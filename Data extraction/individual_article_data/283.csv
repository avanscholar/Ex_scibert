0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an important raw material for today chemical and petroleum industry and is considered a convenient and clean energy vector, because energy produced from this gas generates water vapor as the only byproduct. Otherwise, hydrogen can be produced from traditional fossil fuel sources such as petroleum, natural gas and coal as well as from renewable sources such as solar, wind, biomass and solid wastes [1]. Today, fossil fuel reserves are in the way of depletion, since crude oil (a non-renewable resource), cannot continue to meet the ongoing demand. Particularly, oil production has become limited by the current capacity of extraction technology, causing supply and demand curves to diverge. Therefore, the age of cheap liquid fuels is coming to an end, and a condition of meeting additional demand is to develop unconventional resources, which translates to an increase in the price of petroleum products. Furthermore, the capacity to meet liquid fuel demand is depending upon the fast and immediate diversification of liquid fuels and the transition to alternative energy carriers where applicable, and demand side measures such as behavioral change and adaptation [1]. Two main important issues are considered in the fossil fuel substitution; clean and environmentally friendly fuels and the improvement of the energy conversion efficiency to produce them. In recent years, fuel cells have become an option for highly efficient power generation based on renewable hydrogen. Throughout the years, hydrogen has been an important raw material in the chemical and petroleum industries. Moreover, it might become a part of a new generation of clean energy carriers aimed for transportation, especially toward fuel cell applications, and this would cause a huge increase in the hydrogen demand. Today 95% of hydrogen production is based on the steam reforming of natural gas [2]. However, there is an expected increase in hydrogen demand that is related to fuel cell applications, which will drive the development of new production methods, particularly from renewable sources. The use of biofuels (ethanol, diesel, etc.) for hydrogen production, through conventional industrial processes (steam reforming, partial oxidation and dry reforming), presents the advantage of a zero CO2 balance during the biofuels conversion, since the carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere can be absorbed during the biomass formation process [3]. Ethanol and methanol are considered potential candidates for hydrogen production from biomass [4]. Bio-ethanol can be obtained from different biomass sources, which include; energy crops, agro industrial wastes, organic material from urban solid wastes, etc. On the other hand, bio-methanol as a second generation biofuel can also be considered as a suitable feedstock for hydrogen production. Methanol is conventionally produced from fossil natural gas or by coal gasification, while biomethanol is made from biogas generated exclusively from renewable and non-food crop related resources [5]. It is important to state that from these two potential fuels (ethanol and methanol) methanol presents the highest value in hydrogen/carbon (H/C) atomic ratio and this means that in principle its conversion could lead to a high purity hydrogen stream with expected low carbon formation. Otherwise, the steam reforming of ethanol and/or methanol, which are oxygenated hydrocarbons, is rather thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures than non-oxygenated hydrocarbons such as methane [6]. Steam reforming of methanol and ethanol for hydrogen production follow the next stoichiometric reactions: (1) CH 3 OH ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) = CO 2 ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 ° = 48.2 kJ / mol (2) C 2 H 6 O ( g ) + 3 H 2 O ( g ) = 2 CO 2 ( g ) + 6 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 ° = 171.2 kJ / mol Even though these reactions appear to be simple, these are accompanied with a complex reaction system of undesired reaction paths. Therefore, the hydrogen selectivity is dictated and limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction system. For proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) applications the maximum hydrogen production can be carried out in three steps. The first step is the conversion of the biofuel into H2, CH4, CO and CO2 (steam reforming) followed by a low temperature step where most of the CO produced is converted in CO2 and additional H2 by the water gas shift reaction (WGS): (3) CO ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) = CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 ° = − 41.2 kJ / mol Since the WGS is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium the CO concentration after this step is still high to be used in the PEMFC anode where a CO concentration greater than 50 ppm will cause poisoning of the platinum catalyst. Consequently, a third step should be carried out, which consists in the elimination of carbon monoxide through a preferential oxidation process (polishing step). Finally, in order to generate electric energy, oxygen and the high purity hydrogen produced can be used as a feedstock for a PEMFC. The need for a high purity hydrogen stream for PEMFC applications, has led to the scientific community to propose alternate processes such as the absorption enhanced reforming (AER). This AER process provides a promising alternative for a single step high purity hydrogen production [7]. The fundamental concept of this process is based in the Le Chatellier's principle in which the reaction equilibrium can be shifted toward the production of hydrogen when CO2 is removed in situ within the reforming reactor. Thus if the carbon dioxide generated during the steam reforming step is removed from the gas phase using a solid CO2 absorbent such as CaO the hydrogen production will be enhanced. In the AER reactor a mixture of a CO2 absorbent (for example CaO) and a reforming catalyst will theoretically produce a high purity hydrogen stream in one single step. The combination of the CO2 absorption by CaO through the reaction: (4) CaO + CO 2 ( g ) = CaCO 3 Δ H 298 ° = − 178.3 kJ / mol and the steam reforming of methanol and ethanol lead to the following reactions: (5) CH 3 OH ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) + CaO = CaCO 3 + 3 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 ° = − 130 kJ / mol (6) C 2 H 6 O ( g ) + 3 H 2 O ( g ) + 2 CaO = 2 CaCO 3 + 6 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 ° = − 185.3 kJ / mol Comparing equations (1) and (2) with equations (5) and (6), it is evident that the use of a CO2 absorbent changed from endothermic steam reforming reactions to exothermic reactions, which implies potential energy savings with the use of both biofuels. However, this absorbent must be regenerated if a continuous process is desired and then the high endothermic reverse reaction (4) will eventually be required to be performed. Thermodynamic analyses and experimental studies related to the use of simultaneous CO2 removal using CaO as absorbent combined with the steam reforming of methanol and/or ethanol for hydrogen production has been reported by several authors [8,9]. However, calcium-base absorbents lose more than half of their absorption capacity after several absorption/regeneration cycles (typically five), with the exception of calcined dolomite (CaO*MgO) which is able to withstand several cycles with minor deterioration. The loss of capacity in these absorbents is due to sintering of the materials consequence of the high temperature required for their regeneration (T > 900 °C) [10]. Therefore, the use of a suitable absorbent that combines relatively low regeneration temperatures and good multicycle performance is highly desirable. Recent studies have aimed the development of synthetic CO2 absorbents. Compounds such as: lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4), lithium zirconate (Li2ZrO3) [11] and sodium zirconate (Na2ZrO3) [12], which are able to withstand many carbonation/regeneration cycles without important loss of CO2 absorption capacity and activity at high temperatures. Therefore, these synthetic absorbents have become potential candidates to be used under the proposed AER process. In the present study, a thermodynamic analysis of steam reforming of two light alcohols, methanol and ethanol, with and without the use of a CO2 absorbent was carried out to determine favorable operating conditions to produce a high purity hydrogen stream suitable for PEMFC applications. The CO2 absorbents studied were; CaO, CaO*MgO, Na2ZrO3, Li2ZrO3 and Li4SiO4. The influence of steam-to-fuel feed molar ratio and temperature on the product gas concentration was investigated for all cases. Also, in the AER reaction system, pressure was kept at atmospheric conditions. Results are compared with experimental (where available) and theoretical data generated and found in existing literature. Furthermore, it is expected that during the steam reforming of alcohols, carbon deposition over catalysts may be the main cause for deactivation, resulting in low durability and activity loss. Therefore, additionally a study of conditions where this carbon deposition is expected with and without the use of a CO2 absorbent is presented. Finally, the thermal efficiency is evaluated in the conventional steam reforming and AER processes for each absorbent studied."
1,Simulation calculations,
2,Gibbs free energy minimization technique,"2.1 Gibbs free energy minimization technique In a reaction system where many simultaneous reactions take place, equilibrium calculations can be performed through the Gibbs energy minimization approach (also called the non-stoichiometric method). In this technique the total free energy of the system consisting of an ideal gas phase and pure condensed phases, can be expressed as: (7) G R T = { ∑ i = 1 N n i G i ° R T + ln ( y i P ) } gas + 1 R T { ∑ i = 1 N n i G i ° } condensed The technique is based in finding different values of n i which minimizes the objective function (7) and subjected to the constraints of the elemental mass balance: (8) ∑ i = 1 N a i j n i = A j , j = 1 , 2 , 3 … , k where a ij is the number of atoms of the jth element in a mole of the ith species. A j is defined as the total number of atoms of the jth element in the reaction mixture [13]. All calculations were performed through the using the equilibrium module of the HSC chemistry software for windows [14]. HSC calculates the equilibrium composition of all possible combination of reactions that are able to take place within the thermodynamic system. These equilibrium calculations make use of the equilibrium composition module of the HSC program that is based on the Gibbs free energy minimization technique. The GIBBS program of this module finds the most stable phase combination and seeks the phase compositions where the Gibbs free energy of the system reaches its minimum (equation (7)) at a fixed mass balance (a constraint minimization problem, equation (8)), constant pressure and temperature. In this non-stoichiometric approach every species in the system must be defined. The selection of feasible products should be based on previous experimental results found in the literature. For each system the possible species are specified based on reported experimental and thermodynamic analysis studies. In the methanol and ethanol steam reforming system the species included were: ethanol, ethylene, ethane, acetone, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, C, CO, CH4, CO2, H2, and H2O and these were based on reported experimental species found in the literature [15–17]. Identical conditions were used for the cases where a CO2 absorbent was included, with the exception that two solid phases were added; solid and elemental carbon. In the case of CO2 absorbent CaO, the species Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 were added. For dolomite were: CaO*MgO, CaO, CaCO3, MgCO3 and MgO. For sodium zirconate were: Na2ZrO3, Na2CO3 and ZrO2. For lithium zirconate were: Li2ZrO3, Li2CO3 and ZrO2 and finally for lithium orthosilicate were: Li4SiO4, Li2CO3 and Li2SiO3 all of these correspond to the following carbonation reactions: (9) CaO ∗ MgO + CO 2 ( g ) = CaCO 3 + MgO Δ H 298 ° = − 170.9 kJ / mol (10) Na 2 ZrO 3 + CO 2 ( g ) = Na 2 CO 3 + ZrO 2 Δ H 298 ° = − 151.5 kJ / mol (11) Li 2 ZrO 3 + CO 2 ( g ) = Li 2 CO 3 + ZrO 2 Δ H 298 ° = − 162.5 kJ / mol (12) Li 4 SiO 4 + CO 2 ( g ) = Li 2 CO 3 + Li 2 SiO 3 Δ H 298 ° = − 142.2 kJ / mol During the simulation work the reaction temperature was varied in the range of 300–850 °C at 1 atm. Steam to alcohol (S/COH) molar feed ratio varied from 1:1 (stoichiometric) to 6:1 for methanol and from 3:1 (stoichiometric) to 6:1 for ethanol. For the case of the carbon formation study the S/COH molar feed ratio varied from 0.2 to 0.5 for each biofuel."
3,Thermal efficiency calculation,"2.2 Thermal efficiency calculation In the present work, the calculation procedure for thermal efficiency was based on the approach developed by He and coworkers and da Silva and Muller [8,18]. Details for the equations and calculations methods can be found in those studies. Calculated values for the LHV of hydrogen, ethanol and methanol were 239.2, 1240, and 651.7 kJ/mol, respectively. According to equations (1) and (2) the maximum thermal efficiency for converting a biofuel with steam can be found by assuming that one mol of fuel produce 3 and 6 mol of H2, for methanol and ethanol, respectively. And this is true if only the reforming reaction may take place in the system. However, it has to be considered that each reaction system is thermodynamically limited and therefore a complex network of reactions occur in this leading to a non-trivial equilibrium composition that will eventually dictate the thermal efficiency of the reaction system. Otherwise, the equilibrium composition and energy requirements depend on reaction conditions. Reaction enthalpy was calculated according to each HSC equilibrium system. For the AER system the procedure to calculate the thermal efficiency is also described according to similar thermodynamic studies [8,18]. The only difference with respect to those studies is that HSC takes into account the fact that the feed to the reactor is composed by the biofuel, steam and a solid CO2 absorbent (typically 50% excess). Therefore, the thermal efficiency depends on the production of hydrogen and the required consumption of heat (heat duty) employed to regenerate the solid CO2 absorbent. All the previous description of the simulation calculations is based on theoretical thermodynamic considerations and these are to be taken as a guide to further experimental evaluation of the reaction systems, since no heat and mass diffusional limitations as well as kinetics effects were taken into account for the conformation of the present thermodynamic analysis."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Thermodynamically possible products,"3.1 Thermodynamically possible products During the equilibrium calculations the HSC program requires the input of all possible chemical species present in the system as reactants and products. For the steam reforming system with and without absorbents the species considered at equilibrium were all gaseous and solid species already described in Section 2.1 and the ones that were found in the current literature that appear when each biofuel is converted along with other intermediate oxygenated hydrocarbons. For the ethanol reforming system the additional intermediate species considered were: ethylene, ethane, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and acetone [8,9,19–21]. Whereas, for the methanol steam reforming no additional compounds were included in the calculations, since no other species were reported as additional byproducts in the literature. In practice alcohol steam reforming reactions are under kinetic control, where suitable catalysts and supports are able to completely convert all the biofuels to avoid intermediate products. All this agrees well with the fact that only trace amounts (less than 1 ppm) of these oxygenated intermediates were found in all the thermodynamic calculations performed and therefore these were not reported in the present study."
6,Steam reforming of ethanol system (SRE validation),"3.2 Steam reforming of ethanol system (SRE validation) Calculations for the ethanol steam reforming system (SRE) are briefly mentioned in this section in order to compare and validate results obtained in the present work with those reported in the literature. This system focused on the effects of temperature, steam to ethanol molar feed ratio (S/E), hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 , defined as moles of H2 produced at equilibrium per moles of ethanol fed to the system) and H2 dry basis gas concentration (% H2) in the product. This Y H 2 is a way to quantitatively compare different reactions systems (with and without a CO2 absorbent) for the hydrogen production at equilibrium. The S/E was varied from 3:1 (stoichiometric) to 6:1 in a temperature range of 300–900 °C. Results indicate that the production of CO and H2 increase as temperature rises. On the other hand, low temperatures generate small CO and H2 concentrations (as low as 10% H2 at 300 °C), while CO2 (25%) and CH4 (66%) were the predominant gaseous species (see Supplemental material). These results are explained by the following methanation reactions: (13) 2 CO ( g ) + 2 H 2 ( g ) = CH 4 ( g ) + CO 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 ° = − 247.4 kJ / mol (14) CO 2 ( g ) + 4 H 2 ( g ) = CH 4 ( g ) + 2 H 2 O ( g ) Δ H 298 ° = − 169.9 kJ / mol (15) CO 2 ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) = CH 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) Δ H 298 ° = − 206.2 kJ / mol (16) C ( s ) + 2 H 2 ( g ) = CH 4 ( g ) Δ H 298 ° = − 74.8 kJ / mol At low temperatures all the CO and H2 produced are almost consumed by reactions (13)–(16) with the consequent generation of methane and CO2 as main gas species. Also, a locus of maximum Y H 2 was found between 600 and 700 °C at any S/E ratio examined (see Supplemental material). The hydrogen yield also increased with the increment of the S/E ratio (for example, Y H 2 = 4.4 at S/E = 3 and Y H 2 = 4.9 at S/E = 9). Higher vales than S/E = 6, only increased the Y H 2 marginally, since S/E = 6 produced an Y H 2 of 5.0 and S/E = 6.5 of 5.1. Also, it is important to state that a greater amount of hydrogen is produced as the S/E increased toward lower temperatures. This behavior can be attributed to the reverse WGS reaction. The above results were consistent with previous thermodynamic analysis of this system performed by Fishtik et al. and Lima da Silva and Müller [8,22]. These authors claim that methane dry reforming (reverse reaction (13)) and steam reforming (reverse reactions (14) and (15)) domain at temperatures greater than 550 °C. Also, this is in agreement with experimental findings of Li et al. [23] who reported the effect of temperature on the product gas composition for the ethanol steam reforming over a NiMg6 catalyst for a S/E = 6. As temperature was increased from 450 to 700 °C, they observed a gradual decrease in CO2 and CH4 concentrations, while CO and H2 increased in this range. The present study generated a CO and H2 concentrations of 1.27 and 49.7% at 450 °C to 12.61 and 71.6% at 700 °C, respectively, while CO2 and CH4 concentrations varied from 24.04 to 15.5 and from 24.9 to 0.28 mol%, respectively. These former values are very close to those observed by Li et al. and others [21,23–25]. Therefore, it can be concluded that their experiments were not kinetically limited, since all equilibrium compositions were almost achieved and that the present thermodynamic analysis can be validated with the experimental data and other previous studies reported in the literature."
7,Absorption enhanced reforming of ethanol thermodynamic results,"3.3 Absorption enhanced reforming of ethanol thermodynamic results Table 1 presents results of the thermodynamic equilibrium for the absorption enhanced reforming using CaO, CaO*MgO, Na2ZrO3, Li2ZrO3 and Li4SiO4 as CO2 absorbents. Feed consisted in 1 kmol of ethanol, 2.5 kmol of absorbent and the required steam for each S/E ratio. The amount of absorbent represents a 50% excess over the stoichiometric value (2.5 kmol absorbent/2 kmol CO2 produced at reaction (6)). This was established from experimental experience in which a 50% excess was found to reach almost equilibrium compositions on the AER of methane [26]. In this table equilibrium amounts for each species are expressed in terms of product yields ( Y H 2 , Y CO , Y CO 2 and Y CH 4 ) , which represent the amount of kmoles produced at equilibrium per kmole of ethanol fed to the system. AER systems were studied at 300–800 °C and 1 atm. Steam to ethanol (S/E) molar feed ratio varied from 3:1 (stoichiometric) to 6:1. Also, Table 2 presents these results in terms of the dry equilibrium compositions in mol % under the same conditions as in Table 1. 3.3.1 AER of ethanol CaO absorbent According to results presented in Table 1 calculations of the AER of ethanol using the CaO absorbent produced an enhancement of the product hydrogen yield. The locus of maximum Y H 2 varied from 4.8 at 700 °C and S/E = 3 to 5.6 at 600 °C and S/E = 6, again it generated a great difference in Y H 2 as the S/E increased from 3 to 6, with only a marginal increase at S/E = 6.5 ( Y H 2 = 5.7 , not shown in Table 1). While, a maximum Y H 2 = 5 was achieved in the SRE system (without absorbent), which represents 12.7% less than with the use of CaO. Results in terms of the dry-basis hydrogen concentration as a function of temperature and S/E ratio (Table 2) produced an almost constant H2 concentration at low temperatures (300–600 °C) and this concentration increased as the S/E also rose. The H2 concentration at 500 °C varied from 90.8% at S/E = 3–98.0% at S/E = 6. Greater temperature values than ≈600 °C will eventually decrease the hydrogen % in the product gas. This can be attributed to the decrease of the ability of the CaO absorbent to capture CO2 at high temperatures at the corresponding CO2 partial pressure, since the carbonation reaction (4) is highly exothermic, which indicates that the CO2 separation from the gas phase is inhibited at high temperatures. Also it can be inferred that S/E values greater than 6 do not represent a significant increase in Y H 2 as well as in %H2 content. This means that a limit of S/E = 6 may play a significant role in determining if greater S/E values would represent an economical benefit (higher Y H 2 ) compared to the cost of steam generation. Lima Da Silva and Müller [8] reported that in the AER process, using CaO as absorbent the hydrogen concentration was greatly enhanced, achieving a concentration as high as 99.9 mol% at 500 °C and S/E = 6. A comparison with results presented in Table 2 show slightly lower values (98% H2) than the ones reported by da Silva and Müller. This can be due to the amount of absorbent used in the present calculations, which is not mentioned in that study, since this parameter plays an important role in the availability of the absorbent (CaO) to be carbonated at specific reaction conditions. Furthermore, results in that study include the possible formation of Ca(OH)2, which is not feasible to be formed at low pressure conditions as experimentally demonstrated by Han and Harrison [27]. Similar results were found by Wu et al. [28] at 700 °C and S/E = 3 with a Y H 2 = 4.5 , while a value from Table 1 at the same conditions was Y H 2 = 4.8 . On the other hand, carbon dioxide concentrations were almost negligible at temperatures below 500 °C for all S/E ratios (Table 2). Greater temperature values resulted in increased CO2 concentrations as high as 5.6% at 800 °C and S/E = 3, while at the same temperature a 9.9% CO2 with S/E = 6.5 is generated. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that at low temperatures the ability of the CaO to capture CO2 is enhanced due to the exothermic nature of the carbonation reaction. Also, at high temperatures, greater amounts of steam will promote the steam reforming reaction, thus producing more CO2 susceptible of being carbonated. Calculations also indicated that the mayor contamination of the product gas at intermediate temperatures (300–600 °C) is due to methane formation. The effect of the S/E on the CH4 composition was evident, since at temperatures below 700 °C the methanation reactions above described are favored (17–21). However, as the amount of steam is increased the methane concentration at 500 °C falls from 9% at S/E = 3 to a value of 1.8% at S/E = 6. This behavior can be explained by the enhancement of the steam reforming and WGS reactions at intermediate temperatures (300–600 °C) by the use of a CO2 absorbent, thus producing a higher H2 content and lower methane concentrations. Furthermore, the CO concentration (ppm) in the product gas as a function of S/E and temperature can be compared to the threshold value of 10 ppm, which indicates the maximum amount of CO suitable as a feed in a PEMFC in order to avoid poisoning of the Pt catalyst [8,22]. According to present thermodynamic calculations presented in Table 2, it is important to notice that at temperatures below 500 °C the effect of the S/E is almost negligible, since there are no differences in CO composition at different steam contents in this region. A temperature of 450 °C is necessary in order to assure a CO concentration equal or below 10 ppm CO. Also, the effect of the CaO absorbent enhances the WGS and steam reforming reactions at temperatures lower than 550 °C, thus reducing the CO content below this temperature. Higher temperatures than 550 °C will increase CO in the product gas as the WGS would no longer be favored. 3.3.2 AER of ethanol CaO*MgO absorbent Thermodynamic calculations of the AER of ethanol using calcined dolomite (CaO*MgO) absorbent also produced an enhancement in the hydrogen production as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Results indicate a locus of maximum hydrogen production as the S/E increases (see Supplemental material). For example, at S/E = 3 a Y H 2 of 4.8 is achieved at 700 °C, while at S/E = 6 a Y H 2 of 5.6 can be produced at 600 °C. These results are for practical purposes the same as with the use of CaO as absorbent. However, the durability of this mineral is several orders of magnitude greater than CaO and this dolomite can withstand as many as 15 carbonation/decarbonation cycles without significant deterioration [26]. A careful examination of results from Table 2 shows how the general trends for each gaseous species behave as a function of temperature and S/E ratio. For the case of hydrogen a concentration as high as 97% can be achieved at 500 °C and S/E = 6. At low temperatures the hydrogen concentration remains high, except for the cases of lower than stoichiometric S/E values (<3). Carbon oxides (CO and CO2) concentrations are small at low temperatures as a consequence of the CO2 absorption enhancement effect of the dolomite and gradually increase as temperature is raised (S/E = 6 and 700 °C) to values up to 7.6 and 7.8% for CO and CO2, respectively. In Table 2 it is evident that the mayor contaminant of the product gas is methane and this decreases as the temperature and S/E ratio increases, thus enhancing the steam reforming reaction. 3.3.3 AER of ethanol Na2ZrO3 absorbent Thermodynamic calculations related to the hydrogen production yield ( Y H 2 ) as a function of temperature and S/E ratio for the Na2ZrO3 absorbent presented a maximum of Y H 2 = 5.4 at 700 °C and S/E of 6 (Table 1). The nature of these results resembles those observed for dolomite and CaO. However, the main difference is that at low temperatures (≈300 °C) the Y H 2 remains lower than that observed for CaO or dolomite. This behavior can be explained in terms of the different thermodynamic nature of the absorbents. For example, the Gibbs free energy of their carbonation reactions for CaO, CaO*MgO and Na2ZrO3 at 300 °C are −87, −79 and −66 kJ/mol, respectively. While at high temperatures (≈650 °C) this difference in Gibbs free energy is small. Therefore, the ability for the Na2ZrO3 to capture CO2 at low temperatures (T < 500 °C) is hindered by the nature of the absorbent. However, at high temperatures the absorbent is able to generate a Y H 2 quite comparable to those above reported for CaO and dolomite. Also from Table 2 it can be seen that even at low temperatures the hydrogen concentrations remain high (>80% H2) and eventually peak to a maximum of 94% H2 at 500 °C and S/E = 6. Greater temperatures than 600 °C will produce as in previous absorbents (CaO and CaO*MgO) a gradual decrease of the hydrogen content in the gas product. The production of carbon oxides at low temperatures are somewhat a bit higher than with previous absorbents due to the behavior above described. Finally, a temperature of 380 °C is needed in order to assure a CO concentration of ≤10 ppm. 3.3.4 AER of ethanol Li2ZrO3 absorbent Results for the steam reforming of ethanol using Li2ZrO3 as CO2 absorbent were very similar to those presented for Na2ZrO3. In fact, the trend of the Y H 2 as a function of temperature and S/E was the same. Only slight differences appeared since a maximum Y H 2 of 5.5 can be obtained at 651 °C and S/E of 6 (Table 2). Otherwise, the trends of all gaseous species in the product gas were essentially the same, with a maximum H2 concentration of 94% at 500 °C and S/E of 6. All these similarities can be explained in terms of the thermodynamic nature of these absorbents. A comparison in terms of the Gibbs free energy of the carbonation reactions (10) and (11) at 600 °C results in very small differences since Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3 show values of −24.58 and −23.53 kJ/mol, respectively. A comparison with a recent thermodynamic study by Wu et al. [28] present very close values to the ones reported in Table 1. Values in that study at 700 °C and S/E = 3 report a Y H 2 , Y CO , Y CO 2 and Y CH 4 of 4.4, 1.1, 0.52 and 0.1, respectively. While, values reported in Table 1 at the same conditions were: 4.7, 0.68, 0.22 and 0.14, respectively. Differences can be attributed to the amount of absorbent employed in that study, which used 2 mol of Li2ZrO3/mol of ethanol; while a 50% excess of Li2ZrO3 was used (2.5 mol) in the present study. 3.3.5 AER of ethanol Li4SiO4 absorbent Thermodynamic calculations for the AER of ethanol using Li4SiO4 as CO2 produced a maximum of Y H 2 of 5.3 at 700 °C and S/E of 6 (see Table 1). The separation of the Y H 2 values appeared to be closer to each other at each S/E ratio compared to the ones for Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3. This behavior reflects the fact that the hydrogen production is somewhat limited by the absorption ability of Li4SiO4 to capture CO2, especially at low temperatures (≈300 °C). This is more evident when a comparison is made between the values of Y H 2 for S/E ratios 5 and 6. This means that the maximum hydrogen production yield ( Y H 2 ) can be found at ratios closer to 5 rather than with Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3, which maximum appears to be closer to 6. Equilibrium concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 as a function of temperature and S/E ratio for the Li4SiO4 absorbent are reported in Table 2. According to these results it can be seen that the trends of all gaseous species in the product gas were similar to those presented for the zirconates. However, the values for hydrogen concentrations were lower accompanied with higher values of methane, especially at low temperatures. This was reflected in the maximum H2 concentration which was 85% at 600 °C and S/E of 6 (see Table 2). These results can be explained in terms of the products from reaction (12) compared to reactions (10) and (11). Both zirconates once reacted generate the corresponding alkali carbonates (Na2CO3 and Li2ZrO3) and ZrO2. Whereas, L4SiO4 (lithium orthosilicate) generate the carbonate (Li2CO3) accompanied with another silicate specie; lithium methasilicate (Li2SiO3). This methasilicate changes somewhat the reactivity of Li4SiO4 toward CO2 thus producing a greater value of the Gibbs free energy compared to those presented by the zirconates. For example ΔG 600°C = −12.5 kJ/mol, is almost half of the value shown for the zirconates. 3.3.6 Absorbent comparison for ethanol reforming A summary of simulation results for the steam reforming of ethanol with and without the use of a CO2 absorbent is presented below. Conditions compared (see Tables 1 and 2) were close to the maximum hydrogen production obtained for each absorbent and these were; S/E = 6:1 and at 600 °C. This temperature was chosen because it represents the average of the maximum hydrogen production in all performed calculations. These values make evident the limitation of the steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) without absorbent, since only 4.5 mol of H2 were produced per mol of ethanol ( Y H 2 ) . Even at this relatively high temperature the yields of CO, CH4 and CO2 are relatively high, with 0.23, 0.54 and 1.23 at equilibrium, respectively. Also the hydrogen concentration was only of 69%. The expected enhancement with the use of a CO2 absorbent is clear when a comparison is made with respect to the values obtained for CaO. In Table 1 the increase in hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) was of 19.2% greater with the use of CaO. Consequently, other gaseous species were reduced. CO, CO2 and CH4 were reduced 3.3, 15.4 and 10.8 times, respectively. All this was translated into a very high hydrogen concentration of 97%. Other absorbents behaved similarly to the results presented in the previous section. For example, calcined dolomite (CaO*MgO) exhibited only a small difference in results with respect to CaO. Since, the hydrogen production was reduced only 3.5%, while CO and CO2 were increased 57 and 75% from the values produced using CaO. However, these values were 16% higher in H2 production and 25% in hydrogen concentration (94%) compared to conventional SR (69%). Results for the zirconate absorbents Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3 were very similar between them and to the ones for CaO*MgO as can be seen in Table 1. For example, hydrogen production yields for Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3 were the same (5.4) compared to 5.5 for CaO*MgO. Equilibrium yields of CO followed the same trend, while CO2 presented only a slight decrease for the zirconate absorbents compared to those produced by calcined dolomite (0.14 compared to 0.20 and 0.21) and the same trend occurred with methane formation. However, hydrogen concentration was just slightly less for the zirconates (92%) compared to the concentration produced by calcined dolomite (94%, Table 2). Finally, Li4SiO4 was the absorbent that produced the lowest hydrogen production and higher byproduct concentrations (CO, CO2 and CH4). This was translated into a reduced hydrogen concentration of only 85%. This behavior can be attributed to the thermodynamic nature of this absorbent as explained above. Therefore, a crucial feature within the hydrogen production through the absorption enhanced reforming (AER) of ethanol and/or methanol resides in nature of the CO2 solid absorbent, which apart from favorable thermodynamics, must present adequate absorption capacity and fast absorption-regeneration kinetics. Several researches have focused their studies in the effects of pressure, temperature and gas reactant composition on absorbents based on calcium oxide (CaO) using the thermogravimetric (TGA) experimental technique [27,29]. However, sintering of these materials reduce their performance after several absorption–regeneration cycles. Calcined dolomite (CaO*MgO) has shown to better perform in CO2 absorption at high temperatures compared to CaO in multicycle tests [29]. Unfortunately, this mineral origin absorbent requires high regeneration temperatures (T ≥ 950 °C) that produce degradation of the material after 10 absorption-regeneration cycles. Bandi et al. [30] proposed the use of the mineral huntite (Mg3Ca(CO3)4) exhibiting good regeneration performance. However, this absorbent has several disadvantages such as: a high regeneration temperature and low CO2 capacity. Also of mineral origin the Mg6Al2(CO3)(OH)16*4H2O hydrotalcite was proposed by Hufton et al. [31] and Ding and Alpay [32] which used this CO2 adsorbent at moderate temperatures (400–500 °C) resulting in low adsorption capacity. Studies from López Ortiz et al. [12], have shown the superior performance of Na2ZrO3 as an alternate synthetic CO2 solid absorbent compared to expensive lithium-base absorbents (Li2ZrO3 and Li4SiO4) (Nakagawa and Ohashi [33] and Kato et al. [34]). This behavior was attributed on its excellent thermal stability, kinetics and CO2 capture capacity features. Recently, Ochoa Fernandez et al. [35], have experimentally evaluated several synthetic CO2 absorbents, under the AER of methane reaction scheme, such as: Li2ZrO3, LiSiO4 and Na2ZrO3 and concluded that Na2ZrO3 is the one that better performed toward high methane conversions, hydrogen purity and reaction kinetics. Furthermore, Jakobsen and Halmøy [36] performed a reactor modeling of the sorption enhanced steam methane reforming using CaO, Li4SiO4 and Na2ZrO3 and also concluded that Na2ZrO3 is the most efficient absorbent with the highest hydrogen purity (92.6%) compared to CaO (79.3%) and Li4SiO4 (82.1%) at the same reaction conditions in a temperature range from 600 °C to 800 °C. Therefore, from the above presented thermodynamic analysis of the AER of ethanol it can be concluded that Na2ZrO3 is a promising alternate absorbent with comparable thermodynamics and greater kinetics and stability. Furthermore, modeling results agreed with experimental evaluation of ethanol reforming using CaO*MgO, and Na2ZrO3."
8,Steam reforming of methanol (SRM) thermodynamic results,"3.4 Steam reforming of methanol (SRM) thermodynamic results 3.4.1 Gas product distribution without absorbent Thermodynamic calculations for the equilibrium hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) and H2 concentration (%) as a function of temperature (300–800 °C) and S/M ratio (1–6) were performed and are presented in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively. In those Tables feed consisted in 1 kmol of methanol, 1.5 kmol of absorbent and the required steam for each steam to methanol ratio (S/M). The amount of absorbent represents a 50% excess over the stoichiometric value (1.5 kmol absorbent/1 kmol CO2 produced at reaction (5)). Results indicate a maximum of Y H 2 = 2.22 at 725 °C and S/M of 1 (stoichiometric condition, see Supplemental material). As the S/M increased from 1 to 6 the Y H 2 was also raised toward values located at lower temperatures. For example, a maximum of Y H 2 = 2.76 was achieved at 595 °C and S/M of 6 (see Supplemental material). This behavior, as in the ethanol reforming, can be explained by the promotion of the methanation reactions at low temperatures (300–500 °C). On the other hand, at stoichiometric conditions (S/M = 1), a maximum hydrogen concentration of 69% was reached at 731 °C. Again, the increase in S/M ratio resulted in higher hydrogen concentrations at lower temperatures. Since a value of 73% was reached at 576 °C and S/M of 6 (see Supplemental material). These results agree well with thermodynamic analysis of methanol reforming (71–74% H2, at similar conditions) reported by Lima da Silva and Müller [8]. Analysis of results for the carbon oxide equilibrium compositions for methanol reforming resulted in CO generation at relatively small concentrations at low temperatures (300–500 °C) and as temperature increases CO concentrations also is raised and can be as high as 19.6% at 700 °C and S/M ratio of 6. CO production at high temperature is generated through the dry reforming and steam reforming reactions, reverse reactions (13) and (15), respectively. That is the reason why the CO concentration is increased at high temperatures (T > 500 °C), while CO2 and CH4 concentrations are lowered in this particular region. Also, a low level of 10 ppm of CO never was reached within the generated data, since the lowest possible CO concentration was 0.042% which represents a value of 420 ppm of CO at 300 °C and S/M ratio of 6. Furthermore, the CO2 concentration is high at relatively low temperatures (300–500 °C). This is due to the methanation reaction (13), which favors the production of CO2 and methane at low temperatures. Also, as temperature is increased CO2 is reduced due to the dry reforming reaction (reverse reaction (13)) and to the fact that the WGS is no longer favorable at these conditions."
9,Absorption enhanced reforming of methanol thermodynamic results,"3.5 Absorption enhanced reforming of methanol thermodynamic results 3.5.1 Gas product distribution with CaO as CO2 absorbent Table 4 shows results for all the gaseous species concentrations (%) as a function of temperature and S/M ratios for the steam reforming of methanol with CaO as a CO2 absorbent. In this table it can be seen how the general trends for each gaseous species behave as a function of temperature and S/M ratio. For the case of hydrogen a concentration as high as 99.9% can be achieved at 500 °C and S/M = 6. At low temperatures the hydrogen concentration remains high, even for the case of the stoichiometric value (92% H2 at 544 °C, S/M = 1). For carbon oxides (CO and CO2) both concentrations are very small at low temperatures as a result of the CO2 absorption enhancement effect of CaO and gradually increased as temperature was raised (T > 500 °C) to values up to 2.7 and 7.4% for CO and CO2 (S/M = 6, 700 °C), respectively. Furthermore, a temperature of 500 °C is needed in order to assure a CO concentration of ≤10 ppm (see Table 3). From Table 4 it is clear that the only significant contaminant of the product gas at low temperatures is methane and this decreased as the temperature and S/M ratio also increased, thus enhancing the steam reforming reaction. Greater values than S/M = 2 will insure very low CH4 concentrations (less than 1%) in all the temperature range studied (300–850 °C). These values are very close to those reported by Lima da Silva and Müller [8]. They reported for S/M molar ratios of 2:1–4:1, that it is possible to produce H2 at concentrations of 98.99% in the temperature range of 450–600 °C, with CO and CO2 contents of less than 1.0%. 3.5.2 Gas product distribution with CaO*MgO as CO2 absorbent Also in Table 4 the equilibrium concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 as a function of temperature and S/M ratio for the CaO*MgO absorbent are presented. In this table it can be seen that the concentration profiles for each species generated with the CaO*MgO absorbent are for practical purposes the same as for CaO. The only apparent difference is the slightly higher levels of methane formation at low temperatures (300–500 °C) and in the range of S/M ratios from 1 to 3. Also, a temperature of 450 °C is needed in order to assure a CO concentration of ≤10 ppm. 3.5.3 Gas product distribution with Na2ZrO3 as CO2 absorbent Table 4 shows results of the steam reforming of methanol using Na2ZrO3 as a CO2 absorbent. In this table equilibrium concentrations for gaseous species H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 are presented as a function of temperature and S/M ratio. In this table it can be seen that even at low temperatures the hydrogen concentrations remain high (>80% H2) and eventually peak to a maximum of 98.7% H2 at 472 °C and S/M = 6. Greater temperatures than 600 °C will produce as in previous absorbents (CaO and CaO*MgO) a gradual decrease of the hydrogen content in the product gas. A higher production of carbon oxides than with the use of calcium based absorbents is observed at high temperatures with values as high as 4 and 11.2% for CO and CO2, respectively (T = 700 °C and S/M = 6). This behavior can be explained by thermodynamic nature of the CaO absorbent, which absorption Gibbs free energy at 600 °C is 1.69 times more negative than for the Na-based absorbent (Na2ZrO3). Finally, a temperature of ≈400 °C is needed in order to assure a CO concentration of ≤10 ppm. 3.5.4 Gas product distribution with Li2ZrO3 as CO2 absorbent Table 4 presents results of the steam reforming of methanol equilibrium concentrations using Li2ZrO3 as a CO2 absorbent as a function of temperature and S/M ratio. Results from Table 4 using Li2ZrO3 make evident that the trends and equilibrium concentrations are almost the same as with Na2ZrO3. However, there is a slight difference mainly in the methane formation at low temperatures, which for the Na-based absorbent is slightly higher than Li2ZrO3. For example a value of 16.7% CH4 was generated at 300 °C and S/M ratio of 1 (stoichiometric condition), while a value of 20.4 was produced by Na2ZrO3 at the same conditions. Other than that results were essentially the same between zirconate absorbents. Finally, a temperature of 400 °C is needed in order to insure a CO concentration of ≤10 ppm with this absorbent (at S/M = 6). 3.5.5 Gas product distribution with Li4SiO4 as CO2 absorbent Table 4 also shows the equilibrium concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 as a function of temperature and S/M ratio for the Li4SiO4 absorbent. Results from Table 4 indicate that the trends for all gaseous species in the product gas were similar to those presented for the zirconates. However, the values for hydrogen concentrations were lower and accompanied with higher values of methane, especially at low temperatures. This was reflected in the maximum H2 concentration which was 88.3% at 600 °C and S/E of 6. Also, a temperature of 350 °C is needed in order to insure a CO concentration of ≤100 ppm with this absorbent. 3.5.6 Absorbent comparison for methanol reforming A summary of simulation results for the steam reforming of methanol with and without the use of a CO2 absorbent is presented below. Conditions chosen for comparison purposes were close to the maximum hydrogen production obtained for each absorbent and these were; S/M = 6:1 and at 600 °C. This temperature was chosen because it represents the average of the maximum hydrogen production in all performed calculations. Results of Table 3 exhibit the evident limitation of the steam reforming of methanol (SR) without absorbent, since only 2.77 mol of H2 were produced per mol of methanol ( Y H 2 ) . Even at this relatively high temperature the yields of CO, CO2 and CH4, are relatively high with 0.166, 0.816 and 0.014 mol at equilibrium, respectively. Also the hydrogen concentration was only of 73% (see Table 4). The expected enhancement with the use of a CaO absorbent was not very significant, since a comparison with respect to SRM without the use of an absorbent only represents an increase of 7% in hydrogen production. However, the main difference is achieved in the byproduct gaseous concentrations, which all were significantly reduced. Using CaO, CO, CO2 and CH4 produced were reduced 16.6, 18.5 and 8.5 times, respectively. All this was translated into a very high hydrogen concentration, which for this absorbent was 98%, an increase of about 25% with respect to SR without absorbent. In Tables 3 and 4 it can be observed that most absorbents behaved similarly to the results presented in the previous section. For example, calcined dolomite (CaO*MgO) exhibited only a small difference in results with respect to CaO. Since, the hydrogen production yield was practically the same (2.98 and 2.97), while CO and CO2 were doubled from the values produced using CaO. However, these values were only 2% higher in H2 concentration (96%) compared with CaO and 23% higher to conventional SRM (73%). Results for the zirconate absorbents Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3 were very similar between them and to the ones for CaO*MO as can be seen in Table 3. For example, hydrogen production for Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3 were 2.91 and 2.95 mol at equilibrium ( Y H 2 ) , respectively compared to 2.97 for CaO*MgO. Equilibrium moles of CO followed the same trend, while CO2 moles presented only a slight increase of the zirconate absorbents compared to those produced by calcined dolomite (0.088 compared to 0.169 and 0.138) and the same trend occurred with methane formation. However, hydrogen concentration was just slightly lower for the Na2ZrO3 (94%) compared to the concentration produced by calcined dolomite (96%). Similarly to the case of ethanol reforming, methanol reforming using Li4SiO4 produced the lowest hydrogen production yield and higher byproduct concentrations (CO, CO2 and CH4). This was translated into a lower hydrogen concentration of only 88%. This behavior can be attributed to the limited thermodynamic nature of this absorbent as pointed out before in the ethanol reforming section. Hence, from the above thermodynamic analysis for the absorption enhanced methanol reforming it can be concluded that Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3 are both promising alternate absorbents with comparable thermodynamics to CaO based absorbent. However, greater kinetics and stability can be achieved with the use of Na2ZrO3 [12]. Recent experimental results dealing with conventional methanol steam reforming have used Cu-based catalyst [37,38] and therefore, there is the opportunity to suppress the formation of CH4 over this catalyst. However, it is well known that Cu-based catalysts suffer from deactivation due to sintering of the active Cu at the high operating temperatures (450–600 °C) of the AER process. Therefore, other materials such as Ni-based catalysts can be used in the AER of methanol, as reported by Lysikov et al. [6]."
10,Carbon formation,"3.6 Carbon formation 3.6.1 Carbon formation for the ethanol reforming system Fig. 1 shows the effect of steam to ethanol molar ratios and temperature on the number of moles of carbon (graphite) produced in the steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) and through AER using all the absorbents studied in the present work. In this plot the maximum amount of carbon produced is plotted as a function of the S/E ratio from 0 to 3. In each data point the temperature where the maximum carbon formation was found is specified and this is depicted as a function of the type of CO2 absorbent. In this plot it is evident that without the use of a CO2 absorbent carbon formation is favored and its maximum is reached at lower temperatures than with the use of an absorbent. The SRE produced a maximum carbon formation of 0.96 kmol per mol of ethanol fed to the system at S/E ratio of 0.5 and it is found at a temperature of 577 °C. Greater temperatures and S/E ratios will produce lower amounts of carbon and a S/E ratio greater than 2.5 and higher temperatures than 512 °C will insure a carbon free operation under this system. Surprisingly, the use of different CO2 absorbents produced maximum carbon formations at the same temperatures and S/E ratios, with the exception of Li4SiO4 that deviated from this behavior at greater S/E ratios than 1.5 and at temperatures lower than 670 °C. Therefore, from this point it can be seen that Li4SiO4 is more prompted to produce greater amounts of carbon than the other absorbents studied. Furthermore, for the other absorbents, greater S/E ratios than 1.5 will produce lower amounts of carbon. Carbon free operation can be found at S/E ratios greater than 2.0 for all absorbents with the exception of Li4SiO4 that needs an S/E > 2.5. Also, in general the use of a CO2 absorbent produced smaller carbon formation with respect to conventional reforming (without the use of a CO2 absorbent). This behavior is directly related to the reduction in CO content. Li [20] confirmed in his thermodynamic study, that graphite formation is suppressed with CO2 absorption. According to this author, the Boudouard reaction: (17) 2 CO ( g ) = CO 2 ( g ) + C ( s ) Δ H 298 ° = − 172.5 kJ / mol is shifted toward the reverse Boudouard reaction because its equilibrium constant is related to the square of the CO concentration. 3.6.2 Carbon formation for the methanol reforming system Fig. 2 shows the effect of S/M ratios and temperature on the number of moles of carbon generated under the steam reforming of methanol and through the AER systems. Again as in Fig. 1, the same features in this Figure apply to Fig. 2. As in the case of ethanol reforming it is clear that the use of a CO2 absorbent produce a low tendency to deposit carbon. Without the use of an absorbent, the maximum production of carbon (0.29 mol C/mol of methanol) occurs at 536 °C at a S/M ratio of 0.2:1. Similar temperatures and larger S/E ratios will produce lower amounts of carbon. In order to insure carbon free operation under this system greater S/M ratios than 0.8 and temperatures higher than 520 °C are needed. Similarly to the ethanol system, the use of different CO2 absorbents generated equal maximum carbon formations for all the absorbents at the same temperatures (300–850 °C) and S/M ratios studied (0.2–1). Therefore, the carbon free operation region is the one that presents greater S/M ratios than 0.6 and temperatures higher than 778 °C under AER of methanol reaction. Also, in Fig. 2 it can be observed that either CaO-based (CaO and CaO*MgO) and synthetic absorbents (Na2ZrO3, Li2ZrO3 and Li4SiO4) have the tendency to present relatively the same carbon free operating temperatures. Furthermore, results without the use of a CO2 absorbent are in agreement with the data reported by Faungnawakij et al. [39]."
11,Thermal efficiency analysis,"3.7 Thermal efficiency analysis 3.7.1 Thermal efficiency for ethanol reforming with and without CO2 absorbents Table 5 shows the influence of the S/E ratio on the thermal efficiency (η) at 600 °C. In this table the temperature of 600 °C was chosen because at this condition most of the systems achieved their maximum hydrogen production and concentrations (see previous sections). For the case where no absorbent was employed, the thermal efficiency of the process increased as the S/E ratio also raised. However, as suggested by He et al. [18] the cost of energy for generating extra steam can be compensated by promoting hydrogen production in the reforming process. For example at S/E = 5 the thermal efficiency is 64%, while an increase to 6 produced an efficiency of 66.3%, which reflects the behavior above described. However, a further increase in S/E ratio to 6.5 only produced a marginal increase to 67% in thermal efficiency. These values are in agreement with studies reported by Lima da Silva and Müller [8]. This above behavior was expected, since the factor that has greater impact on the thermal efficiency is the amount of hydrogen produced. Previous calculations performed in Section 3.2 revealed that an increase in S/E ratio from 5 to 6 and even to 6.5 produced only a marginal increase in hydrogen production. Therefore, here it can be concluded that S/E = 6 and 600 °C are a good choice for conditions where all the absorbents can be compared in terms of thermal efficiency. Also in Table 5 the values for the thermal efficiency for the AER of ethanol are reported for every absorbent studied. The use of CaO produced a thermal efficiency of 82.6%, while an increase in S/E ratio of 6.5 slightly reduced its efficiency to a value of 81.9%. This means that the amount of steam generated can eventually reduce the efficiency of the system, since not only the gaseous species absorb the heat provided by the steam but the solid absorbent also takes some of that heat. However, the advantage in the use of a CO2 absorbent (CaO) resulted in an increase in thermal efficiency of 16.3%, which represents significant energy savings generated by the AER process. The use of calcined dolomite only reduced the thermal efficiency in 2% with respect to CaO. This is understandable if it is considered that a solid inert (MgO) is used along with the main absorbent compound (CaO). The same behavior is observed for Na2ZrO3, Li2ZrO3 and Li4SiO4, which resulted in slightly lower efficiencies than CaO with values of 78.3, 77.9 and 73.5%, respectively. The differences observed can be explained in terms of their differences in regeneration temperatures, heats of reaction and regeneration and hydrogen produced. Therefore, it is a complex combination of parameters that generates a specific thermal efficiency. From results of Table 5 it can be seen that the synthetic absorbent that better performs in terms of thermal efficiency is Na2ZrO3, followed by Li2ZrO3 with a small difference, while Li4SiO4 presented a limited thermal efficiency. 3.7.2 Thermal efficiency for methanol reforming with and without CO2 absorbents Table 6 presents results for calculations of the thermal efficiency (η) at 600 °C at different S/E ratios. Again, here in this table a temperature of 600 °C was chosen because at this condition most of the systems achieved their maximum hydrogen production and concentrations (see previous sections). Without the use of absorbent the thermal efficiency increased as the S/M ratio also increased from 54% at S/M of 1 (stoichiometric condition) to 67.5% at S/M of 4. A further increase in S/M ratio resulted in a decrease in thermal efficiency to values of 65.5 and 62.9% for S/M ratios of 5 and 6, respectively. These results are in agreement with reported data by He et al. [25] and Lima da Silva and Müller [8]. Therefore an optimal S/M ratio of 4 was employed for comparing the effect for each absorbent based on their thermal efficiency. Table 6 reports the values for the thermal efficiency of the AER of methanol for every CO2 absorbent studied. The use of CaO produced a thermal efficiency of 77.3% at S/M = 4, while an increase in S/M ratio to 5 and 6 reduced significantly its efficiency to values of 72.3 and 67.8%. This means that the amount of steam generated can eventually hurt the efficiency of the system, a lot heat is needed in order provide high S/M ratios greater than 4. Additionally, not only the gaseous species absorb the heat provided by the steam but the solid absorbent absorbs heat too. Nevertheless, the advantage in the use of a CO2 absorbent (CaO) resulted in an increase in thermal efficiency of 9.8%, which represents important energy savings generated by the AER process. The use of calcined dolomite reduced the thermal efficiency 1% with respect to CaO. Therefore, the impact of introducing an inert such as MgO only produced a minor effect over the thermal efficiency. Whereas, the use of the zirconates, Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3, resulted in almost identical values for this system (75.6 and 75.4%, respectively) and only represented a reduction of about 1.7% with respect to CaO. These absorbent systems are promising since their differences with respect to CaO are minor and they present the advantages of being materials with high thermal stability and durability. Finally, from results of Table 6 it can be seen that Li4SiO4 presented a limited thermal efficiency of 72.9%, which agrees well with its performance during the hydrogen production thermodynamic analysis evaluation. Additionally, for both biofuels analyzed (ethanol and methanol), it should be observed that in the AER process the highest efficiencies occur in a limited range of steam-to-fuel ratios (6 for ethanol and 4 for methanol)."
12,Optimal operating conditions for AER process,"3.8 Optimal operating conditions for AER process For both bio-fuels, under the AER system, it can be seen that it is possible to obtain a hydrogen concentration of ≈99% purity at 1 atm, 500 °C and S/M = 4 and 600 °C and S/E = 6. However, in order to achieve a CO concentration below 10 ppm intended for PEMFC applications a temperature around 450 °C is needed, which represents a decrease in hydrogen production as well as in hydrogen purity from the above described conditions. Therefore, a preferential CO oxidation process performed in a COPROX reactor is necessary in order to reduce CO concentration to appropriate levels for PEMFC applications (<10 ppm). Conditions found in the present thermodynamic analysis pointed out that for ethanol reforming S/E = 6 and 500 °C will provide a Y H 2 of 5.5 and a hydrogen concentration as high as 98% with the use of a CO2 absorbent (CaO). Otherwise, for the steam reforming of methanol optimal conditions found were S/M = 6 and 500 °C, which produced a hydrogen concentration of 99.8% using CaO as absorbent. Table 7 presents optimal ethanol and methanol absorption reforming conditions for all the absorbents employed in the present study. For ethanol and methanol absorption a S/E = 6 and a T = 500 °C domain the optimal conditions for all absorbents. Also, it is worth to mention that the thermal efficiency is closely related to the hydrogen concentration in the product gas as well as to the hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) . Therefore, these set of conditions also insure high thermal efficiencies for the AER process."
13,Conclusions,"Thermodynamic analysis of steam reforming of light alcohols (ethanol and methanol) with and without CO2 absorbents were carried out to determine favorable operating conditions to produce a high purity H2 gas product. Results indicate no carbon formation at steam to alcohol ratios less than stoichiometric values (S/fuel ≤ stoichiometric) for the corresponding steam reforming reactions. However, for the ethanol system using CO2 absorbents, carbon free operation can be found at S/E ratios greater than 2.0 and temperatures higher than 958 °C. While, for methanol reforming carbon free operation is achieved at steam/methanol ratios greater than 0.6 and temperatures higher than 778 °C. Generally, carbon formation is suppressed with CO2 absorption compared to conventional reforming operation for ethanol or methanol steam reforming. The use of a CO2 absorbent resulted in an increase in Y H 2 (moles H2/moles alcohol) and H2 purity. This enhancement under the ethanol reforming system produced a 19.2% increase in hydrogen production with respect to the conventional reforming and the hydrogen concentration was increased from 69 to 97%. Otherwise, with the methanol reforming system a 7% increase in hydrogen production was reached, while the hydrogen concentration increased from 73 to 98%. Under optimal operating conditions for AER process it is possible to produce a hydrogen concentration of ≈99% purity at 1 atm, 500 °C and S/M = 6 for ethanol and methanol reforming. For both alcohols CaO and CaO*MgO showed similar results with high levels of hydrogen production ratios and concentrations, Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3 resulted in only slightly lower values than CaO, while Li4SiO4 showed significantly lower values than CaO. The order from higher to lower hydrogen production and concentration based on each CO2 absorbent was as follows: CaO > CaO*MgO > Na2ZrO3 > Li2ZrO3 > Li4SiO4. The thermal efficiency of the conventional reforming and AER systems were found to be strongly related to the hydrogen concentration in the product gas as well as to the hydrogen production yield ( Y H 2 ) . The thermal efficiency was also enhanced with the use of a CO2 absorbent since with the ethanol reforming system an increase from 66 to 81% was found with respect to the conventional process, while in the methanol reforming system the increase was from 67 to 77%. The AER technology represents a promising low-temperature process for high-quality H2 production with low propensity to carbon formation. Furthermore, the use of low temperatures could bring beneficial effects on the life of the catalysts and the construction materials of the reformers as well as in substantial energy savings. Besides these technological aspects, other advantages of the AER are expected, such as easy CO2 sequestration. In this case, the use of alcohols in conjunction with AER could be a potentially viable carbon-negative process. Finally, Na2ZrO3 and Li2ZrO3 can be considered as promising alternate absorbents with comparable thermodynamics to the reference CaO absorbent for alcohol reforming applications in the present work. However, the limited durability of CaO and CaO*MgO absorbents make these zirconate materials ideal absorbents to be used under the AER system. However, from the two zirconates, Na2ZrO3 is the one that presents greater kinetics and superior stability. Therefore, Na2ZrO3 should be considered as a high potential absorbent under the AER of ethanol and/or methanol for future experimental evaluations."
