0,Introduction,"Nitrogen-containing compounds, especially amines, play a pivotal role in the production of solvents, pharmaceutical/agrochemical agents, polymers, and many other value-added products [1–6]. More importantly, it is anticipated that the market for alkylamines will grow steadily in the next few years to meet their increasing consumption [5]. Up to now, several methods have been available to produce amines, depending on the ingredients [4–7]. However, the conventional synthesis of amines via amination of alkyl halides or nitrile hydrogenation is faced with increasingly stringent environment legislation, as these strategies suffer from several drawbacks, including the use of toxic/hazardous reagents and the formation of environmentally unfriendly byproducts [5,7,8]. The amination of carbonyl compounds under mild conditions via reductive amination can be an alternative for amine production [3,4,9], but is limited by its costly H2 consumption [5] and the limited substrate scope [10,11]. Thus, hydrogen-borrowing amination from alcohols over heterogeneous catalysts has attracted increasing attention in the past decade, but only a few works have been reported [5,7,10–22]. Ni-based catalysts are found to have high selectivity in the synthesis of primary amines [10,19]. Co-based catalysts have the ability to obtain primary amines as main products in both liquid and gas phase processes by adjusting the operating conditions [20,21]. An Au/ZrO2 catalyst is available for hydrogen-borrowing amination using organic amines [22]. Pd- and Pt-based catalysts are also efficient in converting mixtures of alcohols and amines to secondary or tertiary amines [13,14,17]. Theoretically, this strategy can avoid the use of extra hydrogen resources, and the only by-product is water, so this hydrogen-borrowing amination route is considered green and sustainable. Compared with Ni-based catalysts, noble-metal-based catalysts can achieve significantly higher catalytic activity in hydrogen-borrowing amination [14]. However, one major challenge in this route is pursuing a high selectivity to primary amines, which are considered to be the most important category of amines for further upgrading [7,10]. Generally, the hydrogen-borrowing amination of alcohols to the corresponding primary amines consists of four individual steps (Scheme 1 ) [23,24]: (a) direct dehydrogenation of alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds; (b) formation of intermediate imines (by reaction between molecular ammonia and produced ketone/aldehyde); (c) hydrogenation of imine intermediates to desired primary amines using H2 produced in the initial step; (d) ammonolysis of Schiff base intermediates (formed from primary amines and carbonyl intermediates, owing to the higher nucleophilicity of primary amines than of ammonia [25]) to the targeted primary amine, or hydrogenation of Schiff base intermediates to secondary amines (called overhydrogenation later), the main byproduct. In addition, the disproportionation of produced primary amines can be another source of secondary amines. Pt-based catalysts are promising catalytic systems used in dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes [26–29], which hints at their potential application in hydrogen-borrowing processes[13]. However, due to the strong hydrogenation capability of the CN bond over Pt particles [30], the selective synthesis of primary amines from the corresponding alcohols using Pt-based catalysts is still challenging. Recent developments in bimetallic catalysis provide efficient strategies for tuning the selectivity/activity of the reaction by electronic or geometric effects between two metal components [31–33]. Another interesting finding published recently is that CeO2 can be one of the most promising supports for hydrogen-borrowing amination [14]. Combining recent achievements, it is desirable to build a high-efficiency bimetallic catalytic system for the synthesis of primary amines via hydrogen-borrowing amination. In this work, we designed a 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst and compared its catalytic performance in hydrogen-borrowing amination of cyclopentanol (which can potentially be obtained via biomass-based routes [34]) to cyclopentanylamine with that over pristine CeO2, 2%Co/CeO2, and 1%Pt/CeO2 catalysts. This reaction is also used as a model to explore the catalytic behavior during the hydrogen-borrowing amination process over these catalysts. The 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst shows a significant promotion effect on both catalytic activity and selectivity to cyclopentanylamine, and the yield to cyclopentanylamine reaches up to 67%. Comprehensive characterization illustrates that the chemical states of surface Pt species are almost identical in both Pt-containing catalysts, while Co species exist as Co(II)O x with part of these species decorating Pt particles. These CoO x species geometrically affect the behavior of Pt in two critical steps (dehydrogenation of alcohol reactant and overhydrogenation of Schiff base intermediate), which eventually leads to distinct performance of the Pt-Co/CeO2 catalyst. This study provides novel concepts for the efficient synthesis of primary amines from alcohols by hydrogen-borrowing amination through the design of a Pt-based bimetallic catalytic system."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ce-based catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of Ce-based catalysts The CeO2 support selected was synthesized by a hydrothermal method [35]. Typically, 2.0 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O is first dissolved in 60 mL anhydrous ethanol in a 100-mL Teflon bottle, and then 1.0 g oxalic acid is added to the Ce solution under vigorous stirring. After the formation of a gel, the mixture is sealed and heated at 160 °C for 12 h. Then a solid is obtained by filtration and washed with ethanol and water. After drying at 110 °C for 12 h, the CeO2 material is obtained by calcination of a dried solid at 500 °C for 3 h. All metal-loaded catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. For monometallic 1%Pt/CeO2 and 2%Co/CeO2, 0.5 g CeO2 is mixed with a 0.025-g metal·mL−1Pt(NO3)2 or Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution to form a slurry, maintained at 30 °C for 12 h, dried at 110 °C for 12 h, and finally calcined at 500 °C for 2 h. A bimetallic 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst is prepared via co-impregnation with a mixed aqueous solution of Pt and Co nitrate salts (0.025 g metal·mL−1); the process is the same as for monometallic catalysts. The loading amounts of metal components over every sample are detected by ICP-AES. Before use, all samples are reduced under 10%H2/Ar for 2 h (300 °C for 1%Pt/CeO2 and 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2; 400 °C for 2%Co/CeO2) and cooled under pure Ar. All reduced catalysts were stored under Ar before further tests."
3,Catalytic performance tests,"2.2 Catalytic performance tests Hydrogen-borrowing amination of cyclopentanol was conducted in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL). After we sealed a p-xylene (5 mL) solution of cyclopentanol (2 mmol) and catalyst (50 mg) into the autoclave, it was purged three times with NH3 gas and then pressurized to 3.5 bar. The stirring rate was set at 600 rpm during the reaction. On reaching the preset time of the test, the reactor was immediately quenched in an ice-water bath. After the reactor was cooled to room temperature (RT), the liquid phase was collected by centrifugation. We used two individual GC/GC–MS systems for product analysis. The quantitative analysis of products was executed on a GC system (Agilent 7890B) equipped with a HP-5 column, while the qualitative analysis was carried out on a GC–MS system (Agilent 7890A-5975C). The conversion and carbon yield of every individual product are calculated using the following method: (1) Conv . % = 1 - n residual,0 n 0 × 100 % (2) Carbon Yield % = N carbon, x · n x N carbon,0 · n 0 × 100 % . Here, N carbon, x means the number of C atoms in molecule x; nx represents the amount of the corresponding product or reactant; and n residual, 0 means the residual amount of cyclopentanol after the reaction."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization To identify both electronic and geometric structures over samples, as well as to investigate detailed structure–property relationships of catalytic systems, we carried out extensive characterizations. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples are recorded on a D8 Focus diffractometer (CuKα radiation). Specific areas of all the samples were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020M sorption analyzer using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. During the measurement, all samples were degassed at 200 °C for 6 h and measured at −196 °C using N2 as the adsorptive. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Pt4f and Co2p 3/2 was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250 Xi system with monochromatic AlKα radiation, and the results were calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. A series of temperature-programmed tests (H2 TPR, NH3 TPD, and CO2 TPD) and CO-pulse adsorption were carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 system; 0.1 g of catalyst was used each time in these tests. In the CO2 TPD and NH3 TPD tests, all samples were first swept under He for 1 h before the adsorption step. For metal-loaded samples, the samples were further reduced under 5%H2/Ar for an extra hour at 300 °C and swept under He for 30 min at the same temperature before cooling down. The adsorption step was carried out at 50 and 80 °C, respectively, for 1 h and then the samples were swept under He for an extra hour before desorption. All the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) experiments were performed on a Nicolet Model iS-50 FT-IR system with an MCT/A detector (4 cm−1 resolution and 32 scans), and the sample cell was fitted with ZnSe windows. In the in situ CO-adsorption DRIFT tests, the sample was prereduced in the chamber by 5%H2/Ar at a preset temperature for 1 h (cooled to 30 °C under Ar), and then 1%CO/Ar was introduced into the chamber at 30 °C for 30 min. After the sample was swept under Ar for another 30 min, tits spectrum was recorded. During the in situ 2-propanol (2-POL) probed DRIFT tests, metal-loaded catalysts were pretreated under 5%H2/Ar for 1 h at a desired temperature and cooled to 30 °C under Ar atmosphere. Pristine CeO2 catalyst was pretreated under Ar at 300 °C for 1 h. 2-POL (dried by a 4A molecular sieve at RT overnight) was bubbled into the chamber by Ar (30 mL·min−1) at 30 °C for 30 min, and the spectra were recorded after the chamber was swept under Ar for 10 min. X-ray adsorption fine structure measurements (XAFS) were conducted at beamline 44A of the Taiwan Photon Source. XAFS measurements were conducted for the Pt L 3-edge and the Co K-edge in fluorescent mode. The Co K-edge spectra were obtained under hydrogen atmosphere (10% H2 and 90% He) at RT. The in situ treatment condition is to heat the sample of 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 to 300 °C for 2 h under hydrogen followed by XAS measurement at RT. The XAFS analysis was performed using Athena software."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Basic characterization of CeO2 support and metal-loaded catalysts,"3.1 Basic characterization of CeO2 support and metal-loaded catalysts First, pristine CeO2 and all three metal-loaded M/CeO2 catalysts (1%Pt/CeO2, 2%Co/CeO2 and 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2) were prepared, and the metal content in catalysts was confirmed by ICP-AES to be in agreement with the desired loading (Table 1 ). The XRD patterns of pristine and metal-loaded CeO2 catalysts in Fig. 1 show the features of a typical cubic fluoride CeO2 structure; meanwhile, no diffraction peaks of metal phases [36] and/or CoO x -related phases [37] are found in these metal-loaded catalysts, possibly due to the high dispersion of metal nanoparticles or the low metal content. The surface area of these catalysts was also measured and collected in Table 1, and no remarkable differences were found among these samples (50–60 m2·g−1). HR-TEM images of pristine CeO2 and metal-loaded catalysts (Fig. 2 ) were recorded as well. The morphology of the CeO2 support does not show significant changes after impregnation with metal components; moreover, the Pt species (based on the metal contrast) observed on the CeO2 support are in the form of extremely small particles, as all the observed Pt particles identified are beneath 2 nm (Fig. 2C and D). This observation of small metal particles is in line with the XRD results. However, we cannot recognize Co species in the bimetallic sample, due to the low contrast of Co species over CeO2 support. The absence of Co observation in HR-TEM image also implies high codispersion under lower loading. According to the low-temperature CO-pulse adsorption tests (Table 1), the 1%Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows a high adsorption of 39.1 μmol/g, which also indicates high dispersion of Pt species over this catalyst. The adsorption over the bimetallic PtCo/CeO2 catalyst declines to 32.4 μmol/g and is still a bit higher than that over the 2%Co/CeO2 catalyst (29.6 μmol/g)."
7,Catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in the hydrogen-borrowing amination of cyclopentanol to cyclopentanylamine,"3.2 Catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in the hydrogen-borrowing amination of cyclopentanol to cyclopentanylamine After obtaining the physical properties of these four catalysts, we compared their catalytic performance in hydrogen-borrowing amination of cyclopentanol (Table 2 ). As expected, pristine CeO2 cannot convert cyclopentanol under the investigated conditions (0.35 MPa NH3, 160 °C) because metal species are believed to play a critical role in the initial dehydrogenation step in the hydrogen-borrowing reaction [12]. 1%Pt/CeO2 shows the capability of converting cyclopentanol to amines, but unfortunately the secondary amine (4) is the main product (yield 48%), instead of the targeted cyclopentanylamine. When Co species are co-impregnated with Pt as a second metal component, both activity and yield of cyclopentanylamine (up to 67%) are profoundly promoted (Table 2 and Fig. 3 ). In addition, a small amount of aldol-condensed products (below 10%) was detected over these two Pt-containing catalysts, which may be due to the existence of acid/base sites (see below). Surprisingly, the 2%Co/CeO2 catalyst shows hardly any activity in the hydrogen-borrowing process, implying that Pt sites are essential in the process and Co species may act as a promoter over this bimetallic PtCo/CeO2 catalyst. Further comparison of the time courses illustrates the higher activity of the bimetallic PtCo/CeO2 system and meanwhile shows that the reaction pathways over these two Pt-loaded catalysts are almost the same, except for their different abilities for ammonolysis and overhydrogenation of the Schiff base intermediate (3). The PtCo/CeO2 catalyst shows performance in hydrogen-borrowing amination to cyclopentanylamine superior to that over Pt/CeO2. Such diverse catalytic performance between these two catalysts raises a question: what happens after the introduction of Co species? In the following sections, we are going to make a comprehensive discussion on this issue."
8,Comparison of the independent dehydrogenation of cyclopentanol and hydrogenation of Schiff base intermediates,"3.3 Comparison of the independent dehydrogenation of cyclopentanol and hydrogenation of Schiff base intermediates To understand the diverse results of product distribution over two Pt-loaded catalysts, it is essential to analyze the reaction progress first (Scheme 2 ). At the very beginning of the reaction, cyclopentanol (0) is dehydrogenated into cyclopentanone (1) and a stoichiometric H2 molecule, which acts as a “trigger” of the whole process. This is usually believed to be the rate-determining step in the overall reaction, and needs the participation of metal catalysts [19,20]. Then the noncatalytic reaction between cyclopentanone and NH3 occurs spontaneously before reaching the chemical balance (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). After the formation of the imine intermediate (5), it can be turned rapidly into cyclopentanylamine over a hydrogenation catalyst. At the same time, part of the produced cyclopentanylamine can spontaneously react with the cyclopentanone intermediate to form a Schiff base intermediate (3), because of the higher nucleophilicity of primary amines than that of ammonia. When the progress comes to the conversion of the Schiff base intermediate (3), two pathways coexist: Schiff-base (3) can be irreversibly hydrogenated into a secondary amine (4, the main by-product in this work) over metallic catalysts, or undergo an ammonolysis reaction and a subsequent hydrogenation step to obtain two cyclopentanylamine molecules. Over these two Pt(Co)/CeO2 catalysts, the disproportionation of cyclopentanylamine to secondary amine 4 is not preferred, considering the results shown in Fig. S1. Based on analysis of reaction pathways, we decided to focus on the two critical catalytic steps, alcohol dehydrogenation and Schiff base hydrogenation, in the following investigation. The cyclopentanol dehydrogenation investigations were carried out under inert atmosphere over all four catalysts, and the results are summarized in Table 3 . Obviously, only reduced Pt-loaded catalysts show activity in this step; moreover, Co species over the bimetallic catalyst promote the catalytic activity of cyclopentanol dehydrogenation more than 1%Pt/CeO2. This result illustrates that reduced Pt species are necessary for the dehydrogenation of cyclopentanol, and synergetic effects exist between Pt and Co species. More importantly, this observation explains the acceleration of the overall reaction rate over 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2, as dehydrogenation is considered the rate-determining step in the whole process. Schiff-base intermediate (3) was successfully synthesized (92% yield) after a series of reaction conditions were tried (Table S1), and was used as a substrate to investigate the hydrogenation activity of various catalysts. Controlled experiments (Table 4 ) showed that 1%Pt/CeO2 possesses the highest activity (with 61.2% conversion) for hydrogenation of CN bonds in Schiff bases, much higher than that over 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 (only 11.5% conversion), whereas pristine CeO2 and 2%Co/CeO2 cannot hydrogenate the CN bond at all (Table 4). Undoubtedly, this result points out that Co species have the capability to strongly suppress the hydrogenation ability of Pt sites in the Pt–Co/CeO2 catalytic system. In summary, our comparative investigations of two critical catalytic steps indicate that the superior properties of bimetallic 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst are derived from synergetic effects between Pt and Co species, which exhibit opposite influences upon these two individual steps and finally promote activity and selectivity for primary amines."
9,Characterization of surface chemical states of metal components,"3.4 Characterization of surface chemical states of metal components To understand the essence of this remarkable promotion effect of Co species in hydrogen-borrowing amination of cyclopentanol over the PtCo/CeO2 catalyst, we further investigate the surface properties of these catalysts. H2 TPR profiles of metal-loaded CeO2 catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 . In the profile of 1%Pt/CeO2 catalyst, one Pt reduction peak appears at 80 °C; meanwhile, the peaks over 400 °C are closely related to the reduction of the CeO2 support. Differently, the reduction peak of Pt species over 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 shifts significantly to 140 °C with a shoulder at 220 °C. The H2 consumption of the Pt reduction peak over this Pt–Co sample is significantly larger, due to the hydrogen spillover effect [29]. In the case of 2%Co/CeO2, other than features related to the reduction of CeO2 substrate (over 400 °C), three reduction peaks of Co species can be observed in the range 200–400 °C. The peak at ca. 232 °C can be attributed to the reduction of surface Co3O4 to CoO, while the direct reduction of Co3O4 to metallic Co is at around 294 °C. The reduction of residual CoO species to Co takes place at a higher temperature (above 300 °C) [38]. These results suggest that the shoulder at 220 °C in the case of Pt–Co catalyst is related to the formation of surface CoO-like species. In addition, the shift of the Pt reduction peak to higher temperature indicates the strong interaction between Pt and Co species. Then we collected the XPS spectra of both mono- and bimetallic catalysts, including Pt4f and Co2p signals, to identify the surface composition and states of these samples (Fig. 5 ). Pt chemical states over both catalysts show high similarity. Namely, besides some surface Pt2+ species, a majority of Pt has been reduced to Ptδ+ (4f 7/2 at 71.7 eV) and the ratios of Pt2+ to Ptδ+ are almost identical over these two catalysts (Pt2+/Ptδ+ ≈ 0.74). Pt L 3-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 5A) also show that the Pt chemical states over these two catalysts are similar before and after reduction treatment. Nevertheless, the Pt chemical states over reduced catalysts are remarkably lower than those over unreduced samples, but still higher than that of Pt foil (Fig. 6 A). The reduced Pt states suggest there is charge transfer between Pt and the CeO2 support, which is common in this type of catalytic system [28,29,39,40], owing to the electronic metal–support interaction (EMSI) effect [39–41]. This EMSI effect is evaluated to reach maximum at Pt particle sizes between 1 and 1.5 nm [39], which is consistent with our TEM observation. In addition, according to our previous work [29], this XPS results of Pt indicate the existence of Pt–O–M n + (M = Ce or Co) interfacial structure. Meanwhile, the Co2p 3/2 XPS spectrum of 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 indicates that Co species in the reduced sample are in the forms of CoO-like species (780.0 eV) and Co(OH)2 (781.3 eV)[42]; no evidence of metallic Co(0) or Co(III) species is found. Moreover, a satellite peak at 785.7 eV further shows that Co(II) species should be the composition of this reduced bimetallic PtCo catalyst [43]. In the H2 TPR profile of the 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 sample, no peaks related to the formation of Co(0) can be observed, suggesting that Co species can only be reduced to Co(II) under the investigated reduction conditions (300 °C, 2 h, 30 mL/min 5%H2/Ar). Generally, a higher “white line” in the XANES spectrum could be observed for metals in higher oxidation states [29]. Thus, the in situ Co K-edge XANES in Fig. 6B further confirm that the Co species over the 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst can only be partially reduced under 300 °C. Up to now, we illustrate that the Pt chemical states are identical over these two catalysts, although CoO x species strongly affected the redox properties of loaded Pt species over PtCo/CeO2 catalysts. Therefore, the electronic effect between Pt and CoO x may not be the main origin of the promotional effect in the amination of cyclopentanol over PtCo/CeO2 catalyst."
10,Geometric features of CoO x species in a 1%P–1%Co/CeO2 catalytic system,"3.5 Geometric features of CoO x species in a 1%P–1%Co/CeO2 catalytic system In situ CO-adsorption DRIFT spectra not only characterize the electronic states of surface metal species [44], but also reveal some geometric information on loaded metal particles [45,46]. We thus collected the spectra of all metal-loaded samples (Fig. 7 ) and found no distinguishable signal of CO adsorption (in the range 1800–2200 cm−1) on 2%Co/CeO2, probably due to the insignificant reduction of Co species during H2 pretreatment. Two strong peaks, centered at 2094 and 2076 cm−1, are observed over 1%Pt/CeO2, which indicates the existence of at least two categories of Pt species over the monometallic catalyst. According to previous reports [33,45,46], the peak at lower wavenumber (2076 cm−1) can be assigned to some low-coordinated Pt sites (kinks, steps, corners, etc.), while the other peak (2094 cm−1) is attributed to high-coordinated Pt sites such as terraces. Interestingly, the feature at low wavenumber vanishes in the bimetallic system, and only an intense peak at 2090 cm−1 remains in this case. This phenomenon suggests that the low-coordinated Pt sites are covered with Co species after co-impregnation. Low-temperature (−50 °C) CO pulse adsorption results mentioned before also support this Co species coverage behavior, as CO adsorption decreases from 39 μmmol·g−1 over 1%Pt/CeO2 to 32 mmol·g−1 over 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 (Table 1). Combining the electronic and geometric characterizations of 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2, we can visualize its microstructure (Scheme 3 ): CoO x species, as well as Pt species, are well spread over the CeO2 support with part of the CoOx species blocking the low-coordinated Pt sites."
11,Dual functional roles of CoO x over a 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst in hydrogen-borrowing amination,"3.6 Dual functional roles of CoO x over a 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst in hydrogen-borrowing amination We find that such a Co(II)O x geometric structure over 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 does have a strong impact on the two pivotal catalytic steps (dehydrogenation and hydrogenation), which is beneficial for the overall reaction. Here, we are going to further illustrate and discuss the pivotal structure–function roles of these CoO x species in the reaction. The CoO x covering model of the bimetallic catalyst (Scheme 2) can easily be applied to explain the inhibition effect on CN hydrogenation step over the 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst. Generally, reduced Pt species are active sites for H2 activation; moreover, low-coordinated Pt sites are believed to have higher H2 activation activity. Since CoO x species block some of these active sites, it is not surprising to see such significant suppression in the conversion of a Schiff base (3) to a secondary amine (4). Thus, one of the roles of CoO x in the PtCo system is its geometric effect in eliminating Pt sites that are “too” active in CN hydrogenation and lead to the formation of by-product (4). However, the blocking effect of CoO x species is not enough to explain the enhancement of the initial cyclopentanol dehydrogenation step. To further explore the role of Co species in this step, we consider the structure of active sites for alcohol dehydrogenation. The obviously opposite effects on these two individual steps imply that the composition of the active site structure in the dehydrogenation step cannot be established on pure Pt sites only, and CoO x /CeO x species may participate in the construction of dehydrogenation centers with reduced Pt species. Recent reports of alcohol dehydrogenation and hydrogen-borrowing amination suggest that the activation of alcohol over metal–metal oxide systems is highly related to the M1–O–M2 n + interface (here, M1 and M2 represent two different metal components) and the adjacent Lewis acid–base pairs on supports [19,47–52]. During alcohol dehydrogenation, the hydroxyl group of alcohols is first activated by the acid–base pairs aside from the metal species; then the α-H is abstracted over metal sites; and the recoupling of two abstracted H finally takes place over the metal surface [50–52]. Following these concepts in direct dehydrogenation of alcohol, we used 2-propanol (2-POL) as a probe molecule to investigate the surface process in the dehydrogenation step over these catalysts by in situ DRIFT spectroscopy (Fig. 8 ). For Pt-free samples, three peaks (1655, 1565, and 1557 cm−1) are observed after adsorption of 2-POL over samples in the range 1700–1550 cm−1, which can be identified as IR features of CO adsorbed on Lewis-acid (L-acid) sites (1655 and 1565 cm−1) and conjugated CC bonds in acetone self-condensed products (data in Table S2) [53,54]. As has been deeply investigated, alcohols first undergo dissociative adsorption over Lewis acid–base pairs (evidence is found at 1050 and 1130 cm−1 in all spectra) [50,51], and then subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation with lattice oxygen or surface hydroxyl groups (see Fig. S2) [54,55]. However, a new band at ca. 1700 cm−1 appears in spectra of either 1%Pt/CeO2 or 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2, which can be assigned to the CO bond of acetone adsorbed on L-acid sites (Ce4+/Ce3+ or Co2+) [53]. Notably, when acetone is introduced onto a pristine CeO2 sample, this band can still be seen at 1699 cm−1, besides physically adsorbed acetone at 1715 cm−1 and the features of condensed species (Fig. 9 ). This observation shows that chemisorbed acetone is not directly bonded to Pt species. Interestingly, this band only appears in the cases of Pt-containing samples, which suggests that these CO → L species are highly likely to be associated with Pt species, with Pt species taking part in the acetone formation process. Thus, Pt species and their adjacent Lewis acid–base pairs together are the active sites for alcohol dehydrogenation, which means that cyclopentanol dehydrogenation follows an interfacial mechanism [19,47] over Pt/CeO2 and CoO x -decorated Pt/CeO2 catalysts. The CO2 TPD and NH3 TPD data (Fig. 10 and Table S3) of pristine CeO2 and in situ reduced Pt(Co)/CeO2 catalysts further illustrate that the decoration of CoO species on Pt/CeO2 increases both surface acid and base amounts, which is beneficial for the activation of alcohols and can eventually accelerate the dehydrogenation step [50–52]. These findings can explain the enhancement of Co additives by forming additional Pt–CoO x interfaces. Based on this evidence and previous reports, we propose a mechanism for cyclopentanol dehydrogenation over this PtCo/CeO2 catalyst (Scheme 4 ). Cyclopentanol is initially chemisorbed via dissociative adsorption on Co2+–O2− or Ce n +–O2− Lewis acid–base pairs alongside Pt species; then the dissociated H species anti-spillover back to the surface of Pt particles, and finally combine with abstracted α-H species to form H2 molecules over Pt particles, which supply hydrogen for following steps. In addition, the Pt–CoO x interfaces provide some sites with higher activity for this step than those on the original Pt–CeO2 interfaces. So far, we can see that Co(II) species play completely different roles in two of the most critical steps at the base of the geometric effects of CoO x species, which determine the exceptional performance: better activity and overwhelmingly higher selectivity to cyclopentanylamine over the PtCo/CeO2 catalyst. More importantly, we further confirm that these findings can easily be applied to the synthesis of primary amines from other alcohols, including primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, and benzyl alcohol (Table 5 ). The selectivity to primary amines from investigated substrates improves profoundly with Co-decorated Pt/CeO2 catalyst; the selectivity to benzylamine from benzyl alcohol reaches as high as 92% at a conversion of 59.8%."
12,Conclusions,"In this study, we find that the 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst possesses both higher activity and higher cyclopentanylamine selectivity in hydrogen-borrowing amination of cyclopentanol than those of the 1%Pt/CeO2 catalyst. The in-depth investigation of two critical catalytic steps (alcohol dehydrogenation and overhydrogenation of the Schiff base intermediate) illustrates that the introduction of Co species promotes the dehydrogenation step efficiently and suppresses the overhydrogenation of the Schiff base to the undesired secondary amine (by-product). These two positive effects of CoO x species in the Pt–Co system determine its superior performance in the one-pot synthesis of primary amines from alcohols. The chemical states and geometric information of Pt and Co species over 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 catalyst are clearly recognized: the surface states of reduced Pt species in both of the Pt-containing catalysts are almost identical, and partially positively charged; moreover, the Co species over the PtCo/CeO2 catalyst are in the form of Co(II). The specific geometric structure of CoO x over 1%Pt–1%Co/CeO2 plays dual functions in the overall process, which is of principal importance in tuning the catalytic performance of Pt–CeO2-based catalysts. In detail, these Co(II)O x decorations block part of the highly active Pt sites (low-coordination ones) for overhydrogenation of the Schiff base intermediate to suppress the yield of the secondary amine by-product, while these CoO x species create highly active interfaces with Pt sites for alcohol dehydrogenation, thus accelerating the rate-determining step. This research provides a practical methodology for modification/design of Pt-based catalysts for alcohol hydrogen-borrowing amination; also, detailed concepts from the structure–properties relationship are proposed on the foundation of extended characterizations, which brightens the future of the efficient synthesis of primary amines using Pt-based catalysts."
