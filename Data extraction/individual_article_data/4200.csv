0,Introduction,"The conversion of solar energy into hydrogen, a potential candidate for clean and sustainable fuel in future, offers an attractive and effective way to solve the increasingly urgent energy crisis [1–4]. Given the high photoactivity and chemical inertness, TiO2 has been extensively used as an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting since its first utilization on photoelectrochemical (PEC) electrodes [5,6]. However, the poor light absorption and rapid electron/hole (e/h+) recombination, greatly restrict the efficiency of TiO2. Thus, some attempts have been made to reduce the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and to improve its utilization of solar light for photocatalysis, by decorating the photocatalysts with carrier scavenging agents such as noble metals (e.g. Au, Ag), metal oxides with narrower bandgaps and organic molecules [7–10]. Especially, functional metal-free carbonaceous materials as sensitizers have been a hot topic, because of their wide visible light absorption at the wavelength of 400–800 nm and high absorption capacity, facilitating the surficial reaction of photocatalysis [11–13]. In particular, it has been successfully demonstrated by different groups, including ours, that growing a carbon layer on the surface of metal oxides improves their photocatalytic properties [14–20]. Also, the delocalized conjugated π structure of carbon could act as both electron acceptors and donors, favoring the effective electron transportation. On the other hand, how to further enhance the separation rates of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is another challenge to improve the photocatalytic activities. Inspired by the basic structure of solar cell device and the electron reservoir properties of carbon, it is feasible to construct another route to capture or remove the photo-induced holes efficiently. Very recently, the construction of artificial Z-scheme photocatalytic system has became an ideal and effective solution because it not only can capture photo-induced holes reducing the electron-hole recombination, but also preserves excellent redox ability. However, the majority of the synthesized artificial Z-scheme photocatalytic systems usually had redox pair (Fe3+/Fe2+, IO3−/I−) in solution, which would bring about great difficulties in their practical applications [21,22]. Therefore, it is necessary to design and construct solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system by introducing novel semiconductor with matchable bandgap and conduction band (CB) potential. Tungsten oxide (WO3), as an n-type semiconductor, is a typical narrow band gap (∼2.7 eV) semiconductor, which could be a good candidate for capturing visible light [23–28]. However, its utilization in H2 evolution is limited due to its low CB. WO3 has suitable band edges (ECB = 0.74 eV, EVB = 3.4 eV), which can match well with TiO2 (ECB = −0.5 eV, EVB = 2.7 eV) to form a direct solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system. In such a case, the photoexcited electrons in CB of TiO2 would show strong reducibility and the photoexcited holes on valence band (VB) of WO3 would exhibit strong oxidizability, respectively. Based on the above considerations, constructing an artificial multi-component photosynthetic system composed of TiO2, WO3 and carbon provides a significant strategy to solve the problem of low light-harvesting efficiency and low quantum yield of TiO2, thus leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance. The enhanced photocatalytic activity might be attributed to the high photon absorption efficiency of visible light by carbon and WO3. More importantly, the special tri-component photosynthetic system with the carbon layer on the surface of TiO2 as an electron collector and WO3 as a hole collector based on Z-scheme has good inhibition of electron-hole recombination. The separated cocatalysts facilitate the separation and migration of photo-excited charges toward two different components, thereby decreasing recombination as well as the reverse reaction. Herein, the fabrication of carbon-coated TiO2/WO3 nanofibers by combining the single capillary electrospinning technique and hydrothermal method was reported. The investigation of photocatalytic ability indicated that the as-prepared nanocomposites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H2-evolution rates under solar-light irradiation, which might be attributed to the high light-harvesting efficiency and high quantum yield based on the photosynergistic effect among the three components of TiO2, WO3 and carbon. Furthermore, free-standing sheets composed of nanofibers were readily delivered using the current processing routes, which enabled cyclic utilization of the materials as potent environmental catalysts [14–17,29]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Fabrication of TiO2/WO3 nanofibers (WT),"2.1 Fabrication of TiO2/WO3 nanofibers (WT) TiO2/WO3 nanofibers were prepared by electrostatic spinning technique. Typically, 0.225 g polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 130000000) and 0.5 g tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) (Aladdin, CP, 98.0%) were added into 2 ml ethyl alcohol (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, 99.7%) and 1.8 ml acetic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, 99.5%) followed by different amount of ammonium tungstate (Aldrich, 99.95%) which were mixed by magnetic stirring for 12 h. The amount of tungsten incorporated ranged from 0.5, 1.0 to 1.5 at.%. Subsequently, the above precursor solutions were drawn into a hypodermic syringe. The positive terminal of a variable high voltage power supply was connected to the needle tip of the syringe while the other terminal was connected to the collector plate (aluminum foil). The distance between the needle tip and collector was ∼15 cm, and the voltage was set at 10–15 kV. The as-collected nanofibers were calcined at a heating rate of 5 deg/h and remained for 0.5 h at 520 °C to form TiO2/WO3 NFs."
3,Preparation of carbon-coated TiO2/WO3 nanofibers (WTC),"2.2 Preparation of carbon-coated TiO2/WO3 nanofibers (WTC) In a typical experiment, WTC NFs were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Glucose (0.45 g) and WT NFs (20 mg) were put into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 50 ml capacity containing 30 mL deionized water to make glucose solution with the concentration of 15 g/L. After being mixed by magnetic stirring for 10 min, the hydrothermal autoclave was kept in an electric stove at 150 °C for 4 h. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled naturally in air, and the suspensions were isolated by filtration, washed with deionized water for several times and dried in oven at 70 °C."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The morphology of the samples was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7500 F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20). Energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) was detected on EDAX TEAM. The crystallization and the phase transition were studied by XRD (Rigaku Ultima IV) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength = 0.15406 nm) from 20° to 80° at a scanning rate of 4°/min. The X-ray tube voltage and current were set at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Resonant Raman spectra were performed on a Jobin-Yvon HR800 micro-Raman spectrometer using the 532 nm line of a He–Cd laser as the excitation source at room temperature. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all samples were detected with a Jobin Yvon HR800 micro-Raman spectrometer using a 325 nm line laser. The diffuse reflectance spectra of all samples were recorded on a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, model UV 3600) equipped with an integrating sphere in the range of 200–800 nm and standard BaSO4 powder was used as a reference. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the samples were performed on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Ltd. England) with Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation as the source."
5,Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production evaluation,"2.4 Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production evaluation Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production was proceed on an online hydrogen analysis system (LabSolar-III AG, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd.) directly connected with gas chromatography (GC-7860). A 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd) was used as the light source. 0.02 g as-prepared sample was mixed with 45 ml deionized water and 25 ml methyl alcohol (anhydrous, Sinopharm Chemical Regent, 99.5%) under strong magnetic stirring for sufficient mixing. The advantage of online analysis system for hydrogen production is that we could test the amount of H2 by real-time monitoring and the generated gas was pumped to gas chromatography every 1 h to get the in situ average hydrogen production rate."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a quartz cubic urn with a conventional three-electrode process on an electrochemical workstation (AMETEK, PARSTAT 4000, America). The as-synthetic photoanode was the working electrode, while a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrode served as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was a 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The photoanode surface has an illuminated area of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2. All the samples (0.1 g) mixing with polyethylene glycol (0.05 g) and water (0.35 ml) were coated on FTO conducting glass, protected by thin transparent cover glass to avoid peeling off of samples. The light source was a 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd, PLS-SXE-300) with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The photocurrent response spectroscopy was recorded at a constant potential of +0.9 V to the working photoanode. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at an open-circuit voltage. A sinusoidal ac perturbation of 5 mV was applied to the electrode over the frequency range of 100 mHz to 10 kHz. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The spectra of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the samples was test using a power source (Newport 300Wxenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone260) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,The morphology of the as-prepared composite nanofibers,"3.1 The morphology of the as-prepared composite nanofibers Fig. 1 A showed the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of 1% WTC for representation. It could be seen that the 3D network structure is composed of uniform and straight nanofibers, and the length of these randomly oriented nanofibers could reach up to several micrometers or more. From the enlarged image of inset in panel A, the diameter of those nanofibers ranged from 350 to 450 nm. Moreover, the surface is quite smooth (Fig. 1B). To further observe its microstructure, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations were carried out and shown in Fig. 1B, C and D. The thickness of that carbon layer was about 10 nm and the carbon layer looked like a shell, covering the TiO2 core. More importantly, their contact was quite close. A clear boundary can be observed from the TEM image because of their different contrast in TEM image. The inset in Fig. 1C demonstrates a local HRTEM image of one matrix region. Three lattice spacings 0.352 nm, 0.35 nm and 0.445 nm correspond to (101), (−101) and (001) planes of anatase TiO2. Three angles formed by each two planes were 137°, 68.2° and 67.8°, respectively. The dominant growth of anatase TiO2 was confirmed [30]. Another set of the fringes spacing ca. 0.182 nm corresponded to the (002) lattice spacing of tungsten trioxide, which was dispersive in TiO2 matrix. An elemental mapping was obtained under a STEM model, which showed that C, O, Ti and W were uniformly distributed throughout the sample (see Fig. 2 ). We could clearly see the C element mainly distributed on the surface of nanofiber within 10 nm in thickness. From STEM EDS, we obtained a relative content of the four elements: 16% C, 12% O, 69% Ti and 2% W, in weight percentage. Also, the element content results of the same sample was given in Fig. s1. Table 1 shows the compositions of 1% WTC by STEM-EDS elemental quantification. We considered all the elements' KAB factor and net intensity error to give a relatively convincing quality ratio and atomic ratio for different elements."
9,X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns,"3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns To process the X-ray diffraction (XRD) test, all samples were dispersed and tabletted onto a 0.2 mm glass sample holder. The standard powder diffraction patterns of anatase TiO2 (ICSD: 01-070-7348) and tungsten trioxide WO3 (ICSD: 00-001-0486) were used as references and shown in the lower panels in Fig. s2. It displayed well structured diffraction pattern from anatase TiO2 phase, which was in good agreement with the reference pattern, and all the samples exhibited two sharp peaks at 25.3° and 48.4° in very good agreement with previous reports [31]. The diffraction peaks of WO3 crystallites were weak and the relative intensity of crystal planes increased slightly with tungsten concentration. A fact that should been noted from the XRD peak intensity was that the actual content of WO3 was slightly higher than nominal content (0.5%, 1% and 1.5%). Especially, there is no XRD signal from carbon shell. The chemical state of carbon in the shell layer was characterized by a Raman spectroscopy."
10,Raman spectra,"3.3 Raman spectra Raman spectroscopy, a powerful and more surface-sensitive technique than XRD, was applied for the investigation of carbon layer. We enlarged typical Raman spectra in the 1325-1650 cm−1 range which included 1582 cm−1 and 1360 cm−1 peaks (see Fig. 3 , and the full spectrum in Fig. s3). As it is known to us, three dimensional single crystal graphite belongs to D6h space symmetric point group; In the irreducible representation of the brillouin zone dot center optical model, double degenerate mode E2g was activated by Raman, and one of the main Raman shift was in 1582 cm−1, generally known as G mode. For disordered carbon structure, there was another first-order Raman shift which was a result of hexagon brillouin zone boundary exactly. The peak position is located at 1360 cm−1, and was caused by the disorder structural, often is referred as D mode. Through previous reports [32–35], we have known that the structural changes in the carbon materials will result in the frequency, intensity and line width change in the G and D mode. The ratio of D and G band intensity is correlated to the in-plane domain size, which is often used to estimate the degree of disorder in the graphite. The reciprocal of Id/Ig was regarded as the degree of graphitization. (1) L a = b I d / I g “La” is crystallite size; “b” is a constant, which is related to the Raman excitation wavelength; the value of La reflects the graphitization degree of carbon layer. The dependence of La on the tungsten element addition is shown in Fig. 3. The addition of WO3 evidently promotes the graphitization of carbon layer. In the graphitization process, turbostratic structure transform to the relatively orderly graphite crystal structure. In our observation, the four WTC samples showed obvious D band and G band peak position. Apparently, 1.5% WTC showed highest graphitization degree, then 1% WTC >0.5% WTC > TC. One possible explanation is that some transition metal elements promoted the ordering process. After structure ordering, graphite has a smaller layer spacing and lower structural electron scattering [36], which will benefit to electron transport along their surface and enhancement in photocatalytic activity."
11,XPS spectra,"3.4 XPS spectra Fig. 4 A presents a full range XPS spectrum of the as-synthesized WTC sample. The XPS survey spectrum indicated that the distinctive and Auger peaks of W, C, O and Ti in the material, which confirmed the presence of these elements and no other peaks of any impurity or byproduct was found. The XPS result was also in good agreement with the EDS mapping and XRD analysis. The high resolution XPS spectrum of C1s around 285 eV is shown in Fig. 4B. The peak with binding energy at 284.4 eV was attributed to the accumulation of graphite carbon. The peak at 285.1 eV was mainly from the extensively delocalized alternate nitrous [37]. Moreover, the two peaks at 286 and 288.8 eV were characteristic of the oxygen bound species C–O and CO, respectively. The presence of these species was attributed to surface adsorption in wet chemistry environment due to the high adsorption capacity of graphite carbon. Fig. 4C depicted the spin–orbit splitting of W4f. It can be deconvoluted into a doublet with binding energy at 35.5 eV and 37.6 eV, resulting from the emission of W4f 7/2 and W4f 5/2 core-levels that belongs to the 6+ oxidation state of tungsten atoms. The deconvoluted binding energy at 35.5 eV and 37.6 eV (W6+) was in good agreement with previous results [38]. Subsequently, the Ti2p high resolution XPS spectra are analyzed in Fig. 4D. Two peaks located at 458.6 and 464.5 eV well corresponded with Ti2p 3/2 and Ti2p 1/2 binding energy, respectively. The splitting of the 2p doublet was 5.8 eV, indicating a normal state of Ti4+ in the 1% WTC. With respect to XPS spectra of O 1s in Fig. 4E, the O 1s signal was well fitted with three contributions. The three peaks at 530.3, 531.5 and 533.2 eV should be ascribed to Ti–O–Ti (lattice O), surface hydroxyl groups (O–H), and adsorbed O2 species, respectively. All of these XPS results and other characterizations gave the insight that the WTC was composed of TiO2, carbon and WO3. Especially, the carbon layer was in a highly ordered state and the addition of W element could further improve the sp2 and sp3 hybridization in carboatomicring."
12,UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra,"3.5 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of all the as-synthetic samples are shown in Fig. 5 A. We particularly intercepted the visible light region within 400–700 nm, and quantized the visible light region absorption to highlight its enhancement in photo-harvesting property after compositing with tungsten and carbon coating (the normalized whole spectra in 200–800 nm is shown in Fig. s4). As observed, the diffuse reflectance spectrum of pure TNFs only exhibited the fundamental absorption band in the UV region (Fig. s4), and no evident absorption in visible wavelengths was observed as shown in Fig. 5A and B. Notably, the curves of WT samples showed slight enhancement of light absorption at a wavelength of 400–700 nm while WTC's were quite significant. Further, the absorbance was enhanced in sequence from 0.5% to 1.5% with the increase of tungsten content. Due to their wide band gaps (Eg) (2.7 eV for WO3 and 3.2 eV for TiO2), both WO3 and TiO2 mainly function under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. However, it is revealed that the absorption of the TiO2/WO3 composite can be extended to the visible (Vis) region as a result of the special photo- or electro-chromic property of WO3 [39], which made us to have a try to add a small quantity of tungsten for synergy enhancement light absorption with carbon. For WTC samples, the strong absorption of visible light could be attributed to synergistic effect of carbon layer and heterojunction. Carbon itself could absorb visible light and joint multichannel system formed between metal oxide and carbon which gave rise in synergistic properties."
13,Photocatalytic activity,"3.6 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activities of the as-synthetic samples were estimated by detecting the photocurrents and evaluated by photocatalytic hydrogen production. Photocurrents were measured with 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution as electrolyte and gives an apparent response to light on/off for TNFs, 1% WT, TC and 1% WTC electrodes under full spectrum light and visible light, respectively (Fig. 6 A and B). It was clear that fast and uniform photocurrent responses were observed in four electrodes, and the photoresponsive phenomenon was entirely reversible. Under full spectrum light irradiation, the photocurrent of the 1% WTC electrode was about 5–6 times as high as that of the TNFs (Fig. 6A) owing to the enhanced light absorption, efficient electron transfer and charge separation in the core/shell WTC composites. Under visible light irradiation, TNFs' photocurrent response was negligible. On the contrary, 1% WTC photocatalyst showed a noticeable photocurrent intensity (Fig. 6B). Also, the 1% WT samples had a slight improvement both under full spectrum and visible light irradiation compared with TNFs. The photocurrent enhancement of the TC and WTC photocatalyst indicated an enhanced photoinduced electrons and holes separation by carbon, that served as an acceptor and a transport shell of the electrons, which could be attributed to the increased electrical conductivity, especially after its ordering. An obviously different electrical conductivity between the TNFs, WT, TC and 1% WTC can be confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 6C displayed the EIS of four electrodes. All the Nyquist plots impedance spectra were in open-circuit potential conditions and showed similar impedance mode. The nonlinear regression fitting using a conventional Randle's circuit (R (QR)) routine [40] gave active charge transfer resistance as: 1% WTC < TC < 1% WT < TNFs, which indicated that the core/shell nanofiber structure of the TiO2/WO3@carbon could reduce the charge-transfer resistance and enhance the electrolyte penetration. The introducing of WO3 could promote graphitization of carbon layer, which led to the further decrease of charge transfer resistance. Since a lower charge transfer resistance was indicative of recombination suppression by improving charge transport to the acceptor and then to electrolyte, these results suggested that both WO3 and carbon played important roles in improving the charge separation efficiency. Photocatalytic hydrogen production of as-fabricated samples was evaluated under 300 W xenon lamp irradiation using methanol as a scavenger. Fig. 6D presented a comparison of the photocatalytic H2 production activity of the TNFs, 0.5% WT, 1% WT, 1.5% WT, TC, 0.5% WTC, 1% WTC and 1.5% WTC samples. As can be seen from this figure, WO3 and carbon layer had a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. The role of heterojunction formed after addition of WO3 in TiO2 fibers was outlined by the evident improvement in H2 evolution rate by comparison of WT and TNFs. At the same time, the hydrogen evolution amount increased along with the increasing tungsten content, and it slowed down when tungsten content reached up to 1.5% in WTC samples. Carbon in WTC composites had excellent electron accepting and transferring capability, and could effectively restrain the recombination of the photo-excited electrons and holes, increasing the rate of hydrogen evolution [41]. In order to investigate the photochemical stability of the as-prepared one-dimensional nanofiber, cycling tests were proceeded and shown in Fig. 6E. Each experiment was carried out under identical conditions, and the photocatalytic activity of the 1.5%WTC remained a very small change in the four recycling reactions. It is worth mentioning that in this work the samples were one-dimensional nanofiber and could be easily separated from an aqueous suspension, owing to the large length to diameter ratio of the WTC."
14,Photoluminescence (PL) and incident photon-to-electron conversion (IPCE) spectra,"3.7 Photoluminescence (PL) and incident photon-to-electron conversion (IPCE) spectra The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all the as-synthetic samples were displayed in Fig. 7 . TiO2 exhibited a main emission signal peaking at ∼520 nm corresponding to emission peak energy of 2.38 eV. This emission signal originates from the charge-transfer transition from Ti ions to oxygen anion in a TiO6 8− complex [42]. The difference of about 0.82 eV between the band gap energy (≈3.2 eV for anatase) and the emission peak energy (≈2.38 eV) was caused by the Stokes shift due to the Franck-Condon effect. Close inspection of Fig. 7 revealed a small shift of the emission peak toward the shorter wavelength as more WO3 existed. Compositing with WO3 and carbon coating creates slightly different environments in transfer process, and therefore the spectra of the WT, WTC and pure TNFs were somewhat different. Since PL emission is the result of recombination of excited electrons and holes [43], the detailed mechanism is still being investigated. However, the results indicated that an appropriate amount of WO3 and carbon may suppress the radiative recombination process of photo-generated electrons and holes in TiO2. Drastic quenching of PL intensity of the WTC samples suggested a markedly enhanced charge separation by further addition of carbon component. As the spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies shown in Fig.S5, in identical situation, four different samples showed similar IPCE curves. Compared with TNFs and 1%WT electrode, an obvious improvement on IPCE was observed in 1%WTC electrode and TC electrode under both UV and visible light. In the wavelength of 400–600 nm, almost no free electron was received in pure TNFs electrode, by contrast, 1%WTC and TC displayed obviously enhanced response in visible light, which clearly illuminated that WO3 and surface carbon could help retard the hole-electron recombination process through surface and interfacial charge transfer. These results further demonstrated that the H2-generation rate of the as-prepared composite materials was enhanced compared with pure TNFs, WT and TC samples."
15,Postulated photocatalytic mechanism,"3.8 Postulated photocatalytic mechanism On the basis of the photoluminescence spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent analysis, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is elucidated schematically in Scheme 1 . The enhanced activities were mainly attributed to the solid-state Z-scheme photosynthetic heterojunction system with a carbon layer on the surface of TiO2 as an electron collector. Since the flat-band potentials (Efb) of WO3 and TiO2 are 0.33 and −0.2 V, in the precursor solution, they will be charged by negative and positive charges on their surface, respectively. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that they tend to attract each other due to the electrostatic force when they are formed and mixed together, leading to sufficient mixing and good contact between TiO2 and WO3 particles. Even the content of WO3 is quite low, the uniform distribution (Fig. 2) can make WO3 function efficiently. (I) The dispersive WO3 particles act as a hole collector, leading to effective charge separation on these semiconductors. (II) The function of carbon can be divided by their spacial distribution [14–17,44–46]. Generally, during the photocatalytic process, the carbon shell can act as both electron acceptors and donors, which can play dual important roles for the improved photocatalytic H2 production. Firstly, under UV light irradiation, normal carbon particles serve as the electron reservoirs to trap photoinduced electrons from the CB of TiO2, which facilitates the efficient separation of electrons and holes, and thus enhanced photocatalytic activity. Secondly, under visible light irradiation, the interfacial carbon act as a photosensitizer like organic dyes to sensitize TiO2 into a visible light responsive “dyade” structure, and donate the electrons to the conduction band of TiO2, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity. Due to the limited diffusion length of electron excited from carbon “dyade”, only the carbon intimately close the TiO2 surface, namely surfacially localized carbon, can function as donor. The addition of WO3 can promote the crystalization of graphite, which improved the electron transport in carbon layer as graphite has a better electrical conductivity than amorphous carbon. According to the previously reported charge transfer mechanism between TiO2 and WO3, the photogenerated electrons will transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to the conduction band of WO3. The work function (WF) for WO3 is higher than the WF of TiO2. When TiO2 contacts with WO3, electrons of TiO2 could transfer to WO3 until their WFs reach the similar level. Then, the interface band bending are formed (Scheme 1). The CB bending of TiO2 sets up a potential barrier. So, the existence of potential barrier goes against the transmission of photogenerated electrons from CB of TiO2 to CB of WO3. The same principle can be applied to the transfer of photogenerated holes from VB of WO3 to CB of TiO2. In contrast, the energy band structure is more beneficial to the transfer of photo-generated electrons from CB of WO3 to VB of TiO2. Based on the above analyses and results of experiments, the photocatalytic mechanism of TiO2/WO3 for H2 evolution are shown in Scheme 1 on the Z-scheme. As a result, WO3 can act as a hole collector to reduce the probability of photo-generated charge recombination, and more photogenerated electrons in TiO2 are available to reduce H+ to H2, which results in highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution activity."
16,Conclusion,"In summary, we have successfully realized multichannel improvement of charge-carrier based on the novel carbon-coated TiO2/WO3 nanofibers fabricated by combining the electrospinning technique and hydrothermal method. The H2-generation rate of the as-prepared core/shell nanofibers composite materials was greatly enhanced compared with that of pure TiO2 and TiO2/WO3 nanofibers. The enhanced performance was mainly attributed to the photosynthetic heterojunction system with the carbon shell on the surface of TiO2 as an electron collector and WO3 as a hole collector, leading to effective charge separation on these semiconductors. The addition of WO3 promotes the ordering of carbon layer and the graphitization of carbon in turn further contributes to enhancement of photocatalystic performance. Notably, the free-standing 3D nanotubes network structure could facilitate the separation and reuse of photocatalyst. Also, it is expected that the nanofiber network will promote their industrial application as clean energy materials."
