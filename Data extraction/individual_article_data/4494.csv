0,Introduction,"The technology for obtaining synthetic hydrocarbon fuels has long been developed. This process is based on gasification of coal to syngas and subsequent processing into hydrocarbons in line with the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (F-T) developed in the past century (Fischer and Tropsch, 1923; Liu et al., 2009; van Helden et al., 2020). An example of this technological success is the previous spread (nearly 60 years ago) of the Sasol plants in South Africa (Duvenhag and Shingles, 2002; van Dyk et al., 2006). Considering global trends and the strict policies of the European Union Commission concerning CO2 emission, the process in its classic form has no future. However, this situation created favourable conditions for the development of innovative technologies for obtaining hydrocarbons by mixing carbon dioxide and hydrogen (Fujiwara et al., 2015a,b; Styring et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2017). Such technologies should ensure that the desired products are obtained while at the same time utilising CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, which is one of ‘waste’ products generated by the 21st century civilisation (Hadjadj et al., 2019; He, 2017) (Bahri et al., 2019). The technological utilisation of CO2 should be adopted as ‘Cleaner Production’ technology, in which processes and products will meet the requirements of sustainable development. In a prior studies (Kaczmarczyk et al., 2017; Sahebdelfar and Ravanchi, 2015), it was shown that direct hydrogenation of carbon dioxide in the absence of CO in the reaction zone leads strictly to the production of methane as a sole product (Sabatier reaction). The higher hydrocarbons and liquid fuels obtained from the CO2/H2 mixture may be formed by two different pathways: • The direct method is based on a modified Fischer–Tropsch process using Co or Fe catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO2 (Torrente-Murciano et al., 2014; Visconti et al., 2016; Y. Yao et al., 2010, 2011). • In the indirect method, CO2 is converted to methyl alcohol and then transformed to hydrocarbons using the widely known methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process based on a zeolite catalyst (He, 2017; Matzen and Demirel, 2016; Van-Dal and Bouallou, 2013). In both cases carbon dioxide is only an initial reagent and is indispensable in obtaining carbon oxide or methyl alcohol, i.e., the materials required for the synthesis of hydrocarbons. The proposed reaction paths for both methods are illustrated in Scheme 1 (Fujiwara et al., 1997). In contrast with the FT process, MTG offers high-quality gasoline with little additional processing required. The products of the FT process include a wide spectrum of chain hydrocarbons (with the majority of chains containing more than 20 carbon atoms), whereas the MTG process produces gasoline, which is a mixture of hydrocarbons containing 5–10 carbon atoms."
1,Methanol to gasoline process (MTG),"1.1 Methanol to gasoline process (MTG) The Mobil MTG process was developed in order to create an economically and technologically better gasoline production method than the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. The MTG process converts methanol into gasoline through dimethyl ether (DME) (Boltz et al., 2013; Fujiwara et al., 2015a,b; Keil, 1999). Methanol can be obtained from syngas, (De María et al., 2013), which originates from the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RGWS), similar to the case of a modified FT process (CO2 –FT) (Van-Dal and Bouallou, 2013). CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O CO + 2H2 → CH3OH The MTG process runs in several stages (Scheme 2 ). In the presence of the catalyst, syngas in reactor (R1) is converted to methanol; subsequent dehydration in reactor (R2) creates DME, which has a high cetane number (55–60) and thus can be considered a valuable product, i.e., an additive to diesel fuels. In the third stage (R3), the equilibrium mixture composed of methanol, DME, and water is converted to olefins (MTO). In the next stage (R4), hydrogen transfer, alkylation, and condensation polymerisation convert the olefins to gasoline as the final MTG product comprising a mixture of paraffins, aromatics, naphthenes, and higher olefins (Boltz et al., 2013; Doluda et al., 2018). In the separator (S), unreacted gas is returned by recycling to reactor (R1) and water is carried towards the bottom. Scheme 3 shows the reaction path from syngas to gasoline via methanol. Fig. 1 shows the composition of the MTG process reagents as a function of time (Stöcker, 1999). With the use of CO2, the equilibrium yield of methanol (∼40%) is lower than with CO, with a greater hydrogen demand and the generation of water in the reaction environment of the former process. Separation of the reaction products (i.e., water from methanol) can improve the reaction efficiency. In such a modified system it is essential to choose a highly selective catalyst. Fujiwara et al. (Fujiwara et al., 2015a,b) proposed a composite catalyst for the process (CO2‒MTG), which was obtained by physically mixing Cu-Zn-Al oxides with HB zeolite, which was modified with 1,4-bis-(hydroxydimethylsilyl)benzene. The results are so promising that according to the authors, the composite catalyst is expected to contribute to the development of technologies for the production of fuels from CO2."
2,Role of thermodynamic analysis of reaction systems in designing CO2 utilisation processes,"1.2 Role of thermodynamic analysis of reaction systems in designing CO2 utilisation processes Thermodynamic analysis is generally useful in understanding and anticipating complicated catalytic processes. It can therefore also aid the comprehension of innovative processes and the design of strategies for the utilisation and conversion of CO2 for the production of hydrocarbons. It allows us to distinguish which reactions in these processes are thermodynamically favourable under specific process conditions and which are not. This analysis can be used to define the settings in which the thermodynamic limitation can be overcome for all stages of the process (Ahmad and Upadhyayula, 2019; Yao et al., 2017). Due to the inherent stability of the CO2 molecule (ΔG = −396 kJ mol−1) (Yang et al., 2017), the design and execution of processes in which this molecule participates as a carrier remains a strong challenge. The thermodynamic stability of the CO2 molecule hinders and even excludes the possibility of numerous reactions, as the transformation of CO2 requires a large energy input. Hydrogen is a high-energy molecule and thus can successfully be used to reduce CO2 to many value-added products (Dorner et al., 2010). The direct method of CO2 conversion via the modified Fischer–Tropsch process (CO2–FTS) occurs through the RWGS (reverse water gas shift) reaction (CO2–CO), with subsequent conversion of CO to hydrocarbons via the FTS (Drab et al., 2013). In turn, the indirect pathway (CO2 – MTG) after CO2 reduction to CO in the RWGS reaction proceeds via methanol-to-hydrocarbon conversion via the MTG (Porosoff et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017). The CO formation step (RWGS) is common for both innovative methods of obtaining hydrocarbons, as it can be effected via selective hydrogenation in the synthesis of methanol, but it also proceeds via the direct method for the production of hydrocarbons in the FT process. Although the RWGS is endothermic, the overall outcome of both processes, i.e., synthesis of methanol and the FT process with CO2 as a raw material (taking account of the RWGS reaction), is exothermic. As such, at low temperatures, the reactions in these processes are kinetically limited, and at higher temperatures, the reactions are limited by the thermodynamics. Kinetic analysis of the CO2–FT system shows that the reactions in the FT stage are much slower than the RWGS reactions, i.e., the reactions controlling the conversion of CO2 (Willauer et al., 2013). Higher CO2 conversion can thus be achieved if the FT stage in the general process is sufficiently quick to surpass the thermodynamic limitations of the RWGS, which is a challenge at the stage of designing a suitable catalyst for which the activity and selectivity are unaffected by the presence of additional of CO2 and water (by-products of the CO2–FT process) (Porosoff et al., 2016). The CO2–FT process is thermodynamically more favourable for the synthesis of hydrocarbons with a greater number of carbon atoms. In the case of the higher alkanes created in the FT process, the Gibbs free energy of specific reactions decreases as the length of the carbon chain increases, described by the following approximate relation (Müller et al., 2014): Δ G = ( − 54.1 × n − 52.8 ) [ k J m o l − 1 ] where n is the number of carbon atoms. The products of the FT process comprise a broad spectrum of chain hydrocarbons with a predominance of chains containing more than 20 carbon atoms. Further processing towards the production of fuels requires costly separation, cracking, and refining processes. FT gasoline does not contain aromatic hydrocarbons; thus, it has a relatively low octane number (below 40). The MTG process allows the production of a mixture of already selected C2‒C9 hydrocarbons, i.e., the lightest alkanes (without methane), predominantly pentane and hexane, with an octane number of 70–75 (gasoline). The synthesis of methanol from CO2 and H2 is less thermodynamically favoured than the synthesis of syngas (Ateka et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2000). The main reaction, i.e., conversion of CO2 and H2 to methanol, is exothermic and is accompanied by a reduction in the number of moles, and is thus favoured by high pressure and low temperature. In turn, the secondary reaction of the process (RWGS) is endothermic and has an effect on the thermodynamics of the synthesis of methanol in the same way as in the CO2–FT process. Because the MTG process appears to be more economically and technologically efficient for the production of gasoline from carbon than the FT process, this study focuses on thermodynamic analysis of a modified MTG process. Carbon monoxide, which is an input raw material at the stage of synthesis of methanol, was replaced with carbon dioxide, i.e., ‘waste’ produced by the 21st century civilisation. This analysis provides a basis for understanding the behaviour of the chemical components in this modified system and their interaction under various process conditions. It can serve as a point of departure for designing a strategy of CO2 utilisation, with simultaneous production of synthetic fuel; this study also provides insight for further optimisation of this innovative process. This report includes a sensitivity analysis of the values defined in the article (conversion, selectivity, and yield), as well as the thermodynamic functions (ΔG and ΔH) within the temperature range of 350–600 K, pressure range of 1–6 MPa, and with variation of the molar ratio of H2/CO2 in the range of 0.5–5.0. The analysis facilitates selection of the optimal process parameters. The design of new and effective (efficient and selective) catalysts remains a challenge. The first stage of this task should therefore be a thorough thermodynamic analysis of the reaction systems of these innovative processes. Making use of the results (suggestions), and given the thermodynamically available (under the respective conditions) reactions from density functional theory (DFT), we will be able to design specific catalysts and create modern techniques to build them."
3,Methodology,"Stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric self-complementing research approaches were utilised for full thermodynamic analysis of the examined system. The first requires knowledge of the qualitative composition of the system, i.e., the content of the individual chemical components, as well as information about anticipated independent reactions within the system, where the stoichiometric coefficients must be known. In the case of missing or incomplete knowledge about reactions or individual components identified in the system, the non-stoichiometric method is used to determine the equilibrium composition of the system under specific process conditions based on minimisation of the Gibbs free energy. Both methods determine the equilibrium of the system in a completely different manner. Thus, if the equilibrium composition estimated by both methods is identical under specific conditions, this may mean that in the stoichiometric approach (equilibrium constant method), all possible key reactions (i.e., the reactions for which the temperature-related equilibrium constant K = k1/k2 can be determined and the kinetic preferences can be assessed) in the system are taken into account. The thermodynamic equilibrium was examined by using a well-known method: minimisation of the Gibbs free energy. The calculations were performed by using the Aspen Plus platform. An algorithm available in the RGIBBS unit can determine the thermodynamic equilibrium for each of the phases. The equations below represent the conversion rates, i.e., selectivity and yield, with reference to the components of the examined system: (1) C o n v e r s i o n o f C O 2 : X ( % ) = N C O 2 , i n − N C O 2 , o u t N C O 2 , i n × 100 % (2) S e l e c t i v i t y o f s p e c i e s i : S i = j i N i , o u t − j i N i , i n N C O 2 , i n − N C O 2 , o u t (3) Y i e l d o f s p e c i e s i : Y i ( % ) = j i N i , o u t − j i N i , i n N C O 2 , i n × 100 % where N i,in and N i,out are the molar flow rate of species i at the inlet and outlet of the reactor, respectively, while j i is the number of carbons atoms in species i."
4,Calculation details,"2.1 Calculation details After setting the units of the measurements (describing the properties of the parameters and streams in the project), but before constructing a schematic model for the thermodynamic analysis, the components of the examined system (CO2, CO, CH3OH, CH3OCH3, and C) were defined. The system provides for the presence of carbon as one of the components remaining in thermodynamic equilibrium. For the calculation requirements of the program, carbon was assigned the status of a standard inert solid component that does not participate in the phase equilibria. The program anticipates the presence of such system components by assigning them the status ‘solids’. Other components participating in the phase equilibrium were assigned the status ‘conventional’. The next step involves selecting a thermodynamic method for estimating properties such as the constants of the reaction equilibria, enthalpy, and density. Here, the programme offers a number of various methods depending on the sort and type of substances present in the examined system. In this study, the Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK) equation of state was applied. This seems to be the best method, as it proves effective for most similar systems with a single component. The chemical equilibria set for the proposed components at various temperatures and pressures were examined using the features and properties of the RGIBBS theoretical reactor. This method allows (through minimisation of the Gibbs free energy) estimation of the equilibrium status of the system. The equilibrium results from synergy of the various energetic parameters of the individual reactions in the system. For deeper assessment of the system’s behaviour, it was helpful to analyse the enthalpy and free energy changes for all system reactions; the analyses were carried out based on theoretical RStoic and Requil reactors, where the models were implemented in the Aspen program suite. Knowledge of the temperature profiles (namely (1) the equilibrium composition of the reaction mixture, estimated by minimisation of the Gibbs potential in a theoretical equilibrium reactor (Rgibbs reactor), (2) the reaction free energy of the system (ΔG), (Equil reactor), (3) the reaction heat (ΔH) of the system, (Rstoic reactor)) derived from the analysis helps in determining the favourable process conditions for promoting the desired reactions in the system, while limiting the progress of other reactions such as coke deposition."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Definition of the system,"3.1 Definition of the system The C2+ compounds comprise a mixture of hydrocarbons such as LPG or gasoline, which are very valuable products. The mechanisms of generating these compounds from CO2 and H2 through FT as well as MTG are being intensively examined. The present analysis focuses on the thermodynamics of the modified MTG process in which syngas (CO + H2), as a raw material leading to the production of hydrocarbon fuel, was replaced with a mixture of CO2 + H2 in a specific ratio (H2/CO2). Following assessment of the kinetic-thermodynamic barrier of the modified process, the optimal process conditions were determined, and the effectiveness of the process was evaluated by comparison with the classic MTG process. Each process corresponding to Scheme 2 was divided into stages (all were represented by their specific sets of reagents and inter-reactions); analysis and thermodynamic equilibrium checks were performed for each stage. STAGE 1 - Synthesis of methanol and dehydration of methanol to DME. In its classic form (raw material: CO + H2), this stage is represented by reactions R1′– R3’. For the modified process analysed herein (raw material CO2 + H2), stage 1 is represented by R1–R3. Stage 1’ (CO) (R1’) C O + 2 H 2 ↔ C H 3 O H ( Δ H 298 = - 92 k J m o l - 1 ) (R2’) C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 ( Δ H 298 = - 41 k J m o l - 1 ) (R3’) 2 C H 3 O H ↔ C H 3 O C H 3 + H 2 O ( Δ H 298 = - 23.5 k J m o l - 1 ) Stage 1 (CO2) (R1) C O 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 3 O H + H 2 O ( Δ H 298 = - 49 k J m o l - 1 ) (R2) C O 2 + H 2 ↔ C O + H 2 O ( Δ H 298 = 41 k J m o l - 1 ) (R3) 2 C H 3 O H ↔ C H 3 O C H 3 + H 2 O ( Δ H 298 = - 23.5 k J m o l - 1 ) STAGE 2 – In stage 2, the equilibrium mixture of methanol, DME, and water is converted to olefins. In the adopted model, this process is represented by reactions R4 – R10. Stage 2 (R4) C H 3 O C H 3 → C 2 H 4 + H 2 O (R5) C H 3 O C H 3 + H 2 O ↔ 2 C H 3 O H (R6) 2 C H 3 O H → C 2 H 4 + H 2 O (R7) 3 C H 3 O H → C 3 H 6 + 3 H 2 O (R8) 4 C H 3 O H → C 4 H 8 + 4 H 2 O (R9) 5 C H 3 O H → C 5 H 10 + 5 H 2 O (R10) 6 C H 3 O H → C 6 H 12 + 6 H 2 O In general: n C H 3 O H → ( C H 2 ) n + n H 2 O ( R 4 - R 10 ) STAGE 3 – This stage takes account of only the hydrogenation of olefins to paraffins (R11–R15), which generates a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons with low contents of carbon, forming gasoline. Stage 3 (R11) C 2 H 4 + H 2 → C 2 H 6 (R12) C 3 H 6 + H 2 → C 3 H 8 (R13) C 4 H 8 + H 2 → C 4 H 10 (R14) C 5 H 10 + H 2 → C 5 H 12 (R15) C 6 H 12 + H 2 → C 6 H 14"
7,Thermodynamic analysis,"3.2 Thermodynamic analysis At each stage—based on thermodynamic analysis consisting of determination of the equilibrium composition of the system, calculation of the enthalpy (ΔH), free energy (ΔG), and equilibrium constants of the reactions—areas were identified which lacked any thermodynamic barrier. Taking account of all the reactions at the individual stages, the optimal process conditions were proposed for guaranteeing satisfactory effectiveness. 3.2.1 Stage 1: Synthesis of CH3OH and CH3OCH3 with CO2 and H2 The first stage involves synthesis of methanol and DME. It is described as a set of reactions comprising hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol (R1), the RWGS reaction (R2), and dehydration of methanol (R3). By analysis of the mole fractions of the components of the reaction (CO2, CO, H2, CH3OH, and CH3OCH3) remaining in equilibrium at different temperatures ranging from 473 to 573 K, at 1 MPa, with the use of a H2/CO2 = 3/1 starting composition, it is apparent that the conversion of CO2 was relatively low (Fig. 2 a). The impact of the examined temperature on the conversion of CO2 is derived from the combined greenhouse effect of the reactions occurring in the examined system (Fig. 3 a). Reactions R1 and R3 are exothermic, whereas R2 (RWGS) is slightly endothermic; thus, CO is produced at higher temperatures. In turn, a higher yield of DME and methanol can be expected in the lower range of the examined temperatures. Water produced under these conditions in R1 and R3 further shifts the RWGS equilibrium to the left, reducing the CO yield at lower temperatures (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2a shows that the CO2 conversion at 1 MPa with a raw material mole ratio (H2/CO2) of 3 was comparatively low, i.e., 20–25% (over the entire temperature range); the yield of the individual products (calculated per mole of CO2) was also low, although the DME yield was much higher than the methanol yield in the lower temperature range. Considering the combined DME and methanol yield, at 1 MPa pressure and H2/CO2 = 3, the lower temperature range is optimal, as it guarantees relatively high contents of DME and methanol (Fig. 2b). The DME and methanol selectivity under these conditions (temperature = 473 K) reached 0.73 and 0.14, respectively (Fig. 2c), compared to the corresponding values of 0.0038 and 0.013 at 573 K. Here, the RWGS reaction is dominant, with a CO selectivity amounting to 0.98. 3.2.1.1 Influence of pressure Increasing the pressure in the examined system moves the equilibrium of reaction R1 towards methanol production. As the methanol concentration increases, reaction R3 shifts towards increasing the CH3OCH3 yield. Water generated in these reactions reverses the RWGS reaction by reducing the CO content in the equilibrium system. At lower temperature (473 K), the endothermic effect of reaction R2 guarantees low participation of CO in the system. The increased yield of CH3OH and CH3OCH3 combined with the increased pressure leads to greater conversion of CO2 with (approximately) stable selectivity for the hydrogenation products (Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4b). At higher temperature (573 K) with a pressure of 1 MPa, CO is the dominant product, where the selectivity for its formation approaches unity (reaction R2). Increasing the pressure causes the contribution of reactions R1 and R3 to increase, clearly shifting the RWGS equilibrium reactions to the left. The CH3OH and CH3OCH3 yield rises, with a concurrent rise in the selectivity for these products. At 573 K, similar to the case at 473 K, the conversion increases with a simultaneous pressure increase, even though the temperatures are not significantly different, which can be explained by endothermic effect of reaction R2 (Fig. 4c). 3.2.1.2 Impact of H2/CO2 on thermodynamic equilibrium of the system The impact of the initial concentration of CO2 in the system was examined within the H2/CO2 range of 0.5–5 for the temperatures 473 and 573 K. The influence of the initial concentration on the equilibrium of the system was found to be considerable and different for both temperatures, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . At both temperatures, the conversion of CO2 increased to ca. 30% at the equilibrium composition of the mixture of the system as H2/CO2 increased. At lower temperature, increasing the H2/CO2 ratio caused the DME yield to increase to the greatest extent (to ca. 22%), while the methanol yield increased to a lesser degree (to ca. 4%) (Fig. 6a), with stable selectivities of 0.75 and 0.13. (Fig. 5a), respectively. Over the entire examined H2/CO2 range, the CO yield remained stable (ca. 3%), while the selectivity for this species declined from ca. 0.5 (H2/CO2 = 0.5) to ca. 0.1 (H2/CO2 = 5). At 573 K, the equilibrium composition of the system followed a different trend with variation of H2/CO2 (Figs. 5b and 6b). Due to the endothermic nature of reaction R2, the increase in the CO2 conversion is mainly related to the generation of CO. The yield of DME and CH3OH was low and stable over the entire H2/CO2 range (0.2 and 0.5%, respectively), whereas the CO yield increased from 10 to 30%. This was confirmed by the selectivity for CO, DME, and CH3OH production (see Fig. 5b). It is clear that the selectivity for CO production over the entire H2/CO2 range was close to unity. The present thermodynamic analysis of the influence of T, P, and the H2/CO2 ratio on the equilibrium content of CH3OH and CH3OCH3 in the system (composed of CO2, CO, H2, CH3OH, and CH3OCH3) confirms the results of previous studies (Shen et al., 2000), although the present analysis was separately conducted for two independent systems: (CO2, CO, H2, CH3OH) and (CO2, CO, H2, CH3OCH3). 3.2.1.3 Enthalpy (ΔH) and free energy (ΔG) of reaction in the system The change in the enthalpy and free energy of the reaction (where the change was anticipated in the first stage of the process) as a function of temperature is depicted in Fig. 3a and 3b. Fig. 3a shows that ΔH for the RWGS (R2) reaction within the temperature range of 470–570 K is greater than 0, whereas ΔH for reactions R1 and R3 at the same temperature was less than 0. This observation indicates that the RWGS (R2) reaction is endothermic, whereas the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH3OH and the dehydration of CH3OH to DME are exothermic. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is an indicator of the size of the thermodynamic barrier and possible inclination towards a spontaneous course of reaction. Fig. 3b shows that there are no thermodynamic obstacles and barriers for reaction R3, i.e., the dehydration and methanol, over the entire examined temperature range. A negative value of the Gibbs free energy illustrates that the reaction may occur spontaneously (without providing energy from outside) over the entire examined temperature range. In turn, although reaction R1 is exothermic (and its enthalpy is even smaller than that of reaction R3 (ΔH R1 < ΔH R3 ), it is the entropic nature of R1 that determines the non-spontaneous nature of this reaction in the examined temperature range. The gradient of the ΔG R1 = f(T) curve in Fig. 3b shows that R1 can be non-spontaneous at low temperatures. Reaction R2 will not proceed without providing energy, although in this case, the reaction may be spontaneous at high temperatures. Notably, the Gibbs free energy of reactions R1‒R2 is near zero. It can then be concluded that within the assumed temperature range, the thermodynamic barrier for these reactions is not very high. (R1) C O 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 3 O H + H 2 O ( Δ H 298 = - 49 k J m o l - 1 ) (R2) C O 2 + H 2 ↔ C O + H 2 O ( Δ H 298 = 41 k J m o l - 1 ) (R3) 2 C H 3 O H ↔ C H 3 O C H 3 + H 2 O ( Δ H 298 = - 23.5 k J m o l - 1 ) The obtained results are confirmed by the literature reports of other researchers. Similar variations of ΔG and ΔH with temperature for specific reactions were documented by Ahmad and Upadhyayula (2019), where the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of the main and side reactions at different temperatures was calculated from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation (Δ f G m θ ), standard enthalpy of formation (Δ f H m θ ), and heat capacity of related substances (Atkins et al., 2018; Haynes, 2012; Lide, 2005). Ahmed & Upadhyayula experimentally verified these analytical results. They emphasised the qualitative similarity (the same trend as the simulated values) in the trends, despite the experimental values being larger or smaller than the theoretical values for the conversion. According to the authors, the differences in the values resulted from kinetic limitations (the low value for the experimental conversion could be attributed to the kinetic limitations) and from the ""weaknesses"" of the catalyst, which could not overcome these limitations. In another study, Jia et al. (2016) verified the results of thermodynamic analysis of the separated system (stage 1) for the hydrogenation of CO2 to CO (RWGS). The good match between the calculated and experimental data further proves that the Gibbs free energy minimisation approach is highly effective for thermodynamic analysis of the CO2 hydrogenation process. 3.2.1.4 Comparison of effectiveness of classic versus modified MTG process Thermodynamic analysis was carried out for the classic MTG process using CO as a raw material to compare both versions of the process, assess their effectiveness, and draw conclusions concerning the possible benefits and losses resulting from replacing CO with carbon dioxide. Reactions R1‒R3 at the stage of synthesis of CH3OH and CH3OCH3 were replaced with reactions R1’–R3’. The profile of the changes in the conversion with temperature (for 1 MPa; CO/H2 = 1:2) proves the exothermic nature of the process at the stage of synthesis of CH3OH and CH3OCH3 (Fig. 7 a and 7b). The high conversion in the lower temperature range (ca. 100%) with a lower consumption of hydrogen was accompanied by a high yield of DME (ca. 70%) and low efficiency of CH3OH (2%) production (Fig. 7a). Lower temperature also favours the formation of CO2 in the exothermic reaction (WGS) (Fig. 7a). The decrease in the conversion and yield of DME and CO2 with temperature and the sustained very low content of CH3OH over the entire range of temperatures were accompanied by stable selectivity for the reaction products. i.e., synthesis of DME (0.65; R3’), formation of CO2 (0.3; WGS), and synthesis of CH3OH (0.05; R1’) (Fig. 7b). Analysis of the magnitude of the energy barriers of both process versions (by comparing Figs. 3b and 8 b) shows that the process with CO as the raw material is more favourable as an inherently self-driving process. Admittedly, the Gibbs free energy for reaction R1’ over the entire temperature range is > 0 (indicating the need to provide energy from outside to initiate process), but this value is not high. Although the modified process inspired by the idea of simultaneous utilisation of CO2 from the atmosphere is less effective (lower conversion and lower yield of DME), it is also thermodynamically feasible. The Gibbs free energy of two of the reactions in this process (exo - R1 and endo - R2 thermic in the examined temperature range) is > 0, but the low value does not exclude (in terms of technology) the possibility of spontaneously driving the process. Despite having lower effectiveness and a higher demand for hydrogen, the process employing CO2 utilisation may be useful for minimising the greenhouse effect. 3.2.2 Stage 2: Conversion of equilibrium mixture of CH3OH, CH3OCH3, and water to light olefins Under the process conditions, the equilibrium mixture of CH3OH, CH3OCH3, and water can undergo conversion to light olefins according to reactions R4–R10. The analysis based on the results of the stoichiometric model (Rstoic reactor) implemented in Aspen Plus software showed that reactions R4–R10 have negative enthalpy (ΔH < 0) (Fig. 9 a), which means these reactions are exothermic. The free energy change (ΔG) as a function of temperature, calculated based on the equilibrium reactor model (REquil), determines that within the examined range of temperatures, these reactions are spontaneous (thermodynamically feasible) (Fig. 9b). The change in the yield of olefins with temperature (Fig. 10 ) runs through a maximum, which moves towards lower temperatures as the number of carbons in the olefin increases. The yield of a particular olefin decreases only after the peak temperature is exceeded. Considering the previously established exothermic nature of the reaction, this trend confirms the presence of a kinetic barrier (activation energy) that must be overcome by raising the temperature. The sys curve (Fig. 9b) shows that the activation energy decreases for the R4–R10 series of reactions, and at higher temperatures, the formation of long-chain olefins is favoured, with fewer short-chain olefins. The influence of pressure on the selectivity and yield of olefins is characteristic here. Changing the pressure from 0.5 to 10 MPa at 473 K increased the C6H12 yield from 53 to 69% while decreasing the yield of olefins with shorter carbon chains. At 573 K within the same pressure range, the yield of C6 and C5 species increased at the expense of the C1–C4 species (Fig. 11 a and 11b). This change in the equilibrium yield profile of the individual olefins results from secondary oligomerization reactions of the lighter olefins, which combine to form heavier olefin molecules. Because these reactions occur with a change in volume according to Le Chatelier’s principle, an increase in pressure shifts the balance of these reactions to the right, which in turn leads to an increase in the content of C6 olefins at the expense of the C3 and C4 olefins. 3.2.3 Stage 3: Thermodynamic analysis of hydrogenation of olefins (C2–C6) Gasoline, i.e., a mixture of paraffin hydrocarbons (C2–C9), is formed by the hydrogenation of olefins obtained in a previous process stage. Because paraffins are more stable than the olefins from which they originate, the hydrogenation reactions should be accompanied by energy release in the form of heat. Fig. 12 a shows that the estimated enthalpies of all hydrogenation reactions (R11–R15) are less than zero within the temperature range of 370–1470 K, which in fact confirms that the reactions examined at this stage are exothermic. Moreover, the enthalpic effects (ΔH) of reactions R12–R15 do not differ significantly, ranging from −124 to −127 kJ mol−1. The only outlier is the enthalpy of the ethene hydrogenation reaction (R11) with an estimated ΔH of 37 kJ mol−1, which indicates that this reaction is accompanied by increased generation of heat compared to the other reactions. The exothermic nature of olefin hydrogenation is confirmed by the plot of the olefin conversion in the temperature range of 300–1500 K (Fig. 13 ). High olefin (C2–C6) conversion (ca. 100%) was maintained below 700 K. Above this temperature, the olefin conversion began to decline in accordance with the energy profile of these reactions. It is characteristic that the conversion curves of C3–C6 olefins as a function of temperature were almost coincident, whereas that of ethene (C2) runs above these curves, indicating that ethene conversion in the range of 700–1500 K, though declining, is still higher than C3–C6 conversion. This may result from the lower activation energy of the ethene hydrogenation reaction than in the case of other olefins, but this uniqueness of reaction R11 should be explained by thermodynamic analysis. Fig. 12b shows that the free energy (ΔG) increased with temperature for all reactions, confirming their energetic character. When reaction R11 runs spontaneously at temperatures as low as 1050 K (ΔG < 0), other reactions without thermodynamic barriers may occur only below ∼950 K. As shown in Fig. 12b, over the entire temperature range, the thermodynamic limitations of reaction R11 are lower than those of the other reactions. The analysis shows that the olefin hydrogenation reactions are more favourable at lower temperatures, bearing in mind that the thermodynamic limitations for the whole series of stage 3 reactions (R11–R15) cease below ∼950 K. Although the olefin hydrogenation reactions occur spontaneously below 950 K (ΔG < 0), the kinetic limitations and thus sluggishness of the reactions are derived from the relatively high activation energies. The selection and application of an appropriate catalyst to lower the activation energy of the reaction at this stage can considerably increase the speed. Fig. 14 a and 14b show the simultaneous influence of temperature and pressure on the conversion of olefins (C2H4 and C6H12) via hydrogenation. The curves confirm the soundness of the assumptions underlying adoption of the principle of mobile equilibrium. In general, the reactions are favoured at lower temperature (exothermic reactions) and higher pressure (reactions with a change of volume). In both cases, it is noticed that at lower temperatures, which already guarantee higher conversion, the impact of pressure 0.1–5 MPa is small and even insignificant. The lower conversion at higher temperature can be improved by increasing the pressure. The figure shows that at 773 K, an increase in the pressure ranging from 0.1 to 1 MPa results in a sharp rise in the conversion. This influence disappears as the temperature increases, and at 573 K, the effect of pressure is insignificant."
8,Conclusions,"Thermodynamic analysis of the classic MTG process that employs CO as a raw material allowed comparison with the modified version of the process, assessment of their effectiveness, and deductions concerning the possible benefits and losses resulting from replacing CO with carbon dioxide. The use of CO as a raw material is clearly more favourable in terms of the tendency towards a spontaneous reaction. However, thermodynamic analysis of the modified MTG process showed that the proposed replacement of CO with carbon dioxide as a raw material is worth consideration, and is potentially feasible. Each of the three stages in the reaction was assessed independently: 1 - Synthesis of CH3OH and CH3OCH3 from CO2 and H2 2 - Conversion of the mixture of CH3OH, CH3OCH3, and water to light olefins 3 - Hydrogenation of the olefins (C2–C6) to a mixture of paraffins, i.e., gasoline proving that the energetic barrier of none of the stages excludes (in terms of technology) the possibility of its occurrence. The modified process, inspired by the concept of simultaneous utilisation of CO2 from the atmosphere, although less effective (with a lower conversion and DME yield), is also feasible from the perspective of thermodynamics. Even though the Gibbs free energy of both 1st stage reactions (exo - R1 and endo - R2 thermic) within the examined temperature range is > 0, the low value does not exclude (in terms of technology) the possibility of the occurrence of these reactions. Therefore, at the cost of slightly higher energy consumption, less effectiveness of the process, and a higher demand for hydrogen, it is possible to utilise CO2 and minimise the greenhouse effect. The additional (although not prohibitive) requirements are derived from the first stage. The reactions in the second and third stage of the process occur spontaneously, and in this case, it is worth focusing on selecting a good catalyst. From comparison of the results obtained herein with the results of thermodynamic analysis of the modified (Cleaner Production) Fischer-Tropsch (CO2-FT) process, it is noted that both processes (CO2-FT and CO2-MTG) have a similar thermodynamic profile; in general, they are exothermic and comparatively demanding in terms of maintaining the ‘thermodynamic friendliness’ of the conditions. The combination of thermodynamic analysis with the knowledge of catalysis and reaction engineering may prove satisfactory in the area of the development of ecological technologies (cleaner production) for generating environmentally sustainable products."
