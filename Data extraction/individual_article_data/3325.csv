0,Introduction,"The development of inexpensive, clean, sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels is one of the most urgent needs of humanity, because the consumption of carbonaceous fuels is inextricably linked to pollution of the water, air, and land [1,2]. Solar energy has long been considered as a possible alternative – an inexhaustible, renewable, nonpolluting, and free energy source to address energy problems. Scientists are making efforts to effectively utilize solar energy by photovoltaic and solar fuel systems [3–10]. Solar electricity produced by solar cells is still expensive, difficult to store for a long time, and also affected by daily or seasonal variability in solar flux [11]. Conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels has been considered an efficient way to transform and store this abundant energy resource [12–16]. Hydrogen attracts much attention as a chemical fuel because it can be synthesized directly by solar energy via artificial photosynthesis. Furthermore, its chemical energy per mass is ∼142MJ kg−1, which is higher than other chemical fuels, and the burning of H2 results in an environmentally benign product (H2O) [17,18]. In 1972, Fujishema and Honda reported water splitting over TiO2 anodes under UV light [19]. Since then, numerous homogeneous and heterogeneous systems using organometallic or semiconductor photosensitizers have been studied for photocatalytic H2 production [20–23]. Among semiconductor photosensitizers, CdS has proved itself an attractive candidate for H2 evolution due to its narrow bandgap, low cost, and high photocatalytic activity [24,25]. However, CdS undergoes photocorrosion under long-term solar light irradiation. To overcome this drawback, various co-catalysts have been employed, including materials that use noble metals [26,27] and non-noble metals [16,28–30]. These co-catalysts enhance photocatalytic activity by accepting the photogenerated electrons and preventing charge recombination in CdS. In the literature, a few molecular co-catalysts have also been used with CdS to enhance the stability and efficiency of photocatalytic H2 production systems [31–34]. Another effective strategy is to functionalize the CdS surface with another semiconductor with a suitable bandgap to construct a heterojunction, which can enhance the photostability and photocatalytic activity by efficient transfer of photogenerated charge carriers [35]. Several hybrid semiconductors have been used, such as CdS/TiO2 [36–38], CdS/ZnS [35,39,40], CdS/ZnO [41,42], and CdS/Cu2O [43]. Among the wide bandgap semiconductors, ZnO has attracted much attention because of its higher electron mobility, stability, and high exciton binding energy (60mV) [44]. These properties make integration of ZnO with CdS of great interest, allowing unique physical and chemical properties in the photocatalytic reaction. Recently, CdS/ZnO hybrid semiconductors of varying size, thickness, and morphology have been reported [31]. Qureshi and co-workers synthesized an urchin-like nanostructured CdS/ZnO photocatalyst and obtained a high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate [45]. Kundu and co-workers reported that CdS/ZnO nanorod structures exhibited high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production [46]. In most studies, the photocatalytic experiments were performed under UV–visible light and CdS was deposited over ZnO. Wang and co-workers reported that a CdS shell over ZnO is not stable and suffers photocorrosion when subjected to long-term irradiation [47]. Motivated by previous studies, we report a novel photocatalytic system that incorporates the advantages of a CdS/ZnO core/shell nanorod heterojunction and a molecular cobalt–salen co-catalyst [35,48]. The system showed a highly enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution rate and great stability under visible light (λ>420nm). The highest H2 evolution rate over 50h was 725µmolh−1 mg−1 with a turnover number of ∼102,700 based on the cobalt–salen co-catalyst. The average apparent quantum yield is ∼41% and the highest is ∼44% under monochromatic 420nm light. Analysis of the recovered photocatalyst confirmed the formation of ZnS on the surface of ZnO/CdS NRs in the presence of a Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial electron donor. The effects of ZnS formation on catalytic activity and optical absorption properties were further investigated. Based on the spectroscopic results, a proposed mechanism is discussed for this enhanced photocatalytic H2 production."

Millipore water (resistivity ∼18MΩ·cm) was used to prepare aqueous solutions. The salen ligands and their corresponding cobalt complexes 1–4 were prepared according to reported procedures with minor modifications [49–51]. 2.1.1 Synthesis of 3-formyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (7.5g, 54.0mmol) was added into 20 mL trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in a 250 mL flask, followed by addition of 7.6g hexamethylenetetramine (54.5mmol) in 20 mL TFA under Ar. After being refluxed for 3h, the suspension became a clear yellow solution. After this was cooled to room temperature, 4M HCl (100 mL) was added to produce yellow precipitates and the mixture was stirred for 3h.

Refluxing for 3h produced a yellow precipitate. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the solid salen ligand was collected by filtration, washed with cold ethanol, and dried in vacuum. To synthesize Co complex 2, 0.249g Co(OAc)2·4H2O (1.0mmol) in 10 mL methanol was added to 10 mL methanolic solution of the above salen ligand (0.268g, 1mmol). The resulting mixture was refluxed for 2h, during which reddish brown precipitates appeared. The final product was collected by filtration, washed with methanol and water, and dried under vacuum overnight. Calculated m/z 325.04; found 325.03 (Fig. S2b).

After 2h of stirring at room temperature, orange yellow precipitates were collected by filtration, washed with cold ethanol, and dried under vacuum to obtain the salen ligand. To synthesize Co complex 3, 0.40g salen ligand (1.0mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL methanol, followed by addition of 0.248g Co(OAc)2·4H2O (1.0mmol) in 10 mL methanol. The resulting mixture was refluxed for 1h and brown precipitates appeared. The final product was collected by filtration, washed with methanol and water, and dried under vacuum overnight.

After 3h of refluxing, orange yellow precipitates appeared. Then 0.496g Co(OAc)2·4H2O (2.0mmol) in 10 mL methanol was added to this reaction solution. The resulting solution was further refluxed for 2h. Brown precipitates of the complex were collected by filtration, washed with methanol and water, and dried under vacuum overnight.

3,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalysts CdS nanorods (NRs) were prepared according to a reported method [52–54]. CdS/ZnO core/shell photocatalyst samples were synthesized by a chemical bath deposition reaction using Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, KOH, and citric acid. Typically, 101 mg CdS NRs was added to 50 mL water and ultrasonicated for 5min. Then 20 mg citric acid was added to the solution and the mixture was heated at 40°C for 30min with stirring. After it cooled to room temperature, 77 mg Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (0.35mmol) in 20 mL water was added dropwise to this suspension with continuous stirring. Then a 20 mL aqueous solution of KOH (0.21mmol) was added slowly to the reaction solution. After being stirred for 1h at room temperature, the final solid product was collected by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum overnight. The loading of 1wt% Pt on ZnO/CdS NRs was performed using a reported method [55]."
4,Physical characterization,"2.3 Physical characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-TTR III) was used to analyze the crystalline diffraction patterns of the CdS NRs and CdS/ZnO NRs, using graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation at 1.54178 Å, produced at 40kV and 200 mA. The scanning rate was 5° min−1 from 20° to 80° 2θ. Electronic absorption spectra were recorded with a UNICO SQ-3802 spectrometer. Mass spectrometry analysis of the metal complexes was performed using a MALDI-TOF (LTQ-Orbitrap XL) mass spectrometer, while a ESI (Xevo G2 QTof) mass spectrometer was used for 3-formyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Elemental analyses were carried out on an Elementar Vario EL Cube. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using a Solid Spec-3700 UV–vis spectrometer. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a JSM-6700F microscope. TEM images were obtained with a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope. XPS spectra were recorded on an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer."
5,Photocatalytic H2 production,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 production Photocatalytic experiments were performed under visible light (λ>420nm) using a 300W Xe lamp equipped with a UV cut filter at ambient temperature. In a typical experiment, 1.0 mg of semiconductor was used as the photosensitizer and Na2S and Na2SO3 were used as the electron donors in 20 mL water in a 50 mL round-bottom flask. The flask was sealed with a rubber septum and the reaction suspension was ultrasonicated for 10min. Then nitrogen (N2) gas was bubbled for 15min to remove air, followed by addition of 5 mL methane as internal standard [56]. H2 production was measured by gas chromatography (SP-6890, N2 as carrier gas) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
6,Apparent quantum yield,"2.5 Apparent quantum yield The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the photocatalytic H2 production reaction was calculated under optimal conditions. For visible light irradiation, a 300W Xe lamp was used, equipped with a monochromatic bandpass filter (λ=420nm±5nm). The following equations were used to calculate AQY and catalytic turnover (TON) number [31,32]: (1) AQY ( % ) = number of reacted electrons number of incident photons × 100 = number of evolved H 2 molecules × 2 number of incident photons × 100 (2) TON = number of product molecules number of co-catalyst molecules = number of evolved H 2 molecules number of co-catalyst molecules"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structural characterizations,"3.1 Structural characterizations According to the methods described in the Experimental section, cobalt–salen complexes 1–4 were successfully synthesized and characterized (Scheme 1 ). The as-prepared CdS NRs and ZnO/CdS NRs were characterized using powder XRD, SEM, TEM, and HRTEM techniques to confirm the crystal diffraction patterns and morphologies. For different samples, the weight ratios of ZnO to CdS were 2.16, 4.72, 9.84, 17.68, and 41.93% (measured by ICP-AES) and the corresponding photocatalyst samples were labeled ZD1, ZD2, ZD3, ZD4, and ZD5, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the semiconductor materials, in which all the crystal planes are well indexed to hexagonal CdS (JCPDS No. 77-2306). The diffraction peaks at 24.81°, 26.51°, 28.18°, 36.62°, 43.70°, 47.84°, and 51.82° can be assigned to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (112) faces, respectively. To compare with CdS/ZnO composites, pure ZnO was also synthesized, which gave the typical XRD pattern indexed to the wurtzite hexagonal structure (JCPDF No. 36-1451) [57]. The XRD peaks at 31.76°, 34.42°, 36.25°, 47.53°, 56.60°, 62.86°, 66.37°, 67.96°, 69.09°, and 72.56° correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201), and (004) faces, respectively. The CdS and CdS/ZnO composites show very similar XRD patterns. For photocatalyst heterojunctions ZD1–ZD3, no diffraction peaks of ZnO were observed, probably due to the very low content of ZnO on the surface of CdS. However, in samples ZD4 and ZD5, the ratios of ZnO increase and two new peaks appear in the range of 30° to 35°, which can be assigned to the (100) and (002) planes of ZnO. These results also showed that the crystallinity of CdS is not changed and ZnO is not doped into the crystal lattice of CdS. The SEM image of as-synthesized CdS shows nanorod morphology with lengths of 0.5–2μm and diameters of 40–90nm (Fig. 2 a). After loading with ZnO semiconductor, no change in morphology appeared, but the smooth surface of CdS NRs become rough due to the coating of ZnO particles, indicating successful deposition of ZnO (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the TEM image confirmed the results of SEM (Fig. 2c) and also indicated the 3–5 nm increase in diameter of CdS NRs after the deposition of ZnO (Fig. 2d). The core/shell structure of CdS/ZnO was further confirmed by the HRTEM image of sample ZD3. Lattice fringe distances of 0.260 nm in the shell and 0.336nm in the core were observed, corresponding to the (002) plane of hexagonal ZnO and the (002) plane of hexagonal CdS, respectively (Fig. 3 a) [37]. The EDX spectrum of ZD3 proves the presence of Cd, S, Zn, and O in the as-synthesized CdS/ZnO samples (Fig. 3b). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of complex 3, CdS, ZnO, ZD3, and ZD3/complex 3 are shown in Fig. 4 . The absorption edge of CdS was observed at 520 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of ∼2.4 eV. For ZnO, the absorption band edge at 390 nm indicates a bandgap of ∼3.2 eV. For ZD3, no particular change in the absorption spectrum was observed, suggesting that ZnO does not affect the bandgap of CdS (Fig. S3a). Furthermore, this result also indicates that the higher H2 production rate is probably not due to enhanced optical absorption of the photocatalyst. Integration of complex 3 did not cause significant change in the absorption edge of ZnO/CdS NRs, which suggests that the molecular co-catalyst cannot affect the bandgap of the as-synthesized core/shell ZnO/CdS photocatalyst."
9,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance Photocatalytic H2 production experiments were performed under visible light (λ>420 nm) using 0.75 M Na2S and 1.05 M Na2SO3 as electron donors and 1.0 mg CdS/ZnO photosensitizer in 20 mL water. Fig. 5 a shows the photocatalytic activity of ZnO/CdS core/shell samples ZD1–ZD5. It was observed that the ZnO:CdS ratio considerably affects the rate of H2 evolution, which is consistent with a previous result [42]. The H2 production rate gradually increases with the increase of the ZnO ratio in samples ZD1 to ZD3. The highest H2 evolution rate, 210 µmolh−1 mg−1, was observed for ZD3, a rate eight times higher than that for pure CdS NRs. This result shows that sample ZD3 has the optimal thickness of ZnO shell, suggesting efficient transport and separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Further increase in the ratio of ZnO from ZD3 to ZD5 results in a decrease in photocatalytic activity. This observation can be explained in terms of the role of the ZnO shell in photocatalytic H2 production. Similar observations have also been reported in the literature for photocatalyst heterojunctions [42,47]. In the present system, the ZnO shell is not an active semiconductor photocatalyst because of its wide bandgap (3.2 eV). For visible light irradiation, ZnO is almost transparent and the CdS core can be directly excited. Consequently, ZnO can only accept the photogenerated electrons from the excited CdS core. As the thickness of the shell increases from ZD1 to ZD3, the electron transfer process is facilitated by the increasing amount of ZnO, which provides more electron-accepting sites and ultimately boosts the H2 production rate. The optimal thickness of ZnO appears in ZD3. With further increasing thickness of ZnO from ZD3 to ZD5, more ZnO can hinder the visible light from reaching the CdS core, which probably caused the decrease in the H2 evolution rate. Fig. 5b shows the photocatalytic activities using cobalt–salen complexes 1–4 as the co-catalysts in aqueous solutions. The reaction system contains 0.02 mM cobalt complex co-catalyst, 1.0 mg ZD3, 0.75 M Na2S, and 1.05 M Na2SO3 in 20 mL water. All the cobalt–salen complexes showed an appreciable enhancement in rate of H2 evolution, suggesting that all these complexes are active co-catalysts for photocatalytic H2 production. Complex 3 exhibits the highest H2 production rate at 725 µmolh−1mg−1, which is about 29 times higher than for pure CdS NRs. In comparison, complexes 1, 2, and 4 show relatively low H2 production rates at 557, 345, and 420 µmolh−1 mg−1, respectively. The decrease in the H2 production rate of complexes 2 and 4 can probably be attributed to their low solubility in water [32,58]. Decreased solubility of the complexes will induce aggregation in aqueous solutions and cause poor contact with the photosensitizer. Thus, it may lower the chances of electron transfer from the photosensitizer to the molecular co-catalyst and decrease the rate of H2 evolution. The concentration of the molecular co-catalyst can play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of a photocatalyst for H2 production [31,58]. Further experiments were performed to optimize the concentration of cobalt–salen molecular co-catalysts (Fig. 6 a). Initially, the rate of H2 production increases with a higher concentration of complex 3 and the highest H2 production rate was observed at 0.02 mM (725 µmolh−1 mg−1). Further increases in the concentration of complex 3 cause a decrease in the rate of H2 production. This trend can be attributed to the fact that an excess of molecules of complex 3 can shield the visible light and reduce the catalytic activity of the semiconductor photosensitizer. To confirm the role of ZnO and complex 3 in the present photocatalytic system, a number of experiments were performed. No appreciable amount of H2 was detected for pure ZnO under visible light (Fig. 6b), confirming that ZnO is not an active photocatalyst for H2 production under these conditions. Pure CdS NRs showed quite a low H2 evolution rate (25 µmolh−1 mg−1), which increased by eight times (210 µmolh−1 mg−1) when they were coated with a ZnO layer. When the same ratio of ZnO and CdS was simply mixed under the same conditions, a low H2 production rate (90 µmolh−1 mg−1) was observed, suggesting that close contact between ZnO and CdS is critical [42]. Complex 3 with pure CdS NRs showed a H2 production rate of 365 µmolh−1 mg−1, which nearly doubled (725 µmolh−1 mg−1) when complex 3 was combined with ZnO/CdS core/shell NRs. In addition, no H2 was detected for a simple mixture of complex 3 and pure ZnO under the same conditions, which is consistent with the fact that pure ZnO is not an active photosensitizer under visible light due to its wide bandgap [59]. Moreover, this result also confirms that complex 3 cannot generate H2 by itself under visible light, although it shows absorption in the visible region (see Fig. 4). Fig. S3b shows that ZnO gives an H2 evolution rate of 3 µmolh−1 mg−1 under UV light, which remains unchanged upon addition of complex 3. This suggests that complex 3 cannot capture electrons from ZnO because cobalt–salen complexes have a more negative reduction potential than the conduction band of ZnO [60,61]. To compare the performance of Co–salen with that of Co2+, 0.02 mM cobalt nitrate was used to replace Co–salen co-catalyst under the same conditions (Fig. S4a). A H2 production rate of 580 µmolh−1 mg−1 was observed for Co2+, which is much lower than that of Co–salen (725 µmolh−1 mg−1). This observation further suggested the significant role of complex 3 in the present photocatalytic system. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of complex 3 was compared with that of the well-known noble metal co-catalyst Pt with 1wt% loading on ZD3 (ZD3/Pt). Fig. S4b shows that the H2 evolution rate reaches only 388 µmolh−1 mg−1 in ZD3/Pt during 3 h of irradiation, indicating that complex 3 is a more active co-catalyst under the present conditions. The photocatalytic stability and durability of the present system were explored under optimal conditions. Results of time course analysis of photocatalytic H2 evolution are shown in Fig. 7 a. No significant decrease in H2 evolution was observed during four cycles, indicating that the current photocatalytic system is stable and can produce H2 with good durability under visible light. Furthermore, long-term stability of this photocatalytic system was investigated under optimal conditions for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Fig. 7b shows that the photocatalytic system performed H2 production over 50 h with impressive TONs of ∼102,700. This result confirmed that the current photocatalytic system is highly efficient for photocatalytic H2 production in water with great stability. To check the chemical stability of the photocatalysts, CdS/ZnO NRs heterojunction photocatalyst was recovered by centrifugation after 10 h of irradiation. The solid sample was thoroughly washed with water. In addition, TEM was used to examine the stability of the photocatalyst after irradiation. Fig. S5 shows that no appreciable change appeared in the morphology of ZnO/CdS NRs, confirming the good stability of the photocatalyst. XPS measurements were used before and after irradiation for analysis of valence states and chemical composition of elements in the photocatalyst samples. Fig. 8 a shows the survey spectra of sample ZD3 before (red plot) and after (black plot) 10 h of irradiation. The XPS survey spectrum (red plot) confirms the presence of Cd, S, Zn, O, and Co elements. However, all elements are present except cobalt in the black plot, confirming the molecular nature of complex 3 during catalysis. The high-resolution spectrum of Cd3d shows two peaks at 404.75 and 411.50 eV, which can be attributed to the binding energies of Cd3d 5/2 and Cd3d 3/2, respectively (Fig. 8b) [53,62,63]. The binding energies of Zn2p appeared at 1021.65 and 1044.6 eV, corresponding to Zn2p 3/2 and Zn2p 1/2, respectively (Fig. 8c) [47,64]. The high-resolution spectrum of Co2p shows two peaks (red plot) at 781.30 and 796.30 eV, which can be assigned to cobalt in the complex (Fig. 8d) [65,66]. After 10 h of irradiation, no cobalt peak was detected (black plot in Fig. 8d), confirming that colloidal cobalt species are probably not produced during irradiation and enhanced photocatalytic H2 production is due to the molecular cobalt co-catalyst. The AQYs of the photocatalytic system were calculated using 0.02 mM co-catalyst 3, 1.0 mg ZD3, 0.75 M Na2S, and 1.05 M Na2SO3 under monochromatic visible light at 420nm. The experiment was performed for 6 h and the results for AQYs are shown in Fig. 9 . Initially, the AQY of the system was ∼36% and it increased after the first hour. The average AQY was ∼41% during the irradiation of 6 h and the highest AQY was ∼44%. This photocatalytic system showed comparable or even higher AQY than other systems based on molecular co-catalysts [28,31,32,67,68]. Fig. 8b shows a comparison of H2 evolution rates under aerobic and inert conditions. The photocatalytic system had a lower H2 production rate (401 µmolh−1 mg−1) under aerobic conditions than under inert atmosphere. A decrease in the H2 production rate under aerobic conditions might be due to the presence of O2, which can produce H2O as a result of backward reaction over the surface of a catalyst [54,69]. Photophysical properties of the photocatalyst were studied by steady state PL spectra to understand the charge transfer process. Pure CdS shows two typical emission bands centered at 506 and 712 nm (Fig. 10 ) [33]. The high energy peak at 506 nm can be attributed to near-bandedge emission and the broad peak centered at 712 nm might be due to structural defects [54,70]. CdS/ZnO NRs material shows significant quenching of luminescent intensities due to rapid charge transfer at the ZnO/CdS interface. Furthermore, when molecular co-catalyst 3 is loaded onto the semiconductor heterojunction, the emission result shows a further passivation effect on the PL intensities of CdS, indicating possible electron transfer from the CdS of ZnO/CdS NRs to complex 3. As a result, an effective electron transfer process takes place in this present photocatalytic system, which can lead to enhanced photocatalytic activity of the system."
10,In situ formation of ZnS and its role in photocatalysis,"3.3 In situ formation of ZnS and its role in photocatalysis It has been reported that the formation of ZnS took place on the surface of ZnO during photocatalytic process in aqueous solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 [71,72]. In our present study, ZnO/CdS NRs photocatalyst was irradiated under visible light to generate electron–hole pairs. Na2S and Na2SO3 scavenge the photogenerated holes through various pathways (Scheme S1). The produced S2− ions react with SO3 2− to form S2O3 2− and S2− ions [48]. The S2O3 2− ions then generate HSO3 2− and S due to the presence of H+. Finally, Zn2+ ions react with S2− to form ZnS over the surface of ZnO [73]. To confirm the presence of ZnS, sample ZD3 was recovered after 3 h of photocatalysis and labeled as ZD3-R. Fig. 11 a shows the EDX spectrum of ZD3-R, indicating the presence of Cd, Zn, S, and O elements. An obvious increase in the intensity of the sulfur signal and decrease in the intensity of the oxygen signal can be attributed to formation of ZnS [48]. The change in the XRD pattern was not so obvious for ZD3-R, probably due to the dominant crystalline peaks of CdS and low content of ZnO (Fig. S6a). To observe the change in ZnO during photocatalysis, ZD5 with a higher content of ZnO was used under the same conditions and labeled as ZD5-R. After irradiation, the formation of ZnS can be observed by the typical XRD patterns located at 28.55° and 47.51° (Fig. 11b). Moreover, pure ZnO was also used for irradiation. After that, three new XRD peaks appeared at 28.55°, 47.51°, and 56.28° (Fig. S6b). All the peaks can be well indexed to (111), (220), and (311) faces of ZnS, respectively (JCPDS No. 05-0566). This observation further confirms in situ formation of ZnS. To explore the role of ZnS in enhanced H2 production, sulfur-free benzyl alcohol was used as the sacrificial reagent (Fig. 11c). ZD3-R showed an H2 evolution rate more than two times higher than that of ZD3, proving the significant role of ZnS in enhanced photocatalytic H2 production [74]. Fig. 11d shows the UV–vis diffuse absorption spectra of ZD3 and ZD3-R. No obvious change in the absorption edge of ZD3-R was observed, suggesting that the enhanced H2 production is not due to increased optical absorption. In ZnO/CdS NRs, visible light irradiates the CdS and generates electron–hole pair, while ZnO remains inactive due to its wide bandgap [75]. The photogenerated holes react with sacrificial electron donors. The photogenerated electrons move from the conduction band of CdS to the less negative conduction band of ZnO for water reduction (Scheme S2a) [44,76]. After the formation of ZnS, two types of interfaces, ZnS–CdS and ZnO–ZnS, are constructed. At the ZnS–CdS interface, ZnS provides photogenerated charge carrier acceptor sites to CdS, as discussed in our previous work [35]. Although ZnS has a higher conduction band and a lower valance band than those of CdS, the photogenerated holes of CdS can be transferred to the localized acceptor sites resulting from the zinc vacancies (VZn) and interstitial sulfur (IS).[39] These acceptor sites lie above the valance band of ZnS and can easily quench the holes from valance band of CdS (Scheme S2b) [48]. Furthermore, the sacrificial reagents will quench these holes and be oxidized to the decomposition products. In ZnO–ZnS interface, electrons cannot be excited from the valance band for water reduction under visible light due to wider bandgaps of ZnO and ZnS (Scheme S2c)."
11,Role of the molecular co-catalyst,"3.4 Role of the molecular co-catalyst To investigate the mechanistic role of complex 3, UV–vis spectroscopy was used during the photocatalytic reaction. A Pt chromophore (platinum terpyridylphenylacetylide complex) was selected as photosensitizer, inspired by previous studies [32,56,77]. Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a mixed solution of water and acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) at pH 13 containing TEOA (1.6×10−2 M) as the electron donor, Pt chromophores (1.5×10−5 M) as the photosensitizer, and complex 3 (2×10−5 M) as the co-catalyst. The results are shown in Fig. 12 a. Initially, the absorption spectrum was the sum of the reaction mixture components (Fig. S7). After 30 min of irradiation, the solution color changed from light yellow to brown, indicating an obvious light-driven chemical change (Fig. 12b). Consequently, a new broad peak appeared in the range of 580–800nm, which can be attributed to the formation of a Co(I) intermediate during the photocatalytic reaction [78,79]."
12,Proposed photocatalytic mechanism,"3.5 Proposed photocatalytic mechanism Based on the above results, we propose a mechanism for the current photocatalytic system. Generally, the H2 production mechanism for molecular cobalt co-catalysts involves monometallic and bimetallic pathways [80–82]. For the monometallic pathway, the photocatalytic reaction rate shows a linear dependence on the concentration of the cobalt complex, while a quadratic dependence can be attributed to the bimetallic pathway [77]. For the present photocatalytic system, a linear dependence of the H2 production rate on the concentration of complex 3 can be observed, as shown in Fig. S8. Therefore, we propose a mechanism involving a monometallic pathway for photocatalytic H2 evolution in the ZnO/CdS/complex 3 system. A schematic description of the proposed mechanism is shown in Scheme 2 . In detail, the thin ZnO shell is transparent to visible light due to its broad energy bandgap [75], and the electron–hole pairs can be generated in the CdS core upon visible light irradiation [44,83]. The visible light excites electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of CdS [75]. On the other hand, the photogenerated holes move toward ZnS formed in situ and finally are scavenged by Na2S and Na2SO3, leading to decomposition of these electron donors [35,48,73,84]. The photogenerated electrons are rapidly transferred from the conduction band of CdS to the adjacent lower conduction band of ZnO due to the type II heterojunction [44,76,85]. Complex 3 can also accept photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of CdS and be reduced to the cobalt(I) species. In this present photocatalytic reaction, the cobalt(I) species can play a key role by accepting a proton to produce cobalt(III)-H [78]. Cobalt(III)-H species will follow two routes for H2 production. One route (a) involves protonation of cobalt(III) H, H2 production, and reduction of cobalt(III) to cobalt(II). On another route (b), electrons can reduce cobalt(III) H species to cobalt(II) H species, which can liberate H2 molecules after accepting protons. See Scheme 3 ."
13,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the present study constructed a novel photocatalytic system for H2 production by incorporating a molecular cobalt–salen co-catalyst with a CdS/ZnO semiconductor heterojunction photocatalyst, in which both ZnO and the molecular co-catalyst can improve electron transfer processes and effectively prevent charge recombination. In situ generation of ZnS due to the presence of Na2S and Na2SO3 also promotes the photoinduced charge transfer. As a result, the system showed highly enhanced photocatalytic H2 production in water. Under optimal conditions, the heterojunction photocatalyst combined with cobalt–salen co-catalyst produced a H2 evolution rate of 725 µmol h−1 mg−1 under visible light with TONs of ∼102,700. The average AQY of the system reached∼41% under monochromatic 420nm light. This photocatalytic system can enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution with good durability due to the following advantages: (1) The thin ZnO shell is transparent to visible light and electrons can be directly excited in the CdS core. (2) The photogenerated electrons can move swiftly from the conduction band of CdS to the neighboring conduction band of the ZnO shell due to the favorable energy band configuration. (3) Moreover, in situ ZnS formation also increases the charge transfer process and decreases the charge recombination in the CdS core. The ZnO/ZnS shell enhances stability by protecting the CdS core from photocorrosion. (4) Due to the core/shell structure, a large interfacial region is available for improved electron–hole separation. (5) The cobalt–salen complexes as co-catalysts further improve charge separation by accepting electrons from CdS and thereby significantly enhance H2 production in water."
