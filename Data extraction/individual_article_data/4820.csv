0,Introduction,"Propolis is a resinous mixture collected by honey bees from the leaf, bud, crust etc. of various plants. The physical and chemical properties of propolis mainly depends on the area being collected and the method of the collection. Propolis is rich in essential oils and phenolic components so it has high levels of antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumoral activity. (Ahn et al., 2007; Aliyazıcıoğlu, Şahin, Ertürk, Ulusoy, & Kolaylı, 2013; Li, Awale, Tezuka, & Kadota, 2008). Over the past 20 years, the tendency towards the use of natural remedies has increased because of the side effects of synthetic medicines and the resistance of disease factors to these medicines. As a result of this situation propolis has become popular as an alternative and complementary medicine product. Propolis also has a wide range of uses in cosmetics, food and agriculture sectors. Crude propolis dissolves best in ethanol because of its resinous nature. There are several trademarks of propolis extract prepared with ethanol and they are presented to public consumption. The harmful effects of alcohol consumption limit the use of ethanol-based propolis extract. In addition, the type of alcohol used during the preparation of the propolis extracts produced by unlicensed operators adversely affects human health. Additionally, even though propolis contains many bioactive compounds like flavonoids, phenolic acids, aldehydes and ketones, its application in food industry as a food additive is limited because of its alcohol solubility, strong taste and aroma (Busch, Gonzalez, Sepatin, Santagapita, & Ulrih, 2017; Cottica et al., 2015). In order to overcome these problems, encapsulation could be a practical approach. Microencapsulation is an entrapment of a compound or a system inside a material for its immobilization, production and functionalization. Micro particles consist of two parts, one of them is a core material such as bioactive components of propolis or herbal extracts and drugs etc. and the other one is the shell. The most important feature of the microcapsules is the ability to control the release of the core material in a right place and right time (Gouin, 2004). The term micro particle implies to a particle that the dimension of which varies between 1 and 1000 μm (Singh, Hemant, Ram, & Shivakumar, 2010). The choice of encapsulation material and process is governed by three main criteria as the application, economic and safety respectively. Alginate, a polymer which occurs naturally in brown algae, is linear 1,4 linked copolymer of β-d-mannuronic acid (M) and α-l-guluronic acid (G) residues in varying proportions. Alginate exhibits mucoadhesion property, biocompatibility, biodegradability, immunogenicity and ability to form gels in the presence of multivalent ions like Ca2+ and this method is called as ionic gelation (Onsquen, 1992; Mortazavian, Razavi, Ehsani, & Sohrabvandi, 2007). In literature there are some papers describing encapsulation of propolis ethanol extract by using different techniques. Some of these encapsulation methods using biopolymers like gelatine, casein and chitosan as an encapsulating agent involve organic solvents or other reagents. These solvents or reagents are toxic. On the other hand, it was reported that encapsulation efficiency of these techniques for propolis extract did not exceed up to 80%. Other techniques such as spray drying requires high temperature, which could be destructive for propolis active compounds. Ionic gelation is simple, cheap and not required toxic solvents. Hence, this method could be an alternative to encapsulate propolis ethanol extract without using toxic solvents and for achieving high encapsulation efficiency. The aim of this study is to microencapsulate the active ingredients of ethanol-based propolis extract with sodium alginate, a biopolymer which is used as food additives. The obtained capsules could be an alternative to consume propolis in a powder form that is free of alcohol. Also, the capsules may find application in food industry as a food ingredients. (Gibbs, Kermasha, Inteaz Alli, & Mulligan, 1999; Peanparkdeea, Iwamoto, & Yamauchi, 2016)."

Gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, catechin, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, epicatechin, rutin, trans-cinnamic acid, luteolin and ferrulic acid were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Munich, Germany). Folin Ciocalteu phenol reagent was purchased from Fluka Chemie GmbH (Switzerland). Other chemicals used in the study were off analytical grade."
3,Preparation of propolis extract,"2.2 Preparation of propolis extract Raw propolis samples were collected from Artvin and Zonguldak cities, Turkey. 10 g of raw propolis samples were mixed with 100 mL absolute ethanol and shaken for 24 h under controlled speed. Then, the mixture was filtered with Buchner doing vacuum with a filter paper. Obtained clear filtrate was used as propolis extract."
4,Determination of alginate solubility in alcohol water mixture,"2.3 Determination of alginate solubility in alcohol water mixture Sodium alginate, a biopolymer, is soluble in water but there is a confusion of sodium alginate's solubility in water/alcohol mixture. In order to clarify the conflict, solubility of sodium alginate in water/alcohol mixture was determined by dissolving sodium alginate 1% (w/v) in different ratio of alcohol/water mixture ranging from 10% to 50% (v/v). Solubility of sodium alginate in alcohol/water mixture was defined by obtaining homogeneous solution."
5,Preparation of alginate and propolis-alginate beads,"2.4 Preparation of alginate and propolis-alginate beads Alginate beads were prepared by ionic gelation method (Abinden, Deladino, Navarro, Amaly, & Martino, 2011) with some modifications. Sodium alginate 1% (w/v) was dissolved in 30% (v/v) ethanol solution and then 2 mL of propolis extract was added into this solution and homogenized. Sodium alginate solutions with and without propolis extract were dropped through a syringe into a calcium chloride solution (0.05 M) for obtaining propolis-alginate and alginate beads respectively. Composed beads were continued to stir for hardening about 15 min. Then, the beads were filtered. Filtrate was collected and stored to determine total phenolic content. The capsules were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 5 h."
6,Characterization of physical and chemical parameters of the beads,"2.5 Characterization of physical and chemical parameters of the beads Amount of total polyphenols, total flavonoids and total condensed tannins in propolis extract and filtrate were determined to identify the chemical composition of the beads. Polyphenolic composition of the crude extract and filtrates were determined by HPLC-UV. The spectrum of alginate and alginate-propolis beads were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FT-IR) The size and morphology of alginate and alginate-propolis beads were determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). 2.5.1 Determination of total polyphenols The amount of total polyphenols of propolis extract and filtrate was determined according to Folin–Ciocalteu method (Slinkard & Singleton, 1977). This method is based on reducing the reagent by phenolic compounds to blue-coloured complex that gives maximum absorbance at 760 nm. Gallic acid was used as a standard. Results were expressed as mg of Gallic acid equivalents per mL sample. Total phenolic content of the propolis extract and filtrate obtained after capsulation were determined, and the encapsulation efficiency was calculated by using the formula given below. Encapsulation efficiency %= (A- B)/A*100 where; A is the amount of total polyphenols as mg GAE/mL in crude propolis extract B is the amount of total polyphenols as mg GAE/mL in filtrate. 2.5.2 Determination of total flavonoids The amount of total flavonoids content in propolis extract and filtrate was measured by spectrophotometric method at 415 nm and quercetin was used as a standard. 0.5 mL samples, 0.1 mL of 10% Al(NO3)3 and 0.1 mL of 1 M NH4·CH3COO were added to a test tube and incubated at room temperature for 40 min then absorbance was read against a blank at 415 nm (Fukumoto & Mazza, 2000). Results were expressed as mg of quercetin equivalents per mL sample. Encapsulation efficiency was calculated. 2.5.3 Determination of condensed tannins The amount of condensed tannins of propolis extract and filtrate was determined by using the method described by Julkunen-Tiitto (1985). (+)-Catechin was used as a standard in the concentration range of 0.03125–1 mg/mL 25 μL of sample was mixed with 750 μL vanillin solution in 4% methanol into a test tube. Then 375 μL of 37% HCl was added to this solution and incubated for 25 min. The absorbance of the tubes was recorded at 500 nm and standard calibration curve was generated. Results were calculated and expressed as mg of catechin equivalents per mL sample. Encapsulation efficiency was calculated. 2.5.4 Determination of balsam % Balsam is usually defined as the alcohol soluble fraction of propolis. In order to determine the ratio of balsam, 2 mL of propolis extract was evaporated and the amount of resulted solid was quantified until reaching a constant weight. The amount of balsam of the extract was calculated and expressed as a percentage value (Popova, Trusheva, & Bankova, 2017). 2.5.5 Determination of phenolic composition by HPLC-UV Propolis extract and filtrate obtained after beads production were subjected to re-extraction for HPLC analysis. For this, the solvent of the extract and filtrate was removed and the residues were dissolved in 10 mL acidified (pH 2) distilled water separately. Re-extraction was carried out firstly with 5 mL diethyl ether then with 5 mL ethyl acetate for 3 times for each. Organic phases were separately combined and the solvents were removed in rotary evaporator at 45 °C. The residues were re-dissolved in 2 mL of methanol and filtered with 0.45 μm filter. The filtrates were injected to HPLC. Fourteen polyphenolic standard compounds were analysed using HPLC (Elite LaChrome; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a reversed phase Fortis C18 column (Chromex Scientific, 150 mm* 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Acetonitrile/water (7/3 ratio) and acetic acid 2% were used as mobile phase and a programmed gradient was applied. Reservoir A contained 2% acetic acid and reservoir B contained 7/3 ratio of acetonitrile/water. Elution of samples began with the eluent composed of 95% of reservoir A and 5% of reservoir B for 3 min. Then, the ratio of reservoir A was decreased gradually to 20% at the end of 30 min. Later, gradient program was shifted to starting point of 95% reservoir A for 20 min more. 20 μL of samples was injected individually at room temperature and flow rate was set as 0.75 mL/min (Can et al., 2015). For quantitative determination, regression coefficient of calibration curve for each phenolic component were between 0.998 and 1.000."
7,Release of alginate-propolis beads in vitro digestive system,"2.6 Release of alginate-propolis beads in vitro digestive system In vitro digestive system was constituted by using simulated gastric and simulated intestinal fluid. For gastric system pH 1.50 HCl/KCl buffer and for intestinal system pH 6.80 and 7.40 phosphate buffer with 1% Tween 80 solutions were prepared respectively (Korkmaz, Girgin, Sunna, Yavaşer, & Karagözler, 2016). 0.15 g alginate-propolis beads were put in 30 mL of these solutions separately. Obtained mixtures were put in a bath at 37 °C. Once every 30 min, 2 mL of solution was sampled out from the mixtures individually. The amount of total polyphenols in the samples was determined and the release of beads was calculated as percentage value respectively."
8,Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),"2.7 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) SEM analysis was performed at Karadeniz Technical University, Department of Material Engineering. Alginate and alginate-propolis beads were coated with gold and then analysed by using ZEISS EVO LS 10 scanning electron microscope at 15 kV. SEM images of the beads were observed and the size of the beads were determined as well."
9,Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FT- IR),"2.8 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FT- IR) ATR-FT-IR spectrum of alginate beads, alginate-propolis beads and propolis extracts were recorded by using a Perkin Elmer, FT-IR 2000 model spectrometer equipped with an ATR cell with single reflectance germanium crystal. Spectrums were recorded as an average of 16 scans with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 between the ranges of 4000 cm−1 to 650 cm−1 wavenumber against background spectrum for each analyses respectively."
10,Statistical analysis,2.9 Statistical analysis All measurements in this study were repeated at least three times and results were expressed as mean value with standard deviations. These values were calculated by using Microsoft excel.
11,Results and discussion,
12,Solubility of sodium alginate in alcohol/water mixture,"3.1 Solubility of sodium alginate in alcohol/water mixture It was reported by McHuag (1988) that alginate is insoluble in ethanol or ethanol/water mixture but solubility of sodium alginate especially in alcohol-water mixture should be carried out to encapsulate propolis extract efficiently. It is known that ethanol or water-ethanol mixture (70%) is the best solvent for propolis. For obtaining alginate-propolis micro beads, propolis extract should be homogenized in 1% sodium alginate solution. When the ethanol extract of propolis was added into 1% sodium alginate solution, the balsam of the extract was precipitated out and non-uniform mixture was obtained. In order to overcome this problem, we decided to find out the solubility of sodium alginate in ethanol-water mixture. Sodium alginate was solved in different ratio of ethanol-water mixture. Results were pointed out in Fig. 1 . It was found that sodium alginate was soluble up to 40% of ethanol-water mixture and over the 40% of ethanol-water mixture sodium alginate was precipitated as expected. We decided to prepare alginate solution in 30% ethanol-water mixture not to exceed the alcohol ratio of 40% by considering the addition of ethanol-based propolis extract into the sodium alginate solution."
13,Preparation of alginate and propolis-alginate beads,"3.2 Preparation of alginate and propolis-alginate beads Alginate and alginate-propolis capsules were obtained by ionic gelation techniques. The effect of sodium alginate concentration on the encapsulation efficiency was studied by adding 1 mL of propolis extract into different concentration of sodium alginate solution separately. The results were given in Fig. 2 . It was found that 1% sodium alginate concentration is the best in terms of encapsulation efficiency. It is clear from the figure that there was not a significant shift in the encapsulation efficiency when the sodium alginate concentration was increased. It was decided to prepare alginate-propolis micro beads at 1% sodium alginate concentration by considering the price of the bead production. After standardization of sodium alginate concentration, the amount of propolis extract that could be capsulated by 1% sodium alginate was defined as well. For this purpose, different volume of propolis extract was mixed 1% sodium alginate (10 mL) solved in 30% ethanol-water mixture and beads were obtained as mentioned before. Encapsulation efficiency was calculated and results were demonstrated in Fig. 3 . It is clearly seen from the figure that 2 mL of the propolis extract was found the best because of the disruptive effect of ethyl alcohol on sodium alginate. Although there was not significant decline in encapsulation efficiency when added 2.5 mL of propolis extract in 1% sodium alginate but some doughy particles containing propolis were observed indicating the beginning of the degradation of sodium alginate. In a study conducted by Avanço and Bruschi (2008) ethyl cellulose micro particles were prepared by emulsification and solvent evaporation method. Encapsulation efficiency was reported as 62.99 ± 0.52%. In another study, Nori et al. (2011) reported that propolis extract was encapsulated by complex coacervation, a pH dependent method. Soy protein and pectin were used as encapsulation agent and encapsulation efficiency was expressed as 72.01 ± 0.01 and 66.12 ± 0.01% respectively. Reis et al. (2017) prepared propolis capsules in order to use them for oxidative stability. A polymer which calls Capsul® was used as encapsulating agent and propolis loaded capsules were obtained by spray drying method. Encapsulation efficiency was reported as 76.86 ± 0.02%. Silva et al. (2011), prepared propolis capsules by using spray drying method. They reported that the usage of this method caused 30% loss of phenolic content because of inlet temperature. Propolis extract was encapsulated with β-cyclodextrin by Kalogeropoulos et al. (2009). It was reported that lower encapsulation efficiency of propolis extract was achieved. This is the first paper reporting the capsulation of ethanol based propolis extract by solving sodium alginate in 30% ethanol-water mixture. By this modification we observed that nearly all components (99.3%) of propolis extract were capsulated."
14,"Determination of total polyphenols, flavonoids, condense tannins and balsam","3.3 Determination of total polyphenols, flavonoids, condense tannins and balsam After optimization of the propolis-alginate micro beads preparation, the amount of total polyphenols, total flavonoids, condense tannins and balsam were determined in propolis extract and filtrate respectively. The amount of these components in alginate propolis beads were calculated and results were summarized in Table 1 . It is obvious from the results that most of the components in propolis extract were encapsulated."
15,Phenolic profile of the beads,"3.4 Phenolic profile of the beads Propolis extract and the filtrate obtained after microbeads production were analysed by HPLC-UV to determine the phenolic profile of the alginate-propolis micro beads in comparison with fourteen standards. HPLC-UV chromatograms of the fourteen standard, propolis extract and filtrate obtained after bead production were given in Fig. 4 . The concentration of the standards and polyphenolic compounds were calculated from their peak area respectively. It was found that the propolis extract contained vanillic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, rutin, trans-cinnamic acid and luteolin. Phenolic profile of the beads was clarified after determining the amount of these phenolic compounds in the filtrate by subtracting the value calculated for propolis extract than the value of filtrate. It was found that alginate-propolis beads contained all this phenolic compounds at high level as shown in Fig. 5 . Calculated results were also summarized in Table 2 . Vanillic acid and luteolin were nearly encapsulated 100%. Kalogeropoulos et al. (2009) reported that vanillic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and trans-cinnamic acid were capsulated with β-cyclodextrin at different ratios of 15.4, 19.4, 23.3, and 20.6 respectively. When compared to the literature, it is clear that encapsulation of the propolis extract with sodium alginate is more effective. Solving sodium alginate in alcohol-water mixture contributed to the encapsulation efficiency."
16,Release of alginate-propolis beads in vitro digestive system,"3.5 Release of alginate-propolis beads in vitro digestive system Release of alginate-propolis beads in vitro digestive system was determined using pH 1.5, pH 6.8 and pH 7.4 for 4 h. Once every 30 min 2 mL of solution was sampled out and total polyphenols was determined as mentioned previously. The release of the beads was calculated as percentage value and results were shown in Fig. 6 . It is clear from the figure that after 2 h all alginate-propolis beads were decomposed in pH 7.4 solution. It is obviously seen from the figure that the release of propolis in alginate beads depends on the pH of the solution. The release of propolis in gastric fluid is lesser than intestinal fluids. Our results are quite convenient with the literature. It was reported that glibenclamide was released from alginate beads more effectively at pH 7.4 than pH 1.2 (Nayak, Das, & Maji, 2012). In a study tamoxifen was encapsulated by alginate/gum arabic micro beads and release of tamoxifen was found better at pH 7.4 than pH 1.5 (Korkmaz et al., 2016). This result could be explained by the better swelling ability of alginate beads in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer because Ca2+ in the bead structure forms calcium phosphate helping the decomposition of the beads (Korkmaz et al., 2016)."
17,Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),"3.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) SEM analysis of the beads were conducted by using ZEISS EVO LS 10 scanning electron microscope at 15 kV. Recorded images were given in Fig. 7 . The shape and size of the beads were evaluated as well. It was found that the shape of the beads was spherical. It can be seen from the figure that the beads have rough and porous surface. During the drying process, some aggregation happened as seen from the SEM images. The average size of the alginate-propolis beads was determined as in between 500 and 800 μm."
18,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),"3.7 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) The FT-IR spectra of alginate beads, alginate-propolis beads and propolis extract were displayed in Fig. 8 . A great similarity is observed between alginate propolis beads and propolis extract, mainly the peaks at 3357, 2924, 2852 and the peaks in the range of 1693-1000 cm1−. The observed bands at 3357 cm−1 could be related to hydroxyl groups (-OH of phenolic compounds), 2924 and 2852 cm−1 could be related to the stretching vibration of C-H bonds. The peaks in between 1700 and 1000 cm1− could be related to aromatic ring (C=C stretching vibration), due to flavonoids and amino acids (stretching vibration of C=O and C=C bonds and asymmetric bending vibration of N-H), due to ester group (stretching of –C-O- bond). Similar results were reported in literature (Oliveira et al., 2016)."
19,Conclusion,"Bioactive properties of propolis such as antimicrobial, anticancer, antioxidant and antiviral were often stated in literature. Although propolis has high amount of bioactive components, the availability of these components from crude propolis samples was highly limited because of its resinous nature. Extraction of these bioactive components from propolis is a way to make them available but this time ethanol is the limiting factor for consumption. In this study we aimed to overcome all these limiting factors of propolis consumption. Bioactive component of propolis was extracted with ethanol then the ethanol extract was encapsulated by sodium alginate. Obtained propolis-alginate beads were dried in a vacuum oven and ethanol was removed from the beads. By this way consumable alcohol-free propolis capsules were obtained. The release properties of the beads revealed that bioactive components of propolis could reach the upper part of large intestine. This situation may increase the bioavailability of these components as well. The beads could be consumed as a food supplement or they may find application in food industry as a food additive."
