0,Introduction,"Increasing global energy demand, existing under the background of the serious environmental problems, associated with burning of fossil fuels, and the use of new low-carbon energy providing depend on renewable resources is much important to sustainable communities [1–6]. For the clean energy carrier, H2 promises great expectance to open a new path in the future carbonless energy economy, since it has the highest energy density per unit mass and only releases a harmless substance such as water as a by-product [7–9]. Nevertheless, there are still difficulties in the production and storage of H2. When metal hydrides and other chemical storage materials are used for storage of H2, they have received great attention because of their high hydrogen content and their easy charging as solid materials [10]. Hydrogen, which is an environmentally friendly energy source for the future, has high energy density (142 kJ/g) [11,12]. Because of its high hydrogen storage potential and high hydrogen amount released, the chemical hydrides have accepted as an excellent hydrogen storage material and hydrogen production sources [13]. Rare earth or alkaline earth based hydrides, and borohydrides play a great role in the transport and storage of hydrogen [14–18]. Alkali (Li, Na and K) metals have excellent capacity to developed borohydrides M(BH4)n, as hydrogen production and storage material [19]. Between these, potassium borohydride (KBH4) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) have found practical applications in portable fuel cells by hydrolysis or methanolysis reaction, which allow easy hydrogen release and carried out under mild conditions [20]. For example sodium borohydride is more stable, non-toxic and nonflammable chemical hydride. Total hydrogen stored mass of sodium borohydride is % 10.6 and the hydrogen released mass by hydrolysis of sodium borohydride is % 10.8. However, due to excess enthalpy and activation energy of NaBH4 in H2 generation system [21,22] the scientists have begun to tend to KBH4. Although the difficulties occurred by using KBH4 that has high thermal dehydrogenation temperatures (>550 °C) and so limited thermal recycling, potassium borohydride is a nominee that supplies the most remarkable requirements to satisfy the expectancies with its high gravimetric hydrogen capacity as exceeds 7.4% hydrogen and good hydrolytic characteristic [23–25]. Since borohydrides self-hydrolysis in alkaline aqueous solution, potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide (KOH or NaOH) is added to the solution to balance the reaction and to prevent the self-hydrolysis hydrolysis of MBH4 [26]. Therefore, small amounts of MOH should always be present to extend the shelf life of the MBH4 solution. MBH4 self-hydrolysis reaction has been displayed in equation (1): (1) MBH 4 ( s ) + 4 H 2 O ( l ) → 4 H 2 ( g ) + MB ( OH ) 4 ( aq ) The reaction mechanism of self-hydrolysis has been explained [27] as: MBH 4 ( aq ) ⇌ M ( aq ) + + BH 4 ( aq ) - BH 4 ( aq ) - + H ( aq ) + → BH 3 ( aq ) + H 2 ( aq ) BH 3 ( aq ) + 3 H 2 O ( l ) → B ( OH ) 3 ( aq ) + 3 H 2 B ( OH ) 3 ( aq ) + H 2 O ( l ) ⇌ B ( OH ) 4 ( aq ) - + H ( aq ) + 4 B ( OH ) 4 ( aq ) - + 2 H + ( aq ) ⇌ B 4 O 7 ( aq ) - 2 + 9 H 2 O ( l ) M = Na, K Some of the other parameters that affect the hydrolysis of borohydrides can be listed as: amount of water contained in all borohydrides, pH value, temperature, and crystalline water of the by-product (NaBO2), etc. [28]. Additionally, it is also very important to develop effective catalysts in order to the hydrolysis reaction can proceed in a controlled manner. NaBH4 and KBH4 hydrolysis reactions (2), which can be kept under control in the presence of a catalyst, are exothermic processes and contain high purity hydrogen. Potassium and Sodium borohydrides (KBH4, NaBH4) are recognized as perfect supplies that used for hydrogen storage [29]. (2) MBH 4 + 2 H 2 O → catalyst MBO 2 + 4 H 2 + Q ↑ M = Na, K In existence of catalysts the sodium borohydride hydrolysis reactions proceed as follows [30]. M + BH 4 - ⇌ MBH 4 M + H 2 O ⇌ MH + MOH MBH 4 + MOH → MBH 3 OH + MH MH + MH → 2 M + H 2 M = Metal catalyst Because of their producing of slightly moist and clean hydrogen, these borohydrides are able to use in fuel cell systems for PEM cells [31]. Since hydrolysis reaction of sodium and potassium borohydrides are go on slowly, the nature of the used catalyst is very important to determine the rate of hydrogen production [32]. It is known that heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts allow the hydrolysis reactions of NaBH4 and KBH4 to proceed much faster with comparing their liquid acid counterparts [33,34]. The solid metal-based catalysts are more attractive for H2 generation [35–41]. Therefore, on a large scale, the current application of these technologies have based on the search for effective catalysts to accelerate the reaction and thereby increase efficiency [42].Transition metals display wonderful catalytic activity in both NaBH4 and KBH4 hydrolysis. Various metals as Fe [39,43–45], Ni [46–49], Cu [50–52],and Rh [53],Ru [54], ruthenium (III) acetic acid [55], Ru [56], Pd [38,53,56], Pt [53,57], Au [54,58], have been studied as a catalyst for hydrogen generation. NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction has been widely studied [59,60] however the investigation of KBH4 hydrolysis is very limited [41,61]. In literature many papers that interested in NaBH4 hydrolysis but a few studies was presented in the hydrolysis of potassium borohydride. Moreover, it has not been existed the study about palladium complex catalyzed potassium borohydride hydrolysis so far. Herein we report synthesis and characterization of 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-ditert butylsalisyl aldimine-Pd complex. Additionally its catalytic activity tested in the hydrolysis reaction of potassium borohydride for hydrogen generation with depend on different temperatures, substrates concentrations and Pd complex catalyst amount. The generated hydrogen was monitored by water-gas displacement technique. Furthermore the catalyst durability was tested and obtained 95% stability after sixth used. As a result, it was seen that 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-ditertbutylsalisylaldimine-Pd complex is an effective catalyst in KBH4 hydrolysis reaction for H2 production."

5,Results and discussions,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) of reaction solution were recorded in transmission mode at normal incidence using a (FT-IR) (VERTEX 70v FTIR Spectrometer) operated at room temperature, XRD patterns were recorded with using Rigaku X-Ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 154.059 pm) radiation at a scanning rate of 5 °C min−1, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded with JEOL JSM 5800. The important surface area datas were derived from the BET theory with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement. TEM investigations were performed by using A JEOL JEM-3010 transmission electron microscope. Elemental analyses measurements of catalyst was carried out on a LECO CHNS 932 model elemental analyzer. 3.1.1 BET analysis The Brunauere Emmette Teller (BET) analysis method is utilized to define the pore distribution and size in solid samples at high and low pressures. Since the surface area of the catalyst is one of the most important factors that affecting catalyst activity, large surface area also means high performance. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was 61.1630 m2/g for Palladium Schiff Base complex catalyst that prepared in ethyl alcohol. The pore values and the pore size patterns of the Palladium complex catalyst was obtained as 0.1805 cm3/g and 10.6251 nm as seen Table 1 . BET analysis indicates that Pd-Schiff Base complex can produce excellent pore structure and the big surface areas of Pd complex catalyst, and this indicates that the Pd-Schiff Base complex particles have got many micro pores, which is well known that the higher the quantity of the micro pores, the catalytic activity as a result of high active area through hydrolysis reaction. 3.1.2 FT-IR analysis According to the FT-IR spectrums the most important peaks of 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-di-tert-butylsalisylaldimine Schiff Base ligand that determined in our previous work [34], and its Pd(II) complex, was indicated in Table 2 . Between ligand and complex, there are some differences. The bands explained in the spectra of the complexes at 412 cm−1 corresponding to N →Pd vibrations and 517 cm−1, corresponding to O →Pd and which support the interest of O and N atoms in complexation, ligand with metal ions, however they didn't exist for Schiff Base ligand. Another proof that formation of complex is ν(-C=N-) frequency. For ligand, the band is seen at 1643 cm−1; with complexation, the band is shifted to lower frequency to 1627 cm−1. This situation is due to –C=N →Pd coordination. For ligand, there is a broad peak at 3200 cm−1 that belongs to –OH group but it has disappeared when complex formed and this is also one of the proof for complexation. In addition, it is available in some similar bands with small changes for both Schiff Base complex and ligand. For example the bands at 2954 and 2959 cm−1 are determined as intramolecular free –OH groups or OH…N for ligand and complex respectively. For C=C stretching vibration owing to aromatic ring of the aldehyde for Schiff base ligand the absorption bands were present at 1548 cm−1, and shifted to 1523 cm−1 in Pd-Schiff Base complex. Bands from the C–O-ligand and belonging to the Pd (II) -Schiff Base complex and Schiff Base ligand respectively, are appeared at 1048–1152 cm −1 and 1100–1200 cm −1. The observed band for C–H stretching at 790–650 cm−1 and phenol –OH of aromatic aldehyde at 1281 cm−1 that was disappeared after complex formation with Pd–O bond. The bands at 1000-1200 cm−1 and 2753–2947 cm −1 means –CH3 vibrations of the structure of complex and ligand. All this results shows that the ligand is tetradentate coordinating via O, N. 3.1.3 XRD analysis XRD analysis was applied to describe the physical properties and the crystallinity of the ligand and its complex. The structures of Pd-Schiff base complexes were investigated by X-ray diffraction at 2ϴ, 0–80°. In Fig. 2 the X-Ray diffraction peaks of Pd(II) complex was indicated. Pd(II) complexes exhibited sharp peaks. Line extension of Pd(II) complex diffraction peak showed higher crystallinity and indicated that it has not amorphous nature. The main diffraction peak of Pd(II) complex occurred at around 2θ of 24.92° and the sharp peak at 23.12° and 25.80° caused by intramolecular hydrogen bonds indicates the crystalline nature of the sample. To the X-Ray patterns it is clearly seen that Pd(II) complex has a crystalline structure. The most important seven peaks are appeared at 2θ with 23,12°; 23,61°; 24,92°; 25,80°; 28,86°; 30.95°; 32.52° and corresponding to 225, 148, 350, 276, 126, 87, 79 respectively. Thus, the sharp and clear peaks have been supported that the complex has been shown a crystalline structure. 3.1.4 Scanning electron microscope analysis Scanning electron microscopy is used for the investigation and analysis of the microstructure morphology of catalysts with the shape, size, aggregation and physical state of the surface of compounds were explored by scanning electron microscopy. In catalysis reactions, the study of morphology, surface and internal microstructure chemical composition of catalysts plays a key role in the synthesis of compounds, crystals, etc. with increasing lifetime, selectivity and conversion rate. The micrographs of palladium complex Fig. 3 indicated that the presence of well-defined crystals free from any shadow of the metal ion on their external surface. The SEM images of Pd-complexes displayed a plate with an irregular rough surface. It is clear from the SEM images that in the Pd-complex were found to grow up from just a single molecule to several molecules in an aggregate distribution with particle sizes starting from a few nanometers to several hundred. Additionally SEM analysis of the Pd(II)- Schiff Base complex is exhibited in Fig. 3 that were taken upon the analysis of different sizes. It seem that the Palladium Schiff Base complex display different quirky solid form with respect to the Fig. 3. On the structure, can be said that completely coated the surface of the catalyst and the light colored Pd metal particles lie on the ligand. The scanning electron microscope analysis of Pd(II)-complex displays large formed and light colored particles and Pd metal particles are clearly seen. This is supported the possible complex formation. 3.1.5 Transmission electron microscope analysis (TEM) Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4b display TEM images of 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-ditertbütilsalisilaldimine-palladium complex. As shown in Fig. 4a and b. dark colored palladium metal particles with a round shape and diameter of 5–50 nm are observed on the 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-ditertbütilsalisilaldimine ligand. TEM data indicates that the messy metal particles in a homogeneous distribution on surface of ligand. Therefore TEM analysis results were supported the other analysis techniques (FT-IR, SEM, BET, XRD, Elemental Analysis) that described the successful synthesis of 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-ditertbütilsalisilaldimine-palladium complex. 3.1.6 Elemental Analysis Elemental analyses measurements of the novel palladium complex was carried out on a LECO CHNS 932 model elemental analyzer. Elemental Analysis (calculated for C38H48Cl4N2O4Pd) (F.W: 845.03 g/mol) (%): C: 54.01; H: 5.73; N: 3.32. Found: % C: 53.94; H: 5.71; N: 3.28. Elemental Analysis indicates that, 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-ditertbütilsalisilaldimine- palladium complex was completely formed, and supports the results of previous analysis."
7,Hydrolysis experiments,"3.2 Hydrolysis experiments 3.2.1 KBH4 hydrolysis in the presence of different concentrations of KOH It is admitted that KBH4 and NaBH4 are too stable at high pH. The borohydride solution stabilized using a base (KOH, NaOH …) is not hydrolyzed if there is no catalyst media. KOH concentration effect in hydrolysis of KBH4 catalyzed by 15 mg Palladium Schiff Base complex was investigated by different concentration of KOH usage as 0%, 5%, 7%, and 10% in 2.0% KBH4 solution at 30 °C. The graph of the produced hydrogen volume against time is displayed in Fig. 5 . It is clear that the generation time of hydrogen decreased by the increasing concentration of KOH. Palladium complex catalyzed KBH4 hydrolysis generated only 170 mL H2 in the absence of KOH in 120 min. In the presence of 5% KOH 380 mL H2 in 105 min, in the presence of 7% KOH 380 mL H2 in 85 min and in the presence of 10% KOH 380 mL H2 generated in 70 min. Furthermore, the initial rates (R0) of Palladium complex catalyzed KBH4 hydrolysis reaction with different KOH concentrations were calculated and are given on Table 3 . It can be seen that with increasing KOH concentration from 0% to 10%, the initial rates of hydrolysis reaction were begun to increase as 15807; 22757; 34667; 54973 mL H2/gcat.min respectively. 3.2.2 KBH4 hydrolysis in the presence of different amounts of catalyst Effect of 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-ditertbutylsalisylaldimine-Palladium complex catalyst amount on hydrogen production from the hydrolysis of KBH4 with 10% KOH was investigated using various amount of Palladium complex catalyst as 5, 15, 25 and 50 mg in 2.0% NaBH4 solution at 30 °C. The graph of the produced hydrogen volume against time is displayed in Fig. 6 . It is clear that the generation time of hydrogen decreased by the increasing amount of Palladium complex catalyst. The Palladium complex catalyzed KBH4 hydrolysis generated only 380 mL H2 in the presence of 5 mg Palladium complex catalyst in 120 min, 70 min in the presence of 15 mg catalyst, in 60 min in the presence of 25 mg catalyst and in 60 min in the presence of 50 mg catalyst. Furthermore, the initial rates (R0) of KBH4 hydrolysis reaction with different Palladium complex catalyst amount were calculated and are given on Table 4 . The initial rates are surprisingly begun to decrease as 109806; 54973; 36632; 25644 mL H2/gcat.min respectively with increasing Palladium complex catalyst amount from 5 mg to 50 mg. This is caused from saturation of the catalyst active sites. With using 5 mg complex obtained maximum reaction rate. After The excess of 5 mg, this resulted in clogging of active sites of the catalyst and reduced catalytic activity. 3.2.3 KBH4 hydrolysis in the presence of different concentrations of KBH4 Effect of KBH4 concentration in hydrolysis of KBH4 was investigated with various concentration of KBH4 as 2%, 5%, 7%, and 10% with 10% KOH solution at 30 °C. The graph of the produced hydrogen volume against time is displayed in Fig. 7 . It is clear that the generation time of hydrogen increased by the increasing concentration of KBH4. The Palladium complex catalyzed KBH4 hydrolysis generated 380 mL H2 in the presence of KBH4 in 70 min. In the presence of 5% KBH4 955 mL H2 in 175 min, in the presence of 7% KBH4 1350 mL H2 in 165 min and in the presence of 10% KBH4 1870 mL H2 generated in 290 min. Furthermore, the initial rates (R0) of Palladium complex catalyzed KBH4 hydrolysis reaction with different KBH4 concentrations were calculated and are given on Table 5 . It can be seen that with increasing KBH4 concentration from 2% to 10%, the hydrogen generation rates were begun to increase as 54973; 65915; 67410; 70127 mL H2/gcat.min respectively. 3.2.4 KBH4 hydrolysis in the presence of different temperatures The reaction temperature effects on the hydrolysis of KBH4 catalyzed by 15 mg 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-ditertbutylsalisylaldimine-Palladium complex was studied at various temperatures as 20 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C with 10% KOH in 2.0% NaBH4 solution. The graph of the produced hydrogen volume against time was displayed in Fig. 8 . It seen that the generation time of hydrogen reduced by the increasing of temperature from 20 °C to 50 °C with 115 min–45 min. Furthermore, the initial rates (R0) of Palladium complex catalyzed KBH4 hydrolysis reaction with different temperatures were calculated and are given on Table 6 . It can be seen that with increasing temperatures from 20 °C to 50 °C the initial rates of hydrolysis reaction were also begun to increase as 15448; 54973; 70913; 85480 mL H2/gcat.min respectively."
8,Kinetic studies,"3.3 Kinetic studies The rate of hydrogen release from potassium borohydride hydrolysis reaction, reported in mL H2/gcat.min was studied in the presence of 15 mg 5-Amino-2,4-dichlorophenol-3,5-ditertbutylsalisylaldimine-Palladium complex can be explain by nth order reaction equation; (3) − r KBH 4 = − dC KBH 4 dt = k. C KBH 4 n Separating and integrating, we obtain: (4) − ∫ C K B H 40 C K B H 4 d C K B H 4 C K B H 4 n = k ∫ 0 t d t (5) 1 ( n − 1 ) ( 1 C K B H 4 n − 1 − 1 C K B H 40 n − 1 ) = k t (6) 1 C K B H 4 n − 1 = ( n − 1 ) k . t + 1 C K B H 40 n − 1 The reaction rate order has been reported with different temperature and n conjectural by correlation coefficient R2 as 0.9536 in Eq. (6). In present work, the reaction order is found 0.7 from Fig. 9 . The activation energy is calculated as 25.194 kJ/mol at 20–50 °C temperatures range from the Arrhenius equation as shown in Fig. 10 ."
9,Catalyst durability,"3.4 Catalyst durability For the explanation of Pd complex catalyst durability, with washing the catalyst with deionized water and drying at room temperature remove all impurities from the surface of the catalyst, reused 6th times in all reaction recycle. As shown in Fig. 11 the Pd(II) complex catalyst completed its catalytic activity with 95% efficiency on the 6th experiment in hydrolysis of KBH4. These results display that the palladium complex catalyst protects its stability and it has a strong durability during using in the potassium borohydride hydrolysis."
