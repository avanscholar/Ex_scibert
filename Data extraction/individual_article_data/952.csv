0,Introduction,"Global warming is caused by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion (Montzka et al., 2011) and this has been the primary source to satisfy the world's energy demand (Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008). The scientific community agree that it is necessary to mitigate the depletion of fossil fuel resources and to protect the environment against their negative effects by exploring new renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources that could replace fossil fuels (Dharmadi et al., 2006). Of all of the renewable energy sources, which include ethanol or algal diesel, hydrogen (H2) is an interesting alternative to be explored since it has several advantages when compared to fossil fuels. These advantages include the following: (i) molecular hydrogen has a higher energy bond by a factor of around 3 when compared to carbon fuels (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Momirlan and Veziroglu, 2005; Mudhoo et al., 2011), (ii) nontoxic by-products are produced by breaking the H2 covalent bond, (iii) hydrogen is a renewable, efficient and clean energy source (Hansel and Lindblad, 1998) and (iv) it is utilized for fuel cells in portable electronics, power plants and internal combustion engines (Dunn, 2002). However, H2 is currently considered as a clean energy carrier rather than an energy source because it does not come from natural sources. Indeed, H2 is produced mainly by the electrolysis of water (Armaroli and Balzani, 2011), by the water-gas shift reaction (Yi and Harrison, 2005), and as a by-product from petroleum refining or chemical production (Das and Veziroǧlu, 2001; Westermann et al., 2007). These methods for H2 production are neither ecological nor environmentally friendly because they require high energy input to generate H2 gas (Das and Veziroǧlu, 2001). The commercial production of H2 by electrolysis of water achieves an efficiency of 75%; however, the cost of this process is currently several times higher than that of hydrogen produced from fossil fuels (Ewan and Allen, 2005). Moreover, most of the production depends on fossil resources and this is clearly unsustainable (Edwards et al., 2007). It is therefore necessary to improve this technology, not only by the development of H2 storage and distribution, but also through an efficient and sustainable production method. In this respect, over the last few years the European Commission has developed several activities through the technological initiative ‘Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking’ under Horizon 2020 (http://www.fch.europa.eu/). This program is a unique public-private partnership that supports research, technological development and demonstration activities in fuel cell and H2 energy technologies in Europe. Given this background, biological H2 or biohydrogen production is a feasible alternative when compared to the commonly used technologies outlined above. The biological approach has significant advantages over chemical methods since it could be performed at relatively low temperatures (25–37 °C), at atmospheric pressure and at relatively high rates (Trchounian and Trchounian, 2015). The gases produced by biological processes mostly contain hydrogen (60–90% v/v). However, different impurities like CO2, and other gases can be present in the gas mixtures. Efficient separation techniques from bioreactor headspaces for separation CO2 and SO2 have also been developed (Fan et al., 2009a). For instance CO2 is sparingly soluble in water and scrubbers, containing KOH solution, can be used to separate it from other gases (Das and Veziroǧlu, 2001). The biological production of H2 can be classified into three major categories: (1) biophotolysis of water using algae and cyanobacteria, (2) photofermentation of organic compounds by photosynthetic bacteria and (3) dark fermentative production by heterotrophic microorganisms (Hallenbeck, 2005). The theoretical yields of H2 from dark fermentations depend on the type of organism used in the fermentation (Mathews and Wang, 2009) but in general it is more efficient than photosynthetic processes. Among the most important microorganisms for H2 production by dark fermentation are facultative anaerobes such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter species (E. aerogenes and E. cloacae) and also obligate anaerobes like several Clostridium species (Goyal et al., 2013) as well as, Citrobacter or even some aerobes like Alcaligenes, Bacillus and so on (Sengupta, 1998). In addition, several of these organisms have been used in co-fermentation and mixed microbial consortiums although this strategy gave lower H2 yields due to the presence of H2 consuming bacteria. In these cases inoculum pre-treatment, such as pH and heat shock, is crucial to establish the required microbial community. In one of such studies reported by Faloye et al. (Faloye et al., 2013) Clostridium sp. were found the most represented species involved in H2 production. Nevertheless, of all the H2-producing microorganisms described in the literature, the bacterium E. coli is one of the most widely used for anaerobic fermentation due to its well-known metabolism and also because it is relatively easy to rewire its metabolic pathways through genetic engineering techniques (Atsumi and Liao, 2008; Blankschien et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2012; Clomburg and Gonzalez, 2010; Dharmadi et al., 2006; Ganesh et al., 2012; Joung et al., 2011; Maeda et al., 2008a; Nakamura and Whited, 2003; Trinh and Srienc, 2009; Valle et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2010). The interest in this field is currently increasing, as evidenced by the exponential growth in publications since 2000. For instance, a search in SCOPUS using the terms ‘hydrogen’ (physics, chemistry, environmental engineering, biochemistry, technology, etc.), ‘hydrogen and Escherichia coli’, ‘hydrogen and Escherichia coli and engineering’ and ‘genetic engineering and hydrogen” indicates an exponential growth in the last 18 years (Fig. 1 ). It noteworthy that the growth rates of publications with the terms ‘hydrogen’ versus ‘hydrogen and Escherichia coli’ have been very similar in the last ten years, although the number of publications related to engineering and E. coli to improve H2 production has increased significantly since 2000, and genetic engineering for H2 production in the last decade, which reflects the growing number of researchers interested in this topic and probably indicates a change in the paradigm of biofuel production in the near future. In anaerobic fermentative hydrogen production (FHP), numerous carbon sources such as glycerol, glucose, formate, sucrose, lactose, galactose, arabinose, fructose, gluconate, maltose, mannitol, sorbitol, trehalose, and xylose can be used (Goyal et al., 2013; Rosales-Colunga and De León Rodríguez, 2015; Trchounian, 2015; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2015). Nevertheless, in order to make H2 production by E. coli economically viable on a large-scale, organic substrates from agricultural, chemical, food or by-product wastes should be used (Trchounian, 2015). In this regard, glycerol has become an abundant and inexpensive carbon source because it is generated as a by-product in the biodiesel fuel industry (Sarma et al., 2012). This compound has been widely used in the generation of H2 by E. coli and other bacteria (Cofré et al., 2016; Dharmadi et al., 2006; Hu and Wood, 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Sarma et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2015; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2015; Valle et al., 2015a). Several advances have been made in studies that address the possibility of improving yields and productivities by using glycerol (Akhtar and Jones, 2008; Cofré et al., 2016; Henstra et al., 2007; Hu and Wood, 2010; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2015; Valle et al., 2015a; Valle et al., 2017), glucose (Maeda et al., 2007a; Seol et al., 2014; Seol et al., 2016; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2014b; Yoshida et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2011) or even both together in the same culture medium (Trchounian et al., 2011; Trchounian et al., 2014; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2013) as the main carbon sources. Glycerol is a highly reduced carbon source compared to sugars and it therefore offers an effective opportunity to obtain H2 and other reduced products by bacteria (Ganesh et al., 2012; Khanna et al., 2012). The energy content of pure glycerol is 19.0 MJ/kg, although it is only 25.30 MJ/kg for crude glycerol, probably due to the presence of methanol and traces of biodiesel (https://bit.ly/2NNZkMP). Such a high energy content in crude glycerol indicates its great potential to be an effective substrate for H2 production. However production of H2 using carbon rich containing wastes is a new and perspective strategy to meet increasing energy demand. Different types of organic wastes, including lignocellulose materials, can be used. The most important criteria for waste selection to produce H2 are its accessibility the presence of sugars (carbohydrates) or other carbon rich compounds, utilization of these sources by microbes, and, at last, its cost (Poladyan et al., 2018a). The margin for increasing the efficiency of H2 production is potentially high since, from a microbial evolutionary perspective, the low biological H2 yields in the natural strains can be attributed to the fact that microorganisms capable of FHP have developed their metabolic pathways preferentially for cell growth rather than for H2 synthesis. Therefore, the yields and productivities can be improved significantly by metabolic engineering, which eventually will depend on the carbon source used in the fermentation. For this reason, some efforts have been focused on obtaining H2 from glycerol (Cai et al., 2011; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008; Rosales-Colunga and De León Rodríguez, 2015). In this review, we describe the state of the art for the strategies used to enhance H2 production in E. coli by using glycerol and/or glucose as the main carbon source/s at different pHs although other organic wastes are also analysed."
1,Biosynthesis of H2 in E. coli,
2,Fermentation of glycerol or glucose: from carbon source to formate,"2.1 Fermentation of glycerol or glucose: from carbon source to formate H2 is formed during the anaerobic mixed-acid fermentation in which pyruvate (PYR), the final product of glycolysis, is converted into formate and acetyl-CoA, the precursors of CO2 + H2 and ethanol, respectively (Dharmadi et al., 2006). Fermentation of glycerol starts with its conversion to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) in a process that is mediated by a two-branch pathway: the oxidative branch by glycerol dehydrogenase (GldA) and dihydroxyacetone kinase enzymes (DhaKLM), and the reductive branch by glycerol kinase (GlpK) and glycerol 3-P dehydrogenase (GlpABC) enzymes. DHAP can be metabolized in the glycolysis pathway to PYR, although a unique characteristic of glycerol metabolism is that the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into PYR is coupled to DHA phosphorylation. In this process 1 NAD+ is reduced, in the assimilation of glycerol and in the synthesis of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) (Cintolesi et al., 2012), to yield 1 mol PYR per mol glycerol (Fig. 2 ). In the case of glucose fermentation, PYR is generated from glycolysis and 2 NAD+ is also reduced in the same step (conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-BPG), but the fermentation yield is 2 mol PYR per mol glucose, i.e., double that obtained with glycerol (Fig. 2). Independently of the substrate for FHP, the synthesis of formate from PYR is essential for the production of H2, which is formed concomitantly with Acetyl-CoA by pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) in microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. Acetyl-CoA is then reduced to ethanol to allow the NADH oxidation for glycolysis maintenance. PEP and PYR are also the precursors for the synthesis of other fermentative end-products such as succinate, acetate, acetolactate, lactate (Sawers and Clark, 2004), 1,2-propanediol (PDO) (Murarka et al., 2008) and even butyric acid under certain conditions (Lugg et al., 2008) (Fig. 2)."
3,From formate to H2: FHL systems and hydrogenases,"2.2 From formate to H2: FHL systems and hydrogenases One of the key elements in the strategy for improving H2 production in E. coli is to understand how the Formate Hydrogen Lyase (FHL) systems work. These multi-protein complexes operate strictly under anaerobic conditions and they are not only able to synthesize H2 and CO2 in a 1:1 M ratio by decomposition of formate, but they are also involved in H2 recycling (H2 ➔ 2H+ + e−). This is not the only way for the cell to produce H+ as it can also be formed in the oxidation of NADH (NADH ➔ NAD+ H+), which is produced during glycolysis (Das and Veziroǧlu, 2001) and influences the way in which FHL works. H2 synthesis is a process that is highly dependent on several factors such as pHout, carbon source, temperature, redox potential (Eh), presence of exogenous electron acceptors, ratios of end products and H2 concentration (Trchounian, 2015; Trchounian, 2012). These factors probably determine which FHL is more active. FHL consists of two enzyme complexes – formate dehydrogenase H (FdhH) and [NiFe] hydrogenase enzymes (Hyd) – in E. coli (Bagramyan and Trchounian, 2003; Sawers, 2005) and other facultative anaerobe microorganisms (Sinha et al., 2015). The study of H2 production has led to the discovery of multiple and reversible Hyd (Hyd-1, Hyd-2, Hyd-3 and Hyd-4) enzymes. FHL-1 is composed of Hyd-3 complex encoded by the hycABCDEFGHI operon, which is upregulated by an FhlA protein codified by the fhl gene (Self and Shanmugam, 2000). This complex is well characterized and is the main H2-producing system during glycerol and glucose fermentation at acidic pH and it has been widely described and reviewed by Trchounian's group (Trchounian, 2015; Trchounian et al., 2012; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2015). The FHL-2 system is composed of Hyd-4 and Fdh-H and it is associated with ATPase. This is the least known of all the FHL and hydrogenase enzymes but it is also able to produce H2 in both glucose- and glycerol-based media (Bagramyan et al., 2002; Mnatsakanyan et al., 2004; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2014b), although there is some controversy in this regard (Noguchi et al., 2010; Self et al., 2003; Skibinski et al., 2002) and its physiological role is not completely clear (Poladyan and Trchounian, 2009; Trchounian et al., 2012). The structures and topology of hydrogenases and FHL-1 and -2 systems and the operon that express each component are represented in Fig. 3 . The other two hydrogenases, Hyd-1 and Hyd-2, play a minor role in H2 synthesis and they are probably more related to the recycling of H2, which again depends on pH, carbon source and H2 concentration (Pinske et al., 2012), thus contributing to the reduced quinone pool (Trchounian et al., 2012). Hyd-1 is encoded by the hya operon and, despite the fact that it is not essential for anaerobic growth, it is needed to respond to the [pH]out shift from alkaline to acidic (Brøndsted and Atlung, 1994) and affects H+ translocation across the membrane. Since the proton motive force (Δp) changes during a [pH]out shift, it has been suggested that Hyd-1 is required to maintain Δp in an energy-conserving manner (Trchounian, 2015). Hyd-2 is encoded by the hyb operon, the expression is higher in alkaline media (Brøndsted and Atlung, 1994) and it is thought to operate as an oxidizing H2 enzyme under glycerol and glucose fermentation at acidic pH. However, it is involved in H2 production under glycerol fermentation at neutral and slightly alkaline pH (Trchounian and Trchounian, 2009). Several pieces of evidence suggest that either Hyd-1 or Hyd-2 operate preferentially under different conditions (Trchounian, 2015). The Hyd enzymes therefore appear to play important roles in increasing the fitness of the bacteria to survive in different environments (Trchounian et al., 2012) (Fig. 3). The physiological role of H2 production mediated by Hyd enzymes seems to involve the discharge of reducing power excess when other suitable electron acceptors, such as O2, are absent and for this reason H2-producing Hyd enzymes are rapidly inhibited by O2 (Laurinavichene et al., 2001; Lukey et al., 2010; Trchounian et al., 1998). It is interesting to consider the relationship between H2 and the H+ cycle, since Hyd enzymes have H+ translocation activity and they interact with the F0F1-ATPase, which is also involved in the H+ cycle (Rossmann et al., 1991). FHL-2 function requires catalytically competent F0F1-ATPase and it is associated with K+ uptake via the ATP-dependent TrkA transporter. In this hydrogenase the uptake of K+ is essential for H2 synthesis, since the mutation of the TrkA protein blocked the synthesis at [pH]out 7.5 on using glucose as the carbon source (Trchounian, 2015). This is a key mechanism in the generation of Δp and the regulation of [pH]in. In summary, Hyd-2 could be considered as a reversible enzyme that can contribute to H2 evolution more significantly in the absence of Hyd-3 and Hyd-1. On the other hand, the oxidizing activity Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 depends on the presence of an active F0F1-ATP synthase during growth at pH 7.5 and 5.5 with glucose or glycerol fermentation. There is an inverse correlation between Hyd-1 and -2 activity at pH (5.5 and 7.5) during fermentative growth on glucose and a direct correlation between hydrogenase activity at pH (5.5 and 7.5) during glycerol fermentation. Since the H+ gradient is essential to ATP and H2 synthesis, it seems that both Hyd-1 and -2 play an important role in energy conservation in fermenting E. coli cells (Trchounian et al., 2011). On the other hand, Trchounian's group has also carried out fermentation with a carbon mixed medium using glucose and glycerol. They found that H2 synthesis and oxidation strongly depend on pH. In this sense, during mixed carbon fermentation at pH 7.5, H2 production with glucose supplementation had similar values to that using only glucose. This may be caused by Hyd-1 with Hyd-2 H2 oxidizing activity. In contrast to that, only Hyd-2 caused H2 uptake upon growth on an only-glucose medium. In both cases the authors suggested that Hyd-3 with Hyd-4 were the responsible for H2 production (Trchounian and Trchounian, 2013). Hydrogenases activities are similar with mixed carbon fermentation at pH 6.5 (Trchounian, 2012). However at pH 5.5, H2 production was lower during mixed carbon fermentation than in cells grown only on glucose. In this case, a novel role for Hyd-4 has been proposed as can be deduced from the analysis of fhlA and fhlAhyfG mutants that revealed that not only Hyd-3 but also Hyd-4 was responsible for H2 production. However, Hyd-3 was the only producing Hyd enzyme in the cells grown only on glucose. On the other hand glycerol on mixed carbon fermentation Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 seems to affect to Hyd-3 or Hyd-4 activities, although further studies are required to better understand these interactions (Trchounian and Trchounian, 2013). Therefore the use of different concentration of glucose and glycerol in the media affect in H2 production and it was found how glucose has an inhibition effect on H2 and mixed carbon stimulatory ones at differents pHs. The effects can be explained because of Hyd enzymes activity and their changed mode might be rresponsible for the effects obtained. Moreover it is known that glucose has an inhibitory effects on hyf expression and Hyd-4 activity. It is possible that changes in fermentation and end products by carbon sources at different pHs affect Hyd enzyme activity. It has been determined that glycerol, in addition, affects Hyd-2 activity and change its mode resulting in enhanced H2 production. Besides, Hyd-3 and Hyd-4 might translocate protons through the cell membrane and with the F0F1 –ATPase determine proton motive force. The latter has been shown to maintain on lover level during glycerol fermentation and can have impact on H2 production under different conditions (Trchounian et al., 2014). Nonetheless, further studies are required to elucidate the physiological relationship between the different hydrogenases and their interaction with these factors (i.e., pH and carbon source) within the bacterial membrane. This research might help to provide a new perspective in the bioenergetics of fermentation with sole carbon or during mixed carbon sources."
4,Several environmental parameters that affect H2 production in E. coli,It can be deduced from the above discussion of FHL complexes that the environment has a marked impact on H2 production. The most influential factors are outlined below.
5,Formate transport and pH,"3.1 Formate transport and pH Formate or formic acid is a monovalent anionic substance at neutral and slightly alkaline pH and this is one of the major mixed-acid fermentation products in many obligate and facultative anaerobes. This molecule can be used for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in E. coli (Jensen et al., 2008). Formate is produced by the action of PFL and can be exported from the cytoplasm or, in the presence of terminal electron acceptors, can be eliminated by the periplasmic formate dehydrogenase oxygen-dependent (FDH—O) or nitrate-dependent (FDH—N). However, formate is re-imported to the cytoplasm and used as a substrate for H2 production by the formate dehydrogenase H-dependent (FDH—H) as a component of FHL-1 when the cells enter the late exponential growth phase or when terminal electron acceptors are absent (Sawers, 2005). As a weak acid, formate may act as an uncoupling factor that dissipates Δp and therefore leads to a decrease of [pH]out potentiates. Formate transport in E. coli is carried out by the two formate channels named FocA (member of formate-nitrite transporter family FNT), which has an important role in both the export and import of formate (Beyer et al., 2013), and the putative formate transporter FocB, which is less well characterized than FocA (Wang et al., 2009) (Fig. 3). These channels appear to control formate translocation in a pH-dependent manner. However, it should be noted that during glucose fermentation at a pH value higher than 7 the FHL-2 complex is probably responsible for H2 production, whereas when the pH is below 7 FHL-1 it is more active (Trchounian and Trchounian, 2014a). Formate can be transported across the membrane under different conditions. The FocB transporter preferentially imports the formate to produce H2 at different [pH]out with any carbon source (glucose or glycerol). However, FocA exports formate during glucose fermentation at any pH and with glycerol at pH 7.5, but it imports formate at pH values below 7 (Fan et al., 2009b; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2014a). From the results of these studies it can be deduced that H2 production during growth on different carbon sources depends on the focA and focB genes. These channels seem to control formate translocation in a pH-dependent manner and when both channels are absent it may lead to enhanced H2 production (Trchounian and Trchounian, 2014a). However, formate channels do not function in a separate way and some interactions with other proteins have been identified. A study published by Falke et al. (Falke et al., 2016) highlighted the glycyl-radical enzyme (GRE) TdcE protein as a specific interaction partner of the formate-specific channel FocA, which would play a similar role to that of PflB. Falke et al. (Falke et al., 2016) ruled out the possibility that FocA-binding is a general property of GREs and only TdcE and PflB interact with FocA."
6,"pH, hydrogenase activity and carbon source","3.2 pH, hydrogenase activity and carbon source Trchounian's group has studied extensively the dependence of hydrogenase activities on pH and their crosstalk functions (Trchounian, 2015; Trchounian et al., 2012; Trchounian et al., 2014; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2013; Trchounian and Trchounian, 2015). H2 production depends on [pH]out and carbon source (glycerol or glucose) in the culture medium and FHL systems are involved in the regulation of [pH]in (Bock and Sawers, 2006); the results can be summarized as follows and in Table 1 : (1) At [pH]out 5.5 during glycerol or glucose fermentation, hydrogenases Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 seem to have similar functions in oxidizing hydrogen but Hyd-3 is involved in H2 production, which has the highest rate when H2 uptake by Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 showed low activity. When glucose or mixed carbon media (glucose and glycerol) are used, not only Hyd-3 but also Hyd-4 is responsible for H2 production. In contrast, Hyd-3 is the only producing enzyme in cells grown only with glycerol as carbon source. (2) At pH 6.5 Hyd-3 is the main H2-producing enzyme during glycerol fermentation, although it might operate in a reverse direction and have significant H2 uptake activity with glucose. Hyd-2 and Hyd-1 are involved in H2 production in glycerol-containing media but operate in oxidizing mode in culture media that contain both glucose and formate. However, in the case of mixed carbon fermentation Hyd-2 and Hyd-1 have H2 oxidizing activity and then Hyd-3 and Hyd-4 are suggested to be responsible for H2 production. (3) At pH 7.5 Hyd-3 with glycerol shows H2 uptake activity but Hyd-2 and Hyd-1 are involved in H2 production in glycerol-containing media, as described for pH 6.5. However in the case of glucose media Hyd-2 is the only responsible for H2 uptake and Hyd-3 and Hyd-4 are suggested to be responsible for H2 production on glucose. In mixed carbon media fermentation the effects is likely the same observed at pH 6.5. T. K. Wood's group (Maeda et al., 2018) have also recently reviewed hydrogenase activities in engineered strains, coming to similar conclusions for most of the hydrogenases roles described by Trchounian's group, although they found several differences. For instance, they proposed that Hyd-1 has not significant effect on glycerol fermentation and Hyd-4 has not significant effect on H2 production neither using glucose nor glycerol. These different results may be due to differences in culture medium composition, since Wood's group has traditionally used a glucose-complex medium at pH 6.8 (Maeda et al., 2018) (Rachman et al., 1997) which could contain trace elements, metals, and other salts not included in the Trchounian's defined medium. These controversial results suggest that a deeper understanding of the biological functions of the most uncharacterized E. coli hydrogenase Hyd-4 is required to facilitate further development of an engineered E. coli strain capable of enhancing bacterial H2 production. For instance, this complex may be very dependent on formate availability, since minimal salt medium (MSM) containing glycerol and formate supplementation activate the H2 production role of Hyd-2 and Hyd-4 at pH 7.5 (Trchounian et al., 2017a). Hyd-enzymes activity is not only affected by pH and carbon source but also by the concentration of some heavy metals are required as cofactor, since they are (Ni—Fe)-dependent enzymes. In this sense, (Trchounian et al., 2017b) described that the addition Mo is essential for FHL activity and that Ni, Mo and Fe ions alone and their mixtures at low concentrations stimulated bacterial biomass and H2 production yields upon glycerol but not glucose fermentation and in acidic conditions (pH 5.5 and 6.5)."
7,H2 and CO2 partial pressure,"3.3 H2 and CO2 partial pressure H2 is produced under strictly anaerobic conditions and studies carried out in E. coli have generally been performed in closed vials with headspace, although in several cases it has been reported that headspace pressure can have a negative effect on the synthesis of H2, theoretically by the recycling operating mode of H2 for Hyd-1 and/or Hyd-2 (Maeda et al., 2008a). Therefore, low partial pressure fermentation is often applied to enhance H2 production, as described in several studies (Dharmadi et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2006; Maeda et al., 2008a; Mizuno et al., 2000). The concentration of CO2 also has a negative effect on the H2 production rate and yield because the synthesis of succinate consumes CO2 and PYR via OAA synthesis. This latter pathway competes with the synthesis of formate and therefore H2 production decreases – as a consequence, rapid gas removal and separation of H2 are essential to increase the production. In contrast to this (Maeda et al., 2018) has recently proposed that CO2 is a also a critical factor that can positively affect H2 production and cell growth because the FHL system is an acidic dependent enzyme which catalyzes formate to CO2 and H2. CO2 can be freely converted into bicarbonate, which lowers cytosolic pH. Therefore, the presence of CO2 in the headspace improves the metabolism of glycerol helping to maintain acidic conditions (Maeda et al., 2018). However, pH has also a high impact on Hyd1,2 and 4 activies and in some genetic backgrounds or culture conditions, an alkalyne pH could impair H2 production."
8,Metabolic engineering strategies for improving the synthesis of H2,"Metabolically engineered microbial strains can give higher yields of target products for biotechnological applications. Different strategies for metabolic engineering have been carried out in the last 10 years with several microorganisms, although E. coli is the most commonly used for improving H2 production. Metabolic pathways in E. coli have been widely studied (Blattner et al., 1997), but there are still some gaps in our knowledge about H2 production. For instance, very few studies have focused on the influence of the carbon source in H2 production. In this sense, several recent studies have shown how the manipulation of certain genes can be beneficial for H2 production using glucose as the carbon source but they do not have the same effect on using glycerol and may even have the opposite effect. For example, it has been reported that Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 are H2-consuming enzymes during glucose metabolism, whereas they are H2-producing enzymes in the presence of glycerol at neutral and slightly alkaline pH (Trchounian et al., 2011). In addition, anaerobic growth with glycerol is somewhat lower than with glucose (Hu and Wood, 2010). Given the advances in the knowledge of metabolomics and genetic manipulation techniques, the strategies for improving H2 in E. coli have evolved. In the past, genetic modifications were achieved through random processes such as exposure to ultraviolet light, chemical mutagenesis etc., but nowadays genetic engineering is widely used to obtain engineered strains with higher productivities (Maeda et al., 2012). With the help of these new techniques, and based on the wide availability of metabolic information on E. coli, several metabolic engineering strategies to improve H2 production can be designed a priori (Manish et al., 2007). It should be noted, however, that genetic engineering is not always fruitful, as undesirable effects are often encountered in the engineered organisms (Colletti et al., 2011). There is a need for an extensive analysis and detailed understanding of metabolic fluxes and their regulatory circuits that lead to H2 formation. It is important to have a fundamental knowledge of how the metabolic pathway flux responds to varying genetic and environmental perturbations and whether the pathways can be deliberately redirected towards H2 synthesis rather than to the production of unwanted metabolites. The state of the art of metabolic engineering in E. coli for H2 production on using glycerol or glucose or other carbon sources is reviewed below and the most important strategies and improvement of yield and productivities respect to the wild type values reported to date are described and summarized in Table 2."
9,Screening/high-throughput screening,"4.1 Screening/high-throughput screening Screening and high-throughput screening methods can be useful to find new phenotypes of H2-producer knock out strains or potential genes to be overexpressed, as well as to engineer further strains to improve yields and productivities. Mohd et al. (Mohd Yusoff et al., 2013) reported four pseudogenes involved in H2 metabolism with important roles in cell physiology in a screening of 3985 Escherichia coli mutants from the Keio Collection (Baba et al., 2006) by using H2 chemochromic membranes. In another screening of 150 single knock out mutants from the same collection, 12 novel strains with enhanced yields for H2 and/or ethanol production were detected in cells grown in a glycerol-based medium by analyzing H2 and ethanol production by gas chromatography (Table 2B) (Baba et al., 2006; Valle et al., 2015a). In the same work, the knock out genes that most significantly improved the parameters evaluated (including gnd and tdcE genes) were combined and the resultant quintuple mutant significantly increased the molar yields of H2 production and glycerol consumption. Barahona et al. (Barahona et al., 2016) suggested that there is a limitation in the discovery or synthesis of better H2-producing enzymes due to the absence of methods for the high-throughput screening of H2 production in biological systems. In an effort to overcome this drawback, they engineered a natural H2-sensing system of Rhodobacter capsulatus to direct the emission of LacZ-dependent fluorescence in response to the nitogrenase-produced H2. This system was used in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometry to screen large libraries of nitrogenase Fe-protein variants generated by random mutagenesis. This method was used to select an H2-overproducing Fe-protein variants lacking 40% of the wild type amino acid sequence, and subsequently microbial H2 production was improved by using directed evolution of nitrogenases and hydrogenases in the selected protein variants (Barahona et al., 2016). This strategy could be adapted to E. coli in order to improve H2 production by combining mutagenesis and high throughput screening."
10,Mutagenesis of competitive pathways,"4.2 Mutagenesis of competitive pathways Several end-products synthesized in the mixed-acid fermentation, such as lactate, acetate, ethanol and succinate, must be exported out from the cell in order to maintain the NADH/NAD+ balance and intracellular pH. Since these metabolites are reduced molecules, their syntheses are presumably competitive pathways of H2 production. Therefore, the removal of the synthesis of one or more of these end-products should theoretically result in an increased flux towards H2 synthesis. This strategy has been applied to several reported strains (Sawers and Clark, 2004). • Lactate. Deletion of the lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldh) helps to drain PYR flux towards H2 (Table 2A and Table 2B ), although this occurs only when the medium is acidic, since this condition stimulates the formation of lactate (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2012). • Succinate is another end-product whose synthesis can be reduced by knocking out the fumarate reductase (FRD) operon (frdABCD) responsible for the conversion of fumarate to succinate. This would increase intracellular PYR and therefore H2 production. Several publications have concerned the use of single and double frd knock out genes that improve H2 production in glucose- and glycerol-based media (Table 2A). However, the improvement surprisingly varies significantly between the single knock outs (Valle et al., 2015b) and the multiple mutant (Valle et al., 2017), thus indicating that each FRD subunit may have different roles, with H2 production being more favorable when FrdB and FrdC subunits are deleted. • Ethanol. Blocking the synthesis of ethanol by inactivating alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE) severely impaired H2 formation and cell growth when glycerol was employed as the carbon source (Murarka et al., 2008; Tran et al., 2014). This finding indicates that the synthesis of ethanol is essential to maintain the redox balance and also to allow the synthesis of formate and Acetyl-CoA. • Acetate production can be avoided by removing acetate-producing enzymes such as AckA-PtA (acetate kinase, phosphate acetyl-transferase) (Seol et al., 2014)or PoxB (pyruvate oxidase) (Murarka et al., 2008), although deletion of the poxB gene did not increase H2 synthesis because this mutation reduced cell viability (Tran et al., 2014). • Butyrate is synthesized from acetyl-CoA via crotonyl-CoA. Despite the fact that this metabolite has been detected in the culture under particular growth conditions (Rosales-Colunga and De León Rodríguez, 2015), strategies for removing butyrate have not been used to date, probably because its production is relatively low. • 1,2-Propanediol is synthesized by methylglyoxal synthase (MgsA) from DHAP and it has been reported that the single knock out strain for the gene of this enzyme increases slightly the production of H2 in glycerol media (Tran et al., 2014) (Table 2A). • The conversion of PYR into acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by the PYR dehydrogenase complex (PDH) under aerobic conditions, but in anaerobic conditions PYR is transformed into acetyl-CoA and formate by PYR formate lyase (PFL), which is essential for H2 synthesis. However, under microaerobic conditions the two enzymes can be functional (Sawers and Clark, 2004). Despite PDH operon genes (aceEF, lpd) having low expression levels in anaerobic conditions, the activity of this enzyme could be a competitive pathway in formate synthesis and therefore deletion of the aceE subunit resulted in an increased H2 yield with a glucose-based medium (Maeda et al., 2007a). However, significant improvements were not observed on using glycerol (Tran et al., 2014). • Conversion of PEP into OAA by the anaplerotic enzyme PEP carboxylase (Ppc) can be considered a competitive reaction since it diverts the C3 compound towards succinate. For this reason, the knock out of this gene increases H2 productivity significantly (Tran et al., 2014) (Table 2A). • Hydrogenases (Hyd-1, −2, −3, −4) are the key controlling enzymes in the synthesis or oxidation of H2 and their function depends on pH and carbon sources, as described previously. Thus, removal of the H2-consuming activity of Hyd-1 and/or Hyd-2 by knocking out the large subunit of both enzymes (ΔhyaBΔhybC) in an acidic culture medium is a strategy that has been successfully employed by several groups using both glycerol- (Maeda et al., 2008b) and glucose-based media (Ghosh and Hallenbeck, 2010; Maeda et al., 2007a; Maeda et al., 2008a; Seol et al., 2014; Seol et al., 2016). In addition, the overexpression of Hyd-3, the most important enzyme that forms FHL-1, in FHP when glycerol is used at pH 7.5 increases H2 production. Hence, the FHL expression may be manipulated by overexpression of fhlA (Commission) or deletion of the hycA gene that encoded a repressor of FhlA expression (Penfold et al., 2003; Yoshida et al., 2005). Interestingly, a combination of fhlA overexpression and disruption of hycA did lead to a 2.8-fold increase in the H2 formation rate (Yoshida et al., 2006) (Table 2A, B). There are two additional formate dehydrogenases encoded by fdnG (a subunit of nitrogen-dependent formate dehydrogenase-N) and fdoG genes (a subunit of oxygen-dependent formate dehydrogenase-O) that consume formate but do not produce H2. However, the deletion of fdoG did not improve the H2 yield in a glycerol-based medium and the fdnG mutant showed only a moderate improvement in H2 production (Maeda et al., 2007a; Rossmann et al., 1991). Other enzymes or regulator proteins involved in formate consumption that may compete with the synthesis of H2 are outlined below: (1) Nitrate reductase A (whose α-subunit is encoded by the narG gene) consumes formate in the conversion of nitrate into nitrite by using electrons produced from formate by FDH—N. Deletion of the narG gene leads to a very modest H2 productivity but in combination with other mutations the H2 productivity increases significantly (Maeda et al., 2007a; Tran et al., 2014). (2) FNR protein is a global DNA-binding transcriptional regulator that stimulates the transcription of several genes required for fermentation and anaerobic respiration and represses others like hyf operon, which encoded Hyd-4 (Salmon et al., 2003). As a consequence, deletion of the fnr gene leads to a three-fold increase in HyfR expression as the activator of hyf operon. (3) The NarL protein is a global transcription repressor for the genes of FhlA, PFL, and nickel transporter nik operon. Inactivation of the narL gene led to a two-fold increase in the molar yield of H2, with similar growth to that of the wild-type strain (Fan et al., 2009a). (4) Formate channels (FocA and FocB) appear to control formate translocation in a pH-dependent manner and the absence of both formate channels may lead to enhanced FHP (Trchounian and Trchounian, 2014a). Several strategies for metabolic engineering by manipulating these protein transporters with glycerol have been applied to the ΔfocAΔfocB double mutant strain (Table 2A). However, the deletion of focA in multiple mutant strains did not increase H2 formation and, indeed, it was even lower with respect to the wild type strain. These results indicate that the formate transporter is necessary for an increase in hydrogen production in these mutant strains (Tran et al., 2014) and this finding is consistent with those reported previously by Maeda et al. (Maeda et al., 2007a) for the conversion of glucose into hydrogen."
11,Adaptive evolution,"4.3 Adaptive evolution Adaptive evolution is a set of environmentally induced mutations that confer growth advantages to the cell (Foster, 2007). In this strategy, an organism is subjected to serial or continuous cultivation for many generations under non-optimal conditions in order to select fitter genetic variants (Cooper et al., 2003). The specific growth rate in glycerol medium of the wild type E. coli strain – and even in derivate mutant strains – is quite low compared with that in glucose, which results in low H2 productivity (Murarka et al., 2008). In an effort to overcome this limitation, Hu and Wood (2010) obtained an efficient glycerol-utilizing strain by both adaptive evolution and chemical mutagenesis using a selection method based on increased growth on glycerol. The improved strain produced twenty times more H2 in glycerol medium than the wild type strain. It was also found that the activity of several enzymes related to glycerol consumption were increased 4-fold with respect to the wild type strain, and a whole-transcriptome study revealed that several competitive pathways were repressed in that mutant."
12,Homologous and heterologous expression,"4.4 Homologous and heterologous expression Overexpression of E. coli native genes (homologous expression) or those from other species (heterologous expression) has been used to improve H2 production in E. coli. The heterologous expression offers the advantages of obtaining more efficient enzyme activities based on kinetic parameters (Valle et al., 2017). The main strategies reported in the literature are described below: (1) Homologous and heterologous hydrogenase-encoding genes. Several heterologous hydrogenases and hydrogenase-related genes have been expressed in E. coli: • The expression of HydA from Clostridium butyricum improved H2 productivity by around a factor of two (Subudhi and Lal, 2011) and its overexpresion in an isolated glycerol-consuming E. coli SS1 strain increased 20% H2 yield (Soo et al., 2017). • The expression of HydAEFG from Clostridium together with the expression of a putative PYR flavodoxin/ferrodoxin oxidorectuase (YdbK) from E. coli increased H2 production by 1.5 times (Akhtar and Jones, 2009). • The expression of the hydrogenase HoxEFUYH from the cyanobacteria Synechocystis in a Hyd-1 and -2 E. coli mutant gave rise to a 41-fold higher production (Maeda et al., 2007b). • Expression of the NADPH-dependent hydrogenases from Clostridium sp. and Bacillus subtilis together with the increment of the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ ratio via overexpression of glpX and zwf genes (which encoded glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase). This combination of heterologous expression of NAPDH-dependent hydrogenases and autologous gluconeogenesis and PPP enzymes led to an increase in the H2 yield by 3.5-fold (Kim et al., 2011). The strategy of NAD(P)H generation by activation of PPP, have also been performed by homologous overexpression of zwf and gnd in a hyd, ldhA and frd multiple mutant obtaining 1.32 mol H2 per mol glucose (Seol et al., 2016) or by heterologous overexpression of zwf and gnd from Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Gluconobacter oxydans respectively with pgi (phosphoglucose isomerase) inactivation obtaining in this case 1.74 mol H2 per mol glucose (Sundara Sekar et al., 2017). • Another effect of the heterologous expression of hydrogenase genes is the activation of the autologous E. coli FHL-1 complex, as described by (Jo and Cha, 2015). This group detected the activation of the FHL complex by the expression of HoxGK hydrogenase from Hydrogenovibrio marinus in BL21(DE3) strain. The main responsible of this activation is a signal peptide from the HoxK protein. This peptide is essential for FHL activation that is mediated by interaction with membrane component(s) for protein translocation that directly or indirectly affects FHL. (2) Anaplerotic enzymes involved in carbon redirection towards H2 production. The human mitochondrial GTP-dependent PEP carboxykinase (hPEPCK-M) that catalyzes more efficiently the conversion of OAA to PEP has been used due to its kinetic parameters, the use of an energy donor (GTP) and non-allosteric regulation. That heterologous expression was found to enhance significantly the H2 yield and glycerol consumption (Valle et al., 2017). (3) Overexpression of transcription factors. The FHL complex is composed of FDH-H and Hyd-3. The biosynthesis of FHL and PFL are up-regulated by the action of several transcriptional regulators, including the global transcriptional factors Fnr, among other proteins. The transcription of the fhl regulon is controlled by the primary and secondary transcriptional activators FhlA and ModE. The biosynthesis of FDH-H also requires the expression of the selC gene, which encodes tRNA for the incorporation of selenocysteine to FHD—H. Therefore, the homologous overexpression of these encoded protein genes, fhlA, pfnr, pselC and pmodE, has led to an improved H2 production in a glucose-based medium (Fan et al., 2009b)."
13,Protein engineering,"4.5 Protein engineering Protein engineering to improve H2 production by increasing catalytic reactions is a feasible approach. For instance, the E. coli Hyd-3 large subunit (HycE) has been modified and this enhanced the FHL complex formation. The method used by Maeda et al. (Maeda et al., 2008b) was based on mutagenesis of the HycE protein by an error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR) and employed a host that lacked hydrogenase activity due to hyaB hybC hycE mutations. Seven enhanced HycE variants were obtained and the best contained eight mutations and showed a 17-fold higher H2-producing activity than wild type HycE. Furthermore, shuffling of the DNA sequences of the three most active HycE variants provided a variant that increased H2 production 23-fold. This was the first engineered hydrogenase obtained by random mutation and it seems to strengthen the interaction between the large and small subunits, thus enhancing the flow of electrons for formate dehydrogenase-H (Maeda et al., 2008b). The same method was also used to engineer the σ54 transcriptional factor FhlA, which activates transcription of fdhF, and the hyc, hyp and hydN-hypF operons. The FhlA133 variant isolated by Sanchez-Torres et al. (Sanchez-Torres et al., 2009) gave a four-fold increase in H2 production and the whole-transcriptome and promoter reporter analysis revealed that FhlA133 improved H2 production by increasing transcription of all of the genes activated by FhlA (FHL complex). Surprisingly, fhlA133 also induced four oxidative-stress proteins and 12-stress related genes during anaerobic fermentation. This finding suggests that an increased FHL expression affects the cell physiology and that an increased expression of anti-stress proteins could probably facilitate H2 synthesis (Sanchez-Torres et al., 2009)."
14,Metabolic flux analysis (MFA),"4.6 Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) The way in which anaerobic bacteria regulate flux distribution under different environmental conditions remains to be elucidated. In this regard, the characterization of metabolic fluxes is very important to design metabolic engineering strategies as the flux is a fundamental parameter of cell physiology (Cai et al., 2011). Flux balance analysis (FBA) was used to determine intracellular fluxes from substrate uptake to product formation rates by applying metabolite balancing, which is based on the stoichiometry of metabolic reactions (Varma and Palsson, 1994). The implementation of this approach with proteomic, metabolomics and transcriptomic data led to the concept of metabolic flux analysis (MFA). This approach has been applied to optimize the production of lysine, acetate, and ethanol. However, MFA for H2 production has only attracted attention in recent years (Cai et al., 2011) and only Manish et al. (Manish et al., 2007) have reported the theoretical capability of the microorganism to produce H2. They used existing experimental data to calculate fluxes in a batch culture and they commented on the limitations in the yield of H2. MFA was also used to determine the feasible operating space for H2 production against the varying yields of other metabolites. This kind of study has helped to show that ethanol and acetate – but not succinate or lactate – are necessary for H2 production (Manish et al., 2007). It is interesting to note that this deduction was corroborated by experimental results (Murarka et al., 2008; Tran et al., 2014)."
15,Bioprocess optimization for hydrogen production,In this section the use of waste materials as alternative carbon sources and the modeling and optimization of relevant parameters for the bioprocess using E. coli are reviewed (Table 2C ).
16,Utilization of waste materials,"5.1 Utilization of waste materials The use of waste materials for renewable energy supply, such as biological H2 production is a novel and interesting strategy because implies the use of an available and cheap carbon sources (Morsy and Ibrahim, 2016). However, organic wastes are not easily used by most of the microorganisms and they cannot be directly applied for H2 production. That is why it is necessary to develop and apply technologies for pre-treatment and processing of the waste (Poladyan et al., 2018a). The waste materials used for H2 production reported so far are the following: 5.1.1 Crude glycerol Most of the metabolic engineering studies for biological H2 production in E. coli has been performed with pure glycerol in order to prevent microbial growth inhibition due to the presence of impurities. But it has also been reported the use of crude glycerol as waste material using also a co-culture with Enterobacter sp. In the study (Maru et al., 2016) reported that E. coli CECT432 strain performed best with a H2 productivity of 69.1 mM and a co-culture of this strain with a selected Enterobacter spH1 showed a 3.1-fold higher H2 productivity from pure glycerol and higher biomass production. In this study waste glycerol from biodiesel was characterized and it was found to consist mainly by glycerol and water, with 4.8% ash content and non-glycerol organic matter (NGOM) 7.2%. With this waste glycerol, a maximum H2 yield of 1.53 mol/mol glycerol was obtained. These yields are the highest reported at that moment using mesophilic strains without any glycerol purification step. The ability to produce H2 with any prior purification is attractive because it avoids extra costs in the process. Another interesting study in a lab and pilot-scales reported by (Cofré et al., 2016) used crude glycerol from a biodiesel production by using E. coli MG1655 wild type strain in batch and fed-batch operating modes. In this case the crude extract contained a high proportion of glycerol (83.3%) and very low proportion of ash 4.9% and NGOM 3.34%. The comparison of H2 yields in batch fermentation between pure and crude glycerol revealed no differences in H2 yields. In Fed-batch conditions H2 production increased with exponential feed, rising up to 782 mmol H2 with 62.8 g/L exponential feed crude glycerol in a 5.5 L bioreactor and 449.18 mmol H2 in 200 L pilot-scale bioreactor. These results revealed that a fed-batch mode under exponential feeding regime is a promising strategy to increase H2 concomitantly with ethanol production using crude glycerol. The reported yields obtained in this work were in the same range of other reported studies with genetically modified strains at lab scale. 5.1.2 Organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) H2 production by dark fermentation can simultaneously achieve dual benefits i.e. waste treatment as well as biofuel production. Several types of substrate has been utilized through anaerobic digestion such as food wastes, sugarcane straw, kitchen waste, fruits and vegetables waste, brown algae, organic waste and organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The OFMSW is highly degradable, thus anerobic fermentation of OFMSW can be one of the promising methods to generate H2 as it is abundant and free of cost. In a recent study was described the effect of amino acids on H2 production from OFMSW by using co-culture of facultative anerobes E. coli and E. aerogenes showing that H2 production was positively affected by each amino acid (Sharma and Melkania, 2018). 5.1.3 Cellulose and lignocellulosic material Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant carbohydrate in nature, and also one of the most important renewable sources. Among degradation technology, enzymatic hydrolysis is an environmentally friendly and effective technique. However, the lack of enzymes or microbes which can efficiently deconstruct plant polysaccharides represents a major bottleneck (Pang et al., 2017). E. coli cannot naturally digest nor breakdown these resistant materials, and therefore pre-treatment is mandatory and several strategies have been used. One of them is the isolation of different kinds of cellulolytic bacteria from different environments. In the study reported by (Pang et al., 2017) an E. coli strain ZH-4 with cellulose-degrading and hemicellulose-degrading activity was isolated from bovine rumen and three kinds of cellulase activities, exoglucanase, endoglucanase, and β-glucosidase activites were detected in the fermentation supernatant which has special properties to cellulose degradation in comparison to normal E. coli with a production of ethanol and H2 from corn straw. This strain not only had a self-contained complete cellulase system but also secreted these enzymes outside the cells obtaining 4.71 mL H2 /g corn straw with cellulose degradation ratio of 14.30% and hemicellulose degradation ratio of 11.39% (Pang et al., 2017). Other waste material used with E. coli reported by (Poladyan et al., 2018b) is brewery spent grains (BSG) that is one of the by-product of brewery production, that contains principally cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin; and also a high protein content together with the xylose, glucose and arabinose which are the most abundant monosaccharides found in BSG. For growth and H2 production of E. coli upon utilization of BSG hydrolysate (BSGH) an optimial pretreatment methods of BSG to design optional conditions was performed. In this study Hyd-3 and Hyd-4 were characterized as the responsible for H2 production, whereas Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 deletion led to a stimulation of H2 yield. 5.1.4 Molasses and rotten dates Other strategy is the enzymatic hydrolisis of sucrose using invertase enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is shown an alternative of using sucrose from waste materials concomitantly with H2 production by E. coli HD701 strain (with deletion of HycA, repressor of FHL complex) in a single stage. In this work because of E. coli is unable to metbolize sucrose, the invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) was extracted and purified from S. cerevisiae and was added to 1 L fermenter medium and the evolution of H2 appeared after 2 h from the start time of fermentation and continued for a period of 30 h with a maximum yield of 0.48 and 0.49 mol/mol of glucose when molasses and rotten dates fruits were used as substrates respectively. This methodology can avoid the acid hydrolyzed sucrose that requires a high concentration of HCl and consumes energy in contrast the hydrolysis by invertase, would be easier with less biotechnological steps and requires less energy (Morsy and Ibrahim, 2016)."
17,Modeling and optimization of environmental variables for biological H2 production,"5.2 Modeling and optimization of environmental variables for biological H2 production The environmental conditions may be optimized for a given engendered strain. H2 production has been used as a response variable in order to reduce the number of experiments required to optimize the conditions for maximum yields. For this, biological production rate of H2 production and its molar yield, like many other processes, are a function of several variables, including medium composition, pH, temperature, substrate concentration and many more. In this context, modeling and analysis could be used to determine the optimal values of the most relevant parameters (Nath and Das, 2011). For instance, a 3K full factorial Box–Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM) have been employed for experimental design. Ghosh et al. (Ghosh and Hallenbeck, 2010) applied this methodology and obtained a maximum molar H2 yield on using glucose under the optimal conditions at pH 6.5 in the ΔhyaBΔhybCΔldhAΔfhlC mutant strain (Rosales-Colunga et al., 2010). Rosales-Colunga et al. (Rosales-Colunga et al., 2010) optimized pH, temperature and substrate concentration of cheese, by using a strain deficient in a protein repressor of Fhl activator factor (HycA) and lactose transporter (LacI). The maximum yield obtained was comparable to the yield achieved in other H2 production processes with Clostridium sp. or mixed cultures (Table 2B). Another study in which this method was used focused on optimizing culture media by using design of experiment with Placket-Burman method to improve the growth rate, in order to obtain higher productivities of H2 and ethanol and for scaling up the process (Cofré et al., 2012). Another method reported is the Modified Gompertz model that was used to analyze cumulative and rate H2 production in fermentation of co-culture of E. coli and E. aerogenes with OFMSW as described in the previous section 5.1. With this method it was detected that the amino acids implemented in the media affect positively in H2 production (Sharma and Melkania, 2018)."
18,Effect of carbon source and redox balance in H2 synthesis,"Independently of the carbon source used, there are several genes that are involved in fermentative pathways, H2 synthesis, TCA-reductive and fermentative pathways whose deletions have been widely reported and constitute the main targets for the metabolic redirection in engineered strains. For instance, the deletions of the genes of hydrogenases-1 and -2 (subunits ∆hyaB and ∆hybC, respectively), the repressor protein of FhlA (∆hycA), the fumarate reductase (∆frdABC), the lactate dehydrogenase (∆ldhA), the α-formate dehydrogenase-N (∆fdnG), and the phosphate acetyltransferase (Pta) (underlined and bold in the gray square in Fig. 2), have been widely used to increase the H2 production rate using glucose or glycerol. However, not all of these strategies have been tested using both carbon sources and there are some mutations that have only been assayed with glycerol or glucose. In this sense, there are many mutation strategies, such as deletion of acetate kinase (∆ackA), pyruvate oxidase (∆pox), pyruvate dehydrogenase (∆aceEF), formate dehydrogenase-O (∆fdoG), phosphofructokinase (∆pfkA), that have been tested in glucose-containing media but not in a glycerol C source that improves H2 synthesis (marked as regular font in the gray square in Fig. 2). On the other hand, some deletion strategies have worked in glycerol but not in glucose media, for instance ∆rpiA, ∆gldA, ∆tdcB, ∆tdcE, ∆narG, ∆mgsA, ∆gatZ. Nevertheless, it has been reported than some mutations do not have the same final effect and even give rise to an opposite result, as is the case of the gluconate dehydrogenase gene (∆gnd), which has a positive effect when glycerol is used but its overexpression enhanced the production of H2 when glucose was used (marked in gray and also in the red square in Fig. 2). This differences in the engineering strategies on using glycerol or glucose are probably a consequence of the numerous up- and down-regulation metabolic pathways caused by the main regulator protein involved being a transcriptional dual regulator (CRP) (cAMP receptor protein) that regulates the expression of over 180 genes. Many of these genes are involved the central carbon pathways and are also regulated by the cra protein, which carries out a glycolytic flux-dependent process. This latter process is determined by the concentration of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate synthesized in glucose fermentation, which is the molecular effector of the cra gene (Kochanowski et al., 2013). The absence of a rapidly metabolizable carbon source, such as glucose, results in an elevated level of cAMP and subsequently cAMP-CRP increases, which in turn causes catabolite repression. This protein also regulates the catabolism of secondary carbon sources (Soberón-Chávez et al., 2017) and could be related to the enhancement in H2 synthesis reported for several mutant strains related to amino acid metabolism, antibiotic resistance (Table 2A) or pseudogenes (Table 2B). The strategies outlined above do not always work when either glucose or glycerol are used as the C source. This could be due to the redox balance NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+, which must be maintained at certain levels for an efficient synthesis of formate and thus H2. For instance, the deletion of alcohol dehydrogenase (∆adhE), because it is a competitive pathway that consumes 2 NADH to produce ethanol, did not improve H2 production. Furthermore, in the case of malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) and malic enzymes (MaeA, MaeB) that use NAD(P)H the synthesis of H2 was even impaired (Valle et al., 2015b). The function of these enzymes and the regulation of the hydrogenase operon's gene expression are involved in maintaining the redox and energy balances and are connected to the proton motive force (PMF) in the intermembrane space. On the other hand, there are heterologous NAD(P)H-dependent hydrogenases that have been overexpressed in E. coli (Table 2) and the engineered strains required a higher NAD(P)H/NADP+ ratio to improve H2 production. This has been achieved by overexpressing enzyme genes involved in NADPH production. The carbon source and redox cofactors are two key factors to take into account in the bacterial physiology for improving H2 synthesis."
19,Conclusions,"In this review the most relevant metabolic engineering strategies for enhancing H2 production in E. coli are described. This revision of the state of the art in this field may be useful to design new strategies for engineering new E. coli producer strains and therefore help to scale-up H2 production using this commonly used bacteria. Among all of the strategies reported, the main genetic manipulations by gene deletion(s) and/or overexpression(s) are the following: (1) deletion of competitive pathways of formate synthesis, such as Hyd-1 (∆hyaB), Hyd-2 (∆hybC), together with ∆fdnG, ∆ldhA, ∆frdBC, and ∆pta; (2) Upregulation of hyc operon, which expresses the hydrogenase Hyd-3 by deletion of the repressor HycA or by overexpression of the transcriptional factor FhlA. These two strategies have been widely applied using different carbon sources (glucose, glycerol or waste materials). Other strategies, however have been applied depending on the carbon source: (3) overexpression of enzymes involved in glycerol assimilation (GldA) and (4) overexpression of homologous or heterologous enzymes for rewiring of carbon flux such as Zwf or Gnd from E. coli or the human PEPCK. It could also be very useful to implement this information in modeling (MFA) or in silico studies in order to help to understand and predict the optimized pathways to enhance the production of the target product. Although MFA is a suitable method for modeling, there is still a great deal of information that can be obtained from multiomic platforms, which are very valuable tools to design engineered strains that might be used as a microbial cell factory for H2 production."
