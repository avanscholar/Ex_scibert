0,Introduction,"Energy is the foundation of human production activities as well as social and economic development. Now, the severe energy shortage and excessive reliance on fossil fuels have caused a series of environment issues, which have affected the normal life of human beings [1,2]. Many scientists are pushing ahead with research on the renewable and environment-friendly energy so as to effectively solve these global issues. The solar energy is really inexhaustible source, which will likely play a crucial role in the development of new energy sources in some extent [3,4]. Hydrogen, a special energy carrier, is clean and, in practice, can be generated by photocatalytic water splitting. This means that the hydrogen can be obtained through the conversion of solar energy. The metal oxide semiconductors are considered to be the most promising photocatalysts in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting [5–7]. Since Fujishima and Honda firstly found semiconductor titanium dioxide (TiO2) could be used as catalyst for hydrogen production in 1972, up to now, it has been attracted considerable attentions in some areas such as photosensitive solar cells, nonlinear optical applications and waste water recovery [8–10]. TiO2 has many outstanding advantages, such as non-toxicity, rich source and corrosion resistance, but it also has some drawbacks including high recombination rates of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and large band-gap. Particularly, the recombination rate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs is faster than the rate of chemical interaction between TiO2 and sacrificial agent, reducing the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of TiO2 [11,12]. Hence, searching superior method to improve transfer efficiency photo-induced charge carrier in photocatalyst is necessary. Combination of two different semiconductors and metal ion doping has been considered to be valid methods for separating photo-generated electrons (e−) and hole (h+), and thereby enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen production activity [13–15]. In addition, metal ion doping also can effectively broaden the range of the optical response. It is assumed that a more effective Z-scheme photocatalytic system would be formed if the two methods of different semiconductor combination and metal ion doping are used in conjunction. Among the numerous photocatalysts, tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5), as a remarkable semiconductor photocatalyst, has been considered to be almost comparable to the landmark photocatalyst of TiO2 owing to its excellent optical properties characteristic [16–19]. In this context, we would like to report the composite Z-scheme photocatalyst that comprises of wide band-gap semiconductor TiO2 with more negative conduction band (CB) and the other wide band-gap semiconductor Ta2O5 with more positive valence band (VB). However, the disadvantage of conventional Z-scheme is that the electrons (e−) flow rate is slow and lacks a conductive channel. In order to promote the effective transfer of photo-generated electrons (e−), it has been reported that the existence of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) and graphene served as conductive passageway to effectively enhance the recombination efficiency of electrons (e−) and hole (h+) [20,21]. However, the introduction of conductive channels often increases the operating distance of electrons (e−) and hole (h+). To address this issue, for the first time, we doped different metal ions into the bases of TiO2 and Ta2O5, respectively, to form a composite center of circular redox reaction. In general, the doping of transition metal ions (Mn, Co, Ni, Fe and V) can significantly widen light response range of wide band-gap photocatalysts and enhance the visible-light photocatalytic activity [22–26]. In addition, the bimetallic co-doping (Ni-Cu, Zn-Fe and Cr-Nb) into catalyst has also been proved to be an effective strategy for charge separation [27–31]. Specifically, the bimetallic co-doping couple of Fe3+ and V5+ is of great interest due to their diversity of valence states [32–38]. The generated Fe4+ in Fe3+ doped TiO2 and the generated V4+ in V5+ doped Ta2O5 have strong oxidation power and strong reduction power, respectively. In this way, Fe4+ and V4+ easily undergo rapid redox reaction in controlled recombination center, which can be constructed by Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+. Because of the existence of composite redox cycle system (Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2), the photogenerated electrons (e−) on the conduction band (CB) of Ta2O5 can recombine with holes (h+) on the valence band (VB) of TiO2, so that the holes (h+) on the valence band (VB) of TiO2 and electrons (e−) on the conduction band (CB) of Ta2O5 are completely separated, obviously improving the photocatalytic activity. However, as wide band-gap semiconductors, TiO2 (Ebg = 3.2 eV) and Ta2O5 (Ebg = 3.9 eV) can be excited only under appropriate wavelength of ultraviolet-light irradiation (λ ≤ 387 nm and λ ≤ 342 nm, respectively) and that the ultraviolet-light only accounts for a small portion of solar light, which limits the application of TiO2 and Ta2O5 [39–42]. In order to enhance the utilization ratio of solar light, some researchers have made tremendous efforts to expand the light responding region and obtained remarkable achievements. For example, the use of up-conversion of luminescent agents such as Er3+:Y3Al5O12, Y2SiO5:Pr3+, Li and Tm3+,Yb3+:NaYF4 have displayed the important role for expanding the light responding region because they can convert low energy photons to higher energy photons [43,44]. That is, these up-conversion of luminescent agents can transform the visible-light into ultraviolet-light [45–48]. Therefore, as an outstanding representative up-conversion luminescence agents, the Er3+:YAlO3 is used to combine with Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2 composite photocatalys to provide the rich ultraviolet-light for satisfying the genuine requirement [49,50]. To some extent, the problems on recombination of photo-generated electrons (e−) and holes (h+) and low utilization rate of solar light can be solved by using above mentioned methods. However, there is still a challenge that is to accelerate the electron transfer rate for high photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. The studies showed that the loading of some noble metals (Au, Pt and Ag) as co-catalyst could transfer the electrons on the conduction band (CB) of photocatalysts and then make them be captured by hydrogen ions (H+) forming hydrogen [51–53]. Therefore, in this work the Au nanoparticles as co-catalyst were deposited on the surface of TiO2 to enrich photo-generated electrons (e−), thus further increasing the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity [54–57]. Herein, a superior up-conversion luminescence agent, Er3+:YAlO3, was synthesized by sol-gel methods. And then, a novel visible-light driven nanocomposite photocatalyst, Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite, was successfully prepared via sol-gel-hydrothermal method. It was placed in methanol aqueous solution to carry out an efficiency test of the hydrogen production under visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic experiments showed that the present Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite possessed of excellent photocatalytic activity for producing hydrogen under visible-light irradiation, which was much higher than that of Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2. In addition, the reusability of the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au was evaluated for the long-term application. This photocatalyst is expected to be applied in photocatalytic hydrogen generation by utilizing solar energy. The possible mechanisms of up-conversion luminescence of Er3+:YAlO3 and the related excitation principle of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au photocatalyst were also discussed in detail."

3,Preparation of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au,"2.2 Preparation of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au 2.2.1 Er3+:YAlO3 The up-conversion luminescence agent, Er3+:YAlO3, was synthesized by sol-gel method [58–60]. At the beginning, Y(NO3)3 and Er(NO3)3 solutions were planted by dissolving 0.0464 g Y2O3 (1.0 mmol) and 2.7281 g Er2O3 (71 mmol) into 50 mL hot HNO3 (14.5 mol/L) solution (about 60 °C), respectively. The planted Y(NO3)3 and Er(NO3)3 solutions were put together with 12.6208 g (33.65 mmol) Al(NO3)3·9H2O while stirring magnetically, and the homogenous solution was acquired. Then, the solid citric acid was also put into the mentioned mixture solution (mol ratio of citric acid: metal ion is 3:1). The solution was continued to be stirred and heated at 50–60 °C until the transparent sol was successfully formed. And then, the sol was heated at 80 °C for 24 h and became the gel. After the gel cooled in the air, it was ground into good homogeneous powders. For the sake of removing residual organic components and nitrate ions the powders were heated at 1100 °C for 2.0 h in a muffle furnace. In the end, the sintered substance was removed and permitted to cool down to the room temperature in atmosphere. Consequently, the Er3+:YAlO3 particles were obtained. 2.2.2 Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+ At room temperature, Ta2O5 sol was prepared in accordance with the following step. Firstly, 4.7266 g (11.642 mmol) Ta(OEt)5 was dissolved in 40 mL ethanol solvent and stirred for 2.0 h to obtain a precursor solution. During this period, 0.0068 g (0.058 mmol) NH4VO3 was added into Ta2O5 precursor solution. In addition, the concentration of vanadium was maintained constant (0.5 atom %). Secondly, fully grind nano-sized Er3+:YAlO3 powders were also added into Ta2O5 sol precursor solution. Then, the precursor solution was continuously stirred until yellow transparent sols were achieved. The Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+ sol was aged for about 12 h then dried under 80 °C up until dry gel. In addition, Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+ gel was heat-treated at 750 °C for 2.0 h. And then, Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+ coated composite was obtained. 2.2.3 Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2/Au At room temperature, the TiO2 was prepared in accordance with the following step. Firstly, the 3.9601 g (11.647 mmol) Ti(OBu)4 was dissolved in 40 mL ethanol solvent and stirred for 2.0 h to obtain a precursor solution. During this period, 0.0944 g (0.234 mmol) Fe(NO3)3∙9H2O was added into TiO2 precursor solution. In addition, the concentration of iron was maintained constant (1.0 atom %). Secondly, fully grind 0.7039 g (2.127 mmol) nano-sized Er3+:YAlO3 powders were also added into TiO2 sol precursor solution. Then, the precursor solution was continuously stirred until yellow transparent sols were achieved. The Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2 sol was aged for about 12 h then dried under 80 °C up until dry gel. In addition, Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2 gel was heat-treated at 550 °C for 2 h. And then, Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2 coated composite was obtained. Finally, 5.0002 g Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2 powder was placed into 200 mL methanol aqueous solution (0.791 g/mL) to be mixed using ultrasonic wave (80 kHz frequency and 50 W output power) technology. Then, 7.8 mL HAuCl4·4H2O aqueous solution was added into the above mixture and then adequately dispersed for 30 min. The suspended liquid was heated to boiling point and kept constant temperature for 30 min. After filtration and lavation, the separated powder was put into a crucible and heated in a constant temperature oven and then the temperature was controlled at 180 °C for 120 min. Finally, after grinding the Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2/Au composite was obtained.(see Scheme 1 ) 2.2.4 Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au The Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au photocatalysts were prepared through ultrasonic dispersion and high-temperature calcination methods. 5.00 g (7.53 mmol) Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2/Au and 0.00 g (0.00 mmol), 1.55 g (1.88 mmol) and 3.10 g (3.77 mmol) Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+ powders were added into three 100 mL beakers filled with 20 mL absolute alcohol, respectively, and then adequately dispersed by ultrasound of 40 kHz frequency and 300 W output power for 30 min. Subsequently, the turbid liquid was heated to boil and kept at constant temperature for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 2.00 h until all solvents evaporated. The resulting solid mixture was thoroughly ground, followed by calcination at 550 °C for 2.00 h. At last, after cooling down to room temperature, the different molar proportions (1.00:0.00, 1.00:0.25 and 1.00:0.50 of TiO2 and Ta2O5) of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au particles were obtained."
4,Characterization of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au,"2.3 Characterization of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au The prepared samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D-8, Bruker-axs, Germany), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-5610LV, Hitachi Corporation, Japan), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM2100, Hitachi Corporation, Japan) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, JEOL JSM-5610LV, Hitachi Corporation, Japan)."
5,Photocatalytic reactions,"2.4 Photocatalytic reactions 300 W xenon lamp (LX-300, Deruifeng hardware electrical appliance businesses, China) was used as simulated visible-light irradiation source. The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were carried out in a 500 mL Pyrex reactor system at indoor temperature and atmospheric pressure. In a typical photocatalytic reaction for hydrogen generator, 0.1000 g Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites were placed on the photoreactor under constant stirring in methanol aqueous solution (0.791 g/mL). Before visible-light irradiation, the system was bubbled with argon for 30 min to remove the dissolved air inside in order to ensure the reaction system was under an anaerobic condition. Then the system was irradiated for 5.0 h with visible-light through a cut off filter from a 300 W Xe lamp, which surrounded on side of photoreactor. The evolution hydrogen was periodically analyzed with a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar Carrier, Shimadazu, Japan)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, FT-IR and PL of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite","3.1 XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, FT-IR and PL of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite The compositions and crystal structures of as-prepared samples were examined by XRD. From Fig. 1 (a) it can be seen that the XRD pattern of as-prepared Er3+:YAlO3 powder is similar to JCPDS card 38–0222 data of YAlO3 (Fig. 1(o)). It proved that the YAlO3 phase has formed in prepared Er3+:YAlO3 sample. And that, according to the preparation process it can be confirmed that the Er3+ ions have entered the crystal lattice of YAlO3 replacing the partial Y3+ ions, due to the similarity of Er3+ and Y3+ in ionic radius. The further proof can be obtained in the EDX analysis. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the given XRD pattern of prepared TiO2 powder is consistent with JCPDS card 21–1272 data of anatase TiO2, which proves the formation of anatase phase TiO2. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the given XRD pattern of prepared Ta2O5 powder is consistent with JCPDS card 25–0922 data of orthorhombic phase β-Ta2O5. It indicated that the orthorhombic phase β-Ta2O5 had been prepared. Fig. 1(d, e and f) shows the XRD patterns of the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au with different molar ratios of TiO2 and Ta2O5 (from 1.00:0.00 to 1.00:0.50). The characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.46° (101), 47.16° (200), 54.04° (211) and 55.18° (105) of the sample can be easily indexed to JCPD card 21–1272 data of anatase TiO2. Besides, there is also a handful diffraction peaks, which can be indexed to JCPD card 04–0551 data of rutile TiO2. It demonstrates that the Fe3+-TiO2 part in Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au exists mainly in anatase phase TiO2. For the XRD patterns of samples in Fig. 1(e) and (f), the characteristic diffraction peaks can be detected at 2θ = 22.9°, 28.3°, 36.7°, 46.5° and 55.3°, attributed to (001), (110), (111), (002) and (021) crystal planes, respectively, which are consistent with JCPDS card 25–0922 data of orthorhombic β-Ta2O5 phase. Besides, only a few diffraction peaks are identified as tetragonal α-Ta2O5 (JCPD card 21–1199 data), which proves that, in Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au, the Ta2O5 mainly exists in the orthorhombic phase β-Ta2O5 as active component. Moreover, the diffraction peak intensities of Ta2O5 gradually increase along with the increase of its content and that the diffraction peak intensities of the TiO2 gradually drop. In addition, the XRD patterns of Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+ also showed some slight changes compared with those of pure TiO2 and Ta2O5 due to adding Fe3+ and V5+. No obvious Au diffraction peaks for all as-prepared photocatalysts are observed in the XRD patterns, which may be because the content of Au is too little and the uniform distribution on the surface of Fe3+-TiO2 particles. Nevertheless, the presence of Au will be confirmed by using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The morphologies of Er3+:YAlO3 (a-1), Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2/Au (a-2) and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites (a-3) were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) as shown in Fig. 2 (a). It can be seen from Fig. 2(a-1) that the homogeneous sphere of particles with average size of 30 nm are Er3+:YAlO3. Fig. 2(a-2) demonstrates that the as-prepared Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2/Au have aggregated, forming irregular spherical nanoparticles with different sizes (50–70 nm). Generally speaking, Fe-doped TiO2 is easy to form the nanoparticles with sizes of 15–20 nm [61]. However, it can be seen from Fig. 2(a-2) that the particle sizes have increased, which is due to coating the Er3+:YAlO3 particles, whose shape is irregular ellipsoid. Fig. 2(a-3) shows the whole morphology of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite, revealing that the sample is composed of numerous nanospheres with different sizes. They gather together forming large agglomerates. It can be speculated from Fig. 2(a-3) that the up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3) particles have been coated in the internal of Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+, respectively, showing two different particle sizes. The size of spheres is approximately 100 nm, which can be confirmed as the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+ coated nanospheres [62]. Meanwhile, some smaller nanospheres can be considered to be Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2 coated nanospheres. It also should be noted that the Au nanoparticles were hardly observed owing to their low loading content and very small size. However, the existence and distribution of Au nanoparticles on the surface of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2 composite particles can be proved by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) can be used to observe the detailed structural morphology of samples. Fig. 2(b) shows the TEM image of the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite particles with different magnification ratios (unit lengths corresponding to 100 nm, 50 nm and 10 nm, respectively). In Fig. 2(b-1) it can be seen that the Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5 -V5+ both display the irregular sphere shape with the average diameter of 60 nm. Besides, the Er3+:YAlO3 can also be found in the TEM image. To rise into 50 nm scale, as seen in Fig. 2(b-2), the structure becomes much more distinct. It can be seen that the Er3+:YAlO3 particles have been coated with Ta2O5-V5+ and Fe3+-TiO2, respectively. In addition, Au nanoparticles as co-catalysts are randomly dispersed on the surface of Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2 coated composites. To further enlarge the scale of 10 nm, many clear lattice fringes can be found in Fig. 2(b-3). By calculating lattice fringe spacing and then comparing with the XRD data, the crystal faces of the prepared Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite particles can be determined. The lattice space of Er3+:YAlO3 can be identified as 0.202 nm, corresponding to the (104) plane spacing of Er3+:YAlO3. The measured lattice spaces of 0.230 nm, 0.169 nm and 0.184 nm match well with the (111) plane of Au, (240) plane of Fe3+-TiO2 and (142) plane of V5+-Ta2O5, respectively. The calculated lattice space of crystallite are very close to those in literature references [63,64]. The TEM results also indicate that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au composite has a coated (core-shell) structure. Besides, some small nanospheres with a diameter around 30 nm should be Er3+:YAlO3 particles. Particularly, the existence of Au nanoparticles on the surface of Fe3+-TiO2 part in Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au can also be clearly identified in Fig. 2(b-2 and b-3). As expected, the spherical Au nanoparticles are some tiny nanoparticles (5–10 nm). As co-catalysts, they are dispersed randomly on the surface of TiO2 particles. Fig. 3 shows the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of the synthesized Er3+:YAlO3 (a) and prepared Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2/Au (b) and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites (c). As shown in Fig. 3(a), the strong signal peaks of O, Al, Er and Y atoms can be found, which proves that these elements compose the up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3) without any impurity. And these elements also exist in other two samples (as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c)), which are close to the stoichiometric ratio of Er3+:YAlO3. The EDX data (in Fig. 3(b)) can confirm that the strong peaks of O atom should belong to Er3+:YAlO3 and TiO2. Moreover, the weak peaks of Fe and Au atoms can also be found, which preliminarily confirms that the Fe3+ has been doped into TiO2 and the Au has been loaded on the surface of Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2/Au, based on the sol-gel and chemical deposition methods. As demonstrated in Fig. 3(c), the as-prepared sample contains Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2, Er3+:YAlO3 and Au, the ratio of whole constituents in the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite is similar to the molar ratios of used reactants. These results are basically consistent with those of XRD patterns presented above. To provide chemical information about the bonding structure in the samples, the FT-IR spectra of prepared Fe3+-TiO2, Ta2O5-V5+ and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite with different molar ratios (1.0:0.00, 1.0:0.25 and 1.0:0.50 of TiO2 and Ta2O5) are shown in Fig. 4 (a). In Fig. 4(a), a broad absorption band can be found around 3436 cm−1, which should be confirmed to be corresponding to hydrogen bonded -OH stretching vibration. Meanwhile, the obvious absorption peak at 1635 cm−1 can be ascribed to deformation vibrations of the -OH groups of adsorbed water molecules. For Ta2O5, the Ta-O stretching and Ta-O-Ta angular vibrations are found to be centered at 896 cm−1 and 720 cm−1, respectively. For TiO2, the characteristic absorption peaks are appeared in the range of 500–1000 cm−1, indicating the Ti-O stretching mode in crystalline TiO2. Notably, an intensive absorption peak at 649 cm−1 is characteristic vibration of the rutile TiO2. After coupling Ta2O5 and TiO2, FT-IR spectra of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites exhibit the overlap spectra of Ta2O5 and TiO2. However, new chemical bonds or solvent residue characteristic peaks can not be detected, further indicating that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites are of well prepared, which is in agreement with the XRD results. It is noteworthy that some peaks of Ta2O5 and TiO2 at 720 cm−1 and 649 cm−1 slightly shift to the higher wavenumber. It may be caused by the presences of doped V5+ and Fe3+ ions. This result clearly illustrates that there might be some interfacial interactions between Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+. In addition, it can be clearly found that the peak intensities of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite gradually increase along with the increasing content of Ta2O5, which shows more and more obvious features of Ta2O5. Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum is a significant method to confirm the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs in semiconductor. Generally, lower intensity signal in PL spectrum indicates lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. Conversely, higher intensity signal shows higher recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. From Fig. 4(b) it can be clearly found that the PL intensity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au is the lowest one for all samples, which reveals that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au possess lowest recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. This phenomenon is speculated in three reasons: (1) Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+ form a Z-scheme photocatalytic system. The photogenerated electrons (e−) on the conduction band (CB) of Ta2O5 can recombine with the holes (h+) on the valence band (VB) of TiO2. (2) The formation of strong oxidant (Fe4+) and strong reductant (V4+) on both sides of interface between TiO2 and Ta2O5 is helpful to transfer electrons (e−) from conduction band (CB) of Ta2O5 to valence band (VB) of TiO2. (3) Because of the existence of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) served as co-catalyst, the electrons (e−) on the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 will transfer to the surface of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) more efficiently to reduce H+ ions forming hydrogen. Overall, it is indicated that the Au nanoparticles deposited on the surface of TiO2 can not only accept electrons acting as active sites, but also restrain the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. This is the reason that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au displays a high photocalytic activity. In addition, compared with pure TiO2 and Ta2O5 the Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+ also give slightly low intensity signals, which indicates that the presences of Fe3+ and V5+ can decrease the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs to some extent."
8,"UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of prepared TiO2, Ta2O5, Fe3+-TiO2, Ta2O5-V5+ and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites","3.2 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of prepared TiO2, Ta2O5, Fe3+-TiO2, Ta2O5-V5+ and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites The optical diffuse absorption spectra of prepared TiO2 (a-1), Ta2O5 (a-2), Fe3+-TiO2 (b-1), Ta2O5-V5+ (b-2) and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites with different molar ratios (1.0:0.00 (c-3), 1.0:0.25 (c-4) and 1.0:0.50 (c-5) of TiO2 and Ta2O5) were measured at ambient temperature in the range of wavelength from 200 to 800 nm. As shown in Fig. 5 (a-1), it can be seen that a strong absorption band of TiO2 appears in the wavelength range below 380 nm. Fig. 5(a-2) shows that Ta2O5 has absorption in ultraviolet region. The absorption edge of Ta2O5 appears at 306 nm. From Fig. 5(b-1), it can be seen that, for Fe3+-TiO2, a strong absorption band appears in the wavelength range below 397 nm due to the charge transfer from O(2p) (VB) to Ti(3d) (CB) [65]. Fig. 5(b-2) shows that the Ta2O5-V5+ has also an intense absorption band below 322 nm, which is assigned to the charge transfer from O(2p) (VB) to Ta(5d) (CB). In comparison, the absorption edges of Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+ both shift slightly towards the longer wavelength due to the doping of Fe3+ and V5+. However, both Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+ are still wide band-gap conductor photocatalysts [66]. In addition, due to the presence of Au and Er3+:YAlO3, some visible-light absorption peaks can also be seen in the visible-light range of 500–600 nm, which demonstrates that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au as photocatalyst can also be responsive to visible-lights. In Fig. 5(c-3) it can be seen that the peak in 200–300 nm range seems more flat due to the absence of Ta2O5. In Fig. 5(c-4 and c-5), it can be found that, along with the increase of wide band-gap Ta2O5 content, the peaks between 200 nm and 300 nm are gradually enhanced. Based on the optical diffuse absorption spectra of prepared TiO2, Ta2O5, Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+, the corresponding band-gaps can be calculated as the following equation (1) [67]: (1) αhν = A(hν - Ebg)1/2 where α, h, ν, Ebg and A represent absorption coefficient, plank constant, light frequency, band-gap and a constant, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5(a-1, a-2, b-1 and b-2), the calculated band-gaps (Ebg) of as-prepared TiO2, Ta2O5, Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+ are 3.26 eV, 4.05 eV, 3.12 eV and 3.85 eV, respectively. Compared with the band-gaps of pure TiO2 and Ta2O5, due to the presence of heteroatoms (Fe3+ and V5+) the calculated band-gaps become slightly small [68,69], which is conducive to broaden the light response range. Moreover, the visible-ultraviolet up-conversion emission of Er3+:YAlO3 effectively activates the Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2 composites, which markedly enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency."
9,"Influence of molar ratio, initial solution pH and used times on visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite","3.3 Influence of molar ratio, initial solution pH and used times on visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite Fig. 6 (a) shows the relationship between the amount of photocatalytic hydrogen production of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite and molar ratio of TiO2 and Ta2O5 under visible-light irradiation. At first, it can be found that, for three courses, the amounts of photocatalytic hydrogen production all increase along with the increase of visible-light irradiation time. Within 5.0 h, for 3 M ratios of TiO2 and Ta2O5 (1.00:0.00, 1.00:0.25 and 1.00:0.50) the amounts of photocatalytic hydrogen production of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites could achieve 82 μmol g−1, 125 μmol g−1 and 159 μmol g−1, respectively. Apparently, the adding of Ta2O5-V5+ can enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production quantity of Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2/Au. It may be due to the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system, which effectively inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electrons (e−) and holes (h+) and enhances the photocatalytic activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Fe3+-TiO2/Au. And that the amount of photocatalytic hydrogen production is still on the increase along with increasing Ta2O5 content (from 1.00:0.00 M ratio to 1.00:0.50 M ratio of TiO2 and Ta2O5). The sequence of their photocatalytic activities based on the amounts of photocatalytic hydrogen production should be 1.00:0.50 > 1.00:0.25 > 1.00:0.00 at any visible-light irradiation time. However, it can be found that the increasing extent of photocatalytic hydrogen production from 1.00:0.25 M ratio to 1.00:0.50 M ratio of TiO2 and Ta2O5 has already begun to reduce compared with that from 1.00:0.00 M ratio to 1.00:0.25 M ratio. It indicates that the TiO2 and Ta2O5 molar ratio has an obvious effect on the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite as a Z-scheme photocatalyst. Because of various differences between TiO2 and Ta2O5, a suitable molar ratio of two semiconductor photocatalysts is necessary to construct an ideal Z-scheme photocatalytic system. For Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite as a Z-scheme photocatalyst, an ideal matching molar ratio of TiO2 and Ta2O5 should be close to 1.00:0.50. The influence of initial pH value on photocatalytic hydrogen production caused by Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite from methanol aqueous solution was investigated in the range of pH = 4.50–9.50 under visible-light irradiation. Obviously, from Fig. 6(b), it can be seen that the pH values closely influence the hydrogen production efficiency. When the pH value of the methanol aqueous solution increases from pH = 4.50 to pH = 6.50, the amount of hydrogen production goes up and the maximum amount of hydrogen production (160 μmol g−1) is achieved at pH = 6.50. And then, it begins to decrease along with further increasing pH values. It can draw a conclusion that weak acidic or neutral conditions are more suitable for photocatalytic hydrogen production when the methanol is used as electron donor, whereas strong acidic or alkaline conditions are both unfavorable. Of course, the influence of pH value on photocatalytic hydrogen production is very complicated. At least, in strong acidic solution (pH < pI (isoionic point)) the hydrogen ions (H+) can not get close to the positively charged surface of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite and are difficult to be reduced for generating H2. Conversely, in strong alkaline solution the insufficient hydrogen ions (H+) inhibit the photocatalytic hydrogen production. It is worth pointing out that the reusability of any photocatalyst is a crucial factor for its practical applications. To confirm the reusability of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite, additional three circulating run experiments were carried out in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation. In Fig. 6(c), it can be seen that there is no obvious decrease about the amount of hydrogen production within three cycles. That is, the photocatalytic activity does not display obvious decay after each use. It indicates that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites can be effectively recycled."
10,Possible up-conversion luminescence process and visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production mechanism of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite,"3.4 Possible up-conversion luminescence process and visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production mechanism of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite Recently, the luminescent characteristic of visible-ultraviolet up-conversion in Er3+:YAlO3 crystal has been reported by some research groups and the corresponding up-conversion mechanism has also been discussed in detail. On the basis of energy level data of Er3+ in Er3+:YAlO3, the up-conversion process can be accomplished through the chains of ground state absorption (GSA) and excited state absorption (ESA) [56,58]. When the Er3+:YAlO3 is pumped by 486 nm and 542 nm (or 548 nm) in visible-light, the up-conversion signals at 318 nm and 320 nm can be observed [59]. Moreover, the up-conversion signals at 326–342 nm and 354–359 nm are also found by 652.2 nm (or 657.8 nm) laser excitation [60]. Obviously, by absorbing two or more low-energy photons, the Er3+:YAlO3 could generate one high-energy photon. Solar light contains continuous pump wavelengths, which can be used as an excitation source. Thus, the up-conversion luminescence process may easily take place in Er3+:YAlO3 crystals. Based on the up-conversion luminescence feature of Er3+:YAlO3, the possible visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production mechanism of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composites were presented in Fig. 7 . The calculated band-gaps (Ebg) of the as-prepared Fe3+-TiO2 was 3.12 eV. Compared with the band-gap (3.20 eV) of pure TiO2, due to the presence of doped heteroatoms (Fe3+) its calculated band-gap had been slightly reduced, which was conducive to broaden the light response range. And that, for Ta2O5-V5+ the calculated band-gaps (Ebg) was 3.85 eV, which was also slightly smaller than that (3.90 eV) of pure Ta2O5. Even if the Fe3+ and V5+ ions had been doped into TiO2 and Ta2O5, respectively, the Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+ were still both wide band-gap semiconductors. The electrons (e−) on the valence band (VB) of Fe3+-TiO2 (Ebg = 3.12 eV) are excited to transit to the conduction band (CB), simultaneously creating photo-generated electrons (e−) and holes (h+) on the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), respectively. As up-conversion luminescence agent, the Er3+:YAlO3 can absorb visible-lights and then emits ultraviolet-lights, which can effectively activate the Ta2O5-V5+. Similarly, the photo-generated electrons from valence band (VB) of Ta2O5-V5+ transit to the conduction band (CB), creating photo-generated holes on the valence band (VB) at the same time. In addition, there is also a big problem to go against photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, that is, the recombination of electrons and holes would reduce the photocatalytic activity. In order to thoroughly separate photo-generated electrons (e−) and holes (h+), a novel Z-scheme photocatalyst was designed by employing a composite redox cycle system (Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2) in the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite. First, the combination of Ta2O5-V5+ and Fe3+-TiO2 brings more negative conduction band (CB) (−0.50 eV) than the water reduction potential (0.00 eV) and more positive valence band (VB) (+3.60 eV) than the water oxidation potential (+1.23 eV). Then, the electrode potentials of Fe4+/Fe3+ (+2.10 eV) and V5+/V4+ (+1.00 eV) are close to the valence band (VB) (+2.70 eV) of TiO2 and conduction band (CB) (−0.30 eV) of Ta2O5, respectively, which provide enough reaction conditions for Fe3+ and V5+ forming Fe4+ and V4+, respectively [61,70]. In the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction, the V5+ is reduced by electrons (e−) on conduction band (CB) of Ta2O5 and the Fe3+ is oxidized by holes (h+) on valence band (VB) of TiO2, simultaneously, generating V4+ with strong reduction power and Fe4+ with strong oxidation power. In fact, Fe4+ enough oxidizes V4+ on the interface of Ta2O5-V5+ and Fe3+-TiO2, which can be called as the artificial controllable recombination center, and then generating Fe3+ and V5+ again to return the original state. In the whole reaction of photocatalytic hydrogen production the infinite loop redox of Fe3+ and V5+ causes the electrons (e−) on conduction band (CB) of Ta2O5 and holes (h+) on valence band (VB) of TiO2 to be continuously consumed in the controlled recombination center. It results in the complete separation of the electrons (e−) on conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and the holes (h+) on valence band (VB) of Ta2O5 to perform highly effective visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production. It is noteworthy that the electrons (e−) are completely separated out from photo-generated electron-holes pairs and quickly transfer from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to the surface of co-catalyst Au [57]. Due to the high reducibility, the electrons (e−) can reduce the H+ in the water to produce H2. At the same time, the holes (h+) on the valence band (VB) of Ta2O5 can oxidize the methanol to methanal or methane acid. Therefore, the structure and composition of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite can completely restrain such recombination between electrons on conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and holes on valence band (VB) of Ta2O5. Overall, according to the transfer process of electrons and holes in the novel Z-scheme, the reduction and oxidation capacities of electrons and holes could be strengthened, respectively, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Detailed hydrogen generation processes are as shown in (2)–(11): (2) hν (visible-light) + [Er3+:YAlO3] → [Er3+:YAlO3]* (3) [Er3+:YAlO3]* → [Er3+:YAlO3] + hν (ultravoilet-light) (4) Fe3+-TiO2 + hν (ultravoilet-light) → e− CB(Fe3+-TiO2) + h+ VB(Fe3+-TiO2) (5) Ta2O5-V5+ + hν (ultravoilet-light) → e− CB(Ta2O5-V5+) + h+ VB(Ta2O5-V5+) (6) h+ + Fe3+-TiO2 → Fe4+-TiO2 (7) e− + Ta2O5-V5+ → Ta2O5-V4+ (8) Fe4+-TiO2 + Ta2O5-V4+ → Fe3+-TiO2 + Ta2O5-V5+ (On interface between TiO2 and Ta2O5) (9) e− CB(TiO2) + Au → e− (Au) (10) 2H+ + 2e− (Au) → H2 (11) h+ VB(Ta2O5) + CH3OH → HCHO → HCOOH → CO2 + H2O Based on the above analyses, it was believed that the presence of up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3) and co-catalytic (Au) can drastically enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalyst."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a novel Z-scheme Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite was prepared for the first time via a sol-gel-hydrothermal synthesis. The prepared Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au coated composite showed an especially high visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, due to the formation of Fe3+-TiO2 and Ta2O5-V5+ composite redox cycle system, which is conducive to electron transfer and charge separation. In addition, the presence of Au nanoparticles as co-catalyst forms more active sites and the use of Er3+:YAlO3 powder as up-conversion luminescence agent offers sufficient high-energy ultraviolet-light, which makes Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5-V5+||Fe3+-TiO2/Au perform effective visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.
