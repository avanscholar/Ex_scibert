0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean energy since combustion of H2 produces only water without greenhouse gases. Recent advances of hydrogen fuel cell technology also brighten the potential of using H2 energy [1,2]. As a consequence, hydrogen is considered a promising alternative energy carrier of the future [3]. To this end, developing hydrogen production technology leading to a sufficient and sustainable H2 supply is in high demand. Biohydrogen production via dark and photo fermentative processes using waste organic substrates has attracted much attention since the approach allows waste reduction with simultaneous hydrogen production [4,5]. However, to enhance the commercial viability of bioH2, a low-cost and high-conversion feedstock should be used. Among the possible candidates, starch is a suitable and cost-effective substrate for commercial biohydrogen production. Zhang et al. [6] demonstrated that biohydrogen production from starch wastewater could achieve a maximum yield of 92ml H2/g starch added in batch tests under thermophilic conditions (55°C and pH 6.0). However, the rate-limiting step for bioconversion of starch is usually the hydrolysis steps [7]. In particular, some efficient bacterial H2 producers (such as Clostridium pasteurianum) may lack the starch hydrolytic ability, thereby being unable to assimilate starch directly [8]. Therefore, a physicochemical or enzymatic pretreatment may be required to facilitate the H2 production efficiency from starch. Enzymatic hydrolysis is considered a preferable pretreatment method because it is efficient and environmentally friendly [9,10]. After starch hydrolysis, dark fermentation could convert the resulting reducing sugar more effectively to produce H2. As we have demonstrated in our recent work, a two-stage process combining starch hydrolysis and dark fermentation for bioH2 production seemed feasible [8,11]. Although the H2 production rate was much improved with the two-stage approach, the H2 yield was still relatively low when only dark fermentation was employed [8]. Meanwhile, the soluble metabolites produced from dark fermentation contain a high COD content (mainly volatile fatty acids), which should be treated before discharge of the effluent. It has been known that photosynthetic bacteria (e.g., purple nonsulfur bacteria) could utilize the soluble products resulting from dark fermentation, converting them into H2 via photo fermentation with simultaneous COD reduction [12,13]. Therefore, it seems to be theoretically feasible and practically achievable to integrate dark and photo fermentation for further enhancement of the overall H2 yield and COD removal efficiency. However, due to a much slower cell growth and H2 production rate, the photo fermentation step would most likely be a rate-limiting step when dark and photo fermentation are combined to trigger high-yield H2 production [14]. This work was undertaken to demonstrate the concept of using combination of starch hydrolysis, dark fermentation and photo H2 fermentation to achieve better hydrogen production efficiency from the utilization of starch feedstock, as this three-stage bioH2 process has not yet been disclosed in the literature. In the hydrolysis stage, starch was hydrolyzed in a sequencing batch reactor using our recent isolate Caldimonas taiwanensis On1 which is able to produce extracellular amylase [15]. The resulting starch hydrolysates (rich in reducing sugar) were used as the substrate for continuous dark fermentation with Clostridium butyricum CGS2 [11,16,17]. Finally, the effluent from dark fermentation (rich in volatile fatty acids) was continuously introduced to photo fermentation culture inoculated by Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5 [14,18]. The knowledge obtained from this study could be used to assess the feasibility of utilizing the three-stage system in practical bioH2 production. In addition, this demonstration could also be applied in developing similar systems converting other commercially viable feedstock (such as cellulosic materials) into H2 energy."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strains and cultivation,"2.1 Strains and cultivation The strain used for bacterial starch hydrolysis was Ca. taiwanensis On1, which was isolated from a hot spring in Taiwan and shown to produce extracellular starch hydrolytic enzymes [15]. C. butyricum CGS2 was a H2-producing anaerobic bacterium isolated from municipal sewage sludge [19]. R. palustris WP3-5 isolated from a wastewater treatment plant located in central Taiwan [18] was used for phototrophic H2 production. The hydrolyzed starch obtained from enzymatic pretreatment was subsequently used as the substrate for dark fermentation with C. butyricum CGS2 to produce hydrogen gas [17,19]. Likewise, the dark fermentation effluent was used as the substrate for photo fermentation with R. palustris WP3-5 for hydrogen production [20,21]. The medium used to grow Ca. taiwanensis On1 was Medium A (in g/l) composed of soluble starch, 10–50; (NH4)2SO4, 2; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.01; K2HPO4, 0.7; KH2PO4, 0.3 [22,23]. The culture medium for Clostridium species (Medium B) consisted of (in g/l) hydrolyzed or raw starch, 25–26; NH4HCO3, 5.24; NaHCO3, 6.72; K2HPO4, 0.125; CuSO4·5H2O, 0.005; CoCl2·5H2O, 0.000125; MgCl2·6H2O, 0.1; MnSO4·6H2O, 0.015; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.025; Na2S·9H2O, 0.5; Resazurin-2127, 0.001 [24]. The R. palustris WP3-5 strain was grown on Medium C (in g/l) composed of dark fermentation effluent, 4.0; K2HPO4, 0.5; KH2PO4, 0.5; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2; NaCl, 0.4; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.05; yeast extract, 0.2; 5ml/l of iron citrate solution (at 1.0g/l); 1ml of trace element solution [15,20]. The trace element solution (in mg/l) contained ZnCl2, 70; MnCl2·4H2O, 100; H3BO3, 60; CoCl2·6H2O, 200; CuCl2·2H2O, 20; NiCl2·6H2O, 20; NaMoO4·2H2O, 40; 1ml/l of HCl (at 25%). The starch was thermally gelatinized at 100°C prior to enzymatic pretreatment to improve the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of starch [25]."
3,Operation of sequencing batch reactor for starch hydrolysis,"2.2 Operation of sequencing batch reactor for starch hydrolysis Starch hydrolysis was the first stage, in which Ca. taiwanensis On1 was used to hydrolyze starch substrate [8,11]. Ca. taiwanensis On1 strain was pre-cultured at 55°C, pH 7.0 and 150rpm agitation for 12h in a 150ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20ml of Medium A. A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operation was used for starch hydrolysis conducted in a 5-L laboratory scale fermentor (Marubishi Model MDL-6C, Tokyo, Japan). The operation conditions for starch hydrolysis were as follows: working volume 2L; temperature 55°C; pH 6.0, 7.0, 8.0; agitation rate 150rpm; aeration rate 1, 1.5, 2, 3L/min of air (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5vvm). As amylase is considered a growth-associated product, it is inevitable that starch hydrolysis and cell growth occurred simultaneously. That means Ca. taiwanensis On1 would consume reducing sugar in the hydrolysate during the bacterial hydrolysis operation. To avoid significant consumption of reducing sugar due to cell growth, an appropriate control of cell growth against starch hydrolysis should be done. Since Ca. taiwanensis On1 grows less efficiently when dissolved oxygen level is low, an intermittent aeration during SBR operation was employed to maintain a high efficiency of starch hydrolysis by retaining a sufficient amount of amylase in the culture, while limiting excessive cell growth of Ca. taiwanensis On1 via aeration control. Each cycle of SBR was composed of feeding (10min), aeration (5h), reaction (adjusted), and discharging (10min) phases. Note that there was no sedimentation step in the SBR due to poor sedimentation efficiency of the Ca. taiwanensis On1 strain. The reaction time was adjusted to achieve a complete hydrolysis of starch. The concentration of total and reducing sugars was monitored during the course of experiments. The profile of cumulative reducing sugar production was described by modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) [26–29] to obtain the kinetic parameters more accurately. (1) RS = RS max exp { − exp [ R rs , max × e RS max ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where RS (g/L) is the concentration of reducing sugar produced at incubation time t (h), RSmax (g/L) is the potential maximum reducing sugar production, R rs,max (g/L/h) is the maximum rate of reducing sugar production, and λ (h) is the lag time prior to exponential reducing sugar production. Accordingly, the rate and yield of reducing sugar production were determined to assess the efficiency of reducing sugar production from starch using the bacterial hydrolysis procedures."
4,Operation of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for dark fermentation,"2.3 Operation of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for dark fermentation Dark fermentation was the second stage following starch hydrolysis in the three-stage process. The starch hydrolysate was first introduced into a storage tank (10L working volume) for pH adjustment and nutrient supply. The treated hydrolysate was then fed into the CSTR reactor (working volume=0.2L) to conduct dark fermentation. Before conducting CSTR for continuous dark H2 fermentation, the effect of nutrition supplements (i.e., Endo medium and modified Endo (ME) medium) on the starch hydrolysate was examined in batch tests carried out in 100ml vials at 37°C and an initial pH of 7.5. The ME medium possessed similar composition to that of Endo medium (Medium B) except for a different concentration in three components (i.e., NH4Cl, 0.717g/L; NaHCO3, 15g/L; and K2HPO4, 0.125g/L). In addition, both the autoclaved and nonsterile starch hydrolysates were used to examine if sterilization would be required for stable dark fermentation. The medium used for batch and continuous H2 production was prepared by purging argon into the hydrolysate-containing supernatant for 4min and then amending sufficient nutrients as indicated in Medium B. Batch hydrogen production was conducted by inoculating 3ml of C. butyricum CGS2 into 200ml flasks containing 150ml of Medium B, which was incubated at 37°C. The H2 content in the biogas and the concentration of total and reducing sugars in the liquid phase were measured at designated time intervals during cultivation. The profile of cumulative hydrogen production was described by the modified Gompertz equation shown as Eq. (2) [26–29]. (2) H = H max exp { − exp [ R max × e H max ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H (ml) is hydrogen produced at incubation time t (h), H max (ml) is the potential maximum hydrogen production, R max (ml/h) is the maximum rate of hydrogen production, and λ (h) is the lag time prior to exponential hydrogen production. Accordingly, the rate and yield of hydrogen production were determined to assess the hydrogen production efficiency using the hydrolyzed starch as carbon substrate. Continuous H2 production from hydrolyzed starch was also carried out using C. butyricum CGS2 as the H2 producer. The continuous culture was operated at 37°C and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12h using the hydrolyzed starch medium (Medium B) as the feed."
5,Operation of photobioreactor for phototrophic H2 production,"2.4 Operation of photobioreactor for phototrophic H2 production Photo fermentation was the final stage following dark fermentation in the three-stage process. A 10-L storage tank was also setup between dark fermentation and photo fermentation for pH adjustment and nutrient addition. Before conducting the continuous photobioreactor (PBR), batch photo fermentation with R. palustris WP3-5 was performed in a 250ml flask at 32°C, pH 7.1 and agitation rate of 100rpm using different medium prepared from dark fermentation effluents with the addition of nutrients according to Endo and ME medium. Moreover, autoclave and centrifugation pretreatment were also employed for dark fermentation effluent amended with Endo medium nutrients to examine the effect of bacterial contamination on photo H2 fermentation. The PBR was a glass-made vessel (1L working volume) equipped with external light sources (halogen lamps) adjusted to a light intensity of ca. 95W/m2. R. palustris WP3-5 was inoculated into the reactor to reach an initial cell concentration of 0.875g/L. The medium used for photo fermentation was Medium C. The reactor was controlled at 32°C and pH 7.1 with an agitation rate of 100rpm. A gas collecting device was connected to the gas exit to monitor gas production. The gas volume was calibrated to 25°C and 760mmHg. The composition of gas products was also measured with respect to time using gas chromatography. The liquid culture samples were collected from the sealed glass vessel at designated time intervals to determine cell concentration, pH and residual acetate and butyrate concentration. Cumulative evolution of H2 was simulated by modified Gompertz equation shown in Eq. (2)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) were analyzed by gas chromatography (Model 9800, China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) using a thermal conductivity detector. The carrier gas was argon. The column (inner diameter=2.159mm; height=4m) was packed with Porapak Q (China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan). The volatile fatty acids and ethanol were also detected by GC (GC-14B, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) using a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 15-m long capillary column (Type no. 11052, Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The detailed procedures for GC analyses were described in our recent work [30,31]. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a refraction index detection (RID-10A, Shimadzu, Japan) was also used to detect lactic acid in the filtered (0.2mm) supernatant of culture broth during bioH2 production. The column used in HPLC analysis was ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 column (Transgenomic, USA). The mobile phase was 0.008N H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.4ml/min. The injection sample volume was 20μl and the column temperature was controlled at 55°C. Cell concentration in the culture was determined by optical density measurement at a wavelength of 660nm (OD660) using a spectrophotometer (model U-2001, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The OD660 values were converted to dry cell weight concentration via proper calibration."
7,Results and discussion,
8,SBR operation for starch hydrolysis,"3.1 SBR operation for starch hydrolysis A starch-hydrolyzing bacterium, Ca. taiwanensis On1, produces amylase during cell growth to hydrolyze starch into reducing sugar, which is simultaneously utilized by the bacterial cells for biosynthesis and cellular maintenance. To minimize the consumption of reducing sugar by Ca. taiwanensis On1 cells, aeration condition was used as a control factor to avoid excessive cell growth, since growth of Ca. taiwanensis was dependent on the oxygen supply. Moreover, preliminary experiments showed severe pH drop during cell growth and starch hydrolysis process and the starch hydrolysis was restricted when pH was lower than 5.5 (Fig. 1 ). Therefore, in addition to aeration control, pH is also an important operation parameter for the bacterial starch hydrolysis. In the investigation of the effect of aeration condition on reducing sugar production, the culture was aerated only for the first 5h of each SBR cycle at a constant aeration rate of 0.5–1.5vvm. The aeration time of 5h was used because our preliminary tests showed that the growth of Ca. taiwanensis On1 in SBR culture reached stationary phase within 5h when oxygen supply was sufficient (data not shown). Hence a 5-h aeration time seems to be suitable to allow satisfactory cell growth and amylase production but avoids substantial reducing sugar consumption due to excessive cell growth. As depicted in Fig. 1 and Table 1 , a highest reducing sugar production rate (R max) of 1.06g R.S./h/L (R.S.: reducing sugar) occurred when the aeration rate was 1.0vvm, which also led to a maximum reducing sugar concentration and production yield of 13.15g R.S./L and 0.41g R.S./g starch, respectively. Table 1 shows that using an aeration rate of 0.5vvm gave a higher starch conversion (98.6%) than that obtained at 1.0vvm aeration rate (80%). However, the reaction time required to achieve the highest conversion for 0.5vvm aeration was double when compared to 1.0vvm aeration, indicating a slower reducing sugar production rate for 0.5vvm. As for the reason for why a higher conversion was achieved while operating at 0.5vvm aeration, it was found that the key issue was the variation of pH during starch hydrolysis reaction. For the culture aerated at 0.75–1.5vvm, the culture pH dropped sharply to pH 5.0 within 25h and the starch hydrolysis was terminated due to the low pH (Fig. 1). This finding is consistent with our recent results showing that the activity of amylase originating from Ca. taiwanensis On1 was essentially inhibited when pH was greater than 8.0 or lower than 5.0 [11]. In contrast, for operation with 0.5vvm aeration, the pH decreased only slightly to 7.2 after operation for nearly 50h and starch hydrolysis continued to proceed until reaching a nearly complete conversion (Fig. 1). Apparently, the control of pH at an appropriate level is extremely critical to the performance of starch hydrolysis. The effect of pH control on starch hydrolysis efficiency under an aeration rate of 1.0vvm and an aeration time of 5h is indicated in Fig. 2 and Table 2 . Starch hydrolysis could reach 100% conversion when pH was controlled at 6.0 and 7.0, while the culture without pH control or with an uncontrolled pH of 8.0 displayed a lower starch conversion (80 and 61%, respectively). With pH controlled at 7.0, the culture gave the highest reducing sugar production rate (R max) of 1.12g R.S./h/L. The cultures with a pH control at 6.0 and 7.0 exhibited better maximum reducing sugar concentration (16.62–16.79g R.S./L) and production yield (0.54–0.57g R.S./g starch) when compared to the uncontrolled and pH 8-controlled cultures (Table 2). Based on the foregoing data, the preferable pH control for starch hydrolysis with Ca. taiwanensis On1 was pH 7.0, which is in accord with our recent finding [15]. The optimal conditions of pH 7.0 and 1.0vvm aeration rate (with 5-h aeration) were applied to starch hydrolysis operation using SBR. The results of starch hydrolysis and reducing sugar production are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3 . The Ca. taiwanensis On1 strain was inoculated at the first cycle. After the starch hydrolysis was complete, 75% of working volume was replaced by fresh starch medium (Medium A). The SBR process was operated for five cycles, achieving a reducing sugar production rate of 0.75–1.02g R.S./h/L and a high starch hydrolysis rate of 2.30g starch/h/L. Furthermore, the total sugar decreased significantly (about 10–20g/L) once the aeration was employed in the early stage of each cycle. This indicates that Ca. taiwanensis On1 consumed a considerable portion of reducing sugar for growth under aerobic conditions. However, the SBR reactor could be repeatedly operated for starch hydrolysis and allowed a shorter reaction time when compared to the batch culture."
9,Continuous dark H2 fermentation using starch hydrolysis effluent as the substrate,"3.2 Continuous dark H2 fermentation using starch hydrolysis effluent as the substrate The starch hydrolysate from the effluent of starch hydrolysis reactor was collected in a storage tank, where the hydrolysate was fed into dark fermentation reactor continuously at a HRT of 12h. Prior to actually running the continuous culture, preparative experiments were conducted to evaluate whether pretreatment or nutrient addition on the hydrolysate would be necessary. The preliminary tests showed that it is necessary to supply nutrients to the starch hydrolysate in order to achieve a satisfactory performance of dark H2 fermentation. Endo medium (Medium B) was very suitable for C. butyricum CGS2 in fermentative H2 production [16] and was thus used as nutrient supplements for dark fermentation. A modified version of Endo medium (ME medium) with low ammonia content was also used as the nutrient additives. Moreover, to examine the effect of coexistence of Ca. taiwanensis On1 and C. butyricum CGS2 cells on H2 production performance, the autoclaved and nonautoclaved starch hydrolysates were used as the substrate for dark fermentation. The H2 production results coming from different combinations of nutrient addition and pretreatment method are compared in Fig. 4 and Table 4 , showing that the H2 production performance with Endo medium was better than that with the ME medium. Meanwhile, hydrogen production from starch hydrolysate without autoclave treatment was better than that with autoclave treatment (Fig. 4 and Table 4). In the nonautoclaved hydrolysate, the residual amylase in the medium would continue to hydrolyze starch into reducing sugar while feeding into dark fermentation tank. In contrast, the autoclave treatment would cause the denaturation of the remaining amylase, thereby no extra hydrolysis was observed during the feeding process [11]. This is supported by the higher concentration of reducing sugar in the nonautoclaved starch hydrolysate than in the autoclaved hydrolysate. As a result, C. butyricum CGS2 produced more H2 with a higher production rate when the hydrolysate did not undergo autoclave treatment. It is also noted that the presence of Ca. taiwanensis On1 in dark fermentation culture did not slow down H2 production with C. butyricum CGS2 cells, making the integration of the starch hydrolysis and dark fermentation processes easier. From the foregoing results, the best pretreatment of starch hydrolysate used for dark fermentation was the combination of Endo medium addition and without autoclave treatment. This optimal starch hydrolysate was fed into the continuous dark fermentation process. In the early stage (stage A), the initial pH of influent starch hydrolysate was adjusted to pH 7.5 [16] with the addition of Endo medium nutrients as well as 0.5g/L of Na2S to decrease the dissolved oxygen content in the medium [16]. However, in stage A, the hydrogen production rate was poor (below 0.2L H2/h/L) at HRT=12h (Fig. 5 ). The major by-product of dark fermentation in stage A was lactic acid (ca. 12.3mg COD/L), with lesser amounts of acetic acid and butyric acid. The probable reason for the poor H2 production performance was that Ca. taiwanensis On1 grew abundantly in the starch hydrolysate storage tank, leading to a low reducing sugar concentration in the influent. This seemed to suggest that addition of the reducing agent (i.e. Na2S) was not enough to maintain the anaerobic condition in the starch hydrolysate medium so that Ca. taiwanensis On1 grew easily consuming most of the reducing sugar in the starch hydrolysate. Therefore, in the stage B, an additional argon gas sparging was employed in the influent to ensure an anaerobic condition. The results show that the hydrogen production rate was still not improved (Fig. 5). The major liquid metabolic product in stage B was also lactic acid (ca. 12.8g COD/L), with lesser amounts of acetic acid and butyric acid. The operation strategy was modified in stage C, in which pH control was employed in the dark fermentation reactor, while the initial pH in the starch hydrolysate was not adjusted and Na2S was not added. The addition of Endo medium nutrients and argon gas purging were still employed in the influent. The initial pH in the starch hydrolysate storage tank became nearly 9.0 so that no cell growth was observed in the medium tank. The results for stage C turned out to be much better as the hydrogen production rate maintained at the level of 0.22LH2/h/L while feeding at 12h HRT. The major by-products in stage C were acetic and butyric acids (ca. 12.0g COD/L), with lesser amounts of lactic acid, propionic acid and ethanol. This H2 production rate is only nearly 50% of that obtained from our recent work using well-controlled hydrolyzed starch as substrate [8], as the starch hydrolysate was prepared by several pretreatments, such as centrifuging at 12,000rpm (11,100g) for 20min, purging argon into the hydrolysate-containing supernatant for 4min and supplementing sufficient nutrients [8]. Since those pretreatments were not practical in the proposed integrated process, the H2 production rate obtained here is lower than that of our recent work. Nevertheless, this work demonstrated that dark fermentative hydrogen production directly from effluent of starch hydrolysis process seems feasible."
10,Continuous photo H2 fermentation using dark fermentation effluent as the substrate,"3.3 Continuous photo H2 fermentation using dark fermentation effluent as the substrate Batch tests were conducted to examine the photo fermentation performance of using effluents from dark fermentation fed with starch hydrolysate amended with Endo medium and ME medium. Moreover, autoclave and centrifugation (6,000rpm, 10min) pretreatment were also employed to investigate the effect of coexistence of C. butyricum CGS2 and R. palustris WP3-5 in photo fermentation culture. Fig. 6 shows that the performance of photo fermentative H2 production using ME medium-supplemented dark fermentation effluent (bar A in Fig. 6) was slightly better than that of using Endo medium nutrients (bar B in Fig. 6). This result is most likely due to the lower residual ammonia concentration in the ME medium-supplemented dark fermentation effluent, as ME medium contained a much lower concentration of ammonia than that in Endo medium. However, the difference of using Endo and ME medium was only marginal in terms of phototrophic H2 production efficiency. Furthermore, the performance of photo fermentation with the autoclaved and centrifuged effluent from dark fermentation (bar B in Fig. 6) was significantly better than that without autoclave and centrifugation treatment (bar C in Fig. 6). The theoretical H2 yield for bars A, B and C is 587, 601 and 595ml H2, respectively. These results revealed that removal of C. butyricum CGS2 from the dark fermentation effluent appeared to enhance the efficiency of photo H2 fermentation. However, this additional pretreatment will increase the overall H2 production cost and also make the operation more difficult. From batch test results, type B strategy (Fig. 6) seemed to be a better choice and was thus applied for continuous photo fermentation. The HRT was 48h and the concentration of acetate and butyrate in the influent of photobioreactor was ca. 900 and 2900mg COD/L, respectively, resulting from three-fold dilution of dark fermentation effluent. The overall H2 production rate was within the range of 8.8–13.2ml/h/L. The pH maintained at 7.2 and the cell concentration maintained at ca. 6.6g/L. Feeding with the diluted dark fermentation effluent, the photo fermentation stage produced H2 successfully at a lower rate when compared with the optimal value of 24.9ml H2/h/L obtained from our recent study using synthetic medium with statistical experimental design [21]. However, the H2 production rate obtained in this work seems satisfactory since that optimal rate obtained in our recent study was achieved in batch tests under well-controlled conditions [21] that are not suitable for the operation in the present integrated dark–photo fermentation system."
11,Performance evaluation for the proposed three-stage process,"3.4 Performance evaluation for the proposed three-stage process Fig. 7 shows the calculated COD balance for the proposed three-stage process. In the starch hydrolysis stage, 35g/L of starch was hydrolyzed to 20g/L of reducing sugar by the SBR bacterial hydrolysis operation. The starch hydrolyzed rate and reducing sugar production rate were 2.30–2.98g starch/h/L and 0.78–1.02g reducing sugar/h/L, respectively. Although nearly 20% of total sugar was consumed by the growth of Ca. taiwanensis On1, the starch hydrolysis efficiency of SBR operation could be further improved by optimizing the replacement volume of each SBR cycle and the aeration time for bacterial growth control. For the dark fermentation stage, the reducing sugar (ca. 17g/L or 18.1g COD/L) in the influent was completely utilized by dark fermentation culture at a HRT of 12h, resulting in a H2 production yield of 5.40mmol H2/g COD (or 5.76mmol H2/g reducing sugar). In comparison, Zhang et al. produced hydrogen gas from starch directly in batch test under pH 6.0 and 55°C [6] and obtained a hydrogen yield of 92ml H2/g starch added, which can be converted to 2.88mmol H2/g COD by a conversion factor of 0.844g starch/g COD. This indicates the influence of the type of starch substrate on the efficiency of hydrogen production in dark fermentation. In addition, the starch hydrolysis step seems to be useful in promoting the conversion of starch to bioH2. The soluble microbial products (SMP) including total volatile fatty acids and ethanol were 15.5g COD/L. Therefore, the COD removal in dark fermentation process was about 14.3%. Finally, at a HRT of 48h and an influent organic loading of 3800mg COD/L, the photo fermentation stage displayed a 40% COD removal with a H2 yield of 10.72mmol H2/g COD, which is nearly double of the yield obtained from dark fermentation. Thus, combining dark and photo fermentation processes allowed a marked enhancement in overall H2 production yield (16.1mmol H2/g COD or 3.09mol H2/mol glucose) and also enabled a 54.3% COD removal. Although the overall yield is way lower than the theoretically maximum value of 12mol H2/mol glucose, this study is one of the early attempts demonstrating the feasibility of using a three-stage integration process that could convert starch into H2. Yet, the process optimization has not been established and will be the primary focus of our future work."
12,Conclusions,"This work successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a three-stage starch-to-H2 process combining enzymatic hydrolysis, dark fermentation and photo fermentation. The SBR process was operated repeatedly for five cycles, achieving a reducing sugar production rate of 0.75–1.02g reducing sugar/h/L and a high starch hydrolysis rate of 2.30g starch/h/L. Furthermore, the dark hydrogen production rate was kept at the level of 0.22L H2/h/L at HRT 12h with an influent reducing sugar concentration of 17g/L. Finally, the overall photo hydrogen production rate maintained within the range of 8.8–13.2ml/h/L when HRT was 48h and the influent concentration of acetate and butyrate was ca. 900 and 2900mg COD/L, respectively, giving a two-fold increase in H2 yield when compared with the yield from dark fermentation. The overall H2 yield and COD removal percentage of the three-stage process were 16.1mmol H2/g COD (3.09mol H2/mol glucose) and 54.3%, respectively. This feasibility study indicates the potential of utilizing this three-stage process for high-yield conversion of starch into bioH2."
