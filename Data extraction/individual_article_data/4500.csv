0,Introduction,"Sludge is a by-product of wastewater treatment plant with about 80% moisture content. It contains organic matter, inorganic particles, bacteria, heavy metals, etc [1]. Its disposal accounts for 45–65% of the total wastewater treatment plant operating expense and produces secondary pollution with conventional methods (e.g. landfills, composting and incineration) [2]. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is a green chemistry process that uses supercritical water (SCW, P c > 22.12 MPa, T c > 374.15 °C) as media to degrade organics in sludge into CO2, H2O, N2 and other small molecular matters. SCWO has been demonstrated as a promising and benign technology to treat municipal sewage sludge and organic wastewater with high degradation rate and no NOx generation [3]. SCWO of sludge has been previously studied [4]. SCWO rendered the total organic carbon (TOC) content of sludge with a moisture content of 96.5% to less than 20 mg L−1 [5]. Xu et al. [6] achieved chemical oxygen demand (COD), TOC and ammonia (NH3–N) removal ratios of 99.95%, 99.8% and 99.7% respectively, using reaction conditions of 540 °C and 25 MPa with a high water content sludge (99.2%). However, when 87% moisture content sludge was used as the feedstock, due to the high initial organic content, even at 550 °C and with an oxidation coefficient of 4.0, TOC and NH3–N contents in liquid products reached 1418 mg L−1 and 3542 mg L−1, respectively [7]. Qian et al. [7] attributed the high carbon and nitrogen contents to the formation of refractory intermediate products such as pyridine, phenol and NH3–N. Compared with sludge, alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol and isopropanol) were quite readily degradable. The disappearing rate expressions of methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH) and isopropanol (IPA), as well as pyridine (Py), phenol (PhOH) and NH3–N, were summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 also presents the disappearing rates calculated at 450–600 °C to show the activeness of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol and the recalcitrance of pyridine, phenol and NH3–N [8–21]. Co-oxidation is a phenomenon that the oxidation rate of recalcitrant species accelerates at the presence of reactive species [22,23], which was first observed by Hong et al. [24]. Zhang et al. [25] reported that it was HO2 and OH radicals produced by methanol that promoted the conversion rates of acetic acid and phenol by 60% and 36%, respectively. Ploeger et al. studied the co-oxidation effects between ethanol and NH3 [26], as well as ethanol and methylphosphonic acid [23]. 1 mmol ethanol improved the conversion rates of 1 mmol NH3 from 20% to 65% at 700 °C, 246 bar and 2.5 s. The conversion rate of methylphosphonic acid rose from 14% to 39% with an increase in the ethanol contents from 1.0 mmol·L-1 to 2.4 mmol L−1. Cabeza et al. [27] observed that isopropanol motivated the conversion of NH3 only when the mole fraction of isopropanol was less than 0.25. Like homogenous catalysts, alcohols might accelerate the conversion rates of refectory species or intermediate products of sludge, e.g., pyridine, phenol and NH3–N. However, superior to homogenous catalysts, adding alcohols can support energy for SCWO reaction and avoid salt deposition problems caused by alkali metal salt catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, no prior study has compared the co-oxidation effects between sludge and three typical reactive alcohols (methanol, ethanol and isopropanol) in supercritical water. The work herein first studied the effects of alcohol type and volume percent on the degradations of carbon and nitrogen in sludge. Furthermore, we sought to elucidate this co-oxidation effects through detailed chemical kinetics modeling and product characterization."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sludge with a moisture content of 84.7% was taken from the Beishiqiao wastewater treatment plant in Xi’an, Shaanxi, China. We adjusted its moisture to 87% to enhance the liquidity of sludge. Chemical characteristics of the 87% sludge are listed in Table 2 . 30% of H2O2 (analytical reagent) purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. was severed as oxidant for SCWO process. HPLC grade of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and dichloromethane were all obtained from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd."
3,Experimental setup and procedures,"2.2 Experimental setup and procedures Co-oxidation experiments were carried out in coiled tube reactors (length = 2.5 m, O.D. = 14 mm, I.D. = 8 mm, volume = 125 mL, 316 SS) and heated by a sand bath filled with Al2O3 as the medium. The process diagram of the experimental apparatus was illustrated in Fig. 1 . Ten identical reactors were fabricated to improve the experiment efficiency. A detailed description of the co-oxidation apparatus can be found in our previous work [28]. Each reactor was carefully loaded with certain amounts of sludge and alcohols using a syringe through one end of the reactor, and then H2O2 was loaded through another end of the reactor. Total loadings of sludge, alcohol and H2O2 were determined so as to reach the pressure of 25 MPa at a given temperature. The volume fraction of alcohols (the volume of alcohol divided by the sum of the volumes of alcohol and sludge) was set at 0–20% while the oxidation coefficient was kept at 1.5. After being loaded, the reactors were sealed and agitated by hands to ensure the full contact of sludge and oxidants and then immediately inserted into a pre-heated sand bath at a set-up temperature of 450–600 °C. After 20 min, the reactors were taken out from the sand bath and placed into cold water for 30 min to reach the equilibrium. Finally, nitrogen was used to blow the reactor to achieve a complete transfer of the liquid and solid products to a funnel for separation. The volume of the liquid products after SCWO was measured, and it accounted for more than 90% of the feedstock volume, indicating that no leaking happened during co-oxidation experiments."
4,Analysis methods,"2.3 Analysis methods 2.3.1 Liquid products TOC concentrations of liquid products were measured by a TOC analyzer (Model ET1020A). NH3–N concentrations were analyzed through an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Model 752) based on a linear calibration established by standard NH4Cl solution. The remaining liquid products were extracted by dichloromethane three times under neutral (pH = 6.7), acid (pH = 3 with H2SO4) and basic (pH = 12 with NaOH) conditions, respectively. The extractant was condensed to 1 mL for gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) and fourier transform infrared spectoscopy (FT–IR) analyses. Qualitative analyses of samples were performed on a Agilent GC–MS (Model 6890) equipped with a high polar capillary column (HP-INNOWax Polyethylene Glycol, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness) or a Shimadzu GC–MS (Model QP2010 Ultra) equipped with a low polar capillary column (Rxi-5Sil MS, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness) to identify the organic compounds in liquid products. The heating profile for Agilent GC–MS was elucidated as follows: 1) held at 50 °C for 2 min; 2) increased to 80 °C at a rate of 6 °C·min−1 and held for 2 min; 3) increase to 160 °C at a rate of 4.5 °C·min−1 and held for 3 min; 4) increase to 200 °C at a rate of 2 °C·min−1 and held for 3 min; 5) increase to 250 °C at a rate of 4.5 °C·min−1 and held for 3 min; 6) increase to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C·min−1 and held for 15 min. A NIST 11 library was applied for compound identification. A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectoscopy (Model Nicolet 5700) was used to characterize the functional groups in liquid products. One droplet of the extractant mixed with KBr was ground in an agate mortar and tableted for FT–IR analyses (range: 4500–400 cm−1; resolution: 0.4 cm−1; scan: 16). 2.3.2 Solid products Thermal gravity analysis (TGA, Model WCT-2C) was performed to determine the organic content of solid products at a heating rate of 20 °C·min−1 from 40 °C to 800 °C with air. Mass of samples was fixed at 10 ± 0.1 mg. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Model JSM–6390A) was used to roughly determine element compounds of solid products."
5,Calculation methods,"2.4 Calculation methods Researchers have reported that the SCWO of organic compounds occurred primarily through free radical pathways rather than ionic pathways because of the low dielectric constant of SCW [22,29–31]. To better understand the role of alchols, radical analyses were performed in a closed-0D reactor by detailed chemical kinetics models (DCKM) with the SENKIN code [32] in the Chemkin software. The original thermodynamic data coupled with Chemkin were revised in large specific heat regions [33] according to NIST data due to the high pressure environment in SCWO processes. Only water was considered in the calculation of experimental densities for the high moisture content of sludge and alcohol mixture. Pressure input into the software was manually increased to guarantee the identity of calculated and experimental densities because calculations in Chemkin were based on the ideal gas conception and concentration was used as criteria. Eq. (1) gives the expression of input pressure when calculating. For example, the input pressure was 36.37 MPa when the experimental pressure was 25 MPa at 450 °C. (1) P = ρ R T where P is the input pressure, ρ is the actual density, T is the temperature and R is the gas constant (8.314 J·(mol K)−1). For methanol, a model proposed by Ren et al. [33] was applied, which was based on Li’s model for gas phase combustion [34]. It included 23 species and 104 reactions. In Li’s model, the conversion rate of CO to CO2 and the induction time of methanol conversion were underestimated while the flame temperature was overestimated. However, by revising several pressure dependent reactions in Li’s model, Ren’s model was reliable for SCWO environment and verified by the experimental data proposed by Brock et al. [8] (see the supplementary data). For ethanol, a model established by Rice and Croiset [35] was used, which was based on Marinov’s model for gas phase combustion. It contained 65 species and 438 reactions. Compared with Marinov’s model, Rice and Croiset performed the following revisions: 1) revised the decomposition rate of H2O2; 2) added the reaction mechanisms of CH3O2; 3) included the reaction: CH3OH + H = CH3 + H2O; 4) added the reaction mechanisms of CH3CHO; 5) added the reaction mechanisms of HOCO; 6) added the reaction: CH2O + HO2 = HCO + H2O2. By further revising the thermodynamic data in large specific heat regions, the remaining ethanol ratio calculated by this model fitted well with Rice and Croiset’s experimental data. Experimental data obtained by Schanzenbacher et al. [12] also applied to demonstrate the reliability of this model. These two comparison figures are shown in the supplementary data. To the best of our knowledge, there were no prior models for the SCWO of isopropanol although mechanisms of gas-phase combustion of isopropanol were widely investigated. Johnson et al. [36] studied the ignition process of n-propanol and isopropanol in a shock tube and built a DCKM based on the unimolecular decomposition, hydrogen abstraction and radical decomposition processes. Frassoldati et al. [37] established a DCKM of n-propanol and isopropanol based on the reaction mechanisms of C16. Togbe et al. [38] added the reaction: IC3H7OH + OH = C3H7O + H2O to accelerate the decomposition rate of isopropanol. Based on Togbe et al.’s [38] model, we revised the thermodynamic properties of H2O in large specific heat regions. We also revised or added some reactions regarding the most reactive radicals (HO2· and OH·) in order to further improve the degradation rate of isopropanol in SCW. These modifications are shown in Table 3 . The revised kinetic data involve 236 species and 1419 reactions. Fig. 2 shows the conversion rate of isopropanol using our revised model and experimental data obtained by Hunter et al. [40]. The calculation data based on Togbe et al.’s model [38] was on the very right side of Hunter al.’s experimental data. After reactions in Table 3 were revised or added, isopropanol’s decomposition rates obviously improved, indicating the accuracy of our model."
6,Data interpretation,"2.5 Data interpretation TOC concentration after co-oxidation may be attributed to unreacted alcohols or sludge. The calculation TOC concentration is defined as Eq. (2): (2) TOC Cal = TOC Sludge × 1 - X TOC Sludge + TOC Alcohol × 1 - X TOC Alcohol where TOCCal is the calculated TOC concentration, TOCSludge is the TOC concentration of sludge in the feedstock, X TOC Sludge is the removal rate of TOC when the volume percent of sludge is 100%, TOCAlcohol is the TOC concentration of alcohols in the feedstock and X TOC Alcohol is the removal rate of alcohols when the volume percent of alcohols is 100%. X TOC Alcohol is measured and presented in the supplementary material. NH3–N concentrations after the reaction only originate from unreacted sludge since alcohols contain no nitrogen. The calculation NH3–N concentration is defined as Eq. (3): (3) NH 3 - N Cal = NH 3 - N Sludge × 1 - X NH 3 - N Sludge where NH3–NCal is the calculated NH3–N concentration, NH3–NSludge is the ammonia concentration of sludge in the feedstock, X NH 3 - N Sludge is the removal rate of ammonia when the volume percent of sludge is 100%. Initial TOCSludge, TOCAlcohol, NH3–N and O2 concentrations with different alcohol types and volume fractions are summarized in the supplementary materials. Oxidant coefficient (n) is defined in Eq. (4). (4) n = O 2 from the complete decomposition of H 2 O 2 theoretically required O 2 for the complete oxidation of COD The total average relative molecular weight (RMW) is defined as follows: (5) total average RMW = ∑ i = 1 m Relative proportion by area of the i compound × relative molecular mass of the i compound where m is the number of peaks on GC–MS total ion chromatogram whose relative proportions by area are higher than 1%."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of methanol,"3.1 Effect of methanol Fig. 3 shows the effects of 0–20% methanol on TOC and NH3–N contents of sludge at 450–600 °C, 20 min and n = 1.5. TOC contents decreased with an increase in temperature and the volume percent of methanol. Furthermore, TOCCal and NH3–NCal were always higher than experimental TOC (TOCExp) and NH3–N (NH3–NExp) contents, respectively, indicating the co-oxidation effects between methanol and sludge in the degradation of TOC and NH3–N. Although the NH3–N contents decreased with an increase in the methanol fraction, the NH3–N content was as high as 1394 mg L−1 at 550 °C and with 20% methanol, indicating that a reaction temperature of 600 °C was essential to reduce the NH3–N to lower than 1000 mg L−1. Apart from the improvement in the degradation of TOC and NH3–N in sludge by methanol observed in our study, researchers also found the similar promotion effects of methanol on other carbon-containing organics or NH3 when conducting SCWO experiments with deca-chlorobiphenyl [41], 2-chlorobiphenyl [42], 4-chlorobiphenyl [30], monochlorobiphenyl [43], 3,3′,4,4′-tetrachlorobiphenyl [44], methane [45], landfill leachate [46] and NH3–N [47,48]. Sludge contained a large amount of carboxylic acid acids and generated phenols as an important immediate product [7]. Zhang et al. [25] have verified the co-oxidation effects of methanol on acetic acid and phenol. For acetic acid, methanol not only shortened the induction time but also enhanced the reaction rate of oxidation. Methanol first provided HO2· and OH radicals (see Eq. (6) and Eq. (7)), and then oxidation reactions initiated with the decarboxylic reactions by consuming the OH radical or O2 (see Eq. (8) and Eq. (9)). For phenol, the reduction of induction time was more important. Reactions between phenol and O2 or between phenol and HO2 or OH radicals produced the C6H5O radical to stimulate further reactions (see Eq. (10)–(12)) [25]. The studies above all confirmed that it was HO2 and OH radicals initially produced by methanol that accelerated the removal of carbon-containing organics or NH3. (6) CH3OH+O2 = H2OH + HO2 (7) CH3OH + O = CH2OH + OH (8) CH3COOH + OH = CH3COO + H2O (9) CH3COOH + O2 = CH3COO + HO2 (10) C6H5OH + O2 = C6H5O + HO2 (11) C6H5OH + HO2 = C6H5O + H2O2 (12) C6H5OH + OH = C6H5O + H2O"
9,Effect of ethanol,"3.2 Effect of ethanol Fig. 4 shows the effects 0–20% ethanol on TOC and NH3–N contents of sludge at 450–600 °C, 20 min and n = 1.5. Similar to the co-oxidation effect between methanol and sludge, both increasing the reaction temperature and the volume percent of ethanol decreased TOC contents in the liquid products. Experimental TOC and NH3–N contents were lower than their calculated values, suggesting the co-oxidation effects between ethanol and sludge. The TOC content was 882 mg L−1 at 550 °C with 20% ethanol but decreased to 581 mg L-1 at 600 °C even without ethanol. At a temperature lower than 600 °C, NH3–N content in the liquid products was higher than its initial concentration, or to put it another way, X NH 3 - N was negative. A possible explanation might be that most nitrogen in sludge was organic nitrogen and organic nitrogen in sludge was converted to NH3–N with an increase in the temperature [49], but NH3–N could not be efficiently degraded at 450–550 °C. This phenomenon was also observed by Goto et al. [5] and Du et al. [50]. It was demonstrated that the temperature played a more important role in the degradation of TOC and NH3–N than adding ethanol. In addition to the co-oxidation effects between sludge and ethanol shown in Fig. 4(a), Ploger et al. [23] reported that although ethanol with low concentration (0.1 mmol L−1 and 0.3 mmol L−1) exerted little influence on the final TOC of methylphosphonic acid (MPA), conversion rates of MPA increased from 14% to 29% when the ethanol content equaled the MPA content (1 mmol L−1) at 473 °C and 2 s. It evinced that the co-oxidation effect only appeared when the ethanol content reached a certain amount. In our experiment, when the volume fraction of ethanol changed from 5% to 20%, its mole concentration was 0.29–0.67 mol L−1. Due to the high content of ethanol, obvious co-oxidation effect could be observed even with 5% ethanol. TOC content in the liquid products decreased from 5277 mg L−1 to 3506 mg L−1 with only 5% ethanol. Ploger et al. [22] pointed out that it was the HO2 radical rather than the OH radical produced by ethanol that promoted the conversion of MPA. In our experiment, sludge might capture the HO2 radical generated by ethanol and thus the destruction of TOC improved. In Fig. 4(b), the NH3–N content dramatically dropped with an increase in the ethanol volume. At 450 °C, its content decreased from 6800 mg L−1 without ethanol to 1599 mg L−1 with 20% ethanol. This decrease was attributed not only to the dilution of ethanol but also to the co-oxidation effect by comparing the experimental and calculated NH3–N contents. However, this acceleration contradicted Helling and Tester’s [51] experimental results. They measured the conversion rate of 2.45 mmol L−1 NH3 to be 5 ± 5% at 540 °C regardless of the addition of 0.67 mmol L−1 ethanol. A possible explanation was the difference in the ethanol contents. In our experiment, the nitrogen content shown in Table 2 was 5.7%. Supposing all the nitrogen in sludge was converted to NH3–N, the NH3–N content could reach 7436 mg L−1 (0.43 mol L−1). In our experiment, the content of even 5% ethanol achieved 0.29 mol L−1. This value was in the same order as the maximum NH3–N content which might appear in our study and was much higher than the ethanol content applied by Helling and Tester [51]. When the ethanol amount was too low, reactive radicals might be consumed by ethanol itself and therefore no co-oxidation effect could be observed."
10,Effect of isopropanol,"3.3 Effect of isopropanol Fig. 5 displays the effects 0–20% isopropanol on TOC and NH3–N contents of sludge at 450–600 °C, 20 min and n = 1.5. Similar to the addition of methanol and ethanol, isopropanol also promoted the degradation of TOC of NH3–N in sludge by comparing experimental and calculated contents. At 600 °C and with 20% isopropanol, the TOC content lowered to 162 mg L−1. However, similar to adding methanol or ethanol, NH3–N began to be removed only at 600 °C regarding the addition of IPA. At 600 °C, when the volume percent of isopropanol augmented from 0 to 20%, the corresponding NH3–N contents dropped from 520 mg L−1 to 107 mg L−1. At 550 °C, although the NH3–N content was higher than the initial NH3–N content in sludge and IPA mixture, it decreased from 4300 mg L−1 to 1054 mg L−1 as the addition of isopropanol changed from 0 to 20%. Chen et al. [52] reported that it was reactive radicals (HO·, HO2·, CH3COHCH3·, CH3· and CH3CHOHCH2O2·) produced by IPA that facilitated the oxidation of organics. Al-Duri et al. [53] also reported that 5 mmol L−1 isopropanol increased the X TOC of 5 mmol L−1 1,8-Diazabicyclo [5.4.0]undec-7-ene by 3.7% at 400 °C, n = 1 and 2 s. Cabeza et al. [27] observed that the variation of TOC contents in the liquid products was negligible when the mole ratios between IPA and NH3 changed from 0 to 1.5. In our experiment, their mole ratios increased from 2.78 to 13.19 as the volume percent of isopropanol changed from 5% to 20%, which were much higher than those used in Cabeza et al.’s [27] research. High content of active radicals brought about obvious TOC reduction by IPA in our study. Furthermore, for the degradation of NH3–N, Al-Duri et al. [53] reported that 5 mmol·L-1 isopropanol reduced the NH3–N content by 8% at 450 °C and by 5% at 520 °C when performing SCWO of 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. Cabeza et al. [27] pointed out that nitrogen removal rate increased by 10% when IPA/NH3 was 0.25 because of the formation OH and HO2 radicals through reactions between alcohol, water and oxygen. The studies above were all consistent with the promotion effect IPA observed in our research."
11,Comparison of different alcohols,"3.4 Comparison of different alcohols The supplementary material shows that the degradation difficulties of alcohol TOC were in the following orders: methanol > isopropanol > ethanol. Abelleira et al. [54] measured the removal rates of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol to be 98.2%, 99.4% and 90%, respectively. However, Rice and Croiset [35] reported that it took 3 s, 1.25 s and 1.6 s for methanol, ethanol and isopropanol respectively to reach 50% conversion rates at 430 °C. Boock and Klein [55] compared the degradation rates and carbon ratios in liquid products of these alcohols at 300 °C and 10 min. The conversion rates of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol were 0.18, 0.89 and 0.45, which gave carbon ratios in liquid products of 82%, 28% and 60%, respectively. Bourhis et al. [56] also recognized that ethanol was most reactive, followed by isopropanol and methanol, which was consistent with our results. Fig. 6 shows the effects of 0–20% alcohols on experimental X TOC at 450–600 °C. It was seen that X TOC was lower than 95% at 450 °C and 500 °C regardless of the volume percentages and types of alcohols. Nevertheless, X TOC reached 95.8% at 600 °C even without adding alcohols, indicating that the temperature played a more significant role in the degradation of TOC than co-oxidation. As shown in Fig. 6, X TOC with ethanol was the highest while X TOC with methanol was the lowest under the same conditions. At 500 °C, X TOC increased from 70.5% without alcohols to 93.9%, 94.7% and 94.3% after adding 20% methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, respectively. Therefore, the co-oxidation effects of alcohols on the removal of TOC in sludge were in the following order: ethanol > isopropanol > methanol. This order was consistent with the oxidation difficulty of alcohol themselves in SCW. Fig. 7 illustrates the effect of 0–20% alcohols on experiment X NH 3 - N at 600 °C because NH3–N was only obviously degraded at 600 °C. X NH 3 - N rose from 72.6% without alcohols to 79.6%, 84.7% and 82.4% with 20% methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, respectively. The co-oxidation effects of alcohols on the removal of NH3–N in sludge were in the same order as those of TOC (ethanol > isopropanol > methanol). There would be two reasons for the promotion effects of alcohols on the removal of TOC and NH3–N in sludge. One possible reason was that heat released by alcohols increased the reaction temperature. Another possible reason was that activated radicals which were released by alcohols accelerated the SCWO of sludge. The oxidation reaction equations of alcohols are presented from Eq. (13) to Eq. (15). It was calculated that 1 m3 methanol, ethanol and isopropanol released 15782 MJ, 21042 MJ and 23768 MJ heat respectively, indicating that isopropanol could reach the highest temperature in a given time. (13) CH3OH + 1.5O2 → CO2 + 2H2O ΔH = −638.46 kJ/mol (14) C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O ΔH = −1225.26 kJ/mol (15) C3H7OH + 4.5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O ΔH = −1816.69 kJ/mol However, the sand bath kept isothermal using the outer heat source in our experiment, therefore, heat released by alcohols was neglected. Consequently, the promotion effects of alcohols on the removal of TOC and NH3–N in sludge were only attributed to the activated radicals (e.g. HO2· and OH·) produced by alcohols (see Eqs. (16)–(20)). (16) H-ROH + O2 → ROH + HO2 (17) H2O + O2 → OH + HO2 (18) ROH + HO2 → RO + H2O2 (19) H-ROH + HO2 → ROH + H2O2 (20) H2O2 → 2OH"
12,HO2 and OH radicals released by alcohols,"3.5 HO2 and OH radicals released by alcohols DCKM calculations of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol were performed to explain the promotion roles of alcohols. The initial alcohol and O2 concentrations for calculation were listed in the loading detail tables in the supplementary materials. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the key steps of alcohol degradation. The supplementary material summarizes the five most sensitive reactions for 20% alcohol conversion at 450 °C. Most reactions contained HO2 and OH radicals. Section 3.1–3.4 also demonstrated that these two radicals might play an important role in co-oxidation reactions. The supplementary material also summarizes the five most sensitive reactions for the concentrations of HO2 and OH radicals produced by 20% alcohols at 450 °C. The production or consumption of HO2 and OH radicals also depended on their own and O2 concentrations. Consequently, we calculated the concentrations of HO2 and OH radicals, as well as the alcohol and O2 concentrations during the conversion of alcohols to compare the co-oxidation effects of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol on the degradation of sludge. Fig. 8 shows the calculated contents of alcohols, O2, HO2 and OH radicals at 450 °C with the initial alcohol concentration of 20%. As noted in Fig. 8(a) and (b), the conversion speeds of alcohols and the consumption speeds of O2 were in the following orders: ethanol > isopropanol > methanol, which were consistent with the removal rates obtained in our experiment. As shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d), the concentration of HO2 radicals was three orders of magnitude times as much as that of OH radicals. The HO2 radical concentration partly determined the OH· concentration since HO2 reacted with HO2 or H2O to form H2O2, which dissociated to form the OH radical (see Eqs. (21–23)) [57]. Ethanol produced the highest contents of HO2 radical in the shortest time, followed by isopropanol and methanol, which might explain the promotion orders of co-oxidation (ethanol > isopropanol > methanol). (21) HO2 + HO2 = H2O2 + O2 (22) HO2 + H2O = H2O2 + OH (23) H2O2 = OH + OH Fig. 9 shows the concentrations of HO2 and OH radicals produced by SCWO of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol with different concentrations at 450 °C. As shown in Fig. 9, regardless of the type of alcohols, increasing the volume percent of alcohols not only increased the peak contents of HO2 and OH radicals but also shortened the peak appearance time. The peak concentration of HO2 radicals produced by 20% methanol was 5.62 times as much as that produced by 5% methanol and appeared 2.25 s in advance. The variation of OH radicals behaved in the similar way as that of HO2 radicals. As a result, increasing the volume percent of alcohols enabled the rapid and high production of HO2 and OH radicals, thus enhancing the possibility for sludge to capture these reactive radicals and further increasing the removal rate of TOC and NH3–N."
13,Effect of alcohols on organics in liquid products by GC–MS and FT–IR analyses,"3.6 Effect of alcohols on organics in liquid products by GC–MS and FT–IR analyses GC–MS analyses were performed to determine the types of organics in liquid products. We chose the samples obtained at 450 °C with or without 20% alcohols. Both strong polar (HP-INNOWax Polyethylene Glycol) and low polar (Rxi-5Sil MS) columns were applied to acquire the comprehensive compositions of liquid products. Total ion chromatograms of the liquid products were presented in the supplementary material. Peak numbers in the chromatograms significantly reduced after the addition of alcohols regardless of the column types applied, showing the liquid compositions after adding alcohols were simpler than those without alcohols. In addition, with strong polar column and after adding alcohols, the number and intensity of peaks which appeared prior to 40 min significantly decreased, suggesting the reduction of low polar products with small molecular when alcohols were added. Organics were manually divided into non-nitrogen open chain compounds (NNO), nitrogen open chain compounds (NO), non-nitrogen aromatic compounds (NNA), nitrogen aromatic compounds (NA) and non-aromatic ring compounds (NAC). Compounds with a relative proportion by area higher than 1% and the total average relative molecular weight (RMW) are exhibited in Table 4 (measured by GC–MS with a strong polar column) and Table 5 (measured by GC–MS with a low polar column). Detailed compound identification of compounds in liquid products is summarized in the supplementary materials. As shown in Table 4, total average RMW increased from 215 without alcohols to more than 320 with 20% alcohols when strong polar column was applied. These large molecular compounds originated from NNO. The relative proportion by area of NNO increased from 14.7% without alcohols to approximate 60% with 20% alcohols. By contrast, the relative proportion by area of NNA decreased from 24.1% to lower than 5% and the proportion of NA decreased from 35.5% to less than 2%. NO and NAR appeared after adding alcohols although their relative proportions by area were low. The same results were also obtained in Table 5 when the low polar column was used. In conclusion, alcohols inhibited the productions of NNA and NA in liquid products but promoted the generation of NNO. NNO mainly consisted of alkanes and carboxylic acids. These compounds were easily degraded. By contrast, NNA comprised benzene homologs, phenols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Most NA contained pyridine, naphthyridine and quinolone substances. NNA and NA were very refractory because of the delocalized π bond in the benzene ring. Phenols and pyridines were stable even at 550 °C and n = 4 [7]. Phenols were also regarded as the last hurdle to reach complete disposal in SCW [58] while NA was able to capture the free radicals [59]. As a result, promotion effects of alcohols on the co-oxidation of sludge also originated form the suppression of refractory NNA, NA and the promotion of easily degradable NNO, thus enhancing the removal of TOC and NH3–N in sludge. FT–IR analyses were performed on the same samples as GC–MS experiment to further investigate the influences of alcohols on the functional groups in liquid products. Fig. 10 shows the FT–IR spectra for the liquid products with or without alcohols. It was observed that no matter whether adding alcohols or not, the strongest absorbance of the stretch vibration in CH2 group at 2925 cm−1 appeared, indicating that long-chain alkanes predominated in the liquid products regardless of the addition of alcohols, which was consistent with the GC–MS results. Although peaks at 2960 cm−1 and 2855 cm−1 were not as obvious as those at 2925 cm−1, these peaks also verified the long-chain alkanes in the liquid products. CO and asymmetrical COO– stretching vibrations in aliphatic acids appeared between 1750 and 1540 cm−1. These vibrations weakened when alcohols were added because of esterification reactions between alcohols and aliphatic acids. In addition, without the addition of alcohols, there were many obvious peaks within the range of 860 cm−1 and 670 cm−1 (CH out-of-plane bending in the benzene rings), as well as a wide absorption peak at 3368 cm−1 (OH stretching band in COH group), showing the presence of phenols. By contrast, when adding 20% alcohols, although significant peaks emerged around 3400 cm−1, absorbance between 860 cm−1 and 670 cm−1 was weak, suggesting the presence of unconverted alcohols or hydrolyzed sugars and the decrease in the amount of compounds containing benzene rings, which accorded with the inhibition of NNA and NA by alcohols obtained by the GC–MS results. FT–IR further indicated that the addition of alcohols restrained the recalcitrant products, thus encouraging the decomposition of TOC and NH3–N in sludge."
14,Effects of alcohols on solid products,"3.7 Effects of alcohols on solid products Fig. 11 illustrates the element analyses for dried sludge and solid products from SCWO of sludge without alcohols or with either methanol, ethanol and isopropanol as co-solvent at 450 °C, 25 MPa, 20 min and n = 1.5 by EDS. The carbon contents in sludge products dramatically decreased after SCWO process and further dropped from 10.5% to lower than 8.5% with the addition of alcohols. The carbon content with ethanol was the lowest (5.9%), followed by isopropanol (6.5%) and methanol (8.3%). It indicated that alcohols promoted the conversion or hydrolysis of carbon in solid products. The supplementary material presents the pictures of dry sludge and the solid products. The color of solid products converted from black to khaki when alcohols were added. The solids in khaki might be sand and inorganics, which also implied that the decomposition of organics in solid products was almost thorough. TGA was performed to further characterize the solid products. Fig. 12 shows the thermogravimetric (TG) and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curves of dried and solid products with or without the addition of alcohols, as well as the heating profiles. In the TG profile, weight losses of solid products significantly decreased after SCWO reaction at 450 °C. Supposing that the combustion products only consisted of ash after TGA program at 800 °C, it was calculated that the solid ratio (the mass of solid products divided by the mass of the dried sludge in the feedstock) decreased from 33.4% with no alcohol to 31.2%, 30.2% and 30.3% at 450 °C with 20% methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, respectively. The weight losses of solid products with alcohols were approximately 1/3 as many as those without alcohols, indicating that the decrease in organics after adding alcohols. The weight losses rate order of solid products were ethanol < isopropanol < methanol, suggesting the lowest organic contents in solid products when ethanol was added as co-oxidation addictive. The DTG curves also presented the same trend as TG profile."
15,Conclusions,"Methanol, ethanol and isopropanol all exhibited co-oxidation accelerated effects on TOC and NH3–N removal rates of sludge. One reason was that alcohols provided reactive HO2 and OH radicals. Another reason was that GC–MS and FT–IR results show that alcohols inhibited the generation of refractory products (non-nitrogen and nitrogen aromatic compounds) and promoted the production of easily degradable species (non-nitrogen open chain compounds). The co-oxidation promotion effects were in the following order: ethanol > isopropanol > methanol by analyzing the TOC and NH3–N contents in liquid products, by comparing the carbon contents in solid products through EDS analyses and by measuring the weight loss of solid products via TGA analyses. Through radical calculation using the detailed chemical kinetics models developed in our study, ethanol was able to produce the highest contents of HO2 radicals in the shortest reaction time, followed by isopropanol and methanol. This order was also consistent with the oxidation difficulty of the alcohols themselves in supercritical water. By increasing the volume percent of alcohols, more HO2 and OH radicals were produced in a shorter time, thus enhancing the co-oxidation effects. The peak concentration of HO2 radical produced by 20% methanol was 5.62 times as much as that produced by 5% methanol and appeared 2.25 s in advance."
