0,Introduction,"With a wide range of selection, lignocellulose are most abundant renewable resources in the world (Chen et al., 2015). Among them, the potential of agricultural and forestry biomass is huge, and the production of biofuels or biomaterials using them has become an important development strategy in many countries (Peng et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). In particular, the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bioethanol has attracted the attention of experts around the world (Zhao et al., 2017a). The development of cellulosic ethanol technology is a win-win model for reducing costs and protecting the environment. This is conducive to the sustainable development of human society and is consistent with the low-carbon green theme of today’s world (Zhao et al., 2017b). In the preparation of cellulosic ethanol, pretreatment is one of the key steps in lignocellulosic biorefining (Xia et al., 2019). The pretreatment of lignocellulose to reduce its recalcitrance is a necessity to achieve highly efficient enzymatic saccharification (Wang et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2016a). Pretreatment can break the encapsulation and entanglement of cellulose by hemicellulose and lignin, change the physicochemical properties of plant cell walls, destroy the hydrogen bond network connection that causes the crystal structure of cellulose, and increase the biomass specific surface area and porosity (Sun et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2014a). The treated-substrate properties are changed, and the biomass recalcitrance is reduced, thereby increasing the contact of the enzyme with cellulose and the yield of fermentable sugar (Qiao et al., 2018). So far, physical, chemical, physicochemical and biological methods are the main traditional pretreatments methods for biomass (Rabemanolontsoa and Saka, 2016). With the development of technology, new pretreatment technologies such as green solvents and ionic liquids have emerged (Hu et al., 2012; Wen et al., 2014). Generally speaking, physical pretreatments have limited influence on the fine structure of lignocellulose, which is often used as an assistant pretreatment method (Robertson et al., 2017). Chemical pretreatments erode equipment and bring certain pollution to the environment (Hassan et al., 2017). Biological pretreatment method has low energy consumption and environment friendly, but its long pre-processing time and production cycle limit its application in industrialization (Zhao et al., 2020). From the perspective of pretreatment effect, the physical methods such as steam explosion and hydrothermal process have very limited damage to the cellulose crystallinity, and they have little effect on the of lignin removal and structure changes (Zhao et al., 2017a). The acid-base pretreatment can effectively change the composition of treated substrate. The effect of acid pretreatment is mainly on hemicellulose removal, while the effect of alkali pretreatment is mainly on lignin removal. It is reported that acid pretreatment cannot destroy the cellulose crystallinity, while alkali pretreatment can be effectively to destroy it (Barakat et al., 2014). In general, traditional single pretreatment has certain disadvantage that limit its application. Many scholars have begun to realize that single pretreatment cannot simultaneously pretreat the three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) of biomass. A combination of various pretreatments is a possible way of pretreatment technology. In recent years, the combined pretreatments have gradually become a research hotspot. Two-step pretreatment combined of chemical and biological pretreatment of rice hull was proposed to reduce the biological process time. The combined pretreatment of H2O2 (2%, 48 h) and P. ostreatus (18 d) could significantly shorten the process period (from 60 d to 18 d) and increase the total soluble sugar yield (Yu et al., 2009). Zhang et al. studied the alkali combined extrusion pretreatment of corn stover to improve the enzymatic hydrolysis. Results showed that the extrusion could open the cell wall and increase the porosity after pretreatment. Therefore, it greatly increased the adsorption area of enzyme. The glucose and xylose yield for optional combined process are 86.8% and 50.5% respectively (Zhang et al., 2012). Pang et al. proposed a combined steam explosion and microwave irradiation (SE-MI) process for corn stover. SE-MI pretreatment gives a 19% lower biomass crystallinity than that of SE pretreatment only (Pang et al., 2013). A combined biological (microbial) and chemical (dilute acid) process was put forward to pretreatment of water hyacinth. It gives the highest cellulose content of 39.4% and a reducing sugars production of 430.66 mg/g under the optimized pretreatment conditions (Zhang et al., 2018). Yang et al. propose two different methods of combined physical and chemical pretreatments to enhance hydrogen generation from grass waste, named as combined ionizing radiation-acid pretreatment (Yang and Wang, 2018) and combined ultrasound-dilute acid pretreatment (Yang and Wang, 2019) respectively. Owing to the destroyed biomass structure and crystallinity, the hydrogen yield increases about 1.6–3.1 times than that of raw material. Microbial community analysis shows that the Clostridium sensu stricto 1 of combined pretreatment increases from 37.9%–69.4%, which is more conducive to hydrogen fermentation (Yang and Wang, 2018, 2019). A recent study applies a combined fungal and diluted acid method on wood biomass. It reveals that the order of the pretreatment combination has a significant influence on the sugar yield, and the optimized pretreatment condition is fungal pretreatment with I. lacteus after 28 d followed by diluted acid pretreatment (2% w/v H2SO4, 130 °C and 90 min). It is reported that the combined pretreatment improves enzymatic hydrolysis yield of 34% when compares with that of acid pretreatment alone (Martínez-Patiño et al., 2018). Si et al. develops a bio-strategy combined biological with chemical pretreatment. They reveal that the ligninolytic bacterium of Pandoraea sp. B-6 improves the sugar release (40.9%) of acid-treated rice straw by removing acidolysis-caused residual lignin, and the saccharolytic bacterium of Acinetobacter sp. B − 2 improves the sugar release (31.8%) of alkali-treated rice straw by decrystallization. This complementary effect of combined bacterial-chemical pretreatment gives a new basis for developing a reasonable combination process (Si et al., 2019). For the disadvantages of traditional ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) process, a combined hydrogen peroxide and ammonia fiber expansion (H-AFEX) pretreatment is developed in our laboratory (Zhao et al., 2014b). Results show that both lignin removal and sugar yield are enhanced when applying the H-AFEX pretreatment to corn leaf or energy crops (Zhao et al., 2016a, 2017a). The effect of H-AFEX pretreatment on the surface morphology and structural characteristics of H-AFEX-treated substrates are qualitatively analyzed (Zhao et al., 2016b). So far, a large number of combined pretreatments have been developed and reported. However, most of the emerging combined pretreatments are still just the process optimization. On the one hand, the mechanism of combined pretreatment remains to be further studied. One the other hand, the synergistic effect of combined pretreatment is often overlooked. From the existing literature, some research progress has been made on the effect of H-AFEX pretreatment on lignin (Qiao et al., 2018). However, the synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia on lignin remains to be further studied. In this study, we will focus on the synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia on lignin. Ball-milled wood lignins were isolated from corn stover of untreated, hydrogen peroxide pretreatment alone, AFEX pretreatment alone and combined H-AFEX pretreatment. The range and effect of separate pretreatment and combined pretreatment on lignin were compared by the changes of elemental analysis, molecular weight, structure and linkage. The synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia on lignin of H-AFEX pretreatment was assessed. The study would reveal the mechanism of combined H-AFEX pretreatment and explain the relationship between lignin and biomass recalcitrance."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals The corn stover were collected in August 2015 from local farm, Lin'an, Zhejiang Province, People’s Republic of China. After cutting into 3−5 cm long strips, the cut samples were dried in an oven for 24 h. Then they were crushed into powder by FZ102 micro-plant pulverizer. The milled samples were screened by 40−60 mesh and then sealed in plastic bags and kept at −20 °C for later use. Hydrogen peroxide solutions (30 wt.%) was bought from Tongsheng Chemical Co. Ltd, Jiangsu Province, People’s Republic of China. Ammonia was bought from Longsan Chemical Co. Ltd, Zhejiang Province, People’s Republic of China. Benzene, ethanol, dioxane, dichloromethane, and pyridine, were bought from Sino-pharm Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd, Beijing, People’s Republic of China. Aether, Acetic acid and acetic anhydride were bought from Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd, Shanghai, People’s Republic of China. Trichloromethane was bought from Xi-long Scientific Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd, Guangdong Province, People’s Republic of China. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used directly."
3,Pretreatments,"2.2 Pretreatments In this study, we focused on the synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia on lignin rather than the optimization of pretreatment process parameters. Therefore, we directly adopted the experimental parameters based on the published papers. The pretreatment conditions of hydrogen peroxide (HP), AFEX and H-AFEX processes were determined according to previous literature (Zhao et al., 2014a, b, 2016b). The detail of each pretreatment was described as follow. For HP pretreatment, 50 g dry basis corn stover was mixed with 50 g of 30% hydrogen peroxide solution (1.0 hydrogen peroxide loading, the weight ratio of 30% hydrogen peroxide solution to dry biomass). Then the mixed sample was placed into a water bath at 60 °C for 60 min. The treated sample was cooled down naturally to room temperature and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h. The dried samples were sealed in plastic bags and kept at −20 °C for later use. For AFEX pretreatment, 50 g dry basis corn stover was mixed with deionized water to reach 0.7 water loading (the weight ratio of water to dry biomass). Then the mixed sample was placed into a high-pressure reactor. Inject 50 g of liquid ammonia to the reactor for obtaining 1.0 ammonia loading (the weight ratio of ammonia to dry biomass). The AFEX process was treated at 130 °C for 10 min. Then, the treated corn stover was cooled down naturally to room temperature and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h. The dried samples were sealed in plastic bags and kept at −20 °C for later use. For H-AFEX pretreatment, it was similar to AFEX process with the addition of hydrogen peroxide solution premixed. 50 g dry basis corn stover with a 0.7 water loading was mixed with 30% hydrogen peroxide solution at 0.5 hydrogen peroxide loading. The mixed corn stover was done AFEX process with the same pretreatment condition (1.0 ammonia loading, 130 °C for 10 min). The treated corn stover was cooled to room temperature and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h. The dried samples were sealed in plastic bags and kept at −20 °C for later use."
4,Isolation of ball-milled wood lignin and its acetylation,"2.3 Isolation of ball-milled wood lignin and its acetylation Four kinds of ball-milled wood lignins were isolated from untreated and pretreated corn stover, named as UN-L (lignin isolated from untreated corn stover), HP-L (lignin isolated from HP-treated corn stover), AFEX-L (lignin isolated from AFEX-treated corn stover), and H-AFEX-L (lignin isolated from H-AFEX-treated corn stover), respectively. The preparation of lignin consisted of four steps: (1) benzene-ethanol and hot water extraction, (2) ball mill, (3) lignin isolation and (4) purification. The detail of each step was shown in Fig. 1 . The purified lignin was used for elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis. The purified lignin was further acetylated for improving the solubility in deuterium solvent before the determination of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The detail of lignin acetylation was performed as previously described (Qiao et al., 2018)."
5,Elemental analysis,"2.4 Elemental analysis The elemental analysis of the purified lignins were characterized by an elemental analyzer (Elementar, varioEL Ⅲ, Germany). The main contents of C, H and N element in lignin were measured directly, while the content of O element was calculated by subtraction."
6,Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis,"2.5 Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis The molecular weight and polydispersity index of the acetylated lignins were characterized by a gel chromatograph (Waters 515, MA, USA). 4 Waters styragel chromatographic columns (HR 0.5, HR 2, HR 4, and HR 6) and an ultraviolet detector (270 nm) were equipped for this gel chromatograph. For the GPC analysis, the calibration was performed with polystyrene standards. The acetylated lignin was dissolved into tetrahydrofuran as a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The mobile phase was tetrahydrofuran with a flow rate of 1 mL/min."
7,FT-IR analysis,"2.6 FT-IR analysis The FT-IR spectra of purified lignins were characteristic by a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS5 (Thermo Nicolet Corp., Madison, WI, USA). 1−2 mg of lignin was ground and compressed with 100−200 mg of potassium bromide (KBr). The spectra were scanned in the range of 4000−500 cm−1 at the resolution of 2 cm−1. Each sample was scanned 32 times."
8,Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis,"2.7 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis 13C−1H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments were conducted on a Bruker AVIII 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Around 35 mg of acetylated lignin was dissolved in 0.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). The spectral widths for the 13C analysis was 200.0 ppm, while that of 1H analysis was 11.0 ppm. The other HSQC acquisition parameters are as follows: 90° pulse angle, 0.15 s acquisition time, 1.5 s pulse delay, 1JC–H of 145 Hz, and 32 scans. The spectra were processed using Bruker Topspin-NMR processing software."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effect of different pretreatments on lignin elemental composition,"3.1 Effect of different pretreatments on lignin elemental composition The elemental composition results of four different kinds of lignins are shown in Table 1 . The contents of C, H, O and N of UN-L were 61.48%, 9.40%, 28.90% and 0.23%, respectively. A small amount of N content was detected in UN-L because of the protein which was closely associated with lignin. The phenomenon that corn stover lignin is contaminated by protein has also been found in previous study (Lei et al., 2013). After pretreatment, the C content had a different degree of decrease (55.73 − 59.24%), and the H-AFEX-L, which was 55.73%, had the lowest C content. The synergistic effect was observed between hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. The O contents of HP-L and H-AFEX-L pretreatment were 35.91% and 33.95% respectively, which were higher than those of UN-L (28.90%) and AFEX-L (29.13%), indicating that lignin oxidation occurred at the presence of hydrogen peroxide. A study revealed the mechanism of alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment from the role of hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide decomposes to form intermediates including superoxide and hydroxyl radicals under alkaline conditions, then to form oxygen and water. Part of the oxygen is involved in the lignin degradation reaction and incorporated into oxidized lignin products (Gould, 1985). Therefore, the O content of lignin after alkaline peroxide pretreatment was increased. On the other hand, the N contents of AFEX-L and H-AFEX-L were 2.98% and 3.19% respectively, which were much higher than those of UN-L (0.23%) or HP-L (0.37%), suggesting that lignin ammonolysis occurred at the presence of ammonia. Similar phenomenon of increased N content is observed in anhydrous ammonia pretreatment. For example, the N content of extractive-ammonia (EA) pretreatment increases to 2.3% (Da Costa Sousa et al., 2016a). According to previous studies, the ammonolysis of cell wall takes place during the anhydrous ammonia pretreatment, and the isolated lignin is doped with nitrogen to form a new nitrogen-containing compound (Chundawat et al., 2011; Da Costa Sousa et al., 2016b). In general, oxidation and ammonolysis were the main reactions during H-AFEX pretreatment. Oxidation was dominated by hydrogen peroxide, while ammonolysis was dominated by ammonia. Furthermore, the N content of H-AFEX-L was higher than that of AFEX pretreatment alone. On the contrary, the O content of H-AFEX-L was lower than that of HP pretreatment alone. It was concluded that the synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia strengthened ammonolysis and weakened oxidation effect at the same time."
11,Effect of different pretreatments on lignin molecular weight,"3.2 Effect of different pretreatments on lignin molecular weight The molecular weights and polydispersity index (PI) of four different kinds of lignins are shown in Table 2 . In the polymer, the number average molecular weight (Mn) mainly depends on the low molecular weight fraction therein, and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) mainly depends on the high molecular weight fraction therein (Da Costa Sousa et al., 2016b). From the GPC analysis, the Mn and Mw of the UN-L were 4699 and 7751 g/mol respectively. After pretreatment, the Mn and Mw had a different degree of decrease. AFEX pretreatment gave the greatest destructive effect on lignin, and the Mn and Mw of the AFEX-L had the lowest values, which were 2353 and 3925 g/mol respectively. Compared with those of UN-L, the Mn and Mw of the AFEX-L reduced by 49.9% and 49.4%. This indicated that either low molecular weight fraction or high molecular weight fraction of lignin during AFEX pretreatment was sufficiently degraded. Generally speaking, the molecular weight of lignin deceased after pretreatment due to the breakage of internal bonds (Da Costa Sousa et al., 2016a; Hu et al., 2012; Wen et al., 2013). On the other hand, the increase of lignin molecular weight was also observed in many pretreatments, such as AFEX pretreatment of switchgrass (Shao and Zhao, 2016), steam explosion pretreatment of aspen wood (Populus tremula L.) (Li et al., 2007), dilute acid pretreatment of corn stover and hydrothermal pretreatment of corn stover (Pu et al., 2013). It is agreed that depolymerization and condensation of lignin occurred simultaneously during most pretreatment (Shuai et al., 2016). The fragmentation makes the lignin molecular weight smaller, while the condensation makes it larger. Therefore, the change in the molecular weight of lignin depends upon the result of competition between fragmentation and condensation (Shao and Zhao, 2016). If the depolymerization is greater than the condensation, the molecular weight of lignin decreases, if the condensation is greater than depolymerization, it increases. According to published literature, the condensation reaction usually occurs in the later stage of the pretreatment or under more severe pretreatment conditions such as higher reaction temperature and longer reaction time (Pu et al., 2013; Shuai et al., 2016). Therefore, the decrease of lignin molecular weight during AFEX pretreatment of corn stover in this study might be partially caused by a residence time of 10 min, while the increase of lignin molecular weight during AFEX pretreatment of switchgrass might be partially caused by an extended residence time of 30 min (Shao and Zhao, 2016). It is an interesting topic to study the effect of reaction conditions on the molecular weight of lignin and how to prevent the condensation of lignin during pretreatment, which is also the further investigation of this study. A recent study reported that adding formaldehyde during biomass pretreatment could prevent lignin condensation by forming 1,3-dioxane structures with lignin side-chain hydroxyl groups (Shuai et al., 2016). Compared with those of UN-L, the Mn of the HP-L decreased from 4699 to 3786 g/mol and that of Mw decreased from 7751 to 6259 g/mol. This indicated that the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the molecular weight of lignin was limited. Compared with that of HP pretreatment alone, The Mw of the H-AFEX-L decreased greatly from 6259 to 4954 g/mol, indicating that ammonia was the main driving force for degrading the high molecular weight fraction of lignin. It was concluded that ammonia had a significant effect on the Mw of lignin. The PI refers the relative different molecular weight fraction therein the polymer compounds. The higher the PI, the larger the difference in molecular weight fraction therein polymer, and vice versa. The PI of polymer has a great influence on its performance. Generally speaking, the higher the PI, the worse the performance. Even if the molecular weight is low, a higher PI may be obtained because of the wider distribution of molecular weight fraction (Brenelli et al., 2016). The PI of UN-L was 1.649, and those of HP-L and AFEX-L were 1.653 and 1.668, respectively. The almost unchanged PI of HP-L and AFEX-L indicated that the lignin with large and small molecular weight fraction were degraded simultaneously during HP and AFEX pretreatment. The results showed that HP and AFEX pretreatments had no selection to the degradation of lignin in terms of molecular weight, and the degradation degree of lignin in large or small fragments was almost consistent. A slightly increased PI of AFEX-L was resulted from the severe degradation of lignin into heterogeneous fragments. Similar phenomenon is observed in many studies. The PI of lignin increases from 1.99 to 2.19 when switchgrass is pretreated by AFEX (Shao and Zhao, 2016), and it increases from 2.5 to 3.6 when switchgrass is pretreated by ethanol organosolv (Hu et al., 2012). The H-AFEX-L gave the lowest PI among the four different kinds of lignins. Compared with UN-L, it decreased from 1.649 to 1.296, indicating that large molecular weight fragments of lignin were selectively degraded during H-AFEX pretreatment. After H-AFEX pretreatment, the molecular weight distribution of lignin was narrow, and the molecular structure was homogeneous under the synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. It could be seen that H-AFEX pretreatment could not only effectively degrade lignin, but also greatly reduce its PI. The H-AFEX-L was purified, which gave a better foundation for its subsequent efficient utilization."
12,FT-IR analysis of lignins isolated from different pretreatments,"3.3 FT-IR analysis of lignins isolated from different pretreatments The FT-IR spectrum of the four different kinds of lignins are shown in Fig. 2 , and the assignment of the corresponding bands are listed in Table 3 . The assignments of infrared absorption bands of lignin are determined according to previous studies (Hu et al., 2012; Wen et al., 2013). The 1711 cm−1 band represents non-conjugated carbonyl (CO). This band was clearly visible in UN-L and HP-L, whereas it almost disappeared in AFEX-L and H-AFEX-L, indicating that ammonia acted on the carbonyl group. The bands at 1602, 1516 and 1421 cm−1, which were related the vibration of aromatic skeleton, showed little changes in the intensity of the four different kinds of lignins, suggesting that either ammonia or hydrogen peroxide couldn’t damage the aromatic skeleton. According to previous studies, the aromatic skeleton of lignin is very stable and almost no changes in many pretreatments, such as alkaline hydrogen peroxide of Dendrocalamus sinicus (He et al., 2017), hot water pretreatment of corn stover (Pu et al., 2013), ionic liquid pretreatment of Birch (Wen et al., 2013) and AFEX pretreatment of corn stover (Zhao et al., 2016b). The bands at 1261 and 1020 cm−1 represents the CO stretch and CH vibration in guaiacyl ring. These two bands were particularly remarkable in UN-L, whereas they almost disappeared in HP-L and AFEX-L, and the corresponding bands decreased significantly in H-AFEX-L. This indicated that both of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide could act on G unit lignin, and the degradation of G unit in HP or AFEX pretreatment alone was more fiercely than that of combined pretreatment. This is consistent with previous study. Demethylation selectively takes place in G unit lignin when the Birch is pretreated by ionic liquid (Wen et al., 2013). The band at 1120 and 1097 cm−1 represents ether bond. A significantly decrease in intensity of this peak from pretreated lignins suggested that either ammonia or hydrogen peroxide could disrupt the ether bonds in lignin."
13,2D-HSQC analysis of lignins isolated from different pretreatments,"3.4 2D-HSQC analysis of lignins isolated from different pretreatments The side-chain region (13C/1H, 50−90/3.0−5.5 ppm) of the HSQC spectra of the four different kinds of lignins are shown in Fig. 3 . The assignments of 13C/1H correlation signals are listed in Table 4 according to previous studies (Del Río et al., 2015; Samuel et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2013). As shown in Fig. 3, the cross peak at δC/δH 64.9/4.8 was assigned to the Cγ/Hγ correlations of I′γ. This peak was clearly visible in UN-L. After pretreatment, this signal disappeared, followed by the signal of Iγ (δC/δH 62.2/4.1), indicating that both of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide could act on the alkyl ether bond of lignin side chain. The cross peak at δC/δH 64.0/4.3 was assigned to the Cγ/Hγ correlations of A′γ. Compared with that of UN-L, the intensity of this signal significantly reduced in either AFEX-L or H-AFEX-L, whereas the signal was almost no intensity change in HP-L, indicating that the dominant force causing ester bond cleavage was ammonia rather than hydrogen peroxide. The destruction of ester bonds by liquid ammonia has been confirmed by many studies. During EA process, the biomass is immersed in liquid ammonia at equilibrium. During this period, lignin is partly dissolved in the liquid ammonia by the cleavage of the ester bonds and a cellulose-ammonia complex is formed at the same time (Da Costa Sousa et al., 2016b). A study by Chundawat et al. reveals the mechanism of AFEX pretreatment. Ammonia penetrates the cell walls and cleave various ester linkages through a series of hydrolytic and ammonolytic reactions (Chundawat et al., 2011). The cross peak at δC/δH 83.7/5.1 was assigned to the Cα/Hα correlations of Bα. Compared with that of UN-L, the intensity of this signal significantly reduced in HP-L, whereas the signal was almost no intensity change in either AFEX-L or H-AFEX-L, indicating that the dominant force causing β − β bond cleavage of lignin was hydrogen peroxide rather than ammonia. This is consistent with alkaline hydrogen peroxide of Dendrocalamus sinicus (He et al., 2017). The cross peak at δC/δH 71.0/3.6 was assigned to the Cγ/Hγ correlations of Cγ. As shown in Fig. 3, almost the same signal intensity was observed in four different kinds of lignins, suggesting that the p-coumaran structure remained stable during the pretreatment of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. The stability of p-coumaran structure agrees with corn stalk cooking with solid alkali and H2O2 pretreatment (Yang et al., 2012). The increase of β − 5 linkage is observed when corn stover pretreatment by mild sodium hydroxide, which indicates that the p-coumaran structure is stable and lignin probably becomes more condensed in alkaline peroxide pretreatment (Min et al., 2014). In a conclusion, both of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide could act on the cleavage of alkyl ether bond of lignin side chain. However, both of them had a limited influence on the p-coumaran structure. Ammonia selectively degraded the ester bond, while hydrogen peroxide selectively degraded the resinol structure. The aromatic region (13C/1H, 90−150/6.0−8.0 ppm) of the HSQC spectra of the four different kinds of lignin are shown in Fig. 4 , and the assignments of 13C/1H correlation signals are also listed in Table 4 according to previous studies (Del Río et al., 2015; Samuel et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2013). The cross peaks at δC/δH 94.9/6.6 and 98.7/6.2 were assigned to the C8/H8 and C6/H6 correlations of tricin. Tricin is prevalent in grass lignin, especially in less lignified regions of plant (Del Río et al., 2011). These peaks were clearly visible in UN-L, and they disappeared after pretreatments, indicating that both of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide could act on the breakage of aryl ether bonds. The occurrence of intense signals for S2,6, G2, G5 and G6 were observed at δC/δH 104.3/6.7, 111.6/7.0, 115.4/6.8 and 119.5/6.8 ppm in all different kinds of linins respectively, indicating that the corn stover lignin was mainly G-S lignin. Although most studies have shown that corn stover lignin is G-S-H lignin. However, the H unit in corn stover lignin is account for a very small amount (about 1−2%) (Lei et al., 2013). The cross peak at δC/δH 104.7/7.3 was assigned to the C2/H2 and C6/H6 correlations of S′2,6. Compared with that of UN-L, the intensity of this signal increased significantly in HP-L, indicating that the action site of oxidation reaction during HP pretreatment was S unit. Moreover, the oxidation of S unit was observed in H-AFEX-L. The cross peak at δC/δH 130.2/7.7 was assigned to the C2/H2 and C6/H6 correlations of H2,6. The intense signals of pretreated lignins (HP-L, AFEX-L and H-AFEX-L) were clearly visible compared with that of UN-L. Combined with the FT-IR analysis, it was concluded that the G unit of lignin was transformed to H unit through demethoxylation reaction. The reduction of G units of lignin also occurs during AFEX pretreatment of switchgrass. Compared with that of untreated lignin, the ratio of S/G units of AFEX-treated lignin increases from 0.81 to 0.85 (Shao and Zhao, 2016). Samuel et al. believes that G unit of lignin has the most biomass recalcitrance to hydrolysis among the three monomers of lignin, and the degradation of G unit of lignin is beneficial to the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis (Samuel et al., 2011). The cross peaks at δC/δH 145.4/7.4 and 114.5/6.3 were assigned to the Cα/Hα and Cβ/Hβ correlations of FA and PCA. The occurrence of intense signals of FA and PCA in UN-L and HP-L were observed, while those in AFEX-L and H-AFEX-L were significantly reduced. It showed that the action sites of ammonolysis reaction were the ester bonds of FA and PCA. The cross peaks at δC/δH 140.0/7.3 and 119.4/6.4 were assigned to the Cα/Hα and C3,5/H3,5 correlations of FAM and PCAM. These signals were observed in AFEX-L and H-AFEX-L, and these were products and evidence of the lignin ammonolysis. The same phenomenon is found in other anhydrous ammonia-based pretreatments. The NMR analysis of AFEX-treated lignin reveals that most of ferulate and p-coumarate esters (about 85−90%) are cleaved via ammonolysis of cell wall during AFEX process, producing corresponding feruloyl amide and p-coumaroyl amide (Chundawat et al., 2010, 2011). Similar to the AFEX process, the feruloyl amide and p-coumaroyl amide which are identified in the EA-treated lignin are evidence of the cleavage of ester-linked ferulate and p-coumarate linkages (Da Costa Sousa et al., 2016a, b)."
14,Conclusion,"During ammonia and/or hydrogen peroxide pretreatment, oxidation was dominated by hydrogen peroxide, while ammonolysis was dominated by ammonia. The action site of oxidation was S unit, while that of ammonolysis were ferulate and p-coumarate esters. The corresponding feruloyl amide and p-coumaroyl amide were major reaction products of cell wall ammonolysis. The synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia strengthened ammonolysis effect whereas weakened oxidation effect. HP and AFEX pretreatments had no selection to the degradation of lignin in terms of molecular weight, while H-AFEX selectively degraded large molecular weight fragments of lignin. The synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia could not only effectively degrade lignin, but also greatly reduce its PI to obtain homogeneous lignin fragments. Ammonia selectively degraded the ester bond, while hydrogen peroxide selectively degraded the resinol structure. Both of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide could act on the cleavage of alkyl ether bonds and aryl ether bonds of lignin side chain. However, both of them had a limited influence on the p-coumaran structure. The understanding of synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia on lignin revealed the basic mechanism of H-AFEX pretreatment and provided insights into lignin structure and biomass recalcitrance, with a perspective of improving enzymatic hydrolysis, pretreatment selection and lignin utilization from biomass to biofuels."
