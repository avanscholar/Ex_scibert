0,Introduction,"A leading motivation in modern organic chemistry is the improvement of processes for chemical manipulation, in line with the global agenda for health, safety and sustainability. In this context, the search for more effective, selective and atom-economical reactions, that can be conducted under safe and mild conditions persists as a hot topic of intense research. It is widely known, and accepted by the generality of the chemical community, that transition metal catalysts enriched by suitable designed ligands represent powerful tools for practical catalysis. However, evidences to the difficulty of use of most of the applied metals (e.g. Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh) ascend, as a result of their low abundance, high toxicity and price [1]. Besides, the regulation of technical protocols to ensure more ecologically benign routes has been gaining strength, mostly from the beginning of the 21st century [2]. Thus, contemporary research devoted to the development of new synthetic methodologies is focused on the replacement of the classically used precious metals by cheaper and safer ones. In these circumstances, the use of zinc should be seriously considered, taking in account its divergent capabilities [3], abundance in the earth crust (near 75 ppm, 0.0075%) and biological relevance as an essential trace element (daily dose for humans 12–15 mg). However, in contrast to other metals, the use of zinc in catalysis is still underdeveloped. In 2013, Enthaler published a pleasant perspective article that exposes the applicability of easy accessible and versatile zinc complexes/salts in homogeneous catalysis, covering a significant group of chemical reactions, that span along reduction, oxidation and carbon dioxide functionalization processes [1]. This work boosted the growing interest in zinc-based catalysts as new tools for organic synthesis and, in recent years, their potential was explored in various contexts, but much work remains to be done in this field [4–13]. The development of amenable and selective methodologies for catalytic oxidation of several functional groups is a topic of notable relevance, due its impact on the preparation of a large number of added value molecules from cheap raw materials. In this scenario, selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds remains a hot topic in organic chemistry, both at laboratory and industrial level [14–19]. For the specific case of benzyl alcohols, the substrates on focus in this work, several catalytic systems for their oxidation emerged regularly along the last years. Recently, we have reported a novel organocatalyst as an excellent promotor for selective conversion of a series of benzyl alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes [19e]. Proceeding with our efforts towards the development of new tools for the chemical modification of benzyl alcohols, herein we disclose a relevant improvement on the oxidation of such substrates mediated by a novel homogeneous Zn(II) catalyst, using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in aqueous medium."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods Unless otherwise noted, solvents and starting materials were obtained from Aldrich. All chemicals used were of reagent grade without further purification before use. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 MN and aluminium-backed silica gel Merck 60 F254 plates were used for analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC). Melting points were recorded and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker Avance II 300 (UltraShield™ Magnet) spectrometer operating at 300 MHz (1H) and 75 MHz (13C). The chemical shifts are reported in ppm using TMS as internal standard. Carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen elemental analyses were carried out by the Microanalytical Service of the Instituto Superior Técnico – University of Lisbon. FT-IR spectra (4000-400 cm−1) were recorded on a VERTEX 70 (Bruker) spectrometer using KBr pellets. Mass spectra were obtained on a VG 7070E mass spectrometer by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV. The catalytic tests under microwave irradiation (MW) were performed in a focused Anton Paar Monowave 300 microwave reactor using a 10 mL capacity reaction tube with a 10 mm internal diameter, fitted with a rotational system and an IR temperature detector. Chromatographic analyses were performed in a Fisons Instruments GC 8000 series gas chromatograph with a DB-624 (J&W) capillary column (DB-WAX, column length: 30 m; internal diameter: 0.32 mm), FID detector and the Jasco-Borwin v.1.50 software; [GC conditions: Tinjection = 240 °C; Tinitial = 140 °C (1 min) raised 10 °C min–1 to 220 °C (1 min); carrier gas: He]. The internal standard method was used to quantify the organic products."
3,Preparation of the saccharyl building block,"2.2 Preparation of the saccharyl building block The saccharyl building block, saccharyl chloride (2), was synthesized from commercially available saccharin, through halogenation. 3-Chloro-1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide (1) was obtained from saccharin (10.2 g; 56 mmol) and phosphorus pentachloride (14.0 g; 66 mmol) heated at 180 °C, using a procedure previously reported [20]; colorless needles (7.00 g; 63% yield); m.p. 143–145 °C; IRνmax (cm−1): 1724, 1654, 1603 (CC), 1346 (SO2), 775 (Ar─H) and 692 (C─Cl); 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 7.72–7.91 (m, 4H, Ar─H); elemental analysis: C 41.5%, H, 2.0%, N, 6.9% (found), C, 41.7%, H, 2.0%, N, 7.0% (calculated for C7H4NO2SCl); MS (EI): m/z 201 [M+]."
4,Preparation of the tetrazolyl building block 4a,"2.3 Preparation of the tetrazolyl building block 4a [Tetrazolyl derivative 4a was prepared from commercially available 5-aminotetrazole monohydrate through methylation. This reaction produces a mixture of 1-methyl-(1H)-tetrazole-5-amine and 2-methyl-(2H)-tetrazole-5-amine. The regioisomers have different solubility and are separated during work-up, as described below.] A solution of sodium hydroxide (20% w/v) was added dropwise to a suspension of 5-aminotetrazole monohydrate (10.3 g; 0.1 mol) in water (30 mL), with a drop of phenolphthalein. The mixture was stirred until complete dissolution of the suspended material. Dimethyl sulfate (20 mL; 0.11 mol) was then added in small portions, keeping an alkaline medium through addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide. The final mixture was refluxed for 1 h, then cooled, and finally left in an ice bath, in the fridge, for 2 days. Colorless needles of 1-methyl-(1H)-tetrazole-5-amine (4b) were filtered, (6.1 g; 51% yield), m.p. 220–221 °C, 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 4.15 (s, 3H), MS (EI): m/z 99 [M+]. The filtrate collected was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford a solid residue. Water (50 mL) was added, and the mixture was then extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The organic extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated to afford white crystals. Recrystallization from diethyl ether gave 2-methyl-(2H)-tetrazole-5-amine (4a) as colorless needles (3.0 g, 25% yield), m.p. 104.5–105.5 °C, 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 3.32 (s, 3H), MS (EI): m/z 99 [M+]."
5,Preparation of the 2-methyltetrazole-saccharinate 5,"2.4 Preparation of the 2-methyltetrazole-saccharinate 5 A mixture of 2-methyl-(2H)-tetrazole-5-amine (0.25 g; 2.56 mmol) and 3-chloro-1,2-benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxide (0.53 g, 2.56 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL) was stirred at 60 °C during 24 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure and the remaining solid was washed with acetone, dried under vacuum at room temperature and recrystallized from a mixture of acetone/ethanol (1:1) to give the required product as colorless crystals (0.48 g; 72% yield), m.p. 285–286 °C, 1H NMR (DMSO): δ 8.49–8.50 (m, 1H), 8.10–8.13 (m, 1H), 7.90–7.92 (m, 2H), 4.42 (s, 3H), MS (EI): m/z 250 [M+]."
6,Preparation of the zinc complex 6,"2.5 Preparation of the zinc complex 6 To a 10 mL methanol/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) solution (1:2:2) of 2-methyltetrazole-saccharinate 5 (250 mg; 1.0 mmol) was added ZnSO4·H2O (179.5 mg; 1.0 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature until complete dissolution of the solids. The resulting colorless solution was kept in open air at room temperature for crystallization. After 8 days, single white crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated, [270 mg; 38% yield; (76% yield based on ligand 5)]. Elemental analysis (%): C, 34.04, H, 3,45, N, 23.81 (found); C, 34.02, H, 3,43, N, 23.80 (calculated for C20H26N12O7S3Zn). IR (KBr; cm−1): 3455 ν(OH), 1615, 1570, 1417, 1283 ν(C–N), 1245, 1152 ν(SO), 1001, 955."
7,Catalytic assays via MW irradiation,"2.6 Catalytic assays via MW irradiation Experiments with 2.5 mmol of substrates and 2.5–7.5 mmol of oxidant were conducted using a focused Anton Paar Monowave 300 microwave reactor in 10 mL glass vessels with 10 mm internal diameter, sealed with rubber membranes in a stirred mode with simultaneous cooling (IR temperature detector). The targeted temperature together with a maximum microwave power (50 or 100 W) was set. The targeted temperature was reached within a few minutes. During the course of the reaction, the microwave power (15–50 W) as well as the pressure (1–10 bar) varied. At the end of the reaction, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature and the vessel cap was carefully opened to slowly release the pressure."
8,Gas-chromatography analysis,"2.7 Gas-chromatography analysis Succeeding the MW-assisted reaction, 7 mL of acetonitrile together with acetophenone (1.25–2.50 mmol; internal standard) were added to the reaction mixture. A final solution aliquot (1 mL) was removed and centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by GC for quantification of oxidation products."
9,X-ray measurements,"2.8 X-ray measurements X-ray quality single crystals of complex 6 were immersed in cryo-oil, mounted in Nylon loops and measured at a temperature of 296–297 K. Intensity data were collected using a Bruker AXS-KAPPA APEX II PHOTON 100 diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073) radiation. Data were collected using omega scans of 0.5° per frame and full sphere of data were obtained. Cell parameters were retrieved using Bruker SMART [21] software and refined using Bruker SAINT [22] on all the observed reflections. Absorption corrections were applied using SADABS [23]. Structures were solved by direct methods by using SIR-97 [24] and refined with SHELXL–2014 [25]. Calculations were performed using the WinGX-Version 2014.01 [26]. The hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms were inserted at geometrically calculated positions and included in the refinement using the riding-model approximation; Uiso(H) were defined as 1.2 Ueq of the parent carbon atoms for phenyl residues and 1.5 Ueq of the parent carbon atoms for the methyl groups. The hydrogen atoms of water molecules were located from the final difference Fourier map and the isotropic thermal parameters were set at 1.5 times the average thermal parameters of the belonging oxygen atoms. Least square refinements with anisotropic thermal motion parameters for all the non-hydrogen atoms and isotropic for the remaining atoms were employed."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Synthesis of the 2-methyltetrazole-saccharinate (5) and Zn(II) complex (6),"3.1 Synthesis of the 2-methyltetrazole-saccharinate (5) and Zn(II) complex (6) The production of tetrazole-saccharinate bidentate N,N-chelating ligands was initiated by some of us, about a decade ago [27]. The synthetic approach used for the preparation of this kind of scaffolds, and applied for the particular case of compound 5, consists in a convergent strategy involving a first derivatization of the heterocyclic cores (tetrazole and benzisothiazole) independently, followed by the coupling of the two entities (see Fig. 1 ). Synthetic details on the preparation of 5 should be consulted in the Experimental section. Contrary to the ligand 5, the Zn(II) complex (6, Fig. 1) is absolutely new and reported here for the first time. The synthesis of the Zn(II) metal complex comprising ligand 5 proceeded at ambient conditions by reaction of 5 with ZnSO4·H2O salt. Metal complex 6 was isolated as a mononuclear compound where the 2-methyltetrazole-saccharinate 5 acts as monoanionic bidentate N,N-chelating ligand (Fig. 1) and crystalizes with one water molecule as solvent of crystallization. The central zinc atom of 6 is hexacoordinated with a distorted octahedral N4O2 coordination. There are two monoanionic bidentate N,N-ligands, one water and one DMSO molecules coordinated to Zn(II) ion. Detailed structural data for complex 6 can be accessed in Tables S1–S3 in Supporting Information."
12,Application of Zn(II) complex (6) as catalyst for benzylic alcohols oxidation,"3.2 Application of Zn(II) complex (6) as catalyst for benzylic alcohols oxidation Having the complex 6 in hand, a careful optimization of the reaction conditions using a microwave reactor was initialized. Electing the benzyl alcohol (7a) as model substrate, a screening covering a number of variations on reaction times and temperatures, MW-power, catalyst loading and the presence of additives, was completed (see Table 1 ). To our delight, in first instance, it was observed that, for the alcohol 7a, the use of a very low amount of Zn(II) catalyst (0.1 mol%) at relatively low temperature (70 °C, aprx. 15–25 W MW power) and in a short reaction period (10 min), had led to the selective formation of benzaldehyde (8a) in nearly quantitative yield. The use of TBHP (70% in H2O) as oxidant (2.0 eq.), revealed to be the best choice along the tested possibilities (see Table 1). It should be noted that, per se, the salt ZnSO4·H2O used in the production of complex 6, had shown important catalytic activity in the oxidation of the alcohol 7a; patently lower than the catalytic activity of complex 6 under similar conditions, but nonetheless noteworthy (Table 1, entries 1 and 23). Subsequently to the optimization of reaction conditions comprising the alcohol 7a, the scope for the oxidation was evaluated using a series of benzyl alcohol derivatives (7b-i, Table 2 ). Characteristic substrates bearing different substituent groups at the benzene ring were submitted to similar reaction environments based on the earlier results for 7a, to produce the corresponding aldehydes in excellent yields (Table 2). Ordinarily, for all the tested substrates, the oxidation occurs in very short periods of time (5–20 min) at temperatures not exceeding 100 °C (usually 70 °C) featuring high turnover frequencies (TOFs) up to 1.1 × 104 h−1. Further, the introduction of the nitroxyl radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl-1-oxyl (TEMPO) in the system with the alcohol 7a leads to an obvious decrease of reaction yield (Table 2, entries 1 and 5). As indicated by us in preceding investigations [19a], and assuming a presumable similar effect herein, TEMPO could act as a radical trap reacting with free radical species generated form TBHP (tert-butoxyl and hydroxyl radicals) to form other peroxides. Besides, the addition of the carbon-radical trap CBrCl3 to the system created a strong inhibitory effect on the reactivity, reflected in a very low yield (22%) achieved (Table 2, entry 6). Given these circumstances, the tests carried out with TEMPO and CBrCl3 indicate that the oxidation of benzyl alcohols using TBHP and catalysed by the zinc complex 6 might proceed via a radical mechanism involving oxygen- and carbon-centered radicals."
13,Reaction mechanism survey,"3.3 Reaction mechanism survey The improvement in the catalytic activity when the zinc coordinates with two ligands 5, forming the complex 6, is evident, comparatively to the observed activity when the metal is used in the salt formulation ZnSO4·H2O. The role of the ligands 5 on the promotion of benzyl alcohol oxidation process seems to be irrefutable. What remains to be clarified is if such ligands act independently to the metallic center during the catalytic cycle, or if they are acting simply through an electronic stabilization of the zinc, or if a cooperative metal-ligand mechanism is at place. We know that ligand 5, by itself, works as a promoter/organocatalyst in the oxidation of a series of benzyl alcohol derivatives, although showing modest results in terms of reaction yields when compared with catalyst 6 [19e]. In the course of this investigation, the detection of free ligand 5, i.e., non-coordinated to zinc, after work-up, was never feasibly in any circumstance, largely due to the small amount of catalyst used in each reaction. Nevertheless, although this possibility cannot be ruled out, its effect is not a determinant one, since the catalytic activity of complex 6 is markedly higher than that of the free ligand.[19e]. In this context, an initial displacement of the labile water molecule from the complex 6 (1st step) should conduct to the coordination of benzyl alcohol to zinc (2nd step), forming the new complex 6’. In a parallel process, the TBHP present in the reaction medium will decompose to form tert-butoxyl and hydroxyl radicals, [28a,b] via homolytic cleavage of O–O bond promoted by microwave radiation.[28b,c] It is assumed that TBHP-based radicals’ formation should occur without intervention of the Zn(II) complex (6). The 3rd step of the catalytic cycle will comprise the liberation of the hydroxyl proton from the alcohol and its transfer to a basic nitrogen atom of one of the ligands 5 (see Fig. 2 , structure 6″), followed by the abstraction of a C–H hydrogen atom by tert-butoxyl radical releasing tert-butanol and generating the transition state structure TS1 (step 4). In the final steps, the reaction of TS1 with a hydroxyl radical liberates water and the corresponding aldehyde, leading to the regeneration of the catalyst 6, enabling turnover. The tetrazole-saccharinate ligand, in view of its basicity, conceivably promotes proton-shift steps, namely accepting the acidic proton from the coordinated alcohol (step 3) and releasing it (step 5) for the formation of water and aldehyde with regeneration of 6. Hence, a metal-ligand cooperation effect is proposed to occur in this system. Additional investigations on other zinc catalysts, as well as extensive mechanistic studies (involving DFT calculations) on the oxidation of benzyl alcohols mediated by the present zinc complex, are ongoing in our laboratories and will be reported in due course. It is estimated that some of this research may clarify the potential metal-ligand cooperation during the catalytic cycle."
14,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have shown herein a facile and selective transformation of a series of benzyl alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes promoted by a novel tetrazole-saccharinate Zn(II) catalyst. The reaction, activated by microwave radiation, proceeds typically in a few minutes under effective smooth conditions by using TBHP (70%. aq.) as oxidizing agent, in absence of any organic solvent and conveys some functional group tolerance. Current experiments allude to a radical reaction mechanism comprising oxygen- and carbon-centered radicals. The use of zinc catalysts, particularly on oxidation reactions comprising different functional groups present in relevant small organic molecules, although less frequent when compared to copper or iron catalysts is growing significantly with good results. Evidence of this is the research work offered here!"
