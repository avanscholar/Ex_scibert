0,Introduction,"One of the key processing operations in the production of advanced biofuels and biochemicals is hydrotreatment (hydrodeoxygenation, hydroisomerization). Correspondingly, the stabilization and refining of bio-oils originating from biomass pyrolysis and liquefaction lead typically to different hydrotreatments. Currently hydrogen required for these and many other applications is predominantly obtained through steam reforming of natural gas, which contradicts the renewability and sustainability of these bio-product. On the other hand, increasing amounts of side/waste-streams containing rather low concentrations of bio-based compounds such as carbohydrates, alcohols and sugar alcohols are available with the various existing and emerging bio-refinery concepts. Renewable hydrogen can be produced through aqueous phase reforming (APR) of these renewable feedstock [1,2] and be used instead of the fossil based hydrogen for chemical valorization or for bioenergy production. The use of APR has obtained increasing interest for treating industrial side/waste-streams. Some studies have recently been reported where e.g. waste streams from brewery wastewaters and fish-canning industry effluents have been treated with APR [3–5], however, the examples are not yet plenty. A special feature of APR is that both the reactants and the solvent (water) are kept in the liquid phase by applying elevated pressures. Advantages of APR compared to the obvious alternative technology i.e. gasification are a significantly lower reaction temperature (~225 °C vs ~750 °C) and no need for reactant evaporation reducing the energy demand for hydrogen production [6]. Moreover, APR is well suited for processing dilute aqueous streams containing e.g. a few per cent of the reactants, whereas high amounts of water with a low solid content pose a significant challenge for gasification. It has, however, been reported that direct APR of sugars can have a negative effect on the hydrogen selectivity through various liquid phase reactions [6]. A probable reason for a lower hydrogen selectivity in the case of using sugars as the feed is the presence of carbonyl groups. Most of the current APR research has been carried out with reactants not containing carbonyl groups such as methanol [1,7], ethanol [8] ethylene glycol [1,9–11], 1-propanol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol [1,13,14], as well as sugar alcohols namely, sorbitol, galactitol and xylitol [1,10,15–18]. The typical concentration ranges used in these works has been between 3.6 wt.-% and 10 wt.-%, which corresponds with typical streams encountered in industry, with side streams being often from the more diluted end. Xylitol was used in the current study as a representative sugar alcohol due to the vast and versatile processing of xylose containing feedstock in the bio based industry. Moreover, pentose based compounds are often abundant in industrial side streams due to the focus on hexose based products. It has been reported that platinum catalysts are suitable in APR of sugar alcohols to hydrogen [18,19]. Moreover, the catalyst was a commercial one ensuring the availability of it to all interested parties. During aqueous phase reforming of polyols, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are formed, with the first step being dehydrogenation of the polyol to the corresponding sugar [20]. The carbon monoxide reacts further with water forming hydrogen and carbon dioxide through the water gas shift reaction. APR of xylitol, gives 11 mol of hydrogen and 5 mol of carbon dioxide according to the reaction scheme displayed in Fig. 1 . The reforming ratio (RR) of xylitol is 11/5 based on the number of moles of hydrogen and carbon dioxide formed. Side reactions can also occur during APR of sugar alcohols forming different alkanes and liquid phase oxygenates [21] resulting in a lower hydrogen selectivity. The active metal can also affect selectivity to hydrogen. Godina et al. [18] utilized mono- and bimetallic catalysts in APR of xylitol using platinum, nickel, rhenium and ruthenium as monometallic catalysts and combination of them with platinum as the bimetallic catalysts. Pt–Re supported on mesoporous carbon Sibunit displayed a significantly higher activity compared to other tested catalysts, furthermore, selectivity to alkanes (mainly butane and pentane) was close to 30% with a clearly lower hydrogen selectivity. In addition to the nature of the active metal, reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure and residence time, can also have an influence both on conversion and selectivity to the desired product. Typically, reports in the open literature describe the reactant conversion and selectivity at a few values of temperatures and pressures [7,18,20,21]. Different conversion levels are usually obtained by changing the liquid flow with the main focus being on catalyst screening. Only a few reports [22] exist where the influence of operating variables is investigated. García et al. [22] studied the effect of reaction temperature (495–510 K), pressure (28–40 bar), reactant concentration (2–10 wt%), liquid flow rate (0.5–3.0 ml/min), and the catalyst to reactant ratio (10–40 g cat min/g reactant) in aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol over a Ni/Al coprecipitated catalyst. The authors [22] reported that conversion of glycerol is enhanced at higher pressures, temperatures, glycerol concentrations and catalyst to glycerol ratios. Interestingly, the variation of liquid flow rates from 0.5 to 3.0 ml/min with 0.5 ml/min increments did not change conversion, being on average 53% at 500 K, 34 bar, initial concentration of 5 wt% glycerol in water and a catalyst loading of 20 g cat min/g glycerol. No similar reports are available in the open literature where systematic variations in the reaction conditions, namely reaction temperature, pressure, flow of inert gas and liquid, have been investigated in aqueous-phase reforming of xylitol. This work was, therefore, focused on elucidation of the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure and inert gas flow) on the xylitol conversion and hydrogen selectivity."
1,Experimental,
2,Reactor set-up,"2.1 Reactor set-up The reactor set-up used in the aqueous phase reforming of xylitol consists of a 50 cm long 4,2 mm inner diameter stainless steel tube reactor. The reactor was filled with acid washed glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and the catalyst. The flow of the inert He/N2 gas was controlled with a Brooks (5850S) mass flow controller. The xylitol solution was pumped to the reactor with an Eldex HPLC pump, the xylitol solution bottle was placed on a scale to monitor the flow. The reactor was operated in the trickle-flow mode, as it has been shown in previous works that an inert gas phase could be beneficial for increasing conversion [14,15,17,18,20,21]. The reactor was heated with an electrical oven (ATS, 3210). The pressure of the set-up was controlled with an Equilibar gas/liquid back pressure regulator. The gas/liquid flow out from the pressure controller was separated in a 25 ml 3-neck flask. The 3-neck bottle was utilized in such a way that one neck acted as the inlet, another one was needed for the gas flow out and the third one was used for periodical liquid sampling. The gas flow from the gas/liquid separator was passed through a condenser operated at −5 °C (LAUDA, RE106) to dry the gases prior to gas analysis with an Agilent 3000A Micro GC. The xylitol conversion was determined by the liquid sample analysis with a HPLC (Hewlett Packard, Series 1100) equipped with a Biorad column (Aminex HPX-87H) and using 0.005 M sulfuric acid as the eluent (0.6 ml/min, 45 °C). A hydrogen line was also connected to the reactor set-up for catalyst reduction, the flow of hydrogen was controlled with a Brooks mass flow controller (5850S). A schematic view of the reactor set-up is illustrated in Fig. 2 ."
3,Materials,"A 5 wt-% aqueous solution of xylitol (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared and used as the feed in the experiments. A commercial catalyst 1 wt-% Pt/Al2O3 as pellets (Sigma-Aldrich) was used. The pellets were about 3 mm in diameter and height and the Pt was distributed as an egg-shell on the outer layer of the pellets. Prior to loading the reactor tube, the catalyst pellets were crushed and sieved to a 355–500 μm fraction and dried. Response factors for the gaseous products were determined by analysis of the calibration gas mixtures. The products quantified with the micro GC were H2, CO2, CO, He and short alkanes CH4, C2H6, C3H8, i-C4H10, n-C4H10, neo-C5H12, i-C5H12, n-C5H12, i-C6H14, n-C6H14, cyclohexane and n-C7H16. Helium in the inert gas mixture was used as an internal standard to calculate the molar flows of different gases formed during aqueous phase reforming of xylitol."
4,Calculations,"3.1 Calculations Xylitol conversion was calculated based on the peak areas obtained through HPLC analysis of the liquid samples. Selectivity to carbon dioxide was calculated by dividing the molar flow of carbon dioxide with the total molar flow of carbon in the gas phase, equation (1). Likewise, the selectivity to hydrogen was calculated by dividing the molar flow of hydrogen with the total molar flow of carbon in the gas phase given in equation (2) and taking into account the reforming ratio (RR) for xylitol which is 11/5 as in Fig. 1. Selectivity to alkanes was calculated with equation (3) by dividing the molar flow of carbon for the alkane in question with the total molar flow of carbon in the gas phase. (1) S C O 2 = n ˙ C O 2 n ˙ c a r b o n (2) S H 2 = n ˙ H 2 n ˙ c a r b o n ⋅ 1 R R (3) S A = n ˙ C , A n ˙ c a r b o n"
5,Experimental procedure,"3.2 Experimental procedure The reactor was filled with the catalyst, pressurized to 30 bar using the gas mixture containing He and N2 gas and checked for possible leakages with a leak detection spray. After the pressure test the reactor was purged to remove oxygen from it, thereafter the gas flow was changed to hydrogen and a temperature program (5 °C/min to 250 °C, isothermal for 2 h) was started. Influence of the reaction conditions on conversion and selectivity was investigated by varying the temperature (170, 215, 225 and 235 °C), pressure (14, 22, 30 and 36.5 bar), gas flow through the reactor (0, 17 and 34 ml/min STP) as well as the liquid flow (0.05, 0.10 and 0.20 ml/min) corresponding to superficial residence times in the catalyst bed for the gas and liquid between 0-1.4 min and 4.4–17.5 min, respectively. The temperature range was chosen based on literature findings [18,21] and preliminary experiments performed and the pressures corresponding to the vapor pressure in order to keep the liquid phase liquid, while the flow rates were chosen based on reactor dimensions in order to achieve suitable residence times. The amount of the catalyst was kept constant at 0.5 g (1.5 g at 170 °C) and the concentration of xylitol was 5 wt% in all experiments."
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.3 Catalyst characterization CO pulse chemisorption and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out with a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 instrument to determine the platinum dispersion and reduction temperature. The TPR profile displayed in Fig. 3 shows a small peak at approximately 200 °C, which is attributed to the reduction of Pt particles. A larger peak at 400 °C can be due to reduction of Pt agglomerates as reported by Bueno et al. [23]. Before the CO pulse chemisorption the catalyst was reduced in a flow of hydrogen at 250 °C for 2 h, following the procedure reported by Tokarev et al. [24]. The platinum dispersion was determined to be 48% by assuming the CO:metal ratio of 1:1."
7,Results,
8,Effect of reaction temperature,"4.1 Effect of reaction temperature The influence of temperature was studied in a fairly narrow interval, 215–235 °C with 0.5 g of fresh Pt/Al2O3 (355–500 μm) catalyst. The results displayed in Fig. 4 clearly show that more xylitol is converted at higher temperatures. Selectivity to hydrogen, CO2 and alkanes did not significantly change at different reaction temperatures and as a function of time-on-stream. The flow of xylitol was kept constant (0.2 ml/min) and the pressure at 30 bar during the experiment at 215 and 225 °C and increased to 36.5 bar at 235 °C to keep most of water in the liquid form. Time-on-stream and temperature dependence shown in Fig. 4 indicate that while catalyst deactivation is not significant for the first 50 h at lower temperatures (215 and 225 °C), some deactivation in terms of xylitol conversion decrease can be observed at the highest 235 °C temperature. The main reason for the deactivation at the highest temperature is most probably blockage of the active sites by deposits resulting from condensation products. Moreover, some sintering of the Pt on the alumina could have occurred due to higher temperature. Both of these causes of deactivation result in the decrease in the available surface area of Pt for reaction decreasing conversion, however, it was not observed to influence the selectivity. This indicates that the reaction pathways following the adsorption of xylitol on the catalyst surface were not influenced by the diminished surface area, only the kinetics were slower. Carbon distribution as a function of xylitol conversion plotted in Fig. 5 displays a split between carbon content in the liquid and gas phases. Carbon in the liquid phase was calculated by subtracting from the initial amount of carbon xylitol left in the liquid phase and carbon in the gas phase. Small peaks of xylose, ethylene glycol, glycerol and propanediols were detected with HPLC besides the main peak of xylitol. A substantial amount of carbon is present in the liquid phase as other compounds, as seen in Fig. 5. Analysis of the liquid phase is, however, not straightforward because HPLC might not able to elute/detect all products while GC analysis of the liquid phase requires drying and silylation or other derivatization prior to GC in order to make the compounds more volatile and thermally stable. Most likely several compounds are lost from the sample during drying. Formation of xylose, detected with HPLC, can confirm that the first reaction step in APR is dehydrogenation of the sugar alcohol to the corresponding sugar [20], being in this case dehydrogenation of xylitol to xylose. The activation energy for xylitol reforming was calculated to be 79.3 kJ/mol from the average xylitol conversions at different reaction temperatures. The logarithm of the conversions was plotted against the reciprocal temperatures (in Kelvin) and the slope of these points were multiplied with the gas constant, resulting in the activation energy for xylitol reforming. The R2-value for the slope was 0.9792 and that would suggest an uncertainty of approximately 2%. Comparison with the literature is not possible since the activation energy for xylitol conversion during APR is reported here for the first time. However, the activation energy has been reported for aqueous-phase hydrogenolysis and reforming of glycerol to be 61.1 kJ/mol over a Pt/Fe3O4 catalyst [25]. Selectivity to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and alkanes as a function of xylitol conversion is plotted in Fig. 6 showing that the selectivity is more or less independent of xylitol conversion at the conditions studied in this work. In other words, temperature (215–235 °C) does not significantly affect selectivity to different products formed during APR, even though hydrogen selectivity was slightly higher at lower temperature. Interestingly, Godina et al. [17] using similar Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for APR of polyols with a longer carbon chain, namely sorbitol and galactitol, reported that selectivity to hydrogen clearly decreased from 140% at 20% conversion to 60% when APR was carried out at full conversion. Selectivity to carbon dioxide was not affected to the same degree as to hydrogen at different conversion levels, being ca. 90% [17]. Selectivity to alkanes according to the chain length is specified in Fig. 7 . As can be seen from this figure mainly ethane and propane are formed with smaller amounts of methane and longer alkanes. It can be concluded, that although temperature affected the xylitol conversion it did not influence the distribution of alkanes to a large extent. Godina et al. [18] studied previously APR of xylitol over platinum supported on mesoporous carbon at a constant reaction condition, 225 °C, 29.7 bar by varying the liquid flow. The authors reported a clear maximum for propane which is slightly different from the results presented in Fig. 7 where both ethane and propane are formed in almost similar amounts. Based on the results presented above it can be concluded that, as expected, temperature affects the conversion of xylitol having only minor effects on selectivity to hydrogen and other gaseous products. These observations can be explained by considering dehydrogenation of xylitol as the rate limiting step. Subsequent transformations of the intermediates occur rapidly independent on temperature as seen by similar selectivity to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and distribution of alkanes."
9,Effect of reaction pressure,"4.2 Effect of reaction pressure The effect of pressure was studied by performing experiments at 25, 30 and 35 bar at a constant temperature (215 °C) utilizing fresh, i.e. not used in the results obtained at different reaction temperatures presented above, Pt/Al2O3 catalysts (0.5 g, 355–500 μm size fraction). Xylitol conversion and selectivity to hydrogen, CO2 and alkanes are presented in Fig. 8 . Selectivity to hydrogen appears to be unaffected by the reaction pressure, while a slightly lower selectivity to carbon dioxide and a higher selectivity to alkanes can be observed at the lowest reaction pressure of 25 bar. Xylitol conversion follows a clear trend and a higher conversion is observed at lower pressures. Higher overall pressures increases the hydrogen pressure in the reactor and this will suppress the first reaction step in APR, namely dehydrogenation of xylitol to xylose. This is most likely the reason for higher xylitol conversion levels at lower reaction pressures. The hypothesis is also supported by the observations made in experiments performed at constant pressure with different flow rates of inert gas (e.g. Fig. 13), where the conversion was very low with 0 ml/min and it increased with increasing gas flow. These results show that stripping hydrogen from the liquid phase promotes xylitol conversion, while increasing hydrogen concentration in the liquid phase by increasing pressure has the opposite effect. Moreover, the dependence of conversion on pressure is very linear as presented in Fig. 10, which would comply with a linear dependence of hydrogen concentration with pressure according to Henry's law. The results presented here are in contradiction with the data reported by García et al. [22] on glycerol APR, when the conversion increased when the reaction pressure was higher. The carbon distribution, not shown here, follows a similar trend as in the case of different reaction temperatures. A higher ratio of the liquid phase carbon is present when the xylitol conversion is higher. Alkane distribution according to their chain length is presented in Fig. 9 . An interesting observation can be made from this figure, namely that selectivity starts to show some bimodality, exhibiting higher values for C3 and C6 alkanes, when the pressure is decreased. At higher pressures the selectivity is shifted more towards shorter C1-3 alkanes. Formation of hexane is also interesting from a mechanistic viewpoint since the reactant is xylitol with a five carbon chain. A probable explanation might be aldol condensation as suggested previously [18,26,27]. Compared to the alkane distribution shown in Fig. 7 one can clearly notice that smaller amounts of ethane and higher of hexane are formed when the pressure is lower. However, at similar reaction conditions tested in Figs. 7 and 9, namely 215 °C and 30 bar, the distribution of alkanes is not exactly the same. A reason for the differences might be catalyst ageing, as Fig. 7 reports the results from the beginning of the run while Fig. 9 contains data at the end of an experiment. Nonetheless, the distribution of alkanes in Fig. 7 follows the same trend. The results displayed in Fig. 10 show a clear trend for the xylitol conversion, meaning that a higher reaction pressure diminishes xylitol conversion. The pressure has no effect on the selectivity to hydrogen and CO2 being respectively ca. 80 and 95%. The influence of gas flow was studied at 225 °C and 30 bar with different flows, 17 and 34 ml/min (STP) as well as without any gas flow through the reactor. Results from the run with different gas flows are shown in Fig. 11 . The experimental procedure was modified when there was no gas flow through the reactor. In order to be able to use helium as an internal standard a 34 ml/min flow was fed directly to the gas-liquid separator. The gas was routed to the reactor at 280 min. Xylitol conversion was low when the reaction was carried out in absence of the inert gas flow through the reactor. Selectivity to hydrogen displayed a scattered behaviour. As can be seen from Fig. 11, an improvement of the xylitol conversion and stabilization of selectivity to hydrogen was achieved when the reactor was flushed with the inert gas. The results presented above are in agreement with data reported earlier, although, for sorbitol APR [12]. Nijhuis et al. [12] applying two different reactor configurations, namely a micro-channel reactor and a fixed bed reactor, found that sorbitol conversion was enhanced when both reactors were operated with an inert gas flow through them. Influence of the gas flow on selectivity to alkanes is shown in Fig. 12 . In the absence of any inert gas the selectivity to shorter alkanes (e.g. methane) is strongly favored, while the gas flow of 17 and 34 ml/min through the reactor resulted in a fairly similar selectivity distribution except for formation of butanes which is lower at a lower flow. Nijhuis et al. [12] reported minor amounts of C1–C3 alkanes in the gas phase, which corresponds fairly well with our results obtained for a sugar alcohol with one carbon less in the chain. It has been speculated that hydrogenolysis might occur during APR of polyols cleaving the carbon chain at various places, mainly to C3 products [12]. This is a probable reason for a fairly high selectivity towards shorter alkanes. The data reported by Nijhuis et al. [12] were obtained at 25% sorbitol conversion with an external gas flow through the different reactor configurations. Our results are generated at two similar xylitol conversion (approximately 30%) levels and one lower level. The latter case corresponding to absence of a gas flow through the reactor, generates more methane than when an inert gas is passed through the reactor. This observation is in line with the results presented in Fig. 9, where higher pressure and hydrogen concentration promoted methane production. A mechanistic explanation for a higher degree of methane production could be methanation, which is enhanced by a higher concentration of hydrogen in the reactor compared to the case when the inert gas flow is used flushing away the gases formed during APR. However, methanation typically requires higher temperatures and hydrogen concentrations [28]. Xylitol conversion and selectivities to hydrogen and carbon dioxide as a function of the gas flow through the reactor are shown in Fig. 13 illustrating that a gas flow through the reactor is crucial for obtaining good hydrogen selectivity. From the results presented above it can be concluded that by having a flow of gas through the reactor, hydrogen and other gases can be flushed away from the reaction zone, thereby preventing reversible reactions (hydrogenation) as well as hydrogenolysis and methanation. Effect of low temperature APR at different flow and pressure conditions. All experiments reported above were carried out at a relatively high temperature of 215–235 °C. Considering changing the xylitol feed stock to the corresponding xylose sugar it would be interesting to explore APR at a lower temperature. It is well known that caramelization/degradation of sugars to humins can occur at elevated temperatures [29]. A fairly safe temperature to avoid unwanted sugar transformation is 170 °C at reasonable residence times [30]. The influence of reaction pressure, gas and liquid flows on the xylitol conversion, selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide as well as on hydrogen productivity was investigated at the lower temperature. To compensate for lower rates at lower temperatures a higher catalyst amount (1.5 g) was used. Time on stream behaviour for the APR of xylitol carried out at 170 °C at different pressures, gas and liquid flows is shown in Fig. 14 while the experimental program, describing different pressures (bar), gas (ml/min) and liquid (cg/min) flow tested at 170 °C is illustrated in Fig. 15 . Selectivity to CO2 is quite constant, while the selectivity to hydrogen shows more variations than for the higher temperature. A reason for this scattering could be due to the fact that the peak areas obtained with the micro-GC are significantly smaller than at higher temperatures. No gas or liquid samples were taken between 3300 and 7340 min and the reactor was flushed with water during this period. The results from APR at 170 °C illustrated in Fig. 15 show trends similar to the results obtained at higher temperatures. Lower reaction pressure and higher gas flow improve xylitol conversion. Slightly better selectivity to hydrogen was observed at lower reaction pressures. Influence of the liquid flow at the lowest pressure (14 bar) and the highest gas flow (33.9 ml/min STP) on conversion and selectivity is illustrated in Fig. 16 . A clear xylitol conversion trend can be seen in Fig. 16. More xylitol reacts at lower liquid flow, as expected since the liquid residence time in the reactor is increased. Fig. 16 shows that the selectivity to hydrogen and CO2 is slightly better when a higher liquid flow is used. The selectivity to carbon dioxide is between 96.1 and 98.1% giving a very low selectivity to alkanes (1.9–3.9%) (Table 1 ). The selectivity to different alkanes is shown in Fig. 17 . Based on the results presented above one can draw a conclusion that xylitol is converted faster at low pressures and high inert gas flow. Furthermore, the selectivity to hydrogen can be increased from less than 80% to over 90% with a simultaneous decrease of alkane selectivity under suitable reaction conditions. The highest hydrogen selectivity was achieved at the lowest (14 bar) pressure and lowest inert gas flow (11.3 ml/min) at 170 °C, although the selectivity to hydrogen was among the highest ones also with higher gas flow through the reactor (22.6 and 33.9 ml/min) at the same temperature. This is consistent with the results displayed in Fig. 6., i.e. lower temperature resulted in slightly higher hydrogen selectivity. A low liquid flow, i.e. a longer residence time, had a negative effect on the hydrogen selectivity giving higher alkane selectivity instead. Considering that three times more catalyst was used at 170 °C compared to experiments performed at the higher temperatures in combination with the lower pressures, the achieved conversions can be considered very low."
10,Conclusions,"The scope of the current work was to investigate the production of hydrogen, and alkanes as a byproduct, from sugar alcohols with aqueous phase reforming for use in biofuels, bio-chemicals and bioenergy production. Xylitol was selected as the substrate as it is a representative pentose based sugar alcohol. APR of xylitol was studied in a trickle-bed reactor over a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, gas and liquid flows, had an influence on the xylitol conversion and in some cases also on the hydrogen selectivity. Pressure had a negative effect on conversion while better results were achieved with a higher inert gas flow and temperature. Low selectivity to hydrogen was observed when no carrier gas was used in the reactor. The influence of other reaction conditions did not change the hydrogen selectivity to a large extent, being ca. 80% for all conditions tested. APR carried out at a significantly lower temperature (170 °C) than what has been previously used in the literature gave a relatively high selectivity, 90.3%, to hydrogen. The results clearly demonstrate that APR is a feasible technology for energy efficient value added processing and purification of dilute aqueous side streams in existing and future bio-refineries. The overall efficiency and economic viability is strengthened by the fact that side streams, which can have even a negative value as they must be treated anyhow, are used. Moreover, the side streams are typically already heated to elevated temperatures, which helps in the energy efficiency and heat integration in the process. However, detailed evaluation should naturally be performed depending on the specific case in question."
