0,Introduction,"It is now commonly agreed by most scientists that excessive anthropogenic CO2 emission is a main contributor to global warming and the associated climate change phenomenon. The intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) predicts a global temperature rise of up to 4.8°C over the next century. The expected consequences of climate change are for the most part negative with significant environmental, societal and economical costs [1]. However, despite the dire situation and the ominous predictions, about 80% of our energy consumption still originates from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas and petroleum oil), resulting in the emission of more than 35 billion metric tonnes of CO2 into the environment in 2015 alone. As the world’s human population is predicted to grow from 7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100, along with increasing standard of living, a steadily increasing global energy demand seems inevitable. In this context, utilization of cleaner renewable energy sources and limiting CO2 emission into the atmosphere are paramount in order to avoid the adverse consequences of excessive anthropogenic carbon emissions. One way to avoid increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is by capturing CO2 from emission point sources as well as from dilute sources like ambient air [2,3]. The captured CO2 can then be pressurized and stored underground in geological formations, in a process called carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) [4,5]. An alternate and attractive pathway is carbon capture and recycling (CCR), where the concentrated CO2 obtained after capture is used to make new materials and fuels. For instance, fuels such as methanol, dimethylether and formic acid can be obtained by hydrogenation of CO2 captured from the atmosphere [6–9]. Upon utilization of these fuels, CO2 would be released back to the atmosphere, from where it can again be captured and converted to fuels, leading to a carbon neutral cycle (Fig. 1 ). Producing methanol through CCR is an essential part of the proposed “Methanol Economy” concept championed by late professor and Nobel Laureate George A. Olah [9,10]. Methanol can be directly used as a fuel in internal combustion engines (ICE), gas turbines and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), as a feedstock for numerous chemicals, and as a precursor for the production of higher hydrocarbons [9]. Another way to harness the energy stored in methanol is through methanol reforming, where H2 and CO2 are produced from a methanol/water mixture. Hydrogen is a clean fuel since its only combustion product is water. Hydrogen has also a high gravimetric energy density. However, due to its gaseous nature and thus low volumetric density, storage and handling of pure hydrogen remains a challenge [11,12]. In practice, the use of a LOHC (liquid organic hydrogen carrier) would be preferable, as these LOHC are much more user friendly, safer and easier to use compared to pure hydrogen [13]. Methanol is a convenient LOHC since it can be produced through CO2 hydrogenation, and the stored H2 can be conveniently extracted through aqueous reforming (Scheme 1 ). The produced H2 can then be fed to a hydrogen fuel cell for electrical power generation. This two-step process, methanol reforming and subsequent use of generated H2 in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, has been named a “reformed methanol fuel cell (RMFC)” and constitutes essentially an indirect methanol combustion route as shown in Scheme 2 . Ideally, for a “methanol economy” to be sustainable, the hydrogen must be obtained by water electrolysis or any other water splitting method using renewable or nuclear energy to achieve an overall carbon neutral cycle [14–18]. As such, methanol acts not only as an energy carrier, but also an energy storage medium for intermittent and fluctuating renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. Heterogeneous Cu-based catalysts are known for both CO2 hydrogenation to methanol/water and the reverse reaction, methanol reforming, but require high temperature (>200°C) and/or high pressure (>50bar) for both forward and reverse reactions [19–23]. In contrast, homogenous catalytic systems can operate at temperatures below 150°C [24]. Since the hydrogenation reaction is entropically unfavorable, performing it at lower temperature would improve the overall theoretical yield. In addition, the homogeneous catalyst can be rationally designed by studying the mechanism on a molecular level and thus the overall catalytic activity can be improved. An ideal industrial or practical catalyst for the synthesis of CH3OH (derived from CO2) and the reverse reaction is expected among others to have the following properties/benefits: (i) be preferably non-noble metal-based, (ii) operate at low temperatures and low pressures, (iii) have high TON/TOFs, and (iv) have a long lifetime. This would reduce the operational cost and energy input to the system. Henceforth, the recent advances in the synthesis of methanol from CO2 at low temperature with homogenous catalysis will be discussed."
1,Catalytic homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol,"Back in 1995, the first homogenous metal catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol was performed by Tominaga et al. using molecular hydrogen, Ru3(CO)12 and potassium iodide in a N-methylpyrrolidone solution at 240°C under 80bar of a 3H2:CO2 mixture (Scheme 3 ) [25]. In the absence of potassium iodide, Ru3(CO)12 decomposed to ruthenium metal causing methanation of CO2. However, in the presence of a halide, CO2 was first converted to CO (through the reverse water-gas shift reaction) at about 200°C and then subsequent hydrogenation of CO formed methanol at about 240°C. Below 160°C, no trace of CO or CH3OH was observed and above 240°C, the formed methanol further hydrogenated to methane. Other transition metal complexes such as Rh3(CO)12, Ir4(CO)12, W(CO)6, Mo(CO)6, Fe2(CO)9 and Co2(CO)8 gave no CO2 hydrogenation products. From the mechanistic study, it was identified that the tetranuclear ruthenium cluster formed during the reaction first converts CO2 to CO. Under the CO atmosphere, the tetranuclear ruthenium cluster is converted to [HRu3(CO)11]− and [Ru(CO)3I3]− complexes, which catalyze the CO hydrogenation to methanol. However, this system suffers from significant drawbacks in terms of selectivity and the need for high operating temperature. For more than a decade after this study, no other homogenous catalytic system for the conversion of CO2 to methanol was reported. In 2011, the Milstein group described the successful hydrogenation of carbonates, carbamates and formate esters to methanol in the presence of Ru-PNN pincer catalysts [26]. While direct CO2 hydrogenation wasn’t achieved, this process, however, enabled an indirect approach for CO2 to methanol reduction, since carbonates, carbamates, and formates can be easily synthesized from CO2 and alcohols or amines. (Scheme 4 ). It should be noted that such a two-step sequential process, from CO2 to carbonate, carbamate and formate and then to MeOH, would be mechanistically very different than the system developed by Tominaga, which proceeds through reduction of in situ formed CO. The ability of complexes C-1 and C-2 to catalyze the hydrogenation reaction with molecular H2 stems from their capacity to split hydrogen on a molecular level through metal-ligand cooperation (Scheme 5 ). The monohydride complex C-1 can react with molecular hydrogen to form the dihydride complex C-1A, the driving force for the reaction being supplied by the aromatization of the pyridine moiety of the ligand. Complex C-1A in turn can transfer the proton and hydride to a suitable acceptor molecule with carbonyl/imine functional groups, regenerating the complex C-1 in the process. Thus, through metal ligand cooperation and ligand aromatization and de-aromatization, complex C-1 and C-2 can effectively hydrogenate organic molecules using molecular H2. In a similar pattern as Milstein et al., Ding et al. demonstrated in 2012 the hydrogenation of cyclic carbonates to CH3OH and diols using several ruthenium PNP pincer complexes (C-3–C-7) under a moderate H2 pressure of 50bar (Scheme 6 ) [27]. The cyclic carbonates can be industrially synthesized by reacting CO2 with epoxides, which in turn can be prepared through controlled oxidation of ethylene, as in the first step of the Omega process developed by Shell Global Solutions that produces ethylene glycol from ethylene oxide through the formation of ethylene carbonate. The hydrogenative products of the cyclic carbonates, methanol and the diol, both hold commercial values and are important for the synthesis of value added products. The authors screened several pincer catalysts for the hydrogenation and catalyst C-3 (with one eq. of KOtBu) was found to be most efficient among them and a highest TON of 87,000 was achieved. Catalyst C-3 was also found to be able to hydrogenate polycarbonates along with cyclic carbonates. Similar to complexes C-1 and C-2, complexes C-3 to C-7 can also split molecular H2 through metal-ligand cooperation (Scheme 7 ). Complex C-3, in the presence of a base such as KOtBu, eliminates H+ and Cl− to form an imido complex C-3A. This imido complex can split H2 to form the dihydride complex C-3B. Complex C-3B acts as the active species for the hydrogenation reaction as it transfers one proton and one hydride to the substrate molecule, regenerating C-3A in the process. However, while discussing the involvement of PNP ligands on different hydrogenation reactions, it should be noted that the traditional idea of non-innocent ligands in pincer catalysts such as C-3 to C-7 has recently been questioned by Gordon et al., who proposed an alternate mechanism based on transition state stabilization provided by N-H or N-Me functionality [28,29]. In 2011, Huff and Sanford showed a cascade catalysis approach in the same pot to directly synthesize methanol from CO2 and H2 under 40bar of 3H2:CO2 mixture using three different homogeneous catalysts, operating in sequence (Scheme 8 ) [30]. This cascade hydrogenation involved three steps: (i) Hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid (step a, 75°C, catalyzed by (PMe3)4Ru(Cl)(OAc), C-9), (ii) esterification of formic acid to formate ester (step b, 75°C, catalyzed by Sc(OTf)3), and (iii) formate ester hydrogenation to methanol (step c, 135°C, catalyzed by (PNN)Ru(CO)(H), C-2). However, due to the incompatibility of catalyst C-2 with Sc(OTf)3, methanol was formed with a very low TON of 2.5. The need to use three distinct catalysts is also a major drawback. Later, Klankermayer, Leitner et al. studied a single molecular ruthenium-phosphine catalyst for the low-temperature hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol [31]. (triphos)Ru(TMM), (TMM-trimethylenemethane) C-10 was used as a catalyst precursor to achieve this transformation at 140°C under 80bar 3:1 H2:CO2 in the presence of an alcohol additive (Scheme 9 ). Ethanol was used as an alcohol additive to stabilize the formate intermediate as ethyl formate, which subsequently underwent hydrogenation to provide methanol with TONs up to 221. In addition, an acid co-catalyst, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (HNTf2), was employed as a weakly coordinating anion to the cationic ruthenium complex C-10A, the active species formed in situ during catalysis. In the absence or with an excess of acid co-catalyst, reduced methanol TONs were observed. A detailed mechanistic study on this catalytic transformation was published subsequently based on NMR experiments and DFT calculations [32]. Catalyst C-10B was identified as a resting state of the catalytic cycle. Even in the absence of an alcohol additive, a TON up to 35 was obtained. Therefore, an alternate pathway was proposed for the formation of methanol from CO2 via formate/formic acid to hydroxymethanolate/formaldehyde and finally methanolate/methanol within the coordination sphere of a cationic Ru-Triphos fragment through a series of hydride transfer and protonolysis steps [32]. Interestingly, when the reaction was performed in an aqueous biphasic system (2-MeTHF-water) instead of THF, the authors were able to recycle catalyst C-10 multiple times and a total TON of 769 was obtained after 4 cycles (TON: 1st cycle=247, 2nd cycle=222, 3rd cycle=191, 4th cycle=110). At the end of the 4th cycle, close to 50% of the initial activity was retained. The previously discussed CO2-to-methanol catalytic systems reported by Sanford [30] and Leitner [31] were operating under acidic conditions. On the other hand, most of the CO2 capture studies are usually accomplished under basic conditions, with amines and amino alcohols being by far the most popular choices for scrubbing CO2. Therefore, the integration of current state of the art capture processes with abovementioned hydrogenation systems under acidic conditions would require two separate steps where, in the first step, CO2 would be captured selectively under basic condition and released in high concentration through desorption (with heat, vacuum, etc.). In a second step, the CO2 would then be utilized to produce fuels (in the present case methanol) under acidic conditions. However, achieving CO2 capture and CO2 utilization under the same conditions is a more desirable route, as it offers several benefits over two-step processes. For instance, utilizing the CO2 capture products (such as carbamates, bicarbonates, carbonates) directly to produce CO2 hydrogenation products (such as formate or methanol) avoids the energy intensive CO2 desorption and CO2 compression steps involved in carbon capture and recycling. To this extent, it is necessary to develop methods for CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH that can be performed under basic conditions, preferably in presence of CO2 capturing functional groups such as amines or amino alcohols. Sanford et al. were the first to achieve a CO2-to-methanol process under basic conditions [33]. A combination of dimethylamine and Ru catalyst was used for this transformation (Schemes 10 and 11 ). In the initial stage of this study, the abilities of the known hydrogenation catalysts C-1, C-2 and C-11 were screened for dimethylammonium dimethylcarbamate (DMC) hydrogenation, among which, the commercially available catalyst C-11 along with K3PO4 was successful in producing methanol. Dimethylammonium formate (DMFA) and dimethylformamide (DMF) intermediates were also observed. The authors hypothesized two possible pathways for the reduction of DMC to methanol and Me2NH. One involved the direct hydrogenation of the carbamate to formamide (path A). The other involved the reduction of free CO2 generated in the reaction mixture upon heating DMC (path B). Among these, pathway B, hydrogenation of free CO2 was found to be the most viable pathway based on careful investigation of the intermediate and product formation (Scheme 10 ). Finally, the authors demonstrated that CO2 gas can also be reduced to methanol by employing a similar strategy. The reaction was conducted at 95°C for 18h (to form DMFA and DMF intermediates from DMC) followed by 155°C for 18h (to form methanol from the DMFA and DMF intermediates), since the decomposition of the catalyst was observed when heated directly to 155°C (Scheme 11 ). 96% of CO2 was converted to a mixture of methanol (22%) and DMF/DMFA (74%). Catalyst decomposition at the operational temperature and the volatile nature of dimethylamine were drawbacks in this system. Shortly after the report by the Sanford group for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH under basic conditions, Ding et al. reported a sequential CO2 reduction to CH3OH in one pot using Ru-MACHO catalyst [RuHClHN(CH2CH2PPh2 ) 2CO; C-3] in the presence of morpholine [34]. In this study, which mainly focused on N-formylation utilizing CO2 and H2, the N-formylation reaction was first performed under 70atm of 1:1 CO2:H2 at 120°C to produce N-formylmorpholine. Consequently, the in situ formed N-formylmorpholine was reduced further in the same pot under 50atm H2 at 160°C for 1h to produce CH3OH with 36% yield (Scheme 12 ). Following the successful demonstration by the Sanford group of homogeneous CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH in the presence of Me2NH, Prakash et al. demonstrated the usefulness of this approach by utilizing CO2 captured directly from air for the synthesis of fuels such as methanol [35]. A polyamine with a low vapor pressure, pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA), was used to capture CO2. The reduction proceeded through the formation of formamides intermediates, similar to the system by Sanford et al. (Scheme 13 ). A series of catalysts based on Ru and Fe pincer complexes (C-3 and C-11 to C-14) were screened for the hydrogenation, out of which catalyst C-11 (Ru-MACHO-BH) was found to be the most effective. Metal ligand coordination was found to be crucial for this reduction as complex C-14, RuHClPN Me PPh(CO), containing a N-CH3 functionality was found ineffective for methanol formation, as opposed to complex C-3, which contains a N-H functionality. With a concentrated CO2 source (3H2: CO2 =75bar), the authors were able to recycle catalyst C-11 multiple times in triglyme, with a total TON of 1850 after the 5th cycle. The products, methanol and water were collected from the reaction mixture between each cycle by simple distillation. The scope of the system was extended, in the same study, to direct CO2 capture from air and its subsequent conversion to methanol (Scheme 14 ). Synthetic air was passed through a 15mL aqueous solution of 3.4mmol PEHA at a flow rate of 200mL/min and after 64h, 5.4mmol of CO2 was captured as carbamate and bicarbonate/carbonate salts. The resulting solution after addition of 10mL triglyme was then treated with 50bar hydrogen pressure at 155°C in the presence of C-11. Under these conditions, a methanol yield of 79% was achieved after 55h. This was the first example of direct CO2 capture from air and subsequent conversion to methanol under homogeneous catalytic conditions. As seen from these studies, all of the CO2-to-methanol homogeneous catalysts employed thus far were based on noble metal complexes, particularly ruthenium phosphine complexes. However, at the beginning of 2017, Beller et al. discovered for this reaction the first non-noble metal catalyzed homogeneous system based on cobalt (Scheme 15 ) [36]. Similar to Leitner’s Ru system described earlier (Scheme 9), Co(acac)3, triphos and HNTf2 were used as catalyst precursors. From the in-situ NMR and MS studies, a cationic Co-triphos species was detected as an active species and the importance of the weakly coordinating anion NTf2 − in stabilizing the cationic Co-triphos fragment was further ascertained. Recently Prakash et al. have reported the sequential hydrogenation of CO2 to CH3OH via formamide in one pot using a Mn-PNP pincer complex C-15 in the presence of an amine (Scheme 16 ) [37]. During the first step of this sequential reduction, N-formylation of an amine was performed in CO2:H2 (1:1) at a pressure of 60–70bar in THF at 110°C. The in situ formed formamide was then hydrogenated in the presence of high H2 pressure (70–80bar) at 150°C to afford the desired product CH3OH with as high as 84% yield (with respect to amine). The highest TON of 36 was observed with morpholine as the amine. The formation of Mn-formate complex (C-16) was observed after the first N-formylation reaction. The catalyst C-16 was also able to reduce ex situ formamide (N-formylmorpholine) to morpholine and CH3OH without a base additive. The authors surmised that complex C-16 is decarboxylated at high H2 pressure to form the manganese hydride species (C-17), which is responsible for the formamide reduction. Iron-catalyzed CO2 to CH3OH has also been reported recently by Pombeiro et al. using a C-scorpionate iron(II) catalyst (C-18) at a much lower temperature of 80°C (Scheme 17 ) [38]. The catalyst [FeCl2{κ3-HC(pz)3}] (C-18) was able to hydrogenate CO2 at 80°C with a total CO2:3H2 pressure of 75bar. A highest TON of 2283 was obtained with a TOF as high as 167 after 12h. The reaction was carried out in the presence of an amine (PEHA or 1,1,3,3-Tetramethylguanidine) or in CH3CN in order to dissolve the gaseous CO2 in the solution. The reduction was proposed to proceed via formic acid and formaldehyde intermediates. A catalytic mechanism involving the generation of hydride Fe complexes such as [FeHCl{κ3-HC(pz)3}] and [FeH2{κ3-HC(pz)3}] followed by CO2 insertion into Fe-H bond to form Fe-OC(O)H complexes was hypothesized by the authors. This represents the first example of an iron catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH and the TON obtained in this study was one of the highest for homogeneous CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH reactions. Also in 2017, Everett et al. demonstrated a system with non-pincer ruthenium complexes for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol via the formation of formamides at a temperature of 180°C (Scheme 18 ) [39]. The authors screened several ruthenium complexes (C-19 to C-24) for this transformation. C-21 and C-22 were found most efficient. Metal ligand cooperation was identified as a key contributor for the catalysis of the second hydrogenation step of formamide to CH3OH. Fundamental studies on the methanol yield with respect to the amine structure revealed that the CH3OH formation increases with increasing steric bulkiness of the employed secondary amine, whereas the amount of formamide intermediate decreased along with a decrease in total CO2 conversion to CH3OH and formamide. The authors hypothesized that the first CO2 to formamide reduction becomes sluggish with increasing amine bulkiness due to the steric congestion in the formed formamide, but the second formamide to CH3OH reduction is accelerated in such cases, resulting in increasing CH3OH yield. A highest TON of 8900 was achieved with catalyst C-22 along with a TOF of 4500, although it should be noted that the extremely low catalyst loading (50 nmol) resulted in an overall decrease in methanol formation in such cases."
2,Conclusion and outlook,"The handful of studies discussed so far represent the recent progresses towards direct homogeneous CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH. Clearly, the development of homogenous catalysts for the production of methanol from CO2 remains in its infancy and has still a long way to go to become practical. TONs must to be improved given the fact that the highest TONs ever reported until now in the literature are only around 9000 [39]. Efficient catalysts need to be identified to make this process practical and eventually industrially viable. Systematic mechanistic studies and rational catalyst design are essential to realize this goal sooner. There is also a need for the development of efficient and robust non-noble metal (Fe, Co, Cu, Mn, etc) based catalysts for more cost-effective methanol production from CO2. Nonetheless, the successful results obtained so far represent important steps towards more efficient methanol synthesis. The direct CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH has been achieved at a temperature as low as 80°C (Scheme 17), displaying the ability of homogeneous molecular catalysts to effectively hydrogenate CO2 to CH3OH under much milder conditions when compared to heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. Catalysts have been developed for both acidic (Schemes 9 and 15) and basic (Schemes 10–14, 16–18) reaction conditions. Recent reports have also demonstrated the ability of inexpensive base-metal based catalysts for this transformation (Schemes 15–17 ). Finally, tandem CO2 capture (including from the air) and subsequent hydrogenation to form CH3OH has also been achieved (Scheme 14 ), indicating a significant step forward for the realization of carbon neutral and carbon negative cycles. The contemporary situation in this scientific field offers plethora of avenues for further research endeavors. Of paramount importance is the development of catalysts with improved TONs and TOFs. In this regard, a second generation of pincer complexes, developed through the optimization of heteroatom substitutions (PNP, PNN) can be of importance. The effect of the ligands’ steric and electronic properties in modulating the ability of catalysts for hydrogenation have not yet been explored. Recent report of an iron scorpionate catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation has certainly also opened the door for further inquiries on other metal scorpionate complexes (eg. V, Ni, Cu, Ru) for this transformation. The previously reported ability of such metal-scorpionate complex in C-H activation and transfer – which played critical role for the selection of such complex for CO2 to CH3OH catalyst screening – reflects the advantage of homogeneous catalysts where rational design is possible. With regards to tandem capture and utilization of CO2, development of systems with recyclable catalyst and capture material is highly desirable for prolonged generation of CH3OH. We believe that the growing interest shown by the scientific community and the recent significant progresses realized in this important field of homogeneous CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH could be crucial steps in the realization of the methanol economy concept"
