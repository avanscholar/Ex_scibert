0,Introduction,"Metal-supported oxides are the source of the most important catalysts in the chemical industry [1–8]. The oxide support basically disperses and supports the metal evenly, and also plays a crucial role in influencing the properties of metal. Catalytic properties are greatly affected by oxide supports, which change the dispersion of active metals [9], increase the stability of metals, provide sites to form a new configuration of adsorbed intermediates, and induce charge transfer at created interfaces [10–16]. Many previous studies demonstrated the improvement in activity as well as the change in selectivity of catalytic reaction, owning to the effect of the oxide–metal interface [17–28]. For example, Pt nanoparticle (NP)-loaded mesoporous oxides showed great enhancements of CO oxidation rates depending on the type of oxides (Co3O4, NiO, MnO2, Fe2O3, and CeO2) [12]. The redox behaviors of the oxides resulted in charge transfer at the oxide–metal interface, which amplified the activity of CO oxidation. Kijeński et al. demonstrated not only strong metal–oxide interaction but also strong oxide–oxide interaction, which affected both catalytic activity and selectivity using the Pt deposited on oxides (SiO2, γ-Al2O3, MgO, TiO2), which were further covered by the transition metal oxide monolayer (TiO2, V2O5, ZrO2) [29]. Thus, choosing an appropriate oxide support is still considered as an important process not only to develop new catalysts but also to understand thoroughly the catalytic phenomena. While fossil fuels are still being used as the main energy source and raw material for chemicals in the global market, the development of alternative materials based on biomass has been steadily progressing to solve environmental problems and reduce dependence on petroleum. Among the biomass derivatives, furfural (FAL) has been identified as one of the most promising chemicals for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals [30–41]. However, its undesirable storage properties requires further upgrade to more stable products in order to incorporate them to a petroleum-derived fuel or use them as chemicals. FAL is catalytically converted into furan (FN), 2-methylfuran (MF), and furfuryl alcohol (FA), through one of various chemical reactions, such as decarbonylation, hydrogenolysis, or hydrogenation. FA can be used as a potential fuel/fuel additive or solvent for the production of resins [40]. The selective deoxygenation to MF is of particular interest because this compound has been proposed as a potential additive to gasoline owning to its suitable energy density, boiling point, and octane number, as well as its being a good chemical intermediate [42–47]. The challenge is to find an efficient catalyst, which possesses high activity and controllable selectivity for the production of highly desirable products, while maintaining long-term stability. Many heterogeneous catalysts have been investigated for the hydrogenation of FAL, with the majority of studies focusing on Cu-, Ni- [48], Ru- [49], Pd- [50–52] or PdCu-based [53,54] systems. Among them, Pd is an ideal catalyst for hydrogenation processes, as it readily dissociates hydrogen under ambient conditions. On Pd catalysts, FAL binds strongly through its aromatic ring, resulting primarily in decarbonylation to produce FN. Processes such as aldehyde hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation, which are desirable for conversion of aldehydes to fuels such as MF, do not occur readily [51]. In this study, three-dimensional ordered mesoporous oxides of Co3O4, MnO2, NiO, CeO2, and Fe2O3 were synthesized through nanocasting from mesoporous silica (SBA-15) and loaded with Pd NPs by chemical reduction to investigate the supporting effects on liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation. The properties of Pd-supported mesoporous oxide catalysts such as oxidation states, redox properties, and metal–support interactions are correlated with catalytic activity and selectivity in FAL hydrogenation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Mesoporous silica SBA-15 with highly ordered hexagonal pore structure was used as a hard template [55,56]. For the preparation of SBA-15, 16 g of pluronic P123 was dissolved in 120 g of water and 480 g of 2 M HCl solution at 40 °C. Then 34 g of TEOS was added into that solution with stirring at 40 °C for 20 h. The mixture was aged at 80 °C overnight without stirring. The solid product was recovered, washed, and air-dried at room temperature. Calcination was carried out by slowly increasing the temperature from room temperature to 550 °C for 8 h and maintaining at 550 °C for 6 h. The nanocasting approach using SBA-15, which was developed by Schüth and co-workers [51,55], was used to prepare mesoporous oxides. Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Mn(NO3)2·xH2O, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) were used without further purification to synthesize mesoporous Co3O4, NiO, MnO2, CeO2, and Fe2O3, respectively [12,57–59]. In a typical synthesis, 24 mmol of metal nitrate was dissolved in 6 mL of water. Then, the solution was added to 6 g of SBA-15 in 30 mL of toluene at 65 °C with stirring. After evaporation of toluene, the resulting sol was collected and dried at 60 °C overnight, followed by calcination at 300 °C for 5 h. The silica templates were removed completely using 2 M aqueous NaOH solution heated to 90 °C followed by washing steps with water and a final drying step at 50 °C. The oxide-supported Pd catalysts were prepared by the chemical reduction method as follows [13]: A predetermined amount of H2PdCl4 solution was added dropwise to a solution of trisodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7, 0.526 mM, Pd/trisodium citrate ratio = 10:1, Sigma-Aldrich, > 98 %), which was maintained at 5 °C under stirring. The sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 0.2 M aqueous solution, Sigma-Aldrich, > 98 %) was then added to adjust the pH of the resulting solution to ∼7. The obtained mesoporous oxides were combined with the Pd solution to give 5 wt.% of Pd. Thereafter, an ice-cold sodium borohydride solution (5 mL of a 0.3 M NaBH4 solution, Sigma-Aldrich, 98 %) was added slowly, and maintained by stirring for 3 h at 5 °C. The catalysts were collected by filtration and washed with deionized water repeatedly until the pH of the filtrate was 6. The final catalysts were retrieved and dried at 105 °C for 5 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Various techniques were used for the characterization of Pd NP supported on mesoporous oxide catalysts. A structure of catalysts was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-1400) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100 F). Surface textural parameters were measured by nitrogen adsorption using a BELSORP-max unit. An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Varian 700-ES) was used for the quantification of Pd loading. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ =0.154056 nm). The Pd dispersion was measured by the CO adsorption capacity using CO chemisorption instrument (Auto ChemⅡ2920, and Micromeritics Instruments Co., USA). Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy by CO adsorption was carried out over Pd-supported oxide catalysts using a spectrometer (Nicolet iS10 FTIR) equipped with a DRIFT cell and mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. Samples were diluted with KBr and loaded into a DRIFT cell (Harrick Scientific) with ZnSe windows. All IR spectra were collected for 128 scans with 4 cm–1 resolution. Samples were pretreated at 150 °C for 1 h under He (flow rate = 1 mL/s). CO adsorption was performed using 0.2 % CO/He (flow rate = 1 mL/s) at room temperature. The collected spectrum was normalized by the number of CO adsorbed on Pd sites from CO chemisorption, which was obtained separately."
4,Catalytic FAL hydrogenation,"2.3 Catalytic FAL hydrogenation A supported Pd catalyst (10 mg) was mixed with FAL (1 g, Acros, 99 %) and isopropanol (20 mL, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 100 mL stainless-steel autoclave reactor (Parr 5500) [13]. After the reactor was sealed, air was purged by flushing four times with hydrogen and then pressurized with hydrogen to 20 bar. If not enough hydrogen was provided, FAL conversion was very low (Fig. S1). The solution containing the supported Pd catalyst was stirred under 600 rpm at 180 °C for 5 h. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst particles were removed from the solution, and the product analysis was conducted by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (FID; Agilent 7820A) equipped with a capillary column (DB-Wax, 30 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness). As a substrate chemical, FA (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 %), THFA (Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %), FN (Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %), THF (Alfa Aesar, 99 %), and MF (Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %) were tested for the identification of products. The product conversion and selectivity were determined as follows: Conversion ( % ) = mol furfural consumed mol furfural fed × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = mol product formed mol furfural consumed × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts Highly dispersed Pd catalysts supported on various mesoporous oxides were prepared by chemical reduction using sodium borohydride, in the presence of trisodium citrate as a stabilizer [13]. The Pd content in Pd/oxide catalysts was determined by ICP-OES as presented in Table 1 . The results confirmed that approximately 5 wt.% of Pd was presented in all samples. The Pd dispersions of the various catalysts were calculated based on CO adsorption measurements (Table 1), with a dispersion of 29.3 % and 28.9 % being achieved for the Pd/Co3O4 and Pd/MnO2 catalysts, respectively, which were significantly greater than those of Pd-supported NiO, CeO2 and Fe2O3. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the Pd/oxides show type IV isotherms with a clear hysteresis loop at 0.4–0.9 of the relative pressure (p/p 0) (Fig. S2), revealing the presence of uniform mesopores. The texture parameters of Pd/oxide catalysts are summarized in Table 1. All Pd/oxide catalysts show high surface areas (82‒172 m2 g−1), in which Pd/Co3O4 (172 m2 g−1) exhibits the highest surface area. Crystallographic information about the prepared oxide and Pd/oxide catalysts is obtained from XRD measurements as shown in Fig. 1 . XRD patterns of the resulting mesoporous oxides are well-matched to Co3O4 (JCPDS 42-1467), MnO2 (JCPDS 04-779), NiO (JCPDS 47-1049), CeO2 (JCPDS 43-1002), and Fe2O3 (JCPDS 33-0664). The broadening and well-resolved diffraction peaks are attributed to the high crystallinity of the mesoporous oxides. No diffraction peaks of Pd species, including Pd0 or PdO, are observed on the Pd/Co3O4, Pd/MnO2, and Pd/NiO catalysts, indicating that the Pd species are highly dispersed on the catalyst surface or Pd atoms and/or ions are incorporated into the crystal lattice of oxides. The peaks corresponding to oxides are shifted in the negative direction after introducing Pd into oxides except Fe2O3 and CeO2, probably due to a crystal lattice distortion. For the Pd/Fe2O3 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts, a small peak at 40° is observed, which is associated with Pd0 (JCPDS 65-2867), suggesting that Pd was segregated and not incorporated into the Fe2O3 and CeO2 structure evenly. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of Pd/oxide catalysts. Apparently, all oxides prepared by the nanocasting method display a well-ordered mesoporous structure. Almost all the obtained catalysts have rod-like morphology, which is replicated from the SBA-15 template, indicating good replication of the silica template. The Pd NPs with sizes smaller than 5 nm were highly dispersed on the surface of mesoporous MnO2 and NiO, while there are some aggregations of Pd particles on mesoporous CeO2 and Fe2O3. This observation is consistent with the CO-TPD and XRD results. Fig. 3 shows the bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (BF-STEM), high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of Pd/Co3O4 and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts. Apparently, the mesoporous Co3O4 displayed a well-defined ordered mesoporous structure, and the loading of Pd did not alter the mesoporous architecture (Fig. 3a–b). As shown in the high-resolution BF-STEM images of the Pd/Co3O4 catalysts (Fig. 3b), the intraplanar spacings (d values) were measured to be approximately 0.47 and 0.22 nm, which closely agree with that of the (111) crystal plane of the standard Co3O4 (JCPDS 42-1467) and that of the (111) crystal plane of the standard Pd (JCPDS 65-2867), respectively. The HAADF-STEM and EDS mapping images (Fig. 3c–f) show a highly dispersed Pd NPs on the surface of the mesoporous Co3O4. In contrast, the Pd NPs of the Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts (Fig. 3g–l) form large aggregates with diameters larger than 6 nm. DRIFT spectroscopy after adsorption of CO as a probe molecule provides valuable information about oxidation states and characteristic metal sites [60–62]. Fig. 4 shows the CO adsorbed DRIFT absorption spectra of various Pd/oxide catalysts at room temperature. The bands at 1800–2300 cm−1 are associated with the adsorbed CO on metal surfaces. Pd/Co3O4, Pd/ MnO2, Pd/NiO, and Pd/CeO2 show two bands at 1971 cm−1 and 2087 cm−1 after CO adsorption which are assigned to metallic Pd0 as a bridge mode and linear CO adsorbed Pd0 sites, respectively. The peak at 2137 cm−1 is ascribed to CO adsorbed on Pd2+ sites [61,62]. The relative molar ratios of PdO/Pd0 calculated by DRIFT spectra (see Fig. S3) are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, no adsorption bands appeared on the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst (Fig. 4). We further conduct DRIFT experiments on Pd/Fe2O3 at different conditions: thermal treatment under He (60 sccm) at 120 °C for 1 h, and oxidation under 20 % O2/He (60 sccm) at 250 °C for 1 h. As shown in Fig. S4a, there are no peaks corresponding to Pd2+ and Pd0 on the Pd/Fe2O3 under He treatment, while the peak at 2137 cm−1 assigned to CO adsorbed on Pd2+ sites, appears on Pd/Fe2O3 after oxidation treatment. The full range DRIFT spectra of CO adsorbed on Pd/oxide catalysts under He treatment (Fig. S4b) show that two bands at 2839 – 2972 cm−1 and 1578 – 1718 cm-1, which are assigned to CH bending and COstretching, respectively, appear only on the Pd/Fe2O3. After oxidation at 250 °C using 20 % of O2/He, these bands disappeared (Fig. S4c). We speculate that the main reason for the absence of CO adsorption on Pd/Fe2O3 in DRIFT spectra is due to the surfactant (trisodium citrate) which covers the Pd surface of the Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst. For the other Pd/oxide catalysts, there is no band corresponding to CH bending and CO stretching, indicating that surfactants are completely removed through the washing and drying steps."
7,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity The hydrogenation of FAL is carried out over the oxide-supported Pd catalysts (5 wt.%) and the mesoporous oxides to examine the effect of metal dispersion and type of support on catalytic activity and selectivity. As shown in Fig. 5 , all as-synthesized mesoporous oxides without Pd loading show a very low activity in FAL conversion. For instance, approximately 3% of FAL conversion was obtained with MnO2, NiO, CeO2, and Fe2O3 and 13 % of FAL conversion with Co3O4. When Pd NPs were loaded into the mesoporous oxides via the chemical reduction, the catalytic activity observed was significantly higher than that of mesoporous oxide without Pd loading. It is clearly observed that the catalytic activity of oxide-supported Pd catalysts on FAL hydrogenation decreased in the order of Pd/Co3O4 (100 %) > Pd/MnO2 (83 %) > Pd/NiO (68 %) > Pd/CeO2 (22 %) > Pd/Fe2O3 (18 %). This catalytic behavior is attributed to two possibilities: first, activity from Pd active sites on the support surface and second, activity at the oxide–metal interface [12]. In Table 1, the Pd dispersion is decreased similarly in the following order: Pd/Co3O4 (29.3 %) > Pd/MnO2 (28.9 %) > Pd/NiO (18.9 %) > Pd/CeO2 (13 %) > Pd/Fe2O3 (2.6 %). This indicates that a high Pd dispersion induces high conversion in FAL hydrogenation reaction. Pd/Co3O4, Pd/MnO2, and Pd/NiO with high Pd dispersion exhibit much higher conversions than Pd/CeO2 and Pd/Fe2O3. Surprisingly, Pd/CeO2 exhibits a catalytic performance similar to Pd/Fe2O3, even though it showed a higher Pd dispersion than Pd/Fe2O3. We also compared FAL conversion over the prepared by the catalysts which prepared by the typical impregnation method (Table S1). While overall FAL conversion of the Pd/oxide prepared by the impregnation were much less than those of Pd/oxides prepared by the chemical reduction, the impregnated Pd/NiO catalyst exhibited the best FAL conversion (50 %) (Fig. S5). In our previous report, chemical reduction by sodium borohydride has already proven to be effective for the preparation of highly dispersed and ultrafine Pd catalyst on various oxides, compared to conventional impregnated Pd/oxide catalysts. When the mesoporous oxide supports were replaced with a commercially avaialble oxide support, the FAL conversion was significantly reduced. For example, when preparing Pd/Co3O4, and Pd/MnO2 catalysts composed of commerial Co3O4 (Sigma-Aldrich, powder <10 μm) and MnO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, powder <10 μm), the FAL conversions were 80 and 16 %, respectively, due to the low surface area and poor Pd dispersion. From these results, it was revealed that Pd/oxides catalysts prepared by the chemical redcution were higly active catalysts for FAL hydrogenation as compared the the impregnated Pd/oxide catalysts. The mesoporous oxides further improved Pd dispersion than commeral oxides with low surface area. In our previous study, mesoporous carbons, including CMK-3, CMK-5, CMK-8, and MSU-F-C, were used as carbon supports to produce Pd/C catalysts to investigate the effect of pore size and structure of carbons [63]. It was revealed that CMK-5 with the largest surface area and hexagonal hollow tubular framework was the most efficient carbon support for Pd/C catalysts, with the highest conversion of FAL in isopropanol. The FAL conversion was greatly influenced by the surface area of carbons and the corresponding Pd dispersion. It is demonstrated that the activity in FAL hydrogenation was determined by the surface area of carbons. In the present study, the effect of mesopores is not prevalent, because the average size and structure of mesoporous Co3O4, MnO2, NiO, CeO2, and Fe2O3 are the same. Depending on the type of mesoprous oxide, the Pd dispersion was varied due to the specific interfacial effect. The DRIFT spectroscopy results during CO adsorption on Pd/oxide catalysts prepared by the chemical reduction after H2 reduction under reaction conditions (180 °C) provide the degree of reduction of surface Pd (Fig. S6). Interestingly, Pd/CeO2 exhibited a lower Pd reducibility than other catalysts. After 1 h pretreatment under a flow of 10 % H2/He at 180 °C, Pd/Co3O4, Pd/MnO2 and Pd/NiO were totally reduced, while there is a peak corresponding to PdO on Pd/CeO2. The intensity of Pd0 peak was decreased over Pd/Co3O4, Pd/MnO2, and Pd/NiO catalysts after reduction, indicating that there was a strong interfacial effect between Pd and oxides (Co3O4, MnO2, and NiO). Therefore, we speculate that the Pd species were fully reduced under the reaction condition except for the Pd/CeO2 catalyst, which induces a low catalytic activity of Pd/CeO2. In catalytic selectivity, the main product obtained by the FAL hydrogenation over the Pd/MnO2, Pd/NiO, Pd/CeO2, and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts was FA, while MF was the dominant product over the Pd/Co3O4 catalyst. Although Pd/MnO2 and Pd/Co3O4 have the same Pd dispersion (approximately 29 %), Pd/Co3O4 exhibits a much higher FAL conversion with preferred selectivity toward MF. While the mesoporous Co3O4 without Pd shows low activity, it is revealed that not only the Pd active site but also the oxide–metal interface contribute to the activity of Pd/Co3O4. As such, the binding energy (BE) shift in XPS spectra of Co3O4 surface before and after Pd loading (Fig. S7) demonstrates the creation of a new interface between Pd and Co3O4. The Co 2p3/2 signal at BE =779.4 eV indicates the presence of surface Co3+, whereas the Co 2p3/2 signal at BE =780.9 eV refers to the surface Co2+. It is observed that after deposition of Pd NPs on a mesoporous Co3O4, the surface Co2+/Co3+ molar ratio increases from 0.76 to 2.16, indicating that the surface Co2+ concentration increases significantly via the reaction of Pd0 + Co3+ → Pd2+ + Co2+. The change in oxidation state of Co3O4 is due to charge transfer from Pd NPs to Co3O4, in which the oxidized Pd2+ species in the Pd/Co3O4 further promotes high distribution of Pd on Co3O4 (Fig. S8). The existence of oxidized Pd2+ species (Fig. S9) and the BE shift in XPS spectra of oxides surface before and after Pd addition on Pd/MnO2, Pd/NiO, Pd/CeO2, and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts (Fig. S10) indicate that new interfaces are generated between Pd and the oxide. Although the original surface area of mesoporous oxides determines the Pd dispersion of the supported catalysts (Table 1), the relative ratio of Pd0 to PdO in the Pd/oxide catalysts further influences the overall catalytic behaviors. In order to confirm the reaction behaviors on Pd/oxide catalysts, FAL hydrogenation was conducted at different reaction times. Fig. 6 a illustrates the FAL conversion as a function of reaction time over Pd/oxide catalysts at 180 °C. Based on the data shown in Fig. 6a, the FAL hydrogenation activities have the following order: Pd/Co3O4 > Pd/MnO2 > Pd/NiO > Pd/CeO2 > Pd/Fe2O3. The first-order dependence of FAL hydrogenation reaction using Pd/oxide catalysts were supported by the linearity of -ln(1 - X) versus time plots in Fig. 6b, where X is the FAL conversion. As the first-order dependence of the reaction was validated, the apparent reaction rate constants of FAL hydrogenation (k app) were determined from the slope of the plot of -ln(1 - X) = k app × t and summarized in Table 2 . The apparent rate constant of Pd/Co3O4 was much greater than those of other catalysts. The k app values were 13 × 10−3, 5.6 × 10−3, 2.4 × 10−3, 1.1 × 10−3, and 0.9 × 10−3 min−1 for Pd/Co3O4, Pd/MnO2, Pd/NiO, Pd/CeO2, and Pd/Fe2O3, respectively. The results also confirmed that Pd/Co3O4 possessed a much higher activity in FAL hydrogenation, compared to Pd/MnO2, Pd/NiO, Pd/CeO2, and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts. To investigate the reaction pathways, Pd/Co3O4 and Pd/MnO2, which have totally different selectivity results were selected and compared for the FAL hydrogenation. The FAL conversion and product selectivity as a function of reaction time are shown in Fig. 7 . As the reaction proceeded, 55 % of FAL was converted along with 40 % of FA selectivity after 1 h reaction over the Pd/Co3O4 catalyst (Fig. 7a). FA reached a maximum yield of 50 % at 2 h and then decreased gradually afterward. The MF yield was very small at the initial time and rapidly increased following the decrease in FA yield. After 10 h, the MF reached a maximum yield of 50 %, while the fraction of FA was very low. The yields of FN and THFA were increased over the entire reaction time until they reached 22 % and 10 % yield, respectively. From these results, it was proven that FAL was converted quickly to FA as a main intermediate with a maximum selectivity at 2 h, and then MF was produced via hydrogenolysis at the expense of FA after 2 h. In contrast, Pd/MnO2 had a significant different selectivity behavior from the Pd/Co3O4 catalyst (Fig. 7b). It was observed that on Pd/MnO2 catalyst, FA was produced as a major product from FAL with a small portion of FN and THFA, while MF was hardly obtained. The yield of FA was increased over the entire reaction time until it reached 60 % yield over Pd/MnO2. These results demonstrate that the FAL hydrogenation over Pd/Co3O4 catalyst occurred by the following pathway: aldehyde hydrogenation toward FA and secondary hydrogenolysis to MF. Meanwhile, Pd/MnO2 promoted only the aldehyde hydrogenation toward FA. To further confirm the reaction pathways over Pd/Co3O4 and Pd/MnO2 catalysts, the hydrogenation of FA was conducted in the same reaction conditions as the FAL hydrogenation. Fig. 8 shows the degradation of FA and product distribution over Pd/Co3O4 and Pd/MnO2 catalysts. Fig. 8a clearly shows that the Pd/Co3O4 catalyst converted all of the FA within 3 h, while approximately 5% of FA was degraded simultaneously in the presence of Pd/MnO2 afterward. It indicates that Pd/MnO2 exhibits no activity for the reaction of FA. Fig. 8b shows the evolution of product distribution as a function of time over Pd/Co3O4 catalyst in the FA hydrogenation. It confirms that on the Pd/Co3O4 catalyst, the yields toward MF, FN, and THFA were increased over the entire reaction until it reached 45, 30, and 15 %, respectively. In the previous study, Pd/C, Pd/SiO2, and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts were used to investigate the contribution of Pd to catalytic activity and selectivity, while carbon, SiO2, and Al2O3 are known as chemically inert supports [13]. Depending on the type of support, the Pd dispersion changed and the resulting FAL conversion also changed. While Pd/C catalyst showed higher FAL conversion than Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3, the FAL conversion and THFA selectivity increased with smaller Pd size or Pd dispersion, reaction temperature and time increased [13]. From these results, it was confirmed that Pd catalyzed FAL hydrogenation is advantageous for producing THFA. However, current research shows that the activity and selectivity changes in various mesoporous oxides supported Pd catalysts due to the specific interfacial effect. For example, the main products of Pd/Co3O4 and Pd/MnO2 are MF and FA, respectively. Based on these results, we found that Pd/Co3O4 catalysts selectively produced MF as a major secondary product via the hydrogenolysis of the CO bond of FA, which was generated from FAL. It was confirmed that the yield of FA was dominant at an initial stage of the FAL hydrogenation over the Pd/Co3O4 catalyst. When the production of FA was maximized, it then decreased at the expense of MF production. It was obvious that a much higher yield of MF was observed, when FA was used as a feed over Pd/Co3O4 instead of FAL. However, over the Pd/MnO2 catalyst, FA was the main reaction product, at which aldehyde hydrogenation toward FA was the preferred reaction pathway for the conversion of FAL. Therefore, when FA was used as a feed, very low activity was observed on the Pd/MnO2 catalyst, indicating that the secondary hydrogenolysis to MF from FA did not occur (Fig. 8a). The extraordinary enhancement of the reaction rate and the changes in selectivity over Pd/Co3O4 compared to other Pd/oxides are illustrated in Scheme 1 . FAL was hydrogenated to FA on the Pd surface, followed by the secondary hydrogenolysis to MF from FA at the interface between Pd and Co3O4 oxide. For the other Pd/oxide catalysts such as Pd/MnO2, only FAL hydrogenation to FA occurs dominantly on the Pd surface."
8,Conclusion,"The highly dispersed Pd NPs deposited on mesoporous oxides of Co3O4, MnO2, NiO, CeO2, and Fe2O3 were prepared via the nanocasting and chemical reduction method for the development of efficient catalysts for liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation. While mesoporous oxides show a trace amount of catalytic activity in FAL hydrogenation, Pd/oxide catalysts greatly enhance the catalytic conversions of FAL depending on the type of mesoporous oxides. The change in support affects the Pd dispersion as well as the redox behavior of Pd species which strongly influence the catalytic activity and selectivity in the FAL hydrogenation. Pd/Co3O4, Pd/MnO2, and Pd/NiO possess a high Pd dispersion, resulting in a high FAL conversion, while low conversions are observed in Pd/CeO2 and Pd/Fe2O3 catalysts owing to their poor Pd dispersion. In the product selectivity, the Pd/Co3O4 catalyst induces predominant production of MF via hydrogenolysis, while other Pd/oxide catalysts prefer the reaction pathway via the aldehyde hydrogenation, yielding FA as the major product. In the hydrogenation of FA instead of FAL, it is revealed that MF as a secondary product is derived from FA via the hydrogenolysis of C–O over the Pd/Co3O4 catalyst, rather than direct formation from FAL. As a result, FAL is hydrogenated to FA preferentially on the Pd surface, and then the secondary hydrogenolysis to MF from FA is further promoted at the interface between Pd and Co3O4. This reaction pathway is totally different from that of Pd/MnO2, which produces FA dominantly. It is also demonstrated that Pd/Fe2O3 shows unusual interfacial behaviors due to the remaining surfactants, which cover the active site of Pd, resulting in a low conversion of FAL. Because the characteristics of the mesoporous oxides determine the Pd-oxide interfaces in the current study, a proper selection of the support facilitates a high catalytic conversion of desired products in many biomass conversions."
