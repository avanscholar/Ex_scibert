0,Background,"Hydrogen-methane breath testing is widely used to evaluate sugar malabsorption (e.g., lactose and fructose) and to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) [1]. Both lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption are specified in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) (codes E73 and E74.1 respectively) [2], and SIBO, referred to as Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome, is listed for the first time in the new ICD-11 (code DA96.00) [3]. A range of diagnostic methods exist, each with advantages and disadvantages – which are comprehensively discussed elsewhere [4–6]. While controversies exist regarding the validity and reliability of breath testing to determine SIBO, the test is widely used [1]. A lack of uniformity in test preparation and interpretation of breath test results has been reported [7], which has implications on the validity of diagnoses between clinics. Patients are advised to prepare for the test in a variety of ways, including; refraining from exercise and smoking; withholding certain medications [6,7]; dietary restriction prior to testing, and an overnight (12-h) water-only fast. A low fibre diet is often recommended as a method of reducing fermentable residue in the colon, thereby ensuring low gas levels at the outset of testing [6,8]. The 2009 Rome Consensus for hydrogen breath testing states “Mouth washing with chlorhexidine solution before test substrate administration prevents oral fermentation of the substrate by bacterial flora of the oral cavity” [6]. That report did not specify values denoting normal or acceptable basal gases. Low baseline (fasting) gases make detection of subsequent increases after ingesting the test substrate more definitive [6]. In practice, various baseline breath gas patterns are seen, including markedly elevated hydrogen, methane or both. Sometimes these remain high throughout the test, or may subsequently decrease as the test progresses [9]. In dentistry it is generally accepted that oral bacteria contribute to the production of volatile gases that play a role in halitosis [10], which can be reduced by the use of oral disinfectants [11]. However, the effect of oral hygiene on basal breath gas levels in hydrogen-methane breath testing is currently under-unexplored. Our aim was to review oral preparation guidelines and criteria currently in use for determining and managing elevated fasting gas values in facilities performing hydrogen-methane breath testing."
1,Method,"A convenience sample of global English-speaking facilities offering hydrogen-methane breath testing services was obtained through an internet search. This was undertaken using Google with the string: “hydrogen methane breath testing” OR “SIBO breath test” AND service OR laboratory. Additionally, a purposive search was made for laboratories known to the author (SE) that were not in the original results. Where readily available online, instructions for patient preparation prior to testing were downloaded for review. Otherwise, email and/or phone contact was made requesting this information, and all facilities were contacted to request criteria currently in use for normal basal values, and how elevations were managed in the clinical testing environment. An exemption for the requirement for ethical approval for the methodology used in this study was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee, University of Sydney (Australia)."
2,Results,"Twenty-five laboratories from six countries provided information regarding breath testing preparation, twenty-two from the internet search and three known to SE. These are presented in Table 1 : eleven hospital or university-associated clinics, five gastroenterology clinics and nine laboratories, seven of which offer services via online ordering of at-home test collection kits. Instructions for oral hygiene prior to breath testing was specified by 18 of the 25 testing facilities. These varied from simply “brush your teeth” (Lab #15), to a range of additional details including: “as normal” (Lab #2), “no toothpaste” (Lab #2), “use toothpaste” (Lab #4), “do not swallow” (Lab #1), “rinse with water” (Lab #3) and “use mouthwash” (Lab #4). With regards to timing, one centre (Lab #5) detailed oral hygiene to be undertaken two hours before commencing the test and one (Lab #19) specified “before coming to clinic”. Administration of a mouthwash both before baseline sample collection and following substrate administration was reported by one facility (Lab #9), whilst another (Lab #24) stated that both toothbrushing and a mouthwash are carried out immediately before testing at the clinic. No other centre described a protocol that ensured consistency of performing oral hygiene, nor monitoring for compliance. Obtaining data regarding fasting breath values from all twenty-five facilities was not achieved. This information was not available online and seven testing centres did not respond to communication or declined to provide these details. Table 2 summarises the responses received from 18 facilities. Seven centres (Lab #1, 4, 18, 19, 20, 23 & 24) regard fasting hydrogen of <20 ppm to be normal, with two (Lab # 18 & 24) applying this parameter for either hydrogen or methane. Thus “normal” ranged from 0−19 ppm for hydrogen, and 3−19 ppm for methane. Four laboratories (Lab # 1, 3, 11 & 19) consider baseline methane irrelevant and two others (Lab #13 & 17) reported that they do not measure methane. Interpretation and management of basal elevations varied greatly. One facility (Lab #17) declared that a peak at 20 min indicated poor oral hygiene. In reviewing pre-test instructions, wide variance regarding diet preparation was also noted, however, it is outside the scope of this report to describe these in detail."
3,Discussion,"Substantial variation in oral preparation instructions and the determination of normal versus abnormal baseline values for hydrogen-methane breath testing exists, suggesting that the diagnosis of carbohydrate malabsorption and SIBO are not standardised. This may impact the inter-clinic validity of diagnostic results and suggests that data presented in research studies may not be comparable. There is inconsistency in the literature about the definition of normal fasting breath gases. A range of levels is common, from 1−85 ppm (mean 13.8, SE1.5 ppm) in healthy subjects [12], and up to 220 ppm in individuals with digestive disorders [13–15]. Peron et al [16] specify combined basal values ≥20 ppm to be “unacceptable”, a cut-off that is reported elsewhere [7,9,17]. Rezaie et al. [7] acknowledged uncertainty in interpretation of tests with such basal levels. Fasting hydrogen <10 ppm has also been described as “normal” by others [18]. As outlined above, baseline gases are commonly above these thresholds, which may reflect normal variances [14], inadequate dietary preparation or ongoing fermentation of carbohydrates consumed prior to test preparation [6,19], fermentation of endogenous glycoproteins [6,20], or may occur due to poor oral hygiene [19]. Elevations at baseline are considered by some to have possible diagnostic implications [13] including SIBO [15]. Oral bacteria, in addition to volatile sulphur compounds, may contribute to hydrogen and methane on the breath. This has been demonstrated following oral rinsing with lactulose [12] and sucrose [21], with resultant increased gas production modifiable by “careful” tooth brushing and chlorhexidine mouthwash [8,12,18,21]. Elevations may persist after antiseptic mouthwash [14], suggesting mechanisms other than oral bacteria may also be involved. Implementing oral hygiene procedures prior to hydrogen-methane breath testing has been recommended [21], including suggestions to carry out a chlorhexidine mouthwash [6,9,19]. However, based on our brief survey, it appears that this advice, is inconsistently followed and not monitored. A lack of understanding regarding both the significance of basal elevations and the impact of varying dietary preparations has been acknowledged [7]. In 1984, Perman et al. lamented the lack of clarity regarding basal breath gases [13], and thirty-five years later things are no clearer. Indeed, two recent publications give conflicting information regarding basal values, with normal being defined by Shimura et al. [18] as under 10 ppm, while Peron et al. considered double this to be acceptable [16]. Neither the 2017 guideline [7], nor the most recent 2020 American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guideline [22] suggest a standard for normal fasting gases, nor how elevations of gases at baseline should be managed. In both research and practice, a variety of breath patterns is seen, including markedly elevated gases, which may remain high throughout testing or may subsequently decrease. The meaning of these variations is largely unexplored. This presents three conundrums: What exactly are “normal” baseline gas levels? What is the clinical implication of baseline elevations? and: How does oral hygiene impact the results upon which diagnoses are made?"
4,Conclusion,"Inconsistencies exist in the definition of “normal” fasting gases, and how this informs both the test procedure and interpretation. Despite the 2009 Rome Consensus specification for oral hygiene prior to breath testing, substantial variation in instructions exists across facilities, which may impact baseline breath gas values. Best practice regarding oral hygiene for breath testing remains unclear and nothing in our investigation indicated that there is a right or wrong method. This is the subject of further research which our group are currently exploring. To improve reliability of diagnostic results obtained from breath testing there is a pressing need for a revision and standardisation of current protocols to address all aspects of test preparation and procedures globally."
