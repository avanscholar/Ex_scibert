0,Introduction,"With the progress in the modern ubiquitous society, miniaturization and high technology for mobile devices are accompanied by the development of downscaled circuits for convenience and portability. However, high integration of the devices is inducing a generation of large amount of heat that accumulates in their enclosures. This heat can damage electronic components, leading to a relatively shorter life expectancy for the electrical and electronic devices. Consequently, design and development of a heat-dissipation material are urgently required. Polymer materials have been used for enclosing these devices owing to their light weight, ease of processing, and high resistance to corrosive environments [1–4]. However, bulk polymers are generally regarded as thermal insulators and typically have thermal conductivities in the order of 0.1 Wm−1K−1. To increase the thermal conductivity of polymer-based materials, extensive research has been conducted on the manufacturing of composite materials by introducing highly thermal conductive fillers such as graphite, carbon black, carbon fibers, metal and metal oxide microparticles [5–7]. However, significant scatter of data for the thermal conductivity of the composite materials have typically been reported, which is caused by several complicated factors such as filler purity, crystallinity, filler size, distribution, and measurement method [8–13]. Heat conductive mechanism is largely divided into two: first, electron heat transfer that is common in metals having free electrons; and second, phonon heat transfer. Phonons are quantized modes of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice and are the primary mechanism of heat conduction in most polymers as they do not have free electrons. In theoretical prediction, the Debye equation (Eq. (1)) is usually used to calculate the thermal conductivity of polymers [14]. (1) λ = C p v l 3 where Cp is the specific heat capacity per unit volume; v is the average phonon velocity; and l is the phonon mean free path. For conventional polymers, thermal conductivities are low because of extremely small l (i.e., a few angstroms). l tends to increase with increase of polymer crystallinity [15–17]. On the other hand, graphene, one of carbon based fillers, is recently gathering significant attention due to exhibiting ultra-high thermal conductivity as well as good mechanical strength, low coefficient of thermal expansion, light weight, low cost, and fair dispersion in polymer matrix [2,18–22]. Thermal conductivity of graphene was theoretically [7] estimated to be as high as 5300 Wm−1K−1 and experimentally [23] in the range of 3080–5150 Wm−1K−1, and it is much higher than Al (200 Wm−1K−1), Au (300 Wm−1K−1), and Cu (400 Wm−1K−1) as general thermal conductive fillers. Although graphene is semimetal due to its zero band gap, it has been reported that thermal conductive mechanism relies on phonon conductivity [23–26]. DL Nika and AA Balandin et al. reported that the contribution of electrons to the thermal conductivity for graphene is less than 1% at room temperature, as an experimental result estimated from Wiedemann–Franz law [24]. Phonon conductivity of graphene-based composite is strongly influenced by the boundary scattering, and can be limited by the agglomeration of graphene that tends to occur through π–π stacking and Van der Waals interactions based on the nanosheet structure with a large aspect ratio. To reduce defects on the boundary and to improve filler distribution, the current study focuses on graphene oxide (GO) that forms a graphene-like single-layer sheet structure except for oxygen functional groups on the basal plane. GO is attracting extensive attention due to its superior compatibility with composite materials, which is attributed to the oxygen groups. In addition, GO is considered as a promising filler because it can be economically produced in mass from graphite through chemical oxidation and exfoliation [27,28]. In this study, composites were prepared from water soluble semi-crystalline polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and well dispersed GO. The GO/PVA composites were prepared with various GO contents and different PVA degrees of polymerization, and their thermal conductivities investigated in terms of molecular interaction based on hydrogen bonding and crystallinity. In addition, the effect of degree of oxidation of GO and silica-bead packing structure on the thermal conductivity of the composites was also investigated on the basis of phonon scattering factors and phonon conductive path."
1,Experimental,"Three types of PVA with different degree of polymerization (DP) were used: DP of 300 (saponification degree of 98%–90%, supplied by Kuraray Co., Ltd., Japan), DP of 500 (saponification degree of 98%, purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan), and DP of 2000 (saponification degree of 98%, purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan). GO was supplied by Nishina group of Okayama University. The structure of GO was evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Rint 2500 HV), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, PerkinElmer Co., Ltd., Frontier), Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Agilent 5500). These evaluations are described in Figs. S1–S3 of the supplementary sheet. Reduced GO (rGO) was prepared through chemical reduction of GO. This entailed adding 1.0 ml of hydrazine monohydrate into a water dispersion containing 20.0 mg of GO stirring at 90 °C for 10, 30, and 60 min, followed by several centrifugation purification and finally drying in a vacuum desiccator. The GO/PVA composites were prepared by mixing PVA solution with varying content of GO-dispersed in water. The mixtures were dried at 50 °C for 1 day to form solid films. The production of the GO/PVA composites with silica beads (supplied by Nissan chemical industries, Ltd., MP-3040, diameter: 300 nm) was based on 10 wt% of completely hydrolyzed PVA with DP of 2000 (PVA2000) in water and 10 wt% of silica beads dispersed in water. The following weight content ratio of silica to PVA2000 was adopted during the mixing: 5:95, 25:75, and 50:50. The GO solution was also added to the silica/PVA2000 mixture at a concentration varying from 0 to 5 wt% of the total mixture weight. Further, the mixtures were vacuum degassed and dried at 50 °C for 2 days. The crystallinity of the composites was evaluated using FTIR (KBr pellet method or attenuated total reflection method) and XRD (40 kV and 200 mA, CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54059 Å with point-by-point detection in 0.02 steps). The diffraction scattering curves in XRD studies were deconvoluted into fundamental Gaussian curves and the degree of crystallinity was calculated using the following formula: α = Ic/(Ic + Ia), where Ic and Ia are the total intensities of all scattering bands of the polymer crystalline phase and the amorphous phase, respectively [29,30]. Thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TGDTA, Seiko instruments Ltd., TGDTA6300) was performed from 80 °C to 600 °C in air. The thermal conductivity was evaluated by laser flash analysis (LFA, NETZCH 447 NanoFlash 300 with Xenon Nano Flash laser at 25 °C). The results were summarized in Tables S2–S4 in the supplementary sheet. The specimen dimensions were 1 cm × 1 cm, and their thicknesses (∼0.1 mm) and weights were measured by micrometer and analytical balance, respectively. The specimens' surfaces were coated with gold (Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Ltd., E-1045 Hitachi Ion Sputter, 10 mA for 60 s) followed by carbon black spraying (Japan Ship Tools Co., Ltd. manufactured DGF)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Effect of PVA degree of polymerization,"3.1 Effect of PVA degree of polymerization Completely hydrolyzed PVAs with various DP of 300, 500, and 2000 were used and denoted in this study as PVA300, PVA500, and PVA2000, respectively. The molecular interactions between GO and PVA were investigated from changes in the O–H stretching vibration band at 3300 cm−1 and the C–O stretching vibration band at 1087 cm−1. It depended on DP and the peaks of the O–H stretching vibration band of PVA300, PVA500, and PVA2000 with GO addition are plotted in Fig. 1 . The peaks of the O–H stretching vibration band of PVA500 without GO or doped with GO at lower concentration were located at lower wavenumber than that of short chain or highly entangled long chain of PVA300 or PVA2000, indicating stronger hydrogen bonding. By GO addition, the O–H stretching vibration bands of PVA300 and PVA2000 were shifted to a lower wavenumber. This was expected from the interactions between GO and PVA, which will contribute to the improvement of thermal conductivity based on increased l and decreased boundary scattering. When increase of crystallinity of PVA, narrow band appears at a maximum wavenumber of 1142 cm−1. This band may be assigned to the C–O stretching vibrations of the crystalline phase or to the C–C stretching vibrations of the carbon framework of the polymer chain in the crystalline phase [31–33]. The degree of crystallinity was given by A1142/A1087, where A1142 and A1087 are the absorbances for the bands at 1142 cm−1 and 1087 cm−1, respectively. The results of crystallinity were plotted against the DP, as shown in Fig. 2 . PVA300 showed the highest crystallinity that tended to increase with GO addition. Therefore, it was assumed that GO addition contributed to the nucleation of crystallization based on the molecular interactions between GO and PVA. However, crystallinity decreased with increasing DP. For PVA2000, crystallinity rather tended to decrease by the addition of GO, indicating a limited contribution of GO in the nucleation and/or crystal growth process due to the entanglement of long chains as shown in Fig. 3 . When the internal structures of GO/PVA were observed by SEM, PVA and GO/PVA300 showed homogeneous structures but apparent defects were observed for GO/PVA2000 (4 wt% of GO) as shown in Fig. 4 . The defects were located between laminated stacks along the thickness direction. It was attributed to the agglomeration of GO due to the strong intramolecular interaction of PVA. Namely, the agglomeration of GO resulted in weaker interfacial interaction in the highly entangled amorphous area which is easily deformed, and the defects might result from the unbalanced stresses acting on the boundary of the agglomeration during the formation of the composites [34–37]. Thermal conductivity was evaluated as 0.402 Wm−1K−1, 0.397 Wm−1K−1, and 0.345 Wm−1K−1 for PVA300, PVA500, and PVA2000, respectively. PVA300 with the highest crystallinity showed the highest thermal conductivity as it has been reported that thermal conductivity is dependent on the degree of crystallinity [15–17]. The thermal conductivity of PVA300 increased by addition of GO up to a maximum value of 0.8 Wm−1K−1 at 4 wt% GO, as shown in Fig. 5 . It might be due to the formation of phonon conductive path by increase of crystalline phase around well-dispersed GO fillers through molecular interaction. On the other hand, no significant changes on thermal conductivity were observed for GO/PVA500 and GO/PVA2000. Therefore, it seems to be closely related to DP caused by competition between intramolecular interaction and intermolecular interaction. However, the thermal conductivity of PVA300 decreased with more than 5 wt% addition of GO. The effect of interaction between GO and PVA on thermal conductivity was investigated from the degradation temperature measured using thermogravity, since the main degradation of GO and PVA is attributed to cleavage of oxygen groups. From the TGDTA results shown in Fig. 6 , it is evident that GO addition from 0 wt% to 5 wt% increased the decomposition temperature from 264 °C to 289 °C for PVA300 although the decomposition temperature of GO was as low as 145°. In addition, decomposition rate in the range of 280 °C–480 °C was a gentle gradient, indicating promotion in thermal decomposition process of PVA was prevented by the addition of GO. This demonstrates that the thermal stability increases with increase of molecular interaction arising from GO addition. Conversely, higher GO content over 5 wt% shifted the decomposition temperature to a lower value that got closer to the curve of bulk GO based on the cleavage of oxygen groups of GO. Therefore, it was demonstrated that agglomeration of GO was induced and the oxygen groups of GO without involving hydrogen bonding with PVA increased. This is supported by that several research groups have reported changes in polymer properties such as viscosity and degradation of GO dispersibility when addition of less than 10% GO [38–40]. It may be due to the geometry of GO with large aspect ratio."
4,Effect of GO oxidation degree,"3.2 Effect of GO oxidation degree To investigate the effect of oxygen groups on phonon heat transfer, the degree of oxidation of GO was varied by reacting it with hydrazine monohydrate for different reaction times. Reduced GO obtained after a reaction time of 10, 30, and 60 min was denoted as rGO10, rGO30, and rGO60, respectively. The oxygen content ratios were evaluated through elemental analysis measurements based on combustion and also by XPS (Fig. S4 in the supplementary sheet). The oxygen content ratios of rGO10, rGO30, and rGO60 were 20.9%, 17.4%, and 14.4%, respectively, as summarized in Table 1 . The thermal conductivity of rGO/PVA300 slightly increased with rGO content, but there was little relation and tendency depending on oxidation degree of rGO, as shown in Fig. 7 . Lower degree of oxidation not only reduces phonon scattering but also decreases molecular interaction between PVA and GO. Therefore, it is considered important to balance the elimination of free oxygen groups involved in phonon scattering and the contribution of oxygen groups to hydrogen bonding and filler distribution, in order to improve phonon conductivity."
5,Effect of silica-bead packing,"3.3 Effect of silica-bead packing To improve the thermal conductivity along the thickness direction, silica beads were added in the GO/PVA composites and were expected to improve phonon conduction along the thickness direction that disturbed the laminated stacking of GO. As silica beads render the composite brittle by creating discontinuity at the interfaces [34], PVA2000 was used for mechanical strengthening of the composites. The internal structure of the GO/PVA composites was observed before and after the silica addition. As shown in Fig. 8 , well-dispersed silica beads were observed. The thermal conductivity of silica/PVA2000 composites was determined to be 0.38 Wm−1K−1, which was shown to be unaffected by silica-bead packing. However, by GO addition, the thermal conductivity of the composites with silica-bead packing at 50 wt% significantly increased as shown in Fig. 9 . It is believed that the phonon conductive path was achieved along the thickness direction, as demonstrated by the improvement in the thermal conductivity."
6,Conclusion,"The thermal conductivity of PVA depended on its degree of crystallinity. PVA with a lower DP showed a higher degree of crystallinity. GO/PVA composites were successfully prepared owing to their high compatibility via hydrogen bonds between PVA and GO. For GO/PVA300, as the crystalline phase formation around GO led to the reduction of the phonon resistance, the thermal conductivity of the composites significantly improved on GO addition. However, increase of oxygen groups not involving hydrogen bonding in the GO/PVA composites with more than 5 wt% of GO resulted in an increase of phonon scattering factors. Dispersity of GO was dependent on the DP of PVA in relation to competition between intramolecular interaction and intermolecular interaction. For GO/PVA2000, there was no improvement in crystallinity and thermal conductivity due to strong intramolecular interaction of PVA. The thermal conductivity of the composite is thus highly dependent on GO concentration and intermolecular interaction between GO and PVA. Finally, a phonon conductive path in the thickness direction was formed by silica-bead packing."
