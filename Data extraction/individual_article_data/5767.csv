0,Introduction,"The decreasing natural gas, coal and petroleum reserves, and increasing consumption rate of these resources highlight the importance of renewable energy. Although the consumption of fossil fuels is restricted because of their high carbon/sulfur contents, these restrictions are not always effective. Thus, environmental problems, such as acid rain, ozone depletion and climate change, arise from the presence of CO2, SO x and NO x in the emission gases. Most of these problems can be alleviated by using clean and renewable energy sources. For this purpose, hydrogen seems to be the most appropriate energy source. Hydrogen fuel cells have been successful in effectively producing energy. Yet a proton source to feed the cells and more investigations are needed for an uninterrupted energy production. In this context, scientists are driven to discover new ways to produce renewable energy carrying systems [1]. Hydrogen occupies the center stage in these efforts as an environment friendly clean fuel, producing no pollution, giving high amounts of energy that is easy to convert to different forms. Practicable use of hydrogen energy is hostage to the easy and feasible hydrogen producing processes and hydrogen storage. Main storage and transportation methods are: storage of the hydrogen within a pressurized steel tank, as a liquid under the cryogenic conditions, on activated carbon, in carbon nanotube, in graphite nanofiber, or in alloys suitable to adsorption and desorption of hydrogen in their structures [2,3]. The mass ratio of stored hydrogen to its container is an important parameter and it should ideally be at least 10%. Metal borohydrides can adsorb hydrogen and store it in solid form. These compounds release hydrogen by thermal decomposition or catalytic desorption. Theoretically, thermal decomposition yields only 10% (by weight) of the hydrogen in the storage medium, unfortunately this ratio is practically limited at 1%. Catalytic approach is advantageous since the hydrogen of the water is also used [4,5]. Some of the metal borohydrides and their properties are listed in Table 1 . Metal borohydrides are the best storage materials in view of their high storage capacity and security. Therefore, these chemicals will be indispensable to supply hydrogen to the fuel cells in near future. Because of this reason, economic and effective production technologies have to be developed. Two (dry and wet) methods are common to synthesize metal borohydrides. According to the desired product and reactants, a suitable method can be used. Especially, the hydrogen recycle system in Fig. 1 or variants thereof must be the concern of scientists. Fig. 1 shows an environmental friendly recycling system for metal borohydride production. The process starts with mined raw boron mineral and continues with the addition of basic chemicals such as H2SO4 and methanol to synthesize the commercially valuable product NaBH4. Moreover, the diagram in Fig. 2 can be thought to be a combination of the main steps of a dry method. This method can be used for both conversion of metal metaborates to their borohydrides [6,7] and production of metal borohydrides from their elements [8]. In this article, we discuss the hydrogen recycle system that contains the whole production steps of wet method and ball milling applications and their technologic problems."
1,Sodium borohydride production,
2,Borax reactions,"2.1 Borax reactions Borax is mined in the form of its hydrides. Mined borax is grinded before it is reacted with sulfuric acid at 90°C as follows: (1) 2CaO·3B2O3·5H2O+2H2SO4 +6 H2O→2 (CaSO4·2H2O)+6H3BO3 Filtration and crystallization are required to purify H3BO3. Since the water in borax hydrides causes some problems in further steps of metal borohydride production, it is sometimes removed by a series of reactions: (2) 1/4Na2B4O7·10H2O+1/2NaOH+5/4H2O→NaBO2·4H2O (3) NaBO2·4H2O→NaBO2 +4H2O [270°C]"
3,Trimethyl borate reactions,"2.2 Trimethyl borate reactions Trimethyl borate B(OCH3)3 is the main reactant in most of the metal borohydride production processes. It is a weak Lewis acid, with various applications in organic synthesis. Trimethyl borate is stored and sold as an azeotrope of methyl alcohol. Generally, the commercial product contains 70% trimethyl borate and the rest is alcohol but 99% pure form is also available. Density of pure trimethyl borate is 0.915g/ml and density measurements can determine the purity of this chemical. Also, titrimetric method [10] or instrumental measurement methods are feasible. Trimethyl borate compound is necessary to form sodium borohydride and can be synthesized by an esterification reaction of boric acid with methyl alcohol in the presence of dehydrants: (4) B ( OH ) 3 + 3 CH 3 OH ⇄ B ( OCH 3 ) 3 + 3 H 2 O (5) Na2B4O7·10H2O+2H2SO4 +16CH3OH→4[B(OCH3)3CH3OH]+2NaHSO4 +17H2O The last reaction is an alternative way of producing trimethyl borate with borax [11]. Moreover, trimethyl borate can be produced with 1,1-dimethyloxicyclohexane or 2,5-dimethyloxi-2,5-dimethyl-1,4-dioxan instead of methanol [12]. During the trimethyl borate production, water is formed and it reverses the reaction, so it has to be taken away from the system. For this purpose, reaction vessel must be filled with enough amount of dehydrant. Dehydrant must not be reactive within reactant. There are many types of dehydrants: CaCl2, LiCl, ZnCl2 and some of the artificial products. From a financial point of view, dehydrant must be chosen economically. CaCl2 seems to be a good option. It is well known that 50–60g of CaCl2 is adequate to dehydrate approximately 255g of reactant. On the other hand, LiCl is twice more expensive but just 25g of LiCl is sufficient to do the same amount of dehydration. Besides, the first azeotropic product trimethyl borate is purer and more if compared with synthesized LiCl. Artificial dehydrants may be financially beneficial and the recycle of them may be achieved simply by thermal desorption. Furthermore, at the reaction temperature trimethyl borate–methanol azeotrope can be removed from the reactor in gas form and condensed by using a basic water cooled condenser. This removal increases the reaction yield."
4,NaBH4 reactions,"2.3 NaBH4 reactions Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a versatile reducing agent in various organic and inorganic processes [13]. NaBH4 is also expected to be the hydrogen carrier and supplier for fuel cells and energy production systems. It can be produced with trimethyl borate and sodium hydride reactants, this reaction is named Rohm–Haas process: (6) 4NaH+B(OCH3)3 →NaBH4 +3NaOCH3 This reaction is generally performed in an autoclave. Reaction chamber must be swept by an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium or argon before the reaction. NaBH4 can also be produced by NaBO2 and hydrogen reaction in the presence of oxide adsorber elements. If the produced amount of NaBH4 is more than laboratory scale, slowly adding trimethyl borate and rapidly transferring the created heat provide more secure circumstances. The reactants must be kept at about 225–275°C and under high pressure during the reaction. Product of the reaction must be purified. Generally, a solvent is used to solve the desired or undesired product, then a crystallization or filtration process takes place. Ammonia, ethylene diamine and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether can be used as a solvent. Each solvent should be applied at its optimum temperature. NaBH4 solubility in diether glycol changes radically with the temperature. Therefore, such solvents improve the purification process. Another way of NaBH4 production is reacting dehydrated borax and sillicium dioxide; (7) Na2B4O7 +16Na+8H2 +7SiO2 →4NaBH4 +7Na2SiO3 The stoichiometric lack of sodium in reaction (7) must be compensated during the reaction. Na2CO3 is a suitable chemical to tolerate sodium inadequately since it causes no oxides. The main step of this process occurred under 3atm hydrogen atmosphere and 450–500°C temperature. Product was taken by leaching with ammonia [14]. Also, elemental sodium and diboran can yield NaBH4 in the diethyl ether if reacted for 24h. (8) 2Na+2B2H6 →NaBH4 +NaB3H8 Sodium hydroxide and diboran reaction is an alternative way of production [15]. (9) 4NaOH+2B2H6 →3NaBH4 +NaBO2 +2H2O"
5,Dehydrogenation,"Hydrogen gas is generated by the thermal and catalytic dehydrogenation of sodium borohydride. Since the hydrogenation is a chemical process catalytic approach is a more favored method [16,17]: (10) NaBH4 +(2+ x)H2O→4H2 +NaBO2·xH2O NaOH must be added to hydrolysis process to suppress the self-hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. Researchers suggest different mass and mole percentage for NaOH addition. According to the reactor type and amount of reactants, NaOH can be added in various amounts but generally in the range of 5–15wt% of reactants. The excess amount of NaOH decreases the hydrogen yield [18]. Mostly NaOH in the amount of 3–5% of reactant is thought to be sufficient to control hydrogen release [19,20]. NaBH4 and catalyst should be continuously mixed in the reactor. Generally 5% NaBH4 and 1% catalyst are enough to obtain considerable amount of hydrogen. As soon as the distilled water is introduced to the system, hydrogen production starts. The time of the hydrogen release depends on the catalyst type and amount. Just 2ml of water is adequate to release all of the hydrogen in NaBH4 and the some of water hydrogen. During the process pH value remains between 12 and 14 because of NaOH presence. Water amount is an important parameter because approximately 95% of the reactant mass is occupied by water. Therefore, NaBH4 has potential to support H2 storage for a portable system only if the water amount is decreased. Fuel cell applications will be possible if low-weight hydrogen engines can be produced. For an automotive hydrogen storage system, the value x in reaction (10) was given by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as 0.84 for applications beyond year 2015. In order to achieve this x value, the water amount must be reduced to 1/15th of what is described above. Reducing water will support manufacturers working hard to create engines lighter than 132kg, which can cover 300 miles with 8kg of hydrogen. In order to achieve hydrogen release with less water, processes that use steam instead of water have been developed. Steam dehydrolysis system has disadvantage because of by-products and NaBO2·H2O which covers the surface of fuel and prevents the steam from reaching deeper [21]. Catalysts can accelerate hydrogen generation from NaBH4. In catalytic applications, surface area of the catalyst is important to provide enough active sites for the molecules to react. Active sites must be homogeneously distributed over the support. Also support material must not be broken or dissolved in NaBH4 alkaline solution. Salts of 3d transition metals have extreme desorption behaviors. PtRu–LiCoO2 catalyst efficiency was found to be twice as high as that of either Ru–LiCoO2 or Pt–LiCoO2 [19]. Zhang et al. studied in detail the kinetics of NaBH4 hydrolysis on Ru-on-carbon catalyst. At low temperatures, zero-order and at high temperatures, first-order kinetic behaviors were obtained. Results demonstrated that the reaction consists of two steps: first, NaBH4 adsorption on the surface, and second, reaction of the adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model led to the conclusion that the adsorption step was responsible for kinetic order variation [20]. Besides, exothermic character of the reaction may shape the reaction order. Thus changes in reaction temperature cause order to shift from zero to first. Hydrogen may be produced from the reformation of petroleum and nature gas with steam–methane, steam–oxygen or auto-thermal reforming. These applications require large equipments and have no chance to be performed within small machines. In comparison to the technologies listed above, NaBH4 is more appropriate as an environmental friendly and renewable energy source because it is pure, controllable, stable, and nonflammable. In order to see effective use of this high capacity hydrogen carrier, NaOH-stabilized NaBH4 solution was investigated with platinum catalyst dispersed on active carbon, carbon black and alumina supports. The Pt/C catalyst was the best among the tested ones because of its high surface area and its stable hydrogen liberation rate of 8.5L/mingPt. Besides, particular sizes of catalysts were investigated to obtain the optimal conditions. It was found that 6wt% Pt content and less than 2nm sized catalyst powder increased the hydrogen release. To obtain such size, the calcination temperature of the catalyst was kept at 300°C [22]. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells are popular power devices and continuous hydrogen feeders. A group of catalyst candidates (Co, Ni, Ru, Pt, and Pt/Ru) were placed on active carbon and γ-Al2O3. Both of the supports keep their physical properties in an alkali solution. However, pore diameters of γ-Al2O3 support are large enough to eliminate the adsorption resistance. One gram of Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst had capacity to feed a system with 220ml/min hydrogen flow for 5.5h [23]. If supporting materials are connected to each other, catalysts can be physically removed from the reaction environment. This technique facilitates the control of hydrogen flow rate. Ingersoll et al. used a Ni–Co–B catalyst that can liberate hydrogen even at 0°C. This catalyst lost its efficiency if NaOH exceeds 15wt% of reactant. Besides, increasing NaBH4 amount resulted in more NaBO2 synthesis. Therefore, optimum reactant amounts must be determined. Moreover, high-NaBH4-concentration systems did not pair well with a Ni–Co including catalyst [18]. In order to dehydrate NaBH4, another catalyst was prepared by reducing nickel (II) acetylacetonate with sodium borohydride in an aqueous solution that was stabilized by hydrogen phosphate anion. Water dispersible nickel (0) nanocluster was found to be very active even at room temperature for 1450 turnover. Hydrolysis of NaBH4 was found first-order in catalyst concentration and zero-order in substrate concentration. Therefore, this catalyst seems appropriate for high concentration hydrolysis of NaBH4 [24]. In response to the demand for supporting all electronic devices perennially with renewable and clean energy, lithium batteries are replaced by fuel cells. Direct liquid fuel cells (DLFCs) have the advantage of using liquid fuel therefore thought to be the appropriate candidate for forthcoming applications. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) can produce more power than DLFCs, but hydrogen supply for PEMFCs is still a problem for portable applications [25]. In order to feed PEMFCs, a system using porous nickel supported Co–B catalyst was constructed. Catalyst preparation procedure was composed of simple doping and drying steps, so this procedure is easy to apply. Various amounts of NaOH did not affect the hydrogen generation at all in the presence of 20wt% NaBH4. 12.5wt% of NaBH4 was adjudged to be optimal concentration for maximum hydrogen generation. The system was capable to produce more than 6l/min hydrogen, which is sufficient to operate 450W PEMFC stack [25]. Although the system has been very successful, purification of water vapor from hydrogen needs further investigation to prevent membrane poisoning. Dehydrogenation processes involve multi-component and multi-phase flow and multi-mode heat and mass transfer. Zhang et al. have a model to predict mass and heat transfer behavior of the fuel cells. This model has two components: first dealing with the non-isothermal water evaporation process and the second dealing with pressure drop through the porous media. Also, a one-dimensional numerical model was developed to study the homogeneous catalyst. Model succeeded to capture the water vapor generation both by chemical reaction and by mass transfer from liquid phase to gas phase. Although the model failed at extreme pressure and temperature values, it is a good starting point to theoretically investigate the water vapor separation phenomenon [26]."
6,NaBO2 recycle,"Hydrogen generation systems are designed to decompose NaBH4 into NaBO2 and hydrogen. In response to the increasing demand for processing the by-product NaBO2, recycling has attracted much economic attention. NaBO2 always contains water molecules in its structure. Water should be taken away for the success of the further processes. In order to dry NaBO2, thermal techniques can be applied in the presence of dehydrants. Generally, bonds of water molecules are broken at about 370°C but for wet sodium metaborate 270°C is enough. Studies for developing new catalysts that can evaluate hydrogen with minimum amount of water may decrease the load on the drying process. There are different ways to convert dried NaBO2 to NaBH4. NaBO2 can react with MgH2 or Mg as in reaction below: (11) NaBO2 +2MgH2 →NaBH4 +2MgO This reaction was run under 0.5–7MPa hydrogen pressure and at 350–750°C. The optimal conditions of the reaction were determined to be 7MPa pressure and 550°C. It is expected that the reaction yields more product as pressure is increased, since the products are not in gas phase. On the contrary, the reaction yielded only 10% because of agglomeration [27]. Agglomeration is a common problem decreasing the yield at high temperature, solid–solid reactions. In order to overcome this, magnesium silicide (MgSi2) or materials alike can be added to the reaction environment [27]. A way to recycle NaBO2 is: processing it with coke and methane as explained by Kojima and Haga [27]. These techniques need catalysts, or high temperature/pressure so they are not cost-effective to prepare NaBH4. Thus, alternative techniques must be searched. Ball milling under hydrogen atmosphere may solve the problem. In an experiment, recycle of the KBO2 reaction was attempted by ball milling to obtain KBH4. NaH, MgH2 and CaH2 were mixed with KBO2 under argon atmosphere. In addition, Fig. 2 lists some extra chemicals that can be potentially used. NaH is thermodynamically unfavorable reactant for the desired reaction and CaH2 was found not effective to yield satisfactorily. Yet, after 120min milling MgH2 gave 32% yield if stoichiometric ratio was applied. Furthermore 100% yield was determined if 35% MgH2 is used in excess. In order to purify the KBH4 as shown in Fig. 2, extraction with ethylene diamine and filtration steps are necessary [28]. NaBO2 conversion to NaBH4 is a process of exchanging oxygen with hydrogen atoms. Different forms of hydrogen molecule can be used for this purpose. “Protide” is another state of hydrogen existing both as liquid and solid states in metal–hydrogen-complex anions. The most reactive form of hydrogen protide can play a role in dynamic hydriding and dehydriding process to obtain NaBH4. This process was based on the transition state of hydrogen between gaseous H2 and protide. The thermal difference between initial and terminal point of the reaction supported the dynamic changes of Mg–H system between hydriding to dehydriding regions. At lower temperatures, Mg–H system tended to form MgH2. On the other hand, at higher temperatures, it tended to dissociate hydrogen under the protide state back to the gas phase. During rapid changes between hydriding and dehydriding states, any hydride formed on the extreme surface of magnesium. It means that hydrogen was only consumed by NaBH4 generation. The extreme surface condition of magnesium during the dynamic temperature changes can lead us to consider magnesium as a catalyst converting H2 to 2H−. Experiments showed that no MgO is produced in the reactor while reactions happen [9]."
7,NaBO2–borax conversion,"4.1 NaBO2–borax conversion The only disadvantage of using NaBH4 as a hydrogen storing material is its cost. It is not easy to react with boron minerals and conversion of by-product such as NaBO2 to NaBH4 needs further research. Electrochemical techniques can be used to obtain borax from hydrolysis reaction with by-product NaBO2. Instead of metaborate, borax can be a starting material for synthesis of NaBH4. Thermodynamically borax tends to result in NaBH4 easily if compared with metaborate. Gibbs free energy to obtain NaBH4 from borax is −239.7kJ/mol but it is −269.7kJ/mol to obtain it from metaborate. Thus less energy consumption is possible if borax is considered as a starting reactant [29]. For this purpose Pd, boron-doped diamond (BDD), Au and Pt were used as electrodes with +1.54V potential for 5h. Pd and BDD electrodes were determined to need less voltage for high yields when compared to Pt electrode. BDD electrode was offered to be the best one since it consumes less energy for water electrolysis [29]. Wet borax may be processed to obtain NaBO2 and remove its water molecules by endothermic application as shown in reactions (2) and (3). Besides, the metaborate may be directly processed by ball milling with hydrides as in Fig. 2. (12) (4–9)MgH2 +Na2B4O7 +X→4NaBH4 +(8–9)MgO+Y In reaction (12), X represents the Na including chemical entering the reaction to compensate for the lacking of Na. Na2CO3, NaOH and Na2O2 can be chosen as X or it is also possible to add no Na including chemical. According to the chemical used as X, stoichiometric coefficient of MgH2 varies between 4 and 9 and CO2 or hydrogen is taken as by-product represented by Y in reaction (12) [7]. NaOH and Na2O2 contain oxide–hydroxide groups. These functional groups are likely to produce undesired products. In ball milling processes, oxygen and water vapor should be avoided. In order to keep them away, usually a glove-box controlled with inert atmosphere is used to wash chemicals with argon. In addition, low Gibbs free energy for reaction with Na2CO3 is an advantage. Consequently, Na2CO3 is the preferable one for this process and experimental results also supported this [7]. According to reaction (12), a bypass may be drawn in Fig. 1 to connect borax and NaBH4. Thus, the process cost and in turn the chances of implementation will improve. Alternatively, borax may be converted to metaborate and alternative procedures may be developed to reach NaBH4. Future studies will indicate which application will serve humanity better."
8,Conclusion,"Idealization for a system, which can recover most of the hydrogen contained by NaBH4 in the presence of catalyst, is studied. Recycling of by-product NaBO2 is an attractive research area therefore thought system is also considered to achieve this indispensable part. It is likely possible to lower 50$/kW energy cost of NaBH4 by recycling and thus it can make fuel cell usage applicable in portable small devices and hydrogen cars. Environmental and commercial requirements force the scientists to regain waste material of dehydrogenations. Conventional techniques have been potentially carried out furthermore new technologies are strongly needed. Among these, electrochemical conversion of NaBO2 to borax and direct synthesis of NaBH4 from borax mineral at extreme surface condition of magnesium seem to have the biggest potential to cut down the costs."
