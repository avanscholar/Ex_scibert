0,Introduction,"The quest for sustainable sources to make natural polymers by using plant resources is increased over a decade of time. This would effect to minimize the creation of wastes and reduce the accumulation of non-biodegradable synthetic materials. The renewable sources like cellulose based thermoplastic help in the reduction of environmental hazard and thereby minimize the impact caused by the petroleum based polymers [1]. Cellulose based nanofibers from natural plants or wood by acid hydrolysis is a significant strategy to prepare the biopolymers [2]. These cellulose nanofibers (CNF) generally have nanosized cellulose particles or fibers with interesting intrinsic properties such as good mechanical strength, high aspect ratio and high surface area-to-volume ratio [3]. Due to this, CNF can further be used to prepare strong composites with unique electric, magnetic and optical properties when compared with the macroscopic materials [4]. There are a lot of sources such as bacteria, tunicates and algae are available for CNF preparation but the fibers from plant sources like wood pulp, cotton fibers, bagasse and flax are abundant, renewable, economical and make thinner fibers when compare with other sources [5]. For example, turmeric rhizomes after the isolation of curcuminoids were used to make antimicrobial CNF [6] which can be utilized to enhance the bioavailability of curcumin [7,8], improve the liposomal stability [9], make feed additive [10], and prepare anti-colitis product [11]. Turmeric CNF were also used to make efficient bionanocomposites by reinforcing with chitosan, starches, gum arabic, maltodextrin and polyethylene glycol [12,13]. Biopolymers like starches, chitosan (CS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) are used to make ‘green’ bionanocomposites [14] and these biopolymers have same disadvantages like high permeability to oxygen and water, low mechanical properties and brittleness. CNF can be used as a filler by reinforcing with these biopolymers and the process of making of bionanocomposites with CNF facilitates to resolve these mentioned problems [4,15,16]. The obtained composite can be used in many applications such as biomedical [17], automotive [18] and drug delivery systems [19] due to their high performance and adaptability. Ginger is one of the largest cultivated products in India with around 0.7 million ton production which is the largest in the world with 33% of share [4]. Ginger oil and oleoresins are the major extracts from ginger rhizomes, and they are used mainly to export worldwide. Hence a large amount of agricultural and agro-industrial biomass remains after the isolation of active ingredients. Making of CNF from ginger agro-residue helps to create an additional profit and reduce the environmental pollution to cope with the new environmental regulations. But there was no further research conducted towards this end, so our research group isolated the ginger nanofiber (GNF) with antibacterial activity and used it as a filler to make starch based bionanocomposites recently [4]. On this context, we have prepared GNF from the ginger waste by acid hydrolysis followed by high pressure homogenization. Obtained GNF was further reinforced with chitosan (CS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to increase the mechanical properties and thermal characteristics of CS and PVA by environmentally benign solvent cast method. CS and PVA are biocompatible thermoplastic polymers which are used for making many bionanocomposites due to their good mechanical properties, processability, biodegradability, biocompatibility and antimicrobial properties which help in biomedical applications and tissue engineering [20–22]. The functional properties of GNF and its CS and PVA composites were determined by several analytical methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) apart from the mechanical studies. Furthermore, the bacterial inhibition of these nanocomposite films were confirmed against bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw materials and chemicals,"2.1 Raw materials and chemicals The ginger spent were collected from Plant Lipids (P) Limited, Kerala, India after the extraction of active constituents. Chitosan (molecular weight 50–190 kDa) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, India, its degree of deacetylation was 75–85% and viscosity was 20–300 cP, 1 wt% in 1% acetic acid at 25 °C. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was obtained from Nice Chemical (P) Limited, Kerala, India. The entire range of chemicals used in this study were analytical grade viz. sodium chlorite (NaClO2), glycerol (C3H8O3), acetic acid (CH3COOH), sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were specially purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Mumbai, India."
3,Preparation of ginger nanofiber (GNF),"2.2 Preparation of ginger nanofiber (GNF) The ginger residue was powdered and cleaned using distilled water to eliminate water soluble impurities and dirt. The cleaned and dried ginger spent powder was utilized to produce GNF as described earlier [4]. Briefly, the ginger spent was subjected to 4% NaOH (w/w) treatment at 80 °C for 3 h to remove the hemicellulose impurities, lignin and pectin. After this, the insoluble residue was treated with 4% sodium chlorite solution to ensure the bleaching and then finally hydrolysis was carried out using 10% H2SO4 at 80 °C to get the microfiber suspension. The obtained fiber was rinsed with water and pressure homogenized using APV 1000 homogenizer (SPX Flow Technology, Germany) at 800 bar pressure with 10 times passing to obtain the GNF which was used to make the composites. The dried ginger rhizomes generally contain 1.5–6% of crude fiber in it [23] and we obtained around 3.1% of GNF after the process."
4,Bionanocomposites production,"2.3 Bionanocomposites production Chitosan (CS) and PVA bionanocomposites were prepared using the GNF by solvent cast method as reported earlier [4]. In brief, the different ratio of GNF suspension was mixed well with formerly made CS (1% CH3COOH in water) or PVA solution (in water) and glycerol (15 wt% on dry basis), was sonicated and stirred well for 30 min. The resulting composite solution was carefully transferred into the petri dish and dried at 60 °C to get uniform thickness of 0.1 ± 5 mm. Different concentrations (1, 3, 5 and 7% of GNF) were used to make CS and PVA composite films. CS and PVA films without GNF also prepared to assess the impact of addition of GNF in the composites. The schematic representation of the preparation of GNF and its CS and PVA composite preparation is depicted in the Scheme 1 ."
5,Materials characterization and measurements,"2.4 Materials characterization and measurements 2.4.1 FTIR analysis FTIR spectra of GNF and its 5% GNF composites was measured by using JASCO ATR-FT/IT-4700, Japan with a range of wavelength 400–4000 cm−1. All the samples were dried well at 80 °C, ground and blended with KBr powder before the analysis. The spectra for individual samples were measured as an average of 32 scans per sample. 2.4.2 SEM analysis The external morphological characterization of samples were recorded using a scanning electron microscope (Vega3 Tescan, Czech Republic). All the samples were mounted in aluminum stubs and coated with gold by an ion sputter coater on a double sided tape to improve electro conductivity. 2.4.3 XRD analysis Powder X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert-Pro, Netherlands) was used to evaluate the crystalline properties of the dried samples using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (wavelength of 0.1541 nm) with a tube voltage 40 kV. All the samples were scanned over the scattering 2θ angles from 5° to 80° with a scanning speed of 1.2°/min. 2.4.4 Tensile properties The tensile characteristics of the GNF and its CS and PVA composites were determined in 8 cm × 0.5 cm dumbbell forms at room temperatures till the elongation breakage using Universal Test Machine (Tinius Olsen, H1KS Benchtop Tester, load cell of 1kN). The samples were attached between the tensile grips with initial grip separation of 50 mm and cross-head speed of 5 mm/min. The results were the average of five measurements of the films. 2.4.5 DSC analysis The calorimetric analysis were conducted by differential scanning calorimeter (Mettler Toledo DSC 822e, Switzerland) to determine the thermal and crystalline behaviors of the GNF and the CS and PVA bionanocomposites. The samples weighed (5–7 mg) into an aluminum pan and analyzed from 0 to 400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and an empty pan was used as reference."
6,Antimicrobial activities,"2.5 Antimicrobial activities GNF and 5% GNF composites with CS and PVA were evaluated for their susceptibility against pathogenic microorganisms by Minimum Inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as discussed earlier [4,24]. Two gram-positive strains (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and two gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium), were chosen for this study, as they are the most common pathogenic microorganisms that affect humans. Briefly, bacterial suspensions of 0.5 McFarland (approximately 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL) were prepared in Mueller-Hinton Agar (MH). Further these suspensions were thinned to accomplish 106 CFU/mL (1:1000) in the broth for the determination of MIC. The prepared GNF, GNF-CS, GNF-PVA and antibiotic (ampicillin as positive control) were placed on MH agar plates, earlier swabbed with the objective bacterial segregate at a concentration of 106 CFU/mL. A negative control was achieved with particular solvents and incubated before measuring the zone of inhibition. Three independent experiments were carried out for triplicate readings."
7,Statistical analysis,2.6 Statistical analysis All the experimental analysis were conceded out in five replicates except antimicrobial analysis which was triplicated. The data were analyzed by One-way ANOVA followed by the Duncan's multiple range test facilitated the statistical comparison by using SPSS 16.0 and the Origin Pro 8.5 statistics program. The resultant disparities were observed as a substantial at 95% (p < .05).
8,Results and discussions,
9,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"3.1 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FT-IR deals with functional group changes and the interaction between molecules of the GNF with CS and PVA. Fig. 1 depicts the spectra of GNF, CS, PVA and 5% GNF composites of CS and PVA. FT-IR spectrum of GNF-CS composite film (Fig. 1d) showed the nanocomposite formation between CS and GNF. The characteristics wavenumbers presented in the CS and GNF also appeared in the composite with slight modifications. Presence of xylan in the GNF is identified by the wavenumber at 1027 cm−1 due to the COC and CH stretching vibrations of cellulose, which is attributed to the high cellulose content in the GNF [25]. The peak about 3300 cm−1 due to the OH vibrational stretching appeared in saturated hydrocarbons in chitosan structure as well as in GNF (Fig. 1a). The wavenumber near 2900 cm−1 showed bending and stretching vibration of CH groups from alkyl groups which is presented in both GNF composites due to the polysaccharide functionality [26,27]. The wave number at 1600 cm−1 is the characteristic peak due to the NH2 deformation vibration which indicates the presence of chitosan [27]. The peak in the area of 3400 cm−1 occurred due to NH stretching vibrations in CS and the GNF-CS composite shows lower peak intensity and shifted to higher range around 3450 cm−1 and peak broadened in the composite, showed the interaction of the NH groups with the OH groups [27]. Similarly, the distinctive peak of GNF at 1648 cm−1 due to cellulose was shifted to higher wavenumber in both CS and PVA composites indicated the formation of hydrogen bonds which indicates the well adhesion between the components [26]. The peak around 3300 cm−1 of GNF-PVA composite film showed higher intensity than GNF and PVA individually and shifted to higher wave number, which confirmed the increasing of OH groups with H-bonding in the GNF-PVA composite. The absorbed water can be identified by the wavenumber 1717 cm−1 which is higher in GNF-PVA than GNF-CS clearly indicated the hygroscopic nature of PVA in comparison with GNF-CS [28]."
10,Scanning electron micrograph (SEM),"3.2 Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) Fig. 2 displays the construction and morphology of the GNF surface before and after the homogenization by the SEM images. Acid hydrolysis leads to an agglomerated cellulose accumulation in micrometer scale (Fig. 2(a)) which can be reduced to a well ordered nanofibers in nm scale by high pressure homogenization which leads to the size reduction experienced by the shear forces due to the high velocity and pressure on the micro-suspension of GNF [29]. The GNF before homogenization existed as an amorphous nature consisted as macromolecules hence there is no clear appearance of crystalline fibers in the suspension. When samples were passed through a homogenization chamber, it involved the high pressure collision of fluid stream which are capable of generating shear rates, disintegrating amorphous regions of GNF, thus reducing the size of the cellulose fibers and ultimately releasing cellulose nanofibers [30]. The obtained GNF consist of fibrous nanostructures with dimensions of 100–200 nm width and 2–3.5 μm length as in the Fig. 2(b). Fig. 3 shows the SEM micrographs of bionanocomposite films of 5% GNF with CS (a) and PVA (b). A rough and potholed morphology is visible in GNF-CS composite due to the tight packing of GNF on CS because of the strong interactions between the two. The balanced dispersion of GNF with CS resulted a dense structure that implies the improvement of the tensile strength [31]. Moreover, the well dispersed GNF-CS composites without any noticeable aggregates formed due to the homogeneous distribution of GNF with CS. Similarly, the SEM micrograph of GNF-PVA indicates a high density regularly diffused matrix which is obtained by the intermolecular electrostatic interactions between the GNF and PVA. The uniform and unbroken dispersion of the GNF in the PVA matrix could imply to increase the mechanical properties of the resultant nanocomposites [32]. The GNF-PVA incorporated surface still persists the fibrous nature due to the finer filling in the composite structure as in the Fig. 3(b) [4]."
11,XRD-analysis,"3.3 XRD-analysis XRD is the key tool to determine crystallinity of the compounds and the effects of the XRD experiments are given in the Fig. 4 which demonstrates the XRD diffractograms for the GNF and its composites with 5% GNF filler in CS and PVA. The characteristics peaks at 2θ = 16° and 23° categorized the presence of the polymorphism structure related to orthorhombic cellulose crystal I and II in GNF and the crystalline environment of GNF developed the stiffness and rigidness of the composites during the reinforcement [33]. Besides, a minor peak at 2θ = 19° in GNF, also associated to cellulose II is the confirmation of the crystalline nature of the GNF and it was disappeared during the biocomposite formation [34]. But, the crystalline nature of GNF is still preserved in the GNF-CS bionanocomposite as the peak at 23° was lowered slightly with a lesser intensity due to the reformation of H-bonds between CS and GNF [35]. Similarly, Torstensen et al., were observed a prominent peak belongs to the distinctive (101) crystalline lattice plane of the PVA at 2θ = 19.4° which was shifted towards to the right as a noticeable peak at 2θ = 19.9° while reinforcing GNF with PVA as expected [36]. Moreover, this peak is related to the semi-crystalline property of the composite due to the better dispersion of GNF in PVA matrix [37]."
12,Tensile properties,"3.4 Tensile properties Tensile properties of GNF-CS and GNF-PVA composites were studied by the three parameters such as tensile strength, Young's modulus and elongation at break. The results are depicted in the Table 1 . The tensile strength and young's modulus of GNF-CS and GNF-PVA bionanocomposites were increased upon the addition of GNF as a filler till 5% and reduced in the 7% when compared with the controls (CS and PVA alone). The interaction of GNF by hydrogen bonding with CS and PVA created a well reinforcing fibrillar network which increased the Young's modulus considerably [38]. Moreover, the addition of glycerol increased the plasticizing effect of nanocomposites and improved the elasticity and permeability [4,39]. The elongation at break gradually reduced while increasing the addition of GNF suggesting the strong interface between the GNF with the CS and PVA molecules resulting the constraint of the molecular and chain movement of the CS and PVA [40]. The elongation at break indicated the CS and PVA films were more flexible than the corresponding GNF composites due to the lesser mechanical resistivity and these results are in agreement with the previous studies [41,42]. The high tensile strength and Young's modulus of the GNF nanocomposites till 5% addition of GNF to CS and PVA indicated a strong interfacial interface by the predominant robust intermolecular H-bonds with hydrogen acceptors of CS and PVA molecules between GNF cellulose [43] and these were seen consistent with the FTIR results. GNF addition gradually increased the stiffness which makes the composites harder and less flexible by reducing the elongation at break and increasing flexural properties especially at 7% addition of GNF [44]. This may be due to the higher dosage of the GNF was directed to the reduction in molecular mobility which increased the stiffness of the CS and PVA composites. This increased stiffness of the composites enhance the brittleness and this further reduced the elongation at the break and the tensile properties with a higher GNF loading [4]. In fact, as loading of GNF increased, a more consistent, organized and inelastic structure was developed which resulted the composites with reduction in elongation [45]."
13,Thermal characteristics of composites by DSC,"3.5 Thermal characteristics of composites by DSC The DSC curves of GNF and 5% of its CS and PVA composites are depicted in the Fig. 5 which revealed the thermal properties. There were significant changes observed in two regions specifically, between 30 °C and 150 °C, equivalent to water vaporization [46] and secondly, between 180 °C and 390 °C, due to the de-polymerization of the constituents in the composites [47,48]. Presence of glycerol in the films softened the endothermic peaks in the DSC curve due to the thermal stabilization and interaction of GNF-glycerol-CS or PVA composites [49]. But, high temperature endothermic sharp peak at 221 °C for 5% GNF-PVA composite represents the degradation endotherm of the PVA [50]. Thermal degradation of GNF can be clearly visible in the range 225–325 °C and these peaks were characteristic to the disintegration mechanism connecting to the essential chains of the composites [51]. From this results, both CS and PVA composites with 5% GNF show good thermal stability."
14,Antibacterial activities of GNF and its 5% GNF-CS and 5% GNF-PVA composites,"3.6 Antibacterial activities of GNF and its 5% GNF-CS and 5% GNF-PVA composites The bacterial susceptibilities of GNF, 5%GNF-CS and 5%GNF-PVA were screened against B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, and S. typhimurium by agar diffusion assay (MIC determination). The MICs were determined as the lowest concentration of the films that inhibit the complete growth of the microbe being tested, which are summarized and presented in Table 2 . All the strains screened were vulnerable to the prepared bionanocomposites with varying degrees of MIC. The solvent control did not have any effect on microorganism growth. Antimicrobial activity of GNF film (13.88 ± 2.0 μg/mL against B. cereus, 12.5 ± 1.35 μg/mL against E. coli, 18.20 ± 0.12 μg/mL against S. aureus and 31.30 ± 0.2 μg/mL against S. typhimurium) was lower than those of its composites, whereas the positive control (ampicillin), exhibited activity of 1.56 ± 0.00 μg/mL against B. cereus, 0.43 ± 00 μg/mL against E. coli, 6.43 ± 0.14 μg/mL against S. aureus and 12.00 ± 0.80 μg/mL against S. typhimurium. Interestingly, a substantial inhibition with lower MIC value were observed for GNF-CS against S. aureus (4.06 ± 1.02 μg/mL). In the interim, the MIC value of GNF-CS film (5.28 ± 1.40 μg/mL against B. cereus, 6.50± 0.89 μg/mL against E. coli and 17.42 ± 0.08 μg/mL against S. typhimurium) were slightly higher in antibacterial activity than those of the prepared GNF-PVA (10.17 ± 0.09 μg/mL against B. cereus, 9.08 ± 0.76 μg/mL against E. coli, 7.11 ± 0.05 μg/mL against S. aureus and 20.00 ± 0.10 μg/mL against S. typhimurium) demonstrating the CS containing GNF film has higher activity. In support of this, current researches on antibacterial activities of CS have exposed that it display a broad range of activities against microbes [52]. One of the reasons is that the bacterial cell wall can adhere to CS by electrostatic interaction, thereby the more adsorbed CS would clearly result in bigger changes in the structure and permeability of the bacterial cell-membrane [53]. Moreover, both CS and PVA composites showed considerably good antimicrobial activity due to the synergistic effect of the components used for the composite preparation. The positive charge of CS and PVA molecules was neutralized via an electrostatic interaction with anionic GNF, thus CS and PVA molecules are evenly distributed through the GNF and 5% GNF nanocomposites exhibited the synergic effect and good antimicrobial activities [54,55]."
15,Conclusions,"The use of nanofibers-obtained from ginger rhizomes after the extraction of bioingredients -to reinforce the CS and PVA nanocomposites has been studied. A very easy and environmentally benign solvent cast method adopted to make the mechanically as well as biologically improved nanocomposites. The tensile strength and Young's modulus were enhanced considerably after the reinforcement of 5% GNF as a filler. SEM images, XRD and DSC analysis proved the composites have a dense and tightly packed matrix due to the H-bond interactions in between. Moreover, these GNF reinforced CS or PVA bionanocomposites showed promising bacterial inhibition towards Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium. Due to the high durability of these GNF composites, they can be used to make packing materials, organ retrieval bags, medical disposables and in breathable wound dressing. Additionally, the use of these agro-industrial-waste in versatile applications would make an extra income for the ginger cultivators and also help in the reduction of waste accumulation."
