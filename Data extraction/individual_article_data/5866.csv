0,Introduction,"Hydrogels are three-dimensional cross-linked polymer networks that absorb large amount of aqueous solutions and can subsequently swell very well [1]. The capability of hydrogels to endure exposure to water and entrap it in their structure without dissolution is due to the presence of hydrophilic groups. They have attracted global attention over the last decades owing to their high water content which leads to diverse applications in contact lenses, drug delivery, wound dressing and sanitary napkins [2]. Hydrogels are typically classified into two categories: i) natural hydrogels such as chitin, chitosan, alginate, gelatin, collagen and silk; and ii) synthetic hydrogels such as polyacrylic acid and polyacrylamides [3]. Typically, existing commercial hydrogels have a relatively small surface to volume ratio and low mechanical properties. These limitations have been limited to their utilization in numerous applications. Therefore, a novel approach was employed to fabricate nanofibrous hydrogel mats incorporating exceptional characteristics of nanofibers with remarkable features [1]. The resultant nanofibrous web prepared by electrospinning demonstrates high aspect ratio, improved mechanical strength, excellent biocompatibility and increased water absorption rate. Electrospinning is a promising technology for fabricating fine fibers with different diameters ranging from a few micrometers up to nanometers [4]. This is one of the versatile techniques mostly used for producing nanofibers from a wide range of polymers. Electrospinning utilizes the electric force to draw a jet of polymer solution out of the spinneret and transforms it into continuous uniaxial fibers accumulating on a grounded collector [5]. Despite the remarkable advantages, one of the most important disadvantages of the conventional electrospinning is low productivity. In order to overcome this problem and to enhance the mass production of nanofibers, a modified electrospinning system equipped with a coaxial spinneret and a gas flow, known as gas-assisted electrospinning, has been introduced [6,7]. This innovative system consists of two concentric nozzles in the coaxial form in which the polymeric solution is charged in the inner nozzle and a gas jet is blown through the outer nozzle. This airflow supplies extra stretching (drag force) surrounding the Taylor cone and therefore assisting the polymeric core to be spun rapidly [8]. Liu and co-workers fabricated a hydrogel nanofiber mat by solution blowing technique. PVA and chitosan were mixed with different quantities of ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) as a cross-linker to react with hydroxyl groups. Significant water absorption of hydrogel combined with bacterial resistance of chitosan resulted in invention of scaffolds served well in wound healing fields [9]. Ju and co-workers employed electroblown spinning to produce honeycomb-like carbon nanofibers based on PVA/PTFE. Different amounts of PVA and PTFE in the mixture triggered multiple pore sizes and distribution of the final structure. This porous PVA-based carbon nanofiber was suggested to be practical in adsorption, ion exchange and catalyst support areas [10]. Ji and co-workers fabricated a hyaluronic acid nanofibrous scaffold by electrospinning to mimic human extracellular matrix (ECM). According to this research, a modified hyaluronic acid called HA-DTPH (3,3′-dithiobis propanoic dihydrazide) was synthesized. Then polyethylene oxide (PEO) was added to HADTPH to enhance fiber formation during the process. The mixture of HA-DTPH/PEO was electrospun and cross-linked by PEGDA. In the end, the PEO was washed away using deionized water to obtain pure HA-DTPH nanofibers being suitable for potential applications in tissue engineering [11]. It is indicated in the literature that PVA is a biocompatible and non-toxic polymer while alginate is a naturally occurring biopolymer that possesses extensive biological properties. The result of various tests on PVA/Alg blend with a higher percentage of alginate exhibits a strong interaction caused by hydrogen bonds which contributes to high thermal stability and desirable mechanical behavior [12]. Recent studies on PVA/Chitosan nanofibers indicated good compatibility and antibacterial properties of chitosan in the mixture that makes it suitable to be used in various medical fields. Agrawal and co-workers applied free-surface electrospinning to develop biodegradable and biocompatible scaffolds based on PVA and chitosan for tissue engineering. Regarding hydrophilicity and swelling behavior of given scaffolds, they were reported to have adequate potential to be employed in clinical applications [13]. In another work, Yang and co-workers fabricated chitosan (CS)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/graphene oxide (GO) nanofibrous membranes and investigated thermal stability, hydrophilicity and antibacterial activity of the composite. The results demonstrated that the developed electrospun nanofibers represented proper antibacterial behavior against two types of bacteria [14]. In this study, poly(vinyl alchol)/chitosan (PVA/CS) nanofibers were prepared via gas assisted electrospinning technique. Therefore, the novelties of the present work are as follows: for the first time, nanofibrous PVA/CS hydrogel was assessed to fabricate hydrogel for the anti-sweating application. PVA/CS nanofibrous mats are biocompatible, eco-friendly and widely used in biomedical, drug delivery and tissue engineering. Secondly, CA was used as a cross-linking agent, due to the fact that it is a harmless component which is used in the food and sanitary industries. Thirdly, the gas-assisted electrospinning as a highly productive spinning method over conventional electrospinning approach, was introduced to fabricated ultrafine PVA/CS fibrous mats. Furthermore, several analyzing techniques including SEM, TEM, DSC, FTIR, swelling behavior and also RMS were conducted to evaluate morphology, chemical properties, swelling behavior and viscosity of the final mats."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Chitosan with 75–85 % deacetylation degree was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyvinyl alcohol with the average molecular weight of 72,000 g/mol, Citric acid with a molecular weight of 192.12 g/mol and pure Acetic acid (AA) were all supplied from Merck. Artificial sweat was prepared using ISO 3160-2. Deionized (DI) water was used in all the experiments. All chemicals were used as-received."
3,Solution preparation and properties,"2.2 Solution preparation and properties First, chitosan powder was dissolved in 2 wt% acetic acid in DI water and it was stirred at 600 rpm (for 12 h) to prepare 1 wt% chitosan solution. Next, PVA powder was dissolved in the DI water by a magnetic stirrer at 600 rpm at ambient temperature for 12 h to prepare 9, 10, 11 wt% PVA solutions. Afterward, 9 wt% PVA solution was thoroughly mixed with 1 wt% chitosan solution to obtain a mixture with different volume ratios of 85/15, 80/20, 75/25, and 70/30, respectively. Finally, various amounts of citric acid (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 wt%) with respect to the dry weight of polymers were added to the mixture of PVA/CS to generate the cross-links which allow the electrospun mat to display as polymeric network hydrogels."
4,Solution properties,"2.3 Solution properties 2.3.1 Viscosity The viscosity of the solutions was measured by a viscometer (Anton Paar SVM3000, Austria, and Europe). This experiment was performed using the rotational viscosity procedure according to ISO 3104 and ASTM D445 standards. 2.3.2 Conductivity To measure the conductivity of the solutions, 10 mL of each solution was placed into a plastic container and examined by a conductivity meter (Hack HQ14D, UK)."
5,Gas-assisted electrospinning,"2.4 Gas-assisted electrospinning Fig. 1 shows the general scheme of the experimental system applied in this work. The experimental set-up includes a coaxial nozzle (21 G needle inside 14 G needle). The mixture of PVA/CS was then injected into the inner channel and the airstream was blown through the outer channel using an oil-free compressor (GAST, USA) with a flow rate of 2 N L/min. Utilizing the airflow in this experimental set-up facilitates the electrospinning process and increases the nanofiber productivity through the addition of an external drag force surrounding the Taylor cone [15]. The applied voltage was set at 18 kV, the nozzle-tip-to-collector distance was fixed at 35 cm, and the polymer injection rate was considered at 180 μL/min. A rotating drum covered by the polyester non-woven (25 g/m2) was used as the grounded collector."
6,Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),"2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) In order to morphology observation of the nanofibrous mats, the surface of gas-assisted electrospun samples was coated with a thin layer of gold and scanned using SEM analyzing system (VEGA-2 TESCAN, Czech Republic) at different magnifications. The fiber diameter was then measured using the Digimizer software (Version: 4.1.1.0). At least 100 fiber diameters from different SEM images were measured and the mean value was then reported."
7,Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM),"2.6 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) First, PVA/CS nanofibers with a volume ratio of 75/25 v/v% were electrospun on a grid (Grid: Cu 200 mesh). Then, to investigate the porosity and presence of the cracks, the transmission electron microscopy (Philips 208S TEM, USA) was employed to observe the entire structure of electrospun nanofibers. The average fiber diameter was evaluated using Digimizer software (Version 4.1.1.0)."
8,Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC),"2.7 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Differential Scanning Calorimetry (METTLER TOLEDO, Switzerland) was used to conduct the thermal analysis on nanofibrous samples based on the endothermic process. PVA and CS powders, as well as PVA/CS nanofibrous mat with a volume ratio of 75/25 v/v% with and without a cross-linking agent, were used for DSC analyzes. The specimens were heated from the room temperature to 250 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min and the nitrogen flow rate was 50 mL/min."
9,Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),"2.8 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (Nexus 870 FTIR, Nicolet Instrument Corporation, USA) was used in the transmission mode. PVA powder, chitosan powder and the electrospun PVA/CS nanofibers with a volume ratio of 75/25 v/v%, with and without cross-linking agent, respectively, were separately placed in a transparent disk in front of the spectrometer beam. Molecular structure and chemical information of the mats were supplied in the spectrum range of 4000−500 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1 in 20 scans."
10,Swelling and gel fraction,"2.9 Swelling and gel fraction In order to assess the water absorption quantity and the swelling behavior of the gas-assisted electrospun hydrogel nanofibrous mat, the swelling test was carried out. First, the weight and the dimensions of the dried nanofibrous mats were measured. Then, the sample was immersed in deionized water for almost 30 min. Excess water was removed by hanging the sample and the new weight and dimensions were measured by digital analytical balance weighting (0.0001 g). Each test was repeated three times and the swelling percentage of the nanofibrous mat was calculated as follows: (1) S w e l l i n g % = W s - W d W d × 100 where Ws is the weight of the swollen nanofibrous mat, and Wd is the weight of the dry nanofibrous mat. To calculate the gel percentage, cross-linked specimens were placed in a vacuum oven at the temperature of 50 °C for 12 h and then were weighed (W1 ). Next, the specimens were placed in distilled water for 12 h at room temperature to separate the sol from the gel. After separation of the sol, the gels were again placed in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h and then were weighed (W2 ). The gelation content was calculated using Eq. (2): (2) G e l f r a c t i o n % = W 2 W 1 × 100"
11,Rheo-Mechanical Spectroscopy (RMS),"2.10 Rheo-Mechanical Spectroscopy (RMS) A cone and plate rheometer (MCR 302) was used to specify the rheological behavior of the fabricated hydrogel at room temperature (the diameter of the cone and the gap between the shearing plates were 50 mm and 1 mm, respectively). About 0.2 g of the nanofibrous mat was weighed and then immersed in 200 mL distilled water and the standard saline solution (analytical grade salt, 0.9 wt%, in water solution). Excess water was removed by a mesh filter, and then hydrogels were inserted into the device in order to evaluate their rheological properties."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Study of the morphology of PVA/CS nanofibers,"3.1 Study of the morphology of PVA/CS nanofibers In order to generate the electrospun chitosan nanofibers, 1, 1.5 and 2 wt% chitosan were selected to be dissolved in 2, 5 and 8 v/v% acetic acid in water solution. It was observed that no fiber was formed. This phenomenon can be explained according to the research performed by El-Heifan and co-workers, who reported that increasing in acetic acid concentration caused chitosan degradation. This can consequently cause reducing the solution viscosity which is not suitable for electrospinning [16]. Fig. 2 A illustrates the effect of acetic acid content on the solution viscosity. As could be observed, addition of the acetic acid led to viscosity reduction. This can be attributed to the degradation of polymer chains or unlocking of the entanglements (see reactions (3) and (4)). In better words, increasing the acetic acid content in water can lead to an increase in the H 3 O + ion content. This can then produce the ChitN H 3 + ion. Consequently, enhancement in ChitN H 3 + ion can increase electrical conductivity [17]. (3) CH3 COOH + H2O ↔ CH3 CO− + H3O+ (4) C h i t - N H 2 + H 3 O + ↔ C h i t N H 3 + + H 2 O Moreover, it was observed that higher chitosan concentrations (>1 %) led to gelation of the solution. Therefore, PVA polymer was selected for blending with CS due to this polymer has sufficient compatibility with CS [18]. In order to make proper PVA/CS nanofiber mat, it is imperative to determine the optimal concentration of PVA. Therefore, PVA was electrospun in different concentrations ranging from 8 to 10 wt%. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the PVA nanofibers. According to the SEM monographs, by increasing the PVA concentration, the nanofibers' diameter increases in the range of 250–430 nm and bead defects reduced. The 9 w% of PVA solution was reported as an optimal concentration which resulted in producing uniform nanofibers with a diameter of 288 nm [18]. Fig. 2B indicates that the addition of PVA increased physical entanglements. It plays a crucial role in increasing the viscosity of the final PVA/CS solution to be electrospun easily. Finally, 1 wt% chitosan in 2 v/v% acetic acid in water solution was prepared to be mixed with 9 wt% PVA in different volume ratios of PVA/CS (85/15, 80/20, 75/25, 70/30) and mixtures were then fabricated. In Fig. 2C, the influence of the various PVA/CS volume ratios on the viscosity and the electrical conductivity was illustrated. It is evident that increasing the amount of chitosan in solution contributes to the reduction of the viscosity since chitosan has lower viscosity than PVA (see Fig. 2C). It is also obvious that the conductivity of the solution significantly improved as a result of chitosan increment. This can be attributed to higher conductivity of chitosan as compared with PVA. This is in a good agreement with the reports in the literature [19,20]. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the PVA/CS nanofibers in various volume ratios (85/15, 80/20, 75/25, 70/30). As could be observed in (Fig. 4A), regardless of witnessing some slight non-uniformity in electrospun nanofibers, they generally can be considered uniform with average diameter of 176.2 nm. Fig. 4B revealed that the PVA/CS nanofibers diameter is reduced as compared with the pure PVA nanofibers diameter (see Fig. 3). It is mostly due to the presence of chitosan with lower viscosity and higher conductivity in the PVA/CS mixture which leads to reduction of mixture viscosity and nanofibers diameter, as well as appearance of the bead defects. Fig. 4C and D also present the effect of the chitosan increment on the morphology and structure of nanofibers. As the volume ratio of chitosan increases, more bead defects are formed and the arrangement of nanofibers decreases, which is clearly evident in Fig. 4D. It can therefore cause non-uniformity in the morphology of the nanofibers. Moreover, increasing the volume ratio of chitosan in the mixture (>30–40 v/v%) makes it difficult to spin. This can be attributed to the repulsive force between the ionic groups inside the main polymer chain which prevents the formation of uniform nanofibers during the electrospinning [20]. Considering the viscosity and conductivity of solutions and morphology of the resultant nanofibers, it is recommended to use the PVA/CS dope solution with the volume ratio of 75/25 in order to obtain more uniformity, proper fiber diameter and fewer bead defects. Fig. 5 illustrates the TEM image of nanofibers using gas-assisted electrospinning of the PVA/CS solution with the volume ratio of 75/25. It can be seen that the resultant nanofibers offer uniform diameter (approx. 80 nm) and a desire single-phase structure."
14,Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),"3.2 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) This is of great importance to distinguish the curing temperature of nanofibers in order to investigate the swelling behavior of the system. For this purpose, the scanning calorimetric test was carried out on four specimens including the PVA and CS powders and the PVA/CS nanofibers with and without CA (see Fig. 6 ). It is observed from the PVA powder that there are two endothermic peaks around 50 °C and 185 °C which are related to the glass transition temperature and the melting temperature, respectively [21]. Two endothermic peaks were also observed for CS powder at 61 and around 112 °C that was related to glass transition temperature and the melting temperature, respectively. The PVA/CS nanofibers graph exhibits two broad endothermic peaks in the ranges of 50–120 °C and around 150–200 °C showing the glass transition temperature and the melting temperature of the mixture, respectively [22]. Eventually, three endothermic peaks appeared in the graph of PVA/CS + CA nanofibers at around 50–120 °C, 150–200 °C which demonstrate the glass transition temperature, the water leakage as a result of the PVA/CS reaction with CA, and the melting temperature of the mixture, respectively. On the other hand, there is an exothermic peak peak at 235 °C which can be related to the cross-linking of PVA and CS."
15,Gel fraction,"3.3 Gel fraction To assign the gel percentage, samples consisting of 10 wt% PVA+10 wt% CA, 2 wt% CS+10 wt% CA and PVA/CS +0.2 wt% CA nanofibers were prepared by film casting and gas-assisted electrospinning, respectively. The same approach has been used in literature [23,24]. The specimens were exposed to the temperature of 140 °C to be partially cross-linked. The gel fraction was calculated using Eq. (2) and the results were presented as follows. According to Table 1 , the gel quantities of the PVA/CA and CS/CA films and PVA/CS + CA nanofibers are about 50 %, 60 % and 50 %, respectively. According to Fig. 6 and the results obtained from DSC test, it is clarified that PVA/CS + CA nanofibers are cross-linked at 235 °C. However, the results of gel fraction assay demonstrate that cross-linking related to the presence of CA occurred at 140 °C and partially cross-linked hydrogel is formed in this temperature."
16,Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"3.4 Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) Fig. 7 provides the FTIR spectra of PVA powder, CS powder, PVA/CS nanofibers, PVA/CS + CA nanofibers before curing, and PVA/CS + CA nanofibers after curing. The characteristic bands in the FTIR spectrum of PVA emerged at 3466, 2916, 1739, 1459, 1089, 1026, 864 and 606 cm−1 for ϑ(OH), ϑ(CH), ϑ(CO), δ(CH2), ϑ(COC), ϑ(CO), ϑ(CC) and γw(OH), respectively [25]. The CS spectrum shows several transmittance peaks at 3453, 2870, 1659, 1570, 1379, 1317, 1078 and 897 cm−1 corresponding to ϑ(NH), ϑ(CH), ϑ(CO)/Amide I, Amide II appeared as a shoulder alongside Amide I, δ(CO), δ(OH/NH)/Amide III, ϑ(COC) and δ(CC). It should be noticed that the peaks appeared at 897 and 1150 cm−1 are related to Saccharide ring, respectively [26]. According to the PVA/CS nanofibers spectrum, the weak transmittance peaks at 3488, 2915, 1729, 1564, 1428, 1374, 1262, 1081, 840 and 681 cm−1 are due to ϑ(NH/OH), ϑ(CH), ϑ(CO), δ(NO), δ(OH), δ(CH), ϑ(CO), ϑ(CN), δ(CC) and δ(CH) bonds, respectively. The graph of PVA/CS + CA nanofibers before curing features the FTIR spectrum which is similar to that of the PVA/CS nanofibers spectrum. According to Fig. 7, incorporation of CA as the cross-linking agent into the PVA/CS solution contributes to an increase in the peaks intensity at 606 to 1723 cm−1 and a smoother peak of ϑ(NH/OH) in the region 3000−3600 cm−1, respectively. Moreover, an intense sharp peak related to the ϑ(CO) bond is specified at 1248 cm−1 due to the reaction of PVA/CS with CA. FTIR spectrum of the PVA/CS + CA nanofibers after curing shows some weak vibrations related to the ϑ(CO) bond created at 2356 cm−1. In addition, the appeared peak in the graph of PVA/CS + CA nanofibers before curing at 1568 cm−1 no longer exists as a result of the heating and curing. Finally, it should be discussed that the peak linked with bending vibrations of the δ(OH) group is intensified at 1324 cm−1 and apparently, this is due to the reaction with the cross-linking agent. Fig. 8 displays the probable mechanism for the reaction of PVA and chitosan. This probable mechanism obtained based on the results from DSC and FTIR tests. According to Fig. 8, when the PVA and chitosan solutions are mixed, they react with each other through intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Subsequently, when the citric acid is added to the mixture, it reacts via the NH2 of chitosan bond and the carboxylic acid group of citric acid. Taken into account that each citric acid molecule has 3 carboxylic acid groups; as a result, it reacts with 3 molecules of chitosan/PVA and 3 molecules of H 2 O are produced, as well [26–28]."
17,Swelling behavior,"3.5 Swelling behavior In order to investigate the swelling behavior and the network efficiency, diverse parameters including concentration of the cross-linker, the curing time and the volume ratio of PVA/CS were examined, properly. For this reason, the gas-assisted electrospun PVA/CS nanofibers containing cross-linking agent were utilized. To determine the effect of curing temperature on the nanofibers swelling, the PVA/CS solution with the volume ratio of 75/25 containing 0.2 wt% CA was cured at 120 °C–160 °C for 5 min. The specimens were soaked in the deionized water for 30 min. The results illustrated in Fig. 9 A. As could be observed, the specimens in 140 °C show a high swelling ratio [29]. Fig. 9B demonstrates the impact of the different amounts of CA on the water absorption of the electrospun PVA/CS nanofibers which were cured at 140 °C. As could be observed, 0.05 wt% CA led to the highest nanofibers swelling, accordingly. To evaluate the influence of the curing time on the swelling behavior of the nanofibers, PVA/CS specimens with volume ratio of 75/25 (v/v%) containing 0.05 wt% CA were cured at 140 °C in various times. As illustrated in Fig. 9C, the optimal curing time is about 5 min. Moreover, the swelling ratio followed the decreasing trend for all three samples which it was the consequence of over-cross linking. Aminyan and Bazgir [30] reported 90,000 % and 30,000 % swelling ratios for the distilled water and saline solution for PAA absorbent, respectively. Lakouraj and co-workers [31] claimed the 1400 % swelling ratio for the PVA/PVP absorbent. Authors discussed that the maximum of swelling was achieved at pH = 7. Maximum extents of swelling were achieved at 25 °C and the swelling of hydrogels was found to decrease at higher temperatures. In another work, Nho and Park [32] used PVA/PVP hydrogels containing chitosan and reported the swelling ratio of approximately 17,000 %. Authors reported that the physical properties of hydrogels, such as gelation and gel strength, were higher when two steps of freezing-thawing and irradiation were conducted as compared with the single freezing-thawing system. The swelling ratio was greatly increased as the composition of chitosan in PVA/PVP–chitosan increased. Furthermore, the impression of different volume ratios of PVA/CS on the water uptake is considered. Fig. 9D shows that the electrospun nanofibers with the volume ratio of 70/30 exhibit more swelling percentage. As could be observed from the morphology observation of the PVA/CS samples, increasing the chitosan content caused lower viscosity and higher conductivity of the mixture (see Fig. 2C). Thus, this can be investigated as the reason for reducing the diameter of nanofibers. As a result, the aspect ratio increased which led to high water absorption and the swelling. When volume ratio of PVA/CS exceeded 70/30, the bead defects start to appear making it difficult to achieve uniform nanofibers with the high water uptake capacity. These results are in a good agreement with the literature [14,32,33]. By employing the variables, the PVA/CS nanofibers with the 70/30 vol ratio containing 0.05 wt% CA cured at 140 °C for 5 min were obtained. Fig. 10 displays the morphology of the developed nanofibers before and after exposure to water. Fig. 10A shows PVA/CS + CA electrospun nanofibers before curing which have uniform and elongated structure. Fig. 10B exhibits PVA/CS + CA electrospun nanofibers after curing step. It can be seen that the orientation extent of nanofibers is reduced, as well the rupture of nanofibers has occurred as a result of heating in some regions and previous uniform order starts to diminish. Fig. 10C and D display PVA/CS + CA nanofibers after swelling and drying, in two different magnifications. Clearly, the diameter of the fibers after a week of drying at room temperature shows a considerable increase. Fiber diameter enhancement can be attributed to the water remaining in the nanofibers and also the curling of oriented polymer chains in the nanofibers due to the plasticizing effect of water molecules. In order to evaluate the swelling behavior, the specimens of electrospun nanofibers were investigated in different environments. Fig. 11 A shows the swelling behavior for different volume ratios of PVA/CS with 0.05 wt% CA which was cured at 140 °C for 5 min. As could be observed, the PVA/CS specimen with the volume ratio of 70/30 represents a greater slope than other specimens. Therefore, this volume ratio exhibits more water uptake and swelling. On the other hand, in the 80/20 vol ratio, the PVA content in the solution increased. This phenomenon resulted in additional increment of the diameter of the nanofibers leading to the lower aspect ratio and the absorption rate. Moreover, in the 65/35 vol ratio, the nanofibers tend to have bead defects which affect the swelling behavior. It was reported in the literature that swelling ration of PVA/CS films was enhanced by increasing volume ratio of CS in the prepared films. Also, fast equilibrium for swelled samples was occurred within 1 h [34]. Fig. 11B shows the relationship between different amounts of the cross-linker and the swelling of PVA/CS with 70/30 (v/v%). It can be concluded that swelling started to decline as the level of CA increased in the mixture. Moreover, the study of the swelling behavior (Fig. 9B) revealed that the reduction in swelling could be attributed to the increase in the citric acid content and the increase in the cross-linking degree. Therefore, 0.05 wt% CA offers as the best swelling percentage and highest slope among the others. Almost 60 min after swelling began, all specimens reached their maximum swelling. Environmental conditions can be counted as one of the prominent parameters affecting swelling behavior. The PVA/CS specimens with volume ratio of 70/30 (containing 0.05 wt% CA) were prepared to be placed in environments with different pH values. Fig. 11C proves that pH reduction facilitated the swelling process. The increase in the swelling ratio with decreasing pH in the solution is mainly due to the presence of amino groups in the chitosan. This phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that chitosan has a flexible helical structure which tends to stretch in acidic conditions. The equilibrium (N H 2 + H + → N H 3 + ) is driven in the right direction, raising the internal osmotic pressure, and the mutual repulsion of charged group supplies the uncoiled force [35]. This hinders polymer chain entanglements and reduces the resistance to the swelling. This can lead to absorbing a large quantity of water. Kim and co-workers [34] reported that the swelling process of hydrogels involves the ionization of amino groups in acid in the acidic buffer solution. The acid would be attached to the hydrogels by ionic bonds. Therefore, the weight of the hydrogels increased in the acidic buffer. At a high pH, the aggregation and intermolecular interactions, as well as the protonation of amino groups have already reached their maximum level. Therefore, the swellability of the hydrogel becomes unchanged in the basic buffer. This pH-sensitive behavior is typical for ionic polymer hydrogels. Another environmental criterion involving in the swelling behavior is the water temperature in which the nanofibers are immersed to swell [36]. To evaluate this parameter, the specimens were placed in the deionized water with pH = 7. As could be observed in Fig. 11D, increasing the water temperature causes the interactions that weaken the entrapped water. This resulted in reducing the swelling ratio. This is in a good agreement with the results reported by Yuan and co-workers [37]. Authors concluded that the swelling degree of the CTS-g-PNIPAAm/PEO hydrogel nanofibers was also dependent on the temperature with lower swelling at 37 °C than that of 25 °C. These results indicate that the nanofibrous hydrogel is indeed pH and thermo-responsive. In order to study the efficacy of the PVA/CS hydrogel nanofibers to be used as anti-sweat absorber which absorbs human sweat, the PVA/CS specimens with the 70/30 vol ratio were soaked in both the simulated sweat and deionized water according to ISO 3160-2. As could be observed, the specimens in deionized water exhibit more absorption rate compared to those immersed in sweat (see Fig. 11E). This can be attributed to the fact that the potential chemical difference in deionized water is very much greater as compared with the artificial sweat which gives rise to further absorption rate and swelling of the hydrogel nanofibers."
18,Rheo-mechanical Spectroscopy (RMS),"3.6 Rheo-mechanical Spectroscopy (RMS) The rheo-mechanical spectroscopy test including the strain sweep and the frequency sweep in the angular frequencies was conducted to accurately examine the viscoelastic behavior and mechanical strength of the swollen hydrogel nanofibers [38]. The strain sweep test was proposed to identify the linear viscoelastic region of the system, whereas the structure and the mechanical strength of nanofibers were characterized by utilizing the frequency sweep test. The PVA/CS hydrogel nanofibers with the volume ratio of 70/30 with 0.05 % CA were cured at 140 °C for 5 min and were then analyzed in the standard 0.9 wt% salt solution and distilled water, respectively. 3.6.1 Strain sweep test The strain sweep test is a practical method that demonstrates a crucial role in measuring the limitation of the linear viscoelastic region when the structure of hydrogel nanofibers remains unchanged [39]. For this reason, the prepared nanofibers were immersed in both deionized water and the standard salt solution and left for 60 min to swell properly. Fig. 12 A demonstrates the value of storage modulus (G') for nanofibers in the (1) salt solution and (2) deionized water, respectively. It is clear that the curve of the G' function exhibits a constant value up to γ = 0.1 % and it can be defined as the critical strain above which the hydrogel nanofibers start to deform. It is worth mentioning that the potential chemical difference in the deionized water is greater than the salt solution leading to an addition of water uptake and swelling of nanofibers. This phenomenon makes polymer structure extend severely and increases the likelihood of the chain breakage which, in turn, decreases the modulus as G'2. 3.6.2 Frequency sweep test After determining γ = 0.1 % as the limiting value of the linear viscoelastic region, frequency sweep test was performed at the angular frequency range of 0.1–100 (rad/s) to evaluate the strength of the hydrogel nanofibers. As depicted in Fig. 12B, four curves related to the functions of G' and G"" can be observed for the nanofibers soaked in (1) the salt solution and (2) the deionized water. According to obtained results, the electrospun nanofibrous networks are developed with quite high elasticity. In addition, the nanofibers in the salt solution have greater values of G' leading to less swelling ratio and high mechanical strength; as a result, the difference between osmotic pressure and ionic stimuli is reduced. Moreover, it can be concluded that the reduction of the osmotic pressure difference in the salt solution causes the solvent to act as a plasticizer for the polymer. It is well-known that the higher the plasticizer content is, the lower the elastic part will be. It is comparatively inferred from Fig. 12B that values of G'(ω) are higher when the gel is swollen in salt solution media [39]."
19,Conclusions,"The facile gas-assisted electrospinning with a polymer injection rate of 180 μL.min−1 was considered to fabricate PVA/CS nanofibers. Observation of the SEM images revealed that the volume ratio of 75/25 resulted in proper morphology for PVA/CS blend solution with mean fiber diameter of about 80 nm. Viscosity and conductivity of the dope solution were simultaneously adjusted for fabricating nanofibers with less morphological defects. Curing behavior was assessed using DSC and FTIR tests. The results of the DSC test showed that the cross-linked peaks were due to the citric acid at 235 ℃, while the results obtained from the swelling tests were found to be at a temperature of 140 ℃, which had the highest swelling rate. The FTIR analysis showed that peaks appearing in the wave number 2356 and 1324 cm−1 related to the stretching vibration of carbonyl groups and bending vibration of acetate groups are due to cross-linking PVA/CS with citric acid. This obviously shows the effectiveness of this item. The study of the equilibrium absorption capacity and the swelling behavior illustrated that the PVA/CS nanofibers with volume ratio 70/30, and 0.05 % citric acid had the highest absorption capacity. Moreover, the swelling behavior of the tested samples had the highest amount of absorption after almost 1 h. However, sample that was investigated in artificial sweat solution was found to have a lower absorption capacity than that of those swollen in the deionized water. It was due to the reduction in the potential chemical difference between the hydrogel and the artificial sweat body. It needs to state that results obtained from the rheological behavior evaluation of hydrogel samples that were swollen in saline solutions exhibited higher resistance and stability. Given these attributes, fabricated PVA/CS nanofibrous hydrogel should be considered as a promising alternative for anti-sweat body absorber."
