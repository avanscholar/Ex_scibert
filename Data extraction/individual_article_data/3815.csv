0,Introduction,"Aldehydes plays a key role in chemical industry and organic synthesis [1,2]. For example, benzaldehyde is an important intermediate or precursor in producing perfumery, pharmaceutical and dyestuff [3–6]. Traditionally, the synthesis method not only requires noble metal (e.g. Pt, Pd or Au) and corrosive oxidants (e.g. KMnO4, V2O5 or K2Cr2O7), but also produces a mass of pollutants and toxic substances against the requirements of green chemistry [7–9]. Therefore, it is inevitable to find a clean catalytic process for efficient synthesis of aldehydes by selective oxidation of alcohols using green energy source and eco-friendly oxidants. Photocatalytic technology is thought to be a green, potential and reliable pathway for green organic synthesis and pollutant degradation, which is carried out in aqueous medium at room temperature without using corrosive oxidants [10,11]. Because the traditional semiconductor materials have low visible light utilization and low selectivity for benzaldehyde, the key to improve the yield of benzaldehyde is to develop new visible light photocatalyst. Over the past few decades, much endeavor has been devoted to utilize solar energy more efficiently with high-efficient photocatalysts. Accordingly, many semiconductor photocatalysts (such as TiO2, CdS, g-C3N4 and Bi2MoO6) have been explored and applied in photocatalysis [10–13]. Among them, TiO2 is one of the most reliable photocatalyst in photocatalysis organic synthesis, degradation and energy conversion owing to its nontoxicity, chemical stability and strong oxidation ability [13–15]. Whereas, pure TiO2 usually shows the poor photocatalytic performance because of its large band gap (Eg > 3.0 eV) and fast electron-hole recombination [16,17]. In order to handle the above problems, many approaches such as combining TiO2 with other semiconductors [17–19], doping TiO2 with metal ions or non-metal ions [20–25], incorporating carbon materials into TiO2 [26,27] and sensitizing TiO2 with dyes [28–31] have been proposed to endow TiO2 with high photocatalytic performance. However, these sensitizing processes may reduce the redox potential of photogenerated carriers and the doping processes with noble metal is relatively expensive. Therefore, the photocatalysts prepared must contain the following advantages: (1) owning a suitable conduction band and valence band position; (2) using inexpensive materials rather than precious metals. Ti3C2, a layered 2D transition metal carbide, attracts more and more scientific researchers because of its high electrical conductivity, excellent structural stability and superior light-absorbing ability [32–37]. Benefitting from the above mentioned advantages, Ti3C2 has been applied to energy storage, hydrogen storage, pollutant adsorption, electrochemistry sensors and so on [38–41]. Moreover, it has been confirmed that the heterogeneous structures between TiO2 and Ti3C2 may facilitate the transformation of charge carriers, to enhance the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers in the field of degradation of organic pollutants, hydrogen production and carbon dioxide reduction [42–47]. However, the application of Ti3C2 to photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol has not been reported. Herein, we firstly report the transformation of Ti3C2 MXene into Ti3C2/TiO2 nanowires as photocatalyst for the oxidation of aromatic alcohols with excellent photoactivity, selectivity and recyclability. The photocatalysts are prepared by in-situ growth through an accessible hydrothermal method and mild chemical processes (Scheme 1 ). Results reveal that this photocatalyst exhibits extraordinary photoactivity due to the introduction of Ti3C2. In our design, Ti3C2 not only acts as the source of titanium but also acts as photogenerated carriers acceptor to accelerate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons (e−) and holes (h+). Moreover, the TiO2 nanowires structure can shorten the diffusion paths for e− and h+ and enhance the light-harvesting capability [31]. Significantly, the intimate contact between Ti3C2 and TiO2 nanowires may facilitate establish a Schottky barrier through their interfaces. The Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst not only has appropriate conduction band (−0.36 V) and valence band (2.04 V) position which make it an attractive photocatalyst for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, but also possesses applicable energy band gap (2.4 eV), improving the light absorption performance. In addition, the feasible reaction mechanism of Ti3C2/TiO2 nanowires photocatalyst under visible light has been proposed in detail. We hope that our study will provide useful information in design of high-efficient photocatalyst applied in the field of photocatalytic organic synthesis."

Hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40 wt%), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), commercial TiO2 (P25) and sodium hydroxide hydroxide (NaOH), are purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. All chemicals used are of analytical reagent grade and deionized (DI) water is used in all experiments."
3,Preparation of Ti3C2 nanosheets,"2.2 Preparation of Ti3C2 nanosheets Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets are prepared by immersing Ti3AlC2 in HF solution according to a previous report [32]. Typically, 4 g Ti3AlC2 powder are dispersed in 300 mL HF solution and stirred at room temperature for 48 h to remove Al layer. Then the solids are centrifuged, rinsed with DI water and dried in vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the Ti3C2 nanosheets."
4,Preparation of Ti3C2/TiO2 nanowires,"2.3 Preparation of Ti3C2/TiO2 nanowires Typically, 200 mg Ti3C2 nanosheets are added into a solution containing 60 mL of 10 M NaOH and 0.7 mL of H2O2. Then, the mixed solution is transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves, which are hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 24 h. The suspension is collected by filtration and the Ti3C2/Na2Ti3O7 nanowires composites are washed with distilled water to neutral and dried in oven at 60 °C for 24 h. Then, Ti3C2/H2Ti3O7 nanowires composites are obtained by acid treatment (0.1 M HCl). After that, the Ti3C2/H2Ti3O7 nanowires composites are washed with deionized water until the filtrate became neutral and freezedried. Finally, the Ti3C2/H2Ti3O7 nanowires composites are heated at 600 °C for 4 h in vacuum at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 to obtain the Ti3C2/TiO2 nanowires (labeled as Ti3C2/TiO2-x, x = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 corresponding to the amount of H2O2) photocatalysts. TiO2 nanowires (labeled as TiO2) are synthesized by the same hydrothermal method with P25 instead of Ti3C2 [48]."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization XRD patterns are acquired on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Miniflex, Rigaku) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher K-Alpha American with an Al Kα X-ray source) is used to measure the elemental composition of samples. The specific surface area is measured by using a nitrogen gas sorption surface area tester (JW-BK222, Beijing JWGB) and calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Raman spectra are recorded at room temperature using (InVia Reflex, Renishaw, UK) with a 532 nm laser excitation in the range of 50–3500 cm−1. The morphology of samples is characterized by FEI Quanta 200F scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) of the samples are recorded by a UV–vis spectrophotometer in the range from 200 nm to 800 nm equipped with an integrated sphere attachment and BaSO4 as a reference standard. PL emission spectra are characterized at room temperature with a luminescence spectrophotometer (FLSP920, Edinburgh Instruments) using a Xenon laser with a 365 nm excitation light."
6,Electrochemical measurement and photocatalytic performance test,"2.5 Electrochemical measurement and photocatalytic performance test The photoelectrochemical measurements are performed on standard three-electrode electrochemical analyzer (CHI 660C instruments, CHI, China) system. A 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution is employed as the electrolyte. The catalyst powder is deposited on the fluoride tin oxide (FTO) substrate to serve as the working electrode. Pt wire and Ag/AgCl immersed in the filling solution (saturated KCl) are respectively utilized as counter and reference electrodes in this electrochemical analyzer system. A 300 W Xenon lamp (MICROSOLAR300UV, Beijing Perfect light) equipped with a 400 nm cut off filter (λ > 400 nm) is applied as a visible light source."
7,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"2.6 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts are evaluated by the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. In a typical reaction, 20 mg of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst and 0.1 mmol of alcohol are added to 4 mL of acetonitrile (CH3CN) in an optical quartz tube. Before illumination, O2 is passed through the solution and the suspension is magnetically stirred for 30 min to reach adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Irradiation is carried out using a 300 W Xenon lamp with an ultraviolet cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm). The temperature of the reaction solution is maintained at approximately 25 °C by circulating cold water through the outer jacket of the Xenon lamp. After the photocatalytic reaction, the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalyst are separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and the products are quantitatively analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS-QP2010 SE) with an FID detector using nitrobenzene as the internal standard. Conversion of alcohol, yield of aldehyde and selectivity for aldehyde are defined as following: Conversion ( % ) = C 0 - C alcohol / C 0 × 100 yield ( % ) = C aldehyde / C 0 × 100 selectivity ( % ) = C aldehyde / C 0 - C alcohol × 100 where C0 is the initial concentration of alcohol and Calcohol and Caldehyde are the concentrations of the substrate alcohol and the corresponding aldehyde, respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The morphology of Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 1 ). Apparently these four Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts display a nanowire structure. Moreover, the nanowires become longer and thinner from Fig. 1a to Fig. 1d. That is to say, the nanowires are longer and thinner (range from 4 μm to 8 μm) when the amount of H2O2 added is increase (from 0.3 mL to 0.9 mL). It is not conducive to form the TiO2 nanowires when the content of TiO2 is low (the Ti3C2 is less oxidized). However, when the content of TiO2 gradually increase, it is easy to form a thinner and longer nanowire structure. The SEM images of TiO2 nanowires and P25 are illustrated in Fig. S1. The XRD patterns of the Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets are shown in Fig. 2 a. The disappearance of the strongest diffraction peak of Ti3AlC2 at 39° and the shift of the (0 0 2) at 9.6° and (0 0 4) at 19.2° diffraction peaks to lower degrees indicate the transformation from Ti3AlC2 to Ti3C2 by HF etching [48,49]. The prepared Ti3C2 exhibits a hierarchical accordion-like structure (Fig. S2). In addition, the XRD patterns of the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts and Ti3C2 nanosheets are shown in Fig. 2b. New diffraction peaks are assigned to anatase TiO2 and TiO2(B) [50]. The diffraction peaks intensity of TiO2 gradually enhance along with increasing the amount of H2O2. Fig. 2c exhibits a magnified XRD patterns of these samples ranging from 30° to 65°. In the four samples, characteristic peaks attribute to Ti3C2 located at 36°, 44° and 61° are still retained, suggesting the successful synthesis of the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalyst. The intensity of diffraction peaks of the Ti3C2 decrease gradually, which is due to the conversion of Ti3C2 into TiO2 with increase the amount of H2O2. To further confirm their structure, Raman spectroscopy is performed to demonstrate whether there would be the formation of amorphous carbon in the oxidation process (Fig. 2d). The Raman patterns exhibit two carbon-related peaks, the disordered peak (D band) of 1340 cm−1 and graphitic structures peak (G band) of 1590 cm−1 reveal the presence of carbon layer in Ti3C2. However, there are no obvious D band and G band in Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7, indicating that there is no carbon in it after the synthesis process. The characteristic peaks at 148, 260, 414, and 604 cm−1 can be attributed to Ti3C2 [32]. In addition, the coexistence of the two TiO2 phases can also be confirmed by their corresponding characteristic peaks (range from 150 nm to 650 nm) in the Raman spectra of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 [45]. The Raman and XRD characterizations reveal that the successful synthesis of Ti3C2/TiO2 is achieved by the following reaction equations: (1) Ti3C2 + 10H2O2 + 6NaOH → Na2Ti3O7 + 2Na2CO3 + 13H2O (2) Na2Ti3O7 + 2HCl → H2Ti3O7 + 2NaCl (3) H2Ti3O7 → 3TiO2 + H2O The detailed crystallographic relationship between TiO2 and Ti3C2 in Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 has been observed in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. As shown in Fig. 3 a, there are obvious nanowire-like composites stacked together randomly. Fig. 3b indicates the interfacial structure between the TiO2 and Ti3C2. In detail, the lattices with d spaces of 0.986 nm, 0.358 nm and 0.602 nm can be clearly found, corresponding to (0 0 2) crystal planes of Ti3C2, (1 0 1) crystal planes of anatase TiO2 and (2 0 0) crystal planes of TiO2(B) [44,45,50,51], respectively. The results demonstrate the successful formation of the Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst. Furthermore, the formation of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst are verified by EDS mapping of Ti, O and C. As shown in Fig. 3c, the uniform distribution of the three elements is illustrated that the Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst is successfully synthesized and the Ti3C2 is uniformly distributed on the TiO2 nanowires. The EDS spectra (Fig. S3) demonstrate that the content of Ti3C2 in TiO2/Ti3C2 photocatalysts is consistent with that of XPS. The changes of the surface compositions and chemical states of the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts are further confirmed by XPS. In Fig. 4 a, the XPS survey analysis of the as-prepared Ti3C2 and Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst show the presence of Ti, O, C and F, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, 8 different peaks can be find in the high resolution Ti 2p. The peaks at 454.8, 455.8, 457.9, 458.6, 460.3, 461.3, 463.0 and 464.7 eV are correspond to the Ti-C (2p3), Ti-X (2p3 from substoichiometric TiCx (x < 1) or titanium oxycarbides), TixOy (2p3), Ti4+ (2p3 from TiO2), Ti-C (2p1), Ti-X (2p1 from substoichiometric TiCx (x < 1) or titanium oxycarbides), TixOy (2p1) and Ti4+ (2p1 from TiO2) [44–47,52,53], respectively. In addition, the emergence of the TiO2 peak in the XPS spectrum of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 is accompanied by the decrease of all the other peaks, indicating that Ti3C2 is consumed and transformed to TiO2 upon the hydrothermal treatment. As shown in Fig. 4c, the O 1s spectrum of layered Ti3C2 are fitted by four components located at 529.6, 530.4, 531.7 and 533.3 eV, corresponding to adsorbed O species, TiOTi, TiOH and COH bonds [44], respectively. The peak of TiOTi is greatly increased for the Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 than that of Ti3C2. This result further demonstrates Ti3C2 is consumed and transformed to TiO2. With respect to the C 1s XPS spectra of Ti3C2 in Fig. 4d, 5 different peaks can be find in the high resolution C 1s, which are located at 281.8, 282.2, 284.8, 286.2 and 288.6 eV, corresponding to CTi, CTiO, CC, CO and CF bonds, respectively [44,45]. The intensity of C-Ti decreased substantially, which again demonstrates that the TiO2 is formed accompanying the consumption of Ti3C2. Furthermore, the elemental analysis and the mass fraction of Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts are shown in Tables S1 and S2. The molar ratios of Ti3C2 in Ti3C2/TiO2-0.3, Ti3C2/TiO2-0.5, Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 and Ti3C2/TiO2-0.9 are 47.26%, 29.29%, 16.99% and 6.15%, respectively. Additionally, the results of TG are consistent with those of XPS (Fig. S6). The chemical structure of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 and Ti3C2 are further analyzed by FT-IR spectra. As Fig. 4e shows, the characteristic absorption peaks of TiO2 are observed at 468, 790 and 980 cm−1 [50]. The two weak peaks (the inset of Fig. 4e) at 547 and 613 cm−1 of Ti3C2 are assigned as the TiO deformation vibration between the titanium atom on the surface of Ti3C2 and the terminated OH [45]. These are not detected in Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 is due to the low content of Ti3C2. The two signals at 1640 cm−1 and 3400 cm−1 (Fig. 4f) can be ascribed to the OH, which terminated on the Ti3C2 and Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 [45,50,54]. The intensity of OH increased in the spectra of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 upon the hydrothermal treatment. This result gives a reasonable explanation for the good dispersion performance of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst in the solvent."
10,Photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity The activity of the as-prepared photocatalysts are tested by selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The effect of reaction conditions on photocatalytic activity are investigated in depth. Although, the conversion rate of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 is the highest in the four photocatalysts (Table S3), the conversion rate of the experimental results is relatively low (less than 40%). To better the photocatalytic activity for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, we explore the follow-up experiments with Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst. It is interesting to note that as the amount of catalyst added increases, the conversion rate gradually increases (Table S4). However, the increase in the conversion rate is not obvious when the amount of the catalyst more than 20 mg, which may be due to the excessive addition amount of the catalyst, resulting in uneven dispersion in the solvent. Therefore, the usage of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 is 20 mg, considering the dispersion performance in the solvent. We gain further insight into the effect of solvent addition on conversion by changing the amount of acetonitrile (Table S5). Considering conversion rate and avoiding wasting solvents, the solvent usage in subsequent experiments is 4 mL. As shown in Fig. S7, the slope of the curve is correspond to the reaction rate. Obviously, as the reaction time prolongs, the reaction rate of benzyl alcohol gradually decrease. The reaction rate is almost reduced to zero while the reaction time reach 240 min and the conversion rate reach 92% (outperforms most of other previous reported TiO2-based materials, as shown in Table S6). Therefore, the reaction time of the subsequent experiments are set to 240 min (4 h). The four as-prepared Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts, TiO2 and P25 are tested by photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under the optimal experimental conditions explored above. As shown in Table 1 , the conversion rates of the four Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts are higher than those of TiO2 and P25, which prove that Ti3C2 can significantly improve the photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst. Interestingly, the specific surface areas of the four photocatalysts are similar (Fig. 5 a), but the catalytic performance of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst is the best (the value of the conversion is 92%), which means that the content of Ti3C2 plays a key role in Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts (16.99% Ti3C2 in Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst from Table S2). We speculate that a high content of Ti3C2 (>16.99%) may hinder the utilization of visible light, which will result in a decrease of photocatalytic efficiency. We also find that the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 is better than that of P25, which speculates that the nanowire-like structure of TiO2 owns a better catalytic performance. As we all know, the photocurrent is mainly determined by the efficiency of the separation of e− and h+. A higher photocurrent leads to a better separation efficiency of the e− and h+. The current-potential curves of the four as-prepared Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts, TiO2 and P25 are tested to further explore the recombination probablity of photogenerated carriers (Fig. 5b). It can be clearly seen that the increased photocurrent of Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts are considerably higher than that of TiO2 and P25. The order of photocurrent density correlated with its photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photocurrent of Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts implies the enhanced separation of e− and h+, thus efficiently improving the photocatalytic performance. As shown in Fig. S8, the transient photocurrent of the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts, TiO2 and P25 are consistent with the current-potential curves. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots are carried out in a frequency range from 10−2 Hz to 105 Hz under visible light illumination. As shown in Fig. 5c, the Nyquist plots of the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts display a smaller diameter than that of TiO2 and P25, indicating a lower electronic resistance of the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts. These results illustrate that the introduction of Ti3C2 significantly enhanced the electron mobility of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst exhibits the smallest diameter in all the samples, corresponding with the results of transient photocurrent responses. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) is carried out to reveal the electronic band structure and optical properties [55]. As shown in Fig. 5d, the light absorption of Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts above 400 nm reduces with the increase of H2O2, which means an increase in the content of TiO2. Although the light absorption of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.3 photocatalyst is the best, its photocatalytic effect is relatively poor. Since the color of Ti3C2 is black, it is helpful to improve the light absorption performance of the composites when the content of Ti3C2 is high. However, the Ti3C2 is inclined to convert the light energy into heat energy, which leads to a decrease in the photocatalytic efficiency. This phenomenon has been reported in related literatures [44,45]. Therefore, a suitable Ti3C2 content is crucial. Fig. 5e shows that the band gap energy of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst and TiO2 are 2.40 and 3.04 eV, respectively, which are calculated based on the Oregan and Gratzel method. Significantly, the introduction of Ti3C2 contribute to narrow the band gap of the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts and facilitate optical absorption. In order to verify that Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts absorb visible light and have a certain light response, we have recorded photocurrent action spectra, as shown in Fig. S9. We can see that Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 exhibits a weak photocurrent response when equipped with a 500 nm cut off filter (λ > 500 nm). However, there is no photocurrent response when equipped with a 520 nm cut off filter. These results are closely associated to the bandgap of 2.4 eV and the photocurrent response is remarkably enhanced with the decrease in the excitation wavelengths. Actually, it is the formation of the heterojunctions between TiO2 and Ti3C2 narrowing the bandgap of TiO2 rather than Ti3C2 simply narrowing the bandgap of TiO2, which is consistent with the previous references [44,45]. The recombination rate of e− and h+ has been further investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectra. Generally, the stronger intensity of PL emission means a higher recombination rate of photogenerated carriers [56]. Fig. 5f exhibits the PL spectra of Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts and TiO2 under the excitation wavelength of 365 nm. For the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts, the PL emission intensity is lower than that of TiO2, suggesting that the introduction of Ti3C2 contributes to retarding the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes due to the Ti3C2 as e− traps. Moreover, Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst has the lowest intensity, indicating that it could efficiently promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, which is well consistent with the transient photocurrent responses and the photocatalytic oxidation performance results. In order to investigate the general applicability of the Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols, the substrate scope has been extended under similar reaction conditions and the results are summarized in Table 2 . Remarkably, the chemical activity of the substrates depends on the electron-donating groups or electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic rings. The electron-donating substituents (OCH3 and CH3) improve the conversion (95% and 98%) of the aromatic alcohols. Conversely, the electron-withdrawing substituents (F, Cl and Br) retard that (63%, 71% and 84%). The above experimental results match well with the literature reported previously [57,58]."
11,Recyclability and stability of the catalyst,"3.3 Recyclability and stability of the catalyst To illustrate the reusability of the Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, a five-cycle experiments have been carried out. Each repeated reaction cycle under the same condition and the catalyst is centrifugalized and washed with water and ethanol three times, then the photocatalyst is dried at 60 °C for 12 h and reused for the next run. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the cyclic experimental results indicate that the conversion rates are still maintained at around 90% and the selectivity of benzaldehyde at the level of 99%. Meanwhile, the XRD results show that there is no significant change of the Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst after the reaction (Fig. 6b). The corresponding morphology characterizations of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 after 5 cycles indeed confirm the stability (Fig. S11). After 5 cycles reaction, the morphology of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 remains stable. These results indicate that it has good recyclability and stability during the photocatalytic oxidation process."
12,Action spectrum for the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol on Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7,"3.4 Action spectrum for the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol on Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 Action spectrum has been conducted in order to conclude that Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 certainly absorb the visible light and the absorbed photons contributed to photocatalytic reaction. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is defined in the following equation: A Q E = a m o u n t o f p r o d u c t f o r m e d ( a m o u n t o f p h o t o n s a b s o r b e d ) × 100 % As can be seen in Fig. 7 a, the AQE of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 shows a good overlap between the absorbance spectrum and the apparent quantum efficiencies at different illumination wavelength. It is observed that the photo-response is extended toward 520 nm and the AQE are estimated to be 0.26% under photo-irradiation at 400 ± 5 nm, 0.23% at 420 ± 5 nm, 0.17% at 460 ± 5 nm, 0.09% at 500 ± 5 nm, 0.02% at 520 ± 5 nm and 0% at 550 ± 5 nm. Conclusively, the above experimental results indicate the participation of charge carriers generated in Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 under visible light irradiation in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Also, we have provided the action spectra of Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts and TiO2. As illustrated in Fig. S12 c, Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 exhibits the highest AQE at different incident wavelength. Furthermore, the AQE of Ti3C2/TiO2-0.3 is estimated to be 0 under photo-irradiation at 520 ± 5 nm (Fig. S12 a), which implies that a high content of Ti3C2 may hinder the utilization of visible light. Moreover, the AQE of TiO2 can only be detected about 0.02% at 400 ± 5 nm (Fig. S12 e). Therefore, we find that a suitable content of Ti3C2 is crucial to maximize the photocatalytic performance of the material."
13,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.5 Photocatalytic mechanism To understand the reaction mechanism for photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol over the Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst, a series of controlled experiments with different radical scavengers have been carried out (Fig. 7b). That is, p-benzoquinone (BQ), triethanolamine (TEOA), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) are introduced as quenchers of superoxide radicals ( O2–), photogenerated holes (h+), photogenerated electrons (e−) and hydroxyl radicals ( OH), respectively [22,59]. When BQ is introduced in the reaction system, the conversion of benzyl alcohol reduce apparently, indicating that O2– is an important active species in the reaction system. Similarly, when TEOA is added into the reaction system, resulting in a decrease of the conversion of benzyl alcohol, suggesting that h+ also plays a key role in the photocatalytic oxidation process. However, the yield of benzaldehyde is almost the same with the blank when IPA and CCl4 are added, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde by Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalyst is primarily triggered by O2– and h+. The position of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) plays a crucial role in the separation of photogenerated carriers and transfer direction. The Mott-Schottky of TiO2 and Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst are conducted to study their electronic band structure (Fig. 7c). It is worth noting that both Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 and TiO2 are confirmed as a n-type semiconductor due to the slope of linear 1/C2 potential curve are positive [60,61]. The flat band potential of TiO2 and Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 are −0.62 V vs SCE (−0.38 V vs NHE) and −0.50 V vs SCE (−0.26 V vs NHE). It is known that the bottom of the conduction bands is more negative by ~0.1 V than the flat band potential for n-type semiconductors [62,63]. As Fig. 7c shown, the ECB values of TiO2 and Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 are calculated to be −0.72 V vs SCE (−0.48 V vs NHE) and −0.60 V vs SCE (−0.36 V vs NHE), respectively. Based on the formula EVB = ECB + Eg [64], the EVB values of TiO2 and Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 are about 2.57 and 2.04 V vs NHE, respectively. We speculate that the formation of the heterojunctions between TiO2 and Ti3C2 may narrow the bandgap of TiO2 by shift the valence band and conduction band of TiO2, which is consistent with the previous references [44,45]. On the basis of the above results, we tentatively propose a reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic selective oxidation process of benzyl alcohol over Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalyst. Fig. 7d presents the positions of CB and VB of TiO2 and Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 as well as the redox potentials of O2/ O2 – and BA/BAD (benzyl alcohol/benzaldehyde) [65]. We can find that the introduction of Ti3C2 regulates the position of CB and VB of TiO2, which make Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 an attractive visible light active photocatalyst for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Ti3C2 is considered as metallic material because it owns a very narrow band gap and high carrier mobility. As Scheme 2 shown, under visible-light irradiation, the TiO2 nanowires are excited to produce e− and h+. Due to the outstanding metallic properties of Ti3C2, e− on the CB of TiO2 nanowires can rapidly migrate to Ti3C2, leaving h+ on the VB of TiO2 nanowires. The CB and VB of TiO2 nanowires are bent “upward” when e− accumulated in Ti3C2 and h+ accumulated in TiO2 nanowires respectively, contributing to establish a Schottky barrier through their interfaces, which will prevent e− from transferring back to the TiO2 nanowires, promoting the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which has been revealed by photoluminescence (PL). According to the above interpretation, the enriched e− on Ti3C2 may react with the dissolved oxygen to produce superoxide radical anions ( O2–). Meanwhile, the enriched h+ on TiO2 may react with the absorbed benzyl alcohol to generate the corresponding cation radical. Subsequently, the O2– react with the benzyl alcohol cation radical to generate benzaldehyde. Futhermore, the final product has been further detected by iodometric titration. We speculate that the oxygen is finally reduced to water instead of H2O2 because there is no color change in the test solution, which may also give a reasonable explanation of the high selectivity (Fig. S15). The concentration of H2O2 is below the detection limit of the current method. These results strongly imply that oxygen is final reduced to water."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, the Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalysts had been successfully synthesized via an accessible hydrothermal method and mild chemical process. The obtained photocatalysts showed excellent photoactivity and selectivity for the oxidation of aromatic alcohols with molecular oxygen under visible light. The introduction of Ti3C2 not only contributed to the enhancement of optical absorption but also improved the electrical conductivity of the material, which were conducive to improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and a longer lifetime of the photogenerated carriers. Meanwhile, the Ti3C2/TiO2-0.7 photocatalyst exhibited good recyclability and applicability under visible-light irradiation. Furthermore, the feasible reaction mechanism of Ti3C2/TiO2 photocatalyst under visible light had been proposed. This study had provided a promising way to design efficient visible-light-driven phototcatalyst for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes under mild reaction conditions."
