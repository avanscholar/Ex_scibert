0,Introduction,"Concerns related to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, as well as environmental and public health problems caused by automotive and power regeneration sources make hydrogen, in combination with fuel cells, an attractive alternative energy source. Fuel cells, which operate primarily on hydrogen, offer high efficiency of energy conversion, as well as “clean energy”. There are many well established processes for hydrogen production from fossil fuels such as naphtha, natural gas and coal. These processes, however, result in emission of large quantities of greenhouse gases. For this reason, renewable sources, such as biomass, may be used as alternative feedstocks for hydrogen production. Recently, processes based on biomass gasification [1,2], and reformation of bio-fuels, such as bio-ethanol and bio-gas were suggested [3–7]. Renewable lignocellulosic biomass can be used as an alternative feedstock for hydrogen production. Two possible technologies that have been explored in recent years are steam gasification [8,9] and catalytic steam reforming of pyrolysis oil [10–17]. The latter route involves pyrolysis of biomass to generate bio-oil, and reformation of it to produce a gaseous stream rich in hydrogen. Fast pyrolysis is a process in which biomass is rapidly heated to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. As a result, it decomposes to generate vapors, aerosols and charcoal. It has been shown that maximum liquid yields are obtained at short residence times, about 0.5–1s, and at temperatures around 500 ∘ C [18]. New developments in fast pyrolysis techniques make possible oil yields of 75–80% by weight of anhydrous biomass [19]. The composition of bio-oil varies significantly with the type of biomass and the conditions of pyrolysis. However, elemental analysis of bio-oil derived from different processes shows that its main components include the following groups: acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, sugars and phenols. A number of studies concerning reformation of bio-oil or its components to produce hydrogen have been reported recently [10–17]. Steam reforming of bio-oil presents significant difficulties; the most important is carbon accumulation over the catalytic surface, as in most reforming processes, resulting in gradual deactivation of the catalyst [20,21]. Design of efficient catalysts requires the use of model oxygenate components for preliminary tests. Acetic acid (HAc) is one of the major components of bio-oil (up to 12%) [22–24] and, for this reason, it is used in this study as a model compound for performance tests of various catalysts. Steam reforming of acetic acid and the water gas shift reaction occur simultaneously in the reactor, and the overall stoichiometry is represented by (1) CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 . Steam reforming of HAc is an endothermic reaction ( Δ H = 134.77 kJ / mol at 298K). It is entirely feasible from a thermodynamic point of view and it is favored at high temperatures. An adequate thermodynamic analysis about the reaction of steam reforming of HAc has been recently published [25]. In the present study, a variety of catalysts were tested under conditions of steam reforming of HAc. Supported noble metal catalysts, such as Pt, Pd, and Rh supported on Al 2 O 3 carrier, as well as Ni-based and Ru-based catalysts, were tested with respect to their catalytic activity and stability under conditions of HAc steam reforming. Aim of this work is the development of efficient and stable catalysts for the reaction of steam reforming of acetic acid and, eventually, for the reaction of steam reforming of bio-oil."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The carriers used in the preparation of catalysts were commercial oxides such as γ - Al 2 O 3 (Engelhard or Alfa Products) and La 2 O 3 (Alfa Products). The La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 and MgO / Al 2 O 3 supports were synthesized by impregnating γ - Al 2 O 3 (Engelhard) with La ( NO 3 ) 3 or Mg ( NO 3 ) 2 (Alfa Products), respectively. A known amount of the nitrate precursor was dissolved in water and γ - Al 2 O 3 was added to the solution under continuous stirring. The slurry was heated slowly to 90 ∘ C and maintained at that temperature until nearly all the water evaporated. The solid residue was dried at 110 ∘ C overnight and then calcined in air at 900 ∘ C for 16h. The La 2 O 3 and MgO content of the carrier was 15% by mass. The CeO 2 / Al 2 O 3 carrier was synthesized by mechanically mixing 30% CeO 2 and 70% Al 2 O 3 (both Alfa Products), followed by calcination at 500 ∘ C . The Ni, Pt, Rh, Ru and Pd supported catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method using Ni ( NO ) 2 , ( NH 3 ) 2 Pt ( NO 2 ) 2 , Rh ( NO 3 ) 3 , Ru ( NO ) ( NO 3 ) 3 , and ( NH 3 ) 2 Pd ( NO 2 ) 2 , respectively, as metal precursors. The solid residue was dried at 110 ∘ C overnight and then the dried residue was ground and sieved. The catalyst samples were reduced under H 2 flow at 300 ∘ C for 2h in the case of Rh and Pt catalysts, at 400 ∘ C for 2h for Ru and Pd catalysts and at 500 ∘ C for 5h for Ni catalysts. Complete decomposition of nickel nitrate was achieved [5]. The nominal metal loading for these catalysts was 0.5% for Rh catalyst, 1% for Pd and Pt catalysts, 1% and 5% for Ru catalysts and 17% for Ni catalysts. The specific metal loading was selected based on expected catalytic activity and on previous experience with similar reactions."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Specific surface areas of supports and catalysts were measured with the BET technique using a Micromeritics Gemini III 2375 analyzer, employing nitrogen physisorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. Prior to each measurement, the sample was dried at 120 ∘ C under helium flow. Metal dispersion of fresh catalysts was determined by hydrogen chemisorption employing a modified Fisons Instruments (Sorptomatic 1900) apparatus. Prior to each measurement, the catalyst sample (ca 1.0g) was pretreated by (a) dynamic vacuum at 250 ∘ C for 1h; (b) reduction with 1bar of H 2 at 250 ∘ C for 1h; (c) evacuation for 30min at 250 ∘ C ; and (d) cooling to the chemisorption temperature. Hydrogen uptake at monolayer coverage of the metal particles was obtained by extrapolation of the linear portion of the adsorption isotherm to zero pressure. The exposed surface area was calculated assuming an H: metal stoichiometry of 1:1. Crystallite size of the dispersed metals was estimated from H 2 chemisorption data, assuming spherical particles, using the relation, d M = 6 ρ M S M , where d M is the mean crystallite diameter, S M is the surface area per gram of metal and ρ M is the density of metal."
4,Apparatus and experimental procedure,"2.3 Apparatus and experimental procedure Catalytic performance tests under steady-state conditions were carried out using an apparatus which consists of a flow system, the reactor unit and the analysis system. The flow system was equipped with four mass flow controllers (MKS) providing accurate control of the flows of gaseous streams, while control of liquid feed was achieved by use of an HPLC pump (Marathon, Scientific Systems). The liquid feed consists of acetic acid/water mixture of known composition. This mixture was pumped to an evaporator where the reagents were heated to ca. 190 ∘ C to vaporize, and then mixed with the gas stream. The resulting gas mixture was fed to the reactor through stainless steel tubing, which was heated at 160 ∘ C by means of heating tapes. The continuous flow micro-reactor consists of two 6.0mm o.d. sections of quartz tube, which serve as inlet and outlet to and from a quartz cell of 8.0mm o.d. The catalyst was placed in the cell and kept in place by means of quartz wool. The temperature of the catalyst was measured by a K-type thermowell which ran through the bed. Heating of the reactor was provided by an electrical furnace. The reactor effluent was analyzed using two gas chromatographs (Shimadzu, GC 14A and GC-8B) and a Mass Spectrometer (Balzers, OmniStar GSD 300) connected in parallel through a common set of switch valves. The first GC was equipped with two packed columns (Porapak, Carbosieve) and two detectors (TCD, FID) and used He as carrier gas. Porapak was used for the separation of CH 3 COOH , H 2 O , ( CH 3 ) 2 CO , CH 4 , C 2 H 4 and C 3 H 6 , while Carbosieve was used for the separation of CO, CO 2 and CH 4 . Since the presence of large amounts of water hinders analysis in the Carbosieve column, a condenser was placed before its inlet. The second gas chromatograph, which was connected at the exit of the condenser, was equipped with a Carbosieve column and a TCD detector. This chromatograph uses N 2 as the carrier gas and was solely used for the determination of H 2 concentration in the reformate gas. Determination of the response factors for TCD and FID detectors was achieved with the use of gas streams of known compositions (e.g. Scott specialty mixtures and self-prepared mixtures). The experimental procedure was as follows: prior to any experimentation, the catalyst samples were reduced in situ under H 2 flow (40cc/min) at 400 ∘ C for the Pt, Rh and Pd catalysts, at 550 ∘ C for the Ru catalysts and at 700 ∘ C for the Ni catalysts, for approximately 2h. After purging with He for 15min, the sample was exposed to a mixture consisting of 7.5% CH 3 COOH and 22.5% H 2 O in He, of total flow of 290cc/min, at the temperature of 750 ∘ C . The reaction temperature was kept constant at 750 ∘ C for 4h and acetic acid conversion as well as selectivity toward products was measured. The reactant mixture was substituted with helium flow for 1h in order to remove the remaining gases. The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface during the 4-h reaction was estimated by exposing the catalyst to a 1% O 2 / He mixture at 750 ∘ C and monitoring the quantities of CO and CO 2 produced by mass spectrometer. After this treatment, the catalyst was reduced under H 2 flow at 750 ∘ C for 2h. Catalyst performance experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 550– 800 ∘ C in a descending order. In each temperature the reaction was carried out for 2h, time which was sufficient to achieve steady-state conditions. This procedure was followed in order to estimate the rate of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, as well as catalyst performance as a function of reaction temperature, under conditions of steam reforming of HAc."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization BET surface areas of fresh materials are presented in Table 1 . It is observed that the surface area of Al 2 O 3 is reduced upon addition of La 2 O 3 or MgO. In the case of catalysts with metal loading of 0.5% or 1% their surface area is essentially equal to that of the support. Metal dispersions of the catalysts are also shown in Table 1. As expected, the larger the amount of metal loading, the lower the metal dispersion is. For example, Ni dispersion on the 17% Ni / Al 2 O 3 catalyst is 2.3, while Rh dispersion on the 0.5% Rh / Al 2 O 3 catalyst is 61.5%. The mean crystallite size of the metal particles of each catalyst is also shown in Table 1, estimated as described in the experimental section."
7,Homogeneous reactions and activity of carriers under conditions of steam reforming of HAc,"3.2 Homogeneous reactions and activity of carriers under conditions of steam reforming of HAc Homogeneous reforming reactions may be significant at high temperatures. The importance of homogeneous reactions was investigated in the present study and the results are shown in Fig. 1 A. Homogeneous activity becomes significant at temperatures above 800 ∘ C , in which temperature conversion of HAc is approximately 10%. Thermal decomposition reactions leading primarily to carbon oxides and methane take place over the entire temperature range investigated, while hydrogen production is observed at temperatures higher than 850 ∘ C . As expected, conversion of acetic acid and selectivity toward H 2 increase with increasing temperature. Selectivity towards CO production is favored at high temperatures, in contrast with that of CO 2 , indicating that CO and CO 2 concentrations follow the limitations of the WGS reaction. However, hydrogen selectivity increases at elevated temperature, which is contradictory with the previous statement. This implies that decomposition and/or reforming reactions of acetic acid, resulting in hydrogen formation (as described below), are also taking place over this temperature range. It is apparent that homogeneous reactions are significant only at elevated temperatures. Under the same conditions, steady-state experiments were conducted in the presence of two commercial carriers, γ - Al 2 O 3 (Engelhard) and La 2 O 3 . The results are shown in Fig. 1B and C, respectively. In the case of the alumina carrier (Fig. 1B) no hydrogen evolution is observed at any temperature. The activity of the carrier seems to be significant at temperatures above 800 ∘ C , while HAc is not fully reacted even at as high temperatures as 950 ∘ C . As expected, conversion of HAc increases with increasing reaction temperature and the main products observed are CH 4 , CO 2 , CO and C 2 H 4 mainly due to decomposition reactions of HAc. Carbon dioxide and methane are the two dominant products which follow identical trends, a fact which implies that they may be produced according to the decomposition reaction: (2) CH 3 COOH → CH 4 + CO 2 . Acetone is observed at low temperatures and low HAc conversion, and seems to be produced via the ketonization reaction: (3) 2 CH 3 COOH → ( CH 3 ) 2 CO + H 2 O + CO 2 . Carbon monoxide is detected at temperatures above 850 ∘ C and its concentration increases with temperature. A possible route for CO production is via the ketene ( CH 2 CO ) intermediate and its further reaction, according to the following stoichiometrics: (4) CH 3 COOH → CH 2 CO + H 2 O , (5) 2 CH 2 CO → C 2 H 4 + 2 CO . This route also explains the presence of ethylene, within the same temperature range, in amounts about half of these of CO. Small quantities of CO may also be produced via the reverse water gas shift reaction: (6) CO 2 + H 2 → CO + H 2 O . In the presence of La 2 O 3 carrier (Fig. 1C), activity seems to be somewhat higher as compared to that in the presence of Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1B), but still lower than homogeneous activity (Fig. 1A). In this case, production of hydrogen was observed at temperatures above 900 ∘ C . Except for H 2 , the main products are CO 2 , CO, CH 4 and C 3 H 6 O according to reactions (1)–(3). However, the absence of C 2 H 4 indicates that CO is not produced via reaction (5), but in most probability, due to the following reaction: (7) CH 3 COOH → 2 CO + 2 H 2 as the presence of hydrogen implies. Similar to the case over the Al 2 O 3 carrier, methane and carbon dioxide follow similar trends, although the concentration of CO 2 is higher than that of CH 4 . At low temperatures, the higher CO 2 concentration may be due to the ketonization reaction (Eq. (3)), while at higher temperatures because of the occurrence of the steam reforming reaction (Eq. (1)), as the production of H 2 is indicating. In the case of La 2 O 3 , CO concentration seems to be somewhat higher at elevated temperatures, compared to Al 2 O 3 . Also, selectivity towards acetone production at temperatures below 800 ∘ C is higher, a fact which is in agreement with the literature and previous observations [26]. This may be due to the fact that basic oxides, such as La 2 O 3 , are generally more active than acidic oxides for the ketonization reaction [26,27]. It seems that various reactions can take place under conditions of steam reforming of HAc over both carriers. However, their activity is significant only at elevated temperatures ( > 850 ∘ C ). Decomposition reactions of HAc take place in the temperature range of 750– 950 ∘ C , producing primarily methane and carbon oxides. The ketonization reaction also occurs at temperatures lower than 800 ∘ C , especially in the case of lanthana, which, as a basic oxide, is generally more active toward this reaction. However, in the presence of alumina, ethylene and trace amounts of ethane were also detected in the products at temperatures above 850 ∘ C . This is due to the acidic sites of Al 2 O 3 , which promote decomposition reactions more than the basic sites of La 2 O 3 . This ability of Al 2 O 3 to break the carbon–carbon bond may be the reason why no production of hydrogen was observed, i.e. the steam reforming reaction is not promoted, in contrast to La 2 O 3 at temperatures higher than 900 ∘ C . It is also observed that activity is reduced in the order: homogeneous > lanthana > alumina . This implies that activity is increased with respect to the inverse order of the available surface area in the reactor (see Table 1), indicating that La 2 O 3 and especially Al 2 O 3 act as “quenchers” for some reactions. A close comparison among Fig. 1A–C can lead to the conclusion that carriers may act as “quenchers” for reaction (7), resulting in reduction of the overall activity. This observation can also explain the absence of hydrogen in the product stream over the Al 2 O 3 carrier, as well as the lower H 2 and CO selectivities over the La 2 O 3 carrier, as compared to the homogeneous case."
8,Supported metal catalysts,"3.3 Supported metal catalysts The catalytic performance of a variety of supported metal catalysts was also examined under conditions of steam reforming of HAc. The metallic phase of the catalysts was comprised of noble metals, such as Rh, Pd, and Pt, or of base metals like Ru and Ni. Results of catalytic activity measurements as a function of reaction temperature for the following catalysts: 0.5% Rh / Al 2 O 3 , 1% Pt / Al 2 O 3 , 1% Pd / Al 2 O 3 , 1% Ru / Al 2 O 3 and 17% Ni / Al 2 O 3 , are shown in Fig. 2 A. For comparison, corresponding results obtained in the absence of catalyst (homogeneous reactions) are also shown. In most cases, there is a significant increase of HAc conversion, compared to the homogeneous case. It must be noted, however, that in the presence of catalysts, the reactions which are taking place in gas phase (homogeneously) may occur in a somewhat larger extent (than in the absence), because homogeneous reactions could be triggered by radical species formed on the catalyst surface. The catalytic performance of Pt and Pd is more or less similar, with poor activity even at temperatures as high as 850 ∘ C . HAc conversion for these two catalysts is almost zero at temperatures below 700 ∘ C . Over Ru catalyst, although the conversion of HAc is 100% at 850°C, a drastic drop of conversion is observed at lower temperatures. The Rh catalyst, although it contains half of the mass of noble metal of the other catalysts, shows very high activity. However, the highest activity is exhibited by the Ni catalyst, probably due to its very large metal content. The rank of the catalysts based on their activity seems to be the following: 1% Pt / Al 2 O 3 < 1 % Pd / Al 2 O 3 < 1 % Ru / Al 2 O 3 < 0.5 % Rh / Al 2 O 3 < 17 % Ni / Al 2 O 3 . A better means of comparing catalytic activity of different catalysts is turnover frequency, which is activity expressed per exposed metal atom. Turnover frequencies of HAc conversion were determined from experiments in which HAc conversion was maintained below 15%, taking into account the dispersion of the catalysts as estimated by selective chemisorption of H 2 (Table 1). Results are summarized in the Arrhenius-type diagram of Fig. 2B, where the TOFs of the catalysts examined are plotted as functions of the inverse reaction temperature. As it can be observed from Fig. 2B, catalytic activity depends appreciably on the nature of the dispersed metallic phase. Ni exhibits the higher intrinsic activity per exposed atom among all catalysts investigated, while Pt the lowest. Thus, the superior performance of the Ni / Al 2 O 3 catalyst is not only due to the large metal loading but also due to the enhanced intrinsic activity of Ni. The apparent activation energy ( E a ) of the reaction of steam reforming of HAc, which can be estimated from the slopes of the fitted lines, seems to vary among the different catalysts. The values of E a of each catalyst are shown in Table 2 , and their range (25.4–37.6kcal/mol) is typical for steam reforming reactions [28,29]. While Pd, Ni and Rh have similar activation energy, Pt and Ru catalysts exhibit higher E a . It seems that the influence of the dispersed metallic phase is rather weak, indicating that the reaction which dominatingly contributes to the value of E a is not affected strongly by the nature of the metal. This is expected due to the fact that the reactions which take place at such conditions ( X HAc < 10 % ) , mainly decomposition reactions, are the most rapid ones and are occurring mainly on the carrier surface. It must be noted that under these conditions the main products which are present in gas phase are H 2 , CO and CO 2 . Selectivity towards hydrogen production as a function of reaction temperature over the same catalysts is shown in Fig. 3 . The rank of catalysts, based on hydrogen selectivity, is the same as that based on overall catalytic activity. At temperatures above 750 ∘ C , selectivity of all catalysts toward hydrogen production is very high. This may imply that reformation of intermediates requires higher temperatures and it is effectively achieved in this temperature range. At lower temperatures, however, hydrogen selectivity is drastically lower implying that other reaction routes dominate which produce relatively stable intermediates. No hydrogen is observed at temperatures below 700 ∘ C for the Ru, Pd and Pt catalysts. In contrast, the Ni catalyst offers high selectivity toward hydrogen production at temperatures as low as 600°C, while hydrogen selectivity is almost 100% in the temperature range of 700–850°C. This is due to the very high metal loading of the Ni catalyst (17%), and the high inherent activity of Ni, (TOF), which offer very high overall activity in the reactor so as to complete all reactions and lead to the final product which is H 2 . Selectivities of main by-products for each catalyst at the temperature of 650 ∘ C are presented in Fig. 4 , in order to elucidate which of the side-reactions are promoted by each metal. Of course, at high temperatures, steam reforming reactions are the dominant reactions for all catalysts, and, as a result, no or very little amounts of by-products were observed. For this reason, product selectivities at the low temperature of 650 ∘ C , where the amounts of by-products are significant, are shown in Fig. 4. At this temperature, the main by-products which were observed are CO, CO 2 , C 3 H 6 O and CH 4 . This implies that the side-reactions which take place along with the steam reforming reaction are reactions (2), (3), (6) and (7). Methane can also be produced via the methanation reactions: (8) CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O , (9) CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O . It is apparent from Fig. 4A that acetone is present in large amounts over the Rh catalyst, indicating that this catalyst promotes the ketonization reaction (Eq. (3)), more than all the other catalysts tested. Furthermore, the lowest CO 2 selectivity and the highest CO selectivity are observed over the Rh catalyst (Fig. 4C and D), implying that the reverse WGS reaction occurs at high rates. On the other hand, the Pt catalyst exhibited the highest CO 2 and the lowest CO production (Fig. 4C and D), a fact which implies that Pt promotes the WGS reaction. Of course, Pt catalysts are known for their enhanced activity in the WGS reaction, while Rh catalysts are not so active [30]. The highest selectivity toward methane production was observed over the Pd catalyst (Fig. 4B). This may be due to the promoting of reactions (2), (8) and (9). Finally, the lowest amount of by-products was observed in the case of Ni catalyst. Carbon oxides are the main products, while methane and acetone are present only in small amounts ( S < 3 % ) ."
9,Supported Ni catalysts,"3.4 Supported Ni catalysts From the results presented earlier (Fig. 2) it is concluded that the Ni / Al 2 O 3 catalyst is the most active one, among all catalysts investigated. However, it is known that for this type of reactions the nature of the carrier plays an important role in defining catalytic performance, because the carrier may affect selectivity of the final products [31], or it may also contribute to the stabilization of the metal particles at high temperatures in presence of steam [32]. Also, it has been shown that the rate of carbon deposition on catalyst surfaces is reduced when the metal is supported on a basic carrier, such as La 2 O 3 or MgO [4,33] rather than on an acidic carrier. For this reason, the Al 2 O 3 carrier was impregnated with additives, such as La 2 O 3 and MgO in order to alter its surface acidity/basicity characteristics. Thus, Ni catalysts supported on 15% La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 and 15% MgO / Al 2 O 3 carriers were also tested under conditions of HAc steam reforming, and their catalytic performance is compared to that of Ni / Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The conversion of HAc as a function of reaction temperature for the three Ni catalysts is shown in Fig. 5 A. The activities of 17% Ni / Al 2 O 3 and Ni / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 catalysts are similar. Over these catalysts, the conversion of HAc is 100% at high temperatures, and it is reduced as temperature is reduced, to reach the level of 30–40% at temperatures less than 650°C. On the other hand, over the Ni / MgO / Al 2 O 3 catalyst conversion of HAc remains quantitative over the entire temperature range, even for temperatures as low as 650°C. Turnover frequencies of converted HAc were also determined for the three nickel catalysts, and the results are shown in the Arrhenius-type diagram of Fig. 5B. The results are more or less similar with those of Fig. 5A. Ni / Al 2 O 3 and Ni / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 catalysts present similar activity, while the Ni / MgO / Al 2 O 3 catalyst seems to be much more active than the former ones. The values of the apparent activation energies for each catalyst were estimated and are presented in Table 2. It is obvious that the Ni / MgO / Al 2 O 3 catalyst exhibits the lowest activation energy, while the other two catalysts have similar E a . However, the range of the values of E a is relatively narrow (20.8–25.4kcal/mol), indicating that the effect of the support is not significant. This may be due to the fact that the rate-limiting reactions take place at the nickel surface, because of its very large loading (17%). The formation of hydrogen as well as other by-products as a function of reaction temperature was also determined under conditions of steam reforming of HAc over the three nickel catalysts (not shown). At temperatures higher than 700 ∘ C hydrogen selectivity is almost 100% for all catalysts, which means that steam reforming of HAc is the dominant reaction and no hydrogen-containing by-products are evolving. At lower temperatures selectivity towards hydrogen production is reduced due to the formation of hydrogen-containing by-products such as acetone and methane. This reduction is slower in the case of Ni/ Al 2 O 3 and Ni / MgO / Al 2 O 3 catalysts, over which small amounts of by-products were observed ( S C 3 H 6 O , S CH 4 < 3 % ) . In the case of Ni / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 acetone is produced at high rates at temperatures lower than 630°C ( S C 3 H 6 O ∼ 23 % ) , indicating that the La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 carrier favors the ketonization reaction at low temperatures. Of course, carbon oxides were present in the reformate gas in large amounts, due to reactions (1), (6) and (7). Formation of CO is favored at higher temperatures, in contrast with CO 2 , following the WGS limitations. Generally, all Ni catalysts tested were found to be very active under conditions of HAc steam reforming. At high temperatures, the only products which were observed were CO, CO 2 and H 2 , which implies that the steam reforming of HAc along with the WGS are the two reactions occurring simultaneously in this temperature range ( T > 700 ∘ C ) . At lower temperatures, some by-products such as methane and acetone, were observed due to reactions (2) and (3) along with carbon oxides and hydrogen. These reactions may also occur at elevated temperatures but by-products are not observed because of their further reforming via steam and dry reforming reactions. It is obvious from Fig. 5A and B that addition of La 2 O 3 on Ni / Al 2 O 3 catalyst has only minor effects in its catalytic behavior. However, addition of MgO on Al 2 O 3 resulted in improvement of catalytic activity as well as hydrogen selectivity."
10,Supported Ru catalysts,"3.5 Supported Ru catalysts The influence of the carrier on the catalytic activity of Ru was also investigated by dispersing Ru crystallites on Al 2 O 3 impregnated with MgO, La 2 O 3 and CeO 2 . The mixed carriers (15% MgO / Al 2 O 3 , 15% La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 , 30% CeO 2 / Al 2 O 3 ) were prepared following the procedure described earlier. In all cases the metal loading of the catalysts was 5%. Catalytic activity of the four Ru catalysts is shown in Fig. 6 A in which conversion of HAc is shown as a function of reaction temperature. It is apparent that addition of metal oxides on the Al 2 O 3 support resulted in improvement of the performance of the Ru catalysts and shift of HAc conversion curves towards lower temperatures. The rank of the Ru catalysts based on their catalytic activity seems to be the following: 5% Ru / Al 2 O 3 < 5 % Ru / CeO 2 / Al 2 O 3 < 5 % Ru / MgO / Al 2 O 3 ≈ 5 % Ru / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 . It must be noted that in the case of the last two catalysts, the conversion of HAc remained complete at temperatures above 700 ∘ C . Kinetic experiments for the determination of turnover frequencies were also conducted with the Ru catalysts. The results are shown in the Arrhenius-type diagram of Fig. 6B in which the TOFs of the four ruthenium catalysts are shown as functions of the inverse reaction temperature. As it can be seen, the order of the Ru catalysts is similar with that of Fig. 6A. The 5% Ru / Al 2 O 3 catalyst presents the lowest intrinsic activity, while addition of CeO 2 , MgO and La 2 O 3 resulted in significant improvement of inherent catalytic activity. The Ru / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 catalyst presents the higher activity at lower temperatures, while Ru / MgO / Al 2 O 3 is more active at higher temperatures. It seems that catalytic activity depends noticeably on the nature of the carrier, on which the metal is supported, indicating that either significant chemistry is taking place on the carrier itself or that the support may be influencing the inherent catalytic properties of the metal crystallites. Also, the nature of the carrier seems to affect the size of metal crystallites of each catalyst (Table 1). This may be due to the addition of basic oxides on Al 2 O 3 carrier, resulting in alteration of the pH of the carrier, the value of which plays significant role in defining the physicochemical characteristics of the catalyst [34]. The catalysts with smaller metal particles have higher intrinsic activity as compared to the ones with larger ruthenium crystallites. The apparent activation energy ( E a ) of the reaction of steam reforming of HAc is also influenced by the carrier. The values of E a for the different Ru-based catalysts are presented in Table 2. The 5% Ru / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 catalyst has the lowest E a , while the Ru / Al 2 O 3 catalyst the highest. It is obvious that the nature of the carrier strongly affects the value of the apparent activation energy, while, as discussed earlier, the nature of the dispersed metallic phase has a weaker effect. This implies that the dominating contribution to the E a originates from a reaction step associated with the support (e.g. water adsorption/activation) or from a reaction occurring on the support. The latter is also confirmed by the fact that over the Ru / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 catalyst (which exhibits the lowest E a ), in addition to the reforming and WGS reactions, the ketonization reaction, which probably occurs on the support, is also taking place, resulting in significant alteration of E a . Hydrogen selectivity was also determined as a function of reaction temperature and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . Again, it is apparent that the incorporation of additives on the alumina carrier resulted in higher selectivity toward hydrogen production. Hydrogen selectivity is high at temperatures above 700 ∘ C and it is reduced at lower temperatures due to the formation of by-products. It must be noted that high hydrogen selectivity was achieved over the Ru / MgO / Al 2 O 3 catalyst even at temperatures as low as 550 ∘ C . Hydrogen selectivity is related to the formation, or not, of by-products, such as acetone and methane. As expected, at high temperatures such by-products are produced in very small amounts because of the domination of steam reforming reactions, while at lower temperatures they are present in larger quantities (not shown). Methane is the main by-product over the Ru / Al 2 O 3 catalyst, which is present over the entire temperature range at relatively small amounts ( 3 > S CH 4 > 5 % ) . Over the other three ruthenium catalysts, acetone is the most important by-product, while trace amounts of methane were observed ( S CH 4 < 1 % ) . In the case of Ru / CeO 2 / Al 2 O 3 catalyst, acetone is formed at temperature as high as 750 ∘ C as well, while on the Ru / MgO / Al 2 O 3 and Ru / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 case it is produced at temperatures lower than 700 ∘ C . For example, over the latter catalyst, selectivity toward acetone formation at 600°C is approximately 22%. Of course, carbon oxides are also present in the product distribution over the entire temperature range, following the limitations of the WGS reaction."
11,Estimation of the rate of carbon deposition under reaction conditions,"3.6 Estimation of the rate of carbon deposition under reaction conditions Carbon deposition is one of the major problems in catalytic reforming reactions since it leads to rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to poisoning of active sites and pore blockage [35,36]. As was already mentioned in the experimental section, the rate of carbon deposition under conditions of steam reforming of HAc was measured for all catalysts as follows: the reaction was carried out for 4h at 750 ∘ C and the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst was titrated with 1% O 2 in He at 750 ∘ C . The amount of coke deposited was estimated by integration of the CO 2 and CO curves, which were recorded by a Mass Spectrometer connected online. Carbon formation may take place in several ways, the most possible of them are the following: (10) ( i ) via the “Boudouard” reaction: 2 CO ↔ CO 2 + C , (11) ( ii ) via the decomposition reaction: CH 3 COOH → CO 2 + 2 H 2 + C ads , (iii) from decomposition of ethylene which is produced via reactions (4)–(5), or (iv) via oligomers, such as mesityl oxide and ketene, derived from HAc or acetone [16]. Results of all catalysts are summarized in Table 3 in which the percentages (based on total carbon fed into the reactor) of carbon deposited during 4h of reaction at 750 ∘ C are shown. Comparison of the amounts of carbon deposited on Al 2 O 3 and on metal catalysts supported on alumina leads to the conclusion that the presence of metal results in significant reduction of the rate of carbon deposition. This is due to the fact that the presence of metal on alumina favors the reforming reactions and retards decomposition reactions which are mainly responsible for the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalytic surface. Furthermore, the dispersed metal particles promote the coke gasification reactions (reactions between coke and steam or the inverse Boudouard reaction) which lead toward reduced apparent rates of carbon deposition. Increase of metal loading also has positive effect on the rate of carbon deposition, as it can be concluded by comparison of 1% and 5% Ru catalysts supported on Al 2 O 3 carrier (Table 3). Generally, lower amounts of carbon were detected over Ru-based and Ni-based catalysts. It seems that the amount of coke deposited onto the catalytic surface is inversely related to its catalytic activity. Among the catalysts tested, the largest amount of carbon was measured over the Pd / Al 2 O 3 catalyst, which has exhibited the poorest catalytic behavior, and the lowest over the Ni and Ru catalysts supported on MgO / Al 2 O 3 carrier, which are the most active ones. It has been reported [37,38] that the presence of MgO in the support causes prolongation of the induction period during which practically no formation of carbon takes place. Moreover, the presence of magnesium results in enhanced capacity of the catalyst for adsorption of steam and thus coke removal by gasification [12]."
12,Long-term stability tests,"3.7 Long-term stability tests Long-term stability tests were conducted for the most-promising catalysts, i.e. Ni and Ru supported on La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 and MgO / Al 2 O 3 carriers. Helium was removed completely from the feed gas in these experiments, in order to achieve more realistic conditions. The performance of the Ni / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 catalyst with respect to activity and selectivity with time on stream at 800 ∘ C is shown in Fig. 8 A. The HAc conversion fluctuates between 100% and 80%, in a recurring periodic cycle. Each “step” corresponds to a one-day experiment, during which catalyst deactivates rapidly with a constant rate. The catalyst seems to recover most of its activity during the shut-down when it is exposed to He flow at 700°C for 1h before cooling down to room temperature under He flow. This phenomenon may imply that the deactivation is due to the adsorption of one or more species on the catalytic surface, which obstructs the steam reforming reaction. This process seems to be reversible and the adsorbed species desorbs under He flow. Activity recovery under He flow is not complete which may be due to carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. After treatment of the catalyst with 1% O 2 for coke removal, the same phenomenon is repeated. However, in this case, activity recovery is complete. Product distribution is stable during the entire experiment, with H 2 , CO, CO 2 and CH 4 being the main products. Selectivity toward hydrogen production is stable and above 95% for all 100h, while selectivities toward CO 2 and CO are stabilized at about 45% and 52%, respectively. Methane was observed as the only by-product, but in very small concentrations ( S CH 4 < 4 % ) . The corresponding stability test over the Ni / MgO / Al 2 O 3 catalyst with respect to time on stream is shown in Fig. 8B. In this case, HAc conversion is significantly more stable and is maintained at high levels (above 90%). Activity seems to be varying within a narrow range, exhibiting a cyclic behavior. The main products observed during reaction are H 2 , CO 2 , CO and CH 4 . Hydrogen selectivity is maintained at very high levels (above 97%) during the entire experiment. Selectivities towards CO 2 and CO were stabilized at about 52% and 46%, respectively, while CH 4 was present in small amounts ( S CH 4 < 3 % ) . Long-term stability tests were also conducted over the Ru catalysts supported on La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 and MgO / Al 2 O 3 carriers. Results obtained over the 5% Ru/ La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 at the reaction temperature of 800 ∘ C are shown in Fig. 9 A. Conversion of HAc is maintained at high levels (above 90%) for about 50h. However, activity seems to be varying within a narrow range, often exhibiting a cyclic behavior and an overall reduction with time on stream. The reduced activity may be due to carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. Product selectivities are stable during the entire experiment, while CO 2 and CO selectivities are stabilized at 60% and 36%, respectively, and selectivity toward CH 4 production is about 4%. Hydrogen selectivity is above 95% during the entire experiment. The corresponding stability test of the 5% Ru / MgO / Al 2 O 3 catalyst as a function of time on stream is shown in Fig. 9B. This catalyst showed very stable catalytic performance for 35h on stream. As conversion of HAc and selectivity towards hydrogen remained at 100% during this period of time, the total reactant flow rate was increased from 290 to 470cc/min in order to reduce the HAc conversion and record any fluctuation in catalyst performance. The conversion of acetic acid slightly dropped within the next 30h on stream, but remained stable at about 90%, while selectivity towards hydrogen production remained at very high levels, almost 100%. Selectivity towards CO and CO 2 were stabilized at 40% and 60%, respectively, while the only by-product which was detected was methane, but in very small concentrations ( S CH 4 < 2 % ) . The stable performance can be related to the very low carbon deposition rate over this catalyst, as was already discussed (Section 3.6)."
13,Summary and conclusions,"The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of the present study: • Homogeneous reactions can take place at temperatures higher than 850 ∘ C under conditions of steam reforming of HAc, leading primarily to methane and carbon oxides. Such reactions, along with the ketonization reaction, can also take place in the presence of Al 2 O 3 and La 2 O 3 carriers. However, supports seem to act as “quenchers” resulting in reduction of the overall activity, as compared to the homogeneous case. • Catalytic activity for steam reforming of HAc depends appreciably on the nature of the dispersed metallic phase. Ni-, Rh- and Ru-containing catalysts, were found to be the most active ones, while Pt and Pd catalysts exhibited much lower activity. • The nature of the support also plays significant role in the reaction of steam reforming of HAc. Addition of basic oxides, such as La 2 O 3 , CeO 2 and MgO, on Ni and especially Ru catalysts supported on Al 2 O 3 resulted in significant improvement of their catalytic activity. • The apparent activation energy of the reaction is affected weakly by the nature of the dispersed metallic phase, while it depends strongly on the nature of the support. • Carbon deposition is favored over alumina carrier. However, the presence of metal on Al 2 O 3 retards the carbon deposition rate. Also, addition of La 2 O 3 and MgO on Al 2 O 3 results in significant reduction of the rate of carbon deposition. Lower rates of coke deposition were measured over the Ru and Ni catalysts supported on the MgO / Al 2 O 3 carrier. • Ru catalysts exhibited stable performance with respect to time on stream, especially the Ru / MgO / Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Ni catalysts, especially the Ni / La 2 O 3 / Al 2 O 3 catalyst, exhibited a rather unstable behavior."
