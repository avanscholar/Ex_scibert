0,Introduction,"Among numerous routes to maintain the sustainability in global fuel supply, environmental protection, and chemical production, efficient conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals has been regarded as a promising one (McKendry, 2002). Since biomass is substantially composed of cellulose in nature, a great deal of effort has been made in catalytic conversion of cellulose using mineral acids and bases (Camacho et al., 1996; Yin et al., 2011), enzymes (Singh et al., 2009), ionic liquids (Rinaldi et al., 2008), and supercritical water (Saka and Ueno, 1999). However, the above homogeneously catalytic processes for cellulose conversion often suffer from some disadvantages, including difficulty in separation, harsh reaction conditions, high corrosion to equipment, etc. Therefore, much attention is paid to heterogeneous catalytic processes. For instances, Pt/Al2O3 (Fukuoka and Dhepe, 2006), supported Ru clusters (Luo et al., 2007), bimetallic Ni–Pt (Shrotri et al., 2012) and Ni/W/SiO2–Al2O3 (Baek et al., 2012) catalysts were used in conversion of cellulose to chemicals such as sugar alcohols and polyols. Ji et al., 2008 reported that tungsten carbide and metal-tungsten carbide catalysts could convert cellulose to ethylene glycol. However, these noble metal catalysts and metal carbide catalysts are not cost-effective enough. In addition, external H2 gas with a high pressure (5–6MPa) is needed in the above processes, limiting their wide application. Recently, non-noble Cu-doped hydrotalcite catalyst was used to catalyze the conversion of cellulose and woody biomass in supercritical methanol (Matson et al., 2011), and the conversion of lignin via hydrogen transfer from supercritical methanol (Barta et al., 2010). It is well known that CuO-based catalysts can be employed in methanol reforming (Palo et al., 2007), synthesis of methanol (Zhang et al., 2006), and water gas shift reactions (Djinovic et al., 2008), which are related to generation and consumption of H2. Naturally, it may be possible to integrate the hydrogenolysis of biomass with the methanol reforming reaction in a single process by using bi-functional CuO-based catalysts. However, the active sites and the catalytic functions of the CuO-based catalysts in the above two reactions have not been investigated systematically. Herein, the selective conversion of cellulose via hydrogenolysis to C4–C7 alcohols in methanol over CuO-based catalysts is reported. A series of CuO–MO/Al2O3 (M=Ce, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) catalysts were synthesized by simple co-precipitation method. It is found that CuO-based catalysts play dual roles in catalyzing methanol reforming to generate H2 and cellulose conversion reactions, and CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic properties. The major liquid products containing C4–C7 alcohols could be used as fuels and fuel additives for replacement of octane or cetane."
1,Methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All the chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China, and used without further treatment. The CuO–MO/Al2O3 (M=Ce, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) catalysts with a Cu/M/Al molar ratio of 68/23/9 (Sa et al., 2011) were prepared by the conventional co-precipitation method. Briefly, a 200mL aqueous solution containing 16.43g copper nitrate trihydrate (0.068mol), 3.36g aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (0.009mol), metal M nitrate (M=Ce, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn, 0.023mol), and another 300mL aqueous solution of containing 15.9g sodium carbonate (0.150mol) were prepared separately, and they were added simultaneously into 200mL deionized water at 60°C under vigorous stirring. The resulting mixture was maintained at pH 6–7 and aged at 60°C for 2h, followed by filtering and washing with deionized water. The obtained solid was dried at 120°C overnight and calcined at 600°C for 5h in air. For a comparison, a CuO/Al2O3 catalyst with a Cu/Al molar ratio of 68/9 was also prepared by the same method without adding the third metal nitrate."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the samples were obtained with a PRO (PANalytical) diffractometer operated at 40kV and 40mA by using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5418Å). The crystal size was calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation. The elemental analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer Optima 5300 DV inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The microscopic feature of the samples was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEM-6100F, JEOL). Adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured using N2 at −196°C with NOVA 3200e (Quantachrome, USA) nitrogen adsorption apparatus. Before measurement, the sample was degassed at 200°C for 4h under vacuum. The specific surface area was determined according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method in the relative pressure range of 0.05–0.2. Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2–TPR) was carried out on an automated chemisorption analyzer (chem-BET pulsar TPR/TPD, Quantachrome). Prior to the measurement, 0.1g of catalyst placed in a quartz U-tube was pretreated in an Ar stream at 300°C for 1h. Then, the sample was cooled to room temperature, followed by heating to 1000°C at 10°Cmin−1 under a binary gas (10.0vol.% H2/Ar) with a gas flow of 30mLmin−1."
4,Catalyst evaluation,"2.3 Catalyst evaluation In a typical run, 0.5–4.0g cellulose (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China), 0.5g catalyst, and 30mL methanol (Tianjin Xihua Special Type Reagent Factory, China) were put into a 100mL stainless-steel autoclave reactor (Parr Instrument Company). After replacing the air inside the reactor with nitrogen, the reaction was carried out at a given temperature (220–320°C) for certain time (1–240min) keeping stirring at 400rpm. After reaction, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature. The gas products were collected by a gas bag and analyzed by Micro GC (3000A; Agilent Technologies) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The liquid products were separated from the catalyst by filtration and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, Shimadzu) with a 30m×0.25mm, and 0.25μm film thickness RX-5ms column. The compound was determined by the computer software from the characterized GC/MS graphs. The liquid products were classified into five groups over the CuO-based catalysts, namely C4–C7 alcohols, methyl esters, furans, ethers and ketones, and others (alkanes, etc.), and the specific component in the liquid products are listed in Table S1. It is difficult to give precise quantitative analysis of the compounds by GC/MS technique due to the complex products and the lack of available standard method. However, the chromatographic peak area of a compound is considered linear with its quantity and the peak area % is linear with its content. The peak area and peak area % of each product can be employed to compare the relative content among the detected products (Dong et al., 2012; Pattiya et al., 2008). Thus, each group liquid products were analyzed at least three times and the average peak area (%) were calculated for discussion. Cellulose conversion was calculated using the following formulas: (1) cellulose conversion = Mass cellulose ( g ) - Mass residue ( g ) Mass cellulose ( g ) × 100 % where Masscellulose is the mass of cellulose used, and Massresidue is the mass of residual cellulose after reaction (the catalyst in the residue was dissolved in nitric acid). The stability of catalytic activity was tested at 280°C and 120min for four runs. The catalyst after reaction was washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times for next run."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic conversion of cellulose over CuO–MO/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.1 Catalytic conversion of cellulose over CuO–MO/Al2O3 catalysts The conversion of cellulose over the CuO-based catalysts is summarized in Table 1 . The control reaction without catalyst gives a 72% conversion of cellulose without gas products. Among all the examined catalysts, catalysts containing CeO, MgO and ZnO exhibit higher cellulose conversion than CuO/Al2O3 catalysts, whereas the NiO-containing catalyst gives the lowest conversion. The total volume of gas products varies with the catalyst composition and the highest production of gas products is obtained on CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 (see in Table 1). Fig. 1 a shows the distribution of the gas products over the CuO-based catalysts. It can be seen that the distribution of gas products is similar over all the CuO-based catalysts. The gas products mainly contain H2, CO, CO2 and a small amount of CH4, and above 60% is H2, which should be good for the hydrogenolysis of cellulose. Fig. 1b presents the liquid product distribution of cellulose conversion over different CuO-based catalysts. The liquid products are a mixture of many compounds, such as C4–C7 alcohols, methyl esters, furans, ethers and ketones, etc., similar to the products obtained by Kunkes et al. (2008) in conversion of sorbitol and glucose over Pt–Re catalyst. According to the peak area, comparing with the result without adding catalyst (blank in Fig. 1b), the addition of CuO-based catalysts increases the yield of liquid products generally, and the major liquid products are C4–C7 alcohols (Table S2) over the CuO-based catalysts. Additionally, the incorporation of the third metal oxide of CeO, MgO, and ZnO into CuO/Al2O3 can increase the yield of C4–C7 alcohols, while that of NiO promotes the formation of unsaturated and oxygen-containing compounds such as methyl esters. Among these catalysts, CuO-ZnO/Al2O3 exhibits the highest yield of C4–C7 alcohols. Based on the peak area (%) results in Table S2, the relative content of C4–C7 alcohols is 78.9% over CuO/Al2O3 catalyst, and the addition of Ce, Mg, Zn oxides increase the relative content of C4–C7 alcohols (89.1%, 93.0% and 95.3%, respectively), while the addition of Ni oxide decrease the relative content of C4–C7 alcohols (40.9%)."
7,Characterization of the CuO–MO/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of the CuO–MO/Al2O3 catalysts XRD patterns of the CuO-based catalysts before reaction (Fig. S1a) that for all of the fresh catalysts, a group of diffraction peaks at 35.6°, 38.7° and 48.8° are observed, which correspond to (−111), (111) and (−202) planes of CuO (JCPDS 01-089-5896), respectively. Moreover, the typical diffraction peaks of CeO2 (JCPDS 00-043-1002), CuMn2O4 (JCPDS 01-084-0543), NiO (JCPDS 01-089-7390) and ZnO (JCPDS 01-070-2551) also appear in the pattern of CuO–CeO/Al2O3, CuO–MnO2/Al2O3, CuO–NiO/Al2O3, and CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively. The crystal size of CuO was calculated by Scherrer equation and summarized in Table 2 . The CuO crystal sizes in CuO/Al2O3, CuO–CeO/Al2O3 and CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts are about 23nm, while those in CuO–MgO/Al2O3, CuO–MnO2/Al2O3 and CuO–NiO/Al2O3 are larger, ranging from 25 to 36nm. The H2–TPR curves of the CuO-based catalysts in Fig. S1b show that a broad peak is observed in the range of 225–395°C for CuO/Al2O3 catalyst, which can be attributed to the reduction of CuO species. This peak shifts to higher temperatures after the addition of Ce, Mg, Mn, Ni and Zn oxides, probably due to the strong interaction between CuO and the third metal oxides (Zhang et al., 2005). These results indicate that most of CuO–MO/Al2O3 catalyst cannot be reduced completely below 300°C under the TPR test conditions. The XRD patterns of the CuO-based catalysts after the reaction (Fig. S1c) show that the new diffraction peaks located at 43.3°, 50.5° and 74.2° correspond to (110), (200) and (220) planes of Cu (JCPDS 01-078-2076), and the diffraction peak located at 36.4° corresponds to (111) plane of Cu2O (JCPDS 01-070-3039). The semi-quantitative analysis of the XRD patterns by the method using reference intensity ratio confirms that metallic copper is the dominant copper species with minor quantities of Cu2O in all the examined catalysts after the cellulose conversion reaction at 280°C, suggesting that the reaction system composed of methanol and cellulose is reductive, leading to the reduction of CuO, and the generated Cu and Cu2O should be the active species in the CuO-based catalysts for methanol reforming and cellulose conversion reaction. Meaning while, there is no reduction for the other metal oxides in the catalysts during the cellulose conversion reaction. Table 2 compiles the surface areas and ICP-OES results of the catalysts. The BET surface area of CuO-based catalysts varies from 24 to 50m2/g. ICP-OES results suggest that the final component of the catalysts are in good agreement with that of the initial feeds (Cu/M/Al=68/23/9) during synthesis. SEM images of the CuO-based catalysts (not shown here) show that the CuO particles are in the range of 40–60nm in the CuO-based catalysts. The agglomeration of CuO particles is severe in CuO/Al2O3, while addition of the metal M (M=Ce, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) oxide can improve the dispersion of the CuO particles."
8,Proposed reaction pathway,"3.3 Proposed reaction pathway Fig. 2 shows the proposed reaction pathways involved in the conversion of cellulose over the CuO-based catalyst in the presence of methanol. The formation of gas products from CH3OH involves the methanol reforming reactions (Eq. (2)) to produce CO and H2, and CO reacts with water generated by dehydration of cellulose to form CO2 and H2 via the water–gas shift reaction (Eq. (3)) (Turco et al., 2011): (2) CH 3 OH ⇄ 2 H 2 + CO (3) CO + H 2 O ⇄ CO 2 + H 2 The hydrogen in the gas products can be used for the further hydrogenolysis of cellulose. In this process, Cu and Cu2O are active species for methanol reforming reaction (Idem and Bakhshi, 1994). For cellulose conversion reaction, firstly, cellulose rapidly depolymerizes to methanol soluble intermediates (Deng et al., 2011). Subsequently, the methanol-soluble intermediates are further converted via a series of successive or parallel steps. On the one hand, the intermediates can dehydrate to form ketones and furans (Roman-Leshkov et al., 2007), and then the ketones convert to C4–C7 alcohols by further hydrogenolysis or hydrogenation. In this step, the addition of ZnO, MgO and CeO can promote the dehydration reaction (Balaraju et al., 2008; Mullins et al., 2010; Reddy et al., 2011), which is favorable for the production of C4–C7 alcohols. On the other hand, the intermediates can form organic acids, which undergo dehydrogenation and rearrangement reaction (Davda et al., 2005), and also, the organic acids can react with methanol to form methyl esters (Heinze and Liebert, 2001). It is reported that addition of NiO can promote the dehydrogenation reaction (de Sousa et al., 2011), which is favorable for the production of methyl esters. As shown in this investigation, ZnO is effective to catalyze the dehydration of glycerol to yield acetol, which further undergoes hydrogenation on Cu sites to yield propylene glycol via the selective hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2 propanediol (Balaraju et al., 2008). Likewise, in this reaction system, CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is the most effective to promote the production of C4–C7 alcohols from cellulose because of the excellent performance of ZnO for the dehydration reaction. Therefore, it can conclude that catalyst compositions greatly affect the yield and distribution of both gas and liquid products. CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 exhibits the best catalytic activity among all the used catalysts. The following study was conducted to investigate the effect of reaction conditions on the conversion of cellulose over CuO–ZnO/Al2O3."
9,Cellulose conversion over CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst,"3.4 Cellulose conversion over CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst 3.4.1 Effect of reaction temperature Table 3 (entries 1–6) shows the effect of reaction temperature on the conversion of cellulose and the total volume of the gas products. At 220°C, the conversion of cellulose is only 61% and the total gas volume is 0.8L, indicating that both the methanol reforming reaction and cellulose conversion reaction are not active at this temperature. This may be associated with the uncompleted reduction of CuO to the active species of Cu and Cu2O at this temperature. As the reaction temperature increase from 220 to 320°C, the cellulose conversion and the total volume of gas products increase gradually, suggesting that higher reaction temperature favor the production of gas products in the presence of methanol. Fig. 3 a shows the influence of the reaction temperature on the gas products distribution in cellulose conversion over CuO–ZnO/Al2O3. Below 240°C, H2 and CO2 are detected as main products because the water–gas shift reaction is more likely to occur at lower temperature over CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 (Pradhan et al., 2009). Further increasing temperature leads to the decrease of CO2 amount and the increase of CO amount simultaneously due to the exothermic water–gas shift reaction, which is not favorable at high temperatures. The increased CO yield with the reaction temperature indicates the methanol reforming reaction is promoted by elevating temperature. Fig. 3b shows the distribution of liquid products at different reaction temperatures. According to the peak areas, the yield of C4–C7 alcohols increased with the change of reaction temperature from 220 to 280°C, but decreased again with the further increase of the reaction temperature. This can be attributed to the excessive hydrogenolysis of cellulose and the intermediate compounds, which leads to the formation of higher alcohols and more gas products (Liu et al., 2012). Based on the peak area (%) in Table S3, the main products over CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 are C4–C7 alcohols at 240–320°C, including butanol, pentanol, hexanol, cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol, and their derivatives. The relative content of C4–C7 alcohols is as high as 95.3% when the reaction temperature is 280°C. As the reaction temperature increases, it is noteworthy that the relative contents of 2-methyl-1-pentanol and 2-methyl-3-pentanol increase (entries 7 and 9 in Table S3). In contrast, the relative content of 2-methylcyclopentanol decreases sharply (entry 19 in Table S3). This indicates that ring-opening reaction is more likely to occur at higher reaction temperature (Moosavi et al., 1997). Besides, the relative content of 1-butanol, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol decreases with the increase of temperature (entries 1, 6 and 14 in Table S3), suggesting the hydrogenolysis reaction of these alcohols may occur at higher reaction temperature. Combining the conversion of cellulose and the yield of C4–C7 alcohols, the optimum reaction temperature is ca. 280°C. 3.4.2 Effect of the reaction time As shown in Table 3, the conversion of cellulose reaches 89% when the reaction time is 1min (entry 7 in Table 3), suggesting that conversion of cellulose to methanol-soluble intermediate happens rapidly under this reaction condition. The reaction time has slight effect on the conversion of cellulose (entries 4, 7–11 in Table 3), which is consistent with the previous work (Ishikawa and Saka, 2001). The total gas volume (entries 4, 7–11 in Table 3) and the distribution (Fig. 4 a) of gas products at different reaction times show that the former rises with reaction time, while there is no obvious changes for the latter, indicating that the reaction time has little effect on gas products. The effect of reaction time on the distribution of liquid products is presented in Fig. 4b. According to the peak areas, the yield of total liquid products increases with increase of the reaction time. Some methyl esters are observed when the reaction time is less than 10min. However, these methyl esters are not detected when the reaction time is longer than 30min. The peak area values of C4–C7 alcohols change little when the reaction time is longer than 120min, suggesting that the conversion of cellulose to C4–C7 alcohols can be completed within 120min. Based on the peak area (%) in Table S4, the relative content of C4–C7 alcohols increase with reaction time increasing and reach a maximum of 98.8% when the reaction time is 120min. With the increases of the reaction time, the relative content of 2-methylcyclopentanol and 1-methylcyclohexanol (entries 19 and 22 in Table S4) decreases significantly while that of some C4–C7 alcohols (entries 2, 4, 7, and 11 in Table S4) increases slightly. This confirms the occurrence of ring-opening reaction at longer reaction time. Accordingly, based on the yield and the relative content of C4–C7 alcohols in the liquid products, the optimized reaction time is 120min. 3.4.3 Effect of the cellulose amount As shown in Table 3 (entries 12–14), the conversion of cellulose becomes lower when the cellulose amount is more than 1.0g, due to the lack of available active sites of the CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst because the catalysts amount is constant in all examined experiments. Fig. 5 a shows the effect of cellulose amount on the distribution of gas products. It reveals that the volume fraction of CO2 increase drastically with the increase of cellulose amount, which can be attributed to the thermal decarbonylation of oxygen-containing functional groups in the cellulose to generate more CO2. Additionally, the content of H2 and CO as well as the total gas volume (entries 4, 12–14 in Table 3) becomes less at higher cellulose amount. This is because the dissolution of cellulose consumes a large amount of methanol, which inhibits the methanol reforming reaction. Fig. 5b presents the distribution of liquid products at different cellulose amounts. According to the peak area, the content of C4–C7 alcohols is the highest when the amount of cellulose is 1g, accompanying with the appearance of some methyl esters and furans. However, although the cellulose amount is double to 1g from 0.5g, the corresponding peak area of C4–C7 alcohols is not increased proportionally, indicating the production of C4–C7 alcohols per unit mass of cellulose is not increased accordingly. With further increase of the cellulose amount, the yield of C4–C7 alcohols becomes lower, accompanying with the observation of more unsaturated as well as oxygen-containing compounds such as methyl esters, furans, ketones and ethers. As shown in Table S5, based on the peak area (%), the relative content of C4–C7 alcohols decline as the cellulose amount increase, and the relative content of C4–C7 alcohols is only 29.4% when the cellulose amount is 4g. This may relate to the lack of reducing gas and the formation of intermediate products during the reaction, which lead to the formation of a large amount of unsaturated compounds. Considering the production of C4–C7 alcohols per unit mass of cellulose, the optimized cellulose amount is 0.5g. 3.4.4 Catalytic stability Fig. 6 gives the catalytic activities of CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 for cellulose conversion in four runs. It reveals that the yield and distribution of both gas products and liquid products have no obvious change during four circles. These results indicate that CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is stable and reusable under the reaction conditions."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, the conversion of cellulose to value-added chemicals over CuO-based catalysts in methanol is successfully demonstrated, in which, CuO-based catalysts play dual roles of catalyzing methanol reforming to generate H2 that is subsequently used for hydrogenolysis of cellulose to C4–C7 alcohols. It is found that the addition of CeO, MgO, and ZnO increase the yield of C4–C7 alcohols, while that of NiO promote the formation of unsaturated and oxygen-containing compounds. Among these catalysts, CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 exhibits the best catalytic activity and good stability. This work provides a new promising route to convert abundant renewable cellulose to liquid fuels."
