0,Introduction,"Oxidation of alcohols has been usually carried out with stoichiometric amounts of metallic oxidants, i.e., permanganates, chromium(VI) reagents, and ruthenium(VIII) oxide, which are environmentally unsafe species containing heavy metals [1a–e]. Both stoichiometric procedures utilizing a variety of oxidants as well as catalytic methods based on the use of coordination compounds of transition metals have been reported [1f]. Then the development of efficient systems to oxidize organic substrates is of great importance both by an economical and an environmental point of view. The selective oxidation of primary alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes is very important and widely used in organic syntheses [2a]. Many reagents as for instance TEMPO/NaClO, activated DMSO, pyridium chlorochromate (PCC), and Dess-Martin periodinane, have been proposed [2b]. Photochemistry in homogeneous media has been deeply studied during the last decades [3] and it has been applied both in preparation of chemicals [4] and degradation of contaminants [5]. Air purification can be achieved by photochemical reactions, while irradiation of water can lead to bactericidal results [6]. Nevertheless only very few studies have been published on the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes in homogeneous media, although this type of photoreaction has been deeply investigated in heterogeneous systems [7]. In these photooxidations, the concentration of oxygen generally enhances the disappearance rate of the reagent through first order kinetics [8]. In homogeneous systems, for example, ruthenium complexes [9] or ferric ions [10] have been used as the photocatalysts. Chen et al. [9] report that photocatalytic oxidations of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols under sunlight in water at ambient conditions produce aldehydes and ketones with high selectivity and turnover numbers higher than 100. A chromophore-catalyst dyad of ruthenium polypridyl complexes was used. Spasiano et al. [10a] also report a homogeneous photo synthesis of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol in water by using Fe(III) aquo-complex at very high pH (0.5) and high yield and selectivity values of aldehyde were obtained. In this context, to the best of our knowledge, autocatalytic photooxidations have never been reported and the role of molecular oxygen has not been investigated. The present study reports an unexpectedly autocatalytic photooxidation of 2-methoxybenzyl alcohol (MBA) to 2-methoxybenzaldehyde (MBAD). The reaction is catalyzed by the same MBAD, which is able to significantly increase the disappearance rate of the alcohol in water under UV irradiation. Depending on its concentration, molecular oxygen played the double role of MBA oxidant and MBAD excited state quencher [11]."
1,Experimental section,"Photoreactivity runs were performed by using a cylindrical batch photoreactor (internal diameter: 100mm; height: 126mm) of Pyrex. The photoreactor (Fig. 1 ) was provided with ports in its upper section for the inlet and outlet of gases and for sampling. The presence of a trap at the outlet of the reactor gas line ensured the insulation from external air so that the gas concentration in the reacting solution was constant. The aqueous solution (temperature of ca. 298K; volume of 800mL) was magnetically stirred and was bubbled with a gas containing different ratios of oxygen and nitrogen for 0.5h before turning on the lamp and during the run (the ratios were set by means of a Bronkhorst high-tech mass flow controller). The oxygen concentration was measured before each run by using a HD22559.2 apparatus (Delta Ohm). When 100% O2 was bubbled, a 1.2mM concentration was reached in water, and the latter figure decreased linearly with the percentage of the bubbled O2. A 125W medium pressure Hg lamp (Helios Italquartz, Italy), axially positioned within the photoreactor, was cooled by water circulating through a Pyrex thimble. The radiation energy impinging on the solution had an average value of 4.4mWcm−2; it was measured between 315 and 400nm by using a radiometer (Delta Ohm DO 9721). The initial 2-MBA (Sigma–Aldrich, >99% assay) concentrations were 0.15, 0.35 and 0.5mM. For a few runs MBAD (Sigma–Aldrich, >98% assay) was added to MBA solutions before irradiation to have different initial concentration ratios of C MBAD/C MBA. During the photoreactivity runs the samples were withdrawn from the reactor at fixed times. The identification and quantitative determination of MBA, the other investigated alcohols, and their oxidation products were performed by means of a Beckman Coulter HPLC (System Gold 126 Solvent Module and 168 Diode Array Detector), equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex 5μm C18 100 column (150mm long×4.6mm id) at 298K. The eluent consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile and 13mM trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution (20:80 v:v); its flow rate was 0.8mLmin−1. Species were identified by comparing their retention times and UV–vis spectra with those of standards. Mineralization extent was evaluated by total organic carbon (TOC) determination carried out by a 5000A Shimadzu analyser. H2O2 presence was confirmed by the absorption of the titanium(IV)–hydrogen peroxide complex (ca. 405–410nm) in a strong acidic medium [12]. The samples were added to TiCl4 in 6M HCl solution."
2,Results and discussion,"Fig. 2 a shows the disappearance of the alcohol under UV irradiation and in the presence of different concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which were kept constant during each run by continuously purging the solution with N2/O2 mixtures. Freshly prepared aqueous solution of MBA contained a 0.7% amount of MBAD; however, under these conditions, no photooxidation was observed in the absence of oxygen. When N2/O2 mixtures containing less than 2% of O2 were purged in the solution, MBA concentration decreased since the beginning of irradiation with zero-order kinetics (Fig. 2). In this range, the reaction rate increased with O2 percentage since a higher amount of oxidant was present in solution. Unexpectedly, by increasing the oxygen content above 2% in the purging gaseous mixture, the MBA oxidation process showed an induction period during which both MBA decreased and MBAD increased very slowly (Fig. 2a and b). A similar but unexplained lag time was observed in the photo-chemical oxidation of phenols in air saturated aqueous solution of various benzaldehydes [13]. Here, such induction time showed an almost linear dependence with the oxygen concentration in the purging gas mixture (Fig. 2c), and under oxygen saturated conditions (solution purged with 100% O2), the observed induction time increased to more than 16h (Table 1 ). This finding suggests that the involvement of MBAD as potential singlet oxygen sensitizer is marginal and can be ruled out, since it should have led to a reaction rate enhancement with increasing oxygen concentration. After the induction period, once the MBAD product reached a concentration high enough to compete with MBA for photon absorption and to overcome the quenching of its excited state by molecular oxygen, a knee-shaped decrease of MBA was recorded with a change of slope paralleling the production of MBAD and leading to the rapid decrease of the alcohol (Fig. 2b). While a total conversion of the MBA was achievable, MBAD yield was limited by its further photoreactivity, since prolonged irradiation time leads to aldehyde degradation products. Nevertheless total organic carbon (TOC) determinations performed for some selected experiments, indicated that a low extent of mineralization occurred after the partial conversion of MBA (>50%) under the experimental conditions adopted. Given the unusual photoreactivity results, a study of MBA oxidation in the presence of different starting amounts of MBAD was carried out by fixing the O2 content at 20% (Fig. 3 ). An increased initial amount of MBAD affected significantly the induction time (Table 1). The MBAD amount required to reach a significant reaction rate was indeed achieved sooner. Interestingly, when starting with a sufficient amount of MBAD (30% with respect to MBA, see Fig. 3), the reaction started immediately with approximate zero-order kinetics and only a short induction time was observed. On the other hand, the influence of a change in MBA initial concentration was less important and strictly related to the consequently lower production rate of MBAD. Other aromatic alcohols, in addition to MBA, were also tested for a preliminary investigation on the correlation between structural features and autocatalytic behavior. Thus, benzyl alcohol (BA), 3-methoxybenzyl alcohol (3-MBA), 4-methoxy-benzyl alcohol (4-MBA), 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol (2,4-DMBA), and 2,3,4-trimethoxybenzyl alcohol (2,3,4-TMBA) were irradiated by following the same protocol, and only 2,4-DMBA showed a similar behavior to MBA. The main emission peaks of the used lamp in the UV region are at 315 and 365nm (Fig. S1) and it is well known that Pyrex glass cuts off all the radiation below 300nm. Indeed, both MBAD and 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (2,4-DMBAD) show good absorption above 300nm (Fig. 4 ). The presence of some extent of absorption for these two aldehydes can be considered necessary but not determinant as also other methoxy-substituted aldehydes, which did not play any catalytic role, showed absorption above 300nm (Fig. 4). The lack of catalytic activity of 3-methoxy- and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde suggests that ortho-substitution is crucial. In this context, the absence of photocatalytic activity of 2,3,4-trimethoxybenzaldehyde could be tentatively explained in terms of steric hindrance affecting the conjugation between the phenyl ring and the three methoxy groups which could be maximized by the co-planarity of the substituents. The photooxidation of 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol (2-ChlBA), 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (2-HydBA), 2-nitrobenzyl alcohol (2-NitroBA) and 2-methylbenzyl alcohol (2-MethylBA) was also investigated in order to understand if the primary effect of ortho-substitution depends on the nature of the substituent group. The only significant activity was observed for 2-NitroBA that was photooxidized, with bad selectivity, to its aldehyde. Notably, it was previously reported that the presence of a nitro group produces a detrimental effect on the selectivity toward aldehyde formation [7c]. However, in this case, the aldehyde was not acting as catalyst since no beneficial effects were observed when a certain amount of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde was added in the reacting solution. Moreover, even the 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (2-HydBAD), which showed a good absorption above 300nm (Fig. S9), did not accelerate the photooxidation of 2-HydBA. Finally, the absence of photocatalytic activity of the chloro- (EWG, electron withdrawing group) and methyl- (EDG, electron donor group) derivatives rules out the involvement of electronic effect in the observed behavior. The attention was focused on the effect of oxygen concentration toward the selectivity of aldehyde formation (Table 2 ) for MBA conversions (X) of 50% and 70%. The highest selectivity values (98 and 85% for 50% and 70% conversions, respectively) were obtained when air was bubbled. In fact, the presence of a low amount of oxygen induced parallel reactions by producing secondary products whereas a very high oxygen concentration was detrimental for the conversion of MBA to MBAD favoring further degradation of MBAD. Table 3 reports conversion and selectivity obtained in runs where air was bubbled, starting from different initial concentration ratios of MBAD and MBA. Addition of a certain amount of MBAD to the reacting solution before irradiation produced a beneficial effect on the conversion as expected, whereas selectivity decreased when the MBAD to MBA ratios exceeded 0.05 value. The latter finding suggests an active role of MBAD not limited to simple sensitization. This was proven by further testing the photoreactivity of a 1:1 mixture of MBA and MBAD in water and in hexane in the absence of oxygen (bubbling N2) (Fig. 5 ). These experiments showed that a polar protic solvent was crucial to observe alcohol conversion whereas the aldehyde was photoreactive in both solvents. More importantly, in the absence of oxygen in water, MBA alcohol conversion virtually stopped as soon as the MBAD concentration dropped to zero (Fig. 5a). The observed behavior could be rationalized by considering Scheme 1 , where the photooxidation of MBA is favored by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. In this process the hydride abstraction can occur involving molecular oxygen. Small amounts of H2O2 were qualitatively detected by a colorimetric method (see Section 2). However, the mechanism reported in Scheme 1 will be quickly overcome by that reported in Scheme 2 , once MBAD concentration in water reaches a sufficient value to compete for photon absorption. MBAD can be photochemically reduced producing the ketyl radical species MBAD-H. Ketyl radicals can be formed under acidic conditions by reaction of protonated triplet excited states of non-phenolic aromatic aldehydes with electron donors [13]. Under the experimental conditions used in this paper, instead, the triplet state of the excited aldehyde can be reduced by hydrogen donor species [13]. When the reductant is the substrate MBA, the transfer of a benzylic hydrogen to the aldehyde triplet state produces two ketyl radicals (Scheme 2). The latter can react with dissolved O2 thus producing a peroxide radical species which decomposes into the hydroperoxide radical and MBAD [13]. This O2 addition would be nearly diffusion controlled. Alternatively, we cannot exclude that the ketyl radicals can be oxidized back to MBAD by reaction with any hydrogen atom acceptor species (e.g., the hydroperoxide radical), even if the concentration of any H-abstractor should be effectively lower than the oxygen concentration (even at low partial pressures). The processes reported in Scheme 1 are less favorite than those showed in Scheme 2, due to the scarce photon absorption of MBA around 300nm (see inset in Fig. S4a). The longer induction period observed by increasing oxygen concentration (Table 1) implies that the quenching step is faster than the formation of the peroxide radical (Scheme 2). Therefore, the higher reactivity observed by increasing O2 concentration in the range of low O2 concentrations is due to the beneficial contribution of O2 as illustrated in Scheme 1. The slower reactivity observed by increasing O2 concentration in the range of high O2 concentrations is due to the detrimental effect of O2 which quenches the aldehyde triplet state and delays the autocatalytic effect. Fig. 2a shows that after the induction period the reaction rates virtually do not depend on O2 when its concentration is in the 8–40% range (see the very similar slope of the plots). Under the experimental conditions adopted in this study this is consistent with the double role hypothesized for molecular oxygen which acts as oxidant and quencher (Scheme 2). Moreover, irradiations carried out at low O2 and MBAD percentages (CMBA >> C O 2 and CMBA >>CMBAD) resulted in a reaction rate linearly dependent from both MBAD and oxygen concentrations. In fact, when MBA is in a significant excess with respect to MBAD and O2 concentrations, the prevalent processes are (i) MBA direct photooxidation (Scheme 1) and (ii) MBA oxidation by 3[MBAD]* (Scheme 2). The latter process prevails over the quenching of 3[MBAD]* by molecular oxygen, given the excess of MBA over O2. On the other hand, when oxygen molar concentration is comparable to MBA, the quenching of the 3[MBAD]* species becomes prevalent and shuts down the oxidative processes illustrated in Scheme 2."
3,Conclusion,"In conclusion, an unusual autocatalytic photooxidation has been observed during UV irradiation of 2-methoxybenzyl alcohol in water. The corresponding aldehyde product showed a photocatalytic behavior which is inhibited when an excess of molecular oxygen is dissolved in the reaction medium. The quenching effect can be compensated by increasing the initial amount of MBAD. A reaction mechanism is suggested by considering the involvement of the ortho-methoxy substituent in MBA direct oxidation and the ambivalent role of molecular oxygen which can act both as an oxidant and as a quencher. Encouraging preliminary results about the use of MBAD as a co-catalyst for the photooxidation of other alcohols will be subject to further study."
