0,Introduction,"As a clean and sustainable energy resource, hydrogen has a very broad application prospect due to its advantages such as high energy density, high combustion heat value, and zero carbon emissions [1–3]. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the cornerstone reactions of water splitting, which relies on efficient catalysts [4]. To date, the platinum-based materials are generally recognized as the most irreplaceable and suitable catalyst for HER [5,6]. Considering the high commercial costs and poor durability of platinum/palladium based materials, developing noble metal-free alternatives with outstanding HER activity are highly significant [7–9]. In consideration of similar d-band states of Pt [10], transition metal-based materials [10–13], especially two-dimensional materials [14–16], exhibit excellent potential of HER. Based on the outstanding conductivity [17], hydrophilic surfaces [18], and flexibility [19], two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have broad applications in the fields of energy conversion and storage [20–23] and many other aspects [24–27]. Recent studies have revealed the certain potential of HER on titanium-based MXene materials. However, the relatively small specific surface area (SSA) and weak hydrogen adsorption limit the HER kinetics. This difficulty originates from the Volmer reaction of electrochemical hydrogen adsorption (H2O + M + e− ↔ M—H∗ + OH− in alkaline medium) [28,29]. Therefore, many research groups have modified the terminal functional based on MXene to improve electrocatalytic properties. Meanwhile, it is worth our attention that TiO2 as a typical semiconductor has been widely used in photocatalysis [30,31]. TiO2 has an appropriate forbidden bandwidth, so it has excellent light absorption properties and can absorb solar energy from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) light after treatment [30]. Due to the excellent conductivity of MXene, it can be used as a hole trapping agent to promote the separation of electrons and holes in the process of photo-enhanced electrocatalysis and improve the photo-electrocatalytic performance [32,33]. It is anticipated that MXene as a chemical compound of titanium and carbon provides a natural platform to construct TiO2 and carbonaceous materials [34,35], indicating their great potential as a promising photo-enhanced electrocatalytic HER catalyst, although little attention was paid before. Nevertheless, defect construction, involving OVs and atom doping, is carried out as a significant way to promote the catalytic properties of TiO2 [33,36]. Therefore, the design of homologous titanium-based hetero composites provides the possibility to expand the application of MXene materials in the field of hydrogen production, such as Pt atom doped [37,38], N atom doped [39], and S atom doped [40] catalyst. These reported articles say that although being doped to very small concentrations on the surface of MXene, they have very high efficiency in electrocatalysis. Herein, a novel MXene decorated by phosphorus-doped TiO2 (P–TiO2@Ti3C2) was successfully designed and synthesized. Compared with the other state-of-the-art reported MXene-based electrocatalysts without noble metal, P–TiO2@Ti3C2 showed a glorious promotion of electrocatalytic HER performance under Vis-NIR light irradiation. The in-situ grown TiO2 and OVs generated by single atom doping adequately increased SSA, suppressed electron-hole recombination, and broaden light absorption. Moreover, this electrocatalyst offered a distinct advantage of long-term stability for more than 50 h with light irradiation. This design concept is a powerful way to design active and stable electrocatalysts for HER, further opens the prospect of MXene-based catalysis with solar energy and electrical energy."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The Ti3AlC2 powders were purchased from Jilin 11 technology Co., Ltd. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were analytical reagent grade and were used without further purification. The solutions were prepared freshly with deionized (DI) water."
3,Synthesis of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 and MXene,"2.2 Synthesis of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 and MXene In a typical synthesis process, 0.1 g TiO2@Ti3C2 (The synthesis process is shown in Fig. S2, Supporting Information) and 0.5 g sodium hypophosphite were placed on both sides of the ceramic crucible with another crucible covered on the top. Subsequently, the crucibles were heated at 350 °C for 2 h under flowing Ar gas. In the comparison test, the control samples with different phosphorus dopants were designed with 0.1 g TiO2@Ti3C2 and 0 g, 0.25 g, 0.5 g, 0.75 g, 1 g sodium hypophosphite and named P–TiO2@Ti3C2-1/2/3/4/5, respectively. The MXene was obtained by etching the Ti3AlC2 (MAX) phase in 40% HF at room temperature for 48 h with constant stirring. Then, the as-prepared sample was filtered and washed with DI water several times until the pH reaching 6. Subsequently, putting it in a vacuum drying chamber at 80 °C for 24 h."
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by diffractometer (Bruker D8) using Cu Kα sources (λ = 0.15418 nm) with a step size of 0.04 and 2θ scans from 10° to 90°. X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometer (XPS) were obtained by Thermo ESCALAB 250 with monochromatic Al Kα source (hv ¼ 1486.6 eV) and a single neutral. All binding energies were calibrated at maximum C 1s at 284.6 eV on the carbon surface energetically. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images collected by Hitachi S-4800 microscopes equipped with powerful X-ray scattering analysis (EDS, EMAX Energy EX-350). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained by JEM 2100F microscopes at an acceleration of 200 kV. The solution of the samples was achieved after 20 min of ultrasonic pretreatment. TEM samples were prepared by dropping a primer solution on copper mesh with official polyvinyl support and air drying. The Raman spectrum obtained using the LabRam HR system from Horiba Jobin Yvon at room temperature with a 532 nm solid laser is an interesting source. The room temperature EPR spectra were recorded on Bruker E500 spectrometer. UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS) was performed by Shimadzu UV2550 recording spectrometer mounted on the 200 nm–900 nm mixing surface. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was measured by BELSORP-mini2. BaSO4 has been used as a reference."
5,Photo/electrochemical tests,"2.4 Photo/electrochemical tests All photoelectrochemical tests were used in electrochemical workstations (CHI 760E). The electrocatalytic properties and the photoelectrochemical test system of HER for P–TiO2@Ti3C2 were evaluated using a three-electrode system with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). In our experiments, we used Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl, E0 Ag/AgCl = 0.2046V, at 25 °C) and Pt as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The as-prepared sample was working electrode. The working electrode preparation method was as follows: First, added 5 mg sample into a mixed solution containing 20 μL of 5 wt% Nafion, 800 μL of alcohol, and 200 μL of DI water. And ultrasounding the mixed solution for 60 min. Then, 100 μL of the homogeneous fresh ink catalyst was deposited onto a glass plate of fluoride-doped thin oxide (FTO) and then dried at room temperature. For all samples, the loading value was estimated to be 0.5 mg cm−2. The measured potential versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated concerning the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The equation of HER potential measurement was ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.1976 + 0.0591 × pH in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Through calculation, the voltage shift was +1.0155 V versus RHE (1.0 M KOH, pH ∼ 13.9). During photoelectrochemical testing, Xenon 300 W lamp (PLS-SXE300C, Beijing Perfect Light Company) was used as the light source, providing visible light with it and measuring the light intensity with a spectrophotometer (International Light Technologies Model ILT950). Hydrogen evolution reaction curves were obtained with linear voltammetry scanning (LSV) with a scanning rate of 2 mV s−1 at 25 °C in aqueous solutions (1.0 M KOH) and constant access N2 for 30 min before the test. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in a potentiostat manner from 105 to 0.01 Hz. All the curves are stable ones after several cycles. All polarization curves were corrected with IR compensation."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Microscopic morphology analysis,"3.1 Microscopic morphology analysis The fabrication process of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 is briefly illustrated in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information). First, the 2D MXene nanosheets were fabricated by selectively exfoliating Al atoms layers from raw Ti3AlC2 (MAX) powder in HF aqueous solution, then filtering and washing the precursor (Fig. 1 a and Fig. S1, Supporting Information) [41]. Next, hydrothermal oxidation and phosphating of MXene got TiO2@Ti3C2 and P–TiO2@Ti3C2 accordingly (Fig. S2 and Fig. 1b, Supporting Information) [41,42]. As shown in Fig. 1, the shape of the MXene nanosheets is an obvious organ-like structure (Fig. 1a). After etching, the interlayer spacing of MXene was obviously increased, which made the SSA of the sample significantly increased, thereby exposing more active sites. Subsequently, the MXene was oxidized by hydrothermal oxidation, and many rectangular TiO2 nanocrystals were grown on the sheet structure (Fig. S2a, Supporting Information). Fig. S2b is an enlarged view of Fig. S2a. The rectangular TiO2 is evenly distributed on the nanosheets, and there is almost no breakage, indicating that the microscopic morphology of the material is well preserved after hydrothermal oxidation. Meanwhile, we regulated and optimized the amount of TiO2 (Figs. S10 and S11 Supporting Information). At the same time, in-situ grown TiO2 nanocrystals also increased the layer spacing of MXene nanosheets [41]. Next, P–TiO2@Ti3C2 was obtained via phosphorization (Fig. 1b). Phosphorus doped is a very effective method to increase the electron transport capacity and the number of OVs and active sites [42]. In quest of the photo-electrocatalytic performance of different phosphating amounts, the control samples with different phosphorus dopants were designed (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). The microscopic morphology and structure of different phosphating amounts under the same conditions are similar, which shows that our samples have strong structure stability. Meanwhile, the AFM result shows that our material has a higher surface roughness (Fig. S13, Supporting Information). The TEM image of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 with a nanoparticle size of around 500 nm is shown in Fig. 1c, further proofs that there are rectangular TiO2 nanocrystals between the layered MXene nanosheet structure. This is consistent with the previous SEM images. The HRTEM image of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 displays clear lattice fringes with inter-planar distances of 0.352 nm corresponding to (101) planes of TiO2 (Fig. 1 d) [43,44]. The lattice fringes with observed inter-planar distances of 0.983 nm correspond to Ti3C2 [45,46]. The SEM elemental mapping reveals the homogenous distribution of Ti, C, O, and P elements for the P–TiO2@Ti3C2 (Fig. 1e). The appearance of the phosphorus element initially proves the success of phosphorus-doped."
8,Structural and bonding characterization,"3.2 Structural and bonding characterization Compared with the untreated MXene sample, the characteristic diffraction peaks at 25.28, 37.80, 48.05, 53.89, 55.06, 62.69, 68.76, 70.31 and 75.03 corresponding to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220) and (215) planes of anatase TiO2 were detected (Fig. 2 a). The result exhibits that TiO2 nanocrystals have successfully grown in MXene by hydrothermal oxidation. There are no impurities and additional phosphide diffraction peaks in the diffraction pattern of the experimental range. Notably, they are negatively shifted to a lower angle relative to TiO2@Ti3C2 (Fig. 2a). It means that the interlayer distance of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 was expanded after phosphorus-doped. From the Raman spectrum, both the samples exhibit three main peaks at around 270, 400, 600 cm−1, which can all be assigned to the MXene (Fig. 2b) [47]. Meanwhile, the two treated samples exhibit a new emerging peak at 154 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 2b), indicating the emergence of the anatase TiO2. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra reveal the rich surface chemistry of as-prepared samples by the adsorption peaks for –OH bending vibration (1637 cm−1), and C–O (1047 cm−1) (Fig. 2c). In the yellow shaded part on the left, P–O (1400 cm−1) only appears in the P–TiO2@Ti3C2 sample, which shows that the element of phosphorus has been successfully doped. This is consistent with the previous conclusion. In the yellow shaded part on the right, only strong C–F (160 cm−1) appears in MXene, indicating that the hydrothermal oxidation process caused –OH, –O to replace –F. As shown in Fig. 2d, that all curves of synthesized materials belong to the Ⅳ category accompanied by a hysteresis loop. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis shows that the SSA of TiO2@Ti3C2 and MXene is 29.39 m2 g−1 and 10.75 m2 g−1, respectively. Because of the phosphorus-doped on the surface of TiO2@Ti3C2, The P–TiO2@Ti3C2 exhibits much larger BET SSA (49.48 m2 g−1) than that of other control samples [48,49]. The pore volume distribution curve (the inset of Fig. 2d) shows that P–TiO2@Ti3C2 has a maximum hole radius and the single point average hole radius is about 19.9 nm. Obviously, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis and the electrochemical surface area study (Fig. S12, Supporting Information) shows that P–TiO2@Ti3C2 has the largest specific surface area among the three samples, demonstrating the largest electrode-electrolyte contact area, which is good for improving the efficiency of the electrocatalytic reaction. And these results demonstrate that the physicochemical properties of product P–TiO2@Ti3C2 are optimal and the crystal structure of the materials is well maintained. The valence states, elemental composition, and bonding have been further investigated via the survey X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Elements in XPS survey spectrum are consistent with those obtained through EDS (Table S1, Supporting Information). As shown in Fig. 3 b, the Ti 2p spectra of the three samples exhibit four predominant peaks at ∼455.25, 456.35, 457.89, and 459.38 eV, which correspond to the Ti–C (2p3), Ti2+ (2p3), Ti3+ (2p3), Ti–O (2p3) bonds, respectively [47,50]. In addition, after hydrothermal oxidation and phosphorus-doped treatment, the emergence of the Ti–O peak in the XPS spectrum of TiO2@Ti3C2 and P–TiO2@Ti3C2 was accompanied by the decrease of all the other peaks, indicating that MXene was consumed and transformed to TiO2. And there is Ti–P only in the control sample of P–TiO2@Ti3C2. The C region is mainly fitted with three peaks at ∼285.35, 284.6, and 281.90 (282.16) eV, being ascribed to the C–O, C 1s, and C–Ti bonds, respectively (Fig. 3c). Compared with MXene, there are slight negative shifts in the control sample. It suggests the prominent interaction between OVs and electron-withdrawing species on MXene, which enables uniform dispersion of OVs while preventing them from excess growth and detachment upon synthesis and use. Correspondingly, the stability and catalytic performance of the material will be improved. The O region is fitted with four peaks at ∼530.15, 530.81 (531.12), 532.15, and 533.58 eV, being ascribed to the O–Ti–C, O–Ti (OH–Ti), O–C, and adsorbed H2O bonds, respectively (Fig. 3d). The appearance of the peak located at ∼531.45 eV is attributed to a high number of defect sites, that is, the increase of OVs. Detailed analysis shows that OVs are mainly located on the surface of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 nanosheets, which is very helpful for the fine-tuning of surface chemical and electronic structure and changing its electrocatalytic reactivity [51]. The P spectrum in Fig. 3e shows the existence of P–Ti and P–C bonds. This proves the successful doping of phosphorus, in agreement with the previous Raman spectroscopy. Considering the half-full p-electron orbital of phosphorus, the P–C peak is ascribed to the bonding between the carbon and doped phosphorus in MXene. At the same time, all the results rigorously prove that the oxidation and phosphating were carried out smoothly."
9,Electrochemical evaluation of HER activity,"3.3 Electrochemical evaluation of HER activity Based on the above results, the electrocatalytic alkaline HER performances of as-prepared samples both with and without light irradiation (about 100 mW cm−2) have been tested. Considering the presence of OVs in XPS, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has been further applied to identify the OVs in P–TiO2@Ti3C2. The MXene sample had no signal and TiO2@Ti3C2 nearly had no signal too. A strong EPR peak with a g value of 2.002 due to unpaired electrons was observed in P–TiO2@Ti3C2, indicating the presence of OVs caused by phosphorus-doped (the inside of Fig. 4 a) [52]. As shown in Fig. 4a, the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of TiO2@Ti3C2 is similar to TiO2. Because TiO2 was obtained by hydrothermal oxidation, and TiO2 is an excellent photocatalytic semiconductor material, so we determined that the TiO2@Ti3C2 could produce a light response under visible light [38]. The optical response of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 is largely extended to the near-infrared regions, which provides the possibility of light-enhancing electrochemical properties. This is partly due to the introduction of OVs [53]. As we can see from Fig. 4b, HER activity improves significantly after a short duration of visible light treatment. TiO2@Ti3C2 has an overpotential (driving 10 mA cm−2) of ∼178 mV and a Tafel slope of 83.2 mV dec−1 in the dark. When exposed to visible light, it exhibits a slightly lower overpotential of ∼160 mV and a smaller Tafel slope of 72.1 mV dec−1. But when we doped phosphorus with TiO2@Ti3C2, the best sample of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 is optimized more exaggeratedly. It has an overpotential (driving 10 mA cm−2) of ∼138 mV and a Tafel slope of 73.5 mV dec−1 in the dark. When exposed to visible light, it exhibits a much lower overpotential of ∼97 mV and a smaller Tafel slope of 48.4 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4c) and performs favorably comparable to the state-of-the-art HER MXene-based catalysts. It can also be expressed through the image of Fig. S5. Compared with the present work with reported other MXene-based without noble metal electrocatalysts for HER (Table S3, Supporting Information), the catalytic performance of the catalyst used in this article has been greatly improved. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots reveal that the charge transfer resistance of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 is much lower than that of TiO2@Ti3C2, indicating accelerated charge transfer kinetics for P–TiO2@Ti3C2 catalyst (Fig. S7a, Supporting Information). Although the resistance increases slightly after oxidation (Fig. S7a, Supporting Information), according to the previous analysis, the OVs generated with the phosphorus-doped can modify the electronic properties, improve the electronic conductivity, and create more active sites, thereby enhancing the HER electrocatalytic performance [53]. When exposed to visible light, it exhibits a much lower overpotential. When we turn our attention to Fig. S7b, we can clearly see that the resistance decreases significantly after exposure to visible light. In order to clarify the role of OVs, samples 1/2/3/4/5 with different amounts of phosphorus-doped were synthesized (Table S2, Supporting Information). With the doping amount increases, the intensity of the EPR signal of OVs significantly grows (Fig. 4d). The results show that phosphorus-doped is positively correlated with OVs. And the above measurement of the relative amount of OVs helps predict the light absorption and photo-electrocatalytic performance of the material. This is consistent with the electrocatalytic performance without light irradiation (The left half of Fig. 4e). Through the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra test, it can be found that all the control samples have a light response (Fig. S8, Supporting Information). Compared with sample 4/5 with much phosphorus-doped and more OVs, Vis-NIR light absorption of Sample 3 (P–TiO2@Ti3C2) is enhanced. Therefore, we can conclude that the continued increase in phosphorus-doped and OVs will cause degenerative absorption and result in decreased catalytic performance. This trend can be clearly seen through polarization curves with light irradiation (The right half of Fig. 4e) and f. In addition, as shown in Fig. S6b, the dramatic changes of the Tafel slope indicating that the fast kinetic reaction of the HER catalyst requires a suitable amount of phosphorus-doped. The main reason is that superfluous phosphorus-doped will lead to a reduction in SSA, hindering electron transport [42]. Therefore, the appropriate amount of phosphorus-doped is most beneficial to photo-electrocatalytic performance. Upon visible light irradiation, the excitation of external energy leads to the separation of electrons and holes in TiO2 semiconductors. At the same time, MXene as a hole-trapping agent further promoted the electron transport of the semiconductor. Under the combined action of the external electric field and visible light, hydrogen production efficiency was further improved (Fig. S9, Supporting Information)."
10,Stability test,"3.4 Stability test Cycle stability is another criterion indicator of photo-electrocatalysts. Therefore, a time-dependent current density curve at a static potential was conducted. Upon application of the cathode current, the current rapidly decreases to ∼ −0.5V vs. RHE within a very short period of time. After about 50 h, there is a slight change in the current, exhibiting remarkable electrocatalytic stability for HER. It demonstrates that P–TiO2@Ti3C2 retains a steady photo–electrocatalysts activity in alkaline solution for nearly 50 h. Tiny changes can be found in the polarization curves of P–TiO2@Ti3C2 before and after the current stability test (The inset of Fig. 5 a). And the consecutive 1000 CV cycles analysis shows that the changes after stability experiments were negligible (Figs. S14 and S15, Supporting Information). By comparing the initial and after stability test of XRD, the characteristic peaks of MXene (The position marked by the red dotted line.) exist and there is almost no obvious deviation between the two patterns (Fig. 5b). The SEM and HRTEM images show that the morphology and structure are stable after durability testing (Fig. 5c and d). After the HER reaction was completed, the lattice fringes of TiO2 and MXene could be clearly found, which is consistent with the previous image results, and further illustrates that the existence of OVs makes the stability of the material structure enhanced."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, MXene decorated by phosphorus-doped TiO2 (P–TiO2@Ti3C2) was designed and synthesized to improve photo-enhanced electrocatalytic HER ability. The experimental results showed that the number of OVs increased, meanwhile the SSA of the product greatly magnified. This synthesis strategy greatly improved the electrochemical performance with light irradiation, compared to that in darkness. This originated from the increased charge density near the maximum value of the valence band, resulting in excellent charge transfer kinetics, the chemical affinity of the catalyst, and the ability to absorb and activate hydrogen. Moreover, a small overpotential of 97 mV, a low Tafel slope of 48.4 mV dec−1, and superior stability over 50 h were exhibited in alkaline solution under light irradiation. This specific design strategy of MXene decorated by phosphorus-doped TiO2 to increase OVs opens a new avenue for solar and electrical energy applications."
