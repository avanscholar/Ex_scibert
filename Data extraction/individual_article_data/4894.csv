1,Feedstock for alternative energies,"1.1 Feedstock for alternative energies Biofuels are considered as a potential replacement to fossil based fuel, and they are considered as non-toxic, renewable and alternative fuel [6,75]. Various feedstock are being investigated for alternative energies and among the feedstocks exploited, bioenergy production from algae is desirable due to their high photosynthesis efficiency, higher rate of carbon dioxide fixation, higher productivity in terms of biomass, high lipid content, and faster growth rate [64]. At this juncture, diverse algal species are found ubiquitously in a wide range of habitats ranging from freshwater to marine, thus providing a number of options to choose from. Additionally, biofuels derived from algae have significantly less environmental impacts as compared to fossil fuels."
2,Biochar as promising catalyst,"1.2 Biochar as promising catalyst Biofuel production from microalgae involves biochemical, chemical and thermochemical routes. Chemical routes mainly include transesterification, biochemical includes anaerobic digestion, fermentation, and thermochemical methods include torrefaction, pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), hydrothermal gasification, and hydrothermal liquefaction [3,8,37]. To enhance the efficiency of these chemical reactions, catalysts play a major role in increasing the rate of reaction thereby increasing the quality and yield of the product [73]. Not only that, catalytic activity is effective only in thermodynamically feasible chemical reactions. When there is a reversible reaction, catalyst does its activity both in forward and backward reactions [9]. Different alkali, acid and enzyme based catalysts are being used by various researchers for the production of biofuel. Different homogeneous acid/base and heterogeneous acid/base catalysts were also utilized for biodiesel production. Heterogeneous catalysts are of interest over homogeneous catalyst due to easy separation of catalysts, and conversion efficiency etc, and the chemical reaction takes place at the surface of these catalysts [9,81]. In concern with enzyme based catalyst, lipase enzyme is widely used for the conversion of lipid into biodiesel and further, immobilized lipase enzymes from many bacteria are utilized to maintain the stability of enzyme and also to increase the yield [72]. In recent times, biochar based catalyst have gained much attention to produce biodiesel from microalgal lipids. Biochar is majorly a carbonaceous fuel produced by thermochemical methods. The rich carbon content material/biochar is arranged with random and irregularly stacked aromatic carbon rings and is classified as non-graphitizable. This is because biochar cannot be changed to graphitic carbon even at high temperature of 2700 °C. Even though the property of having rich carbon content is similar to graphite; its structure differs where the carbon atoms are arranged in a two-dimensional manner with parallel stacking, much like a planar hexagonal network [95]. Moreover, its application depend on the properties it possesses from the biomass origin and its different preparatory conditions which includes its use as electrode material, supercapacitor, soil ameliorant, catalyst etc. For biochar to be used as catalyst, factors such as surface area, functional groups on surface, and nature of the matrix are considered [17]. However, the resulting biochar directly after production processes have poor physicochemical properties and vary based on the types of a) biomass, b) carbonization procedure, and c) activation strategies. Upon activation, the tuned biochar can be used as a potential catalyst for various applications because of its large surface area, high porosity and ability to hold many surface functional groups [12]. In this regard, reports on biochar production, activation and its application are scarce. An in-depth review on biochar application as a catalyst for biofuel production is need of the hour. Therefore, this present review was undertaken to highlight why biochar catalyst is important for fuel production and its advantages. The methods employed for the production of biochar from numerous algal strains will be discussed in detail. Further, the application of biochar catalyst in biomass pyrolysis, biodiesel, and biohydrogen production will be extensively reviewed using copious literature."
3,Biochar production techniques,"Biochar is obtained through thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis, HTC, torrefaction and hydrothermal liquefaction. Temperature, pressure, and biomass composition play a vital role in the production of biochar and the biochar yield in percentage may vary between the thermochemical methods and in this article, biochar from pyrolysis and HTC was discussed."
4,Pyrolysis,"2.1 Pyrolysis Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process in which ultimately biochar or bio-crude is produced from various biomasses under higher temperature and pressure and it is one of the oldest methods of biomass processing which refers to charring of compounds under high temperature in a closed reactor where the oxygen content is less or not available. The temperature ranges from 350 to 650 °C where the major products are classified as solid (biochar), liquid (bio-oil) and gas (syngas). Based on the temperature, residence time, particle size and heating rate pyrolysis is categorized into slow, fast and flash pyrolysis [62]. Biochar and bio-oil production through different pyrolysis and gasification of different biomass in the presence and absence of oxygen is illustrated in Fig. 1 . For large quantities of biochar production, slow pyrolysis is preferred because, gradual increase in temperature and slow degradation of biomass having longer residence time favors the production of biochar than bio-oil and syngas [10]. The complexity in reaction mechanism of biomass pyrolysis can be simplified into three reactions. In the first step, dehydration of biomass takes place followed by primary biochar formation with the leftover biomass where some volatile components and gas are lost. In the last step, secondary char is formed by slow decomposition of primary char resulting in a carbon rich material [22]. Moreover, the pyrolysis temperature also influences the properties of biochar such as surface area, and surface functional groups. At high temperature, the surface area of biochar and porosity is increased because of the breakage of aliphatic alkyls and ester groups of the organic compounds, thereby removing the pore blocking substances [61]. The as-produced biochar is hydrophobic and thermally stable whereas the biochar produced at low pyrolysis temperature is hydrophilic in nature. On the other hand, at higher temperature chemical bonds are rearranged and new surface functional groups such as carboxyl, lactone, phenol, pyridine etc are introduced. These surface functional groups can act as electron acceptor or donor. In case of low pyrolysis temperature, the biochar produced simulates the graphene structure and exposes less functional groups on its surface [17,83]. The fast pyrolysis process is performed to obtain high quality bio-oil from algae. Fast pyrolysis of a green alga Scenedesmus sp. was carried out at 500 °C with vapor residence time of 2 s and 55% bio-oil was observed [35] and in Chlorella vulgaris, 53% of bio-oil was obtained at the fast pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C [86]."
5,Hydrothermal carbonization,"2.2 Hydrothermal carbonization Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a thermochemical conversion process aimed at utilizing wet biomass or biomass with high moisture content for producing charred biomass (referred as hydrochar) wherein it employs the use of varied wet biomass such as municipal wastes, forest and agricultural residues, algal biomass, animal and human wastes etc [54]. A typical HTC reactor model was illustrated in Fig. 2 . Hydrochar and biochar is similar to some degree; however obtained from different thermochemical processes. Unlike biochar, hydrochar- produced from HTC, is a slurry comprises of two-phase mixture (solid and liquid) and both charry products notably differ in their physico-chemical features [46]. This technique was discovered by Bergius in 1913 which simulated the natural conversion of cellulose to coal alike materials and is referred as artificial coalification which was later re-discovered and referred as HTC, wet torrefaction, subcritical water treatment, etc. [88]. The temperature for conversion is moderate i.e., 150 − 350℃ under heat and pressure of roughly 10–15 bar with water (under sub-critical or supercritical) as the reaction medium and it does not produce any unsafe by-products and chemicals [93]. Therefore, when biomass is utilized, the water contains some uncharred minerals, for instance ammonium, potassium and phosphorus salts present in water can be used as fertilizers and at the same time, conversion of total carbon content from the biomass to final charred product is almost 100% [50]. The reaction mechanism for the breakdown of biomolecule is still not fully understood because of the complexity in the biomass composition. It is reported that the during HTC, decomposition of biomass is characterized by some reactions which include hydrolysis, dehydration, decarboxylation, aromatization and recondensation [54]. Though there are many production processes for char, composition, yield, and the physico-chemical properties varies according to the operating conditions and the type of biomass used (Table 1 ). Hydrochar has many applications namely i) soil amendment ii) adsorbent iii) activated charcoal production iv) hydrogen storage v) super capacitors for energy storage vi) solid fuel vii) waste water treatment [59,77]."
6,Biochar composition,"The organic carbon rich charring content produced from pyrolysed biomass is called biochar [57]. It contains oxygen content abundantly 27–34% in the form of phenolic and carboxylic acid groups with the presence of sulfonic group leads to improved catalytic activity and molecular absorption on surface of catalyst. Biochar is a highly fixed carbon substance obtained from the organic products notable for many applications with respect to its prominent attributes such as stability, porosity, recalcitrance potential and CO2 sequestration [90]. It constitutes about more than 65% carbon content and are produced by thermal decomposition of biomass under less or no oxygenic conditions [19,90]. The charred biomass mainly contains different percent of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen and varies for different types of biomass. The physicochemical properties of biochar depends on i) feedstock/biomass type ii) pyrolysis temperature iii) residence time iv) activating methods v) reaction container [40,66]. Almost all kinds of biomass, starting from forest residues to agricultural residues have been used as biochar catalysts for varied applications (Table 2 )."
7,Why biochar based catalysts?,"The purpose of employing biochar as heterogeneous catalysts or supports include cheaper cost, large surface area, functional group tailoring etc., make an ideal for biodiesel production. Biochar possess stable structure, good thermal and mechanical stability, chemically inert, increased acid density and environmental friendly nature [15]. Biochars – material with inert pores where the transesterification reaction occurs at higher temperatures. As these biochars are ecofriendly, cheap and reusable, many researchers opt to explore these green catalysts. Recyclable biochar based catalysts revealed better activity when compare with conventional acid catalysts during simultaneous reactions of esterification and transesterification of non-edible oils [70]. The presence inorganics (K and Fe) imparts better catalytic activity for biochar [17] and the presence of functional groups on the biochar surface is advantageous for metal precursor adsorption towards synthesis of biochar-supported metal catalyst [12]. Biochar based catalyst is beneficial as the biochar production method is lucrative and simple due to sustainable feedstock availability and the physicochemical properties of biochar are simply modified by various activation methods. Most importantly, surface functional groups, inorganic species presence, a hierarchical structure inherited from biomass are few intrinsic features of biochar to consider it as a better catalyst in several catalytic applications [17]. Biochar based catalysts are i) heterogeneous i.e., it can be easily separated from other reactant mixtures ii) bifunctional catalyst i.e., it performs esterification and transesterification iii) reusable iv) highly porous v) nongraphitizable i.e., even at high temperature exposure it does not form crystal [95]. On comparing with other solid based catalysts that are commercially available, biochar holds a high position due to its i) low cost ii) eco-friendly iii) easy production processes, iv) reusability, and v) biodegradability."
8,Utilization of biochar catalyst for fuel production,
9,Transesterification and esterification,"5.1 Transesterification and esterification Among different applications of biochar like waste water treatment, water filtration, and CO2 sequestration, the catalyst or catalyst support material for biofuel production is the significant use of biochar (Fig. 3 ). Recently, there is an increasing attention on using carbon based materials as catalysts since they possess higher stability in acid/base media, texture and surface chemistry modification properties. Functionalization of biochar is mainly based on the abundant presence of surface functional groups which facilitated clinching of metal cations during synthesis of biochar supported metal catalysts [17]. Some of the biochar based catalyst that aids in biodiesel production are discussed below. For the production of biodiesel from the biomasses of Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Isochrysis sp. using response surface methodology, cheaper heterogeneous biocatalysts were developed. It was reported that higher FAME yield (32.8% – Isochrysis biochar, 26.45% – conventional acid catalyst) through biochar catalyst and iron nanoparticles [5]). The nanocatalysts based biodiesel production is particularly focused nowadays, due to nil reusability of homogeneous acid catalysts and need of high cost purification systems once they are used. The biochar supported CaO catalyst in optimal conditions (3 wt% catalyst, 6 h, 12:1 methanol/oil molar ratio) yielded up to 96% biodiesel from Turbonilla striatula and deoiled cake of Mesua ferrea Linn seeds [49]. Biochar based catalysts prepared by concentrated sulfuric acid showed limited transesterification and considerable free fatty acid conversion activity while the other prepared using fuming sulfuric acids showed increased transesterification efficiency. Further the biochar was treated with 10 M KOH and resulted catalysts with highest catalyst activity towards biodiesel production from canola oil due to their increased surface area and acid density [21]. The pseudocatalytic transesterification of waste cooking oil with generated biochar from maize yielded 90% biodiesel and with pine cone biochar yielded 43% at 300 and 380 °C respectively. The biodiesel yield was mainly affected by lignin content of biomass rather the cellulose and hemicellulose [51]. The hydrophobicity of biochar creates interaction of organic chains in surface, prevents formation of water which is undesired product lower the catalytic activity and accelerates transesterification reaction [79].The bamboo was partially carbonized at 300–500 °C, treated with 98% sulfuric acid and obtained acid heterogeneous catalysts were poured into three necked batch reactor system with oleic acid and ethanol. The catalyst showed 98.4% esterification efficiency at 90 °C, ethanol to oleic acid molar ratio of 7 and 6% heterogeneous acid addition [103]. Sulfonated biochar with ethanol at 60 °C showed 77–88% FFA conversion from waste vegetable oil [21]. These yields were comparable to model fatty acids palmitic and stearic acids with conversion of 70–100% at 50–60 °C with adequate methanol [47]. Catalyst activity, biodiesel quality was affected by amounts of chlorophylls and phospholipids present in biomass for e.g., microalgae [92]. Sulfonated vegetable oil asphalt based catalyst was tested for its efficiency to convert triglyceride and FFAs. As expected, this catalyst has shown 80.5% and 94.8% conversion efficiency of triglyceride and FFAs respectively at 0.2 wt% of catalyst to oil ratio; 16:8 M ratio of methanol to oil. Large pore size, more active sites and the presence of hydrophilic sulfonic acid group makes the above said catalyst a easily accessible one for the reactants [78]. The advantages of solid acid/base catalysts include higher surface area and stability, reusability, simple low cost purification. However issues of low reactivity, stability and smaller pore size, lengthy reaction times were associated with developed nanocatalysts [31]. Similarly, biochar from jatropha seed was used as catalyst in the conversion of FFAs from jatropha oil. The authors reported that at 12:1 M ratio of methanol to oil; 7.5 wt% of catalyst, they could achieve 99.13% of conversion efficiency of FFA [63]. In another study, flamboyant pod catalyst functionalized with KOH was used in biodiesel production from Hevea brasiliensis oil. This study reported 89.3% of biodiesel yield at 15:1 M ratio of methanol to oil; 3.5 wt% of catalyst. Also, the performance of catalyst for reuse is around 7 times where the yield of biodiesel was almost significant every time [23]. On the other hand, palm seed based acidic catalyst have shown 97.8% biodiesel yield from palm fatty acid distillate and the reusability was around 8 times [2]. Sulfonated biochar from cassava peel have shown 96.8% biodiesel yield upon transesterification of Derris indica L seed oil. The mechanism behind fuel production facilitated by biochar catalyst is given below. The reaction rate of transesterification and the FAME yield can be enhanced by using porous material as catalyst. The advantage of using high porous material i.e., biochar for transesterification lies in providing enough active sites for the two reactants (methanol and triglycerides) to react at low temperature. During transesterification, a two phase system (liquid phase – lipid, gas phase - solvent) is created by heating lipids with solvent. The inert pores of solid biochars are filled with reactants and react easier due to lower activation energy [41]. The usual mesoporous and microporous biochar accommodates average dimension of 5.8 nm large triglyceride molecules during transesterification reaction. The majority of surface active sites of biochars are accessed by their mesoporosity [51]. For instance, when the two reactants methanol and triglycerides are collided in the pores, less activation energy is required which ultimately speed up the reaction rate [43]. Pore size of biochar plays an important role in transesterification and its size should be greater than the reactant molecule. Based on the research findings, the diameter of triglyceride and glycerin molecules is found to be 2.5 nm [102]. Hence, any biochar that claims to be enhancing the transesterification process should have the pore size greater than 2.5 nm for effective FAME yield. For example, FAME yield using biochar derived from mixture of leaf varieties (pore size – 2.785 nm) by direct transesterification of Isochrysis sp. was 32.8% which was higher than the conventional acid catalyst (26.45%) at 9 wt% of catalyst to dry cell weight [5]. However, sulfonated oat hull biochar have shown higher FAME yield of approximately 90% for waste cooking oil at 10 wt% of catalyst to oil ratio; 1:10 M ratio of oil to methanol [32]. Another study reported FAME yield of 91% from waste cooking oil when maize residue biochar was used at 200 mg for 10 µL of oil and 0.2 mL of methanol [52]. Jung et al. [42] reported the FAEE (Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester) yield of 87% when maize residue biochar was used to transesterify the coconut oil. The microalgae residue used for biodiesel production was partially carbonated in situ and sulfonated with sulfuric acid (1:12 ratio) in an autoclave within 2 h. Characterization with XRD showed random oriented atomatic carbon sheets which were favorable for -SO3H groups anchoring, FTIR shown -SO3H, –COOH, –OH groups as active sites. Based on results prepared MBC (microalgae residue based) catalyst was similar to solid carbon based acid catalyst prepared from cellulose powder. Transesterification of oleic acid with methanol using 5 wt% MBC catalyst showed 98% conversion [30]. The FFA from animal fats, vegetable oils alcohols of low molecular weight undergo esterification to give biofuel esters. The conversion of 97–98% FFA from microalgal oil with methanol for three runs at 100 °C [24]."
10,Biohydrogen production,"5.2 Biohydrogen production Hydrogen is the cleanest and purest form of fuel with high energy value of 140 KJ/g. It does not pose any risk to environment as the combustion by-product is only water vapour [45]. Despite its advantages, it has high production cost which keeps them a little away from demand. So far, hydrogen production from fossil fuels by steam reformation of natural gas or methane is employed widely. But due to depletion of fossil fuels, alternative production from biomass has been suggested worldwide [13]. Over the years many catalysts are introduced to increase gas production and quality of hydrogen gas. Catalysts such as potassium mineral, nickel based catalyst, dolomite, cement kiln dust etc are being used for hydrogen production from biomass [34,39,76]. However, the above said catalysts get deactivated due to the deposition of coke like substance on the surface of catalyst during the hydrogen production process. But some promoters like Ca, Na, Li are added to reduce coke formation. It is known that biomass also contains certain metals which retains after pyrolysis. So, biochar can be ultimately used as catalyst without adding any promoters. The main role of catalyst in biohydrogen production is its ability to reduce tar content and to enhance the water-gas shift reaction during the process of biomass gasification [26,94]. This formed the basis of biochar based catalyst usage in hydrogen production through biomass gasification. Cotton char impregnated with nickel have shown highest yield of hydrogen i.e., 92.08 mg/g of biomass which is 64.02 vol% from biomass gasification at 15 wt% of catalyst. It was concluded that higher loading of nickel produced H2 with higher molar fraction and also presence of alkaline earth metals favours hydrogen production [94]. In other case, algal biochar from Sargassum was used as catalyst for hydrogen evolution from the pyrolysis of raw algae, which gave minimal amount of hydrogen i.e., 3 mmol/g of Sargassum [80]. Similarly, biochar from Cladophora glomerata impregnated with Fe yielded hydrogen 7.99 mmol/g algae from the pyrolysis of C. glomerata [69]."
11,Biomass hydrolysis,"5.3 Biomass hydrolysis Biomass hydrolysis is one of the pretreatment processes that help in breaking the complex macromolecules to simple micromolecules and generally, hydrolysis is practiced in industries for converting cellulose to monosaccharide glucose with the help of catalysts. Biochar based catalysts from different sources like forest residues, municipal wastes, land residues etc are directly used or used with appropriate modification that includes introduction of charges to surface or functionalization with chemical groups (carbonyl, carboxyl, phenolic moieties) or sulfonation. Upon sulfonation, protons in sulfonic acid group (SO3H) attacks β-1,4 glycosidic bonds in cellulose and the activation energy required for conversion is less than that of acid catalyst [33]. These biomass based catalyst or green catalyst are getting more and more attention in biomass hydrolysis process. For example, methyl glucosides from cellulose was obtained through sulfonated carbon catalyst [25]; 5-hydroxymethylfurfural from starch rich food waste was obtained from sulfonated wood biochar [11]; furfural synthesis through hydrolysis of cornhob was obtained using SnO2-CO3o4/C biochar catalyst [56]. Wei [89] reported the use of bamboo based biochar produced by molten alkali carbonate pyrolysis for the conversion of cellulose into glucose. The produced biochar was modified by sulfonation where the sulfonic acid groups were attached to the bamboo biochar surface. On usage of this catalyst in cellulose hydrolysis, he obtained 43.5% of glucose and 52.8% total reducing sugar. Generally, biochar based catalysts are combined with acids to produce biochar-based solid acid catalyst by means of sulfonation or by introducing acidic groups. Besides these, biochar directly after production process exhibits its own weak acid groups that aid in hydrolysis of biomass [12]. In fact, it is advisable to use biochar-based solid acid catalyst instead of acid catalyst alone because of the following reasons i) biochar enhances the strength of introduced acid groups ii) its tolerability to hydration iii) its catalytic activity does not decrease as the reaction proceeds [53]. In the recent study, biochar from nine different types of biomass were used for glucose fermentation, which consisted of rice husk, wood, longan shell, white popinee, pinecone, bagasse, bamboo, coconut, borncob. The addition of biochar enhanced the fermentation process for the intermediates, acetate and pyruvate, by being the carrier and adsorbent of volatile fatty acids [58]."
12,Conclusion and future prospects,"Selection of catalysts for biofuel production is important step in obtaining improved yield of biofuel with desirable quality. Over the years, the choice of catalyst for biofuel production changes from base to acid, homogeneous to heterogeneous, chemical to enzyme catalysts. Recent past, biochar based catalysts are used for converting lipid or triacylglycerols to biodiesel through transesterification reaction. fHowever, the activation methods for biochar to use as catalyst need to be analyzed intensely to make the biochar work efficiently for several applications. The applications of biochar have many advantages from environmental point of view. However, the economical aspects need to be estimated based on the production cost and investments on the conversion technology. It is undeniable to say that the biochar is getting more and more attention from scientific researchers in the recent times and do continue in the future as nature has given enough of it in the environment. It is because of its diversity that a standard protocol is not well established on its production processes and its physicochemical properties. Even though many researches focus on different aspects of biochar application, its use as catalyst have been studied at a small scale. Thus, it is essential to investigate more on a large scale to understand its potential in long-term feasibility and economic viability. Moreover, replacing old technologies in the field of biochar production such as conversion technology, equipment, activation strategies etc with new technologies are necessary to achieve a major breakthrough in the field of biochar-based catalyst."
