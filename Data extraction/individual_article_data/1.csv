0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a green energy, which is recognized as promising alternatives to existing energy forms (e.g., coal, petroleum, fossil fuels, etc.) for our society in future. [1–4] Sustainable hydrogen production, especially from water splitting has been thus attracted much attention [5–8]. Unfortunately, hydrogen production from water splitting (namely hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) is a nonspontaneous process and a voltage of 1.23 V is required. During water splitting, HER of cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of anode are involved simultaneously. The existence of the overpotentials at both electrodes leads to the application of a potential even higher than 1.23 V for water splitting. Meanwhile, the reaction kinetics of OER is slower than that of HER. This is because the OER involves a four-electron transfer process together with the OO bond formation, while HER is only a two-electron transfer process. In other words, OER is the rate-limiting step overall water splitting [9–13]. Therefore, it is important to decrease the overpotential of OER for hydrogen production. Design and utilization of various OER electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production has been widely explored. [14,15] As an alternative strategy, the replacement of the OER with a favorable oxidation reaction appears to be more efficient for producing hydrogen through water splitting. For example, the oxidation of biomass derivatives (e.g., glucose, glycerol, ethanol and benzyl alcohol) is a promising reaction to replace OER in that its oxidation potential is lower than 1.23 V [16–19]. On a Ni3S2 anode the oxidation of ethanol, benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural led to simultaneous hydrogen production. [20] The photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose on the C@Cr-SrTiO3/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 photoanodes promoted hydrogen production on the cathode. [21,22] Note that, the reported rates of hydrogen production were gradually slowed down over the longer electrolysis time, although it is expected to be varied linearly as a function of the electrolysis time, especially in the primary stage of the oxidation of these biomasses. Such decrease in the rate of hydrogen production was assumed to originate from un-controllable intermediates produced during the oxidization of these biomass derivative. Taking a typical biomass conversion intermediate of benzyl alcohol (BA) as an example, its oxidation potential gradually increases as the reaction proceeded, led to reduced promotion of hydrogen production. Consequently, controlling the intermediate formation during the primary oxidation of biomass derivatives is the key for this strategy to achieve the promotion of hydrogen production. We are thus interested in replacing OER with a controllable primary oxidation reaction of biomass derivatives on the anode for highly efficient hydrogen production. In the paper, the primary oxidation reaction of a biomass derivative - benzyl alcohol (BA) into benzaldehyde (BAD) is selected. It has to point out that BAD is actually a raw material and has been widely used in the fields of medicine, chemicals industry, printing and dyeing. [23,24] Therefore, the selective oxidation of BA to BAD has been tried using traditional oxidants (e.g., metal oxides, ozone, peroxides and halides) [25,26], noble metal catalysts [24,27,28], metal-free photocatalysts (mesoporous carbon nitride) [29]. Among them, some catalysts are expensive. In some cases, complicated operation conditions (e.g., high temperature and pressure) are required. [16,30,31] More seriously, there is no available catalyst systems that feature both high selectivity and fast conversion rate of the oxidation reaction of BA to BAD under mild conditions. Herein, a novel and cheap photoelectrocatalyst, based on Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles and a TiO2 nanotube array (NTA) is synthesized to realize highly selective conversion of BA to BAD. More importantly, the selectivity of the primary oxidation reaction of BA to BAD is tuned and employed to replace OER for hydrogen production. A novel solar-activated biomass photoelectrochemical cell (saBPEC) is further proposed and designed. It consists of a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode and as a photocathode constructed from the carbon-doped Cu2O nanowires (C/Cu2ONW). Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA was n-type semiconductor with suitable valence band position for the selective conversion of BA to BAD, while C/Cu2ONW was p-type semiconductor with more negative conduction band (CB) position for hydrogen production. The Fermi level of the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode was more negative than that of the C/Cu2O photocathode, an interior bias was produced and drive the electrons of Bi2MoO6@TiO2 photoanode transfer and combine with the holes of the C/Cu2O photocathode. A simulative Z-Scheme dual-photoelectrodes saBPEC was constructed, the primary oxidation of BA into BAD is tuned on the photoanode, while promoted hydrogen production is expected to be occurred on the photocathode. In this way, the captured solar energy is utilized for the efficient generation of valuable raw material - BAD from BA as well as for promoted and stable hydrogen production over a long electrolysis time. Therefore, the selectivity tuning conversion of BA into BAD (including the influence of the para-substituent of BA on the conversion ratio of BA into BAD) on the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode and the synergistic hydrogen production on the C/Cu2ONW photocathode are thus presented."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of the Bi2MoO6@TiO2 photoanode,"2.1 Synthesis of the Bi2MoO6@TiO2 photoanode A well-ordered TiO2 nanotube array (TiO2NTA) was synthesized via a three-step electrochemical anodic oxidation method. [32] The Bi2MoO6@TiO2 photocathode was synthesized via a precipitation solvothermal method (Scheme S1). [33,34] Briefly, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (196 mg) and Na2MoO4·2H2O (41.2 mg) were dispersed in ethylene glycol (7.5 mL) respectively and then stirred for 60 min. Subsequently, the second magnetic stirring for 90 min was applied to the mixture of the above two solutions. Then, the obtained mixed solution is transferred into 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave with as-prepared TiO2 NTA. The reaction temperature was set at 160 °C, while the reaction time was varied (e.g., 1, 2, 4 and 6 h) as required. After thoroughly washing as-obtained electrode with deionized water and ethanol, it was dried at 70 °C for 4 h. Such an electrode was named as a Bi2MoO6@TiO2 photocathode in this work."
3,Synthesis of the C/Cu2O photocathode,"2.2 Synthesis of the C/Cu2O photocathode A C/Cu2O photocathode was synthesized using the way reported in the literature. [35,36] In the first step, a copper mesh was sonicated in acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 30 min, respectively. After dried in N2 atmosphere, it was anodized at 25 °C in a 3 M NaOH solution for 30 min at 10 mA cm−2 current density. A conventional three-electrode system was applied, consisting of an Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode. In this way, Cu (OH)2 NWAs were grown on the surface of Cu mesh. They were further rinsed with deionized water and dried in N2 atmosphere. After that, they were immersed into a 3 g L-1 glucose solution for 60 s, then this glucose-loaded Cu(OH)2 NWs were obtained by calcining at 550 °C. The process was performed at N2 atmosphere for 4 h. The final produce was a C/Cu2O photocathode."
4,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements All photoelectrochemical tests were conducted on a CHI660C electrochemical station with a conventional three-electrode system. Ag/AgCl as reference electrode and Pt foil as counter electrodes, Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTAas working electrode. The conversion of BA was realized by in a two-electrode cell, which was connected by an external wire without any bias. A double-chamber photoelectrochemical quartz reactor with a Nafion 117 proton exchange membrane. The working areas of both electrodes were 2 cm2. Prior to such conversion, the oxygen gas was bubbled into the anode solution for40 min until the O2concentration reached saturation. Meanwhile, nitrogen gas was passed through the cathode solution to remove dissolved oxygen. The target biomass of 0.1 M BA was dissolved in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The 300 w xenon lamp (Perfect light, Microsolar 300) was used as a simulated solar light source with AM 1.5 filter. The conversion ratio of BA, the yield and selectivity of BAD from BA were calculated using the following equations: (1) Conversion (%) = [ ( C O- C r ) / C 0 ]100 % (2) Yield (%) = ( C p / C 0 )×100 % (3) Selectivity (%) = [ C p / ( C 0 - C r ) ] ×100 % where C 0 is the primary concentration of BA, C r and C p are the concentrations of left BA and BAD after a certain reaction time, respectively. The qualitative and quantitative test of hydrogen produced at the cathode was conducted via a headspace gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014C). The conversion of BA, the yield and selectivity of BAD was quantitatively performed by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1260, Agilent Co) equipped with a C18 column (4.6 × 100 nm, 3.5 mm). The test conditions were listed as follows: the wavelength (λ) of the UV detector of 254 nm, the ratio of methanol to water of 70:30, and the flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1. Additionally, the product of photoelectrochemical conversion of BA was determined by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Trace-1300 ISQ-Mass, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. USA) with capillary column (TG-5MS, 30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 μm) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, 1H NMR, Bruker AVANCE III HD 600 MHz)."
5,In situ FTIR pyridine adsorption,"2.4 In situ FTIR pyridine adsorption In the first step, the Bi2MoO6 sample was dried at 250 °C for 2 h to make the surface clean. After 20 min, using a syringe to incorporate 10 μL of pyridine into the cells through the septum. Half an hour later, the adsorption equilibrium was reached. The desorption was conducted at 150 °C. During such processes, the FTIR spectra of the sample were collected."
6,In situ ATR-FTIR benzyl alcohol adsorption,"2.5 In situ ATR-FTIR benzyl alcohol adsorption In the first step, 2 mg Bi2MoO6 was dispersed in ultra-pure water (0.5 mL). After adding 50 μL Nafion solution (5.0 wt%), the mixture was dispersed in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h. Subsequently, 20 μL mixture was drop-wisely coated on a polished silicon prism, which was further dried at 60 °C. The static adsorption experiments were carried out within 120 min, when in situ FTIR spectra were collected every 1 min."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Photoelectrochemical properties of saBPECs,"3.1 Photoelectrochemical properties of saBPECs The properties of the employed photoelectrodes and constructed saBPECs were investigated. The photovoltages of the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA, TiO2NTA and C/Cu2ONW photoelectrodes as well as as-constructed saBPECs were recorded in the dark or under the light illumination (Fig. 1 A). Their photovoltages are -0.25 V (Fig. 1A-a), -0.18 (Fig. 1A-b), and 0.075 V (Fig. 1A-c), respectively. For these measurements, a Pt sheet was used as the counter electrode. The photovoltages of the TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW (Fig. 1A-d) and Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW (Fig. 1A-e) saBPECs are 0.36 and 0.43 V, respectively. These photovoltages are steady even after 5 cycles. Note that, the photovoltages of these saBPECs are higher than the direct sums of the photovoltages of two individual photoelectrodes. It can be also inferred that the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode provides a negative bias for photocathode, but the C/Cu2ONW photocathode offers a positive bias for photoanode. There is a significant synergistic effect in the saBPEC system. More importantly, the photovoltage of a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC is higher than that of a TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC. The reason may be that the CB of TiO2NTA was more positive than Bi2MoO6, but the valance band of TiO2NTA was more positive than Bi2MoO6 as shown in Fig. S1. The formation of Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA hetero structure improves the photoelectrochemical conversion efficiency and reduces the recombination of electron and hole. The photocurrents of these photoelectrodes and as-constructed saBPECs are varied in the similar trend as their photovoltages (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the photocurrent of Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode and C/Cu2ONW photocathode were 0.22 mA cm−2 and −0.17 mA cm−2, respectively. While the Bi2MoO6@ TiO2NTA -C/Cu2ONW photocurrent was 0.58 mA cm-1, which was higher than the sum of the two (Fig. 1B). Additionally, the photocurrent of Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA (0.22 mA cm−2) is larger than TiO2NTA (0.10 mA cm−2). They remain also unchanged even after 5 cycles. The difference in photocurrents on these photoanodes results from the variation of surface morphologies of these photoelectrodes. For example, the TiO2NTA features a distinctly upright and tubular structure (Fig. 2 A). The average diameter of TiO2NTA is 120 nm and the thickness is about 30 nm. While the Bi2MoO6 displays different morphological structures. They are further changed when different solvothermal/reaction times are applied. For example, few nanoparticles are seen on the surface of the TiO2NTA when a reaction time of 1 h is applied (Fig. S2A). An increase of reaction time to 2 h (Fig. S2B) leads to the growth of bigger-sized Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles on the surface of the TiO2NTA. It is clearly observed that the Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles were closely attached to the top and side of the TiO2NTA (Fig. 2C and D). The Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles size was about 8−15 nm. The HRTEM images (Fig. 2E) reveal the lattice spacing of 0.352 and 0.31 nm, which were consisted with the lattice distances of (101) plane of anataseTiO2 and (131) plane of orthorhombic phase Bi2MoO6, respectively. When the reaction time is 4 h, the Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles completely block the pores of a TiO2NTA (Fig. S2C). When the reaction time reaches 6 h, as-grown Bi2MoO6 changes to a graded nanoflower structure (Fig. S2D). The width of this Bi2MoO6 nanoflower is 420 nm. These Bi2MoO6 nanoflowers block the TiO2NAT. In this case, only part of the light can be projected into the TiO2NTA. Consequently, its photocurrent density is low. On the other hand, the SEM image of C/Cu2ONW photocathode is shown in Fig. 2F. The nanowires showed smooth surface with no visible fractures, and the diameter of the C/Cu2ONW is around 1.2 μm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of C/Cu2ONW photocathode indicate that it is a polycrystalline structure (Fig. 2G). An EDS profile of a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA (Fig. 2H) confirms the existences of of Ti, Bi, Mo and O elements. Therefore, the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode and the C/Cu2ONW photocathode have stable photoelectrochemical response and anti-corrosive properties. Inside a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC, the electrons are expected to be transferred from the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode to the C/Cu2ONW photocathode [37,38]. The Mott-Schottky curves of the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode and the TiO2NTA photoanode were then measured at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz (Fig. 1C). As confirmed from their positive slopes, two photoanodes are n-type semiconductors (or electrons as the major carriers). The estimated flat potentials (E FB) of the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA and the TiO2NTA photoanodes are -0.34 V and -0.12 V (vs. NHE), respectively. Accordingly, the E FB of Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode is more negative than the O2/O2 − (−0.28 V vs. NHE). [39] Therefore, the easier activation of oxygen into superoxide (O2 −) radicals by photogenerated electrons is possible to be realized on the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode. The power densities (P) of the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW and TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPECs were further measured (Fig. 1D). An increase of the current density leads to the reduction of the photovoltages for both saBPECs. The Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC exhibits a slower rate of the reduction of its photovoltage than that of the TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC. Differently, a maximum P (P max) is reached within the applied current densities. For the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC, the P max is 0.082 mW cm−2, but the TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC, the P max is only 0.035 mW cm−2. This results from synergistic facilitation of the photocathode and photoanode inside this saBPEC. As an important indicator of the output performance of such saBPECs, the fill factors (FF) of a the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC were further calculated when different Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanodes were utilized (Table S1). With a solvothermal time of 2 h, the Bi2MoO6(2 h) @TiO2NTA photoanode exhibits the highest short circuit current density (J SC), the biggest open circuit voltage (V OC) and actual P max and FE. To analyze further the performance of different Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPECs, the used photoanodes were characterized using various techniques. For example, the absorption band of a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode is at 430 nm (Fig. S3A). Its UV–vis spectrum has an obvious red-shift, when compared with that of a TiO2NTA (Fig. S3A). The calculated band gap of a TiO2NTA photoanode, Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles and Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode are 3.17, 2.76 and 2.88 eV, respectively. [40] The diffraction peaks at 25.3°, 37.9°, 48.1°, and 54.1° in the XRD patterns of a TiO2NTA photoelectrode (Fig. S3B) correspond to the anatase TiO2 (101), (004), (200), and (105) facet, respectively. The characteristic peaks of 28.3°, 32.6°, 47.1° and 55.4° in the XRD patterns of Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles (Fig. S3B) are attributed to the (131), (200), (202) and (331) crystal facet of the orthogonal phase of Bi2MoO6. All these characteristic peaks for both a TiO2NTA photoanode and Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles are seen in the XRD patterns a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode (Fig. S3B), confirming the successful loading of Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles on a TiO2NTA photoanode by means of the used solvothermal method. The Raman spectra of a TiO2NTA photoanode, Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles and a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode are compared (Fig. 3 A). The Raman spectrum of Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles shows a strong band at around 800 cm−1 (A 1g mode), which is ascribed the symmetric stretch of the MoO6 octahedron. The band at 715 cm-1 (E u mode) and 841 cm−1 (A 2u mode) are assigned to asymmetric stretching vibrations of the octahedron. The modes between 290 and 370 cm−1 are originated from the E g mode bending vibration. The Raman peaks of the anatase TiO2 phase are located at 153 (E g mode), 397 (B 1g), 519 (A 1g), and 640 cm−1 (E g mode), respectively. The E g peak of this anatase TiO2 phase results from the symmetric stretching vibration of O-Ti-O, while the B 1g and A 1g peaks are attributable to the symmetric bending vibration and asymmetric bending vibration of O-Ti-O, respectively. The chemical compositions and element valences of the TiO2NTA and Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanodes were further estimated by XPS. The comparison of their full XPS survey spectra clearly indicates the introduction of additional Bi and Mo elements into a TiO2NTA photoanode, namely the formation of a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA (Fig. 3B). The two peaks of 158.9 and 164.2 eV in a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode (Fig. 3C) are attributed to the binding energies of Bi4f 7/2 and Bi4f 5/2, respectively. Two different peaks appeared at 231.8 eV and 235.0 eV (Fig. 3D) are attributed to Mo3d 5/2 and Mo3d 3/2 of MoO4 2-, respectively. [33,34,41] The peaks of Ti 2p at the binding energies of 458.4 and 465.9 eV (Fig. 3E) are assigned to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. The peaks of the O1s spectra at 529.4 and 531.1 eV (Fig. 3F) are owing to the lattice oxygen and the bridged hydroxyl groups, respectively. Consequently, the Bi2MoO6(2 h) @TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC features excellent photoelectrochemical activities and was thus utilized for controllable and selective conversion of BA into BAD."
9,Primary oxidation of BA in the saBPECs,"3.2 Primary oxidation of BA in the saBPECs The selective oxidation of BA into BAD was firstly conducted in the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW and TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPECs under an anerobic condition. Table 1 summarizes the performance of these saBPECs. The highest current density (J 0), the conversion ratio, and the selectivity of BA into BAD have been measured to characterize the performance of the used photoanode, while the amount/yield of produced hydrogen and the calculated efficiency of hydrogen production (H2 efficiency) have been utilized to characterize the performance of the used photocathode. Inside two saBPECs, the highest current densities (J 0) are similar, leading to quite close conversation ratio. On the other hand, the J 0 values, the conversion ratio and selectivity of BA into BAD as well as the amount and the efficiencies of hydrogen production were estimated under an aerobic condition. Namely, oxygen was further purged into the solutions for these tests. This is because oxygen is assumed to be adsorbed on the Bi2MoO6 surface and further activated into the O2 − radicals by the photogenerated electrons on the photoanode. Such radicals accelerate direct and the conversion of BA to BAD. [42] As expected, the highest values were achieved in the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under the same conditions. For example, with an electrolysis time of 8 h, a highest current density of 0.54 mA cm−2, a conversion ratio of 67.4 %, and the selectivity of 98.6 % are achieved. Here, the conversion ratio is defined by the ratio of the concentration of generated BAD (C p) to that of initial BA concentration (C 0). The selectivity is defined by the ratio of C p to that of the different of C 0 from the rest BA (C r), namely converted BA (C 0 - C r). As control experiments, the yield of hydrogen production was estimated in a blank Na2SO4 solution (namely without the addition of BA), which is 5.5-times smaller than the maximum one (114.6 μm cm-2) obtained in a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC. Moreover, the highest efficiency of hydrogen production (85 %) is realized in this saBPEC. Additionally, the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW system shows good behavior of photoelectrochemical selective conversion of BA to BAD and simultaneous hydrogen production compared with the recent literatures. (Table 2 ). Consequently, the oxidation of BA on a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode effectively promotes hydrogen production on the C/Cu2ONW photocathode. The HPLC spectra of a BA solution after being electrolyzed with different electrolysis time were recorded (Fig. 4 A). Clearly, the BA concentration is reduced while the concentration of generated BAD is enhanced as a function of electrolysis time. For most measurements in this paper, an electrolysis time of 8 h was applied. Moreover, HPLC for a long time operation was recorded, and no other new peaks appeared except for BA and BAD (as shown in Fig. S4A). The GC peaks of 6.9 and 8.1 min were attributed to BAD and BA, respectively, which were further determined by MS (Fig. S4B). The NMR showed the same result, and no other by-products were produced (Fig. S4C). For comparison, such experiments were also conducted in other saBPECs under an aerobic or anerobic condition. The conversion ratio of BA into BAD and the production ratio of BAD on these photoanodes were calculated at different electrolysis times (Fig. 4B). At a fixed electrolysis time, the C r/C 0 value is reduced but the C p/C 0 value increases when a longer electrolysis time is applied. For a fixed time, the magnitudes of the C r/C 0 values are in the order of a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-Pt saBPEC under an aerobic condition > a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an anerobic condition > a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an aerobic condition > a TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an aerobic condition. The order of the magnitudes of the C p/C 0 values are different: a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an aerobic condition > a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-Pt saBPEC under an aerobic condition > a TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an aerobic condition > a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an anerobic condition. The yields/amounts of produced hydrogen were also calculated (Fig. 4C). At one fixed electrolysis time, the hydrogen yield follows the order of a Bi2MoO6@TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an aerobic condition > a TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an aerobic condition > a Bi2MoO6@ TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an anerobic condition > a TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPECs under an anaerobic condition > a Bi2MoO6@TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an aerobic condition but without the addition of BA. For example, at an electrolysis time of 8 h, the yield of produced hydrogen is 114.6 μmol cm−2 in a Bi2MoO6@ TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC, which is 3.3 times higher than that in a Bi2MoO6@ TiO 2 NTA-Pt saBPEC and 5.5 times higher than that (20.7 μmol cm−2) in a Bi2MoO6@ TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an aerobic condition but without the addition of BA. Note that, the biggest efficiency of produced hydrogen was achieved in the Bi2MoO6 (2 h)@TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC. The effect of added different substrates on hydrogen production was also explored in the Bi2MoO6@TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC for 8 h (Fig. 4D and Table 3 ). The addition of BA, furfuryl alcohol (FFA) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) enhances the hydrogen production. Interestingly, a higher selectivity (97.8 %) of FFA to FF was obtained in this saBPEC system. The conversion of BA (67.4 %) with a C/Cu2ONW catalyst as the photocathode was higher than that with a Pt sheet (43.1 %) under the same conditions. Therefore, the construction of the proposed saBPEC not only promotes the production of green energy source – hydrogen, but also enhances the conversion of BA into BAD, one valuable raw material. The influence of different substituent groups inside BA molecules (para-structures) on the conversion rate, selectivity and hydrogen production was also investigated (Fig. 4E and Table 3). For these rests, electron donating groups (e.g., OCH3, CH3) and electron withdrawing groups (e.g., F, NO2) were introduced into the para position of BA molecules [28,49]. It was obvious that high selectivity is obtained of all the benzyl alcohol derivatives to corresponding aldehyde, but the conversion rate is slightly different (as shown in Table 3). It was speculated that *C6H5−CH2OH+ as the main intermediate. So the electron donating ability of the substituent can affect the selective conversion of benzyl alcohol derivatives. Methoxy has the electron-withdraw inductive effect and the electron-donating conjugation, but the conjugation effect of donating electrons is dominant due to the lone pair electrons of oxygen. So it is the electron-donating group, which can enhance the electron cloud density of benzyl intermediate and it is easier to activate CH bond. The electron donating group is more conducive to the formation of *C6H5 CH2OH+ intermediates. Therefore, the conversion ratio of 4-Methoxybenzyl alcohol was larger than BA. On the contrary, the nitro has strong electron-withdraw inductive effect and conjugation, and it decrease the electron cloud density of benzyl intermediate. The stronger the electron donating ability of the para substituent is, the higher the conversion rate, following the order: OCH3>CH3>H>F>NO2. Hydrogen production follows the same trend. The selectivity of BA into BAD was then calculated at different electrolysis time for all these processes (Fig. S4D). For each saBPEC, the value of this selectivity keep constant within the applied electrolysis time. The selectivity of BA into BAD is 98.6 % for both Bi2MoO6@TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW and Bi2MoO6@TiO 2 NTA-Pt saBPECs under an aerobic condition. In contrast, it is only 58.4 % and 46.2 % for the TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC and Bi2MoO6@TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPECs under an anerobic condition (Fig. 4F), respectively. Therefore, the selectivity of primary oxidation of BA into BAD can be tuned as required. A Bi2MoO6@TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC exhibits the highest primary oxidation selectivity for the BA conversion into BAD as well as the highest efficiency for hydrogen production under an anerobic condition."
10,Mechanism of promoted hydrogen production by selective primary BA oxidation,"3.3 Mechanism of promoted hydrogen production by selective primary BA oxidation To get insight into the mechanism of the promoted hydrogen production by this selective primary BA oxidation, the improved conversion efficiencies of BA into BAD were further analyzed. Firstly, the static adsorption behavior of BA on the TiO2NTA and Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanodes was examined. The Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode adsorbs 15.4 % of 0.1 mM BA within 90 min, which is only 11.6 % for a TiO2NTA photoanode (Fig. 5 A). BA is actually a Lewis base, because of the lone pair electrons of hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the interaction between BA and a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode is enhanced, leading to more adsorbed BA molecules on a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode. The presence of Lewis acid site on the Bi2MoO6 surface was further measured via in-situ FTIR of vacuum adsorbed pyridine (Fig. 5B), where the sites of Lewis acid are found on the Bi2MoO6 surface. For example, the characteristic peaks at 1449 and 1538 cm−1 correspond to the Lewis acid sites and Bransted acid sites on which pyridine adsorbed, respectively. The Bransted acid on the surface of Bi2MoO6 may be derived from the hydrogen atom on the surface hydroxyl group, while the Lewis acid is mainly derived from the Mo atom. [50] The active sites for the BA adsorption on the Bi2MoO6 surface was further tested by means of in situ FTIR ATR (attenuated total reflection) (Fig. 5C). An increase of the illumination time (e.g., from 0 to 120 min) leads to the enhancement of the peak at 1017 and 1460 cm−1, it can be attributed to stretching vibration of the CO band and the deformation vibration of CH2 inside a BA molecule, respectively. These intensities of these peaks gradually increase with a longer electrolysis time. Due to the existence of the site of Lewis acid on the Bi2MoO6 surface, a much stronger adsorption capacity of BA is exhibited on the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode than that on a TiO2NTA photoanode. The enhanced BA adsorption on a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode eventually enhances the conversion of BA into BAD. On the other hand, the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode is a heterojunction since it has enhanced photoelectrochemical performance (e.g., improved photocurrent and photovoltage), an optimal conductivity, and a fast electron transfer process. For example, the loading amount of Bi2MoO6 during the hydrothermal process affects the photoelectrochemical response (Table S1 and Fig. S5A) and electrochemical properties (Fig. S5B) of the as-formed Bi2MoO6@ TiO 2 NTA photoanodes. As confirmed previously, a Bi2MoO6(2 h) @TiO 2 NTA photoanode exhibits the best photoelectrochemical performance and a fastest electron transfer process. To explore the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode, its V OC was measured as a function of time. In this way, the photoelectron lifetime of this photoanode was determined together the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [51,52]. From the variation of V OC as a function of time under irradiation and in the dark (Fig. S6A), the photoelectron lifetimes of the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA and TiO2NTA photoelectrodes were calculated (Fig. S6B). The Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode exhibits a remarkably prolonged electron lifetime and an enhanced photovoltage, when compared with those of a TiO2NTA photoanode. Consequently, the recombination of photogenerated hole-electron pairs is efficiently suppressed on a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode, leading good stability and cycling stability of a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC for hydrogen production and BA conversion (Fig. S7). Very importantly, a higher conversion ratio (67.4 %) and selectivity (98.6 %) for primary oxidation of BA to BAD were achieved in the Bi2MoO6@ TiO 2 NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC under an aerobic condition than an anaerobic condition (conversion, 48.2 %; selectivity, 46.2 %). In other words, the purged oxygen plays a key role in the selective conversion of BA to BAD. Since the sites of Lewis base are also existed on the Bi2MoO6 surface, a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode was also characterized with the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) technique and CO2 as the probe molecule (Fig. 5D). Its CO2-TPD spectrum displays a much higher signal intensity at 382 °C. This indicates a strong alkaline center existed on the Bi2MoO6 surface, which may originate from the Bi atoms. Meanwhile, it is known that the sites of Lewis base on the surface efficiently adsorbs and activates O2. and it can be reduced to superoxide radicals by phot ogenerated electrons from a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode, leading to efficient and highly selective primary oxidation of BA into BAD [53]. Surprisingly, the conversion ratio (67.4 %) of BA into BAD on a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode is lower than that (69.2 %) on a TiO2NTA photoanode. To figure out the reason for such a result, the spin-trapping EPR analysis was employed to identify the short-lived radicals generated on these photoanodes (Fig. 5E). The DMPO −OH compound is detected on the TiO2NTA photoanode. In contrast, the DMPO −OH product is not detectable on the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode. Owing to the strong oxidizing properties of hydroxyl radical, the conversion ratio of BA on TiO2NTA photoanode (69.2 %) is upper than Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode (67.4 %), but the selectivity of the conversion of BA into BAD on a TiO2NTA photoanode is only 58.4 %, which is lower than Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode (98.6 %). On the other hand, nonselective hydroxyl radical are not involved on a Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode, explaining well much improved selectivity (98.6 %) of the conversion of BA into BAD. The mechanism of selective primary BA oxidation into BAD is then proposed as follows (Fig. 5F). The tubular structure of TiO2NTA can further enhance the refraction of light and improve the utilization rate of light. Meanwhile, it can provide significantly shorter carrier-diffusion paths along the tube walls for efficient charge transfer. Additionally, TiO2NTA were grown in situ on Ti sheet by anodization, which can be used as an excellent substrate material for loading Bi2MoO6, to form Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA hetero structure. Moreover, the Bi2MoO6 can effectively regulate the valance band (VB) of TiO2NTA and the VB of Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA was 2.44 V (vs. NHE), which is positive than BA/BAD (1.98 V vs. NHE) [54]. Additionally, the surface of Bi2MoO6 with abundant Lewis acid sites, which can effectively absorb BA. The adsorbed BA on the surface of the Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode is oxidized and BA active anion (namely *C6H5−CH2OH+) is generated (on base of the oxidation of the hole). The Lewis base sites were presented on the surface of Bi2MoO6, which can effectively adsorb and activate oxygen to O2 − radicals by these photo generated electrons. With these weak oxidants of O2 - radicals, the further oxidization of generated C6H5−CH2OH+ into BAD is achieved at a high efficiency, namely resulting in the realization of highly selective oxidation of BA to BAD [42,55]. The possible mechanism of promoted hydrogen production by selective BA conversion is hypothesized as follows. The photogenerated electron-hole pairs are generated simultaneously at the photoanode and photocathode under illumination. Since the difference of Fermi level of Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode and C/Cu2ONW photocathode, an interior bias is formed and it can drive the electrons of Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA photoanode to C/Cu2ONW photocathode and combine with the holes [35,37]. A simulative Z-Scheme structure is thus established for the selective oxidation of BA into BAD at photoanode and the reduction of the protons to produce hydrogen at photocathode, respectively. The production of green energy source - hydrogen and the highly selective conversion of BA into BAD - one valuable raw material is thus much favorable in the as-proposed Bi2MoO6@TiO2NTA-C/Cu2ONW saBPEC. The effect of the selectivity of this primary oxidation of BA into BAD at the photoanode on the promoted hydrogen production at the photocathode was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 6 , BA can be primarily oxidized into BAD with the involvement of two electrons. As a second oxidation step, BAD can be oxidized into benzoic acid (BZA). In the third oxidation step, BZA can be decomposed into CO2. Therefore, the polarization curves of 0.1 M BA, BAD and BZA were recorded in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. The yields and the amount of produced hydrogen were examined. Note here that, for these tests, an illumination time of 4 h was applied and a TiO2NTA photoanode was selected. This is because a lower selectivity for BAD (e.g., 58.4 %) was obtained under these conditions, when compared with that obtained using other photoanodes. In 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution, no redox waves are seen in the scan potential range. The addition of BA (Fig. 6A) or BAD (Fig. 6B) leads to the appearance of one pronounced anodic peak potential. This is probably because both oxidations reactions only involve two electrons. However, this oxidation peak appeared in the BA solution is much sharper and its current density is much higher than that shown up in the BAD solution. In short, the primary oxidation of BA into BAD is easier than the second oxidation of BAD into BZA. The addition of BZA (Fig. 6C) makes the anodic wave totally appear since BZA is difficult to be oxidized. This is because for this reaction 30 electrons are required. Consequently, only very limited amout of BAD can be further oxidized into BZA. To examine these oxidation reactions in a quantitative way, the conversion ratio for three oxidation steps as well as the yields of generated hydrogen during these oxidation steps were calculated (Fig. 6D). In the BA solution, the conversion ratio is 53.4 %. It is 1.8 times higher than that (29.5 %) in the BAD solution and 4.2 times higher than that (12.6 %) in the BZA solution. On other hand, the amount of produced hydrogen is 56.5 μmol cm−2 in the BA solution, which is higher than that of the BAD and BZA solutions. Clearly, the primary oxidation of BA into BAD plays the key role to determine the amount of hydrogen produced on the photocathode. Namely, the primary oxidation of BA into BAD with high selectivity is favorable to promote hydrogen production or generate more hydrogen."
11,Conclusion,"The primary oxidation reaction of biomass derivatives has been employed to replace the OER during electrochemical water spilling. In a solar-activated biomass photoelectrochemical cell, nearly 100 % BA has been selectively converted into BAD on the photoanode and meanwhile hydrogen production with a Faradaic efficiency of 85 % has been realized. Such excellent performance of this photoelectrochemical cell is due to the synergistic effect of saBPEC system and the tuned selectivity of this primary oxidation reaction. The existence active sites of Lewis acid and base on the Bi2MoO6 surface leads to a much stronger ability to adsorb BA and activate O2. The primary oxidation of BA synergistically promotes the most efficiently hydrogen production. The proposed strategy combines solar energy and biomass for the efficient production of the valuable raw material - benzaldehyde as well as green energy source - hydrogen. Such a solar-activated biomass photoelectrochemical cell thus paves new ways to synthesize raw materials and to produce energy materials within a green and efficient energy recycling circle."
