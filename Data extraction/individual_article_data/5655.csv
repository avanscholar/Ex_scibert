0,Introduction,"Thermochemical conversion (combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis) is a common technology for the conversion of coal into other energy sources. In addition, coal gasification is an important way to achieve environmental protection, energy conservation, and emission reduction. At present, there are two methods for coal gasification including high temperature pyrolysis gasification and biological gasification at room temperature. Different pyrolysis processes occur at different temperatures, heating rates, and pressures to produce products such as gas, tar, semi-coke or coke; however, in this process, various greenhouse gases and volatile toxic elements are emitted, causing a series of environmental problems. Coal biogasification is based on coal as a carbon source, and it undergoes complex biochemical metabolism of microbial communities at room temperature to finally form methane-based gas (Su et al., 2018), with lot of potential advantages such as safety, low conversion cost, environmental friendliness, and low energy consumption over coal pyrolysis and gasification. (Fallgren et al., 2013; Hosseini and Wahid, 2013; Scott, 1999). However, the poor bioavailability of organic matter structures such as benzene, alicyclic, and heterocyclic structures in coal severely limits methane production rates and yields (Gallagher et al., 2013). At present, coal is mainly pretreated by physical, chemical or biological methods to increase biomethane production, but these methods also cause secondary pollution of the environment (Cai and Wang, 2016). In addition, the lower H/C ratio in coal is still the main reason, limiting the increase of biomethane production (Guo et al., 2018). Straw biomass is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, with high H/C, as well as the advantage of availability and low cost, and the serious environmental problems caused by traditional extensive combustion. Straw and coal as the mixed substrate of fermentation can solve the problem for imbalance of H/C ratio and significantly improve the biomethane production (Gu et al., 2015). However, the crystallinity of cellulose and the complexity of covalent crosslinking between lignin and hemicellulose through ester bond and ether bond in plant cell walls make lignocellulose biomass resistant to biodegradation (Jonsson and Martin, 2016). A few reports have studied combined fermentation of corn straw with coal and reported high degradation rate of cellulose and hemicellulose in biomass to reach 29.82% and 35.79%. Also, higher methane production was generated by the combined fermentation of coal and straw, with better optimized bacterial and archaea community structure (Yoon et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2020a, 2020b). The methane metabolism during anaerobic fermentation of coal and straw is a dominant process of organic matter degradation and biogas production. It is thus important to explore the metabolic characteristics of bacteria and archaea communities during methane production. The metabolic pathways in the process of anaerobic digestion of organic matter have been studied in the past. For example, during the anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste, methane production from acetate is more competitive than that from CO2/H2 (Ma et al., 2020). At the same time, symbiotic relationship between some bacteria and methanogens has also been observed. For example, acetate is oxidized to H2 and CO2 by syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria, which is then used for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Ghosh et al., 2020). In addition, enzymes also play a key role in organic matter metabolism. Fructose bisphosphate aldolase is a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway resulting in the degradation of fructose 1, 6-diphosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate (Montero-Blay et al., 2020). Enzymes GTW28_09400 and GTW28_13725 can hydrolyze the single ester bond of phthalate esters, while GTW28_17760 can hydrolyze the di-ester bonds of phthalate esters. Through molecular docking, it may affect the enzymatic ester bond hydrolysis of mono-butyl phthalate of GTW28_17760 (Xu et al., 2021). Therefore, based on the importance of metabolic pathways for the efficient methane production by co-fermentation of coal and biomass, it is of utmost importance to monitor the microbial dynamics in the co-fermentation process, and to analyze the metabolic pathways, so as to maximize the methane production by enhancing the activity of key genera. In this study, three coal samples were selected for the co-fermentation experiment with corn straw. First, the fermentation broth was analyzed by three-dimensional fluorescence and Gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC–MS), and the lignocellulosic structure of corn straw was analyzed by 13C NMR method. Thereafter, the microbial metabolic pathways were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The changes in lignocellulosic structure, liquid products, microbial community structure and functional gene characteristics of methane metabolism in the fermentation system were focused. The results help in the identification of the mechanism of methane production by anaerobic fermentation of coal combined with biomass, and helps in exploring the methane metabolic pathway."

2,Samples collection,"2.1 Samples collection Bituminous coal A (Wangjialing mine in Yuncheng, Shanxi Province, China), bituminous coal B (Shoushan No.1 mine in Pingdingshan, Henan Province, China), and bituminous coal C (Meiyukou mine in Datong, Shanxi Province, China) were used for the biological gas production experiments. Corn straw was collected from Jiaozuo, Henan Province. The ultimate and proximate analyses were carried out according to ISO 17247–2013 and ISO 17246–2010, respectively (Table 1 )."
3,Enrichment culture of methanogens,"2.2 Enrichment culture of methanogens The indigenous microbes were extracted from coal seam and were acclimatized for many generations. The composition of the enrichment culture for methanogens domestication was as follows: 0.4 g K2HPO4, 0.1 g MgCl2, 0.2 g KH2PO4, 1.0 g yeast, 0.1 g tryptone, 1.0 g NH4Cl, 0.5 g cysteine, 0.2 g Na2S, 2 g NaHCO3, 0.5 g sodium acetate, 0.5 g sodium formate, and 10 mL trace element solution added to 1000 mL distilled water. The trace element solution contained the following: 1.5 g triglycolamic acid, 0.5 g MnSO4·2H2O, 3.0 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g FeSO4·7H2O, 1.0 g NaCl, 0.1 g CoCl2·6H2O, 0.1 g CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01 g CuSO4·5H2O, 0.1 g ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g H3BO3, 0.01 g KAl(SO4)2, 0.02 g NiCl2·6H2O, and 0.01 g Na2MoO4 added to 1000 mL distilled water."
4,Experimental methods,"2.3 Experimental methods 2.3.1 Biomethane production from coal and corn straw The prepared medium was sterilized for 3 h at 121 °C. The sterilized medium was poured into the acclimatized fermentation liquid in an anaerobic workstation. It was then sealed using a sealing film, and was allowed to enrich in a constant temperature incubator at 35 °C for 4 days. The coal samples were crushed using 80–100 mesh, and the corn straws were crushed using 30 mesh. In the anaerobic workstation, each group of samples, as mentioned in Table 2 , was taken into 250 mL conical flasks, and 200 mL fermentation solution that had been cultured for 4 days was added to each flask. The air in the flask was displaced by N2 for 3 min, and the gas production experiment was carried out in a 35 °C constant temperature incubator. The gas was collected using a gas collecting bag, and the total amount of gas as well as gas composition was quantitatively analyzed. 2.3.2 Analyzing liquid products The liquid phase products, collected at different fermentation periods, were quantitatively analyzed using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Agilent GC–MS 7890-5977A, USA). For this, liquid–liquid extraction of fermentation broth was conducted using CH2Cl2 as extractant. The extraction solution was dried using nitrogen, dissolved with 2 mL of CH2Cl2, and thereafter again dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. The extract obtained was analyzed via GC–MS. The instrument was equipped with a FFAP chromatographic column (30 m × 0.25 μm × 0.5 mm) with a non-split injection, an inlet temperature of 250 °C, a high purity helium carrier gas and a column flow rate of 1 mL/min. The ionization mode was EI source, the electron energy was 70 eV, the ion source temperature was 230 °C, and the scanning range was 33.00–550.00 amu. Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to obtain the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum of the fermentation broth after diluting it to 60 times. The test results could characterize the physical and chemical characteristics of dissolved organic matters (DOM), such as their source and structure. The light source was 150 W xenon lamp. The voltage of the photomultiplier tube was 700 V. The width of the excitation and emission slits was both 10 nm. The scanning speed was 1200 nm/min. The wavelength range and step length of the excitation light were 200–400 nm and 2 nm, respectively. The wavelength range and step length of the emission light were 240–600 nm and 5 nm, respectively. The Raman scattering was corrected with ultrapure water. 2.3.3 Analysis using 13C NMR JNM-ECZR series nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (JEOL, Japanese) was used to analyze the nuclear magnetic resonance of corn straw samples before and after gas production. The resolution was 0.1 Hz. The signal-to-noise ratio was 500. The proton working frequency was 300–920 MHz. The frequency range of the radio frequency channel was 9–1000 MHz. The radio frequency power was 100 W/300 W, and the frequency setting accuracy was 0.001 Hz. 2.3.4 Analyzing microbial structure and function The total genomic DNA of bacteria and archaea in fermentation broth was extracted by rapid DNA rotary extraction kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA). Next, the quantity and quality of the extracted DNA were determined by NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. PCR amplification was performed using the 16S rRNA specific primers 338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGAGGCAGCA-3′) in the V3 region, and 806R (5′-TTWAGTCAGCAACGAGC-3′) in the V4 region of bacteria, and by using the 16S rRNA specific primers 1106F (5′-TTWAGTCAGCAACGAGC-3′) in the V8 region, and 1378R (5′-TGTGCAAGGAGCAGGGAC-3′) in the V9 region of the archaea. NEB Q5 DNA polymerase was used for the PCR. Amplification results were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, the target fragment was cut and recovered by Axygen gel recovery kit. Agencourt AMPure Beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) were used to purify the amplification products. PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to quantify the PCR products on Microplate reader (BioTek, FLx800). The samples were mixed according to the amount of data required for each sample. The samples were delivered to Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd for database construction. MiSeq Reagent Kit V3 (600cycles) was used for 2 × 300 bp double-end sequencing on the MiSeq machine. Alpha diversity index of OTU level, such as Chao1 richness estimate, Shannon diversity index and Simpson index, were calculated using the OTU table of QIIME. The microbial function was predicted by PICRUSt software (community phylogenetic investigation was conducted by reconstructing the unobserved state). Based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) methane metabolic pathway (Map: 00680), the metabolic genes with predicted abundance greater than 100 were selected for further evaluation of their cellulose degradation function and three methane generation pathways: hydrogen nutrition, methyl nutrition and acetic acid nutrition.

5,Results and discussion,
6,Gas production characteristics from combined fermentation of coal and corn straw,"3.1 Gas production characteristics from combined fermentation of coal and corn straw The co-fermentation of corn straw and coal lasted for 30 days. The results (Table 3 ) showed that an increase in the mass proportion of coal sample resulted in varying amount of gas production. The samples AC-2, BC-3 and CC-2 showed highest cumulative gas production of 234 mL, 287 mL and 226 mL, respectively. At the same time, the methane production of AC-2 was the highest, and that of BC-3 and CC-2 decreased subsequently, reaching 17.28 mL/g, 14.88 mL/g and 12.51 mL/g, respectively. CO2 concentration of the gas produced by the fermentation process is an important indicator that directly reflects the hydrolysis efficiency of anaerobic digestion. During the initial stage of anaerobic fermentation, the CO2 concentration of AC-2, BC-3 and CC-2 increased rapidly, and reached the peak at the 6th day, with values 70.11%, 61.41% and 72.59%, respectively. The CO2 concentration in the gas produced by other samples increased slowly, and the peak time was not the same. While, CC-4 reached the peak CO2 concentration (19.08%) on the 9th day of fermentation, BC-2 was the last to reach the peak CO2 concentration (6.35%) on the 21th day of fermentation. As the CO2 concentration of each gas production combination reaches its peak, it indicates a transition point from the efficient hydrolysis stage to the methane production stage. At the same time, sufficient CO2 in the fermentation system indirectly reflects strong microbial activity and high organic matter degradation. The high CO2 concentrations produced by AC-2, BC-3 and CC-2 reflect their ability to produce highest amount of methane among the other samples. To identify the metabolic process of combined fermentation of coal and corn straw for biogas production, the gas–liquid-solid three-phase products and microbial community structure of the optimal gas production combinations (AC-2, BC-3 and CC-2) were analyzed in the early fermentation (AC-2(E), BC-3(E) and CC-2(E)), peak fermentation (AC-2(P), BC-3(P) and CC-2(P)) and terminal fermentation (AC-2(T), BC-3(T) and CC-2(T)) samples."
7,Structural changes of lignocellulose,"3.2 Structural changes of lignocellulose The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the raw corn straw as well as corn straw collected after co-fermentation was analyzed. The aliphatic carbon peak groups with 60–95 chemical shifts and aromatic carbon peak groups with 100–115 chemical shifts are cellulose structures. The aliphatic carbon peak groups with 50–95 chemical shifts and aromatic carbon peak groups with 100–120 chemical shifts are hemicellulose structures. The aliphatic carbon peak groups with 0–100 chemical shifts and aromatic carbon peak groups with 100–160 chemical shifts are lignin structures (Cao et al., 2016). The shape of absorption band of all corn straw samples was similar. The –OCH3 absorption peak intensity of corn straw residue was weaker than that of the raw corn straw, which indicated that the demethoxylation of C3 and C5 occurred on the benzene ring of straw. The absorption peak intensity of corn straw samples from AC-2(T) decreased, which illustrated that the degradation degree of benzene ring structure of the corn straw was the highest under the action of microorganisms. Microbial degradation destructs β-aryl ether bond of corn straw, breaking C–C bond of side chain of lignin monomer, and weakening of C-α, C-β and C-γ peaks in β-O-4 structure. The same was the peak strength of corn straw from AC-2(T) which was still the lowest, but its degradation degree of lignin structure was largest (Zhang, 2014). These changes indicate that hydrogen bonds in cellulose crystal structure were destroyed, and cellulose crystallinity in corn straw decreased. The break-down of β-aromatic ether derivatives into guaiacol and syringyl structures increased peak intensity of guaiacol and syringyl units (Wang et al., 2017). It was observed in the current study that the peak intensity of guaiacol unit and syringyl units was higher in the corn straw sample from AC-2(T) than that in the raw straw sample. According to the characteristics of comprehensive NMR spectra, at the end of gas production, the AC-2 corn straw sample had the lowest peak in the biodegradable chemical shift fraction and the highest peak in the chemical shift fraction where new product was generated after degradation. This confirmed the highest rate of biodegradation in AC-2. The highest methane yield of AC-2 corroborated the feasibility of co-fermentation of bituminous coal A with corn straw for biogas production."
8,Analysis of liquid products,"3.3 Analysis of liquid products 3.3.1 Analysis of dissolved organic matter During the early period of co-fermentation process, similar organic composition was observed in the three fermentation systems, with respect to the biodegradable tyrosine-like proteins (Ex/Em 220–230/350 nm) and soluble microbial by-products (Ex/Em 275–285/350 nm) (Yu et al., 2019; Wu and Song, 2021). The intensity of two fluorescence peaks showed an increasing trend with decreasing coal rank in the substrate. The result shows that the content of biodegradable substrate increased in the co-fermentation process of low-rank coal and corn straw. But with the extension of fermentation time, these two fluorescence peaks disappeared in AC-2(T) and BC-3(T), indicating that most of the biodegradable products were rapidly utilized by anaerobes. However, the biodegradable organic products were still detected in CC-2(P) and disappeared at the end of the co-fermentation experiment. During the early fermentation stage, a large amount of remaining biodegradable materials showed lower methane production, which may be due to the inhibitory effect of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) on anaerobic microorganisms. In order to better reflect the changes in specific liquid products, the metabolites of different periods were tested by GC–MS. It was observed that the main liquid products of AC-2 fermentation were long chain alkanes and their substitutes, while the major products detected were ethers, esters, oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing organic compounds in BC-3. On the other hand, higher amount of VFAs were detected in CC-2. These results were also confirmed by the three-dimensional fluorescence measurement. 3.3.2 Degradation of lignocellulose and phenol There are a large number of phenolic compounds in coal, and lignocellulose is the main component of corn straw. Therefore, the use of KEGG database is crucial for the hydrolysis function analysis of the degradation of lignocellulose and phenol during the fermentation. The related degradation genes and their functional abundance were shown in Table 4 . The results showed that the degradation ratio of lignin and phenol was 12.39%–32.59%, while the relative abundance of lignin and phenol degradation in AC-2(P) was the highest, and the main degradation enzymes were aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (K00055, EC: 1.1.1.90) and acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (K00626, EC: 2.3.1.9). Aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase can reduce aromatic compounds in lignin to low molecular weight intermediates (Muheim et al., 1991). The Acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase has been used for the transformation of aromatic compounds through benzoate degradation with co-enzyme A ligases. This enzyme transforms acetyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA, which can be converted into organic acids and alcohols (Stim-Herndon et al., 1995). The content of acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase in AC-2 is highest than BC-3 and CC-2. As also observed in the above liquid phase analysis results, the abundance of benzoate (peak18) in AC-2(E) was the highest, and its content decreased significantly in AC-2(P), indicating that the results were consistent. In the microbial consortium, the most important metabolism was cellulose and hemicellulose degradation. Here, K01188 and K01811 corresponded to beta-glucosidase (EC: 3.2.1.21) and alpha-D-xyloside xylohydrolase (EC: 3.2.1.177), respectively. Both enzymes were glycoside hydrolases, with beta-glucosidase acting on carbohydrates to produce glucose and other monosaccharides (Yang et al., 2013). The other enzyme alpha-D-xyloside xylohydrolase mainly metabolizes galactomannan from hemicellulose (Aburaya et al., 2015). In corn straw, the micro-units of cellulose are surrounded by hemicellulose, followed by the sheath shrinkage of lignin layer (Moniz et al., 2015), and there is physical connection (hydrogen bond) between some hemicelluloses and lignin. The abundant content of dehydrogenase in AC-2(P) can break the physical connection between hemicellulose and lignin (Table 4), thereby increasing the contact surface between microorganisms, and cellulose and hemicellulose. This increases the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose in the late stage of fermentation, which was consistent with the NMR results."
9,Microbial diversity and succession,"3.4 Microbial diversity and succession 3.4.1 Analysis of microbial diversity 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced by high-throughput sequencing to determine microbial diversity in the fermentation broth of different samples. CK refers to the control fermentation broth without coal and corn straw. About 823,799 original bacterial sequences and 396,688 original archaea sequences were extracted from all fermentation broths, and after quality control and filtering, an average of 48471.4 effective bacterial sequences and 32,525 effective archaeal sequences were analyzed. All of the OTUs were clustered at the setting cut-off point of 0.03 (97% similarity), a total of 5272 OTUs corresponding to bacteria and 343 OTUs corresponding to archaea were produced. The community coverage of observed OTUs suspension was 0.999. The rarefaction curves were clear asymptotic lines, which suggested that the number of sequences were enough to reach the immersion state. There were 59 bacterial OTUs and 61 archaea OTUs shared among the microbial community of ten samples (Fig. 1 (a) and (b)). As shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), in the three experimental groups, the diversity index of bacterial alpha such as Chao1, Shannon and Simpson reached the maximum at the end of gas production, but in AC-2(P) and BC-3(P), the diversity index of Archaea continued to decline. Opposite trend was observed with CC-2(P). Thus, it can be concluded that the archaeal communities are more susceptible to coal rank than bacterial communities. 3.4.2 Succession analysis of microbial community (1) Bacterial community structure The community differences of bacteria and archaea in the co-fermentation broth of different coals and corn straw were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The four dominant phyla observed were Spirochaetes (7.45–54.80%), Firmicutes (9.22–51.98%), Bacteroidetes (11.21–46.52%) and Synergistetes (0.78–24.42%). The test results showed that the bacterial community structure under different substrate fermentation was quite different. Spirochaetes is chiefly involved in the degradation of carbohydrates to produce ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, hydrogen and carbon dioxide (Dong et al., 2018), while Bacteroidetes is primarily involved in the degradation of macromolecular substances such as cellulose to produce formic acid, hydrogen and carbon dioxide (Harrison and Hansen, 1963). Compared with CK, the content of these two bacteria increased significantly when the different substrates were added. In addition, the proportion of Spirochaetes increased with the increase of coal rank, but the distribution of Bacteroidetes was inversely proportional to coal rank. Remarkably, Firmicutes was observed to be a common bacterial phylum that degrades macromolecules, and is principally involved in the production of some mixed acids, alcohols and neutral substances (Treu et al., 2016). The proportion of Firmicutes decreased after the addition of fermentation substrate, and then regained strong activity at the end of fermentation, probably due to its strong dependence on fermentation substrates. In order to illustrate the function of bacterial community structure, the distribution characteristics of bacterial genera are shown in Fig. 3 (a). The results showed that two dominant bacteria observed in the fermentation broth of CK sample were Sphaerochaeta and Proteiniphilum, while Proteiniphilum was enriched after the addition of substrates. The sugar, cellulose and other substances were converted into acetate, ethanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide by Sphaerochaeta (Ritalahti et al., 2012). Proteiniphilum is a proteolytic bacterium that produces acid and CO2 (Chen and Dong, 2005). Significantly, the proportion of Sphaerochaeta in AC-2, BC-3 and CC-2 gradually dropped with the extension of fermentation time, which may be caused by the decline of cellulose content in the late stage of fermentation. This is consistent with the abundance of cellulase (EC: 3.2.1.4) observed with the fermentation time in the functional prediction analysis. Due to the dominance of Sphaerochaeta in the early stage of fermentation, the CO2 content of the whole fermentation system increased, and Proteiniphilum catalyzed the synthesis of acetic acid using H2/CO2. Therefore, the proportion of Proteiniphilum reached a peak in AC-2(P), BC-3(P) and CC-2(P). (2) Archaea community structure The analysis of archaeal community structure showed the main genera in all experimental groups were Methanosarcina (5.36–54.35%), Methanothrix (1.12–52.31%), Methanobacterium (4.55–83.15%) and Methanoculleus (0.58–32.61%) (Fig. 3(b)). Methanosarcina is a diverse methanogen, which includes aceticlastic, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic pathways (Zhang and Loh, 2019), and its high abundance can maintain stable methane production in the fermentation system. The addition of coal and corn straw increased the conversion efficiency of carbohydrates to acetic acid, H2/CO2 and methyl compounds in the early stage, thereby increasing the activity of Methanosarcina. Methanosarcina has higher semi saturation constant (lower affinity for acetate) and higher growth rate, which makes it more aggressive in the environment with high concentration of ammonia or acetic acid (Li et al., 2017; Blume et al., 2010). These conditions enable Methanosarcina to gradually gain dominance among the competitive methanogens, and thus it reaches the maximum proportion at the late stage of fermentation. Methanothrix is an aceticlastic methanogen (Huser et al., 1982). Compared with Methanosarcina, Methanothrix is strongly active at lower acetic acid concentration, which leads to its lower abundance in the experimental group compared with CK. However, with the extension of fermentation time, Methanothrix content also reaches the maximum, which can be explained by the higher affinity of Methanothrix for the degradation of organic matter (Zhao et al., 2020). The addition of substrate has a great influence on the activity of Methanobacterium, and the activity of Methanoculleus was also increased with the augment of methyl compounds and H2/CO2 production in the early stage of fermentation. Therefore, the proportion of Methanoculleus in AC-2(E), BC-3(E) and CC-2(E) was higher than that of CK. This may be due to the fact that the activity of specific hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanobacterium) is easily affected by lower pH (Ma et al., 2005), while Methanoculleus (hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens) is hardly affected (Ma et al., 2020). When acetic acid is metabolized by aceticlastic methanogens, the pH of the whole fermentation environment is increased, and the activity of Methanobacterium is increased, which indirectly indicates that there is a synergistic relationship between aceticlastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, also consistent with previous studies (Ros et al., 2017). When competing with Metonoculleus, Methanobacterium was superior, i.e., it had higher proportion. Among different samples, the proportion of Methanobacterium in CC-2(P) reached 83.15%. It is speculated that in the case of lower acetic acid production, the proportion of Methanobacterium not only exceeds that of methanogens with the same nutrient, but also keeps the competition edge with Methanosarcina. Overall, the structure of archaea changed from aceticlastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogens when the fermentation substrate changed from high to low rank coals."
10,Metabolic pathway analysis of methanogens,"3.5 Metabolic pathway analysis of methanogens The aceticlastic, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic pathways of were analyzed, and the related genes and their relative abundances are shown in Table 5 . Hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic pathways are two of the key methanogenic pathways. In addition, the proportion of hydrogenotrophic pathway was significantly higher than that of aceticlastic and methylotrophic pathways in AC-2, BC-3 and CC-2. The results showed that the hydrogenotrophic pathway was more competitive than that of aceticlastic pathway during the combined fermentation of coal and corn straw, which was associated with the higher CO2 concentrations of 70.11%, 61.41% and 72.59%, of AC-2(P), BC-3(P) and CC-2(P) respectively. In order to better comprehend the anaerobic digestion process of coal and corn straw, KEGG database was used to draw the metabolic pathways of hydrolysis, acidification, acidogenesis and methanogenesis during the peak period of methane production (Fig. 4 ). Acidogenesis is known to be the second predominant metabolism during methane production. L-lactate dehydrogenase (K00016, EC: 1.1.1.27) converts pyruvate to lactate during metabolism of isolactic acid (Abdel-Rahman et al., 2013). Moreover, acetate kinase (K00925, EC: 2.7.2.1) as a crucial enzyme can degrade lactic acid to acetate (Villa Montoya et al., 2019). The liquid phase analysis of CC-2(P) showed that more newly produced VFAs were detected in its fermentation system, while the sum of the abundance of the two enzymes L-lactate dehydrogenase and acetate kinase in CC-2(P) accounted for a larger percentage, confirming the high correlation between the liquid phase product and the enzyme abundance. The production potential of H2/CO2 was related to pyruvate synthase (k00925, EC: 1.2.7.1) and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (EC: 1.2.7.-), which decomposed pyruvate to form fermentation intermediate (H2/CO2) (Hallenbeck, 2009). The content of pyruvate synthase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase in CC-2(P) was higher than that in AC-2(P) and BC-3(P) (Table 4). According to the microbial community structure of the CC-2, the dominant methanogens observed changed from Methanosarcina (41.78%) and Methanoculleus (32.61%) to Methanobacterium (83.15%). This verified that more H2/CO2 was produced in the fermentation system, which can also be confirmed from the change in the characteristics of CO2 concentration, providing a rich metabolic substrate for Methanobacterium. In the aceticlastic pathway, the key enzymes involved in the conversion of acetate to acetate-CoA were acetate kinase (K00925, EC: 2.7.2.1), acetate-CoA ligase (K00193, EC: 6.2.1.1) and phosphate acetyltransferase (K00625, EC: 2.3.1.8) (Yin et al., 2018). Methanothrix primarily expressed the genes that encoded acetate-CoA ligase to catalyze the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA (Wang et al., 2018), and also acts on propanoate and propenoate. The phosphate acetyltransferase converts acetyl-phosphate to acetate in the presence of two NDP+ molecules (Thapa et al., 2017) and also acts with other short-chain acyl-CoAs. Among AC-2(P), BC-3(P) and CC-2(P), the relative abundances of these three enzymes were quite different (Table 5), which meant that the metabolic activity of aceticlastic pathway was easily affected by coal rank. Acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase were more active in BC-3(P), therefore, it is speculated that it can convert most acetate. The abundance of acetate-CoA ligase in CC-2(P) was significantly higher than that in AC-2(P) and BC-3(P), exhibiting highest content of acetyl-CoA and converted propionate and acrylate. Another key enzyme of the aceticlastic pathway was acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase β subunit (K14138, EC: 2.3.1.169) and acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase γδ subunit (K00194, EC: 2.1.1.245), which were mainly produced in Methanosarcina (Ma et al., 2020). Acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase β subunit is involved in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from CO2 and H2. Acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase γδ subunit catalyzes the demethylation of acetyl-CoA and also forms CO2, which is a key step for the conversion of acetic acid to methane. With the decrease in coal rank, the abundance of Methanosarcina also decreased significantly (Fig. 3), and the content of Acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase β subunit also decreased, while there was no significant difference in acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase γδ subunit (Table 5). No significant difference in the content of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase (K00200, EC: 1.2.99.5) was observed. The coenzyme F420 hydrogenase (K00440, EC: 1.2.98.1) in CC-2(P) can combine with NADPH to oxidize formaldehyde to form formic acid, and its higher abundance is directly related to the activity of Methanobacterium. Three important enzymes of methylotrophic pathway- ([Trimethylamine-corrinoid protein] Co-methyltransferase (K14083, EC: 2.1.1.250), [Dimethylamine-corrinoid protein] Co-methyltransferase (K16178, EC: 2.1.1.249) and [Methylamine-corrinoid protein] Co-methyltransferase (K16176, EC: 2.1.1.248)) were more active in BC-3(P), in addition, it is involved in the methane production from trimethylamine, dimethylamine, and methylamine, respectively. Except for the more active archaea in BC-3, 49.32% of the unidentified archaea were detected, and of which there may be archaea that mainly metabolize methyl compounds."
11,Conclusions,"The methane production performance and metabolic process of combined fermentation of coal and corn straw was investigated in this study. The methane production from combined fermentation of coal with higher coal rank and corn straw showed better synergistic effect. The degradation products of cellulose and hemicellulose in corn straw and the liquid-phase dissolved organic matter promoted the methane production. As the substrate changed from high to low rank coal, the archaeal community was transformed aceticlastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogens. In addition, the relative abundance of enzymes related to the hydrogenotrophic metabolic pathway was higher than that related to aceticlastic metabolic pathway."
