0,Introduction,"The pursuit of hydrogen energy rises from the energy crisis in the last century and becomes urgent with the ever-growing global energy demand and the deterioration of the environmental problems brought by fossil fuels (Benemann, 1996; Kumar and Chowdhary, 2016). Based on the raw materials utilized, hydrogen production processes are divided into conventional (with fossil fuels) and renewable processes (with renewable resources) (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). To reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, renewable processes, such as hydrogen production via fermentation with wastewater containing biodegradable organics, have drawn great attention in the past decades (Lay et al., 2019; Pachiega et al., 2019). In wastewater treatment, anaerobic digestion (AD) converts the chemical energy from organic substrates to biogas (e.g., H2 and CH4), which has been proved to be one of the most economical biohydrogen production processes (Anukam et al., 2019). Two-phase AD consists of acidogenic phase and methanogenetic phase, and dark fermentative hydrogen occurs at the former phase accompanied by the production of volatile acids (Elreedy et al., 2019). Based on the predominant liquid products, dark fermentation can be divided into ethanol-type, butyrate-type, and propionate-type fermentations (Huo et al., 2018; Mohd-Zaki et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013). The main biochemical reactions from glucose occurred in different types are described by the equations below: (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 C O O H + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 C H 3 C H 2 O H + 2 CO 2 (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 C O O H + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 C O O H + 2 H 2 O Eq. (1) is the reaction equation of acetate generation, which is an ideal pathway for hydrogen production with a H2 yield of 4 mol/mol-glucose, which is the maximum theoretical H2 yield of dark fermentation. However, in mesophilic conditions, various byproducts, such as ethanol (Eq. (2)), butyrate (Eq. (3)), and propionate (Eq. (4)), are produced simultaneously. The fermentation type is named by the predominant byproduct of acetate. Ethanol and acetate are the predominant liquid products in ethanol-type fermentation, and Ethanoligenens harbinense Yuan-3 and X-29 are two representative strains of this fermentation type (Xing et al., 2006). Butyrate and acetate are the two predominant liquid products (70–90% in total) of butyrate-type fermentation, and various Clostridium, such as C. butyricum and C. tyrobutyricum, exhibited such fermentation type (Hawkes et al., 2007; Suo et al., 2018). Propionate-type fermentation shows the lowest hydrogen production capacity while ethanol-type and butyrate-type fermentations produce a large amount of hydrogen, and are the main fermentation types for hydrogen production. Even though fermentative hydrogen production is widely studied, the hydrogen yield is still too low to meet the economical requirements to compete with conventional processes (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). Intensive efforts have been made to break this bottleneck and increase the competitiveness of fermentative hydrogen production. Optimizations of the process parameters (such as pH, redox potential (ORP) and hydraulic retention time) and reactor configuration are effective in improving hydrogen yield (Li et al., 2019; Silva-Illanes et al., 2017). Bioaugmentation with efficient hydrogen-producing strains, either newly isolated or metabolically modified, can also enhance the overall performance of biohydrogen production (Okonkwo et al., 2019). Recently, the addition of catalysts, such as Ginkgo biloba leaves, shows the ability to improve substrate conversion rate and hydrogen yield, which is a potential direction for enhanced hydrogen production by fermentation (Li et al., 2020). Biochar, a charred carbon-rich matter, has attracted enormous attention in environmental science and engineering in recent years and may be another catalyst capable of enhancing fermentative hydrogen production. Biochar is produced in thermochemical processes of biomass for the productions of syngas and bio-oil (Qian et al., 2015). Biochar exhibits diverse appealing features, such as electrical conductivity, rich functional groups, large surface area, and high porosity, endowing it with versatile applications in a broad spectrum of areas, such as carbon sequestration (Sheng et al., 2016), contaminated water and soil restoration (Ahmad et al., 2014), and gas adsorption (Chen et al., 2017). Biochar has functioned as a catalyst or catalyst precursor in a variety of processes, including chemical production (e.g., hydrolysis, isomerization, and rehydration), energy production (e.g., bio-oil production and biogas production via thermal-chemical reactions), and pollution control (Xiong et al., 2017). Besides these thermal-chemical processes, biochar has been added into mesophilic fermentation to study its role for biofuel productions. Sunyoto et al. (2016) added biochar into the two-phase AD and obtained enhanced hydrogen and methane production in acidogenic and methanogenic phase, respectively. Enhanced hydrogen production with biochar addition was also observed in acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation and other processes (Wu et al., 2019b; Zhang et al., 2017). Even though a few studies reported the effects of biochar on some hydrogen production processes, many of them were mixed acid-type fermentations, and the mechanisms were mostly hypotheses that remained to be fully elucidated. In this work, the effects of rice straw-derived biochar on dark fermentative hydrogen production were determined with different fermentation types, namely ethanol-type and butyrate-type fermentations. Rice straw is one of the most abundant agricultural biomasses in China, which makes it an inexpensive source for biochar production. Also, the use of rice straw could relieve the environmental problems brought by inappropriate disposal of rice straw (Ren et al., 2019). The dosages of biochar for different fermentation types were optimized. Glucose consumption and liquid products were analyzed to study the effects of biochar on substrate utilization and metabolic profiles. Broth pH and ORP, cell biomass and immobilization, and mineral nutrients were also studied to illuminate the functional mechanisms of biochar. This study systematically investigated the effects and possible functional mechanisms of biochar on ethanol-type and butyrate-type biohydrogen production for the first time."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strains and media,"2.1 Strains and media Pure cultures of Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 and Ethanoligenens harbinense Yuan-3 were employed to study butyrate-type and ethanol-type fermentation, respectively. C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 was a gift from Dr. Shang-Tian Yang’s Laboratory at the Ohio State University. E. harbinense Yuan-3 was maintained in School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology (Xing et al., 2006). Clostridial growth medium (CGM) supplemented with 15 g/L glucose was used in this study for culture of both C. tyrobutyricum and E. harbinense. All media were flushed with pure nitrogen for 0.5 h to remove oxygen, and autoclaved at 121 °C, 15 psig for 0.5 h."
3,Preparation of biochar,"2.2 Preparation of biochar Rice straw was dried and ground into particles (~40 mesh) in an electrical grinder. Pyrolysis of the rice straw particles was performed in a vacuum tube furnace (Shanghai Micro-X furnace Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) under a nitrogen atmosphere at 700 °C for 4 h with a pyrolysis heating rate of 10 °C/min. After cooling down, the pyrolysis product biochar was milled to pass a 200-mesh sieve. The average biochar yield from raw rice straw was 30 ± 0.5% in this study. The prepared biochar was stored in a dry place at room temperature for future use."
4,Batch fermentations,"2.3 Batch fermentations Batch fermentations were all carried out in 160 mL serum bottles containing 50 mL CGM media. All fermentations were conducted at 37 °C. The initial pH of the media (before adding biochar) was adjusted to 7.0 with 10% NaOH. Then different concentrations of biochar (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 g/L) were added into the media, and then oxygen removal and sterilization were carried out as described in Section 2.1. Overnight cultured strains were inoculated into the media with an inoculum size of 5%. Gas samples were taken every 6 or 12 h by transferring the gas from bottle headspace to gas sampling bag, and liquid samples were taken at the end of fermentation. Fermentations of each condition were repeated at least three times."
5,Kinetics analysis,"2.4 Kinetics analysis The accumulative H2 productions in different fermentation conditions were fitted with the modified Gompertz model (Eq. (5)) (Zwietering et al., 1990) in GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc, USA): (5) H = H m ∗ e x p { - exp R m ∗ e H m λ - t + 1 } where H (mL) is the accumulative H2 production at fermentation time t (h); Hm (mL) represents the maximum H2 production potential; Rm (mL/h) stands for the highest H2 productivity, and e equals to 2.71828; λ (h) represents the lag-phase time."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The morphology and microstructure of the biochar and cell immobilization inside were characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Sigma 500, ZEISS, England). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore volume of biochar were evaluated by analyzing N2 adsorption data (Quadrasorb SI Automated Surface Area & Pore Size Analyzer, USA). The graphitization degree of the materials was characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Raman, XploRA INV, Horiba, Japan). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, SPECTRUM ONE B, PerkinElmer, USA) was recorded over the region of 400–4000 cm−1 to analyze the major functional groups. Gas samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A, Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a Porapack Q column (Agilent Technologies, 19006-80015). The conditions used were as previously reported (Li et al., 2019). Volatile acids and alcohols were determined by gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A, Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a DB-FFAP column (122-3232, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm, Agilent Technologies, USA). Cell masses in different treatments were compared by measuring the whole protein concentration of cells: when fermentation ended, cells and biochar were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by ultrasonication with a Vibra-Cell Ultrasonic Processor (Sonics VCX134PB-1, Newtown, USA) to release the intracellular proteins; the lysate was centrifuged, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China). Glucose concentration was determined with the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (Wu et al., 2019a). ORP was determined by an ORP probe (ORP-169E, Shenzhen Yago Technology CO., LTD, Shenzhen, China). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0 to compare the hydrogen productions in different fermentation conditions, and the significance level was set as 0.05."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effects of biochar on H2 productions in different types of fermentations,"3.1 Effects of biochar on H2 productions in different types of fermentations Different concentrations of biochar (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 g/L) were added to the media to study the effects on hydrogen productions in ethanol- and butyrate-type fermentations. As shown in Fig. 1 , the addition of biochar exhibited significant promotion on both ethanol-type and butyrate-type fermentations. For ethanol-type fermentation with E. harbinense Yuan-3 (Fig. 1A), the control group (0 g/L biochar) produced 57.64 mL H2, while the group supplemented with 3 g/L biochar obtained 118.4% higher hydrogen production (125.87 mL). No hydrogen was produced with biochar as the sole substrate, indicating biochar was not degraded or converted to hydrogen. Further increasing the dosage of biochar did not gain further improvement in hydrogen production, indicating 3 g/L biochar was enough for ethanol-type fermentation with 15 g/L glucose. As shown in Table 1 , glucose was not completely consumed in the fermentation without biochar, while ~100% glucose consumption was obtained in fermentations with 3–12 g/L biochar. Hydrogen yield, namely hydrogen moles per mole glucose consumed, was also increased when biochar was added. 1.11 mol-H2/mol-glucose was obtained in the control and 20.7% higher hydrogen yield was obtained when 3 g/L biochar was added. Hydrogen yields stayed at the same level (1.25–1.34 mol-H2/mol-glucose) when biochar dosage increased from 3 to 12 g/L. Modified Gompertz model was applied to fit the cumulative hydrogen productions with different biochar supplementations, and the calculated results were used for the analyses of H2 productivity and lag phase (Table 1). The addition of biochar could significantly improve the hydrogen productivity and the maximal value was 6.15 mL/h with 3 g/L biochar, 220.3% higher than that with 0 g/L biochar. The hydrogen productivity remained at a similar level when biochar concentration increased from 3 g/L to 12 g/L. The Gompertz model analysis showed a gradual increase of lag-phase time (from 5.07 to 13.7 h) when biochar concentration increased from 0 to 12 g/L (Table 1). However, the groups with biochar did not show delayed but faster hydrogen productions during 0–12 h in real experiments (Fig. 1A). In regards of H2 yield and productivity, 3 g/L biochar was determined to be the optimal concentration for E. harbinense. A similar effect of biochar was observed on the hydrogen performance of butyrate-type fermentation (Fig. 1B). When no biochar was added, 106.10 mL hydrogen was produced. After adding 3–12 g/L biochar, 182–197 mL hydrogen was produced with C. tyrobutyricum, showing the great improvement effect of biochar on butyrate-type fermentation (e.g., 79.6% enhancement with 3 g/L biochar). There was no significant difference between hydrogen productions with different dosages of biochar. Glucose conversion was 69.3% in the control, and 3 g/L biochar improved the conversion ratio to 86.0%. Glucose was exhausted in fermentations with 6–12 g/L biochar. This was different from the glucose consumption in the ethanol-type fermentation, where 3 g/L biochar was enough to promote glucose consumption to 100%. The highest hydrogen yield (2.36 mol/mol-glucose) was obtained with 3 g/L biochar, 44.8% higher than that of the control. Hydrogen yields decreased gradually when biochar increased from 3 to 12 g/L, but were still much higher than that of the control. Hydrogen productivity was significantly improved in biochar-treated fermentations (Table 1), and the highest hydrogen productivity of 11.4 mL/h was achieved with 12 g/L biochar, 317.6% higher than that at 0 g/L (2.73 mL/h). Compared to the ethanol-type fermentation, the addition of biochar resulted in a larger improvement in hydrogen yield in butyrate-type fermentation (Table 1). Similar to ethanol-type fermentation of E. harbinense, the Gompertz model showed that the lag phase time of C. tyrobutyricum increased with higher biochar concentration, which was not in line with the previous report with pine sawdust-derived biochar (Sunyoto et al., 2016). Compared to E. harbinense, C. tyrobutyricum seemed to need a longer time to adapt to the high biochar concentration. Considering the high hydrogen yield and short lag phase, 3 g/L biochar was appropriate for hydrogen production with C. tyrobutyricum. In previous studies, 8.3 g/L biochar was the optimized dosage in a two-phase AD when pine sawdust was used to produce the biochar (Sunyoto et al., 2016), while 0.6 g/L biochar gave the highest hydrogen production with corn-bran residue as the biochar source in the study of Zhang et al. (2017). In this study, 3 g/L rice straw-derived biochar was the optimal dosage for both ethanol- and butyrate-type fermentations, indicating the characteristics of the original material played an important role in the functions of biochar. The hydrogen production processes (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017), medium compositions (Mangayil et al., 2015), feedstock concentration (Li et al., 2019), and inoculum (Zhang et al., 2015) would also affect the optimal dosage of biochar. The enhancement effects of biochar on hydrogen production can result from its buffering capacity, O-containing functional groups, porosity, or mineral nutrients, which will be investigated in the following sections."
9,Effects of biochar on liquid products,"3.2 Effects of biochar on liquid products As a part of the whole metabolic network, the change of hydrogen production was accompanied by changes in other metabolic products. As shown in Fig. 2 , the addition of biochar significantly increased the final concentration of liquid products in fermentations of both E. harbinense and C. tyrobutyricum. For ethanol-type fermentation with E. harbinense, ethanol and acetate were the predominant liquid products (with a trace amount of lactic acid). Both ethanol and acetate were more than 2 times higher in the biochar-treated groups than in the control group (0 g/L biochar) (Fig. 2A). Fermentation without biochar produced 1.37 g/L ethanol and 1.15 g/L acetate while fermentation with 3 g/L biochar produced 4.07 g/L ethanol and 2.60 g/L acetate. Further increase of biochar did not result in significant changes in ethanol or acetate productions. As shown in Table 1, fermentation without biochar only consumed 55.6% glucose while fermentations with 3–12 g/L biochar consumed ~ 100% glucose, which was the key to the significant differences of liquid product concentrations and hydrogen productions. Fig. 2B shows the liquid product concentrations in the fermentation of C. tyrobutyricum. Acetate and butyrate were the dominant liquid products of C. tyrobutyricum. When no biochar was added, 0.79 g/L acetate and 3.00 g/L butyrate were produced. After adding 3 g/L biochar, acetate production (1.00 g/L) increased by 26.6% and butyrate production (4.60 g/L) increased by 53.3%. When biochar concentration increased from 3 to 9 g/L, acetate and butyrate productions were slightly increased. When 12 g/L biochar was supplemented, acetate production was decreased while butyrate production remained at a similar level compared to fermentations with 6–9 g/L biochar. Similar to the fermentation of E. harbinense, the differences in liquid product concentrations of C. tyrobutyricum was resulted from the different consumptions of glucose in different treatments. As shown in Table 1, glucose consumption increased from 69.3% to 86.0% when 3 g/L biochar was added, and ~100% glucose was consumed when the biochar was increased to 6–12 g/L in C. tyrobutyricum fermentations. The similar increasing trend of glucose consumption and liquid product concentrations indicated that the addition of biochar could improve glucose consumption and consequent liquid product concentrations. It should be noted that 3 g/L biochar gave a glucose consumption ratio of 86.0% but the highest hydrogen production (Table 1), indicating that with higher biochar concentrations (6–12 g/L), glucose was consumed to produce other products prior to hydrogen."
10,pH and ORP,"3.3 pH and ORP pH and ORP were proved to be two of the key factors governing the fermentative hydrogen production (Ren et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011). Incomplete glucose consumption usually occurred when pH dropped to a very low level due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids in dark fermentation (Carvalho et al., 2013; Jia et al., 2019). The change of pH might explain the effects of biochar on hydrogen production and glucose consumption. Fig. 3 A shows the time course of pH in the ethanol-type fermentation with E. harbinense. The addition of different dosages of biochar gave different initial pH values of the broth. After inoculation, the initial pH value of the group without biochar was 5.83, and this parameter rose to 6.20 when 3 g/L biochar was added. When biochar concentration increased from 3 to 12 g/L, the initial pH value increased from 6.20 to 7.01 gradually. This trend demonstrated the alkalinity of biochar, which was in line with previous reports (Paritosh and Vivekanand, 2019). As fermentation went on, the pH values in all groups dropped rapidly due to the accumulation of volatile acid. Despite a higher initial pH, fermentation with 3 g/L biochar dropped to a lower final pH value than that without biochar, which could be explained by the higher glucose conversion and the consequent higher acid production. The final pH values increased from 3.99 to 4.41 when biochar increased from 3 to 12 g/L. Higher dosages of biochar could produce comparable levels of acetic acid to that with 3 g/L biochar (Fig. 2A), but the high initial pH ensured that more acid ions could be neutralized and higher final pH values were therefore obtained. The alkalinity of biochar along with its inexpensive cost made it a promising economical pH buffer in real applications for hydrogen production. ORP is a parameter indicating the overall reducing or oxidizing capacity of a system (Søndergaard, 2009; Zhu et al., 2019). Fig. 3B shows the time-dependent ORP changes in ethanol-type fermentations with different dosages of biochar. The initial ORP was lowered from −122 mV to −271 mV when biochar concentration increased from 0 to 12 g/L, suggesting the addition of biochar could efficiently lower the ORP in the broth. The ORP values then dropped rapidly at 12 h, indicating vast amounts of electrons were released into the reducing power pool. This occurred when cell growth was active, and glucose was broken down and utilized. Compared to the group without biochar, fermentations with biochar presented lower ORP and faster decrease of ORP during 0–12 h, indicating the addition of biochar boosted the substrate consumption rate. During 12–24 h, the ORP values in fermentations with 6–12 g/L biochar increased slightly at around −400 mV, while those with 0–3 g/L biochar were still decreasing (down to around −350 mV). After 24 h, ORP values in all fermentation groups started to increase rapidly, which was due to the decelerating substrate utilization and faster cell death (Zhu et al., 2019). Fermentations with 0–6 g/L biochar obtained similar final ORP values (around −40 mV), while 9–12 g/L biochar gave lower final ORP values (around −100 mV). These results demonstrated the redox activity of biochar, which was reported previously in various environmentally relevant redox reactions, such as reduction of As(V) to As(III) and Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (Choppala et al., 2016). FT-IR spectrum showed that the diverse O-containing functional groups were formed after pyrolysis of rice straw, such as –C=O, –C–O, and –OH. It was reported that the O-containing functional groups could function as electron donors to reduced products (Xu et al., 2019), which could possibly explain the way how biochar improved the hydrogen yield: donating electrons to protons to form hydrogen."
11,Cell immobilization,"3.4 Cell immobilization Biochar exhibited excellent porosity with large surface area, and therefore was successfully applied in fermentation as cell immobilization materials (Kyriakou et al., 2019). The significant improvement effects of biochar on hydrogen production and productivity could also be the result of cell immobilization. The rice straw biochar in this study showed an average pore diameter of 1.614 nm and a volume of 0.102 cm3 g−1. SEM images confirmed the cell immobilization of both E. harbinense and C. tyrobutyricum on biochar. Large amounts of cells adhered to the biochar, especially in the porous structures. Cell immobilization reduced the fluid-mechanical forces on bacteria and protected the cells from end-product inhibition, thereby achieving a high cell mass and a high hydrogen productivity (Li et al., 2019). To quantificationally demonstrate the effect of biochar on cell mass, protein concentrations in different treatments were assayed and compared to indicate the change of cell mass (Fig. 4 ). The protein concentration at 0 h of the control group (0.71 ± 0.11 g/L) was not significantly different from the group with 3 g/L biochar (0.86 ± 0.11 g/L). At the end of the fermentation, the protein concentration of the biochar-treated group was 2.38 ± 0.17 g/L, 25.3% higher than that of the control. The enhancement in protein concentration showed the addition of biochar boosted the cell growth and cell mass. Immobilization on biochar could protect cells from product inhibition and hydraulic shear force, resulting in active cell growth and high cell biomass, which was in line with previous studies (Huang et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2014). High amounts of viable cells improved glucose consumption and thus contributed to the high hydrogen production and productivity with biochar."
12,Mineral nutrients,"3.5 Mineral nutrients The final concentrations of different mineral elements in fermentations with 0–12 g/L biochar are shown in Fig. 5 , including Na, Fe, Mg, K, P, Zn, Mn, and Ca. The final concentration of Na in the control group was 138.80 mg/L, while in the group treated with 3 g/L biochar, Na concentration increased to 200.38 mg/L, indicating Na was released from the rice straw-derived biochar. With the increase of biochar dosage, Na concentration increased accordingly at 16.1 mg/g-biochar. Na is functional in the oxidation mechanisms and transmembrane transportation of ions and substrates in cells (Fang et al., 2011). A high concentration of Na ion could inhibit cell growth by arousing a hyperosmotic environment or interfering intracellular cation homeostasis (Watcharawipas et al., 2018). Since the reported concentration of Na for 50% inhibition was 11.0 × 103 mg/L in anaerobic digestion (Fang et al., 2011), the Na release of biochar was low (16.1 mg/g) and would not affect the cell growth or hydrogen production. Fe is critical in the formation of hydrogenase as hydrogenase is a metalloenzyme whose active site contains Fe, and thus Fe is usually supplemented in biohydrogen productions to improve hydrogen production (Lubitz et al., 2014; Yin and Wang, 2019). As shown in Fig. 5, the supplementation of biochar could significantly increase the Fe concentration, but Fe concentrations in all the groups were very low (0.63–5.94 mg/L). This was because the components of CGM used in this study did not contain iron salt, suggesting Fe could be added if CGM would be used for hydrogen production in the future. Biochar also released Mg and K into the broth. As Mg is essential for cell growth, the addition of biochar could boost cell growth, which was in line with the increased cell mass discussed above. Compared with the control without biochar (309.86 mg/L), the concentrations of P in biochar treatments were at similar levels (337.85–376.18 mg/L). Zinc concentrations were very low (<0.5 mg/L) in the fermentation broths with and without biochar, indicating no zinc was released from rice straw-derived biochar. Zinc could inhibit the key enzymes in glucose metabolism at a concentration of 3.25 mg/L, and thus the low Zn content of biochar could ensure the glucose catabolism and cell growth (Ong et al., 2015). For manganese ion, the control contained 0.04 mg/L, while the 3 g/L biochar-group contained 1.11 mg/L, and a further increase in biochar concentration resulted in an increase in Mn concentration at 0.45 mg/g-biochar. The CGM media without biochar contained trace Ca (3.64 mg/L) and rice straw biochar released Ca to the fermentation broth at 9.12 mg/g-biochar. Increasing biochar concentration from 3 to 12 g/L showed different effects on H2 productivity in ethanol- and butyrate-type fermentations (unobvious and significantly positive, respectively), which was possibly due to the different mineral nutrient requirements of E. harbinense and C. tyrobutyricum. The release of appropriate concentrations of mineral elements by biochar was another possible reason of the high hydrogen production in different types of fermentations. The rich mineral element contents make biochar an inexpensive mineral nutrient alternative in fermentation, which has already been proved feasible and economical (Sun et al., 2019)."
13,Conclusion,"This study revealed that rice straw-derived biochar could buffer the pH, lower the ORP, immobilize cells, and release rich mineral nutrients, which benefited cell growth and substrate consumption. High cell biomass and substrate conversion consequently improved the hydrogen production and productivity significantly in ethanol-type and butyrate-type fermentations. This work enhanced the understanding of the promotion effects and mechanisms of biochar on fermentative hydrogen production, and also demonstrated the potential of biochar as an inexpensive catalyst to improve hydrogen production and productivity in large scale processes to further reduce the cost of hydrogen production via dark fermentation."
