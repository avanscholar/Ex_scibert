0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered to be one of the most promising alternative clean fuels for future energy carrier and it is hygienic and renewable (Kazim and Veziroglu, 2001; Ali et al., 2017a,b). Hydrogen can be produced from various domestic resources including steam reforming of fossil fuels, biomass, and water electrolysis (Pavlos and Andreas, 2017; Holladay et al., 2009). However, use of fossil fuels gives low purity of hydrogen with a high concentration of carbonaceous species such as SOx, NOx, CO2 and CO (Damyanova et al., 2012; Rashid et al., 2015). Hence, the clean technology is needed for hydrogen productions, which can be achieved if hydrogen is produced by the renewable source like water electrolysis, in this electrolysis process no emissions, no need for hazardous liquids, eco-friendly technology and will be possible to achieve hydrogen economy (Moriarty and Honnery, 2009). Water electrolysis is presently the most promising technology for hydrogen production from water due to the high efficiency and relatively low required energy input when compared to thermo-chemical and photo-catalytic methods (Ni et al., 2008). In water electrolysis process there are three main types of cells such as alkaline electrolysis cells (AECs), solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) and proton exchange membrane electrolysis cells (PEMEC) (Badwal et al., 2012). However, in electrochemical methods such as PEM electrolysis cells and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) were used as the Nafion® membranes and noble metal based electrocatalysts such as Pt, Pd based electrocatalysts as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (Grigoriev et al., 2007) and in RuO2, IrO2 and bimetallic oxides as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) these materials are highly expensive (Kalliopi et al., 2013; Ali et al., 2017a,b; Tahereh and Masoud, 2017). While coming to alkaline water electrolysis, it is one of the most efficient methods for hydrogen production because of environmental friendly and zero emission of carbon dioxide in this process, using renewable energy sources. Typically, alkaline water electrolysis offers several advantages such as well-established technology, compact design, low maintenance, high efficiency, produced high purity of hydrogen, used as low-cost non noble metal based catalysts compared to electrochemical methods (PEM electrolysis cells and solid oxide electrolysis cells), and multi cell stacks may be built for commercial applications (Abdin et al., 2015; Carmo et al., 2013; Seetharaman et al., 2013). Alkaline water electrolysis has become a grown-up technology; however, this technology still has some aspects to be improved such as the cost of hydrogen production and stability in alkaline medium (Santos et al., 2013; Albertini et al., 1992). Typically, in alkaline water electrolysis process widely used as the asbestos membrane as a separator in the last century (Modica et al., 1983), however, this asbestos material is toxic and hazardous for health, causing cancer, therefore to limit the usage of an asbestos membrane. For this reason, much effort was made to discover a new membrane separator material to replace the asbestos. During the last two decades, anion exchange membranes were developing rapidly for alkaline water electrolysis (Gab-Jin et al., 2015). An ideal membrane separator should have the following properties such as high chemical and mechanical stability in strong alkaline medium, high porosity and small pore size, good wettability, allowing ionic transport in the solution between electrodes, and low gas permeability. It can be achieved by inorganic and organic membranes, which is gained a growing interest in the recent years due to the good chemical and thermal stability, longer lifetime and their uniform pore size. For example, Vermeiren et al. (1998) were prepared Zirfon® separator based on the film-casting technique, composed of a polysulfone matrix and ZrO2, this separator was shown very stable in concentrated KOH solutions at elevated temperature. Seetharaman et al. (2011) synthesized Polyvinyl Alcohol based membrane separator was synthesized from polyvinyl alcohol, N, N, N’N’- Tetramethyl hexane-1,6 diamine, glutaraldehyde and titanium dioxide (TiO2) studied and concluded that this membrane have shown good mechanical and thermal stability. Dariusz Badwal et al. (2012) prepared the Mineral-based membranes from polysulfone and mineral fillers. These membrane separators showed a slightly better resistivity and gas purity values. Diaza et al. (2017) prepared Alkali-doped polyvinyl alcohol–polybenzimidazole membranes for alkaline water electrolysis. These membranes showed good chemical, thermal and mechanical stability in a KOH environment, but these materials were highly expensive. Among these different existing membranes, the TiO2 based membrane separators have gained a growing interest in the recent years due to the excellent electrical conductivity, good characteristics of high electrocatalytic activity. TiO2 has been intensively studied for their promising chemical, mechanical, optical, and electrical properties. In specific, the great interest has been dedicated to the study of the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 powders and thin films useful for the purification of water, air and the stipulation of self-cleaning surfaces (Tahereh et al., 2015; Farhadiana et al., 2012). The TiO2 cost-effective semiconductor it is widely used in energy relevant applications such as photocatalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells, lithium-ion batteries and gas sensing systems (Elham et al., 2014). The addition of TiO2 into polymer matrix was attempted to reduce the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the crystallinity of the polymer, and also increasing the ionic conductivity compared to other ceramic fillers such as SiO2, ZrO2 and Al2O3 because of their thermal, mechanical and electrical properties (Seetharaman et al., 2011). In this present study, a novel titanium oxide composite membrane separators were synthesized from polysulfone (PSF), Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and titanium (IV) oxide (TiO2) by phase inversion precipitation method. These prepared membrane separators electrochemical performance along with corresponding yields of hydrogen production were investigated in the in-house fabricated alkaline water electrolyser single cell assemblies with a 10 cm2 active area. Further, their performance compared with commercial asbestos membrane separators. In electrolysis process, various experimental conditions such as effects of temperature (30–80 °C) and KOH concentration (5–30 wt %) were studied. The synthesized titanium oxide composite membrane separators were characterized by FT-IR, FE-SEM and XRD analytical techniques."
1,Experimental methodology,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polysulfone (PSF), Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (molecular weight 40,000) reagent grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and Titanium (IV) oxide (TiO2) (Molecular Weight 79.87) were purchased from Merck. All the chemicals were used without further any purification."
3,Preparation of titanium (IV) oxide composite membrane,"2.2 Preparation of titanium (IV) oxide composite membrane The titanium oxide composite membrane separator was synthesized by phase inversion precipitation technique (Vermeiren et al., 1998; Seetharaman et al., 2011). In this technique, initially to prepare the casting solution, a certain amount of (5 wt %) polysulfone (PSF) was well-dispersed in the organic solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (75 wt %) with vigorous stirring at room temperature. After dissolving of PSF, the polymer additive of Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (5 wt%) was added into the above dispersion solution and vigorous stirring was continued at room temperature for 12 h to ensure the dissolution of PSF and PVP. followed by the addition of titanium (IV) oxide (15 wt%) and vigorous stirring was carried out at room temperature again for 12 h to ensure the equal dissolution and dispersion of titanium oxide to form a casting solution (Dariusz et al., 2015; Diaza et al., 2017). This prepared casting solution was left for about 12 h to allow a complete release of air bubbles (Song et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014). Subsequently, the casting solution was cast on the clean glass plate using a stainless steel knife to maintain the uniform thickness to get a casting film of titanium oxide and the film was exposed to atmosphere at room temperature for few seconds subsequently the coasting glass plate was immersed into a water bath of pure deionized water about 10 min. After immersion in a water bath, the casted film immediately turned in to the white in colour and separated out from the glass plate and (film) membrane. The membrane casting process was performed at a constant temperature (room temperature) chamber to control the temperature and humidity. Later the prepared membrane was rinsed several times with deionized water and kept in pure water for more than 12 h, to remove the residual solvents. Finally, the casting membrane was stored in pure deionized water until it was further studied."
4,Membrane water uptake capacity,"2.3 Membrane water uptake capacity The membranes water uptake (Wut) was determined by difference in weight (W) between the dried membranes and swollen (wet) membranes. The weight of the dried membrane was measured (Wdry) and then the membrane was immersed in a deionized water bath for 6 h. Then, the membrane was removed from the water bath, wiped with blotting paper and weighed again to obtain the wet weight (Wwet). The membranes water uptake (Wut) was calculated by the following equation (1). (1) W ut ( % ) = W wet − W dry W dry × 100"
5,Membrane swelling capacity,"2.4 Membrane swelling capacity The membranes swelling properties were determined by measuring the change of the membrane geometrical area upon equilibrating the membranes in water at room temperature for 6 h. The membrane swelling ratio was calculated using following equation (2). (2) Swelling ( % ) = S wet − S dry S dry × 100 Where, Sdry is area of dry membrane and Swet is area of wet membrane samples of the plain area, respectively."
6,Electrolysis experimental setup,"2.5 Electrolysis experimental setup The titanium oxide composite membrane separators performance was evaluated in-house fabricated alkaline water electrolyser single cell 10 cm2 assemblies and represented in Fig. 1 . The prepared titanium oxide composite membrane of the 10 cm2 active area was placed in between two stainless steel plates with straight parallel flow field design inside to facilitate a flow of reactants and products followed by nickel current collectors and silicon gasket subsequently tightened using nuts and bolts with a torque 9 N m2. Each cell has suitable inlet/outlets for circulation of KOH solution as well as for produced gases (hydrogen and oxygen) at their respective electrodes. The main electrolyte (KOH) storage reservoir capacity is 2 L it was arranged at the middle top of the setup. The Gas-liquid separators capacity of 1 L it was fixed at besides the main storage reservoir. Each gas-liquid separator has interconnected with main storage reservoir because of to maintain the equal level of KOH solution at each gas-liquid separator, the gas-liquid separators connected with cell assembly through piping because of to circulate the KOH solution into the cell. A regulated DC power supply SABA Electronics, India. (5 V–10 A) was connected to the cell whereas one side is the anode and another side is a cathode, the Current-voltage characteristics of the cell were manually measured using a multimeter."
7,Experimental methodology,"2.6 Experimental methodology The prepared titanium oxide composite membrane (0.25 mm thickness) and commercially available asbestos membrane separators (1.5 mm thickness) electrochemical performances evaluated in alkaline water electrolyser single cell 10 cm2 assemblies for hydrogen production. In electrolysis process, KOH solution was used as the electrolyte, which was supplied to each cell via gas-liquid separators by interlinked piping. The supplied electrolyte solution was heated at the cell assembly using pencil heaters on both sides of the stainless steel end plates along with temperature indicator and controller for operating various set temperature 30–80 °C. The gas-liquid separators were provided to separate the produced gases such as hydrogen and oxygen from the electrolyte solution. A regulated DC power supplied to stainless steel end plates, oxygen side is an anode and hydrogen side is the cathode, the voltages of 1.5–2.5 V was applied to the cell and operated current densities of 0.01–1 A/cm2. The corresponding current-voltage characteristics at different operating temperatures (30 °C–80 °C) and different KOH concentrations (5–30 wt %) were recorded, as well as hydrogen quantity and purity was measured. The separated gases purity was determined by portable hydrogen gas analyzer (ENDEE. GAP-2008) and gas chromatographic (GC) technique and quantity measured by liquid displacement unit. All the experiments were repeated three times to check for the reproducibility."
8,Characterisation of membrane,"2.7 Characterisation of membrane The synthesized titanium oxide composite membrane separator was characterized by different analytical techniques. The presence of functional groups was determined using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Perkin Elmer. The membrane surface morphology and cross-section analysis were carried out using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) (ZEISS LSM 510 Meta). The synthesized titanium oxide composite membranes phase and crystallinity were investigated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) (PAN analytical X'Pert Pro MPD)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,FT-IR spectroscopy,"3.1 FT-IR spectroscopy The presence of functional groups in titanium oxide composite membrane was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy and represented in Fig. 2 . The characteristic absorption peak around 3445 cm−1 due to the presence of OH stretching vibrations of adsorbed water. The absorption peaks at 2922 cm−1 due to the presence of asymmetric and symmetric CH stretching vibrations of hydrocarbons (Tahereh et al., 2014). The absorption peak around 1629 cm−1 is due to the presence of bending vibration of water molecules (Ali et al., 2017a,b). The peaks at 1456 cm−1and 1403 cm−1 are due to the presence of CC aromatic stretching vibrations it may be attributed to the PSF. The absorption peaks around at 1113 cm−1 were due to the formation of acetal (COC) group. The peaks around 1302 cm−1and 985 cm−1 are due to the presence of CH bending vibrations PSF-PVP. The broad band below 950 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum belongs to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of the inorganic TiOTi complex (Tahereh et al., 2014; Ali et al., 2017a,b). The positions of vibration modes of all types of M-O bonds were strongly influenced by the interaction of TiO2 with the polymer (Seetharaman et al., 2011; Tahereh et al., 2016)."
11,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Titanium oxide and titanium oxide composite membranes phase and crystalline size were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and represented in Fig. 3 . From the Fig. 3(a) The major diffraction patrons of titanium oxide (TiO2) were observed with {101}, {004}, {200}, {105}, {211} and {204} the plane at 2θ values of 25.39°, 37.76°, 48.05°, 53.98°, 55.13° and 62.73° and From the Fig. 3(b) the major diffraction peaks of titanium oxide composite membranes were observed with {101}, {004}, {200}, {105}, {211} and {204} at 2θ values of 25.39°, 37.76°, 48.05°, 53.98°, 55.13° and 62.86° (Tahereh et al., 2015; Elham et al., 2014). The TiO2 peaks were clearly visible even in polymer rich compositions and it can be concluded that the TiO2 was well crystallizing in our experimental conditions. The sharp, intense peaks confirm the crystalline phase of the synthesized TiO2. All the diffraction peaks indicate the anatase structure of the titanium oxide. The average crystallite size of the titanium oxide and titanium oxide composite membranes were calculated from the major X-ray diffraction patrons of {101}, {200} and {204} according to the Debye–Scherrer's equation (Yuan et al., 2007) as shown in Eq. (3). (3) D = kλ β cos θ Where D is the average diameter in nm, k indicates the Debye–Scherrer's constant (0.89), λ is the wavelength of X-rays (λ = 0.154 nm), β indicates the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak and θ is the Bragg's diffraction angle. The calculated average crystallite size of TiO2 and composite membrane was found to be 3.93 nm. As shown in Table 2."
12,Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM),"3.3 Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) The titanium oxide composite membrane surface morphology and cross-sectional analysis were carried out by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) (ZEISS LSM 510 Meta) and represented in Fig. 4 . From Fig. 4(a) it was observed that the synthesized membrane surface was porous in nature, the pores are uniformly arranged and a uniform pore size. Fig. 4(b) shows the membrane cross-sectional view, it was observed that the pore is uniformly opened, therefore this might be useful to easily anions (OH−) are transported to the membrane and useful to getting pure hydrogen from alkaline electrolysis process (Li et al., 2014; Holladay et al., 2009)."
13,Water uptake and swelling characteristics of the membranes,"3.4 Water uptake and swelling characteristics of the membranes The membrane thickness and water uptake plays an important role in membrane conductivity by increasing the membrane thickness, the ionic resistance was increased thereby decreasing the membrane conductivity (Palaniappan and Sairam, 2008). The membrane thickness, water uptake, swelling, and current densities were given in Table 1 . It was observed that the asbestos membrane exhibits lower current density due to its high ionic resistance while compared to titanium oxide composite membrane."
14,Electrolysis performance of the membranes,"3.5 Electrolysis performance of the membranes The synthesized titanium oxide composite membrane electrolysis performance along with corresponding hydrogen production rate was studied in the in-house fabricated alkaline water electrolyzer single cell assembly with a 10 cm2 active area, at various current densities from 0.01 to 1A/cm2 in 30% KOH solution and 80 °C temperature and represented in Fig-5 and Table 3 . The electrolysis performance of synthesized titanium oxide composite membranes was compared with the commercial asbestos membrane. From the Fig. 5 it was observed that the current density was increased linear with the cell voltage, it may be attributed to the enhanced electro catalyticactivity and decrease in cell ohmic resistance (Shiva Kumar et al., 2017b; Ramakrishna et al., 2016). Initially, the asbestos membrane separator was observed a current density of 300 mA/cm2 at 2 V in 30% KOH solution and 80 °C temperature. However, the titanium oxide composite membrane was observed a current density of 600 mA/cm2 at 2 V in 30% KOH solution and 80 °C temperature. The obtained results show that the synthesized titanium oxide composite membrane exhibited 50% better electrochemical activity compared to the asbestos membrane. The current density depends upon the membrane conductivity, cell temperature, electrolyte concentration, membrane thickness, and membrane resistance, electrode conductivity and contact resistance among the current carrying components (Shiva Kumar et al., 2017a). Further, the stability studies were carried out with the titanium oxide composite membrane at a constant current density of 600 mA/cm2 in 2 V with 30% KOH solution at 80 °C and represented in Fig. 6 . The results show that the observed cell voltage of 2 V was almost stable during 100 h continuous operation and it reveals the reasonable stability of titanium oxide composite membrane in alkaline water electrolysis."
15,Effect of temperature,"3.6 Effect of temperature Effect of temperature on the cell performance in the titanium oxide composite membrane and asbestos membrane with a constant current density of 600 mA/cm2 and constant KOH concentration of 30 wt% at different temperatures from 30-80 °C were studied and represented in Fig. 7 . From the Fig. 7 it was observed that with increasing the cell temperature the cell voltage was decreased that is off in asbestos membrane 2.32 V–2.25 V and TiO2 composite membrane 2.12 V–2.0 V was obtained. However, the cell performance along with hydrogen production rate also increased with increasing the cell temperature, it may be attributed to the enhanced electro catalytic activity and decrease in cell ohmic resistance (Naga Mahesh et al., 2016)."
16,Effect of KOH concentration,"3.7 Effect of KOH concentration Effect of KOH concentration on the cell performance in all the membrane were studied at various KOH concentrations from 5 wt%–30 wt% at constant current density of 600 mA/cm2 and constant cell temperature at 80 °C and represented in Fig. 8 . From the Fig. 8 it was observed that with increasing the KOH concentration from 5 wt% to 30 wt% the corresponding voltage was decreased which in asbestos membrane 2.35 V to 2.25 V and TiO2 composite membrane 2.12 V to 2.0 V. The obtained results has shown that the cell performance was improved in the 30 wt% KOH solution compared to 5 wt% KOH solution in both membranes. The cell voltage reached minimum at 30 wt% KOH solution in electrolysis process, in this process membrane conductivity is place on important role therefore high concentrated electrolyte (30 wt%) must be used (Vermeiren et al., 1996; Seetharaman et al., 2011). From this study, it was observed that the asbestos materials have extremely high ionic resistance (Vermeiren et al., 1996), which gives the poor conductivity in the electrolysis process. Therefore, it give the lower electrochemical performance and also asbestos materials have high porosity and pore size thus it could be produced low purity of gases in the electrolysis process. In the case of TiO2 composite membrane have low ionic resistance and high conductivity consequently it gives the good electrolysis performance however which is smaller cell voltages than the asbestos membrane. TiO2 is an excellent hydrophilic and high specific surface area therefore while, the addition of TiO2 the viscosity of the casting solution was increased which would inhibit the formation of large pores and leads to form a dense surface layer as well as membrane resistance (Li et al., 2014). PVP is a pore-forming agent it will give the porosity of membrane (Song et al., 2012; Chakrabarty et al., 2008). Polysulfone (PSF) is an organic polymer which acts as a binder while addition of PSF the viscosity of the casting solution increased and gives enough mechanical strength, corrosion resistance and ionic conductivity of the membranes (Hibbs et al., 2008; Dariusz et al., 2015)."
17,Hydrogen purity,"3.8 Hydrogen purity The hydrogen production experiments were extended up to 250 min at a constant current density of 600 mA/cm2, to determine the hydrogen purity as shown in Fig. 9 . From the Fig. 9 it was observed that the hydrogen purity at the cathode (hydrogen chamber) lightly varied, which is of 99.26–99.52% with the asbestos membrane; however with titanium oxide composite membrane was pound to be 99.48–99.9%. The obtained results has shown that the synthesized titanium oxide composite membrane was gives the high purity of hydrogen and also with increasing the electrolysis time, the hydrogen purity doesn't change because of membrane stability towards the thermal and chemical properties."
18,Conclusion,"In this present study, a novel composite membrane separator was synthesized by phase inversion precipitation technique from polysulfone, PVP and titanium oxide (TiO2). The synthesized TiO2 composite membranes performance evaluated in alkaline water electrolyzer and its performance compared with the commercial asbestos membrane. The obtained results was shown that the synthesized TiO2 composite membranes were showed excellent electrochemical performances which is of a current density 600 mA/cm2 was obtained while compared to asbestos membrane, 50% higher current density and hydrogen purity achieved under the same operating conditions. From the economical and application point of view, the TiO2 composite membranes can be easily mass produced without using any hazardous materials and used only low-cost materials. Hence the synthesized TiO2 composite membranes can be used as the alternative to commercial asbestos membranes in alkaline water electrolysis."
