0,Introduction,"The interferon (IFN) is glycoproteins which produced by cell’s immune system in order to eliminate the existence of pathogens. It was first identified in 1957 by Isaacs and Lindemann [1]. When the viruses enter or invade an individual cell body, the infected cell will respond by producing IFN molecules and releasing it to the neighboring cells. Then, IFNs will react with specific receptors of the neighboring cells to activate the cytoplasmic signals that initiate cellular defensive actions [2,3]. The human IFN can be divided into three major types: alpha, beta and gamma. The alpha type IFN, IFN-α2b was studied in this paper. It was found that IFN-α2b can be effective in treating many diseases, e.g., Hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Condylar acuminate and Chronic hepatitis B [4,5]. As the market of IFN-α2b will continue to grow at a fast pace, the development of an efficient and a cost-effective recovery process is a crucial strategy in IFN production as it will help to reduce the cost of production significantly [6]. The alcohol/salt aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) was first studied by Greve and Kula in 1991 [7]. The alcohol/salt ATPS is formed by two immiscible phases consists of alcohol and salt solutions. In comparison to polymer/salt ATPS, the target protein extracted via alcohol/salt ATPS can be easily recovered by removal of alcohol using evaporation method [8,9]. Besides, alcohol/salt ATPS offers other advantages like low toxicity to environment and inexpensive cost [10] compared to conventional ATPS, which is used of unrecovered polymer, for example, poly-ethyleneglycol (PEG) for the purification and recovery of biomolecules. A lot of purification studies based on alcohol/salt ATPS are available nowadays, for example, the glycyrrhizin extraction from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch using alcohol/salt ATPS achieved a 92% yield of glycyrrhizin with purification factor (P F) of 2.6 [9]. In addition, it has also been applied for the extraction of other biological products such as nucleic acids [12], salvianolic acid B [10], betalains [13] and geniposide [14]. The partition of lipase from Burkholderia pseudomallei in alcohol/salt ATPS has been reported recently [11]. In the study, the purified lipase from B. pseudomallei achieved P F of 13.5 folds. However, up-to-date no study has been attempted for recovery of IFN-α2b using alcohol/salt ATPS from E. coli. ATPS operated challenged with E. coli feedstock would be expected to differ from B. pseudomallei feedstock [11]. In this study, the recovery of IFN-α2b using alcohol/salt ATPS from E. coli. was performed to validate the feasibility and applicability of the system in purification of IFN-α2b. It was found that the yield value (74.64%) of IFN-α2b obtained in this alcohol/salt-based ATPS study was higher than that achieved by previous IFN-α2b purification literature reported using PEG/salt ATPS (40.70%) [15]. Partitioning of target protein into one specific phase can be achieved by manipulating the ATPS properties, the ATPS variables such as system consist of different alcohols and salts, different concentration of alcohol/salt ATPS, and addition of sodium chloride (NaCl) were investigated in this study. The purpose of this study is to present a simple and effective method of purifying IFN-α2b via alcohol/salt ATPS from E. coli crude extract."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ammonium sulfate and monosodium citrate were sourced from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol and di-potassium hydrogen phosphate were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Protein assay kit was obtained from Bio-Rad (California, USA). All chemicals used in this paper are analytical grade."
3,Bacterial strains and plasmid,"2.2 Bacterial strains and plasmid Recombinant E. coli K12 culture, Rosetta-gami2 (DE3) strain which was chosen for IFN-α2b producing host cell as it combines the advantageous features of Origami and Rosetta, which will enhance the disulfide bond formation and expression of eukaryotic proteins. IFN-α2b gene was inserted into pET26b plasmid which consists the resistance gene in opposition to kanamycin, this recombinant plasmid was then inserted into E. coli Rosetta-gami2 (DE3) strain with chloramphenicol resistance gene."
4,Fermentation of recombinant E. coli,"2.3 Fermentation of recombinant E. coli Inoculum was prepared by incubating the recombinant E. coli in 250mL baffled shake flasks containing 50mL Terrific Broth (TB) with 34mg/L chloramphenicol and 30mg/L kanamycin. The inoculum was incubated at 37°C and agitated at 250rpm for 16h in an incubator shaker (Certomat® BS-1 B. Braun, Germany). After the recombinant E. coli culture inoculated with 8% (v/v) inoculum, the culture was then incubated at 37°C, with agitation speed at 250rpm for 4h. The IFN-a2b production was then induced by adding 1mM isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactoside (IPTG, Cat. No. 420322, Calbiochem). Once the IPTG added, the temperature was changed to 30°C with agitation speed at 250rpm, the cells were then harvested after 8h and stored at −20°C until further processing."
5,Cell disruption,"2.4 Cell disruption Osmotic shock was performed to rupture the recombinant E. coli culture cell body, therefore releasing the periplasmic IFN-α2b contained within. The cell pellets were suspended in a buffer solution comprising 20% (w/v) sucrose, 0.03M Tris–HCl, 5mM sodium EDTA (pH 8.0). The mixture was rigorously shaken for 5min to enhance osmotic shock process. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged for 10min at 4000rpm and 4°C. Next, the cell pellets were re-suspended and shaken rapidly in cold ultra-pure for 10min. The mixture was centrifuged again for 10min at 4000rpm and 4°C. The supernatant from centrifuged mixture was collected."
6,ATPS,"2.5 ATPS The predetermined quantities of alcohol and dissolved salts were prepared in a 15mL centrifugal tube. The 1g of crude extract was then added into the mixture to make the ATPS to reach a final total weight of 10g. The phase system was mixed thoroughly by gentle agitation and then subjected to centrifugation at 4000rpm for 10min to speed up the phase separation. After the phase separation, the top and bottom phases were collected, and then the concentrations of total protein and IFN-α2b within the system were analyzed. It was always not easy to evaluate the degree of purification by monitoring partition coefficient of IFN-α2b only. Therefore, the P F (top phase) of the ATPS was evaluated as well (Fig. 1 ). All the experiments were carried out for three times (triplicates) at room temperature. The phase diagrams associated with alcohol/salt systems were referred from previous literature reported by Ooi et al. [11]."
7,Assay of IFN-α2b,"2.6 Assay of IFN-α2b IFN-α2b was quantified by employing the biochip and Fully Automated Surface Plasma Resonance Detection System (BIAcore 3000, GE Healthcare, Sweden) as described in detailed by Ramanan et al. [16]. CM-5 Biosensor Chip (GE Healthcare, Sweden) was bound with anti-αIFN mouse monoclonal antibody (MMHA-2, catalog No. 407290, Merck, USA). Samples were mixed with HBS-EP buffer (10mM HEPES, 150mM NaCl, 3mM EDTA, 0.005% Tween-20) in 1:1 ratio and run through the biochip at 5μL/min flow rate, using response unit (RU) as an output measurement. The IFN-a2b standards (Cat. No. ORP-16029, Affinity Bioreagents, USA) was calibrated using ELISA Kit (Cat. No. RPN2759, GE Healthcare, UK)."
8,Protein analysis,"2.7 Protein analysis The total protein concentration was analyzed by following the user manual of Bio-Rad protein assay kit. In this study, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was employed as standard protein."
9,Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE),"2.8 Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) Protein samples from the crude extract and the top phase in ATPS were analyzed by using SDS–PAGE method. The crude extract sample was separated in an acrylamide gel consisting of 12% resolving gel and 4.5% stacking gel. Top phase and bottom phase sample were performed in acrylamide gel consisting of a 20% resolving gel and 4.5% stacking gel. Electrophoresis was run at 110V and 36mA for approximately 75min. After the electrophoresis, the gel was stained and de-stained as described in a previous publication [17]."
10,Calculation,"2.9 Calculation The volume ratio (V R) was defined as the ratio of volume in the top phase (V T) to the volume of the bottom phase (V B): (1) V R = V T V B The top-phase purification factor (P F) is as the ratio of specific IFN-α2b concentration in the top phase of ATPS to the specific IFN-α2b concentration prior to the purification process. The P F was calculated according to the following equation: (2) P F = (IFN concentration/protein concentration)in top phase (IFN concentration/protein concentration)in crude stock The partition coefficient (K) of the IFN was calculated as the ratio of the IFN concentration in two phases: (3) K = C T C B where C T and C B are the IFN concentration (mg/mL) in the top phase and bottom phase of ATPS, respectively [11]. Yield of IFN in top phase was determined using the following equation: (4) Y T ( % ) = 100 1 + [ 1 / ( V R * K ) ] where K is the partition coefficient and V R is the volume ratio."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Selection of alcohol/salt ATPS,"3.1 Selection of alcohol/salt ATPS The results of P F and yield of IFN-α2b in different alcohol/salt ATPS were shown in Table 1 . Phase diagrams of alcohols against different salts were referred to Ooi et al. [11]. These systems were chosen based on the respective phase diagrams which form V R value of 1.0. A higher yield (%) was achieved in alcohol/K2HPO4 system with the tested alcohols but the respective P Fs of IFN-α2b were relatively lower. The P F results may have influenced by the varying level of pH, as the ammonium sulfate, monosodium citrate and di-potassium hydrogen phosphate pH systems were in the different range of 6.0–6.5, 8.0–8.3 and 9.0–9.5, respectively. Partitioning behavior of IFN-α2b is expected to be sensitive to pH level in ATPS since the IFN is charged molecules [18]. As the pH increase, the IFN yield was observed to be higher but P F become lower. This shows that contaminant proteins and IFN protein were partitioned toward top phase when pH increased; the charge of the proteins may contribute to this phenomenon. The iso-electric point of IFN-α2b is about 5.99, it is negatively charged at these three different pH ranges [19]. At pH 9.0–9.5, more contaminant proteins become negatively charge due to the high pH value, the negatively charged protein would generally tend to partition to the top phase and repelled from the salt-rich bottom phase [8]. Therefore, both contaminant proteins and IFN-α2b partitioned to the top phase and the presence of contaminant proteins at top phase lowered the P F of IFN-α2b. From the results presented in Table 1, it was found that 2-propanol/ammonium sulfate system achieved the highest IFN purity of 12.84 P F with yield of 78.58%. The 2-propanol/ammonium sulfate system was therefore chosen for further optimization in the following experiments."
13,Optimization of 2-propanol/ammonium sulfate ATPS,"3.2 Optimization of 2-propanol/ammonium sulfate ATPS The P F of IFN-α2b in 2-propanol/ammonium sulfate ATPS was investigated by varying difference in concentrations of 2-propanol and ammonium sulfate systematically. As shown in Table 2 , the highest P F of IFN-α2b was observed in 18% (w/w) 2-propanol and 22% (w/w) ammonium sulfate system, with P F of 15.45 and yield of 64.03%. In general, the P F of IFN-α2b generally decreased when the concentration of 2-propanol in the system increased. The increasing concentration of alcohol in the top phase had caused gradual dehydration of top phase and favoring the partition of IFN-α2b to the bottom phase [11]. Therefore, the 18% (w/w) 2-propanol with 22% (w/w) ammonium sulfate system was selected for next study."
14,The effect of NaCl on P F of IFN-α2b,"3.3 The effect of NaCl on P F of IFN-α2b The 18% (w/w) 2-propanol with 22% (w/w) ammonium sulfate system was chosen to study the effect of addition NaCl on P F, at the range of 0% (w/w) to 4% (w/w). According to Zalavsky, addition of neutral salt into ATPS will cause electrical potential difference between two phases and affect the partitioning of biomolecules, the electrostatic potential may driven negatively charged IFN-α2b partition to the top phase [20]. On top of that, the addition of NaCl increase the hydrophobicity difference between both phases by decreasing the amount of bound water, this strengthen the interaction between the IFN-α2b’s hydrophobic surface area and the propanol’s hydrophobic chain thus leading IFN-α2b protein partition to the top phase which is alcohol-rich [15]. Based on the result, maximum P F (16.24) was achieved at 1% (w/w) NaCl (Table 3 )."
15,SDS–PAGE analysis of IFN-α2b,"3.4 SDS–PAGE analysis of IFN-α2b The purity of the highest recovered IFN-α2b was assessed with a SDS–PAGE (Fig. 2 ). The results demonstrated that the feedstock (lane 5) exhibited dense intensity of various bands, indicating a lot of proteins content. Meanwhile, the product recovered from the top phase of optimized alcohol/salt-based ATPS (lane 3) exhibited a major band fell at molecular weight of approximately 19kDa, indicating the IFN-α2b was successfully partitioned to top phase. In general, IFN-α2b has molecular weight of about 19kDa [21]. Several bands between 34 and 43kDa were present in both top (lane 3) and bottom phases (lane 2). This explained by the fact that the salt-rich bottom phase was unable to attract all of the unwanted proteins into the bottom phase."
16,Conclusion,"Recombinant E. coli IFN-α2b was successfully purified by 2-propanol/ammonium sulfate-based ATPS. The optimum condition was achieved in 2-propanol 18% (w/w) with ammonium sulfate 22% (w/w), and 1% (w/w) concentration of NaCl ATPS system. High P F of 16.24 with yield of 74.64% were achieved in single step downstream process. The comparison between different purification studies and the yield of IFN-α2b extraction achieved was shown in Table 4 . With convincing results of high P F and yield, alcohol/salt ATPS could potentially be an alternative to the conventional ATPS for the purification of IFN-α2b from microbial sources."
