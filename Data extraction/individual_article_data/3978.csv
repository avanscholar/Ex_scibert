0,Introduction,"With the awareness of global warming and its devastating effects growing around the globe since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, the relevance of discussing environmental problems has become more intense each year. In this context, notable contributions in the aviation sector have addressed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide. Within the commitments made in 2015, the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) for Brazil, established in 2016, aim to reduce GHG emissions by 37% by 2025 and by 43% by 2030 using 2005 as the basis of comparison [1]. In order to achieve the proposed law-regulated goals, Brazil must draw its attention to the transport sector while the aviation industry should be the next point of focus. Commercially, it is estimated that the aviation market contributes to between 2% and 6% of all GHG emissions worldwide [2,3]. In Brazil, the data from the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) indicates that aviation is only responsible for 0.5% of the total GHG emissions, but the numbers have grown 4.5% per year from 2005 to 2015 considering international flights alone [4,5]. The aviation sector has been in development and expansion with an air traffic rise of 5% being expected by 2030 [6]. The European Union commission, which is in charge of environmental preservation policies, projects that in 2030 emissions caused by aircrafts ought to be 70% higher than in 2005, even with the 2% evolution in fuel efficiency. And for 2050, the projection is between 300% and 700%, even with the combustion efficiency growing by 7% [4]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) affirms that the aviation sector is indeed responsible for 2% to 3% of the planet’s CO2 emissions and that biofuels are valuable assets to preserve the environment and mitigate climate change [7], at same time that the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) pointed out ambitious goals of stabilizing CO2 emissions directly related to the development and exploration of low-carbon renewable energy [8,9]. Recently, RenovaBio was introduced by the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), which is a State policy that sets goals to stimulate the biofuels market and reduce the emission of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. RenovaBio recognizes the strategic role of all biofuels (ethanol, biodiesel, biomethane, biokerosene, second generation, among others) in the Brazilian energy matrix with regard to their contribution to energy security, market predictability and mitigation of emissions greenhouse gases in the fuel sector, assuming the following objectives [10]. ▪ Encouraging the expansion of the biofuel sector; ▪ Complying with the goals determined for Brazil under the Paris Agreement; ▪ Ensuring predictability in the sector, inducing gains, commercialization and use of biofuels. Thus, it is necessary to carry out research that presents the potential benefits that can be achieved in the biodiesel sector by diversifying production in biorefinery complexes, like in Brazil, there is a need to explore different oil crops because the main raw material currently used is the soybean, which presents low oil productivity per hectare when compared to palm oil. Although Palm oil is the most produced vegetable oil in the world [11], it does not effectively contribute to the Brazilian national energy matrix as its oil is mainly utilized for food purposes and accounts for only 0.55% of the biodiesel feedstock in the country. In addition, the residues from its extraction are not used properly [12,13]. These are currently applied in the soil as fertilizers used as animal feed and burned in low-efficiency boilers [14]. In this sense, different works have been carried out with a focus on the transportation and aviation sectors: Concerning the Brazilian transportation sector, Vaskan et al. [15] explored two biorefineries based in residual palm biomass in order to produce ethanol and energy and demonstrate the capacity of 84% reduction in emissions. In addition Ocampo Batlle et al. [16] integrated pyrolysis technology to improve the palm oil biodiesel biorefineries production and environmental performance. In the context of the aviation sector challenges for renewable fuel development and implementation, this work aims to evaluate different technologies – Hydrotreatment of Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) – to produce bio-jet fuels of first and second-generation in integrated biorefinery scenarios placed in Brazil. Studies on different ways of exploring palm oil are common in the literature since it is the most produced vegetable oil in the world as the exploitation of the production of renewable jet fuels from palm in a standalone facility, such as the work of Vasquez et al. [17], Dujjanutat and Kaewkannetra [18] and Lin et al. [19]. Therefore, this work explores palm oil and the residual biomass of oil palm extraction to obtain valuable products via sustainable routes in integrated biorefineries. Taking into account that the selection and integration of processes carried out in a biorefinery will impact the overall efficiency of the system, the production costs and the impacts on the environment of the plant. It is necessary to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the system that allows characterizing and quantify the energy, economic and environmental aspects related to the bio-jet fuel production being added to the most common business model for palm-to-energy in Brazil, the biodiesel plants. An analysis methodology was proposed to address all these aspects and to provide results that allow for guiding in decision-making regarding technology selection. In the present work, using the thermodynamic models developed for the different biorefinery schemes considered, it was possible to quantify the use of resources and compare the conversion efficiencies of the different case studies. Bearing in mind that these systems involve significant interactions of heat and work between their components, it was necessary to carry out a second law analysis in order to identify the processes in which the greatest destruction of exergy occurs in order to identify where the greatest irreversibility occurs in the processes. Additionally, it is necessary to keep in mind that the economic performance and environmental problems of the different process can influence the performance of the thermodynamic system. Thus, in addition to the thermodynamic evaluation, the economic and environmental considerations must be investigated in the designing of the process. The most common methods for simultaneously evaluating the technical, financial, and environmental aspects of each thermodynamic system are Exergy, Exergoeconomic and Life Cycle Assessment. Exergoeconomics can be considered an effective tool to solve problems in complex energy systems that can hardly ever or not even be solved using conventionalenergy analysis techniques. Thermoeconomics can play an important role in the analysis of industrial symbiosis examples for two reasons: (i) the use of exergy (able to quantify both energy and matter streams in physical units taking their different quality into account) and (ii) it is a systemic and rigorous approach [20]. Exergoeconomic analysisprovides a correlation of the product cost and the exergy invested and destroyed in the designed system. It can provide the alternative solution to manage and design the system. The environmental impacts of an energy conversion system can be evaluated through a Life Cycle Assessment. However, when distributing costs or environmental loads in a multiproduct system, the issue of allocation emerges. Allocation is necessary when more than one product is obtained in a system, and the emissions of this process have to be attributed to individual products. Allocation is a very controversial and important step in LCA as it presents a strong influence on results and can lead to economic or political choices. In LCA studies, allocation is generally based on the economic value of the material flow, or on mass basis. Some food LCA studies use fat,energyor protein contents to allocate environmental impacts. However, the most common approach in LCA studies is to avoid allocation altogether, by system expansion [21]. For the different systems considered, the environmental loads were calculated using exergy allocation factors because this method produces an equally accurate result to allocate environmental loads in multiproduct systems."
1,General overview,"Bio-jet fuels (BJF) are renewable aviation fuels also known as Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK). These biofuels are hydrocarbons with properties similar to those of conventional jet fuels produced from fossil sources. The combustion of these renewable fuels can mitigate CO2 emissions. In addition, their compositions present advantages such as lower sulfur content and better energy density and freezing point [22]. The International Association of Air Transport (IATA) counted 150,000 commercial flights fueled with renewable fuels in 2018 [23], and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) projected that in 2020, the production scale would reach 450 Mt of bio-jet fuel [24]. Moreover, the IATA also committed itself to reducing the carbon footprint associated with aircraft emissions by promoting the use of sustainable alternative fuels instead of conventional jet fuel [25]. The Hydrotreatment of Ester and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process is one of the four certified routes to produce jet fuels from renewable sources [2]. Hydrotreatment or Hydroprocessing is a series of catalytic reaction mechanisms initiated by the presence of hydrogen and is considered the most developed route to produce renewable aviation fuel. This process produces around 2.4% of all bio-jet fuels produced worldwide [26] and consists of two catalytic reactions. In the first reaction, the feedstock oil has its oxygen content removed by hydrogen pumping, which reduces the acidity and viscosity of the oil. The oxygen removal also contributes to the miscibility of the biofuel in the fossil fuel. At the end of the reaction, a linear chain of hydrocarbons with a high freezing point is formed. The standards require at least 99.5% of carbon and hydrogen in the final fuel [9,22,27]. This intermediate hydrocarbon chain follows to the second stage, in which it is cracked and isomerized in order to improve flow properties at low temperatures and achieve the right range of hydrocarbons to blend with the fossil fuel. After the separation, usually using distillation columns, naphtha and green diesel (HVO) are co-products of the process along with the Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene [9]. The Alcohol-to-Jet, ATJ, process is one of the certified processes used in acquiring BJF from renewable sources. The technique consists of converting sugary, starchy, and lignocellulosic alcohols into drop-in jet fuels or a blendstock specification [28]. The series of chemical reactions to achieve the standards for bio-jet fuels comprises dehydration, oligomerization, and hydroprocessing with distillation at the end [2,29,30]. The alcohol is dehydrated into an olefin as ethanol becomes ethylene at high temperatures and in the presence of a catalyst. The olefins pass through the oligomerization at high pressure and temperature, producing a middle distillate that follows to the hydroprocessing where jet fuel range hydrocarbons are obtained. After the separation, the distillate products are the BJF and the paraffinic renewable diesel, also known as Synthetized Iso-Paraffins (SIP) [18,1]. According to Wei et al. [32], the HEFA process is being demonstrated for the commercialization stage, and the ATJ is under development for commercialization. In terms of the Technical Readiness Level, the HEFA process is at level 8 and the ATJ is at level 6 [29]. In general, the ASTM ruled the requirements of quality and standards for the BJF properties, such as density, heating value, cetane number, viscosity, and flash point. These should be equivalent to the properties offered by the fossil fuels used on aircrafts, however, with a considerable inferior environmental burden [31]. Diederichs et al. [26] compared the production chain of BJF from lignocellulose, sugarcane juice, and vegetable oils, finding that the second-generation jet fuels, from the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, presented higher economic viability and that the dependence on the feedstock cost had the greatest influence on this matter. Klein et al. [33] compared hydrotreatment route, the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) route to obtain the BJF using the biomass from the sugarcane industry as feedstock. The results pointed out that the Fischer-Tropsch process was the most economically viable, although it has the lowest production rate among the processes. The vegetable oil hydrotreatment had the best conversion efficiency and the highest production volume. Moreover, the authors reported that, environmentally, the studied fuels could mitigate GHG emissions by 70% compared to fossil jet fuels. The work by Vasquez et al. [17] explored four scenarios using soybean and palm oils as feedstock for the production of BJF by the HEFA. In these scenarios, some constraints over the logistic and economic feasibility were found in addition to the immaturity of the technologies. The most highlighted result resides in the improvement of the environmental and energetic indicators of the life cycle in the scenarios that considered the addition of renewable hydrogen production along with that of the BJF. Dujjanutat and Kaewkannetra [18] considered refined palm oil and palm kernel oil to produce BJF exploring the hydrotreatment route. The authors found the optimal condition at 477 °C and 5.6 MPa, reaching biofuel conversion rate around 90%, and biokerosene selectivity of 49.59% for palm kernel oil and 55.35% for refined palm oil. Martinez-Hernandez et al. [34] evaluated the uncertainty of economic input parameters by means of the Monte Carlo simulations, which help to found the minimum selling price for Bio-Jet fuels from palm oil, which was 1.35 USD/L. Despite being the technology that is most ready and that presents the most competitive prices while yielding a higher amount of fuel, the HEFA’s production costs are unlikely to decline further in the future as it deals with high-cost feedstock: vegetable and waste oils. In terms of investment, HEFA fuels may be a dead end, and in spite of apparently being the best option at the moment, the expansion of the practice shall not facilitate a transition to better-performing, lignocellulosic feedstock–derived fuels in the longer term [35], which leads to the interest in exploring the ATJ route as well. Moretti et al. [36] presented a novel ATJ route in which the sugar fermentation is substituted by acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation for the Netherlands scenario. The results indicated that the production costs were not competitive. However, they could be reduced by 10% by scaling up the plats, and by 5 to 23% by means of improving the conversion rate of the fermentation. In a minimum fuel selling price and greenhouse gas emissions analysis, Tanzil et al. [37] identify how much the costs of bio-jet fuels can be reduced by expanding corn and corn stover ethanol plants to biorefineries. The reduction may vary from 3 to 67% by integrating technologies, highlighting that the ATJ technology is capable of presenting lower costs of production, 1.36 USD/L, which the authors attributed to the ethanol being purchased and not produced, resulted in a 92% reduction in the fixed cost investment along with reductions also in the operation costs. In Geleynse et al. [38] economic models for the ATJ pathway using both an ethanol and an isobutanol were built. These models identified that the major drawback for this technology is the cost of production of the intermediate alcohol, especially ethanol, which can account for 80% of the final jet fuel production costs."
2,Case studies,"There is a large spectrum of work done in the sugarcane and starch biomass industries addressing biorefineries in Brazil. This is because such biorefineries are called conventional and have a higher standard from the development perspective: most of them have a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 9, which indicates established operation and market. Meanwhile, a biorefinery that explores the products of a palm oil mill may be classified as an oleochemical biorefinery or a lignocellulosic feedstock biorefinery, with a TRL from 6 to 9, pointing to a pre-commercial stage and emergent technologies [39]. With that said, and in assuming that a palm oil biorefinery may be classified as an oleochemical or lignocellulosic biorefinery, the technologies incorporated into the baseline scenario were on the same level of technical readiness. The HEFA route, an emergent technology, does not require much adaptation in order to be integrated into the base case and complete the structure and configuration of Scenario 1. For Scenario 2, the ATJ technology, which is a developing technology, was brought to the case studies to be compared with the performance of the HEFA. However, for the ATJ to operate, it is necessary to produce ethanol first and then decide to use a technology that is already commercial (TRL 9 [40]) for this scenario: the second-generation ethanol plant. The biorefineries were set to work with different configurations, such as: ▪ Baseline scenario: is the current Brazilian business case of conventional biodiesel production from palm oil via transesterification. Considers only the integrating of the palm oil mill (POM), the refining and transesterification (R&T) plant and the cogeneration station (COG) responsible for supplying the energy demand of the processes. In this scenario, all residual biomass is available for cogeneration. All of the palm oil extracted goes to the R&T plant, in which the transesterification reaction occurs by the methyl route. The COG station works with 55 MW of power and, after supplying the entire process, a considerable amount of surplus electricity is available for selling; ▪ Scenario 1: Considers the structure described in the baseline scenario plus the HEFA plant coupled to it. The HEFA plant and the R&T plant are to supplied both with half the amount of palm oil extract from POM, and the cogeneration supplies the processes; ▪ Scenario 2: Considers the structure of the baseline scenario in addition to two different plants: the second-generation ethanol (E2G) plant and the ATJ plant for producing bio-jet fuels. The cellulosic feedstock explored in the ethanol plant consists of the empty fruit bunches, which is one of the palm oil extraction side-products of the mill. For this case, the biodiesel plant operates via the ethylic route. The ethanol produced in the second-generation ethanol plant serves the 15 ton/h of palm oil being processed in the R&T plant before feeding the ATJ plant. The biorefinery has iso-paraffinic green diesel (SIP) and ATJ BJF as different products. Fig. 1 presents the configuration of the case studies indicating which scenario works with which technology. Supplementary Material A presents the data for mass and energy balances of each stage of the biorefineries. In a previous work [41], the integrated production of bio-jet fuel from both ATJ and HEFA technologies was elaborated on regarding a biorefinery in a detailed analysis. The biomass processed in the milling stage, in the POM, corresponds to the Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB). These are broken to extract the palm oil and yield the residual solid biomass with energetic value. The different types of biomass are the Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB), Palm Kernel Shells (PKS), and Fibers. The system conditions and the operating parameters of the POM, R&T, HEFA, E2G, ATJ and COG are presented in Table 1 ."
3,Methodology,"The methodology pathway defined by this work is illustrated in Fig. 2 . And, in sequence, is described stage by stage how was elaborated. Stage 1 – Biomass selection and characterization: This stage is necessary to gather data on biomass composition, productivity and energy potential. With this information, it is possible to define the current and future technological alternatives that can be a choice for their energy conversion aim the expansion of products diversification or enhancing the current production scale. Stage 2 – Definition of case studies: With the information on the current and future state of the technologies that can be used and integrated in the biorefinery complex, it is possible to analyze different scenarios related to fuel, energy and food production. This allows for the creation of different case studies that can be analyzed and compared in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages that each type of technology may have. Stage 3 – Technical analysis: In this stage, mass, energy and exergy balances of the whole plant are carried out in order to know how the raw material is used in the different production processes. Based on the obtained results, it is possible to establish different performance indicators that can be used to select the technologies that allow for achieving the highest biomass conversion efficiencies. Stage 4 – Exergoconomic analysis: At this stage, carrying out an exergoeconomic analysis allows to know the impact that the irreversibility present in the different conversion processes has on the final costs of the plant products (unit monetary an exergetic cost). This analysis also makes it possible to identify the production processes that need to be improved and to identify those aspects that most contribute to the environmental impacts of the products obtained. Stage 5 – Conventional economic analysis: With the monetary unit cost calculated that reflects the thermodynamic efficiency of the different production process integrated in the biorefinery, it is possible to make a conventional economic evaluation to calculate the business model attractiveness. Stage 6 – Environmental analysis: To identify the main environmental impacts of energy-related industries, it is necessary to quantify these impacts through Life Cycle Assessment. As such, it is possible to identify the main environmental impacts associated with each case study. The potential impacts of the product or whole system, from raw material extraction through production would be measured with a coherent choice of impact calculation method, correct inventory elaboration, definition of the impact categories assessed (global warming potential, ozone layer depletion, etc.) andcalculation of the allocation factors. For the present work, with the gathered data and the defined biorefinery process mentioned in Section 2, the model for simulation was built using the software GateCycle v6.2.1 to simulate the plant operation and solve mass and energy balances. The technical indicators were calculated by advent of the thermodynamic laws and comprehend the thermodynamic efficiencies and exergy destruction rates in each plant. The exergy balances were assembled with the investment estimates which were conducted by means of a cost-capacity balance. The total investment costs were allocated by employing the exergetic cost theory [48–50]. The monetary costs from exergoeconomics analysis were then compared to the average Brazilian market prices from 2015 to 2020; and, the economic evaluation addressed the viability of each enterprise, considering the floating and uncertainty of the market, which is another gap that needs filling in the biorefinery field, by way of executing a sensitivity analysis; Finally, a life cycle analysis was carried out to identify which biorefinery configuration is best fit for bio-jet fuel production in terms of environmental impacts and highlights if the choice of production chain studied herein provide environmental gain compared to conventional transportation fuels or not. The main tools to evaluate and identify the drawbacks regarding the production of biofuels under biorefinery scenarios were used in order to achieve this work’s results. Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of the computational procedure adopted and the resources used. In summary, the data available on literature were used to feed the simulation, mass and energy balances, and all of these were used to obtain the economic, thermodynamic, exergoeconomic and environmental indicators for each biorefinery scheme. In the following subsections the methodology used is explored in detail."
4,Technical analysis,"4.1 Technical analysis 4.1.1 Thermodynamic performance indicators Through mass and energy balances, it is possible to identify the specific net surplus electricity (ES) represented in Eq. (1) by the ratio between the Net Electric Power (EP) generated and the feedstock input in the biorefinery (tCFF), which indicates the amount of electricity per ton of feedstock available to be sold to the grid. (1) η Ger = E P t FFB ( k W h / t FFB ) Thermodynamic analysis by the First Law allows for calculating the electric efficiency of a cogeneration system (ηGer), calculated with Eq. (2), where EP is Net Electric Power and Efuel is total energy provided by biomass burnt in the boiler. (2) η Ger = E P E fuel Additionally, there is the global efficiency (ηGlobal) of the biorefineries considering all products obtained in each scenario. In Eq. (3), EP is Net Electric Power, and chemical exergy Eproducts represents the amount of energy produced by biofuels; Efeedstock is Fresh Fruit Bunches, energy content. (3) η Global = E P + ∑ E products ∑ E feedstock Additionally, an exergy analysis was carried out, calculating every exergy flow in the biorefineries based on the method put forth by Szargut, Morris and Steward [51]. Equation (4) was used to calculate the solid biomass chemical factor, Eq. (5) to calculate the liquid hydrocarbons chemical factor and Eq. (6) to calculate liquid compounds with carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, such as both ethanol and methanol’s chemical factor [50]. These equations determine the dimensionless factor β of biomass and fuels by its elementary composition sample. Its chemical exergy is calculated using Eq. (7). The correspondent references for the chemical composition for the chemical exergy calculation are presented along with the results presented in Table 2 , and the references for the chemical composition are presented in Table B.1 of Supplementary Material B.

Additionally, exergy efficiency (ζ), for cogeneration power generation, whole plant and exergy destruction are calculated by using Eqs. (6)–(8), respectively. Cogeneration power generation exergy efficiency (ζGer) is calculated by using Equation (6) by the ration between Net Electric Power (EP) and Total exergy of fuel burnt in the cogeneration boiler (Exfuel). (8) ζ Ger = E P Ex fuel Global plant exergy efficiency (ζGlobal), calculated by Eq. (7), considers all of the products fed to biorefinery scenario in exergy base. Therefore, Eger is the electricity produced in the system; Exbioproducts is the total exergy of all biorefinery output; and Exfeedstock is the total exergy of all feedstock fed to the biorefinery.

Q̇CV is the time rate of exergy transfer accompanying heat transfer at the rate occurring at the location on the boundary, where the instantaneous temperature is Tj; ẆCV represents the time rate of energy transfer rate by work (kW); ṁ(exin - exout) accounts for the time rate of exergy transfer accompanying the mass flow and flow work at inlet and outlet (kW). With all of the exergy flows calculated, it is possible to calculate the exergy costs of each product based on the exergoeconomic allocation method. This method combines the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which is suitable for analyzing different energy products and economic concepts in order to provide the Exergy and Monetary costs [52,53]."
5,Investment estimates analysis,"4.2 Investment estimates analysis Investment in the construction and installation of the biorefineries must be determined. There is data in the literature that is calculated based on plant capacity for all processes that are analyzed in the biorefineries, thus these values may be applied to the present study by means of a cost-capacity balance (Eq. (7)), as carried out by Furtado-Júnior et al. [44]. (11) Cost 2 = Cost 1 Capacity 2 Capacity 1 α CEPCI Oct . 2019 CEPCI Ref . d a t e In this equation, Cost2 and Capacity2 refer to the cost of the equipment in this work corrected by the CEPCI indices and commonly used for engineering plant economic accountability and originated from Chemical Engineering Magazine [54]. Variable α is a balance factor and the value of 0.6 is commonly used for integrated process plants and power generation [44]. The investment costs of reference (Cost 1) are presented in Table 3 along with the CEPCI of the reference date, the corrected investment, capacities, and the hourly costs to be applied in the thermoeconomic model. The hourly cost Z (USD/h) is calculated by Eq. (8) based on the corrected cost of investment (I), the variable and fixed operation costs (O&MV and O&MF), the annual working hours (H), the lifespan of the plant (n), and interest rate (j). (12) Z = j . ( 1 + j ) n ( 1 + j ) n - 1 . I + O & M F + O & M V H"
6,Exergoeconomic models,"4.3 Exergoeconomic models Palacio [52] apply a productive diagram, providing a mathematical representation of a productive structure. In such a diagram, rectangles are in fact subsystems or units representing the system’s real process/equipment; fictitious units named as junctions and bifurcation are represented by rhombus and circles, respectively [53]. In regards to calculations of cost balance, Eq. (9) is used in productive structure considering every subsystem (13) ∑ c out . Y out - ∑ c in . Y in = Z ̇ + c f . Q ̇ f Being monetary unit cost flow represented by cout and cin at the subsystem’s outlet and inlet, respectively; and internal flows (in MW) of total exergy, for this case, at outlet and inlet of each subsystem are respectively Yout and Yin; Cost per hour ($/h) is Ż for every subsystem including all costs: capital, operational and maintenance. System external exergy consumption is represented in MW by Qf, and cf is external fuel cost per exergy unit. In all consideration the subsystems cost due to the capital cost, operation and maintenance must be zero and for exergy unit cost calculation represented by kin and kout for each flow; all of these consider monetary unit cost of external fuel exergy is replaced by exergy unit cost [57]. (14) ∑ k out . Y out - ∑ k in . Y in = k f . Q ̇ f In order to allocate the unit cost of every product in the biorefinery scenarios in the exergoeconomic analysis; the productive diagram is built, as a didactic contribution that helps in the identification of the cost formation in each sub-system or process. The cost balance of each unit presented in the productive diagram results in a cost balance model based on Eq. (9), for which each one of the subsystems has a specific equation according to the entering and exiting stream of these units. The productive diagram along with the exergoeconomic models for all the scenarios are presented in the Supplementary Material C."
7,Economic evaluation,"4.4 Economic evaluation Once the monetary costs are obtained, these values are used as production costs to be compared with the average market prices in Brazil from 2015 to 2020. A potential income is additionally calculated. The potential revenue was estimated based on the commercialization of produced biofuels and calculated by using Eq. (11). As proposed by Coronado [58], where PR is the Potential Revenue, Q is the quantity of fuel produced, H is the working hours in a year, MP is the average market price, and c is the production cost. (15) PR fuel = Q . H . ( MP fuel - c fuel ) The revenue associated with the selling of surplus electricity to the grid was calculated as per Eq. (12) and also based on the work by Coronado [58]. The difference is that the energy provided to the processes must count as an income. (16) PR El = El supply . H . MP ele - c ger + El surplus . H . ( MP ele - c ger ) PREl is the potential income due to electricity commercialization, H is the hours of operation for the biorefinery, MPele is the market price for power commercialization, controlled by Brazilian National Agency for Electrical Energy (ANEEL), cger is the cost of electricity generation in the plants, and Elsupply and Elsurplus are the amounts of energy supplied to the adjacent processes and surplus available for commercialization, respectively. Therefore, the total income of a biorefinery is the sum of the revenues with biofuel production and power generation. The economic analysis points out which biorefinery has the best financial viability, with the viability of an investment being associated with the return that it would provide. Any investment may have its viability analyzed with the calculation of the Net Present Value (NPV) and Payback Period (PBP) as per Eqs. (13) and (14), respectively. The NPV indicates whether the investment is attractive or not, while the PBP is the period of time after which the initial investment should be recovered and is calculated by the cash flow of each period lifespan of the biorefinery which is divided into years in this case. However, to calculate the NPV and the payback period, the initial investment and annual revenues must first be calculated in order to determine the cash flows. In addition, some parameters for the analysis of attractiveness should be known, such as taxes, project lifespan, and depreciation. These parameters are displayed in Table 4 . (17) N P V = ∑ n = 1 25 Cash F l o w ( 1 + j ) n (18) PBP = A + Cash F l o w A Cash F l o w A + 1 4.4.1 Investment modalities The investments to build the biorefineries were evaluated from two points of view. Modality one considers that the cogeneration system is constructed with all of the plants for biomass processing. Meanwhile, modality two does not consider the investment of building the cogeneration system. Rather, it considers that a system already exists that could be adapted to the work conditions presented in the case studies. Hence, when evaluated by modality two, the plants shall have a lower initial investment than when evaluated by modality one."
8,Life cycle analysis,"4.5 Life cycle analysis In the environmental evaluation using the life cycle assessment (LCA), all aspects of operation in the biorefinery shall be considered. To produce the oil along with the residual biomass and the effluents, there are a few processes that involve heat and electric power [59]. The same occurs for the processes that involve ethanol production and ethanol upgrading into BJF [46,59]. The life cycle inventories (LCI) were gathered for each process to assess their environmental impacts. The selected method was IMPACT 2002 + from SimaPro 8.0, which by means of the Ecoinvent 3 library, allows all of the inputs to be used in the processes (catalysts, reagents, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and etc.) to be assessed. For the LCA of the biorefineries, it is necessary to define the criteria of the methodology: ▪ Scope and Goals: The scope of this analysis is cradle-to-gate, which focuses on the production of the biofuels. Therefore, the final use of the products is not addressed and neither is its disposal. This work aims to point out whether or not there is any environmental gain from these biofuel acquisition routes, concerning all of the categories of the IMPACT 2002 + method; ▪ Allocation method: all of the environmental impact categories, as midpoint and endpoint, were allocated by the exergy flows of the system which are presented in the Table in Supplementary Material E, in Table E.1; ▪ Functional unit: the input and output data were based on a reference flow of 1 ton of FFB (1 t FFB) for the assembly of LCIs. The inventories are presented in Supplementary Material E; ▪ System boundaries and limitations: These are set from the palm cultivation stage at the biorefineries, i.e. they exclude the application of biofuel and electricity as energy providers."

10,Thermodynamic evaluation,"5.1 Thermodynamic evaluation Global first-law efficiency is not a suitable indicator by which to analyze multi-product biorefineries because different types of energy are evaluated. However, in this case, this parameter illustrates some occurrences: the global energy efficiency is higher in the baseline scenario (43.12%) than in Scenarios 1 and 2 (36.62% and 32.45%, respectively) due to the higher amount of biofuel and surplus electricity produced in the baseline scenario (Table 5 ). The amount of oil is divided in half to feed the biodiesel plant and the HEFA plant in Scenario 1. As the HEFA conversion rate is lower than the transesterification rate, the amount of biofuel produced in Scenario 1 is reduced. In Scenario 2, as transesterification occurs in the ethyl route, the oil input capacity is the same as Scenario 1. With this, the amount of biofuel produced for this scenario is also lower than that of the base case since the conversion of ethanol in the ATJ plants is very low (31% and 15%, respectively) [22,60]. The electric power generation efficiency for the first law indicates the system with the best efficiency as being the same with the lowest fuel consumption. The baseline scenario has a boiler consumption of 14 kg/s of biomass mixture (PKS, MF, and EFB), an amount that is self-sufficient and accounts for 22.24% of the power generation efficiency. Scenario 2 consumes 14.19 kg/s of biomass mixture, considering 3.11 kg/s of supplementary biomass since 6.42 kg/s of EFB were converted into second-generation ethanol. With a similar fuel consumption, the power generation achieved is 18.38%. And Scenario 1, with the higher boiler fuel consumption of 17.95 kg/s (0.45 kg/s supplementary), showed an efficiency of 15.9%. A graphical representation of the efficiencies is presented in Fig. D.1 of Supplementary Material D. The exergy efficiencies are associated with the amount of fuel produced along with the surplus electricity. However, the most important parameter to associate with the global and generation exergy efficiencies is the exergy destruction. Table 6 presents the quantity of destroyed exergy for each process of each biorefinery. There are differences in the exergy destruction for each cogeneration system that must be addressed for heat generation since the power generation efficiency is around 28% and 30% for all three scenarios. In considering all of the processes involved in the refineries, the most considerable exergy destruction resides in Scenario 2. The Ethanol Plant is a huge source of irreversibility due to the series of chemical reactions required in order to accomplish the fuel necessary. However, the ATJ plant shows only 8.57 MW of exergy destruction. Put in perspective, there is 1.04 MW of irreversibility for each m3/h of BJF produced and an exergy efficiency for the process of 23%. Moreover, the lowest global exergy efficiency in the biorefineries is 49% for Scenario 2, with 68% and 54% for the baseline scenario and Scenario 1, respectively. Fig. 4 presents the global exergy efficiency of the biorefineries and the distribution of destroyed exergy for each case."
11,Exergoeconomic evaluation,"5.2 Exergoeconomic evaluation Thermoeconomics is a theory that unites the Second Law of Thermodynamics and Economic concepts to evaluate and optimize energy systems. When biorefinery scenarios are evaluated by this methodology, the use of exergy in flows is suitable to treat the multi-production common to such plants, so the analysis is exergoeconomic. However, it is first necessary to know every thermodynamic property of the system along with the operational structure. With all of this, the productive diagram is built to establish the input–output concept, elaborate the thermoeconomic model, and consequently obtain the exergoeconomic costs [21]. Based on the productive diagram presented in Supplementary Material C, the exergy and monetary costs of the main products of each scenario were allocated. The produced biodiesel has a lower exergy cost in the baseline scenario in which a higher volume is produced: 1.251 MWfeedstock/MWBiodiesel. In the other scenarios, the same amount of biodiesel is produced, but the costs are different because of the alcohol that reacts with the palm oil in the transesterification: methanol for Scenario 1 and ethanol for Scenario 2. The ethylic transesterification consumes more ethanol and destroys more exergy; therefore, the exergy cost is higher for this scenario: 1.759 MWfeedstock/MWBiodiesel. Due to its already mentioned low conversion rate and exergy efficiency, the ethanol plant has a cost superior to that of biodiesel production. The exergy cost for ethanol production in Scenario 2 is 4.95 MWfeedstock/MWEthanol . The high irreversibility indices shown in Table 8 should be addressed as another cause of such a high cost. In addition, this causes a domino effect on the cost of ATJ BJF, which is much higher than the BJF produced by the HEFA route (13.62 MWfeedstock/MWBiojet and 3.32 MWfeedstock/MWBiojet, respectively) even with the difference in technology maturity reported by Alves et al. [29]. The exergy cost of power generation is more complex to evaluate. For the baseline scenario, Scenario 1, and Scenario 2, the costs are respectively 5.16 MWfeedstock/MWPower, 7.43 MWfeedstock/MWPower, and 7.28 MWfeedstock/MWPower. The scenario with the highest irreversibility index for power generation is Scenario 1, which has the highest exergy cost and specific consumption. This is a pattern that the other scenarios also follow, so the lower exergy cost in the baseline case occurs together with the lower specific biomass consumption and exergy destruction. In addition, the unit monetary cost of power generation varies with the exergy efficiency of the cogeneration system. In the scenario with the best efficiency (Scenario 1), the cost is the lowest: 70.48 USD/MWh. Moreover, with the worst efficiency (Scenario 2, only 27.7%), the cost is the highest at 88.61 USD/MWh. Supplementary Material D presents graphical representation for the obtained exergy costs of biofuels in the three biorefineries (Fig. D.2) and for the power generation (Figs. D.3 and D.4). The monetary costs for biodiesel were obtained in USD/L and indicated that, in contrast to the exergy cost allocation, the ethylic route should be prioritized. The monetary costs for biodiesel production are not sensitive to the volume of biodiesel produced. The costs for the baseline scenario and Scenario 1 are both 0.33 USD/L, while the cost for Scenario 2 is 0.28 USD/L. This happens because the ethanol that reacts in the transesterification was produced in the biorefinery, thus fewer costs are associated with external resources. These costs are all lower than the breakeven cost reported by Kermani et al. [61] of 0.36 USD/L for conventional palm biodiesel production and 0.41 USD/L for biodiesel production in a biorefinery scenario, both of which use methanol as the reagent. The most profitable biodiesel from palm oil in the biorefinery scenario presented by Harahap et al. [62] had a cost of 0.57 USD/L, considerably higher than the cost found in the present work, while Xia and Tang [63] reported 0.66 USD/L. For the BJF, the HEFA technology showed a great advantage over the ATJ route. The difference relative to the monetary costs is smaller than that of the exergy costs but indicates that the HEFA route is more ready for market. The cost for BJF in the HEFA process for Scenario 1 was 0.49 USD/L, while the BJF from ATJ in Scenario 2 had a cost of 5.15 USD/L. The breakeven prices calculated for the HEFA processing of generic vegetable oils by Martinez-Hernandez et al. [34] and Diederichs et al. [26] were higher than the values obtained here. The studies by Klein et al. [33] and Zech et al. [64] applied palm oil to hydrotreatment in order to obtain bio-jet fuels, and the production costs found by those studies were 0.66 USD/L and 1.01 USD/L, respectively. The conditions in each study were different, so the economic feasibility of each may differ from one another and the results presented in the present study. The justification in the work of Klein et al. [33] for its high costs are that the supply chain for aviation fuels must be optimized in more than one aspect. Furthermore, if producing first generation biofuels from vegetable oils, it is very important the place where the farming stage is carried. In spite of this, Zech et al.’s work [64] and the high expenses of hydrogen expenses and the load of working hours were the factors blamed regarding the non-competitiveness of the bio-jet fuels with fossil fuels. In face of each valuable input that the literature provides, there is the necessity to consider decarbonization credits in a future analysis of biofuels to search for profitability since the policies regarding carbon emission tend to be more restrictive every year in terms of what shall favor biofuels. In the published studies that explore the ATJ route, it is common to use corn and sugarcane biomass to produce the ethanol and then the BJF by ATJ technology. In the study by Tao et al. [65], corn stover was used as feedstock to produce second-generation ethanol and then iso-paraffinic jet fuel. The selling prices for no profit calculated by the authors were nearly 50% lower for ethanol production and 68,5% inferior for BJF than the one here calculated by exergoeconomic allocation. These values, low in comparison with the present study, can be associated with the corn stover, low-cost biomass, and the investment costs associated with the plant evaluated, which has a production capacity three times lower. For the sugarcane feedstock in the studies by Diederichs et al. [26] and Klein et al. [33], the bio-jet fuel from alcohol also had production costs inferior when compared to the one presented in this work when both use ethanol as the feedstock to be upgraded to the aircraft fuel range. The occurrence of the lower costs in these studies can be related to the thesis also defended by Tanzil et al. [37], that the purchasing of ethanol has been proven to be more economically advantageous than the producing and upgrading of a single plant. Braz and Mariano [66] explored the ATJ technology using enzymatic hydrolysis to produce ethanol and butanol from eucalyptus chips and then upgrade it to BJF in biorefineries. The authors only found the costs to produce BJF, and the values for the ethanol and butanol procedures that were not competitive with fossil fuels were respectively 2.10 USD/L and 3.01 USD/L. Moreover, the authors added that among the renewable sources of jet fuel, eucalyptus could be competitive. However, due to the high investments in this kind of plant, there is need for incentive and premium programs for undertakings regarding this being profitable and competitive with fossil fuels. The comparisons between the herein found costs and the reports from the available literature are shown in Fig. 5 ."
12,Economic evaluation,"5.3 Economic evaluation The potential annual revenue was calculated by considering the allocated monetary costs of each biofuel and the surplus electricity as production costs and evaluating the historical prices of the Brazilian market for such products. The price history comprises the period from 2015 to 2020. The average market price is presented in Table 7 along with the production costs of fuels, glycerol, bio-naphtha, and electricity. Given the revenues calculated, the corrected cost of investment from Table 3, and the investment parameters presented in Table 4, it is possible to evaluate the attractiveness of the investment on the biorefineries by calculating the NPV. The comparison between the modalities shall favor the second one. Since there is a decrease of 325.57 million dollars in the initial investment, the NPV values for the second modality showed more attractiveness than those calculated for the first modality criteria. This is because there is a great change in the revenues by disregarding the costs with the installation and construction of the cogeneration unit. Considering all of the changes between modalities, this analysis shows that the baseline scenario is more attractive, and the worst scenario in economic terms is Scenario 1, which had the worst NPV even with better revenues than Scenario 2. This is justified by the high installation cost required by the HEFA structure. The first modality of investment only presented negative values for the NPV, so there is no return on investment foreseen for the 25 years of the biorefinery lifespan. Conversely, the second modality showed positive NPV numbers, and the PBP values for the baseline scenario, Scenario 1, and Scenario 2 were, respectively, 4 years, 18 years, and 6 years. 5.3.1 Sensitivity analysis The previously calculated economic index cannot reproduce the market behavior through the entire lifespan of the plant, but rather only at a specific moment. Hence, the calculation of the NPV was submitted to a sensitivity analysis that varied multiple economic parameters to indicate which one had more influence on the attractiveness of each scenario. This analysis was carried out for both investment modalities. The results presented similar behaviors for all three biorefineries in both of the modalities, which indicates that, among the economical parameters of the analysis, the most influential is the expenditure with biomass acquisition. This seems logical given that the whole business model depends on the FFB in order to operate. Another parameter that had a huge role in the NPV calculation was the high Brazilian taxation rates. For the baseline scenario, the IRPJ/CSLL class could change the NPV by 195% for modality 1 and 112% for modality 2. However, the parameter that has the strongest influence in all scenarios is the market price of biodiesel. As it is the only biofuel product in the baseline scenario, its influence is huge for this case and still high for the other cases. Fig. 6 presents the most influential parameters for the NPV calculation in the biorefineries and how extensive the respective influences are."
13,Life cycle Assessment,"5.4 Life cycle Assessment The boundaries of the system were established as palm cultivation to biofuels and power production, cradle-to-gate. The calculation basis is for 1 t of FFB and exergy allocation, and the life cycle analysis is carried out using the inventories. The LCI for FFB cultivation, transportation, extraction unit, cogeneration system, R&T plant, second-generation ethanol plant, and HEFA plant are presented in Supplementary Material E. For the ATJ plant, as the reaction does not produce emissions in the air [22], only the mass and energy balances already presented were considered as inventory. The carried life cycle analysis takes its results from Global Warming Potential category presented in Table 8, in which the results are presented in kg CO2eq /t FFB. In Supplementary Material F, the figures present the results of the environmental impacts of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. In (a), the midpoint impact distribution among the biofuels produced is presented while (b) shows the endpoint results for the biofuels. The baseline scenario does not present this division of impacts because there is only one biofuel produced in this case: biodiesel. For the midpoint impacts of Scenario 1, the only intermediate impact that has a more significant effect on transesterification than for the HEFA technology is the carcinogens. Ozone layer depletion and non-renewable energy have nearly the same impact for both biodiesel and BJF. In the endpoint scenario, the production of renewable jet fuel was not environmentally dominant in the criteria of resources because of the methanol use in transesterification for Scenario 1. Such behavior does not occur in Scenario 2, where transesterification takes place through the ethylic route. In Scenario 2, the LCA results show that the second-generation ethanol plant and the ATJ plant both have a higher environmental load than transesterification since in this scenario transesterification is not carried along with fossil resources when the ATJ uses hydrogen and the ethanol plant counts with the fermentation process which is known for having CO2 as a co-product. In terms of the global warming impact, the biodiesel production showed only 20% of the impact designated by the biorefinery in this scenario, while the production of BJF accounted for 45%. However, the highest indicators for the ATJ technology compared to the HEFA route may be explained by a domino effect triggered by the production of ethanol, which has a considerable environmental load due to low reaction conversion yield and high energy demand and CO2 emission. The focus of the environmental evaluation of the refineries is on climate change effects. The global warming potential of the products was measured, and the results were divided by the stage to point out which stage must receive special attention in order to reduce emissions. It is noted that, for biodiesel production, the stage with the most significant impact is palm cultivation. Herbicides and pesticides are used in the field, as well as heavy machinery fueled by fossil fuels. Therefore, the largest share of equivalent CO2 emissions comes from the cultivation. This could be solved by adopting the use of the produced biodiesel in the machinery as the exploitation of cultivation techniques that ideally demand no pesticide or herbicide. The difference in emissions between the baseline scenario and Scenario 1 resides in cogeneration given that in Scenario 1 more biomass is consumed and more energy is demanded. Consequently, there is more greenhouse gas emissions for which to account and considerably more environmental load associated with this stage. The difference between Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 lies in the R&T plant because the ethylic route is explored in Scenario 2, thus more alcohol is consumed compared to the methanol route. Likewise, more energy was demanded from cogeneration, which designated a domino effect in environmental terms. For the comparison of results found in the present work with different reports from the literature, the values presented in the Table 8 were converted into a different basis from kg CO2eq/t FFB to kg CO2 per ton of each produced fuel. This conversion is carried out by means of mass balances from inventories, which reports that for 1 kg of biodiesel, 2.83 kg of FFB are consumed, for 1 kg of BJF from HEFA route, 5.73 kg of FFB are necessary, and for 1 kg of BJF from ATJ, the demand is 11.4 kg of FFB. The emissions reported for palm oil biodiesel production in the studies Kermani et al. [61] and Valderrama [70] are compared in Fig. 7 with those reported in this work and for conventional fossil diesel reported by Liu et al. [71]. For biodiesel in the present study, there is no notable statistical difference. Once the adopted parameters have followed a coherent path for Scenario 2, the global warming impact is slightly higher due to the already explained domino effect that the higher consumption of ethanol and energy designates. Nevertheless, it still made them better for the environment than the other reports on the use of palm oil to produce biodiesel and it validates itself as a renewable alternative by presenting considerable environmental gain when compared to its fossil similar. When evaluating the routes for BJF production in view of the CO2 emissions, the value for the ATJ biorefinery is more environmentally offensive than the HEFA biorefinery. These numbers reflects that the ATJ plant by itself has a lower impact than the HEFA plant. However, the Ethanol plant has a heavy environmental burden that comes from the POM stage – in which extracting the EFB more environmental load is associated with extracting the same amount of palm oil – and expands in the ethanol production consuming even more resources. The BJF production was compared to results reported by different studies including Vásquez et al. [17], for a HEFA-produced BJF from palm oil; Klein et al. [20] also reported palm oil BJF produced via HEFA and sugarcane BJF produced by the ATJ process. The authors of that work additionally reported a comparative parameter for the production of Fossil Jet Fuel with a global warming potential of 3586.44 kg CO2 eq/t, while Wong et al. [72] calculated the emissions associated with the life cycle of fossil Jet A-1 fuel. The HEFA process for the biorefinery in Scenario 1 indicated a better value than the one found by Klein et al. [33], but worse than that found by Vásquez et al. [17]. The difference regarding the work of Vásquez et al. might reside in the fact that the work was considered the capture of carbon associated with the palm oil cultivation, differently from the present work. For the ATJ route in Scenario 2, the environmental effect was better than the results reported by Klein et al. [33] for this process, (Fig. 8 ), where the authors called the environmental outcome poor and justified by the low yield of conversion that the technology is capable of providing, but the difference in the LCA approach for this study resides in the different allocation method chosen. There the environmental load was allocated by economic factors and here by product exergy, which can result in statistical difference as shown by Valderrama [70]."
14,Conclusions,"This work studied and compared different routes for BJF production in a biorefinery with current biodiesel production. The largest plant did not produce the highest quantity of biofuel and surplus electricity but rather indicated the largest irreversibility amount, which indicates that only the joining of different technologies in a biorefinery can be unfavorable if there is no synergy. The thermoeconomic cost showed that the ATJ plant demanded a considerable amount more resources to produce 1 MW of BJF than the HEFA plant. This also had monetary effects since the allocated monetary costs were much smaller for the HEFA fuels than the ATJ fuels. This indicates that it is currently better to explore the vegetable oil route for producing renewable aircraft fuels. The results of exergoeconomic evaluation can relate in this sense with the immaturity of the ATJ route, which yields low conversion rates and have high energy consumption; Considering the monetary cost from the exergoeconomic analysis as production costs and comparing with work done by different authors, the cost allocated by the HEFA process were the lowest found, like from ATJ was the largest among all reports; Biodiesel production presented different behaviors regarding exergy and monetary costs. The exergy costs indicate that the ethylic route of Scenario 2 should not be prioritized because it had a higher cost. However, from the perspective of monetary costs, the second-generation ethanol produced in this scenario contributed to lowering the cost of biodiesel since there are no expenses related to external resources like methanol. In addition, the biodiesel production showed better environmental performance than other studies with palm oil for the transesterification. In light of that, the production of ethanol and biodiesel showed itself to be synergetic. The economic analysis showed that the expenses with the cogeneration system and the HEFA plant compromise the investment attractiveness. Biodiesel, glycerol and electricity that had production costs under the market margin did not make the economic viable systems due to the small profit margin that these products provided. Meanwhile, the high investment to implement the bio-jet fuel plants end up causing an increase in the production costs of the biofuels, which made it non-competitive with fossil fuels and designated a great loss, which is illustrated by the negative values of NPV. Regarding cogeneration, the statement is held by results of investment modality 2, which showed revenues rise and the NPV became positive when the investment to install and operate the cogeneration station was not considered. In addition, the carried sensitivity analysis indicated that the baseline scenario is very dependent on biodiesel production since it is the only biofuel obtained in the plant. When the market price for sales varied, the NPV oscillated more the 600%, which indicates a huge risk for investors. Therefore, it highlights the importance of multiproduct biorefineries in the economic performance of biofuels to reduce market risks and dependence. Moreover, this analysis showed that the high Brazilian taxes corroborate with the poor economic performance of the biorefineries, federal incentives and that tax reductions policies should be credited to the biofuel market in order to make these fuels competitive in the market and set them in the national matrix in order to achieve the goals of RenovaBio and met the Paris Agreement commitments. The LCA indicated that the production routes for BJF have a larger environmental load than the biodiesel production for all impact categories at the midpoint and endpoint level; But numbers in the same range of results were reported by other studies. Moreover, these presented a high range of environmental gain when compared to different references for fossil fuel, the avoided emissions for biodiesel in comparison to fossil diesel were 324.65 kgCO2eq/t; for bio-jet fuels the avoided emissions were 3281.36 and 3092.45 kg CO2eq/t, from HEFA and ATJ routes, respectively. Furthermore, there is room for improvement concerning the environmental performance of the bio-jet fuel production regarding both routes, and this shall be addressed in future work aiming at low-carbon economy and the decarbonization credits market, which can make these investments viable and these plants more sustainable. The great challenge that the production of renewable aviation fuels has been facing is being competitive against fossil fuels. To achieve such a milestone and make the biofuels permanently competitive, the carbon credits due to emissions avoided in the economic evaluation shall be considered and the processes should be studied at a detailed level in order to improve the conversion yield, reduce costs and decrease thermodynamic losses. However, it is preponderant to complain to governmental authorities regarding the sanction of incentive laws and tax relief in the biofuels industry in Brazil as it has been conducted in US and Europe. The present work draws the line in showing the irreversibility and costs. Considering that both have room to improve, a future work should follow with optimization concepts and advanced exergy evaluation to exploit the great potential of these renewable fuels demonstrated herein."
