0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is the most promising renewable energy resource due to its abundance on the earth and high energy density compared with fossil fuels. Therefore, hydrogen is a suitable, cost-efficient, and eco-friendly alternative for traditional energy sources [1,2]. However, pure hydrogen does not form naturally on the earth and can be extracted from different compounds using various methods. In addition, the storage of the produced hydrogen is the main barrier for the application of hydrogen as a source of energy. The material based technique, which is a suitable method for hydrogen storage, consists of the chemical and physical interactions of decomposed hydrogen with porous compounds [3]. Recently, the application of various solid compounds with good porosity such as metals, metal oxides, carbon based compounds, etc., has been considered for storing hydrogen by the electrochemical method [3–6]. In this technique, hydrogen atom is stored on the surface of the decorated electrode with porous compounds at low temperatures and pressures [7]. The evaluation of electrochemical hydrogen storage is usually performed using a three electrode setup consisting of a reference electrode (RE), working electrode (WE), and counter electrode (CE). Additionally, an electrolyte solution is employed as hydrogen resource [8]. CV, Galvanostatic method, and electronic impedance spectroscopy are techniques for studying electrochemical hydrogen storage [7]. CV is a simple and common technique for evaluating the electrochemical properties of compounds using redox reactions [8]. Bentonite is one of the most important industrially clays owing to its non-toxicity, high surface area, eco-friendly nature, cost-efficiency, high thermal stability, and high availability features [9,10]. Bentonite is mainly composed of montmorillonite, which is a member of the smectite family [11]. The structure of bentonite is based on three layers including two tetrahedral silica layers and one alumina octahedral layer and is generally denoted by the formula of Rx(H2O)4[(Al2-x,Mgx)[(Si,Al)4O10](OH)2], where R is an exchangeable cations [12]. This lamellar structure has exchangeable cations such as Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Al3+ [10,13]. Bentonite has a high adsorption ability due to the presence of empty sites within its layers as well as an external surface [14]. Hence, bentonite, a porous mineral, can be used as a substrate for hydrogen storage. Furthermore, bentonite has been known as a suitable matrix for loading NPs [12,15,16]. Recently, nanosized compounds have been widely considered because of their specific features and improved surface properties [17–19]. The application of porous substrates with metal NPs is one of the most attractive strategy to enhance hydrogen production [20–22]. Metal NPs with electrical conductivity and high surface area are useful in electrochemical fields [23]. In addition, metal NPs can participate as separators in the hydrogen spillover mechanism [24]. In brief, spillover mechanism consists of the following three processes can cause the improvement of atomic hydrogen adsorption, as represented in Fig. 1 [25]: 1. Chemical decomposition of hydrogen molecules on the metallic NPs and formation of atomic hydrogen. 2. Migration of atomic hydrogen from metallic NPs to the adjacent adsorption surface 3. Propagation of atomic hydrogen along the acceptor surface. Metal-organic framework (MOF), carbon based structures, zeolites, mesoporous silica, and other porous compounds have been introduced as sorbents in the hydrogen spillover mechanism [26]. Mesoporous silica compounds are suitable candidates for loading metallic NPs due to their high surface area, large pore size and lamellar structure [27]. Hence, bentonite, a mesoporous silica with aluminosilicate layers, can act as an acceptor substrate in the hydrogen spillover mechanism. Pd NPs with prominent physicochemical features such as chemical stability, thermal stability, cost-efficiency, and high catalytic activity are one of the most efficient noble metal NPs employed for hydrogen storage [5,28,29]. Since the applications of Pd NPs strongly depend on their size, the investigation of synthetic approaches for prepare Pd NPs with controlled size are one of the most important research fields [30]. In general, different methods for the synthesis of NPs include physical, chemical, and biological methods [31]. The preparation of NPs through chemical methods yields toxic by-products and environmental pollution. Laser ablation in liquid (LAL) as an efficient physical method can be applied to prepare NPs with specified morphology and high purity from metals, metal oxides, ceramics, alloys, etc. [18]. In comparison with other synthetic methods, LAL is a faster, cleaner, and easier pathway. LAL process can be performed in different liquid media such as alcohol, acetone, and distilled water. It is worth mentioning that some aqueous solutions of surfactants can be added to the liquid media for controlling the size of NPs [32]. In summary, Pd NPs have been loaded onto the bentonite substrate via facile physical mixing and the possibility of their hydrogen production and storage have been investigated. LAL was applied as a clean method to prepare Pd NPs with size of 20–27 nm. The Pd NPs were then dispersed over the bentonite surface by stirring method. The CV analysis was employed to determination of hydrogen storage capacity, suggesting that hydrogen charge is 37 C/g."
1,Experimental,
2,Instruments and reagents,"2.1 Instruments and reagents Bentonite was provided from the Vartoon area (Isfahan province, Iran). Powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD, Philips powder diffractometer type PW 1373 goniometer) patterns were used for the structural determination of bentonite and the fabricated nanocomposite. The functional groups of the nanocomposites were determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Thermo Nicolet). The specific surface area and pore size of the nanocomposite were analyzed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET, DELSORP-mini II) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) assays, respectively. The lattice fringes of NPs and morphology of nanocomposite were determined by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL 2100) and scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEM-2100F JEOL) images, respectively. Additionally, elemental mapping and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed to analyze the elements of the synthesized nanocomposite. Electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity was evaluated using the resultant CV curve using an Autolab device (PSTAT204)."
3,Preparation of bentonite/Pd nanocomposite,"2.2 Preparation of bentonite/Pd nanocomposite Pd NPs were prepared in deionized water using laser ablation in four different reaction times of 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, as previously reported [33]. Pd (99.9%) target was cleaned in deionized water by ultrasonic irradiation for 15 min. Afterwards, the target was fixed in a glass vessel containing 5 mL of deionized water. A fiber laser (RFLP30Q) beam (λ = 1064 nm, maximum power of 30 W, and frequency of 20 Hz) was focused on the Pd target square area. The color of deionized water changed to black over time, which demonstrated the synthesis of Pd NPs. To prevent the accumulation of Pd NPs and reduce the laser energy, laser radiation was stopped every 5 min, Pd colloid was collected in another glass vessel, and laser radiation was then repeated in fresh deionized water. 0.05 g of commercial bentonite was dispersed in deionized water (20 mL) under sonication for 30 min, followed by the addition of Pd colloid. To obtain a uniform mixture of Pd NPs and bentonite, the above suspension was stirred for 24 h at room temperature, poured into the Petri dishes and dried at room temperature. These steps were repeated for all fabricated colloidal Pd NPs and the synthesized nanocomposites were noted as B/Pd15, B/Pd30, B/Pd45, and B/Pd60."
4,Preparation of electrodes,"2.3 Preparation of electrodes The drop-casting method was used to prepare bentonite and bentonite/Pdx (x is laser ablation time) electrodes. At first, stainless steel mesh electrodes with surface area of 0.36 cm2 (200 mesh) were washed with acetone and deionized water, respectively. Afterwards, approximately 0.001 g of bentonite or bentonite/Pdx nanocomposites was dispersed in deionized water (5 mL) for the synthesis of a homogenous suspension, which was then dropped onto the stainless steel mesh electrodes. Finally, the deposited electrodes were dried at room temperature for 24 h. It is worth mentioning that the mass of the electrodes was measured before and after drop-casting to determine the weight of the deposited bentonite and nanocomposites. The synthesis processes for the nanocomposites and electrode are displayed in Fig. 2 ."
5,Electrochemical investigation,"CV technique is a fast, facile, and low cost tool to characterize the electrochemical process and chemical reaction kinetics. Hence, the electrochemical hydrogen storage was measured in 1.0 M KOH solution at room temperature by the CV technique. A standard three electrode system consisting of Pt plate (CE, 0.64 cm2), Ag/AgCl (RE) and WE was applied to record the CV curves. To find the best electrode with the maximum hydrogen storage capacity, CV analysis was performed in a potential window of −1.5-0.5 V at the scan rate of 0.1 V/s. The hydrogen storage value of the best electrode was then determined by changing the potential window to −1.5-0 V at the scan rate of 0.1 V/s. The hydrogen adsorption/desorption mechanism at the WE surface can be understood through three chemical reactions including Volmer, Tafel, and Heyrovsky reactions. Water dissociation or water reduction occurs by applying potential. The atomic hydrogen is adsorbed onto the WE due to electrical polarization and then diffuses into the electrode material (Habs) [7,34,35]. (1) H2O + B + e− ⇄ BHads + OH− (Volmer reaction) (2) BHads ⇄ BHabs B is the material on the WE. Recombination of adsorbed hydrogen atoms leads to gaseous hydrogen formation described by the Tafel reaction. (3) 2BHads ⇄ H2 (g) + 2B (Tafel reaction) Hydrogen molecules may also be formed by dissociation of water molecules. (4) BHads + H2O + e− ⇄ B + ½ H2 (g) + OH− (Heyrovsky reaction) It is worth mentioning that hydrogen storage is carried out by the Volmer-Tafel reaction or Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction. Additionally, these reactions are repeatable since water is the final product."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"4.1 Characterization XRD patterns were utilized to determine the structure of bentonite and the as-synthesized nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the absorption peaks at 2θ = 20, 22.3, 54.5, 62.1, 73.2, and 76.3° are corresponded to montmorillonite as the main structure of bentonite. Additionally, the peaks located at 28.7 and 36.3° correspond to illite and quartz impurities, respectively [9,36]. The intensity of montmorillonite and quartz peaks decreased by the addition of Pd NPs. As depicted in Fig. 3b, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 40.3, 46.9, 68.4, and 82.4° (JCPDS 46–1043) confirm the presence of Pd in B/Pd30 nanocomposite. The grain size of Pd NPs can be calculated using the Scherrer's equation [37]: (5) D = 0.9 λ β cos θ where λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.154 nm) and β and θ are the full width of half maximum intensity (FWHM) in the radian and the Bragg diffraction peak, respectively. The crystallite size was calculated for two sharp peaks located at 2θ = 40.3° and 46.9° and the average crystallite size was obtained as 39 nm. Fig. 3c illustrates the FT-IR spectra of B/Pd30 and bentonite. The vibration bands are shown in Fig. 3c [38,39]. The stretching vibrations of OH groups give rise to the absorption band at 3624 cm−1. The absorbed peaks at 1082 and 792 cm−1 correspond to quartz vibration, which has also been confirmed by the XRD pattern [40]. The two peaks at 461 and 514 cm−1 are due to the vibration of Si–O–Al and Si–O–Si bonds, respectively [41]. The band located at approximately 1036 cm−1 is attributed to the scattering of Si–O, which is indicative of montmorillonite. The band at 915 cm−1 is ascribed to Al–OH–Al or Al–Al–OH [39]. The vibration of H–O–H bond is responsible for the peak at 1640 cm−1 [42]. The three peaks at 624, 1721, and 1460 cm−1 are due to Si–O–Al, CO, and C–H, respectively [38,43]. The peak intensities changed and a small shift was observed in the peaks of the B/Pd30 spectrum in comparison to pure bentonite by adding Pd NPs. This can be due to the physical interaction between Pd NPs and bentonite substrate. BET and BJH analyses were performed to measure the surface area and determine the pore size distribution, as presented in Fig. 4 . The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of both pure bentonite (according to our previously reported [44]) and B/Pd30 nanocomposite, show type IV. These isotherms indicate hysteresis loops of H3, which signifies a mesoporous structure [45,46]. In addition, the narrow isotherms of the samples showed that their structure consists of parallel layers [47]. The pore distribution of both bentonite and B/Pd30 is 1.2–95.2 nm. However, the maximum pore diameters of bentonite and B/Pd30 were approximately 2.4 nm and 1.8 nm, respectively. The textural parameters of bentonite and B/Pd30 have been listed in Table 1 . A slight reduction is observed in the specific surface area of B/Pd30 compared with bentonite substrate. This is presumably due to the agglomeration of Pd NPs on bentonite and the size of Pd NPs. However, the mean pore diameter has been enhanced by adding Pd NPs. HRTEM assay was applied to determine the shape and lattice fringe (d-spacing) of Pd NPs. Spherically shaped Pd NPs (black area) are accumulated on the bentonite surface (gray area) (Fig. 5 a). As illustrated in Fig. 5b, d-spacing is found to be 0.23 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of the Pd NPs. Furthermore, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern was utilized to identify the crystal structure of the B/Pd30 nanocomposite. As observed in Fig. 5c, the planes of (111), (200), (220), and (311) are attributed to the Pd face centered cubic (FCC) unit cell (JCPDS 46–1043), which is in good agreement with the XRD pattern. To morphologically investigate B/Pd30 nanocomposite, FESEM analysis was performed and the corresponding images are presented in Fig. 5(d–f). It is clear that B/Pd30 nanocomposite has a flake-like structure. Fig. 5e and f are confirmed the accumulation of spherically shaped Pd NPs on bentonite. The diameter of Pd NPs is in the range of 20–27 nm. The elements of B/Pd30 nanocomposite were evaluated using EDS and elemental mapping analysis, which are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The peaks observed in the EDS spectrum of B/Pd30 nanocomposite are characteristic of C, O, Si, Mg, Na, Al, and Pd elements. In addition, the distribution of these elements is visible in the mapping images (Fig. 6b)."
8,Hydrogen storage investigation,"4.2 Hydrogen storage investigation The electrochemical hydrogen storage was investigated in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at room temperature. Before measuring the amount of stored hydrogen, the prepared electrodes were activated during 20 cycles in the potential window of −1.5-0.5 V. The cyclic voltammograms of the activation curves of the electrodes are shown in Fig. 7 . As it can be observed, faradic peaks, A and B, located at ∼ −1.06 V and ∼ −0.68 V, are attributed to the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen ions, respectively. During cathodic polarization, hydrogen atoms are released through water decomposition and the reduction peak (A, cathodic peak) appears in the cathodic direction, indicating hydrogen adsorption onto the electrodes. In the anodic direction, the desorption of adsorbed hydrogen is performed due to the anodic polarization, which results in the appearance of the oxidation peak (B, anodic peak) at ∼ −0.68 V. In addition, the second oxidation peak (C) at ∼ −0.20 V appears due to the oxidation of nanostructured compounds and the beginning of the oxidation process. For the sake of comparison, the reduction and oxidation peak currents (IA and IB) of the electrodes after 20 cycles are listed in Table 2 . The electrode decorated with bentonite exhibited low current owing to its great surface area. The current of B was enhanced by loading Pd NPs even in low Pd content. It is worth mentioning that the difference between the oxidation peak currents of B/Pd30 and B/Pd60 is around 1.27 A/g. Thus, B/Pd30 was selected as the best electrode due to its high current and cost-efficiency. Therefore, Pd NPs can improve hydrogen adsorption due to their prominent electrical conductivity and participation in the hydrogen spillover mechanism. Afterwards, the optimum activation cycle of the best electrode (B/Pd30) was obtained by more CV scans. The cyclic voltammograms of the optimization process are depicted in Fig. 8 a. The currents of A and B peaks continually increased over time from the 1st to the 197th cycle, which is because of the formation of active sites [42,43], and the reduction of current was then observed from the 198th to the 220th cycle (Fig. 8b). This decline probably takes place due to the oxidation or damage of the B/Pd30 electrode [48]. According to previous reports [34,44], the amount of the stored hydrogen can be calculated from the integration of oxidation peak. The blue and white areas in Fig. 8c are attributed to the double layer and hydrogen storage capacity of the B/Pd30 electrode, respectively. The integration of anodic peak is: (6) Q H = 1 ϑ ∫ − 0.86 − 0.30 ( I − I d l ) d E where ϑ is the scan rate, I, Idl and dE are currents of anodic peak, double layer charging, and the charge of potential, respectively [49]. Hence, the hydrogen charge of the activated B/Pd30 electrode was calculated and plotted as a function of cycle number. As observed in Fig. 8d, the highest hydrogen capacity of B/Pd30 was obtained after 197 cycles. Afterwards, the optimization was stopped and hydrogen adsorption/desorption was studied by changing the potential window to −1.5-0 V. Fig. 9 a shows the recorded hydrogen adsorption/desorption of the B/Pd30 electrode in the potential window of −1.5-0 eV at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s. The current of B changes as a function of cycle number, as represented in Fig. 9b. During the first five cycles, the current of B reduced considerably from 81.95 A/g to 17.44 A/g due to oxidation of the electrode. By increasing the cycle number, the current slightly reduced, and then became constant at ∼6 A/g after 200 cycles. Accordingly, the activation process of the electrode surface can be effective for increasing the hydrogen storage capacity. Fig. 9c illustrates the hydrogen charge of the B/Pd30 electrode in the potential window of −1.5-0 V, calculated using Eq. (6). The hydrogen charge steadily reduced from ∼283 C/g to ∼69 C/g over the first five cycles due to the electrode surface oxidation and then became fixed at ∼37 C/g. The mechanism of the hydrogen adsorption/desorption on the B/Pd30 electrode can be proposed as follows [50]: In the first step, water molecules are decomposed by applying a potential (Volmer reaction, Eq. (7)), and the hydrogen atoms (Hads) are adsorbed on the electrode surface. (7) B/Pd30 + xH2O + xe− ⇄ B/Pd30-xHads + xOH− The adsorbed hydrogen atoms then form hydrogen gas during Tafel reaction (8) or Heyrovsky reaction (9). (8) 2B/Pd30-xHads ⇄ H2 (g) + B/Pd30 (9) B/Pd30-xHads + H2O + e− ⇄ B/Pd30 + H2 (g) + OH− This evolution of hydrogen can be physically observed as bubbles in the vicinity of the WE surface. The strong oxidation peak appears in the anodic direction by Eq. (10). This reaction is reversible because the water molecule is the by-product. (10) B/Pd30-xHads + xOH− ⇄ B/Pd30+ xH2O + xe− FESEM analysis was performed to study the surface changes of B/Pd30 electrode after CV tests (Fig. 10 ). The results show that the surface of the pure mesh electrode was successfully decorated with B/Pd30 nanocomposite (Fig. 10a) and the good stability of the nanocomposite on the electrode was confirmed after CV tests. The comparison of Fig. 10b and e indicates that the lamellar structure of B/Pd30 was slightly smoothed, which can affect the hydrogen storage capacity. In addition, all white dots in Fig. 10c and f relate to Pd NPs that some of them have been characterized, indicating the presence of the Pd NPs using BSE (backscattered electrons) detector before and after CV analysis. The comparison of the hydrogen evolution of the reported Pd based nanocomposites with that by the as-prepared nanocomposite is shown in Table 3 ."
9,Conclusion,"LAL method, a clean and straightforward approach, was used to synthesize Pd NPs, which were then loaded on the bentonite substrate by physical mixing. The characterization results indicated the dispersion of Pd NPs on the bentonite. The hydrogen adsorption/desorption capability of the nanocomposite electrode was evaluated using the CV technique at room temperature in an alkaline medium. The cyclic voltammogram curves showed that the deposited electrode with B/Pd30 nanocomposite displayed excellent electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity and great stability after 200 cycles. The amount of the stored hydrogen was approximately 37 C/g. Hence, the application of catalysts containing metallic NPs such as Pd NPs can be a practical and low cost approach for enhancing hydrogen storage. Given that the as-prepared nanocomposite possesses a high surface area of 44 m2/g (Table 1), it can be used as a catalyst for the removal of pollutants. In addition, these nanocomposites can be used as promising catalysts for the preparation of hydrogen in fuel cells. The combination of bentonite with other NPs such as Fe3O4, Ag, TiO2, ZnO, and ZrO2 for H2 production through the electrochemical and photocatalytic process can be investigated in the future works."
