0,Introduction,"Alcohol abuse is a major health issue with ever-rising morbidity and mortality worldwide. According to the data from the World Health Organization (WHO), over 2.3 billion individuals consume alcoholic products on a regular basis, among which approximately 75 million suffer from various forms of alcoholic disorders [1]. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) usually denotes a maladaptive heavy drinking pattern characterized by compulsive alcohol consumption and loss of control over ethanol usage [2,3]. AUD is rooted from a complex interaction of genetic factors and a cadre of environmental factors, including socioeconomic, cultural and religious impact, gender, acute and chronic stress, as well as parental alcohol problems [1,4–6]. Poor management for AUD is commonly seen as evidenced by a large-scale study from 6 European countries, with merely 22.3% of AUD patients receiving adequate interventions [7]. Other than AUD, long-term alcohol consumption contributes to a wide range of health issues including alcoholic liver disease (ALD), gastrointestinal injury, pancreatitis, cancers, metabolic anomalies, cardiovascular and psychiatry disorders [8–11] (Fig. 1 ). Cardiovascular system is the second most affected organ system from alcoholic toxicity next to the hepatic-gastrointestinal system. Although ample experimental and clinical studies have indicated that light to moderate alcohol intake may offer beneficial outcomes on cardiovascular health [12–14], chronic heavy alcohol or binge drinking is deemed an independent risk factor for cardiovascular anomalies, including stroke, hypertension, myocardial hypertrophy, and arrhythmias [15–18]. Meanwhile, adolescent binge alcohol intake may impede normal cardiac growth and reorient the heart towards pathological remodeling [19]. In addition, nearly 1/3 of alcoholics display some forms of cardiac structural and functional abnormalities reminiscent of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy known as alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) [20–23]. Clinical and experimental evidence has defined characteristic changes in ACM including ventricular dilation, cardiac hypertrophy, myofibrillar disruption, interstitial fibrosis, and compromised myocardial contractility [22,24,25]. According to the death registries from 91 countries, 25,997 individuals died of ACM in 2015, with a mortality rate of 4.9 per 1,000,000 adults [26]. Given the complexity of alcohol on organ function, the precise correlation between alcohol intake and severity of alcoholic complications remains complicated. Not all individuals with high levels of alcohol intake eventually provoke ACM, and susceptibility of alcoholic complications exhibits vast individual variations. Numerous studies have observed an essential role for genetic polymorphism in the etiology of AUD and ACM [27–29]. More emerging evidence has also depicted an expanding spectrum of alcohol-induced reorganization of gene expression through epigenetic modulation, en route to the etiology of AUD and ACM [30–33]. Epigenetics, first coined in 1942 by Waddington, is defined as variations in gene expression as well as cellular and physiological phenotypes in the absence of altered DNA encoding sequence [34,35]. Epigenetic modulation is deemed a springboard between genome and environmental exposures. Alcohol consumption may alter epigenetic profile, in a manner reminiscent of common environmental cues such as air pollution [32,36]. Here this review aims to discuss the role of epigenetics in AUD and alcohol-induced cardiovascular complications (ACM). We will also elaborate on the available therapeutic drugs targeting epigenetics for management of AUD."
1,Epigenetics: an overview,"Epigenetics denotes inheritable machineries impacting gene expression without altering genetic sequence. Epigenetic modifications are responsive to a range of environmental stimuli including alcohol exposure [32]. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate chromatin remodeling, making it more readily accessible for the binding of transcription factors, co-repressors or co-activators, thereby regulating gene expression [37]. Here we will focus on three key epigenetic modification modalities, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-based mechanisms."
2,DNA methylation,"2.1 DNA methylation DNA methylation occurs via attaching methyl groups donated by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) onto cytosines primarily in cytosine-paired-with-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides, resulting in formation of 5-methyl cytosine (5mC) to silence gene transcription [38]. Methylation reaction is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b [39]. DNA methylation is removed by hydroxylation of 5mC into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) [40], an intermediate of DNA demethylation to offset transcriptional inhibition of 5mC [41]. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase enzymes have been shown to catalyze the transformation of 5mC to 5hmC [36]."
3,Histone modifications,"2.2 Histone modifications Histone modifications primarily occur in N-terminal tails of histones, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation [32]. These histone modifications participate in the activation or repression of gene transcription through a shift between an open (euchromatin) and a compact (heterochromatin) chromatin frame [42]. Histone acetylation, associated with enhanced gene expression, primarily takes place at the lysine (K) residues on histones H3 and H4 [43]. Two groups of essential enzymes have been demonstrated to catalyze acetylation/deacetylation including histone acetyltransferases (HATs) which add acetyl groups, and histone deacetylases (HDACs) which remove such modifications. HATs and HDACs play opposite roles to increase and decrease transcription, respectively [44]. Histone methylation, on the other hands, is catalyzed by histone methyltransferases (HMTs), to activate or inhibit gene transcription depending on the site of methylated residues and number of methyl groups [45,46]."
4,RNA-based mechanisms,"2.3 RNA-based mechanisms NcRNAs regulate the transcriptional potential without altering genetic sequences [47]. Ample studies have denoted a pivotal role for ncRNAs in the regulation of gene expression at the levels of both transcription and translation [48]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the best-examined ncRNAs in the cardiovascular system, refer to short single-stranded RNAs profoundly repressing transcription of mRNAs through binding to 3′-untranslated region of mRNA [49,50]. Notably, miRNAs are highly abundant in brain and participate in cellular adaptations evoked by a number of abused substances including alcohol [51,52]."
5,Ethanol metabolism and epigenetic alterations,"In the oxidative metabolism of alcohol, ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the liver. Acetaldehyde is then converted to acetate in the mitochondria by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) [53,54]. The latter oxidative reaction converts NAD+ to NADH, leading to an enriched reductive environment. Acetaldehyde may also be produced by peroxisome catalase and cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYP2E1, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4) in microsomes, particularly following chronic alcohol consumption [13]. The ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde was reported to suppress DNMT1 activity, leading to DNA hypomethylation [55]. Oxidative ethanol metabolism is involved in epigenetic regulation through changes in NADH/NAD+ ratio and ROS levels [32]. Levels of main epigenetic enzymes (DNMTs, HATs, HDACs, HMTs, and demethylases) are regulated by metabolic substrates such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), NAD+, adenine triphosphate, and acetyl-CoA [56]. In addition to the direct effect of alcohol and its metabolites on epigenetic modifications, alcohol may influence DNA methylation indirectly by interfering with methionine metabolism and SAM synthesis. In particular, alcohol exposure may inhibit methionine synthase which catalyzes the transformation of homocysteine to methionine, resulting in compromised SAM synthesis and elevated levels of homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) [57] (Fig. 2 ). Previous studies have demonstrated a close link between homocysteine levels and DNA methylation [58]. SAH has been shown to inhibit DNMTs thereby prompting a global DNA hypomethylation [59]. Ethanol intake leads to ROS production through CYP2E1 and NADH oxidation, with more ROS generated from alcohol-induced mitochondrial injury [60]. Under oxidative insult, homocysteine is transformed to glutathione, resulting in decreased SAM level and thus hypomethylation of DNA and histone [61]. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of DNMTs in alcohol exposure [62–64]. Garro and coworkers reported that fetal alcohol exposure led to an overt reduction in DNMT1 activity [65]. In addition, levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b were overtly decreased in AUD [55]. Examination of global DNA methylation following alcohol challenge also noted an overt drop in DNMT expression and methylation in brain tissues [65,66]. However, chronic alcohol exposure, in contrary to acute insults, increased DNMT1 level in nucleus accumbens to favor global DNA hypermethylation in the brain [67]. Similarly, alcohol-dependent rats evoked DNMT1 expression and global DNA methylation following prolonged abstinence, the effect of which was related to decreased expression of synaptic genes in medial prefrontal cortex neurons [68]. Overall, acute alcohol exposure seems to suppress DNMT to favor DNA hypomethylation and transcriptional activation of chromatin in alcoholics, while chronic exposure of alcohol induces neuroadaptation, restoration and even higher levels of DNA methylation [69]. Following alcohol withdrawal, elevated levels of DNMT and HMT evoke DNA hypermethylation and chromatin condensation."
6,Epigenetics and AUD,
7,Current understandings for pathogenesis of AUD,"4.1 Current understandings for pathogenesis of AUD AUD is characterized by loss of control over alcohol usage, accompanied by alterations in essential neuronal circuits and brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, midbrain and ventral tegmental area. Drinking behavior is controlled by positive and negative reinforcement mechanisms. Neurotransmitters are involved in development of AUD. The positive reinforcing effects are mainly provoked by dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and opioid peptides, while negative reinforcement may involve elevated glutamatergic function and corticotropin-releasing factor as well as decreased GABA transmission [70]. In addition, molecular signaling cascades are also involved in AUD development, such as dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Several essential molecules have been identified in the etiology of AUD, including neurotrophins, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and NMDA receptor 2B (NR2B) [71,72]."
8,DNA methylation in AUD,"4.2 DNA methylation in AUD Emerging evidence has denoted disparate DNA methylation responses (including hyper- and hypomethylation) on various CpG sites, genes, and promoters in alcoholics [73]. Table 1 provides an overview of alcohol-induced DNA methylation responses in brains and blood samples from human subjects and animal models. 4.2.1 Global DNA methylation alterations in AUD Several studies have conducted the genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in postmortem brains or blood from alcoholics. Human alcoholics exhibited a global DNA hypomethylation with decreased DNMT1 in the amygdala and frontal cortex [62]. In a whole-genome methylation study, a total of 1812 differentially methylated CpGs were identified in the prefrontal cortex of human alcoholics, among which 66.3% were hypermethylated [74]. Likewise, chronic alcohol exposure evoked global hypermethylation in the blood from alcoholics [55,75]. Discrepancies in DNA methylation may be related to targeted genomic locations of CpG sites and difference in methodology. Moreover, adolescent binge alcohol exposure resulted in global alterations in DNA methylation in rats, thereby impacting gene expression profile in the hypothalamus from alcohol-naive offspring [76,77]. Further studies suggested that these epigenetic alterations were linked with maladaptive sequelae on growth, pubertal development, and social interactions in offspring [78]. 4.2.2 DNA methylation alterations in specific gene targets for AUD 4.2.2.1 Neurotrophins Neurotrophins refer to a family of proteins promoting synaptic growth, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Alcohol exposure provokes changes in BDNF in brain regions associated with alcohol consumption, anxiety-like behaviors, and withdrawal [32]. Recent evidence has linked epigenetic modification of neurotrophins to AUD etiology [32]. In a study involving alcohol-dependent male patients, increased levels in DNA methylation on BDNF promoter were identified, which were reverted to normal levels 14 days following alcohol withdrawal [79]. Similarly, another human study also noted increased methylation in CpG island promoter of NGF gene in blood samples from alcoholics during withdrawal [80]. 4.2.2.2 HPA regulators Alcohol consumption results in impaired regulation of the HPA axis. Dysregulation of HPA axis often leads to loss of control over alcohol intake, compulsive motivation and consumption, and cognitive alterations, en route to the development of AUD [81]. Alcohol disrupts the HPA axis by influencing POMC and its derived peptides [82]. Gene-specific studies have reported changes in methylation in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in alcoholics with alcohol craving [83]. More evidence has also shown an association between promoter methylation pattern of POMC and pre−/post-exposure craving behavior in AUD [84]. In addition, hypomethylation of POMC and CRHR1 CpG islands was noted in the pituitary glands from rats exposed to early life stress and alcohol [85]. 4.2.2.3 Neurotransmitter systems Numerous studies have indicated involvement of key neurotransmitters in the development of AUD. Chronic alcohol exposure leads to adaptive alterations in several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, and norepinephrine. Genome-wide studies have demonstrated DNA methylation alterations in neurotransmission in AUD. Several studies examined alcoholics in comparison with their non-alcoholic siblings and identified altered methylation signatures in neurotransmitter genes [86], including glutamate-decarboxylase (GAD1) that regulates GABA production in alcoholics. In addition, altered methylation of GABA receptor (GABRP) suggested reduced alcohol-related GABA binding, while altered methylation of dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) was linked to alcohol tolerance in alcoholics [87]. Other studies have reported increased methylation for genes encoding arginine vasopressin (AVP) [88], dopamine transporter (DAT) [89], prodynorphin (PDYN) [90], and OPRM1 [91]. Among these genes, the OPRM1 gene encodes opioid receptor involved in the alcohol reward mechanism. 4.2.3 DNA methylation as a diagnostic tool for AUD Emerging evidence has suggested the utility of DNA methylation as a clinically effective diagnostic marker to monitor alcohol intake [92]. To date, available alcohol biomarkers including breathalyzers and hepatic transaminases, only detect short-term or high-dose alcohol exposure. [93]. DNA methylation markers are quite stable over a long timescale and several methylation signals were reported to prevail beyond half-lives of current alcohol biomarkers [94]. For example, Liu and colleagues employed 4 novel blood DNA methylation-based models using large population samples to identify alcohol exposure. Among which, the one containing the highest number of CpG sites performed the best to discriminate heavy drinkers from non-drinkers [92]. In this context, DNA methylation biomarker provides a novel sensitive approach to examine alcohol exposure for early diagnosis of AUD."
9,Histone modification in AUD,"4.3 Histone modification in AUD 4.3.1 Histone acetylation in AUD Up-to-date, ample evidence has depicted an essential role for histone modifications in AUD (Table 2 ). Both acute and chronic alcohol exposures trigger modulation of histone acetylation in amygdaloid circuitry, which ultimately contributes to the development of AUD [72,95]. In both humans and animals, chronic alcohol consumption upregulates HDAC levels in peripheral blood, whereas binge drinking downregulates HDAC expression [96]. Specifically, acute alcohol exposure induces global histone acetylation, while chronic exposure and withdrawal may lead to a reduction of histone acetylation [97]. These epigenetic alterations in acetylation usually occur at the site of H3K9 and participate in the regulation of specific addiction-related circuitry [98,99]. Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure decreased acetylated H3K9 levels of BDNF exon IV promoter, and BDNF expression in the hippocampus during adulthood in rats [100]. Notably, altered epigenetics is implicated in the regulation of gene expression and synaptic plasticity in AUD, particularly via cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and CREB binding protein (CBP). [101,102] CREB is an important neuronal transcription factor critically involved in epigenetic modifications in AUD [31,103]. CREB recognizes and binds consensus sequence of cAMP-responsive element (CRE) at the promoter region, evoking gene transcription. Phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 (p-CREB) (active form of CREB) recruits a complex including CBP with p300. The CBP/p300 complex is a crucial family of HAT, which acetylates histones and promotes transcription activation [104]. CREB-mediated signaling in the amygdala is of great significance to regulate ethanol-related behavior [105]. Acute and chronic alcohol exposure led to alterations in CREB/CBP/p300-related histone acetylation, which was involved in the regulation of genes involved in drinking behaviors, such as CBP, NPY and NR2B [71,72]. In medial and central nucleus of amygdala, acute alcohol exposure contributes to CREB activation, upregulated CBP, and inhibited HDAC activity [72,95]. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , acute alcohol exposure induces an increase in acetylated H3K9 and H4K8 in the amygdala, and exerts anxiolytic properties via upregulation of CREB target genes, including BDNF, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), NPY, and PDYN [106,107]. Contrary to acute exposure, chronic alcohol exposure leads to decreased expression of CREB and CBP in human alcoholics [62], as well as reduced NPY expression in amygdala in rats following withdrawal [72]. Post-exposure withdrawal leads to a reduction in acetylated H3K9, CBP expression, CREB activation and NPY. During alcohol withdrawal, the synaptic plasticity-associated genes BDNF and Arc were downregulated within amygdala, the effect of which was reversed by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) [108]. 4.3.2 Histone methylation in AUD Alcohol exposure also provokes histone methylation. Recent evidence has revealed a key role of histone methylation in the regulation of psychiatric disorders, including AUD. In the prefrontal cortex from adolescent rats subject to binge drinking, increased H3K4me2 was noted along with histone acetylation of transcription factors associated with learning and synaptic plasticity [109]. Acute alcohol exposure was found to also increase the level of H3K4me3 - an activating epigenetic mark near the transcription start sites in the cortex [99]. Notably, repressive histone methylation marks in the cortex are considered vital regulators for AUD. Binge-like alcohol exposure was shown to reduce the suppressive H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 for the NR2B gene in mouse cortical neurons [71]. Furthermore, chronic alcohol intake led to H3K4me3 in the cortex, which was associated with the transcription induction of several genes in human alcoholics [62]. All aforementioned evidence favors that alcohol exposure overtly alters histone modifications, and such epigenetic changes are highly associated with the complex pathogenesis of AUD."
10,Non-coding RNA in AUD,"4.4 Non-coding RNA in AUD Recent studies have revealed a significant difference in ncRNA profiles in AUD individuals, indicating a crucial role for ncRNAs in the regulation of AUD [110,111]. Table 3 demonstrates an overview of alcohol-induced alterations of miRNA profiles in human alcoholics and animal models of alcohol dependence. Several studies have displayed altered miRNA profile (mostly upregulation) in human postmortem brain in response to alcohol consumption. A transcriptome-wide survey identified 35 upregulated alcohol-responsive miRNAs in the prefrontal cortex from human alcoholics [51]. In another whole-genome study, miRNA profile was evaluated in brain frontal cortex from AUD subjects [112], revealing upregulation of majority of differentially expressed miRNAs in alcohol-dependent individuals, including a string of 4 miRNAs (miR-299-3p, miR-377, miR-379, and miR-493) from the 14q32 chromosomal region. In addition to brain tissues, alterations in several miRNA expression have been demonstrated in blood samples from AUD individuals. Among these miRNAs, miR-92b and miR-96 have been implicated in neuronal development [113]. Similarly, altered miRNAs implicated in synaptic plasticity, chromatin organization, and neuronal differentiation were also observed in the brain of rats following alcohol dependence and withdrawal [114]. In rats with alcohol dependence, a regionally selective upregulation of miR-206 was noted in the medial prefrontal cortex, which binds and inhibits BDNF to prompt escalated alcohol self-administration [115]. These findings have revealed a significant role of ncRNAs in the regulation of AUD development."
11,Epigenetics and ACM,
12,Current understanding for the pathogenesis of ACM,"5.1 Current understanding for the pathogenesis of ACM Several theories have been postulated for the pathogenesis of ACM, including toxicity of ethanol and metabolites, oxidative stress, disturbed Ca2+ homeostasis, and mitochondrial injury (Fig. 1) [23,116]. Alcohol-induced oxidative metabolism results in abundant ROS generation. Overproduction of ROS triggers oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and compromised protein function, contributing to the development of ACM. Other than excessive ROS-evoked severe cellular damage, recent studies from our groups and others have revealed alcohol exposure may be associated with altered membrane composition and permeability as well as intracellular Ca2+ handling, leading to compromised cardiac geometry and function in ACM [23]. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in alcohol-induced multi-organ injuries. The heart is particularly vulnerable to alcohol exposure due to its high demand of energy supply [16]. Ethanol and ethanol metabolite are known to exert their toxicity in mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial DNA damage, oxidative stress, and impaired bioenergetics for ATP synthesis. Furthermore, other pathophysiological mechanisms are also tied with the development of ACM, including apoptosis, cytokine production and inflammatory response."
13,DNA methylation and ACM: is there a possible link?,"5.2 DNA methylation and ACM: is there a possible link? Although compelling evidence is still lacking regarding the role of DNA methylation in ACM development, a large number of studies have revealed a role for DNA methylation in cardiovascular diseases, in particular heart failure and idiopathic cardiomyopathy [117–119]. The first genome-wide DNA methylation study suggested altered global DNA methylation in end-stage cardiomyopathy [120]. In another study, DNA methylation patterns were also detected in heart tissues of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) [121]. Both studies consolidated a vital role of DNA methylation in the regulation of cardiac genes and the progression of DCM. To further reveal the association between DNA methylation and cardiac gene expression, Meder and coworkers detected 59 epigenetic loci associated with DNA methylation in ventricular samples and whole peripheral blood from 135 DCM patients [122]. Moreover, a set of distinct DNA methylation patterns was identified between blood and heart tissues, favoring the potential role of DNA methylation patterns as novel biomarkers in DCM. In addition, DNA methylation alteration is also present in metabolic cardiomyopathies [123], including obesity cardiomyopathy [124], diabetic cardiomyopathy [125,126], and dystrophic cardiomyopathy [127]. Considering the profound impact of ethanol metabolism on epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation may participate in the development of ACM. Further study is warranted to establish the precise role of DNA methylation of cardiac genes in ACM."
14,Histone modification in ACM,"5.3 Histone modification in ACM Ample evidence has shown that prenatal alcohol exposure induces histone modification and influences the fetal development of heart, leading to congenital heart diseases. In vitro studies have shown alcohol and its metabolites promoted HAT activity and H3K9 acetylation and led to alterations in genes associated with heart development [128,129]. Similarly, other studies have revealed a crucial role for histone modification in alcohol-induced fetal cardiomyocyte apoptosis, likely through H3K9 acetylation near promoter regions of pro-apoptotic genes [130]. Curcumin, an HAT inhibitor, was shown to reverse hyperacetylation at H3K9 in cardiac progenitor cells and thus protect against alcohol-induced changes in gene expression and heart geometry [130,131]. However, inhibition of H3K9 hyperacetylation failed to fully reverse cardiac malformation triggered by prenatal alcohol exposure [132]. Further studies revealed involvement of histone H3K9me3 hypomethylation in alcohol-induced heart dysplasia, in association with alcohol-induced inhibition of G9α HMT activity and alterations in cardiogenesis gene during pregnancy [133]. At present, direct evidence is still lacking for a role of histone modifications in the etiology of ACM. Preliminary finding from our own group revealed that chronic alcohol consumption led to a significant decrease in H3K9 acetylation, accompanied with dampened contractile function in the heart as evidenced by suppressed cardiomyocyte contraction. Interestingly, administration of TSA (an HDAC inhibitor) restored H3K9 acetylation and improved cardiomyocyte contractile function (Supplementary materials, Fig. S1), suggesting a unique role for H3K9 acetylation in the pathogenesis of ACM. Besides, numerous studies have revealed a pivotal role of histone modification in cardiovascular diseases, including cardiomyopathies [134]. In cardiac tissues from end-stage cardiomyopathic patients, a global alteration of histone modification was noted, including a general decreased level of histone H3K4me3, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 [135]. Interestingly, these histone modifications were partially reversed following left ventricular assist device implantation accompanied with improved cardiac function [135]. These findings suggest a close relationship between histone modifications and cardiomyopathy. Further study is warranted to discern the precise role of histone modification in the development of ACM.

Further study is warranted to discern the precise role of histone modification in the development of ACM."
15,Non-coding RNA in ACM,"5.4 Non-coding RNA in ACM Recently, several studies have revealed that chronic alcohol exposure also leads to altered ncRNA profile in the heart tissue, en route to impairment of cardiovascular function and onset of ACM [136]. Several studies have profiled the miRNA signature in blood from ACM patients in comparison with healthy subjects [137]. Patients with ACM displayed alterations in several miRNAs (miR-138, miR-506, miR-512-3p, miR-548c-3p, miR-485-5p, miR-1285, miR-4262, and miR-K12-1), which are implicated in signaling pathways and functions associated with cardiac homeostasis [137]. Among these altered miRNAs, miR-138 was represented as an early diagnostic biomarker for ACM. Further studies are required to illustrate the source (cardiac or non-cardiac) and unique function of these miRNAs. In a recent study using murine ACM models, 19 miRNAs and 265 circular RNAs were differentially expressed in heart tissues of alcohol-treated groups [136]. Alcohol exposure in rat cardiomyocytes overtly increased the miR-378a-5p levels and inhibited the expression of alcohol detoxification enzyme ALDH2, with the specific interaction between miR-378a-5p and 3′-untranslated region of ALDH2 mRNA [110]. These findings suggested an involvement of miR-378a-5p in alcohol-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and development of ACM via ALDH2 gene inhibition. In an ethanol-challenged cardiomyocyte model, miR-186-5p expression was significantly upregulated, leading to overt cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) [138]. Similarly, chronic alcohol consumption was also suggested to increase levels of miR-214 to prompt cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the effect of which was attenuated by the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil [139]. Importantly, several studies have suggested the involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of autophagy in ACM. Autophagy is a highly conservative process by which damaged or long-lived proteins and organelles are degraded, and plays a significant role in the development of cardiac diseases including ACM [22,140]. Notably, alcohol exposure was shown to reduce miR-30a expression, which serves as a target of autophagy protein Beclin1 in cardiomyocytes [17]. In another study, Liang and colleagues reported that hydrogen sulfide effectively reversed chronic alcohol intake-induced rises in miR-21 and miR-221 as well as autophagy, thereby protecting against alcohol-induced myocardial remodeling (collagen deposition and myocardial fibrosis) [141]. MiR-138 is shown to be differentially expressed in ACM patients and is implicated in the regulation of autophagy signaling [142,143]. These findings suggested a potential connection between miRNAs and autophagy regulation in ACM. An overview of changes in ncRNA in ACM is summarized in Table 4 ."
16,Pharmacological intervention targeting epigenetics in AUD,"Recently, epigenetic therapies have garnered much interest from physicians, scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry with the prospect of treating diseases, in particular a wide variety of cancers [144]. Here we discuss two drug classes targeting DNA and histone-modifying enzymes (DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors) which are shown to be effective in AUD treatment (Table 5 ). In addition, ncRNA-based therapies may represent a novel pharmacological target for AUD and associated complications."
17,Status of current pharmacological treatment of AUD,"6.1 Status of current pharmacological treatment of AUD Pharmacotherapies for AUD mainly aim at lowering alcohol intake while maintaining alcohol abstinence. To-date, three FDA-approved drugs have been used to maintain abstinence, including acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone, while two other drugs are associated with a reduction of alcohol intake, nalmefene and baclofen [145]. Non-FDA-approved medications with a goal to lower intake while maintaining alcohol abstinence were also tested for AUD, including gabapentin, ondansetron, prazosin/doxazosin, prazosin/doxazosin and varenicline [70]. Although available medications are effective in reducing alcohol intake and maintaining abstinence, 40–70% of AUD patients still suffer from relapse within a year following treatment [146]. Therefore, it is imperative to identify novel effective treatment modalities to cut down alcohol consumption, maintain abstinence and prevent alcohol relapse."
18,DNMT inhibitors,"6.2 DNMT inhibitors To-date, two DNMT inhibitors are approved by FDA to correct abnormal DNA methylation in cancers namely 5-azacytidine and decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine). It was suggested that manipulations of DNMT enzymes may also alter alcoholic complications. In alcohol dependence animal models, DNMT inhibition has proven to be an effective therapeutic option by modifying global and promoter-specific DNA methylation associated with addiction neurocircuitry. Fig. 4 illustrates the chemical structure of DNMT inhibitors which are effective in reducing alcohol intake in animal models. Excessive alcohol intake leads to upregulation of DNMT1, while administration of DNMT inhibitors, including systemic intraperitoneal 5-azacytidine and intracerebroventricular infusion of RG108, contributes to a significant reduction in global DNA methylation in the nucleus accumbens, and decreases alcohol intake and binge-like behaviors [67,68]. Furthermore, DNMT inhibition using RG108 was also found to increase synaptic plasticity-associated gene transcription and reverse alcohol-induced hypermethylation to regulate drinking behaviors [68]. Decitabine, an FDA-approved DNMT inhibitor, also lowered alcohol intake and preference in binge-like drinking and chronic intermittent drinking models [147]. Further studies have revealed that decitabine-induced decrease in alcohol intake is associated with alterations in the brain reward mechanism in the ventral tegmental area [147]. It is noteworthy that discrepant effects were noted for DNMT inhibition. For example, intracerebroventricular injection of 5-azacytidine prior to multiple bouts of alcohol vapor was shown to promote voluntary alcohol drinking [148]. In a study using primary cortical astrocytes, acute alcohol exposure and DNMT inhibition via decitabine both led to increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator, which may be involved in astrocytes-mediated neural plasticity inhibition [66]. In contrary to the expected therapeutic effects on chronic alcohol exposure, DNMT inhibition using 5-azacytidine mimicked unfavorable effects of alcohol on neural stem cell dynamics [149], while methyl-supplemented diet surprisingly ameliorated, although only partially, alcohol teratogenesis following prenatal alcohol exposure [150]. Methyl donor supplementation therapy using choline and its metabolite betaine has been shown to reverse DNA hypomethylation and alleviate alcohol anomalies during prenatal alcohol exposure [151]. The effects of DNMT inhibition may vary depending on the DNA methylation state and duration of treatment. As mentioned earlier, DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation are instigated by acute and chronic alcohol exposure, respectively. Use of DNMT inhibitors prior to prolonged exposure promoted voluntary drinking [148], while DNMT inhibitor utilization after chronic exposure or withdrawal stage reduced subsequent alcohol self-administration [67,68]. Although further clinical evidence is required, these reports unveiled the value of DNA methylation intervention in AUD and suggest that DNMT inhibition can serve as a promising pharmacotherapy for AUD."
19,HDAC inhibitors,"6.3 HDAC inhibitors Both acute and chronic alcohol exposures, as well as alcohol withdrawal, have been shown to lead to histone acetylation alterations [99,106]. These alterations in histone acetylation induced by alcohol may play an important role in the regulation of neuroadaptation, which ultimately causes AUD development. As aforementioned evidence suggests, acute and chronic alcohol exposure decreases and promotes HDAC gene expression in peripheral blood, respectively [96]. Therefore, modulating HDAC activity may become a novel approach to reverse alcohol-induced changes in histone acetylation, thereby serving as a pharmaceutical treatment for AUD. Recent studies revealed that HDAC inhibitors are effective in decreasing excessive alcohol consumption and relapse in animal models, revealing their therapeutic promises in the treatment of AUD. Here, we provide recent evidence of several specific types of HDAC inhibitors in the therapeutics of alcoholism, including TSA, vorinostat, sodium butyrate, and entinostat (MS-275) (Fig. 5 ). Ample evidence has suggested that TSA, a selective HDAC class I and class II inhibitor, effectively retards voluntary alcohol intake in animal models [67,152,153]. Administration with TSA in rats during alcohol withdrawal also normalized HDAC activity and histone H3 and H4 acetylation decrease, thereby attenuating anxiety-like behavior [72]. Specifically, TSA prevents alcohol withdrawal syndrome and rescues the decreases in H3K9 acetylation, BDNF, NPY and Arc expression within amygdaloid regions [108]. Besides, TSA-treated mice with alcohol dependence exhibited low HDAC2 levels in central and medial nucleus of the amygdala [153]. Chronic alcohol consumption is associated with a condensed chromatin structure and subsequent alteration in gene expression, the effect of which can be rescued by TSA treatment [154]. In addition to TSA, other HDAC inhibitors also display similar inhibitory effects on alcohol intake and withdrawal syndrome. Vorinostat or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is an FDA-approved HDAC class I, II, and IV inhibitor which is effective to reduce ethanol intake and inhibit the motivation to seek alcohol in animal models [67]. Sodium butyrate is a class I and class IIa HDAC inhibitor and has shown promising therapeutic effects. In a study using alcohol-dependent rat models, sodium butyrate strongly reduced excessive ethanol intake and prevented the escalation of alcohol intake in the intermittent access to 20% ethanol paradigm [155]. In addition, sodium butyrate blocked alcohol deprivation-induced alcohol consumption, suggesting a preventive value on alcohol relapse [155]. Similarly, other studies have shown sodium butyrate prevented the escalation of response to hyperlocomotor effect of alcohol exposure and reversed the expression of alcohol-induced locomotor sensitization in mice [156,157]. These effects are associated with specific gene regulations in BDNF in prefrontal cortex and striatum [157]. Entinostat, a selective class I inhibitor, reduced operant alcohol self-administration in ethanol-dependent rats [67,155,158]. After 2 months of excessive intake in rats, intracerebroventricular administration of entinostat generated a series of therapeutic effects: (1) operant alcohol self-administration decreased by 75%, (2) motivation to consume alcohol decreased by 25%, and (3) the relapse phenomenon decreased by 50% [158]. Altogether, these findings favored the benefit of HDAC inhibitors in decreasing alcohol consumption and relapse, and these compounds may be a promising novel therapeutic option for AUD."
20,Non-coding RNA-based therapy: potential validation and challenges,"6.4 Non-coding RNA-based therapy: potential validation and challenges Influencing ncRNA expression may present as a potential therapeutic strategy for alcoholic complications. Both induction and inhibition of miRNAs are effective in theory. Depending on the context of alcoholic complications, function of miRNAs can either be mimicked by delivery systems, or suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides targeting miRNA transcript. Available data have suggested therapeutic potentials for activation or inhibition of miRNAs in the treatment of ALD. Human subjects and rodents with ALD exhibited a lowered miR-122 level, and restoration of miR-122 in hepatocytes significantly protected against ALD development [159]. The ncRNA-based therapies are still in their infancy, and no clinical trial has been conducted to investigate the miRNA-based therapies specifically for AUD. The major obstacle is the delivery strategies for miRNA mimics (to facilitate transcript) and anti-miRNAs (to inhibit transcript function). Given that a given miRNA may differentially regulate multiple target genes in various cell types, specificity remains a main challenge for ncRNA-based therapy. Therefore, unexpected off-target effects should be considered in ncRNA-based therapy."
21,Concluding remarks,"Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, as well as ncRNAs, link environmental cues to genomic expression patterns. Here we review the role of current epigenetic regulation (DNA methylation, histone modifications and ncRNAs) evoked by alcohol consumption (both acute and chronic) in the development of AUD and ACM. These epigenetic marks present in blood are relatively stable and may serve as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis AUD and comorbidities. Epigenetics-targeting drugs, such as DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors, are deemed effective to reverse alcohol-induced epigenetic alterations, and reduce alcohol intake and ethanol withdrawal behaviors in animal models. Surprisingly, certain epigenetic medications can diminish alcohol relapse, revealing the therapeutic promises of epigenetic drugs for AUD and associated complications. To the best of our knowledge, no DNMT inhibitor or HDAC inhibitor has been indicated for psychiatric diseases clinically. Only a few clinical studies have examined the efficacies of epigenetic drugs in psychiatry diseases, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. The promising results of these preclinical and clinical studies may encourage future studies in the therapeutic effects on the fields of AUD and other psychiatry disorders. With the tremendous advances of modern techniques, further large-scale studies may considerably push to a deeper understanding of the relationship between epigenome and AUD and ACM, and the development of novel epigenetic therapies.
