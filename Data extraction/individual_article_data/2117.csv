0,Introduction,"The exploration for alternative energy sources has become a necessity due to the reduction of worldwide fossil fuel resources coupled with the endless rise in energy demand. The use of biomass is considered as a clean alternative energy resource due to its renewability and relatively low CO2 and low sulfur value levels. In many areas, the operation of biomass energy has been widely improved. Through thermo-chemical processes, it can be converted into hydrogen and hydrogen-rich gas. Thermo-chemical conversion methods generally includes steam reforming, pyrolysis, gasification, and high-pressure supercritical conversion [1]. There are lots of components in bio-oil derived from biomass which comprises of ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, acetic acid and phenols [2,3]. A complete study on bio-oil derived from diverse biomass remains reveals that acids, phenols and ketones are the major ones with 19wt.%, 30wt.% and 21wt.% weight percentages respectively. Hence, in studies on catalytic steam reforming phenol, acetic acid (HOAc) and hydroxyacetone are mostly employed as generic model combinations for each group [4]. The phenols, acetic acids and phenolic compounds are not considered as fuels and they are corrosive to combustion engines. A typical bio-oil generation results in 30wt.% acetic acids [5] and 38wt.% phenols [6] as unwanted components of pyrolysis oil. The methods used for hydrogen production from biomass are catalytic steam reforming of biomass pyrolysis oil and gasification. Among the economic advantages of bio-oil steam reforming process includes its easy operation and high yield of hydrogen [7,8]. For more than two decades, significant research efforts have been dedicated towards improving the process for hydrogen production. Ketonization, water shift reaction, methanation, and thermal analysis reaction are possible reactions which may occur through acetic acid-phenol steam reforming [9–11]. Phenols contain an OH group, which is bonded to one of the sp2 carbon atoms of a benzene ring. The phenol family includes the parent compound as well as a wide variety of other compounds having additional substituent attached to the phenol ring [12,13]. Moreover, steam reforming requires the lowest process temperature and produces higher H2/CO2 ratio in product compared to other possible methods like dry reforming (DR), partial oxidation (POX) and coal gasification [9–11,14]. Nickel-based catalyst has been commonly used for steam reforming of bio-oil due to its high selectivity and activity towards hydrogen production [15–17]. In particular, Ni-based catalysts were found to be effective for tar destruction, thereby producing high yields of synthesis gas [18,19]. Due to their low attrition resistance, these catalysts are generally placed downstream in the gasifier in a separate fixed-bed reactor [19,20]. On the other hand, Cobalt-based catalyst is an appropriate catalyst for steam reforming of bio-oil due to its advantages of having no catalyst inventory cost and low temperature towards high hydrogen yield. Cobalt has the capability to promote CC bond rupture at temperatures as low as 400°C and supported cobalt catalysts show higher production of H2 and CO2 with lower ethylene production [21]. The activity and selectivity properties of La2O3 are the reasons for the selection of rare-earth oxides as supports. It is used to develop ferroelectric and optical materials [22]. The chemical and hydrothermal stabilities of γ-Al2O3 are critical points for catalytic applications [23]. Studies on hydrogen production with Ni as active species supported on SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 resulted in 98.4% and 83.5% conversion of acetic acid and phenol respectively [3]. Sun et al. [24] studied hydrogen production from ethanol at low temperature using Ni/Y2O3,Ni/La2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for fuel-cell application. It was found that the Ni supported on Al2O3 exhibited lower relative activity and selectivity. The low feed conversion, low activity of Ni-Al2O3 catalyst were the obstacles of previous researches. This is due to coke formation behavior of alumina support during the steam reforming. In another research by Kan et al. on crude bio oil reforming using Ni-Cu-Zn-Al catalyst, the hydrogen yield and feed conversion were found to be 64% and 74%, respectively [25]. These low conversion and low hydrogen yield could be attributed to the high complexity of real bio-oil [3]. To improve the catalyst activity towards hydrogen production and phenol and acetic acid conversion, Nickel/Cobalt supported on different series of gamma-aluminum oxide and Lanthanum (III) Oxide could be applied in the reforming process. The advantage of the investigation of different series of La2O3 and γ-Al2O3 supports is to avoid the coke formation after steam reforming which is mostly favorable for γ-Al2O3 support. The active metal of Ni and noble-based catalysts used in hydrogen production are more energetic and effective and offer good hydrogen incomes in acetic acid and phenol steam reforming. In the present work, the Ni-Co catalyst employed has a lower cost compared to noble metals such as ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and iridium (Ir) [26–29]. Moreover, Ni catalysts used in bio-oil and biomass gasification are highly promising. In addition to different series of La2O3 and γ-Al2O3 supports, diluting agents such as Glass, quartz, alumina, and silicon carbide (SiC) can play an important role in catalyst activity because of their good heat transfer properties [30] and difference in catalyst bed height [31]. Moreover, catalyst dilution can increase the performance of complex successive reaction schemes over undiluted catalyst [32] and can significantly reduce the overall cost of the catalyst [33]. The recent work aims to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of this low cost and high performance bimetallic Ni-Co catalyst supported on La2O3 and γ-Al2O3 for steam reforming of the mixture phenol and acetic acid with silicon carbide (SiC) as dilution agent."
1,Experimental work,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Cobalt and nickel supported on γ-Al2O3 and La2O3 were prepared using impregnation technique. The advantage of impregnation method is that it produce high concentration of active materials on the catalyst surface [34]. The procedure of this method was reported by Athanasios et al. [9]. For the first catalyst sample, 5wt.% Ni and 5wt.% Co as the active metals were deposited on 45wt.% La2O3 and 45wt.% γ-Al2O3 supports. The weight percentages of Ni and Co were btained from Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (nickel nitrate hexahydrate with 98.5% purity, the 1.5% impurities are the presence of other chemical elements) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (cobalt nitrate hexahydrate with 99.999% purity) respectively as shown in Eq. (1). A m o u n t o f X ( g ) = 0.5 g r a m N i ( o r ) C o × 1 m o 1 N i ( o r ) C o 58.7 g r × 1 m o 1 X 1 m o 1 N i ( o r ) C o × 291 g r X 1 m o 1 X = 2.47 g o f ( C o ( N O 3 ) 2 ⋅ 6 H 2 O ) ( o r ) ( N i ( N O 3 ) 2 ⋅ 6 H 2 O ) (1) 0.5g nickel, 0.5g cobalt with 9g supports, and 250ml de-ionized water were mixed in order to prepare the catalyst, which consisted of 5% Ni-5% Co/90% supports. In a similar way, the weight percentages of various other catalysts were computed, as shown in Table 1 . The mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer and heated to 90°C until it turned into a highly viscous paste. The paste was put into an oven at 110°C and dried overnight. Subsequently, the catalyst was calcined at 750°C overnight in a furnace. It was pelletized and sieved on two layers of 35 and 34mesh to obtain particles size between 1.0mm and 1.4mm."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Crystalline structure of the reduced catalyst was determine by X-ray diffraction (High Resolution X-Ray Diffractometer brand Bruker D8 Advance) using a Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 30mA. The total surface area of the catalysts was measured using the multipoint BET-N2 on a surface area analyzer (Micromeritics, Gemini 2360). Prior to the analysis, the samples were degassed at 200°C for 2h to remove unwanted components on the surface before outgassing the samples. A chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics Chemisorb 2720) was used to evaluate the reducibility of the active metals (nickel and cobalt) on the support by applying temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (TPR-H2). Before the reduction, 25mg of the catalyst was treated at 300°C under high purity 99.99% helium with the flow rate of 20ml/min for an hour to remove moisture and other gas impurities. The TPR-H2 profile was obtained by ramping the temperature at 10°C/min, 20ml/min of 10% (vol.) H2/Ar between 50°C and 800°C. The same apparatus (Micromeritics Chemisorb 2720 Chemisorption) was used for CO2 TPD. Prior to adsorption, 35mg of the sample was kept under 30ml/min of argon flow rate at 600°C for 60min, then cooled down to 25°C and kept under 20ml/min of helium flow rate for 30min so as to remove the adsorbed impurities completely. The CO2 saturation of the catalyst was carried out for 30min under 20ml/min of CO2. A 10°C/min linear heating rate over temperature range of 50–800°C was used for CO2 desorption. A similar method was applied for TPD-NH3 except that the adsorbate gas was 5% NH3 in Argon. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profiles were carried out in Perkin Elmer TGA instrument operated under nitrogen flowing at the heating rate of 10°C/min. Exothermic weight loss was observed at the temperature range of 30–950°C. This can be assigned to the combustion of deposited carbon."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis The experimental setup for the catalytic steam reforming is shown in Fig. 1 . In the experiment, 0.2g of the catalyst with particle size between 1.0 and 1.4mm was placed on a stainless steel mesh in a 1/2inch O.D stainless steel reactor tube. Prior to the experiment, the catalyst was reduced in-situ at 600°C for an hour in purified hydrogen of 30sccm. The feed which is a 10% wt mixture of acetic acid and phenol in aqueous solution, was fed into the reactor using a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump (model: Bio-RadTM, Series 1350) with a flow rate of 0.36ml/min. Nitrogen as the carrier gas mixed with liquid was controlled at 30sccm using a mass flow controller (Tylan FC-260C) and channeled into a pre-heater which was set at 200°C to vaporize the nitrogen completely. The effect of the reactor and the wire mesh made of stainless steel on the reaction was ignored. At other experimental runs to investigate the effect of catalyst dilution, the catalyst was mixed with 3g of silicon carbide (SiC) in a mesh of size 35. A thermocouple type K was used to control the temperature of the furnace in order to monitor the temperature on the catalyst bed. The reaction product which exited preposition from the reactor was cooled at 10°C in a graham glass condenser. The condensate and the gas product were separated in a gas liquid separator. The gas was analyzed using an online GC-TCD (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a Carboxen Plot 1010 capillary column (Fused Silica, 30m×0.53mm). Once the gas was injected into the GC, the liquid was collected and analyzed using a GC-FID (HP5890 Series II) eluted in a CP-Wax 58 CB (Varian, 25m×0.32mm) capillary. Eqs. (2)–(4) were applied to compute the conversion, the product mole fraction and the hydrogen yield. (2) Feed conversion ( % ) = [ feed ] in − [ feed ] out [ feed ] in × 100 % (3) Mole fraction = mole of each product component total moles of products (4) H 2 yield ( % ) = moles of H 2 obtained moles of H 2 stochiometric potential × 100"
5,Results and discussions,"In this section, results of the catalyst characterization, catalyst performance and comparison of the reaction with and without catalyst dilution at different temperature were discussed. In addition, results of experiments performed in order to investigate the effect of different parameters such as temperature and concentration on the conversion and hydrogen selectivity without catalyst dilution were as well discussed."
6,"Performance test for NC/La, NC/LaAl, and NC/Al catalysts","3.1 Performance test for NC/La, NC/LaAl, and NC/Al catalysts The performance of the Ni-Co catalyst was investigated on three different supports. These are; Ni-Co over La2O3 (NC/La), Ni-Co over 45wt.% of La2O3 and 45wt.% of γ-Al2O3 (NC/LaAl) and Ni-Co over γ-Al2O3 (NC/Al). Fig. 2 a shows the levels of acetic acid and phenol conversion over at reaction temperature of 800°C. It was found that complete conversion of acetic acid has been achieved for all the catalysts. A maximum phenol conversion of 98% was achieved with the NC/Al catalyst. Moreover, the highest hydrogen yield (41.8%) was achieved with the NC/Al catalyst as depicted on Fig. 2b. The results show that NC/Al catalyst has better activity towards feed conversion and hydrogen production as compared to NC/LaAl and NC/La catalysts. Since Aluminum is more prone to coking, Ni-Co/La1AlM (M: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) was chosen as a support for this work."
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization 3.2.1 BET surface area Table 2 shows the total BET surface area (m2/g) of the Ni-Co/La1AlM (M: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) catalysts. The total BET surface area of the prepared catalyst was significantly affected by the addition of γ-Al2O3 in the support. It can be seen that the surface area for the catalyst supported with equal amount of La2O3 and γ-Al2O3 was 48.8m2/g. The area increases as the ratio of γ-Al2O3 in the support increases up to 76.2(m2/g) for NC/La1Al5 catalyst. The Alumina support displays the larger surface area than Lanthanum oxide. This is in agreement with previous researches [35–37]. 3.2.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The XRD patterns of the various catalysts were shown in Fig. 3 . The result is aimed at investigating possible structural changes in the crystallinity of the NC/La1AlM catalysts after the reduction process at 600°C. The characteristic diffraction peaks of metallic Ni° (111) [JCPDS 01-1258] and Co° (111) [JCPDS: 01-1254] are located at 2θ =44.4° [38] and were hard to distinguish from each other due to their similar morphology and characteristic peaks [39]. For all the catalysts, there was no NiO or CoO peak detected. This was probably due to the complete or partial reduction of NiO and CoO to metallic Ni° [40,41] and metallic Co° [42], respectively. The XRD patterns of La2O3 [JCPDS 73-2141] showed peaks at 2θ =26.09, 29.94, 39.49, 52.14, 55.89 representing the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 1 1), (3 1 0) and (2 2 2) crystal plane of hexagonal phase respectively [43–45]. The XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts showed one peaks at approximately 2θ =46.6° corresponding to (2 2 0) planes related to γ-Al2O3 [JCPDS 46-1131] crystalline structure [46,47]. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2, by increasing the amount of γ-Al2O3 amount in the catalysts support, a loss of crystallinity of the original material was observed. Adding γ-Al2O3 in the catalyst results in shift of the peaks of Ni, Co and La2O3 to lower angles. This shows that these three components were substituted by γ-Al2O3. 3.2.3 Temperature programmed reduction-H2 (TPR-H2) Fig. 4 illustrates the TPR-H2 profiles for the various Ni-Co over La1AlM (M=1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) supports using 10% vol H2-Ar gas after calcination at 750°C overnight. The total consumption of hydrogen for all catalysts were summarized in Table 2. The TPR profile of the NC/La1AlM (M: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) catalysts has one peak at 372. The peak corresponds to the reduction of NiO [48,49] and CoO [50] to metallic Ni° and Co°, respectively which is in agreement with XRD analysis. The addition of γ-Al2O3 leads to the 372°C peak broadening in addition to reduction of its intensity with a weak metal-support interaction. 3.2.4 Temperature programmed desorption The CO2-TPD test profile and CO2 uptake quantity data for the calcined catalyst are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2 respectively. Generally, those peaks that appear below 200°C were categorized as weak, those at 200–400°C as medium, those at 400–600°C as strong and above 600°C as very strong basic sites [51]. It can be seen that NC/La1Al1 and NC/La1Al2 catalysts have four distinct disruption peaks corresponding to weak, medium, strong and very strong basic site. The total CO2 uptake was maximum for NC/La1Al1 catalyst and decreased with increase in the addition γ-Al2O3. It can be observed that the La2O3 significantly improve the basicity of the catalyst [52]. The NC/La1Al3 catalyst shows two desorption peaks at 118 and 234°C which corresponds to weak and medium basic site. In contrast, The NC/La1Al4 catalyst resulted in three desorption peaks at 137, 264 and 448°C corresponding to weak, medium and strong basic sites. The NC/La1Al5 catalyst (with highest γ-Al2O3 content) shows the lowest basic site. These results suggest that γ-Al2O3 loading can poison the basic site of the catalysts. To check if the type of the metal deposited on La1AlM (M: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) support affects the acidity of the final catalyst, ammonia-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-NH3) experiment were employed. Fig. 6 illustrates the TPD-NH3 profiles as function of temperature on five calcined bimetallic Ni-Co catalysts. The total amount of ammonia desorbed is reported in Table 2. The TPD-NH3 result indicates two peaks in different position for all the catalysts except NC/La1Al5 which appeared as a single peak at 218°C. The acidic sites were distributed in two desorption regions, which were around 440°C for all the catalysts except for NC/La1Al5 at 680°C. NC/La1Al1 and NC/La1Al2 were associated with weak and strong acid sites respectively. On the basis of data shown in Table 2, the concentration of acid sites in calcinced catalysts decreases in the order: NC/La1Al1>NC/La1Al2 >NC/La1Al3 >NC/La1Al4>NC/La1Al5. Ignacio et al. [53] found that La2O3 has more acid cite than Al2O3, therefore, it is clear that the addition of γ-Al2O3 and lessening of La2O3 metal oxides reduced the acidity of the catalysts. This is decreasing of acid site of catalyst is possibly from the molybdate anions interaction with hydroxyl groups on γ-Al2O3 surface during the calcination of the catalysts [54]. This interaction can also lead to a decreasing stronger metal-support interaction between Ni and support γ-Al2O3 [55]. The acidity is helpful in the reduction of the carbon deposit over catalysts and extends the work life of catalysts."
8,Catalyst activity test NC/La1AlM,"The catalytic performance of the various NC/La1AlM (M: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) catalysts on the steam reforming of phenol and acetic acid are shown in Fig. 7 . It depicts the conversion and the product yields obtained during the 6h testing at 800°C with steam to feed=9:1 and catalyst to SiC ratio of 2:3. At this reaction temperature, 100% conversion of the acetic acid was achieved. Therefore, only the phenol conversion were presented as depicted in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the NC/La1Al1 exhibits relatively poor reaction activity. This might be due to its low surface area. Increase in the amount of γ-Al2O3 as part of the catalyst support results in the gradual increase in the phenol conversion and hydrogen yield from 95.7% and 35.7% for NC/La1Al1 to 97.9% and 40.4% for NC/La1Al5 catalyst respectively. The effect of silicon carbide (SiC) as a catalyst dilution agent to the steam reforming reaction of acetic acid and phenol was examined. It obvious that for all catalysts, the SiC affects both phenol conversion and the gases yield. A clear increase of the catalyst activity with SiC addition was observed. Base on Fig. 7a, NC/La1Al2 activity was highly influenced by the SiC dilution resulting in 97.4% phenol conversion as compared to the undiluted one which yielded 95.9% phenol conversion. For the rest of the catalysts, dilution with SiC affected the phenol conversions achieved as well. Fig. 7b shows the H2, CO, CH4, and CO2 product yields from the acetic acid and phenol steam reforming. It can be seen that for all of the catalysts, the SiC increases the water gas shift reaction which results in higher hydrogen yield."
9,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"Fig. 8 illustrates the carbon removal from the catalysts using TGA analysis for all the five spent catalysts. The tests were performed at 800°C, 0.2g catalyst, 0.36ml/min feed flow rate and feed concentration of 5wt.% phenol with 5wt.% acetic acid and 90wt.% of water. For all five catalyst weight loss occurred. The decrease in the weight could be due to the combustion of deposited carbons on the catalyst. It can be seen that the thermogravimetric analysis patterns of NC/La1Al1 catalyst demonstrate the lowest phases in the carbon removal process. This is because of strong interaction of metal-support [56] of NC/La1Al1 catalyst which is decreased by increasing the γ-Al2O3 metal oxide (analyzed by TPR-H2). The ratio of total weight loss is about 1.6wt.% for this catalyst. A maximum 7.2% weight loss was observed in the NC/La1Al5 catalysts. The reason for this may be due to the removal of outer surface carbons and some volatile compounds. It shows that the addition of γ-Al2O3 can increase the catalyst activity towards feed conversion and hydrogen production but at the same time increases the coke formation of the catalyst which is one of the major problems of the catalysts. Therefore NC/La1Al1 had an advantage over NC/La1Al5 due to its stability towards coke formation, high basicity, acidity and reducibility."
10,Catalytic activity test for NC/La1Al1,"The reaction was carried out in the temperature range of 600–800°C with La2O3 to γ-Al2O3 ratio of 1:1 supported catalyst (NC/La1Al1). The experiment was carried out at ambient pressure and with a feed flow rate of 0.36ml/min and 0.2g of catalyst. The feed concentration of were 5wt.% phenol, 5wt.% acetic acid and 90wt.% water. The effect of different temperatures on steam reforming with mixture of acetic acid and phenol in the feed was studied. The catalyst was tested with and without SiC dilution and the result is shown on Fig. 9 . However, the catalyst dilution has the ability to increase the performance for complex successive reaction schemes over the undiluted catalyst [32]. In addition, dilution of the catalyst can significantly reduce the overall cost of the catalyst [33]. It was observed that at 800°C, highest feed conversion of 100% acetic acid and 95.7% phenol were recorded. At 600°C reaction temperature, lowest conversion of 30.7% phenol and 85.4% acetic acid were observed. It can be concluded that catalyst dilution had beneficial effect on both components with an important influence on acetic acid at 600–700°C due to the change in catalyst bed height [31]. For example, to check the influence of SiC on the conversion, it can be noted that at 700°C, the conversion of phenol was 70.2%. But by the addition of SiC as catalyst dilution agent, it increased to 77.6% (an additional 7.4%) conversion. The conversion of acetic acid was only slightly affected by SiC as well. It was 85.4% at 600°C which increased to 89.5% with the addition of SiC. Further we compare the performance of our Ni and Co based catalyst with other Ni based catalyst on acetic acid and phenol steam reforming. There is however a few work studied the performance of Ni and Co based catalyst on acetic acid and phenol steam reforming reaction. Basagiannis et al. [57] studied hydrogen production from acetic acid steam reforming using 17wt.% Ni/La2O3/Al2O3 catalyst at H2O/acetic acid molar ratio: 3, flow rate: 290cm3/min, T=800°C, P=1atm. They found that the acetic acid conversion fluctuated by time between 100% and 80% in a recurring periodic cycle. They found that the activity recovery under helium flow did not complete due to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, Basagiannis et al. [10] also studied the acetic acid steam reforming using 17wt.%Ni/La2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. They found the complete conversion of acetic acid to products at 950°C but this catalyst prone to coke formation. Panagiotopoulou et al. [58] stated that the Ni based catalysts are active in the reforming reaction but prone to coke formation which leads to catalyst deactivation. However Xun et al. [59] found that Ni–Co bimetallic catalyst in acetic acid steam reforming reaction had good stability and resistance to carbon deposition at the experimental conditions of S/C mole ratio 7.5:1; LHSV=5.1h−1; P=1atm compare to bare Ni metal and bare Co metal catalysts. Gabriella et al. [60] studied ethanol–phenol (2:1 molar ratio) steam reforming using 5wt.% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. They found that the complete conversion of phenol at 700°C with 85% of H2 yield can be achieved. They stated that this catalyst can be active only at the range of 600–750°C in the time scale. Other work by Gabriella et al. [61] also found that the increasing of La2O3 in the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst leads to increase the catalysts activity towards phenol conversion but the catalyst was deactivate by coke deposition on its surface. The results obtained from previous research were comparable to our work. However, the catalyst preparation method, reaction condition, metal loading and promoter used is responsible for different activity and selectivity as well as the stability of the catalyst in the acetic acid and phenol steam reforming reaction. The total gas yields and the hydrogen gas yield increased with reaction temperature as shown in Fig. 10 . The experiments were performed using a reaction temperature range of 600–800°C, 0.2g catalyst, 0.36ml/min feed flow rate and feed concentration of 5wt.% phenol with 5wt.% acetic acid and 90wt.% of water. The hydrogen yield at 600°C increased from 25.3% for undiluted catalyst to 29% for diluted catalyst. Also, feed conversion and hydrogen yield increased with reaction temperature. At 800°C, feed conversion of 35.7% and 38.4% were observed for the diluted and undiluted catalyst respectively."
11,Conclusions,"The effect of NC/La2AlM (M:1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) in steam reforming of phenol and acetic acid to produce hydrogen was investigated. The results of catalyst characterization indicated that the bimetallic Ni-Co catalyst completely reduced to metallic Ni° and Co° after reduction at 600°C. It was found that incorporation of γ–Al2O3 as part of the catalyst support increased the surface area and the catalyst activity towards higher feed conversion and hydrogen production. On the other hand, the disadvantages of higher percentage of γ-Al2O3 was that it resulted in the increase in coke deposition on the catalyst surface thereby decreasing the acidity, basicity, reducibility and weakens the interaction of active metals with the supports. The acetic-acid and phenol conversion achieved were 100% and 95.7% respectively at 800°C for undiluted NC/La1Al1 catalyst. With SiC dilution, the phenol conversion increased to 97%."
