0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas (H2) is an alternative fuel to reduce the over reliance on fossil fuels as the primary energy used in vehicles and machines. Generally, H2 fuel can be used in conventional gasoline engines with modifications in order to generate energy via combustion in the air [1,2]. The combustion of H2 is sustainable and environmentally friendly because it does not generate greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane [3,4]. Hydrogen also possesses high energy yield (141.9J/kg) among the known fuel types such as methane (55.7J/kg), natural gas (50J/kg), biodiesel (37J/kg) and ethanol (29.9J/kg) [5]. However, more than 96% of global H2 is generated from fossil fuels [6,7]. Therefore, there is an urgency to develop a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly technology to for H2 production. Dark fermentation is a biological approach commonly used to produce H2 in the absence of light [8]. This process does not require solar input and hence the configuration of the bioreactor is simpler and cheaper [9]. Most importantly, this technology has attracted attention because it can use a versatile range of substrate, particularly renewable resources that are organically rich such as stillage, sludge, leachate, pomace, stalks and bagasse [10–12]. Due to cost and environmental concerns, organic waste material is a better choice of substrates than pure compounds such as sugar or starch. This technology allows dark fermentation to be integrated into wastewater treatment systems to produce H2 and to treat wastewater. Seed sludge contains diverse microflora that can produce H2 via dark fermentation [13–16]. Microorganisms found in the seed sludge are more beneficial than pure cultures because they are more adaptive to environmental stresses including limited substrates, and changes in pH and temperature. Moreover, the diverse microflora present in the seed sludge might provide synergistic interactions that improve substrate degradation and thus enhance H2 production. Unfortunately, microflora in the seed sludge usually consists of both H2-consuming and H2-producing bacteria ( Table 1). Therefore, it is essential to eliminate the activity of H2-consuming bacteria (HCB) in order to increase H2 production from H2-producing bacteria (HPB). To achieve this, seed sludge can be pretreated using various physical and chemical pretreatment methods to enrich HPB. However, the search for the most effective pretreatment method for this purpose is still under intensive research. Apart from the variety of HPB involved in dark fermentation, high H2 yield is also associated with fermentation conditions including pH, temperature and types of substrate. These factors influence H2 production by altering the physiological properties such as the enzymatic activities of HPB. In addition, H2 production can be further enhanced by supplements or constrained by inhibitors. Theoretically, a maximum of 12mol of H2 is produced from 1mol of glucose. (1) C6H12O6+6H2O→12H2+6CO2 However, currently the highest reported H2 yield is only about 20% of this maximum yield. Therefore, in order to improve H2 yield, it is important to recognize the major contributing factors in H2 production. This paper critically reviews the challenges of H2 production using seed sludge as inoculum, focusing mainly on (1) the strengths and weaknesses of different pretreatment methods on the seed sludge; and (2) the effects of different factors including types of potential substrate, operation conditions, nutrients and inhibitors, and the diverse microflora in seed sludge."
1,Factors affecting hydrogen production by seed sludge,
2,Effects of sludge pretreatment,"2.1 Effects of sludge pretreatment In order to enhance H2 production, pretreatment is commonly used to enrich HPB. Pretreatment must be able to selectively preserve HPB while eliminating HCB. Untreated seed sludge generally produces low H2 yield (<1.0molH2/mol glucose) and pretreated seed sludge successfully improves H2 yield (Supplementary Tables S1–S4). This is verified by the hydrogenase (primary H2-producing enzyme) activity in the pretreated seed sludge that has been reported to be three fold higher when compared to the untreated seed sludge [28]. These indicate that the pretreatment successfully enriches HPB and increased H2 yield. The pretreatment methods are divided into physical and chemical pretreatments. Physical pretreatments are further separated into heat, ultrasonication, ultraviolet irradiation, aeration, and freeze and thaw methods, while chemical pretreatments include pH pretreatment, and chemical activation and inhibition. The selection of pretreatment methods is important because bacteria react differently to the stress applied. For example, it has been shown that acid pretreated seed sludge that was dominated by HCB, such as Propionibacterium granulosum, produced 10.4 fold less H2 compared to heat treated seed sludge [22]. This suggests that heat pretreatment is the most effective method to eliminate P. granulosum. It demonstrates that the type of pretreatment serves an important role in controlling H2 yield as it directly affects the variety of bacteria that is present in the seed sludge. 2.1.1 Physical pretreatments 2.1.1.1 Heat pretreatment In physical pretreatment, heat pretreatment is the most commonly used method (Supplementary Table S2). This is a simple method that eliminates HCB effectively and has a high potential for commercialization. A review of studies shows that the highest H2 yield was produced by seed sludge pretreated at 65°C which yielded 2.30molH2/mol, that is 8.85 fold higher than the untreated sludge ( Table 2, no. 2). Seed sludge pretreated at this temperature preserved the most types of HPB, and no HCB were detected [18]. This indicates that heat pretreatment successfully eliminated HCB and improved H2 production. On the other hand, heat pretreated seed sludge also significantly enhances the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in wastewater. It has been shown that COD of POME was reduced up to 89% and H2 yield was increased 3.4 fold compared to that of untreated seed sludge [33]. The reduction of COD in wastewater during H2 production signifies the potential of applying heat pretreated sludge for wastewater treatment via dark fermentation. It is challenging to identify the best combination of pretreatment temperature and heating duration in order to further improve H2 yields ( Fig. 1). Among the reported combinations, seed sludge pretreated at 65°C for 30min and 100°C for 15min are the most promising combinations (Table 2, nos. 1 and 2). This suggests that a lower pretreatment temperature may require a longer pretreatment time and vice versa in order to achieve similar H2 yields. In contrast, preheating seed sludge at higher temperatures for longer durations has shown lethal effects on HPB which reduces H2 yield [18,23,36]. For example, in one study seed sludge pretreated at 70°C for 30min produced even lower H2 than the untreated seed sludge (Table 2, no. 8). Similarly, H2 produced by seed sludge pretreated at 95°C was 4.53 fold lower than seed sludge pretreated at 65°C (Table 2, nos. 2 and 5). This variation between H2 productions and pretreatment combinations could be due to the density of cells and the type of microorganisms present in the seed sludge [37,38]. It is reasonable to assume that seed sludge that contains higher cell density requires longer pretreatment durations to ensure all HCB are eliminated. However, the appropriate pretreatment combination is complicated due to the variety of bacteria present in the seed sludge. Depending on the source of the seed sludge, HCB such as Homoacetogens can survive under intensive heat, while HPB such as Enterobacter spp. is easily destroyed during heat pretreatment [31,39]. Therefore, the optimum heat pretreatment temperature and time are dependent on the types of HPB and HCB present in the seed sludge. 2.1.1.2 Ultrasonication Ultrasonication uses sound waves to eliminate HCB. A summary of the H2 yield using this pretreatment is listed in Table 3. This method eliminates HCB by destroying their cell walls. Although the same damage may also occur to HPB, this can be prevented by controlling the pretreatment duration and intensity [40,41]. Ultrasonic pretreatment improves H2 production because ultrasonic waves break the sludge particles into smaller sizes, disintegrate coenobium and increase the interaction between the HPB and the substrate [42,43]. Studies have shown the maximum yield obtained from this method was only 1.03molH2/mol glucose. This yield was only about 8% of the maximum H2 yield that can be produced from 1mol of glucose (Eq. (1)). This shows that this method is less satisfactory than heat pretreatments. Therefore, optimization studies are required, including studies on the power of the ultrasonic waves, time of exposure, and heat control, before this pretreatment method can produce satisfactory results. 2.1.1.3 Ultraviolet irradiation Ultraviolet irradiation has bactericidal action that can eliminate HCB and enrich HPB. The recommended pretreatment condition is 15min of UV irradiation. This condition has successfully eliminated methanogens and increased H2 yield 0.39 fold compared to untreated sludge (Table 3, no. 7). However, the radiation can only be transmitted through the smaller sludge particles that are lighter in color. Hence, HCB inside the larger and darker colored sludge particles are protected from UV irradiation and only HCB present on the surface are eliminated [44]. This method is not as efficient as other physical treatments. 2.1.1.4 Aeration Aeration pretreatment applies oxidative stress to deactivate anaerobic HCB. This pretreatment method is aimed at eliminating methanogens that are sensitive to oxidative stress. However, oxidative stress also damages obligate anaerobic HPB and is less effective against facultative HCB. The inefficiency of aeration pretreatment has been shown to result in low H2 yield (0.7molH2/mol glucose) that is far below the maximum H2 yield (Table 3, no. 8). Hence, this may not be an effective method to enrich HPB in most of the seed sludge. 2.1.1.5 Freeze and thaw This pretreatment method involves freezing and thawing seed sludge simultaneously at an extreme temperature. The freeze and thaw method appears to be the least effective physical pretreatment because seed sludge pretreated using this method has been shown to produce very low H2 yield (0.15molH2/mol glucose) compared to other pretreatment methods (Table 3, nos. 11 and 12). Freezing and thawing seed sludge instantaneously lysed the bacteria, including both HCB and HPB, which in turn reduced H2 yield. Therefore, the freeze and thaw method is not a favored method to enrich HPB due to its detrimental effects on HPB cells. 2.1.2 Chemical pretreatments 2.1.2.1 pH pretreatment The most popular chemical pretreatment method used to enrich HPB is pH pretreatment. This method involves adjusting the pH of seed sludge to an extreme pH such as pH 3 or 12 ( Table 4) and attempting to lyse HCB. In principle, extreme pH induces HPB to form spores. Bacterial spores have rigid cell walls that are difficult to break and hence HPB should survive this pretreatment. However, in reality, most HCB do not form spores and their cell walls are easily disrupted at extreme pH levels [27,30,31,48]. Evidently, an acidic pretreatment is more effective compared to an alkali pretreatment. This is evidenced by the H2 yield produced by acidic pretreated seed sludge which was found to be 1.67 fold higher than alkaline pretreated seed sludge (Table 4 nos. 2 and 19). This suggests that HPB is more susceptible to alkaline pretreatment but the reason is unknown as there are no reports on the effects of alkalinity on HPB survival. Nonetheless, pH pretreatment is still not as effective as heat pretreatment because the H2 yield is not as high. 2.1.2.2 Chemical activation and inhibition Chemical activation pretreatment enriches HPB by spiking or shocking the seed sludge with a selected substrate or medium such as sucrose or rice ( Table 5, nos. 1–6). This method is useful in terms of enriching selective HPB. For example, seed sludge activated with clostridium enforcement medium can enrich HPB like Clostridium spp [17]. It has also been claimed that spiking the seed sludge with sucrose is highly effective in enriching thermophilic HPB such as Thermoanaerobacterium sp. [21]. However, this method is practical only if the specific medium or substrate for the targeted HPB is identified which is often challenging. The chemical inhibition pretreatment can employ toxic chemicals such as chloroform and 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) into the seed sludge to inhibit HCB (Table 5, nos. 7–13). However, these inhibitors are often lethal to the HPB [21,31,33,34] and highly toxic and harmful to humans and the environment. Consequently, it is extremely challenging to search for a suitable and yet environmentally benign inhibitor. Therefore, chemical inhibition pretreatment is the least favorable method for enriching HPB. 2.1.3 Combination pretreatments Combination pretreatment methods combine the strengths of physical and chemical pretreatment methods to improve the selection of HPB. Combination methods employ dual pretreatments such as repeated heating ( Table 6, nos. 2 and 6) or a combination of several pretreatments (Table 6). Studies have shown that heat coupled with acid, acid coupled with BES, and heat coupled with ultrasonic treated seed sludge produced at least two fold more H2 compared to that of individual pretreatments. In addition, the sequence of combination pretreatments plays an important role [50]. For example, it is crucial that heat pretreatment be applied before pretreatment with chloroform [50]. Research has shown that the yield obtained by using heat pretreatment followed by chloroform generated 22% more H2 compared to using chloroform followed by heat (Table 6, nos. 4 and 5). This is because HPB sporulates from heat pretreatment. Since spores are more stress-resistant, the subsequent chemical pretreatment further eliminates HCB and enriches HPB. Currently, the best combination pretreatment, which is heat pretreatment followed by aeration pretreatment, has only produced 1.83molH2/mol glucose (Table 6, no. 1). It is interesting to note that the result of this combination pretreatment is still lower than that of heat pretreatment. This method is established as an alternative to physical or chemical methods when individual pretreatments cannot effectively enrich HPB."
3,Microbial diversity,"2.2 Microbial diversity Sludge containing diverse microorganisms and functional seed sludge that produces H2 is usually enriched by pretreatment methods (Supplementary Table S5). Different pretreatment methods have shown different preservation effects on a variety of bacteria [21,29] and this directly influences the H2 yield. For example, HPB such as Clostridium acetobutylicum is predominant in heat pretreated sludge (Supplementary Table S5, nos. 1, 2, 25); Clostridium spp. is also found in pH pretreated sludge (Supplementary Table S5, nos. 12, 13 and 23); Thermoanaerobacterium sp. is found in load shock pretreated sludge (Supplementary Table S5, no. 9); and Bacillus sp. is found in BES pretreated sludge (Supplementary Table S5, no. 11). There are also some HCB such as Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. which persist even after pretreatment (Supplementary Table S5, nos. 2, 5, 6, 12). Typically, pretreated seed sludge that contains more varieties of HPB and less of HCB produces a higher amount of H2 ( Table 7, nos. 1–9). For example, seed sludge containing only HPB (Table 7, nos. 1–5) was found to produce a higher amount of H2 than seed sludge containing both HPB and HCB (Table 7, nos. 6–9). On top of that, seed sludge containing several strains of Clostridium spp. also produced a higher amount of H2 compared to a single strain or pure culture [14,19,26,54]. This is because different bacteria may utilize different substrates or cooperate in breaking down complex substrates in order to produce H2. This synergistic interaction among a variety of bacteria in seed sludge is more beneficial than a pure culture in terms of H2 production from complex substrates such as wastewater. The variety of HPB which belongs to the family of strict anaerobes Clostridiaceae has the greatest potential in H2 production via dark fermentation [17–19]. Besides high H2 production, Clostridium spp. can also produce H2 from a wide range of substrates such as maltose, cellobiose, starch, glucose, sucrose, xylose, dextrin, paper cellulose, powder cellulose, casein and ground nut oil [20]. This allows Clostridium spp. to produce H2 from waste streams that contain diverse substrates. Ethanoligenens harbinens is a newly identified HPB enriched from aerated seed sludge [22]. It is a strict anaerobe that produces ethanol and H2 simultaneously. This HPB is highly resistant against the bactericidal effect of ethanol during H2 production. This suggests that Ethanoligenens harbinens can be used in ethanol-rich waste for H2 production. Bacillus megaterium is another newly identified HPB [23] isolated from intertidal sludge and it tolerates high salinity levels of up to 15% [55]. This is useful in H2 production from high salinity wastewater or even polluted sea water. In contrast to strict anaerobe, some researchers have suggested that facultative-HPB could be the better H2 producers. Most of the identified facultative-HPB such as Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. [22,24] belong to the family of Enterobacteriaceae. Their higher tolerance to oxygen stress, allows facultative-HPB to act as a shelter for hydrogenase. Hydrogenase can be irreversibly inhibited by oxygen regardless of whether it is present in a strict or facultative-HPB [56,57]. Facultative-HPB is able to recover the activity of hydrogenase by rapidly depleting oxygen which accidentally enters the fermentation medium [57–59]. However, the trade-off to this is that facultative-HPB generates lower amounts of H2 compared to strict anaerobes such as Clostridium spp. Therefore, facultative-HPB in sludge can function as a defense against oxidative stress while maintaining an oxygen free condition for strict anaerobes to produce H2. This shows that the symbiotic interaction between strict and facultative-HPB in seed sludge is important to sustain H2 production."
4,Effects of operation conditions on hydrogen production by sludge inocula,"2.3 Effects of operation conditions on hydrogen production by sludge inocula 2.3.1 Effects of substrate H2 research aims to integrate dark fermentation with waste management. Therefore, many researchers are focusing on H2 production from organic waste in various streams of waste (Supplementary Tables S1–S4). Organic substrates found in wastewaters are cheap and easily available. Hence, they can be used in dark fermentation for H2 production. However, wastewaters are not usually sufficiently nutritious to support H2 production and it is not practical to continuously supply the fermentation process with costly nutrients such as glucose, peptone and yeast extract. One of the solutions is to improve the nutrient content using a combination of different types of wastewaters [60]. The production of H2 significantly increases by combining two different types of waste. For example, food wastewater or cassava stillage is rich in carbohydrate and sewage sludge is rich in nitrogen and other micro-nutrients. When these combined substrates were applied in dark fermentation, H2 yield increased by 0.63 fold [60]. This shows that mixing carbohydrate and nitrogen-rich substrates improves the nutrient content in fermentations and increases H2 yield. In addition, waste from different resources contains varieties of bacteria. The synergetic interaction between microflora from different waste resources also contributes to improved H2 yield from the combined wastes [13]. A combination of wastes from different sources provides an opportunity to enhance H2 production by improving the nutrient content and microbiological profile in the fermentation system. A balanced concentration of substrate also plays an important role in H2 production. It is logical to assume that H2 production increases with substrate concentration. For example, it was found that when the cellobiose concentration increased 2-fold, the H2 yield increased from 1.57 to 2.19molH2/mol hexose [17]. A relatively low substrate concentration is only sufficient to support biomass growth and hence H2 production is restricted [49,61–63]. However, an excessive amount of substrate does not always ensure high H2 production. This is because an excessive amount of substrate increases osmotic pressure and hence inhibits HPB growth. Furthermore, excess substrate inhibits H2 production by shifting fermentation pathways to produce alcohol and/or lactic acid. This will be further discussed in the next section [11]. On the other hand, in the case of ineffective sludge pretreatment, a high substrate concentration provokes methane production from methanogens. When the substrate is in excess, it is rapidly converted into H2 and this leads to the accumulation of H2. The increase in H2 partial pressure triggers methane production from methanogens that are still in the sludge because H2 is the intermediate precursor for methane production [64]. This can be prevented by reducing the substrate input for H2 production as suggested by Chen et al. [64]. Thus, a reasonable amount of substrate in the fermentation is important because limited or excessive substrates inhibit H2 production. Accessibility of HPB to substrates directly influences the sustainability of H2 production. Simple substrates such as glucose and lactose are easily accessible for H2 production. Theoretically, 1mol of glucose (C6H12O6) should produce 12mol of H2 (Eq. (1)), while 1mol of lactose (C12H22O11) will produce 23mol of H2 (Eq. (2)). (2) C12H22O11 +12H2O→23H 2 +12 CO2 Nevertheless, dark fermentation is less efficient in terms of converting substrates to H2 because most thermal enthalpies are lost in the formation of volatile fatty acids (VFA). Typically, the maximum energy conversion from glucose to H2 is only 33% via the acetate pathway (Eq. (3)) and 17% via the butyrate pathway (Eq. (4)). Meanwhile the efficiency of lactose conversion to H2 is only 31% via the acetate and methane pathways (Eqs. (5) and (6)) [65–67]. Glucose fermentation (3) Acetate pathway: C6H12O6+2H2O→4H 2 +2CH3COOH+2CO2 (4) Butyrate pathway: C6H12O6→2H 2 +CH3CH2CH2COOH+2CO2 Lactose fermentation (5) Acetate pathway: C12H22O11 +5H2O→8H 2 +4CO2+4CH3COOH (6) Methane pathway: C12H22O11 +5H2O→8H 2 +8CO2+4CH4 However, achieving the theoretical maximum H2 yield is not feasible. Currently, the highest reported H2 yield is only 2.3molH2/mol glucose which is only about 50% of the theoretical maximum H2 yield [18]. This phenomenon is caused by (1) the rapid conversion of substrate into cell biomass instead of H2 [49,61–63] and (2) an inappropriate combination of fermentation conditions as discussed in this paper. It is postulated that mixed microflora in the seed sludge could overcome this problem via the synergetic interaction among the different bacteria because they can adapt to a wider range of conditions. 2.3.2 Effects of pH The reported optimum pH for H2 production is in the range of pH 6–8 (Supplementary Tables S1–S4). This represents the pH range that supports the growth of many HPB including Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum [11,19,27,49,68–71]. An optimum pH helps to maintain the surface charge on the cell membrane which facilitates nutrient uptake and hence sustains growth of HPB [11,69]. In addition, HPB contains the essential enzyme, hydrogenase, which plays the most important role in H2 production. Hydrogenase is reported to function optimally at a pH range of 6–6.5 [72,73]. Evidence of this was seen in a study when H2 production at a pH level lower than 6 was reduced by half [15] or completely ceased [68]. This shows that pH plays a critical role in sustaining the growth of HPB and the activity of hydrogenase in H2 production. It is also noteworthy that the buffer capacity of the fermentation medium plays an important role in regulating the pH in order to achieve optimum H2 production. Unlike synthetic mediums, natural buffering capacity does not occur in most of the waste resources, hence utilizing waste resources to produce H2 is hampered [34]. Some researchers have suggested that batch fermentation should be initiated at a higher pH level (pH 8–10) [45,74,75] because high initial pH will buffer acid production accordingly and prevent a sharp pH reduction [69]. Zhao et al. [75] and Lee et al. [76] stressed that the medium will become more acidic over time due to the production and accumulation of organic acids during the fermentation process. Hence, a stable pH in the medium is essential to sustain optimum H2 production. 2.3.3 Effect of temperature Temperature determines the physiological activities of HPB. The fermentation temperature for most of the H2 productions was reported in the mesophilic range (20–45°C) (Supplementary Tables S1–S4). This is because most of the HPB present in the seed sludge are mesophiles such as Clostridium spp., Enterobacter spp., and Bacillus spp. that grow in this temperature range [19,77,78]. However, H2 production is only vigorous in a narrow range of temperatures even though HPB may grow in a wide temperature range. For example, Mu et al. [79] detected HPB growth at 33–41°C but the highest H2 yield was obtained at 39°C. From the literature, the most promising temperature range for H2 production is 35–37°C [18,29,48]. This suggests that HPB are only physiologically active in a narrow temperature range for H2 production despite their ability to grow in a wide temperature range. Furthermore, it is argued that H2 production at higher temperatures (>45°C) is favorable. This is because H2 gas is less soluble at high temperatures [11,80,81]. It is also interesting to note that hydrogenase is reported to function optimally in the range of 50–70°C despite many HPB being identified as mesophiles [11,80,81]. This leads to the identification of several thermophiles that belong to the Thermoanaerobacterium genus which produce H2 at thermophilic temperatures (>45°C) [21,37,82]. These bacteria can produce up to 1.96molH2/mol hexose at 60°C after 48h [21]. Thus, thermophiles are suitable to be used in warm or even hot wastewater, such as beverage producing, food processing or pulp and paper industries, because they are able to tolerate a high operation temperature. Temperature is a crucial parameter in dark fermentation because temperatures outside the suitable range will restrain H2 production. 2.3.4 Effects of nutrients and inhibitors 2.3.4.1 Effects of organic acids Fermentative H2 production is accompanied by the formation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) such as acetate, butyrate, propionate, lactate, formate and ethanol. Productions of VFA via different fermentation pathways are influenced by the variety of HPB present in the seed sludge which in turn is determined by the pretreatment method. These pathways are indicated by the ratio of acetate to butyrate which is clearly listed in Tables S2–S4 (supplementary data). When the ratio of acetate to butyrate is larger than one, it represents an acetate pathway (Eq. (3)). Meanwhile, a ratio that is smaller than one indicates the butyrate pathway (Eq. (4)). This further emphasizes that H2 yield is strongly related to the selection of the pretreatment method because this determines the variety of HPB that produces H2. In strict anaerobes, the fermentative pathways are divided into two main routes: acidogenesis (acid production) and solventogenesis (solvent production) ( Fig. 2). These pathways are usually efficiency indicators of H2 production [49,83]. Generally, glucose undergoes glycolysis to produce pyruvate with NADH as the electron donor. The electrons generated from the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate are transferred to protons and then hydrogenase reduces the protons to molecular H2 gas. In acidogenesis, the production of acetate is normally the preferred pathway in H2 production [26,30,49,84]. The ideal H2 yield is 4mol/mol of hexose via the acetate pathway but it is halved via the butyrate pathway [49,85–87]. It has been reported that a protein-rich substrate favors the acetate pathway but a carbohydrate-rich substrate favors the butyrate pathway [60]. On the other hand, other acidogenesis pathways which produce VFA such as lactate or propionate have been reported to inhibit H2 production [26,49,80]. In contrast to acidogenesis, H2 production in solventogenesis is accompanied by the production of solvents such as ethanol and butanol. However, solventogenesis usually does not encourage high H2 yield because solvents like ethanol has bactericidal effects [49]. During batch fermentation, the switch from the acidogenesis to the solventogenesis pathway triggers the buildup of biogas partial pressure, the accumulation of VFA, and the reduction of fermentative pH [8,49,52,88–90]. The direction of the fermentative pathway directly influences the quality of H2 yield in which the acetate and butyrate pathways are the more favorable directions. Organic acids can act as a supplementary and/or inhibitory factor to H2 production. Productions of acetate and butyrate are usually associated with high H2 production but an accumulation of these acids will negatively impact H2 production ( Fig. 3a). For instance, it has been found that fermentation supplemented with excess butyrate inhibited H2 production from kitchen waste [84] and acetate inhibited H2 production from glycerol [52]. Studies have also shown that the H2 yield from apple pomace was reduced by at least 5% with the addition of acetate and butyrate [41]. In contrast, other organic acids that have been reported as indicators of low H2 production such as lactate and propionate can be potential supplements when present at a threshold concentration [41]. When added to fermentations, lactate and propionate can trigger a positive reaction to induce higher H2 production via the pyruvate pathway (Fig. 3b). For example, it was reported that the addition of lactate at a concentration of 650mg/L enhanced H2 production by up to 37%; and propionate increased H2 yield by 28% [41]. The concentration of organic acids in the fermentation medium regulates H2 production with the control of different feedback mechanisms. 2.3.4.2 Effects of macro- and micronutrients The macronutrients in dark fermentation are carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) and these are usually the essential nutrients [10,16,81,91]. Carbon content is solely contributed by the substrate from which H2 is produced as discussed in Section 2.2. Nitrogen can be in various forms such as protein, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium. The presence of ammonium in fermentation is essential because it does not only serve as a nutrient for bacterial growth but also provides a slight buffering capacity in the medium against the production of organic acids [92,93]. However, it is argued that nitrogen content is not essential because it does not influence the production of total biogas but might affect the lag time of gas production [52]. Phosphorous is usually present in the form of phosphate. Argun et al. [94] showed that the maximum H2 was produced at C/P ratio of 1000 (equivalent to C/N/P of 100/0.5/0.1). Consequently, a balanced nutrient level is essential for optimum H2 production. Metal ions are micronutrients for fermentation. Nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) serve as the co-factors for hydrogenase [95]. Hydrogenase is the main enzyme responsible for H2 production. It is classified according to the metal component in the active site commonly Ni–Fe and Fe–Fe [96,97]. Therefore, fermentation medium supplemented with Ni and Fe enhances H2 production [13,29,98]. It was reported that a fermentation medium supplemented with 0.1mg/L Ni resulted in a 2.4 fold increase in H2 yield compared to non-supplemented fermentations [29], whereas a fermentation medium with increased Fe concentration of 18–55mg/L improved H2 yield by 1.5 fold and shortened the lag phase by 0.33 fold [13]. Other metal ions including zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and chromium (Cr) are also found to be beneficial to other key enzymes including dehydrogenase, dismutase, hydrogenase and methyltransferase [99]. The threshold concentrations of Zn, Cu and Cr are reported as 0.24mg/L, 3.0mg/L and 15mg/L respectively. Once the concentration exceeds the threshold limit, these elements become toxic to HPB. For instance, the yield of H2 was reduced by half when the concentration of Zn, Cu and Cr exceeded the threshold concentration [100]. Additional metal ions at appropriate concentrations can enhance H2 production accordingly by regulating the activity of the enzymes involved in the process. Metal ions can also stabilize H2 production and improve the H2 production processes [15,95]. Calcium (Ca) concentration in the range of 50–150mg/L stabilizes and improves H2 production [13,101,102]. Adding molybdate (Mo) favors the H2 production process because it inhibits sulfate reduction and methane production [98,103]. Niu et al. [15] reported that a low concentration of Mo (0.0042mg/L) could increase H2 yield by 29%. Overall, metal ions assist in obtaining high H2 yield by alleviating fermentation conditions."
5,Conclusion,"The benchmark of H2 production from sludge via dark fermentation is summarized in Table 8. The selection of pretreatment methods determines the variety of HPB preserved in the seed sludge. The activity of HPB is influenced by various fermentation conditions, including type of substrate, fermentation pH and temperature, and types of nutrients, supplements and inhibitors. With the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of these conditions, we can further enhance H2 production via dark fermentation. Hydrogen production from seed sludge via dark fermentation can be a sustainable approach for long term fuel supply. We have presented the importance of sludge enrichment using different pretreatment methods and have revealed that heat pretreatment is the most frequently applied and the most effective method to eliminate HCB while preserving HPB. In addition, the enriched sludge requires optimum fermentation conditions in order to produce H2 optimally through the correct fermentation pathway. However, the current fermentation conditions only enable the enriched sludge to produce up to 2.3molH2/mol glucose via dark fermentation. This is still far from the theoretical value of 4molH2/mol glucose. To further enhance the H2 yield from seed sludge as inoculum, the challenges ahead are to investigate (1) The type of pretreatment methods with appropriate condition and duration that can effectively enrich HPB in seed sludge in order to achieve maximum H2 production; (2) The combination of fermentation conditions that can direct HPB into the correct fermentation pathway for optimum H2 production."
