0,Introduction,"Environmental problems such as the aggravation of global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels motivated several researchers to search for inexhaustible and sustainable energy sources [1]. In addition, these green sources might have their production processes with satisfactory cost and benefit. In this context, hydrogen is shown as a very promising alternative, being called by many authors as the fuel of the future, since it is an ideal energy carrier with a high-energy density of 1600 Wh/kg of tank system weight [2,3]. Besides that, its high energy density (141.86 kJ/g) makes it attractive compared to hydrocarbon-based fuels. In addition, its combustion releases only water as a by-product (H2 + 1/2 O2 → H2O). Finally, hydrogen is also able to generate electricity through fuel cells [4]. Winter [5] discussed the transition of energy source based on the decarbonization and hydrogenation trends, that is, the shift from oil and gas to operationally non-carbon renewables and hydrogen. Trend analysis shows that the continuous shift from solid via liquid to gaseous energy carriers over the last century and a half and a prospective into the 21st century. The relative percentage of the share market of solids (wood, hay and coal) constantly decreased; there will a maximum production for liquids and after it will decline, and gases are on a permanent rise from methane-containing natural gas to hydrogen. Currently, natural gas reform, hydrocarbon oxidation, coal gasification and water electrolysis are the main methods used to produce hydrogen [6]. However, the mentioned methods require high temperatures and pressures for operation, which demands a high amount of energy, besides these processes are of high cost [7]. In contrast, the synthesis of hydrogen via biological processes, which corresponds to only 1% of the total hydrogen production, is a promising alternative because it is performed at room temperature and ambient pressure, representing a reduction in energy consumption and, consequently, favorable energy balances [8]. Microorganisms like algae, cyanobacteria (photobiolysis of water), photosynthetic bacteria (photodecomposition of organic compounds) can produce hydrogen by using renewable sources such as solar energy, biomass or water and fermentative anaerobic bacteria (dark fermentation) degrade organic compounds into hydrogen without light [9]. Among the biological systems for hydrogen production, dark fermentation has been highlighted due to its fast hydrogen conversion rates and the possibility of using different renewable sources as substrate [10–13]. However, this technology has some limitations, such as the large number of by-products (mainly organic acids) generated and, therefore, low hydrogen yields [14,15]. An alternative to minimize the high organic load remaining in the medium of the dark fermentation (in the form of organic acids) and increase the final hydrogen yield is to use a hybrid system, and the most common is the dark fermentation process followed by the photofermentation process [16,17]. In the photofermentation, from organic volatile fatty acids (VFAs), the non-sulfur purple (PNS) bacteria are capable of produce hydrogen in an anoxic environment and in the presence of light [18–20]. In particular, these non-sulfur purple bacteria are able to produce hydrogen efficiently, presenting high theoretical yields of substrate conversion [19]. In addition, the PNS bacteria are also capable of degrading sugars such as glucose, lactose, sucrose and soy molasses to produce hydrogen [20–22]. It is important to note nitrogenase is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the hydrogen formation reaction by PNS bacteria and its performance is improved in the absence of oxygen and nitrogen [20]. The comparison of the three systems (dark fermentation, photofermentation and hybrid) developed by Manish and Banerjee [23], considering sugarcane as substrate, showed that photofermentation and two-stage process required 65% less sugarcane than in dark fermentation process since the hydrogen yields for those processes were higher. Consequently, with the decrease of sugarcane, the electricity expenses during milling stage were also reduced. Moreover, the hybrid system presented the highest reduction in greenhouse gas emission, energy efficiency and net energy ratio (ratio of hydrogen output to the non-renewable energy input). It is evident that this analysis depends on the substrate that is used. Nevertheless, this study proved the importance of improving photofermentation process in order to incorporate it to dark fermentation resulting in an effective and competitive process to overcome conventional methods. Therefore, in the current work the hydrogen production by photofermentation was studied using the non-sulfur purple bacteria Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodopseudomonas palustris in systems of pure culture and co-culture. The effluent from the dark fermentation supplemented with different carbon sources (glucose and milk whey permeate (MWP) were used as substrate. Besides, the type of the carbon source feeding strategy was evaluated, being carbon sources added isolatelly, alternately and simultaneously during photofermentation. The aim of investigating the repeated-batch using different cycles of substrate addition was to extend the duration of the hydrogen production processes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and culture condition,"2.1 Microorganism and culture condition The strains of non-sulfur purple (PNS) bacteria, specifically Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Rhodobacter capsulatus were used in the assays of photofermentation. The PNS bacteria were acquired by German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Culture (DSMZ). The cultivation of photosynthetic bacteria were performed in basal medium RCV [24] and kept in a germination chamber at 30 ± 1 °C under illumination of 30 μmol photons m−2 s−1 by using fluorescent lamps (20 W). Every 10 days, the cells were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was suspended in the fresh culture medium. The fermentable medium used in the photofermentation experiments was the effluent from the dark fermentation by microbial consortium in a UASB reactor, composed by (g/L): 3 KH2PO4, 7 K2HPO4, 1 MgSO4, 3 yeast extract, 0.5 meat extract, 1 (NH4)2SO4, 20 lactose, 0.6 FeSO4, 1.5 (NH4)2SO4 and 1 MgSO4. Lactose was from the milk whey permeate (MWP), acquired from the company of Sooro Concentrado Indústria de Produtos Lácteos Ltda (Brazil). A procedure was followed to make the effluent suitable for the photofermentation experiments. The firstly, the effluent was the centrifuged to remove the biomass (microbial consortium) present in the medium. Subsequently, it was supplemented with the components of the RCV basal medium, except malic acid, ammonium sulfate and thiamine. Ammonium sulfate was not added since ammonia is present in the medium from the dark fermentation. It is important to note the excess of ammonia into the medium would be impracticable as it would increase nitrogen concentration and would lead to inhibition of nitrogenase activity [20]. Thiamine was added after the heat treatment to avoid its degradation. The malic acid was not added since the purpose was to study only the sources of carbon from the organic acids that were present in the effluent and the added sugars. The pH was adjusted to 6.8 with NaOH (1 M) and the fermentable medium was heat-treated in an autoclave (121 °C, 1 atm and 20 min). After cooling to room temperature, thiamine and the PNS bacteria were added as pure culture or as co-culture systems. The co-culture system used in the experiments was composed by R. palustris and R. capsulatus grown in RCV medium, in the proportion 1:1 (v/v)."
3,Photofermentation experiments for hydrogen production,"2.2 Photofermentation experiments for hydrogen production The photofermentation experiments were performed in a 1.5 L bioreactor - Fermenter module TE-2003/1.5-E1. The reaction volume was 700 mL, composed of 65.3 mL of inoculum and 634.7 mL of fermentable medium (from the dark fermentation). The pH of the medium was adjusted and maintained at 6.8 during the process by the addition of NaOH (1 M). The temperature, light intensity and agitation were 32 ± 1 °C, 70 μmol photons m−2 s−1 and 130 rpm, respectively. Argon gas was bubbled in the medium to ensure an anaerobic environment. The monitoring of the photofermentation was performed by the collection of biogas samples and the fermentable medium. Besides, the cell growth, formed metabolites and the sugar consumption were also measured. Experiments evaluated the production of hydrogen from the use of pure culture (R. palustris) and co-culture (R. palustris and R. capsulatus) systems, using glucose and lactose from MWP as sources of sugar. All evaluated conditions used the dark fermentation effluent as substrate. Thus, the following conditions were assessed: - Pure culture system (R. palustris): assays of hydrogen production were carried out using glucose and lactose from MWP, respectively, with concentration of 10 g/L. The sugar (10 g/L) was replenished whenever its total consumption was detected. - Co-culture system (R. palustris and R. capsulatus): analyses of hydrogen production were performed using a co-culture system composed of the bacteria R. palustris and R. capsulatus in a ratio of 1:1 (v/v). In the first mode, the strains were cultured separately in RCV medium and were mixed in the beginning of the photofermentation assay. This mode was studied applying cycles of addition of glucose or MWP. In the second mode, the effect of using the inoculum with the co-cultivated strains, maintained for 7 days prior to the preparation of the experiment, was evaluated as well, thereby creating an acclimated environment, and this acclimated co-culture mode was investigated using only glucose as the sugar source (10 g/L). In all experiments, after inoculation, the co-culture was maintained in the dark fermentation effluent supplemented with glucose or MWP, sugar concentration was adjusted to 10 g/L whenever its depletion was detected in the medium. - Co-culture system (R. palustris and R. capsulatus) with alternating or simultaneous addition of glucose and MWP: the effect of adding two types of sugar to the effluent from dark fermentation was also explored by weither alternating the feeding of the substrate between glucose and MWP (10 g/L of sugar each cycle), or simultaneously feeding glucose and MWP, considering in this case 5 g/L of each sugar."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The composition of the biogas produced was determined using a Shimadzu GC 17A chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and capillary column Carboxen 1010 (length 30 m, internal diameter 0.53 mm). The injector, column and detector temperatures during the analyses were 230 °C, 30 °C and 230 °C, respectively. Argon was used as carrier gas. The quantification of organic acids, ethanol and sugars was obtained by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). A Shimadzu LC-20A Pronience chromatograph was used, equipped with SUPELCOGEL C610H column. The samples were diluted, filtered (0.22 μm porosity) and injected into the equipment. Sugars and ethanol were determined by a refractive index detector and organic acids by an ultraviolet detector at the wavelength of 210 nm. The mobile phase used was a 0.1% (v/v) phosphoric acid solution, the pump flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, the oven temperature was 32 °C and the injection volume was 20 μL. The sample standard deviation was ±0.08 (g/L) for the concentration of organic acids, ethanol and sugars. The cell density was determined by a solution diluted from a sample of reaction medium. The absorbance of the solution was read in a Shimadzu spectrophotometer, at the wavelength of 660 nm and the sample standard deviation was ±0.11 (g/L). The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) was calculated considering the oxidation stoichiometry of the organic compounds (sugars, acids and ethanol), and their concentrations were previously determined by liquid chromatography."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Pure culture system (R. palustris),"3.1 Pure culture system (R. palustris) The aim of the assays with pure culture of R. palustris was to evaluate the effect of the type of sugar used in the repeated-batch cycles for hydrogen production by photofermentation. The initial concentration was 10 g/L of sugar (glucose or lactose from MWP) and the sugar concentration was adjusted after detecting its depletion. The results of hydrogen productivity and concentrations of cells, sugars and metabolites for the assays by cycles of MWP or glucose addition are presented in Fig. 1 (a–f). By the analysis of Fig. 1 (a–f), it was possible to observe that the duration of hydrogen production by R. palustris was 411 h, when lactose from MWP as carbon source was used instead of glucose, 303 h. The assay with MWP resulted in total hydrogen of 0.69 ± 0.02 mol. Maximum productivity of 134.12 ± 4.02 mmol H2/L⋅day in 22 h of process and cell concentration increased 5.5-fold, from 1.43 g/L to 7.92 g/L. When glucose was the sugar, the total amount of hydrogen was 0.51 ± 0.01 mol, maximum productivity was 149.60 ± 1.50 mmol H2/L⋅day in 23 h of photofermentation. In respect to cell concentration, it should be noticed the inoculum concentration was initially lower and varied from 0.83 g/L to 4.65 g/L during 183 h. After that, it decreased to 2.60 g/L at the end of 303 h. Concerning to the relation between cycles of glucose or MWP and hydrogen evolution, the system was reactivated for evolution of biogas in the first additions of sugar. However, to the medium supplemented with glucose, the additions performed at 159 h and 288 h caused no effect in the increase of hydrogen formation. As mentioned, MWP influenced favorably to keep the consortium active producing hydrogen for a longer time. Unlike the assay with glucose, in the medium supplemented with MWP, the production of hydrogen started decreased only after 296 h of assay. Besides the extension of the process, the total volume of biogas was higher with cycles of MWP (9.03 L) than with glucose (6.22 L), respectively. It was corroborated with the superior total number of mol of hydrogen in the assay with MWP. The analysis of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) showed that this parameter increased during the whole process, for both substrates. This can be explained by observing Fig. 1e and f that present the profiles of metabolic concentration produced by photofermentation. In both conditions, there were syntheses of organic acids indicating not complete conversion of sugar in CO2 and H2 as described by Equations (1) and (2) to glucose and lactose [21,25,26] respectively. (1) C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 H2O → 12 H2 + 6 CO2 (2) C12H22O11 (lactose) + 13 H2O → 24 H2 + 12 CO2 Instead of complete conversion, glucose and lactose was consumed to organic acids production as acetic, butyric acids and ethanol. Through these metabolic pathways, hydrogen formation occurred according to Equations (3)–(7) [15,26,27]. (3) C6H12O6 (glucose) + 2 H2O → 2 C2H4O2 (acetic) + 2 CO2 + 4 H2 (4) C6H12O6 (glucose) → C4H8O2 (butyric) + 2 CO2 + 2 H2 (5) C6H12O6 (glucose) + H2O → C2H6O (ethanol) + C2H4O2 (acetic) + 2 CO2 + 2 H2 (6) C12H22O11 (lactose) + 5 H2O → 4 C2H4O2 (acetic) + 4 CO2 + 8 H2 (7) C12H22O11 (lactose) + H2O → 2 C4H8O2 (butyric) + 4 CO2 + 4 H2 In addition to these reactions, the consumption of one type of organic acid may occur to produce other metabolite. Butyric acid, even in small degree, may be converted in acetic acid (Equation (8)). The reduction of lactic acid concentration, in both tests, showed that there was its consumption, mainly, in butyric acid (Equation (9)). Furthermore, lactic acid may also have been converted in acetic acid (Equations (10)–(12)) and propionic acid (Equation (12)) [15]. (8) C4H8O2 (butyric) + 2 H2O → C2H4O2 (acetic) + 2 H2 (9) 2 C3H6O3 (lactic) + 2 H2O → C4H8O2 (butyric) + 2 HCO3 − + H+ + 2 H2 (10) C3H6O3 (lactic) + H2O → C2H4O2 (acetic) + H2 + 2 CO2 (11) C3H6O3 (lactic) + 2 H2O → C2H4O2 (acetic) + HCO3 − + 2 H2 (12) 3 C3H6O3 (lactic) →2 C3H6O2 (propionic) + C2H4O2 (acetic) + HCO3 − + H+ The superior value of COD to the assay with the medium supplemented with MWP was, therefore, due to the longer duration of time of photofermentation that, consequently, allowed the accumulation of metabolites. Specifically to the metabolites, there was production of lactic, butyric, acetic, propionic acids and ethanol. It should be noted the different trend of compounds profile in relation to the sugar added to the medium and, consequently, different final concentrations were observed. For instance, the production of propionic acid was higher than acetic acid in the condition with MWP, indicating that the reaction described by Equation (12) may be dominant over the metabolic routes of acetic acid synthesis. Unlike to assay with MWP, the cycles of glucose resulted in production of acetic acid higher than propionic acid. It suggested that reactions of lactic acid conversion into acetic acid occurred preferably (Equations (9) and (10)). By cycles of glucose, the initial composition of dark fermentation effluent was 5.75 g/L of lactic acid, 0.30 g/L of acetic acid, 0.85 g/L of propionic acid, 1.58 g/L of butyric acid and 1.76 g/L of ethanol. Lactic acid was produced until reaching 24.75 g/L and after 231 h of process, this acid was slightly consumed until its concentration reached 20.82 g/L at 303 h of photofermentation. In some intervals of the assay, butyric acid was also consumed. The final concentration of further metabolites were 0.70 g/L of formic acid, 4.60 g/L of acetic acid, 3.52 g/L of propionic acid, 11.19 g/L of butyric acid and 5.48 g/L de ethanol. The repeated-batch assay with cycles of MWP addition, the initial composition of dark fermentation effluent was lactic acid 0.89 g/L, formic acid 0.15 g/L, acetic acid 1.57 g/L, propionic acid 0.76 g/L and butyric acid 3.20 g/L. In this test, the consumption of lactic acid started at 190 h of process, before the previous assay with addition of glucose, and the concentration of the acid at this point was 24.98 g/L. Moreover, butyric acid was not consumed. The final concentration of the metabolites was 20.11 g/L of lactic acid, 1.99 of formic acid, 6.94 g/L of acetic acid, 11.07 g/L of propionic acid, 23.33 g/L of butyric acid and 1.72 g/L of ethanol. Higher concentrations of acetic acid and butyric acid in this assay in comparison to the process with glucose corroborates the superior production of hydrogen for longer time, since the metabolic pathways for production of these acids lead to simultaneous formation of hydrogen. Thus, the ideal system occurs when there are syntheses of both acids and minimization of production of lactic acid and propionic acid that are related with no hydrogen production or even consumption of produced hydrogen, respectively [12]."
7,Co-culture system (R. palustris and R. capsulatus),"3.2 Co-culture system (R. palustris and R. capsulatus) The co-culture system (Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Rhodobacter capsulatus) was other condition evaluated in this work. Tests were carried out using co-culture inoculum acclimated for a week previously to the assay or adding each strain at the beginning of the photofermentation. Similarly to the assays with pure culture, in each cycle of the repeated-batch, the concentration of glucose and lactose from MWP was adjusted to 10 g/L after sugar depletion was detected. The results of hydrogen productivity and concentrations of cells and sugars for the assays of co-culture by cycles of MWP or glucose addition are presented in Fig. 2 (a–e). By comparing the data from the both systems, pure and co-culture inoculum, it was observed that the effect of sugar was altered. While the assay with pure culture of R. palustris, the longer extension of photofermentation occurred under condition with supplementation of MWP (296 h), the total times of process were 448 h and 679 h in the assays of co-culture with MWP and glucose, respectively. Besides, the duration of assays were longer for the co-culture system and the fact of adapting the co-culture in RCV medium for 7 days prior to the photofermentation led to the shortest duration among the co-culture assays (444 h). With respect to hydrogen production, in the assay with cycles of glucose addition, the amount of hydrogen (0.98 ± 0.02 mol) was higher than the assay with cycles of MWP (0.87 ± 0.03 mol). In the test with the acclimated co-culture, the amount of hydrogen produced was considerably lower (0.36 ± 0.01 mol). In the first assay (co-culture and cycles of glucose), it should be emphasized that 76% of the total biogas (9 L) were produced within the first 119 h of the process that lasted 679 h. The total volume of biogas produced in the second assay of co-culture (cycles of MWP) was 10.35 L and in the test with pre-adapted co-culture (cycles of glucose) was 3.84 L. Despite the volume of biogas was higher in the test with cycles of lactose from MWP, the amount of hydrogen was superior in test with cycles of glucose. In relation to maximum productivity (Fig. 2a), the values were 287.39 ± 5.75 mmol H2/L⋅day in 19 h, 172.07 ± 6.16 mmol H2/L⋅day in 39 h and 59.26 ± 1.19 mmol H2/L⋅day in 119 h, respectively, to the conditions under medium supplementation of glucose, MWP and glucose with acclimated co-culture. Concerning the biomass growth (Fig. 2b), for the assay with addition of glucose, cell concentration increased from 0.93 g/L to 5.18 g/L in 119 h of process and decreased continuously until 3.44 g/L. This fact explains the low production of hydrogen observed after 119 h, whereas no trend was observed in the assay with MWP. Cell concentration increased from 1.09 g/L to 5.85 g/L in the first 46 h, decreased until 4.82 g/L at 133 h and increased again, being 7.44 g/L the mean of cell concentration between 302 h and 448 h of process. In the assay using the acclimated co-culture, the initial cell concentration was 0.81 g/L and in 231 h reached its maximum concentration (4.58 g/L), afterwards a decrease occurs to 3.74 g/L. The low production of hydrogen in the system that used the inoculum as acclimated co-culture prior to the assay may be due to the presence of metabolites produced during the adaptation phase that were transferred to the photofermentation medium and may be toxic to the microorganisms, inhibiting the hydrogen production. By the analysis of Fig. 2 (c–e) it was observed the addition of MWP was done in shorter intervals of time than the assay with glucose. The addition of sugar after a long depletion may have influenced the evolution of hydrogen, what can be noticed by the low increment in hydrogen production after 119 h. The longer interval of glucose addition (343 h–607 h) may also explain the decreased in COD between 486 h and 586 h. For further periods of photofermentation, COD presented the trend of increasing, and as aforementioned, due to conversion of sugar to organic acids and ethanol according to Equations (3)–(7). This can be verified by the profiles of metabolite concentration for the assays of co-culture by cycles of MWP or glucose addition that are shown in Fig. 3 (a–c). In relation to the lactic acid, in these assays of co-culture, the profile of lactic acid concentration depended on its initial content in dark effluent fermentation. For the assays with cycles of glucose, whose initial lactic acid concentration was 21.85 g/L and 10.98 g/L, respectively, acclimated and not acclimated co-culture, there was an initial production followed by consumption in a first phase. In a second phase of the process, lactic acid was produced again. For the assay with cycles of MWP, whose concentration of lactic acid in dark fermentation effluent was less than 1 g/L, the production of lactic acid occurred during the whole photofermentation. In the test of repeated-batch with cycle of glucose and acclimated co-culture, the initial composition of dark fermentation effluent was 21.85 g/L of lactic acid, 2.87 g/L of acetic acid, 0.72 g/L of propionic acid, 0.62 g/L of butyric acid and 4.35 g/L of ethanol. Lactic acid was produced and its concentration attained 25.60 g/L at the end of the assay (444 h). Formic acid was detected, and there were repeated phases of production and consumption, being its final content of 0.14 g/L. Acetic acid was consumed in the first 136 h (1.39 g/L) and, next, it was synthesized to 4.71 g/L at the end of photofermentation. By concerning on the butyric acid, it was initially formed and it was consumed to 18.15 g/L. Ethanol was continuously consumed to 0.88 g/L. In hydrogen production by co-culture using glucose and co-culture prepared just in the moment of inoculating, the profiles of metabolites were similar. Nevertheless, under this condition, there are two steps of production and consumption of lactic acid. The initial composition of the dark fermentation effluent used in this assay was 10.98 g/L of lactic acid, 0.61 g/L of formic acid, 0.73 g/L of acetic acid, 0.12 g/L of propionic acid, 1.59 g/L of butyric acid and 0.69 g/L of ethanol. In the first 47 h, lactic acid was synthesized reaching 21.29 g/L and, next, consumed to 10.72 g/L in 95 h of process. Afterwards, its production occurred and the concentration was 29.33 g/L in 463 h and consumed after this time until attaining 22.13 g/L in 679 h of process. Formic acid was in traces amount being slightly and consecutively formed and consumed, and the final concentration was 0.71 g/L. Acetic acid was synthesized until 417 h, whose concentration was 6.24 g/L, and then, was consumed continuously achieving 4.78 g/L at the end of the assay. There was production of propionic acid until 143 h of process and, from this period of time, its mean concentration was 5.80 g/L. With respect to butyric acid, there was formation obtaining a mean concentration of 14.84 g/L between 110 h and 323 h and, next, it was produced until concentration reaching 20.33 g/L. Ethanol was continuously produced in 200 h of process and, then, its mean content was around 6.39 g/L at the end of assay (679 h). For the system of co-culture using MWP and co-culture prepared just in the moment of inoculating, the initial composition of the dark fermentation effluent was 0.45 g/L lactic acid, 0.33 g/L of acetic acid, 0.39 g/L propionic acid and 1.80 g/L of butyric acid. Different from both assays with cycles of glucose, the metabolites were continuously produced in the assay with MWP. The final concentrations (448 h) were in g/L, 24.06; 2.68; 4.97; 6.76; 24.80 and 0.50 of lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and ethanol, respectively. The high content of lactic acid may be inhibited the co-culture and, then, the extension of this photofermentation was shorter than the assay with glucose. However, the number of mol of hydrogen was only slightly inferior (0.87 ± 0.03 mol) than the number obtained when glucose was used (0.98 ± 0.02 mol). In both assays, the dominant metabolic pathway was the butyric acid production and this is a route that leads to hydrogen evolution (Equations (4) and (7))."
8,Co-culture system (R. palustris and R. capsulatus) with alternated addition or simultaneous addition of glucose and lactose from MWP,"3.3 Co-culture system (R. palustris and R. capsulatus) with alternated addition or simultaneous addition of glucose and lactose from MWP The co-culture system was also carried out to investigate the effect of cycles of both sugars (glucose and lactose from MWP). In this step, the repeated-batch was performed by alternately adding MWP and glucose, since this alternative system successfully extended the duration of the bioreactor kept active in hydrogen production by Rhodobacter capsulatus [30]. In addition, in the current work, cycles with simultaneous addition of both carbon sources (1:1/glucose:MWP) were also used. The results of hydrogen productivity, cell concentration, sugar concentration and metabolites concentration for both tests are presented in Fig. 4 (a–f). The repeated-batch with alternated cycles of MWP and glucose provided better results in relation to the amount of hydrogen produced in comparison to previous conditions (cycles of only one type of carbon source, with pure or co-culture systems). The total number of mol was 1.41 ± 0.01 mol and maximum productivity was 266.60 ± 5.33 mmol H2/L⋅day in 25 h. The whole photofermentation lasted 400 h, lesser than in the co-culture assay with cycles of addition of either MWP or glucose. Moreover, in the condition with alternated cycles, the cell concentration increased from 0.23 g/L to 2.12 g/L, corresponding to an increment of 9.22-fold and biogas was 9.96 L. The results of the system with simultaneous addition were lower than those obtained in the assay with alternated cycles. Maximum productivity was 147.75 ± 4.43 mmol H2/L⋅day in 111 h, total number of H2 mol was 0.68 ± 0.04 mol, volume of biogas was 6.2 L and cell concentration presented an increment of 0.24-fold, varying from 1.93 g/L, reached a maximum around 225 h and 250 h and decreased to 1.74 g/L. The duration of photofermentation was 280 h, shorter than all conditions evaluated in this work. In relation to COD, similarly to previous assays, this parameter increased during the process due to the conversion to an organic form (sugar) to another (organic acids and ethanol). Concerning the metabolites, for the condition of alternated cycles, the lactic acid concentration was initially 0.38/L and increased to 23.08 g/L in 144 h, being consumed to 1.35 g/L in 240 h and, then, it reached a concentration of 15.45 g/L at the end of the process (400 h). Formic acid was not present in the dark fermentation effluent and it was produced to 1.54 g/L. The concentration of acetic acid in the dark fermentation effluent was 0.54 g/L and it was formed and consumed repeatedly throughout the process, varying from 1.80 to 3.30 g/L, its content attained 3.45 g/L in 400 h. Under this condition, differently from the other assays with addition of only one source of carbon, propionic acid was produced in higher concentration and presented a mean content of 10.46 g/L from 263 h to the end of the assay. The production of propionic acid must be avoided, since this metabolic pathway leads to the consumption of hydrogen as shown in Equation (13). Nevertheless, even with this concentration of propionic acid, hydrogen production was still high due to the metabolic route of butyric acid was dominant and its final concentration was 25.10 g/L in 400 h. (13) C6H12O6 (glucose) + 2 H2 → 2 C3H6CO2 (propionic) + 2 H2O Ethanol was not detected in the dark fermentation effluent and it was synthesized in traces amount and, next, consumed, and its final concentration was neglected. Dominant production of butyric acid was also observed in the assay with simultaneous addition of MWP and glucose. However, the final concentration was only 15.62 g/L in 280 h, end of process. Lactic acid was formed from 2.99 g/L to 5.05 g/L in 111 h. After that, it was consumed to 0.75 g/L in 168 h and, then, produced to a final concentration of 14.97 g/L. It was not detected formic acid and ethanol in this assay. The concentration of acetic acid was initially 1.33 g/L, increased to 3.20 g/L in 168 h, and after, it was consumed to a final concentration of 1.57 g/L. Initial concentration of propionic acid was 0.27 g/L. It reached 3.84 g/L at the end of the process, presenting a maximum amount of 4.59 g/L in 168 h of photofermentation. The low productivity and duration of process indicates that the co-culture did not well adapt to cycles of MWP and glucose simultaneously added. Based on the results obtained in the current work, co-culture system (R. palustris and R. capsulatus) resulted in higher production of hydrogen than under pure culture system. For the co-culture conditions in which glucose was the supplemented sugar, the evolution of hydrogen occurred promptly in the first 119 h and, then, reached stability. By using MWP, this stability was achieved in 300 h of process. For the cycles with alternated or simultaneous additions of MWP and glucose, the trend was similar to co-culture with cycles of MWP. The highest amount of hydrogen was obtained by adding alternately the lactose from MWP and glucose (1.41 ± 0.01 mol) and the lowest was detected using cycles with simultaneous addition (0.68 ± 0.04 mol). It suggests that sugars such as glucose and MWP were used singly to produce hydrogen by co-culture of photosynthetic bacteria; however, conditions in which sugars were added at the same time, a carbon catabolite repression can reduce the evolution of the target-product. In addition, a higher consumption of sugar may have caused the production of metabolites that, gradually, made the medium to become toxic to the co-culture for the formation of hydrogen. On the other hand, the repression of carbohydrate utilization genes ensures that a minimal set of genes be expressed to obtain a certain amount of metabolites. Also, if only one carbon source is available, the carbohydrate metabolism acts as an auto-regulatory device to limit carbohydrate consumption [28]. Nevertheless, the productivity with alternated addition decreased less sharply and reached the final process with a productivity of 122.48 ± 6.12 mmol H2/L⋅day, whereas the assays of cycles with addition of only glucose, only MWP and both substrate simultaneously resulted in final productivity of 51.12 ± 2.04, 66.78 ± 4.01 and 83.32 ± 4.17 mmol H2/L·day, respectively. The assay of cycles with simultaneous addition presented a different profile of productivity in comparison to the further assays, considering co-culture prepared just in the moment of inoculating. Under this condition, the hydrogen productivity increased promptly and was kept constant from 30 to 150 h, around the maximum value, and, then, began to decay. Concerning the cell growth, similar profile was observed to co-culture using both substrates, alternately or simultaneously. Besides, the same was also verified to the assay with addition of only MWP. In general, the cell concentration increased in the first 220 h and, afterwards, it was maintained constant to the end of the photofermentation. By adding only glucose, the lower cell concentration may have contributed to less production of toxic metabolic to the microorganisms. Therefore, the process presented the longest extension. By analyzing the composition of the metabolites, butyric acid was formed in higher concentrations in all conditions, reaching contents superior to 20 g/L to assays with cycles of only glucose, only MWP or alternated addition of both. The pathway routes resulted in high production of hydrogen, according to Equations (4) and (7). A second metabolic that was also produced in considerable amount was lactic acid. However, the stoichiometric relation to hydrogen production from lactic acid is no favorable. Furthermore, production of acetic acid also leads to hydrogen production (Equations (3) and (5)). However, its content was less than 6.5 g/L in general. Therefore, acetic acid production under cycles of glucose corroborates to a longer extension of this assay. For propionic acid, higher concentration (10 g/L) was observed in the alternated addition of glucose and MWP. This fact may explain the interruption of hydrogen in shorter duration, since propionic acid is inhibitor of hydrogen production. In addition, formic acid that was not observed into the dark effluent was produced and reached 1.54 g/L. Further, ethanol was produced in low amounts and followed consume. Previous investigation performed and published by Silva et al. (2016) studied the repeated-batch cycles operation by alternating the type of sugar (lactose and glucose). These authors reported that controlling the residual amount of sugar, bacteria inhibition was avoided; lactic acid, that was toxic to the biomass, was consumed and the metabolic route of butyric acid production was predominant. Under optimum conditions, the maximum H2 productivity reached 208.40 mmol H2/L·day in 52 h. Besides the author aforementioned it is important to emphasize the hybrid system is an instrument promising to reach increases on the hydrogen yield [30]. In addition, the use of co-culture system using photosynthetic bacteria strains can contribute providing relevant information since the literature is scarce on the subject. From the results illustrated, it was possible to conclude the mode of feeding sugars in the fermentation processes has effects on the target product (hydrogen) synthesis. It is known each bacterium has its owner enzymes that enable it to use simple or complex carbohydrates. The key to obtain long run in hydrogen standards is the learning of the mixed bacteria metabolism. The presence or absence of essential carbon sources associated with the repeated-batch in an isolated or alternating manner suggested increase or inhibition in genes involved in the global regulation of fermentative hydrogen production. Based on the results of this current work, some common tendencies were observed as the increase in hydrogen production related to production of butiric acid or its decrease related to lactic acid synthesis. After a certain period of fermentation, hydrogen evolution ceased in all tested conditions, most probably due to intoxication of microorganisms by the metabolites present in the medium. In this current work, the only metabolites identified were ethanol and organic acids (butiric, acetic, propionic and lactic). Nevertheless, it is know that phenolic compounds and superior alcohols may be produced, within others that can inhibit metabolism and growth of PNS. This trends occurred in all assays independently of the type of carbon source or the strategy that substrate was fed into the medium. Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the composition of the medium as a whole, since the learning of the process and gene expression may be provide more detailed understanding of the mechanisms in which hydrogen is produced by a co-culture system using hybrid condition (dark and photofermentation). This has been in consideration in the project under development as a continuation of this current work. A comparison with the literature showed that the results of the present work is optimistic in relation to the use of milk whey permeate as substrate, co-culture PNS photofermentation and alternated fed strategy, especially in keeping the activity of the culture. Although, the longest extension (679 h) was obtained in co-culture with addition of only glucose by feeding the medium alternately with glucose and MWP. It resulted in maximum productivity of 266.60 ± 5.33 mmol H2/L⋅day and cumulative hydrogen gas of 1.41 ± 0.01 mol. Morsy [29] investigated the hydrogen production by mixed dark and photo-fermentative hydrogen producing bacteria Escherichia coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides from sorghum grains crude starch. Higher efficiency was reached by using mixed R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides than using each strain in the combined dark and photofermentation. The reason is the varying efficiencies of both strains in converting various volatile fatty acids produced by dark fermentation into hydrogen gas. Their optimum result was maximum productivity of 432 mmol H2/L⋅day, but the duration was only 80 h with a cumulative hydrogen gas of 0.25 mol. Using pure culture (Rhodobacter capsulatus) in hydrogen production [30], succeeded to achieve maximum productivity 208.40 mmol H2/L⋅day in 52 h, and a long extension of fermentation, superior to 800 h. Androga et al. [31] evaluated long-term stability of biomass and hydrogen production on acetate by Rhodobacter capsulatus YO3 (hup−) in outdoor fermentation. They obtained a productivity of 12.24 mmol mmol H2/L⋅day and a molar hydrogen yield of 53% for a period of 60 days."
9,Conclusions,"The results showed that it is possible and with great potential the use of photofermentation for the production of hydrogen from the effluent from the dark fermentation and the use of PNS bacteria. On the other hand, high organic acid concentrations were observed mainly to lactic and butyric acids. In particular, tests which the co-culture system was used, with the strains inoculated at the time of the test, presented promising results. Besides, MWP seemed to stimulate the metabolic activity of the bacteria. However, in the co-culture system glucose was more effective in the H2 production. For the tests cited, maximum yields of 287.39 ± 5.75 mmol H2/L·day, 172.07 ± 6.16 mmol H2/L·day, 266.60 ± 5.33 mmol H2/L·day, and 147.75 ± 4.43 mmol H2/L·day for assays with glucose cycles, MWP cycles, alternating feed of both sugars and simultaneous feed, respectively were verified."
