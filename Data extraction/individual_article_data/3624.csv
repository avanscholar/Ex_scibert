0,Introduction,"Switching to hydrogen (H2) as an alternative energy carrier for energy production could alleviate many environmental concerns related to the combustion of fossil fuels [1]. It is well established that fuel cells can achieve higher overall efficiencies than the internal combustion engine (ICE) [2]. Hence, the strong interest in the use of H2 has led to the search of various methods to deliver H2 in a safe and convenient way. However, the practical engineering issues of H2 production, distribution, compression, safety and public acceptance, limit the large scale adoption of a H2 economy. Liquid alcohols could serve as a bridge between gasoline and gaseous H2. They possess high energy densities and can be easily stored and distributed through the existing gasoline infrastructure. It has also been argued that alcohols are the next liquid fuels to use after the depletion of petroleum resources [3]. Methanol (CH3OH) is a readily-available electroactive alcohol which can be economically mass-produced from non-renewable resources such as natural gas, coal, or from renewable resources such as biomass. Alcohols can be used to produce electricity in direct fuel cells or mechanical energy in internal combustion engines. However, an alcohol electrochemical reformer or electrolyser can be used to produce clean H2 which can be used in other sytems, resulting in an improvement in the overall system performance. Electrochemical reforming or electrolysis is a process in which an organic or alcohol fuel is electro-oxidized to form H2. Electrical power is required to split the chemically-bonded species. As shown in Fig. 1 , an electrochemical reformer or electrolyser can consist of two electrodes separated by a proton exchange membrane, which form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The aqueous solution of CH3OH fed to the anode is electro-oxidized via a dehydrogenation process to produce carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen ions (H+) and electrons (e−). The electrochemical reactions and standard potentials are as follows: (1) Anode reaction:CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 6 H + + 6 e − E a o = 0.016 V vs . SHE (2) Cathode reaction: 6 H + + 6 e − → 3 H 2 E c o = 0 V vs . SHE (3) Overall reaction:CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 3 H 2 E o = 0.016 V Most H2 is currently produced by the well-established catalytic steam reforming (SR) process for hydrocarbon-based fuels, which requires higher temperatures in the range of 250–1100°C. It can be carried out externally, integrated with a fuel cell, or directly inside a fuel cell such as a molten-carbonate fuel cell (MCFC, 600–700°C) or a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC, 600–1000°C). On-board gasoline reforming was originally believed to be the best way of generating H2 for transportation but it was determined that it did not offer clear advantages over other available technologies, such as gasoline ICE and battery hybrids [4]. The practical issues of durability, size and weight, resistance to vibration, cold-start, transient response, and H2 purity concerns, complicates the application of SR for H2 generation in transportation. An important approach to achieve the ultimate performance targets, including start-up time and start-up energy, could be to efficiently carry out on-board reforming at temperatures lower than that of a conventional SR. It was reported that methanol catalytic reforming can be carried out in the aqueous phase at lower temperatures (80–200°C) [5–8]. It seems that no studies have verified if low temperature methanol reforming could meet the on-board fuel processing targets and if its adoption could serve as a bridge towards the implementation of a H2 economy. Under certain operating conditions, the alcohol electrochemical reformer or electrolyser may result in reduced energy consumption over comparable existing technologies. First, the single-step electrochemical reforming process could be conducted in the liquid phase at a lower operating temperature and has the potential to have a higher overall system efficiency compared to conventional high-temperature multi-reactor SR systems. Secondly, H2 production from methanol electrolysis should result in lower power consumption than H2 production from water electrolysis, the large scale commercialization of which is restrained by its significant electricity requirements. In fact, the standard potential for the oxidation of CH3OH in the liquid phase is only −0.016V versus the standard H2 electrode (SHE) compared to −1.23V vs. SHE for the oxidation of water. It has been estimated that H2 production from the electrolysis of CH3OH costs about 50% less compared to that of water, even when the cost of CH3OH is taken into account [9]. Furthermore, the prompt start-up and shut-down time of the PEM electrolysers and their ease of scalability to compact, light and simple systems render them appropriate to generate pure H2 for portable and distributed applications. The main disadvantages of alcohol electrolysis are issues also faced by direct alcohol fuel cells: the slow kinetics of the anode alcohol electro-oxidation and the loss of fuel resulting from the alcohol and water cross-over from the anode to the cathode. Although CO2, a greenhouse gas, is produced whether CH3OH is thermally or electrochemically reformed, it is more localized and concentrated in an electrochemical reforming process. This has an advantage for effective capture for sequestration and reduces the cost for CO2 disposal in many applications. The cost of CO2 capture and disposal for various coal-fired generation technologies ranges from 1.1 to 4.9cent/kWhe and 0.6 to 6.7cent/kWhe, respectively [10]. It appears that no journal articles were published on the electrochemical reforming or electrolysis of alcohols until 2007, there has been some prior activity on this topic in the patent literature. Reichman and William demonstrated the electrochemical production of H2 gas from CH3OH in aqueous NaOH or KOH media at temperatures between 23 and 60°C [11]. The inclusion of a base permits the generation of H2 without CO2 emission. As H2 would be the only gas produced, it would not require separation from other gaseous by-products and single chamber configurations might be possible. However, in a dual-chamber configuration, the bicarbonate ions and/or carbonate ions generated as soluble by-products might degrade the performance of the electrolyser. For this reason, in the current dual-chamber PEM electrolysis study, the electrochemical reforming was carried out in acidic media. Teruo et al. efficiently produced H2 by the electrochemical decomposition of an aqueous solution of liquid fuel via electrolysis in a two-chamber electrolytic cell using a diaphragm and metals dispersed on carbon as the anode and cathode catalysts [12]. Woods et al. [13] developed an electrochemical reformer and fuel cell system which uses a solid-state or liquid state acidic or basic electrolyte and relies on electricity and/or thermal energy to supply the necessary reaction energy to reform organic fuels into H2 and CO2, while the H2 generated produces electricity in a fuel cell. Takayuki et al. [14] described a system to electrochemically decompose CH3OH to H2 which was then used in an integrated PEMFC unit. A static electrochemical process to reform an aqueous CH3OH solution at temperatures between 50 and 100°C and at a cell voltage between 300 and 500mV was developed by Busenhender et al. [15]. It used a polymeric proton-conducting membrane, Pt or Pt/Ru catalysts at the anode, a Pd layer at the cathode, and a Pd–Ag foil was hot-pressed on the cathode polymer side of the membrane to prevent water and methanol cross-over. Lastly, the more recent patent by Narayanan et al. [9] focuses on H2 production by electrolysis of organic fuel and water circulating solutions using a wide range of membrane electrode assemblies. Using the preferred configuration which includes Nafion®, Toray™ paper, 1–4mg/cm2 supported or unsupported catalyst loadings of Pt–Ru at the anode and Pt at the cathode, unacidified CH3OH aqueous solutions from 0.1 to 8M and temperatures from 5 to 120°C, it was shown that current densities as high as 800mA/cm2 could be sustained at −0.5V. A purification system to clean the H2 generated and remove fuel which has crossed over to the cathode was also included, as well as coupling with a solar-cell-based electricity generation unit. However, no specific information on the operation configuration details and cell design is given. To date, all literature published studies pertaining to the performance of alcohol electrolysers have been carried out in a recycle operation mode [16,17] or flowing mode [18]. In these studies, the anode is fed with unacidified CH3OH aqueous solution, which is fed using a pump, while the cathode compartment containing H2 is purged with argon. In the recycle operation studies, carbon paper, which has a diffusion layer composed of polytetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) and carbon on its surface, is employed as current collector, and Nafion® 117 is used as the electrolyte. Typical anode catalysts used are Pt/C or Pt–Ru/C, and although Pt/C is typically the most studied cathode catalyst, cathode catalysts such as Pt–WC/C have also been investigated [16]. In this paper, we report results obtained for the electrolysis of aqueous acidic CH3OH solutions using a two-compartment electrolytic glass cell in the static mode for the first time. This cell configuration allowed measurements of the anodic and cathodic potential contributions to the overall cell voltage. In this study, most tests were conducted with 0.5M H2SO4 in the cathode compartment but the effect of having a dry N2 purge cathode was also investigated. The characteristics of the methanol–water–sulphuric acid electrolysis are described and compared to that of the water–sulphuric acid electrolysis under the same conditions. MEAs were prepared using different supported and unsupported conventional fuel cell catalysts and their electrocatalytic behaviour towards water and methanol electrolysis was evaluated over a range of methanol concentrations and different temperatures."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and MEA preparation,"2.1 Materials and MEA preparation Certified electronic grade CH3OH, and American Chemical Society (ACS) certified plus H2SO4, both from Fisher Scientific, were used with DI water having a resistivity of 18MΩcm to make up the solutions. The H2O associated with H2SO4 was taken into account when making the CH3OH solutions. Behmann et al. [19] stated that the addition of CH3OH to H2SO4 +H2O mixtures containing less than 18M H2SO4 had no influence on the ternary mixture, and had dissociation behaviour is similar to that of the H2SO4 +H2O binary system. Hence the dissociation behaviour of H2SO4 will be the same for all the aqueous acidic CH3OH solution concentration used in this study. Ultra high-purity H2 and N2 gases from Praxair were used in some tests. A supporting electrolyte concentration of 0.5M H2SO4 was used in the anode and cathode cell compartments. Nafion® 117 (Ion Power Inc.), was selected as the solid polymer proton exchange membrane. Conditioning was conducted by first boiling the membrane in a solution of 3wt% H2O2 (certified, Fisher Scientific), for 30min, then boiling it in deionised (DI) water for 30min and finally, boiling it in 0.5M H2SO4 for 30min. It was rinsed with DI between each boiling step and then cut to shape and stored in DI water until used. Toray™ carbon paper, TGPH-060, with 20wt% Teflon® (PTFE) wet-proofing from BASF Fuel Cell Inc., was used as the gas diffusion layer (GDL). A micro-porous layer (MPL) consisting of a 1mg/cm2 coating composed of carbon black and 20wt% PTFE was sprayed on top of the cathode GDL surface, to form a double-layer gas diffusion layer. No MPL was used on the anode side. Conventional alcohol fuel cell noble metal electrocatalysts were employed: 20wt% HP Pt supported on Vulcan XC-72 and 20wt% HP Pt:Ru alloy (1:1 a/o) supported on Vulcan XC-72, both from E-TEK, Pt black (99.9+%, fuel cell grade) and Ru black (99.9%) both from Sigma Aldrich, and Pt:Ru alloy (1:1 a/o) from Alfa Aesar. The Pt–Ru catalyst loading was 4mg/cm2 while the Pt loading was 2mg/cm2. The catalyst inks were composed of the supported catalyst powder, a proton conductive ionomer in solution (30wt% Nafion®), water and isopropanol. Catalyst inks were prepared and sprayed with an Accuspray® air gun (Model 07HS, ISAAC Series HVLP Spray), on one side of the GDL, forming a gas diffusion electrode (GDE). A planar Pt disk (0.25mm, 99.99+% Pt foil, Goodfellow Cambridge Limited) of a 2.01cm2 area was used as an anode catalyst in some experiments for comparison purposes. The current collectors were made from an annealed 0.25mm thick Nb foil, 99.9% pure from Sigma–Aldrich."
3,Electrochemical glass cell,"2.2 Electrochemical glass cell All experiments were conducted in a dual-chamber borosilicate glass (Pyrex) cell composed of two chambers as shown in Fig. 2 , which was built by CanSci Glass Products Ltd. Various ports permitted the inclusion of reference electrodes, thermocouples, gas evolution-inverted 10mL burettes, and gas spargers or bubblers in the anode or cathode compartments. Slight internal bevels were provided in the upper part of the anode and cathode compartments to facilitate the gas exit. The CO2 gas forming at the anode and H2 gas forming at the cathode were vented in all experiments. The MEA holder was machined in polyetherimide (ULTEM 1000) by Core Tools Ltd. Its central opening had a circular active geometric area of 2cm2. The MEA holder contained different layers: the membrane electrode assembly, the current collectors, two silicon sealing rings and a PTFE spacer ring. A 25mm diameter membrane coupon was sandwiched between the anodic and cathodic 16mm diameter GDE coupons. Two niobium current collectors (25mm OD, 16mm ID), having a thin current collecting metal cross through their circular openings were placed on each side of the MEA. Silicone seal rings (25mm OD, 16mm ID, 1mm thickness) made in house were placed on each side of the current collectors. Finally, a PTFE spacer ring (54273 AMG06, 25mm OD, 16mm ID, 1mm thickness) was placed as the last layer on the cathode side to provide adequate volume for compression. The glass cell, MEA holder and O-rings were joined and held together using a screw clamping apparatus. It was designed to press the thick flat ends of the glass cell compartments together and ensured alignment of the glass compartments. This permitted the application of a uniformly distributed force to seal the glass cell flanges to the MEA holder O-rings. All experiments carried out at room temperature were conducted in ambient air (23°C±2°C). For experiments at 50 and 75°C±1°C water was circulated within the double wall of the glass cell and the temperature controlled by a Haake DC-30 immersion circulator. Thermocouples were used to monitor the temperature in each of the glass cell compartments."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were carried out at steady-state using a multistat (Solartron Analytical, Model 1470E) connected to a computer, using CoreWare software. A single junction mercury–mercurous sulphate (MSE, Hg/Hg2SO4, Radiometer Analytical) reference electrode was used for all experiments at ambient temperature. At 50 and 75°C, a double junction silver/silver chloride (SSE, Ag/AgCl, Radiometer Analytical) reference electrode was used, with 0.5M H2SO4 in its outer compartment. The reference electrode was placed in the anode compartment. All voltages are reported versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). All electrolysis experiments were conducted in the galvanostatic, current-controlled mode. AC impedance measurements were carried out with an impedance/gain phase analyzer (Solartron Analytical, Model 1260A) to obtain the MEA and solution resistance. Measurements were performed with an AC amplitude of 10mV, in the frequency range of 10−3–107 Hz. All measured potential values were corrected for the ohmic drop before kinetic parameter information was extracted. Using this technique, it was confirmed that the MEA resistance increased with increasing CH3OH concentration, MEA usage and electrode degradation due to carbon oxidation."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization Cyclic voltammetric techniques were used to determine the true active surface area of the catalysts in a conventional three electrode single chamber electrochemical cell. The active surface area of the Pt catalysts was estimated from the H2 adsorption charge on the cyclic voltammograms [20], while that of Pt–Ru catalysts was estimated by the copper under potential deposition method [21,22]. The average true active surface areas obtained for the different catalysts are summarized in Table 1 and were later used in the estimation of kinetic parameters. These techniques were also used to confirm that the catalyst electrochemical area decreases with increasing utilization and carbon oxidation of the catalyst support."

7,Thermodynamic evaluation of methanol reforming at low temperatures,"3.1 Thermodynamic evaluation of methanol reforming at low temperatures A theoretical thermodynamic analysis was carried out for a direct methanol reformer (DMR) in acidic media and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer as a function of temperature. The effect of pressure on the theoretical cell voltage and thermodynamic efficiency was found to be negligible compared to the effect of temperature, and hence is not discussed here. The thermodynamic information for the species involved, including the standard Gibbs free energy ( Δ G f o ), the standard enthalpy ( Δ H f o ), the standard enthalpy of combustion or calorific value of the fuel ( Δ H c o ) and the heat capacity (Cp 298), are available in the literature [23,24]. These values, from which the standard entropy of reaction (ΔS o) was calculated, were used to establish the theoretical cell voltage (E cell,T,P) and theoretical thermodynamic efficiency (η max). An example of the thermodynamic calculations for the DMR electrochemical reactions in the vapour phase is provided. The Gibbs free energy associated with the electrochemical reaction is given by: (4) Δ G o = ∑ i s i Δ G i , f o ( products − reactants ) The standard cell voltage or reversible cell potential, E o, is given by: (5) E o = − Δ G o n F The enthalpy of reaction can be calculated by: (6) Δ H o = ∑ i s i Δ H i , f o The entropy of reaction can be determined from the Maxwell equation from thermodynamics, assuming that the entropy of reaction is constant over the temperature range and is independent of pressure: (7) Δ S f o = ( Δ H o − Δ G o ) 298 The change in entropy is less than 1% between 76 and 150°C when correcting for the change in heat capacity with temperature. The change in cell voltage with temperature can then be approximated by: (8) E cell , T = E o + ( T − 298 ) · ( Δ S f o n F ) The maximum thermodynamic efficiency can be calculated, assuming that the Δ H c T value is independent of pressure, but corrected for the temperature using the heat capacity for the species involved. The enthalpy of combustion of gaseous CH3OH at 100°C is calculated using the lower heating value (LHV): (9) ( ∂ Δ H c T ∂ T ) P = Δ C p o = Constant At 100°C and 1atm: (10) η max = ( − n F E cell , T , P Δ H c T ) · 100 These theoretical calculations assume that there is no vapour forming before the fuel boiling point and that there is no liquid present after the fuel boiling point is reached. The boiling point of the methanol-water mixture will change depending on the concentration. For the DMR thermodynamic calculations an equimolar mixture of water and methanol which has a boiling point of 76.7°C was assumed. The effect of the electrolyte is also ignored. The CO2 released at the anode of the DMR is assumed to be in the gas phase at all temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3 , the thermodynamic efficiency and theoretical cell voltage both increase with increasing temperature. The PEM water electrolyser has a very low theoretical thermodynamic efficiency and theoretical cell voltage compared to the DMR system. The low theoretical thermodynamic efficiencies determined for the DMR and PEM water electrolyzer reflect the fact that the maximum theoretical efficiency of a power source (fuel cell) is the reverse of that of a power sink (electrolyzer). The negative theoretical thermodynamic efficiency values obtained indicate that, at this temperature, energy needs to be supplied to these systems to make them thermodynamically favourable. The amount of electrical energy required is equal to the Gibbs free energy of the electrochemical reaction plus the losses in the system. It was determined that the DMR theoretical thermodynamic efficiency and theoretical cell voltage become positive at a temperature of about 48°C, respectively. Hence, according to thermodynamics at temperatures greater than 50°C, the DMR should be a source of electricity, as well as H2 at temperatures greater than 50°C. However, favourable reaction thermodynamics do not imply that the electrochemical reaction is kinetically favourable. The theoretical thermodynamic efficiency and theoretical cell voltage of the PEM water electrolyser, on the other hand, do not become positive over the temperature range investigated, i.e., up to 150°C. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates which electrochemical reactions can occur spontaneously at specific conditions, but does not provide any kinetic information about the electrochemical reactions."
8,Electrolysis polarizations,"3.2 Electrolysis polarizations 3.2.1 Cell voltage stability Typical responses obtained for different current densities are shown in Fig. 4 . At lower current densities, steady-state was rapidly reached and the potential stabilized where the CH3OH oxidation could be run at a reasonable efficiency. At high current densities, the CH3OH oxidation current alone was insufficient to sustain the high current density resulting in the voltage dropping off and other undesirable side-reaction starting to occur. Water electrolysis starts to occur at voltages below −1.23V vs. SHE, and carbon oxidation, e.g., the anode oxidation catalyst support starts to oxidize at a cell voltage of about −1.8V vs. SHE. Hence, a limiting current density is reached for the electro-oxidation of CH3OH beyond which no stable cell voltage measurements could be obtained. Although the experiments were done in the static mode, this effect has been observed for CH3OH electrolysis in the active mode [18]. Voltage measurements were recorded at current densities where steady-state was reached, i.e., when the change in cell potential was less than 20mV over five minutes. The region of cell voltage stability varied as a function of current density, CH3OH concentration, temperature and the type of anode electrocatalyst. In the limiting current density region, steady-state could not be reached. Fig. 5 shows an example of the tests repeatability in the different regions. In the stable region, the electrolysis polarization curve is very reproducible. The experiments conducted in the forward direction, from small current densities to large current densities, in the backward direction, from large current densities to small current densities, and in a random order of current densities all resulted in very similar voltages at a particular current density. When the test was started backward from a point in the unstable region, the results were still reproducible, but the error for the first data point in the stable region was slightly larger. When the test was started at a current density where the safety limit of −4V was reached, irreversible damage was observed as the catalyst was oxidized and precious metal was lost from its surface. This was also verified by conducting cyclic voltammetric experiments on fresh, used and oxidized supported catalyst coupons. The data points shown in the figures represent the arithmetic average of values obtained for a minimum of three different samples. The calculated standard deviation, representing the upper and lower limits, was typically in the range of 10mV but closer to 200mV in the limiting current region. In the limiting current density region, voltage values were unstable and were empirically obtained by linear interpolation between the last stable data points and the safety limit, which was set at −4V. 3.2.2 Effect of methanol concentration and anode catalyst In order to investigate the effect of CH3OH concentration on the polarization curve, the anode compartment CH3OH concentration was varied from 0 to 16M (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 6, 16M), with 0M representing water electrolysis. Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the cell voltage corrected for the ohmic losses on the current density for different CH3OH concentrations and represent typical electrolysis polarization curves. They show open-circuit voltages (OCV) less than the equilibrium cell voltage likely due to fuel cross-over; activation control at lower current densities resulting in a sharp initial decrease in cell voltage as the current density increases; a subsequent linear slow voltage decrease with current density due to ohmic control followed by a rapid decrease in cell voltage due to mass transport limitations. The limiting current densities, i L, are reached in the transport control region when the fuel is used at a rate equal to its maximum transport supply rate. At the limiting current density voltages were reached where other competing reactions can occur such as water electrolysis and/or carbon oxidation. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the i L value varied with CH3OH concentration. At low current densities (<12mA/cm2), the CH3OH concentration did not impact the cell voltage significantly, while at higher current densities, lower overpotentials were obtained at higher CH3OH concentrations. As expected, for CH3OH oxidation the required electrolytic voltages were significantly less than for water electrolysis at the same current density. In contrast with active CH3OH electrolysis studies where the anode reactants are continuously flowing, the static system electrolytic polarizations are more sensitive to CH3OH concentration. Hu et al. [16] showed how the electrolysis performance was not dependent on the CH3OH concentration at concentrations greater than 2M at 60°C, but the concentration polarization was obvious at high current densities for concentrations lower than 1M. In another study, by Shen at al. [17], the voltage losses for CH3OH electrolysis were reported to be almost the same in the 2–4M range, while the voltage losses were greater at concentrations lower or higher than this range. At low CH3OH concentrations, high current densities could not be sustained. At high CH3OH concentrations, less voltage was required to hold the same current densities and higher current densities could be sustained. Methanol permeation from the anode compartment to the cathode compartment increased with increasing CH3OH concentrations. Methanol permeation will decrease fuel efficiency. However, in the system under study, CH3OH present in the cathode compartment can not be oxidized at the reducing cathode voltages observed during electrolysis. In their study, Hu et al. attributed the poor electrolysis performance at high CH3OH concentration to the creation of a mixed potential at the cathode which in turn reduced its electrocatalytic activity. Other phenomena such as adsorption and catalyst site blockage were not considered but are possible. As the data presented in Fig. 6 is for catalysts having different electrochemical surface areas, it is not possible to make a direct comparison of the performance of the three-dimensional catalysts studied for the electrolysis of CH3OH or water on a geometric current density basis. Nevertheless, Fig. 6(e) clearly demonstrates that the well-defined low electrochemical surface area and non-porous Pt disk did not perform as well as the dispersed three-dimensional electrode catalysts. Furthermore, it can be seen that the Pt disk electrode, for which no carbon is present, was able to sustain greater current densities for water electrolysis than for CH3OH oxidation. Interestingly, for the 1M CH3OH case at low current densities, two different potential values were obtained for the same current density. The bistability was observed in multiple tests which were performed separately at the same conditions. This phenomenon was also observed for a PEM fuel cell running at 37°C using H2 partial pressure less than 1.5kPa, and 4mg/cm2 Pt–Ru black anode and a 4mg/cm2 Pt black cathode [25]. It was attributed to the total resistance of Nafion®, which is split in an ohmic component, due to proton migration in the membrane's aqueous phase and a non-ohmic one, due to proton tunnelling in the membrane. Fig. 7 shows that the i L values varied with the CH3OH concentration and the type of anode catalyst used. For CH3OH oxidation, the largest limiting current densities were reached with the Pt–Ru/C catalyst. For water electrolysis, the largest limiting current density was reached with the well-defined Pt sheet, however, the i L values obtained for this catalyst are lower in the case of CH3OH oxidation than for water oxidation. Although this well-defined Pt catalyst is not affected by carbon oxidation, its low electrochemical surface area was strongly affected by CO adsorption in the case of CH3OH oxidation. The i L values for the Pt/C catalyst were lower than the one for the unsupported catalyst at low concentrations, while the i L values were similar to the unsupported catalyst ones at high concentration. The i L values for the 4mg/cm2 Pt–Ru black catalyst and for the 2mg/cm2 Pt black catalyst were within the same range. It would be expected that the supported catalysts, which possess higher active areas, would result in higher limiting current densities. Yet, this was not observed for Pt/C and Pt black. Take et al. [18] determined limiting current densities for an active methanol electrolysis electrolytic cell using 5.4cm diameter Pt catalyst coupons (real surface area of 23cm2), at the anode and cathode of 130mA/cm2 for 1M CH3OH, 170mA/cm2 for 2M CH3OH, 210mA/cm2 for 6M CH3OH, and 260mA/cm2 for 16M CH3OH. These reported values are greater than the limiting geometric current densities shown in Fig. 7 for the same CH3OH concentrations using the 2mg/cm2 supported or unsupported Pt catalyst. In the static mode, the transport of the fuel to the electrode is slower and its access to the electrode is more restrained by the CO2 production. This result in lower limiting current densities compared to the active mode. Fig. 8 shows the individual IR corrected anode voltage and cathode voltage, respectively, obtained for stable voltage values before the limiting current density region. It can be seen that the change in cathode voltage is insignificant compared to the change in anode voltage. As the cathode potential remained more or less the same, it can be deduced that the increase in cell voltage required is mainly due to the anode. It can also be seen that higher CH3OH concentrations reduce the anode overpotential. As shown in Fig. 8, the electrolysis of water in 0.5M H2SO4 commences at the anode at a voltage of about −1.3V vs. SHE: (11) H 2 O → 1 / 2 O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − E a o = − 1.23 V vs . SHE At anode voltages equal to and greater than this value for the methanol oxidation reaction, the current efficiency is not 100%, as there is a current loss due to the H2 evolution reaction. Beyond this point, the water electrolysis current density should be subtracted from the CH3OH electro-oxidation current density. At even higher cell voltages, the current density is also increasingly sustained by carbon corrosion. According to thermodynamics, carbon can be oxidized on the anode at a standard voltage of −0.21V vs. SHE: (12) C + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − E a o = − 1.21 V vs . SHE (13) C + H 2 O → CO + 2 H + + 2 e − E a o = − 0.52 V vs . SHE However, the carbon oxidation is kinetically-inhibited and it does not usually begin until a voltage of about 1.8V vs. SHE is reached at the anode [26]. Beyond this voltage, the cell current density is increasingly sustained by carbon corrosion. This was confirmed by the observation of a decrease in cell voltage after re-utilization of catalysts which were subjected to anode potentials equal to or greater than this value. The degradation of the catalyst carbon support and the consequent loss in electrochemical surface area was also confirmed by cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, Ru can dissolve at anodic voltages greater than the standard voltage of −0.249V vs. SHE, as per the following electrochemical reactions: (14) Ru → Ru 2 + + 2 e − E a o = − 0.455 V vs . SHE (15) Ru 2 + → Ru 3 + + e − E a o = − 0.2487 V vs . SHE Hence, as the absolute current density increases and the anode voltage become more positive, a decrease in the CH3OH oxidation performance due to Ru loss can also be anticipated. However, this is likely kinetically limited, like in the case of carbon oxidation. Fig. 9 compares the performance of Pt/C and Pt black catalysts on a real electrochemical current density basis for different CH3OH concentrations. Both catalysts had the same catalyst loading of 2mg/cm2 and Nafion® content of 30wt%, even though the proper amount of ionomer in the unsupported catalyst might be different than for the supported catalyst. The Pt black catalyst had a much smaller real electrochemical surface area than the Pt/C catalyst. It is possible that the non-optimized Nafion® content partly contributed to decrease the surface area of the unsupported catalyst. However, the required applied voltage to oxidize H2O or CH3OH was less for the Pt black catalyst than for the Pt/C catalyst at the same current density. Thus, the Nafion® loading used did not restrain the access to the active surface sites of the black catalyst and did not render it less active than the Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the Pt black catalyst was able to sustain higher real current densities than the Pt/C catalyst at the same CH3OH concentration. It appears that carbon oxidation started to occur at lower real current densities for the Pt/C gas diffusion electrode than for the Pt black gas diffusion electrode. This suggests that the carbon of the supported catalyst oxidizes before the carbon of the carbon fibre paper, on which both catalysts were sprayed, starts to oxidize. 3.2.3 Effect of dry purged cathode Experiments were also conducted with a dry cathode, which was purged with N2 gas, to confirm the feasibility of this possible design simplification. Fig. 10 compares the polarization curves for a DMR running with the cathode compartment filled with 0.5M H2SO4 and for one with a dry cathode compartment purged with N2. The cell voltage became more negative for the DMR operating with a dry purged cathode compartment compared to the DMR with a cathode compartment containing 0.M H2SO4. In the case of CH3OH electrolysis, slightly more voltage is required to drive the electrochemical reaction when the cathode does not contain any electrolytic solution. The reverse effect was observed in the case of water electrolysis at low current densities. In both cases, the required voltage for the dry and wet cases were within 10% at high current densities and similar limiting current densities were attained in the dry and wet cathode case for 0 and 1M CH3OH. However, the AC impedance results indicated that the ohmic resistance across the MEA can be up to about 55% higher in the dry cathode case compared to the wet cathode one, i.e. 0.44Ω versus 0.2Ω for 1M CH3OH. This indicates humidification of the membrane by diffusion of water from the liquid anode side to the dry cathode side in this case might be insufficient to maintain the membrane conductivity. Of course, membrane humidification could be improved by decreasing the membrane thickness and pressurizing the anode side, for example. Fig. 11 (a) and (b) shows the corresponding anode and cathode voltages respectively, for the two cases. The cathode cell voltage remained largely unaffected by the wet or dry cathode operation compared to the anode cell voltage. Fig. 11(a) shows that for CH3OH electrolysis the anode voltage was significantly larger with the dry purged cathode than with the wet cathode. At high enough current densities in both modes, the anode potential is high enough that water electrolysis will also occur in parallel. Although no long term stability tests were conducted, using a dried and purged cathode compartment represents a possible design simplification for the liquid alcohol electrochemical reformer. 3.2.4 Effect of temperature As can be seen in Fig. 12 , increasing the operating temperature significantly improved the 4mg/cm2 Pt–Ru/C electrode kinetics of the methanol electrolysis. There was a large improvement in the electrolyser performance for all catalyst types with temperature. For example, for the 16M CH3OH solution and a current density of 150mA/cm2, the cell voltage was −1.55V, −1.26V and −0.87V corresponding to temperatures of 23, 50 and 75°C, respectively. The reduced electrolytic off-set potentials resulted from an improvement in the mass transport and in the electrode kinetics at the higher temperature. Compared to the limiting current density at 23°C, at 50°C, the limiting current density was about 25mA/cm2 higher in the case of the 2M CH3OH solution, and 50mA/cm2 higher in the case of the 16M CH3OH solution. However, the increase in limiting current densities between 50 and 75°C was not significant, and a similar limiting current was obtained at both temperatures. This is not in agreement with what has been previously observed for active systems [16,17]. For example, Shen et al. [17] using a 2.5mg/cm2 Pt–Ru/C anode and a 1.5mg/cm2 Pt/C cathode in a 2M CH3OH active system showed that over the temperature range of 50–80°C, the voltage at 80°C was reduced to half of the voltage at 50°C. There is no indication that measures were taken to prevent CH3OH loss to the vapour phase. Since the 16M CH3OH solution has a lower boiling point of 76°C, and our study uses a non-flowing system, a partial loss of solution to the vapour phase was possible. It was verified for the 16M CH3OH at 75°C using a K2Cr2O7 reduction technique combined with spectophometric measurements, that the CH3OH concentration changed by less than 2M over the period of time measurements were taken. This small concentration change might partly explain why the limiting current density was similar at 50 and 75°C in the case of the 16M CH3OH solution. In the case of water electrolysis, minor improvements in the anode kinetics were observed with increasing temperature, but the limiting current remained the same over the temperature range of 23–75°C studied. Hence, it is preferable to operate the CH3OH electrolyser at higher temperatures as less current would be wasted for secondary reactions under these conditions. 3.2.5 Anode tafel kinetic analysis In the case CH3OH and H2O electrolysis, the anodic reaction kinetic is slow, resulting in a high overpotential. Hence, the overvoltage at the cathode is negligible compared to the overvoltage at the anode. The Butler–Volmer equation can be simplified to the Tafel equation as per a well-known treatment described elsewhere [27,28]. The anodic form of the Tafel equation was then used to make Tafel plots (log(i) vs. η a ) from which the Tafel slope and the Tafel constant were extracted to obtain kinetic information on the CH3OH and H2O electrolysis. Fig. 13 shows an example of the IR corrected anode overpotential vs. log of the geometric current density for different methanol concentrations, demonstrating the linearity of the Tafel lines obtained. The slope of the anodic Tafel curves for the CH3OH electrolysis changed at about 0.6V for Pt and Pt–Ru catalysts, indicating two distinct kinetic control regions. It was reported that these two regions represent two different reaction mechanisms [29]. In the first region, where η a <∼0.6V vs. SHE, the splitting of the first C–H bond with the first electron charge transfer reaction is the rate-determining step, while in the second region, where η a >∼0.6V vs. SHE, the reaction between the adsorbed CO on Pt sites is the rate-determining step [30]. For water electrolysis on the other hand, only one apparent slope was obtained over the entire potential range for the different catalysts studied. Hence, it is possible that there is only one reaction mechanism over the entire region. However, Kinoshita [31] reported that two distinct Tafel slopes were obtained for most metal oxide based catalysts studied in 1N H3PO4 at 25°C: a low value at low current densities and a high value at high current densities. Tafel parameters reported in the literature for Pt and Pt–Ru catalysts for CH3OH and water electrolysis, along with the values obtained in this study, are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. Only the lower literature Tafel values reported for water electrolysis were included in Table 2 [29,31–40]. For the case of the 4mg/cm2 Pt–Ru anode, the exchange current density values, i o, were approximated by using twice the real surface area determined for the 2mg/cm2 Pt catalyst, as well as the real surface area determined through Cu UPD, for comparison purposes. This is indicated by the superscript a and c, respectively, as indicated in the legend provided at the bottom of Table 3. A proper comparison with the literature is difficult due to differences in the experimental conditions and whether geometric or real surface area was used. The type of electrolyte, the electrolyte and CH3OH concentration, as well as the catalyst loading used varied among the studies and most Tafel parameters available were mainly obtained using single-compartment cells without membranes. In general, the reported Tafel slope using Pt–Ru catalysts ranged from 70 to 128mV/dec at low overpotentials, and ranged from 75 to 777mV/dec at high overpotentials. This is comparable to the 4mg/cm2 Pt–Ru/C catalyst Tafel slopes obtained at low CH3OH concentrations, but smaller than the ones obtained at high CH3OH concentrations in our work. Amongst different systems used to report the Tafel slopes in the literature, the one used by Aramat et al. [35] seems to be the closest to our system. Tafel data was obtained using a two-compartment cell for unsupported catalyst coated with N315 at 16–20°C in 1M CH3OH and 0.5M H2SO4. The Tafel slopes were in the range of 100–140mV/dec for Pt black-N315 in the overvoltage range of 0.4–0.7V vs. SHE, 70mV/dec for Pt–Ru black-N315 at η a <0.5 V vs. SHE and 163mV/dec for the same catalyst at η a >0.6V vs. SHE. The Tafel slopes obtained in our work using a 2mg/cm2 Pt black GDE anode and N117 membrane, were in agreement with the Pt-N315 reported values for η a <0.6 V vs. SHE and CH3OH concentrations equal to or lower than 2M. However, for the Pt black catalyst and CH3OH concentrations, the Tafel slope values we obtained for CH3OH electrolysis at η a >0.6V vs. SHE are up to four times higher than the one reported. This may be linked to a change in the rate determining step at higher potentials, as it is known that CO stripping from an unsupported Pt–Ru catalyst surface normally occurs at potentials ranging from about 0.5 to 0.7V vs. SHE at 25°C [41,42]. Tafel slopes were also evaluated as a function of temperature using the 4mg/cm2 Pt–Ru/C anode at three different CH3OH concentrations. Zhang et al. [36] reported that at low temperatures, non-linearity is due to CO poisoning, while at high temperature, it is due to concentration polarization. They also noticed that Tafel slope data reported in the literature conflictingly increase or decrease with increasing temperature. This was attributed to different rate determining steps. In our study, the Tafel slopes values obtained for Pt–Ru/C were larger at ambient temperature than at 50°C, and the values obtained for the same catalyst at 75°C were the largest of all. Although it might be possible that the catalyst went through degradation at higher temperature, it is also possible that operation at 50°C is more desirable for the Pt–Ru/C catalyst as it improves its activity for the electrolysis of CH3OH. From an efficiency standpoint, faster oxidation kinetics might allow the use of higher CH3OH concentrations. In general, reported Tafel slope values for Pt–Ru/C varied between 108 and 195mV/dec in the temperature range of 60–80°C [29,34,36,37], compared to experimental values obtained in this study which ranged from 126 to 215mV/dec between 50 and 75°C. For η a <0.6V, the Tafel slopes obtained at 75°C and 2–16M CH3OH averaged 211mV/dec. This seems to be in reasonable agreement with the 192mV/dec reported on 30wt% Pt–Ru/C on glassy carbon at 80°C and low CH3OH concentration in a single compartment cell [36]. The effect of CH3OH concentration on the kinetic parameters seems to be complex and no clear trend could be established for the change in b and i o values as a function of increasing CH3OH concentration. However, it can be observed that at ambient conditions and low overpotentials, the lowest Tafel slopes were obtained using the Pt/C anode, while the greatest Tafel slopes were obtained using the Pt–Ru/C anode. It was suggested by Zhang et al. [36] that high b values on Pt–Ru/C are due to the initial dissociative dehydrogenation of CH3OH while low b values for Pt/C are due to the oxidation of CO rather than an adsorption process. Based on the real surface area of a 2mg/cm2 catalyst determined by H2 adsorption, at 2M CH3OH and for η a <0.6V, the b value obtained in this study was about 30% larger for Pt–Ru/C than for Pt/C, and the i o value was about 96% smaller for Pt/C than for Pt–Ru/C. Hence, under those conditions, the oxidation of CH3OH occurs faster on Pt–Ru/C than on Pt/C. For the same conditions, but at η a >0.6V, the b value obtained was also about 30% larger for Pt–Ru/C than for Pt/C. Similarly, the value of i o was about still 96% smaller for Pt/C than for Pt–Ru/C. The i o value determined based on the real surface area of the 4mg/cm2 Pt–Ru/C catalyst obtained by Cu UPD was even larger. Therefore, under those conditions, Pt–Ru/C possesses a superior catalytic activity for the electrolysis of CH3OH than Pt/C. This difference was not observed between the Pt–Ru black and Pt black anodes at ambient conditions, which had similar Tafel slopes at all concentrations. For pure Pt, at CH3OH concentrations of 1M or less, reported Tafel slopes ranged from 63 to 125mV/dec below 0.6V, and no Tafel data was reported for Pt above 0.6V. As previously mentioned, bistability was observed for the well-defined Pt case at 1M CH3OH and two Tafel slopes could be calculated. In the same potential range, it seems that the Tafel value obtained for the more positive curve (49mV/dec) is in much better agreement with the literature than the one obtained for the more negative curves (400mV/dec). The Tafel slope value of 121mV/dec obtained for water electrolysis using the well-defined Pt disk is in agreement with the reported value range of 65–145mV/dec at 20–25°C, however the corresponding i o value is 100% smaller than the ones reported in the literature. For water electrolysis, the Tafel slope was about 40% larger for the Pt–Ru black catalyst than for the Pt black catalyst. However, the i o value obtained was 100% larger for Pt–Ru black catalyst than for the Pt black catalyst, and larger than the other i o values obtained for all of the other catalysts tested for water electrolysis. With the Pt–Ru/C anode, at 50 and 75°C, the Tafel slopes for the water electrolysis were about 60% higher, than when using the same catalyst at ambient conditions. Based on this, it seems like Pt catalyst is a more favourable catalyst than the Pt–Ru catalyst for water electrolysis. However, Miles et al. [43] reported that Pt–Ru black was a better catalyst than Pt black for the O2 evolution reaction in 0.1M H2SO4 at 80°C. This was attributed to the formation of an oxide film which decreased the Pt surface catalytic activity towards O2 evolution. The kinetic parameters reported for electrolysis are varied and often contradictory. It is important to note that at IR corrected anodic overpotentials greater than 0.6V, mass transport effects are not negligible. Hence, the kinetic parameters extracted in this region do not likely represent true kinetic behaviour and have to be considered with caution and could explain some of the variability in reported results. A low overpotential, which is desired to use energy efficiently and to operate as close as possible to equilibrium, can be obtained by choosing a catalyst material and system resulting in a b value as small as possible and an i o value as large as possible for the desired electrochemical reaction. 3.2.6 Activation energy analysis Using the exchange current densities, based on real surface area, estimated from the intercept of the Tafel Plots, Arrhenius plots (log(i o ) vs. 1/T) were made for various methanol concentrations in the linear kinetic Tafel region (<0.6V) and in the region just above 0.6V, where the effect of mass transfer starts to appear. The apparent activation energy, E a, was determined from the slope of the fitted linear trends. The values obtained, as well as some values reported in the literature, are included in Table 4 [29,36–38,44]. In agreement with the literature [36], over the concentration range studied, the larger the CH3OH concentration, the larger was the resulting E a value. The E a values obtained with the Pt–Ru/C anode in the kinetic region below 0.6V are significantly lower than the smallest values reported in the literature, although the E a values reported in the literature were obtained in single compartment cells and not using MEAs as in the present study. Zhang et al. [36] have reported that small Ea values (20–30kJ/mol) obtained at low CH3OH concentrations (0.1–0.5M), indicate that CO surface diffusion is the rate determining step. These researchers obtained larger E a values (51–84kJ/mol), at higher CH3OH concentrations (1, 2M) representing a change in the rate determining step. At E a values around 60kJ/mol, the dissociative adsorption of CH3OH is the rate determining step, while at E a values around 70kJ/mol, CO oxidation is the rate determining step. In this study, the Ea values obtained in the region below 0.6V vs. SHE for 2 and 16M CH3OH are both below 30kJ/mol. This might signify that, under those conditions, CO surface diffusion is the rate determining step. The E a values obtained in the region above 0.6V vs. SHE for 2 and 16M CH3OH are 50 and 154kJ/mol, respectively. Although there were no changes in the rate determining step for the electrolysis of CH3OH on Pt–Ru/C as a function of CH3OH concentration in the low potential region, there might be one in the high potential region."
9,Conclusion,"It was thermodynamically and experimentally demonstrated that H2 production from methanol electrolysis in aqueous acidic media is significantly more effective than the H2 production from acidic water electrolysis. The theoretical thermodynamic evaluation proved that the alcohol electrochemical reforming systems could become thermodynamically favourable under certain operating conditions. It was estimated that in the liquid phase CH3OH electrolysis becomes thermodynamically favourable at about 48°C. However, it was demonstrated that at 50 and 75°C, the kinetics were not favourable and energy was required to electrochemically generate H2 from the acidic aqueous CH3OH solution with all catalysts. The kinetics of the PEM electrolyser were investigated for the first time under static conditions, i.e., stirred solutions, but no flow through or recycling systems. Because of the large difference in voltages between H2O and CH3OH electrolysis, it was possible to identify a clear operating range where the Faradaic efficiency difference is high. The electrolysis has to be conducted at conditions that avoid carbon oxidation or more stable materials comprising no carbon should be used. In acidic aqueous media and for all operating conditions, carbon oxidation and catalyst degradation prevented the DMR from sustaining higher currents in the vicinity of the limiting current. Operating the CH3OH electrolyser with a dry cathode, purged with N2 resulted in similar cell voltage requirements for electrolysis, particularly at high current densities. Very limited kinetic data was found to describe similar electrochemical systems in the literature. Only two studies were found to report kinetic data on catalyzed membranes or electrodes with membranes. All data available focused on the electro-oxidation of CH3OH and not on an electrochemical reformer and was determined for low concentrations of CH3OH (<2M). Tafel kinetic analysis revealed that Pt–Ru binary catalysts enhance the kinetics of the methanol oxidation in the water-methanol electrolysis process. The activation energy obtained with the MEA was found to be in the same range as previously reported values for similar systems. A comprehensive baseline study and data base was established for future comparison. Studies to further improve the kinetics of the direct methanol reforming process are in progress."
