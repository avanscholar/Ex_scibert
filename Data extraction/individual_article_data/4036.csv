0,Introduction,"Hydrogels with high water content and porous structure are similar to extracellular matrices (ECM) of the organism and have been widely applied in the tissue engineering [1], drug delivery [2], 3D print [3] and wound repair [4]. At present, hydrogels are mainly classified into natural product hydrogels and synthetic product hydrogels according to raw material sources. Among them, natural product hydrogels are the hot area of current research due to their good biological properties [5]. Chitosan is the only polycationic polysaccharide in nature and contained a variety of excellent characteristics including good biocompatibility, bacteriostatic, biodegradability and wound promotion, etc., and the remarkable characteristics above make the emergence of chitosan-based hydrogels in recent years [6–12]. The stiffness of the tissue engineering materials is one of the important factors affecting cell behavior, including adhesion, proliferation and differentiation [13]. In addition, most chitosan-based hydrogel materials have not been applied to tissue engineering repair due to their weak mechanical properties [14]. For example, the young modulus of human cartilage and cancellous reached the range of 25–40 KPa and 2–12 MPa [15]. In recent years, numerous work have been carried out to improve the mechanical properties of hydrogels, such as double crosslinked hydrogel [16], double network hydrogel [17], organic-inorganic hybrid hydrogel [18] and nanocomposite hydrogel [19], etc. The DN hydrogel, firstly proposed by Gong et al. [20], are considered to be one of the most promising hydrogel systems to overcome above challenge. The DN hydrogel is prepared by combining the rigid network and the flexible network based on physical or chemical cross-linking, where the rigid network can effectively consume the fracture energy during the deformation process and the flexible network can ensure the integrity of the hydrogel [21]. The interlacing and entanglement of the first network and the second network based on different aggregation methods effectively enhances the conduction and dispersion of pressure, and imparts excellent mechanical properties to the hydrogel [22]. A series of double network hydrogels with excellent mechanical properties have been successfully prepared in the recent years including PEG/PAA, PBDT/PAAm, alginate/PAAm, PEU/PMMA and agarose/PEG, etc. [23–26], based on constructing covalent interactions or non-covalent interaction inside the polymer molecular chains. However, toxic residues (precursors, monomers, initiators and cross linkers) [27,28] and low cell binding capacity (interaction between polymer surface and cells [29]) limited the application of covalent cross-linked double network hydrogel in tissue engineering. On the other hand, the rupture of the covalent cross-linking network is unrecoverable once the external pressure exceeds the critical value, which unable to balance strength and toughness of hydrogel [30]. Non-covalent bonds are the dynamic interaction involving hydrogen bonding, ionic bonds and intermolecular interactions, and the bonds enable spontaneously reconstruct after being destroyed [31–33]. More recently, the preparation of high-strength and high-toughness dual-network hydrogels based on non-covalent interactions has aroused the attention of the majority of scholars. Zhou et al. constructed a dual physical crosslinked chitosan/PAA hydrogel based on positive-negative charge and hydrophobic interactions [34]. Zhang et al. synthesized a tough DN hydrogel consisting of PBMA as the first network and PAM as the second network. Hydrogen bonds were formed between the carboxylic acid groups on the first network and the amide groups on the PAM chains [35]. Martínez and Hebeish et al. prepared the chitosan-PVA composite hydrogels based on freezing-thawing cycles and have been applied in various fields [36–41]. The researches above both proved that physical cross-linking could effectively absorb mechanical energy and reconstituted after pressure disappeared. However, the chitosan itself could not form the hard hydrogel network in the acidic environment, and the concentration of dissolved was also greatly limited in 1–2 wt%. In addition, the formation of the hydrogel mainly depends on the formation of a crystalline structure inside the PVA and its hydrogen bonding with the chitosan molecular chains. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the hydrogel prepared by the above scheme could not meet the application of some special fields such as cartilage repair and bone repair. In this work, we constructed a physically crosslinked DN hydrogel (based on multiple hydrogen bonding interactions) by applying a simple freezing-heating alternate treatment to the chitosan-PVA alkaline (KOH/urea) solution. In the low temperature environment, the PVA molecular chains could form the crystalline region and interacted with chitosan chains by forming stable hydrogen bonds to construct the first network [42]. In addition, the second network was constructed by recovering the original strong hydrogen bonding interactions between chitosan molecular chains by increasing the temperature (45 °C) of chitosan-PVA alkaline solution, and the concentrations of chitosan solution could been increased to 5 wt% [43]. Subsequent studies indicated that chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel displayed excellent anti-swell, compressive and recoverable properties, and the further in vitro and in vivo biological evaluations also indicated that the hydrogel had potential for application in tissue engineering."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The chitosan (Mw = 1150 KD was determined by viscosity method [44] and DD = 85.7% was determined by elemental analysis [45]) was purchased from Shandong lai zhou hay li biological product. PVA (DP of 2600 ± 50), KOH, urea and other chemical reagents were purchased from chemical reagent company of China and without further processing."
3,The preparation of chitosan-PVA hydrogel,"2.2 The preparation of chitosan-PVA hydrogel The KOH, urea, distilled water and chitosan (16:8:71:5 by weight) were added into the reaction bottle and placed in a −20 °C refrigerator. Then, the transparent 5 wt% chitosan solution could be obtained after 2 h. The 5 wt% PVA solution was obtained by putting 5 g PVA into 95 g water (85 °C) and stirring for 1.5 h. Then, the chitosan solution and PVA solution were mixed and stirred in the 25 °C for 30 min. To prepare the first PVA physical crosslink network, three cycles freezing (−20 °C) - thawing (25 °C) process were being executed in the mixture. After that, the mixture was heated at 45 °C for 1.5 h to form second chitosan physical crosslink network. At last, the hydrogel was dialyzed against distilled water to pH = 7 for characterization. The hydrogels (CPHs) were called CPH-0, CPH-25, CPH-50, CPH-75 and CPH-100 based on the weight percent of PVA (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100) respectively."
4,The characterization of CPHs,"2.3 The characterization of CPHs The FTIR spectra of hydrogel was recorded on a Nicolet FTIR 5700 spectrophotometer (Madison, WI, USA) at different wavelengths from 4000 to 400 cm−1. The crystal phase of hydrogel was evaluated by XRD spectrometer (RINT2000/PC, Rigaku, Japan) with the diffraction angle 2θ from 5° to 60° at a scanning rate of 2°/min. The morphology of the hydrogel was observed using the SEM (JSM-6010LA, JEOL Ltd., Japan). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments of hydrogel was carried out on a DSC 200 PC (NETZSCH, Germany) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min."
5,The swelling properties of CPHs,"2.4 The swelling properties of CPHs 1.5 g cylindrical hydrogel (diameter = 11 mm) was immersed into PBS (0.02 M, pH = 7.4) at 37 °C. The weight and diameter of the swelling hydrogel at 24 h were measured, and the change ratio was calculated: (1) Weight and Diameter change ratio % = Wafter – Wbefore Wbefore × 100"
6,The mechanical properties of CPHs,"2.5 The mechanical properties of CPHs The compressive modulus of CPH was carried out on a Dynamic mechanical analysis (Q800 series, USA) at 25 °C. The hydrogels (11 mm diameter × 15 mm height) were conducted at the rate of 20 mN/min. Hydrogel samples were prepared into cylindrical shape (15 mm length × 3 mm in width × 1 mm high) for tensile test at 25 °C with a speed of 6 mm/min at 100% strain and then recovered to 0% strain with a speed of 6 mm/min."
7,Hemolysis test of CPHs,"2.6 Hemolysis test of CPHs The CPH-25, CPH-50 and CPH-75 (300 mg) were added in 3 ml normal saline and cultured for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, 100 μl ant coagulated blood were added into the solutions and cultured at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, the mixtures were centrifuged and the supernatants were determined at 545 nm by UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-1750, Shimadzu Co, Ltd., Japan). The hemolysis rate (HR %) was calculated with distilled water as positive control (100% lysis) and normal saline as the negative control (0% lysis) by the following equation: (2) HR % = Ds − Dn Dp − Dn × 100"
8,Coagulation effect of CPHs,"2.7 Coagulation effect of CPHs For clotting time measurement, the CPHs (100 mg) were added into 1 ml normal saline and cultured for 10 min at 37 °C. Then, 1 ml whole blood was fully mixed with 100 mg CPHs and incubated at 37 °C. The clotting reaction was activated by adding 50 μl CaCl2 solution (0.02 mol/l) to the mixture [46], and the clotting time was defined when the blood solidification."
9,In vitro cytotoxicity of CPHs,"2.8 In vitro cytotoxicity of CPHs Rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) and Mouse fibroblast cell line (L929) were seeded on the plates (1 × 104 cells/ml in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum) at 37 °C for 12 h. Then, the medium were replaced by 0.1 ml DMEM (control) and CPH extracts (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.1, 0.2 g/mL), and the cell plates were cultured at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 24, 48 and 72 h. Finally, CCK-8 (CA1210) reagent (10 μl) was added into the plates and cultured at 37 °C for 4 h. The absorption values were determined at 450 nm, and the relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated by the following equation: (3) RGR % = ODtest ODcontrol × 100 For morphology studies, the L929s and rBMSCs (cultured on the plates and CPH) were stained with 4 μmol/ml calcein-AM and then observed by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon TS 100, Japan) at 3 d."
10,In vivo evaluations of the CPHs,"2.9 In vivo evaluations of the CPHs All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the local Animal Welfare Committee. 5-week-old SD rats (Qingdao Drug Inspection Institute, Shanghai, China) with an average weight of 180 ± 5 g were used and randomly divided into three groups: Control, CPH-0 and CPH-50 groups. The operation for each animal was performed under intravenous anesthesia (pentobarbital, 25 mg/kg) and sterile conditions. To identify the histocompatibility of CPHs, 10 rats were used. A skin defect (length = 15 mm) was created in the back sides of rat, and then the hydrogel (11 mm diameter × 3 mm height) was implanted, a non-implanted defect in the opposite as a control. After surgery, the rats were housed in ventilated rooms and given access to water and food."
11,Histological evaluation,"2.10 Histological evaluation The skin tissue samples were fixed in 4 wt% paraformaldehyde, and longitudinally sectioned into slices with an approximate thickness of 5 um using a paraffin microtome (Lei ca EG 1160). The sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson to observe new tissues. Meantime, the immunohistochemical staining of TNF- ɑ also be used for detecting the inflammation. The TNF- ɑ expression were analyzed by Image-pro plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) based on average optical method."

13,Results and discussion,
14,The preparation of CPHs,"3.1 The preparation of CPHs The design idea of chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel based on hydrogen bonding was showed in the Fig. 1a. The PVA solution changed from sol state to gel state after repeated freeze-thawing treatment for 3 cycles, and the chitosan alkaline solution formed the hydrogel after being incubated at 45 °C for 1.5 h. Summarized the above findings, we prepared the chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel by mixing PVA solution with chitosan alkaline solution and exerting the freezing-heating alternate treatment. The formation mechanism of DN hydrogel was showed in the Fig. 1b. The PVA first network was introduced by the freezing-thawing process. In the low temperature environment, the PVA molecular chains could form the crystalline region and interacted with chitosan chains to form stable hydrogen bonds [47]. In addition, the second chitosan network was formed by increasing the temperature of the environment to 45 °C, which could destroy the dynamic equilibrium of hydrogen bonds between chitosan chains [43], and lead to the formation of chitosan network. Subsequently, the compressive performances of CPH-0 and CPH-50 were showed in the Fig. 1c. The simple chitosan hydrogel (CPH-0) broke when subjected to critical pressure extrusion, and the DN hydrogel (CPH-50) retained the original morphology after the same stress test. Previous researches have proved that rigid chains and flexible random coils were the main forms of chitosan and PVA in the solution [14]. In this work, the DN hydrogel was prepared by combining the rigid chitosan network and the flexible PVA network based on multiple hydrogen bonding, where the rigid network could effectively consume the fracture energy during the deformation process and the flexible network could ensure the integrity of the hydrogel [35]."
15,The characterization of CPHs,"3.2 The characterization of CPHs The FITR spectra of CPHs were showed in the Fig. 2a. For the CPH-100, the peak at 3508 cm− 1 was the characteristic peak of OH. The peaks at 2930 cm− 1 and 2860 cm− 1 both indicated the stretching vibration of the CH bond. The peak at 1620 cm− 1 indicated the stretching vibration of the CO bond in polyvinyl acetate (the precursor of PVA). The peaks at 1417 cm− 1 indicated the deformation vibration of the CO bond, while that at 1085 cm− 1 indicated the stretching vibration [48]. In the spectrum of CPH-0, the peak at 3410 cm− 1 is the characteristic peak of OH. The peaks at 2841 cm− 1 indicated the stretching vibration of the CH bond. The peak at 1041 cm− 1 indicated the stretching vibration of the CO bond. The peaks at 1615 cm− 1 indicated the deformation vibration of the NH bond [49]. The Fig. 2a also showed that there were no new absorption peaks appeared in the spectra of CPH-25, CPH-50 and CPH-100, which indicated that no chemical cross-linking reaction occurred in the preparation process of chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel. However, the characteristic peak (OH) of CPH-25, CPH-50 and CPH-75 changed from 3410 cm− 1 to 3500–3550 cm− 1 compared with CPH-0, and the higher strength NH deformation vibration could be observed in the spectra of CPH-25, CPH-50 and CPH-75 (Fig, S1). The deformation vibration of characteristic peak (OH and NH) indicated the formed of multiple hydrogen bonding inside the chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel [50]. The XRD spectra was carried out to determine the crystallinity of CPHs. As the Fig. 2b showed, the absorption peaks at 10° and 20° were the characteristic peaks of chitosan, and the absorption peaks at 19.5° and 22.5° were the characteristic peaks of PVA [51]. After the freezing-thawing process, a new absorption peak appeared in the CPH-100, CPH-75, CPH-50 and CPH-25 at 41°, suggesting the reconstruction of internal hydrogen bonding in PVA. The characteristic peak of chitosan at 10° tended to disappear with the increased proportion of PVA, and the absorption peak of PVA at 22.5° showed significant enhancement. The change of crystal structure in the CPHs demonstrated that the formed of multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between molecular chains of chitosan and PVA. The thermogravimetric analysis was carried out to detect the thermal stability of CPHs. As the Fig. 2d showed, the thermal decomposition of chitosan and PVA mainly occurred in 360 °C. However, the introduction of PVA made the thermal decomposition of CPH-25, CPH-50 and CPH-75 change to the higher temperature. The detailed results could be found in the Fig. 2c, the weight loss peak at 80–100 °C indicated the volatilization of adsorbed and bound water, and the weight loss peak at 350–500 °C indicated the thermal decomposition of chitosan and PVA. The previous reports have proved that the small weight loss at 75–100 °C of PVA/chitosan composite hydrogel was due to the loss of adsorbed and bound water, and the bound water in the hydrogel network interacted with polymer molecular chains primarily through hydrogen bonding [37,39]. With the introduction of PVA, the weight loss peak of water increased from 80 °C (for CPH-0 and CPH-100) to 86 °C, 91 °C and 100 °C (for CPH-50, CPH-25 and CPH-75), and the main thermal decomposition peaks of CPH-25, CPH-50 and CPH-75 changed from 360 °C to 380–390 °C. The results above displayed that the strong multiple hydrogen bonding not only enhanced the thermal stability of bound water existed in the hydrogel network, but also significantly enhanced the thermal stability of the CPHs. All the results above indicated that the strong multiple hydrogen bonding formed inside the chitosan-PVA mixture based on alternating freezing-heating treatment process and constructed high strength and toughness chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel."
16,The swelling properties of CPHs,"3.3 The swelling properties of CPHs High water content hydrogels are ideal tissue engineering material due to its structural similarity to human tissue. Therefore, the swelling performance was one of the important indicators for evaluating materials used in tissue engineering [52]. In this work, the CPHs were immersed into PBS (0.02 M, pH = 7.4) at 37 °C for 24 h to detect the change rate of diameter and weight. As the Fig. 3a shown that, all the hydrogels could keep the shape intact without breaking, and the swelling rate increased with the raising of PVA proportion. Detail analyses could be found in the Fig. 3b and c, the change rate of diameter were 1.3%, 4%, 9%, 18% and 36% for CPH-0, CPH-25, CPH-50, CPH-75 and CPH-100, and the change rate of weight were 2%, 11%, 29%, 64% and 154% for CPH-0, CPH-25, CPH-50, CPH-75 and CPH-100. The water molecules could rapidly bind to the hydrophilic PVA and chitosan chains, when they entered the network structure inside the chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel. However, the previous reports have proved that chitosan could only be dissolved in acidic and some alkaline dissolution systems due to its strong internal hydrogen bonding [53], and the PVA could be dissolved in water. Therefore, the significantly increase of swelling rate came down to the introduction of PVA. The microstructure of hydrogels have a significantly effect on their swelling, mechanical properties and application fields. The internal structure of CPHs were observed by SEM and showed in the Fig. 3d. High density porous network structure could be detected in the CPH-0, and the pore diameter tended to increase with the introduction of PVA (for CPH-25, CPH-50, CPH-75 and CPH-100), consisting with the results of swelling tests. In addition, the chitosan/PVA DN hydrogel displayed complete and thick pore wall compared with the wire mesh structure of chitosan hydrogel, which could effectively increase the flexibility of hydrogels. The porous structure of a hydrogel markedly affects cell viability by influencing the transfer of nutrients, and a higher porous ratio results in a higher permeability for oxygen, nutrients, and other water-soluble metabolites [3]. All the results above indicated that the CPHs had potential for application in the field of tissue engineering."
17,The mechanical characterizations of CPHs,"3.4 The mechanical characterizations of CPHs The stiffness of the tissue engineering materials is one of the important factors affecting cell behavior, including adhesion, proliferation and differentiation [54]. In addition, most hydrogel materials have not been applied to tissue engineering repair due to their weak mechanical properties. For example, the young modulus of human cartilage and bone reached the range of 25–40 KPa and 2–12 MPa [55]. Fig. 4a and b showed the recovery rate of CPHs after a 60% compression ratio (5 cycles). We noted that CPH-0 broken and unable to restore the original shape after the first compression test. However, the CPH-50 could keep the shape intact and restore 80% of the original height after 5 cycles test. The Fig. 4a displayed that the fatigue resistance of the CPHs were significantly improved with the increase of the PVA specific gravity. The Fig. 4d–f showed the cyclic compression tests of CPH-25, CPH-50 and CPH-75 at a strain of 60%. As the number of cycles increased, the compression curve of the CPH-25 occurred separation, indicating the damage of the internal structure of hydrogel, and the above phenomenon tended to disappear with increasing PVA specific gravity. Meantime, the results also displayed that the compressive stress of CPH-75 obviously decreased compared with CPH-50 and CPH-25. The tension stress strain curves of CPHs at strains from 0% to fracture were showed in the Fig. 4g. The breaking strength of CPHs decreased with the increase of PVA specific gravity, and the maximum elongation increased with the increase of PVA specific gravity. As the Fig. 4h shown, the cyclic tensile test curves of CPH-50 capable of fully overlapping after the 5 cycles reciprocating test, and the hydrogel did not break during the whole process (Fig. 4i). The detailed results were showed in the Fig. 4c. The CPH-0 achieved 230 KPa (compression stress), 381 KPa (Young modulus for compression), 432 KPa (tensile strength), 71% (break strain) and 617 KPa (Young modulus); The CPH-25 achieved 140 KPa (compression stress), 233 KPa (Young modulus for compression), 272 KPa (tensile strength), 148% (break strain) and 182 KPa (Young modulus); The CPH-50 achieved 59 KPa (compression stress), 97 KPa (Young modulus for compression), 243 KPa (tensile strength), 289% (break strain) and 83.8 KPa (Young modulus); The CPH-75 achieved 43 KPa (compression stress), 72 KPa (Young modulus for compression), 152 KPa (tensile strength), 360% (break strain) and 42.2 KPa (Young modulus). All the results above confirmed the design idea of this work, the chitosan second physical network absorbed a large amount of fracture energy, and the PVA first physical network maintained the complete shape of the hydrogel during compression and tensile process, which contributed to the perfect mechanical properties of CPHs. In the latter work, the mechanical properties of the DN hydrogel could be dynamically adjusted by adjusting the ratio of chitosan and PVA to lay the foundation for its application in many fields such as tissue engineering."
18,Blood compatibility of CPHs,"3.5 Blood compatibility of CPHs To expand its application in tissue engineering, the hemolysis and coagulation of CPHs hydrogels were evaluated. As the Fig. 5a showed, the hemolysis rates of CPHs were <5% (national standard) [56], and the results above displayed that the material was safe to contact with blood. In addition, co-incubation of CPHs hydrogels with blood did not shorten the clotting time (within 14.9–15.5 min for CPHs) compared to the control (15.2 min) (Fig. 5b), indicating that the hydrogels were not at risk of causing blood clots."
19,The in vitro cytocompatibility of CPHs,"3.6 The in vitro cytocompatibility of CPHs Whether hydrogel were used in biomedicine, petrochemical or agricultural fields, the safety of the material was an inevitable problem [57]. Therefore, in the last section of this work, we evaluated the safety of CPHs by cell compatibility experiments. As shown in the Fig. 6a, the relative proliferation rate of L929 cells and rBMSCs exceeded 80% compared with the control after incubated with CPH-25, CPH-50 and CPH-75 for 24, 48 and 72 h. Furthermore, the results of fluorescence microscopy were presented in the Fig. 6b. There was no significant difference in the cells number of CPHs compared with the control, and the test cells both showed perfect spindle-shaped. All the results proved that the CPHs were safe and non-toxic for using in the tissue engineering repair."
20,The histocompatibility of CPHs in vivo,"3.7 The histocompatibility of CPHs in vivo To detect the application prospect of composite hydrogel in the field of tissue engineering repair, the histocompatibility of the CPH-0 and CPH-50 were evaluated by a subcutaneous implantation model established in the back skin of the rats. As shown in the Fig. 7a, a 15 mm length wound was created in the epidermis, and then the 11 mm diameter × 3 mm height hydrogel was implanted, a non-implanted wound in the opposite as a control. The detailed appearance and histological evaluation was showed in the Fig. 7b. The scar tissue formed after wound healing could be clearly observed in the control group (arrow 1for control). However, no obvious scar tissue appeared in the hydrogel groups (arrow 1 for CPH-0 and CPH-50) after 4 weeks. In addition, the significant atrophy of hydrogel occurred in the CPH-0 group (arrow 2 for CPH-0) compared with the CPH-50 group (arrow 2 for CPH-50) indicating the broken and degradation of CPH-0. The results indicated that the presence of hydrogel effectively increased the rate of wound healing and reduced the formation of scar tissue. The H§E staining analysis of control, CPH-0 and CPH-50 after 4 weeks showed that a large number of new capillaries appear on the inside of the lesion, and (arrow 3 for control, CPH-0 and CPH-50), and the thickness of the epithelial tissue in the hydrogel groups were significantly higher (29.6 um for CPH-0 group and 48.2 um for CPH-50) than that in the control (20.4 um for control group) (Fig. 7c and d). Increased expression of collagen can effectively promote the transformation of fibroblasts into epithelial tissue to promote wound healing [58]. Mason staining further evaluated the skin repair in different groups, and the muscle tissue and collagen fibers were dyed red and blue, respectively. The results displayed that more collagen fibers (arrow 4) appeared in the hydrogel group than in the control group indicating a better wound repair status. TNF-α is a tumor necrosis factor, which can promote the production of various inflammatory factors by immune cells, thereby promoting the inflammatory response. Therefore, detecting the expression level of TNF-α can indicate the inflammatory response in the body [59]. The Fig. 7b for TNF-ɑ staining analysis and Fig. 7e showed that the expression of inflammatory factors were at a low level, and there was no significant difference between the hydrogel groups and the control group proving the implantation of hydrogels was safe and non-toxic for skin tissue. The degradation rate of hydrogel in tissues is one of the important criteria for evaluating it's as a tissue engineering repair material and the excessive degradation makes hydrogel materials unable to provide effective support for hard tissue repair including the cartilage and bone [60,61]. First, the Fig. 8 for H§E and Masson staining analysis showed that newborn granulation (arrow 1) tissue and capillaries (arrow 4) appeared in all experimental groups after 4 weeks predicting the reconstruction of the skin tissue, and the massive expression of collagen fibers (arrow 3) in CPH-0 and CPH-50 groups also indicated the promotion of hydrogel on wound healing. In addition, CPH-0 had undergone significant cracking and degradation (arrow 2 for CPH-0 groups) after 4 weeks subcutaneous implantation. However, CPH-50 maintained its morphological integrity without significant degradation. The result proved that the introduction of PVA greatly improved the stability of hydrogel and solved the drawbacks of excessive degradation of chitosan-based hydrogels. At last, the Fig. 8 for TNF-ɑ staining analysis and Fig. 7f showed that there was no significant difference between the hydrogel groups and the control group indicating good histocompatibility for hydrogels. All the results above indicated that the chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel with excellent mechanical and biocompatibility properties had good application prospects in the field of bone tissue engineering such as cartilage and meniscus repair [62]."
21,Conclusion,"In this work, the multiple non-covalent hydrogen bonding interactions were introduced into the chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel through a simple freezing-heating process. The hydrogen bonding interactions are the dynamic interaction and enable spontaneously reconstruct after being destroyed. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding inside the hydrogel network could block water molecules from entering the polymer molecular chains and reduced the swelling rate of the hydrogel. The introduction of PVA and the construction of dynamic hydrogen bonding greatly enhanced the toughness and fatigue resistance of chitosan hydrogel. Meantime, the controllability of hydrogel strength and toughness was achieved by controlling the specific gravity of chitosan and PVA. In addition, L929 s and rBMSCs cells could adhesion, proliferate and exhibit the fusiform state in the surface of chitosan-PVA DN hydrogel. The in vivo subcutaneous implantation in rats also displayed that the hydrogel could promote wound healing and reduce the formation of scar tissue. This work developed a novel tissue engineering repair hydrogel and provided a new idea for the preparation of DN hydrogels based on non-covalent interactions.
