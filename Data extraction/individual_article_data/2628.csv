0,Introduction,"Titanium and its alloys are used in lots of fields, including aerospace, biomedical, and automotive industries owing to their excellent performance, such as high fracture toughness, high strength, great biocompatibility and excellent corrosion resistance [1–7]. In all titaniums, Ti6Al4V is a popular alloy based on its outstanding properties, so Ti6Al4V occupied almost a half of the market share of titanium alloy products in the worldwide [4]. Although Ti6Al4V has a wide range of applications, the Ti6Al4V parts fabricated by traditional manufacturing methods like cast, forging, rolling can no longer meet the needs of using, which greatly limits the application of titanium in aerospace and load bearing field [8]. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a new manufacturing way, which requires the method having high precision and great flexibility to meet desired service requirements [9]. Compared to traditional manufacturing process, additive manufacturing (AM) of titanium alloys has various advantages including low cost, no mold required, short processing cycle. Laser melting deposition (LMD) is a typical way of AM. In LMD process, a laser interacts with feedstock powders and a molten pool is formed, where rapid melting and resolidification happens [10]. However, some factors such as low thermal conductivity of titanium, highly localized heat input and short interaction time, which will result in a large temperature gradient and high cooling rate [11,12]. These unique thermal features affect the microstructure and will produce high residual stress, which determine their macroscopic properties [13,14]. In additive manufacturing, the most important factor that affects macroscopic properties is coarse CG. Laser selective melting of Ti6Al4V often generates 100–200 µm CG along the build direction and its size is determined by the deposited height and specific process parameters [15–20]. The size of CG formed by laser melting deposition are larger whose width can reach more than 3 mm, and large CG close to penetrating alone the build direction [21–24]. Moreover, The arc wire deposition forms coarse primary β grains whose width reach of 5 mm [25]. In order to solve the problem that coarse CG appeared in LMD, a new manufacturing process called thermo-hydrogen processing (THP) is generally applied to improve microstructure in AM [26,27]. Thermal hydrogen process technology in titanium alloy, also called hydrogen treatment or hydrogen process [28–30]. Hydrogen is used because of its positive impacts on the microstructure and the property, including hot/cold working, machine, and so on. Moreover, as a β phase stabilizer element, hydrogen declines β phase transition temperature, which makes the heat treatment at lower temperatures. Hydrogen reduces high temperature plastic deformation resistance, improves plastic deformation conditions. Relying on the reversible alloying, hydrogen-induced plasticity, hydrogen-induced phase transition and weak bond effect of hydrogen in titanium alloys, the metallurgical microstructure can be improved [31,32]. The weak bond effect of hydrogen promotes the diffusion of solutes in the molten pool during LMD. At the same time, the eutectoid reaction of hydrogen during the solidification process are commonly used to promote nucleation [33,34]. In this study, THP treatment is an important technique for the parts manufactured by LMD. As a result, the microstructure can be improved. Phase formation and the microstructure evolution during each hydrogen content were studied and evaluated."
1,Materials and experimental procedure,
2,Starting materials,"2.1 Starting materials In this experiment, the detail elements of Ti6Al4V and hydrogenated Ti6Al4V are shown in Table 1. The Ti6Al4V alloy powder is prepared by vacuum atomization with the size between 100 and 200 µm and its shape is similar to spherical which can enhance fluidity. Particularly, hydrogenated Ti6Al4V whose hydrogen content is 2.8 wt% has an irregular shape (as shown in Fig. 1) owing to the mechanically pulverized process.Ti6Al4V and hydrogenated Ti6Al4V have been mixed to obtain six kinds hydrogen concentration powder 0.0 wt%, 0.2 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 0.65 wt%, 0.8 wt% and 1.0 wt%, respectively. The morphology of Ti6Al4V-x wt% H is displayed in Fig. 2. It is necessary for alloy powder to be placed in vacuum drying oven for 4–6 h in order to improve its mobility. Substrate is rolled Ti6Al4V plate with 160 mm × 160 mm × 15 mm. Meanwhile, the surface of the substrate is sandblasted to remove the oxide and then scrubs it clean with ethanol before the experiment."
3,Optimum process parameter,"2.2 Optimum process parameter Firstly, Ti6Al4V samples are fabricated by LMD which is received from 3D systems LMD 8060. The single-track samples are reported to have different processing parameters such as the scanning velocity (v), laser power (P) and feeding rate (Vp). Based on scanning velocity, laser power and feed rate, an orthogonal single-track experiment with 3 factors and 3 levels has been conducted, as shown in Table 2. Laser power and scanning speed have an impact on the deposit height (H), width (W), and penetration depth (D), as shown in Fig. 3(a–b) respectively. When the heat input increases, the deposit width, height and penetration depth increases in varying degrees at the same time. Deposit width increases from 2.66 mm to 3.28 mm. Deposit height and penetration depth increases by 0.15 mm and 0.3 mm, respectively. On the contrast, deposit width, height and penetration depth decline while scanning speed increases. Furthermore, scanning speed has a great influence on the deposit width which drops from 3.22 mm to 2.66 mm. This phenomenon manifests that the rise of scanning speed will make deposit width, height and penetration depth drop."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Multi-layer deposition is characterized by the following method. The cross section perpendicular to build direction is ground until 2000 grit and polishes the samples by diamond grinding paste with 2.5 w particle size, chooses Kroll’s reagent (HF: HNO3: H2O=1:2:7) corrosion specimen surface 5–10 s, washes them with alcohol after corrosion, observes the microstructure under the Zeiss optical microscope. SmartLabTM3KW device is used to obtain X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns by using Cu- Kα radiation with continuous scanning in 10°/min at 40 kV between 20° and 80°, 2θ values. Prepared samples’ cross-sections 10 mm × 10 mm × 0.5 mm were analyzed using H-800 and C−100 X to obtain Transmission electron microscope (TEM) patterns at −30 °C."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Morphology of optimum process under different hydrogen,"3.1 Morphology of optimum process under different hydrogen According to single-track experiments, optimum parameters of Ti6Al4V-x wt% H is selected to fabricate samples. Due to the escape behavior of hydrogen from alloy powder during heating, the hydrogen in the sample is easy to escape. Therefore, the evacuated quartz tube is filled with argon to prevent the escape of hydrogen and oxidation of the sample. By comparison with deposit height, width and penetration depth of Ti6Al4V-x wt% H, the optimum laser power, scanning speed and powder feeding rate have been selected, as shown in Table 3. Single-track macro morphology corresponding to optimum processing parameters is shown in Fig. 4. It can be found that the symmetry of morphology is favourable and heat affected zone (HAZ) is tiny. CG are existed in the middle part of the single-track sample, and the grains at the top are refined. The length of CG decreases and the width increases when hydrogen content increases. Finally, CG are transformed into similar equiaxed grain shapes. In Fig. 5(b), spacing hatch 1.7 mm demonstrates that lap joint forms well between two single tracks because contact angle is the same on both sides. While the single-track spacing is 1.4 mm showed in Fig. 5(a), the deposited layer height is unevenly distributed, and there is a significant difference between the two contact angles on both sides. Hence, it is easy to cause poor bonding and much defects such as holes and cracks. The microstructure of overlapped layer is similar to single track whose CG grows perpendicularly along building direction, and the grains are refined near the edge area."
7,Microstructure of as-deposited and dehydrogenation,"3.2 Microstructure of as-deposited and dehydrogenation Microstructure morphology of hydrogenated titanium alloy samples manufactured by LMD is shown in Fig. 6. The microstructure is composed of α′ and β-prior grain boundary. The coarse CG penetrates through several layers where the β grains boundary is clearly visible. With the increase of hydrogen content, the size of CG becomes smaller. When the length of CG becomes shorter, the width increases. Finally, part of coarse CG is transformed into small grains with a large number of acicular martensite. At the same time, with the increase of hydrogen content, the β phase transition temperature decreases, so that more bcc β phase is retained when the temperature is cooled to room temperature. The microstructure of the alloy after deposition and hydrogen removal is shown in Fig. 7. After the hydrogen in depositing samples is removed by vacuum annealing, it is observed that the microstructure is all net basket microstructure, which shows that the α-phase in β grains were small and interlaced. There is almost no such large lamellar martensite, but acicular and narrow lamellar martensite. Compared lamellar martensite of deposition state, the strip and acicular microstructure increase after hydrogen removal."
8,Microstructure evolution of heat treatment and heat treatment+dehydrogenation,"3.3 Microstructure evolution of heat treatment and heat treatment+dehydrogenation α + β/β phase transition temperature of deposited samples is measured by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimeter). Peak temperature Tp is phase transition temperature [35] because the phase transformation of titanium alloy is carried out within a certain temperature range, the optimum heat treatment process for room temperature plasticization of the hydrogenated titanium alloy is Tp+ 10 °C [36]. The whole heat treatment process includes heat preservation under the temperature which is approximately Tp+ 10 °C for 30 min and water quenching. The hydrogen removal is carried out under 700 °C for 2 h in a vacuum whose internal pressure is 5 × 10−3 Pa. The phase transition temperature curve of the different hydrogen content is shown in Fig. 8. The evolution curve of the deposited sample phase transition point demonstrates that β-phase transition temperature decreases with the increase of hydrogen content. When the hydrogen content is 0.65 wt%, β transition temperature reach to 900 °C steadily and phase transition point decreases by 80–100 °C. The microstructure of Ti6Al4V with different hydrogen content after heat treatment, hydrogen removal and deposited state are composed of CG, which penetrates multiple layers and grows up perpendicular to the build direction. At the same time, there is much martensite in prior β CG after solution and quenching because of rapid cooling. Due to different orientation of crystallography, the macrostructure showed alternate growth. The microstructure of Ti6Al4V-0 wt% H is shown in Fig. 9. In Fig. 9(a), there is a large number of lamellar martensite in deposition state. After solution and quenching, the microstructure is mainly composed of needle-like fine martensite. As shown in Fig. 9(b), after dehydrogenation treatment, the microstructure reveals almost no thick martensite, but needle-like or smaller narrow plate martensite. After heat treatment and dehydrogenated for 0 wt% H, the fine needle-like martensite widens, which presents the needle-like narrow plate strip martensite microstructure. The microstructure is mainly acicular fine martensite after solution quenching treatment in Fig. 9(c). When the heat treatment is completed, the alloy experiences hydrogen removal treatment again, which leads to the wider fine needle-like martensite. As shown in Fig. 9(d), compared to Fig. 9(c), it shows needle-like narrow lath martensite. Fig. 10 shows XRD pattern of Ti6Al4V-x% H under two different conditions. Fig. 10 (a) reveals the influence of hydrogen content on the deposition state. With the increase of hydrogen content, the diffraction peak gradually shifts to a small angle. The reason is that the increase of hydrogen causes distortion of the crystal lattice, and the diffraction angle decreases. During the laser melting deposition process, due to the extraordinary metallurgical environment, that is, rapid heating and rapid cooling, coarse columnar grains will form. On the one hand, the hydrogen in the powder will escape at high temperature, so that a large amount of hydrogen does not penetrate into the sample. Therefore, there is not enough hydrogen to transform the α phase into the β phase. In addition, non-diffusion phase transformation occurs owing to rapid cooling which results in a large amount of α' acicular martensite. When cooled to room temperature, α' and α are retained. There is little β phase, and no β peak can be detected in XRD, as shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10 (b) is the XRD pattern of deposit samples after solution and quenching. The alloy is composed of α and martensite α'. Microstructure of Ti6Al4V-0.5 wt% H alloy is further analyzed and determined by TEM under three states: deposited, heat treatment, heat treatment and dehydrogenation. Fig. 11 suggests that there are hcp α-Ti and bcc β-Ti which correspond to the diffraction pattern in Ti6Al4V-0.5 wt% H. It can be observed a lot of dislocation and phase are visible in Fig. 11 (a). In Fig. 11 (b), brightfield area A, B corresponds to diffraction pattern A, B respectively. Fig. 11 (c) and (d) shows the phase morphology and the corresponding electron diffraction pattern of Ti6Al4V-0.5% H after solution quenching. Selected area diffraction patterns (SADPs) of B region is hcp α-Ti, and the A area is the fcc structure of δ (TiH2) compound, for its SADP for δ area [0 1 1] axis, whose high resolution electric mirror as shown in Fig. 11 (d). After solution and quenching, a hydride has been found and the size of hydride is a few nanometers. The reason for the generation of nanometer hydrides are as follows. On the one hand, hydrogen is a stabilizing element of β-Ti. When the temperature is high, hydrogen exists in β-Ti as a solution. Moreover, rapid cooling in the LMD process can restrain the growth of hydrides. On the other hand, hydrogen element will cause the lattice distortion and internal stress to a certain extent, which will result in internal stress concentration. At the same time, because hydrogen is very sensitive to stress concentration, it is easy for hydrogen to gather in the stress region and quickly add the lattice distortion rate. Thus, it greatly promoted hydrogenation partial polymerization and hydride generation. When the temperature rapidly cooled down, hydride is retained. Fig. 11 (e) and (f) shows the microstructure in detailed of Ti6Al4V-0.5% H after heat treatment and dehydrogenation. During the hydrogen removal process, δ hydride disappeared. A series of phase transitions happens, such as δ→α + H, αH→α + H, and βH→α + β + H. Hydrogen has a high solubility in Ti6Al4V. When the hydrogen content exceeds the solid solubility of the β phase, hydride δ will be formed. Since hydrogen is reversible in titanium alloys, hydrogen will escape as following process: δ→α + β + H. In the process of hydrogen removal in a vacuum, the metastable phase will decompose and the hydride δ will also be transformed into the α + β phase at the same time. Therefore, the formation of hydride δ will not affect the dehydrogenation."
9,Microstructure characteristics of multilayer hydrogenated titanium alloy,"3.4 Microstructure characteristics of multilayer hydrogenated titanium alloy The microstructure of solution and quenching is shown in Fig. 12. After solution and quenching, a large number of martensite appeared, and the primary β grain boundary gradually disappeared. After solution quenching and dehydrogenation by vacuum anneal, the morphology is shown in Fig. 13. This macrostructure is composed of vast CG that penetrates through multiple deposited layers and grows in an epitaxial direction perpendicular to the build direction. With the increase of hydrogen content, grains are equiaxed at the bottom area firstly. The more hydrogen content, the finer grains appear. On the one hand, with the heat accumulation gradually during the depositing process, the capacity of heat transfer in the molten pool decreases, which results in temperature rising in the molten pool and temperature gradient reducing. Thus, it made solidification rate decline. On the other hand, hydrogen promotes elemental diffusion in molten pool and accelerates grain nucleation, so that it can promote grain refinement. The hydrogen atom diameter is small and has a large liquid–solid phase line range, which makes part of hydrogen atoms are adsorbed at the liquid-solid interface and inhibits growth solid phase growth. At the same time, hydrogen enhances the self-diffusion ability of titanium atoms and the solute atoms, which theoretically reduces the nucleation activation energy of alloy melts. As shown in Fig. 13, there are a great number of coarse CG describes by the white dashed line. One phenomenon can be observed that the size of CG becomes finer with the increase of the hydrogen content. From 0.0 wt% H to 1.0 wt% H, it showed that the number of finer grains increases and the scope of refinement is getting wider as shown by the black dotted line. Not only the grains at the bottom are refined, but the grains of middle area are also refined along the bulid direction. Compared to other hydrogen contents, the refinement effect is the most obviously when the hydrogen content is 1.0 wt%. The grains size is calculated through the software Nano Measure 1.2. Average area of grains is 2.35 mm2 when the hydrogen content is 0 wt% H. Compared the average area with 0 wt% H, the 1.0 wt% H decreased and its average area is 0.706 mm2. Grain refinement occurs in the process of hydrogen removal. During the process of hydrogen removal, the decomposition of metastable phases δ and α' will refine the microstructure and grains. In fact, the actual hydrogen content is much lower than the nominal hydrogen content. This is because during the deposition process, when the hydrogen in the powder is subjected to a high-energy heat source, the hydrogen will escape, which will lead to a weak refinement effect. According to Table 4, it can be seen that hydrogen after deposition has escaped for about 10 times compared to before deposition, which is the reason why the coarse CG are weaker in refinement."
10,Microstructure refinement mechanism of hydrogenated titanium alloy,"3.5 Microstructure refinement mechanism of hydrogenated titanium alloy With the increase of hydrogen content, coarse CG refined. The grain refinement process is shown in Fig. 14. When Ti6Al4V and hydrogen Ti6Al4V powder are melted by laser, a molten pool is formed at the point on which laser focus. At the same time, hydrogen element in the hydrogen Ti6Al4V diffused in the form of hydrogen atoms. A large number of hydrogen atoms firstly gathers at the grain boundary. Then, hydrogen atoms preferentially complete short-range diffusion at grain boundaries and grain boundaries gradually become blurred. The hydrogen concentration in these two places first reaches saturation, and then hydrogen atoms diffuse into grains through the lattice to complete the diffusion. Due to the microscopic radius of hydrogen atoms, they are solid solution in the alloy as interstitial atoms. When the hydrogen concentration exceeds the solid solubility, fcc hydride δ is formed. The refinement mechanism includes the following aspects: (1) Hydrogen reduces the β-Ti transition point. After the phase transition point is lower, more β-Ti can be retained at room temperature during the solidification process. (2) The hydrogen element promotes the diffusion of V element in the β phase. (3) When the hydrogen content increases and exceeds its solid solubility, hydrides will precipitate. These hydrides will become new nucleation points which will accelerate nucleation. When hydrogen is added to Ti6Al4V, αH and βH are formed. Since the solubility of hydrogen in the α phase is relatively small, δ will be precipitated in αH, that is, αH→δ. When the temperature is heated to the β phase region, αH and δ will dissolve in βH. At this time, the liquid phase is βH. When the temperature cools in the β phase region, αH precipitates in the β grains boundary and inside the β phase. A large amount of βH is transformed into αH, which makes the β grains boundary gradually disappeared. However, due to the presence of the V element, a part of βH remains. During the cooling process, βH transforms into δ, and the precipitation of δ causes the volume to expand and generate internal stress. The strain caused by the stress induces the production of martensite α'. In addition, a larger cooling rate produces a larger degree of undercooling which promotes the production of martensite. Therefore, when the temperature is cooled to room temperature, β, α, δ and α' are present."
11,Conclusions,"The effect of different hydrogenation on microstructure is investigated in this paper. It is found that optimum process parameters of single-track according to the morphology. On the other hand, there is a tendency that grain will be refined and decrease phase transition temperature when hydrogen content increased. Furthermore, after solution and quenching, there is a lot of martensite in the microstructure due to rapid cooling process. By analysised all above, some conclusions can be draw: 1. Different hydrogen content has a different process, this paper found the optimum process parameter for six kind of hydrogen content. When hydrogen content is 0.0 wt%, the optimum process parameter is laser power 1800 W, scanning speed 600 mm/min, feed rate 6.0 g/min. The optimum process parameter of 0.2 wt% H is laser power 1800 W, scanning speed 600 mm/min, feed rate 6.0 g/min. 0.5 wt% H has identical parameter corresponding to 1800 W, 600 mm/min, 5.4 g/min. 0.65 wt% H is corresponding to 1500 W, 600 mm/min, 6.0 g/min. 0.8 wt% H is the same as 1.0 wt% H like 1500 W, 480 mm/min, 5.4 g/min. 2. With the increase of hydrogen, the length of CG gets shorter, and finally changed into irregular coarse equiaxed grains. After solution and quenching, primary β boundary gradually disappeared and a large number of martensite microstructure were generated. 3. After heat treatment + hydrogen removal, it was observed that the grains equiaxed phenomenon gradually appeared in the bottom area. With the increase of hydrogen content, the grains of middle area are also refined. When hydrogen content is 1.0 wt%, the grain refinement effect is obvious."
