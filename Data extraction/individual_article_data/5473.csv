0,Introduction,"Supported Pt catalysts have been widely investigated for applications in the electrochemical and fine chemical industries [1,2]. A major challenge is the uniform dispersion of Pt of the catalyst support, which provides improved catalytic activity and selectivity and reduces the required amount of high-cost raw materials. There are various methods for fabricating highly dispersed supported Pt catalysts such as microwave irradiation, ion exchange, colloidal processes, poly processes, and deposition–precipitation [3–7]. Among them, deposition–precipitation is regarded as an efficient method for obtaining small particle sizes and high metal contents [7,8]. Many researchers have investigated the synthesis of nano-sized metal particles using stabilizers. According to the literature, carboxylic acid anions, such as sodium acetate, trisodium citrate, and sodium rhodizonate, can improve the uniformity of Pt nanoparticles by controlling the solution pH [3,5,9]. Other researchers have reported that highly uniform Pt nanoparticles can be synthesized by using polymeric stabilizers such as poly(vinylpyrrolidone), thiol-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), and sodium poly(acrylate) [10–12]. The catalytic activity and selectivity of supported catalysts are strongly affected by the particle size, distribution, and dispersion. Therefore, improved nano-sized supported catalysts are required to achieve better catalytic performance. Fossil fuels are the most commonly used resource for producing chemical products in modern society. Over the last decade, fossil fuel consumption has dramatically increased with the development of the chemical industry; thus, fossil fuel depletion is of concern. Recently, eco-friendly processes have been under continuous development to replace petroleum feedstocks and fossil fuel energy with solar power, wind power, and biofuels [13,14]. The most common biofuel is produced by the extraction of plants, and several researchers have attempted to realize the biological transformation of cellulosic biomass and biomass-derived carbohydrates [15,16]. d-Sorbitol, a common C6 sugar alcohol, is an attractive material with various applications in cosmetics, food additives, biofuels, and polymer production [17]. Moreover, d-sorbitol is used as an intermediate for the production of high-value-added materials such as 1,2-propanediol, ethylene glycol, n-hexane, and glycerol [16–20]. Generally, d-sorbitol is obtained from by hydrogenation of d-glucose over Ni/NiO, Ru/MCM-41, Ru/HYZ, Pt/SiO2, and Pt/C catalysts [16,18,21–24]. d-fructose and d-mannitol may be produced as byproducts depending on the characteristics of the catalyst and the reaction conditions. For hydrogenation, several factors must be considered including how hydrogen is adsorbed on the catalyst surface and resistance of the catalyst to leaching after the reaction. Although, d-glucose hydrogenation is most commonly performed using Ni-based catalysts, these catalysts exhibit dramatic deactivation and leaching problems. In this regard, Pt is more favorable as a hydrogenation catalyst than non-noble metals owing to its high activity and stability. Herein, we investigated nano-sized Pt catalysts on carbon supports prepared by a deposition–precipitation method with sodium propionate (SP) as a stabilizer. Carbon black (CB), multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were used as catalyst supports. The prepared Pt/C catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption and desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO chemisorption, field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), and Boehm titration. The catalytic activities of the prepared Pt/C catalysts were evaluated by liquid-phase hydrogenation of d-glucose. Moreover, the effect of the reaction conditions on d-glucose hydrogenation by the Pt/C catalysts was examined. We confirmed that SP as a stabilizer enhnced the dispersion of Pt in the Pt/C catalysts. The d-glucose conversion and d-sorbitol selectivity were increased with increases in Pt dispersion. The product selectivity was affected by the Pt loading and the reaction conditions such as hydrogen pressure, reaction temperature, and reaction time. The reaction conditions were optimized to obtain high d-glucose conversion and d-sorbitol selectivity."
1,Experimental,
2,Support pretreatment,"2.1 Support pretreatment CB (Black Pearl 2000, Cabot Corporation), MWCNTs (Applied Carbon Nanotechnology), and CNFs (Applied Carbon Nanotechnology) were functionalized by a chemical oxidation method. Briefly, the pristine carbon (1.0 g) was ultrasonicated and then stirred in a mixture of 4.0 M HNO3 (30 mL) and 4.0 M H2SO4 (30 mL) at room temperature for 2 h. After the functionalization process, the suspension was filtered and then washed with distilled water until the pH reached 5. The pretreated carbon supports were dried at 105 °C for 12 h."
3,Preparation of Pt/C catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of Pt/C catalysts The Pt/C catalysts, containing 5 wt% Pt, were prepared by a deposition–precipitation method. A Pt precursor solution was prepared by dissolving H2PtCl6·6H2O (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, 37.5 %) in 120 mL of distilled water. The aqueous Pt precursor solution was heated to 60 °C and different concentrations of SP (0–1 mmol/g) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0 %) were added. The Pt precursor solution was adjusted to pH 7.0 using 0.15 M NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, 97.0 %) and the pretreated carbon support was added to the solution, which was then stirred for 3 h. Reduction of the catalyst was carried out in the liquid phase using a 30 mL of 0.15 M sodium formate solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0 %) for 3 h. The suspension was then filtered and washed with distilled water. Each catalyst was dried at 105 °C for 12 h. The prepared Pt/C catalysts are denoted as Pt/X_SPY, where X is the carbon support and Y is the amount of SP in the solution in mmol/g (e.g., Pt/CB_SP0.1)."
4,Characterization of supports and catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of supports and catalysts The raman spectra were measured by using Raman spectrometer (DXR, Thermo Fisher Scientific lnc., UK) with excitation laser of 532 nm and maximum power of 10 mW. The crystal structures of the supports and the Pt/C catalysts were analyzed by XRD (D8 Focus, Bruker, Germany) at 50 kV/50 mA using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and pore sizes/volumes were determined based on N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics, USA). The contents of Pt were verified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; Agilent 5100 ICP-OES, Agilent Technologies, USA). The UV–vis spectra (Cary 100, Agilent Technologies, USA) of Pt precursor and Pt with SP as stabilizer measured at room temperature in the range of 200–400 nm. XPS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) measurements were performed using Al Kα radiation. The dispersion of Pt in each Pt/C catalyst was evaluated by CO chemisorption (ASAP 2020C, Micromeritics, USA). Prior to each measurement, the catalyst was degassed under vacuum at 150 °C for 6 h. The degassed catalyst (0.4 g) was then reduced under flowing H2 at 250 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, CO adsorption was allowed to proceed at 35 °C. The amount of adsorbed CO was evaluated by assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry between CO molecules and the Pt surface sites. The particle size and distribution of Pt in each Pt/C catalyst were analyzed by FE-TEM (JEM-2100 F, JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The average particle size was calculated using ImageJ based on 200 spherical Pt particles. Prior to the XRD and XPS measurements, all the Pt/C catalysts were pre-reduced by hydrogen (4 % H2 in N2, flow rate =300 mL/min) at 250 °C for 2 h."
5,Boehm titration,"2.4 Boehm titration The surface acidity of Pt/C catalysts were studied by Boehm Method [25]. Before the measurement, all Pt/C catalysts were dried at 105 °C for 24 h. The 0.5 g of Pt/C catalyst was added to 50 mL of 0.01 N NaOH aqueous solution. The samples were magnetic stirring for 24 h at room temperature and then filtered. The quantities of surface acid group on Pt/C catalysts were determined by back titration of 0.01 N HCl aqueous solution."
6,Hydrogenation of d-glucose,"2.5 Hydrogenation of d-glucose Liquid-phase hydrogenation of d-glucose was performed in a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave under vigorous stirring (1000 rpm). Prior to the reaction, each Pt/C catalyst was reduced with hydrogen (4 % H2 in N2, flow rate =300 mL/min) at 250 °C for 2 h. Then, 200 mg of the Pt/C catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of 1 wt% d-glucose aqueous solution, and this mixture was transferred into the autoclave. The reactor was sealed and purged with nitrogen to remove air, and then the reactor was purged with hydrogen to remove nitrogen. The sealed autoclave was heated to 130 °C and pressurized with hydrogen to 35 bar. Hydrogen was continuously supplied at the desired pressure throughout the reaction, which was allowed to proceed for 3 h. After completion of the reaction, reactor was cooled to room temperature and the catalyst and product were separated by filtration. The reaction products were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (Ultimate 3000, Dionex, USA) using a refractive index detector and a Waters Sugar-Pak I column (6.5 mm × 300 mm ×10 μm). The mobile phase was distilled water at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The d-glucose, d-sorbitol, d-fructose, and d-mannitol standards (Sigma-Aldrich) were analytical grade and used without purification. The conversion and selectivity were calculated as follows: C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = I nitial mole of D-glucose - f inal mole of D-glucose Initial mole of D-glucose × 100 S e l e c t i v i t y % = m o l e o f d e s i r e d p r o d u c t I nitial mole of D-glucose - f inal mole of D-glucose × 100"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of carbon supports and Pt/C catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of carbon supports and Pt/C catalysts The Raman spectra of the carbon supports are shown in Fig. 1 . The two fundamental bands observed around 1350 and 1590 cm−1 were identified as the G (graphite) band and D (disordered) band. The degree of defects on a carbon structure can be estimated using the intensity ratio of these two bands (ID/IG). The CNFs showed a higher ID/IG ratio (1.31) than the other supports, indicating that the carbon structure contained a high quantity of defects. In contrast, the lowest ID/IG ratio was obtained for MWCNTs owing to the high crystallinity of the graphite structure. The XRD patterns of the carbon supports and the Pt/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The carbon supports show a characteristic peak at 2θ = 25°, which corresponds to the (002) plane. All the prepared Pt/C catalysts showed characteristic peaks at 2θ = 40°, 46°, and 67°, which corresponded to the (111), (200), and (200) crystal faces of Pt. The intensities of the Pt peaks exhibited a clear dependence on the catalyst. On increasing the SP concentration from 0 to 1 mmol/g, the intensities of the Pt peaks gradually decreased, indicating that the Pt nanoparticles are highly dispersed on carbon support. The Pt/CB_SP0.5 and Pt/CB_SP1.0 catalysts showed smaller Pt peaks than the other catalysts. The Pt/MWCNT and Pt/CNF catalysts prepared using SP as a stabilizer showed similar results. The physical properties of the carbon supports and Pt/C catalysts are listed in Table 1 . CB had a larger specific surface area (1426 m2/g) and pore volume (2.0 cm3/g) than the other supports. After Pt loading, the specific surface area and pore volume of the Pt/C catalysts decreased owing to pore blocking. However, the Pt/CB catalysts exhibited larger specific surface areas and pore volumes than the other catalysts. The acid properties of the Pt/C catalysts were measured by Boehm titration. The quantitative results for the Pt/C catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The Pt/CB catalysts have higher surface acidities than the other catalysts. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the Pt precursor with SP added as a stabilizer are shown in Fig. 3 . The H2PtCl6 precursor exhibited two adsorption peaks near 200 and 250 nm, which are characteristic of PtCl6 2− [26–28]. The addition of SP to the H2PtCl6 precursor resulted in a peak shift. In particular, a large shift from 250 to 260 nm with a corresponding increase in intensity was observed as with an increase of the SP concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 mmol/g. We suggest that complexes between SP and H2PtCl6 precursor were formed, resulting in the observed shift to longer wavelengths. As the SP concentration increased further from 0.5 to 1 mmol/g, the intensity of the peak near 260 nm decreased, suggesting that the amount of formed Pt complexes decreased. The XPS spectra of the Pt/C catalysts in the Pt 4f region are shown in Fig. 4 . All the Pt/C catalysts showed both metallic and ionic Pt species. The Pt/CB catalyst exhibited two peaks at 71.4 and 74.7 eV, corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2, respectively. As the SP concentration increased from 0 to 1 mmol/g in the Pt/CB catalysts, the Pt 4f peaks shifted towards higher binding energies. These shifts were related to electron transfer from Pt to the carbon support, which is indicative of strong interactions between the metal and support or Pt nanoparticles well dispersed on support [29,30]. In particular, the Pt/CB_SP0.5 and Pt/CB_SP1.0 catalysts showed significant shifts towards higher binding energies and similar results were observed for the Pt/MWCNT_SP0.5 and Pt/CNF_SP0.5 catalysts. These results suggest that the addition of SP as a stabilizer can improve the metal–support interactions, which may increase the catalytic activity and selectivity in d-glucose hydrogenation. The dispersion Pt in the Pt/C catalysts were determined based on CO chemisorption measurements. The Pt/CB catalyst had higher Pt dispersion (30 %) than the Pt/MWCNT and Pt/CNF catalysts, which is related to the physicochemical properties of the support such as specific surface area, pore volume, and surface defects. The CB support had a higher specific surface area and a more porous structure than the MWCNT and CNF supports. However, the CB support had a lower ID/IG ratio than the CNF support. It is well known that defects on the carbon surface act as functional groups to facilitate interactions between the metal and the support [31]. However, a high content of defects in carbon can lead to structural damage and decreased electrical conductivity, resulting in poor interactions between the metal and the support [32]. To confirm the effect of SP as a stabilizer, the concentration of SP was varied from 0 to 2 mmol/g in the Pt/CB catalyst. When the concentration of SP was increased from 0 to 0.1 mmol/g, the dispersion of Pt increased slightly from 30 % to 34 %. However, a significant increase of the dispersion of Pt from 34 % to 59 % was observed with the increase of the SP concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 mmol/g. However, at SP concentrations higher than 0.5 mmol/g, the dispersion of Pt remained similar at 58 %. We suggested that SP acts to control the nucleation and growth of the Pt particles. Generally, the H2PtCl6 precursor exists in an anionic state of PtCl6 2− [28,33]. The particle size and dispersion of Pt are determined by nucleation of Pt nanoparticles, which is affected by several factors such as pH, temperature, and reduction agent [8,27,34]. Prior to the formation of platinum hydroxide species on the carbon support, SP was dispersed among the Pt ions and some complexes formed between Pt ions and SP. The addition of SP as a stabilizer can increase the ionic strength, which reduces the aggregation between Pt particles or improves the metal–support interactions. The UV–vis spectra (Fig. 3) suggested the formation of Pt complexes following the addition of SP as a stabilizer. However, the peak intensity and position depended on the concentration of SP. In particular, the largest peak shift and highest peak intensity were observed at an SP concentration of 0.5 mmol/g, indicating that more Pt complexes were formed in aqueous solution. Additionally, the pH also has an important effect on the nucleation and growth of Pt. The use of SP as a stabilizer can stabilize the pH of the aqueous solution, indicating its important effect on the rates of nucleation and growth of Pt nanoparticles. Similar results were observed for the Pt/MWCNT_SP0.5 and Pt/CNF_SP0.5 catalysts. With the addition of SP as a stabilizer, the dispersion of the Pt/MWCNT and Pt/CNF catalysts increased from 20% and 23%, respectively, to 24% and 28% The FE-TEM images of the Pt/C catalysts and the corresponding particle size distributions of Pt are shown in Fig. 5 . The average particle size in the Pt/C catalysts increased in the order Pt/CB_SP1.0 (2.0 nm) < Pt/CB_SP0.5 (2.2 nm) < Pt/CB_SP0.1 (2.9 nm) < Pt/CB (3.3 nm) < Pt/CNF_SP0.5 (3.3 nm) < Pt/MWCNT_SP0.5 (3.8 nm) < Pt/CNF (3.9 nm) < Pt/MWCNT (4.0 nm). With the addition of SP as a stabilizer, the Pt/C catalyst exhibited smaller particle sizes and more uniform distributions of Pt."
9,Hydrogenation of d-glucose over Pt/C catalysts,"3.2 Hydrogenation of d-glucose over Pt/C catalysts The catalytic activities of the supports and prepared Pt/C catalysts were evaluated for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of d-glucose under 35 bar of H2 at 130 °C for 3 h, as summarized in Table 2 . We focused on two perspectives: the effect of the carbon support and the effect of SP as a stabilizer. Among the examined carbon supports, the Pt/CB catalyst showed higher d-glucose conversion (36 %) than the Pt/MWCNT and Pt/CNF catalysts owing to high Pt dispersion. However, the d-sorbitol selectivity decreased in the order of Pt/MWCNT (59.7 %) > Pt/CNF (58.3 %) > Pt/CB (50.2 %). Furthermore, the Pt/CB catalyst showed higher d-mannitol selectivity (11.2 %) than the Pt/MWCNT and Pt/CNF catalysts. The d-mannitol was produced by two pathways: the hydrogenation of d-fructose or isomerization of d-sorbitol. It has been reported that the surface acidity of a catalyst is related to the selectivity for d-sorbitol and d-mannitol, and that the formation of side products is dependent on several factors such as surface acidity, pH, pore volume, and Pt loading [35–38]. The Boehm titration results indicated that the Pt/CB catalyst had a higher surface acidity than the Pt/MWCNT and Pt/CNF catalysts. It has been reported that the epimerization of d-sorbitol to d-mannitol can occur in the presence of solid acids [37,38]. Therefore, we suggest that a higher surface acidity on the catalyst leads to increased selectivity for d-mannitol via the epimerization of d-sorbitol to d-mannitol. The effect of the SP concentration on the catalytic activity and selectivity was investigated using the Pt/CB catalysts. As the SP concentration increased from 0 to 0.5 mmol/g, the d-glucose conversion and the d-sorbitol selectivity increased from 36 % to 50 % and from 50.2%–65.8%, respectively. Thus, an increase in Pt dispersion led to an increase in d-glucose conversion and d-sorbitol selectivity. However, compared with the Pt/CB_SP0.5 catalyst, the d-glucose conversion and d-sorbitol selectivity are decreased for the Pt/CB_SP1.0 catalyst, suggesting that excess SP is not exactly removed on catalyst surface. Several researchers have reported how the presence or absence of a stabilizer on the catalyst surface affects the catalytic activity [35,36]. During catalyst preparation, the concentration of SP used for the Pt/CB_SP1.0 catalyst was two times higher than that used for the Pt/CB_SP0.5 catalyst. Although the catalysts were washed several times with deionized water and subjected to heat treatment under H2, it was difficult to remove excessive SP that was chemically adsorbed on the catalyst. Thus, we suggest that the existence of SP chemically adsorbed on the catalyst surface led to increased d-fructose and d-mannitol selectivities for the Pt/CB_SP1.0 catalyst. The not-identify materials are observed in all catalysts. The degradation of sorbitol resulted in the formation of by-products such as glycerol, propane-1,2-diol, C4 sugar alcohols [39,40]. The effect of the Pt content (0.1–5 wt%) on d-glucose hydrogenation over Pt/CB_SP0.5 catalysts was investigated under 35 bar of H2 at 130 °C for 3 h, as shown in Fig. 6 . The 0.1−5 wt% of Pt/CB_SP catalysts have high Pt dispersion. The d-glucose conversion and d-sorbitol selectivity increased with the increase in Pt loading. As the increased of Pt loading from 0.1–3 wt%, the d-glucose conversion is slightly increased from 9 to 30 %. However, the d-sorbitol selectivity is largely increased from 0 to 50.7 %. d-sorbitol is produced via two pathways: isomerization of d-glucose to d-fructose or direct hydrogenation of d-glucose to d-sorbitol. At low Pt contents, d-fructose is the predominant product, which indicated that isomerization of d-glucose to d-fructose occurred at low Pt contents. However, at high Pt contents, the d-sorbitol and d-mannitol selectivities gradually increased. Furthermore, at higher Pt contents, more d-sorbitol was produced than d-fructose. The d-mannitol and non-identify materials selectivity are slightly increased with increase of Pt loading. The highest d-glucose conversion and d-sorbitol selectivity were obtained at 5 wt% Pt loading, which concluded that increasing the number of Pt sites increased d-glucose conversion and d-sorbitol selectivity. The effect of the reaction temperature (110–150 °C) on d-glucose hydrogenation over the 5 wt% Pt/CB_SP0.5 catalyst was investigated under 35 bar of H2 for 3 h, as shown in Fig. 7 . The d-glucose conversion increased with the increase in reaction temperature from 110 to 150 °C. In contrast, the d-sorbitol selectivity gradually decreased. The d-fructose, d-mannitol, and non-identify materials selectivity gradually increased, which indicated that the d-fructose, d-mannitol and not-identify materials were more formed at higher temperature by isomerization and degradation [41]. Therefore, an optimum reaction temperature of 140 °C was selected for further study. The effect of the hydrogen pressure (15–55 bar) on d-glucose hydrogenation over the 5 wt% Pt/CB_SP0.5 catalyst was investigated at 140 °C for 3 h, as shown in Fig. 8 . As the hydrogen pressure increased, the d-glucose conversion gradually increased owing to the high concentration of dissolved hydrogen. Furthermore, the d-sorbitol selectivity increased and the d-fructose selectivity gradually decreased. The d-mannitol and non-identify materials selectivity slightly increased. In the range of hydrogen pressure from 35 to 55 bar, the d-fructose selectivity was decreased from 30.1–6.1%. The d-mannitol was produced by hydrogenation of d-fructose or isomerization of d-sorbitol. The d-fructose more converted into d-sorbitol than d-mannitol at high hydrogen pressure. At hydrogen pressures greater than 45 bar, similar results were obtained. Therefore, 45 bar was chosen as the optimal hydrogen pressure. The effect of the reaction time (1–5 h) on d-glucose hydrogenation over the 5 wt% Pt/CB_SP0.5 catalyst was investigated under 45 bar of H2 at 140 °C, as shown in Fig. 9 . As the reaction time increased, the d-glucose conversion and d-sorbitol selectivity gradually increased. In contrast, the d-fructose gradually decreased, which is related to the formation of d-sorbitol. As the increased of reaction time, the d-mannitol and not-identify materials selectivity were increased. After 5 h, d-fructose was completely converted. Under the optimal conditions of 45 bar H2 at 140 °C for 5 h, 100 % d-glucose conversion and 89 % d-sorbitol selectivity were achieved. After the reaction, leaching of Pt from the catalyst was investigated. The used catalyst was separated from the reaction solution, which was then analyzed by ICP-OES for Pt leaching. No Pt was detected in the reaction solution, indicating that Pt was not leached."
10,Conclusion,"SP was used as a stabilizer to synthesize highly dispersed Pt/C catalysts. The dispersion of Pt depended on the type of carbon support (CB, MWCNTs, or CNFs) and the concentration of SP. The physicochemical properties of the carbon support affected the metal–support interactions, and the Pt/CB catalyst exhibited higher Pt dispersion than the Pt/MWCNT and Pt/CNF catalysts. Furthermore, the concentration of SP affected the formation of complexes between the Pt precursor and SP. Higher concentrations of SP prevented the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles by controlling the nucleation and growth of Pt nanoparticles. The Pt/CB_SP0.5 catalyst showed the highest Pt dispersion of 58 %. The catalytic activities of the prepared Pt/C catalysts were determined for liquid-phase hydrogenation of d-glucose. When the Pt dispersion increased, the d-glucose conversion increased. Furthermore, the selectivities of d-sorbitol and d-mannitol were affected by the surface acidity of the catalyst. The Pt/CB_SP0.5 catalyst provided both high d-glucose conversion and d-sorbitol selectivity; however, the reaction conditions (Pt loading, reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure, and reaction time) strongly affected the selectivity of the products. Under the optimal conditions of 5 wt% Pt, H2 pressure = 45 bar, T =140 °C, and t =5 h, 100 % d-glucose conversion and 89 % d-sorbitol selectivity were obtained."
