0,Introduction,"For the sustainable development of our society and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biofuels are gaining a lot of attention these days. In this regard, terrestrial biomass such as edible agricultural crops and lignocellulosic waste has been studied extensively for a last decade [1]. However, serious problems have arisen, i.e. increase in food price, carbon debt, and demands for irrigation [2,3]. On the other hand, aquatic biomass, in particular, microalgal biomass is now being considered technologically viable alternative energy source owing to the fact that it is free of the major drawbacks associated with terrestrial biomass [4]. Microalgal biomass can provide several different types of renewable biofuels, and these include biodiesel, bioethanol, and biogas. Currently most research is focused on biodiesel production from lipids extraction. However, Clarens et al. and Pierre et al. reported that fertilizers consumption, harvesting and oil extraction from microalgal biomass represent a high energy debt which jeopardize the overall interest of algal biomass from the results of life-cycle assessment or energy analyses [5,6]. To make more sustainable development of microalgal biodiesel industry and renewable energy production, the extraction of energy from residual biomass should serve as a way to maximize energy production from microalgal biomass [7]. Ehimen et al. and Yang et al. dealt with biogas recovery from lipid-extracted microalgal biomass residues (LMBRs), and also the co-generation of H2 and methane from Arthrospira maxima biomass was studied recently [8,9]. On the other hand, Bruno et al. emphasized that it is economically and energetically favorable to directly use microalgal biomass as a feedstock for anaerobic digestion (AD) without any process for lipid extraction, unless lipid content exceed 40% of cell weight [10]. AD is a series of biological reactions, consisting of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis, which finally converts organics to a valuable energy source in the form of methane (CH4) [11]. Furthermore, hydrogen (H2) which has high energy content, and its combustion only produces water as byproduct can be obtained in the acidogenesis step of AD by blocking H2-consuming methanogenesis [12,13]. In this way, Dark fermentative hydrogen production (DFHP) has been studied for a number of organic substrates especially rich in carbohydrates, but its process can be disturbed by many biochemical and operating parameters [14]. One of the most frequent factors of process inhibition or instability is the depletion of medial buffer capacity which leads to addition of external alkali source [15]. The co-fermentation with alkali-rich materials, such as livestock wastes, is also conducted for a feasible and easy to implement approach to avoid external adjustments of pH [16]. On the other hand, it is still veiled regarding DFHP from microalgal biomass which is the subject of this study although microalgal biomass could be feasible substrate [17,18]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the optimizing operational condition on DFHP from microalgal biomass without control of cultivation pH via statistical experimental design. This study provides not only the evaluation of interactive effects of substrate concentration and initial pH but also determination of the statistically optimum conditions based on experimental data of H2 yield from microalgal biomass. Moreover, pH, SCOD, and alkalinity were monitored in order to demonstrate trend of pH change profile during the confirmation test."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and feedstock preparation,"2.1 Seed sludge and feedstock preparation The seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester in a local wastewater treatment plant. The pH, alkalinity, and volatile suspended solid (VSS) concentration of the sludge were 7.6, 2.83gCaCO3/L, and 5.5g/L, respectively. The sludge was heat-treated at 90°C for 20min and then cooled to room temperature in attempt to harvest only spore-forming anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium sp. [19]. Chlorella vulgaris (a freshwater species) was used as a feedstock for this DFHP experiment. Microalgal biomass was kept at 4°C before use. The total chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of microalgal biomass was 1.4g COD/g dry cell weight. The portions of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, ash, and moisture of microalgal biomass were 38.8g/100g, 49.6g/100g, 0.7g/100g, 9.0g/100g, and 1.9g/100g, respectively."
3,Experimental design,"2.2 Experimental design A CCD with Design-Expert (Stat-Ease, Inc., USA) software was employed to find the optimum conditions. The experimental design consists of factorial runs (four experiments), axial runs (four experiments), and center runs (three experiments). Hydrogen production yield was chosen as a response variable, while substrate concentration and initial pH were employed as independent variables shown in Table 1 . The response was fitted using a polynomial quadratic equation to correlate it to the independent variables. The general form of the predictive polynomial quadratic equation is shown below. (1) Y = b 0 + ∑ i = 1 k b i x i + ∑ i = 1 k b i i x i 2 + ∑ i = 1 < k ∑ j = 2 k b i j x i x j where Y is the predicted response, x denotes the independent variables, and b is the coefficient."
4,Batch fermentation,"2.3 Batch fermentation A total of 11-batch test sets were carried out in series using 250mL serum bottles at various conditions as listed in Table 1. The working volume was 100mL and the bottles were seeded with heat-treated anaerobic sludge up to 30% of the working volume, and filled with a specified amount of untreated microalgal biomass with tap water. Before purging with N2 gas to provide an anaerobic condition, the initial pH was adjusted by adding either 3N KOH or 3N HCl solution. All batch tests were conducted in a shaking incubator at 35°C and 150rpm, which were carried out in triplicate. The reactor and experimental procedure employed for the confirmation test were the same as those used for the batch test."
5,H2 production analysis,"2.4 H2 production analysis The produced biogas was adjusted to the standard conditions of 0°C and pressure (760mmHg) (STP). Cumulative H2 production curve was described by the following modified Gompertz equation [20]. (2) H ( t ) = P · exp { − exp [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H(t), cumulative H2 production (mL) at cultivation time t (h); P, ultimate H2 production (mL); R m, H2 production rate (mL/h); λ, lag-phase time (h); and e, exp(1)=2.71828. To calculate the H2 production, the mass balance (given by Eq. (3)) was evaluated using the headspace measurements of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced at each time interval. (3) V H , i = V H , i − 1 + C H , i ( V G , i − V G , i − 1 ) + V H ( C H , i − C H , i − 1 ) where V H,i and V H,i−1: cumulative H2 gas volumes at current (i) and previous (i −1) time intervals; V G,i and V G,i−1, total biogas volumes in the current and previous time intervals; C H,i and CH,i−1: the fractions of H2 gas in the headspace of the bottle measured using gas chromatography in the current and previous intervals; and V H, the total volume of headspace in the reactor [21]."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods To determine the H2 content in the biogas, a gas chromatography (GC, Cow Mac series 580, Gow-Mac Instrument Co., USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 1.8m×3.2mm (inside diameter) stainless-steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A with N2 as a carrier gas was employed. The operational temperatures of the injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 90, and 50°C, respectively. The concentrations of organic acids (VFAs, C2–C6) and lactic acid were measured by a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (Finnigan Spectra SYSTEM LC, Thermo Electron Co.) using an ultraviolet (210nm) detector (UV1000), Thermo Electron and an 100×7.8mm Fast Acid Analysis column (Bio-Rad Lab.) with 0.005M H2SO4 as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. Alphatic alcohol was determined using another HPLC (DX-600, Dionex) with an electrochemical detector (ED50A, Dionex) and a 250×9mm IonPac ICE-ASI column (Dionex) with 50mM HClO4 as a mobile phase. The liquid samples were injected to both HPLCs after pretreatment with a 0.45μm membrane filter. COD, pH, and alkalinity of the samples were measured according to Standard Methods [22]. Chemical components of microalgal biomass were such as carbohydrate, protein, lipid, and ash were analyzed by the Korea Food Research Institute according to Korean Food Standards Codex 2009 and Kjeldahl method [23–25]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Optimization of substrate concentration and initial pH,"3.1 Optimization of substrate concentration and initial pH In order to optimize operational key parameters and to evaluate their interactive effects on DFHP, RSM with CCD was employed. From the overall performance undertaken as described in Table 1, it appears that two key parameters affected lag period and H2 production rate as well as H2 yield. It is well known that pH is one of the most important parameters in DFHP, as it affects hydrogenase activity, metabolic pathways, and lag periods [26,27]. In line with this, the results presented in Table 1 indicate that the lag period was affected by the initial pH when the substrate concentration was kept constant. However, at the same initial pH, the substrate concentration affected the lag period. These results indicate that the substrate concentration and initial pH might have interactive effects on DFHP. The maximum H2 yield of 30.74mL H2/g dcw was obtained at the center point condition of 60gdcw/L and initial pH of 7.0. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test the significance of fit of the second order polynomial equation for the experimental data as shown in Table 2 . An ANOVA for H2 yield indicated that the F-value was 21.79, which implies that the model was significant because model terms which have values of ‘Prob> F’ less than 0.05 are considered to be significant, while values higher than 0.1 are insignificant [28]. ANOVA of the fitting model indicated all parameters are significant for DFHP in this study. Based on ANOVA, Eq. (4) was obtained by using Eq. (2) to fit the experimental data of H2 yield. (4) Y = − 49.2476 + 0.0319 X 1 + 20.9738 X 2 + 0.0428 X 1 X 2 − 2.1982 E − 0.003 X 1 2 − 1.6172 X 2 2 where X 1 and X 2 are the substrate concentration (gdcw/L) and initial pH, respectively. Y is the corresponding H2 yield (mLH2/gdcw). The actual value versus the predicted value of H2 yield shown in Fig. 1 reveals satisfactory correlation between these values (R 2 =0.96). In addition, it demonstrated that a CCD with an experimental design could apply for the optimization of operational conditions in DFHP. The maximum predicted value of the H2 yield was 31.2mLH2/g dcw at the substrate concentration of 76gdcw/L and initial pH of 7.4. In Fig. 2 , two-dimensional contour lines and three-dimensional response surfaces are shown. In the design boundary, the response surface of the H2 yield had a clear peak, meaning that the key factors could be optimized inside the design boundary. As shown in Fig. 2, the H2 yield increased with an increase of substrate concentration up to 76gdcw/L and at initial pH 7.4. However, it decreased with further increases of these values. Fig. 2B shows an elliptical ridge running diagonally on the plot, reflecting that the substrate concentration and initial pH were slight interdependence, or a significant interactive effect on H2 yield."
9,Confirmation test at optimal conditions,"3.2 Confirmation test at optimal conditions In order to confirm the validity of the statistical experimental strategies and to gain a better understanding of H2 production, a confirmation test was conducted under the optimized conditions. Fig. 3 shows the cumulative H2 production from microalgal biomass. The curves were well fitted by the modified Gompertz equation with the R 2 value of 0.99. From the confirmation test shown in Table 3 , H2 yield of 30.7mLH2/g dcw was achieved, which was close to the predicted H2 yield of 98%. The distribution of metabolites formed during DFHP could be a crucial signal in assessing the efficiency of H2-producing cultures. The main effluent organic acid fractions were 21% acetic acid (2370mg COD/L) and 57% butyric acid (6420mg COD/L) which are accompanied by H2 production [29,30]. These results indicate that optimization of key factors was successfully achieved by RSM with CCD for enhanced H2 production from microalgal biomass."
10,pH and alkalinity during fermentation,"3.3 pH and alkalinity during fermentation As DFHP is always accompanied by organic acid production, it requires alkali addition during fermentation to maintain pH. Therefore, batch fermentation could be divided into two phases: (1) pH drop to the cultivation pH; and (2) injection of alkaline solution to control the cultivation pH [31]. Fig. 4 shows the time courses of pH change at different initial pH (Table 1) values during batch fermentations. It clearly shows that the initial pH of 9.0–9.8 was drastically decreased in the beginning period. Thereafter, pH maintained 5.5–6.5 during fermentation. Note that this pH range is favorable for Clostridium sp. [32,33]. In addition, at an initial pH of 7.0, a similar phenomenon was observed but not in trial no. 7 due to its low H2 yield (Table 1). In particular, under initial pH of 4.2–5.0, an increase of pH was observed and the pH was then maintained above pH 5.0, even though lag periods were longer than 10h. The pH variation might be resulted from the large amount of produced ions during hydrolysis of microalgal biomass. In order to verify the trend of the pH change profile, pH and alkalinity were monitored during the confirmation test, of which the results are shown in Fig. 5 . In the initial period (Fig. 5A), H2 was not produced, while pH decreased from pH 7.4–5.6, and then self-controlled during the confirmation test. On the other hand, with respect to the alkalinity (Fig. 5B), a continuous decrease was observed in the operation time of 10h. However, it increased (maximum alkalinity of 3800mg CaCO3/L) due to hydrolysis of microalgal biomass (Fig. 5C), which included a large amount of alkali anions (HCO3 −) in the cell via catalyzing the hydration of CO2 by carbonic anhydrase enzyme [17,34]. According to Kraemer and Bagley, in order to decrease the amount of alkaline needed, CH4-fermentation effluent with high alkalinity was recycled to the H2-producing reactor [35]. However, H2 production decreased by 20% even though alkali requirement was deceased by about 40%. Therefore, in the present study, although it involved a batch test, this approach would promote the practical viability of DFHP, since alkaline injection to maintain the cultivation pH was uneconomical."
11,Conclusions,"The present work focused on the optimization of key parameters for improving DFHP from microalgal biomass via the using RSM with CCD. A maximum H2 yield of 31.2mLH2/g dcw was estimated at the substrate concentration of 76gdcw/L and initial pH of 7.4. H2 yield of 30.7mLH2/gdcw was achieved through confirmation test, which was close to the predicted H2 yield of 98%. The main effluent organic acid fractions were acetic acid of 2370mg COD/L and butyric acid of 6420mg COD/L. Furthermore, by monitoring pH and alkalinity during the confirmation test, it was found that DFHP from microalgal biomass could be successfully achieved without the addition of alkaline solution due to increase in alkalinity level (max. 3800mg CaCO3/L) via cell hydrolysis. Further studies focused on application of various pretreatments to improve DFHP should be carried out."
