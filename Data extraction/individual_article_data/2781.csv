0,Introduction,"Climate change has become the greatest challenge humanity ever faced. Fossil-based energy sources produce greenhouse gases, which drives global warming. The 21st UN Conference of Parties set 2 °C increase of temperature by 2100 as the target. This compromise will require a shift of the global energy system and chemical industry toward more sustainable sources. An option to switch the energy and chemical industry to carbon neutrality is the production of fuel and chemicals from biomass via artificial photosynthesis. This approach has been listed in 2017 among the top 10 emerging technologies by the World Economic Forum and follows several EU countries committed to creating a bioeconomy. Converting solar energy into chemical bonds, in particular, solar fuels has attracted many researchers and industrialists because energy is produced and stored without greenhouse gas emission while satisfying our needs for large-scale storable energy. Light conversion to chemical energy is mediated by electron transfer processes, during which electrons catalytically convert preferentially cheap and abundant substrates (e.g., water) into high-energy fuel (e.g., H2) and the holes are refilled by complementary reactions (e.g., production of O2) [1]. Biomass is an appealing renewable alternative to water not only due to its sheer abundance but also because its photoconversion, in particular, the less used lignin fraction, can yield high-value chemicals and fuels [2]. An example is the conversion of veratryl alcohol (VOL) to veratraldehyde (VAL), a high-end chemical used in the food and fragrance industries, currently made from crude oil via methylation of vanillin [3]. Note that industries using VAL pay up to 100-fold if VAL is produced from biosources compared with the one produced from crude oil. From an industrial standpoint, biomass utilization shortens the time to practical implementation, increases process economic competitiveness, and improves sustainability. At a more fundamental level, lignin-based alcohol oxidation carries some advantages too, namely, it is a 2e− process and has virtually no by-products. Lignin peroxidase (LiP) is an enzyme extracted from wood white rot fungus (e.g., Phanerochaete chrysosporium), which adapts to oxidize a plethora of lignin moieties to valuable chemicals. LiP enzyme has a globular shape, with dimensions of about 50 × 40 × 40 Å3 (M = 41000 g/mol) with a six-coordinated heme iron active center [4,5]. Similar to other peroxidases, its catalytic proficiencies are intimately related to the oxidation and reduction of its iron central atom and porphyrin structure in the heme complex [6]. Similar to other peroxidases, the ferric LiP reacts with H2O2 to form an iron hydroperoxide intermediate [Fe(III)eOOH]. A subsequent oxidation of Fe(III) to Fe(IV) and the elimination of a water molecule takes place, which leads to the formation of the catalytically active [Fe(IV)=O] complex and a protein cation radical often situated in the porphyrin framework [6]. The [Fe(IV)=O] complex is thought to oxidize the enzyme substrate via reduction of the protein radical, forming a complex deficient of one electron [7], which can further oxidize a substrate molecule, returning the enzyme to the ferric state [8]. In the case of VOL oxidation, a mechanism including the formation of a veratryl cationic radical (VA+•) with [Fe(IV)=O] complex is largely accepted. For the second electron removal step, leading to VAL, there exist several proposed mechanisms. A common explanation is that VA+• is catalyzed further by LiP to VAL via a ping-pong mechanism [4,9–11] and follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics in terms of H2O2 [12]. As aforementioned, H2O2 is necessary to activate the enzyme. Handling concentrated H2O2 is undesirable due to the risk of explosion, making it desirable to generate it in situ. Note that the enzyme does not need high concentration of H2O2, but the chemical is often transported as such to minimize costs. A possibility is to generate it via photocatalysis with TiO2 [13], either via 2e− photooxidation of water {(E 0 red H2O2/H2O) = +1.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)} or 2e− photoreduction of oxygen {(E 0 red O2/H2O2) = +0.68 V vs RHE} [13]. From a potential perspective, the later is significantly easier to achieve. If successful, the in situ produced H2O2 could activate the LiP, mimicking the recent attempts to combine molecular sensitizers with enzymes to perform reduction reactions, e.g., carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (reduction of CO2 into CO) [14] or hydrogenases [15]. Herein, the photogeneration of H2O2 with TiO2-based catalysts and subsequent activation of LiP, leading to the production of VAL from VOL oxidation, are presented. The underlying process is O2 photoreduction with electrons originated from semiconductor band gap excitation."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All materials and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, except the TiO2-based catalysts. TiO2 anatase with an average particles size of 3 nm was provided by Sachtleben Chemie (Hombikat UV 100). eAu–TiO2 catalyst consists of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of ca. 30 nm diameters (P25 stands for a 75:25 mixture of anatase and rutile, respectively) loaded with ∼ 3-nm Au NPs. The catalyst was purchased from The World Gold Council (eAu–TiO2 reference catalyst #02–07; Süd Chemie Catalysts Japan Inc.). All solutions were prepared using double deionized water. Hydrogen peroxide test sticks were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Hydrogen Peroxide Test Kit, 1 mg/mL–100 mg/ML; Quantofix). Acetate buffer was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of 0.1 M sodium acetate and 0.1 M acetic acid, yielding a buffer with pH 4."
3,Enzyme activity studies with H2O2,"2.2 Enzyme activity studies with H2O2 The activity of LiP (Sigma-Aldrich) was assessed using the method described by Bosco et al. [16] Briefly, an enzyme stock solution containing 1.09 mg of LiP powder in 1 mL of acetate buffer (pH 4) was prepared and stirred for 15 min, yielding a stock solution with an LiP concentration of 26.6 μM. In a quartz cuvette, to 1.960 μL of acetate buffer (pH 4), purged with oxygen or argon gas for 10 min, we added 600 μL of 10 mM VOL aqueous solution, 200 μL of LiP stock solution, and 240 μL of 5 mM H2O2. The absorption at 310 nm (UV–vis spectra of VAL and VOL shown in supporting information Fig. S1) was monitored for 30 min with continuous bubbling of argon or oxygen. Absorption of blanks with no added H2O2 was also noted with the same procedure as described previously. Various solutions containing 1 mg/mL of TiO2 and eAu–TiO2 in 3 mL of acetate buffer (pH 4) were irradiated with a standard 25 W Osram UV light with the central wavelength at 365 nm (bulb light spectrum shown in supporting information Fig. S2) and tested for the formation of H2O2. Each solution was bubbled with oxygen for 30 s, before placing it on a platform as close as possible to a UV bulb and covered in an aluminum foil to minimize any unintended UV scattering. All tested solutions were irradiated for a maximum of 30 min."
4,Enzyme activity studies under illumination,"2.3 Enzyme activity studies under illumination A 2.2-mL solution containing 1 mg/mL of TiO2 or eAu–TiO2 dispersed in acetate buffer (pH 4) was placed in a quartz cuvette. To the catalyst solution, 600 μL of 10 mM VOL aqueous solution and 200 μL of LiP stock solution (LiP concentration in the reaction solution was 1.77 μM) were added, as prepared for the studies concerning enzyme activation. The solutions were irradiated with UV for 30 min under continuous bubbling of oxygen. Every 5 min, the cuvette was shaken to redisperse any NPs sediment. Immediately after turning off the UV lamp, the reaction solutions were tested for the presence of hydrogen peroxide using a peroxide test stick. Afterward, the reaction solutions were aliquoted in two 4-mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1000 G for 5 min to separate the catalyst from any products. The supernatant was collected in a new quartz cuvette and measured using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The amount of produced VAL was determined by measuring solution absorption at 310 nm. Quantification of VAL was performed by using the extinction coefficient 9300 M−1cm−1 (310 nm) [11]. The UV–vis spectra were acquired online with a setup equipped with a deuterium–tungsten–halogen light source (DH-2000- BAL, Ocean Optics) and a USB4000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics)."
5,Results and discussion,"Commercial LiP was tested for the formation of VAL from the oxidation of VOL. In Fig. 1 , the need for H2O2 to activate the enzyme is seen because only in its presence, VAL was detected. Note that LiP is a highly specific enzyme; thus, the only product formed is VAL, and the conversion of VOL correlates inversely with VAL formation. The formation of VAL on chemically triggered LiP with H2O2 was not affected by the presence of O2 in the solution (Fig. 2 ), confirming its passive role in the enzyme reactions. Therefore, it can be used a potential precursor for the in situ formation of H2O2 via photoreduction. Having confirmed that H2O2 presence is paramount to the LiP catalytic activity, we proceed by evaluating if the oxidant could be produced via photocatalysis. Table 1 shows the approximate amounts of H2O2 formed. Quantification was performed using Quantofix sticks (detection examples can be found in supporting information Fig. S3). Note that under the present conditions, electron–hole pairs are formed exclusively from TiO2 band gap excitation. Before analyzing the results summarized in Table 1, it should be mentioned that H2O2 was only detected when solutions were bubbled with oxygen, suggesting that H2O2 formation relates to oxygen reduction, not water oxidation [13]. The presence of Au NPs contributed to the increase of H2O2 production and its stabilization. Upon TiO2 band gap excitation, hot electrons are transferred to Au NPs [17] where adsorbed O2 [18] is catalytically reduced to H2O2. Note that oxygen adsorption on Au NPs is possible due to the depopulation of metal 5d-band via hybridization with 6sp states, a direct consequence from Au NPs formation [19,20]. The formation of H2O2 on Au via oxygen photoreduction without a sacrificial electron donor is unprecedented [21]. Preliminary studies have shown that gold is inactive in O2 hydrogenation to H2O2; however, it was found to improve palladium activity [22], contrasting with photocatalytic studies performed by Tsukamoto et al. [21] Our results suggest that gold's inability to hydrogenate oxygen might come from its incapability to activate hydrogen and extract electrons from the process. However, if such electrons are provided via photo or electro processes, the metal becomes very active. Another important observation is that the formed H2O2 in the Au–TiO2 system is constantly contrasting with TiO2. The observation is not related to photocatalysts deactivation because similar values were observed upon catalysts recycling. In the case of TiO2, it followed an initial formation of H2O2 promoted by high availability of O2 and lack of another easily reducible substrate. However, as time elapses, O2 concentration drops and hole population increases, which favor H2O2 oxidation back to oxygen. This also happens to some extent in Au/TiO2 but at a much higher level in H2O2 due to the increase of the charge-separated state lifetime and decoupling of the reduction reaction from TiO2. Both processes make it less likely that H2O2 is formed on TiO2 sites neighboring the oxidation sites, where it can be rapidly hydrolyzed to water via hot holes. Because no sacrificial electron donor was added to the solution, it is reasonable to assume that hot holes are filled by water oxidation process, resulting in the formation of molecular oxygen [1]. It is not our expectation that H2O2 on Au/TiO2 stagnates exactly at 10 mg/dm3; simply it is not possible to categorically quantify past this value due to the detection scale (0, 1, 3 10, 30, and 100 mg/dm3). Having demonstrated the formation of H2O2 via photocatalysis, the process was repeated in the presence of the LiP and VOL substrate. The outcome is presented in Fig. 3 . For comparison purposes, the LiP value with H2O2 addition is also plotted. As expected, the catalytic systems show no activity when the UV lamp was off. When UV irradiation was started, the photogenerated H2O2 was able to trigger VOL oxidation to VAL in LiP. However, this only occurs if the systems were bubbled with molecular oxygen, which confirms that the mechanism for H2O2 production is unaltered. The TiO2 system produces slightly less VAL after 30 min than the LiP system with the H2O2, which is easily understandable because this system produces lower amounts of H2O2, making it the limiting reagent. The Au–TiO2 system, however, produces significantly more VAL than any other tested system. This is due to the continuous in situ production of H2O2, which maintains enzyme activity. Please take note that in LiP + H2O2 case, H2O2 is consumed but not replenished, resulting in lowering of catalytic activity when its values become limiting. High activity requires adding more H2O2. The measured amounts of VAL after 30 min on reaction correspond to turnover numbers (TON) of 27, 22, and 39 for LiP + H2O2, TiO2+LiP w/light, and Au–TiO2+LiP w/light, respectively. Bosco et al. [16] reported a 20–25 TON for the enzyme system at 20 °C, but this increased significantly to 110 when temperature was raised to 41 °C (optimal reaction temperature for the enzyme). Note that experiments with FeCl3 and Au–TiO2+LiP w/light (FeCl3 replacing LiP) yielded no VAL formation. This was somehow foreseen because Fe IV is very unstable and needs protection, as provided by the enzyme structure. The obtained values are therefore consistent with the published one and confirm that the reported systems are indeed catalytic and not stoichiometric. The option to run the system at room temperature instead of optimal enzyme temperature reduces process energy consumption. Scheme 1 illustrates the reaction mechanism responsible for the phototriggering of LiP enzyme. The process is initiated by the absorption of a photon with enough energy to overcome TiO2 band gap (ca. 3.2 eV). This leads to the creation of an exciton, which can dissociate into an electron–hole pair. The free carriers are then transported to TiO2 surface, where they can participate in redox reactions. In the case of system containing gold, the electrons are rapidly transferred to the metallic NP due to the favorable position of its work function (φTiO2 = 4.0 eV; φAu = 5.0 eV) [17]. The electrons react with pre-adsorbed oxygen and protons, resulting in the formation of H2O2. The holes in the TiO2 valence band are refilled by water oxidation reactions. The photogenerated H2O2 activates the LiP in a similar fashion as proposed previously, leading to the formation of the active [Fe(IV)=O] complex and a protein cation radical often situated in the porphyrin framework [6]. The active enzyme converts the VOL via oxidation to VAL, according to the ping-pong mechanism [4,9–11]. The selectivity to VOL is expected because this is a substrate among the preferred LiP substrates [23,24]."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, we demonstrated that photogenerated H2O2 on TiO2 systems could be used to activate LiP enzyme, which subsequently oxidizes VOL to VAL. H2O2 is generated from oxygen photoreduction, a process significantly promoted when Au NPs are added to the photocatalyst. In situ H2O2 production enables perpetuation of the catalytic process, as well as it decreases potential safety issues around its handling in high concentration and improves overall green credentials of the process. We are confident that the proposed concept can be expanded to other suitable substrates and other peroxidase enzymes and even be converted into a flow process, which increases process intensification and scalability. In addition, the study contributes to the enhancement of the photobiocatalysis, which is an emergent field. Although we acknowledge that UV is less desirable radiation energy, it enabled us to establish a proof of concept. Shifting reaction into the visible domain is part of the ongoing research, which can be attained by semiconductor sensitization, for example."
