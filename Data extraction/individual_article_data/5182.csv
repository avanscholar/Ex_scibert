0,Introduction,"The preferred hydrogenation of CO group in the presence of a CC bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is of special interest for the chemical industry because the partially hydrogenated products, are used for the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes [1]. Nowadays, α,β-unsaturated alcohols are mostly produced through α,β-unsaturated aldehydes reduced by the NaBH4 or AlLiH4 in industry [2]. Although this method can get high yield of α,β-unsaturated alcohols, there are some serious drawbacks, namely, not only the reaction conditions are difficult to be controlled, but also a large amount of environment pollutants are generated [3]. The development of catalysts with high activity and high selectivity for these reactions is not only important from an industrial point of view, but also of fundamental scientific interest for catalysis because the thermodynamic and kinetic reasons favor the formation of the non-desired saturated aldehyde [4]. Intensive studies have been made to develop catalyst systems for selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, in which noble metal catalysts are most commonly employed in this reaction. According to reports in the literature, Pt-based catalysts are used mostly for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation [5–7]. For example, 80% selectivity to crotyl alcohol could be obtained on a Pt/ZnCl2/SiO2 reduced at 400°C [8]. Au catalysts supported on various oxides [9–12], as well as supported Ir [13–15] and Ru [16,17] catalysts are also applied for the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Ramos-Fernández et al. [16] reported that gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over a Ru/ZnO catalyst using RuCl3 as the precursor resulted in a catalytic activity of 80μmolgRu −1 s−1 at the initial state and a selectivity to crotyl alcohol of 80%. The catalyst showed better catalytic performance compared to a Ru/ZnO catalyst using Cl-free Ru precursor (Ru(acac)3) and the authors attributed the enhancement to a well controlled metal–support interaction. Also, bimetallic catalysts have been reported to improve the catalytic performance of the catalysts. Metals such as Fe [18], Sn [19–21], or Zn [22] were added to group VIII metal catalysts to inhibit the CC hydrogenation. This has been explained on the basis of alloy formation, which results in the weakening of the adsorption through the olefinic bond, and the presence of acid Lewis centers (the more electropositive metal atoms on surface) interacting with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond and favoring its hydrogenation [23]. Although great efforts have been paid, the main problem of the current catalyst systems employed for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde is rapid deactivation during the reaction. Usually the catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde suffer severe deactivation. For example, Pt catalysts in the literature lost about 80% of initial activity in 5h reaction [5,24–26]. Similar deactivation was also observed on Au [11,27] and Ir [13,14] systems. Generally, the catalyst deactivation is due to the strong adsorption of reactant/product molecules on the catalyst surface due to the interaction of the molecules with strong surface acid sites [28], and decarbonylation of crotonaldehyde to form CO molecules which could strongly chemisorb on the metal surface and poison the active sites [15]. As mentioned above, well designed catalysts with properly modified surface properties are required in order to improve the catalytic performance, especially the catalyst stability. In this study, a series of ZnO supported Ru–Ir bimetal catalysts were prepared and tested for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. It was found that the addition of Ir could effectively promote the activity and inhibit the catalyst deactivation to some extent. The promotion was discussed based on the interaction between Ru and Ir, which influences the electronic property and surface acidity of the catalyst. Besides, the deactivation was discussed based on the surface properties of the catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The ZnO support was prepared by a homogeneous precipitation method. In a typical procedure, a 0.2M aqueous solution of Na2CO3 was drop-wise added into a 0.2M aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O at 60°C in water bath until the precipitation was completed, then the precipitate was filtered and washed with plenty of deionized water, dried at 120°C for 12h and then calcined in air at 450°C for 2h. The final ZnO powder had a surface area of 11m2 g−1. The Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts were prepared by impregnating the ZnO support with aqueous solution of RuCl3 and H2IrCl6 for 12h. The nominal content of Ru in the catalyst was 3wt.%, and the value of x was the molar ratio of Ir/Ru (x =0, 0.125, 0.5 and 1). Excess solvent was removed by mild evaporation, and then the samples were dried at 60°C for 12h and then calcined at 400°C for 2h in air. The obtained precursor solids were denoted as Ru–xIr/ZnO(P). Before characterizations as well as prior to the reaction, the solids were reduced in ultra-pure H2 (99.995%) at 200°C for 1h and the final catalysts were denoted as Ru–xIr/ZnO. A reference Ir/ZnO catalyst with a nominal Ir content of 3wt.% was synthesized in a similar manner."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations Elemental compositions of the reduced catalysts were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis on an ARLADVANT’X Intelli Power 4200 scanning X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The results were analyzed using UniQuant non-standard sample quantitative analysis software. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytic X‘Pert PW3040 diffractiometer with Cu Kα radiation operated at 40kV and 40mA. The patterns were collected in a 2θ range from 10° to 75° with a scanning step of 0.014°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed on a JEM-2100F microscopy with a field emissive gun, operated at 200kV and with a point resolution of 0.24nm. The reduced samples were suspended in ethanol. The dispersion was then immersed for 10min in an ultrasonic bath in order to disperse the powder particles. Finally, one drop was placed on a Formvar/carbon copper grid. Various regions of the grid were observed and the particle sizes were measured from the observation of 100 particles. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using a VGESCALAB MK-2 spectrometer with Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV). The voltage and the power for the measurements were 12.5kV and 250W, respectively. The obtained spectra were treated by removing the background and then fitted to Lorentzian and Gaussian lines to obtain the number of components, peak position, and their areas. The adventitious C 1s line at 285.0eV was used as an internal standard. The acidic properties of the catalysts were measured by ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) on a home-made apparatus. 50mg of catalyst was filled in a quartz tubular reactor (i.d.=6mm) prior to the measurement, and was in situ reduced in a H2–Ar mixture (20mlmin−1, 10vol% H2) at 200°C for 1h. Then it was cooled down to 50°C. A flow of NH3 (20mlmin−1) was introduced for 30min. The gaseous or physisorbed NH3 was removed by purging Ar flow (30mlmin−1) at 100°C for 90min. Then the sample was heated to 700°C with a ramp of 10°Cmin−1. The desorbed NH3 was monitored continuously via a TCD detector. The total amount of NH3 desorbed was determined by reaction with an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid and back titration with sodium hydroxide solution. The sensitive indicator contains a mixture of 0.1% brom-cresol green ethanol solution and 0.2% methyl red ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 3:1. The CO chemisorption properties of the catalysts were measured by CO temperature-programmed desorption (CO-TPD) on a home-made apparatus. 100mg of catalyst was filled in a quartz tubular reactor (i.d.=6mm) prior to the measurement, and was in situ reduced in a H2–Ar mixture (20mlmin−1, 10vol% H2) at 200°C for 1h. Then it was cooled down to 30°C. A flow of CO (30mlmin−1) was introduced for 30min. Then the sample was heated to 500°C with a ramp of 10°Cmin−1. The desorbed CO was monitored continuously via a TCD detector. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) measurements were carried out in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with 6mm inner diameter. 50mg of the used catalyst was placed in the middle of the reactor, and O2 gas with a flow rate of 20mlmin−1 was fed into the reactor at rising temperature from 30 to 500°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. The gas at the outlet was analyzed on-line by mass spectrometry (Qic-20 Benchtop, Hiden Analytical). The mass numbers of 44 and 18 were selected to monitor the desorptions of CO2 and H2O, respectively. Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw RM1000 confocal microprobe under ambient conditions. The excitation wave length of laser was 514nm. The power of each laser was kept at about 3mW to prevent local heating effect and the resolution of the spectrometer was 1cm−1 with the diameter of the analyzed spot being ca. 1μm."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test Vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was performed in a fixed bed quartz tube (8mm i.d.) reactor at atmospheric pressure. 400mg of catalyst was loaded in the reactor with a thermal couple placed in the middle of the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. Before the catalytic performance test, the catalyst was reduced at 200°C for 1h in ultra-pure H2 flow (99.999%, 20mlmin−1) and then it was cooled down to 80°C. Crotonaldehyde in a trap set maintained at 0°C was introduced to the reactor by hydrogen flow (26mlmin−1) with a constant crotonaldehyde partial pressure (1062Pa). The reaction products and reactant were analyzed on line using a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-Wax column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm) capillary column."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Composition and phase of Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts,"3.1 Composition and phase of Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts Table 1 lists surface areas and element contents in the catalysts. It can be seen that the surface areas of the catalysts are not high (7.0–9.0m2 g−1), due to the surface area of ZnO support is 11m2 g−1. The Ru contents in the catalysts are similar (about 2.7wt.%) and the contents of Ir increase from 0.64 to 5.25wt.% with increasing Ir/Ru ratio. Meanwhile, the Cl contents in the catalysts increase because the use of RuCl3 and H2IrCl6 as the precursors In addition, from the results of XPS characterization, we can get that the percentage of M n+ also increase with Ir/Ru ratio. The catalyst surface analysis suggests that the reduction pretreatment prior to reaction could not reduced catalyst completely and remove the Cl species fully in the catalyst. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the reduced Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts. It can be seen that the diffraction peaks attributed to the ZnO support are very strong, indicating that the support is well-crystallized. As for the Ru/ZnO catalyst a weak diffraction peak (2θ =44.0°) due to metallic Ru0 is observed. For the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts a shoulder at 43.7° is detected and its intensity becomes stronger with increasing Ir content in the catalyst. This diffraction peak could be assigned to the formation of RuIr alloy [JCPS 65-5982, RuIr(101) at 43.7°], and the content of such RuIr alloy increases with Ir loading in the catalyst. Fig. 2 shows the representative TEM images of the reduced Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts. Based on these images, distribution of Ru and Ir particles are estimated. For the Ir/ZnO catalyst, the Ir particle size is about 2nm. For the Ru/ZnO catalyst, the agglomerization of the Ru particles occurs and the average size of the Ru particles are about 4–5nm. While for the Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts, it is found that the addition of Ir promotes the dispersion of the metals on the support surface, which results in a quite uniform particle size distribution of 2–3nm."
7,XPS analysis of Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts,"3.2 XPS analysis of Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts Fig. 3 presents the XPS spectra of the reduced Ru/ZnO, Ir/ZnO and Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalysts. Fig. 3a and b presents the Ir 4f XPS profiles for Ir/ZnO and Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalyst, respectively. After deconvolution, one can see that most Ir species present are in metallic state which corresponds to two XPS peaks at binding energy of 60.6–60.8eV(in Ir 4f7/2). Two Ir 4f7/2 signals, which correspond to an electron deficient iridium species (Ir n+), appear at 62.4–62.7eV. In addition, a shift toward lower binding energies of Ir0 and Ir n+ peaks in the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO is observed, compared to the values in the Ir/ZnO. Fig. 3c and d presents the Ru 3d XPS spectra of the Ru/ZnO catalyst and Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalyst, respectively. The largest peak at about 285.0eV in the spectra (Fig. 3c and d) can be assigned to C 1s peak, which is the carbon pollution peak from the instrument. Since the peaks of Ru 3d3/2 overlay the peaks of C 1s, only the peaks of Ru 3d5/2 are employed in the following discussion. The peaks at 279.9–281.1eV and 281.9–282.1eV are attributed to Ru0 and an electron deficient ruthenium species (Ru n+), respectively. These results suggest that even after reduction at 200°C for 1h before reaction, the catalyst still contains partially oxidized Ru n+ and Ir n+. Moreover, a slight shift to higher binding energies of the Ru species is detected in the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO, compared to the values of the Ru/ZnO. For the Ru/ZnO catalyst, the calculated surface Ru0/Ru n+ atomic ratio is about 4.41 while the ratio for Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalyst is about 2.93. As for the surface Ir0/Ir n+ atomic ratio, the values are 4.37 and 3.74 for the Ir/ZnO and Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalysts, respectively. The results indicate that there are more electron deficient Ru n+ and Ir n+ species in Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO than in Ru/ZnO and Ir/ZnO catalysts. More importantly, the fact that the binding energy of Ir shifts from 60.8eV (Ir0) in the Ir/ZnO catalyst to 60.6eV in the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO and meanwhile the binding energy of Ru shifts from 279.9eV (Ru0) in the Ru/ZnO to 280.1eV in the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO suggests charge transfer from Ru to Ir in the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalyst, which is probably due to the formation of RuIr alloy."
8,Surface acidity of Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts,"3.3 Surface acidity of Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts Fig. 4 shows the NH3-TPD profiles and the amount of surface acid sites of the Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts. It can be seen that the ZnO support has a weak NH3 desorption peak at around 425°C, suggesting that the ZnO support has some surface acid sites. For the Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts, desorption peaks in temperature ranges of 150–240°C (α), 250–300°C (β) and 380–470°C (γ) are observed, indicating the new Lewis acid sites are generated by the residual chlorine ions [5] and/or the presence of oxidized metal species on the catalyst surface. Besides, it is found that with increasing Ir content the desorption peaks generally shift to lower temperatures, suggesting that the strength of surface acid sites decreases as the Ir content increases."
9,Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde,"3.4 Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde Fig. 5 shows the catalytic behavior of the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalyst as a function of reaction time. All the catalysts in the current work were reduced under H2 at 200°C prior to reaction and then hydrogenation reaction was operated at 80°C. The products are crotyl alcohol (formed by hydrogenation of carbonyl CO bond), butyraldehyde (formed by hydrogenation of the CC bond), butanol (formed by hydrogenation of the CO and CC bonds) and others (mainly C3 compounds formed by decarbonylation and C8 compounds formed by polymerization) [28]. It can be seen that the initial conversion of crotonaldehyde is very high (about 99%), and it gradually declines with reaction time, reaching a conversion of 63.3% after 30h. Concerning the selectivity, it is found that the main products are crotyl alcohol and butanol, and the contents of other products such as butyraldehyde are very low (<5%). It is interesting that the selectivity to the desired crotyl alcohol rapidly increases in the first 5h and gradually reaches a relatively stable level after 10h reaction (about 90%). Meanwhile, the growth of the selectivity to crotyl alcohol is accompanied by the loss in the selectivity to butanol, implying that these two reactions (selective hydrogenation to crotyl alcohol and complete hydrogenation to butanol) are competitive. Although the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts employed in the current work still suffer deactivation, the catalytic results are higher than those reported in literatures. For example, in our previous work [15], 15% of crotonaldehyde conversion with a selectivity to crotyl alcohol of 82.2% was obtained on a 3% Ir/ZrO2 catalyst. For another more commonly used catalyst systems for this reaction such as supported Pt catalysts, they are much less active than the Ru–Ir/ZnO in the present work and deactivate very rapidly during the reaction (usually 50% loss in activity after 2h [25,29]). Taniya et al. [30] reported that 7.2% conversion of crotonaldehyde was obtained over a Pt/SiO2 catalyst after 10min reaction. Over a reduced 3% Ir/TiO2 catalyst [14], the initial conversion of crotonaldehyde was 80% with 79.8% selectivity to crotyl alcohol; however, the conversion declined rapidly after 500min reaction, resulting in 26.9% of crotonaldehyde conversion and 70% selectivity to crotyl alcohol. Fig. 6 shows the crotonaldehyde conversion and the selectivity to crotyl alcohol as a function of time on stream over the Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts. In all cases, three main reaction products are obtained: crotyl alcohol, butyraldehyde and butanol. As can be seen in Fig. 6A, all of the Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts exhibit very high initial catalytic activities (>97.0%) while that of the Ir/ZnO catalyst is low (45.1%). However, for each of the catalysts, an obvious change in conversion level is observed, i.e., all of the catalysts deactivate during the reaction. Nevertheless, the slopes of the catalyst deactivation are different. In order to better describe the stability of catalysts, the concept of deactivation rate is introduced, which is defined as (Convinit. −Convstead)/Convinit., where Convinit. and Convstead refers to the conversions obtained after 1 and 10h, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the deactivation rate of the Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts. From the table, it can be seen, the deactivation of the catalysts is significantly suppressed by the addition of Ir. Therefore, the addition of Ir effectively enhance the stability of the catalysts. Fig. 6B summarizes the steady-state selectivity to crotyl alcohol on the Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts. The Ru/ZnO catalyst has a selectivity to crotyl alcohol of 77.1% and the addition of Ir leads to higher selectivity, although there is a downward trend (from 90.6 to 83.6%) if further increasing the Ir/Ru ratio from 12.5 to 50%. For the Ru–xIr/ZnO catalysts, the selectivities to crotyl alcohol keep increasing during the reaction with the loss of selectivity to fully hydrogenated butanol (as can been seen in Fig. 6). This could be due to the fact that the initial activities of the Ru-based catalysts are very high (99%) and the formed crotyl alcohol could be subsequently hydrogenated to produce butanol [31]. Besides, it can be seen that the addition of Ir to the Ru-base catalysts could remarkably improve the selectivity to crotyl alcohol, indicating the positive effect of Ir in the reaction. Numerous literatures reported the bimetallic catalysts for hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, in which the second metal was added to group VIII metal to inhibit the CC hydrogenation. Ammari et al. [32] reported the formation of PtZn alloy was beneficial to the selectivity increase on Pt/ZnO catalyst for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, and they proposed that modification of the properities of Pt both from alloying to Zn and the Lewis acidity of the support change the adsorption mode of crotonaldehyde by favoring the binding of terminal oxygen of the molecule to the electronically modified platinum atoms. Taniya et al. [30] reported that PtSn alloy could suppress the interaction between the CC bond and Pt domain and thus the hydrogenation of CC bond could be inhibited. In the current work, the addition of Ir to the Ru/ZnO catalyst leads to the formation of RuIr alloy after reduction at 200°C, as evidenced by the XRD results (Fig. 1). Therefore, the formation RuIr alloy is beneficial to the selectivity to crotyl alcohol. The enhancement could be due to the structural and electronic changes in the catalyst with the addition of Ir. The interaction between Ru and Ir might modify the catalyst morphology, i.e., the dispersion of Ru species, as the TEM images of the catalysts (Fig. 2) clearly show that the addition of Ir could effectively promote the dispersion of Ru and increase the amount of active sites compared to the Ir–free Ru/ZnO catalyst. In addition, XPS results (Fig. 3) reveal charge transfer from Ru to Ir, and the charge deficient Ru species could interact with the carbonyl carbon in the crotonaldehyde molecule, similar to the cases of Pt and Ir catalysts [5,15]. Such a strong interaction between the charge deficient Ru species and the carbonyl carbon are beneficial for the selectivity to the desired crotyl alcohol. On the other hand, surface acidity of the catalysts could also affect the selectivity, which has been reported in the literature. Englisch et al. [31] found that Lewis acid sites enhanced the adsorption strength of the CO bond, thus resulting in the enhanced the selectivity to crotyl alcohol. So the appropriate strength of Lewis acids is critical for the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Ammari et al. [32] concluded that the Pt catalysts prepared from platinum chloride precursor with strong Lewis acidity have high selectivities toward α,β-unsaturated alcohol. In this work, the addition of Ir in the Ru/ZnO catalysts also affects the surface acidity of the catalysts, as the NH3-TPD results (Fig. 4) demonstrate that the strength of surface acidity declines with increasing Ir content in the catalyst. The highest selectivity (90%) was obtained on the Ru–0.125Ir/ZnO catalyst, which has the strongest strength of the surface acidity. This is in good agreement with the previous reports that strong surface acidity helps to promote the selectivity to crtoyl alcohol because the acidic sites could chemisorb the carbonyl oxygen in the crotonaldehyde molecule [5]. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2, the deactivation of the catalyst still occurs, especially after 5h. The reason for deactivation phenomena has been extensively discussed in the literature [33,34]. It has been recognized that the deactivation is a result of the formation of surface deposits, which block the surface active sites of the catalysts [35]. Another explanation for the catalyst deactivation relates to the carbon monoxide molecules generated by the decarbonylation of the reactant molecules (CH3CHCHCHO→CH3CHCH2 +CO) [36], which strongly adsorbs on metal surface and poisons the catalysts during the reaction [33]. Similar deactivation has been observed over Ir based catalysts and the deactivation was attributed to the CO strongly adsorbed on surface Ir atoms [15]. In order to further explore the effect of CO adsorption on the Ru–xIr/ZnO catalyst, in situ CO poisoning experiment was performed. CO poisoning experiment was carried out as follows: after the reduction of Ru–xIr/ZnO catalyst with H2, 1.0ml CO was pulsed into the reactor. It was found that the initial activity decreases drastically after CO injection, namely, the initial conversion of crotonaldehyde declined from 98.5 to 74.5% for the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalyst, and 96.5 to 56.3% for the Ru/ZnO catalyst. This is also supported by the fact that C3 compounds such as propylene and propane are detected in the products (Fig. 5). Thus, it could be concluded that CO molecules adsorbed on the surface of Ru–Ir atoms are probably responsible for the catalyst deactivation. Fig. 7 compares the CO-TPD profiles of the Ru/ZnO and Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalysts. It clearly shows that CO desorption occurs at the temperature range of 80–320°C on both catalysts. Moreover, the desoprtion amount of CO on the Ru/ZnO is much more than that on the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO, which could well explain the more severe deactivation on the Ru/ZnO than on the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO. In order to further explain the reason for the deactivation of the catalysts, the used Ru/ZnO and Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalysts were measured by TPO technique and Raman spectroscopy. From the TPO profiles of the used catalyst as shown in Fig. 8 , CO2 desorption peak and H2O desorption peak are observed. A shoulder peak with maximum value at 160°C, which can be attributed to the moisture absorbed on catalyst from the air. When the temperature is up to 200°C, the MS signal of CO2 appears and increases, as well as the H2O signal. The presence of both of the signals is probably due to the oxidation of organic compounds which cover on the surface of catalysts. A comparison of the TPO profiles of the used Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO and Ru/ZnO reveals that the amounts of desorbed CO2 and H2O are much larger on the Ru/ZnO than on the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO, indicating more organic species on the Ru/ZnO, which could be another reason for the rapid deactivation of the Ru/ZnO catalyst. As for the Raman spectra, a peak at ca. 1600cm−1 which could be attributed to the carbon deposit on catalyst was observed on both used Ru/ZnO and Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalysts [37], while there is no such peak for the fresh catalysts. The more intensive peak on the Ru/ZnO catalyst than that on Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalyst further indicates that more carbon deposit formed during the reaction on the former catalyst. The carbon deposit is generally related to the surface acidity, as strong Lewis acid sites on the catalyst are usually prone to forming carbon deposit and leading to deactivation of catalyst for the reaction [38]. Since the NH3-TPD results (Fig. 4) show that the addition of Ir decrease the strength of the Lewis acid sites, thus it could be concluded that the addition of Ir element changes the properties of surface acidity of the catalyst and the carbon deposit on the catalyst could be significantly suppressed. That is another reason that the Ru–0.5Ir/ZnO catalyst has superior performance to the Ru/ZnO catalyst."
10,Conclusions,"This work demonstrates catalytic performance of the Ru catalysts could be effectively improved by proper modification. The addition of Ir in the Ru/ZnO could significantly promote the stability of the catalyst for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, although deactivation still exists during the reaction. The enhancement could be attributed to the formation of RuIr alloy in the catalyst by which the electronic properties of Ru and Ir species could be properly adjusted, and weakened surface acidity compared to the Ru/ZnO catalyst. Concerning the catalyst deactivation, it was due to the strong chemisorption of CO on the metal surface and the deposition of organic compounds on the catalysts surface."
