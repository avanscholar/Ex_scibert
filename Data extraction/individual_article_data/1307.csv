0,Introduction,"TiO2 is a well-known semiconductor photocatalyst and has been extensively used for environmental remediation [1], clean energy [2,3], luminescence [4], magnetic [5], and gas sensor [6,7] applications. The photocatalytic performance of TiO2 depends on several factors that include particle (or crystallite) size, crystallinity, surface area, and porosity. TiO2 is often microporous in nature; therefore, facile diffusion of the bulky reactant molecules and accessibility of the active sites to them are limited and hence extensive efforts are directed toward the preparation of highly porous titania based nanomaterials. There are many methods for synthesizing porous TiO2 nanomaterials [8–13]. Among them, sol–gel synthesis is of particular interest; since, this method shows potential for scale-up and is fairly economical [8]. The obtained materials from sol–gel synthesis show high homogeneity with physico-chemical properties comparable to that of TiO2 formed from other methods [9,11,12]. Sol-gel reactions can be described by two important reactions: hydrolysis and condensation reactions of the sol to form a gel. The resulting wet gel (that still contains solvents) dried by a variety of methods and the porosity of the final dry nanomaterial (powder or monolith) is determined by the drying step, which is a key step in the processing of these materials. Drying of the gel (to remove the solvents) at room temperature leads to the formation of more dense and less porous materials (xerogels). This results from the collapse of the porous network due to interfacial tension associated with the formation of a liquid–vapor interface. One effective way to overcome the collapse of the pores is to eliminate the liquid–vapor interface. This can be done by removing the solvent in a supercritical state so as to minimize the formation of a liquid–vapor interface and thus preserve the high porosity inherently present in the wet gel. Materials dried by supercritical drying (SCD) method are called aerogels and these show low agglomeration, low thermal conductivity, low density, and relatively high surface area, compared to xerogels that are formed by removal of solvents under ambient conditions. Aerogels have been applied in Cherenkov reactors [14], luminescence [15], battery [16], and space [17], applications respectively. There are two methods for supercritical drying (SCD); low temperature supercritical drying (LTSCD) and high temperature supercritical drying (HTSCD). LTSCD involves exchange of solvent with supercritical CO2 [18–22] at low temperatures. This process can be quite laborious and time-sensitive since the exchange of solvent needs to be conducted multiple times and for long durations. Thus, the processing time from the wet gel to the dry form (monolith or powders) can range from several days to as long as a few weeks. Another disadvantage of LTSCD is the formation of materials with low crystallinity even after calcination at 500 °C. The use of aerogel derived materials for hydrogen generation from photocatalytic splitting of water is limited. Recently Lin et al. [18] and Daniela et al. [19] reported the photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water using LTSCD derived TiO2 aerogels under UV irradiation. They observed superior performance of TiO2 aerogel compared to conventional method (hydrothermal) derived TiO2 nanostructures. However, the crystallinity of such aerogel was found to be fairly modest even after calcination at 500 °C [23–27]. In HTSCD, the solvent (usually alcohol) present in the wet gel is directly removed under supercritical conditions and this process takes much shorter time (a few hours) and thus it is attractive to explore the use of HTSCD method for the preparation of titania nanomaterials. In addition, the HTSCD method affords the possibility of obtaining materials with higher crystallinities. It is well-known that crystallinity has significant contribution in photocatalytic reactions [28]. Also, it has been reported that crystallinity of materials can be altered through use of appropriate polar solvents [29,30]. Moreover, the materials obtained by the HTSCD can be used as catalysts directly after drying without an additional thermal treatment. In addition, the sol–gel method in combination with supercritical drying is a most promising template-free method to prepare materials with a mesoporous structure. Thus, in this study we explore the synthesis of TiO2 aerogels via HTSCD method. In addition, we also report the variation in the physico-chemical properties of the titania aerogels prepared using various polar solvents. Moreover, there is no report in the literature regarding the application of HTSCD derived TiO2 aerogels for solar hydrogen production and this provides the motivation for the present work. Besides the lack of this knowledge, most of the HTSCD derived TiO2 aerogels have been formed through repeated washing of the gel with solvents prior to HTSCD [23–27] leading to extra processing steps and long times. Thus, the reported TiO2 aerogel materials suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) low temperature supercritical drying which often results in low crystallinity of the final materials even after calcination, (ii) synthesis steps that include multi-stage solvent exchange (or washing of the gel) which is cumbersome and time-consuming, (iii) lack of a systematic study of the role of solvents in processing aerogel derived materials and its detailed physico-chemical effects in obtaining structure-activity relationship, (iv) lack of knowledge of the activity of TiO2 aerogel prepared by HTSCD method for photocatalytic splitting of water, and (v) use of expensive co-catalyst such as Pt. Therefore, in this work, we focus on the synthesis of titania aerogel synthesis through HTSCD method using different alcohols as solvents. The influence of alcohols in structural, morphological, and textural properties are discussed in detail. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of HTSCD derived aerogels were compared with room temperature derived TiO2-xerogel. Thus, the synthesis of TiO2 aerogels having high crystallinity and improved textural properties will provide an opportunity to apply such materials for decontamination, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and clean energy applications."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Methanol (99.8%, Acros chemicals, USA), Propanol (>99%, Fisher chemicals, U.S.A), Ethanol (99.9%, AAPER alcohol, U.S.A), Nitric acid (Fisher chemicals, U.S.A), and Titanium isopropoxide (98%, Acros chemicals, USA), were used as received. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments."
3,Effect of aging on the formation of TiO2 aerogels,"2.2 Effect of aging on the formation of TiO2 aerogels The reaction mixtures were aged at various reaction times at room temperature during synthesis to clarify the effect of aging. Typically, in a 250 mL conical flask, 100 mL of methanol was added. 2.4 mL of titanium isopropoxide was added drop wise to methanol under vigorous stirring. The solution mixture was stirred for 10 min to ensure homogeneity. To this reaction mixture, 0.6 mL of deionized water was added drop-wise to initiate the hydrolysis reaction. The resulting gels were stirred at 300 rpm and aged for 2, 4, 6, and 12 h at room temperature with continuous stirring. After the aging process was completed, the contents were poured into a glass liner (600 mL capacity) and placed in an autoclave (Parr Model 5500 high pressure compact stirred reactor with temperature controller 4836) and N2 gas was introduced into the autoclaves at a pressure of ∼0.70 MPa. The autoclave was heated at a rate of 1 °C/min to a final temperature of 265 °C. Once the final temperature is achieved, the pressure of the autoclave was found to be in the range of 6.0–11 MPa depending on the nature of the solvent employed. The autoclave was then maintained at 265 °C for 15 min. The critical temperatures of methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol are the 240, 243, and 235 °C and thus a final temperature of 265 °C, slightly higher than the critical temperature was chosen in this study. The solvents were removed quickly from the wet gel by opening a venting outlet valve provided in the autoclave. The autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature. The autoclave was then dis-assembled and the powders obtained were dried in a static air oven overnight at 80 °C and then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h at a heating rate of 3 °C/min. in static air environment. The final products obtained were labeled as TiO2-M-2h, TiO2-M-4h, TiO2-M-6h, and TiO2-M-12h for 2, 4, 6, and 12 h of aged gel times, respectively."
4,Alcohol assisted synthesis of TiO2 aerogels,"2.3 Alcohol assisted synthesis of TiO2 aerogels To study the effect of alcohols in the formation of aerogels, the reaction mixtures were aged for 6 h in various alcohols at room temperature prior to HTSCD. Typically in a 250 mL conical flask, 100 mL of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol) were added separately. To this solution, 2.4 mL of titanium isopropoxide was added drop wise under vigorous stirring. The solution mixture was stirred for 10 min to ensure the homogeneity. To this reaction mixture, 0.6 mL of deionized water was added drop wise and slowly to the reaction mixture and the resulting gels were stirred for 6 h at room temperature. The gels were processed as described in Section 2.2 previously. The product obtained after calcination were labeled as TiO2-M-6h, TiO2-E-6h, and TiO2-2P-6h for methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol solvent derived aerogels, respectively."
5,Synthesis of TiO2-xerogel,"2.4 Synthesis of TiO2-xerogel To compare the effect of HTSCD for the formation of TiO2 aerogel, we synthesized a TiO2 material having comparable surface area as that of an aerogel material at room temperature by the sol–gel method. Typically, 2.2 mL of titanium isopropoxide was added drop wise to a solution containing 18 mL of ethanol under vigorous stirring in a beaker. The hydrolysis process was initiated by the addition of 1 mL of H2O and catalyzed by the addition of 100 μL of concentrated HNO3. The mixture was stirred for 3 h to obtain a wet gel. The resulting gel was kept for drying at room temperature. After room temperature drying, the obtained powders were dried in a static air oven for overnight at 80 °C and calcined at 500 °C for 6 h at a heating rate of 3 °C/min. in static air environment. Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation steps involved in the synthesis of titania aerogels and xerogels."
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.5 Catalyst characterization The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, N2 physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The powder XRD measurements were conducted at room temperature using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540806 Å). The instrument was operated at 40 kV, 44 mA, and scanned with a step size of 0.02° at a count time of 1°/min in the range of 2θ = 10–80°. The crystallite sizes of the materials were calculated by selecting anatase peaks at 2θ = 25°, 48°, and 62°, respectively. Raman spectra were recorded by a Horiba Jobin Yvon-Aramis Raman spectrometer with a He–Ne laser (532 nm) as the light source. FT-IR analysis was carried out using Bruker ALPHA instrument. The spectra were acquired in the range 4000 cm−1 to 500 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The textural properties of TiO2 aerogels were measured by N2 physisorption. For N2 physisorption measurements, the samples were dried overnight at 80 °C and degassed at 100 °C extensively prior to start of the experiments. N2 isotherms were obtained at −196 °C using a NOVA 2200e (Quantachrome Instruments) surface area and pore size analyzer. The surface area was calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation within a relative pressure range (P/P 0) of 0.05–0.30. The pore volume was determined from the amount of N2 adsorbed at the highest relative pressure of (P/P 0) ≈ 0.99. The pore diameter and pore size distribution plots were obtained by applying the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) equation to the desorption isotherm. SEM images were recorded using Zeiss Supra (40 VP FESEM) instrument. The powders were gently smeared on the double-coated tape fixed on top of the aluminum sample holder. The TEM images were acquired using a Hitachi (H7000 FA) instrument operating at 100 kV. Prior to TEM analysis, the aerogel sample TiO2-M-6h was dispersed in ethanol followed by sonicating the mixture for 1 h. One drop of the dilute suspension was placed on a TEM grid and allowed to dry overnight. The DRS were recorded on a Cary 100 Bio UV–Visible spectrophotometer with a praying mantis diffuse reflection accessory (Harrick Scientific). The particle size of TiO2 was calculated using the formula [31]: (1) Δ E g = ( ℏ 2 π 2 / 2 R 2 μ ) − 1.8 e 2 / ɛ R where ΔE g is the difference in band gap between bulk TiO2 (3.2 eV for anatase) and TiO2 synthesized in this study (the band gap was derived from Kubelka–Munk (K–M) plot by extrapolating the steep portion of the absorbance to the x-axis), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, R is the radius of the particle size determined from the above formula, μ is the reduced mass of the excitons. The value of 1 / μ = 1 / m e ∗ + 1 / m h ∗ was used, where m e ∗ and m h ∗ are the effective mass of electron and holes in TiO2, respectively. The value of m e ∗ = 9 m e and m h ∗ = 2 m e respectively and m e is the mass of electron in TiO2. The constant ɛ represents the dielectric constant of TiO2."
7,Photocatalytic water splitting,"2.6 Photocatalytic water splitting Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions were carried out in a quartz reactor as described previously by our group [32–35]. Typically, a known amount of the photocatalyst (1 g/L) was suspended in a solution of H2O and methanol (molar ratio of [H2O]/[CH3OH] = 8). The suspension was degassed for 30 min with high-purity Argon prior to irradiation. The sample was continuously stirred throughout the course of the experiment. A 300 W Xenon lamp (Oriel light source) equipped with a light filter of wavelength ranges from 240 to 400 nm was used as UV light source. The amount of H2 produced was measured by gas chromatography (SRI 8610 C) equipped with a molecular sieve column and a TCD detector and using a previously calibrated plot. The reproducibility test was conducted by repeating the photocatalytic test with the highest active catalyst."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Powder XRD,"3.1 Powder XRD Powder XRD patterns of the TiO2 aerogels prepared using methanol solvent are shown in Fig. 1 . All the aerogel samples consist of anatase phase and the d values obtained are consistent with previous reports [19]. The aging time can influence the physico-chemical properties of TiO2. To study this factor, different TiO2 catalysts were prepared by changing the aging time from 2 to 12 h followed by HTSCD and calcination as discussed in the experimental section. Fig. 1A shows the XRD pattern of TiO2 aerogels prepared by aging the gels in methanol for 2, 4, 6, and 12 h followed by HTSCD and calcination. The crystallite sizes calculated for these materials are shown in Table 1 . Campbell et al. [36] and Calleja et al. [37] reported that the high polarity of methanol accelerates sol–gel reactions and results in the quick formation of gel compared to other alcohols such as ethanol, 1-propanol etc. and thus our preliminary studies were carried out using methanol as the solvent. The TiO2 aerogel derived after 2 h of aging shows crystallite size of 23 ± 1 nm. TiO2 aerogel formed through HTSCD and calcination of 4, 6, and 12 h of aging show slightly lower but very comparable crystallite sizes of nearly 20 ± 1 nm. On increasing the aging time, precipitates with a high polymeric structure may be obtained. However, during the process of aging, not only poly-condensation reactions, but dissolution and re-precipitation of the gel also occur suggesting that the final size is a balance of these factors [38–40]. The results from this study indicates that the crystallite size of titania lies in a narrow range of 19–23 nm indicating that the HTSCD and calcination steps also modulate the crystallite size of the final material. We observed that the TiO2 aerogel formed from 6 h of aging in methanol showed higher surface area and larger pore volume suggesting that 6 h seem to be the optimal aging time under our experimental conditions and hence this aging time was used for subsequent experiments. Fig. 1B shows the XRD patterns of HTSCD derived TiO2 aerogels formed from the gels after 6 h of aging in methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, respectively. Behnajady et al. [29] reported that the crystallinity and phase of TiO2 could be altered by varying the nature of alcohol employed in the sol–gel process. It was reported that sol–gel reaction in the presence of highly polar medium was rapid and the formation of oligomeric titanium alkoxide species would be largely suppressed [39,40]. Rapid formation of titanium hydroxide and their condensation to form TiO2 nanoparticles was favored in the presence of highly polar medium [39,40]. It has been previously reported that the crystallite sizes of ZnO prepared hydrothermally and then calcined at 400 °C could be tuned by changing the nature of the alcohol [41]. Thus, we were interested in exploring if such effects manifest after the sample is subjected to HTSCD followed by calcination. The physical properties of the solvent such as viscosity and in particular the dielectric constant of the medium could play an important role in determining the final size of the particles. The dielectric constant of the solvent affects the rates of hydrolysis and condensation reactions, which in turn influences the nucleation and growth of the particles. In general, the use of solvents with low dielectric constant should lead to small nucleation time and larger particle growth [41] since conditions of super-saturation exist when low dielectric constants are used [30]. However, we notice that the crystallite size of the titania particles after HTSCD and calcination at 500 °C vary in a narrow range of 13–23 nm suggesting that the HTSCD and calcination can make this variation negligible in the final product [38] in contrast to hydrothermal conditions as reported previously [41]. TiO2-M-6h, TiO2-E-6h, and TiO2-2P-6h show crystallite sizes of 20, 13, and 18 nm, respectively. He et al. reported that HTSCD resists the phase transformation of anatase crystal phase consistent with our observations in this study [42]. Our results from aging and use of different alcohols indicate that solvent properties such as polarity, dielectric of alcohols, and the steric hindrance associated with the alkyl chain of alcohols [43], are not prominent after HTSCD and calcination, leading to formation of titania nanoparticles with crystallite sizes in the range 13–23 nm. The XRD pattern of the TiO2-xerogel prepared in ethanol followed by calcination is also shown in Fig. 1B for comparison and the crystallite size of 16 nm was estimated for this material."
10,Raman spectra,"3.2 Raman spectra Fig. 2 A shows the Raman spectra of aerogel synthesized at various aging times in methanol and subsequently dried under HTSCD process and calcined at 550 °C. High intense peaks are observed for the sample aged for 6 h indicating the high crystallinity of this material since the Raman spectra is very sensitive to the degree of crystallinity. It seems that Raman spectroscopic studies are more sensitive than powder XRD studies regarding the nature of crystallinity of the materials. For reasons unknown at this moment and beyond the scope of this work, the crystallinity of the material aged for 4 h seem to be the least among the four samples. We propose that 6 h of aging is suitable for the synthesis of high quality TiO2 aerogel in methanol by HTSCD process. Fig. 2B shows the Raman spectra of TiO2 aerogels synthesized from 6 h of aged TiO2 gel in methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol under HTSCD followed by calcination. The spectra of TiO2-M-6h shows bands at 141, 191 393, 513, and 633 cm−1, which are associated with anatase phase of TiO2 [44]. The Raman bands, from TiO2-E-6h and TiO2-2P-6h aerogels are also shown. However, not all of the peaks associated with anatase are prominent in these two materials and they only show a peak at 140 cm−1. The Raman spectrum of TiO2-xerogel is also shown in Fig. 2B for comparison. The Raman spectral intensity of TiO2-xerogel is lower than that of TiO2-M-6h."
11,FT-IR spectra,3.3 FT-IR spectra The FT-IR spectra of TiO2 aerogels prepared at various aging times in methanol (Fig. S1A) and the TiO2 aerogels and TiO2-xerogel prepared in various alcohols (Fig. S1B) are also recorded. The spectra show a peak near 450 cm−1 due to Ti–O–Ti bonds and indicate absence of surface alkoxy groups indicating that calcination of the aerogels at 500 °C was sufficient.
12,N2-sorption analysis,"3.4 N2-sorption analysis The aerogel synthesized after 2 and 4 h of aging in methanol show almost identical surface area, pore volume, and the values are ∼38 m2/g and ∼0.10 cm3/g, respectively. These results indicate that 2 or 4 h of aging do not show any noticeable change in the textural properties of the aerogel formed. However, after 6 h of aging, the surface area of the resulting aerogel increases to ∼82 m2/g. Also, the pore volume increases from 0.10 cm3/g to 0.25 cm3/g. However after 12 h of aging, the surface area and pore volume of the aerogel reduces to ∼47 m2/g and ∼0.18 cm3/g, respectively. This suggests that when the aging process is carried for longer durations of time, i.e. 12 h, the inter-particle zone, called necks are weaker compared to sample aged for 6 h. Precipitates with weaker necks undergo shrinkage during the drying step, sinter during calcination and this leads to collapse of the pores leading to lower surface areas and pore volumes. All of the aerogel materials prepared in these study show similar adsorption isotherms (with some variations in the hysteresis type) and two representative isotherms are shown in Fig. 3 . For comparison purposes, we selected the representative material TiO2-M-2h and TiO2-xerogel to illustrate the importance of the HTSCD step. Fig. 3A and B shows the N2-sorption isotherms of TiO2-M-2h and TiO2-xerogel, respectively. The corresponding pore size distribution plots are also shown in the inset plots. Fig. 3A indicates the isotherm of the material is of Type IV (that is typical of mesoporous materials) and the hysteresis loop is H3 type according to IUPAC classification [45,46]. The isotherms show monolayer adsorption at low values of relative pressures (P/P 0), followed by multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation. The presence of isotherms with type H3 loops that do not level off at saturation values of relative pressures are reported for materials that are composed of loose assemblies of aggregates that form slit-like pores. The specific surface area obtained for TiO2-M-2h aerogel is ∼38 m2/g. The pore size distribution plots shown in the inset of Fig. 3A indicate that TiO2-M-2h aerogel has a bimodal distribution of pores centered near 25 and 90 Å. The textural properties of the aerogels are shown in Tables 1 and 2 . The nitrogen isotherm of TiO2-xerogel material is shown in Fig. 3B. TiO2-xerogel initially exhibits isotherm typical of mesoporous materials and show low surface area and pore volume compared to the aerogels synthesized in this study. TiO2-xerogel shows H2 type hysteresis loop that is triangle in shape and having a steep desorption branch. The BJH pore size distribution has a narrow mesoporosity ranging between 20 and 60 Å with pores centered near 40 Å, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3B. In comparing Fig. 3A and B, one can notice that the HTSCD step leads to materials with larger pore sizes indicating that the removal of the solvent under supercritical conditions minimizes pore collapse and preserves the pores present in the wet gel. The N2-sorption isotherms and pore size distribution plots obtained for the TiO2 aerogels prepared by varying the aging time are shown in Figs. S2A and S2B. The samples aged for 4 and 12 h show similar isotherms (type IV with H3 type hysteresis loops). Interestingly, the sample aged for 6 h show isotherms that do not close at low relative pressure values. Adsorption isotherms for such materials arise due to a combination of factors that include swelling of adsorbent during adsorption and some amount of chemisorption in addition to physisorption [45]. The pore size distribution plot shown in Fig. S2B indicates a fairly broad pores centered near 100 Å. The isotherms and pore size distribution plots of samples synthesized in different solvents are shown in Figs. S3A and S3B, respectively. The isotherms are of type IV with hysteresis loops of type H3 with the exception of TiO2-M-6h (type H2 with isotherm that does not close at low relative pressures). From Tables 1 and 2, it is clear that the aerogel TiO2-M-6h has larger surface area. The TiO2 aerogel prepared at 6 h of aging in methanol has highest surface area (82 m2/g) while The TiO2 aerogels derived from ethanol and isopropanol show surface areas of 75 and 38 m2/g, respectively. The aerogel TiO2-E-6h has comparable textural properties (surface area and pore volume) as that of TiO2-M-6h. Schneider et al. reported that under HTSCD condition TiO2 derived from isopropanol has lower surface area compared to methanol, and our results are consistent with their observations [28]. Our surface area results suggest that the dielectric constant of the solvent employed has some influence on the resulting surface area of the material in accordance with our previous observations for Mg(OH)2 system [47]. The dielectric constants of methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol are 33, 25, and 20 at room temperature and our previous results [41,47] indicate that the surface areas of the final oxide material decrease as the dielectric constant of the solvent decrease and the trends in this study confirm this. From the BJH pore size distribution, the pore size distribution seems to be broader for ethanol and isopropanol derived TiO2 aerogel compared to the sample prepared using methanol as the solvent."
13,Electron microscopy,"3.5 Electron microscopy The materials were analyzed by SEM and TEM analysis to obtain information about morphology of the TiO2 aerogels. The SEM image of a representative aerogel, TiO2-M-6h is shown in Fig. 4 A. The SEM image indicates that the aerogel consist of secondary particles (larger aggregates of smaller titania particles), some of which are spherical in shape. The TEM image of TiO2-M-6h is also shown in Fig. 4B. The image consists of both spherical and irregular shaped nanoparticles and the size of the particle ranges from 20 to 40 nm."
14,UV–Visible DRS,"3.6 UV–Visible DRS The UV–Visible DRS of TiO2 aerogels are shown in Fig. 5 . The TiO2 aerogels prepared at various aging time followed by HTSCD in methanol is shown in Fig. 5A. The spectra show negligible variation in absorbance with small shifts in the onset of absorption. The band gap energies calculated from Kubelka–Munk (K–M) plot (Fig. 5B) is shown in Table 1, which indicates that the band gap of these materials is not altered by changing the aging times. The particle size estimated for TiO2-M-6h and TiO2-M-2h based on equation (1) indicate that TiO2-M-6h and TiO2-M-2h are 6.8 nm and 9.6 nm, respectively. Please note, that in equation (1), the band gap of bulk titania used is 3.2 eV and hence equation (1) can be used only if the band gap of the materials recorded are greater than 3.2 eV and hence we do not report values of particle sizes of titania for TiO2-M-4h and TiO2-M-12h. Fig. 5C shows the DRS spectra of the TiO2 aerogels synthesized in the presence of various alcohols. The corresponding K–M plot is shown in Fig. 5D. The absorption and K–M plot for TiO2-xerogel is also shown for comparison. The spectra indicate that the onset of absorption varies negligibly with TiO2 aerogels formed in various alcohols. The band gap energy calculated from K–M plot for these materials is also shown in Table 2. The aerogels prepared in ethanol medium shows a steep rise in absorbance in the UV region (200–350 nm) than other aerogels. This variation may be attributed to the surface defects associated with aerogels since Raman spectra of this sample indicates low crystallinity. Compared to TiO2-xerogel, the absorption wavelength is slightly blue shifted for all aerogel materials."
15,Photocatalytic water splitting,"3.7 Photocatalytic water splitting We have conducted the photocatalytic H2 evolution in aqueous suspension with methanol as sacrificial agent (electron donor) for selected aerogels under UV light illumination. Even though the surface area of aerogels derived from ethanol and isopropanol is moderately high, the BJH pore size distribution shows high macro-porosity in these samples. It was reported that high macro-porosity reduces the photocatalytic efficiency [43]. In addition, the textural properties of TiO2-M-2h and TiO2-xerogel are similar and hence we selected three samples (TiO2-M-2h, TiO2-M-6h, and TiO2-xerogel) for evaluating the photocatalytic activity. Further, Raman studies indicate that the crystallinities of these three samples are quite comparable and hence a comparison of these three samples will provide information regarding the role of HTSCD and other physico-chemical properties and their influence in photocatalytic reactions in this study. The photocatalytic activities of these three samples are shown in Fig. 6 . The TiO2-xerogel gave the least amount of H2, and the value obtained after 4 h of irradiation is 80 μmol/g. The aerogel samples, TiO2-M-2h and TiO2-M-6h give H2 evolution of 217 μmol/g and 390 μmol/g respectively under the same conditions. It is clear that the pore diameters of these two samples are similar, and hence we propose that higher surface area (82 m2/g), and small particle size (6.8 nm) of TiO2-M-6h are important factors that lead to its relatively high hydrogen production compared TiO2-M-2h material that has surface area of 38 m2/g and higher particle size of 9.6 nm. In addition, the slightly higher crystallinity of TiO2-M-6h in comparison to TiO2-M-2h may also be a factor in its higher activity. The material, TiO2-M-2h produces more hydrogen compared to TiO2-xerogel although the surface areas and the crystallinities are quite comparable. This suggests that the pore diameter may also be an important factor contributing to the enhanced activity of the aerogel samples. Therefore, the larger pore diameter of the aerogels samples also contributes to the enhanced activity of catalyst since it is reported that enhanced diffusion of water molecules is facilitated in large pore sized materials leading to higher activity for hydrogen production [48]. It has been reported that particle size is an factor in photocatalytic reactions [49]. As the particle size decreases, the photogenerated electrons and holes have to cross a smaller path length to reach the surface and participate in interfacial reactions. Therefore, the volume recombination of photogenerated charge-carriers is minimized in small size particles [49,50]. Moreover, small particle sizes have strong influence on light absorption and less light scattering efficiencies [50]. The calculated particle size for TiO2-M-6h (6.8 nm) is lower than TiO2-M-2h (9.6 nm). Therefore, we believe that volume recombination is lower in TiO2-M-6h than TiO2-M-2h and hence TiO2-M-6h shows higher activity. However for the TiO2-xerogel material, even though the surface area is comparable to that of TiO2-M-2h, it shows lower catalytic efficiency. From DRS, we observed that the band gap of TiO2-xerogel is 3.10 eV; this is smaller than bulk anatase TiO2 and thus we are unable to use the Brus equation (1) to estimate the particle size; however, the particle size is expected to be greater than in TiO2-M-2h (9.6 nm). Thus, due to enhanced volume recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers, the activity of TiO2-xerogel will be reduced. Therefore the volume recombination and particle size are decisive factors for explaining the differences in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in TiO2-M-2h and TiO2-xerogels. In order to evaluate the reproducibility of the photocatalytic experiments, results from two different runs from TiO2-M-6h is shown in Fig. S4 and once can notice the high reproducibility."
16,Conclusions,"Highly crystalline TiO2 aerogels with high surface area, large pore diameters, and lower particle sizes, are prepared successfully by sol–gel method followed by high temperature supercritical drying in various alcohols and controlled aging of the initial gels. The obtained aerogel materials showed photocatalytic H2 evolution by water splitting in the absence of Pt as a co-catalyst, and the efficiency of the materials depends on crystallinity, surface area, pore diameter, and particle size. The improved photocatalytic H2 generation from the TiO2 aerogel materials compared to TiO2-xerogel indicates that aerogel TiO2 materials are better candidate for photocatalysis and also for developing solar energy conversion devices."
