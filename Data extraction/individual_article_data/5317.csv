0,Introduction,"Among various types of renewable energies, mechanical energy is one of the abundant energy resources observed in our daily-living environments such as human body motions [1], wind flow [2], water flow [2], and mechanical vibrations [3]. Converting such type of mechanical energies into electricity is an attractive approach, and nanogenerators have been successfully employed so far to harvest these energies [1–3]. In particular, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted tremendous interest due to their broad range of applications including its self-power ability to drive electrical sensors and portable electronic systems [4,5]. Moreover, TENGs with several advantageous features including their high flexibility, light weight, eco-friendliness, low manufacturing cost, strong robustness behavior, etc. can be easily adopted into the wearables to efficiently harvest the daily human activities as well as to power various portable electronics [6–9]. Unfortunately, the electrical output performance of the TENGs is very low and not significantly enough for portable electronic applications [10,11]. Thus, various approaches have been developed to improve the performances of TENGs, including the choice of optimal opposite triboelectric materials and their surface modification [12]. Developing a new type of triboelectric materials and modifying its surface involves high complexicity and also needs expensive fabrication equipments, which can obiously increase the fabrication cost of TENGs and restricts them for commercial applications [13,14]. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has gained much interest as the piezoelectric polymer as well as the triboelectric polymer in the nanogenerators owing to its advantageous features like high flexibility, easy synthesis process, long lastingness, and easiness to modify its surface charge density by simply embedding the ferroelectric particles into it [15]. Usually, PVDF shows five dissimilar phases such as α, β, γ, δ, and ε under various fabrications considerations [16–18]. From all these phases, the β phase is electroactive which possesses the high electric dipole moment. So, the β phase attained much attention in PVDF films for mechanical energy conversion, sensor, and actuator applications [19–21]. The α phase is electrically inactive, and it has TGTG′ confirmation and no electric dipole moment because of –CH2−/−CF2- electric dipole arrangement anti-parallel to the polar axis [22,23]. Thus, α phase cannot be beneficial for practical energy harvesting applications. In contrast, the β phase is electrically active with a TTTT conformation and it can exhibit a large electric dipole moment due to the –CH2−/−CF2- electric dipole arrangement parallel to the polar axis, i.e., called as a piezoelectric property, which can be utilized in energy harvesting applications [24–26]. The γ phase is electrically active with TTTGTTTG’ conformation but has less piezoelectric property than the β phase. But it has a higher piezoelectric property than the α phase. Therefore, the β and γ phases are beneficial for better piezoelectric properties [27–29]. Besides, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has attracted potential interest in the academic and industrial fields due to its advantageous characteristics such as semi-crystalline property, good film-forming nature, better physical, chemical, and mechanical strengths, high solubility in water, high dielectric strength, environmentally friendly feature, biocompatibility, and biodegradability [30–33]. Particularly, the PVA polymer possesses a large number of hydroxyl groups, and its synthesis process is facile, time-saving, and easy to scale up [34,35]. The PVA polymer owns better stability at elevated temperatures, shape recovery by elasticity, high tensile strength, and good mechanical properties [36]. Both the PVDF and microstructure aligned PVA (MS@PVA) polymers can be developed with low cost and high efficiency, and they are scalable approaches with high demand to enhance the output performance of the nanogenerators for real-time/practical applications. It is noticeable that the selection of such positive and negative triboelectric materials plays important role in enhancing the output performance of the nanogenerators. Herein, we have reported a facile, cost-effective, and high-performance TENG based on the PVDF and MS@PVA polymers as tribo negative and tribo positive materials. The prepared polymer films are highly flexible and easy to fabricate for large scale. To further enhance the output performance of TENG, the surface area of triboelectric material was modified by introducing the microstructures on the surface of the PVA polymer. Moreover, the microstructures on the surface of PVA polymer were developed by the facile and cost-effective soft imprinting lithography technique via a commercially available inexpensive sandpaper mold instead of the expensive coupled plasma reactive ion etching and other solution-based etching techniques [37,38]. As a result, the surface-to-volume ratio between the active materials of TENG can be significantly enhanced, resulting in the improved effective surface contact area as well as the accumulated surface charge density. Ultimately, the practical applicability of the TENG device was demonstrated by using its electrical output to power various low-power electronic systems. This study not only paves a new path to enhance the electrical output performance of the nanogenerators through surface modification but also offers a sustainable and clean energy solution for portable electronic devices."
1,Experimental procedure,"Fabrication of triboelectric materials and TENG device: The PVDF and MS@PVA film fabrication process is shown schematically in Fig. 1 . In order to develop a PVDF film, firstly 2 g of α-phase PVDF powder was dissolved into a mixture consisting of 15 ml of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF; Aldrich) and 5 ml of acetone solution, using a probe sonicator at an amplitude of 40% for 60 min. Afterward, the homogeneously dissolved PVDF solution was poured into a 90 mm glass Petri dish, followed by the curing treatment at 75 °C for 45 min. The resultant PVDF film was cut into a 2 × 2 cm2 area and utilized as a negative triboelectric material for designing the TENG. In addition, the PVA polymers with and without the microstructures on their surface were prepared by the following process. Firstly, 2 g of PVA was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water and the resultant solution was placed on the hot plate at 100 °C under the continuous stirring until it became a clear and transparent solution. Such a transparent PVA solution was further poured either onto the flat substrate or sandpaper mold, followed by the curing treatment at 60 °C for 2 h. After drying the PVA films with and without the microstructures, they were peeled off from the corresponding molds and were further diced into a 2 × 2 cm2 area for use as a positive triboelectric material of the TENG. Both the resultant triboelectric materials such as the PVDF and PVA films were glued onto the aluminum (Al) tapes with the same dimensions of 2 × 2 cm2. Herein, both the Al tapes were employed as either the top or bottom electrodes of TENG. Furthermore, the PVA/Al and PVDF/Al stacks are attached at the center of two separate acrylic plates with dimensions of 5 × 5 cm2, using the polyethylene foam tape. Finally, both the acrylic substrates were assembled together by fixing four soft springs at their corners to develop a TENG device, while both the PVDF and PVA films were faced opposite to each other. Characterizations: To analyze the phase and crystallinity of PVDF and PVA films, X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD: Mac science, M18XHF-SRF) with Cu kα (1.5406 Å) radiation over a 2 θ range from 20 to 70° range were measured. The surface morphological properties of the PVDF polymer film and the MS@PVA replicated by the sandpaper were characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM: LEO SUPRA 55, Carl Zeiss). A custom-built pushing machine controlled with the N2 gas was utilized to apply a mechanical compression force on the top of TENG. A pressure indicator combined with the load cell (BONGSHIN, Inc.) was employed to detect the mechanical force applied on the top of TENG. An open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (ISC) generated by the TENG device were measured by using a digital phosphors oscilloscope (DP04104, Tektronix) with an input impedance of 40 MΩ and a low-noise current preamplifier connected to the oscilloscope, respectively."
2,Results and discussion,"The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the PVDF composite film is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The as-synthesized PVDF film via a probe sonication method induces the crystalline β phase in suitable solvents such as DMF and acetone. It is clearly observed that the α phase is noticed at 18.6° and the β phase exists at 20.18°. The β phase has all TTTT transformation and it showed excellent piezoelectric properties by attaining non-zero dipole moment through hydrogen (H) and fluorine (F) occurred at opposite sides of the backbone chain [39]. The particular chain configuration in the PVDF film produces a significant quantity of remnant polarization, which is beneficial for mechanical energy harvesting applications. The synthesis method plays a crucial role in the PVDF preparation process. Usually, in the sonication process, the generation of sound energy acts as an important function to modify the –CH2−/−CF2- dipoles by breaking the intermolecular interactions to make a homogeneous clear solution and after heat treatment, it was used to obtain a piezoelectric PVDF film. The achieving β phase is mainly due to the stress-induced and mechanical stretching effects under the sonication process. Fig. 2(b) shows the XRD pattern of PVA film, and all the diffraction peaks were well-matched with the previous literature survey [40–42]. Fig. 2(c) and (d) shows the FE-SEM images of the PVDF and MS@PVA films. These FE-SEM images are clearly revealing that the surface of PVDF film is very smooth without any nano/microstructures on it, whereas PVA film consists of microstructured patterns on its surface. The inset of Fig. 2(d) depicts the high-magnification FE-SEM image of MS@PVA film, which is clearly revealing that the microarchitectures on the sandpaper mold were successfully replicated onto the surface of the PVA film. Both the PVDF and MS@PVA films were further used as negative and positive triboelectric layers to design the TENG device and its electrical output performance was measured by applying an external mechanical pushing force on it. However, before examining the electrical output performance, the working mechanism of PVDF-MS@PVA-based TENG is schematically demonstrated in Fig. 3 (a). When the mechanical pushing force is applied to the TENG (i), the top triboelectric material (i.e., PVDF) comes into contact with the bottom one (i.e., MS@PVA). As we know, the PVDF has high triboelectric negative as compared to the PVA material, and thus the electrons are driven from the MS@PVA to PVDF layer owing to the frictional force between them, while they contact. As a result, the positive charges are generated on the surface of PVA layers and the negative ones on the PVDF layer. Next, while releasing the applied force from the TENG (ii), resilience is formed between the PVDF and MS@PVA layers, which can make two layers to be separated from each other. At this stage, the top Al electrode has lower electric potential than the bottom Al electrode, which can produce an electric potential difference and induces the electron transfer from the top Al electrode to the bottom one through an external load, until it reaches an electrostatic equilibrium. After completely releasing the force (iii), both the top and bottom parts of TENG can come back into its original positions. Then, positive and negative induced charges can be produced on the top and bottom Al electrodes, respectively. Furthermore, by once again applying an external force on the TENG (iv), both the active materials of TENG can start to move/contact each other, resulting in the redistributed charges on the top of the Al electrodes which can create a reversed electrostatic potential difference between them. This can lead to the electron flow in the opposite direction. Likewise, such cyclic electric output signals can be continuously generated by continuously applying and releasing the external forces on TENGs. For a better understanding of the TENG working mechanism of the PVDF-MS@PVA-based TENG, we performed a finite element method (FEM) simulation using Multiphysics COMSOL software between the PVDF and MS@PVA triboelectric layers. For the simulation process, the bottom PVA surface was modified with microstructures. Fig. 3(b) shows the potential distribution for TENG in different modes. When the PVDF and MS@PVA films fully contact each other, there is no potential distribution between the two layers. Whereas, while separating the two layers, the potential difference occurred between the PVDF and MS@PVA layers (approximately 200 V) was predicted in the separating (ii) state. In the fully separated state, the potential difference is almost zero, because there is no flow of charge carriers (fully separated (iii)). In again approaching state (iv), the potential distribution was estimated to be 30 V. The enhancement in the output performance of TENG is mainly due to the effective surface contact area in between the PVDF and MS@PVA layers, which enables to collect and transfer the electrostatic charges delivered from the triboelectric materials [43,44]. Furthermore, COMSOL FEM simulation for electrical potential distribution of PVDF-PVA and PVDF-MS@PVA frictional layers is shown in Fig. S2(a) and (b). The PVDF-MS@PVA frictional layers showed higher electrical potential distribution as compared to the PVDF-PVA frictional layers of TENG. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) represents the VOC and ISC values of the PVDF-PVA- and PVDF-MS@PVA-based TENG devices, under the external mechanical pushing force and frequency of 3 N and 5 Hz, respectively. Firstly, the TENG device with the PVDF and bare PVA films (i.e., PVDF-PVA) exhibited the VOC and ISC values of 170 V and 3.5 μA, respectively. Moreover, by introducing the microstructures on the surface of PVA film, the electrical output performance of the resultant PVDF-MS@PVA-based TENG was enhanced and exhibited the maximum VOC and ISC values of 230 V and 6 μA, respectively. The enhanced electrical output performance of TENG is mainly attributed to the microstructures on the surface of PVA film that can be utilized to increase its surface roughness followed by the frictional contact area at the interface of PVDF and MS@PVA films. As a result, an enhanced contact area can play a key role in improving the surface charge density across the interface of active materials as well as the electrical output performance of TENG. These results are clearly affirming the above discussion (Fig. 4(a) and (b)). For comparison, we fabricated a TENG with the PVDF as a negative triboelectric material and Al as a positive triboelectric material, and the electrical output response of the corresponding TENG is shown in Fig. S1. The PVDF-Al-based TENG exhibited the VOC and ISC values of 18 V and 1 μA, respectively. These results are clearly concluding that the pair of PVDF and MS@PVA is the best choice compared to other materials for attaining high electrical output performance of TENG. Therefore, the TENG with the optimized PVDF and MS@PVA films was employed for further analysis. Typically, dielectric constant plays an important role in enhancing the surface charge density of triboelectric material. The surface charge density of triboelectric materials is closely associated with their capacitance. The increment of the dielectric constant is able to enhance the charge trapping capability and boost the generation of a displacement current inside of tribo-pairs [45]. Fig. 4(c) shows the dielectric constant of the PVDF and MS@PVA polymers as a function of frequency. The PVDF film exhibited a dielectric constant of 12 at a frequency of 100 Hz and the MS@PVA film showed a dielectric constant of 5 at 100 Hz of frequency. From Fig. 4(c), as the frequency increased, the dielectric constant was gradually decreased due to the reduced space charge polarization effect. Furthermore, we measured the work function of the PVDF, bare PVA, and MS@PVA polymer films as shown in Fig. 4(d). The work function of polymers is a significant factor to evaluate the performance of the nanogenerators. In order to assess the effect of the microstructures on the PVA surface, the work function was measured for bare PVA and MS@PVA polymer films. The work functions of PVDF, bare PVA, and MS@PVA polymer films are noticed to be 5, 2.8, and 3.1 eV, respectively [46,47]. The enhanced work function of the MS@PVA polymer film as compared to the bare PVA polymer film is mainly due to the surface roughness of the polymer film. The polymer surface roughness was characterized by the surface stress which concentrates on the surface topography in the areas of the trough (compression) and crest (tension). These stress variations can affect the electrostatic potential and Fermi level near the vacuum side. Furthermore, the surface roughness can modulate the crystal face orientations. Thus, the work function of the MS@PVA polymer film is higher than that of the bare PVA polymer film. This clearly demonstrates that the difference between the work functions of PVDF and MS@PVA is minimum as compared to PVDF and bare PVA, which is more favorable to achieve maximum charge transfer as well as high output performance of TENGs [48]. Therefore, these results also confirm that MS@PVA and PVDF are more suitable to attain high output performance. The output voltage and current curves generated by the PVDF-MS@PVA-based TENG at various mechanical forces and frequencies are shown in Fig. 5(a–d). To examine the influence of pushing frequency on the output performance of TENG, its electrical output was measured at difference pushing frequencies in the range from 1 to 5 Hz, while the pushing force was maintained at 3 N (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). The measured results are clearly elucidating that the electrical output voltage and current of the proposed TENG device were enhanced by increasing the applied pushing frequency from 1 to 5 Hz, exhibiting a very high value at the frequency of 5 Hz. Such an enhancement in the electrical output of TENG might be observed due to the accumulation of the large number of triboelectric charges across the active materials TENG owing to the faster contact-separation cycles [49,50]. Furthermore, the electrical output voltage of the proposed TENG device is also measured at various pushing forces ranging from 1 to 5 N, as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). The measured peak-to-peak output voltage and current values of the proposed TENG are proportional to the applied mechanical pushing force, which increased with the pushing force applied on the top of the TENG. The enhancement in the electrical output performance of the TENG is mainly attributed to the large distortion or contact force between the active materials of TENG under strong pushing forces, which can lead to the enhanced the triboelectric surface charge density and the improved output performance of TENG. The above results are clearly elucidating that PVDF-MS@PVA-based TENG is beneficial for efficiently harvesting low-frequency and less-sensitive mechanical forces observed in daily human life. The effect of external load resistance on the output performance of the TENG was further investigated by measuring its electrical output at various load resistances ranging from 100 Ω to 1 GΩ, respectively. Since the impedance matching of the TENG with external electrical components plays a crucial role in the utilization of TENGs for practical applications. Fig. 6 (a) and (b) shows the electrical output voltage, current, and power density values of TENG at various external load resistances from 100 Ω to 1 GΩ. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the output voltage of TENG increased step by step with the increase of external load resistance, while the current exhibited a reverse trend. The output power density of PVDF-MS@PVA-based TENG was calculated by the equation of P = I 2 R/A (A is the active area of the electrodes which is 2 × 2 cm2) [49]. At very high and low load resistances, the PVDF-MS@PVA-based TENG exhibited low power density values, whereas it exhibited a maximum value of 3.1 W/m2 at a load resistance of 20 MΩ, which is known as an internal impedance of the proposed PVDF-MS@PVA-based TENG. The electrical output performance as well as the material synthesis procedures used in this work are further compared with the previously reported TENGs. Recently, in the following reports [51–54], the PVA or PVDF was used as the triboelectric polymers to develop TENGs, which are compared with our work in terms of electrical output performance, material synthesis processes, etc. and the main novelty of the proposed TENG device is clearly explained. Sophia Selvarajan et al. developed piezoelectric nanogenerator based on the BaTiO3 NPs embedded PVA polymer and it was used as a self-powered glucose sensor [51]. The fabricated PNG exhibited only 5 V and 900 nA electrical output performance. Yoojeong Park et al. demonstrated the TENG with BaTiO3 multilayer nanocomposites with alternating poly (vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) layers. The device delivered the output voltage, current, and power density of 45 V, 2 μA, and 30 μW/cm2, respectively [52]. Chengmei Jiang et al. fabricated all the electrospun TENG based on the Mxene dispersed PVA nanofiber polymer and silk fibroin nanofiber polymer as negative and positive triboelectric layers, respectively. The TENG exhibited the output voltage, current, and power density values of 190 V, 42 μA, and 1087 mW/m2, respectively [53]. Huidrom Hemojit et al. demonstrated the TENG assembled with ZnO-PVDF and PTFE triboelectric layers, and voltage of 119 V, short circuit current of 1.6 μA, and output power density of 10.6 μW/cm3 were achieved. The electrical output of the proposed TENG with the MS@PVA and PVDF is similar or superior to the previous reports [54]. Moreover, the techniques used in these reports to develop TENGs and their triboelectric materials are complicated, special equipments are required, and fabrication and implementation for large scale production are difficult. Furthermore, the comparison in electrical output performance between the proposed TENG and the previously reported TENGs is also summarized in Table 1 [52–58]. Therefore, comparatively, the electrical output of the proposed TENG with the MS@PVA and PVDF is either similar or superior to the previous reports. Besides, the techniques used in these reports [52–58] to develop TENGs and their triboelectric materials are complicated, special equipments are required, and fabrication and implementation for large scale production are difficult. Eventually, to demonstrate the practical application of a TENG, it was used as a self-power source to drive low-power/portable electronic devices. Nevertheless, the fabricated TENG generates the alternating current (AC) signals, which cannot be used to directly drive the portable electronic devices. So, the AC signals generated by the TENG device should be converted into direct current signals through a full-wave bridge rectifier. Fig. 6(c) depicts the rectified output voltage curve of the proposed TENG device, at the pushing force and frequency of 3 N and 5 Hz, respectively. Also, the rectified electrical signal of TENG was used to store the energy into the traditional capacitor, followed by supplying it to portable electronic devices. Furthermore, to examine the mechanical stability and durability of the TENG device, its electrical output voltage was measured over the period of almost 12 min or 3500 pushing cycles, under the pushing force and frequency of 3 N and 5 Hz, respectively (Fig. 6(d)). There are no significant changes noticed over a long-time operation of the TENG, which can confirm its superior stability and the ability to harvest various types of mechanical energies over a long lifetime. Fig. 6(e) represents the charging curves of different traditional capacitors (0.47, 2.2, 4.7, and 22 μF) charged by the rectified electrical output of the TENG over 100 s. The energy stored into the 10 μF capacitor was further utilized to power up the portable electronic devices with liquid crystal displays (LCDs) like table-top and wristwatches, as shown in Fig. 6(h) and (k). The charging and discharging curves of the 10 μF capacitor while connected to the portable electronic devices are also shown in Fig. S3(a) and (b). Furthermore, the electric output generated by the TENG was directly employed to light up 30 commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs), without any storage systems or external power supplies, as shown in Fig. S3(c). These results are clearly suggesting that the proposed TENG is a potential candidate to employ as a self-powered source for portable electronic devices."
3,Conclusions,"In summary, we demonstrated the, simple, cost-effective, and portable TENG assembled with an inexpensive and facile PVDF and MS@PVA films as the triboelectric positive and negative layers. The PVDF and MS@PVA-based TENG exhibited a relatively high electrical output compared to the TENG with the PVDF and bare PVA films, owing to the high surface roughness introduced by the microstructures on the surface of PVA film. Resultantly, the PVDF and MS@PVA-based TENG revealed the electrical output voltage and current values of 230 V and 6 μA, respectively which are higher than the TENG with the PVDF and only bare PVA film (175 V and 3.5 μA). Moreover, it showed the output power density of 3.1 W/m2 at 20 MΩ. In particular, owing to the simple and cost-effective fabrication method, the PVDF and MS@PVA-based TENG has high merits in energy harvesting and practical applications with high mechanical stability. Lastly, the PVDF and MS@PVA-based TENG demonstrated the utilization of potential applications in portable electronic devices such as electronic displays."
