0,Introduction,"Nanocrystalline tungsten-oxide shows efficient photocatalytic behaviour even under excitation by visible light [1]. The photon produces a pair of an electron and a hole, which creates free radicals to undergo subsequent oxidation and reduction reactions. WO3 particles with nanometre sizes and fine crystallinity therefore may be used for smart, cost-effective treatment of waste-water, for degradation of harmful dyes and other organic compounds, using a simple visible light source or just sun-light. Nanometric tungsten-oxide also possess efficient antibacterial properties [2,3]. Tungsten-oxide nanoparticles with very small sizes may kill bacteria by directly penetrating the cell membrane, or through the emission of metallic ions. The bactericidal effect may be enhanced under the exposure of light because photo-catalysis produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may inhibit bacterial growth by inducing oxidative stress. Inorganic antibacterial materials are in-general more attractive because they most often have nonspecific toxicity mechanisms, stable in harsh environments and less expensive [2,4]. Tungsten-oxide nanomaterial in particular is known to have stable physiochemical properties and was demonstrated to be less toxic to mammalian cells [2]. Metal oxide nanoparticles may remove harmful dyes also by the surface adsorption process that may lead to achieving multi-functionality during treatment of waste water [5]. Some yet other applications of this chemically inert and highly stable nanomaterial include, for Hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) by water splitting [6,7], as gas-sensors [8], in electrochromic and photochromic devices [9], in dye-sensitized solar cells [10], etc. However, for most of the nanomaterials mediated projected applications, the absence of a synthesis technique with a bulk production rate is often the bottleneck for the successful adoption of the processes. This is especially true for the nanomaterials to be used for water treatment, which require materials in large amounts ideally processed through an inexpensive, fast technique. This is also critical for large scale adoption of the HER process for the production of hydrogen as an alternative, clean fuel, which also is in search of a viable catalytic material for water splitting reactions that can replace expensive and scarce noble metals [11]. Tungsten-oxide nanoparticles were experimentally synthesized by a large number of different techniques, including hydrothermal method, solvothermal method, sol–gel technique, laser deposition, electro-deposition, chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, RF sputtering, spin-coating and plasma-assisted processes [12]. Thermal plasma assisted techniques also were extensively utilized for the controlled synthesis of nanometric tungsten-oxide [13–18]. As a processing medium, thermal plasma has the advantages of high production rate due to the intense energy density and enhanced product crystallinity because of the very high-temperature regime [19,20]. In a plasma reactor, nucleated particles may get quickly charged up collecting more mobile plasma electrons that may suppress particle growth processes, leading to production of monodispersed particles with very small average sizes [20]. Plasma techniques are also more environment friendly as they can most often avoid using wet chemical reactants in favour of less hazardous dry substances [21]. Moreover, thermal plasma assisted production techniques are most often single-step processes. However, very rarely the actual rate of production of the nanomaterials was reported in the journal papers. Synthesis of rod-like tungsten-oxide nanomaterial was reported in a transferred arc assisted system, with the rate of production of up to ten grams per hour, which however had wide size distribution [22]. J. Liu et al. [1] reported a solvothermal, synthesis process of ultrathin W18O49 nanowires by decomposition of tungstic acid, which produced about one gram of nanomaterial, through an elaborate multi-step process. More recently, using an underwater plasma, WO3 nanoparticles were reported to be produced at about twenty-five grams per hour [18]. We here report a novel segmented-arc assisted experimental plasma chemical reactor configuration, for the synthesis of tungsten-oxide nanomaterials in bulk amounts, with very small average sizes and without mixed with large aggregated lumps of particles. This is achieved by producing an argon/oxygen plasma beam with a large cross-section and its controlled interaction with a remotely placed tungsten target. The target surface gets rapidly oxidized, which sublimate as soon as it is formed, from which tungsten oxide nanoparticles are nucleated. Their functional properties were investigated, including photocatalytic response of the synthesized nanoparticles for degradation of Rhodamine-B dye, which is one of the most important xanthene dyes, used as a biologicalfluorescent stain, tracing agent, solar collector, paper and laser dye. The state of mineralization of the dye was measured by chemical oxygen demand (COD) and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Antibacterial characteristics of the nanomaterial were examined against gram-negative bacteria E. coli that is found most commonly in waste-water. The HER performance of the tungsten oxide nanoparticle samples was also studied. Investigated the plasma chemistry of the jet interacting with the tungsten target plate by optical emission spectroscopy (OES), for diagnostics of the plasma and also to identify the active radicals that were responsible for the enhanced oxidation reactions in presence of the argon/oxygen plasma."
1,Experimental method,
2,The segmented arc assisted plasma chemical reactor,"2.1 The segmented arc assisted plasma chemical reactor The plasma chemical reactor consists of a horizontal, stainless-steel made, double-walled, water-cooled vacuum chamber of 40 cm in diameter and 70 cm in length. A segmented DC plasma torch is connected vertically to this chamber, which has the advantage of producing a very high density, highly stable flowing plasma jet (Fig. 1 ). The torch has a thoriated tungsten cathode and four numbers of copper ring segments separated by teflon gaskets and a copper anode at the bottom, each of which is water-cooled by passing eight litres per minute (lpm) of water at 2.5 bar pressure. The chamber is pumped down with a 1500 lpm rotary vacuum pump, gas flow rates were controlled by Alborg made mass flow controllers and the ambient pressure is measured with a digital Pirani pressure gauge. A DC thyristorized power supply (200 V/400 A) with a high-frequency igniter is used to operate the plasma source. The tungsten (PLANSEE, 1 mm thick, 25 mm square sides) target plate is placed under the plasma torch, attached with a water-cooled, copper made target holder. For deciding the distance between the torch and the tungsten target, the most important considerations were: they should be far apart so that the damaging reflected plasma flows are minimum, synthesized nanomaterials deposit all around uniformly over the inside surface of the water-cooled vacuum chamber, and lastly plasma diagnostics may be conveniently arranged in between to study the plasma/tungsten interaction process. Considering the actual size of the vacuum chamber, this distance was finally optimized as 15 cm. A piece of graphoil is kept in between the target and the holder for better thermal contact. A collimated plasma jet is produced as shown in Fig. 1, which interacts downstream with the material target. The temperature of the target is measured with a K-type thermocouple that is pressed on the metal plate from below. 15 lpm of argon is used as the plasma forming gas, while molecular oxygen gas is fed at an additional torch ring inserted downstream of the torch anode. First, the argon plasma jet is produced followed by injection of oxygen, immediately after which all exposed parts inside the chamber including the walls get covered with a thick layer of powder. Initiating plasma operation at 130 A (6.3 kW), it was observed that the rate of synthesis of the nanopowders was increasing with increasing input power, but the maximum plasma current was limited to 250 A (13.7 kW) considering the stability of the plasma and ease of operation. The reactive gas used was optimized by measuring the corresponding material production rate against four different discrete values of oxygen flow rates as follows: 1 lpm, 5 lpm, 10 lpm and 15 lpm. The rate of production of the powder was highest for the 10 lpm of oxygen, therefore all samples reported in this paper were synthesized under that condition only. Synthesis experiments are carried out continuously for a minute, after which the vacuum chamber is opened for sample collection. Blue powder deposited on the water-cooled walls of the vacuum chamber, which was scrapped-off and stored in a single container. Yellow powder is deposited on the relatively hot target-holder, which was collected and stored separately. However, this sample is produced at a much lesser proportion, weight-wise it is about 3% of the blue powder. Total rate of synthesis of these two different powder samples together was estimated at about 200 g/h. This was measured by collecting and weighing the powder materials that deposited on the inside walls of the vacuum chamber and the substrate holder, for certain duration of operation of the reactor. The blue powder was further annealed in a tubular alumina furnace at 400°C for one hour, during which its colour had changed from blue to yellow."
3,"Characterization of the plasma and studies on plasma chemistry by optical emission spectroscopy, measurement of heat-flux by water-calorimeter","2.2 Characterization of the plasma and studies on plasma chemistry by optical emission spectroscopy, measurement of heat-flux by water-calorimeter Just above the plasma beam interacted with the tungsten target, it was diagnosed by OES techniques. Measurements were undertaken using a McPherson made, very high resolution (0.007 nm) monochromator fitted with an 1800 g/mm grating and Newton 940 spectroscopic CCD camera (2048 × 512 array of 13.5 μm pixels). The plasma light was collected by lenses and long optical fibres. A small amount of hydrogen was mixed with the plasma argon and the electron density was measured from the Stark broadening of the Hβ emission line at 486.2 nm. The plasma temperature was estimated from the Boltzmann Plot using the following atomic emission lines of argon: 727.3 nm, 738.4 nm, 750.4 nm, 772.4 nm and 794.8 nm. High-resolution OES was performed also to understand the plasma chemistry, to identify the active species that may be responsible for enhanced oxidation reactions in presence of a plasma jet. The average heat-flux deposited by the plasma beam on the remote tungsten target plate was measured with a water calorimeter of 2 cm diameter, made of copper and stainless steel, which was placed perpendicular to the laminar plasma beam during the measurements. Power absorbed by the calorimeter is estimated by measuring the temperature difference between the incoming and outgoing water (PT100) and from the corresponding water flow rate."
4,Characterization of the synthesized nanomaterials,"2.3 Characterization of the synthesized nanomaterials The phases of the as-synthesized and annealed nanomaterials were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (ULTIMA IV, Rigaku). Average crystallite sizes were estimated from the width of the diffraction peaks using Scherrer’s equation. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL JEM-2100 at 200 kV) was used to study the size and shape of the synthesized particles. The samples were first sonicated in ethanol and then deposited on carbon-coated copper grids for imaging. Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) served in reconfirming the phases and material crystallinity. The state of aggregation of the fine powders was studied by taking field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) photographs of the particles at a relatively larger scale length encompassing several micrometers (JEOL JSM-7100F). Product purity and atomic composition were checked with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 220 XL Spectrometer). The specific surface area and pore volume distribution were measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) technique in a static volumetric adsorption surface area analyzer system using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm (Quantachrome Autosorb iQ). The optical bandgap energy of the material was measured using a UV–Visible spectrometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Japan) at diffuse reflectance mode, using Kubelka-Munk technique, where [F(R∞) × E]1/2 is plotted versus photon energy. The bandgap can be deduced from a linear part of the spectra using a linear fitting method. Here, R∞ is the absolute reflectance of the sample at infinite thickness and F(R∞) is the conversion of the diffuse reflectance measurements R∞ to F(R∞) according to the following equation: F (R∞) = (1 − R∞) 2 /2R∞ ."
5,Photocatalytic characterization of the synthesized powder samples for dye degradation,"2.4 Photocatalytic characterization of the synthesized powder samples for dye degradation Photocatalytic characteristics of all the three different plasma synthesized nanomaterial samples were studied based on their performance for the degradation of the Rhodamine-B dye, under irradiation of visible light. An in-house built solar simulator was utilized for these studies, with an 80-Watt LED lamp, having an average visible light intensity of 400 mW/cm2 (Centre for the Environment, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati). Initially, 20 ppm of dye solution was prepared in 100 ml of distilled water in a quartz beaker, to which 20 mg of tungsten-oxide photocatalyst sample was added. Before irradiation, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to get adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and the dye. After this, to this suspension 20 ml of 0.1 M Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added with lights illuminated.H2O2 can enhance photocatalytic reactions by promoting production of the hydroxyl radicals. Small samples were collected from this solution after certain time intervals, centrifuged (at 10000 rpm speed for 10 min) and UV–Vis spectrum was immediately taken. The concentration of Rhodamine-B was analysed by recording the absorbance at its characteristic peak of 554 nm, using a UV−Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Model no. UV-1900). The mineralization of the dye was studied using Waters Alliance HPLC (Waters 2695, Separation module), equipped with photodiode array detector, using Luna C18 reversed-phase column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, particle size 5 µm, pore size 100 Å, Phenomenex, Torrance, USA), at a fixed temperature of 37 °C. The HPLC separation was done using a mobile phase (CH3CN: H2O = 1:1 by volume, H3PO4 = 50 mM, pH = 3.5). The detection of degraded product was carried out at λ = 554 nm at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. COD content was measured using APHA 23rd edition 5220C protocol (closed reflux method). The reaction mixture was centrifuged before HPLC and COD analysis to isolate the catalyst particle and supernatant solution."
6,Measurements on the antibacterial property of the synthesized tungsten-oxide nanomaterials,"2.5 Measurements on the antibacterial property of the synthesized tungsten-oxide nanomaterials The antibacterial property of the annealed yellow powder sample was studied against the pathogenic bacteria E. coli. The nanoparticle-mediated bactericidal activity was quantified through the inhibitory effect at different concentrations of the nanoparticles on bacterial growth. Liquid culture assay and plate count methods were applied for this study. The bacterial inoculum was prepared in Luria Bertani (LB) broth and kept overnight at 37°C. Later, the 1% (v/v) enriched inoculum was incubated in the presence of a varying concentration of nanoparticles (0 to 1 mg/mL) in LB broth at 180 rpm and 37°C for 12 h in a shaker incubator. Afterward, the decrease in bacterial growth was evaluated based on the measurement of the reduced optical density (OD) at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. Further, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of nanoparticles against bacteria was measured as the minimum concentration of the nanoparticles, required for the inhibition of the bacterial growth [23]. In addition, the bacterial inhibition (%) was evaluated using the following equation: Ba c t e r i a l g r o w t h i n h i b i t i o n % = OD c - OD n OD c × 100 where ODc stands for the optical density of the bacterial suspension without nanoparticles (control) and ODn is the optical densities of the bacterial suspension with the different concentrations of nanoparticles [24]. The IC50 value was also estimated as the concentration of nanoparticles required for the 50% inhibition of bacterial growth. Later, the 12 h incubated bacterial cultures with different nanoparticle concentrations were diluted by a series of 8-folds (10-8 times) in sterile distilled water, and further 100 µl were spread onto LB agar plates with control as per plate count assay [25]. The plates were incubated at 37°C, until countable bacterial colonies were visible. Afterward, the plates were recovered and thus formed bacterial colonies were counted. The visible colonies were observed in control (at 0 mg/mL of nanoparticles concentration) after 36 h, while in experimental sets (0.05 to 1 mg/mL of nanoparticles) they were seen only after 72 h. The decrease in bacterial colonies count was recorded."
7,Measurements on the hydrogen evolution reaction activity of the synthesized tungsten-oxide nanomaterials,"2.6 Measurements on the hydrogen evolution reaction activity of the synthesized tungsten-oxide nanomaterials Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical setup (Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT204 potentiostat/galvanostat) with Ag/AgCl (satd. KCl) as a reference and platinum foil (1 cm2) as a counter electrode, for the as-synthesized blue and the annealed yellow powders. The electrocatalyst modified Glassy Carbon Electrode (GCE) (3 mm diameter) was used as working electrode. The electrolyte used was 0.5 M H2SO4. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), in a frequency range of 104 Hz to 10-1 Hz was carried out using a Potentiostat (Princeton applied research PARSTAT 2273). The impedance data were analysed using Zsimp Win software (Version 3.21). All the potentials reported in this work are against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which has been converted from the measured potentials against Ag/AgCl (satd. KCl) using the following equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + E0+ (0.0591 × pH). Before catalyst loading, the GCE was polished by rubbing it in a slurry of 0.3 µm alumina over a nylon pad and sonicated for 15 min in acetone. The catalyst slurry was prepared by mixing the solution of 10 µl Nafion (Sigma Aldrich) + 1 ml IPA (isopropyl alcohol) + 2 mg electrocatalyst. The solution was sonicated for 30 min to form the catalyst slurry. 10 µl of the prepared slurry was drop casted over the working area of the GCE and dried overnight under ambient conditions. The linear sweep voltammograms (LSV, 5 mVs−1), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and impedance measurements were performed in 0.5 M H2SO4. Impedance measurements were performed on three over-potentials, one below the onset potential, second between the onset potential and ɳ10 and third at the ɳ10. ɳ10 is a benchmarking over-potential at which 10 mA/cm2 can be achieved, which is 10% efficiency of solar water-splitting devices. LSV was done in a range of 0 V to −1 V. In a control experiment similar LSV experiment has been performed over a bare GCE to evaluate the change in onset as well as ɳ10 potentials. LSV curve has also been used to study the kinetics of HER activity. Electrochemical active surface area (EASA) determined by cyclic voltammetry method in a non-faradic region (-0.2 V to 0.2 V vs. RHE)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the synthesized powder,"3.1 Characterization of the synthesized powder Fig. 2 shows the x-ray diffraction patterns of the three different plasma synthesized material samples, two as-synthesized powders with blue and yellow colour and a yellow-coloured annealed sample (400˚C, for one hour). XRD confirms them to be tungsten trioxide (WO3) in the stable, monoclinic phase-structure, with lattice parameters as follows: a = 7.297 Å, b = 7.539 Å, c = 7.688 Å (JCPDS PDF no. 00–043-1035). The following peaks (2θ value) were identified against the corresponding crystal planes: 23.1 (002), 23.6 (020), 24.3 (200), 26.6 (120), 28.7 (112), 33.5 (022), 34.2 (202), 41.9 (222), 47.2 (004) and 49.8 (400). The inter-planar d-spacing, corresponding to the following planes (002), (020) and (200), are estimated as 0.385 nm, 0.377 nm and 0.366 nm respectively. However, for the as-synthesized blue and the annealed samples, there is little shift from the standard peak values. XRD also confirms there is no impurity mixed with the synthesized material in major amounts. The crystallite sizes were estimated using Scherrer’s formula for the most intense peak, i.e. (002) plane. The crystallite sizes are found to be 17.3 nm, 36.1 nm and 20.8 nm for the as-synthesized blue powder, as-synthesized yellow powder and annealed yellow powder respectively. The crystallite size of the annealed yellow tungsten-oxide powder, which was processed through a relatively longer, two-step process, was smaller than the size of the as-synthesized yellow powder. TEM micrograph of the as-synthesized blue sample shows lightly agglomerating nanoparticles, having irregular, spherical and rectangular morphologies, with sizes from few to few tens of nanometers (Fig. 3 (a)). Some rod like morphologies were also seen in some micrographs of this sample (Fig. 3(b)). TEM of the annealed powder shows the presence of rectangular single-crystals in higher proportion and very less size growth compared to the blue sample (Fig. 3(c)). In the TEM micrograph of the as-synthesized yellow sample, sheet like irregular structures is observed remaining mixed with the smaller nanoparticles (Fig. 3(d)). HRTEM micrograph of the annealed yellow sample shows the well crystalline atomic planes (Fig. 3(e)), from where two different atomic lattice spacings were identified as 0.33 nm and 0.36 nm, which should correspond to the (120) and (200) crystal plane of tungsten oxide, which were already identified by XRD before. However, for none of the tungsten-oxide nanomaterial sample, constructing the detailed size-distribution from their corresponding TEM micrographs was possible, because of their agglomerating nature. In Fig. 3(f), we present SAED pattern of the as-synthesized yellow powder, which reconfirms the presence of the following crystal planes of tungsten-oxide: (112), (202), (222), and (004). HRTEM and SAED measurements also confirm that the annealed sample has the best overall material crystallinity followed by the as-synthesized yellow powder. FESEM micrograph of the as-synthesized yellow powder reconfirms the presence of sheet like structures, with maximum sizes up to about one micro-meter (Fig. 4 (a)). The corresponding micrograph of the as-synthesized blue sample shows individual, almost spherical nanoparticles, although some linear, agglomerating particle lumps were also seen in the FESEM micrograph. However, the annealed yellow powder was observed to be devoid of any large aggregates, although light necking with the nearest neighbouring particles may not be ruled out (Fig. 4(b)). Comparing these FESEM micrographs, it can be concluded that out of the two yellow powder samples, the annealed one is characterized with a narrower size distribution. Fig. 5 (a) shows a complete XPS survey scan of the as-synthesized yellow coloured tungsten oxide nanoparticles. The electron binding energy peaks at 36.3, 248.1, 260.6, 428.4, 496.8 eV correspond to 4f7/2, 4d5/2, 4d3/2, 4p3/2, 4p1/2 of tungsten [26]. The spectrum also shows carbon at 285.2 eV, which might be contamination collected during exposure of the sample to atmosphere during sample collection and just before the measurements [26]. The narrow scan XPS spectrum of the two as-synthesized tungsten-oxide powder samples corresponding to the W 4f core level is shown in Fig. 5(b) and 5(c). For the as-synthesized yellow powder (Fig. 5(b)), the de-convoluted peaks at 35.25 eV and 37.35 eV represent W+6 state corresponding to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 respectively of stoichiometric tungsten oxide [27]. The spin–orbit splitting of the doublet is 2.1 eV, which is the characteristic energy difference of the W 4f state [26,27]. For the blue powder sample (Fig. 5(c)), the W4f can be de-convoluted into four peaks, out of which ones at 35.03 eV and 37.17 eV once again represent W+6 state of WO3. On the other hand, the peaks at 33.83 eV and 35.98 eV of the blue powder, represents W+5 state, corresponding to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of non-stoichiometric tungsten oxide, with the same spin orbit splitting of 2.1 eV [27]. From the area under the peaks of + 6 and + 5 state of W 4f, we measured their ratio as 6.869, from which the stoichiometry of the as-synthesized blue powder is estimated as WO2.936 [28]. The narrow scan spectrum of the as synthesized yellow and blue powder for O1s core level are presented in Fig. 5(d) and 5(e), in each of which peaks are fitted with two components. For the as-synthesized yellow powder, the peak at 530.23 eV corresponds to W-O bond and the other peak at 531.73 eV corresponds to the –OH group, which arises due to atmospheric contamination. For the as-synthesized blue powder, those peaks are located at 530.05 eV and 531.55 eV respectively [29]. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption curves for the annealed yellow and as-synthesized blue nanomaterial samples exhibit type IV isotherm (IUPAC classification) characteristic of mesoporous materials (Fig. 6 ). The annealed sample was measured to have an average pore volume of 0.084 cc/g, contributed by the mesopores with average pore diameter of 6.30 nm, and specific surface area of 16.70 m2/g. In the case of the as-synthesized blue powder sample, the average pore volume was larger at 0.237 cc/g, contributed by smaller mesopores with average sizes of 3.75 nm and 5.15 nm, and the specific surface area was much larger at 70.14 m2/g. Annealing resulted in better material crystallinity but decreased porosity of the material. The optical properties of the tungsten-oxide nanomaterial samples are measured by UV–Visible spectroscopy. In Fig. 7 , the absorption spectra are plotted, which are obtained from UV–Visible spectra taken in diffuse reflectance mode (R) and converted to the Kubelka-Munk function F(R) to separate the extent of absorption light from scattering. Absorption edge and band-gap energy measured for the three different tungsten-oxide nanomaterial samples are recorded in Table 1 . It is seen that the absorption edge of the annealed sample extends up to 561 nm, whereas for the as-synthesized blue and yellow samples they are 490 and 429 nm only. Thus, annealed tungsten oxide nanoparticles can absorb solar energy over a relatively broad range in the visible region as compared to the as-synthesized tungsten oxide samples."
10,A novel plasma chemical green reactor configuration for bulk synthesis of tungsten-oxide nanoparticles,"3.2 A novel plasma chemical green reactor configuration for bulk synthesis of tungsten-oxide nanoparticles In this experiment, the ambient pressure in the vacuum chamber is maintained at about 20 mbar, while the pressure inside the torch plasma channel is several hundreds of mbar. Because of this pressure difference, the plasma jet coming out of the torch anode expands into the bottom vacuum chamber at supersonic velocity. The expansion continues till a shock is produced, after which the plasma propagates with a beam-like configuration, having a broad, frozen structure with uniform diameter. For 250 A (13.7 kW) plasma current, the visible diameter of the straight plasma beam was about 30 mm. This plasma beam interacts with a tungsten target plate (square with 25 mm sides, 1 mm thickness) kept below at a distance of 15 cm from the torch anode, in a controlled, uniform manner. In order to understand the formation mechanism of the metal-oxide nanomaterial, it may be first noted that powders had formed even at 130 A (6.3 kW) plasma current, for which the target temperature was measured as 1240˚C with a K-type thermocouple. We know the evaporation temperature of tungsten is very high (5555˚C), therefore particles did not condense directly from the metallic tungsten vapour. At 250 A (13.7 kW) plasma current, the target temperature could not be measured, as it was higher than the maximum value the K-type thermocouple was capable of measuring. For confirmation that tungsten did not evaporate even at 250 A plasma current, in a separate experiment in the same device tungsten was irradiated under the exposure of a simple argon plasma jet without adding any oxygen, at the same power. No deposition of any fine particles was observed, which otherwise would have condensed if there was any presence of tungsten vapor near the interaction region. Plasma emission from the interaction zone was analyzed with a high-resolution spectrometer (0.007 nm), which also did not see line emission from any evaporated tungsten atoms. Habainy et al. [30] reported that when exposed in a unionized, low oxygen partial pressure (5 ppm) environment, a thin and adherent oxide dark-blue or black film (WO2.72) is formed on a disc shaped tungsten target even at a temperature of 500 ˚C. Bright yellow colored porous tungsten-oxide is observed when the target temperature is about 600 ˚C [30]. Under the action of a remote plasma jet, it was observed before that oxidation of a tungsten thin film was initiated at a relatively lower target temperature of 425°C [31]. In presence of a low temperature pure O2 plasma, tungsten was reported to get rapidly oxidized at a temperature of 300 ˚C [32]. This laboratory had previously demonstrated that in presence of a neutral oxidizing atmosphere, oxidation of tungsten nanoparticles is initiated even below 200˚C [33]. It may be therefore concluded from this discussion that under the irradiation of the plasma jet at a temperature beyond 1240 ˚C in this current experiment, the hot tungsten plate had got rapidly oxidized, to form a top layer of tungsten-oxide. However, it is also known that bulk tungsten-oxide starts sublimating at a temperature above 750 ˚C [34]. Sublimation of tungsten-oxide nanoparticles starts just beyond 600 ˚C [33]. Moreover, as the temperature of the tungsten target increases, the rate of sublimation of the oxides may even outdo the rate of the oxidation of the metal, which several previous studies did indicate may occur in the broad range of temperatures between 1100 and 1300 ˚C [30]. Perkins and Crooks [34] had observed that the temperature at which the tungsten-oxide evaporates as fast as it forms is dependent also on the ambient pressure, which enhances with increasing pressure. They measured that for pressure in the range of 1 to 40 mm of Hg, tungsten-oxide sublimates as fast as it is formed beyond 1250˚C. It may be therefore concluded, during the present experiment at 250 A plasma current, tungsten-oxide is sublimated as soon as it is formed by oxidation of tungsten metal. The tungsten-oxide vapour undergoes a rapid cooling as it moves out of the plasma beam, out of which nanocrystals of tungsten-oxide are nucleated through homogeneous condensation, and are finally deposited on the inside wall of the chamber and also on the target holder. Using an expanded plasma beam with large cross-section in this case ensures rapid oxidation and subsequent evaporation of tungsten-oxides uniformly from the entire top surface of the target, which leads to synthesis with bulk production rate. Utilizing a focused plasma beam or a transferred arc, instead of an expanded arc, would have resulted in explosive, uncontrolled evaporation of the target material, which would have led to the production of nanomaterials with a wide distribution of sizes [15,16,35]. Water cooling of the target and using graphoil sheets for better contact has provided further control, as we had confirmed that without cooling the material did not evaporate smoothly from the exposed target surface. In presence of the controlled conditions, the target plate was seen to get consumed always very uniformly all across the surface, without leaving behind unusable residue metal. Smaller average size and narrow size distribution of the tungsten-oxide nanoparticles ensures bigger surface area will be available for the catalytic reactions to occur more efficiently. In the case of the photo-generated charge carriers originated deep inside a nanoparticle, being smaller will reduce the possibility of their unwanted recombination before reaching the particle surface, where only useful reactions can occur [36]. Particles with a narrow size distribution should have better dispersion stability while remaining in a solution, which is likely to be important from the perspective of various applications. Sheet like structures were seen in the as-synthesized tungsten-oxide yellow powder, must be because the relatively higher temperature of the substrate holder had promoted grain growth processes. No undesired, harmful by-products were co-produced during the synthesis process; therefore, it may be termed as a green plasma chemical technique. It is known that materials processed through DC thermal plasma assisted techniques may get contaminated due to the uncontrolled erosion of the torch electrodes [20]. However, we have been using the same segmented plasma torch configuration for synthesis of different high temperature nanomaterials for a long time, but electrode impurities were never observed in any of those experiments that were operated almost in the same power range as the present reactor [37]. We also reconfirmed the rate of production of the nanomaterials by this experimental plasma chemical reactor, from the measurement of the mass loss of the target plate during synthesis experiments of certain durations. On average how many oxygen atoms were combined with a lost W atom was estimated based on the characterization data of our samples by XRD and XPS techniques. Production rate estimated this way conformed very well with that measured before from the physical collection of the deposited nanomaterials. Another important issue for a thermal plasma assisted reactor is the average consumption of electric power; for example, during a triple plasma synthesis of boron nitride nanotubes, M. Kim et al. reported that one kW per hour was consumed to synthesize 0.59 g of the nanomaterial [19]. For experimental synthesis of tungsten-oxide nanoparticles by an arc assisted method, the corresponding value was estimated as 5.6 g h-1kW−1 [22]. During the current experiment, one kW consumption of power led to the generation of 14.6 g of the tungsten-oxide nanoparticles in one hour."
11,Optical emission spectroscopy and water-calorimetric studies of the plasma chemical reactor,"3.3 Optical emission spectroscopy and water-calorimetric studies of the plasma chemical reactor The argon-oxygen plasma beam interacting with the W target was studied with an optical spectrometer with very high resolution (0.007 nm), first for measurement of the plasma parameters in the interaction region and also to identify the active plasma species populating the remote plasma beam. A small amount of hydrogen (0.15 lpm) was introduced into the plasma and from the Stark broadening of the Hβ optical emission line, the peak ion density just above the tungsten plate was estimated as 7.1 × 1020 m−3. This is an extremely high plasma density as compared with other plasma assisted systems typically used for material processing. Plasma temperature was also measured from the Boltzmann plot as 0.47 eV. Heat-flux that the plasma beam delivers on the target was measured with a 2 cm diameter water calorimeter as 3.5 MWm−2. The rate of oxidation of tungsten and its concurrent sublimation was measured, in this experiment at 130 A (6.3 kW) plasma current and for a target temperature of 1240˚C, as 3.5 g1cm-2h−1, during which the oxygen partial pressure was maintained at about 10 mbar. For comparison of this plasma assisted rate of reaction, with the corresponding one where the metal is oxidized in a simple gaseous non-ionizing environment, a similar tungsten plate was next heated up in a vacuum furnace in presence of molecular oxygen gas, under the identical conditions of the oxygen partial pressure and target temperature. In the latter case, the rate of tungsten oxidation and the evaporation of the oxides was measured as 0.52 g1cm-2h−1, which was substantially smaller compared to the experiment under plasma exposure. Gulbransen et al. [38] had carried out extensive studies in a similar direction, who had estimated tungsten oxidation and its sublimation rate under neutral heating as 0.75 g1cm-2h−1 at 1250°C and 50 mbar oxygen partial pressure. These results strongly indicate enhanced production of tungsten-oxide by the present plasma-assisted method as compared to neutral oxygen gas heating. In a previous study, enhanced oxidation of molybdenum under irradiation in a low-pressure plasma assisted system, was explained as happening due to the presence of the highly reactive ionic oxygen species like O2 +, O- and O3 – [39]. However, the ion-assisted chemistry is likely to be less significant in a high-pressure thermal plasma assisted system like the present experiment, especially in this remote plasma configuration, where the neutral long-lived species like atomic or molecular oxygen only are likely to dominate the chemistry in the downstream plasma jet [31,40]. However, no emission could be detected corresponding to oxygen-ions and molecular-oxygen during this experiment, although the following emission lines from atomic-oxygen were routinely observed, one triplet (777.19 nm, 777.42 nm and 777.54 nm) and another atomic line at 844.6 nm. So, it was speculated that the presence of the highly reactive atomic oxygen-radicals was responsible for the enhanced oxidation of tungsten in the present experimental system. But, in the present experiment electron temperature is not large enough for electron impact dissociation of molecular oxygen. However, it was demonstrated before in the context of a similar segmented plasma arc produced plasma jet that when oxygen is added downstream of the anode, atomic oxygen radicals are produced by a charge exchange reaction, followed by dissociative recombination, as detailed below [41]: (1) Ar++O2 → O2 + (*) + Ar (*), kCE = 6 × 10-17 m3s−1 (2) O2 ++e → O + O (*), kDR = 1 × 10-13 m3s−1 The atomic line emissions results from the de-excitation of the O(*) radicals. During the current experiment, it was observed that the intensity of the atomic lines was first increasing with an increasing rate of injection of the oxygen gas downstream of the torch anode (Fig. S1, Supplementary material). The rate coefficient for the charge exchange reaction in reaction (1) above is very small, but a massive initial argon ion density ensured that still more molecular oxygen was dissociated into oxygen atomic radicals when the injection rate of gaseous oxygen was increased starting from 1 lpm. A declining trend was seen in the intensity of the oxygen atomic emissions beyond 10 lpm of oxygen injection, which must be because argon ions were not available in sufficient amounts for further charge exchange reactions. The rate of production of the tungsten-oxide powder was also the highest for the 10 lpm of oxygen injection condition, which may be considered as a confirmation of our hypothesis that atomic oxygen was responsible for the enhanced oxidation reactions. The thermal plasma jet with very high heat-flux contributed in terms of quickly heating up the target to a very high temperature, which favorably influenced the kinetics of the reactions."
12,Photocatalytic characterization of the synthesized nanomaterials for degradation of Rhodamine-B dye,"3.4 Photocatalytic characterization of the synthesized nanomaterials for degradation of Rhodamine-B dye Photocatalytic characteristics of the synthesized nanomaterial samples were evaluated based on their degradation capacity of the harmful dye Rhodamine-B. 20 ppm of dye solution was prepared in 100 ml of distilled water in a quartz beaker, to which 20 mg of tungsten-oxide photocatalyst sample was added. It was kept for 30 min in dark for reaching adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Hydrogen-peroxide, as an oxidizing agent is added to the solution for enhancing the efficiency of the photocatalytic reactions, after which the solution is exposed under the visible light solar simulator [42]. For photocatalytic measurements reported here, this moment is considered as time zero. Fig. 8 (a) depicts the change in the characteristic absorption band of the dye at 554 nm in presence of the annealed yellow colored tungsten-oxide nanopowder sample, which demonstrates it was diminishing with increasing time of exposure. Spectral curves for the as-synthesized yellow powder sample are presented in the supplementary material (Fig. S2). Both of the nanomaterial samples demonstrated efficient photocatalytic behaviour for degradation of the Rhodamine-B dye. Dye solutions in presence of the nanomaterial samples were almost completely degraded in about 2.5 h after initiation of the radiation exposure. The time resolved dye concentration profile corresponding to both of the samples is presented in Fig. 8(b), which shows the rate of degradation was little faster, at least initially for the annealed tungsten-oxide yellow nanopowder. The concentration of the dye had decreased also during the first thirty minutes in darkness due to the surface adsorption processes. It was also confirmed during these experiments that there is negligible dye degradation in the presence of hydrogen-peroxide alone, without the addition of the nanopowders. Photocatalytic experiments are carried out also for the as-synthesized blue tungsten-oxide nanomaterial sample, but the results are not consistent, therefore they are not reported here. HPLC chromatograms were recorded for four numbers of dye solutions: bare 20 ppm Rhodium-B dye solution (Only dye), nanoparticle-irradiation degraded dye solution, at 90 min, 150 min and 240 min. They are presented in Fig. S3 in supplementary material, which show the dye identified at retention time of 5.46 min of the top chromatogram, decomposes in to multiple intermediates as time progresses. Intensity or area of the peaks in the subsequent chromatograms decrease drastically, from which it may be concluded that mineralization was almost complete and possibility of toxicity arising due to the dye intermediate products may be negligible [43]. In conformity to this analysis, the COD of the dye solution at 240 min was measured to get reduced by 80% compared to the initial bare dye solution. It is known that tungsten-oxide in pure form does not demonstrate efficient photo-catalytic behavior, because of the quick recombination of the photo-generated charge carriers and because the electrons at its conduction band cannot be proficiently trapped by O2 to yield superoxide radicals. In literature, precious co-catalysts like platinum nanoparticles were used for producing composites, which serve as a pool for electrons that can efficiently catalyze the reduction of oxygen molecules, producing abundant radicals that quickly degrade the target organic compounds [44]. In this present experiment, hydrogen-peroxide was added that also promotes degradation reactions by producing more radicals. Superior conductivity of the highly crystalline tungsten-oxide nanoparticles must have ensured faster separation of the charges created by the photons, which successfully suppressed charge recombination and promoted more efficient photocatalytic behavior. The annealed sample had smaller average particle size and narrow size distribution that may be another reason this sample had demonstrated slightly better dye-reduction characteristics compared to the as-synthesized yellow tungsten oxide particles, because that makes available more surface area favorable for the photocatalytic and the adsorption processes. The absorption edge of the annealed sample extends maximum into the visible region of the electro-magnetic spectrum that also must have contributed positively during the photocatalytic experiments. Moreover, it was mentioned before that necking between particles could further reduce conductivity limitations, which once again is a possibility in the case of the annealed powder [36]."
13,Antibacterial property of the synthesized tungsten-oxide nanomaterials,"3.5 Antibacterial property of the synthesized tungsten-oxide nanomaterials We here study the antibacterial properties of the same annealed tungsten oxide nanomaterial sample that was before synthesized in bulk amounts by a two-step process, and which demonstrated efficient photocatalytic performance for the degradation of the Rhodium-B dye. First, following the liquid culture assay technique, E. coli bacterium was incubated for 12 h with different concentrations of the nanoparticle sample. It was observed that the bacterial growth decreased exponentially with increasing concentrations of the nanoparticles (Fig. 9 (a)). The corresponding bacterial inhibition (%) was plotted against nanoparticle concentrations, from 0 to 1.0 mg/mL, as shown in Fig. 9(b). The bar diagram shows the inhibition increases rapidly with increasing nanoparticle concentration, being 74% at 0.2 mg/mL, after which the inhibition slows down. The decrease in OD data was fitted with an exponential decay expression ( O D C = O D 0 e - k c ). Here k and c refer to the decay constant and concentration, respectively. The IC50 value was estimated to be 0.15 ± 0.01 mg/mL. Further, the MIC value was found to be 0.2 mg/mL (200 µg/mL) as a significant inhibition of the bacterial growth was observed at this concentration. The obtained MIC value of nanoparticles was found to be comparable or better with tungsten oxide nanoparticles [45]. The bactericidal property of the same nanomaterial sample was studied further using the plate count assay method, counting bacterial colonies and estimating bacterial viability with increasing tungsten oxide concentrations from 0 to 1.0 mg/mL. Plate photographs treated with different concentrations of nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 10 (a). The bacterial viability curve estimated from the plate count assay is plotted in Fig. 10 (b). The viability of E. coli was reduced to <5 % when treated with only 0.1 mg/mL tungsten-oxide and was zero for nanoparticles concentration ≥0.2 mg/mL. These observations show that the annealed tungsten-oxide nanomaterial demonstrates efficient antibacterial behaviour in a concentration-dependent manner. Antibacterial experiments are carried out under the laboratory ambient light conditions, so it is most likely that photo excitation created ROS inhibited bacterial growth by inducing oxidative stress [46]. It was also mentioned before that nanoparticle with very small sizes may kill bacteria by disrupting the cell membrane. This may also partly explain the germicidal effect of the annealed tungsten-oxide nanomaterial sample during the present experiment, as the average size of the particles in this sample was just about 21 nm and it was also relatively free from a big lump of particles. Duan et al. [2] had demonstrated before that tungsten-oxide nanoparticles can very efficiently kill both gram-positive and negative bacterial by perforating the outer cell surface, but the sizes of their particles were just a few nanometers only. However, in the literature, germicidal capacity demonstrated by metal-oxide nanoparticles of even thirty nanometer average size was ascribed to direct cell damage as confirmed by measurable membrane leakage [47]. Moreover, TEM shows the sample contained a substantial population of particles with individual sizes of less than ten nanometers, which could be more lethal in this regard. Another possibility is that nanomaterial releases ions, which could react with the cell membrane and proteins in the bacterial cells that finally lead to their death [3]."
14,Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the synthesized tungsten-oxide nanomaterials,"3.6 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the synthesized tungsten-oxide nanomaterials The catalytic activity of the annealed yellow and as-synthesized blue nanoparticle samples towards HER have been evaluated in acidic solution. The catalyst surface was activated by giving 30 potentiodynamic cycles in the potential range of 0 to −2 V vs Ag/AgCl before the LSV, which purifies the electrode/catalyst surface from adsorbed impurity. Fig. 11 (a) shows the LSV curve of the bare GCE as well as the as-synthesized blue and annealed yellow powder electrocatalyst modified GCE. The onset potential for the annealed tungsten-oxide sample, needed to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 is 298 mV vs. RHE. The Tafel-plot has been constructed using the LSV data (Fig. 11(b)), which shows Tafel slope for the annealed sample was 67 mV/decade, which is relatively much better compared to the as-synthesized blue sample (230 mV/decade). It is known that the mechanism of HER activity by a catalyst in acidic medium basically involves the following two steps: (a) electrochemical hydrogen adsorption i.e., Volmer reaction and (b) either or both electrochemical hydrogen desorption i.e., Heyrovsky reaction and chemical hydrogen desorption i.e., Tafel reaction [48]. Now, considering the theoretical values of Tafel slope for three different rate-determining reactions, it can be concluded that for the annealed yellow tungsten-oxide nanoparticle sample, the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism is involved, where both transfer of charge, as well as adsorption of hydrogen atom at the catalyst surface, are taking place for the generation of H2 gas [49]. Results from the EIS and EASA measurements are presented in the supplementary materials (including Figs. S4, S5 and S6)."
15,Conclusion,"Tungsten-oxide nanoparticles were synthesized using a novel, green, plasma chemical reactor configuration, with a bulk rate of production up to two hundred grams per hour. The tungsten target plate was rapidly oxidised as it was exposed to an expanded and hot argon plasma jet in presence of oxygen. The tungsten-oxide sublimated just as fast, from which nanoparticles nucleated by gas phase condensation process, which deposited everywhere inside the water-cooled vacuum chamber. Controlled plasma material interaction ensured the synthesis of nanoparticles with small average size and without mixed with aggregated lump of particles. The massive argon plasma density had ensured that plasma beam at the remote location of interaction was populated with highly reactive atomic oxygen radicals, which was responsible for the enhanced plasma chemistry. As-synthesized, non-stoichiometric, tungsten-oxide nanoparticles in blue colour were annealed to produce fine crystalline tungsten-oxide in yellow colour, and without mixed with large aggregated particles. This annealed powder could photo-catalytically degrade harmful dyes mixed with water within just a few hours, under irradiation of an ordinary light source in the visible wavelength region. The same annealed powder demonstrated efficient antibacterial characteristics, against E. coli bacteria, which was ascribed to the ROS and perforating capability of the nanoparticle sample due to their superfine sizes. Considering its bulk rate of production by a two-step process, combined with the efficient multi-functionality for dye degradation and bactericidal properties, the annealed tungsten-oxide nanomaterial may be termed as a promising potential candidate material for large scale treatment of waste-water. The same sample demonstrated moderate HER activity."
