0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered to be a clean fuel and could have an important role in reducing harmful emissions in the future. Currently, hydrogen commercially used is mainly produced on a large scale by steam reforming of natural gas [1,2]. However, the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels will increase the emission amounts of carbon dioxide and local pollution. Alternatively, production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, opens a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources [3–5]. Steam reforming of pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) is one of the promising routes for hydrogen production from biomass [6–9]. Bio-oil, generated from biomass via a fast pyrolysis process [10], generally contains numerous and complex oxygenated organic compounds including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, substituted phenolics and other oxygenates derived from biomass carbohydrates and lignin [11,12]. Among them, acetic acid (HAc) is one of the major components in bio-oil (up to 12%) [11]. In addition, since HAc is non-flammable, it is a safer hydrogen carrier than many other model compounds of bio-oil, such as methanol and ethanol. Therefore, the study of HAc reforming provides valuable route for the production of hydrogen from bio-oil. The intent of the HAc steam reforming process is to make as much hydrogen as possible by the reforming reactions of HAc in the presence of steam over a catalyst. Stoichiometrically, steam reforming of HAc can be represented as follows: (1) CH3COOH+2H2O→2CO2 +4H2 (ΔH 298K =134.77kJ/mol). However, it has been revealed that the reaction pathways that occurred in the HAc reforming process were very complex and a lot of potential products may form, depending on the catalysts used and the reforming conditions. Various metals or metallic oxides catalysts, e.g., Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ni, Fe, and Co, which were supported on metal oxide carriers such as Al2O3, La2O3/Al2O3, MgO/Al2O3, CeO2/Al2O3, etc., have been used for the steam reforming of HAc [13–25]. It was found that Ni-based and Fe–Co catalysts present high activity and selectivity toward hydrogen production [14,19,25]. High energy efficiency in the production process of hydrogen is essential from the viewpoint of economy. In the present work, an electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) approach with relatively high energy efficiency was developed, in which an electrified Ni–Cr wire was used for heating the catalyst and synchronously providing the thermal electrons onto the catalyst during the HAc reforming. The ECR proposal rooted in the study of the anionic emission materials in our previous work [26–32]. We developed an approach to selectively store and emit the anions O− [26,27], OH− [28,29], H− [30,31] and F− [32] via the Ca–Al–O materials (C12A7-X−, X=O, OH, H, F, etc.). When a current was applied on these materials, the electrons provided by the negative power source were supplied onto the material surface and it entered into the materials' body. The electrons can provide a substitute for the lost anions due to the emission and keep the charge neutrality in the material [30]. To obtain a stable anionic beam, the consumed anions (X−) can be regenerated via an implantation method by the reaction of molecules with thermal electrons (e.g., O2 (surface)+2e−(surface)→2O− (surface) [26,27]). In fact, it is well known that when an electrified metal or metal oxide is heated, electrons can be thermally emitted from the surface [33]. And electrons on a metal or a metal oxide surface play an important role in the reduction process (e.g., O2 +4e− →2O2−), occurring on the cathode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) [34]. The main aim of this work is to promote the decomposition and reforming of HAc via the current applied to the catalyst, which may be useful for increasing the energy efficiency in the production process of hydrogen. The influences of the current on the HAc decomposition, reforming, and reduction of NiO in the ECR process have been investigated in detail, which were compared with those in the common steam reforming route (CSR, i.e., outside heating mode). Possible explanation for the effect of current was also provided."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Nickel catalyst supported on Al2O3 was prepared by the impregnation method using nickel nitrate as the metal precursor. A known amount of Ni(NO3)2 was dissolved in water, and Al2O3 was added to the solution under continuous stirring. The slurry was dried at 110°C for 24h and then calcined in air at 500°C for 5h for complete decomposition of nickel nitrate. The nickel loading in the resulting sample was about 18wt.% NiO, which was measured by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP/AES, ASATJA Co., USA). Finally, the catalyst was crushed into granules (180–250μm) and used for the reforming of HAc. The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area of the catalyst was determined to be ∼115.1m2/g by the N2 physisorption via a COULTER SA 3100 analyzer. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB-250, Thermo-VG Scientific, USA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'pert Pro Philips diffractometer) were also performed to investigate the properties of the catalyst and its alteration after the HAc reforming [9]. The Ni–Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by the preparation of NiO–Al2O3 at first, and then followed by a complete reduction of NiO–Al2O3 into Ni–Al2O3 at 550°C for 6h in the flowing H2 (f =30ml/min), being guaranteed by the XRD, XPS and ICP/AES analyses. The nickel loading in the resulting sample was about 17.8wt.% Ni. The BET surface area of the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst was determined to be ∼102.1m2/g. The particle size of the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst was the same as NiO–Al2O3."
3,Reaction system and operating procedure,"2.2 Reaction system and operating procedure As shown in Fig. 1 , the reforming experiments for HAc were carried out in the continuous flow systems using a quartz fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. HAc was quantitatively fed into the reactor using the micro-injection pumps (Longer, TS2-60). On the other hand, the steam from the steam-generator was simultaneously fed into the reactors for adjusting the S/C (steam/carbon) ratio. The HAc reforming experiments were performed and compared with two following modes, i.e., the common steam reforming (CSR) mode and the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) mode. In the case of the ECR mode (Fig. 1(a)), an annular Ni–Cr wire, used for heating the 18%NiO/Al2O3 catalyst and providing the thermal electrons onto the catalyst, was installed in the reactor. The diameter of the Ni–Cr wire was ø0.81mm, the total length of the Ni–Cr wire installed in the reactor was about 2.95m when it was un-drawn as a straight line, and the resistance was about 16.0Ω. The catalyst was uniformly embedded around the Ni–Cr wire, which passed through a given ac electronic current. To make a certain reforming temperature, the catalyst was also heated by an outside furnace as compensation. When the effects of the current were tested under low temperature (i.e., low averaged temperature in the bed, <350°C) and high inner current (>3.0A), the outside cooling by the circle water was performed to meet the above experimental conditions. For the CSR mode (Fig. 1(b)), both the Ni–Cr wire and the catalyst powder were installed in the middle zone of the reactor. The power source applied to the Ni–Cr wire was shut off. The catalyst bed was heated homogeneously by an outside furnace. Temperature distributions in the catalyst bed under different conditions were first measured by a series of thermocouples inserted into different position in the bed. The coordinates (position (x, y)) in the ECR catalyst bed and in the CSR catalyst bed are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The coordinate (0, 0) stands for the center of the bed. As shown in Table 1 , the flow speed of the mixture gas (f total) and the heating modes (i.e., ECR and CSR) mainly affected the temperature distribution in the catalyst bed. When the temperature in the center of the ECR catalyst bed was near 550°C, the maximal temperature gradients in the transverse orientation and in the longitudinal orientation for low flow speed condition (total flow: 30ml/min) were about 13°C and 24°C, respectively. With increasing the flow speed, maximal temperature gradients both in the transverse and longitudinal orientation increased, reaching about 17°C and 32°C, respectively, for total flow speed of 300ml/min. On the other hand, the temperature gradients for the CSR mode are a little smaller than those in the ECR mode. In practice, the temperature distribution in the catalyst bed was tested before running the reforming experiments. The relationship between the averaged temperature (T average) and the center temperature (T (0,0)) in the catalyst bed was obtained from the temperature distribution that was measured under different experimental conditions. Thus, the averaged temperature needed can be adjusted by the center temperature through the power applied to the Ni–Cr wire and/or the outside oven. Moreover, the temperature in the center of the catalyst bed, generally, is close to the average temperature (the deviations between the center temperature and the average value in the bed were less than 10°C) in our investigated range (300–600°C). Here, the averaged temperature in the catalyst bed was approximately used as the reaction temperature in the ECR or CSR experiments. To further study the effect of the local temperature, the temperature data on the Ni–Cr wire (T surface) under various conditions were supplied, which were detected by the thermocouples attached to the Ni–Cr wire. As shown in Table 2 , the local temperature on the Ni–Cr wire was obviously higher than the averaged temperature or that in the center of catalyst bed. In particular, the temperature difference between the averaged temperature and on the Ni–Cr wire was 60–100°C, as the inner current was higher (I inside >3.0A). The products from the HAc reforming were analyzed by two on-line gas chromatographs (GC1: SP6890, Molecular Sieve 5 A and GC2: SP6890, GDX-502) with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The carbon conversion denoted as C, the hydrogen yield denoted as Y H2, and the products selectivity (CO, CO2, CH4, etc.) denoted as S P are calculated according to Eqs. (2)–(4): (2) C = { [ moles HAc ] in − [ moles HAc ] out } × 100 % / [ moles HAc ] in , (3) Y H2 = [ moles H 2 ] × 100 % / 4 [ moles HAc ] in , (4) S P = [ moles P ] × 100 % / x { [ moles HAc ] in − [ moles HAc ] out } , where P stands for products and x is the stoichiometry factor. All of the data presented were given as the average value. Generally, the experiments were repeated for three times. The difference for each repeating, in general, ranged from 0 to 10%. The intermediate species desorbed from the catalyst surface were mass analyzed by a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer at a background vacuum of about 1×10−4 Pa. The experimental setup of the TOF system has been described in detail elsewhere [26]. Here, a quartz-tube reactor was installed in the center of the sample chamber of the TOF system. The reactants and carrier gas (argon) were fed onto the quartz-tube reactor by a nozzle with a total pressure of about 10−1 Pa in the reactor tube. A small amount of the products (including intermediates formed in the decomposition reactions) passed through a pinhole of about 100μm located in the center of the quartz-tube reactor, which allows a simultaneous analysis via the TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 7(a))."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Effect of current on reforming of HAc,"3.1 Effect of current on reforming of HAc Generally, the reforming reactions can be evaluated in the following aspects: the carbon conversion, the hydrogen yield, and the products selectivity. As a novel process, the ECR was studied comparing with the CSR (i.e., I =0A), and the effect of the current was valued in the aspects mentioned above. Fig. 2(a) presents the influence of current on the carbon conversion over 18%NiO/Al2O3, which was measured as a function of current through the catalyst at different fixed temperatures. The carbon conversion remarkably increased with increasing the current. For CSR (i.e., I =0A), the carbon conversion was very low (about 3.5%) at 300°C. With increasing the current to 4.0A, however, the carbon conversion for the ECR process significantly increased to about 83.1% at the same temperature. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the hydrogen yield was also enhanced by the current through the catalyst, particularly at relatively low temperature (300–400°C). With increasing the current from 0 to 4.0A, the yield of hydrogen increased from 1.9% to 82.1% at 300°C. At 400°C, the hydrogen yield was 36.2% for CSR (I =0A), while it reached 89.9% for I =4.0A via ECR. Fig. 2(c) shows the effect of the current on the selectivity of the products from the HAc reforming over 18%NiO/Al2O3. Besides H2 (55.7–62.1vol%), the main by-products observed are CO2 (25.8–29.9vol%) and CO (2.1–5.0vol%) together with a trace amount of CH4 (0–1.6vol%). The selectivity of H2 and CO slightly increased with increasing the current, accompanied by the decrease in the CO2 and CH4 selectivity. In particular, the selectivity of H2 is close to 100%, and that of the un-reformed by-product of CH4 is near zero at higher current over 3.0A. Previously, it has been revealed that the HAc reforming in CSR over the Ni-based catalyst usually should operate at higher temperature [16]. For example, temperature over 600°C is required to ensure relatively high carbon conversion (over 80%) by CSR over the NiO–Al2O3 catalyst [14]. Present results indicate that the hydrogen production with relatively high yield from HAc reforming, even at 300–400°C over usual Ni-based reforming catalyst, is feasible by the ECR approach. Fig. 3 shows the differences in the initial reforming performances between the NiO–Al2O3 and Ni–Al2O3 catalysts, which were measured as a function of temperature under four conditions, i.e., (a) CSR (I =0A) over the NiO–Al2O3 catalyst, (b) CSR (I =0A) over the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst, (c) ECR (I =3.0A) over the NiO–Al2O3 catalyst, and (d) ECR (I =3.0A) over the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. It was found that both the NiO–Al2O3 and Ni–Al2O3 catalysts have the catalytic activity for the HAc reforming. And the reforming activity over the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst is somewhat higher than that over the NiO–Al2O3 catalyst in our investigated region. For example, in the case of I =0A (i.e., CSR), the carbon conversion over NiO–Al2O3 was about 67.9% at 500°C, while about 77.0% over Ni–Al2O3 at the same temperature. Furthermore, the influence of the current on the carbon conversion as well as the hydrogen yield was also observed for the Ni–Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 3(b) and (d)). The influences of the Ni–Cr wire on the HAc reforming were also investigated. Fig. 4 presents the results from the following tests, including (1) the empty bed test (i.e., neither Ni–Cr wire nor catalyst), (2) only the Ni–Cr wire (I =0A) installed in the reactor, (3) only the electrified Ni–Cr wire (I =3.0A) installed in the reactor, (4) the CSR mode (I =0A) over 18%NiO/Al2O3 catalyst, and (5) the ECR mode (I =3.0A) over 18%NiO/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. The conversion of carbon and the hydrogen yield over the single Ni–Cr wire are much lower than that from the reforming via the catalyst, and similar to that of the empty bed test. Moreover, the experiments were carried out in the reactor installed with the Ni–Cr both for the ECR and CSR. It indicates that the contribution from the Ni–Cr wire can be ignored. Fig. 5 shows the stability of the catalyst during ECR. The carbon conversion gradually decreases from 96.1% to 88.2%, and the hydrogen yield slightly decreases from 93.2% to 80.9% after 20h of reforming. The above results indicate that no serious deactivation of the catalyst occurred in our investigated ranges. Generally, the catalyst deactivation can be ascribed to the deposition of carbon (coke-formation) on the catalyst [35]. In our case, the deposition amount of the carbon on the surface of the catalyst estimated from the XPS measurements was about 2.7%, indicating that no serious deposition of carbon occurred in ECR under the investigated condition. The energy efficiency and cost were estimated for the production of hydrogen from the ECR and CSR modes. Energy efficiency was defined as the heating value of hydrogen (about 142MJ/kg) divided by the energy consumed by the reforming system per kilogram of hydrogen produced. The consumed energy for ECR included the power of the inner and outside heaters as well as that of the steam used. The consumed energy for CSR included the power of the outside heater and that of the steam. The amount of hydrogen formed from the reforming per hour was derived from the dry gas volume collected and the content of hydrogen in the mixtures. As shown in Table 3 , in our investigated range, the energy efficiency estimated from the ECR mode ranged from 79% to 85%, the corresponding cost ranged from 50 (kWh/kgH2) to 47 (kWh/kgH2). The energy efficiency estimated from the CSR mode ranged from 52% to 60% and the corresponding cost ranged from 77 (kWh/kgH2) to 66 (kWh/kgH2). As can be seen, the energy efficiency in the ECR reforming process was higher than that in the CSR process. This may be attributed to the electrified Ni–Cr wire installed in the reactor, playing a dual role both in heating the catalyst and in providing the thermal electrons onto the catalyst. The thermal electrons may promote the dissociation and the reforming reactions of HAc as discussed below."
6,Effect of current on decomposition of HAc,"3.2 Effect of current on decomposition of HAc The decomposition of HAc was investigated via the homogeneous tests under different current over the quartz bed (the quartz powder embedded around the Ni–Cr wire). As shown in Fig. 6(a), the carbon conversion for the decomposition of HAc depends on both the temperature and the current. Without the current supplied (i.e., I =0A) over the quartz bed, the carbon conversion was very low (about 1%) at 500°C. However, the carbon conversion increased to 10.8% for I =4.0A at this temperature. Fig. 6(b) presents the effect of the current on the selectivity of the products from the decomposition of HAc. The main products from the decomposition of HAc observed are H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. It was found that the selectivity of H2 and CO slightly increased with increasing the current, accompanied by the decrease in the selectivity of CO2 and CH4. The synchronous presence of H2 and CO may indicate that H2, in probability, is produced via the following decomposition reaction: (5) CH3COOH→2CO+2H2. Carbon dioxide and methane are the other two dominant products which seem to follow identical trends, implying that they may be produced according to the decomposition reaction: (6) CH3COOH→CO2 +CH4. The above results indicate that the current promotes the decomposition of HAc. To further study the dissociation processes of HAc, the species desorbed from the catalyst surface were detected by an anionic time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry under the low-pressure (10−1 Pa) condition. Without the current applied, no signal was observed. When the current passed through the catalyst in argon (Fig. 7(b)), only one peak near the mass numbers of zero was observed, corresponding to the thermal electrons desorbed from the electrified Ni–Cr wire and the catalyst surface. When water/argon was fed onto the electrified catalyst, three new peaks appeared, corresponding to H− (m/z =1), OH− (m/z =17), and H2O− (m/z =18), respectively (Fig. 7(c)). These anionic fragments would form by the dissociation of water with the thermal electrons on the catalyst surface (e.g., e−(s)+H2O(s)→OH−(s)+H(s), where s represents the surface). When HAc and argon were fed onto the electrified catalyst, a series of new peaks appeared, corresponding to H−(1), H2 −(2), CH x −(x =0–4, m/z =12–16), OH−(17), CO−(28), and CO2 −(44), respectively (Fig. 7(d)). The anionic hydrocarbon fragments may form via the dissociation of HAc caused by the thermal electrons on the catalyst surface (i.e., e−(s)+CH3COOH(s)→CH x −(s)+⋯, see Section 3.4)."
7,Influence of current on reduction of catalyst,"3.3 Influence of current on reduction of catalyst The NiO reduction into the metallic Ni during ECR and CSR was investigated by the XPS and XRD measurements. Fig. 8 shows the typical XPS spectra and XRD spectra from (a) fresh 18%NiO/Al2O3 catalyst, (b) the used catalyst after CSR for 5h, (c) the used catalyst after CSR for 10h, (d) the used catalyst after ECR for 5h, (e) the used catalyst after ECR for 10h, and (f) the treated 18%NiO/Al2O3 catalyst via a current passing through the catalyst in argon for 5h, respectively. In the XPS spectrum, the binding energies of about 855.8eV and 862.0eV were observed for the pristine catalyst, which were assigned to the main line of Ni2+(2p3/2) and its satellite [19,36], respectively. The XPS spectrum after CSR was similar to that of the fresh one, but an identifiable shoulder near 852.3eV was observed, corresponding to the peak of the metallic Ni0(2p3/2) [19,36]. This means that Ni is nearly in +2 “formal” oxidation states in the freshly prepared catalyst. After CSR, part of Ni2+ on the catalyst surface (about 19.5%) was reduced to metallic Ni0. After ECR for 5h, the peak of Ni0(2p3/2) appeared significantly stronger and most of Ni2+ (about 68.0%) on the catalyst surface was reduced to Ni0. With the increase in the reforming time, the reduction of NiO into Ni increased. The typical XRD spectra of the four samples mentioned above are also shown in Fig. 8. For the fresh catalyst, the NiO phase (37.5°, 43.3° and 62.9°) was observed. For the used catalyst after CSR, new peaks appeared at 2θ =44.7°, 52.1° and 76.6°, corresponding to the diffraction structure of the Ni(111), Ni(200), Ni(220) phases, respectively [37]. As for the catalyst after ECR, the XRD pattern is quite different from that of the fresh one. The relative intensity of the Ni diffraction peaks became remarkably strong, accompanied with the decrease in the NiO phase. This means that an additional amount of NiO was reduced into the metallic Ni during the ECR process, which agreed with the XPS results. The reduction of Ni2+ into Ni0 during the CSR process can be explained by the following reaction: (7) NiO+H2 →Ni0 +H2O, where H2 was produced by the reforming of HAc in CSR. The additional reduction of Ni2+ for ECR would be attributed to the reaction of the ionic state Ni2+ with the thermal electrons through the reaction, i.e., (8) Ni2+ +2e− →Ni0. This explanation was supported by two facts: (1) the desorption of the thermal electrons from the electrified catalyst was directly observed by the TOF measurements (Fig. 7) and (2) the reduction from the oxidation state to the metallic phase was also observed when a current passed through the catalyst in argon (i.e., without reducing reagents such as H2, Fig. 8(d)). Electrons on a metal or a metal oxide surface play a role of reduction, which also appeared on the cathode of a solid oxide fuel cell (e.g., O2 +4e− →2O2−) [34]."
8,Possible explanation for the effects of current,"3.4 Possible explanation for the effects of current The results reported in the present work have shown that the current applied to the catalyst significantly promotes the HAc decomposition, reforming, and the reduction of NiO in the catalyst, which will be discussed as follows. First, since ECR (i.e., inner heating) and CSR (i.e., outside heating) have different heating modes, inevitably causing different temperature distribution in the catalyst bed, the different temperature gradient was evaluated for the promotional effect of ECR process. The experimental results show that the temperature in the center of the catalyst bed was approximately close to the average temperature and the maximal temperature gradients in ECR were a little higher than those in CSR (Table 1). In particular, the local temperature on the Ni–Cr wire was obviously higher than the averaged temperature or that in the center of catalyst bed (Table 2). The local temperature near the electrified Ni–Cr wire, also, was higher than the averaged temperature. Accordingly, the activity of the catalyst reforming near the electrified Ni–Cr wire should be significantly higher than other positions in the bed, partly, leading to the enhancement of the overlap reforming effect. Second, the effects of current may partly arise from the enhancement of the decomposition and reforming by thermal electrons in ECR, which were confirmed by the TOF results. It is well known that when an electrified metal or a metal oxide is heated, electrons can boil off its surface, leading to thermal emission of electrons from surface (i.e., thermal electron emission) [33]. It has been reported that thermal electrons on a metal or a metal oxide surface play an important role in the reduction process (e.g., O2 +4e− →2O2−) [34], and in the molecular decomposition or ionization processes [32]. The promoting effect of the current on the HAc decomposition, its reforming, and the catalyst reduction is supported by the following observation: (1) the presence of the thermal electrons both on the electrified Ni–Cr wire and on the electrified catalyst surface was directly demonstrated by the anionic TOF measurements (Fig. 7(b)); (2) the HAc dissociation into the anionic hydrocarbon fragments (CH x −) and the dissociation of water into OH− by the thermal electrons on the electrified catalyst surface were also observed (Fig. 7(c) and (d)); (3) a part or complete reduction from the oxidation state to the metallic phase in the NiO/Al2O3 catalyst was observed when a current passed through the catalyst in argon, which is being attributed to the reaction of Ni2+ with the thermal electrons (i.e., Ni2+ +2e− →Ni0) (Fig. 8(d)). Accordingly, the thermal electrons may play an important role in promoting the HAc decomposition, its reforming and the catalyst reduction, partly leading to the increase in the carbon conversion and the hydrogen yield in the ECR process. Moreover, the promotion on HAc decomposition and its reforming may be due to the additional reduction of NiO into the metallic Ni during the ECR process. Based on the comparison between NiO and Ni, the reforming activity over the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst is somewhat higher than that over the NiO–Al2O3 catalyst in our investigated region. However, the prominent influence of the current on the HAc reforming was also observed for the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst, and the carbon conversion as well as the hydrogen yield was far lower in the case of CSR over the Ni–Al2O3 catalyst than that in the case of ECR over the NiO–Al2O3 catalyst at the same temperature (Fig. 3). This means that the promoting effects of the current on the production of hydrogen from HAc observed in the ECR process via the NiO–Al2O3 catalyst could not be completely attributed to the reduction of NiO into Ni. On the other hand, it should also be pointed out that the contribution of the Ni–Cr wire to the HAc reforming has been eliminated. The conversion of carbon and the hydrogen yield over the single Ni–Cr wire are similar to that of the empty bed test. All experiments were carried out in the reactor installed with the Ni–Cr wire when comparing the performance between ECR and CSR. Thus, the effects of the current on the HAc reforming in the ECR process cannot be explained by the additional activity due to the presence of Ni–Cr wire. It was found that the energy efficiency in the ECR reforming process was higher than that in the CSR process (Table 3), which may be explained by the multiple roles including local temperature effect, the effect of thermal electrons, and less heat loss in the inner heating mode. Further work is still required to clearly understand the reforming mechanism in ECR process."
9,Conclusions,"This work presents a new method for hydrogen production via the electrochemical catalytic reforming of HAc over the 18%NiO/Al2O3 catalyst with higher energy efficiency, giving well reforming performance including high hydrogen yield and high carbon conversion even at relatively low temperature of 300–400°C. It was observed that the current applied to the catalyst significantly promotes the HAc decomposition, reforming and the reduction of NiO in the catalyst. The thermal electrons may play an important role in the promoting effect, leading to the increase in the carbon conversion and the hydrogen yield in the ECR process."
