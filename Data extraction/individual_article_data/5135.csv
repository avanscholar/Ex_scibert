0,Introduction,"The manufacturing of particulates assisted by porous membranes offers unique perspectives in terms of uniform size distribution achieved at low shear stress and high productivity, as well as with easy scale-up [1–5]. In general, membrane processes have shown high performance in the manufacturing of micron scale particles, while their use in the production of sub-micron and nanosized particles is less developed. On the other hand, nanosized particles with high uniform size distribution are required in many applications, including medicine and pharmaceuticals. In particular, hydrogel nanosized particles (H-NPs) have attracted much attention because they combine the properties of hydrogels (such as hydrophilicity, high capacity of water absorption, biocompatibility, deformation under pressure, and the ability to penetrate pores smaller than the nominal particle diameter) with those of NPs (such as long blood circulation time and targeted delivery). In biomedicine, the delivery of water-soluble macromolecules, such as peptides/proteins and nucleic acids, is gaining interest as many of them show potential anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activity [6]. H-NPs are also attractive candidates for the development of biosensing materials for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of various diseases [7]. However, despite the above advantages, the use of H-NPs in biomedicine has not been fully explored at present [6,8]. On the other hand, the unique properties of polymeric hydrogels could potentially be used as essential tools for applications not only in the biomedical field but also in agricultural, industrial, and environmental fields [9]. A major limitation of existing delivery systems and the development of innovative delivery systems based on H-NPs is the lack of scalable techniques for large-scale production of H-NPs. Currently, the methods for preparing NPs formulations are mainly based on nanoemulsion templates [10]. The formation of emulsions is usually achieved by high energy input generated by the use of sonicators or homogenizers in the presence of a large amount of emulsifiers. Nanoprecipitation is an alternative and low energy technology for the manufacturing of NPs, which was introduced in the late 1980s by Fessi et al. [11]. Since its introduction, the technique has been widely used for the fabrication of drug-loaded nanocapsules or nanospheres. Nanoprecipitation requires two miscible phases (i.e., a polar organic solvent and water). Upon contact, the organic solvent, in which the polymer is usually dissolved, diffuses into the aqueous phase (dispersing medium) and causes precipitation of the polymer in the form of NPs [12]. The driving force of nanoprecipitation (including the three phases of nucleation, growth and aggregation) is supersaturation, which is achieved when the polymer concentration in the solvent mixture exceeds its corresponding solubility [13]. Although the method itself is quite versatile, it has been used mainly for amphiphilic block copolymers (e.g. poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)) [14,15] and hydrophobic polymers (e.g. polycaprolactone (PCL)) [13,16], while a limited number of publications have focused on the production of H-NPs. In particular, the formulation of starch [17], chitosan [18] and gelatin [19] has been explored. In the last two decades, natural hydrogels have been gradually replaced by hydrogels based on synthetic biopolymers, which have a significant capacity of water absorption and a long lifetime and high gel strength [9]. Among them, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is widely used in biomedical applications [20,21]. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one work in the literature that reports the preparation of PVA-H-NPs by nanoprecipitation in a batch process [22] (Table 1 ). Moreover, no work has been reported that focuses on the design of scalable production of PVA-H-NPs by nanoprecipitation. Direct membrane emulsification is recognised as a continuous, scalable, and well-established dispersion method for the preparation of emulsions and solidified particles [26–31]. However, its application in the production of nanoscale particulate has limitations. This is because, unlike nanoprecipitation (which uses miscible phases), direct membrane emulsification requires an immiscible dispersing phase to migrate through non-wetted nanosized pores to form nanodroplets in contact with the immiscible continuous phase. In general, a linear coefficient between pore size and droplet size was observed, ranging from 2 to 10 [27]. Therefore, the high interfacial tension and small pore size required to obtain nanodroplets limit the process performance. Although strategies to achieve suitable disperse phase flux at low transmembrane pressure by using membranes with asymmetric wettability have been reported [32,33], the control of droplet size at submicron and nanoscale remains a challenge. High throughput membrane micromixing systems were combined with the non-solvent induced phase separation to promote nanoprecipitation as a reproducible, productive, low-energy, and continuous process for the preparation of polymeric NPs [34–36], BSA NPs [37], liposomes [38,39], drug-nanocrystals [40,41], and inorganic NPs [42]. While the high efficiency of membranes as micromixing devices has been demonstrated for the production of microcrystals by antisolvent crystallization in porous hollow fiber membranes [43,44], few studies are available for the production of nanosized particles and the key parameters governing NPs formation assisted by the membrane process have not been fully investigated. In the present work, a scalable method based on the use of membrane nanoprecipitation for the continuous production of PVA-H-NPs has been demonstrated. It is worth noting that, in previous works summarized in Table 1, H-NPs (other than PVA) were produced only by conventional batch nanoprecipitation in bulk solutions. To the best of our knowledge, no other nanoprecipitation method considered suitable for large-scale production of NPs (including mixing devices such as confined impinging jets (CIJ), mixer and multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) and microfluidic hydrodynamic flow focusing (HFF) devices [45]) has been tested for PVA-H-NPs formulation. Therefore, due to the lack of information on the role of the main factors affecting the size distribution of PVA-H-NPs produced by nanoprecipitation, a propaedeutic systematic characterization of the polymer/solvent/non-solvent system was carried out. This knowledge was used as a rational guide for the subsequent study of the influence of polymer concentration, solvent type, non-solvent type, and solvent/non-solvent volumetric ratio on the process performance. The study permitted to identify the conditions for tuning PVA-H-NPs size and size distribution. Membrane nanoprecipitation was then promoted by porous membranes operated in two configurations: i) a batch membrane process (using a flat-sheet membrane in a stirred cell) to evaluate the influence of the membrane in the production of PVA-H-NPs with respect to the other chemical and fluid dynamic parameters, and ii) a continuous single-pass membrane process (based on a cross-flow operation mode using a tubular membrane) to demonstrate process scalability."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) 10–98, MW ~61,000, degree of polymerization ~ 1400 was purchased from Fluka Analytical (Italy, Milan). Pluronic F127 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Italy, Milan). Ethanol and acetone were purchased from VWR International (Italy, Milan)."
3,Nanoparticles characterization,"2.2 Nanoparticles characterization PVA-H-NPs size and size distribution were measured by Dynamic Light-Scattering (DLS) (ZetaSize NanoZS, Malvern Instrument) and the results were reported in terms of Z-average diameter (Z-Average) and polydispersity index (PDI) [35]. A Jeol JEM 1400 Plus Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) at 100 kV was used to study the morphology of PVA-H-NPs and for cross-checking the size range of the nanoparticles."
4,Membrane nanoprecipitation protocol,"2.3 Membrane nanoprecipitation protocol The physicochemical properties of the phases suitable for promoting nanoprecipitation were first screened in a batch process. After identifying the “ouzo zone” in the three-phase diagram and setting the parameters in the appropriate range, the nanoprecipitation was carried out in continuous flow through the membrane system and the influence of fluid dynamic conditions was investigated. The performance of the process was evaluated in terms of nanoparticle size and size distribution. The reproducibility of the results was checked by three replicate experiments for the batch and continuous modes and the error bars in the figures represent the range of results from the different tests. 2.3.1 Preparation of PVA H-NPs by batch nanoprecipitation PVA-H-NPs were prepared by batch nanoprecipitation at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). PVA was dissolved in deionized water (90 °C) or in water/ethanol mixture (50/50, 90 °C). The resulting polymer solutions were then added dropwise to magnetically stirred (250 rpm) water-miscible organic solvent (ethanol or acetone) containing Pluronic F127. The resulting colloidal dispersions were characterized as described in section 2.2. 2.3.2 Construction of the “ouzo diagram” The ouzo diagram defines the metastable region (ouzo zone) where supersaturation conditions allow the formation of stable nanosized suspensions [45]. The identification of this region, located between the binodal and spinodal boundaries of the three-phase diagram, enabled the rational design of nanoparticles, avoiding blind trial-and-error approach. For easy of comparison with data available in the literature for hydrophobic polymers, the “ouzo diagram” for hydrophilic polymers (PVA/solvent/non-solvent) was constructed using the same strategy described for polymers soluble in organic solvents [46,47]. A fixed amount of an aqueous polymer (PVA) solution was added dropwise to a dispersion medium represented by a polar organic solvent (e.g., ethanol or acetone) that was miscible with water (the solvent in which the polymer was dissolved) but acted as a non-solvent for the polymer. The polymer solution was added to provide a desired mass fraction of the polymer with respect to the relative amount of solvent and non-solvent in the ternary system. In constructing the ouzo diagram, the mass fraction of PVA (fPVA) and solvent (fS) was plotted on the abscissa and ordinate, respectively. The fraction of the organic non-solvent (fNS) was determined by difference (fNS = 1 − fPVA − fS). Each formulation was analysed by DLS. The size distribution of nanoparticles was evaluated by polydispersity index (PDI). The stable and unstable “ouzo regions” were identified by uniform (PDI < 0.2) and broad (PDI ≥ 0.2) nanoparticle size distribution, respectively. The solution of pluronic F127 dissolved in the organic non-solvent phase was also analysed as a blank reference. The solvent-non-solvent interaction (X S-NS ) and the solvent-polymer interaction (XS-P ) parameters were calculated as previously reported [48–50] according to the following equations: (1) X S − N S = V N S R T ( δ S − δ N S ) 2 (2) X S − P = V S R T ( δ S − δ P ) 2 where VNS is the molar volume of the non-solvent, VS is the molar volume of the solvent, δS, δNS and δP are the solubility parameters of solvent, non-solvent and polymer, respectively, R is the gas constant. The solubility parameters of materials used in the present work were summarized in Table 2 . 2.3.3 Preparation of PVA-H-NPs by membrane nanoprecipitation in batch mode A stirred cell (purchased from Micropore Technologies Ltd, Redcar, UK) was used to carry out the membrane nanoprecipitation in batch mode. The cell was equipped with a ringed flat, disc-shaped hydrophilic metallic membrane with pore size of 5 μm and effective area of 2.76 cm2 (Fig. 1 ). The cell was filled with 30 mL of organic phase (ethanol or acetone, both containing pluronic F127, 2 wt%) and the stirring speed was modified in the range of 330–1100 rpm to achieve a shear stress at the membrane surface between 0.7 and 14 Pa. An Ismatec® Variable-Speed Analog pump was used to inject the aqueous polymer solution (0.5 wt% PVA in deionized water) through the membrane with a flow rate in the range from 0.8 to 6.6 mL min−1 (corresponding to a transmembrane flux from 180 to 1440 L m−2 h−1). The experiments were run until a certain solvent/non-solvent (S/NS) volumetric ratio was reached. The metallic membrane was washed with distilled water in an ultrasonic bath, 2–3 times, after each experiment, for 5 min. 2.3.4 The continuous production of PVA-H-NPs by membrane nanoprecipitation The continuous production of PVA-H-NPs was carried out in a membrane nanoprecipitation plant developed in our laboratory. Tubular hydrophilic Shirasu porous glass (SPG, Miyazaki, Japan) membranes with pore size of 5 and 0.6 μm and effective area of 31.3 cm2 were used. The equipment included two peristaltic pumps (Masterflex® L/S® Variable Speed Analog Console Pump Systems, ColeParmer). The first pump was used to feed the aqueous polymer solution (0.5 wt% PVA in deionized water) through the membrane. The second pump injected the organic phase (acetone containing Pluronic F127, 2 wt%) along the lumen of the membrane. The aqueous polymer solution and the organic phase were placed in glass bottles of 1 L and fed to the shell and the lumen side of the membrane, respectively. The flow rates of the two phases were set so that to let both phases pass simultaneously through the membrane module and to achieve a fixed S/NS volumetric ratio. The flow rate of the aqueous polymer solution was set at 7 mL min−1 (134 L h−1 m−2) while the flow rate of the organic phase was varied in a range from 14 to 120 mL min−1. As a result, the effect of S/NS volumetric ratio was studied in the range from 0.06 to 0.5. The continuous membrane nanoprecipitation process must be carried out while maintaining a constant flow rate of both the dispersing polymer solution through the membrane pores (from shell to lumen in our setup) and the non-solvent (along the lumen). This is because the size distribution of the NPs is controlled by the volumetric ratio of the two phases, and it is necessary to vary both simultaneously and appropriately to promote nanoprecipitation in a reproducible manner. Experiments were carried out for 45 min with the aim to demonstrate a continuous production of PVA NPs. This duration was close to that reported by Zhou et al. [41]. The formation of PVA-H-NPs occurred as soon as the aqueous polymer phase was brought in contact with the organic phase and the final formulation containing the NPs was collected in a separate glass bottle at the outlet of the membrane module. After each experiment, SPG membranes were washed 3 times with distilled water, in an ultrasonic bath, each time for 5 min. This simple procedure permitted to remove the polymer solution so that to prevent any precipitation of the polymer inside the membrane during storage. Full recovery of the original membrane properties was verified by measuring the membrane pure water permeance (128,000 ± 500 and 2400 ± 25 L m−2 h−1·bar−1 for 5 and 0.6 μm membrane pore size, respectively)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The ouzo diagram,"3.1 The ouzo diagram The ouzo diagram of PVA (polymer), water (solvent) and ethanol (non-solvent) was constructed by experimental measurements to identify the zone where it was possible to form highly monodisperse PVA-H-NPs. The basic data were not available in the literature. Fig. S1 illustrates the zone where the ouzo region is located in the ternary phase diagram. The experiments were carried out by adding the aqueous PVA solution into the ethanol to obtain certain mass fractions. The ouzu diagram of the PVA/water/ethanol ternary system was shown in Fig. 2 A, while the comparison between the size distributions of PVA-H-NPs synthesized in the “single phase”, “stable ouzo” and “unstable ouzo” regions was shown in Fig. 2B. The “ouzo zone” was identified by varying fPVA from 7.7 × 10−6 to 1.9 × 10−3 and fH2O from 2.5 × 10−4 to 1.2 × 10−1 with the change from transparent solutions to turbid nanosuspensions (Fig. S2 A and C) and a PDI smaller than 0.2 observed. The stable “ouzo zone” was indicated by the green solid circles (Fig. 2A and B) and stable and uniform PVA-H-NPs (PDI = 0.108) were formed within this narrow range. Increasing fPVA and fH2O resulted in an unstable zone (indicated by the empty square in Fig. 2A and B) where larger particles and aggregates formed (PDI = 0.259) and precipitated rapidly (Fig. S2 A and D). As fPVA decreased and fH2O increased a zone of complete miscibility (i.e., one phase region - indicated by the empty triangle in Fig. 2A and B) was observed, marking the limiting zone of miscibility of the polymer in the non-solvent, where the mixture appeared as a transparent phase (Fig. S2 A and B) and particle size analysis by DLS showed a peak at 5.0 nm (Fig. 2B). This peak was due to the pluronic® F127 present in ethanol, which was confirmed by the blank analysis (i.e., measurement of pure pluronic® F127 in ethanol). The PVA-H-NPs formed in the stable “ouzo zone” were also characterized by TEM, which confirmed their perfect spherical shape (Fig. 2C and D). The PVA-H-NPs number average diameter determined from DLS analysis (green solid circles in Fig. 2B) agreed very well with the images from TEM (Fig. 2C and D) confirming their very high uniform size distribution."
7,The influence of polymer concentration and solvent/non-solvent ratio,"3.2 The influence of polymer concentration and solvent/non-solvent ratio The influence of polymer concentration in the ouzo zone (from 0.125 to 1 wt %) on the size and size distribution of PVA-H-NPs was studied in detail (Fig. 3 A). Increasing the polymer concentration from 0.125 to 0.5 wt % caused only a small increase in the mean particle size (from 190 to 203 nm), while further increasing the polymer concentration from 0.5 to 1 wt % caused a significant increase in the PVA-H-NPs size to 243 nm. Since the polymer concentrations used were within the ouzo-stable zone, the particle size distribution was uniform (PDI = 0.15). Therefore, we can tune the mean particle size within the ouzo-stable region and obtain a very uniform size distribution. It should be emphasized that the range of mean particle size (190–240 nm) in which it is possible to tune particle size and PDI is very narrow, with a narrow range of polymer concentration (0.1–1 wt %, corresponding to a mass fraction of PVA from 3.05 × 10−5 to 2.42 × 10−4); these narrow conditions reflect the difficulties of obtaining uniform PVA-H-NPs without a systematic characterization. The increase in the mean particle size could be explained by the fact that at higher concentration the number of available polymer molecules increases leading to an increase in the number of nuclei and consequently the probability of nuclei encounters. The final dimension of the resulting NPs was determined by the aggregation of the adjacent polymer molecules [48,52]. The influence of the solvent/non-solvent ratio on PVA-H-NPs was also investigated using the same solvent (water) and non-solvent (ethanol). The initial PVA concentration in water was 0.5 wt %. The solvent/non-solvent ratio was varied from 0.01 to 0.07 v/v (corresponding to a variation of the solute fraction from 6.13 × 10−5 to 4.00 × 10−4) until the formation of non-uniform suspensions was achieved (PDI > 0.2). The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3B. The mean PVA-H-NPs size (nm) showed an exponential relationship with water/ethanol (v/v) ratio, while the size distribution was uniform (with a DPI < 0.15) up to a solvent/non-solvent ratio of 0.05. The increase of mean particle size can be explained by the fact that particle nuclei already present in the non-solvent (formed by the stepwise addition of PVA solution) preferentially adsorbed aqueous polymer solution, favouring the particle size increase instead of the formation of new particle nuclei. This can be confirmed by the higher affinity between PVA and water compared to the affinity between water and ethanol, as shown by the interaction parameters XP-S (0.0022) and XS-NS (0.0107) reported in Table S1."
8,The influence of polymer solvent and dispersing medium (non-solvent) on the PVA-H-NPs,"3.3 The influence of polymer solvent and dispersing medium (non-solvent) on the PVA-H-NPs The influence of the solvent used to solubilize the hydrophilic polymer on the properties of PVA-H-NPs has not been previously reported. In fact, most studies focused on NPs based on polymers soluble in organic solvents. Therefore, this behaviour was investigated by using water or a 50:50 mixture (v/v ratio) of water and ethanol as solvent, containing PVA 0.5 wt % (although PVA is not soluble in pure ethanol, it was soluble in the 50/50 water/ethanol mixture). Ethanol containing Pluronic F127 at 2 wt % was used as non-solvent dispersing medium (Table S1, lines 1 and 3). Another series of experiments was carried out by keeping the solvent (water) constant and changing the non-solvent (Table S1, lines 2–4). The overall results were presented in terms of average NPs size and PDI as a function of XS-NS parameter (Fig. 4 ). The results showed that the average size of NPs increased with XS-NS. The behaviour is congruent with the fact that a low ΧS-NS value implies higher affinity between solvent and non-solvent [47,48], which is responsible for faster mixing. For hydrophobic polymers and amphiphilic copolymers, it has already been shown that the mean particle size is mainly determined by the type of non-solvent chosen [47,49,53]. On the other hand, the use of water (polymer solvent) in the non-solvent mixture (as when ethanol/water mixture was used as non-solvent, XS-NS of 0.0030) led to the formation of suspended NPs mixed with polymer precipitate, which resulted in an increase in the average size distribution (PDI > 0.2). The diffusion of the solvent (water in our case) into the non-solvent is controlled by their affinity. However, the results demonstrated that when the mixing is very fast (as in the case of ethanol/water mixture as non-solvent) and the affinity between solvent and polymer is not very high (XS-P = 0.0022 in the case of water-PVA, see Table S1), aggregation phenomena between particles cannot be prevented. The presence of pluronic F127 was mandatory to prevent nanoprecipitation failure. Indeed, when PVA-N-NPs were produced without emulsifier, agglomeration occurred as soon as the PVA solution was added to ethanol (S/NS = 0.01 v/v). Pluronic F127 is a block copolymer of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO), which has an amphiphilic character that allows its adsorption on the surface of the newly formed polymer particles at the water/ethanol interface and hinders the coalescence process by steric repulsion. Previous studies have shown that there are some cases where nanoprecipitation was carried out without surfactant [47] and others where the surfactant affected the size of the NPs [12,17,51,54,55]. This indicates that the specific surfactant-polymer interaction still needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis. In the present study, the useful interaction for NPs stabilization should occur mainly through the hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and pluronic F127 [56]. The use of a higher surfactant concentration (4 wt % instead of 2 wt %) resulted in an increase in particle size at different solvent/non-solvent ratio (Table S2), suggesting that the (polymeric) surfactant molecules are involved in droplet formation."
9,PVA-H-NPs preparation by batch membrane nanoprecipitation,"3.4 PVA-H-NPs preparation by batch membrane nanoprecipitation One of the major challenges in the mass production of polymeric NPs by nanoprecipitation is the fine control of the mixing processes on a large batch scale [35]. The use of a porous membrane to feed the polymer solution into the non-solvent dispersion medium permitted to overcome this limitation. Two different modes of operation were used in the present work. Preliminary experiments were carried out by using the stirred cell unit (Fig. 1 A). This device permitted to use a relatively small volume of reagents through simple operations in evaluating the influence of different parameters on batch membrane nanoprecipitation [28,29]. Ethanol or acetone containing pluronic F127 2 wt % were used as non-solvents for the preparation of PVA-H-NPs by membrane nanoprecipitation, while PVA 0.5 wt % in water was used as polymer solution. The formulations were prepared at a flow rate through the membrane of 0.83 mL min−1 and a peak shear stress of 2.2 Pa in the receiving cell containing the non-solvent (30 mL). The formulation was stopped when the solvent/non-solvent ratio reached 0.06. The results illustrated in Fig. 5 were reported in terms of size and size distribution and compared with similar formulations obtained in a conventional batch stirring system. In agreement with the results achieved in the previous section, smaller particles were obtained by membrane nanoprecipitation when ethanol was used as non-solvent compared to acetone. Moreover, the PVA-H-NPs produced by membrane nanoprecipitation when ethanol was used as non-solvent were smaller and more uniform than the particles produced by conventional batch stirring system at the same solvent/non-solvent ratio. This effect was also observed when acetone was used, although less pronounced. As for the PDI, it was much lower when PVA-H-NPs were prepared by membrane nanoprecipitation (0.11) compared to those prepared by conventional nanoprecipitation (0.25) using ethanol as non-solvent. The opposite was observed when acetone was used as non-solvent (0.2 and 0.14, respectively for membrane and conventional nanoprecipitation). It is worth nothing that (at the same S/NS volume ratio of 0.06) with both non-solvents, membrane nanoprecipitation produced uniform NPs (PDI < 0.2), while conventional nanoprecipitation produced non uniform NPs (PDI > 0.2) when ethanol was used as non-solvent. The results suggest that the membrane plays a role in affecting the nanoprecipitation process, especially for solvent/non-solvent systems with high affinity (i.e., low XS-NS parameter). The fine dispersion of the polymer solution into the non-solvent through the membrane pores favoured the solvent/non-solvent mixing and consequently the formation and growth of the polymer nuclei. The effect of solvent/non-solvent volumetric ratio on particle size and size distribution prepared by membrane nanoprecipitation using ethanol or acetone is illustrated in Fig. 6 . While the formulation obtained using ethanol as non-solvent permitted to produce smaller PVA-H-NPs compared to those obtained using acetone, the particles average size for both non-solvents increased with the increase of the solvent/non-solvent ratio. The results agree with literature data reported for polymers soluble in organic solvents [35,36]. The influence of fluid dynamic parameters on membrane nanoprecipitation was also investigated. PVA-H-NPs Z-average and PDI as a function of polymer solution flux and shear stress at the membrane level were shown in Fig. 7 A and B, respectively. The results show that varying the flow rate of polymer solution (from 0.8 to 6.6 mL min−1, corresponding to a range of flux through the membrane from 180 to 1443 L h−1m−2, keeping the shear stress constant at 2.2 Pa) had no significant effect on the particle size and particle size distribution, as also observed in Ref. [35]. Also, when the shear stress was changed in the range of 1.6–9.6 Pa, no significant effect was observed in the Z-average value of PVA-H-NPs, while the PDI slightly increased in the same range. Data further confirmed that the role of the membrane in the nanoprecipitation process is to finely control the dispersion of the polymer solution and enhance the mixing of the solvent with the non-solvent so that size and size distribution of the NPs can be fine-tuned within a narrow range. A similar behaviour was observed in the formulation of NPs with hydrophobic polymers [34,35]. Indeed, the influence of the fluid dynamic parameters on the NPs properties was negligible if the suitable solvent/non-solvent ratio was satisfied. This is reminiscent of the fundamental difference with membrane emulsification, where both the flux of the disperse phase and the shear stress of the continuous phase strongly influence the droplet size distribution [57]. The important aspect of membrane nanoprecipitation is that a high flux of the polymer solution through the membrane can be achieved with low shear stress of the continuous phase without negatively affecting the NPs size."
10,PVA-H-NPs production by continuous membrane nanoprecipitation,"3.5 PVA-H-NPs production by continuous membrane nanoprecipitation The continuous production of PVA-H-NPs was carried out by single-pass cross-flow operation mode (Fig. 1 B), where the aqueous polymer solution meets the organic phase in the lumen of the membrane module in the appropriate volume ratio. This mode of operation has never been used before for the preparation of PVA particles. It has only been tested for the preparation of liposomes [38] and drug nanocrystals [40]. In the present work, this method permitted to fine-tune at the membrane pore level the conditions necessary to promote nanoprecipitation by simply acting on the fluid dynamic parameters, such as the volumetric flow rate of the polymer solution through the membrane pores and the axial flow rate of the non-solvent. Different S/NS volume ratios (from 0.06 to 0.5) were obtained by setting the flow rate of the aqueous polymer solution to 7 mL min−1 (134 L h−1 m−2) and varying the axial flow rate of the organic phase from 120 to 14 mL min−1. As observed in batch membrane nanoprecipitation, an increase in particle size was obtained with increasing S/NS volumetric ratio (Fig. 8 A). At the same volumetric range, i.e., up to 0.08, a much lower PDI for the same average size (ca 250 nm) was obtained with continuous (Fig. 8 B) compared to batch membrane nanoprecipitation (Fig. 6B). Indeed, a uniform distribution (PDI < 0.2) was observed in continuous membrane nanoprecipitation up to a S/NS volumetric ratio of 0.3 for an average size of about 700 nm. After this S/SN volume ratio a polydisperse formulation was obtained, showing particle growth due to agglomeration [13]. Fig. 8 also shows the particle size and particle size distribution of PVA-H-NPs prepared by conventional stirring (batch nanoprecipitation) (data redrawn from Fig. 3B for easy of comparison). It is noteworthy that a lower agglomeration tendency was observed for NPs prepared by the continuous method, as previously reported for other nanosuspensions prepared by membrane nanoprecipitation, compared to those prepared by conventional stirring [40]. PVA-H-NPs produced by batch nanoprecipitation were homogeneous with a PDI of less than 0.2 until a S/NS volumetric ratio of 0.06 was reached (corresponding to a fPVA of 3.5 × 10−4 and fH2O of 0.07), the further increase determined an increase in particle size (460 nm) and PDI (0.234). PVA-H-NPs produced by continuous membrane nanoprecipitation maintained their uniform size distribution until a S/NS volumetric ratio of 0.3 was reached (corresponding to a fPVA of 1.4 × 10−3 and fH2O of 0.28). The data indicated that single-pass cross-flow membrane nanoprecipitation permitted to shift considerably to higher polymer fractions, which enlarged the operating conditions for the production of stable and uniform NPs by the nanoprecipitation method. This is quite remarkable as it leads to higher concentration of final PVA-H-NPs. The increase of the volumetric ratio between the two phases, from 0.06 (6 v %) to 0.3 (30 v %), permitted to increase the productivity of the process (in terms of mass of NPs produced in relation to mass fraction of solvent and non-solvent) by an order of magnitude (from 0.04 to 0.2 wt %) at high throughput (flux of polymer solution = 134 L h−1m−2) and under mild operating conditions (wall shear stress = 0.002 Pa). Moreover, comparison of the data reported in Fig. 8 for NPs prepared by continuous membrane nanoprecipitation (PDI < 0.2 up to S/NS of 0.3), with those reported in Fig. 3 B (redrawn here for ease of comparison) for NPs prepared by conventional stirred nanoprecipitation (PDI < 0.2 up to S/NS 0.07), suggests that the continuous single-pass cross-flow membrane nanoprecipitation system is capable of producing uniform NPs outside the stable (green) zone identified in the batch constructed ouzo diagram (Fig. 2 A). We speculate that the reason for this unexpected result lies in the fine micromixing achieved at the pore level between the solvent containing the polymer and the organic non-solvent, and the subsequent rapid removal of the formed particles from the pore microenvironment, under the axial flow rate in continuous single-pass mode. The result opens new scenarios that require further deepening of fundamental mechanisms to fully exploit the promising perspectives of the technology. Moreover, the stability of the process for the continuous production of PVA NPs was confirmed by the constant particle size distribution and transmembrane pressure along the experimental time (45 min). The effect of membrane pore size on particle size was also investigated (Fig. 9 A and B). At the same S/NS volumetric ratio, uniform particles in the same size range were produced when membranes with different pore sizes (0.6 and 5 μm) were used, confirming that in membrane nanoprecipitation the particle size is not controlled by the pore size of the membranes, as is the case, on the contrary, in membrane emulsification [34–36]."
11,Conclusions,"A scalable method for the continuous production of uniform PVA-H-NPs by membrane nanoprecipitation was demonstrated. The thorough characterization of the starting materials by using the conventional stirring nanoprecipitation method allowed to indicate that the production of PVA-H-NPs by nanoprecipitation can be tuned by modifying the polymer concentration and the solvent/non-solvent volumetric ratio. The presence of surfactant (Pluronic F127) was necessary to control the nanoprecipitation process. The PVA-H-NPs prepared using membrane technology had smaller and more uniform particles than those prepared using the conventional stirring method (with the same solvent/non-solvent ratio). This was attributed to better control of solvent/non-solvent mixing at the membrane pore level. Moreover, the continuous production of uniform (PDI < 0.2) PVA-H-NPs by single-pass cross-flow membrane nanoprecipitation was successfully carried out by simply acting on the fluid dynamic parameters, such as the volumetric flow rates of the polymer solution through the membrane and the non-solvent phase along the lumen side, respectively. The continuous cross-flow operation mode permitted to increase the process productivity (mass of PVA-H-NPs produced with respect to the mass fraction of solvent and non-solvent) by an order of magnitude with high throughput and mild operating conditions thanks to its ability to regulate the solution addition and produce uniform nano-sized particles. The work proved that membrane nanoprecipitation can be a valid candidate for the mass production of H-NPs, both because of the good control of particle size and particle size distribution, and because of the easy scalability of the membrane processes. It is expected that the development of new methods to produce H-NPs will expand the application of polymeric hydrogels to develop smart systems for environmental protection and more efficient systems for various healthcare needs. On the other hand, a deep insight into the key role of different process operating conditions will expand the potential application of membranes in particle technology."
