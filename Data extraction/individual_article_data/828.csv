0,Introduction,"Rapid scale-up of energy technologies are urgently required in modern society, particularly in terms of “accessibility”, “sustainability”, “environment”, “efficiency”, “feasibility” and “reliability” [1,2]. Unfortunately, the global warming driven by fossil fuels is one of the most recent global problems which directly affect the human health. Upon increasing the world population and rapid growing of modern societies, the demand of energy has increasing dramatically, where the conventional energy resources can not completely fulfill the “end uses of energy” requirements. Transportation is one of the “end uses of energy” which deliver energy consumption at an annual average rate of approximately 1.4% ranging from 104 to 155 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) between the years 2012 to 2040 [3]. Virtually the world energy consumption, particularly in developing countries, must meet the requirements of the standard of living, therefore, many nonrenewable energy resources have to be replaced with renewable energy resources. Solar [4], wind [5], and hydro [6] are three major primary renewable energy sources used for clean energy production. However, there are some deficiencies such as geographic limitations, high production/conversion cost and intermittency which limited the wide range applications of these resources [7]. Other alternatives such as energy carriers are invented for energy production. Hydrogen is a secondary energy sources generating from water splitting, thermochemical, electrolytic, and biological processes [8,9]. Though hydrogen has the highest energy per mass (E/M) as compared to other fuels; however, it has a low energy per unit volume (E/V) i.e. low ambient temperature density [10]. This deficiency can be overcome by hydrogen storage via adsorption on the surfaces of solids or absorption within solids, or both. So far, in this field, various solid-state porous materials are reported as a host for hydrogen storage such as: - Nanosized carbon materials such as graphene (Gr) [11], and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [12]. - Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) [13]. - Metal oxides (MOs) and Mixed metal oxides (MMOs) [14]. - Hydrides such as metal hydrides (MHs) and complex metal hydrides (CMHs) [15]. - Alloys [16]. - Polymers [17]. - (Nano)composites [18]. All above materials posed especial characteristics which made them appropriate for hydrogen storage such as active chemical compositions, porous structures, crystallinity, and catalytic features. These characteristics are crucial in designing an efficient hydrogen storage system. Metal-oxides with more than one metal cation, and at least one redox species have been examined in our research teams [19]. It was observed that these materials can adsorb hydrogen in an alkaline medium. MMO-NPs also showed superior discharge capacities as compared to other materials reported in this field. Unfortunately, the discharge/charge efficiencies of these materials are almost low ranging from 40% to 70%. This deficiency can be overcome via crosslinking/interacting of MMOs with other materials such as those with large surface areas (like layered materials), or functional-conductive materials (like conductive polymers) . Several hanging bands on the surface of nanomaterials and also structural defects govern the hydrogen storage performances of these materials, while low specific surface area and weak electron conductivity of these materials are two major obstacles [20,21]. As mentioned before, designing self-assembled materials and composite-materials are two major solutions to MMOs limitations in hydrogen storage where nanomaterials particularly with complex morphology and structure can enlarge specific surface area, provide more sites for hydrogen, and make ions/electrons transportation easier. In our nanotechnology laboratory, we have started working on various compositions of molybdate-based MMOs and studied their abilities in hydrogen storage [22,23]. These compositions illustrate catalytic activity, and therefore used in supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, light-emitting diode, laser, and solar cell. The structure is made by double molybdate compounds at which a bivalent metal cation and a trivalent rare earth ion. In molybdate-based MMOs, the mechanism of hydrogen adsorption can be done through the insertion of hydrogen protons on the surface (physisorption) or/and into the defects of formed-OH- ions. In addition, the existence of metal cations with more than one oxidation states (i.e. redox species) can promote the extent of hydrogen adsorption, and therefore discharge capacities such as zirconium in Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 [24], iron (Fe) in Dy3Fe5O12 and DyFeO3 [25], chromium (Cr) in LaCrO3 [26] and so on. Self-assembly of MMOs with layered materials (or MMOs coated layered materials) such as nanoclay, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have been reported in energy storage systems. Among these layered materials, nanoclays (NCs) particularly montmorillonite (MMT) is considered as supporting materials. MMT is a type of nanoclays with the chemical structure of Mx(Al4−xMgx)Si8O20(OH)4 (M: monovalent cation, x: degree of isomorphs ranging from 0.5 to 1.3) [27]. MMT has a uniform morphology with nanolayered structure, highly crystalline, with tetrahedral – octahedral – tetrahedral (TOT) structure. At the surface of MMT, there are plenty of hydroxyl groups (–OH), which are crucial for catalytic reactions [28]. MMT can be used for assembly the functional nanoparticles (NPs) due to its superior surface area, hydrophilic surface, interlayered distance, and high stability. In solid-state hydrogen storage technology, particularly in MMO-hydrogen storage materials, the formation of oxygen vacancies is important in improvement of catalytic performances of MMOs. It is crucial to decrease the formation energy of oxygen vacancies at the interface structure [29]. In fact, the surface-hydroxyl groups of MMOs induce the formation of oxygen vacancies. It is known that the surface dehydration process of MMOs and MOs can be hinder using MMT, where the charge transfer can be occurred at the interface. The charge transfer turns up using the highly diffusible protons, which can further enhance catalytic performances of hydrogen storage profiles. [30] All above findings helped us to design a new self-assembled materials based CuCe2(MoO4)4/MMT (K10). Primarily, the well-known Pechini method was utilized to synthesize CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles. For the first time, four different chelating agents (trimesic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, and malonic acid) are used to examine their effects on the formation of nanoparticles. In the same vein, to hinder the surface dehydration, MMT-K10 was used to enhance hydrogen storage performances of the system."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The starting reagents in this study was supplied from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. These reagents include copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O), cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O), ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24), trimesic acid (C9H6O6), maleic acid (C4H4O4), succinic acid (C4H6O4), malonic acid (C3H4O4), triethylenetetramine ([CH2NHCH2CH2NH2]2) and propane-1,2-diol (CH3CHCH2OH)."
3,Preparation of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles,"2.2 Preparation of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles Pechini method using various chelating agents (trimesic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, and malonic acid) was used for preparation of pure and crystalline CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles. Here, the acidic medium is used in order to chelate most metal ions, with various number of carboxylate groups. This can improve cross-linking to form gel. The gelled composites are further sintered to pyrolysis the organic phase and left nanoparticles, which are reduced by further calcinations. Through calcination, the organic tails of the formed complex breakdown, where the cations are oxidized in order to form mixed metal oxides crystals. In this synthesis route, primarily, 0.33 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 10 ml of distilled water and stirred for 10 min. Into this solution, an aqueous solution containing 1.2 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was added and vigorously stirred, in order to obtain a homogeneous solution. In the next step, 1.12 g of malonic acid [C3H4O4] was added as a chelating agent. The molar ratio of chelating agent to nitrate was kept being 3:1. Subsequently, the aqueous solution of 0.97 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was added into above solution under continuous stirring at 80 °C for 30 min. The pH of the mixed solution was regulated to around 7–8 using diluted triethylenetetramine. Finally, an appropriate amount of propane-1,2-diol with molar ratio of 1:1 to malonic acid was added. The resulting solution was further stirred and heated until evaporation of water. The obtained viscose solution was converted into a porous solid precursor after overnight drying at 100 °C and calcination at 500 °C for 3 h. In order to achieve optimum sample, the effect of various chelating agents on the morphology, particle size and electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles were examined, following the similar procedure."
4,Preparation of self-assembled CuCe2(MoO4)4/MMT-K10 nanocomposites,"2.3 Preparation of self-assembled CuCe2(MoO4)4/MMT-K10 nanocomposites In order to prepare CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites, 1 g MMT-K10 was dispersed in isopropyl alcohol using ultrasonic irradiation for 15 min followed by continuous stirring for 24 h at room temperature. In another container, the optimum sample (prepared in malonic acid) of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles was dispersed in isopropyl alcohol for 10 min and stirred for three hours. From this solution, 5, 10, and 20 wt% were added into the MMT-K10, sonicated (10 min) and stirred for 48 h to obtain homogeneous admixtures. Finally, the CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 samples were centrifuged, decanted, and dried at 60 °C. These samples were selected for further observations."
5,Physical and electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Physical and electrochemical measurements Herein, the crystal-phase formation and composition of the samples were recorded using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and spectroscopic analyses (FTIR and EDX). Two basic inorganic instruments i.e. X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku – Ultima iv – Japan, using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation; λ = 0.15418 nm; scanning range 5 < 2θ < 80) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR; Nicolet Magna- 550 spectrophotometer in KBr pellets ranging from 4000 to 400 cm−1) were used for identification of crystal-phase formation. The morphologies of the samples were captured using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, MIRA3 equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)), and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM30). Further physical observations were recorded using ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV–Vis-DRS, Shimadzu - UV-1800, Japan), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller - Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BET-BJH) (applied at −196 ˚C, Tristar 3000, Micromeritics). Finally, the electrochemical performances of the samples were measured primarily using a cyclic voltammogram (CV- using KOH in the 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0, scan rate of 0.1 V−1) and eventually by using a chronopotentiometer (GC-2550TG, Teif Gostar Faraz Company-Iran, in a 6 M KOH solution and ± 1 mA constant current). The latter was used in order to study the hydrogen storage potency of the samples in a standard three-electrode setup. In this electrochemical cell, platinum (Pt) was used as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and a coated-copper-plate (surface area ∼ 1 × 1 cm2) as a working electrode."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural analysis of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles,"3.1 Structural analysis of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles In the current study, an attempt has been developed to synthesis “pure”, “nanosized”, and “crystalline” CuCe2(MoO4)4 in various chelating agents such as trimesic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, and malonic acid. The obtaining products from each category were characterized in terms of their crystal structures by XRD (Fig. 1 a). It was observed, after calcination at 500 °C, almost similar diffractograms with some intense peaks. It was recognized that the sample prepared in malonic acid is more crystalline as compared to other chelating agents. These patterns indicate that the CuCe2(MoO4)4 is purely formed, almost without any impurities. In these patterns, a series of intense peaks at around 29°, 31°, 34°, 46°, 49°, 53°, and 62°. It must be noted that this structure is almost new, and its respective JCPDS card is not reported. The equations like M−R2(MoO4)4 (M: metal (II) cations and R: rare-earth (III) cations) with twofold molybdate structure are famous sub-categories of molybdate based complex metal oxides (MCMOs). Scherrer equation is used to measure the average crystallite size (D) of the optimum sample (prepared in malonic acid), where obtained to be around 17 nm. In order to confirm the purity of the samples, the optimum CuCe2(MoO4)4 sample was taken for elemental analysis (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the result illustrated the purity of the sample containing only oxygen (O), cerium (Ce), copper (Cu), and Molybdenum (Mo). In this pattern, several peaks are raised for Ce (Mα, Lβ1, Lβ2, Ly11, Ly1) and Cu (Lα, Kα, Kβ). The existence of multi-electron shells which illustrate multi-transitions, from one energy state to another. Further investigations on structural formation, particularly (metal–oxygen) M−O and metal–oxygen-metal (M−O−M) bands were studied using FTIR analysis (Fig. 1c). In this spectrum, two successive bands at 3433 cm−1 and 1628 cm−1 are assigned for vibration frequencies of –OH group. The vibrational frequencies underneath 1000 cm−1 (i.e. at 913 cm−1, 818 cm−1, 717 cm−1, and 522 cm−1) are related to metal–oxygen-metal and oxygen-metal–oxygen. For instance, three successive stretching at 913, 818, and 717 cm−1 are related to the MoO2 vibrations, or a vibration frequency at around 522 cm−1 is assigned with M−O groups. The surface morphology of the samples was analyzed using FESEM (Fig. 2 ). The morphology of CuCe2(MoO4)4 synthesized in trimesic acid (Fig. 2a) is composed of several irregular-agglomerated particles. Almost similar morphologies can be observed on FESEM micrographs of the samples synthesized against maleic acid (Fig. 2b), and succinic acid (Fig. 2C), i.e. heterogeneous-irregular-agglomerated morphologies, with almost wide particle distributions. This phenomenon is more obvious in the sample prepared in succinic acid. Fig. 2d shows the surface morphology of the sample synthesized in malonic acid. This micrograph is denser as compared to other samples, the particles are homogeneously distributed and in the regular zones. Based on the structural analyses, this sample (synthesized in malonic acid) was selected for further studies and nanocomposite-based montmorillonite formation. To confirm the nanoscale-formation of CuCe2(MoO4)4 synthesized in malonic acid, complementary morphological studies were worked up using TEM (Fig. 2e), and the geometry of the particles were estimated. It can be observed that the nanoparticles are homogenously formed in the range of 10 – 50 nm, with average maximum particle distribution range of 20 – 25 nm (Fig. 2f). The contrast between dark and bright sections on the TEM image means formation of highly crystalline and dense particles."
8,Structural analysis of CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites,"3.2 Structural analysis of CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites As mentioned before, it aims to design novel materials suitable for hydrogen storage. Multi-layer/functional materials are reported as promising materials in this field. Based on previous studies, we assumed that the self-assembled materials consisting of a layered system such as nanoclay (NC) and a mixed metal oxide can be used as a host for hydrogen storage. Therefore, after careful consideration, the optimum sample of as-synthesized CuCe2(MoO4)4 were selected and used for nanocomposite formation with montmorillonite K10 (the method of production is explained in experimental). Primarily, the composition of the nanocomposite was examined using XRD and compared with pristine K10 (Fig. 3 a). It can be observed that the nanocomposites are formed where the CuCe2(MoO4)4 peaks are growth at different 2θ, while the rest of the peaks are overlapped with nanoclay diffraction peaks. Nanoclay K10 shows several intense peaks arises at 2θ around 5.5° (dspac. = 16.1 Å), 8.8° (dspac. = 10.0 Å), 17.7° (dspac. = 5.0 Å), 20.8° (dspac. = 4.3 Å), 26.7° (dspac. = 3.3 Å), 35.0° (dspac. = 2.6 Å), 45.5° (dspac. = 2.0 Å), 50.1° (dspac. = 1.8 Å), and 60.0° (dspac. = 1.9 Å) correspond to montmorillonite compositions. In addition, the XRD pattern of K10 consists of several successive small peaks. It is reported that, the basal spacing (d001) of K10 tetrahedral-octahedral-tetrahedral (TOT) structure of K10 grows at 2θ = 8.8°. The remarkable similarities can be observed between K10 diffractograms and nanocomposites, but different intensities. It can be observed that the assigned-diffractograms of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles are growth approximately at similar angle, distinguishable with original patterns of nanoparticles. However, the intensity of the peaks in nanocomposites are depressed as compared to the original patterns of K10 and CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles, indicating interaction between nanoclay and nanoparticles. Comparison between d-spacing illustrates that the clay structure is retained unchanged, and the majority of interaction is on the surface of nanoclay. However, the diffraction angles, intensities and d-spacing of the clay, after composition, are changed. For example, the nanoclay d001 at 2θ = 8.83° with d-spacing of 10.01 Å, and intensity of around 2000 a.u. are changed to 2θ = 8.82°, d-spacing = 10.02 Å, and intensity of 750 a.u., respectively, after interaction. FTIR analysis was performed to follow up the structural formation of nanocomposites (Fig. 3b). The FTIR spectrum of K10 consists of some intense bands at –OH stretching at 3447 and 1632 cm−1, Si–O stretching at 1045 cm−1 and 980 cm−1, and finally -Si–O bending at 524, 467 and 410 cm−1), respectively. In the same vein, the FTIR spectum of CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites illustrates almost a similar pattern, but slightly different wavenumber. EDX spectrum of CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites confirms the formation of nanocomposites including all elemental compositions (Fig. 3c). The FESEM micrographs of the nanocomposites deduced the surface interaction of CuCe2(MoO4)4 with K10 (Fig. 3d). Further investigation by HRTEM clearly confirms the nanocomposite formation. The HRTEM of the sample indicates the lattice fringes of around 0.197 nm, assigned to the diffraction angle of 2θ = 45.5° (Fig. 3e). Dual decisive points for advanced materials in the field of hydrogen storage are “large surface area” and “high porosity”. The BET-BJH profiles of three samples i.e. CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs, montmorillonite K10, and K10/CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanocomposites are compared in Fig. 4 , and their respective parameters are tabulated in Table 1 . The BET adsorption–desorption plot of CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs (Fig. 4a) shows almost a similar pattern close to H3 hysteresis loop. The characteristics of Type III-isotherm are with “aggregated medium”, “slit-shaped pores” and “non-uniform size distribution”. In the similar vein, the K10 (Fig. 4b), and its respective K10/CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanocomposites (Fig. 4c) imply type IV-isotherm, featuring of mesoporous materials with highly uniform pore size distribution. Comparison between surface areas illustrate a much larger surface area of nanocomposites (201.49 m2/g) as compared to CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs (5.8943 m2/g), with corresponding pore volumes of 0.0421 and 0.3494 cm3/g respectively. It can be observed a considerable decrease in average diameter of the pores (Dave.) in nanocomposites (6.9359 nm) as compared to K10 (8.2511 nm), and CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs (28.567 nm), most probably due to the anchoring (interaction) the CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs on the inner surface of the K10 mesopores. In summary, based on BET-BJH results, particularly the specific surface area and average pore size of the nanocomposites, it can be estimated a large number of active sites appropriate for electrochemical process. High specific surface area offers a large contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode in electrochemical hydrogen storage, and as a result a fast ion transfer at the interface [31]."
9,Electrochemical hydrogen storage performances,"3.3 Electrochemical hydrogen storage performances As aimed in this study, a self-assembled material comprising CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs and K10 silicate layers were synthesized as a promising working electrode material in an electrochemical hydrogen storage system. Successive adsorption (charging) and desorption (discharging) are important in hydrogen evolution, to show “hydrogen content” and “efficiency” of the system. Electrochemical hydrogen storage of solid-state materials are defined based on “reversibility” with “high efficiency”. In this section, primarily, the electrochemical performance of all samples (either nanoparticles or nanocomposites) was analyzed using cyclic voltammogram (CV) (Fig. 5 ) and their respective results are summarized in Table 2 . In any CV, there are two important variables: fitting greatness of the current and rectangular sort. It can be observed that, in an alkaline medium, the CVs of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticls are larger than nanocomposites, where CuCe2(MoO4)4 synthesized in malonic acid shows higher cathodic and anodic currents of −54.66 and 56.18 mA, respectively. Upon increasing the percentages of CuCe2(MoO4)4 in nanocomposites, the electrochemical responses of nanocomposites reach larger values. Now, it can be assumed that, the mixed metal oxide (MMO) having active redox species affect the electrochemical responses of an inert materials (here K10). This phenomenon can further affect the hydrogen storage properties of the nanocomposites. Three-electrodes electrochemical systems were worked up for all CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs (Fig. 6 ) and CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites (Fig. 7 ) using chronopotentiometer. As we expected, our optimum sample shows a superior discharge capacity after 20 sequences of charging/discharging. The maximum discharge capacity of CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs synthesized in malonic acid shows highest discharge capacity of around 6000 mAh/g. Structural features of this sample like purity, and also presence of three metal sites govern the hydrogen storage performance of the sample. In general, due to the low porosity of crystalline-nanosized-MMOs, the charge–discharge efficiency of this class of materials is almost low, for example, the maximum efficiency of CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs synthesized in malonic acid is<50% (∼46%). After surface interaction of nanoparticles with montmorillonite K10, the electrochemical activities of resulting nanocomposites are enhanced as compared to pristine montmorillonite K10. As we discussed before, the layered materials like K10 show almost a large surface area and porosity, but very low electrical/electrochemical responses. This deficiency can overcome over interaction with electroactive materials such as MMO-NPs. In the current study, the hydrogen storage performances of three nanocomposites were compared with montmorillonite K10 (Fig. 7). It is obvious that upon increasing the concentration of CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs from 5 to 20 wt%, the electrochemical responses in terms of “discharge capacity” are reached higher values. For instance, the maximum discharge capacity of CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites with 20 wt% of CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs is measured to be around 3750 mAh/g, larger than the samples with 5 wt% (∼2750 mAh/g), and 10 wt% (∼3000 mAh/g), respectively. In an electrochemical energy storage system, the overall reaction reversibility depends on the voltage differences of discharging and charging, and also the minimum cell voltage for discharging. Considering the electrochemical properties of the samples, we anticipate that the CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites may have excellent charge–discharge properties. This was confirmed when the maximum charge–discharge efficiency of the CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites containing 20 wt% of CuCe2(MoO4)4-NPs was obtained to be around 70%, that is higher than pristine nanoparticles (Fig.S1-S2 of Supplementary materials). The Despite morphological and bulk structural characteristics of the CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites, the presence of MMO-nanoparticles on the surface of K10 provide multi-level sites for hydrogen adsorption, where the hydrogen atoms can preferably anchor on the surfaces of either MMOs or K10 by mostly physical adsorption. It is also reported that the existence of redox species can increase the hydrogen storage performance. In CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles, copper (Cu), cerium (Ce) and molybdenum (Mo) are possessed different oxidation states, however the Cu2+ and Mo6+ are in their highest oxidation states, therefore the Ce3+ can be counted as an active redox species in this composition. The overall hydrogen adsorption mechanism can be proposed as Eq.1; CuCe2(MoO4)4 + xH2O + xe- ↔ CuCe2(MoO4)4─Hx + xOH- (1). In addition, the overall hydrogen storage mechanism of this nanocomposites can be matched with spillover mechanism involves [32,33]: (a) Dissociation of hydrogen molecules (H2) to hydrogen atoms (H) (b) Adsorption of mobile H-atoms on the surface of MMO-NPs (c) Diffusion of H-atoms in weakly-bound states on the K10 (d) Interaction of H atoms at preferential locations (outer and inner layers) Though spillover mechanism is explained by many scientists [34–41], however, the overall implications on this mechanism in hydrogen storage profiles of layered materials are still critically assessed. Last but not the least, the “future energy needs” required “designing” of novel materials for clean energy production, which can meet all requirements reported by US-department of energy (DOE) in the field of solid-state hydrogen storage materials. We believe that MMO-NPs can fulfill the requirements in this field, owing to their structural and morphological flexibilities, however, some deficiencies of this class of electroactive materials MUST be overcome by linking/anchoring with other substrates like layered materials."
10,Conclusions,"In this paper, CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via Pechini method using chelating agents. Pure and crystalline CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles were obtained in the presence of malonic acid. This was evaluated by structural analyses and morphological observations. In order to improve the properties of above-mentioned nanoparticles for hydrogen storage, montmorillonite K10 was used as a supporting material. The physical properties of the nanocomposites were indicated improvement in various properties in terms of “porosity” and “specific surface area”. In an alkaline medium, the electrochemical performances of the samples were examined. It was observed that: - The CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles synthesized in malonic acid exhibit higher electrochemical activities. - The CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites containing 20 wt% nanoparticles show superior electrochemical activities. - The highest discharge capacity was obtained from the working electrode made by CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanoparticles synthesized in malonic acid to be around 6000 mAh/g. - Similarly, the optimum result for hydrogen storage was obtained from the nanocomposites doped with 20 wt% of nanoparticles (∼3750 mAh/g). In addition, the nanocomposites show higher discharge/charge efficiency as compared to the pristine materials. It can be deduced that the CuCe2(MoO4)4/K10 nanocomposites can be potentially used as host for efficient hydrogen storage."
