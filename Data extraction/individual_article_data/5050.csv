0,Introduction,"The synthesis of polypropylene (PP) in petrochemical plants [1, 2] is achieved using propylene, co-catalysts, selectivity control agents and highly sensitive catalysts such as Ziegler-Natta (ZN) (TiCl4 / MgCl2) that are affected by the presence of inhibitors [3–6]. Hernandez-Fernandez et al., quantified O2, CO, CO2, H2S, COS, CS2, CH3SH, CH3CH2SH, acetylene and methylacetylene, in the propylene matrix [7]. These oxygenated and sulfur compounds were also identified and quantified in matrixes of ethylene, propylene, liquefied petroleum gas, heavy crude oils and cracking plants using GC × GC-FID/-SCD, GC-PFPD, GC-MS [8–14]. Propylene without sulfur compounds, unsaturated hydrocarbons and permanent gases of the order of ppm, continue to show productivity losses greater than 5% [7]. Therefore, this represents challenges requiring the extension of chromatographic methods to achieve a broader characterization of the propylene, and ensure the identification and quantification of the inhibitors. A compound class of interest is that of oxygenated, which includes alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids of high polarity, which are considered inhibitors for the ZN catalysts [15, 16]. The need to identify and quantify inhibitors affecting PP production is worldwide and some researchers [17, 29] have used a methodology different from the one employed in this research. Alcohols, aldehydes and ketones were quantified in samples of gasoline, propane, propylene, petroleum derivatives and water used to clean propane transport tanks, using chromatographs with three detectors (FID, qMS and DAD-192 nm) and obtaining an RSD less than 0.01% in retention time and repeatability to two levels of concentration of 100 and 1000 ppm of less than 5% [17, 18]. Mobile near-infrared spectrometer for ethanol and methanol in gasoline shows an LOD of 0.68%, an LOQ of 2.04%, and a standard prediction error (SPE) of 0.21% [19–23]. The ethanol and 1-butanol in petroleum derivatives were also quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The uncertainty in this method was 0.56% with a repeatability between 0.12 – 3.27 [24]. Other researchers found a content of oxygenates in gasoline employing Reid steam pressure [25–29]. The linear alcohols (from C5 to C19), the branched alcohols (from C6 to C13) and the carboxylic acids (from C4 to C12) were reported in the range of 1.58 mg g−1 to 14.75 mg g−1, 0.51 mg g−1 to 1.12 mg g−1 and 0.21 mg g−1 to 1,63 mg g−1 respectively. GC x GC – TOFMS showed a linear range of 0.3 ng mL−1 to 19 ng mL−1, a precision of < 8% and a recovery range of 77 to 118% in a sample of gas liquefied from natural gas using the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis [30–39]. In past research, the sulfur compounds, unsaturated hydrocarbons and permanent gases, affecting the productivity of ZN catalyst between 5 and 22%, were quantified after developing a method by GC-PDHID/MSD/FID [7, 40]. This led to the modification in the configuration of another chromatograph, proposing a GC-PDHID/MSD/MSD, differing from that of the first research project since it replaced a FID detector with an MSD to quantify oxygenates (alcohols, ketones, carboxylic acids). This could have been accomplished using one GC-MSD, but functionality would have been sacrificed. In practical terms it would have involved increased data reporting time, less opportunity to take preventive action during the actual process, as well as the use of additional professional personnel and equipment to identify impurities. The new configuration permits continuation of the use of simultaneous methods. With one injection, the oxygenates, sulphides and permanent gases are quantified. Using this strategy, 8 columns, 7 valves and 3 detectors were combined. Using just one injection of liquid or gas propylene, information concerning 20 inhibitors was obtained which, aside from demonstrating a new chromatographic methodology, gives those searching for oil, producers of liquefied petroleum gas and developers of norms and standards, a tool to increase the productivity and sustainability of their activity. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the inhibitors for GC-PDHID/MSD/MSD is carried out in the process controls and, specifically in the area of quality control. On many occasions the information is converted into data that is provided to the areas of polymerization engineering, having little impact upon the identification and solution of the problems that affect the kinetics of the reaction of polymerization on an industrial scale. This led to the identification of the need to develop a statistical model integrating the analysis of the inhibitors and the efficiency of the polymerization reactor, permitting the prediction of the percentage in loss of productivity as a function of the concentration of 1 or all 20 of the inhibitors quantified in this research. Identifying and quantifying the synergetic effects among the 20 inhibitors, as well as their effect on the catalytic system, and being able to propose other ranges of concentrations of inhibitors that could be even more aggressive than those detected in this research, is a high priority. To achieve this prediction, multilinear regression was used. The multiple linear regression permitted the generation of a linear model in which the value of the dependent variable or response (Y) is determined from a group of independent variables called predictors (x0, x1, ..., and xn) [41]. In the multiple linear regression, more than one explanatory variable was used. This offers the advantage of entering more information in the construction of the model and, consequently, obtaining more precise estimates [41–46]. The MLR model can be expressed as: (1) Y = β 0 + β 1 × 1 + β 2 × 2 + · · · + β nxn + ε In Eq. (1) Y is the catalyst productivity, x0, x1, ..., and xn refer to the relevant factors of inhibitors, β0 is the constant value, β1, ... βn are regression coefficients, and ε is the accidental error [47–53]. That is, R-squared is the fraction by which the variance of the errors is less than the variance of the dependent variable. A high value for R-squared indicates a model of greater utility [48]. The importance of the t-test: If it is less than 0.05 it is because that independent variable is related in a significant way to the dependent variable, therefore, it influences the dependent variable; it is explanatory and helps to predict it [50]. The beta coefficient (β): This indicates the intensity and direction of the relationship between that independent variable (IV) and the dependent variable (DV): the further from 0, the stronger the relationship [41–51]. The linear regression model described is based upon experimental trials on an industrial scale. Its application is of vital importance for large-scale producers of both ZN and PP, since the model uses the data from the chromatographic method. The percentage of loss in productivity can be predicted when propylene having impurities is employed. This method is of great assistance in the control of the propylene quality before it leaves the ships transporting it. It is also valuable for determining improvements strategies promoting removal of these inhibitors, thereby producing propylene of greater purity with fewer aggressive effects for ZN catalyst. In addition, this method permits the evaluation of the efficiency of the columns that remove inhibitors. This research describes a simultaneous detection method with MSD, MSD and PDHID to quantify oxygenated compounds, thiols, sulphides and permanent gases (CO, CO2 and O2). Detection limits (LODs), quantification limits (LOQs), linearity, inter and intra-day accurecy, repeatability and intermediate precision were calculated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials A standard mixture of oxygenated compounds was used. These included 45.32 ppm of formic acid, 25.32 ppm of acetic acid, 72.67 ppm of acetone, 57.51 ppm of ethanol, 74.88 ppm of isopropyl alcohol, 39.93 ppm of methanol, 109.9 ppm of methyl tertbutyl ether, 92.36 ppm of 1-butanol, 92.36 ppm of 1-propanol, 90.22 ppm of tert-butanol, and 95.15 ppm of 2-butanol, in helium balance, obtained from Airgas Amistad-USA, LLC. A standard mixture of a homologous series of permanent gases of 5.90 ppm of carbon dioxide (CO2), 5.30 ppm of carbon monoxide (CO), 4.96 ppm of hydrogen (H2), and 6.50 ppm of oxygen (O2), in helium balance, was obtained from Airgas Amistad-USA, LLC. A standard mixture of thiols, certified by Airgas Amistad-USA, LLC was obtained, with concentrations of 1.00 ppm of butylmercaptan (CH3(CH2)3SH), 0.70 ppm of ethylmercaptan (CH3CH2SH), 0.60 ppm of carbon disulphide (CS2), 0.80 ppm of carbonyl sulphide (COS), 1.56 ppm of dimethyl sulphide (CH3)2S, 1.00 ppm of methylmercaptan (CH3SH), 0.70 ppm of n-propylmercaptan (CH3(CH2)2SH), 1.40 ppm of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and 2.283 ppm of tert-butylmercaptan, in propylene balance."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation The propylene samples were taken in liquid and gas at different sampling points: transport ships, the polymerization reactor, purification columns, storage tanks and samples of the condensates in the transportation lines. During the sampling, water and metal particulates were observed. These particulates tend to accumulate at the bottom of the tanks and later react with humidity and other impurities, to form iron, sulphide, carbon and silicon oxides. These can generate blockage, corrosion, damage to the rotor (VICI, Valco Instruments Co., Inc. part #15265) and analytical errors. The filters used for gas samples include a 7 to 15 micron NUPRO “F” (Swagelok) series compact in-line filter. The filters for liquid samples include a 2 to 7 micron NUPRO “FW” (Swagelok) series compact in-line filter."
4,GC-PDHID/MSD/MSD,"2.3 GC-PDHID/MSD/MSD Analysis of oxygenates, thiols and permanent gases: Quantification was performed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B), with a front injector (250°C, 7.88 psi, 33 mL min−1) and a back injector (250°C, 11.73 psi, 13 mL min−1). The sample was injected in gas form, using valve systems. The volume varied between 0.25 and 1.0 mL, depending upon the loop in each valve. The oven was started at 40°C x 3 min, increased to 60°C at 10°C min−1 x 4 min and increased again to 170°C at 35°C min−1. Fig. 1 shows the configuration of the GC, which had 7 valves, 8 columns and 3 detectors. 2.3.1 Columns The columns for the permanent gases were: R (HP-1, 3 m x 0.1 mm), 7a (HP-PLOT Q, 15 m x 0.53 mm x 40 μm), 7b (HP-PLOT Q, 15 m x 0.53 mm x 50 μm), 5 (HP-PLOT Q, 15 m x 0.53 mm x 40 μm), and 6 (HP-PLOT MoleSieve, 30 m x 0.53 mm x 50 μm). The columns for the thiols were: R (HP-1, 3 m x 0.1 mm), and 1 (GS-GasPro, 30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 μm). The columns for the oxygenates were: R (HP-1, 3 m x 0.1 mm), and 2 (DB-1, 100% Dimethylpolyxilosane, 60 m x 320 μm x 0.25 μm). The helium carrier gas was adjusted to a constant flow of 2.8 mL min−1. 2.3.2 Detectors Three detectors were used: MSD (Agilent 5977A), MSD (HEWLETT PACKARD 5973) and PDHID (VICI, Valco Instruments Co. Inc.). The thiols were analyzed in the MSD detector Agilent 5977A, and oxygenates in the MSD detector HEWLETT PACKARD 5973. The MSD was fitted with a 170 mm × 0.11 mm fused-silica restrictor (Agilent G3185-60362) to achieve a fixed flow rate of 1.4 mL min−1 He. The system worked in Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) mode and the acquisition parameters for the oxygenates, sulphides and thiols are shown in Table 1 . Permanent gases were analyzed with the PDHID detector. The PDHID requires helium of very high purity to maintain a stable, low noise discharge arc. To help ensure that the carrier helium is free of atmospheric gases, a Valco helium gas purifier, or “getter,” was included with the instrument. UHP, or carrier grade helium was attached to the inlet line of the purifier, and the outlet line was then attached to the high-purity inlet bulkhead located at the back of the gas chromatograph. 2.3.3 Valves The set of valves is used to transport refinery grade propylene (RGP) and polymer grade propylene (PGP) to the columns and then to the detectors of interest. Each valve possesses three main components: the air actuator which switches the valve, the valve body which includes the shaft, and the valve rotor. The actuator is a rotating piston and its angle of rotation depends upon the type of valve. The actuator requires a supply gas of either dry air or nitrogen at 55 psig. The valve body consists of four main parts: the shaft, the valve head, the driver, and the screw. The valve head has an even number of entrance and exit ports for 1/16"" tubing. It houses the valve rotor, and has two “stops.” The driver rotates between them. The ports of the valve head align with the grooves of the valve rotor and allow for the manipulation of flows by rotating the valve. The rotor is a small cylindrical metal object with a tab that fits into the driver of the valve and is surrounded by a soft black (or occasionally white) polymer with milled grooves. Its soft material can often be damaged simply from column material or a small fleck of glass wool. However, the rotor is most susceptible to damage from the sample itself. Therefore, it is necessary in all valve applications that the sample be filtered properly before injection into the system. The filter for gas samples includes a 7 to 15 micron NUPRO “F” (Swagelok) series compact in-line filter. Filters for liquid samples included a 2 to 7 micron NUPRO “FW” (Swagelok) series compact in-line filter. Variable restrictors were employed in the valve chromatography to provide a steady flow of gases. Fig. 1 shows that seven valves (Valco Instruments Co. Inc. # part 15201, 15545-005, 15301, 15501) were used. Valves 1, 2 and 3 participate in the analysis of permanent gases; valves 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 participate in the analysis of the sulphides and thiols traces; and valves 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 participate in the analysis of the oxygenated traces. The loop sizes of valves 2, 3 and 5 are 0.25 mL, and 1.0 mL in valve 4. Valve1 (# part 15201) has 4 ports. Fig. 1 shows that in the “off” position it allows the propylene to pass through the R column and the vaporizer, to purge the loops of valves 2, 3, 4 and 7. The propylene samples are transported to columns 7a and 2. The hydrocarbons, with a molecular weight equal to or greater than that of propylene, are retained in Column 7a. The separation of CO2 from other compounds of a similar chemical nature and molecular weight, is carried out in column 7b. Column 1 is employed to separate the thiol compounds, and column 4, the oxygenates, from the propylene matrix. They are eluted and quantified in the two MSD detectors. Valve 2 assumes the ON position at 1.45 min. This places the sample in the carrier stream where it is transported to column 5. Column 5 retains the CO2 and the heaviest components while allowing CO and lighter components to elute in column 6, where it separates the light components before eluting in the detector."
5,Method validation,"2.4 Method validation 2.4.1 Calibration curve To dilute the standards, a Wasson-ECE instrument was used (serial # 150911DB), which consists of a gas sample inlet (1/16” A-lok bulkhead), a gas sample vent, a diluent gas control, 2u union filters (part number 1526), and capillary tubing of 50 cm x 0.05 mm (part number S0168). All lines were 1/16” and all sample lines were fused silica lines; the heated line was controlled by Watlow SD. The flow path inside the blender consisted of a fused silica lined sample inlet, tubing, and a head bridge. In the gas phase, the concentration of the final mixture was a function of flow rates of the sample and the diluent gas. The diluent gas was grade 6 high purity helium, with a purity of 99.9999%. To generate the multipoint calibration curve the standards of the compound mixture were used. Multiple dilutions were carried out, which permitted obtaining the approximate concentration ranges for compounds such as: formic acid (20, 10, 5 and 2 ppm), acetic acid (10, 5, 2 and 1 ppm), acetone (50, 20, 10 and 5 ppm), methanol (10, 5, 2 and 1 ppm), isopropyl alcohol (50, 20, 10 and 2 ppm), ethanol (20, 5, 0.5 and 0.1 ppm), 1-propanol (50, 1, 0.5 and 0.1 ppm), 1-butanol (50, 20, 10 and 5 ppm), 2-butanol (50, 20, 10 and 5 ppm) and tert-butanol (50, 20, 10 and 5 ppm). The permanent gases were diluted to 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 ppm and the thiols to 0.5, 0.25, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025 ppm. 2.4.2 Accuracy Accuracy refers to the closeness of agreement between the test result and the accepted reference value, namely the conventionally true value. The accuracy takes into account the total error, i.e. systematic and random errors, related to the test result [54]. In most validation protocols reported in the literature, accuracy and trueness [55] are calculated by executing at least 5 determinations per concentration, and deviation below 15% from the expected value [55] is recommended as an acceptance criterion. The calculations were obtained using the relative errors (Er), T-Value y P-Value. Accuracy was considered optimal if the bias was below 15% and acceptable if it fell between 15% and 20%. An analyte's intra- and inter-day accuracy was considered validated if the average over all calibration levels was below 20% [54, 55]. 2.4.3 Precision The precision of the chromatographic method was evaluated by studying repeatability and intermediate precision. To carry out the repeatability study, analysis of 6 replicates was performed, on the same day, for the inhibitors of interest. The calculations were obtained using the RSD [56, 57]. 2.4.4 Linearity, LODs and LOQs To calculate linearity, 5 levels of concentration for each of the compounds of interest were used. The levels of concentration were: formic acid (2 to 45.32 ppm), acetic acid (1 to 25.32 ppm), acetone (5 to 72.67 ppm), methanol (1 to 39.93 ppm), isopropyl alcohol (2 to 74.88 ppm), ethanol (0.1 to 57.51 ppm), 1-propanol (0.1 to 92.36 ppm), 1-butanol (5 to 92.36 ppm), 2-butanol (5 to 95.15 ppm), tert-butanol (5 to 90.22 ppm), CO2 (0.5 to 5.0 ppm), CO (0.002 to 5.049 ppm), O2 (0.5 to 6.5 ppm), CH3(CH2)3SH (0.025 to 2.238 ppm), CH3CH2SH (0.025 to 1.595 ppm), COS (0.025 to 1.477 ppm), CH3SH (0.025 to 1.223 ppm), CH3(CH2)2SH (0.025 to 1.880 ppm), CS2 (0.025 to 1.929 ppm), H2S (0.025 to 0.847 ppm) and tert-butylmercaptan (0.025 to 2.283 ppm) Linearity was evaluated graphically, was response vs analyte concentrations and expressed by the correlation coefficient (r2). The LODs were established as the concentration of analytes that gave a signal to noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3). The LOQs was determined as the concentration that gave a signal to noise ratio of 10 (S/N = 10) [56, 57]."
6,Multiple linear regression model (MLR),"2.5 Multiple linear regression model (MLR) Based upon the selection of modeling variables through correlation analysis, the MLR model was adopted to accurately identify the productivity of the ZN catalyst in the production of PP on an industrial scale as a function of the concentration of inhibitors such as: formic acid, acetic acid, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, methanol, ethanol, 1-butanol, 1-propanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, CH3CH2SH, H2S, COS, CS2, CH3SH, CH3(CH2)2SH, CH3(CH2)3SH, CO, CO2 and O2. The results were then compared with the actual productivity and the values of the concentration of the inhibitors determined by the GC-PDHID/MSD/MSD. The statistical analysis of the samples was carried out with the Minitab 18 statistics software (Copyright © 2019 Minitab, LLC. V.18)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Optimized chromatographic conditions,"3.1 Optimized chromatographic conditions The analytic strategy permitted taking optimum advantage of the three detectors: MSD, PDHID and MSD. These seek to improve the sensitivity and establish the structural elucidation and selectivity. The simultaneous operation, or the combination of the MSD, PHID and MSD in one sole GC, provides a greater analytic capacity, an optimization in the response time, and the opportunity to take preventive and corrective actions during the process in production plants. This is much more efficient and effective than when each one of these detectors is employed independently. Since these three detectors are highly selective in the detection of oxygenates, thiols and permanent gases, an additional advantage is obtained which is reflected in the lower column temperature and column heating rate . This increases their lifespan, since there is a lower burden on the chromatographic separation, resulting in increased analytic efficiency. The incorporation of the 7 valves, aligned in a series with optimum time lapses between them, guarantees that representative volumes of propylene will reach each one of the 8 columns, permitting the correct separation of the compounds of interest in this research. The strategy of relying on the columns, which carried out dual functions in the same time frame, assuring correct separation, as well as acting as absorbents or traps for specific compounds, guaranteed another positive result of the methodology. This is the case of column 7a which seeks to retain the propylene and the heavier compounds, permitting the CO2 and the lighter compounds to elute to column 7b. There the CO2 is separated from the lighter components. In addition, column 5 retained the CO2 and the compounds with a higher boiling point allowing the CO and molecules of higher steam pressure to flow to column 6, where the lighter components were separated before eluting to the detector. This strategy permitted a complete elution of the permanent gases."
9,"Detection of alcohols, ketones and carboxylic acids","3.2 Detection of alcohols, ketones and carboxylic acids The strategy of the separation of alcohols, ketones, carboxylic acids and thiols in column R (HP-1, 3 m x 0.1 mm) and column 2 (DB-1, 100% Dimethylpolyxilosane, 60 m x 320 μm x 0.25 μm), using an MSD is shown in Fig. 2 . Here, the chromatograms for quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (qMS) are shown. In Table 1 the SIM parameters were established for the oxygenated compounds to guarantee an adequate monitoring of ions, qualifier and quantifier ions were determined. The qMS chromatograms showed the presence of the ten oxygenated compounds, of which 2 were carboxylic acids, 1 was a ketone and 7 were alcohols. The acetic acid, formic acid, acetone, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and tert-butanol showed repeatability (RSD) in an area less than 0.6 % and its values varied between 0.21% for 1-propanol – 0.59 % for methanol. Methanol and acetic acid showed the greatest variations. For this list of oxygenates the intermediate precision in the area was less than 0.86% and its range of variation was 0.33% for 1-propanol – 0.85% for formic acid. For the retention time, the intermediate precision was below 0.2% and varied between 0.01% 1-propanol - 0.19% for formic acid. All the statistical information presented in Table 2 shows that the repeatability and intermediate precision did not show a significant statistical difference for the retention times. It was greater for the areas, but even so, the two parameters showed values of less than 1%. This evaluation shows that the chromatographic method proposed for these oxygenated compounds is independent of external factors such as the competence of the chromatograph operators, the manner in which the standards were injected, and human error, among others. Table 3 shows the inter and intra-day accuracy of oxygenates, thiols and permanent gas. For the inter-day analyzes, it is observed that 60% of the inhibitors presented Er <1.0%, 35% showed Er between 1.0 and 3.0%. Only acetic acid had an Er value of 9.5%. Only 6 samples (formic acid, acetic acid, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, CO and CH3(CH3)3SH presented P-Values less than 0.05%, indicating that there were significant differences at 95% confidence level. 15% from the expected value is recommended as an acceptance criterion [55]. Intra-day analyzes showed that 60% of the inhibitors had Er <1.0%, 25% showed Er between 1.0 and 3.0%. 15% of the remaining compounds were made up of acetic acid, O2 and CH3(CH3)3SH with Er values between 4 and 9.5%. The inter and intra-day accuracy of oxygenates, thiols and permanent gas presented Er less than 15%. Overall, relatively good performances were obtained for inter-day and intra-day accuracy. This demonstrates that the analytical method is robust, including the use of an averaged calibration curve built from data collected on different days. In routine operation, a restricted number of standards can be analysed to act as quality controls for the analytical session with real samples [55]. New calibration data can be obtained on a regular basis, replacing the old calibration data. Table 4 shows information on the LODs, LOQs and linearity. The values for the LODs were between 0.21 ppm for 1-propanol and 3.60 ppm for 2-butanol. The LODs of less than 0.8 ppm were: acetic acid, methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol. The LOQs varied between 0.20 ppm for 1-butanol and 10.71 ppm for acetone. In terms of linearity, 0.9994 < r2 < 0.9999 was observed, with 2-butanol and tert-butanol showing the least linearity in the group of oxygenates."
10,"Detection of thiols, sulphides and permanent gases","3.3 Detection of thiols, sulphides and permanent gases Fig. 2 shows the qMS chromatogram of 4 thiols, 4 sulphides and 5 permanent gases. In Table 1 the SIM parameters were established for the thiols and sulphides, to guarantee an adequate monitoring of ions, Qualifier and quantifier ions were determined. The analytic strategy employed was the same as that of the first research project [7]. The principal objective of this research was to increase the number of inhibitors affecting the productivity of ZN. For that reason, a gas chromatograph was configured with the MSD detectors and one PDHID. The first MSD was specifically for the oxygenates, the second MSD for sulphides and thiols, and the PDHID for the permanent gases. The second MSD and the PDHID used the methodology previously described, but for the development of this new configuration of the GC, they gave an additional value to the analytic capacity—specifically, in lessening the response times and the need to take preventive and corrective action in the control of the PP production process. In addition, the need to propose a sufficiently robust LRM on an industrial scale, required the quantification of the major inhibitors in the analysis of the same sample, with the same external errors, and knowledge of the real loss in productivity that takes place in the PP polymerization reactor. The thiol and sulfur compounds were: CH3CH2SH, CS2, COS, CH3SH, CH3(CH2)2SH, CH3(CH2)3SH and H2S. The specific identifications of the compounds and their respective concentrations are given in the section describing the research. These species are commonly analyzed from different vantage points, such as the quality of internal air, the environment, the chemical processes and industrial hygiene. The repeatability in the RSD of the thiols in the peak area was less than 0.3 % and their range was from 0.11% for CH3(CH2)2SH – 0.29 % CH3CH2SH. The variation in this range was very narrow. The repeatability in retention times was less that 0.3% and varied between 0.03% for CH3SH - 0.28% for CH3(CH2)2SH. Significantly, the repeatability for the area and time of retention was maintained below 0.3%. The behavior of the intermediate precision in the area was less than 0.68% and its range of variation was 0.34% for CH3(CH2)2SH – 0.67% for CH3CH2SH. For retention time, the reproducibility was below 0.5% and varied between 0.06% for CH3SH y CH3(CH2)3SH - 0.49% for CH3(CH2)2SH. Table 2 shows that the higher repeatability values in area and retention time are approximately 50% of the intermediate precision. These differences indicate that the proposed chromatographic method for sulphides and thiols depends upon external factors such as the competence of the chromatograph operators, the manner in which the standards were injected and human error, among others. Table 4 shows that the values of the LODs were between 0.01 ppm for CH3CH2SH and CH3(CH2)2SH – 0.05 ppm for CH3(CH2)3SH. The LOQs varied between 0.04 ppm for CH3CH2SH and CH3(CH2)2SH – 0.34 ppm for CH3(CH2)3SH. For linearity 0.9953 < r2 < 0.9992 was observed, with the CH3SH and CH3CH2SH being the thiols with the least linearity."
11,Sample analysis,"3.4 Sample analysis Seventy-eight samples of propylene from different points in the PP production process were selected. These included storage tanks, distillation columns, polymerization reactors, propylene transport ships, and propylene in liquid and gas states. The quantitative data for the inhibitors was based upon the calibration curves obtained in the linearity experiments for each of them, shown in Table 4. The samples with concentration values outside the calibration curve were diluted to obtain a value within the range, and subsequently the dilution factor was used to determine the real concentration values of the sample. Fig. 3 (a) shows that the inhibitors detected and quantified were: formic acid (0.5 to 90 ppm), acetic acid (1.0 to 98 ppm), acetone (0.4 to 140 ppm), methanol (0.01 to 90 ppm), isopropyl alcohol (0.01 to 70 ppm), ethanol (0.01 to 72 ppm), 1-propanol (0.01 to 60 ppm), 1-butanol (0.01 to 72 ppm), 2-butanol (0.01 to 77 ppm), tert-butanol (1.0 to 82 ppm), CH3SH (0.12 to 12.51 ppm), CH3CH2SH (1.11 to 37 ppm), CH3(CH2)2SH (1.15 to 24 ppm), CH3(CH2)3SH (2.1 to 23 ppm), H2S (0.1 to 1.8 ppm), COS (0.012 to 0.06 ppm), CS2 (0.04 to 0.22 ppm), CO (0.003 to 0.016 ppm), CO2 (0.2 to 12 ppm) and O2 (0.1 to 20 ppm). This indicates that there is a 95% reliability that the concentrations calculated are found within the ranges shown. The oxygenated compounds showed the greatest ranges in variation, followed by the thiols, the permanent gases and, finally, the sulphides with the narrowest ranges. Fig. 3(b) shows that the productivity values of the catalyst range between 36.0 and 45.0 kilograms/metric tons (Kg/TM). Seventy per cent of the propylene samples analyzed generated a loss in productivity in ZN catalyst between 5 and 20%. A value of 20% loss in productivity is extremely high and will be generated each time the propylene has one of these impurities: acetone (140 ppm), methanol (90 ppm), isopropyl alcohol (70 ppm), ethanol (72 ppm), 1-propanol (60 ppm), CO (0.016 ppm), CO2 (12 ppm), H2S (1.8 ppm), COS (0.05 ppm), CS2 (0.22 ppm) CH3SH (25 ppm), CH3CH2SH (37 ppm), CH3(CH2)2SH (24 ppm), CH3(CH2)3SH (23 ppm) and O2 (20 ppm). Only 19% of the 78 samples had no effect upon productivity. These results show the importance of the developed method for the producers of PP on an industrial scale. The components appearing with greatest frequency in each sample family were: formic acid, acetic acid, acetone, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, CH3CH2SH, CS2, COS, CH3SH, CH3(CH2)2SH, CH3(CH2)3SH and H2S, CO, CO2 and O2."
12,Analysis of multiple linear regression (MLR),"3.5 Analysis of multiple linear regression (MLR) An MLR model was developed to predict the loss in productivity of the ZN catalyst using 20 inhibitors as descriptors which were quantified using the chromatographic method previously described. The MLR specifications are summarized in Table 5 . The MLR was developed using Minitab software, V. 18. The statistics for the analysis of the coefficients: coefficients (coef), standard error for coefficients (SE of the coef), critical vale (T value), P value and inflation of variance factor (IVF) for the model are also given in this table. Since the p value of each term evaluates the null hypothesis in which the coefficient is equal to zero (without effect), then the values of p < 0.05 in the analysis of the coefficients, indicate that the null hypothesis can be rejected. It is probable that all of the predictors or inhibitors have an additional significance for the model, and that the changes in the value of the predictor will be related to changes in the productivity of the ZN catalyst. The test results for model validation are given in summary form: (1) The graphical method represented no pattern between the predicted values and residuals, as shown in Fig. 4 (a); (2) The average value of the residuals from this model is zero, and the standardized distribution of residuals is close to normal in distribution, as shown in the Q–Q plot in Fig. 4(b); (3) The model is free from autocorrelation on the basis of the Durbin–Watson d statistic (1.87); and, (4) The model can be regarded as not having a multicollinearity problem since the result of the VIF is less than 1.1. The 20 predictors of interest showed negative values, and 16 of them showed results of less than 0.8. The 4 remaining predictors: CO, H2S, COS and CS2, show coefficients of -653.8, -5.574, -203.5 and -46.05 respectively. This indicates that these compounds are the greatest inhibitors of the productivity of the ZN catalyst and, especially CO and COS which, with trace or ultra-trace concentrations, generate very significant losses in the efficiency of PP production on an industrial scale. The model predicts that with the simultaneous presence of 0.01 ppm of each of these 4 compounds, a loss in productivity of approximately 20% is generated. The model also indicates that the oxygenated compounds only generate significant effects in the loss in productivity when they are found in concentrations greater than 20 ppm, whereas the thiols ranging from 7 to 25 ppm affect productivity between 5 and 20%. The F value oscillates between 9.74 and 169.45. The sulphides, thiols, ketones, permanent gases, alcohols (excluding 2-butanol, 1-butanol and tert-butanol) showed values greater than 125, indicating that all the terms included in the model are associated with the loss in productivity of the ZN catalyst. The standard errors are low, which indicates the suitability and generality of the descriptors. The signs of all the coefficients are negative, indicating that whenever these parameters increase, the loss in productivity is greater. The multiple correlation coefficient was 0.9092 with a standard deviation of 1.12, permitting the achievement of acceptable linearity when comparing the experimental values to those predicted. Fig. 5 compared the performance of the prediction of MLR with the experimental value of productivity of ZN catalyst. This shows an R2 of 0.9859 and a standard deviation of 0.39, indicating normality This model permits foreseeing and mitigating losses since, with the application of the GC method developed in this research, the traces of the 20 inhibitors present in the propylene can be quantified and the percentage of losses generated can be calculated if this particular propylene is to be used. The losses of millions of dollars can be mitigated, by identifying the broad characterization of the inhibitors in the propylene. Timely actions can be taken such as designing traps to remove the traces. Mixing propylene high in ppm inhibitors with propylene of higher purity, will provide dilution factors which produce a propylene with the lowest possible ppm inhibitors. The method employed in this research can be applied to save production time, person-hours and material. In addition to improving the productivity of polypropylene production, it has applicability to the oil industry, standards development, quality control and machinery life span, extending its utility far beyond the scope of its present uses. For the producers of PP worldwide, this research contributes to a solution of problems of financial loss. Its findings can assist in eliminating low rates of PP production which consume a large quantity of propylene, as well as the need for frequent cleaning of the reactor because of loss of PP fluidity. Large masses of PP, as solid as steel, form within the reactor and stop it, necessitating its removal from service for at least a week to perform the required maintenance. This method is of great assistance in the control of the propylene quality before it leaves the ships that transport it. It is also valuable for determining improvements strategies promoting removal of impurities, producing propylene of improved quality with fewer aggressive effects for ZN catalyst. In addition, this method permits the evaluation of the efficiency of the columns that remove inhibitors. In petrochemical plants inhibitors in productivity of the ZN catalysts are never desirable. For this reason these plants have installed adsorption or absorption columns of medium, low and high polarity. It is assumed that, if these inhibitors come with the propylene, they will be retained and will not affect the operation of the process. It can be observed that this is a deficient process control since it is basically very subjective and depends on the final effect of the polymerization reaction. The method developed in this research provides greater assistance since it permits an efficient control of the process and an efficient operation of the adsorption and absorption columns. The columns are sampled every 8 hours at the entrance, exit and during the venting of gases. With one sample from these three points, the efficiency of their operation is determined."
13,Conclusions,"Inhibitors detected and quantified using GC-PDHID / MSD / MSD with 8 columns, 7 valves and 3 detectors were formic acid, acetic acid, acetone, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, CO, CO2, O2, H2S, COS, CS2, CH3SH, CH3CH2SH, CH3(CH2)2SH, and CH3(CH2)3SH. The productivity values of the catalyst ranged between 36.0 and 45.0 Kg/TM, producing losses between 5 and 20% in PP production. This currently represents losses of several million dollars. Therefore, a model was developed to predict these losses in the reaction, based upon the effect of inhibitors. The model complied with the normal distribution of residuals, homoscedasticity, non-autocorrelation and multi-co-linearity. The method employed in this research can be applied to save production time, person-hours and material. In addition to improving the productivity of polypropylene production, it has applicability to the oil industry, standards development, quality control and machinery life span, extending its utility far beyond the scope of its present uses."
