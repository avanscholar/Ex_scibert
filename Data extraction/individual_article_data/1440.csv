0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an attractive energy carrier, due to its potentially high energy efficiency and zero generation of pollutant. It can be used as fuel for direct combustion in an internal combustion engine, gas power turbine and fuel cell, and it is also an important raw material to produce synthetic chemicals [1]. More than 90% hydrogen is produced by the traditional steam methane reforming [1]. The multiple steps with high capital investment and significant CO2 emissions are the main drawbacks of this technology [1]. Recently, hydrogen production derived from chemical looping technology has attracted a great deal of concern attributed to the high process efficiency, lower thermal energy demand and inherent capture of CO2 [2–5]. In generally, hydrogen production can be summarized into two categories in chemical looping, including chemical looping reforming/gasification and chemical looping water splitting (CLWS) [2,6]. In chemical looping reforming (CLR) or chemical looping gasification (CLG), fuel is partially oxidized by oxygen carrier (OC) to produce the syngas in FR, the reduced oxygen carrier is regenerated by air, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). However, in order to obtain high purity hydrogen, additional water gas shift and pressure swing adsorption units are required. In CLWS process, pure and isolated H2 and CO2 can be produced just using condensing the gas streams for separation [4], as shown in Fig. 1(b). Fuel is completely oxidized by the OC in FR to capture high concentration CO2, and then the reduced OC is oxidized by steam in steam reactor (SR) to produce the high purity hydrogen. No additional separation equipment is required, avoiding the complicated and expensive multistep separation processes and saving the operation cost. Fe2O3 considered to be the most suitable metal oxide in the CLWS process [3,7,8]. Due to the limitation of thermodynamic property and low redox activity of iron oxides, the three-reactor system, is proposed by adding an air reactor (AR) to oxidize Fe3O4 to Fe2O3 in order to increase the oxygen transfer capacity and reduce energy consumption [4,9,10]. This work is devoted to produce and high purity hydrogen and syngas by a combined technique of chemical looping reforming and water splitting process (CLRWS) using Fe-based OCs, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). In CLRWS, the fuel is partially oxidized into syngas (CO and H2) in FR, high purity hydrogen is produced in SR, and OC is regenerated in AR. Compared with the traditional CLR or CLWS, the advantage of CLRWS is the syngas and high purity hydrogen can be produced simultaneously, but it no longer has the ability to internally separate CO2. This disadvantage could be circumvented by using carbon–neutral biomass-based fuel in CLRWS to achieve zero carbon emission. Bio-oil, as one of biomass-based fuel, could be produced from the thermo-chemical conversion processes, such as pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction. Bio-oil is a complex mixture of several hundreds of organic compounds like acids, alcohols, aldehydes, phenols, and oligomers, etc., which difficult to use directly due to low heating value, high acidity and chemical instability [11]. Heteroatoms removal by hydrotreating is a typical way for bio-oil utilization [12]. Recently, the carbon–neutral bio-oil has been widely used in CLR and CLWS [13–16]. Therefore, CLRWS with bio-oil has a good development prospect for high purity hydrogen and syngas, not only avoids the problem of CO2 emission, but also realizes the high value utilization. A proper OC in the CLRWS needs to have sufficiently high selectivity with bio-oil to produce syngas, good performance for water splitting to produce hydrogen, high resistance carbon deposition and high sintering resistance during redox cycles. Ni-based OCs have been widely used in CLR reforming due to high selectivity of syngas and excellent catalytic performance [17–21]. It seems to be an ideal way to breakthrough to use Ni-Fe bimetallic OCs in CLRWS process. Compared with the Fe-based OCs, Ni-Fe bimetallic OCs were proved to increase carrier reactivity, improve the fuel conversion, and maintain the mechanical properties in chemical looping processes [22,23]. Luo et al. [24] reported that the addition of nickel with the mole fraction of ~ 3%, Fe-based OCs exhibited the best capability of oxygen transfer and the highest yields of hydrogen (11.79 mmol/g per cycle) and syngas in the glycerol reforming coupled water splitting process. Plou and Herrer et al. [25–27]reported that the presence of Ni enhanced the catalytic reactivity and promoted the deep reduction of Fe3O4 to Fe, but the deactivation of the catalysts was observed due to carbon deposition and thermal sintering. Takenaka et al. [28] modified iron oxide with both Ni and Cr species. They proved the addition of Ni to iron oxides enhanced the reduction with methane and the subsequent oxidation with water vapor at low temperatures, but they also met the sintering of iron problem promoted by Ni species. Although, Ni-Fe bimetallic OCs have exhibited inspiring performance in chemical looping processes, its resistance to carbon deposition and sintering still need to be further improved. Inert supports, such as Al2O3, CeO2, La2O3, MgO, TiO2 and ZrO2, are widely used to enhance reaction reactivity, mechanical stability, catalytic activity and carbon deposition of Ni-based, Fe-based and Ni-Fe bimetallic materials in steam reforming and chemical looping processes [2,3,17,29–32]. Different supports have different functions in the chemical looping process. The presence of support effect the OC surface acidity and basicity that would be helpful in inhibiting the carbon deposition. Moreover, the dispersion of active components, the anti-sintering ability, and the reduction performance and catalytic performance, oxygen mobility and interaction with Fe/Ni will be influenced by adding the supports. Kierzkowska et al. [33] reported that the sintering of Fe2O3 effectively alleviated using Al2O3 as the support, but the formation of FeAl2O4 decreased the hydrogen yield. Zhu et al. [34] found that the addition of CeO2 decreased the reaction temperature of steam-iron process. Miller et al. [35]also reported that the addition of CeO2 enhanced the reducibility of Fe2O3 due to the Ce–Fe interaction. Chen et al. [36] found that Fe2O3 supported on Al2O3 showed better hydrogen production performance than supported on TiO2 owing to more porous structure and higher surface area of Al2O3. Liu et al. [37]got the stable hydrogen yield of 90% over 20 cycles without significant deterioration of the reaction kinetics in CLWS using ZrO2 as an inert support. It was reported that the NixMgyO solid solutions showed high resistance ability for carbon deposition due to its ability to activate CO2 [38]. When La2O3 was used as support, the formation of LaFeO3 exhibited high syngas selectivity, and structural stability [39,40]. In this study, six different materials were selected as supports to prepare the Ni-Fe Ni-Fe bimetallic OCs, The NiO and Fe2O3 supported on Al2O3, CeO2, La2O3, MgO, TiO2 and ZrO2 are collectively called NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm (A = Al, Ce, La, Mg, Ti and Zr), termed as NFA, NFC, NFL, NFM, NFT and NFZ, respectively. The operation parameters were optimized using Aspen Plus software for process simulation. The performance of NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm in the CLRWS process were evaluated on the lab-scaled fixed bed experiment system, and the fresh and used OCs were characterized with a series of characterization technologies to clarify the relationship and roles of the inert supports and Ni-Fe bimetallic active components."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Process simulation,"2.1 Process simulation A mixture of cresol, acetic acid and ethanol with mass ratio of 2:1:1 was used as bio-oil model compound. Aspen Plus software (Version 11) was used to simulate the CLRWS process to select the suitable parameters for the fixed-bed tests. In process simulation, Fe2O3 and bio-oil model compound were used as OC and fuel, respectively. The ASPEN Plus flowsheet for the CLRWS process is shown in Fig. 2 . The fuel (FUEL stream) reacted with OC (OC stream) in fuel reactor (FR block). The products (FR-OUT stream) were separated by a separator (FR-C block). The gaseous products (SYNHOT stream) was cooled via a heat changer (H-SYN block) to obtain syngas (SYN stream). The solid products (FR-SOLID stream) was transported into steam reactor and reacted with steam (STEAM stream), which was produced by heating water (WATER stream) using a heat changer (H-WATER block). Similarly, the products (SR-OUT stream) were separated by the separator (SR-C block). High concentration hydrogen (H2 stream) was obtained by a heat exchanger (H-H2 block) after the gaseous product (H2HOT stream) cooled. The solid product (SR-SOLID stream) was transported and regenerated in air reactor (AR block) using air (AIR stream) as oxidizing agent. The products (AR-OUT stream) were separated by a separator (AR-C block). The waste heat of high temperature flue (FLUEHOT stream) was recovered discharged (FLUE stream) by a heat exchanger (H-AIR block). The regenerated OC (OC stream) was introduced into FR to start a new cycle. The main parameters and possible components in simulation process are listed in Table 1 . The system was operated the under isothermal and isobaric conditions. The thermodynamic properties were determined based on the SOLIDS property method using the vapor phase in the Redlich-Kwong-Soave equation of state with Boston-Mathias modification [41,42]. The FR, SR and AR reactors were simulated by the built-in RGibbs modules. The calculation of the chemical and phase equilibrium was based on the theory of Gibbs free energy minimizing. Gas–solid separators were used to separate solid OCs from gas phase, simulated by the SSplit model. Heat changers were used for heating or cooling the streams to the desired temperature, simulated by the Heater model. The assumptions of the process simulation are shown as follows: (1) the kinetic effects were not taken into consideration. (2) the shape and properties of the solids were disregarded. (3) the pressure drop and heat lost between units during the operation were neglected. (4) the catalytic activity of OC was not considered."
3,The preparation of oxygen carriers,"2.2 The preparation of oxygen carriers The NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm (A = Al, Ce, La, Mg, Ti and Zr) OCs were prepared by the impregnation method. The mass fractions of NiO, Fe2O3 and supports (AnOm) were 5 wt%, 60 wt% and 35 wt%, respectively. At first, the Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in the deionized water to obtain the nitrate solution. Then, the nitrate solution was added in beakers, where loaded the Al2O3, CeO2, La2O3, MgO, TiO2 and ZrO2 powder, and ultrasonic treatment for 1 h. The suspension was mixed with the vigorous stirring in 90 °C water bath for 12 h. The obtained precursor was dried at 105 °C for 24 h, calcined at 900 °C for 5 h. Finally, the sample was cooled, crushed and sieved into 100–300 μm for use."
4,Fixed bed tests,"2.3 Fixed bed tests The CLRWS experiments were conducted in a fixed bed reaction system, as shown in Fig. 3 . This system was consisted of a feeder, a set of carrier gas unit, a fixed bed reactor, a condenser and an on-line gas analyzer. A quartz tube (i.d. = 26 mm, length = 1,000 mm) was used as the fixed bed reactor, with a porous distributor placed in the reactor 400 mm from the bottom. The reactor temperature was measured by a K-type thermocouple. The CLRWS experiments can be divided into three stages: partial oxidation and catalytic reforming for syngas production in FR (stage 1), water splitting for hydrogen production in SR (stage 2) and regeneration of OCs in AR (stage 3). In the stage 1, OC was placed in the porous distributor and heated in air atmosphere (20.8%/79.2%, v/v, 500 mL/min). When the temperature achieved, air was switched to N2 atmosphere (99.9%, 500 mL/min). The bio-oil model compound was injected into the fixed-bed reactor using an injection pump. The reactions deemed complete when the combustible gases weren’t detected in the outlet. In the stage 2, water was injected to the fixed bed reactor with a flow rate of 0.20 mL/min until no hydrogen was detected in the outlet. In the stage 3, N2 was switched to air (20.8%/79.2% v/v 500 mL/min) for the OC regeneration for 30 min. The gas production passed through a condenser to remove the condensable components. The non-condensable gases were measured via on-line gas analyzer. Each experiment was repeated three times to ensure the repeatability of the process."
5,Characterization technologies,"2.4 Characterization technologies X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fresh and used OCs were collected on a PW3040/60×’Pert PRO (PANnalytical) diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (0.15432 nm) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The surface morphology of OCs was investigated using Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM, FEI Quanta 200). The specific surface areas, average pore diameter and total pore volume were measured on Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus with adsorption–desorption isotherms recorded at 77 K. The reduction characteristics of OCs were measured by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments (PCA-1200, China). The OCs were heated in hydrogen (10/90 H2/Ar v/v%, 100 mL/min) from room temperature to 1,000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Raman spectra (LabRAM, HR800, Horiba JobinYvon) was adopted to identify the types of carbon deposited on the reduced OCs. The spectra equipped with a 532 nm wavelength laser, took from 1,000 to 2,000 cm−1, the signal collection time was set as 15 s, and each sample was analyzed more than two times to generate the final spectrum. The position and height of the D and G bands were obtained by fitting with Gaussian/Lorentzian peaks."
6,Data analysis,"2.5 Data analysis The main gas products in FR are CO2, CO, CH4 and H2, whereas the main gas products are CO2, CO and H2 in SR. Knowing that the flowrate of the N2 carrier gas is a constant, viz. 500 mL/min, the outlet gas flow rate (fout , mol/s) is calculated as: (1) f out = f N 2 1 - ∑ x i where xi represents the gas concentration of the gas components (i = CO2, CO, CH4, H2, and O2). The time-averaged mole fraction (Xi , vol%) of species i over the entire duration of the bio-oil reforming stage is estimated by: (2) X i = ∫ t 1 t 2 f out x i d t ∫ t 1 t 2 f out ∑ x i d t × 100 % Gas yields in FR (YG-FR , Nm3/kg) and SR (YG-SR , Nm3/kg) are defined as the volume of gases produced by 1 kg bio-oil in FR and SR, respectively: (3) Y G - F R = 22.4 ∫ t 1 t 2 f out ∑ x i d t m bio - o i l (4) Y G - S R = 22.4 ∫ t 3 t 4 f out ∑ x i d t m bio - o i l where mbio-oil (g) is the mass fuel in each run, t1 and t2 represent the start time and end time of the reforming stage in FR, respectively. t3 and t4 represent the start time and end time of the hydrogen production stage in SR, respectively. The syngas purity (Psyn , %) is the volume fraction of syngas (CO and H2) in gas production in FR. It is calculated as follows: (5) P syn = ∫ t 1 t 2 f out ( x CO + x H 2 ) d t ∫ t 1 t 2 f out ∑ x i d t × 100 % The hydrogen purity ( P H , %) is the volume fraction of hydrogen in gas production in SR. It is calculated as follows: (6) P H = ∫ t 3 t 4 f out x H 2 d t ∫ t 3 t 4 f out ∑ x i d t × 100 % The carbon element in bio-oil was convert into gaseous, liquid and solid products. The percentage of carbon element in gaseous products, η GC(%), is calculated as follows: (7) η GC = ∫ t 1 t 2 f out ( x CO + x C O 2 + x CH 4 ) d t Mc × 100 % where MC is the molar amount of carbon in bio-oil in each run. In the study, MC equal 0.0928 mol. The percentage of carbon element in solid products, η SC(%), is calculated as follows: (8) η SC = ∫ t 3 t 4 f out ( x CO + x C O 2 + x CH 4 ) d t Mc × 100 % The percentage of carbon element in liquid products, η LC(%), is calculated as follows: (9) η LC = 1 - η GC - η SC We defined the mass ratio of fuel to Fe2O3 (F/O) as a variable to evaluate the CLRWS process. Bio-oil model compound and Fe2O3 were used as fuel and oxygen carrier in the process simulation, respectively. Therefore, the F/O in this study is calculated as follows: (10) F / O = M a s s o f b i o - o i l m o d e l c o m p o u n d M a s s o f F e 2 O 3 i n o x y g e n c a r r i e r"
7,Results,
8,Optimization of operation parameters in process simulation,"3.1 Optimization of operation parameters in process simulation The effects of FR temperature and F/O ratio on the gas yield in FR (YG-FR ) and SR (YG-SR ), the syngas purity in FR (Psyn ) and the state of Fe element are presented in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), when F/O was less than 0.3, the effects of F/O on YG-FR and Psyn could be negligible. The YG-FR decreased slightly with the increasing temperature, while Psyn presented an opposite tendency. When F/O was higher than 0.3, the YG-FR and Psyn increased significantly with the increasing F/O. It was found that the FR temperature exhibited little influence on the reduction of Fe2O3 at the same F/O, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Fe2O3 was mainly reduced to Fe and FeO with the lower F/O values. The Fe2O3 was completely reduced to metallic Fe when the F/O closed to 0.3. The reduction of the Fe-based OCs to Fe0 was more beneficial to the generation of hydrogen than reduction to FeO, so the hydrogen yield increased with the increasing F/O. When F/O < 0.3, the Fe2O3 could be completely reduced. Therefore, further increasing the F/O leaded to a decrease in YG-SR . The H2 purity (P H) achieved 100% (not given) in the above temperature and F/O study ranges. In general, the mass ratio of F/O = 0.3 was suitable for coproduction of hydrogen and syngas in the CLRWS process. In order to ensure a reasonable reaction rate, the reaction temperature was set at 900 °C in the following fixed-bed experiments."
9,Evaluation performance of different OCs in CLRWS process,"3.2 Evaluation performance of different OCs in CLRWS process The CLRWS experiments were carried out in a fixed bed reactor with the different OCs at 900 °C with F/O of 0.3. For comparison, both Fe2O3 and the mixture of NiO and Fe2O3 without support (termed as Ni-Fe) OCs in fixed bed tests. In each run, NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm of 10 g and bio-oil model compound of 1.8 g were used to maintain the F/O of 0.3. The total feeding time of bio-oil model compound was 20 min. Fig. 5 (a) shows the variation tendency of gas composition in the first cycle using NFC as OC. There was an obvious CO2 peak in FR at the initial reaction stage, due to the fact that the lattice oxygen derived from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 was beneficial to the complete oxidation of fuel to CO2 and H2O. The lattice oxygen was gradually consumed along with the reaction, therefore, the concentration of CO2 decreased but the concentration of reductive gases (CO, H2 and CH4) increased gradually. In SR, the main gas product was H2 owe to the reaction between Fe/FeO with steam. Additionally, two peaks of CO and CO2 were observed, attributed to the carbon deposition in FR transported into SR then reacted with steam. In AR, no carbonaceous gas was detected during the regeneration process of OCs, indicating the carbon deposition was completely eliminated in SR. From the Fig. 5(b), the Fe2O3 exhibited the highest value of ηLC (57.57 wt%), meaning most bio-oil did not be converted in FR. The ηLC decreased significantly to 27.92 wt%, when NiO-Fe2O3 was used as OC, attributed to the excellent catalytic performance of Ni in reforming of hydrocarbons. After modifying the supports and introducing the NiO, the ηLC decreased sharply but the ηGC increased significantly for the NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm OCs. The ηGC of NFC (75.07%), NFL (70.19%) and NFZ (67.95%) were higher among six OCs. It indicated that the supports, CeO2, La2O3 and ZrO2, behaved the better reaction reactivity and catalytic activity. ηSC reflected the carbon deposition of OCs in FR. ηSC (8.89%) was the lowest one for the Fe2O3, meaning the presence of the NiO and supports results more serious carbon deposition. The amount of carbon deposition decreased as follow: NFM > NFT > NFZ > NFA > NFL > NFC. As shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), when Fe2O3 was used as OC, the gas yield in FR and SR were 0.465 Nm3/kg and 0.558 Nm3/kg, respectively. These values were much lower than that for the modified OCs, indicating the introduction of NiO and supports improved significantly the reaction reactivity of Fe2O3. The NFL exhibited the highest Psyn (84.12%) and YG-FR (1.348 Nm3/kg) in FR (Fig. 5c). Although NFA and NFM presented higher Psyn , 78.44% and 77.23%, respectively, the YG-FR of them, 1.006 Nm3/kg and 1.107 Nm3/kg, were relatively lower compared with NFC, NFT and NFZ. The NFZ exhibited the highest YG-SR (1.283 Nm3/kg) in SR, followed by NFC (1.255 Nm3/kg) and NFL (1.191 Nm3/kg). However, PH in SR decreased as the following order: NFC (91.66%) > NFZ (86.24%) > NFL (85.73%). Compared with NFC, NFZ and NFL, the NFA, NFM and NFT exhibited the weaker performance in CLRWS. PH of NFA, NFM and NFT in SR were 84.69%, 78.93% and 79.48%, the corresponding YG-SR were 0.851, 1.081 and 0.917 Nm3/kg, respectively."
10,The effect of steam in FR,"3.3 The effect of steam in FR In general, the addition of NiO and supports increased the catalytic activity and reaction reactivity, but also aggravated the carbon deposition in FR. It was noted that the highest hydrogen yield was only 91.66% in SR for NFC. This value was relatively lower compared with traditional CLWS process. In order to elevate the hydrogen purity in SR, the steam and bio-oil model compound were co-feeding in FR. The low steam amount cannot be effectively removed carbon in FR, but excess steam decreased the hydrogen yield. We need to find a compromise between the hydrogen yield and the purity to pursue high system efficiency [15]. Based on the preliminary experimental results, a molar ratio of steam to carbon (S/C) in bio-oil model compound was fixed at 1.4. The reaction temperature and F/O value were unchanged with the experiments in section 3.2. As shown in Fig. 6 , the values of YG-FR in FR increased remarkable when the steam was added in FR. The NFA and NFZ obtained the maximum and minimum YG-FR , 1.714 Nm3/kg and 1.417 Nm3/kg, respectively. The NFT exhibited the highest Psyn of 86.93%. The values of Psyn of NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm OCs were above 80%. In SR, the PH of all NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm OCs in SR were over 95%. The PH decreased followed by the order: NFZ (99.73%) > NFC (99.66%) > NFL (98.54%) > NFM (96.79%) > NFT (95.61%) > NFA (95.45%). It was noted that YG-SR decreased when the steam was added into FR. The YG-SR for the NFA, NFC, NFL, NFM, MFT and NFZ were 0.782, 1.165, 1.087, 0.865 and 0.638 and 1.132 Nm3/kg, respectively. Compared with NFC, NFL and NFZ, the reduction of YG-SR for NFA, NFM and NFT were more obvious. In general, adding steam in the fuel reactor was an efficiency way to enhance the hydrogen purity. Different inert supports have different performance in CLRWS. Taking both the performance of NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm in the FR and SR into consideration, the NFL, NFZ and NFC exhibited better performance than the other three OCs for the syngas and hydrogen coproduction."
11,Multiple cycle tests,"3.4 Multiple cycle tests Total 10 cyclic CLRWS experiments were performed in the fixed bed reactor to evaluate the stability of NFC, NFL and NFZ OCs. The reaction temperature at 900 °C, F/O of 0.3, and S/C of 1.4. As shown in Fig. 7 , the NFC presented higher YG-SR (1.158 Nm3/kg) and PH (99.29%) in the 10th cycle, indicating the excellent stability during 10 cycles. As for NFL, both YG-SR and PH decreased slightly from 1.087 Nm3/kg and 98.54% in the first cycle to 1.026 Nm3/kg and 95.72% in the 10th cycle, respectively. The NFZ had a good cyclic performance in the first five cycles. The YG-SR and PH for NFZ in the 5th cycle was 1.137 Nm3/kg and 98.28%, respectively. However, the YG-SR increased to 1.232 Nm3/kg but the PH decreased sharply to 90.11% at the 10th cycle for NFZ. It could be concluded that the cycle stability decreased as the followed order: NFC > NFL > NFZ."
12,Characterization of oxygen carriers,"3.5 Characterization of oxygen carriers 3.5.1 The oxygen transfer capacity The OCs were heated from room temperature to 900 °C in TGA under air atmosphere. The TGA reactor was purged by nitrogen until the desired temperature achieved. Then hydrogen (5.0 vol%, nitrogen balance) was introduced into the TGA reactor to reduce the OCs for 40 min. After that, the reduced OCs were oxidized by air (20.8 vol%, nitrogen balance). The TGA curves are presented in Fig. 8 . The weight of NFA, NFC, NFL, NFM, NFT and NFZ decreased to 88.31%, 85.88%, 87.76%, 88.34%, 89.77% and 85.24%, the corresponding oxygen transfer capacity (ROC ) were 0.1169, 0.1412, 0.1224, 0.1166, 0.1023 and 0.1476%, respectively. When the NiO and Fe2O3 were reduced to metallic Ni and Fe, the theoretical ROC of NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm is 0.1906, much higher than the actual values of ROC . On the one hand, it was mainly due to the interaction between the active components and supports decreased the ROC of OCs; on the other hand, it may result from part of the active components lost during the preparation process. 3.5.2 XRD The XRD patterns of OCs are shown in Fig. 9 . NiFe2O4 can be observed in all the fresh OCs except NFA. Compared with the pure Fe2O3, NiFe2O4 was more suitable for hydrogen production because the strong oxidation performance promotes the deep reduction of Fe-based OC in a relatively short reaction time [43,44]. That was why the modified OCs had the better coproduction of hydrogen in the CLRWS process. The supports reacted with the active components (NiO or Fe2O3) and formed NiAl2O4, LaFeO3, MgFe2O4 and Fe2TiO5 in the fresh NFA, NFL, NFM and NFT, respectively. After reduced by the fuel, the detection of Fe-based oxides, namely FeAl2O4, CeFeO3, FeTiO3, LaFeO3 and MgFe2O4, in the NFA, NFC, NFT, NFL and NFM, illustrated that the inert supports hindered the deep reduction of iron oxide. From the view of the H2 production, this was disadvantageous because it reduced the hydrogen yield in SR. In the reduced OCs, nickel element mainly existed in the form of (Fe, Ni) alloy and/or metallic Ni, which is well known to catalyze decomposition of hydrocarbons. However, NiAl2O4 in NFA was not reduced into metallic Ni, resulted in a decrease in catalytic performance and lattice oxygen. In SR, both Fe and (Fe, Ni) alloy were oxidized by the steam into Fe3O4 to produce high purity hydrogen. The metallic Ni maintained in NFC, NFM, NFT and NFZ after steam oxidation due to the thermodynamic limitation. The Ni species were not observed in the NFL sample after the steam oxidation. It may be due to the Ni evaporated at high temperature, or the Ni transferred to the interior of the particles during the reaction process, which hindered the detection of Ni. The FeAl2O4, CeFeO3 and FeTiO3 were maintained in NFA, NFC and NFT samples after steam oxidation in SR, indicated that the presence of them was unfavorable for the hydrogen production by steam oxidation. 3.5.3 H2-TPR As shown in the Fig. 10 , the fresh NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm OCs could be reduced when the temperature increased to 300 °C (line 1), the peaks at ca. 490 °C (line 2), 620 °C (line 3) and 700 °C (line 4) were assigned to the reduction of Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and FeO, respectively. The H2 consumption peaks at ca. 800 °C (line 5) and 950 °C (line 6) were attributed to the reduction of NiAl2O4 and FeAl2O4 for NFA [33]. The H2-TPR profiles of fresh NFC and NFL samples were similar between 700 °C and 900 °C, it was attributed to the reduction of perovskite, namely CeFeO3 and LaFeO3. Obviously, NFL was more difficult to reduce than NFC. The initial reduction temperatures of NFT and NFM were higher than that of the other OCs. It was attributed to the Fe2O3 reacted with the supports and formed Fe2TiO5 and MgFe2O4. For the NFT, the peaks around at ca. 800 °C and 900 °C (line 6) were attributed to the reduction of Fe2TiO5 and FeTiO3. Higher H2 consumption was presented for NFT, NFM and NFA samples at 1,000 °C, indicating they were difficult to reduce to metallic Fe. On the contrary, there was a lower H2 consumption above 800 °C for NFZ, indicating that Fe3+ in NFZ was easier to reduce into Fe0, which was consistent with the TGA results. 3.5.4 Raman spectra The type of carbon species on the reduced OCs in FR without the presence of steam was identified by the Raman spectroscopy technology. The Raman spectra in the range 1,000–2,000 cm−1 are presented in the Fig. 11 . Two peaks were observed at about 1,350 cm−1 (D band) and 1,590 cm−1 (G band), attributed to the vibrations of carbon atoms in the disordered aromatic structures (D) and highly ordered graphite (G), respectively. According to Tuinstra and Koenig’s law, the disorder degree of carbon species could be quantified using the micro crystalline planar size (La), which could be calculated as follows [38]: La (nm) = 4.4 × IG /ID where IG and ID are the peak heights of the D-band and G-band in Fig. 11, respectively. A higher La represented higher ordered carbon species, which had more difficulty to remove compared with the disordered carbon[38]. The values of La were 8.184, 8.052, 8.536, 9.064, 9.240 and 6.292 nm for NFA, NFC, NFL, NFM, NFT and NFZ in the CLRWS processes, respectively. The order degree of carbon species on the surface of OCs increased as the follows: NFZ < NFC < NFL < NFA < NFM < NFT. It was noted that the higher ROC of oxygen carrier, the lower La value was presented. It was inferred that the OC with higher ROC was easier to release lattice oxygen, which was conducive to suppress carbon deposition, thus reducing the order degree of carbon. 3.5.5 Specific surface area analysis The specific surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter of OCs samples were measured and listed in Table 2 . The NFL exhibited the highest specific surface area (8.331 m2/g) and total pore volume (0.0570 cm3/g) and the lowest average pore diameter (19.890 nm), indicating that NFL had the best porosity among the fresh OCs. In general, the specific surface areas of all the fresh OCs were relatively low, closed to that of natural materials [15,45,46], which was not favorable to the gas diffusion. The lower porosity was attributed to that the OCs were calcinated at high temperature for a long time. Similar results could be observed in the follow literatures [37,47,48]. Based on the fixed-bed test results, the difference in the specific surface areas seemed to have a significant effect on the reactivity of OCs. For example, the specific surface area of NFT (6.138 m2/g) was higher than that of NFC (2.183 m2/g) and NFZ (3.756 m2/g), but the gas yield in FR and hydrogen yield in SR of NFT were lower than that of NFC and NFZ. The NFM exhibited the lowest specific surface area (1.579 m2/g) among of all the OCs. After 10 cycles, the specific surface area of NFC, NFL and NFZ decreased to 1.824, 5.851 and 1.231 m2/g, respectively, the corresponding total pore volume decreased, while the average pore diameter increased. Compared with the fresh OCs, the specific surface areas of NFC, NFL and NFZ reduced by 16.44%, 29.77% and 67.23% after 10 cycles, respectively. Combined with the results of the fixed bed experiments, it was inferred that three OCs presented the varying degree of sintering in the cyclic tests. The specific surface area of NFZ reduction was the highest, meaning the most serious sintering happened for the NFZ. This could be applied to explain why the hydrogen yield of NFZ decreased rapidly in the cyclic tests. 3.5.6 Esem The images of surface morphology of fresh OCs are presented in the Fig. 12 . The fresh NFA, NFC and NFM presented the dense, compact and almost nonporous appearance. Some flocculus dispersed on the surface of NFA and NFM. Unlike NFA and NFM, roughed surface and some flocculus were observed on NFC. The particle size on the surface of fresh NFL was uniform, and more small pores were observed. The surface morphology of fresh NFT was similar to the fresh NFL, but some areas of NFT were smoother with the presence of crackles, and the porosity was lower. The uniformity of particle size also decreased compared with NFL. Many particles covered on the surface of NFZ with larger diameter compared with the other OCs. After 10 cycles, the images of NFC, NFL and NFZ OCs are presented in Fig. 13 . NFC maintained the relatively smooth and compact surface. A small number of fine particles adhered to the surface of NFC. The surface structure of NFC almost remained unchanged during 10 cyclic tests. For the NFL, the uniform small porous disappeared, while more cracks and larger pores were observed. Additionally, part of surface became dense and compact. It was inferred that a slightly sintering occurred for the NFL during cyclic tests. A large number of pores disappeared on the surface of NFZ, resulted in a dense and smooth structure. The NFZ sample presented obvious sintering and agglomeration after 10 cycles, which agreed with the analysis of the specific surface area."
13,Discussion,"The presence of NiO and supports enhanced significantly the catalytic activity and reaction reactivity of OCs. It was attributed to the interaction between different components changed the physicochemical properties of OCs. NiFe2O4 with spinel structure (AB2O4) was observed in OCs except NFA. NiFe2O4 is a potential candidate as OC in chemical looping processes, exhibited better performance than individual NiO or Fe2O3. Evdou et al. [49] found that NiFe2O4 exhibited high reactivity toward CH4. Kuo et al. [50] reported that NiFe2O4 exhibited excellent redox cycling performance and stability. Huang and Yang et al. [51,52] reported that NiFe2O4 at high temperature presented higher oxygen transfer capacity. Although, the presence of Ni improved the reactivity of Fe-based OC, but also aggravated the carbon deposition in FR. Huang et al. [53] reported that the toluene was cracked into carbon and H2 with NiFe2O4 as a dual-function of oxidation-catalysis. The carbon deposition in FR decreased the hydrogen purity in SR. Thus, the hydrogen purities were relatively low (see Fig. 5(c)). Adding steam in reforming process has been proved to be an effective way to remove carbon deposition. The hydrogen purities of all NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm OCs exceeded 95% when steam was added in SR with S/C = 1.4 (see Fig. 6). The presence of steam enhanced the hydrocarbon reforming, therefore improved syngas yield and purity in FR. However, gas yield in SR decreased sharply. It was mainly attributed to that the conversion of carbon deposition to syngas in FR with the presence of steam. Additionally, it should be noted that the presence of steam in FR suppressed reduction reactions to a certain extent and reduced the hydrogen yield in SR. But it not means that the inhibiting of steam on reduction reaction has no benefit at all. Zeng et al. [53] reported that the presence of steam in FR enhanced the OC particles recyclability. (1) NiO-Fe2O3/Al2O3 oxygen carrier NFA showed the worst performance in the coproduction of hydrogen and syngas. It was attributed to the formation of NiAl2O4 and FeAl2O4 with spinel structure, difficult to be reduced to metallic Ni and Fe. It was unfavorable for the release of lattice oxygen and therefore decreased the oxygen transfer capacity. Metallic Ni was an excellent catalyst for hydrocarbon reforming for syngas production in FR. The presence of NiAl2O4 decreased the catalytic performance, verified by the highest value of ηLC (36.18%). Metallic Fe played an important role in high purity hydrogen production in SR. The formation of FeAl2O4 hindered the deep reduction of Fe species, which resulted in lower hydrogen purity and yield. The NFA as the OC was more suitable for chemical looping steam reforming. (2) NiO-Fe2O3/CeO2 oxygen carrier The CeFeO3 with perovskite structure was observed in the reduced NFC sample. A large number of studies have shown that Ce improve the redox properties of Fe-based OCs due to the formation of CeFeO3 enhanced the oxygen mobility of Ce-Fe OCs [54–56]. Both (Ni, Fe) alloy and Fe were observed in the reduced NFC sample, which was beneficial for NFC to maintain the higher catalytic activity in FR and hydrogen production performance in SR, respectively. The presence of CeFeO3 in reduced sample suppressed the reduction of Fe-based oxide to metallic Fe [34,57]. It could be used to explain that the oxygen transfer capacity of NFC and hydrogen yield in SR were slightly lower than that of NFZ. What’s more, it was conducive to alleviate the sintering of NFC in cyclic tests. (3) NiO-Fe2O3/La2O3 oxygen carrier The NFL exhibited the best performance for syngas production in FR, attributed to the formation of LaFeO3 with perovskite structure. Chen et al. [58]reported that the lattice oxygen in LaFeO3, which derived from the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, was highly selective to the syngas production. The lattice oxygen derived from the conversion of LaFeO3 to LaFeO3-δ have excellent syngas selectivity [59]. It should be noted that the presence of La2O3 obviously promoted the reduction of Fe2O3 from the H2-TPR profiles. NFL exhibited higher reduction temperature than NFC, which was conducive to produce syngas. NFL exhibited the largest specific surface area, conducive to the dispersion of Ni and the diffusion of gaseous molecules. The perovskite structure was observed in reduced sample, hindered the deep reduction of Fe-based oxide. It was inferred that more Fe species were retained in LaFeO3 compared with CeFeO3, therefore the NFL exhibited lower slightly hydrogen yield than NFC. The hydrogen purity decreased gradually in cyclic tests, it should be related to the slight sintering and agglomeration of OC particles. Additionally, the loss of Ni active component in the surface of NFL by evaporation or transformation may also lead to the degradation of its cyclic performance. (4) NiO-Fe2O3/MgO oxygen carrier When MgO was used as support, NFM showed a low oxygen transfer capacity attributed to the formation of MgFe2O4, which was difficult to reduce to Fe, verified by the results of H2-TPR and XRD patterns (see Figs. 10 and 11). Therefore, NFM exhibited a low gas yield in SR. Compared with NFA, NFM exhibited a good performance for chemical reforming. The syngas yield and purity for NFM were slightly higher than that of NFA. It was attributed to the outstanding catalytic performance and anti-carbon deposition capability of NixMgyO solid solution for the hydrocarbon reforming [38]. Both of them were extremely attractive features for syngas production in CLR. In order to obtain high hydrogen yield in CLRWS, it was necessary to focus the study of eyes on how to enhance its reduction performance. (5) NiO-Fe2O3/TiO2 oxygen carrier The Fe2TiO5 was observed in fresh NFT due to the Fe2O3 reacted with TiO2 support. The Fe2TiO5 was reduced into FeTiO3 during the reforming process, which allows almost complete oxidation of H2 and CO [60,61]. The phenomenon was not conducive to syngas and hydrogen coproduction. Similar to FeAl2O4, FeTiO3 was not reduced to metallic Fe, limited by the strong interaction between FeO with TiO2. NFT exhibited the highest initial reduction temperature in H2-TPR test and the lowest oxygen transfer capacity in TGA test. In the presence of steam, NFT did not exhibit obvious advantages compared with the other OCs. (6) NiO-Fe2O3/ZrO2 oxygen carrier Both NiO and Fe2O3 were not reacted with ZrO2. This result did not mean that there is no interaction between the Fe2O3 and ZrO2 support. Both the results of TGA and H2-TPR tests verified that the NFZ was readily release lattice oxygen compared with the other OCs. It tended to produce more CO2 during the reforming process, which was a disadvantage in the syngas production in FR. Conversely, it tended to mitigate the carbon deposition during the reforming process, which was advantageous to obtain high purity hydrogen in SR. However, the NFZ presented a poor stability during the cyclic test. It was attributed to the Fe2O3 on the surface ZrO2 support was deeply reduced into metallic Fe, which was readily sintering and agglomeration during the cyclic tests. In future studies, the sintering resistance of NFZ need to be explored."
14,Conclusion,"In this study, CLRWS process with bio-oil was simulated by the Aspen plus software. Then CLRWS experiments were conducted in the fixed bed reactor for syngas and hydrogen coproduction using NiO-Fe2O3/AnOm (A = Al, Ce, La, Mg, Ti and Zr) as OCs. The process simulation results indicated F/O of 0.3 at 900 °C were appropriate for syngas and high purity hydrogen coproduction in CLRWS process using Fe2O3 as OC. The catalytic reforming and water splitting reactions were enhanced significantly by introducing NiO and supports, while the presence of Ni readily produced higher carbon deposition. More detail conclusions were drawn as following: (1) The formation of FeAl2O4, MgFe2O4, Fe2TiO5, CeFeO3 and LaFeO3 increased the reduction difficulty of the iron-based oxides, decreased the oxygen transfer capacity of OCs, which was unfavorable for the hydrogen production in SR. In general, the NFL, NFZ and NFC presented the better performance for the syngas and hydrogen coproduction than the NFA, NFM and NFT. (2) Without the addition of steam in FR, the highest hydrogen purity was as low as 91.66% for NFC, the corresponding hydrogen yield was 1.255 Nm3/kg; the highest hydrogen yield of 1.283 Nm3/kg was obtained by NFZ, but the hydrogen purity was just 86.24%. The high carbon deposition in FR can be alleviated by the addition of steam in the FR. The hydrogen purity of all OCs increased to more than 95% in SR with S/C = 1.4. The top two hydrogen purity in SR for NFZ and NFC were 99.73% and 99.66%, the corresponding hydrogen yield were 1.132 Nm3/kg and 1.165 Nm3/kg, respectively. (3) The NFC is a promising OC in the CLRWS process with the presence of steam, maintained high hydrogen purity and good stability performance in the multiple cycle tests. The NFL had highest syngas selectivity attributed to the excellent catalytic performance, but its cyclic performance decreased slightly with the increasing of number of cycles. The NFZ exhibited the highest oxygen transfer capacity and the lowest carbon deposition. However, its stability decreased rapidly after five cycles due to the deeply reduction of Fe2O3 lead to sintering and agglomeration."
