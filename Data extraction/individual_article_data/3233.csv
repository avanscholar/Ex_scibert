0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered to be a clean fuel as it just produces water during its controlled oxidation, either by direct combustion or when fed to a fuel cell [1]. However, hydrogen is not a primary energy source, since it cannot be found free in our planet and it must be produced from other compounds. Although water is the ideal H2 source, in short-mid term, its production must be considered from whatever available sources, including fossil fuels [2]. Methane, main component of natural gas, is the hydrocarbon with the highest hydrogen content and, nowadays, the most used hydrogen source. Conventional H2 production is carried out by steam reforming of methane (SMR) [3], although this process emits large quantities of CO2 (at least 1mol of CO2/mol of converted CH4). Thereby, additional stages to separate and capture CO2 so produced must be included, increasing the price of the SMR process whereas its overall efficiency is reduced. A different approach for H2 production is the one based on the methane decomposition reaction (DeCH4) [4,5]: (1) CH 4 ( g ) → 2 · H 2 ( g ) + C ( s ) Δ H 1073 K = 90.1 kJ / mol ( CH 4 ) The main advantage of the DeCH4 process is the production of pure H2, free of CO or CO2, since the carbon contained in the methane molecule is transformed into a carbonaceous solid [6,7]. Accordingly, the hydrogen produced by methane decomposition is optimal for being fed to a fuel cell [8]. Traditionally, methane decomposition has been catalyzed by nickel, copper, iron and a number of noble metals [9,10]. This process is often aimed to the formation of carbon nanotubes, which requires the metal catalyst to be separated and eliminated at the end of the process [10]. However, when the goal of the process is H2 production, the metal catalyst must be recovered and reused to improve the economy of the process. Metal catalysts deactivate quickly by the carbon produced, which settles on the metal surface, regeneration stages being needed. Catalyst regeneration could be accomplished by combustion of the carbon deposits, although this would produce CO2 emissions similar to those of the steam reforming [9,11]. A more appealing option may be the use of carbonaceous materials as catalysts as they present a lower cost than the metallic ones [12]. Moreover, this alternative opens the possibility of preparing the catalyst by activation of the carbon produced during the reaction. In addition, the reaction could become an autocatalytic system provided that the properties of the deposited carbon may be tailored for the latter to be catalytically active in methane decomposition. Nevertheless, since large amounts of solid carbon are obtained by DeCH4, the possible commercial application of this material is also an essential factor to consolidate the technology, which in turn will depend on the properties of the produced carbon [13]. A variety of carbon materials have been recently investigated as DeCH4 catalysts, such as activated carbons [14], carbon blacks [15] and coal chars [16]. Different proposals have been enunciated trying to assign the differences in catalytic activity observed with those materials to a variety of parameters (surface area, polar groups, defects, etc.), but the origin of the activity is still not well established. More recently, we have reported preliminary results about the use of ordered mesoporous carbons as catalysts in this reaction. In particular, two carbon materials belonging to the CMK family [17] have shown to be highly active catalysts for hydrogen production via methane decomposition reaction [18]. The best results were obtained over the CMK-5 carbon, characterized by high surface area and a double mesopore system. This material showed to be a promising catalyst due to its high activity and stability. In this context, the present work has been envisaged to study the main factors governing the catalytic activity of carbon catalysts in DeCH4. Thereby, a wide variety of carbon materials, including the aforementioned CMK-type carbons, have been selected and investigated. Moreover, a detailed characterization of the carbon catalysts has been carried out in order to check and correlate their main properties with their activity."
1,Experimental,
2,Carbon catalysts,"2.1 Carbon catalysts Ordered mesoporous carbons, CMK-3 and CMK-5, were synthesized by a nanocasting pathway using pure silica SBA-15 as hard-template. The synthesis procedure, which has been reported in literature [19], is described below. 2.1.1 SBA-15 preparation Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, Aldrich) and a non-ionic triblock copolymer (Pluronic P123, Aldrich) were used as silica source and as structure directing agent, respectively [20]. Firstly, a mixture containing 4g Pluronic P123: 0.041mol TEOS: 6.67mol H2O: 0.24mol HCl was prepared. After the occurrence of hydrolysis-condensation reactions at 40°C for 6h, the clear solution was hydrothermally treated at 90°C during 3days. The resultant white solids were filtrated and, finally, calcined at 550°C during 6h under static air. 2.1.2 CMK carbons preparation For the synthesis of CMK carbons, furfuryl alcohol (FA, Acros Organics) was used as carbon precursor, trimethylbenzene (TMB, Aldrich) as solvent and oxalic acid (OA, Acros Organics) as polymerization catalyst. The synthesis procedure comprised the following steps: (a) filling the pores of SBA-15 with a solution containing 0.012g OA/3mL FA in TMB by the wetness impregnation technique; (b) polymerization of the carbon precursor within the SBA-15 pores by heat treatment at 50°C for 1day and, then, at 90°C for 2days; (c) carbonization under inert atmosphere by first heating at 150°C for 3h, secondly heating to 300°C at 1°C/min, then heating to 850°C at 5°C/min, and finally keeping the last temperature for 3h; (d) removal of the silica template by dissolution with an ethanol–water mixture containing 1M NaOH; (e) filtration and washing of the black powders; and (f) drying at 90°C overnight. CMK-3 sample was obtained by using pure FA in the impregnation solution, while for CMK-5 preparation a solution containing 50% FA in TMB was used. As a consequence, in the last case the pores in SBA-15 were not completely filled by the carbon precursor. In addition, a number of industrially manufactured carbons were evaluated as catalysts for methane decomposition. These materials were selected as representatives of a variety of carbon types exhibiting a high range of properties: two carbon blacks (Vulcan XC72 and Black Pearls 2000, both from Cabot Corp.), one activated carbon (Merck), two multi-walled nanotubes, one with high metal loading (Sun Nanotech.) and another one with a low metal loading (Electrovac nanofibers), two cokes, one regular type and one recarburizer coke (both provided by Repsol YPF), and one graphite (Fluka)."
3,Carbon catalyst characterization,"2.2 Carbon catalyst characterization The possible presence of metals in the carbon catalysts was checked by ICP spectrophotometry using a Varian VISTA AX CCD instrument. Textural properties and BET surface area of the catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption/desorption at 77K, by using a Micromeritics TRISTAR 3000 instrument. The surface area was calculated by applying the BET equation, whereas the contribution of micropores and external surface to both volume and surface area was evaluated by means of the t-plot method. XRD patterns of commercial samples were recorded using a Philips PW 3040/00 X’Pert MPD/MRD diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 0.2degs−1, in the 2θ range of 5–60°. The degree of arrangement of graphene planes for each carbon catalyst was studied using the characteristics graphitic C (002) and C (101) peaks. XPS measurements of carbons were acquired with a VG Escalab 200R spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and a Mg Kα (hν =1253.6eV) X-ray source. Survey and multi-region spectra were recorded at C1s and O1s photoelectron peaks. The peaks were fitted by a non-linear least square fitting program using a properly weighted sum of Lorentzian and Gaussian component curves after background subtraction according to Shirley and Sherwood. The constant charging of the samples was corrected by referencing all energies to the C1s peak contribution at 284.8eV."
4,CH4 decomposition experiments,"2.3 CH4 decomposition experiments Catalytic tests were carried out in a thermobalance (TA Instruments TG/DTA SDT 2960 thermal analyser) by following the sample weight increase during the reaction caused by the carbon deposition on the catalyst (Eq. (1)). The catalytic tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure, by switching a flow of 100mLmin−1 of methane (10% CH4 in Ar), using about 30μl of each catalyst (i.e. different weights for each carbon) placed in a ceramic pan (90μl of capacity). Carbon was produced as the reaction progressed, being deposited over the catalyst within the ceramic pan. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were dried under N2 flow until 250°C. After drying, the samples were purged under the flow of the reaction mixture at 50°C, and the temperature was increased in the range 50–1100°C with a constant heating rate of 10°Cmin−1, being kept constant at 1100°C for 20min. The initial catalytic activity was evaluated for each catalyst by using the threshold temperature (T th, defined as the temperature at which the hydrogen production reached 0.1mmolg−1). Likewise, the average reaction rate in the temperature range corresponding to the ramp was determined from the amount of carbon deposited over the catalyst along that period. The hydrogen production was calculated from Eq. (1)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Carbon catalyst properties,"3.1 Carbon catalyst properties The carbonaceous solids used as catalysts for DeCH4 were selected in order to include in the study materials having a wide range of physicochemical properties, as it is summarized in Table 1. The textural properties of the catalysts have been derived from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms shown in Fig. 1 . AC, CB-bp and CMKs are high surface area materials. In the case of the activated carbon (AC), the surface area is originated mainly by the presence of microporosity, as denoted by the type I isotherm corresponding to this material. For the CB-bp sample a combination of microporosity and external surface area is present as it is formed by nanoparticles. On the other hand, the CB-v sample exhibits little microporosity, which is consistent with being formed mainly by non-porous nanoparticles. The sample of multi-wall nanotubes presents a small surface area, whereas this parameter is even lower for the graphite and coke samples. Both CMK materials exhibit type IV isotherms, denoting clearly the presence of mesoporosity. CMK-3 shows a single adsorption step featured by an inflection point at a relative pressure about 0.30, which indicates that this material is formed by just one type of mesopores. In contrast, two steps can be observed for the CMK-5 sample. Thus, in addition to the main step with inflection point at a relative pressure about 0.30, a second adsorption step occurs at higher relative pressures (ca. P/P 0 =0.55). As earlier reported, both CMK samples have in common a pore system of 3nm diameter size [18]. This porosity corresponds to the cavities generated by the removal of the silica template. Accordingly, these mesopores are a replica of the silica walls in SBA-15, which implies that their size is determined by the width of the latter. A second type of mesopores, located at 5.8nm, appears for CMK-5. This additional mesoporosity is due to the partial filling of the SBA-15 pores with the carbon precursor during the CMK-5 preparation. In this case, the size of these mesopores is determined by the diameter of the mesopores in SBA-15, although having a smaller size due to the partial filling, polymerization and carbonization of the carbon precursor. The graphenic crystallinity of the carbon catalysts can be derived from their XRD patterns (Fig. 2 ). Taken into account the enlargement factor used in this figure, a marked difference of crystallinity can be established between the samples. These differences can be quantified using the ratio between two of the peaks typical of graphenic materials, C(002) at 2θ =26° and C(101) at 2θ =44° (Table 1). This ratio is usually taken as indicative of the order of the graphene sheets for each carbon sample [21]. Thus, the highly ordered planes of graphite (GRAPH), which are piled up, show a low value of this ratio. On the contrary, strongly disordered materials having a high surface area, as it is the case of AC and CB-bp, present a XRD ratio close to 1. For the CMK carbons, the (002) reflection shifts towards lower angles, which indicates a higher curvature of the graphene layers, as typical of turbostratic carbons [14,15]. In order to further quantify the degree of arrangement of the graphene layers, as well as to characterize the chemical nature of the catalyst surface, XPS spectra were recorded. Table 2 summarizes the binding energies of C1s and O1s levels. Fig. 3a and b displays C1s and O1s, respectively, core-level spectra of a representative CB-bp sample. In addition to the peak corresponding to the π–π* transition, with a binding energy of 291.3eV, each spectrum was fitted to different components and the respective binding energies and peak percentages are also collected in Table 2. The C1s profiles were fitted to four components: (i) asymmetrical so-called graphite peak at 284.8eV linked to carbon polyaromatic structures, (ii) carbon atoms single bonded to oxygen at 286.3eV, e.g. alcohols and phenols (C–OH), (iii) double CO bonds from ketones and aldehydes at 287.8eV, and (iv) carbon atoms with three C–O bonds (–COO–) at 289.3eV from carboxylic groups [22,23]. All samples present the same four peaks (Table 2), although the difference between them relays on the population of each component. The exception is graphite in which the C1s spectrum only presents three components (no C1s carboxylic component was detected). Besides the chemical nature of the surface, XPS analyses also permit to study the nature of the basal planes of graphene layers: the broadening of the C1s line is an indication of the presence of several environments distinct of the hexagonal polyaromatic carbons. In an ideal graphene layer, the 2p orbitals of the carbon atoms overlap and form a large system of delocalized π electrons. Defects in the graphene layers avoid overlapping of the 2p orbitals [24], which are linked to their degree of arrangement (graphitization). In the literature, two types of defects can be found: vacancy and topological defects [25–27]. Vacancies are formed in the graphite open edge or in the lattice vacancy, most usually as mono-vacancy or di-vacancy (Fig. 4 a and b, respectively). Topological defects can be recognized as polygonal defects other than hexagonal. The simplest topological defect in a planar hexagonal network is double pairs of pentagonal and heptagonal defects, called Stone Wales defect (Fig. 4c). The presence of all these types of graphene defects produces a distortion of the binding energy corresponding to the polyaromatic carbons. The FWHM of the graphite peak at 284.8eV is considered to be directly related to the number of the aforementioned defects in the graphene structure [24,28]. Consequently, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) increases with increasing the proportion of any of these defects. A high concentration of defects in the graphene layers leads to a wide graphite peak and to a high value of the FWHM parameter. Table 2 shows the FWHM values for the most representative starting carbons studied. The trend in the defect concentration obtained by XPS follows the next order: CMK- 5 > CMK- 3 > AC ≈ CB-bp > CB-v > MWNT- 1 > GRAPH A relationship may be observed between the defect concentration and the more or less pronounced disordered nature of the samples. However, CMK samples exhibit a special behaviour, as they are the materials having the highest defect concentration in the graphene structure while presenting and intermediate crystallinity."
7,CH4 decomposition over carbon catalysts,"3.2 CH4 decomposition over carbon catalysts Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the hydrogen production during the methane decomposition obtained in temperature-programmed experiments for the different carbonaceous materials employed as catalysts. Table 3 summarizes the DeCH4 catalytic results obtained with these materials. Previously, it was checked through blank experiments carried out in absence of any catalyst, that the thermal methane decomposition was negligible, at least under the reaction conditions employed in these temperature programmed tests. The first parameter determined to compare the catalytic properties of the different samples is the threshold temperature (T th), defined as the temperature corresponding to the detection of the first catalytic activity, which was denoted by the beginning in the formation of hydrogen and carbon. In practice, the threshold temperature was calculated as the temperature at which the hydrogen production reached 0.1mmol H2 g−1 of catalyst. Low T th values correspond with materials having high initial catalytic activity. The following order of the threshold temperature is derived from the data summarized in Table 3: CMK- 3 < CMK- 5 < CB-bp ≈ AC < CB-v < MWNT- 1 ≈ MWNT- 2 < GRAPH < Coke It is remarkable that, in spite of the carbonaceous nature of all the samples, the threshold temperature varies in a wide range (from 744°C for CMK-3 to 995°C for one of the coke samples). As we have reported in a previous work [18], CMK materials are very active catalysts in methane decomposition. Thus, both CMKs exhibit the lowest threshold temperature with values even quite lower than those corresponding to the AC and CB-bp samples. It must be noted that the latter have been earlier reported in the literature as the carbonaceous materials having the highest initial catalytic activity in methane decomposition [12]. On the other hand, two carbon nanotube samples have been tested in order to check the effect of the metal presence. Both materials present practically the same T th and similar hydrogen production rates (Table 3). Since the metal content of both samples is very different (14.8wt.% in MWNT-1 and 3wt.% in MWNT-2), it can be concluded that the effect of the metallic species on the catalytic activity is not relevant, at least under the conditions employed in this work. The activity order undergoes some changes when the catalyst behaviour is compared at long reaction times. Under those conditions, the activated carbon sample becomes quickly deactivated. Accordingly, the deactivation process seems to be linked to the presence of micropores. In contrast, long-term activity is retained in those materials formed by mesopores (CMKs) or nanoparticles (black carbons), which makes them more resistant to deactivation by pore blockage caused by the formation of carbonaceous deposits. After about 25min of reaction, the hydrogen production rate of both CMK samples slows down, showing a sharp change in the curve slope. As we have reported previously, such transition is related to the partial filling of their pore network so that diffusional restrictions appear [18]. Nevertheless, after that change, both CMKs still exhibit an important and almost constant production rate of hydrogen. This behaviour may only be explained considering that the carbon formed is not accumulated within the mesopores but leaves the pores towards the outer part of the CMK particles. In conclusion, the CMK-5 material remains by far the most active catalyst at long reaction times. The average reaction rate in the period corresponding to the temperature ramp has been calculated for the different catalysts, the results obtained being shown in Table 3. This parameter can be considered to provide an overall hydrogen production rate that includes the joint effects of both initial catalytic activity and possible catalyst deactivation. Coke and graphite are again materials exhibiting very low, or even negligible, average reaction rates, which is in a great part due to their really high threshold temperatures. However, in the case of the AC its low T th does not correspond with a high average reaction rate, which indicates that for this catalyst its fast deactivation has a predominant effect. Following the reaction rate order, the next materials are carbon nanotubes and carbon blacks. Finally, it is remarkable the high average reaction rate obtained with both CMKs carbons. Especially interesting is the case of the CMK-5 material as it presents a reaction rate twice that of CMK-3 and several times superior to those of carbon blacks. Moreover, CMK-5 remains as the material having the highest reaction rate also in the temperature-constant period, as denoted by the largest curve slope it exhibits. This really remarkable catalytic behaviour of CMK-5 can be explained by a right combination of high initial catalytic activity and strong resistance to deactivation."
8,Relationship catalytic activity/carbon properties,"3.3 Relationship catalytic activity/carbon properties A number of factors have been proposed as the origin of the carbonaceous material activity in DeCH4 [7,14,29]. One of them is the BET surface area of the catalyst. The results here obtained indicate that a relationship between surface area and carbon activity could exist (Tables 1 and 3 ). Thus, the lowest T th values correspond with carbon materials having the highest BET surface areas (CMKs, AC and CB-bp samples). In contrast, materials with low surface area (graphite and cokes) present high T th. However, the relationship between surface area and catalytic activity is not so evident when comparing graphically the behaviour of different carbon catalysts. Fig. 6 depicts the values of the T th parameter versus the BET surface area. A clear and proportional relationship cannot be found, showing that the surface area is not the only one factor determining the catalytic activity of the carbon materials. Thus, the CB-v sample presents relatively low surface area, while its threshold temperature is quite low, denoting the high initial activity of this material for catalyzing the methane decomposition reaction. Another parameter proposed in the literature as closely related to the origin of the carbonaceous material activity in DeCH4 is the presence of oxygenated groups on the carbon surface [14,29]. Accordingly, the threshold temperature obtained in the DeCH4 experiments has been represented in Fig. 7 versus the total percentage of oxygenated groups in the carbon catalysts determined by XPS. No clear relationship can be established between the concentration of oxygenated groups and the initial catalytic activity but, on the contrary, the points show a high degree of dispersion. The same conclusion is derived if the different types of oxygenated species (C–OH, –COO– and CO) are individually considered. Therefore, the concentration of oxygenated groups does not seem to be directly related to the value of the threshold temperature for methane decomposition. The more or less pronounced graphitic nature of the carbons can be considered another property that may influence the catalytic behaviour. To check this alternative, the threshold temperature has been represented in Fig. 8 versus the relative intensity of the XRD peaks corresponding to C(101) and C(002) diffractions. As above indicated, this ratio is usually taken as indicative of the order of graphene sheets. From Fig. 8, it can be observed that higher values of this ratio, i.e. lower graphenic order, lead to a reduction in the threshold temperature, suggesting that this parameter is related to the catalytic activity in methane decomposition. However, the correlation is far from being perfect. Thus, the values corresponding to the CMK materials deviate strongly from the general trend. Both CMK-3 and CMK-5 samples exhibit lower threshold temperatures than those expected taking into account their degree of graphitic order. The last carbon property proposed to correlate the initial DeCH4 catalytic activity is the amount of the defects on the carbon surface [12,16,30], although no quantitative studies on their concentration in the carbon catalysts employed in this reaction have been so far carried out in the literature. In our case, and as indicated above, the XPS measurement has allowed the defect population in the graphene layers to be quantified through the value of the FWHM parameter in the C1s peak at 284.8eV. These defects decrease the electronic stability in the vicinity of the graphenic structure, increasing the carbon reactivity. Therefore, it can be envisaged that the origin of the carbon catalyst activity is related to the defect population on its surface. In order to check this proposal, the threshold temperature has been depicted in Fig. 9 versus the defect concentration measured through the FWHM parameter. A good correlation can be clearly observed for both parameters, showing that T th is almost inversely proportional to the FWHM values. Nevertheless, some deviation is observed for the CMK-5 sample, as it shows a threshold temperature somewhat higher than that expected according to its defect concentration. Even so, these result supports strongly that the major property governing the carbon activity is the defect concentration present in the graphene layers rather than the surface area. Nevertheless, it must be taken into account that the surface area and the defect concentration are not completely independent variables, as a higher carbon surface area should correspond usually with a higher number of defects. This fact explains why both properties show a similar variation among the carbon catalysts, although in quantitative terms the catalytic activity is best correlated with the defect concentration present in the graphene layers. Finally, and regarding the possible reaction mechanism, it is proposed that in principle the different type of graphene defects may catalyze the methane decomposition according to the steps proposed by Muradov et al. [12]. (a) Methane adsorption and dissociation on the active sites ( CH 4 ) g → ( CH 3 ) ads + ( H ) ads (b) Progressive dissociation releasing hydrogen-rich adsorbed species ( CH 3 ) ads → ( CH 2 ) ads + ( H ) ads ( CH 2 ) ads → ( CH ) ads + ( H ) ads (c) Crystallization and growth of the carbon deposits ( CH ) ads → ( C ) ads + ( H ) ads ( C ) ads → 1 / n ( C n ) c ( carbon crystalline growth ) (d) Formation and desorption of H2 gas 2 · ( H ) ads → ( H 2 ) g where subscripts ads denotes a specie adsorbed on the active site, c denotes crystalline, and g denotes gaseous species. Accordingly, the defects present in the graphene layers would be the preferential sites for methane adsorption and dissociation, releasing progressively to the gas phase the hydrogen adsorbed atoms as they are recombined into H2 gas. This process would lead to species which present gradually higher carbon content. Depending on the catalysts nature and on its pore structure, the carbon being formed may remain within the pores, causing their blockage and the catalyst deactivation, or may leave the pores growing to the outer part of the catalyst particles. The latter is expected to occur mainly with catalysts having a high share of external surface area (carbon blacks) or an ordered and interconnected mesoporosity (CMKs), explaining the higher resistance to the deactivation shown by these carbon catalysts."
9,Conclusions,"The activity of a variety of carbon materials (ordered mesoporous carbons, activated carbon, carbon blacks, multi-wall nanotubes, cokes and graphites) in hydrogen production by methane decomposition has been compared with their main physicochemical properties in order to determine which is the factor governing the catalytic activity. The experiments, carried out under temperature programmed conditions, have allowed the threshold temperature to be determined for each catalyst. The latter corresponds with the minimum temperature for a catalyst to exhibit activity in methane decomposition. No definitive correlation has been found between the threshold temperature and parameters such as surface area, crystallinity and the concentration of oxygenated groups. However, a decreasing linear relationship has been found to exist between the threshold temperature and the proportion of defects in the graphene layers quantified by the value of the FWHM parameter in the C1s XPS peak at 284.8eV. Thus, in temperature-programmed experiments, the highest initial activity (measured as threshold temperature) is exhibited by those carbon materials having a high defect concentration, such as CMKs, activated carbon or carbon blacks. On the other hand, highly ordered carbon catalysts present little activity. The activity order undergoes some changes when the catalyst behaviour is compared at long reaction times. Under those conditions, activated carbon becomes quickly deactivated, which is assigned to the microporous nature of this material. Likewise, CMKs exhibit along the time a sharp change in the slope of the hydrogen production curve. Nevertheless, even so CMK-5 remains as the most active catalysts at long reaction times. The deactivation process is largely determined by the presence of micropores whereas long-term activity is exhibited by those materials having mesopores (CMKs) or formed by nanoparticles (CBs), which make them more resistant to deactivation by pore blockage caused by the formation of carbonaceous deposits."
