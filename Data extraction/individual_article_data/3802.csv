0,Introduction,"Photocatalysis has grown enormously in the last few decades with new developments in semiconductor materials active under solar-light for energy conversion [1–4], environmental remediation, and organic synthesis [5–9]. Among them, the photocatalytic processes related to hydrogen production are one of the most studied because of the interesting properties of hydrogen as an energy carrier and fuel. The solar photoproduction of hydrogen from biomass-derived substances (ethanol, methanol, bio-oil, sugars,.) is an interesting option to produce renewable hydrogen decoupled from the fossil carbon sources and this technology appears as a humble and competent approach to store and distribute the solar vitality in the system of H–H bonds. Among the renewable molecules to produce hydrogen by photocatalysis under visible light, glycerol is particularly interesting because of its high availability and low price as a byproduct in the catalytic transesterification for the manufacture of biodiesel. The photocatalytic hydrogen production using glycerol involves its hydrogenolysis and dehydration to propylene glycol and glyceraldehyde by the photoinduced holes (h) or by secondary OH· activists, and the subsequent dehydration, dehydrogenation, and decarbonylation to produce CO/CO2 and hydrogen [6]. Photoreforming of glycerol for hydrogen production has been mainly studied over TiO2-based photocatalysts coated with metal particles (Pt, Au, Pd, Ni, Pt, Cu, …) that act as cocatalysts [10,11]. However, the overall efficiency of the TiO2-based photocatalysts under solar light is low, only attaining extraordinary photocatalytic action under UV-light irradiation. For this reason, the investigation is attentive to the progress of new semiconductors, active and stable under visible light. Among these semiconductor photocatalysts, the graphitized carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) are materials extensively studied in several photocatalytic areas that include degradation of organic pollutants, NO oxidation, reduction of CO2, synthetic organic reactions [6,10]. The g-C3N4 is a semiconductor that has decent electronic properties, resistance to chemical and photochemical corrosion [12,13], and potential to absorb a considerable amount of the solar light with relatively higher wavelengths (bandgap value (Eg) of 2.7 eV) [3,4]. These characteristics make it a suitable material as photocatalyst for hydrogen generation from biomass-derived substances. The graphitic planes of g-C3N4 consist of tri-s-triazine components connected to planar amino assemblies making C3N4 polymers with tunable electronic possessions that assist the generation of active radicals through the excitation of electrons (e). In this sense, the CB of the g-C3N4 (−1.13 eV versus NHE) has a strong reduction capability to dynamically reduce protons and oxygen to superoxide radical in the form of (O2 •−) and utilized in H2 generation by photoreduction of organic compounds as glycerol. Despite this, the quantum competence of g-C3N4 is still stumpy because of the high recombination degree of the photoinduced charges. Thus, the restricted efficiency in the visible light range and the low surface as the polymers tend to agglomerate [14–17]. To progress the efficiency of g-C3N4 under visible sunlit, several strategies have been employed: bandgap engineering through doping, the combination of g-C3N4 with other semiconductors with different energy levels [12,15,16,18] and improve the surface structure of g-C3N4 by exfoliation [20,21] or synthesis of the g-C3N4 into mesoporous materials [10,19,22]. Exfoliation of g-C3N4 using thermal, chemical, or mechanical methods to obtain bidimensionally (2D) nanosheets is a resourceful approach to improve the photoefficiency of g-C3N4 because this type of nanostructures enhances the surface properties and also decreases the diffusion length for the photogenerated charge carriers reducing its recombination [23]. The preparation of mesoporous g-C3N4 is another strategy deeply studied in the literature as a way to progress the photoefficiency of g-C3N4 through the expansion of open porosity and increasing surface area (SA) that enhances both the light-harvesting ability of the material and facilitates the mass transfer. Numerous approaches were used to form mesoporous g-C3N4 (template, thermal, sol-gel, …) and among them, stand out those based on thermal treatments or templating using mesoporous silica for their ease and efficiency. For example, porous and large SA g-C3N4 prepared by thermal methods have been anticipated by Wang et al. and others [10,22] showing that the synthesized materials were able to easily fascinate visible sunlit and improve its photoefficiency in comparison to the bulk one. Inspired in the latest improvements to prepare g-C3N4 exhibiting decent surface texture and improved competence. Herein, we prepare mesostructured g-C3N4 via a hard-template procedure with mesoporous silica materials as a template. In this method, the source solution of g-C3N4 is perfused into the silica template. Then after the nitride polymerization, the template is subsequently removed finally generating the desired mesoporous g-C3N4 [19]. The coupling of g-C3N4 to other semiconductors with complementary energy levels (CdS, TiO2, graphene, Fe3O4, WO3, BiOI, Bi2O3, …) is another strategy to advance the parting of the photoproduced charges by developing in the dynamics of charges between the coupled semiconductors and outspreading the range of light absorption [13,15–18,24–26]. In this context, the Bi2O3 has been widely investigated as a hopeful aspirant for connection with g-C3N4 owing to its complementary energy levels and good light absorption properties [13,27,28]. Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) has six main crystallographic polymorphs and the most stable two phases (namely, α and β), with Eg of ~2.8 and ~2.4 eV respectively [28]), are active under visible light with high ability to oxidation processes (α- Bi2O3 and β- Bi2O3, show +2.9 and + 3.17 V ability to oxidation values versus NHE, respectively) [29–31]. The efficiency to separate the photogenerated charges in the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 composites depends on the heterojunctions established at the interface between both semiconductors and the preparation methodologies used for the synthesis of the composites (physical mixing, thermal treatments) must facilitate the interfacial contacts between semiconductors where the charge-transfer takes place. Depending on the contact level developed between both semiconductors, the Z-scheme or type-II p-n junctions could operate as a mechanism to detach the charges in the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 composites [18,28,32]. Methodologies of synthesis that produces small Bi2O3 nanoparticles with intimate contact with g-C3N4 [27,29,32–34] favors the Z-scheme configuration during photocatalytic reactions on the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 composites while methodologies producing a poorer contact between both semiconductors forms heterojunctions in which the mechanism of the photocharge migration between Bi2O3/g-C3N4 is type-II p-n junctions [35]. With this background, we propose in this work to study a sequence of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites synthesized by a new simple technique that combines mesoporous Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 materials. Taking into account that the properties of the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites strongly depend on the contacts established between them, in this work we studied a series of nanocomposites with different Bi2O3 loading (0.5–5 M %). Physicochemical description of the gained powders by various tools have been carried out to determine the contacts and interfaces developed in the nanocomposites and how they influence their photophysical possessions. The photocatalytic enhancement of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites was appraised in the production of hydrogen under visible light."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Pluronic F127 (EO106-PO70-EO106, MWav = 12,600 g mol−1) was used as a surfactant tri-block copolymer. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), ethanol (CH3CH2O), acetic acid (CH3COOH), and bismuth nitrate hydrate (Bi(NO3)3 5H2O) were used without further purification and taken from Sigma–Aldrich. Urea (CO(NH2)2) and dicyandiamide (C2H4N4) were also bought from Merck. Ultrapure Milli-Q H2O used in all amalgamation."
3,Preparation of mesoporous Bi2O3,"2.2 Preparation of mesoporous Bi2O3 The mesoporous Bi2O3 was prepared by a sol-gel synthesis utilizing Pluronic F127 as a structure mediator [38]. The mesoporous oxide was synthesized using the following molar ratio: Bi(NO3)3:F127:C2H5OH:HCl: CH3COOH is 1:0.025:50:2.3:3.8. In a general procedure, 1.65 g of F127 was added to 32 mL of ethyl alcohol and it was kept under magnetic stirring for 60 min. After that, 0.75 mL of HCl plus 2.32 mL of CH3COOH were poured slowly to the previous solution and maintained under magnetic stirring for 30 min. Then, the required bismuth nitrate amount was incorporated into the previous solution and maintained below rousing for 60 min. To evaporate the ethanol and to form the gel, the previous solution was transferred to a humidity-controlled chamber (humidity = 40%) and continued at 40 °C for 12 h. After that, the solids were aged at 65 °C for 24 h then finally heated in air at 400 °C at 1◦Cmin−1 heating rate for 4 h to obtain the final Bi2O3 products."
4,Production of mesostructured g-C3N4,"2.3 Production of mesostructured g-C3N4 The g-C3N4 was synthesized through a hard-template scheme utilizing high SA mesostructured silica (HMS) as a pattern, and prepared as reported in the literature [36]. About 1.0 g of HMS was suspended in 0.05 L of Mili-Q H2O and ultrasonicated for 30 min. After that, a mixture of 5.0 g of urea plus 3.0 g of dicyandiamide was carefully put into the HMS suspension. Formerly, the dispersion was frenzied at 85 °C for overnight to dryness. The dry solid was treated at 550 °C for 4 h under air to produce the pyrolysis that generates the carbon nitrides. After calcination, the obtained material was immersed into 50 mL of 2 M NH4HF2 solution and maintained under strong rousing for a day to remove the HMS. Then, the yielded solid was filtered, rinsed several periods with pure water, and lastly dehydrated at 100 °C for 12 h."
5,Fabrication of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites,"2.4 Fabrication of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites Applying the sonication-mixture method, the suspension of 0.25 g of the previously created mesoporous g-C3N4 mixed with the required amount of mesoporous β-Bi2O3 (to achieve 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 molar % of Bi2O3 in the nanocomposite) in a 400 mL of ultrapure Mili-Q water. The suspension was sonicated for 3 h under a power of 40 KHz to facilitate the exfoliation of g-C3N4 with the formation of 2D nanosheets and its contact with Bi2O3 on the nanosheets. Then, the gained powder was thoroughly washed by centrifugation numerous times with H2O and subsequently desiccated at 80 °C for 12 h. The final Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were labelled as xBi2O3/g-C3N4 where x signifies the nominal molar content of Bi2O3 in the composite (x = 0.5%, 1%, 3%, and 5%)."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization A Bruker AXS D4 X-ray diffractogram using Cu Kα radiation was used to obtain crystalline structures for the produced materials. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS, Thermo Scientific) was laboring to investigate the binding energies, elemental analysis, and the oxidation statuses of the synthesized materials. A PerkinElmer instrument using KBr technique was used to detect the in the Fourier transforms infrared spectrometer over the range of 400–4000 wavenumber. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F electron microscope, Japan) employed to get morphology. The photoluminescence (PL) was examined at room temperature by RF-5301 Spectrofluorophotometer, SHIMADZU, Japan utilizing a 150 W Xe lamp at excitation λ ~365 nm. A Quantachrome Autosorb instrument was used to perform the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The samples were also degassed at 210 °C overnight. A Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation was used to display photocurrent through the measurements of transient photocurrent."
7,Photocatalytic activity assessments,"2.6 Photocatalytic activity assessments The photoactivity of all obtained powders was assessed in the production of H2 from the photoreduction of aqueous glycerol using visible light. The photoactivity was measured in a 250 mL Pyrex reactor having a window cell at atmospheric temperature and pressure and irradiated with a 500W Xe lamp (vertically fixed) prepared with of UV-cut sieve (>420 nm). 50 mg of the photocatalysts was suspended by magnetically inspiring in 200 mL aqueous solution of glycerol (10% vol.) and purged with Ar for 15 min to ensure the complete air removal in the suspension prior light irradiation. After purging, the suspension, vigorously stirred, was irradiated during 9 h, and the gaseous products were sampled every hour. The hydrogen production was quantified using an Agilent GC 7890A gas chromatograph with a TCD sensor."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Depiction of the produced photocatalysts,"3.1 Depiction of the produced photocatalysts The crystalline structure of all composites including the parent trials was resolute by X-ray diffractograms as in Fig. 1 . The XRD configuration of the bare g-C3N4 shows the main diffraction at 27.4° and a second weak peak at 13.0° which corresponds to the (002) reflection (3.25 Å) and the in-plane reflections (6.9 Å) respectively of polymeric graphitic C3N4 (JCPDS No. 87-1526). The XRD configuration of pristine Bi2O3 shows diffraction heights of low intensity that indicates low sample crystallinity and size. Despite this, the XRD pattern is shown small diffraction signals which matched well with (210), (201), and (220) reflections of the tetragonal β-Bi2O3 phase (JCPDS No. 65-1209) [37]. The XRD patterns of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 composites only unveil the diffraction peaks conforming to g-C3N4. In the composites, no diffraction peaks are observed for Bi2O3 species because of the low loading, intensity and overlapping of the diffraction peaks of Bi2O3 with those of the g-C3N4. The greatness of the diffraction peak corresponding to (002) reflection of g-C3N4 in the composite phase decreases gradually by means of the increase in Bi2O3 loading. The (002) reflection is typical of the inter-layer assembling of g-C3N4 [38] and therefore the reduction of the (002) intensity indicates higher nanosheet exfoliation as the Bi2O3 loading increases. This could be assigned, according to Yuan et al. [39] to the higher intercalation of Bi2O3 in the stacking of g-C3N4 that facilitates its ultrasonic liquid exfoliation. The SA of obtained structures were measured from of its N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Table 1 ). The N2 adsorption-desorption lines of g-C3N4 (in Fig. 2 a) shows a typical isotherm with H2 hysteresis loop of IV type at 0.35–0.78, which indicated a complex pore mesoporous structure [40,41]. The g-C3N4 has extraordinary specific SA (190 m2g-1, Table 1) that superior than that reported for bulk g-C3N4 (<15 m2g-1). The pure Bi2O3 sample (Fig. 2b) also exhibits a type IV isotherm with H4 hysteresis loop at 0.45–0.80 indicating a limited mesoporous structure with networks of pores of different size and shape. The pure Bi2O3 sample also shows an extraordinary BET specific SA (170 m2g-1, Table 1), an area much larger than that developed by commercial Bi2O3 samples prepared by conventional methods (<1 m2/g). The isotherm of the 3% Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite (Fig. 2c) shows an IV-type isotherm too, as that previously indicated for the bare g-C3N4, indicating a mesoporous structure in the nanocomposite. However, the hysteresis loop in the nanocomposite is very different because it displays a type IV isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop characteristic of slit-like pores compared to the parent C3N4. The change in mesoporosity could be regarded as the accumulation of g-C3N4 nanosheets formed in the exfoliation manner used in the synthesis of the nanocomposites as previously observed by the XRD. The hysteresis loop in the nanocomposite decreased respect to the parent g-C3N4, which implies less mesoporous development in the former. This is in line with the lower specific SAs exhibited by the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites (around 170 m2g-1, Table 1) respect to the area developed by the untainted g-C3N4. The increase in the Bi2O3 loading from 0.5 to 5 molar % produces a minor increase in the SA of the nanocomposites (from 171 to 174 m2/g). This fact could be related to the variation in the layer separation degree of the g-C3N4. It was perceived from the XRD results higher nanosheet delimitation of g-C3N4 as the Bi2O3 loading in the nanocomposites increases. Nevertheless, the SA of all of the nanocomposites remains high to guarantee a pore system that facilitates the transport of reactants and the absorption of light. The functional group present in the prepared nanocomposites were analyzed by FTIR as in Fig. 3 . The bare g-C3N4 (Fig. 3a) show bands around 3125 cm−1 credited to NH stretching vibration [42], the features in the 1650-1200 cm−1 allocated to the CN elongation (1640 cm−1), the tri-s-triazine ring stretching (1580-1450 cm−1) [42], the secondary bridging of primary amines (1410–1200 cm−1) beside a sharp feature at 807 cm−1 recognized to bending modes of the tri-s-triazine heterocyclic ring [43]. The spectra of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites (Fig. 3b and c) are similar to those previously described for bare g-C3N4 signifying the integrity after the contact with Bi2O3. There is no evidence of the Bi–O twisting feature at ~520 and 629 cm−1 in the nanocomposites. Only a reduction in the height of the absorption summits of g-C3N4 was witnessed in the nanocomposites in parallel with the increase in the Bi2O3 loading in the composite. This fact indicates the effect of introducing the Bi2O3 on the superficial functional groups of the g-C3N4 [44]. The chemical form and concentration of the elements existing in the external area of the 3.0% Bi2O3/g-C3N4, as representative of the nanocomposites, were determined by XPS analyzing the high-resolution energy levels of all constituent elements as represented in Fig. 4 . In Fig. 4a, there are two symmetrical peaks at ~159.2 eV and ~164.4 for Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 levels correspondingly associated with Bi3+ ions of β-Bi2O3 [45,46]. The Bi 4f binding energies are slightly shifted compared with that reported for bare Bi2O3 (158.7 and 164.4 eV) which denotes modifications in the Bi2O3 by connection to the g-C3N4. The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 4b) shows one symmetric peak at 529.8 eV matching with the lattice O2− anions in β-Bi2O3 [47]. No other oxygen contributions different from lattice oxygen were detected in the O1s spectra. The C 1s core-level spectrum (Fig. 4c) displays an intense component at 284.6 eV with a shoulder around 285.6 eV and a second highest contribution at ~ 287.5 eV. The former component at 284.5 eV is typical of graphitized carbon. The shoulder at 285.6 eV is credited to sp2 hybridized carbon of CC or CN2 links. The uttermost at 287.5 eV signifying the e-s of the heptazine units [48,49]. Therefore, the C 1s XPS level evidences the graphitic sp2 hybridization (pyridine carbon) in graphitic carbon nitride. Similarly, the N 1s level (Fig. 4d) shows the main component at 398.3 eV with a small component at 400.1 eV attributed to sp2 triazine rings and H–N-(C)3 assemblies, correspondingly [50]. The XPS results, therefore, show the formation of Bi2O3 in contact with graphite-like C3N4 structures. The microstructure of β-Bi2O3, g-C3N4, and 3%Bi2O3/g-C3N4 sample was determined by TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 5 ). The nanoparticles of pure β-Bi2O3 (Fig. 5a) were fairly homogeneous in shape and size. As seen in Fig. 5a, the pure Bi2O3 shows irregular agglomerates formed by rounded particles with an average diameter of 15–20 nm range. The bare g-C3N4 shows a clear graphene-resembling layered nanosheet arrangement (Fig. 5b), typically confirms the formation of g-C3N4. Some porosity noticed in the nanosheet of g-C3N4 following its mesoporous nature determined from the N2 isotherms (Fig. 2). The TEM micrographs of 3%Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite (Fig. 5c) show that Bi2O3 was well distributed on the g-C3N4. Bi2O3 is in the form of spherical nanoparticles with an average size between 16 and 21 nm. The g-C3N4 nanosheets in the composite show less aggregation compared to the pure counterpart which allows visualizing the mesoporosity of the sheets more clearly (Fig. 5c). The higher nanosheet exfoliation of g-C3N4 confirms the XRD outcomes that already showed that exfoliation was related to the higher intercalation of Bi2O3 in the stacking of g-C3N4 that facilitates its ultrasonic liquid exfoliation. The microstructure of the 3% Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite was analyzed by high-resolution TEM (Fig. 5d). As shown by HR-TEM, the composite presents lattice lines having interplanar distance (d) of 0.321 nm confirming the (201) crystallographic plane of the β-Bi2O3. It is also observed lattice planes having d of 0.281 nm indexed to the (002) of g-C3N4 [51] which fit with the previous XRD outcomes. HR-TEM of the 3.0% Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite clearly shows the close contact between the crystallographic planes (210) of β-Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 creating an obvious interface between them which approves the realization of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 junctions. The optical possessions of the synthesized powders were studied from the UV–vis DRS (Fig. 6 A). The bare β-Bi2O3 shows a defined main absorption feature at 468 nm that resembles the bandgap transition in the oxide [52]. The spectrum of the bare g-C3N4 shows a well-defined absorption shoulder at 438 nm ascribed to its intrinsic bandgap. The xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites show an obvious shift towards the visible range to the parent g-C3N4. This redshift is induced by the incidence of Bi2O3 since it becomes more intense as the concentration of Bi2O3 in the composites increases (Table 1). The shift in the absorption wavelength edge with the Bi2O3 content demonstrates that the amalgamation of Bi2O3 with g-C3N4 nanosheets forming heterojunctions contributes to enhancing the absorption. The Eg of the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites was calculated from the Tauc Plot (Fig. 6B) and its values (Table 1) decreased respect to the neat g-C3N4. Accordingly, the reduction of the Eg with the Bi2O3 content in the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites corroborates the close contact between both semiconductors in the composite [35,53]. The decrease in the Eg of the formed nanocomposites is proportional to the Bi2O3 content up to 3 molar %, while for higher loading, the Eg remains unchanged. The modification in the bandgap of the composites with the Bi2O3 loading indicates that the contacts between the oxide particles with the exterior of the g-C3N4 nanosheets are homogeneous at low loading (up to 3.0%) while the contacts do not improve at higher loading. In line with this, the HR-TEM investigation of the 3.0% Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite has proved the homogeneous distribution of the spherical Bi2O3 nanoparticles forming well-distributed interfaces with the g-C3N4 nanosheets."
10,Photocatalytic performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance The efficiency of the formed nanocomposites was studied in the generation of hydrogen from watery solutions of glycerol beneath visible light irradiation. Before the photocatalytic measurements, blank experiments confirm the absence of hydrogen production in the dark or without photocatalyst powders. The photocatalytic results (Fig. 7 A) reveals the relatively low photoefficiency of the as-prepared pure Bi2O3 and bare g-C3N4 that show hydrogen production figures of only 510 and 400 μmol g−1 respectively after 9h of irradiation time. This is in line with the low efficiency in the charge carrier recombination shown by both photocatalysts [53]. The xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites displayed improved photocatalytic activity compared with the individual Bi2O3 or g-C3N4 counterparts (Fig. 7A). The efficiency of the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites for hydrogen production depends on the Bi2O3 loading in the composite. The increase is especially significant when the Bi2O3 load is greater than 1% and reaching the maximum at 3.0% of Bi2O3.The most active nanocomposite (3.0 Bi2O3/g-C3N4) increases by 20 times the photoactivity achieved over the pristine g-C3N4 (8542 vs. 400 μmol g−1 respectively). The photoactivity results obtained over the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites demonstrated that the photoactivity of composites depends on the concentration of Bi2O3 because it determines the efficiency of the heterostructures formed between the Bi2O3 particles and the g-C3N4 nanosheets. To scrutinize the upshot of the photocatalyst content on the efficiency for the hydrogen production, catalytic tests were performed using the most active 3.0% Bi2O3/g-C3N4 sample in concentration diverse from 0.5 to 3.0 g L−1 (Fig. 8 A). The hydrogen production increases with the photocatalyst concentration until the concentration in the suspension achieves 2.5 g L−1. A higher concentration of 3.0% Bi2O3/g-C3N4 decreases the intrinsic efficiency because the increase in the number of photocatalysts particles overlaps and blocks the light penetration inside the photocatalyst suspension. The solidity of the 3.0% Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite under irradiation was demonstrated in consecutive photocatalytic test cycles in which the photocatalyst maintains its efficiency after 5 consecutive cycles (Fig. 8B)."
11,Photocatalytic efficiency versus the structure of the xBi2O3/g-C3N4,"3.3 Photocatalytic efficiency versus the structure of the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 The photocatalytic tests on the prepared samples have revealed the strong impact of the Bi2O3 loading on the improvement of the performance of the g-C3N4. The observed differences of the photoactivity of the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites must be analyzed taking into account the alterations in the photophysical and structural possessions of the nanocomposites derived from the increase in the concentration of Bi2O3. The deposition and contact of this oxide to the exterior of the g-C3N4 change the ability to absorb visible light, the capacity to generate and transport the photocarriers, and the potential of the photocarriers to produce the redox reactions involved in the photoreduction of glycerol to produce hydrogen. The variation in the performance of the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites associated with changes in the mesoporous SA could be discarded because all nanocomposites show similar SA irrespective of the Bi2O3 loading (Table 1).The light absorption of the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 samples varies with the Bi2O3 loading as the UV–vis spectra show (Fig. 6A). A diminution in the bandgap of all nanocomposites respect to the parent g-C3N4 was observed indicating a higher ability to absorb an extensive portion of the visible regime. The shrinkage in the Eg value is proportional to the Bi2O3 content up to 3.0 wt% loading, while for higher loading the bandgap remains unchanged (Table 1). The photoactivity of the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites (Fig. 7) shows parallelism with its Eg (Table 1) which indicates that a part of the expansion in the photoactivity of the nanocomposites is linked to its greater capacity to absorb a wide portion of the visible range. In addition to the aptitude to absorb visible irradiation, the spatial separation of photocarriers also theatres a critical part in the photoefficiency of the xBi2O3/g-C3N4. For this reason, the recombination of the photoexcited e−/h+ duos of prepared samples was considered by photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy (Fig. 9 A). The pure Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 show strong emission peaks at 461 and 510 nm respectively, corresponding to their bandgap electronic transitions. These strong PL peaks mean low efficiency in the separation of photo-induced charges that explains the low photoactivity of the bare Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 samples. The PL intensity is notably suppressed for the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites respect to the bare samples which indicates lower recombination processes of the photo-generated charges. The reduction in the recombination of the photoinduced charges will greatly subsidize to the improvement in the photocatalytic adeptness observed on the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites respect to the pristine g-C3N4 counterpart because there is a parallel behaviour between both parameters. The intensity of the PL emission in the nanocomposites decreases with the Bi2O3 loading, achieving the minimum intensity the sample loaded with 3.0%. In this case, as in the above investigations, the incorporation of the Bi2O3 on the composite at loading below 5.0% improves the separation of photo-charges because the low load allows the formation of homogeneous contacts between the Bi2O3 nanoparticles and the exterior of g-C3N4 that facilitates the spatial parting of the photocharges between them. Therefore the effectual parting of photogenerated h and e requires an optimum concentration of Bi2O3 for junctions [54]. Thus, a low amount of Bi2O3 formed insufficient junctions while an increase in a concentration above the optimum does not contribute to generating new junctions. The changes in the dynamics of the generation and interfacial charge transference on the xBi2O3/g-C3N4 were also monitored analyzing their photocurrent density versus irradiation time (Fig. 9B). The xBi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites exhibit enhanced transient photocurrent intensity in comparison to the bare Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 counterparts, which confirms the higher parting competence of charges in the nanocomposites. Logically, the value of the photocurrent intensity on the nanocomposites increases in parallel with the Bi2O3 content achieving the maximum for the composite loaded at 3.0%. The upsurge of the Bi2O3 above this value leads to a decrease in the photocurrent intensity, proving once again that nanocomposite with Bi2O3 amount higher than 3.0% produces less effective Bi2O3/g-C3N4 contacts for the spatial separation of the photocharges. As stated above, the Bi2O3 presence on the g-C3N4 controls the dynamics and recombination rate of the charges. In this respect, the photoactivity of nanocomposites can be improved by the construction of junctions amongst Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 that facilitates the spatial parting of e and h. The relative energy location of the valence (VB) and conduction bands (CB) can be theoretically firm using the subsequent equations [55]: (1) ECB = Xe – Ee - 0.5Eg (2) EVB = ECB + Eg as Ee is the scale-free electron energy (4.5 eV) and Xe is the electronegativity of pure β-Bi2O3 (5.95 eV) and g-C3N4 (4.72 eV). The relative CB positions of β-Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 are +0.2 and −1.14 eV, singly. The values of the VB are +2.7 and + 1.57 eV for β-Bi2O3 and g-C3N4, correspondingly. Depending on the contact degree developed amongst the Bi2O3 particles and the g-C3N4 sheets, type-II p-n junctions (Scheme 1 A) or Z-scheme (scheme 1B) could operate as mechanisms to detached the charges in the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 composites [17,18,28,32,56]. In type II p-n heterojunction (Scheme 1A), the CB of g-C3N4 is positioned at higher potential respect to that of Bi2O3, so it favors the movement of e-s starting g-C3N4 to Bi2O3. On the other side, the h pass the VB of Bi2O3 to the VB of g-C3N4. The band structure analysis of the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 composites shows that the CB potential of Bi2O3 is at the upper level to produce hydrogen by reduction of H+, therefore the mechanism based on type II p-n heterojunction is not adequate to describe the improvement in the photoproduction of H2 by the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The other possibility to clarify the enriched photoactivity of the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite is the operation of the Z-scheme mechanism (Scheme 1B) formed as a consequence of the dumpy space amongst the VB of g-C3N4 and the CB of Bi2O3. In this mechanism, the interfacial heterojunction allows the transference and combination of the e-s from the CB of Bi2O3 and the h of the VB of g-C3N4. Thus, the photogenerated e-s on the CB of g-C3N4 parade a robust reduction competence to react with H+ to form hydrogen, and the photoproduced h on the VB of Bi2O3 display an outstanding oxidation capacity to oxidize glycerol straight away or to retort with H2O to produce OH radicals to oxidize glycerol and reaction intermediates into CO2. Bi2O3/gC3N4 + hυ → Bi2O3 (h+) + gC3N4 (e−) H2O + h+ → H+ + OH● CH3H8O3 + OH● + h+→ oxidation intermediates + H2O + H+ Oxidation intermediates + OH● + h+ → … H2O + H+ … → CO2 2H+ + 2e- → H2 (g) Therefore, the Z-scheme increases the oxidation and reduction potential respect the single Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 counterparts that suggestively expand the photoactivity of the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites."
12,Conclusions,"β-Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were formed by the sonication-mixture scheme using a two-step sol-gel method. Physicochemical characterization of the β-Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites showed small nanoparticles of β-Bi2O3 homogeneously formed on the exterior of the exfoliated g-C3N4 creating interfaces between them with the formation of heterojunctions. The concentration of Bi2O3 in the nanocomposite determines the formation of β-Bi2O3/g-C3N4 heterojunctions which improves the facility of the nanocomposites to absorb longer light wavelengths and the efficiency to generate and seperate the photogenerated charges efficiently than the parent systems. The photoefficiency of the gained nanocomposites to generate H2 beneath visible light is greatly enhanced compared with bare Bi2O3 or g-C3N4 counterparts. The most active 3Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite increases by 20 times the photoactivity achieved over the pristine g-C3N4 (8542 vs 400 μmol g−1 respectively). The enhanced efficiency is recognized to the interfacial heterojunctions established between Bi2O3 and g-C3N4 that allow the transference and combination of the e from the CB of Bi2O3 with the h of the VB of g-C3N4. Accordingly, the photoproduced e at the CB of g-C3N4 unveil resilient reduction aptitude, and the h at the VB of Bi2O3 display exceptional skill for the photoreduction of glycerol under visible light."
