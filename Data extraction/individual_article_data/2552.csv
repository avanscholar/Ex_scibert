0,Introduction,"Photocatalysis on semiconductors such as TiO2 has been one of the most attracting research fields for more than three decades, mainly as a tool for water decontamination [1,2]. More recently there has been new interest in photocatalytic processes as a method to generate hydrogen from aqueous solutions containing organics (photoreforming) or directly from water (photosplitting) [3,4,41]. In some studies [5–7], deaerated conditions are adopted to avoid the presence of oxygen in the solution, which is known to capture photogenerated electrons, after the TiO2 catalyst has absorbed a proper radiation and, thus, to favor the reduction of proton ions by the electrons photoproduced. However, photocatalytic processes on metal oxides – such as TiO2, ZnO and WO3 – are poorly efficient because of the recombination reaction between positive holes and photogenerated electrons. This reaction may be limited by the deposition of some metals on the semiconductor surface, e.g. Pt, Pd, Au and Cu, whose role is that of favoring the electron transfer to protons that reduce to hydrogen atoms [8–11]. Another way to suppress the recombination reaction is adding a sacrificial organic agent that irreversibly reacts with the positive holes and is oxidized. The result of this process is the oxidation of the organic species with a stoichiometric formation of hydrogen. The sacrificial agent, or hole scavenger, may also be a water pollutant, and in these cases the generation of hydrogen combines with the decontamination of water. Many classes of organic species have been used as sacrificial agents. There is literature on the use of alcohols [12] and sugars [13] as hole scavengers. An attempt to photo-produce hydrogen in presence of Pt/TiO2 and using glycerol – a by-product of biodiesel production – as sacrificial agent has also been reported with quantum yield efficiencies and light-to-chemical energy conversion of 1.80% and 14.0%, respectively [14]. Also carboxylic acids or their conjugate bases such as formate, oxalate, EDTA, salicylic and citric acids have been employed as hole-consuming sacrificial agents in the application of photocatalysts to decontaminate heavy-metal polluted waters [7,15]. Among these, formic acid has been shown to be very effective in removing copper from waters, reducing Cu ( aq ) II species to Cu ( s ) 0 in presence of TiO2 [5,16,17]. On the other hand, copper-doped TiO2 catalysts have been found to effectively enhance hydrogen photogeneration in the UV and near-UV range of radiation [19,47,49] under irradiation with both visible and solar light [20,48]. Not only do these investigations demonstrate that copper-incorporated TiO2 photocatalysts are cost-effective and possess high hydrogen generating activity in presence of alcohols as sacrificial agents [18–20,22] but also that hydrogen production is drastically enhanced by copper-doped TiO2 systems as compared to TiO2 [19,23,27]. Tests have also been carried out to assess nano-sized photocatalysts, such as CuO/TiO2 and CuO/Al2O3/TiO2, in terms of enhancement of H2 formation. These tests show that hydrogen production by nanocatalysts, composed of three components (Al2O3, TiO2 and CuO), is approximately ten times that of pure TiO2 [21], at the optimum loading. A mesoporous TiO2 nanotube catalyst with large BET surface area has been synthesized by hydrothermal calcination and employed for simultaneous photocatalytic hydrogen production and cupric ions removal from water, using methanol as sacrificial agent [24]. The authors proved that the initial CuII/Ti ratio is critical in hydrogen production. From these studies it can be concluded that Cu species, at different oxidation states, are very useful for photocatalytic production of hydrogen gas in presence of TiO2 systems. In particular, Cu x O doping components are able to reduce the large band gap of pure TiO2 and to capture photogenerated electrons, thus impeding the recombination between electrons and holes [19,48]. However, little is known on photocatalytic hydrogen production by means of aqueous slurry mixtures of copper and TiO2 catalyst. In this paper, a new photocatalytic system is proposed to generate hydrogen by photoreforming formic acid in aqueous suspensions of copper and titanium oxide. It has been reported that in the subsystem Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr, at very low pH under UV solar simulated radiation (UVssr), copper undergoes a photocorrosive process during which hydrogen is formed when protons are reduced and zero-valent copper is oxidized to cupric ions [25]. Obviously, if the latter have the possibility to reduce to zero-valent copper again, hydrogen production can continue until there is significant proton concentration in the solution. This is the reason why TiO2 and formic acid are added to this subsystem. In fact, in the CuII/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr subsystem, under deaerated conditions and in the presence of undoped TiO2 (anatase) cupric ions can be reduced to lower oxidation states while the organic acid is oxidized releasing proton ions in solution. By means of the complete system, Cu0/TiO2/Cl−/formic acid/UVssr, at low pH, it is possible to obtain hydrogen by the oxidation of an organic species under irradiation (300–400nm). Hydrogen atoms being formed by the reduction of proton ions, pH must be low because H + + e − → 0.5 H 2 the rate of gas generation, at least in principle, might be influenced by hydrogen ionic concentration. In the complete system (Cu0/TiO2/Cl−/formic acid/UVssr) organic species photocatalytic oxidation can ensure continuous reduction of dissolved copper species to zero-valent copper, which sustains the generation of hydrogen gas (Scheme 1 ). This system can thus be seen as a device to which the solar radiation and an organic species are fed and which produces hydrogen and oxidized products. As there is little information in the literature on copper photocorrosion [25], the first part of the paper is focused on assessing to what extent copper oxidation rate and hydrogen formation depend on zero-valent copper load, pH and initial chloride ion concentration. In other words the first part of the paper aims at throwing light on the way – still unknown – the Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr subsystem works, as indicated in Scheme 1 by the dashed area. In the second part of the paper, the investigations extend to the whole system, starting from different copper initial oxidation states (0 or II) and studying also the effect of hydrogen generation of TiO2 load and formic acid concentration on the oxidation rate."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The TiO2 catalyst was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (pure anatase phase, BET specific surface area 10.7m2/g, particle diameter range: 3.6·10−2–1.78μm, average diameter 0.48μm). BET specific surface areas were measured by the single-point BET method using a Micromeritics Flow Sorb 2020 apparatus. Cupric and chloride ions were introduced in the system as cupric sulphate pentahydrate, (CuSO4·5H2O) and sodium chloride, respectively. Formic acid, copper sulphate, perchloric acid, neo-cuproine (2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline), sodium perchlorate, hydrochloric acid, sodium chloride and zero-valent copper (particle diameter range: 10–100μm) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received."
3,Photoreactor unit,"2.2 Photoreactor unit Photocatalytic runs were performed in a batch cylindrical glass jacketed reactor (250ml) with an outer diameter of 6.5cm and a height of 40cm wrapped with an aluminium foil. At the top, the reactor had two inlets for feeding reactants or gaseous streams and an outlet for withdrawing samples. The reactor was equipped with 125W (power input) high-pressure solar UV lamp (Helios Italquartz) mainly emitting at 305, 313 and 366nm enclosed in a glass sleeve, immersed in the solution in the center of the reactor. The powers of lamp (P λ ) at 366, 313 and 305nm were 4.67·10−7, 2.27·10−6 and 2.10·10−6 E/s, respectively. The reactor was thermostated at 25°C. A scheme of the experimental device was reported elsewhere [26]."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure The pH was regulated by perchloric acid and monitored by means of an Orion 420A+ pH-meter (Thermo). In each experiment, the solution was preventively purged with nitrogen to remove any dissolved oxygen that might compete with the other species (protons or cupric ions) for the reaction with electrons. During the photocatalytic runs nitrogen was continuously bubbled, at a flow rate ( Q N 2 ) of 0.3l/min, in the solution to prevent any contact with air. For each run starting from Cu0, weighted amounts of zero-valent copper were added to 280ml of pH regulated aqueous solution, containing sodium chloride at desired concentration, and the resulting suspension poured in the photoreactor. A nitrogen flow was fed into the reactor for 30min before switching on the lamp. Samples of the suspension were withdrawn from the reactor at different reaction times, filtered on filters (Millex-LCR, 0.45μm) and the filtrate was used to measure dissolved copper species. Some experimental runs were performed to assess the effect of both TiO2 and formic acid on the reactivity of the system, by adding weighted amounts of photocatalyst to the subsystem. Gaseous samples were recovered from the reactor outlet in Tedlar gas sampling bags and then introduced in the analytical device. For each run starting from CuII, proper amounts of TiO2, formic acid and sodium chloride, were added to 280ml of aqueous solution at the desired pH, containing cupric sulphate pentahydrate at the desired concentration. The resulting suspension was poured in the reactor. Nitrogen bubbling, sample collection and treatment were managed as indicated above. Some experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate obtaining experimental average standard deviations of about 4.5%."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Hydrogen concentrations ( C H 2 , μmol/l) were measured by micro-gas-chromatography (Agilent 3000A) equipped with a MS5A column and a TCD detector using argon instead of helium as carrier gas to increase the sensitivity of the system as hydrogen and helium have similar thermal conductivity. The hydrogen generation rates were thus calculated as: r H 2 = C H 2 · Q N 2 . The concentration of dissolved copper, (CuI +CuII) ions, was measured by means of a colorimetric method with an analytical kit (based on oxalic acid bis-cyclohexylidene hydrazide, cuprizone®) purchased from Macherey-Nagel. A UV/Vis spectrometer (Unicam) was used to measure dissolved copper at a wavelength of 585nm. A detection limit of 0.1mg/l was found during this investigation. The concentration of formic acid was measured by HPLC analysis. For this purpose, the HPLC apparatus (Agilent 1090) was equipped with a UV–Vis detector (λ =215nm) and a Phenomenex Rezex column (ion-exclusion column), using a mobile phase of sulphuric acid 2.5·10−3 mol/l, flowing at 0.6ml/min."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr subsystem,"3.1 Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr subsystem Fig. 1 reports the results of a run in which Cu0 (800mg/l) was suspended in an aqueous solution acidified at pH=0 by perchloric acid to which a certain amount of sodium chloride was added to have a concentration of chlorides of 1.0M when the system was irradiated by a solar UV lamp. The diagrams indicate that the concentration of dissolved copper increases following a S-shaped curve. Neither dissolved copper species accumulation nor hydrogen generation were observed in the absence of lamp irradiation (data not shown). Under these conditions, for the highest hydrogen generation rate ( r H 2 = 5.28 · 10 − 6 mol min − 1 ) the overall quantum yield (Φ overall) and light-to-chemical energy conversion (ξ) were calculated as [3] Φ overall = 2 × r H 2 moles of photons / time × 100 = 2.47 % ξ = r H 2 × ( − Δ H comb , H 2 ) ∑ λ P λ × 100 = 1.06 % where Δ H comb , H 2 (enthalpy hydrogen combustion) is 6.83·104 calmol−1 [28]. 3.1.1 Effect of chloride ions concentration Additional runs were performed at different concentrations of chloride ions (Fig. 2 ) in order to check how this parameter affects system reactivity. The diagrams show that the lower the chloride ion concentration, the lower the reactivity, until it gets almost negligible when [Cl−] approaches to zero. As for Fig. 1, an approximate correspondence between the maximum rate of hydrogen production and the highest dissolved copper concentration increase rate was recorded. No reactivity at all was observed in the absence of chlorides in the solution (full circles). From these indications it seems that chlorides, in agreement with what reported by others [25], catalyze hydrogen formation. A possible explanation of their role in terms of mechanism of reaction will be provided in the following. Decreased reactivity was also observed for chloride concentrations higher than 2.0M, which is possibly due to the formation, in these conditions, of no-photolyzable tetrachlorocuprate(I) complexes such as CuCl 4 3 − [29,30] or polynuclear cuprous complexes such as Cu 2 Cl 4 2 − , Cu 3 Cl 6 3 − and Cu 5 Cl 9 4 − as suggested by other authors [31–33]. 3.1.2 Effect of zero-valent copper load The effect of zero-valent copper load on system reactivity was studied in different runs when it was changed over a 200–800mg/l range. The results indicate that a Cu0 load increase clearly affects system reactivity, although the curves for dissolved copper ions concentration–time and hydrogen production rate–time are similar to those recorded in other experiments (Fig. 3 ). It is worth observing that the major changes were recorded between 200 and 400mg/l loads and that only moderate changes were observed with zero-valent copper load increasing from 400 to 800mg/l. 3.1.3 Effect of pH Another set of experiments was carried out changing the solution pH and starting with zero-valent copper load and chloride ions concentration of 800mg/l and 1.0M, respectively. The profiles of dissolved copper concentration and hydrogen production rate during these runs are reported in Fig. 4 . It is clear that a reduction in proton concentration, at pH increasing from 0 to 1.0, does not result in any significant decrease in system reactivity whereas a marked decrease is observed at pH=2.0. 3.1.4 Mechanism for hydrogen generation in Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr subsystem On the basis of these results, it can be hypothesized that the formation of hydrogen proceeds according to a series of reactive events (copper oxidation with electron generation, proton reduction, hydrogen atoms combination) and that, as a function of pH, initial copper load, chloride ions concentration and power of the lamp chosen, proton reduction may be the determining step for hydrogen generation. The results collected indicate that the simultaneous oxidation of Cu0 and reduction of H+ ions under UV-simulated solar radiation require the presence of Cl− ions and that reactivity is strongly dependent upon their concentration. On the other hand, no direct photoreduction of protons in presence of chloride ions was observed in the absence of zero-valent copper. In other words, only when Cu0, Cl− and H+ species are simultaneously present in the solution under UV solar simulated radiation, the system is reactive and hydrogen production is recorded. Since very long reaction times were required to achieve a complete oxidation of zero-valent copper under the conditions adopted, an experimental run with a lower initial zero-valent copper load (400mg/l) was carried out (Fig. 5 ). On the basis of the data obtained, it can be stated that the moles of hydrogen produced for a reaction time of 600min were approximately the same as those of zero-valent copper initially charged in the reactor. These findings are in agreement with those reported by other authors [25]. An attempt to explain the results collected in the first part of the investigation was done also taking into account the suggestions put forward by Eisel and Tausch [25]. They reported that by comparing the images collected by means of a scanning electronic microscope on two Cu0 samples – the first being the material as received from the seller and the second being taken during a typical photoexperiment – the formation of a black deposit on the surface of the latter was observed, which was identified as CuCl by means of X-ray diffraction measurements. On the basis of the observations collected in this investigation and of the literature [25], the following mechanism can be proposed ((1)–(10)). Under irradiation, the chloride anions adsorbed on zero-valent copper surface react with solved protons by exchanging an electron (1) Cl ads − + H aq + → h ν , Cu 0 Cl ads • + H aq , ads • (2) Cl ads • + Cu 0 → CuCl aq , ads where adsorbed chlorine radicals are capable to react with zero-valent copper to form CuCl species, while two solvated and/or adsorbed hydrogen atoms combine to produce molecular hydrogen (3) H aq , ads • + H aq , ads • → H 2 ( g ) However, according to the results collected in this study, the rate of reduction of proton ions does not seem to depend upon their concentration, in the range 0.1–1.0M, thus indicating that, in these conditions, the electron transfer from the chloride ion to the proton (1) is not a concerted process. Therefore, reaction (1) may be more conveniently substituted by (4) and (5) reactions: (4) Cl ads − → h ν , Cu 0 Cl ads • + e − slow (5) H aq + + e − → H aq , ads • fast Reaction (4) is proposed herein since no specific indications were found in the literature. Moreover, in the system, under the experimental conditions adopted, cuprous species are undoubtedly coordinated in chloro complexes such as CuCl 2 − , CuCl 3 2 − and CuCl 4 3 − [34,35] (6) CuCl aq , ads + Cl − → CuCl 2 − (7) CuCl 2 − + Cl − → CuCl 3 2 − (8) CuCl 3 2 − + Cl − → CuCl 4 3 − It has been shown that bis and tris-coordinated cuprous chloride complexes eject hydrated electrons in the aqueous solution upon absorption of UV light [36,37] (9) CuCl 2 − → h ν Cu 2 + + 2 Cl − + e − slow (10) CuCl 3 2 − → h ν Cu 2 + + 3 Cl − + e − slow the reaction (5) being considered faster than those in which the electron is generated ((9) and (10)). However, the results collected after a further decrease in protonic concentration (pH=2.0) seem also to indicate that, in these conditions, some changes happen and the electron transfer to the proton is likely to be the rate-determining step for hydrogen generation. It is important to stress that besides reaction (2), cuprous species could be also generated through the following one [33]: (11) Cu II + Cu 0 → 2 Cu I This reaction is negligible at the beginning of the process, the concentration of cupric species being zero or about zero. However, as it increases, the rate of formation of dissolved copper species grows at least until the reduction of zero-valent copper load (due to the consumption) becomes relevant. The occurrence of reaction (11) could explain the s-shaped trend of the concentration of dissolved copper species. However, for the sake of completeness, it must be considered that, for proper values of the kinetic constants, also the couple of reactions (2) and (4) can give rise the concentration trend observed. Therefore, only a detailed modeling may allow to build the most reliable reaction scheme and to better clarify some experimental observations as, for example, the correspondence between the maximum rate of hydrogen production and the highest rate of increase of dissolved copper concentration. Moreover, the reactions proposed above are consistent with a stoichiometric ratio equal to 1.0 between generated cupric ions and produced molecular hydrogen. All the data collected may be summarized through Scheme 2 . In the system investigated in the above paragraphs the formation of hydrogen is strictly related to the presence of low oxidation state copper species (Cu0 and CuI) in the reacting solution. The reactivity of the system reduces to zero when copper, initially present as Cu0, is converted in cupric ions (CuII). Based on the results of a previous investigation, the addition of TiO2 and of a sacrificial agent (formic acid, in this case) to the system could allow cupric ions to reduce to zero-valent copper [5] again. That is to say that in the presence of TiO2 and formic acid copper could act simply as a catalyst that allows for hydrogen production while the organic species oxidizes. In other words, it may be expected that, for a fixed copper load, higher amounts of hydrogen than those recorded with the first subsystem can be produced in the presence of TiO2 and formic acid due to a continue reduction of higher oxidation state copper species. In principle, two different initial experimental conditions are possible for the complete system. The first condition starts with copper in the lowest oxidation state (Cu0/Cl−/H+/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr) whereas the second one is obtained when copper is present as cupric ions (CuII/Cl−/H+/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr)."
8,Cu0/Cl−/H+/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr system,"3.2 Cu0/Cl−/H+/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr system 3.2.1 Effect of titanium dioxide load A preliminary evaluation of the effect of the addition of TiO2 photocatalyst to the Cu0/Cl−/H+/UV system was done. Cu0 and TiO2 powders with a load of 800mg/l and 500mg/l were added to an aqueous solution containing chlorides (NaCl, 1.0M) at pH=1.0. After switching the lamp on, surprisingly it was observed that neither production of hydrogen nor formation of dissolved copper were occurring (Fig. 6 ). On the other hand, experiments with lower TiO2 loads indicated that, for values as low as 100mg/l, the presence of the titanium dioxide did not exert any effect on the previously investigated system (Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr). For TiO2 loads higher than 100mg/l, a reduction of the rate of hydrogen formation was observed. In a first attempt at explaining this result, the possibility was considered that suspended TiO2 could scatter the radiation with an effect that reduces when the load decreases, as reported by others on photo-oxidation processes [38,39]. An alternative explanation is that Cu0 oxidizes giving its electrons to the photogenerated positive holes on the semiconductor whereas the CuI and CuII ions reduce by reacting with the photoelectrons, cuprous ions being capable of undergoing both oxidative and reductive reactions [24,40] (12) TiO 2 → h ν h VB + + e CB − (13) Cu ( 0 ) → h VB + Cu + → h VB + Cu 2 + (14) Cu 2 + → e CB − Cu + → e CB − Cu ( 0 ) 3.2.2 Effect of formic acid concentration The effect of formic acid as sacrificial agent in the solution was studied in further experimental runs where it was added up to a concentration of 1.0M with a starting load of zero-valent copper of 800mg/l, sodium chloride and perchloric acid both at a concentration of 0.1M but in absence of titanium dioxide (data not shown). No influence of formic acid was detected in the experimental conditions adopted. 3.2.3 Effect of both titanium dioxide and formic acid The effect of formic acid in the mixture in presence of solid TiO2 (100mg/l) was studied at the same conditions as described above, that is pH=1.0 and [NaCl] o =1.0M (Fig. 7 a,ba and b). For formic acid concentrations equal or lower than 0.05M (full squares and diamonds) a small effect was observed with respect to the system without formic acid (full circles). For concentrations of formic acid higher than 0.05M (full triangles), a marked decrease in reactivity was recorded. At the highest load of formic acid (1.0M), the system was totally unreactive: no formation of dissolved copper in solution (Fig. 7a) and no production of hydrogen were observed (Fig. 7b). That is, surprisingly, the addition of TiO2 and formic acid to the first subsystem does not result into any gain in terms of hydrogen produced and, in some conditions, renders the system completely unreactive. These observations suggest that the addition of formic acid (and TiO2) to the first subsystem has a deleterious effect on the formation of dissolved copper species and hydrogen generation. In a first attempt at explaining these data one can consider that the adsorption of formic acid and/or formate ions on zero-valent copper surface may compete with that of chloride ions thus preventing reaction (1) [42,43] from occurring. That is, the initial formation of cuprous species could be inhibited by the presence of formic acid. Moreover, it is known that the sacrificial agent utilized reacts with photo-produced positive holes [49,50] (15) HCOOH + h VB + → HCO 2 • + H + (16) HCO 2 • + h VB + → CO 2 + H + thus rendering photoelectrons, which slowly react with protons (17) e CB − + H + → H • very slow well available for cuprous/cupric ions reduction (14). Moreover, under the experimental conditions adopted, CuII and formate ions form stable metal–organic complexes such as Cu(HCO2)+, Cu(HCO2)2, Cu ( HCO 2 ) 3 − , Cu ( HCO 2 ) 4 2 − [44]. The formation of these species lowers the concentration of free CuII with a consequent limitation of the occurrence of reaction (11). Therefore, it is clear that the prompt reduction of cuprous species and its limited formation through (1) and (11) prevents also the occurrence of reactions (9) and (10) and consequently (5). These data undoubtedly indicate that the complete system starting from zero-valent copper is not a simple combination of the two subsystems (Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr and CuII/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr) as one might expect before investigating it. A complex interaction between them seems to happen resulting into an unexpected behavior."
9,CuII/Cl−/H+/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr system,"3.3 CuII/Cl−/H+/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr system 3.3.1 Effect of TiO2 load To evaluate the effect of semiconductor load, a set of runs was carried out at varying TiO2 initial load, for a fixed pH (1.0), formic acid (1.0M), chloride ion (1.0M) and CuII (5.0·10−3 M) concentrations. The results obtained for TiO2 load ranging from 20 to 300mg/l are shown in Fig. 8 . It is interesting to observe that at decreasing TiO2 load the amount of hydrogen increases (Fig. 8b) and, in particular, when the load is as low as 50mg/l the concentration of dissolved copper keeps at a constant value (Fig. 8a) and hydrogen production proceeds at a constant rate (Fig. 8b). For load of 20mg/l hydrogen is produced also for reaction time higher than 300min but with generation rate lower than that observed for 50mg/l TiO2. For higher TiO2 loads the concentration of dissolved copper and the rate of hydrogen production decrease during each run. These results may be probably due to a competition between photocatalytic reduction of cuprous species and their photolysis to generate free electrons ((9) and (10)). For high TiO2 loads, photocatalytic reduction prevails and, as discussed in the previous paragraph, in the presence of formic acid, a limited occurrence of (1) and (11) reactions is allowed. In this case, a decrease of dissolved copper species and lower rates of hydrogen generation occur as observed during the experimental runs at increasing TiO2 loads. For all the runs, the analysis carried out on samples taken at different reaction times (up to 300min) did not reveal any valuable change in the concentration of formic acid with respect to the initial one. Moreover, prolonged photocatalytic runs (up to 450min), starting from CuII at low TiO2 load (50mg/l), allowed to produce higher amounts of hydrogen than those obtained by the Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr subsystem with an equivalent quantity of zero-valent copper. For an unitary stoichiometry 1.25mmol of hydrogen is the highest quantity produced from an equivalent amount of Cu0 which is lower than 1.49mmol recorded for a reaction time of 450min for the complete system. It is clear that the surplus of hydrogen produced in this case is closely correlated with the presence of the organic species whose oxidation makes the continuous reduction of cupric ions possible. 3.3.2 Effect of formic acid concentration The effect of formic acid was studied in some runs in which it was added to an aqueous solution containing a starting concentration of cupric ions of 5.0·10−3 M and sodium chloride and perchloric acid both at a concentration of 1.0M (Fig. 9 ) for a fixed TiO2 initial load (50mg/l). Unlike the complete system in which copper was added as zero-valent species, when cupric ions were introduced in the mixture at beginning of the run, the reactivity increased as formic acid concentration increased. It was practically zero at low formic acid concentrations whereas the situation completely changed at the highest concentration value (1.0M). That is, a net production of hydrogen was observed when formic acid concentration achieved the value of 1.0M. It can be hypothesized that at low formic acid concentrations and low TiO2 loads (50mg/l), few photoelectrons only are available for dissolved copper species reduction. Only at high concentrations of the organic species this situation changes making hydrogen generation possible. Interestingly the maximum H2 production rate observed in this case and estimated to be about 5.0·103 μmolH2 h−1 g−1, is higher than the value obtained starting from 10% glucose (0.5M) through the enzymatic route [45] at room temperature but lower than that obtained through catalytic aqueous phase reforming of glucose in a process carried out at 498K [46]. As a consequence, the system proposed in this paper can successfully compete with systems operating at room temperature."
10,Conclusions,"A new photocatalytic system was proposed to generate hydrogen by the reforming of an organic species. The complete system (copper/TiO2/Cl−/formic acid/UVssr) results from the coupling of two subsystems, Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr and CuII/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr. The investigations carried out during the present work demonstrated that within the first subsystem the generation of hydrogen is possible only when Cu0, Cl−, H+ species are simultaneously present and under irradiation. Moreover, it was demonstrated that subsystem reactivity depends on initial chloride concentration, zero-valent copper load and pH values. The addition of a TiO2 load to this system significantly decreases its reactivity. In particular, only for TiO2 loads as low as 100mg/l, the hydrogen production rate is not influenced by the solid. The results for the complete system starting from zero-valent copper indicate that it is not a simple combination of the two subsystems (Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr and Cu0/TiO2/formic acid/UVssr). A complex interaction between them seems to happen resulting into an unexpected behavior. That is, the addition of TiO2 and formic acid to the first subsystem does not result into any gain in terms of hydrogen produced and, in some conditions, renders the system completely unreactive. On the other hand, when the complete system starting from cupric ions is used, for low TiO2 loads and a formic acid concentration of 1.0M, hydrogen production is observed also for prolonged reaction times. In these experimental conditions, a surplus of hydrogen production is recorded with respect to the Cu0/Cl−/H+/UVssr subsystem with the same Cu0 starting load and in absence of TiO2 photocatalyst and sacrificial agent."
