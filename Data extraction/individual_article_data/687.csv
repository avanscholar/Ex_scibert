0,Introduction,"The increasing price of fossil fuels coupled with the issues of increasing global energy demand, environmental pollution and climate change have prompted interest in alternative energy resources [1,2]. The elevating global energy demands together with the challenges of greenhouse gas emissions and waste management issues have stimulated interest in the conversion of organic waste residues to biofuels, biochemicals and bioproducts [3,4]. Waste organic biomass can be converted into process-specific liquid and gaseous biofuels (e.g. bio-oil, biodiesel, bioethanol, biobutanol, biohydrogen, biomethane, syngas, bio-jet fuels, etc.) through thermochemical pathways (e.g. pyrolysis, liquefaction, gasification, transesterification, etc.) or biological pathways (e.g. enzymatic saccharification, fermentation, anaerobic digestion, etc.) [5]. The thermochemical conversion processes offer several advantages including the ability to handle different types of feedstocks, high-energy efficiency as well as faster reaction and conversion rates, whereas the biological conversion processes, although ecofriendly, typically require a longer reaction time depending on the microbial growth conditions and enzymatic saccharification rate [5]. The hydrothermal conversion process is regarded as a thermochemical biomass conversion approach that involves the thermal disintegration of organics in hot compressed water to produce combustible gases, hydrochar, bio-crude oil and other liquid effluents [6]. Examples of popular hydrothermal conversion technologies are hydrothermal gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrothermal carbonization. It should be noted that the prominent operating conditions (i.e. temperature, pressure, feed concentration, reaction time, catalyst and reactor configuration) impact the conversion process as well as the yield and composition of the desired products. Hydrothermal gasification is a biomass-to-gas conversion process, which uses subcritical or supercritical water as its reaction medium to generate hydrogen-rich syngas. The fluid phases of water (i.e. subcritical and supercritical water) are determined by two intensive properties i.e. temperature and pressure. Subcritical water occurs near or below the critical temperature (374 °C) and critical pressure (22.1 MPa) of water, whereas supercritical water exists beyond the critical temperature and pressure of water [7,8]. The thermo-physical properties (e.g. density, dielectric constant, viscosity, ionic product) of water exhibits a dramatic variation enabling water to behave like a green solvent, catalyst and reaction medium to simultaneously improve mass transfer and reaction rates [9]. Since the pioneering work of using supercritical water (SCW) for hazardous waste treatment by Modell [10], a plethora of research has been done deploying its major applications in gasification [9,11], oxidation [12], incineration [13] and fuel upgrading [14]. SCW has been applied for gasification of model compounds such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin [15–20], lignocellulosic biomass [21–23], microalgae [24,25], sewage sludge [26,27], cattle manure [28–30], food waste [31,32], waste cooking oil [33], petrochemical residues [34–37], organic acids and alcohols [38–40] as well as other heterogeneous organic wastes [41–43]. Owing to the complex mechanisms of SCW gasification, its kinetics and the underlying complex hydrothermal reaction pathways are least understood. Such information is necessary for process optimization, efficient reactor design, scale-up, techno-economic analysis, lifecycle assessment, heat recovery and thermal efficiency. In such scenarios, modeling and optimization of SCW gasification processes can provide insights and new knowledge about its phenomenon, mechanisms, reaction pathways and thermodynamics. Furthermore, these models are useful in the prediction of the performance of SCW gasification processes before the actual operation and experimentation. The experimental literature on the thermodynamic modeling [23,39,44–47] and reaction kinetics [41,48–50] of SCW gasification appear to be scarce and scattered. To the best of our knowledge, a systematic review of different optimization and modeling strategies applicable to SCW gasification of biomass is not available in the literature. Such information could be extremely valuable for fundamental and applied experimentation, application and commercialization of hydrothermal gasification. Therefore, the objective of this study is to comprehensively review the different strategies that could be applied for the modeling and optimization of process parameters during SCW gasification of waste biomass."
1,Hydrothermal gasification,"Water above its critical temperature and critical pressure is known as supercritical water. On the contrary, subcritical water exists when the pressure is above its saturation value while its temperature could be either near or below critical values. SCW exhibits high mass transfer and improved miscibility of the organic solvent because of its unique thermo-physical properties. The density, ionic product, viscosity and dielectric constant of water at supercritical conditions show some special characteristics that facilitate its ability to effectively hydrolyze complex organic substrates. A decline in the density of water from 1000 kg/m3 at ambient conditions to 322 kg/m3 at critical conditions leads to a subsequent drop in its dielectric constant from 80 to 2 ( Fig. 1). Hence, water behaves like a non-polar solvent to enhance its solubility in gases, organic compounds and hydrocarbons [11]. Besides, the initial elevation in the ionic product of water at subcritical conditions followed by a rapid drop at supercritical conditions suggests that water could behave as a base or acid catalyst because of the increased concentration of OH– and H3O+ ions. The reaction routes of hydrothermal gasification of biomass are less understood, owing to the complexity of the thermo-physical properties of SCW, biomass properties (i.e. organic and elemental composition, particle size, structural chemistry, etc.), the interplay of process parameters (i.e. temperature, pressure, feed concentration, reaction time, etc.), reactor geometry (i.e. fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, circulating-bed, batch, continuous, stirred tank, etc.), applied catalysts, etc. [7–9,11,51]. The typical reaction routes in SCW gasification dominated solely by the thermo-physical properties of SCW can be described by the ionic and free radical mechanisms ( Fig. 2). The free radical (•OH) mechanism occurs at high temperatures (>500 °C) while the ionic mechanism (H+ and OH–) is dominant at subcritical temperatures [21]. The decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass begins with the initial hydrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin into their monomeric compounds. Cellulose and hemicellulose monomers undergo secondary reactions to produce furfurals and hydroxymethylfurfural while lignin produces phenols and alcohols [20]. These intermediate compounds are further decomposed into gaseous products at high temperatures while hydrochar and tar are produced at lower temperatures. The produced gas reacts with one another through several reactions such as steam reforming, water-gas shift, methanation, Boudouard and hydrogenation depending on the reaction temperature, pressure, feed concentration and reaction time [8,51]. The products obtained from hydrothermal gasification include syngas, hydrochar and liquid effluents. Syngas consists of gaseous products such as hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6) and C2+ gases [7,8]. After conditioning, the syngas could be used as a substitute for gaseous fossil fuels for heat and power generation or converted to liquid fuels (i.e. green diesel, higher alcohols and hydrocarbons) through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [51]. Syngas can also be used in fuel cells or converted into ethanol by using either mesophilic or thermophilic microorganisms via syngas fermentation [52]. Syngas can be used to produce jet fuels or aviation turbine fuels through synthetic oil upgrading in the presence of a multifunctional catalyst [53]. Compared to other biomass conversion technologies, hydrothermal techniques can process biomass with high moisture while eliminating the requirement of biomass drying, thereby lowering the process expenditures [8]. Less coke and tars are produced during hydrothermal gasification because of the unique dissolution properties of water. Syngas produced from hydrothermal gasification is typically free from gaseous impurities and pressurized [11]. Hence, they usually do not require further processing and can lower compression costs. Despite the promising aspects of SCW gasification, there exist some technical challenges such as the high cost of H2 produced from hydrothermal gasification compared to that obtained from the reforming of fossil fuels [54,55]. Another major issue in SCW gasification is the selection of an appropriate reactor material, which can withstand harsh reaction conditions (i.e. high temperatures and pressures), corrosion due to salt precipitation and prevent heat losses while allowing heat recovery [56]. Some of these challenges hinder the commercial application of the SCW gasification technology. The overall process economics, challenges of reactor corrosion, reactor plugging due to char and tar formation, high-pressure risks and massive waste heat generation are some of the bottlenecks of hydrothermal gasification technology, which prevent it from being commercialized [51]. Since SCW gasification is perceived to be too expensive for biorefineries, only feedstocks that require a very high disposal cost are considered as feasible feed materials [9]. Besides, the high-pressure and high-temperature requirements of the SCW gasification process ensure that potential risks such as injuries, explosion, bad odor by incomplete gasification and noise of pumps are inevitable [9]. Some of these challenges of hydrothermal gasification could be potentially addressed, such as the use of a fluidized-bed reactor to eliminate reactor plugging [28], multifunctional catalysts to reduce process temperature [57], using brine to remove precipitated salts and prevent reactor plugging and corrosion [58], and advanced reactor design for reusing the waste heat via the polygeneration of synthetic natural gas with combined heat and power [59]. The high process cost of hydrothermal gasification can be compensated upon its integration with other conversion technologies and byproduct utilization to achieve a circular economy."
2,Modeling of hydrothermal gasification,"Modeling a conversion process can help understand the reaction phenomena and predict the behavior of the overall conversion system. Therefore, a lucid understanding of different models is important for process optimization, kinetics, scale-up or process modification. The modeling of SCW gasification systems can be achieved through thermodynamic, kinetic, computational fluid dynamics and process models, the merits and demerits of which are summarized in Table 1."
3,Thermodynamic modeling,"3.1 Thermodynamic modeling The application of thermodynamic models in hydrothermal gasification can help to predict the yield and composition of gas products (Table 1), which is important for reactor design, unit operations, process optimization, energy recovery, techno-economic analysis and lifecycle assessment [20,45]. In the field of hydrothermal gasification, thermodynamic models are generally applied for the prediction of thermodynamic equilibrium, which represents the state in which a system does not change its composition over time. Equilibrium of a system is a point when all the kinetics constraints are removed. Ideally, this condition would be reached when time tends to infinite. Thermodynamic equilibrium models can be grouped into two main categories: non-stoichiometric and stoichiometric models. The stoichiometric approach involves the explicit definition of a system of chemical reactions converting reactants into products, while non-stoichiometric models only need the definition of a set of chemical compounds that are expected at equilibrium. Despite the two classes of models have a radically different mathematical implementation, it can be proved that, if certain conditions are met, they are equivalent in terms of results [60]. The stoichiometric approach involves defining a series of independent reactions comprising different species present in SCW gasification products. For each of these reactions, it is thus possible to calculate an equilibrium constant, which is a function of the equilibrium concentration of each chemical species, and that can be related to other thermodynamic properties (e.g. temperature and pressure) through the standard chemical potential. Therefore, by writing all these mathematical relations, along with element conservation equations, a system of algebraic equations is obtained, whose solution allows calculating the equilibrium composition. A detailed explanation of the implementation of stoichiometric models can be found elsewhere [60]. The effect of pressure during SCW gasification is mainly due to thermodynamic considerations regarding the nature of the gaseous products. High pressures drive the equilibrium towards lower moles of gaseous products, thus favoring CH4 production instead of H2. Moreover, increasing the pressure could also lead to higher conversion of organics during SCW gasification due to higher density and enhanced dissolution ability of water. In a stoichiometric approach, Letellier et al. [61] considered seven independent reactions such as Boudouard, water-gas shift, methanation, carbon oxidation, alcohol hydrolysis and intermediates decomposition (Eqs. (1)–(7)). The thermodynamic predictions were compared with experimental data obtained from the SCW gasification of glucose and methanol. The model was observed to fit the experimental results obtained from the literature. Boudouard reaction: (1) C + C O 2 ↔ 2 CO Water-gas shift reaction: (2) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 Methane formation: (3) C + 2 H 2 ↔ CH 4 Carbon oxidation: (4) C + O 2 ↔ CO 2 Alcohol hydrolysis: (5) C 6 H 5 OH + 5 H 2 O ↔ 6 CO + 8 H 2 Intermediates decomposition: (6) C H 3 COOH ↔ 2 CO + 2 H 2 (7) C H 3 CHO + H 2 O ↔ 2 CO + 3 H 2 Biomass conversion: (8) C H x O y + 1 − Z H 2 O ↔ CO + 1 − Z + Y 2 H 2 CO methanation: (9) CO + 2 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O In subsequent work, Marias et al. [62] employed the stoichiometric thermodynamic approach to predict the product yields from SCW gasification of vinasse (an aqueous residue from alcohol industries) and performed energy analysis. The proposed model was able to simultaneously predict the heating values of the SCW gasification products. The equilibrium assumption and Peng-Robinson equation of state were applied in the estimation of the mass enthalpy and fugacity of the reacting media compounds. The authors noted that the SCW gasification process could operate without high-energy requirements upon the introduction of an oxidizing agent into the reactor (i.e. autothermal operation). Another example of the stoichiometric model can be found in a work by Castello and Fiori [63]. The authors described SCW gasification by making use of only three reactions such as biomass conversion into CO and H2 (Eq. (8)), water-gas shift (Eq. (2)) and CO methanation (Eq. (9)). Despite the extremely reduced number of chemical reactions, the calculated gas composition was found to be the same as with other approaches validated against experimental data. The authors observed that when biomass is composed of C, H and O, only five gaseous species could be expected at equilibrium in appreciable amounts such as H2, CH4, CO, CO2 and H2O. Along with the biomass feed, there could be six gaseous species, allowing the formulating of a maximum of three independent reactions with greatly reduced computational effort. It is important to note that Eqs. (1)–(7) are general stoichiometric equations. Besides, all the three models refer to any generic biomass even when a biomass conversion reaction (such as Eq. (8)) is not explicitly included. In this case, the composition of a specific feedstock enters into the mass conservation equations of the single organic elements (i.e. C, H and O), which are a part of the model as well. The stoichiometric thermodynamic models do not necessarily describe the actual chemistry of the system, but they require the actual number of independent reactions. Although stoichiometric models result in a relatively simple mathematical formulation (i.e. algebraic systems), they have not been widely utilized in the literature. The preferred approach to thermodynamic modeling is represented by the non-stoichiometric approach. This kind of model is based on the fact that the equilibrium composition of the system corresponds to a minimum of the system’s Gibbs energy. To set a non-stoichiometric model, it is necessary to define a list of chemical species that are expected at equilibrium. Then, the model needs to calculate which distribution of the defined chemical compounds allows reaching the minimum Gibbs energy, provided that mass conservation is respected. From a mathematical point of view, a non-stoichiometric model is a non-linear constrained minimization problem, which can be solved numerically using commercial software (e.g. MatLab, Aspen Plus, etc.). The non-stoichiometric method is widely used due to its flexibility and the fact that it prevents the omission of important reactions [23]. One of the first reported non-stoichiometric models in the literature was proposed by Tang and Kitagawa [44]. The model was used to predict gaseous product yield and composition, as well as to investigate the influence of reaction parameters on the product distribution. Their results indicated that high temperature and low feed concentration favor H2 yield. Several subsequent works have described different non-stoichiometric models for the hydrothermal gasification of a large number of feedstocks, such as organic model compounds [64], crude glycerol [65,66], microalgae [67] and agro-food residues [68]. These studies explored different equations of state or specific numerical techniques to reduce computational time. Although reactions under supercritical conditions are generally conducted in a homogeneous environment, it is still possible to have products in different phases, e.g. solid char. A two-phase model was proposed by Castello and Fiori [45], who presented a model featuring 22 compounds and where a solid phase in equilibrium with the supercritical phase was accounted for. Subsequently, Yakaboylu et al. [69,70] adopted a multi-phase model to predict the fate of other elements present in the biomass (e.g. P, S, Si, etc.) and to observe their partition among the different phases. Louw et al. [43] applied the non-stoichiometric thermodynamic approach to predict gas yield and composition during the hydrothermal gasification of paper waste sludge. The authors compared the prediction results with the experimental values. The gas yield and composition obtained from hydrothermal gasification differed from the experimental values. A recent study by Okolie et al. [23] also applied the non-stoichiometric approach based on used the Gibbs energy minimization method to evaluate H2 yield from the hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw and flax straw. Their experimental results exhibited a deviation from model predictions ( Fig. 3). The authors attributed the deviation in the experimental and model prediction results due to the following reasons: (i) The presence of a temperature gradient in the batch reactor used for hydrothermal gasification. (ii) The absence of mixing and agitation in the reactor. (iii) A probable requirement of longer reaction by the batch reactor to attain equilibrium. Therefore, kinetic and mass transfer constraints hamper reaching the equilibrium and thus model predictions often deviate considerably from experimental results. To reduce this bias, some corrections could be added. This strategy was first adopted by Yan et al. [71] for the modeling of the hydrothermal gasification of glucose, where they introduced carbon conversion efficiency to correct model results in the presence of non-equilibrium char. Subsequently, Yakaboylu et al. [72] introduced the concept of constrained equilibrium to predict local instead of global equilibrium conditions. They found out that this strategy of modeling can predict final concentration with much less experimental data than a kinetic model, thus being a promising concept. In summary, several thermodynamic models have been proposed to predict gas yields and composition during hydrothermal gasification of biomass. Although they do not give any information on the time needed to achieve equilibrium and sometimes predicted data do not have perfect matching with experimental results, thermodynamic models are still very important. Indeed, they represent a handful of tools for an initial evaluation of the process, making it possible to estimate, apart from the equilibrium gas composition, also the exothermicity or endothermicity of the process and the distribution of the products among the phases. Notably, they only require a few, widely available parameters to be run. Thermodynamic models are often implemented in more complex process models, where they are utilized to simulate the SCW gasification reactor as a unit operation."
4,Kinetic modeling,"3.2 Kinetic modeling Kinetic models describe the composition of syngas as a function of temperature and residence time, which is one of the key limitations of the thermodynamic equilibrium models. With the help of a kinetic model, it is possible to predict the evolution of the system over time and, therefore, calculate the dynamic mass and energy balances. This is fundamental to design reactors and equipment in general. The development of accurate kinetic equations for SCW gasification of biomass requires determining the reaction pathway and mechanism. However, this can be quite difficult due to the intrinsic high complexity of biomass feedstock and the formation of many intermediate degradation products at variable temperatures, reaction times, feed concentrations, as well as catalysts type and loading [32]. Most of the kinetics models in SCW gasification are focused on calculating the kinetic parameters and predicting the total feedstock conversion. A few researchers have also explored the prediction of syngas yield and composition, which is crucial for practical applications [73]. Many works in the literature deal with the hydrothermal gasification of model compounds. This choice allows reducing the complexity of the system, yet obtaining data that could be extended to the real biomass case. Chuntanapum and Matsumura [74] studied the char formation mechanism of glucose during SCW gasification and compared the results with experimental values obtained from the gasification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF). Two kinetics models i.e. first-order and nth-order were used to explain the glucose char formation based on experimental measurements of char yield. The authors observed a difference in the char formation mechanism of glucose and 5-HMF in a batch reactor. The difference was attributed to the co-presence of other glucose decomposition products. Their nth-order model was able to explain the effect of glucose concentration on char formation. Castello and Fiori [75] studied the hydrothermal gasification of methanol by adapting kinetic models based on elementary reactions, originally conceived for combustion or oxidation. Their analysis highlighted the importance of certain reactions, such as water-gas shift reaction and CO methanation, whose kinetic description should be improved. Several authors have used the lumped first-order kinetic model to predict the gas yield and composition during hydrothermal gasification. The lumped method is mostly used when it is extremely intricate to represent all the intermediate products involved in SCW gasification reactions [76]. Furthermore, the authors reported that the use of the lumped method is mostly concerned with modeling individual gaseous products rather than the identification of the intermediate byproducts. In the lumped method, all intermediates involved are lumped together as a single product and the gaseous products are assumed to originate from the decomposition of intermediate products [49]. Resende and Savage [49] proposed the gasification kinetics of cellulose and lignin using the lumped first-order model to fit the experimental results. The proposed kinetic model was able to predict gas yield and composition at different biomass loadings. Besides, the model predictions also showed a good fit with the thermodynamic equilibrium values obtained using the Gibbs free energy minimization method. Guan et al. [76] used the lumped first-order kinetics method to investigate the kinetics of hydrothermal gasification of algae. The proposed model was able to predict the gas yield accurately. Furthermore, the model also predicted the influence of water density and biomass loadings accurately. Jin et al. [73] used the lumped first-order method to propose the kinetics of lignite gasification in SCW. The model focused on the yields of H2, CO, CH4 and CO2. The predicted values were in accordance with the experimental results obtained from a micro-quartz tube reactor and equilibrium values obtained from the Gibbs free energy minimization method. Yakaboylu et al. [77] proposed an integrated decomposition and gasification kinetic model to understand the carbon gasification efficiency and gas yields from the hydrothermal gasification of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and proteinaceous compounds in subcritical and supercritical water. The results of the model were in accordance with the experimental values obtained from a continuous flow reactor. Guan et al. [78] studied the kinetics of phenol gasification in SCW over a Ru/CeO2 catalyst by using two reaction pathways, i.e. carbon gasification to produce H2-rich syngas and the formation of coke and char. The results of the kinetics model showed a good fit with the experimental values as shown in Fig. 4. The experiments were performed in a stainless steel mini-batch reactor. Although the lumped first-order model is effective in predicting gas yield and composition during hydrothermal gasification of selected biomass substrates, it is cannot fit the SCW behavior of coal and a variety of real biomass materials [79]. For solid biomass gasified in SCW, the process conditions are dependent on the structure and distribution of the pores within the feedstock [80]. Moreover, the porous medium is known to change its structure including its size and shape during gasification. These changes influence the mass transport within the particles, which in turn affect the reaction rate [80]. The random pore model is suitable for fluid-solid reactions because it permits random pore size distribution in the reacting solid materials [79]. The model also assumes that the reaction is carried out in a random pore structure and described by the total surface area, pore length and pore volume. Therefore, some authors have proposed the use of random pore models (RPM) to describe the SCW gasification process of highly carbonaceous materials. Jin et al. [79] showed that the RPM approach can fit the batch reaction experimental results obtained from a bamboo char gasification model when compared with other models such as homogeneous and unreacted core models. Vostrikov et al. [81] used the RPM approach and non-reactive core model in describing SCW gasification of coal. It is important to note that the RPM method must be modified when the elemental distribution or those with the catalytic effect is non-uniform [79]. Zhang et al. [82] proposed a modified RPM approach for SCW gasification of char. The model showed a better fit than the traditional RPM approach. Chen et al. [32] proposed a semi-empirical modified RPM approach to study the SCW gasification kinetics of food waste. The model showed a good fit with the experimental values. Tushar et al. [83] demonstrated a kinetic model based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) mechanism and a mechanistic model based on the Eley-Rideal (ER) approach to describe the catalytic SCW gasification of glucose. The authors used the experimental data from the literature to fit the kinetics models. The models were in accordance with the values reported in the literature. Another recent work by Tushar et al. [84] used the Eley-Rideal (ER) approach to model the hydrothermal gasification of bio-crude oil. The dissolution of oxygenated hydrocarbon was found to be the rate-determining step. In summary, kinetics models provide information about the reaction rates for different possible reaction pathways during SCW gasification. Several kinetics models proposed in the literature have been observed to show reasonable agreement with experimental values. Kinetics parameters are important for the design and predict the product distribution with time during the SCW gasification process. Through the kinetics models, it is possible to show which reaction route or pathway is responsible for the production of a particular gaseous product. For example, reactions such as methanation and water-gas shift occur during SCW gasification. The former produces CH4. However, it is unsure if all the CH4 derived from the product yield is obtained from methanation reaction or other reaction routes. Such questions could be answered with the aid of reliable kinetic models in combination with CFD."
5,Computational fluid dynamics modeling,"3.3 Computational fluid dynamics modeling Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is based on fluid mechanics principles and the use of numerical methods to solve fluid flow equations [85]. The model can simulate fluid (i.e. liquid and gas) interactions whose surfaces are defined by a specific boundary condition. CFD modeling has been widely used to simulate several biomass conversion processes such as thermochemical gasification [86], pyrolysis [87–89] and liquefaction [90–92]. However, it is rare to find the application of CFD models to study fluid behavior during hydrothermal gasification. The CFD approach can provide a clear understanding of the SCW gasification process and reactor upgrading or retrofitting. However, CFD modeling encounters certain challenges in hydrothermal gasification because of the complex transport and thermodynamic properties of subcritical and supercritical water. It is also difficult to select the most reliable turbulent heat-transfer models [93]. During supercritical fluid flow (such as SCW), non-uniform heat flux distribution is inherent, which could lead to an uneven distribution of the internal flow and temperature [94]. Moreover, the flow of supercritical fluids and the corresponding heat transfer mechanism are completely different from that of a conventional fluid. For supercritical fluid, a small change in temperature within the critical region could produce a large change in the thermophysical properties (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a change in the thermophysical properties coupled with the buoyancy effects could lead to severe heat transfer deterioration and high heat flux [95]. The difficulties in dealing with high heat fluxes and turbulent flows simultaneously makes it challenging to select the appropriate turbulence and heat transfer models. Goodwin and Rorrer [96] used a CFD model to simulate SCW gasification of xylose in a microchannel reactor and study the influence of residence time on the gasification process. The model suggested that the endothermic gasification of xylose has minimal influence on the reaction temperature. Furthermore, the average fluid residence time was found to be dependent on the reacting fluid temperature and reactor configuration. The CFD model predicted the gas composition accurately except for the CH4 yield. Azadi et al. [97] proposed a semi-theoretical model based on the numerical simulations of the SCW gasification process. The model was used to evaluate the heating time constant as a function of process conditions in an SCW gasification reactor. The authors also studied the effects of various process parameters on the heating length of the SCW gasification reactor and heating time. The heating length was observed to be sensitive to flow rate while the external temperature and pressure showed little influence on the heating time constant. The heating time required for a feedstock to attain the desired temperature is a crucial factor when considering tar and char formation in an SCW gasification reactor. These byproducts could cause reactor plugging, and their occurrences signify incomplete gasification and a loss of carbon. Char and tar formation during SCW gasification could also affect the operational stability and process efficiency. Sinaǧ et al. [98] observed an increase in tar formation when the feedstock material was gasified at moderate temperatures for longer reaction times. However, a short heating time minimizes tar and char formation. Such observations can prompt future research studies on numerical modeling of char formation during SCW gasification. The accurate prediction of the amount of char produced during the SCW gasification process is important for process scale-up and techno-economic analysis. Yoshida and Matsumura [99] applied CFD simulation to study the deposition of char particles during glucose oxidation in SCW using H2O2 without any feasible chemical reactions. Char particles with a size greater than 20 µm were observed to precipitate at the bottom of the reactor. Recently, Fan and Jin [100] used the CFD model to show that high temperatures favor complete gasification and char conversion during the SCW gasification process. Yukananto et al. [101] proposed a CFD model to predict the char and gas formation during SCW gasification of glucose. The effects of pre-heated water temperature and flow rate on the char formation were studied to provide insights into char production and suppression mechanism. The char and gas yields predicted from CFD models showed good agreement with experimental results. Furthermore, it was observed that mixing of the feedstock with water pre-heated at 50 °C caused a significant increase in the char yield. On the other hand, a reduction in the flow rate of pre-heated water also led to an increase in char yield. Challenges such as salt precipitation and feed mixing during SCW gasification are major bottlenecks of the process. Salt precipitation could lead to reactor plugging or act as catalysts in certain cases. Kruse et al. [58] proposed a salt-water system to sequester salts while preventing reactor plugging. Reimer et al. [102] proposed an SCW oxidation concept whereby cold water is directly injected into the system to dissolve the salts leading to their subsequent removal. Although CFD models have proven successful in modeling biomass gasification and char formation during SCW gasification, its application in modeling and prediction of salt precipitation during SCW gasification is scarce in the literature. Compared to the classical application of CFD for the modeling of single-phase and multiphase (i.e. gas and liquid) flows, its application for SCW gasification processes presents a broad range of complex modeling challenges with the need to incorporate extra flow physics. Some of these include the thermodynamic properties of the process, turbulent heat-transfer models, kinetic models, particle handling and four-way particle-fluid/particle-particle coupling in Lagrangian-Eulerian reference frames [93]. The kinetic models are usually incorporated in the models to aid the prediction of gas yields and evaluate the physical properties of the fluids at a supercritical state [103]. In continuous SCW gasification reactors, the strategies used for mixing water and the reagent is very important for the optimization of mixing rate and minimizing char formation in the preheater. Two mixing strategies have been widely reported in the literature i.e. mixing water with the reagents at room temperature before heating the mixture (pre-critical injection) or heating the water to the supercritical state before injecting the mixture (post-critical injection) [104]. Although the post-critical injection of the reagent is advantageous in terms of the reduction in char formation, a clear understanding of the char formation mechanism in the preheater is still required for the design of a mixer, preheater and process optimization. Numerical simulations are also used in the practical design of a mixer considering the complex thermo-physical properties of SCW. To study the effects of mixing rates and their relationship with chemical kinetic rates in SCW gasification the turbulence-chemistry interaction model is used [56]. Examples of such models include the Eddy dissipation model or the eddy-break-up model. Tiwari et al. [103] used the turbulence-chemistry interaction model based on the delayed detached Eddy simulation to model and optimize the mixing and decomposition of an organic compound in SCW. Their results showed reasonable agreement with experimental values. The fluid dynamics community has witnessed extensive developments in commercial CFD software for tackling the aforementioned complexities, some of which include Ansys Fluent (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, USA), Ansys CFX (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, USA), Simcenter STAR-CCM+ (Siemens Industry Software Inc., Plano, USA) and COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL, Inc., Burlington, USA), OpenFOAM (The OpenFOAM Foundation Ltd, London, UK), etc. Table 2 summarizes some remarks on these CFD software programs for the modeling of complex multiphase flow processes. Although research studies that comparatively analyze the differences in these tools (via sound computational experiments) are scarce, the summary presented in Table 2 highlights some key insights to guide the tool selection and extending their application to SCW gasification processes. Despite the outlined capabilities and limitations of these CFD tools, it is worth emphasizing that experimental validation is inevitable irrespective of the software chosen for the problem at hand. Furthermore, software interoperability and user interface are important features to help enable increased prediction accuracy of experimental results. A classic example of this is the application of the computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) models. In such models, both fluid flow and particle flow simulations are implemented using different tools coupled together. Given the high computational cost usually attributed to long calculation times associated with these procedures, parallel and graphics processing unit (GPU) computing are important components of these tools, which can be significantly explored to reduce the time requirements."
6,Process modeling,"3.4 Process modeling Compared to thermodynamic modeling approaches, process modeling provides insights about an entire hydrothermal gasification process by simulating the behavior and performance of each equipment and unit operation in a processing plant. This is valuable for process optimization and techno-economic analysis. Process modeling requires specialized software such as Aspen Plus (Aspen Technology, Inc., Massachusetts, USA), which is a problem-oriented input program to simulate an entire chemical process. It facilitates the development of small and complex reactions with built-in property data banks containing different stream properties. Fiori et al. [108] performed process simulation for SCW gasification of substrates such as glycerol, microalgae, sewage sludge, grape marc and phenol to assess H2 production and energetic self-sustainability of the process. Their simulation results indicated that a minimum of about 15–25 wt% feedstock concentration is required for the process to be energetically self-sustainable. Moreover, for an SCW gasification reactor operating at 500 °C, 30 MPa and 10 wt% feed concentration, the calculated thermal energy required for the microalgae process is about 0.6 MJ. Ortiz et al. [65] used AspenPlus™ for process simulation of SCW gasification of glycerol. The predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state was used to study the influence of process parameters on H2 yield. The authors reported that pressure did not influence H2 yield during the SCW gasification of glycerol. However, temperature affected the H2 yields. The maximum yield of H2 was obtained at 900 °C with 1 mol% of glycerol feed concentration. Process modeling has also been used to investigate the integration of SCW gasification technology with other biomass conversion processes and evaluate their economic feasibility. Wan [109] proposed an integrated process comprising of the SCW gasification unit and the thermochemical gasification unit to produce clean syngas for advanced applications such as the solid oxide fuel cells. The process, modeled using AspenPlus™ comprised of an SCW gasification reactor, mixer, separator, gasification unit and expander as shown in Fig. 5. The influence of various operating parameters (i.e. pressure, reactor inlet temperature and the ratio of tars-to-SCW) on the SCW gasification reactor outlet temperature and product composition were studied. The results indicated that the H2 and CO yields are enhanced by increasing the SCW gasification reactor inlet temperature. On the other hand, decreasing the inlet temperature favored the H2/CO ratio. Moreover, reducing the pressure enhanced both the H2/CO ratio and their individual yields. Besides, a lower tar-to-SCW ratio improved H2 yield and reduced CO yield. Ondze et al. [110] simulated three different scenarios (i.e. production of H2 and CH4 and their co-generation) during the SCW gasification of biomass using process engineering software i.e. ProSimPlus (version 3.5.18) (ProSim SA, Labège, France). ProSimPlus helps in complex calculations of mass and energy balance for a broad spectrum of steady-state industrial processes. The SCW gasifier was simulated with experimental results obtained during the gasification of glucose [110]. The authors noted that all the scenarios require external heat supply systems except for the co-generation. Furthermore, the minimum heat required was sensitive to the reactor temperature. In another study, Cao et al. [111] proposed a conceptual design that integrates the pulping process with SCW gasification of black liquor for H2 production using AspenPlus™. To minimize the energy consumption of the pulping process, a combination of high-pressure and low-pressure steams, H2 and electric power were supplied to the process. Most of the studies related to process modeling of hydrothermal gasification are performed using Aspen Plus. However, it is important to note that Open sources software such as DWSIM Chemical Process Simulator and COCO Simulator are gaining attention as process simulation tools to model the thermochemical conversion process. These simulators are non-commercial and free-of-charge as opposed to the high costs associated with the purchase and maintenance of commercial process simulator software programs. Tangsathitkulchai et al. [112] used the COCO simulator to model the slow pyrolysis of five different biomasses including palm kernel cake, coconut shell, cassava pulp residue, palm shell and longan fruit seed. Recently, Tangsriwong et al. [113] compared the performance of an open-source process simulator software DWSIM with that of Aspen Plus for simulating chemical processes. The authors concluded that DWSIM produced similar results with that of Aspen plus. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study reported on the use of DWSIM and COCO simulators for modeling the hydrothermal gasification process. In general, process modeling and CFD are wider contexts to apply thermodynamics and kinetics models, respectively. In process modeling, the overall aim is to estimate the cost of the process (reactor is often modeled with RGibbs, although it is not a requirement). In CFD modeling, the primary objective is designing the reactor, which requires consideration of a detailed fluid dynamics study. Furthermore, some kinetic studies should be incorporated into such an analysis."
7,Optimization of process parameters in hydrothermal gasification,"Optimization of process parameters involves the selection of the optimal operating parameters that can maximize the desired product’s yield and gasification efficiency during an SCW gasification process while minimizing the overall expenditure. In most cases, H2 is the desired product from the SCW gasification process. Therefore, several factors have been comprehensively studied to influence H2 yield to include reaction temperature, pressure, residence time, feed concentration (or biomass-to-water ratio), feedstock particle size together with the type and loading of catalysts [51]. To select the best combination of most or all these parameters, several statistical optimization techniques have been reported such as the univariate, factorial, Taguchi, response surface methodology and design of experiments (DOE). It is important to note that several optimization methods such as Lagrange multipliers, Newton-Raphson, Gauss-Newton and numerical methods are available. However, concerning SCW gasification, the main objective is to optimize the process efficiency and performance based on H2 yield and selectivity together with the gasification efficiency. Factorial, Taguchi, RSM and DOE are statistical optimization methods used to determine the optimum combination of process parameters that result in the maximum gas yields during the SCW gasification process. The DOE is a useful data collection and analysis tool used to evaluate the relationship between process parameters (factors) and their output (response) in a wide variety of experimental situations. The use of DOE enables the effect of several factors on the response to be studied together with their interactions. Furthermore, DOE enables a mathematical representation of the process factors after performing a minimal number of structured experiments [114]. Table 3 compares different optimization strategies applicable to hydrothermal gasification together with their merits and limitations. On the other hand, Table 4 summarizes some notable optimization studies reported during the last decade on hydrothermal gasification of biomass. In most of the RSM studies related to SCW gasification reported in the literature, there is insufficient preliminary work related to the range of independent process parameters selected. This would invariably lead to a non-optimum point situation since an unsuitable range of the independent variable is chosen. In such a case, the minimum (or maximum) value of the dependent variable without a stationary point is selected as the optimum point. Such types of studies are ordinarily not referred to as optimization studies except for reasonable explanation on the selection of the range of the independent parameters. Besides, the predicted equation should be verified with experimental data."
8,Univariate (one variable at a time) approach,"4.1 Univariate (one variable at a time) approach The univariate approach is a common and traditional method used to investigate the influence of experimental factors on gas yield during the hydrothermal gasification process. This technique involves changing the level of a single parameter and studying the effects on the response while keeping other parameters constant. Several authors have used this technique to study the effects of process parameters during hydrothermal gasification of biomass [20,31,123,124]. The most useful application of a univariate approach is found in batch hydrothermal gasification studies to investigate the influence of temperature, residence time and feed concentration on gas yields. Ding et al. [123] used the univariate method to study the influence of temperature (400–550 °C), catalysts (e.g. Ni/CeO2/Al2O3, KOH, calcined dolomite and calcined olivine) and water-to-biomass ratio during hydrothermal gasification of cellulose and pinewood. An increase in the reaction temperature and water-to-biomass ratio favored H2 yields. For the non-catalytic gasification of cellulose, a maximum H2 yield of 1.2 mmol/g was obtained at 550 °C with a water-to-biomass ratio of 7:1. On the other hand, the KOH catalyst elevated H2 yield to 2 mmol/g under similar conditions. Nanda et al. [31] applied the univariate approach to study the influence of temperature (400–600 °C), biomass-to-water ratio (1:5 and 1:10) and residence time (15–45 min) on gas yield during SCW gasification of fruit waste and agro-food residues at 23–25 MPa pressure. Their studies revealed that H2 yield is enhanced by elevated temperature, lower feed concentration and prolonged residence time. The maximum H2 yield of 2.15 mmol/g was obtained for coconut shells at an optimal temperature, residence time and biomass-to-water ratio of 600 °C, 45 min and 1:10, respectively. The univariate approach has also been used to optimize catalyst composition and examine the effects of different catalyst supports and catalyst synthesis methods in hydrothermal gasification studies. Kang et al. [124] studied the influence of different catalyst preparation methods (i.e. co-precipitation and wet impregnation) on H2 yield during the SCW gasification of lignin at 650 °C and 26 MPa with a water-to-biomass mass ratio of 5. Their results indicated the co-precipitation method to be more efficient than wet impregnation for catalysts preparation. A recent study by Okolie et al. [23] optimized H2 yield by varying the reaction temperature (300–500 °C), residence time (30–60 min), biomass particle size (0.13 mm and 0.8 mm) and biomass-to-water ratio (1:5 and 1:10) during hydrothermal gasification of soybean straw in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at a pressure range of 22–25 MPa. A maximum H2 yield of 6.6 mmol/g was obtained at a higher temperature (500 °C), intermediate residence time (45 min), lower biomass-to-water ratio (1:10) and smaller biomass particle size (0.13 mm). It should be noted that the univariate approach is flexible and easy to apply. However, it cannot be used to study the interactions between the operating parameters. The interactions could play a significant part in the process. Moreover, their effects on the response can even exceed the effects of individual process parameters."
9,Factorial method (full and fractional factorial),"4.2 Factorial method (full and fractional factorial) Compared to the univariate approach, the factorial designs can study the influence of more than one factor and levels simultaneously. Factorial designs typically include different combinations of factors and levels, which enable the screening and identification of the factors that have the highest effect on the response. Such methods are useful for preliminary studies or to perform initial optimization steps [125]. Factorial designs can be performed by using either coded factor levels or the real factor levels. The coded factor levels are mostly preferred because they provide a uniform framework to study the influence of a factor on the response in an experiment. Furthermore, the model coefficients for coded factor levels are dimensionless. Therefore, they are directly comparable. This makes it effective for the determination of the relative size of the factor effect [126]. Factorial design can be grouped into two categories, namely full factorial design and fractional factorial design [126]. The full factorial design involves the complete testing of all possible combinations of each factor level. The number of experimental runs required for a full factorial design with n-factors and p-level is denoted with p n [127]. For example, factorial design with two-levels and four factors, denoted by 24, requires a total number of sixteen experimental runs. Hendry et al. [117] applied the 23 factorial method to study the effect of temperature (750–800 °C), reaction time (4–6.5 s) and feed concentration (10–15 wt%) on the gas yields during SCW gasification of glucose in a continuous reactor. A maximum H2 yield of 59.5 wt% was obtained at 800 °C in 4 s with 10 wt% feed concentration. Owing to the large number of experimental runs required for the full factorial design, this method can be tedious and time-consuming during the hydrothermal gasification process. On the other hand, fractional factorial is preferred when many factors are involved as it minimizes the total number of experiments required. Miller et al. [128] used the 23–1 fractional design to study the effect of temperature (550 and 600 °C), feed concentration (17.5 and 25 wt%) and residence time (4 and 9 s) on product yield during SCW gasification of Spirulina algae in a continuous reactor. Four experimental runs were required for the fractional design compared to eight experiments needed for a full factorial design with similar factors and levels. Among the three factors studied, temperature and residence time had the most statistically significant effects on gasification efficiency. Lu et al. [116] also reported the use of the fractional factorial method to study the influence of four parameters on H2 yield during SCW gasification of corncob. The order in which these factors influenced the H2 yield was temperature > pressure > feedstock concentration > residence time. The fractional factorial design provides a feasible alternative when the number of experimental runs required for the full factorial is too large. Therefore, the influence of certain variables on a response can be obtained under cost-effective, time-efficient and feasible conditions. It is important to note that both full and fractional factorial designs permit free interaction with data and the opportunity to make comparisons, seek similarities, trends, differences, etc. [125]. Moreover, the full factorial designs are rotatable. Hence, it cannot accurately predict the space that is equidistance from the center. The Taguchi, central composite, Box-Behnken and Plackett-Burman designs have embedded fractional design functions [126]."
10,Taguchi method,"4.3 Taguchi method The Taguchi method is an experimental design approach used for process optimization studies and the design of high-quality systems. Such a design can minimize the total number of experiments while providing accuracy and consistency to the process. It is a factorial-based method that uses the orthogonal array (i.e. series of experiments under different situations) to assign the factors selected for an experiment (i.e. variables). Taguchi method is a relatively simple, efficient and systematic optimization technique [129]. According to the Taguchi method, the process or product optimization should be performed in a three-step approach comprising of the system, parameters and tolerance design [130]. The system design involves the use of scientific and engineering knowledge to produce a functional prototype design. It comprises the product and process design stage. On the contrary, the parameter design aims to optimize the process variables to enhance the process performance and identify the combination of process variables that can produce optimum output. Therefore, the parameter design is the most important step in achieving quality while reducing the cost in the Taguchi design. The Taguchi design recommends the use of a loss function, which is further transformed into a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for measuring the deviation between the experimental and the desired values. The S/N ratio is defined as the ratio of the mean value of quality characteristics of the response to the corresponding standard deviation. It can be used to determine the level of each factor that could optimize the response. In the analysis of the S/N ratio, three categories of performance characteristics are inherent i.e. lower-the-better, higher-the-better and nominal-the-better [129,130]. It is important to note that a statistical analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA) is usually carried out to evaluate the statistically significant variables. Therefore, a Taguchi design coupled with ANOVA analysis could help to determine the optimum conditions for a process. Only a few studies have reported the use of the Taguchi method to optimize process variables during the SCW gasification process [115,156]. Kang et al. [115] used the L18 = 21 × 33 Taguchi method to study the influence of temperature, catalysts loading, biomass type and catalyst type on H2 yield during SCW gasification of cellulose, lignin and waste biomass. The L18 design comprised of a mixture of a three-factor three-level design and one-factor two-level design with eighteen experiments. In terms of H2 yield, the authors reported the importance of each parameter in the following order: temperature > catalyst loading > catalyst type > biomass type."
11,Response surface methodology,"4.4 Response surface methodology The response surface methodology (RSM) is a very popular statistical technique used to model and optimize a process where the output (i.e. response) is sensitive to various parameters. The RSM approach helps in evaluating the influence of various parameters and their interactions on the response. It uses empirical statistical methods to model the relationship between process variables and the response. The variables that affect the process (i.e. factors) can also be called the independent variables while the response (i.e. output) is known as the dependent variable. In comparison to the univariate approach, RSM offers the following advantages. Firstly, RSM can study the interactive effects of the variables on the response. Secondly, RSM can develop a mathematical equation as a function of the variables and the response. The equation can be used to predict the response results for future observations. Moreover, RSM can save the process expenditures by minimizing the number of experiments, labor and resources involved. In the RSM methodology, the experimental data are usually fitted with a polynomial model at the second level [131]. Compared to the factorial design, the second-order polynomial is suitable for systems where the relationship between the factors and response exhibits a curvature. The RSM approach has been used for optimization studies in various fields such as energy applications [132], desulfurization [133], wastewater treatment [134] and food processing [135] to name a few. Fig. 6 shows the sequential steps that should be applied when using the RSM for optimization studies. RSM starts with the problem description and identification of important factors and responses. In some cases, when several factors (>6) are involved, a screening experiment could be performed to select the most important factors for further analysis followed by the selection of appropriate design. Finally, model evaluation and validation are carried out. Central composite design (CCD) and Box-Behnken (BBD) are the two most common RSM approaches used for optimization studies. The CCD approach is a factorial or fractional factorial design that contains a center point augmented with a group of star points or axial points [136]. These points enable the estimation of curvatures in the model. The CCD method is suitable for sequential experiment designs where experiments with many factors can follow a screening to select the most significant factors. The CCD approach has an embedded factorial design whose results can be modified to include axial and center points as shown in Fig. 7. On the contrary, the BBD approach does not include an embedded fractional or full factorial design. Instead, the design points fall at combinations of the high- and low-factor levels and their center (mid) points [136]. Compared to the CCD method, the BBD approach does not have axial points. Therefore, the BBD method is useful for performing experiments that are feasible to operate beyond the safe operating limits. In the case of CCD design, the axial points could drift outside the cube (Fig. 7), thus the design points could exceed the initial levels. The CCD design has been applied to optimize SCW gasification studies by a few researchers [118,119]. Yang et al. [118] used the CCD method to optimize the gas yield by varying the reaction temperature (300–600 °C), feed concentration (1–7 wt%) and KOH catalyst loading (0.61–2.39 mol/L) during the hydrothermal gasification of glycerol. The optimal H2 yield of 27.9 mol% was obtained at 500 °C, 7 wt% feed concentration and 2.39 mol/L KOH concentration. The authors also developed a mathematical model that is a function of H2 yield and process variables (Eq. (10)). (10) Y 1 = − 13.482037 − 0.024915 x 1 − 0.083493 x 2 − 0.619165 x 3 − 0.396968 x 1 2 + 0.005948 x 1 x 2 − 0.000077745 x 2 2 + 1.137758 x 1 x 2 + 0.003977 x 2 x 3 − 0 : 637451 x 3 2 where Yi represents the H2 yield while x1, x2 and x3 represent the factors i.e. glycerol concentration (wt%), reaction temperature (°C), and KOH concentration (mol/L), respectively. Kang et al. [124] used the CCD method to study the interactions between different process conditions and their influence on H2 yield during the SCW gasification of lignin in a batch reactor. Their results show a strong interaction between water-to-biomass ratio and higher temperatures (>525 °C) on H2 yield. On the contrary, the changes in pressure did not affect H2 yield drastically. The optimal H2 yield of 1.6 mmol/g biomass was obtained at 651 °C, 25 MPa with a water-to-biomass ratio of 3.9 in 50 min Samiee-Zafarghandi et al. [121] used the RSM approach based on BBD design to model and optimize the influence of different process variables such as temperature, residence time and feed concentration on H2 generation during SCW gasification of Chlorella microalga. The authors reported a maximum H2 yield of 21.1 mol% at 405 °C with 1.4 wt% feed concentration in 45 min. Furthermore, the BBD method was used to study the interactions between the factors and their effects on H2 yield. No interaction was observed between the reaction temperature and microalgae loading concerning the H2 yield. On the contrary, at low temperatures (i.e. subcritical conditions), the interactions between reaction time and temperature are minimized. However, the interaction became inherent in supercritical conditions (i.e. high-temperatures and high-pressures). Okolie et al. [20] reported similar results during SCW gasification of cellulose in a tubular batch reactor. The authors attributed this behavior to the formation of char and tars at low temperature and their inability to be decomposed at longer reaction times, thereby preventing further degradation of the intermediate byproducts and gas production."
12,Mixture design of experiments,"4.5 Mixture design of experiments The mixture DOE belongs to a special category of RSM in which the response (i.e. parameter) consists of mixtures containing several components. It is mainly used to optimize or design a product that involves different mixtures or formulations. The response is designed as a function of the relative proportions of different components present in the mixture. It could also depend on the number of components present in the mixture. One major merit of the mixture DOE is the ability to naturally define the experimental region of interest [137]. A considerable amount of literature has been published on the hydrothermal gasification of binary or tertiary mixtures in SCW gasification [138–141]. Reddy et al. [39] evaluated the gasification of binary mixtures containing glycerol and methanol as model waste from biodiesel refinery. Castello et al. [142] gasified mixtures of glucose and phenol in SCW to study the interactions between both feedstocks and the influence on gasification efficiency. Su et al. [143] investigated the interactions between the components of sewage sludge (i.e. alanine and phenol). Guo et al. [144] comprehensively evaluated the gasification characteristics of two- and three-component mixtures including acetic acid, phenol and NaOH catalysts in SCW gasification of acetic acid and phenol. In most of the reported studies, it is rare to find the application of a mixture design. Instead, a conventional proportion is mostly applied. In contrast, the interactions of the components are usually evaluated by using the weighted average method based on the rule of mixtures [142]. The weighted average gas yield of the mixtures is first calcula ted based on the mixing rules. Furthermore, the gas yield obtained from the SCW gasification of feed mixtures is compared with that of the weighted average. A deviation between the mixture gas yield and the weighted average indicates that there is an interaction between individual components of the mixture. The limited application of the mixture design for SCW gasification could be due to the statistical complexity involved in mixture design, data analysis (when the number of components is more than three) and graphical interpretation. Wang et al. [122] have applied the mixture design to optimize product composition during SCW gasification of mixtures. They used the mixture design to optimize SCW gasification of a three-component mixture consisting of phenol, naphthalene and acetic acid and study their interactive effect on H2 yield. Fig. 8 shows a three-component mixture of surface plots for each gaseous yield from the mixture design. The 3D mixture plots show that the interactive effect of phenol and naphthalene has a negative influence on H2 and CO2 yields. Furthermore, the negative influence on H2 is more pronounced. However, the interactive effects between the three compounds favored CH4 yields."
13,Future prospects in modeling and optimization of hydrothermal gasification,"The mechanism of SCW gasification often involves a series of complex reactions (e.g. reforming, methanation, hydrogenation, water-gas shift, Boudouard reaction, ionic product formation, free radical generation, depolymerization, hydrolysis, re-polymerization, etc.) some of which occur concurrently depending on temperature, pressure, reaction time and feedstock concentration. In the case of lignocellulosic biomass, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are hydrolyzed and reformed into acids, alcohols, furfurals, phenolics, hydroxymethylfurfural and other intermediate byproducts during hydrothermal gasification. These intermediate byproducts subsequently dissociate into permanent gases such as CO2, CO, H2, CH4 and C2–C4 gases through the ionic and free radical mechanisms. Several reactions such as water-gas shift reaction, methanation and hydrogenation reactions are involved in the formation of permanent gases depending on the operating conditions as mentioned earlier. Secondary reactions such as re-polymerization and Boudouard result in tar and char formation. This explains the complexity and correlation of the different hydrothermal and reaction pathways occurring during SCW gasification of biomass. However, thermodynamic model predictions seem to be far from experimental results for residence time less than 10 s. Therefore, the knowledge of reactions during the first seconds is of crucial importance, as their investigation could greatly enhance the reliability of the models. Specific reaction conditions and selective catalysts could accelerate particular reaction pathways, thus enhancing H2 yields. Under supercritical conditions, the unique thermophysical properties of water facilitate the dissolution of complex organic compounds, hydrocarbon and gases. These dissolved organics participate in various reactions such as reforming, dehydration, hydrolysis and polymerization to produce permanent gases based on the ionic and free radical mechanisms [51]. On the other hand, increasing the temperature leads to a free radical mechanism that promotes methanation and water-gas shift reactions. The non-dissolved organic and inorganic compounds are either retained in the liquid products and char or precipitate in the reactor leading to plugging issues [58]. Good knowledge of different modeling and optimization methods could help understand the progression of individual reaction routes and the role of catalysts in accelerating the process together with the effect of dissolved and non-dissolved organics on reaction products. The statistical DOE is an effective approach to study the effects of process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, feed concentration, residence time, biomass particle size, etc.) and their interactions on the yield and composition of the products obtained from hydrothermal gasification of waste biomass [20]. Despite the success in the application of this method, few studies are reported that use RSM in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis applied to SCW gasification. Furthermore, the mixture DOE approach can naturally define the experimental region of interest but is seldom used in hydrothermal gasification of two- or three-component mixtures. The design could also be applied for the optimization of heterogeneous catalysts recipe in terms of active metal loading and promoter/metal ratio. However, DOE requires in-depth statistical knowledge and specialized or proprietary software for data analysis and interpretation. The numerical simulation method based on the CFD approach is advantageous over other experimental methods in revealing some fundamental gasification mechanisms. More importantly, for SCW gasification involving fluidized bed reactors, the CFD models can provide detailed information such as particle distribution, residence time, temperature gradient, hydrodynamics and fluidization regime in several zones of the reactor. This could potentially provide solutions to the most prevalent reactor corrosion and plugging issues encountered during SCW gasification. However, most of the CFD studies on hydrothermal gasification reported so far have used model compounds of biomass such as glucose and glycerol as the feedstocks [93,101,145]. It is also important to study hydrodynamics and the flow behavior of actual biomass in SCW. Only a few studies have evaluated the behavior of real biomass in SCW using CFD modeling [68,146]. CFD models are usually validated with experimental data obtained from SCW gasification of biomass performed in batch or continuous reactors. Such data typically includes the carbon gasification efficiency, H2 yield and selectivity as well as total gas yields. Batch and continuous reactors have been widely used for experimental studies during hydrothermal gasification. However, batch reactors are preferred because of their simplistic design for laboratory-scale studies. On the other hand, process modeling is performed by simulating the behavior and performance of each equipment and unit operation in a processing plant. The process is mostly modeled as continuous. It should also be noted that in an industrial setting, continuous reaction systems are preferred over batch reaction systems to minimize production time, energy input, labor and operational or maintenance cost. Continuous reactors are assumed to operate with a specific downtime period annually. Moreover, continuous reactors are a preferred way to establish heat recovery, which is a crucial issue to make SCW gasification economically viable. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence, which enables a system to learn and improve with experiences and automation. Such approaches can accurately predict the outputs by building algorithms that can receive inputs and apply statistical analysis to predict the outputs [147]. Moreover, the outputs are updated automatically upon receiving new data. Machine learning algorithms such as random forest regression, gradient boosting machine, linear regression (LR), K nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine regression (SVMR) and decision tree regression (DTR) have recently received much interest in predicting the product yields from biorefining technologies [148,149]. However, to date, none of these studies has applied the above-mentioned algorithms for product prediction during the hydrothermal gasification process. Machine learning has much potential to develop prediction models for the yields of gases, liquid effluent and hydrochar during hydrothermal gasification of biomass and organic wastes. Artificial neural networks are widely being applied in various disciplines such as biomedicine, pharmacy, computer science, agriculture, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, biotechnology, and recently in chemical and biological engineering. Compared to other modeling and optimization techniques, ANNs presents non-linearity in a superior manner. Furthermore, it does not involve any mathematical description of the phenomena to be modeled and their adaptability and learning are designed in such a way to permit the system to update itself [150]. ANN constructs a model of an existing system or phenomena, learns from the input results or data and trains the network to produce a target with the least error. ANN has been used to model thermochemical conversion processes such as pyrolysis [150] and thermochemical gasification [151–153]. Despite the literature available on ANN modeling of biomass gasification and pyrolysis, no study has been reported on its application to hydrothermal gasification. Most machine learning algorithms require a huge amount of experimental data before the model can accurately predict the output. This could be challenging and very expensive because the hydrothermal gasification reactor is operated at high-temperature and high-pressures. Furthermore, researchers with limited programming experience could find the application of machine learning quite challenging. Nevertheless, the studies relating to the optimization and modeling of hydrothermal gasification could be invaluable for process commercialization, scale-up, addressing the technical challenges, reducing the process expenditure and opening new frontiers for future research."
14,Conclusions,"The elevating prices of conventional fossil fuels and the environmental pollution associated with their consumption have stimulated interest in alternative energy resources. Hydrothermal gasification is an eco-friendly process used to disintegrate carbonaceous materials under hot and pressurized aqueous conditions for producing H2-rich syngas, hydrochar and liquid product. The process takes advantage of the ubiquitous properties of SCW such as fast reaction rate, efficient dissolution of organic materials as well as fast mass and heat transfer to convert waste biomass into H2. Detailed information about the kinetics of hydrothermal gasification coupled with the complex chemical and physical processes taking place remains unclear. Thorough knowledge of this underlying information is necessary for process optimization, efficient reactor design and subsequent scaling up, techno-economic analysis, heat recovery, thermal efficiency optimization and reducing the overall process expenditures. The optimization and modeling of hydrothermal gasification are essential to effectively understand the underlying events and phenomena occurring during the thermochemical decomposition of organic substances in subcritical and supercritical water. However, the technical challenges and high processing cost of SCW gasification necessitates its integration with other supplementary biorefinery processes. The studies on process modeling of SCW gasification to evaluate its techno-economic aspects are limited in the literature."
