0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of alcohols is an important organic synthesis reaction in industry, because the products can be directly used as a chemical product, or as a raw material for the downstream chemical industry to synthesize fine chemicals [1–3]. Taking the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol as an example, its products benzaldehyde are important chemicals which are widely used in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries [3,4]. Traditional processes applied for benzaldehyde production mainly include benzyl chloride hydrolysis and toluene chlorination, which produce products containing chlorides, seriously restricting its application. By contrast, the partial oxidation of benzyl alcohol is a green process, which produces benzaldehyde with high purity, suitable for food and pharmaceutical applications. The commonly investigated catalysts for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol are supported noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) catalysts [5–7]. So far, many reported experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the catalytic performance of bimetallic Au-Pd NPs is superior to that of monometallic Pd or Au NPs [8–11], because of the synergistic effect in bimetallic Au-Pd catalysts [12–14]. For instance, a high activity in benzyl alcohol oxidation was obtained on Au-Pd bimetallic catalysts [6,14], however the deep oxidation of the target products to low-cost or even unwanted by-products is usually observed, which reduces the economic benefits of the reaction, and also renders the subsequent product separation cumbersome. In our previous work, Au-Pd bimetallic NPs supported on mesoporous silica support were applied for the benzyl alcohol oxidation, and a high benzyl alcohol conversion (>90%) was obtained but with a low benzaldehyde selectivity (ca. 60%) [6]. Similar results were also observed by Hutchings et al [15]. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop a catalyst with both high activity and high benzaldehyde selectivity. Han and co-workers reported that the introduction of Lewis acids (metal chlorides) significantly promoted the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone on a commercial palladium catalyst. It was found that Lewis acid coordination rendered the benzene ring of phenol more active, and the acid-base interaction between the Lewis acid and the Lewis basic CO group in cyclohexanone inhibits the further hydrogenation reaction, leading to a high cyclohexanone selectivity (>99.9%) [16]. However, metal chlorides lead to serious corrosion during the reaction, which limit its industrial application. At the same time, Fang and coworkers [17] found that the acid–base properties of the support play critical roles in the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol, and the benzaldehyde selectivity was strongly affected by the acid-base properties of the support. These results indicate that to design a catalyst support with suitable surface acidity, especially with rich Lewis acid sites, may prevent the benzaldehyde from over oxidation via the interaction between Lewis acid and CO group in benzaldehyde, consequently improving the benzaldehyde selectivity. As is well-known, because of its low cost, high physicochemical stability, and superior pore structure, Al2O3 has been commercially applied as catalyst or catalyst support for many industrial processes [18–21]. It has been long recognized that Al2O3 possesses sole surface Lewis acid sites [22,23], therefore representing a potential catalyst support for benzyl alcohol oxidation to achieve a high benzaldehyde selectivity. In addition, the surface Lewis acidity can be enhanced by doping some promoters. Lavalley et al reported that the concentration of surface Lewis acid sites increased with the increase of ZrO2 content in ZrO2-Al2O3 mixed oxides [24]. In another report, a ZrO2 promoted Cu/ZrO2/SiO2 catalyst was developed by Lam et al [25] for CO2 hydrogenation reaction, and the introduction of Zr(IV) into SiO2 resulted in the formation of Lewis acid sites, which were found to be responsible for the high activity and high CH3OH selectivity of catalyst. Thus, it can be reasonably envisaged that ZrO2 could work as an appropriate promoter to enhance the benzaldehyde selectivity in benzyl alcohol oxidation [26–28]. Based on the above considerations, in this work, we prepared Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 catalysts by a stepwise impregnation method using γ-Al2O3 as a support and ZrO2 as a promoter. The promoting effects of ZrO2 on the surface properties of catalysts were studied. And the role of the ZrO2 in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was explored."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Commercial pseudo-boehmite was purchased from Aladdin Co., Ltd. HAuCl4·xH2O, PdCl2, ZrOCl2·8H2O, benzyl alcohol (99.99%), benzaldehyde (99.99%), benzoic acid (99.99%) and absolute ethanol (99.98%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical. All chemicals were used as received without further purification."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts γ-Al2O3 support was obtained by calcining commercialized pseudo-boehmite at 500 °C for 3 h. ZrO2 modified Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by a stepwise impregnation method. In a typical synthesis procedure, 1 g of γ-Al2O3 was dispersed in a certain amount of ZrOCl2 solution, and stirred to form a viscous slurry. The obtained slurry was dried at 100 °C for 12 h, and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain ZrO2 promoted γ-Al2O3 support xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 (where x is the weight percentage of ZrO2 introduced). After that, 3 mL of PdCl2 solution was added dropwise into 1 g of x ZrO2-γ-Al2O3, stirred for 12 h, and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. Then, 2 mL of HAuCl4 solution was added to the dried solid sample. After stirring and drying for 12 h, the obtained sample was reduced at 400 °C for 2 h under a hydrogen atmosphere to obtain catalyst Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3. The Au and Pd loadings were keep consistent as a weight percentage of 0.2% and 0.5% respectively, and x is varied as a weight percentage of 0%, 5%, 10% and 15%, respectively. For comparison purpose, Au-Pd/SiO2 catalyst was prepared following the same procedure of catalyst Au-Pd/Al2O3 with mesoporous silica made in our lab as support."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystalline structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using an X’Pert PRO MPD instrument with a Cu Ka radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 35 kV and 40 mA. N2 adsorption/desorption was carried out at –196 °C using an automatic volumetric sorption analyzer (Micromeritics, TriStar 3000) after degassing at 300 °C for 4 h under vacuum. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-high angle annular dark field (HAADF) images and X-ray energy dispersive spectra (XEDS) were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV to analyze the element distribution of bimetallic NPs. The solid ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra analysis was performed on a UV–vis-NIR scanning spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3101 PC) by using BaSO4 as an internal reference. The metal loading in the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a VISTA-MPX Varian system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded on an AXIS HIS 165 spectrometers (Kratos Analytical) with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source. C 1s electron binding energy corresponding to graphitic carbon at 284.5 eV was applied as a calibration binding energy reference. Pyridine adsorbed Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was carried out on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer, equipped with a MCT liquid nitrogen cooled detector and a KBr beam splitter. FT-IR analysis of benzaldehyde adsorbed samples was carried out on a Bruker Vertex 70 V spectrometer after benzaldehyde adsorption overnight at room temperature and vacuum dried at 170 °C for 12 h. And the spectrum of free benzaldehyde was measured as a reference. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy using CO probe molecule on fresh catalysts was conducted in a high temperature diffuse reflectance cell (PIKE). The spectra were recorded on a BRUKER VERTEX70V FT-IR spectrometer at room temperature with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The samples were first pretreated in H2 at 300 °C for 1 h with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1, cooled down to 30 °C and purged with He for 30 min. Then 5% CO/He gas with the flow rate of 50 mL/min was introduced into the cell until the CO adsorption was saturated· NH3-TPD analysis was carried out on Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. Before analysis, the sample was pretreated in He at 500 °C for 1 h with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1, cooled down to 70 °C and purged with 10%NH3/He for 1 h. Then the system was heated to 700 °C with a He flow rate of 30 mL/min. H2-TPR was also performed on the same instrument. 0.1 g of the catalyst was heated to 300 °C in He with a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min, and then cooled to 20 °C. The TPR profile of the catalyst was obtained by heating the sample from 30 to 900 °C in a flow of 10% H2/N2 (50 mL/min)."
5,Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"2.4 Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol The catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts for benzyl alcohol oxidation was carried out in a 100 mL autoclave with a polytetrafluoroethylene liner (Model: SLM100, Beijing Easychem Science and Technology Development Company, China). In a typical process, 10.8 g of benzyl alcohol and 50 mg of catalyst were added into the micro-reactor, and purged with O2 for 3 times. After purging, the O2 pressure was maintained at 0.2 MPa and the reactor was heated to 110 °C. The reaction was carried out at 110 °C for 2 h under an O2 pressure of 0.8 MPa. After reaction, the mixture was filtrated and the liquid products were analyzed on a gas chromatogram (Agilent 6870) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using a DB-1 column (30 × 0.32 × 0.25). The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated based on moles of benzyl alcohol converted per mole of surface Pd atoms per hour. The regeneration and recycle of catalysts were carried out as follows. After 2 h of reaction, the catalyst was retrieved from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with ethanol for 3 times, followed by drying at 80 °C for 8 h. Finally, the dried catalyst was reduced under H2 atmosphere at 400 °C for 2 h and then subjected to the next cycle. Due to the loss of catalysts, the amount of benzyl alcohol fed for the following cycles was reduced accordingly."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns of catalysts Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 1 A and the detailed lattice parameters are summarized in Table 1 . As shown in Fig. 1A, three diffraction peaks at 37.6°(3 1 1), 45.8°(4 0 0), and 66.8°(4 4 0) corresponding to γ-Al2O3 phase (JCPDS card no.: 29-0063) were observed on all catalysts, indicating the formation of γ-Al2O3 [29–31] after calcination of pseudo-boehmite. With the increase of zirconium content, the peak of γ-Al2O3 becomes broadened and the peak intensity decreased, which indicates the presence of interaction between Al and ZrO2 and a part of Al atoms probably interacted with Zr to form Al-O-Zr bonds [32]. No obvious diffraction peak of ZrO2 was detected on Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 catalysts, indicating the high dispersion of zirconia [33]. The characteristic peaks of cubic Au at 38.25°(1 1 1), 44.46°(2 0 0), and 64.69°(2 2 0) (JCPDS card no.: 65-8601) were detected on catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 [34], however, these three peaks gradually disappeared with the increase of ZrO2 content, indicating that the introduction of ZrO2 enhanced the noble metal dispersion on the γ-Al2O3 support or led to the formation of Au-Pd alloy NPs. According to the Bragg equation [35], the inter-planar spacings of the cubic Au(1 1 1) were calculated to be 0.2351 and 0.2359 nm on catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3, respectively, indicating a distortion of the Au lattice after introducing ZrO2. And from Table 1, the lattice parameter variation of γ-Al2O3 confirmed the presence of strong interaction between ZrO2 and γ-Al2O3. Furthermore, no obvious diffraction peaks of Pd (2θ = 40.0, 46.6, and 68.1°) were observed from the XRD analysis, indicating the high dispersion of Pd or formation of Au-Pd alloy NPs, which needs to be further verified. The solid UV–vis spectra of catalysts are shown in Fig. 1B. The absorption peak at 522 nm due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au0 nanoparticles was observed on pure Au NP catalyst. After introducing Pd, this SPR peak became broadened on catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3, indicating Au was mainly present as Au-Pd alloy NPs on catalysts Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3. Moreover, this Au0 SPR peak disappeared with further increasing ZrO2 content on catalysts Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/15%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3. This is consistent with the XRD results that introducing ZrO2 into the Au-Pd catalyst promoted the dispersion of Au/Pd and formation of Au-Pd alloy NPs. And the formation of Au-Pd alloy NPs was commonly considered as the origin of synergistic effect for benzyl alcohol oxidation. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of catalysts Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 1C and D, and the detailed structural properties are summarized in Table 1. All catalysts exhibit a type IV isotherm (classification by the IUPAC), which is characteristic of mesoporous materials [36], and the hysteresis loop in the adsorption–desorption isotherm is of H-2 type (as shown in Fig. 1C) with closure points at high relative pressures (above P/P0 = 0.9), indicating the large pore sizes and presence of ink-bottle-shaped pores [37,38]. As shown in Table 1, the surface area, pore volume and pore size of the catalysts slightly decreases with the increase of ZrO2 up to 10%, and further increasing the ZrO2 content (up to 15%) led to a significant decrease in the specific surface area and pore volume, suggesting that a large amount of ZrO2 may block the mesopores. The pore size distribution curves of catalysts are shown in Fig. 1D, and a similar pore size distribution was observed with a pore diameter in the range of 3–7 nm, while the pore volume and average pore size decreased with the increase of ZrO2 content, suggesting the good dispersion of ZrO2 on the pore surface of γ-Al2O3 support and partial shrinkage of the pore size. And an excessive amount of ZrO2 may lead to the deterioration of pore structure, which is detrimental to the diffusion of reactants and products during the reaction. Thus, the optimized ZrO2 content should be less than 10%. The element distribution in the particles has a significant effect on the catalytic performance, which can be revealed by STEM technique [39,40]. Representative STEM-HAADF images of catalysts (with inserted energy dispersive line scanning of Pt-L and Au-L X-rays through NPs), corresponding color-coded EDS spectra and particle size distribution histograms of catalysts Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 2 . As can be seen from Fig. 2A, the EDS mapping indicates that both Au (yellow) and Pd (green) elements are evenly distributed on catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 and the line scanning results (Fig. 2A inset) reveal that the distribution of Pd elements is in consistence with the distribution of Au except for the presence of several Au NPs, which is in good accordance with XRD and solid UV–vis data. After introducing ZrO2 on catalyst Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3, both the EDS mapping and line scanning results show a good dispersion of Zr, Au and Pd elements. Furthermore, from the STEM images and the particle size distribution histograms, it is clearly observed that the dispersion of Au-Pd bimetallic NPs on catalyst Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 is higher than that on catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3, and a smaller average particle size (4.3 ± 0.5 nm) is obtained on catalyst Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 than that on catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 (7.0 ± 0.5 nm). Thus, introducing ZrO2 enhanced the dispersion of Au and Pd elements on γ-Al2O3 support, possibly due to the interaction between Au-Pd NPs and ZrO2 promoter [41]. The interaction between Au-Pd NPs and ZrO2 promoter was explored by XPS analysis, which was applied to analyze the surface chemical properties of promoted and unpromoted Au-Pd catalysts. As shown in Fig. S2, no obvious change of the Al 2p binding energy is observed on ZrO2 promoted and unpromoted Au-Pd catalyst, indicating no obvious electron transfer between γ-Al2O3 and ZrO2 promoter. Two peaks with binding energies (BE) of ca. 83.6 eV (Au 4f7/2) and ca. 87.4 eV (Au 4f5/2) are observed on catalysts Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/15%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 [40,42]. No obvious BE change of Au 4f is observed after introducing ZrO2, revealing the interaction between ZrO2 and Au is negligible. Due to the overlap of Pd 3d with Zr 3p BE peaks and the low intensity of Pd 3d peaks, it is more convincing to analyze the variation of Zr 3p BE. Comparing with 10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 support, a positive shift of Zr 3p BE was observed on catalyst Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3, that is, the Zr 3p BE shifted from 332.7 eV on sample 10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 to 332.8–330.0 eV on catalysts Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3. These results indicated the presence of electron transfer from Zr to other components, and both Al and Au XPS spectra revealed no electron gaining after introducing ZrO2 promoter. Therefore, the electrons are most likely transferred to Pd species resulting in the reduction of Pd2+ to active Pd0 species [34,43]. It was reported that the acid–base properties of the support play key roles in the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol [17], and the benzaldehyde selectivity was closely related to the surface acidity/basicity of the support. Therefore, the surface acidity/basicity of the catalysts was characterized by pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy [44,45]. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the peaks centered at 1446 and 1614 cm−1, corresponding to the vibrational mode of pyridine binding to coordination unsaturated Al3+ sites, are assigned to Lewis acid sites [46,47], while no obvious Brönsted acid sites supposed to be observed at 1540 cm−1 were detected on these catalysts. The concentrations of acid sites are characterized by NH3-TPD and the results are presented in Fig. 3B, the detailed contents of acid sites with different strengths are summarized in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2, the introduction of small amount of ZrO2 increased the concentration of strong acid sites. The total acid sites increase first and then decrease with the increase of ZrO2 content (as shown in Table 2). When small amount of ZrO2 (such as 5%) was introduced, the interfacial interaction between ZrO2 and Al2O3 was enhanced, resulting in an imbalance of charge distribution in Al–O-Zr bonds and leading to the formation of acid sites [48]. However, the amount of detected acid sites decreases with the further increase of ZrO2 content to 15%, which is attributed to the blocking of the pores and the acid sites in the internal surface were blocked, certified by N2 adsorption/desorption results. No acidity was detected on reference catalyst Au-Pd/SiO2. DRIFT spectra of CO adsorbed on catalysts Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3, Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 3C. The peaks located at 2178 and 2116 cm -1 observed on all samples were attributed to the vibration of gaseous CO [49]. The characteristic band in the region 2000–2100 cm−1 is usually assigned to the linearly adsorbed CO [50]. The band at 2094 cm−1 observed on catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 represents the CO linearly bonded (Pd–CO) to Pd atoms of low coordination [51], which was absent on ZrO2 promoted catalysts. But one broad peak at 2028 cm−1 was observed on catalysts Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3, the intensity of which was enhanced with the increase of ZrO2 introduced. This peak was usually assigned to the CO adsorbed on isolated (atop) Pd atoms which was encapsulated by other components as a shell [52,53]. The bands in the range of 1750–2000 cm−1 was observed in catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3, which were assigned to bridged and multi-bonded CO on contiguous Pd atoms [51]. These bands were undetectable on catalysts Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3. These results indicate that the Pd ensembles were isolated or partially encapsulated by ZrO2, creating more Au-Pd-ZrO2 interfaces, which were generally considered as active sites for O2 activation during partial oxidation [54,55]. It should be noted that a new band fitting to the vibration of formed bidentate carbonate was observed at 1653 cm−1 on ZrO2 promoted catalysts [56], which was strengthened with the increase of ZrO2. Furthermore, the CO2 vibration peaks (2359 and 2341 cm−1) [49] were detected on catalyst Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3, revealing that the CO was easily oxidized to CO2 on this catalyst at room temperature (25 °C) under CO atmosphere. These results indicate that the presence of ZrO2 enhanced the oxygen transfer which may benefit for the partial oxidation of benzyl alcohol over Au-Pd NPs catalyst. Wang et al reported that introducing ZrO2 to Ni@SiO2 leads to high catalytic activity and less carbon deposition for partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas, which was due to the higher reducibility and oxygen storage/release capacity of catalyst Ni/ZrO2@SiO2 [57]. Chen and co-workers applied Coulometric titration to explore the redox properties of ZrO2 promoted Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The results indicated that much more oxygen can be removed from ZrO2 promoted catalyst than from Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. It was also reported that only the oxide at the Pd-ZrO2 interface can be reduced and the presence of ZrO2 promoted the PdO-Pd reduction at lower temperature [58]. Similar result was obtained in this work. Therefore, the presence of ZrO2 leads to a high catalytic activity, which is probably due to the enhanced oxygen transfer ability of the Pd-ZrO2 interface. H2-TPR profiles of the obtained catalysts Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 are displayed in Fig. 3D. As for catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3, the peaks at the temperature of 400–600 °C was commonly attributed to the reduction of PdO species embedded in the Al2O3 support or palladium oxychloride compound (PdOxCly) strongly interacted with the support [59,60]. In contrast, a negative reduction peak at the temperature of 64 °C was observed on catalysts Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 which could be attributed to the decomposition of β-PdHx [56,61]. Since PdO species can be easily reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere to metallic Pd, which further interacts with hydrogen to form β-PdHx species [54,56]. The presence of this peak indicated that PdO species on ZrO2 promoted catalysts can be easily reduced to active Pd0 species. The absence of reduction peaks at the temperature of 400 °C-600 °C verified this conclusion, indicating there is no strong interaction between PdO and Al2O3 support after introducing ZrO2 promoter. The reduction peak at 600–700 °C on catalysts Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/10%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 corresponds to the surface and bulk reduction of ZrO2 [8]. Combined with CO-DRIFT results, it was clear that the introduction of ZrO2 partially covered or encapsulated the Au-Pd alloy NPs and weakened the interaction between Au-Pd NPs and γ-Al2O3 support. In summary, introduction of certain amount of ZrO2 (5%) promoted the dispersion and alloying of Au-Pd NPs on γ-Al2O3, justified by XRD, UV–vis and STEM-HAADF data. ZrO2 also acts as promoter to weaken the interaction between Au-Pd and γ-Al2O3, but enhanced the interaction between Au-Pd and ZrO2, which created more active Au-Pd-ZrO2 interfaces for O2 activation, certified by CO-DRIFT and H2-TPR results. Only Lewis acid sites were detected on catalysts Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 and the surface acidity increased with a small amount of ZrO2 (5%) introduced, however, the amount of detected Lewis acid sites decreases with the further increase of ZrO2 content to 10%, which is attributed to the blocking of the acid sites in the internal surface, certified by NH3-TPD and N2 adsorption/desorption results."
8,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The catalysts Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3(x = 0, 5%, 10%, 15%) were evaluated in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with molecular oxygen. The catalytic activity and benzaldehyde selectivity on different catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 , while the detailed benzyl alcohol conversion and products selectivity are summarized in Table 3 . For comparison purpose, the benzyl alcohol partial oxidation was also carried on γ-Al2O3 and 5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 supports and catalysts Au/γ-Al2O3, Pd/γ-Al2O3, Au/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 and Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 and the detailed catalytic performance are listed in Table S1. On catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3, a benzyl alcohol conversion of 76.9% was achieved with a benzaldehyde selectivity of 82.0%. The benzaldehyde selectivity is much higher than that on mesoporous silica supported Au-Pd catalyst (ca. 60%) [62]. With the introduction of ZrO2, a volcano trend of catalytic activity and benzaldehyde selectivity was achieved, and the highest catalytic activity (TOF = 16,700 h−1) was obtained on catalyst Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 (shown in Fig. 4) with the highest benzyl alcohol conversion (86.0%) and highest benzaldehyde selectivity (85.2%). With the further increase of ZrO2 content, both the catalytic activity and benzaldehyde selectivity decreased. These results indicate that a small amount of ZrO2 introduced enhanced the catalytic activity and simultaneously improved the benzaldehyde selectivity, however, further increasing ZrO2 led to a low catalytic activity and benzaldehyde selectivity. Notably, an approximately linear relationship between benzaldehyde selectivity and the amount of surface Lewis acid sites was observed on ZrO2 promoted catalysts (as shown in Fig. 4B), indicating that the presence of Lewis acid sites inhibits the occurrence of over-oxidation reactions. The relative low benzaldehyde selectivity on catalysts Au-Pd/SiO2, Au-Pd/MCF-H2 [6] and 1 wt%(0.5Au-0.5Pd)/C [63] shown in Table 3 further confirmed the improvement of benzaldehyde selectivity on catalysts Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 with Lewis acid sites. For example, a high benzyl alcohol conversion (85.0%) was achieved on catalyst Au-Pd/SiO2 under identical reaction conditions, but a rather low benzaldehyde selectivity (65.6%) was observed, which was due to the lacking of surface Lewis acidity (Table 2) of amorphous SiO2 under normal conditions [64]. Combining with the characterization results, the enhanced catalytic activity on ZrO2 promoted catalysts Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 (TOF = 16,700 h−1) can be partially attributed to the fact that the presence of small amount of ZrO2 improved the dispersion of metals on the support. Moreover, the introduction of ZrO2 created more Au-Pd-ZrO2 interfaces for O2 activation and transfer, resulting in a high catalytic activity. A close relationship between benzaldehyde selectivity and surface acidity was observed. A relatively high benzaldehyde selectivity (82.0%) was obtained on γ-Al2O3 supported catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 with a relatively high surface acid concentration (0.95 mmol/g). Introducing 5% of ZrO2 created more surface acid sites on catalyst Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 (1.01 mmol/g) through the interfacial interaction between ZrO2 and Al2O3, which exhibited the highest benzaldehyde selectivity (85.2%), implying that the presence of Lewis acid sites inhibited the occurrence of over-oxidation reactions. Meanwhile, the relatively low benzaldehyde selectivity (75.6%) on catalyst Au-Pd/15%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 is also in good accordance with the relatively low concentration (0.78 mol/g) of detected surface Lewis acid sites. The low surface Lewis acid sites on catalyst Au-Pd/15%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 was attributed to the blockage of pore structure with large amount of ZrO2 introduced. The blockage of porous structure of the catalyst impedes the adsorption of reactants on the active sites, restricted the diffusion of products and also reduced the acid-base interaction between the Lewis acid sites and benzaldehyde, resulting in a low catalytic activity and a low benzaldehyde selectivity. In order to clarify the role of Lewis acid sites in inhibiting the over-oxidation reactions, the interaction between the catalysts and benzaldehyde was studied by FTIR analysis of benzaldehyde adsorption. Fig. 4C and D shows the FTIR spectra of benzaldehyde adsorbed catalysts after vacuum degassing at 170 °C for 12 h. The chemically adsorbed benzaldehyde on catalysts Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 was detected with the characteristic vibration peaks of benzene ring and aldehyde group (Fig. 4C). Fig. S3 shows the FTIR spectra of free benzaldehyde and benzaldehyde adsorbed on catalyst Au-Pd/SiO2 with no surface Lewis acidity. A band at 1708 cm−1 was observed on catalyst Au-Pd/SiO2 which is consistent with the typical CO stretching vibration band of free benzaldehyde (1701 cm−1), indicating no interaction between benzaldehyde and catalyst Au-Pd/SiO2. Comparing with free benzaldehyde and benzaldehyde adsorbed on catalyst Au-Pd/SiO2 in the amplified spectra (Fig. 4D), the typical band of CO stretching vibration at ~1700 cm−1 shifts to 1607 cm−1 of benzaldehyde adsorbed on catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 with Lewis acid sites, which was due to the acid-base interaction between CO group in benzaldehyde and Lewis acid sites [16]. This CO stretching vibration band was observed at 1605 cm−1 on catalyst Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3, confirming the presence of interaction between benzaldehyde and Lewis acid sites on ZrO2 promoted catalyst. A liner relationship between benzaldehyde selectivity and the amount of surface Lewis acid sites shown in Fig. 4B confirmed the protection of benzaldehyde from over-oxidation by Lewis acid sites. Based on above results, the promoting effect of ZrO2 to Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 was illustrated in Scheme 1 . ZrO2 acts as a promoter to enhance the noble metal dispersion and create more active Au-Pd-ZrO2 interfaces for O2 activation. On the other hand, the interfacial interaction between ZrO2 and γ-Al2O3 leads to formation of more surface Lewis acid sites for benzaldehyde protection, thus resulting in high catalytic activity and high benzaldehyde selectivity. The recyclability of catalysts Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 and Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 was evaluated in six consecutive reactions with repeated use of catalyst after regeneration (Fig. 5 ). As is shown in Fig. 5A, an obvious decrease of catalytic activity was observed for catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 after the 2nd run and the benzyl alcohol conversion decreased to ～50% after 6th run. In Fig. 5B, the STEM-HADDF image of catalyst Au-Pd/γ-Al2O3 indicated the partial aggregation of noble metal NPs after 6 cycles of reaction. However, no obvious activity loss was found on catalyst Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 5C) and nearly no aggregation of noble metal NPs was detected (Fig. 5D), indicating a very good stability of ZrO2 promoted catalysts. Correlating with the characterization results, the good recyclability after introducing ZrO2 could be explained by the strong interaction between Au-Pd alloy NPs and ZrO2 and/or partially encapsulated Au-Pd NPs by ZrO2 (justified by CO-DRIFT), which inhibits the sintering of noble metal NPs during reaction and maintains the high catalytic activity. The consistent benzaldehyde selectivity in six consecutive cycles revealed the high stability of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst during the reaction."
9,Conclusions,"Lewis acids in the liquid phase have been previously reported to have an acid-base interaction with CO group in ketones, which inhibited the further transformation of ketones into side-products. Inspired by this observation, in this work, we designed Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 catalysts with ZrO2 as a promoter. The introduction of certain amount of ZrO2 (5%) produced more surface Lewis acid sites on Au-Pd/xZrO2-γ-Al2O3 catalyst. And a linear trend between benzaldehyde selectivity and the amount of surface Lewis acid was observed on ZrO2 promoted catalysts, indicating that the acid-base interaction between the Lewis acid sites and benzaldehyde inhibited the occurrence of over-oxidation reactions, leading to a high benzaldehyde selectivity. Detailed physicochemical characterization results also reveal that ZrO2 acts as both structural and electronic promoter, which created more active Au-Pd-ZrO2 interfaces for O2 activation and transfer during benzyl alcohol partial oxidation. The optimized ratio of ZrO2 was determined to be about 5%, and introducing excessive amount of ZrO2 led to the wrapping of active sites and blockage of γ-Al2O3 pores. As a result, the highest catalytic activity (TOF = 16,700 h−1) and highest benzaldehyde selectivity (85.2%) were obtained on catalyst Au-Pd/5%ZrO2-γ-Al2O3. Considering that the design of catalysts with high selectivity towards desired products is always the research focus in partial oxidation processes, the strategy of protecting desired products in this work may shed light on the rational design of catalysts for general partial oxidation reactions."
