0,Introduction,"The catalytic transformation of chemical feedstocks derived from coal, petroleum, natural gas and biomass to useful chemicals tends to involve CH bond and CO band activations in molecules [1–5]. Selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is viewed as an important chemical production process, because aldehyde can be used as chemical intermediates for producing various chemicals including medicine, dyestuff, spices [6], et al. Recently, noble-metal-based catalysts showed excellent catalytic activity in selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, while the high cost of noble-metal catalysts poses a major hurdle in large-scale applications [7–9]. Therefore, seeking and designing effective non-noble metal catalysts that present good catalytic performance as those of noble-metal catalysts has always been an arduous challenge in the catalytic science, although the non-noble metal catalysts still suffer from relatively low activity. In recent years, nitrogen-doped carbon supported transition metal catalytic materials (M-N-C, M is typical of Fe, Co and Ni) were developed and applied for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [10], oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [11,12] and CO2 electroreduction reaction [13,14], as well as alcohol oxidation [15], exhibiting excellent catalytic activity. Consensus seems to have been reached that N-doped carbon matrix contributed to the enhancement of catalytic activity of supported transition metal catalysts (M-N-C). For instance, Wang et al. prepared Fe-N-C catalyst for effective ORR and further verified that the formed Fe-Nx species constituted the active sites [16]. Furthermore, N-containing carbon encapsulated Co (Co@NC) with a core-shell structure presented excellent catalytic performance, in which the electron transfer from N-containing carbon shell to Co nanoparticles (NPs) was promoted so as to enhance the ORR catalytic activity [17,18]. In addition to the widespread applications in electronic chemistry community, the M-N-C catalysts were also extended to chemosynthesis typical of catalytic hydrogenation and catalytic oxidation [19–21]. The M-N-C catalysts exhibited not only outstanding catalytic activity but also catalytic stability. The good results obtained were mainly originated from the special existing state of metal active sites of M-N-C. The M-N-C catalysts were commonly prepared via high-temperature pyrolysis method, during which metals were strongly anchored on N-doped carbon matrix by means of the strong interaction with N dopants. Specially, using this method, atomically dispersed metals anchored on N-doped carbon matrix with organic ligands as nitrogen source were also successfully fabricated. The obtained atomically dispersed metals were adequately coordinated with N atoms next to carbon atoms, forming catalytically active species M-Nx. Atomically dispersed Fe and Co have been proved to be potential catalysts for C–H activation and electronic chemistry [22–24]. With a low loading amount, the atomically dispersed transition-metal-catalysts could achieve high catalytic activity, and even comparable to those of precious metal catalysts. The reason for the excellent performance of single-atom M-N-C catalysts were attributed to the high dispersion and the special electronic structure of metal active sites. Single-atom metal, which is different from metal NPs and nanoclusters whose crystal plane and particle size usually play key roles in yielding high catalytic activity, are tightly anchored by N-containing ligands, ultimately shaping M-Nx active centers. For the promoted effect of N dopant, a detailed elaboration has been made well by constructing a Mott-Schottky-type catalyst (Co@NC) for alcohol oxidation to ester as reported by Li et al. [25,26]. The activation of N-doped carbon support to active metal was similar to that of a ligand functioning on metal in homogenous catalysis, by which electron density of active metal could be regulated by N-modified carbon support. Cao et al. utilized various characterization means together with density functional theory to unveil the high-ORR activity origin of single-atom Fe catalyst. The formed nitrogen-coordinated Fe species incorporated an Fe atom and eight C atoms linked to N, all of which served as active sites to lead to the increase of catalytic activity [27,28]. However, the preparation of single-atom catalysts commonly uses organic ligands as nitrogen source and atom dispersed protective agent. The organic ligands directly guide the formation of single-atom catalysts and even strikingly affect the catalytic activity [29,30]. In this work, we fabricated the single-atom Fe catalysts anchored on nitrogen-containing graphitic carbons (defined as SA-Fe/N-C), for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to aldehyde. The purpose of such a designing is based on the relative low catalytic efficiency of benzyl alcohol oxidation over some conventional supported metal catalysts. Taking into account that chemical production should meet the feature of economic rationality and environmental harmlessness, highly active catalysts with low cost are primarily designed and prepared for environmentally friendly production process. The SA-Fe/N-C catalyst was prepared by high-temperature pyrolysis of catalyst precursor consisting of low-cost organic ligand-coordinated Fe salt and graphite-phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The use of g-C3N4 was to provide a template as well as to act as nitrogen source [31,32], by which N-doped graphene flake-like single-atom SA-Fe/N-C catalyst with adjustable nitrogen contents could be facilely constructed. As shown in Scheme 1, Fe active sites were atomically dispersed throughout the whole N-doped carbon matrix in a coordination with N atoms by forming FeN4 active species, resulting in the reduced electron density of metallic Fe. Furthermore, by changing the ratio of g-C3N4 in SA-Fe/N-C preparation, the doping amount of N could be regulated effectively, to control the electron transfer of metallic Fe and thus the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The electronic structure investigated by various characterization methods including sub-ångström-resolution HAADF-STEM, XANES spectra, EXAFS spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS), provides a well-founded clue to reveal the structure-property correlation for the excellent catalytic activity."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Synthesis of g-C3N4 . g-C3N4 was synthesized by direct calcination of melamine. Typically, a certain amount of melamine was placed in an alumina crucible and then was heated to 520 °C for 3 h with a ramping rate 3 °C/min in air. The yellow powders obtained were used for catalyst preparation. Synthesis of SA-Fe/Nx -C. Single-atom iron catalysts were prepared by high-temperature pyrolysis of ligand-coordinated metal complexes and nitrogen-containing templates. In a typical procedure, acetate iron (86.9 mg, 0.5 mmol) and 110-phenanthroline (270.3 mg, 1.5 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL ethanol with magnetic stirring for 1 h at room temperature. Then, g-C3N4 (1.5 g, 3 g, 4.5 g) was added to the as-prepared mixed solution under a rigorous stirring for additional 12 h, after which ethanol was slowly evaporated in vacuum. The solid mixture was dried at 100 °C overnight and then was pyrolyzed at various temperatures (600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C) in argon with a heating rate of 3 °C/min for 2 h. The resulting black powders were labelled as SA-Fe/N1.5-C, SA-Fe/N3-C and SA-Fe/N4.5-C. Their weight percentages were 0.80 wt%, 0.78 wt% and 0.76 wt%, respectively. Unless otherwise mentioned, these samples used in the following sections were pointed to that pyrolyzed at 700 ℃ under argon. Synthesis of Fe/N-C and N-C. The N-doped carbon supported iron nanoparticles catalyst (Fe/N-C) was prepared by similar method as that of SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts. Nevertheless, the preparation of Fe/N-C, in comparison with SA-Fe/Nx-C, presented the absence of 110-phenanthroline ligand. The preparation process of N-C was similar to that of SA-Fe/Nx-C, with the exception of the absence of acetate iron. Synthesis of Fe2O3/C3N4 . The Fe2O3/C3N4 was prepared by conventional impregnation method. g-C3N4 (3 g) was added to acetate iron aqueous solution (0.5 mmol), with a magnetic stirring for 12 h at room temperature. After removal of water, the solid mixture was dried at 120 °C overnight, followed by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h under air. Finally, the brown powders were obtained."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation at an operating condition of 40 kV and 40 mA. N2 physical adsorption tests were carried out at 77 K on a JW-BK-122W analyzer. The specific surface areas and pore size distributions were based on Brunanuer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BEH) method, respectively. Prior to tests, all samples were degassed at 200 °C for 2 h under vacuum. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a JSM-7900 F scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy-diffusive spectroscopy (FlatQuad 5060 F, EDS). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded by a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin transmission electron microscopy operated at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images (HAADF-STEM) were collected on the same device. The sub-ångström-resolution HAADF-STEM images were acquired by a spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-ARM200 F) operated at 200 kV. The iron contents of samples were decided by Thermo iCAP 6300 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed by using a Kratos AXIS ULTRA DLD X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The binding energies obtained were calibrated by adventitious carbon (C1 s =284.5 eV). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were taken on a Thermo Escalab 250Xi spectrometer with HeI irradiation at hv =21.21 eV. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were conducted on a Bruker EMXPLUS10/12 EPR spectroscopy operated at X-band with a frequency of 9.8 GHz at ambient temperature."
4,Activity evaluation,"2.3 Activity evaluation Catalytic reactions were tested in a sealed Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) with an internal thermocouple. Typically, 10 mg of catalyst, 0.12 mmol of substrate and 10 mL of solvent were loaded into the autoclave. The autoclave was purged with O2 for 5 times to clean the air, and then charged with 1.0 MPa O2. The autoclave was heated to desired temperature under magnetic stirring for alcohol oxidation reactions. After reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature, and the products were extracted by ethyl acetate (5 mL). The resulting products were analyzed qualitatively by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with HP-5 MS column, in which the anisole was used as internal standard for quantitative calculation."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Surface morphology and structure of the SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts,"3.1 Surface morphology and structure of the SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts The synthesis process of the SA-Fe/Nx-C was shown in Fig. 1 a, in which g-C3N4 was used as structure-directing agent to guide the formation of N-doped graphitic carbon anchored single-atom Fe with lamellar structure upon high-temperature pyrolysis. The SEM and TEM images of SA-Fe/Nx-C (SA-Fe/N1.5-C, SA-Fe/N3-C and SA-Fe/N4.5-C) were exhibited in Fig. 1b and c and Fig. S1, and it is clear that the thin lamellar structure was successfully fabricated and there were no Fe NPs observed on it. The XRD patterns further corroborated that the SA-Fe/Nx-C showed only carbon characteristic peaks at around 26° and 43°, and no other diffraction peaks in relation to Fe-based species in Fig. 1d. In combination to TEM and XRD, one can say that metallic Fe was highly dispersed onto N-doped carbon matrix. The specific surface area and pore structure were taken by N2 physical adsorption. From N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms in Fig. 1e, each of them showed the classic line type of IV curves, along with H1 hysteresis loop, meaning the formation of mesoporous structure on SA-Fe/Nx-C [33]. The specific surface areas of catalysts were obtained, that is, 145.7 m2/g (SA-Fe/N4.5-C), 118.1 m2/g (SA-Fe/N3-C) and 84.7 m2/g (SA-Fe/N1.5-C), and the mesopore size was centered at around 3.8 nm in Fig. S2. It's worth mentioning that catalyst support and/or catalytic material with lamellar structure can be beneficial to the enhancement of catalytic activity, mainly due to the excellent physicochemical property such as the reduced diffusion limitation as well as the high exposure of catalytically active sites [34–36]. To illustrate the atomically dispersed Fe on N-doped carbon, the sub-ångström-resolution HAADF-STEM was carried out to detect the dispersed Fe species. All of SA-Fe/N1.5-C, SA-Fe/N3-C and SA-Fe/N4.5-C exhibited ultrathin nanosheet structure (in Fig. 2 a, c, e), on which there were no conspicuous Fe NPs or clusters recorded. Many highly scattered bright spots with atomic scale were observed clearly based on Z-contrast (in Fig. 2b, d, f), and that were attributed to iron atoms. EDS mapping images revealed that Fe, N, and C were homogeneously dispersed onto the whole architecture shown in Fig. 2g and Fig. S3. The reason for the atomically dispersed Fe anchored on N-doped carbon was derived from the nitrogen-containing ligand, where Fe atoms were captured into the framework of the N-doped carbon matrix by coordination with N atoms. To illustrate the effect of pyrolyzing temperature on the dispersed Fe species, TEM images of the SA-Fe/N4.5-C catalyst (pyrolyzed at 800 °C) were also filmed in Fig. 3 a and Fig. S4a, b. The result exhibited that large nanoparticles were acquired in a wide size range, indicating that high-temperature pyrolysis at 800 °C led to the formation and even aggregation of Fe-based NPs. As shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S4c, EDS line scanning and XRD pattern further testified that metallic Fe and Fe3C species were formed through high-temperature pyrolysis at 800 °C. The Fe/N-C catalyst, without the addition of 110-phenanthroline ligand in the process of preparation, presented larger Fe NPs (the particle size over 100 nm) by TEM images in Fig. 3c and d, meaning the serious sintering of Fe NPs. The XRD pattern of Fe/N-C also unveiled the fact of Fe NPs sintering in Fig. S5. In light of the comparison between SA-Fe/N4.5-C and Fe/N-C, the 110-phenanthroline served as chelating agent and was responsible for anchoring Fe atoms [19,22], by which atomically dispersed Fe was accomplished during high-temperature pyrolysis. The chemical state and local environment of single-atom Fe are extremely crucial to the catalytic activity. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were therefore employed to probe the metal coordination environment, and at the same time to discern the configuration of SA-Fe/Nx-C. XANES curves displayed that the Fe k-edge absorption of SA-Fe/N4.5-C was positioned between Fe and Fe2O3, and the pre-edge of SA-Fe/N4.5-C was similar to that of Fe2O3, both of which were higher than those of Fe foil and Fe/NC samples because of a shift to higher energy between 7110 eV and 7115 eV in Fig. 4 a. According to the results, it was suggested that metal Fe existed in the form with trivalent state in N-doped carbon [37,38]. In addition, the pre-edge peak located at 7113.4 eV was viewed as the fingerprint of Fe3+ along with a square-planar Fe-N4 configuration. The formation of pre-edge was originated from extranuclear electron transition from 1 s to 3d orbit of Fe due to the same symmetry of 3d orbits and 4p orbits [23]. It should be noted that the electron transition (1 s → 3d) is usually prohibited because of the incompatible orbit symmetry. It was thanks to the low symmetry of four coordination of Fe that the electron of 1 s orbit could transit to the 3d orbits, forming the Fe-N4 structure. The Fourier-transformed (FT) extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) spectra of k3-weighted Fe K-edge of samples further revealed that there was only a predominant peak for SA-Fe/N4.5-C observed at 1.46 Å, which was assigned to the first coordination shell of Fe (Fe-N) in Fig. 4b [39]. In comparison to SA-Fe/N4.5-C, Fe/NC showed typical Fe-Fe coordination peak, in accordance with Fe foil reference; however, the Fe2O3 reference presented Fe-O coordination characteristic peak, except for Fe-Fe coordination peak. Combining the sub-ångström-resolution HAADF-STEM, XANES and EXAFS, it was proclaimed that Fe atoms were atomically dispersed on the whole skeleton of N-doped carbon, on which Fe atoms were anchored by coordination with adjacent N atoms so as to reach the most stable state. To better interpret the coordination configuration of Fe, K-edge EXAFS fitting was performed to attain the structure information, and the fitting curves were displayed in Fig. 4c,d and Fig. S6. From the fitting data shown in Table S1, the coordination number of Fe and N was 4 and the average bond length of FeN was 2.06 Å, indicating that the center Fe atom was anchored by four N atoms. From XANES spectra and Fourier transforms of Fe K-edge, it is corroborated that Fe atoms were adequately coordinated with N atoms doped on carbon matrix, resulting in strong electronic interaction between Fe atoms and adjacent N atoms. To disclose the origin, XPS spectra were also carried out to characterize the element composition and elemental valence state. As shown in Fig. S7a, the SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts were composed of Fe, O, N and C elements. Fig. 5 a showed that the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 peaks of SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts located at around 710.8 eV was attributed to the trivalent iron (Fe3+) [40,41], in accordance with that of Fe3+ in Fe2O3/C3N4 (Fig. S7b), higher than that of Fe° in Fe/N-C. The SA-Fe/N4.5-C catalysts pyrolyzed at 600 °C and 800 °C pyrolysis also presented Fe 2p peaks of Fe3+ in Fig. S7d and S7e. This circumstance was further verified by EPR spectra. As shown in Fig. S8, the spectral splitting factor g was identified as 4.24, which could be classified as the high-spin Fe3+species in Fe-N4 site [19]. The results were highly consistent with the XANES spectra as well as the corresponding Fourier transforms of Fe K-edge. Besides, the Fe 2p3/2 peaks shifted to higher binding energy with the increase of N content in SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts. It should be mentioned that the electronic property of carbon can be remarkably changed by introducing N dopant to the framework, and meanwhile carbon defect sites are constructed, contributing to the enhanced electronic transmission performance. Such a charged body which combines with metals is bound to produce significant impact on the catalytic performance of metal catalysts. In the case of SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts, metal Fe was dispersed on N-doped carbon in the form of atom level, on which these atomically dispersed Fe intimately integrated with N-doped carbon. That is, a four-coordinated configuration between Fe atoms and N atoms was formed. Taking into consideration on the special heterostructure of SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts, the close interaction of Fe and N-doped carbon could be interpreted by Mott-Schottky contact, a semiconductor physics concept. When metal encounters with semiconductor, a functionalized interface with rectifying characteristics is formed [42,43], where electrons are rearranged to create a new realm because of the unequal work functions of metal and semiconductor. In terms of carbon, the band gap is gradually broadened by increasing the content of N dopant. As a result, the valence band top is close to the Fermi energy level, thus leading to the p-type semiconductor. Simultaneously, the work function of N-doped carbon is easily subjected to being altered by N doping. The N-rich carbon with a p-type semiconductor, a relatively high work function in comparison to that of metal Fe, has the ability of accepting electrons from metal Fe when these two heterogeneous mediums come into contact. In view of SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts, the single-atom Fe was coordinated with four N atoms. On the basis of the Mott-Schottky contact, the electrons from single-atom Fe were transferred to adjacent N atoms doped on carbon support. As observed in Fig. 5b and c and Fig. S7c, N 1s peak located at around 397.9 eV were assigned to the pyridinic N [44], and gradually shifted to the low binding energy with the increase of N content, indicating that electron transfer from metal Fe to N-doped carbon occurred. Note that the increased N content could promote electronic transfer, namely, the electron transfer from metal Fe to adjacent N and then to the whole carbon body by conjugate delocalization between the lone electron pair of nitrogen atoms and sp2 hybridized carbon skeleton. From XPS results, the electron transfer from single-atom Fe to the adjacent N was vividly described as in Fig. 5d."
7,Catalytic reactions,"3.2 Catalytic reactions The oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was conducted over SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts. As listed in Table 1 , oxidation of benzyl alcohol could not be performed without the presence of catalyst over a 24 h run (Entry 1). When the SA-Fe/N1.5-C catalyst was used for this reaction (Entry 2), the conversion of benzyl alcohol attained 73.4 %, and the selectivity of benzaldehyde was up to 91.6 %. Furthermore, benzoic acid, which was formed from the overoxidation of benzyl alcohol, acquired 8.4 % selectivity. With the increase of nitrogen content in SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts, the benzyl alcohol oxidation was promoted. The conversion of benzyl alcohol was increased to 92.7 % on SA-Fe/N4.5-C catalyst (Entry 4), higher than that of 79.3 % on SA-Fe/N3-C catalyst (Entry 3). Meanwhile, the benzaldehyde selectivity also obtained the highest value 96.4 % on the SA-Fe/N4.5-C catalyst. As reaction time was shortened to 16 h, 8 h and then to 4 h, the conversion of benzyl alcohol decreased to 73.1 %, 63.6 % and 40.1 %, while the selectivity reached around 100 % (Entry 5–7). The TOF values over SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts were calculated. The SA-Fe/N4.5-C gained as high as 8.8 h−1 at 4 h reaction, which was higher than those of 0.57 h−1 (single-atom Fe, Entry 17), 3.31 h−1 (single-atom Cu, Entry 18) and 0.51 h−1 (single-atom Co, Entry 19) reported by precious studies [20,45]. The results indicated that single-atom SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts effectively catalyzed benzyl alcohol oxidation to generate benzaldehyde. The excellent catalytic performance could be ascribed to the regulation of nitrogen dopant (see below). For comparison, the Fe/C-N and SA-Fe/N4.5-C (pyrolyzed at 800 °C) were employed for benzyl alcohol oxidation, as they presented large Fe nanoparticles. The conversions of benzyl alcohol over Fe/C-N and SA-Fe/N4.5-C (pyrolyzed at 800 °C) catalysts were 26.7 % and 67.4 % (Entry 8, 9), respectively, all of which were lower than SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts (pyrolyzed at 700 °C). The main reason for the enhanced catalytic activity on SA-Fe/Nx-C catalysts were mainly attributed to the atomically dispersed iron, on which more catalytically active sites were exposed to reaction system in comparison to Fe nanoparticles and thus led to high activity. The SA-Fe/N4.5-C (pyrolyzed at 600 °C) showed unsatisfactory catalytic activity, a low conversion of benzyl alcohol with 3.1 % being obtained (Entry 10). As shown in XRD profile (Fig. S4d), the SA-Fe/N4.5-C precursor was not able to be pyrolyzed effectively at 600 °C, meaning that the thin graphene lamellar structure of N-doped carbon anchored Fe (Fe-N4) could not be fabricated and even the Fe species could not be reduced to metallic Fe. XPS result also affirmed that the Fe species on SA-Fe/N4.5-C (pyrolyzed at 600 °C) existed in the form of Fe3+ rather than Fe° (in Fig. S7d), due to the low pyrolysis temperature. In addition, Recently, N-doped nanotube or graphene presented excellent catalytic performance in benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, which was assigned to the synergetic coordination of N doping, oxygen-containing groups and graphene skeleton in activating oxidant [46,47]. However, N doped carbon (NC) without the metal Fe, in this work, was tested for benzyl alcohol oxidation, and it gave negligible 2.2 % conversion of benzyl oxidation (Entry 11). Fe powders were also used as reference catalyst in this reaction, and an only 0.7 % conversion of benzyl alcohol was achieved (Entry 12). Commercial Pd/C catalyst, however, exhibited total conversion of benzyl alcohol (Entry 13), but the selectivity of benzaldehyde was as low as 39.1 %, which was due to the over-oxidation on metallic Pd active sites. In generally, iron oxide-based catalysts have catalytic performances in benzyl alcohol oxidation. Therefore, C3N4 supported Fe2O3 reference catalyst (Fe2O3/C3N4) was comparatively tested in this reaction. Unfortunately, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was very low, with only 2.8 % (Entry 14). Moreover, benzyl alcohol oxidations were carried out in various solvents other than water. As displayed in Table S2, solvent posed important role in converting benzyl alcohol, and the conversion of benzyl alcohol was improved to 100 %, together with a high selectivity of benzaldehyde at around 98.3 % in p-methylbenzyl alcohol. The influence of solvent on benzyl alcohol conversion might be linked to the polarity, molecular structure and absorption ability of solvent. To illustrate the catalytic function of Fe active sites on benzyl alcohol oxidation, the poisoning experiment of SA-Fe/N4.5-C catalyst was implemented using potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) as toxicant, as SCN− ions exhibited strong chelating ability to metal. As a result, Fe active sites were deactivated because of the formation of Fe- SCN− ligands. It was particularly worth mentioning that the mesopores fabricated ensured the smooth passage of SCN− ions into the Fe active sites, thus leading to the adequate interaction between Fe and SCN− ions. In this poisoning test, the SA-Fe/N4.5-C treated by KSCN (20 and 40 times relative to Fe, molar weight) gained 54.2 % conversion (Entry 15) and 32.4 % conversion (Entry 16) of benzyl alcohol, respectively. The results stated clearly that Fe active sites were availably poisoned by KSCN with which to cover the active sites and weaken the interaction of Fe and N-doped carbon, consequently decreasing the catalytic activity. A consensus has been reached in nitrogen-doped carbon that the introduction of nitrogen can strikingly enhance the electrical conductivity, change the structure, and modulate the acid-base property of carbon itself due to the high electronegativity of nitrogen [48,49]; for instance, N doping creates more surface defect sites so as to increase active sites of carbon. In addition to this, the basic groups formed strongly interact with active metals by which to be beneficial for the distribution of active metals on the surface of N-doped carbon. In view of this, the strong interaction between metal and N-doped carbon will has a significant effect on catalytic activity and product selectivity, because electron transfer takes place between the two heterogeneous mediums. The introduction of metallic Fe into the N-doped carbon, due to the distinction of their work functions, was bound to trigger electron redistribution on a metal-semiconductor boundary by electron transfer, during which N-doped carbon with larger work function could accept electrons from Fe [50]. Li et al. reported that the work function of metal Pd NPs gradually decreased with a decrease of particle size, so that the contact of smaller Pd NPs with N-doped carbon made more electron transfers from Pd NPs to N-doped carbon [42]. Even though single-atom Fe is different from Fe NPs, its combination with N dopant by a FeN4 configuration promoted electron transfer of itself. The related research [51] was also reported by Du et al. Therefore, before elaborating electron transfer, UPS spectra were employed to calculate the work functions of SA-Fe/NxC samples. The work functions were obtained by Einstein photoelectric law (Φ = hv - (Ecutoff - EF), hv =21.21 eV), in which hv, Ecutoff and EF represent the incident photon energy, the low kinetic energy cutoff edge and the Fermi energy level. Seen from Fig. 6 a and b, the work function was gradually increased with the increase of N concentration on SA-Fe/NxC, them of which being 11.37 eV of SA-Fe/N1.5C, 11.54 eV of SA-Fe/N3C and 12.64 eV of SA-Fe/N4.5C, separately. N doping made the energy band structure of carbon get distinct change. However, for carbon, especially graphene with sp2 hybridization, its electron density of states (DOS) near Fermi level is very low, making it become chemically inert [52]. By introducing nitrogen heteroatoms into carbon support, its local electronic state redistributes, contributing to high reactivity. XPS valance band spectra of SA-Fe/N4.5C and NC samples were performed to reveal the DOS in Fig. 6c. In a contrast, the peak (0 ∼ 5 eV) of N lone pair and delocalized 2pπ electron on CN was weaker than that of SA-Fe/N4.5C, indicating that after metallic Fe was incorporated into N-doped carbon, DOS was significantly enhanced [18]. The result further corroborated that electron transfer occurred from metallic Fe to N-doped carbon support. In order to strengthen the understanding of Mott-Schottky contact, Fig. 6d displays the before and after contact of metallic Fe and N-doped carbon. N-doped carbon, seen as p-type semiconductor, possesses higher work function compared to that of metallic Fe. When two heterogeneous mediums contacted, electrons from metallic Fe transferred to N-doped carbon. Until their Fermi levels reached equilibrium, the electrons were no longer transferred. Although single-atom Fe possessed low charge density, by tuning N content on carbon, electrons transferred from atomically dispersed Fe to N-doped carbon inevitably by electron delocalization on whole carbon. Because of the regulatable low charge density of atomically dispersed Fe, SA-Fe/NxC catalysts presented highly selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to produce benzaldehyde. In particular, the SA-Fe/N4.5C catalyst with high N content exhibited the best catalytic activity and benzaldehyde selectivity. The essential reason might be regarded as the low charge density with which to moderate selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Based on the Fe active sites, the reaction process of benzyl alcohol oxidation was proposed that the adsorbed ArCH2 OH molecules bonded with single-atom Fe to form intermediate Fe−OCH2-Ar species and H, and then α-H on Ar−CH2O-Fe was further dissociated to form benzaldehyde, as shown in Fig. 6e."
8,Catalytic stability test,"3.3 Catalytic stability test For supported-metal catalysts, metal active sites play important role for catalytic activity and catalytic stability, because they are susceptible to sintering, aggregation and even leaching under reaction conditions. Single-atom catalysts, due to high disperse of metal active sites on support, have generally been seen as unstable existence. To investigate the catalytic stability, the SA-Fe/N4.5C catalyst was examined. Fig. 7 a showed the catalytic behavior of SA-Fe/N4.5C catalyst over recycling tests for benzyl alcohol oxidation. Obviously, SA-Fe/N4.5C displayed good catalytic stability, without deactivation after five reaction runs. Benzyl alcohol conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity over SA-Fe/N4.5C were kept at around 92 % and 93 %. The good reusability benefited from itself stable structure and chemical property. HAADF-STEM image of the spent SA-Fe/N4.5C disclosed that metallic Fe was dispersed atomically onto the N-doped carbon skeleton. There were no agglomerated particles formed in Fig. 7b. To illustrate this, XRD profile showed that diffraction peaks revolving in Fe, FeCx and FeOx phases were not detected in Fig. 7c, further indicating that single-atom Fe was strongly fastened on N-doped carbon by coordinating with N atoms after reaction with five times. XPS spectra exhibited similar photoelectronic peaks of Fe and N as that of the fresh one in Fig. 7d. Atomically dispersed Fe still kept stable state by interaction with N dopants, achieving electron transfer from Fe to N and then the formed Fe3+. The stable coordination geometry, along with the special electronic property, could be responsible for the excellent catalytic stability as well as the moderate benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, a N-containing ligand, along with carbon nitride ferric salt, were employed to synthesize N-doped carbon supported single-atom Fe catalyst with graphene-like lamellar structure. Atomically dispersed Fe was successfully anchored by coordinating with N atoms under high-temperature pyrolysis. XANES and Fe K-edge EXAFS as well as XPS spectra indicated that a single-atom Fe was bonded with four N atoms, to form FeN4 configuration. The prepared single-atom SA-Fe/NxC catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity and product selectivity in benzyl alcohol oxidation as compared to that of N-doped carbon supported Fe NPs catalyst. The reason for the enhanced catalytic performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of highly dispersed Fe active sites and its electronic interaction with adjacent N atoms. In this synthesis strategy, carbon nitride was used as nitrogen source to regulate the nitrogen content doped into carbon, through which the electron transfer of Fe could be properly controlled. The electron transfer from metal Fe to coordinated N atoms and then to N-doped carbon led to the electron deficiency of metal Fe, contributing to the mild oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde."
