0,Introduction,"Wound dressings should be able to protect the wounds from traumas, dirtiness and microorganisms contamination, and simultaneously be comfortable and easy to remove without causing damages to the wounds (Biranje et al., 2019). Although different wounds need different types of dressings (Jaffe and Wu, 2019), the ideal dressing must be biocompatible, non-toxic and non-allergenic, resist to sterilization and maintain the humidity at wound site while removing excess exudate. Hydrogel dressings provide a non-adherent protection barrier that facilitates autolytic debridement of necrotic tissue and supplies moisture to the wound surface (Jaffe and Wu, 2019). They are also excellent drug delivery platforms, allowing a controlled release of active pharmaceutical ingredients (Dreiss, 2020; Pimenta et al., 2016). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been widely used as main component of wound dressing hydrogels. The blend with natural polymers, such as chitosan (Ch), may improve significantly the material’s properties (e.g. swelling ability, elasticity and thermal stability) (Abbasian et al., 2019) and favors the wound healing ability. Ch is a polycationic polymer, with known bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties, which can act through a wide range of mechanisms against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that generally colonize wounds, namely Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (Bowler et al., 2001; DeLeon et al., 2014; Keirouz et al., 2020). Cascone et al. (Cascone et al., 1999) prepared PVA/Ch hydrogel membranes by freeze–thawing (FT) for wound dressings and found that high amounts of Ch impaired the formation of PVA crystallites, which resulted in a material with a less regular structure and a more porous filamentous matrix. Yang et al. (Xiaomin Yang et al., 2008) produced PVA/Ch hydrogel membranes using gamma-irradiation followed by FT and observed that they displayed larger swelling capacity, higher mechanical strength, lower water evaporation, and higher thermal stability than those made by FT alone or FT followed by irradiation. Sung et al. (Sung et al., 2010) made minocycline loaded PVA/Ch hydrogel films with an enhanced healing effect and showed that high Ch amounts decreased the gel fraction, mechanical properties, and thermal stability, but increased the swelling ability, water vapor transmission, elasticity, and porosity of the materials. The incorporation of minocycline did not affect the hydrogel properties, but the Ch content strongly affected protein adsorption and drug release. The promising results obtained until now with PVA/Ch dressings led us to investigate the possibility of incorporating antiseptics to achieve a convenient and cost-effective solution for prevention and therapy of wound infections (Roberts et al., 2017). Antiseptics were chosen instead of antibiotics because they have multiple mechanisms of action and a broader spectrum of activity, they are practically unaffected by antimicrobial resistance and less likely to cause allergic reactions. Chlorhexidine (CHX) and polyhexanide (PHMB) (Fig. 1 ) are among the most used antiseptics in topical wound treatment and are recommended in situations where prolonged contact times with the drugs are required (Koburger et al., 2010). Both drugs are active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi and yeasts and act by disrupting the cell membrane of the microorganisms, leading to the leakage of the intracellular contents. The objective of this work was to develop a wound dressing made of a PVA/Ch hydrogel to be applied on wounds with low level of exudate production, with the ability to release antiseptics for infection control. PVA/Ch hydrogels with two distinct compositions were produced and studied regarding their surface morphology, degradation over time, mechanical properties and hydrophilicity. CHX and PHMB were loaded into the developed materials and their release profiles were evaluated using Franz diffusion cells, a widely used methodology to assess the in vitro drug release behavior. The effect of steam heat sterilization on the materials’ properties and drug release was also investigated. The most promising systems were evaluated concerning their biocompatibility, cytotoxicity and the antibacterial activity. Finally, the in vivo efficacy of the best system was accessed through a case study with a dog."

Distilled and deionised (DD, 18 MΩcm, pH 7.7) water was obtained with a Millipore system."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Hydrogels preparation Two hydrogel formulations with different mass ratios of PVA and chitosan, 1:1 and 3:1, were prepared, with a total concentration of the polymers in solution of 5% (w/v). For that, PVA was first dissolved in DD water using a magnetic stirrer with heating at 90 °C for 1.5 h. Then, an adequate amount of chitosan was added and the mixture was left 2 h under stirring for homogenization. Acetic acid was also added for a final concentration of 1% (v/v), as it favors the solubilization of chitosan. After degassing overnight, the solutions were poured into glass molds, frozen at −20 °C for 18 h and then thawed at room temperature for 6 h. Five freeze-thawing cycles were performed. The samples were then soaked in DD water for 24 h, in order to remove the soluble parts; water was changed two times, every two hours, in the first 4 h. The hydrated hydrogel slabs with 2 mm of thickness were cut into samples with adequate dimensions for each test using a punching device, frozen at −80 °C for one hour and then lyophilized for 24 h (Labtron Freezedryer model LBFD-A11) at an average temperature and pressure of −60 °C and 0.005 Pa. Rehydration of the samples was done before tests, when needed, by immersion in water DD for 72 h. 2.2.2 Hydrogels sterilization The lyophilized samples were sterilized in an autoclave (Uniclave 88 from AJC, Portugal), at 121 °C for 20 min. Eventual effects of sterilization on the properties of the material were assessed through the comparison of sterilized and non-sterilized samples. 2.2.3 Hydrogels characterization 2.2.3.1 Equilibrium swelling ratio and water content Lyophilized disks of the hydrogels (diameter 12 mm) were weighted to determine the dry weight and then put into falcons with 5 mL of DD water. Every 24 h, samples were blotted with absorbent paper and weighted. The procedure was repeated for 5 days. The equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR) and the equilibrium water content (EWC) were calculated as shown respectively in Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) ESR = W h - W d W d × 100 (2) EWC = W h - W d W h × 100 where Wh is the weight of the hydrated sample and Wd is the weight of the dry sample (El Salmawi, 2007). The experiments were performed in sextuplicate for each formulation. 2.2.3.2 Surface morphology Lyophilized samples of the hydrogels (disks of 12 mm of diameter) were coated with a film of gold/palladium using a sputter coater and evaporator (Polaron Quorum Technologies, United Kingdom). After coating, the surface morphology of the samples was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (Analytical SEM Hitachi S2400, Japan) with a light elements EDS detector (Bruker, USA). Micrographs were taken at different magnifications (80×, 200×, 1000×). 2.2.3.3 Thermotropic behavior The thermotropic behavior of the dried hydrogels was studied using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC 200 F3 Maia equipment (NETZSCH, Germany). Lyophilized samples were weighted (<2 mg) and placed in aluminum crucibles. One heating cycle between 20 °C and 250 °C with an intermediate cooling cycle was done with a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C/min. An empty crucible was used as reference. Experiments were performed in triplicate. The software NETZSCH Proteus Thermal Analysis was used to analyze the thermograms and determine the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the melting temperature (Tm) of the materials. 2.2.3.4 Enzymatic degradation A lysozyme solution (1 mg/mL) was prepared in PBS and filtered, through 0.2 μm syringe filters, into sterilized falcons (5 mL/falcon). Disks of the hydrated hydrogels (diameter 12 mm) were put inside the falcons in a flow chamber, which were closed and placed in a stirrer at 34 °C, 180 rpm. Samples were retrieved after the 24 h and 48 h, washed for 24 h in DD water and then lyophilized again for 24 h. The weight loss of the dried samples was calculated according to equation (3). (3) Weight L o s s ( d r y ) = W 0 - W 1 , 2 W 0 × 100 where W0 is the weight of the dried sample at the beginning of the experiment and W1 and W2 are the weight of the dried samples after having been immersed for 24 h and 48 h, respectively, in lysozyme solution (Qian et al., 2009). The experiments were performed in sextuplicate for each formulation. 2.2.3.5 Contact angle Contact angle measurements were performed through the captive bubble method, using a goniometer (Silva et al., 2020). Hydrated disks of the hydrogels (12 mm diameter) were mounted face down on a platform which was placed inside a quartz cell filled with DD water at room temperature. Air bubbles were created under the surface of the samples using an inverted syringe needle. Images of the bubbles were acquired with a video camera (jAi CV-A50, Spain) mounted on a microscope (Wild M3Z, Leica Microsystems, Germany) and analyzed with the software ADSA (Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis, Applied Surface Thermodynamics Research Associates, Toronto, Canada). The experiments were carried out in sextuplicate for each formulation. 2.2.3.6 Mechanical tests Compression and tensile tests were performed using a texturometer (TA.XT Texture Analyser, United Kingdom). The compression tests were carried out with hydrated disks of the hydrogels (12 mm diameter) using a compression speed of 0.05 mm/s and a target force of 47 N. For tensile tests, carried out at a speed of 0.05 mm/s up to a strain of ≈200%, hydrated rectangular samples (10 × 6 mm2) were used. The stress-strain curves obtained allowed calculation of the toughness of the material and the Young modulus (YM). In the compression tests, two ranges of strain were considered: 0–20% and 80–100%. 2.2.4 Drug loading and release Lyophilized hydrogel disks (16 mm diameter) were sterilized, weighted and put into falcons with 5 mL of loading solution. The concentration of 0.5 mg/mL of PHMB in PBS was chosen to prepare the loading solution, because in wound antisepsis, PHMB solutions are generally used at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.4 mg/mL (Kramer et al., 2019). Concerning CHX, a higher concentration was chosen (5 mg/mL). The choice of these different concentrations was based on the results of Koburger et al. (2010) who found that, when a prolonged contact time for antiseptic treatment is needed, PHMB was effective al lower concentrations than CHX. In fact, they determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of different microorganisms that can colonize wounds and observed that the maximum value of concentration required to inhibit or kill the most resistant test organism in the case of PHMB was 8 times lower than for CHX. CHX was solubilized in DD water because of its low solubility in saline solution (Silva et al., 2018). Loading was performed at 180 rpm and 36 °C for 24 h. In order to determine the total drug amount loaded, the methanol extraction method was carried out. The drug loaded disks were removed from the loading solution, carefully blotted and placed in glass flasks with 5 mL of methanol. At scheduled times, the disks were removed from the vials, rinsed with DD water, blotted and re-placed in fresh methanol, until no more drug was detected in the supernatant. The total amount of drug loaded was the sum of the determined values and was quantified as described below. Four measurements were carried out for each system. For the release measurements the drug loaded disks were taken from the solution, blotted and mounted in Franz cells (Fig. 2 ), to mimic the in vivo conditions, where only one side of the wound dressing is in direct contact with the skin/wound. The bottom chamber of the Franz cell was filled with PBS. The drug release experiments were conducted at 34 °C, with constant agitation of the release medium by a spiral connected to a magnet. The top side of the sample was exposed to air in a closed environment. At set times (30 min, 1 h, every hour till the 8th hour, and then, at 24 and 48 h), 200 µL aliquots of the release solution were collected from each cell and fresh PBS was added to compensate for the volume removed. The absorbance of the solutions (diluted if needed) was measured with a spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Multiskan Go, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), at 255 and 235 nm, for CHX and PHMB respectively, to determine the drug concentration and normalized cumulative mass released values were calculated. Calibration curves were obtained for each drug prior to the measurements. The experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. 2.2.5 Biocompatibility 2.2.5.1 Cytotoxicity Cytotoxicity experiments were performed with the hydrogel PVA/Ch 1:1 before and after loading with the drugs. Lyophilized samples with a diameter of 10 mm were sterilized and soaked for 24 h at 36 °C in 5 mL of different solutions: PBS, CHX (5 mg/ml in DD water) and PHMB (0.5 mg/mL in PBS). NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% of fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (10,000 U/mL of penicillin and 10 mg/mL of streptomycin) and culture conditions were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cytotoxicity assay was performed following ISO 10993-5:2009 guidelines. 3T3 cells were seeded at 1x105 cells/well in 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Prior to the experiment, the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium. The hydrogels were introduced in the Transwell® inserts and these were placed in the wells. An additional 100 μL of fresh DMEM was added to each insert to cover the hydrogel. DMSO (at 5% v/v) was used as cytotoxic positive control while DMEM was used for the negative control. Five replicates were considered for each group and experimental controls. Plates were then incubated for an additional 24 h and the MTT assay was used to establish the number of viable cells. After removing the inserts and the medium, the MTT solution (MTT dissolved in serum-free DMEM at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, from a stock solution of 5 mg/mL MTT in PBS) was added to each well, followed by a period of 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator, before dissolving formazan crystals in 4 mM HCl, 0.1% IGEPAL in isopropanol. The absorbance of the samples was then read at 595 nm using a microplate reader (AMP Platos R 496 AMEDA, AMP diagnostics, Austria) and cell viability was calculated subtracting the value correspondent to the blank and normalizing to the negative control. 2.2.5.2 Irritation with HET-CAM Hen’s egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) was used to determine the irritation potential of the hydrogel PVA/Ch 1:1 before and after loading with the drugs. Fertilized hen’s eggs were incubated for 8 days at 37 ± 0.5 °C and 60 ± 3% humidity and were automatically rotated by 90° once every 2 h in an HHD incubator (model YZ-56S, China). After incubation, the top of the eggs was cut with a rotary saw (Dremel 3000, Dremel®, USA), the eggshell was removed and the inner membrane was hydrated for 30 min using a 0.9% NaCl solution. The chorioallantoic membrane was exposed by removing the inner membrane. Sterilized drug loaded and unloaded disks (12 mm diameter) of the hydrogel were placed directly on the CAM. Negative and positive controls were obtained by using respectively NaCl (0.9%) and NaOH (1 M) solutions (300 μL) instead of the disks. The eggs were analyzed for 5 min to spot the occurrence of any lysis, hemorrhaging and coagulation. Experiments were done in triplicate. 2.2.6 Antibacterial properties The antibacterial activity of PVA/Ch 1:1 disks, unloaded and loaded with CHX and PHMB, was tested against S. aureus (ATCC 25923) and S. epidermidis (CECT 231). The bacteria’s culture medium was prepared by adding 38 g of Mueller-Hinton Agar to 1 L of DD water. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C, 20 min, 1 bar, and stabilized at 50 °C in a water bath. The bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and then the density of the inoculum was adjusted to a turbidity of 1 McFarland (3 × 108 bacteria/ml) for both bacteria by suspending the grow strains in 0.9% NaCl sterile solution. Culture square plates (120 × 120 mm2) were filled with 50 mL of Mueller-Hinton Agar and 350 μL of the bacterial suspension and left to dry. The drug loaded samples (diameter of 8 mm) were then carefully blotted with absorbent paper and directly placed on the agar. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and the inhibition formed halos were measured with an electronic caliper. Each assay was performed in triplicate for each bacterial strain. 2.2.7 Viscoelastic properties The dynamic viscoelastic behavior of sterilized PVA/Ch 1:1 hydrated hydrogels, both unloaded and loaded with PHMB, was studied using a parallel plate rheometer operating in rotation oscillation (Rheometer MCR 92) with the RheoCompass™ software. Plates with 25 mm diameter and a gap of 1 mm were used in the measurements. Amplitude sweeps were performed at low shear strains (<1%) to confirm the linearity of the storage modulus (G’) and the loss modulus (G”) and to determine their plateau values. A strain value was fixed within this region to obtain the dynamic frequency sweeps. G’, G” and the tangent of the loss factor (tan δ) were then determined in function of the angular frequency in the range between 0.1 and 100 rad/s. All experiments were carried at 34 °C, in quadruplicate. 2.2.8 In vivo case report A 2-year old female Labrador Retriever of 23 kg was taken to hospital due to skin problems. The dog presented an infected skin contact ulcer on the rear left limb with an approximated diameter of ≈25 mm, and two infected contact ulcers, close to each other on the rear right limb with an approximated diameter of ≈20 mm and 18 mm, all on the tarsus area. Daily dressings were performed on both members in the first week and each 2 days in the following 3 weeks. On the left tarsus a PHMB loaded PVA/Ch 1:1 dressing was applied, after disinfection with a commonly used disinfectant CHX solution. On the right tarsus was applied just a classic wet to dry dressing, after disinfection with the same solution of CHX. No systemic medication was administered. Both dressings were replaced daily during 21 days. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Instituto Superior Técnico – University of Lisbon (Ref n°27/2019). 2.2.9 Statistical analysis Quantitative results are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Normality of the results distribution was checked using the Shapiro–Wilk test. If normality was followed, comparisons between two means were carried out employing two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. Otherwise, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test were used. All statistical tests were carried out at a significance level of 0.05 using the statistics tool of Excel software."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Hydrogels characterization,"3.1 Hydrogels characterization The hydration process of sterilized and non-sterilized PVA/Ch 1:1 and PVA/Ch 3:1 disks was monitored for a period of 5 days, till equilibrium. By the end of the first day, all samples had swollen more than 98% in weight. The equilibrium values of swelling and water content for sterilized and non-sterilized samples are shown in Table 1 . Although the average ESR values obtained for PVA/Ch 1:1 samples are lower than for PVA/Ch 3:1, either before or after sterilization, the differences are not significant (sterile samples: p-value = 0.47, non-sterile samples: p-value = 0.16). Both samples displayed an extremely high swelling ratio (≈2000%), which decreased significantly upon sterilization (PVA/Ch 1:1: p-value = 0.0001, PVA/Ch 3:1: p-value = 0.0003). The tendency observed was not so evident when analyzing the values of water content. In fact, the average values of EWC before sterilization (≈95% for both materials) were only slightly higher than those after sterilization (≈93% for both materials), even though the differences were statistically significant (PVA/Ch 1:1: p-value = 0.00008, PVA/Ch 3:1: p-value = 0.0002). ESR and EWC values found in the literature for membranes made of PVA/Ch blends are either lower (Chakavala et al., 2012; El-Hefian et al., 2010; Nguyen and Liu, 2013) or comparable (Bano et al., 2014) to the ones here reported, depending on the composition of the hydrogels (e.g. concentration of the polymers), presence of crosslinkers, preparation conditions (e.g. temperature, methodology), among other factors. El-Hefian et al. (2010) observed that PVA/Ch films absorb a much higher amount of water than pure Ch or PVA films. They claimed that strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds are established between the amino groups of chitosan and the hydroxyl groups of PVA leading to physical entanglement of both PVA chains and Ch chains, which is responsible for the formation of a hydrogel network with increased water absorption capacity. Such high water contents is useful when hydrogel dressings are intended to provide a proper moist environment to a healing wound. Concerning the effect of sterilization, the decrease in the water absorption capacity could be justified by changes in the material’s microstructure. In fact, SEM images (Fig. 3 ) show that before sterilization, PVA/Ch 1:1 presents larger pores than PVA/Ch 3:1, which may explain the higher value observed for ESR. After sterilization, in both cases, a decrease in the porosity is observed and the materials became denser. Such densification should result from the high temperature (121 °C) to which the hydrogels were submitted during autoclaving. It is known that thermal treatments between the Tg and the Tm enhance polymer chains mobility, its alignment and the formation of crystallites by hydrogen bonding (Fukumori and Nakaoki, 2013; Hassan and Peppas, 2000). The DSC thermograms show that 121 °C falls in such interval of temperatures: for PVA/Ch 1:1 Tg = 81 ± 4 °C and Tm = 217 ± 1 °C; for PVA/Ch 3:1 Tg = 90 ± 2 °C and Tm = 216 ± 1 °C (see supplementary data, Fig. S1). The samples degradation was evaluated using a lysozyme solution to simulate the exudate fluid. Exudate composition may vary depending on the type of wound, but generally, it contains electrolytes, a high amount of proteins, essential nutrients for epithelial cells, and a number of inflammatory components, such as leukocytes, fibrinogen and fibrin (Cutting, 2003). Lysozyme is present at elevated levels (Cutting, 2003) and is one of the main enzymes involved in Ch degradation; it is able to hydrolyze Ch to oligomers or low-molecular species (Guarino et al., 2015). Results are shown in Table 1. Generally, PVA/Ch 1:1 disks present higher weight loss than PVA/Ch 3:1 in the same conditions (the only exception was for the sterilized samples, analyzed after 24 h). As expected, in all cases the weight loss increased with time. It must be stressed that, even after 48 h of experiment, the rate of degradation of both materials after sterilization did not exceed ≈2.5%, which is an important feature to ensure the integrity of the dressing when used in real wounds. Morphologically, PVA/Ch 1:1 non-sterilized samples present larger surface pores when compared to PVA/Ch 3:1, which means that the water access to the interior of the samples is easier in the former case, promoting the material’s dissolution. The larger content of chitosan in the PVA/Ch 1:1 samples may also explain the higher weight loss, due to the preferential attack of lysozyme to chitosan (Guarino et al., 2015). Sterilization decreases the degradation of PVA/Ch 1:1 hydrogels (p-value = 0.002 after 48 h), which should be related with the densification of the material after sterilization, and the associated loss of porosity and increase of the crosslinking degree. Contrarily, for PVA/Ch 3:1 no significant differences were found in the weight loss before and after sterilization (p-value = 0.16 after 48 h). From the results obtained and since hydrogel wound dressings must be changed each 1–2 days, eventual in situ adverse local effects are not expectable. The water contact angles of sterilized and non-sterilized PVA/Ch 1:1 and PVA/Ch 3:1 samples are presented in Table 1. Both materials are quite hydrophilic. The sterilization process did not affect significantly this characteristic (p-value = 0.724 for PVA/Ch 1:1 and p-value = 0.278 for PVA/Ch 3:1). The hydrophilic nature of the materials herein studied suggests a favorable interaction with the wound fluids, and is consistent with results found in the literature, where values between 24° and 60° are reported for PVA/Ch films and coatings (Chen et al., 2007; He and Xiong, 2012; Yang et al., 2007). These values are strongly influenced by factors such as the surface topography, sample’s composition and the method of measurement. In most cases, the reported contact angles were obtained with sessile drops and dry samples, instead of captive bubbles and hydrated samples used in this work, which better approaches the real situation for wet dressings. Hydrated samples of both hydrogels were submitted to compression and tensile tests, before and after sterilization. Average stress strain curves for each case are presented in Fig. 4 . The values for toughness and YM are gathered in Table 2 . For compression, since the curves present two distinct zones with different slopes, YM were determined for low strains (0–20%) and high strains (80–100%). This behavior results from the biphasic nature of the hydrogels, which contain a polymeric network impregnated with noncovalently bonded water. During the initial stages of compression (0–20% strain), the expulsion of water from the materials prevails (Pastorczak et al., 2009). The materials studied displayed similar toughness under compression, before and after autoclaving (p-value = 0.21 for PVA/Ch 1:1 and p-value = 0.31 for PVA/Ch 3:1). Regarding compressive YM, no statistically significant differences were found for each material at low strains. However, when strain increased to values between 80 and 100%, the materials became much stiffer. Sterilization further accentuated this characteristic (PVA/Ch 1:1: p-value = 0.008, PVA/Ch 3:1: p-value = 0.0001). Differences between the hydrogels are more evident in tensile tests. PVA/Ch 3:1 displays higher toughness and YM than PVA/Ch 3:1. Moreover, the effect of sterilization on the mechanical properties is clear: hydrogels toughness increases (PVA/Ch 1:1: p-value = 0.005, PVA/Ch 3:1: p-value = 0.03), as well as YM 0–20% (PVA/Ch 1:1: p-value = 0.0003, PVA/Ch 3:1: p-value = 0.048). From the analysis of the results, it is clear that both the increase in PVA content and autoclaving improved the mechanical resistance of the hydrogels. Other authors reached similar conclusions concerning the effect of PVA (Kim et al., 1992; Kouchak et al., 2014), which was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the OH− groups of PVA and NH3 + of Ch in acidic medium. Regarding the effect of autoclaving, the behavior observed was expected due to the materials densification referred above. Comparison with the literature is not straightforward since reported data refer to PVA/Ch blends that generally contain other additives and the testing conditions/methods vary among works. Even so, similar values were found by other authors for different types of wound dressings, both for YM obtained in compressive (He et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2012) and tensile tests (Blacklow et al., 2019) and for toughness at traction (Cai et al., 2016; Costa-Júnior et al., 2009). Data of tensile testing are the most common, because, under normal physiological conditions, the skin is under a state of tension, even in the absence of external loading. The mechanical properties of the developed hydrogels fall in the range of the values found for human skin (Fernandes et al., 2019), which ensure that they can be easily applied and removed and maintain the flexibility during the healing process."
6,Drug release,"3.2 Drug release The drug release experiments were carried out with sterilized PVA/Ch 1:1 and PVA/Ch 3:1 samples, since wound dressings contact open wounds directly, and their sterilization is mandatory to minimize the risks of infection. The normalized cumulative release curves of CHX and PHMB are represented in Fig. 5 . PHMB was released in a more sustained way than CHX, for both materials: while CHX release only lasts about 8 h, PHMB release extends for 2 days, being 80–90% of the drug released in the first 24 h. In order to evaluate the drug retention in each system, the total amount of drug loaded was compared with the total amount of drug released after 48 h (Table 3 ). The amount of CHX loaded was higher than that of PHMB, which is in agreement with the higher concentration of the CHX loading solution. Besides, the percentage of CHX retained is lower, independently of the type of sample. PVA/Ch 3:1 loaded larger amount of drugs than PVA/Ch 1:1 and retained higher fractions, indicating a stronger affinity between the drugs and PVA. The hydrogel PVA/Ch 1:1 was chosen to proceed with the biological tests, taking into consideration the physical properties of both formulations together with the drug release behavior. The choice was based on the fact that this formulation led to higher drug release when compared to PVA/Ch 3:1, both in absolute and percentual terms, although the mechanical properties were slightly inferior."
7,Biocompatibility,"3.3 Biocompatibility 3.3.1 Cytotoxicity Fig. 6 shows the NIH/3T3 fibroblasts viability of PVA/Ch 1:1 samples before and after loading with CHX and PHMB. The hydrogels hydrated in PBS have 100% viability, indicating that the bare material is non cytotoxic. This result is in agreement with what was found by other authors for different PVA/Ch dressings (Khorasani et al., 2018; Morgado et al., 2017). When the cells were exposed to CHX loaded samples, the cell viability dramatically diminished. The cytotoxicity observed is probably related with the high concentration of drug released. Similar results were obtained in numerous studies with different cell types in a time and dose dependent manner (Almazin et al., 2009; George et al., 2016; Giannelli et al., 2008; Mariotti and Rumpf, 1999). The samples loaded with PHMB presented slight cytotoxicity (average of 82% viability). However, it remained above the viability threshold of 70% (ISO 10993-5:2009). According to the literature, PHMB is much less toxic than CHX (Gerli et al., 2012; Hübner and Kramer, 2010; Uzer Celik et al., 2016). In fact, the therapeutic index 1 1 The therapeutic index is a quantitative measurement of the relative safety of a drug, which compares the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxicity. of PHMB, determined from the reason between LD50 (rat) and the MIC against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is more than 200 times higher than that of CHX (Hübner and Kramer, 2010). The reduction of cytotoxicity of CHX loaded samples could be eventually achieved by decreasing the drug concentration in the sample, but this could have repercussions in the material’s antimicrobial efficacy. 3.3.2 Irritation The HET-CAM test was used to predict the irritability potential of the materials on wounds. This is a simple and cost-effective method, complementary to cell viability tests, which is commonly used to pre-evaluate the toxicity of biomaterials before in vivo testing (Harnoss et al., 2019; Meenakshi and Gandhi, 2016; Spielmann, 1995). The results are depicted in Fig. 7 . Negative control showed no signs of lysis, hemorrhaging or coagulation, while in the positive control there was extensive hemorrhage. Membranes exposed to PVA/Ch 1:1 disks hydrated both with PBS and with PHMB solution show no particular reaction. However, the membrane which contacted the disks loaded with CHX was covered with a cloudy film, revealing slight irritability but without hemorrhage."
8,Antibacterial properties,"3.4 Antibacterial properties S. aureus and S. epidermidis were chosen to assess the antibacterial properties of the studied materials, since these are bacteria commonly associated to skin biofilm formation and wound infections (Brackman et al., 2013). PVA/Ch 1:1 sterilized disks hydrated with PBS, and loaded with CHX and PHMB, were submitted to agar diffusion tests with the referred bacteria. The results are presented in Fig. 8 . The material itself did not display antibacterial properties against the bacteria used in this assay. Although some authors have reached similar results for different PVA/Ch blends (Khorasani et al., 2018), contradictory reports on the antibacterial properties provided by the Ch can be found in the literature (Bano et al., 2014; Tahtat et al., 2011). The effect of Ch varies according to the bacteria studied and depends on the Ch molecular weight and its content in the wound dressing. In fact, the higher the chitosan content in the blend and the higher its molecular weight, the greater is the antibacterial effect (Tahtat et al., 2011). Regarding the drug loaded disks, those loaded with CHX displayed high efficacy against both S. aureus and S. epidermidis, while the PHMB loaded ones were effective against both bacteria, but originated smaller halos, which could be due to the significantly lower amount of PHMB being released when compared to CHX (Fig. 5)."
9,Viscoelastic properties,"3.5 Viscoelastic properties Wound dressing materials may be submitted to some strain if they are used on body surfaces, which are irregular and/or under movement. Therefore, they must be resistant and flexible. The degree of flexibility of the most promising dressing, PVA/Ch 1:1 and the effect of its loading with PHMB was determined by viscoelastic measurements. First, the variation of the storage (G') and the loss modulus (G'') was determined as function of the shear strain. Fig. 9 A shows that both parameters assume constant values in the studied strain range above 0.04%, for both unloaded and loaded hydrogels. In the linear viscoelastic region (LVER), rheological tests can be carried out without destroying the sample’s structure. Since G'>G'' in the whole range, the samples can be considered viscoelastic solids, presenting a gel-like or solid structure, independently of the presence of the drug (Ou et al., 2017). The strain amplitude of 0.5% was chosen to simulate slow motion on long timescales or at rest and to obtain the angular frequency sweep curves shown in Fig. 9B. It can be seen that G' remains almost constant and above G'' along the whole frequency sweep. An increase in G’’ with the angular frequency was observed, leading to an increase of the loss factor (tan δ = G’’/G’), which means that at higher frequencies, more energy is absorbed when the material deforms. The values of tan δ are low (<0.07) indicating that the complex shear modulus, G*, which reflects the overall resistance to deformation, has mainly an elastic contribution. The presence of the drug resulted in an increase of both G' and G'' compared to the unloaded samples. Besides, loaded samples show a lower tanδ indicating a higher elastic behavior than unloaded samples, which could be related with the decrease in the hydrogel swelling capacity in PHMB. In fact, ESR decreases from 1587 ± 85% in PBS to 1362 ± 34%, due to the presence of the drug. This should result from the binding of the drug to the hydrogel, which promotes some cross-linking and decreases the network mobility resulting in a higher storage modulus (Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2019). The information on the viscoelastic behavior of PVA/Ch wound dressing hydrogels is scarce. However, our values of G' and G'' lie, respectively within the ranges 101 to −105 Pa and 100–103 Pa, found for other hydrogels developed for this type of applications (Amri et al., 2018; Islam et al., 2013; Ou et al., 2017; Rahmani et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2004; X. Yang et al., 2008)."
10,In vivo case report,"3.6 In vivo case report Fig. 10 shows the results of the in vivo study with a dog. The wound treated with the PVA/Ch 1:1 dressings loaded with PHMB had a positive evolution and the larger ulcer (25 mm) and the healing process was completely resolved. On the other hand, the ulcers of the right limb, treated just with antiseptic and mechanical protection with a dry dressing, did not progress as quickly and, 28 days after initiating the treatment ulcerative lesions remained. The evolution of the wound treated with antiseptics and application of the dressing developed, suggests a greater effectiveness of the treatment when compared with the treatment of the contralateral limb. The product seemed to be efficient in the treatment of this ulcerative process, but further clinical studies need to be carried out in order to validate its effectiveness."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, two PVA/Ch hydrogel formulations (PVA:Ch mass ratios 1:1 and 3:1) intended to be used as drug-loaded wound dressings were developed. Both hydrogels were hydrophilic and presented high swelling and water retention capacity. Sterilization by autoclaving induced densification/crosslinking of the materials, which kept or improved their mechanical performance. The degradation rate of the materials in lysozyme solution was negligible. Samples were loaded with CHX and PHMB by soaking and submitted to drug release experiments in Franz cells to approximate real release conditions. A sustained CHX release was observed until the 8th hour for CHX, whereas for PHMB it occurred for more than 24 h. The amount of drug released was higher for PVA/Ch 1:1. Therefore, this material was chosen to proceed with the biological studies. The bare material revealed to be non-cytotoxic, did not induced irritability and had no antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Contrarily, CHX loaded disks presented a strong antibacterial action, but were cytotoxic and induced a slight irritation reaction in the HET-CAM test. Such behavior was attributed to the high concentration of CHX loaded and released and could be improved by reducing drug loading to reach an optimized release profile. The PHMB loaded hydrogel presented bacterial growth inhibition capacity for both strains studied, no irritation signs in the HET-CAM test and no toxic effect on the tested cell line. Additionally, the dressing demonstrated a gel-like behavior (G'>G''), mainly elastic and favoured by the presence of this drug, that enables the maintenance of its structural integrity. Dressings made with this hydrogel were applied in the treatment of a wound in a dog and revealed better performance than conventional treatment. In vivo studies with a larger number of animals are needed to validate the efficacy of the dressings developed."
