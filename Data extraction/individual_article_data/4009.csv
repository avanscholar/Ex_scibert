0,Introduction,"There is great interest in the use of cellulosic biomass as a renewable source of energy [4]. Microorganisms that produce cellulose and lignocellulose degrading enzymes can be used to hydrolyze this biomass and convert the bulk of the substrate into various fermentation end-products, including hydrogen (H2) [11,12]. Cellulose fibers are embedded in a complex, intertwined matrix of other structural biopolymers, primarily hemicelluloses and lignin, which account for 20–35% and 5–30% of plant dry weight, respectively [12]. Because of its diverse architecture and complex nature, cellulose hydrolysis has become the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cellulose to fuels. Biochemical analyses have been conducted on the cellulase systems of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi [11]. Some cellulolytic bacteria express a suite of cellulolytic enzymes that are assembled into a complex structure on the cell surface called a cellulosome [4,5,12]. The bacteria attach to cellulose particles via the cellulosome. Cellulases within the cellulosome act in a coordinated manner to efficiently hydrolyze cellulose to cellobiose and other soluble cellulodextrans [16]. The cellulases and cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum, a thermophilic, cellulolytic, obligate anaerobe have been studied extensively [4,5,12,16]. Also, C. thermocellum is known to possess some interesting fermentative properties cultured with different substrates like cellulose and hence, it has been evaluated for its ability to produce biofuels (ethanol and hydrogen) during fermentation of cellulosic substrates [9,11,12,13]. In the present paper, we describe the fermentative properties of a novel anaerobic, mesophilic, cellulose-degrading bacterium, Clostridium termitidis strain CT1112 [9]. C. termitidis was isolated from the gut of the wood-feeding termite Nasutitermes lujae, found in the Mayombe tropical rainforest in Congo, Central Africa. It is a mesophilic, obligate anaerobe, that can utilize cellulose, cellobiose, glucose, fructose, and many other sugar monomers, as a sole carbon source. In the initial characterization of the species, the fermentation end-products H2, carbon dioxide (CO2), acetate, and ethanol were reported, but the growth characteristics on cellulose or cellobiose were not described [9]. The objectives of this study were to characterize H2 production and end-product formation by C. termitidis strain CT1112 cultured in batch cultures containing cellobiose or α-cellulose. Cell growth, biomass accumulation (as measured by protein concentration), organic acid synthesis, changes in pH profiles, ethanol and H2 yields were measured and compared with those of Clostridium cellulolyticum, a mesophilic, cellulolytic, obligate anaerobe that has been characterized and studied extensively."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microbial source and media,"2.1 Microbial source and media C. termitidis CT1112 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), was cultured in 1191 medium [10] with cellobiose and α-cellulose at 37°C. All chemicals and reagents for media and substrates were obtained from Fisher Scientific with the exception of Bacto™ yeast extract, which was obtained form Becton, Dickinson and Company. To maintain fresh cells, C. termitidis was serially subcultured by transferring 10% (v/v) inoculum into 1191 media containing 2gl−1 cellobiose and α-cellulose. This complex medium contained (per liter of milliQ water): KH2PO4, 1.5g; Na2HPO4, 3.35g; NH4Cl, 0.5g; MgCl2.6H2O, 0.18g; yeast extract (BD 212750), 2.0g; resazurin (0.25mg/ml), 2.0ml; 10× vitamin solution, 0.50ml; 10× mineral solution, 1.00ml. Vitamin supplement and mineral elixir solutions were prepared according to Islam et al. [10]. Sodium disulfide (Na2S) at a concentration of 200mM was used as a reducing agent."
3,Experimental procedures,"2.2 Experimental procedures Balch tubes (Bellco Glass Co.) with a working volume of 27ml were used for all tests. To maintain an anaerobic and sterile environment, tubes containing 9ml fresh 1191 medium were air-sealed with butyl-rubber stoppers, crimped with aluminum seals, and gassed and degassed (1:4min) four times with 100% nitrogen (N2). 0.1ml of sterile Na2S (200mM) reducing solution was added and each tube was autoclaved [2]. Sterile, anaerobic cellobiose was added to a final concentration of 2.0gl−1. Two grams per liter α-cellulose powder was added to the Balch tubes containing 1191 medium, followed by gassing and degassing with the addition of 0.1ml of sterile Na2S (200mM) solution and the tubes were autoclaved. Tubes were inoculated (10% v/v) with fresh, mid-late exponential phase cultures (18–20h on cellobiose and 60–65h on α-cellulose) that had been serially subcultured twice prior to the initiation of the experiments. Balch tubes inoculated with C. termitidis were incubated for 39h at 37°C with cellobiose and 93h at 37°C with α-cellulose. During exponential phase, samples (1.0ml) were taken every 2h, based on an expected cell-doubling rate of approximately 6.5h on cellobiose. During the late log and stationary phase, samples were taken every 5h. The samples were taken every 8h throughout the experiment on α-cellulose. Three independent replicate samples were taken at each time point. 2.2.1 Cell growth and pH measurements For the cellobiose experiment, cell growth rates were determined by monitoring changes in optical densities at 600nm (OD600) using spectrophotometrical analysis (Biochrom, Novaspec II). The tubes were vortexed briefly and the values were measured within 3s while cells remained in suspension. All results were blanked against an environmental control that contained only 1191 medium with same concentration of reducing agent and cellobiose. For the α-cellulose experiment, the growth rate was determined based on the protein analysis done using a modification of the Bradford method [1]. Aliquots of cultures were dispensed into microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher Scientific) and centrifuged (IEC Micro-MB, International Equipment Company) at 10,000g for 10min to separate the pellets from the supernatants. The supernatants were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes and stored at −20°C for further end-product analysis. The pellets were re-suspended with 0.9% (wt/vol) sodium chloride (NaCl) and centrifuged for 10min. The supernatant was discarded and 1ml of 0.2M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added to re-suspend the pellets. Samples were incubated at 100°C in a water bath for 10min, and after cooling down, the supernatants were collected for Bradford analysis. Optical densities at 595nm (PowerWave XS, BIO-TEK) were measured until results stabilized, and then recorded. The pH of each tube was measured using a Sension2 pH ISE meter (Hach) outfitted with a ThermoOrion triode probe. 2.2.2 End-product analysis The supernatants were used for analyzing soluble end-products. A high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with an anion-exchange IonPac-AS11 analytical column (4×250mm) was used to measure acetate, lactate, and formate production (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Ethanol and glucose concentrations in the supernatants were measured using the UV-Test kit (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany). The ethanol content was based on the amount of NADH produced by alcohol dehydrogenase, measured by spectrophotometry at 340nm. The glucose concentrations were measured based on the amount of NADPH produced by hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, measured by spectrophotometry at 340nm. All end-product yields were determined [10]. 2.2.3 Gas measurements Gas (H2 and CO2) concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph (SRI Instruments, Model 8610C) capable of detecting concentrations between 200–500ppm and equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD). H2 analysis was conducted using a stainless steel (3.2mm×1.8m) column packed with a 13× molecular sieve while CO2 was analyzed using a stainless steel (3.2mm×1.8m) column packed with silica gel. Gases were collected and quantified according to Islam et al. [10]. Gas phase and aqueous phase concentrations [14] were determined for both gases, including the fraction of bicarbonate found in CO2 analysis [3]."
4,Results,
5,Growth characteristics,"3.1 Growth characteristics Cell growth (based on OD600 values) and protein concentration of C. termitidis on 1191 medium containing 2gl−1 cellobiose are shown in Fig. 1A. C. termitidis remained in exponential growth for 25h despite a significant drop in pH below 7.0 within the first 5h of the experiment (see Fig. 2 ). There was no initial lag observed as the cells were serially subcultured twice, with the same concentration of cellobiose in the medium, prior to inoculation of the test samples. Maximum cell concentration reached an OD600 of approximately 0.6 during late exponential phase. The doubling time for C. termitidis during exponential phase was found to be 6.5h, with all R 2 values exceeding 0.99. The protein concentration of C. termitidis on 1191 medium containing 2gl−1 α-cellulose is shown in Fig. 1B. The cells were in the exponential phase for a period of 75h. The growth curve was assessed and the generation time during exponential phase was calculated as 18.9h, with all R 2 values exceeding 0.98."
6,Gas production,"3.2 Gas production Plots of H2 and CO2 production by C. termitidis cultured on 2gl−1 cellobiose and α-cellulose, and corresponding changes in pH with respect to cultivation time, are shown in Fig. 2A and B. C. termitidis rapidly produced H2 within the first 10h of the experiment on cellobiose, where as on α-cellulose, H2 production was slightly lower within the first 10h. This is due to the fact that C. termitidis has a higher doubling time when cultured on cellobiose when compared to α-cellulose. Significantly reduced concentrations of production, however, coincided with a drop in pH below 7.0. A second shift in H2 production occurred when the pH fell below 6.2. The rate of H2 production on cellobiose and α-cellulose during exponential phase was 0.26 and 0.14mmolh−1 lculture−1, respectively. The maximum volumetric production rates were calculated based on the sum of the average individual rates obtained from four consecutive time points obtained during the mid and late exponential phase of growth. The rate of CO2 production was lower than H2, but the overall pattern of CO2 production was similar to that of H2 production. H2 and CO2 were synthesized even after the cells entered stationary phase, but the rates of synthesis were much lower. The rate of CO2 production on cellobiose during exponential phase was higher (0.33mmolh−1 lculture−1) than on α-cellulose (0.13mmolh−1 lculture−1). The maximum concentrations of H2 and CO2 during exponential phase were calculated based on the highest value of the average of the concentrations of individual triplicates measured at each time point. H2 and CO2 synthesis corresponded to cell growth. The growth pattern was characterized by a high production rates in early exponential phase that gradually decreased as it entered late exponential phase. The final concentrations of total H2 and CO2 produced on cellobiose were 4.6 and 5.6mmollculture−1, respectively, where as, on α-cellulose, the final concentrations were 7.7 and 6.9mmol lculture−1, respectively (Table 1 )."
7,Production of soluble end-products,"3.3 Production of soluble end-products The major end-products synthesized by C. termitidis during fermentation of cellobiose and α-cellulose were acetate, formate, ethanol and lactate. Fig. 3A and B plots the concentrations of end-product synthesized versus time. Acetate production was greater than formate, ethanol and lactate throughout the entire growth on both substrates. The rates and concentrations of acetate, formate, ethanol and lactate production from cellobiose were significantly higher during the logarithmic phase of growth and then plateaued after 25–30h when the cells reached the stationary phase. On α-cellulose, the rates and concentrations were consistently higher until 70–75h of log phase and then plateaued after 75h as soon as the cells reached the stationary phase. Lactate production followed a different pattern, when compared to other end-products synthesis. During the initial exponential growth, there was a significant lag in lactate production, which subsequently significantly peaked up after 8–10h on cellobiose and after 40h on α-cellulose. This metabolic shift in organic acids and ethanol production coincided with a drop in pH below 7.0, correspondingly affecting the rates of H2 production on both the substrates. Acetate, formate and ethanol concentrations plateaued when the cells entered the stationary phase on both the substrates, the pH observed at this point was 6.5. As the pH neared 6.2, organic acid and ethanol production declined substantially. Organic acid synthesis appeared to follow the same curve as cell growth during the exponential growth phase, and began to plateau as the cells entered stationary phase at 25–30h on cellobiose and 70–75h on α-cellulose. Lactate was produced throughout the latter stages of the experiment, its synthesis remained constant during the exponential phase of growth but began to decline after the cells reached stationary phase. Although, the maximum concentrations of ethanol were similar on both the substrates, the volumetric rate of ethanol production on cellobiose (0.18mmolh−1 lculture−1) was much higher than the rates obtained on α-cellulose (0.06mmolh−1 lculture−1), as expected from the differences in growth rate (Table 2). The maximum concentrations of acetate, formate, lactate and ethanol from cellobiose were 5.9, 4.2, 2.0 and 3.7mmollculture−1, respectively, where as the maximum concentrations from α-cellulose were 7.2, 2.9, 0.5 and 3.1mmollculture−1, respectively. Production of organic acids increased at relatively the same rate despite higher initial concentrations of acetate. Fermentation continued after 25–30h on cellobiose and 70–75h on α-cellulose because both acetate and formate synthesis continued at a constant rate until the stationary phase. Ethanol concentrations increased during log phase, but was synthesized at lower concentrations than acetate and formate, and declined during stationary phase on both the substrates. The maximum specific production rates were calculated based on the amount of end-products produced per hour between four consecutive time points and corresponding cell dry weight during mid to late exponential phase. The maximum specific production rates of H2, CO2 and ethanol production obtained during fermentation of cellobiose by C. termitidis were 4.28, 5.32, and 2.99mmolh−1 gdry weight−1 of cells, where as, on α-cellulose, the rates were 2.79, 2.59, and 1.1mmolh−1 gdry weight−1 of cells, respectively. The specific production rates of C. cellulolyticum on cellobiose were 1.59, 0.52, 1.0mmolh−1 gdry weight−1 of cells and on α-cellulose (3.9gl−1) were 1.73, 1.23, 1.43mmolh−1 gdry weight−1 of cells, respectively. The specific production rates of H2, CO2 and ethanol production (Table 3) in C. termitidis is higher than C. cellulolyticum on both the susbstrates [5,8]. The maximum volumetric production rates of H2, CO2 and ethanol production obtained during fermentation of cellobiose by C. termitidis were 0.26, 0.33 and 0.18mmolh−1 lculture−1, where as, on α-cellulose, the rates were 0.14, 0.13 and 0.06mmolh−1 lculture−1, respectively. End-product volumetric production and rates are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . Carbon balance during anaerobic fermentation of cellobiose and α-cellulose was calculated based on the concentrations of the end-products obtained, cell mass and substrates. The residual glucose levels measured during the initial and late exponential phase were minimal on both the substrates, indicating the complete utilization of the substrate (2gl−1). The overall oxidation/reduction (O/R) ratios during the exponential phase with time points showing maximum yields were 1.29 and 1.36 on cellobiose and α-cellulose, respectively. The overall carbon recovery of cellobiose fermentation by C. termiditis during the entire growth phase was 86.8%."
8,Discussion,"C. termitidis is a novel mesophilic bacterium that can produce H2 at a rate that is comparable to those of the mesophilc cellulolytic bacterium C. cellulolyticum [5]. C. cellulolyticum had a higher doubling time of 7h [7] and 24h [6] on cellobiose and α-cellulose, respectively, when compared to C. termiditis (Table 1). C. cellulolyticum produced the same end-products as C. termiditis during both cellulose and cellobiose fermentations, except that formate synthesis by C. cellulolyticum was not observed, and extracellular pyruvate synthesis was observed [5,8]. The synthesis of lactate and ethanol compete with H2 synthesis [11]. Lactate production was significantly higher in C. cellulolyticum [5] and ethanol production considerably lower than C. termiditis on both the substrates. The subsequent addition of cellulose resulted in the linear increase in the levels of the end-products formed during the anaerobic fermentation in C. cellulolyticum. Also, it was observed that lactate synthesis forced the carbon to flow towards acetate and ethanol, followed by a second metabolic shift from ethanol to acetate formation [5]. In C. termiditis, a second metabolic shift was observed with the drop in pH below 6.2 with ethanol to acetate formation and a downward trend of H2 to CO2 ratio, during late exponential phase. This indicates that H2 was produced by hydrogenase activity in addition to pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. The H2 synthesis by C. termiditis, however, appears to be more sensitive to pH change than C. thermocellum, a thermophilic bacterium that is extensively studied [9,10,14,15]. C. termitidis sensitivity to pH seems to trigger a shift to lactate production at a much higher pH than C. thermocellum. On cellobiose, C. cellulolyticum produced extracellular pyruvate, acetate and ethanol within 5–10h after inoculation, followed by lactate synthesis that corresponded with the maximum extracellular pyruvate production. Moreover, an increase in the specific rate of lactate synthesis coincided with reduced acetate, pyruvate and ethanol levels [8]. Pyruvate synthesis was not observed during the anaerobic fermentation of cellobioase by C. termitidis. Instead, formate was produced along with acetate, ethanol and lactate within 5–10h of growth and further end-product synthesis were similar to that of cellulose fermentation. During initial exponential phase, C. termitidis synthesized H2 and acetate at high rates on both the substrates. The concentration of H2 synthesized decreased as the pH dropped below 7.0, and then declined again as the pH dropped below 6.2. The concentration of acetate synthesis followed a similar trend and declined as the pH first dropped below 7.0 and then again as the pH dropped below 6.2. These results suggest that metabolic flux responses in C. termitidis are influenced by changes in pH. C. termiditis produces more CO2 than H2 on cellobiose, which corresponds to the maximum production of ethanol during the late log phase. On α-cellulose, the H2 production is greater than CO2, which corresponds to the increased acetate and reduced ethanol production. C. termitidis prefers producing H2 on α-cellulose irrespective of the substrate complexity (longer doubling time than on cellobiose) without shifting the carbon flow towards ethanol synthesis, where as on cellobiose, although the specific rate of H2 production is higher during log phase, the metabolism is shifted towards ethanol synthesis (Table 3 ). Where as, on α-cellulose, C. cellulolyticum has a higher doubling time of 24h [6] and produces more ethanol [5], when compared to C. termitidis and the ratio of H2 and ethanol is similar (Table 3). This characteristic feature in C. termitidis is significant and could be used for further investigation of continous culture experiments of C. termitidis on α-cellulose to stabilize the production of H2 by controlling metabolism to favor acetate rather than ethanol synthesis. The production of lactate already in mid-log phase of growth decreases the amounts of carbon available for synthesis of other end-products. The extent to which pH change and lactate synthesis affect H2 synthesis and whether these negative effects can be mitigated to increase H2 production by C. termitidis remain to be elucidated."
9,Conclusions,"We have measured H2 and CO2 synthesis and soluble end-product production (acetate, formate, lactate, and ethanol) in C. termitidis strain CT1112, cultured in 1191 medium containing 2gl−1 cellobiose and α-cellulose. Cell growth, pH patterns, organic acid and ethanol synthesis, and H2 and CO2 production were determined. We found that C. termitidis had a doubling rate of 6.5h on cellobiose compared to 18.9h on α-cellulose. In C. termitidis, H2 synthesis was greatly reduced as pH dropped below 6.2. Acetate, formate and ethanol concentrations also decreased as the pH dropped below 6.2. Reduced acetate and H2 synthesis coincided with increased CO2 and ethanol production on cellobiose. Increased H2 and acetate synthesis coincided with decreased CO2 and ethanol production on α-cellulose. Although C. termitidis had a greater doubling time on α-cellulose when compared to cellobiose, it synthesizes greater amounts of H2 than ethanol on both substrates. C. termitidis is distinct from C. cellulolyticum, which takes much longer to grow on cellulose and produces less H2 than ethanol during cellulose fermentation. The O/R ratios for C. termitidis during cellobiose and α-cellulose fermentations were 1.29 and 1.36, respectively. More work has to be done to elucidate the cellulase activities of C. termitidis, effect of substrate loading on hydrogen production and determine the presence and structural characteristics of a cellulosome."
