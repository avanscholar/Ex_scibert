0,Introduction,"Using biomass-derived molecules as green feedstocks to produce valuable chemicals is a sustainable alternative to the traditional petroleum-based routes. In particular, levulinic acid (LA) is recommended as a high value added biomass-derived molecule by the US DOE [1]. At present, LA is easily obtained through the hydrolysis of lignocellulose. LA can be further transformed into a series of important products, including γ-valerolactone (GVL), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, levulinate esters, and so on [1–4]. Among the chemicals obtained from LA, GVL has drawn considerable attention owing to its unique properties and broad applications. GVL is considered as a biodegradable and nontoxic compound, which is widely utilized as an efficient fuel additive, a safe food additive, a green solvent, or as a raw material for organic synthesis [3–6]. Various heterogeneous noble or non-noble metal catalysts have been used to catalyze the LA hydrogenation reaction for the production of GVL [3–5]. The non-noble metals seem cost-competitive, but the operating conditions are usually harsher and the catalyst amounts required are much higher [3–5]. Among the noble metal catalysts, Ru-based ones were extensively studied because of their high activity. However, Ru nanoparticles are relatively prone to aggregate during the reaction process, leading to poor metal dispersion and low metal availability [4–11]. Recently, Pd-based catalysts have also been reported to be effective for the LA hydrogenation reaction [12–15]. For example, Yan et al. developed several Pd catalysts supported on molecular sieves and SiO2, showing good catalytic activities and selectivities to GVL [12,13]. Using hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) to support Pd also exhibited satisfactory activity [14]. Pd/CeO2 was also reported as a good catalyst, which exhibited a high GVL yield up to 99.9% [15]. Although Pd is inherent active for the LA hydrogenation reaction, the application of Pd-based catalysts is still limited because of low metal dispersion, serious Pd leaching, and poor catalytic recyclability [4–6,12–15]. Therefore, more efforts should be devoted to preparing Pd-based catalysts with high dispersion and good reusability. Using a suitable new support to encapsulate and confine Pd nanoparticles in its pores is a feasible strategy to overcome the drawbacks of Pd-based catalysts as mentioned above. Unlike the conventional support materials (molecular sieves [12], silica [13,14], metal oxides [15,16], and carbon materials [17,18]), metal-organic framework (MOF) is one kind of attractive and novel porous material. MOFs are considered as promising catalyst supports [19–21], which have various superior features such as controllable pore structures, high surface areas, and modifiable functionalities [20]. The tunable cavities in MOFs provide the possibility to encapsulate and confine Pd nanoparticles, thereby promoting the metal dispersion and avoiding metal leaching. Our recent study has shown that UiO-66 is a very stable and promising MOF to encapsulate active component for the catalytic oxidation reaction [19]. UiO-66 is constructed by the coordination of Zr6 nodes with terephthalate (BDC) ligands, following the general formula of Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)6 [21]. Moreover, it is reported that UiO-66-series MOFs can catalyze the transfer hydrogenation of LA employing 2-propanol as an H-donor [22–25]. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation can avoid using high-pressure vessels. However, it is technically immature because the introduction of alcohols will result in the formation of inevitable by-products (ketones and levulinate esters), causing a number of unnecessary troubles in the product separation process [4,5]. As far as we know, no studies have been done on the hydrogenation of LA over MOFs-supported Pd catalysts up to now. The above factors inspire us to immobilize Pd nanoparticles on UiO-66 and its functionalized analogues, which can be used for the LA hydrogenation reaction. In this work, UiO-66-NH2 was used as an ideal support to encapsulate Pd particles with high metal dispersion. UiO-66-NH2 was chosen due to its good stability in water, large surface area, and hydrophilic inner cavities. In addition, –NH2 on the framework can offer effective adsorption sites for Pd(II), benefitting the dispersion and stabilization of activated Pd metal particles [26–28]. The successful encapsulation of Pd nanoparticles with fairly good dispersion was confirmed by various characterization techniques. Comparative studied were carried out to verify the importance of confinement effect and amine groups in MOF for a better catalytic performance. The developed Pd@UiO-66-NH2 catalyst was extraordinarily active, selective and durable for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation UiO-66: UiO-66 samples were prepared by a solvothermal method based on our previous work but with some modifications [19]. The solvothermal reactions of ZrCl4 with terephthalic acid were performed in an incubator under static conditions. Detailed procedures are given in the Supporting Information. UiO-66-NH 2 : Pure UiO-66-NH2 samples were prepared according to the same recipe of UiO-66, but 2-aminoterephthalic acid (BDC-NH2) was used as the organic linker instead of terephthalic acid. Pd@UiO-66-NH 2 : The encapsulation of Pd nanoparticles inside the cavities of UiO-66-NH2 was achieved via a double solvents method (Fig. 1 ). The double solvents method was developed by Xu and co-workers, and has been proved to be a very simple and effective strategy for the preparation metal@MOFs [29,30]. The detailed preparation procedure for Pd@UiO-66-NH2 is described in the Supporting Information. Pd/UiO-66-NH 2 : Pd/UiO-66-NH2 was prepared by the conventional single solvent impregnation method. For a better comparative study, the MOF support employed here was not purified by washing with DMF and methanol, so the cavities would be occupied by residual solvents. The detailed impregnation process is given in the Supporting Information. Pd@UiO-66: Pd@UiO-66 was also prepared using a double solvents method in the same way as that for Pd@UiO-66-NH2."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization MOFs and corresponding supported Pd catalysts were comprehensively characterized by a series of techniques, including XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FT-IR, TEM, HAADF-STEM, EDS, TGA, XPS, and ICP-AES. The details are shown in the Supporting Information."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction The hydrogenation of LA was conducted in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Typically, 150 mg of the Pd-based catalyst was placed into the reactor containing a LA aqueous solution (10 mL, 0.5 mol L−1). The air inside was eliminated by purging with high purity nitrogen for five times. Then, the sealed autoclave was inflated with 2 MPa of H2 and heated to 140 °C to start the reaction. The reaction products were taken at regular intervals and analyzed by a Fuli GC9790Plus gas chromatography (FID detector) using a capillary column (Rxi-5MS, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm)."
5,Recycling and hot filtration experiments,"2.4 Recycling and hot filtration experiments The reusability of the catalyst was evaluated by the recycling experiment. After the each reaction run, the catalysts were separated by filtration, washed with methanol and air-dried for 12 h before using it again. The hot filtration experiments were performed with the aim to check the potential occurrence of Pd leaching. After performing the LA hydrogenation reaction for 30 min, the catalysts were immediately removed from the hot solution by a syringe filter. The LA conversion was also recorded. The filtrate was continued to react for another 120 min under the same conditions."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization A modified double solvents method was utilized to load the palladium component into the cavities of MOF (Fig. 1). The double solvents refer to water and n-hexane, which serve as the hydrophilic and hydrophobic solvent, respectively. To be more specific, dry n-hexane with an excess volume is used for dispersing UiO-66-NH2, while water was used for dissolving H2PdCl4. The volume of water solution should be lower than the MOF pore volume. Accordingly, the hydrophile-lipophile nature will ensure that the water solution of H2PdCl4 can diffuse into the hydrophilic cavities of MOF by capillary force. Moreover, H2PdCl4 can dissociate into H+ and PdCl4 2− in the water solution, and amine groups in the MOF framework will be protonated by H+ to form UiO-66-NH3 +. This positively charged sites can provide additional electrostatic attraction for PdCl4 2− anions [28], facilitating the adsorption of Pd component. The XRD patterns of the two MOFs and the Pd@UiO-66-NH2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 2 . The diffraction patterns of the as-synthesized MOFs (curves a and b in Fig. 2) both matched well with the reported standard patterns [31,32], revealing that the crystal structure of MOFs was successfully synthesized. Pd@UiO-66-NH2 (curve c in Fig. 2) exhibited almost the same profile as that of UiO-66-NH2, suggesting that the crystallinity of the parent MOF can be primely retained throughout the catalyst synthesis process. The characteristic peaks for metallic Pd were hardly discriminated, which implies that Pd metal was highly dispersed in minute particles [32]. Hereinafter, the TEM and XPS results can prove the successful immobilization of Pd. Fig. 3 presents the TEM characterization results for Pd@UiO-66-NH2. Both the TEM and HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 3a and b) intuitively illustrate that Pd nanoparticles exist in the MOF support with fairly good dispersion. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3c) illustrates that Pd nanoparticles are dispersed on the MOF surface with clear lattice fringes. The interplanar distance is 0.224 nm, which can be assigned to the Pd (111) facet. The Pd particle sizes were ranged from 0.8 to 2.6 nm, as shown by the histogram (Fig. 3d) of the measured diameters from the TEM images. The UiO-66-NH2 cavity contains an octahedral cage (1.4 nm) and a tetrahedral cage (1.0 nm), which are joined together through triangular windows (0.6 nm) [19]. Accordingly, most of the Pd particles (<1.5 nm) can be confined in the MOF cages but cannot leak out from the windows. Because some Pd particles were closely contacted with the Zr6 nodes, parts of the sizes are slightly bigger than the cavity sizes of the MOF support [27,33]. The Pd@UiO-66-NH2 catalyst was also analyzed using STEM coupled with EDS to confirm the element distribution. As can be seen from Fig. 4 , Pd is found to exist along with Zr and N, indicating that Pd was effectively trapped by UiO-66-NH2. Ultra-small Pd nanoparticles are evenly dispersed on UiO-66-NH2 without any obvious agglomeration. In the case of Pd/UiO-66-NH2 that prepared by the conventional single solvent impregnation method, the dispersion of Pd is obviously poorer according to the TEM image from Fig. S1. The Pd nanoparticles were mainly deposited on the MOF edges with a mean particle size of 5.8 nm, which is much bigger than the cage size of the parent MOF. This indicates that a large proportion of Pd particles are on the outer surfaces of UiO-66-NH2 rather than inside the cavities [34]. Moreover, a Pd@UiO-66 catalyst was also prepared by the double solvents method for comparison. The TEM results of Pd@UiO-66 (Fig. S2) are similar to that of Pd@UiO-66-NH2 (Fig. 3), in which the Pd particles are also highly dispersed on the MOF support with a mean particle size of 1.1 nm. This further confirms that the double solvents method is a feasible technique to encapsulate and confine Pd nanoparticles in the pores of UiO-66-series MOFs. The N2 adsorption−desorption isotherms of the two MOFs and Pd@UiO-66-NH2 are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Table S1 presents the corresponding results of the textural property, and Fig. S3 shows the pore size distributions. The two MOFs exhibit a type-I shape, which is a characteristic of microporous materials. The curve of Pd@UiO-66-NH2 shows almost the same profile as the parent MOF. However, the adsorbed N2 volume decreased, which was resulted from the entry of Pd nanoparticles into the MOF cavities. Both the surface area and pore volume of Pd@UiO-66-NH2 decreased as compared to that of UiO-66-NH2, which can be attributed to the partial occupation of the MOF cavities by some Pd particles. As for UiO-66 and Pd@UiO-66, it shows a similar change on the surface areas and pore volumes. Comparatively speaking, Pd/UiO-66-NH2 owns much lower surface area and smaller pore volume. This may be due to the blockage of pores by Pd particles outside UiO-66-NH2. Comparison of the pore size distribution curves of UiO-66 (Fig. S3a) and UiO-66-NH2 (Fig. S3b) show that the amine groups in the MOF framework can produce a small number of mesopores. The loading of Pd (Fig. S3c) has no great influence on the pore size distribution of UiO-66-NH2. The FT-IR spectra of the catalyst samples are provided in Fig. 6 . The characteristic bands of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 are both well consistent with the reported works [19,35]. The peaks at 1255 and 3461 cm−1 (curve b in Fig. 6) can be assigned to the C–NH2 stretching vibration and N–H asymmetric stretching vibration respectively [36], which indicates the presence of the amine groups within the framework of UiO-66-NH2. The intensity of the two peaks become weaker after the loading Pd (curve c in Fig. 6), suggesting that there is an interaction between Pd and the –NH2 groups [35]. A peak at 1658 cm−1 is related to the CO asymmetric stretch, which originates from small amounts of the residual DMF in UiO-66-NH2 [19,37]. Interestingly, it disappears in the curve of Pd@UiO-66-NH2, which implies that the residual DMF can be thoroughly removed during the preparation process for loading of Pd by the double solvents method. As for Pd/UiO-66-NH2 (Fig. S4), the characteristic peak for DMF at 1658 cm−1 still exists strongly, implying that the cavities of UiO-66-NH2 are still mainly occupied by DMF. XPS analysis was conducted to determine the surface elements and corresponding valence states. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the peaks corresponding to Zr, N, Pd, C and O are clearly observed in the survey spectrum of Pd@UiO-66-NH2, agreeing well with the results of EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 4). Fig. 7b presents the N 1s XPS spectrum. As compared to the N 1s spectrum of pure UiO-66-NH2 [38], besides the peak for the amine groups with a binding energy at 399.3 eV, a new peak appears at 400.7 eV. This new peak can be ascribed to N in the Pd-loaded amine [39,40], suggesting that –NH2 within the MOF framework can interact with Pd, which is consistent with the FT-IR result (Fig. 6) as discussed above. In the Pd 3d spectrum (Fig. S5), one doublet with low intensity is ascribed to Pd 3d (Pd 3d5/2 = 335.9 ev, Pd 3d3/2 = 341.1 eV), verifying the existence of metallic Pd [27]. Another doublet with high intensity is attributed to the coexistence of Zr 3p signal. The loading amount of Pd obtained from ICP-AES were 0.94 wt% and 0.91 wt% for Pd@UiO-66-NH2 and Pd/UiO-66-NH2, respectively, which were close to the set value of 1 wt%. However, the Pd content was only 0.57 wt% for Pd@UiO-66 while introducing the same set value of 1 wt%. In comparison with Pd@UiO-66-NH2 and Pd/UiO-66-NH2, the significant loss of Pd element for Pd@UiO-66 indicates that the amine groups in the parent MOF are indeed beneficial to the loading of Pd. A reasonable explanation for this is that –NH2 within the framework of UiO-66-NH2 could coordinate with Pd nanoparticles to stabilize them [32]. As mentioned above, the results of FT-IR and XPS have also confirmed the existence of an interaction between Pd and the amine groups. The catalysts were also characterized by TGA, and the corresponding results will be discussed later."
8,Hydrogenation of LA,"3.2 Hydrogenation of LA The catalytic hydrogenation of LA was evaluated under batch conditions using water as a green solvent. Fig. 8 and Fig. S6 present the evolution of LA and GVL contents as a function of reaction time over the Pd-based catalysts. For all the as-prepared Pd catalysts, GVL was found as the absolutely dominant product. Only small amounts of byproducts such as 1,4-pentanediol and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran were obtained from the excessive hydrogenation after reaction for a long time. In the presence of Pd@UiO-66-NH2 (Fig. 8a), GVL concentration was rapidly reduced with an almost equivalent increase of GVL concentration within the first 60 min. It is worth noting that full conversion of LA with exclusive selectivity to GVL was achieved within 120 min. An extension of reaction time to 150 min resulted in a slight decrease in GVL concentration. On the contrary, the activity of Pd/UiO-66-NH2 was much lower (Fig. 8b). It took 270 min to accomplish the LA hydrogenation reaction with a GVL yield of 94.5%. In view of the similar Pd content for Pd@UiO-66-NH2 (0.94 wt%) and Pd/UiO-66-NH2 (0.91 wt%), the lower activity of Pd/UiO-66-NH2 is probably caused by its bigger Pd nanoparticle size and poor metal dispersion [27]. As shown in Fig. S6, Pd@UiO-66 also exhibits lower catalytic activity as compared to Pd@UiO-66-NH2. Only 79.1% of LA conversion and 78.3% of GVL yield was obtained after reaction for 120 min, and the complete conversion of LA took about 240 min. Because the Pd nanoparticles in both Pd@UiO-66 and Pd@UiO-66-NH2 are highly dispersed with almost the same size (see the results of TEM as discussed above in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2), the low loading amount of Pd (0.57 wt%) may be the reason for the lower activity of Pd@UiO-66."
9,Catalyst reusability,"3.3 Catalyst reusability The reusability of the catalyst was evaluated by reusing the corresponding catalyst for several successive reaction runs. The results of Pd@UiO-66-NH2 and Pd/UiO-66-NH2 are presented in Fig. 9 . Notably, Pd@UiO-66-NH2 exhibited excellent catalytic stability, and no significant decrease of LA conversion and GVL yield was observed even after five consecutive reaction cycles (Fig. 9a). The LA conversion and GVL yield can maintain on the verge of 100%. In contrast, Pd/UiO-66-NH2 showed an obvious and continuous deactivation, with a decrease of LA conversion from 70.7% to 46.2% just after three reaction runs (Fig. 9b). Fig. 10 presents the results of the hot filtration experiments. As can be seen from Fig. 10a, almost no further reaction was observed after removing Pd@UiO-66-NH2, implying that the LA hydrogenation reaction took place on the surface of the catalyst instead of in the solution. Furthermore, ICP-AES analysis showed that the concentration of Pd in the reaction solution was below the limit of detection, suggesting that almost no Pd leaching occurred during the reaction process. On the other hand, the reaction in the filtrate obtained from the Pd/UiO-66-NH2 catalytic system still proceeded forward with increasing LA conversion (Fig. 10b), which implies a certain amount of Pd leached from the Pd/UiO-66-NH2 catalyst into the reaction solution. In fact, the loss of Pd reached 16.8% based on the ICP-AES analysis. According to the preparation method and the characterization results as discussed above, the excellent immobilization effect for Pd in the Pd@UiO-66-NH2 catalyst can be reasonably explained by the fact that the Pd nanoparticles are encapsulated and confined inside the cavities of the parent MOF. In the case of Pd/UiO-66-NH2, no such confinement effect exists because most of the Pd nanoparticles are on the outer surfaces of the MOF support, leading to the easy occurrence of metal leaching. Similar results and explanations were also reported for other hydrogenation reactions (hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde and methylcyclopentane) using UiO-66 supported Pt catalysts [35,41]. The Pd@UiO-66-NH2 catalysts before and after the reaction cycles were characterized and compared to get more insights into the changes in the catalyst structure. Surprisingly, some textural properties of the catalyst obviously changed during the reaction cycles (Table S1), and the catalyst crystallinity also became poor (Fig. S7). These changes mainly result from the part loss of organic ligands during the reaction [24,42]. Despite the appearance of the above-mentioned changes, almost no impact on the catalytic reusability of Pd@UiO-66-NH2 was observed as shown in Fig. 9a. Similar phenomena were also found in the hydrogenation of LA over Ru-based catalysts, and it was reported that the catalyst surface area and crystallinity had little influence on the catalytic performance [8]. In addition, the FT-IR spectrum of the used Pd@UiO-66-NH2 catalyst shows slight changes in comparison with the fresh one (Fig. S8). The peaks at 1571, 1430 and 1389 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching modes of the carboxylate group coordinated with Zr4+ [35,37], are still preserved after the reaction cycles. The vibration of CC in the benzene ring with a peak at 1506 cm−1 still exists in the used catalyst sample [19,37]. There are no new characteristic bands of ZrO2 (985 and 1630 cm−1) [43] present in the used Pd@UiO-66-NH2 catalyst. Combining these FT-IR results and the XRD characterizations as discussed above, we believe that the skeleton structure of Pd@UiO-66-NH2 can be basically retained during the catalyst recycling experiment despite the part loss of organic ligands. The number of the lost 2-aminoterephthalic acid (BDC-NH2) linkers can be estimated by the TGA data. As presented in Fig. 11 , the TGA curves of the fresh and used catalysts show a similar variation trend with different profiles. Pd@UiO-66-NH2 is thermally stable below 280 °C, under which the weight loss is attributed to the release of physisorbed water, residual solvent and the dehydration of Zr6O4(OH)4 nodes to Zr6O6 [24,31]. According to the well-established missing linker defects studies, the MOF formula after the dehydration is Zr6O6+x (BDC-NH2)6-x , where x represents the missing number of organic linkers [42,44]. The weight loss of the used catalyst was less than 18.7% as compared with the fresh catalyst, corresponding to two missing BDC-NH2 linkers (x = 2 as calculated). Therefore, two BDC-NH2 linkers are lost after the reaction cycles. Previous investigations have also reported that the skeleton structure of UiO-66 can be well maintained with two missing linkers per Zr6 node unit [44,45]. Taken together, Pd@UiO-66-NH2 is a promising catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of LA to GVL. It showed excellent catalytic reusability without any significant decrease of LA conversion and GVL yield during the catalyst recycling experiment, though two BDC-NH2 linkers lost from the framework of UiO-66-NH2. The skeleton structure of UiO-66-NH2 can be stabilized by its unique ability of structural rearrangement because of the high connectivity of zirconium in the framework [22]. After the rearrangement, a stable MOF with two missing linker defects were obtained. The formula of UiO-66-NH2 may change from Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC-NH2)6 to Zr6O6(OH)4(BDC-NH2)4."
10,Catalytic performance comparison,"3.4 Catalytic performance comparison Table 1 lists a comparison of the catalytic performance between Pd@UiO-66-NH2 and other heterogeneous Pd-based catalysts reported in the literature. The GVL yields presented in Table 1 are the best results selected from the corresponding literature. The catalytic performance can be reasonably compared by the productivity of GVL [6]. Encouragingly, the as-prepared Pd@UiO-66-NH2 catalyst in the present work exhibits the highest GVL productivity (1741.1 mmol g−1h−1) as compared with the state-of-the-art heterogeneous Pd catalysts. Although a comparatively higher GVL productivity at 1385.1 mmol g−1h−1 was obtained over Pd/SiO2, the reaction conditions were much harsher. Therefore, Pd@UiO-66-NH2 is an extraordinarily efficient catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of LA to GVL."
11,Reaction mechanism,"3.5 Reaction mechanism As has been discussed, the hydrogenation of LA to GVL over Pd@UiO-66-NH2 is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. Under heterogeneous catalytic conditions, there are two leading possible mechanisms for the production of GVL from LA, including the hydrogenation–dehydration pathway and the dehydration–hydrogenation pathway [46,47]. The former involves the hydrogenation of the ketone group in LA to form a 4-hydroxypentanoic acid intermediate, followed by dehydration (intramolecular esterification) to GVL. The latter is based on the endothermic dehydration of LA to angelicalactone and subsequent hydrogenation to form GVL. Accordingly, both the hydrogenation active sites and dehydration active sites are necessary for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. As far as Pd@UiO-66-NH2 is concerned, the hydrogenation step can occur on the Pd metal sites, while the dehydration step can take place on the acid sites. The acid sites originate from the Zr6 nodes in the framework of UiO-66-NH2. UiO-66-series MOFs possess uncoordinated zirconium sites, which can serve as Lewis acid sites [5,32]. Meanwhile, the missing linker defects in the framework can bond with H2O and –OH groups to compensate the charge loss, generating Brønsted acid sites (μ3-OH, –OH2 and –OH protons) on the Zr6 nodes [48]. It is well known that both the Lewis and Brønsted acid sites can catalyze the dehydration reaction, especially for the esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols [49,50]. The angelicalactone-mediated dehydration–hydrogenation pathway requires relatively higher reaction temperatures, and it is usually reasonable in an inert atmosphere [46,47]. In this work, the hydrogenation of LA was performed at a lower temperature (140 °C) and in the presence of molecular hydrogen. Therefore, the more plausible reaction pathway is the hydrogenation–dehydration one. Based on the discussions above, a possible reaction mechanism has been proposed for the production of GVL from the hydrogenation of LA over Pd@UiO-66-NH2. As shown in Fig. 12 , the octahedral framework of UiO-66-NH2 is simplified for clarity. Initially, hydrogen is dissociated and adsorbed on the Pd surface, which is accompanied by the adsorption of LA on the Zr node with acid sites (step 1). Next, the ketone group in LA undergoes hydrogenation by the activated hydride species to form adsorbed 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (step 2). Subsequently, GVL can be formed via the acid-catalyzed dehydration (intramolecular esterification) of 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (step 3). Finally, the adsorbed GVL is released to regenerate the active sites, and a catalytic cycle is completed (step 4)."
12,Conclusions,"The encapsulation of highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles inside the cavities of UiO-66-NH2 was successfully achieved using a simple double solvents method. The confinement effect and an interaction between Pd and the amine groups enable Pd@UiO-66-NH2 to show an excellent immobilization effect for Pd. The as-prepared Pd@UiO-66-NH2 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL under mild conditions. Full conversion of LA with exclusive selectivity to GVL was achieved within 2 h. The skeleton structure of Pd@UiO-66-NH2 can be maintained during the catalyst recycling experiment despite the loss of two organic linkers after five consecutive reaction cycles. The hydrogenation of LA to GVL over Pd@UiO-66-NH2 is proposed to follow the hydrogenation–dehydration pathway, involving 4-hydroxypentanoic acid as an intermediate. As compared with other reported Pd-based catalysts, Pd@UiO-66-NH2 shows the highest GVL productivity. The results obtained in this study may provide a useful reference to the utilization of MOFs in biomass conversion."
