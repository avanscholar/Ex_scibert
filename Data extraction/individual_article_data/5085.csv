0,Introduction,"RCCI strategy in the low-temperature combustion in internal combustion (IC) engines among two other methods i.e. HCCI (homogenous charge compression ignition) and PCCI (premixed compression combustion ignition) has better thermal efficiency while decreasing engine pollutant emissions [13]. In all these three strategies fuel mixture is a lean type that limits operational conditions of the engines, especially when there is a low reactivity fuel (LRF) like natural gas in the mixture [4,5]. Because of these limited operational conditions and the nature of ignition type, there are various options to have direct control on in-cylinder combustion in this strategy [6]. Researchers have been performed investigation on operational conditions of RCCI engines such as pre-heating of intake air, variable compression ratio, use of exhaust gas recirculation and glow plug as well as injecting pilot fuel [79]. To have a more homogenous mixture of fuel and more stable combustion in IC engines especially for low temperature combustion (LTC) regimes, a pre-chamber can be suggested [10]. Pre-chamber also provides more benefits such as smooth working of the engine because of combustion starting from pre-chamber [10–13]. There has also been some work in using pre-chamber in RCCI engines where (high reactivity fuel) HRF would be injected into the pre-chamber in the rest of fuel mixture [1416]. Because RCCI uses two fuels with different reactivity, the study of using various fuels in this type of engines has been attractive for researchers. Natural gas (NG)/diesel RCCI engine with the pre-chamber was investigated by Salahi et al. [14,15]. They investigated effects of using pre-chamber on combustion and emission of an RCCI engine. Kakoee et al. [16] investigated the effects of hydrogen addition on combustion characteristics of a NG/Diesel RCCI engine with pre-chamber. They have obtained that adding hydrogen on the mixture can reduce emissions beside better performance [16]. Liu et al. [17] have used hydrogen in a mixture of NG/DME for investigating the effect of Cetane number on combustion characteristics. Their results showed that there is a decrease in the amount of UHC and CO and increase in NO because of higher in-cylinder temperature. Olsen et al. [18] focused on changing the low reactivity fuels; they used different concentrations of natural gas in an experimental model of RCCI engines. They showed that using more natural gas fraction results in more UHC and CO with decreasing NO as pollutants. Bio-diesel has also been used as an alternative high reactivity fuel in a NG/biodiesel RCCI engine by Gharehghani et al. [19]. The main purpose in their research was about effects of HRF Cetane number effects on engine performance and emissions where there are similar results in increasing Cetane number of fuel mixture. In order to using different fuels Han W. et al. [20] have been investigated different start of injection, total energy and inlet pressure on a gasoline/diesel RCCI engine at 2018. An n-heptane/gasoline engine has been used by Zhu L. et al. in 2015 to investigate some initial conditions such as injection timing and ratio of two LRF and HRF on combustion and emission characteristics [21]. Pan S. et al., 2017, was done an experimental research on a 2-butanol/diesel multi-cylinder RCCI engine emissions and characteristics [22]. M. Mohebi also use a n-butanol/diesel RCCI engine for their investigation about engine performance and emissions, they used different percentages of fuels in the mixture, their investigation shows lower efficiency for increasing n-butanol fraction [23]. There are also some other strategies to control emission from RCCI engines, in 2018 Santiago Molina et al. [24] used a Miler cycle applied on an RCCI engine to control combustion and emission, they obtained better condition for emissions and also fuel consumption. Investigation on RCCI is not limited to fuels and their properties. Heat transfer approach to RCCI is also attractive for investigators, recently M. Nazarian et al. investigated the effects of bowl geometry and injection timing on an RCCI engine to improving waste heat during combustion process [25]. in RCCI heat transfer investigations there is an experimental research [26] that compare an RCCI engine heat transfer with a conventional one that shows RCCI engine has higher bulk temperature. Bowl geometry also has been investigated in A. Kakaee et al. research in 2016 [27] where their investigations show that in low load, geometry is not effective but in higher load there are some enhancement in reducing emissions specially for UHC. To attain a LTC there are also some investigation on using two different fuel with different injection strategy in Soloiu V. et al. investigation in 2013 in an n-butanol/biodiesel RCCI engine [28]. Recently in 2018, Ali Turkcan et al. was investigated LTC engine with alcohol and gasoline as high and low reactivity fuels, they investigated effects of second injection timing of an HCCI combustion and emission characteristics [29]. Dimethyl ether is a liquefied gas that can produce from different ways such as natural gas, crude oil, waste products and biomasses. Its characteristics are similar to the liquefied petroleum gas[LPG] with high reactivity makes it very attractive to be used in IC engines [30,38]. There are different investigations on using DME as the fuel in compression ignition engines, spark ignition and rotary application which is performed by Arcoumaniset al. [31]. As it was discussed using some additive on the fuel mixture can improve engine performance beside reduce pollution, hydrogen as an available source of additive that have acceptable results in reduce pollutant, in this work, effects of using hydrogen from port fuel on the combustion performance and characteristics of an RCCI natural gas/dimethyl-ether engine as well as on the exhaust emissions, has been investigated. Hydrogen percentages was considered as percentages of LRF heating values in the mixture. Six various percentages of hydrogen were investigated in this research, zero, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% of hydrogen. In addition, according to DME decomposition process investigating on emissions of this type of HRF was considered as main subjects in this research. In all case studies amount of input HV keep constant and is 275 (KJ) with same mass input. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of engine in AVL fire software coupled with the Chemkin solver is used to investigate the combustion and emission of this model. The numerical model is validated with a one cylinder E6/MS Ricardo engine that is equipped with a CommetMK.V pre-chamber. A mechanism of reactions and species transport was developed which contains DME decomposing reactions that shows DME in-cylinder breaking up behavior."
1,Numerical model,"Computational grids, solver setting and tools and methods will be explained in this section beside validation of numerical model and error analysis and uncertainty."
2,"Computational model, tools and methods","2.1 Computational model, tools and methods A Ricardo E6/MS one-cylinder research engine equipped with a Commet MK.V pre-chamber was used as an experimental setup in this research. it was also developed a numerical model which has the same geometry and properties as the engine. Compression ratio is 17.2 and the ratio of pre-chamber volume to total volume is about 0.54; other properties of the engine are shown in Table 1 . A numerical 3D model has been created (Fig. 1 ). As shown in Fig. 1 a close cycle modeling was used in this investigation that is from IVC to EVO of the engine. Combustion and emission of the modeled engine were investigated with AVL fire CFD software coupled with Chemkin solver (AVL-Chemkin). Average equations of conservation mass, momentum, and energy (enthalpy), as well as species, have been solved in the entire mixture to perform the modeling. Turbulence modeling is also performed by using two standard k − ε model equations. Modeling of the atomization of fuel spray droplets was done with the Kelvin-Helmholtz model in conjunction with the Riley-Taylor model(KH-RT). It is necessary to explain that the KH model is based on the wave model, and in fact, is used to predict the first break-up of droplets, and the RT model is examined along with the KH model for predicting the future breakup of the droplets [32]. A high temperature of in-cylinder may cause some effects on the fuel droplets and their evaporation. Thus, it is necessary to consider the effect of temperature on evaporation. To do so Dockowich model was used. In this model, it is assumed that the evaporation of droplets occurs in a two-phase environment with non-condensable gas and vapor [33,34]. Heat transfer between chamber and pre-chamber contents with walls influence on combustion quality and also thermodynamic properties [35], according to this phenomenon different effective factors were modeled, flow turbulence, wall heat transfer, gas density change. Heat transfer between wall and turbulent flow modeled with considering density and Prandtl number in each step of solving [35]. Due to the nature of combustion in RCCI engines, it can be controlled by chemical phenomenon; so, it is important to use special conditions in CFD modeling to find acceptable solution and modeling. In order to perform this modeling, it is necessary to provide appropriate data into the solver to achieve an acceptable model for combustion and also exhaust emissions. Therefore, AVL fire calculates the temperature and pressure in each step for computational grid and feeds them to the Chemkin solver. Chemkin solver will then calculate the rate of consumption and production of species based on the data provided by AVL fire [39]. It was assumed that the mixture of fuels has been distributed in all area of the combustion chamber (pre-chamber and main chamber) and DME is injected to pre-chamber from 6 holes’ injector (the specification of this injector was shown in Table 2 ). Location of the injector is on the top center of the pre-chamber. Initial condition for modeling turbulence and also mesh properties of modeled geometry were listed in Table 3 ."
3,Computational grid,"2.2 Computational grid Due to the type of modeling, a moving computational grid is needed. Fame engine plus modules of AVL-fire has been used to create a moving mesh from IVC to EVO as a close cycle modeling. According to the symmetry of geometry, a computational grid was applied to half of the model and as a result, time computing becomes lower with this grid beside high precision results. To have more accurate results, it is necessary to create more fine meshes in the pre-chamber because of SOC (start of combustion) in this area and in throat between pre-chamber and main chamber due to the concentration of the flow and its spices. Figure shows the computational grid for the modeled geometry at TDC; totally, there are 180118 cells in computational grid at BDC and 75493 cells in TDC section of the piston in the modeled geometry, meshed geometry was shown in Fig. 2 various size of meshes according to the regions is abvious in this figure. Table 4 shows the geometry specification for in-cylinder computational model."
4,SolverSetting,"2.3 SolverSetting We used a standard k-ε model to perform turbulence modeling. All settings for this model has been performed using AVL fire solver setting [39]. The speed of the engine was adjusted on 800 RPM which is in low load condition. In the experimental setup the temperature of the cooling water is about 410 K and the temperature of the cylinder wall was assumed to be equal to the coolant temperature; the temperature of the piston surface and the cylinder head were assumed to be 500 K. In this study, it is assumed that CH4 and CH3OCH3 are chemical formulas of NG and DME, respectively as two fuels of the RCCI engine. In the solving process of the numerical model, because of the presence of the chemical reaction and the production of in-cylinder reactions it is required to have a set of reactions and spices transport related to DME and NG. In Ref. [17], Jie Liu et al. used a reaction and spices transport set of 350 reactions and 73 spices for numerical modeling combustion in an RCCI engine. To use appropriate species transport and reactions of DME, NG, and H2 in, for example, cool diffusion flame, a set of 893 reactions and 130 species were used by C. B. Reuter et al. in Refs. [36,37]. In this work a mechanism of 134 spices and 350 chemical reactions has been used that includes NOx formation reaction, for the hydrogen add-on, this mechanism is also used because hydrogen-related reactions are present in this mechanism and only in the initial values it is necessary to determine its concentration of it. The base of species transport and reactions are NG reactions and species transport, GRI 3.0, where some heavy hydrocarbons such as DME reactions and species have been added; this mechanism also consists of emission production of NOx and H2 reactions. In all case studies, the inlet energy of the fuel keeps constant. Adding hydrogen is in the way of adding a percentage of heating value (HV) in the HVof low reactivity fuel; in each case, addition of the hydrogen HV causes picking the rest of LRF HV from CH4 heating value. Heating value of all fuel mixtures kept constant and is 275 (KJ)."
5,Validation of the numerical model,"2.4 Validation of the numerical model To perform a good validation, Ricardo engine with the specification shown in Table 1 was used in the experimental setup. Natural gas as a low reactivity fuel (LRF) enters the main chamber from the air intake manifold. The injection time of both LRF and HRF into intake manifold is adjustable. To have more homogenous fuel before ignition, HRF is injected to pre-chamber at 45° before TDC. This degree of crack provides a sufficient time to create enough homogenous fuel in the cylinder. In this model, pre-chamber causes more turbulence in the mixture of the fuel and as a result, more mixed fuel will be provided. Power of the engine has been measured with a 22 kW and 420-V dynamometer which is mounted at the engine power output. A piezo-electric QC43D-AVL determined the in-cylinder pressure during the data collection and validation of the numerical model with less than 0.1 CAD error. During this experiment the engine speed was kept constant at a low load condition of 800 rpm. Equivalence ratio of natural gas and DME is 0.3. Temperature and pressure at IVC are 385 K and 1.2 bar, respectively, which are initial conditions of numerical model. A magnetic rotary encoder (MES-2500D-T, Fotek) with a resolution of 2500ppr was used to determine the crankshaft angle; this encoder was mounted on crankshaft. To have a specific intake temperature and pressure, a heater and turbocharger were used to adjust the intake temperature and pressure. LRF pressure at the time of entry to the intake manifold is 2 bar. This pressure is due to storing DME into a constant pressure reservoir. The mass flow of DME is measured by a YAMTAKE flow meter and the AFR (air to fuel ratio) of the engine is measured by a λ sensor mounted on the exhaust manifold. Gas temperature is measured using a k-type thermocouple with less than 1% of error. Consumption of HRF is measured by the AVL-735 mass flow meter which is also compatible with the fuel temperature. Fig. 3 illustrates the schematic of the experimental setup. HRF, DME in this research was injected from fuel tank and LRF (NG) was injected into the port fuel from upper injector in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between experimental pressure and HRR with those of numerical model. As can be seen in this figure, there are good accuracy and trend in HRR of numerical and experimental data which there are same start of combustion (SOC), BD (Burn Duration) and pick of heat release. Pressure also as a specific factor of engine also have acceptable accuracy in the investigated experimental and numerical cases. In brief Table 5 shows operational conditions of studied engine. An AVL DiGas 400 gas analyzer is used to measure amount and type of emissions from the engine. It can quantify CO, NO, HC, CO2, and O2. Table 6 shows exhaust emission from both numerical modeling and experimental setup; as it is shown in this table amounts of exhaust emissions in both data types are in same order that can admit accuracy of numerical data. In experimental data collection, there are about 459 measured points in about 200 cycle of engine for IMEP and HRR data collection process. in this way maximum standard deviation (STD) and minimum of it tabulated in Table 7 ."
6,Error analysis and uncertainty,"2.5 Error analysis and uncertainty Possible errors in the experimental measurement process include errors related to the operator (human) and devices, errors related to the nonlinear operation of the devices, as well as the error associated with the calibration of them. Given these errors, the measurements obtained from the experiments cannot be considered as complete and accurate. For this purpose, certain statistical and mathematical methods are used to minimize these errors. The general method is to use repeated measurements and determine the minimum error rate for obtaining desired results, the following three methods of estimating error are considered with this system: A) Estimation of the primary parameters error: The first group of parameters that are measured directly, are the pressure, temperature, mass flow of air, fuel mass flow and also the species in the exhaust gases. These errors are those that are related to measuring tools where explained in validation section of this article, according to this device s each test contains an error for this problem the repeat testing strategy has been used with internal error analysis for them. This strategy causes to obtain a mean output of each measured property. B) Secondary parameters those obtain from primary parameters like; lambda, specific emissions were corrected with using external error analysis, in this case a certain test data collection obtained from primary error estimation to calculate secondary parameters. C) Cyclic variation causes to produce some errors in some specific measured parameters, for example; IMEP. Minimizing the error of these type of parameters has been done with repeat measurement of each parameters. For this case measuring was repeated 200 time at a point. Average of parameter was used during engine study. In this stage measured of uncertainty of calculated results were shown in Table 8 ."
7,Results and discussion,"Results of studied cases were described in this section which have been separated in different sections. Combustion, emissions and thermodynamic properties are three aspects of obtained results those explained in five sections; energy conversion process, engine performance, combustion process, engine emissions and thermodynamic properties."
8,Energy conversion process,"3.1 Energy conversion process According to initial conditions, especially for start of ignition (SOI) which is −45 CAD aTDC, DME is injected into pre-chamber at 664 K which is a temperature that can provide thermal reactivity energy for DME breaking up to CH4, CO and H2 [40]. Comparing DME combustion and decomposition shows that breaking up process is more earlier than combustion which is occurred at in-cylinder temperature approximately near 1000 K, beside this decomposing process occurs at different temperature and pressure with different speed of breaking up. Equation (1) shows DME decomposition, according to this equation each mole of DME breaks up to 1 mol of CH4, H2 and CO2. Speed of decomposing of DME is related to temperature [40], for example chemical kinetic modeling of DME shows 99% of DME is broken up in about 0.1 s at 973 K [40], this process is faster in higher pressure also, if it was assumed that speed of decomposing of DME is 99% per 0.1 s at SOI and at near combustion this speed assumed about 99% per 0.03 s [40], so the speed of decomposition of DME from SOI to CAD before SOC assumed about 99% per 0.05 s, time between SOI and SOC calculated from engine speed and is about 0.0046 s. With these assumptions and knowing delay time from SOI to SOC it was obtained that 10% of DME approximately decomposed to its products, CH4, CO2 and H2before combustion start. (1) C H 3 O C H 3 → C H 4 + H 2 + C O Cetane number of mixture of fuels where calculated from equation (2), [41]. (2) C N m i x = ( F A R s t , H R F φ H R F C N H R F + F A R s t , L R F φ L R F C N L R F ) ( F A R s t , H R F C N H R F + F A R s t , L R F C N L R F ) F A R represent fuel-air-ratio, C N is Cetan number, s t designated stoichiometric, φ H R F and φ L R F are charge equivalence ratio of bot fuels which were calculated from equation (3), [41]. (3) φ x = ( m x m a i r ) ( m x m a i r ) s t In this equation, m x represent mass of each fuel in the mixture of modeled RCCI engine. Inserting equation (3) into equation (2) and with assuming that A = ( F A R s t , H R F C N H R F + F A R s t , L R F C N L R F ) : (4) C N m i x = 1 m a i r . A ( m H R F . C N H R F + m L R F . C N L R F ) according to this equation and Cetane number of fuels those tabulated in Table 9 , changing on each fuel Cetane number effects directly on mixture Cetane number, as described above where 10% of DME decomposed to methane, CO2 and hydrogen Cetane number of fuels descended 10% before SOC that can influence on engine performance and emissions. In fact apart of input heating value consumed for DME decomposing and as a results cause to lower combustion quality that is effective on combustion and emission characteristics of engine which will be discussed in next sections. Fig. 8 shows release CH4 as UHC near SOC."
9,Engine performance,"3.2 Engine performance For comparing engine efficiency of using various percentage of hydrogen, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) is used. Equation 5shows gross work relation to IMEP. As it is illustrated in Fig. 5, higher percentage ofH2produces more power. IMEP that was calculated from equation (2) is 3.31 bar for zero percentage of H2 that is 19.7% less than that of with 50% of H2 addition which is3.97 bar. Using fuel mixture with higher H2amountresults in releasing more heat during BD. This increase in the cumulative heat release is about 16% for the maximum amount of H2 (50%), as shown in Table 10 . In fact, adding hydrogen in the fuel mixture cause to higher quality combustion due to hydrogen flame speed, this properties of hydrogen can make some changes in combustion such as properties those discussed in this section. It can be concluded from Fig. 5 and Table 10 that the trend of increasing IMEP and CHR is decreasing, in other words CHR increase from zero to 10% of H2 is more than from 40 to 50% of it, It is due to reaching the amount of hydrogen to the saturation point of it that cause to descend in potential reactivity between hydrogen and mixture of fuel. Adding hydrogen from manifold cause to reduce volumetric efficiency of air and results to decrease trend of IMEP ascend also. It is also clear from Table 10 that the trend of increasing CHR drops during adding hydrogen that is about 8% in the first stage of adding H2, from 0% to 10% but drops to about 0.4% in the last section of adding H2 from 40 to 50%. This trend is also the same for increasing IMEP. Fig. 6 shows heat release rate for various amount of H2. As it is clear from this figure, SOC was advanced in higher percentage of using hydrogen HV. There is also a peak after high-temperature heat release(HTHR) which is because of the flame spreading from pre-chamber to the main chamber."
10,Combustion process,"3.3 Combustion process Investigation of the combustion process has been done considering BD, CA50, SOC, and EOC. It was assumed that burn duration (BD) is from combustion start to where 90% of heat released (CA90) and CA50 is a point that 50% of heat released. Using hydrogen as an additive in this RCCI engine advanced SOC from 1 CAD aTDC in 0% to −4 CAD aTDC of using 50% H2, as it can be seen in Table 11 . Table 11 shows tabulated combustion characteristics, which are SOC, EOC, BD, and CA50. There is an advancement in SOC with adding more H2, advancing in SOC is due to higher flammability of hydrogen, because of the increase inflame propagation speed in higher percentage of H2; BD was decreased from 9 CAD in zero percent to 3CAD at 50% of adding H2. Fig. 7 illustrated combustion characteristics in various percentages of hydrogen, as it is clear from this figure BD in lower percentages of hydrogen is higher, advancing in SOC and CA50 in the direction of adding hydrogen shows that the effect of hydrogen addition."
11,Engine emissions,"3.4 Engine emissions As it was mentioned before, one of main goals of using LTC strategy is to control engine emissions such as CO, NOx, and UHC. In this research, adding H2 in the fuel mixture lead to reducing as one of the main emissions. Fig. 8 shows CO in-cylinder production in gr/kWh, hydrogen addition into the LRF cause to decrease the amounts of CO at EVO, from this figure CO ascend from 0% to 10% case study is because of higher input mass at next levels, the inlet mass (air + fuel) in zero case is about 53 gr and at other levels is 59 gr, Table 11 shows exhausted CO at EVO in gr/kWh. In CO mass production diagram second pick of CO release is due to spreading combustion from pre-chamber to the main chamber. Conditions for UHC is also same as CO mass release, hydrogen decreases UHC release during combustion, Fig. 8, Table 12 also illustrate EVO UHC mass release in gr/kWh. An increase at near SOC for UHC is because of DME decomposition reaction that produces CH4, Co and H2which are main products of DME decomposition reaction [40]. Contour concentration of CO in EVO was shown in Fig. 10 . According to this figure, and also as a result of Fig. 8, the amount of this emission has been reduced during the process of adding H2 in the fuel mixture. As it was discussed in previous section trend decreasing due to descend in potential reactivity between hydrogen and rest of fuel or in other words percentage of hydrogen goes to saturation point. The comparison between in-cylinder COs at EVO shows 80% decrease in mass of these species, from 0 to 50% of additive H2. This fall is about 90% for UHC that was shown in Fig. 10, and the diagram in Fig. 8. Fig. 10 also shows NO mass fraction in different hydrogen concentrations which shows an increasing trend in the amount of this type of emissions at EVO, this increase is about 95% from 0% to 50% of additiveH2 in the fuel mixture. Increasing of NO for 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of H2 are 62%,75%,85%, and 93.5%, respectively. Increasing in-cylinder temperature during combustion cause to release more NO, temperature increase is about 19.1% in using 50% hydrogen in the mixture of LRF; this high temperature also causes a better combustion of CH4and reduces CO and UHC emissions. Fig. 9 shows diagrams of in-cylinder NO production for different case studies in gr/kWh. In this figure the increasing of NO emission is clear. Also NO ascend is high in higher percentages of H2 in this research but this increase is in an acceptable range of NO production where NO released for maximum percentages of hydrogen is near Euro 6 standards and in other cases NO mass in gr/kWh are below this standard. In the case of NO emission investigation trend of increasing of this emission is ascending or in the other words NO jumping from 0 to 10% H2 is lower than from 40 to 50% of hydrogen. Mass release of NO also was tabulated in Table 12 . Decreasing trend and the range of released emission measured at EVO were illustrated in Table 12, according to the emission limits in euro six and euro five increasing hydrogen in these study cases results to reaching acceptable standards up to about 34% of hydrogen addition. In this point all emissions are in euro six standards for diesel engine. Fig. 10 shows produced mass fraction of NO as contours, increasing of NO in higher percentages of hydrogen is clear in this figure where in 50% case there is approximately zero mass fraction of it."
12,Thermodynamic properties,"3.5 Thermodynamic properties In-cylinder thermodynamic properties of combustion phenomenon are shown in Fig. 11 . According to this figure there is an increase of temperature from 1555 K to 1809 K in 0% and 50% of additiveH2, respectively. This is because of high heating value, flammability and flame speed of Hydrogen that causes to increase temperature during combustion phenomenon. During H2 addition, there is also an increase in pressure which is shown in Fig. 11. This increase is about 20% from 63 bar in using 0% H2 to 83.5 bar at 50% H2. Also, advancing SOC is clear in the pressure and temperature diagram. Table 13 shows changing in temperature and pressure for different amount of additive H2. The trend of changing in this table is also clear for in-cylinder temperature and pressure as thermodynamic properties. In-cylinder pressure at near TDC is shown in Fig. 12 . As shown in this figure, adding hydrogen in the fuel mixture increases pressure pick and advances this pick point about 4.5CAD in the case of 50% hydrogen HV addition. CAD's were selected due to the maximum and minimum pressure of CAD occurrences in the cylinder which are from −2 aTDC CAD to 7aTDC CAD. Advancement in SOC due to adding hydrogen can be concluded from Fig. 12, higher pressure in contours in higher amounts of hydrogen in same CAD shows this advancement."
13,Conclusion,"RCCI as one of the LTC strategies is used to reduce engine emissions while providing a relatively high performance. Using two different fuels in this strategy prepares a way to have more control on LTC strategies. Having a lean mixture in this type of engines provide a low in-cylinder temperature. High reactivity fuel, DME in this investigation, and low reactivity fuel, CH4, can affect the engine characteristics. using different fuels with various CN is a way to regulate the combustion of this type of engine. Changing heating values of the fuel mixture can be done using some additives like hydrogen. In this research Cetane number of fuel is changed with adding 10, 20,30,40 and 50% of hydrogen. In all five cases the total entrance of HV is constant. Main results of this study could be summarized as follow: a) Investigation on input heating value converting process on DME illustrated that according to decomposition speed of DME to methane, hydrogen and CO2 there is enough time from SOI to SOC to break up more than 10% of DME to its decomposition products that cause reduce initial Cetane number and also heating value. Also DME has higher Cetane number but with these changes in mixture properties before combustion, led to lower combustion quality, higher emissions and lower out-put power in comparison with diesel cases. b) Performance of the engine during addition of hydrogen was investigated using IMEP according to its relation to the gross work. There was an increase of 19.7% in IMEP in adding 50% HV of hydrogen in LRF. CHR is also increased about 16% c) Combustion characteristics such as SOC, CA50, EOC, and BD: results showed combustion advance and lower BD during entrance of hydrogen into LRF. SOC was advanced from 1 to −4 CAD aTDC, these numbers are 6 and -1.8 for CA50 advance. BD decreased about 6 CAD which is because of high flammability of hydrogen cause to a faster in-cylinder combustion. d) High heating value, flame speed and flammability of hydrogen lead to increasing in-cylinder temperature and pressure. The temperature increased from 1455 K to 1800 K which is about 345 K. Rise in the pressure is about 20 bar with having 50% of additive hydrogen HV in LRF. e) UHC, CO and NO were used to investigate engine emissions. Due to the temperature increase of in-cylinder combustion, there is high-quality burning of CH4 and as a result, there is a descent of UHC at EVO about 90% in %50 hydrogen adding. This fall is about 80% for CO. Because of increasing in-cylinder temperature NO emission rises during adding hydrogen into fuel mixture. In the case of 50% of additive hydrogen there is about 95% of NO production increase. According to these results, adding hydrogen into CNG/DME RCCI engine can reduce UHC and CO, also risen of NO, NO ascend is more than 90% but it is in the acceptable range and below euro 6 standards in first five cases and near of this standard for 50% of H2 addition.; the temperature and ER in these case studies are in acceptable range. CH4 releases was observed near SOC due to DME decomposing process, this phenomenon also shows importance of SOI specially for DME which produce UHC in this process. According to all emissions it seems that using 34% of hydrogen in LRF HV (0.126 gr in air/fuel mixture) keeps all emissions in the range of euro six standard."
