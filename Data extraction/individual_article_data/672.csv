0,Introduction,"The majority of chemicals arising from raw biomass transformations are (poly)oxygenated compounds such as alcohols, polyols, sugars and carboxylic acids [1]. The overwhelming abundance of hydroxyl group in the bio-based chemicals designates the alcohol function as a key in the production of higher-value chemicals from bio-based feedstock. Bio-based primary alcohols are actually used as biofuels as well as platform molecules in the production of higher-added value chemicals. For example, 1-butanol is considered as an advanced biofuel and bioethanol, for which worldwide production has reached 93billion litres in 2014, currently accounts almost 90% of the global biofuel production [2,3]. These alcohols have been identified as platform molecules to give industrial access to hydrogen, hydrocarbons, heavier alcohols and oxygenated derivatives [4]. In this context, a reaction such as primary alcohol acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) has gained interest as an environmentally friendly, atom-efficient catalytic process producing simultaneously esters and hydrogen [5]. Depending on the reaction conditions and the substrates nature, this reaction’s scope is not limited to the production of symmetric esters from primary alcohols homocoupling: it can be extended to mixed primary-secondary esters, lactones and polyesters, for instance (Scheme 1 ) [6–8]. Catalytic systems involving conventional (“innocent”) ligands, i.e., ligands that are not involved in the alcohol activation, typically require high reaction temperatures (about 180°C) and few examples were reported [9]. On the other hand, Shvo’s pioneering work demonstrated that cyclopentadienone-based ruthenium complexes are capable of catalysing the ADC of benzyl alcohol to the corresponding ester in the presence of 2mol% ruthenium catalyst loading and at comparatively milder temperature (145°C). This is enabled by the use of ligand-metal bifunctional catalyst, wherein the redox activity is combined between the metal center and a cyclopentadienone ligand (Scheme 2 ) [10]. Further on, building on this metal-ligand cooperativity (MLC) concept, Milstein et al. achieved multiple, major breakthroughs using specific metal/non-innocent ligand combinations that involve the nowadays well-established aromatization/dearomatization process of pyridine-based pincer complexes (Scheme 2), which is applied to promote the ADC of alcohols, among other transformations [11]. Remarkably, such systems yield high selectivity under mild conditions (0.1 [Ru] mol% loading, 115°C). Following Milstein’s initial reports [12], several other related complexes were further developed and have found numerous applications [13]. Iron, ruthenium and osmium complexes supported by pincer ligands bearing a central secondary amino function (PNP [14], PNN [15] or SNS [16]) have been introduced, mostly by Beller and Gusev. These rely on the MLC concept involving an amido-amino couple (Scheme 2) [17]. Similarly, cooperative catalytic systems involving alkoxy-alcohol pairs developed by Gelman (Scheme 2) were also studied. They however require longer reaction times (36h) to reach satisfactory yields [18]. Among these examples, the PNP systems have attracted a specific interest. The remarkable catalytic performances and fair ease of access to such catalysts has blossomed into their application in organic synthesis [19–23] and potentially in industrial processes [19b]. Several examples of such complexes and corresponding ligands are commercially available from major suppliers. Most frequently, the hydrido chloride precursors, more stable than the catalytically-involved dihydride counterparts, are employed in combination with a large excess of base as a catalyst activator [14a,15,16]. One of the main drawbacks of the use of such additives is the generation of additional base-induced side-products, which implies the need for further additional purification efforts prior to isolation of the targeted product. Thus, development of efficient and robust base-free catalytic systems is a matter of concern when considering future developments in the use of such catalytic systems at larger scales. To date, only a few examples describing the base-free ADC reaction were reported (Fig. 1 ). Milstein complexes and related PNN systems are active using typically catalyst loadings ranging from 0.1 to 1mol% [12,24]. Examples of the use of osmium and ruthenium hydrides catalysts supported by a aliphatic PNP pincer ligand to prepare the esters are scarce, and mixed results regarding yields were obtained [14b–d]. Iron hydrido-borohydride PNP analogues exhibit good catalytic activity but suffer from fast deactivation and thus require higher catalyst loadings to reach comparable performances [25]. Benefiting from PNN pincer-type ligand design, Gusev osmium complexes achieved this transformation in moderate to high yield [15a,15c]. In almost all the cases, the addition of a base, typically an alkali metal alkoxide in large excess, was still necessary to enable reaching higher catalytic activity [14a,15c]. In the present study, we focused on ruthenium complexes featuring archetypal aliphatic PNP ligands based on the amino-bis(2-phosphinoethyl) framework, with variation of phosphine substituents. We applied the as-designed catalytic systems in the ADC reactions under base-free conditions. We further addressed mechanistic and kinetic modelling aspects, which allowed us to rationalize previous experimental observations from the literature. We could thus highlight previously underestimated engineering aspects that are definitely key to achieve a larger process efficiency for this reaction."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Synthesis and characterisation of (pre)catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis and characterisation of (pre)catalysts The complexes used in the present study are displayed on Fig. 2 . 1a–c, 2c, 3a, 3c, 4 and 5 have been reported in the literature [14c,21a,26,27]. Several of them (1c, 2c and 5) are now commercially available. We describe here the synthesis and characterisation of the missing elements of the series (2a, 2b, 3b). The main spectroscopic features of the complexes are given in Table 1 for comparison. This combines both new and previously reported data for enabling a complete overview of the whole series. For sake of rigorous comparison, all the herein reported spectroscopic data are issued from analyses of the present study. Complexes 1a–b and 1d were prepared in good yield (82% and 78%, respectively), using a method reported in the literature (Scheme 3 ) [14c]. Indeed, heating an equimolar mixture of [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3] and ligand La , b at 165°C in diglyme results in the stereoselective formation of complexes featuring mutually trans N–H and Ru–H, as shown by 1H–1H 2D NOESY experiments (see Supplementary Data). For the ligand Ld bearing tert-butyl substituents at the phosphorous atom, a mixture of two isomeric hydride complexes (1d1 and 1d2 ) in a 1:5 ratio was obtained, as previously observed by Ding, who, however, did not discuss the nature of the observed compounds [28]. Elemental analysis is fully in line with the presence of isomers. 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3 of the minor isomer (1d1 ) features a characteristic Ru–H triplet at −16.01ppm, which thus falls in the same chemical shift order as that of hydrides from complexes 1a–b (Table 1). Moreover, a 2D 1H–1H NOESY NMR experiment showed that the N–H and the hydride are mutually in cis position. The major isomer (1d2 ) gives rise to a significantly shielded triplet at −21.9ppm. The amino proton resonates as an unusually deshielded broad triplet at 6.34ppm, to be compared with 2.74ppm in 1d1 . 2D 1H–1H NOESY NMR does not show any spatial proximity between the amino group and the ruthenium hydride. Moreover, the 15N chemical shift is around 57ppm (2D 1H–15N HSQC NMR), confirming the amino form (vide infra). Based on these spectroscopic observations, we proposed that 1d2 is an amino hydride pentacoordinated cationic complex, with H-bonding interaction between the N–H and the outer-sphere chloride anion. The new borohydride complexes 2a and 2b were prepared in high yields (90% and 88%, respectively) by treating the respective chloride precursors 1a and 1b with NaBH4 in a EtOH/PhMe mixture at 65°C, using a procedure modified compared to that used for yielding commercially available 2c (Scheme 3) [29]. The synthesis could be achieved using a lower amount of NaBH4, thus affording the compound with minor boron salts side products generation. Compounds 2a and 2b were characterised by multinuclear NMR, infrared and elemental analysis. Their 1H NMR spectra respectively display [Ru]–H signals at −13.52 and −13.60ppm (triplet, J HP c.a. 17Hz), and broad [Ru]–HBH3 peaks centered around −2.30ppm, indicating fast exchange on the NMR time-scale. Investigations by 2D 1H–1H NOESY NMR on 2a and 2b revealed that N–H and BH4 moieties are mutually in cis position (see Supplementary Data). In both cases, a singlet was observed in 31P{1H} NMR at 77.8 (2a) and 68.9ppm (2b), as well as in 11B{1H} NMR (Table 1). The coordination mode of the borohydride was determined as monohapto from infrared spectroscopy, as it comprises a characteristic pattern in the ν(BH) region [30]. The solid state structure of 2a was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction study (Fig. 3 ). The ruthenium center features a distorted octahedral configuration, with the PNP ligand in a meridional configuration, and with the carbonyl group in trans position to the N–H. Apical positions are occupied by the BH4 and by the hydride, which is in trans configuration relative to the N–H hydrogen in agreement with the 1H–1H NMR NOESY study. The geometry, bond lengths and angles are similar to those of the iron analogue [FeH(HBH3)(CO)(La ] [31]. Bishydride species 3a–b were obtained by chloride/hydride exchange from the corresponding hydrido chloride derivatives in yields of 92 and 69%, respectively, upon treatment with NaHBEt3 at room temperature (Scheme 3) [21a,32]. The new species 3b features spectroscopic properties close to that of 3a, such as the expected 1H NMR hydride signals (−6.17 and −6.14ppm, td, 2 J HP =19.2Hz and 2 J HH =4.2Hz), and gives rise to a singlet at 80.5ppm in the 31P NMR spectrum. Regarding 3c, attempts to purify the complex after its preparation using similar procedure were thwarted by fast decomposition in solution into unidentified species. Nevertheless, the compound identity could be assessed based on similar spectroscopic properties compared to 3a and 3b (Table 1). During attempts to crystalize 3c in a CH2Cl2/Et2O mixture, single crystals of the known [RuCl2(CO)(Lc )] complex were obtained, which consist of a mixture of trans and cis isomers in a 15:1 ratio, respectively. As only the trans-[RuCl2(CO)(Lc )] form is structurally characterised [15b,20a], we present here the structure of the cis analogue (Fig. 4 ). It features a distorted octahedral geometry with a meridional tridentate PNP ligand. Both Cl1 and Cl1b chloride ligands are mutually in cis position. One chloride is apically located on the same side of the Ru-PNP plane (cis position) with the amino hydrogen atom. Accordingly, the carbonyl ligand occupies the remaining apical position trans to the amino hydrogen atom. Applying the same reaction conditions to 1d leads to the known amido monohydride 4 instead of the targeted bishydride 3d [26]. The solid-state structure of this compound was determined using X-ray diffraction (Fig. 5 ). Ruthenium features a distorted square pyramidal geometry, with the PNP ligand in a meridional configuration, the carbonyl ligand in trans position to the amido, and the hydride ligand in the apical position. The sp2 hybridation of the N atom is evidenced by the sum of angles (354.82°). Bond lengths and angles are comparable to the trimethylphosphine coordinated analogue [RuH(L)(La )] (L=CO, PMe3) [32,33]. Presumably, spontaneous release of H2 from (non-isolated) 3d affords compound 4. Under 1bar H2 in C6D6, compound 3d is formed in about 80%, which allows its spectroscopic characterisation by multinuclear NMR (Table 1). Spectroscopic data are indeed comparable to the 3a–c derivatives. Upon flushing with argon, 4 is fully regenerated. As a general comment, over these series of compounds, we noted that 2D 1H–15N NMR is a very informative spectroscopic tool to determine the nature of nitrogen atom bonding, as this nucleus features significantly distinct chemical shifts between amino (30–50ppm) and amido structures (∼180ppm, Table 1)."
3,Catalytic investigations,"2.2 Catalytic investigations Having at hand this series of complexes, we proceeded to the systematic investigation of their catalytic performances in the benchmark n-butanol acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reaction using a 240ppm catalyst loading, that is, with a substrate-to-catalyst ratio of about 4150 (Table 2 and Fig. 6 ). For this purpose, we monitored the composition of the reaction mixture over time. As reported, the chloride derivatives 1 were not active under base-free conditions (Table 2, Entry 1). Upon addition of a base [14a,15b], (1.3mol% EtONa, that is around 52 equivalent to Ru), these complexes led to very active catalytic systems with TOF0 up to 2600h−1, producing butyl butyrate in good to excellent yields (Table 2, Entries 2–4). However, the use of the alkoxide base had a detrimental effect on selectivity. It induced the formation of heavier alcohols via the Guerbet reaction (see Supplementary Data) detected as mixed esters [34]. Though minor, these side-reactions lessen the interest of this transformation, as they imply the use of additional purification steps to separate these compounds upon upscaling. On the other hand, the borohydride and dihydride analogues 2–3 enabled n-butanol conversion under base-free conditions, here again achieving good to excellent yields, except for 3b for which a 70% yield was obtained. Moreover, at any reaction time, for 2a–c and 3a–c, the selectivity was larger than 99%, the reaction mixture being free of any detectable side product. Complexes 2a–c exhibited activities comparable to those of complexes 1a–c with TOF0 ranging from 2220h−1 and 2770h−1 (Table 2, Entries 5–7). Complexes 3a–c were slightly less active with TOF0 ranging from 1930 to 2090h−1 (Table 2, Entries 8–10). Complex 3a gave a nearly quantitative yield while Gusev et al. reported modest results (21% yield, 6h) with a higher catalyst loading (1000ppm). n-Butanol substrate quality as well as its purification procedure could be at the origin of this discrepancy since the authors reported a high yield (91%, 4h) for the isoamyl alcohol ADC reaction [14c]. Complex 3b bearing cyclohexyl substituents was less robust with a catalyst deactivation after 2h. Erratic results were obtained with complex 3c, in line with the difficulties encountered previously during its purification (see above). While amido monohydride complexes are commonly proposed as the active species in this reaction, no n-butanol conversion was observed in the presence of complex 4d (Table 2, Entry 11). Treatment of 4d with ethanol (1 equiv.) at room temperature or at 80°C in C6D6 did not give rise neither to the formation of any new complex nor to alcohol-derived reaction products. Interestingly, this complex was successfully used in primary alcohol oxidation into the corresponding acid, though with a significantly lesser activity than derivatives featuring less bulky substituents on the phosphorous centers, which tends to indicate that too high steric protection is detrimental to the catalytic activity [26,33]. Finally, in order to compare our results with those of other commercially available ruthenium catalysts active in the absence of a base, we probed Milstein’s catalyst’s (5) performance under similar reaction conditions. This compound proved to be less active: after an induction period of about 2h, conversion rose with a TOF0 of 290h−1 and with a maximal yield of 85% within 23h (Table 2, Entry 12). Regarding the influence of the pre-catalysts structure, we noticed that the hydrido chloride systems combined with a base lead to highly active systems, but are plagued by selectivity issues. On the other hand, the bishydrido compounds appear as more sensitive than the other pre-catalysts, and may achieve lower yields. When combined to the issues encountered during isolation attempts, this indicates that the sensitivity of bishydride species complicates their handling and use as catalysts. On the other hand, the borohydride derivatives, which may be considered as BH3-protected bishydrides, are more robust and provide activities and productivities similar to or better than that of 1a–c/base systems. Moreover, catalyst activation was fast and no induction period was observed. Mechanistically, BH3 release could occur upon thermal treatment or could be promoted by a nucleophile such as the alcohol substrate. This was recently investigated by NMR experiments and DFT calculations by Guan in the case of the iron derivative: the trans-[FeH2(CO)(La )] complex was formed from the borohydride species either in situ upon heating or in the presence of phosphine as borane scavenger [35]. Moreover, activation of 2c was reported to proceed with a 10–15min induction time in fatty methyl esters hydrogenation at 135°C that may also be partially attributed, in our opinion, to its low solubility [19a]. When comparing the 1/base and 2 catalytic systems, it is most likely that the side products generated during activation (NaCl for 1a–c, BH3 and derivatives for 2a–c) are not innocent toward species involved in catalysis, as, for instance, chloride sources proved to be detrimental to catalytic activity [36]. This may explain the slightly better results obtained with the hydrido-borohydride derivatives. When comparing the influence of the phosphorus substituent, we can observe only a slight influence, putting aside the extreme case of the tert-butyl derivatives. The observed marginal differences are difficult to rationalize, and the ranking of the (pre)-catalysts within the series is not identical. For instance, in the bishydride series (3a–c), that is, starting with the (postulated) actual species involved in the catalytic cycle, P-substituents (iPr, Cy, Ph) have no obvious effect on the initial activity (Table 2; Entries 8–10). When considering robustness, based on final yield, the trend is iPr>Ph>Cy. For the next step of the study, we selected commercially available complex 2c for the scope, temperature and catalyst concentration studies. All the tested primary alcohols were transformed into the corresponding ester in high yield with an excellent selectivity (Table 3 ). Heavier linear alcohols were transformed at slightly higher rates than n-butanol (Table 3, Entries 3–4), since the reaction mixture temperature is not limited by the alcohols boiling point (i.e., 130°C for higher alcohol vs. 118°C for n-butanol). Steric hindrance had a detrimental effect on the reaction rate, as β-substituted alcohols are converted at a slower rate (TOF0 ranging from 1280h−1 to 1640h−1, Table 3, Entries 5–6). We tentatively probed the reaction temperature influence on conversion mediated by 2c. However, at lower temperatures, solubility issues (or catalytic initiation) hampered efficient catalysis to take place [19a,35]. Seemingly sluggish reaction is observed at 80°C (7% conversion after 5h, 290 TON). Better results were obtained at 100°C, namely 33% conversion after 5h (1370 TON). Subsequent investigations were focused on the effect of the catalyst loading in order to probe the system’s limitation, as reported in Table 4 . Interestingly, lowering catalyst 2c concentration from 500 to 100ppm did not impact the final, nearly quantitative yield (Table 4, Entries 1–3), but gave rise to a more active catalytic system with a higher TOF0 (4650h−1, Table 4, Entry 3). Using lower catalytic loadings (60 and 20ppm, Table 4, Entries 4–5) led to an even more initially active (up to TOF0 =5600h−1), but less robust, catalytic system with catalytic deactivation after 5h (TON=14,900; butyl butyrate yield=35%, Table 4, Entry 5), which shows the limitations of this system. The catalytic behaviour of iPr-substituted 2a and Cy-substituted 2b was also probed at low catalytic loading in order to further investigate the phosphorous substituent effect. At 60ppm, while 2a gives good conversion (87%, Table 4, Entry 6), 2b affords a lower yield in butyl butyrate (71%, Table 4, Entry 8). Initial activities are comparable for both species, with TOF0 around 4400h−1. With a 20ppm catalyst loading, productivity of the system drops in both cases (Table 4, Entries 7 and 9). Interestingly, the initial activity is significantly increased in the case of 2a, with an initial turnover frequency of 6100h−1, higher than that of 2b (4600h−1). When discussing the ranking of the 2a–c pre-catalysts, one may consider the initial turnover frequency as a good indicator, although it is disconnected from long-term robustness (as this value is measured within the first stage of the catalytic runs, where no induction period is observed, and as catalysts decomposition occurs within 3–5h). Thus, it appears that the hydrido-borohydrides activity could be ranked as 2a (6100h−1)> 2c (5600h−1)> 2b (4600h−1). However, even if those represent the averages from results of 2 separate runs, these conclusions should be examined with caution, as the range of initial activities for different catalysts remains rather narrow, especially for 2a and 2c. As a last comment, it is noteworthy that the robustness of the systems follows the order: 2c ⩾ 2a > 2b. Interestingly, such a strong, beneficial catalyst concentration effect was previously reported in the literature by Gusev and coworkers and was at this stage not clearly understood [37]. A hypothesis of these authors is based on the potential formation of inactive, polynuclear aggregates at high catalyst concentrations. However, other physico-chemical phenomena could be at the origin of these observations. Indeed, even if the reaction proceeds efficiently under standard batch conditions, it is not thermodynamically favored (EtOH: ΔrG0 =14.5kJmol−1) and the equilibrium constant depends on the hydrogen concentration in the considered reaction mixture [38]. Also to be considered is the issue of Ru complex regeneration after dehydrogenation steps (that is, to close the catalytic cycle) that could be linked to hydrogen concentration in the liquid phase. During the reaction, the produced hydrogen is transferred from the liquid phase to the gas phase through the liquid–gas interface. If the hydrogen mass transfer is not efficient enough, hydrogen will temporarily accumulate in the liquid phase during the first stage of the reaction. Higher catalyst loadings are naturally expected to generate larger hydrogen amounts of which the release from the liquid media could be limited by the mass transfer efficiency of the reactor. In order to better understand the relationship between hydrogen concentration in the liquid phase and the catalytic system performances, we studied the effect of the stirring rate, as it is well-known to strongly influence the liquid–gas mass transfer efficiency and, consequently, hydrogen accumulation. Building on this hypothesis, we studied complex 2c’s catalytic activity (60ppm, 80g n-butanol scale) at various stirring rates in a 250mL double-walled reactor fitted with a Teflon impeller and Teflon baffles allowing a good thermal and stirring control (Table 5 ). In all cases, butyl butyrate was produced in a high yield (90%) with an excellent selectivity. The catalyst apparent initial activity, ranging from 2880h−1 at 300rpm (rpm: rotations per minute) to 5440h−1 at 1800rpm, increased with the stirring rate, demonstrating that the liquid–gas exchange is indeed largely influenced by the level of hydrogen accumulation in the liquid phase (Fig. 7 )."
4,Kinetic modelling of the ADC process,"2.3 Kinetic modelling of the ADC process In order to check our hypothesis that hydrogen accumulation in the liquid phase is actually correlated to the catalytic system performances, and since this hydrogen concentration was not directly measurable, we have developed a model including chemical steps and hydrogen liquid–gas mass transfer to simulate the experiments, from Table 5, which were performed under semi-batch conditions. The objective of this methodology is to give a quantitative description of all the phenomena lumping together chemistry and physical aspects. Thus, a simplified approach was proposed, based on the commonly proposed catalytic cycle (Scheme 4 ) [14a]. It involves the formation of an amido monohydride ruthenium(II) Cat-H from the trans-dihydride ruthenium(II) complex Cat-H2 through hydrogen release (connected to the above-described compounds of type 4 and 3, respectively). Then, an alcohol dehydrogenation step gives back Cat-H2 and produces aldehyde. The latter is quickly trapped by an alcohol molecule, giving a hemiacetal intermediate. Finally, through another connected catalytic loop, hemiacetal dehydrogenation by Cat-H releases the ester and regenerates the trans-dihydride Cat-H2 . Based on this well-accepted mechanism, a homogeneous catalytic kinetic model was proposed, by considering pseudo first-order reaction kinetics for each of the reaction steps. All the species framed in Scheme 4 were considered in the calculations. As the substrate scope (Table 3) revealed a detrimental steric bulk effect on reactivity, the rate of the two different dehydrogenation steps for n-butanol and the corresponding hemiacetal are considered as different (designated as r 1 and r 3, respectively). In our case, just as in previous reports neither aldehyde nor hemiacetal intermediates have been observed in the reaction mixture [14a,15b]. These are thus reactive species that do not accumulate in the reactor. The acetalization step (rate r 2) that transforms the aldehyde into the hemiacetal is therefore considered as fast, possibly being a metal-catalysed process [25]. Obviously, the amino-bishydride Cat-H2 to amido-hydride Cat-H reaction that corresponds to the regeneration of the catalyst is identical for both dehydrogenation steps (rate r 4). The reaction rate of each step in Scheme 4 can be expressed as follows: (1) r 1 = k 1 · C 1 · C 2 (2) r 2 = k 2 · C 1 · C 3 (3) r 3 = k 3 · C 8 · C 2 (4) r 4 = k 4 · C 4 (5) r 5 = k La · C 6 C 1, C 2, C 3, C 4, C 6, C 7 and C 8 represent the concentrations of the following species: primary alcohol, active form of catalyst (Cat-H), aldehyde intermediate, inactive form of catalyst (Cat-H2 ), hydrogen in liquid and gas phase, and hemiacetal intermediate, respectively. k 1–k 4 and k La are rate constants for each step. The liquid–gas mass transfer of H2 (r 5) is taken into account by using the double-film theory, and assuming that the mass-transfer resistance is only significant on the liquid side, and not on the gas side. We have also assumed that hydrogen concentration in the interface was negligible since the argon flow rate was high enough to lead to a negligible H2 partial pressure in the gas phase. With this model, the influence of the concentration of H2 in the liquid phase is supposed to impact the ratio between the active Cat-H and inactive Cat-H2 forms of the catalyst. According to the mass balance equations, which are presented below (Eqs. (11)–(18)), it is not possible to determine a simple expression that would correlate hydrogen concentration and the ratio between the active and the inactive form of the catalyst, due to the complexity of the corresponding mathematic system. This can only be obtained through the complete integration of the ordinary differential equations using numerical calculations. Furthermore, regarding the H2 liquid–gas transfer process, the k La constant, namely the volumetric mass-transfer coefficient, depends on numerous parameters linked to the reactor stirrer and to the physico-chemical properties of the presently involved fluids (like viscosity and density). In other words, the k La parameter does not directly depend on the ADC process chemistry. In order to decrease the number of kinetic constants to be determined through numerical adjustment to a more reasonable but still reliable number, k La has been estimated from a correlation developed for a mechanically agitated tank of a similar volume (Eq. (6)) [39]. (6) k La = 1.5 ∗ 10 - 4 × Re 1.45 × Sc 0.5 × We 0.5 × D H 2 / d 2 with (7) Re = Nc 2 × ρ L / μ L (8) Sc = μ L / ρ L D H 2 (9) We = c 2 D H 2 where N is the stirring rate, d is the impeller diameter, ρ is the liquid volumetric mass, μ is the liquid dynamic viscosity, σ is the surface tension and D H2 is the bulk diffusivity of H2 in the liquid phase. The correlation has thus been rearranged as follows: (10) k La = 1.5 ∗ 10 - 4 × N 2.45 × ρ 1.45 × d 2.4 μ 0.95 × σ 0.5 D H 2 0.5 Within this correlation, k La is strongly correlated with the impeller rotation rate N (power 2.45). Since the reaction is performed under neat conditions, physical properties of the liquid are expected to change during the reaction (viscosity, density, surface tension, diffusivity…), between reaction’s start and end (for instance, by a factor 2 in mixture diffusivity). Thus, as the mass-transfer coefficient k La depends on the reaction mixture physical properties, it was then recalculated as a function of time by taking into account the evolution of density, diffusivity and viscosity using values estimated from the Prosim(c) database. Density was found as being mostly constant with the reaction advancement, allowing us to consider a volume remaining constant with time. Using the rate equations, the mass balance equations for all the components of the reaction network are thus given by the following expressions: (11) dC 1 / dt = - r 1 - r 2 (12) dC 2 / dt = - r 1 - r 3 + r 4 (13) dC 3 / dt = r 1 - r 2 (14) dC 4 / dt = r 1 + r 3 - r 4 (15) dC 5 / dt = r 3 (16) dC 6 / dt = r 4 - r 5 (17) dC 7 / dt = r 5 (18) dC 8 / dt = r 2 - r 3 All the kinetic parameters k 1–k 4 have then to be determined in order to fit the experimental concentrations of substrate and product with the calculated ones. To do so, a non-linear regression was performed by using MATLAB®R2014a. The subroutine “ode15s” was used in the integration of the ordinary differential equations (mass balance), whereas the subroutine “LSQCURVEFIT” (Trust-region reflective) was applied in the non-linear regression. The as-calculated concentration profiles of n-butanol and butyl butyrate were then compared with the experimental ones from the catalytic runs described in Table 5. The Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) between the calculated and the experimental concentration was used as the objective function to obtain the optimum kinetic parameters (Eq. (19)): (19) RSS = ∑ i = 1 n ( experimental data ) ( C exp , i - C calc , i ) 2 where n refers to the considered experimental data set. The parameter estimation was performed by following a built-in option, i.e., by using the last estimation result as a starting point for the next one. Table 6 shows the kinetic constants k 1–k 4 obtained using our methodology, along with the different values used for k La, calculated according to Eq. (10). The quality of the fit is deemed acceptable according to the parity plot presented in Fig. 8 . Note that k 1–k 4 represent a unique set of parameters that are not depending on the experimental conditions. According to the standard deviation (σ) obtained from the non-linear regression method, only k 1 and k 2 are to be considered as reliable values, as they feature the lowest σ values. Nevertheless, the higher value for k 3 is in line with the fact that no hemiacetal species was observed under our conditions (despite the large standard deviation). When instantaneous rates are plotted against time as presented in Fig. 9 , we can see that all the rates r 1 to r 5 are similar in terms of magnitudes except for the beginning of the reaction for r 3, as this reaction rate depends on the primary aldehyde product. There is no clear limiting rate in our simplified reaction network, in which some rates are moreover very close (r 1 and r 2; r 4 and r 5). Fig. 10 shows an example of the evolution of the computed concentrations of substrate and product as a function of time at 1200rpm (Table 5, entry 3). We can observe a deviation for long reaction times between the predicted and the experimental concentrations in n-butanol. This is attributed to the deactivation of the Ru catalyst. We checked that, even in the presence of a significant reverse reaction (ester to alcohol), the trend obtained from the simulation was not modified. We can also observe that an accumulation of the bishydride form (Cat-H2 ) takes place during the reaction due to an accumulation of hydrogen in the liquid phase. The differences measured in terms of TOF by varying the impeller rotation rate are then fully explained by the performances of the reactor related to the liquid–gas mass transfer (expressed by the value of k La). The higher this value, the more efficient the liquid–gas mass transfer, which means a lower accumulation of hydrogen in the liquid phase. This is confirmed by Fig. 11 that features the calculated H2 concentration in the liquid phase as a function of time for different stirring rates. Along these lines, we can also conclude that the process performances could be improved if the liquid–gas mass transfer could be intensified. The actual (maximal) TOF0 has not been reached under the herein considered experimental conditions, as H2 stripping is still a limiting factor (in a semi-batch even if minimal the H2 concentration is still not null, and there is therefore room for process efficiency improvement). An ideal case would be to suppress accumulation of H2 in the liquid phase, consequently avoiding build-up of the Cat-H2 non-active form. In other terms, within the catalytic cycle, efficient H2 release from reaction mixture would not hinder regeneration of Cat-H. For implementation of an industrial process, this issue has to be considered to optimize productivity, and for laboratory-scale experiments, it can be responsible of severe deviation between studies involving different experimental set-ups."
5,Conclusions,"Base-free catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenative homo-coupling of alcohols to esters under neat conditions was investigated. Bifunctional ruthenium aliphatic PNP complexes shown to be very active toward transformation of various primary aliphatic alcohols, achieving up to 15,000 TON. From the reaction conditions optimization, severe mass transfer issues related to H2 by-product release were identified. Namely, the apparent initial activities were limited by hydrogen diffusion, due to insufficient liquid–gas transfer of the released hydrogen from the reaction mixture. From a mechanistic point of view, this is related to the couple amido monohydride/amino bishydride: the conversion of the latter into the former is the last step which is necessary to complete the catalytic cycle. Inhibition of this reaction affects the apparent reaction rate. Overcoming this by switching into the chemical regime leads to an initial turnover frequency increase from about 2900 up to 5400h−1. This has a significant impact when considering assessment of novel or reported catalytic systems in this type of reaction: overlooking of these engineering aspects can be misleading and therefore, greater attention should be paid to catalytic setup for, e.g., further larger scale implementation of such processes."

7,Instruments and reagents,"4.1 Instruments and reagents All the experiments were carried out under argon atmosphere using a glove-box or a vacuum line using standard Schlenk techniques. All the ruthenium complexes and PNP ligands were stored under argon. 1-butanol (99.9%), 1-pentanol (99%), 1-octanol (99.9%), 1-tetradecanol (97%), 2-methyl-1-butanol (99.0%), 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (99.6%) were purchased from Aldrich. Liquid alcohols were dried over activated 3A molecular sieves (20wt%) for 48h and outgassed by extensive argon bubbling prior to use. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Eurisotop and dried, distilled, outgassed prior to use. Dichloromethane-d2 was dried over CaH2, THF-d8 was dried over Na/benzophenone and benzene-d6 was dried over NaK alloy. Ligands La , Lb , Ld , [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3], 1c (trade name: Ru-MACHO), 2c (trade name: Ru-MACHO-BH) and 5 (Milstein catalyst) were purchased from Strem Chemicals. Previously reported complexes 1a, 1b, 3a and 4a were prepared following literature procedures [14c,21a]. GC-FID/MS was carried out on Agilent 7890A (flame ionization detector and MS detector) instrument equipped with a Zebron ZB-Bioethanol column (30m column length×0.25mm internal diameter×1.00μm film thickness) with helium as a carrier gas. 1H, 13P, 13C, 15N and 11B NMR spectra were recorded at 300K on a Bruker Avance II 400 NMR spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported in ppm (δ) downfield from tetramethylsilane. 13P NMR chemical shifts are reported in ppm (δ) downfield from H3PO4. 15N NMR chemical shift are reported in ppm (δ) downfield from NH3, and were indirectly determined from 2D 1H–15N HMBC/HSQC. 11B NMR chemical shift are reported in ppm (δ) downfield from BF3⋅Et2O. Common abbreviations used in the NMR experiments are as follows: s singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), virtual triplet (vt), quartet (q), multiplet (m). IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a Praying Mantis mirror chamber (from Harrick Scientific) by using a DRIFT cell equipped with KBr windows. The samples were prepared under argon in a glove-box. Typically, 64 scans were accumulated for each spectrum (resolution 4cm−1). Data are reported as follows: weak (w), medium (m), strong (s) and very strong (vs)."

9,Catalytic tests,"4.3 Catalytic tests 4.3.1 TOF0 determination For all the alcohols acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reactions, the initial turnover frequency, i.e., TOF0, was determined from the plot of the turnover number as a function of time. The TOF0 was calculated from the slope of the linear regression performed on the initial linear part of the plot. In most of the cases, the catalytic tests were duplicated to ensure good repeatability. Yield, turnover number (TON) and turnover number frequency (TOF) are given as an average of two runs. See Supplementary Data for details. 4.3.2 Typical procedure for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 1-butanol conducted in Schlenk tubes In argon filled glove-box, the selected complex (0.026mmol; 240ppm) was weighted in a Schlenk tube containing a stirring bar. After connection to a Schlenk line, 1-butanol (10mL; 8.10g; 109mmol) was added via a syringe under an argon stream. The Schlenk tube was then equipped with a condenser topped by an argon bubbler. The system was heated using an oil bath (130°C) and stirred magnetically under an argon stream. Aliquots (ca. 0.1mL) were periodically sampled to monitor the reaction progress over time. The liquid samples were weighted, mixed with a known amount of cyclohexane (internal standard) and diluted with dichloromethane. The samples were then analysed by GC-FID/MS for determination of conversion, yield, turnover number, turnover frequency and mass balance analysis. Alternatively, aliquots were diluted with CDCl3 and analysed by 1H NMR for determination of yield, turnover number and turnover frequency. Both analytical methods gave identical results. 4.3.3 Typical procedure for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 1-butanol conduced in a double walled reactor. 4.3.3.1 Reactor description A 250mL double walled reactor (Radley) with a bottom valve and fitted with a Teflon impeller and Teflon baffles was used. The reactor lid ports were equipped with a reflux condenser topped with an oil bubbler, an argon inlet, an injector port closed with a septum and a dipping thermocouple. The reactor was heated and the reaction temperature monitored using a Huber Ministat 230 connected to the thermocouple dipped in the reaction mixture. Silicon oil was used as heating liquid. A Heidolph overhead mechanical stirrer was used for the impeller rotation and accurate control of the stirring rate. 4.3.3.2 Typical procedure The reactor was preheated to 100°C under a gentle argon flow for 4h. In an argon-filled glove-box, the catalyst 2c (38mg; 0.065mmol; 60ppm) was weighted and transferred to a pressure-equalized dropping funnel (custom built). Under argon flow, a first 1-butanol portion was introduced in three fractions via a 20mL syringe (3×20mL; 48g) into the reactor. The temperature set point was reduced to 80°C and the stirring was started with a rate of 100rpm. The septum was replaced by the pressure-equalized dropping funnel containing the powdered catalyst. Another 1-butanol portion (16g) was introduced into the dropping funnel giving a white suspension. Then, the suspension was added to the reactor. The dropping funnel was rinsed with the last portion of 1-butanol (16g; total: 80g; 1.08mol). At this point, the reaction media was a white-yellow suspension. The dropping funnel was replaced by a septum. The argon inlet was switched from lid reactor to the oil bubbler topping the reflux condenser. The circulating heating oil was set to 130°C and the stirring increased to the desired rate. After 5min (solution temperature ca. 90°C), all the catalyst was dissolved giving a slightly yellow solution. After 15min, reflux conditions were obtained (solution temperature ca. 112°C). At this time, a first aliquot (0.2mL) was taken, which corresponds to the reaction t0. Then, aliquots (ca. 0.2mL) were periodically sampled to monitor the reaction progress over time. Liquid samples were diluted with CDCl3 and analysed by 1H RMN to determine yield, turnover number and turnover number frequency."
10,X-ray structure determination,"4.4 X-ray structure determination A single crystal of each compound was mounted under inert perfluoropolyether wax on a Mitegen MicroLoop™. The single-crystal X-rays measurements were performed at 100K under N2 stream from a Cryostream 700 device (OxfordCryosystems). Data were collected using an Apex II CCD 4K Bruker diffractometer (λ =0.71073Å). The structures were solved using SHELXT and refined by least-squares procedures on F2 using SHELXL2014 [41,42]. All the hydrogen atoms were placed in theoretical positions and refined riding on their parent atoms except for the hydride H attached to the Ru atom, which was located from difference Fourier maps and refined isotropically. ORTEP drawings were generated with ORTEP-3 [43]. Crystallographic data have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as Supplementary Publication Nos. CCDC 1449421-1449423. Copies of the data can be obtained free of charge on application to the Director, CCDC, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, U.K. (fax: (+44) 1223 336 033; e-mail: deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk)."
11,Modelling experiments procedure,"4.5 Modelling experiments procedure Four catalytic runs varying by the impeller rotation speed (300, 800, 1200, 1800rpm) and conducted at the same temperature (measured temperature: 115°C) were selected (Table 5). The data were implemented into a single data file in the Matlab®R2014a software."
