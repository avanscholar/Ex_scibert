0,Introduction,"Against the background of increasing consumption of fossil fuels, hydrogen has drawn great attention as a promising sustainable energy carrier due to its high gravimetric energy density, ability to be derived from renewable energy sources, and environmental friendliness (zero emissions at point of use) [1–10]. Among various technologies, the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is regarded as one of the most promising methods for hydrogen production, making the development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts an area of intense research [11]. To date, platinum and platinum-group-based metals are predominantly used as the electrocatalysts for the HER, with the challenge of high cost and low crustal abundance impeding commercial use and further scale-up. Therefore, it is imperative to discover and develop high-efficiency, low-cost, and alternative non-noble metal electrocatalysts (e.g. transition-metal carbides [12,13], oxides [14,15], sulfides [16,17], selenides [18–20]). Generally, free H+ exhibits low adsorption energy during the HER process (Eqs. (1) and (2)) in acidic solution. However, it tends to form the hydronium ions (commonly formulated as H13O6 +) by surrounding water molecules via strong hydrogen-bond interactions, where each H(aq) + ion in water solvent is surrounded by six water molecules to form a much more stable hydronium ion [21–24]. As a result, the positive charge density of H+ is dramatically decreased owing to the hydration effect, which hinders the efficient adsorption of H+ on the surface of electrocatalyst. From the perspective of physical chemistry, the adsorption of H+ is regarded as the rate-determining step [25], making the hydration act as a bottleneck for the HER process. Recently, Feng et al. [26] discovered an efficient way to eliminate the effect of coordinate water molecules around H+ by constructing polyaniline (PANI) nanodots-decorated CoP supported on carbon fibers, leading to an enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward HER. This ingenious multi-dimensional structure inspires us that surface engineering may be an ideal strategy to avoid the hydration effect in metal-based electrocatalysts by creating a 3-phase boundary of electrocatalyst, electrolyte, and H2 gas during HER process. Recently, it has been reported that multi-transition metal-based compounds of group VI, nickel-cobalt-based oxide/sulfide/selenide [NiCo2A4 (A = O, S, Se)], display excellent electrocatalytic performance for the HER. According to our previous work, Lai et al. prepared a series of NiCo2O4 nanosheets wrapped hollow nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedrons with doped transition-metal domains, which are beneficial to boosting the electrocatalysis towards overall water splitting. The enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of energy level matching for electron transfer, and partial charge delocalization-induced rich active sites for reactant adsorption [27]. As demonstrated by Xue et al., this work reported GD-supported bifunctional electrodes using 3D GD foam as scaffolds and NiCo2S4 nanowires as building blocks, which exhibits outstanding catalytic activity and stability toward both OER and HER [28]. Furthermore, Fang et al. present a novel insight into tuning the HER electrocatalytic properties in Ni/Co-based HER electrocatalysts. The metallic nature and the synergistic effect of Ni/Co atoms favor the electron transfer kinetics between the catalyst and current collector, and the moderate electron delocalization reduces the barrier of proton binding, thus favoring the HER kinetics [29]. This is attributed to their high electrical conductivity [30,31], versatile redox nature [32,33] and hybrid orbitals [29,34], applying larger sizes of anions could expose more active sites with multivalent states for HER process. In spite of the similar chemical and electronic properties of oxygen, sulfur and selenium anions in NiCo2A4, their electrochemical properties are still strongly affected by the different spin-orbit coupling effects between cations and anions [35–38]. Of the relative positions within the group VI elements, the Se possesses the largest atomic radius (RSe: 117 pm; RS: 104 pm; RO: 66 pm) and the lowest electronegativity (Se: 2.48; S: 2.58; O: 3.44). This characteristic makes it much easier to transfer the electrons from the electrocatalyst substrate to the adsorbed H+. From the perspective of surface engineering, a pristine NiCo2A4 surface is not beneficial for an inhomogenous charge distribution to weaken the shackles of H+ ions in H13O6 +. In order to overcome these limitations and activate NiCo2A4 electrocatalysts, introducing atomic-scale modifications (such as the engineering of vacancies [39,40], heteroatom doping [41,42], and structural strain [43]) represents promising strategy. Among them, anionic vacancy engineering can introduce abundant point defects in NiCo2A4 crystals, leading to a rise in local charge density. These anionic vacancies can not only restrain the hydration effect for fast H+ adsorption, but also lower the energy barriers during the following hydrogen reduction processes. In this work, a series of anionic vacancy-rich NiCo2A4 (A = O, S, Se) nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs, A = O, S, Se) have been successfully prepared by combining a hydrothermal approach and controlled annealing treatment. The electrochemical HER test results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations consistently confirm that VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalysts display higher electrocatalytic activity than the corresponding vacancy-free NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs systems. The presence of anionic vacancy in VA-NiCo2A4 is beneficial for H+ capture from hydronium ions, and thus will weaken the shackles of hydronium ions to accelerate the HER. More importantly, the obtained VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalyst shows an optimized overpotential of 168 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in acid media and a low Tafel slope of 49.8 mV dec−1, which is much better than those of VS-NiCo2S4-NWs/NCNFs and VO-NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalysts. These results demonstrate that larger anionic vacancy size favours higher HER performance. Therefore, this work demonstrates the deeper correlation between anionic vacancy and intrinsic HER catalytic activity in multi-transition metal based electrocatalysts and provides novel insights into the design of electrocatalysts with outstanding durability and high efficiency."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of NCNF,"2.1 Preparation of NCNF The PAN nanofibers were prepared through a facile single-nozzle electrospinning technique using a commercial electrospinning system (UCALERY Beijing Co., Ltd, China). Typically, 0.9 g of PAN and 0.1 g of urea were dissolved in 9 g of N, N-dimethylformamide under vigorous stirring at room temperature to form a homogeneous electrospinning precursor solution. Then the precursor electrospinning solution was loaded into a 20 mL plastic syringe equipped with a stainless needle. Electrospinning process was carried out at a voltage of 15 kV at a feeding rate of 0.15 mm min−1 through a stainless needle. The distance between the aluminum drum collector and stainless needle was 30 cm. The pre-oxidized process of the PAN nanofiber membrane was conducted at 250 °C in air atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. The carbonization of electrospinning nanofibers was operated in a tube furnace under nitrogen atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. After that, nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers were obtained, and denoted as NCNF."
3,Preparation of Ni–Co-precursor nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers,"2.2 Preparation of Ni–Co-precursor nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers Typically, 0.5 mmol of Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O, 1 mmol of Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O, and 1.5 mmol of urea were added into 40 mL of deionized (DI) water, which was stirred for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution. Then, a piece of NCNF membrane (2 cm × 4 cm) was immersed into the above solution, and transferred into 80 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The tightly locked autoclave was maintained at 120 °C for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the membrane of Ni–Co-precursor nanowires (Ni–Co-pre-NWs) on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers was removed from the solution, washed with DI water and alcohol for several times to remove any unreacted residues, dried at 80 °C overnight, and denoted as Ni–Co-pre-NWs/NCNFs. Except for NCNF template, the pure Ni–Co-pre-NWs powder was obtained via the same steps for comparison."
4,Preparation of oxygen vacancy-rich NiCo2O4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers,"2.3 Preparation of oxygen vacancy-rich NiCo2O4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers The above Ni–Co-precursor nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers were heated in nitrogen atmosphere at 300 °C, resulting in the generation of oxygen vacancy-rich NiCo2O4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (VO–NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs). For comparison, the pristine NiCo2O4 nanowires on NCNFs (NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs) were obtained by annealing Ni–Co-pre-NWs/NCNFs in air atmosphere at 300 °C. In addition, the oxygen vacancy-rich NiCo2O4 nanowires powder was prepared by annealing pure Ni–Co-pre-NWs powder in nitrogen atmosphere at 300 °C (VO–NiCo2O4-NWs). Similarly, the NiCo2O4 nanowires powder was also prepared by annealing pure Ni–Co-pre-NWs powder in air atmosphere at 300 °C (NiCo2O4-NWs)."
5,Preparation of sulfur vacancy–rich NiCo2S4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers,"2.4 Preparation of sulfur vacancy–rich NiCo2S4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers Firstly, sodium sulfide (Na2S·xH2O) was used to prepare a 0.2 M solution in DI water. Then, a piece of NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs membrane (2 cm × 4 cm) was immersed into 40 mL of the above solution, transferred into 80 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and reacted at 180 °C for 6 h by using hydrothermal method. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was washed with ethanol and DI water for several times, followed by drying at 80 °C overnight, which was named as NiCo2S4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NiCo2S4-NWs/NCNFs). After high-temperature annealing treatment of NiCo2S4-NWs/NCNFs at 450 °C for 6 h, the sulfur vacancy-rich NiCo2S4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (VS–NiCo2S4-NWs/NCNFs) were successfully synthesized. Furthermore, the sulfur vacancy-rich NiCo2S4 nanowires powder (VS–NiCo2S4-NWs) was prepared from NiCo2O4-NWs via the same steps as VS-NiCo2S4-NWs/NCNFs, except for adding NCNF template."
6,Preparation of selenium vacancy-rich NiCo2Se4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers,"2.5 Preparation of selenium vacancy-rich NiCo2Se4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers Typically, 0.25 mmol of Na2SeOX was dissolved into 35 mL of DI water. Then, a piece of NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs membrane (2 cm × 4 cm) was immersed into the above solution. After dropping 5 mL of N2H4, the mixture was refluxed at 180 °C for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was washed with DI water and ethanol for several times, followed by drying at 80 °C for overnight. Subsequently, the NiCo2Se4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs) membrane was annealed in Ar/H2 atmosphere (Ar:H2 = 95:5, in volume) at 600 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 5 min−1, to obtain selenium vacancy-rich NiCo2Se4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs). Similarly, the selenium vacancy-rich NiCo2Se4 nanowires powder (VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs) was prepared from NiCo2O4-NWs via the same steps as VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs, except for adding NCNF template."
7,Electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical working station (CHI600D, Chenhua Instruments Co. Ltd., Shanghai) in a typical three-electrode configuration at room temperature with 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, where graphite rod, and Ag/AgCl reference electrode (3 M KCl) were used as counter and reference electrode, respectively. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out at 5 mV s−1. The stability test was recorded after 1000 CV cycle scanning at 50 mV s−1. The double layer capacitance (C dl ) was used to evaluate the active surface areas for composites, where the measured voltages are in a relatively narrow window without faradaic reaction processes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements was performed using a CHI 660D electrochemistry workstation by applying AC amplitude, with a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. All polarization curves were corrected with IR drop. Moreover, all potentials in this work were calibrated to corresponding potentials versus the RHE using the equation: E (RHE) = E Ag/AgCl + 0.212 + 0.0591*pH. The typical HER process in acidic solution can be divided into the following two radical steps (Eqs. (1) and (2)): (1) M + H+ ads + e → M − H (2) M−H + H+ + e →M + H2 The values of turnover frequency (TOF) were calculated by assuming that every atom (Ni, Co, O, S, Se) is involved in the catalysis (lower TOF limits were calculated) (Eq. (3)): (3) TOF = j × A 4 × F × n where j (mA cm─2) is the measured current density at η = 200, 250, 300 mV, A is the geometry surface area of electrode, F is Faraday’s constant (96485 C mol−1), and n is the moles of coated metal atom on the electrode calculated. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) were estimated by cyclic voltammetry and calibrated. In a narrow potential window, the electrode displays electrical double-layer capacitor mechanism without Faradaic processes, which was used to indicate the active surface areas for comparison. Subsequently, the double layer capacitance (C dl ) can be estimated by the half slope of the linearly fitted curve of the capacitive current (j = j anodic − j cathodic) plotted against the scan rate."
8,Characterization,"2.7 Characterization The morphology of the sample was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Ultra 55) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Talos F200S). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using an X’Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) at a current of 40 mA and voltage of 40 kV. The Raman spectra were collected using a LabRAM-HR Confocal Laser Micro Raman Spectrometer with a 532 nm laser diode as the excitation source. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were tested by using a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ/MP®XR system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi equipped with Al Kα X-ray source at an energy of 1486.6 eV. The curve fitting of all XPS spectra was accomplished using XPS Peak 4.1 software. All XPS spectra were calibrated according to the C 1s line at 284.8 eV, while curve fitting and background subtraction were accomplished using the RBD AugerScan 3.21 software provided by RBD Enterprises. The liquid phase samples were tested on a Varian 600 MHz spectrometer at ambient temperature, and the chemical shifts were calibrated by CD3SO."
9,Computational methods,"2.8 Computational methods First-principle calculations were performed by density functional theory (DFT), where Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) package is used [44]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used to describe the electronic exchange and correlation effects [45]. Spin-polarization was included for their magnetic properties. The calculated lattice constants are a = b = c = 5.52 Å after full relaxation. The K points meshing for Brillioun zone was set up as a 5 × 11 × 1 grid centered at the gamma point regarding Monkhorst Pack Scheme for geometric optimization of the slab surfaces. The simulation was run with a cutoff energy of 450 eV throughout the computations. Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [46], within the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [47]. The exchange-correlation interaction functional is described by generalized gradient approximation (GGA), in Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The strongly correlated interaction of Co 3d electrons is considered with GGA + U (U = 4.0 eV) method [48]. The cutoff energy of 500 eV was adopted for the plane-wave basis set. The structures were relaxed by conjugate gradient algorithm implemented in the VASP code until the forces on the atoms were less than 0.01 eV/Å. The criterion for the total energy is set as 1 × 10−5 eV."
10,Results and discussion,"The synthetic process of anionic vacancy-rich NiCo2A4 (A = O, S, Se) nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs, A = O, S, Se) is illustrated in Scheme 1 . Briefly, Ni–Co-precursor nanowires are uniformly coated on the nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as Ni–Co-pre-NWs/NCNFs) after a one-step hydrothermal process, the result of which has been characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), in Figs. S3 and S4, respectively. Under the assistance of an inert N2 atmosphere, the oxygen atoms in the crystal NiCo2O4 nanowires are more likely to escape from the surface with abundant oxygen vacancies left, resulting in the generation of oxygen vacancy-rich NiCo2O4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (VO–NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs) [49]. As the SEM image of VO-NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs (Fig. 1 a) shown, its well distributed VO-NiCo2O4 nanowires on the surface of NCNFs maintain the same as that in the NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs (Figs. S5a and b), which proves the oxygen vacancy fabrication process would not affect the corresponding morphology. In addition, another two electrocatalysts of sulfur vacancy-rich NiCo2S4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (VS–NiCo2S4-NWs/NCNFs) and selenium vacancy-rich NiCo2Se4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs) were synthesized through anionic substitution and thermal treatment of NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs, in which sulfur and selenium vacancies can be created owing to the intrinsically higher volatility of the chalcogen atoms in an inert atmosphere [50]. Similarly, the nanowire arrays of VS-NiCo2S4-NWs/NCNFs (Figs. S6a and b) and VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs (Fig. 1b) are maintained after the selenation/sulfuration and annealing treatment. Due to the existence of the NCNFs template, the VA-NiCo2A4 (A = O, S, Se) nanowires are more likely to anchor along the nanofiber direction instead of the generation of VA-NiCo2A4 (A = O, S, Se) aggregations (Figs. S5c and d, S6d, S7c and d), which is beneficial to increasing the specific surface area, as well as the number of active sites for the following electrochemical reactions. By taking VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs and selenium vacancy-rich NiCo2Se4 nanowires (VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs) powder as a couple of contrasting examples, their nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distributions are provided in Fig. S8. The VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs shows a higher speciﬁc surface area (SSA) (120.5 m2 g−1) than that (98.5 m2 g−1) of VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs powder. Revealed by the pore size distribution curves (Fig. S8b), both of the VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs and VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs present well-developed mesopores with pore diameters of 3–5 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of VO-NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs and VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs are provided in Fig. 1c and d, which show that the diameters of the corresponding nanowires are around 80 and 100 nm, respectively. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs (Fig. 1e) clearly shows a lattice spacing of 0.27 nm, corresponding to the (002) facet of NiCo2Se4. This result demonstrates that the potential introduction of selenium vacancies has little impacts on the main crystal structure of NiCo2Se4. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy of high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was employed (Fig. 1f and g), which further confirms the homogeneous distribution of Co, Ni and Se elements in VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs. Moreover, the phase purity and crystal structure of VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs (A = O, S, Se) electrocatalysts were tested by XRD. A broad diffraction hump from 20° to 30° was observed in the XRD pattern, which is attributed to the amorphous carbon phase (JCPDS card no. 01-0646) in NCNFs. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared VA-NiCo2A4 (A = O, S, Se) NWs/NCNFs samples match well with those of the standard PDF card of NiCo2Se4 (Fig. S9), NiCo2O4 (Fig. S10), and NiCo2S4 (Fig. S11). It should be noted that the NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs samples exhibit similar XRD patterns as the VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNF samples, which indicates their crystalline structures were almost unchanged after the introduction of anionic vacancies. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded to probe the chemical states and generation of anionic vacancies in VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs. As illustrated in Fig. 2 a, Ni 2p3/2 (855.8 eV) and Ni 2p1/2 (873.4 eV) in VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs are observed with a negative shift of 0.2 eV when compared with those of NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs (Ni 2p3/2: 856.0 eV; Ni 2p1/2: 873.6 eV). Similarly, the peaks of the binding energies for Co 2p3/2 (780.8 eV) and Co 2p1/2 (796.8 eV) in VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs are also negatively shifted after the introduction of Se vacancies (Fig. 2b) [51–53]. Furthermore, the negative shifts of binding energies with values of ∼0.1 eV for both Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d5/2 peaks in VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs (Fig. 2c) provide the best evidence for the generation of Se vacancies [54,55]. In addition, the high-resolution N 1s spectrum of VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs (Fig. 2d) can be deconvoluted into three nitrogen-containing species: pyridinic-N (398.4 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.7 eV) and graphitic-N (400.8 eV). These binding energy values exhibit positive shifts of 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3 eV for pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N, respectively, when compared with those in NCNFs. These negative shifts in the binding energies of Co 2p and Ni 2p, and the positive shift in N 1s, indicate the electrons are easier to transfer from the NCNFs host to outside VSe–NiCo2Se4 arrays due to their excellent electronic interactions. The tight interfacial connection between VSe–NiCo2Se4 and NCNFs is beneficial to generate a charge-rich boundary for fast electron transport during HER [56,57]. In addition, the successful introduction of oxygen and sulfur vacancies in VO-NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs and VS-NiCo2S4-NWs/NCNFs is also demonstrated in the Supporting Information (Figs. S12 and S13). To investigate the role of the anionic vacancy in VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs for the HER electrocatalysis, a standard three-electrode system was operated in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Meanwhile, commercial Pt/C was also evaluated for comparison. The IR-corrected polarization curves and Tafel plots of VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs and Pt/C are showed in Fig. 3 a and b. Notably, the VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalyst displays not only the lowest overpotential of 168 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3c), but also the smallest Tafel slope of 49.8 mV dec−1 among three VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs samples. Meanwhile, the VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs show lower overpotential values and smaller Tafel slopes than the corresponding pristine counterparts (Fig. S14), demonstrating the incorporation of anionic vacancy efficiently boosts the electrocatalytic activity. The high electrocatalytic performance of VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs even approaches that of the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst, while its low cost and tunable structure have the potential to be optimized for renewable hydrogen energy production. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to study the various loss mechanisms for each system. The Nyquist plots in Fig. 3d show that the VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalyst has the smallest transport resistances among three VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalysts, which means its fastest electron-transfer process during HER steps. This could be attributed from the tight interfacial connection between VSe–NiCo2Se4 nanowires and highly conductive NCNFs support for enhanced interfacial electronic conductivity. Meanwhile, both of the intrinsic and superficial electronical structures in VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalyst are well modulated after incorporating anionic vacancies, leading to an increased number of active sites for boosted HER process due to the enhanced electron transfer. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) tested by CV curves (Fig. S15) was used to measure the electrochemical surface areas of different samples (Fig. 3e). The C dl value of VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs (14.9 mF cm−2) is much higher than those of VS-NiCo2S4-NWs/NCNFs (11.1 mF cm−2) and VO-NiCo2O4-NWs/NCNFs (3.9 mF cm−2), proving the fact that VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs has the largest active surface area and larger surface coverage of active sites. Turnover frequency (TOF) value is a crucial factor in revealing the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. Among the three VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalysts, the as-prepared VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs shows the highest TOF value as 0.453 s−1 at an overpotential of 250 mV, which is much larger than those of the corresponding sulfide (0.119 s−1) and oxide samples (0.014 s−1) (Fig. S16). Similarly, VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs exhibit higher TOF value than pristine NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs samples based on Eq. (3) (Fig. S17), which indicates the enhanced atom-utilization efficiency among three VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs samples and thus exposes more active sites for HER process. Finally, the long-term durability of VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs was evaluated by performing CV scanning over 1000 cycle (Fig. 3f), which only shows slight degradation and suggests its outstanding durability. A comparison of VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs with other reported HER electrocatalysts in acid media is provided in Table S1, where the VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs shows superior catalytic performance than most transition metal-based for HER catalysis. To better understand the reason for the enhanced HER catalytic performance, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to study the relationship between anionic vacancy and electrocatalytic activity for HER by constructing the simplified models (Fig. 4a, b and Figs. S19–S22). As revealed by the density of states (DOS) of NiCo2O4, NiCo2S4, and NiCo2Se4 (Fig. 4c and Fig. S22), the NiCo2Se4 crystal displays the highest intensity near the Fermi level, which demonstrates the superior electrical properties of NiCo2Se4 (particularly in the electrical conductivity and carrier concentration. It corresponds well with EIS results, where the interfacial electronic conductivity could be enhanced with the substitution of anion. Furthermore, the generated VSe in VSe–NiCo2Se4 also enhances its DOS intensity near the Fermi level (Fig. 4 d), which contributes to its higher charge density and better electrical conductivity than pristine NiCo2Se4. It is in agreement with the enhanced HER catalytic activity shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S14. This implies that the highest potential for the adsorption of H+ ions near the Se vacancy in NiCo2Se4 and this differential charge distribution can provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions, making the following HER steps much easier. To further uncover the HER mechanism, the chemical environment of hydronium ions in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte was investigated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). As shown in Fig. 4f, three 1H NMR signals at ∼4.3, ∼4.7, and ∼6.9 ppm were obtained in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, in comparison to only one 1H NMR signal at ∼4.5 ppm in pure water; these three signals are ascribed to HSO4 −, water and H13O6 +, respectively. A slight positive shift of ∼0.2 ppm for the water and an obvious negative shift for H+ ions were observed in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte when compared to those of pure water (4.3 ppm) and concentrated H2SO4 (10.8 ppm), respectively. These results imply that H+ ions in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte are surrounded by coordinated water molecules with the existence of hydronium ions. Due to the generation of anionic vacancies on the surface of NiCo2A4, the shackles of hydronium ions are significantly weakened with more exposed H+ ions adsorbed near the vacancy-enriched domains. It can be concluded that the four reaction steps of the HER process on the surface of VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs catalyst can be summarized as shown in Fig. 4g, which includes adsorption of hydronium ions (step i), the capture of H+ from hydronium ions and the adsorption of H+ (steps ii and iii), and finally desorption of H2 (step iv). Based on the structural analysis and theoretical calculations, the superior electrocatalytic performance of the VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs could be attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, attributing to the anionic substitution by using homogeneous elements with larger atomic radius (O < S < Se), NiCo2Se4 possesses a better conductivity compared to both of NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4. Secondly, the group VI anionic vacancy significantly weakens the shackles of H+ from hydronium ions, which promotes the adsorption of H+ and thus facilitates the HER process. Finally, the synergistic effect of anionic vacancy and 3D networks of nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers enhance the conductivity, so promoting the supply of electrons from the inner carbon support to the adsorbed H+ ions on the surface."
11,Conclusions,"In conclusion, a series of anionic vacancy-rich NiCo2A4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs, A = O, S, Se) have been successfully fabricated by combining a hydrothermal approach and controlled annealing treatment. The electrochemical HER test results and density functional theory calculations consistently confirm that VA-NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalysts display higher electrocatalytic activity than the corresponding vacancy-free NiCo2A4-NWs/NCNFs. This is because the anionic vacancy in VA-NiCo2A4 is beneficial to weakening the shackles of hydronium ions, and thus will enhance the H+ capture for accelerated HER processes. For example, the as-obtained VSe–NiCo2Se4-NWs/NCNFs electrocatalyst shows an optimized overpotential of 168 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a low Tafel slope of 49.8 mV dec−1, and excellent long-term durability in acid media. Therefore, this work not only discloses the correlation between anionic vacancy engineering and intrinsic HER catalytic activity for multi-transition metal based HER electrocatalyst, but also provides novel insights to design electrocatalysts with outstanding durability and high efficiency."
