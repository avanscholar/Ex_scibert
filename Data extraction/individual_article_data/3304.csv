0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production by electrocatalytic water splitting is a significant approach to alleviate increasingly serious energy crises and environmental pollution [1–3]. As one of the half-reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), particularly in alkaline, requires advanced electrocatalysts to reduce the energy barrier efficiently [4–6]. Even though Pt-based materials are the state-of-the-art catalysts for HER by far, they are still considerably hampered by the low reserves and high costs [7,8]. Therefore, it is imperative to develop earth-abundant and cost-effective catalysts with high-current density for large-scale applications [9]. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been regarded as highly expected candidates for HER due to favorable properties and suitable hydrogen adsorption [10,11]. Attractive catalysts are bimetallic Ni-Co phosphides where the kinetic energy barriers are lowered in different metal 3d orbitals [12]. As a result, the bimetallic sites and P atoms are demonstrated to function as a good hydride acceptor and proton trap to promote the HER process in alkaline solution [13]. However, owing to the high stoichiometric ratio of metal/phosphorous and the limitation of electronic structure tuning among binary metals, the HER performance can be detrimentally influenced [10,14]. To endow the TMPs with required electron transfer capability and hydrogen adsorption and desorption energy, various strategies have been proposed, mainly including heteroatom doping [15–17], interface engineering [9,18], phase modification [19–21], strain construction [22]. Among them, heteroatom doping, particularly cations, has attracted much attention because of its simplicity and diversity. Especially for early transition metals with relatively large atomic radius and stable high valence state, such as Mo, V [23–28]. When they are incorporated as guests, the electronic structure of the initial compound can be efficiently tuned, thus conducive to electron density distribution on surface. For instance, Li et al. prepared Mo-doped Ni2P nanoneedles on Ni foam and the synergistic effect between Mo and Ni accounts for the enhanced HER activity [25]. Yang’s group found a neighboring effect induced by V doping in FeCoP nanoarrays, which confers Pt-like HER performance to the resulting catalyst [26]. Whereas, the implementation of early transition metal doping via common methods including hydrothermal [29,30] and sol–gel method [31] are cumbersome and time-consuming and cannot reach the expected activity. Moreover, the preparation of high-performance catalysts requires deliberate tuning for nucleation and growth processes to effectively control composition, shape and size [32]. At present, it is still challenging to tune all the fabrication parameters, such as temperature, concentration and time, to obtain the desired catalysts. Therefore, a mild element doping method is extremely required to retain the morphologies of precursors. Ion-exchange (IE) reactions have occurred as a powerful and convenient way to scientifically tailor the composition while keeping the size and shape of the template unchanged [33,34]. Most importantly, the preferential sites for IE including defects, low-coordinated surfaces, are equally conducive to HER can be well retained [33,35]. Such intriguing property makes IE an attractive way to adjust the atomic/electronic structure of electrocatalysts. Qiao et al. prepared Ni and Zn co-doped CoO nanoneedle arrays on conductive substrates by gas-phase IE method, and the activity of obtained nanoneedle arrays exceeded Pt/C at high current density [36]. Wu et al. constructed FeCoNi layered double hydroxide-supported single Ru atoms (Ru SAs/AC-FeCoNi) through the in-situ IE process by replacing Ru in AC-FeCoNi with Ru species, which exhibited high catalytic activity due to the unique heterostructure [37]. In this respect, substituting ions in parent materials with ion guests endows the resulting composites with exquisite modulation for electronic structure. Hence, introducing early transition metals like Mo and V via IE method to the TMPs for better electron transfer capability and hydrogen adsorption and desorption energy is meaningful and deserves elaborate research for HER performance improvement. In addition, parallel to intrinsic activity, structure design, such as nanoneedle, nanoflower and nanorod, to increase the number of active sites is another strategy to boost catalytic activity [38]. Considering the unique length-diameter ratio of nanoneedle structure may lead to a large surface area, therefore, taking it as the template of IE may conduce to the synthesis of high-performance HER catalysts. Herein, Mo/V has been successfully incorporated into NiCo precursor via a versatile IE method. Firstly, the nanoneedle-like NiCo precursor is synthesized via molten salt decomposition (MSDS) root, ensuring high dispersion of catalyst and its strong cohesion with the substrate. Secondly, an appropriate amount of Mo/V is doped into NiCo precursor by a short-time IE method and gas-phase phosphating with nanostructure well maintained, resulting in the fine-tuning of surface electron structure. The final Mo/V-NiCoP/NF shows excellent HER performance and long-term stability. Mo-NiCoP/NF requires overpotentials as small as 84 mV and 144 mV to obtain current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Excellent HER performance exceeding Pt/C at high current (>99 mA cm−2) can be attributed to the optimized electron structure and large active surface area. And the long-term stability of 20 h benefits from stable morphology. This work verifies the availability of the IE method for the production of high-performance catalysts and provides an avenue to design catalysts."

It includes the as-prepared sample as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a graphite rod as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The potentials described during this work were normalized versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), according to the following equation: E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.243 + 0.059 pH. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests for the HER were carried out in 1.0 M KOH (pH = 14) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were tested at −0.08 V (vs. RHE) for the HER, with the frequency ranging from 105 to 0.1 Hz at an AC voltage of 5 mV. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were obtained at sweep rates of 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mV s−1. Electrical double-layer capacitance (C dl) data obtained from the CV of each Δj = (janode - jcathode) / 2 at 0.05 V vs RHE. The stabilities of the samples were measured by CV (in a potential range from 0.07 to 0.02 V vs RHE) and chronoamperometry. The polarization curve data was obtained under iR (current time internal resistance) correction using GAMRY Framework Data Acquisition Software 6.11."
8,Results and discussion,"The preparation of Mo-NiCoP/NF is schematically demonstrated in Fig. 1 . NF is selected as a supporting substrate because of its 3D porous structure and excellent electrical conductivity. Initially, CoNi(NO) x (OH) y nanoarrays were grown in situ on nickel foam by the MSDS method, which ensures abundant active sites and attachment for Mo/V doping. Afterward, the final Mo/V-NiCoP/NF was fabricated by a versatile ion-exchange root followed by gas-phase phosphating. It is noteworthy that the resulting Mo-NiCoP/NF is selected as representative for the following discussion. First, the phases and structure information of catalysts are investigated by XRD. Due to the strong peaks of the Ni (PDF No. 00-003-1051, marked as asterisk), the typical peaks of electrocatalysts grown on NF are weak. The XRD patterns (Fig. 2 a) of the Mo-NiCoP/NF and NiCoP/NF are relatively consistent. The typical peaks emerge at 41.06°, 44.9°, 47.68°, 54.50° and 75.32° corresponding to (111), (201), (210), (300), and (212) plane of NiCoP (PDF No. 01-100-8057), respectively. To reduce the influence of nickel skeleton, the samples are scratched off the NFs. It is found that there still exist no obvious typical peaks of Mo, Co x P y or Ni x P y species ( Fig. S2 a), revealing that these species may exist in the form of amorphous structure. After the doping of guest elements, the typical peaks of NiCoP shift to the left around 0.1° ( Fig. S2 b), demonstrating the Mo element may have been successfully doped into it. XPS is further carried out to analyze the chemical states of the main elements of Mo-NiCoP/NF and NiCoP/NF. For NiCoP/NF, high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co species ( Fig. S1 a) is comprised of Co-P bonds (at 797.1 and 778.2 eV) and cobalt oxides (at 781.8 eV) [38,40]. The Ni 2p spectrum ( Fig. S1 b) exhibits 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2, located at respectively 853.0 and 870.1 eV, which can be assigned to Ni-P bonds, and peaks located at 874.1 and 856.7 eV imply the presence of nickel oxides species [41]. In the P 2p spectrum ( Fig. S1 c), a large peak of the PO bond at 134.2 eV illustrates partial oxidation of P in the air [42]. The peaks of the metal-P bond can be detected at 130.2 and 129.3 eV [43]. The survey spectrum (Fig. 2 b) illustrates the Mo-NiCoP/NF contains Mo, Ni, Co, P, N, C and O elements. The nitrogen comes from the nitrate residue of the precursor, and oxygen comes from nitrate and partial oxidation. However, in the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( Fig. S4 ), N cannot be detected. The lower detection limit of XPS makes N elements can be seen. During the phosphating process, the high temperature leads to nitrate with nickel and cobalt as cationic decomposing into gas. The residual trace nitrogen after decomposition may hardly have an impact on the catalytic performance. The detection of the C element suggests the contamination of carbon species during the characterization. The XPS patterns of Co, Ni, P in Mo-NiCoP/NF are relatively consistent with those in NiCoP/NF. For Mo-NiCoP/NF. The Co 2p region (Fig. 2 c) shows the Co-P bonds (at 797.8 and 778.4 eV) and cobalt oxides (at 781.9 eV). The Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2 d) indicates the formation of Ni-P bonds (853.1 and 870.4 eV) and nickel oxides (860.2 and 874.6 eV). In the P 2p region (Fig. 2 e), the peaks of PO (at 134.2 eV) and metal-P (at 130.1 and 129.4 eV) can also be detected, which confirms the formation of bimetallic Ni-Co phosphides. Besides, peaks at 236.5, 233.3 eV and 230.6 eV corresponding to the MoO3 and MoO2 are observed [44,45]. As far as we know, MoO3 does not have special properties in the field of energy transformation and storage. Hence it may have no discernible effect on materials. For MOO2, previous researches have suggested MoO2 may also play a role in promoting the regulation of electronic structure [46,47]. Noting that there is no obvious typical peak implying the presence of Mo-P bond because the formation of Mo-P bond often requires relatively harsh reaction conditions [48–50]. The above data illustrate that the incorporation of Mo can cause the peaks to shift in Co 2p and Ni 2p regions ( Fig. S1 d-e), showing the transfer of electrons between metals, which further affects the catalytic performance. The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. S3 a-c, nickel foam presents a three-dimensional skeleton structure with a smooth surface. After 20 h of reacting in molten salt, Fig. S3 d-f shows that the NF was anchored by CoNi(NO) x (OH) y nanoneedles with lengths of several microns ranging from 500 nm to 3 μm in diameter, which is corresponding to the previous report [39]. For NiCoP/NF, after phosphating, the SEM images in Fig. S3 g-i manifest that phosphating will not make the sample’s structure collapse meanwhile the surface becomes slightly rougher. SEM images of Mo-NiCoP/NF (Fig. 3 a-b) show that the doping of Mo has no obvious effect on micromorphology. The nanoneedle structure of Mo-NiCoP/NF with a diameter of around 320 nm was further convinced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3 c). To illustrate the element distribution, EDX was carried out under TEM. Elemental mapping (Fig. 3 e-f) suggests the homogeneous distribution of Ni, Co, Mo, and P elements in a single nanoneedle of Mo-NiCoP/NF. And the EDX spectra ( Fig. S4 ) reveals that the content of the Mo element is 4.16 wt%, suggesting a low doping degree. The lattice structure of Mo-NiCoP/NF scraped from NF was then collected by High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. 3 d shows three distinct lattice fringes of 0.220, 0.202 and 0.168 nm, corresponding to the (111), (201) and (300) plane of NiCoP, respectively. Combined with the previous XRD results, the detected structure indicates the successful doping of Mo and the existence of NiCoP crystal structure on the sample surface. The HER performance of as-synthesized Mo-NiCoP/NF was then evaluated in 1 M KOH. For comparison, the catalytic activities of NiCoP/NF, Mo-NiCo precursor, NiCo precursor, Pt/C and NF were also measured under the same conditions. LSV polarization curves (Fig. 4 a) and the related current density comparison (Fig. 4 b) show that NF exhibits poor properties requiring an overpotential of 407.2 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm−2. After the doping of Co and Mo, the NiCo precursor and Mo-NiCo precursor require 317.3 mV and 287.9 mV respectively to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm−2. The improvement in performance maybe because of the nanoneedle structure which facilitates the specific surface areas and fast gas bubble release. After phosphating, the overpotential of NiCoP/NF and Mo-NiCoP/NF at 100 mA cm−2 is 184.1 mV and 144.4 mV, respectively. The Pt/C catalyst, as expected, shows excellent HER performance with a near-zero onset potential. Nevertheless, in the alkaline environment, H produced by H2O could not be absorbed efficiently, leading to the limited catalytic activity of Pt/C at a large current density. For Mo-NiCoP/NF, previous researches have suggested that the desorption of OH– takes place on the Ni site, whereas the Co site helps in H2 generation and release [51,52]. The synergistic effect of Ni and Co, coupled with the effect of Mo on the electronic structure, leads to its activity exceeding Pt/C at the current density of 99 mA cm−2. The enhancement of HER properties after Mo doping indicates that Mo dopants may optimize the electronic structure of catalytic sites and increase the electrochemically active areas. Moreover, the influence of Mo doping amount on the HER catalytic performance of the sample is also tested ( Fig. S5 a). Fig. 4 c shows the corresponding Tafel plots, which are related to HER kinetics. The Tafel slope generated by Mo-NiCoP/NF (56.6 mV dec-1) is lower than that of NiCoP/NF (68.2 mV dec-1), Mo-NiCo precursor (114.7 mV dec-1), NiCo precursor (128.9 mV dec-1) and NF (117.1 mV dec-1), indicating that Mo-NiCoP/NF in alkaline medium has a more efficient Volmer-Heyrovsky process. Combined with the previous XPS results, it illustrates that the change of electronic structure caused by Mo doping can effectively promote the Volmer-Heyrovsky process and decrease the Tafel slope, so that promotes hydrogen evolution reaction. The excellent activity of Mo-NiCoP/NF is comparable to that of other nickel–cobalt-based catalysts in recent studies (Table S1). Moreover, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst was calculated by CV. The CV curves of the as-prepared samples are measured in the potential range of 0.02 to 0.07 V (vs. RHE) at the scan range from 40 to 120 mV s−1. The ECSA can then be evaluated by calculating the C dl from the CV curve at 0.05 V ( Fig. S5 b-f). Fig. 4 d shows that compared with NF (1.8 mF cm−2), NiCo precursor (2.0 mF cm−2), Mo-NiCo precursor (8.1 mF cm−2) and NiCoP/NF (27.9 mF cm−2), Mo-NiCoP/NF (67.2 mF cm−2) has a larger C dl value, indicating that Mo-NiCoP/NF has the largest electrochemical active areas, which is corresponding to its optimal HER performance. It can be seen that after Mo doping, Mo-NiCoP/NF has much higher ECSA than NiCoP/NF, indicating that besides regulating electronic structure, Mo dopants can also promote hydrogen evolution reaction through facilitating abundant active sites exposure. The results of the EIS of each sample (Fig. 4 e) are used to further compare HER performance. The Rct of Mo-NiCoP/NF is 3 Ω, which is lower than those of NiCoP/NF (7 Ω), Mo-NiCo precursor (10 Ω) and NiCo precursor (12 Ω), further demonstrating that Mo-NiCoP/NF has a faster electron transfer. The electrochemical stability of each final sample was also measured. Fig. S6 shows that after Mo doping, Mo-NiCoP/NF owns significantly better stability than NiCoP/NF. Compared with the obvious decrease of NiCoP/NF after 1000 CV, Mo-NiCoP/NF does not exhibit degradation but a good enhancement to a certain extent after 5000 CV, which may be due to the continuous redox process on the catalyst surface exposing more active sites. The improvement of the stability of Mo doped samples can also be demonstrated by chronoamperometry. After a long time of reaction, the current density of NiCoP/NF decreased over 60%, while that of Mo-NiCoP/NF remained basically unchanged. In addition, the SEM images ( Fig. S7 ) of Mo-NiCoP/NF after stability tests show the nanoneedles are well retained, while the corresponding XRD data ( Fig. S8 ) also manifest the unchanged NiCoP structure, again indicating good stability. According to the previous XRD and C dl data, the stability enhancement may be due to the significant influence of Mo on the crystal structure of NiCoP, which makes it exist in a more stable form [23,24]. The long-term stability also benefits from the intrinsic robustness and strengthened adhesion to the conductive substrate. Furthermore, in order to verify the effectiveness of the ion-exchange strategy, we changed the dopant from Mo to V in a similarly experimental process. The XRD pattern ( Fig. S9 a) shows that except for the strong peaks of Ni, the typical peaks of V-NiCoP/NF are not obvious, while typical peaks of NiCoP can still be distinguished. The typical peaks of NiCoP also show a small shift in V-NiCoP/NF ( Fig. S10 ), indicating the V atoms are successfully doped into the NiCoP crystal lattices. SEM was carried out to investigate the micromorphology of V-NiCoP/NF. Fig. 5 a-b shows that the doping of V has no great effect on the original morphology. Elemental mapping images ( Fig. S9 b-f) confirm the homogeneous distribution of Ni, Co, V, and P elements in nanoneedles of V-NiCoP/NF, illustrating that V can be doped through the IE strategy like Mo. The HER activity of the V-NiCoP/NF sample was investigated in the same situation, and the results showed that the doping of V could also improve the catalytic performance (Fig. 5 c). The overpotential of V-NiCoP/NF at 10 and 100 mA cm−2 is 84 and 156 mV, respectively. LSV curves before and after 2000 CV in Fig. 5 d show that the doping of V also exhibits admirable stability. Fig. S9 a shows that after doping of V, the typical peaks of NiCoP become relatively weak. It means V can effectively reduce the crystal structure of NiCoP, resulting in more defects. Thus V-NiCoP/NF has weaker stability than Mo-NiCoP/NF. To further investigate the difference in the effect of Mo and V for NiCoP/NF on the hydrogen evolution reaction, the Tafel slope, ECSA and EIS data of V-NiCoP/NF were collected through the same method. Fig. S11 a shows the Tafel plots corresponding to Fig. 5 c. Unlike the doping of Mo, the doping of V does not decrease the Tafel slope of V-NiCoP/NF. The Tafel slope of V-NiCoP/NF is 68.1 mV dec-1, which is so close to NiCoP/NF (68.2 mV dec-1), meaning that V cannot influence the hydrogen evolution reaction through accelerating the Volmer or Heyrovsky step. It may result from the poor or unsatisfactory effect of V dopants on the electronic structure of the sample. The function of V is further explained through ECSA. Fig. S11 d shows that compared with NiCoP/NF (27.9 mF cm−2), V-NiCoP/NF (51.7 mF cm−2) has a larger C dl value, indicating that V-NiCoP/NF has more electrochemical active sites than NiCoP/NF, which is the same as the result of Mo doping. The Rct of V-NiCoP in EIS ( Fig. S11 b) is 5 Ω, which is corresponding to its optimal HER performance. Moreover, we normalized the LSV polarization curves with ECSA, as shown in Fig. S12 , indicating the preferable catalytic performance on Mo-NiCoP/NF and confirming that the intrinsic activity was improved due to the Mo doping. Combined with XPS data, the improvement of intrinsic activity can be attributed to the effect of Mo on the electronic structure. Compared with the doping of Mo, after the normalization with ECSA, the LSV polarization curve of V-NiCoP/NF tends to be consistent with that of NiCoP/NF, which is corresponding to the previous analysis. The above data imply the doping of V or Mo has certain differences in promoting the hydrogen evolution reaction of NiCoP/NF. Both of them have significant effects on the structure, resulting in exposing quantities of active sites and promoting the reaction activity. However, Mo can further promote intrinsic activity by regulating the electronic structure of NiCoP. Therefore, Mo-NiCoP/NF has the best catalytic performance."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, we designed the NiCoP nanoneedles doped with Mo/V species on Ni foam to facilitate the alkaline HER process. A very facile MSDS root coupled with the IE strategy enables the evenly doping of Mo and V in nanoneedle arrays under extremely mild conditions. The electrochemical characterization verifies Mo dopants have a better electronic regulation effect on NiCoP crystal than V dopants, which enhances the intrinsic activity of Mo-NiCoP/NF, leading to the higher performance than noble metal Pt/C at the large current density. This IE strategy is far more facile and controllable compared with many previous works [17,23,24]. The present work may open new sights for employing molten salt decomposition and ion-exchange strategy to develop cost-effective HER electrocatalysis as well as other renewable energy conversion and storage systems."
