0,Introduction,"A sustainable energy vision of our future focuses on the need of a secure energy supply, including the use of renewable resources as well as the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions [1,2]. In this respect, hydrogen is supposed to play an important role as an alternative fuel and energy carrier due to its high gravimetric energy storage capacity [3]. Its relevance has increased over the last years due to considerable advances in hydrogen production, storage and conversion [4–6]. In particular, hydrogen can be obtained by light driven reduction of protons from water, which is subject of intense research [7]. Despite significant efforts to date, the present challenge in materials chemistry is to develop highly active photocatalysts [8,9]. However, the search for photocatalyst materials is more and more directed towards the combination of single components in order to obtain multifunctional materials. Thus, beside photocatalyst synthesis the mixing with other activity enhancing materials plays a significant role in light-driven photocatalytic water splitting and photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation [10–12]. Recently we showed the influence of particle size of gold decorated NaTaO3 semiconductors on the photocatalytic water splitting in solution mixture with conducting multilayer reduced graphene oxide (m-rGO) [13]. Although the catalytic performance was significantly increased in the case of nanoscale NaTaO3, the interactions between the multilayer graphene oxide and the catalyst are rather random since no chemical or physical attachment of the components was achieved. Aerogels are a class of highly porous materials that combine unique properties like high specific surface area, low density and low thermal conductivity in a continuous 3D network of meso- to micropores which makes them attractive for photocatalytic applications [14–16]. Gathering in this manner, all the desired properties for a physical composite architecture, like high surface area, photoactivation of the semiconductor, a co-catalyst and conducting carbon platelets could be brought together. In this context, the multicomponent aerogel strategy reported by Niederberger et al. provides a good approach to physically combine several different materials into one single architecture on the base of a TiO2 model system [17,18]. This work reports on such an assembly of multicomponent aerogels and their application in photocatalytic H2 production. The catalysts consist of chemically synthesized conductive carbon layers (m-rGO) and chemically synthesized platinum nanoparticles embedded in a porous semiconductor TiO2 anatase matrix. Upon combination of catalytic active and conducting components in aerogels an increase in photocatalytic activity was found for such catalyst architectures."
1,Materials and methods,"Multicomponent aerogels were prepared by the following materials and techniques, which can be summarized by Scheme 1 . In details: (i) chemical synthesis of trizma-functionalized TiO2 anatase; (ii) synthesis of metallic nanoparticles free of surface ligands or stabilizers; (iii) preparation of multilayer graphene oxide and further reduction by a solvothermal treatment to m-rGO; (iv) mixing the previously prepared materials to prepare one single dispersion; (v) gelation of the mixed dispersion and (vi) solvent exchange and supercritical drying of the samples. Aerogel derived catalysts are abbreviated according to the following nomenclature: “Pt/Xm-rGO/TiO2 aerogel” with 0.4wt% Pt and X: wt% m-rGO, both related to the overall mass in the TiO2 aerogel network (for details, see Table 2). Furthermore, variations in Pt content revealed catalysts named “1.0Pt/0m-rGO/TiO2 aerogel” with 1.0wt% Pt and “0.1Pt/0m-rGO/TiO2 aerogel” with 0.1wt% Pt, respectively. Reference catalysts are denoted as “mixture Pt/Xm-rGO/TiO2”."
2,Materials and syntheses,"2.1 Materials and syntheses Titanium(IV) chloride (>99.0%), benzyl alcohol (≥99.0%) and chloroform (≥99.8%) were purchased from Merck. 2-Amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (trizma ≥99.7%) and graphite powder (<20μm) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF 99.8%) were purchased from Acros and ethanol (≥99.5%), sulphuric acid (H2SO4 96%) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4 ≥99.%) were purchased from Carl Roth. Chloroplatinic acid was isolated after treatment in aqua regia using pure platinum metal >99.99% as precursor. All gases used during the experiments were purchased from Linde and/or Air Liquide. Only deionized water (DI) was used throughout the experiments. All chemicals were used as received. (i) Synthesis of trizma-functionalized TiO 2 was adapted from a published synthesis protocol [17]. 6.49mmol (786mg) 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (trizma), was dissolved in 170ml benzyl alcohol by heating to 80°C for 30min. After cooling to room temperature 77.52mmol (8.5ml) TiCl4 was added dropwise under stirring. The reaction solution was heated to 80°C for 24h. Afterwards, the solution was cooled to room temperature and the resulting material were separated from the solvent by centrifugation. The yellowish supernatant was decanted; the white precipitate was washed with chloroform by re-dispersing the precipitate. The washing step was repeated at least three times with chloroform followed by centrifugation. The wet precipitate was dried in oven under vacuum (60°C, 12h), grinded and finally redispersed in water. The final concentration of trizma functionalized anatase nanoparticles was 120mg/ml. (ii) Synthesis of the platinum nanoparticles: 179mg HPtCl6 were dissolved in 60ml DMF and stirred for 15min at room temperature. Aliquots of 30ml were poured into 50ml Teflon vessels, sealed and heated in a CEM Mars laboratory microwave for 30s at 220°C with a maximum power of 600W. The resulting nanoparticle dispersion was used without further treatment. The final solution concentration of 0.94mg/ml was determined using induced coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP). (iii) Synthesis of multilayer reduced graphene oxide (m-rGO): First graphite powder was exfoliated and oxidized using a modified Hummer's method [19,20]. In detail, 5.0g graphite and 2.5g NaNO3 were added to 120ml concentrated H2SO4 and the mixture was cooled to 0°C. KMnO4 (15.0g) was added slowly under stirring in order to keep the reaction below 30°C. Afterwards, the slurry was stirred at 35°C for 0.5h and then 230ml water were added slowly in order to keep the reaction temperature around 98°C for 15min. The suspension was quenched by adding 700ml of water and the remaining unreacted KMnO4 was consumed by adding 12ml of H2O2 (30%). After cooling to room temperature the black slurry was purified as follows. The filtrate was centrifuged (4000rpm for 1h) and its supernatant decanted away. The remaining solid was washed extensively with water, two times with HCl (30%) solution and with ethanol afterwards and with acetone finally. For every washing cycle centrifugation was used to collect the precipitate (4000rpm/15min) except for the washing with ethanol and acetone (10,000rpm/0.5h). The final obtained brown solid precipitate was dried overnight at 40°C. For the reduction step, 1.0g of the dried material was dispersed into 100ml of 99.5% ethanol and sonicated for 0.5h prior to pour the solution into a Teflon autoclave and submit it to solvothermal treatment at 150°C for 24h. (iv) Pre-mixing of nanoparticle dispersions for aerogel preparation: For the preparation of a mixture of Pt and TiO2 nanoparticles, the aqueous TiO2 anatase dispersion is mixed with the platinum dispersion in DMF in a volume ratio of 2:1. For dispersions containing m-rGO, the proportional amount of m-rGO powder is dispersed in the as-synthesized platinum colloid dispersion and sonicated for 30min. Then, the TiO2 dispersion is added in a volume ratio of 2:1. For the preparation of dispersions without platinum, the pure DMF is used instead. (v) Preparation of (mixture Pt/Xm-rGO/TiO 2 ) reference samples: For the particle mixture the same procedure was performed as described above (item iv). The as prepared mixed dispersions were stirred and afterwards sonicated for 10min and dried in vacuum overnight at 60°C. A fine powder was obtained after grinding the dry product. (vi) Gelation of the nanoparticle dispersions (Pt/Xm-rGO/TiO 2 ): After pouring the dispersions in a Teflon container, the container is sealed and the gelation is induced by heating the containers to 90°C for 30min in an oven. The final gels can be removed from the container after cooling to room temperature. (vii) Supercritical drying: The DMF-water pore liquid of the gels is stepwise exchanged to acetone, in steps of: 30vol% for 1h, 50vol% 1h, 75vol% 1h, 90vol% 1h, 100vol% 1h and 100vol% 12h. CO2 supercritical drying was performed with a Leica CPD 030 or Emitech K850. The gels obtained can be stored in acetone or can be immediately transferred in the CO2 supercritical dry equipment chamber. At first the chamber was pre-cooled to 5°C and purged with CO2. Then the sample was left to soak in CO2 for 30min and after this period the gas was released and another purging step was repeated (in general this procedure was performed 3× or until checking with filter paper at outlet of exhaust of the equipment for damp patch indicating solvent exchange conditions). After the solvent exchange was completed the heating was turned on until 40°C were reached and the pressure in the chamber reached nearly 80bar. Normally the supercritical drying conditions is achieved around 31°C and 74bar."
3,Characterization methods,"2.2 Characterization methods 2.2.1 Materials characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a STADI P automated transmission diffractometer from STOE (Darmstadt, Germany) with an incident beam curved germanium monochromator selecting CuKα1 radiation (l=1.5406Å, 40kV, 40mA) and a 6° linear position sensitive detector (PSD). The alignment was checked by use of a silicon standard. The data were collected in the 2θ range from 5° to 60° with a step size of 0.5° and a measurement time of 50s per step. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution were determined on a Quantachrome Nova 4200 or Quantachrome autosorb IQ instruments with nitrogen as the sorption gas. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed at 200kV on a JEM-ARM200F instrument (JEOL, Japan), aberration-corrected by a CESCOR (CEOS) for STEM applications. The samples were prepared by adding the solid grinded aerogels directly on a holey carbon-supported grid (mesh 300) and transferred to the instrument. The measurement for image S4 were performed on a Philips Tecnai F30 operated at 300kV. For sample preparation the platinum nanoparticles in DMF were dropped as synthesized on a carbon coated copper grid on a filter paper to absorb excess liquid and dried at 60°C. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed with a Malvern Instrument Zetasizer 3000HSA equipped with a He–Ne laser (λ =633nm, max 5mW) and operated at a scattering angle of 90°. In all measurements, 1ml of suspensions was employed and placed in a 10mm×10mm quartz cuvette at 25°C. Samples were prepared in the same way as prepared for the photocatalysis experiments. UV–vis spectra were recorded with an AvaSpec 2048 fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes B.V., Netherlands) equipped with an AvaLight-DHS light source and a FCR-7UV200-2-45-ME 45° reflection probe using barium sulphate as reference. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a Varian 715-ES ICP-emission spectrometer was carried out, in order to quantify the amount of platinum in the aerogel samples. 2.2.2 Photocatalytic measurements All catalytic experiments were carried out under argon atmosphere with freshly distilled solvents. In a standard reaction a double-walled and thermostatically controlled (25°C) reaction vessel was connected to an automatic gas burette and several times flushed with argon. Then, the solid catalyst sample (25mg) was introduced in a Teflon crucible, followed by the addition of methanol and water (10ml MeOH/H2O in the volume ratio of 1/1). The photocatalytic reaction was started by irradiating the stirred (300rpm) reaction mixture with light (Hg-light source, Lumatec Superlite 400, equipped with a 320–500nm filter, 7.2W output). The gas evolution was quantitatively measured by means of an automatic gas burette every 30s, while the gas composition was further analysed by GC (HP 6890N, carboxen 1000, TCD detector). Further details on the equipment and experimental setup have been published previously [21]."
4,Results and discussion,"Usually aerogel preparation is reported using amorphous precursors followed by further calcination to obtain the desired crystalline phase [15,22–25]. In our work, as shown in Scheme 1, it is possible to produce gels with different preformed nanocrystalline components by simply mixing and co-gelating without further calcination. Present temperature sensitive carbonaceous materials such as m-rGO and the mesoporous structure are preserved in this way (Fig. 1 ). N2 physisorption measurements performed on such TiO2-aerogels presented high surface areas of about 500m2 g−1 and pore sizes at around 17nm with narrow pore size distribution. The obtained BET surface area indicates that the aerogel architecture doubled the surface area in comparison to trizma-functionalized TiO2 powder (252m2 g−1), while Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and m-rGO loading slightly decrease the surface area (Table 1 ). It was reported by some previous methods that the loading of noble metals significantly reduced the pore size distribution [16,24]. However, in our work the BJH pore size distribution indicates that the loading of Pt NPs or m-rGO sheets do not affect the pore size distribution (Fig. 1) confirming the advantage of the here presented method for aerogel preparation. The XRD patterns of the TiO2 trizma functionalized powder and other representative aerogel compositions are shown in Fig. 2 . All materials have nearly identical diffraction patterns and were indexed to the anatase phase (PDF 21-1272), indicating that the incorporation of Pt nanoparticles or carbon material (m-rGO) does not affect the TiO2 crystallinity. Reflections from platinum or m-rGO were not observed due to the low loading content in the Pt/0m-rGO/TiO2 and Pt/1.0m-rGO/TiO2 aerogels, respectively. In addition, the reflection peak intensity for m-rGO is 100 times lower in comparison to the TiO2 reflections (Fig. S1). An average crystallite size of 5nm was determined by using the Scherrer's equation fitting the (101) peak for all measured diffraction patterns indicating that the loadings of Pt NPs or m-rGO do not affect the TiO2 particle size. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images give an overview of the Pt/0m-rGO/TiO2 and Pt/1.0m-rGO/TiO2 aerogels samples showing a continuous TiO2 network with multidirectional junctions that lead to the porous structure comprised of particle sizes not larger than 3nm, decorated with quasi-spherical Pt NPs in the range of 1–2nm (Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively). Fig. 3a shows platinum as black dots dispersed over the TiO2 network while in Fig. 3b the HAADF-STEM image reveals the Pt particles as white spots. More details can be observed by HRTEM image in Fig. 3c. Appearing lattice planes for TiO2 and Pt particles further confirm their crystalline structure. Due to the HAADF-STEM contrast (Fig. 3d) it is possible to distinguish between platinum and TiO2 particles, where the grey and black regions are composed by anatase, while the white quasi-spherical particles are composed of platinum with maximum 2nm in diameter. Although, the aerogel composition changed to Pt/1.0m-rGO/TiO2 by the addition of 1wt% m-rGO, it is still possible to observe similar structure features as mentioned for the Pt/0m-rGO/TiO2 aerogel as shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a and b is shown the overview of the Pt/1.0m-rGO/TiO2 with the characteristic multidirectional network uniformly decorated with Pt NPs. HRTEM bright field image (Fig. 4c) reveals the particles dimensions around 3nm for titanium oxide (light grey) while 1–2nm for Pt nanoparticles (dark quasi-spherical regions). In the HAADF (Fig. 4d) one can clearly distinguish between the Pt and titanium oxide NPs. TEM measurements were also performed for the single components such as m-rGO (Fig. S3a), platinum nanoparticles (Fig. S4) and the pure TiO2 aerogel, in order to establish control over the materials as single or as a multicomponent system (Fig. S6). TEM on pure m-rGO shows carbon sheets with sizes above 1 micron with approximately a 20 layers stack (Fig. S3b and S3c). Due to the higher particle size m-rGO in multicomponent aerogels can be visualized on the outer surface of fractures (Fig. S5). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) investigations were conducted to obtain the size distribution and stability of the aerogels structure when poured into the water/methanol mixture. Fig. 5 indicates a broad monomodal distribution with mean size around 630nm for the former pure TiO2 aerogel and nearly 400nm for Pt/0m-rGO/TiO2 and Pt/1.0m-rGO/TiO2 aerogels. These results indicate the hydrodynamic aerogel size in liquid media. While the macrostructure of the monolith is lost during the “dissolution” process the microstructure is still preserved by the well-interconnected TiO2 network, shown in Figs. 3a and b and 4a and b. Fig. 6a shows the photocatalytic H2 generation of various materials including the pure TiO2 aerogel (C), and the samples “mixture Pt/0m-rGO/TiO2” (A) and “mixture Pt/10m-rGO/TiO2” (B) used as references for comparison. TiO2 aerogel alone (C) showed only poor photocatalytic activity due to rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. However, if additives are introduced such as co-catalyst or co-catalyst and m-rGO we observed photocatalytic activities higher than for the reference samples (A and B) in Fig. 6a. A significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen generation was achieved when applying the aerogel containing material (I) (Pt/0m-rGO/TiO2). With the latter sample a 3.5-fold activity was obtained compared to the reference powder of same composition (A), and even 67-fold improvement compared to the TiO2 aerogel (C), Fig.S7. As the comparison shows, this activity increase is to a significant part arising from the aerogel architecture and not only by the crystal structure or simply mixing the single components. The aerogel prevents particles from aggregation and offers a better distribution of additives. The activity of sample (D) is slightly enhanced compared to sample (C) because the electrical conductive m-rGO acts as cocatalyst as previously reported [13]. Further, a detailed study of the influence of m-rGO loading on the multicomponent aerogel has been performed (Fig. 6b) at an optimum Pt loading of 0.4wt% (Fig. S8). Depending on the m-rGO concentration different photocatalytic H2 generation activities were observed. The maximum activities were achieved with samples containing 0.1wt% and 10wt% m-rGO (H and E). However, still sample (I), containing no m-rGO, showed almost 2-fold activity. This fact is not consistent with previous reports from Meyer et al. [13], Kim et al. [26], and Yeh et al. [27] for instance. All aforementioned groups observed the increase of H2 production after addition of reduced graphene oxide. The apparent drop in photocatalytic H2 generation between samples (I and G) can be ascribed as follows. The very well dispersion of TiO2 and Pt nanoparticles in the aerogel results in higher direct surface contact between both components while the m-rGO sheets are in poor contact with the Pt/TiO2 domains as depicted in Fig. S5. The poor contact of Pt on m-rGO with TiO2 results in less accessible Pt species. As a consequence, the TiO2 photogenerated conduction band electrons can reach the Pt surface easier in sample (I) contributing to an enhancement of the hydrogen photocatalytic activity. Contrary, in samples (E)–(H) the lack of surface contact between the TiO2 network and m-rGO favours the charge recombination and therewith reduces the photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity."
5,Conclusions,"Multicomponent photocatalysts were prepared by the assembly of preformed titania, platinum nanoparticles and multilayer reduced graphene oxide (m-rGO) in a H2O/DMF dispersion followed by gelation and CO2 supercritical drying. The solid and crystalline pure TiO2 aerogel exhibited high surface area of around 500m2 g−1 and pore sizes of around 17nm, respectively. The addition of platinum (0.4wt%) or m-rGO in loading levels up to 10wt% does not compromise the mesoporous aerogel architecture. The best multicomponent catalyst showed an activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production of 11.61mmolH2 g−1 h−1. By the precise combination of different materials we demonstrated that it is possible to build a more complex aerogel resulting in an enhanced hydrogen evolution activity. In this way, our work provides the motivation for implementing other multicomponent aerogels compositions applied in the area of photocatalysis."
