0,Introduction,"Increasing worldwide energy need, diminishing fossil fuel supplies, and the increase in the levels of greenhouse emissions are the major reasons for recent research activities on sustainable energy sources that could substitute for fossil fuels. Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly fuel since its combustion produces only water vapor instead of greenhouse gases like CO2. Furthermore, hydrogen has a high energy yield of 122kJ/g, which is about 2.75 times greater than the energy yield of hydrocarbon fuels (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). On these grounds, hydrogen is considered as a promising alternative to fossil fuels for the future to meet growing energy demand. Some of the conventional hydrogen gas production methods are steam reforming of natural gas, gasification of coal, and electrolysis of water (Nath and Das, 2004). However, these processes do not accomplish the dual goal of waste reduction and renewable energy production. Bio-hydrogen production from wastes via fermentation, however, leads to waste stabilization as well as energy production. The fermentative conversion of organic compounds into bio-hydrogen is achieved by photo-fermenting (light dependent) and dark-fermenting (light-independent) bacteria. Dark fermentation has been widely used to produce bio-hydrogen (Ray et al., 2008; Nath and Das, 2004), because bio-hydrogen production rates (8.2–121mmolH2/L/h) are higher than those of the photo fermentation (0.16mmolH2/L/h) (Levin et al., 2004). Furthermore, the former process uses various complex organic substrates and organic acids which are found in many industrial effluents and agriculture residues, while the latter converts only short-chain organic acids to hydrogen (Ray et al., 2008). This is advantageous because not only is waste stabilization achieved but also valuable metabolites such as acetic, butyric and lactic acids are produced (Kim et al., 2006) from wastes which can be considered “free” carbon sources. Numerous studies on bio-hydrogen production have been conducted using organic wastes as substrate. Examples include synthetic wastewater (4.48mol-H2/mol sucrose; Zhang and Shen, 2007), crude cheese-whey (7.89mmolH2/g lactose; Ferchichi et al., 2005), wastewater sludge (0.9mmolH2/g dried solids; Wang et al., 2003), rice winery wastewater (1.37–2.14molH2/mol hexose; Yu et al., 2002), sucrose rich synthetic wastewater (46.6mLH2/g COD; Ginkel et al., 2001), and food waste (31.0LH2/g COD; Han and Shin, 2004). In mixed anaerobic cultures, bio-hydrogen produced by hydrogen-producing bacteria is consumed immediately by hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Ray et al., 2008). Therefore, methanogens should be inhibited or eliminated to produce bio-hydrogen with mixed anaerobic cultures. Several methods have been reported to inhibit methanogenic activity and selectively enrich hydrogen-producing acidogenic seeds from mixed anaerobic cultures. These are heat treatment (Zhu and Béland, 2006; Han and Shin, 2004), aeration (Zhu and Béland, 2006), acid and base treatment (Chen et al., 2002), and inhibition through chemical addition such as 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) and iodopropane (Zhu and Béland, 2006; Chidthaisong and Conrad, 2000). Sugar-beet processing industry wastes have significant potential as a renewable resource of fuel (Zuhal and Kemal, 2004). Thus, numerous studies have been conducted on bio-hydrogen production using sugar industry wastes as a carbon source. For example, Ueno et al. (1996) acquired a bio-hydrogen yield of 2.52mol H2/mol glucose from sugar factory wastewater, Wu and Lin (2004) obtained hydrogen production yield of 47.1mmol-H2/g COD by using molasses wastewater as a substrate, and Hussy et al. (2005) obtained hydrogen yields of 1.7–1.9 and 1.7mol/mol hexose for refined sucrose and pulped sugar-beet, respectively. However, bio-hydrogen production from co-digestion of different sugar industry wastes (wastewater, beet-pulp, etc.) has been subjected to very limited studies. The sugar-beet processing industry consumes a large amount of energy and produces a considerable amount of wastes. Some measures have been investigated to reduce energy consumption and enable waste minimization (Krajnc et al., 2007). Sugar production has considerable potential in Turkey, which is one of the major sugar producing countries in the world (Zuhal and Kemal, 2004). Therefore, bio-hydrogen production from sugar industry wastewater as well as beet-pulp via dark fermentation may serve the dual goal of waste minimization and renewable energy production in Turkey. The aim of this research, then, was to investigate the effect of different culture types on the bio-hydrogen production by using sugar-beet processing wastewater and beet-pulp."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Waste characteristics,"2.1 Waste characteristics Sugar industry wastes (wastewater and pressed beet-pulp) were obtained from a private beet-sugar factory located near Amasya, Turkey. The characterizations of the wastewater and pressed beet-pulp are given in Tables 1 and 2 . After characterization, the wastes were kept frozen at −20°C until being used in the experiments. Prior to the characterization and use in the study, wastewater was settled for 2h to eliminate the inorganic suspended materials which are commonly found in sugar-beet processing wastewater. The time period of 2h represents the typical hydraulic retention time of primary sedimentation (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). In order to achieve physical homogeneity, the beet-pulp was thawed at room temperature and dried at 105°C for 24h. Then, the dried pulp was ground with a pestle."
3,Basal medium,"2.2 Basal medium Basal medium (BM) contained all the necessary micro- and macro-nutrients for an optimum anaerobic microbial growth. In this study, the medium composition was as follows (concentration of the constituents are given in parentheses as mg/L): NH4Cl (1200), MgSO4·7H2O (400), KCl (400), Na2S·9H2O (300), CaCl2·2H2O (50), (NH4)2·HPO4 (80), FeCl2·4H2O (40), CoCl2·6H2O (10), KI (10), (NaPO3)6 (10), MnCl2·4H2O (0.5), NH4VO3 (0.5), CuCl2·2H2O (0.5), ZnCl2 (0.5), AlCl3·6H2O (0.5), NaMoO4·2H2O (0.5), H3BO3 (0.5), NiCl2·6H2O (0.5), NaWO4·2H2O (0.5), Na2SeO3 (0.5), Cysteine (10) (Gungor-Demirci and Demirer, 2004)."
4,Inoculum,"2.3 Inoculum Four different types of cultures were used as seed in the experiments; mixed anaerobic culture (MAC), mixed anaerobic culture with BES (BMAC), heat treated mixed anaerobic culture (HMAC), and acidogenic culture (AC) population. 2.3.1 Mixed anaerobic culture (MAC) The mixed anaerobic cultures were obtained from the anaerobic sludge digesters of the Ankara wastewater treatment plant. The mixed anaerobic culture was concentrated by settling 24h and then the concentrated sludge was filtered through a screen with a pore size of 1mm before used. The volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the concentrated seed cultures was 18730mg/L. 2.3.2 Mixed anaerobic culture with BES (BMAC) To prevent methanogenic activity in the reactors, BMAC was prepared by adding 10mM BES to the mixed anaerobic culture (Chidthaisong and Conrad, 2000). 2.3.3 Heat treated mixed anaerobic culture (HMAC) To inhibit the bioactivity of the hydrogen consumers and to enrich spore-forming hydrogen-producing acidogens, MAC was heated at 100°C for 15min (Han and Shin, 2004). 2.3.4 Acidogenic culture (AC) AC was prepared as explained in Experiment 1 below. VSS concentration of acidogenic culture (540mg/L) was concentrated to 6630mg/L by settling prior to use in the experiments."
5,Experiments and procedures,"2.4 Experiments and procedures 2.4.1 Experiment 1: culture enrichment A continuously stirred 2000mL reactor fed with glucose was operated in fed-batch mode at 35±1°C for 81days to enrich acidogenic species present within the mixed anaerobic culture. The hydraulic retention time (HRT), organic loading rate (OLR) and the initial pH of the reactor were 3days, 2.5g/L day and 8.03, respectively. The initial VSS concentration of the inocula was 12,050mg/L. The value and stability of pH in the reactor are important to suppress hydrogen consumption and obtain enriched cultures of hydrogen-producing acidogenic bacteria. Since the pH 5.5 was optimum for hydrogen production from glucose (Fang and Liu, 2002), the aim was to stabilize pH value around 4.5–6 (Fig. 1 ). The OLR was varied between 2.5g glucose/L to 4g glucose/L to control the pH. 2.4.2 Experiment 2: bio-hydrogen production This experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of culture type, pH and nutrient supplementation on the bio-hydrogen production from sugar industry wastes. Separate and co-digestion of wastewater and beet-pulp were investigated in 110-mL anaerobic batch reactors with 60mL effective volume. The experiments were conducted at two different COD levels (4,5g/L COD and 30g/L COD) to evaluate the effect of COD concentrations on hydrogen production. All the experiments were performed at a constant mesophilic temperature of 35±1°C and the VSS concentration in the reactors were adjusted to 1800mg/L. Four different experiments were conducted (Table 3 ). Five batch reactors were operated in each experiment. The reactors in Experiments 2.1 and 2.4 were supplemented with BM to determine the effect of nutrient and trace metal supplementation on hydrogen production. Optimum pH range for hydrogen production is reported as 5–6 (Fang and Liu, 2002). Thus, pH was adjusted to 5.4 by 2M NaOH and 2M HCI solutions in Experiment 2.3 to operate the reactors at this range. Furthermore, the reactors in Experiment 2.1 contained 4.5g/L COD (only wastewater) while the reactors in other experiments contained 30g/L COD (wastewater and beet-pulp) (Table 3). Different culture types were used to investigate the effect of using different types of inoculums (seed) on the acidification and hydrogen production of wastewater and beet-pulp. Four different inoculums (MAC, BMAC, HMAC and AC) were used in each experiment. Moreover, unseeded reactors (US) were prepared to investigate the hydrogen production activities of indigenous microorganisms in each experiment. A total of 20 batch reactors were used during the study (Table 4 ). After seeding and adding the substrate, the initial anaerobic environment in the reactors was established by purging with nitrogen gas for 3min at the start of cultivation. Then, the reactors were capped tightly with natural rubber stoppers and plastic screw-caps and incubated in a shaker at 175rpm in a constant temperature room (35±1°C) for 215h (Owen et al., 1979; Erguder et al., 2000). To avoid sunlight, bottles were covered with aluminum foil. By doing this, the production of hydrogen by photosynthetic bacteria was prevented (Fang and Liu, 2002)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Daily biogas productions in each bottle were periodically measured using a 10mL gas-tight syringe (Sanitex, Italy). Gas compositions were periodically analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Thermo Electron Co., Thailand) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using helium as a carrier gas at a constant pressure of 100kPa. The inlet and detector temperatures were set to 50°C and 80°C, respectively. Pure gases were used as calibration standards. Hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), methane (CH4) and nitrogen (N2) gases were detected by the help of two columns in series (CP-Moliseve 5A and CP-Porabond Q) at a fixed oven temperature of 45°C. For volatile fatty acid (VFA) measurements, samples were filtered by 0.22μm pore sized filters. Then, the filtered samples were acidified with 98% formic acid to a pH less than 2.5, in order to convert the fatty acids to their undissociated forms (i.e. acid forms). Acidified samples were measured in a gas chromatograph (Thermo Electron Co., Thailand) for their VFA contents (acetic, propionic, butyric, iso-butyric, valeric, iso-valeric, caproic, iso-caproic and heptanoic acids) with a Nukol column (Model 25326, 15m×0.53mm). The flame ionization detector (FID) was operated at 280°C. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 6mL/min and the inlet temperature was kept at 250°C. The oven temperature was initially set to 100°C with 2min holding time and then increased to 200°C with 8°C/min ramping. The concentrations of separate VFAs were expressed in terms of acetic acid equivalents by dividing the concentration value by its molecular weight and multiplying with the molecular weight of acetic acid. Total volatile fatty acid (tVFA) was determined by the sum of concentrations of all VFA species expressed as acetic acid equivalents. Solids, total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD) for beet-pulp, total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), P Total and alkalinity measurements were done in accordance with Standard Methods for the examination of water and wastewater (APHA, 2005). pH measurements were conducted with a pH meter (HI 8314, Hanna Instruments, Italy) and a pH probe (HI 1230, Hanna Instruments, Italy). Total and soluble chemical oxygen demand (tCOD and sCOD, respectively) were performed for wastewater with the help of a spectrophotometer (SN 05827, PC Multidirect, Germany) and vials specifically prepared for the COD range of 0–1500mg/L. sCOD was measured after filtering by 0.45μm pore sized filters. ORP values of the reactors were measured with a pH meter (PH 510, Eutech) equipped with an ORP electrode (Recorder S-500C, Sensorex, Italy)."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Experiment 1: culture enrichment,"3.1 Experiment 1: culture enrichment This experiment was designed to prepare acidogenic culture from mixed anaerobic cultures. To this purpose, pre-acidification of glucose was conducted. Since hydrogen-producing bacteria grow much faster than methanogens, low hydraulic retention time (3days) was chosen to enrich spore-forming, hydrogen-producing acidogens. As shown in Fig. 1c, the initial VSS of 12050mg/L decreased rapidly to 540mg/L in the first 12days of operation since hydrogen-consuming methanogens were washed out from the reactor. In addition, the initial pH of 8.03 decreased to around 5.0–5.5 as the result of acidification through OLR control (Fig. 1b). Acetate (H-Ac), propionate (H-Pr), and butyrate (H-Bu) were the major VFAs observed during the pre-acidification of glucose (Fig. 1a). According to the literature, these short-chain fatty acids were found to be dominant in acidogenic reactors (Yu and Fang, 2002). Thus, it could be speculated that the acid forming pathway dominated the metabolic flow. Acetate levels higher than 2500mg/L as are inhibitory to the methanogens. Acetate is not normally present in high levels in methanogenic anaerobic cultures because acetate acts as a substrate for methanogens (Gerardi, 2003). The acetate concentration was above 2500mg/L beyond the first 13days of operation (Fig. 1a). Moreover, the pH value was below 6.0 in the same period (Fig. 1b). Therefore, it can be postulated that methanogens were inhibited by the acidification process."
9,Experiment 2: bio-hydrogen production,"3.2 Experiment 2: bio-hydrogen production Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of culture types on bio-hydrogen production in the absence and presence of BM as well as pH correction at two different COD levels (Table 3). MAC, BMAC, HMAC, AC were used as the seed in each experiment. Moreover, unseeded reactors were also used to observe the performance of the indigenous microorganisms on bio-hydrogen production."
10,Effect of COD levels,"3.3 Effect of COD levels The maximum hydrogen production yields (20.3–87.7mL H2/g COD) were observed in reactors which contained only wastewater (4.5g/L COD) (Table 3). In Experiments 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 which contained beet-pulp and wastewater (30g/L COD) (Table 3), the yields were much lower (0.9–16.6mL H2/g COD) relative to the Experiment 2.1, in which the COD level was 4.5g/L. This is probably due to the substrate inhibition. As indicated in Table 4, high substrate concentration (30g/L COD) depressed the bio-hydrogen yields significantly. This is in agreement with the findings of Ginkel et al. (2001) which indicated that a sucrose concentration of 0.5–7.5g COD/L produced more hydrogen (22.7mL H2/g COD) than 15–45g COD/L (13.5mL H2/g COD). Similarly, Yu et al. (2002) reported that hydrogen production yields decreased with increasing substrate concentrations. Moreover, Doremus et al. (1985) stated that if hydrogen partial pressure in the headspace of the reactor equilibrates with the liquid phase H2 concentration, the pathway can be shifted to alcohol production and will produce much less hydrogen. Only the results of Experiment 2.1 were discussed below since the hydrogen production activity was relatively lower in the rest of the experiments (Table 4)."
11,Effect of culture types,"3.4 Effect of culture types The cumulative bio-hydrogen and methane productions observed for all culture types in Experiment 2 are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. High initial bio-hydrogen production rates were observed in the first 2–3day period by the consumption of easily degradable substrate for all culture types. 3.4.1 Unseeded reactors (US1) In this part of the study, bio-hydrogen was produced directly by using beet-sugar industry wastewater without any external seed addition. The maximum bio-hydrogen production yield (87.7mL H2/g COD) was observed in the unseeded reactor (Table 4). Acclimation of anaerobic microflora naturally present within the wastewater (indigenous bacteria) to the substrate could be the reason for maximum hydrogen production. The sugar industry wastewater contains acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid (Table 1). This indicates that the wastewater was already partially acidified by indigenous microorganisms before being subject to acidification in this study. Methane production was not detected in US1 (Fig. 2b), indicating the inhibition of methanogenic activity. Furthermore, the maximum hydrogen production yield in this study was comparable with the 89.2mL H2/g COD, which was observed at a continuous anaerobic system by using sucrose as the substrate with anaerobic mixed communities (Sung et al., 2002). 3.4.2 Mixed anaerobic culture (MAC1) MAC1 produced relatively higher amount of hydrogen per g COD (48.9mL H2/g COD) than other culture types (Table 4). In MAC1, which is untreated mixed anaerobic culture, enrichment of hydrogen-producing microorganisms was not practiced. On this account, higher diversity of microorganisms could be associated with the higher bio-hydrogen production compared to other culture types (Zhu and Béland, 2006). Furthermore, lower methane production (2.58mL) was observed when compared with the bio-hydrogen production (13.20mL) in MAC1 (Fig. 2a and b). This suggests that there were other factors, apart from pre-treatment, that repressed the activity of methanogens and enabled a suitable environment for hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Fig. 3 illustrated the initial and final pH value of MAC1. A pH decrease from 6.5 to 5.0 was observed during the experiment as a result of carboxylic acids formation (Ray et al., 2008). External alkalinity was not added to the reactor in order to enable acidic conditions. Therefore, it is claimed that the inherent and uncontrolled pH drop are the main factors responsible for repression of methanogenic activity in MAC1. This is expected because the optimum pH range for methanogens is 6.8–7.2 (Gerardi, 2003). On the contrary, since the pH range of 5.0–6.0 is optimum for acidogens (Ginkel et al., 2001), an inherent pH drop enables suitable environment for hydrogen-producing microorganisms. 3.4.3 Mixed anaerobic culture with BES (BMAC1) BES, which is a structural analog of the co-enzyme-M, was used to prevent methanogenic activity in the reactor because only methanogens contain this enzyme; while other microbial genes do not (Zhu and Béland, 2006). As depicted in Fig. 2b, the addition of 10mM of BES did not lead to a complete cessation of methane production. However, minimum methanogenic activity (0.25mL) was observed in BMAC1 when compared to MAC1, HMAC1 and AC1 (Fig. 2b). BES addition reduced the methane production relative to the untreated culture (2.58mL). Low methanogenic activity suggested that 10mM BES addition was enough to repress methanogenic activity significantly. Furthermore, BMAC1 did not indicate a high level of bio-hydrogen production. Hydrogen production of BMAC1 (40.5mL H2/g COD) was less when compared to untreated culture (48.9mL H2/g COD) (Table 4). Wang et al. (2003) reported that the addition of 100mM of BES to wastewater sludge did not promote the production of bio-hydrogen; on the contrary it reduced the bio-hydrogen yield. Consistent with the results from the Wang et al. (2003), BES addition suppressed the bio-hydrogen production in this study. 3.4.4 Heat treated mixed anaerobic culture (HMAC1) Heat treatment of sludge inactivates or eliminates non-spore-forming bacteria such as methanogens and prevents conversion of hydrogen into methane (Sung et al., 2002). In HMAC1, heat treatment was used to enable the spore-forming hydrogen-producing bacteria to dominate in the system. The maximum methanogenic activity was observed in HMAC1 after the MAC1 (Fig. 2a). In addition, a lower hydrogen production yield was recorded (20.3mL H2/g COD) compared to cultures (BMAC1 and AC1) as can be seen in Fig. 2a. In summary, heat treated sludge did not significantly curtail methanogenic activity but considerably suppressed the bio-hydrogen production (Fig. 2a and b). Sung et al. (2002) were able to produce high levels of hydrogen (75.5mL H2/g COD) from sucrose (10g sucrose/L or 11.23g COD/L) by using heat treated sludge. This value is higher than the hydrogen production yield observed in this study (20.3mL H2/g COD). The difference is probably due to the fact that Sung et al. (2002) used a pure substrate (sucrose) in their study. The sugar industry wastewater used in our work, on the other hand, is of a heterogeneous nature. However, other factors might have played a role in this observed difference in hydrogen production yields. The lower activity level of the spore-forming acetogens, such as Clostridium aceticum which produces acetic acid from hydrogen and carbon dioxide (Brock and Madigan, 1988), could be another reason. Most clostridium species are strict anaerobes and oxygen present in the liquid medium may cause the inhibition of these obligate anaerobic bacteria (Hussy et al., 2005). Non-spore-forming facultative anaerobes enable a reduced environment by consuming oxygen. Heat treatment causes non-spore-forming facultative anaerobes to die. Thus, possible inhibition of facultative anaerobes could be the other reason of the low hydrogen production yield (Hussy et al., 2005). 3.4.5 Acidogenic culture (AC1) Hydrogen production activity of previously prepared acidifying culture was investigated by AC1. The culture enrichment did not lead to notable inhibition on methanogenic activity (Fig. 2b). Yu et al. (2002) produced hydrogen from rice winery wastewater by anaerobic acidogenesis. The results of this experiment indicated that biogas produced contained mostly hydrogen and carbon dioxide and methane production was not observed. On the contrary, acidogenic activity was repressed and low bio-hydrogen production yield (29.5mL H2/g COD) was observed (Table 4). As seen in Fig. 3 initial pH values of reactors in Experiment 2.1 were between 6.5 and 7.0 and these pH values decreased to 4.5–5.0 at the end of the experiment. The hydrogen yield can be reduced by acetogens. Acetogens such as spore-forming Clostridium aceticum and non-spore-forming Acetobacterium woodii produce acetic acid from hydrogen and carbon dioxide (Brock and Madigan, 1988). Therefore, activity of acetogenic bacteria can be the reason for low hydrogen production."
12,Conclusions,"The following conclusions can be drawn based on the experimental results of this study: • The main fermentation products were acetate, propionate, butyrate during pre-acidification of glucose; indicating the dominance of the acidogenic pathway. • Increasing the substrate concentration from 4.5 to 30g COD/L with pulp addition depressed the bio-hydrogen yields significantly. Namely from 20.3–87.7 to 0.9–16.6mL H2/g COD at 4.5 and 30g COD/L, respectively. • The maximum hydrogen yield of 87.7mL H2/g COD was obtained without adding any external seed. This indicates that sugar industry wastes do not need external seed addition for bio-hydrogen production. • In reactors inoculated with mixed anaerobic cultures, the inherent pH decrease repressed the methanogenic activity and created a suitable medium for hydrogen production. • The methanogenic activity inhibition methods (BES addition, heat treatment and pre-acidification) were ineffective in inhibiting the methanogenic activity completely and enhancing bio-hydrogen production significantly for the conditions studied."
