0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier since it possesses the highest energy content per unit weight (about 120.7MJ/kg) of any known fuel (Hou et al., 2009). It burns cleanly, without generating any environmental pollutants and its only by-product is water. H2 is one of the most important energy carriers and is widely used in fuel cells, ammonia production, oil refineries, and methanol production. Over 75% of H2 at room temperature is ortho-hydrogen. At very low temperatures, ortho-hydrogen becomes unstable and changes to more stable para-hydrogen, releasing heat in the process. This heat can complicate low temperature hydrogen processes, particularly liquefaction, for which steam reforming at high temperature is a suitable platform (Mohanty et al., 2011a,b; Patel et al., 2012). Currently, H2 is produced commercially by CSR of natural gas and oil-derived naphtha, partial oxidation of heavy oils, gasification of coal as well as electrolysis of water (Pefia et al., 1996; Takanabe et al., 2004, 2006a,b). Bio-oil produced from biomass has been proposed as an alternative source to produce hydrogen because it does not contribute to a net increase in atmospheric CO2. Bio-oil is a dark brown organic liquid, which exhibits a complex composition with more than 200 different compounds, including acids, alcohols, glycerol, aldehydes, ketones as well as lignin derived oligomers emulsified in the presence of water (Dou et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2009; Slinn et al., 2008). Bio-oil is difficult to reform directly, but steam reforming of the main components in bio-oil such as acetic acid (12–14% by wt.) is feasible (Marquevich et al., 1999; Xun and Gongxuan, 2007; Aristides and Xenophon, 2008; Xun and Gongxuan, 2010). Generally, steam reforming of bio-oil is simplified to the following reactions. (Chornet and Czernik, 2002; Cortright et al., 2002; Takanabe et al., 2004; Basagiannis and Verykios, 2007): (1) C n H m O k + ( n - k ) H 2 O = n CO + ( n + m / 2 - k ) H , 2 ( Steam reforming reaction ) The above reaction is followed by the water–gas shift reaction: (2) n CO + n H 2 O = n CO 2 + n H 2 Therefore, the overall process can be represented as follows: (3) C n H m O k + ( 2 n - k ) H 2 O = n CO 2 + ( 2 n + m / 2 - k ) H 2 Takanabe et al. (2004) studied the CSR of acetic acid over Pt/ZrO2 catalyst and Basagiannis and Verykios (2006), Xun and Gongxuan (2007) investigated the influence of Ni and noble metals with supports (Al2O3, La2O3/Al2O3, MgO/Al2O3) on CSR of acetic acid. Takanabe et al. (2004, 2006a), and Vagia and Lemonidou (2007) studied the thermal decomposition and its reforming tendency in the absence and presence of steam for different metals supported by calcium aluminate. Coke deposition on the catalyst surface is a serious problem and the rate of coke formation is higher in case of nickel catalyst in comparison to noble metal catalyst, but noble metal catalysts are very expensive. The catalyst preparation and selection of support are the two crucial factors for higher hydrogen yield, low methane and carbon monoxide formation, and low deactivation of the active sites of the catalyst. The present study focused on H2 generation in presence of Cu supported by calcium aluminate with a small amount of Zn. These metals are cheap, easily available, but still showed a high yield of H2 with negligible coke formation (Ekaterini and Angeliki, 2007; Xun and Gongxuan, 2007; Dave and Pant 2011). Reforming of acetic acid for H2 production can be summarized as follows: (a) Steam reforming of acetic acid reaction as stated below: (4) CH 3 COOH → H 2 O 2 CO + 2 H 2 ; Δ H 298 K 0 = 213.4 kJ / mol (b) Followed by water gas shift reaction: (5) CO + H 2 O → Catalyst CO 2 + H 2 ; Δ H 298 K 0 = - 41 kJ / mol The overall steam reforming reaction of acetic acid is: (6) CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O → Catalyst 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 ; Δ H 298 K 0 = 131.4 kJ / mol The maximum stoichiometric yield of H2 from acetic acid reforming is 2 mole to mole of carbon. However some undesired reactions take place inside the reactor. Hence there is large possibilities of decomposition of acetic acid to lower molecular weight oxygenates, lighter hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H4) and coke formation (Dave and Pant 2011; Patel et al., 2012). The comparative analysis of different catalyst used in reforming process towards H2 production with acetic acid and other model compounds, varying different process parameters like steam to carbon (S/C) ratio, temperature and space velocity by different group of researcher are summarized in Table 1 (7) C 2 H 4 O 2 → C x H y O z + Carbon + Gases ( H 2 ,CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , C x H x + 2 ) Some amount of coke can also be formed via Boudouard reaction (8) 2 CO ↔ CO 2 + C; Δ H 298 K 0 = - 172.4 kJ / mol The desired gaseous product like H2 is lost through methanation reaction and reverse water gas shift reaction (Eqs. (9) and (10)) (9) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O; Δ H 298 K 0 = - 206.1 kJ / mol (10) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O; Δ H 298 K 0 = - 165.1 kJ / mol (11) 2 CH 3 COOH ↔ CH 3 COCH 3 + CO 2 + H 2 O; Δ H 298 K 0 = - 165.1 kJ / mol (12) 2 CH 3 COOH ↔ ( CH 3 ) 2 CO + CO 2 + H 2 O Small amount of acetone may be formed by ketonization reaction (Eq. (12)) from acetic acid decomposition. Different definition for % H2 yield, % acetic acid (AAc.) conversion and % selectivity of gaseous product distribution are used to describe the catalytic results of CSR using the oxygenates. The definitions are given below (Eqs. (13)–(16)) (Basagiannis and Verykios, 2006; Dave and Pant 2011; Patel et al., 2012). (13) % H 2 yield = moles of H 2 in gaseous product 4 × moles of acetic acid fed × 100 (14) % selectivity of H 2 = moles of H 2 in gaseous product C atoms in gaseous phase × 1 RR × 100 where RR is H2/CO2 reforming ratio and RR=4/2 (15) % selectivity of ‘ i ’ = C atom in species ‘ i ’ C atoms in gaseous phase × 100 (16) % AAc conversion = moles of AAc in - moles of AAc out moles of AAc in × 100"
1,Methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The carrier consisting of xCaO·yγ-Al2O3 at a molar ratio x/y =12/7 was prepared by solid state reaction between CaCO3 and γ-Al2O3 at 1300°C for 20h. A solution containing the precursor of Cu (NO3)2·3H2O and Zn (NO3)2·6H2O (Merck, Germany) was mixed with the support particles and dried in a vacuum rotary evaporator at 90±3°C for 4h, where 10%Cu·1%Zn on 12CaO·7Al2O3 was targeted. After drying, the sample was kept inside the dryer over night at 120±5°C. The catalyst was calcined under air flow at 550±5°C. The nominal metal composition of the final catalyst was 10wt.% for Cu and 1wt.% for Zn. The catalyst support was designated as Ca-12/Al-7, and the catalyst as Cu–Zn–Ca12/Al-7."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The surface areas and pore volumes of the fresh and used catalyst were analyzed using the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm. The BET surface area, total pore volume and pore size distribution of the catalyst were determined from nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms measured at −196°C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus. Prior to gas adsorption measurements, the catalyst was degassed at 150±1°C under vacuum for 6h. The total pore volume was calculated at a relative pressure of ≅0.989. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Philips powder diffractometer, with Cu-Kα radiation. The morphology of the catalyst sample was investigated using SEM-EDX with a ZEISS EVO Series Scanning Electron Microscope EVO 50. Scanning Electron Microscope EVO 50 having the resolution of 2.0nm at 30kV (SE with LaB6 option) with magnification ranges up to 1,000,000× and at an acceleration voltage of 10kV. TEM was performed using a PHILIPS CM12 microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 100kV (Patel et al., 2012; Mohanty et al., 2011a)."
4,Catalytic testing,"2.3 Catalytic testing Testing was performed at atmospheric pressure in a laboratory unit equipped with a mass flow-controlled system and a fixed-bed tubular reactor designed for an offline gas chromatograph. The exit gas composition from the reactor was determined by a gas chromatograph (Nucon 5765) equipped with a TCD mode (Nucon Engineers, Delhi, India). A peristaltic pump was used for the feeding of the mixture of acetic acid and water to the reactor through a preheater arrangement. The reactor was made of a cylindrical inconel 600 cup of 19mm diameter and 30mm length, perforated on its bottom with orifices of 0.5mm diameter to enable the flow of gases. It was assembled in a SS 316 reactor of 780mm length×19mm ID with a thermo well and feed inlet. The furnace consisted of three heating zones and proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers with an electronic temperature indicator installed at each zone for accurate reactor temperature control. To monitor the temperature periodically a thermocouple was installed in the thermo well of the reactor assembly. Hot gases exiting the reactor were cooled to condense the vapour mixture to produce unconverted liquid reactants and the uncondensed gases analyzed using Nucon 5700 gas chromatograph operated on TCD mode. The experiments were performed in the temperature range of 600–800°C at atmospheric pressure for a concentration of 10wt.% of acetic acid in distilled water. Three gram of catalyst was placed inside the catalyst bed for every run and the flow rate of reactant was maintained at 0.38mL/min. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25mL/min using a mass flow meter. The catalysts were reduced at 750±5°C under 50% H2/He flow for 3h followed by reforming experiments, as temperature programmed reduction analysis provides the reduction temperature profile to be followed (Dave and Pant 2011; Patel et al., 2012)."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Characterization of the support and the catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the support and the catalyst The details of the catalysts composition as determined by EDX point analysis are presented in Table 2 . The porosity of the catalyst is revealed by their prominent surface area. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms are summarized in Table 3 . Supplemental Fig. 1(A and B) shows the XRD patterns of the support and the catalyst, after calcination. The XRD peaks at different 2θ value for the support are shown in Table 4 . 12CaO·7Al2O3 is the major phase with some minor phases i.e. CaAl4O7 and Ca5Al6O14 and size of the support particle ranges from 8 to 23nm. Ca5Al6O14, CaAl4O7, 12CaO·7Al2O3 and CaCO3 phases were detected based on their different 2θ values with conformation from JCPDS-720767, related to monoclinic and end centered lattice revealed from JCPDS-461475. The lattice parameters (f.c.c) were calculated at (4 4 4) using the equation: α f . c . c = 2 λ Sinθ ; where λ=is the wave length of radiation and θ =Bragg’s angle. Calcium and alumina were also found in the form of Ca5Al6O14 phases, among which some were cubic, body-centered cubic (b.c.c), and some were end-centered with an orthorhombic or monoclinic nature (Tien-Thao et al., 2007; Mohanty et al., 2011a; Patel et al., 2012). The surface area of the fresh catalyst and the support are provided in Table 3. Supplemental Fig. 2(A and B) shows SEM photographs of fresh catalyst and support after calcinations. The metals were uniformly distributed on the catalyst surface. The largest particles and the most heterogeneous size distribution were observed for the calcium support, whereas the alumina has a lower, but homogeneous particle size were varied in the range of ∼30–50nm. These findings are in good agreement with other literatures (Tien-Thao et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2012; Vagia and Lemonidou, 2008). The boundary between metals and support for CuZnNi and Ca12Al7 became indistinct in comparison with the support only. With assumption that all the metals were present on the surface are spherical in nature; corresponding to sizes and distribution of weight can be given by TEM, where metal dispersion (DM) was calculated using the following equation given by (Tien-Thao et al., 2007; Mohanty et al., 2011a; Patel et al., 2012). D M = 6 × 10 7 V M A M 1 d ( nm ) ; where V M is the bulk atomic volume of the metals (cm3), A M is the area of an atom (cm2), and d is the metal particle size in nm. For Zn and Cu (as Cu and Zn having nearer atomic weight), their V M is very close to one another, so average V M = ( 1.10 × 10 - 23 cm 3 was taken; and their A M = 1 × 10 - 15 cm 2 was considered (Tien-Thao et al., 2007). The catalyst with a lower Cu–Zn content had a larger metal dispersion on the face-centered cubic (f.c.c) crystals, indicating more metal sites are available on the surface. To obtain monophasic calcium aluminates and kinetically favored conditions with a higher (Ca/Al) ratio from the support material, high temperature calcination is desirable. Whereas after Cu–Zn metal impregnation it desirable to calcine at two stages like 550±5 and 850±5°C, which is most suitable to enhance spill over activity as well as to cast distinct CuO and ZnO sites. 12CaO·7Al2O3 exhibits as a major phase with additional minor phases like CaAl4O7 and Ca5Al6O14. Both these phenomena are well supported by other authors (Galda´mez et al., 2005; Vagia and Lemonidou, 2008, and Patel et al., 2012) for this sort of catalyst to reduce at higher temperature like 600±10°C, providing two stage of post calcination for 4h. The XRD analysis for calcined catalyst provides many prominently stable and distinct phases. The Cu–Zn catalyst supported on Ca–Al exhibit low surface area as the intermediate hydration with partial dissolution of Ca–Al phases occurred by heat treatment at 900°C and subsequent formation of the dehydrated phases with addition of Cu–Zn, followed by reduction at 750°C makes the catalyst more stable and prominent. From TPR analysis the reduction peaks centered at 245 and 295°C respectively breaking the CuO to Cu2+ ion whereas the other peak rounded at 490°C associated with the reduction of ZnO to Zn0, which bonded to the support (Ca-12/Al-7). Similar TPR results have been presented for the reduction of CaxAlyOz for promotion of transition metal like Cu and Zn (Patel et al., 2012). For Ca-12/Al-7, a broad peak was obtained at slightly higher temperature of 705°C as it favors both WGS and reforming reaction in the reaction zones (650–750°C) to generate stable phases. Supplemental Fig. 3(A and B) shows the TEM image of the fresh catalyst and support, respectively. The support particles are spherical in nature and diameter of the support particle varies from 15 to 25nm. The catalyst particle diameter is varied from 28 to 34nm. In the used catalyst most of the metal particles were found above the carbon filament, although there were some metal particles encapsulated within the filaments which possibly helped in the simultaneous water shift gas reaction and carbon formation with an auto consumption process (Segner et al., 1984). Thus, small metal particles (⩾10nm) generate the carbon filaments with a short diameter and a thermodynamically unfavorable growth due to higher (S/C) ratio. Moreover, carbon gasification towards CO2 (a structure-sensitive reaction) is favored in smaller particles (Vagia and Lemonidou 2007; Zhang et al., 2008). During CSR of the acetic acid mixture, some active sites of Cu and Zn on the catalyst surface are deactivated by carbon deposition (Chen et al., 2011). When subsequent layer of carbon deposition starts to form on different sites of active metals, the hydrocarbon (like ketons) can be adsorbed on site of catalyst surface and decomposed to carbon atoms giving rise to carbonaceous atomic groups which might stay on catalyst surface for longer duration and blocks the activity of metal (Cu) atoms. At that emergency the Zn particle is forced to break the inter-cohesive force between catalyst active sites and carbide, as the carbide starts off to grow."
7,Steam reforming of the acetic acid,"3.2 Steam reforming of the acetic acid 3.2.1 Effect of temperature on reforming acetic acid reforming Thermodynamic analysis suggested that % yield of H2 increased with temperature and attained the maximum of 96% at 680°C, 1atm pressure and 10wt.% acetic acid concentration. Whereas further increase in temperature favored methanation reaction which increased the% H2 yield also devalue the CO selectivity due to the rapidity of reverse water gas shift reaction, but CH4 selectivity decreased with temperature as steam reforming of methanation is inconsistent at high temperature. Thermodynamic findings indicates that at 680°C and 10wt.% acetic acid concentrations, maximization of H2 can be realized having the selectivity of CO and CH4 at minimum as 9% and 0.1% respectively. Sequentially higher temperature is unsuitable for selectivity of CO2. Therefore based on thermodynamics result it is found that at 680°C the percent of H2 yield was maximum. As temperature increased beyond 680°C, percent of H2 yield decreased approximately to 5–6% from the maximum value (96%) up to 1000°C. During reforming process the carbon species available on catalyst surface are not favoured thermodynamically in the presence of water splitting oxygen. With higher S/C ratio, higher H2 is always desirable; however the relative energy consumption and unit size increases accordingly. Temperature is the one of the dominating parameter for CSR. The yield of hydrogen was measured as the function of the steam reforming temperature ranging from 600 to 800°C for a concentration of 10wt.% acetic acid in distilled water with weight hourly space velocity of 79.2h−1. Fig. 4 (A) shows the variation of the H2 yield with different temperature for the CSR condition. Percentage of H2 yield is about 23% at 600°C and it increases to 80% as the temperature reaches to 800°C which is according to Le-Chatelier’s principle. Two undesirable products i.e. CO and CH4 are formed during steam reforming via reverse water gas shift and methanation reactions at moderate temperature (600–650°C). Some researchers found methane formation at this temperature range suits the process by decarboxylation reaction (Patel et al., 2012; Vagia and Lemonidou, 2008). As temperature increases above 650°C the reaction shifts towards ketonization which prevail along with reforming and water gas shift reactions. Sometimes high yield of ketone inevitably spoils the H2 selectivity, so optimization of temperature, steam to carbon ratio and space velocity enhances the carbon conversion and hydrogen yield to desired assessment. As temperature increased from 650 to 750°C, acetic acid conversion increased from 46% to 80%. But at 800°C, acetic acid conversion remains steady ∼81%. It can be observed that there is a weak effect of temperature on acetic acid conversion beyond 800°C. 3.2.2 Effect of run time on hydrogen yield and product distribution Fig. 4(A and B) show the moles of H2 obtained at different run times and temperatures. H2 production increased with temperature. Figs. 5 and 6 (A and B) show the product distribution in the gaseous phase with run time at different temperatures. Methane formation was significant at all temperature, but decreased with an increase in temperature possibly due to steam reforming and less mass transfer limitation. At lower temperatures, a higher rate of carbon monoxide formation took place due to improper water gas shift reaction. CO concentrations were almost negligible at higher temperatures. CO2 decreased and H2 production increased with increasing temperature. At 800°C, maximum hydrogen production was obtained with negligible amounts of CO and CH4 after 7h. Fig. 7 shows the variation of acetic acid conversion with W/FA0 (weight of catalyst to molar flow rate of acetic acid) at four different temperatures. Maximum acetic acid conversion was obtained above 750°C at a lower acetic acid flow rate (high residence time). As the flow rate increased from 0.38 to 1.3mL/min at 750°C, acetic acid conversion decreased to 32%. At 650°C, acetic acid conversion decreased from 71% to 36% as the acetic acid flow rate increased from 0.38 to 1.3mL/min."
8,Conclusions,"The representative model compound of bio-oil, acetic acid, was reformed effectively in a fixed bed in the presence of a Cu–Zn–Ca12/Al-7 catalyst. Effect of process variables such as temperature, space time and acetic acid concentration in feed over product distribution and acetic acid conversion was investigated. The yield of H2 was maximum at 800°C (80%) with negligible amount of CH4 and CO levels. The effect of coking was negligible. The physical characterization in terms of XRD, SEM, EDX and TEM confirms the presence of (15–34nm) nano-sized metal-support interaction and its uniform distribution on support (Ca12/Al-7) makes the catalyst more efficient. Phases like Ca5Al6O14, CaAl4O7 and 12CaO·7Al2O3 on support helps the CSR with negligible carbon formation. Higher temperature, higher space time and lower acetic acid feed concentration favor the increase of hydrogen yield and acetic acid conversion. Consecutively to make the process feasible attention towards the aqueous phase of biooil separation with its CSR is need of the hour."
