0,Introduction,"The development of bioactive compounds, prebiotics, detergents, animal feeds and biofuels from agricultural wastes has received much attention and is contributing to the increasing demand for fuels and functional food/feed products (Linares-Pasten et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2020). These agricultural wastes contain xylan, one of the most abundant hemicellulose components, whose use in the production of xylooligosaccharides (XOS), xylose, xylitol, and ethanol has been documented (Aachary and Prapulla, 2011). Enzyme hydrolysis is one of the most recognized methods for producing these valuable xylan by-products. In the enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan, endo-(1,4)-ß-xylanases convert xylan into XOS, xylose and xylitol. Therefore, efficient and cost-effective xylanases are needed for economically sustainable xylan hydrolysis (Javed et al., 2019). Xylanases with a wider variety of optimal conditions, stable performance, low substrate loss, and product production with fewer side effects are preferred for industrial xylan hydrolysis. However, very few, if any, xylanases have been identified that are not affected by one or more of these critical factors that influence their catalytic activity and efficiency. Xylanases with improved efficiency and inhibitor tolerance are more attractive for environmental, economic, and industrial needs (Chen et al., 2017; Javed et al., 2019). Various attempts at protein engineering have been made to improve primary sequences, structural folding, substrate specificities, temperature or pH stability, activity, and catalytic mechanisms, e.g., (Zhang et al., 2010; Boonyaputthikul et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017; Sutthibutpong et al., 2018; Prajapati et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020). Nevertheless, there are very few attempts to improve the xylanase resistance of biomass pre-treatment by-products. Biomass pre-treatment is necessary to break the lignin bond in lignocellulosic biomass so that xylanases can efficiently hydrolyze xylan and produce XOS/xylose/ethanol (Kumar et al., 2012). However, biomass pre-treatment by-products such as lignin, extractives, hemicellulose-derived and lignin-derived phenolic compounds inhibit xylanase (Morrison et al., 2011; Jonsson and Martin, 2016; Adeboye et al., 2014; Oliva-Taravilla et al., 2016), which poses a major challenge for effective xylan hydrolysis in industries combining saccharification and fermentation. In addition, the inhibitions of monomeric aromatic phenolic compounds on enzymes vary depending on the plant source, chemical composition, and pre-treatment method. For example, acidic pre-treatment releases phenolic compounds, aliphatic carboxylic acids, and furans, while alkaline pre-treatment releases dicarboxylic acids, acetic acids, hydrothermal acetic acids, hydroxy acids, phenolic compounds, and small amounts of furanaldehydes (Jonsson and Martin, 2016). In addition, the inhibitory effects of pre-treatment by-products such as phenolic compounds and lignin varied due to differences in enzyme binding behavior and properties such as size, polarity, chemical reactivity, and concentration (Muhammad et al., 2020; Silva Cde et al., 2015). Increased enzyme/cellulose concentrations, use of blocking proteins such as bovine serum albumin, and conversion of inhibitors to less inhibitory substances may help reduce the inhibitory effect of macromolecular lignin on cellulases because there are few adsorption sites for macromolecular lignin (Hamann et al., 2020). However, since phenolic compounds have many binding sites, it is challenging to remove the inhibition caused by soluble phenolic compounds by increasing the enzyme/substrate concentration or by blocking the protein (Hamann et al., 2020). Furthermore, phenolic compounds have been shown to precipitate and permanently block cellulases (Qin et al., 2016), which could also apply to xylanases. Furthermore, no detoxification process completely removes all inhibitors from biomass pre-treatment hydrolysates. For industries that integrate saccharification and fermentation, this presents a complicated problem. Understanding and minimizing the inhibitory effects of phenolic compounds during enzymatic hydrolysis is critical for increasing the efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass conversion. Therefore, enzymes resistant to inhibitors throughout the saccharification and fermentation process are likely to be highly desirable. In this context, the creation of novel efficient and inhibitor-resistant enzymes would require a deeper knowledge of the inhibitory mechanisms that impede the xylanase-mediated conversion of plant biomass. Significantly, few protein-engineered xylanases have been reported to be resistant to phenolic compounds. Examples include the Thermobacillus xylanilyticus GH11 endo-xylanase Tx-Xyl, which reduces adsorption of the enzyme to lignin, a Penicillium griseofulvum GH11 xylanase resistant to the wheat xylanase inhibitor XIP-I (Cervera Tison et al., 2009) and an Aspergillus tamarii xylanase resistant to ferulic acid (Monclaro et al., 2019). In addition, our previous computational study investigated the molecular basis for complex interactions between lignin monomers and oligomers, and the aromatic residue F124 was selected as a candidate for site-directed mutagenesis of lignin-resistant xylanase (Muhammad et al., 2020). Our group also investigated the effects of concentrated coniferyl alcohol on the proposed xylanase mutant. The results showed increased resistance of the F124A mutant to coniferyl alcohol (Muhammad et al., 2021). In a preliminary in silico experiment to identify phenolic compounds that inhibit wild-type Xyn11A, the highest inhibition was observed for coniferyl alcohol, gallic acid and ferulic acid. Following an investigation of the per-residue energy contributions of each amino acid, F124 was proposed as a phenolic compound binding site. With this background, the current study sought to elucidate the role of F124 in the inhibition of Bacillus firmus K-1 Xyn11A by monomeric aromatic phenolic compounds selected based on in silico inhibition of wild-type Xyn11A. In-vitro enzyme-phenolic compound inhibition experiments were performed to demonstrate that F124 is a phenolic compound binding site and the mechanism by which the selected monomeric aromatic phenolic compounds inhibited Xyn11A was explained using molecular docking."
1,Material and methods,
2,Production and purification of WT and F124A mutant,"2.1 Production and purification of WT and F124A mutant 2.1.1 Primer design, PCR, and cloning of WT and F124A mutant The Xyn11A gene was previously obtained from Bacillus firmus K-1 (GenBank accession number AAQ14588.1.) by Mongkorntanyatip et al. (2017), and Boonyaputthikul et al. (2019) was used and designated as wild-type Xyn11A (WT). In the sequence WT, phenylalanine (F) at position 124 was replaced with alanine (A) to generate the F124A mutant by induced site-directed mutagenesis using the previously designed forward and reverse primers (Muhammad et al., 2021). The primers were designed manually, and the signal peptide sequence was removed (Signal IP-5.0 server). The primers were analyzed to prevent dimer formation, and their melting temperature (TM) was determined to be 55 °C. EcoR1 and Nde1 restriction enzymes were used for cloning. Both the WT and F124A mutants were cloned into the pET15b thioredoxin vectors using the KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase toolkit (Merck, Germany). The PCR conditions used were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 55 °C for 10 s, polymerization at 70 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 70 °C for 3 min (Muhammad et al., 2021). The size of the target genes was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Then, the purified (using FavorPrepTM PCR Clean-Up kit, Favorgen, Taiwan) PCR products (10 μg) and the thioredoxin-fused pET15b vector (8 μg) were digested separately with the same restriction enzymes (RE) in a reaction mixture containing 10X CutSmart buffer and nuclease-free water. The RE digested pET15b vector was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) and then precipitated with ethanol. The RE digested PCR product of WT and F124A Xyn11A from B. firmus K-1 was also precipitated with ethanol. Then, the thioredoxin-fused pET15b vector/Xyn11A genes were separately ligated and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells and grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50 μg/mL ampicillin. Colony PCR, plasmid extraction and restriction digestion were performed to confirm the insert of the transformed colonies. Plasmids from the positive colonies were isolated and sequenced with primers for both the WT and F124A mutant. 2.1.2 Expression of the recombinant WT and F124A mutant The method for expression of xylanase genes was adopted from Boonyaputthikul et al. (2019). Briefly, the confirmed constructs of recombinant DNA (thioredoxin-fused pET15b vector/F124A mutant gene and thioredoxin-fused pET15b vector/WT gene) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and grown overnight on LB agar containing ampicillin (50 μg/mL). Then, a few colonies (5–10) were collected and grown in 5 mL LB -broth with ampicillin (50 μg/mL) for 4 h at 37 °C and 200 rpm. The starter culture was then inoculated (1%) into 2XYT broth (1 L) and incubated at 37 °C and 200 rpm. Cells were induced with 1.0 mM isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the OD600 range of 0.6–0.8 was reached and incubated for 16 h at 16 °C and 150 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 g, and the cell pellet was then mixed with 10 mL of binding buffer (50 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, 300 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 10 mM imidazole, pH8 adjusted with 15% sodium hydroxide solution) containing 0.5% TritonX100. The suspension was thoroughly mixed by vortexing, sonicated, and centrifuged at 11000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and analyzed using 12% SDS - PAGE with 4% polyacrylamide stacking gel (Bhardwaj et al., 2020) to confirm the desired recombinant WT and F124A mutant sizes. 2.1.3 Purification of produced xylanases (WT and F124A mutant) The method was adopted from Mongkorntanyatip et al. (2017) and Boonyaputthikul et al. (2019). After the Ni2+-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen, Germany) were washed with distilled water and a binding buffer, the recombinant xylanase supernatant was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a shaker. The flow-through of the column was then collected and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The protein-bound beads were washed three times with binding buffer and wash buffer (50 mM Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate Monohydrate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM imidazole, pH8 adjusted using 15% sodium hydroxide solution). After 30 min incubation, elution buffer (50 mM Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate Monohydrate, 300 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 250 mM imidazole, pH8 adjusted using 15% sodium hydroxide solution) was used to elute the recombinant proteins. The concentrations of eluted proteins were determined using Nanodrop, and SDS-PAGE verified their purity and sizes. Purified proteins were buffer-exchanged to PBS using a PD10 column. The buffer-exchanged recombinant proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and concentrated with the Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit of 10,000 kDa."
3,Residual activity of the enzymes in the presence and absence of phenolic compounds,"2.2 Residual activity of the enzymes in the presence and absence of phenolic compounds The method was adopted from Biely et al. (1988) and Mathibe et al. (2020). Briefly, the monomeric aromatic phenolic models were diluted in ethanol and water in a 1:1:1 ratio for coniferyl alcohol and a 1:2:2 ratio for gallic acid and ferulic acid. The WT and the F124A mutant activities were determined in the presence of monomeric aromatic phenolic compounds. This study required the highest concentrations of phenolic compounds ever reported in the literature to demonstrate the F124A mutant's resistance or endurance at the highest concentration possible. We then searched for the highest concentration of the same or comparable phenolic compounds and discovered that Qin et al. (2016) used the highest concentration of vanillin against cellulase, which was 1% (w/v) or 10 mg/mL. Based on this previous study, we used gallic acid and ferulic acid at a concentration of 10 mg/mL (1% w/v) in our study. Muhamad et al. (2021) utilized coniferyl alcohol at a concentration of 25 mg/mL, and we used the same concentration (2.5% (w/v) or 25 mg/mL) in our study. Furthermore, the phenolic compound concentrations used for gallic acid and ferulic acid were also within the range calculated in aqueous pre-treatment of biomass samples at the recommended high solid loading of 20% (w/v), which can result in a total phenolic concentration of approximately 10–20 mg/mL in the resulting aqueous fraction (Ximenes et al., 2011). The enzymes (0.08 mg/mL) were pre-incubated with coniferyl alcohol (2.5% w/v), ferulic acid (1% w/v), and gallic acid (1% w/v) for 5 min. The recombinant xylanase phenolic compounds mixture (20 μl) was added to 200 μl of 0.2% w/v Azo-Birchwood xylan (Megazyme). One set of enzyme/substrate mixture without inhibitors, in other sets of enzyme/coniferyl, enzyme/gallic acid and enzyme/ferulic acid mixtures, were added for each enzyme. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 50 °C to 5 min. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by incubating the mixtures at 100 °C to 15 min. After cooling, the mixtures were centrifuged, and 100 μl of the supernatant was pipetted into a 96-well microplate. The optical density (OD) was then measured at 590 nm. The PBS buffer (20 μl) was added to 200 μl of 0.2% w/v Azo-Birchwood xylan and used as a blank or negative control. Three replicates were performed, and the mean values were calculated and used to determine the enzyme residual activity. The xylanase activity for each recombinant enzyme with and without inhibitors was determined and used to calculate the percentage of residual activity per enzyme under inhibitor. The formula for percent residual xylanase activity was as follows: Percent residual activity of each enzyme activity with inhibitor divided by enzyme activity without inhibitor and multiplied by 100. The mean values of the three replicates were used to calculate the percent residual activities. The percent residual activities were evaluated using the proportional test (prop. test) in R software."
4,Molecular docking,"2.3 Molecular docking 2.3.1 Protein structural data preparation Amino acid sequences of the wild-type Xyn11A of Bacillus firmus K-1 and its F124A mutant were used to construct homology models using the SWISS-MODEL web-server (Biasini et al., 2014). The GH11 xylanase crystal structure of Bacillus circulans (PDB ID:1BVV) was used as the structural template (Kaushal et al., 2015). The predicted Xyn11A model possessed a sequence identity of 0.57 and a sequence similarity of 78.80% when compared with the template; QMEAN and GMQE scores were 1.26 and 0.96 for Xyn11A, indicating the appropriate reliability of the homology model of both the WT and the F124A mutant for further molecular docking calculations. The three-dimensional conformation of a Xyn11A enzyme resembles a right hand, with the associated thumb, palm, finger, and cord regions indicated in the tertiary structure, as shown in Fig. S1. 2.3.2 Molecular docking calculations Three-dimensional coordinates of ferulic acid, gallic acid, and coniferyl alcohol (Fig. S2) were retrieved from the PubChem database (Kim et al., 2018). The structure files were then converted into PDB format using the Avogadro software (Hanwell et al., 2012). Afterwards, coordinates of the WT and F124A structures, along with the ligands, were processed by the AutoDocktool software suite (Morris et al., 2009): (i) non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged with heavy atoms of both target proteins and ligands, (ii) Gasteiger partial charges were added to all remaining atoms. Then, a 30 × 30 × 30 Å3 grid box centered at the catalytic site between the two catalytic residues E78 and E171, was generated to completely cover the binding pocket, allowing the ligand to contact all binding sites within the binding groove. The configuration file was then created for performing molecular docking calculations by the AutoDock Vina software (Trott and Olson, 2010). After the calculation finished, 20 conformations with minimum binding energy scores were output for each protein-ligand complex. Then, protein-ligand interactions for the 20 conformations were analyzed using the protein-ligand profiler web-server (Salentin et al., 2015). The hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic networks were visualized by the VMD and Pymol softwares (Humphrey et al., 1996, Delano, 2002)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Enzyme production and purification,"3.1 Enzyme production and purification The WT and the F124A mutant were effectively cloned, transformed, and expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system with a low IPTG induction concentration. The proteins were successfully purified, and their protein sizes were confirmed by SDS -PAGE. The SDS -PAGE results showed a band with a molecular mass of 30 kDa (Fig. 1 ). The purified enzymes were soluble as protein bands were detected in the supernatant. The SDS -PAGE results were consistent with those first described by Mongkorntanyatip et al. (2017) for the same recombinant GH11 xylanase from B. firmus K-1. The size of our proteins was similar to other known GH11 family xylanases, which are typically small and smaller than 30 kDa, e.g. (Silva Cde et al., 2015; Monclaro et al., 2019)."
7,Residual activity of WT and F124A mutant with or without inhibitors,"3.2 Residual activity of WT and F124A mutant with or without inhibitors Enzyme activities of the WT and F124A mutant were performed with or without gallic acid, ferulic acid and coniferyl alcohol. Phenolic compounds showed variable inhibitory effects on WT activity, as shown in Fig. 2 . Gallic acid has the strongest inhibitory effect (52.4%), followed by ferulic acid (41.3%), and coniferyl alcohol showed the least inhibitory effect on WT (21.5%). Notably, the F124A mutant showed high tolerance ability to gallic acid, ferulic acid and coniferyl alcohol. The F124A mutant showed no inhibition by gallic acid and minimal inhibition by ferulic acid (12.6%) and coniferyl alcohol (2.1) (Fig. 2). The inhibition of WT by gallic acid was also compatible with previous studies that found that gallic acid inhibited xylanases by more than or nearly 50%. According to Morrison et al. (2011), gallic acid inhibited Clostridium cellulovorans xylanase, XynA, by 47%. In another study by Mathibe et al. (2020), gallic acid inhibited endo-1,4-xylanase, XynA, from Thermomyces lanuginosus VAPS-24 with more than 50% inhibition. Gallic acid was also found to inhibit xylanase, XynA, from Clostridium thermocellum with more than 50% (Hamann et al., 2020). Ferulic acid also inhibits Clostridium thermocellum xylanase, XynA, but its inhibitory effect was weaker than that of gallic acid (Hamann et al., 2020). Depending on the enzyme and phenolic compound, the inhibitory effect of monomeric aromatic phenolic compounds vary. According to our findings, the number of functional groups in phenolic compounds (Fig. S2 and Table S1) could have affected their in-vitro inhibitory effects on WT. Coniferyl alcohol and ferulic acid had a high structural similarity, with the only difference being that ferulic contains a carboxyl group, making ferulic acid a more potent inhibitor of WT than coniferyl alcohol. Furthermore, monomeric aromatic phenolic compounds with a methoxyl group and one hydroxyl group adjacent to their aromatic rings, such as coniferyl alcohol and ferulic acid, inhibited WT less effectively. Gallic acid, which had three hydroxyl groups adjacent to its aromatic ring, was the most effective WT inhibitor. Our findings supported previous research that linked functional groups of phenolic compounds to the inhibition of various xylanases. Hamann et al. (2020) discovered that functional groups (methoxyl and hydroxyl groups) in ferulic acid, syringaldehyde, vanillin, and gallic acid significantly contributed to the inhibition of Clostridium thermocellum xylanase, with gallic acid being the most potent inhibitor due to its high hydroxyl group content. According to Boukari et al. (2011), the hydroxyl group of phenolic compounds such as p-coumaric and caffeic acid was the primary inhibitory component for Thermobacillus xylanilyticus xylanase. In a study conducted by Mathibe et al. (2020), phenolic compounds with carbonyl groups were found to have more potent inhibitory effects, consistent with our findings that gallic acid and ferulic acid have greater inhibitory potency than coniferyl alcohol (no carbonyl group). Eventually, these results suggested that gallic acid's high number of aromatic ring hydroxyl groups compared to other phenolic compounds may be responsible for gallic acid's most potent WT inhibitory effects."
8,Interactions between xylanases and different phenolic compounds,"3.3 Interactions between xylanases and different phenolic compounds A series of molecular docking calculations were performed to explore atomistic details of WT, the F124A mutant and phenolic compounds and further validate our results from the in-vitro inhibition assays. The interactions between the enzymes and each of the three phenolic compounds were found as networks of multiple hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with several essential amino acid residues, as shown in Fig. 3 . To elucidate the inhibition mechanisms of the three phenolic compounds to WT and the highest inhibitory effect of gallic acid in-vitro, the best conformational poses of each phenolic compound interacting with the catalytic residues (E78 and E171) and the aromatic residue F124 were selected according to the lowest binding energy score. From the analysis of molecular interactions between phenolic compounds and amino acids, it was found that the difference in the number of functional groups within phenolic compounds affects the conformational poses and interactions. Hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the phenolic compounds contributed to the interactions with Xyn11A through hydrogen bonding, and the aromatic rings contributed to the interactions through pi-pi stacking. Fig. 3a showed the interactions between a coniferyl alcohol and a wild-type Xyn11A (WT). The aromatic ring of the coniferyl alcohol interacted with residue F124, located near the catalytic residue E78, and made a hydrophobic contact with the non-polar part of R112. This hydrophobic cluster formed by the aromatic ring of the phenolic compound was in concurrence with the hydrogen bonds formed between the hydroxyl group adjacent to the aromatic ring and the catalytic residue E78, which should inhibit the activity of WT. The interaction analysis between ferulic acid and WT in Fig. 3b displayed a similar inhibition mechanism to coniferyl alcohol due to the high structural similarity between these two compounds. The only difference in the structural feature was the carboxyl group of ferulic acid, which contained one more site for hydrogen bonding than the hydroxyl group of coniferyl alcohol, hence a slightly stronger binding energy predicted by molecular docking (see Table 1 ) and a higher inhibitory effect in-vitro. However, the strongest inhibitory effect on the WT in-vitro was found for gallic acid, with the highest binding energy score per molecular weight. Fig. 3c displayed the interactions between gallic acid and amino acid residues near the E78 catalytic residue of Xyn11A. Gallic acid contained three hydroxyl groups adjacent to its aromatic ring, allowing a high number of hydrogen bonds to occur close to a pi-pi stacking. In the case of binding to the binding pocket of a Xyn11A, the aromatic ring formed a pi-pi stacking with F124. The hydroxyl groups adjacent to the aromatic ring formed hydrogen bonds with R112 and the catalytic residue E78, which inhibited the enzyme. The strongest inhibition in-vitro and the strongest binding energy score per molecular weight could be explained by the compactness of the interaction network formed by gallic acid and residues F124, R112 and E78 of Xyn11A due to the high density of the gallic acid functional group."
9,The role of F124 in binding to phenolic compounds,"3.4 The role of F124 in binding to phenolic compounds The interaction analysis for the three phenolic compounds and the WT shown in Fig. 3a–c revealed the importance of F124 for its pi-pi stacking form with aromatic rings mediating the hydrogen bonds formed between these phenolic inhibitors and the catalytic residue E78. The F124A site-directed mutation performed in-vitro conferred resistance to phenolic compounds to the mutant enzyme. These counter-inhibition mechanisms were explained by the conformations obtained from molecular docking and interaction analysis between F124A and phenolic compounds, shown in Fig. 3d–f. The replacement of phenylalanine with alanine at residue 124 in the mutation resulted in the absence of the aromatic ring, which facilitated the binding of phenolic compounds to the catalytic residue E78. Therefore, hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl or carboxyl groups and E78 became weaker as non-productive bonding with non-catalytic residues within the binding pocket became favorable. Fig. 3d and e showed that coniferyl alcohol and ferulic acid became bound to Y173 and Y65, respectively, with the best binding energy score. Both Y173 and Y65 were located at the reducing end of the catalytic groove and had a high binding affinity toward aromatic compounds. Meanwhile, Fig. 3f showed that gallic acid became bound to Y69, located deeper in the catalytic groove further away from the two catalytic residues and had the highest specific binding affinity. According to all three molecular docking calculations of the binding between F124A and phenolic compounds, the counter inhibition mechanisms could be explained by aromatic ring removal at residue 124. The F124 residue of WT demonstrated its high affinity for phenolic compounds and its role in mediating the interactions between all three phenolic compounds and the E78. Since the mutation was performed to remove the aromatic ring of F124, all phenolic compounds became bound to other amino acids with aromatic side chains (Y173, Y65, and Y69). The new binding of the phenolic compounds to these tyrosine residues, away from the catalytic sites, became non-productive and thus reduced the inhibitory effect in-vitro. As a result, gallic acid also had the highest counter-inhibitory effect in-vitro, corresponding to the strongest non-productive binding that kept the compound away from the catalytic residues."
10,Conclusion,"Phenolic compounds significantly decreased WT activity, and gallic acid was the most potent inhibitor. Remarkably, the replacement of F124 with alanine increased tolerance to phenolic compounds, with gallic acid completely losing its inhibitory effect. The importance of the pi-pi stacking of F124 with the aromatic rings of phenolic compounds in facilitating hydrogen bonds between phenolic compounds and E78 in the WT was revealed by molecular docking and replacing F124 with alanine caused the phenolic compound to bind to tyrosine residues far away from the catalytic site. Our findings can guide future protein engineering efforts to create ultra-resistant xylanases for phenolic compounds to improve biomass by-product production efficiency in combined saccharification and fermentation bioreactors."
