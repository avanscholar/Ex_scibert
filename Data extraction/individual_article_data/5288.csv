0,Introduction,"Worldwide consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels increases from 90 million barrels per day in 2012 to 100 million barrels per day in 2020, and to 121 million barrels per day in 2040 [1]. According to the Renewable Energy Policy Network [2], approximately 78% of the energy used worldwide originates from fossil fuels, 3% from nuclear energy, and the remaining 19% from renewable sources of energy (for instance, solar, wind, and biomass). Lignocellulosic biomass represents an important and sustainable alternative to a large quantity of petroleum-derived chemicals, plastics, and products in use presently [3]. However, the application of biorefinery technologies on a large scale is not cost competitive compared with the use of crude oil owing to the low price of the latter [4]. Thus, biorefineries will need to produce low-volume but high-value products, such as high-value commodity chemicals, to be highly profitable [5]. For instance, cellulose derived from lignocellulosic biomass can be used to produce fuels [6,7] and versatile platform chemicals such as levoglucosenone (LGO) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) [8]. LGO and HMF can be further converted into 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HDO) via catalytic upgrading [9–11]. 1,6-HDO is a high-value commodity chemical with a market price of $4400/ton. The 1,6-HDO market size is projected to grow from $902 million in 2019 to $1401 million by 2025 at a rate of 8% per year [12]. 1,6-HDO is predominantly used as a precursor for polyester and polyurethane to increase their flexibility, hydrolytic stability, and adhesion [13]. In the current industrial process, 1,6-HDO is produced through the catalytic hydrogenation of the adipic acid or its esters [13]. The current industrial method for the production of adipic acid from benzene consists of three steps: 1) benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, 2) cyclohexane is oxidized to a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone [14,15], and 3) the mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone is oxidized to adipic acid with an excess of HNO3 over Cu and H4NO3V catalysts [16,17]. Such a conventional method has several problems such as low yields owing to the series of catalytic conversion steps, nonrenewable use of petroleum-based feedstock causing significant CO2 emissions, and homogeneous mixtures of toxic chemicals (such as HNO3 and KCN) [18]. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a new process for the production of 1,6-HDO to overcome the issues mentioned above. Recently, He et al. [10,18] showed that cellulose can be converted into 1,6-HDO via continuous catalytic reactions. These reactions consist of the following processes: 1) dehydration of cellulose into LGO and HMF using a tetrahydrofuran (THF)-H2O solvent that contains a H2SO4 catalyst; 2) hydrogenation of LGO and HMF into levoglucosanol (Lgol) and tetrahydrofuran dimethanol (THFDM), respectively, over a Ni/SiO2 catalyst; and 3) hydrogenolysis of Lgol and THFDM into 1,6-HDO simultaneously over a Pt-WOx/TiO2 catalyst. In the practical implementation of the technologies mentioned above, the process of the downstream separation block is necessary to reuse significant quantities of the THF solvent and H2 and to recover 1,6-HDO. The objective of this study is to develop a new process for the production of 1,6-HDO from cellulose including an effective separation process and to perform a technoeconomic analysis of the proposed process. In Section 2, we develop a new process, wherein 1) the detailed reactions are considered based on experimental data and 2) a separation block is constructed to reuse significant amounts of the THF solvent and H2 and to recover 1,6-HDO. In Section 3, we carry out a technoeconomic analysis alongside pioneer plant and sensitivity analyses to investigate the feasibility of the proposed process."
1,Process development,
2,Design basis and assumptions,"2.1 Design basis and assumptions Based on the experimental data and the heat and material balances calculated using Aspen Plus V10 (Aspen Technology, Inc.), the sizes and costs of all the units in the four blocks (HMF/LGO production, THFDM/Lgol production, 1,6-HDO production, and 1,6-HDO recovery) were estimated using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer V10 (Aspen Technology, Inc.) and an exponential scaling expression that was used in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) report [19]. Other blocks, including those for wastewater treatment, heat and power generation, storage, and utilities, were scaled based on a published design [19]. The heat exchanger network was formed using pinch analysis [20]. In the technoeconomic evaluation, the variable operating cost was estimated based on the prices of the raw materials (See Table C1 in Supplementary Material) [21]. All the equipment and material costs were set to a common basis year of 2015 using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index [22]. The processing rate of feedstock was set at 900 tons of cellulose per day, which is equivalent to 2000 dry tons of lignocellulosic biomass per day. We assumed a discount rate of 10%, which is commonly considered in the nth plant. A discounted cash flow analysis was used to calculate the minimum selling price (MSP) of 1,6-HDO and this rendered the net present value zero [19]."
3,Process synthesis,"2.2 Process synthesis We develop a new process of producing 1,6-HDO from cellulose. The process mainly consists of four blocks as shown in Fig. 1 : 1) HMF/LGO production, 2) THFDM/Lgol production, 3) 1,6-HDO production, and 4) 1,6-HDO recovery. The process additionally includes wastewater treatment, heat and power generation, storage, and utilities (See Table E1 in Supplementary Material for the stream data of the process flow diagram in Fig. 1). The reaction conditions and laboratory yields of the main reactions are summarized in Table 1 . For each reaction, the reaction condition is chosen to have the highest conversion yield. Cellulose (3% loading in THF solvent) is converted into HMF (25.5%) and LGO (17.1%) using THF as the solvent (stream 23) and dilute H2SO4 catalyst (stream 2) at 483 K and 74.8 atm for 55 min in the dehydration reactor (R-1). Cellulose is additionally converted into other byproducts (See Table A1 in Supplementary Material). After dehydration, H2SO4 is neutralized (R-2) using lime to obtain pH in the range 5–6 because the residual H2SO4 in the HMF-LGO mixture leads to the undesired side reaction of HMF dehydration to dimethylfuran (DMF) [10]. The HMF-LGO mixture (stream 6) is sent to a solid-liquid separator (S-1) for purification. In this solid-liquid separator (S-1), the insoluble humins and other byproducts derived from cellulose are removed using activated carbon to prevent deactivation of the catalyst owing to the residual humins in the subsequent catalytic reaction [18]. Small amounts of liquid components, such as LA, FA, and formaldehyde, are carried on the surface of insoluble humins and gypsum [10]. The insoluble humins and other byproducts, which are removed, are sent to the heat and power generation block for the production of steam and electricity (stream 7). After the HMF-LGO mixture is purified (stream 8), it is fed to the hydrogenation reactor (R-3). In this reactor, HMF and LGO are converted into THFDM (100%) and Lgol (100%), respectively, in an H2-rich environment (H2/HMF-LGO molar ratio = 10) over Ni/SiO2 catalyst at 353 K and 68.0 atm. A small amount of THF is decomposed into 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) (0.1%) and cellulose-derived furfural (FF) is converted into tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) (100%). The unreacted H2 in stream 9, which also includes a small amount of other components, is effectively recovered (99%) via expansion by introducing two vapor-liquid separators (S-2 and S-3) and is recompressed back to the hydrogenation reactor (R-3) via two compressors (CP-2 and CP-3). The mixture of THFDM and Lgol (stream 25) is separated from THF in the evaporator (S-4) where 99.9% of the THF is recovered and recycled back to the reactor (R-1) for reuse in reactions. A small amount of impurities (stream 22) is vented to prevent their accumulation by introducing an additional vapor-liquid separator (S-5). The liquid stream (stream 25), which consists of THFDM and Lgol, is mixed with H2O from the wastewater treatment block and is adjusted to 5% loading in H2O before it is injected into the hydrogenolysis reactor (R-4). The mixture of THFDM and Lgol is then simultaneously converted into 1,6-HDO in an H2-rich environment (H2/THFDM-Lgol molar ratio = 10) over Pt-WOx/TiO2 catalyst at 433 K and 54.4 atm. The unreacted H2 remaining in the product stream (stream 30) is recovered using a vapor-liquid separator (S-6) with expansion and recompressed back to the hydrogenolysis reactor (R-4). After the production of 1,6-HDO, the product stream (stream 33) is sent to a solid-liquid separator (S-7) for the removal of the humins derived from THFDM and Lgol. The separated humins (stream 34) are sent to the heat and power generation block. Finally, 1,6-HDO is recovered through two distillation columns (D-1 and D-2). The majority of H2O (99.9%), which is used in the hydrogenolysis reaction, is separated at the top of the first distillation column (D-1), and then 1,6-HDO is obtained at the bottom of the second distillation column (D-2) with a purity of 99%. The product stream contains a trace amount of 1,5-HDO, which has similar structure and properties to those of 1,6-HDO."
4,Heat integration,"2.3 Heat integration In our strategy, 353.5 MW of heat energy is required to process 900 ton of cellulose per day. The energy content of biomass residues and biogas is calculated to be 104.1 MW and 31.6 MW, respectively, based on the net heating value of each stream [23,24]. The energy content of biogas is calculated by assuming that 41% of the carbon in wastewater is converted to carbon in biogas through anaerobic digestion [25]. The total energy of 135.7 MW is sent to the heat and power generation block. Assuming the efficiency of the boiler to be 71% [26], it produces 96.3 MW of energy. Therefore, external energy sources are needed to supply the additional 257.4 MW of energy. Hence, the potential bottleneck of the proposed process is its significant energy requirement, particularly in the 1,6-HDO recovery (171.4 MW, 48.5% of the total heating requirement) and HMF/LGO production (145.7 MW, 41.2% of the total heating requirement) blocks, owing to the heating of a large amount of THF-H2O solvent. To overcome these challenges and reduce the energy requirements, we perform heat integration by designing a heat exchanger network involving the integration of the hot and cold process streams (See Figs. B1–B2 in Supplementary Material). Fig. 2(a) shows the results before and after heat integration. After performing heat integration, the heating requirement significantly decreases from 353.5 MW to 27.9 MW (92.1% reduction), thereby eliminating the need for purchase of additional primary sources (such as natural gas) for the production of heat and electricity. Furthermore, the energy requirement for cooling is reduced from 476.3 MW to 150.6 MW (68.4% reduction). Fig. 2(b) shows ten major heat loads in the designed heat exchanger network, including heating and cooling requirements. The largest heat load of 114.8 MW occurs between streams 35 and 40 of the 1,6-HDO recovery block. These large variations before and after heat integration can be achieved by introducing a heat pump (CP-6), which elevates the outlet temperature of the cooler (C-1) so that the energy required for heating at low temperatures can be covered by condensation of the top product of D-1. Heat pumps have been widely used in industries to recover energy and improve energy efficiency [27]. Although the use of heat pumps requires an additional compression step that leads to an increase in equipment and electricity costs, it reduces the overall heating requirement [28]. Thus, the use of heat pumps is preferred in integrated chemical processes with many energy-intensive units, including reboilers in distillation columns [29]. In this work, 325.6 MW of heating energy recovered by heat integration, the amount recovered by the heat pump (CP-6) is 156.9 MW, of which 133.7 MW is used for the reboiler of D-1 and 23.2 MW for R-1 as shown in Fig. 2(b)."
5,Results,
6,Capital and operating costs,"3.1 Capital and operating costs The capital and operating costs of all the process blocks in our strategy are shown in Tables 2 and 3 . The total installed cost is calculated to be $295.0 million, as shown in Table 2 (See Table C2 in Supplementary Material for detailed total installed cost). The majority of the total installed cost is attributed to the high cost of the dehydration reactor used in the HMF/LGO production (36.0% of total installed cost). The next highest cost is incurred in the heat and power generation block owing to the high boiler ($45.4 million, 15.4% of total installed cost) and turbo-generator costs ($11.6 million, 3.9% of total installed cost), which are scaled based on the energy content of the biomass residues and biogas (135.7 MW) and electricity generated (23.2 MW), respectively. Notably, the wastewater treatment block has a high cost (15.0% of total installed cost). This is owing to the high chemical oxygen demand and large flow rate of wastewater caused by the large amount of biomass degradation products. The total capital investment is computed to be $550.6 million from the sum of fixed capital investment including total direct cost (warehouse, site development, and additional piping) and total indirect cost (prorated expenses, field expenses, home office, construction fee, project contingency, etc.), land cost, and working capital. The total operating cost is calculated to be $191.8 million/year, as shown in Table 3 (See Table C3 in Supplementary Material for detailed variable operating cost). The feedstock cost accounts for the largest proportion of the total operating cost (64.1% of the total operating cost). The THF-makeup cost accounts for the next largest portion of the total operating cost (17.2% of the total operating cost), because a large amount of THF is used in the dehydration reactor to adjust the cellulose loading in the THF solvent. Although a large amount of H2 is used in hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, the H2 make-up cost contributes less significantly (6.7% of the total operating cost), because the effective separation block that uses vapor-liquid separators via expansion is designed to recover unreacted H2."
7,Pioneer plant analysis,"3.2 Pioneer plant analysis A pioneer plant analysis is performed to identify the sources of cost growth and related performance shortfalls, and to obtain more realistic estimates of the final costs and performance of this first-of-its-kind process plant [30]. For this analysis, several parameters and equations are used to calculate the plant performance and cost growth based on the statistical regression of industrial data, as shown in Table 4 . The project contingency is set at 30%, which is higher than that commonly used in the nth plant (10%), to consider additional construction uncertainties. In the pioneer plant analysis, a case study is performed for probable and pessimistic cases to account for a wider range of risks and unexpected situations, following the approaches and assumptions used in the NREL report [31]. The parameters WASTE and IMPURITIES indicate how waste and impurities affect the pioneer plant. For the probable and pessimistic cases, WASTE is assigned 2 and 3, and IMPURITIES is assigned 3 and 5, respectively, to indicate tendency. Parameters other than WASTE and IMPURITIES are assigned the same value for both cases after the process is developed. If the plant performance fails to reach 40% of its capacity after one year from the initial start-up date, it will be difficult for it to reach its design capacity without significant capital investment [30]. According to the pioneer plant analysis, for the probable and pessimistic cases, the proposed process achieves 20.9% and 16.7% capacity, respectively, after one year and nameplate capacity after 9 years and 10 years, respectievely, from the initial start-up date. The major reasons for the low plant performance are the new blocks (i.e., blocks 1–4 in Fig. 1) employed in this process and the use of solid feedstock, as expressed in Eq. 1. Therefore, a significant capital investment is required for the pioneer plant to achieve full capacity. Cost growth is calculated as 0.46 and 0.42, respectively, for the probable and pessimistic cases using Eq. 2. Based on the calculated plant performance and cost growth, total capital investment and total operating cost can be calculated for the probable and pessimistic cases of the pioneer plant (See Table C4 in Supplementary Material). In Table 2, the total capital investments in the pioneer plant in the probable and pessimistic cases are 2.5 and 2.7 times, respectively, higher than that of the nth plant. However, the total operating costs of the pioneer plant in the probable and pessimistic cases do not deviate much from that of the nth plant as shown in Table 3. This is because, although the fixed operating costs increase, the variable operating costs decrease as plant performance decreases."
8,Minimum selling price,"3.3 Minimum selling price The MSP of 1,6-HDO is calculated based on the capital and operating costs using the discounted cash flow analysis used in the NREL report [19] (See Table D1 in Supplementary Material). Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the revenues and costs of the nth plant with those of the pioneer plant in each of the probable and pessimistic cases. The MSP of the nth plant in the proposed process is computed to be $5282/ton. The MSP of the pioneer plant is determined to be $9690/ton and $10,936/ton in the probable and pessimistic cases, respectively. The MSP of each pioneer plant is 1.8 and 2.1 times higher than that of the nth plant, respectively. The large difference between the MSP of the nth plant and the pioneer plant is due to the difference in the cost of the average return on investment (ROI). The Sankey diagram shown in Fig. 4 illustrates the cost contribution per process block (HMF/LGO production, THFDM/Lgol production, 1,6-HDO production, and 1,6-HDO recovery) and the carbon flow and energy flow of the proposed process. The main cost contributor is the HMF/LGO production block owing to its high feedstock ($2372.2/ton, 46.2% of total cost) and dehydration reactor costs ($290.6/ton, 5.7% of total cost). The next highest cost contributor is the THFDM/Lgol production block primarily owing to the high THF make-up cost ($663.5/ton, 12.9% of total cost) to regulate the 3% cellulose loading in the THF solvent. Fig. 4 also shows the carbon and energy flows per process block. The overall carbon yield from cellulose to 1,6-HDO is 23.1%. The remaining carbon of cellulose is mostly degraded to humins (56.2%), which are combusted to provide heat and electricity to the process. The effect of carbon efficiency on the MSP of 1,6-HDO is further investigated in Section 3.4. The total energy efficiency of the process, calculated as the ratio of the energy content of biomass to the energy content of 1,6-HDO, is estimated to be 32.0%. A total of 136 MW of energy (84.0%) is collected in the heat and power generation block. Heat and electricity are produced with efficiencies of 71% and 24%, respectively, and used in the process."
9,Sensitivity analysis,"3.4 Sensitivity analysis A single-point sensitivity analysis for the nth plant is conducted using several economic and process parameters. Each variable is varied within a maximum and/or minimum value with all other factors being held constant. The sensitivity of the MSP of 1,6-HDO is represented as a tornado chart in Fig. 5 . The THF recovery has the largest impact on the MSP of 1,6-HDO. If THF recovery decreases by 1.9%, the MSP of 1,6-HDO dramatically increases from $5282/ton to $11,218/ton. The reason for this large variation is that the cost of THF make-up is high ($663.5/ton) and a considerably large amount of THF is used in the HMF/LGO production. In addition to the factors associated with solvent recovery, the yield of 1,6-HDO from THFDM/Lgol has a significant impact on the MSP of 1,6-HDO. If this parameter increases to 80%, the MSP of 1,6-HDO decreases to $4055/ton, which can sufficiently compete with the current petroleum-derived 1,6-HDO ($4400/ton). If the feedstock price decreases from $450/ton to $300/ton, the MSP of 1,6-HDO significantly decreases to $4458/ton-1,6-HDO, which too can compete with the current market price of 1,6-HDO ($4400/ton). If the overall product yield increases from 23.1% to 40%, the MSP of 1,6-HDO decreases to $4714/ton-1,6-HDO. The parameters associated with conversion yields are closely related to the production costs as they affect the production rate of the final product as well as the capital and operating costs. When the price of H2 increases from $1.4/kg to $4.0/kg, it has no significant effect on the MSP of 1,6-HDO because the effective separation block is designed to recover and recycle the unreacted H2."
10,Conclusions,"A new process for the production of 1,6-HDO from cellulose is developed by introducing multiple catalytic conversions with effective separation blocks for recycling THF and H2 as well as for recovering 1,6-HDO. After performing heat integration, a significantly large amount of energy is recovered by introducing a heat pump. A pioneer plant analysis is performed to estimate the cost growth and plant performance shortfalls involved in the construction and operation of the newly developed process. The outcome of the pioneer plant analysis allows us to provide estimates of risk and uncertainty for such a first-of-its-kind plant to developers. Through the sensitivity analysis, we show that although the MSP of 1,6-HDO ($5282/ton) calculated in this study is higher than the current market price of 1,6-HDO ($4400/ton), the economics of the proposed process can be improved by upgrading the reaction yield. Moreover, we find that the solvent separation block plays an important role in determining the economic feasibility of the proposed process. If the overall product yield can be increased from 23.1% to 40%, the MSP of 1,6-HDO can be reduced to as low as $4714/ton. Finally, we note that the process developed can be integrated with other chemical production processes associated with other biomass fractions, such as hemicellulose (for conversion into 1,5-pentanediol, for instance) and lignin (for conversion into carbon fibers, for instance)."
