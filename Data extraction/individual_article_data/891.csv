0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a very important element for needs of chemical industry, oil and biorefinery, and also has a perspective to be used as a clean energy carrier. It can be produced from a number of sources, such as water, hydrocarbons, biomass, hydrogen sulfide, boron hydrides and hydrides of other elements. However, predominantly hydrogen is produced from natural gas by steam methane reforming (SMR), which seems to be the most cost effective method (Easterbrook and Farr, 2013). The main drawback is that high temperature is needed for this endothermic reaction. SMR does not eliminate carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere, which affects negatively the overall life cycle of H2 generation. Hydrogen is of critical importance for production of biofuels, which require relatively high amount of hydrogen co-feeding due to a large content of oxygen and unsaturated bounds presenting in the feed. Representative examples of such processes are hydrotreatment or hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oxygenates, where H2 consumption rate depends on the feedstock (Anthonykutty, 2015). Thus 5mol of H2 are required to produce one mole of the so-called green diesel range components n-C18 from tall oil derived linoleic acid. Hydrotreatment of rapeseed oil triglycerides requires even higher H2 input of 7–16mol depending on dominating pathway (hydrodeoxygenation or decarboxylation) (Easterbrook and Farr, 2013). These values contribute to approximately 4–13wt%. of hydrogen consumption on biofuel capacity basis. The integrated catalytic processing of maple wood to fuel range alkanes requires approximately 9% H2 charge (Bond et al., 2014). Historically, most manufacturers involved in biomass hydroprocessing either generate on-site hydrogen using SMR or purchase it in the liquid or gaseous forms (Easterbrook and Farr, 2013). Costs of H2 become critical at locations where reliable natural gas supply is unavailable or cumbersome. There is a large number of alternative methods to generate hydrogen from more sustainable sources by, for example, biomass processing, electrolysis of water, solar-thermal and photoelectrochemical water splitting and biological pathways. At the current state-of-the-art high-pressure electrolysis efficiencies, the costs of hydrogen are 2–4$/kg based on the price of electricity, generated from fossil fuels (State-of-the-art Hydrogen Production Cost Estimate Using Water Electrolysis, 2009). The disadvantage of this method is high electricity power consumption. Thus, 30MW power is required for 500kg/h of H2 production. The most straightforward biomass-to-hydrogen route is gasification coupled with the water–gas shift reaction (WGS). However, a more efficient method of thermo-chemical H2 production seems to be fast pyrolysis of biomass followed by catalytic reforming of the liquid pyrolysis product. The highest yield of hydrogen from bio-oil is 12.9kg H2/100kg bio-oil, which corresponds to 80% of the stoichiometric potential (Czernik and French, 2014). Another promising technology to generate hydrogen is aqueous phase reforming (APR) of polyols. In comparison with high temperature steam reforming, APR requires much lower temperatures allowing a decrease of energy consumption needed for hydrogen (Liu, 2008; Davda et al., 2005; Coronado et al., 2016). Milder reaction conditions (225–250°C, 30–50bar) eliminate severe water evaporation requirements and also allow generation of additional hydrogen via the WGS reaction. A key advantage of APR is that it enables flexibility in choosing the source of hydrogen supplied to the plant. The method allows utilization of a wide range of substrates: alcohols and polyols, including, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, xylitol, mannitol, galactitol and sorbitol. It is advantageous for an industrial process, where the feedstock can be a mixture of various compounds. APR is also considered as a method of in-situ hydrogen formation in complex biomass to fuel processing (Huber et al., 2004; Lange et al., 2010). The state of catalytic aqueous-phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons has been summarized in the recent reviews of Coronado et al. (2016) and Davda et al. (2005). Based on available information only Virent Energy Systems Inc. has claimed to be commercializing the APR process for hydrogen production from sorbitol and glucose (Coronado et al., 2016; Cortright and Blommel, 2013). It was suggested (Cortright, 2005) that hydrogen could be generated from commercial grade sorbitol at a cost of approximately $4/kg. Published (Cortright, 2005; Davis et al., 1999; Perez et al., 2014) economical analysis of H2 production by APR included, however, only a brief discussion on the details on energy consumption, process optimization and design. The present work is aimed to fill this gap by determining process and economic parameters, influencing hydrogen costs. The sorbitol syrup was selected as a feedstock for production of 500kg/h of hydrogen. The capacity was selected based on an estimated amount needed for 100000t of green diesel annual production from tall oil. Such facilities have been recently installed in Finland (Laurikko et al., 2014). A detailed simulation was done using Aspen HYSYS. A new feature in the simulations was consideration of in-situ phase equilibrium for the reactor heat demand calculations not previously described in connection with APR. The process optimization included several conceptual improvements (i.e. middle pressure steam co-generation and hot water recycle), which can significantly decrease the operation costs."
1,APR reactor design,
2,Simulation of APR reactions,"2.1 Simulation of APR reactions For the process evaluation, the mass balances for the liquid and gas-phase components are required. Moreover, the model should correspond to the experimentally determined product composition. The reaction network of polyols APR is very complex comprising a multitude of reactions, which may occur depending on the nature of the catalyst, support, feed, and process conditions. The scheme of the main reaction pathways, based on the product analysis, is displayed in Fig. 1 . The main reaction is indirect CC bond breaking of polyols by dehydrogenation/decarbonylation steps forming H2 and CO, which takes part in the subsequent WGS reaction. Elimination of CO results in the formation of polyol species with a shorter carbon skeleton compared to sorbitol (xylitol, glycerol and ethylene glycol) (Kirilin et al., 2012). As mentioned above CO can further undergo WGS reaction forming CO2 and additional H2. Pathways of hydrogen consumption include direct hydrogenation or dehydration of CO bonds, which is followed by hydrogenation of the formed olefins (Godina et al., 2015). Alkanes are the products of those types of bond cleavage. A wide variety of products is formed in APR with the gas phase mainly composed of H2, CO2 and C1–C6 straight chain alkanes. The liquid phase products include different alcohols, diols, polyols, ketones, cyclic ethers as well as some other compounds. A detailed discussion on the liquid phase composition could be found in Kirilin et al. (2010), George and Huber (2010) and Godina et al. (2015). In the current work it was assumed that generation of the main components occurs according to the overall reactions presented in Table 1 . Products selectivity (Si) was optimized to have the gas and liquid compositions similar to experimentally observed at 100% of sorbitol conversion. The optimization was done considering the following objective function: (1) m i n [ ∑ j = 1 7 ( | C j c a l c − C j e x p | · k j w ) ] where C j c a l c , C j e x p — calculated and experimentally observed molar fraction of j-th gas component; k j w — weighting coefficient of j-th component (100 for alkanes, 1 for H2 and CO2). A high weighting factor was used for alkanes, because despite their low molar concentration, formation of alkanes can significantly influence the yield of hydrogen. Aspen HYSYS optimizer was utilized to minimize the objective function by the Box method. The model adjustment was done using experimental data for APR of 3.6wt% aqueous solution of sorbitol over 1%Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at 225°C and 29.7bar. In the published work (Godina et al., 2015) describing the details of the experimental procedure, selectivity to the gas and liquid phase components was reported at 62% sorbitol conversion. For the purpose of the current work, it was decided to use the experimental data generated at 100% conversion, which were not reported previously and are presented in Tables 2 and 3 . Total conversion of polyol corresponded to 0.25kg sorbitol per kg of catalyst per hour. The catalyst showed a stable performance with insignificant deactivation after 160h. During optimization selectivities to liquid products (Reactions 7–25) were adjusted to obtain similar carbon distribution across liquid range components and the experimentally found carbon content in the liquid phase equal to 36.59%. A comparison between calculated and experimental data of product composition and carbon distribution is also given in Tables 2 and 3. The largest discrepancy between the experimental and calculated data was below 17% with the highest values obtained for methanol, n-hexane, acetone and fumaric acid. A relative error for the hydrogen mole fraction among the gaseous products was 3%. The liquid products of APR often comprise a complex mixture of carbohydrates and various oxygenates (Kirilin et al., 2010; George and Huber, 2010). In fact more than 250 intermediates with 19 major compounds were detected (Godina et al., 2015). In the sample obtained at 100% sorbitol conversion 25 out of 38 peaks were identified constituting 62.3mol% of carbon. Consideration of the liquid phase determination by HPLC allowed establishing a clear trend of more oxidized compounds formation along with conversion increase. A finite number of components had to be chosen to simulate the reactor performance, and, moreover, unidentified components were to a largest extent distributed between the ethanol, pentanediol, acetoin, levulinic acid and ethyl acetoacetate. This is related to a high probability that unidentified compounds are С4–С6 diols–triols and С4–С6 compounds with carbonyl and carboxyl groups containing also one or few hydroxyls. Subsequently acetoin, levulinic acid and ethyl acetoacetate were added to Table 3 while calculating the liquid phase components. Enthalpy changes of a particular reaction ΔH25°C in Table 1 were calculated using the enthalpy of formation for H2, CO2 and C1–C6 alkanes, taken at the gaseous state, while other components were considered in the liquid state. The values of ΔHf for liquid state components were calculated by Eq. (2) and can be found in the Supporting information (Table S1): (2) Δ H f , liq = Δ H f , gas − Δ H vap The values of gas state enthalpy of formation ΔHf,gas and enthalpy of vaporization ΔHvap were taken from Aspen HYSYS and are quite consistent with NIST data base (NIST). The largest discrepancy in ΔHf,liq equal to 7% for sorbitol and 9% for fumaric acid can be due to differences in the heats of evaporation ΔHvap of complex oxygen containing compounds. Discrepancy in ΔHf,liq for all other liquid phase compounds does not exceed 4%. While the exothermic side reactions were making a significant contribution to theoverall enthalpy change of the system, the resulting effect of 144kJ/mol is still endothermic."
3,Reactor thermal behavior and phase equilibrium,"2.2 Reactor thermal behavior and phase equilibrium An important point related to possibility of water evaporation must be considered in order to simulate the reactor duty. The total heat of reaction ΔHsum at the reaction temperature can be determined from: (3) Δ H s u m = Δ H r + Δ H w · e w · R w / s where ΔH r — reaction enthalpy change [kJ/mol of sorbitol]; ΔH w — enthalpy of water evaporation [kJ/mol H2O]; e w — extent of water evaporation; R w/s — water to sorbitol molar ratio. The parameter e w reflects the fraction of vaporized water. According to the theory of phase equilibria water may partially or fully vaporize, if the operating pressure is near the saturation pressure of water. This effect was just briefly discussed in the literature (Davda et al., 2005) focusing only on its influence on CO formation. The increased water content in the gas bubbles shifts WGS reaction to the products, which was also confirmed by the experimental observations (Davda et al., 2005). Profound water evaporation can give a significant contribution to the overall reactor duty. In this research the extent of water evaporation is carefully considered since it is influencing the reactor thermal behavior giving a substantial contribution to the reactor duty due to a relatively R w/s high water to sorbitol molar ratio Rw/s.The content of water in the gas phase can be easily estimated using the Raoult's law: (4) y w ⋅ P = x w ⋅ P sat ; where y w , x w are molar fraction of water in the vapor and liquid phases; P, Psat — system and H2O saturated pressure respectively [kPa]. Due to a high dilution of the reacting mixture, x w is close to 1, and the molar fraction of water can be determined by: (5) y w ∼ P sat / P ; In isothermal conditions the vapour phase water content is constant and the extent of water evaporation is determined by the quantity of gas being formed. In adiabatic conditions the produced gaseous components facilitate evaporation with a simultaneous temperature decrease due to heat consumption by water evaporation. Temperature decrease below 210°C may even almost completely stop the APR reaction. Therefore, in-situ phase equilibrium is of importance for the reactor duty calculations both for isothermal and adiabatic conditions. Unfortunately, knowledge about the thermodynamic behavior of APR is virtually nonexistent. To simulate the phase equilibrium inside the reactor a rigorous thermodynamic model based on Peng–Robinson equation of state (EOS) was used (Peng and Robinson, 1976). The results of the simulations are consistent with available experimental data (IUPAC Solubility Data Series, 1981) for a binary H2–H2O mixture at a pressure of 68.95bar (Table 4 ) even if the phase equilibrium was simulated for 24 components mixture of the reactor effluent. The main argument for using the Peng Robinson EOS to treat the phase equilibria in a complex mixture containing H2O–H2–CO2 and alkanes is absence of strong interactions between H2 and H2O, therefore at medium pressures (below 50 bars) H2–H2O mixtures as well as CO2–H2O and even more complex ones could be modelled with reasonable accuracy using this approach."
4,CO formation and conversion of recycled alcohols,"2.3 CO formation and conversion of recycled alcohols Other additional reactions were introduced into the model. (R26) CO+H2O→СO2 +H2 (R27) СH3OH+ H2O→СO2 +3·H2 (R28) С2H5OH+H2O→СH4 +СO2 +2·H2 (R29) С3H7OH+H2O→С2H6 +СO2 +2·H2 (R30) С3H6(OH)2 →С2H6 +СO2 +H2 (R31) С4H8(OH)2 +2·H2O→С2H6 +2·СO2 +4·H2 (R32) С5H10(OH)2 +2·H2 →С5H12 +2·H2O (R33) С6H12(OH)2 +2·H2 →С6H14 +2·H2O The extent of WGS is determined by thermodynamics (Reaction 26). Other reactions were related to steam reforming of methanol (Reaction 27) and other alcohols (Reactions 28–29, 31) as well as hydrodeoxygenation of diols (Reactions 30–33). Such reactions of alcohols, not incorporated during initial optimization to avoid overparametrization, have been included in the model because typically alcohols, formed in the liquid phase, have a nonreactive methyl group at the end and less reactive secondary hydroxyl groups. According to this model recycling of C2–C6 components to the APR reactor will result in their complete transformations to alkanes while methanol maybe selectively transformed to hydrogen. Conversion per pass for the Reaction steps 27–33 was assumed to be 100% as reactivity of shorter chain oxygen containing compounds is similar to that of C6 polyols (Tokarev et al., 2010). Fig. 2 features the entire model of isothermal APR in Aspen HYSYS. The calculation procedure involves a sequence of catalytic reactors determined by kinetics or thermodynamics (so-called Gibbs type reactors). The first reactor transforms recycled C2–C6 alcohols according to Reactions 27–33 satisfying specification set value of 100% conversion. Sorbitol APR is simulated by the second conversion-type reactor (Table 1) and the third Gibbs-type reactor simulates the equilibrium reaction of carbon monoxide WGS. For each stage the heat duty is calculated assuming phase equilibrium of output streams. Utilization of three reactors is just a convenient simulation procedure for modeling of complex reaction networks in this software. Summarizing, the model is based on: 1. Stoichiometric conversion of sorbitol using a simplified network of reforming reactions (Table 1) 2. Water–gas shift reaction being at the chemical equilibrium; 3. In-situ phase equilibrium of the vapour and liquid phases; 4. Conversion of recycled alcohols reacting 100% per pass giving alkanes, СO2 and hydrogen. 5. Independence of selectivity on the reaction temperature, pressure, feed dilution and WHSV. The assumption on the independence of selectivity on temperature oversimplifies the treatment of APR process while in fact the former can be improved at higher temperature (Coronado et al., 2016)."
5,Determination of optimal reaction conditions,"2.4 Determination of optimal reaction conditions In this study the pT-conditions and feed dilution were considered only for determination of their influence on water evaporation and the reactor heat duty calculations. The developed HYSYS reactor model was utilized for this purpose. At a fixed sorbitol feed content of 10wt% (R w/s =91mol H2O/mol sorbitol) and pressure 30bar a temperature increase from 210 to 225°C results in a rapid increase of water evaporation from 19.5 to 61.6 % and two and a half times higher heat duty (Fig. 3 a,b). Such elevated heat duty value is required to sustain the reactor at isothermal condition. Pressure elevation to 50bar allows to reduce the extent of water evaporation from 61.6 to 12.2 % (at 225°C). Therefore, application of higher pressure may reduce the reactor heat duty in isothermal conditions and the total heat of the reaction stays practically constant as shown in Fig. 3d. Another important parameter is sorbitol concentration. A higher sorbitol content at the reactor inlet results in more gas formation which facilitates water evaporation to sustain its partial pressure (Fig. 3c). According to Eq. (4) such evaporation can be, however, compensated by R w/s decreasing H2O/sorbitol ratio Rw/s. At 30bar (starting from the sorbitol content of 15wt%) water is entirely evaporated and the total heat of the reaction is decreased to the level, equal to the one at higher pressure (from 1800 to 578kJ/mol). It should be noted that in case of substantial water evaporation, decomposition and caramelization of sorbitol would be expected completely deactivating the catalyst. Thus, at 30bar the optimal way for considering full water evaporation is to use the sorbitol content higher than 30wt%. The feed concentration should be selected taking into account solubility of polyols in water (Yalkowsky and Yan, 2003). Application of higher pressures allows using a more concentrated reactor feed. Feed dilution also affects the temperature change at adiabatic conditions as shown in Fig. 4 . The excess of water works as a heat source for compensating the endothermic effect of the reaction. According to the simulations it is possible to operate an APR reactor adiabatically only below 5wt% sorbitol concentration. In this case the adiabatic temperature change is 22–29°C. For example, at 50bar and the input temperature of 250°C, the output temperature is 227°C. The APR reactions are known to proceed at feasible rates in this temperature range. A higher sorbitol content in the feed requires the inter-stage heating or hot water injection."
6,Reactor type selection,"2.5 Reactor type selection A principle reactor design should be selected to estimate the capital costs. Scaling up of experimental data is typically a complex problem being solved by rigorous simulations and pilot-scale investigations. Our simulations are based on one experimental study (Godina et al., 2015) carried out in a laboratory scale tubular packed-bed reactor (4.6mm ID) with constant nitrogen co-feeding during the reaction. Gas co-feeding increases sorbitol conversion and selectivity to hydrogen as demonstrated in a microchannel reactor (Neira et al., 2014). This approach leads to the removal of forming hydrogen from the catalyst to the gas phase and, hence, H2 consumption in the side reactions is decreasing. Thus co-feeding ratio was proposed to be in the range 1–3m3 N2/m3 liquid (Neira et al., 2014). At the same time the inert gas co-feeding being practical in laboratory scale experiments, has a number of disadvantages in industrial conditions such as additional heat duty requirements, recycle gas compression, and difficulties to separate N2 from the products. In general, such components as alkanes and CO2 can be considered as alternatives to nitrogen. These components are formed in APR and can be separated using pressure swing adsorption or membrane methods. Another co-feeding gas typically utilized in laboratory scale experiments is hydrogen, however, its application promotes hydrogenation of oxygenated hydrocarbons leading to alkanes formation. While alkanes are produced in so-called APHD process with hydrogen co-feeding (George and Huber, 2010), in the current study they are considered as side products, with the desired being hydrogen. The residence time and the flow regimes of the two-phase fluid have an important effect on the APR process performance. The hydrogen production in APR is limited by diffusion of the gas molecules from the catalyst surface, and through the liquid phase. Performance parameters of different reactor types for APR were for the first time considered by Coronado et al. (2016). Intensified reactors were selected as promising ways to overcome operational challenges such as mass transfer limitations and selective hydrogen removal. Among conventional reactors the packed-bed was selected as a suitable APR in majority of the studies (Coronado et al., 2016). Packed-bed reactors can operate in different modes with the down-flow and up-flow of the liquid and gases, and the gas can flow either co- or counter-current. Each design significantly affects the process results. The concurrent down-flow reactor is typically utilized for APR in laboratory scale experiments. In this case the advantages are: lower-energy input, and absence of fluidization (Murzin, 2013). The up-flow design is supposed to have certain advantages for sorbitol APR. Besides a better liquid distribution, heat dissipation, surface wetting and easier heat exchange it provides better hydrogen removal from the reactor by rising gas bubbles. Gas bubbles velocity is high in relation to the up-flow liquid velocity. As a consequence, the residence time of hydrogen is decreased resulting in lower H2 consumption in side reactions. Another important parameter for the reactor type selection is the adiabatic temperature difference. For sorbitol APR it depends on the feed dilution and varies in the range between 10°C and 150°C (Fig. 4). For such values multitubular or multibed reactors can be used with heaters or hot water injection (Fig. 6a) between the beds. In this work a multitubular plug flow reactor (Fig. 5 c) was selected as the base design option for capital costs estimation of the reactor, while it is certainly premature to claim that tubular reactor is the most efficient one for APR."
7,Costs estimation and process simulation procedures,"2.6 Costs estimation and process simulation procedures The aim of the techno-economical analysis was to estimate the total costs of hydrogen production including both operational costs and required capital investment to APR reaction area, hydrogen purification and utilities. The process is designed to produce 500kg/h of hydrogen from the sorbitol syrup. All the calculated values of heat consumption or costs are referred to this specific hydrogen capacity. The estimation of costs was done based on the approach widely used for similar purposes (Towler and Sinnott, 2008). The total costs of production (TCOP) were calculated as the sum of variable costs of production (VCOP), also referred as operating costs, fixed costs of production (FCOP) and annual capital charge(ACC) (Towler and Sinnott, 2008): (6) TCOP = VCOP + FCOP + ACC (7) ACC = FCI ⋅ ACCR here FCI—fixed capital investment [$]; ACCR—annual capital charge ratio. Fixed capital investments are based on the estimation of the purchase costs of the main equipment, the other costs are estimated as factors of the total equipment cost. Fixed capital investment includes the offsite costs (5% of ISBL), engineering costs (30% of ISBL) and contingency charges (30% of ISBL). Annual capital charge ratio was equal to 0.199 corresponding to the typical cost of capital of 15% and a plant life time of 10 years. The purchased equipment costs C PE were estimated based on the process simulation data and can be calculated using the correlations of the following form: (8) C P E = ( a + b * S n ) · f m where a, b—cost constants; S—size parameter; n—exponent; f m —material cost factor relative to plain carbon steel. Constants for the Eq. (8) were taken from (Towler and Sinnott, 2008) where the purchased equipment costs are referred to U.S. Gulf Coast basis, January 2006 (CE index=478.6). The materials cost factor of 1.3 (accounts to SS316 steel) was utilized only for the reactor area equipment. The installed equipment costs were estimated using the Hand’s installing factors f i (4 for pumps and vessels; 3.5 for exchangers; 2.5 for compressors (Towler and Sinnott, 2008)) and adjusted to 2014year by using the CE index of 575. The equation for installed equipment costs is: (9) C I E = C P E · f i · ( 575 / 478.6 ) The APR reactor costs were estimated like the heat exchangers with a multiplication factor of 1.2. Catalyst costs were assumed to be 50$/kg. The costs of Pt metal were not included due to a possibility of its recovery and full costs compensation after the end of the catalyst lifetime. In the absence of reliable data on catalyst stability it can be tentatively assumed, that the catalyst replacement occurs every 3 years. In fact, this is conservative estimation and the catalyst lifetime can be even longer. The required amount of the heterogeneous catalyst was calculated based on available experimental data. Fixed costs include: operating labor (3 shift positions, 150000$ on annual basis), supervision (25% of operating labor), direct salary overhead (50% of the operating labor) and maintenance (5% of ISBL investment). Variable costs of production were determined for 8000h of operation per year with the following cost factors:12.7$/t for high pressure steam (26.5$/MWh); 7.9$/t for medium pressure steam (22.4$/MWh); 15$/MWh for external supplied heating utility (4.4$/mmbtu); 1.5$/MWh for cooling water; 56$/MWh for electricity; 3$/t for waste water treatment and 0.05$/nm3 for nitrogen gas. The sorbitol feedstock price was set at 650$/t (dry basis) according to the present situation on the market (E4tech, RE-CORD and WUR). Additional revenues of steam co-generation were taken as a credit and included in the VCOP. Specific hydrogen cost is referred in units $/kg and was calculated by dividing the TCOP on annual H2 production. This process simulation was carried out using Aspen HYSYS software with Peng–Robinson property basis. Process units were simulated using assumptions described in Table 5 ."
8,"Hydrogen purification, compression and utility system design","2.7 Hydrogen purification, compression and utility system design APR gas phase products are rich in carbon dioxide that must be separated to yield a pure hydrogen product (99.999%). CO2 content is typically (Cortright et al., 2002) higher than 30mol%. This separation can be done by absorption (scrubbing), pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or membrane technologies (Davda et al., 2005). Absorption methods use physical (potash, PEGE, methanol) or chemical solvents, such as amines (MEA, MDEA, aMDEA) allowing removal of only CO2 down to 30–50ppm alkanes and CO remain in the final product resulting in H2content of 90–98%. The PSA unit seems to be the most efficient method for hydrogen purification in APR process. PSA units typically have 4–16 beds consisting of adsorbents layers (alumina, silica gel, activated carbon or zeolites). The PSA tail gas contains CO2, alkanes and a certain amount of slipped H2 being determined by the recovery rate (typical 85–95%). A higher rate of H2 recovery requires more beds and leads to an increase of the capital costs. The advantages of such method are efficient carbon monoxide removal (down to 10ppm content) and a low pressure change for the purified gas. The disadvantage of PSA is that the tail gas will have a low heating value (below 6000kJ/kg) due to a high CO2 content. Combustion of such gas requires special burners or co-feeding of high calorific gas. The latter approach is used in state-of-art SMR plants with PSA units (Meyers, 2003). A Pd alloy membrane is also suggested for APR (Davda et al., 2005), requiring, however, higher capital costs and additional hydrogen compression to compensate a relatively low back pressure (up to 20bar) for a H2 rich stream. In this work, the PSA unit with 85% H2 recovery was selected. A cost correlation for PSA unit was adopted from the published data (Commercialization of the HYMELT Gasification Process for Illinois coal William Renner, 2002) where the purchase price (2003) of UOP Polybed skid mounted units with different capacity was quoted from the vendor. With assumption of an installing factor of 1.2 and the exponent equal to 0.8 the resultant cost for PSA correlation is: (10) C P S A = ( 447 846 + 3407 · G H 2 0.8 ) · 1.2 · ( 575 / 402 ) where G H2—hydrogen production rate [kg/h], C PSA —installed cost for the PSA unit. In some cases the required pressure of hydrogen can be as high as 150bar. The estimated power for 500kg/h H2 compression from 50 to 150bar is 300kW resulting in approximately 0.034$/kg hydrogen cost increase. This cost was not considered in the final analysis. The utility system design is also of importance. Heating by high pressure (HP) steam can be considered as the most convenient method for APR. The temperature at which heat is released can be precisely controlled via controlling the steam pressure. This enables a tight temperature control important in APR to prevent reactor overheating and catalyst deactivation. The selected steam pressure is 41bar, corresponding to a condensing temperature of 253°C that should be enough for the reaction temperature of 225°C. The energy contained in PSA tail gas can be used as a feed to the HP steam boiler. In some designed cases the missing amount of energy can be covered by an external heating source."
9,Process overview,"2.8 Process overview The process described in this study uses sorbitol syrup with 70wt% of polyol content as the feedstock, which is currently produced in significant amounts by hydrogenation of glucose. Moreover, recently there is a growing interest in direct hydrogenation of cellulose to sorbitol (Kobayashi et al., 2011). The base case process flow diagram is displayed in Fig. 7 containing also simulation data. A mixture of the feedstock, the sweep gas — nitrogen, make-up and recycling water is heated to a near-reaction temperature in a feed-effluent heat exchanger, then heated up to the reaction temperature by high pressure steam (HPS) and directed to the APR tubular reactor. Nitrogen co-feeding ratio was selected as 2nm3 N2/m3 liquid at the reactor inlet (Neira et al., 2014). The reactor is supplied by HP steam to sustain the isothermal conditions. The reactor product stream, consisting of aqueous and gas phases, is cooled in the feed-effluent heat exchanger and water cooler down to 30°C to separate the gaseous product and to direct it to PSA unit. A fraction of the recycled water can be drawn to waste water treatment in order to prevent accumulation of relatively stable liquid components in the recycle such as acids and furans. The PSA tail gas with pressure below 3bar is combusted in the boiler to generate HP steam which is then supplied to the reactor and preheater. The excess of HP steam can provide extra income. In cases of a highly diluted feed, as shown below, the amount of tail gas is not enough to cover the reactor heat duty, therefore an external heating utility is required. The base case design has several opportunities for modification. The first one is related to water recycle. The reactor effluent is in two phase conditions, therefore it is possible to separate the unreacted hot water before cooling and to recycle it back to the reactor inlet. As a result a flowrate and corresponding duties of the preheater and the effluent heat exchanger can be decreased. A hot temperature separator (HTS) or a special reactor design with a separation zone can be applied (Fig. 5b). Another way of optimization is to use the hot reactor effluent as a heat source for medium pressure (MP) steam generation. An insignificant increase of effluent heat exchanger duty will be fully compensated by revenues from utility cogeneration. The selected MP steam parameters are 13bar and 190°C. Simulation data of the considered designs, based on 10wt% sorbitol feed, are shown in Fig. 8 . The detailed process streams data can be found in the Supporting information (Table S2) and the material balance is given in Table 6 . The optimization allows co-generation of additional 8.3t/h MP stream."
10,Results and discussion,"The design option which have been considered in this work were modeled using Aspen HYSYS and simulation data further utilized for approximate equipment sizing and cost calculations. The methods used in the current work are conventionally applied in costs calculations giving typically errors of ca. within ±20–30% (Towler and Sinnott, 2008). Tables 7–9 summarizes technical characteristics required for the APR reactor and auxiliary equipment, operating and fixed production costs as well as project investment costs. These data are given for 225°C and 50bar, WHSV of 0.2gsorb./gcat. h and sorbitol content at the reactor inlet of 10wt%. The major contribution to the operating costs and the corresponding specific hydrogen cost is the feedstock cost ($47.9M, 91.8%). Other operating costs (electricity and water treatment) are partially covered by the revenue of steam cogeneration. The major capital costs contribution were reactors and the catalysts charge ($4.4M, 34% of FCI), heat exchangers ($0.53M, 4.2% of FCI) and a boiler ($0.5M, 3.9% of FCI). The estimated costs of PSA unit are $1.6 million (12.5% of FCI). The total installed equipment costs for the plant were calculated to be $12.8M. Heterogeneous catalyst costs correspond to 17.9% of the total capital costs, even if costs of Pt were not included in costs calculations as explained earlier. An estimated contribution to the project investment are $17.2M for 1%Pt/Al2O3 and specified WHSV of 0.2gsorb./gcat. h. The effect of sorbitol concentration on the performance of APR is illustrated in Fig. 9 . Considering the range of 5–30wt% the costs of hydrogen do not change significantly in the range of 12.94–13.58$/kg, while the operating costs vary to a larger extent. The optimized design has lower capital costs due to a decrease of heating/cooling equipment duty and also a lower hydrogen price because of revenues from stream cogeneration. It can be assumed that the space velocity of the process can be regulated by adjusting Pt content. In this study WHSV of 0.2kgsorbitol/kgcatalyst h was utilized as the guiding basis for the reactor design giving 100% sorbitol conversion and 35.8% carbon content in liquid phase. This value is consistent with the lab scale experimental data obtained over 1%Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. For 5% Pt content keeping the same metal dispersion, catalyst loading could be probably decreased five-fold. The reactor size estimation for WHSV equal to 1kgsorbitol/kgcatalyst h is the following: Ø2.17m, Lt =6m, d t =50mm (ID), tubes number=900, F=902m2 , catalyst loading 9.2t (10.6m3). Due to a lower catalyst volume and a constant reactor heat duty a narrower tube diameter is required compared to the design at WHSV equal to 0.2kgsorbitol/kgcatalyst h. The resulting installed reactor costs were $0.9M (57% lower) and five-fold lower catalyst costs — $1.8M. While these costs changes resulted in reduction of the fixed capital investment to $7.8M (39% lower), hydrogen costs, however, did not change significantly (12.47$/kg) due to a significant contribution of the feedstock costs. As mainly the feedstock costs contribute to the hydrogen price the influence of sorbitol price on hydrogen costs at different hydrogen yields and WHSV equal to 0.2h−1 was analyzed (Fig. 10 ). The feedstock costs are considered on the dry basis. The process design in this analysis includes high temperature separation and MP steam co-generation. The H2 yield was changed by varying the main reaction selectivity (С6H14O6 +6·H2O→6·СO2+13·H2) with the corresponding proportional changes in selectivity of Reactions 7–25 to obtain 10% carbon content in the liquid phase. The case 13molH2/molsorb represents a so-called “best-case” scenario based on complete conversion of sorbitol to hydrogen without formation of liquid products and alkanes. Simulation results clearly show that the hydrogen cost below 4$/kg can be achieved using sorbitol price lower than 300$/t and H2 yield above 7.3molH2/molsorb. To compare the process with SMR performance the economic data taken from (Meyers, 2003) were used for calculation of H2 costs and specific capital cost of SMR. The cost of hydrogen produced by SMR (Meyers, 2003) is approximately 1.8$/kg (not including the catalyst costs and capital charge). To reach similar product costs the sorbitol price for APR process should be lower than 150$/t. Such low feedstock price of 150–300$/t is achievable only if sorbitol would be efficiently produced from cellulosic biomass."
11,Conclusions,"The present study was focused on detailed sorbitol aqueous phase reforming process design, which was not previously described. The emphasis was placed on process simulation and cost estimations of the major equipment (reactors, heat-exchangers, hydrogen purification unit and utilities). For reactor modelling a complex reaction network was taken into account along with phase equilibrium simulations. Model adjustment and verification were done using the experimental data over 1%Pt/Al2O3. Alcohols recycling conversion and CO formation were also introduced into the reactor model. The phase equilibrium simulations using Peng–Robinson equation of state were verified with the published experimental data for H2–H2O mixture. Phase equilibrium and water evaporation have a significant impact on the total process heat at pressures below 40bar. Such in-situ phase equilibrium has been previously overlooked. Optimal reaction conditions were determined on the basis of water evaporation and the reactor heat duty. Utilization of pressures above 40bar is reducing the heat duty of the reactor and can provide a cost-efficient operation with the diluted feed. The process optimization determines that the medium pressure steam co-generation and hot water recycle can significantly decrease the operation costs. Techno-economical analysis using Aspen HYSYS was done to design a 500kg/h hydrogen production plant operation with sorbitol syrup as a feedstock. Such scale can be required for stand-alone green diesel production plants located close to pulp mills, where hydrogen is not readily available and instalment of a small-scale methane steam reforming can be economically not attractive. The total costs of hydrogen were estimated as 13$/kg based on the current sorbitol market price (650$/t) being ca. seven fold higher than ex-works hydrogen costs from methane steam reforming. The major cost contributor is the feedstock, which accounted for 91.8% of the total hydrogen production costs. The most feasible way of making APR economical attractive is production of polyols from the lignocellulosic biomass."
