0,Introduction,"Organic synthesis catalyzed by heterogeneous metal catalysts has been extensively employed in many kinds of reactions (such as hydrogenation [1,2], oxidation [3,4], isomerization [5], coupling reaction [6], etc), and has also become a hot issue for design green chemical reactions [7–9]. Recently, research on heterogeneous catalysis is tending to focus on developing mono-dispersing or atomic-dispersed catalyst owing to the rapid development of nanotechnology [10–15]. The flourish of single-atom catalyst promotes the pursuing of ultimate conversion efficiency in catalytic system. However, there is still a huge gap for the practical application of single-atom catalyst because of complicated synthesis strategy, low-yield of catalyst, low-content of active metal and high-cost [16,17]. More importantly, the pursuit of high conversion efficiency often means sacrificing the selectivity of catalysts. In most cases, high chemo-selectivity is more impressive and worthy of attention than conversion efficiency because separation and purification are high time and energy consuming procedures in organic synthesis, especially for the system contains several substances with similar chemical bonds, such as imine and its corresponding secondary-amine. Therefore, the highly anticipated feature is developing efficient catalysts with outstanding selectivity for target products. Imines, amines and their derivatives have been regarded as very important collections of nitrogen-contained compounds in subsequent manufacturing of various organic chemicals [18–24]. For instance, statistically, over 40 % of pharmaceutical and 20 % of agrochemical ingredients are produced annually from the building blocks of imine and amines [25,26]. Traditionally, imines were typically generated through a condensation reaction between primary-amine and aldehyde catalyzed by inseparable and expensive homogeneous catalysts [27–29]. Alternatively, coupling of alcohols and primary-amines, which is realized by oxidation and condensation reactions, has been developed to synthesize corresponding imine chemicals over various heterogeneous catalysts [30–37]. The produced imine can further transform into corresponding secondary-amine by hydrogenation of CN bond in imine. As can be seen, imine and secondary-amine are formed under different reaction paths (oxidation and reduction), suggesting they should be achieved in separate catalytic systems [38–43]. More importantly, one of the substrates (primary-amine) is usually derived from directly reductive amination of aldehyde or ketone in the aid of corrosive ammonia gas [44,45]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop green technologies to selectively produce imine and secondary-amine in one-pot, and the selectivity for the two kinds of products can be smartly tuned merely by adjusting reaction conditions. This has not been implemented in an effective and green strategy. To meet these requirements, we reported a highly efficient bi-metallic catalyst which was used in catalytic tandem reaction system, where hydrogenation of aromatic nitro compounds and then coupling with aromatic aldehydes were purposefully realized to selectively synthesize imines or secondary-amines by tailoring of reaction parameters in one-pot. For hydrogen-involved catalytic reaction, nickel (Ni) based catalysts would be a favourable choice to noble metals owing to the low cost, earth abundance and considerable activity of Ni. Although the activity of metallic cobalt is not as conspicuous as nickel, it usually displays superior selectivity in selective catalytic system. Here, we demonstrated that bi-metallic NiCo deposited on metal oxide showed Co/Ni composition-dependence catalysis in hydrogenation-condensation tandem reaction system."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals All the used materials and chemicals were used directly without purification after the purchase. Metal nitrates ((Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, La(NO3)3·6H2O) were derived from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. and were used for preparing catalysts. The reactants (iso-propanol (IP), benzaldehyde (BA) and nitrobenzene (NB)) were obtained from Aladdin Reagent Company. Other analytical grade solvents including ethanol (used for washing) and n-octanol (used as internal standard for analysing products) were commercially available. The substituted reactants for extension tests, including p-/o-/m- methyl nitrobenzene, p-methyl benzaldehyde, p/o-hydroxy benzaldehyde, were also purchased from Aladdin Reagent Company. Deionized (DI) water with 18.2 MΩ resistance was used."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation A NiCo5 catalyst typically contained 2.5 wt% metal NPs (Ni + Co) with the molar ratio of 5 (Co/Ni) based on inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement. In a typical hydrothermal synthesis procedure, 2.4 g La(NO3)3·6H2O, 0.25 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.25 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved by 50 mL DI water. The mixture was treated in ultrasound for 15 min and then transferred into 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave for maintaining at 200 °C within 10 h. After completing and cooling, the sample was cleaned by DI water and ethanol for three time in a centrifuge, and then dried over night at 80 °C. The obtained light-green powder was reduced in a furnace equipped with a quartz tube at 650 °C for 4 h in 10 % H2/N2 gas to derive the NiCo5 catalyst. After reduction, the both ends of the quartz tube were closed and transferred into a vacuum glove box, where the sample were transferred to reactor for reaction or sealed into a vacuum bag for TEM, XRD and XPS analysis. Furthermore, mono-metallic Ni, Co and a series of bi-metallic NiCo catalysts with varied Ni:Co molar ratio were also prepared by the similar method."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The crystal structure of samples was reflected in Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which werr scanned from 5° to 85° with a scanning rate of 2.67° min−1 and a step size of 0.033° in a Philips X-Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation (l = 0.15406 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Their morphologies were recorded as TEM and HRTEM images in a Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN instrument (FEI Co., USA) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. BET specific surface area was measured by a pulsed N2 adsorption–desorption method at 77 K in Autosorb iQ Station 2. XPS spectra were obtained using an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo, USA) with Al Kα1,2 monochromatized radiation at 1486.6 eV X-ray source. Energy corrections were performed using the C1s peak of the pollutant carbon at 284.6 eV. The metal elements content was verified inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) after microwave digestion of the samples (ICP-6300, Thermo Fisher Scientific). H2 Temperature-programmed-reduction (H2-TPR), H2 Temperature-programmed-desorption (H2-TPD), and CO chemisorption in a pulse adsorption method were performed over 30 mg catalytic materials in a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyser equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For H2-TPR, the sample was pre-treated at 250 °C in 30 mL min−1 He and then measured at 40−800 °C in 30 mL min−1 10 % H2/Ar; For H2-TPD, the reduced and pre-treated sample was first adsorption H2 at 40 °C for 2 h, and then the adsorbed H2 was desorbed at 40−800 °C in 30 mL min−1 He; in a CO chemisorption, adsorption was measured in 0.9 mL per pulse 10 vol% CO/He at 50 °C until the difference of last three pulses after adsorption became lower than 1%. In-situ CO FT-IR was performed by Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector at a resolution of 4 cm−1 using 64 scans. The samples were put in a reaction cell, and before CO adsorption, the samples were reduced in-situ at 650 °C with 10 vol% H2/He for 0.5 h, cooled to room temperature in helium, and background spectrum was recorded. Then 5 vol% CO/He was introduced into the samples at 30 °C and 70 °C, the spectra were collected until the state steady. Then pure He was introduced to remove the extra CO gas, and the spectra were collected."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests The tandem hydrogenation-coupling of BA and NB was performed in a 25 mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure gauge and an automatic temperature control apparatus. Typically, 30 mg catalyst was loaded into the reactor with a mixture solution of 1 mmol BA, 1 mmol NB and 10 mL IP. The reactor was sealed and then purged three times with N2, followed by pressurizing with 1 MPa H2 and heating to target temperature with mechanical stirred at 800 rpm. When the reaction finished, the autoclave cooled down to room temperature rapidly and the product was separated with catalyst by a 0.22-μm filtering membrane. The transparent products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS, Thermo Fisher Scientific-TXQ Quntum XLS), and analyzed quantitatively by a GC-FID (Shimadzu, GC-2010 Plus), equipped with FID detector and a KB-WAX capillary column (30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 μm, Kromat Corporation, USA) using n-octanol as an internal standard. Conversion (based on NB), product selectivity and mass balance were calculated according to the Equations 1–3: (1) C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = C N B , 0 − C N B C N B , 0 × 100 % = 1 − C o c C N B , 0 × f N B × A N B A O C × 100 % (2) S e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) = C i ∑ C i × 100 % = C o c × f i × A i A O C ∑ C o c × f i × A i A O C × 100 % (3) M a s s b a l a n c e = ∑ C i + C N B C N B , 0 × 100 % Where, CNB,0 was the initial concentration of NB, CNB was NB concentration in product after reaction, and Coc was the concentration of n-octanol (internal standard). ANB and AOC represented the peak areas of NB and n-octanol detected by GC-FID, and the f NB was the correction factor between NB and n-octanol. Ci was the concentration of product i (including imine and secondary-amine and trace amount other products), Ai was the peak area of product i in GC-FID chromatogram, and fi was the correction factor between product i and n-octanol. The mass balance (based on carbon) was checked in every experimental run and detected to be higher than 97 %."
6,DFT calculation of adsorption behaviors of BA and NB,"2.5 DFT calculation of adsorption behaviors of BA and NB The adsorption behaviors of BA and NB on the surface of catalysts were calculated by a density function theory (DFT) method. The detail DFT calculations were achieved by Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) functional. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method had been used to describe the inert core electrons. We relaxed the structures until the total energy changes within 1 × 10−4 eV per atom and the Hellmann–Feynman force on each atomic site was less than 0.05 eV/Å, with a 400 eV cutoff energy. The fcc Co and Ni were used for the bulk. bi-metallic CoNi5 was constructed by replacing one Co atom by one Ni atom in every six Co atoms. Co(111), Ni(111) and CoNi(111) slab models were constructed with three atomic layers and a vacuum space larger than 20 Å. The Gamma(Γ) centered 2 × 2×1 Monkhorst-Pack sampling was used for those surfaces. The perpendicular adsorption configurations of BA and NB were chosen for qualitative analysis. In all the calculations, the top two atomic layers of the surfaces could relax together with the molecule adsorbate, while the bottom one layer was keep fixed to present the bulk properties. The adsoprtion binding energy Eb was given by the following Eq. 4: (4) Eb = Eslab/ads – Emolecule –Eslab Where, Eslab/ads was the total energy of catalyst surface adsorbed with organic molecules (BA or NB), Emolecule was the energy of BA and NB molecules, and Eslab/ads was the energy of employed metal surface slab model."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Results,"3.1 Results 3.1.1 Characterization of NiCo5 catalyst The bi-metallic NiCo5 (subscript was the Co/Ni molar ratio) nano-catalyst was derived from reduction of their precursors which were obtained from hydro-thermal of salt solutions of La, Ni and Co. The structure, morphology, and chemical properties of NiCo5 catalyst were characterized in details. Fig. 1 a showed the XRD patterns of NiCo5 and its precursor. It indicated that the precursor of the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst had low crystallinity, and only the characteristic peaks of cobalt tetroxide were shown in the precursor (Fig. 1a). Based on its H2-TPR (Fig. 1b), an appropriate reduction temperature for obtaining bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst from its precursor was 650 °C. Under this reduction condition, the diffraction peaks in the as-prepared bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst indexed to (100), (011), (012), (110), (103), (112), and (021) planes were observed as a hexagonal structure of La2O3 (JCPDS 01−074-1144) [45]. The characteristic diffraction peaks of metallic or oxidized Ni (Co) were hard distinguished from XRD patterns due to the interference of La2O3 or high metal dispersion [46]. The TEM image of the NiCo5 catalyst showed a morphology of branched nano-rods in Fig. 1c. Its principally naked planes exhibited interplanar spacing of 2.0 Å and 3.0 Å, which could be attributed to (110) and (011) planed of La2O3, as shown in High-resolution TEM image (HRTEM) of Fig. 1d. There was a great challenging to differentiate Ni or Co from La atoms in La2O3 nano-rods by HRTEM technique because Ni and Co atoms owned lower atomic number than La atom [47]. Although Ni and Co in bi-metallic NiCo5 sample were indistinguishable in XRD pattern and TEM image, the EDX images (Fig. 2 ) and ICP-OES analysis could confirm the presences of Ni and Co species in the catalyst. In Fig. 2, it could be noted that Co and Ni were uniformly distributed on the oxide support in the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst. The total metal weight concentration (Ni + Co) and the molar ratio of Ni:Co in the catalyst were 2.5 wt% and 1:5, respectively (determined by ICP-OES analysis). The surface chemical states of Ni and Co in the catalyst were further certified by the XPS spectra of Ni 3p and Co 2p. The distinguishing of La and Ni XPS spectra was very difficult due to the overlap of the La 3d and Ni 2p regions. Therefore, the Ni 3p3/2 region was examined instead of the Ni 2p domain [46–49]. The spectrum of Ni 3p3/2 at 66.8 eV binding energy could certify the existence of metallic Ni in the NiCo5 catalyst (Fig. 1e). For the region of Co 2p, both metallic (Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2) and oxidized state (CoOx 2p3/2 and CoOx 2p1/2) of Co species were presented on the surface of catalyst (Fig. 1f). On one hand, metallic Co would be oxidized to high valence during analysis. On the other hand, the oxidized Co was most likely to originate from the strong interaction between Co and Ni elements, which would further affect the activity of the catalyst. Table S1 showed that the surface atomic ratio between Ni and Co in the wide survey XPS spectrum was 1:3.3, which was higher than the value 1:5 measured by ICP, indicating that Ni element in the NiCo5 was primarily situated on the surface of catalyst. 3.1.2 Screen of the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst in selective production of imine and secondary-amine We applied the as-prepared bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst in a liquid-phase catalytic tandem reaction, which contained a mixture of 10 mL iso-propanol (IP), 1 mmol benzaldehyde (BA) and 1 mmol nitrobenzene (NB), by varying the reaction temperature ranged in 50−110 °C (Fig. 3 ). It clearly revealed that the catalytic activity and product distribution were highly correlated with reaction temperature. Although the reaction temperature was as low as 50 °C, the NiCo5 catalyst still showed a measure of catalytic activity with 16.8 % conversion (based on NB) and 63.4 % imine selectivity (1 MPa H2 and 12 h). The catalytic performance was steadily enhanced with reaction temperature rising, and 77.6 % NB conversion with 82.8 % imine selectivity were obtained at 70 °C. On this condition, the production of secondary-amine was not detected. When the reaction temperature was elevated above 80 °C, the generated imine would further convert to secondary-amine by hydrogenation reaction, suggesting the CN bond could be activated under this circumstance. For instance, the conversion of NB and selectivity of secondary-amine achieved 99.9 % and 79.0 % respectively at 90 °C. For further increasing the reaction temperature, a flourishing of side-reactions was detected, leading to a decrease in selectivity of secondary-amine and imine. Based on these data, it could be concluded that the optimal reaction temperatures for synthesizing of imine and secondary-amine from tandem reaction of NB and BA were 70 °C and 90 °C, respectively. In Figure S1, we also found that increase of H2 pressure showed a similar trend as the increase of reaction temperature, and 1 MPa was a suitable and economic H2 pressure for this catalysis. When we varied the dosage of NB from 0.5 mmol to 10 mmol at the condition of 90 °C, 1 MPa H2 and 12 h reaction, the NiCo5 catalyst demonstrated very attractive catalytic performance in all these cases (Fig. 4 a). Particularly, NB conversion could also remained over 80 % at a high NB dosage of 10 mmol, and the primary products were imine (27.1 % selectivity) and secondary-amine (49.2 % selectivity), respectively. So far, the activity and selectivity of bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst did not change significantly in eight cycling tests at such high dosage (10 mmol), demonstrating the catalyst had attractive stability (Fig. 4b). Apparently, the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst was a promising candidate for directly transforming NB and BA into imine and secondary-amine with excellent activity, selectivity and stability in a liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation-coupling tandem system. 3.1.3 Composition-dependence catalysis in tandem reaction system In order to earn an in-depth recognition on the catalytic composition-dependence, a series of bi-metallic NiCox (x: Co/Ni molar ratio) and mono-metallic (Ni and Co) catalysts were synthesized and adopted to investigate the influence of chemical composition on the activity and selectivity in tandem hydrogenation/coupling of NB and BA. The results were shown in Figs. 5 and S2. Their catalytic performances were evaluated under two different reaction conditions: 70 °C, 1 MPa within 24 h reaction and 90 °C and 1 MPa H2 within 12 h reaction. As can be seen, the activity and product distribution have a deep dependence on the chemical composition of Ni and Co. The Ni-rich bi-metallic catalyst obviously displayed higher conversion of NB than Co-rich bi-metallic samples, indicating that Ni has higher activity than Co. When reaction was performed at 70 °C, the bi-metallic NiCo1.5 and NiCo5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic behaviour with high conversion of NB and selectivity of imine. Although bi-metallic NiCo1.5 displayed good performance at 70 °C, the selectivity of secondary-amine was quite low at 90 °C because of the side reaction of BA hydrogenation (as shown in Fig. S2). As the ratio increased from 1.5 to 5, almost full conversion of NB was gained, and the selectivity of secondary-amine (product C in Fig. 5b) was steadily enhanced. Compared with other catalysts, the bi-metallic NiCo5 sample gave the best catalytic performance in view of NB conversion as well as selectivity of imine or secondary-amine. As contrast, the activity decreased obviously with Co content increase for the Co-rich bi-metallic catalysts, and the majority product transferred to aniline (product D in Fig. 5b for NiCo15 catalyst). Notably, in the case of mono-metallic catalysts (Ni and Co), the Ni catalyst showed higher activity than Co catalyst, and both of them showed far inferior activity to all the bi-metallic samples. The bi-metallic catalysts (NiCo1.5, NiCo5 and NiCo15) and mono-metallic Ni catalyst displayed similar patterns in their XRD analysis, which shows main peaks corresponding to La2O3, and they were completely different from mono-metallic Co catalyst (Fig. S3). Fig. 6 (a) was their H2-TPR profiles. It could be noted that the reduction temperatures of support in the bi-metallic and mono-metal samples were far lower than pure La sample. The shifting of reduction temperature suggested the existence of interaction between support and Ni(Co). It also indicated that the La-M-O crystal (M was the embedded Ni or Co) was easier to reduce than La-O-La. Moreover, the reduction temperatures of bi-metallic samples further shifted to a lower temperature than that of mono-metal Ni and Co samples, suggesting the interaction also existing between Ni and Co. The peak-fit had been performed in order to clearly explain the attribution of the partly overlapped reduction peaks in the six samples. At low temperature, the overlapping reduction peaks were assigned to the reduction of high valence metal ions to low valance metal ions (225−425 °C), and metal ions further reducing to metallic phase (425−500 °C). The tailing peak at 500−575 °C in the TPR profiles indicated that there was a certain interaction between metal and support, which was consistent with the reported work [50]. The reduction of support was also detected at high temperature (>575 °C). It also noted that the SMSI effects of bi-metallic samples were slightly weakened comparing with mono-metal samples, suggesting the synergistic effect of Ni and Co could partly conquer the SMSI effect. For the bi-metallic samples, the reduction temperatures also shifted to higher points as the increase of Co content, suggesting the SMSI effect was enhanced with Co loading. Because of the overlap of La 3d and Ni 2p (Fig. S4), the interaction between Ni and Co over La2O3 was also investigated by the Co 2p XPS analysis. Fig. 6(b) was the Co 2p XPS spectra of mono-metallic Co and bi-metallic samples. It could be found that Co species were existed as the mixture of metallic and oxidized Co in all these samples. More importantly, the binding energy shifted to a higher energy state with the increase of Co content in the sample. The chemical shift indicated that Co species were more likely to interact with other elements via electron donation, which was consistent with H2-TPR analysis. The electron donating from Ni to CoOx could maintain the Ni species as metallic form and Co species as the composite of metallic Co and CoOx in the bi-metallic sample. The SMSI effect could also promote metal dispersion in the bi-metallic and mono-metallic catalysts (Figs. S5 and S6). Therefore, the SMSI effect and interaction between Ni and Co were confirmed by H2-TPR and XPS analysis in the bi-metallic and mono-metallic samples. It was well known that the forceful SMSI effect would suppress the activity of active metal in hydrogenation. Therefore, the moderate SMSI effect of bi-metallic NiCo5 could not only promote metal dispersion but also maintain the hydrogenation activity, thus demonstrating excellent catalytic performance in hydrogenation-coupling tandem reaction system. Figs. S3–S8 and Table S1 showed the detail information on crystal structure, morphology and surface properties (chemical valence, metal dispersion, surface area) of the bi-metallic and mono-metallic samples. Considering the metal content in mono-metallic catalysts (for instance 0.77 wt% Ni and 2.12 wt% Co), it was interesting to find that Ni had far higher activity than Co. A detail reaction results based on Ni/Co molar ratio could also be found in Table S2. Obviously, in all these cases, the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst displayed good catalytic performance with the highest yields of imine at 70 °C and secondary-amine at 90 °C, respectively. Based on these results, the bi-metallic NiCo5 was a promising catalyst for directly transforming NB and BA into imine or secondary-amine compared with other bi-metallic and mono-metallic catalysts. And the catalytic performance was superior to Al2O3 supported bi-metallic and mono-metallic catalysts, which showed too strong interaction between metal and Al2O3. (Fig. S9 and Table S3). In the mixture system of BA, NB and H2, the reactions of BA hydrogenation and NB hydrogenation would also take place. Therefore, the catalytic performances of BA and NB hydrogenation over different bi-metallic and mono-metallic catalysts were also investigated (Fig. 7 ). Similar with tandem reaction system, the bi-metallic NiCo1.5 showed highest activities and bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst displayed moderate activities in BA or NB hydrogenation in all the cases. Because of too high activity, the bi-metallic NiCo1.5 would induce serious side reactions in tandem reaction system, such as BA hydrogenation. The activity of BA or NB hydrogenation decreased obviously with Co content increase for the Co-rich bi-metallic catalyst (NiCo15). The mono-metallic (Ni and Co) catalysts again showed inferior activity to bi-metallic catalysts. From these results, it could be found that too high Ni content in catalyst would induce serious side-reaction taking place, but high levels of cobalt could also prevent the occurring of anticipatory goal reaction. In view of this point, the coefficient of Ni and Co could adjust the activity and selectivity for catalytic conversion of NB in a hydrogenation-coupling tandem system."
9,Discussion,"3.2 Discussion 3.2.1 Reaction pathway To determinate the reaction pathway of NB and BA hydrogenation-coupling reaction, a series of reactions were investigated by varying reactants (NB or AN; BA or BAL) and gas atmosphere (H2 or N2) over the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst, and the corresponding results were listed in Table S3. It showed that only the mixtures of NB + BA+H2 (Entry 1 in Table S4), AN + BA+H2 (Entry 2 in Table S4), and AN + BA + N2 (Entry 3 in Table S4) could purposefully transform into imine. One could also learn that imine cannot be effectively generated when NB could not transform to AN (Entry 4 in Table S4), or BA is replaced/converted to BAL (Entry 5–8 in Table S4). The blank experiments on the condensation of AN with BA were also investigated in the absence of catalyst (Fig. S10). The condensation of AN with BA was a very easy and rapid reaction process. Based on these results, the nitro group (-NO2) in NB was first hydrogenated to amino group (-NH2). And then the amino bond in AN was coupled with aldehyde group (CO) in BA via carbon-nitrogen coupling reaction to form CN group in product of imine. The side-reaction of BA hydrogenation should be strictly restricted, otherwise the production of imine would be cut off. This also explained the poor selectivity pattern to imine or secondary-amine by using Ni-rich catalyst (NiCo1.5) or conducting reaction at high reaction temperature, as shown in Figs. 3 and 5. The product distribution as a function of reaction time could further give a clue for generation of imine and secondary-imine over the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst in hydrogenation-coupling of the mixture of NB, BA and H2. As depicted in Fig. 8 , the selectivity of AN (product D in Fig. 8a) was almost close to 100 % at the initial of reaction, suggesting hydrogenation of NB at the inception phase. The conversion of NB increased steadily as reaction consistently carried out, and the selectivity of imine increased obviously with the decrease of AN selectivity at 70 °C. After 24 h reaction, the selectivity of imine approached 100 %, and no other by-product generated when we further prolonged reaction time, suggesting excellent production capacity for producing imine at 70 °C. When the reaction was conducted at 90 °C, NB was also first transformed into AN (product D in Fig. 8b), and then condensed with BA to form imine (product B in Fig. 8b), as showing the increase of BA selectivity at first 3 h in Fig. 6b. And then the selectivity of AN and imine decreased as reaction proceeding, meanwhile the selectivity of secondary-amine (product C in Fig. 8b) enhanced steadily around the reaction. It validated that the CN group in generated imine could further hydrogenate into CN group to form secondary-amine at 90 °C. As a result, the mixture of NB and BA could be transformed effectively and selectively towards imine or secondary-amine by simply adjusting reaction temperature in one-pot. In this reaction system, the majority barrier was the very closing chemical properties (such as boiling point, polarity, solubility, etc) between imine and secondary-amine. Therefore, the two products could selectively synthesize over the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst making the process extremely economical and attractive. 3.2.2 DFT calculation on adsorption configurations Based on above description, the catalyst should have different affinity with BA and NB to achieve the tandem reaction of hydrogenation and carbon-nitrogen coupling. The difference could be reflected from the absorption configurations of organic molecules on metal surface, because the adsorption behavior was one of the most important parameters influencing catalytic performance in liquid-solid phase reaction (liquid phase: reagents and solvents; solid phase: catalyst). Therefore, DFT calculations with BA and NB adsorption models on the surface of bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst were employed here and compared with mono-metallic (Ni and Co) catalyst to illuminate the different adsorption affinities. The corresponding adsorption configurations and calculated results were shown in Fig. 9 , Fig. S11 and Table S5. The binding energies of BA on CoNi5, Co, and Ni surface were −0.42 eV, −0.37 eV and −0.43 eV, respectively. As can be seen, only replacing one Co by Ni atom in Co matrix, the binding energy was almost close to pure Ni catalyst, suggesting a promoting effect by Ni doping in NiCo5, which was consistent with the in-situ FTIR of CO adsorption (Fig. S12). The enhanced adsorption capacity was more prominent in NB adsorption. The binding energy of NB on CoNi5 was −1.00 eV, which was higher than that of mono-metallic Co and Ni (−0.89 eV and −0.80 eV, respectively). Obviously, Ni doping in NiCo5 matrix could effectively promote the adsorption of reagents (BA and NB) on the surface of catalyst. More importantly, the binding energy of NB (−1.00 ev) was far higher than that of BA (−0.42 eV) on the surface of NiCo5, suggesting the bi-metallic catalyst had a more intimate affinity with NB. This was a key message that would determine the reaction path: in this liquid-solid phase reaction system of BA, NB and NiCo5 catalyst, the reactant NB was more easily adsorbed and activated on the surface of catalyst to transform directly into intermediate of AN, and the generated AN was further coupled with adsorbed BA to form imine or secondary-amine (based on reaction parameters). 3.2.3 Reaction dynamics In the reaction system with the mixture of NB, BA and H2, besides the tandem reaction of hydrogenation-coupling towards imine, there were other types of reactions that might take place, such as BA hydrogenation into BAL, NB hydrogenation into AN, and imine hydrogenation towards secondary-amine. The study on the kinetics of these reactions could steer clearly to design effective catalyst for tunable production of imine or secondary-amine. Fig. 10 depicted the reaction dynamics in BA hydrogenation, NB hydrogenation, hydrogenation-coupling of NB and BA, as well as imine hydrogenation at 70 °C (Fig. 10a) and 90 °C (Fig. 10b), respectively. As can be seen, all of these four reaction systems exhibited first-order reaction kinetic behaviors at 70 °C and 90 °C, as shown linear relation between Napierian logarithm of conversion (ln(1-conversion of reactant)) and reaction time. The slop of the linear curve was the reaction rate constant k (h−1). On these bases, the reaction rate constants of BA hydrogenation (k1 ), NB hydrogenation (k2 ), hydrogenation-coupling of NB and BA (k3 ), and imine hydrogenation (k4 ) were calculated and listed in Table 1 . Comparing the value of k1 (0.011 h−1) and k2 at 70 °C (0.167 h−1), it could easily understand that the NB hydrogenation was more likely to occur than BA hydrogenation. NB was first reduced to AN and then quickly realized CN coupling with un-reduced BA, as reflecting from the result of time on stream (Fig. 6) and the high value of k3 (0.225 h−1), which was the overall reaction rate of NB hydrogenation and CN coupling. The higher value of k3 than k2 suggests that the CN coupling between AN and BA could promote the hydrogenation of NB to AN by a Le chatelier's principle. The small k4 value (0.003 h−1) at 70 °C explained the reaction of imine hydrogenation would hard take place under this reaction condition. Thus, high yield of imine could be obtained by hydrogenation and CN coupling between NB and AN over bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst at 70 °C. When the identical reaction was taken place at 90 °C, all the reaction rates (k1 to k4 ) increased obviously, especially for the k4 of imine hydrogenation. Therefore, the imine could further transform into secondary-amine at 90 °C, thus resulting in high selectivity to secondary-amine. For further increasing the reaction temperature, the reaction of BA hydrogenation cannot be prevented because of high reaction rate. Therefore, the optimal reaction temperature for high selectivity of secondary-amine was 90 °C over the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst. As the study on the relationship of reaction rate k and temperature T, the reaction activation energy (Ea ) were further calculated based on Arrhenius equation(lnk=-Ea/RT + C), and the values were listed in Table 1. The reaction of hydrogenation and CN coupling showed the smallest Ea value (19.8 kJ/mol) among the four kinds of reactions, suggesting the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst had very attractive activity for converting NB and BA into imine."
10,Extension of reaction system,"3.3 Extension of reaction system The mild reaction conditions of the tandem reaction reported here could also be applied to a variety of substituted aromatic nitro and aldehyde compounds. Their catalytic behaviors over the bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst were shown in Table 2 and Fig. S13. The electron donating substitutes such as methyl (−CH3), hydroxy (−OH), and methoxy (−CH3O) were well befitted the tandem reaction of hydrogenation and CN coupling, and afforded excellent yields for corresponding products of imines. Although the presence of electronic nature and position of substitutes had some impact on the yield of imine products, the effect was not significant. For instance, the substitutes on the aromatic aldehyde had almost no effect on the yield of corresponding imine, and the position of substitutes on aromatic nitro slightly affected the production of imine. Under the same concentration of reactant and reaction conditions, the ortho-aromatic nitro displayed the lowest yield than meta- and para-aromatic nitro compounds, indicating a weak steric hindrance effect in tandem reaction system. Apparently, all of these substituted aromatic nitro and aldehyde compounds could react well with each other and displayed good yield to corresponding imines."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, we had designed a highly efficient bi-metallic NiCo5 catalyst for the one-pot hydrogenation-coupling of aromatic nitro and aldehydes compounds to selectively synthesize imines or secondary-amines by facilely tuning of reaction parameters. The composite of Ni and Co and SMSI effect could purposefully regulate the catalytic properties of active metals for tuning the catalytic performance in tandem reaction system of hydrogenation-coupling. DFT calculated adsorption model and reaction dynamic studies were investigated to probe the tandem reaction pathway in the mixed catalytic system, which could pave a way for design efficiently selective catalysts in multi-step reactions. The stability and gram scale tests (10 mmol NB) manifested good stability and scalability. Furthermore, the mild reaction conditions of the tandem reaction could also be applied to a variety of substituted aromatic nitro and aldehyde compounds and displayed good yield to corresponding imines, making the process extremely economical and practical."
