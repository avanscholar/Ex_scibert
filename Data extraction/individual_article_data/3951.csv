0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an important renewable energy source. Due to its high energy density and zero emission, hydrogen has become an ideal energy source to replace traditional fossil fuels. Electrochemical decomposition of water for hydrogen production has attracted more and more attention as an appealing hydrogen production strategy [1–4]. The water-splitting reaction comprises two half-reactions, that is, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of anode. In order to effectively carry out these two reactions, appropriate electrocatalysts are needed to reduce the electrochemical overpotential and improve the reaction rate. Pt is recognized as the state-of-the-art catalyst for the HER, but its high cost and scarcity hinder its commercial application [5–7]. Ru is considered as the most effective electrocatalyst in OER [8–10]. Meanwhile, Ru has displayed a definite HER in alkaline solution because it could efficiently lower the kinetic energy barrier of the Volmer step [11,12]. In order to further enhance the HER activity, some researches on ruthenium-based electrocatalysts mainly focus on doping or alloying with Ru, thus changing the electronic structure of Ru itself. Alloys such as RuCo [13,14], RuPd [15,16], RuNi [17–19], RuPt [20], RuMo [21], RuIr [22], RuY [23], RuFe [24] and RuCu [25] have been prepared and investigated for HER activity in recent years. In terms of nonmetallic doping, phosphides [26], sulfides [27] and nitride [28] doped ruthenium have been studied. All of the above studies have improved the HER activity of Ru and made it exceed that of Pt in alkaline solution. However, in acidic solution, HER activity still needs to be further improved to achieve the same activity as Pt [29–39]. The modification on the morphology of Ru electrocatalyst is also a method to improve its HER activity. Creus [40] used organometallic synthesis method to obtain ligand-capped Ru Nanoparticles with very small particle size, which have exhibited very excellent HER activity in acidic and alkaline media. In 1 M NaOH or 1 M H2SO4 condition, it has displayed lower overpotentials (η 10 = 25 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for 1 M NaOH, η 10 = 20 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for 1 M H2SO4) than those of commercial Pt/C and Ruthenium black. Porous ruthenium nanomaterials derived from an organometallic precursor were synthesized by Drouet [41], which has shown good electrocatalytic performance and good durability for HER under acidic and neutral conditions. In 0.5 M H2SO4, its low overpotential is η 10 = 83 mV, and its durability can reach 12 h. A method for preparing Ru nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on carbon (Ru/C) through adsorption-low temperature pyrolysis was developed by Xu [42]. Ru/C synthesized by calcination at 300 °C has the highest HER activity in alkaline solution, which only requires an overpotential of 14 mV to reach a current of 10 mA cm−2. Both Nazir [43] and Edison [44] have obtained RuO2 nanorods by simple thermal decomposition method, with a overpotential of η 10 = 130 mV and η 10 = 120 mV respectively. Zheng [45], Gao [46] and Lu [47] creatively prepared Ru with fcc structure, which has exhibited better HER activity than those of Ru with hcp structure and Pt in alkaline solution. The above research results have proved that controlling the morphology of Ru can improve its HER activity. Therefore, the preparation of ordered spherical ruthenium nanocatalysts by hydrothermal method is described in this paper. The spherical structure can be clearly seen through SEM characterization. The crystal structure and surface electronic state were characterized by XRD and XPS. At the same time, the electrochemical properties and surface charge were studied and analyzed by CV characterization. The experimental results have demonstrated that the HER activity of Ru-HT is obviously better than that of Ru-LR. The hydrothermal method has the advantages of controllability and variability [48]. By adjusting hydrothermal time and hydrothermal temperature, HER activity in acidic medium was further optimized. During the optimization process, it was found that the preparation conditions would change the hydrogen adsorption intensity on Ru surface to some extent. The adsorption strength of Ru-H, together with the electrochemical surface area, will affect the HER activity of Ru."

2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Ruthenium trichloride (RuCl3·3H2O), n-butyl alcohol (C4H12OH), ethanol (C2H5OH), sodium acetate (CH3COONa·3H2O), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), acetone (C3H6O), polyvinyl pyrrolidone ((C6H9NO)n), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. All reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification. Argon gas (99.999%) was purchased from Ming-Hui company."
3,Electrode preparation,"2.2 Electrode preparation CH3COONa·3H2O solid (0.2449 g) was added to 0.02 mol L−1 RuCl3 n-butanol solution with the molar ratio of CH3COO– to Ru3+ 3:1. After uniform stirring for 30 min, the homogeneous black solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and sealed. The hydrothermal reaction is carried out for 1 to 8 h at the temperature of 120 to 180 °C. After the reaction was completed, anhydrous ethanol and ultra-pure water were used for washing 3 times respectively, and dried in a vacuum oven to obtain solid powder. The sample was recorded as Ru electrocatalyst prepared by hydrothermal method (Ru-HT). NaBH4 (0.9079 g) solid was added to 10 mL of n-butanol solution. Magnetic stirring is adopted to disperse it into suspension. Then 0.02 mol L−1 RuCl3 n-butanol solution (30 mL) was slowly added to the solution. After stirring for 10 min, add 2–3 mL of ultrapure water and continue stirring for 30 min. When there is basically no bubble generation, the stirring is stopped and let stand for 10 min. The supernatant was poured out, washed with ethanol and ultrapure water for 3 times respectively, and dried in vacuum to obtain solid powder. The sample was recorded as Ru electrocatalyst prepared by liquid phase reduction method (Ru-LR). Accurately weigh 2.5 mg of catalyst sample (Ru-HT or Ru-LR) and 2.5 mg of carbon powder (XC-72), put them into agate mortar, and finely grind them to make them mix evenly. The catalyst powder was then added to 1 mL of 0.05 wt% Nafion-ethanol solution. Ultrasonic oscillation was performed for 30 min to disperse the sample evenly to form catalyst ink. The catalyst ink was dripped onto the surface of Ti plate electrode with an effective area of 0.5 cm2. The catalyst loading was 0.25 mg cm−2."
4,Material characterization,"2.3 Material characterization The phase and crystalline structure of electrocatalyst were determined by X-ray diffraction technique (XRD). The inspection was carried out at room temperature on a XRD-7000 X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM: S-3000 N, Hitachi Co., Japan), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS: ESCLAB 250Xi, Thermo Scientific) with monochromatized Al Ka radiation was used to analyze the electronic properties. The fitting of the data was obtained with XPS Peak41 software."
5,Electrochemical measurements,2.4 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical experiments were carried out on a CHI760D electrochemical analyzer. All of the electrochemical measurements were carried out in a typical three-electrode electrochemical glass cell with a carbon paper was used as a counter electrode and Hg/Hg2SO4/K2SO4(0.1 M) as the reference electrode (E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Hg/Hg2SO4) + 0.616 V + 0.0592 V × pH). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed from 0 to 1.3 V (vs. RHE) in Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at the scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The electric double layer capacitance is determined by different sweep speeds in the range of 0.38–0.48 V (vs. RHE). The HER polarization curves were obtained by sweeping the potential from −0.3 to 0.2 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at overpotentials of 0.05 V with the frequency ranging from 100 mHz to 100 kHz with a constant ac voltage amplitude of 10 mV. The data of EIS were processed (electrical equivalent circuits and quantitative parameters) using a computer system with the ZView Analyst software package. The number of measurements in electrochemical experiments is three.
6,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 has displayed XRD patterns of Ru-HT and Ru-LR electrocatalysts. Compared with Ru-PDF#06–0663 standard card, the diffraction peaks of Ru-LR electrocatalyst at 38.4°, 41.2°, 43.9°, 58.3°, 69.4°, 78.4°, 82.2°, 84.7° and 85.9° respectively correspond to its (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112) and (201) crystal planes. For Ru-HT electrocatalyst, the diffraction peaks at 38.2°, 43.6°, 58.1°, 69.4°, 78.2° and 85.0° correspond to the crystal planes of (100), (101), (102), (110) and (201), respectively. The diffraction peaks of Ru-HT electrocatalyst are mostly weak dispersion peaks, while the diffraction peaks of Ru-LR electrocatalyst are relatively sharp, indicating that the crystallinity of Ru-LR electrocatalyst is obviously better than that of Ru-HT electrocatalyst. Fig. 2 is a SEM image of Ru-HT and Ru-LR electrocatalysts. Obviously, the morphologies of two kinds of electrocatalysts are quite different. First of all, it can be seen from Fig. 2a that Ru-HT has consistent morphology and uniform particle size. However, Ru-LR has shown obvious agglomeration and uneven particle size distribution in Fig. 2b. Secondly, from Fig. 2c, it can be concluded that Ru-HT has spherical structure and smooth surface with particle size 300–500 nm. It may be due to the continuous nucleation and growth of Ru grains under high temperature and high pressure during hydrothermal synthesis. Moreover, some smaller particles with a particle size of about 100 nm can be observed in Fig. 2c. As for Ru-LR, it has formed some large micron-sized particle clusters, but some porous honeycomb structure can be clearly seen on the particle clusters (Fig. 2d). In addition, it can be seen from Fig. S1 that the extension of hydrothermal reaction time will destroy the spherical structure of Ru-HT and make it no longer have an integrated spherical shape. However, the change of hydrothermal reaction temperature in Fig. S2 has little effect on the spherical morphology and particle size of Ru-HT. Fig. 3 is an XPS analysis result of Ru-HT electrode. The splitting vibration peaks of the Ru 3d, Ru 2p spin orbitals and O1s orbital can be obtained in Fig. 3a. The Ru 2p orbit was further analyzed by high-resolution XPS in Fig. 3b. The peaks at 462.1 eV and 484.4 eV correspond to Ru 2p3/2 and Ru 2p1/2 spin orbits, respectively. Fig. 3c is a high-resolution XPS characterization of the Ru 3d orbit. The peaks at 280.5 eV and 284.5 eV correspond to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 spin orbits of Ru, respectively. The peaks at 281.2 eV and 285.5 eV are their satellite peaks. In addition, the vibration peak of C 1s orbital is at 285.0 eV in Fig. 3c. Fig. 4a is a cyclic voltammogram (CV) of Ru-HT and Ru-LR electrocatalysts. It is clear that both Ru-HT and Ru-LR have obvious characteristics in hydrogen region (0–0.3 V). From the potential of 0.3 V, both two electrodes have begun to generate hydrogen-under potential deposition (H-UPD) current. The H-UPD current of Ru-HT increases faster than that of Ru-LR and reaches a current density of 3.96 mA cm−2 at 0.17 V. For Ru-LR electrocatalyst, an unobvious oxidation current peak can be seen at 0.05 V, but the peak current (0.89 mA cm−2) is obviously less than that of Ru-HT (7.35 mA cm−2). The above analysis has shown that the characteristic peak of Ru-HT electrocatalyst is more distinct than that of Ru-LR electrocatalyst in the hydrogen region. Then, the weak and wide peak that can be observed just after the hydrogen desorption (especially for Ru-HT in Fig. 4a and Ru-HT-120 in Fig. 7) is attributed to a surface oxidation process [49–51], which demonstrates that the hydrogen adsorption/desorption process and the surface oxidation process are very close. In addition, in order to accurately test the electrochemical surface area (ESA) of the two electrocatalysts, the potential scanning was carried out at different scanning speeds in the potential range of 0.38–0.48 V (Fig. S3). The current density at 0.43 V (vs. RHE) is plotted against the corresponding scanning rate, thus obtaining the relationship between scanning rate and current density in Fig. 4b. The double-layer capacitance of Ru-HT is 9.29 mF, while that of Ru-LR is only 2.75 mF. According to the ideal metal capacitance 40 F cm−2, the ESAs were estimated to be 232.25 cm2 (Ru-HT) and 68.75 cm2 (Ru-LR), respectively. Their specific mass ESAs were 1858 cm2 g−1 (Ru-HT) and 550 cm2 g−1 (Ru-LR) on the basis of the 0.125 mg cm−2 loading of Ru. The electrochemical activities of HER of Ru-HT and Ru-LR electrocatalysts were analyzed in Fig. 5 . When the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Ru-LR electrocatalyst is 88.8 mV, while the overpotential of Ru-HT electrocatalyst is reduced to 55.7 mV. Meanwhile, when the overpotential is 200 mV, the current density of Ru-LR is only 45.1 mA cm−2, while that of Ru-HT increases to 78.1 mA cm−2. Both the increase of current density and the decrease of overpotential have indicated that Ru-HT electrode can possess better HER activity than that of Ru-LR electrode. There are two possible reasons for the improvement of HER activity. One is the increase of ESA of electrocatalyst, which is beneficial to augment of the hydrogen adsorption capacity from water molecules. The other is the change of the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst itself, which changes the hydrogen adsorption energy on the electrode surface, thus changing the electrochemical reaction path. Which one plays a major role needs to be analyzed objectively and carefully. First, after normalized by ESA, the specific activity of Ru-LR electrode is better than that of Ru-HT electrode in Fig. S4. Then, it is generally concluded that the intrinsic activity of Ru-HT electrode has not been improved and the increase of apparent current is mainly due to the enlargement of ESA. However, an increase of ESA may not always lead to an improvement of apparent activity. In Fig. S5, the apparent activity of 1 wt% and 20 wt% commercial Pt/C catalysts is almost the same, but their ESA is 20 times different. Therefore, sometimes, increasing ESA does not necessarily significantly improve apparent activity. It is speculated that the reason of the above phenomenon should be related to the rate determining step in hydrogen evolution reaction. In acidic solutions, the process of HER mainly involves three reactions. The common first step is the Volmer reaction (H3O+ + e = Had + H2O, a theoretical Tafel slope of 116 mV dec−1), which is followed by either the Tafel reaction (combination desorption, Had + Had = H2, a theoretical Tafel slope of 29 mV dec−1) or the Heyrovsky reaction (electrochemical desorption, H3O+ + Had + e = H2 + H2O, a theoretical Tafel slope of 38 mV dec−1) to give H2. As can be seen from Fig. 4b, Ru-HT has exhibited a larger ESA than that of Ru-LR, so it may generate more Ru-H adsorption state on the surface of electrode, thus activating a large number of H atoms. If the formation of Ru-H in the process of HER is a rate determining step, the apparent HER current will improve with the increase of the ESA. Then, in order to discuss the rate determining step, the mechanism of HER is analyzed by Tafel slope in Fig. 5b. Tafel slope is determined by fitting the linear regions derived from LSV curves for low overpotential (<100 mV) and small current densities (<10 mA cm−2) based on the Tafel equation (η = b log j + a), in which η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, j is the current density, and a is the intercept relative to the exchange current density. The Tafel slope of Ru-LR is 46.1 mV dec−1, and the exchange current density is 0.34 mA cm−2. However, the Tafel slope of Ru-HT is only 36.5 mV dec−1 and the exchange current density is 0.44 mA cm−2. Low Tafel slope and high exchange current density are the reasons why Ru-HT has high HER activity. Tafel slopes can prove that both reaction mechanisms on two kinds of electrodes are Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The rate determining step of the HER process should be determined to be the electrochemical desorption step, not the electrochemical adsorption step. Therefore, the increase in ESA is not the whole reason for the increase in apparent HER current. The main reason for the enhancement in apparent activity is maybe that Ru-HT electrode could reduce Ru-H bond energy, which is beneficial to increase H-desorption rate of Heyrovsky step, thus improving HER activity. Discussions on the above will be studied in detail in subsequent experiments. The effects of hydrothermal reaction time and temperature on HER activity were further analyzed. In Fig. 6a, with the prolongation of hydrothermal time, the charge in the hydrogen region and double-layer capacitance increase continuously, indicating the enhancement of Ru-HT's ESA. Secondly, as can be seen from Fig. 6b, the potential of the Had oxidation desorption peak is 0.179 V for the Ru-HT-1h electrode. When the hydrothermal time is 2 h and 4 h, the Had oxidation desorption peak potential has shifted negatively to 0.133 V, with a significant negative shift of 46 mV. The negative shift of Had oxidation desorption peak has indicated that the hydrogen adsorption strength on the electrode surface become weak, which is beneficial to the break of Ru-H bond, thus accelerating the desorption of hydrogen and improving the HER activity. Compared with Ru-HT-4h electrode, the potential of Had oxidation desorption peak of Ru-HT-8h electrode slightly positive shifted by 11 mV, but it was still significantly negative by 35 mV compared with that of Ru-HT-1h electrode. Fig. 6c has displayed their HER activities. When the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Ru-HT-1h electrode is 129 mV, while the overpotential of Ru-HT-2h, Ru-HT-4h and Ru-HT-8h electrodes decreases by 54 mV, 70 mV and 72 mV respectively. When the overpotential is 0.2 V, the current density of Ru-HT-1h electrode is 26 mA cm−2. However, for Ru-HT-2h, Ru-HT-4h and Ru-HT-8h electrodes, the current densities are 46 mA cm−2, 66 mA cm−2 and 72 mA cm−2, respectively. Therefore, it can be known that prolonging hydrothermal time is beneficial to improving HER activity. The increase in HER activity may be related to the above-mentioned reduction in hydrogen adsorption strength and increase in ESA. Ru-HT-1h electrode has the worst HER activity because of its smallest ESA and highest potential of desorption peak. For Ru-HT-2h and Ru-HT-4h electrodes, their HER activity is obviously improved, mainly because their potentials of desorption peak are the lowest. At the same time, the ESA of Ru-HT-4h electrode is larger than that of Ru-HT-2h electrode, so Ru-HT-4h electrode has better activity. For Ru-HT-8h electrode, although its potential of desorption peak is not the lowest, its maximum ESA makes its activity close to that of Ru-HT-4h electrode. In Fig. 7c, the HER activity of Ru-HT electrode is continuously enhanced with the increase of hydrothermal temperature in the range of 120–180 °C. When the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Ru-HT-120 electrode is 94 mV, while Ru-HT-140, Ru-HT-160 and Ru-HT-180 electrodes are reduced by 13 mV, 40 mV and 37 mV respectively. When the overpotential is −0.2 V, the current density of Ru-HT-120 electrode is 40 mA cm−2. The current densities of Ru-HT-140, Ru-HT-160 and Ru-HT-180 electrodes can reach 52 mA cm−2, 72 mA cm−2 and 78 mA cm−2, respectively. Therefore, the increase of hydrothermal temperature is beneficial to the improvement of HER activity. The enhancement of HER activity can also be preliminarily analyzed by CV characterization, as shown in Fig. 7a–b. In Fig. 7a, the double-layer capacitances of Ru-HT electrocatalysts with different hydrothermal temperatures are not much different, which indicates that their ESAs are similar. Therefore, the influence of hydrothermal temperature on HER activity is not caused by the increase of ESA. However, their peak potentials of Had oxidation desorption are different, the peak potentials have shifted regularly in Fig. 7b. When the hydrothermal temperature changes from 120 °C to 180 °C, the peak potentials are located at 0.174 V, 0.157 V, 0.146 V and 0.134 V respectively. This regular negative shift has indicated that the adsorption energy of Ru-H decreases continuously, which also corresponds to the continuous improvement of HER activity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to investigate the charge transfer mechanism on the two kinds of electrodes. The Nyquist diagrams were recorded at an overpotential of 50 mV vs. RHE. Due to the electrolyte with high ionic strength in the solution, the solution resistance (Rs) is 0.22 Ω cm2 and 0.16 Ω cm2 respectively in Fig. 8a and b. Moreover, their membrane resistances (R f) are close, which are 1.08 Ω cm2 and 1.47 Ω cm2. However, for the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), the value of Ru-HT (7.76 Ω cm2) is obviously smaller than that of Ru-LR (14.92 Ω cm2), suggesting fast charge transport during the HER process. Therefore, Ru-HT electrode has excellent activity of HER."
7,Conclusions,"In the present study, the preparation of ordered spherical ruthenium nanocatalysts by hydrothermal method is described in this paper. The spherical structure with the particle size 300–500 nm can be clearly seen by SEM characterization. The CV characterization has shown that the characteristic peak of Ru-HT electrocatalyst is more obvious than that of Ru-LR electrocatalyst in the hydrogen region. The specific mass ESAs of Ru-HT is 1858 cm2 g−1 Ru, which is 3.4 times that of Ru-LR (550 cm2 g−1 Ru). The LSV experimental results have demonstrated that the HER activity of Ru-HT is obviously better than that of Ru-LR. When HER current density reaches 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Ru-LR electrocatalyst is 88.8 mV, while the overpotential of Ru-HT electrocatalyst is reduced to 55.7 mV in acidic medium. The Tafel slope of Ru-HT is only 36.5 mV dec−1 and the exchange current density is 0.44 mA cm−2, which indicates the rate determining step of the HER process should be the electrochemical desorption step (Heyrovsky step). The adsorption strength of Ru-H will affect the HER activity of Ru together with the ESA. By adjusting hydrothermal time and hydrothermal temperature, HER activity was further optimized. During the optimization process, the regular negative shift of desorption peak potential in the hydrogen region in CV has indicated that the adsorption energy of Ru-H decreases continuously, which also corresponds to the continuous improvement of HER activity."
