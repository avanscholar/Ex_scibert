0,Introduction,"Wastewater from the textile industry causes a big problem in water resources due to a large volume of wastewater discharged from various steps in dyeing and finishing processes without treatment [1,2]. The dye-contaminated wastewater contains reactive dyes, which posed a threat to aquatic life and public health [1,2]. Also, it may cause toxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity to humans [3]. For example, methylene blue (MB) cause health problems such as nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, tissue necrosis, eye burn, and difficulty in breathing [4–6]. Hence, many treatment methods have been developed to eliminate textile dyes, including photo-degradation, adsorption, coagulation, ion exchange, and membrane filtration [1,4,7–17]. Among them, adsorption is one of the most economic methods due to facile operation and high removal efficiency [18]. Typically, activated carbon is a preferred adsorbent for dye elimination due to its high adsorption capacity [19,20]. Nevertheless, it has a major drawback in the difficult and high-cost recovery after decolonizing organic species [19,20]. Therefore, it is great to develop inexpensive, easy handle, and eco-friendly adsorbents with high removal efficiency for organic dyes. The requirement for a good adsorbent with high removal efficiency for organic dyes should have a high uptake of dye, easy to produce in large quantities, have a low cost, and easy collection after use [21]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) – derived material is considered a potential material due to its containing biodegradable property [22,23]. In fact, the PVA has many applications including the textile, paper industry, and food packaging industry because of its biodegradability, film-forming ability, chemical stability, transparency, gas barrier, nontoxic and mechanical properties [24–28]. However, the strong affinity toward water molecules of PVA arising from the high density of hydroxyl groups along the polymeric backbone has limited the utilization of PVA in the water environments [25,29]. Thus, many approaches have been proposed to improve the hydrophilic nature of the PVA film by cross-linking PVA, using chemical agents (i.e., glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, boric acid, citric acid, and clay) and physical processes (heat treatment; UV and electron beam irradiation) [26,30–32]. PVA-based hydrogels by cross-link method have been extensively studied for removal of textile dyes because hydrogel structure allows dye molecules easily adsorbed into the matrix via swelling and capturing them in 3D cross-linked porous networks [33]. However, PVA hydrogels showed poor adsorption capacity for dye molecules due to their unlimited solubility in the water while PVA-based hybrid hydrogels had great potential for removing dye from aqueous solution. Indeed, the adsorption capacity of PVA hydrogels for MB is still low even with the addition of bentonite (20 mg/g) [33], cellulose (6.07 mg/g), scleroglucan (15.19 mg/g), zein (5.58 mg/g) [34], glutaraldehyde/β-cyclodextrin (27.25 mg/g at pH 11) [30], and glutaraldehyde (38.76 mg/g) [35]. Recently, Sabarish et al. also reported that the combination of ZSM-5 zeolite and the PVA/carboxymethyl membrane improved the adsorption capacity of up to 81.9 mg/g for MB [36]. Nevertheless, the drawback of PVA/carboxymethyl/ZSM-5 zeolite membrane was the effect on human health from direct exposure due to the use of non-environmental cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde [37]. In the present work, we modified PVA with a blend of polysaccharides to produce biodegradable and eco-friendly hydrogel composite materials for removing textile dyes from aqueous solution. It is worth noting that all components utilized to prepare the composite membrane are environmentally friendly, largely available, and biodegradable. Composed of alternating 1,3-linked d-galactose and 1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose units, agar has been often studied as an additive to facilitate the biodegradation as well as to improve the mechanical performance of PVA films [38,39]. Instead of using toxic cross-linkers such as glutaraldehyde, herein we employed the combination of agar and d-glucose; both are polar substances containing abundant hydroxyl groups capable of interacting efficiently with hydroxyl groups along the main chains of PVA thereby potentially changing the film properties. In light of this contribution, the resulting composite membranes allow to rapidly eliminate organic dyes and they are easy to recover and prevent a large amount of sludge as resource of secondary pollution resulting from the use of activated carbon and zeolite. Furthermore, the synthesized composite membranes of PVA with d-glucose and agar showed high selective adsorption of cationic dye (e.g. methylene blue) and negligible adsorption for anionic dye (e.g. congo red). Also, the nonlinear regression of Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and D–R isotherms and pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, Bangham kinetic models were evaluated to obtain the best-fit isotherm and kinetic model."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyvinyl alcohol cold-water-soluble (87–89 % hydrolyzed, Mw = 160,000 g/mol,) and d-glucose (C6H12O6, 99 %) purchasing from HiMedia (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt., Ltd, India), and Agarose power ((C6H10O5)n) purchasing from VWR (Van Water & Rogers part of Avantor, French), were used as the main materials for the composite membrane production. Methylene blue (C16H18ClN3S, MB, 99 %), and Congo red (C32H22N6Na2O6S2, CR, 99 %) were also purchased from HiMedia and used as adsorbates. All main reagents along with other materials, including glycerol (HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH, 99 %), potassium chloride (KCl, 99 %), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 98 %), and chloride acid (HCl, 37 %), were used without further purification."
3,Preparation of the membranes,"2.2 Preparation of the membranes The PVA based composite membranes were prepared from PVA, d-glucose, agar, and glycerol as described in Scheme 1 . Firstly, the mixture of PVA, d-glucose, and agar aqueous solutions with various weight ratios (Table 1 ) was magnetically stirred at 200 rpm for 1 h before the addition of 30 wt.% of glycerol (with respect to the total weight of PVA, d-glucose, and agar) as a plasticizer. Glycerol is used as a plasticizer because glycerol is a green material, polyol-based plasticizer with high valorization temperature [40]. Additionally, the suitable content of glycerol to plasticize the PVA-based membrane was found at 25–30 % [41]. Also, our preliminary showed that 30 % is the best percentage of glycerol using as a plasticizer for the PVA membrane (Fig. S1). The resulting solutions were followed by further homogenization under magnetic stirring for 1 h at room temperature (27 °C). The film-forming solutions were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2 min to eliminate bubbles and solid residues. Subsequently, the centrifuged solutions were cast on the polypropylene molds (20 cm × 20 cm) before dried at 45 °C for 48 h. The visual demonstration for the fabrication of membrane was illustrated in Fig. S2. The synthesized composite membranes were denoted as shown in Table 1. Prior to analysis and use, the dried membranes were stabilized at 25 °C for 24 h without any purification."
4,Characterization and adsorption study of membranes,"2.3 Characterization and adsorption study of membranes The tensile measurement of membranes was performed according to ASTM D882–02 standard using AG-Xplus Series Precision Universal Testers (Shimadzu Inc., Japan). The samples were cut into 25 mm × 100 mm and then stabilized for 24 h before testing. The tensile test conditions were set at a gauge length of 50 mm, load cell of 20 kN, and a crosshead speed of 50 mm/min. The average values of tensile strength and elongation at break were obtained from at least 5 specimens for each composition. The surface and cross-section morphology of membranes was evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S-4800 equipment (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Japan). The attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded using a JASCO FT/IR-6000 spectrometer paired with an ATR PRO ONE (Jasco International Co., Ltd., Japan) in the range of 4000 − 400 cm–1. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the composite membranes was determined using a Q500 analyzer (TA Instruments Ltd., USA). The samples were measured at the temperature range of 27−600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min under N2 atmosphere. The hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the composite membranes was evaluated via contact angle measurement using Theta Optical Goniometer (KSV Instrument, USA). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on a D2 PHASER - X-ray Diffraction equipment (Bruker Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) using Cu-K as a radiation source with a scan rate of 0.2/s in the 2-theta range of 5–80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded on Thermo VG Multilab 2000 equipment (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with Al Kα radiation and low energy electrons streams as the excitation source (225 W, 15 mA, 15 kV). The swelling percentage of PVA/D-glucose/agar membranes was conducted according to the method described by Bich et al. [42]. Typically, the membranes with the size of 2 × 2 cm were dried at 70 °C for 24 h and then weighed to get the initial weight of the specimen (Wd). Subsequently, the dried samples were immersed in distilled water at room temperature (27 °C) and taken out at different times from 30 to 360 min. The swollen weight of the samples (Ws) was measured after wiping the excess water on the surface of the swollen samples by using tissue paper. The swelling degree of membranes was calculated by the following equation: (1) S w e l l i n g d e g r e e % = W s - W d W d x 100 % The pH of point of zero charge (pHpzc) was determined using the method described by Lalhmunsiama et al. [43] with some minor changes. Briefly, the initial pH value (pHi) of 50 mL of KCl 0.1 M solution was adjusted to the pH values of 2, 4, 6, and 10 by using NaOH and HCl solutions. The 6P2D2A membrane (0.1 g) was added into the prepared KCl solution following stirring for 10 min at room temperature (27 °C) and stabilizing for 24 h, then, the final solution pH values (pHf) were recorded. The pHpzc was obtained from the plot of pHf against pHi at the point pHi = pHf."
5,Adsorption study,"2.4 Adsorption study The adsorption capacity of PVA/D-glucose/agar membranes was performed using methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR) dyes as adsorbates. Firstly, a specimen of the 6P2D2A membrane (W ≈ 0.1 g) was added into an aqueous dye solution (V ≈ 50 mL; initial dye concentration Co ≈ 50 mg/L), then shaking at 200 rpm for 120 min at room temperature (27 °C). The equilibrium dye concentration (Ce) of the aqueous solution after adsorption was determined by using an Evolution 60S UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). The adsorption capacity (Qe) was calculated as follows: (2) Q e = C o - C e W × V P e r c e n t a g e r e m o v a l = C o - C e C o . 100 q e = C o - C e W . V where Co is the initial dye concentration (mg/L) and Ce is the equilibrium dye concentration (mg/L); V is the volume of testing solution (mL) and W is the weight of the membrane (g). The influence of experimental parameters, including the contact time, pH, the PVA content, and the initial dye concentration, on the adsorption capacity of the composite membranes was carried out in a batch reactor with MB as adsorbate at room temperature (27 °C). The weight of the composite membranes (0.1 g) and the initial dye concentration of 50 mg/L were fixed for all experiments and for three former parameters, respectively. The contact time between adsorbents and adsorbates were evaluated in a series of time from 0 to 240 min at pH7 over the 6P2D2A membrane. The effect of pH was performed with the lowest contact time showing the most effective adsorption over the 6P2D2A membrane. The effect of PVA content in the composite membranes on the adsorption efficiency also was investigated at the most effective pH and the contact time. Finally, the influence of the initial dye concentration was explored at the different initial MB concentrations in the range of 10–300 mg/L with the chosen experimental condition at the best adsorption achievement from the previous three performances."
6,Reusability of adsorbent,"2.5 Reusability of adsorbent The main advantage of the PVA/D-glucose/agar membrane utilization for dye removal is easy to recover after using and being able to regenerate. Herein, the reusability of the 6P2D2A membrane after the MB adsorption process was evaluated preliminarily with absolute ethanol, distilled water, and ethanol-water mixture in different ratios of volume. Ethanol-water (60:40) mixture provided the best efficiency to regenerate the 6P2D2A membrane after dye adsorption. Therefore, the experiments of reusability were conducted by immersing MB captured composite membranes in ethanol-water (60:40) solution for 24 h and then separating the adsorbent from dye solution before washing with distilled water and utilizing for the further adsorption-desorption process."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of membranes,"3.1 Characterization of membranes 3.1.1 ATR-FTIR studies Fig. 1 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of the pristine PVA and functionalized PVA composite membranes. The spectrum of PVA possesses the main peaks of OH, CH, and CO stretching. Indeed, the peaks at ca. 3290 cm−1 and 1443 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching and bending of OH groups [44]. The CH group stretching and bending spectra are observed at 2931 cm– 1 and 1203 cm–1, respectively [45]. While the CO and C–O groups stretching show at 1731 cm–1 and 1038 cm–1, respectively [36,46]. The addition of D-glucose and/or agar affects the pristine PVA materials. d-glucose seems to have a lower effect than agar on the PVA samples. The addition of agar shifts the OH stretching to lower frequency due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between C-O-C linkages of agar and OH groups of PVA [47,48]. Also, the new peaks are pronounced at 931 and 890 cm–1 assigned to 3,6-anhydrogalactose and β-galactopyranosyl in agar [47,49]. Additionally, agar remains skeletal with the skeleton bending of pyranose ring at 770 and 740 cm–1 [49]. While the addition of D-glucose into pure PVA shows a strong influence of d-glucose with a strong peak at 1022 cm−1, and shifting the peak at 1098 cm−1 to lower frequency [50]. Making all the samples with d-glucose are different with the parent PVA and 5P5A samples. In fact, the difference of the CO groups stretching (∼ 1022 cm−1) and carbon ring deformation vibration (∼ 1098 cm−1) are due to the presence of D-glucose or agar. In the cases of the co-addition of D-glucose and agar, the spectra show both chacteristics of d-glucose and agar, suggesting that both agar and D-glucose have strong interaction with pure PVA. 3.1.2 XRD studies The crystal structure of pristine and functionalized PVA membrane was evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 2 ). Semi-crystalline structure of PVA has typically presented the broad diffraction peak at 2θ of 19° [51,52]. The addition of agar (5P5A sample) introduced a broad peak at ca. 13° and flattened the typical peak of PVA, indicating the predominance of amorphous fraction in the structure of the PVA/agar membrane [38,46,53]. In contrast to agar, the interaction with d-glucose (5P5D sample) produced the new peaks at 2θ values of 18°, 28° and 38° which was attributed to the characteristic crystalline structure of d-glucose [54]. The presence of D-glucose (50 %) in the PVA membrane also remarkably decreased the typical peak of PVA at 2θ of 19°. Suggesting that the interaction of d-glucose enhanced the crystalline character of the PVA membrane, whereas agar introduced the amorphous character into the PVA/agar membrane. The XRD results is relative to ATR-FTIR data, where D-glucose has more influence than agar with the more change in shifting peak and intensity. The interaction of both d-glucose and agar showed the co-effect of both materials, but likely the amorphous and semi-crystalline structure were predominant at lower D-glucose and agar adding (10–30 %). At very low d-glucose and agar addition (10 %, 8P1D1A sample), the crystal peak of d-glucose was still observed at 2θ of 18°, while at 30 % d-glucose content (4P2D2A sample), only a broad peak was observed (Fig. 2). However, the typical peak of PVA at 2θ of 19° enhanced the intensity with the addition of both d-glucose and agar. This indicated that there is a strong interaction among three materials possibly due to the formation of hydrogen bonds from hydroxyl groups of PVA, d-glucose, and agar [55,56]. Interestingly, the addition of very high d-glucose and agar percentage (40 %, 2P4D4A sample) showed a difference in characteristics. With low PVA percentage and high d-glucose and agar percentages, the XRD pattern was presented mostly sharp peaks, meaning more crystals present. It reveals that high agar and high D-glucose percentages can form more crosslinks with PVA and together to produce new crystals along with the crystal of d-glucose. Our results indicate that the synergistic effect of agar and d-glucose may affect the crystalline order of the PVA matrix. Also, the addition of d-glucose and agar has to limit under 40 % to get semi-crystal materials. 3.1.3 Morphology studies The morphology of pristine and functionalized PVA has been characterized using SEM analysis (Fig. 3 ). The closure surface of the functionalized PVA by adding d-glucose and agar indicated a good dispersion of agar and maltodextrin of d-glucose into a PVA matrix. However, the surface of the d-glucose-functionalized PVA showed the wavy lines images (Fig. 3c) in comparison with pure PVA and PVA + agar (Fig. 3a &b), due to the crystalline characteristic of D-glucose. The interaction of both agar and d-glucose presented both characteristics of d-glucose and agar showing a smooth surface of amorphous and crystal lines of crystalline parts (Fig. 3d). Looking at the cross-section images (Fig. 3, inserted part), PVA presented laminar texture along with disordered amorphous regions as evidence of semi-crystalline structure material [57]. While the addition of agar enhanced the amorphous of the sample making it more flat and strong interaction as obtained with the smooth surface images. The combination of both d-glucose and agar changed the morphology of the pristine PVA. The functionalized material contained both crystal and amorphous but introduced more pore channels possibly arising from the interaction among three-parent materials. The interaction of PVA with both d-glucose and agar also produced hydrogel materials containing hole-like defects [58,59]. The same porous structure was also found in PVA hydrogel incorporated with agar and carrageenan [60]. The surface images of the samples with an increase of D-glucose and agar addition showed the flattest with 30 % of agar, whereas the surface of low and high agar contents represented the mixed amorphous-crystal morphology (Fig. 4 ). It is clear in the cross-section images, the lower addition of both d-glucose and agar still showed mainly the characteristic of PVA, but the effect of d-glucose and agar was also obtained. With increasing d-glucose and agar percentages, the semi-crystal was performed with 20 and 30 % of d-glucose and agar (Fig. 4, cross-section) due to the increase in the crosslinking density. However, with the excessive contents of d-glucose and agar, mainly crystal was obtained possibly due to the high content of crystalline d-glucose material and high crosslink among PVA, d-glucose, and agar. This observation matched with the XRD spectroscopy, where the lowest PVA sample presented mainly the crystalline structure. The crosslink of hydroxyl groups of PVA, agar, and D-glucose also formed the pore structure of the hydrogel membrane. The more d-glucose and agar enhanced the crosslink bonds but decreased the pore size of the functionalized membrane. Suggesting that the percentage of the additional materials (D-glucose and agar) has a strong impact on the pore size of a new hydrogel. Therefore, the pore size of the hydrogel can be tailored by controlling the additive percentage for the adsorption of different materials. 3.1.4 Thermal properties The presence and effect of d-glucose and agar addition on the thermal stability of the PVA membrane have been characterized by the TGA-DTG study (Fig. 5 ). For the pristine PVA, three distinct peaks were observed in the temperature of 70–170 °C, 200–380 °C, and 405–500 °C. The first weight loss can be attributed to the evaporation of loosely bound water adsorbed by the PVA membrane. The side chains of PVA started to considerably decompose from 200 °C and reached a peak of 331 °C in the DTG curve [46,61,62]. The third degradation region came from the decomposition of carbonization [57]. The addition of d-glucose and/or agar induced a moderate decrease in thermal stability of the functionalized PVA membrane and the major decomposition in the second stage began from 150 °C. The addition of d-glucose and/or agar reduced the DTG peak of moisture, indicating that D-glucose or agar or new-formed crosslinks enhanced the hydrophobicity of the system. For only agar addition (50 % wt/wt), the agar degraded in the temperature region of 240–300 °C, but the peak was broad and unseparated with the degradation of PVA. Also, agar perhaps formed a new linkage with PVA and functionalized the higher peak of starting PVA materials at ca. 450 °C (Fig. 5b). Indicating that agar had a strong interaction with the pristine PVA. In the case of D-glucose, d-glucose decomposed higher than agar in the temperature range of 200–290 °C. This outcome agreed well with the previous report [63]. Suggesting that the blending of crystalline d-glucose with PVA is lower than that of agar with PVA. In fact, the surface morphology of the PVA/agar membrane is smoother than that of the PVA/D-glucose membrane. Interestingly, the simultaneous incorporation of agar (20 %, wt/wt) and D-glucose (20 %, wt/wt) significantly improved the thermal stability of the PVA matrix in the temperature range of 300–400 °C and above. Additionally, d-glucose from the functionalized material (6P2D2A) seems to decompose in the same temperature range as d-glucose in the 5P5D sample, demonstrating that d-glucose still had low interaction with PVA and/or agar in the system like PVA-agar interaction even heavy density of hydroxyl groups found in new hydrogel materials of PVA, d-glucose, and agar. Besides, the vaporization temperature of moisture absorbed by thin-film significantly increased up to 156 °C for the 6P2D2A membrane in comparison with other composites membranes. This outcome again confirmed the improvement of hydrophobicity of new hydrogel materials after interacting with d-glucose and/or agar. This increase may be explained due to hydrogen interaction between −OH groups of PVA, d-glucose, and agar, which exerted more hydrophobic properties of composite membranes compared to bare PVA material. Thus, such hydrogen bond networks may act as a barrier to loose bounded water molecules, increasing the evaporation temperature of absorbed water. Regarding d-glucose and agar content in the composite membrane on thermal stability, the TGA and DTG thermograms were reported in Fig. 5c & d. The evaporation temperature of bounded water considerably increased with increasing d-glucose and agar content. For example, the decomposition temperature of moisture on the 8P1D1A membrane was recorded at 100 °C, while it was obtained at 153 °C, 155 °C, and 157 °C for the 6P2D2A, 4P3D3A, and 2P4D4A samples, respectively. Looking at the degradation region, at the very low percentage of d-glucose and agar, the 8P1D1D sample represented mostly the properties of the PVA sample combining the decomposition peak of d-glucose in the temperature region of 200–300 °C. The increase in d-glucose and agar content reduced the effect of PVA with a remarkable decrease the weight loss and the peak in the temperature range of 300–400 °C (Fig. 5c & d). However, the residual weight percentage of samples at 600 °C increased with increasing D-glucose and agar content. That confirmed that the thermal stability of the PVA membrane enhanced with the addition of d-glucose agar [32]. 3.1.5 Water resistance properties In order to study the hydrophobicity of functionalized samples, the contact angle and swelling degree of all investigated samples were performed (Fig. 6 a & b). PVA is well known as a hydrophilic material with a low contact angle (43°) as expected. The incorporation of alone agar enhanced the hydrophobic nature of PVA with an increase of contact angle to 50° even agar possessing hydrophilic character. This is similar with the previous study reporting that the addition of 50 % (wt/wt) agar could improve the hydrophobicity of κ-carrageenan blend film with glycerol as plasticizer (30 %, wt/wt) [64]. While d-glucose addition decreased in contact angle on the PVA membrane. That proved that agar has strong interaction with PVA than that of d-glucose by forming the crosslink as the same performance using FT-IR spectroscopy and SEM analysis. The addition of both d-glucose and agar showed the improvement of contact angle with different aspects. The maximum contact angle was observed at 63° for the 6P2D2A membrane. This outcome well agrees with TGA analyses that the bound water percentage adsorbed in the 6P2D2A membrane was lower compared to other composite membranes. In brief, the hydrophobic property of the PVA membrane was significantly improved due to the synergistic effect of agar and d-glucose. Similar observations were reported by Zhang et al. that contact angle of PVA membrane using pyromellitic dianhydride cross-linker could increase up to 58° [65]. The results also allow us to tailor the hydrophobicity of PVA-derived hydrogel for adsorption purposes. The swelling degree is defined as a volume expansion of the solid contacted liquid, which is characteristic of ideal hydrogel materials [66]. Fig. 6b showed the swelling degree of as-prepared composite membranes from a water-dipping for 350 min. Neat PVA membrane and PVA/D-glucose were completely soluble for a short time soaked in water and it was difficult to record weight loss; therefore, we did not report the swelling degree of those materials. Meanwhile, the PVA/D-glucose/agar composite membranes became rubbery, evidenced by an increase in swelling degree. The swelling degree of all PVA/D-glucose/agar composite membranes increased with an increase of time up to 95 min and decreased after that. The swelling degree of 2P4D4A and 8P1D1A samples dramatically dropped after the maximum point. While that of 4P3D3A and 6P2D2A samples likely remained during the increase of time. At the maximum point, the swelling degree was in the order of 2P4D4A > 8P1D1A > 4P3D3A > 6P2D2A. The highest swelling degree of 2P4D4A is possibly due to the lower hydrophobicity and strong crystallization as performed in SEM analysis, which can form more pores to trap the water. For the 8P1D1A sample, the high swelling degree may come from the high content of PVA, a hydrophilic material, in the sample, even it has a high contact angle. The higher swelling degree of the 2P4D4A sample compared to the 8P1D1A sample with very high amount of PVA (a hydrophilic material) is related to the crosslinking occurred in the polymeric network. Indeed, the 2P4D4A sample possesses high amount of crystalline polymer (from SEM data) cause a decrease in the density of crosslinking in the polymeric network in comparison to the 8P1D1A sample. In the case of 4P3D3A and 6P2D2A, the former has a low swelling degree possibly because of the high density of cross-linking in the polymeric network. While the latter can explain by both the big pore size and the high hydrophobicity of this material. Due to the advantage of the 6P2D2A material, this material was chosen for further adsorption investigation. 3.1.6 Mechanical behaviors Film thickness of pure PVA and composite samples was controlled by taking equal volume in film preparation to ensure ignorable variation. The film thickness is significantly increased by the introduction of agar and d-glucose (Table 2 ). The mechanical behavior of the PVA/D-glucose/agar membranes was determined via tensile strength and elongation at break as given in Table 2. For the pure PVA membrane, the tensile strength, elastic modulus, and elongation at break were found at 76 MPa, 384 MPa and 245 %. The addition of 50 % d-glucose or agar reduced the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the PVA membrane. However, d-glucose enhanced the elongation at break of the PVA membrane, while agar decreased this behavior of the PVA. This result is due to the solid form of material addition with crystalline d-glucose and amorphous agar. For both mixing of d-glucose and agar, the tensile strength, elastic modulus, and the elongation at break dramatically decreased with increasing D-glucose and agar contents. The poor tensile strength of high d-glucose and agar samples may come from the formation of hole-like defects as observed in Fig. 4 resulting in the interruption and discontinuities in the network. Furthermore, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds between −OH groups in the PVA were partially replaced by intermolecular hydrogen bonds among hydroxyl groups of PVA, d-glucose, and agar, causing discontinuities of polymer chains. The stretch of PVA/D-glucose/agar reached a peak of 344 % for the 8P1D1A membrane and decreased with further increasing d-glucose and agar content. The initial increase in elongation at break of the PVA membrane with a small content of D-glucose and agar was evidence for good compatibility among all systems in the polymer network. However, the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the polymeric matrix exerted a reduction in the mobility of the PVA chains at higher d-glucose and agar content. On the other hand, the mechanical property of the membrane may be influenced by the degree of swelling of composite membranes. As a result of increasing swelling degree, the interaction space between the chains in the polymer network became far and thus exert a decrease in the resistance to fracture of membrane material [67]. Similar behavior has reported on the incorporation of sodium alginate into the PVA [68]. In our case, the chosen material for adsorption, 6P2D2A, has lower the tensile strength and the elongation at break than that of the 8P1D1A and PVA samples, but it is a promising material for adsorption with high mechanical behavior too. Additionally, the tensile strength and elongation at break values of our PVA membranes incorporated with d-glucose and agar are comparable and even higher than those of many reported PVA-based composite membranes for adsorption application [69,70]. For instance, the tensile strength of PVA film incorporated with 40 % nano-cellulose from cotton linter was 10 MPa, and this index of PVA with the addition of 5% nano-cellulose from sugarcane bagasse was found in 0.09 MPa. While the addition of 20 % of d-glucose and agar into PVA (6P2D2A sample) showed high the tensile strength (>13 MPa) and high elongation at break (> 170 %)."
9,Adsorption studies,"3.2 Adsorption studies To perform the adsorption capacity of the chosen 6P2D2A material, the experiments at fixed conditions, i.e., the contact time of 120 min, pH 7, initial concentration of 50 mg/L, and 0.1 g 6P2D2A with two organic dyes represented for cationic dye-MB and anionic dye-CR, were conducted. The MB concentration decreased rapidly when the 6P2D2A membrane was soaked into a dye solution and the adsorption capacity was obtained around 24 mg/g (Fig. 7 a). In contrast, CR dye could not be adsorbed by the 6P2D2A membrane (Fig. 7b). The same performance was also obtained on another cationic dye (Crystal Violet) and anionic dye (Methyl Orange) at the same adsorption condition (Table S1). This phenomenon could be explained due to the surface charge of the PVA/D-glucose/agar membrane, represented by the zero point of charge (pHpzc) as shown in Fig. 8 a. The pHpzc is generally indicated as the solution conditions at which the charge density of adsorbent’s surface equals zero [71]. Here, the pHpzc of the PVA/D-glucose/agar membrane was determined at 6.3, implying that the negative charge surface was found at the pH of a solution > 6.3 [72]. In this experiment, at pH 7, the surface hydroxyl groups are negative charge, which is available for adsorption of cationic dye due to the electrostatic attraction (Fig. 8b). Therefore, the selective adsorption of the PVA/D-glucose/agar membrane for cationic dye at a neutral solution could provide a promising platform for further filtration and separation of dye molecules in the dye industry. Moreover, at pH5 < pHpzc (6.3), the adsorption of MB dye on the 6P2D2A membrane decreased from ∼ 24 mg/g (pH7) to ∼ 15 mg/g (pH5), while that of CR dye increased from ∼ 1 mg/g (pH7) to ∼ 2 mg/g (pH5) (Table S2). This phenomenon can occur because the low pH solution can protonate the surface of adsorbent causing a decrease in the interaction between the adsorbents and adsorbates. Also, the acidic medium in the solution provides more H+ ions leading more competition between the ions of electrolyte and MB dyes on the adsorption sites of the adsorbent. To confirm the presence of MB in the 6P2D2A membrane after adsorption, the XPS technique was employed to reveal the existence of this cationic dye. Both spectra of the membrane before and after adsorption showed the presence of elements C and O with the C1s and O1s XPS spectra at ca. 285.98 eV and 532.17 eV, respectively, arising from C and O of the membrane and/or methylene blue (Fig. S3 a). After adsorption, a new peak appeared at 399.63 eV is possibly assigned to the –N(CH3)2 group of MB dye [73–75], confirming that MB molecule had been captured on the 6P2D2A hydrogel membrane (Fig. S3 a & b). Additionally, the binding of CO and CO of C1s XPS spectra shifted from 284.90 eV to 285.25 eV and from 286.88 eV to 287.07 eV, respectively (Fig. S3 c & d). These changes in the state of CO and CO during the adsorption process may be explained due to the formation of electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged surface groups (CO, CO) of the 6P2D2A membrane and the positively charged amino group of MB molecule. The shifting of C1s XPS spectra and the presence of N1s XPS spectra again demonstrated the success of the adsorption of MB on the surface of the 6P2D2A membrane. Furthermore, the structural change of composite membranes before and after MB adsorption was affirmed by the ATR-FTIR analyses (Fig. S4.). The intensity of all characteristic peaks of MB-captured membranes, i.e., OH groups and CO bonds, is reduced in comparison with spectra of membranes without MB, suggesting the interaction of hydroxyl groups of membrane components and the functional moieties of dye molecules [76]. The stretching vibration band of the CO bond at 1026 cm−1 shifted to 1041 cm-1 whereas the stretching vibration of CO group at 1736 cm−1 and the flexion of OH group at 1423 cm-1 were disappeared. Besides that, the new peaks appeared at 1549 cm-1 and 884 cm-1, 1338 cm-1, and 1601 cm-1 assigned to the aromatic ring vibrations and wagging vibration of CH in the aromatic ring of MB dye [77]. Based on the promising selective adsorption of the PVA/D-glucose/agar membrane, the batch experiments to study the effect of different adsorption parameters were performed. The effect of agitation time on uptake efficiency of the 6P2D2A membrane was evaluated in the range of 0–240 min while fixing dye concentration and adsorbent dosage at 50 mg/L and 0.1 g at pH 7 (Fig. 9 a). The adsorption capacity of MB rapidly increased from the beginning to 50 min and reached the maximum at 120 min, then remained a plateau after that. The increase in adsorption capacity at the initial stage was ascribed to many available occupied sites for MB molecules on the 6P2D2A membrane. The further decrease in uptake of MB as a function of time could be attributed to the decline in the active sites. Our results associated with the literature on the adsorption capacity of the Polyvinyl alcohol/carboxymethyl cellulose/ZSM-5 zeolite membranes with MB adsorbate [36]. So, the contact time of 120 min with the maximum of MB removal was selected for further experiments. The pH of the medium is known as a crucial operating parameter because it directly affects the uptake efficiency of the composite membranes, which regarded as the surface charge. In this experiment, the effect of pH on MB removal of the 6P2D2A membrane was conducted in a range of 2–10 while maintaining MB concentration and adsorbent dosage at 50 mg/L and 0.1 g, respectively. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of MB increased within increasing pH and reached a maximum of 24 mg/g at pH 7 (Fig. 9b). The increase of MB adsorption with an increase of pH from 2 to 7 due to the increase in the negative charge for the surface of the membrane, where MB adsorbed on the membrane by electrostatic attraction [78]. In fact, the negative charge of the membrane surface enhanced with an increase in pH because of its pHzpc of 6.3. However, the removal efficiency of MB dropped with a further increase in the pH solution. This outcome is because the glutinousness in the alkaline environment may act as a barrier hindering the contact between MB molecules and active groups on the membrane surface, leading to a slow adsorption rate. Hence, the pH of the medium at 7 was the best choice to use for further investigation with maximum adsorption capacity. The effect of dye initial MB concentration on the adsorption capacity of the 6P2D2A membrane was also evaluated in the range of 0–300 mg/L with the experimental conditions of adsorbent dosage =0.1 g, pH = 7, and contact time = 120 min. As depicted in Fig. 9c, the adsorption capacity of the 6P2D2A membrane considerably rose with increasing initial MB concentration and stabilized when MB concentration was higher than 200 mg/L (Fig. 9c). This behavior is given that the stronger mass transfer driving force at higher dye initial concentration leads to a significant increase in adsorption capacity. However, at higher initial concentrations, the uptake capacity seems to remain unchanged due to the saturation of adsorption points. Similar results were reported on PVA/tannic acid/sodium alginate hydrogel for removing MB [74]. As mentioned, the PVA content plays an important role in the thermal, water resistance, and mechanical properties of the resulting composite membranes, thereby it could affect the adsorption efficiency of the composite membrane. Indeed, the MB adsorption capacity showed a volcano plot and obtained the highest adsorption capacity of 24 mg/g for the incorporation of 60 % PVA (Fig. 9d). The trend of MB adsorption capacity was proportional to the increase of the PVA content from 20 to 60 % and associated with the swelling degree obtained. In fact, the swelling degree of functionalized PVA membranes decreased with proportional to the increase of PVA contents from 20 to 60 % (Fig. 6b), meaning that the hydrophobicity also enhanced with the same trend avoiding water adsorption and allowing the adsorption of MB. With very high PVA content (80 %), the hydrophobicity of material decreased as the observation of the swelling degree (Fig. 6b) causing competitive adsorption of water and MB, making a decrease in MB adsorption capacity. Additionally, the pore size of produced hydrogel materials may influence the adsorption capacity of MB. The decrease of the PVA content tended to a decrease of pore size due to the increase of hydroxyl cross-linkages. That indicates that suitable pore size is necessary for MB adsorption. To perform the durability of the synthesized membrane, the recycle experiments have been studied. The 6P2D2A membrane was chosen to adsorb methylene blue, and desorption process was carried out in ethanol-water (60:40) mixture. It is well-known that the cost-effectiveness of adsorbent is evaluated via not only high adsorption capacity but also good reusability. After adsorption with MB, the MB-adsorbed 6P2D2A membranes were immersed in ethanol solvent for 24 h to completely release MB dye. Then, the regenerated composite membranes were utilized for the further adsorption and the adsorption capacity of the 6P2D2A membrane for MB dye gradually decreases with increasing recycles (Fig. 10 ). For instance, the adsorbed MB amount is 24 mg/g for the first cycle while the uptake capacity gains 10 mg/g after 6 generations. This decrease may be attributed to incomplete desorption of MB molecules from the composite membrane surface."
10,Adsorption kinetics and isotherm studies,"3.3 Adsorption kinetics and isotherm studies There are many studies focusing on the adsorption mechanism of wastewater [4,16,17] and several investigations showed the mistake of adsorption kinetics [79,80]. Recently, Du et al. [81] reviewed the contaminant adsorption of hydrogels and reported the adsorption mechanism for these materials. For our PVA-based hydrogels, the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm using non-linear regression were studied in order to predict the adsorption process due to more appropriate and accurate determination of calculated model parameters compared to linear regression method as it prevents the errors raised by the inconsistence coming from simple linear regression [83]. The adsorption capacity of MB on the PVA/D-glucose/agar membranes was simulated by four adsorption models, including pseudo-first-order [84], pseudo-second-order [85], Elovich [86] and Bangham [87] models. These equations were respectively described as follows: (3) P s e u d o - f i r s t - o r d e r : Q t = Q e 1 - e - k 1 t q t = q e ( 1 - e - k 1 t ) (4) P s e u d o - s e c o n d - o r d e r : Q t = Q e 2 k 2 t 1 + k 2 t Q e q t = q e 2 k 2 t 1 + k 2 t q e (5) E l o v i c h : Q t = 1 β l n 1 + α β t q t = 1 β l n ( 1 + α β t ) (6) B a n g h a m : Q t = k B t α B q t = k B t α B where Qe (mg/g) is related to the amount of MB adsorbed at equilibrium; Qt (mg/g) is correlated to the amount of MB adsorbed at time t; k1 (1/min) is the equilibrium rate constant of pseudo-first-order adsorption, k2 (g/(mg × min)) is the equilibrium rate constant of pseudo-second-order; α (mg/(g × min)) is an initial chemisorption rate constant; β (mg/g) is desorption constant; kB and αB are the Bangham constants. Additionally, statistical comparison values were used to evaluate the fitness confidence of nonlinear models, i.e., adjusted coefficient (R2), mean relative error (MRE) and sum square error (SSE) [88,89] as observed in Eq.7–9. (7) R 2 = ∑ i = 1 n ( Q i , e x p - Q i , e x p ¯ ) 2 - ∑ i = 1 n ( Q i , c a l - Q i , c a l ¯ ) 2 ∑ i = 1 n ( Q i , e x p - Q i , e x p ¯ ) 2 (8) M R E % = 100 n ∑ i = 1 n Q i , c a l - Q i , e x p Q i , e x p (9) S S E = ∑ i = 1 n ( Q i , c a l - Q i , e x p ) 2 From the statistic and experimental, it is confirmed the non-linear regression curves of Elovich and Bangham models did not well fit with the experimental (Fig. 11 a). Whereas, both pseudo order models were better than, in which, the non-linear regression curves of the pseudo-first-order model fitted with the experimental data (Fig. 11a). Also, the adjusted coefficient (R2) determined the most fitting of the pseudo-first-order model with the trend Pseudo-first-order (0.997) > Pseudo-second-order (0.984) > Elovich (0.967) > Bangham (0.963) (Table 3 ). Additionally, the Pseudo-first-order possesses the highest R2 with also the smallest MRE (1.420) and SSE (0.810). Confirming that the adsorption process of the 6P2D2A composite membrane for the MB dye removal was in good agreement with the pseudo-first-order model, which suggests that the MB adsorption process was initially controlled by diffusion mechanism [90–92]. Moreover, the pseudo-second-order and Elovich model were documented in a good correlation, indicating that besides diffusion-controlled, chemisorption can also significantly contribute to the overall adsorption mechanism. The isotherm study was conducted to evaluate the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates, offering insights into the adsorption mechanism. Herein, the adsorption isotherm of MB on the 6P2D2A composite membrane was evaluated using four models, including Langmuir [93], Freundlich [94], Temkin [95], and Dubinin Radushkevich (D–R) [96]. According to the literature, the Langmuir isotherm model is closely related to homogeneous and monolayer adsorption surface as well as limited adsorption sites while the Freundlich model assumes the energy distribution of the adsorption process on heterogeneous surfaces along with multilayer sorption. The Temkin model is associated with the decrease in adsorption heat due to weak interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate, and the D–R model is explained due to the effect of the porous structure of the adsorbents. The equation of Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin Radushkevich (D–R) models were respectively listed as follows: (10) Q e = Q m K L C e 1 + K L C e q e = Q m K L C e 1 + K L C e R L = 1 1 + K L C o R L = 1 1 + K L C o (11) Q e = K F C e 1 / n q e = K F C e 1 / n (12) Q e = B T ln k T C e q e = B T ln k T C e B T = R T b B T = R T b ) (13) Q e = Q D R e - K D R ε 2 q e = Q m e - B ε 2 E = 1 2 K D R ; ε = R T l n 1 + 1 C e E = 1 2 B ε = R T l n ( 1 + 1 C e ) where Ce (mg/g) is equilibrium MB concentration, Co (mg/g) is the initial MB concentration, KL (L/mg) is the Langmuir equilibrium constant, RL is separation factor (unfavorable if RL> 1, linear if RL = 1, favorable if 0 < RL< 1, and irreversible if RL = 0). KF [(mg/g).(L/mg)n] is Freundlich constant and n corresponds to the Freundlich intensity parameter (excellent adsorption if 2 < n < 10, relatively difficult adsorption if 1 < n < 2, and poor adsorption if n < 1). BT is a constant related to the heat of adsorption, b (L/mol) is an isotherm constant, and kT (L/g) is the Temkin isotherm constant regarding equilibrium binding. QDR (mg/g) and KDR (mol2/kJ2) are the adsorption capacity and the D–R constant closely associated with the sorption energy, meanwhile E (kJ/mol) and ε are the mean adsorption energy and the Polanyi potential. After calculating and fitting, the adsorption isotherm curves and calculated parameters of the MB removal by the 6P2D2A composite membrane were illustrated and reported in Fig. 11b and Table 4 . The Langmuir isotherm model is the most fitting model with the most fitting isotherm curve with the experimental data and having the highest R2 (0.996) and the lowest MRE (3.094) and SSE (2.085). As a result, the adsorption isotherm of the 6P2D2A membrane for MB obeyed the Langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capacity attained at 29 mg/g. Additionally, the RL value was obtained at 0.080 in the range of 0–1 favoring the adsorption. Therefore, the non-linear form of Langmuir exhibited a good correlation with the adsorption process of MB on the 6P2D2A membrane indicating the formation of monolayer dye coverage on the homogeneous adsorbent surface."
11,Conclusions,"The PVA/D-glucose/agar composite membranes have been successfully manufactured by the casting method. The hybrid composite membranes were characterized by SEM, ATR-FTIR, XRD, TGA, XPS, contact angles, and swelling degree; and performed the adsorption capacity as well as predicted the adsorption kinetic and isotherm models. The interaction of d-glucose and agar with PVA enhanced hydrophobicity, thermal stability, and mechanical properties making the synthesized membranes were sustainable in an aqueous solution for more than 350 min. The results indicated that the selective adsorption of cationic dyes was mainly due to electrostatic interaction between negatively charged functional groups in the polymer and positively charged dye molecules. The 6P2D2A sample showed the best membrane with high adsorption capacity (29 mg/g) and recyclable to adsorb cationic dye (methylene blue). Additionally, the adsorption of methylene blue was well-controlled by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model. Hence, PVA/D-glucose/agar composite membranes are promising adsorbents for dye-based wastewater purification and further separation."
