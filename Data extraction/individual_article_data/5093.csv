0,Introduction,"OMS-2 belong to the family of manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS) that correspond to a synthetic cryptomelane form of manganese oxide [1] that has been extensively studied in the past decade in various catalytic reactions (selective hydrogenation of halogenated arenes [2]; total oxidation of ethyl acetate [3]; ethanol [4,5]; benzyl alcohol oxidation [6,7] and sulfide [8]), sorption and ion-exchange processes [9,10], environmental remediation [11] and production of battery materials [12]. OMS-2 is a porous mixed-valent metal oxide (KMn4+ 7 Mn3+O16·nH2O) with a 2 × 2 tunnel architecture (dimensions of 4.6 × 4.6 × 6.5 Å), bearing corner and edge shared MnO6 octahedral units with K+ and H2O inside the tunnel [13]. Other manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves contain 1 × 1 tunnels that are too narrow to incorporate bulky cations [10], or larger 3 × 3 tunnels (OMS-1) which are able to accommodate larger cations like Mg2+ which, in addition, may contribute to the stabilization of the structure [14]. Its surface area [15] strongly depends on the preparation method varying in following order: solvent free (155 m2/g) > microwave reflux (148 m2/g) > conventional reflux (96 m2/g) > hydrothermal (44 m2/g). On the basis of the cations present in the structure, the different types of cryptomelanes have been classified as cryptomelane (K), manjiroite (Na), hollandite (Ba), etc. [16]. In this series, potassium was reported to be able to stabilize the 2 × 2 tunnel structure of the cryptomelanes. Its simple exchange with protons may produce OMS-2 with acid properties [17]. Furthermore, the catalytic properties of these materials can easily be expanded by doping with other elements like Pd, Ce, Co, Ti [18], Zr [19], Sn [20]. Ionic liquids (ILs) have received a considerable interest in the recent decades due to the very large variety of applications including electrochemistry (electrolytes in batteries, fuel cells, solar panels), chemistry (coatings, lubricants, dispersants, plasticizers, solvents, as stationary phases for HPLC), physics (as modifier refractive index, matrix for mass spectrometry), biology (embalming, biocides) [21–23] and catalysis [24]. The negligible vapor pressure, non-flammability character, Brønsted/Lewis acidity [25], the solubility of various organic, inorganic and organometallic compounds and high thermal conductivity are among the properties which made them attractive for catalysis as solvents and/or catalysts in numerous processes [24,26]. However, despite these advantages a number of disadvantages have been highlighted including the difficulty in isolating the product from the IL. To eliminate this problem and also to diminish the mass transfer limitations, Mehnert and co-workers [27,28] and Wasserscheid and co-workers [29,30] proposed the heterogeneization of ionic liquids as ""Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP)"" wherein thin layers ionic liquids are deposited on solid supports. Alternatives to SILP for generating heterogeneous catalysts correspond to the anchoring of IL to the surface via a covalent bond (the SILC concept) [31] or to coating the IL on a support by physisorption (the Solid Catalyst with Ionic Liquid Layer, SCILL concept) [32–34]. To date, SCILL has been reported in selective catalytic hydrogenations including citral to citronellal [35], limonene to p-menthene [36] under supercritical CO2 conditions, propyne to propene [37] and of a 1-octene/1-octyne mixture [38]. In addition, it has been used to catalyse isomerizations [39]. The selective oxidation is an important process for manufacture of chemicals and chemical intermediates. Among these, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is an important process due to the fact that benzaldehyde is a valuable chemical for perfumery, dyestuff, pharmaceutical and agro-chemical industries and also as an industrial solvent [40,41]. Traditionally, benzaldehyde is produced by the partial oxidation of toluene or the hydrolysis of benzylidene chloride [42] but the operating conditions of these processes are challenging and significant generation of wastewater occurs [43]. Based on this, many efforts have been made to transfer this oxidation into more environmentally friendly processes using green oxidation agents and heterogeneous catalyst systems [44–47]. Among these, the use of OMS-2 has been examined [48]. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of SCILL-type catalysts based on OMS-2 for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. With this aim, we report, herein, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with molecular oxygen or air, as cheap and friendly environmental oxidizing reagents, over IL modified and unmodified OMS-2 and 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 catalysts using [Bmim][NTf2] and [Bmpyr][NTf2]. The selection of the two ILs considered: i) the very high stability of the NTf2 anion in water under oxidative conditions, and ii) to investigation of the effect of the nature of the cation (i.e. one IL with two N atoms in a five atoms cycle, and the other with one N atom in a six atoms cycle). Both ILs are immiscible with water. The effect of the gas phase composition has also been evaluated using O2 mixtures with N2, He, Ar and CO2."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of the catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of the catalysts OMS-2 was synthesized using the sol-gel method following the procedure reported by Duan et al. [49]. 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using a platinum nitrate solution (assay 15.14%, Johnson-Matthey, UK), as the platinum precursor. After impregnation, the material was dried at 120 °C for 12 h followed by calcination at 500 °C for 4 h [50]. The ionic liquids (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) were prepared following standard procedures from the bromide salt of the parent cation [51]. After synthesis they were dried for 24 h under vacuum (60 °C, 0.02 mbar) and characterized using 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP OES). 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Bmim][NTf2] [52] 1H NMR (500.13 MHz, DMSO-d 6, δ ppm, J Hz): 9.09 (s, 1H, H-2), 7.74 (m, 1H, H-4), 7.67 (m, 1H, H-5), 4.16 (t, 2H, 7.2 Hz, H-7), 3.85 (s, 3H, H-6), 1.78 (qv, 2H, 7.2 Hz, H-8), 1.27 (sextet, 2H, 7.5 Hz, H-9), 0.91 (t, 3H, 7.5 Hz, H-10) 13C NMR (125.77 MHz, DMSO-d 6, δ ppm): 136.5 (C-2), 123.6 (C-5), 122.2 (C-4), 119.5 (q, 321.97 Hz, C-11 (CF3)), 48.5 (C-7), 35.7 (C-6), 31.3 (C-8), 18.7 (C-9), 13.1 (C-10). 1-Butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Bmpyrr][NTf2] [52] 1H NMR (500.13 MHz, DMSO-d 6, δ ppm, J Hz): 3.48–3.40 (m, 4H, H-2, H-5), 3.29 (m, 2H, H-7), 2.97 (s, 3H, H-6), 2.08 (m, 4H, H-3, H-4), 1.68 (m, 2H, H-8), 1.32 (sextet, 2H, 7.4 Hz, H-9), 0.93 (t, 3H, 7.4 Hz, H-10).13C NMR (125.77 MHz, DMSO-d 6, δ ppm): 119.5 (q, 321.97 Hz, C-11 (CF3)), 63.4 (t, C-2, C-5), 62.9 (t, C-7), 47.5 (t, C-6), 24.9 (C-8), 21.1 (C-4, C-3), 19.3 (C-9), 13.4 (C-10). The SCILL-type catalysts, 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2] and 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2], were prepared by mixing a solution of 1.4 mL ionic liquid and 4.2 mL dichloromethane (1:3 (vol./vol.) ratio) with the catalyst (1 g of solid) (1:2 (w/w) ratio). The SCILL suspension was then stirred for 2 h followed by the solvent removal under vacuum, and drying for 24 h under vacuum (333.15 K, 0.02 mbar) [52]."
3,Characterization of the catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of the catalysts The surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter were determined from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010. Prior the nitrogen adsorption, the samples were out gassed at 120 °C, under vacuum, for 24 h. The particle size distribution of the solids was measured at 25 °C using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) in an aqueous dispersion with a Mastersizer 2000, Malvern Instruments, using the Mie scattering formalism. H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker UltraShield 500 MHz spectrometer, operating at 11.74 T, corresponding to the resonance frequency of 500.13 MHz for the 1H nucleus, equipped with a direct detection for nuclei probe head (BBO) and field gradients on Z axis. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm, using TMS as an internal standard. Typical parameters for 1H NMR spectra were: 45° pulse, 8.30 s acquisition times, 8.01 kHz spectral window, 16 scans, 20 K data points delay time 1 s. The FID was processed prior to Fourier transformation. The resonance frequency for the 13C nucleus is 125.77 MHz, 45° pulse, 1.67 s acquisition times, 39.68 kHz spectral window, 1024 scans, 20 K data points delay time 1 s. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with a Shimadzu XRD 7000 diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) at a scanning speed of 0.10° min−1 in the 5–90° 2θ range. Leaching of metals from the catalyst was monitored by induced coupled plasma analysis on an Agilent Technologies 715 ICP-OES apparatus. XPS analysis was carried out using Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD apparatus equipped with monochromated Al Kα X-ray source, a charge neutralizer and a hemispherical electron energy analyser with a pass energy of 160 eV. Background subtraction was performed using a Shirley background and CasaXPS software was employed to treat the data. The XPS was referenced to the aliphatic C 1s feature at 284.8 eV. Diffuse reflectance infra-red Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) were obtained from the accumulation of 400 scans in the domain 400–4000 cm−1 were recorded using a NICOLET 4700 spectrometer with diffuse reflectance accessory. DRIFT spectrawere refined by subtracting the spectrum of KBr used as background. Raman analysis was carried out with a Horiba Jobin Yvon - Labram HR UV − vis-NIR Raman microscope spectrometer at 633 nm with a beam diameter of 1.0 + 5% mm; a spot diameter of 0.5 mm and spatial resolution of 0.35 mm. SEM images were obtained using a Quanta FEG 250 Scanning Electron Microscope. The samples were prepared sonicating the material for 15 min then mounting on a specimen stub equipped with double sided tape. SEM analysis was then carried out under high vacuum and images of the sample recorded. TEM images were obtained using a Philips Tecnai F20D spectrometer with a field emission gun. The accelerating voltage was 200 kV and the resolution was 0.2 nm. Samples were prepared by dispersing in methanol and sonicating for 15 min. They were analyzed on holey carbon film copper grids."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99.8%) was carried out in mixtures of O2 with N2, He, Ar and CO2 as well as pure O2 (BOC, purity 99.9999%), Scheme 1 . The tests were performed under vigorous magnetic stirring (600 rpm) in an autoclave (reactor 316SS, HEL Group) with a capacity of 16 mL using 0.02 g OMS-2 equivalent catalyst (for the SCILL catalyst 0.03 g was used to take into account the 0.01 g of IL), 1 mmol benzyl alcohol and 5 mL deionized water. The autoclave was sealed and heated to 100 °C. The reactants and products were analyzed after 4 h of reaction by GCMS, after filtration and centrifugation, using a Trace GC 2000 system with MS detector (Thermo Electron Scientific Corporation, USA) incorporating a TR-WAX capillary column. The injection chamber was set up at 200 °C and the temperature in the detector cell was 270 °C."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization The XRD patterns of OMS-2, Fig. 1 (A1), present the typical lines corresponding to the manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve material [53]. No another diffraction lines due to the presence of any other MnxOy phases were detected. The XRD of 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 (A2) displayed no diffraction lines associated with Pt. Further deposition of ionic liquids onto the catalyst (5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2] (A3) and 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2] (A4)) did not lead to the appearance of any new diffraction lines or any shift in the existing features. The absence of any chemical change associated with the interaction of the support and ionic liquids was also confirmed by the DRIFT spectra, Fig. 2 . The DRIFT spectra of OMS-2 and 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 in the region 800–400 cm−1 showed the typical absorption bands of cryptomelane [15,53,54]. In addition, the spectrum of [Bmim][NTf2] show the typical absorption bands with an OH stretch at 3280 cm−1 and an OH bend at 1660 cm−1 [55]. [Bmpyr][NTf2] showed bands at 529, 570, 619, 1054, 1139, 1197, 1348, 1474 and 2966 cm−1 [56]. The bands at 570 and 1054 cm−1 are assigned to the out of plane bending of N and SO symmetric stretching weakly coupled with SN asymmetric stretching, respectively. The bands at 1139 and 1197 cm−1 correspond to the CF stretching and CF symmetric bending. The bands at 2881 and 2966 cm−1 correspond to symmetric and asymmetric CH stretching modes in the cation. No changes in the frequencies or relative intensities of the bands were found on deposition of the IL on the catalyst. The Raman spectra of OMS-2 and 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2, Fig. 3 (A1, A2), show three main contributions at 183, 576 and 636 cm−1 which are in accordance with literature reports for OMS-2 [57,58]. The band at 180 cm−1 corresponds to the deformation mode of the metal-oxygen chain of Mn–O–Mn, while the bands at 576 and 636 cm−1 correspond to the stretching modes of the Mn–O lattice. The spectra collected for the SCILL catalysts (A3, A4) showed a small shift of the band from 636 to 639 cm−1 that provides an evidence for the absence of a significant chemical change following the interaction of the IL and the catalyst. Furthermore the supported IL showed no noticeable changes in the NMR spectra [52]. XPS analysis of the SCILL catalysts showed no significant changes in the binding energies of the Pt 4f7/2 level (74.9 eV) compared with the free IL Pt/OMS-2 (74.8 eV). They typically correspond to PtO2 [2]. The oxidation state of Pt has not been affected by the reaction. The same behavior is highlighted by the comparison of the C 1s XPS binding energies of 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2]/pure ionic liquid [Bmim][NTf2] namely C aliphatic chain: 284.8/284.7 eV; N bonded C aliphatic chain: 285.6/285.9 eV; CC*N imidazolium ring: 286.9/286.5 eV; NC*N imidazolium ring: 286.9/287.1 eV and –SO2-CF3: 293.0/292.6 eV [2,52,59]. Moreover, in the case of Mn there are no changes in the binding energies following deposition of the ionic liquid layer. At 641.7 eV is positioned the Mn 2p3/2 photoelectron peak assigned to the Mn4+. The peak at a binding energy of 529.2 eV is assigned of lattice oxygen (O2−) and the peak at 532.2 eV is characteristic to the surface oxygen ions with lower valence as well as in the hydroxyl form [2,50]. The BET surface area was 59.0 m2 g−1 and 0.16 cm3 g−1 pore volume for OMS-2. The presence of platinum led to a decrease in the surface area to 48.5 m2 g−1 and pore volume to 0.11 cm3 g−1 [50]. Both SCILL catalysts display the ionic liquid loading ε, pore filling degree α and the layer thickness sIL [60] approximately identical (5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2] ε = 50%, α = 19%, sIL = 28 nm; 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2] ε = 50%, α = 19.5%, sIL = 29 nm). Therefore, pores are not fully filled with the ionic liquid; however, the IL is present as a multilayer. It should be noted that it is likely that for a filling degree of 19%, the small pores are likely to be completely filled [60]. SEM and TEM images for OMS-2 and 5%wt Pt/OMS-2 are shown in Fig. 4 . SEM images for both materials OMS-2 (a) and 5%Pt/OMS-2 (b), both materials showed the characteristic nano-rod like morphology of OMS-2. There is no notable difference between the OMS-2 and the 5%wt Pt/OMS-2 samples. The nano-rods range approximately in size from 160 to 240 nm in length and ∼20 nm in width. The TEM image of 5%Pt/OMS-2 (d) showed uniform distribution of spherical Pt nanoparticles of mean diameter ∼1.2 nm present on the surface of OMS-2 molecular sieves. The DLS measurements, Fig. 5 showed an aggregation of the particles under working solvent conditions. The aggregation of the catalysts particles in water was different as a function of the type of the IL producing the SCILLs. 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 aggregated in larger particles than the two SCILL catalysts showing a protecting effect of the IL shell (80.27 μm versus 43.15 μm and 49.48 μm, respectively). Between the two ILs, [Bmim][NTf2] afforded smaller particles than [Bmpyr][NTf2]."
7,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests Makwana et al. [61] suggested that on OMS-2 this oxidation reaction occurs following an Mars–van Krevelen mechanism involving two steps: i) oxidation of the substrate by the oxygen emerged from the solid lattice, and ii) re-oxidation of the solid with molecular oxygen. Accordingly, in the first step Mn4+ is reduced to Mn2+ and re-oxidized to Mn4+ the second step. The analysis of the reaction products indicated only benzaldehyde and benzoic acid, irrespective of the reaction conditions. Using 5 atm O2 at 100 °C, the OMS-2 support exhibited a small activity (ca. 20% conversion after 4 h) but after the addition of 5 wt% platinum 100% conversion was observed, Fig. 6 A. The selectivity to aldehyde and acid was not influenced by the presence of Pt with 94% aldehyde and 6% acid found for both OMS-2 and 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2. For the SCILL catalysts the activity is influenced by the presence of the IL with the addition of [Bmim][NTf2] to the 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 leading to a decrease in conversion (47%) with no change in the selectivity. A smaller decrease was observed on addition of [Bmpyr][NTf2] (81%) with an increase in the selectivity to the acid from 6% to 25% with the balance aldehyde. Replacing 5 atm oxygen with 25 atm of 20% O2 in N2 (i.e. the equivalent partial pressure of O2), Fig. 6B, did not affect the activity of OMS-2 or 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 but did decrease the selectivity towards aldehyde from 94% to 83% for OMS-2 and to 39% for 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2, respectively. Interestingly, whilst the conversion and selectivity over the 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2] remained similar for each gas atmosphere, a significant increase in conversion was observed for 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2] from 47% to 80% with a decrease in selectivity to the aldehyde from 94% to 82%. To estimate the influence of the diffusion upon the reaction rate in the investigated oxidation, at 5 atm O2, the Weisz–Prater criterion [62] has been calculated for all the investigated solid catalysts, using Eq. (1). (1) N W - P = R ∙ ρ p ∙ R p 2 C s ∙ D e f where: R is the reaction rate, ρp is the catalyst particle density (g/cm3), Rp is the catalyst particle radius, Cs is the reactant concentration at the particle surface and Def is the effective diffusivity, calculated according to Levenspiel [63]. The values of this criterion smaller than 0.3 confirm the absence of any pore diffusion limitations (OMS-2 - 0.03·10−6; 5% Pt/OMS-2 - 0.16·10−6; 5% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2] - 0.07·10−6; 5% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2] - 0.13·10−6). Besides this, the solubility of the reactants through the ionic liquid layer (Henry's constant) exerts an important influence upon the catalytic properties of SCILL materials (further exemplified in Fig. 9). Fig. 7 presents the time evolution of the conversion for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of SCILL catalysts, at 5 atm O2. It corresponds to a linear increase of the conversion, with a more pronounced decrease in the selectivity to benzaldehyde for 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2] than for the 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2] catalyst. However, while the conversion reached a plateau after 9 h, the selectivity continued to deplete in the favor of benzoic acid. This is more evident for 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2]. For the SCILL catalysts, the increase of the O2 pressure from 5 atm to 25 atm, Fig. 8 , corresponds to a gradual increase in conversion reaching 81% for 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2], and 96% for 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2] at the highest pressure. Under the same conditions, the selectivity towards aldehyde decreased from 93% to 80% for 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2] and from 76% to 68% for 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2]. As expected for a consecutive reaction, the lower conversions lead to the higher selectivity of the aldehyde. In order to evaluate any changes in the catalysts following reaction, XRD, Fig. 1(B1–B4), and Raman spectra, Fig. 3(B1–B4), were collected for used solids after the oxidation of benzyl alcohol under 25 atm O2. They confirmed that OMS-2 has been not altered (B1). However, for the 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 catalyst (B2), a significant decrease in the intensity of diffraction lines of the cryptomelane structure accompanied by the presence of new lines assigned to Mn3O4 [48], which have been indexed to those of hausmannite (a complex oxide of manganese containing both di- and tri-valent manganese, Mn2+ Mn3+ 2O4), was observed. In contrast, although both the SCILL catalysts, (5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2] (B3) and 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2] (B4)), also show XRD features corresponding to Mn3O4 their intensity was significantly lower than that of the 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 sample in the absence of the IL indicating that the IL enhances the structural stability of the catalyst. In all cases, the ICP-OES analysis detected no leaching of metals from the catalysts (K, Pt, Mn). In addition, whilst there was a change in the OMS-2 structure, features associated with Pt species were observed following reaction. Raman spectra of the catalyst post reaction, Fig. 3 (B1-B4), showed a shift in the position of the band from 576 to 568 cm−1 and of that at 639 to 643 cm−1 which is also consistent with the stretching modes of MnO lattice undergoing modification during reaction. The higher activity for the 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2] in the presence of 25 atm 20% O2 in N2 compared with the 5 atm of 100% O2 indicates that the presence of diluent gas can affect the conversion and selectivity observed. This behavior has been observed previously [64]. In order to establish the influence of the inert gas on the catalytic activity of the SCILL catalysts, reactions in the presence of different inert (He, Ar, N2) or reactive CO2 gas mixtures were performed. Fig. 9A shows that for 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2], the catalyst showed an increase of the activity when the gas composition changed from inert or reactive gas / O2 for all gas pressures in the same order: He > Ar > N2 > CO2 with the largest change observed between CO2 and N2 and a small change observed between Ar and He. The changes associated with the change in the inert gas may be associated with competition of the gas solubility between O2 and the inert within the IL leading to changes in O2 solubility. For example, the solubility of N2 in the pure IL is higher than that of Ar (1 atm and 70 °C, the Henry's constant of N2 is KH/105Pa = 3064 versus KH/105Pa = 2707 of Ar), [65] which may result in a decrease in O2 solubility for the N2 gas mixture compared with Ar. In the case of CO2, its very high solubility in ILs [66] may account for a large decrease in the solubility of oxygen and, therefore, smaller conversions. The effect of the CO2 may also be to interact with the OMS-2 leading to reduced surface oxygen mobility and a decrease in the ability to undergo the Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism. In addition, with increasing O2 partial pressure the conversion increased in line with the results shown in Fig. 8. The selectivity to aldehyde decreased with the increase of conversion, as expected. It should be noted that whilst similar trends, especially comparing CO2 and the inert gases as the diluent gas, were also observed for the 5% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2], Fig. 9B, i.e. on changing the cation, the influence of the change in the inert gas is smaller. This may be associated with the water content of the IL in each case which will change the solubility of the gases significantly and varies from saturation values of 0.252 (expressed in water mole fraction at 23 °C) [67] and 0.2568 [68] in the [Bmpyr][NTf2] and [Bmim][NTf2], respectively. The size of the catalytic aggregates plays also a role in this oxidation. Larger particles led to higher conversions of the substrate (5 wt% Pt/OMS-2 > 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2] > 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2]), Fig. 6A. The selectivity of the catalysts has been only influenced by the nature of IL. The composition of the oxidative atmosphere has an influence only for the case of nitrogen. For the same conversion, i.e. 82%, replacing air (where the selectivity to aldehyde changed from 84.6% (5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2]) to 77.4% (5 wt% Pt/OMS-2/[Bmpyr][NTf2]) led to close selectivities. With He/O2 or Ar/O2 mixture (the same molar ratio) this was pretty similar (in He 83.3% / 82.9% and Ar 75.2% / 75.6%). Pt/OMS-2/[Bmim][NTf2] can be easily separated by a simple filtration and can be reused several times. Thus, working at 5 atm O2, we found no visible changes for the first three successive cycles. After that, the conversion starts to decrease till 90% from the initial value. However, the selectivity remained almost unchanged."
8,Conclusions,"The cryptomelane form of manganese oxide catalyst, OMS-2, exhibits a low catalytic activity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of air or molecular oxygen as oxidants. The presence of only 5 wt % platinum led to a total conversion of benzyl alcohol. The thin ILs layer, ([Bmim][NTf2] or [Bmpyr][NTf2]), covering both the support and 5 wt% Pt/OMS-2, modifies the selectivity to benzaldehyde. Under the catalytic conditions the catalysts nanoparticles aggregate, and the aggregation depended on the nature of IL. [Bmim][NTf2] preserved particles with smaller dimensions. However, the application of the Weisz–Prater criterion confirmed the absence of diffusional constraints in all the cases. Using SCILL catalysts, the increase of the oxygen pressure led to an increase in the conversion in the detriment of selectivity. The presence of platinum on the surface results in changes of OMS-2 with the formation of Mn3O4. The presence of the ionic liquid on the surface of SCILL reduces the degradation of the support structure. Different mixture such as N2, He, Ar, CO2 / O2 led to significant changes in selectivity and conversion indicating that the oxygen solubility in the IL may be controlled by the diluent gas and has an important effect on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol."
