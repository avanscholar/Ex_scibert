0,Introduction,"Concerns about global warming have increased interest in hydrogen as a fuel since 1990s because it produces only water instead of greenhouse gases when combusted, generating a higher energy yield (122kJ/g) by 2.75 times than hydrocarbon fuels. In addition, H 2 can be directly used to produce electricity through fuel cells [1–3]. Current production of H 2 can be largely divided into physico-chemical and biological methods. Physico-chemical methods require electricity derived from fossil-fuel combustion; thus, they are energy-intensive and expensive. However, biological methods are potentially more attractive, especially if organic wastewater or biomass could be used as a substrate [4,5]. Biological methods are split into photosynthetic and fermentative processes. A lot of researches have focused on photosynthetic process, but it has many shortcomings such as low solar-energy conversion efficiency and low production rate [6]. On the other hand, fermentative process has advantages such as fast production rate, technical simpleness, waste reduction and no requirement of additional light energy. The following Eqs. (i) and (ii) simply describe the reactions involved in fermentative hydrogen production from organic substances. Since anaerobic bacteria do not require light energy, the decomposition of substrates is incomplete and organic acids remain. Although main metabolites are acetate and butyrate, butyrate is more dominant because of its lower Gibbs free energy value and involved enzyme activity [2,6]. (i) Glucose + 2 H 2 O → 2 Acetate + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 , Δ G = - 184.2 kJ , (ii) Glucose → Butyrate + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 , Δ G = - 257.1 kJ . However, there are some limitations in fermentative H 2 production, such as: (1) Only 10–20% of the energy potential in substrates is recoverable as H 2 due to the limited metabolic energy derived from H 2 fermentation [1]; (2) Satisfactory stability for fermentative H 2 production has not yet been obtained [7]. To overcome these problems, researches are made on especially about operating parameters such as pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), carbon source, etc. [4,8,9]. Partial pressure or H 2 in the liquid phase is one of the key factors affecting fermentative H 2 production. Generally, it is known that high H 2 partial pressure has a negative effect on H 2 production by decreasing the activity of hydrogenase and making the H 2 production reaction thermodynamically unfavorable [10–15]. To decrease H 2 partial pressure, gas sparging could be one of the useful methods [14] that has other beneficial effect on reactor performance by improving mixing [15]. However, the researches on H 2 partial pressure and gas sparging were mainly undertaken on batch experiments not continuous operation. This work was, therefore, performed to investigate the effect of gas sparging on continuous fermentative hydrogen production. The key operational parameters, such as hydrogen yield, metabolic products, microbial communities, etc., were examined in completely stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) using various sparging gases (internal biogas, N 2 and CO 2 ) at a wide range of flow rates (100, 200, 300 and 400ml/min)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge The seed sludge was taken from an anaerobic digester in a local wastewater treatment plant. The pH, alkalinity, and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the sludge were 7.6, 2.83g CaCO 3 / L , and 5.3g/L, respectively. It was heat-treated at 90 ∘ C for 15min to inactivate hydrogen consumers and to harvest spore-forming anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium sp. [9]."
3,Substrate,"2.2 Substrate Sucrose of 20g COD/L was used as a substrate. Concentrations of NH 4 Cl , KH 2 PO 4 , and FeCl 2 · 4 H 2 O were added for COD:N:P:Fe ratio of 100:5:1:0.33 [7]. Feed also contained the following nutrients (in mg/L): peptone 1000; NaHCO 3 1000; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O 100; CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O 75; Na 2 MoO 4 · 4 H 2 O 0.01; H 3 BO 3 0.05; MnCl 2 · 4 H 2 O 0.5; ZnCl 2 0.05; CuCl 2 0.03; NiCl 2 · 6 H 2 O 0.05; CoCl 2 · 2 H 2 O 0.5; Na 2 SeO 3 0.05 [8,16]."
4,Reactor operation,"2.3 Reactor operation In this study, CSTR was used of which the working volume was 5.0L (325mm high by 140mm ID). The chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate was maintained at 40g/Ld during the whole period of operation, which corresponded to 12h of HRT. The reactors were mixed by mechanical stirring at 100rpm. Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic of an external gas ( N 2 and CO 2 ) sparging reactor, while Fig. 2 the schematic of an internal biogas sparging reactor. A dispersion plate was placed at the bottom of the reactor for efficient gas sparging. The pH was kept at 5.3 ± 0.1 using pH sensor, pH controller and 3M potassium hydroxide. Gas production was monitored by a wet gas meter (external gas sparging) [14] and the water displacement method [16] (internal biogas sparging) and then was corrected to standard temperature ( 0 ∘ C ) and pressure (760mmHg) (STP). All the experiments were conducted in a constant temperature room at 35 ± 1 ∘ C . After seeded with the heat-treated sludge, the reactors were operated without sparging for 40 days: 20 days of start-up period and 20 days of control. Subsequently, the reactors were operated under sparging conditions for 100 days. The sparging flow rate was increased stepwise from 100 to 400ml/min."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Hydrogen content in biogas was determined by a gas chromatography (GC, Gow Mac series 580) using a thermal conductivity detector and a 1.8 m × 3.2 mm stainless-steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A with N 2 as a carrier gas. The contents of CH 4 , N 2 , and CO 2 were measured using a GC of the same model noted previously with a 1.8 m × 3.2 mm stainless-steel column packed with porapak Q (80/100 mesh) using helium as a carrier gas. The temperatures of injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 90, and 50 ∘ C , respectively, in both GCs. VFA ( C 2 – C 6 ) and lactate were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Spectrasystem P2000) with an ultraviolet (210nm) detector and an 300 mm × 7.8 mm Aminex HPX-97H column using H 2 SO 4 of 0.005M as mobile phase. Aliphatic alcohol was determined using another HPLC (DX-600, Dionex) with an electrochemical detector (ED50A) and an 250 mm × 4 mm Dionex CarboPac PA10 column using NaOH of 0.01M as mobile phase. The liquid samples were pretreated with 0.45 μ m membrane filter before injection to both HPLCs. COD and VSS were measured according to Standard Methods [17]. Glucose concentration was determined by the colorimetric method of Dubois et al. [18]."
6,Microbial analysis,"2.5 Microbial analysis In order to analyze the microbial communities, the DNAs in the sludge sampled at each sparging condition were extracted using the Ultraclean Soil DNA Kit (Cat # 12800-50; Mo Bio Laboratory Inc., USA). The 16S rDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The region corresponding to positions 357 and 518 in the 16S rDNA of Escherichia coli was PCR-amplified using the forward primer EUB357f ( 5 ′ -CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG- 3 ′ ) with a GC clamp ( 5 ′ -CGCCCG CCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGGCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCC- 3 ′ ) at the 5 ′ end to stabilize the melting behavior of the DNA fragments and the reverse primer UNIV518r ( 5 ′ -ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG- 3 ′ ). PCR amplification was conducted in an automated thermal cycler (MWG-Bio TECH, Germany) using the protocol; that is, initial denaturation for 4min at 94 ∘ C , annealing for 40s at 55 ∘ C , extension for 1min at 72 ∘ C , followed by a final extension for 8min at 72 ∘ C . PCR mixtures had a final volume of 50 μ l of 10 × PCR buffer, 0.8mM MgSO 4 , 0.5mM of each primer, 0.1mM dNTP, 25pg template and 1U polymerase. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel in 1 × TAE for 30min for 50V, and then checked with ethidium bromide staining to confirm the amplification. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was carried out using the Dcode Universal Mutation Detection System (BioRad, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instruments. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1 × TAE buffer for 480min at 70V and 60 ∘ C on polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) containing a linear gradient ranging from 40% to 60% denaturant. After electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 30min, and then visualized on UV transilluminator. Most of bands were excised from DGGE polyacrylamide gel for 16S rDNA sequencing. DNAs were eluted from the excised bands by immersing them in 20 μ l of Tris EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for one day, and then PCR-amplified with the forward primer EUB357f without a GC clamp and the reverse primer UNIV518r. After PCR amplification, PCR products were purified with using Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold (MILLIPORE com., USA). All the strands of the purified PCR products were sequenced with primers EUB357f by ABIPRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Search of the GenBank database was conducted using the BLAST program."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Production of hydrogen,"3.1 Production of hydrogen Hydrogen yield is a good indicator to the effectiveness of H 2 production. Theoretical H 2 yield is 2.0mol H 2 / mol hexose added when butyrate is the main by-product [2]. Continuous H 2 yields in various experimental conditions are illustrated in Fig. 3 . After 60 days of no sparging and adaptation period, stable H 2 production was observed in all the sparging reactors. Hydrogen yield increased in the order of internal biogas sparging, N 2 sparging and CO 2 sparging. Table 1 summarizes the average experimental data obtained at each sparging condition. The sparging with external gases of N 2 and CO 2 showed higher H 2 yield and specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) than the control of no sparging and internal biogas sparging. It meant that the decrease of H 2 partial pressure by external gas sparging had a beneficial effect on H 2 fermentation. Unlike N 2 sparging, when CO 2 sparging rate increased from 100 to 300ml/min, H 2 yield increased from 0.91 to 1.20mol H 2 / mol hexose added and from 1.40 to 1.68mol H 2 / mol hexose consumed . The best performance was, therefore, obtained by CO 2 sparging at 300ml/min, in spite of low glucose removal efficiency and biomass concentration."
9,Characteristics of metabolic products,"3.2 Characteristics of metabolic products Electrons from substrate were converted to liquid state by-products including VFAs and solvents, H 2 and biomass. Table 2 summarizes the overall COD balance and product distribution. The COD of biomass was calculated by assuming that it was equivalent to particulate COD. CO 2 sparging showed that about 30% (4540– 6980 mg COD/L) of substrate was not degraded but remained in the effluent, and that the total values of the liquid state by-products were the lowest in all the reactors due to the low biomass concentrations. Nevertheless, CO 2 sparging resulted in the highest H 2 production indicating that the substrate was preferably used for the production of H 2 rather than synthesis of microorganisms. The fermentation of organics to generate H 2 always accompanies with the production of VFAs and solvents. Although main metabolic products were butyrate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, butyrate concentration was the highest in all the experiments indicating that the reactions were butyrate fermentation type [2]. In N 2 and CO 2 sparging, butyrate concentration was relatively higher than other two sparging cases. It meant that the decrease of H 2 partial pressure enhanced the activity of hydrogenase and making the H 2 production reaction thermodynamically favorable. However, CO 2 sparging showed much higher H 2 yield and butyrate composition than N 2 sparging. There might be another beneficial effect in CO 2 sparging apart from lowering down H 2 partial pressure, which would be discussed in Section 3.4. Butyrate composition was 70% in the CO 2 sparging higher than other experimental conditions of 40%. Acetate and lactate compositions were the lowest in CO 2 sparging. The ratio of butyrate to acetate concentration (B/A) was frequently used as an indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of H 2 production when using mixed microflora [19,20]. The average B/A ratios were 1.47 in control, 1.64–1.73 in internal biogas sparging, 1.49–2.12 in N 2 gas sparging and 6.08–9.49 in CO 2 gas sparging, respectively. The B/A ratio was the highest in CO 2 sparging with maximum H 2 production. Fig. 4 clearly shows the linear relationship between H 2 yield (mol H 2 /mol hexose consumed ) and B/A ratio with root mean square of 0.97. These results suggested that butyrate should be dominant in the metabolic products for higher H 2 production and that CO 2 sparging made the environmental conditions favorable to butyrate production while it suppressed the acetate production. Generally, it is known that 2mol of H 2 are produced with the production of 1mol of butyrate or acetate and that there is no direct relationship between H 2 production and lactate or ethanol production. However, 1mol of H 2 is consumed when 1mol of propionate or formate is formed. Therefore, theoretical H 2 production could be estimated from the analysis of metabolic products as shown below [21]. (iii) Theoretical H 2 production ( mol / d ) = 2 Butyrate ( mol / d ) + 2 Acetate ( mol / d ) - Propionate ( mol / d ) - Formate ( mol / d ) . In this study, formate concentration was insignificantly low enough to ignore in Eq. (iii). Comparison of theoretical and practical H 2 productions is given in Table 3 . In CO 2 sparging, these were little different, but the difference was significant in other experimental conditions. The real H 2 generation was about 2 times lower than theoretical H 2 production in three cases, where acetate concentrations were much higher than that in CO 2 sparging. It indicated that most of acetate was produced without H 2 generation when using mixed microflora. Eqs. (iv) and (v) are the reactions involved in acetate production without H 2 generation, which were supported by the existence of acetate-producing bacteria which could consume H 2 and CO 2 with the degradation of glucose, lactate and succinate [22–24]. (iv) 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → Acetate + 2 H 2 O , Δ G = - 105 kJ , (v) Glucose → 3 Acetate , Δ G = - 311 kJ ."
10,Comparison of performance with previous research,"3.3 Comparison of performance with previous research Table 4 shows the comparison of performance data obtained in this research with those in previous studies. At optimal condition of CO 2 sparging at 300ml/min, the results were 1.68mol H 2 / mol hexose consumed of H 2 yield, 8.32 of B/A ratio, and 6.89L H 2 / g VSS/d of SHPR. According to Mizuno et al. [14], H 2 yield increased from 1.06 to 1.46 by N 2 sparging along with 9.7% increase of butyrate production. In this study, however, H 2 yield increased from 0.77 to 1.68 by CO 2 sparging, accompanied by 38.7% increase of butyrate production. It revealed that carbon dioxide was more efficient than nitrogen as a sparging gas in H 2 fermentation. Chang and Lin [16] and Lin and Jo [25] operated an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor and an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR), respectively, for retaining high biomass concentration. However, H 2 yield and SHPR of their studies were much lower than this study [16,25]. It meant that most of the microorganisms obtained in CSTR with CO 2 gas sparging consisted of H 2 -producing bacteria, which resulted from a positive effect of high CO 2 partial pressure on fermentative H 2 production."
11,Microbial analysis,"3.4 Microbial analysis Fig. 5 illustrates the DGGE profiles of the 16S rDNA gene fragment amplified from the sludges sampled in control, internal biogas sparging, N 2 sparging and CO 2 sparging. In case of sparging experiments, the sludges were taken at the flow rate of 300ml/min. The major bands were excised and purified to determine the sequence. Tables 5 and 6 show the results of the sequence affiliation, and isolated microorganisms and their characteristics in each sparging condition. In total, 17 bands and nine species were detected. Only three species appeared in CO 2 sparging, such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (band 2), C. proteolyiticum (band 6) and C. acidisoli (bands 10, 14 and 15) which were known as H 2 -producing bacteria. In addition to above three species, C. butyricum, C. pasteurianum, C. collagenovorans, C. homopropionicum, Gluconacetobacter europaeus and Lactobacillus sp. appeared in other conditions. C. butyricum, C. pasteurianum and C. collagenovorans are also known as H 2 -producing bacteria. However, it was reported that C. pasteurianum had nickel-containing CO dehydrogenase which worked as a central role of the acetyl-CoA pathway of acetogens. It means that C. pasteurianum can grow acetogenically with consuming H 2 and CO 2 . C. homopropionicum is acetate- and propionate-producing bacteria by degrading lactate. Gl. europaeus is known as a N 2 -fixing microorganism which produces acetate using N 2 and sugar as co-substrate. Lactobacillus sp. is lactate-producing bacteria from sugar and has an inhibitory effect on other microorganisms [34]. The isolated microorganisms in N 2 sparging were very similar to control and internal biogas sparging. It indicated that the increase of H 2 production by N 2 gas sparging owed to effect of lowering H 2 partial pressure without changing microbial community. However, the isolated microorganisms in CO 2 sparging with higher H 2 production were quite different from other experimental conditions as the following: (1) Simple microbial community; (2) No microorganisms consuming H 2 , such as Gl. europaeus and C. pasteurianum; (3) No microorganisms being competitive with or inhibitory to H 2 -producing bacteria, such as Gl. europaeus and Lactobacillus sp. It was assumed that low glucose removal and biomass concentration were due to simple microbial community, and that relatively lower acetate and lactate production with higher H 2 evolution was caused by the suppression of H 2 -consuming bacteria and competitive microorganisms. At high CO 2 partial pressure, the excess penetration of free CO 2 to cell inside may occur speculating that it might cause damage to cell membrane, pH decrease and consumption of additional ATP by activating PEP carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase [35]. According to Lee et al. [36], there was the improvement of reactor performance until 0.6atm of CO 2 partial pressure, but the drastic deterioration of the performance was observed at over 0.7atm of CO 2 partial pressure along with the decrease of biomass activity producing methane or acetate. In CO 2 sparging, the CO 2 partial pressure was above 0.85atm and dissolved CO 2 and H CO 3 - concentrations, proportional to CO 2 partial pressure, were above 2.24 × 10 - 2 M and 2.15 × 10 - 3 M , respectively, according to Eqs. (vi) and (vii) in all the cases. (vi) CO 2 ( aq ) = K H · pCO 2 , (vii) HCO 3 - ( aq ) = K 1 · CO 2 ( aq ) H + , where K H is the Henry's law constant at 35 ∘ C , 2.63 × 10 - 2 M / atm , pCO 2 is the CO 2 partial pressure (atm), K 1 is the first acidity constant at 35 ∘ C , 4.83 × 10 - 7 M / atm and H + is the hydrogen ion concentration, 10 - 5.3 M at pH = 5.3 . Therefore, high CO 2 partial pressure had little effect on H 2 -producing bacteria but inhibitory effect on other microorganisms such as acetogens and lactic acid bacteria which were competitive with H 2 -producing bacteria."
12,Conclusions,"(1) The sparging with external gases of N 2 and CO 2 showed higher H 2 yield with more butyrate production than the control of no sparging and internal biogas sparging. It indicated that the decrease of H 2 partial pressure worked effectively on H 2 fermentation by increasing the activity of hydrogenase and making the H 2 production reaction thermodynamically favorable. (2) The best performance was obtained by CO 2 sparging at 300ml/min. It resulted in the highest H 2 yield of 1.68mol H 2 / mol hexose consumed and the maximum specific H 2 production rate of 6.89L H 2 / g VSS/day, in spite of low glucose removal efficiency and biomass concentration. (3) The analysis of metabolic products showed little difference between theoretical and practical H 2 production in CO 2 sparging, but large difference in other experimental conditions where acetate concentrations were higher than that in CO 2 sparging. It indicated that most of acetate was produced without H 2 generation when using mixed microflora, which was supported by the existence of acetate-producing bacteria which could consume H 2 and CO 2 with the degradation of glucose, lactate and succinate. (4) Compared to N 2 sparging, there was another beneficial effect in CO 2 sparging. High CO 2 partial pressure had little effect on H 2 -producing bacteria but inhibitory effect on other microorganisms such as acetogens and lactic acid bacteria which were competitive with H 2 -producing bacteria. Thus, only H 2 -producing bacteria, such as C. tyrobutyricum, C. proteolyticum and C. acidisoli, were isolated in CO 2 sparging based on 16S rDNA analysis by PCR-DGGE."
