0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting for clean energy H2 using solar energy has been considered to be a promising method to deal with the rapid consumption of fossil fuels and growing environmental pollution [1–3]. Since the first report of photocatalytic splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes in 1972 by Honda and Fujishima [4], many high efficient photocatalysts for water splitting have been reported in the past few decades [5–11]. However, the majority of these photocatalysts due to wide band gap are primarily active for H2 production under UV irradiation, which present in only a small portion of total solar energy [12–14]. For enhancing the conversion efficiency of solar energy, the development of visible-light-responsive photocatalytic with high photocatalytic activity is still urgent. CdS with a narrow band gap (Eg = 2.4 eV) is able to absorb solar light up to 520 nm (λ = 1240/Eg) [15–17]. In additional, because the potential of the valence band (VB) of CdS which is composed of S 2p orbit is comparative negative (high), the potential of the conduction band (CB) of CdS is very negative (high), which possesses strong reduction ability for H+ to H2. However, the photocatalytic activity of pure CdS for water splitting is very low due to the fast charge carrier recombination on its surface as well as lack of the active sites for H2 evolution. To reduce the photogenerated carriers recombination, noble metals such as Pt, Pd as cocatalysts were loaded on the surface of CdS [18]. However, taking into account the high cost and scarcity of noble metals, the development of cheap and high performance cocatalysts is indispensable for the large scale application of photocatalytic water splitting. Recently, it has reported that noble-metal-free cocatalysts, such as Graphene [19], MoS2 [20–22], NiS [23], Ni(OH)2 [24], exhibit excellent performance towards improving the photocatalytic activity of CdS, showing that noble-metal-free cocatalysts can be used as substitutes for noble metal cocatalysts in photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. Most recently, cobalt-based compounds such as Co8S9 [25], Co(OH)2 [26], CoP [27] and CoPy [28] have been proved to be effective cocatalysts for promoting the H2 evolution activity. Zhang et al. [25] reported that Co8S9/CdS nanocomposites worked as a redox-mediator-free Z-scheme system can effectively separate the photoexcited charge carries and achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity. Yu group [26] reported that photoexcited electrons in the CB of CdS can effectively transfer to Co(OH)2 and reduce partial Co2+ to Co+ and Co0, thus accelerating the separation of charge carriers of CdS and leading to enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution. However, up to now, the effort of Co0 loading on CdS directly as well as the investigation of its performance has not yet been made. Herein, we load Co on CdS nanorod by an in situ photodeposited method for high efficient H2 production under visible light. The Co nanoparticles as active sites for H2 evolution to remarkably enhance photocatalytic activity were verified. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution of Co/CdS with different contents of Co loading was tested under visible light irradiation. The roles of Co in promoting the photocatalytic activity for water splitting were discussed as well."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and NH2CSNH2 were procured from Kermel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China. C4H6CoO4 and H2PtCl6 were procured from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China. (NH4)2SO3·5H2O was procured from Afla Aesar Co. Ltd, China. All materials were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. CdS nanorods served as photocatalyst were prepared by a solvothermal method [29]. Typically, 48 ml of 1,2-ethylenediamine(en), 3.15 g of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 2.30 g of NH2CSNH2 were added to a beaker, and reacted under stirred at room temperature for 30 min, then it was transferred into a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave, and was kept at 160 °C for 48 h. The obtained yellow product was separated from the solution, washed with distilled water and absolute alcohol, dried under 40 °C for 24 h in a vacuum furnace to obtain CdS nanorods. Loading Co on CdS was achieved by an in suit photodeposition method. 0.15 g CdS with 65 ml 0.2 mol/L (NH4)2SO3 aqueous solution containing a certain amount of C4H6CoO4 was put into a 350 ml Pyrex reaction cell. The reaction cell was deaerated by a vacuum pump before reactions. Under the irradiation by a 300 W Xe lamp, the electrons of CdS photogenerated by visible light (λ > 420 nm) reduced and loaded Co on the surface of CdS. After reaction 2 h, Co/CdS was collected by filtration and dried at 40 °C for 10 h. 0.5% Pt as a referenced cocatalyst was also prepared in the same way while replacing C4H6CoO4 with H2PtCl6. In this paper, the loading contents refer to the weight ratio (wt%) of cocatalysts and photocatalysts."
3,Characterization of photocatalysts,"2.2 Characterization of photocatalysts The crystal structure of the photocatalytic materials was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Bruker-AXS Germany, Cu Kα, λ = 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA). The UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were determined by a UV–vis spectrophotometer Lambda 950 (PerkinelmerPE, USA) and were converted to absorbance by the Kubelka–Munk method. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) measurements were conducted using a JEM-2100F (Japan). The surface electronic state was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Shimadzu-Kratos, Axis UltraDLD, Japan). All the binding energy (BE) values were calibrated by using the standard BE value of contaminant carbon (C1s = 284.8 eV) as a reference."
4,Eelectrochemical measurements,"2.3 Eelectrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements of LSV were performed using a glassy carbon electrode (3 mm diameter, 0.07 cm2) in 0.5 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous solution used as electrolyte [30]. Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All potentials in this study were converted into the potentials of reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)."
5,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.4 Photocatalytic reaction Photocatalytic reactions for water splitting were carried out in a 350 ml top irradiation Pyrex reaction cell at room temperature. A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an optical cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as the light source. The catalyst powder (0.05 g) was suspended in 0.5 mol/L (NH4)2SO3 aqueous solution (65 ml) by magnetic stirring. Prior to irradiation, the reactor was well-evacuated by a vacuum pump to remove the dissolved O2 and N2 in water. Generated hydrogen was analyzed by an on-line GC with TCD detector (Huaai, GC9560, China, MS-5A, argon as carrier gas)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,XRD and UV–vis DRS,"3.1 XRD and UV–vis DRS Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of Co/CdS composite materials with various Co loading contents. The XRD diffraction peaks of pure CdS locating at 24.9°, 26.5°, 28.2°, 36.6°, 43.8°, 48.8° could be indexed as (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3) planes of hexagonal phase. For any of Co/CdS composite samples, no characteristic diffraction peaks of Co or Co oxides were observed, regardless of Co and CdS weight ratio, which should be ascribed to weak crystallization and/or small size of Co particles. In addition, there is no shift of peak positions in each of the composite materials, suggesting Co only deposited on the surface of CdS instead of incorporating into its lattice. The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of Co/CdS composite materials with various Co loading contents are shown in Fig. 2 . The absorption band edge of CdS is near 520 nm, corresponding to band gap of 2.4 eV, which is the typically absorption edge of hexagonal phase. This result is also consistent with the XRD analysis. Of note, with the increase of Co loading contents, the new absorption of Co/CdS longer 520 nm can be observed, which should be assigned to absorption of Co. The result also indicates the Co were loaded on the photocatalysts successfully. In addition, compared to the pure CdS, the absorption band edges of Co/CdS at 520 nm have no obvious change, which is also because the Co are loaded on the surface of CdS rather than doped in its crystal lattice."
8,TEM analysis,"3.2 TEM analysis To investigate the morphologies of CdS and the distribution state of Co on the surface of CdS, TEM was employed and images of 1.0% CdS are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be found that CdS prepared by a solvothermal method shows nanorod morphology with widths of 30–60 nm and lengths of 300–800 nm (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, Co particles with diameter ca. 5 nm were deposited on the surface of CdS. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) maps of Co/CdS (Fig. 3c) exhibited that Co, Cd, S elements existed in Co/CdS, further revealing the Co were loaded on the surface successfully by an in situ photodeposition method. Additionally, the element content analysis of EDS (Fig. 3e) shows that the ratio of Co and Cd/S contents has not notable change at linear scanning range from 0 to 550 nm (green line in Fig. 3d), indicating that Co particles disperse on the surface of CdS homogeneously. To further investigate the surface chemical states of Co/CdS, the binding energies of elements were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 4 , the existence of Cd, S, Co and O elements are indexed from the survey spectrum. From high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS), the binding energies at 405.3 eV and 162.7 eV corresponding to Cd 3d5/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively, are indicative of typical Cd and S of CdS [31]. For Co 2p, the observed binding energy peak at 780.0 eV as well as the satellite peak at 786.5 eV should be ascribed to CoO based on previous report [32]. Remarkably, the expected Co metal (Co0) is not indexed from Co XPS because Co metal nanoparticles are extremely unstable exposure to atmosphere environmental and easily are oxidized to CoO."
9,Photocatalytic water splitting activity,"3.3 Photocatalytic water splitting activity Fig. 5 shows the rate of hydrogen evolution over Co/CdS photocatalysts with various Co loading amounts and 0.5% Pt/CdS as a comparison. The reaction was performed containing 0.05 g catalyst under visible light (λ > 420 nm) using (NH4)2SO3 as a sacrificial reagent. Pure CdS showed very low photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution (76 μmol h−1) due to the rapid recombination of photoexcited of carriers on the surface of CdS, even though the potential of conduction band of CdS is enough negative to reduce the H+ to H2 [33]. After Co loading, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate was significantly promoted. With the increase of loading amounts of Co, the photocatalytic activity gradually enhanced. The photocatalytic evolution rate of 1.0% Co/CdS was 1299 μmol h−1, even 17 times that of bare CdS, reaching 80% of that of 0.5%Pt/CdS. This result indicates that non-noble metal Co is a good substitute for noble metals in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Excessive Co loading amount will lead to a decrease of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate, because the Co on the surface of CdS block the absorption of light photon by CdS as well as become the recombination center of photoexcited carriers [34]. Generally speaking, to achieve photocatalytic water splitting, the photocatalytic materials need to meet the requirement of band gaps in addition to excellent separation of photoexcited electrons and holes [35]. Although the potential of CB of CdS is more negative than reduction potential of H+/H2, the photoexcited electrons and holes of CdS rapid recombine on its surface before the occurrence of reduction reaction, thus leading to low photocatalytic activity. After Co was photodeposited on the surface of CdS, Co worked as active sites enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. To further investigate the origin of Co on improving the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of CdS and Co/CdS was tested by a linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method. Fig. 6 shows the polarization curves of pure CdS and Co/CdS. It can be observed that, compared with pure CdS, Co/CdS samples display apparently enhanced current density of hydrogen evolution. This result indicates Co as cocatalysts can efficiently promote the photocatalytic activity of reduction of water to H2 [36]. Of note, the polarization curves of Co/CdS display lower overpotential of hydrogen evolution than that of pure CdS, suggesting that hydrogen evolution tend to taking place on the surface of Co/CdS due to lower energy barrier [37]. Moreover, it has reported that Pt, Au metal with high function as cocatalysts can format schottky barrier junction with CdS, thus promoting the migration of electrons from photocatalysts to cocatalysts [38]. Co metal possesses high work function (5.0 eV), which approaches that of Au and Pd (5.1 eV, 5.11 eV). Therefore, Co cocatalyst is able to contribute to the migration of photoexcited electrons of CdS to its surface, thus resulting in the separation of electrons and holes. To examine the point of view, the photoluminescence (PL) properties of CdS and 1%Co/CdS were measured because the occurrence of fluorescent light was related to the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. As shown in Fig. 7 , from the emission spectra with an excitation wavelength of 430 nm, the emission wavelength peaks of both CdS and 1%Co/CdS locate 540 nm. It is noteworthy that the PL emission intensity of 1%Co/CdS is much weaker than that of pure CdS, suggesting Co loaded on the surface of CdS effectively inhibits the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes [39,40]. Consequently, Co loading on CdS not only facilitates the separation of carriers, but reduces the overpotential of hydrogen evolution, thus promoting the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. Based on the analysis above, a potential mechanism of Co loading for promoting photocatalytic activity is proposed as Fig. 8 . Co2+ was reduced by photoexcited electrons to Co0 and loaded on the surface of CdS. The electrons of in CB of CdS could rapidly migrate to the surface of Co, while the holes in VB of CdS were retained on its surface, leading to the separation of electrons and holes. Meanwhile, owing to the low overpotential of hydrogen evolution on Co surface, the electrons on the Co surface lightly reduced the H+ to H2, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. To examine the stability of Co/CdS photocatalysts, three cycles of gas evolution on 1.0 % Co/CdS are shown in Fig. 9 . After a cycle running, the photocatalytic material was filtered and dried for next cycle. It can be found that, the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution decreased somewhat with the cycle running. The average hydrogen evolution rate of the 3th cycle decreased to 850.8 μmol h−1, which was 72.7% of original activity. The decreased activity might be attributed to the photocorrosion of CdS and the catalyst loss during filtration and washing process. Under the 18 h irradiation, the total amount of H2 is 18.1 mmol and the turnover numbers (TON) reaches 41.4, indicating that hydrogen is indeed generated in a photocatalytic reaction instead of chemical reaction process."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, non-noble metal Co as a cocatalyst was loaded on CdS for enhancing photocatalytic activity of water splitting by a simple and efficient in situ photodeposition method. Co particles loaded on CdS by a photoreduced process work as active sites for hydrogen evolution to enhance remarkably the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production, which not only facilitates the separation of carriers, but reduces the overpotential of hydrogen evolution. The highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of Co/CdS under visible light irradiation is 17 times of that of pure CdS and is 80% of that of 0.5%Pt/CdS when the amount of loading is 1.0 wt%. This work not only exhibits a pathway to obtain photocatalysts with high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production, but provides a possibility for the utilization of low cost Co as a substitute for noble metals in photocatalytic hydrogen production."
