0,Introduction,"Hydrogen sulfide is created from living beings and is a side product of various industrial processes, including paper industrial, and sewage treatment and exists certainly in environment (e.g., in volcanic gases and natural gas). Natural gas holds different extents of H2S from a few ppm to 28 wt% and with great levels of H2S, which is considered as sour gas. It is a hazardous air contaminant in natural gas treating, petroleum refineries and significant public health anxiety when released into the environment. The application of N.G in petrochemical and power supply industries is very important [1]. The existence of H2S in N.G has some nasty effects. This impurity can accelerate some difficulties during gas transportation such as corrosion of pipeline and equipment, the foundation of gas hydrates, and pressure drops in transmission. Thus, the removal of H2S from natural gas is necessary for industries [2–3]. In addition, according to the important influence of H2S as the chief constituent of greenhouse gas release on climate change and universal warming, recovery of H2S has become a global problem [4–5]. The membrane method as a clean, economical and new technique can be employed for gas separation, particularly H2S removal. Membrane technology has many benefits over normal process such as low energy intake and operating cost, clean method with easy operation and in recent years, membrane separation methods have been expanded from experimental to industrial scales [6]. The most essential characteristics of membrane are controlling the permeation rate of elements and different chemical components [7]. The elimination of H2S from sour gas, which is titled sweetening, is generally performed through amine absorption methods. But, membrane methods have also been employed in the past few decades based on several benefits. Also, the membrane units are modular and compact, which need less space and work at pretty low pressures. The major weaknesses of membrane processes are the fouling of them, the stability of membranes and the inaccessibility of appropriate membranes for particular processes [8]. There are some various kinds of membrane materials such as inorganic, organic and porous hybrid materials. Based on the modularizing difficulties, high cost of inorganic membranes and porous mixed materials [9–10], several studies have been done on the modification of polymers to produce synthetic polymeric membranes, which persist at high temperatures. Recently gas permeation process has been used for the removal of Hydrogen Sulfide from natural gas in industries and Hydrogen Sulfide and water could be separated from natural gas simultaneously. The improvement in penetration selectivity for methane-Hydrogen Sulfide is complicated because the interaction diameter of their molecules is very close. Many past researches have established the modern gas permeation theory; also, the solution-diffusion in gas permeation is still the accepted method in gas transmission with membranes. However, despite the availability of polymeric materials at that time, the membrane fabrication technology wasn't appropriate for making a suitable polymeric membrane for gas separation [11–12]. Polysulfone (PS) is a flexible and noticeable properties polymer, including chemical resistance, high glass transition temperature, thermal stability, mechanical strength and electrical insulation at wide-ranging temperatures. It is soluble in different nonvolatile solvents such as DMAC, DMF and N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) [13]. Some researchers such as Pourafshari et al., [14] have considered removing low concentrations of H2S from CH4 by Cardo-type polyimide and PPO membranes at various experimental circumstances. Their tests were performed at ambient temperature and pressures at 345–689 kPa. The mixed gas comprising 101–401 ppm of H2S in CH4 was applied. Their findings showed that in the presence of H2S, the permeance of CH4 dropped for the Cardo-type polyimide membrane, while it persisted comparatively fixed for PPO membrane. Furthermore, the separation ratio of H2S/CH4 was 4 and 6 for PPO and Cardo-type polyimide membranes, respectively. There are only a few published works that have used polymeric membranes for the separation of H2S acid gas and a few studies have been performed for separation of H2S from CH4, particularly the studies stated by Mohammadi et al., which the H2S/CH4 selectivities have been noted [15]. Valuable parts of this study are as the following: In an article provided by Ismail et al. [16], working pressure was 4 barg, while the maximum pressure in this study is 20 bar and the effects of pressure changes are also examined. In articles presented by Ismail et al., [16] and Bakhtiyari et al. [17], pure methane was used, while in this study, the sour natural gas as an industrial material was used. Madaeni et al. [18], have used from 20% PES in the NMP solvent in their investigation, while in this study various concentration of PS in two solvents of DMAC and DMF were employed. In an article presented by Zamani et al. [19], the temperature changes are not studied, while in this study, the temperature changes were also investigated. In this study Polysulfone was used with DMF and DMAC as different solvents and the effect of solvent quality on the performance of membranes was investigated. The selectivity and permeability of Hydrogen Sulfide over natural gas were determined and the impact of pressure and temperature on the permeability and selectivity of fabricated membranes were explored."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The commercial Polysulfone (PS) was purchased from BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). The solvents, including DMF, DMAC, N-hexane and methanol, were supplied from Merck Company in Germany. Distillate water was used throughout this study. The characteristics of natural gas are presented in Table 1 ."
3,Equipment,"2.2 Equipment The experimental set-up was prepared according to required research and investigating the effect of pressure and temperature on membrane performance. Also, the gas permeate flux was determined by the set-up, which has a plate module that drives the stream on the membrane [20]. This design was very general and based on manometers and flow meters position; it could calculate the permeability factor by different methods. The manometers could measure the pressure up to 80 barg with 2% accuracy and 10 barg with 0.2% accuracy in feed and permeate stream, respectively. The PT-100 thermometer was fabricated in Iran and could measure and adjust the temperature up to 150°C. A filter was placed in the flow path to prevent the entry of fine particles into the module. The flat sheet module was fabricated from stainless steel SS-A316. The furnace was used for high pressure, which was worked by a PLC system. This setup could connect with a gas chromatography system. The advantages of this set-up in comparison with previous studies [21] are as follows: Working at high pressure, heating the process gas directly by passing it through a furnace, Fabrication of pilot thermal furnace, Explaining the required equations for calculating the gas permeability based on different manometers, flow meters and connecting to the gas chromatography system, the ability to change the temperature and pressure simultaneously and studying their effect on membrane performance."
4,The mechanical condition of experimental setup,"2.3 The mechanical condition of experimental setup This equipment is designed and built based on the ASME standard. According to the standard, all devices should be Hydro tested with a pressure of 1.5 times higher than the working pressure (80 barg). The different parts of the setup are specified invv Fig. 1 . Before any testing, it should be ensured that the measuring devices are calibrated. Each of them is tested by the reference devices that have been approved with valid certificates of laboratories. In addition, the thermometer, pressure gauges and flow meters should be calibrated. A neutral gas (usually nitrogen) was connected to the inlet of the device and then all the valves were opened and the device was dehumidified with very little flow. When the amount of nitrogen in both outputs reaches 100%, it is the end of the O2 removal process. After ensuring that there is no problem in the process, the natural gas was connected to the device and again, all outlet valves were opened for purging nitrogen. The end of this stage is when the gas meter shows the amount of nitrogen at Zero in the outputs of the device."
5,Preparation of Polysulfone membrane,"2.4 Preparation of Polysulfone membrane At first, the polymer should be dried without any moisture in it. Therefore, it was placed in an oven at 80°C for 12 hr, and then this dry matter was placed in the desiccator. About 5 g of solvent (DMAC or DMF) with 2 g of polymer were mixed r to make 7 g of 20% polysulfone solution. Then the solution was inserted on the stirrer to obtain a clear homogeneous solution without any air bubbles (Fig. 2 A). Usually, this stirring will takes between 12 and 48 hr. After the solution was prepared, it was cast in a precise thickness by a filming machine on a flat glass (Fig. 2B). It should be noted that for this operation, the filming machine was made of stainless steel with a precision of 0.01 mm. Any moisture should be absent during the filming on the devices. The operation is done so that after adjusting the thickness required on the glass by the filming machine, the polymer solution is poured into the film nozzle and the casting operation is performed. The phase inversion technique was used to prepare the PS microfiltration membrane. After casting, the solution was immersed in a water bath and put in this state between 12 and 24 hr. The purpose is to remove the solvent from the solution and the membrane configuration. Then, the membrane was immersed again in a methanol solution for 12 hr to remove water and any impurities from the polymeric membrane structure (Fig. 3 A). To remove the residual solvent and methanol (any impurities from the polymeric membrane structure), the membrane was placed in an oven at 80°C for 12 hr (Fig. 3B). After preparation of membrane and before separation, it is better to use a flashlight to ensure no debris, especially bubbles. The two membrane samples were showed in Figs. 4 A and B. Other concentrations of PS polymer with different types of solvents were synthesized by a similar procedure."
6,Characterization tests,"2.5 Characterization tests As mentioned, the membranes were prepared and studied at different temperatures and pressures, which is presented in Table 2 . The prepared membranes were examined twice by natural gas and Hydrogen Sulfide at the pressure of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 barg and temperatures at 25, 35 and 45°C. The solution-diffusion method is usual for gas separation mechanism by polymeric membranes. When the pressure on permeate side is low, the following equation (Eq.1) can be written [21]: p = 273.15 × 10 10 × V L 760 A T ( p 0 × 76 14.7 ) [ d p d t ] (1) where P is the permeability of gas in Barrer, A is the effective area of the membrane (cm2), V is the volume of the down-stream chamber (cm3), L is the membrane thickness (cm), T is the temperature (K), dp/dt is the slope of permeate gas pressure variation against time at the downstream chamber (mmHg/s) and Po (psia) is the feed pressure. The permeability values of each gas were obtained by multiplying the solubility and gas penetration in the polymer membrane. The membrane selectivity is also calculated by dividing the permeation of gases according to the below equations (Eqs.2-3) [20]. (2) P = S × D (3) α A / B = P A P B = ( S A S B ) × ( D A D B ) Where PA and PB are the permeability factor of gas A and B, and S and D, are solubility and gas penetration in the polymer membrane, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Membranes morphology,"3.1 Membranes morphology The Morphologies of the PS membranes were described by SEM(VEGA3 TESCAN, Czech Republic) and the accelerating voltage was fixed at 20 kV. For cross section test, the samples were split under liquid nitrogen, then were sputter covered with gold. The sponge structure of the membrane prepared by DMAC solvent is presented in Fig. 5. A that shows the figure-liked structure, which is due to the delay in phase inversion. As it can be realized from Figs. 5 B and C, by an increase in the concentration of polymer, the density of layers was increased. Considering that the porosity of base composite membranes can improve the mechanical strength. As shown through SEM images, the membranes made by DMAC solvent have better order and correlation, which can increase the influential separation factor. The membranes obtained from DMAC solvent are tidier than the membranes made by DMF. It can be seen from Figs. 5B-E, that as from the bottom of membrane goes upwards, the density was increased on the contrary, the water penetration and the number of cavities is roughly minimized. The membranes prepared by DMF solvent are thicker and more porous than DMAC solvent (Figs., 5 B, C, D, E). As can be seen through SEM images (Figs. 5 A-E), these differences in morphology can have an important influence on the separation of H2S from N.G. Subsequently, these remarks gained by SEM are in promise with the theory of difference morphology formation by solvent, which is due to the difference in chemical and physical features of each solvent [22]."
9,Influence of solvent type on membrane behavior,"3.2 Influence of solvent type on membrane behavior The viscosity of solution was changed with PS concentration, nature and type of solvent. Thus, the proper selection of solvent has a vital role in the ultimate structure of the membrane [23]. The solvent can influence on structural properties and performance of the prepared membrane. As the solvent and water phase inversion was faster, the nucleation was free of polymer and the membrane was more porous. The tendency of solvent to insolvent is based on the similarity of their molecular structures. The polar interaction between water and alcohol for DMF is higher than DMAC, since DMF is more soluble in water and alcohol; therefore phase inversion for DMF is faster than DMAC. Consequently, other researchers [24] confirmed that solvents made various interactions with the chains of polymer based on different physical and chemical properties. Their results showed that the DMF was better than other solvents because of the low solubility parameter difference between 6FDA/PMDA–TMMDA and DMF. Therefore, it delivered superior surrounds for reordering molecular chains to get a thermodynamically preferred lower entropy structure."
10,Effect of feed pressure,"3.3 Effect of feed pressure Since the solubility of DMF and DMAC in water is too close, it was expected that their behavior would be similar. The permeability and selectivity of the M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 (introduced in Table 2) at 25°C are presented in Figs. 6 & 8. The permeability and selectivity for Hydrogen Sulfide in the prepared membrane by DMAC solvent (M3) was higher. It was clear that with increasing pressure, the permeability of Hydrogen Sulfide and natural gas was raised, but the selectivity of Hydrogen Sulfide over natural gas was decreased. By increase in pressure from 2.5 to 5 barg, the selectivity of membranes was raised, but up to 5 barg to 20 barg, the selectivity was gradually decreased. The maximum selectivity of H2S to N.G ratio was 1.29, 1.2, 1.56, 1.38, 1.45 and 1.5 for M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 membranes, respectively. The permeation of H2S was increased with pressure and at 5 Barg it was 102000, 96000, 119000, 85000, 95000 and 99000 barrer for for M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6, respectively. Given that approximately 87 % of the natural gas used in this study is methane and the effects of methane can be studied on this behavior. Methane is a high compressible gas and its compressibility and solubility were enhanced with an increase in pressure and subsequently, the concentration of Methane in porosity was increased. In other words, the adsorption of methane on the membrane surface and its penetration were increased with an increase in the concentration of methane in the porous membrane sites, according to the Ficks law. Also, the absorption of this gas in the membrane was improved with an increase in pressure. By increasing pressure, a higher concentration of Hydrogen Sulfide can be placed on the membrane surface. The solubility of H2S in the membrane was increased since this polar gas has an interaction with the polar part of the membrane. In the polymeric network, the space between the chains was increased with an increase in Hydrogen Sulfide pressure, which increases the mobility gap of some parts of the polymer chain and permeability and subsequently leads to plasticization in the membrane. The membrane plasticization phenomenon has been damaged the membrane structure and its quality [25–26]. As a result of increasing pressure, the permeability of Hydrogen Sulfide and natural gas was increased. Still, due to the degradation of the membrane, the selectivity of Hydrogen Sulfide over natural gas was reduced. As it can be seen in Fig. 5A, also the finger-liked structure of the membrane made from DMAC can increase the permeability of Hydrogen Sulfide, which also is approved through Fig. 6. The selectivity and permeability values of H2S/CH4 versus pressure are presented in Figs. 6&7 . The selectivity of the M3 membrane was reduced from 56.0 to 6.0%, with increase in pressure from 5 to 20 barg. With an increase in pressure, the concentration of Hydrogen Sulfide on the membrane surface was increased and the polar structures of the molecules have interacted with the membrane polar sites and the solubility was increased. But, the selectivity of Hydrogen Sulfide over natural gas was decreased due to membrane degradation. It should be noted that the selectivity and permeability of the PS membrane for separating Hydrogen Sulfide from natural gas are more appropriate than previous studies [21]. The membrane performance at different temperatures and pressure was in consistent with the results of Reijerkerk et al. [27]. For the separation of H2S from CH4, other researchers such as Pourafshari et al., [28], investigated the separation of H2S/CH4 mixtures at different concentrations of H2S by polyphenylene oxide and Cardo-type polyimide at various operational temperatures and pressures. For the Cardotype polyimide membranes, the permeance of CH4 dropped, but it was remained comparatively fixed for the PPO membranes."
11,Effect of PS concentration,"3.4 Effect of PS concentration Fig. 6 presents the permeability's of M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 membranes, which showed that at first the permeability was increased slightly with increase in PS concentration from 15 to 20%, but it was decreased sharply from 119000 to 95000 barrer with an increase in the concentration of PS from 20 to 25% at 5 Barg. The selectivity of M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 membrane for Hydrogen Sulfide versus natural gas is presented in Fig. 7 and it is clear that by increasing the concentration of the polymer, the selectivity of Hydrogen Sulfide versus natural gas was increased to some extent, but the membrane permeability was decreased. In addition, the permeation of H2S at 20 barg, was decreased from 490000 to 445000 barrer, with an increase in PS concentration from 20 to 25%, at M3 and M5 membranes, respectively. The selectivity was increased with increase in the concentration of PS. The M3 had the highest selectivity, which is due to a higher concentration of PS and consequently denser membrane. By increasing the concentration of polymer, the selectivity of Hydrogen Sulfide compared to natural gas has increased. As it can be seen from Fig. 7, the Hydrogen Sulfide over N.G selectivity ratio at 10 barg was increased from 1.1 to 1.32 for M1 and M6 membranes, respectively. For M1 membrane, the Hydrogen Sulfide to N.G selectivity was increased at first from 1.19 to 1.29 with enhance pressure from 2.5 to 5 Barg, and then it was reduced to 1.02 with increase in pressure from 5 to 20 barg. As a result, according to the diagrams of the above section, membranes with a concentration of 20% of the polymer can be used as a suitable membrane. The selectivity was decreased with an increase in high pressures [29]. The influences of polymer concentration on the features of polymers and the morphology of the resulting membranes were investigated by other researchers [30]. They realized that a polymer solution with low viscosity caused open cellular microstructure with giant cells. Still, a high concentration of polymer made the construction of a fine cellular microstructure because of founding chain embarrassment, which enhances the viscosity of solution."
12,Effect of temperature,"3.5 Effect of temperature The selectivity of M3 at different pressure and temperature was presented in Table 3 , which indicates that, the selectivity of Hydrogen Sulfide over natural gas was reduced with an increase in temperature. For M3 membrane, the selectivity of Hydrogen Sulfide to natural gas at different temperature at 5 barg is presented in Fig. 8. The results showed that the selectivity decreased with an increase in temperature. The feed temperature is one of the main parameters in the selectivity of polymeric membranes. At a certain pressure, gas diffusion in polymeric membranes was increased with an increase in temperature. The membrane selectivity was reduced with an increase in temperature, so the permeability coefficient of Hydrogen Sulfide was decreased and the permeation of natural gas was enhanced. In general, at a given pressure, the gas penetration was increased with temperature. The diffusion relation versus temperature is expressed by an equation similar to the Arrhenius equation (Eq.4) as the following: (4) P A = P A 0 exp ( − E p R T ) PA, Ep and PA0 are permeability (Barrer), activation energy and initial permeability, respectively. The two significant factors that affect the Ep of gases are the molecular size of penetrant and the interaction between gases and polymer matrix [31]. The gases with higher Ep have lower permeated and vice versa. The Ep is defined according to the following equation (Eq. 5): (5) E P = E d + Δ H S Where ∆HS is the heat of sorption and Ed is the needed energy for diffusion. According to other researchers [32], H2S has a high negative heat of sorption, which results in the considerable reduction of solubility at higher temperatures. In opposition, the solubility of CH4 with low heat of sorption was reduced a little with increasing temperature. The more flexibility of chains and segmental mobility was enhanced with an increase in temperature and this phenomenon is positive for the required energy of diffusion. The rise in temperature has two different effects on solubility reduction and permeation enhancement of Hydrogen Sulfide. The increase in diffusion was significant and can overcome the reduction in solubility, so the permeance of H2S was increased somewhat. But, according to the larger kinetic diameter and superior positive Ed values for CH4, the increase in temperature results in the permeance enhancement. Thus, the H2S/CH4 selectivity was decreased with increase in temperature because methane is more permeate than Hydrogen Sulfide. As it was clear from Table 3 and Fig. 8, the selectivity of H2S/CH4 was reduced from 56% to 44% for M3 membrane, with increase in temperature from 25 to 45°C. These findings are in agreement with the results of Dorosti et al. [33]. Based on the previous studies [34], the calculated EP values for H2S gas are smaller than the corresponding values for methane. The permeation data also confirms EP calculations. The main reason for this behavior is that the permeation rate of methane is higher than Hydrogen Sulfide. Due to the low permeability of methane than Hydrogen Sulfide, the activation energy of methane was higher than Hydrogen Sulfide [35–37]."
13,Conclusions,"The results of this research can be summarized as follows: The removal of H2S from natural gas is necessary due to the production of acid gases, corrosion and so on. An experimental setup was established and the effect of solvents, PS concentration, pressure and temperature were investigated on the separation of Hydrogen Sulfide from natural gas. It was found that the membranes made with DMAC solvent have a higher order than the membranes made with DMAF. And the amount of holes in polymer structures is almost as low as possible with an increase in polymer concentrations. The selectivity of Hydrogen Sulfide to natural gas was reduced with increase in temperature and the best temperature was obtained at 25°C, because the separation time was increased in excessive temperature reductions. It could be concluded that by increasing pressure, the permeability of Hydrogen Sulfide and natural gas was increased, while selectivity was decreased. In M3 membranes (20% of PS, DMAC solvent), which was the best membrane, the permeate amounts were increased from 11800 to 490000 Barrer with an increase in pressure from 2.5 to 20 Barg, but the selectivity ratio of H2S to N.G was increased with increase in pressure from 2.5 to 5 Barg at first and then reduced with enhance in pressure to 20 Barg. The maximum selectivity ratio of H2S to N.G was 1.56 for M3 membranes at 25°C and 5 barg, at this condition, the permeate amount of H2S was 119000 Barrer. It is recommended to consider the following to improve and complete this project. 1- Use different nanoparticles suitable for membrane composition. 2- Operating conditions can be considered at higher pressures and different temperatures. 3- Making Matrici membranes with other nanoparticles, such as nano-carbon and then coating them. The permeated amounts in this project were higher than the previous researches. Maybe it was originated from high operational pressure, which should be investigated in future works."
