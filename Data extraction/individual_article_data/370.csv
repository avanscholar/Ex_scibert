0,Introduction,"The rapid development of industry as well as the transportation, all powered directly or indirectly by fossil fuels, has resulted in the unprecedented level of CO2 emissions. In current, there has been a growing concern on the global warming, which is principally caused by CO2. Thus, great effort has been devoted to either capture CO2 or converts CO2 into a value-added product as a way to reduce these emissions. Compared with physical treatment of CO2, the utilization CO2 to value-added chemicals such as methanol, higher alcohol, hydrocarbons not only reduce the amount of greenhouse gas but also minimize the use of fossil resources [1–5]. Compared with methanol, higher alcohols are much more important, which have been applied in fuel and fuel additives [6]. However, the synthesis of higher alcohol from CO2 had more challenge than the synthesis of methanol, as the former required the integration of catalytic site for CO2 reduction and carbon–carbon bond formation [7]. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been studied for the higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) from CO2 hydrogenation, mainly including Co [8], Ru [9], Fe [10], Cu [11] and so on. Homogeneous catalysts, especially noble metal ruthenium catalysts usually showed higher catalytic activity than the heterogeneous catalysts, as homogenous catalysts are more flexible to contact with the substrates (CO2 and H2). For instance, Han et al. [9] reported that a homogeneous catalytic system [Ru3(CO)12/Rh2(CO)4Cl2–LiI] for the synthesis of high alcohols in 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) at 200°C and 8MPa (H2/CO2 =2). The selectivity for the higher alcohols could be as high as 96.4% under the optimal conditions. However, it is tedious to recycle the homogeneous catalysts and purify the alcohols from the organic solvent. Synthesis of high alcohols with heterogeneous catalysts was generally performed at elevated reaction temperatures. The high reaction temperature resulted in the reverse water gas-shift (RWGS) reaction to produce CO, as this step is endothermic. For example, Guo et al. [11] studied the K/Cu–Zn Catalyst, a CO2 conversion of 32.4% was obtained at 350°C, 6MPa and H2/CO2 =3. However, this method only produced the total alcohol with a low selectivity of 11.8%, and the main byproduct was CO with a selectivity of 45.3%. Therefore, the design of new heterogeneous catalytic routes for HAS reaction via CO2 hydrogenation under mild reaction conditions is highly desirable. Cobalt catalysts have been used in industry to convert syngas into hydrocarbon and alcohol via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS), however, due to the strong hydrogenation ability and lack of RWGS activity, the production of CO2 hydrogenation was mainly methane [12]. Khan et al. recently [13] found that adding Pt to Co and formed Pt3Co octapods, enabled the accumulation of negative charges on the Pt atoms, and promoted the activation of CO2 to methanol. Beside the active site of metal species, the morphology of the supports also shows a great effect on the catalyst activity and products selectivity. For example, Tsang and co-workers [14] discovered that the platelike ZnO supported Cu catalyst produced a higher selectivity towards methanol from CO2 hydrogenation than rodlike ZnO supported Cu catalyst. This was due to the fact that the exposed polar (002) face in platelike ZnO showed a much stronger material synergy with copper than other crystal facets. In this study, two kinds of Pt/Co3O4 catalysts were prepared, and used for the synthesis of higher alcohols in a continuous reactor without any solvent. Compared with the work by Han and co-workers in a batch reactor with organic solvents [15], our method is much more competitive in the practical synthesis of higher alcohols, which did not require the use of organic-water mixed solvents, and the separation of higher alcohols. More importantly, our methods can be continuously used for the HAS reaction. Particularly, the attention has been paid on the morphology of Co3O4 on the catalyst activity and products selectivity over the Pt catalysts for the CO2 hydrogenation. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no such reports on the study of the support morphology in HAS reaction from CO2 hydrogenation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Co3O4 nanorods were prepared according to the known method with some slight modifications [16]. Briefly, Co(OAc)2·4H2O (4.98g, 20mmol) was firstly dissolved in 60mL of ethylene glycol at 160°C. To this solution, 200mL of aqueous Na2CO3 (0.2M) solution was added slowly and the mixture was further stirred for 1h under vigorous stirring. Then the reactor was cooled down to room temperature, and the solid was got by filtration and washed with water. The as-made solid was dried at 50°C overnight in a vacuum oven and further calcined at 450°C in the air for 4h. The as-made Co3O4 with nanorods structure was abbreviated as Co3O4-r. The Co3O4 nanoplates were prepared by the hydrothermal method [17]. Co(NO3)2.6H2O (5.82g, 24mmol) was firstly dissolved in 40mL of H2O, and then a mixture of oleylamine (40mL) and ethanol (200mL) was added into the solution under a magnetic stirring for 30min. The obtained solution was transferred into 500mL autoclave with a Teflon liner, and kept at 180°C for 12h. After cooling to room temperature, the as-made solid was recovered via centrifugation, washed with water, and dried. Then, the obtained β-Co(OH)2 was calcined in the air at 350°C for 3h. The Co3O4 nanoplates were abbreviated as Co3O4-p. Pt/Co3O4 catalysts were prepared via the impregnation method. Co3O4 was impregnated with diammine platinum (II) nitrite, and calcined in air at 300°C for 2h. The weight percentage of platinum was 1% in theory."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were obtained with a FEI Tecnai G20 instrument. The samples were prepared by directly suspending the catalyst in ethanol with ultrasonic treatment. A copper microscope grid covered with perforated carbon was dipped into the solution and then dried. The morphologies and particle sizes of the samples were observed by an SU8000 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 15kV. BET surface area of the prepared materials was determined by physisorption of N2 at 77K by using a quantachrome Autosorb-1-C-MS instrument. About 200mg sample were degassed in vacuum at 623K for 3h prior to the measurements to remove pre-adsorbed components. The specific surface area was determined from the linear portion of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) plot. The total pore volumes and the average pore sizes were calculated from the desorption branch of the adsorption isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) formula. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared samples were measured in the range 10–80° on a Bruker-D8 diffractormeter with monochromatized Cu-Kαradiation (λ=1.54056Å) operated at 40kV and 40mA and collected by a Vantec-1 detector. H2-temperature program reduction (H2-TPR) was experiments were carried out using AMI-200 from Zeton Altamira Company. The sample (100mg) in a quartz reactor was purged with 30mL/min Ar while heating at a ramp rate of 10/min to 150°C and maintaining that temperature for 1h to remove traces of water. After cooling to 50°C, the sample was reduced in a flow of 10 vol.% H2/Ar (30mL/min) while heating from 50°C to 800°C at a rate of 10°C/min. H2 impulse experiments was done for quantitative calibration of the consumed H2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo VG scientific ESCA MultiLab-2000 spectrometer with a monochromatized Al Ka source (1486.6eV) at a constant analyzer pass energy of 25eV. The binding energy was estimated to be accurate within 0.2eV. Pt 4f, O1s Co2p and C1s spectra were acquired and the latter was set at 284.6eV and taken as a reference for binding energy (BE) calibration. The software XPS PEAK was used to fit the XPS spectra using a mixture of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions in a 40/60 ratio and a Shirley background."
4,Typical procedure for CO2 hydrogenation,"2.3 Typical procedure for CO2 hydrogenation All catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed stainless steel mini-reactor (length of 53cm and inside diameter of 8mm) at a total pressure at 2MPa. The reactor system was equipped with a programmable temperature controller. Typically, the Pt/Co3O4 catalyst (0.2g) mixed with 0.2g SiC was firstly reduced at 200°C (2°C/min of heating rate) or 250°C for 2h with H2 flow rate of 20mL/min at atmosphere pressure. The reactor was then cooled down to room temperature and the mixture gas (22.5% CO2, 67.5% H2 and 10% N2) was introduced to increase the system pressure slowly to 2MPa. The Pt/Co3O4 catalysts was kept for a certain time at different temperatures (190–230°C) and GHSV=6Lh−1 gcat −1. The gas products were analyzed on line by Agilent GC 7890B gas chromatography (thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors). The liquid product was collected in cold trap and analyzed by 4890 gas chromatography (flame ionization detectors) off line. The reaction parameters of CO2 conversion, selectivity and time space yield (STY) are defined as: X C O 2 = n C O 2 , i n − n C O 2 , o u t n C O 2 , i n , s e l e c t i v i t y = n p r o d u c t , o u t × c a r b o n n u m b e r n C O 2 , i n − n C O 2 , o u t S T Y R O H = F C O 2 , i n × X C O 2 × 60 × S R O H 22.4 × m c a t ( m m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 ) , S T Y C 2 + O H = F C O 2 , i n × X C O 2 × 60 × S C 2 + O H 22.4 × m c a t ( m m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 ) . The CO2 conversion and gas products selectivity was collected a stable data after 50h reaction. The liquid products selectivity was the average value of 50h reaction. The mass balance of gas and liquid production to feedstock was larger than 90%."
5,Results,"The morphologies of the Co3O4 nanorods and nanoplates were characterized by TEM and SEM technologies. As show in Fig. 1 a and c, the lengths of nanorods Co3O4 was centered at 50–150nm and the diameter was in a range of 5–10nm. The Co3O4 nanoplates showed uniform hexagons structure, and the thickness and edge length were calculated to be about 20–30nm and 250–350nm (Fig. 1b and d). The crystal structures of the supports and the catalysts were characterized by XRD patterns in Fig. 2 . Only the face centered cubic (FCC) phase of Co3O4 structure was identified (JCPDS 42-1467). The dominant exposed planes of Co3O4 nanoplates are {112}, which are the planes normal to both the set of (220) planes and (222) planes. The dominant exposed planes of Co3O4 nanorods are {011}, which are the planes normal to both the set of (311) and (222) planes [17]. The ratio of the peak intensity of the (220) plane to (311) plane was calculated to be 0.38 and 0.21 for Co3O4-p and Co3O4-r. This was consistent with Hu’s results [17]. In additions, there were no Pt diffraction peaks observed in the XRD patterns of Pt/Co3O4 catalysts, which should be due to the low loading of Pt and the high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 2). Fig. S1 displays the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of Co3O4. The physical properties were summarized in Table S1. The surface area of Co3O4-r and Co3O4-p was 127.4 and 41.9m2/g respectively. The H2-TPR profiles of Co3O4 and Pt/Co3O4 are shown in Fig. 3 . The Co3O4-r support showed two reduction peaks at the temperatures of 540 and 306°C, which were ascribed to the reduction from Co3O4 to CoO, and the subsequent reduction of CoO to metallic Co [18]. However, the reduction peak from Co3O4 to CoO for Co3O4-p shifted to much lower temperature (363°C). The H2-TPR results indicate that the support morphology greatly affected its redox behavior and Co3O4 with naoplates morphology could be much more easily reduced than Co3O4 with nanorods structure. For the Pt/Co3O4 catalysts, it was observed that all the corresponding reduction peaks greatly shifted to much lower temperatures, and each sample showed a sharp peak at lower temperature (≤200°C) together with a broad peak at higher temperature (Fig. 3b). The decrease of the reduction temperature of Co3O4 by the addition of Pt was presumably due to the spillover of H2 from Pt to Co3O4 [19]. As our reaction was also performed in the presence of H2, it was believed that the addition of Pt improved the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, even Co for the Pt/Co3O4 catalysts. XPS was used to study the valence states of the elements for the Pt/Co3O4-r catalysts (Fig. 4 ). For Pt/Co3O4-r, two peaks with the binding energies at 780.2 and 795.3eV were assigned to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co3O4-r. The difference in the binding energies at 14.9eV between Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 was consistent with the data reported by Wang and co-workers [20]. Similar two XPS peaks were observed for the Pt-Co3O4-p catalyst, but the two peaks for Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 shifted to a lower binding energies at 778.0 and 794.9eV. These results suggested that Pt nanoparticles showed a slight stronger interaction with Co3O4-p, which was in accordance with the H2-TPR results as discussed above. Furthermore, the Co 2p3/2 peaks for the catalysts were fitted and they can be deconvoluted into two peaks with the binding energies at 780.8 and 779.4eV (Fig. 5 b), which are attributed to Co2+ and Co3+, respectively [21]. The peak ratios of Co3+/Co2+ were calculated to be 0.8 and 0.7 for Pt/Co3O4-r and Pt/Co3O4-p, repetitively. Thus, the average valence states of Co was calculated to be to 2.55 and 2.41 for the Pt/Co3O4-r and Pt/Co3O4-p catalysts, which were both lower than the normal valence state of 2.67 in Co3O4. Fig. 5c shows the O 1s XPS spectra of the catalysts. The peak with a binding energy at 529.8eV is assigned to the lattice oxygen (Ol), whereas, the peak at 531.4 is associated with the oxygen atoms around oxygen vacancies on the surface (Os) [22]. The peak ratio of Os/Ol was calculated to be 0.32 and 0.30 for the Pt/Co3O4-p and Pt/Co3O4-r catalysts. The higher Os/Ol molar ratio in the catalyst surface corresponds to higher redox properties for as-prepared Co3O4 [23]. That was consistent with the H2-TPR results, which showed that Co3O4-p was much more easily reduced than Co3O4-r. Unfortunately, the signal of Pt spectra was too weak to detect (not shown here)."
6,Synthesis of higher alcohols over the Pt/Co3O4 catalyst,"3.1 Synthesis of higher alcohols over the Pt/Co3O4 catalyst The catalytic performance of the as-prepared Pt/Co3O4 catalysts was evaluated by HAS reaction from CO2 hydrogenation. Before collect the data, the Pt/Co3O4 catalysts were firstly reduced at 250°C for 2h with H2 at atmosphere pressure. After cooling to room temperature, the feed gas (22.5% CO2, 67.5% H2 and 10% N2) was then introduced to increase the pressure slowly to 2MPa. As shown in Fig. S2, both the Pt/Co3O4-r and Pt/Co3O4-p catalysts showed stable CO2 conversions during the tested reaction period of 50h. At the same reaction temperature, the Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst showed a higher catalytic activity than the Pt/Co3O4-r. For example, the Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst produced a higher CO2 conversion (49.9% at the beginning and a stable data of 44.5% for 50h at 230°C), while the Pt/Co3O4-r catalyst gave a stable CO2 conversion of 37.8% at 230°C. The possible reason should be due to the fact that the Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst showed higher redox ability as we have discussed above, which accelerated the CO2 hydrogenation. It was also noted that the catalyst activity of the Pt/Co3O4 catalysts increased with the increase of the reaction temperature. For instance, the stable conversion of CO2 over the Pt/Co3O4-p increased from 32.6% at 210°C to 44.5% at 230°C, and it increased from 26.5% to 37.8% for the Pt/Co3O4-r catalyst. Table S2 summarizes the products distributions of the tested experiments at different conditions. As shown in Table S2, the products selectivity was greatly affected by the type of the catalysts, while the reaction temperature showed almost showed no influence on the products distribution. Although the Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst gave much higher CO2 conversion, the methane selectivity was higher than 90% both at 210 and 230°C. The selectivity of alcohols (ROH) was less than 2% over the Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst. The methane selectivity over the Pt/Co3O4-r catalyst greatly decreased to around 68%, and the lower hydrocarbons (C2+HC) selectivity increased obviously (27.4% at 210°C and 28.7% at 230°C). However, the selectivity of ROH was still low (less than 4%). To confirm the activity site of catalysts, the catalysts were reduced at H2 atmosphere at 250°C for 2h, and were detected by XRD. As shown in Fig. S3, no diffraction peak belong to Co3O4 was detected after reduction at 250°C. The support in Pt/Co3O4-r was totally reduced to CoO, and the support in Pt/Co3O4-p was totally reduced to metallic Co, which included face centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) two crystal. No Co-Pt co-metal or Pt was detected. Agree with Gnanamani and co-workers’ results, the production of CO2 hydrogenation for metallic Co catalysts was mainly methane due to the strong hydrogenation ability and lack of RWGS activity [12]. With the aim to increase the selectivity of the alcohols, the reduction temperature of the catalysts was reduced to 200°C to inhibit the total formation of metallic Co. Before evaluating the activity of catalysts, the catalysts were detected by XRD after reduction at H2 atmosphere at 200 for 2h to confirm the activity site. The results in Fig. 5 showed on one hand, Co3O4 and CoO were co-existed in the Pt/Co3O4-r catalysts after reduction at 200°C. On the other hand, part of Co3O4 in Pt/Co3O4-p was reduced to CoO and metallic Co even at 200°C. The XRD result was consistent with the H2-TPR experiment. The morphology of Co3O4 affected the reduction ability of catalyst. The reduction of Pt/Co3O4-p was much easier than Pt/Co3O4-r, and formed some metallic Co even at 200°C. Fig. 6 shows the CO2 conversions over the Pt/Co3O4 catalysts after reduction at 200°C. The CO2 conversion over the Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst was lower than that with the Pt/Co3O4-r catalyst for the two tested reaction temperatures. However, the selectivity of alcohols all increased at the reaction temperatures of 190 and 200°C (Table 1 ). The highest alcohol selectivity was 26.7% for the Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst at 190°C (Table 1, Entry 3). The highest STY of higher alcohol (0.56mmolgcat −1 h−1) was got for Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst at 200°C. The alcohol distribution of Pt/Co3O4 catalysts after reduction at 200°C was shown in Fig. 7 . Methanol was present of the largest proportion (78–93%), and ethanol was followed, the fraction of propanol and butanol was very low. The higher alcohol (R2+OH) selectivity decreased with the reaction temperature decreasing for both two catalysts."
7,Discussion,"In present work, two Pt/Co3O4 catalysts gave difference performance after reduced at 200°C. The CO2 conversion of Pt/Co3O4-r was higher than that of Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst, but the ROH selectivity of Pt/Co3O4-r was lower. The main production of Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst was methane, alcohol, and only about 3% light hydrocarbon was detected. However, 20–25% light hydrocarbon was detected for the production of Pt/Co3O4-r catalyst. The different CO2 hydrogenation activity and selectivity was due to different essence of two catalysts. On one hand, according to the XRD results, part Co3O4 of Pt/Co3O4-r catalyst was reduced to CoO after reduction at 200°C, the catalyst can be denoted as Pt/Co3O4-x. As the Co3O4 had larger mobility of surface oxygen than other oxide, such as CeO2, TiO2, the surface oxygen was easily reduced and formed oxygen vacancies [20]. Kennedy et al. [24] found the Pt surface is fully reduced to its metallic state and the Co3O4 surface has been partially reduced, likely to Co(II) even at 120°C H2 atmosphere due to the H2 spillover effect. On the other hand, part Co3O4 of Pt/Co3O4-p catalyst was reduced to CoO and metallic Co after reduction at 200°C, the catalyst can be denoted as Pt-Co/Co3O4-x. The metallic Co had strong hydrogenation ability, produced methane dominantly and inhabited chain propagation [12]. This was confirmed by the experiments after reduction at 250°C for Pt/Co3O4-p catalysts. The methane selectivity was higher than 90% with the metallic Co content increasing. Under the 200°C reduction temperature, on one hand, the CO2 conversion increased but selectivity of ROH decreased with increasing the temperature from 190 to 200°C, this was due to the HAS reaction was exothermic process, low temperature was thermodynamic favorable for this reaction. On the other hand, the selectivity of C2+OH increased with increasing the temperature from 190 to 200°C. This was ascribed to synthesis of higher alcohol was more thermodynamically favorable than that of methanol. That was different from the F-T synthesis, which short-chain alkanes was more thermodynamically favorable [7]."
8,Conclusion,"The morphology effect of Co3O4 was studied for higher alcohol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. Both two Pt/Co3O4 catalysts gave stable CO2 conversion and relative higher alcohol selectivity during 50h under mild reaction condition. The Pt/Co3O4-p was much easier reduced, part Co3O4 was reduced to CoO and metallic Co in the reaction condition, formed new activate site (Pt-Co/Co3O4-x). The synergic effect of Pt, Co nanoparticles and oxygen vacancies of Co3O4-x improved the adsorption of H2 and CO2, and achieved the highest R2+OH yield of 0.56mmolgcat −1 h−1at 200°C and 2MPa."
