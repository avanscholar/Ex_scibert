0,Introduction,"In recent years there have been plenty investigations into the production of renewable energy sources. This has become a major concern as a result of increased awareness of the negative effects the continuous use of petroleum derived fuels and chemicals have on the environment [1]. With increased awareness by individuals and governments agencies around the world the technology used for producing renewable energy has been increasingly simplified. The simplification of the technology has shifted the focus to the variation of products that can be obtained from these sources. There are several sources of renewable energy; these may include solar, geothermal, hydro, wind and biomass. Out of all the sources mentioned biomass is the only source material that can be used to create solid, liquid or gas products [2]. Biomass can be converted to valued products through two pathways which are biological or thermochemical [3,4]. Biological pathway primarily involves the use of microorganisms that contains enzymes which convert the biomass into valued products [5]. The biological pathway is very delicate and highly restricted because these biological entities can only survive under specific conditions [6]. On the other hand, there is the thermo-chemical conversion; thermo-chemical conversion is comprised of several processes. Some of these process are combustion, torrefaction, gasification, and, pyrolysis. The difference between these processes is the relationship the biomass transformation has with the available oxygen. In the list from combustion to pyrolysis there is a gradual decrease in the amount of available oxygen during transformation [7]. However thermo-chemical conversion differs from biological conversion because it uses heat and pressure to break down complex bio-molecules into smaller fragments that are easier to manage and have more value [8]. Biomass pyrolysis refers to the thermal degradation process of organic compounds in the absence of oxygen to obtain bio-oil, syngas, and biochar, the converion of biomass to high value added fuels and chemicals via pyrolysis has received increasing attention in the past two decades [9–11]. Even though biomass is one of the most available sources for renewable energy, the specific material which should be used is a factor that should be considered. Out of all the possible sources of biomass the most abundant is lignocellulosic biomass. Lignocellulosic biomass is composed of primarily three major compounds that are cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose [12]. Cellulose is generally the largest fraction, representing approximately 40 wt.% to 50 wt.% of the biomass, lignin is the second largest fraction that is approximately 16 wt.% to 33 wt.% depending on the feedstock source, and the hemicellulose portion occupies a majority of the remaining mass. Out of the three major components, lignin is the least understood and least used because of its molecular structure. There are many industrial sources of lignin that can be used to produce valued compounds; one source that has been considered comes from the paper and pulp industry. Annually about 400 million metric tons of paper is produced which leaves an excess amount of waste lignin that is used as low grade heating material [13]. Considering the high availability of this material there have been several investigations into its use as a fuel source [14,15]. For improved product quality and sustainability the addition of waste plastic material to the biomass during pyrolysis has been considered. This is a suitable material because it is rich with hydrocarbons and if not recycled it is one of the leading cause of environmental pollution. Annually about 100 million metric ton of waste plastic material is discarded [16]. Recently, co-pyrolysis of biomass with polymers for bio-based fuel and chemicals production has drawn considerable attention [17,18] Microwave pyrolysis of biomass involves the process that biomass is converted to bio-oil, syngas and bio-char via microwave-assisted heating, in comparison with conventional pyrolysis, there are many advantages for microwave pyrolysis including energy efficiency due to no size reduction and drying, mild reaction condition, and higher quality of products [19,20]. The parameters of microwave biomass co-pyrolysis with polythelene have been established, there are several investigations that have identified general conditions for the production of valued compounds during microwave co-pyrolysis [21–23]. Most of the research today is focused on improving the bio-oil product while reducing the cost of production. In order to improve the bio-oil composition, zeolite catalyst is one of the primary catalysts that have been used to do so [24,25]. Zeolite catalysts have been used in the fuel and chemical industry for a long time but in today’s reality it is necessary to discover other types of catalysts that are just as good and are sustainable. This has led to the investigation of the use of waste lignin material as a selective barrier. Lignin-based char is a porous material that can select desired compounds in the bio-oil. Bio-based catalyst materials have been the subject of recent investigations, one of the principal directives for the use of these catalyst is to reduce the cost of production for the desired compounds. Oregui [26] investigated magnetically activated carbon derived from various bio-mass sources, in their investigation they explained that the modified catalyst was able to produce high quality bio-oil with valued hydrocarbons, ketones and phenols. In this investigation recycled lignin based char was used, the selectivity of catalyst can be improved by modifying the base structure with transition metal incorporation. This is similar to the results obtained by several investigations where they explained that the transition metal modification of ZSM-5 catalyst was superior to pure ZSM-5 catalyst and gave better results [27,28]. This investigation was performed with the objective of testing the selectivity of recycled char as a catalyst for bio-oil/bio-fuel production. This will eventually lead to a cheaper and more sustainable ways to manufacture high quality bio-oil using renewable catalyst materials."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The lignin used in this investigation was purchased from Tokyo chemical industry Co. LTD., in Japan, the second material which was used is the LDPE which was purchased from China Petro Co. The elemental analysis of these materials are shown in Table 1 . The analysis of the elements inside of the lignin shows that it is primarily made up of carbon and oxygen with small amounts of sulphur and hydrogen. Dry Ash Free biomass was used in the elemental composition analysis and the oxygen content was determined by the difference. The transition metal used for the modification was obtained in the form of a hydrated salt (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) which was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Zinc was chosen as the modification metal because in previous experiments it has been reported to be optimum for compound selectivity [29]."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The excessive wetness impregnation method was used to modify the lignin-based char [30]. Lignin-based char was created using microwave heating, lignin biomass was measured and placed inside the reaction flask; no microwave absorbent was added so that the resulting char would be as pure as possible. The atmosphere inside the reaction flask was purged with N2 gas in order to create an anoxic environment. The microwave was then set at a maximum temperature of 550 °C and a retention time of 30 min. This extensive time was to ensure that complete pyrolysis had occurred and only quality bio-char was left behind. After the bio-char was created it was removed from the reaction flask and allowed to cool down to room temperature. Whenever lignin powder undergoes pyrolysis it tends to form large clumps that stick together. In order to create the modified catalyst these clumps of char were grounded into fine powder and then sieved through a fine mesh to ensure uniformity of the size. The lignin-based char powder was washed repeatedly with de-ionized water to remove any contaminants from its structure and also to open the pores. After washing it was dried in an oven at 105 °C for 15 h to remove any moisture. The zinc metal was integrated into the crystalline structure of the lignin-based char by first dissolving the zinc salt in an excess of de-ionized water. The lignin-based char was then added to the solution; using a magnetic stirrer it was thoroughly mixed for 6 h in a water bath that was maintained at 60 °C. The use of the transition metal was in a 5% ratio to the lignin-based char framework. After mixing in the water bath, the catalyst was separated from the excess de-ionized water using a vacuum filter; and then molded into 3 mm x 3 mm x 5 mm cylindrical shapes and was dried in an electric oven at 105 °C for 15 h at vacuum. After drying the modified catalyst was calcined in a tube furnace at 550 °C for 4 h [31]. Inside the tube furnace an anoxic atmosphere was maintained by purging the system with 99.99% pure nitrogen gas with a flow rate of 60 mL/min."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure The schematic diagram of the microwave pyrolysis apparatus can be seen elsewhere [3,7]. The microwave pyrolysis system consisted of the following components: a 1000W, 2.45 GHz microwave cavity manufactured by Nanjing XianouTechnology Company (Nanjing, China), an infrared temperature sensor for temperature measurement, a 500 mL quartz flask inside the microwave oven into which the biomass feedstock was loaded, a packed bed reactor for the catalyst and a product cooling and collection system where the condensable liquid(bio-oil) was collected. The feedstock was weighed out on an electronic scale and placed inside the reaction flask. All the experimental feedstocks were co-pyrolysis (lignin/LDPE) and were in accordance with the experimental design that was produced by the central composite design software. The infrared sensor was connected to the quarts reactor via a vertical quartz tube that pointed to the center of the biomass feedstock; this infrared sensor is a 24 V DCWAHOME model: IS-900AW sensor with a temperature range of 0–900 °C；and has an output power of 4–20 mA. The catalyst and modified catalyst were used ex-situ, the ratio of the amount of catalyst used was 5 wt.% of the amount of feedstock that would undergo pyrolysis. The catalyst was placed in a packed bed reactor that was also maintained at a temperature of 500 °C. In order to maintain anoxic conditions, nitrogen gas was used to purge the system at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. After purging the system for 15 min to maintain an inert atmosphere, the power supply for the microwave was turned on and the reaction parameters were input into the microwave. The reaction temperature of feedstock was monitored by the infrared sensor through a closed end quartz tube which penetrated to the centre of the reaction flask. After reaching the desired reaction temperature, the microwave reactor equipped with automatic temperature/power control used a minimum power (0–100 W) to maintain the desired reaction temperatures. After the designated processing time was finished the power supply to the microwave was turned off and the valve from the nitrogen tank purging the system was closed. The bio-oil vapors produced during the pyrolysis were immediately cooled after passing over the catalyst bed that was inside the packed bed reactor and entering a series of condensers whose temperature was controlled at 5 °C by thermostat located inside a cooling system. The condensable and non-condensable parts of the vapor were regarded as the volatile fractions of the experiment. During pyrolysis the heavier volatiles were condensed into liquids as bio-oils and the lighter volatiles escaped as syn-gas at the end of the condensers where they were either burned or collected for analysis. Lignin-based char was left in the quartz flask. The weight of syn-gas product was calculated by subtracting the difference of the bio-oil and bio-char from the feedstock mass."
5,Experimental design,"2.4 Experimental design The experiment was separated into two parts; the first part of this experimental design was to investigate the general selectivity of both catalysts using the standard experimental design. The analysis of products of these catalysts would then indicate which would merit further study and optimization of the design using central composite design (CCD) software. A Central composite experimental design (CCD) method was employed to obtain the optimization of the product yield distribution. The LDPE to lignin ratio (X1,) and the reaction temperature (X2 °C), were selected as independent variables. The central values were chosen as follows: 450 °C, 12.50% LDPE ratio with a power input of 750W, the details of the experimental design can be seen in Table 2 . In the design of the experiment the product yield distribution of the bio-oil, bio-char, and syn-gas were chosen as dependent variables. After the desired temperature was obtained the reaction time was recorded. CCD response surface analysis was also used for the optimization of the component composition of the bio-oil where the component groups were chosen as the responses. A 22-factorial CCD, with 4 axial points (α = √2) and 5 replications at the center points leading to a total number of 13 experiments was employed to optimize the reaction conditions."
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.5 Catalyst characterization In order to study the effects of the transition metal modifications on the prepared catalysts, XRD was used to characterize the prepared catalysts. XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 ADVANCEX-ray Diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray source operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. To further characterize the catalysts, NH3-TPD analysis was also conducted using a Quantachrome ChemBET PULSAR. In each of the selected catalyst a 100 mg sample was selected and sieved through a fine mesh, the sample was then accurately re-weighed and placed into a U-shaped quartz reaction tube. The sample was heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 15 °C/min. N2 gas was used in the analysis at a flow rate of 60 mL/min and a detector current of 134 mA was used for ammonia absorption and saturation. BET analysis was also used in the characterization of the catalysts using a Tristar II 3020 analyzer from Micrometrics Instruments Corporation. The sample weight was selected and placed inside of the analyzer. N2 gas was used as the adsorbative and the bathe temperature was maintained at a temperature of −195.85 °C. Analysis of the data obtained from the BET analysis was able to determine the BET surface area of the prepared catalyst as well as the pore volumes."
7,GC/MS analysis of bio-oil,"2.6 GC/MS analysis of bio-oil Prior to GC/MS analysis the raw bio crude oil underwent pre-treatment in order to prepare it for introduction into the machine. The sample was prepared by a 1:2 ratio between the bio-crude oil and 100% methanol as the solvent. The liquid product was bio crude oil collected after pyrolysis and condensates of volatile products. The chemical composition of bio-oils was determined with an Agilent gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC/MS; GC, Agilent 7890A; MS, Agilent 5975C) with a DB-5 capillary column (3 0 m × 0. 25 mm × 0. 25 μm). The GC was programmed to heat to 40 °C for 5 min followed by heating to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. The divergence ratio is 50:1, and the sample quantity is 0.2 μL. The flow rate of the carrier gas (helium) was 0.6 mL/min. The MS detector was operated in the electron ionization mode (70 eV) with an ionization temperature of 230 °C. The mass spectra were recorded in electron ionization mode for m/z 30–550. The area percent method was used for the quantitation of the compounds present in the bio-oil. This method was used because the material was raw crude oil, so it assumes that the detector responds identically to all compounds. This method provides a rough estimate of the amount of analytes present, which calculates the area percent by taking the area of an analyte and dividing it by the sum of all the peaks. The value that remains represents the percentage of the analyte in the sample. The contents and individual compounds were also determined by comparing the spectral data with that in the NIST Mass Spectral library."
8,GC analysis of syngas,"2.7 GC analysis of syngas Syn-gas samples were collected at the different pyrolysis temperatures and were analyzed on the GC-2014 (Shimadzu Analytical Instrument, Japan) Gas chromatograph. The columns for the syn-gas analyses were two packed GC14 B glass columns. The detector for H2 gas was FID and for all other syn-gas components was TCD. The oven was programmed to hold at 55 °C for 8 min, ramp at 20 °C/min up to 250 °C and hold for 15 min. Both detectors were maintained at 150 °C. A mixture of standard gases was used as the internal standard for quantification. The heating values from gas compositional analyses were then calculated based on higher heating values of CO, H2, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 as conducted in previous investigations [32]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization XRD and NH3-TPD analysis was performed on the lignin-based char catalyst. The XRD analysis of pure bio-char seen in Fig. 1 A seems to have uniformity in its structure. The crystalline structure of pure bio-char does not seem to have high peak intensity as observed in the other catalyst [33]; the highest peak for the bio-char catalyst was at about 23 θ⁰ and had an intensity of around 1375a.u. The uniformity of the XRD for bio-char catalyst indicated that its surface was not very porous; it was smoother than the other catalyst which would result in decreased selectivity of valued compounds [34]. The XRD characterization of the zinc modified bio-char can be seen in Fig. 1B. The first observation that is seen is that its highest peak was around 27 θ°, the peak intensity for this angle was about 1625a.u. It was observed that zinc modified bio-char had a total of about 12 peaks that were recorded. The large amount of peaks detected by XRD analysis suggests a change in the crystalline structure of the catalyst. The porosity of the catalyst may have been improved which would lead to improved compound selectivity [24]. The NH3-TPD characterization of the lignin-based char catalysts can be seen in Fig. 1C&D. NH3-TPD analysis was used to determine the surface acidity of the catalysts, the peak temperatures in the results represents the strength of the acid, the higher peaks in the results indicate stronger acid sites while lower peaks are weaker acids [35]. The total peak area of the results represent the amount of acid, those with smaller areas were less acidic than those which had larger areas. The results that are seen in Fig. 1C show the NH3-TPD results for lignin-based char catalyst. Only one peak is distinguishable in the results which occurred around 750 °C; there was also a small bump that was observed around 400 °C. The higher peak allowed for a greater peak area which in turn made the catalyst more acidic. The surface acidity of the catalyst was calculated to be1.86 mmol/g. In the zinc modified lignin-based char Fig. 1D, the largest peak was also recorded around 750 °C, however there was a slight dip in the peak before the intensity increased again. In this catalyst it was also observed that there was a slight bump around 400 °C; the acidity of this catalyst was calculated to be 1.62 mmol/g. The total peak area for the modified catalyst was less than that of the pure lignin-based char which made it less acidic, this made it more suitable for compound selectivity in the bio-oil and these results are in accordance with the XRD results discussed previously [36]. The results of the BET surface analysis can be seen in Table 3 . It can be observed that the modification of the lignin-based char framework caused a reduction in the surface are of the catalyst from 279.08m2/g to 234.93m2/g. The reduced surface area is beneficial to the effectiveness of the catalyst [37]. Further analysis of the results showed that catalyst modification also caused a slight reduction in the pore volume, unmodified lignin-based char catalyst had a volume of 0.18 cm3/g and the modification reduced it to 0.16 cm3/g. The smaller volume in combination with the smaller surface area allowed for greater interaction with the vapors that passed through the packed bed reactor [38]. The pore size and the average adsorption pore width was another factor that was observed. The modified catalyst was observed to have a greater pore adsorption width which was 2.78 nm compared to 2.57 nm in unmodified lignin-based char. The increased pore adsorption with can be attributed to the improved efficiency of the lignin-based char after being modified with the zinc transition metal."
11,The general selectivity of the lignin-based char catalysts,"3.2 The general selectivity of the lignin-based char catalysts In the production of bio-oil, there are many variables that can affect the product outcome. The simple explanation for bio-oil production through pyrolysis is the heating of bio-mass feedstock in the absence of oxygen. The first part of this investigation was to identify which of the selected catalyst was effective in the production of high quality raw bio-oil. Co-pyrolysis experiments have been reported to be more suited for bio-fuel production because of the feedstock mixture [39]. Two repeated experiments were conducted for lignin/LDPE co-pyrolysis Fig. 2 . Lignin/LDPE co-pyrolysis differentiates from raw lignin pyrolysis. In thermal degradation experiments conducted by Dong and Ren [40,41], they explained that the presence of LDPE lowered the activation energy of the lignin biomass. The lowered activation energy also encouraged the formation of secondary and tertiary chemical reactions; the increased chemical reactivity was expressed as an increase in compound diversification. Based on the GC/MS analysis of the bio-oils obtained in this investigation this statement seems to be true. GC/MS analysis of the co-pyrolysis experiment that used unmodified lignin-based char as the catalyst revealed that the compound group that were recorded were Hydrocarbons, Phenols, Furans, Ketones, Guaicols and Acids which had 23.33%, 17.76%, 14.13%, 11.05%, 8.4%, and 4.61% respectively. These compound group percentages proved that the selectivity of valued compound with the use of unmodified lignin-based char is limited because the oil resulted in about 20% of the identified compounds not being able to fit in a group. The limited selectivity of unmodified lignin-based char catalyst is a result of the physical and chemical properties that the respective catalyst has such as the acidity, surface area and pore size [42,43]. This corresponds to the results obtained during the characterization of the catalyst seen previously in Section 3.1. Based on the GC/MS results obtained from the experiment, it was observed that the use of modified lignin-based char as catalyst was more effective. The results showed that this catalyst resulted in compound groups such as hydrocarbons, Ketones, Phenols and Guaicols which had 33.58%, 27.51%, 18.59%, and 11.96% respectively. Hydrocarbons are normally considered the most valuable group in bio-oil production because they can easily be converted into various grades of fuel or valued products [44,45]. These selected compounds are also reported to be very valuable because they serve as base materials for the production of various chemicals that are used in the pharmaceutical industry or the production of valued chemicals [20]. Based on the experimental results, the use of modified lignin-based char as a catalyst seems to be the better catalyst for the selectivity of valued compounds. This was concluded because the GC/MS results of the catalytic microwave pyrolysis were compared to that of the control experiment which was non catalytic co-pyrolysis, this resulted in a widely distributed bio-oil. The results showed that the oil was made up of 16.94% hydrocarbons, 12.25% ketones, 8.76% phenols, 7.60% guaicols, 7.06% acids, 3.89% esters, 2.40% furans, 7.27% alcohols and 0.96% sugars with about 32.88% of the compound not being able to fit in a valued group. These results prompted the second part of the investigation to further analyze co-pyrolysis experiments with the combination of the modified zinc-lignin-based char catalyst."
12,Optimization of the product yield using the central composite design,"3.3 Optimization of the product yield using the central composite design The use of zinc modified lignin-based char catalyst gave positive results in its general selectivity; this indicated that the attention of the investigation should be shifted to this catalyst and co-pyrolysis feedstock. In order to improve the product distribution a 22 central composite design was used to optimize the results of the pyrolysis process. In the design the ratio of LDPE to lignin (X1) and the temperature C° (X2) were chosen as the independent variables while the dependent variables were the product yield of the bio-oil, bio-char and syn-gas. In Table 4 , the results of the effects independent factors have on the product distribution yield can be seen. The model equation that was obtained using the ANOVA software on the product distribution resulted in a linear equation for Y1(bio-oil) and quadratic equations for Y2 & Y3 (bio-char & syn-gas). Ybio-oil = +19.12 − 1.75X1 − 0.87X2 Ybio-char = +47.89 − 0.44X1 − 0.20X2 + 1.50X1X2 + 1.38X1 2 − 0.32X2 2 Ysyn-gas = +32.82 + 2.23X1 + 1.00X2 − 1.69X1X2 − 1.5X1 21·5X1 2 + 0.65 X2 2 In the optimization of the results four experimental runs were ommited using the software. These ommision resulted with all of the P value being less than(<0.05); this indicated that the models were significant in predicting the yield for the components. The P value for the bio-oil, bio-char and syn-gas yield were 0.0009,0.0341 and0.0052 respectively. The significance also indicated that the presence of the modified lignin-based char catalyst is beneficial to the product distribution during pyrolysis [46]. The coeficient of determination or R2 value is another important factor that must be considered when analyzing the optimization results. The R2 value for the bio-oil yield was 0.9025, bio-char was 0.9521 and syn-gas was 0.9866, this meant that the three respective models can be used to predict the yield of the components during catalytic pyrolysis with the use of lignin-based char catalyst [46]. Bio-oil was the only component that resulted with a linear model that was significant in predicting the yield during pyrolysis. When analyzing the P values for the X1 and X2 factors (0.0005 and 0.0181 < 0.05) both were significant which meant that both the ratio of LDPE to lignin and the temperature played an important role in the amount of bio-oil produced during catalytic pyrolysis.This also meant that the linear model and the factors of the model was important in predicting the yield of the bio-oil. During pyrolysis bio-oil is considered the most valuable component so any optimization should be focussed on producing greater quantities and qualities of this component. The model that best represented the bio-char production was a quadratic model, however not all the factors were significant in predicting the bio-char yield. The X1X2 and the X1 2 were the only two factors in the model that had their P value being significant (<0.05). The X1X2 and X1 2 values were 0.0468 and 0.0096 respectively, this meant that these terms were the closest in the model representation, also it should be noted that the ratio of LDPE to lignin plays a more important role in the amount of bio-char that remain at the end of the pyrolysis process but the temperature also has influence on the amount of bio-char that remains [47]. Syn-gas was the third and final product that was recorded during the microwave pyrolysis. This too was represented with a quadratic model equation for the optimized results. When the P values for the factors were observed all of them were found to be significant (<0.05); the X1, X2, X1X2, X1 2 and X2 2 were found to be 0.0022, 0.0142, 0.0225,0.0047 and 0.0468 respectively. This meant that both factors played an important role in the quantity of syn-gas produced during co-pyrolysis of lingnin and LDPE. The results that were observed in Table 4 were used as the data in the ANOVA analysis. The general summary of the data was that there were 13 repeated experiments with two factors and three responses. The specifics of the factors had been discussed previously in section 2.4, the responses however were different, the bio-oil response had a minimum of 16.5% and a maximum of 21.9% with its mean value being 18.9%. The bio-char results had a minimum of 47.0% and a maximum of 51.3% with the mean value being 48.6%. The final response was the syn-gas, the mimimum amount of syn-gas that was obtained was 26.7% and the maximum was 35.7% with the mean value being 32.5%. The standard deviations for the three responses were 1.77, 1.49 and 2.38 respectively. In the optimization of the results, the response surface analysis was used, out of the thirteen repeated runs four of them were ignored for each of the responses in order to get the best posible fit for the model equations. The response surface analysis seen in Fig. 3 shows that the trend for bio-oil was affected by both the LDPE/lignin ratio and the temperature. This is in agreement with the predicted linear model discussed previously. Experimental runs that were conducted at 450 °C on average produced the most bio-oil, the highest quantity of bio-oil was produced at reaction conditions of 450 °C and 1.89% LDPE/lignin ratio, while the lowest quantity of bio-oil was produced at 550 °C and 20% LDPE/lignin ratio. The high ratio of LDPE to lignin is seen to reduce the quantity of bio-oil produced during the reaction. It was also deduced from the results that extremely high temperatures have negative effects on the quantity of bio-oil produced because at the highest temperature which was 591.42 °C the quantity of bio-oil that was recorded was slightly greater than the minimum value. This observation in conjunction with the negative effects of high amounts of LDPE suggests that the optimum conditions for bio-oil production are at the mid-point with 450 °C and 12.5% LDPE/lignin ratio because of the conistency and the resulting compound diversity. Out of the three components bio-oil is the most valuable because of its variety of uses [7,48]. The second component that was analyzed using response surface analysis was the bio-char, it can be argued that the optimum conditions of the bio-char production is the one that produces the minimum quantity. This is because majority of the investigations are focused on improving bio-oil yeild, it was observed that minimum quantity of bio-char was produced at a temperature of 450 °C and 23.11%LDPE/lignin ratio. While the maximum amount of bio-char was produced at 450 °C and 1.89% LDPE/lignin ratio. These results are in accordance with the quadratic models discussed previously. Experimental runs that were conducted at the mid-point had bio-char yield that were slightly above the minimum value, this meant that the mid-point conditions were also beneficial in the overall production depending on the desired product. The third and final product that was analyzed by response surface analysis was the syn-gas quantity. Ideallygas is valuable but not as valuable as the oil [49]. Depending on the desired product the amount of syn-gas that is desired should also be the minimum amount or complementary to the bio-oil quantity. The least amount of syn-gas was recorded at conditions of 450 °C and 1.89% LDPE/lignin ratio while the largest amount of syn-gas was recorded at 450 °C and 23.11% LDPE/lignin ratio. This again is in accordance with the quadratic model that was previously discussed. This is also important because it reassures the theory that the temperature and the LDPE ratio plays an important role in the quantity of the bio-oil produced during the reaction. The overall ideal conditions for product distribution during catalytic lignin co-pyrolysis is the center points because on average it produces a reasonable amount of bio-oil and syn-gas which are valued volatiles and lesser quantities of bio-char."
13,Chemical composition analysis of the optimized bio-oil production,"3.4 Chemical composition analysis of the optimized bio-oil production The next step in the systematic approach to determining the effectiveness of the modified lignin-based char as a catalyst was to analyze the compound composition of the bio-oil produced during pyrolysis under the various experimental conditions. The results of the GC/MS analysis of the experimental samples can be seen in Fig. 4 . At first glance the general understanding of the results were in correspondence with the general selectivity of the catalyst as discussed previously. Hydrocarbons are normally considered the most valuable group of components during bio-mass pyrolysis. This is because of their wide variety of uses especially as potential substitutes for fossil fuel. Out of all the repeated experiments the highest quantity of hydrocarbons was produced at conditions of 450 °C and 12.5% LDPE/lignin. On average the center point conditions produced higher quantities of hydrocarbons compared to the other conditions of lower or higher temperature and ratios. The amount of hydrocarbon that was recorded ranged from about 20% to 35%; this range in the compound distribution may have been caused by the reaction conditions [50]. The presence of LDPE in the feedstock mixture in combination with the heat provided by the microwave allowed for secondary and tertiary reactions to occur [27,51]. Whenever biomass is decomposed large molecules are broken down into smaller pieces, in this case the two initial components that were investigated was lignin and LDPE. Based on this alone we can begin to anticipate the types of compounds that will result from the decomposition process. The type of hydrocarbon that was most abundant were short chain hydrocarbon, many of the recorded compounds had double and triple bonds which is reflective of the original feedstock as well as cyclic hydrocarbons with the double and triple bonds. These compounds are a clear indication of the interaction between lignin and LDPE that occurred during their thermal decomposition [52]. Ketones was the second group of compound that was analyzed, this group of compound is also valuable because it has been reported to be used as starter products in several chemical industries, it can also be upgraded into valuable energy compounds [42]. The reaction condition that was recorded to produce the highest quantity of ketone was at 550 °C and 5% LDPE ratio. The general range for this group of compound was from about 10% to 28% of the bio-oil. It was observed that the mid-point conditions produced relatively decent amounts of compounds in this groups, this must be taken into consideration depending on the desired products during pyrolysis. The derived compounds that occur after pyrolysis is dependent on the initial feedstock, in this case the most abundant compound that was recorded in this group was 2-cyclopenten-1-one at all temperature ranges. The reaction conditions played an important role in the distribution of the ketone group in the bio-oil during microwave pyrolysis by facilitating the chemical interaction between the feedstock [53]. Phenol is the third group that has significant value in the bio-oil during pyrolysis; this group has also been reported to be valuable because of its uses in several other industries [42,54]. Careful analysis of the GC/MS results showed that the greatest quantity of phenols was produced when the reaction conditions were 550 °C and 20% LDPE ratio. The overall range of the phenol compounds were from about 1% to 21%, while the most abundant compound in this group was phenol and its derivatives at all temperature ranges. Again this is because of the chemical structure of the lignin before decomposition. On average these three components made up about ̴ 50% of the total bio-oil recorded, predominantly these are the three most valued components during lignin co-pyrolysis because of their use as potential fuels and as starting materials in several other industries. Apart from these previous components, the GC/MS analysis also revealed traces of guaicols, ethers, acids, esters, furans, alcohols, and sugars. The guaicol group was predominantly made up of phenol derived compounds but was considered as a separate group. The results of the analysis showed that this group was about 7% to 20% of the bio-oil. Methoxy-phenols- were recorded as the most abundant compounds in this group. These can also be considered valuable because they can potentially be upgraded into energy compounds or be used as starting materials for other valued products [55]. The trends observed in these results reaffirms that the two factors (X1) and (X2) in the experimental design plays an important role in the product distribution. The other components that had a sizable portion of the bio-oil were ethers, acids, esters, furans, alcohols and sugars. These groups represented about 1%-3% for ethers, 1%-6% for acids, 1%-7% for esters, 1%-6% for furans and 1%-13% for alcohols and 1%-6% for sugars. In all cases the experimental conditions affected the composition of the bio-oil, the most abundant compound for the recorded groups were short chain ethers for ethers, short chain carboxylic acids for acids, acidic esters for esters, Furan, 2,5-dimethyl- for furans, and2-furanmethanol for alcohols and allose sugars for sugars. The general selectivity of the modified lignin-based char was very good because on average only about <13% of the bio-oil was unable to be classified into one of the valued groups."
14,Optimization of the product composition of the bio-oil,"3.5 Optimization of the product composition of the bio-oil When bio-oil is produced during pyrolysis, some compounds are normally considered more valuable than others, in most situations these may be hydrocarbons, ketones, phenols and guaicols depending on the type [56]. The result of the bio-oil product composition was further analyzed using response surface analysis in order to identify trends in the production process. In the design of the analysis two of the factors were chosen which were the reaction temperature °C (X1) and the lignin/LDPE ratio (X2). Along with these factors four of the most valued compounds were chosen as the responses, hydrocarbon, ketone, phenol and guaicol. In the optimization of the product composition the ANOVA software was able to produce individual models that best represent them. Hydrocarbon composition resulted in a quadratic model, ketones and phenols both resulted in with linear models while guaicols resulted with a 2FI model, the resulting model equations can be seen below: Y Hydrocarbon = +33.77 + 2.29X1 − 0.19X2 − 0.55X1X2 − 4.40X1 2 − 5.42X2 2 YKetone =+14.95 + 14.40X1 + 0.90X2 YPhenol = +16.30 + 6.08X1 + 1.10X2 YGuaicol = +12.33-0.79X1 + 0.95X2 − 5.42X1X2 When analyzing the results of the models, the P value has great importance because it gives an indication if the predictive models are significant in predicting the respective product compositions. The resulting P values for hydrocarbon, ketone, phenol and guaicol were all significant <0.050 (0.0044,0.0145,0.0318 and 0.0019 respectively). Further analysis of the results showed that the R2 values for the model equations were close enough in predicitng the product composition. The resulting R2 value for hydrocarbon was 0.9677, ketone was 0.8163, phenol was 0.7482 and guaicol was 0.9385. These R2 values were close fit which meant that this is in accordance to the P values which is capable in predicting the compound composition in the bio-oil [57]. When the predictive modes for the individual components are analyzed one must also take into consideration the significance the X1(temperature °C) and X2(LDPE ratio) factors has on the responses. Hydrocarbon was the only component that was represented by a quadratic equation, out of all the factors in the equation the X1, X1 2 and X2 2 resulted with sigunficant P values <0.050. These respective P values were 0.0416,0.0042 and 0.0010, these results indicated that both factors had significat influence in the quantity of hydrocrbon produced during pyrolysis, however based on the significance of these individual factors the change in the reaction temperature played a more important role in the hydrocarbon content during microwave pyrolysis. Ketone component resulted with a linear model, analysis of the individual factors revealed that only the X1(temperature) had a significant P value. The respective P value was 0.0063, this meant that the change in temperature at the various reaction conditions affected the amount of ketone produced, this factor had more influence than the LDPE ratio which did not result in a significant P value 0.5337. The resulting model equation for the phenol component was also linear, analysis of the individual factors showed that only thew X1 was significant in predicting the component composition (<0.050). In this model the X1 factor resulted with its significant value being 0.0198, this meant that the temperature played an important role in the amount of phenol produced during microwave pyrolysis. The X2 factor was not significant since its P value was 0.3868, however it still played an important role in the product composition because of the interaction between the feedstock components at the different temperatures [58]. The final component that was observed was the guaicol fraction, this resulted with a 2FI model equation. The results of the individual factors for this equation varied, out of all the factors ony the X1X2 resulted with a significant P value 0.0009. This meant that the quantity of guaicol present in the bio-oil was affected by both the temperature and the LDPE ratio, the combination of these individual factors was able to determine the guaicol output. This is also evident if the indivual X1 and X2 factors are observed, even though they did not result in significant P values, 0.1589 and 0.1873 respectively, they are close enough to being significant which meant that they indeed affected the product composition [59]. The response surface analysis for the four major components can be seen in Fig. 5 ; the first bio-oil component that was anlyzed was the hydrocarbons. Observation of the quadratic model of the surface anlysis showed that the highest point was afected by both factors. The increase in the temperature as well as an increase in the LDPE ratio were beneficial to the quantity of hydrocarbond present. However based on the predictive response surface analysis it was observed that if both factors are increase too far it would result negatively. The quadratic model also showed that the change in temperature is more important because when the LDPE ratio was kept at the midpoint value the hydrocarbon content still had positive results. Another observation that was made was that hydrocarbons need high heat and LDPE because the lowest point on the surface analysis was at the minimum values, this may have been that enough energy was not supplied to the reaction to overcome the activation energy barier of the chemical reactions [40]. The second component was ketone, this was represented with a linear surface model (Fig. 5) which meant that the correlation between the X1 and X2 factors directly affect the component quantity. The surface analysis showed that the change in the LDPE ratio did not have significant influene on the ketone quantity. The highest point on the 3D surface was at 550 °C and 5%, the increase in the LDPE ratio at this temperature slightly lowered the ketone quantity while the reduction in the temperature at any LDPE ratio affected the quantity. This meant that the temperature in more directly related to this group than the LDPE ratio. The phenol component of the bio-oil was also represented by linear surface model, observation of the analysis was similar to those made for the ketone content, the LDPE ratio did not affect the quantity but the increase in temperature was directly related to the increase in phenol quantity. The highest amount of phenol was produced at 550 °C and 20%. The final valuable component that was observed was the guaicols, this was represented by a 2FI surface model. Observation of the surface anlysis confirmed that both factors affected the product quantity, there is a direct relation to the increase in guaicol quantity to the increase in one of the factors. However it can be seen that the LDPE ratio was a bit more influencial than the temperature in the product quantity. Another observation that was made was that if both factors are increased or decreased simultaneoulsy it negatively affected the product quantity. This affirmed the idea that the center point for the experimental conditions were optimum when producing high quality bi-oil."
15,GC analysis of the syn-gas produced during catalytic microwave pyrolysis,"3.6 GC analysis of the syn-gas produced during catalytic microwave pyrolysis Whenever biomass undergoes pyrolysis three components are produced, bio-oil, bio-char and syn-gas; it is established that bio-oil is the most valuable, however there have been investigations conducted by Gutierrez and Kuznetsov [60,61] into the potential use of syn-gas as valued products. The use of syn-gas from lignin pyrolysis would be very beneficial because it is essentially the waste product of a material that is already considered to have little value. GC analysis was conducted on the gas collected at various reaction conditions Table 5 , in all cases it was observed that the most abundant gas was hydrogen. Hydrogen is the lightest gas produced during pyrolysis [62], the changes in the quantities though are affected by the interaction between the feedstock and the catalyst that occurred in the fix bed reactor. The feedstock composition also affected the amount of hydrogen produced during pyrolysis, Brennan (2010) [63] explained that the presence of the LDPE at different reaction temperatures influenced the chemical reaction which in turn influenced the syn-gas composition. Another factor that affected the quantity of hydrogen available in the syn-gas was the heating method, microwave heating can produce microwaves that generate microplasma and hot spots, which promote heterogeneous catalytic reactions and produce a greater concentration of hydrogen in the resulting gas than convectional pyrolysis [62]. On average the quantity of hydrogen that was recorded was about 39% where the highest amount was recorded at 550 °C and 5% and the lowest amount was at 450 °C and 1.89%. Hydrogen gas is valuable because it can be used as a reducing agent in other chemical reactions, it has also been reported to be a potential source of gaseous renewable fuels [64]. Other compounds that had a sizable portion of the syn-gas were CO2,CO and CH4. Analysis of the gas composition showed that an increase in the reaction temperature caused an increase in the CO2 and CO quantities. A similar observation was observed in a study conducted by Baker [65], they explained that the increase in these components was caused by the oxidation of the carbonized bio-char at higher temperatures of pyrolysis. In their study as well as this current investigation it was observed that there were no significant variation of the other components in the syn-gas that was affected by the change in temperature [65,66]."
16,Conclusions,"Modified lignin-based char produced bio-oil that contained ̴ 80% valued compounds, the optimization of the product yield proved that the optimum conditions for bio-oil production using lignin/LDPE feedstock was at 450 °C and 12.5% LDPE/lignin ratio. GC/MS analysis of the bio-oil proved that the most valuable compounds that were produced were Hydrocarbon, Ketone, Phenol, and Guaicol. The major component composition of the bio-oil was optimized via response surface analysis; hydrocarbon composition was represented by a quadratic model. Results showed that hydrocarbon content in the bio-oil is affected by both the ΔC° and ΔLDPE ratio. GC analysis indicated hydrogen rich syn-gas was obtained."
