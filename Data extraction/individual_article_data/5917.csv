0,Introduction,"Aniline compounds are very important chemical intermediates that are frequently used in the synthesis of dyes, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and polymers [1–3]. Many useful strategies have been reported for the synthesis of aniline and its derivatives, such as hydrogenation of nitroarenes [4] and nitriles [5], reduction of nitroarenes and azides [6], amination of alcohols [7] and alkyl halides [8]. Among these strategies, the catalytic hydrogenation or reduction of nitroarenes is regarded as the most efficient strategy for the production of aromatic anilines, given the fact that nitroarenes are easily available chemical feedstocks. However, the reduction strategy traditionally used needs a stoichiometric amount of metal/acid or hydride [9] reagents as reductants, and a lot of undesirable waste is produced during the reaction, which is not environment-friendly. Besides these reduction methods, the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes is classified as an environmentally benign process, and is compatible with industrial processes since H2O is always the only byproduct during the reaction process [10]. But still limiting factors exist in the catalytic hydrogenation strategy, such as the use of noble metal catalysts that can increase the production cost [11]. Moreover, when noble metal catalysts and H2 (as hydrogen donor) are used for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes with reducible groups, such as halogen-, aldehyde and CC groups, the chemoselectivity is always not ideal [12,13]. A feasible way to resolve the above limitations is to replace the noble metal catalysts with earth-abundant transition metal based catalysts and avoid using H2 for the catalytic hydrogenation of various nitro compounds [14]. Up to now, significant efforts have been made to design efficient catalytic systems for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes using hydrogen donors, namely: formic acid [15], formate salts [16], alcohols and N2H4·H2O [17]. Recently, Beller's group has reported iron oxide-based catalysts for the chemoselective catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes using N2H4·H2O as hydrogen donor [18–20]. Since then, other iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs)-based catalysts have also been reported [21–23]. A Co3O4 NPs immobilized on an Al/Si-mixed metal oxide support has recently been reported for chemoselective hydrazine-mediated transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes [24]. All the above efforts have demonstrated that the use of earth-abundant transition metal-based catalysts for catalytic hydrogenation is entirely feasible in order to replace noble metal-based catalytic hydrogenation in the sustainable chemistry point of view. Thus, it is strongly desirable to design new and easily prepared transition metal-based catalysts for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes. In this effort, via a facile method, we successfully prepared ultrathin γ-Fe2O3 nanosheets (γ-Fe2O3-UNSs). γ-Fe2O3-UNSs proved to be a highly efficient catalyst for the chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes to corresponding aniline compounds, using N2H4·H2O as hydrogen donor. It is worth mentioning that, in the catalytic hydrogenation of halogenated nitro-compounds and other nitrobenzenes with reducible groups to the corresponding amines, 100% selectivity can be achieved. On the other hand, the catalyst can be easily recycled and the catalytic activity without an obvious decrease undergoes six consecutive reaction cycles. Hence, the γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst not only exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity but also has excellent recyclability and reusability. Thus, it should be a potential candidate for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes in a large scale."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs,"2.1 Synthesis of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs Firstly, 190mL ice-cooled aqueous solution containing 4mmol of FeCl3·6H2O and 500mg of 2-(2-[4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenoxy]ethoxy)ethanol was stirred for 10min in an ice-bath. Next, 8.8mmol of KBH4 was dissolved into 8mL ice-cooled water and quickly injected into the above solution. At the moment, the yellow Fe3+ solution quickly became colorless. After stirring for a few minutes at 0°C, the solution gradually changed into gray black. Then, the above solution was aged at 4°C for another 2h, where a black precipitate appeared. This black precipitate was separated by a magnet and washed twice with ethanol and dried overnight at 25°C."
3,Catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes,"2.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes Typically, 1mmol of nitrobenzene (123mg), 10mg of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst, and 5mL of ethanol were mixed in a 25mL two-neck flask reactor equipped with a reflux condenser. Then the above solution was refluxed at 80°C, followed by the addition of 4mmol of N2H4·H2O using an injection syringe. The reaction samples were collected every 10min using an injection syringe and then filtered. The reaction conversion and yield were estimated based on the analysis of the reaction product by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Agilent 5977E)."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2400) analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Perkin-Elmer PHI-5702), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2010) measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2F30, 200kV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, MIRA3 TESCAN), Raman spectroscopy (Jobin Yvon Lab Ram HR evolution), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR, Agilent cary 640) spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) measurements were made to characterize the prepared samples. GC-MS (Agilent 5977E) was employed for monitoring the reaction conversion and yield as stated above."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts The XRD pattern recorded is shown in Fig. 1a. The different diffraction peaks observed at 30.3, 35.7, 43.4, 53.9, 57.4 and 63.0° correspond to the crystalline faces of (220), (311), (400), (422), (551) and (440), respectively, and this is consistent with the crystalline phase of γ-Fe2O3 (No. 39–1346) [25]. The XPS was recorded to explore the element surface composition of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs. As shown in Fig. S1, Fe and O elements signals were easily observed. The high-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p shown in Fig. 1b is characteristic for iron oxide. The Fe 2p spectrum contains Fe 2p1/2 (723.8eV) and Fe 2p3/2 (710.3eV) peaks, in which these two satellite peaks are important characteristic features of γ-Fe2O3 phase [26]. Fig. S2a shows the FTIR spectrum of the prepared catalyst. The strong and broad absorption IR bands at 700–550cm−1 are due to the multiple FeO stretching mode of γ-Fe2O3. The IR bands in the range of 3500–1100cm−1 reflect the absorbed water and CO2 molecules in the KBr matrix [27]. Fig. S2b displays the Raman spectrum of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs. The vibration characteristic peaks centered at 225, 293, 412, 613, 665 and 1320cm−1 are important characteristic peaks of γ-Fe2O3 phase [28]. These characteristic peaks further confirm that the prepared catalyst is γ-Fe2O3. The SEM image of γ-Fe2O3 nanosheets shown in Fig. S3a reveals that γ-Fe2O3 nanosheets structure constituted by a number of nanosheets but without any obvious agglomeration to γ-Fe2O3 NPs. In Fig. 2a, the TEM image further confirms that the materials have ultrathin nanosheets structure. The HRTEM image of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs lattice fringe is shown in Fig. S3b. It is shown that the lattice fringes of γ-Fe2O3 phase are observed with a d-spacing of 0.252nm and 0.295nm, which corresponds to the (311) and (220) lattice fringe of γ-Fe2O3 [28]. As shown in Fig. S4, the energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX) spectrum also exhibits obvious peaks of Fe and O elements, result which is consistent with those of XPS. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were also employed for investigating the textural properties of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs (Fig. 2b). The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs exhibit type-IV isotherms, indicating that the catalyst has meso/macroporous structure. From the BET results, the catalyst has a large specific surface area and large pore volume of about 107.4m2 g−1 and 0.30m3 g−1, respectively. Also, the catalyst exhibits pore size distribution centered between 3 and 20nm (Fig. 2b). The large specific surface area of the prepared catalyst is obviously beneficial (concentration of active sites is proportional to BET) for enhancing its catalytic activity."
7,Catalytic activity of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst,"3.2 Catalytic activity of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst The prepared γ-Fe2O3-UNSs solid was used in the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene using N2H4·H2O as the hydrogen donor. Table 1 shows the reaction conditions screening obtained catalytic results in terms of product yield. As shown in Table 1, entries 1–5 (different solvent), the γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst shows an aniline yield of 100% with the solvent of ethanol and in the same reaction temperature (80°C). When the reaction temperature was reduced to 60, 40 and 20 °C, respectively, the aniline yield was decreased accordingly (Table 1, entries 6–8). When the catalyst usage was changed, aniline yields changed accordingly (Table 1, entries 9–11). Other iron oxides such as α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 NPs were also investigated. These show lower aniline yields as compared with the γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst (Table 1, entries 12 and 13). Thus, the γ-Fe2O3 appears to be the active site for selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. Metallic Fe NPs as catalyst also resulted in a low catalytic activity (Table 1, entry 14). In Table 1, entries 15–17, when different hydrogen donors such as formic acid, NaBH4 and H2 were used, very low aniline yields were also obtained. Without any hydrogen donor, the reaction did not occur (Table 1, entry 18). Therefore, ethanol as solvent, N2H4·H2O as the hydrogen donor, γ-Fe2O3-UNSs as catalyst and T =80 °C are the optimal reaction conditions for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene for the presently investigated Fe-based catalytic surfaces. The reaction mechanism of catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene over γ-Fe2O3-UNSs is suggested to proceed as follows (Fig. S5). Firstly, nitrobenzene and N2H4·H2O are adsorbed on the surface of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs. Secondly, N2H4·H2O dissociates providing hydrogen chemisorbed atoms associated with the oxygen anions on the surface of iron oxide (ca. Fe-O-H+ pair site), where N2 and H2O are eventually formed. Mobile hydrogen cations and electrons are captured by nitrobenzene to form nitrosobenzene. The nitrosobenzene might quickly convert to phenylhydroxylamine via hydrogenation. Because of the poor stability of phenylhydroxylamine, it can be easily decomposed to aniline under hydrogen cation conditions [29]. In this reaction, since N2H4·H2O dissociates to form N2 and H2O without other by-products, thus the catalytic process is considered environmentally friendly. As shown in Table S1, after comparing the reaction conditions such as the substrate dosage, activity site loading, reaction time, reaction temperature and H2 pressure for the supported Pd, Ru, Rh, Co, and Fe2O3-based catalysts [29–32], γ-Fe2O3-UNSs shows excellent catalytic activity and has potential for replacing noble metal catalysts for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. The γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst was then used towards the selective catalytic hydrogenation of various halogenated nitro-compounds to corresponding halogenated amines. As shown in Table 2 , entries 1–3, the catalytic hydrogenation of para-halogenated nitrobenzenes (I, Br, Cl) were investigated. The results indicate that 1-iodo-4-nitrobenzene, 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, and p-chloronitrobenzene are all fully converted to corresponding halogenated anilines with 100% conversion and selectivity. In order to explore the detail reaction process for the hydrogenation of para-halogenated nitrobenzene (I, Br, Cl), the real-time product yields in this reaction were recorded and are shown in Fig. S6. In Table 2, entries 3–5, chlorinated nitrobenzene with different substituent positions were also investigated, and the real-time product yields are shown in Fig. S7. As a result, catalytic hydrogenation of chlorinated nitrobenzene still has 100% conversion and selectivity in 1h. In Table 2, entries 6–7, the catalytic hydrogenation of 2-bromo-4-nitrobenzene and 3-bromo-4-nitrobenzenealso have 100% selectivity and very high conversion. Although 1-nitro-2,4-dichlorobenzene has two halogenated functional groups, the catalytic hydrogenation reaction still has 99.8% selectivity and approach 99% conversion in 2h, as shown in Table 2, entry 8. Expectedly, as shown in Table 2, entry 9, the catalytic hydrogenation of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene was also measured and 99.7% conversion and closed to 100% selectivity in 2h are obtained. In the catalytic hydrogenation of halogenated nitro-compounds, some noble metal-based catalysts showed comparatively low catalytic selectivity [33,34]. Thus, the γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst has excellent catalytic efficiency in the catalytic hydrogenation of halogenated nitro-compounds to corresponding halogenated amines. The catalytic hydrogenation of other nitroaromatic compounds was also investigated and results are also displayed in Table 2. Nitroarene with functional groups such as hydroxyl- (Table 2, entries 10–12), amino- (Table 2, entries 13–15) and methyl- (Table 2, entries 16 and 17) all can be hydrogenated to corresponding anilines with 100% selectivity. Other substituent groups, such as keto- (Table 2, entry 18), sulfuric acid amino (Table 2, entry 19), aldehyde groups (Table 2, entry 20), carboxyl (Table 2, entry 21), also have very high selectivity (close to 100%). The catalytic hydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-nitroaniline (Table 2, entry 22) also shows a conversion and selectivity of 100%. Although m-dinitrobenzene has two nitro groups, the catalytic hydrogenation product of m-phenylenediamine still has 100% conversion and selectivity in 2h (Table 2, entry 23). Therefore, the γ-Fe2O3-UNSs solid appears as an excellent catalyst for the chemoselective catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds. The magnetic behavior of the prepared catalyst was measured and the saturation magnetization curve is shown in Fig. S8. The γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst presents a saturation magnetization value of 56.8emu g−1. Thus, the γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst can be easily recovered from the reaction mixture by an external magnet (Fig. S8, inset). Here, the recyclability and reusability of γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst were also detailed investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 , using the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene as the model reaction, the yield of aniline was still above 98% after six consecutive reaction cycles. Therefore, the catalyst exhibits excellent recyclability and reusability. On the other hand, from the powder XRD (Fig. S9), TEM (Fig. S10), SEM (Fig. S11) and BET (Fig. S12) measurements of the recycled catalyst, the reused γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst almost maintains its morphology and surface texture, further indicating its stability with reaction time."
8,Conclusions,"A γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst was successfully prepared and used towards the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds with halogenated and other functional groups to corresponding anilines compounds using N2H4·H2O as the hydrogen donor. The γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity and almost 100% selectivity for the nitroarenes hydrogenation reactions. In addition, the γ-Fe2O3-UNSs catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction solution due to its superparamagnetic property. Furthermore, the catalytic activity did not significantly decrease after six consecutive recycled cycles. Therefore, the catalyst not only exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity but also has excellent recyclability and reusability, which may be suitable for further catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds."
