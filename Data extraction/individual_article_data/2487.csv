0,Introduction,"Environmental implications resulting from the production of chemicals are driving the researchers to find new facile, cost-effective and ecofriendly technologies affording high selectivity for the desired products. Benzaldehyde (BAL) is the simplest aromatic aldehyde among the aromatic compounds with high added-value. BAL is commonly used for a wide range of applications (e.g., as flavoring, fragrance, in fine chemistry and pharmaceutical industries). In general, industrial production of aromatic compounds (such as aldehydes) involves severe operating conditions. Moreover, heavy metals and corrosive oxidants are employed, leading to the production of large amounts of dangerous wastes for both humans and environmental compartments. This gives rises to develop environmental friendly processes in order to avoid these hard conditions used on the conventional production of aromatic compounds [1]. In this context, photocatalytic systems have earned increasing importance in this field, minimizing the harsh industrial conditions through both oxidation and reduction routes [2–5]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) based materials have been emerged as good candidates for selective conversion of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes, using sustainable light sources and molecular oxygen as oxidant (which is available in the atmosphere), while producing water as sole product [3,4,6–8]. Despite the great advances in the TiO2 photocatalytic organic synthesis, there are still relevant limitations in terms of selectivity and yield. The formation of reactive oxidation species (ROS) is one of most common disadvantages of using TiO2 and oxygen in the photocatalytic production of aromatic compounds. In many cases, a fast conversion of the substrate is observed, with consequent degradation of all molecules present in the reaction medium. Moreover, the high recombination rate of the charge carriers reduces the overall charge separation and diminishes the performance of the photocatalysts. Thus, efforts have been done to overcome some of these limitations by developing new photocatalysts. The pioneer work on the use of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as photocatalyst was reported by Wang et al. for the production of hydrogen from water [9]. Since then, this material has been used in a variety of (photo)catalytic applications [10]. g-C3N4 holds a smaller bandgap of 2.7 eV compared with TiO2 (∼3.2 eV), expanding the absorption from the blue side of the electromagnetic spectrum well in the visible, up to 450 nm (contrasting to the 380 nm absorption edge of TiO2). Additionally, the easy production of g-C3N4 by thermal decomposition of several low-cost nitrogen-rich precursors has made this polymeric semiconductor a promising material for the synthesis of aromatic aldehydes [11–13]. Unfortunately, g-C3N4 doesn’t meet ideal characteristics for practical applications due to the difficult recovery and separation after the photocatalytic reactions [12,14–16]. In this context, g-C3N4 based composites prepared with magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) have attracted increasing attention, in particular for wastewater treatment [17,18]. Several studies have reported the use of magnetic g-C3N4 composites for the degradation of a variety of organic pollutants in water, such as dyes [4,16,19–25], phenol [26], and antibiotics [17,27]. To the best of our knowledge, magnetic g-C3N4 based composites were never applied in the photocatalytic production of aromatic compounds. Thus, the novelty of the present work is the application of a highly-efficient photocatalytic process using a magnetically recoverable and recyclable g-C3N4 based material for the selective conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde, employing UV-LEDs as low-cost and energy-efficient source of light. Moreover, the magnetic g-C3N4 composites were studied for simultaneous production of BAL and hydrogen."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Dicyandiamide (DCN, 99%), iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate (98%), benzyl alcohol (BA, > 99%) and benzaldehyde (BAL, > 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (98%) and ammonium hydroxide solution (28%) were supplied from Riedel-de-Haën and Alfa Aesar, respectively. Sodium hydrogen phosphate (≥ 99.0%) was supplied by Fluka Analytical. Phosphoric acid (85.4%) was obtained from Fisher Scientific UK. Ultra-pure (UP) water was obtained in a Direct-Q Millipore system."
3,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.2 Photocatalyst preparation The synthesis of g-C3N4 bulk material was performed by thermal decomposition of DCN as described elsewhere [12]. Briefly, a semi-closed crucible was placed in a muffle furnace (Naberthern, P330) under air atmosphere with a selected step ramp until 550 °C. The resulting material was washed and dried for 12 h at 100 °C, and denoted as bulk gCN. Then, a post-thermal treatment was carried out in an open crucible for 2 h at 500 °C. The resulting material was labeled as gCN-T. The Fe3O4/gCN-T composites were prepared with different amounts of Fe3O4 (5, 10 and 20 wt.%, theoretical content). In a typical run, 400 mg of gCN-T was dispersed in 250 mL of UP water and sonicated for 1 h. Then, certain amounts of iron (III) chloride hexahydrate and iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate were dissolved in 50 mL of UP water and added to the gCN-T dispersion. The mixture was heated until 80 °C for 30 min, and 4 mL of ammonia were then added to allow precipitation of the magnetic nanoparticles. As the main objective is to magnetically recover and reuse the gCN-T photocatalyst, the response of the Fe3O4/gCN-T composites was primarily checked using a common magnet (see supplementary information, Figure SI-1). Among them, only that with the highest iron content was able to be completely separated from the liquid phase by the application of an external magnetic field. Thus, the photocatalytic studies were based on this material (20% Fe3O4/gCN-T)."
4,Characterization techniques,"2.3 Characterization techniques The specific surface area (S BET) was determined with N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained at −196 °C in a Quantachrome Nova 4200e apparatus. The morphology of the materials was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using a FEI Quanta 400FEG ESEM/EDAX Genesis X4 M instrument. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out in a PANalytical X’Pert MPD instrument equipped with a X’Celerator detector and secondary monochromator (Cu Kα λ = 0.154 nm, 50 kV, 40 mA; data recorded at a 0.017° step size, 100 s/step). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of the materials was performed by heating the sample from 50 to 900 °C at 10 °C min−1 rate under air flow using a STA 490 PC/4/H Luxx Netzsch thermal instrument. The materials were also analyzed using a diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectrophotometer, DRUV-vis (Jasco V-560), equipped with an integrating sphere attachment (Jasco ISV-469). DRUV-vis spectra were recorded in diffuse reflectance mode and converted to equivalent absorption Kubelka–Munk (KM) units. Indirect band gap of the catalysts was obtained from the respective Tauc plots using (KM.hν)1/2 units as a function of the energy (eV) [5]. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the resulting materials were obtained by using a spectrofluorometer (Jasco FP-8300) equipped with a 150 W Xenon lamp and a SCE-846 accessory. Excitation wavelength was set at 370 nm and the emission range was measured between 380–700 nm. Both excitation and emission bandwidth were fixed at 2.5 nm. Atomic absorption spectroscopy analyses were carried for determination of dissolved Fe using an AAS UNICAM spectrophotometer model 939/959."
5,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.4 Photocatalytic experiments The selective photocatalytic conversion of BA to BAL was performed in a cylindrical borosilicate reactor, filled with 50 mL of 1.5 mM BA aqueous solution. The photocatalyst load was fixed at 1.00 g L− 1. The system was continuously saturated with an inert gas flow (argon at 15 mL min-1) and maintained in the dark for 30 min before turning-on the LEDs (adsorption-desorption equilibrium). Then, the photocatalytic reaction started using four UV-LED (λmax = 392 nm). Light intensity reaching the reactor of each UV-LED was c.a. 487 W m−2, determined by using a UV–Vis spectroradiometer (USB2000+, OceanOptics, USA). Aliquots were periodically withdrawn from the reactor in order to quantify the BA and BAL concentrations by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) using a Hitachi Elite LaChrom system equipped with a diode array detector (L-2450), a solvent delivery pump (L-2130) and a Purospher Star RP-18 endcapped column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particles). An isocratic method using 20 mM NaH2PO4 (A), adjusted to pH 3.2 with phosphoric acid, and methanol (B) with a proportion of A:B equal to 30:70 for 16 min was employed. The conversion (C) of BA, selectivity (S) and yield (Y) to BAL were determined as described elsewhere [12]. Selected experiments under similar conditions (i.e., initial concentration of BA, catalyst load and irradiation source) were performed for determination of hydrogen during the photocatalytic conversion of BA. The reactor was filled with 100 mL of a BA aqueous solution. The suspension was first degassed using a nitrogen flow for 20 min, and then the light was turned on. During photocatalytic measurements, the N2 flow was maintained at 10 cm3 min−1. Hydrogen was detected on-line by using an Inficon Micro GC 3000 gas chromatograph equipped with a molsieve column and a micro-TCD detector, using argon as carrier gas. All the photocatalytic experiments were performed in triplicate. The reported data corresponds to the average over 3 independent runs. The standard deviation was never higher than 5%."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Materials characterization,"3.1 Materials characterization A very low surface area was found for the bulk material (4 m2 g−1), which was markedly increased to 87 m2 g−1 after the thermal exfoliation treatment (i.e. higher than that of the bulk material). On the other hand, the incorporation of Fe3O4 particles on the exfoliated gCN-T sample led to a decrease on the S BET (51 m2 g-1 for the as-prepared 20 wt.% Fe3O4/gCN-T material). This could be related to the high load of Fe3O4 particles (often described as having small SBET [18]), covering the gCN-T surface and thus decreasing the surface area of the resulting material. Representative SEM micrographs of neat gCN-T (Fig. 1 a) and of the composite (Figs. 1b and c) clearly reveal the differences in the morphology of these materials. In the case of gCN-T, a structure consisting of multiple splitted and rolled gCN-T layers is observed, resulting from the thermal exfoliation and exposure to air flow. This morphology has already been ascribed in the literature to similar g-C3N4 based materials, due to the reduction of layer interactions mainly driven by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds, which are very unstable at high temperatures [12,28]. After the incorporation of Fe3O4, the SEM micrograph shows spheroidal particles homogeneously covering the surface of gCN-T (Fig. 1b). These observations corroborate the results obtained from the N2 adsorption − desorption isotherms, for the composite material a lower SBET being obtained due to the high load of Fe3O4 particles on the gCN-T sheets. By using backscattered electron analysis (Fig. 1c), it was possible to spatially locate the particles presenting high-energy atoms (as Fe), as confirmed by EDS analysis in the Z1 zone (Fig. 1d). The XRD pattern of neat gCN-T (Fig. 2 a) clearly shows the presence of a strong diffraction peak at 2θ ≈ 27.6°, characteristic of the inter-layer staking of the conjugated aromatic features of graphitic materials identified as the (002) deflection. In addition, the peak at 2θ ≈ 13.0° is associated to the (100) deflection of interplanar stacking structures of tri-s-triazine polymeric units (JPCDS No. 87-1526) [12,29]. Diffraction peaks characteristic of Fe3O4 magnetite crystalline structure (JCPDS No. 75-0033) [30,31], along with the (002) diffraction line of g-C3N4, were observed in the XRD pattern of the hybrid material. The absence of the of g-C3N4 (100) diffraction line in the diffractogram of the composite material is indicative of the coverage of the g-C3N4 layers by Fe3O4 particles, as observed by SEM (Fig. 1b and c). In TG analysis (Fig. 2b), neat gCN-T and the Fe3O4/gCN-T composite were studied until 900 °C under air atmosphere, and the mass loss was determined in both cases. The gCN-T material shows good thermal stability until 550 °C. At higher temperature, the polymeric material rapidly decomposes until 750 °C. The 5% residual mass may be attributed to the presence of stable carbon species resulting from rapid pyrolysis of gCN-T at high temperatures, as previously reported by other authors [32]. In the case of Fe3O4/gCN-T, the mass loss observed in the TG profile at 100 °C may be attributed to the presence of water physisorbed in the composite material. A second mass loss was observed at c.a. 400 °C, being ascribed to the thermal decomposition of g-C3N4, which occurs at a lower temperature than for neat gCN-T (550 °C), due to the action of Fe3O4 which may catalyse the oxidation of the gCN-T phase under air atmosphere [33]. Moreover, the stage observed at ∼ 500 °C can be related with the oxidation of Fe3O4 to hematite (α-Fe3O4) [34]. A total mass loss of c.a. 78 wt.% was determined for the composite. The amount of Fe3O4 in the hybrid material was determined from the thermogravimetric results, by subtracting the mass loss of bare gCN-T to that obtained for 20% Fe3O4/gCN-T, i.e. 18%, which is in good agreement with the nominal Fe3O4 load estimated (20 wt.%) in its synthesis procedure. The DRUV-Vis spectrum of neat gCN-T shows the typical absorption edge of this material at c.a. 390 nm. The bandgap determined from the respective Tauc plot (Fig. 3 a inset) was ∼2.76 eV, as reported in our previous work [12]. A red shift in the absorption edge (to approx. 490 nm) and a broader absorption until 700 nm was observed for Fe3O4/gCN-T, indicating the existence of charge transfer between Fe3O4 and gCN-T [35,36] and leading to a significant band gap decrease (∼1.58 eV, Fig. 3a inset). Moreover, the existence of a significative absorption tail between 600 and 700 nm (Urbach tail), is indicative of the existence of midgap states, allowing the material to absorb photons with energy lower than the optical bandgap [37]. To better understand the effect of the incorporation of Fe3O4 on gCN-T, PL analyses were performed upon 370 nm excitation (Fig. 3b). Both materials reveal two distinct bands located between 400–600 nm. The first peak with a maximum at 450 nm corresponds to direct interband electron-hole recombination and the second minor band located at 525 nm is due to the radiative recombination involving charge carriers captured by traps [38]. Regarding the PL spectrum of Fe3O4/gCN-T, a significant quenching of the PL intensity is observed; this may indicate that the presence of magnetite on the composite may has the capacity of hindering the electron-hole recombination upon photoexcitation."
8,Selective conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde,"3.2 Selective conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde The effect of the magnetite incorporation on the efficiency of gCN-T for the production of benzaldehyde in water, using benzyl alcohol as precursor, was studied under UV-LED radiation. A negligible BA conversion (less than 2%) was observed in the absence of the photocatalyst and under argon atmosphere, demonstrating the photochemical stability of BA under the tested conditions. Moreover, under dark conditions, a maximum decrease of 3% in the BA concentration was observed for both gCN-T and Fe3O4/gCN-T. The efficiency of the magnetic composite was compared with neat gCN-T (1.00 g L−1 of photocatalyst load) in the production of BAL at different reaction times (2, 3 and 4 h, Fig. 4 ). In addition, due to high load of Fe3O4 on the composite, the results were also compared when using a gCN-T load of 0.82 g L−1, i.e. considering the gCN-T content in the composite, as determined by TG analysis (∼ 82%). A maximum selectivity (100%) was obtained at the end of 2 h of irradiation with gCN-T and Fe3O4/gCN-T, and respective BA conversions of 62 and 46%. A progressively loss in selectivity was observed when extending the reaction for 2 additional hours. Although the conversion of BA increased, the yield towards BAL production didn’t increase in the same proportion, which may be attributed to the overoxidation of BAL, as reported in previous works [12,39,40]. Moreover, for 3 and 4 h of reaction, a positive effect in the selectivity of the process was obtained by the incorporation of magnetic particles. The above results may indicate that the selected conditions in terms of photocatalyst load are reasonable in order to ensure a total absorption of efficient photons reaching the catalyst, i.e. the excess of catalyst is avoided. Based on these findings, the possibility of using a photocatalyst that can be easily recovered from the reaction system, may open a new pathway for selective organic production. Therefore, reutilization experiments using the magnetic composite were performed to assess the stability of the synthesized catalyst. Before each cycle, the photocatalyst was recovered with a magnet, thoroughly washed with UP water and dried for 12 h at 100 °C. As shown in Fig. 5 , the composite lost some efficiency but only from the first to the second run. Comparing the results at 2 h of irradiation, it was found that 100% selectivity to BAL was maintained during the 3 photocatalytic runs, the yield decreasing from 46 to 31% from the first to the second experiment. Atomic absorption spectrometry analyses were performed to evaluate possible iron lixiviation at the end of the photocatalytic reactions. The maximum concentration of iron was found after the first run (0.17 mg L−1), which is quite low even considering the limit for iron dissolved in drinking water (0.30–3.00 mg L−1), according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [41]. As previously referred, in heterogeneous photocatalysis under oxygenated conditions the common mechanism is the oxidation of the organic compounds due to the formation of highly reactive ROS [42]. In absence of oxygen, as in the case of the present study, the high amount of electron-rich nitrogen species in the graphitic structure of gCN-T may lead to an increased electron density, leading to higher interactions between the π-π bonds of the graphitic sheets and the aromatic ring of BA, promoting its conversion into BAL. According to the above results, under UV irradiation, the production of BAL occurs by photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA driven by photogenerated holes. Thus, accumulated electrons at the photocatalyst surface promotes the reduction of H+ present in the reaction medium (resulting from the dehydrogenation of BA and also from water), leading to the formation of hydrogen [12,43]. Organic compounds, such as methanol and ethanol are generally used as sacrificial electron donor for H2 production. These compounds react with photogenerated holes preventing charge recombination between electrons and holes. In this work, neat gCN-T and Fe3O4/gCN-T composite were used as photocatalysts for H2 production using BA as sacrificial electron donor. Typical reactions were performed under similar condition used for photocatalytic production of BAL. The main goal was to assess the effect of the presence of Fe3O4 and the reutilization of the Fe3O4/gCN-T composite in the overall H2 production efficiency. In fact, H2 generation was followed during the photocatalytic reactions using neat gCN-T and Fe3O4/gCN-T (Fig. 6 ). It was found that both catalysts were able to promote H2 generation, the highest efficiency being obtained using the magnetic material, which is in line with the results of the conversion of BA to BAL. The above results show the great potential of Fe3O4/gCN-T as photocatalyst for the simultaneous production of BAL and H2. Moreover, the possibility of easily recover and reuse of the catalyst, as well as the use of UV-LEDs as low-cost and highly efficient radiation sources, both account for the ecological and economical advantages of the proposed system."
9,Conclusions,"Neat gCN-T and Fe3O4/gCN-T catalysts were efficiently used for photocatalytic production of BAL from BA conversion. Among all the materials prepared, only the composite composed by 18 wt% of Fe3O4 showed magnetic response. The reutilization reactions proved that neat Fe3O4/gCN-T composite has good stability for BA conversion under the reaction conditions used. By atomic absorption spectroscopy analyses was obtained negligible iron levels during the successive runs, proving that Fe3O4/gCN-T can be safely used for fine chemical production. Hydrogen is simultaneously produced during the photocatalytic conversion of BA into BAL. This accounts not only for neutralization of the medium, since its source results mainly from the reaction of H+ available from water as well as from the dehydrogenation of the alcohol, by means of the photogenerated electrons."
