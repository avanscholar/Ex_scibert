0,Introduction,"Methyl glycolate (MG) is an important fine chemical intermediate, which can be used as a raw material for the synthesis of polyglycolic acid and other organic chemicals [1]. Ethylene glycol (EG) has benign properties and versatile functions, and it has been proposed as a raw material for producing many chemicals, including polyester, dynamite manufacture and antifreeze [2]. Several approaches envisioned for the production of MG have been reported [3,4]. Typically, severe reaction conditions were required to obtain a high yield of MG. For the production of EG, the primary route was the hydration of ethylene or fermentation of sugars [5–7]. However, these routes were limited for the shrinking oil and expensive bioprocesses. In contrast, the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) to MG or EG is attractive as it is a more efficient and greener catalytic process (as seen in Scheme 1 ) [8]. EG can be achieved efficiently over copper-based catalysts via selective hydrogenation of DMO [9–11]. However, low MG yields (<83%) were obtained over copper-based catalysts [10,12], and the instability of the catalyst limited its further application. To improve the selectivity to MG in hydrogenation of DMO, introducing a noble metal to the catalytic system is required. For example, CuAu alloy nanoparticles and a silver-based catalyst were applied for the hydrogenation of DMO to obtain a high yield of MG (>90%) [13–15]. However, the large requirement of the noble metal limited its further application in industry. Thus, it is desirable but more challenging to design an efficient non-noble metal catalyst to catalyse the hydrogenation of DMO to MG under mild conditions. Because of their high catalytic efficiency and stability, the transition metal phosphides have been attracting increasing attention. Recently, many efforts demonstrated that the transition metal phosphide catalysts showed excellent activities for hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation owing to its strong noble metallic properties [16–20]. To the best of our knowledge, the transition metal phosphides have scarcely been reported in the hydrogenation of esters to their corresponding alcohols. Based on the above understandings, we hypothesise that it would be a huge breakthrough if the transition metal phosphides could replace the noble metal and be used for the DMO hydrogenation efficiently. In this work, a bifunctional Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst was proposed. The catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of DMO to MG. A high selectivity of 88.0% to MG with a 93.0% conversion of DMO was obtained under 210°C. More importantly, the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst displayed an excellent stability, which can be successively performed for 3600h without deactivation under 230°C."
1,Experimental,"The Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst was prepared by temperature-programmed reducing method. The catalysts were characterized by ICP, XRD, TEM, XPS, BET, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD. The catalytic performance evaluation was performed in a vertical fixed-bed reactor (i.d. 12mm, length 600mm) made of a stainless steel tube. Details of catalyst preparation, catalyst characterization, and catalyst evaluation are available in the supporting material."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The textural properties derived from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the TiO2 and Ni2P/TiO2 catalysts are listed in Table 1 . Compared with TiO2 support, the BET surface area and average pore diameter of the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst decreased while the average pore volume enhanced. To understand the structures of the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst, XRD, TEM and XPS characterizations were performed. Fig. 1A shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2 support and the as-prepared Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst. For the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst, the three peaks positioned at 2θ=40.8, 44.7, 47.5 are assigned to the (111), (021) and (210) lattice planes of Ni2P (JCPDS 65-9706), respectively. Fig. 1B shows the typical TEM (a) and HRTEM (c) images of the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst. The HRTEM analysis revealed that the crystal domains within Ni2P NPs had an interfringe distance of 0.22nm, which is close to the lattice spacing of the (111) plane in face-centred cubic (fcc) Ni2P crystal (0.221nm) [21,22]. Fig. 1C (a) displays the XPS spectra of the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst. The XPS spectrum for the fresh Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst shows Ni (2p3/2) and P (2p3/2) peaks at 856.5 and 133.3eV, respectively. The Ni (2p3/2) binding energy is consistent with the range of those reported for Ni (855.6–856.6eV) in Ni(OH)2 [23,24] while the P (2p3/2) binding energy is in good agreement with a value reported for P (133.3eV) in Ni3(PO4)2 [24,25]. As a result, the peaks at 856.5 and 133.3eV are assigned to Ni2+ and P5+ species in the Ni2P, respectively. Meanwhile, additional peaks are observed in the Ni (2p3/2) and P (2p3/2) regions at 852.9–853.3eV and 129.1–129.5eV, respectively, which are assigned to reduced Ni δ + (0< δ <2) and P δ − (0< δ <1) in Ni2P [26,27]. The XPS for Ni metal and elemental phosphorus are reported to be at (852.5–852.9) and 130.2eV, respectively [28]. A positive shift of 0.25–0.65eV to 853.15eV was observed for Ni (2p3/2) binding energies in the Ni2P catalyst (Fig. 1C), while a negative shift of 0.7eV for the P (2p3/2) signal to 129.5eV was obtained. These results verified that a few electrons were transferred from Ni to P. These results, combined with the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and TEM results further corroborated the formation of Ni2P NPs. In addition, the accessible surface acidic sites of the catalysts were probed by NH3-TPD (Fig. S1 in ESI†). Compared with TiO2 and Ni/TiO2, the NH3 desorption temperature of the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst shifted towards higher temperature. This result reflected that the addition of P increased the acidity and acid strength of the catalyst, as the formation of P-OH in the surface increased the Brønsted acid and the formation of electron-deficient state of Ni verified by XPS improved the Lewis acid [27]."
4,Catalytic test,"3.2 Catalytic test Table 2 presents the results of the hydrogenation of DMO over TiO2 (entries 1–2), Ni2P (entries 3–8), and Ni2P/TiO2 (entries 9–15) catalysts. As shown in Table 2, the pure support of TiO2 was inactive towards DMO hydrogenation, while a 38.2% conversion of DMO was observed with Ni2P as the catalyst at 200°C (entry 3). Therefore, the Ni2P sites account for the catalytic hydrogenation performance. Additionally, it can be observed that the Ni2P catalyst exhibited a good selectivity of 90.5% to MG with a conversion of 38.2% under 200°C. With increasing temperature from 200 to 280°C, the conversion of DMO increased from 38.2% to 98.4%, whereas a drastic decrease in the selectivity of MG was found (from 90.5% to 51.0%). The main by-product was MAC, indicating that high temperature was beneficial to the dehydration of MG. In comparison, the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst displayed higher activity with a high selectivity of 89.7% to MG under 200°C, implying that the presence of TiO2 support is important for improving the catalytic efficiency since it can promote the dispersion of Ni2P active sites. The effect of support on the dispersion of the active metal site was also investigated in literature [29–31]. Moreover, the conversion of DMO improved greatly from 84.2% to 100% as the reaction temperature increased from 200°C to 230°C while the selectivity of MG decreased slightly. The highest yield of MG was 82% under 210°C which is close to that of highly active noble-metal catalysts (90%) [14,15]. As a comparison, the silver-based (Ag/SiO2) catalyst, which was commonly used in the literature [14], was tested for the hydrogenation of DMO to MG under the same conditions, and its catalytic activity was lower than the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst (as seen in Table S1, entries 1–3 in ESI†). Furthermore, the effects of the reaction pressure on the hydrogenation of DMO over the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst (Table 2, entries 12–15) were studied under 230°C. It can be found that the MG selectivity reduced greatly from 76.0% to 56.3% while the EG selectivity increased gradually from 15.0% to 35.5% with the reaction pressure increasing from 3 to 6MPa. This result suggested that high pressure was in favour of the hydrogenation for another ester group of MG to EG. Additionally, the generation of dehydration and etherification products (MAC, EtOH, EM, DME) might be resulted from the weak acid sites of the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst (Fig. S1 in ESI†), which was also reported in the previous work [32,33]. The superior hydrogenation activity of the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst possibly resulted from the physicochemical properties of Ni2P. XPS characterizations verified that the Ni atoms in the Ni2P structure possess a small positive charge, which can promote the adsorption of Ni2P sites to C=O (the electron donor) in DMO and decrease the interaction between OH (the electron acceptor) in MG and Ni2P. Additionally, the P atoms in the Ni2P catalyst might have the same effect as the additives in the bimetallic catalyst, including Ru–Re or Ru–Sn, which is called ensemble-effect in catalysis [34]. The ensemble-effect of P in Ni2P can lower the number of exposed Ni atoms and the interaction between the electron acceptor (OH) and Ni2P sites, consequently, enhancing the selectivity of MG."
5,Stability test,"3.3 Stability test Since the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst presented super activity and high selectivity in the hydrogenation of DMO to MG, the long-term performance over this sample was conducted to explore the stability at 230°C. The decline in the catalytic activity of the catalyst did not appear after operating for 3600h time-on-stream (Fig. 2 ). Concurrently, the product distribution did not show obvious fluctuation during the complete test, suggesting that the catalyst was rather robust under these conditions. Furthermore, a comparison of the TEM (Fig. 1B (b and d)), BET, ICP (Table 1) and the XPS spectra (Fig. 1C (b)) of the spent catalyst with that of the fresh one suggested that there was no evident change in the structure of the catalyst during the reaction. These results reflect the high stability and reusability of the catalyst. The high stability of the catalyst can be ascribed to the strong interaction between Ni2P and the support, which was confirmed by the characterization of TPR (Fig. S2 in ESI†). Moreover, the small positive charge of Ni and the ensemble-effect of P in Ni2P can also prevent the sintering of Ni2P crystallites to enhance the stability at higher temperatures."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, a bifunctional Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst which was prepared by H2-temperature programmed reduction was developed for the high selectivity hydrogenation of DMO to MG for the first time. The Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst exhibited a substantially high catalytic activity and selectivity under 210°C. A conversion of 93.0% to DMO and a high selectivity of 88.0% to MG were observed. In addition to the strong noble metallic properties, the super catalytic properties were attributed to the electron-deficiency of Ni and the ensemble-effect of P in Ni2P. Moreover, the catalyst displayed an unexceptionable stability. It was performed successively for 3600h in the gas-phase hydrogenation of DMO under 230°C without any evident deactivation. It is thus reasonably demonstrated that the Ni2P/TiO2 catalyst is promising and has good potential for producing MG from DMO on a large scale."
