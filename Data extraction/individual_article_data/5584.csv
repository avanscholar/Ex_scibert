0,Introduction,"Electrode reaction is a special kind of heterogeneous catalysis process, where the electrode is both the media for electron transfer and the place where catalytic reaction proceeds. Its specific character comes from the effect of electrical double layer (EDL) and the surface electronic field, and therefore not only the general rules for heterogeneous catalysis influence the reaction rates, but also the surface electronic field does. The basic process of electrode reaction involves five steps: (I) mass transfer process in electrolyte: reactant particles transfer toward electrode surface; (II) pre-surface-transfer process: the pre-transfer process of the reactant particles at the electrode surface or the electrolyte layer near the surface, such as surface adsorption or chemiadsorption; (III) electrochemical process: gain or lose electron(s) at the electrode surface and generate reaction products; (IV) post-surface-transfer process: the post-transfer process of the products at the surface of electrode or the electrolyte layer near surface, such as desorption from the surface, or other chemical change of the products such as compose/decompose; (V) new phase formation and products transfer: products form new phase, such as bubbles or solid deposition layers, and then transfer from the electrode surface to solution or to inner electrode. For electrochemical HER in alkaline electrolyte, the general procedures for electrode reaction also rules it. Specifically, the reactant is water molecules in alkaline HER, and the pre-surface-transfer process includes the cleavage of water, followed by the H/OH adsorption on catalyst surface. Here the electrochemical process refers to Heyrovsky step; at higher Had coverage, the Heyrovsky step is substituted by Tafel step. The post-transfer process refers to desorption of OH– and H2 into the electrolytes. As mentioned, for electrochemical reaction, many important processes take place in the electrical double layer (EDL), such as the desolvation of hydrated cations, and charge transfer between electrode and reaction intermediates. We also note that species transport resistances in EDL are responsible for the overpotential and increased energy losses [1]. Therefore, evaluating the HER reaction at the electrode surface and EDL is of great importance to understand the mechanism underlying the reaction. The electrical double layer, lies at the interface of electrode and bulk solution, is consist of three parts that including the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), and the diffuse layer [2]. Among them, IHP is the most essential part in electrochemical reaction, for it is the place that those specifically adsorbed species resides, which involves solvent molecules, reactants, products and reaction intermediates, and any other specifically adsorbed molecules or ions on the electrode [3]. Alkaline HER, as an essential segment of electrochemical water-alkali and chlor-akali devices, has been widely paid attention to for producing hydrogen with high mass energy density and feasible storage. Compared with the electrolyzer operating in acidic ones, alkaline electrolysis could reduce the cost from membrane, and the choice of catalysts is widened to non-precious metal-based catalysts aside from noble-metal-based catalysts. On the other hand, as the simplest reaction in alkaline environment involving water molecules, full understanding of the impact of species in EDL for alkaline HER would inspire the designing of other water-involving reactions, such as CO2 reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Especially, for constructing full water splitting cell, the OER is the bottleneck step due to a more sluggish kinetics than HER counterpart [4]. For these reasons, the HER as performed in an alkaline electrolyte has been intensively developed for H2 production. The reaction equations of alkaline HER compared with acidic HER are shown below: Volmer step (Tafel slope of ∼118.2 mV dec−1): (1.1) H3O+ + e− + * ⇆ H* + H2O in acid HER (1.2) H2O + e− + * ⇆ H* + OH− in alkaline HER Heyrovsky step: (Tafel slope of ∼39.4 mV dec−1) (1.3) H3O+ + H* + e− ⇆ H2 + H2O in acid HER (1.4) H2O + e− + H* ⇆ H2 + OH− in alkaline HER Tafel step: (Tafel slope of ∼29.6 mV dec−1) (1.5) 2H*⇆ H2 for both Generally, the Tafel slope can be used as a reference to deduce the rate determining step (RDS) for HER. The values for Volmer, Heyrovsky, and Tafel reactions are 118.2, 39.4, and 29.6 mV dec−1, respectively. Between 39.4–118.2 mV dec−1 the RDS is the Volmer–Heyrovsky step, while between 29.6–39.4 mV dec−1 it represents a Volmer–Tafel mechanism. For alkaline HER, the Volmer step involving water dissociation is likely the RDS for most of the catalysts with sluggish water cleavage abilities, due to the drastically diminished H+ concentration. Combing back to the EDL model, specifically, in alkaline HER, the adsorbed species refers to water, adsorbed H and OH dissociated from water molecules, hydroxyl ions (OH–) evolved from adsorbed OH (OHad), hydrogen bubbles, and specific cations from the electrolyte. In OHP, non-specifically adsorbed ions with their solvation shell reside near the electrode by electrostatic forces, and the charge of ions in OHP is primarily opposite to the electrode. The diffuse layer that involves loose layer of anions or cations that balances the whole electricity of the double layer, as described by Guoy and Chapman [5]. It is worth noting that for the conception of interfacial water, although not clearly defined to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it generally refers to the water molecules inside the EDL when applied in electrocatalysis [6–8]. Combining the dynamic process of alkaline HER and static adsorption of molecules/ions, a simplistic view of the EDL at the electrode is proposed here in Scheme 1 . Interfacial water at the EDL is firstly attracted into the IHP, and dissociates into intermediate H and OH that are absorbed on the electrode. The H then combines another H atom to form H2, which subsequently diffuses into the bulk layer through the interfacial water; while OH gets one electron and passes through the interfacial layer too, probably with the help of hydrated alkali metal cations (AM+). Despite the widespread acceptance for the importance of EDL, significant challenge still exists on two aspects: one is to investigate how the changes in EDL impact the alkaline HER activities, and the other is that the methods to detect the interfacial species are still lack, both of which impede the unravelling of reaction mechanisms, thus making function-oriented design of the catalysts difficult. The difficulties mainly arise from two aspects. Firstly, the EDL is typically 1–10 of nanometers thick, depending on solute concentration [9]. Such a thin layer means a relatively low concentration of reaction intermediates that are too hard to observe, and therefore more sensitive surface probing equipments are required. Secondly, the reaction intermediates in EDL during the reaction must be studied in-situ, as the instantly changed electric field at the electrode surface determines the instantaneous structure of EDL. At the meantime, the electrolyte further complicates the common techniques for probing electrochemical systems, including microscopic and spectroscopic methods. Once the electrolyte/applied bias is missing, some reaction intermediates, i.e. Had, OHad and OH– will unavoidably diminish or disappear. As a result, ex-situ methods cannot always guarantee correct link between the chemical variation of the interface and the electrochemical activity, and in-situ techniques are indispensable for detecting the intermediates in EDL during the electrochemical process [10]. Despite the difficulties in unravelling the electrochemical process happening in EDL, researchers have devoted to developing available methods to detect the real changes in EDL during the reaction, which are summarized here (Scheme 1) as a guidance for improving our understanding of the effects of EDL on heterogeneous electrochemical reactions. This review introduces the readers to the literature focusing on the effects of species inside EDL in alkaline HER. Although previous reviews have summarized the effects of electrolyte cations in EDL in electrocatalytic process [11], our review provides a more comprehensive view of EDL and a more focused field of alkaline HER. Specifically, the effects of water molecules, reaction intermediates (Had, OHad/OH–), cations in electrolyte, and H2 bubbles on reaction mechanisms are comprehensively covered to gauge the full impact of EDL. Main conclusions are drawn as below: i) water molecules not only serve as an important reactant, but also have hinder effects on mass transformation; ii) whether Had could still be regarded as the sole descriptor for HER in base environment like in acidic one, is challenged; iii) the kinetical and thermodynamical effects of OHad for the alkaline HER are well-studied, and between them which is more important is still not settled; iv) the effect of cations in electrolyte could boost the OH– transfer and polarize water molecules; v) hydrogen bubbles, although less focused, show importance for HER under high current densities; vi) these species in EDL are highly correlated with each other, therefore hindering researchers to isolate the effect of each other; vii) the catalysts themselves, also undergo structural evolution, which also induces the EDL reconstruction during the electrochemical processes. Methods for studying EDL are also highlighted, which are believed to inspire more researchers to gain related data on each catalytic system, therefore further revealing the real HER process in alkaline HER. At the end, the review discusses the existing problems in the field of alkaline HER, as well as prospective on future improvements. This review article is aimed to provide a basic understanding of alkaline HER process and an outlook for hunting better catalysts for industry."
1,Species inside EDL,
2,Interfacial water,"2.1 Interfacial water As a typical polar molecule that is composed of two positively charged H atoms and one negatively charged O atom, water molecule can interact with catalyst surface through hydrogen bonds or other chemical interactions [12]. Unlike in acidic HER with hydronium ions as the reactant, in alkaline electrolyte, water molecules are generally regarded as the reaction resource for hydrogen evolution, as shown in the reaction mechanism equations as displayed in Section 1. Consequently, the interfacial water layer in EDL must be an important part that affects the overall HER performance in base. Indeed, there are three major hypotheses related to the interfacial water, i.e. hydrogen binding energy (HBE) theory, bifunctional theory and potential of zero free charge (pzfc) theory, regarding the differences between acidic HER and alkaline HER (the pH-dependent performance). The HBE theory suggests that the apparent hydrogen binding energy is tuned by the structure of the interfacial water in EDL through affecting the H adsorption behavior on the electrode; [13–15] the bifunctional theory, in contrast, suggests that the dissociation of interfacial water is the key step for Pt in alkaline HER [16,17]. The pzfc theory, however, clearly emphases the shuffling effect of interfacial water [8,18]. The key discrepancy between the three theories is the role of interfacial water. As suggested by Jia et.al., the HBE theory focuses on the binding energy of interfacial water on catalysts, while the bifunctional theory focuses on the dissociation of interfacial water, and for pzfc theory, it claims that the reconstruction of interfacial water is the most important [19]. In this section, we will address the Janus effect of interfacial water: weak adsorption of water on catalysts leads to insufficient reactant supplement; on the other hand, strongly-bounded water molecules at EDL with large reorganization energy serve as a kinetic barrier for ion transportation. The latter point has been less addressed till now. We classify the impact of water dissociation in Section 2.2.3, because the energy barrier for water cleavage depends heavily on the OH adsorption energy. 2.1.1 Water molecules as the reactant As the reaction resource in alkaline HER, timely supply of water molecules is highly proposed. As far as we know, the polarized water molecules interact with each other through hydrogen bonds with stabilization energies of 20−40 kJ mol–1 [20], and therefore they tend to bind with each other rather than with catalyst surface if no strong hydrogen bonds or chemical interactions are formed between catalyst surface and water [21]. Without such strong bonding between H2O and electrode surface, water molecules are hindered to access the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), as shown in Fig. 1 a, let alone the following reduction process. On the other hand, during water dissociation process, accumulation of hydroxyl ions (OH–) derived from water molecules will inevitably increase the pH value around the active sites. If water is not timely supplied (i.e. weak water adsorption), the continuous catalytic reaction will be suppressed, and even the catalyst itself might suffer from poor stability due to surrounded oxidative OH− [22–24]. Some reports also suggest that the hydroxyl ions absorbed on the catalyst surface could compete with water adsorption, consequently making alkaline HER kinetic slower [25–27]. Hydrogen bond is widely accepted to play important role in attracting water molecules to material surface and enhancing water adsorption [28]. Hydrophilic groups (as listed in Table 1 ) tend to attach to H2O molecules instead of interacting with each other, and therefore they can form hydrogen bonds with water. [21] Apart from them, those species that contain oxygen, such as –O [29], –OH [20,23], CO and CO in CO3 2− [30], are also perfect ligands for developing hydrophilic surface due to that those groups tend to form H bonding with H3O+/H2O and pull them closer to the electrode surface. Chai group highlighted the hindered interfacial mass transfer in alkaline HER and the importance of developing interfacial water supply. By surface OH group introduction, the overpotential of Fe/graphene catalyst was reduced by 220 mV [23]. First-principle calculations on catalyst with and without surface OH group give the visualized pictures of relative electron density distribution in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. The hydroxyl group with rich electrons can attract water molecule more easily and tends to bond it through hydrogen bonding. When the water layer is enhanced, the conclusion that surface OH group makes water aggregation and adsorption more favorable, does not change (Fig. 1d). [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase with amino residues can provide efficient proton transport pathway, therefore attracting H2O molecules through strong hydrogen bonding with the pendant amines and forming water-rich channels for timely proton supply to those active catalytic centers [31]. Cooperating oxophilic materials such as MoP [32], Mo2C (although also through hydrogen bonding with water from the surface ligands) [33], perovskite oxides [34], MXenes containing –F, –Cl, –O, –OH goups [35], cobalt-based selenides (Co0.85Se) [12], and sulfides (Co9S8) [36,37], is also an effective and facile method to modify the hydrophilicity of material surface. The charge between Co atom and P atom is unbalanced in CoP due to the presence of both edge-sharing and face-sharing configurations in it, which facilitates water dissociation on it. However, the inferior water adsorption hinders its performance in alkaline HER. Cao et al. reported that the hybridization of Co9S8 greatly boosts its performance by acting as water attractor, from 208 mV to 155 mV@10 mA cm-2. Indeed, for some traditional catalysts that show high HER activities in acidic HER such as Pt, MoS2, and MoSe2, inferior alkaline HER activities might be due to the poor water affinity caused by their intrinsic structure [38–41]. Taking MoS2 as an example, its dominated orbital consists of Mo 4 d z 2 and S 3px,y orbitals in the outermost sublayers, yet the d z 2 could not reach the surface because of the steric effect, while the 3px,y has impropriate orientation. Thereby, the water adsorption of MoS2 is essentially hindered (Fig. 1e, the lower panel). In view of this, they tuned the orbital orientation of MoS2 layer by heavy C doping. Partially changing S to C could induce orbital redistribution, and the sp2 hybrid in the outermost sublayers of MoS2 creates one perpendicular p orbital, which is effective for water adsorption (Fig. 1e, the lower panel) [28]. The overpotential decreases from 228 to 45 mV through C doping. For the situation of Pt, its 5d orbitals are fully occupied, and it therefore is difficult to interact with water molecules because of the Pauli repulsion between them. Ni or Co doping on Pt could narrow the 3d states of the doped element, consequently introducing new sites for interacting with water [42]. For open-structured catalysts, the metal atoms exposed to the electrolyte might suffer less from the problem of water adsorption, because the positively charged metal atoms are regarded as effective water adsorption sites in alkaline HER26 since water is a polar molecule. For those materials such as CoB [43] CoS2 [44], CoSe [12], et. al., modifying the electron density on metal sites might be an effective method toward improved water adsorption. For example, N-doped CoS2 with more positive Co sites showed higher water affinity than CoS2 [45]; positively charged Co atoms in Co0.85Se/Pt also has a lower water adsorption barrier than that in Co0.85Se [12]. Xie et al. suggested that the oxygen-doped Co2P with higher valence of Co caused a more facile water adsorption by density functional theory (DFT) calculations [40]. Despite the mentioned methods, designing a catalyst with fine surface structure (porous or rough) [46], creating vacancies [47] and phase control (from 2H to metallic 1 T phase) [48,49] can also tune the hydrophilicity of a catalyst. It is also interesting to find that water adsorption energy is related to solution pH by a quantum mechanics molecular dynamics (QMMD) study. After constructing a water-Pt interface by QMMD method at under-potential adsorption of hydrogen (Hupd) range in-situ, it can be concluded that when the applied potential goes more negative, the water molecule is more unfavorable to attach the electrode, resulting in an increased hydrogen binding on the catalyst [50]. 2.1.2 Interfacial water as barrier layer With most of the researches focusing on the role of water adsorption at the catalyst interfaces, it should be noted that the specific feature of the alkaline HER environment is that adsorption/desorption of reactants and products are proceeding through the interfacial water layer [51]. Therefore, the possible shuffling effect of interfacial water should also be considered. One of the most famous propose of the shuffling effect of water is proposed by Feliu and Koper group, known as the pzfc theory. In this theory the pzfc indicates that to what extend the interfacial electric field influence the interfacial water. The pzfc impacts alkaline HER kinetics by influencing the re-organization of interfacial water, and a high re-organization energy barrier at high pH values leads to a harsher OH– transfer crossing the EDL [8,52]. Their key observation is that the adsorption peaks for Pt (111) measured by CV are very close under various pH, while their HER performances are different (decreasing with enhanced pH, Fig. 2 a), and therefore aplying HBE theory to explain the pH-dependent performance seems inappropriate. By way of contrast to HBE theory, they studied the interfacial solvent reorganization by combined methods including impedance measurement, Tafel slope as well as laser-induced temperature-jump experiments, and discovered that Hupd adsorption is slower in alkaline electrolyte for Pt(111), and they explained the observation by interfacial water reorganization. The Hupd and HER occur closer to the pzfc under acidic condition, in comparison with that under alkaline one. Therefore, at the potential of Hupd and HER, the interfacial electric field shows a strong impact on the interfacial water, which engenders more difficult interfacial water reorganization. As a result, the hydrogen step is slower under alkaline environment. However, by anchoring Ni(OH)2 on Pt(111), the water reorganization barrier becomes lower, and the proton/hydroxide transfer throughout the EDL is easier (Fig. 2b,c), resulting in an improved HER and a lowered Tafel slope of 41 mV dec−1 from 116 mV dec−1. It is worth mentioning that the pzfc theory suggests that the HBE cannot solely describe the HER kinetics in alkaline solution. Instead, the water reorganization energy barrier plays a key role in determining the hydrogen adsorption rate, and this corresponds to the distance between the pzfc value and the actual electrode potential [8]. Differently, Jia et al. in their very recent work explained the shuffling role of interfacial water for HER/HOR intermediates from another view of point. They did not attribute the improved HER activities induced by transition metal cooperation on Pt to the negatively shifted pzfc, but to the facilitated water shuffling near the electric field. It is found that TM0 or TM(OH)x with high oxophilicity can host the water dissociation product in alkaline environment (OHad) more easily through the hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) mechanism, therefore leading to a facile OHad removal from the catalyst surface (Fig. 2d) [19]. The reason why electrochemical proton transfer is dependent on pH can also be explained by a model from the view of entropy [53]. The premise in this view is that only when the catalyst is of high activity (catalytic process is fast), the entropic barrier for ion transportation becomes rate determining. The entropy of H+ in outer Helmholtz layer is expected to be independent of the pH value of the bulk electrolyte, just as it is for Had (Fig. 2e). When the proton transfers from bulk solution to the electrode surface, the entropy is converted into enthalpy, and the higher the pH is, the lager the amount of entropy converts. Besides that, the determinative role of water structure has also been proved by theoretical calculations. When pH = 0, hydrogens tend to point toward the surface, and the proton transfer barrier is relatively small. Yet when pH is 14, all hydrogens point away from the surface, and this induces an extra proton transfer barrier (Fig. 2f,g) [54]. Also, Monte Carlo simulations indicate that on metal surface, negative charge is essential for facilitating the proton transportation to the metal surface [55]. Interfacial water configuration, which is of high importance to determine the HER performance of catalysts especially in highly active ones, is highly sensitive to the intrinsic physiochemical properties of the catalyst, surface structure, pH of the bulk electrolyte, applied potential on the electrode, hybridization and cations/anions/intermediate adsorbents in the system. Earlier in 50 years ago, Trassatti et al. have addressed that interfacial water arrangement differs from material to material [56]. Tian et al. developed “borrowing Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) activity” and SERS/Raman spectra, and based on these experimental results, they built conception models for H2O absorbed on Pt, Pd and Au material surfaces. The model indicates that on Pt surface water adheres through a chemically adsorbed hydrogen monolayer, while on Pd surface water molecule adsorbs directly, and on Au surface water attaches on it through hydrogen atoms [57]. Interestingly, 1T and 2H phase transition-metal chalcogenides (MoS2) also show differences in active site amounts and how the sites interact with interfacial water. The amorphous one with one active site shows negligible dependence on the solution pH/cations, while for 1T-MoS2, there are two active sites highly dependent on interfacial water, and the interfacial water is highly related to cations in solution/protons (hydrogen or deuterium) [58]. Even for the same material, the surface structure (such as steps) could impact the interfacial networks to influence the alkaline HER performances [59,60]. This was concluded by an integrated rotating disk electrode (RDS) which could obtain data of aberration-corrected TEM and in-situ XAFS at the same time (Fig. 3 a). The atomic steps with lower coordinations can react at a lower potential, introduce contraction at the surface, and disturb water networks at the interface, by these ways impressing the activity of electrocatalysts [6]. The pH value of bulk solution can also influence the interfacial water. Shao studied the vibrational behaviors of interfacial H2O from a wide pH range on Pt surface via the surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3b). According to vibrational wavenumber changes, when pH was increased, the binding strength of interfacial water and hydrogen monotonously weakened. As the weak adsorption of water on the surface increases the distance of surface Pt and interfacial water, the electron transfer between them is hindered [61]. Kinetic isotope effects (KIE) have also been adopted to study how interfacial water impacts HER kinetics [19,62,63]. If the alkaline HER process just includes water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, the measured KIE values would show a discrepancy with the theoretical value. Instead, the second KIE for hydrogen oxidation reaction on Pt(111) is pH-sensitive. This result implies that in alkaline environment, the interfacial water plays an important role, and it could boost the H adsorption process as well as the whole hydrogen reaction kinetics (Fig. 3c). It is also suggested that at low pH, the role of interfacial water network is not as important as that at high pH [63]. The potential dependence of interfacial water has also been investigated [64–66]. In Tian’s recent work, [7] by means of Raman spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) they distinguished two kinds of interfacial water orientation on Au electrode after fitting the Raman data with AIMD. The test mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 4 a, and the corresponding Raman data are shown in Fig. 4b. The interfacial water basically is free at the potential of zero charge (PZC), and its orientation is parallel to the surface, as schemed in the inset of Fig. 4c (region I). When the applied potential is -1.34 V, the water structure converses to one-H-down arrangement, as suggested in region II. The one-H-down orientation further becomes two-H-down when the potential achieves -1.85 V (Fig. 4). Besides, sum frequency generation (SFG) results indicate that when the potential reaches the PZC, interfacial water is randomly oriented, or parallel to Au surface, and sulfate anion adsorption appears at more positive potential [7]. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results from another research suggest that without applied potential, about 50 % of the interfacial water on Au surface is parallel to it, yet at negative bias, the interfacial water seems to be similar with bulk water [9]. Apart from single-component catalysts, metal oxides/hydroxides decorated metal surfaces have also been studied in the view of interfacial water reorganization. Koper et al. found that by the aid of nickel on Pt(111) surface, the H adsorption barrier is reduced under high pH, resulting in improved HER kinetics [8,67,68]. Feliu et al. demonstrated that nickel cooperation promotes the rate of HER, and pushes the PZC or potential of maximum entropy closer to the equilibrium potential of the HER. This makes the interfacial water network more disorder, which facilitates proton diffusion throughout the double layer, therefore improving the alkaline HER. The same group also doped Ni(OH)2 with several coverages on Pt(111), and the overpotential decreased from 270 to 90 mV cm−2, and by combining CV, CO displacement, FTIR and laser-induced temperature jump, they obtained the same conclusion with that of Ledezma-Yanez et al. [52] The Ni3N/Ni interface is also proposed to be able to facilitate interfacial water reorganization, which then promotes the proton/hydroxide transportation across the double layer and thus the HER/HOR kinetics [69,70]. Interfacial water structure/reorganization can also be affected by cations, anions and intermediate adsorbents. The effects of ions are classified to the following sections (2.2)."
3,Interfacial ions,"2.2 Interfacial ions 2.2.1 Had Had on catalyst surface has been proved as an important descriptor for HER in acidic media [24,70–75]. However, whether it can be a sole descriptor of alkaline HER remains unclear. Traditionally, only the HBE was adopted as the descriptor for HER/HOR kinetics. The pH-dependent HBE can be measured by hydrogen underpotential-deposited (Hupd) desorption peak (Fig. 5 a). Yan group is the first to propose that Had should be the sole descriptor of alkaline HER. They have compared a series of metals and build a volcano plot between HBE and HER performance (the exchange current densities) to confirm this proposal [76]. A following theoretical calculation also gives the same conclusion [77]. However, the Hupd peaks of Pt(110) step and (100) surface are found to change with pH by ∼0.15 V from pH 1−13. This anomalous pH effect on Hupd peaks do not agree with the Nernst equation [78,79]. At the same time, the catalyst with weaker binding energy of H (i.e. gold-group metals) does not perform better at higher pH as predicted by the HBE mechanism [76,80]. With these questions, Yan et al. have gradually modified the HBE theory. In their research article in 2014, they proposed that although OH species do not directly adsorbed on catalysts, they participate in the reaction by adjusting the alkalinity (OH− concentration) of the electrolyte, which regulate the HBE and therefore affect the HER activity [76]. Later in their research, they came up with the conception of apparent HBE (HBEapp). In this proposal, hydrogen adsorption is influenced by both the Had binding and the competitive interfacial water adsorption, therefore causing the shifts for CV peaks at different pH. In addition, unlike the apparent HBE, the intrinsic HBE, as a physic property, is believed to not alter with pH but the material itself [15]. Goddard group verified the HBEapp theory using quantum mechanics molecular dynamics (QMMD) simulations. On Pt (100) the water binding energy decreases with increased pH from 0.2 to 12.8 [50]. The weakened adsorption of water induces a higher hydrogen binding energy. They also found that the changes in HBE influence water reorientation. Although HBE does not vary with pH [81], the water adsorption energy is pH-dependent as the water dipole changes with applied bias. It is also found that the Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationship can apply to Δ G H , a p p 0 and the HOR/HER activity (Fig. 5b), as previously reported results that the elementary steps involving adsorbed H2O follow BEP relationship [82,83]. Yang et al. further provided compelling evidence that on platinum, specific adsorptions do not occur, and the pH-dependence of Hupd peak is more related to interfacial water rather than OHad [84]. The presence of water destabilizes Had, while the hydrated hydronium ions near Pt surface further weakened the H-Pt binding [85]. In the very recent research of Jia et al., in-situ XAS results evidenced that the O is facing the Pt surface (H2O↓ad) in alkaline Hupd region, and excluded the specific adsorption of cations and OHad. They conclude that the sharp Hupd peaks are yield from the competition between the solvated water molecules and Had [86]. Alternatively, Koper et al. gave optional explaination for the peak shifting in CV measurements. They suggest that water does not influence hydrogen adsorption on Pt(111) based on the similarity of experimental results (with water) and DFT calculation results (under ultra-high vacuum) [87]. In 2013, they proposed a model that can explain three observations: i) the OH adsorption at step site has not been found; ii) H-step and H-terrace shows different CV peak shapes; iii) H-step peak has a pH-dependence of 50 mVNHE/pH unit, which is unusual, and the model indicates that both H adsorption/desorption and its competition with O/OH show impacts on the H-step peak [78]. In 2017, they found that on a stepped Pt single-crystal electrode, the pH influences the H-step peak through cation-hydroxyl co-adsorption rather than H adsorption [88]. The later year, they provided further evidences that the pH-induced shifts of 0−0.4 V (vs. RHE) is a combined consequence of the solution phase cation concentration and pH. The presence of OHad in the “H-region (0−0.4 V)” on non-(111) facets is further proved by infrared adsorption spectroscopy and CO displacement studies [89]. Meanwhile, Janik et al. addressed that K+ specifically adsorbed on catalyst significantly impacts OHad rather than Had according to their DFT calculations [90]. Markovic et al. also highlighted the role of non-covalent interactions on platinum [91]. Indeed, facing so many explanations on Hupd peaks, Yan et al. have reviewed the experimental/theoretical results of Markovic, Koper, Janik, et al., and found that their Δ G H , a p p theory can fit all these results [92]. Recently, Shao group pointed out that despite the achievements by the former studies on Hupd, the active intermediate in alkaline HER is likely to be the hydrogen atoms adsorbed on top of Pt (Hatop), instead of the under-potential deposited H (Hmultiple) [61]. The Hatop is not changed by cations in electrolyte (Fig. 5c,d). Based on ATR-SEIRAS spectra recorded from 0.2 to -0.05 V in acidic, neutral and alkaline solutions, it is found that with the increase of pH, the Hatop binding energy reduces. This energy is then denoted as HBEmeasured so as to be distinguished to the former conceptions of HBE and HBEapp. The HBEmeasured is found to be synergistically affected by the H coverage, H-water, water-Pt interactions, and electric field, according to authors’ control experiments (Fig. 5e). They also indicate that weaker interaction of Pt-water at higher pH hinders the charge transfer, which in turn slows down the reaction kinetics at high pH. 2.2.2 OHad/OH− As revealed by the reaction equation (2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−), the alkaline HER is composed of a Volmer step (H2O + e− ↔ Had +OH−), Heyrovsky step (H2O+ Had +e− ↔ H2 +OH−) or Tafel step (2Had ↔ H2) [93]. Both in the Volmer step and Heyrovsky step, the by-product, OH, is generated, and the OH at the reaction interfaces attracts the interest of researches [94]. One view is from thermodynamic aspect that OHad binding energy can serve as an equally important descriptor besides H binding energy, because an optimized host of hydroxyl generated from water dissociation could facilitate alkaline HER process [27,95], while another view is that OHad does not participate in HER directly and thermodynamic explain of OHad is not suitable. In this section we summarized current knowledge of OHad in alkaline HER and the factors affecting the OHad. Moreover, the transfer from OHad to OH− is also highlighted. In acidic HER, the RDS is generally the Tafel step, i.e. hydrogen combination. Meanwhile, the situation in alkaline HER is more complicate. Both the Volmer step (i.e. water dissociation) and concomitant interaction of catalyst surface and the water dissociation products impact the overall reaction rate. The high water dissociation barrier is the limit of some excellent HER catalysts with optimized Δ G H such as Pt and MoS2 [96–98]. Obviously, to lower the water dissociation energy barrier we need to strengthen the H/OH adsorption on the catalyst surface [99–104]. Yet based on the Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi-type (BEP) principles, [105] too strong adsorption of OH will instead cause high occupy of reaction intermediates on catalyst surface, therefore poisoning the water adsorption and H adsorption sites. Therefore, from a microscopic view, appropriate OH-binding energy that is neither too strong nor too weak is expected. Bifunctional theory highlights the thermodynamic role of OH in alkaline HER. The theory, proposed by Markovic group, is initially proposed to question the HBE theory in alkaline HER [17]. Their very first study introducing the bifunctional theory is the one focusing on the Ni(OH)2/Pt catalyst, [106] where the Ni(OH)2 plays the role of dissociating water molecules, and the neraby Pt surface adsorbs one H (H ↔ Pt-Had) while Ni(OH)2 adsorbs one OH (Fig. 6 a). Also, the best coverage of Ni(OH)2 is ∼40−45 according to their result, further indicating that Ni(OH)2 is for OH interaction. The activity of Ni, Ag and Cu can also be enhanced by cooperation of Ni(OH)2 through bifunctionality (Fig. 6b) [107]. Ni3N doped with Mo, W and V with optimized H adsorption energies showed low onset overpotential, while only Mo doping with favorite OH adsorption energy boosted the alkaline HER with low Tafel slope, indicating the importance of both H and OH species for alkaline HER [108]. For Co4N, Cr doping is found to be able to accelerate water dissociation with a good HER activity, for which the overoptential is only 21 mV @ 10 mA cm−2 [109]. Although the bifunctional mechanism has been widely used to explain the enhancement of alkaline HER for heterogeneous catalysts, [110,111] Gasteiger et al. questioned strongly some essential arguments about the bifunctional mechanism [77]. In their research, the energy barrier for H2O to donate Had is relatively low, and Had formation shall be a very fast reaction on Pt surfaces. As H2O is always the dominant species in the electrolyte at a wide pH range (1–13), it therefore is available to clear Had for the HOR even in alkaline. Another question is that although Ir is the most oxophilic catalyst compared with Pt and Pd, it does not show the highest alkaline HER activity, and this phenomenon is against the proposal advanced by Strmcnik et al., who suggest that a more oxophilic surface might promote the Volmer step by facilitating the interaction with H2O/OH−. Therefore, they concluded that OH− adsorption/water dissociation does not rule HER in base [112]. Tang group’s researches are also against the bifunctional mechanism [113]. They analyzed the voltammetry data with microkinetic modeling, and the results suggest that the OH-mediated mechanism seems not to be capable for Pt(110) (Fig. 6c), instead, the OH slows down the HER rate by behaving as a spectator that equilibrates rapidly and reduces available catalytic sites. This founding indicates that only considering the thermodynamic adsorption energies of H and OH are insufficient for alkaline HER. Later they extend the analysis method to the bifunctional case, Pt(111) with TM surface clusters [114]. In this study they confirmed that the enhanced OH bonding does benefit the HER kinetics, but the way it influence the reaction is more likely to be indirect, rather than directly participate in alkaline HER. The indirect way might be either modifying the electronic distribution at the surface to stabilize transition state intermediates, or changing the orientation/dynamics of interfacial water layer [68]. After proving that the bifunctional mechanism is unsuitable for single-component catalysts or composite catalysts, they then analyzed the impact of Ru(OH)x on the (111) or (110) of Pt [68]. CO displacement experiment results (Fig. 6d) addressed that Ru(OH)x doping effectively lowers the pzfc, and as the doping amount increases, the pzfc value decreases gradually. They suggest that the pzfc value could be referred as a descriptor for alkaline HER. Negatively shifting the pzfc has two effects on water-catalyst interactions, the first one is to grab water molecules closer to the catalyst surface, and the second is to decrease the electric field at surface to make water structure more influent. Of them which factor plays a greater role is yet to be found. Lately, Koper et. al. emphasized the importance of both H and OH adsorption for alkaline HER. They proposed a 3D HER activity volcano rule for catalyst design, in which both H and OH adsorption energies are used as axis (Fig. 6e), that qualitatively captures trends in alkaline HER kinetics [110]. Although the dataset used to plot the volcano trends are limited as the authors claimed, we believe it is of interest to compare other catalytic system with this trend to evaluate the availability of the 3D volcano trend. Recently, the kinetic influence of OH− has also gradually been uncovered [115–118]. In our recent work, we highlighted the adsorbed hydroxyl transfer kinetics as a descriptor of alkaline HER. The study is based on designing platforms with similar adsorption energies of water and hydrogen, i.e. Ni-MoSe2 and Co-MoSe2, with the aim of isolating the OHad transfer process (OHad + e– ↔ OH−). Both experimental (CV, contact angle test and zeta potential test) and theoretical results evidence that Ni-MoSe2 obtains a more optimized adsorption of OHad and an easier desorption of OH– compared to Co-MoSe2, therefore favoring the kinetics of OHad to OH–, boosting the alkaline HER (Fig. 7 a-d) [116]. Huang et al. applied microscopic Hamiltonian model to the Volmer step for alkaline HER [117], which involves the electronic interactions, bond breaking, solvent reorganization, and double-layer electrostatic effects (Fig. 7e,f). Contributions of various factors have been quantitatively evaluated; 1/4 of the HOH bond energy entry into the activation energy, and at a more charged catalyst interface, the larger activation is not due to a more difficult solvent reorganization process, but rather due to a higher work for OH– to pass through the double layer, which is also named as a larger work term. Jia et al., who developed the 2B theory, also put forward the import role of facilitating the transportation of the adsorbed OH to free OH– [115]. It is still not clear that how OHad affects the kinetics of HER, although the promoting effect of oxophilic components on Pt with proper HBE is a unified agreement. Therefore, tuning the OHad is still a hot field in alkaline HER [17]. Markovic et al. showed that the OHad-M2+δ bond strength might be used as the primary descriptor to describe catalyst activities in alkaline HER on 3d metal hydro(oxy)oxide-Pt catalysts, indicating that the OHad of a catalyst can be changed by hybridizing different metal hydro(oxy)oxides with different oxophilicities [91]. The role of pH on OHad is also studied by Kuznetsov et al., who analyzed the potential-dependent current under the guide of kinetic modeling, and exhibited that the binding energies of Had and OHad on Ni have no concern with NaOH concentration (pH). They attributed the different HER performances in acidic and alkaline electrolytes to the interfacial water layers instead [119]. Notably, Sun group [104] suggested that surface electronegativity could also affect OH binding energy. Two catalysts, Pt3Ni/C and acid washed acid-Pt3Ni/C were prepared, and the latter one is slightly more negative surface charge known from Zeta potential tests. The negative charge is considered to originate from the surface-doped Ni(OH)2. By columbic repulsion, the strong negative surface charge on the Pt3Ni/C helps the adsorbed OH on the surface to transport to the bulk, thereby facilitating the Volmer step and advancing the HER performance. They also proposed that CO adsorption and oxidation can be regarded as novel descriptors to predicate alkaline HER activity (Fig. 8 c-e) [104]. In a recent research, the absorption state of interfacial water is found to determine the energy barrier for water dissociation. The more coordinated structure of the water is, the higher the dissociation energy [120]. 2.2.3 Cations in electrolyte Cations induced by metal salts in electrolyte generally locate in EDL through three ways: specifical adsorption on electrode surface, quansi-specifical adsorption on surface, and electrostatic interaction with the surface. Evidences for the three states have been comprehensively elaborated in the review of Li group [11]. As well, the affection of cations on electrochemical reactions are summarized in that review. Their main ideas are included here for the readers’ brief understanding. Cations that specifically adsorb on the electrode surface can block the catalytic sites; the potential drop caused by cation adsorption and distribution would affect the driving force for electron transfer. Moreover, the cations would interact with the interfacial electiric field as well as the electric dipole moments and polarizbilities of adsorbed intermediates, chemically interact with the reaction intermeidates, and alter the interfacial water structure. The hydration of cations act as a buffer of the interfacial pH. Here we would like to discuss the effect of cations specifically on the topic of alkaline HER. For the case of alkaline HER, cations affect the alkaline HER rate mainly through tuning the OHad and OH− transfer. It is found that cations with different hydration energies (Li+ >> Na+ > K+ > Cs+) that non-covalently adsorbed on Pt impact the adsorption nature on Pt differently. The higher the hydration energy is, the stronger the interaction is, resulting in different HER activities (Fig. 8a). For instance, the Li+-H2O and Li+−OHad interaction is stronger than that of K+-H2O and K+−OHad, and therefore promoted HER performance of Ni(OH)2/Pt catalyst. This phenomenon is explained as follows: the hydration of Li+ in the compact region of the EDL induces a complex of Ni(OH)2-Li+−OH-H, and then water dissociation is likely to be enhanced possibly via reduced steric effect and/or electronic effects on the interfacial water structure and reactivity [106]. Jia et al. recently investigated the effect of (OHad)-water-alkali metal cation (AM+) adducts, and proved that its presence in the EDL attributes to OHad removal toward bulk solution in the form of OH−-(H2O)x-AM+, according to the hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) theory, so as to boost the HER [115]. In line with the theory, free OH– is a Lewis hard base yet OHad is a Lewis soft base with nearly neutral charge, therefore, OH– binds with the Lewis hard acid (AM+) more tightly compared with OHad. In this way an unbalanced binding energy emerges due to the unbalanced charge between OH– and OHad, and this difference pushes OHad away toward the bulk solution, in which way enhances the Volmer step in HER (Fig. 8b). It also should be noted that this article is against the pzfc theory or HBE theory. The effect of cations in electrolyte on OHad is also observed by other researches. Koper et al. evaluated how the present of alkali cations on I–V response and CO stripping on Pt in base solution using CV method. A strong impact on the OHad according to the nature of cations was found, especially, Li+ and Be2+ could significantly weaken the repulsive force between OHad in the OH adlayer, therefore influencing the OH adsorption behavior [121]. Janik et al. simulated the effect of specifically adsorbed OH and K+ on Pt(100) and Pt(110), demonstrating that at the low potential, the adsorption/desorption on these facets contribute from the competitive or co-adsorption of hydroxide. The K+ can easily bind to Pt low-index facets and attenuates the binding strength of OH on them [90]. Despite of the limited reports on the effect of cations on OH–, more related knowledge could be found from OER. It was found that AMOH bond length increases in the order of LiOH < NaOH < KOH < CsOH, and the alkalinity increases with AM radius. LiOH hydroxide with the largest hydration energy of Li+, is non-completely ionized and donates much less OH– than other AM hydroxides. The number of associated water molecules within it is the least in the four hydroxides, and therefore Li-water cluster should bind with OH weakly. As a result, OH is more accessible for the electrolyte, thereby promoting the OER performance [122]. The impact of cations on Had on a poly-Pt electrode has also been studied. The catalytic activity increases with the order of KOH < NaOH < LiOH, caused by less water molecules surrounding Li+, and the highly oriented water near Li+ could easily interact with the Had on catalyst by hydrogen bond and modify the Had and cause improvement in HER activities [123]. We also note that the cations in electrolyte might influence the stability of some electrodes. For the Ni-Mo cathode, NaOH, KOH and LiOH act differently both on its HER performance and the stability of Mo components. The transformation of MoO3 to MoO4 2− is more significant in NaOH than KOH and even less in LiOH solution, indicating a stability order of LiOH > KOH > NaOH. The different leaching degree of Mo is dependent on surface segregation of Mo in the present of changed cations [124]. The same group also suggests that during HER the cations such as K+ and Na+, are deposited onto the catalyst surface, although their affect on performance are not discussed. Moreover, the hydrated K+ in solution might be intercalated into the crystallographic structure of the layered materials such as LiIrO3 during OER [125]. It is informative for us to consider that if intercalation can also happen in alkaline HER process and cause the EDL change. Interestingly, the impurities in electrolyte can also improve the apparent HER performance. For example, by CV test it is found that trace Fe impurities from NaOH and CsOH rise the HER activities of Cu electrode by a factor of 5 [126]. While without those impurities, the CV curve shows ignorable dependence of electrolyte cations. This research suggests that the effect of Fe is even heavier than that of Cs+ or Na+. 2.2.4 H2 At the end of HER, hydrogen bubbles are formed on cathode surface, which further raise the overpotential of HER. The gas bubbles adhering to the electrode surface may prevent the charge/ion transfer between electrode and electrolyte, and the bubbles have to grow to a sufficient large size so as to leave the surface (Fig. 9 a) [127]. For HER at large current density, mass transfer should be considered for practical applications [128]. Liu et al. suggested Δη/Δlog|j| could act as an indicator to evaluate the performance of catalysts, despite of the Tafel slope when at high current density, at which situation that mass transfer limit the reaction kinetics (Fig. 9b,c) [33]. To minimize the negative impact of interfacial gas bubbles, several methods are developed. Creating hydrophilic surface will lead to a higher superaerophobicity, and therefore a faster H2 transfer, as suggested by the solid-liquid-gas interface theory. It indicates that the micro- and nano-scale roughness is efficient structure to pump up liquid, and could release the adhesion force for bubbles to release [129]. Jiang group used nanostructured MoS2 film as a typical instance, and illustrated that a superaerophobic surface of gas-releasing catalytic material can reduce the adhesion of produced bubbles of the electrode surface by an order of magnitude than its non-superarerophobic counterparts [130]. Ni-Mo alloy nanosheets, attributing to the ultrathin two-dimensional morphology, perform better than Pt/C catalyst benefiting to its faster electron/mass transfer [131]. By quantitatively measuring the contact angle and adhesion force, they evidenced that surface roughening benefit the HER through facilitating the detaching of bubbles to the electrode surface to reach rapid desorption of H2 [132]. Pine-like nanostructured Pt electrode exhibits a reduced adhesive force with a larger bubble contact angle in aqueous solution compared with flat one. Nanoarray structuring also leads to a facile bubble releasing step for N-doped WC [133]. Notably, only considering the contact of bubbles and electrodes at micro- and nanoscale is not enough, as their interaction at atomic level is also important. Liu et al. used Mo2C with high wettability to modify the surface of MoS2 catalyst, and therefore better liquid and gas transfer at MoS2/Mo2C catalyst surface were obtained, which lead to an enhanced HER performance under large current. They also emphasized the role of atomic-level interaction between the catalyst and the H2 for HER performance [33]. It is also suggested that hydrophilicity could lead to aerophobicity for electrode materials [33]. Therefore, the functional group listed in Table 1, as well as those mentioned in Section 2.1.1 (i.e. –O [29], –OH [20,23], CO and CO in CO3 2− [30], –F, –Cl), are also applicable for improving gas evolution rate. Other methods to exploit bubbles for enhancing HER include the change of electrolyte composition, surface passivation and applying flow fields, magnetic fields, acoustic fields, et al., which are comprehensively summarized in a recent review [127]. Furthermore, for H2 adsorption, some groups found that it competes with H2O adsorption at low Had coverage, thus leading to effective attraction between Had adsorbates [134]. Not only in HER, Li group also claimed that O2 transport efficiency needs to be quantified at high current densities for OER [135]. 2.2.5 Interfacial interactions of the species for alkaline HER After listing the recent researches of the interfacial species involved in alkaline HER (H2O, H, OH/OH–, H2, cations), it should be noted that those impacting factors actually interact with each other to a great extent, and the whole reaction activity is determined by several interrelated factors. For a single-component catalyst, the catalytic active centers are limited in amount, and therefore the interfacial water molecules, H, OH*/OH–, specifically adsorbed cations and H2 are intrinsically in competition for the active sites. From the former examples, we list here some typical examples. Firstly, OH– competes with water when adsorbing on the surface, which could lead to slower HER rate [25]. While for OHad on catalyst, the polar functional group facilitates the water adsorption and dissociation steps. Inversely, the interfacial water molecules arranged at EDL could tune the feasibility of OH– transportation after water dissociation, as suggested by the pzfc theory [8,52]. The shuffling effect of interfacial water is suggested to be overcome by tuning either the catalyst or the electrolyte cations [70]. Moreover, the hydrogen binding energy is also reported to be affected by OH– or interfacial water [50,86] Differently, the H atoms adsorbed on top site of Pt crystal are found to link with the cation type in electrolyte. The apparent Hupd peak is likely the synergistic effect of H coverage, H-water, water-catalyst interactions and the electric field [62]. The interactions between interfacial water and cations are more obvious [106]. Li+ with higher hydration energy was added into Ni(OH)2 solution, which would lead to a complex of Ni(OH)2-Li+−OH-H, thereby promoting water dissociation by changing the interfacial water structure [106]. The acidity/alkalinity of cations also impacts the transformation from OHad to OH–. The cations could facilitate water polarization, which could anchor the hydrated water molecules onto catalyst surface under electric field force, and the polarized water with O pointed to cations and H to outside is also beneficial for water dissociation. We also note that superareophobilicity is highly related to hydrophilicity [33]. These interactions between the species in EDL are illustrated in Scheme 2 . We note here that the cation-cation interactions are also of great value for studying alkaline HER mechanisms. However, researches related to this topic are relatively rare in HER field. Therefore we introduce here an example from the field of OER which involves cation-cation interactions, for a better understanding of this topic. In Li’s research, when adding K+ to the NaOH electrolyte, the HER rate increases obviously. This is due to the larger ion size of K+ compared to Na+, which could interact with surface adsorbed OHad by a water molecule, instead of directly interacting as the case of Na+ [136]. The weakened cation−OHad bond and reduced Faradic effect are beneficial for the OH– transfer. In condition that the interfacial intermediates are highly interactive with each other, their interactions build up large barrier to determine that which part is the most important. Indeed, this difficulty is also the origin of the debates of several theories and also exactly one essential goal of alkaline catalysis, i.e., to unravel the mechanism underlying the reaction. Improvements of alkaline HER activities enhanced by adjusting species inside the EDL are listed in Table 2 for a better comparison."
4,EDL reconstruction during charging/discharging,"In the above chapter we have discussed the influence of the species inside EDL on the catalytic activities in detail. However, the catalyst itself under negative potential and harsh electrolyte condition may also suffer from phase change or oxidation-state variation during the test, which would lead to surface reconstruction [140], EDL charging/discharging [141] and gas accumulation [4,135]. Therefore, dynamically understanding the corresponding changes of EDL is also of great importance. Till now, applying in-situ/operando platforms to HER catalysts has not as actively attempted as to OER or CO2RR, and only few literatures were found to report the EDL variation during alkaline HER. Nathan S. Lewis found that CoP in acidic HER turns into amorphous phase which consists of near-zarovalent Co and reduced P predominantly [142]. CoSe2 also undergoes a reduction reaction into metallic Co with the help of P doping in alkaline HER [143]. NiPt3@NiS catalyst undergoes a leaching of S and Ni during alkaline HER, and NiS partially hydroxylates to Ni(OH) [144]. NiSe2 is found to decompose into NiSe during alkaline HER [145]. Expect for the reduction of catalysts, other phenomenon are also observed during alkaline HER. For instance, H protons are proved to intercalate into MoS2 layers during HER [146]. Wei et al. identified the dynamical evolution of Co single-atom catalyst during HER, from HO–Co1–N2 to H2O–(HO–Co1–N2) state in alkaline HER [147]. Those changes in catalysts themselves will undoulbtly influence the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates inside the EDL, and then change their performance. More direct relationship between EDL reconstruction and performance is rarely reported for HER. Recently, Ajayan group assembled a two-electrode capacitor to measure the strength of the EDL, and found that the HER activity is inversely in dependence of the EDL strength [148]. Hydrogen adsorption/desorption energy determined from DFT calculations is also inversely related to the supercapacitance. Although rarely studied in alkaline HER, fortunately, pioneer research works for OER and CO2RR offer us a train of thought to study the dynamic evolution of EDL during catalytic process. Li group firstly reported an abnormal OER performance for NiCo2O3 in alkaline electrolyte, of which the OER activity decreases with enhanced scan rate [141]. They explained that the reconstruction of the EDL microstructure happens during the continuous OER process and the reconstruction depends on potential scan rate. As illustrated in Fig. 10 , the electric field induced an EDL near the electrode. When the electrode is charged, non-Faradic adsorption of OH– on positive catalyst layer happens, causing EDL reconstruction during OER. The conception of accessible EDL should also be introduced to highlight the barrier caused by mass transfer of OH– and O2 in the reaction. EDL reconstruction is a comprehensive process by complicated interactions of all species inside EDL. When scan rate is enhanced, the EDL is highly covered by O2, causing poor electrical conduction and catalyst oxidation, which synergistically lead to the reduced activity compared with that at low scan rate. Another article suggests that EDL charging reduces the local pH at the reaction plane and in turn changes the RDS for CO2RR from *COOH formation to CO2 adsorption [149]. Essentially, for reactions involving partial electron transfer between electrode and electrolyte species, a strong dipole moment is formed, which highly depends on the charging situations of the EDL. Moreover, they suggest that these strategies including introducing co-adsorption of ions on catalyst surface, adding impurities into electrolytes, adjusting the kind of cations in electrolyte, or applying an external field via a field effect transistor, can modify the structure of EDL."
5,Methods for detecting the interfacial species,"Above examples have fully suggested that the nature of EDL tremendously influences the HER process encountered at the electrode-electrolyte interface. However, the precise characterizations for EDL are still challenging, considering the low concentration of intermediates and the present of electrolyte and applied bias during reaction, as mentioned before. Despite the difficulties, researchers have devoted to exploring various in-situ techniques to investigate the physical properties of intermediates (here refer to water molecules, Had, OHad, OH– and H2) as well as cations inside the EDL. We will focus on the detection of intermediates in EDL as they specifically exist in alkaline HER. Electrochemical methods, such as CV, CO displacement, spectroscopy methods (XAS, Raman, FTIR, AP-XPS, sum frequency spectroscopy, X-ray scattering), and other techniques such as laser-induced temperate jump method, gas-phase contact angle and adhesion force are applied by researchers to study the water reorganization, H, OH, OH– adsorption as well as H2 desorption during alkaline HER process. The laser-induced temperature-jump method is used to determine the potential of maximum entropy (pme) of electrode under aqueous solution [150]. The temperature of interfacial water can be effected by the short laser rapidly, and the temperature perturbation leads to a temporal potential change. By evaluating the transiently polarity change of the potential, we can obtain the potential of maximum entropy (pme) at which the polarity changes, and predict the pzfc of a catalyst. The reason that the interfacial potential response to the temperature disturb is that, close to the surface, it is observed that the water network re-organizes after the laser pulse. When the potential is lower than the pzfc, water molecules tend to point the hydrogens facing the surface. At ( ∂ E ∂ T ) q , θ = 0 (where the pme locates), the water orientation becomes balanced (Fig. 11 a-d) [151]. Experimentally, the laser-induced temperature-jump method shows that nickel-doped Pt could disturb the water network at the interphase. This is an evidence that implicates the relevance between the interfacial water and HER performance [52]. Ni(OH)2 anchoring on Pt(111) is also observed to shift the pme/pzfc closer to the H adsorption region [8]. This technique has also been applied to measure the effect of pH on the Pt step and terrace sites [152]. CO displacement is also an effective method to measure the pztc of platinum electrodes [68]. The CO displacement charge plot can be read when its value crosses the line y = 0 [68]. One disadvantage of this method is that the potential range of CO displacement is limited. The upper potential is the onset of CO oxidation potential and the lower limit is the HER potential. Fig. 11e plots the CO displacement charge against potential Pt(111), Ru(OH)x-doped and Ni(OH)x-doped Pt(111) [68]. CO displacement experiment presents that with Ni(OH)2 doping on Pt(111), the potential of zero total charge (pztc) move to less positive potentials, which is believed to link with the HER performance (Fig. 11f) [52]. Infrared (IR)-visible sum frequency generation (SFG) has been developed to measure Raman and IR vibrations on catalyst surface. This method is capable for probing the structure of the surface region [153]. Unlike electrochemical IR spectroscopy or SERS, SFG does not need to measure under a background substrate or well-designed metal surfaces, but a planar electrode is enough for it [154]. We can obtain the information of interfacial water, OH, and specifically adsorbed cations on the electrode, by analyzing the spectral response for hydrogen bonding strength [155]. CV tests, as an intrinsically in-situ method, enable the determination of surface coverage by the H and OH species. CV curves can indicate the adsorption of Hopd (negative to 0 V), the Hupd (0−0.4 V), as well as the OHad (0.6−0.8 V).Water molecules can also be absorbed at the whole potential range (Fig. 12 a) [156]. However the discussion of the significance of the CV peaks is also on debate; [16] some reports suggested that the Hupd peak is not due to H adsorption but also OH/H competition in alkaline environment (Fig. 12b) [86]. Moreover, CV method is also applicable to reflect the OH adsorption/desorption ability of catalysts [116]. For OH detection on Pt, CO displacement is another effective method: TM0/TM(OH)x−OHad + Pt−COad ↔ TM0/TM(OH)x + Pt−COOHad. Transition metals, i.e. Ni and Cu, pushes the CO stripping peak for Pt surface to lower potentials, which means that the TMs doping facilitate earlier OH– adsorption compared with bare Pt electrode and better HER performances (Fig. 12c,d) [17]. Although these electrochemical methods have been widely used, they seem to be indirect ways to predict the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) that is element-specific and local structure/chemical environment-sensitive, could provide us information about the electronic state as well as nearby atomic environment of the detected element [157]. For the aim of analyzing the interfacial water structure, studying the oxygen K-edge spectra is an effective method. It is worth noting that there is a total fluorescence yield (TEY) mode that is surface sensitive, which could detect the electrons at order of nanometers. Salmeron et al. used XAS to probe the interfacial water structure on gold surface in dependence of the applied bias, and illustrated that the orientation of interfacial water molecules differs from that in the bulk [9]. The adsorption behavior of ions at electrode/electrolyte interface can also be reflected by determining the elements of catalysts. Wei et al. applied operando XAS to Co single atom catalyst (schemed in Fig. 13 a), and found that the Co1–N4 configuration could react with the hydroxide in solution to form a high-valence HO–Co1–N2 structure. Water tends to adsorb on the moiety to form an intermediate H2O–(HO–Co1–N2) (Fig. 13b,c) [147]. Operando XAS for np-Cu53Ru47 revealed Ru sites as the water adsorption and dissociation [158] Jia et al. applied operando XAS systematically at the EDL of Pt-M nanocatalysts during the HER/HOR operation [115,118]. The OHads and H2Oads on surface M sites were observed to be the H-up configuration. The mechanism of OHads anchored on metal to promote HER is regarded to be the HSAB theory [115,118]. XANES technique also enables the detection of oxygen coverage that changes with potentials on Pt [158]. Raman spectroscopies are highly advantaged to reveal the fingerprint vibrational signatures of adsorbed species, such as interfacial water [159], H [160], OH [161], et al. even during reactions. By now, coordinated water with tetrahedral, trihedral configuration, surface specifically adsorbed water, hydrophobic water and et. al. at metal/water interfaces have been unraveled with the aid of various vibrational spectroscopy techniques [84]. An interesting result coming from in-situ Raman spectroscopy data is that although hydronium is rarely detected in alkaline electrolyte, it is found that with the water cleavage and hydrogen adsorption, massive H3O+ intermediates are generated on the electrode surface [162]. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy can also be used to obtain information about adsorption process for interfaces [163], yet it is limited by the poor knowledge of vibration examples of catalyst-H or catalyst−OH. Koper et al. performed in-situ FTIR spectroscopy during CV tests and found water adsorbed on gold-acetonitrile interface. [164] Feliu et al. found by in-situ FTIR that with the nickel doping on Pt, the adsorption potential of phosphate becomes higher [67]. Ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) [165] and surface X-ray scattering [166] can also reflect the interfacial adsorbed molecules/ions at a relative friendly environment. For H2 adsorption evaluation, indirect methods such as gas-phase contact angle and adhesion force are often used as mentioned in 2.2.4 [132,133]."
6,Conclusions and perspectives,"We conclude this review by suggesting a few key problems that should be focused to push future investigations. The alkaline HER dominates water electrolysis, and is regarded as a key step in the chlor-alkali process. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics compared with its acid-operating counterparts should be addressed. However, the argument of intrinsic mechanism for alkaline HER is still not settled. The viewpoint of HBE theory is that Happ is the sole descriptor of alkaline HER and the Happ is determined mainly by the interfacial water; yet the bifunctional theory suggests that water dissociation causes the major of energy consume for alkaline HER, and therefore the OH adsorption energy is important. Tang et al., however, are against the bifunctional theory and suggest that adsorbed hydroxyl participate in HER in an indirect way, which might stabilize a transition state or change the interfacial water orientation. Besides, the pzfc theory also suggests that difficult interfacial water reorganization that influences H/OH transfer inside EDL accounts for the sluggish HER in alkaline solution. Recently, the transfer of OHad at the surface to OH– to the bulk electrolyte is also considered to be a descriptor for alkaline HER. These views are all supported by experimental/theoretical results. It is difficult to identify one as universal rule for alkaline HER. However, we believe that a more solid electrochemistry foundation, as well as insights into the experimental methods, is the key to analyze which theory is more reliable. Several suggestions are listed below. Firstly, a multi-dimension descriptor should be introduced to depict the alkaline HER catalysts, because the main products in EDL of water dissociation, H and OH, simultaneously affecting the HER performance of the catalyst. As put forward by Koper et al. in their very recent research, a 3D-volcano plot is advanced to evaluate the rate-determining step for various catalysts [110]. By simply calculating the Gibbs free energies of Had and OHad, one could easily find the most suitable way to modify the catalysts. However, it is unfortunate that only limited catalysts (mainly focused on rare metals such as Pt, Au) are studied by Koper et al. and the 3D volcano plot can only show a rough trend. We suggest in this review that researchers focused on alkaline HER to provide DFT calculation data and/or experimental proofs of the ΔGH and ΔGOH values for catalysts, in which way the 3D volcano plot can be further completed. Secondly, in the EDL, the role of interfacial water has not been described in most of the published articles. Indeed, as the richest component in EDL, the water network inside EDL should be targeted for it indirectly impact the alkaline HER. On the face of it, the study of interfacial water seems difficult; Luckily, Tian et al. have presented an instructive work for us to accurately be aware of the interfacial water orientations by a comprehensively method concluding in-situ Raman with QMMD calculations [7]. Moreover, other in-situ methods such as FTIR, XAS, as well as laser-induced temperature jump methods, CO stripping, voltammetry, and impendence spectroscopy can also be applied to evaluate the interfacial directly or indirectly (by inferring the pzfc values). Thirdly, as the main by-product of alkaline HER, OH that adsorbs on the electrode surface would accept an electron to form OH− and pass through the EDL to the bulk. The accumulation of OH− is also reported to oxidize the catalysts. The hydroxyl transfer process, formulated as OHad + e− → OH−, can be comprehensively evaluated through combined methods of Zeta potential, CO stripping, CV curve at OH adsorption region, as well as DFT calculations, as suggested in our previous work [116,157]. However, to what extend that the OH− transfer influencing the HER kinetics should be further evaluated by Hamiltonian model framework. Fourthly, considering the application of alkaline HER in the industry, the affection of bubbles in EDL should not be ignored. Advances in promoting bubble transport at large current density can be achieved by the application of well-structured electrodes and hydrophilic catalysts. Through the optimization of gas channel with artificially designed flow fields, the maximum exposure of catalysts to gas and electrolytes can be attained. Fifthly, the mechanism studies for alkaline HER focus more on single crystal platinum electrodes, rather than nanomaterials that are more frequently used in practice. The gap between single crystal Pt and abundant nano-sized materials should not be ignored, as Qiao et al. found that nanostructured electrocatalysts, different from single crystal Pt, were observed to display anomalously high activity under high-pH conditions [167]. Therefore, we argue that more mechanism studies should be applied on nanocatalysts so as to obtain abundant samples for further analysis, and conversely to summarize a universal rule for them. Sixthly, for hybrid electrocatalysts, unavoidable charge transfer will happen between the intimately connected materials due to spontaneously Fermi level equilibration. The electron redistribution on both materials should not be ignored when evaluating the promoting effects of hybridized catalysts. For example, for a composite with better performance, of great importance is to evaluate which is more crucial for the performance enhancement, bifunctional mechanism or the change of HBE arising from electron redistribution. Actually, this is hard to tell apart. Therefore, designing model catalysts with similar ΔGH is important to study the bifunctional mechanism for hybrids. Seventhly, as the in-situ techniques have been greatly advanced in recent years, simultaneously using multiple kinds of techniques would help further reveal the catalytic process in EDL of HER, therefore comprehensively evaluating which theory is more suitable for specific systems. Directly observing the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates on catalysts gives straight evidences of the role of each component in hybridized catalysts. Eighthly, advanced simulation techniques such as the ab initio molecular dynamics, computational standard hydrogen electrode should be developed. Not only the relative adsorption energies of reaction intermediates could be calculated, but also the orientation of water molecules at the interface can be presented. The impact of specifically adsorbed cations coming from electrolyte, as well as the shape of the EDL is also accessible. Theoretical calculation is a powerful tool for us to understand the underlying mechanisms of alkaline HER. Lastly, we notice that the evolution of catalysts during electrochemical reaction in OER is more obvious due to the harsh environment, and therefore the reconstruction of EDL is more often focused in OER rather than in HER. In this case, it is important to push the knowledge in OER to the field of HER, such as EDL reconstruction, cation intercalation during reaction, impurity affection for catalysts, et al. Some techniques widely used in OER or CO2RR, such as EDL charging/discharging CV curves and kinetic mechanism-coupled DFT calculations, are constructive for HER study [136]. On the other hand, as an integral part of electrochemical water splitting cell, the sluggish kinetics of OER should not be underestimated [168]. To solve the problems in more complex OER counterpart, thoroughly understanding the mechanism underlying in the simplest HER process is beneficial for directing the mechanism study of OER."
