0,Introduction,"An air turbo-ramjet (ATR) engine is a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) engine and considered for future spaceplane or hypersonic vehicle application. The ATR engine has greater specific thrust than turbojet engines and higher specific impulse (Isp) than rocket engines. Thus, it is suitable for a propulsion engine of a hypersonic vehicle or a missile [1–3]. Different from the turbojet engine, propellant gas of the ATR engine is utilized for turbine driving gas. A gas generator (GG, Gas generator cycle ATR Engine, GG-ATR) or a heat exchanger (ATREX engine, [4]) can provide enthalpy for turbine work. For bipropellant GG-ATR engine, not only fuel but also oxidizer must be on-board, resulting in lower specific impulse (Isp). However, the GG-ATR engine can be expected to be lighter than the ATREX engine because the GG can be designed to be more compact than the heat exchanger. The author considers that the GG-ATR engine is the propulsion engine for the supersonic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is now under development in Muroran Institute of Technology [5]. Fig. 1 and 2 show the GG-ATR engine developed at Muroran Institute of Technology and the conceptual schematic of the GG-ATR engine, respectively. High-temperature, fuel-riched GG combustion gas can drive a turbine and a compressor. The compressor increases the incoming air pressure. GG combustion gas mixes with the air and burns at a ram combustor after driving the turbine. This ram combustor temperature will be higher than the afterburner temperature for the turbojet engine. Thus, greater thrust is obtainable for GG-ATR engine. In the previous studies, many researchers investigated GG-ATR engine performance analytically and experimentally. Most of those studies focused on liquefied hydrogen (LH2) fuel with liquefied oxygen (LOX) [1]. LH2 is one of the most promising fuels because of its high specific heat release and large cooling capability. However, the density of LH2 is only one-tenth of that of kerosene and a large volume of a fuel tank is required, which induces greater aerodynamic drag. Low-density characteristics of LH2 cause a significant drawback to an atmospheric flight vehicle. Besides of LH2 fuel, Sullerey et al. compared LH2 with propane fuel for GG-ATR engine application [6]. Lilly et al. conducted the ground test of the GG-ATR engine with hydrazine [7]. Hydrazine or its derivatives can be utilized as monopropellant by its exothermic decomposition. Hydrocarbon fuels are also expected for promising fuel of GG-ATR engine because they have large density and are easy handling. Hydrocarbon compounds, which have only single bonds, are categorized into alkanes. Those compounds are often called the saturated hydrocarbon or paraffin. Besides cycloalkanes, a general formula of the saturated straight-chain alkane is represented as CnH2n+2. For GG-ATR engine application, the ratio of hydrogen atoms number to carbon atoms number in fuel molecule (H/C ratio) is preferable to be larger, because molecular weight of Gas Generator (GG) combustion gas can be reduced, resulting of higher Isp. With the same carbon atoms number, alkanes have more hydrogen atoms than alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes or aromatic compounds. Lower molecular weight alkanes have larger hydrogen atoms/carbon atoms ratio (H/C ratio). For example, H/C ratios of methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) are 4 and 3, respectively. However, boiling temperatures of lower alkane than normal-pentane (n-C5H12) are generally lower than room temperature. Those alkanes have to be stored at cryogenic state in a fuel tank. Moreover, the densities of liquefied those alkanes are smaller than aviation kerosene. Low density and cryogenic properties induce handling difficulties and require a large volume of the fuel tank, resulting in disadvantages for atmospheric flight. On the other hand, alcohol is the chemical compound, which has hydroxyl group to saturated alkane species. From the viewpoint of organic chemistry, alcohol can be considered the organic derivatives of water, whose one of the hydrogen atoms is replaced by an alkyl group. Hydroxyl group of alcohol has a similar structure to water. Because of this characteristic, alcohol has higher boiling temperature and lower heat release than alkane. For example, the boiling temperature of methanol and ethanol are 337.8 K and 351.5 K, respectively. However, specific impulse (Isp) of an aerospace propulsion engine is usually proportional to the heat release of fuel. Thus, alcohol fuels have scarcely used for aerospace propulsion fuels except for some rocket fuel applications. The heat release of ethanol is only two-thirds of that of aviation kerosene. On the other hand, soot formation in GG can be expected to be less than kerosene fuels. Moreover, the author clarified that Isp of GG-ATR engine with ethanol is superior to that with kerosene [8]. This result indicated that the ethanol has the feasibility for the GG-ATR engine [5]. Isp of GG-ATR engine is affected by the molecular weight of GG combustion gas rather than specific heat release of the fuel. GG combustion gas of LOX-ethanol has lower molecular weight than that of LOX-normal dodecane (n-C12H26) because ethanol has a higher H/C ratio than n-C12H26. The lower molecular weight of GG combustion gas is, the higher specific turbine power is available. That is the reason why ethanol has a higher Isp than n-C12H26. However, it is still unknown whether ethanol has the superiority to lower alkanes, such as methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6) and propane (C3H8). The aim of the present study focuses on the feasibility of alcohol fuel for GG-ATR engine application. The present study treats from C1 (CH4 and CH3OH) to C4 (n-C4H10 and 1-C4H9OH) species. With LOX oxidizer, GG-ATR engine performances for alcohol fuel analytically evaluated and compared to those for alkane fuel."
1,Analytical methods and condition,
2,GG-ATR engine analytical method,"2.1 GG-ATR engine analytical method The specific thrust is defined as thrust per unit airflow rate. The Isp is thrust per unit propellant flow rate. Those are fundamental parameters to evaluate air-breathing engine performance. Equations (1) and (2) represent the specific thrust and the Isp of the GG-ATR engine, respectively, (1) F m ˙ air = 1 g ( 1 + f ) 2 C P , ram T T , ram ( 1 − ( P nozzle P T , nozzle ) γ nozzle − 1 γ nozzle ) − V g + ( P nozzle − P a t m ) A nozzle m ˙ air g (2) I SP = 1 g ( 1 + 1 f ) 2 C P , ram T T , ram ( 1 − ( P nozzle P T , nozzle ) γ nozzle − 1 γ nozzle ) − V f g + ( P nozzle − P a t m ) A nozzle m ˙ air f g where f is the Propellant-to-Air Ratio (PAR) and defined as equation (3). (3) f = m ˙ GG m ˙ air = C P , A i r T T , A i r ( π comp γ − 1 γ − 1 ) η comp η turb C P , GG T GG ( 1 − π turb γ GG − 1 γ GG ) PAR in equation (3) can be derived from compressor-turbine power balance and corresponds to Fuel-to-Air Ratio of a turbojet engine. Different from the turbojet engine, estimation of Isp and PAR must include consideration for a mass flow rate of oxidizer. Thus, the author refers f as Propellant-to-Air Ratio to avoid the confusion. As shown in Eq. (2), PAR can affect significantly on the Isp of the GG-ATR engine. GG-ATR engine performance analysis considers turbomachinery characteristics in conjunction with chemical equilibrium calculation. Especially, chemical equilibrium calculation is necessary for combustion at GG and a ram combustor in GG-ATR engine. The author developed Gas generator cycle-Air Turbo Ramjet Engine Analysis Code (GATRAC), which contains chemical equilibrium analysis. Comparing with NASA-CEA [9], the author validated the accuracy of the chemical equilibrium calculation in GATRAC thoroughly. GATRAC can analytically obtain thrust and Isp of GG-ATR engine in a given altitude and flight Mach number and is capable of treating on/off-design performance analysis. Moreover, GATRAC can also calculate total pressure and total temperature at GG-ATR engine components. The computational procedure for GATRAC is the same one with reference [8], and its summary is described as follows. 1. GG-ATR engine parameters in on-design condition are given from the input data. Those parameters contain pressure/heat loss coefficients at each engine components, compressor pressure ratio, π comp , corrected airflow rate, m air,COR , turbine expansion ratio, π turb , GG combustion pressure, P T , GG , and temperature, T T , GG , and so on. 2. Atmospheric pressure and temperature are given as functions of altitude [10]. Total pressure and temperature at compressor inlet are calculated from altitude, flight Mach number, and pressure loss at an air intake duct. The intake pressure loss for supersonic flight is estimated by MIL-E-5008B [11]. 3. Based on the assumption that a velocity diagram can keep its similarity during turbomachinery operation, corrected air flow rate, m air,COR , is considered to be linearly proportional to corrected rotational speed, N COR . The specific compression work (Compression work per unit airflow rate) is proportional to the square of N COR [12], (4) m ˙ air ∝ N COR , ( π comp ) γ − 1 γ − 1 ∝ N COR 2 If N COR is specified, m COR and π comp can be determined. The compressor exit static pressure, P S , comp , out , can also be calculated by π comp . 4. Chemical equilibrium calculation is conducted at the GG in on-design condition. Oxidizer-to-Fuel (O/F) ratio at the GG is determined to set T T , GG , to a specified value. The obtained O/F ratio is constant in off-design condition analysis. 5. Turbine adiabatic efficiency is given as a function of velocity ratio, U/ C 0 , where U and C 0 are circumferential velocity of a turbine rotor and gas spouting velocity from a turbine nozzle, respectively [13]. Gas flow is usually choked flow at the turbine nozzle. Thus, the following formulas are derived, (5) m ˙ GG C GG ⁎ ( m ˙ GG C GG ⁎ ) d e = P T , GG P T , GG , d e (6) C GG ⁎ = R GG T T , GG γ GG ( γ GG + 1 2 ) γ GG + 1 γ GG − 1 C GG ⁎ in equation (6) is referred to as the characteristic velocity at the turbine nozzle. The iterative procedure is employed to obtain GG combustion pressure, P T , GG from eq. (3), (5), and (6). The initial value of P T , GG is assumed at first. m GG can be given from eq. (5). P T , GG and the turbine exit static pressure, P S , turb , out , can determine the turbine expansion ratio, π turb . P S , turb , out is equal to the compressor exit static pressure, P S , comp , out . By using π turb , P T , GG is revised by the correlation between m air and m GG in eq. (3). 6. P T , GG is calculated iteratively until the relative difference of P T , GG is converged to be less than 10−5. 7. Total pressure and mixture ratio at ram combustor can be given from π comp and PAR, respectively. The ram combustor temperature can be calculated under those conditions. Finally, the exhaust gas velocity from the nozzle can be determined. The turbine expansion process is treated as chemical frozen flow, because of simplicity. Christensen indicated that analytical result in frozen flow condition at a turbine is identical to those in the chemical equilibrium condition [14]. Sullerey et al. also employed the chemical frozen flow assumption for the GG-ATR engine analysis and could obtain reasonable results [6]."
3,Alcohol and alkane fuels properties,"2.2 Alcohol and alkane fuels properties In the present study, CH4, C2H6, C3H8 and 1-C4H10 are selected as alkane fuels of GG-ATR engine performance analyses. On the other hand, methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (C2H5OH), 1-propanol (1-C3H7OH), and 1-butanol (1-C4H9OH) are selected for alcohol fuels. Table 1 indicates the physical and the chemical properties of those alcohols and alkanes, which are referred from the database of NIST [15]. In general, alkanes have more specific heat release and less specific heat capacity than alcohols if those have the same number of carbon atoms. The isomers are compounds that have the same numbers and kinds of atoms but different structure. The present analysis treats straight-chain alkanes and primary alcohols because of the simplification of analytical conditions. Among alcohols and alkanes in Table 1, C4H10 and C3H7OH have two isomers individually, and C4H9OH has four isomers. Differences of GG combustion gas characteristics among isomers depend on their heat release. For C4H10 and C3H7OH isomers, differences of specific heat release among them are less than 1.0%. For butanol isomers, the maximum difference for the heat release is 1.27% between 1-C4H9OH and tert-C4H9OH. The engine performance differences among those isomers are discussed in the later. The present study focuses on the effects of the carbon atoms number in fuel molecules and the differences between alkanes and alcohols. Performance of a GG-ATR engine depends on temperature and molecular weight of GG combustion gas [8]. GG combustion gas temperature, T T , GG , is usually restricted by a thermal limitation of a turbine blade. Oxidizer-to-Fuel (O/F) ratio at GG is determined to set T T , GG to a specified value. If fuel, oxidizer and its O/F ratio are specified, T T , GG and chemical composition of GG combustion gas can be determined. The chemical composition of GG combustion gas can determine the molecular weight and the specific heat ratio of GG combustion gas. Those results are necessary to evaluate turbine power."
4,Analytical condition of GG-ATR engine performance,"2.3 Analytical condition of GG-ATR engine performance Table 2 lists the analytical parameters for GG-ATR engine components. Pressure loss coefficients at each engine components are defined as the ratio of outlet to inlet total pressure. On the other hands, heat loss coefficients are the ratio of outlet to inlet total temperature at the engine components. For example, pressure and heat loss coefficients at a ram combustor, π ram , and τ ram , are represented as equation (7), (7) τ ram = T T , ram , out T T , ram , i n , π ram = P T , ram , out P T , ram , i n The parameters in Table 2 are based on those of the GG-ATR engine developed at Muroran Institute of Technology. Adiabatic compression efficiency, η comp , is given as 78% in on-design condition. Turbine adiabatic efficiency, η turb , is determined by a velocity ratio, U/ C 0 , as described in the previous section. The typical value of total-to-total, η turb , is about 70% in on-design condition. In the present study, the author conducts the parametric studies concerned with T T , GG , and compressor pressure ratio, π comp . As mentioned previously, T T , GG is the most crucial parameter for the GG-ATR engine because its turbine power is proportional to it. Moreover, a thermal limitation of a turbine blade strictly restricts T T , GG . Practical T T , GG must be less than 1100 K. The author analytically evaluates specific thrust and Isp as functions of T T , GG , which is ranged from 900 K to 1400 K with a temperature increment of 50 K. The compressor pressure ratio, π comp , for the GG-ATR engine in Muroran Institute of Technology is equal to 2.5 in on-design condition. In the present study, four values of π comp are selected as 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 4.0 to investigate its effect on the engine performances. Turbine expansion ratio, π turb , is considered to be constant regardless of π comp . Therefore, GG combustion pressure, P T , GG , should vary depending on π comp because turbine exit pressure, P T , turb , out , must be larger than the ram combustor pressure, P T , ram . As well as P T , GG , nozzle expansion ratio, ε, should also vary with π comp because π comp can affect static pressure at a nozzle exit, P nozzle . The present analysis eliminates the effects of pressure difference on the nozzle exit from the influences of π comp on specific thrust and Isp. Based on the above, P T , GG and ε are listed in Table 3 . The values of ε in Table 3 give the static pressure at the nozzle exit as about 40 kPa in sea level static condition. If the nozzle exit pressure is lower than this pressure level, flow separation will occur within a nozzle. Moreover, for ε in Table 3, the nozzle flow will be optimum expansion when flight Mach number and altitude are 1.3 and 11 km, respectively, which correspond to typical transonic flight condition."
5,Code validation with experimental data,"2.4 Code validation with experimental data The author has already confirmed the accuracy of GATRAC in reference [8] in comparison with the experimental data. However, the present paper describes those results of the code validation of GATRAC [8]. For code validation, the author utilizes the experimental data in reference [7], where Lilly et al. tested the hydrazine-fueled GG-ATR engine. In their tests, they conducted the GG-ATR engine tests for five different engine configurations. The original engine was called Build 1. The latest one was Build 5, which employs the improved ram combustor mixer. The rotational speed of their GG-ATR engine is 68000 rpm in on-design condition. The analytical results by the present code are compared with the experimental data in the range from 40000 to 68000 rpm, where the specific rotational speed, N S , corresponds from 0.588 to 1.0. Fig. 3 indicates the comparison between the analytical and the experimental thrust and Isp of the hydrazine-fueled GG-ATR engine. The engine performance parameters are described in ref. [7], although the ram combustor pressure recovery, π ram , is not mentioned. If π ram is equal to 0.88, the analytical predictions of thrust and Isp show good agreement with the experimental results. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between the analytical prediction and the experimental result for the ram combustor temperature, T T , ram . This figure also indicates that the analytical predictions agree well with the experimental data. The results in the code validation imply the reliability of GATRAC for the GG-ATR engine analyses."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Specific thrust, Isp and ram combustor temperature","3.1 Specific thrust, Isp and ram combustor temperature In general, a GG-ATR engine has higher specific thrust than turbojet engine because of its high exhaust gas temperature. The typical specific thrust of an air-breathing engine is about 100 kgf/(kg/s) at the maximum. Fig. 5 shows the specific thrusts of the GG-ATR engine for four alkanes and four alcohols as functions of T T , GG . π comp in Fig. 5 are 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0. The results in Fig. 5 are the ones in the Sea Level Static condition. In general, a larger π comp leads to a higher specific thrust. For all of those alkanes and alcohols, those specific thrusts have the maximum value about T T , GG . The peak T T , GG for the specific thrust moves to higher T T , GG condition as the number of carbon atoms in fuels increases. Moreover, the peak T T , GG for the specific thrusts of alcohols are less than those of alkanes. Alcohols have higher specific thrust than alkanes in lower T T , GG condition. This result indicates the advantage of alcohol over alkane in GG-ATR engine application because higher T T , GG cannot be acceptable. To explore the mechanism of these results, Fig. 6 shows the ram combustor temperature, T T , ram , for these fuels, as functions of T T , GG . The behaviors of T T , ram are very similar to those of specific thrust in Fig. 5. The peak T T , GG for T T , ram are a little higher than those for specific thrusts. Combustion in a ram combustor at those peak T T , GG corresponds to a stoichiometric condition. Thus, if T T , GG is lower than those peak ones, GG combustion gas burns under fuel rich condition in the ram combustor. Those peak T T , GG for specific thrust increase as π comp becomes higher. An increase of π comp means a growth of the compression work. Thus, higher T T , GG is necessary to keep a propellant-to-air ratio to stoichiometric one at the ram combustor, if π comp increases. Fig. 7 shows Isp of the GG-ATR engine for four alkanes and four alcohols with LOX oxidizer in Sea Level Static condition. For all those eight fuels, higher T T , GG leads to higher Isp. As indicated in eq. (3), higher T T , GG can decrease PAR, resulting in the improvement of Isp. In general, lower molecular weight alkane leads to higher Isp. The differences of Isp among those four alkanes grow in lower T T , GG condition, and those shrink in higher T T , GG . With those four alkanes, the increments of Isp with T T , GG show steep increase under lower T T , GG condition and turn to be moderate in higher T T , GG . Higher T T , GG is not realistic in the actual GG-ATR engine because of a thermal limitation of a turbine blade. Moreover, from the results in Figs. 5 and 6, too much higher T T , GG is not necessary for the GG-ATR engine application. The behaviors of Isp for alcohols are very contrastive to those for alkanes. For example, in the case of π comp = 2.5 and T T , GG less than 1050 K, less number of carbon atoms in alcohol molecules leads to higher Isp. The relationship between Isp and the number of carbon atoms in fuel molecule shows the same tendency for alkanes. However, this relationship turns to be opposite in higher T T , GG condition. Moreover, the more carbon atom number in alcohol molecule leads to the higher Isp. Fig. 7 indicates the significant advantage of alcohols to alkanes. For example, in the case of π comp = 2.5 , the lower molecular weight alcohol such as CH3OH or C2H5OH have larger Isp than C2H6 or C3H8 for T T , GG less than 1050 K. This advantage is prominent for higher π comp ."
8,GG combustion gas properties,"3.2 GG combustion gas properties PAR and ram combustor temperature, T T , ram , are the main parameters to influence on Isp, as indicated in eq. (2). Thus, PAR is analytically evaluated to investigate its effect on Isp. PAR is proportional to the molecular weight of GG combustion gas, M W , GG , as indicated in eq. (3). Fig. 8 shows the molecular weights of GG combustion gas for π comp = 2.5 , as functions of T T , GG . Higher π comp requires higher GG combustion pressure, P T , GG . However, the dependency of π comp on the molecular weight of GG combustion gas has scarcely appeared. Fig. 9 shows the PAR, as functions of T T , GG , for π comp = 2.5 . The dependency of π comp on PAR mainly comes from the numerator of eq. (3). Thus, the following relation can be derived, (8) f ∝ π comp ( γ − 1 ) / γ − 1 From eq. (8), the results of PAR for π comp = 2.0 , 3.0 and 4.0 are roughly equal to 0.72, 1.23 and 1.62 times of PAR for π comp = 2.5 , respectively. As indicated in Fig. 8, a smaller molecular weight of the GG combustion gas can be obtained for lower molecular weight alkane in all range from T T , GG = 900 K to 1400 K. The molecular weights of GG combustion gas for CH4 and C2H6 have the minimum values at T T , GG = 1200 K and 1350 K, respectively. On the other hands, the tendency of molecular weight of GG combustion gas for alcohols alters at T T , GG = 1200 K. Under this temperature, lower molecular weight alcohol has a smaller molecular weight of GG combustion gas. However, in T T , GG more than 1200 K condition, larger molecular weight alcohol has a slightly smaller molecular weight of GG combustion gas. For both alcohols and alkanes, the differences among molecular weight of GG combustion gas also shrink in higher T T , GG condition. PAR is inversely proportional to T T , GG as indicated in the eq. (3). PAR contains the molecular weight of GG combustion gas. Thus, PAR in Fig. 9 is greatly influenced by it. Therefore, PAR has some common characteristics with the molecular weight of GG combustion gas. Firstly, lower molecular weight alkane has a lower PAR. Secondary, the behaviors of PAR for alcohols alter at T T , GG = 1200 K. Lower molecular weight alcohols have lower PAR for T T , GG less than 1200 K. On the other hands, larger molecular weight alcohols have a slightly larger PAR for T T , GG more than 1200 K. Moreover, for all those fuels, PAR converges on the same level if T T , GG increases. For T T , GG less than 1100 K, in comparison of alcohols to alkanes with the same number of carbon, 1-C4H9OH has a lower PAR and molecular weight than 1-C4H10. However, PAR of CH3OH is higher than CH4, and that of C2H5OH is also higher than C2H6. The previous study made clear that lower PAR can contribute to higher Isp in comparison of C2H5OH with n-C12H26 [8]. However, the results in Fig. 9 cannot explain that Isp of alcohols is higher than those of alkanes. Higher Isp of alcohol arises from higher T T , ram as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 10 shows the equivalence ratios at GG as functions of T T , GG for π comp = 2.5 . In the range from T T , GG = 1000 to 1250 K, the equivalence ratios of those four alcohols are roughly equal to that of CH4 and less than the other three alkanes. The GG combustion gases of C2H6, C3H8 and 1-C4H10 burn under fuel-richer condition than those of alcohols in this T T , GG range. For T T , GG from 1300 K to 1400 K, the equivalence ratios of those four alkanes and four alcohols are all converged to about 3.0. Fig. 11 shows the chemical compositions of GG combustion gas for those alkane and alcohol fuels in the range of T T , GG from 900 K to 1400 K. The main chemical species in GG combustion gas are hydrogen (H2), CH4, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The amounts of other species are negligible. H2, CH4, and CO are combustible species, and CO2 and H2O are incombustible ones. In the chemical species in GG combustion gases, mole fractions of H2 and CH4 significantly contribute to the turbine power. High H2 mole fraction contributes to the reduction of the molecular weight of GG combustion gas. In lower T T , GG condition, H2 mole fractions are relatively small, and CH4 mole fractions are higher in GG combustion gas. This tendency is prominent for C3H8 and 1-C4H10. As T T , GG increases, H2 mole fraction also increases and CH4 is decreased. For T T , GG more than 1300 K, CH4 mole fraction is nearly equal to zero, and H2 mole fractions are about 40 to 50 percent. In such conditions, the main chemical species in GG combustion gases are H2, CO, and others. An increase of T T , GG means to reduce the equivalence ratio at the GG combustion. Thus, comparing alcohols and alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms, H2 mole fractions for alcohol are relatively higher than those for alkane for T T , GG less than 1100 K. The chemical compositions of GG combustion gases in Fig. 11 can explain T T , ram behaviors. The mole fractions of CO2 and H2O for alcohol fuel are generally higher than those for alkane. Those two are incombustible species and significantly affect T T , ram behaviors. For example, the sum of CO2 and H2O mole fractions in the GG combustion gas of C2H5OH is about 20% for T T , GG from 900 K to 1400 K. On the other hand, those are about 5% or less for C2H6 fueled GG combustion gas. Although PAR of C2H6 is less than that of C2H5OH, as indicated in Fig. 9, the ram combustion of C2H6 fuel for π comp = 2.5 and T T , GG = 1100 K is done under fuel rich condition because its peak T T , GG for T T , ram is equal to about 1200 K. The ram combustion of C2H5OH for those π comp and T T , GG is considered to be fortunately done under the stoichiometric condition because the peak T T , GG for T T , ram is about 1100 K. This higher T T , ram for C2H5OH can contribute to higher specific thrust and Isp than those of C2H6. Those tendencies are prominent in lower T T , GG conditions. As mentioned previously, lower T T , GG is preferable from the viewpoint of a thermal limitation of a turbine blade. In general, alcohol has a disadvantage of its low specific heat release. The previous study described that C2H5OH has an advantage to n-C12H26 in the GG-ATR engine application. The GG combustion gas of ethanol has a lower molecular weight and greater turbine specific work than n-C12H26. These results are caused by high H/C ratio of ethanol, resulting in lower PAR and larger Isp [8]. The results in the present study indicate that alcohol like CH3OH and C2H5OH have the superiority to not only n-C12H26, but also other alkanes like C2H6 and C3H8, especially in the case of lower T T , GG . This advantage is brought about by high T T , ram due to nearly stoichiometric ram combustion. The GG-ATR engine in Muroran Institute of Technology utilizes ethanol and LOX, as mentioned previously [5]. Thus, the utilization of C2H5OH for the GG-ATR engine is a reasonable option in comparison to aviation kerosene or C3H8."
9,Effects of isomers on GG-ATR engine performance,"3.3 Effects of isomers on GG-ATR engine performance The analyses in the previous sections investigate the GG-ATR engine performances for the fuels in Table 1. Among those fuels, 1-C4H10 and 1-C3H7OH have isomers of 2-C4H10 and 2-C3H7OH, respectively. 1-C4H9OH has isomers of 2-C4H9OH, iso-butanol (2-CH3-1-C3H7OH), and tert-butanol (2-CH3-2-C3H7OH). Differences of engine performance among those isomers are considered to arise from a difference of specific heat release among them. The maximum difference of heat release among those isomers is only 1.27%, which is between 1-C4H9OH and tert-C4H9OH. Thus, the present study focuses on the comparison of 1-C4H9OH and tert-C4H9OH for the GG-ATR engine application. However, the melting temperature of tert-C4H9OH is 298.8 K, and it tends to be a solid state at room temperature. Thus, it is almost impossible to utilize pure tert-C4H9OH for aviation fuel. It is used as a solvent in ethanol or fuel additives in gasoline. Fig. 12 shows the comparisons between 1-C4H9OH and tert-C4H9OH. Fig. 12a to 12c indicate specific thrusts, Isp and ram combustor temperature, T T , ram , respectively. In Fig. 12, compressor pressure ratio, π comp is 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0. T T , GG is ranged from 900 K to 1400 K. There are almost no differences in those results between them. The differences among isomers on GG-ATR engine performance is negligible."
10,GG-ATR engine performance along flight trajectory,"3.4 GG-ATR engine performance along flight trajectory The previous section treats the GG-ATR engine performance analyses in the sea level static condition. From the results in Fig. 5 and 7, the superiorities of alcohols to alkanes is prominent in lower T T , GG condition. Thus, the present section investigates the feasibility of alcohol fuels in the off-design condition. The off-design analysis is conducted along the flight trajectory as shown in Fig. 13 . This trajectory is the same one in reference [8]. A vehicle will take off at Mach 0.3, and travel along 25 kPa constant dynamic pressure trajectory for more than Mach 0.7. In the off-design analysis, π comp is equal to 2.5 and T T , GG are 1050 K and 1400 K. Fig. 14 and 15 indicate specific thrust and Isp along this trajectory, respectively. Comparing Fig. 5(b), Fig. 7(b) and Fig. 14, Fig. 15, the magnitude relations of specific thrust and Isp among those eight fuels do not change throughout this trajectory. Both specific thrust and Isp increase in high altitude/high Mach number conditions. Equation (9) defines the thermal efficiency of the GG-ATR engine. This definition is the same one in Ref. [8], (9) η t h = m ˙ A i r [ ( 1 + f ) V e x t 2 2 − V 2 2 ] m ˙ fuel h = 1 + r OF f h [ ( 1 + f ) V e x t 2 2 − V 2 2 ] where h is heat release of fuel. r OF in eq. (9) is the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio at a gas generator, and f is PAR defined in eq. (3). The thermal efficiency definition is similar to that of a turbojet engine. Fig. 16 indicates the thermal efficiencies of the GG-ATR engine along this trajectory. Those behaviors in Fig. 16 are entirely different from those of specific thrust and Isp. For both T T , GG = 1050 K and 1400 K, CH3OH has the highest thermal efficiency in those fuels throughout this trajectory. In general, a thermal efficiency for alcohol is higher than that for alkane. Moreover, fuel with lower molecular weight has higher thermal efficiency. For T T , GG = 1050 K, the thermal efficiency of 1-C4H9OH is almost equal to that of CH4. For the investigation to the thermal efficiency of the GG-ATR engine, it is assumed that the kinetic energy of the nozzle exhaust gas is proportional to the ram combustion temperature, T T , ram , (10) V e x t 2 ∝ T T , ram Thus, the assumption in Eq. (10) can derive the following formula concerned with the thermal efficiency, (11) η t h ∝ ( 1 + r OF ) T T , ram f h The right-hand side of equation (11) represents the ratio of the ram combustor temperature to heat release of the fuel within the engine. In the case of a turbojet engine, combustion occurs in fuel lean conditions, and an enthalpy increment at a burner is roughly proportional to heat release of fuel. However, at the ram combustor of the GG-ATR engine, fuel is often burnt under stoichiometric or fuel rich conditions. As indicated in Fig. 6(b), the peak T T , GG of CH3OH and C2H5OH for T T , ram are equal to about 1000 K and 1050 K, respectively. Therefore, the ram combustion for T T , GG = 1050 K is nearly stoichiometric ones. On the other hand, the peak T T , GG of alkanes for T T , ram are ranged from 1150 K to 1300 K. Thus, the ram combustion of alkanes for T T , GG = 1050 K corresponds to fuel rich one. In those cases, a part of fuel supplied to the GG is exhausted from the nozzle without being burned. The unburned fuel does not contribute to thrust production. That is why the thermal efficiencies of alkanes are lower than alcohols in T T , GG = 1050 K. In the case of T T , GG = 1400 K, the ram combustion for all fuels corresponds to fuel lean condition. The variances of thermal efficiencies among alcohols and alkanes are shrunken. However, the thermal efficiencies of CH3OH or C2H5OH are still higher than those of alkanes. The ram combustion temperature, T T , ram , of alkanes are much higher than that of alcohols as shown in Fig. 6(b). In higher T T , ram gas, radical species, such as H atom, O atom, and OH are much more produced. Fig. 17 shows the mole fractions of H atom, O atom, and OH in the ram combustor for T T , GG = 1400 K and π comp = 2.5 . The mole fractions of radical species for alkanes is higher than those for alcohols because of high temperature at the ram combustor. The formation of these radical species can absorb the heat release due to combustion. This heat absorption can reduce the ratio of the combustion temperature to the heat release of fuel, which is proportional to the thermal efficiency of the GG-ATR engine, as indicated in eq. (11). Therefore, high mole fractions of the radical species in the ram combustor result in the reduction of the thermal efficiencies. Finally, Fig. 18 indicates the overall efficiencies of the GG-ATR engine for those eight fuels. The thermal efficiencies for those fuels can significantly affect the magnitudes of the overall efficiency among them because the differences of the propulsive efficiency among those fuels are less than those of thermal efficiencies. From those analyses and discussions, the alcohol fuel is generally superior to the alkane fuels for the GG-ATR engine application for T T , GG less than 1100 K. The superiorities of alcohols are especially prominent for CH3OH and C2H5OH. For actual GG-ATR engine, T T , GG must be less than 1100 K because of a thermal limitation of a turbine blade. Therefore, the application of alcohol fuel is a reasonable choice for the GG-ATR engine."
11,Conclusion,"In the present study, the alcohols are compared with the alkanes to investigate those feasibilities to GG-ATR engine. The present study treats CH3OH, C2H5OH, 1-C3H7OH, and 1-C4H9OH for alcohol fuels. CH4, C2H6, C3H8 and 1-C4H10 are selected as alkanes. The conclusions of the present study are summarized below. 1. The specific thrust and ram combustor temperature, T T , ram , for those alcohols and alkanes are evaluated as functions of the GG combustion temperature, T T , GG . Those have the maximum values for T T , GG . In general, the peak T T , GG of alcohol is lower than that of alkane if the numbers of carbon atoms in fuel molecule are the same. The less the carbon atoms number is in fuel molecule, the lower peak T T , GG is. The peak T T , GG for T T , ram is equal to or a little higher than that for specific thrust. 2. For Isp of alkanes, the lower molecular weight of alkane can lead the higher Isp in T T , GG range from 900 K to 1400 K. On the other hand for alcohol fuels, in lower T T , GG condition, the relationship between Isp and molecular weight of alcohol fuel shows the same tendency with alkanes. The superiority of alcohol fuel to alkanes is significantly prominent in lower T T , GG condition. However, in higher T T , GG condition, this relationship is altered. For example in the case of π comp = 2.5 , the lower molecular weight alcohols, such as CH3OH or C2H5OH, have higher Isp than C2H6 or C3H8 for T T , GG less than 1050 K. This advantage becomes even more remarkable for higher π comp . This higher Isp of alcohols can be explained by higher T T , ram because the ram combustion in those conditions corresponds to the stoichiometric one. 3. The thermal efficiency of the GG-ATR engine largely depends on a state of ram combustion. The superiority of alcohol fuels can also appear in the thermal efficiency of the GG-ATR engine. For T T , GG = 1050 K and π comp = 2.5 , the ram combustion of alkanes corresponds to fuel-riched one, and some of the fuel does not burn. This unburned fuel reduces the thermal efficiency of the GG-ATR engine. On the other hand, for the same T T , GG and π comp , the ram combustion of alcohol is nearly under the stoichiometric condition, resulting in higher thermal efficiency. Alcohol has been scarcely used for aerospace vehicle fuels because of its lower specific heat release. However, the present study can indicate the superiority of alcohol fuel to alkane for the GG-ATR engine application, especially in lower T T , GG condition. Considering a thermal limitation of a turbine blade and, low T T , GG is preferable for the actual GG-ATR engine operation. Therefore, the utilization of alcohol is a reasonable option for the GG-ATR engine."
