0,Introduction,"Methyl glycolate (MG) as an important fine chemical applied in the synthesis of value-added biodegradable products is mainly produced via the traditional oil-based route employing the carboxylation of formaldehyde and the hydrolysis of chloroacetic acid processes, which suffers from the issues of rigorous reaction condition, heavy pollution and low product yield [1–5]. In contrast, catalytic selective hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) derivate from coal-based syngas to MG has emerged as a promising process for the MG production and thus received extensive interest from both academia and industry recently [6–8]. Among previously investigated catalysts, Ag-based ones possess high MG yield for the selective hydrogenation of DMO, because of the relatively low affinity of Ag toward H2 and its weak hydrogenolysis ability for MG, which is the intermediate product of the tandem hydrogenation of DMO [9–11]. Thus, high loadings of noble Ag in catalysts, typically 10%, are necessary to ensure desirable DMO conversion and MG yield. Many efforts have been devoted to enhance catalytic performances of Ag based catalysts [12–17], and more recently we reported a catalyst consisting of Ag nanoparticles anchored on amine-derivatized mesoporous silica nanospheres with a Ag loading down to 3 wt% exhibiting a 100% of DMO conversion with a MG selectivity up to 97% due to the unique microenvironment of the amine-derivatized channels [18]. However, it is still challenging for a rational design of excellent catalysts for DMO hydrogenation to MG, which calls for better mechanistic understandings on the relationship between catalyst structure and performance, especially at the level of active sites. For heterogeneous catalysis, the size of supported metal nanoparticles/clusters play a vital role in the catalytic performance, which is widely known as the structure sensitivity [19–21]. The underlying nature of such sensitivity is that differently typed sites exposed on the metal nanoparticles exhibit widely different catalytic performance, due to the varied electronic and/or geometric structures with metal nanoparticle sizes. Many catalytic hydrogenation reactions, such as the hydrogenation of CO/CO2 [22–24], hydrocarbons [25–28], alcohols [29,30], aldehydes [31,32] and esters [33,34], are typically structure-sensitive reaction, in which the intrinsic reaction rates are dominated by the size of supported metal nanoparticles. For the selective hydrogenation of DMO to MG, it has been found that for SBA-15 supported Ag catalysts, the turnover frequency for DMO conversion strongly depends on the average size of Ag crystallites, which justified the structure sensitivity of this hydrogenation reaction [35]. To date, however, the comprehensive understandings on such structure sensitivity of Ag catalyzed DMO hydrogenation to MG, especially at the level of active sites, have not been reported but is of great importance. Identifying the structure sensitivity and the actual active sites of Ag catalysts for this catalytic reaction can guide the rational design of catalysts and control the reaction pathways. In this work, we performed a systematic study on the size-dependent hydrogenation of DMO to MG over Ag catalysts. Various Ag nanoparticles with the particle size from 2.9 to 8.8 nm supported on amine-derivatized mesoporous silica nanospheres (AS) were prepared via reducing the immobilized Ag+ on amino functionalized surface by ethanol and employed for the catalytic hydrogenation of DMO. The structure sensitivity of Ag catalyzed DMO hydrogenation was discussed in detail at the level of active sites. The insights revealed here could provide fundamental guidance for precise modulation and design of supported metal catalysts for DMO hydrogenation to MG."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) is purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), triethanolamine (TEA), and 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTS) were provided from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. Cyclohexane, methylbenzene, ethanol, and silver nitrate (AgNO3) were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the reagents were used as received without further purification."
3,Preparation of the AS support,"2.2 Preparation of the AS support Mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNS) were synthesized by a two-phase layered method according to the literature [36], in which a cyclohexane solution of TEOS was used for the oil phase and a aqueous solution of CTAC for the water phase. Specifically, 0.4 g of TEA was added to 15 g of CTAC dissolved in 120 mL of deionized water and stirred gently at 333 K for 1 h. Subsequently, cyclohexane solution of TEOS (7.5 g of TEOS + 25 g of cyclohexane) was added dropwise to the above aqueous solution, which was kept under continuous magnetic stirring at 333 K for 12 h [37]. The resultant white suspension was collected by centrifugation, and the obtained solid sample was rinsed with excessive ethanol to remove the residues and then dried at 393 K for 4 h and calcined at 823 K for 4 h to remove CTAC to yield the desired MSNS. The amino-functionalized MSNS (AS) was synthesized by silanization of APTS via a post-grafting strategy [38]. Typically, 1.5 g of MSNS was ultrasonically dispersed in 50g of toluene, and then 0.5 g of APTS was added and refluxed at 383 K for 12 h under magnetic stirring. The resultant mixture was centrifuged and then rinsed with excessive ethanol to remove the residues. After drying for 4 h at 393 K, an amino-functionalized MSNS was finally obtained."
4,Preparation of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts,"2.3 Preparation of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts The Ag/AS catalysts with different Ag particle size were prepared via an in-situ reduction of Ag precursor (i.e., AgNO3) with changed amount. Typically, 1.0 g of AS was ultrasonically dispersed in 90 mL of ethanol to form a homogeneous suspension. A certain amount of AgNO3 was dissolved in 24.5 mL of ethanol, then added dropwise to the above suspension. The amount of AgNO3 is given by the Ag nominal loading of 1 wt%, 2 wt%, 3 wt%, 4 wt% and 5 wt%, for the five Ag/AS catalysts with differently Ag particle size, respectively. The mixture was stirred at 303 K for 4 h, and then the temperature was heated up to 343 K, at which the mixture was stirred for 24 h until the color of the suspension unchanged. The solid sample was centrifuged, rinsed with excessive ethanol, and dried at 333 K under a nitrogen atmosphere for 12 h to obtain the xAg/AS catalyst, where x represents the average Ag particle size on the AS support determined by TEM."
5,Catalyst characterizations,"2.4 Catalyst characterizations The specific surface areas (SBET) of the AS support and Ag/AS catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 apparatus. The average pore diameters and pore size distributions were obtained from desorption isotherm branch by the Barreett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The powdered X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were carried out on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 20 mA with a scanning angle (2θ) range of 10–80° and a scanning speed of 2° min−1. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) of the Ag/AS catalysts in the range of 200–800 nm were collected on an Agilent CARY 5000 UV–vis-NIR scanning spectrophotometer equiped with an integrating attachment using BaSO4 as the background standard. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were acquired on a JEOL JEM-2800 instrument at an operating voltage of 200 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F instrument at an operating voltage of 200 kV. The actual Ag loadings of the Ag/AS catalysts were determined by ion-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on an Agilent 5100 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Fisher K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with a 15 kV Al Kα X-ray radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV) and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. The binding energy were calibrated according to the binding energy of 284.6 eV for the carbonaceous C 1 s. In situ FTIR spectra of DMO adsorbed on the Ag/AS catalysts were conducted on a PerkinElmer Frontier spectrometer equiped with a transmission cell. Briefly, 30 mg of sample was compressed into a self-supporting wafer and carefully loaded into the transmission cell. The sample was pre-reduced under a 5% H2/N2 flow at 623 K for 3 h, followed by purging with N2 for 30 min. After cooling down to 353 K, the cell was vacuumed to remove the gaseous species. Then, a certain amount of DMO (e.g. 5.0 g) was placed in the saturator and heated to 353 K to melt DMO into liquid phase. Subsequently, DMO molecule was introduced into the cell with the aid of a vacuum pump and kept for 1 h to make saturated adsorption of DMO on the catalyst. The free gaseous DMO and weakly bound DMO on the catalyst were then evacuated by the vacuum pump. The FTIR spectra were collected at the reaction temperature (i.e., 493 K) with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and an accumulation of 64 scans. The specific surface areas of Ag on catalysts were determined by N2O chemisorption and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) on a Micrometrics Autochem II 2920 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) [39]. Briefly, 100 mg of the sample was pre-treated under 30 mL min−1 of pure He flow at 473 K for 1 h, and then reduced at 623 K under 50 mL min−1 of 10% H2/Ar for 3 h. After cooling down to 363 K under pure Ar, the sample was exposed to a 10% N2O/N2 (50 mL min−1) for 2 h to ensure that the surface metallic Ag atoms were completely oxidized to Ag2O. Subsequently, the sample was heated up to 573 K under 30 mL min−1 of Ar and kept for 30 min to remove residue gaseous species, and then cooled down to room temperature. Finally, the sample was annealed up to 1073 K under 50 mL min−1 of 10% H2/Ar at rate of 10 K min−1, and the hydrogen consumption was monitored by the detector during the annealing process. Temperature-programmed desorption of DMO (DMO-TPD) experiments were also performed on a Micrometrics Autochem II 2920 chemisorption and an online mass spectrometer (MS). The AS support were employed to physically dilute the catalyst sample to get a 1 wt% of Ag content for all the catalysts. Typically, 100 mg of diluted sample was reduced at 623 K for 3 h in 50 mL min−1 of 10% H2/Ar, followed by purging with 50 mL min−1 of pure He flow for 2 h at 573 K. After cooling down to 373 K, the vapor of DMO carried by Ar was introduced to the sample until saturated adsorption was reached. Subsequently, the sample was purged by 50 mL min−1 of pure Ar for 90 min to remove physically absorbed DMO molecules. Finally, the sample was heated from 373 K to 1073 K at a ramping rate of 5 K min−1 in 50 mL min−1 of pure Ar, and the TPD profile was collected. The released DMO molecule was traced by an online mass spectrometer (OmniStar 200) with a MS signal of m/z = 59 in multiple ion detection (MID) mode."
6,Catalytic evaluation,"2.5 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic performance of the Ag/AS catalysts for the hydrogenation of DMO was carried out in a stainless steel fixed-bed tubular reactor. Considering that the loading of Ag in differently sized catalysts are different, the amounts of catalysts used for the performance tests were calculated by a given mass for Ag, i.e., 10.0 mg, for all catalysts. The Ag/AS catalysts (40–60 mesh) were physically diluted with AS support (40–60 mesh) to give a total amount of 1.0 g sample, which was then loaded into the constant temperature zone of the tubular reactor. Both sides of the catalyst bed were packed with quartz powder (40–60 mesh). Catalyst sample was reduced under 30 mL min−1 of H2 flow at 623 K for 4 h. After cooling down to the reaction temperature of 493 K, a 10 wt% of DMO in methanol solution was pumped into vaporizer set at 473 K by a P230 digital HPLC pump (eliteHPLC), and then flow into the catalyst bed with H2 at a H2/DMO molar ratio of 80 under a system pressure of 2.0 MPa. After the reaction stabilized, the outlet stream was sampled using an automatic Valco 6-port valve system at intervals of 30 min and analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) equipped with flame ionization detection and a KB-Wax capillary column (30 m × 0.45 mm × 0.85 μm). The conversion of DMO and the selectivity of product were calculated based on the following equations: C o n v e r s i o n % = mol o f D M O i n - m o l o f D M O o u t mol o f D M O i n × 100 % S e l e c t i v i t y % = mol o f M G o r E G ( o u t ) mol o f D M O i n - m o l o f D M O ( o u t ) × 100 % Apparent turnover frequencies (TOFapp) were calculated by [39]: TOF app = W × V × C DMO D × N Ag where W is the concentration of DMO in methanol solution (mol/L), V is the flow rate of the DMO in methanol solution (L/h), CDMO is the conversion of DMO, NAg is the total amount of Ag (mol) in the catalyst used for tests, D is the Ag dispersion obtained from N2O chemisorption and H2-TPR measurements."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structural and morphologies of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts,"3.1 Structural and morphologies of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts Catalysts consisting of differently sized Ag nanoparticles anchored on amine-derivatized mesoporous silica nanospheres (Ag/AS catalysts) were prepared by reducing AgNO3 precursors with different concentrations using ethanol as a reductant. The actual loadings of Ag in these catalysts were subsequently determined by ICP-OES, and the results are listed in Table 1 , which show that the Ag loadings are close to the nominal values. These suggest that most of the silver species in the precursor of AgNO3 are concentrated onto the support during the reduction process. N2 physisorption measurements were then performed to investigate the influence of Ag immobilization on the pore structures of the AS support. Fig. 1 a shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of AS support and the Ag/AS catalysts, where the AS support and differently sized Ag/AS catalysts all exhibit typical type IV physisorption curves with H3 hysteresis loops normally observed with mesoporous materials [40,41]. These similar N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms suggest that the immobilization of Ag nanoparticles does not change the mesoporous characteristic of the AS support. The pore size distributions obtained according to the BJH model are presented in Fig. 1 b, and the calculated pore volume and specific surface area of these samples are listed in Table 1. It can be clearly seen that the pore sizes, pore volumes and specific area decrease with the content of Ag in the catalysts, which is a result of the immobilization of tiny Ag nanoparticles into the mesoporous channels [42]. Notably, the decrease is remarkable for the Ag/AS catalysts with the content of Ag higher than 3 wt%, implying that large Ag nanoparticles may be synthesized when increasing the content of Ag and thus block the mesopores of AS in part. XRD patterns in Fig. 1 c further show the differences in the structures of Ag/AS catalysts with different Ag loadings. For the 2.9Ag/AS and 4.1Ag/AS catalysts with relatively low Ag loadings, the diffraction peaks corresponding to Ag crystal is hardly seen in the XRD patterns, suggesting small and well dispersed Ag nanoparticles on the support in both catalysts. Increasing the loading of Ag to 2.91 wt%, i.e., for the 5.3Ag/AS catalyst, the peak assigned to Ag(111) appears in the XRD pattern, which indicates an increase in the Ag particle size. As expected, the further increase in the loading results in large Ag nanoparticles on the support, as evidenced by the more evident diffraction peaks at 38.2°, 44.3°, 64.5° and 77.6°, which are assigned to (111), (200), (220) and (311) facets of Ag (PDF 87-0720), respectively. These results are subsequently corroborated by the UV–vis DRS spectra of the Ag/AS catalysts in Fig. 1 d, where the surface plasmon resonance peak of Ag red shifts from 366 to 501 nm when increasing Ag loading from 1.03 wt% to 4.40 wt%, indicative of the increase in the Ag particle size [43–45]. In addition, an evident attenuation is also seen with the absorption peak at 313 nm assigned to Ag cluster [46,47] when increasing the loading of Ag, implying a decrease in the amount of small sized Ag particles. Finally, results from N2O chemisorption and H2-TPR experiments (Table 1) show that the dispersion of Ag and the specific Ag surface area in Ag/AS gradually decrease with the increasing loadings of Ag, which is a result of the increase in Ag nanoparticle size. All these results clearly demonstrate that differently sized Ag nanoparticles are successfully immobilized on the AS support. TEM and HAADF-STEM were employed to further characterize the morphologies of these supported Ag/AS catalysts. Fig. 2 a-e shows the typical HAADF-STEM images of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts, and the corresponding TEM images are reported in Fig. S1, on which Ag nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the AS support. Statistics based on the histograms for the particle size distribution shown in the insets were carried out for 2.9Ag/AS, 4.1Ag/AS, 5.3Ag/AS, 6.3Ag/AS and 8.8Ag/AS catalysts, which yield the average sizes of Ag nanoparticles, i.e., 2.9, 4.1, 5.3, 6.3 and 8.8 nm, respectively. These results are in good accordance with the XRD and UV–vis DRS characterizations which demonstrate that the Ag particle size increase with the loading of Ag. HRTEM images of these differently sized Ag/AS catalysts in Fig. 2 a′ - e′ display clear lattice fringes, which are determined to be (111) and/or (200) planes of face-centered cubic Ag crystal. In addition, grain boundaries indicated by the irregular lattice fringes can be observed in the HRTEM image of 2.9Ag/AS, 4.1Ag/AS and 5.3Ag/AS catalysts, whilst the lattice fringes become regular as the Ag particle size increase to 6.3 and 8.8 nm. These distinct microstructures characteristics may contribute to different catalytic performances."
9,Size-dependent Ag catalyzed DMO hydrogenation,"3.2 Size-dependent Ag catalyzed DMO hydrogenation The catalytic performances of these Ag/AS catalysts were comparatively investigated in a fixed-bed reactor at 493 K and 2.0 MPa with a H2/DMO ratio of 80. The conversion of DMO as well as the selectivities to MG and EG of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts are compared at various WHSV in Fig. 3 . These Ag/AS catalysts show a gradual decreasing DMO conversion and EG selectivity but increasing MG selectivity with the increasing WHSV, which are caused by the shortening residence time and thus suppressed hydrogenation process [48]. The differences in hydrogenation activity of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts can be distinguished at relatively high WHSV. At the WHSV higher than 50 gDMO · gAg -1 · h−1, the conversions of DMO over these Ag/AS catalysts decrease in the order of 4.1Ag/AS > 5.3Ag/AS > 2.9Ag/AS > 6.3Ag/AS > 8.8Ag/AS (Fig. 3 a). At the WHSV lower than 50 gDMO · gAg -1 · h−1, although all the catalysts show 100% of DMO conversion, the differences in EG selectivity also decrease in the order of 4.1Ag/AS > 5.3Ag/AS > 2.9Ag/AS > 6.3Ag/AS > 8.8Ag/AS, suggesting the decreased hydrogenation activity following this order (Fig. 3 b). Due to the similar MG selectivity at the WHSV higher than 50 gDMO · gAg -1 · h−1, catalysts with higher activity show higher yield to the target MG, and thus the yields to MG over Ag/AS catalysts also decrease in the order of 4.1Ag/AS > 5.3Ag/AS > 2.9Ag/AS > 6.3Ag/AS > 8.8Ag/AS (Fig. S2). These results clearly demonstrate size-dependent hydrogenation of DMO, and 4.1Ag/AS catalyst show the highest apparent hydrogenation activity at the WHSV higher than 50 gDMO · gAg -1 · h−1. Turnover frequency of DMO conversion was further determined by increasing the WHSV up to several times higher level in order to make sure the conversion lower than 20%, at which transport limitation can be approximately ignored. The converted rate of DMO is normalized according to the number of surface atoms determined by N2O chemisorption combined with H2-TPR measurement (Table 1), which give an apparent turnover frequency (TOFapp) for DMO conversion to compare the hydrogenation activity more clearly. The detailed calculation process of TOFapp is shown in supporting information (Table S1). The TOFapp of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts in Fig. 4 a shows a volcano-shape trend with the increasing Ag particle size, where a maximum value of 227 h−1 appears at the Ag particle size of 5.3 nm. This volcano curve between the TOFapp and the Ag particle size indicates that Ag catalyzed DMO hydrogenation is a typical structure-sensitive reaction, which means that differently typed surface sites show diverse hydrogenation activities and some sites may dominate this reaction. It is thus necessary to identify how many types of surface sites as well as their number varying with the Ag particle size, which necessitate the identification of the Ag nanoparticle shape. HRTEM characterizations were then employed to investigate the shape of Ag nanoparticles. Fig. 4 b and Fig. S3 show the typical HRTEM images of Ag/AS catalyst, where Ag nanoparticles with a well-defined shape are clearly observed. The shape of Ag nanoparticles is suggested as cuboctahedron with exposing (111) and (200) facets on the surface with an intersection angle of 54.7° as revealed by the corresponding fast Fourier transfer pattern in Fig. 4 c. Based on the shape of Ag nanoparticles, six differently typed surface sites can be identified clearly (Fig. 4 d). The term of Bn site is employed to denote these typed surface sites. Specifically, the B1 site represents the surface atoms at corners where multiple facets terminate, and the B2 site describes a pair of nearest neighbours atoms at edges. The B3 and B4 sites are terrace sites, which containing three atoms on the (111) surface situated at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with sides equal to Ag atomic diameter and four atoms on the (100) surface positioned at the corners of a square with sides equal to Ag atomic diameter, respectively. The B5A and B5B sites are step sites consisting of five atoms located at the step along with two different directions. According to the method proposed by Van Hardeveld et al. [49], the number of Bn sites and the number of surface atoms, i.e., N(Bn) and NS, respectively, can be calculated on the basis of the cuboctahedron shape model. The calculations details and resultant the geometric parameters of Ag nanoparticles on differently sized Ag/AS catalysts can be found in supporting information (Table S2). Fig. 4 e displays the ratios of different types of surface sites to the overall surface sites, i.e., the N(Bn)/NS, as a function of Ag particle size. It can be clearly seen that the ratios of these diverse surface sites are dependent on the Ag particle size. These size-dependent ratios of diverse surface sites should be associated with the size-dependent hydrogenation activity. If one type of active site dominates the hydrogenation activity, the reaction rate based on the number of this active site (i.e., TOFactive site) would be constant, that is, the TOFactive site would be size independent [50]. Along this line, the numbers of differently typed Bn sites for these Ag/AS catalysts were first calculated by multiplying the ratio of Bn sites with the total numbers of surface sites determined by N2O chemisorption combined with H2-TPR measurement for the catalysts (Table 1). The converted rates of DMO over differently sized Ag/AS catalysts were then normalized by the numbers of five types of surface sites to obtain the five series of TOF values against with the Ag particle size. Finally, the TOF values were normalized by the maximum of each series TOF for each type of sites to yield the normalized TOF values, named as TOF(Bn) (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B). The TOF(Bn) are plotted as a function of the Ag particle size in Fig. 4 f, in which TOF(B1), TOF(B3), TOF(B4) and TOF(B5B) exhibit strong dependence on the Ag particle size rather than to be constant with the Ag particle size, indicating that the B1, B3, B4 and B5B sites are not the dominant active sites for DMO hydrogenation. In contrast, when consider B2 and B5A as the active site, respectively, the corresponding TOF, i.e., TOF(B2) and TOF(B5A) are found to be almost constant for Ag/AS catalysts with the particle size of ≥ 5.3 nm, indicating that the step-like B2 and B5A sites are the dominant active sites for DMO hydrogenation. The number of step-like sites on Ag nanoparticles shaped in cuboctahedron increases with downsizing the particle size in the range of 3–16 nm (Fig. 4 e), and thus the apparent hydrogenation activity (TOFapp) should also increase with downsizing the particle size. As seen in Fig. 4 a, the Ag/AS catalysts with the particle size of ≥5.3 nm exhibit increasing TOFapp with the decreasing Ag particle size, whereas the catalysts with the particle size of <5.3 nm show a reverse trend. Moreover, the normalized TOF(B2) and TOF(B5A) for DMO hydrogenation over Ag/AS catalysts with the particle size of < 5.3 nm are lower than the constant ones seen with the catalysts sized in ≥ 5.3 nm. Previous studies have well shown that the activity of small sized metal catalysts depends on the electronic properties instead of the geometric properties. Thus, the activity of these smaller sized Ag catalysts could be dominated by other factors, very likely the electronic properties, rather than the number of active sites (i.e., the step-like sites) [50–52]."
10,Understandings on structure-sensitivity of Ag catalyzed DMO hydrogenation,"3.3 Understandings on structure-sensitivity of Ag catalyzed DMO hydrogenation To gain more insights into the structure-sensitivity of DMO hydrogenation over Ag catalysts, the electronic properties of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts were further characterized and compared in Fig. 5 . The Ag 3d XPS spectra in Fig. 5 a demonstrate that Ag0 3d5/2 and Ag0 3d3/2 peaks shift to higher binding energy as the Ag particle size decrease from 8.8 to 5.3 nm, which is caused by the so-called differential charging effects dependent on the conductivity of supported Ag nanoparticles [53]. Higher conductivity of larger Ag nanoparticles compared to smaller ones gives rise to more effective compensation of the surface charge induced by photoemission and thus lower binding energy. However, when the particle size further decreases to 4.1 and 2.9 nm, the Ag0 3d5/2 and Ag0 3d3/2 peaks shift back to lower binding energies. Such shift in binding energy has been proved to be a result of a decrease in electron density of Ag. The decrease in electron density of metal with small particle sizes is also widely observed in previous studies [54,55]. To further confirm this phenomenon, the Ag MNN Auger electron spectra of differently sized Ag/AS catalysts is shown in Fig. S4. The Ag M4N45N45 Auger peak shifts to the lower kinetic energy by 0.3 eV as the Ag particle size decreases from 8.8 to 5.3 nm, and further to the lower kinetic energy by 0.7 eV when the Ag particle size decreases to 2.9 nm. The variation in the kinetic energy with the Ag particle size is more obvious than that seen with the B.E. values. It has been indicated that Auger parameters analysis can be employed to analyze the chemical state without considering the charging effect [56]. Thus, the Auger parameters were also calculated by summing the values of kinetic energy of M4N45N45 Auger peak and the values of binding energy of Ag0 3d5/2 peak for differently sized Ag catalysts to further study the electronic structure [57]. It can be clearly seen from the Ag Wagner plot (Fig. S4) that the Auger parameter is constant (i.e., 726.4 eV) for the Ag catalysts sized from 8.8 to 5.3 nm, indicating the similar Ag electronic structure. Notably, when the Ag particle size decreases from 5.3 to 2.9 nm, the parameter decreases remarkably from 726.4 to 725.6 eV, suggesting a clear decrease in electron density of Ag [58–60]. These results are in good accordance with the XPS analysis in Fig. 5 a. The remarkably different electronic properties of the 4.1Ag/AS and 2.9Ag/AS catalysts could account for the lower activity than the other ones with larger particle sizes (Fig. 4 f). This is further confirmed by the juxtaposed Ag Auger parameter and TOFapp in Fig. 5 b, where a good correlation between the activity and Auger parameter is clearly seen for the Ag/AS catalysts sized < 5.3 nm. For the catalysts with size ≥ 5.3 nm, the Auger parameter is constant, and thus the decreased activity with increasing particle size cannot be attributed to the electronic properties. Instead, this decreasing activity is mainly caused by the decreased amount of active sites as discussed above, i.e., geometric aspects. The activation of DMO on differently sized Ag/AS catalysts were further explored by in-situ FTIR and TPD measurements. The FTIR spectrum of free DMO in Fig. 6 a exhibits two peaks at 1805 and 1775 cm−1 associated with the CO stretching, one peak at 1472 cm−1 corresponding to the CH3 asymmetric deformation, and another two peaks at 1234 and 1184 cm−1 ascribed to CO vibrations [61]. Notably, all the peaks corresponding to the CO and CO vibrations in DMO shift to lower wavenumbers after adsorption over the xAg/AS catalysts, especially those related to the CO group, whereas the peak associated with the CH3 group remains unchanged, suggesting the adsorption of DMO via the CO groups. The peaks assigned to CO and CO upon adsorption on the xAg/AS catalyst show gradual red-shifts from 1780 and 1749 cm−1 to 1750 and 1720 cm−1, respectively, when the silver particle size is reduced from 8.8 to 5.3 nm. This gradual shift suggests enhanced adsorption of DMO on xAg/AS catalyst with decreasing Ag particle size [62], which is mainly resulted from the increased number of step-like sites, i.e., active sites, with decreasing Ag sizes. However, when Ag particle size further decreases to 4.1 and 2.9 nm, the CO peaks shift in the opposite direction to higher wavenumbers, a sign of weakened adsorption of DMO. Considering that the adsorption of DMO on electron-rich metal surface is more favorable [10,35,63,64], the weakened adsorption of DMO could be interpreted by the changed electronic properties, i.e., the decreased electron density of Ag in 4.1Ag/AS and 2.9Ag/AS catalysts revealed by XPS measurements. Fig. 6 b shows the TPD profiles for DMO adsorbed on differently sized Ag/AS catalysts as well as the support, in which a peak at 600–800 K associated with DMO desorption is clearly observed [18]. It should be noted that no obvious adsorption of DMO on the AS support compared to that on the catalysts, excluding the influence of the support on the DMO adsorption. The peak temperature of DMO desorption from the xAg/AS catalyst increases from 652 to 752 K when the particle size decreases from 8.8 to 5.3 nm, showing enhanced adsorption of DMO with downsizing particle size. This could be a result of the increased number of step-like sites with the decreasing particle size. These results are well consistent with the ones obtained from FTIR. However, further decrease in the particle to 4.1 and 2.9 nm leads to a decrease in the desorption temperature, suggesting weakened adsorption of DMO, which is owing to the decreased electron density of Ag. This demonstrated activation behavior of DMO on the differently sized Ag/AS catalysts well interprets the size-dependent hydrogenation activity. Based on all the above discussion, it can be concluded that the hydrogenation of DMO to MG over Ag/AS catalysts is mainly dominated by the number of active sites when Ag particle size ≥ 5.3 nm but by the electronic properties of Ag when the Ag particle size < 5.3 nm."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, catalysts consisting of Ag nanoparticles sized from 2.9 to 8.8 nm anchored on amine-derivatized mesoporous silica nanospheres were synthesized and employed for the selective hydrogenation of DMO to MG. The hydrogenation activities of Ag/AS catalysts show a volcano-shape trend with the increasing Ag particle size, demonstrating a typical structure sensitivity. Based on the cuboctahedron model for Ag nanoparticle, the origin of the size-dependent performance has been explored, which point out that the step-likes are the dominant active sites for DMO hydrogenation. Further XPS, in situ DRIFTS and TPD studies demonstrate that hydrogenation of DMO to MG over Ag/AS catalysts is mainly dominated by the number of active sites when Ag particle size ≥ 5.3 nm but by the electronic properties of Ag when the Ag particle size < 5.3 nm. Due to the balance between the number of active sites and electronic structure, a maximal reaction rate in term of apparent TOF is achieved on the Ag/AS catalyst with Ag particle size of 5.3 nm."
