0,Introduction,"Utilizing semiconductor photocatalysts to convert solar energy into hydrogen energy is considered to be one of the prospective strategies for solving the problem of energy crisis [1–6]. Among the semiconductor photocatalysts, TiO2 has been widely used in the field of photocatalytic water splitting due to its non-toxic properties, superior chemical stability and abundant resource [7–10]. Unfortunately, its photocatalytic H2-evolution performance is very limited because of the high recombination rate of photogenerated charges and slow interfacial hydrogen-production reaction [11,12]. To improve the H2-production efficiency of TiO2, cocatalyst modification on TiO2 surface is deemed as one of the efficient methods because cocatalysts can rapidly transfer the photogenerated electrons and provide hydrogen-evolution active sites [13–15]. In recent years, various metal compounds as photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution cocatalysts such as metal .phosphides (Ni2P, Co2P, Cu3P, etc.) [16–18], metal carbides (Mo2C, WC, etc.) [19,20], and metal sulfides (NiS x , CoS2, MoS2, etc.) [21–23] have been widely reported. In particular, metal sulfides are broadly applied to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen-production performance owing to the unsaturated S atoms on the edge of metal sulfides with a strong ability for adsorbing hydrogen ions, which can be served as effective interfacial hydrogen-evolution active sites [24–26]. However, the reports on hydrogen-evolution cocatalysts of metal sulfides mainly focus on transition-metal sulfides, and the researches about non-transition metal sulfides are relatively insufficient. Therefore, it is of great significance to further develop new non-transition metal sulfide cocatalysts to promote the photocatalytic H2-production activity of photocatalysts. Bismuth sulfide, a typical non-transition metal sulfide, has aroused great interest in the field of photocatalysis, hydrogen evolution, and solar cells owing to its efficient carrier capturing capability, low cost, nontoxicity, and good chemical stability [27–29]. For instance, Liu et al. found that the crystalline Bi2S3 nanowires with average length of 1.5 µm by a solvothermal process (200°C, 2 h) promoted the photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation activity and stability of TiO2 photoanode [30]. Li et al. reported that the Bi2S3/Cd0.5Zn0.5S photocatalyst was prepared through a microwave-assisted method in the microwave reactor (500 W, 120°C) and represented an obviously boosted H2-production performance compared with the pure Cd0.5Zn0.5S [31]. Majhi et al. described that the crystalline Bi2S3 nanoparticles with size ranging between 15 and 25 nm were used to construct Bi2S3/b-Bi2O3/ZnIn2S4 ternary photocatalyst via a reflux route, which exhibited prominent visible-light photocatalytic activity for aqueous phase tetracycline degradation, Cr(VI) reduction, and H2 evolution [32]. These works proved that Bi2S3 could be acted as an efficient cocatalyst to distinctly enhance the H2-evolution activity, primarily because the active unsaturated S atoms on Bi2S3 worked as effective H2-production reaction sites to adsorb H+ ions in the solution. However, the above-mentioned preparation methods about bismuth sulfide usually require relatively extreme conditions (high temperature, high pressure, or multiple synthetic procedures), resulting in that the pre-prepared crystalline Bi2S3 exhibited large particles (>10 nm) and limited interfacial active sites. Compared to the crystalline Bi2S3 with a large size, the small and amorphous BiS x nanodots (<2 nm) with more unsaturated S atoms as active centers are expected to be helpful for hydrogen production, which a similar point has been proven in our previous work [33]. Therefore, it is necessary and significant to explore simple and mild methods to synthesize amorphous BiS x nanodots for the boosted hydrogen-generation performance of photocatalysts. In this work, the amorphous BiS x nanodots as a hydrogen-production cocatalyst were modified on the TiO2 surface by an EDTA-assisted two-step method, including the absorption of the Bi(Ш)-EDTA ions on the TiO2 and the in-situ conversion of BiS x . In this case, the strong complexation between EDTA and Bi3+ ion easily generates stable Bi(Ш)-EDTA ions and prevents the rapid hydrolysis of Bi3+, which can be of great benefit to the following formation of amorphous BiS x nanodots. The prepared BiS x /TiO2 samples displayed a markedly enhanced hydrogen-evolution performance in comparison with the blank TiO2. Based on test results, a possible mechanism of BiS x for promoting hydrogen production was proposed, that is, the unsaturated S of amorphous BiS x can act as the interfacial active centers to facilitate the hydrogen-production rate of TiO2. This work can provide a new synthesis strategy for developing the new amorphous metal-sulfide nanodot cocatalysts for optimizing photocatalytic H2-generation activity of photocatalysts."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Titanium dioxide (TiO2, P25), bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5 H2O), thioacetamide (TAA), edetic acid (EDTA), cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2·4 H2O), melamine (C3H6N6), sodium sulfide (Na2S·9 H2O), and ethyl alcohol were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Ltd. (P.R. China). All chemicals were of analytic grade and used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of BiSx/TiO2 photocatalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of BiSx/TiO2 photocatalyst The BiS x /TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared via the EDTA-assisted two-step methods including the absorption of Bi(Ш)-EDTA ions on the TiO2 and the in-situ formation of amorphous BiS x nanodots. Typically, 200 mg TiO2 was dispersed into 50 mL deionized water to form a white suspension, and then a certain volume of pre-prepared Bi(Ш)-EDTA complex solution was added into the preceding white suspension under constant stirring at room temperature. After stirring for 30 min, an excessive TAA was injected and maintained at 60°C for 8 h. Subsequently, the obtained materials were filtered, washed, and dried overnight (60°C). To explore the effect of different amounts of amorphous BiS x nanodots on the hydrogen-evolution performance of TiO2, the BiS x -modified TiO2 samples with different ratios were prepared and named as BiS x /TiO2(x wt%), where the x was the weight percent of Bi to TiO2 and x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0. In this case, the ratio of Bi to TiO2 can be controlled by the different volumes of pre-prepared Bi-EDTA complex solution in presence of excessive TAA during the synthesis process. To compare with the amorphous BiS x -modified TiO2 photocatalyst, the crystalline Bi2S3-modified TiO2 (c-Bi2S3/TiO2(5.0 wt%)) was synthesized via calcining the BiS x /TiO2(5.0 wt%) at 400°C for 2 h under N2 atmosphere."
4,Synthesis of BiSx/CdS and BiSx/g-C3N4 photocatalysts,"2.3 Synthesis of BiSx/CdS and BiSx/g-C3N4 photocatalysts To explore the universality of amorphous BiS x cocatalyst, the BiS x /CdS(1.0 wt%) and BiS x /g-C3N4(1.0 wt%) samples were also synthesized by the same synthesis procedure as the above BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%). The CdS and g-C3N4 photocatalysts were obtained via the previous report [34]."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The morphological structure and microstructure of the as-obtained samples were illustrated through field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (JSM-7500 F, JEOL, Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2100 F, JEOL, Japan). The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Rigaku, D/MX-IIIA, Japan) was used to evaluate the crystal structure. The chemical states of different elements of the photocatalysts were performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Fisher, ESCALAB 250Xi, USA). The actual contents of Bi and S in the samples were collected by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (Prodigy 7, LEEMAN LABS, USA). The UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan) was performed to confirm the optical absorption property of different photocatalysts. The time-resolved PL spectra were evaluated by the fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (FLS920 Edinburgh Instruments, UK)."
6,Photocatalytic H2-evolution measurement,"2.5 Photocatalytic H2-evolution measurement The hydrogen-generation experiments of the photocatalysts were performed in line with our previous work [35]. Typically, 50 mg of the photocatalysts were dispersed into ethanol aqueous solution to form a suspension (80 mL, 25 vol%). The system was degassed under N2 atmosphere for 15 min. After four 365 nm-LED lights (365 nm, Shenzhen LAMPLIC, China) irradiated the system, 400 μL of gas was injected into a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2014 C, Japan) with a thermal conductivity detector and a 5 Å molecular sieve column. The apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) of various photocatalysts were evaluated through the following equation: AQE ( % ) = number of reacted electrons number of incident photons × 100 = number of evolved H 2 molecules × 2 number of incident photons × 100"
7,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical experiments were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua Instrument, China) with a common three-electrode system, including the 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution, the Pt electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl electrode, and the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass coated with photocatalysts as the electrolyte solution, counter, reference, and working electrode, respectively [36,37]. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve was performed on the bias voltage range from − 0.6 to − 1.5 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded at a frequency range of 10−3–106 Hz."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthetic strategy of BiSx/TiO2,"3.1 Synthetic strategy of BiSx/TiO2 The fabrication of the BiS x /TiO2 samples can be simplified into two steps, including the adsorption of Bi(Ш)-EDTA ions on the TiO2 and the in-situ formation of amorphous BiS x nanodots, as shown in Fig. 1. In general, the strong complexation between EDTA and Bi3+ ions can easily generate Bi(Ш)-EDTA ions due to the high stability constant of Bi(Ш)-EDTA (K f = 1022.8) [38], which can prevent the hydrolysis of Bi3+ (Fig. 1C-1). When the positive Bi(Ш)-EDTA ions are added into the negative TiO2 suspension, the TiO2 suspension (Fig. 1A-a) adsorbs the Bi(Ш)-EDTA complex ions to easily form Bi(Ш)-EDTA/TiO2 (Fig. 1A-b) through the electrostatic interaction (Fig. 1C-2) [39]. In this case, the corresponding suspension still remains homogeneously white (Fig. 1B-a and b). As a certain amount of TAA is added into the above system and maintained to 60°C, the TAA is slowly decomposed to release S2- ions (Fig. 1C-3) [32], which further react with the adsorbed Bi(Ш)-EDTA on the TiO2 to produce BiS x /TiO2 (Fig. 1C-4). As a result, the Bi(Ш)-EDTA/TiO2 in-situ generates BiS x /TiO2 (Fig. 1A-c) and the corresponding suspension color noticeably changes from white to brown (Fig. 1B-c left). After aging for 5 min, a gray-black BiS x /TiO2 precipitation with a quite clear and colorless supernatant is formed, further implying that the strong interaction between the BiS x nanodots and TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 1B-c right). Considering the mild reaction conditions, it can be inferred that the prepared BiS x presents an amorphous structure [40]. Based on the above analysis, the amorphous BiS x -modified TiO2 photocatalyst has been successfully prepared by EDTA-assisted synthesis strategy."
10,Microstructures of BiSx/TiO2 photocatalysts,"3.2 Microstructures of BiSx/TiO2 photocatalysts To confirm the formation of BiS x /TiO2 samples, their microstructures are first illustrated by XRD, FESEM, TEM and EDS mapping. From the XRD patterns and FESEM images, the bare TiO2 (P25) shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase and rutile phases ( Fig. 2a) [41], and is composed of aggregated small nanoparticles (10–50 nm) ( Fig. 3A). After the modification by the BiS x nanodots, the prepared BiS x /TiO2 samples present the analogous diffraction peaks (Fig. 2b-d) and morphology (Fig. 3B-D) compared to the blank TiO2, manifesting that the crystal structure and morphology of the TiO2 cannot be impacted through the amorphous BiS x nanodots. To obtain further information about BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%) samples, the TEM and EDS mapping images of the pure TiO2 (Fig. S1) and BiS x /TiO2 ( Fig. 4) are carried out. After the modification by the BiS x nanodots, the BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%) sample (Fig. 4A and B) is also composed of similar size nanoparticles to the blank TiO2. Importantly, plenty of small dark nanodots appear in the BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%) (Fig. 4A) and are evenly distributed on the TiO2 surface. These small dark nanodots with the size of 0.5–2 nm are homogeneously deposited on the TiO2 particles with the lattice fringe of 0.35 nm [42,43], as shown in Fig. 4B. In this case, the small dark nanodots exhibit no obvious lattice fringes and can be attributed to the amorphous BiS x nanodots, owing to the present mild preparation conditions. To further determine the element distribution of BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%), its element mapping is performed and shown in Fig. 4C-C4. The Bi (Fig. 4 C3) and S (Fig. 4 C4) elements are evenly dispersed on the TiO2 surface except for the primary Ti (Fig. 4 C1) and O (Fig. 4 C2), clearly indicating that the amorphous BiS x nanodots are evenly modified on the TiO2 surface [44]. According to the above results, the amorphous BiS x nanodots have been homogeneously modified on TiO2 and do not affect its lattice structure and morphology. The XPS spectra and ICP-OES results can determine the element contents and their chemical state of the BiS x /TiO2. It can be seen from the XPS survey ( Fig. 5A) that the C element (284.8 eV) in all samples is derived from adventitious carbon, while the Ti 2p (458.3 eV) and O 1 s (529.4 eV) can be assigned to TiO2 [45–47]. Further investigating the high-resolution XPS in Fig. 5B-C, all the BiS x /TiO2 photocatalysts clearly exhibit the similar Ti and O peaks to the pure TiO2. In this case, the peaks at 529.4, 531.7, and ca. 533 eV (Fig. 5C) can be assigned to lattice oxygen species (Ti-O-Ti), surface-absorbed hydroxyl groups (Ti-OH), and adsorbed water molecules, respectively [48]. More importantly, the distinct Bi and S peaks appear in the BiS x /TiO2(5.0 wt%) sample (Fig. 5D-c) compared with the blank TiO2 (Fig. 5D-a), where the binding energy of 158.9, 164.2, 162.0, and 164.8 eV can be attributed to Bi3+ 4 f7/2, Bi3+ 4 f5/2, S2- 2p, and unsaturated S atom (Fig. 5E) [49,50], respectively. To further obtain the precise contents of Bi and S elements in the BiS x /TiO2 photocatalyst, the data of ICP-OES are described in Table S1. Clearly, with the increasing weight percent of BiS x to TiO2, the mass fraction of Bi and S elements increases and the molar ratio of S to Bi is higher than 1.5 (>1.85), strongly confirming the sulfur-rich property of the present amorphous structure of the BiS x nanodots. Based on the abovementioned results, it can be fully manifested that the amorphous BiS x -modified TiO2 photocatalysts have been successfully prepared. The UV-Vis absorption spectra can show the light absorption capacities of BiS x /TiO2 photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 6a, the pure TiO2 displays the absorption edge at ca. 390 nm [51]. After the modification of amorphous BiS x nanodots, the prepared BiS x /TiO2 samples (Fig. 6b-f) reveal the same absorption edge as the TiO2. Moreover, the absorption intensity of the BiS x /TiO2 photocatalysts is significantly enhanced in the range of 400–800 nm, and the color of the photocatalysts obviously changes from gray to brown black (the inset of Fig. 6). In conclusion, the UV-Vis absorption results further demonstrate that the amorphous BiS x nanodots are only coupled on the TiO2 surface."
11,Photocatalytic activity and mechanism,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity and mechanism To estimate the effect of the amorphous BiS x cocatalyst on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, the photocatalytic hydrogen-generation test of BiS x /TiO2 samples is carried out under the irradiation of UV light in 25 vol% ethanol aqueous solution and the result is displayed in Fig. 7A. The pure TiO2 (Fig. 7A-a) exhibits the trace amount of hydrogen (9.6 μmol h−1 g−1, AQE=0.05%, Table 1) primarily because of the rapid recombination of photoinduced charges. After modified by amorphous BiS x nanodots, all the BiS x /TiO2 photocatalysts reveal a distinctly improved H2-evolution. Especially, the BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%) sample presents the maximum hydrogen production rate (803.2 μmol h−1 g−1, AQE = 3.86%), which is ca. 83.6-fold improvement compared with that of the pure TiO2. More importantly, the BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%) sample (Fig. 7B) still maintains a good hydrogen production activity after six cycling measurements, strongly indicating its satisfying stability and repeatability. To confirm the improvement of amorphous BiS x nanodots on the photocatalytic H2-evolution activity of TiO2, the crystalline Bi2S3-modified TiO2 (c-Bi2S3/TiO2(5.0 wt%)), which is prepared via calcining the BiS x /TiO2(5.0 wt%) at 400°C for 2 h under N2 atmosphere, is used to compare with the amorphous BiS x -modified TiO2 photocatalyst. From the XRD pattern in the inset of Fig. 8A, it is clear that the characteristic peaks of Bi2S3 clearly appear, indicating that amorphous BiS x nanodots have conversed into crystalline Bi2S3 particles by high-temperature calcination [52,53]. Moreover, the photocatalytic hydrogen-generation performance of BiS x /TiO2(5.0 wt%) photocatalyst is significantly greater than that of c-Bi2S3/TiO2(5.0 wt%) (Fig. 8B and Table 1). According to the above result, the amorphous BiS x -modified TiO2 photocatalyst exhibits a markedly higher H2-production performance than the crystalline Bi2S3-modified TiO2. Therefore, it is very interesting to explore the photocatalytic H2-evolution mechanism of amorphous BiS x nanodots-modified TiO2 and the possible mechanism is proposed in Fig. 9. For convenient comparison, the (012) surface of Bi2S3 is selected as an example due to the coexistence of Bi and S sites, as displayed in Fig. 9A-a and b. In this case, the S sites are responsible for the superior interfacial H2-production reaction due to their strong adsorption of H atoms (Fig. 9A-c). When the TiO2 is irradiated by ultraviolet light, the photoexcited electrons are stimulated to the CB (−0.29 eV) of TiO2 (Fig. S2-C) according to its wide bandgap (E g = 3.13 eV) (Fig. S2-A and B). Subsequently, the photogenerated electrons can be easily migrated to the CB (−0.09 eV) of the bismuth sulfide [32] and further reduce the H+ ions to H2 by the interfacial hydrogen-evolution reaction (Fig.S2-C) due to the lower CB position of Bi2S3. As for crystalline Bi2S3 cocatalyst, the unsaturated S atoms act as the efficient H+-adsorbed active sites (Fig. 9B-a). As for amorphous BiS x nanodots, their high dispensability and small size can expose more unsaturated S atoms for more effectively adsorbing H+ ions from the solution to be reduced by the photogenerated electrons than the crystalline Bi2S3 (Fig. 9B-b). Therefore, the above analysis evidently manifests that the amorphous BiS x nanodots can expose more unsaturated S atoms as active centers in favor of hydrogen evolution. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra and photoelectrochemical tests are measured to prove the photocatalytic mechanism of the amorphous BiS x nanodots as efficient cocatalysts for the improved H2-generation efficiency of TiO2 [54]. The Fig. 10A shows the TRPL spectra and fitted parameters of the BiS x /TiO2 photocatalysts. Clearly, the average fluorescent life (τave= 7.63 ns) of BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%) is shorter than that of the bare TiO2 (τave= 8.10 ns), strongly indicating that a faster interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 to amorphous BiS x nanodots, resulting in the boosted hydrogen-production performance [55,56]. The Fig. 10B and Fig. 10C display the polarization curves and EIS plots for the bare TiO2 and BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%). It is obviously found that the BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%) material exhibits a lower overpotential in dark and a smaller radius in comparison with the blank TiO2, implying that the amorphous BiS x nanodots can play as the high-efficiency active center to accelerate the carrier migration and ultimately facilitate the interfacial hydrogen-evolution reaction of TiO2 [57,58]. Therefore, it can be strongly demonstrated that the amorphous BiS x nanodots can efficiently migrate photogenerated electrons and finally facilitate the photocatalytic performance of TiO2. According to the above analysis, the amorphous BiS x can work as an effective cocatalyst to notably improve the H2-evolution efficiency of TiO2. It is greatly significant to explore the effect of amorphous BiS x nanodots on other photocatalytic materials. As a result, typical semiconductor materials (such as g-C3N4 and CdS) are also loaded by the amorphous BiS x nanodots with a similar synthesis method to the BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%). In addition, the optical absorption property and their corresponding photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 and CdS before and after BiS x modification are measured, as shown in Fig. 11A and B. The UV–vis absorption spectra prove that both the absorption intensity of the g-C3N4 and CdS photocatalysts are remarkably boosted in the visible region after the modification of amorphous BiS x nanodots. And the corresponding pictures are noticeably changed from yellow to gray and orange to brown, respectively. Meanwhile, the absorption edges have no obviously changed, forcefully suggesting that the amorphous BiS x nanodots are only loaded on the surface of g-C3N4 and CdS. More importantly, it can be seen from the inset of Fig. 11, the H2-evolution performance of the BiS x /g-C3N4(1.0 wt%) and BiS x /CdS(1.0 wt%) are remarkably enhanced by 9.6 and 8.5 times in comparison with the pure g-C3N4 and CdS, respectively. Based on the above analysis, clearly indicating that the amorphous BiS x nanodots can be acted as an effectively versatile cocatalyst modified on the surface of photocatalysts for improving the hydrogen-evolution performance."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, the amorphous BiS x nanodots with the size of 0.5–2 nm are successfully and homogeneously decorated on the TiO2 to form the BiS x /TiO2 via a two-step strategy, including the adsorption of the Bi(Ш)-EDTA ion on TiO2 and the in-situ formation of amorphous BiS x nanodots. In comparison to blank TiO2, the BiS x /TiO2 photocatalysts exhibited a remarkably enhanced hydrogen-production activity. In particular, the BiS x /TiO2(1.0 wt%) photocatalyst achieved the greatest photocatalytic H2-production performance (803.2 μmol h−1 g−1, AQE= 3.86%), which is 83.6 folds of the blank TiO2. Furthermore, the amorphous BiS x nanodots can serve as a general cocatalyst to boost the H2-generation efficiency of other typical photocatalysts (g-C3N4 and CdS). Based on the experimental results, a boosted photocatalytic H2-production mechanism of amorphous BiS x is proposed, where the amorphous BiS x nanodots can expose more unsaturated active S atoms as the effectual H2-evolution active centers and then facilitate the direct formation of hydrogen. The work can provide a new insight for designing novel metal sulfide cocatalysts for potential applications."
