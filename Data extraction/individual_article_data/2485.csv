0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been considered to be an ideal energy for the future. Biological hydrogen production using fermentative and photosynthetic bacteria from wastes has recently attracted considerable attention as a promising way of converting organic wastes to hydrogen (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; van Ginkel et al., 2001). A two-step process coupling fermentative bacteria with photosynthetic bacteria not only produces hydrogen, but also treats wastes effectively (Chen and Lin, 2003). Organic waste is converted to hydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) by fermentative bacteria in the first reactor, and the VFAs are further converted to hydrogen by photosynthetic bacteria in the second reactor (Miyake et al., 1984; Zheng and Yu, 2004). During the acidogenesis of organic wastes, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, VFAs, and sometimes alcohols, are simultaneously produced (Lee et al., 2002). The VFAs can be stimulatory, inhibitory or even toxic to the fermentative bacteria depending on their concentrations (Stewart, 1975). A low level of VFAs may have no effect or a stimulatory effect on hydrogen production. However, at a high level, VFAs can lead to severe inhibition on hydrogen fermentation. The effects of VFAs on the fermentative bacteria are associated with the solution pH values. It is presumed that the VFAs in their undissociated forms can freely permeate the bacteria cell membrane (Gottschalk, 1986). If the undissociated VFAs are pumped into the culture, they will penetrate the plasma membrane and dissociate depending on the pH inside cell (Gottschalk, 1986). Thus, the pH inside the cell will be lowered. To prevent unfavorable physiological conditions within the bacteria cell, excess energy must be used to pump ions, e.g. potassium ions, from the culture. Therefore, the energy used for bacteria growth is reduced and the bacteria growth rate will be lowered (Zoetemeyer et al., 1982). On the other hand, if a high level of dissociated VFAs is present in the culture, the ionic strength in solution will increase. Such an increase can result in cell lysis. As a result, the inhibitory effect will occur (Niel et al., 2003). So far, however, little information is available regarding the inhibitory effect of VFAs on hydrogen fermentation in the literature. During the hydrogen fermentation from organic wastes, acetate, propionate and butyrate are usually main aqueous products (Noike and Mizuno, 2000; Okamoto et al., 2000; Lay, 2001). Excess production of VFAs might result in an inhibitory effect on the hydrogen fermentation. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the influence of butyrate, one of the main VFAs, on the hydrogen production. Glucose was used as the sole substrate, a heat-treated anaerobic sludge was employed as the seed sludge."
1,Experimental,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge The anaerobic microflora used in this study was heat-treated anaerobic sludge. This seed sludge was originally obtained from a local municipal sewage treatment plant and was anaerobically stored at ambient temperatures for 6 months. Prior to use, the sludge was sieved to remove stone, sand and other coarse matters. Thereafter, the sludge was heated at 85°C for an hour to inactivate the hydrogentrophic methanogens and to enrich the hydrogen-producing bacteria."
3,Batch tests,"2.2 Batch tests Batch tests were conducted with 300-ml serum vials in duplicate. Six vials were, respectively, dosed with sodium butyrate of 4.18, 6.27, 8.36, 12.54, 16.72, 25.08g/l, while the seventh vial was served as a control without butyrate. Glucose was used as the sole carbon source at a fixed concentration of 10.0g/l. Each vial was seeded with 10-ml seed sludge and a 1-ml nutrient solution. The nutrient solution contained (per liter water) 50g NH4Cl, 25g KH2PO4, 25g K2HPO4, 12.5g MgCl2·6H2O, 50mg NiCl2·6H2O, 10mg CaCl2, 20mg KCl, 50mg (NH4)6Mo7O24, 50mg CoCl2·6H2O, 50mg MnCl2·4H2O, 50mg ZnSO4·7H2O and 50mg CuSO4·5H2O. The vials were then filled to 100ml with deionized water and buffer solution of 5.82g/l H2PO4 − and 5.76g/l HPO4 2−. The pH was adjusted at 6.0 by adding 4M NaOH or 2M HCl. Prior to test, the serum vials were purged with nitrogen gas for 3min to ensure anaerobic conditions and were then tied down with plastic fasteners. After that, vials were placed in a shaking water bath. The temperature and rotational speed of the shaking bath were controlled at 37°C and 150rpm, respectively. The biogas production was sampled at pre-determined intervals using syringes according to the Owen approach (Owen et al., 1979). At the beginning and the conclusion of each test, the composition of biogas, VFAs and alcohols, were measured."
4,Analyses,"2.3 Analyses Glucose was measured by using anthrone–sulfuric acid method (Dubois et al., 1956). Liquor samples of 1.0ml were withdrawn at regular intervals. Half of the sample was diluted with deionized water for determination of glucose concentration, while another half was used to determine the levels of VFAs and alcohols. The volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to the Standard Methods (APHA, AWWA and WEF, 1995). The composition of biogas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Lunan, Model SP-6800A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2m stainless column packed with 5Å molecular sieve. The temperatures of injector, column and detector were kept at 100, 60 and 105°C, respectively. Argon was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. Gas samples of 1.0ml were taken from the vials and used to determine the contents of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane. Hydrogen gas production was calculated from the headspace measurements and the total volume of biogas produced for each time interval using the mass balance equation (1) V H , i = V H , i − 1 + C H , i ( V G , i − V G , i − 1 ) + V H ( C H , i − C H , i − 1 ) where V H, i and V H, i−1 are the cumulative hydrogen gas volumes at the current (i) and previous time interval (i−1), respectively; V G, i and V G, i−1 and total biogas volume at the current and previous time intervals; C H, i and C H, i−1 are the fraction of hydrogen gas in the headspace at the current and previous time intervals; V H is the volume of headspace of vials (200ml). The removed biogas volume for analysis was also taken into account during hydrogen mass balance. The concentrations of the VFAs and alcohols in the liquor were determined by a second gas chromatograph (Agilent, Model 6890NT) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm fused-silica capillary column (DB-FFAP). The VFAs and alcohols analyzed included acetate, propionate, butyrate, i-butyrate, valerate, caproate, ethanol and propanol. The liquor samples were first centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 5min, and were then acidified by formic acid and filtrated through 0.2μm membrane and finally measured for free acids. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 250 and 300°C, respectively. The initial temperature of oven was 70°C for 3min followed with a ramp of 20°C/min for 5.5min and to final temperature of 180°C for 3min. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 2.6ml/min."
5,Inhibition model,"2.4 Inhibition model A modified Monod model was adapted to describe the non-competitive inhibitory effect of butyrate addition on the hydrogen production rate (Han and Levenspiel, 1988; Niel et al., 2003): (2) r = r max ( 1 − C C crit ) n ( S S + K S ) where r is the H2 production rate (ml/g-VSS/h); r max is the maximum H2 production rate (ml/g-VSS/h); C is the added butyrate concentration (g/l); C crit is the critical added butyrate concentration at which H2 production ceases (g/l); K S is the apparent half-velocity constant for glucose (g/l); S is the substrate concentration (g/l); and n is the degree of inhibition. For cases where the glucose concentration was not the limiting (S≫K S), Eq. (2) could be simplified to the following: (3) r = r max ( 1 − C C crit ) n Values of parameters r max, C crit and n were non-linearly evaluated using the function of ‘Microsoft Origin 6.1’ by converting the residual sum of squares between the experiment and the estimation to a minimum value."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Glucose degradation,"3.1 Glucose degradation In all the vials, no further glucose consumption or hydrogen production occurred after 60-h incubation. As shown in Fig. 1 , glucose degradation was greatly influenced by the butyrate dosage. With an increase in added butyrate concentration, glucose degradation rate gradually decreased. Compared with the control, addition of butyrate at 4.18–6.27g/l slightly delayed the glucose degradation. Middle levels of butyrate at 8.36–16.72g/l moderately inhibited the glucose degradation. A further increase in butyrate concentration to 25.08g/l resulted in a severe inhibition to glucose degradation. The glucose degradation efficiency was also greatly influenced by the added butyrate concentration (Fig. 2 ). At 0–12.54g/l of added butyrate, the glucose degradation efficiencies fell in a narrow range of 97–98%, similar to that of the control. However, at addition of butyrate at 25.08g/l, the glucose degradation was reduced to 36% only. This indicates that the addition of butyrate at a high level had a significant negative influence on glucose degradation efficiency. Inhibition of glucose degradation by the addition of butyrate resulted in changes of final pH values in the vials, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Due to the accumulation of VFAs during glucose fermentation, the pH value generally decreased despite of the presence of buffer solution. Since all vials had a final pH of greater than 5.25, this pH range did not inhibit hydrogen production (Lee et al., 2002). As shown in Fig. 2, with an increase in added butyrate concentration, the final pH value increased. The reason for this is that the production of VFAs was reduced with the increase in added butyrate."
8,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production With the degradation of glucose, both hydrogen and carbon dioxide were produced as the gaseous products, whereas no methane could be detected. As shown in Fig. 3 , the addition of butyrate had a considerable effect on the cumulative hydrogen production. Compared with the control, addition of butyrate at 4.18g/l enhanced the hydrogen production. However, at 6.27–12.54g/l, addition of butyrate moderately inhibited the hydrogen production. A further increase in added butyrate concentration to 25.08g/l severely inhibited the hydrogen production. The inhibition degree substantially increased with the added butyrate concentration. Table 1 summarizes the effect of added butyrate concentration on the specific hydrogen production rates and hydrogen yields. The specific hydrogen production rate could be estimated by dividing the maximum hydrogen production rate by the biomass concentration, whereas the hydrogen yield could be calculated by dividing the volume of produced hydrogen by the amount of consumed glucose. The specific hydrogen production rate gradually decreased as the added butyrate concentration increased from 0 to 25.08g/l. Due to the severe inhibition, the specific hydrogen production rate at 25.08g/l of added butyrate was 7.7ml/g-VSS/h only, much lower than that of the control (61.8ml/g-VSS/h). This was coinciding with the low glucose degradation efficiency at 25.08g/l of added butyrate. The change of hydrogen yield was in the same trends to that of specific hydrogen production rate. The hydrogen yield decreased with the increase in added butyrate concentration, from 1.85mol-H2/mol-glucose at 4.18g/l of added butyrate to 0.32mol-H2/mol-glucose at 25.08g/l. As shown in Table 1, the partial pressures of hydrogen in biogas also decreased with the increase in added butyrate concentration, from 0.40atm at 4.18g/l of added butyrate to 0.16atm at 25.08g/l. These results demonstrate that addition of butyrate had a negative effect on the hydrogen production in the acidogenesis of glucose."
9,Distribution of aqueous products,"3.3 Distribution of aqueous products During the fermentation of glucose, VFAs and alcohols were simultaneously produced as aqueous products. Table 2 summarizes the distribution of VFAs at various butyrate dosages. In the control, acetate and butyrate were the main products, together accounting for 90% of total VFAs, whereas propionate, valerate, caproate and ethanol were also present, but in relatively lower quantities. With the addition of butyrate up to 16.72g/l, acetate concentration remained almost constant. The concentrations of propionate and ethanol both increased, which was accompanied by an increased production of higher VFAs such as valerate and caproate. Butyrate production was severely inhibited by the addition of butyrate at 12.54–25.08g/l. Even at 25.08g/l of added butyrate, only 0.51g/l butyrate was produced from the vial, much lower than that of the control (2.22g/l). This suggests that the addition of butyrate significantly altered the fermentation patterns of glucose. During hydrogen fermentation, the glucose was converted to VFAs, alcohols, biomass, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and biomass. The substrate COD was calculated from the added concentration of glucose, assuming that glucose is completely converted to water and carbon dioxide. The COD of fermentative products and residual glucose were all calculated from the measured concentrations at the conclusion of fermentation. The COD of biomass was calculated from the measured VSS concentration, assuming that the chemical formula of biomass is C5H7NO2 and each gram of VSS is equivalent to 1.42g of COD (Grady et al., 1999). The calculated COD recoveries at various butyrate dosages are listed in Table 3 . The overall COD recoveries were 80% for the cases of 12.54 and 16.76g/l of added butyrate concentration, whereas the COD recoveries were around 100% for the other cases. The reasons for the low COD recoveries for the two cases are unknown."
10,Inhibition modeling,"3.4 Inhibition modeling In order to find out the effect of added butyrate on hydrogen production, the specific hydrogen production was plotted against total butyrate concentration (butyrate produced plus butyrate added). The relationship between the specific hydrogen production rate and butyrate concentration was established by using the non-competitive inhibition model (Eq. (3)). From the regression analysis shown in Fig. 4 , the values of inhibitory parameters were obtained as r max of 61.5ml/g-VSS/h, C crit of 25.6g/l, and n of 0.337. The high value of regression coefficients, 0.989, suggest that the inhibition model above is able to properly describe the inhibitory effect of butyrate addition on hydrogen production. The relative activity is usually used to quantify the inhibition caused by an inhibitor (Yu and Fang, 2001). As illustrated in Fig. 5 , the bioactivities of hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield relative to the control were plotted against added butyrate concentration. In general, the inhibition of bioactivity increased with the added butyrate concentration. The inhibition can thus be expressed by a simple index C I,50, representing the added butyrate concentration at which bioactivity was reduced by 50% (Yu and Fang, 2001). From Fig. 5, the C I,50 values of added butyrate concentration on hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield were estimated as 19.39 and 20.78g/l, respectively."
11,Conclusions,"The addition of butyrate had an inhibitory effect on hydrogen production from acidogenesis of glucose by mixed anaerobic cultures. At dosages of 4.18 and 6.27g/l, addition of butyrate only slightly inhibited hydrogen production, whereas the addition of butyrate at 8.36–12.54g/l imposed a moderate inhibitory effect on hydrogen production. An addition of 25.08g/l, butyrate exhibited a strong inhibitory influence on both substrate degradation and hydrogen production. The distribution of the VFAs was significantly influenced by the addition of butyrate. The inhibition of added butyrate on hydrogen production was well described by a non-competitive and non-linear inhibition model, with the maximum hydrogen production rate of 59.3ml/g-VSS/h, critical added butyrate concentration of 25.1g/l, and inhibition degree of 0.323, respectively. The C I,50 values of added butyrate concentration on hydrogen production rate and yield were estimated as 19.39 and 20.78g/l, respectively."
