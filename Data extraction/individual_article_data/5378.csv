0,Introduction,"Energy is a contemporary context in our every day needs. The growth of compression ignition (CI) engine is rapid due to high energy demands. CI is the most efficient prime mover in transportation and heavy industrial inventions. On the contrary, CI engine mostly depends on fossil fuels. Depletion of petroleum source enforces researchers to find alternate energy source with high performance and less emission. Few studies revealed that at 2050 the demand of global energy will be hectic and expected to rise up to 57% from the current scenario. Some notable study visualized at the year of 2035, an extra 1.6 billion people will stipulate energy [1]. On the other hand, pollution is believed to be a major problem in continuing the usage of fossil fuels. During burning the fossils fuel harmful exhaust gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons are emitted extensively. Thus pioneers are forced to find a new energy which is very clean and has green technology due to stringent emission protocols. From the years of research few inventions declared that hydrogen can be a powerful alternate source [2]. It is apparent that, hydrogen fuel is one of superlative renewable form of energy which is eco-friendly for energy generation process. Thereby hydrogen believed to be a green and eco-friendly energy [3]. Thus it attracts appealing audience in the field of energy. Indeed, hydrogen can be easily converted to useful energy using internal combustion (IC) engines and fuel cells. Having that in mind, many research continued in fuel cells [4]. In fact, the use of hydrogen in diesel engine is not as convenient as SI engine and it can be overcomed by achieving wide engine operation. The above ambivalence can be neglected by using hydrogen in the form of blends with diesel fuel [5]. Another key reason for implementation of hydrogen in CI engine is the suitability of biodiesel. Usage of biofuel in diesel requires a lesser amount of modification than gasoline engine. Recently several studies had been performed on hydrogen as a fuel and delivers a positive result than other resources. In diesel engine, the use of neat hydrogen shows high thermal efficiency than other fuels under same conditions. However the emission of NOx is higher. This thrive the scientific community to introduce new technologies to reduce emission [6]. Firstly, Gopal et al. came up with the dual mode combustion technique and it was very successful. Addition of hydrogen in diesel improved the performance without any fatal damage [3]. Karagon et al. reported addition of hydrogen increases the brake thermal efficiency by increasing heat release rate and pressure. In contrast, NOx emission is significantly futile at higher load compared minimum load condition [7]. Although hydrogen produces higher brake thermal efficiency, the usage of hydrogen on diesel engine directly is challenging due to its high ignition temperature (576 °C) [8]. The above drawback was eliminated by Ikegamali et al. by introducing glow plug [9]. On the other hand, Antunes et al. [10] used hydrogen directly in diesel engine with the help of high pressure gas injector. Further, the addition of hydrogen generates the productive result such as increased power output, high thermal efficiency and assuages NOx emission. The evolution of technology like glow plug, heating intake air and gas injector makes the equipment complicated, this impediment can be minimised by using hydrogen in small fraction. Although hydrogen produces a better result, implementation of them in local fuel market is esoteric. The storage and the transportation of hydrogen were not easy as fossil fuels because of its high diffusivity, low density and flammability similar to low molecular weight alcohols. Despite these unique properties, hydrogen is stored and transported in form of pressurized gas or cryogenic liquid. Fan Zang et al. carried out an overall survey on hydrogen storage system and its production from renewable sources such as water, natural gas and photolytic process [11]. Currently, the world is producing nearly 50 million tons every year for the industrial needs. Dincer et al. proposed 11 methods to produce hydrogen such as water electrolysis, high temperature steam electrolysis, biophotolysis, photocatalysis, theromoloysis, thermocatalytic cracking, thermochemical and electrochemical water spillting, gasification, anaerobic digestion and reforming [12]. In spite of 11 methods, the reforming, gasification and partial oxidation are three typical methods used to produce hydrogen from fossil fuels. Similar to the production of hydrogen, storage is an important component in hydrogen market. Hydrogen fuel is very difficult to store as it required high care and cost since it has high gravimetric density and low volumetric density. There are three basic modes to store hydrogen such as compressed gas, cryogenic and material based substance. Regardless of three, the compressed gas was widely used technique to store the hydrogen. The hydrogen can be stored in the cylinder in compressed form up to 700 bar pressure. Due to the major inventions several hydrogen refuelling stations are established worldwide. At year of 2010, 80% of station uses stationary compressed gaseous storage method. The major concern of storing hydrogen in high pressure is volumetric density [13,14]. A decade ago, Satyapal et al. proposed two methods to store hydrogen with better gravimetric and volumetric density such as cryo compressed tanks and conformable tanks [15]. The above feasibility agitated the pioneers to test the hydrogen blends in automobile engines abundantly. Szwaja et al. [16] tested the hydrogen fuel in the CI engine along with the diesel fuel using co combustion. They tested hydrogen with diesel at small fraction about 5%. Applying hydrogen as extra fuel improved combustion and reduces the knocking effect. The above study stimulated Kose and anivic [17] to demonstrate the experiment on direct injection diesel engine with hydrogen ratio of 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% respectively. They feign the emissions of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are reduced by adding hydrogen. In contrast no significant change in NOx (oxides of nitrogen) is recorded. The similar type of results were witnessed by Bari and Esmaeil [18]. They tested the effect of hydrogen and oxygen as blends in four cylinder water cooled diesel engine. From the test results it is understood that addition of hydrogen reduces HC, CO and CO2 with higher NOx. The major reason for the hydrogen to yield reduced emission of HC, CO and CO2 is quenching. The quenching distance of the hydrogen was shorter than other fuels and eventually it doesn’t carry any carbon atoms in its composition [19]. Moreover reduction of NOx gained attention among pioneers. From the years of research, notable works proved implementation of EGR [20] and fuel additives in the diesel engine reduces the NOx significantly [21–23]. EGR reduces the NOx by recirculation technique by reducing the combustion gas temperature and achieving high combustion rate for the supplied fuel. Few prominent works had proved that, EGR is an effective way to reduce emission, especially NOx. Recently, Manigandan et al., tested hydrogen at various EGR of 5%, 10% and 20% for reducing the emission. They observed increased BTE and reduced emission for 20% EGR compared to other fraction ratio. Saravana and Natarj [24] tested the addition of H2 in direct injection single cylinder engine. The test was performed at various ratios of 15% and 25%. The apparent results were positive for instance high BTE with less emission. Eventually they also witnessed a slight reduction in performance owing to the dilution of intake charge and EGR. It’s quite typical that, they observed 21% reduced NOx and 50% reduced soot. Koder et al. estimated the NOx emission by introducing cooled EGR in common rail diesel engine, 25% of reduction of NOx was reported with appealing improvement in BTE. From this it is indeed obvious that, the use hydrogen with EGR is a better strategy for reducing emission [25]. Simultaneously to EGR, the usage of fuel additives also gained welcome attention among authors which is intended to reduce NOx with improved BT. Advanced nanotechnology is used to enable the production of nanoparticles with better property. The usage of nanoparticles in fuel helps to improve BTE due to large surface area to volume ratio [25]. This leads many pioneers to use fuel additives in diesel hydrogen powered engine. Annamalai et al. used ceria nanoparticles to control emission [26]. They found that, ceria nanoparticle blended emulsified biofuel decreases the freezing point of fuel with improved cetane number. In addition they reported reduced viscosity and flash point. The emission of CO and HC were reduced to appreciable level. Followed by the above regard, Vigneswaran et al. demonstrated the water emission in diesel engine fuel with nanoparticles. The addition of nanoparticles increases the combustion with retarded emission [27]. Subsequently, Ramalingam et al., investigated the anti oxidant additive on Borassus Flabellifer blend to achieve reduced emission and slightly improved BTE [28]. Followed by the above, Tewari el al used multiwall carbon nanotubes to reduced NOx without compromising the performance results [29]. Slowly, the CNT gained the lime light of the pioneers to reduce NOx without compromising performance. The coinciding study carried out by Hosseini et al. to analyse the effect of CNT at different fractions of 5% and 20% respectively [30]. They carried the same results as Tewari et al. They reported reduced OH, HC and soot emission. Saraee et al. used fuel additives in biofuel and author witnessed detonating reduction of HC, NOx and Soot. This is mainly due to the latent heat and the effect of CeO2 [31]. The test was carried out in CeO2 at different fraction of 10, 20 and 40 pm. In addition Grisel corro et al. [32] intruded to study the nitrogen adsorption and soot oxidation. The CeO2 acts as a active catalyst which leads to reduction of soot formation. Further, 3% of Ag/CeO2 act as oxygen buffer. Ozgur et al. [33] conducted experiments in nanoparticles such as Al2O3, MgO, TiO2, ZnO, SiO2, Fe2O3, NiO and NiFeO3 at different dispersion of 25 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm. The outcomes of the results are satisfactory upon addition of nanoparticles to the neat diesel fuel. Although a nanoparticle reduces the emission with high performance, the usage of them is challenging due to suspension stability [34,35]. Moreover addition of nanoparticles at high fractions reduces the overall calorific value of the fuel which affects the combustion indeed owing to stability of blends. The UV-V is spectrophotometer was used to avoid stability issues. Recently, Abdulkadir Yaşar et al. [48] observed the bi metallic additives are reducing vibration and noise significantly. Further, they recorded lower emission upon addition of TiO2, Cu(NO3)2 and Ce(CH3CO2)3·H2O Compared to all particles, cerium acteate hydrate reduces the exhaust emission incredibly. Furthermore, they revealed the SPL of the engine decreased owing to the introduction of nanoparticles. Ali Keskin et al. [49] synthesised the metal based additives to enhance the performance and reduce the emission. The additives acetylferrocene and palladium are blended with the diesel at 25 ppm. Although CO and PM emissions are decreased appreciably, besides the NOx emission at higher loads are not very compromising. However, the SPL and vibration accelerations decreased notably. The notable literature comparison is shown in Table 1 . Besides the combustion and emission of neat biodiesel, the role of nanoparticles and their effects of performance and emission are mandatory. To fill the research gap, few works done on IC engine with dual mode ignition. Although there are several notable works available on hydrogen as fuel in diesel engine, however usage of nanoparticles and estimation of absorption ratio is very limited as to the author knowledge. To meet this technology gap, this work finds the effect of nanoparticles in combustion and emission. In addition, absorption ratio effects are also analyzed. The nanoparticles TiO2, CNT, Al2O3, CuO and CeO2 dispersed with 20% hydrogen at 100 ppm concentration. The fuel is tested at different engine load 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% at constant speed engine."
1,Materials and methods,"This section clearly describes the details of nanoparticles, biodiesel blends preparation, estimation of the test fuels and experimental setup details."
2,Test fuel preparation,"2.1 Test fuel preparation A nanoparticles possesses better property owing to large surface area to volume ratio. The size of nanoparticles TiO2, CNT, Al2O3, CuO and CeO2 used in this study is 30–50 nm, 50 nm, 25–35 nm, 40 nm and 30–50 nm respectively. The blends are prepared are synthesized according to the weight ratio. The raw hydrogen was procured from the local reserve in Chennai, India. The diesel was bought from local petroleum station and the nanoparticles from light mach composites pvt ltd, India. All the nanoparticles are diffused in the solvent using the ultrasonication and magnetic stirring process. The surface modification was done for all nanoparticles owing to its high surface area. Higher the surface area lowers the stability of the fuel blends. In order to avoid that, surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonia bromide is added to the diesel during the dispersion of nanoparticles at the sonication frequency of 24 kHz with the proportion of 100 ppm [36]. The process repeated at least 45 min to ensure the dispersion of nanoparticles in fuel blends were very compromising. All procedures are done based on the ASTM characterisation. The properties of test fuels placed in the Table 3. The nanoparticle CNT does not alter the fuel properties but it change calorific value owing to high carbon content. Moreover, HCE100 shows reduced density with no change in calorific value compared to diesel fuel. All nanoparticles are tested at constant concentration. Nithya et al. [37] proved nanoparticles are stable when the particle size is constant. The stability of nanoparticles based on the concentration found by absorbance ratio (A/A0), where A0 is the initial absorbance and A is the final absorbance of the blends. The absorbance ratio for all blends for a sedimentation time is shown in Fig. 3. The blends HCT100 and HA100 are highly stable with the 30% and 27% at the end of 220 h of sedimentation time. On the contrary, the blends HCT100 is least stable, the similar trend is seen by Chen et al. Further, the stability can be increased by introduction of catalyst such as CNT [38] and Ce2O3 [39]. Addition of these catalysts has an ability to generate high stability with less activation energy. The test fuels obtained from the above procedure are listed as HT100 (Diesel 0.78 kg + Hydrogen 0.2Kg + 0.02 kg of TiO2), HCT100 (Diesel 0.78 kg + Hydrogen 0.2Kg + 0.02 kg of CNT), HA100 (Diesel 0.78 kg + Hydrogen 0.2Kg + 0.02 kg of Al2O3), HC100 (Diesel 0.78 kg + Hydrogen 0.2Kg + 0.02 kg of CuO), HCE100 (Diesel 0.78 kg + Hydrogen 0.2Kg + 0.02 kg of CeO2)."
3,Test engine and instrumentation,"2.2 Test engine and instrumentation The modified engine setup incorporated with dual injection system, direct injection for hydrogen and port injection for gasoline. Gopal et al. [3] already proved dual-fuel operation with hydrogen is possible and satisfactory. The experimental system and schematic layout is shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . Table 2 provides the main specifications of the engine. Subsequently, the Tables 3 and 4 shows the properties of the fuel hydrogen and fuel blended with nanoparticles. The hydrogen is blended with the gasoline and TiO2 using ultrasonication process. Fig. 4 reported the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) of the various nanoparticles. An intake manifold was installed to inject gasoline into cylinders. The electronic control unit (ECU) system used to control the spark plug, fuel consumption and exhaust gases measurement [25]. It is connected to the PC to record and monitor the output data. AVL DiGas exhaust gas analyzer was used to imprint the emission of gasses like HC, CO, CO2 and NOx [40]. Simultaneously, the EGT (Exhaust gas temperature) was also measured. A series of the port is connected to AVL gas analyzer to PC to monitor the changes in emission and gas temperature. The flow meter is used to measure the specific fuel consumption. The stagnation pressure and stagnation temperature is calculated using Pitot tube and the thermocouple. The 0.5 mm diameter K-type of the thermocouple was used to measure the temperature at different locations. The national instruments data acquisition system 6218 DAS were used to collect the parameters like inlet temperature, outlet temperature, inlet and outlet pressure, turbine pressure at different locations, pressure and temperature at the nozzle exit. The setup uses a premix combustor to yield less emission at full power during the operation. Further, the pressure transducer AVL-GUBZ is used to obtain cylinder pressure. Kistel 2614B is used to measure the crank angle. Further, DMF11AB, ONODF2420, CU160 and LA4 used to monitor the mass flow, gasoline, engine rpm and excess air ratio respectively [41]. The angle between the injector and spark plug is 65°. The uncertainties of all the equipments are ensured below 3% [40] listed in Table 5 ."
4,Uncertainty,"2.3 Uncertainty The errors are caused by several factors such as instrument error, measurement error, surrounding conditions, methodology of measurement and type of instrument. All set of reading repeated at least 4 cycles for each fuel. The detail analysis can be found in our previous studies Manigandan et al. (2018). The complete uncertainty is measures using the formula and listed in the Table 5. R is the resultant of all uncertainty during measurement [20] given by (1) R = R ( X 1 , X 2 ⋯ X n ) The partial derivative of the sensitivity [20] of result given by (2) U R R = X n ∂ R R ∂ X n 2 U X n 2 X n 2 From above equation uncertainly is measured and listed out in 44. The overall uncertainty of the system is found to be below ±5% which is in an up to standard range."
5,Results and discussion,"The listed fuel is tested at diesel engine at constant speed of 1800 rpm for various engine load. The results for combustion were plotted with respect to crank angle. The combustion and performance parameters such as BTE, BSFC and EGT are measured. In addition to the above, the emission of CO, CO2, HC and NOx is noted."
6,Combustion characteristics,"3.1 Combustion characteristics Fig. 5 shows the variation of cylinder pressure for all tested fuels from 30bTDC to 40aTDC at the 50% and 100% engine load respectively. All nanoparticles showed a little enhancement in cylinder pressure owing to shorter ignition delay and flame speed. Perhaps, addition of hydrogen is another reason for peak pressure due to early start of combustion [48]. Moreover, introduction of hydrogen in the diesel fuel increases the O and OH radicals. Another key thing to remember is combustion pressure. Combustion pressure is inversely proportional to compression pressure and thermal conductivity. The CNT recorded high pressure for both 50% and 100% load by generating peak pressure of 6.6 bar and 7.6 bar owing to its superior conducting property than other nanoparticles. The similar trend reported by Najafi [42]. Although the CNT produces high cylinder pressure despite that, the TiO2 put the decent value on the pressure by generating a pressure of 6.5 bar at partial load and 7.4 bar at full load condition which is 2.6% lower than CNT. The key reason for CNT and TiO2 to have steeper high cylinder pressure is larger heat spread in both compression and combustion. Furthermore it is obvious that, the high thermal conductivity and the addition of hydrogen were also the key reason. The maximum thermal conductivity of CNT 2000 W/m.K which is higher compared to all blends [38]. When the hydrogen is dispersed with the CNT, TiO2, CuO and Al2O3, the flame proportion is increases rapidly hence the combustion and pressure. Thereby increases in evaporation and temperature. On the contrary, Ce2O3 nanoparticle generates low pressure than other blends. Although diesel and HD20 has low kinematic viscosity and high calorific value, the cylinder pressure is significantly low as the engine load is increased. At full load condition, the fuel HCE100, HD20, and Diesel shows the maximum pressure of 6 bar, 6.7 bar and 6.2 bar respectively at 12aTDC. Fig. 6 depicts the heat release rate (HRR) for all tested fuels at three engine loads of 50%, 75% and 100%. HRR is a tool used to determine combustion analysis and incylinder combustion characteristics. At 100% engine load the HRR for Al2O3 and CuO is 47 J/CA and 45 J/CA, which is higher than both CNT and TiO2. The above trend is due to the shorter ignition delay and combustion deteriorating. Further, ignition delay depends on the cetane number, which eventually defines the quality of combustion. On the contrary, high cetane number may also increases the ignition delay time which leads to poor ignition. Hence choosing an adequate cetane number is vital [41]. The HRR for the fuel TiO2, CNT and Al2O3 is higher due to larger surface area and better atomization. Addition of hydrogen increases the heat release by 26% compared to the neat diesel. It can be further increased by addition of nanoparticles such as Al2O3 and CNT. All blends showed a dominating improvement in HRR than diesel owing to higher oxygen content which eventually increases the diffusion of combustion phase and hence decreasing the combustion duration."
7,Engine performance,"3.2 Engine performance The performance of the fuel can be measured using BSFC. The variation of BSFC for different nanoparticles represented in Fig. 7 . The BSFC of CNT is lower than other fuel due to high cylinder pressure and heat release rate. Despite above, another key reason is high calorific value than Al2O3 and other blends. The similar finding resulted by Sevron et al. The decent improvement in BSFC was witnessed for other fuels. At 25% of engine load, all blends showed 20% average reduction n BSFC which eventually decreased as the engine load is elevated. For instance, at 25% HT100, HCT100, HA100, HCE100, HC100 and HD20 reports 23.6%, 23.5%, 22.7%, 22.3% and 21.3% improved BSFC than diesel. On the contrary at 100% load, they reports only 7.5%, 7.5%, 7.4%,7.9%,7.2% and 7.2% reduction in BSFC respectively. Even though the change is not significant but it is a positive effect compared to diesel. At maximum load, the HCE100 showed a higher reduction in BSFC than other blends. The key reason is role of hydrogen in the fuel blends [43]. Addition of hydrogen increases the caloric value of all blends irrespective of the nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the high oxygen in the blends provides improved combustion which reduces the BSFC. Compared to all blends the CNT and TiO2 records noteworthy reduction in fuel consumption which resulted due to accelerated combustion, oxidation of carbon deposit in the engine cylinder and oxygen content in the blends. The carbon deposit is completed avoided by achieving high combustion and it is possible thorough addition nanoparticles to the neat diesel. It is clear that introduction of nanoparticles with hydrogen blend reduces the BSFC to significant levels, since the injector of the engine modified according to the hydrogen fuel. Similar pattern of results regarding the BSFC were witnessed by Manigandan et al. and Ali Keskin et al. Similar to BSFC, the series of test conducted to measure brake thermal efficiency (BTE). BTE shows the efficiency of the engine and the rate of combustion. It usually denotes the conversion rate of chemical energy to mechanical energy. Addition of nanoparticles increases the BTE in all blends as shown in Fig. 8 . At 25% of engine load, the HT100 shows 62% increase in BTE which drastically reduced at higher load. However, the blend HCT100 and HA100 improved the thermal efficiency irrespective of all engine loads. At 100% engine load, the blends HCT100, HA100, HCE100, and HC100 reported 1.2%, 2.5%, 4.3% and 1.2% improvement in BTE respectively. As far it concern, the BTE for HCE100 is 4.3% for 100% which is higher than other fuels owing to higher micro explosion of blends. Meanwhile HA100 also reported good improvement in BTE due to the oxygen buffer Al2O3. At high engine load, the reduction in BTE is seen for all blends. However, CNT reported prominent results than other test fuels. The main reason for that is higher calorific, as the volume of CNT increases the calorific value of the blend increased. Similar trend reported by few notable works. At maximum engine load the nanoparticles lose its strength thereby they show an adverse behaviour at higher loads. All blends records positive effects in BTE since, addition of nanoparticles improve the combustion characteristics by supplying adequate oxygen content to combustion chamber. For all test fuels the EGT increased with respect to augmented engine load. As the load elevated, the engine consumes more fuel to produce more torque. Fig. 9 presented high EGT at 0% engine load, which is due to the combustion of fuel in exhaust manifold instead of combustion chamber. Consequently, the EGT is reduced momentarily at 25% of engine load and increased to higher level as the load elevated. Among all blends, TiO2 showed higher EGT. TiO2 and CuO have high EGT since the heat release and calorific value is higher than other. Another key reason is long ignition delay of TiO2 blends. The longer ignition delay contributes to slower burn rate with high gas temperature at combustion chamber. This signifies the particles CNT and diesel blends have low temperature than TiO2 due to faster burn rate and short ignition delay. Although CNT has high calorific value they report 8% lower EGT than TiO2 due to the fast combustion. Faster combustion leads to slight decrease in exhaust gas temperature slightly before exiting the combustion chamber. On the other hand, the EGT at maximum load is almost close to diesel. The EGT for the fuel HCT100, HCT100, HA100, HCE100, and HC100 at full load conditions are 290 °C, 268 °C, 270 °C, 283 °C and 287 °C respectively. The EGT is increased 7% compared to diesel due to the influence of hydrogen in the fuel blends. As the load increased, the EGT of blends oscillates compared to diesel reduces due to the conversion of energy in to useful form of work. For instance, at 0% load the EGT for CNT is 3% is higher than diesel, as the load grew higher the difference between them increases to 8% and 7% at 25% and 50%. Further they reduced at the load of 75% and 100% to 6% and 3%. This denotes CNT converts the work into useful form of energy than other blends."
8,Exhaust gas emission,"3.3 Exhaust gas emission The end products of the combustion are undesirable emission. The gases are toxic and cause leverage harm to living things. Fig. 10 refers to the increase in carbon monoxide (CO) with engine load. CO is one of high toxic gases. The abnormal exposure of CO to the human body in the higher levels causes a fatal damage. The emission of CO for all blends is reduced notably across all engine loads. Increasing the oxygen content by addition of hydrogen and nanoparticle during combustion is a viable reason for reduction of CO emission. CNT showed a drastic reduction in CO emission compared to other blends due to the carbon content of CNT. However, at full load the blend TiO2 reports superior results than CNT. The ultimate reason for the TiO2 outperform at higher load is oxygen concentration in the fuel. On the contrary, other test fuels are not convincing due to increased oxygen deficiency rate during combustion process. To put in another way, the nanoparticles TiO2 and CNT has high surface area which improves combustion reaction which leads to lesser formation of CO. Similar observation was reported by Gunasekar et al. [38]. Similar to CNT and TiO2, Al2O3 also reports significant reduction in CO formation by achieving complete combustion thus preventing the growth of carbon deposit inside the combustion chamber [44]. In the other end, the blends like HD20, HC100 and HCE 100 does not show any significant reduction like TiO2, CNT or Al2O3. For instance at fully loaded condition, In addition to nanoparticles the addition of hydrogen are other reasons for improved combustion and decreased formation of CO compared to diesel. Similar observation is made by White et al. in terms of carbon monoxide. Fig. 11 represents the emission of CO2 for various loading condition. The average decrease in CO2 emission for all fuels HT100, HCT100, HA100, HCE100, HC100 and H20 were 7%, 6%, 7.6%, 6.7%, 7.9% and 9.8% respectively at full engine load condition compared to neat diesel. From figure it is evident that, as the load increased the formation CO2 is reduced drastically. For instance, the HCT100 reports 2% reduction in CO2 at 0% load, as the engine load increased to 100% the emission of CO2 is 3.8%. On the contrary, the HD20 and HC100 do not report significant reduction in CO2 irrespective of engine load. The reduced emission CO2 increases as the load elevated to higher levels for all blends owing to consequent combustion improvement. Not to mention its worthy enough compared with neat diesel. Compared to all blends CNT and TiO2 nanoparticles shows a profound decrease in CO2 emission rate owing to the high carbon content and oxygen content in the blends [43]. On the other side, Al2O3 nanoparticle does not show appealing reduction of CO2 like HCT100, however the slight reduction in emission is witnessed across all engine loads. Addition of nanoparticles increases the combustion which leads to high formation of CO2. This is restricted by addition of hydrogen as blends in the all test fuel [44]. Similar to TiO2, Ce3O2 acts as an oxygen buffer and it also burns off the carbon deposits inside the cylinder wall thus reducing the formation of CO2. Above all it seems, HCE100 generates 16% less CO2 than TiO2. Further, the Fig. 12 represents the HC emission for all tested fuels. All blends showed a reduction in HC compared to diesel fuel. The HC emission is dropped due to the high concentration of fuel. The maximum reduction of HC is observed by the nanoparticle CNT and TiO2 in all engine loads. Addition of carbon content on CNT and oxygen content in TiO2 accelerate combustion which lead to complete combustion, which results in less formation of hydrocarbons. Irrespective of all engine loads, the blends showed a incredible results by reducing the HC significantly. Perhaps this diminishing trend might be ascribed to the fact that, the dispersed additive improves combustion process due to high oxygen content and large surface area. It’s very fascinating to witness HC emission of the blends HCT100 and HT100 are very identical to one another across all engine loads. Similar to the CNT and TiO2, the Al2O3 and Ce2O3 showed a positive effect on reduced HC emission. Addition of Al2O3 enhances the level of oxygen content thus promoting the combustion process. Further, it also increases the surface area exposure which enhances the combustion. Another key fact to remember is introduction of Al2O3 increases the flame propagation speed and thus reduces the activation temperature of carbon incredibly [43]. CeO2 records lower HC by acting as the oxidation catalyst in reduction of carbon formation. All nanoparticles blends witness reduced NOx emission at low engine loads. On the contrary, as the load increases the NOx emission increased which is shown in Fig. 13 . The Al2O3 reported higher NOx emission due to rapid combustion process. Higher combustion promotes the formation of NOx. Further, the addition of Al2O3 increases the combustion temperature that leads to production of NOx at higher levels. Secondly, CNT nanoparticle reports lower NOx emission load at 50% engine load due to the radical reduction in combustion pressure. This is increased further at higher loads owing to complete combustion [45]. Similar to Al2O3, CuO and hydrogen blend also produces higher NOx compared to other blends since the ignition period is short. It obvious that, CeO2 acts as oxidation catalyst [40] which eventually promotes the combustion by reducing the NOx compared to TiO2. Nevertheless, CeO2 acts a oxygen buffer, it supplies the oxygen during oxidation, consequently decreases the formation of NOx [46]. Emission of NOx increases as the nanoparticle enhances the combustion which leads to higher temperature and consequently higher emission. This can be controlled by introducing the nanoparticle which acts a oxygen buffer, oxidation catalyst and carbon deposit remover [47]. As the engine load increased, reduction of NOx is witnessed for the blends HCT100 and HCE100. On the contrary, the formation of NOX increased for the fuels HC100, HA100 and HD20. Compared to all blends CNT and TiO2 emits 28% and 7% less NOx than neat diesel at 100% engine load. All blends showed a lesser formation of NOx at 25% engine load compared to other condition owing to gas temperature."
9,Research contributions,"3.4 Research contributions This study yields three main offerings, combustion, performance and emissions in energy consumptions. Preliminarily, the article attempts to find the effect of nanoparticles on the physiochemical properties of the neat diesel. In addition the consequence of nanoparticles size and surface area with the performance and emission of the engine were studied. By demonstrating that the existence of nanoparticles in diesel and hydrogen blends, this article confirms the significance increase in performance and combustion results. Furthermore, introduction of nanoparticles limited the production of harmful emissions of CO, CO2 and HC. Similarly the nitrogen oxide (NOx) discharge emission is controlled in compression ignition engine tests. This novel experimental evidence insists on the supposition that nanoparticles exhibits a distant superior surface area to volume quotient weighed against large particulates. The drive towards nanoparticle research is recently energized in fuel research as it is understood that nanoparticle will transform emission reduction and performance of combustion ignition engines. It is understood that nanoparticulate experimentation also induces innovation in the context of cost reduction as wastes are being attempted as substitutes to the relatively costly existing additive options. Consequently, additional research ought to consider incorporating cost elements into the research designs. Lastly, by revealing that hydrogen can be mixed with can neat diesel positively influence researchers’ direction on hydrogen hybridization with other biodiesel blends, and this paper uncovers the novel elements, which are of significance to emission control and performance enhancement. The result sheds new illumination on the research related to combustion ignition engine in an advanced turning regime in energy consumption studies by accounting for the consequences of NOx emission decline. In sum, our findings demonstrate a key idea: It is compelling for upcoming compression ignition engine and emission research to establish and concede the factors that may improve NOx emission decline and enhance the performance of the engine."
10,Conclusion,"In this work, the diesel engine is tested at various loads to investigate the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of four stoke engine fueled with the neat diesel, 20% of hydrogen and nanoparticle (TiO2, CNT, Al2O3, CeO2, and CuO). The UV-V is spectrophotometer used to quantify the stability of blends such as HT100, HCT100, HA100, HCE100, HC100 and HD20 over time. The results are summarised as follows. • The addition of nanoparticles does not considerably affect the physicochemical properties of the diesel blends. However slight change in viscosity, pour point, flash point and cetane number is noted. Moreover, the nanoparticle CNT is least stable than other blends. • All blends showed an enhanced cylinder pressure owing to the ignition delay. Specifically, CNT reported higher peak pressure of 6.6 bar and 7.6 bar at 50% and 100% engine load due to its significant conductivity property. • At low engine speed, CNT and TiO2 blends showed improved BSFC of 23% and 22% owing to its higher calorific value. As the load increased to 100%, BSFC dropped to 7.5% irrespective of the test fuels. • Due to shorter ignition delay, Al2O3 and CeO2 reports 2.5% and 4.3% improved BTE at 100% load. Meanwhile, the CNT reported only 1.2% higher BTE than diesel. • The EGT at 0% engine load is higher than 25% load; this is due to the combustion of gases in exhaust manifold instead of combustion chamber. As the engine load increased the EGT is elevated. Compared to all blends TiO2 reports 10% higher EGT. • TiO2 and CNT blends showed 75% and 66% reduced CO emission than diesel. Subsequently they also produce lesser CO2 production. All blends showed average reduction in CO and CO2 up to 40% and 30% respectively. • The emission of HC is significantly lower for the nanoparticle TiO2 and CNT up to 90% at full load condition. All blends showed a profound decrease in HC emission. • CNT blends showed a 33% reduction of NOx. Meanwhile Al2O3 and CuO generate 1.2 times higher NOx than diesel. Compared to all blends CNT and CeO2 reports less formation of NOx owing to oxidation and reduced carbon deposit. • Based on the combustion and emission results it is obvious that, addition of hydrogen can reduce the emission of CO, CO2 and HC to prominent levels without compromising the BSFC and BTE. However the NOx is increased owing to high combustion temperature. This can be eliminated by introduction of additives such as CNT and TiO2 in considerable levels."
