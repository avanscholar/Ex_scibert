0,Introduction,"Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymeric networks produced by introducing chemical or physical crosslinks in the structure [1]. Among various hydrogels, poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels have gained tremendous attention in the fields of soft robotics, tissue engineering, wound dressing and controlled drug delivery systems due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, nontoxicity, non-carcinogenic property, inherent water solubility and being environmentally friendly [1,2]. Hydrogel nanocomposites and hydrogel actuators(e.g. PNIPAM PVA/PDMAEMA-PSS hydrogels) can also be used to build shape-transforming materials, electromagnetic shielding, microfluidic devices, sensors in wearable electronics, biologic devices, thermal interface materials and shapeable hydrogel actuators [3–7]. Hydrogels can swell and de-swell in a reversible direction as well as showing viscoelastic behavior. However, they suffer from physical and mechanical weakness, low toughness and severe failure under intense stresses [3,8]. In recent years, different methods have been proposed to overcome these certain drawbacks of different hydrogels, nanocomposites and nanocomposite hydrogels including PVA based hydrogels, such as blending the neat hydrogels with proper polymers along with reinforcing and toughening them by a variety of organic or inorganic nanoparticles [9] as well as reinforcing with carbon fibers which not only enhance PVA based nanocomposite hydrogels, but also benefit with the reinforcement of a number of other nanocomposites including resin-based nanocomposites, laminated nanoomposites, thermoset nanocomposites, hybrid nanocomposites and cobalt-based nanocomposites. These materials can be employed in a variety of applications and fields such as electronic packaging base materials, aerospace industry, automotive industry, in marine and offshore area and electromagnetic wave absorption [10–16]. The toughening mechanisms of hydrogels, for instance, using bio-friendly toughening agents in combination with freeze-thawing route for PVA hydrogels has been reported [17] for applications such as tissue engineering and stretchable electronics which have been discussed in the literature [18,19]. PVA hydrogels can be cross-linked through diverse methods, e,g. introduction of chemical agents, freeze-thaw processes and electron beam [1,20,21]. The physically cross-linked PVA hydrogels formed by PVA-Borax chemistry have attracted attention and have been widely used in numerous applications, especially in medical fields, owing to their appropriate physiochemical properties [21]. The PVA-Borax method will help reinforcement of hydrogels through fabrication of fully-physically-linked nanocomposite hydrogels with a double-network structure and high crosslinking density [22]. Recently, graphene-based nanoparticles, especially graphene(Gr), graphene oxide (GO) and functionalized GO, have been considered as promising reinforcing agents to increase the mechanical properties of hydrogels. . In Gr based material, the tight bonding of Gr surface and the delocalized electrons provide excellent mechanical properties, charge mobility together with electrical conductivity [23]. However, due to high mechanical stiffness, enormous specific surface area, abundant functional groups, natural carrier mobility as well as thermal conductivity properties of GO and functionalized GO which benefit our purpose of research we opt to use functionalized GO [24]. There is no doubt that type, morphology, size, and content of particles also play a crucial role in final properties which affects selecting these materials for use [25]. Besides the functional groups of graphene oxide, the high aspect ratio and number of layers of GO nanoplatelets play an important role in altering mechanical properties of nanocomposite hydrogels [26]. Huang et al. [27] study on mechanical properties of boron-cross-linked graphene oxide(GO) hydrogels, demonstrates a significant increase in tensile strength, elongation at break together with compression and shear strength at low GO contents. The improvement in mechanical properties is attributed to the good dispersion of GO nanoplateltes along with strong linking of hydrogen bonds of the polymer chains and GO surface. Meanwhile, as expectedly, restacking and aggregation of nanoplatelets, may hinder full utilization of GO potentials. Surface functionalization of GO,controlling the crosslinking density and interaction types are necessary to improve mechanical properties due to the conflict between stiffness, toughness and the strength properties [26,28]. Thus, it is required to build strong interactions between all GO sheets as well as interactions between long chain covalent crosslinking of PVA and GO sheets with the help of a third component. This helps GO sheets with adequate movement space during the loading, absorption of more energy, resulting in a stiff and tough hydrogel. Dopamine (DA), a mussel adhesive protein, has attracted enormous research attention owing to its advantage of ability to modify a wide range of organic and inorganic surfaces making it a promising candidate to ameliorate dispersion quality as well as interfacial adhesion in nanocomposites [29]. Gao et al. polymerized dopamine as a coating on the basal planes of graphene and observed notable enhancement of adsorption capacity for different kinds of pollutants [30]. Similar results were achieved by Zhao et al. on pre-concentration and pre-decontamination of radionuclide from aqueous solutions by coating polydopamine (PDA) on the GNP [31]. Dopamine can also react with GO sheets, as it can be self-polymerized into PDA polymers with long chains that reduce GO at the same time and serve as a versatile platform for the modification of reduced GO by forming covalently grafted functional layers [28]. Polydopamine nanoparticles can also be used as reinforcing agents in hydrogels, as used in N-isopropyl acrylamide (PNIPAM) hydrogel by Han et al. for preparation of sensors used in tissue engineering [32]. Meanwhile, PDA nanoparticles in PVA nanocomposite hydrogels have not been thouroughly studied yet. The main objective of the current study is to increase the reinforcing efficiency of GO in the PVA-Borax hydrogels through enhancing the interfacial adhesion and dispersion of GO nanoplatletes using inherent properties of polydopamine as nanoparticles or GO surface coating agent. In this regard, capability of two forms of PDA, i.e. PDA nanoparticles and PDA coated-GO surface to develop reinforced polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/GO nanocomposite hydrogels were examined and compared in order to find the best enhancement approach. Therefore, two types of PVA/GO hydrogels consist of various levels of PDA coatings and nanoparticles were prepared using solution-casting method. The effects of PDA nanoparticles and PDA coated-GO in interfacial adhesion, rheological and mechanical properties enhancement as well as self-healing properties of PVA/GO hydrogels were assessed using various techniques. Finally, considerable enhancement in mechanical properties was achieved without sacrificing the self-healing property, as a result of the effective preparation method and surface functionalization of GO nanoplateltes."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (99.9%, average molecular weight 164–186 kg mol−1), potassium permanganate (99.0%), dopamine hydrochloride (99.0%), sodium nitrate (99.0%) and Tris hydrochloride (99.99%) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Sulfuric acid (98%), hydrogen chloride (30%), di-sodium tetra borate (borax salt), ethanol and methanol were purchased from Merck. SP-1 graphite powder was provided from Bay Carbon Inc. and Hydrogen peroxide (30%) was obtained from Dae-Jung."
3,Synthesis of GO nanoplatletes (GNP),"2.2 Synthesis of GO nanoplatletes (GNP) GO can be synthesized through different methods such as electrochemical approach [33] or Hummers’ method [34,35], which are the most popular methods widely used. Electrochemical approach can also provide us with different carbon nanoparticles including fluorescent carbon dots, which can be applied in a number of applications including bio-sensing, drug delivery, and catalysisn [36]. In this study, GO was synthesized using modified Hummers' method. Based on the XRD data, FE-SEM and AFM results and using the Brag and Scherer laws, one can calculate the crystallite thickness and number of layers of GNP [37]. The details of the GNP synthesis and characterizations are given in the Supplementary information."
4,Synthesis of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA),"2.3 Synthesis of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) PDA nanoparticles were synthesized throughout oxidative polymerization method [38,39]. Briefly, dopamine hydrochloride powder was dissolved in 10 mM Tris hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) buffer solution (pH 8.5) at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL and was under stirring for 24 h. The resultant dark solution was first rinsed three times with deionized water and then three times with methanol followed by centrifuging at 6500 rpm for 1 h. Finally, the supernatant was removed and residue was dried at 40 °C under vacuum [40]. To prevent agglomeration, which are common when dried PDA is used, the nanoparticles were used immediately following solution production without drying PDA."
5,Preparation of polydopamine coated graphene oxide (CGO),"2.4 Preparation of polydopamine coated graphene oxide (CGO) Poly(dopamine) coated graphene oxide (CGO) was prepared as follows: 25 mg of dopamine hydrochloride was added into 50 mL of Tris-HCl buffer solution (10 mM). The pH was set to 8.5 using 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. The obtained solution and 20 mL of the GO suspension (2.5 mg/mL) were then mixed and stirred at ambient conditions for 2 h [30,41]. Afterwards, a dark brown solution was obtained via sonication for 4 h, followed by centrifuging at 5500 rpm for 20 min, which led to a halt in the reduction of GO. Finally, the output was washed and rinsed three times with methanol and water in turn and was then dried under ambient conditions [28]."
6,Fabrication of PVA based hydrogel nanocomposites,"2.5 Fabrication of PVA based hydrogel nanocomposites In order to prepare PVA based hydrogel nanocomposites, GO or CGO nanoplatletes were dispersed in distilled water and PDA was dispersed in Tris-HCl buffer solution (10 mM, PH = 8.5) at concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. A certain amount of PVA and Borax (PVA:Borax ratio 4:1 based on our previous work [42]) were added to distilled water and stirred continuously at 90 °C for 8 h. The amount of GO content in all hydrogel nanocomposite samples was fixed at 0.75 wt%, because in this content, the maximum storage modulus is reached, while at higher loadings, the elastic properties of hydrogel is deteriorated as presented in Fig. S3 in the Supplementary information. In order to fabricate PVA/GO hydrogel nanocomposites reinforced with PDA nanoparticles (the P-NG0.5 sample shown in Table 1 ), aqueous suspension of GO (2.5 mg/ml) and proper amount of dispersed PDA nanoparticles in Tris-HCl buffer were mixed together and poured dropwise into the aqueous PVA/Borax solution to obtain the P-NG sample. To fabricate PVA/CGO hydrogel nanocomposite (P-CG sample), the same procedure was followed and PVA/Borax solution was prepared. Then, predetermined amount of CGO dispersion was added to PVA/Borax solution. The hydrogels were kept at ambient condition for 72 h to achieve the equilibrium structure for debubbling process. Table 1 shows the composition and codes of the prepared hydrogels, in which, the amount of GO was fixed while the content of different forms of polydopamine coated on GO or PDA nanoparticles, was changed."
7,Characterization methods,"2.6 Characterization methods To study the morphology of samples, a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Mira II-Tescan) was utilized. Before imaging, the hydrogel samples were freeze-dried and sputter coated with thin gold tin layer. The particle size distribution of PDA nanoparticles was measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern Nano-ZS). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, SPM FemtoScan) facilitated analyzing the thickness changes of GO platelets. The dispersion of nanoparticles was observed by optical microscope (Olympus BX51). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies were performed with an ABB Bomem MB-Series spectrometer in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1, with 4 cm−1 resolutions to characterize functional groups of nanomaterials and hydrogel structures. The viscoelastic behavior of hydrogel nanocomposites was assessed using an oscillatory shear rheometer (Paar Physica USD200) in frequency sweep mode from 0.1 to 100 rad/s. The measurements were conducted with parallel plate geometry of 1 mm in gap at room temperature and predetermined linear viscoelastic region. Uniaxial tensile testing was carried out to study the mechanical and self-healing properties of hydrogel nanocomposites by employing a H10KS Hounsfield universal testing machine at 20 mm/min of crosshead speed in accordance with ASTM D882 [43]. The hydrogel specimens were provided in the form of rectangular strips with 24 mm*100 mm sizes and were then kept at room temperature for 48 h to reach equilibrium state. The test was done at room temperature and the results were reported as average values of five tests for each sample."
8,Results and discussions,
9,Characterization of the PDA nanoparticles and dopamine coated graphene oxide (CGO),"3.1 Characterization of the PDA nanoparticles and dopamine coated graphene oxide (CGO) Typical FTIR spectrum of dopamine in Fig. 1 (a) shows sharp peaks at 1500, 1604 and 3343 cm−1 related to amine (N–H) groups [43]. In the case of PDA, the stretching vibration of O–H/N–H was observed at 3397 cm−1. The stretching vibrations of aliphatic and aromatic C–H groups are also located at 2923 and 3000 cm−1, respectively. The detected peaks at 1511 and 1604 cm−1 are ascribed to the indole unit of PDA structure [44,45]. As it can be seen, C–O (1040 cm−1) and C–N (1191 cm−1) stretching vibrations as well as -C-C-H (1284 cm−1) bending bonds of dopamine chloride were approximately disappeared upon polymerization. Moreover, inter-plane bending bonds of H–N–H group in DA which appeared at 844 and 1614 cm−1, were severely weakened, confirming PDA formation [45,46]. As it can be observed from Fig. 1(b), CGO sample shows almost similar peaks to GO [28,31,41], except for a reduction peak in 3433 cm−1 which represents C–OH stretching vibration, suggesting the partially reduction of GO during PDA synthesis. Moreover, improvement and reinforcement of C–O stretching vibrations in 1047 cm−1, appearance of 1284 cm−1 and 1385 cm−1 peaks for C–N stretching vibrations and –CH2 shear vibrations which belong to PDA chains, confirm the formation of PDA on the GO surface [44,45,47]. Also, CO stretching peak of GO at 1738 cm−1 is disappeared in CGO, suggesting the reduction of GO during synthesis of PDA. Moreover, N–H bending vibrations of aromatic secondary amine in 1517 cm−1 represents formed covalent bond between GO and PDA which also could help the bonding between GO sheets and PVA matrix [41,42]. Fig. 2 (a) illustrates the SEM image of the monotonic size distribution of nearly spherical as-synthesized PDA nanoparticles after sonication [38], while Fig. 2(b) shows the particle size distribution of synthesized PDA sample before and after sonication. The sonication energy can disrupt the PDA agglomerates, leading to the dispersion of primary PDA nanoparticles. The mean particle size distribution of as synthesized PDA agglomerates is 1248 ± 20 nm, while that of the primary PDA nanoparticles obtained after sonication is around 85.4 ± 10 nm, confirming the formation of the PDA particles in nanometer scale as shown in SEM images, Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2(c) exhibits the SEM image of CGO sample at different magnifications. It seems that PDA domains, shown with a circle, were uniformly located on the GO surface. The diameter of the recognized PDA domains is around 100 nm, which is in good agreement with the value obtained using DLS after 2 h sonication. It is worth to mention that some agglomerations are seen on GO surfaces as well, observed in the lower magnification image. For better evaluation of the formation of the PDA coating on the GO surface, the AFM technique was utilized, result of which is shown in Fig. S3 in Supplementary information. Therefore, it is concluded that through polymerization of DA in presence of GO sheets, a layer of PDA can be formed on the GO surface accompanied with formation of some PDA particles distributed on the GO sheets as evident in SEM image."
10,Morphological characterization,"3.2 Morphological characterization Fig. 3 presents the SEM micrographs of samples after freeze drying and analyzing by ImageJ software. A porous network structure with pore size of less than 50 μm was observed in all samples. The pore sizes are decreasing with increasing the interaction between the nano fillers and PVA matrix as reported by other researchers [38,49,50]. Data obtained from ImageJ software shows more than 50% pore size reduction both in average pore size (APS) and distribution (DPS) using 0.75 wt% GO, the P-G sample, compared with the neat PVA hydrogel. Crosslink density and net points are increased by introducing GO due to the strong interfacial adhesion between PVA and the GNP, as well as increment of complex viscosity which hinders the water removal quickly [39,51]. Interestingly, the desirable role of DA in the development of pore uniformity for both types of applications can be inferred from Fig. 3 and obtained data from Image J. A significant drop in APS, around 50%, is observed in P-CG0.5 as compared to P-G sample. P-CG0.5, for instance, shows 1.85 μm and 0.87 μm APS and DPS, respectively, which is considerable compared to the neat PVA with 13.16 μm APS and 2.39 μm DPS and even P-G with APS of 4.15 μm and DPS of 1.10 μm. We can also observe that among all reinforced samples, P-CG0.5 contained lower APS, which may illustrate higher enhancement and reinforcement in this sample. Based on the above results, the hydrogen bonds which arise from DA treatment can act as same as GO-based crosslinks and enhance the complex viscosity, by which the pore size tends to be somewhat controlled. The variation trend of nanocomposites microstructures can influence the rheological and mechanical properties, presented in the following, showing the vital role of interfacial attraction between the PVA chains and GO surface through DA modification in the development of microstructure and corresponding macroscopic properties."
11,Rheological properties of hydrogels,"3.3 Rheological properties of hydrogels Fig. 4 (a) illustrates rheological properties of the PVA hydrogel that contains no GO. Fig. 4(b) shows the rheological properties of P-G hydrogel sample having 0.75 wt% GO, measured in oscillatory shear mode. It is obvious that the storage modulus (G′) in Fig. 4(b) is higher than the loss modulus in whole frequencies indicating the solid-like behavior. The complex viscosity (η*), on the other hand, is highly increased at low frequencies. These indicate the formation of a 3D network of GO platelets in the PVA hydrogel matrix. The presence of oxygen containing groups in GO platelets helps the formation of strong interaction between GO platelets and PVA chains, promoting the formation of 3D network structure with remarkable boost in elastic properties. According to Fig. 4, the increment of η* and Gʹ of hydrogel nanocomposites was identified in both forms of PDA incorporation (i.e. as nanoparticles in P-NG0.5 sample and as coating on GO in P-CG0.5 and P-CG1.0 samples). The increase of rheological properties is attributed to the improvement of nanoparticles dispersion and enhancement of interfacial adhesion in the presence of PDA nanoparticles [48]. It should be mentioned that all prepared nanocomposite hydrogels show good dispersion of GO and PDA particles as evident in optical microscopy images given in Fig. S4 in supplementary information. There are noticeable numbers of amine and hydroxyl groups on the surface of PDA particles and chains, which can strongly form hydrogen bonds with PVA hydroxyl groups in addition to the possible chain entanglements of the two polymers [29]. On the other hand, it occurs between PDA and GO surface through its oxygen containing groups as pointed out from the FTIR results. Moreover, the π-π interactions between catechols in PDA and small areas of graphite in GO could contribute a lot to improvement of interfacial adhesion [30,41,48]. Among the samples, the P-CG0.5 presented higher elastic properties than that of P-CG1.0 sample, probably because at high content of DA, the positive effects are outweighed by immiscibility between PVA and PDA, resulting in the attenuation of PVA/GO interactions. Comparing the Gʹ and η* values of P-NG0.5 and P-CG0.5 samples, it seems that at the same content of DA the formation of PDA layer on GO associated with PDA particles is more efficient in increasing the interfacial adhesion between filler surface and PVA matrix chains."
12,Mechanical and self-healing properties of hydrogels,"3.4 Mechanical and self-healing properties of hydrogels Fig. 5 (a) exhibits the stress-strain curves of tensile test of PVA hydrogel and corresponding hydrogel nanocomposites, which shows considerable enhancement in tensile properties for all hydrogel nanocomposites compared to neat PVA hydrogel sample, confirming the reinforcing role of GO in PVA matrix. Table 2 shows the mechanical properties of the samples extracted from Fig. 5(a), for better quantitative comparison. Mechanical results, presented in Fig. 5, indicate the favorable effect of DA loading on all tensile properties. As can be seen in Table 2, the P-CG0.5 sample exhibited a sharp increase in Young's modulus and tensile strength at break owing to 0.375 wt% of DA coated directly on the GO surface. In terms of elongation at break, more than 50% increment was detected for DA-modified sample compared with P-G. However, at the same content of DA, the PDA nanoparticles containing hydrogel, P-NG0.5, showed less mechanical improvement with respect to the PDA coated GO sample, the P-CG0.5. This may be associated with the PDA nanoparticles agglomeration and the subsequent less interaction between PDA nanoparticles, GNP and PVA chains. This result is in line with discussed rheological properties. Furthermore, the capability of 0.75 wt% of DA to enhance tensile properties of P-G hydrogel nanocomposites are generally below the addition of 0.375 wt% PDA, in agreement with the rheological measurements. Interestingly, the P-CG0.5 sample shows an obvious yield point around 185 kPa and tensile strength at break more than 400 kPa and high elongation at break, which are the evidences of a tough mechanical behavior. It can be concluded that the enhancement of polymer chains attracted on GO's surface in DA-modified samples as well as hydrogen bonds lead to formation of a strong network, which shows higher resistance to destruction as opposed to untreated hydrogel nanocomposites. The network formation resulting in improving the mechanical properties, specially the toughness of the sample, estimated as the area under the stress –strain curve. This can be intensified by the π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding in P-CG0.5 as mentioned before in rheological and FTIR results, which is then followed by P-NG0.5 and P-CG1.0 [30,41]. Hwang et al. showed that dopamine coated GO is a stronger reinforcement for PVA matrix in comparison to GO in PVA/GO nanocomposites and suggested that the addition of 0.5 wt% dopamine coated GO with a weight ratio of 0.5:1 polydopamine: GO resulted in 82.9 MPa tensile strength and 184% strain-to-failure [28]. In comparison, results of this study show a maximum of 369% of elongation at break in P-CG0.5 sample with the same weight ratio as expected. Hwang et al. also showed that excessive amounts of polydopamine could lead to weakened mechanical properties, due to heterogeneity between DA and PVA and miscibility issues [28]. The self-healing ability is one of the main requirements of modern hydrogels for different robust applications including programmable stimuli-responsive materials [3]. Extrinsic (pre-introduction of healing agent into material), and intrinsic (based on reversible bonds) strategies, are two main types of self-healing systems [52,53]. In this regard, different methods including hydrogen bonds, host-guest interaction, metal coordination, ionic interactions, hydrophobic associations and dynamic chemical bonds can be considered to fabricate the self-healing hydrogels [54]. The self-healing ability was quantitatively and qualitatively monitored through tensile testing which is illustrated in Fig. 5(b). As shown, the Young's modulus of 24 and 48 h healed P-G sample was 2.48 and 2.93 MPa, respectively, resulting in roughly the same properties as the original sample [55]. This remarkable recovery was also observed in tensile strength and elongation at break, indicating almost 75% self-healing efficiency for P-G hydrogels in 24 h and 83% for the original sample after 48 h. Stress at break for P-CG0.5 healed for 24 and 48 h was 365.4 and 398.5 kPa, respectively. The presence of high weld-line strength allows them to show more than 3.4 MPa of Young's modulus after 24 h and about 4 MPa at the end of the 48-h period, as well as elongation at break of 330%, leading to 92% recovery of P-CG0.5 after 48 h. Thus, the surface treatment of GO by DA causes the weld-line strength to ameliorate via progression of reversible interactions and interfacial adhesion between PVA chains and the surface of the reinforcing agent. Considering the bio-adhesive nature of the dopamine, it is expected that the adhesion properties of the prepared hydrogels to some polar surfaces could be improved [56]. More specific adhesion tests should be performed in further investigation to determine the effect of PDA on adhesion property of PVA hydrogels. It may also be noteworthy that DA coating leads to the promotion of strain hardening phenomenon in nanocomposite hydrogels, via stress transfer from PVA to GNP. This causes orientation of GNP along PVA chains, resulting in a dramatic rise in the breaking strength of hydrogels seen in Fig. 5. We can also observe toughness enhancement with the addition of fillers. As shown in Fig. 5, P-CG0.5 benefits from larger area under stress-strain curve in comparison to other samples. Fig. 6 demonstrates a schematic of the interactions between PVA chains and GNP in P-CG0.5 and P-NG0.5 samples. This increase can also be attributed to a strong network of hydrogen bonds including PVA free chains and physically linked CGO as first and second interpenetrating networks of double-network structure with high crosslinking density and abundant reversible bonds. The enhanced mechanical properties and its healing properties originated form specific interactions between DA and PVA chains, can meet the typical requirements for a wide variety of applications such as soft robotics [2,7]. In conclusion, it can be seen that P-G and P-CG0.5 hydrogel nanocomposites are showing self-healing capability, which is enhanced over time and with the inclusion of polydopamine, as reported in previous studies [55,57]. Images of Fig. 7 illustrate P-CG0.5 nanocomposite hydrogel in different modes. In Fig. 7(a) and (b), the entanglement ability of hydrogel nanocomposite and its extension ability without rupture can be seen. To prove hydrogel's foldability, a thin layer of P-CG0.5 was folded, shown in Fig. 7(c). An example of hydrogel's discussed strength and mechanical properties can be seen in Fig. 7 (d). Tensile property of samples was presented in Fig. 7(e). Fig. 7(f) shows the translucency of P-CG0.5 sample. Although a considerable amount of fillers has been used, it can be observed that the prepared sample still benefits from good translucency, thanks to well dispersion of surface modified GNP with dopamine layer."
13,Conclusion,"This study is primarily concerned with the variations of P-G behavior in terms of rheological, mechanical, self-healing and morphological properties upon the introduction of PDA in two forms of nanoparticles and coating. Formation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups at PVA/PDA and PDA/GO interfaces as well as π-π interactions between catechol groups in PDA chains and residual graphite in GO were identified as the main reasons for enhancing elastic and mechanical properties, by which, the Young's modulus of P-CG0.5, P-CG1.0 and P-NG0.5 reached 4.36, 3.77 and 3.69 MPa, respectively. Thus, these fully physically-linked nanocomposite hydrogels benefit from higher self-healing, strength and toughness properties. Nevertheless, the tensile strength of P-CG1.0 was lower than P-CG0.5 and P-NG0.5 which was attributed to the negative effect of PVA/PDA immiscibility at high content of DA, leading to agglomeration of GO sheets. The self-healing ability as a critical issue in wound dressing applications was also increased from 80% in P-G to 95% in P-CG0.5 due to improvement of interfacial adhesion between PVA and GO. Monitoring the uniformity of morphology from SEM micrographs also elucidates why P-CG0.5 properties are higher than that of P-NG0.5. The results confirm that dopamine-treated PVA/GO hydrogels may meet the requirements to be applied in wound dressing systems."
