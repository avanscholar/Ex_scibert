0,Introduction,"Currently, global energy production is based on the use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas (Rossetti et al., 2015a) and accounts for approximately 65% of global GHG emissions (Uusitalo et al., 2017). Dependence on the use of fossil fuels as an energy resource has caused environmental problems of global impact, such as air pollution in terms of emission of pollutants and particles, as well as the depletion of natural resources, among others (Hajjaji et al., 2016; Reyes-Valle et al., 2015), which leads to adverse consequences for society in terms of human health and damage to the ecosystem (Valente et al., 2019). So much so that the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations includes ensuring access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all. This objective aims at guaranteeing universal access to energy service, substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix and doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency. This is why the paradigm shift towards clean energy production must be based on available renewable resources (Da Costa-Serra and Chica, 2018). In recent years, numerous alternatives to the use of traditional fossil fuels have been proposed, such as the production of biofuels, bioalcohols, hydrogen or any type of renewable energy (Balat, 2011). In particular, biomass is one of the renewable energy sources that has experienced strong growth in recent years, due to its global availability and diversity (Spiridon et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2018). Biofuels derived from biomass offer a number of advantages over their oil-based counterparts according to Demirbas (2008): they can be considered carbon neutral after-combustion by fixing carbon during biomass growth, close to a carbon-neutral balance, so that they contribute to achieving sustainability goals. For this reason, numerous initiatives have been developed in the development of conversion technologies based on resources derived from biomass (Unrean et al., 2018). Focusing on the different types of fuels, hydrogen is a high quality energy carrier that can be used with high efficiency (Frolov et al., 2013) and is expected to acquire great importance in next generation fuels (Alipour-Moghadam et al., 2014). This fact, together with declining fossil fuel reserves, steadily rising prices and increasing pollution make hydrogen a very attractive product for meeting global energy demand (Khaodee et al., 2011). However, the environmental profile of hydrogen-based energy systems is as ""clean"" or ""dirty"" depending on the scheme of conversion (Rabenstein and Hacker, 2008). The traditional schemes producing H2 from natural gas are a major source of CO2, with emissions of approximately 10–12 kg of CO2 per kg of H2 (Spath and Mann, 2001). Traditional plants produce hydrogen by catalytic steam reforming of natural gas, which is a mature technology and is the pathway by which most hydrogen is produced today. Because of this, reducing CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production would result in a considerable reduction of pollution (Salkuyeh et al., 2018). In this sense, fuel cells technology and the use of hydrogen are proposed as one of the most promising environmental solutions in relation to the reduction of global emissions (Díaz Alvarado and Gracia, 2010). Fuel cells are devices that electrochemically convert chemical energy from fuels into electricity (Morales et al., 2010). Among the different types of fuel cells, the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) is the most efficient, due to its high operating temperatures and the fact that it is not poisoned with CO (Hernández and Kafarov, 2009). When this type of battery is used, an efficiency around 50% can be obtained (Strazza et al., 2015); in addition, an efficiency of 70% can be achieved if cogeneration system is used (Strazza et al., 2010). Hydrogen production from renewable sources such as poplar (Susmozas et al., 2016) or willow wood (González-García et al., 2012), sugar cane (Halleux et al., 2008), sweet potato (Costa et al., 2018), sorghum (Aguilar-Sánchez et al., 2018) or sugar beet (Luo et al., 2009) have been investigated as the first actions to achieve a significant reduction of environmental impacts (Salkuyeh et al., 2018). Hydrogen can be obtained from different feedstocks through steam reforming (Braga et al., 2016; López et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019), autothermal reforming (Khila et al., 2017; Spallina et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2017) and aqueous phase reforming (Coronado et al., 2018; Esteve-Adell et al., 2017; García et al., 2018), among them, steam reforming is the most common, as almost 90% of H2 is produced by natural gas reforming. It also has the highest conversion efficiency, around 70% (Haryanto et al., 2005). Steam reforming of natural gas is the most popular method for producing commercial hydrogen that currently covers about 50% of global hydrogen demand (Anzelmo et al., 2018) and is sometimes referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR). Steam reforming is an endothermic process based on the reaction of gas with steam at high temperature and moderate pressure. In this way, the chemical reaction taking place leads to hydrogen and carbon dioxide (Reaction (1)): (1) CH3CH2OH + H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2 ΔHr = 174 kJ mol−1 However, depending on the reaction mixture and operating conditions in the reactor, another route can be followed, producing undesirable products (Ni et al., 2007), such as carbon monoxide (Reaction (2)), methane (Reaction (3)) or ethylene (Reaction (4)): (2) CH3CH2OH + H2O → 2CO + 4H2 ΔHr = 256 kJ mol−1 (3) CH3CH2OH → CO + CH4 + H2 ΔHr=50 kJ mol−1 (4) CH3CH2OH → C2H4 + H2O ΔHr = 46 kJ mol−1 Once the process is complete, the output stream must undergo purification treatment to avoid the presence of by-products such as methane and carbon monoxide. The removal of CO is an important step because it normally poisons the catalyst in fuel cells, that is why CO is removed first by the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction (Reaction (5)). WGS is an exothermic and reversible reaction usually used in industry to produce high purity hydrogen (Alamolhoda et al., 2019). Normally, 90% of the CO outflowing from the steam reforming reactor can be converted to CO2 (Rossetti et al., 2015b). (5) CO + H2O → H2 + CO2 ΔHr = −41 kJ mol−1 Following this stage, the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) process separates hydrogen from the rest of the components of the gas stream with 85% efficiency, obtaining H2 with 99% purity (Susmozas et al., 2013), and whose energy content is usually higher than that of the natural gas used for reforming. The implementation of other alternatives of hydrogen production can be considered from alternative raw materials, such as alcohols (Rossetti et al., 2015a). In addition to steam reforming of ethanol, studies have been published on steam reforming of different types of alcohol with the aim of producing hydrogen. Some of these alcohols are butanol (Kumar et al., 2018), propanol (Wang et al., 2015), methanol (Tian et al., 2017) or glycerol (Menezes et al., 2018) but, even so, the use of ethanol for this purpose offers the best opportunity to produce hydrogen from renewable sources (Ramírez and Homs, 2008), especially if this ethanol is derived as residue from other processes. Specifically, the alcoholic wastes from the wine industry results an attractive raw material due to 65% of world wine production is managed by European winegrowers mostly small and medium-sized wineries according to the Comité Européen des Enterprises Vins (CEEV, 2016). Wine production generates large amounts of solid and liquid wastes, with a serious impact on the environment when they are not adequately treated. The liquid wastes are processed in distilleries to obtain purified alcohols, but in these processes, alcoholic purges without commercial value containing impurities separated from the good quality alcohols are generated. Thus, the process here analysed aims to raise awareness of the potential of these by-products and their valorization activities as a sustainable way to produce hydrogen. The main objective of the study is to analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the steam reforming of alcoholic waste from distilleries. Quantifying the consumption of material and energy resources during the life cycle makes it possible to estimate potential changes and emissions to the environment. The main product of the process is hydrogen (H2), along with a certain amount of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and ethylene (C2H4), which accounts for a proportion lower than 30%. This output stream is used to produce energy in a 3 kW SOFC."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Definition of goal and scope,"2.1 Definition of goal and scope The Life Cycle Analysis methodology has been considered as a fundamental tool in the analysis of the environmental profile associated with the steam reforming of alcoholic waste from distilleries in order to identify key environmental performance indicators. In distilleries, alcohol can be extracted from some wines that cannot been marketed. During this distillation process, an ethanol-rich fraction is obtained, but also a residual fraction that remains in the distiller's tail, which is the residue used in this study. Fig. 1 presents the block diagram of the process, identifying the system boundaries, the different subsystems considered and the main inputs and outputs of the system. No infrastructure process was considered in the evaluation, since the environmental impacts per process unit, from installation, construction, decommissioning, infrastructure, machinery, etc., have been considered negligible during the lifetime of this type of facilities. This has been a common practice in other life cycle assessment studies of biorefineries (Jeswani et al., 2015; Karlsson et al., 2014). However, this study has taken into account the manufacture of the catalyst and the SOFC phase, due to the fact that their useful life is clearly shorter than that of large installations. The foreground system includes the process units that are the direct object of this study. For the purposes of the study, three subsystems (SS) have been considered, which are detailed below: Subsystem 1: Catalyst formulation. This subsystem considers all the materials necessary for the manufacture of the catalyst used in the reforming reactor (Menor et al., 2017). The catalyst is composed of a sepiolite base with Nickel (15% weight) and Lanthanum (1% weight). Its considered useful life is 20 months, regenerating every 4 months. The transport of the catalyst to the plant is also considered, taking as distance 100 km. Subsystem 2: Steam reforming. This process includes all the inputs needed to perform the steam reforming process. These inputs are mainly electricity, water and alcohol residues from distilleries. The transport of alcoholic waste to the plant is not included, as this type of facility is designed to be included in the distillery. The waste produced in this subsystem is the catalyst spent at the end of its useful life and is considered 100 km as the average transport to the landfill. Subsystem 3: SOFC. This subsystem includes the net production of electricity in the SOFC using the SS2 gas stream as feed. At the exit of this subsystem, CO2 and H2O emissions are derived from the reactions taking place with CO and CH4, C2H4 and H2 inside the battery. The electricity produced is fed into the grid. The SOFC works at a high temperature of around 600 °C and produces a large amount of heat, as represented is Figs. 1 and 2 , this heat is redirected to the system and used to heat the stream entering the reforming reactor. This subsystem includes the SOFC manufacturing stage. Gas stream purifying processes are not included because SOFC are not poisoned by the presence of CO (Hernández and Kafarov, 2009). This type of device directly provides electricity from the chemical reaction taking place. The electrodes of this type of battery are catalytic, so they are relatively stable and are not consumed (Fragiacomo et al., 2018). The Background System includes the production of raw materials, fuel, chemicals and water used in the process, as well as the consumption of fuel used in the transportation of materials. As the basis for the calculation or Functional Unit (FU), the treatment of 1 tonne of alcoholic waste in the facility was chosen, which will be taken as a reference for all the inputs and products of the system as well as the emissions, energy consumption and transport associated with this process (ISO, 2006a,b). The description of the steam reforming process is presented in detail in Fig. 2. The waste from the distillery enters the plant with approximately 92% v/v ethanol, to which water is added to reach 80% v/v water and 20% v/ ethanol. The steam-to-carbon molar ratio (S/C ratio) used in most cases is 3:1 (Jeon et al., 2018), but in this case a steam-to-carbon ratio of 6:1 was considered. This steam-to-carbon ratio increases the production of CO2 and H2 and reduces the formation of the undesirable products mentioned in Eq.s 2–4, but increases the heat necessary to vaporize the water/ethanol mixture. However, since this heat is supplied by the residual heat produced in the SOFC, the use of additional fuel is not necessary. The stream passes through a heat exchanger where it is heated up to 600 °C, the temperature required for the inlet stream of the reforming reactor. The output of the reactor is a gas stream comprised by H2, CO2, CO, CH4, H2O and a minor proportion of C2H4. This stream is fed to the SOCF, where heat and electricity are produced. The high temperature stream is recycled in the system to heat the water and ethanol feed, reducing energy consumption. The electricity produced is fed into the grid."
3,Data acquisition and life cycle inventory,"2.2 Data acquisition and life cycle inventory Life cycle inventory involves the collection of qualitative and/or quantitative input/output data for the system. In the case of Subsystem 1, catalyst manufacturing data were obtained from a previous study about the formulation of a sepiolite-based catalyst with the addition of Ni (Menor et al., 2017), although the amount of catalyst used is a primary data. In relation to the Steam Reforming Subsystem, all the information on the consumption of the process comes from primary data, except electricity consumption, which was obtained from a study about the life-cycle assessment of biomass gasification as an alternative to steam methane reforming for hydrogen production (Susmozas et al., 2013); where an electric consumption of 1.35 kW h per kg H2 produced was considered. Finally, the inventory of Subsystem 3 has been obtained from various scientific publications. (Strazza et al., 2015, 2010) conducted several studies to assess the environmental profile of two SOFC systems: one with 230 kW and other one with 20 kW system. (Lee et al., 2015) obtained the environmental impact of a 100 kW SOFC power generation system. The different life cycle inventories published in the above-mentioned manuscripts were adapted to the characteristics of the battery used in the study. Background system processes have been taken from Ecoinvent® database. Tables 1–3 present the life cycle inventory of the different subsystem considered in this study."
4,Life cycle impact analysis: methodology,"2.3 Life cycle impact analysis: methodology Simapro 8.5.2 (PRé Consultants, 2017) has been the software used for the implementation of the Life Cycle Inventory. To analyze the inputs and outputs of the Life Cycle Inventory, the Classification and Characterization guidelines defined by ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 (ISO, 2006a,b) were followed. The environmental results have been presented in terms of the following impact categories of the ReCiPe methodology: Climate Change (CC), Ozone Layer Depletion (OD), Terrestrial Acidification (TA), Freshwater Eutrophication (FE), Marine Eutrophication (ME), Human Toxicity (HT), Photochemical Oxidant Formation (POF), Particulate Matter Formation (PMF), Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TET), Freshwater Ecotoxicity (FET), Marine Ecotoxicity (MET) and Fossil Fuel Depletion (FD)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Environmental characterization,"3.1 Environmental characterization The environmental characterization of the alcoholic waste steam reforming resulted in the impacts reported in Table 4 . All impacts in Table 4 are attributed to the Functional Unit (1 tonne feedstock). The SOFC is the main contributor to the Climate Change (CC) category, since this subsystem comprises several processes necessary for the manufacture of the main components. In SS3, direct emissions into the atmosphere are quantified, directly from the alcoholic stream, residue produced from grape fermentation. Therefore, CO2 emissions from SS3 should not be considered as fossil carbon, but as biogenic CO2. This decision agrees with a study on the production of hydrogen and electricity by reforming supercritical water from bioglycerol feedstock (Galera and Gutiérrez-Ortiz, 2015). If CO2 was not considered biogenic, direct CO2 emissions would represent almost 60% of environmental impact in the climate change category. Therefore, the final impact on this category would be 2146 kg CO2 eq per tonne of alcoholic waste processed at the facility. The Ozone Layer Depletion category has fairly low values in all subsystems. Freshwater and Marine Eutrophication (FE and ME) show similar behavior, as they are influenced by the same type of substances. The impact value in these categories is relatively similar in all subsystems, which makes the final impact value low. Human Toxicity (HT) and Fossil Depletion (FD) have relatively high levels compared to the rest of the impact categories. The reason is the formulation of catalysts and the manufacture of SOFC, since heavy metals and hazardous substances are required that cause a high impact in the HT category. As for the FD category, its value is related to the high consumption of fossil fuels associated with the formulation of catalysts and the manufacture of SOFC. The specific contribution of each subsystem to the impacts calculated for the system is shown in Fig. 3 . The manufacture and operation of the SOFC (SS3) was found to dominate almost all impact categories, with percentages ranging from 57.7% in Photochemical Oxidant Formation (POF) to 85.6% in Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TET). Additionally, the steam reforming subsystem (SS2) showed a significant contribution to Climate Change (31,3%), Terrestrial Acidification (30,4%) and Photochemical Oxidant Formation (32,9%). The remaining subsystem (SS1) accounted for a contribution percentage around 10%, except for ME, where the contribution was higher than 45%. In order to highlight the processes with the highest environmental impact on the life cycle performance of the system, the individual contributions to the impact are broken down in Fig. 4 . These results show that SOFC manufacturing is the major contribution in almost all impact categories, except for ME. Therefore, the manufacture of SOFC is the main hotspot of the system and must have the highest priority in the improvement actions from the environmental point of view. The second largest contributor to the total environmental impact is electricity consumption, with contributions percentage ranging from 15% in HT to 32.9% in POF. If electricity production is taken into account, its contribution to environmental impact decreases significantly to 4.2% and 9.1% in HT and POF, respectively. The formulation of catalysts presented a uniform distribution of environmental impacts in all categories, with contributions always below 10.6%. The consumption of natural gas to heat the process is only responsible for a maximum of 9.4% in CC and 8.5% in FD, but in the rest of the impact categories, their contributions never exceed 6%. The rest of the substances (transport, water consumption and waste treatment) contributed practically insignificantly to the environmental impact. Wastewater treatment is the main contributor to the ME impact, due to the high amount of nitrogen-based compounds such as nitrites and nitrates that are discharged in the treated effluent. This may explain, as seen in Fig. 3, why the main contributor to the ME impact category is SS1, due to the wastewater generated during the formulation of the catalyst. The environmental profile of alcoholic waste steam reforming is mainly due to two factors. On the one hand, the use of a raw material that is considered waste from another process and therefore has no associated environmental impact. On the other hand, the production of electricity makes it possible to obtain environmental credits that promote a better environmental profile."
7,Sensitivity analysis,"3.2 Sensitivity analysis In order to compare the environmental characterization results of some alternative waste treatments to steam reforming, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The methods selected for this analysis were landfill and incineration. Note that the inventory data for incineration and landfill were taken from the Ecoinvent® database. Fig. 5 depicts the environmental performance of the alternative treatments for the alcoholic waste considered. As noted, the steam reforming scenario potentially implied a more acceptable environmental profile than the other scenarios, except for Ozone Layer Depletion, Terrestrial Acidification, Freshwater Eutrophication and Terrestrial Ecotoxicity. In particular, steam reforming makes it possible to reduce GHG emissions by 33% compared to incineration and by 30% compared to landfill. Steam reforming is the largest contributor to OD impact for the emission of harmful gases to the stratospheric ozone layer during some operations such as electricity generation or chemical production. Regarding Terrestrial Acidification and Freshwater Eutrophication, steam reforming presents the worst environmental performance. The consumption of Ni-based compounds in the manufacture of SOFC and some processes derived from the extraction of lanthanum for SOFC are the responsible processes of the poor performance in TA and FE respectively. With respect to TET, steam reforming has worse results, but if the three ecotoxicity categories (TTE, MET and FET) are considered, the environmental impact of steam reforming is lower, improving 95.8% with respect to incineration and 97.8% with respect to the sanitary landfill."
8,Comparative analysis,"3.3 Comparative analysis In addition to the basic scheme, a comparison was made with some processes published in the scientific literature. The FU was changed to 1 kg of hydrogen produced in the plant with 99.9 vol% purity by steam reforming (Fig. 6 ), in agreement with other reforming studies using other raw materials for hydrogen production (Hajjaji et al., 2016, 2013; Khila et al., 2016; Susmozas et al., 2016, 2015, 2013), thus allowing the comparison of the environmental profile of different processes. Therefore, the new facility configuration does not consider the operation of the SOFC, consequently the output stream of the system is led to a purification system: First, the WGS process removes carbon monoxide and produces a small amount of additional hydrogen. Additionally, in a COPROX reactor the remaining CO can be further reduced to CO2 in the presence of oxygen. Finally, the PSA process separates H2 from the rest of the gases in the stream, obtaining H2 with 99% purity. Therefore, two additional subsystems were introduced to purify the output hydrogen stream (SS3) and provide cooling water (SS4) The following processes have been considered: SMR-H2: Steam reforming of methane obtained from natural gas (Susmozas et al., 2013). PG-H2: Poplar biomass gasification. The system includes the cultivation of poplar and its transport to the plant. Once in the plant are included all the operations necessary to obtain hydrogen and the production of electricity from the steam produced in the system (Susmozas et al., 2013). PG&C-H2: Gasification of poplar biomass, as mentioned above, but includes carbon fixation during the cultivation stage (Susmozas et al., 2016). GSR-H2: Glycerol reforming, obtained as a co-product of biodiesel production by transesterification of rapeseed oil. Carbon sequestration during oil production is considered (Susmozas et al., 2015). BSR-H2: Biofuel reforming, including also carbon fixation produced during the growth of biomass used for biofuel (Susmozas et al., 2015). SBR-H2: Steam reforming of bioethanol, including bioethanol production (Hajjaji et al., 2016). BAR-H2: Autothermal reforming of bioethanol (Khila et al., 2016). In order to carry out the comparative analysis, life cycle inventories were modified. In relation to the type and quantity of reaction catalyst, the WGS data were obtained from (Compagnoni et al., 2017). All the necessary data to measure the inputs and outputs in SS3. WGS and PSA and SS4. Cooling water supply were obtained from (Susmozas et al., 2015, 2013). Inventory data of WGS, PSA and Cooling water supply can be found in Table 5 . The results of the comparison between steam reforming of alcoholic residues and other related processes are presented in terms of the impact categories of the CML methodology Global warming potential (GWP – kg CO2 eq), Depletion of abiotic resources (ADP – kg Sb eq), Ozone layer depletion (ODP – kg CFC-11 eq), Photochemical oxidation (POFP – kg C2H4 eq), Acidification potential (AP – kg SO2 eq) and Eutrophication potential (EP – kg PO4 3−). The magnitudes of the environmental impacts of hydrogen production systems are displayed in Table 6 , in order to simplify the comparative study, the results are scaled to 100 and represented in Fig. 7 . For example, alcoholic waste steam reforming shows the best results in terms of ADP, ODP, AP and EP, but performs worse in GWP and has the worst result in POFC. The comparison between the present study and other published processes is possible because the environmental performance of the different studies is published in some LCA studies with a methodological framework consistent with this study. Steam reforming of alcoholic residues has the highest value in POF, due to direct emissions of CH4, which occur in relatively high quantities during steam reforming. However, this process performs well in terms of ODP with a value around 2% of BAR-H2, which is the process with the worst environmental performance in this category. Four impact categories are detailed in this section: Depletion of abiotic resources (ADP), Acidification potential (AP), Eutrophication potential (EP) and Global warming potential (GWP). These are the most common and well-established categories for assessing bioenergy systems in LCA studies (Cherubini and Strømman, 2011; Muench and Guenther, 2013; Peters et al., 2015). The total GHG emissions of the system are estimated at approximately 9.55 kg CO2 eq per kg of H2 produced. As can be seen in Fig. 8 .a, this value is relatively higher than that of other technologies but is considerably lower than that of a conventional H2 production system (SMR-H2). Approximately 90% of these emissions are attributed to direct methane emissions from the reforming reactor, as CH4 is 21 times more likely to affect GWP over a 100-year period, according to IPCC. The lowest value in this category corresponds to PG&G-H2, since this process considers CO2 capture during biomass cultivation. This explains the importance of system boundaries in an LCA study, since PG&G-H2 covers from biomass cultivation to hydrogen production with CO2 capture. However, in the present study the limit of the system ranges from alcoholic residues entering the plant to the production of electricity, so carbon sequestration during biomass cultivation is not considered. Some metals, minerals and fossil fuels are used in all H2 production systems. Fig. 8b shows that fossil methane to hydrogen system (SMR-H2) has the greatest impact on ADP, as expected, due to the large consumption of fossil fuels in the reforming process. H2 produced from bioethanol consumes considerable non-renewable resources throughout the life cycle when ethanol production phases are considered (Hajjaji et al., 2013). However, in this study, steam reforming of alcoholic waste (mainly ethanol) is the best process in terms of ADP because this ethanol is a waste derived from another process that has no associated impact. With respect to Acidification Potential and Eutrophication Potential (Fig. 8c and d), steam reforming of alcoholic waste presents the best results. The processes with the highest impact in these impact categories are those that take into account the cultivation phase (SBR-H2, BAR-H2 and GSR-H2), mainly due to the use of fertilizers containing nitrate, ammonia and phosphate in the production of bioethanol from wheat or biodiesel from rapeseed oil."
9,Conclusions,"From a life cycle perspective, the results suggest that this type of energy systems that produce hydrogen from alcoholic waste through steam reforming has good environmental performance. Overall, steam reforming of this type of alcoholic waste for energy production could play a significant role in future energy systems. The SOFC is the main contributor to environmental impact in most impact categories. Analysing the different processes, the manufacture of SOFC is the process with the greatest environmental impact in all impact categories except in ME, where wastewater treatment is the main contributor. The sensitivity analysis shows the promising performance of this waste treatment, since the treatment of 1 tonne of alcoholic waste produces 351 kg of CO2 eq, this result is 33% and 30% better than incineration and sanitary landfill respectively. It is clear that Life Cycle Assessment is a useful tool to determine the environmental performance of steam reforming of alcoholic waste to produce electricity. However, these results have been obtained by evaluating the data taken on a laboratory scale, and more studies on a larger scale will be needed in the future to determine a more accurate estimate of the actual environmental profile of the process. Comparative analysis has allowed us to compare this process with others related to the production of hydrogen from different raw materials. Although steam reforming has some poor results in GWP and POF due to methane emissions, its environmental performance is generally better than other processes published in the scientific literature."
