0,Introduction,"Among the agriculture waste materials, rice shell is a prominent one with its annual global production of 140 million tons. Since rice is a staple food for majority of population in South Asian countries, its rate of production is relatively higher compared to the other nations. In majority of the cases, much of the husk produced from the dispensation of rice is either burnt or thrown away as waste. Rice husk is one of the major available but most under-utilized biomass resources. The farmers due to time constraints between the harvest cycles have forced to burn massive content of rice husk which contributes to great haze and global warming. Burning of agricultural waste creates not only economic loss but also destructive effects on the environment. These harmful effects are emission of harmful gases in to the atmosphere and minimizing the microbial activities in the soil thus causing ecological problems [1,2]. Rice husk, which is regarded as an agricultural waste, has a high ash content varying from 18 to 20%. As a result of its high silicon content, rice husk ash has turn out to be a resource for the preparation of elementary silicon and a number of silicon compounds, especially silica [3–9], silicon carbide [10] and silicon nitride [11]. The formed rice husk residue may contain numerous metallic impurities like Fe, Mn, Na, K, Ca etc. Presence of these impurities decreases its surface area and purity. Quite a lot of attempts were made to prepare SiO2 by removing these impurities. Treatment of rice husk with acid or alkaline leaching followed by calcination at higher temperatures are the commonly employed procedures [12,13]. Current statistics revealed the lifetime of 116, 46 and 58 years for non-renewable sources such as coal, crude oil, and natural gas, respectively [14]. In the circumstances of a future fuel calamity because of the diminution of fossil fuel resources, it is necessary to explore alternative fuels. Exploitation of biomass is one of the options as of now, because of its availability at an affordable price and carbon neutrality maintenance. Among the biomass-derived platform molecules, levulinic acid occupies the top 12 potential molecules [15,16] because of its simple synthesis from cellulosic biomass via acid hydrolysis [17–21]. The existence of highly reactive groups such as –CHO and –COOH makes attractive for the conversion of levulinic acid to a variety of fuels, fuel additives and chemicals [22]. Among the products obtained from levulinic acid, γ-valerolactone can be regarded as an essential chemical due to its variety of uses such as fuel additive, solvent, insecticide, adhesive, cutting oil, brake fluid, coupling agent in dyes and its conversion to yield diesel fuel, jet fuel and other fuels. γ-valerolactone (GVL) can be prepared by the hydrogenation of levulinic acid under influence of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts while homogeneous catalysts are efficient, they have definite disadvantages like separation of the catalyst after the reaction and recyclability. To overcome this crisis, diverse heterogeneous catalysts have been reported for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) in a batch mode [23,24]. Furfural is another important biomass derived chemical. It can be hydrogenated to synthesize furfuryl alcohol, recognized as 2-furan methanol which is a chief chemical in polymer industry to produce thermostatic resins, liquid resins useful in strengthening ceramics. It is also useful in the production synthetic fibers, rubber-resins and farm chemical [25,26]. Furthermore, it is also a significant chemical intermediate for the manufacture of lysine, Vitamin C, lubricant, dispersing agent and plasticizer. The hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) to furfuryl alcohol (FOL) can be carried out either in the continuous vapor phase or in the liquid phase. The industrial catalysts for this reaction are copper chromite based catalysts. The toxicity in Cu-Cr catalysts owing to the presence of Cr2O3 cause severe environmental pollution. Application of Raney Ni, Raney Co and Raney Cu in the FAL hydrogenation have also been reported, but these catalysts show low activity or/and low selectivity [27]. Cu/C, Raney Ni, Nickel amorphous alloy and mixed copper zinc oxides with Al, Mn, and Fe were also reported for the production of furfuryl alcohol [28–30]. Conversely, continuous process is advantageous in viewpoint of green chemistry necessities like removal of toxic and volatile organic solvents. The current study is a continuance of our enduring investigation in the development of Ni-based catalysts for hydrogenation of levulinic acid and furfural in continuous procedure at atmospheric pressure [31–34]. The current work focuses on the utilization of rice husk, to get carbon-silica composite as a support for Ni catalysts for the hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) and levulunic acid (LA) to get furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and gamma valerolactone (GVL) respectively under vapor phase conditions. To the best our knowledge it is the first report on the utilization of rice husk, a biomass material as catalyst ingredient (support) for the conversion of biomass derived chemicals such as furfural and levulunic acid to value added chemicals."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation rice husk derived carbon silica,"2.1 Preparation rice husk derived carbon silica Preparation of C-SiO2 composite material from rice husk was shown in Fig. 1 . Rice husk obtained from a local rice mill was washed with distilled water to eliminate the soil particles followed by drying at 373 K in an air oven. The acid leaching and pyrolysis processes have been carried out as follows. The dried rice husk was contacted with 3 N HCl in a glass beaker at 373 K for 1 h. It was then filtered and washed repetitively with hot distilled water to ensure that the filtrate was free from acid followed by drying at 393 K for 24 h. The pyrolysis experiment was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere (N2 flow is 30 cm3 min−1) with a heating ramping of 10 K min−1 up to 473 K with a holding time of 1 h followed by further heating at a same heating ramp up to 873 K where 2 h soaking time was maintained. This pyrolysis experiment was carried out by placing the treated rice husk in a tubular reactor made up of quartz with an inner diameter of 2.5 cm. The sample was allowed to cool down in the presence of N2 flow. The grinding step was introduced by using a pistol mortar to decrease the particles size and thereby getting enhanced surface area. The calcined rice husk material contains majorly carbon, silica and small amount Ca, Mg and other mixtures. The carbon-silica thus obtained was used as a support material for nickel catalysts."
3,Preparation of rice husk derived carbon-silica supported nickel catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of rice husk derived carbon-silica supported nickel catalysts Rice husk derived carbon-silica supported Ni catalysts with 5–30 wt% Ni metal loadings were prepared by wetness impregnation method. Rice husk particles immersed in a solution containing Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (AR grade obtained from M/s. Loba Chemie, India) were heated on a hot plate at 353 K, while stirring at a rate of 300–350 rpm until complete dryness. The prepared catalysts were dried overnight at 373 K in oven and calcined at 723 K for 5 h in N2 gas flow. The prepared catalysts Ni/Rice husk carbon-silica was designated as XNRHCS where ‘X’ represents the weight percent of Ni. The rice husk derived carbon silica was designated as RHCS."
4,Characterization of the catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of the catalysts Ultima IV diffractometer (M/s. Rigaku Corporation, Japan) was used to record Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all the catalysts with a scanning rate of 0.02 using Ni filtered Cu Ka radiation (l ¼ 1.5406 Å) with a scan speed of 4° min−1 and a scan range of 10–80° at 40 kV and 20 mA. Quadrasorb SI adsorption unit (M/s. Quantachrome Instruments, USA) was used to get the BET surface area, pore size, and pore volume of all the catalysts by N2 adsorption-desorption at liquid N2 temperature. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies aimed to find out the reduction behavior of reducible species present in the catalyst was carried out on a homemade quartz reactor system. In the current case, TPR studies are helpful to find out reducing behavior of the nickel precursor and also metal support interaction if present. Prior to TPR analysis, the catalyst was heated to 413 K at a rate of 20 K min−1 in N2 flow and held for 30 min to eliminate the moisture followed by cooling to 313 K. While heating to 1073 K at a rate of 20 K min−1 in a flow of gas consisting of 5% H2 balance Argon (50 ml min−1), the TPR patterns were recorded on thermal conductivity equipped gas chromatograph (M/s. CIC Instruments, India) which was connected with standard GC software. The FTIR spectra of catalysts were recorded on a spectrum GX spectrometer (M/s. Perkin- Elmer, Germany) in the scan range of 400–4000 cm−1. The amount of surface Ni sites was obtained by H2 chemisorption, measured on an AUTOSORB-iQ, an automated gas sorption pulse analyzer (M/s. Quantachrome Instruments, USA). Prior to chemisorption, the catalyst was reduced in-situ under pure H2 flow while heating up to 773 K with a heating rate of 10 K min−1, held for 2 h, followed by evacuation for 2 h, and cooling to 313 K. Multiple pulses of pure hydrogen (100 μL each time) were injected onto the catalyst through a septum with a gas tight syringe until saturation was observed. The details of H2 pulse chemisorption experiments and the calculation procedure was cited in our earlier publication [31]. For SEM coupled EDAX analysis, samples are mounted on an aluminum support using a double adhesive tape, coated with gold in HUS-SGB vacuum coating unit and observed in JEOL S-7610F SEM unit. The TGA analysis was performed on a Mettler Toledo apparatus. With a sample weight of ca 30–40 mg, the tests were performed under air in the temperature ranging from 25 °C to 800 °C and with the ramping rate of 10 °C/min."
5,Activity test,"2.4 Activity test Catalytic tests were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor (14 mm id and 300 mm long) at atmospheric pressure. In each catalytic run, mixture of 1 g of the catalyst and same amount of the quartz particles were loaded at the centre of the reactor. Above the catalyst bed, a quartz bead which acts as preheating zone was placed. Prior to the reaction, the NRHCS catalyst has been reduced at 773 K for 4 h in a H2 flow of 30 cm3 min−1. Then the temperature was brought down to the reaction temperature where the liquid reactant (LA or FAL) was continuously fed at a flow rate of 1 cm3 h−1 using a syringe feed pump (M/s. B. Braun, Germany) with a WHSV = 1 h−1 along with H2 gas flow. The product mixture was collected in an ice trap at hourly intermissions and the components present in the mixture was quantified in a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped gas chromatograph, GC-17A (M/s. Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) and confirmed by GC-MS, QP-5050 (M/s. Shimadzu Instruments, Japan)."
6,Results and discussion,"Calcination of rice husk in air yields silica which was used as a support for Cu and Ni based catalysts for various dehydrogenation reactions [35–37]. There were reports for the preparation of SiO2 and carbon from rice husk [38,39]. In the current study, rice husk has been used to prepare carbon-silica composite material. There are few reports for the preparation of carbon-silica composites from rice husk [40]. XRD graph of carbon-silica composite derived from rice husk (Fig. 2 (a) indicates 2θ signals at ~34 (1 0 1), 38 (1 0 3) and 72° (3 1 1) due to the presence of SiC phase (JCPDS No. 89-1396) and 2θ signals at ~27 (002 & 101), 44 (1 0 1) and 77° (1 1 0) due to the presence graphitized carbon (JCPDS card 75-2078). However chances of presence of amorphous SiO2 may not be ruled out because the broad signal at 2θ value of ~27° also represents SiO2 phase. The EDAX elemental composition of C, Si and O respectively at 24.5%, 26.7% and 48.7% indicates the presence SiO2 in major concentrations because each Si requires two oxygen atoms and the rest of Si might be in the form of SiC in minor composition. Remaining carbon might be in the form of graphitized carbon phase in major composition. It is attractive to observe the absence of graphitized carbon 2θ 44, (103 &110) and SiC phases in the XRD patterns of supported Ni catalysts. Carbon-silica supported Ni catalysts when subjected to calcination in inert atmosphere (N2 flow) formation of metallic Ni clusters are possible because the carbon moiety acts as reducing agent and these results are in line with those reported in the literature [41]. The intensity of XRD signals due metallic Ni is lower at higher Ni loading i.e., 30 wt%. Presence NiO phase (111, 200 & 220) can be seen in the XRD patterns of 25NRHCS and 30NRHCS catalysts. The lower intensity of Ni in these catalysts thus can be ascribed to the presence of NiO phase (JCPDS No. 78-0429). In the XRD analysis of 15NRHCS, broad peaks at 37 and 65° may are due to the presence of SiC phase. XRD patterns of reduced NRHCS catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The results indicate the presence of XRD signals at 2θ values of 44 (1 1 1), 53° (2 0 0) and 76.73 (2 2 0) which suggest the presence of metallic Ni crystallites with FCC structure exists (JCPDS No.04–1508). The broad peak noticed in both calcined and reduced catalysts at a 2θ value of 22° corresponds to amorphous silica [48]. Table 1 indicates decrease in the BET surface area of RHCS upon Ni loading which is a common phenomenon due to pore blockage by Ni particles. The number of active sites (nm) as measured by H2 pulse chemisorption is an indication of the number Ni sites which actually involve in the reaction. These number of active Ni sites continuously increases with increase in Ni loading. However, the Ni dispersion increases with Ni loading, reaches a maximum value of 6.4% at 15 wt% NRHCS catalyst and decreases thereafter. The decrease in Ni dispersion beyond 15% Ni loading is due to the formation bigger Ni particles. Generally in majority of catalytic reactions, smaller the metal particle, higher is the activity [61]. Hence, one can assume that 15NRHCS would perform better in the LA/FAL hydrogenation compared to the other Ni catalysts. The FTIR spectrum of the RHCS is shown in Fig. 4 . This figure displays a broad band at about 3400 and 2920 cm−1 owing to the presence of both free and hydrogen bonded to OH groups and Si-OH group on the adsorbent surface. This stretching can be either due to the silanol groups (Si-OH) or adsorbed water (peak at 3430 cm−1) on the catalyst surface [42]. A signal in between 2940 and 2820 cm−1 is due to the stretching of OH groups connected to methyl radicals. Similarly, peaks around 1470 cm−1 are indicative of –CH2 and –CH3 groups whereas those at 1380 cm−1 are indicative of –CH3 groups. The IR spectra signify weak and broad peaks at around 1600 cm−1 related to –CO and -C-OH groups stretching from aldehydes and ketones. The transmittance in the range of 1050–1300 cm−1 is endorsed to the vibration of the CO group in lactones [43]. The peak at about 1300 cm−1 band could be credited to the aromatic CH and carboxyl carbonate structures [44] or silanol groups, similar to those present in silica acid (-Si-O-Si-OH) [45]. The peak at around 1100 cm−1 is owing to Si-O-Si and -C-O-H stretching and –OH deformation. The existence of polar groups over the surface is to be expected to furnish significant cation exchange capacity. The peak at about 786 cm−1 is ascribed to Si-C. With increase in the loading of metal ions the shifting of the peaks is observed from about 3854, 3743, 2877, 1546, 1387, 1213, 1094, 794 and 466 cm−1. This means that the functional groups at these wave numbers contribute in the metal adsorption. The shifting occurs both to higher and lower wave numbers. It was reported that the FTIR spectra for Cd-loaded RHA shows the disappearance of bonds around 2900 and 1636 cm−1 and shifting of bands about 1092, 792 and 468 cm−1 to lower wave numbers [46]. Such disappearance of bands is not found in the Ni loaded RHCS spectra, although the shifting of all the bands is visible. These characteristics specify that –CO, –OH, -Si-OH, -Si-C, -Si-H and -C-OH groups are effective in the adsorption Ni(II) onto RHCS [46]. TPR profiles of RHCS and NRHCS catalysts are placed in Fig. 5 . In the TPR spectra of all the samples a negative peak in the range of 773–973 K due to the gasification of H2 rich carbon moiety (CHx moiety) generated through the pyrolysis of RHA is observed. The appearance of negative or positive signal in the TPR pattern of carbon containing samples generally depends on the H2 content in the sample. H2-rich CHx yields negative signal and H2-lean CHx yields positive signal in the TPR patterns [47–49]. The reduction of the NiO species was observed at temperature range (473–813 K). In harmony with previous reports, the peak at lower temperature (<673 K) was described to the reduction of bulk NiO particles, whereas the peak at higher temperatures is a consequence of the reduction of smaller NiO particles or NiO particles with strong support interactions [50]. However, the reduction pretreatment performed at 773 K fully reduces the NiO particles on the SiO2 support. Three peaks at – 473 K, – 673 K and – 773 K were resolved in the TPR images. The low temperature peak at – 473 K was related with the presence of Ni3+ and had little influence on the subsequent reduction profile. The peak at −673 K was connected with the reduction of bulky nickel oxide crystallites in the fine pores of the silica, with little or no interaction with the support. The peak at – 773 K was linked with the reduction of small nickel oxide crystallites strongly attached to the support in the pores of the silica. The activity of the catalyst for hydrogenation of levulunic acid and furfural generally depends on the proportion of the 773 K TPR peak, because this reduction signal largely yields smaller nickel particles [51]. In the case of supported Ni catalysts, increase in the calcinations temperature from 673 K to 1073 K shifts the Tmax from 723 K to 973 K due to solid state reactions between NiO and the support ensuing in the formation of silicates or aluminates [52,53]. The TPR profiles of the Ni/RHCS differ considerably compared to those of the conventional supported NiO catalysts. Calcination of the Ni/RHCS catalysts at 723 K in presence of nitrogen flow results in the formation of easily reducible nickel oxide species as is shown from the lower Tmax in the TPR patterns. After the formation of metallic nickel, a second sharp peak arises at elevated temperatures (973 K). This signal may be due to the formation of Ni3Si. In the TPR pattern of 15NRHCS, a broad shoulder peak appearing at 973 K is due to the presence of nickel silicates. 3 Ni s + SiC s ↔ Ni 3 Si s + C s Similar solid state reactions have been reported by Chou et al., who reported extensive decomposition of SiC [54]. The effect of Ni loading on the conversion of furfural can be found in Fig. 8 A. 71% conversion of furfural with 91% selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol was achieved over 5NRHCS. As the Ni loading increases from 5 to 10 wt%, there is not drastic variation in the conversion of furfural. Further increase in Ni loading to 15 wt%, higher conversion of furfural (97.8%) with 96.7% selectivity to the furfuryl alcohol is observed. On further increase of Ni loading, we noted a decline in the conversion of furfural which could be ascribed to the decrease in the Ni dispersion. Among all the catalysts, 15NRHCS showed best catalytic performance. The influence of Ni loading on the conversion of levulinic acid can be found in Fig. 8B. About 53% conversion of levulinic acid with 91% selectivity to γ-valerolactone (GVL) was achieved over 5 NRHCS. As the Ni loading increases from 5 to 10 wt%, we observed an increase in conversion of levulinic acid (75%) with 93% selectivity to GVL. On further increase in Ni loading, we noted full conversion of levulinic acid with 98% selectivity to γ-valerolactone over 15NRHCS. Thus, in both the reactions, 15 wt% Ni is optimum in yielding good hydrogenation products. On the other hand, we carried out the catalytic activity over SiO2 support derived from rice husk, which yielded mild (≤10%) LA and furfural conversion at better reaction conditions with H2 as carrier gas. The supported Ni catalysts were known for the dissociative chemisorption of H2 in hydrogenation reaction like levulinic acid. In this situation also, both the reactants such as furfural and levulinic acid, the key reactive functional group is ketone. The selected catalytic system is helpful in the dissociation of one of the reactant like H2, further transfer of one of the dissociated hydrogen to the reactive group such as unsaturated carbonyl group of FAL resulting in the formation of intermediate, which on further transfer of remaining hydrogen to the intermediate results to produce FOL. Effect of reaction temperature on furfural hydrogenation over 15NRHCS catalyst was sketched in Fig. 9 A. As the temperature increases from 453 to 543 K over 15NRHCS catalyst, we noticed a decrease in the conversion as well as selectivity to furfuryl alcohol. The increase in selectivity to other products via furan which could be obtained through the decarbonylation of furfural and complete hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, methylfuran was noticed at higher temperature. It can be inferred that the 453 K is an optimum temperature for obtaining the excellent conversion of furfural. Effect of reaction temperature on levulinic acid hydrogenation over 15NRHCS catalyst was shown in Fig. 9B. We noticed full LA conversion at 523 K with 98% selectivity to γ- valerolactone. As the temperature increases from 523 to 568 K over 15NRHCS catalyst, decrease in conversion as well as selectivity to γ-valerolactone was noticed. It can be inferred that the 523 K is an optimum temperature for obtaining the excellent conversion of levulinic acid. Thus for furfural and levulinic acid hydrogenations, over 15NRHCS, the optimum reaction temperatures are 453 and 523 K respectively. The time on stream study was performed over a period of 10 h under optimized reaction parameters (453 K for furfural hydrogenation and 523 K for levulinic acid hydrogenation) over 15NRHCS catalyst. The results were displayed in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10A reveals that slight decrease in conversion of FAL from 99 to 86% was noted during the course of time on stream which could be attributed to the coking and/or fouling of reactive intermediate. Fig. 10B reveals that a slight decrease up to 3rd hour and steady LA conversion thereafter was noted during the course of time on stream which could be attributed to the coking and/or fouling of reactive intermediate. To find out the reason for the decline in the activity during time on stream, the spent catalysts were subjected to various characterization techniques. TPR pattern of used catalyst (collected after furfural hydrogenation) reveals the absence of Ni precursor reduction peak which is an indication of presence of Ni in the metallic state. Spent catalysts collected after FAL and LA hydrogenation were subjected to XRD investigation and found the presence of crystallite Ni phase similar to that of reduced catalyst. There is not much variation in the intensity of the diffraction signals due to Ni0 phases which clearly states that deactivation is not due to Ni agglomeration. CHNS analysis confirmed the formation of coking on both the catalyst collected after FAL and LA hydrogenation reactions.From TGA and CHNS analysis we investigated mid coke deposition on spent catalysts of levulinic acid and furfural hydrogenation reactions as illustrated in Fig. 6. On the other hand, EDS and SEM images of bare rice husk catalysts were depicted in Fig. 7A–C. From these images, we observed higher fraction of Si and mild fraction of carbon along with trace level Ca and Mg metals in the rice husk catalyst. During the furfural hydrogenation 3.45% of CO was detected, which is due to decomposition of product/reactant molecules. On the other hand, negligible fraction of CO was observed in levulinic acid hydrogenation. The rate of conversion of the reactant or rate of formation of product can be defined by several ways. Few of them are Quasi Turn over Frequency (QTOF), Turn over Frequency (TOF) and Productivity rate. QTOF can be defined as the rate of conversion of the reactant molecules per second per Ni atom. It is derived as follows: QTOF = [ Flow rate of reactant cm 3 sec - 1 × Density of reactant gr cm - 3 × reactant Conversion % × Weight percent of Ni i n the catalyst ] / [ Formula weight of reactant × Atomic weight of Ni × weight o f the catalyst × 100 × 100 ] TOF on the other hand can be defined as the rate of conversion reactant molecules per second per active Ni atom. It can be easily derived from QTOF (QTOF × 100/percentage Ni Dispersion). Generally both QTOF and TOF decrease in exponential decay fashion against Ni loading. In order to get a straight line portion against Ni loading, a plot between log (1/QTOF) versus Ni loading will be drawn. Similarly, a plot between log (1/TOF) versus Ni loading yields a straight line. Fig. 11B is the straight line graph between log (1/QTOF) versus Ni loading for both FAL and LA hydrogenations. The value on the Y-Axis at 15% Ni loading is very close indicating that on this catalyst (15% NRHCS), the QTOF values for both FAL (0.427 × 10−5, Table 2 ) and LA (0.436 × 10−5, Table 2) hydrogenations are more or less same. If the straight lines are extrapolated to Y-axis, an intercept is obtained. The intercept thus obtained is nothing but activity per site assuming that all Ni atoms (both bulk and surface) participate in the hydrogenation reaction. The QTOF values obtained from the intercept are 1.38 × 10−5 and 1.0 × 10−5 for with respect to FAL and LA conversions respectively. Similarly the TOF values derived from the number active sites obtained from H2 pulse chemisorption technique is plotted in the graph between log (1/TOF) versus Ni loading (Fig. 11A ). The TOF values at 15% Ni loading are 6.72 × 10−5 and 6.8 × 10−5 for FAL and LA conversions respectively (Table 2). In the case of Y-axis intercepts, these values are 36.3 × 10−5 and 26.3 × 10−5 for FAL and LA conversions respectively (Table 2). Since in the calculation of TOF, only surface Ni sites are considered, this value is always higher than that of QTOF which is derived from the total Ni content in the catalyst. The rate of production of FOL and GVL (Table 2) are 0.96 kg/kg of catalyst/h and 0.84 kg/kg catalyst/h respectively. The performance of 15NRHCS catalyst has been compared with other catalysts cited in the literature for both FAL (Table 3 ) and LA (Table 4 ) hydrogenation respectively. The results clearly indicate that the activity of 15NRHCS catalyst is either on par or higher when compared with those cited in the literature."
7,Conclusions,"The RHCS sample prepared by pyrolysis at 873 K has been used as a support in the preparation of Ni doped RHCS catalysts and these catalysts have been utilized for the hydrogenation of furfural and levulinic acid respectively in vapor phase and at atmospheric pressure. Better catalytic performances were noticed in hydrogenation of furfural and levulinic acid over 15NRCHS catalyst due to high dispersion and finer particle size of Ni. These catalysts were exhibited better activity results than reported catalysts. Herein, rice husk carbon silica material emerged as unique support for better catalytic activity when compared to individual support materials (carbon and silica). Moreover, carbons present in these catalysts maintain the metallic Ni particles during hydrogenation reaction, which results in achievement of maximum selectivity of desired products. Moreover, silica possessed rice husk catalyst retard the higher coke deposition on active species of the catalyst, therefore afforded maximum conversion at optimal reaction conditions."
