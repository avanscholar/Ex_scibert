0,Introduction,"Nowadays, due to depleting petroleum supplies and the climate change, much attention has been paid to the development of clean and renewable energies [1]. Hydrogen (H2), as a result of environmental friendliness and renewable properties, has been proposed to be an ideal energy carrier for hydrogen economy. To realize future hydrogen economy, efficient and convenient hydrogen generation was a basic prerequisite. Among the numerous methods for preparing hydrogen, water electrolysis represented a more renewable, cleaner and more efficient technique for hydrogen fabrication without other further problems. To enable market uptake and to deploy electrolyzers on a large scale, it was important to design and synthesis of high-performance and low-cost electrocatalysts to promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [2,3]. Up to now, many research works have been dedicated to develop HER catalysts, such as CoMo [4], W2N [5], MoC [6,7], MoS2 [8–19], WS2 [20,21], MoP [22–25], Mo2C [26–29], Co-P [30–34], and Fe-P [35,36] to replace the commonly used platinum group catalysts. In the past several years, due to metallic nickel owned the largest HER exchange current density, lower overpotentials and faster kinetics for HER among the non-noble metals, which had attracted much attention in catalyze HER [37–39]. However, it was well known that the non-noble metal catalysts were susceptible to corrosion under strong acid or alkaline conditions and tend to aggregate into larger particles during catalytic cycling [40]. In order to set around the problem, a large number of groups had focused on Ni-N HER catalysts with different nanostructures, where the catalytic performance toward HER comprehensively was investigated [41–45]. Shalom et al.[46] prepared Ni3N on the Ni foam (NF) matrix through solid state synthesis method, which exhibited a five-fold increase of the electrochemically active for the HER in alkaline solution than that of NF. Further, Jin and co-worker showed that upload the Ni3N/Ni4N heterojunction on Zn0.5Cd0.5S could greatly delay the recombination of electron hole pairs and accelerate the migration of photocarriers for improving HER activity [47]. Although lots of methods have been now developed to prepare Ni-based HER catalysts, however, the synthetic procedures were complicated and expensive, thus leading to the final products own high cost, afterward the yield and quality of catalysts were inadequate to meet commercial requirements. In addition, their overpotential for hydrogen evolution and long-time stability still needs to be improved to compete with the noble metal catalysts. Here, we reported a very facile, low cost and straightforward strategy of physical vapor process to fabricate nickel nitride (Ni3N/Ni4N) nanostructure on NF substrate (NixN/NF, x = 3, 4), which used as cost-effective cathodes for HER with excellent performance. The cathode was specially obtained by direct plasma-enhanced nitridation of commercially available NF without any pretreatment steps and complicated chemical reactions. Moreover, compared with conventional N-atmosphere (such as azides, hydrazine, and ammonia) synthesis, the used nitrogen source of NixN/NF nanostructures was N2 precursor during physical vapor process, which was totally environmentally friendly and without any hazardous. The prepared NixN/NF cathode exhibited a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec−1 and the best HER overpotential 97 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the NixN/NF could sustain for up to 24 h at a constant overpotential of 97 mV with only 6.5% decrease and keep its original morphology, showing good long-term durability toward HER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to shed light on the exceptional performance of NixN/NF. It was showed that the interfacial sites of Ni3N–N and Ni4N–Ni have smaller values of Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) for H adsorption–desorption, which were very close to the ideal value of 0 eV."
1,Materials and experimental methods,
2,Preparation of NixN/NF,"2.1 Preparation of NixN/NF The synthesis of NixN on NF, NixN/NF (x = 3, 4) electrocatalysts was carried out in a home-made physical vapor ion beam deposition equipment. NF was purchased from Changsha Lyrun New Material Co., Ltd, China (110 ppi, 0.3 mm thick). Prior to nitriding, NF with an area of 2.0 cm × 3.0 cm were washed sequentially by acetone, alcohol and deionized water. After dried with nitrogen gas, the Ni foams were loaded into the vacuum chamber of ion beam deposition equipment and subjected to the nitrogen plasmas for the in-situ synthesis of NixN. Nitrogen plasma was produced by ion beam with voltage of −2500 V. The substrate negative bias voltage was −500 V, and the temperature was set at 500 °C during nitriding process. The NF was nitriding with different time (4, 8, 12, 16 h) and the obtained samples were named NixN/NF-4, NixN/NF-8, NixN/NF-12 and NixN/NF-16, respectively."
3,Characterization of NixN/NF samples,2.2 Characterization of NixN/NF samples The microstructure of the NixN/NF was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The phase structure of prepared samples was performed on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis was carried out on a field emission transmission electron microscopy using in a Talos F200 at the operating voltage of 200 keV. The chemical composition of the NixN/NF samples was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
4,Electrochemical characterization of NixN/NF and NF,"2.3 Electrochemical characterization of NixN/NF and NF All electrochemical characterizations of samples were performed in a conventional three-electrode system by the Gamry electrochemical workstation at temperature ~25 °C. The electrolyte was 1 M KOH. The as prepared NixN/NF and NF as the working electrodes, a graphite stick as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. All the potentials in the experiment were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) from the following equation: (S1) E R H E = E A g / A g C l + 0.194 + 0.05916 × p H The electrochemical stability of the catalyst was evaluated by chronoamperometry test under a constant overpotential of 97 mV for 24 h. Moreover, all polarization curves without iR-corrected."
5,DFT calculations,"2.4 DFT calculations All the pristine and adsorption models were simulated based DFT calculations via Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) code. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) approach was implemented [48,49]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation function was applied. The cutoff energy of the plane-wave basis was set as 400 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled by Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh centered at the Г point, along with the reciprocal lattice spacing ≤ 0.03 Å−1. The structure relaxation was carried out until it reached the convergence tolerance, i.e. the energy and force on each atom were respectively 1 × 10−4 eV/atom and 0.05 eV/Å. The valence electron configurations were 1s 1 of H, 2s 22p 3 of N and 3d 84s 2 of Ni. The optimized Ni or Ni4N or Ni3N bulk cells were used to construct surface slab models. The ΔGH* was expressed as [43] (S2) Δ G H ∗ = Δ E H ∗ + Δ E ZPE - T Δ S where ΔEH* was adsorption energy at each hydrogen adsorption site, ΔEZPE was the difference of the zero-point energy between the adsorbed hydrogen and hydrogen in the gas phase, and ΔS was entropy change of H* adsorption. Because of the entropy of hydrogen in absorbed state could not be ignored, ΔS could be employed as −1/2 S0 (S0 is the entropy of H2 in the gas phase at normal situation, 1 bar of H2 and pH = 0 at 300 K). Thus, the free energy corresponding to the adsorbed state could be written as: (S3) Δ G H ∗ = Δ E H ∗ + 0.24 e V The ΔEH* could be calculated by: (S4) Δ E H ∗ = E sur - H - E sur - 1 / 2 E H 2 where Esur-H was the energy of slab with adsorbed hydrogen atom, Esur was the energy of clean slab and EH2 was the of molecular H2 in the gas phase."
6,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 showed the synthesis procedures of NixN/NF (x = 3, 4), and the details synthesis steps were given in material synthesis section. The pretreated NF was loaded into the physical vapor ion beam deposition equipment and subjected to the nitrogen plasma for different time (The detail synthesis conditions was showed in Table S1, supplementary information (SI)). Following the plasma-enhanced discharge nitridation, the surface of the NF changed to a little black from the initial bright silver (Fig. S1, SI). The SEM images of bare NF exhibited the typical sub-micron-scaled three-dimensional (3D) skeleton structure and smooth surface (Fig. S2, SI). After nitridation treatment, the NixN (x = 3, 4) array with well-preserved morphology were successfully prepared (Fig. 2 ). At the beginning, particles formed on the surface of NF, and as the nitriding time increased, the particles gradually became larger and more, until entire surfaces of the NF were covered. At the same time, the particles changed from round shape to peak-shapes gradually. Compared with smooth pristine NF, it was clearly that the NixN/NF covered with peak-shapes array could increase the specific surface area. In order to validate the crystallographic structures, the NixN/NF-12 and NF were performed by XRD showed in Fig. 3 a. All diffraction peaks of the NixN/NF-12 showed that the prapared NixN was composed of Ni3N (PDF# 10-0280) and Ni4N (PDF# 36-1300). The observed 2θ values at 38.94, 42.14, 58.51, 70.61 and 78.31 were corresponding to the (110), (002), (112), (300) and (113) of Ni3N, and those at 41.81 and 70.91 were attributed to the (111) and (220) of Ni4N, respectively. In addition, the XRD patterns of NixN/NF-4, NixN/NF-8 and NixN/NF-16 were also provided (Fig. S3, SI). XPS was further supplied to research the chemical composition and chemical valence states of the sample. From Fig. 3b, it was obviously that a typical N 1s was demonstrated at the peaks of 397.8 eV corresponded to the N–Ni bonds [50,51]. Fig. 3c showed the Ni 2p spectra, two peaks at 855.3 and 872.8 eV along with two satellite peaks at 861.1 eV and 879.5 eV were observed, which were corresponded to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 of Ni+, respectively [47]. Moreover, the less valence state of Ni (Ni < 1 + ) was appeared at 852.5 eV (2p3/2) and 869.5 eV (2p1/2) [43]. The emergence of Ni < 1 + suggested that the nitriding products not just contained Ni3N, which matched well with results in XRD. To further investigate the detail structure of the prepared catalyst, Fig. 3d presented the HRTEM images of NixN/NF-12. It was clearly seen that the lattice spacings of 0.203 nm corresponding to (011) planes of Ni were observed. The spacing of 0.214 nm and 0.231 nm assigned to the (002) and (110) plane of hexagonal Ni3N. In addition, the lattice spacing of 0.216 nm unambiguously assigned to (111) planes of Ni4N were also observed. Fig. 3e and f showed the results of bright-field scanning TEM and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, presenting that the Ni and N elements were clearly observed. To further demonstrate the distribution of the elemental distribution of NixN/NF-12, we used high-angle annular dark-field TEM (HAADF-TEM) and EDX mapping to characterize the sample (Fig. 3g–i). The elemental mappings clearly showed that the Ni and N elements distributed homogeneously, which revealed that the prepared NixN was uniform in composition. In summary, based on the XRD, XPS, and TEM characterizations, it has been clearly demonstrated that the NixN/NF (x = 3, 4) have been successfully fabricated by one step nitridation of commercially NF. To exhibit the advantages of the as-prepared catalysts, the electrocatalytic performance for HER of the NixN/NF under different nitriding time were evaluated. In Fig. 4 a, the typical LSV curves for NixN/NF along with bare NF for comparison. It was common knowledge that the overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10) was equivalent to 12.3% efficiency of a solar water-splitting device, so η10 was usually used to compare the performance of different catalysts, and a smaller η10 suggested a higher activity. Among the prepared samples, the NixN/NF-12 demonstrated the lowest overpotential of η10 = 97 mV, which was much lower than NixN/NF-4 (η10 = 124 mV), NixN/NF-8 (η10 = 103 mV), NixN/NF-16 (η10 = 118 mV) and as well as bare NF (η10 = 212 mV) (detailed data in Table S2, SI). And this was a marked low value compared with Ni-based catalysts as reported in previous literatures (Table S3, SI). As known to all, further increased potential in the cathodic potential resulted to a sharp rise in the current. The current densities of 20 mA cm−2 (η20) were also shown, the value order of the as prepared samples and NF were in accordance with the η10 results (Table S2, SI). It was suggested that the NixN/NF-12 had an overwhelming advantage in HER among the prepared NixN/NF and NF, which might be related to the surface full of peak-shapes structures with the largest specific surface area. It was obviously that NF after nitriding with 4 h, there were only a few particles on the surface (Fig. 2a-c), but the macro-porous morphology remains unchanged. When the time of nitriding change to 8 h, the more particles on the surface of NF than that of NixN/NF-4 but not enough to cover the entire surface (Fig. 2d-f). Therefore, we guessed that the nucleation of grains needed a certain amount of energy and time. However, the NF after nitriding with 16 h (Fig. 2j-m), the NF collapsed and unable to maintain the original 3D skeleton structure, which led to a smaller specific surface area. To give insight the change of specific surface area, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of as-synthesized catalysts were detected (Table S4, SI). The result showed that the NiXN/NF-12 owned the largest specific surface area (6.2433 m2/g), which was about 4.2 times that of NF (1.4669 m2/g). In order to evaluate the reaction kinetics of the samples, Fig. 4b presented the HER Tafel plots of the NF and the prepared NixN/NF. The linear regions of Tafel curves were fitted by the Tafel equation: η = a + b log j (where a, b, and j were Tafel constant, Tafel slope and current density), yielded apparent Tafel slopes of 195, 164, 73, 69 and 156 mVdec−1 for the NF, NixN/NF-4, NixN/NF-8, NixN/NF-12 and NixN/NF-16 (Table S2, SI). As expected, the NixN/NF-12 exhibited the smallest Tafel slope, which was better than previous reported electrocatalysts (Table S3, SI). Furthermore, as known to all that the Tafel slope between at the scope of 40–120 mV dec−1, meaning that the reaction of the NixN/NF-12 follow the Volmer–Heyrovsky regulation (Fig. 6 c) [2,31,52]. In addition, to further obtain insight into the HER process and mechanism with the NixN/NF, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization of the NixN/NF and NF cathodes were performed at an overpotential of η = 200 mV (Fig. 4c). As shown in Nyquist plots, NixN/NF-12 exhibited the smallest charge transfer resistance, which suggested a highly efficient in the HER process as well as fast electronic transmission. The result was in good agreement with the observation of LSV curves and Tafel plots. In addition to the catalytic activity, stability was another important indicator to be evaluated for the potential practical applications of a HER catalyst. Fig. 4d presented that NixN/NF-12 could maintain η10 = 97 mV for 24 h with only 6.5% reduction, showing the excellent durability. In order to clearly understand the working situation of NixN/NF-12 catalyst, digital photos of the evolution of hydrogen bubble from the catalyst surface performed at the potential of −0.58 V were shown (Fig. S4). It was obviously that there was no hydrogen bubbles evolution on the catalyst surface before voltage supply, and the electrolyte around was transparent (Fig. S4a). Contrary, when the power was switched on, the hydrogen bubbles were intensively generated from the electrode surface (Fig. S4b). For further investigate the stability of the NixN/NF-12 catalyst, the surface morphology after the LSV and CA mode was characterized by SEM (Fig. S5). It obviously that the catalyst still maintains a good 3D frame structure, and more interesting is that the peak-shapes remained on the surface (The substance in the red circle may be KOH that has not been cleaned). Gaining insight into the mechanisms of HER was not only of scientific importance but also beneficial for rationally guiding the design of high-performance catalysts. In order to shed light on the superior activity of NixN/NF (X = 3, 4) as a HER electrocatalyst, DFT calculations were performed on model systems. The detailed parameters and method for the calculations were shown in DFT calculations. (111) lattice plane of Ni4N was selected for simulation according to the HRTEM and XRD results. Thus, the slab sliced along (111) lattice plane and terminated with Ni atoms (Ni4N-Ni) and N atoms (Ni4N-N) was constructed. For Ni4N-Ni, there were six sites for the adsorption of H atom (top, bridge, bridge-N, hollow, hollow-Ni and hollow-N), while there were three sites for Ni4N-N (top, bridge and hollow) (Fig. 5a). According to previous report [41,53], we reasoned an appropriate structure for Ni3N and Ni. For Ni3N surface, a N or Ni-terminated 2 × 2 Ni3N (001) slab of 10 layers was constructed (Fig. 5b). Moreover, a 4 × 4 Ni (111) surface slab model of 5 layers was also present, with the bottom 2 layers of atoms fixed to simulate Ni bulk (Fig. 5c). All the adsorption H* are settled at 3-fold hollow site. In view of the Sabatier principle [54], the catalyst possessed a moderate ΔGH* could show excellent hydrogen evolution performance. The closer the ΔGH* to zero, the better advantage to both the H* adsorption and H2 desorption process for the hydrogen evolution [55]. The resulting changes ΔGH* of Ni4N-Ni, Ni4N-N, Ni3N-Ni, Ni3N-N and Ni were calculated (Table S5, SI), as presented in Fig. 6a and b. The calculated results clearly showed that the Ni3N and Ni4N provided the smaller ΔGH* than that of Ni (-0.384 eV), especially the Ni4N-Ni gave the lowest ΔGH* of −0.056 eV. In other word that because of NixN composed of Ni4N, the catalytic activities of the NixN/NF further improved. The DFT simulations showed no difference with the experimental results that NixN/NF (x = 3, 4) owned a significantly improved HER performance (including significantly Tafel slope and reduced overpotential) comparable to the NF in basic condition. Fig. 6d showed the diagrammatic sketch of the enhanced HER mechanism by the Ni3N and Ni4N. Based on the above results, the exceptional HER electrocatalytic activity of the NixN/NF might be ascribed. At first, compared with the smooth NF, the catalyst owned the 3D microporous full covered with particles or peak-shapes array, which not only increased the contact area with the solution but also maximized the number of exposed active sites. Second, the intercalation of negatively charged nitrogen atoms into metal Ni could expand the metal lattice and broaden the d-band, which gave priority to increase the contraction of the d-band and the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level [56,57], the redistributions of the DOS were beneficial to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Third, the prepared NixN composed of Ni4N and Ni3N. Based on the nanostructure of Ni4N and Ni3N from Fig. 3d, we speculated that the charge redistribution occurred between Ni4N and Ni3N at the interface region. And the change of average valance charge for Ni site near the Ni4N–Ni3N interface was beneficial in transforming the electronic structure of Ni to resemble that of noble metals, which could be helpful for hydrogen desorption to improve the electrochemical activity [47]. In other words, there might that the synergistic effect between Ni4N and Ni3N contributed to the excellent electrochemical performance. The reasons came to the conclusion from the catalytic activities of the bicomponent NixN/NF (x = 3, 4), which was higher than those of the Ni3N from previous report [46,58]."
7,Conclusions,"In a summary, NixN (x = 3, 4) on NF were successfully synthesized by a one-step route via direct nitriding method using nitrogen discharge plasma in physical vapor deposition system. This novel method for the synthesis of the Ni-based nitrides enabled an intimate contact between the active materials and the electrode substrate. The fabricated NixN/NF (x = 3, 4) exhibited an excellent catalytic performance used as a cathode for HER in alkaline condition. The DFT theoretical calculations confirmed that Ni3N and Ni4N possessed smaller ΔGH* than that of Ni for both the H* adsorption and H2 desorption, which were account to the enhanced HER catalytic performance of NixN/NF. Moreover, the direct nitridation of NF by N2 offered a simple and low-cost approach to synthesis HER cathodes compared with previous methods. This novel method could be readily up-scaled and eco-friendly, because of the cost-effectiveness and commercial availability both of NF and N2. More importantly, the method could be easily extended to synthesize other metal nitride used for catalytic reaction."
