0,Introduction,"In recent decades, researchers have sought to develop new technologies for the production of bio-fuels and other chemical materials, because of the depletion of fossil energy and increasing pollution [1–3]. Bio-oil is a promising bio-fuel and can be obtained from biomass fast pyrolysis. However, bio-oil produced through this process contains a variety of oxygenic functional groups, including ketone, aldehyde, carboxy and some other groups [4,5]. Among the complex oxygenated compounds in bio-oil, furfural (FFR) particularly requires to be stabilized due to the main disadvantage of its high reactivity [6,7]. Research efforts have been made in developing environmentally friendly catalysts for FFR hydrogenation to improve bio-oil heating value and stabilize the bio-oil [8]. In previous studies, various solvents have been investigated in FFR hydrogenation. The high yield of target products furfuryl alcohol (FFA) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) could be obtained in strong polar solvents [9]. Although ethanol as a solvent increases the chances of formation of byproducts, it has the obvious advantages of high activity and solubility. Ethanol as a solvent enables FFR to be transformed to FFA, THFA and deep hydrogenation products such as 2-methylfuran and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. The main byproduct in this process is 2-furaldehyde diethyl acetal (FDA) which would be easily produced in ethanol solvent (shown in Fig. 1 ). In chemical industry, both FFA and THFA have potential use for chemicals manufacturing, e.g. synthetic fiber and green solvent [10–14]. Various heterogeneous catalysts have been proved to be efficient in the hydrogenation of FFR to FFA/THFA either in gas phase or in liquid phase (Tables S1 and S2). FFA has wide industrial application in preparation of THFA, resins, synthetic fibers and chemical intermediate for the production of perfume and vitamin [15–18]. Conventional FFA manufacture hydrogenates FFR over copper chromite catalyst (CuCr2O4·CuO; Cu–Cr) at approximately 180°C and 70–100bar pressure using batch reactors [19]. One major disadvantage of this method is the requirement of high hydrogen pressure (70–100bar). Furthermore, toxicity of these catalysts due to the presence of chromium is another drawback. Noble metal catalysts exhibit higher activity of catalyzing hydrogenation. Platinum is known as effective catalyst in FFR hydrogenation, and especially facilitates in the partial hydrogenation reactions of FFR to FFA by CO hydrogenation [20]. Bhogeswararao and Srinivas [21] proposed that Pt (10wt%) supported over γ-Al2O3, under 25°C and 60bar pressure of hydrogen, obtained 65.6wt% conversion of FFR with 99.7wt% selectivity towards FFA. As reported by Wang et al. [11], the hydrogenation performance of Pt/MWNT for FFA production has been investigated. The 5.0wt% Pt catalyst showed the best performance. The FFA yield could reach 75.0% under 150°C and 20bar pressure for 5h. Additionally, in order to make catalysts more cost-efficient, promoters are often used in catalyst preparation, e.g. Pt/Ti–Al2O3, Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3, Pt–Co/C [22–24]. As far as we are concerned, research on the utilization of Pt based bimetallic catalysts with a low loading (0.5wt%) of Pt for FFA synthesis is scarce. THFA is usually regarded as a green solvent and has wide application in preparation of 1, 5-pentanediols, printing inks, agricultural applications and electronics cleaners [21,25]. Latest research interests concentrate on the direct hydrogenation of FFR to THFA. With respect to this, Nakagawa et al. [26] indicated that the Pd–Ir alloy (Pd: 2wt%, Pd/Ir=1) supported on SiO2 presented the best catalytical activity. Though in this process, conversion of FFR over 99% with 94% selectivity of THFA was achieved, disadvantages of relatively low reaction temperature (2°C) and high hydrogen pressure (80bar) hinder its further application. Recently, Chen et al. [9] showed their study on one-step hydrogenation to produce THFA using Ni–Pd alloy on TiO2–ZrO2 support. Bimetallic catalyst (Ni: 5wt%, Ni/Pd=5, mole ratio) exhibited the best catalytic hydrogenation result. The yield of THFA could reach 93.4% at 130°C and 50bar hydrogen pressure for 8h. As reported by Bhogeswararao et al. [21], the 5wt% Pd/Al2O3, under 25°C and 60bar pressure of hydrogen, acquired 79.5wt% conversion of FFR with 100wt% selectivity towards THFA. In our very recent study, given the unique structure and properties of MWNT, modified MWNT was utilized for supporting Cu–Ni alloy in liquid-phase of FFR hydrogenation. The Cu–Ni/MWNT provided superior performance with 90.3% yield of THFA under optimized condition at 130°C, 40bar pressure for 10h [27]. Here, we report the application of low amount loading (0.5wt%) of Pd supported on MWNT using transition metal as promoters to enhance the catalytic activity for direct hydrogenation of FFR to THFA in liquid phase. Additionally, based on our previous research, oxygenated functional groups such as carbonyl/carboxyl groups, and ester groups, are beneficial for metal dispersed on the surface of carbon materials (activated carbon and MWNT) [27,28]. Various promoters enhance the catalytic performance with added metal oxide e.g. Fe (Ш) [20], Sn [24], Co [29], Ni [30]. In this work, transition metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) was investigated as promoters using Pt–M/MWNT and Pd–M/MWNT (M represents transition metal) catalysts in ethanol as a solvent for furfural hydrogenation. The same role of iron and nickel playing in bimetallic catalysts and the different hydrogenation result over Pt–Fe/MWNT and Pd–Ni/MWNT catalysts were investigated emphatically. Moreover, reaction temperature and reaction time were fully discussed, and supports (MWNT, activated carbon, modified activated carbon, MgO, γ-Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) were also compared to further investigate the process of FFA or THFA formation."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Ethanol (purity>99.7%), HNO3 (68% purity), H2PtCl4·6H2O (>99.0%), H2PdCl4·6H2O (>99.0%), Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (>99.0%), Mn(NO3)2 (50.0%), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (>98.5%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (>98.5%), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (>98.0%) were provided by Sinopharm Co. Ltd. Furfural (99%), ZrO2 (99.99%, 50nm, 78m2/g), TiO2 (99.8%, 40nm, 90m2/g), γ-Al2O3 (99.9%, 20nm, 104m2/g), MgO (>99.0%, 50nm, 54m2/g), and activated carbon (AC) (>99.5%, 8–16mesh, 779m2/g) were bought from Aladdin Chemistry Co. Ltd. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (>95%) were provided by DK Nano Technology Corporation. The MWNT support was obtained from mixing raw MWNT (98m2/g) with HNO3 at 120°C for 4h by agitating magnetically. In this process, oxygenated functional groups can be formed on the surface of MWNT, and samples were purified with water until a final pH of 7.0 for the filtrate and dried at 100°C overnight. To investigate the acidic functionalization of the carbonaceous material, raw activated carbon was also used as a support. The modified AC was denoted as H-AC which was obtained from the same nitric acid treatment."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation Supported bimetallic Pt-based and Pd-based catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation method, and the mass fraction of the loaded palladium or platinum was 0.5wt% (Pt–M=1:1, Pd–M=1:1, molar ratio, M represents transition metal Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The modified MWNT was mixed with H2PtCl6 or H2PdCl4 and transition metal precursors in an aqueous solution, and followed by ultrasonic oscillation for about 10min. Then, the samples were impregnated for 24h, dried at 100°C overnight, and reduced at 400°C for 4h by H2."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization Specific surface area (SBET) was acquired based on adsorption data by TriStar II 3020 instrument. In prior to analysis, all reduced catalysts were degassed at 120°C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was obtained in the range of 20–80° on a Rigaku D/max-IIIB diffractometer with CuKa radiation at 40kV. The metal particle size on the surface of MWNT was observed by transmission electron microscopy: HT7700 microscope and around 100–150 particles were examined to make curves of particle size distribution. Pt, Pd and Fe were confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2100F). The sample was mixed with ethanol, sonicated, dripped on a copper-grid, and dried in the air. The reducibility of the catalysts was acquired by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) technique with GC-1690 instrument. In TPR measurement, a quartz tube was loaded with 100mg of catalyst. Sample was pretreated in 30mL/minN2 at 220°C for 30min and then cooled to −150°C. A gas mixture of 5% H2/Ar (30mL/min) was used for catalysts reduction at a heating rate of 10°C/min to 650°C. The total amount of hydrogen consumption was followed by a TCD detector to determine the reduction capacity of the catalyst. The H2 consumption per gram of samples was calibrated with a standard CuO powder (shown in Fig. S1). The acid sites of various supports were qualitatively measured by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia. In each experiment, 150mg of support was heated at 500°C under Ar flow for 2h. Then, it was saturated by a mixture of NH3 in Ar (30mL/min) at 50°C. The excess of ammonia was flushed out with Ar flow for 30min. Ammonia desorption was carried out at a heating rate of 10°C/min to 700°C. For activated carbon and modified MWNT supports, in order to eliminate the influence of surface functional groups decomposing, TPD measurement without the adsorption of NH3 was also carried out in the same condition. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the catalysts were carried out on a pH I5000c spectrometer using Al Kα radiation source (hν=1486.6eV) at 12.5kV, and the energy (BE) values were calibrated by the peak of C 1s line at 284.6eV."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests The selective hydrogenation of furfural in liquid phase was carried out in a 50mL stainless steel reactor. For each test, 0.5mL of furfural was hydrogenated over 0.1g of catalyst and 5.0mL of solvent (ethanol). In order to minimize the limitations by mass transfer steps, the effect of stirring speed on FFR conversion was studied. The results present that FFR conversion remains unchanged when the stirring speed is above 500rpm, suggesting a kinetics-controlled regime (see Fig. S2). Therefore, the stirring speed was set at 500rpm in this study. Before the reaction, the reactor was purified with hydrogen several times to replace the air in the setup and filled with 30bar H2. Hydrogenation process of furfural was under the conditions of certain temperature in desired time. Till the temperature decreased to 25°C, the liquid products were separated with catalysts and known by qualitative analysis of a FID gas chromatograph using HP-5 capillary column and GC–MS (HP 6890, 5973 MSD). Accurate calculation of conversion and selectivity was in consistent with previous method [27,28] and defined as following, with errors in reported conversion and selectivity of ±4.5%. (1) C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = m o l ( F F R , i n ) − m o l ( F F R , o u t ) m o l ( F F R , i n ) × 100 % (2) S e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) = m o l ( p r o d u c t ) m o l ( F F R , i n ) × C on . × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalytic performance over Pt-based and Pd-based catalysts,"3.1 Catalytic performance over Pt-based and Pd-based catalysts Gallezot and Richard [31] suggested that the catalytic performance in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes hydrogenation can be enhanced over Pt-based catalyst when adding a second metal as the promoter. In this research, an alloy of Pt or Pd and promoter was simply formed by co-impregnation method. Some transition metals were investigated as promoters, and the hydrogenation result is presented in Table 1 . A FFR conversion of 24.1% is obtained in the presence of MWNT and no production of FFA or THFA was observed. The low conversion of FFR is attributed to the acetalization between FFR and ethanol, which also has been observed using SBA-15 for blank experiment for FFR hydrogenation [32]. Numerous typical byproduct of FDA would occur over monometallic Pt and Pd catalyst. All of the promoters (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) screened show positive effect on FFR hydrogenation at 100°C, 30bar hydrogen for 5h, and especially introducing Fe and Ni improves FFR conversion and FFA or THFA selectivity, respectively. Consequently, bimetallic catalysts Pt–Fe/MWNT, Pt–Ni/MWNT, Pd–Fe/MWNT and Pd–Ni/MWNT would be fully investigated. Furthermore, it should be noted that Pt-based catalysts are selective to FFA formation (CO hydrogenated product), while THFA is likely to be produced through CC and CO hydrogenation of FFR over Pd-based catalysts. The high conversion and selectivity driven by promoters could be considered from two aspects: one is the catalytic active sites interacting with promoters [33,34], the other may be attributed to the electron contributions from the promoters to Pt and Pd because of the alloy [35], which would be interpreted by the following experiments."
8,Influence of reaction temperature,"3.2 Influence of reaction temperature According to earlier studies, researchers have proved that it was prone to produce n-butanol, 2-methylfuran furan in high temperature [14,21]. Hence, temperature in the range of 25–130°C has been fully investigated as shown in Fig. 2 . Bimetallic Pt-based and Pd-based catalysts exhibit higher catalytic activity compared to monometallic catalysts at 5h under 30bar hydrogen. With respect to Pt-based catalysts, monometallic Pt/MWNT shows relatively poor catalytic activity and selectivity, producing a higher level of 2-furaldehyde diethyl acetal (FDA, from acetal reaction of furfural with ethanol) from 25°C to 130°C (Figs. 2, S3c). The Pt–Fe/MWNT and Pt–Ni/MWNT catalysts demonstrate a similar trend to each other for the conversion of FFR with reaction temperature. As reaction temperature rises from 25 to 100°C, the significant increase to over 95% in FFR conversion has been acquired. When temperature keeps on increasing to 130°C, FFR conversion is without significant trend changes. As seen in Fig. 2, the FFR conversion varies in order: Pt–Ni/MWNT (95.9%)>Pt–Fe/MWNT (95.2%)>Pt/MWNT (64.5%) at 100°C. Pt–Fe/MWNT possessed the highest selectivity (91.8%) towards FFA. However, selectivity of FFA decreases to 76.2%, as temperature increases to 130°C. In the case of Pd-based catalysts, Pd/MWNT has better hydrogenation activity compared to Pt/MWNT. It can be explained that both Pd/MWNT and Pt/MWNT are in high dispersion, and with the same actual metal content (0.47wt%), Pd/MWNT possesses more active molecules. As reaction temperature rises from 25 to 130°C, FFR conversion and selectivity of THFA increase significantly. FFR conversion varies in order: Pd–Ni/MWNT (96.7%)>Pd–Fe/MWNT (90.4%)>Pd/MWNT (85.1%), while THFA selectivity would gradually descend in order: Pd–Ni/MWNT (86.1%)>Pd/MWNT (75.1%)>Pd–Fe/MWNT (68.7%) at 130°C. It is worth noting that adding Fe and Ni to Pt-based and Pd-based catalysts as the promoters makes a difference. Metallic nickel is beneficial for both CC and CO hydrogenation, while metallic iron facilitates CO hydrogenation."
9,Influence of reaction time,"3.3 Influence of reaction time Fig. 3 presents the process of reaction as a function of time over Pt-based and Pd-based catalysts at 100°C and 30bar hydrogen. For Pt-based catalysts, selectivity towards FFA has been taken into account in contrast to the formation of THFA over Pd-based catalysts. Similar trend for conversion of FFR has been observed over Pt- and Pd-based catalysts. Most of furfural molecules have been converted in less than an hour over Pt-based bimetallic and Pd-based catalysts. Pt–Fe/MWNT, Pt–Ni/MWNT, and Pd–Ni/MWNT catalysts are highly active hydrogenation catalysts. After the reaction runs for 1h, over 85.5% conversion of FFR is achieved over these catalysts with the hydrogenation products FFA (67.9%, over Pt–Fe/MWNT), FFA (65.2%, over Pt–Ni/MWNT), and THFA (75.5%, over Pd–Ni/MWNT). FFR conversion increases slightly with reaction time prolonged to 10h, and it decreases in order: Pd–Ni/MWNT (97.3%)>Pt–Ni/MWNT (96.5%)>Pt–Fe/MWNT (96.3%)>Pd–Fe/MWNT (93.3%)>Pd/MWNT (92.3%)>Pt/MWNT (76.3%). However, formation of FFA and THFA varies as reaction time prolonged using different catalysts. For Pt–Fe/MWNT and Pt–Ni/MWNT catalysts, selectivity of FFA decreases from 91.8% and 84.1% to 76.2% and 72.8%, respectively after relatively long reaction time (10h). On the contrary, selectivity of THFA increases to 67.5% and 85.2% over Pd–Fe/MWNT and Pd–Ni/MWNT catalysts, respectively after 10h reaction time."
10,Influence of support,"3.4 Influence of support Alloyed Pt–Fe, Pt–Ni and Pd–Ni were introduced on MWNT, AC, H-AC, MgO, γ-Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 support for the catalytic hydrogenation of FFR at 100°C and 30bar H2 for 5h in presence of an ethanol solvent (summarized in Table 2 ). MWNT support gives the most excellent catalytic activity compared to other supports. Byproducts FDA could be formed in large quantity over AC, H-AC, MgO, γ-Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 supports. Although there has a difference about the conversion of FFR over bimetallic Pt-Fe, Pt-Ni and Pd-Ni catalysts with various supports, metallic iron facilitates CO hydrogenation as we suggested. It should also be noted that the conversion of FFR is even lower using H-AC as a support than metal supported over AC, which is in accordance with our group early research [28]. Oxygenates functional groups have been increased significantly on the surface of activated carbon after modification at the cost of collapsion of parts of activated carbon pores, especially the micropores (seen in Table S3). These pores might offer more contact points with active compounds, which is supposed to improve the catalytic performance. Moreover, it is interesting to be found that the byproducts (FDA and others) selectivity decreases while the desired products selectivity increases after activated carbon support with acid treatment. It shows the acid sites of AC have an impact on furfural selective conversion. As mentioned by Robert Baker and An et al. [36,37], the reaction pathway would be greatly affected by the synergic effects from Pt surface and support acid sites. Accordingly, the acid sites of different supports were measured by NH3-TPD in Fig. 4 . For metal oxide supports, γ-Al2O3 support presents three NH3 desorption peaks in the temperature range of 50–700°C. The first peak (100–300°C) should be assigned to weak acid sites. The second peak (300–500°C) and the third peak (500–700°C) correspond to moderate and strong acid sites, respectively. While ZrO2 and TiO2 support demonstrate a wide peak of 100–500°C, indicating the presence of some amount of weak and moderate acid sites. These acid sites are not obvious over MgO support because of its strong basicity. The selectivity of byproducts (FDA and others) over selected metal oxide supports roughly shows the following sequence: MgO>ZrO2 >TiO2 >γ-Al2O3. The trend is opposite to the order of support acid sites. It seems that the byproducts (FDA and others) are more favorable to occur over support with low amount of acid sites within the metal oxide supports screened. For AC and modified MWNT support, it has been identified that activated carbon and modified MWNT support will release CO2, CO and water due to surface functional groups decomposing at different temperatures in the TPD experiment [38,39]. The stronger acid groups on the surface of nitric acid treatment MWNT lead to CO2-desorption at low temperatures (between 200 and 500°C) and the weaker acid sites (lactone, phenol, and carbonyl groups) lead to CO-desorption at higher temperatures (over 500°C) [40,41]. Fig. 4 shows most of the strong acid ones (carboxylic and anhydride groups) on modified MWNT have been removed before NH3-TPD test by pretreatment at 500°C, due to the relatively flat curve of NH3-TPD profile of MWNT at 200–500°C. The peak (about 570°C for TPD profile of MWNT and 590°C for NH3-TPD profile of MWNT) might be the decomposition of a small amount of impurities in MWNT. The CO-desorption has also been observed over both AC and MWNT support at 500–700°C. On the one hand, the obvious superiority observed over modified MWNT for catalyzing FFR hydrogenation should be explained by the unique structure of MWNT [42], resulting in high effective surface area and dispersion in the liquid medium compared to the other metal oxide supports. On the other hand, the acid sites enhanced by nitric acid treatment in the modified MWNT could activate the furfuryl-oxy intermediate formation and furfuryl-oxy intermediate might provide a vital role in the formation of FFA and THFA as an active adsorbate."
11,Texture/structure properties of catalyst,"3.5 Texture/structure properties of catalyst The SBET of MWNT increased to 127m2/g with pretreatment by nitric acid (Table 1). It should be attributed to the removal of some metallic impurities and amorphous carbon on the MWNT surface using nitric acid treatment [20]. The BET surface area decreased slightly after Pt/Pd and transition metal introduced to the treated MWNT. The XRD patterns of Pt and Pd catalysts with transition metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) added are shown in Fig. S4. Characteristic diffraction peak (0 0 2) of a graphite-like tube-wall of the MWNT is situated at 26.5° [43]. No obvious diffraction peaks of cubic structure of metallic Pt or Pd appeared. It can be due to the low Pt and Pd contents (0.5wt%), and also the small particle size and high dispersion of Pt and Pd. H2-TPR has been carried out to observe the difference of adding a second metal to prepared catalysts in the reducibility and interaction between active species and MWNT support. As reported by Mierczynski et al. [44], the MWNT could not be reduced from 25°C to 900°C. As shown in Fig. 5 , there was a wide peak of all the catalysts at 400–650°C, corresponding to the carbon nanotubes gasification process to form CH4. Methane formation generally occurs in the temperature range of 390–800°C [45–47]. From TPR profiles of Pt-based catalysts, it can be seen that the Pt/MWNT catalyst presents two reduction peaks situated at 122 and 208°C, respectively (Fig. 5a). The first peak could be due to the weak interaction between PtO and MWNT support, the second is probably related to PtO with high dispersion and a strong interaction between PtO and MWNT. While reduction peaks occur at higher temperature of Pt–Fe/MWNT and Pt–Ni/MWNT, which could be due to the alloying of Pt–Fe and Pt–Ni metal (confirmed by HR-TEM). The total H2 consumption values of Pt-based catalysts decrease in the order: Pt–Fe/MWNT (24.72μmol/g)>Pt–Ni/MWNT (21.71μmol/g)>Pt/MWNT (15.98μmol/g) (Table 3 ). As found in literature, some reports pointed out that bulk PdO could be reduced by hydrogen at around 25°C, and the formed β-PdH would exhibit a negative peak at about 60–100°C concerned with the β-PdH decomposition [21,48]. However, this result was not observed within the temperature range. Pd-based catalysts have lower hydrogen uptake values and larger H2 consumption values than Pt-based catalysts. The total H2 consumption values of Pd-based catalysts decrease in the order: Pd–Ni/MWNT (33.48μmol/g)>Pd–Fe/MWNT (31.48μmol/g)>Pd/MWNT (27.73μmol/g). It is interesting that different behavior of both Pt- and Pd-based catalysts in H2-TPR measurement is in accord with the particle size of metal which was counted from TEM image (Table 1 and Fig. 7 ). The smaller metal size has the larger hydrogen consumption. In terms of the H2 consumption value of Pd-based catalysts being higher than the Pt-based catalysts, this should be due to the more absolute moles of Pd-based catalysts since the metal loading has little difference. Another possible reason is that the strength of the interaction of PdO with MWNT and PtO with MWNT support exits difference. XPS spectra of Pt and Pd supported on MWNT indicate that the noble metals were both in zero and +2 valence state (Fig. 6 ). Though these reduced catalysts were stored in quartz tube with Ar, it was still unable for all the samples to avoid contact with the air in XPS measurement. As a result, this XPS data cannot reflect the actual state of the catalyst in reaction process, but to some extent, it provides circumstantial evidence for redox properties of the supported metal and the oxidized/deactivated species formation [21]. Surface composition of samples suggests that metal loading amount on MWNT surface is very low (Table 3), which is in agreement with ICP results. As proposed by Croy and Domok et al. [49,50], the binding energy (BE) values of photoelectrons were deeply influenced by the size of the metal particles. In general, higher binding energy would be found on the smaller metal particle. Compared to 5wt% loading amount of Pt supported on MWNT in literature (Pt 4f7/2, 71.24eV) [30], BE values of 0.5wt% Pt/MWNT are higher, which can be ascribed to the smaller particle size (2.0–2.6nm) of Pt nano particles. As shown in Fig. 6a, BE values of platinum for Pt–Fe/MWNT are lower than Pt/MWNT catalyst. It should be assigned to the electrons transferring from iron to platinum because of the Pt–Fe alloy. Due to the low metal loading amount, XPS spectrum of iron is not obvious (Fig. 6b). The Fe 2p spectrum of Pt–Fe/MWNT indicates that almost all of the iron is in the oxidation state, which is confirmed by the peak at 708.20eV. The 2p3/2 binding energy of alloying iron is higher than that corresponding to metallic iron (706.8eV) [51,52], which might be attributed to the electron donating by alloy iron or the electron transfer from iron to MWNT support. For Pd supported on MWNT (Fig. 6c), same BE values variation have been observed. BE values of palladium for Pd–Ni/MWNT are lower than Pd/MWNT catalyst, which is attributed to the electrons transferring from nickel to palladium owing to the Pd–Ni alloy. From the Ni 2p spectra of Pd–Ni/MWNT (Fig. 6d), the main peak situated at around 854.91eV corresponds to nickel oxide species."
12,Morphologies of catalyst,"3.6 Morphologies of catalyst Structure of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts was observed by TEM technique and pictures are presented in Fig. 7, and particle sizes of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. As shown in the pictures, a large proportion of metallic particles are in uniform dispersion on the MWNT external surface. With respect to Pt-based catalysts, averaged particle size of Pt crystallites decreases from 2.6 to 2.0 and 2.4nm, when Fe and Ni were used as promoters, respectively. In the case of Pd-based catalysts, averaged crystallite size decreases from 2.4 to 2.3 and 2.2nm when Fe and Ni were used. This result indicated that the noble metal particles were indeed with high dispersion on the nanoscale. Because of the low loading amount of metal on MWNT, detailed information about the alloy of noble metals and promoters could not be acquired by XRD technique. Therefore, Pt/MWNT, Pd/MWNT, Pt–Fe/MWNT and Pd–Ni/MWNT were characterized by HR-TEM. The HR-TEM image of the Pt/MWNT shows the face-centered cubic (100), while Pt–Fe/MWNT shows the dominant formation of the face-centered cubic (111) lattice image (Fig. 8 a, b). The lattice spacing is observed to be 0.203nm for Pt (111) of Pt–Fe/MWNT (Fig. 8b), while this value is slightly smaller than that of the (111) plane of Pt (0.225 nm) due to the contraction of the lattice upon substitution of a Pt atom with a Fe atom. Hu et al. [53] observed this phenomenon when Ni was doped with Pt to form the Pt–Ni alloy. Same result is also obtained from Pd/MWNT and Pd–Ni/MWNT (shown in Fig. S5). The compositions of Pt–Fe/MWNT catalyst were estimated by EDS as shown in Fig. 8c. The EDS result for the Pt-Ni catalysts reveals the presence of C, Pt, and Fe, and the background signal of some amount of Cu and Si, suggesting that the nano catalysts supported on the MWNT are Pt–Fe nano particles. The atomic ratio (Table S4) between Pt and Fe of the prepared catalyst is close to that of the XPS elemental composition in Table 3. As evidenced by the elemental mapping, Pt and Fe are remarkably uniform and well dispersed on the MWNT surface (Fig. 8d). All of the nano particles are considered to be spherical with a mean particle diameter of approximately 2.0 nm, as evaluated by TEM analysis (Fig. 7b)."
13,Recyclability of catalysts,"3.7 Recyclability of catalysts The recyclability of Pt–Fe/MWNT and Pd–Ni/MWNT in hydrogenation of FFR was investigated at 100°C, 30bar hydrogen and 1h reaction time. Results were in comparison with Pt/MWNT and Pd/MWNT. Bimetallic catalysts show stable activity and selectivity even after 5 cycles (Fig. 9 c, left panel for Pt–Fe/MWNT; Fig. 9d, right panel for Pd–Ni/MWNT). However, there is an evident loss both in catalytic activity and FFA/THFA selectivity for monometallic Pt/MWNT and Pd/MWNT catalysts (Fig. 9a and b). Hence, this result indicates that the catalysts become more recyclable and the loss of active species could be reduced after promoters were introduced to form an alloy."
14,Selective hydrogenation over Pt based and Pd based bimetallic catalysts,"3.8 Selective hydrogenation over Pt based and Pd based bimetallic catalysts Based on the experimental data acquired, Pt-Fe/MWNT catalyst is selective for hydrogenation of CO to form FFA while Pd-Ni/MWNT catalyst is beneficial for both CC and CO group forming THFA. As proposed in previous literature, furfural can be adsorbed and activated through either η1-(O)-aldehyde or η2-(CO)-aldehyde mode of coordination [54]. Delbecq et al. further suggested that the adsorption of CC and CO of unsaturated aldehydes varies on different face of Pt and Pd [55]. Here, following main factors were taken into account to explain the different result of furfural hydrogenation over Pt-Fe/MWNT and Pd-Ni/MWNT. Firstly, the Pt bulk has a slightly lower Fermi level and larger d-band width than Pd, which leads to strengthening interactions between molecule and Pt surface, especially the stronger four electron repulsive interactions whose dominant role favors CO hydrogenation over Pt between p-electrons of furan ring and Pt d-electrons [55,56]. Thus, high yield of THFA could be obtained over Pd due to the closer interaction with furan ring p-electrons. Secondly, Pt (111) plane prefers adsorption of the molecule through η1(CO) coordination, while adsorption on Pt (100) occurs through both η2(CC) and η1(CO) modes, and Pd (111) would behave like the Pt (100) [21,55]. When using transition metal (Fe, Ni) as promoters, more active crystal planes Pt (111) (Fig. 8a, b) and Pd (111) (Fig. S5a, b) might be exposed, and hence, FFA or THFA is formed selectively over bimetallic catalysts. This difference in product selectivity over Pt based and Pd based catalysts is also attributed to the differences in the binding energies and orientation of adsorption of FFR on catalyst surfaces [54,57]."
15,Conclusions,"In summary, we demonstrated a series of MWNT supported low loading amount of Pt-based and Pd-based bimetallic catalysts with a highly uniform size prepared by a simple co-impregnation method. The bimetallic synergistic effect in Pt–Fe/MWNT and Pd–Ni/MWNT catalysts was used to enhance the catalytic activity for furfural hydrogenation in liquid phase. Additionally various effects including support, promoter and reaction conditions mainly about temperature and reaction time were fully investigated. Catalysts have shown stable activity and selectivity after 5 cycles using Pt–Fe/MWNT and Pd–Ni/MWNT catalysts. This work may also provide some references for the upgrading of other components in bio-oil."
