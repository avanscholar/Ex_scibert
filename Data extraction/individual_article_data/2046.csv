0,Introduction,"Over the past century, human activities have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere thus contributing to the increase of earth’s surface temperature beyond its historical average values, with potentially harmful effects on ecosystems, biodiversity and the livelihoods of people worldwide. Since most greenhouse gases come from burning fossil fuels to produce energy, a transition towards a renewable, efficient and sustainable energy model based in the use of renewable energy is being adopted as a suitable strategy to mitigate the global warming impacts. In this sense, biomass-derived fuels have emerged as a suitable step and many countries have introduced advanced policies to support their production [1]. Biodiesel is one of the most popular biofuels and it is forecasted that it could make up a large fraction of all transportation fuels in the near future [2,3]. This biofuel presents some advantages compared to fossil fuels, such as its biodegradability, less carbon monoxide, particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions. However, biodiesel is not competitive in terms of price yet [4]. At present, biodiesel is commonly produced by transesterification of vegetable oils (canola, sunflower, palm, etc) or animal fat, with alcohol, usually methanol, in the presence of an alkali or acid homogeneous catalyst [5]. The products, fatty acid methylesters (FAMEs), are called biodiesel and include glycerol as a by-product. The transesterification reaction produces biodiesel and glycerol at a volumetric ratio of 10:1. This glycerol known as crude glycerol (CG) contains impurities such as methanol, water, inorganic salts, free fatty acids, mono-, di- and triacylglycerols and biodiesel making it a low value product. Because of that and also of the increasing worldwide biodiesel production this low-grade CG has become a signiﬁcant problem concerning its ﬁnal disposal. At present, CG is mainly incinerated to generate heat and electricity. This practice leads to the generation of greenhouse gases and an underutilization of the resource [6]. One way of lowering the production cost of biodiesel would be to use CG to produce a hydrogen-rich gas mixture via steam reforming, partial oxidation, autothermal or aqueous reforming techniques [7]. Steam reforming is the most widely used process to obtain hydrogen-rich mixtures from natural gas. This alternative is promising for the use of glycerol, since the processing of glycerol by catalytic reforming requires few changes in the industrial processes [7]. The addition of oxygen to steam reforming reaction converts the process into oxidative steam reforming of glycerol that could be an autothermic reaction. This oxygen decreases the risk of carbon deposition on the surface of the catalyst or acts to oxidize the already deposited carbon, regenerating the catalyst, thus maintaining the activity of the catalyst for a longer time [8]. Thermodynamic studies performed with pure glycerol showed that the most suitable conditions for H2 production are attained at temperatures between 627–727 °C, water to glycerol ratios of 9 to 12 and oxygen to glycerol ratios of 0–0.4 [9]. However, very few studies have been conducted using CG in the feed probably because the catalyst is rapidly deactivated by the impurities contained in the CG. Slinn et al. [10] studied steam reforming of CG using Pt/Al2O3 over a range of conditions. A comparison between crude and pure glycerol was established. It was found that CG conversions were lower than those obtained with pure glycerol. They reported that long chain fatty acid impurities were harder to reform and more amount of carbon is deposited onto the catalyst surface. Dou et al. [11] investigated pure and CG steam reforming over a commercial Ni-based catalyst with and without in situ CO2 removal by carbonation of calcined dolomite. The results indicated that steam reforming of CG with in situ CO2 removal is shown to be an effective means of achieving hydrogen purity close to 90% in pre-CO2 breakthrough conditions. Fermoso et al. [12] also studied CG steam reforming with in situ CO2 removal (sorption enhanced steam reforming) but over Ni-Co catalyst derived from hydrotalcite-like material and calcined dolomite as CO2 sorbent. This process occurred until the calcined dolomite was saturated (140 min). They concluded that the main challenges in CG steam reforming were carbon formation due to the presence of non-volatile heavy compounds and accumulation of alkaline salts due to the presence of transesterification catalysts in the CG. However, the effects of inorganic salts on long-term experiments was not investigated. Remón et al. [13] investigated the effect of acetic acid, methanol and potassium hydroxide on the catalytic steam reforming of glycerol. The results indicated that the impurities mentioned above strongly affect carbon conversion to gas and solid but the composition of the gas was barely affected by the presence of its. Remón et al. [14] also presented a two-step process for CG valorisation for hydrogen production using Ni-based catalysts in a fluidised bed reactor. The CG was first neutralised with acetic acid followed by a vacuum distillation to produce the refined glycerol, and then went through a catalytic steam reforming process. They found optimum conditions using a final pH of 6 in the neutralisation step, a temperature of 680 °C and a glycerol concentration of 37 wt.% in the refined glycerol solution. In a previous work we reported that activated carbon supported nickel catalysts were active in CG steam reforming at 650 °C. Promotion with different metal oxides (MgO, La2O3, Y2O3) was effective to increase H2 yield which attains more than 80% of the maximum theoretical amount with MgO [15]. In another work of our group [16], Ni-La-Ti coprecipitated catalysts were evaluated in GC steam reforming at 500 °C and 650 °C. Carbon conversion to gas at 500 °C were ˜35% revealing a low decomposition of the different reaction intermediates through reactions with rupture of CC bonds. At 650 °C conversion increased significantly (˜92.0%), which suggests that, in addition to the most reactive components (methanol and glycerol), fatty acids could also react under these reaction conditions leading to typical gaseous products. The above results show that there is a still great challenge to produce almost pure hydrogen directly from CG due to the complexity of its composition. Nickel is the most investigated metal in glycerol steam reforming because of its capacity to facilitate C-C rupture and its low cost compared to other metals also used for these purposes (Pt, Ru, Rh) [17–19]. The nature of the support plays an important role towards catalyst properties including its deactivation behavior. α-Al2O3 is the most commonly used due to its high specific surface area and its mechanical and chemical resistance under reaction conditions. However, it is also known that carbon deposition and catalyst sintering, both factor leading to catalyst deactivation are also promoted when alumina is used as support [19,20]. Other metal oxides are also used either as supports or promoters in order to improve the catalytic performance. ZrO2 and CeO2 are among the most investigated because of their capacity to increase resistance to carbon deposition and structural stability [21–29]. Favorable redox properties and oxygen mobility characteristics of these oxides allows them to supply oxygen to the active site and minimize carbon deposition and metal sintering. Addition of several lanthanide and alkaline-earth metal cations such as Y3+, La3+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ into these oxides also enhance the catalytic activity and resistance towards carbon deposition, which is ascribed to the improvement of structural stability and strong interactions with Ni [22,30,31]. In the case of La, MeO2–La2O3 solid solutions (Me: Zr or Ce) with a crystalline structure typical of pyrochlore compounds are formed [32–34], while Ni is found as a NiO separate phase. Reduction of NiO to Ni is almost complete under operation conditions and strong interactions between both phases help to keep low Ni crystallite size and to avoid carbon accumulation. In this work, mixed oxides of general formula Ni (wt. 12%)-La2(Zr1-xCex)2 were taken as precursors of Ni catalysts for an experimental investigation of steam and oxidative steam reforming of CG without any purification pretreatment. Zirconium substitution by cerium cations (x = 0.5) was evaluated in order to observe changes in catalytic activity and resistance to deactivation aiming at contributing to the scarce discussion of carbon formation when processing CG to generate green hydrogen."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The materials used in this work were: zirconium n-propoxide [Zr(OCH2CH2CH3)4], 70% in 1-propanol (Aldrich, 97% purity), nickel, lanthanum and cerium nitrates [Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, La(NO3)3.6H2O, Ce(NO3)3.6H2O] (Aldrich, 99% purity), citric acid monohydrate (Merck, 99.5 purity) and ethylene glycol (Carlo Erba, 99.5% purity)."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation The synthesis was carried out by the Pechini-type polymerized complex route [35]. This technique allows preparing homogeneous complex oxides with perovskite, pyrochlore and fluorite structure having well controlled properties and it was used for several authors to synthesize steam reforming catalysts [36]. Three catalysts were prepared with the following metals atomic ratio: La:Ce = 1:1, La:Zr = 1:1 and La:Ce:Zr = 1:0.5:0.5. Ni content was 12 wt. % in all cases. The amount of nickel was selected according to other works that use Ni-based catalysts for glycerol steam reforming [4]. First, stoichiometric amounts of metal precursors were dissolved in ethylene glycol and then anhydrous citric acid (CA) was added to this solution. It was used a molar ratio of metal:CA of 1:3 and EG:CA of 4:1. The solution was stirred and heated to 70 °C for 1 h until it became translucent. After that, the temperature was increased to 130 °C to promote the polyesterification reaction between the citric acid and ethylene glycol. After several hours a transparent brown glassy resin was obtained which was then transferred to a muffle furnace at 350 °C for 2 h. The resulting black solid mass was carefully ground into a powder and subsequently calcined at 850 °C for 4 h. This calcination temperature was chosen to guarantee the formation of the biphasic system NiO/mixed oxide [37]. The three prepared catalysts will be denoted as NiLaCe, NiLaCeZr and NiLaZr for its identification in the rest of this work."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Nitrogen physisorption measurements were conducted on a Beckman Coulter surface area analyzer (Coulter SA model 3100). The catalyst was degassed at 100 °C for 10 h prior to N2 adsorption–desorption measurements. The specific surface area was calculated from the BET model and the total pore volume was estimated at a relative pressure of 0.98. The crystalline phases of fresh and reduced catalysts were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with CuK α radiation in the 2θ = 10–80° range using 2θ steps of 0.02° with a 5 s integration time per step. Ni and NiO crystallite size were estimated by the Scherrer equation [29]. The reducibility of the catalyst was studied by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) using 5% H2/Ar at a flow rate of 60 cm3 min−1. Standard reduction was conducted at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 25 to 850 °C A mass spectrometer in a Baltzers Omnistar unit monitored the hydrogen consumption. Ni content in the catalysts were obtained by atomic emission spectroscopy coupled to an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP-OES) equipment Perkin-Elmer Optima 2100. Ni dispersion was determined by H2 chemisorption in a volumetric equipment at 25 °C, using the double isotherm method assuming an adsorption stoichiometry of 1:1 as described in [30]. The catalyst sample was previously reduced in a pure H2 flow at 650 °C and subsequently evacuated at the same temperature. Basicity measurements were performed by temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (TPD-CO2) preadsorbed at room temperature. Reduced catalysts were exposed to a flowing mixture of 3% of CO2 in N2 (60 mL min−1) until surface saturation. Then, weakly adsorbed CO2 was removed by flushing with N2. Finally, the temperature was increased to 800 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. The desorbed CO2 was converted into CH4 on a Ni/Kieselghur catalyst held at 400 °C and then analyzed in a flame ionization detector (FID). Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the spent catalysts was carried out using a similar apparatus by introducing a gas flow (60 mL min−1) containing a mixture of O2:N2 (2:98) and the temperature was increased up to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Carbon build-up on the spent catalysts was analysed for its C and H contents (Thermo Scientific Flash 2000). EDS microanalysis of the tested catalysts were studied using scanning electron microscopy (Jeol JSM-5900 LV)."
5,Crude glycerol,"2.4 Crude glycerol The CG used in the present work mainly consists of 64 wt% glycerol, inorganic salts 5.7 wt%, methanol and water lower than 5 wt% and fatty acids either free or as methyl esters up to 26 wt%, provided by ALUR (Alcoholes del Uruguay). Potassium methylate was used as transesterification catalyst. CG composition was determined by elemental analysis (Thermo Scientific Flash 2000) and it is recently reported elsewhere [15]. The calculated average elemental molar formula for CG determined from these results was C3.5H9.0O3.1 and subsequently used to calculate conversion and yield parameters."
6,Catalytic tests,"2.5 Catalytic tests Crude glycerol steam reforming (CGSR) and oxidative steam reforming (CGOSR) tests were carried out in a 1.2 cm diameter and 30 cm length stainless steel tubular fixed bed reactor located inside a tubular electric furnace. The catalyst bed configuration consists in a 2 g SiC (30–40 mesh) bed placed above 0.2 g (120–170 mesh) of the catalyst. Before reaction, the catalyst was reduced under a 30 mL min−1 pure hydrogen flow by heating from room temperature to 650 °C, at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and keeping the final temperature for 1 h. The reduction temperature was chosen as the minimum in which the three catalysts are completely reduced. This was verified by performing a TPR of the reduced catalyst and verifying that the consumption of hydrogen corresponds only to the support. Following reduction, the H2 flow was stopped and the reactor purged with argon. Then the reactor was brought to the reaction temperature under argon. After that, the water:CG solution (30 wt% of CG) was fed at 2.0 mL h−1 with a peristaltic pump (Cole Parmer 74900 Series) through a device consisting of two concentric tubes which are placed into the tubular reactor. Water:CG solution was injected into the internal tube (0.2 mm i.d.) and argon through the external one (2.1 mm i.d.). With this device, partial vaporization of glycerol and other compounds in the CG would occur in the sprayed liquid solution along with water. Proper adjustment of the distance of the device to the catalytic bed allowed to obtain a stable feed of the solution. Oxygen was fed through a separate gas line with an O2 to CG molar ratio of 0.5. The experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure with time-on-stream (TOS) of 6 h and reaction temperature of 650 °C. Reaction temperature was chosen from a previous work in which pure glycerol was completely converted [34]. The steam-to-carbon (S/C) molar ratio was equal to 3.7. Under these conditions the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 20 L h−1 g−1 and WHSVCG defined as the ratio between the mass flow rate of crude glycerol fed and the mass of catalyst was 3 h−1. Unreacted glycerol and some of the condensable reaction products were retained in a dry ice trap at the reactor exit. Three reaction cycles of 20 h making intermediates steps of regeneration were performed with the NiLaCeZr catalyst under GHSV = 35 L h−1 g−1 and WHSVCG = 10 h−1 conditions. After the first cycle, regeneration was carried out at 650 °C for 1 h under 50% O2/Ar atmosphere (20 mL min−1). After the second cycle the catalyst was regenerated by treatment with oxygen and then washed with distilled water to remove the salts deposited on it. Non-condensable products, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2 (ethane and ethylene) and C3 (propane and propylene) hydrocarbons, were periodically analyzed with a gas-chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14B) equipped with FID and TCD detectors in series and columns Supelco CarboxenTM-1000 and Porapak Q. At the end of reaction, glycerol and condensed liquid products were collected and analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu Prominence) equipped with a Rezex RHM-Monosaccharide H+ (8%) column and a refractive index detector. Catalytic performance was evaluated in terms of glycerol conversion, carbon conversion to non-condensable products (XC,GAS), carbon conversion to liquid products (XC,LIQ), hydrogen yield (H2 yield) and product distribution (in dry basis) according to: (1) X G l y ( % ) = 100 * G l y i n - G l y o u t G l y i n (2) X C , G A S ( % ) = 100 * ∑ F C , i * n i F C , I N (3) X C , L I Q ( % ) = 100 * C l i q . p r o d u c t s ( g ) C F E D ( g ) (4) H 2 Y i e l d ( % ) = 100 * F H 2 N T E R M O * F C G (5) Y i = 100 * F C , i o r F H 2 ∑ F C , i + F H 2 d r y b a s i s where FC,i is the molar flow of product i (i = CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8); ni the number of carbon atoms in product i; FC,IN is the molar flow of carbon atoms in the CG-water solution fed to the reactor and calculated over the 94.3% of the total weighted amount of CG used for its preparation (5.7% corresponds to the ash fraction determined by calcination); Cliq, products is the total mass of carbon in products retained in the liquid aqueous solution in the dry ice trap (excluding glycerol); CFED is the total mass of carbon in the CG-water solution fed during the test; FH2 is the molar flow rate of H2 (mol min−1); FCG is the molar flow rate of CG (mol min−1) and NTERMO is the thermodynamic equilibrium value of H2 calculated by Fact-Web software [38] on the basis of Gibbs energy minimization, being 7.43 for CGSR and 6.55 for CGOSR. Preliminary runs were carried out to determine the proper catalyst particle size and reactant flow to avoid internal and external diffusion limitations, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,"The crystalline phases of fresh and reduced Ni-La-Me catalysts were identified determined by XRD. Diffractograms of the three calcined catalysts presented in Fig. 1 a showed peaks at 2θ = 37.3°, 43.3° and 62.9° assigned to (111), (200), and (220) planes of cubic NiO phase. For NiLaCe catalyst peaks are corresponded to the pure La2Ce2O7 phase in agreement with the literature [39]. NiLaZr catalyst peaks attributed to La2Zr2O7 pyrochlore phase. The XRD pattern of the NiLaCeZr catalyst showed diffraction peaks shifted to higher and lower 2θ angles for La2Ce2O7 and La2Zr2O7 respectively in concordance with the lower ionic radii of Zr4+ (0.84 Å) with respect to the ionic radii of Ce4+ (0.97 Å) [34] indicating that Ce4+ and Zr4+ are replaced by each other [39]. Similar XRD patterns were observed over the reduced catalysts (Fig. 1b) in which the peaks corresponding to NiO disappears completely and peaks assigned to metallic nickel at 2θ = 44.5° and 51.8° corresponding to (111) and (200) planes appears, reflecting that nickel oxide was successfully reduced to metallic nickel. No diffraction peaks corresponding to La2O3, CeO2 and ZrO2 were detected in either the calcined or the reduced catalysts. The BET surface areas of the fresh catalysts were measured by N2 physisorption, the results of which are presented in Table 1 . Low BET areas were found for the 3 catalysts and are similar to those already reported in previous works for others trimetallic mixed oxide systems prepared by a coprecipitation technique [16,34]. Beyond the precedent comments, the BET area of NiLaCeZr practically doubles those of the two other catalysts. This catalyst also has the highest pore volume (0.075 cm3 g−1) while NiLaZr has the smallest one. Differences between average pore diameters can also be observed with the highest value corresponding to NiLaCe (32.6 nm) and the smallest one to NiLaZr (21.5 nm). High calcination temperature (850 °C) used in the final thermal treatment probably leads to sintering of this type of solids, resulting in a large grain size with lower surface area. Table 1 also shows that Ni content are close to the theoretical value (12%). NiO particle size calculated by Scherrer´s equation was almost the same for the three prepared catalysts Ni particle size was calculated from the Scherrer equation and by H2 chemisorption measurements and the results are summarized in Table 2 . The Scherrer equation provides very similar values (18–20 nm) while H2 chemisorption provides quite different values. This last technique is pointed as the most suitable one since results are based on surface averaged particle size, while Scherrer equation provides results based on a volumetric basis [40]. NiLaZr has the smallest value with both calculation methods (DNi = 18 nm and 41 nm respectively), while NiLaCe has the highest one (20 and 112 nm). Based in results obtained by H2 chemisorption a marked decrease is observed for the two Zr-containing catalysts with regards to the Zr-free one and that can be related to some properties of ZrO2 materials. Indeed, it is well-known that ZrO2 prevents Ni particles from sintering during the SR reactions at high temperatures [28,41]. This property can be related to its low thermal conductivity which allows it to be commonly used in thermal barrier coating materials [42]. The presence of ZrO2 could thus depress thermal diffusion of different metal atoms in the bulk material thus slowing down Ni sintering. On the other hand, zirconia is reported to be very effective to increase the oxygen mobility in ceria materials and increase the process of vacancy formation, thus contributing to stabilize the active phase and inhibit sintering [43,44]. TPR analysis are shown in Fig. 2 . Origin software was used for the deconvolution of these TPR profiles. Green lines represent the experimental spectra. Several H2 consumption steps are observed and correspond to the reduction of NiO particles of different size and/or different interaction degree with the mixed oxide. NiLaZr and NiLaCeZr catalysts show a first step from 270 °C to 350 °C which is attributed to the reduction of bulk NiO without interaction with the mixed oxide [42]. Deconvolution into Gaussian peaks allows to better characterize the contribution of the different Ni species. Table 3 summarizes the relative contribution of deconvoluted signals. NiLaCe and NiLaCeZr show a deconvoluted peak centered on a temperature close to 400 °C that does not appear in NiLaZr and suggests that Ni reducibility is promoted by Ce as reported in the literature [45]. Peaks centered on temperatures higher than 500 °C appears only in NiLaZr (514 °C, 613 °C and 646 °C) and NiLaCeZr (521 °C and 632 °C) which suggests that they correspond to the reduction of Ni species having strong interactions with Zr. Differences between the influence of Ce and Zr on Ni reducibility can be related to their physical and chemical properties. CeO2 is known to form nonstoichiometric oxides (CeO(2-x)) at low oxygen partial pressures and temperatures above 773 K. Oxygen vacancies and high-ionic mobility exist in these compounds which gives them an enhanced redox ability [46]. Table 3 also shows that the reducibility of the 3 catalysts is higher than 100% corresponding to the whole amount of Ni. Theoretical uptake of H2 for total reduction, assuming that NiO is stoichiometrically reduced to Ni, is 1.99 mmol gcat −1. NiLaCe and NiLaCeZr have the highest values (132% and 131% respectively) which can be ascribed to partial reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3. In the case of NiLaZr (116%), exceeding H2 consumption could be ascribed to oxygen removal from mixed metal oxide accompanying the creation of oxygen defects mainly under the most severe reducing conditions at the range of highest temperatures [47]. Catalyst basicity was characterized by TPD-CO2 since it has been reported that it limits the deposition of carbon and enhance the catalyst stability [48]. Fig. 3 shows that all 3 reduced catalysts present the most pronounced desorption peaks in the temperature range of medium basic strength between 150 °C and 450 °C. Additional signals are observed in the region of higher strength between 500 °C and 700 °C. According to CO2 uptakes shown in Table 4 NiLaCe has the smallest number of basic sites. NiLaCeZr has the greatest amount of basic adsorption sites both in medium and high strength regions. It has been reported that replacement of cerium ions by zirconium increases the oxygen mobility and the process of oxygen vacancies formation [28]. An increase in oxygen mobility can, in turn, increase the surface concentration of basic sites measured by CO2 chemisorption [49]. A similar behavior derived from partial replacement of Ce by Zr could also take place in presence of La in the pyrochlore structures (A2B2O7) here studied, leading to the increase of different basic sites [30]. NiLaCeZr has also the highest surface specific area, which in turn can also contribute to increase the amount of basic adsorption sites. Table 5 summarizes the results obtained in CGSR and CGOSR tests at 650 °C. Glycerol conversion calculated from HPLC analysis of the liquid effluent, is almost complete for both kind of tests. Qualitative analyses of the liquid effluent in both reforming experiments revealed the presence of different intermediates such as acetaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, acetone, acetic acid, ethane-1,2-diol, propane-1,2-diol in agreement with those reported in the literature for glycerol steam reforming experiments [50]. Carbon conversion to gas products is about 74% in CGSR tests. This value is quite lower than those reported in a previous work of our group (90%), working with pure glycerol and other Ni-based catalysts under the same steam reforming conditions (atmospheric pressure, T = 650 °C, GHSV = 20 L h−1 g−1 and WHSVCG = 3 h−1) [34]. The lower value obtained with CGSR tests is attributed to a higher conversion to carbonaceous deposits. In this sense, pyrolysis reactions of CG impurities such as FAMEs lead to coke formation as reported by Dou et al. [11] When O2 was added to the feed in CGOSR experiments the conversion of carbon to gas products raised to approximately 91%. This higher value obtained in CGOSR experiments suggests that, in addition to the most reactive components (methanol and glycerol), FAMEs could also react under these reaction conditions leading to gas products typical of the reforming reactions [51]. As expected, the presence of O2 in the feed promotes partial oxidation reactions leading to a decrease of H2 and the increase of CO2 concentration [52,53]. This higher CO2 concentration could also promote the reverse WGSR consuming a fraction of hydrogen. It is also shown that CGOSR allows to obtain a gaseous mixture with much lower content of light hydrocarbons. This can be explained by an easier breaking of CC bonds in the presence of O2 and/or by the ocurrence of a more cleaned catalyst surface as a consequence of the lower amount of carbon deposits [54]. The performance of the catalysts was also tested in terms of H2 yield as a function of time. As depicted in Fig. 4 , YH2 decreased continuously for all of them, thus revealing the existence of typical deactivation mechanisms such as carbon deposition and sintering [49,55]. Fouling due to physical deposition of the inorganic alkali compounds onto the catalyst surface can also result in blockage of sites and/or pores and at more advanced stages in particles disintegration. Nevertheless, alkali deposits may play a beneficial role since they favor steam gasification reactions due to their active catalytic role [46]. They can also exert a catalytic effect on the gasification of the carbonaceous deposits [47]. Fig. 4 also shows that catalysts are not affected in the same extent by deactivation. On one hand NiLaCe displays the greatest loss of activity with decays from 68% to 52% and from 84% to 70% in CGSR and CGOSR tests respectively. Deactivation by carbon formation could be specially favored on this catalyst because of its relative low basicity already shown in Fig. 3 and Table 4. The formation of CC bonds on multiple Ni atoms sites is also expected to be favored on the NiLaCe catalyst containing the larger Ni crystallites [48,49]. In the same sense, interactions between both phases would be weakened in this catalyst, thus hindering carbon gasification reactions with water, carbon dioxide chemisorbed on the mixed oxide. NiLaCeZr showed the highest stability in both kind of tests which can be ascribed to a more efficient carbon removal from the boundaries of active sites due to its highest basicity and the smaller size of Ni crystallites. Other chemical and textural properties could also affect the catalyst stability. As it was already mentioned, the higher basicity of this catalyst would also involve a higher amount of oxygen vacancies with high mobility which would contribute to stabilize catalyst particles against sintering and coking [28,29,43,54,55]. Acidity is also reported to be involved in dehydration of oxygenated intermediates giving yield to olefins which are known to be coking precursors. It must also be pointed out that O2 addition to the reagent feed improves H2 yields although it would decay on a thermodynamic basis because of the higher CG conversion to gas products as well as that of the intermediates. The quantity and nature of the carbon deposits formed in CGSR and CGOSR was investigated by TPO analysis of used catalysts and is shown in Fig. 5 . The TPO profiles of the CGSR show three different oxidation zones: one at low temperature range (300–400 °C), the second in the range (400–550 °C) and the last one observed at high temperature range (550–720 °C). Several authors have reported the occurrence of different types of carbon deposits by reaction of oxygenates, with differences in its composition and/or its location on the catalyst [32,56–60]. The peaks at the lower combustion temperatures (<450 °C) are ascribed to encapsulating carbon with amorphous nature close to the active metal particles and pointed out as the main responsible of catalyst deactivation by blocking metallic sites. The peaks at higher temperatures are usually associated to more structured carbon (filamentous and graphitic carbon) whose contribution to deactivation is hardly noticeable. Carbon deposition in SR reactions is a quite complex phenomenon since different mechanisms may be responsible for carbon formation. Ochoa et al. [60] provides a detailed discussion on the origin of the different types of carbon in the steam reforming of bio-oil oxygenates, such as alcohols, aldehydes, acids and phenols. They ascribe the formation of encapsulating carbon (which burns at low temperatures) to reactions of oxygenates in the reaction medium, which are adsorbed on the Ni sites and undergo further decomposition and/or condensation. Filamentous and graphitic carbon formation would occur from CO by the Boudouard reaction 2CO(g) → C(s) + CO2 (g) and/or light hydrocarbons decomposition (CH4, ethylene). Due to its more ordered structure and a less oxygenated composition with regard to the low temperature carbon, this type of carbon is harder to be burned. Other parameter, such as reaction temperature, steam to carbon ratio and Ni particle size also have a deep impact on the type and amount of carbon deposits. The TPO of the catalysts used in CGOSR show only one oxidation zone in the range (350–450 °C) demonstrating that all coke deposits have the same interaction with the catalyst indicating only one type of coke was produced. Oxygen is extremely reactive when compared to water and could easily react with glycerol and carbon precursors, mainly with those placed close to the metallic sites. Carbon content in used catalysts determined by TPO and elemental analysis are quite similar by both techniques and were summarized in Fig. 6 . As shown, total amount of carbon content decreases in the following order: NiLaCe > NiLaZr > NiLaCeZr. This order is inversely related to that of catalyst basicity. It is well known that the stronger the catalyst basicity, the greater the amount of CO2 adsorbed and thereby the greater the amount of carbon removed by the reaction of C + CO2 ↔ 2CO [61]. In the same way catalysts with the lower nickel particles size, observed in chemisorption experiments (NiLaZr and NiLaCeZr), exhibited lower carbon content since smaller nickel particles are reported to be more resistant to coking [62]. It is also shown that carbon deposition is significantly decreased by adding oxygen in the feed of CGOSR experiments. The reuse of the NiLaCeZr catalyst in the CGOSR process was studied at lower contact times in order to detect more quickly the influence of changes in catalyst structure on its activity. Fig. 7 shows the decrease of H2 yield from 89% to 70% in a first utilization of the fresh catalyst for 20 h. After catalyst regeneration with the O2/Ar mixture (second cycle), the initial H2 yield is partially recovered (79%) thus showing that carbon removal was not enough to fully regenerate the active sites. After the second regeneration involving the passage of the O2/Ar mixture followed by passage of liquid water, the initial H2 yield was about 85%, thus showing that the removal of alkali deposits contributes to a greater regeneration of the active sites. The elemental composition of NiLaCeZr catalyst in different stages of the deactivation/regeneration study, obtained from the EDS data, are given in Table 6 . For the fresh catalyst, the surface composition reasonably approximates the nominal value of each element. After the first O2 regeneration carbon removal was almost complete. Potassium from the ashes contained in crude glycerol started to accumulate on catalyst surface. After 40 h of reaction, the second regeneration with O2 was performed. Potassium concentration on catalyst surface was very noticeable reaching the value of 26.7 wt.%. Fermoso et al. [12] also observed alkali element (Na) present in carbon deposits, which comes from biodiesel transesterification catalyst, obtained after sorption enhanced steam reforming experiments. After washing the catalyst with water, surface composition of the catalyst returns to the initial values A picture of the spent catalyst shows the presence of alkali deposits (Fig. 8 a). XRD analysis show no significant changes in phase composition after the three 20-hours cycles of the deactivation/regeneration test (Fig. 8b). Before XRD analysis the spent catalyst was regenerated with O2/Ar and washed with distilled water. Potassium carbonate was found after the second 20-hours cycle before washing the catalyst with water (Fig. 8c). K2CO3.1.5H2O presence might be explained by adsorption of moisture during XRD analysis. All these results reveal the high thermal and chemical stability of these mixed metal oxide materials, which makes them highly suitable for their use under the experimental conditions of the steam reforming process with presence of highly corrosive alkali compounds."
8,Conclusions,"Ni-La-Me mixed oxides (Me: Ce and/or Zr) prepared by the Pechini-type polymerized complex route were tested as catalysts in the steam and oxidative steam reforming of crude glycerol at 650 °C. Catalysts obtained after a calcination temperature of 850 °C for 4 h lead contain two well defined phases, NiO and a La2Me2O7 compound. NiO is easily reduced to metallic Ni on all catalysts in the presence of pure H2 at 650 °C. Oxidative steam reforming allows to obtain the highest yields of gas products with all catalysts. The catalyst containing both Ce and Zr displayed the best catalytic performance in terms of H2 yields and low deactivation which is ascribed to a more efficient carbon removal from the boundaries of active sites. Removal of carbon and alkali metals by simple procedures allows to a significant recovery of the catalytic activity without changes in the catalyst chemical and phase structure."
