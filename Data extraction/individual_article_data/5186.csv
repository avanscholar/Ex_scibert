0,Introduction,"Currently, nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their wide range of applications in different fields such as catalysis, water purification, biodiesel production, fuel cell application, drug delivery, thin flim solar cell production, nanotoxicology etc [1–4]. Considerable afford have been devoted to nano composite materials containing metal nanoparticles, particularly copper/copper-oxide nanoparticles for its potential as a high-critical-temperature superconductor, heterogeneous catalyst, complex magnetic phase, p-type semiconductor and its use in electrochemical cells [5–8]. Recently, copper/copper-oxide nanoparticles has been extensively studied as substituent of bulk copper metal in different organic reaction such as oxidation [7], click reaction [9–11], Ullman coupling reaction [12,13], carbonylation of methanol [14] etc. The size and shape of nanoparticles as well as the nature of supporting materials on which the nanoparticles are stabilized are utmost important for providing highly active surface for catalysis. In this context, there has also been increasing interest in employing environmentally benign, cheap, easily available and robust support/stabilizing materials for the synthesis of copper nanoparticles. Earlier, we reported the environmentally benign montmorillonite support collected from western depot of Gujarat, India, and its purification and activation with mineral acid under controlled conditions to generate a high surface area matrix containing micro- and mesopores on the surface [15–20], in order to stabilize copper nanoparticles. The oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds is an important organic transformation, because of their applications in pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs, agrochemicals, plastic additives, photo initiator in UV-curing applications such as inks, imaging and clear coatings in the printing industries, precursor to useful resins and fragrances in perfumes industries [21–23]. General approach of alcohol oxidation employs the strong stoichiometric oxidizing agents such as pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), pyridinium dichromate (PDC), KMnO4, MnO2, Na2Cr2O7, (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl (TEMPO), CrO3 etc [24,25]. These oxidative operations are quite useful in laboratory, but these oxidants are expensive, hazardous or toxic. Moreover, toxic solvents are usually used to dissolve oxidizing agents and a large amount of inorganic wastes are produced after workup which makes these reagents less convenient for both environmental and economical point of view. Recently, catalytic aerobic oxidations over supported metal catalysts get much attraction because oxygen is the cheapest oxidizing agent and produces only water as by-product [26–30]. There are several reports for catalytic oxidation of alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds using primarily precious metal or metal based compounds as catalysts, such as Au [30,31], Ag [32], Pd [33,34], Ru [35,36], Os [37,38], Pt [39,40] etc. Numerous studies have also been devoted to other transition metal based catalysts, such as Ni [28,41], V [42], Co [43], Cr [44], Zn [45], Mo [46], Fe [47], Re [48] and Cu [28,29], for oxidation of alcohols with molecular oxygen. Although, many studies have been reported using transition metal catalysts, but the disadvantages of the above mentioned catalysts are the use of complex ligands or expensive metal supports or difficulty in preparation. Therefore, adaption of facile preparation method using more abundant and cheap transition metals like copper with high selective and environmental friendly system for the catalytic oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds are of great importance. So far copper nanoparticles supported montmorillonite is not explored for the oxidation of alcohols to prepare corresponding carbonyl compounds. Here, we report the catalytic performance of the copper nanoparticles supported into the nanopores of modified montmorillonite on the oxidation of different primary and secondary alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds. Moreover, systematic characterization of copper nanoparticles, reduced catalyst loading, use of cheap oxidizing agent and no over oxidized product made the present work more significant compared to our previously published articles [17,18]."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods Bentonite clay (collected from Gujarat, India) was purified to collect the < 2 μm fraction by dispersion cum sedimentation technique as they contain various impurities like silica sand, iron oxide, quartz etc. Air dried samples were then converted to the homoionic Na+-exchanged form by stirring in 2 M NaCl solution for about 72 h, washed and dialysed against distilled water until the conductivity of the water approached that of distilled water. Na-exchanged montmorillonite was characterized by XRD and basal spacing (d001) value was found to be 12.5 Å. Specific surface area determined by N2 adsorption was 105 m2/g. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) was 126 meq per 100 g of clay (sample dried at 120 °C). Most of the reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, USA and used as without further purification. Solid state UV–vis spectra were recorded at room temperature by the UV–vis spectrophotometer model Lambada 35, Perkin Elmer. Powder X-ray Diffractions were acquired on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer from 2 to 80° 2θ using CuKα source (λ = 1.54 Å). Specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter were measured by using Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, USA). Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), (made Carl Zeiss, Sigma VP) was utilized for determining the FESEM images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) patterns. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-2011 electron microscope and specimens were prepared by dispersing powder samples in isopropanol and placing them on a carbon coated copper grid and allowing them to dry. XPS experiments were performed on a Kratos ESCA model Axis 165 spectrophotometer with a position sensitive detector and hemispherical energy analyzer in an ion pumped chamber. The amount of Cu content was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Model: A Analyst, −700, Perkin Elmer). The preparation of the activated montmorillonite support as well as the stabilized copper nanoparticles prepared by adapting our earlier reported methods [17] are described below:"
3,Preparation of support,"2.2 Preparation of support 8 g of Na-montmorillonite was dispersed in 200 ml of 4 M sulphuric acid in a three necked round bottom flask and the resulting dispersion was kept at 80 °C for 1 h. After 1 h, the solution is allowed to cool and the supernatant liquid was discarded. The acid activated Na-montmorillonite was washed repeatedly in deionized water until no SO4 2− ions could be detected by the BaCl2 test. The acid activated Na-montmorillonite was recovered, dried in air at 40 ± 5 °C overnight to obtain the solid product. This acid activated montmorillonite is designated as AT-Mont."
4,Preparation of copper nanoparticles,2.3 Preparation of copper nanoparticles 5 g of AT-Mont. was taken into 250 ml round bottom flask at room temperature and 100 ml of water was added to it under stirring condition. 0.2 g of Cu(CH3COO)2 metal precursor was dissolve in minimum amount of distilled water and then added drop wise into the clay dispersion with vigorous stirring condition for 7–8 h. The resultant slurry was aged for an additional day under ambient condition followed by evaporation to dryness in a rotary evaporator. The dry clay-Cu(CH3COO)2 composite was dispersed in 50 ml water and 10 ml of aqueous solution of NaBH4 (3 mmol) was then added slowly over a 15 min in a nitrogen environment under constant stirring condition. The reaction started immediately and colour changed from blue to black due to conversion of Cu(II) into Cu(0) and the stirring was continued for another 2 h. The black solid mass was filtered and washed with distilled water several times and then dried in a desiccator for 12 h.
5,General procedure for oxidation reaction,"2.4 General procedure for oxidation reaction 1 mmol of the reactant was dissolved in 20 ml tetrahydrofuran (THF) followed by addition of 16 mg of copper nanoparticles into a two necked 100 ml round bottom flask and purged with oxygen. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 66 °C under oxygen atmosphere for a period of 4–9 h depending upon the nature of the substrates used. Upon completion of the reaction (monitored by thin layer chromatography), the catalyst was separated by simple filtration and the filtrate was poured into water. The organic product was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic fractions were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography using silica gel (60–120 mesh) with ethyl acetate/hexane as eluent to obtain the desired product. To investigate the recyclability, after separation, the used catalyst was washed with methanol followed by water and finally vacuum-dried at 40 °C before the next reaction run. The products were characterized by standard analytical techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FTIR, melting point determination and GC. All the products are known compounds and compared with data of those commercially available."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of support,"3.1 Characterization of support The oxide compositions of the clay before and after acid activation were determined by wet chemical and flame photometric methods and presented in Table 1 . Upon acid activation for 1 h, the surface area and the pore volume of AT-Mont. increase to 417 m2/g and 0.574 cm3/g from 105 m2/g and 0.232 cm3/g of the parent Na-montmorillonite respectively. Acid activation felicitate surface texture modification of layered structure of montmorillonite through partial leaching of Al from their tetrahedral and octahedral sites introducing porosity on the clay surface along with the partial retention of layered structure. The SEM images of parent Na-montmorillonite and AT-Mont. [Fig. S2 (A) and (C), supporting information] indicate the formation of porous surface on AT-Mont. which is not observed for the untreated Na-montmorillonite. The EDX patterns [Fig. S2 (B) and (D), supporting information] show a predominant amount of Si compared to Al content on the AT-Mont. surface, while Na-montmorillonite contains both Si and Al in predominant amounts. The leaching out of aluminum moiety from the clay structure inducing pores is clearly evidenced from the EDX analysis at the pores of AT-Mont. [Fig. S2 (E), supporting information] confirming the presence of silicon and oxygen only in the pores. Partial retention of layered structure was further clarified by HRTEM studies [Fig. 1 ], which distinctly shows the visible lattice fringes of d001 planes of montmorillonite. During controlled acid activation for 1 h, most of the layered structure of clay minerals are disrupted and only a fraction is retained [Fig. 1], which is also substantiated by CEC value [Table 1] of acid activated clay (42 meq per 100 g of clay) compared to parent Na-montmorillonite (126 meq per 100 g of clay). The detailed characterization was reported in our previously published papers [16–20]."
8,Characterization of supported copper nanoparticles,"3.2 Characterization of supported copper nanoparticles The preliminary investigation of the formation of copper nanoparticles into the pores of modified montmorillonite was provided by UV–vis spectroscopy [Fig. 2 ]. The UV–vis spectra of the prepared copper nanoparticles show two extinction bands, which typically have two (in-plane and out-of-plane) plasmon modes [49]. The broad peak in the range 380–630 nm contain a contribution from the copper interband transitions below 600 nm, while the broad and weak band at 450 nm may be attributed to the out-of-plane dipolar mode. Thus, the appearances of the broad band indicates the formation of copper(0) nanoparticles [49]. The crystalline natures of the copper nanoparticles were confirmed by their corresponding powder XRD pattern [Fig. 3 ]. The XRD shows three peaks of 2θ values 43.3, 50.3 and 74.1° which are assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) indices of fcc lattice of metallic Cu (JCPDS No. 85–1326) [50,51]. XPS spectrum of the Cu 2p region [Fig. 4 (A)] shows two copper bands, 2p3/2 at 932.4 eV and 943.0 eV, which are in good agreement with the metallic copper(0) and CuO respectively [7,52,53]. The moderately broad O1s core-level spectrum observed at 533.5 eV revealed the presence of O2− of CuO [Fig. 4 (B)] [7]. SEM-EDX analysis also confirmed the formation of spherical nanoparticles into the nanopores of AT-Mont. [Fig. 5 (A)]. Moreover, EDX analysis [Fig. 5(B)] indicates the presence of copper on the surface of modified montmorillonite along with other elements of the clay. The elemental dot mapping [Fig. 6 ] clearly shows the homogeneous distribution of Cu throughout the support. The TEM image of the nanoparticle composites [Fig. 7 ] shows that copper nanoparticles having a spherical morphology and are well dispersed on the nanoporous support. The micrographs also indicate that the particles have sizes less than 10 nm. Some of the copper nanoparticles are found to be larger than the pore size of the support [Fig. 1 (B)]. HRTEM image of a single copper nanoparticles [Fig. 8 (A) and (C)] shows that particles have reticular lattice planes with inter-planar lattice fringe spacing of about 0.21 nm, which corresponds to the (111) plane of fcc copper crystals [7]. By focusing the electron beam on the nanoparticle lying on the TEM grid, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of copper nanoparticles was found [Fig. 8(B)], where the hexagonal symmetrical diffraction spot patterns indicate the single crystalline nature of copper nanoparticles. The Cu content in the clay supported copper nanoparticles composites is found to be 0.8 wt%."
9,Catalytic activity,"3.3 Catalytic activity The oxidation of alcohol towards carbonyl compounds catalysed by copper nanoparticles-montmorillonite is presented in Scheme 1 . Solvents play a significant role in the chemical reaction and the effect of solvents on the reaction [Table S1 (supporting information)] was investigated on benzyl alcohol as model substrate. It was found that the most appropriate solvent in which the catalyst proceeded efficiently is THF with 97.8% conversion under refluxing condition. This may be due to the moderate polarity (dielectric constant 7.5) and aprotic nature of THF which facilitate better contact of the catalyst with the substrate. The reaction was also investigated under solvent-free conditions and only 55.2% conversion was observed. In order to illuminate the active sites of the catalyst, two blank reactions were performed with or without the montmorillonite support (AT-Mont.) as catalyst in THF solvent. However, no product was detected in any of the two reactions indicating that the copper nanoparticles are the active catalytic sites of the catalyst. The oxidation of different alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds carried out in presence of copper nanoparticles with various substituted reactants are summarized in Table 2 . Both primary and secondary alcohols were oxidized to their corresponding carbonyl compounds with very good to excellent yields (54–97.8%) and 100% selectivity. In order to widen the scope of oxidation reaction, substituted benzyl alcohol and substituted 1-phenyl ethanol were also tested. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol and 1-phenyl ethanol having electron donating group resulted corresponding carbonyl compounds in good yield [Entry 4, 6 & 7, Table 2]. In case of electron withdrawing substituted benzyl alcohol, the yields are comparatively less than that of the electron rich counterparts [Entry 5, Table 2]. After completion of the oxidation reactions, the catalyst was recovered by filtration and vacuum dried at 40 °C before using in the next run. The catalyst remains active for several runs without significant lost of efficiency [Entry 1, Table 2]. No over oxidized product was noticed for any oxidation process. It is well known that the adsorption of substrate molecules to the surface of the catalyst is the main factor for determining the catalytic activity. Transition metals and metal oxides (particularly copper) may accommodate a higher proportion of oxygen in their lattice position compared to others [54]. This helps the oxidation of alcohol to the corresponding carbonyl compounds under mild conditions presumably due to tenacious oxygen retention and oxygen-activating property of copper nanoparticles. The presence of surface oxygen makes the oxidation entropically favorable and the most probable mechanism is via the abstraction of α-hydrogen by the surface oxygen [26,55–58]. The recovered catalyst was further investigated by N2-adsorption-desorption analysis, powder XRD and TEM to check if any morphological changes that might occur to the catalyst (copper nanoparticles) during the catalytic reaction. The specific surface area of the recovered catalyst decrease to 218 (after 1 st run), 193 (after 2nd run) and 122 (after 3rd run) compared to 296 m2/g of freshly prepared catalyst. This decrease in surface area of the catalyst may be due to the reason that, after each successive run, the nanopores were clogged by the reactant/product molecules or the breakdown of the pore walls of the catalyst support occurred and led to formation of larger pores; because the BJH pore size distribution curve [Fig. 9 ] of the recovered catalyst shows a gradual broadening of the distribution pattern compared to fresh catalyst. The similar shapes of the isotherms reveal that the catalyst retained their mesoporous nature even after the 3rd run [Fig. S3, supporting information]. The powder XRD spectra of recovered catalyst [Fig. 10 ], shows peaks at around the 2θ values 36 and 54°, apart from the characteristic peaks of metallic Cu(0) indicating conversion of considerable amount of copper to CuO after the 1 st run of the reaction, whereas for the fresh catalyst it was below the detection limit of XRD [7]. However, this conversion seems to be beneficial due to higher oxygen retention capacity of CuO [7]. The elemental dot mapping of recovered catalyst [Fig. S4, supporting information] shows almost similar homogenous distributions of copper on the support as obtained in the fresh catalyst. The TEM images of the recovered catalyst [Fig. S5, supporting information] confirms that the copper nanoparticles are stable inside the clay matrix but small fractions of the particles were agglomerated to form bigger sizes. From AAS analysis, the Cu content in the recovered catalyst after third run was found to be 0.74 wt% which indicates that only a very small amounts of copper were leaching out from clay matrix. Therefore, the catalyst remained active for several catalytic runs without significant loss of its efficiency. A comparison of several previously reported catalysts with the present work for oxidation reactions is presented in Table 3 , which indicates that the present catalyst is better compared to earlier reports in terms of yield, reaction temperature and catalyst recovery."
10,Conclusion,"Stabilized spherical copper nanoparticles having size below 10 nm, generated into the micro- and mesopores of acid activated montmorillonite, demonstrated high catalytic activity in oxidation of potential primary and secondary aromatic alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds within short reaction time with very good to excellent yields (54–97.8%) and 100% selectivity. The nanocatalysts could be reused for several times without significant loss of their activity under the same reaction conditions. The recovered catalysts characterized by the different analytical techniques like XRD, HRTEM and N2 adsorption-desorption demonstrated no significant change in size and shape of the copper nanoparticles. The operational simplicity and robustness of the catalyst as well as environmentally friendly reaction conditions surpasses previous catalytic systems and make it attractive for the large scale synthesis of the industrially important carbonyl compounds."
