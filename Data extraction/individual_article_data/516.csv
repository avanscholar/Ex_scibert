0,Introduction,"Numerous key commercial bulk and fine chemicals are aromatic compounds ultimately derived from non-renewable petroleum feedstocks [1]. Production of valued-added small aromatic monomers via catalytic or bio-catalytic lignin depolymerization continues to be an important task for scientists and industries worldwide. In this context, Lignin is the most abundant, renewable carbon feedstock containing aromatics which endows it with exceptional advantage in producing higher value-added products [2,3]. Lignin is a complex aromatic biopolymer and the most bulky recalcitrant of the three components of lignocellulosic biomass accounts for nearly 30% of the organic carbon on the planet [4,5]. Biomass-to-ethanol process utilizes only the fractions of cellulose and hemicellulose, leaving lignin as a by-product. Additionally, paper and pulp industries also generate large amounts of lignin and are often burnt to provide heat energy to boilers [6]. Nonetheless, the chemical structure of this biopolymer has potential to be a good source of aromatic chemicals and fuels in future if it could be deconstructed into monomers in a sustainable manner [7]. Consequently, the valorization of lignin has become asubject of intense research for socio-economic and resource sustainability [8–11]. Therefore, the development of effective lignin depolymerization methods will play an important role in the conversion of lignin to produce valuable platform chemicals [6,7]. At present, the reported methods in the literature for lignin utilization include pyrolysis [8–10], catalytic oxygen depolymerization [11,12], hydrogenolysis [13,14], acid alkali hydrolysis [15,16]. The hydrogenation procedure can substantially increase the product stability and effectively inhibits the repolymerization reactions, which has a good promotion on the yield of phenolic monomers. Heterogeneous catalysis is used in most cases due to the advantages of easy recycling and strong operability [17] with the two main factors of metal site and basic-acid site. As for the metal site, it is the main active site to catalyze the hydrogenolysis of C–O bonds. The combination of metal and support as the bifunctional catalyst is also a good choice to achieve a good hydrogenolysis performance of lignin [18,19]. Lignin depolymerization was carried out by Kloekhorst et al., and they found that at temperature 400 °C under high pressure of 100 bar with Ru/C catalysts produced higher bio-oil 75.0%. While bio-oil analysis showed that phenol 20.5% was the main compounds with 14% aromatic compounds. They also got some of cyclohexanes compounds but the amount was low [20]. Further another research group investigated the lignin depolymerization with the different metal supports catalyst under high pressure of hydrogen 230 bar at 400 °C. The bio-oil yield 56% was found with Ni metal supported on CeO2/CNF catalysts. Bio-oil mainly consisting of methoxyl functional compounds while catalysts did not promoted the hydrogenation reaction; hence suitable catalysts need to be endorsed for the active hydrogenation reaction [21]. Different metal supports catalysts (Pt/C, Rh/C, Ru/C, and Pd/C) and (CoMo/Al2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3) on lignin hydrogenation were examined by Figueirêdo et al. They found that at 500 °C in presence of 10 bar hydrogen gas with Pd/C catalysts produced higher bio-oil 63.0% with 59.% phenolic compounds. While other did not promoted the bio-oil yield however these catalysts promoted the hydrogenation reaction. They concluded that suitable metal catalyst could be produced a higher monomer phenolic compound while with CoMo/Al2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst a higher amount of aromatic hydrocarbon produced [17]. It was seen that the catalysts composition, morphology, and activity depended on the biomass lignin sources [22,23]. Moreover, noble metal catalytic lignin depolymerization was studied widely in last few years owing to its efficiency for the production of high yield of quality bio-oil, which contains large amount of phenolic monomer compound. There are many studies on hydrogenolysis reaction of lignin with different high cost noble metal catalyst. Hence, the novelty of this work is to utilize the waste egg shell byproduct derived activated CaO as a metal catalyst on TiO2 support for lignin hydrogenolysis depolymerization. Here, we carried out a systematic catalysts preparations and catalytic CaO/TiO2 clacinated at different temperature such as 600, 700, 800 and 900 °C at different temperatures (250, 280 and 310 °C), reaction time (15.) and in different solvents (water, ethanol, and methanol) in different reaction environment (N2 and H2). The products were analyzed with the help of NMR, FT-IR, GC-MS, elemental analysis, and GPC. Moreover catalytic recyclability of the catalysts has been investigated."
1,Materials and method,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Alkali lignin, TiO2 collected from Sigma Aldrich.co.Ltd. All the chemicals used are of analytical grade and not further purified for reaction process. The chicken eggshells were mainly collected from paltry farm, china after peeling the outer layer of boiled eggs. All the eggshells were cleaned thoroughly in water and dried. After drying the shells were crushed in a mortar and pestle to get the white powder."
3,Preparation of CaO/TiO2 catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of CaO/TiO2 catalyst CaO/TiO2 was prepared by mechano-chemical method using mortar and pestle. The crushed eggshells were calcined at 900 °C in a tubular furnace at static air condition for 5h to convert the calcium carbonate (main constituents) present in eggshell into CaO species. After that eggshells 900 °C and TiO2 were ground and mixed finely using mortar pestle, Then the CaO immobilized TiO2 was calcined at various calcination temperature varying from 600 to 900 °C with atomic ratio Ca/Ti as (5:1) in a tubular furnace for 3h. Different synthesis catalysts are denoted in the manuscript as CaO/TiO2 600 = CT-600, CaO/TiO2-700 = CT-700, CaO/TiO2-800 = CT-800, and CaO/TiO2-900 = CT-900."
4,Characterization of catalysts and bio-oil,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts and bio-oil The X-ray diffraction pattern of synthesized CaO/TiO2 catalysts were recorded on Rigaku miniflex X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation of wave length 1.54A° at 40 kV and 30 mA.The synthesized catalysts were scanned in a 2θ range of 10–90° with step size of 0.02 and scanning rate of 10 °min-1.The scanning electron microscopy (TEM) was used for the study of morphology of synthesized catalyst at the operating voltage of 10 kV.The presence of various functional groups in synthesized CaO/TiO2 catalysts were studied by fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) using a Nicolet 5700 spectrometer. The wave number range maintained at 400-4000 cm−1 and KBr pellets were used as reference for measurement. The basic strength and basic sites (in terms of mmol per unit weight) of catalyst was calculated by Hammett indicator titration method. The indicators like phenolphthalein (H = 9.6), 4-nitroaniline (H = 18.6), 2,4- dinitroaniline (H = 15.4), bromothymol blue (H = 7.8) were used in titration process to determine the basic strength of the synthesized CaO/TiO2 catalyst. Generally 30 mg of catalyst sample was taken in conical flax and 1.5–2.0 mL of indicator solution was added drop wise followed by addition of 15 mL of methanol and kept for 1h to equilibrate. Then the sample solution was titrated against 0.01 N benzoic acid solution and the obtained titre value signifies the number of mili moles of benzoic acid required to neutralize 30 mg of sample. The basicity of catalyst was measured in terms of millimoles per gram (mmol/g). Thermal stability of synthesized CaO/TiO2 green catalyst was analyzed by thermo-gravimetric and differential scanning calorimeter analysis (TGA-DSC) using Mettler Toledo DSC1 instrument within temperature range of 50–1000 °C. NMR-Bruker 500 Plus instrument was used for the analysis of the type of protons present in bio-oil. DMSO was used as a solvent for dissolution of bio-oil. GC-MS was used for the identification of compounds present in the oil and gas. These analyses have been carried out using Agilent Technologies (HP7890 instrument) GC-FID has been operated in split-less mode while GC-MS in split mode with a split ratio of 1:50. Each step of the reaction system has been operated with the same type of column for example a fused capillary column HP-5 of 30 m length and 0.32 mm internal diameter with a film thickness of 0.25 μm. Helium was used as a carrier gas for the GC-MS while nitrogen for the GCFID at a flow rate of 1.8 mL/min. The 1 μl of oil sample was injected at a temperature of 300 °C over each of the GC-FID and GC-MS. The column was isothermal at 50 °C for 2 min at a ramp rate of (5 °C/min). Subsequently, the temperature was programmed and rose to 180 °C at (10 °C/min) which further raised to 250 °C at (20 °C/min) and then 300 °C for (5min). Bio-oil elements contents investigate was carried out by Vario Micro Cube unit, Germany."
5,Reaction procedure,"2.4 Reaction procedure A high-pressure autoclave reactor (30 mL) was used to carry out reactions. In each reaction, 1 gm alkali lignin and 20.0 wt% (0.2 gm) catalysts were taken with 10 gm solvent (water, ethanol, and methanol). To evacuate the inside air from the reactor, five times purging was carried out. Then, the required amount of pressure and reaction temperature was used for reaction. The mechanical stirrer was run at 280 rpm. Then the reactor was heated to the desired temperature at residence time of 15 min. After that, tap water was used to cool the reactor. Solid residue and the catalyst were separated by filtration using ethyl acetate as an extractive solvent for water, while, for an alcoholic solvent, alcohol (ethanol and methanol) was used. The ethyl acetate/alcoholic solvent was removed from the bio-oil using a rotary evaporator. The solid residue was dried at 105 °C for overnight. As reactions were carried out in duplicates, average values were taken. The calculations for yield of the products are done using following equations: B i o ‐ o i l y i e l d ( w t . % ) = W e i g h t o f B i o ‐ o i l W e i g h t o f L i g n i n f e e d × 100 S o l i d r e s i d u e y i e l d ( w t . % ) = W e i g h t o f S o l i d r e s i d u e W e i g h t o f L i g n i n f e e d × 100 G a s y i e l d ( w t . % ) = 100 − ( B i o ‐ o i l y i e l d + s o l i d r e s i d u e y i e l d )"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization The X-ray diffraction pattern of CaO/TiO2 derived from eggshell waste calcined at different temperature ranges 600–900 °C was shown in figure (1) . The intense peaks observed at 2θ = 25.54°,37.45°, 47.67°, 59.92°, 62.91° corresponds to (101), (004), (200), (211) and (204) respectively are the orientation planes of anatase phase of TiO2 matched with JCPDS file (01-071-1166). Another prominent pattern related to cubic phase of CaO are observed at 2θ = 32.26°, 37.40°,53.92°,64.24° with miller indices values (111) (200) (220),(311) respectively which matched with JCPDS file 821690 [22]. The XRD pattern also shown the reflection peaks at 36.15°,39.27°, 62.89°,76.71° corresponds to miller indices values (101),(200),(002),(202) are due to rutile phase of TiO2 which matched with JCPDS file 894920. The very small reflection peaks at 41.10°,79. 31° with miller indices values (311) and (810) confirmed the formation of mixed oxide structure of Ti2CaO4 which matched with JCPDS file −721134. The intensity of all the diffracted peaks increased with subsequent rise of calcinations temperature from 600 to 900 °C suggesting the well crystalline nature of the catalyst. The average crystallite size CaO/TiO2 catalyst at 900 °C was determined from the most intense peak (2θ = 25.34°) using Scherrer equation and found to be 31 nm. It was obtained that with increase in calcination temperature the intensity of diffraction peaks increased and the crystallite phase of the catalyst became more regular. The calcination treatment of Ca/Ti from 600 to 900 °C enhanced the crystallite size of catalyst from 23 nm to 31 nm which might be due to agglomeration of CaO at higher calcination temperature. The X-ray diffraction pattern mainly shows the presence of CaO, TiO2 crystalline phases when the calcinations temperature was about 600°–700 °C but as the calcination temperature increased to 900 °C there was clear appearance of phase transformation also. The phase transformation of cubic CaO and tetragonal TiO2 to Orthorhombic Ti2CaO4 at 900 °C. The surface morphology study of eggshell derived TiO2 supported 3CaO/TiO2 green nano catalyst calcined at various temperatures was studied by TEM electron microscope (Fig. 2 ). All the samples calcined at different temperature have spherical morphology with variable grain sizes. The average particle size of CaO/TiO2 catalyst calcined at 900 °C was about 186 nm, where as the particle size of CaO/TiO2 catalyst calcined at 600 °C was about 123 nm. Such type of results implied that calcination temperature has significant role on particle size. The particle size of the catalyst increases in the order as CaO/TiO2 (600) < CaO/TiO2 (700) < CaO/TiO2 (800) <CaO/TiO2 (900). It proved that calcination at high temperature tends to agglomeration of the sample particles. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of synthesized CaO/TiO2 catalyst calcined at 900 °C were analyzed by BET-BJH method. Similarly the N2 adsorption desorption curve of that CaO/TiO2 catalyst showed in Fig. 3 . The specific surface area of the catalyst was 21.73 m2/g where as the pore volume and pore diameter of the catalyst were 0.0132 cm3/g and 3. 062 nm respectively. As the pore diameter of the catalyst lies in the range of 0–50 nm as a result the catalyst exhibited mesoporous in nature with type IV hysteresis loop [9]. The basic strength of waste egg shell derieved CaO/TiO2 with different calcinations temperature was measured using Hammett indicator method. The basic strength for pure CaO was very low (9.3 mmol/g) but all the CaO/TiO2 calcined catalysts exhibits higher basic strength (15.0–18.4 mmol/g). The total amounts of basic sites of synthesized catalysts were calculated through titration method. It was obtained that the basic site of CaO/TiO2 increased from 33.92 to 42.67 mmol/g with increase temperature. In this work we found that the basic strength as well as the amount of basic sites is mainly responsible for catalytic activity of CaO/TiO2. As it is well known that higher basic strength of the catalyst can promote lignin conversion percentage but extremely high basic strength leads to reduces lignin bio-oil yield so the best catalyst for lignin conversion have moderate basic strength of 15.0–18.4 as well as high amount of basic sites [21,22]."
8,Products yield distribution,"3.2 Products yield distribution 3.2.1 Catalysts activity under different solvents The effects of different catalysts with different solvents on lignin depolymerization products yield are given in Fig. 4 a-water, 4b-ethanol, and 4c-methanol solvents. From the Fig. 5 a it was seen that the use of water solvent with CT-700 catalyst gave maximum bio-oil (35.8 wt%) compared to the other catalyst CT-600 (28.5 wt%), CT-800 (34.6 wt%), CT-900 (34.1 wt%) and non-catalytic reaction (22.3 wt%). Higher bio-oil yield observed in the case of bimetallic CT-700 catalyst might be due to the lower basicity means higher acidic character, which promoted the degradation of lignin's C–C and C–O–C bonds. Moreover, higher amount of bio-residue yields were found with water solvent, which is due to the water cannot dissolved lignin efficiently due to the lower dielectric constant and also lignin hydrophobic nature. However, interestingly with ethanol and methanol solvent, the higher bio-oil yield was found 71.8 wt% and 68.6 wt% with CT-800 catalyst, respectively. The non-catalytic reaction under ethanol and methanol solvents gave significantly lower bio-oil yield (55.0 wt% and 53.7 wt%)). When ethanol and methanol solvent were used, the bio-oil yield difference was negligible for non-catalytic depolymerization, and the same observation was also observed by Ref. [20]. The higher bio-oil yield was obtained with alcoholic solvent compared to water, and alcoholic solvents have lower dielectric constant, lower critical temperature and pressure, which accelerate the lignin macromolecule degradation. Hence, both alcoholic solvent (ethanol and methanol) and metal-supported catalyst showed synergistic effect during lignin depolymerization [24]. Minimum bio-residue (19.7 wt%) was found in case of non-catalytic reaction with methanol solvent while higher gas (19.7 wt%) was observed under ethanol solvent. The solvent properties and catalyst properties effects the yield of the products. Since adding the alcoholic solvents, the effects of the catalyst on lignin liquefaction significantly increased. Additionally, alcoholic solvent acts as a hydrogen source, which provoked the lignin depolymerization on catalyst surface. 3.2.2 Effects of nitrogen and hydrogen gas and pressure The effect of nitrogen and hydrogen pressure was also studied here to understand the hydrogenalysis behavior during lignin depolymerization (Fig. 5a and b). Both the lignin liquefaction and product distribution could be effectively promoted by adjusting the initial N2 and H2 pressure. In the presence of nitrogen, pressure did not affect significantly on lignin depolymerization and bio-oil changes were observed very less. However, using hydrogen gas, product distributions have been seen altered significantly. The results showed that 75.0 wt% of lignin could be liquefied yielded the case of 5 bar pressure of hydrogen. With the increase of hydrogen pressure from 5 bar to 10 bar, the lignin hydrogenolysis performance was gradually improved, and 82.8 wt% of lignin could be converted with very low amount of unreacted lignin (3.8 wt%). when the hydrogen pressure increased 10–15 bar, the yield of bio-oil decreased but the lignin liquefaction conversion degree kept increases with higher gas yield. Higher bio-oil yield or conversion was found with CT-800 catalysts due to the basic nature of the catalysts enhanced the formation of hydrogen radical, which is promoted the lignin depolymerization. Moreover, in comparison of products yield, this can be mainly ascribed to the enhancement of hydrogenation of phenolic monomers and aromatic ring-opening reactions under increased H2 pressure, and the monomer products were thus consumed, resulting in the decreased yield [25]. 3.2.3 Effects of temperature, reaction time and catalyst amount Temperature being one of the important parameter in hydrogenolysis reaction of lignin, the reaction process was carried out by varying the temperature from 250 to 310 °C keeping all other parameters constant. Temperature effect on conversion and yield percentage of bio-oil depicted in Fig. 6 a. There was steady increase of conversion of lignin with rise of temperature from 250 to 310 °C. At the beginning when temperature was 250 °C the conversion of lignin was about 77.7% which reached to 96.9% conversion with increasing temperature up to 300 °C. However maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at 280 °C, which implied that higher temperature in the presence of catalysts and hydrogen provoked the condensable products into higher gas yield and also dehydrogenation and condensation reaction of by-product during lignin depolyemrization [21,24]. It was clearly concluded that the optimum temperature for higher bio-oil yield of from lignin depolymerization was 280 °C. Furthermore, the effect of catalyst dosages was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 6b, the increase in CT-800 dosage enhanced the degree of liquefaction degree. When 20 wt% catalyst was used, the lignin liquefaction conversion 96.2% was obtained. With the dosage increased to 30 wt% the lignin liquefaction conversion was increased to 97.2%, where the yield of bio-oil was decreased to 78.8 wt%. The lower conversion 88.4% was observed in the case of 10 wt% catalyst, which might be due to the unavailability of the required active surface or basicity for C–O–C and C–C linkage break [6,26]. Furthermore, a higher amount of 30 wt% gave a higher amount of gas yield with lower bio-oil yield compared to 20.0 wt% catalyst."
9,Bio-oil analysis,"3.3 Bio-oil analysis 3.3.1 GC-MS analysis of bio-oils GC-MS analysis shows that 27 major compounds were identified and quantified in the reaction products. These types of compounds have been reported in earlier studies [6,8,24]. The concentrations of different compounds do not seem to show a clear relationship with the lignin to catalyst weight ratio used during the reaction. These results are plotted in Fig. 7 and table in supplementary information to show relative concentrations of different compounds type produced. CT-800 catalyst under hydrogen pressure had maximum 38.2% yield of chyclohexanes and 19% yield of aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover in case nitrogen environment, the dominance of phenols indicated that the methoxy groups on the aromatic rings in lignin were more easily interrupted in the presence of a large amount of basic sites given by CT-800 catalysts support [27]. Comparatively, nitrogen environment in presence of catalyst preferred to produce more alkyl phenols and methoxy phenols compounds with 68% yield of alkyl phenols and 24% yield of methoxy phenols sue to the braking of various lignin linkages such as C–O and C–C bonds. However with the presence of hydrogen, alkyl phenol s and methoxy are participated in the deoxygenation and hydrogenation reaction and produced higher amount of cycholohexane and aromatic hydrocarbons. As for the Ru/C-acid catalyst, the product distribution fell in the range between Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/C catalysts, with 14.5 wt% yields of phenols and 16.6 wt% yields of guaiacols. The highly dispersed metal site preferred to promote the occurrence of hydrogenolysis of C–O bond and the basic site of CaO enabled to weaken the C–O bonds [28,29]. The synergistic effects between them improved the depolymerization and hydrogenolysis reactions greatly, resulting in a high yield of phenolic monomers. Syringols, guaiacols and phenols were the main phenolic monomers at the initial stage. Under the catalysis and hydrogen demethoxylation, deoxygenation and hydrogenation occurred and phenols and methoxy phenols were reduced and converted to aromatic hydrocarbon and chyclohexanes compounds. 3.3.2 Functional groups analysis of bio-oils by NMR and FT-IR The 1H NMR spectra of the optimum liquefaction reaction bio-oils were investigated and are shown in Fig. 8 . The integrated peak area of different types of functional compounds protons was divided into various regions and compared here. It was observed that the maximum peak area percentage of 48% protons in the 0.5–3.0 ppm region was found in the presence of hydrogen gas with catalyst under the ethanol, while 40% was observed under nitrogen gas. It is due the in the presence of hydrogen gas higher amount of aliphatic compounds or cyclohexanes compounds produced. The next 1H NMR region is 3.0–4.5 ppm, which is attributed to the proton of (-O-CH3) methoxy functional group or oxygenated compounds [24], which is the common structure hold in the coniferyl (G) and sinapyl alcohols (S) derivatives. The bio-oil of non-catalytic reaction in the presence of nitrogen gas showed the highest (29%) of methoxy proton, while with hydrogen gas it showed less 26%. This is also in well accordance with the GC-MS results that the methoxy functional compounds increased with the non-catalytic reaction during the lignin depolynerization reaction (Fig. 7).The aromatic protons are present in the bio-oils confirmed from the 6.0–8.0 ppm region spectra [30,31]. The peak area percentage of the aromatic proton was a maximum at 26% in the presence of hydrogen gas without catalyst with ethanol solvent, this due to the without catalyst in the presence of hydrogen hydrogenation reaction could not occurred. Further for the more evidence FT-IR analysis of bio-oil was analyzed. Similar spectra of the three different samples were exhibited, with a little difference on some groups stretching bands (Fig. 9 ). The peak at 3429 cm−1 corresponded to the O–H stretching in phenolic compounds [32], and the peak at 1705 cm−1 and 1606 cm−1 were assigned to the vibrations of the carbonyl group and the benzene structure, respectively [31]. It can be seen that the bio-oil with CT-800 catalyst possessed somewhat larger amount of aromatic compounds and benzene structure compared to others, which was consistent with its better catalytic hydrogenolysis performance. Fundamental vibration bands at 1270, 1205, and 1040 cm−1 frequency were observed corresponding to Ar–O linkages of methoxy functional-group containing phenolic compounds in case of non-catalytic and catalytic lignin depolymerization reaction in the presence of nitrogen gas [31]. This also suggested that the synergistic effect induced by the great extent of metal dispersion and the large amount of basic catalyst would cause the enhancement of lignin liquefaction and phenolic monomer production."
10,Elemental and molecular weight distribution analysis,"3.4 Elemental and molecular weight distribution analysis An elemental distribution in the bio-oil illustrates the bio-oil quality. Here we analyzed elemental distribution study of alkali lignin and bio-oil obtained from non-catalytic and catalytic liquefaction reaction and shown in Table 1 . Alkali lignin contains carbon element (56 wt%) while lignin depolymerization bio-oil showed increasing carbon contents under a different reaction system. However, using the catalysts in the lignin depolymerization the carbon contents significantly increase as 73.5 wt%, and 83.6 wt% by the use of CT-800 catalyst in presence of nitrogen and hydrogen gas. Moreover, the oxygen content in the bio-oil obtained using catalysts under hydrogen environment was much lower than the bio-oil of non-catalytic depolymerization. It implied that the uses of catalysts the hydrodeoxygenation or decarboxylation enhanced significantly compared to non-catalytic liquefaction [32], which is also confirmed the O/C atomic ratio analysis with the introduction of catalyst, decreased the O/C ratio by reduction of oxygen content in bio-oil. It can be seen from with the decreasing of O/C ratio high heating value (HHV) markedly increased. Highest HHV (36.3 MJ/kg) was obtained in the presence of CT-800 catalyst in presence of hydrogen gas under ethanol solvent. It showed excellent hydrogenation capably under ethanol solvent [33]. However, slightly lower HHV value (32.5 MJ/kg) was found with CT-800 under nitrogen environment. This could be confirmed from GC-MS result that liquefaction bio-oil obtained with CT-800 showed more aromatic hydrocarbon. GPC measurement was also investigated to characterize the bio-oils. As the results shown in Table 2 . The bio-oil products derived from non-catalytic reaction had the largest weight average molecular weight (Mw). The condensation of the depolymerization products induced by the phenolic monomer compounds as it is contain oxygen functional groups probably the reason for it. Not only can the basic or acid sites catalyze the cleavage of C–O bonds, but they promoted the condensation process of produced monomers as well [34]. CT-800 catalyst had a good metal dispersion, which possessed a high hydrogenation catalytic activity and enabled to suppress the condensation process; so that it exhibited the smallest Mw. However, different reaction environment exhibited different capability for the depolymerization of lignin macromolecules into monomer compounds. Hence, under hydrogen gas catalytic reaction exhibited low Mw value between compared to the others reaction conditions. This result also indicated that the lignin hydrogenolysis process was influenced by the synergistic effect of metal basic sites."
11,Reusability study of catalysts,"The catalytic activity, potential, stability and recyclability of synthesized CaO/TiO2 catalyst was studied by performing reusability experiments (Fig. 10 ). Catalyst was recovered by several time washing with acetone solvent and calination at 500 °C in the presence of oxygen to remove carbon in the form of CO2 and CO. For this study consecutive batch reaction were performed and found that the catalyst was stable up to fifth runs. With increasing reuse cycle both the conversion percentage and bio-oil yield was not affected but after second run there was a sudden decrease of conversion to 90.1% and depletion of both conversion and bio-oil yield percentage respectively taken place. The loss in catalytic activity might be due to leaching of both the metal atoms and blockage of the pores of the active sites of CT-800 catalyst. In order to find the reason behind the deactivation of catalytic property leaching test was done through hot filtration method. The yield percentage of cyclohexane and cyclohexanol were decreased slightly with the recyclability run (Fig. 11 ). After fourth run, cyclohexane and cyclohexanol decreased to 18.1% and 8.3% from fresh catalysts run 21.7% and 11.8%."
12,Conclusions,"Catalytic hydrogenolysis depolymerization of lignin with green CaO/TiO2 catalysts efficiently converted lignin macromolecules into higher monomeric compounds. Maximum bio-oil yield was found with CaO/TiO2-800 catalysts under ethanol solvent with 10 bar hydrogen pressure at 280 °C. Nitrogen environment in presence of catalyst preferred to produce more alkyl phenols and methoxy phenols compounds with 68% yield of alkyl phenols and 24% yield of methoxy phenols sue to the braking of various lignin linkages such as C–O and C–C bonds. Other compounds present were in minor concentration. Using the catalysts in the lignin depolymerization the carbon contents significantly increase as 73.5 wt%, and 83.6 wt% by the use of CT-800 catalyst in presence of nitrogen and hydrogen gas. CT-800 catalyst had a good metal dispersion, which possessed a high hydrogenation catalytic activity and enabled to suppress the condensation process; so that it exhibited the smallest Mw. This process could provide a significant source for in-situ hydrogenation process for the production fuel grade bio-oil."
