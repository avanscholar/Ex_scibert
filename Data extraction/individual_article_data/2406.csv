0,Introduction,"The H2 production using the well-known reforming technology with biomass-derived substrates could contribute in the medium term to the implementation of a hydrogen-based energy system using fuel cells. This may lead to a lower environmental impact than the current use of fossil sources for H2 production. In this way, biomass-derived resources can be considered as an alternative feedstock for hydrogen and syngas production [1–3]. Today, great efforts are being made to use biomass resources, including agricultural residues and lignocellulosic materials, for the production of chemicals and fuels. There is expected to be a gradual development of new bio-refinery processes and a consequent increase in the availability of different biomass-derived substrates [4–6]. In this context, an increase in the production of biomass-derived alcohols which could be used as renewable sources of hydrogen is expected. Nowadays, ethanol is the main bio-alcohol produced and its production is gradually increasing worldwide. This is one of the reasons why hydrogen production from ethanol has been a subject of research interest [1,7–12]. However, other alcohols such as propanol and butanol have high energy density and low hygroscopicity and can be considered of further interest for energetic purposes. Both n-propanol and n-butanol can be produced via fermentation of sugary biomass and the use of lignocellulosic biomass for their production is also envisaged [13,14]. The steam reforming of methanol and ethanol for hydrogen production has been widely investigated and mainly Cu, Ni, Co and noble metals supported in a variety of oxides have been used as catalysts. However, to our knowledge, there are few studies dealing with the reformation processes of n-butanol [15,16] and no articles have been published on the reforming of n-propanol. When oxidative steam reforming (OSR) processes are used, both the hydrogen yield and the energy balance depend on the steam/carbon and oxygen/carbon ratios in the incoming flow of reactants: CnH(2n+1)OH + xO2 + (2n − 2x − 1)H2O → (3n − 2x)H2 + nCO2 Although the steam reforming can lead to a higher H2 yield than OSR, it is a highly endothermic process and thus energetically less favored than OSR. Moreover, a major drawback of the steam reforming is the deactivation of catalysts by carbon deposition. In OSR the support can play a key role in the behaviour of the catalysts. The oxygen mobility of the support is expected to exert a strong influence on the process and can help to prevent the formation of carbon deposits and thus reduce the deactivation of the catalysts [17,18]. The O2 storage capacity of ZrO2-based systems depends not only on the cation incorporated but on its loading and the method used for the preparation of the solids [19–24]. Steam-reforming and OSR of ethanol have recently been studied over several Ni/Y2O3–ZrO2 catalysts [22,23]. Song and col. studied the catalytic performance of Ni/Y2O3–ZrO2 (20% Ni wt/wt, Y/Zr = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 M ratio) in the OSR of ethanol. The catalyst with Y/Zr = 0.1 (molar ratio) showed the best performance, which was related with an enhancement of the amount of oxygen vacancies and the reducibility of NiO with respect to the other samples [23]. Moreover, the catalytic performance of Ni/ZrO2 in OSR of ethanol strongly depends on the preparation method of ZrO2 which determines the characteristics of the final catalyst [21]. In the case of Ni/Y2O3, the crystal size of Y2O3 affects the mobility of surface oxygen species which affects the catalytic performance of Ni/Y2O3 catalysts in the OSR of ethanol [17]. Assaf and col. studied the effect of Ni content (from 10 % to 15 %, wt/wt) on the steam-reforming of ethanol over Ni/YSZ catalysts [22]. They found that the increase in Ni content had a detrimental effect on the methane steam-reforming and water-gas shift reaction; both reactions contribute to the increase in H2 yield and decrease in by-products under conditions of steam-reforming of ethanol. The detrimental effect was attributed to the blocking of active nickel species which interact with the oxygen vacancies, the formation of nickel crystallites being the responsible for the blocking. This background and the lack of published papers on hydrogen production from n-propanol reforming processes led us to examine the behaviour of new Ni/Y2O3–ZrO2 catalysts in the OSR of n-propanol. For this purpose, besides Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Y2O3, we prepared and characterized Ni/Y2O3–ZrO2 catalysts with a Ni content of ca. 7% wt/wt and a wide range in the composition of the support (2–41 % Y2O3 wt/wt). The supports were prepared by a co-precipitation sol-gel method, and catalysts were used directly (calcined), without a previous reduction step, in the OSR of n-propanol. The performance of the catalysts is discussed on the basis of their characteristics."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Pure ZrO2 and Y2O3 oxides and Y2O3–ZrO2 oxides with different Y content (2, 5, 10, 16, 19, 29, 41% Y2O3 wt/wt) were prepared by a precipitation method based on that published for the preparation of pure Y2O3 with a high surface-area [25]. After precipitation, solids were dried and calcined at 873 K and then used as supports for the preparation of catalysts. Supports were labelled YxZr (x = Y2O3 % wt/wt). Ni was loaded (ca. 7% wt/wt) by wetness impregnation from an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2. The resulting solids were calcined at 723 K. Catalysts were named Ni/YxZr (x = Y2O3 % wt/wt) or Ni/Y2O3 and Ni/ZrO2 when pure Y2O3 and ZrO2 were used as supports."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The metal content of the samples was determined with an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Perkin Elmer Optima 3200RL apparatus. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K, on samples previously degassed at 473 K, using a Micromeritics ASAP9000 apparatus. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a computer controlled XPert-PRO diffractometer using the Cu Kα radiation with 0.017 steps in the range 2θ = 4–100° counting 50 s at each step. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed in a quartz tube reactor using a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 analyzer. Hydrogen consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In the analyses, 40–90 mg of the samples was placed in the reactor and reduced with a gas mixture of 12.5% v/v hydrogen in argon. The samples were heated at 10 K/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a PHI 5500 Multitechnique System, using a monochromatic AlKα X-ray source (1486.6 eV, 350 W) which was placed perpendicular to the analyzer, working with ultra-high vacuum within the range 2 × 10−8 and 5 × 10−9 torr. Spectra corresponding to Ni 2p, Y 3d and Zr 3d core levels were recorded and binding energies (BE) were referred to the C 1s peak, at 284.8 eV. The Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Jobin Yvon T-6400 in micro-Raman mode, at room temperature and a 500 mW laser beam. The spectra were collected using a 488 nm He–Ne laser with 5 mW power. The spectra were the result of 4 accumulations, each lasting 90 s. The samples were studied at various points at 50× magnification. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a HITACHI S-4100 instrument at 30 kV, equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector. For the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, the samples were dispersed in ethanol solutions and deposited on a 20-mesh Cu grid. TEM images were taken using a Phillips 301 microscope, working at 300 kV."
4,Oxidative steam reforming of n-propanol,"2.3 Oxidative steam reforming of n-propanol The OSR catalytic tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure using a conventional quartz “U” shaped (i.d. = 3 mm) fixed-bed reactor. Powdered catalysts (0.15 g) were used as prepared without previous reduction treatment. Before entering the reactor, the corresponding water/alcohol liquid mixture was vaporized and mixed with a preheated flow of inert (Ar) gas (Ar/reactant mixture = 4, molar ratio). The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV; volumetric flow rate of inlet gas/volume of catalyst bed) was 5000 h−1 and the steam/carbon molar ratio S/C = 3. The O2/n-propanol molar ratio was 0.5. The OSR was tested at 673 K (2 h), then at 723 K (2 h) and finally at 773 K (20 h). Products were analyzed on-line with a Varian STAR 3400CX gas chromatograph, equipped with a methanizer, TDC and FID detectors. n-Propanol conversion and product distribution are expressed in molar percentage."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Table 1 lists the catalysts prepared, as well as their Ni content, which was in the range 6.6–7.6 % wt/wt. Table 1 also shows the BET surface area of calcined catalysts which increased initially with the Y2O3 content of the support up to 10% Y2O3 wt/wt. Ni/YxZr catalysts with x ≥ 10 showed similar BET surface-area values. In all cases XRD patterns of calcined catalysts depict, besides the diffraction peaks assigned to the support, three peaks at 2θ = 37.24°, 43.27° and 62.85° (see in Fig. 1 XRD patterns of Ni/YxZr and Ni/ZrO2). The position of these peaks is that expected for the three most intense diffraction lines (111), (200), and (220) of the cubic NiO (JCPDS 01-078–0423). Using the (200) diffraction peak and the Scherrer equation, NiO crystallite sizes in the range 15–25 nm for fresh Ni/YxZr catalysts were estimated (see Table 1). As regards the diffraction peaks assigned to the support, the XRD pattern of Ni/Y2O3 showed peaks corresponding to cubic Y2O3 (JCPDS 01-083–0927). Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Y2Zr showed peaks assigned to monoclinic and tetragonal phases of ZrO2. Ni/YxZr (x > 2) catalysts showed diffraction peaks characteristic of tetragonal or cubic ZrO2; XRD cannot distinguish between the two phases. A closer examination of XRD patterns revealed a displacement of peaks at lower 2θ values as the Y2O3 content of the catalyst increases. This displacement is related with the formation of a Y2O3-ZrO2 solid solution because the Y3+ radius is higher than that of Zr4+. At this respect, Table 1 shows the position of the (101) ZrO2 peak, the most intense diffraction line of tetragonal/cubic ZrO2 phase. Fresh catalysts were also examined by HRTEM. In all cases, NiO and ZrO2 particles were identified by the FT-analysis of different zones. As an example, Fig. 2 A and B show representative high resolution micrographs of Ni/Y5Zr and Ni/Y16Zr catalysts, respectively. Well defined NiO particles exhibiting (111) lattice spacing were identified in both samples. XPS spectra were collected for fresh catalysts (calcined). In all cases Ni 2p, Y 3d and Zr 3d core levels were recorded. The BE of Zr 3d5/2 was 182.0 eV in Ni/ZrO2 and in the range 182.0–182.2 eV in Ni/YxZr. Fig. 3 shows the spectra of the Y 3d level. Spectra were not well resolved but most of them could be deconvoluted into two peaks, Y 3d5/2 and Y 3d3/2, with a ratio of intensity Y 3d5/2/Y 3d3/2 = 3/2 and a difference Y 3d5/2 BE- Y 3d3/2 BE = 2.1 eV, according to the presence of Y3+ in an oxide matrix. In all cases Y 3d5/2 BE values of Ni/YxZr (Y 3d5/2 = 158.1–159.3 eV) were lower than that corresponding to Ni/Y2O3 (Y 3d5/2 = 159.4 eV), which could be related with the formation of Y2O3-ZrO2 solid solutions [26]. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to Ni 2p level. The Ni 2p3/2 and and Ni 2p1/2 BE were centred at 853–854 eV and 871–872 eV, respectively. These values and the shakeup satellite peak at 860–861 eV, pointed to the presence of Ni2+. However, bands corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 level were broad and in some cases two components can be distinguished. This could be related with the presence of Ni2+ in different environment such as NiO or Ni2+ in direct interaction with the oxide support. From the XPS patterns, the Ni/Y+Zr surface atomic ratios of calcined catalysts were calculated and they were referred to Ni/Y+Zr atomic ratios determined by chemical analysis (ICP). The (Ni/Y+Zr)XPS/(Ni/Y+Zr)ICP ratio increases with the wt/wt % of Y2O3 content of the support (see Fig. 5 ). This points to a progressive segregation of Ni on the surface with the increase of Y2O3 content. Fig. 6 shows the Ni/Y ratios determined by XPS as a function of the Y2O3 content of the support. They showed a volcano plot, with a maximum around 20% wt/wt Y2O3. This trend contrasts with that of Ni/Y ratios determined by chemical analysis, which decreased continuously with the increase in Y2O3 content. A segregation of Y2O3 aggregates may take place above 20% wt/wt Y2O3. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied by TPR experiments. Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/YxZr catalysts showed hydrogen consumption in the range 523–773 K, but the H2 consumption was extended up to 950 K for Ni/Y2O3 (Fig. 7 ). The amount of hydrogen consumed for each catalyst appears in Table 1. Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/YxZr (x ≤ 19) catalysts consumed the expected amount for the reduction of NiO to Ni. However, the H2 consumption of Ni/Y29Zr, Ni/Y41Zr and Ni/Y2O3 was higher than that expected. This could be related with a partial reduction of the support. Previous studies on NiO reducibility in Ni/ZrO2 systems have shown peaks corresponding to the reduction of bulk NiO around 640 K and two more peaks at around 700 K and 790 K, which were ascribed to the reduction of NiOx interacting with the ZrO2 surface. This interaction is stronger for the NiOx responsible for the peak at 790 K [27].The TPR profile of Ni/ZrO2 in Fig. 7 shows H2 consumption from 530 K to 740 K. H2 consumption from 640 K to 740 K may have a similar origin to that discussed above, but part of the Ni2+ present in the Ni/ZrO2 prepared here was reduced at a much lower temperature. ZrO2 exhibits oxygen vacancies which may interact with the impregnated metal oxides, affecting their redox properties. The reduction peak below 640 K may be related with the reduction of NiO influenced by the oxygen vacancies. In all cases, the TPR profiles of Ni/YxZr samples showed that the ratio of NiO species reduced below 640 K is higher than in Ni/ZrO2. This is in accordance with the increase in the number of oxygen vacancies in YxZr samples with respect to ZrO2. However, an exhaustive analysis of TPR profiles of Ni/YxZr samples showed that they are difficult to compare. TPR profiles of Ni/Y2Zr, NiY5Zr and Ni/Y10Zr show two main peaks at ca. 541 K and 572 K, with relative peak areas increasing with Y content. Then, Ni/YxZr catalysts with a higher Y2O3 content (x > 10) showed H2 consumption peaks at slightly higher temperatures, which may be related with a decrease in the number of surface oxygen vacancies when the Y2O3 content increases. Ni/Y2O3 catalyst showed a very different reduction profile: H2 consumption took place between 500K and 950K. In this case a partial reduction of the Y2O3 support is inferred (see Table 1), which has been reported to occur for pure Y2O3 at 923 K [17]. As stated above, Ni/Y29Zr and Ni/Y41Zr also show higher H2 consumption than is theoretically necessary for NiO reduction (Table 1). We also attribute this to the reduction of Y3+ species, which may form small Y2O3 aggregates in the Y2O3-ZrO2 solid solution. These small aggregates would be reduced at lower temperature than bulk Y2O3."
7,Catalytic behaviour and post-reaction catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalytic behaviour and post-reaction catalyst characterization As stated in the experimental section, calcined catalysts were tested directly, without previous reduction, in the OSR of n-propanol at increasing temperatures: 673 K (2 h), 723 K (2 h) and 773 K (20 h) at GHSV of 5000 h−1. Most of the catalysts showed n-propanol conversion less than 100% at 673 K. However, at 723 K and 773 K all catalysts showed total n-propanol conversion. In all cases the main products obtained were H2 and CO2 corresponding to the oxidative reformation of n-propanol but variable amounts of CO and CH4 were also produced. In addition, in some cases, 3-pentanone, propylene and acetone were detected at 673 K, usually when n-propanol conversion was less than 100%. Then, when the temperature was increased to 723 K the amount of these by-products decreased or was null. This is illustrated in Fig. 8 which shows the catalytic behaviour of Ni/Y5Zr. Separate catalytic experiments over Ni/Y5Zr were carried out under different GHSV at 723 K (see Fig. 9 ). A decrease in n-propanol conversion was accompanied by a slight decline in the molar concentration of H2 and by a rise in the molar concentration of by-products. At 15000 h−1, the n-propanol conversion was ca. 50% and the concentration of by-products was ca. 12% mol/mol. Under these conditions mainly propylene, propanal and ethylene, which are usually related to coke precursors, were formed as by-products. The behaviour of all catalysts at 773 K and GHSV = 5000 h−1 after 24 h of reaction is shown in Fig. 10 . As stated above, in all cases, n-propanol was totally converted under these conditions. There were no strong differences in the behaviour as a function of the Y2O3 content of the support. However, for Ni/YxZr catalysts, the H2 concentration in the outlet gas increased with the increase in Y2O3 content up to Ni/Y19Zr, and then decreased slightly for x > 19. The Ni/YXPS ratio followed a similar trend (see Fig. 6). Ni/Y19Zr showed the highest Ni/YXPS ratio, and the presence of Y2O3 aggregates is proposed in Ni/YxZr catalysts with x > 19. Both Ni dispersion and the oxygen mobility influence the catalytic behaviour of these materials in the OSR of n-propanol. Catalysts were characterized after the catalytic tests by XRD, SEM-EDX and Raman spectroscopy. In all cases XRD patterns of the used catalysts showed, besides the peaks corresponding to the support, those characteristic of Ni°. As an example, in Fig. 11 , the XRD pattern of Ni/Y19Zr post-reaction catalyst is compared with those of fresh catalyst and of the Y19Zr support. The absence of NiO peaks in the XRD pattern of the used catalyst indicates the reduction of NiO during the catalytic test, giving rise to the formation of Ni° particles. A similar behaviour has been reported for cobalt-based catalysts during ethanol steam-reforming [28]. The characterization by SEM-EDX of used-catalysts showed, in all cases, the presence of carbon deposits. For a better characterization of the carbon deposits, post-reaction samples were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 12 shows the Raman spectra between 1200 and 1700 cm−1. Two characteristic bands of carbon deposits at approximately 1350 cm−1 (D) and 1590 cm−1 (G) are clearly visible in the spectra. The D band is ascribed to the structural imperfection of graphite, and the G band corresponds to the in-plane carbon–carbon stretching vibrations (E 2g) of the graphite layers; this band is narrower and located at lower wavenumbers (ca. 1582 cm−1) when ordered graphitic deposits are present [29,30]. The post-reaction catalysts examined here showed wide D and G bands with similar intensity, this indicates the formation of poorly ordered carbon deposits."
8,Conclusions,"Oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of n-propanol can be effectively carried out at 773 K over Ni catalysts supported on Y2O3-ZrO2 (2–41 % Y2O3 wt/wt), using n-propanol/water/O2 at a molar ratio of 1/9/0.5. Besides H2 and CO2, only CH4 and CO were obtained as by-products. Both Ni dispersion and support oxygen vacancies influence the catalytic behaviour of Ni/Y2O3-ZrO2 in the OSR of n-propanol. The highest H2 production was found for the Ni/Y19Zr catalyst, which also showed the highest Ni/YXPS atomic ratio. Characterization of post-reaction catalysts showed that initial NiO transforms to Ni° during the catalytic test and poorly ordered carbon deposits were formed."
