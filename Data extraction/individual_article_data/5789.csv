0,Introduction,"Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have attracted more interest and rapidly developed due to their high efficiency and fast reaction rates relative to biological processes [1,2]. Among various AOPs, Fenton and Fenton-like processes have been demonstrated to be green and sustainable in wastewater treatment [3,4]. Metal ions/oxides are widely used for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation to form radical species for the degradation of organic pollutants [5,6]. However, two serious issues of the current H2O2-AOPs processes limit its practical use, including the limited reaction pH conditions (pH 2–4) and the catalysts precipitation, which would cause secondary pollution and catalysts loss. For overcoming the above issues, several hopeful routes with an enhancement of the efficiency of H2O2-AOPs processes were proposed: (ⅰ) to minimize the catalyst loss and secondary pollution, anchoring of transition metals catalysts on different supports have been developed [7,8]. (ⅱ) Chelates formed by citric acid or oxalic acid with metal ions were used to prevent the catalyst precipitation, widening the pH value for reaction to neutral and alkaline conditions [9]. However, the solution pH may not maintain constant and decrease gradually during these procedures, resulting in catalyst precipitation and deactivation. Recently, bicarbonate/H2O2 (BAP), as a green and simple system, has been applied for the degradation of organic pollutants due to the pH-buffering capacity under pH 6–9 and limited catalyst precipitation. The incorporation of metal ions (Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+ etc.) into the BAP system can dramatically increase pollutants degradation rate. Among the catalysts for BAP, Co-based catalysts were found to exhibit appealing ability for pollutant degradation. Then, considering the immobilization of the catalyst and minimization of the catalyst loss, various cobalt-containing recyclable heterogeneous catalysts over different supports have been developed for organic pollutants removal. For example, Yin prepared Co-based heterogeneous catalysts over diatomite [10] or layered double hydrotalcite [11], effectively preventing Co ion leaching for contaminants degradation. Alternatively, N-doped carbonaceous materials as supports showed high catalytic activity due to the adjustable electronic distribution [12]. Duan et al., prepared a CoxOy catalyst supported on granular activated carbon from the Co-phenanthroline complex and successfully applied in the BAP system for azo dyes degradation [13]. Zhong et al., adopted chitosan as support to prepare catalysts confining cobalt oxides on N-doped carbonaceous materials, exhibiting good catalytic activity [14]. However, it is still a long-term goal to develop a heterogeneous catalyst with excellent catalytic performance and stability against the leaching of metal ions. Among the different N-doped carbonaceous materials, cobalt encapsulated into N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@NC), had shown to be a promising catalyst to improve the catalytic activity [15]. Wu et al., prepared a cobalt-based heterogeneous catalyst by adopting N-doped carbon nanotubes as support, demonstrating excellent property and reusability for sulfite activation in the degradation of organic pollutants [16]. However, the role of nitrogen and carbon elements on the activity of the catalyst is still not well understood. Moreover, until now there has been no study for the performance of Co@NC in the BAP system. Herein, we prepared Co@NC catalysts through a pyrolysis procedure, followed by acid treatment to remove excess metallic Co and decrease the Co2+ leaching, and evaluated their catalytic activity for acid orange 7 (AO7) removal in the BAP system. AO7 removal by cobalt hydroxide, ultrasound and ultraviolet radiation in the BAP system has been reported [17,18], but this is the first report on the study of Co@NC catalyst applied in the BAP system for the dye degradation. The synthesized material was characterized by several techniques to investigate the relationship between catalyst structure and performance. The effect of pH, catalyst concentration, HCO3 - concentration on the removal efficiency of AO7 was investigated too. The activation mechanism and the contributions of Co, C and N elements on the catalyst performance were further explored and discussed. The reusability of the catalyst was also determined."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Co@NC catalyst,"2.1 Preparation of Co@NC catalyst Co@NC catalysts were prepared by a simple pyrolysis procedure [15]. Typically, 10 g melamine (MA), 0.5 g Co(OAC)2 and 20 mL deionized water were mixed and stirred for 30 min. The reaction mixture was dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain a pink solid. Then, the solid was pyrolyzed at 700 °C under N2 atmosphere for 2 h in a furnace. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained product was grounded to powders in a mortar. The resulted powders were further treated with 0.5 M HNO3 by stirring 24 h to remove any soluble materials, including the cobalt species outside the carbon nanotubes, and then washed away the residue HNO3 by deionized water. For comparison, the NC catalyst was prepared by the same method but without Co salt. Co3O4 was prepared by calcination of Co(OAC)2 at 500 °C for 2 h."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization The structure and performances of the prepared Co@NC were characterized by XRD, Raman, TEM, SEM, BET, XPS, and EPR, respectively. Detailed instrument modes and measurement conditions can be found in Supplementary information Ⅰ."
4,AO7 degradation experiment,"2.3 AO7 degradation experiment The AO7 degradation experiments were conducted at room temperature. The fixed amount of Co@NC, AO7 and NaHCO3 was put into the reactor, then the reaction was started by adding H2O2. During the reaction, the solution was taken out at set intervals. After removing the catalyst by filtration, the samples were monitored right away at 484 nm on a UV–Vis spectrophotometer. To measure the catalyst reusability, the catalyst stayed the same through the recycling experiments, the next reaction was initiated by adding a fresh mixture of AO7, H2O2 and NaHCO3. For analyzing the effect of solution pH, the initial pH was regulated with 0.2 MH2SO4 or NaOH. To detect active radical species, radical scavenging measurements such as ethanol (EtOH), benzoquinone (BQ) and NaN3 were carried out. Nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) probing technology was also applied. The data of cobalt ions release was obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of Co@NC,"3.1 Characterization of Co@NC The XRD pattern of Co@NC catalyst was displayed in Fig. 1a. A sharp diffraction peak at a value of 26.4° was observed, which could be identified as the (002) plane of hexagonal graphitic carbon [19]. The other three sharp diﬀraction peaks at 44.2°, 51.3° and 75.9° could be attributed to (111), (200), (220) crystal faces of cubic metallic Co (JCPDS 15–0806) [20], respectively. The results confirmed the formation of graphitic carbon and the metallic Co during the pyrolysis process at 700 °C [16,21]. To further get the disordered degree and crystallinity of graphitic carbon structure, the Raman spectrum was displayed in Fig. 1b, in which the D band (1357 cm−1) and G band (1587 cm−1) were recorded [22]. The ID/IG ratio of 1.01 indicated the presence of abundant structural defects in the graphitic carbon. The enriched defects may act as active sites for the adsorption of contaminants and H2O2 in the BAP system. In addition, a low-intensity band located at 685 cm−1 could be ascribed to oxidized cobalt species [23], indicating that a small fraction of Co was oxidized to CoO. As shown in Fig. 1c, the N2 sorption isotherms of the Co@NC presents a typical type-IV isotherm. The H3-type hysteresis loop can be seen within 0.2–0.9 of P/P0, indicating the mesoporous structures of Co@NC. The pore diameter distributions determined by the BJH method (Fig. 1d) showed that the pore diameters are mainly focused within the range of 2.0–4.2 nm. The BET surface area of Co@NC is 320.15 m2/g, which is favorable to catalytic performance. The SEM images in Fig. 2(a, b) present a hollow carbon nanotube structure with different lengths. As shown in Fig. 2d, the TEM image reveals that the cobalt nanoparticles (dark dots) with a diameter of 10–25 nm are uniformly encapsulated in the hollow carbon nanotubes and rarely aggregated. The HR-TEM image focusing on a single nanoparticle, as shown in Fig. 2e, reveals that the Co nanoparticle is surrounded by a carbon shell with a thickness of about 5.2 nm. Such a structure may facilitate catalytic performance due to fast electron transport between Co nanoparticle and the outer carbon layer [24]. In addition, The TEM image shown in Fig. 2f presents lattices with a 0.204 nm width, which corresponds to the Co (111) crystal plane, further suggesting the reduction of Co oxides to metallic Co species upon the pyrolysis process. From the above results, it can be concluded that the N-doped graphitic carbon nanotube structure with metallic Co nanoparticles embedded is formed upon the pyrolysis process. As reported in previous works, for the pyrolysis procedure without Co(OAc)2, only an amorphous carbon structure can be formed and the catalytic performance is poor. Co nanoparticles are necessary for catalyzing graphitization and the growth of nanotubes [16,25]. EDS analysis indicates that the Co@NC consists of four elements, C, Co, O and N (Fig. 2c). Their contents were evaluated to 86.58%, 3.48%, 6.15% and 3.78 (at%), respectively. The elemental mapping was measured and is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that element distributions match well with the N-doped carbon nanotube structure with Co nanoparticles encapsulated."
7,Catalytic performance evaluation,"3.2 Catalytic performance evaluation The catalytic performance of Co@NC was measured in bicarbonate buﬀer solution. As shown in Fig. 4a, for the BAP system without the addition of Co@NC, only about 11.6% of AO7 degradation is achieved after 30 min, indicating that H2O2+HCO3 - can not directly degrade AO7. For the Co@NC+H2O2 system without HCO3 -, AO7 degradation achieves only about 11.8% after 30 min, indicating that the activation of H2O2 by Co@NC is feeble and degradation by the adsorption activity of Co@NC is very limited. Similarly, for the system containing only Co@NC and NaHCO3, the degradation of AO7 is 22%, which may be attributed to the adsorption activity of Co@NC. These results indicate that the AO7 removal is very limited by adsorption on Co@NC and the binary systems of Co@NC+HCO3 -, Co@NC+H2O2 and HCO3 -+H2O2 are incapable of degrading AO7 individually. Interestingly, with the simultaneous presence of Co@NC, HCO3 - and H2O2, the removal of AO7 reaches 96.4% after 40 min; When using Na2CO3 instead of NaHCO3, the removal of AO7 did not reach 30%. These results indicate that Co@NC, H2O2 and HCO3 - are all necessary for AO7 removal in the BAP system. As reported in our previous work, Cu, Fe or Mn-encapsulated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes were prepared by our group and their catalytic performances were evaluated to be far lower than that of Co@NC in the sulfite activation for MO degradation [16]. Therefore, Co species in the Co@NC play the main role in H2O2 activation. Indeed, when NC without Co species was used as the catalyst, little degradation of the dye was observed. The performance of the Fe2+/H2O2 system for AO7 degradation under different Fe2+ concentrations and solution pH was carried out. In Fig. S1, it was found that for the Fe2+/H2O2 system with a Fe2+ concentration of 5 μM, only about 40% of the dye was removed after 40 min, which was much lower than that with Co@NC+HCO3 -/H2O2 system. At a higher Fe2+ concentration of 50 μM, a faster degradation rate was observed; but when HCO3 - was added into the system, nearly ne degradation occurred, implying the limitation of Fenton oxidation. In addition, the Co3O4+HCO3 -/H2O2 system also showed a lower performance, compared with the Co@NC+HCO3 -/H2O2 system. UV–vis spectra changes with time during AO7 degradation in the Co@NC+BAP system were displayed in Fig. 4b. The absorption band at 484 nm (p–p* transition of the azo) decreases with time rapidly and almost disappears completely within 30 min, demonstrating that the chromophoric structure in the vicinity of the azo-linkage is destructed. Meanwhile, the band at 230 nm and 310 nm, belonging to the π–π* transition of the benzoic and naphthalene ring, show the same trend with the band at 484 nm, indicating the opening of the benzene and naphthalene ring, respectively [26]. Mineralization degree was tested for the process. The TOC removal is only 15%, suggesting the difficulty of complete mineralization of final products produced by AO7 degradation to CO2 and CO in the reaction system. The eﬀect of initial pH of the solution on the AO7 removal was studied in the Co@NC+H2O2+HCO3 - system. As shown in Fig. 5a, with the increase of pH from 6.1 to 10.0, the AO7 degradation rate first increases and then decreases. The removal of AO7 reaches the maximum value of 95% at pH 7.3 after 25 min. While further increasing pH from 9.0 to 10.0, the removal of AO7 began to decrease sharply from 70% to 31%. The results show that the catalyst exhibits the best catalytic activity under initial solution pH of 7.3–8.3. In the BAP system, singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anion radical (O2 -•), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) could be formed [27]. Guo et al. reported that excellent catalytic performance could be achieved under the weak alkaline conditions in the BAP system [28]. Higher pH is favorable for O2 -• generation, while not be beneficial for the generation of 1O2 [29]. So it is necessary to retain a suitable pH condition for the system. The solution pH was monitored during the degradation process under initial solution pH of 8.3. After the reaction, the solution pH remains unchanged nearly, which may be due to the high content of HCO3 - as the buffer. Then the effect of HCO3 - concentration on AO7 removal was measured. As depicted in Fig. 5b, upon increasing HCO3 - concentration to 15 mM, the degradation rate initially increases and then decreases. The degradation rate reaches the maximum at 10 mM. Even at a lower concentration of 2.5 mM, a higher degradation rate still can be reached. As literature discussed before, HCO3 - is a good complexing agent and brings multifunctions for organic pollutants degradation catalyzed by Co-based catalysts in BAP system, including participating in the generation of Co-complex and active radical HCO4 -, providing pH buffer to stabilize the reactions, combining with •OH to generate the long lifetime radical (CO3 •-) [13,30]. The initial increase of AO7 removal may be due to the amounts of HCO3 - complexed to Co species increase and effectively promote the reaction. However, excess HCO3 - would decrease the dye degradation rate due to the quenching of •OH by HCO3 - [31]. Therefore, 5–10 mM HCO3 - is the appropriate amount for the catalyst system. The effect of the H2O2 and Co@NC concentration on the AO7 removal was investigated too. As shown in Fig. 5c, with the Co@NC concentration fixed, upon increasing the H2O2 concentration from 5 mM to 20 mM, the AO7 degradation rate increases from 74% to 96.4% within 40 min. When further increasing the concentration of H2O2 to 40 mM, the AO7 degradation rate reaches 93.9% within 25 min, The results show that the higher H2O2 concentration, the higher AO7 removal. Considering the removal rate of AO7, 20 mM H2O2 was fixed in the following experiment to study the effect of Co@NC concentration. As displayed in Fig. 5d, almost no AO7 degradation occurs without a catalyst. While the reduction of AO7 reaches 93.5% after 30 min with only 0.1 g/L catalyst, and quickly reaches 96.6% after 10 min upon increasing the concentration of catalyst to 1.0 g/L."
8,Reusability of Co@NC,"3.3 Reusability of Co@NC To measure the reusability of the Co@NC catalyst, the catalyst was recycled by filtration after the experiments, the next degradation reaction was initiated by adding a fresh mixture of AO7 and H2O2. As displayed in Fig. 6a, the catalytic activity shows a gradual decrease during three rounds. After the third round, the removal of AO7 only reaches 40%. The formed intermediates during the reaction would deposit on the surface of the catalyst and occupy the active sites, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst and descend of catalytic performance in the next round [16,32]. Also, the oxidation of Co(0) to Co oxides occurred during the reaction, which will also decrease the catalytic performance of the catalyst. However, when the catalyst was heated in N2 atmosphere at 400 °C for 1 h after the third run, the catalytic performance was fully recovered. Degradation of AO7 achieves almost 96% within 15 min, which is even better than the first use. The fact was probably caused by the removal of adsorbed intermediate products and the reduction of Co oxides. After each reaction, cobalt ion leaching is less than 0.05 mg/L, which is lower than those of recently reported Co-based catalyst adopted N-doped carbonaceous materials (0.1–0.42 mg/L) [16,33], and far lower than the 1 mg/L limit formulated by the Chinese National Standard (GB 13456-2012 and 25467-2010), indicating the high stability of Co@NC against cobalt ion leaching. Moreover, the content of Co in the fresh and used catalyst after the fourth run was analyzed by AAS. It was found that the value for the fresh catalyst was 17.3 wt%, slightly higher than that obtained with EDS (14.7 wt%). After the reaction, there was nearly no decrease of the content (17.0 wt%). In addition, the XRD pattern (Fig. 6b) of the used Co@NC after four recycles also reveals that its crystal structure remains unchanged. The high stability of Co@NC against cobalt ion leaching may be attributed to the interaction between cobalt and nitrogen as discussed in XPS results below and the protection of the carbon nanotubes."
9,Reaction mechanism investigation,"3.4 Reaction mechanism investigation In the BAP system, not only •OH can be generated by H2O2, but also superoxide species, O2 -• can be generated by reduction of cobalt with high oxidation states. EtOH as •OH radicals inhibitors was added to find the main active radicals during the degradation reaction. As shown in Fig. 7a, the catalytic performance increases with the increase of amounts of EtOH from 1 mL to 5 mL, which implies that •OH may not be major reactive oxygen species in the reaction for the AO7 removal and the introduction of EtOH may change major reactive oxygen species in the reaction for the AO7 removal. This phenomenon was also reported by Richardson and his co-workers. More than half of HCO3 - are transformed to HCO4 -, resulting in the increase of catalytic efficiency of the BAP system by using more primary alcohols [34,35]. BQ was added to the system to study the role of O2 -• [36]. The higher of the BQ concentration, the lower rate for AO7 degradation. Upon increasing the concentration of BQ from 0.005 g/ L to 0.01 g/ L, the degradation rate of AO7 after 30 min decreases from 83% to 58%. The results demonstrate that the O2 -• radicals contribute to the degradation of AO7. O2 -• can also be determined by NBT. The characteristic absorbance at 530 nm demonstrates the formation of diformazan, which is the product of NBT reacting with O2 -• [37]. As shown in Fig. 7b, the characteristic absorbance increases with the reaction time, further indicating that O2 -• radicals are generated in the system during the degradation process. The AO7 degradation was not inhibited completely by BQ, indicating the existence of other reactive oxygen species. Recently, 1O2 has also been indicated as a reactive species for organic pollutants degradation [38]. Hence, a quenching agent, NaN3, was further applied to identify the contribution of 1O2 [39]. As shown in Fig. 7a, The AO7 degradation is significantly impressed in the presence of NaN3 within the 20 min, implying that 1O2 also contributes to the AO7 degradation. However, the AO7 degradation rate still reaches 91% after 40 min, implying that O2 -• may contribute to the degradation of AO7 after 1O2 species are quenched. According to the literature, HCO4 -, formed through the equilibrium between H2O2 and HCO3 - (Eq. (8)), can generate a series of radicals by homolysis of the O-O bond, such as 1O2, HO2 •, O2 -• and CO3 •- [30]. However, the generation of the HCO4 - requires a large amount of H2O2 and HCO3 -. In the study, the very few HCO4 - can be formed with the presence of H2O2 (20 mM) and HCO3 −(5 mM) [40], implying the generation of 1O2 by HCO4 - can be negligible in the study. Moreover, non-radical pathway by HCO4 - in BAP system was once reported in BAP system [18]. Similarly, owing to the very few HCO4 - as discussed above, non-radical pathway by HCO4 - can be negligible in the study. As stated above, in the experiment for the BAP system without Co@NC, only 11.6% AO7 removal was achieved after 30 min, indicating that H2O2+HCO3 - can not directly degrade AO7. HCO3 - is an efficient scavenger of •OH radicals accompanied by the formation of CO3 -•, which participates in the formation of O2 -• and 1O2 [30]. Therefore, 1O2 may mainly be generated by carbonate radicals (CO3 •-) and O2 -• as shown in Eqs. (1)–(7) [18,41]. Consequently, it can be deduced that O2 -• and 1O2 play an important role in AO7 degradation in the Co@NC+HCO3 -+H2O2 system. (1) ⋅ O H + H C O 3 − → C O 3 • − + H 2 O (2) C O 3 • − + H 2 O 2 → H C O 3 − + H O 2 • (3) H O 2 • → H + + O 2 − • (4) H O 2 • + ⋅ O H → O 2 − • + H 2 O (5) O 2 − • + ⋅ O H → O 2 1 + O H − (6) H O 2 • + O 2 − • → O 2 1 + H O 2 − (7) H O 2 • + H O 2 • → O 2 1 + H 2 O 2 (8) H C O 3 − + H 2 O 2 → H C O 4 − + H 2 O To further explore the role of N, C, Co, O on H2O2 activation process, the XPS spectra of Co@NC were conducted and the relative proportion of chemical species in the XPS spectra before and after the reaction were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 8a, the C 1s spectrum is fitted into three peaks, 284.8, 285.8 and 290.15 eV, which are corresponded to C-C, C-OH, carbonyl C-O respectively [42]. It can be seen that the contents of the above three peaks show nearly no changes during the reaction, demonstrating the C element is not an active component in the degradation reaction. In addition, the hollow structure of carbon nanotubes can prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles and the leaching of Co ions. As shown in Fig. 8b, five peaks at 398.3, 399.0, 399.8, 401.2 and 404.3 eV are identified as pyridinic-N, Co-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N and oxidized N, respectively [43]. Pyridinic and pyrrolic-N are formed at the defect sites in the carbon framework. Co-N at 399.0 eV would also benefit for preventing the leaching of Co ions [44,45]. In this study, it can be observed that pyridinic-N proportion decreases from 15.3% to 8.6%, graphitic N decreases from 42.6% to 38.7%, and pyrrolic-N proportion increases from 19.9% to 30.4%, implying the reconstruction of N configuration during the reaction. As reported in our previous study, the catalytic performance of Co@NC is slightly higher than that of metallic cobalt, suggesting that a synergistic effect exists between the Co nanoparticles and N-doped nanotube [16]. The change of the pyridinic-N and graphitic N during the reaction suggests that they take part in the reaction of H2O2 activation. A similar phenomenon has also been observed that pyridinic-N participated in PMS activation [46]. Ma reported that N atoms in carbon nanotubes can induce the non-radical pathway for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation with the generation of 1O2 [47]. And Gao reported that nitrogen dopants would change the electron density distribution between nitrogen and carbon atoms, hence activating the adjacent carbons and facilitating the catalytic performance [39]. Fig. 8c shows the XPS spectra change of Co 2p during the reaction. The two peaks at 778.96 and 780.88 eV of Co@NC before reaction corresponds to Co(0) and Co-O/Co-N/Co-C, respectively [48,49]. The satellite peak at 786.98 eV is the characteristic of the Co(II) [50]. During the reaction, the peak area of Co(0) weakens from 48.8% to 22.9%, while the peak area of cobalt(III) increases to 16.4%, suggesting that metallic Co nanoparticles are converted to oxidized cobalt, Co (II+III). Furthermore, as displayed in Fig. 8d, the increase of the area of lattice O during the reaction may be attributed to the oxidation of Co species. Based on the above discussion, a possible H2O2 activation mechanism by Co@NC catalyst in the BAP system was drawn in Scheme 1: First, H2O2 and HCO3 - are adsorbed in the surface of the Co@NC catalyst. Then electron transfer occurs among Co(0), H2O2 and HCO3 - with the generation of •OH [13,31]. The •OH radicals would react with HCO3 - to form CO3 -•, which may act in such a way as Eqs. (1)–(7) in the AO7 degradation process [18,41]. CO3 -• may directly take part in the formation of 1O2 and hence contributes to the degradation of AO7 [51,52]. The Co(III) can be reduced to Co(II) by H2O2 accompanied with the production of O2 -• radicals, which play a contribution on AO7 degradation as we discussed above."
10,Conclusion,"In our study, a Co@NC catalyst was successfully prepared by pyrolysis of Co salt and melamine, followed by acid treatment. The prepared Co@NC demonstrates the high catalytic performance in BAP system for AO7 removal under neutral or weak alkaline conditions. Meanwhile, high stability against cobalt ions leaching was observed and Co@NC can be recovered by thermal treatment. The mechanism analysis suggests that O2 -• radicals and 1O2 may be the dominant reactive species to degrade AO7 from H2O2 decomposition under the synergistic effect between Co and pyridinic-N/graphitic N. The excellent catalytic performance and high stability of Co@NC catalysts in the BAP system present new insights in catalyst design for organic pollutants removal in wastewater treatment."
