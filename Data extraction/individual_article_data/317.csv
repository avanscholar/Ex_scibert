0,Introduction,"Consumerism, environmental regulations, and the high cost of raw material and conventional processes are inducing the petrochemical industries to find new multipurpose routes for the production of chemicals and energy carriers. Hydrogen and ethylene are important industrial products [1–4]. Hence, the investigation of new conversion methods for simultaneous ethylene and hydrogen production is of great commercial interest. Furthermore, owing to the importance of carbon capture and use, the utilization of carbon dioxide in the conversion of industrial streams would also reduce the inevitable aftereffects of its release to the atmosphere. Accordingly, the carbon-dioxide-assisted conversion of light hydrocarbons is currently state of the art [5–7]. Ethylene, i.e. the lightest olefin, is one of the most important commodities in the petrochemical industry. The major application of ethylene is in the production of chemicals and building blocks such as polyethylene, polyesters, polyvinyl chloride, ethylbenzene, oxirane, and ethylene glycol. However, it has wide applications in the regulation of plants growing, food ripening, welding, anti-freezing, and the production of mustard gas and detergents [8–16]. Ethylene is conventionally manufactured by cracking or catalytic dehydrogenation of light to heavy hydrocarbons (i.e., ethane, LPG, naphtha, and gas oils) [17–22]. The production of ethylene under such circumstances causes a number of disadvantages and restrictions such as thermodynamic limitations, high coke yield, short run length, large pressure drop, severe catalyst deactivation, low product yield, and very high energy consumption [23–25]. Consequently, there is a compelling need for the development of an alternative and cost-effective process. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) appears as a potential efficient process owing to a number of advantages including lower operating temperatures, higher ethylene yield, lower coke yield, and elimination of the equilibrium limitations [19,26–32]. Over the years, various oxidizing agents including dry air [33], oxygen [34–37], nitrous oxide [34,36,38], sulfur dioxide [15,36], and carbon dioxide [36,39] have been proposed. Of particular interest is the carbon-dioxide-assisted conversion of ethane, because it is a milder oxidant than oxygen and is also less hazardous than nitrous oxide and sulfur oxide [6,40,41]. Uncontrolled oxidation of ethane in the presence of oxygen might result in large hydrogen and carbon dioxide production with very low ethylene yield [42–44]. In addition, the presence of carbon dioxide in the product stream imposes extra charges of separation, capture, and storage facilities [45]. Accordingly, the utilization of mild oxidants is of great attention. High heat capacity, high product yield, and low energy consumption are the advantages of carbon dioxide utilization for the oxidation of alkanes [6,40,46–48]. Elimination of carbon dioxide as an abundant greenhouse gas through a chemical conversion could also be beneficial [5,6]. Furthermore, hydrogen is a major product of the carbon-dioxide-assisted conversion of ethane to ethylene. Hydrogen is known as a promising alternative for future energy delivery owing to high energy density. Indeed, it possesses the highest energy density in comparison with conventional energy carriers [4]. Moreover, carbon-neutral ignition, the possibility of direct ignition in the developed internal combustion engines, the possibility of blending with alcohols, large effective octane number, and clean combustion are the major benefits connected to the utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier [4]. In addition to the energy delivery, hydrogen is widely utilized in the refinery and petrochemical units for processes such as hydrotreating, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, gas to liquid (GTL) technology, acetylene hydrogenation, synthesis of ammonia, alcohols (methanol and ethanol), and dimethyl ether, and bio-oil upgrading [4,49–53]. Fossil hydrocarbon compounds such as natural gas constituents are the major sources for hydrogen production [54]. It is formed as a major by-product of carbon-dioxide-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Accordingly, the simultaneous production of ethylene and hydrogen from ethane is currently state of the art. In order to facilitate the reaction at low temperatures, reduce side reactions, and efficiently enhance the transformation of ethane into ethylene in the carbon-dioxide-assisted ODH, a number of selective catalytic species and supports have been studied. Li et al. [55] investigated the catalytic activity of Co(3%)/MCM-41 in the ODH of ethane by utilizing carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity were found to be 40 % and 99 %, respectively. Liu et al. [40] utilized Cr-based mesoporous materials. They reported ethane conversion of 58.0–68.1 %, combined with an ethylene yield of 53.4–55.6 %. Michorczyk et al. [46] investigated the catalytic activity of pure SBA-1 and Cr-containing SBA-1 material in the carbon-dioxide-assisted ODH of propane. In a further study [56], the effects of support type and Cr content were also examined. Baidya et al. [57] synthesized the Ca-doped ThO2 catalyst by solution combustion method and tested for the ODH of ethane with carbon dioxide. Cheng et al. [58] demonstrated high activity and stability of Cr/ZSM-5 catalysts at 500−650 °C. They observed 65 % and 49 % for ethane conversion and ethylene yield, respectively. Talati et al. [47] synthesized Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/TiO2 nanocatalysts by coprecipitation and impregnation techniques. They evaluated the catalytic performance in ODH of ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide, concluding that the catalyst preparation method affects the ethane conversion and ethylene yield. Rahmani and coworkers [14,59] studied the catalytic behavior in the ODH of ethane with carbon dioxide over Cr catalysts promoted by Ce. It was observed that Ce could remarkably enhance the catalytic performance. Optimized textural properties, less agglomeration, uniform dispersion of catalytic species, and better catalyst reduction were reported as the reasons for such achievements. In addition, they promoted the performance of Cr catalyst by the combination of H-ZSM-5 and ZrO2 supports. More recently, Koirala and co-workers [60] demonstrated the effect of Co content on SiO2 support in the conversion of ethane with carbon dioxide. They reported that different loading of Co has a significant effect on the structural and catalytic characteristics of catalyst particles. The highest ethylene yield was obtained in the catalyst sample containing 0.75 wt.% Co, which was about 39 %. Up to now, Al2O3 [61–64], SiO2 [65], MgO [66], TiO2 [67], ZrO2 [58], TS-1 [58], and zeolites [13,68,69] have been investigated as the catalyst supports and, among them, Al2O3 is the most commonly utilized. High surface area, better dispersion of metal oxide species, and higher temperature of reduction are the characteristics of Al2O3-supported catalysts [11,61,70,71]. Noteworthy, none of the previous studies focused on the efficiency of hydrogen production through the ODH of ethane. Among metal oxides, Co and Mo oxides were found to be very active and selective for the carbon-dioxide-assisted ODH of ethane [71–77]. Hence, the investigation of commercial alumina-supported Co-Mo catalysts for the conversion of ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide is currently state of the art. Nevertheless, as mentioned previously, the previous studies did not focus on the efficiency of hydrogen production through this process. Hence, the current study is devoted to investigating the performance of two alumina-supported Co-Mo catalysts for the conversion of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen in the presence of carbon dioxide. As far as the authors know, this is the first study considering the efficiency of hydrogen production in the carbon-dioxide-assisted ODH of ethane to ethylene. Thus, the effects of reaction temperature and reactant to catalyst ratio on the conversions of the reactants, as well as the efficiencies of desired products, i.e. ethylene and hydrogen, are experimentally investigated. The results of the present contribution could be beneficial in the development of a multipurpose process for ethylene and hydrogen production from ethane and carbon dioxide and further understanding of the impact of alumina-supported Co-Mo catalysts on this process. The utilization of commercially-developed catalysts might pave a reliable path to the commercialization of the process."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The utilized catalysts are supplied from American Cyanamid (HDS 16A, 4.4 wt.% cobalt and 7.5 wt.% molybdenum) and Criterion (DC 130 KHT, 3.4 wt.% cobalt and 13.6 wt.% molybdenum). The utilized gases and their purities are ethane (99.9 %), carbon dioxide (99.99 %), and argon (99.999 %)."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts Both catalysts were characterized to study their oxidation states and textural properties. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts were determined via a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer employing monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Data were extracted with a scanning angle (2θ) of 5−90° with 0.05° step size. The temperature-programmed reduction in the presence of hydrogen (H2-TPR) was employed to determine the reduction states, as well as the metallic sites, of the catalysts. H2-TPR spectra were extracted by employing a NanoSORD NS91 (Sensiran). A typical procedure includes sample weighting (0.05 g), locating in a U-shaped reactor, heating under helium atmosphere (10 mL/min, up to 300 °C), degassing and evacuation, cooling to ambient temperature, and heating under hydrogen-diluted argon (5% H2 balance with Ar) atmosphere (10 °C/min, up to 900 °C). A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was then employed to analyze the output stream. The textural properties of catalysts were determined via nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K. The adsorption/desorption measurements were conducted in the p/p0 range of 0.009−0.98 by utilizing a Micromeritics analyzer apparatus (ASAP-2020) in static mode. Prior to measurements, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 573 K for more than 1 h. The textural properties of samples (i.e., surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution) were determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analysis."
4,Catalytic conversion of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen with carbon dioxide,"2.3 Catalytic conversion of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen with carbon dioxide A schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus for carbon-dioxide-assisted ODH of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen is demonstrated in Fig. 1 . The catalytic experiments were implemented in a quartz-made tubular continuous flow reactor (i.d., 8 mm; thickness 2 mm). The reactor was loaded with 200−800 mg of fresh catalyst, which was located in the central section of the reactor over a porous plate. The experiments were conducted at 600 °C, 650 °C, and 700 °C. The loaded reactor is located in an electrical furnace to supply high reaction temperatures. ODH of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen was attained by passing a mixture of ethane, carbon dioxide, and argon at a C2H6/CO2/Ar = 1/5/4 ratio through the catalytic bed at a total gas flow rate of 50 mL/min. This would result in a gas hourly space velocity (i.e. GHSV) of 2250−9000 Lreactant/kgcatalyst.hr. The component flowrates were separately adjusted by Alicat Scientific mass flow controllers (MC-1SLPM-D). Prior to each experiment, the fresh catalyst particles were activated in situ at reaction conditions by 20 mL/min of argon stream for at least 30 min. The reaction temperature within the fixed bed of catalyst particles was measured by a thermocouple equipped on the top of the catalyst bed. At the end of each test, the composition of the reactor effluent gas stream was monitored with an on-line gas chromatograph (GC112A) equipped with a TCD (4 mm stainless steel packed column: Porapak Q, 2 m in length). The catalytic performance was evaluated for a 1 h reaction and the results of 5, 30, and 60 min time on stream (TOS) are reported. The conversion of reactants (X), the selectivity of products (S), and the yield of products (Y) were calculated by the following equation. (1) X i = F i i n − F i o u t F i i n i = E t h a n e o r c a r b o n d i o x i d e (2) S i = F i o u t F E t h a n e i n − F E t h a n e o u t i = E t h y l e n e , h y d r o g e n , o r m e t h a n e S j = F j o u t F C a r b o n D i o x i d e i n − F C a r b o n d i o x i d e o u t j = C a r b o n m o n o x i d e (3) Y i = X E t h a n e × S i i = E t h y l e n e , h y d r o g e n , o r m e t h a n e Y j = X C a r b o n d i o x i d e × S j j = C a r b o n m o n o x i d e Where F is the molar flowrate of components."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts XRD measurements were implemented to confirm the presence of cobalt, molybdenum, and alumina and phase identification in the catalyst structure. The results are depicted in Fig. 2 . The broad diffraction peaks of cubic aluminum oxide are observed at ≈46° and ≈67° for both samples. The cubic cobalt oxide phase is characterized by the observed peaks at ≈44.2°, ≈51.5°, and ≈76.0°. Furthermore, the presence of the molybdenum oxide phase is characterized by the observed peaks at ≈40.8°, ≈59.0°, and ≈74.0°. Li et al. [78] stated that the peaks of 2θ = 20°-35° are CoMoO4 crystallites. Similar statements were reported by Van Venn et al. [79] and Jiang et al. [80]. Due to the very low wt.%, uniform dispersion, and small cobalt particles, the weakly associated peaks were observed. Similar observations were reported in the pioneer works dedicated to Co-Mo catalysts [81,82]. The results of H2-TPR experiments will be then discussed in the next section to develop the reaction pathways. The well-known Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Langmuir, t-plot, and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) analyses applied to the measured nitrogen adsorption/desorption data were employed to determine the textual properties (i.e. average pore diameter, specific surface area, and pore volume) of catalyst samples. The results are well presented in Fig. 3 and Table 1 . As depicted in Fig. 3 (a), the typically reversible type IV isotherms with H2 hysteresis loops are observed for both catalyst samples. Furthermore, narrow pore size distributions of both catalysts are depicted in Fig. 3 (b). This figure indicates that the catalysts sample possess particles with very similar and identical pore sizes. As tabulated in Table 1, the calculated surface area and pore volume of DC 13 KHT catalyst are larger than those of HDS 16A. However, it possesses slightly smaller pores. DC 130 KHT provides 224.39 m2/g BET surface area, whilst the BET surface area of HDS 16A is 137.09 m2/g. The calculated BJH cumulative desorption pore volumes of DC 130 KHT and HDS 16A catalysts samples are 0.4616 cm3/g and 0.3682 cm3/g, respectively. Furthermore, 7.42 nm and 7.98 nm average pore sizes of DC 130 KHT and HDS 16A, respectively allow for the diffusion of gaseous reactants (i.e. ethane and carbon dioxide) and the formation of products."
7,Catalytic conversion of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen with carbon dioxide,"3.2 Catalytic conversion of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen with carbon dioxide As mentioned previously, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide is investigated at various temperatures and GHSVs. The obtained results are presented and compared in this section. The major products are ethylene, hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. The maximum carbon (C) balance variation in all experiments did not exceed 5.7 %. Typical carbon balances for both catalysts are presented in Table 2 . A set of experimental data points was also repeated to ensure the reproducibility of the data. Accordingly, the experiments at 700 °C over DC 130 KHT were repeated, the results of which are presented in Figs. 4–6 with error bars. The effects of reaction temperature and a criteria of space time (i.e. the inverse of GHSV) on the conversions of ethane and carbon dioxide are depicted in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. An increase in temperature results in an improved oxidation reaction and thus in higher conversions of ethane and carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the conversions of ethane and carbon dioxide decrease with increasing GHSV, i.e. the reduced space time. This is in fact due to the contact of smaller quantities of catalysts in the constant quantities of reactants. By increasing space time, the conversions increase. In almost all the reaction conditions, DC 130 KHT catalyst, which is composed of 3.4 wt.% cobalt and 13.6 wt.% molybdenum, provides higher activity toward the conversion of ethane and carbon dioxide. As mentioned previously, this catalyst provides a larger surface area and pore volume than HDS 16A. Larger cobalt oxide content and also larger surface area might be the main reason for higher conversions over DC 130 KHT catalyst. The maximum conversions of ethane and carbon dioxide were observed at 700 °C and GSHV = 2250 L/kg.hr. At this reaction condition, the utilization of DC 130 KHT catalyst led to 88.35 % and 28.25 % conversions of ethane and carbon dioxide, respectively, whilst 56.95 % and 20.25 % conversions of ethane and carbon dioxide were obtained over HDS 16A catalyst. To have a detailed view of the catalyst performance, the results of selectivities and yields of ethylene and hydrogen are discussed. The obtained results over DC 130 KHT and HDS 16A catalysts are depicted in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively. The results of Fig. 6 depict that an increase in temperature leads to lower selectivities and yields of ethylene over DC 130 KHT catalyst. However, at GHSV = 9000 L/kg.hr (the shortest experimented space time), higher yields of ethylene are observed at the higher temperature. The trends of hydrogen are different. By increasing the temperature, the yields of hydrogen production increase in all cases. The highest hydrogen yield was obtained at GHSV = 2250 L/kg.hr (the longest experimented space time) and 700 °C. Different trends are observed in the case of the HDS 16A catalyst. As depicted in Fig. 7, increasing temperature results in increasing both ethylene and hydrogen yields at all GHSVs. The maximum yield of ethylene production over DC 130 KHT catalyst was obtained at 600 °C and GHSV = 3600 L/kg.hr, which was about 23.9 %. About 59.0 % yield of hydrogen production over the DC 130 KHT catalyst was obtained at GHSV = 2250−3600 L/kg.hr and 700 °C. Whilst, the utilization of the HDS 16A catalyst led to the maximum yield of 42.9 % at 700 °C and GHSV = 9000 L/kg.hr for ethylene production and the maximum yield of 42.7 % at 700 °C and GHSV = 2250 L/kg.hr for hydrogen production. The results of maximum yields reveal that 23.9 kmol/hr (at 600 °C and GHSV = 3600 L/kg.hr) and 42.9 kmol/hr (at 700 °C and GHSV = 9000 L/kg.hr) ethylene could be produced per 100 kmol/hr ethane consumption by the utilization of DC 130 KHT and HDS 16A catalysts, respectively. Per 100 kmol/hr ethane consumption at 700°, about 59.0 kmol/hr (at GHSV = 2250−3600 L/kg.hr) and 42.7 kmol/hr (at GHSV = 2250 L/kg.hr) hydrogen would be produced over DC 130 KHT and HDS 16A catalysts, respectively. The other obtained products could be utilized as a source of methane or synthesis gas. The results of selectivities and yields of other products including methane and carbon monoxide are provided in the Supporting Material. In the absence of oxidants such as carbon dioxide, the direct dehydrogenation (DD) of ethane is restricted due to the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. These limitations make it difficult to manage higher conversions and yields at lower temperatures. In the presence of oxidants such as carbon dioxide, ethylene is generated by both DD and ODH pathways, simultaneously [13,56,83]. The carbon-dioxide-assisted pathway includes the reduction of metallic oxides by ethane and hydrogen and further re-oxidation of lattice oxygen by the surface oxygen obtained from the dissociation of carbon dioxide. These reduction/re-oxidation steps in the presence of carbon dioxide help to eliminate or, at least, attenuate the aforementioned thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. Moreover, carbon dioxide participates in the reverse water-gas shift reaction leading to the removal of hydrogen generated from the DD pathway. This would also result in shifting the equilibrium of DD of ethane. Hence, carbon dioxide enhances the dehydrogenation of ethane by providing oxygen and further re-oxidation of lattice oxygen of metallic oxides or/and by consuming hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Carbon dioxide is also involved in the reforming of ethane to carbon monoxide and hydrogen [60,71,84,85]. Hence, based on the observed results, the whole probable reactions occurring in the carbon-dioxide-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen on the oxides of cobalt and molybdenum could be as in the following [13,47,60,71,84,85]. (4) D i r e c t D e h y d r o g e n a t i o n C 2 H 6 → C 2 H 4 + H 2 (5) R e v e r s e w a t e r g a s s h i f t C O 2 + H 2 → CO + H 2 O (6) R e d u c t i o n o f m o l y b d e n u m o x i d e C 2 H 6 + Mo O x → C 2 H 4 + Mo O x − 1 + H 2 O (7) R e − o x i d a t i o n o f m o l y b d e n u m Mo O x − 1 + C O 2 → CO + Mo O x (8) R e f o r m i n g o f e t h a n e C 2 H 6 + 2 C O 2 → 4 CO + 3 H 2 (9) C r a c k i n g o f e t h a n e C 2 H 6 + H 2 → 2 C H 4 A graphical representation of the reaction mechanism is also presented in Fig. 8 . The reduction of cobalt oxide and its further reoxidation were not considered in the suggested pathways. The H2-TPR experiments were implemented to find out the reduction of the metallic oxides in the reaction temperature range. The results of H2-TPR experiments (Fig. 9 ) demonstrate that the Mo6+-Mo4+ sites of the samples are characterized by the larger sharp peaks initiating at 300 °C (≈300−600 °C). Such sites exist in the dispersed octahedral polymeric structures of Mo or in the amorphous multi-layered MoOx oxides [78,86,87]. The next peaks initiating at 550 °C (≈550−680 °C) demonstrate the initial reduction of Co-Mo spinels of CoMoO4-Co2Mo3O8 [78,88]. Temperature increase up to 900 °C leads to the sharp increases in the uptakes, which would be due to the supplementary reduction of remaining Mo oxides including the as-reduced oxides at the lower temperatures (≈300−700 °C) and the strongly-bounded spinels of alumina-Mo6+ [78,87,89]. CoOx reduction peaks were not observed in the experimented temperature range. Hence, the suggested reaction pathways do not include the reduction of cobalt oxide and its further re-oxidation. The observations of the previous studies also confirm such a statement [80,88]. Koirala et al. [60,71] depicted that the oxidation state, as well as the interaction of cobalt phases, strongly depend on the support type. Very strong interactions between the cobalt oxides and the alumina support were observed leading to a shift of the reduction temperature to higher than 900 °C [71]. This might be due to the formation of CoAl2O4 mixed oxides [82,90]. Koirala et al. [60] demonstrated that the non-redox pathways for the carbon-dioxide-assisted conversion of ethane on the CoOx/SiO2 catalysts prevail. This was probably due to the difficult reduction of these catalysts. Hence, they suggested a mechanism including the reverse water-gas shift reaction shifting the equilibrium state of DD reaction and reverse Boudouard reaction to remove coke in the presence of carbon dioxide. It is also worth noting that the proposed mechanism is based on the experimental observations, catalyst ingredients (Mo and Co oxides), and the reduction states of the catalysts. As per Fig. 9, the reduction properties of the two samples are almost the same. The different surface areas (Table 1) arise from the different Co and Mo concentrations in the catalysts and maybe their different production methods. The surface area difference does not change the reaction mechanism. The reduction properties of the catalysts are the main affecting parameters in this regard. Generally, the reaction pathway strongly affects the formation and distribution of the desired components such as ethylene and hydrogen. However, the performance of the catalyst could be changed with TOS. To evaluate the stability of utilized catalysts, the effect of TOS on the conversions of ethane and carbon dioxide and the yields of ethylene and hydrogen are discussed. To do so, Figs. 10–13 are presented, although they do not intend to describe the lifetime characteristics of the investigated catalysts because longer-time experimental tests would be needed. Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate the effect of TOS on the performance of DC 130 KHT and HDS 16A catalysts, respectively. Their performances are compared in terms of conversions of ethane and carbon dioxide. As depicted in Figs. 10(a)–(c) and Figs. 11(a)-(c), a slight decrease in the conversion of ethane is observed in almost all cases. The sintering of catalyst particles or even the deposition of coke could be the probable reasons for such results. The highest reduction in the conversion of ethane is observed at 700 °C and GHSV of 3600 L/kg.hr over DC 130 KHT catalyst, which is about 14.7 %. As depicted in Figs. 10(d)-(f) and 11 (d)-(f), the conversion of carbon dioxide tends to increase with increasing TOS in almost all the cases. However, more than a 7% decrease is observed at 700 °C and GHSV of 3600 L/kg.hr over DC 130 KHT catalyst. A higher reduction over the HDS 16A catalyst is observed at lower temperatures. Moreover, slight decreases are observed in the whole conditions except at GHSV of 9000 L/kg.hr (the shortest experimented space time). Increasing carbon dioxide conversion with TOS is also observed in almost all the conditions over the HDS 16A catalyst. Despite the slight decrease in the conversion of ethane, the yields of ethylene increase with TOS. The effect of TOS on the yields of ethylene over DC 130 KHT and HDS 16A catalysts are depicted in Figs. 12(a)-(c) and 13 (a)-(c), respectively. In fact, higher yields of ethylene were obtained at lower conversions. The most increase in the yield of ethylene is observed in the case of the HDS 16A catalyst at 600 °C and GHSV of 9000 L/kg.hr. More than 86 % increase is observed in this case. As depicted in Figs. 12(d)-(f) and 13 (d)-(f), the yields of hydrogen are almost constant with increasing TOS. However, some exceptions are observed, especially at 700 °C. Generally, the obtained results show that alumina-supported cobalt-molybdenum catalysts are stable in the reaction condition of carbon-dioxide-assisted conversion of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen. The obtained results of the present contribution are compared quantitatively with those of previous studies in Table 3 . The reaction conditions for the reported results are also summarized. It would be interesting to note that the calculation of selectivity and yield might be different in various reported studies. No further change or adaptation was applied and thus the original reported selectivities and yield are summarized in Table 3. Moreover, the previous studies did not focus on hydrogen generation. Hence, the comparison is implemented in terms of ethylene production. As presented, the other Al2O3-supported catalysts do not provide very good activity and yield in the conversion of ethane to ethylene via carbon dioxide. However, SiO2, H-ZSM5, and MSU-1 supported catalysts provide considerable conversions and yields. The obtained results of this study reveal that CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts are beneficial for ethylene production via ODH of ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide. Also, worth paying special attention to is the commercially-developed state of investigated catalysts. As a whole, the reported ethane conversions and ethylene yields of studied catalysts, which are comparable with the highest quantities of reported synthesized catalysts in the literature, and also the suitable stability state of these catalysts in the reaction condition infer that they are capable of utilizing the large-scale applications."
8,Conclusion,"Commercial cobalt-molybdenum catalysts were evaluated for the conversion of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen in the presence of carbon dioxide. The catalysts showed very good activity, yield, and stability in the studied reaction condition. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of reaction temperature and GHSV was also implemented. The performance of catalysts was evaluated in the temperature range of 600−700 °C and GHSV range of 2250−9000 Lreactant/kgcatalyst.hr. A reaction mechanism including the oxidative and non-oxidative pathways was also developed according to the observed products. The utilization of a catalyst sample composed of 3.4 wt.% cobalt and 13.6 wt.% molybdenum led to 88.4 % conversion of ethane and 28.3 % conversion of carbon dioxide at 700 °C and GHSV = 2250 Lreactant/kgcatalyst.hr at the initial reaction time. The highest initial hydrogen yield (59.10 %) was also obtained in this condition. However, the highest initial ethylene yield was obtained over the catalyst sample made up of 4.4 wt.% cobalt and 7.5 wt.% molybdenum, which was 42.95 % at 700 °C and GHSV of 9000 Lreactant/kgcatalyst.hr. The stability of catalyst samples was determined through the analysis of conversion and yields with time. In almost all cases, a slight decrease in the conversion of ethane and an increase in the conversion of carbon dioxide were observed. The yields of ethylene were found to increase with time on stream, while the hydrogen yields were almost constant. The results of the present contribution reveal that commercial alumina-supported cobalt-molybdenum catalysts are highly active and selective for the simultaneous production of ethylene and hydrogen from ethane. Accordingly, the utilization of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant enhances the thermal effectiveness of conversion of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen as also reduces the released carbon dioxide to the atmosphere."
