0,Introduction,"Nowadays, hybrid nanostructures/nanocomposite-based detectors or sensors have recently been in a great interest among researchers and suitably being employed at large scale in various applications. In recent years, carbon nanomaterials and their nanocomposite structures have been considered as one of the facile and promising designs in various sensing applications [1,2]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are predominantly being used in large number of sensing devices, more specifically in alcohol sensors due to their high aspect ratio, having so many defects available to adsorb gas/vapor molecules [3,4]. Further, its hollow geometrical structure is highly favorable to enhance the sensitivity and reduce the operating temperature of sensors. It's an excellent material having unique chemical and physical properties and recognized to reveal charge-sensitive conductance and therefore are superior materials for alcohol sensing [5,6]. The sensing of alcohol is significant for multiple purposes such, as the production of ethanol, industrial use of alcohol, fuel processing, research on alcoholism, and other societal applications. Therefore, several commercially available alcohol detection devices are available in the market for various applications [7]. However, there are some disadvantages towards the successful employment of CNTs based commercial alcohol sensors and these are awfully high response to the spectrum of gases. They offer relatively low sensitivity, poor selectivity and recovery is also very slow. Therefore, still there are a lot of issues which have to be resolved like in-homogeneity of the samples, response time, sensitivity and selectivity. These are the key parameters that eventually establish the efficacy of CNTs based alcohol sensing device applications [8,9]. On the other hand, Silicon Nanowires (SiNWs) are the most promising nanomaterial which is capable of operating at room temperature, due to their high chemical activity and large aspect ratio [10,11]. The 1D structure of SiNWs makes them an attractive material for gas/vapor sensing applications which is capable of detecting various types of toxic and hazardous gases/vapors [12]. For example, In et al. [13] and other researchers have shown the ultrasensitive response of SiNW array sensors for the detection of rarefied gases of NH3 and NO2 at room temperature, even though the response is quite slow [14,15]. Another pronounced advantage of SiNWs is that the confinement of excitons makes them suitable to modify their electrical and optical properties so that SiNWs act as building block nanomaterials for various innovative applications not only for sensing devices but also for solar cells and other electronic devices [16,17]. However, perfect sensing device from pristine SiNWs is hardly reported because of the two reasons. Primary, lack of synthesis methods which are mostly published on top-down lithographic technique or vapor liquid-solid phenomenon. They scarcely produce NWs having a suitable size to display high aspect ratio and strong quantum confinement effects. Secondary, the surface oxidation of the SiNW in the air due to which it can't be easily integrated with other microelectronic devices. To resolve the above issues, researchers have made a speculation that, coating of CNTs on SiNWs provide a core-sheath nanocomposite structure and the design of CNTs/SiNWs nanostructure could be employed in large number of applications [18]. It has been observed that the surface of SiNWs is easily oxidized in air, whereas CNTs have high tensile strength and extremely large Young's modulus. Therefore, the deposition of CNTs sheath around SiNWs core could be an effective approach to avoid surface oxidation of SiNWs which is very commonly associated with Si nanowire and therefore, the new nanostructure can be used in different novel applications [19–22]. Shu Q. et al. [23] has reported that CNTs/SiNW hetrojunction can be used to design a hybrid solar cell that shows high energy conversion efficiencies. CNT-SiNW hetro-junction based multifunctional device for photovoltaic conversion and toxic gas sensitivity has been reported by Jia Y. et al. [18]. However, CNTs/SiNWs based alcohol vapor sensing has scarcely been reported by any researchers to date. Thus, keeping in view of the above facts, we have worked on the simple and cost-effective method of synthesizing SiNWs as well as the fabrication of MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure for considerable sensing of alcohol vapors at the lowest ppm level. Highly dense, vertically aligned SiNWs have been grown by Metal Assisted Chemical Etching (MACE) technique on p-type polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) substrate which is a very simple and inexpensive method. Further, MWCNTs have been grown separately using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. Then, MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure was formed by a simple drop-casting chemical (DCC) process and the device was fabricated on PCB using silver-coated electrodes. Finally, the fabricated device was tested for alcohol vapors using Keithley electrometer based indigenously designed sensing set-up."
1,Experimental details,"(i). Synthesis of MWCNTs using CVD In this work, MWCNTs were grown by using thermal CVD at atmospheric conditions. Initially, Iron (Fe) as catalyst was deposited on Si substrate using RF sputtering (Make HIND HIVAC, Bangalore, India, model: 2” MSPT). During Fe deposition, vacuum inside the RF sputtering chamber was achieved at 10−6 Torr while Argon (Ar) gas pressure was maintained at 2 Torr. Prior to the growth process, quartz tube was purged using Nitrogen (N2) gas in order to remove contamination and then the CVD chamber was evacuated to a low pressure of 10−3 Torr using Rotary Pump (RP). After that Fe deposited Si substrate was positioned inside the quartz tube chamber of the CVD system and pre-treated at 600 °C for 10 min under Hydrogen (H2) gas atmosphere. After pre-treatment, the Acetylene (C2H2) as source gas with flow rate of 20 sccm and H2 and Ammonia (NH3) as carrier gas with flow rate of 50 and 100 sccm were inserted together into the chamber. The growth time and the pressure inside the chamber were kept 10 min and 500 Torr respectively. During growth time, the temperature was maintained at 700 °C. Lastly, the CVD system was turned off and the sample was left inside the chamber for cooling it to room temperature. Finally, grown MWCNTs were taken out from Si substrate by using ultrasonication process which were further used for decorating SiNWs to fabricate MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure. (ii). Synthesis of SiNWs by MACE process The SiNWs were grown on pc-Si substrate using MACE process. Before the growth process of SiNWs, the pc-Si wafers were cleaned sequentially for 12 min using DI water, IPA solution, soap solution, acetone. After that piranha solution was prepared by mixing Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) and Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) in the ratio 3:1 and then Si wafers were immersed in the piranha solution for about 30 min. After this process, Si wafer was then dipped into dilute Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) solution for approximately 3 min to eradicate the native oxide so that the substrate surface becomes hydrophobic. Just after the pre-cleaning process is over, the etched solution was prepared by using 0.02 M AgNO3 (99.5%) and 4.6 M HF (38–40%). The Si substrates were then dipped in this solution for about 1 h at room temperature. The oxidation-reduction reaction which takes place is as follows [24]: Si(s) + 4Ag+ + 6HF → 4Ag(s) + 4H+ + H2SiF6 During this process, as the equally dispersed Ag ions come in contact with the surface of Si substrate, the galvanic reactions occur as shown above. Therefore, Si is lost into the solution as SiF6, and leaves pits on the surface of Si wafer. The reaction occurs explicitly in the region where the etching process has already been started and therefore, due to this selective growth process of holes all over the surface, the remaining structure developed into vertically aligned arrays of SiNWs. Lastly, the samples were washed with DI water several times and placed in Nitric Acid (HNO3) solution for about 25–30 min to remove the Ag dendrite layer which was formed on top of the SiNWs array. Finally, the samples were again rinsed with DI water and dried. The schematic diagram of the synthesized SiNWs has been shown in Fig. 1 . (iii). Fabrication of MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure For the synthesis of MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure, 2 mg of MWCNTs were mixed with 10 ml of ethanol solution and ultrasonicated for 40 min. After sonication, the solution consists of well-dispersed, small bundles of MWCNTs. In order to fabricate MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure, dispersed solution of MWCNTs was drop-casted on the substrate comprising of SiNW grown on Si chip. Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram of the fabricated MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure. (iv). Characterization of as-grown materials and MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure The structural, morphological and stoichiometry analysis of the as-grown materials (SiNWs, MWCNTs and their hybrid nanostructure) were observed by using different instruments such as scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Zeiss EVO-18) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL JEM-1400). The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Rigaku smartlab) and Raman spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon (LABRAM HR 800 JY) at a wavelength of 633 nm were used to study the crystallographic and structural analysis of the prepared nanostructure, respectively. The elemental analysis of the MWCNTs/SiNWs was done by using energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) of Oxford Instruments ‘X-max’. (v) Fabrication of MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure-based Alcohol Sensor For the fabrication of alcohol sensor, electrodes were prepared on MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure film using conducting silver paste keeping the gap of approximately 3 mm. After that, electrodes were dried for 6 h under normal conditions. The MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure film was mounted on PCB with proper contacts using soldering iron rod. The electrical contacts were confirmed by the V–I response of the film. The whole assembly was put in a chamber and contacts were connected to electrometer and computer for data acquisition in the form of change in resistance with respect to time as shown in Fig. 3 . Sensitivity of the sensor, apart from alcohol, has also been tested with acetone, for its comparison, under same laboratory conditions. The samples were also tested under specific humidity condition to verify, if any adverse conditions are there. The resistivity of the sensor was measured by a two-probe resistivity method using Electrometer (Keithley, Model: 6514) at room temperature."
2,Results and discussions,
3,Characterization of as-grown samples,"3.1 Characterization of as-grown samples (i). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis SEM is a powerful investigative technique to study the surface topography of the grown materials more specifically to understand the shape, size, and morphology of small particles. Fig. 4 (a) reveals the uniformly distributed MWCNTs upon Si substrate. The highly magnified view of MWCNTs has been shown in Fig. 4(b) which illustrates that the grown MWCNTs are multi-walled with diameter in the range of 30–60 nm and length up to several micrometers. Fig. 4(c) depicts the vertically aligned Si nanowires uniformly distributed and closely spaced over the Si chip. The high magnification micrograph of SiNWs has been shown in Fig. 4(d) and illustrates the diameter distribution in the range of 50–100 nm with length in the micrometer range. Further, MWCNTs were decorated over the surface of SiNWs as shown in Fig. 4 (e) and (f). From the micrographs 4(e) and 4(f), it can be observed that MWCNTs are uniformly decorated with maximum coverage and stacking over the surface of SiNWs. This may be attributed due to the defects created during the synthesis of SiNWs which are responsible for the bonding of CNTs that helps in the formation of a hybrid nanostructure between two materials. (ii). Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) analysis TEM micrographs of SiNWs and MWCNTs decorated SiNWs have been shown in Fig. 5 . For TEM analysis, SiNWs and MWCNTs decorated SiNWs were separately dispersed in ethanol using the ultrasonic bath for 20 min. The dispersed solutions were drop cast upon the carbon-coated copper grid for TEM analysis. The TEM micrograph of SiNWs has been shown in Fig. 5(a). The micrograph reveals the stacked SiNWs of approximate length 3–4 μm. MWCNTs decorated SiNWs have been shown in Fig. 5(b) and it can be observed that MWCNTs dispersed with SiNWs are almost uni-directional and easily stacked with each other. It is due to the fact that MWCNTs have the affinity to stack or coagulate with other materials thus MWCNTs get piled up with the surface of SiNWs. (iii). EDS analysis From the EDS results, the weight% and atomic% of the elements of the prepared nanostructure are depicted in Fig. 6 . The presence of C and Si elements can be observed with their respective atomic percentages of 42.86% and 57.14% respectively which confirms the MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure of the prepared sample. (iv). Raman Spectroscopic analysis Raman spectroscopy is the most powerful and efficient technique for the structural analysis of CNTs and CNTs decorated SiNWs. The Raman spectra of MWCNTs decorated SiNWs have been shown in Fig. 6. Usually, the Raman spectra of CNTs consists of three major bands which are named as D band, G band and G′ band (or also known as 2D band). Here, the D band stands for the degree of defects in the crystalline structure of MWCNTs and generally found at around 1310–1350 cm−1. The G and G′ bands are indicative of stokes phonon energy shift which is caused due to laser excitation of the sample. Precisely, the G band corresponds to the primary in-plane vibrational mode of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. This G band is doubly degenerated phonon mode at the Brillouin zone which is often found at around 1590 cm−1. Another G’ band also named as 2D band originates from the second overtone of different in-plane vibrations of D peak and is being widely used to verify the band structure of CNTs [25]. From Fig. 7 , a very prominent peak at 507 cm−1 was observed which represents the existence of Si. Further, two bands at 1316 and 1590 cm−1 were detected and corresponds to the D and G band respectively. These are characteristics bands of MWCNTs and the ratio of peak intensity (ID/IG) can be utilized to understand the degree of graphitization or defects in the fabricated structure. From Fig. 7, the ID/IG ratio was calculated to be 0.60 which shows more defects in the MWCNTs based composite structure. Since, MWCNTs have stacked with SiNWs; therefore, the degree of graphitization is not quite reasonable in the fabricated hybrid nanostructure. (v). XRD Analysis X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is a better way to understand the crystallographic structure of the prepared hybrid nanostructure. The diffraction patterns for the MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure have been shown in Fig. 8 . It can be observed that the 2θ-diffraction peak at around 28.8° can be indexed to the cubic Si phase with (111) plane (JCPDS no. 77–2108). Moreover, the sharp prominent (101) plane peak at around 44.68° arises due to the carbon structure and more specifically due to CNTs [26]. However, no other peaks of any different phases were detected."
4,MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure sensing studies for alcohol vapors,"The sensing studies of alcohol vapors concentration of 1 ppm under atmospheric conditions using bare SiNWs, MWCNTs and MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure were investigated by recording the changes of sensor resistance with respect to time, at room temperature. Fig. 9 reveals the behavior of as-grown SiNWs and pristine MWCNTs towards alcohol vapors, independently. It was observed that as-grown SiNWs does not show any response when exposed to alcohol vapors. However, pristine MWCNTs have exhibited a minor change in resistance ~3.33% when exposed with alcohol vapors of 1 ppm (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the stability of the pristine sensor is also degrading when the sensor was repeatedly exposed for 5 cycles. That is why, in order to enhance the sensing properties, MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure was opted and the response of the fabricated sensor was measured in terms of change in resistance with respect to time. The data were collected after 10–15 s of exposure with alcohol vapors so that a proper mixing of alcohol vapors in the test chamber is achieved. Fig. 10 illustrates the dynamic response curve of MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure and it was observed that upon exposure with alcohol vapors, the resistance of the fabricated sensor increases with respect to time. The sensor response was calculated using the relation Rg/Ra, where Rg and Ra stand for the resistances of the sensor in the presence of alcohol vapors and in air respectively (Fig. 10). It has been observed that MWCNTs/SiNWs show extremely high response ~1.42 for alcohol vapors and it recovered to its original state very quickly in 5 s as the alcohol vapors removed from the sensing chamber. For the repeatability of the sensor, data was recorded with five (05) ON/OFF cycles of alcohol vapors as shown in Fig. 11 which confirms its reproducible sensing nature. A comparison table of the existing literature with the present reported work has been shown in Table 1 . It can be concluded that the fabricated MWCNTs/SiNWs sensor characteristics are excellent at 1 ppm concentration at Room temperature with recovery and response time and not reported so far. Sensing Mechanism: Since, all the sensing properties of the fabricated sensor were recorded at room temperature and sensor recovery is also very fast (5 s) without applying any external energy source. Therefore, it can be explained that the alcohol vapors interact with MWCNTs/SiNWs through a physisorption process only as also shown by Eklund et al. [34] in his paper on the physisorption of alcohol and water on the electrical transport of carbon nanotube bundles. Hence, in the present work, the alcohol vapor sensing mechanism can be elucidated by exploring favorable properties of analyte as alcohol vapors and MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure as sensing element. A schematic diagram showing alcohol vapors interaction with MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure has also been shown in the Fig. 12 . The previous work by V. Bhatia et al. [35] suggests that functionalized CNTs can act as a gas sensing element for alcohol vapor detection. They have shown that alcohol molecule's van der Waal's interaction with functionalized CNTs show an increase in resistance due to restricted transportation of charge carriers. In our case, the synthesized MWCNTs have characteristic dangling bonds as also reported by other researchers [36] for adsorption of incoming gas molecules. The associated defects in our grown MWCNTs have also been confirmed from Raman spectrum as shown in Fig. 7. Since during the synthesis of MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure, the CNTs were dispersed by ultrasonication which further helps in enhancing its dangling bonds as also shown by Arrigo et al. [37] and Cheng et al. [38] in their work. The dispersed CNTs then drop casted onto the surface of SiNWs. Since, these dispersed CNTs have very high aspect ratio along with diameter lying in nanometer range, therefore, they have better molecular interaction and entanglement with vertically aligned Si nanowires structure as shown by Huang et al. [39]. This entanglement of CNTs with SiNWs is significantly enhancing dangling bond density of CNTs due to large surface area of SiNWs that favors stronger van der Waal's interaction and thus it helps in enhancing overall adsorption properties of CNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure-based sensor [40]. The sensor response towards target gas species can be observed by a change in some physical parameters induced by the absorption of molecules, namely a change in conductivity, resistivity, dielectric constant, etc. Herein, alcohol vapors detection has been recorded through the change in resistivity (or conductivity) or resistance with respect to time. Since, the conductivity of any conducting material (CNTs/SiNWs) can be expressed by σ = p e μ p ; where p , e, and μ p are carrier density, electron charge and mobility of charge carriers (hole) and the mobility of charge carrier is given by μ p = e τ m ; where τ and m are mean life time and mass of charge carrier, respectively. Therefore, the gas sensing based on physisorption mechanism suggests that the resistance variation occurs due to change in charge carrier mobility [41]. In the present work, when alcohol vapors interact with MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure, then the significant rise in dangling bonds in MWCNTs along with large surface area of SiNWs favours dominance of van der Waal's interaction. Due to this, there is restricted motion of charged carriers in sensing element (MWCNTs/SiNWs) and causing reduction in the mobility of the charge carriers and thus decrease in charge carriers life time occurs. The reduction in charge carrier mobility leads to decrease in the conductivity of the sample and resistance of the sensor increased as depicted in Fig. 11. Since, this type of adsorption (physisorption) requires negligible activation energy (<0.1 eV) at room temperature, therefore response and recovery time of our fabricated sensor is very quick ~ 3 s & 5 s, respectively [42] as evident from Figs. 10 and 11. It is also evident from this mechanism that if MWCNTs are grown on bare p-type Si wafer, then due to less adsorption of alcohol species, sensitivity is very poor (Fig. 9). Further, if only SiNWs on Si chip are used as sensing element, there is no sensitivity as shown in Fig. 9. Therefore, the large surface area of MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure, enhanced dangling bonds density in MWCNTs are responsible for enhanced sensitivity towards alcohol vapors detection along with excellent response and recovery time as shown in Figs. 10 and 11 and most importantly the adhesion of the MWCNTs with the substrate becomes stronger than ever. The selectivity of this MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure is further shown in Fig. 13 for alcohol, acetone and humidity. Higher sensitivity towards alcohol can be attributed to its bipolar nature while lower sensitivity towards acetone can be attributed to monopolar nature [43]. These bipolar molecules possess stronger local interaction between electron donor molecules and electron acceptor sites available in MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure as compare to monopolar molecule. It means that alcohol molecules are providing relatively larger surface area of charges for van der Wall's interaction and so sensitivity for alcohol is more than acetone. Least sensitivity towards highly polar water molecule can be attributed to its significantly lesser size as compare to alcohol and acetone. This lesser size of water molecules decreases significantly the surface area of incoming donor charges molecules interaction with acceptor sites available in MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure for van der Wall's interaction [44]. The lesser surface area of charges weakens van der Wall's interaction of water molecules with the sites available in MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure. This results into lesser physical effects of its vapors in surface adsorption and least restrict the charge carrier motion due to which sample shows slight change in resistance. Thus, water molecule sensing is poor as compare to alcohol and acetone molecules because of its least size amongst all molecules considered for investigation in the physisorption phenomenon. This has also been confirmed from the observed selectivity as shown in Fig. 13 of the manuscript. The MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure-based sensor was also exposed to 49% humidity and response was recorded as shown in Fig. 14 . It was observed that sensor reveals very less response ~1.06 towards water vapors molecule and fully recovered back when sensor removed from humidity chamber. Therefore, it could be expected from the response curve that the behavior of the sensor does not distress considerably and therefore, indicates the stable behavior of the sensor even under adverse moist conditions of the atmosphere. The stability of the fabricated MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructured based sensor has been recorded for 20 days and no variation in response has been observed as shown in Fig. 15 ."
5,Conclusions,"Here in this work, SiNWs and MWCNTs were separately synthesized using MACE and CVD technique respectively. MWCNTs/SiNWs nanostructure was fabricated utilizing a drop-casting technique. It was observed from electron microscopic analysis that grown structures are uniform, unidirectional and freely stacking in the hybrid nanostructure. The sensing studies of the fabricated MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructured sensor revealed that upon exposure with alcohol vapors, the response of the fabricated sensor increases by 38% and it was calculated to be ~1.42 with respect to time. The sensor recovered to its original state (with almost 100% recovery) in a very short time of ~5 s as the alcohol vapors removed from the sensing chamber and has been confirmed by performing five ON/OFF repeatability cycle. The selectivity gas spectrum data reveals that the sensor is highly selective for Alcohol vapors and could be used in adverse conditions. Therefore, our fabricated MWCNTs/SiNWs hybrid nanostructure-based sensor has removed MWCNT based discrepancies such as lower sensitivity, poor selectivity and slow recovery for alcohol and revealed quick response time (3 s), high sensitivity, high selectivity, excellent stability and almost cent percent recovery. Hence, this sensor can be explored for various alcohol industrial applications because of its attractive simple and low-cost features along with desirable sensor properties."
