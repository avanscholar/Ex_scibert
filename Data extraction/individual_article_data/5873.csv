0,Introduction,"With the depletion of resources and the deterioration of the climate, energy and environment have become the permanent problems that must be faced and solved [1–3]. The development and utilization of renewable energies is one of the effective ways to alleviate the crises. And hydrogen has attracted enormous attention as an environment-friendly and high-energy-density type of the renewable energy [4]. Electrochemical hydrogen production is considered to be an effective carbon-free and promising energy storage approach [5–7]. At present, the most effective electrochemical hydrogen production catalyst with the state-of-the-art catalytic effect is precious metal Pt-based catalysts [8,9]. However, the scarce natural reserves and expensive prices have limited their wide application. The exploration of efficient, cheap, and earth-abundant catalysts to substitute the Pt-based catalysts is in urgently required in the decomposition of water. Transition metal based electrocatalysts have received extensive interests because of their excellent catalytic activity, high charge transfer capacity, easy processing, high natural reserves, and low price [10,11]. Therefore, many transition metal compounds, including oxides [12], carbides [13], nitrides [14,15], selenides [16], sulfides [17], and phosphides [18,19], have been applied in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Among them, transition metal phosphides have attracted particular concern because of its unique charge natures and hydrogenase-like mechanism with high catalytic activity [20]. The element of P in phosphides could strongly bond with the atomic hydrogen and moderately bond to the reaction intermediates to promote the enhanced catalytic performance [21]. Especially, the faradaic efficiency of transition metal phosphides is as high as nearly 100% toward HER in alkaline solutions [22]. Besides, transition metal phosphides also possess the advantages of high catalytic activity and good stability, which meet the rigid requirements of rapid kinetic reaction and good catalytic stability of ideal electrocatalysts for HER [23,24]. It is worth noting that the doping strategy by introducing the second metal could motivate the preferable synergistic effect between the metals and further improve the catalytic activity of transition metal phosphates. So the bimetallic phosphides usually present improved catalytic activity than monometallic phosphides [25]. Nickel phosphide is a highly stable material toward HER due to its unique resistance to corrosion [26]. Cobalt phosphide also has been found to be an outstanding electrocatalyst for HER because of its high conductivity [27]. The combination of nickel phosphide and cobalt phosphide to form the nickel-cobalt bimetallic phosphides has been proved to be an effective strategy to obtain the excellent HRE electrocatalysts. For example, Sumi et al. prepared the NiCoP alloy coating by chemical reduction method, which shows the low overpotential (112 mV) to get the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and low Tafel slope (110 mV dec−1) toward HER in 1 M KOH solution [28]. Besides, the binding energy between the atomic hydrogen and surface of NiCoP catalyst could be greatly improved via oxygen doping [29]. In addition, the introduction of the conductive catalyst supports (such as carbon [30], graphene [31,32], metal [33]) is supposed to be another efficient approach to facilitate the electron transfer and enhance the performance in the HER. For instance, Wang et al. synthesized a layered nanorod-nanoarray hyperbranched NiCoP on nickel foam by convenient solvent thermal and phosphorization methods, which presented the low overpotential of 71 mV and good stability [22]. The composited process of conductive metal and transition metal phosphide can produce a large number of favorable oxygen vacancies for electrocatalysis, which can further improve the conductivity and structural stability of the catalysts [34,35]. Furthermore, the additional improvements of catalytic performances can be achieved by regulating the morphology and architecture of the nanocomposite in view of increasing the active sites, improving the conductivity, and optimizing the structural stability. Nickel-cobalt bimetallic phosphides with various morphologies, such as nanowires [36], nanosheets [37,38], nanospheres [39,40], and nanotubes [41], have been widely studied. Notably, two-dimensional (2D) nickel-cobalt bimetallic phosphate nanosheet structure has attracted enormous attention because of their high mechanical flexibility, continuous conductive pathway, as well as the large specific surface area formed by reasonable spatial utilization. In current work, we aimed at the design and fabrication of NiCoO2–NiCoP nanocomposite with conductive Ni as the substrate for the effective electrochemical hydrogen production. The NiCoO2 nanosheets grown on Ni matrix were obtained as the precursor by one-step dealloying method under the mild condition. Then, the as-obtained NiCoO2/Ni nanocomposite was partially phosphorized via the chemical vapor deposition method to get the final NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite. Due to the rational arrangement of P and O atom, the NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite not only inherits the morphology of oxide, but also possesses the excellent catalytic performance toward the HER. Benefiting from the 2D nanosheets structure with high specific surface area, the NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite electrode showed excellent catalytic performance toward HER in 1 M KOH solution with the low overpotential of 81 mV and small tafel slope of 49.8 mV dec−1 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Specially, NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite presents high catalytic stability for 30 h at 10 mA cm−2 current density in alkaline solution, offering a great feasibility for the practical application in the HER."
1,Experimental details,
2,Experimental section chemicals,"2.1 Experimental section chemicals Potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and anhydrous ethanol (C2H5OH) were purchased from Sinapharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) was purchased from Tianjin Da Mao Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. The commercial Johnson-Matthey (JM) Pt/C catalyst (20 wt%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Nafion solution (5 wt%) was purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co. Ltd. (China). All reagents were of analytic grade and used as received. Deionized water ran through the whole experiment."
3,Material synthesis,"2.2 Material synthesis The NiCoAl alloy was made through refining high pure Al, Ni, and Co (99.99 wt%) in a high frequency arc-furnace followed by melt-spinning under Ar atmosphere to form the NiCoAl alloy foils. The as-prepared Ni10Co5Al85 alloy foils were about 3 mm in the width and 50 μm in the thickness. The porous NiCoO2/Ni intermediate product was prepared by selectively dissolving the Al atom of the NiCoAl source alloy in 1 M NaOH solution for 48 h at room temperature. The as-obtained products were washed several times with deionized water and anhydrous alcohol, followed by drying at room temperature in air. NiCoO2/Ni nanocomposite (40 mg) in a magnetic boat was put at the downstream of the tube furnace while the NaH2PO2 (400 mg) in a magnetic boat was placed upstream protected by Ar atmosphere. The heating rate was 5 °C min−1 from the room temperature and the samples were kept at 350 °C for 2 h with the Ar flowing rate of 100 sccm. For comparison, NiPx and CoPx nanocomposites were synthesized under the same condition, except that the source precursors were NiAl and CoAl alloy, respectively."
4,Material characterization,"2.3 Material characterization The morphology and composition of the as-received products were investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM), High-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEM 2100 F), and scanning electron microscope (SEM, HITACHIS-4800) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The crystal phase of the samples was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Kα, λ = 1.54 Å). The surface chemical species of the samples were verified by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, PHI 5000). The surface area of the product was performed on a Quadrasorb SI-MP instrument using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. All electrochemical measurements were carried out on the CHI760E electrochemical workstation at room temperature (Shanghai Chen Hua Instruments Co., China)."
5,Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements Catalytic ink was prepared by mixing 4 mg NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni alloy power, 750 μL deionized water, 200 μL anhydrous ethanol, and 50 μL Nafion solution under sonication for 15 min to form uniform suspension solution. The working electrode was prepared by adding 10 μL of the catalyst ink on a polished glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 5 mm in diameter) and dried at room temperature, harvesting an evaluated catalyst loading of 0.20 ± 0.01 mg cm−2. For comparison, NiPx, CoPx, NiCoO2/Ni, nanoporous Ni, and commercial JM Pt/C catalyst inks were prepared in the same way. All potentials in the electrochemical tests were provided according to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale to facilitate the comparison. All electrochemical measurements were carried out in a traditional three-electrode cell on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation. GCE, graphite rod electrode, and mercuric oxide (Hg/HgO) electrode were used as working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The electrochemical tests were performed in 1 M KOH solution with the nitrogen saturation for the purpose of removing oxygen. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were measured in a potential range from 0.1 to −0.6 V vs. RHE with the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were applied to calculate electrochemical surface area (ECSA, from 0.1 to 0 V vs. RHE) by electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) to estimate the electrochemical active sites. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at the different overpotentials with the frequency ranging from 105 to 0.01 Hz. The durability and stability of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite electrode was tested by the chronoamperometric curve (i-t) measurements and CV tests, respectively. The normalization of current density to geometric surface area ran through the whole electrochemical test process."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology and structure of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite,"3.1 Morphology and structure of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite SEM was applied to visualize the microstructures of the dealloyed sample. As shown in Fig. 1 a and Fig. 1b, upon dealloying of NiCoAl alloy, uniform nanosheets with the diameter around several hundred nanometers were generated. For the sake of comparison, NiOx and CoOx were also prepared through dealloying the NiAl and CoAl source alloys under the same corrosion conditions. NiOx presented the three dimensional nanoporous structure composed of crosslinked ligaments and hollow channels (Fig. 1c). The CoOx sample exhibited the nanoflower structure comprising of intercrossing hexagonal nanosheets with of the diameter around 5–10 μm (Fig. 1d). In the NiCo bimetallic system, Co atoms tend to diffuse faster to the surface layer than Ni because of their much higher reactivity with oxygen to form Co oxides. The prior segregation of active atoms to the surface is often observed in the multicomponent systems [42]. Consequently, upon dealloying NiCoAl precursor the relatively higher surface content of Co atoms was obtained owing to the alloy segregation, leaving the Ni metal as the internal conductive matrix. The XPS survey spectra of NiCoO2/Ni nanocomposites were illustrated in Fig. S1. The high resolution spectrum of Ni of NiCoO2/Ni comprises six peaks (Fig. S1a). The peaks at 851.9, 855.1, and 860.8 eV are assigned to the metallic Ni, oxidized Ni (Ni2+) as well as the satellite peaks of the Ni 2p3/2, respectively [43,44]. As shown in Fig. S1b, the Co 2p3/2 core-level spectrum exhibits two peaks at 784.8 and 780.1 eV, corresponding to the satellite peak and the oxidized Co (Co2+) [22]. The three bonds in O 1s spectrum corresponding to metal (Ni/Co)-oxygen bond (529.1 eV), O2 component (530.6 eV), and oxygen vacancy (531.9 eV) were observed in Fig. S1c [45]. The dealloyed sample was further partially phosphatized using NaH2PO2 as the phosphorus source in a tube furnace. Fig. 2 a and Fig. 2b give the resulting SEM images of the products after the phosphorization. It is obvious that the phosphatized sample inherits the initial morphology of the oxide with uniform interlinking nanosheet network on the surface. The thickness of the nanosheets is about 10–30 nm, which is larger than that of NiCoO2/Ni. The increase in the thickness was caused by a high temperature annealing during the doping process of P atoms [46]. More detailed structure was obtained by the TEM images. One large dark nanosheet with the size of 400–600 nm was observed in the Fig. 2c and d, which can be attributed to the exfoliation of the nanosheet on the surface of the partially phosphatized material. The HRTEM image (Fig. 2e) displays several sets of lattice fringes. The lattice fringes with distinct interplanar distances are measured to be 0.243, 0.201, and 0.176 nm, which correspond to the (111) crystal planes of NiCoO2, the (201) crystal planes of NiCoP, and the (200) crystal planes of Ni, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2f, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern with obvious rings also matches with the (111) plane of NiCoO2, (300) plane of NiCoP, and (220) plane of Ni. Both the HRTEM image and the SAED results indicate the coexistence of NiCoP, NiCoO2, and Ni phase in nanosheets, which are also consistent with the XRD results in Fig. 3 a. The elemental mapping images in Fig. 2g clearly present the uniform distribution of Ni, Co, O, and P elements throughout the nanosheet, which is in good agreement with SEM and HRTEM results. EDS was also conducted to analyze the composition of the phosphatized sample. As shown in Fig. S2a, the elements of O and P with a specific atomic ratio of 37.49% and 18.36% were observed in the final sample. EDS data further manifested the successful formation of the partially phosphatized nickel-cobalt composites. As depicted in Figs. S2b–e, the EDS elemental mappings indicated the uniform distribution of Ni and Co elements in the nanostructure while the O element mainly distributed in the nanosheets instead of at the center of the nanostructure. The higher surface content of O atoms confirms our speculation that the Co and Ni atoms in the surface layer combined with oxygen and formed the metallic oxides. The alloy segregation of the NiCo bimetallic materials leads to more Co distributed on the surface layer while more Ni reserved at the center of the compound as the conductive matrix. The coexistence of O and P elements (Figs. S2e and S2f) indicates that the final product is a partially phosphatized nanocomposite, which is in accordance with the HRTEM results. For comparison, the detailed morphology and composition information of NiPx and CoPx are also obtained by SEM (Fig. S3). Just like the Ni–Co bimetallic system, NiPx and CoPx also inherit the morphology of the corresponding metallic oxides. The NiPx presents the 3D porous structure comprising of interconnected ligament network and rich pore voids (Figs. S3a and 3b). The nanoflowers composed of intercrossed hexagonal nanoflakes can be seen from the SEM images of CoPx in Figs. S3c and 3d [47,48]. The phase structures and constituents of the resulting sample were acquired by XRD with the corresponding standard diffraction patterns provided for comparison. The phosphated sample exhibited the poor crystallized structure and the XRD peaks were too weak to distinguish the composition. Therefore, the dealloyed sample and phosphated sample were annealed at 600 °C for 2 h under the Ar atmosphere to enhance the intensity of the XRD peaks and understand the intrinsic structure of the nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 3, all the diffraction peaks of the dealloyed sample can be well indexed to NiCoO2 (JCPDS 10-0188) and Ni (JCPDS 65-0380). The peaks at 36.8, 42.8, 61.8, 74.0, and 78.0° can be attributed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) crystal planes of NiCoO2. And the other peaks at 44.3, 51.6, and 76.1° belong to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of metallic Ni. The results are consistent with the previous reports [45]. After the phosphorization process, the resulting sample shows extra several diffraction peaks at 41.0, 44.9, 47.6, 54.4, and 75.4°, which are indexed to the (111), (201), (210), (300), and (212) planes of NiCoP (JCPDS 71-2336). The XRD results preliminarily confirm that the final nanocomposite composed of Ni, NiCoO2, and NiCoP after one-step dealloying strategy and subsequent partial phosphorization. The component of partially phosphatized samples was further examined by using the XPS technique. As shown in Fig. 3b, XPS survey scan displays the peaks of Ni 2p, Co 2p, P 2p, O 1s, and C 1s, proving the coexistence of these elements in the NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite. The high resolution spectrum of Ni in Fig. 3c comprises six subpeaks. The peaks at 861.2 eV and 856.1 eV are assigned to the satellite peaks of the Ni 2p3/2 and the oxidized Ni-POx (Ni2+) [43]. The peak located at 853.0 eV corresponds to the coexistence of metallic Ni and partially charged Niδ+ in Ni–P bonds [44]. The two peaks at 879.1 and 873.6 eV in the Ni 2p1/2 region can be attributed to the satellite peak and the oxidized Ni-POx (Ni2+). Likewise, the subpeak with binding energy at 870.3 eV is indexed to the Niδ+ and metallic Ni. As shown in Fig. 3d, the Co 2p3/2 core-level spectrum exhibits three subpeaks locating at 786.2, 781.1, and 778.3 eV, corresponding to the satellite peak, the Co2+, and the positively charged Co–P species (Coδ+) [22]. The peaks at 803.4, 797.6, and 793.3 eV are defined as satellite, oxidized Co species, and the Co–P species in the Co 2p1/2 region, respectively. The P 2p spectrum in Fig. 3e includes three peaks of P 2p3/2 at 129.3 eV from metal phosphides, P 2p1/2 at 130.0 eV from metal phosphides, and the phosphate species (P–O) at 133.6 eV because of the air exposure [43]. The O 1s spectrum in Fig. 3f includes three peaks of metal (Ni/Co)-oxygen bond (529.8 eV), O2 component (531.4 eV), and oxygen vacancy (533.0 eV) [45]. The XPS results further validate the formation of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite. Based on the experimental observations above, it is clear that NiCoO2–NiCoP nanosheets with conductive Ni matrix are successfully fabricated through the dealloying and partial phosphorization process. Specially, Ni 2p and Co 2p of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite were positively shifted in comparison with NiCoO2/Ni, which indicates the changes of electronic structure after the formation of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite [49]. The shift in the peaks position results from the partial doping of P atoms and facilitates the electron transfer in the catalytic reaction [49–52]. The core level of O element also indicates the obvious differences of the electronic structure after the partial phosphorization. Compared with NiCoO2/Ni, the atomic ratio of oxygen in metal oxygen bond decreases in NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite, while that of oxygen vacancies increases. The decrease of metal oxygen bonds is due to the formation of metal phosphides. The co-existence of metal oxygen bond and metal phosphorus bond can optimize atomic hydrogen binding energy on NiCo-based nanocomposite [50,53]. Besides, the increase of oxygen vacancies can enhance the intrinsic conductivity and electrochemical activity of materials [54,55]. The XPS analysis illustrates that the coexistence of phosphides and oxides can optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts and generates the synergistic effect between NiCoP and NiCoO2, which is beneficial for promoting the catalytic reaction kinetics of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposites. The surface areas of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposites were tested via the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The BET results indicate that NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposites have a large surface area of 95.96 m2 g−1 (Fig. S4). The large specific surface area provides sufficient active sites for the HER reaction and facilitates the catalytic performance toward the HER."
8,Electrochemical properties of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite,"3.2 Electrochemical properties of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite The catalytic activities of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite were directly evaluated in N2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte. For comparison, the similar tests of the NiPx, CoPx, NiCoO2/Ni, Ni matrix, and JM Pt/C (20 wt%) were also performed under the same condition. The LSV curves of the as-prepared samples were displayed in Fig. 4 a and the comparison of the overpotential of the NiCo-based samples corresponding to the current density of 10 mA cm−2 was presented in Fig. 4b. The commercial Pt/C shows the high HER activity with the overpotential of 37 mV. LSV curves of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni manifest its excellent catalytic activity with the low overpotential (η) of 81 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni shows the best catalytic activities with the lowest overpotential, which overperforms that of the NiPx (334 mV) and CoPx (173 mV) electrodes, indicating its superior catalytic performance toward the HER. Additionally, the NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite also presents lower initial potential than NiPx and CoPx. The overpotentials of NiCoO2/Ni and Ni matrix are 194 and 367 mV, both of which are higher than that of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni composites (81 mV). Tafel slope represents one important factor to assess the reaction kinetics for HER. The smaller Tafel slope means more preferable reaction kinetics for HER [56]. As shown in Fig. 4c, NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite presents the Tafel slope as small as 49.8 mV dec−1, which is more close to that of commercial Pt/C (33.7 mV dec−1). Compared with the NiPx (88.3 mV dec−1), CoPx (74.6 mV dec−1), NiCoO2/Ni (154.1 mV dec−1), and Ni matrix (148.3 mV dec−1), the lower Tafel slope demonstrates that NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite possesses the more rapid mass transfer kinetics for HER. The catalytic activity for HER is also affected by the electrons transport during the hydrogen evolution process. EIS tests on NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite, NiPx, CoPx, NiCoO2/Ni, and Ni matrix were further conducted at the −0.15 V (Fig. 4d). The NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite exhibits smaller semicircular arc than those of the other samples, revealing its most rapid electron transfer in hydrogen evolution reaction [57]. The EIS tests of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni, NiPx, and CoPx under different applied potentials (−0.15, −0.2, −0.25 V vs. RHE) are displayed in Fig. S5. NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite presents much smaller semicircular diameter than NiPx and CoPx at the same voltages, further confirming its better conductivity. The ECSA of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite was further evaluated in order to further understand its intrinsic activity. The C dl obtained by a series of CV tests was used to estimate the ECSA. Fig. 5 presented the CV curves of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni, NiPx, CoPx, NiCoO2/Ni, and Ni matrix at different scan rates from 40 to 200 mV s−1 in the potential range of 0–0.1 V. As shown in Fig. 5f, compared with CoPx (4.22 mF cm−2), NiPx (2.92 mF cm−2), NiCoO2/Ni (4.53 mF cm−2), and Ni matrix (3.11 mF cm−2), the higher C dl of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite (5.79 mF cm−2) implies the larger catalytic active area and more exposed active sites. It is considered that the synergistic effect between the Ni and Co components in NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni affords more effective active sites for HER [22,33]. The catalytic stability is one important parameter to evaluate the performance of the HER electrocatalyst. Both the CV and chronoamperometric measurements were employed to evaluate the catalytic durability of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite electrode. As displayed in Fig. 6 a, after 1000 CV cycles, the LSV curve of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite almost overlaps the initial shape, verifying its outstanding stability. In addition, the continuous i-t response for 30 h at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 presents a negligible decrease, providing further proof for the excellent catalytic durability of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni electrode. For comparison, the similar tests were also conducted for NiPx, CoPx, NiCoO2/Ni, and Ni matrix (Fig. 6b). As is expected, the NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite shows negligible decay of current density, suggesting its excellent catalytic durability. Moreover, contrasting with other samples, it is clearly observed that NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite shows much larger current density at the same voltage, further demonstrating its superior catalytic activity toward HER. The long-term durability of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni can be benefited from the following factors: (1) The NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni composites are quite durable. The morphology of NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni after HER test is well retained, which is revealed by the SEM image of the nanocomposites after testing 30 h (Fig. S6). (2) It is well reported that the presence of phosphorous could improve the corrosion resistance of the Ni-based electrode surface during HER [58–60]. The high corrosion resistance provides a foundation for the long-term durability. (3) The high conductivity of Ni matrix ensure the fast and continuous electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process [61]. (4) The NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni composites exhibit high adhesion to the electrode surface, which is confirmed by the unchanged weight of the electrodes before and after the catalytic test. The electrocatalytic activity of the NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni for HER was also compared with the previously reported nickel or cobalt phosphides electrocatalysts in Table S1 [19,44,62–69]. It is evident that the NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni possess outstanding HER activities with low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and superior stability. The excellent catalytic performance mainly originates from the following aspects: (1) The strong synergistic effect between Ni and Co bimetallic material, and the cooperative efforts of Ni–Co phosphorus oxides could provide new active sites and further boost the HER. (2) The conductive Ni matrix provides the guarantee for the fast electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process. (3) The rich reactive area provided by the 2D nanoflakes assembled structure could offer more active site for the HER. (4) The high corrosion resistance of the catalysts provides the structure foundation of the excellent stability. The NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite in this work offers great feasibility for potential practical applications."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, NiCoO2–NiCoP nanocomposite with conductive Ni matrix was designed and fabricated through one-step dealloying method and subsequent partial phosphorization under mild conditions. The synergistic effect in NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite is beneficial for generating abundant active sites and the conductive Ni matrix facilitates the fast electrons transfer for the HER in alkaline media. The specific composition and unique nanosheet network architecture with conductive matrix endow the NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni with the dramatically improved electrocatalytic performances toward HER, in terms of low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and excellent stability in alkaline media. With the advantages of easy preparation, good reproducibility, and outstanding catalytic performance, the as-fabricated NiCoO2–NiCoP/Ni nanocomposite holds encouraging application potential for HER direction."
