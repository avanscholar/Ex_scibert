0,Introduction,"Continuous increase in the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to rapid urbanization, industrialization, and high consumption of fossil fuels has direct negative effects on the environment like global warming, change in climate pattern, increase in surface temperature and sea level, etc. Before the industrial revolution, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was found to be ∼270 ppm, but now the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing drastically by ∼3 ppm yearly and the current level of CO2 is 414.39 ppm (As of 15th March 2021) [1]. In 2018, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was around 33,513 metric tonnes (Mt), the three major contributing non-renewable resources for CO2 emissions are coal (14,766 Mt CO2), natural gas (7104 Mt CO2), oil (11,415 Mt CO2) and others resources (228 Mt CO2). The current level of CO2 is 1.633 % higher than the level of CO2 found in the 1900s (20,516 Mt CO2) [2]. The Paris climate agreement in 2016 to reduce global warming by 2 °C made a high impact among the research community to focus on the CO2 conversion into useful products. There are two possible ways to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere due to environmental and renewable concerns: (i) capturing CO2 from the atmosphere; (ii) conversion of CO2 into value-added products like methanol, ethanol, formic acid, hydrocarbons, and other value-added organics. Methods like thermocatalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, bioelectrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, are used to convert CO2 into other useful forms [3]. Among them, photoelectrocatalytic reduction is one of the best ways to overcome the negative effects with higher efficiency, low cost, and without the production of harmful by-products [4]. The pioneering work in photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction to formic acid in the aqueous electrolyte was reported by M. Halmann in 1978 [5]. In PEC, the reduction reaction takes place with the help of excited electrons which convert the carbon dioxide into solar fuels and in counterpart, the simultaneous oxidization of water molecule will take place it completes the catalytic cycle and provides the excitons required for the CO2 reduction [6,7]. The electrocatalytic and photocatalytic reduction of CO2 has few major drawbacks like low product selectivity, challenging kinetics, high overpotential, need for hole scavengers limits their performance in the CO2 reduction [8]. Photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction synergistically couples the merits of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis together and works with better efficiency [9]. The main advantage of PEC is oxidation and reduction reaction takes place in the separate chamber with detachable Nafion 117 as a proton exchange membrane (PEM) and also have few systematic advantages like independent design in electrode configurations- (i) photoanode-n-type semiconductor photoanode and metal cathode [11], (ii) photocathode with metal anode [12,13], (iii) tandem cell- n-type photoanode coupled with p-type photocathode [14,15], selectivity in electrolytes suitable for oxidation and reduction reactions, applied bias, and temperature. These factors help in the improving thermodynamics and reaction kinetics of the overall reaction. The CO2 reduction takes place in the cathodic chamber since many systems are used in the photocathode configurations but the limitation lies on the product formation due to the overpotential required to oxidize the water molecule in the counterpart that ultimately ends up in the formation of two-electron transfer products like CO and formic acid [17]. The CO2 reduction takes place in the cathodic chamber since many systems are used in the photocathode configurations but the limitation lies in the product formation due to the overpotential required to oxidize the water molecule in the counterpart that ultimately results in two-electron transfer products like CO and formic acid [17]. The n-type based photoelectrodes have a major advantage and overcome the drawback with their more viable band position for OER, which ultimately provides a greater number of excitons required to convert CO2 into methanol, ethanol and also compensates the negative cathodic potential with anode photocurrent. Methanol becomes the most important organic feedstock due to its vast application as a starting material for the production of many organic compounds like acetic acid, formaldehyde, etc. and mainly used as a fuel for transportation in fuel-cell-powered emission-free future vehicles, in which the chemical energy is converted into electrical energy [18]. Titanium dioxide, a well-explored and known n-type semiconductor with a bandgap of ∼3.2 eV. Different morphologies of TiO2 like nanosphere, a nanobelt, nanotubes, nanoflowers, etc., have been explored for different catalytic applications, among them TiO2 nanotubes prepared via anodization has major advantages like high electron mobility, high chemical stability, high surface area, and excellent photoconversion ability, but the optical absorption of TiO2 lies in the near UV region and high recombination of excitons limits their practical application [19,20]. Hence the modification of TiO2 with other materials/dopants is required to overcome these drawbacks. The modification with noble metal nanoparticles like silver, gold, platinum, ruthenium, palladium is one of the promising ways to improve their optical absorption and efficiency in photoelectrocatalytic applications [21,22]. Chengcheng Li et al. reported α-Si-TiO2-Au as a photocathode for CO2 reduction into syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) with the highest half-cell efficiency of 0.42 % at lowest onset potential 0.4 VRHE [23], Marques Mota, et al. discussed the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas (CO and H2) using Au nanoparticles immobilized on titanate nanosheets, with the faradaic efficiency ranging from 3 to 80 % under certain optimized experimental conditions [24], Gold-copper nanoalloy particles on TiO2 for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into methane with the conversion efficiency of ∼2000 μM/g of photocatalyst reported by Ştefan Neatu, et al. [25], TiO2 nanotubes modified with polydopamine and silver nanoparticles for photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into methanol with a yield of 59.5 μM cm−2 reported by J.A.L. Perini, et al. [26]. In this work, the titania nanotubes were grown via simple two-step anodization and the surface of grown nanotubes were decorated by gold nanoparticles via electrodeposition method and used as a photoanode for photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2, the methanol was found to be a major product formed and quantified by quantitative NMR (Q-NMR) spectroscopy with the internal standard method [27,28]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Anodization of titanium dioxide nanotubes,"2.1 Anodization of titanium dioxide nanotubes Anodization of titanium foil was carried out using the electrolyte mixture containing ethylene glycol, ammonium fluoride, 2 vol % water. All the experiments were performed at room temperature using commercially available Ti foil (1 × 1 cm2) as the anode and platinum wire as the cathode, and the DC voltage was applied using an Aplab DC power supply. In prior to anodization, Ti foil was ultrasonically cleaned and washed with acetone, ethanol, distilled water, and then dried under the N2 gas flow for few seconds. A two-step anodization method was used in order to avail better and uniform growth of titania nanotubes over the substrate. The first step of the anodization process was carried out at 30 V for 2 h, after 2 h the grown titania nanotubes were peeled off ultrasonically in the ethanol solution for 15 min. The peeled-off layer of titania nanotubes now behaves as a template for the titania nanotube growth over the substrate and results in better structural formation along with uniform growth. And then, the second anodization was performed at 30 V for 15 min using the same electrolyte mixture and after that, it was washed with ethanol and subjected to heat treatment at 450 °C for 1 h to convert amorphous titania into the anatase phase."
3,Electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles on titania nanotubes,"2.2 Electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles on titania nanotubes The Au@TNT was fabricated as follows (Fig. 1 ). The prepared titania nanotubes array serves as a working electrode which was subjected to the electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles in a three-electrode system with platinum and Ag/AgCl as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The deposition was carried out in the mixture containing 1 mM of HAuCl4 in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer solution as a supporting electrolyte with the pH of ∼6.7 and the potential was then applied using the origaflex potentiostat with cyclic voltammetry technique at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 to deposit the gold nanoparticle on TNT by cycling the potential from -1.25 to -0.75 V [29]. The deposition time was varied by increasing the number of redox cycles 4, 6, 8, 10 and named as 4-Au@TNT, 6-Au@TNT, 8-Au@TNT, and 10-Au@TNT respectively."
4,Photoelectrochemical studies and product quantification,"2.3 Photoelectrochemical studies and product quantification The PEC CO2 reduction was carried out in the two-compartment homemade H-type cell (Figure S1) separated with nafion-117 membrane as proton exchange membrane (PEM). A 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 0.5 M KHCO3 used as anolyte and catholyte, prior to the experiment the cathode chamber was purged with carbon dioxide gas, and the flow was continued throughout the experiment. The prepared Au nanoparticles deposited TNT (1 × 1 cm) and bare TNT, platinum foil (1 × 1 cm) and Ag/AgCl (Sat. KCl) used as photoanode, cathode, and reference electrode. The constant potential of +0.8 V and +1 V was applied between the anode and reference electrode for 2 h using Biologic SP-150 potentiostat with the chronoamperometry technique under stimulated illumination of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm− 2) using ORIEL LCS-100 solar simulator (Newport, USA). After 2 h of continuous illumination along with applied bias potential, the electrolyte from the cathode chamber was collected and taken for analysis. After 2 h of illumination, the sample collected from the cathode chamber was analyzed in liquid NMR using the 500 MHz Bruker advance system with deuterium oxide as NMR active solvent. The internal standard method was used to determine the concentration of evolved products i.e., methanol and ethanol by using 2 mM of phenol as an internal standard [28,30,31]. The concentration of the evolved product was calculated by the following eqn. (1) by integrating the peak area of the particular product. (1) I s a m p l e I s t a n d a r d = H s a m p l e H s t a n d a r d * C s a m p l e C s t a n d a r d Isample, Istandard-signal integral value of the sample and known internal standard, Hsample, Hstandard-number of protons in the sample and internal standard, Csample, Cstandard- Concentration of sample and the internal standard."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of prepared photoanode,"3.1 Characterization of prepared photoanode XRD pattern of as prepared Au nanoparticles decorated TNT and bare-TNT shown in Fig. 2 (a), it is well matched with pre-available XRD patterns of anatase TiO2, titanium, and gold. The diffraction peaks at 25.5, 48.1, 54, 55.1, and 76.2° are well matched with the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272) and indexed to their corresponding (hkl) planes of (101), (200), (105), (211), and (301). The presence of sharp and high intense peaks shows the crystalline nature of the oxide layer due to annealing at 450 °C and eventually, no other phases of TiO2 were found i.e., rutile and brookite [32]. The diffraction peaks at 35.2, 38.4,40.2, 53.4,63.04, 70.7, and 76.36° are well in agreement with the titanium metal phase (JCPDS No. 44-1294) and their corresponding planes (hkl) are (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (112) [33]. The diffraction peaks of titanium found predominantly because the oxide layer of titanium was grown via anodization over the titanium substrate and the thickness of the oxide layer/tube length is calculated from FESEM cross sectional image (Figure S2) and it is found to be around ∼0.942 μm which is comparatively 265 times lesser than the thickness of the substrate, that can be easily penetrable by X-rays. The presence of Au nanoparticles over the titania nanotubes was confirmed by the presence of diffraction peaks at 38.4° which corresponds to the major plane (111) of metallic gold and well matched with JCPDS No 01-089-3697 [34]. By comparing bare and Au@TNT spectra, there is no such evident impact on change in crystallinity, phase, and structure of TiO2 after the deposition of metallic gold nanoparticles via electrodeposition [29]. In further, the presence and distribution of gold nanoparticles on titania nanotubes were confirmed by EDAX mapping analysis. The phase analysis was further characterized and confirmed by Raman spectra, from the Fig. 2(b) shows peaks at 145.4, 197, 395.7, 516.7, and 637 cm-1 undoubtedly attributed to the characteristic active modes of anatase phase which corresponds to Eg, Eg, B1g, A1g+B1g, Eg modes and in further Raman analysis also confirmed the formation of anatase phase and no other phases were found (i.e., brookite and rutile) [35,36]. The electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles over the titania nanotubes induced the slight shift in the Raman active mode (Figure S3) peaks which are attributed to change in size, lattice disorder, or formation of defects [37] and also the decrease in the intensity indicates the improvement of electronic interaction between titania nanotubes and gold nanoparticles. The surface elemental composition and the chemical state of the prepared materials were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. Fig. 3 (a) shows the survey spectrum of 8-Au@TNT with the surface elemental composition of Ti, O, and Au. In the Au spectrum (Fig. 3(d)), the peaks at 84.06 and 87.74 eV corresponds to metallic Au with 4f5/2and 4f7/2 states, respectively. In the case of Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(b)), the two binding energies at 459.1 and 464.8 eV corresponding 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Ti4+ oxidation states. In O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3(c)) deconvoluted into two major peaks at 530.2 and 531.7 eV attributed to the lattice and surface oxygen species [38–40]. The formation of the TiO2 nanotube array was confirmed by FESEM analysis. Fig. 4 (a), clearly shows that the anodization resulted in the uniform vertical growth of nanotubes over the titanium substrate. The cross sectional and top view of bare-TNT is given in Figure S2 shows the tube has a diameter of ∼50−80 nm with the wall thickness of ∼15 nm and the tube length were found to be ∼0.942 μm (Figure S2). The presence of gold nanoparticles over tube edges and the surface of the titania nanotubes (8-Au@TNT) were confirmed and shown in Fig. 4(b, c). The distribution of Au NPs could be due to the capillary effect of the nanotubes which suppress the diffusion of chloroauric solution into nanotubes array. The particle size of the gold nanoparticles was calculated using ImageJ software and represented in the particle size histogram (Figure S6), based on that the average size of the Au nanoparticle was confirmed as ∼10 nm. The light absorption property of as prepared materials was studied using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the reflectance mode (Fig. 5 (a)). The absorption maxima of bare-TNT and Au@TNT falls on near UV region (380 nm) and after the deposition of Au nanoparticles on bare-TNT shows surface plasmon resonance around 500−700 nm range which is due to the plasmonic effect of the noble metal nanoparticles. SPR bands are a clear indication that plasmonic Au nanoparticles are formed on the bare-TNT surface. From the Tauc’s plot, the band gap of prepared materials was found to be 3.26 eV (bare-TNT), 3.23 eV (4-Au@TNT), 3.25 eV (6-Au@TNT), 3.24 eV (8-Au@TNT), and 3.24 (10-Au@TNT). After the introduction of Au nanoparticles, the band gap of the material slightly shifted towards the visible region i.e., the red shift observed after deposition of Au NPs."

8,Optimization of photoanode,"4.1 Optimization of photoanode Initially, the PEC performance of the fabricated photoanodes was studied by PEC water oxidation reaction, from that the efficient photoanode was identified and further used for photoanode driven PEC CO2 reduction. Fig. 6 (a) shows a set of linear sweep voltammetry of bare-TNT and Au@TNT with different amounts of Au under the on-off condition of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 as an electrolyte. Under the light illumination, the bare-TNT and Au@TNT show higher current density than dark, which confirms the photoresponse and water oxidation on the surface of all electrodes under light illumination. Moreover, the sharp increase and sudden drop in current density during the light on-off condition explain the quick light absorbance of the electrode and the formation of charge carriers. The photocurrent of all Au@TNT displays significantly higher than that of bare TNT indicates that the decoration of Au nanoparticles on the surface of the TNT has played a very important role in the water oxidation reaction. The higher PEC activity of Au@TNT due to improvement in the light absorbance via the SPR effect of Au nanoparticles, moreover it quenches the recombination of the electron-hole pair and enhances the interfacial charge transfer process. The effect of various amounts of Au nanoparticles decorated on the TNT in the PEC performance was also studied by varying the number of Au deposition cycles. Initially, the PEC activity of the photoanode was increasing with increasing the loading of Au and reach a maximum at 8-Au@TNT which is ∼3.5 folds higher than bare TNT, the further increase of Au leads to a reduction in the photocurrent. Figure S7 shows the photocurrent density of the TNT and Au@TNT photoanodes at +0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl and it follows the order of TNT < 4-Au@TNT < 6-Au@TNT < 10-Au@TNT < 8-Au@TNT. The higher loading of Au on TNT may cause the shielding effect during light illumination at the electrode/electrolyte interface leads to poor light absorption causes a reduction in the PEC activity. Chronoamperometric analysis (J–T) was studied for a better understanding of quick photoresponse and photoelectrochemical stability of the fabricated TNT and Au@TNT photoanodes. Fig. 6(b) shows the quick photoresponse and good stability of all the fabricated photoanodes concerning time. The Au@TNT photoanodes exhibit great enhancement compared with the bare TNT, which is in high accordance with the LSV results, indicates the fast surface oxidation kinetics and suppressed electron-hole recombination. Further, the effect of Au on TNT, in electron-hole pair recombination and interfacial charge transfer process was examined via the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Fig. 6(c) shows the PL spectra of TNT and Au@TNT excited at a wavelength of 320 nm. The intensity of the PL emission peaks directly related to the electron-hole pair recombination rate [41]. The higher PL intensity of TNT compared to Au@TNT, suggest a higher recombination rate of charge carriers than that of Au@TNT. The PL intensity follows the order of TNT > 4-Au@TNT > 6-Au@TNT > 10-Au@TNT > 8-Au@TNT, which is inverse order of PEC activity of the photoanode, which means the introduction of Au on the surface of TNT reduces the charge recombination. Among all Au@TNT, the 8-Au@TNT displays a lower rate of recombination, which explains the reason for the better performance of the 8-Au@TNT photoanode. The interfacial charge transfer kinetics of all prepared photoanodes were studied with the help of EIS measurement under illumination conditions, the arc diameter in the Nyquist plot indicates the charge transfer resistance at electrode/electrolyte interface. Fig. 6(d) depicts the Nyquist plots of the TNT and Au@TNT photoanodes, the smaller arc diameter of Au@TNT than bare-TNT indicates the efficient charge transfer process in Au@TNT photoanodes. Among them, 8-Au@TNT has the lowest RCT value, which supports the higher PEC performance of the 8-Au@TNT photoanode than others."
9,Charge transfer mechanism in Au@TNT photoanode,"4.2 Charge transfer mechanism in Au@TNT photoanode Due to the work function difference between the TiO2 and Au metal nanoparticle, upon UV region illumination, the conduction band photogenerated electron in TiO2 moves to the surface of the plasmonic Au nanoparticles [42,43]. Thus, the formation of the Schottky barrier between the TiO2 and Au traps the photogenerated electron, reduces the recombination of the charge carriers, and enhances the PEC activity of the Au@TNT photoanode. Moreover, in visible region Au nanoparticles act as a photosensitizer by generating hot electrons from the SPR excitation [44], the hot electrons are injected from the Au surface to the conduction band of TiO2, then its move to the cathode through an external circuit and involve the cathodic reduction reaction (Fig. 8 (b)). As a result, the decoration of Au on the TNT surface increased the PEC activity of the photoanode in the entire solar spectrum."
10,Photoanode driven photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction,"4.3 Photoanode driven photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction The photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction with photoanode configuration was performed in the two-compartment H-type cell separated by Nafion 117 as a proton exchange membrane, 0.5 M Na2SO4 as an anolyte, and 0.5 M KHCO3 as a catholyte (Figure S1). The optimized 8-Au@TNT was used for CO2 reduction, the reaction carried out under the continuous purging of carbon dioxide gas in the cathode chamber. Prior to the reaction, the cathode chamber was saturated with carbon dioxide gas flow with the rate of 35 mL/min for 15 min and further, the reaction was carried out under the continuous purging of carbon dioxide gas with the flow rate of 20 mL/min in the cathode chamber. The 8-Au@TNT photoanode illuminated by AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) with the two different applied bias potentials of +0.8 V and +1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 2 h, for comparison the same experiment done with bare-TNT photoanode. The synergistic effect of Au@TNT photoanode improves the overall performance of cathodic CO2 conversion by their dual role (i) Anode water oxidation- which provides the charge carriers (protons and electrons) for the CO2 reduction; (ii) Role of photovoltage- photovoltage generated at the anode compensates and induces more cathodic potential for the conversion. Throughout the reaction, the potential difference between the two electrodes is kept constant (+0.8, +1 V). From the Figure S8, the open circuit potential of bare TNT (0.104 V) and 8-Au@TNT (0.166 V) shows the generation of strong photovoltage under the illumination condition which in turn compensates the negative cathodic potential required for the CO2 reduction and easily allows the CO2 to cross over the energy barrier for the reduction and improves the conversion efficiency [45]. The charge separation efficiency reaches its maximum at optimal external bias condition, the further increase in the external bias will not influence the PEC CO2 reduction efficiency [46], In this work, we have used two different potentials +0.8 and +1 V to evaluate the PEC performance and their influence in product formation. Further, increase in the external bias to +1.2 V not influenced any changes in the CO2 reduction efficiency and product formation. After two hours of reaction under the applied bias potential with illumination condition, the samples from the cathode chamber were collected using a micro-syringe and were taken for the product analysis in NMR. Deuterium oxide (D2O) was used as an NMR solvent along with phenol as an internal standard to quantify the formed product. Figure S9 shows the standard NMR spectrum of the phenol in D2O solvent, it displays the three peaks at 7.21, 6.88, and 6.8 ppm are corresponding to meta (2 H, triplet), para (1 H, triplet), and ortho (2 H, doublet) hydrogen atoms respectively, present in the aromatic ring [47]. The NMR spectrum of the electrolyte after the PEC reaction shows the formation of methanol (3.27 ppm, singlet) in the case of bare-TNT (Fig. 7 (a–b)) used as photoanode. However, in the case of 8-Au@TNT photoanode the NMR spectra (Fig. 7(c–d)) clearly indicates the formation of methanol and ethanol (1.11 ppm, 3H, triplet; 3.59 ppm, 2H, quartet) mixture. Under illumination and applied bias, the photogenerated holes moves to the surface and oxidize the water molecules, meanwhile, electrons move to the cathode via an external circuit and react with adsorbed CO2 on the cathode surface to form * C O 2 - radical anion, upon the second protonation * C O 2 - converted into carbon monoxide. Further, the carbon monoxide undergoes CC coupling reactions and resulting the formation of alcoholic products (Fig. 8 (a)) (methanol and ethanol). The possible reaction that takes place on the anode and cathode are given in the Eqn. (2–5) [48,49]. Anode reaction: (2) 2 H 2 O → O 2 ( g a s ) + 4 H + + 4 e - Cathode reaction: (3) C O 2 + 6 H + + 6 e - → C H 3 O H + H 2 O (4) 2 C O 2 + 12 H + + 12 e - → C 2 H 5 O H + 3 H 2 O Overall reaction: (5) n C O 2 + n H 2 O + n H + + n e - → n C H 3 O H + n C 2 H 5 O H + n H 2 O The methanol and ethanol concentrations obtained from photoanode driven PEC CO2 reduction by using the bare-TNT and 8-Au@TNT were calculated from the NMR integral value by using Eqn. 1. When the bare-TNT used as a photoanode after 2 h illumination, the concentration of formed methanol was 0.17 and 0.33 mM at the applied potential of +0.8 and +1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, in this case, there is no formation of ethanol. But in the case of 8-Au@TNT photoanode, the NMR spectra confirm the formation of a mixture of methanol and ethanol. The concentration of the methanol and ethanol was 2.23 and 0.88 mM at +0.8 V, respectively. At +1 V the concentration of the methanol and ethanol was found as 5.1 and 1.4 mM, respectively. The formation of ethanol is a 12-electron transfer reaction (12 electrons-hole pairs are needed) whereas for the formation of methanol is a six-electron transfer reaction (requires 6 electrons and hole pairs). So, the formation of methanol is more feasible than the ethanol at the lower potential and current. When compared to the bare TNT, the 8-Au@TNT photoanode system effectively converted CO2 into value added products via higher PEC water oxidation process, it provides a greater number of electrons to cathode for CO2 reduction. After water oxidation assisted CO2 reduction reaction, the 8-Au@TNT electrode was taken out and washed in the distilled water, and dried in a nitrogen gas stream. And the electrode was subjected to the post characterizations to study its chemical and physical changes during the reaction. The FESEM images (Fig. 9 (a,b)) of 8-Au@TNT showed a traces of electrolyte species (Na2SO4) on the surface of Au@TNT after the 2 h reaction under illumination condition. Further it was confirmed with the XRD studies (Fig. 9(c)), the traces of Na2SO4 is reflected in the diffraction pattern, the peaks at 2θ values of 19.4, 23.5, 28.5, 29.38, 32.4, 34.3, and 49.1° corresponds to (111), (022), (131), (040), (113), (220), and (153) planes respectively, due to sodium sulphate (JCPDS no. 00-002-0838). Apart from the traces of electrolyte species no other physical changes was observed from the post studies, the above results confirmed the stability of the Au@TNT photoanode."
11,Conclusion,Gold nanoparticles decorated titania nanotubes were successfully employed as a photoanode for reduction of carbon dioxide into methanol along with the traces of ethanol under the illumination condition. The high yield of 5.1 mM of methanol with 1.4 mM of ethanol was achieved at the applied bias of +1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 2 h under illumination condition. The deposition of Au nanoparticles over the titania nanotubes improved the photo response and overall PEC efficiency. The SPR response of gold nanoparticles is major contribution via hot electron generation and injection. Gold nanoparticles on TiO2 nanotubes reduced the charge recombination and improved the charge carrier mobility which in turn improved the overall photoelectrochemical performance of Au@TNT photoanode towards water oxidation. The results suggest that Au@TNT could be a potential photoanode with high chemical and photostability for the reduction of carbon dioxide into methanol and ethanol under optimized experimental conditions.
