0,Introduction,"Air pollution with the exhaust emission continues to be a significant problem and a world there was concern raised for its power and constraint. Energy conservation with higher efficiency and lower emissions is therefore critical for the operation of the engine system. The engine which is using alternative fuels recently like coal, liquefied natural gas, diethyl ether, and hydrogen is being actively built to unravel these problems. Hydrogen has been used extensively within the space program since it has high energy to weight ratio than any fuel. Moreover, usage of fuels is rising every day which results increase in the price of fuels and emits more amount of harmful exhaust gases like CO, CO2, HC, NOX etc., The foremost suitable alternative fuel which replaces present fuel is that the alcoholic fuels, gaseous fuels. Biodiesel may be a long-term coal, sustainable and emitting less pollution than conventional fuels. Out of these, pure vegetable oil (SVOs) from the inventory of edible and non-edible oil is selected. Various researches have been made with SVOs. Index of oxidation stability (OSI) and properties of cold flow are calculated. The results found that, the OSI has been reduced when compared with SVO (castor > mahua > neem > Karanja). Out of these alternative fuels, castor oil is the best SVO to produce biodiesel. Before using biodiesel as a motor-fuel cold streaming of water properties and Biodiesel quality was associated. In this sense, the main focus is given to the cold flow property along with the Effect on engine output. Most of these air flux characteristics are responsible for solidification of fuels In lines of fuel filter which causes engine fuel starvation during service startup [1,2]. The major two problems faced by the modern world are fuel shortage and environmental Pollution. The emissions caused by large amount of industries and vehicles nowadays are affecting the atmosphere and the earth, if necessary steps are not taken to this effect, we may soon face serious problems. Hydrogen, in the recent days have been thought of as a fuel in IC engines because of its certain properties like lowest molecular weight, high infusibility etc. What appeals more is the combustion product of IC engines running on hydrogen would be ordinary water. Hydrogen, the lightest element, is a colourless, odourless, tasteless and nontoxic gas found in the air at concentrations of about 100 ppm (0.01%) and it is abundant element in nature [3]. Biodiesel is alternative fuel consist Alkyl Acid Monoesters from livestock oil and pets fat. Oxidized clean biodiesel results in 15–16% reduction of carbon monoxides and hydrocarbon. By comparing the direct injection diesel engine with emulsified and fumigated methanol running on biodiesel is found to need an extra fuel injection control system [4]. By using biodiesel like Pongamia it is observed that CO, UHC and soot emissions were reduced to a certain level simultaneously NOX have been increased due to the oxygen availability in the biodiesel [5,6]. By increasing the proportion of biodiesel, CO and HC emissions are reduced dramatically. NOX emissions for that particular case PB100 had been the highest among the entire biodiesel blend. Ternary blend density, viscosity, and calorific value of Pongamia Biodiesel (PB) and Waste Cocking Biodiesel (WCB) and diesel are more or less comparable to diesel. The BSFC is higher than higher loads than that of diesel. At 25% loading, BTE is same as compared to diesel [7]. By using methanol and raw oil a biodiesel yield is of 98.54% were achieved by Usage of the KOH as a catalyst at 56.6 °C. In addition by various investigations it is observed that The Biodiesel Pongamia has poor metal stability and cold flow properties [2,8]. In earlier times biodiesel was produced from edible oils. But this results in a negative impact on food crops and puts a pressure on the land use and availability of food products. So there is shift to Oils which are not edible and other feedstock’s For Biodiesel production. Their properties are also much better than those produced from edible oils. There is a higher scope for alcohol for biodiesel production [9]. As methanol is extracted from the fossilized oils, biofuel produce from it cannot be completely called as regenerable. The latest kinetic research shows that transesterification reactions for ethanol are slower compared to methanol and require more energy. Since, ethanol is produced from renewable feedstock’s It is a possible alternative to the transesterification of methanol [10]. The Cloud Point and Pour Point of Palm oil improved from 25.2 °C to 8.9 °C and 23.6 °C to 4.6 °C while Palm biodiesel improved from 21 °C to 7.30 °C and 19.7 °C to 4.1 °C through mixing with ethanol respectively. Puneet Verma et al.[11,12] found that PE80 fuel can be recommended for cold climatic conditions. Under conventional diesel fuel operation, it produces more amount of NOX, slightly less amount of HC and CO emission. Even by using the in-cylinder treatment and exhaust gas treatment the emissions are seems to be reduced by a little amount compared to the initial stage of combustion emission. So, by alternate fuel like hydrogen, Biodiesel may results in complete combustion and reduced exhaust emission in a large scale [13]. In RCCI mode unstable combustion that exists at the higher loads that can be controlled by giving the correct proportion of EGR fraction, methanol mass fraction and by preheating the intake air and cycle-to-cycle variation is slightly higher than the conventional mode of operation [14]. In this, Hydrogen-based engine and its accessories play a significant role in future. One in all the foremost Significant benefits of hydrogen as a combustion engine fuel are the fact that hydrogen engines produce much less and much less emissions than normal fueled IC engines. In addition production cost of hydrogen is very less when compare to refining process of diesel and gasoline. Because of its higher calorific value of hydrogen, the combustion will take place as complete combustion by supplying sufficient oxygen along with atmospheric air. Due to complete combustion and higher oxygen concentration CO2 and NOX getting emitted in the exhaust at a higher concentration [15–17]. The use of hydrogen in cars requires a significant emphasis in the research and production of electric cells. Unity in hydrogen as an alternative container fuel is predicated on its domestic output capacity, its use of zero-emission electric vehicle fuel cells. Therefore the electric cell vehicle's potential for prime efficiency. Many car manufacturers have started making light-duty fuel cell hydrogen vehicles available in the USA in selective regions like Southern and Northern California where there is access to hydrogen fueling stations. Test vehicles in few organizations with access to hydrogen fueling stations are also available in limited numbers. This will leads to create a new global market in the automotive industry."
1,Methodology,"To obtain the Performances and emission parameters of combustion of CI engine with HHO gas induction, the following steps has to be followed as shown in Fig. 1 . Initially this work started with literature survey, that helps to identify the problem exist in the conventional CI engine. From the literature survey it is found that lot of difficulties are found in various methods of hydrogen generation and its mechanisms. Hydrogen can be easily extracted by electro hydro genesis by ionizing the waste water but, separation of hydrogen from carbon dioxide is really a tough task and it needs some more expense CO2 separation. Steam electrolysis is a process which is used in large-scale processing of hydrogen. In this process the water is converted into steam and the steam is electrolyzed to extract hydrogen. This method of hydrogen generation has 90% of its efficiency but, conversion of steam from water needs high voltage electricity for ovens [18]. Finally, an easiest and safest mechanism for hydrogen generation has been finalized and also found. Electrolysis of water is a method through which hydrogen is extracted through electron decomposition. This method needs less expense compared to other methods. Also, it is a safe method to extract hydrogen from water. The main task to this is maintenance of temperature between 25 and 37 °C. Dry cell electrolysis is an easiest and more efficient method for HHO gas generation. [19,20]. Then found a better and easy way of injecting HHO gas in airstream into intake manifold. The electrolyzer has been designed as synthesized mechanism. The suitable design for the electrolyzer was planned and the planned model was developed. Then with the help of electrolyzer the HHO gas is generated from catalyzed distilled water by means of electronic decomposition. The generated HHO gas gets inducted in the inlet manifold through the inlet air-stream of a CI Engine for combustion along with diesel. The engine performance gets monitored by sensors interlinked to the ECU. The recording of performance and emission were plotted as graphs after optimizing the crank angle [21]."
2,Experimental setup,"The VCR engine which is connected with eddy current dynamometer through couplings is shown in the Fig. 3. The eddy current dynamometer is interlinked with control computer and load checker. In this a load controller of digital type has been used. The input is taken using possible method of electrical load. The smoke meter and five gas analyzer is connected with engines exhaust line and is controlled through the ball valve. The AVL 444 N Di gas Analyzer is an emission measuring device used to measure the concentration of emission (CO, CO2, HC, Particulate Matter, NOX) from the hydrogen assisted CI engine. The temperature sensors are interlinked to the computer through the electronic control module. The ECU inters links the entire testing device and its controller connected to the desktop. In this, a digital type load controller has been used. The indicator source apply load to engine in kg. 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of loads were applied step by step and The fuel consumption readings and their emission readings shall be taken. In this setup HHO gas is generated by dry cell electrolysis method is shown in the Fig. 2 , which is one of the most promising and cost effective method for hydrogen generation[19,22]. Followed by this generated HHO is feed to the engine through the intake manifold. The amount of HHO gas generation can be regulated with varying number of cell plates, concentration of electrolyte, input power and by using different electrolyte. In this study optimized HHO gas is obtained by using KaOH electrolyte at 5A and 48 V Power supply [22]."
3,Result and discussion,
4,Combustion analysis on HHO gas addition in CI engine by varying the crank angle,"4.1 Combustion analysis on HHO gas addition in CI engine by varying the crank angle In this experimental work, the combustion and emission characteristics of a CI engine were evaluated with induction of HHO gas by 10% (4 LPM) of total volume of fuel consumption at various crank angles (20°, 25°, 27°CAbTDC). The conventional evaluations were carried out under 200 bar injection pressure and 23°CAbTDC. From this study it is found that a better performance occurs at 27°CAbTDC at 75% load. The performance and combustion of an HHO gas inducted operation is observed at various engine load condition. Better performance is achieved at 75% load is shown in the Fig. 4 . In this figure it indicates smoother combustion and better performance is occurring at 27°CAbTDC when compared to other crank angle [23]."
5,Performance analysis on HHO gas addition in CI engine by varying the CA,"4.2 Performance analysis on HHO gas addition in CI engine by varying the CA The specific fuel consumption has been reduced to an considerable amount of 11.53% at 27°CAbTDC from the conventional combustion mode as shown in the Fig. 5 . This is because energy content of hydrogen is too high when compared to diesel (150000 kJ/kgK) [23]. The engine gets combusted with 10% of HHO as a supplementary fuel which results in significant increase of brake power by 6.9%, 4.28% and 11.84% at 200, 250 and 27°CAbTDC. At 27°CAbTDC the brake power has been increased to a maximum limit of 11.84% is shown in the Fig. 6 . This is because, the calorific value of hydrogen is high compared to diesel. The higher calorific value of hydrogen along with sufficient Oxygen for fuel fraction induces the improved combustion rate which results in improved performance of engine. Variation in the mechanical efficiency, brake thermal efficiency and indicated thermal efficiency with respect to different crank angle are indicated in the Table 1 and the corresponding formulas are shown in the Table 2 . Generally, these efficiencies increase when the brake power increases. The mechanical efficiency were increased by 4.62%, 4.75% and 6.83% at 20°, 25° and 27° of crank angle from the conventional mode is shown in the Fig. 7 . This is because; when brake power increases then the mechanical efficiency also increases due to better performance of diesel engine with 10% of HHO. The performance of diesel engine increases because of complete combustion occurs by sufficient O2 supply. The indicated thermal efficiency increased to maximum of 5.215% compared to the conventional mode at 27°CAbTDC is shown in the Fig. 10. At the other two crank angles increases by 3.10% and 3.32% which is greater than conventional mode was observed but, it is lower than 27°CAbTDC [15,24]. The brake thermal efficiency was increased by 0.01%, 1.37% and 4.85% at 20°, 25° and 27° CAbTDC is shown in the Fig. 8 from the conventional mode respectively. This is because the brake power of engine increased gradually. The brake power is increased because of higher calorific value of inducted hydrogen and it’s homogeneous form of fuel mixture. variation of IMEP with respect to different crank angle at different load is shown in the Fig. 9 respectively."
6,Emission analysis on HHO gas addition in CI engine at different crank angle,"4.3 Emission analysis on HHO gas addition in CI engine at different crank angle Generally, all these improvements in the diesel engine are due to the inducted 10% of HHO with the fuel fraction. The fuel fraction is replaced homogeneous to heterogeneous form at 75% of load. But, at 100% of load all the parameters indicated the poor performance of diesel engine because, the stratified condition of fuel fraction has been lost due to the loss of combustion stability. The combustion stability was poor at the overall combustion period because, the calorific value of hydrogen is too higher (150000 kJ/kg. K) than any other fuel used fine automobile engines. The CO2 has been increased by 3.01%, 3.27% and 3.41% than the conventional mode is shown in the Fig. 11 [24]. This is because the complete combustion takes place by providing sufficient oxygen supply along with hydrogen through induction. When the entire fuel fraction burns due to excess oxygen in combustion chamber converts CO into CO2. The CO has been reduced by 6.25% at 75% load from the conventional mode is shown in the Fig. 12 . This is because; remaining oxygen in the combustion exhaust converts the CO into CO2. Hence the CO generation is interrupted highly than in the conventional mode. The CO to CO2 conversion at 20° and 25°CAbTDC were not good as 27° crank angle. This is because the combustion was not good at both 20° and 25° crank angles as 27°CAbTDC. The NOX has been increased to a maximum volume of 22.45% at 27°CAbTDC than the conventional combustion is shown in the Fig. 13 . This is because the pre mixed combustion takes place with high ignition temperature and pressure. NOX generation is higher at peak temperature. When oxygen in the fuel fraction is high, then the combustion temperature increases. Here the H2 is supplied along with oxygen through induction with fuel for combustion. Hence the NOX generation is too high. The NOX has been considerably high during the other two crank angles (20° and 25°) by 0.79% and 21.52% respectively. But the NOX at the crank angle 20° and 25° is less when compare to 27° crank angle because of quite poor combustion. The smoke has been reduced by 11.385% at 27°CAbTDC is shown in the Fig. 14 . This is because due to the presence of HHO gas the chance for formation of heterogeneous mixture gets reduced. Due to this uncontrolled combustion is reduced and simultaneously combustion duration is also higher when comparing to the conventional mode. Hence, fuel consumed to a maximum level during combustion so the smoke has been reduced to a considerable volume. Due to complete combustion unburnt fuel deposits will not stick in the combustion chamber. Also, complete combustion takes place by supplying sufficient oxygen along with supplementary fuel hydrogen. The smoke has been reduced by 4.36% and 7.59% at 20° and 25°CAbTDC."
7,Conclusions,"The hydrogen which is found abundantly in the atmosphere which is available in gas generation plant. It is unsafe to transport from one place to another. In this research diesel engine performance and emission characteristics with 10% of hydrogen gas induction was observed. The following conclusions are made. The specific fuel consumption has been reduced by 11.53% because of its higher calorific value. The brake power has been increased by 11.8% because of its complete combustion, brake thermal efficiency increased by 4.85% from the conventional mode. Mechanical efficiency increased by 6.83% along with indicated thermal efficiency. The emissions like CO, HC, and Smoke has been reduced by 6.25%, 22.22% and 11.38% at 75% load respectively with the increase of 3.41% and 22.43% of CO2 and NOX at 27°CAbTDC. All this improvement is because of higher energy content of hydrogen. Results are not quite good above 75% of applied load due to the loss in combustion stability."
