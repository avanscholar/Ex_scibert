0,Introduction,"Currently, hydrogen needs are covered for 95% with non-renewable sources [1]. Steam methane reforming is one of the main methods to produce it. Alternative ways could be used to generate H2 such as water electrolysis [2], biological photosynthesis [3] or photocatalysis [4–7]. This last one and its potential use of solar energy could be a promising way to produce clean hydrogen, moreover if water is used as the hydrogen source. At the moment, alcohols are mainly used as model feedstock with or without water to produce hydrogen via reforming reaction [4,5] or dehydrogenation reaction [4,6,7]. Methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol are often found as the best reactant to produce hydrogen via photocatalysis [7–9]. TiO2 has been extensively studied and remains the unavoidable semiconductor for photocatalysis, due to its low-cost, non-toxicity and photostability. One of its limit is its absorption band gap energy between 3.0 eV and 3.2 eV, depending of crystallographic phases in presence [10–12], which may only absorb wavelength light with under 400 nm in the UV light range. Composite materials of various semiconductors are one way to improve photogenerated charge separation in the material [13–15]. A bifunctionnal reaction mechanism for photocatalytic alcohol dehydrogenation has been proposed [7,16] needing a photocatalyst (TiO2) and a metallic cocatalyst deposited onto the surface of the catalyst. The semiconductor absorbs photon with energy higher than its band gap. Photogenerated electron migrates to the cocatalyst to be able to reduce protons into hydrogen atom, while photogenerated holes oxidize alcohol molecules into aldehyde or ketone molecules, depending of the alcohol. Platinum is known to be one of the best cocatalyst with a minimal loading, for hydrogen production [5,17]. Platinum particle deposit could be performed via various methods such as photodeposition, incipient wetness impregnation or chemical reduction [15,18]. One way of using hydrogen is its electrochemical conversion into electricity and heat in a fuel cell as Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). Indeed, PEMFC is an attractive power source, but a key issue for its industrial development is the production, storage and distribution of hydrogen. The possible pathway to directly use the hydrogen produced by photocatalysis in a PEM fuel cell is an important issue to face application for hydrogen production via photocatalysis. This type of coupling is in the scope of the development of energy supply for the future by combining different environmentally friendly power productions. He and al. have performed similar coupling set up using hydrogen production from a photobiological reactor [19], for which 80 mA current was maintained for 40 h corresponding to a current density of 5.0 mA cm−2. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the possibility to use the photocatalytic hydrogen production without further purification directly in a PEMFC. Different platinum loadings on TiO2 photocatalyst and different alcohols were in particular studied by measuring the PEMFC performances."
1,Experimental,"The experimental setup for the photocatalytic hydrogen production and its use in the PEMFC is shown in Fig. 1 . The photoreactor consists in a Pyrex cylinder with a direct optical surface of 91 cm2. The reactor and the pump contain 300 ml of alcohol. TiO2 (Aeroxide TiO2 P25) nanoparticles are maintained in suspension in alcohol (1.0 g L−1 of catalyst in alcohol). The Pt/TiO2 catalyst was prepared via direct photodeposition of hexachloroplatinate acid (Sigma–Aldrich, H2PtCl6, 6H2O) during the experiment. Hexachloroplatinate acid is added in concentration adjusted to obtain 0.1 wt%, 0.3 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, 4 wt% deposited onto TiO2. Platinum reduction occurred during the irradiation of the catalyst solution. Pt content optimization was done for methanol dehydrogenation. The pump permits a sufficient stirring of the mixture catalyst/alcohol by the recirculation circuit to homogenize the suspension. UVA-lamp was a Phillips 15 W Cleo compact. The photon flux irradiation was measured at 114 μmol s−1 m−2 for wavelength range between 300 nm and 400 nm. Aluminium shots were used around the reactor to optimize irradiation of the slurry. The equivalent photon flux directly received by the optical surface area of the photoreactor is 228 μmol s−1 m−2 corresponding to 6 mW cm−2. Methanol (Fisher Chemical, 99.99%), ethanol (Carlo ERBA, 99.8%) and 2-propanol (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.5%) have been studied with a 1.0 wt% Pt loading. In the photoreactor, O2 was evacuated through a N2 carrier gas (N2 flow is 100 ml min−1) for 30 min for each experiment, before irradiation of the catalyst slurry. After the purge, N2 flow was kept at 20 ml min−1. The PEMFC is directly feed with the N2 flow containing hydrogen produced by photocatalysis. No pressure increase occurs in this system, the outlet gas is evacuated in the air. The PEMFC was an air-breathing fuel cell from PaxiTech. The membrane electrode assembly has an active area of 25 cm2 and contained a Nafion membrane of 50 μm thickness with Pt/C catalyst on anode and cathode side. The platinum loading of the electrode was 0.5 mg cm−2. The cell worked with air at cathode side and hydrogen at anode side. Currents and cell voltages were measured with a fuel cell electronic load (PaxiTech) connected to a computer via a picolog data logger (PicoLog1012). Healthy state of the PEMFC was followed by measuring the polarization curves under pure hydrogen (1.5 bars) produced with a small electrolyser (Paxitech)."
2,Results and discussion,"Two studies have been done with this experimental setup (Fig. 1). The first one was the determination of the optimal amount of platinum on TiO2 photocatalyst required to reach the higher hydrogen production rate. The second one was the comparison between different alcohols that could be used to produce hydrogen by photocatalysis. In both case, the photocatalytic hydrogen production was evaluated directly by measuring the PEMFC performances. The photocatalyst is composed of a catalyst (TiO2) and a co-catalyst (Pt) which permits alcohol dehydrogenation via a bifunctional mechanism. The platinum nanoparticles are deposited onto the surface of titanium dioxide nanoparticles via direct photodeposition at the beginning of each experiment. Then, the hydrogen production is divided into two steps: - The first step, when the lamp is turned on, is the platinum reduction according to Eq. (1), thanks to UV absorption on TiO2 nanoparticles: (1) PtCl 6 2 − + 2 CH 3 OH → Pt 0 + 2 CH 2 O + 4 H + + 6 Cl − - The second step, after platinum reduction, is the alcohol dehydrogenation. Alcohol dehydrogenation occurs thanks to UV absorption on TiO2 nanoparticles and to hydrogen recombination onto platinum nanoparticles. The methanol dehydrogenation is given by Eq. (2), as example: (2) CH 3 OH → CH 2 O + H 2 The hydrogen produced by phototocatalysis is directly injected in a PEMFC, without prior purification, in order to obtain the polarization curves represented by Eq. (3): (3) Δ E = U ocv − η act − η conc − R . I where ΔE is the cell voltage of the fuel cell (V), U ocv the open circuit voltage (V), η act the activation overpotential (V), η conc the concentration overpotential (V), R the ohmic resistance (Ω) and I the fuel cell current (A). Fig. 2 shows the polarization curves obtained with different amount of platinum in the slurry to evaluate the influence of the photodeposition. Fig. 3 shows the polarization curves obtained with different alcohols. In both figure, polarization curve obtained with a pure hydrogen flow (24 ml min−1) produced from water electrolysis is plotted. At the open circuit voltage (OCV), it could be observed that there is a difference between PEMFC performances under photocatalytic hydrogen production and pure hydrogen from electrolysis. PEMFC shows a better OCV (0.862 V) with pure hydrogen than with hydrogen produced from photocatalysis (0.808 V). This difference is related to the hydrogen concentration difference. If, for the electrolysis production pure hydrogen is produced, the hydrogen produced from photocatalysis is diluted in a nitrogen carrier gas and the hydrogen partial pressure reaches hardly 0.07 bars compare to 1 bar for electrolysis. The theoretical OCV is directly correlated to the hydrogen concentration by Nernst equation. Under current condition, all polarization curves show good performances before a cell voltage drop at a current depending on the photocatalytic conditions (Figs. 2 and 3). The cell voltage drop may be related to fuel starvation in gas channel. There is not enough hydrogen in the carrier gas to maintain correctly the current leading to a limit current. The limit current obtained at the cell voltage drop for each polarization curve may be related to the hydrogen consumption rate in the fuel cell according to Faraday's law Eq. (4): (4) q m = I / n F where q m is the molar hydrogen consumption rate by the fuel cell (mol s−1), I the current at the highest power obtained (A), n the number of exchanged electrons (n = 2 for hydrogen) and F the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol−1). The hydrogen consumption of the PEMFC is proportional to the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalytic reactor. In the hypothesis of a complete hydrogen conversion into the fuel cell at the limit current, hydrogen production rate of the photoreactor may be estimated. Moreover, Fig. 2 shows an increase of the limit current for Pt loading between 0.0 wt% and 1 wt% from 0 A to 0.202 A. A decrease of this current is then observed for catalyst with 2.0 wt% and 4.0 wt% Pt at 0.176 A. Thus, we obtain an optimum of the hydrogen production rate for loading between 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt%. The optimum platinum content has been given for loading between 0.2 wt% and 1.0 wt% [20,21]. Without platinum, no current could be maintained, but an OCV at 0.747 V could be maintained. This OCV reveals the presence of low hydrogen concentration (there is not enough hydrogen to maintain correctly a current in our conditions). The hydrogen production rate on TiO2 without platinum is near zero. Fig. 3 shows the performances of the PEMFC supplied by photocatalytic hydrogen for three different alcohols at 1 wt% Pt loading. The best limit current is obtained for methanol (0.202 A), while for ethanol, the limit current is just a little bit smaller (0.187 A). 2-propanol shows the lowest limit current obtained for the PEMFC (0.08 A). These different performances obtained for each alcohol become mainly from the different hydrogen production rate of each alcohol. Hydrogen consumption rate is of 3.8 mmol h−1 for methanol, 3.5 mmol h−1 for ethanol and 1.5 mmol h−1 for 2-propanol respectively. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production was often found in this range: methanol ≥ ethanol > 2-propanol. Results are in good agreement with the literature [7–9]. Methanol has three α-hydrogens on the carbon with the alcohol function when ethanol has two ones and 2-propanol has only one. The hydrogen production rate increased with the number of α-hydrogen. Thus, the hydrogen production rate is mainly dependent of the number and the availability of α-hydrogens on the carbon with the alcohol function [9]. Moreover, as shown in the insert of Fig. 3, performances of the fuel cell can be maintained without significant decrease for 1 h. The state of health and the performances of the fuel cell were checked by comparing the initial polarization curve with the polarization curve obtained after the coupling tests in Fig. 4 . These curves were performed under pure hydrogen pressure (1.5 bars). A total of 100 h of work, spread over one month, was performed. Slightly better PEMFC performances were obtained after the tests. Better electric powers for the fuel cell at the end of all experiments could be associated with a higher membrane hydration state due to a regular use of it. No permanent poisoning effects were detected for the fuel cell, nevertheless, a longer coupling experiment should be done to conclude on this point. We may found alcohols, aldehydes (or ketones), CO2, alkanes in the hydrogen produces from photocatalysis [9]. All these species could have an impact on PEM fuel cell performances for a longer coupling period."
3,Conclusions,"This study shows that it is possible to directly combine photocatalytic hydrogen production with fuel cell paving the way to new alternative energy sources. Different Platinum loading were used to produce hydrogen from alcohol dehydrogenation using various alcohols. The best result was obtain from methanol dehydrogenation with 1 wt% Pt loading on TiO2 photocatalyst. The hydrogen was diluted in a carrier gas (N2) and send to a PEMFC to directly obtain electricity. The best hydrogen consumption rate for the fuel cell was of 3.8 mmol h−1 corresponding to a current density of 8.1 mA cm−2 (0.202 A) and the best power density of 5 mW cm−2 (0.123 W). Apparently, there was no poisoning effect for the PEM fuel cell after 100 h of coupling."
