0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, which is currently much desired energy carrier, can be produced by a variety of technologies. The great potential to hydrogen is in the natural gas but high costs of its transportation tend to conduct research on its transformation into syngas e.g., by steam reforming (SR) or reaction of partial oxidation (POM). Other, very important way of industrial production of hydrogen is coal gasification. Nevertheless, this process is accompanied by the formation of undesirable tars. Our recent studies [1–3] revealed that particular tar compounds can be easily, catalytically decomposed into syngas in steam reforming (SR) (Eq. (1)) or partial oxidation (POX) (Eq. (2)) reactions. Moreover, the production of high purity hydrogen (e.g., for fuel cells application) from the catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons or coal gasification requires CO conversion in the water gas shift reaction (WGS) or via the preferential CO oxidation (PROX). The first option is commonly used in conjugation with the steam reforming of hydrocarbons, including CH4. Furthermore, WGS reaction significantly influences the hydrogen yield (Eq. (3)). One of the elementary reactions in WGS is H2O dissociation [1]. Catalytic dissociation of H2O (Eq. (4)) has been studied over iron, strontium, copper and noble metals supported on various carriers [4–7]. Due to growing demand for energy and successively rising prices of petroleum, the vision of H2O used as a fuel is currently of great interest. (1) C m H n + mH2O = mCO + (n/2 + m)H2 (2) C m H n + m/2O2 = mCO + n/2H2 (3) CO + H2O = CO2 + H2 (4) H2O = H2 + ½ O2 (5) C m H n = mC + n/2H2 An alternative method of hydrogen production from hydrocarbons is their thermal decomposition (Eq. (5)), which is accompanied by the formation of carbon deposits [8–10]. Methane can be thermally or thermocatalytically decomposed (TCD) into carbon and hydrogen [11–14] without CO or CO2 production. Hence, the need for WGS and CO2 removal is eliminated, and obtained in TCD hydrogen can be supplied directly to the fuel cells. The outstanding advantage of methane TCD is production of carbon nanomaterial, especially carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Takenaka et al. [11] have reported that the supported Ni catalyst is one of the most effective catalysts for the methane decomposition. Chai et al. [15] investigated that the size of NiO crystallites is a meaningful parameter in the formation of particular types of filamentous carbon. Methane decomposition carried out at 550 °C on the large size NiO (supported on SiO2, HZMS-5 and CeO2) lead to CNFs while the formation of multi walled CNTs was observed on the small size NiO supported on Al2O3. Methane decomposition carried out at 700 °C led to carbon nanotubes formation on all catalysts but it has also been found out that the increase of reaction temperature resulted in fast deactivation of all catalysts and the decrease of outer diameters of filamentous carbons. Besides, higher temperature favoured the formation of single walled CNTs. In general, CNFs are created at lower temperatures. CNTs are preferentially formed at higher temperatures and the reaction temperature has a great influence on their morphology [16–19]. Decomposition of hydrocarbon and dissociation of H2O are the elementary steps in steam reforming reaction [1]. If the rate of hydrocarbon decomposition to surface carbon species is higher than the rate of their suppression with H2O, the catalysts may deactivate. Studies on the relationship between carbon deposition and catalyst structure during hydrocarbon reforming over Ni-based catalysts have revealed that support modification and the size of nickel crystallite have considerable effects on carbon formation [15,20–22]. It is also well known that carbon deposition on metal supported catalyst is significantly influenced by the metal-support interaction (MSI), which is associated with the method of catalyst preparation, temperature of its calcinations and pre-treatment [23,24]. Alumina supported metal catalyst (Ni, Co, Pt, Rh, etc.), which are the catalysts of choice for SR often deactivate due to the surface coverage of zero valent metal by inert carbon [25,26] or formation of carbidic carbon, which at higher temperatures is a precursor of the graphitic carbon [27]. Moreover, formation of carbon deposits is facilitated by the acidic nature of the support [28]. The application of the support with the basic nature like ceria, zirconia or ceria–zirconia mixed oxide minimizes the risk of carbon deposition. These supports reveal self de-coking properties, which arise from their good red-ox properties and high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [29–32]. According to Trimm [27], coke formation may result from gas phase reactions involving free radical polymerization and leading to carbonaceous intermediates that condense on the catalyst surface. The addition of some oxygen source, e.g., steam, oxygen or CO2 reduces the importance of these reactions. However, some studies revealed that even on these supports a filamentous carbon is formed [33]. Studies on SR reaction of toluene and 1-methylnapthlane (selected as model compounds of coal gasification tars) over Ni/CeZrO2 revealed its good activity, high hydrogen production and good resistance to carbon deposition (especially in the case of C7H8) [1,2]. Nevertheless, the application of Ni/CeZrO2 in the industrial reactor is associated with its contact with CO and CH4 that are present in the raw gas from coal gasification in concentrations of about 50 and 5 vol.% respectively. In such case, both CO and CH4 can form carbon deposits. Sehested [34] divides carbon deposits formed during steam reforming reaction on three types: pyrolytic (formed at high temperatures in the presence of higher hydrocarbons), encapsulating (consisting of thin films of CH x or few layers of graphite covering Ni particles) and whisker (formed from higher hydrocarbons or CO above 447 °C, at low S/C ratio). Whisker carbon (filamentous) is the most destructive form of carbon deposited during steam reforming. It grows by the reaction of HC or CO at one side of nickel particle and nucleation of graphitic carbon on the other side. Chen et al. [33] studied the autothermal reforming (ATR) of isooctane on ceria–zirconia supported Ni catalysts. They observed the presence of coating and whisker carbons without encapsulating carbons on the catalysts surface. It was explained by the basicity of ceria–zirconia support. It was also found out that the growth of filamentous carbon may require not only a critical nickel particle size, but also a certain minimum number of nickel particles per unit support area. The rate of formation of filamentous carbon was found to increase with metal loading whereas the rate of formation of carbon coatings was independent of Ni loading. The present work deals with catalytic decomposition of methane and toluene over Ni/CeZrO2 which has already been studied in SR of model gasification tar compounds [1,2]. The aim of this work is to explore two issues: (i) the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon in the aspect of H2 production and types of obtained carbon deposits, and (ii) the reactivity of these deposits with H2O. Both issues are of great importance for determining the mechanisms of carbon deposits formation and their suppression during SR reaction."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis Ceria–zirconia support (CeZrO2) was supplied by RHODIA Electronics & Catalysts. Before it was used for catalysts synthesis it was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. Nickel catalyst was obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of CeZrO2 with water solution of Ni(NO3)2·2H2O. The amount of nickel nitrate was calculated so as to obtain the catalyst with the nickel loading of 10 wt.%. After impregnation, the mixture was slowly dried in two steps: at room temperature overnight and at 110 °C for 12 h. Then, the catalyst was calcined at 700 °C for 2 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area (SSA) of CeZrO2 and Ni/CeZrO2 was performed using the Sorptomatic 1800 (Carlo Erba Instrument) gas adsorption analyzer equipped in the MILESTON100 software. The specific surface areas of obtained catalysts (Ni/CeZrO2) were determined by a physical adsorption of N2 at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using the Panalytica X'Pert Pro diffractometer employing Co Kα radiation (λ = 1789 Ǻ). The crystallographic structures of the samples and Miller indices (hkl) of diffraction lines were determined using bibliographic data (JCPDS published by Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards). High resolution transmission electron microscopy studies (HRTEM) of Ni/CeZrO2 were performed on the JEOL-JEM 2011 HR apparatus associated with a top entry device and operating at 200 kV."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Studies on the H2 formation over CeZrO2 and Ni/CeZrO2 were based on the catalytic runs of hydrocarbon (CH4 and C7H8) decomposition and H2O dissociation. These tests were carried out in temperature-programmed mode (TPR) and in stationary conditions. During the TPR experiments, the temperature was increased linearly from 100 to 900 °C with the heating rate of 5 °C/min. All catalytic runs were conducted under atmospheric pressure. The total flow rate of reaction mixture was 250 ml/min and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 10,000 h−1. Before some experiments, CeZrO2 and Ni/CeZrO2 were in situ reduced in 5 vol.% H2/Ar at 700 °C for 3 h. After reduction, the catalysts were purged in flowing Ar until no H2 was detected in the gas phase. After isothermal decomposition of CH4 and C7H8, the Ni/CeZrO2 was subjected to the experiment of temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) in flowing 3 vol.% of H2O/Ar. The experiment was carried out at GHSV = 4500 h−1 with the heating rate of 5 °C/min from 120 to 900 °C. The yield of hydrogen formed during catalytic tests of hydrocarbon decomposition and H2O dissociation was calculated using Eq. (6): (6) H 2 yield = V H 2 · 100 V H 2 in [ % ] where: V H 2 is concentration of H2 detected at the reactor outlet V H 2 is concentration of H2 introduced to the reactor as HC or H2O The diffuse reflectance FT-IR measurements (DRIFTS) were carried out in situ in a temperature cell fitted with ZnSe windows and coupled to a BIO-RAD FTS 165 infrared spectrometer with KBr optics. Typically, 256 scans were taken to improve signal to noise ratio. The amount of utilized sample was 30 mg of powder. In order to eliminate surface nitrates and carbonates, catalyst sample was heated in situ at 400 °C for 2 h. The evolution of functional groups on Ni/CeZrO2 was observed in flowing 250 ppm of C7H8 in Ar. The temperature was increased from 50 to 400 °C by 50 °C. The spectra were recorded after 20 min of catalyst stabilization at each temperature in reaction mixture. The spectra of Ni/CeZrO2 in reaction mixture were referenced to the sample spectra at the same temperature in flowing Ar, discarding in this way thermal effect."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The specific surface areas (SSA), crystallographic phases (determined by the X-ray diffraction analyses, XRD) and gravimetric compositions of CeZrO2 and Ni/CeZrO2 (determined by the emission atomic spectroscopy, EAS) before experiments are presented in Table 1 . As was expected, the SSA of CeZrO2 decreased after impregnation process. The XRD analysis proved that nickel supported on CeZrO2 is in the form of NiO. The content of nickel was 9.63 wt.%."
7,Catalytic hydrocarbon decomposition,"3.2 Catalytic hydrocarbon decomposition The temperature range of CH4 and C7H8 decomposition over CeZrO2 and Ni/CeZrO2 was studied by the catalytic runs in temperature-programmed conditions (Figs. 1–3 ). Both methane and toluene are reductants; hence, these tests are in fact temperature-programmed reductions (HC-TPR, where HC is the selected hydrocarbon). 3.2.1 Decomposition of CH4 and C7H8 over CeZrO2 As shown in Fig. 1(a), the surface reduction of CeZrO2 by methane (Eq. (7)) occurs at 500 °C. The reduction of bulk CeZrO2 takes place from 580 °C. The occurrence of both reduction areas is proved by CO2 formation in the reaction of total oxidation of CH4 (Eq. (7)). This reaction utilizes ceria–zirconia oxygen (O∗(Ce4+)) and leads to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and formation of oxygen vacancies (∗(Ce3+)). This reaction also produces H2O, which in some extent can dissociate on oxygen vacancies to form gaseous H2 and oxygen, which fills up these vacancies (Eq. (8)). Nevertheless, ceria–zirconia is being continuously reduced by CH4 so that the active sites (∗) for CH4 dehydrogenation are formed. These sites are probably reduced cerium ions. Dehydrogenation of adsorbed methane manifests through the significant increase in H2 formation (Eq. (9)). Moreover, dehydrogenation produces surface carbon species (∗C) that are oxidized to CO by the mobile oxygen from ceria–zirconia. Due to high oxygen mobility within CeZrO2 structure, the oxygen that has not been utilized in the total oxidation of CH4 (Eq. (7)) can migrate to the surface and oxidize surface carbon species with simultaneous regeneration of the active sites (Eq. (10)). As is shown in Fig. 1(a), a considerable consumption of CH4 occurs from 730 °C together with the increase in CO formation. (7) CH4 + 4O∗(Ce4+) = CO2 + 2H2O + 4∗(Ce3+) (8) H2O + ∗(Ce3+) = H2 + O∗(Ce4+) (9) CH4 + ∗ = ∗C + 2H2 (10) ∗C + O∗(Ce4+) = CO + ∗ + ∗(Ce3+) Reduction of CeZrO2 with toluene (Fig. 1(b)) proceeds similarly to the reduction with the use of methane. The oxidation of toluene to CO2 and H2O by the oxygen from ceria–zirconia (Eq. (11)) is observed at 500 °C. Formation of oxygen vacancies allows the dissociation of H2O (Eq. (8)), what results in H2 formation from 530 °C. After the surface reduction of CeZrO2, the methyl group probably splits off from toluene adsorbed on Ce3+ ions (Eq. (12)). Subsequently, methyl (Eqs. (13–16)) and phenyl groups are subjected to dehydrogenation on catalyst surface. Two visible maxima of H2 desorption (at 670 and above 880 °C) may be precisely due to dehydrogenation of these two kind of surface species. The methyl group probably undergoes dehydrogenation at lower temperatures because of its low stability, while H2 formation at higher temperatures can be attributed to dehydrogenation of –C6H5 group. Surface carbon species left in this way on Ce3+ ions are oxidized to CO by the lattice oxygen from ceria–zirconia, (Eq. (9)). The amount of produced CO is closely related to the amount of oxygen stored in CeZrO2. Hence, this oxygen is limiting agent for the oxidation reactions, i.e., total oxidation of hydrocarbons (Eqs. (7) and (11)) and oxidation of surface carbon species. (11) C7H8 + 18O∗(Ce4+) = 7CO2 + 4H2O + 18∗(Ce3+) (12) C7H8 + 2∗ = ∗CH3 + ∗C6H5 (13) ∗CH3 + ∗ = ∗CH2 + ∗H (14) ∗CH2 + ∗ = ∗CH + ∗H (15) ∗CH + ∗ = ∗C + ∗H (16) ∗H + ∗H = 2∗ + H2 3.2.2 Decomposition of CH4 and C7H8 over Ni/CeZrO2 Both CH4-TPR and C7H8-TPR experiments were carried out on fresh Ni/CeZrO2, on which NiO was detected (XRD). The CH4-TPR over Ni/CeZrO2 (Fig. 2(a)) revealed that methane is oxidized to CO2 and H2O from 600 °C. This reaction consumes mainly the oxygen from nickel oxide (∗O) as presented by Eq. (17). Nevertheless, the reduction can also concern ceria–zirconia. It is because the oxygen transfer is not limited to ceria lattice but it also includes migration between ceria and supported metal [35]. Moreover, the rate of oxygen diffusion is determined by the temperature and concentration of oxygen vacancies. Formation of zero valent Ni (∗) and ceria–zirconia vacancies (∗(Ce3+)) allows dissociation of H2O (Eqs. (18) and (8) respectively), and formation of H2, which is detected in the gas phase shortly after the beginning of catalyst reduction. Metallic Ni is also the active site for CH4 dehydrogenation (Eq. (9)). Therefore, from 600 °C one can observe significant consumption of CH4 and corresponding H2 production. Left in this way surface carbon species (∗C) are partly oxidized to CO by (i) the lattice oxygen from ceria–zirconia (Eq. (10)) or (ii) the oxygen which is present on Ni (Eq. (20)) and has been previously left there by dissociating H2O (Eq. (18)). In the first case, CH4 is transformed into syngas via partial oxidation reaction (POM) (Eq. (21)). Whereas the second case is consistent with the mechanism of steam reforming (SR) reaction [1] (Eq. (22)). The production of H2 reaches its maximum at ca. 690 °C and then it decreases. The maximal consumption of CH4 is also observed at 690 °C. The surface carbon species are oxidized to CO up to 800 °C, with the maximum of CO formation at 680 °C. Therefore, it can be stated that the rate of CH4 decomposition to H2 on Ni/CeZrO2 catalyst occurs with the highest rate below 700 °C. Beside H2, methane decomposition can yield CO and/or carbon species. (17) CH4 + ∗O = CO2 + H2O + ∗ (18) H2O + ∗ = ∗O + H2 (19) CH4 + ∗ = ∗C + 2H2 (20) ∗C + ∗O = CO + 2∗ (21) CH4 + ½ O2 = CO + 2H2 (22) CH4 + H2O = CO + 3H2 The experiment of C7H8-TPR on Ni/CeZrO2 (Fig. 2(b)) revealed that toluene reduces ceria–zirconia with the maximal rate at 400 °C, whereas NiO reduction starts at 440 °C (Eq. (23)). Formation of zero valent Ni allows the occurrence of further reactions leading to H2 formation. Significant increase in H2 production observed from 440 °C arises from both C7H8 dehydrogenation and H2O dissociation. The CO comes from oxidation of carbon surface species by two kinds of active oxygen: O∗(Ce4+) and O∗. As has been explained in the case of CH4-TPR, oxidation of carbon species can proceed via POX reaction (Eq. (24)) or SR (Eq. (25)). (23) C7H8 + 18O∗ = 7CO2 + 4H2O + 18∗ (24) C7H8 + 3 ½ O2 = 7CO + 4H2 (25) C7H8 + 7H2O = 7CO + 11H2 3.2.3 Decomposition of CH4 and C7H8 over reduced Ni/CeZrO2 Fig. 3(a) presents the run of CH4 decomposition over reduced Ni/CeZrO2. The presence of zero valent Ni enables CH4 dehydrogenation even from 300 °C, so this temperature is much lower than in the case of unreduced Ni/CeZrO2 (Fig. 2(a)). The temperature of CO formation is also shifted into lower values. Just like in the case of unreduced Ni/CeZrO2, methane consumption is the highest up to 700 °C and then it decreases. Nevertheless, methane decomposition over reduced catalyst yields much more CO than on the unreduced one. It is due to the greater participation of POM reaction (Eq. (21)). This, in turn, is a result of the enhancement of oxygen migration within CeZrO2, resulting from increased amount of oxygen vacancies (during pre-reduction in H2) and strong metal-support interaction. In the case toluene (Fig. 3(b)), H2 formation over pre-reduced Ni/CeZrO2 is observed even from 220 °C. It indicates that the presence of zero valent metal (Ni0) significantly lowers the temperature of hydrocarbon dehydrogenation (preceded by its decomposition to –CH3 and –C5H6). Moreover, the comparison of C7H8 decomposition on unreduced and reduced Ni/CeZrO2 confirmed that CO2 formation at ca. 400 °C was correctly assigned to toluene oxidation by the lattice oxygen of ceria–zirconia (Eq. (23)). It turns out that catalyst pre-reduction in H2 almost exclusively concerns NiO. Therefore, despite catalysts reduction, C7H8 can be oxidized to CO2 and H2O by oxygen from CeZrO2. In contrary to toluene, which is very reactive, the lattice oxygen from ceria–zirconia does not oxidize CH4 after catalyst pre-reduction in H2 (Fig. 3(a)). High stability of CH4 also results in relatively high temperatures at which this hydrocarbon reacts with CeZrO2 or Ni/CeZrO2 (Figs. 1a and 2a). 3.2.4 H2 formation during catalytic HC decomposition Hydrogen yields during catalytic decomposition of CH4 and C7H8 over CeZrO2 and Ni/CeZrO2 (unreduced and reduced) carried out in temperature-programmed mode are presented in Fig. 4 . A comparison of these results clearly indicates that the highest H2 production was obtained from CH4 on reduced Ni/CeZrO2. However, as has already been mentioned before, on reduced catalyst CH4 undergoes not only decomposition to H2 and carbon deposit but it is also converted to CO and H2 in POM reaction. In the case of unreduced Ni/CeZrO2, methane can be additionally converted to CO and H2 in SR reaction due to the presence of H2O, which is coming from the reaction of CH4 total oxidation. The maximal H2 yield obtained from CH4 decomposition on unreduced Ni/CeZrO2 (observed at 700 °C) is lower than on reduced catalyst only by 10%. That difference probably arises from the lesser amount of Ni0 active sites on unreduced catalyst. Next, the difference in H2 yield on both catalysts increases because the unreduced catalyst deactivates due to surface coverage by carbon deposits. It suggests that the pre-reduction in H2 activates the catalyst so it is more stable during CH4 decomposition. In the case of C7H8 decomposition, much more H2 is produced on unreduced catalyst. Since toluene is very reactive it easily undergoes oxidation to CO2 and H2O on ceria–zirconia and NiO, permitting the same SR occurrence on already reduced nickel."
8,DRIFTS of Ni/CeZrO2 in C7H8,"3.3 DRIFTS of Ni/CeZrO2 in C7H8 DRIFT spectra of Ni/CeZrO2 in flowing 0.25 vol.% of C7H8/Ar in the temperature range form 50–400 °C are shown in Fig. 5 . The spectrum of catalyst surface during toluene adsorption at 50 °C shows typical bands of aromatic C–H stretching vibrations (3068 and 3030 cm−1). Overtones of bending C–H in aromatic ring that occur in the 2000–1700 cm−1 region correspond to the mono substituted benzene. The stretching vibrations of conjugated CC in the aromatic ring are observed at 1599, 1486 and 1442 cm−1. The bands of out of plane bending C–H are observed at 727 cm−1. The absorptions of the alkyl group are visible at 2933 (ν as(CH)) and 2880 cm−1 (ν s(CH)) [36]. The bands around 3600 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of the ceria hydroxyl groups [37]. From 200 °C it is observed that the intensities of absorptions at 1599 and 1293 cm−1 increase and these bands can be assigned to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of surface bidentate carbonates [37,38]. The presence of surface carbonates can be due to adsorption of CO2 produced during oxidation of strongly adsorbed toluene by the oxygen from ceria–zirconia, Eq. (11). According to Jacobs et al. [39], bands at 2933, 2845, 2723, 1550, 1542, 1371 and 1362 cm−1 can correspond to bidentate formates. Whereas Arranda et al. [40] have detected surface bidentate formates (ν(COO)) that were produced during partial oxidation of naphthalene over CeO2 by the bands at 1540, 1570 and 1368–1400 cm−1. Generally, the bands corresponding to the stretching vibration modes of O–C–O group of carbonate and formate species occur in 1600–1200 cm−1 region, so the overlap of these bands complicates noticeably the interpretation of presented spectra. In the present case, the formation of surface carbonates and formates probably arises from the oxidation of methyl group, which can easily split off from toluene. The decrease of 3600 cm−1 band indicates the consumption of OH groups during the creation of formate species [41]. Beside oxidation to CO2 and H2O, toluene can also go through the reaction of mild oxidation to oxygenates (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids), which may undergo dimerization. The presence of bands at 1809, 1206 and 1173 cm−1 coming from ν(CO), ν as(C–O) and ν s(C–O) respectively, indicates that mild oxidation of toluene can yield organic carbonates [36,38], phthalic anhydride or quinine [40]. The occurrence of the shoulder at 1663 cm−1 coming from ν(CO) suggests formation of benzoquinone [42]. Moreover, the band at 2740 cm−1 (typical for aldehydes) and mentioned above shoulder at 1663 cm−1, may be due to formation of benzaldehyde [43]. According to Busca [43], toluene is activated on the catalyst surface to benzyl species, which subsequently reacts with the surface of the catalysts giving benzaldehyde, which is then oxidized to carboxylate species (e.g., formates). The doublet at 1954 and 1916 cm−1 that is observed from 250 °C, can be assigned to the bridged carbonyl structure. In this case CO is bonded on two or more surface metal atoms and can form bridged-bonded or multicentered species (Ni x –CO, x > 1). Two assignments can be proposed regarding the band at 2115 cm−1, which is observed at 250 °C and its intensity increases with temperature. The first assignment concerns stretching vibrations of a carbonyl species formed on Ce3+ site by the reduction of carbonate species [37], whereas the second can apply to the linear CO species bonded to one Ni atom (Ni–CO) [38,44]. Eischens and co-workers (cited in [38]) observed that bridged carbonyls are formed on the more active sites, while the linear carbon monoxide species are produced on less active sites, which are filled secondly. As has been explained earlier in this paper, the formation of CO on unreduced Ni/CeZrO2 (Fig. 2(b)) from 440 to 500 °C arises from the steam reforming reaction, (Eq. (25)), which occurs on zero valent Ni and utilizes H2O produced during NiO reduction with C7H8 (Eqs. (23), (18) and (20)). DRIFTS of Ni/CeZrO2 in the atmosphere of toluene has proved that it dissociatively adsorbs on zero valent Ni and formed in this way surface carbon species deposited on Ni react with active oxygen coming from H2O dissociation. This surface reaction between ∗C and ∗O occurs even at 250 °C. In order to find the stability of particular functional groups formed on Ni/CeZrO2 during the exposure to toluene an additional experiment has been conducted (Fig. 6 ). First Ni/CeZrO2 has been exposed to 0.25 vol.% of C7H8/Ar for 30 min. Then the catalyst was purged with Ar for another 30 min. Finally, the catalyst sample was treated with 4 vol.% of H2O/Ar for 30 min too. All experiments were carried out at 400 °C. DRIFTS of Ni/CeZrO2 surface were collected just after each step in flowing Ar. The characteristic bands of toluene visible in Fig. 6(A) indicate that some part of this hydrocarbon adsorbs on Ni/CeZrO2. Except that, toluene undergoes mild and total oxidation to oxygen containing organic compounds and CO2/H2O, what has been proven earlier in this section. The characteristic bands of toluene (e.g., at 3030, 2933, 2880 and 727 cm−1) disappear after purging in Ar (Fig. 6(B)), which indicates that physisorbed toluene has desorbed. Bands that were previously assigned to carbonates, oxygenates and CO species are still detected, which proves their stability at 400 °C. The bands at 3068 and 1599 cm−1 corresponding respectively to ν(C–H) and ν(CC) in the aromatic ring are still observed on Ni/CeZrO2 surface what indicates polycondensation of aromatic rings. The result of this experiment proves the split off of the methyl group and polycondensation of phenyl groups on the catalyst surface. Because methyl group is very reactive, it undergoes (i) oxidation to CO2 and H2O on the metal oxide active sites or (ii) dehydrogenation on zero valent Ni. Carbon species left on catalyst surface after dehydrogenation can be oxidized to CO. Hence, the presence of band assigned to CO species adsorbed on zero valent Ni. It can be suspected that surface carbonates and formates that are detected on Ni/CeZrO2 in particular originate from the methyl group. The intensity of bands coming from νas(C–H) and ν(CC) (at 3068, 1599, 1480 and 1440 cm−1) decrease drastically after Ni/CeZrO2 exposure to 4 vol.% of H2O/Ar (Fig. 6(C)). It indicates that tarry compounds (C) formed on catalyst surface via polycondensation of aromatic rings are gasified with H2O (Eq. (25)). Moreover, the disappearance of bands assigned to surface oxygenate species (1954, 1809, 1663 and 1173 cm−1) proves that these species also react with H2O and are converted into CO and H2 in steam reforming reaction. The decrease of intensity of bands at 1599 and 1290 cm−1 that were assigned to bidentate carbonates proves that these species also react with H2O. According to Faria et al. [45], carbonate species are decomposed on the surface of ceria–zirconia to yield steam reforming products and restoring the oxygen from the support (Eq. (27)). The presence of surface formate species is proved by the absorptions at 1558, 1373 and 1238 cm−1. (26) C + H2O = CO + H2 (27) CO3 2− + CeO2−x + H2O = CO x + H2 + CeO2"
9,HR TEM,"3.4 HR TEM The temperature range of methane and toluene decomposition over Ni/CeZrO2 has been determined by HC-TPR experiments. On the basis of obtained results, the catalyst was exposed to each hydrocarbon (i.e., 2 vol.% of CH4/Ar and 0.25 vol.% of C7H8/Ar) at 650 °C for 5 h. Next, the sample was cooled down to RT in flowing Ar and characterized by HR TEM. The catalyst samples after isothermal CH4 and C7H8 decomposition will be hereafter denoted Ni/CeZrO2(CH4) and Ni/CeZrO2(C7H8) respectively. The images of Ni/CeZrO2 after the exposure to both hydrocarbons are presented in Fig. 7 . As is shown, decomposition of each hydrocarbon results in different form of carbon deposits. Decomposition of CH4 (Fig. 7(a)) yields multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), whereas decomposition of C7H8 (Fig. 7(b)) leads to the pyrolytic carbon. The length of obtained CNTs varies from 100 nm to 2 μm. They reveal different structures – some of them are rather straight and some are spaghetti-like. The external diameter of these CNTs varies from approx. 5–20 nm, with the channel diameter up to 10 nm. The quality of TEM images does not permit to determine the number of walls in obtained CNTs. Nevertheless, it was observed that these CNTs are in particular open. Moreover, there are also catalyst particles visible inside CNTs channels. The dark points and areas visible in Fig. 7(a) are the particles of Ni/CeZrO2. TEM image of Ni/CeZrO2(C7H8) confirms the conclusions reached from DRIFTS, i.e., the polycondensation of aromatic rings. Before and after hydrocarbon decomposition the catalyst sample has been weight in order to determine mass increment. Methane and toluene decomposition gave approximately 8.6 and 8.1% of the mass gain respectively. The experiments of HC decomposition were carried out at the same temperature, using the same amount of catalyst and similar amount of introduced carbon. The time of catalyst residence in CH4/Ar and C7H8/Ar was also the same. Hence, the similar mass gain obtained from CH4 and C7H8 decomposition indicates that despite formation of different types of carbon deposits, the rate of carbon deposition was similar for both hydrocarbons."
10,Hydrogen production via H2O dissociation,"3.5 Hydrogen production via H2O dissociation Hydrogen yield during the experiments of H2O dissociation over Ni/CeZrO2(CH4) and Ni/CeZrO2(C7H8) is presented in Fig. 8 . No H2 has been detected up to 300 °C for Ni/CeZrO2(CH4) and up to 260 °C in the case of Ni/CeZrO2(C7H8). Above these temperatures, a minimal amount of H2 is formed and it increases successively with temperature. A considerable H2 formation is observed only from 430 and 480 °C for the catalysts spent in C7H8 and CH4 respectively. It indicates that the pyrolytic carbon is more reactive with H2O than CNTs. Beside H2, the gasification of carbon deposits yields CO (Eqs. (26)) and CO2 which is a consequence of WGS reaction (Eq. (3)). The issue of the selectivity of this process to CO and CO2 is strictly related to the temperature of reaction and the contact time (t c). This question will be discussed in the next paper. The TPSR experiments revealed that H2O conversion to H2 (corresponding to H2 yield) reaches almost 100% from 550 °C for both Ni/CeZrO2(CH4) and Ni/CeZrO2(C7H8). For that reason, new samples of Ni/CeZrO2(CH4) and Ni/CeZrO2(C7H8) were subjected to 3 vol.% of H2O/Ar at 550 °C. As is presented in Fig. 9 , H2 yield has maintained about 100% for almost 115 min of the test run over Ni/CeZrO2(CH4) and 97% for 110 min over Ni/CeZrO2(C7H8). Such high H2O conversion is caused by gasification of CNTs and pyrolytic carbon. Hence, one can conclude that both types of carbon deposits are very reactive with H2O. After gasification of carbon deposits, the formation of H2 drastically decreases and subsequently shows slightly descending trend. H2O decomposition over CNTs shows linear decrease in H2 formation between 115 and 145 min of the test run, whereas the decrease in H2 formation over Ni/CeZrO2(C7H8) slows down between 140 and 190 min. It can be due to gasification of the pyrolytic carbon being in strong interaction with supported nickel. The next reaction that occurs on the catalyst surface in flowing H2O/Ar after the removal of carbon deposits is the oxidation of Ni to NiO (Eq. (18)). In order to prove the ability of zero valent Ni to dissociate H2O this experiment has been performed on Ni/CeZrO2 pre-reduced in situ in H2. As is presented in Fig. 9, H2 yield is very low in this case and maximally reaches 0.35%. Nevertheless, results of this experiment clearly indicate that H2O can dissociate on reduced Ni/CeZrO2. Dissociation of H2O does not occur only on zero valent Ni (∗) (Eq. (18)) but also on ceria–zirconia vacancies (∗(Ce3+)) (Eq. (8)). Hence, the experiment Of H2O dissociation at 550 °C has been carried out on both unreduced and reduced CeZrO2. In case of unreduced CeZrO2, no H2 has been detected, despite several experiments additionally carried out at few different temperatures between 400 and 900 °C. The pretreatment of CeZrO2 in H2 caused the increase in the number of oxygen vacancies, which enhanced the capacity of CeZrO2 to dissociate H2O. It was reported by Zhou et al. [46] that (100) surfaces of ceria are reduced preferentially but the reduction pertains to 25% of the surface oxygen. A correlation between reducibility of ceria and its specific surface area shown that the percentage of removable oxygen (considered as a surface species) increases with increasing SSA. Studied in the present work ceria–zirconia characterizes with high SSA so it is rich in reactive oxygen, which easily reacts with hydrocarbons adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The replenishment of this oxygen is also very easy during H2O treatment. It can be observed in Fig. 9 that oxygen vacancies in ceria–zirconia have been immediately filled with oxygen from dissociating H2O (Eq. (8)). In the second minute of test run, H2 yield reaches 98%, whereas 3 min later the catalyst is saturated with O2 what precludes H2O dissociation. Experiments of H2O dissociation carried out over pre-reduced CeZrO2 and Ni/CeZrO2 indicate that both of them are able to proceed to this reaction. The dissociation of H2O is limited by the number of active sites (vacancies or zero valent metal) and stops when these sites are saturated with oxygen. Thus, this is not a catalytic cycle because the active sites cannot be restored. In the case of SR or WGS reactions, the presence of reagents such as hydrocarbon or CO enhances formation of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, such reductive environment stabilizes zero valent metal, which also plays important role in the dissociation of H2O. The formation of vacancies via desorption of oxygen from ceria–zirconia surface also cannot be excluded, however it has not been observed in our studies."
11,XRD of Ni/CeZrO2 after catalytic runs,"3.6 XRD of Ni/CeZrO2 after catalytic runs XRD characteristics of Ni/CeZrO2 after the individual experiments are shown in Fig. 10 . Typical reflexes of CeZrO2 solid solution on the XRD pattern of fresh catalyst (Fig. 10(A)) are observed at 2θ = 34.1°, 57.4°, 68.2°, 85.2°, 95.3° and 98.3°. The reflexes of NiO are detected at 43.9°, 51°, 75.6°, and 91°. It can be observed in Fig. 10(B) that H2 treatment caused reduction of NiO to Ni (lines at 52.5° and 61.9°). Reduction of NiO to Ni is also clearly visible on XRD patterns (Fig. 10(C and D)) of the catalyst after methane and toluene decomposition in isothermal conditions. As was expected, the experiment of isothermal H2O dissociation over Ni/CeZrO2(CH4) and Ni/CeZrO2(C7H8) resulted in re-oxidation of Ni to NiO."
12,Conclusions,"Results of our studies proved that catalytic decomposition of selected hydrocarbons (CH4, C7H8) on CeZrO2 and Ni/CeZrO2 yields H2 and carbon deposits. Nevertheless, these products require formation of reduced sites on the catalyst surface. Reaction of hydrocarbon with oxidized CeZrO2 or NiO supported on CeZrO2 yields CO2 and H2O. After formation of oxygen vacancies in CeZrO2 or NiO reduction to Ni, hydrocarbon can be converted to H2 and carbon deposit and/or CO in the case of POX, due to the presence of mobile oxygen in ceria–zirconia, and SR, caused by the presence of H2O, which is coming from hydrocarbon oxidation. Methane decomposition over Ni/CeZrO2 leads to CNTs, whereas decomposition of toluene produces pyrolytic carbon. DRIFTS revealed that this kind of carbon deposit is formed in the reaction of polycondensation of aromatic rings on the catalyst surface. First, the methyl group splits off from adsorbed toluene and undergoes oxidation to CO2 and H2O. The phenyl group, which is less reactive, can be oxidized to oxygenate or can form the above-mentioned carbon deposits. CNTs and pyrolytic carbon were found to be very reactive with H2O, which can be caused by their activation by ceria–zirconia. Hence, one can conclude that CeZrO2 facilitates the suppression of carbon deposits by H2O during steam reforming reaction. Presented results have also shown that there are two essential types of active sites for steam reforming reaction: (i) zero valent metal, on which H2O dissociates and hydrocarbon dehydrogenates and (ii) vacancies of ceria–zirconia, responsible for dissociation of H2O. The presence of the latter enhances H2 production and plays important role in preventing carbon deposition and further deactivation of catalyst due to continuous delivery of oxygen."
