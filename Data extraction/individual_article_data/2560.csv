0,Introduction,"Anaerobic digestion is widely accepted and used in the biologic treatment of wastewater in Brazil due to favorable weather conditions (tropical climate), low implementation and operation costs, low energy consumption, little generation of biologic sludge, and good tolerance to high organic loads [1]. In addition to contributing to the biological treatment of residual water, this technology may also help generate hydrogen while degrading the biodegradable fraction of organic residues, interrupting the process at the acidogenic phase (methanogenesis inhibition). In regard to energy production, the use of hydrogen is more advantageous than conventional fossil fuels for several reasons, including: the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen produces only water vapor; combustion of hydrogen in vehicles is 50% more efficient than gasoline; and hydrogen has a high energy density (122 kJ g−1), or 2.75 times more energy than any hydrocarbon [2]. In addition, hydrogen may be used as a reagent to produce low molecular weight compounds and to saturate compounds in order to crack hydrocarbons, remove sulfur and nitrogen compounds, or remove traces of oxygen. It can also be used to prevent oxidation and corrosion or as rocket fuel [3]. Many factors must be taken into account to maximize and stabilize fermentative hydrogen production, including the inoculum enrichment method, reactor start-up, support medium selection, cultivation medium composition, and operational reactor parameters. Inoculum enrichment is very important because the selection of microorganisms determines the metabolic path of fermentation, which may in turn affect the start-up, global efficiency, and system stability for continuous hydrogen production [4,5]. The methods most commonly employed to enrich inoculums are thermal shock [5,6] and acid shock [7,8]. Among these methods, thermal treatments have been shown to yield the best performance and highest H2-production rates [8–10]. Thermally treating inoculums eliminates non-sporulated hydrogen-consuming microorganisms, such as methanogenic microorganisms, and promotes the germination of Clostridia species, the most common microorganisms in H2-producing systems [5,10,11]. In addition, Clostridia species are the most promising microorganisms for technological applications because of their high metabolisms and high hydrogen production [12]. Several studies have been carried out at temperatures of over 104 °C [13] and at lower temperatures of 75 °C and 85 °C [14,15], the latter studies having been designed to verify process efficiency under low energy-consuming conditions. After inoculum enrichment, the biofilm reactor start-up demands rigorous control of environmental and operational conditions and support media characteristics to develop a biofilm that is capable of producing hydrogen. The start-up of reactors may be hindered by insufficient microbial growth, stringent environmental requirements, and limited capacity of the biofilm for adhesion and fixation. These obstacles may be overcome by the adequate selection of reactor and support media, and the effective establishment of inoculum procedures and start-up strategies [16]. Nutritional, toxicological, and environmental knowledge of microorganisms that degrade wastewater to produce hydrogen have aided in defining ideal conditions for microbial proliferation. Previous studies have demonstrated that operation at low pHs associated with microbial enrichment procedures such as thermal treatments is effective for selecting H2-producing cultures [6,17–20]. During the loading process, it is necessary to control the operational parameters of the system that may affect the performance and stability of the process in terms of substrate conversion, H2 production, and the distribution of metabolites and microbial communities; these parameters include pH, substrate concentration, nutritional conditions, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and nutrient availability [4,21,22]. Hydrogen production is accompanied by the production of acetic and butyric acids, which are soluble metabolites generated during acidogenesis. These organic acids are often found in effluents, and may be employed as substrates and carbon sources in methane production [23], hydrogen production in photosynthetic reactors [24], biopolymer production [25], and in processes of removing biological nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen [26]. Among biological fixed-film reactors employed in H2 production, anaerobic fluidized-bed reactors (AFBRs) have been shown to be efficient in bench-scale tests for operation periods on the order of 50 days [27,28]. Their main advantages are that large volumes of biomass accumulate on the support medium, their ability to handle high organic loading rates (OLRs), the short HRTs required, and their satisfactory mixture characteristics. Highly mixed reactors optimize the transference of mass between the substrate and microorganisms, and favor hydrogen detachment [29–31]. Previous studies have shown difficulties in reaching high hydrogen-production rates, which were attributed to difficulties in adequately adjusting the agitation [32,33], pH [2,11,33], HRT [28,31], and inoculum enrichment [4,5]. In addition, satisfactory hydrogen yield production and stability have not yet been obtained in continuous-flow systems that use mixed cultures, probably due to inhibition caused by microbial competition. The rather low hydrogen-production rates yielded by H2-producing biological systems to date have been a challenge to their widespread use. Therefore, the main goals of this study were to evaluate the influence of several factors, including enriching the inoculum by means of thermal treatment, using expanded clay as the support medium, and altering the HRT and pH, on the stability of hydrogen and organic acids production in an anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor operated on a long-term basis."
1,Experimental design,
2,Anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR),2.1 Anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR) This study employed an AFBR made of 5 mm thick transparent acrylic. The apparatus was 190 cm tall and had an internal diameter of 5.3 cm and a total volume of 4192 cm3 (Fig. 1 ).
3,Fermentation medium,"2.2 Fermentation medium The reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater containing glucose at a concentration of 2000 mg L−1 as the only carbon source, and was supplemented with nutrients as described by Leite et al. [34]. The wastewater pH was close to 6.7 without alkali addition."
4,Inoculum and immobilization support of anaerobic biomass,"2.3 Inoculum and immobilization support of anaerobic biomass The inoculum was obtained from the anaerobic sludge of a UASB reactor that treats residual swine culture water. The sludge was submitted to thermal pre-treatment according to a methodology adapted from Kim et al. [6], consisting of pre-heating the sludge for 10 min at 90 °C, then subsequently ice-cooling it to a temperature of 25 °C. This thermal treatment eliminated methanogenic and acidogenic vegetative cells, which do not form endospores, and maintained the capacity of acidogenic cells to produce endospores, which resist unfavorable conditions. The selection was monitored according to the methods of Maintinguer et al. [35]. The study employed expanded clay pellets commonly used in gardening. These pellets were ground, washed, and sifted to grain sizes between 2.8 mm and 3.35 mm. The real density of the expanded clay was 1.5 g cm−3. Approximately 1300 g of expanded clay was introduced into the reactor, thus creating an initial fixed bed of 90 cm in depth for the immobilization of the enriched acidogenic biomass."
5,Reactor operation,"2.4 Reactor operation The bioreactor was initially operated in a batch mode for 48 h to activate the hydrogen-producing biomass. During this process, the substrate consumption by microorganisms was periodically analyzed. After the activation period, the continuous operation of the reactor began with an HRT of 8 h, decreasing stepwise to 6 h, 4 h, 2 h, and 1 h for 178 days in five experimental phases (Table 2). The reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater, with the flow rate ranging from 524 to 4192 mL h−1 and with an OLR of between 13.57 kg m−3 day−1 and 104.20 kg m−3 day−1, at 30 ± 1 °C. The total liquid flow rate in the AFBR was kept at 128 L h−1 (expansion = 30%). This flow rate produced a superficial velocity 1.30 times greater than the minimum fluidization velocity. The reactor was operated without alkali addition, and effluent pH values ranged from 3.50 to 4.39. The composition of gaseous products (H2 and CO2) and soluble metabolites (organic acids and alcohols) produced during fermentative H2 production was monitored as a function of the time in the study phases. The AFBR gas–liquid separator enabled the separate analyses of the gas and liquid fractions. A gas meter (Type TG1; Ritter Inc., Germany) was employed to measure the volumetric H2 production."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The composition of the biogas was determined by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan; equipped with a thermal conductivity detector – TCD). The carrier gas used was argon, and the column was a Carboxen 1010 Plot (30 m long with an internal diameter of 0.53 mm). Volatile organic acids were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan; equipped with a flame ionization detector – FID) with N2 as the carrier gas [36]. Alcohols were determined by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan; equipped with flame ionization detector – FID), wherein a COMBI-PAL headspace system was introduced (AOC 5000 model and HP-INNOWAX column of 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm of film thickness). The analyses of solids (total solids – TS; volatile suspended solids – VSS; and total volatile solids – TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were carried out according to Standard Methods [37]. Influent and effluent glucose concentrations were determined through the GOD-PAP enzymatic method [34]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Glucose conversion,"3.1 Glucose conversion The average glucose conversion for all process stages was greater than 90% (Fig. 2 ). At HRTs of 8 h, 6 h, 4 h, 2 h, and 1 h, glucose conversion reached 93.52%, 92.06%, 98.08%, 97.13%, and 97.57%, respectively. Working with AFBRs, Wu et al. [29] and Lin et al. [30] obtained substrate conversions of over 90% and 92–99%, respectively, for HRTs ranging from 8 h to 1 h. However, Zhang et al. [31] verified that glucose conversion decreased from 99.47% to 71.44% when HRT was decreased from 4 h to 0.5 h. The stability and high glucose conversion observed in this study may be attributed to the long periods of solid retention, a positive feature of adhered-growth systems [38]."
9,COD removal and carbon balance,"3.2 COD removal and carbon balance The effluent COD of the AFBR consisted of unconsumed glucose, soluble metabolites, e.g., organic acids, solvents, and other intermediates, and biomass detached from the support medium; each of their partial contributions is shown in Table 1 . Removal efficiencies, defined in terms of the fraction of carbon matter converted to CO2 vs. the biomass that remained attached to the support medium, ranged from 19.53% to 27.78% (Fig. 3 ). This result was compatible with the acidogenic phase of anaerobic digestion. The difference between the COD estimated from the component analyses and the analytically determined COD (Table 1) may be attributed to the presence of other metabolites that were not detected by the methodologies used in this study, such as lactic and formic acids."
10,Effect of HRT and pH on H2 production,"3.3 Effect of HRT and pH on H2 production The hydrogen yield production (HY) for the HRT of 8 h was 1.84 mol H2/mol glucose. This ratio increased to 1.95 mol H2/mol glucose for an HRT of 6 h, and stabilized at 2.29–2.10 mol H2/mol glucose for an HRT of 2–1 h (Fig. 4 ). The hydrogen-production rate (HPR) and hydrogen yield production increased significantly when the HRT was decreased, with a maximum HPR value of 1.15 L h−1 L−1 for an HRT of 1 h, and a maximum HY value of 2.29 mol H2/mol glucose for an HRT of 2 h (Fig. 4). The hydrogen-production rate increased slightly when the HRT was decreased from 8 h to 4 h. It then almost doubled for an HRT of 2 h compared to an HRT of 4 h (Fig. 4). A significant increase was again observed for an HRT of 1 h, which was related to the increased organic load and high biomass growth. This may indicate a change in the metabolic flow during the HRT transition from 8 h to 1 h, in which most of the substrate was channeled to final product reactions instead of bacterial growth and maintenance, thus leading to an increase in hydrogen production [31]. The biogas was composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide in all of the experimental phases; their respective percentages are shown in Fig. 5 . No methane was found in the biogas. Similarly, Gavala et al. [38] obtained a maximum H2 percentage of 37% in an anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor operated at an HRT of 2 h under mesophilic conditions. A decrease in this percentage was observed when the HRT decreased from 2 h to 1 h, which was similar to reports by Wu et al. [29] and Zhang et al. [31] in AFBRs, and Gavala et al. [38] in a UASB, with the HRT decreasing from 2 h to 1 h, 4 h to 0.5 h, and 12 h to 2 h, respectively. Wu et al. [29] confirmed the hypothesis that some negative effects may result from excessively decreasing the HRT, proving that hydrogen production could be restored through thermal treatment of the culture and increasing the hydrogen content from 28% to 38%. Some studies employing 1–2 h HRTs have shown optimum HPR and HY values [28,31], which were attributed to the high flow effect washing away non-sporulated, methanogenic microorganisms [13]. The minimum HRT needed to maintain specific hydrogen production from glucose conversion is related to maintaining adequate concentrations of H2-producing microorganisms in the system. The main differences between this research and the other studies referenced herein are the suggestion that acidogenic populations must be maintained, and that contamination of the system by non-H2-producing organisms, which compete for substrate, must be prevented. The effluent pH for each operation phase showed maximum and minimum values of 4.39 and 3.5, respectively, remaining stable at 3.8 most of the time (Fig. 6 ). The influent wastewater pH values generally remained close to 6. Occasional pH values below 5.0 were due to acidification in the influent wastewater storage tank; however, they did not affect the effluent pH or the hydrogen-production rate. The H2 production obtained in this study (Fig. 4) was similar to that obtained by Zhang et al. [31] at pHs less than 4.0, and to results obtained by Wu et al. [29] and Lin et al. [30] under pH conditions between 6.0 and 7.0, which are regarded as favoring hydrogen production [39]. Several studies have employed alkalinizing compounds, e.g., ammonia bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate, to guarantee that the effluent pH remained within 6.0 and 7.0 [9,14,29,30,40,41]. In other studies, with insufficient alkali addition, the pH values fell below 5.0 [9,34,41], which, according to the authors, was the cause of lower hydrogen yield production. Mohan et al. [41] observed that a pH decrease from 6.0 to 4.5 promoted the performance of acidogenic bacteria while inhibiting the activity of methanogenic archaea. The results obtained in this study point to the potential use of H2 production at low wastewater pH. However, it is necessary to consider the importance of pH in hydrogen production, because of the effect of low pH values on hydrogenesis activity and metabolic routes [39]. It is possible that the pH in the inner biofilm layers, where acidogenic hydrogen-producing bacteria are present, is higher than in outer regions where the pHs are acidic. Therefore, this study indicates that further research is needed to map a pH profile across the acidogenic biofilm layers. In general, the soluble metabolites found in the AFBR effluent were butyric acid, acetic acid, and ethanol (Table 2 ). The absence of propionate during reactor operation is associated with improving hydrogen yield production, since propionate production consumes 2 mol of hydrogen for every 2 mol of propionate produced (Eq. (1)); its absence may be attributed to low pH values as well [31]. (1) C6H12O6 + 2H2 → 2CH3CH2COOH + 2H2O Fang and Liu [39] demonstrated that effluents of systems operated with pH values close to those used in this research contained mainly butyric acid (41.4%) and acetic acid (15.3%). Zhang et al. [31], who also employed glucose as a substrate, attested to the dominance of acetic acid (43–46%) of all soluble metabolites over butyric acid (20–31%) and reported significant ethanol production in the effluent (14–21%). Terracino and Kashket [42] and Grupe and Gottschalk [43] also reported high solvent production. Khanal et al. [13] claimed that pH may alter the hydrogen-production path, either pursuing favorable paths such as the production of hydrogen/acids, or leading to unfavorable conditions such as solvent production. The inconsistencies found in the distribution of soluble metabolites in the aforementioned studies indicate that other projects, operational parameters, and microbial populations may influence the distribution of soluble metabolites."
11,Stability of continuous H2 production by means of fermentation,"3.4 Stability of continuous H2 production by means of fermentation The AFBR in our study, operated continuously over 178 days, displayed constant hydrogen production for every HRT (Fig. 7 ) from organic acids produced by glucose fermentation (Fig. 7). The environmental and operational conditions to which the AFBR was submitted in this study – e.g., inoculum enrichment, support medium, OLR, proper liquid mixing, pH, and hydraulic retention time at each phase – contributed to the stability of hydrogen production. Expanded clay used as the immobilization medium provided high mechanical strength throughout the AFBR long-term operation. The instability found in hydrogen production in a celite R-633 AFBR by Koskinen et al. [27] was probably caused by alterations in the microbial community due to abrupt changes in operational parameters, e.g., glucose concentration and HRT, which in turn changed the production of acetate–butyrate acids to acetate–propionate acids. The authors suggested that the developed biofilm did not favor fermentative mesophilic H2 production because of H2-consuming microorganisms prevailing over H2-producing microorganisms. According to Hawkes et al. [44], the stability and durability of the immobilization system are more critical than the rate of hydrogen production. The stability of the enriched biofilm is essential to achieve stable hydrogen production [45]. The effluent in our study was mainly composed of acetic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol during all phases. Butyric acid dominated at all times except for the phase with the 4 h HRT. A positive result was observed in the production of total volatile acids when the HRT was decreased to 2 h (Fig. 7). In contrast, Lin et al. [30] observed no significant changes in the production of total organic acids or in the distribution of individualized acids when the HRT was decreased from 8.9 h to 2.2 h in a draft tube AFBR. Zhang et al. [31] verified that the concentrations of acetic and butyric acids and ethanol decreased slowly when the HRT was decreased from 2 h to 0.5 h. Yu et al. [18] reported the opposite behavior in an ascending-flow reactor when the HRT was lengthened from 4 h to 24 h; the concentration of total acids increased, but had the same distribution of individualized acids. Contrary to these studies, our system yielded significant production of individualized organic acids. The concentrations of acetic and butyric acids increased when the HRT decreased from 8 to 2 h; when the HRT was decreased to 1 h, production of these acids diminished."
12,Conclusions,"The hydrogen content in the biogas was 21.8–37.6%, and the remainder was CO2. The hydrogen content increased significantly with decreasing HRT. Butyric and acetic acids were the prevailing soluble metabolites in the reactor effluent, and their presence was conducive to H2 production from organic substrates. The operational conditions, including lack of pH control, were adequate to this path of metabolite production and to methanogenesis inhibition. Both HY and HPR increased significantly when the HRT was decreased, reaching maximum values of 2.29 mol H2/mol glucose and 1.15 L h−1 L−1, respectively. This study demonstrated that H2 may be produced commercially by means of organic substrate conversion, indicating the potential of fermentative H2-production processes. The stability of AFBRs during continuous operation over long periods of time may be guaranteed by treating the inoculum in advance, and by using the support medium and inoculum proposed in this study. The developed biofilm favored the mesophilic production of H2, since H2 producers benefited to the detriment of H2 consumers."
