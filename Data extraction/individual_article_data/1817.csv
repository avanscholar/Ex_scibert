0,Introduction,"The major component of municipal solid waste (MSW) is food waste (FW), and its management is a challenging task due to its high moisture content and rapid biodegradation (Ayilara et al., 2020). Landfilling, composting, incineration, and ocean dumping of FW are not very desirable options due to greenhouse gas emissions, low economic feasibility and stringent environmental regulations. Therefore, anaerobic digestion (AD) of FW is gaining attraction due to the energy production potential of 200–500 L of CH4kgVS−1 (Obulisamy et al., 2016). The single-stage AD process is the most frequently used technique due to its simple configuration. However, accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA), low pH and low biogas production with high organic loading rate (OLR) makes this process unstable, especially with FW as the substrate (El-Mashad et al., 2008; Climenhaga and Banks, 2008; Cheah et al., 2019). Hence two-phase AD system was developed, where leached bed reactor (LBR) coupled with a methanogenic reactor was proposed and adopted by many researchers to treat solid substrates like FW, sugar beet, fruit and vegetable waste, maize and MSW (Xu et al., 2011; Cysneiros et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014a; Yan et al., 2016; Chakraborty and Venkata Mohan, 2018). In the first stage, hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria degrade organic matter to VFA in the hydrolysis-acidogenic reactor. In the second stage, VFA are converted to acetate by acetogenic bacteria and then this acetate and hydrogen produced is converted to methane by methanogens in the methanogenic reactor. Recently the interest for adopting LBR is growing due to its operational simplicity and efficient treatment of organic wastes with high solids content (Selvam et al., 2010; Browne et al., 2013; Bayrakdar et al., 2018). The advantages of two-stage systems in comparison with a single-stage system for AD of organic waste are as follows: better process stability due to lower risk of methanogenesis inhibition by pH drop, lower total digestion time, higher methane yield and methane content in biogas (Xu et al., 2014a; Dareioti et al., 2021). Two-phase AD usually is operated in batch mode or with periodical addition of organic matter (semi-continuous) mode (Wang et al., 2003; Yan et al., 2016). There are few reports on the operation of LBR in batch mode (Xu et al., 2014b; Luo and Wong, 2019; Chakraborty and Venkata Mohan, 2019; Luo et al., 2021) which requires longer retention time and a large volume of inoculum per batch. It reduces the effective reactor volume resulting in higher operational costs (Nizami et al., 2011). However, continuous mode of LBR operation enables to obtain a regular feedstock and increases the methane yield (Xu et al., 2012). Therefore, LBR could be operated in semi-continuous or continuous mode to enhance the methanogenesis with higher methane content. In the two-phase batch study, the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced in the acidogenic reactor are not transferred to the methanogenic reactor. Consequently, the unavailability of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to the hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the methanogenic reactor is one of the significant reasons for lesser methane production in the system. Hydrogen, generated as a co-product during acidogenic reactions, influences hydrogen partial pressure (PH2), and H2/CO2 composition, which can influence the acidogenic reactions by inhibiting hydrolysis as well as further H2 generation (Wang et al., 2008; Kongjan et al.,2009; Clark et al., 2012). Increase in PH2 will also have an influence on the microbial community’s dynamics and diversity; wherein, acidogenic and hydrogen-producing microorganisms get inhibited (Sarkar and Venkata Mohan, 2017; Wainaina et al., 2019). Therefore, any change in the operation would affect the microbial community's dynamics and diversity, and exploiting them beneficially is the key to achieving an efficient process. If the PH2 was too high, it would decrease the number of reduced compounds in LBR, which negatively influences the anaerobic oxidation process in acetogenesis and methanogenesis. In low PH2, final electron acceptors (proton) will be used to produce H2. In the recent past, Xu et al. (2011) and Yan et al. (2016) observed that the headspace PH2 affected the soluble product speciation and pH in LBR. Therefore, inter-system hydrogen transfer technology, e.g., transferring H2 from LBR to UASB reactor, will help to regulate methane production in UASB and the acidogenesis process in LBR. Using this concept, in our previous batch study, the off-gas was transferred from LBR to UASB reactor to provide H2 and CO2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogens, the recovery of soluble products from LBR increased by 27% with the domination of butyrate and methane recovery in UASB reactor increased up to 38.6% (Yan et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the two-stage AD batch process could not provide a constant quality feed for the UASB reactor due to the metabolic shift inside the LBR. Also, batch mode operations of two-phase AD may not be very helpful in managing a huge volume of FW treatment daily. Therefore, optimizing the continuous mode of LBR operation is required. In continuous mode operation, acidogenic gas diversion, leachate recirculation and pH maintenance would be beneficial to produce consistent quality and quantity of leachate for continuous methane recovery in UASB reactor. Hence, the feasibility and advantages of a semi-continuous mode of operation were investigated in this study. There are a few studies on FW treatment in semi-continuous mode and the results showed comparatively higher COD removal efficiency and methane recovery two-stage AD process (Xu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). Using 3-L hybrid anaerobic solid–liquid (HASL) system, 85% of COD reduction was reported by Wang et al. (2003). In another study, with OLR of 8 gVSL−1d−1, methane yield of 385 mLgVS−1and 80.2% COD reduction efficiency were achieved in 1L digester (Zhang et al., 2015). Due to its high efficiency, semi-continuous anaerobic digestion has attracted much interest in treating FW. By combining these two techniques (gas transfer and semi-continuous mode of feeding), it is expected to provide better effects on metabolite speciation and energy recovery. Based on these considerations, the objectives of this study were to develop a two-stage semi-continuous system with hydrogen gas diversion from LBR to UASB reactor for enhanced methanogenesis; and to study the effects of gas diversion on FW digestion and leachate characteristics from LBR to facilitate comparing the efficiency of semi-continuous two-stage AD process with the batch process."
1,Material and methods,
2,Reactor setup: LBR and UASB reactor,"2.1 Reactor setup: LBR and UASB reactor As described in our previous study, four identical LBRs with 5.4L working volume and 2.9L leach bed volume were used as the acidogenic reactors (Yan et al., 2016). Two layers of nylon mesh (pore diameter < 1 mm) followed by 1 cm thick sand layer containing a top layer of glass beads were placed from bottom to top direction to prevent clogging and solids entering the leachate. One of the two gas outlets at the cap of the LBR was connected to the bottom inlet of UASB reactor through a peristaltic pump. In addition, the leachate from the LBRs was fed to the 10L UASB (methanogenic) reactor after pH adjustment (Fig. 1 )."
3,Food waste preparation,"2.2 Food waste preparation Artificial FW with a composition of 35% bread, 25% boiled rice, 25% cabbage and 15% boiled pork on a wet weight basis was used as the substrate (Xu et al., 2011). The particle size of boiled rice, meat, bread, and cabbage was reduced to 4–6 mm using a blender. After particle size reduction, the individual components of the artificial FW were mixed thoroughly in the ratio mentioned above and stored in plastic bags at −20 °C before starting the experiment. The frozen FW was thawed to room temperature, before feeding into LBR. The use of simulated FW facilitated the replication of experiments and helped to compare the results with previous studies using the same experimental setup. Anaerobically digested sludge from UASB reactor was used as inoculum and plastic beads were used as bulking agents."
4,Operation of LBR and transferring acidogenic off-gas to UASB reactor,"2.3 Operation of LBR and transferring acidogenic off-gas to UASB reactor The LBRs were filled with 2.0 kg of artificial FW mixed with 20% (wet weight) seed sludge as inoculum and 10% of plastic beads as a bulking agent. After closing the top cover, 2L of tap water was added to the LBR to maintain a substrate to water ratio of 1:1 to enable natural leaching. On the 2nd and 3rd day, 200 g of FW was added to reach a desired height inside the LBR. From day 5 onwards, 100 g of FW was added to LBR on alternate days continuously up to 30 days. The FW feeding and leachate recirculation in LBR, and the leachate feeding in UASB reactor were carried out on alternate days. Samples from LBR and UASB reactor were also collected during that time. During FW feeding to LBR, the leachate was taken out, and its volume was recorded, then exactly 50% of the leachate with pH adjusted to 6.0 using 5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was recycled into the LBR from the top, and 50 mL was reserved for analysis. Along with leachate recirculation in LBR, feeding of UASB reactor was also carried out on each alternate day. The remaining 50% of the leachate was fed to the corresponding UASB reactor after adjusting the pH to 7 using 5 M NaOH, and 50 mL was reserved for analysis. For the gas transfer, the LBR-UASB reactor set-up was operated in a semi-continuous mode to reveal the quantity and composition of acidogenic gas, biogas composition and methane production as focal points. The volume of biogas produced in LBR can be determined in terms of pressure. After the headspace pressure increased to 3.3 psi, the gas was allowed to flow to the UASB reactor, thus maintaining a constant pressure in the LBR. The flow rate of acidogenic biogas from LBR to UASB reactor was controlled by Mass Flow Controller (MFC, Seven Star). A computer-based proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller was applied to control the system and collect data. The pressure sensor was transmitting a message to the computer when the headspace pressure of LBR is more than or equal to the set value. Immediately, the computer was sending out the signal to switch on the pump till the gas pressure resumes to 3.3 psi (Fig. 1). In one set of experiments, the gas was diverted from the LBR-B and LBR-D to UASB reactor and these were considered as test LBRs, while in the other set (LBR-A and LBR-C), gas transfer was not done and these were considered as control LBRs."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) of the solid FW were determined on day one by oven drying at 105 °C for 24 h and igniting at 550 °C for 16 h in a muffle furnace, respectively. Removal efficiencies of TS, VS and total organic carbon (TOC) were calculated according to APHA (2005). The pH, total COD (tCOD), soluble COD (sCOD), VFA of the acidogenic leachate from LBR were analyzed using the methods reported in previous studies (APHA, 2005; Xu et al., 2014a). Before filtration, parameters such as leachate/effluent volume, pH value, COD were analyzed from the leachate collected from LBRs and UASB reactor. A volumetric cylinder was used to measure leachate volume, and the pH of the leachate and effluent was determined directly by pH-electrode (Orion 920, Thermo). Ammonium–nitrogen (NH4 +-N) of acidogenic leachate from LBR was measured according to APHA (2005). After filtration of leachate with 0.45 µm cellulose acetate membrane, soluble products (except lactic acid) were analyzed using HP 6890 Series gas chromatography (GC, Hewlett Packard) with flame ionization detector (FID), using Econo-Cap EC1000 (15 m × 0.53 mm × 1.20 µm) coated with 0.2 µm CP-Wax 57 CB column according to the protocol previously described by Yan et al. (2016). Lactic acid was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters Alliance 2695) coupled with Waters 2996 photodiode array (PDA) detector, using Ultrasphere® ODS Column C-18 column (10 µm, 25 cm × 4.6 mm ID), (Beckman Coulter, USA) column, at 210 nm wavelength, with 85% 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 2.8) and 15% methanol as mobile phase at0.7 mL/min flow rate. Total soluble products (TSP) are the sum of products (ethanol, propanol and butanol), solvents (acetone), lactate and fatty acids (acetate, propionate, iso- and n-butyrate, iso- and n-valerate and caproate). The volume of acidogenic biogas was measured using a mass flow controller (Seven Star) with real-time data logging (AIDCS system monitor), while the methanogenic biogas production from UASB reactor was measured by a wet drum-type wet gas flow meter (BSD-0.5, Shanghai). The gas compositions in the headspace of the LBRs and outlet of UASB reactor were periodically measured using a gas chromatograph (HP7890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and PLOT-Q column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 15 µm)."
6,"Rate kinetics of hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis in LBR","2.5 Rate kinetics of hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis in LBR In order to compare the effects of continuous FW addition and acidogenic off-gas transfer on the solubilization of particulate solids and hydrolysis rate, the kinetics of COD and soluble products production was determined. Parameters reflecting the performance, i.e., soluble and total COD, VFAs, pH of LBR leachate, organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), the hydrolysis rate of FW and the biogas compositions were analyzed to evaluate the performance of both LBR and UASB reactors. The methane conversion efficiency (MCE%) of FW leachate in UASB reactor was calculated using Eq. (1). (1) M C E ( % ) = CMP ∗ 10000 O L ∗ C O D r ∗ T M Y ∗ V where, CMP is cumulative methane production (L), OL is the organic loading (gCOD.L−1), CODr is the substrate removal efficiency (%), V is the substrate feeding volume to the reactor (L) and TMY is the theoretical methane yield (0.350 g·L−1CODr). VFA kinetics was calculated depending upon VFA production and consumption profile to understand the treatment efficiency and VFA conversion pathways according to Sarkar and Venkata Mohan (2017). Substrate degradation rate is regulated by the relationship between substrate and inoculum and determined by Ks (affinity of microorganism for substrate) and Contois equation, which will be appropriate to describe the kinetics of hydrolysis of FW in LBR. Thus, hydrolysis (gsCOD.gtCOD−1d−1), acidogenesis (gtVFA.gsCOD−1d−1) and acetogenesis in terms of acetic acid (AA) (gAA.gtVFA−1d−1) rates and their respective rate constants, i.e., qH (hydrolysis), qA (acidogenesis) and qAC (acetogenesis) were evaluated from tCOD, sCOD, tVFA, and total acetic acid (tAA) in the reaction mixture according to Chakraborty and Venkata Mohan (2018)."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 20.0 statistical software to evaluate the effect of continuous feeding with gas transfer on leachate characteristics, e.g., VFA dynamics during the performance of the two-phase AD digesters. The significant correlation coefficient (two-tailed) and regression analysis were performed among ethanol, propanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovalerate, valerate, and lactate upon their relative abundance in leachate. It was considered significantly different at P < 0.05 level."
8,Results and discussion,The LBR was operated with a total loading of 3.7 kg of FW and an OLR of 8.03 kgVS m−3.d−1 for 3 days of start-up and 27 days of semi-continuous operation and coupled with acidogenic gas transfer from LBR to UASB reactor.
9,pH analysis,"3.1 pH analysis In the batch study, the leachate pH varied between 3 and 5.5 (Yan et al., 2016), while in the semi-continuous mode, the pH was stable, i.e., between 3.8 and 4.25 (Fig. 2 a). After two days, in all LBRs, the pH started decline from 4.5 to 3.45 in control and from 4.5 to 4.0 in test LBR. The addition of NaOH and leachate recirculation helped to increase the pH from the second day onwards up to the sixth day for control (pH of 3.97) and test LBR (pH of 4.59). During the second week, the pH became steady (control: 3.65 and test: 3.9) and increased further to 4.2 and 4.3 until the 24thday for control and test, respectively. Finally, during the end of the fourth week, the pH decreased to 3.74 (control) and 3.96 (test) due to the accumulation of VFA in the system, similar to the studies reported previously by Lu et al. (2008); Dogan et al. (2009); Selvam et al. (2010). Results depicted that pH was higher in test LBR than control and may be linked to lower PH2, and higher CO2 concentrations in the gas mixture. Simultaneously, the semi-continuous addition of FW could also have stimulated the facultative anaerobic microorganisms dominated by homoacetogens, leading to accelerated acetic acid production. The addition of NaOH reacted with acetic acid to form acetate buffer (acetic acid and sodium acetate) to regulate the pH. However, as discussed later in Section 3.2, due to higher production of acetic acid in test LBR, and consequent acetate buffer formation, a better pH regulation was observed than the control. Lower pH value affects the substrate conversion rate in the hydrolysis phase of the acidogenic reactor, as reported by Vavilin et al. (2001). The average leachate generations from control and test LBRs were 918 and 1067 mL, respectively. From the results, it is evident that throughout the experiment, there were variations in the leachate production in both LBRs. However, the variation in leachate production was significant from the 12th to 24th days, during which the leachate production was higher in test LBR due to the high-rate FW decomposition that was influenced by the operational differences (Fig. 2b). After the 24th day, the leachate production got drastically reduced in both LBRs due to clogging of the perforated floor. Previously Demirer and Chen (2008) found similar problems in LBR treating undiluted dairy manure and found reduced leachability rate and nutrient mass transfer within the reactor."
10,COD analysis,"3.2 COD analysis The sCOD production represents the liquefaction of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. In the present investigation, the sCOD production was higher after the hydrolysis phase (8th day). There was a sharp increase in sCOD production from the 9th day till 14th day and became steady from the 16th day till the end of the experiment. As depicted in Fig. 2c, the rate of sCOD production was higher (3–5 gL−1) in the test LBR than in the control. The COD removal efficiency was in the range of 30–45% during the third and fourth weeks of the experiment (Fig. 2d), and the maximum was on day 24, i.e., in test LBR, it was 45.18% (0.52 g.gVS−1), and in the control, it was 39.37% (0.46 g.gVS−1). After the 30thday, the cumulative sCOD production in the control was 475.2 gL−1 (1141.5 g·kgVS−1), and in the test LBR, it was 531.6 gL−1 (1440.03 g·kgVS−1). In the batch study done by Yan et al. (2016), the maximum sCOD production was 0.59 g.gVS−1 with gas transfer on day 14, which was 36% higher than the control. The COD concentration decreased after the peak production due to the conversion of simple soluble intermediates to gaseous products and leachate. Higher headspace gas pressure was favourable for the leaching of COD during the first 10 days. The results of the present investigation show that sCOD yield was marginally higher in the batch study than the test LBR because of the better redox environment in the former. At pH of ∼ 4.2, the COD removal efficiency of the test LBR was highest, although a pH range of 4.6–5.2 was reported to be favourable for anaerobic hydrolysis (Kim et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Bochmann and Montgomery, 2013). The pH range observed in this experiment should be attributable to the rapid accumulation of VFA, which will, in turn, affects the hydrolysis, metabolic pathways and microbial activities (Obulisamy et al., 2016; Wainaina et al., 2019). Comparison of NH4 +-N (shown in the supplementary information) indicated that the protein degradation increased in test LBR (35 mgL−1) than control (30 mgL−1). However, in batch study after the 10thday, NH4 +-N decreased as reported by Yan et al. (2016) due to retarded hydrolysis after the first week. The advantage of semi-continuous operation over batch operation is that FW's addition helps the system generate NADH by which hydrolysis and VFA production would happen simultaneously. However, in the batch experiment, the NADH supply chain will be hindered in the absence of substrate addition; hence, the acidogenesis process gets affected (Yan et al., 2016; Wainaina et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2021). In the semi-continuous experiment, protein degradation was low during the first ten days, after which the rate of degradation increased in the test LBR compared to control."
11,VFA production and its effects on acidogenesis in LBR,"3.3 VFA production and its effects on acidogenesis in LBR In the test LBR, the concentrations of VFA were, acetate of 8–24 gL−1 (∼50–65%), lactate of 4–10 gL−1 (∼21–32%), propionate of 0.98–2.86 gL−1 (∼4–11%) and butyrate of 0.1–2.17 gL−1 (∼2–6%); which were higher than the control (Fig. 3 a and 3c). The VFA concentrations in control were acetate of 6–20 gL−1(∼40–50%), lactate of 2–10 gL−1(∼13–26%), propionate of 1.10–2.18 gL−1(∼3–8%) and butyrate 0.12–1.88gL−1 (∼1–4%) (Fig. 3 b and 3c). Rapid hydrolysis and acidogenesis of FW during the first 5 to 7 days (lag phase) in control and test LBRs resulted in higher production of VFA. After the first week, the VFA production increased rapidly in both studies due to the stabilization of soluble carbohydrates concentration (Tang et al., 2016). However, the acetic acid production rate was higher in test LBR, probably due to the abundance of homoacetogens and hydrogen producers. The concentration of acetic acid was dominant, followed by lactic, propionic and butyric acids, and ethanol concentrations. With increasing time, acetate production got increased and became maximum on day 24 (Fig. 3c). An increase in ethanol production was observed after the 10thday, and it became steady from the 12th day onwards in the range of 2–2.8 gL−1and 1.56–1.72 gL−1 in test and control, respectively. Out of the total VFA generated, butyrate was found in the range of 1–4.5% in control and 2–6% in test LBR. During the steady-state operation, the butyrate production increased from the tenth day onwards till the end of the experiment. Other alcohols and VFA (e.g., propanol, isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate) were found in a negligible range (<1%). The cumulative TSP production after 30 days were 373.23 gL−1 (897.25 g·kgVS−1) and 451.04 g·L−1 (1230 g·kgVS−1) in control and test LBRs, respectively (Table 1 ). In this experiment, low PH2 and gas transfer increased VFA production in test LBR, as detailed in section 3.5 below. During the first week, the concentration of butyric acids was low, but ethanol, lactic, and acetic acid concentrations were high. However, after 8–10 days, propionate and butyrate concentrations increased because at lower pH 3.8–4, the acidogens took time to increase their biomass. The pH range of 3–5 and VFA concentration of>6 gL−1 are desirable in the acidogenic reactor (Wang et al., 2002). However, in the batch study done by Yan et al. (2016), with the gas transfer, butyric acid was abundant after the fourth day, and with time, the total concentration of butyric acid increased and reached a maximum of 80% of total VFA during the second week. However, in the control batch study, the butyric acid production was lesser than test LBR, with more caproic acid production after the first week. Ethanol and lactate production decreased after the eighth day, and caproic acid was only about 5% after the first week of fermentation. The concentrations of acetate (5–8%), ethanol (>5%) and propionate (3–10%) varied throughout the experiment. Comparative results between batch study and present investigation depicted that acetate fraction (∼50–65%) was 8–10 times more than batch study (5–8%). However, the butyrate fraction (2–6%) in the present semi-continuous experiment was 60–70 times lesser than the batch experiment (80%). In the semi-continuous experiment, pH around 3.8–4.2 was favourable for acetic acid production, but in the batch study, higher pH 4.5–5.5 supported butyrate production (Chen et al., 2015). From days 28 to 30, the caproic and valeric acid concentrations increased in test LBR and control due to protein degradation during late acidogenesis, which leads to valerate production (Lata et al., 2002; Wainaina et al., 2019). Long-chain fatty acids production in late acidogenesis was due to the enrichment of specific microbial groups that convert short-chain to long-chain fatty acids (Chakraborty et al., 2018a). With semi-continuous feeding, ethanol was dominant during the initial stages and became steady after the tenth day in control and test LBR, but in the batch study, ethanol concentration reduced with time (Yan et al., 2016). Ethanol is a reduced product with high energy value, and its production is related to low pH and high OLR (Wainaina et al., 2019)."
12,Biogas analysis,"3.4 Biogas analysis With the increase in acetate and butyrate concentrations in LBR leachate, methane generation increased in the UASB reactor. The pH of UASB reactor effluent was in the range of 7.5 to 8, which is the optimum pH for methanogenesis. The initial pH of UASB reactor effluent was around 7.8, and within a week, it decreased and stabilized at around 7.5. Addition of LBR leachate to UASB reactor helped the methanogenic microbial populations stabilize within the first week of operation. Ethanol, propanol, butanol and lactic acid were absent in UASB reactor effluent, but acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate, caproate were found in the range of 0.5–1.5%. During the second week (log phase), sCOD and methane production increased rapidly and became maximum on the third week. The cumulative biogas yield was 26.1 L (0.19 mL·gCOD−1 feeding) and 55 L (0.32 mL·gCOD−1feeding) in the UASB reactors connected to control and test LBR, respectively. The cumulative methane yield of the UASB reactor connected to test LBR was 29.23 L (167.55 mL·gCOD−1feeding), which was three times higher than that of the UASB reactor connected to the control LBR 8.65 L (63.19 mL·gCOD−1feeding) (Table 1). The maximum methane content in the biogas was 69% on the 20th day and 81.83% on the 16th day in control and test LBR. The methane conversion efficiency of control was 17.3%, but for the test LBR, it was 47.8%. Due to acidogenic gas transfer and dominance of acetic acid in LBR leachate, the methane content increased in the biogas from the 14th day onwards. The decrease in methane production from the 22nd day onwards was due to VFA accumulation with the dominance of lactic and propionic acids in the LBR. Additionally, the energetic feasibilities of butyrate are favourable for methane generations than propionate, acetate and valerate (Wang et al., 1999; Chakraborty et al., 2018b). Analysis of volume and composition of headspace LBR acidogenic gas revealed that hydrogen production rate was higher in test LBR experiment (0.0027 L Lreactor−1day−1) than control (0.0023 LLreactor−1day−1). Nevertheless, hydrogen production in the LBRs was not high because of the production of lactic acid (reduced compound), which is usually accompanied by depletion of hydrogen, under low pH (Li et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2016). However, diversion of acidogenic off-gas decreases PH2 in the test LBR and increased the H2 production rate. The CO2 production rate was also higher in test LBR (0.054 LLreactor−1day−1) than in control (0.035 LLreactor−1day−1). Production of NADH increased after removing CO2 from the headspace of test LBR, consequently under low PH2, hydrogen production increased (Mizuno et al., 2000). Furthermore, with higher CO2 concentration in the headspace, the microbial activity increases (Yan et al., 2016). In the test LBR, the hydrogen production was steady, so the H2 to CO2 ratio decreased with time in the LBR headspace (Fig. 4 c). Depleting head space PH2 increases the microbial growth rate, which increased the CO2 production significantly in the test LBR experiment. In control, H2 was retained in the headspace, and this high PH2 might have adversely affected the microbial growth rate due to the reduced environment. Further, the hydrolysis gets affected, so lesser COD yield was obtained in the leachate, as described by Nie et al. (2008) and Yan et al. (2016)."
13,Kinetics and statistical analysis,"3.5 Kinetics and statistical analysis Acidogenesis, the key regulator of methanogenesis, starts with hydrolysis, which is the fastest step and provides energy for the microorganisms during AD. The hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis rates can be discussed with the first-order kinetics and were observed to be lower in control (51.2%, 78.5%, and 54.2%) when compared to test LBR (61.4%, 84.8%, and 56.9%). The rate constants qH (hydrolysis), qA (acidogenesis) and qAC (acetogenesis) during hydrolysis and acidogenesis of FW were 0.011671, 0.009163, 0.005022 d−1 and 0.013025, 0.011161, 0.006373 d−1 for control and test LBR, respectively (Table 1). The rate constants of all three phases were higher in test LBR than control. In general hydrolysis rate constant of FW ranges between 0.24 and 0.47 d−1 (Vavilin et al., 2001), but in this investigation, it is lower because of lactic acid accumulation and acidic pH environment. The acidogenesis rate was highest among the three phases because of low PH2 and concomitant gas transfer, which led to the rapid conversion of sugars to VFA during the second week. The acetogenesis rate was>50% in both control and test LBR, enabling the thermodynamically favoured acetate formation pathway from Acetyl-CoA (Zhou et al., 2017). Acetate is not only sourced from the degradation of pyruvate through the Acetyl-CoA pathway but can also be produced from the syntrophic oxidation of propionate and butyrate (Müller et al., 2010). Acetate serves as the substrate for about 70% of the total methane produced during AD because of the favourable environment for acetogensis in LBR, which require a low PH2, and the reactions are endergonic. Hence, it must be syntrophically coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, as reported by Yan et al. (2016). The semi-continuous addition of FW influenced the acidogenic process by changing the dynamics of the metabolites, particularly the concentration and composition of VFA. For the control, the maximum production of acetate 0.104 g·L−1h−1, lactate 0.054 g·L−1h−1, propionate 0.028 g·L−1h−1, and 0.005 g·L−1h−1 butyrate was observed on the second day. In the test LBR, the maximum production of acetate 0.14 g·L−1h−1, lactate 0.094 g·L−1h−1, propionate g·L−1h−1, and butyrate of 0.007 g·L−1h−1 was also observed on the second day. The maximum consumption of the metabolites happened at different times, i.e., for butyrate −0.015 g·L−1h−1, lactate −0.04 g·L−1h−1 on day 8 and for acetate −0.13 g·L−1h−1 on day 26, and for propionate −0.01542 g·L−1h−1 on day 28 in control (Fig. 5 a). In the test LBR, the maximum consumption of butyrate −0.013 g·L−1h−1and lactate −0.054 g·L−1h−1 was on day 6 and for acetate −0.187 g·L−1h−1on day 8 and for propionate −0.014 g·L−1h−1on day 24 (Fig. 5b). As seen in Fig. 5, the production and consumption rates of VFA and lactic acid were higher in the test LBR than in the control. The production was maximum in the first week and became steady and continuous throughout the experiment, but the consumption occurred intermittently during the first, third, and fourth weeks only. During the first week, both hydrolysis and acidogenesis happened, which led to maximum VFA production, but from days 10 to 22, acidogenesis dominated. This production pattern was followed by enhanced consumption and methane production during the third and fourth weeks, as discussed in Section 3.4 above. It has to be noted from Fig. 5 that higher production and consumption of acetate is correlated with methane production in test LBR (Sarkar and Venkata Mohan, 2017). To reconfirm the relationship between TSP with methane yield in terms of their production and consumption, a statistical correlation analysis was carried out for the test LBR and control. Statistical significance among test LBR and control in semi-continuous mode was evaluated by SPSS 20 correlation and regression analysis. A significant correlation was found among alcohols, lactic acid and VFA, which had an impact on the methane yield. Acetate was correlated with other VFAs, considering it as an essential metabolite for methane production. There was a positive correlation observed between acetate with ethanol, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate, valerate and lactate in both control and test LBR (shown in the supplementary information). The regression analysis among these metabolites was conducted, and regression analysis between acetate and propionate; acetate and butyrate; propionate and lactate; ethanol and lactate were found to be significant (shown in the supplementary information). In the control, propionate and lactate regression was less significant than others because of the non-spontaneous conversion of lactate to propionate. This analysis reinforced the advantage of regulating headspace pressure and gas diversion during semi-continuous feeding in LBR, wherein all VFA metabolites were directed towards acetic acid production. In our present investigation, sugar to acetic acid conversion through the Acetyl CoA pathway seems favourable (Eq. (2)). The pH was not favourable for butyric acid production, and simultaneous addition of organic FW increased acetic acid production due to homoacetate fermentation (Eq. (3)). In the test LBR, probably because of low PH2, the homoacetogens proliferated better than the hydrogenotrophs for converting excessive CO2 and H2 to acetate. (2) C6H12O6 + 2 H2O → 4H2 + 2CH3COOH + 2 CO2, ΔG: −206.3 kJmol−1 (3) 4H2 + CO2 → CH3COO−+H++2H2O, △G: −95 kJmol−1 Three types of fermentations mainly occur in the anaerobic acidogenic phase, i.e., ethanol-type (with > 80%ethanol and acetic acid), butyric acid type (with > 70–90%butyric acid and acetic acid), and propionic acid type (with > 70–90% propionic acid and acetic acid) (Lu et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2016; Sarkar and Venkata Mohan, 2017). Based on the VFA dynamics and their statistical analysis, it can be predicted that in the current investigation, mixed-type fermentation occurred both in the control and test LBR."
14,Conclusions,"Semi-continuous FW addition generated stable leachate after the second week, with acetate as the single dominant VFA (65%), which was 8–10 times higher than the batch study. The lower H2 to CO2 ratio in the headspace of test LBR also enhanced acetate production in the leachate. Consequently, the methane generation from test LBR leachate was triple than that of the control. Further research on precise pH regulation by controlling lactate concentration has to be done to produce energetically feasible leachate that could enhance methane production through a high performance continuous two-stage LBR-UASB reactor-gas transfer model."
