0,Introduction,"Solar water-splitting has emerged as a promising pathway for storing solar energy in the form of renewable hydrogen energy to accomplish energy demands [1-5]. Graphitic carbon nitride (CN), an outstanding polymeric semiconductor with two-dimension skeleton, has gained widespread attention as an efficient photocatalyst for solar water-splitting owing to its low cost, suitable energy band gap (ca. 2.70 eV), and high thermodynamic and chemical stability [6–9]. However, CN still exhibits low photocatalytic activity due to its poor charge-separation efficiency which is ascribed to the fact that the photogenerated electrons could be captured by the high-electronegativity nitrogen in the heptazine rings [10–12]. Up to now, various strategies, such as modifying microstructures [13], doping with low-electronegativity atoms (C, S, Br etc.) [14–16], or coupling with other semiconductors [17], have been attempted to facilitate charge-separation efficiency in CN. In addition, copolymerization with π-electron rich aromatic monomers, which introduces aromatic rings to CN framework, is a potential approach to provide more channels that accelerate migration of photogenerated electrons [10,18,19]. Liu and his colleagues developed a novel benzene-ring modified CN nanosheets photocatalyst by copolymerization of urea with 4, 4′-sulfonyldiphenol [18]. The benzene-ring, incorporated into the heptazine rings of CN framework through sp2-hybridized C–N bonds, promotes absorption of visible light and migration of the photogenerated electrons, thus the benzene-ring modified CN nanosheets exhibit superb photocatalytic activity. We have successfully synthesized different numbers of aromatic rings-modified CN via thermal polymerization of urea with benzoic acid, naphthoic acid or anthroic acid [19]. The work indicates that incorporating with appropriate aromatic rings extends the π-conjugated system of CN framework and accelerates its separation of photogenerated electrons. However, for all the catalysts obtained by the above-mentioned methods, Pt is necessary to reduce the overpotential for photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen. Therefore, it remains challenging to explore a low-cost, earth-abundant, and highly efficient co-catalyst to replace Pt for efficient H2 evolution. Nickel complexes are regarded as ideal substituent for noble metals because of their easily accessible oxidation states of Ni [Ni(0), Ni(I), Ni(II), Ni(III), and Ni(IV)] [20–25]. During photocatalytic reactions, the reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(I) is concomitant with the formation of dihydrogen [26,27]. The rich redox properties coupled with various coordination geometries enable rational design of ligand scaffolds to coordinate with Ni(II) centers, endowing the nickel complexes with specific properties [28-30]. A homogeneous nickel thiolate catalyst was reported with much longer lifetime for efficient hydrogen production with triethylamine as a sacrificial reagent and fluorescein as a photosensitizer [28]. A novel photocatalytic system consisting of a nickel complex (photocatalyst) and CdS nanorods (photosensitizer) for hydrogen production from water has also been demonstrated [29]. In the photocatalytic reaction, Ni(II) in the nickel complex accepts the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of CdS nanorods and yields reduced Ni(I). After addition of protons and photogenerated electrons, the nickel ion goes back to the initial nickel complex and gives out H2. Our previous work also reported a noble-metal-free photocatalyst, in which graphitic carbon nitride serves as a semiconductor to absorb visible light, while nickel oxide as a hole accepter and nickel complex as a hydrogen releasing site [30]. As afore-mentioned, incorporating aromatic rings and bonding with nickel complex onto CN framework are effective strategies to prepare efficient, earth-abundant, and noble-metal-free photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen generation. Herein, an efficient visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution method was achieved through the synthesis of a novel and highly efficient photocatalyst based on nickel complex (NiL) and in-plane benzene ring-modified graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (CN-DAPS) by copolymerization of urea and π-electron-rich 4, 4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DAPS) via a controlled thermal-etching step. Incorporation of in-plane benzene-ring promotes the migration of photogenerated electrons and improves the absorption of visible light. In addition, NiL is covalently bound onto CN-DAPS framework, enabling the intramolecular electron transfer from CN-DAPS to the coordinately-bonded nickel complex. Actually, the novel photocatalysts NiL/CN-DAPS exhibit superior H2 evolution activity, with an optimum H2 generation rate of 30.67 μmol·h−1."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Urea was purchased from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) was obtained from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Formaldehyde was bought from Guangzhou Donghong Chemical Factory (Guangzhou, China). Nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O) was acquired from Guangzhou Xingang Chemical Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). 4, 4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DAPS), 2-picolylamine, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HDBA), diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD), and triethanolamine (98%, TEOA) were gained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and diethyl ether (Et2O) were attained from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory (Guangzhou, China). All of the reagents were used without further purification. Ultrapure (18 MΩ·cm) deionized (DI) water was obtained by a pure water system (GWA-UN, Beijing, China)."
3,Synthesis of photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of photocatalysts The synthetic procedure of NiL/CN-DAPS is shown in Fig. 1 . A possible reaction scheme of CN-DAPS and NiL/CN-DAPS is depicted in Fig. S1. 2.2.1 Synthesis of CN-DAPS and CN Following the steps of a previous paper [18], 10 g urea and 10 mg DAPS were mixed and ground uniformly. The mixture was put into a crucible with a cover and heated to 550 °C in a muffle furnace with a ramping rate of 2.3 °C·min−1. The temperature was sustained for 4 h and then cooled down to room temperature. Then, the as-prepared sample was transferred into a porcelain boat without a cover and heated to 500 °C in a muffle furnace with a ramping rate of 10 °C·min−1 and was kept at the temperature for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained sample was labeled as CN-DAPS. Similarly, pristine CN powder was synthesized by thermal pyrolysis of urea without DAPS. 2.2.2 Synthesis of NiL/CN-DAPS 0.1 g CN-DAPS were dispersed in 20 mL dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and sonicated for 30 min. Certain quantity of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HDBA, 0, 0.03, 0.16, 0.31, 0.47, and 0.62 g) was added into the above suspension under ice-water bath. Meanwhile, equal mole ratio of triphenylphosphine was added as a catalyst. After stirring for 30 min, diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) with the same mole quantity in dry THF (15 mL) was added dropwise to the above suspension. The suspension was stirred overnight at room temperature. After evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure, the obtained residue was suspended in Et2O. Subsequently, the precipitate (Sample 1) was obtained by filtration and drying [31,32]. The residue was transferred into 20 mL N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and sonicated for 30 min, and then corresponding amounts of 2-picolylamine (0, 0.01, 0.07, 0.14, 0.21 and 0.28 g) and formaldehyde (0, 0.02, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 g) dissolved in 10 mL DMF were added into the suspension and stirred for 8 h. After being filtered and dried, the obtained samples were marked as xL/CN-DAPS (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The as-prepared xL/CN-DAPS were dispersed into 20 mL DMF. After being sonicated for 30 min, certain content of NiCl2·6H2O (0, 0.03, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45 and 0.6 g) was added into the above suspension and stirred overnight, respectively. Finally, the samples named as xNiL/CN-DAPS (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) were gained by filtration and drying [33,34]. The detailed synthesized conditions and contents of Ni for xNiL/CN-DAPS are illustrated in Table S1. First, phenol reacted with 2-picolylamine to form amine-bis(phenolate) ligand, which was grafted onto the framework of CN. Then, Ni2+ was introduced to generate the complex. For comparison, simple deposition of Ni complex without covalent bonding (3NiL@CN-DAPS) was prepared followed a similar process as 3NiL/CN-DAPS without adding PPh3 and DEAD."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a Bruker GADDS using Cu Kα source to analyze the phase structure of the as-prepared samples. A Merlin-Zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) operated at 5 kV and a JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) operated at 300 kV were used to evaluate the microscopic morphologies of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB 250-X1 instrument was used to investigate the chemical states of the as-prepared samples. All binding energies were calibrated by the internal standard C 1s peak (284.8 eV) that arises from surface adventitious carbon. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on an IR Affiniy-1 spectrometer, mixing the samples with KBr powder as the matrix. The optical properties of the samples were measured by UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra equipped with a Hitachi U-3010 spectrometer over the region of 200–800 nm using BaSO4 as a reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were carried out in a F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm."
5,DFT calculations,"2.4 DFT calculations The computational calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) was performed on Guassian09 program. The B3LYP functions and 6–31 G (d, p) basis set for all atoms were employed in the DFT calculation. The HOMO and LUMO levels of CN, CN-DAPS, or NiL/CN-DAPS models were constructed by serving a minimum unit cell (CN, CN-DAPS, or NiL/CN-DAPS trimer) as the calculation model to explain the experimental observations qualitatively."
6,Photoelectrochemical test,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical test Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in an electrolyte of 0.5 mol·L−1 Na2SO4 (pH = 6.5) aqueous solution. A three-electrode system was used to record the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), photocurrent response, and liner sweep voltammetry (LSV), equipped with a counter electrode (a Pt plate), a reference electrode (a KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl electrode), and a working electrode (sample deposited fluoride-tin oxide, FTO). The working electrode was prepared as follows: 1 mg ethyl cellulose and 10 mg photocatalyst were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol and sonicated for 30 min. Then, the suspension was uniformly deposited onto a 1 × 1 cm2 FTO glass. The working electrode was obtained after being dried at 100 °C for 1 h. For photocurrent response, a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300/300UV), as a visible light source (λ > 420 nm), was adjusted to 100 mW·cm−2 to irradiate the as-prepared working electrode. 0.01 M K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 (1:1) solution was used as an electrolyte to record the EIS plots in the range of 106 to 10-2 Hz in the dark. LSV was scanned from −0.58 to −1.38 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 6.5)."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution test,"2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution test 50 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in a solution containing 10 mL TEOA and 90 mL DI water. After being sonicated for 30 min, the suspension was transferred into a Pyrex flask, which is connected to a vacuum circulatory system (Labsolar III AG, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd., China). Before light irradiation, the system was vacuumed for 30 min to remove the air. The reactor was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300/300UV) with a UV-cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) and the light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW·cm−2. The amount of H2 was detected by a gas chromatography (GC 7806, a thermal conductive detector), with N2 as a carrier gas and a 5A molecule as a separation column. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was defined by Eq. (1) and measured under the same conditions as photocatalytic reaction excepting for utilizing the monochromatic light with a band-pass filter (400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 nm). (1) AQE ( % ) = number of reacted electrons number of incident photos = 2 × number of H 2 molecules number of incident photos"
8,Results and discussion,"The microstructures of CN, CN-DAPS, and 3NiL/CN-DAPS were characterized by SEM and TEM (Fig. 2 ). SEM images of CN, CN-DAPS, and 3NiL/CN-DAPS are shown in Fig. 2A-C. All of the samples exhibit a typical two-dimensional nanosheet-stacked outlook. As there is no nanoparticle found in Fig. 2C, NiL is supposed to be uniformly dispersed on CN-DAPS framework. TEM images of CN, CN-DAPS, and 3NiL/CN-DAPS are shown in Fig. 2D–F. All of the samples display similar edge-bending layered outlook, which is consistent with SEM observation. According to high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM and elemental mappings of 3NiL/CN-DAPS, C, N, O, Ni, and small amounts of S and Cl are uniformly dispersed (Fig. 2G-M). S and Cl are derived from CN-DAPS and NiL, respectively. In addition, the high dispersion of Ni and Cl in Fig. 2K and 2L indicates that NiL is homogeneously dispersed on CN-DAPS skeleton. It is expected that high dispersion of NiL will facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from CN-DAPS to NiL, and provide more hydrogen releasing sites as well. The phase structures of CN-DAPS and xNiL/CN-DAPS were assayed by XRD. As shown in Fig. S2, both CN-DAPS and xNiL/CN-DAPS exhibit two characteristic diffraction peaks at 27.5° (002) and 12.9° (100), corresponding to graphitic stacking between layers and repeating units of tris-triazine ring of CN-DAPS [35], respectively. Notably, the intensity of the characteristic diffraction peak at 27.5° decreases upon the increasing contents of NiL. Obviously, the attachment of NiL onto CN-DAPS inhibits the graphitic stacking of CN-DAPS between layers. Due to the low contents of NiL, it is hard to discover its characteristic diffraction peak from XRD patterns of the samples. The catalysts were further investigated by XPS (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Fig. 3A, XPS survey spectra prove the existence of C, N and O elements in CN, trivial amount of S in CN-DAPS except C, N, O, while small amounts of S, Ni, and Cl in 3NiL/CN-DAPS except C, N, O. The elemental composition of CN, CN-DAPS and 3NiL/CN-DAPS according to XPS analysis is summarized in Table S2. For CN-DAPS, modification with DAPS leads to the increased C/N atomic ratio than that of CN (from 0.76 to 0.91) and the existence of S (0.16 at.%), which is ascribed to in-plane benzene-ring modified CN, that is, CN-DAPS [18]. Compared with CN-DAPS, the C/N atomic ratio of 3NiL/CN-DAPS increases from 0.91 to 1.01, which is attributed to covalent combination of NiL. The high-resolution C 1s spectra of CN, CN-DAPS and 3NiL/CN-DAPS are shown in Fig. 3B. All of the photocatalysts exhibit two characteristic peaks at 288.2 and 284.8 eV, corresponding to sp2 hybridized carbon (N–CN) and aromatic carbon (CC), respectively [36]. In addition, CN-DAPS and 3NiL/CN-DAPS show a weak peak at 286.4 eV, corresponding to C–S [37]. Table S3 lists the relative ratios of carbon species in CN, CN-DAPS, and 3NiL/CN-DAPS. Compared with CN, the content of aromatic carbon in CN-DAPS and 3NiL/CN-DAPS increases with the introduction of DAPS and NiL. In Fig. 3C, both CN and CN-DAPS exhibit four signal peaks at binding energy of 398.4, 399.1, 400.7 and 404.4 eV, corresponding to sp2-hybrid N (CNC, N2C), tertiary N (N−(C)3, N3C), quaternary N (C–NHx, N1C) and delocalized π excitations, respectively [38]. The high-resolution N 1s characteristic peaks of 3NiL/CN-DAPS are similar to that of CN and CN-DAPS. However, compared with CN and CN-DAPS, the characteristic peaks of N2C (398.5 eV) and N3C (399.2 eV) of 3NiL/CN-DAPS shift to high binding energy. The high-shift of binding energy demonstrates the decreased electrons around CN-DAPS framework on 3NiL/CN-DAPS than that of pure CN-DAPS, which is ascribed to the transfer of electrons from CN-DAPS to NiL via intramolecular bond between NiL and CN-DAPS [39]. Table S4 lists the relative ratios of nitrogen species in CN, CN-DAPS, and 3NiL/CN-DAPS. Compared with CN, the ratio of N1C in CN-DAPS increases from 15.69 to 16.50, indicating that CN-DAPS nanosheets become thinner after the copolymerization of urea and DAPS [18]. However, after incorporating with NiL, the ratio of N1C in 3NiL/CN-DAPS is 15.94, lower than that of CN-DAPS (16.50), which is caused by the chemical reaction between the methylol group of NiL and amino group in the edges and backbones of CN-DAPS. The O 1 s peaks of CN-DAPS and 3NiL/CN-DAPS are also different from that of CN (Fig. 3D). CN exhibits a signal peak at 532.0 eV, which belongs to − OH absorbed on the surface [40]. Meanwhile, CN-DAPS exhibits two characteristic peaks at 531.6 and 532.6 eV, revealing the existence of S = O (or CO) and C–O [18,41,42]. SO bond is derived from the doping of DAPS, and CO bond is an isocyanate reactive intermediate. In addition, C–O bond is ascribed to a partial condensation of oxygen on aromatic ring in CN-DAPS. High-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s of 3NiL/CN-DAPS is similar to that of CN-DAPS. In Fig. 3E, 3NiL/CN-DAPS shows two signal peaks at 163.7 and 169.6 eV, indicating the existence of C–S [43] and SO bonds [37]. As shown in Fig. 3F, Ni 2p of 3NiL/CN-DAPS exhibits three characteristic peaks at 855.3, 860.9 and 872.8 eV, contributed by Ni 2p3/2 [44], Ni 2p3/2 satellites peak [45] and Ni 2p1/2 [45], respectively. The result certifies the existence of Ni2+ in 3NiL/CN-DAPS. Furthermore, the characteristic peaks at 197.8 and 199.5 eV of Cl 2p over 3NiL/CN-DAPS in Fig. 3G are ascribed to Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2 of Cl-, respectively, indicating the existence of Ni⋯Cl bond in 3NiL/CN-DAPS [46]. According to XPS analyses, NiL/CN-DAPS was successfully synthesized. The structures of CN, CN-DAPS and xNiL/CN-DAPS were revealed by FT-IR spectra. As shown in Fig. 4 A, all of the photocatalysts display three similar absorption peaks at 810, 1200–1700, and 3000–3400 cm−1, corresponding to breathing vibration of heptazine rings, stretching vibration of C–N and CN of CN heterocycles, and stretching vibration of −NH2 or −OH, respectively [47–49]. The result indicates that the introduction of DAPS and NiL on CN does not destroy its framework. Compared to CN-DAPS, the peaks ascribed to −NH2 or −OH shift to higher wavenumber and the intensity of the broad peaks decreases with increasing loading levels of NiL in xNiL/CN-DAPS. The shifts are attributed to a partial electron transfer from CN-DAPS to NiL [50]. In addition, the weaker intensity of the broad peaks at 3000–3400 cm−1 for xNiL/CN-DAPS indicates the covalent bonding between NiL and CN-DAPS. As depicted in Fig. 4B, pure CN-DAPS exhibits three characteristic peaks located at 1334, 1432, and 1548 cm−1, which are ascribed to C–N heterocycles of the CN-DAPS framework [51]. However, upon increasing loading levels of NiL, the three characteristic peaks become weaker for xNiL/CN-DAPS. Obviously, bonding with NiL promotes the electron transfer from CN-DAPS to NiL thus leading to decreased electron density around CN-DAPS framework of xNiL/CN-DAPS and weaker characteristic peaks of C–N heterocycles. The result demonstrates the successful connection between NiL and CN-DAPS [52]. Because of the low contents of NiL, no characteristic absorption peaks for NiL were observed in the FT-IR spectra of xNiL/CN-DAPS. Photocatalytic generation of hydrogen over CN-DAPS and xNiL/CN-DAPS was evaluated to disclose the role of NiL. As shown in Fig. 5 A, pure CN-DAPS shows no photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. However, upon increasing the contents of NiL, the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of xNiL/CN-DAPS enhances, and the optimal hydrogen production rate reaches 30.67 μmol·h−1 over 3NiL/CN-DAPS. The turn over number (TON) of 3NiL/CN-DAPS is calculated to be 127.8. Compared with 3NiL/CN-DAPS, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of simple deposition of Ni complex (3NiL@CN-DAPS) is 4.65 μmol·h−1, indicating that the covalent bonding between NiL and CN-DAPS exhibits a positive effect for the photocatalytic reaction. Once the hydrogen production activity of xNiL/CN-DAPS arrives at the maximum, further increasing the contents of NiL (4NiL/CN-DAPS and 5NiL/CN-DAPS) leads to decreased photocatalytic activity. It was reported that excess NiL can act as a recombination center for photogenerated electrons and holes during photocatalytic reaction [24,53,54]. As shown in Fig. 5B, the photocatalytic hydrogen production of xNiL/CN-DAPS increases upon extending illumination time. Fig. 5C shows the hydrogen production activity over CN-DAPS and NiL/CN-DAPS under irradiation of light with different wavelengths (λ = 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 nm). Pure CN-DAPS exhibits no photocatalytic activity over the entire range of wavelength, while 3NiL/CN-DAPS generates hydrogen under irradiation of the light in all the examined wavelengths. It can even produce a small amount of hydrogen under 550 and 600 nm light irradiation. The optimum hydrogen generation rate (11.41 μmol·h−1) over 3NiL/CN-DAPS is achieved at the wavelength of 450 nm, and the corresponding AQE is 2.15 %. It is noted that 3NiL/CN-DAPS still exhibits superb photocatalytic activity after 4 cycles in 16 h, indicating that 3NiL/CN-DAPS holds excellent stability (Fig. 5D). UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra (UV–vis DRS) were recorded to analyze the optical properties of CN, CN-DAPS and xNiL/CN-DAPS. As shown in Fig. 6 A, after the copolymerization of urea and DAPS, the absorption of CN-DAPS is significantly broadened in the region of visible light. In addition, increasing contents of NiL leads to enhanced absorption intensity of xNiL/CN-DAPS in the range of visible light. The broadened absorption of visible light is ascribed to the effect of NiL on NiL/CN-DAPS as the electron sinker to prolong the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. More NiL on CN-DAPS framework can act as recombination centers for photogenerated charge carriers, leading to the decrease of absorption intensity and photocatalytic activity (Fig. 5A) [55]. The UV–vis spectrum of 3NiL/CN-DAPS is consistent with its hydrogen production rates under monochromatic light irradiation. The UV–vis DRS of CN, CN-DAPS, 3NiL/CN-DAPS, DAPS, Sample 1, 3L/CN-DAPS, and NiCl2·6H2O are shown in Fig. S3. Different absorption peaks further confirm the successful preparation of NiL/CN-DAPS. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were carried out to study the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers in CN-DAPS and xNiL/CN-DAPS. As shown in Fig. 6B, CN-DAPS and xNiL/CN-DAPS exhibit a broad fluorescence emission peak between 400 and 600 nm, indicating the easy combination of photogenerated electrons and holes [56]. However, with introduction of NiL, the intensity of PL peak of xNiL/CN-DAPS decreases significantly. This phenomenon suggests that chemical combination of NiL and CN-DAPS is improving separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of xNiL/CN-DAPS. In addition, the PL spectra of CN and CN-DAPS are shown in the inset of Fig. 6B. After modification with DAPS, the intensity of PL peak over CN-DAPS reduces significantly than that of CN. Therefore, further modification of NiL on CN-DAPS framework results in lower PL peak but higher photocatalytic activity. To further characterize the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers over CN-DAPS and 3NiL/CN-DAPS, photocurrent-time response curves and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were detected. As shown in Fig. 7 A, both CN-DAPS and 3NiL/CN-DAPS exhibit negative photocurrent response and high stability under visible light irradiation. Notably, the photocurrent response of 3NiL/CN-DAPS is about three times of that of CN-DAPS. Obviously, the higher photocurrent response stands for the higher separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers [19]. Fig. 7B shows the EIS plots over CN-DAPS and 3NiL/CN-DAPS. Compared with CN-DAPS, the semi-circular diameter of the Nyquist curve of 3NiL/CN-DAPS reduces significantly after modification with NiL, indicating the superior migration of charge carriers in 3NiL/CN-DAPS compared to CN-DAPS [57]. According to the photocurrent-time response curves and EIS plots, modification with NiL shows a positive effect on separation of photogenerated carriers and photocatalytic activity of 3NiL/CN-DAPS. Linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) was used to explore the role of NiL during photocatalytic hydrogen production. As shown in Fig. S4, compared to CN-DAPS, the onset potential of 3NiL/CN-DAPS exhibits a positive shift and its photocurrent density increases significantly, demonstrating that the introduction of NiL reduces the overpotential for hydrogen releasing over 3NiL/CN-DAPS, but promotes the reduction of protons or water [58,59]. To further verify the role of NiL on photocatalytic reaction, DFT calculation was performed to simulate the electronic structures of CN, CN-DAPS and NiL/CN-DAPS (Fig. S5). The HOMO of CN is mainly derived from the p z orbital of the nitrogen atom, while the LUMO is from sp2 CN [17,60]. Compared to CN, the distribution of HOMO and LUMO levels of CN-DAPS changes a lot, representing that modifying with in-plane benzene ring promotes the delocalization of HOMO and LUMO of CN-DAPS. For NiL/CN-DAPS, after being attached with NiL, the HOMO and LUMO are mainly derived from CN-DAPS skeleton and NiL. According to DFT calculation, grafting NiL onto CN-DAPS framework effectively promotes the delocalization of π-conjugated electrons and separation of charge carriers, thus enhancing photocatalytic activity of NiL/CN-DAPS. The photocatalytic mechanism of NiL/CN-DAPS under visible light irradiation is proposed and depicted in Fig. 8 [61,62]. Under visible light irradiation, CN-DAPS produces electrons and holes. The photogenerated electrons transfer to CB of CN-DAPS, and the photogenerated holes are captured by TEOA. Furthermore, photogenerated electrons on CB of CN-DAPS transfer to Ni(II)L and forms Ni(I) via intramolecular bond between CN-DAPS and NiL. After adding protons, Ni(I) produces highly active species Ni(III)-H. With the existence of photogenerated electrons, Ni(III)-H is reduced to form Ni(II)-H. In addition, Ni(II)-H generates dihydrogen under extra addition of protons and returns to Ni(II)L."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, a facile photocatalyst composed of a nickel complex and in-plane benzene ring-modified graphitic carbon nitride was synthesized, which aims at efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. Modification of CN with in-plane benzene ring promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes effectively. Intramolecular bonding of NiL with amino group of CN-DAPS framework further enhances the migration of charge carriers. In addition, NiL holds a positive effect on hydrogen releasing. The xNiL/CN-DAPS catalysts display excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, with optimum hydrogen evolution rate of 30.67 μmol·h−1, and AQE of 2.15 % (λ = 450 nm) over 3NiL/CN-DAPS. The successful synthesis of NiL/CN-DAPS provides a guideline for the preparation of non-precious metal photocatalysts for hydrogen generation."
