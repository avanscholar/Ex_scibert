0,Introduction,"Methanol and ethanol are among the most promising renewable fuels that can replace petrochemicals [1]. Due to the intensive use of fossil fuels, there has been an ever increasing trend in the production of polluting gases released into the atmosphere, which has caused climate changes on the earth. Since ethanol is not toxic, it does not contaminate water resources, does not change the natural balance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in contrast to the fossil fuels [2], and can be produced in large amounts from the agriculture products or biomass [3]. It is a green fuel that can be applied directly as a fuel or as a gasoline enhancer among the renewable energy resources. A profound realization of the microscopic behavior of Hydrogen bonded (H-bonded) liquids is essential for many biological and chemical processes. However, the influence of H-bonds on the static and dynamic properties of associated liquids is not well realized. Due to the importance of water in biological systems, a large body of experimental and theoretical studies is aimed at clarifying the details of their structural and dynamical properties in the bulk and in the vicinity of organic [4–9] or inorganic [10–17] materials. Indeed, the other H-bonded liquids such as alcohols remain underexplored. Alcohols with one hydroxyl group are specified by H-bonding patterns which may be regarded, mostly, as cyclic and, partly, as linear structures [18,19] that are very different from the tridimensional network generic of water because of their hydrophobic groups. Also, by changing the alkyl chain length or by going from primary to secondary or tertiary alcohols, the size and shape of alcohol molecules can be changed easily; this, highlights the effect of the hydrophobic parts in the HB network. Finally, against water, alcohols are miscible with a variety of both nonpolar and polar solvents. The behavior of molecules confined in the pore with nanometric dimensions is currently a subject of great interest because it plays an important role in many technological applications such as crevice corrosion processes in boilers [20], the characteristic of steams within geothermal reservoirs [21], the attainment of oil trapped within porous rocks [22], the hydration in highly concentrated sugar solutions [23] and problems with fundamental biological relationship such as the solvation at the surface of proteins [24]. The behavior of ethanol molecules in nanopores has considerable impacts on many chemical and biological processes. It is found that ethanol molecules place themselves near the hydrophobic domain of the pore [25] and block the ion flux within the channel, affording many of the well-known effects of ethanol in humans, such as behavior disorder or anesthesia. Moreover, the behavior of ethanol within the nanopore is significant for the manufacture of fuel-grade ethanol [26], where the nanoporous material is widely used. A suitable physical explanation of the modifications operated in the confined liquid, compared to what is acquired in more usual bulk systems, is necessary to realize how finite size effects influence the behavior of trapped phases. Recently, numerous attempts have been made to clarify the properties of fluids at the interface. Gubbins and his co-workers studied the adsorption and phase equilibrium of simple gas [27,28], water [29–31], and mixtures [32,33] within different nanopores using molecular simulation. Above cited literature and other studies [9,16,34–36] demonstrated that the behavior of confined fluids is essentially specified by the anisotropic fluid-fluid and wall-fluid interactions. The change of interactions could result in significant changes in behavior of the confined fluids. In the case of alcohol molecules, the coexistence of alkyl chain (nonpolar and hydrophobic) and hydroxyl (polar and hydrophilic) groups make the fluid-fluid and wall-fluid interactions more anisotropic. Zhang and his co-workers [37] studied the transport diffusion of water and methanol molecules inside the hydrophobic and hydrophilic pores with MD simulations. They found that methanol has a much higher flux than that of water in the hydrophobic pore. Thus, the separation of water–methanol mixtures in hydrophobic pores is expected. Morineau and his coworkers studied the methanol molecules confined in silica nanopores with MD simulations [38]. Their results demonstrated that H-bonding interaction of methanol and surface significantly affects the local structure of the interfacial methanol. Kaneko and his co-workers [39–41] studied the structure of methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol confined in carbon nanopores using in situ X-ray diffraction. They found that, although all molecules could form ordered structures within the nanopore, only ethanol had a remarkable preferred orientation. While experimental studies use rather indirect methods to investigate H-bonding, a direct experimental measurement about the microscopic properties of confined molecules remains usually difficult [42]. However, computer simulation is a method widely used to obtain direct microscopic information on the statistics and the dynamics of H-bonds and studying the confined behavior within nanoscale [43–45]. From a fundamental point of view, it is interesting to explore similarities and differences between methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol placed in confinements. In this work, we conduct MD simulations at ambient pressures, over a wide range of temperatures to study the structural behavior, diffusion coefficient, the H-bonding statistics and the mean lifetime of H-bonds of alcohols including methanol, ethanol and 1- propanol at the interface, and its comparison to the bulk."
1,Simulation,"In the present work, we have employed our new simulation method [46] in the NAPT ensemble to simulate a constant number N of alcohol molecules confined between graphene surfaces of constant surface area A at constant parallel component of pressure and constant temperature. It should be noted that in this simulation only the confined region is simulated. It is shown that in the NAPT ensemble method, we do not need to simulate in the grand canonicalensemble to establish equilibrium between bulk and confined fluids. Therefore, we simply impose the parallel pressure to 1 bar (the pressure of the bulk sample) [46–50]. Also, the calculation of chemical potentials for LJ fluid in confinement and bulk fluid indicates that the NAPT ensemble guarantees the existence of equilibrium between the bulk sample and the fluid in confinement, unless the pore is very narrow [51]. In this method the system is coupled to a Berendsen thermostat [52] and a barostat by changing the distance between the surfaces dynamically to achieve a constant parallel component of pressure, P | | , defined as [46]: (3) P | | = P x x + P y y 2 = 1 3 V ∑ i m i v i 2 + 1 2 V [ ∑ i ∑ j > i ( X i j · F x , i j + Y i j · F y , i j ) + ∑ i ∑ s ( X i s · F x , i s + Y i s · F y , i s ) ] where P xx and P yy are the x- and y-components of pressure tensor, respectively; m is the atomic mass; v is the velocity; V is the volume; subscripts i and j show the atoms in the confining region; subscripts s stands for the surface atoms, X and Y are the relative distances between particles in the x and y directions, respectively, and F x and F y are their corresponding forces. In order to keep the parallel component of pressure fixed, a proportional scaling of the z-coordinates of all particles per time step from z to μz is necessary. The scaling constant μ is defined as: (4) μ = 1 − β Δ t ( P 0 | | − P | | ) τ P where β is the isothermal compressibility, Δt is the time step, P 0 | | is the target value of the parallel component of pressure, and τ P is the time constant for pressure coupling, determining the strength of coupling to the barostat. That is, in this method, the distance between the surfaces is changed to keep P | | fixed, but the x and y dimensions of the simulation box remain fixed. Since the C atoms involved in graphene surface are immobile, the change in the volume of the simulation box is done by the shifting the z-coordinates of C atoms from z to μz. Here, P | | is fixed to the corresponding bulk pressure. From the surface force apparatus measurements, it is known that the external field, created by the configuration of confined surfaces, varies very slowly from the center of confined region to the bulk [53,54]. Since variation of P | | from the bulk fluid to the confined region depends on the gradient of fluid-surface interactions parallel to the surface, as already reported [55], P | | is essentially the same as the bulk pressure. The three-site LJ plus Coulombic potentials were used to describe the non-bonded interactions of the force field. A reaction field model [56] was used to evaluate the coulombic interactions, i. e., U i j = 4 ε i j [ ( σ i j r i j ) 12 − ( σ i j r i j ) 6 ] + q i q j 4 π ε 0 ( 1 r i j + ε r f − 1 2 ε r f + 1 r i j 2 r c 3 ) where ε ij is the potential well-depth, σ ij is the position at which the LJ potential is equal to zero, r ij is the distance between centers of spheres i and j, q is charge, ε 0 is the permittivity of vacuum, ε rf is the reaction field dielectric, and r c is the cut-off distance. To keep the balance between the available computing time and atomic detail, the united-atom approach is applied: a molecule is represented as a collection of cites, some of which represent a group of atoms, instead of a collection of atoms. An alcohol molecule consists of a hydrogen site, an oxygen site (together forming the hydroxyl group OH), and subsequent sites representing methyl(ene) group (-CHx) centered on the carbon atom. The TraPPE-UA force field [57] is applied for methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol. The force field parameters are tabulated in Table 1 . In this work, YASP simulation package [58] is used. MD simulations are done at constant temperatures, ranging from 260 K to 340 K at 20 K intervals and at a constant parallel component of pressure, 101.3 kPa. The bonds and angles between united atoms of alcohols were constrained by SHAKE algorithm [59,60]. In all simulations the C atoms of graphene surface, modeled as uncharged particles in the graphene surfaces, were kept immobile and periodic boundary conditions were applied in the x and y directions. The force-field parameters for carbon atoms of the graphene surfaces were taken from Eslami et al. [46]. Each graphene surface consists of 364 C atoms; therefore, the box size in x and y dimensions are 3.20 and 2.98 nm. In this simulation the cutoff distance was 1.0 nm and the reaction field correction for the Coulombic interactions [56] was included. An atomic Verlet neighbor list was used, being updated every 15 time steps, and the neighbors were included if they were closer than 1.1 nm. The time step for the leap-frog integration scheme was 1.0 fs, followed by a 6-ns equilibration cycle, and then continuing the simulation for another 4 ns to collect data."
2,Results,
3,Local density profile,"3.1 Local density profile MD simulations were performed in the NAPT ensemble, the simulation box containing alcohol molecules confined between two parallel graphene surfaces. In order to indicate the effect of graphene surfaces on the alcohol structure, the normalized local density profiles of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol in the pore at T = 280 K are shown in Fig. 1 . The local density profile was calculated by dividing the distance between graphene surfaces into 1000 tiny slabs, and computing the time-averaged density for each slab during the simulation. The results in Fig. 1 are indicative of the layered structure of confined fluids in the neighborhood of the surfaces. The results in Fig. 1 show that at a constant bulk pressure, P || = 101.3 kPa and T = 280 K, the local density shows several peaks in the vicinity of each surface, and the intermediate region does not show a layering effect. In this region, the local density has a mean value corresponding to the bulk liquid density. The layering effect seen in Fig. 1 is in accordance with previous reports on the layering of confined fluid [9,46,61–69]. To elucidate the effect of temperature on the layered structure of fluid in the pore, the local density profile of methanol in the pore (at T = 260, 280, and 320 K) is shown in Fig. 2 . Because of the symmetry of the simulation box, the density profiles in half of the box are shown in this Figure. The results are indicative of formation of wider peaks in higher temperature in the vicinity of surface. However, a few molecular diameters, away from the surfaces, about 1.0 nm, the density profiles show bulk-like behavior. Eslami et al. [47,48,70] have previously reported the same length scale for the formation of layered polymer structures beside the surfaces. The average density of various atomic groups in alcohol molecules reduced by the average bulk density of these groups can be seen in Fig. 3 . As we go from methanol to 1-propanol, the size of alkyl (hydrophobe) group increases while the size of hydroxyl (hydrophile) group remains the same. Then, the reduced density of hydroxyl group for methanol near the graphene is greater than ethanol and 1-propanol. However, methyl reduced density is greater than methylene group density in the vicinity of the graphene sheet. This represents that confined alcohol molecules orient themselves with the hydrophobic methyl groups exposing to the two plates, whereas the polar hydroxyl groups stand away from surface to preserve a hydrogen-bonding with adjacent layer. These observations are in line with Ballal et al. [71] and Zhao et al. [72]. Another characteristic of confined molecules is the preferred orientation of certain bonds. The orientation of the different bonds in methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol is checked with respect to a vector, normal to the graphene surface as shown in Fig. 4 . We define three angles between different bonds and the surface normal vector shown for ethanol in Fig. 4. As the results in Fig. 3 indicate, the peaks for density of CH3 and CH2 groups of ethanol approximately appear in the same place. We define α angle between CH3 CH2 bond and the surface normal vector. In Fig. 5 , panel a shows the distributions of cos α versus the distance of surface. The results show that cos α fluctuates around zero then CH3 CH2 bond orients nearly perpendicular to the surface normal vector and is parallel to the graphene surface. θ angle is indicating the orientation of CH3 O in methanol and CH2 O in ethanol and 1-propanol with surface normal vector. In Fig. 5, panel b shows the distribution of cos θ versus the distance of surface. The results in this panel indicate that the behavior of these groups for methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol are the same. Cos θ fluctuates around zero at Z > 1.0 nm; therefore, CH3 O in methanol and CH2 O in ethanol and 1-propanol orient randomly at these distances. The orientation of OH group is indicated with γ angle. The distribution of cos γ versus the distance of surface is shown in Fig. 5, panel c. The results in this panel indicate that OH bond orientation for methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol are the same. Results in this panel show that very close to the surface cos γ is 1 then OH bond orients parallel to the surface normal unit vector then this bond is perpendicular to graphene surface. By increasing the distance from surface, the orientation of OH bond changes and at Z > 1.0 nm orients randomly."
4,Hydrogen bond structure,"3.2 Hydrogen bond structure The hydrogen-bonding interaction plays a critical role in the behavior of alcohols, similar to that of water. A hydrogen bond is determined by a geometric criterion proposed by Luzar et al. [73] That is, two molecules are considered hydrogen-bonded if the two following conditions are satisfied: (a) the distance between the oxygen (O) sites of two molecules is shorter than a threshold distance and (b) the HO⋯ O angle is smaller than a threshold value. In this work, the threshold distance and the threshold angle are taken to be 0.35 nm and 30°. In order to detect the microscopic pictures of HB structure in nanoconfined alcohols, the distance between the graphene surfaces is divided into 1000 tiny slabs. At first, the number of hydroxyl group in each slab is time averaged during the simulation. Normalized density profile for hydroxyl group in the pore is shown in Fig. 6 a for methanol and ethanol and 7a for 1-propanol. The results indicate formation of sharp density profiles of hydroxyl groups in the vicinity of the surface. Then, the normalized numbers of HBs per donor in slabs parallel to the surfaces are calculated (Fig. 6b for methanol and ethanol and 7b for 1-propanol). A similar layering effect is observed in this case. At a position of the maximum density profile peak of hydroxyl group, only a shoulder is seen in the HB profile. However, the HB profile peaks show maxima at place that is corresponding to the positions of minima in density profile peaks. This indicates that majority of HBs between organized alcohol molecules in the neighboring layers are formed. In other words, the donors and acceptors in the neighboring layers orient in such a way to form HBs. To discover the temperature dependency of HB structure, the normalized hydroxyl group density and normalized numbers of HBs per donor for 1-propanol are shown at different temperatures in Fig. 7 a and b; as shown, the number of HBs in confined fluid decreases as temperature increases. The average numbers of HBs, 〈n HB〉, in confined alcohols and bulk have been investigated (not shown). Previous studies [17,69,74] indicated that the average number of hydrogen bonds 〈nHB〉 reduces for confined water compared to the corresponding bulk value. However, the 〈n HB〉 values of confined alcohol molecules are found to be the same as bulk. It is worth to mention that alcohols are specified by H-bonding patterns which may be regarded, mostly, as cyclic and, partly, as linear structure [18,19] that are very different from the complex tetrahedron structure of water. Consequently, the spatial requirement of hydrogen bond formation of the alcohols to form bulk-like hydrogen bonds is less than that of water molecules which is consistent with MD simulation results of Shao et al. [75] They investigated the pore diameter effect of carbon nanotube on the structural properties of confined ethanol molecules. They have found that the confinement effect of CNTs with diameters larger than 1.0 nm, on average number of hydrogen bonds, is little and bulk-like hydrogen bonds are observed in these carbon nanotubes."
5,Hydrogen bond dynamics,"3.3 Hydrogen bond dynamics The HB dynamics of alcohols within the pore was investigated by following time correlation function, originally introduced by Rapaport [76] and used by Chandra [77], Luzar and Chandler [73] and Luzar [78], to study hydrogen bonding in pure water. The intermittent hydrogen bond correlation function, C HB(t), is defined as: C H B ( t ) = 〈 h ( 0 ) h ( t ) 〉 〈 h ( 0 ) 〉 where h(t) represents the characteristic function that equals 1 if the tagged molecule pair is hydrogen bonded at time t and h(t) is zero otherwise. Therefore, CHB(t) illustrates the probability of a pair of alcohol molecules being hydrogen bonded at time t = 0 and still hydrogen bonded at time t, independent of possible breakings in the interim time. The intermittent correlation function, C HB(t), in 0.3 nm thick slabs parallel to the surfaces, for methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol at 300 K is shown in Fig. 8 . The function CHB(t) indicates an initial fact decay at t < 0.5 ps because of the librational motions and depends slightly on the distance from the surfaces. However, the long-time relaxation behavior of CHB(t) depends on the proximity to the surfaces. As the results in Fig. 8 show, CHB(t) decays slower for the slab closer to the surface (0.3 ≤ d ≤ 0.6) compared to farther slab (0.6 ≤ d ≤ 0.9) and bulk. Also, the decay of CHB(t) for methanol is faster than ethanol and 1-propanol. The main reason for the slower decay of CHB(t) for ethanol and 1-propane compared to methanol is the volume of the alkyl groups which decreases the hydrogen bond exchange dynamics in larger alcohols. In Fig. 9 , we have shown the function C HB(t) for ethanol at T = 260 K and 340 K for 0.3 nm thick slabs, parallel to the graphene surfaces, to clarify temperature dependency of hydrogen bond dynamics. As the results in Fig. 9 show, a faster decay of CHB(t) is observed at higher temperature. Faster decay of CHB(t) indicates faster diffusion of fluids at higher temperature. The intermittent correlation function behavior in Fig. 9 indicates that the effect of surfaces on the confined ethanol increases at lower temperature compared to the elevated temperature. The relaxation time τ R of this function is usually called the structural relaxation time of hydrogen bonds. The values of τ R , which are obtained by assuming an exponential decay of C HB(t) as described in Ref. [77] for bulk and confined fluids at 300 K are included in Table 2 . The relaxation of hydrogen bonds at all confined systems is found to be slower than that in the bulk, in agreement with previous finding [17,79]. Increasing the relaxation time and, accordingly, decreasing hydrogen bond exchange dynamics occur with increasing the size of alkyl group. The main reason to the greater reorientation time of hydrogen bonds from methanol to 1-propanol is the volume of the alkyl groups which prevents potential new hydrogen-bonding partners. Also, decreasing the hydrogen bond exchange dynamics in larger alcohols happens, in line with experimental observations [80–85]. This observation is in line with Vartia et al.’s findings [86] who reported slower OH-bond reorientational dynamics in ethanol compared to methanol and water."
6,Translational dynamics,"3.4 Translational dynamics Translational dynamics are usually quantified in terms of a diffusion coefficient. This parameter has been investigated by calculating mean square displacement (MSD) as a function of time. Also, from the slope of the MSD, diffusion coefficient can be extracted. While for confined fluids, total MSD as a function of time does not obey [87] Einstein relation, for in plane MSD, Einstein relation is valid. 〈 r | | 2 〉 = ( x − x 0 ) 2 + ( y − y 0 ) 2 where 〈 r | | 2 〉 is the mean square displacement parallel to the surface over a sufficiently large time interval t. The MSD is related to the diffusion coefficient (D) through the Einstein relation, using the appropriate normalization factor for two dimensional diffusion processes. 〈 r | | 2 〉 = 2 d D | | t where d is the system dimension. Since we calculated the diffusion only in the direction parallel to the interface, d = 2. We compute the center of mass MSD and subsequently the average in-plane diffusion coefficient of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol molecules in the xy plane, i.e., parallel to the graphene surfaces, at 0.3 nm thick slabs (0.3 < d < 0.6 nm) and (0.6 < d < 0.9), as well as those for the bulk at different temperatures. The results are given in Fig. 10 , which represent D|| as a function of temperature for confined alcohols and bulk. A normal Einstein diffusion was observed in all cases. Furthermore, as expected, the confined diffusion coefficients of bulk fluids are obviously larger than that of confined fluids. In agreement with previous studies [88], the smaller diffusion constants are observed for larger alcohols. Also, we observed that D || decreases monotonically near the confining surfaces. The results indicate that molecules located in slabs closer to the surfaces diffuse slower than those in the farther slabs and bulk sample. This is in line with Zhao et al.’s findings [89] who reported increased diffusion coefficient with increased pore size for ethanol and water confined. This demonstrates that the slower diffusion of molecules close to the surfaces cause slower long-time relaxations of function CHB(t) and slower HB exchange dynamics in the region. The activation energy for the diffusion, as reported in Table 3 , is higher in the case of closer slabs to the surfaces than that of the bulk fluids. This is in line with other findings in this work, which indicated an increased effect of confining surfaces on the confined fluid at lower temperatures compared to the higher temperatures."
7,Conclusion,"We have studied the molecular structure and dynamical properties of alcohols at a hydrophobic surface with MD simulation in NAPT ensemble at a constant parallel component of pressure of 101.3 kPa, equal to the bulk pressure, and at constant temperatures, ranging from 260 to 340 K. Our simulation results demonstrate that considerable layered structures are created for the confined alcohols. It is shown that whereas confined alcohol molecules orient themselves with the hydrophobic methyl groups exposing to the two plates, the polar hydroxyl groups stand away from surface to preserve a hydrogen-bonding with adjacent layer, in good agreement with previous results [71,72]. In contrast with confined water, the 〈n HB〉 values of confined alcohol molecules are found to be the same as bulk. The reason is that, the alcohols are specified by H-bonding patterns which may be regarded, mostly, as cyclic and, partly, as linear structures [18,19] that are very different from the complex tetrahedron structure of water. Our results demonstrate that the decay of CHB(t) for methanol is faster than ethanol and 1-propanol. Also, we observe that larger alkyl group size prevents potential new hydrogen-bonding partners. Moreover, decrease in the hydrogen bond exchange dynamics and increase in the relaxation time, τ R, in larger alcohols is found to be in agreement with previous observations [86]. The results show that molecules located in slabs closer to the surfaces diffuse slower than those in the farther slabs and bulk sample. This is in line with finding reported by Zhao et al. [89] in which increasing diffusion coefficient with increasing the pore size was observed. Also, the larger alcohols have smaller diffusion constants and, thus, exhibit slower HB exchange dynamics, in line with previous experimental and theoretical observations [80–85,88]. Increasing the activation energy for the diffusion in the case of closer slabs to the surfaces than that of the bulk fluids indicate that the effect of confining surfaces on the confined fluid increase at lower temperatures compared to the higher temperatures."
