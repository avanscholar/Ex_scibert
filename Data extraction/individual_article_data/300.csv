0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic conversion of alcohols into more valuable carbonyl compounds is promising alternative to traditional thermal catalysis to meet green and sustainable requirements.[1–4] Unfortunately, the photoconversion of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes is far away from industrial application due to the low efficiency in activating the cleavage of the α-C-H bond in the alcohol molecule. Until now, numerous heterogeneous photocatalysts have been applied for the photo-oxidation of alcohols under variable conditions.[5–16] Compared with aerobic photo-oxidation of alcohols, hydrogen can be produced as a valuable coupled product under anaerobic conditions.[17–22] Additionally, since the selective oxidation processes mainly rely on the suitable band structure and abundance of the surface active sites of the photocatalysts, the strategies of nano-architecture aiming at tailoring the band edge position and construct reliable active sites to enhance the selective oxidation reactions are eagerly in need.[23–26] So far, defect engineering has been one of the most popular methods to adjust the intersurface interaction and activate the substrates.[27–30] Suitable defects like oxygen vacancies (OVs) can promote the separation of photo-generated carriers, properly modify the electronic structure and create surface active sites.[31–35] Although water is a green solvent for catalysis, it was not as widely used as solvents like acetonitrile, benzotrifluoride, toluene, dichloromethane, dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).[36–43] Li et al.[44] used CdS@MoS2 for anaerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol using acetonitrile as solvent. Sun et al.[45] applied Pt-loaded g-C3N4 for photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzhydrol under N2 atmosphere. Zhang et al.[46] employed a porous ultrathin g-C3N4 as photocatalyst to investigate the oxidant-free photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol in water. However, the origin of hydrogen has still not been fully elucidated, which has always been a controversially discussed issue in the hydrogen production using aqueous alcohol solutions. In our previous work, wide-band SrTiO3 was structure-tuned to response to visible light by Rh[9] and Fe[6] doping for anaerobic oxidation of alcohols. It was found that with the defective SrTiO3 in water, the coupled H2 production was originating from benzyl alcohol rather than water. However, since the undoped SrTiO3 is not activated under visible light, there is still no comprehensive understanding and direct evidence about the roles of OVs in the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols. Based on the previous work and the promising perspectives of defect engineering[4,6,9,32,47,48], we continue to focus on the surface engineering using narrow-band oxide semiconductors as model photocatalyst for selective alcohol oxidation. As a simple Aurivillius oxide with unique sandwich-liked layered structure, bismuth tungstate shows good performance in water splitting and the degradation of organic contaminants under visible-light irradiation.[49–52] Nevertheless, it should be noted that the photocatalytic efficiency of pure Bi2WO6 is still relatively low, which could originate from the poor light utilization and rapid bulk recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes.[49,53–59] Thus, defective Bi2WO6 and pristine Bi2WO6 were proposed for comparing the anaerobic photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols under visible light. Herein, OV-enriched Ta-doped Bi2WO6 (Ta-BWO) and pristine undoped Bi2WO6 (p-BWO) both loaded with Pt nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and used for the comparison in the selective photo-oxidation of alcohols under anaerobic conditions. The photocatalyst also showed superior stability and preparation reproducibility by repeated catalyst preparation and corresponding photocatalytic performance evaluation. An apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 34.8% in pure benzyl alcohol (BA) solution with Pt loaded Ta-BWO under a monochromatic light source at 420 nm was achieved. Results from DRIFTS, isotope tracing analysis and theoretical simulation reveal that abundant surface OVs favored α-C-H bond activation favoring dehydrogenation and enhanced dissociative chemisorption of alcohols, thus boosting their oxidation efficiency."
1,Experimental methods,
2,preparation of Ta doped Bi2WO6,"2.1 preparation of Ta doped Bi2WO6 The oxygen vacancy-enriched bismuth tungstate samples were synthesized by tantalum substitution via the polymerized complex method. In a typical synthesis for 2% Ta doped Bi2WO6, 4.8997 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.010 mol) was mixed in 6.2 g ethylene glycol with stirring. Then, 7.7 g CA, 0.0049 mol ammonium paratungstate and 36.6 mg TaCl5 were added into the mixture. The resultant was subsequently stirred at 60 °C for 30 min, and then heated at 150 °C for several minutes to promote polymerization and finally gelled into a brown resin. The resin was then heated at 350 °C for 2 h to obtain the precursors. The precursors were then calcined in muffle furnace at 550 °C for 10 h. The as-obtained sample was denoted as x%Ta-BWO, where × represents the Ta doping content. The pristine undoped sample was denoted as p-BWO."
3,preparation of Pt-loaded Ta-doped Bi2WO6,"2.2 preparation of Pt-loaded Ta-doped Bi2WO6 Platinum loading on the doped Bi2WO6 was attained by the photodeposition method. Typically, for 4% Pt-loaded Ta-doped Bi2WO6 sample, 50 mg of the Ta doped Bi2WO6 was dispersed in 30 mL of 20% methanol aqueous solution containing 2 mL H2PtCl4 solution (containing 1 g/L Pt) under light irradiation stirring for 4 h. The as-obtained sample was subsequently washed with deionized water for 10 times to remove other ions that might affect catalytic activity."
4,characterization,"2.3 characterization The morphology and structure of the as-prepared Pt-loaded Ta-doped Bi2WO6 were studied by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6330F, JEOL, Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) of JEM-2200F (JEOL, Japan) operating at 200 kV accelerated voltage. The crystallinity and phase purity of Ta-doped Bi2WO6 were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-β B) with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15432 nm). The ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflection absorption spectra (UV–Vis) were collected by an UV–Vis spectrometer (PGENER-AL TU-1901, Beijing) with BaSO4 as a reference. The photo-luminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (Shimadzu; UV-3600). Electron spin resonance spectra (EPR) were collected using a Bruker A300-10/12 at both room temperature and 77 K. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a MULTILAB2000 electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 W Al Kα radiation. The loading of active metal was detected by a Perkin Elmer Optima-5300DV inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). The evolved gas phase was analyzed using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (TILON LC-D200M). The details of characterization can be found in supporting information."
5,photocatalytic activity evaluation reaction,"2.4 photocatalytic activity evaluation reaction Typically, a mixture of alcohol solution (5 mL, degassed) and Pt-loaded Ta-doped BWO (50 mg) was placed in a reactor, which had been pre-purged with Ar. The reactor was thermostated at 15 °C with a cycling pump. Subsequently, the mixture was irradiated under visible light (λ > 420 nm) using a 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar 300, PerfectLight) combined with a UV cut-off filter. After the reactions, the catalysts were immediately separated from the suspension by filtration through a 0.22 μm membrane filter (Dismic-25, Advantec). The solution was then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography: HPLC (Shimadzu LC10ATVP, UV–Vis detector). The conversion and selectivity of aromatic or aliphatic aldehydes were defined as follows: Conversion (%) =(Caldehydes/C0) × 100 Selectivity (%) = [Caldehydes/(C0-Calcohols)] × 100 where C0 was the initial concentration of aromatic alcohols; Calcohols andCaldehydes were the concentrations of residual aromatic or aliphatic alcohols and the corresponding aromatic or aliphatic aldehydes at a certain time after the photocatalytic reactions, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a shows the XRD patterns of the as-obtained Ta-BWO samples prepared by the polymerized complex (PC) method with different doping amounts of Ta. All samples exhibit a typical orthorhombic structure (JCPDS NO. 73–2020), and no other phase related to Ta was detected.[60] However, a careful magnified comparison of the (131) diffraction peaks in the 2θ range of 28.2–28.8° in the inset shows that the peak positions shift slightly towards lower 2θ values with increasing Ta content. The larger lattice parameter results from the substitution of W6+ by Ta5+, because the ionic radius of Ta5+ (0.064 nm) is larger than that of W6+ (0.060 nm). Moreover, the presence of Ta5+ is verified by XPS shown in Fig. S2. Accordingly, the binding energies of Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2 are 26.0 eV and 27.9 eV, respectively, which correspond to the characteristic peaks of Ta5+.[61,62] In comparison with p-BWO (Fig. 1b), the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of Ta-BWO samples exhibit a more intense continuous absorption in the visible-light region, which could be attributed to the presence of OV-induced defect levels below the conduction band (CB) caused by Ta doping. Additionally, the valence bands (VBs) of p-BWO and 2 %Ta-BWO are located at 2.12 eV and 1.89 eV (vs. NHE) (Fig. S3), respectively, indicating a negative VB shift induced by Ta doping. The morphology characterization (Fig. 1c-d and Fig. S4) shows Pt NPs with diameters of 5–6 nm loaded on 2 %Ta- BWO with 30–50 nm in size. The lattice spacings of 0.312 nm and 0.197 nm are assigned to the (103) plane of Bi2WO6 and the (200) plane of Pt NPs,[63,64] respectively. Notably, Pt nanoparticles are easily to be agglomerated in the sonication process of sample preparation, also when electron beam hits the samples during the TEM observation. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) element mapping analysis (Fig. S5) of Bi, W, O, Ta and Pt displays a homogeneous distribution. The catalytic performance for photocatalytic oxidation in saturated benzyl alcohol (BA) aqueous solution was evaluated under visible light using photocatalysts with different Ta doping content, calcination temperature and Pt loading. All samples exhibit high oxidation selectivity (>99%) to benzaldehyde (Fig. 2 a-c). It turns out that the most active photocatalyst was 2 mol% Ta-BWO calcined at 550 °C with 4 wt% loading amounts of Pt, yielding 202.5 µmol benzaldehyde with equally stoichiometric hydrogen produced simultaneously under visible-light irradiation for 6 h. It is noted that the production rate of benzaldehyde over the Ta-doped catalysts (with doping amount of 2 mol%) is more than two times higher than that over p-BWO with stable photocatalytic activity in five cycles (Fig. 2d). According to the result from the long-time anaerobic photo-oxidation of BA in saturated aqueous solution (Fig. 2e), the amount of produced benzaldehyde during the first 10 min was 130.9 µmol, while the corresponding benzaldehyde production after 6 h was 213.1 µmol, suggesting a decreasing production rate as a function of time, which may be related to an increasing coverage of the photocatalyst surface by the continuously formed products. Anaerobic photocatalytic oxidation of a series of other alcohols over Pt-loaded 2 %Ta-BWO was also evaluated to explore the broad-scope application of Pt-loaded Ta-doped BWO in the highly selective conversion of alcohols (Table S1). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 375 nm (Fig. S6), and the relevant derived life-time parameters are summarized in Table S2[65]. It is noted that the 2 %Ta-doped BWO catalyst possesses an average lifetime of 12.71 ns, which is 3.53 times longer than that of p-BWO, suggesting that the separation of the photogenerated charges over 2 %Ta-BWO is more efficient. The comparison of photocurrent responses of p-BWO and 2 %Ta-BWO (Fig. S7) indicates that under visible light 2 %Ta-BWO achieved a significantly higher photocurrent intensity compared with p-BWO, suggesting an enhanced photo-response, separation and transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of p-BWO and 2 %Ta-BWO (Fig. S8) show that 2 %Ta-BWO exhibited a smaller semicircle diameter arc than p-BWO, also suggesting an improved separation efficiency and mobility of the photogenerated charge carriers. The determination of active species in the photocatalytic oxidation process was carried out by adding appropriate amounts of p-benzoquinone (PBQ), ammonium oxalate (AO), tert-butanol (TBA) as scavengers for photo-generated electrons (e-), holes (h+) and hydroxyl radicals (OH•), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2f, the production of benzaldehyde was largely suppressed in the presence of AO, while the addition of PBQ or TBA did not lead to a significant decrease. Thus, holes play a significant role during the photocatalytic alcohol oxidation reaction and that aggressive radicals such as OH• were not generated in the reaction, thus ensuring the excellent selectivity to aldehyde. The different micro-structures of p-BWO and 2 %Ta-BWO were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy at room temperature (Fig. S9). Characteristic signals of surface oxygen vacancies at g = 2.004 were observed for both samples at room temperature.[66] The OVs in p-BWO can be attributed to natural formation during calcination at 550 °C in the preparation procedure, while for 2 %Ta-BWO, the signal was significantly sharper and approximately twofold higher than that of p-BWO, originating from the substitution of W6+ by Ta5+. In the EPR spectra carried out at 77 K (Fig. 3 a), besides the signal at g = 2.004 assigned to surface OVs, the occurrence of a new signal centered at g = 1.94 is ascribed to W5+ [67] further confirming the generation of OVs due to the substitution of W6+ by Ta5+. It is suggested that the induced OVs via Ta doping result in the enhanced activation of the alcohol substrates. The in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (in situ EPR) spin trapping technique is also used to analyze the reaction intermediates. The in-situ EPR signals collected from the anaerobic reaction system containing benzyl alcohol and 2 %Ta-BWO samples under visible light irradiation are shown in Fig. 3b. Six characteristic EPR peaks were detected when DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide) was added into the reaction system under visible-light irradiation, which can be assigned to a DMPO-carbon centered radical, suggesting the breaking of the α-C-H bonds during alcohol oxidation. In order to clarify the origin of evolved hydrogen gas and to elucidate the relationship between dehydrogenation and the surface micro-structure of photocatalysts, a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) was applied to perform an isotopic labelling study using saturated benzyl alcohol in D2O as reaction solution. Fig. 3c shows that in case of 2 %Ta-BWO loaded with Pt as the photocatalyst, the evolved gas was mainly composed of H2 without emerging signals of HD or D2, indicating that the evolved hydrogen was from the dehydrogenation process of benzyl alcohol. However, a comparative QMS result using p-BWO loaded with Pt as the photocatalyst as depicted in Fig. 3d reveals that there is no significant signal of H2. To further determine the composition of produced gas over p-BWO loaded with Pt, a secondary electron multiplier detector was used to magnify and distinguish the signals from the background. The inset image clearly shows a certain amount of HD generated during the photoreaction over p-BWO without any signals of H2 and D2, suggesting produced H2 was composed of hydrogen from both benzyl alcohol and water. Such contrasting gas compositions from the undoped and Ta-BWO photocatalysts indicate that direct cleavage of α-C-H bond is more dominant in the photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol in case of enriched oxygen vacancies. Combined with the EPR results, this observation suggests that benzyl alcohol oxidation via dehydrogenation depends on the surface micro-structure of the photocatalysts. Moreover, the favored dehydrogenation process boosts the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. To further clarify the surface interaction between alcohols and the photocatalysts with different surface structure, diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform (DRIFT) measurements on both p-BWO and 2 %Ta-BWO using IPA as a probe molecule were carried out (Fig. 4 a, 4b). DRIFT spectra in the range of 1000–3100 cm−1 were recorded at room temperature. After the degassing pretreatment, a spectrum was collected on the clean surface and used as background. Several new peaks appeared after the introduction of IPA vapor (with pressure increasing from 0.001 mbar to 1 mbar) into the system for both the pristine and doped samples. The emerging peaks at 1164 cm−1 and 1128 cm−1 are attributed to υC-C and υC-O of the isopropoxy species, respectively, indicating the dissociative chemisorption of IPA[68]. Intense peaks at 2972 cm−1, 2931 cm−1 and 2867 cm−1 and also weak peaks at 1381 cm−1 and 1462 cm−1 are ascribed to υC-H stretching of the methyl group of IPA.[68–71] Concerning that non-dissociative adsorption mode of IPA could also be included on the spectra, we compared the intensity ratios of the band at 1128 cm−1 to the band at 2972 cm−1 in order to evaluate the extent of dissociative chemisorbed IPA on p-BWO and 2 %Ta-BWO samples during the progressively varied dosing of IPA from 0.001 mbar to 1 mbar (Fig. 4c-f). [6,9] It is found that the intensity ratio of υC-O/υC-H on 2 %Ta doped BWO is almost 2 or even 3 times higher than that of the undoped sample, especially when the dosing pressure is as low as 0.001 mbar, demonstrating that the dissociative chemisorption of IPA is much more favorable on 2 %Ta-BWO than on p-BWO. Furthermore, a peak at 1670 cm−1 attributed to the υC=O vibration indicates the presence of adsorbed acetone (Fig. 4c-d). Its blue shift to 1695 cm−1 (Fig. 4e-f) reveals the desorption of acetone.[72,73] It is implied that trace amounts of adsorbed acetone could be produced on the surface of 2 %Ta-BWO, however, there is no sign of the formed acetone on p-BWO under the same conditions. We conclude that 2 %Ta-BWO possesses a higher ability for the dissociative adsorption of IPA and the dehydrogenation of the α-C-H bonds in the alcohol molecule compared with that of p-BWO due to the presence of abundant surface OVs on the doped sample in good agreement with the QMS and EPR results. All the experiment results suggest that the OV-enriched Bi2WO6 photocatalyst induces more dissociative chemisorption of alcohols and the dehydrogenation of α-C-H bonds is favored compared with the undoped Bi2WO6, resulting in the complete dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to form benzylaldehyde in the anaerobic photo-oxidation reaction in water. DFT calculations were employed to describe the energy and structural features in p-BWO and 2 %Ta-BWO. On both p-BWO and 2 %Ta-BWO, the O atom of the hydroxyl group of IPA occupies the oxygen vacancy and forms a strong bond to the metal atoms. The theoretical simulation of the dissociative chemisorption of IPA on the photocatalyst surface shows that the IPA binding energy of −8.01 eV at OVs sites on 2 %Ta-BWO (Fig. 5 a) was relatively lower than that of −7.79 eV on undoped p-BWO (Fig. 5b), suggesting that IPA is more favorable to be chemisorbed on the defective sites of 2 %Ta-BWO. Additionally, the dissociation energy of the α-C-H bond in the chemisorbed IPA molecule was also calculated. It turns out that the α-C-H bond in the chemisorbed IPA on OVs-enriched 2 %Ta-BWO was weaker compared with that on undoped p-BWO. All the theoretical simulation results are fully in line with the DRIFTS results. Based on the experimental results and the DFT simulations, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic anaerobic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and hydrogen evolution in water over Pt-loaded OVs enriched 2 %Ta-BWO is proposed. Initially, the alcohol molecules can be dissociatively adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy sites, resulting in a weakened α-C-H bond. Under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated holes can oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with cleavage of the weakened α-C-H bond. Subsequently, both the released hydrogen from the α-C-H bond and the proton of the hydroxyl group in benzyl alcohol molecule are reduced to H2 by the photogenerated electrons accumulated on Pt. Efficient chemisorption of benzyl alcohol molecules on oxygen vacancy sites is considered essential to facilitate the cleavage of α-C-H bond by the photogenerated holes and efficiently separate the photogenerated carriers, thus boosting the photo-dehydrogenation process."
7,Conclusions,"To summarize, a boosted conversion of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds with high selectivity and stoichiometric hydrogen evolution as coupled product was successfully achieved through the introduction of surface oxygen vacancies on Bi2WO6 by doping with Ta. The presence of surface oxygen vacancies induces more dissociative chemisorption of alcohols with weakened α-C-H bond, resulting in the complete photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde in water and the significantly improved photocatalytic conversion of alcohols. This work not only clarifies the role of oxygen vacancies in activating the α-C-H bonds for improving the conversion rate of alcohol oxidation with high selectivity, but also provides a mild and eco-friendly design of oxide semiconductors with enriched oxygen defects for efficient organic transformation utilizing solar energy."
