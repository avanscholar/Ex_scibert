0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic residues have been extensively studied as potential feedstock for fermentative biofuel production. Among the different lignocellulosic residues, agricultural residues seem to be most abundant according to estimates of Food and Agriculture Organization. Rice straw is one such agricultural residue that is produced abundantly as a byproduct of rice crop with an annual worldwide production of 800 Mt [1]. In Taiwan, rice straw waste generation is equal to 30% of its annually produced agricultural wastes (6.5 × 106 tonnes). Disposal of such high quantity of the rice straw waste is not only a daunting task but also results in environmental pollution problems and squanders natural biomass resources. Rice straw contains bound sugars in the form of cellulose and hemicellulose entangled with the lignin moieties [2]. This makes rice straw amenable to fermentation upon processing through an efficient pretreatment method. Moreover, the utilization of rice straw is more likely to yield far better overall prospects for economic and environmental sustainability. Recent advances in biohydrogen production technologies from lignocellulosic residues have shown the possibility of using rice straw, rice husk, wheat straw and sorghum waste for energy generation [3–7]. Hydrogen generated from these residues can be categorized as “2nd generation hydrogen” since its production does not compete with food crops. In other words the use of lignocellulosic residues to produce hydrogen is defined as the 2nd generation hydrogen [8]. However, all these residues require a pretreatment step to liberate the sugars entrapped in lignin prior to dark fermentation for biohydrogen production, and this make the process intricate and costly. However, the mixed cultures from sources like anaerobic digested sludge, cowdung, compost etc. could serve as an ideal source of hydrolytic microorganisms. The major microbial species in dark fermentation process belongs to Clostridium group which are spore-forming bacteria and resistant to heat environment [9]. Using heat-treated seed sludge to obtain dominant microbes for hydrogen production is well reported [10,11]. Each organism has a pH range within which growth is possible and this pH range usually has a well-defined pH optimum [9]. In any biohydrogen production system, pH affects process efficiency in terms of substrate utilization, hydrogen production activity, and distribution of liquid product or microbial community. To what extent pH affects rice straw-degrading mixed anaerobic microflora for hydrogen production has seldom been elucidated. In addition substrate concentration is also an important key for hydrogen production [10]. Hu et al. [12] have found the surface area and particle size of cellulose to be important substrate characteristics in determining the initial rates of hydrolysis. To develop biohydrogen production technology based on untreated lignocellulosic residues, it is essential to identify the process conditions and parameters in the enhancement of biohydrogen production using mixed cultures from such residues. This study deals with rice straw utilization for sustainable biohydrogen generation. The conversion of untreated rice straw wastes into biohydrogen using different types of sludges and its further improvement by optimizing process conditions such as initial cultivation pH, substrate concentration and particle size, is investigated. The present study report improved biohydrogen production from rice straw without any pretreatment step using mixed cultures."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and substrate,"2.1 Seed sludge and substrate The seed sludges were collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plants (Sludge S1), a paper manufacturing plants (Sludge S2) and cowdung compost (Sludge S3) located in central Taiwan. For test studies all the sludges were heat-treated at 95 °C for 40 min to enrich the fermentative microbial flora whereas for control studies no pretreatment was done. Rice straws were obtained from a rice field in central Taiwan and then powdered to five particle sizes (<0.297, 0.297–0.58, 0.58–1.19, 1.19–10 and >10 mm) with the test sieves prior to use as the substrate. The rice straw concentrations were between 30 and 120 g TS/L (w/v). The feed medium contained sufficient inorganic supplements in the following composition (g/L): NH4HCO3 5.24, K2HPO4 0.125, MgCl2•6H2O 0.1, MnSO4•6H2O 0.015, FeSO4•7H2O 0.025, CuSO4•5H2O 0.005, CoCl2•5H2O 0.000125 and NaHCO3 6.72 [13]."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up 2.2.1 Batch mode The batch experiments were carried out in serum vials (125 mL) with a working volume of 60 mL filled with 25 mL of seed sludge, 10 mL supplement solution and 20 mL of substrate. The vials were initially flushed with argon to remove oxygen from the headspace and maintain anaerobic environment. The vials were incubated in a reciprocal air-bath shaker at 150 rpm with the temperature controlled at 55 °C. The initial cultivation pH was adjusted from 3.5 to 8.0 with an interval of 0.5 units. The volume and composition of gas and VFAs produced after the fermentation were determined. All experiments were carried out in triplicates. 2.2.2 Repeated-batch mode Using the optimal conditions obtained in the batch experiments, a repeated-batch experiment on a working volume of 1.5 L was performed. The reactor was made of glass with a magnetic stirrer at the bottom for continuous stirring. The operation pH was 6.5 and temperature of 55 °C with substrate concentration of 90 g TS/L. Four runs were carried out with each run terminated when the hydrogen content in the biogas dropped below 10%. At the end of each run, half working volume of reactor was replaced with fresh rice straw of 90 g TS/L as substrate."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis 2.3.1 Chemical analysis The analytical procedures of Standard Methods [14] were used to determine pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), total solid (TS), total chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentrations in the liquid content of the samples. Ethanol and VFAs were analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC-14, Japan). Biogas volume was determined by a glass syringe and gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). Other analytical details for the VFAs, ethanol and biogas assays were the same as those indicated in the previous studies [15,16]. Anthrone-sulfuric acid method was used to measure total carbohydrate concentration [17]. 2.3.2 Microbial analysis Total genomic DNA was isolated from the samples collected in repeated-batch experiments using the Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taiwan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer pair EUB968F (5′- CGC CCG GGG CGC GCC CCG GGC GGG GCG GGG GCA CGG GGG GAA CGC GAA GAA CCT TAC-3′) and UNIV1392R (5′-ACG GGC GGT GTG TRC-3′) were used to amplify partial 16S rRNA gene to generate a DNA fragment suitable for DGGE analysis. Each PCR (polymerase chain reaction) mix (50 μL) contained 200 μM deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 μM each primer set, and 1.25U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, USA). The amplification was performed with an automatic thermocycler iCyclerTM (BioRad, U.S.A.), and consisted of a denaturing step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR-amplified rDNA fragments were assessed using DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) by using DCode™ Universal Mutation Detection System (BioRad, U.S.A.). The 6% (w/v) acrylamide solution was used to cast a gel with denaturant gradients ranging from 35 to 65%. Electrophoresis was conducted in 1X TAE (Tris/acetic acid/EDTA) buffer solution at 100 V and 60 °C for 16 h. The gels were stained for 10 min with ethidium bromide and visualized under a UV transilluminator. The DGGE bands were excised and then purified using the Centrilutor microelectroeluter system (Millipore, Rockville, MD, USA). The purified DNA fragments were re-amplified under the reaction conditions described above. The resulting PCR products were sequenced and identified through BLAST search similarity. 2.3.3 Data analysis The hydrogen production potential, maximum hydrogen production rate and lag phase time under each experimental condition were obtained from the modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) [18]. (1) H ( t ) = P · exp { − exp [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } H(t) is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL); P is the hydrogen production potential (mL); Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h); e is 2.71828; λ is the lag phase time (h) and t is the cultivation time (h). The cumulative hydrogen production curve was non-linearly modeled using Eq. (1) and the parameters P, Rm and λ were estimated using Sigmaplot software 10.0 (Systat Software Inc., USA)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of different seed sludge on biohydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of different seed sludge on biohydrogen production For efficient biohydrogen production from renewable feedstock, it is essential to have potential mixed microorganisms which can hydrolyze and ferment the feedstock to generate biohydrogen. It is therefore important to test sludges from different sources that harbor microorganisms of varied type and activity [3,19,20]. Ren et al. [21] have reviewed the hydrogen production potential of lignocellulosic biomass using different sources of inoculums/sludge. In the present study 3 sludges from different sources (municipal waste treatment plant, paper mill and cowdung compost) were tested for biohydrogen production from untreated rice straw. Table 1 summarizes the data obtained from these 3 tested seed sludges during batch fermentation of raw rice straw wastes (30 g TS/L, particle size <0.297 mm) into hydrogen and methane at initial pH 6.5 and temperature of 55 °C. Among the 3 sludges, the peak cumulative hydrogen production (213 mL/L) and hydrogen production yield (7.1 mL/g TS) was obtained using heat-treated seed sludge S1. A nearly 1.5-fold increase in total hydrogen production was obtained upon heat-treatment showing selection of hydrogen producers and elimination of microorganisms consuming hydrogen. Methane production was not detected in any of the 3 seed sludges upon heat-treatment. Previous studies had revealed that the thermal enrichment can enhance most anaerobic sludges to increase hydrogen production [22]. Heat-treatment can enrich the anaerobic hydrogen-producing microorganisms that can tolerate high temperature and can also inhibit other bacteria [10]. The microbial analyses in this study also indicate that these microorganisms are mostly spore-forming bacteria. The soluble metabolic products (SMPs) composition and concentration after the anaerobic fermentation with non-treated and heat-treated sludges were measured to identify the probable major metabolic pathway. The non-treated sludges after 240 h cultivation with rice straw showed SMPs concentration of 1244–2325 mg COD/L and ethanol (EtOH) concentration of 43–98 mg COD/L. The major SMP detected with non-treated sludges were acetate (HAc, 506–1698 mg COD/L), propionate (HPr, 104–358 mg COD/L), butyrate (HBu, 116–414 mg COD/L) and valerate (HVa, 19–70 mg COD/L). In contrast, the SMPs concentrations with heat-treated sludges showed 114–391% increase as compared to non-treated sludges. The heat-treated sludges after 240 h of cultivation on rice straw showed SMPs concentration of 5063–6429 mg COD/L and EtOH of 768–1042 mg COD/L. The major SMPs detected in case of heat-treated sludges were HAc (3070–4261 mg COD/L), HPr (228–486 mg COD/L), HBu (531–566 mg COD/L) and HVa (64–303 mg COD/L). The results reveal that HAc is the dominant SMP formed during dark fermentation of rice straw. It is well reported that fermentation pathway depends on the type of substrate and bacterial metabolism, and studies have in fact shown different pathways of hydrogen production. Lin et al. [22] reported acetate and butyrate as the main end-products of carbohydrate fermentation by Clostridium species and follow butyrate-pathway. Abreu et al. [19] found different major end-products in granular and suspended sludges, and reported ethanol/butyrate and butyrate/acetate pathways in these sludges respectively. Our study with municipal waste treatment plant sludge (S1) shows that hydrogen production from raw rice straw follow acetate-type pathway."
7,Effect of initial cultivation pH,"3.2 Effect of initial cultivation pH Rice straw concentration of 30 g/L with particle size <0.297 mm and heat-treated sludge S1 were used as the substrate and seed, respectively, to investigate the effect of initial cultivation pH on hydrogen production efficiency. There was no gas production in the initial pH values of 3.5–5.5. However, at higher pH hydrogen production was observed. The hydrogen production (mL/L) was 41, 223, 169, 10 and 12 with the initial cultivation pH values of 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. The result indicates that optimal initial cultivation pH for raw rice straw fermentation to hydrogen should be in the range of 6.0–7.0 (Fig. 1 ). Different types of sludges might have different range of pH sensitivity, for e.g. Abreu et al. [19] indicated that granular sludge can be used for larger pH ranges without reducing its capacity to consume sugars and achieve higher hydrogen production potentials. However, a proper control of initial cultivation pH is still important since it can affect the fermentation pathway and enhance hydrogen production. The amount of total volatile fatty acids (TVFAs), which includes HAc, HPr, HBu and HVa, ranged from 80 to 150 mg COD/L at pH 3.5–5.5 with no gas production and 6000–8300 mg COD/L at pH 6.5–8.0. Desvaux et al. [23] indicated that low pH (less than 6.0) was unsuitable for cellulose hydrolyzing microorganisms. Fig. 1 reveals that EtOH (38–41%) was the main SMP at pH 3.5 and 4.0 whereas acetate was the major (63–81%) SMP, when the initial cultivation pH was in the range of 4.5–8.0.The HY and acetate production showed increase with increasing pH up to 6.5, however, pH higher than 6.5 led to reduction in HY. Although acetate production remained high even up to pH 8 possibly a result of activation of acidogenic pathway."
8,Effects of rice straw particle size and concentration,"3.3 Effects of rice straw particle size and concentration To investigate the effect of rice straw particle size on cumulative hydrogen production, the meshed rice straw concentration of 30 g TS/L with five particle sizes (<0.297, 0.297–0.58, 0.58–1.19, 1.19–10 and >10 mm) were used as the substrate for hydrogen fermentation with heat-treated seed sludge S1 at initial cultivation pH 6.5 and temperature of 55 °C. The results showed that the peak cumulative hydrogen production obtained from rice straw particle size <0.297 mm (Table 2 ) was 191 mL/L with an HY of 6.4 mL/g TS (0.67 mL/g VSS). An extended lag phase and much lower hydrogen production was observed with rice straw particle size >0.297 mm. It is evident from the result that fine particle size could help dramatically in the improvement of hydrogen production from raw rice straw probably due to increased substrate availability to microbial hydrolysis and fermentation. However, the particle size did not affect the SMPs concentrations and the main SMP was acetate and represented 47–57% of total SMPs as revealed from the ratio of B/A (butyrate/acetate). The cumulative hydrogen production from the various rice straw concentrations with particle size <0.297 mm and heat-treated sludge S1 at initial cultivation pH 6.5 is illustrated in Table 3 . It was observed that the cumulative hydrogen production increased with the increase in rice straw concentrations from 30 to 90 g TS/L. The peak cumulative hydrogen production was 744 mL/L at 90 g TS/L with a peak HY of 24.8 mL/g TS. More than 3 fold increase was observed in the hydrogen yield when raw rice straw concentration was increased from 30 to 90 g/L. The results indicate that an increase in substrate concentration could drastically affect the cumulative hydrogen production, and rice straw concentration higher than 120 g TS/L inhibits the hydrogen production. Similar results were also noted during the conversion of wheat straw into hydrogen with cowdung compost [24]. SMPs increased with the increase in rice straw concentrations as shown in Table 3. The SMPs concentration (17,185 mg COD/L) obtained with 120 g TS/L rice straw was more than 3 times the SMP concentration (5088 mg COD/L) with 30 g TS/L rice straw. Similar trend was noted for the concentration of EtOH. In contrary, the acetate content in SMPs decreased from 66.3% to 35.9% with the increase in rice straw concentrations from 30 to 120 g TS/L. The high amount of substrate might have redirected the acetate pathway to the ethanol pathway and this indicates that high cellulosic content induces ethanol production and the fermentation process favors more alcohol production than hydrogen and acetate."
9,Repeated-batch operation of raw rice straw fermentation to hydrogen,"3.4 Repeated-batch operation of raw rice straw fermentation to hydrogen From the batch tests results, following optimal operation conditions were found: rice straw concentration of 90 g TS/L with particle size <0.297 mm as the substrate and heat-treated sludge (S1) as the seed. These conditions were used for the scale up studies under repeated-batch operation with a working volume of 1.5 L, initial pH of 6.5 and temperature of 55 °C to produce hydrogen. Fig. 2 shows the cumulative hydrogen production and hydrogen content in biogas. Biphasic hydrogen fermentation was observed based on the hydrogen production in all runs. For the Run 1, the first phase hydrogen production was from the cultivation time of 16–27 h, and the peak hydrogen content (27%) was obtained at 22 h. However, the second phase hydrogen fermentation started from the 27 h and the maximum hydrogen content was 64% at 115 h. Then, the Run 1 was ended at 115 h with hydrogen content of 10%. The cumulative hydrogen production decreased from 1177 mL in Run 1–282 mL in Run 4. The reduction in hydrogen production and content could be due to accumulation of residual substrate leading to substrate inhibition during consecutive runs. From the optimization studies with different substrate concentrations in this study, a concentration higher than 120 g TS/L was found inhibitory. A modified Gompertz equation was fitted to the cumulative hydrogen production curves of the four runs. The parameter values during repeated-batch runs for the hydrogen production potential (P), maximum hydrogen production rate (Rm ) and lag phase time (λ) are given in Table 4 . The results indicated that P and Rm decreased with consecutive runs, whereas λ increased in the Run 4. The increase in λ suggested the reduced growth of biomass and microbial activity leading to delayed start of hydrogen production. The results indicate that repeated feeding of the reactor with same concentration of the substrate led to washout of microbial biomass and accumulation of substrates. This ultimately led to reactor overloading and failure to produce hydrogen in Run 4. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genes coding for 16S rRNA was carried out to identify the microorganisms in the repeated-batch system at different location in the reactor. Samples from different levels of the reactor were analyzed and it was observed that all the levels had similar communities demonstrating even distribution of bacterial species in the reactor. In fact the continuous stirring of the reactor has distributed the microbial population evenly inside the reactor. The major DGGE bands sequenced and identified belong to Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium stercorarium and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (Fig. 3 ). The microbial community analysis reveal the presence of both hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria in the sludge which have in association carried out the fermentative hydrogen production from raw rice straw. Fardeau et al. [25] investigated that C. stercorarium can convert cellulose to hydrogen and carbon dioxide and produce acetate, lactate, and ethanol during the fermentation. Wang et al. [26] also reported that Clostridium species in heat-treated activated sludge were the most commonly identified bacteria responsible for hydrogen production. Our study suggests that dark fermentation of raw rice straw using mixed cultures (hydrolytic and fermentative) at thermophilic temperature could possibly be an inexpensive process to produce biohydrogen from lignocellulosic residues avoiding the pretreatment step."
10,Conclusions,"Hydrogen production from untreated rice straw using heat-treated mixed anaerobic cultures was pH and substrate size- and concentration-dependent resulting from acetate-type fermentation. The optimal pH value for heat-treated sludge S1 to produce hydrogen was 6.5 with peak HY of 7.4 mL/g TS. The increase in rice straw concentration affected the hydrogen production and a very high substrate concentration (120 g TS/L) decreased the hydrogen production. However, repeated-batch operation results indicated gradual decrease in the hydrogen production potential over several runs due to substrate overloading in the reactor. Both hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria were found upon microbial analysis of the heat-treated sludge S1 during repeated-batch fermentation. This study demonstrated that dark fermentation of raw rice straw using optimized conditions with mixed cultures at thermophilic temperature can improve the hydrogen yield and thereby the prospects of producing hydrogen from lignified crop residues avoiding the pretreatment steps."
