0,Introduction,"The global overall energy consumption is six times what it was in 1950, and is expected to increase by as much as 55% by 2030 due to population growth and higher living standards [1]. In addition, the water resources are diminishing as a result of these effects. Renewable internal freshwater resources have decreased about 40% in the past 50 years [2]. According to the present trends, these numbers are projected to increase for the future as well [3]. Hence, it is of importance to draw more attention to the sustainable development of water treatment and energy systems, in order to tackle the issue of energy and water scarcity. The systems based on renewable energy sources can be the part of the solution if they are combined with another system due to the intermittent nature of renewables. Hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant element in the universe and recognized as a carbon-free, storage medium and energy carrier. However, it is not inherently present in nature, but may be produced by means of several processes such as electrolysis, gasification, thermochemical splitting. Approximately 50% of global H2 production is currently realized by natural gas steam reforming and around 48% of other fossil fuels (30% from oil/naphtha reforming and 18% from coal gasification) [4]. Water electrolysis is the most well-known method for hydrogen production. Nevertheless, it requires high electric power requirement with water as the substrate. Abdalla et al. [5] have reported that electrolysis process has to be improved in order to compete the common H2 production technique such as steam methane reforming. Instead of using clean water for hydrogen production, wastewater can be used. In addition for more environmentally benign outcomes solar energy can be utilized as the power source for hybrid solar thermal system [6] and integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) system [7]. In this vein, many studies focus on systems which can produce hydrogen and treat wastewater in situ. Simultaneous hydrogen production and wastewater treatment can be attained by several processes such as biological, electrochemical, photo-electrochemical or combination of these processes. While biological methods are using living organisms to break down to organic compounds for hydrogen production, electrochemical treatment methods are mostly based on degradation of organic substance biologically by various kind of oxidants which are manufactured by the electrochemical processes. Photo and dark fermentation are the most common methods for the biological hydrogen yield [8]. However, in these methods, oxygen has a strong inhibitory effect because oxygen reduces the activity of hydrogenase enzyme which is responsible for hydrogen synthesis. When oxygen present in the environment, the electrons coming from the splitting of water molecules are used for the reduction of carbon dioxide not for the hydrogen evaluation [9]. Furthermore, the light conversion efficiency of photofermentation is relatively low. Nath et al. [10] achieved 0.51% light conversion efficiency and dark fermentation products contains carbon dioxide (CO2) which requires a further process for separation [9]. On the other hand, the electrochemical water splitting can supply high hydrogen purity [11]. Park et al. [12] designed a multi-layered electrode for the oxidation of chemical pollutants coupled with the H2 production to achieve synergistic enhancement. BiOx based electrodes are utilized as electrocatalysts for the treatment of chemical contaminants in water. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is also used as photocatalyst during the processes. The electrochemical oxidation of the pollutant is initiated by generating reactive species that are sorbed on from the employed anode surface. Oxidation of the organic matter was improved by 70% under the light. Despite all the advantages of the electrochemical methods, they have relatively high electric potential (around 2 V in practice) requirement of them limits their applications. By using semiconductor-based photoelectrodes, electric consumption during the process can be reduced. The photocatalytic reaction starts as the photons reach to the photocatalytic surface and are absorbed as a result of electron-hole pairs. In that process, the vast amount of the reducing power of formed electrons allows them to reduce some metals and dissolved oxygen (O2) in superoxide radical ion form. The remaining electron holes can oxidize adsorbed water to reactive hydroxyl radicals which are highly reactive and widely used in water treatment applications [13]. Selcuk et al. [14] investigates the disinfection and formation of disinfection by-products in a photoelectrocatalytic treatment system which utilizes TiO2 as the photocatalyst. The disinfection performance of TiO2 is evaluated through the use of Escherichia coli. Salgado et al. [15], conducted experimental studies towards solar driven photocatalytic hydrogen production methods. Gold (Au)/TiO2 is utilized as the photocatalyst in the PEC reactor. Various kind of wastes are tested including sewage wastewater, industrial wastewater and alcohol. Furthermore, the effect of ionic strength on the production is investigated. Au/TiO2 as a photocatalyst showed satisfactory results for hydrogen production. Another way to reduce the energy requirement in water splitting process is the replacement of the anodic reaction of O2 generation. Switching the oxygen evaluation by iron oxidization in anode via the Fenton-like process is one of these methods. It is possible to have a 69% decrease in required energy for the anodic electrochemical reaction with this reaction compare to oxygen evaluation [16]. Solis et al. [16], propose a system which is combining hydrogen production and electro-Fenton oxidization process in an electrolyzer. While the Fenton-type process is decolorizing the textile wastewater in the anode side, hydrogen is also simultaneously manufactured on the cathode side. The developed reactor supplies the energy for the electrolysis from a photovoltaic (PV) array. The decolorization process is driven by electro-Fenton-like process. In order to conduct Fenton-type processes, Fe+2/Fe+3 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) should be supplied to the waste. The proposed reactor provides these ions by the sacrificial of the stainless steel anode. Hence, as long as H2O2 introduced into the system, the Fenton-like process is able to take place. Since Fenton reaction is more effective at acidic mediums, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is selected as the electrolyte in the study. This process can be enhanced by utilizing photocatalysts which also have been used in oxidation processes [17]. Various researchers have investigated individual methods of the hydrogen production and wastewater treatment applications. However, studies on simultaneously Fenton-reaction and hydrogen production systems are limited in the literature. In addition, photocatalysts, have been used in oxidation processes. Nevertheless, the utilization of ultraviolet radiation and photocatalyst is not sufficient only by itself. Here in a novel method, a new hybrid configuration is presented that combines three different photo-assisted advanced oxidation processes such as photoFenton, ultraviolet (UV)/TiO2, and UV/H2O2. A new experimental setup is designed and constructed for simultaneous hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. Moreover, induced photocurrents by the photoanode and switching the anode reaction of oxygen evaluation with the iron oxidation reduces the external electrical power input to the reactor Hydrogen production and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate of the reactor under various circumstances are studied. The study is conducted as a part of the doctoral thesis. For further information about the background reference [18] can be examined. Thermodynamic analysis of the system is done and performance assessment of the reactor is evaluated energetically and exergetically."
1,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"All the experiments are conducted under batch mode in the rectangle shaped glass reactor with a volume of 30 L. The TiO2 nanoparticles coated stainless steel photoanode with an active area of 180 cm2 and a graphite rod cathode are used as electrode pairs in the reactor. The sol–gel dip coating technique is applied to coat titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the surface of the stainless steel electrode. The photoactivity of the photoanode is tested under solar simulator light in 0.05 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) electrolyte. For further information regarding the implemented dip-coating procedure in this study and its outcomes, research conducted by Chehade et al. on the topic can be examined [19]."
2,Titanium dioxide nanoparticles synthesis and deposition,"2.1 Titanium dioxide nanoparticles synthesis and deposition In the study, the “sol” used for coating TiO2 nanoparticles on the stainless steel electrode is synthesized from 25 ml titanium (IV) isopropoxide (C12H28O4Ti), 5 ml acetic acid (CH3COOH), 500 ml of deionized water and 3.5 ml nitric acid (HNO3). In order to achieve nanoparticle synthesis, the solution is heated up to 80 °C for 30 min, and the temperature is kept constant for 2 h via a temperature controller and magnetic stirrer while the pH value is adjusted to a value of 1. Following synthesis, the stainless steel anode is immersed into the sol-gel and withdrawn with a speed of 2.5 mm/s. After 30 times of dipping, the electrode is left for drying by natural convection under room temperature. Afterward, the coated electrode is placed in a vacuum furnace for further heat treatment. The furnace temperature is set to a temperature ranging from 50 °C to 500 °C by increments of 15 °C/min, and the temperature is kept constant at 500 °C for 30 min. Finally, the coated TiO2 photo anode in cooled down to room temperature in the vacuum furnace to avoid any oxidation and then stored in a dark compartment prior to testing."
3,Electrolyte preparation,"2.2 Electrolyte preparation Reactive Black 5 (RB5) and sucrose (C12H22O11) are dissolved in water to simulate the textile and food industry wastewater respectively. While preparing synthetic wastewaters, 0.025 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) is added to the solution to ensure the ionic conductivity of the solution is sufficient. Also, to determine the effect of wastewater on hydrogen production, another electrolyte is prepared by mixing water with 0.025 M Na2SO4. The pH value of both of the electrolyte solutions is adjusted to 3 by applying concentrated H2SO4. Furthermore, H2O2 (50%) is added to the prepared synthetic wastewater to disburse 0.5 M H2O2 for the generation of Fenton reagent, accordingly."
4,Experimental setup,"2.3 Experimental setup Electrolyte; RB5, sugar (sucrose) and water are treated by using photo-assisted electro-Fenton process (PAEF) to generate hydrogen gas in a two electrode PEC reactor. The solar simulator (irradiance of 600 W/m2) illuminates the reactor to increase hydrogen production efficiency and produce Fe2+/Fe3+ couples from photo-anode. A potentiostat is utilized to monitor, investigate and conduct electric charge required for hydrogen production and anode iron oxidization. The PEC reactor is used for in situ production of hydrogen and Fenton reagent is presented in Fig. 1 . The PEC reactor is located under the solar simulator to illuminate the area of the anode with a surface area of 180 cm2. The working and working sense wires of the potentiostat formed working electrode, which is connected to the graphite rod (cathode), while the counter and counter sense formed the counter electrode which is connected to the TiO2 deposited stainless steel (photoanode). The cathode is placed into a glass chamber to collect the yielded hydrogen. After the characterization of the photoanode is evaluated, the sacrificial iron rate of a stainless steel electrode is measured by a spectrophotometric method to ensure the iron concentration is sufficient for Fenton like process. An electric current of 500 mA is applied at a constant current in galvanostatic mode to the small-scale reactor with a stainless steel electrode under UV light. Potassium hydrogen phthalate solution (KHP) solution is used as the electrolyte. KHP solution is prepared by mainly following the methods of Standard Methods Committee [20], the concentration of the KHP is set twice as the standard COD solution."
5,Analysis methods,"2.4 Analysis methods In order to determine the amount of organic pollutant in the wastewater the COD concentration is monitored. The COD value indicates the amount of oxygen, which is needed for the oxidation of all organic substances in water. In this study, titrimetric open reflux is selected since it is considered as a suitable method for a wide variety of wastes in which a large sample size desired. Standard Methods Committee‘s experimental procedure [20] is followed in experiments. The method is based on the principle of oxidization of the organics by a hot chromic and sulfuric acids. While the decolorization of the sample is measured through the absorbance values within the range of 340 nm to 900 nm a UV-spectrometer is used for monitoring the optical absorbance of the samples."
6,Analysis and assessment,"The analysis part of the study is conducted in two sections, hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. First, hydrogen production rates are tested under solar simulator light with different wastewaters and conversion efficiencies are calculated for several conditions. Then the decolorization and organic compound degradation are measured by time. For a system with water as a substrate, the photocatalytic process starts as the photons hits to the photocatalytic surface and be absorbed due to electron-hole pairs [21]. (1) T i O 2 + h v → e - + h + The vast amount of the reducing power of formed electrons in the reaction in Eq. (1) allows to reduce some metals and dissolved O2 in superoxide radical ion form. The remaining holes are able to oxidize adsorbed water or hydroxide to reactive hydroxyl radicals as follows [21]: (2) TiO 2 h + + H 2 O ad → TiO 2 + HO ad · + H + (3) TiO 2 h + + HO ad - → TiO 2 + HO ad · Part of the adsorbed compound can be oxidized directly via electron migration as follows [21]: (4) TiO 2 h + + RX ad → TiO 2 + RO ad · + Hydroxyl radicals can also be produced via Fenton process. The Fenton oxidation process can be explained as oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and reduction of H2O2 to OH− and HO . (5) Fe aq 2 + + H 2 O 2 → Fe aq 3 + + HO · + OH - Fe3+ which is produced in the conventional Fenton reaction can be reduced to Fe2+ slower than the first reaction by a second molecule of hydrogen peroxide: (6) Fe aq 3 + + H 2 O 2 + H 2 O → Fe aq 2 + + H 3 O + + HO 2 · - In order to catalyze the Fenton reaction, any process which enhances the conversion rate of Fe3+ back to Fe2+ can assist this reaction. In the electro-Fenton reaction, this is attained electrochemically. Moreover, this process can be accelerated either with photonic energy or chemical catalyzers. While organic molecules such as benzoquinones or dihydroxybenzene (DHB) derivatives are used as catalysts in Fenton reactions, ultraviolet light is used for photo-Fenton processes [22]. Nogueira et al. [23] observed synergistic effects between iron oxide (FeOx) and TiO2 and between H2O2 and TiO2 in the degradation of dichloroacetic acid (C2H2Cl2O2). The UV/V light shows a strong accelerator profile for the rate of pollutant degradation in Fenton reaction systems. This behavior can be explained by the photochemical reduction of ferrous iron (Fe3+) back to ferric ions (Fe2+). The reduction reaction can be shown as follows [22]: (7) Fe aq 3 + + H 2 O → hv Fe aq 2 + + HO · + H + Meric et al. [24] have been studied oxidation of RB5 by Fenton process for decolorization and COD degradation from textile wastewater. The optimum pH was observed as 3 for the Fenton reaction. During the Fenton process, ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2+) ions are also produced and with the presence of photonic energy they can be used for the production of Fe2+ and the hydroxyl radical [22]: (8) Fe OH 2 + → hv Fe 2 + + HO · Hence, photo-assisted Fenton reaction is not only reproducing ferrous ions which is the essential catalytic species in the Fenton process but also generates extra hydroxyl radical for the contaminant degradation. Consequently, by means of irradiation Fenton process is accelerated compared to the conventional Fenton reaction. Furthermore, as the ferrous ions are reproduced by irradiation with water splitting rather than H2O2, it results in less consumption in H2O2. Only catalytic amounts of ferrous ions are required. Moreover, no additional pollutants are produced after this process. The photo-Fenton process requires only a small amount of iron salt and if required the remaining ferric ions can be precipitated as Fe(OH)2. Any residual H2O2 at the end of the process will inherently decompose into H2O and O2 which is considered as a “clean” reagent in itself. All the aforementioned features make homogenous photo-assisted Fenton process being considered as a clean, environmentally benign and cost-effective treatment method for small to moderate scale industrial wastes [22]. Fig. 2 shows the hydroxyl radical formation pathways in the PEC reactor. Besides the reactions above, in this study, a portion of the iron ions are in ferric (Fe3+) form and they also react with hydrogen peroxide and produces hydroxyl radicals after Fenton-like process [16]. The amount of gas production by an electrochemical process is associated with the electrical charge consumed by the cell, which is defined by Faraday’s law. (10) N = 1 n F q (11) m ̇ = N × M t where N, q and F represent the moles of the produced hydrogen, electrical charge (A s) and Faraday constant (96485 A s/mol) respectively. As for m ̇ , M and t they represent the gas production rate (g/s), molar mass of the gas (g/mol) and total operation time of the reactor (s) respectively. As the second part of the study, the change in the COD and color of the effluent wastewaters are determined. The COD degradation is obtained via titrimetric open reflux method. While the decolorization of the sample is measured through the absorbance values within the range of 340 nm to 900 nm. UV-spectrometer is used for monitoring the optical absorbance of the samples. The concentration of the residual RB5 solution prepared at pH of 3 is calculated according to Beer-Lambert law with given formula below: (12) A = C ε I Here A shows the absorbance value, C is the concentration of RB5 solution (M), ε is the extinction coefficient (M−1.cm−1) and I is the length of the pathway (cm). Since the concentration and absorbance values are measured and the light pathway is arranged as 1 cm the extinction coefficient of RB5 solution is calculated from the given formula above at the maximum wavelength (λmax = 595 nm). By considering all the inputs and outputs of the system, energy and exergy efficiencies of the PEC reactor can be defined as (13) η e n = m ̇ H 2 L H V H 2 I r A + W ̇ P E C i n (14) η e x = m ̇ H 2 e x H 2 I r A 1 - T 0 T s i m + W ̇ P E C i n Here L H V H 2 , Ir, A represent the lower heating value of hydrogen (kJ/kg), solar irradiance (W/m2) illuminated area (cm2) of the anode respectively and e x H 2 , W ̇ P E C i n , T0, and Ts represent specific exergy of produced hydrogen (kJ/kg), work input to the reactor (kW), ambient and solar simulator temperature (K), respectively."
7,Results and discussion,"The TiO2 coated photoanode plate with a surface area of 180 cm2 is tested for PEC characterization in a solution of 0.05 M of NaOH under solar simulator with measured irradiance of 600 W/m2. A graphite counter electrode was deployed in a full cell setup. The solar simulator light is shut off to obtain the no-light conditions and the experiments are repeated in sequence to avoid any external effect. At the beginning of the experiments, the open circuit potential of the PEC reactor is measured before any electrochemical technique to obtain information about the nature of the coated TiO2 nanoparticles photo anode /electrolyte interface, prior to then subjecting the electrode to a specific electrochemical reaction. Fig. 3 shows the open circuit potential results of the PEC reactor. The negative stable voltage of −0.08 V indicates that there is no spontaneous chemical reaction resulting in positive Gibbs free energy. The TiO2 coated electrode is subjected to a positive overpotential, it is now polarized anodically. Under such conditions, the photo assisted electrode may have significant current flowing through the working electrode and counter electrode. The magnitude of the current is variable over time. As soon as the electrode is subjected to a constant voltage of 2 V as presented in Fig. 4 the reactant at the electrode surface starts to react. The potential on the electrode jumps from OCP to a more anodic potential due to activation polarization as shown in Fig. 4. To enhance the hydrogen production, light conditions increase the activation process and thus resulting in current fluctuations of 300 mA. Fig. 5 shows a potentiostatic of 0.8 V applied voltage with the total current as a function of time for the coated stainless-steel anode under no-light and light conditions. The average current is 22.36 mA and 20.71 mA for the light and no light conditions, respectively. Hence, this indicates an average photocurrent of approximately 1.65 mA. The hydrogen evolution is measured via Faraday‘s law and displaced volume during the testing time of 40 min and repeated several times for validity. Fig. 6 represents the total iron concentration by the sacrificial of the steel anode shows a linear profile by time. At the end of 40 min of operation of the small scale reactor with a 200 ml of KHP solution, iron concentration is increased from 0 ppm to 16.5 ppm. Fig. 7 shows current vs time graph and hydrogen production rate for different types of synthetic wastewater (RB5, sugar) and water by using PAEF with an average input power of 2 W. It can be seen in Fig. 7 that the sucrose has the highest hydrogen production rate of 2.1 ml/min while tap water has the lowest hydrogen production rate of 0.7 ml/min. Also, the highest current flow occurs under water by around 230 mA and the lowest electric current is measured in the experiment uses sucrose solution as the electrolyte. In the open literature Thagard et al. [25] explored hydrogen production from sugar and compared it to tap water. The results showed that the hydrogen production rate from sugar is four times higher than tap water and in agreement with the results presented in Fig. 7. Also Iervolino et al. [26] performed similar study of this work using platinized TiO2 catalysts and the hydrogen 590 μmol/h g after 3 h of irradiation time at pH 2. Hence sugar has high potential for hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical methods. In energy and exergy analyses of the designed hybrid reactor, values of mass flow rate of the produced H2 gas (kg/s), operating pressure (kPa) and temperature (˚C), electric work input to the PEC reactor (W), energy and exergy input rates of the solar simulator (W) and energy and exergy output rates (W) of the PEC reactor are determined and listed in Table 1 . Fig. 8 shows the decolorization of RB5 for treated and untreated samples for a solution (20 l) containing 6 × 10−5 M RB5 (55 ppm of initial COD) at the beginning of the process and the extinction coefficient for RB5 solution is calculated as 28,333. It is observed that the absorption bands decrease with time and the reaction goes on with the formed iron ions and added hydrogen peroxide. After the first day, the sample turns all transparent and no visible change in absorbance is observed. Fig. 8 also shows the untreated and treated sample pictures. Fig. 9 depicts the comparison of color degradation of the RB5 solution just after the experiment. It is observed that, between the wavelengths (λ) of 340 nm and 740 nm, the optical absorbance of the sample decreases considerably. In the scope of this study, 33% of COD reduction is achieved in the first 17 h for the RB5 solution. Total iron ion concentration is also measured immediately after the experiment to observe the sacrificial iron rate from the anode. 0.5 ppm of iron ion is detected in the sample at the end of the experiment. Energy and exergy efficiencies are obtained for the PEC system using RB5 solution, sucrose solution and water the substrate. The average energy and exergy efficiencies are found to be 2.1% and 4.5% respectively. As the solar energy to the system is dominating the energy input, the efficiencies are limited by the conversion efficiency of the titanium dioxide nanoparticle coated surface and hence the efficiencies are dropped accordingly. However, it should be noted that as it is shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 the system induces photo-currents under irradiance and it leads an increase in the hydrogen production rate. Thus, the system produces more hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals under solar irradiance."
8,Conclusions,"Wastewater generated from commercial and residential entities can greatly impact the quality of life. Thus there is a crucial need to find energy efficient and cost effective ways to improve and conserve water without polluting the environment. Photo electro-Fenton reaction appears to be a desirable option amongst the existing hydrogen production and wastewater treatment systems. This study presents the synergetic effects of TiO2 nanoparticle deposition on a stainless steel electrode on hydrogen production and Fenton-like water treatment under various conditions such as different substrates, with and without light conditions. The reactor performance considerably increases with the presence of light. The main findings of this study are summarized as follows: • The maximum hydrogen yield is observed from sucrose solution with a production rate of 2.1 (ml H2/min) and the minimum hydrogen production rate is obtained for the case with water with a production rate of 0.7 (ml/H2 min). • The optical absorbance decreases sharply in the first 17 h and decolorization is completed in 48 h. • 33% COD degradation is obtained in 17 h. • The hydrogen production rate can be improved around 8% with the presence of solar illumination."
