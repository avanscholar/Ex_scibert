0,Introduction,"In recent years, there is an increasing interesting on using ethanol-gasoline as an alternative fuel [1,2]. As a fuel for spark-ignition engines, ethanol has some advantages over gasoline, such as better anti-knock characteristics and the reduction of CO and UHC emissions [3,4]. Ethyl acetate (EA) is widely used both as versatile solvent and as raw materials for organic synthesis. A very promising alternative to the established processes is the single stage hydrogenation of ethyl acetate since ethyl acetate can be produced at lower cost and on larger scale by new process, such as acetaldehyde condensation or ethylene and acid addition now. Processes which include the hydrogenation of ethyl acetate have been proposed for the manufacture of basic chemicals such as ethanol. Furthermore, there has been continuous interest over the past decades in replacing the existing, energy-intensive processes for the production of ethanol by more cost-effective routes involving ethyl acetate hydrogenation. In 1931, Folkers and Adkins [5] first described the reaction that catalytic hydrogenation of esters to two alcohols (Eq. (1)) (1) RCOOR1+2H2 → RCH2OH+ R1OH where R represents an alkyl group and R1 represents another alkyl group or hydrogen. Copper containing catalysts are suitable for hydrogenation of esters to alcohols, because they allow for selective hydrogenation of CO and are relatively inactive in CC bond hydrogenation. Traditional catalysts used are almost comprised of copper and chromium oxides [6–8]. However, the use of chromium poses environmental problems since process water containing high-valence chrome (Cr5+, Cr6+) is generated during catalysts manufacture and regeneration. Research is therefore focused on the development of chromium-free catalysts for the hydrogenation of esters [9–11]. Claus et al. [12] showed that copper and supported Group VIII metal catalysts exhibited activities comparable to copper chromite. Zn and Co additives to skeletal copper catalysts have been studied exhibiting a profound increase in the rate of methanol synthesis, as well as methyl acetate hydrogenation [13–15]. However, these catalysts are expensive and are susceptible to deactivation. Most of the studies have been carried out at reaction conditions with high pressure and some reported catalysts were tested in stirred tank reactor. For example, Chen et al. [16] studied the liquid-phase hydrogenation of methyl acetate over a Boron-promoted copper catalyst at 11–15MPa pressure and temperatures between 473 and 523K in a magnetically stirred autoclave. Studies of Cu/Zn/Al catalysts in ethanol dehydrogenative process to ethyl acetate have been focused on in recent years [17–19] while ethanol is first dehydrogenated to acetaldehyde and then reacts with another ethanol or ethoxide species to form a hemiacetal, which is then dehydrogenated to ethyl acetate. However, few open literatures have focused on the study of ethyl acetate hydrogenation to ethanol (Eq. (2)) using Cu/Zn catalysts. In literatures studied on hydrogenation of aliphatic esters, the conversion of ethyl acetate was 80% while ethanol selectivity was 40% [12,20]. (2) CH3COOC2H5 +2H2 →2C2H5OH Herein we report Cu/Zn–Al2O3 catalyst for hydrogenation of ethyl acetate using continuous fixed-bed reactor under mild reaction conditions. The main aim of this article is to determine the influence of promoter Zn in aluminum supported copper catalysts. Over the most active catalyst, a systematic study of the reaction system, including the influence of reaction temperature and reduction temperature, was carried out. Furthermore, the effects of Zn loading as catalyst supports, the influence of Zn/Al molar ratio and time-on-stream study have been investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The precursors used in this study [21], CuO/ZnO–Al2O3 or CuO/Al2O3 precursors with 9.6wt% Cu loads and different Zn loads (Zn/Al molar ratio=0, 0.05:1, 0.1:1, 0.25:1, 0.5:1) were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation using aluminum oxide as support, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O as precursor (all chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.). The support was prepared via a kneading method using γ-Al2O3, which was sufficiently mixed for 0.5h. Next, a liquid binder, dilute nitric acid, was added to the mixture to make the slurry. An extruder was used to formulate pellets to an outer diameter of 1mm from the slurry. All of the support were dried overnight at 393K in an oven and then calcined in air at 823K for 2h. Such synthesis method was employed since it was demonstrated to produce high dispersed copper crystals [22]. These catalysts are indexed as xCuZnAl, where x identify the Zn/Al molar ratio. Cu and Zn nitrates were dissolved in distilled water and added to the solid support in such quantity to be fully taken up into the pores (incipient wetness). The catalysts were then dried in air at 393K for 2h and maintained at ambient temperature overnight. 573K calcination temperatures for the same time (4h) in air were applied to the catalysts, in order to determine the influence of different Zn/Al molar ratio in EA hydrogenation."
3,Characterization of catalyst,"2.2 Characterization of catalyst 2.2.1 X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was used to characterize the crystal structure. The experiments were performed using a Siemens D500 diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (40kV, 100mA) and equipped with a graphite monochromator with a reflected beam. The powder diffraction patterns were recorded in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. An X-ray chamber-reactor was used for the high-temperature registration of the spectra. Preceding the experiments, 100mg of different Zn/Al molar ratio loading catalysts were calcined in dry air at 573K for 4h. 2.2.2 N2-adsorption Nitrogen isotherms were measured at 77K with an ASAP 2020 (Micromeritrics). Before experiment, the samples were heated at 393K and outgassed overnight at this temperature under a vacuum of 10−5 Torr to a constant pressure. TThe specific surface areas (SBET) of the catalysts were calculated from a multipoint Braunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms 2.2.3 Temperature-programmed reduction Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of H2 was carried out on Auto Chem 2910 (Micromeritics) instrument to study the reducibility of Zn promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalysts. In a typical experiment, 0.05g of calcined catalyst was exposed to a reducing gas consisting of 5.0vol% H2 in argon with a temperature ramp from ambient temperature to 1000K at a heating rate of 10K/min. 2.2.4 Thermo-gravimetric analysis Thermo-gravimetric (TG) curves were obtained using a TA Instruments thermal analyzer. The samples were subjected to increased temperature, up to 973K, at a rate of 10K/min, while the nitrogen flow rate was held constant at 100cm3/min. 2.2.5 TEM TEM images of reduced catalysts were recorded using an accelerating voltage of 200kV (JEOL-2010F) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) facility. Before TEM analysis, catalysts were reduced in a stream of H2 at 573K for 1h, the reduced powders were poured into alcohol under the protection of H2 and suspended with an ultrasonic dispersion for 15min, and then the resulted solution was dropped on carbon film of nickel grid."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The reaction was performed in a fixed-bed reactor (Fig. 1 .) operated in the down flow mode at a pressure of 2MPa. The reaction temperature was measured with a thermocouple that was in contact with the catalyst bed. The organic-feed consisted of EA (100%) and was fed into the reactor using a micro-syringe pump. For each experiment, 1.35g of unreduced catalyst (20–40 mesh) was loaded into the flow reactor. The catalyst was reduced in situ at atmospheric pressure with H2 (flow rate of 30cm3/min) in 573K for 2h. The products were analyzed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (flame ionization detector, HP-5 column, 30m×5mm×0.25μm) and confirmed by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS). EA conversion (X EA), selectivity to ethanol product (S ethanol) and yield of ethanol (Y ethanol) were calculated according to (Eqs. (3–5)), (3) X EA % = M ( EA in ) − M ( EA out ) M ( EA in ) × 100 (4) S ethanol ( % ) = M ( Product ethanol,out ) 2 × ( M ( EA in ) − M ( EA out ) ) × 100 (5) Y ethanol ( % ) = X EA ( % ) × S ethanol ( % ) 100 where M(EAin), M(EAout) and M(Productethanol,out) represent the concentration of reactant or ethanol product entering (in) or leaving (out) the reactor."
5,Results and discussion,
6,XRD and N2-adsorption,"3.1 XRD and N2-adsorption X-ray diffraction was employed to identify crystalline phases and to determine the crystallite size of supported particles. As shown in Fig. 2 , sharp and symmetrical reflections at 13.6°, 45.9° and 66.9° were detected in all samples, which are ascribed to diffraction of alumina support. Profiles of calcined 0.25CuZnAl and 0.5CuZnAl samples examined at the big angle showed the characteristic peaks for CuO species at 2θ =35.2°, 37.6° [23,24]. For 0.5CuZnAl sample, the peaks at 2θ =12.8°, 25.8° and 32.6° assigned to Zn3(OH)4(NO3)2 (ICDD No. 70-1361) [25] appeared before reduction treatment with increasing zinc oxide contents. The intensity of characteristic reflection peaks of CuO increased with the amount of added Zn. The crystallite size was calculated using Scherrer's equation: D =0.9λ/(β cos θ), where A is the X-ray wavelength (0.154nm) and β is the line broadening. The diameters of CuO crystals of 0CuZnAl, 0.25CuZnAl and 0.5CuZnAl were calculated as 12nm, 16nm and 22nm [26,27] which may mean that the orderliness of CuO crystallite increased at high Zn loading. These suggest that Cu catalysts with high Zn/Al molar ratio kept the representative crystal structure. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of 0CuZnAl, 0.25CuZnAl, and 0.5CuZnAl catalysts reduced at different reduction temperatures. It can be found in 0.25CuZnAl catalyst that the diffraction lines of CuO and Zn3(OH)4(NO3)2 disappeared after hydrogen reduction while separated Cu at 43.7° and Al2ZnO4 were detected, meanwhile, Cu and Al2O3 peaks can also be found in 0CuZnAl catalyst. The peaks assigned to Cu appeared and Al2ZnO4 peaks became intense with the increasing reduction temperature. The diameters of Cu crystals of reduced 0.25CuZnAl at 473K, 523K, 573K, 673K and 773K were 10nm, 11nm, 12nm, 14nm and 19nm. Therefore, Cu species were visible when reduction temperature was increasing, which clearly shows that the concentration of Cu increased with the increasing reduction temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3, 0CuZnAl, 0.05CuZnAl, 0.1CuZnAl and 0.5CuZnAl samples reduced at 573K also had obvious Cu peak while it was not obvious in 0.25CuZnAl. The diameters of Cu crystals of reduced 0CuZnAl, 0.05CuZnAl, 0.1CuZnAl, 0.25CuZnAl and 0.5CuZnAl at 573K were calculated as 18nm, 10nm, 19nm, 11nm and 21nm. The dramatic increase in peak intensity may reflect the growth in crystal size and induce of active phase dispersion. It has been reported by van der Grift et al. [28,29]. The BET surface area of the prepared Al2O3 support was measured to be 101.5m2/g, while the 0CuZnAl, 0.1CuZnAl, 0.25CuZnAl, and 0.5CuZnAl catalysts increased to 110.7m2/g, 120.3m2/g, 132.6m2/g and 137.1m2/g. Compared with non-impregnated support, catalysts that added Cu and Zn showed larger specific surface area. With the increasing of Zn content, remarkable increase of BET surface area could be observed, however, too much Zn content only slightly changed the surface areas."
7,Temperature-programmed reduction,"3.2 Temperature-programmed reduction The TPR profiles of the samples are presented in Fig. 4 . The peaks with Temperature at 463K (0CuZnAl) and 479K (0.25CuZnAl) can be attributed to the reduction of Cu2+ particles that have no interaction with the support. The reduction of 0.25CuZnAl catalyst with long tail (within 550 and 900K) is characteristic for the Zn species on the solid surface [30,31]. XRD patterns in Fig. 3 showed no metallic zinc occurred in catalyst which is conformed to TPR result. The ratio between the amount of hydrogen consumed and the amount of reducible species (Cu2+) was determined quantitatively. It was found that the calculated H2/Cu molar ratio increased from 1.05 (of 0CuZnAl) to 1.25 (of 0.25CuZnAl). The result could be attributed to that more active hydrogen would spill over to the surface of dispersed Cu with the existence of Al2ZnO4. That is, part amount of dissociated hydrogen would store on the surface of Cu and support material. During the reduction at high temperature where the species are mobile, the species with the lowest surface energy will segregate to the surface. Since surface energy is lower than CuO [32,33], some Zn2+ may segregate to the surface and spread over support which made CuO reduction a little difficult (The reduction peak of Cu2+ appeared at a temperature 16K higher than the catalyst without Zn), which indicated that a good copper-support contact exists before reduction and CuO species in 0.25CuZnAl are more stable. Zn additives on Cu catalysts showed good copper-promoter contact which may attribute promoter effects to increase dispersion of the copper phase [34]."
8,TGA,"3.3 TGA Fig. 5 shows the TG profiles of as synthesized 0CuZnAl and 0.25CuZnAl and weight loss peaks were marked by dash lines. TG profile of Fig. 5(a) indicates three major weight losses of 0CuZnAl at around 323–453K, 453–523K and 523–723K which can be identified as the losses of adsorbed surface water bound to gallery or external surfaces, H-bound water in interlayer and the weight losses of Cu(NO3)2 to CuO. The overall weight loss of 0CuZnAl from 523K to 723K is 15.5% which was conformed with the Cu(NO3)2 to CuO while the calculated weight loss is 16%. Profile of Fig. 5(b) indicates four major weight losses at around 323–453K, 453–523K, 523–603K and 603–723K. The overall weight loss of 0CuZnAl and 0.25CuZnAl from 523K to 723K is 25%, which was conformed with the formula of as-synthesize Cu(NO3)2·Zn3(OH)4(NO3)2 to CuO·ZnO. Weight loss in temperature from 523–603K and 603–723K can be of Cu(NO3)2 to CuO and Zn(OH)4(NO3)2 to ZnO [35]. Based on the above analysis, when the calcination temperature is 573K, no ZnO will be found in the catalyst of 0.25CuZnAl which is well conformed to the XRD analysis (see Fig. 2)."
9,TEM analysis,"3.4 TEM analysis Fig. 6 shows TEM images of reduced 0CuZnAl and 0.25CuZnAl. The highly dispersion state of Cu in the reduced catalysts were also confirmed by TEM analysis. No separated Cu particle can be identified, which inferred that copper dispersed homogenously in the 0.25CuZnAl samples. EDX analysis of these samples (denoted in the dashed circle) confirmed that the surface compositions of these catalysts are similar as their bulk content. On the other hand, a lot of separated copper particles sized in 6–10nm were detected in typical TEM image of reduced 0CuZnAl. The formation of separated of Cu particles in 0CuZnAl could be attributed to that the crystalline structure of calcined 0CuZnAl is poor and the surface area of reduced catalyst is low."
10,Effect of Zn content,"3.5 Effect of Zn content It was observed that the conversion of EA changed with the increasing Zn/Al molar ratio as well as reaction time (Table 1 ). The conversion of EA was 31.1% when without Zn loading and it increased to 66.3% when the Zn/Al molar ratio increased to 0.25, which implies that the added Zn in Cu based catalysts affects the activity of surface Cu, known as a catalytically active site for EA hydrogenation [20,36]. However, the conversion decreased a little when the ratio was higher than 0.25. The selectivity of ethanol had no obvious change with the increasing Zn/Al molar ratio. The yield of ethanol (Fig. 7 ) can indicate the activity of catalysts. As mentioned early, Cu is the active species in the hydrogenation reaction, and samples with Zn as support would be more active than samples without Zn content. With the increasing Zn loading, the conversion increased because of the catalytic activity increasing. However, exorbitant Zn loading may lead to decrease in conversion as crystal structure of CuO forming which influenced the dispersion of CuO. XRD results (Fig. 3) clearly show that the relative dispersion of Cu changed with different ZnO loadings. Therefore, it is obvious that the Cu/Zn ratio plays a crucial role in the activity of Cu–Zn/Al catalyst in the EA hydrogenation reaction, even though surface Cu is the active site."
11,Effect of calcination temperature on the 0.25CuZnAl catalyst,"3.6 Effect of calcination temperature on the 0.25CuZnAl catalyst Different calcination temperatures ranging from 523K to 723K were tested on 0.25CuZnAl. Under the different calcination temperatures, the EA hydrogenation activities were collected, as shown in Fig. 8 . It reveals that the optimal calcination temperature of the 0.25CuZnAl catalyst was 573K. As the calcination temperature increased from 573K to 723K, the EA conversion was gradually reduced while the selectivity to ethanol had no obvious change. As shown in XRD result, Cu in reduced 0.25CuZnAl catalyst which was calcined at 573K was well-dispersed, stable and had small particle size. These results indicated that the conversion of EA depends strongly on the particle size of copper, smaller sized copper is extremely active. The same to TGA result, Cu in 0.25CuZnAl catalyst which was calcined at 573K was well-reduced. These results indicated that the conversion of EA depends strongly on the calcination temperature."
12,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.7 Effect of reaction temperature Obviously, the reaction temperature plays an important role in ester hydrogenation. Reactions were carried out at 503–563K (Fig. 9 ). Temperature was critical in obtaining the desired ethanol yield or selectivity. The conversion of EA increased from 57.7% to 66.3% upon increasing the reaction temperature from 503K to 523K and decreased to 34.4% when reaction temperature reached 563K. The hydrogenation of ethyl acetate [37] was complicated by the subsequent formation of acetaldehyde. The reaction was found to be in equilibrium under the given reaction (Eq. (6)), (6) C2H5OH↔CH3CHO+H2 which had been discovered over silica-supported copper at temperatures near 570K. However, it is reported that [36] under conditions that the reaction temperature is lower than 950K, ethanol was the dominant product with some acetaldehyde and small amounts of CH4 and CO being produced at high conversions. It is well-known that EA hydrogenation is an exothermic reaction (ΔH <0). According to Le Chatelier's principle, every system in stable chemical equilibrium submitted to the influence of an exterior force which tends to cause variation either in its temperature, in its totality or only in some of its parts, can undergo only those interior modifications change of temperature of a sign contrary to that resulting from the exterior force, which indicating that with the reaction temperature rose, thermodynamic equilibrium constant decreases which is benefit to reverse process, and it is not conducive to the generation of ethanol which was were well conformed to experiment result. Meanwhile, lower amounts of adsorbed reactants that have been found in other similar systems [38,39] may relate to chemical equilibrium since adsorption is also an exothermic phenomenon. From kinetic point of view, EA hydrogenation usually needs high activation energy (EA=88kJ/mol). The reaction temperature is typically higher than 450K. The increasing reaction temperature can increase the reaction rate, which is conducive to the EA hydrogenation. However, high reaction temperature which is higher than 600K may be further connected in series side effects reducing the ethanol selectivity, so the reaction temperature should be controlled in a reasonable range. It is apparent from the results that the EA conversion and the desired product selectivity can be obtained by controlling the change of temperature while the optimum temperature is 523K."
13,Effect of reduction temperature,"3.8 Effect of reduction temperature The catalysts were reduced for 2h in H2 flow at temperatures in the range from 423 to 773K. The effect of reduction temperature on the conversion of EA is shown in Fig. 10 . The conversion of EA increased from 57.6% to 66.3% upon the increasing reduction temperature from 423K to 573K, while it decreased to 28.8% when the temperature was 773K. As shown in XRD result (Fig. 3), increasing in reduction temperature lead to an increase of metallic particle size which meant that the reaction needed the appropriate metallic particle size of Cu. As shown in TPR, CuO was reduced within 450 and 490K, while ZnO reduced higher than 550K. It is apparent from the result that on the condition when CuO was completely reduced while ZnO keeping original formation was benefit to high EA hydrogenation conversion."
14,Time-on-stream study,"3.9 Time-on-stream study Fig. 11 shows the stability of Cu/Zn–Al2O3 catalysts for EA hydrogenation. On first 12h, the products were analyzed every 0.5h and the conversion of EA increased firstly to 65.5% at 4h. After that we increased the sampling interval time to 1h and 2h, and then the conversion of EA remained 71.5% almost constant during the 80h on stream. It is apparent that the selectivity to ethanol was stable during 90h."
15,Conclusions,"In summary, a highly active catalyst containing Cu, Zn and Al was synthesized for hydrogenation of ethyl acetate in this work, which was proved to be feasible in producing ethanol. An even stronger effect of catalyst calcination and reduction temperature on EA hydrogenation activity has been found for the zinc containing catalyst in contrast with results obtained with Zn-free Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. Moreover, the presence of Zn enhanced the catalytic activity of surface Cu which explains the fact that Zn retains a function of chemical promoter. Since both structural and chemical characteristics are profoundly affected, the activity of Cu-containing catalyst on EA hydrogenation can be promoted by addition of Zn as well as the optimization of Zn/Al ratio. In a word, this bimetallic catalyst is efficient and attractive for EA hydrogenation to ethanol."
