0,Introduction,"The catalytic steam reforming of various hydrocarbons, such as methane [1], LPG [2], butane [3], Naphtha [4], dimethylether [5], acetic acid [6], and light alcohols (ethanol and methanol) [7,8], to produce hydrogen is of significant industrial importance and is of increasing interest in the context of a hydrogen economy. Methanol as a hydrogen carrier has received particular attention due to its advantages of high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, molecular simplicity, lack of any CC bond, and relatively low reforming temperatures due to its low energy chemical bond. Hydrogen can be obtained directly from methanol according to three different processes: thermal decomposition (TD) [9], partial oxidation of methanol (POM) [10], and methanol steam reforming (MSR) [11], according to the following equations: (1) CH3OH+H2O→3H2 +CO2 ΔH 298°=49.4kJmol−1 (2) CH3OH+1/2O2 →2H2 +CO2 ΔH 298°=−192.2kJmol−1 (3) CH3OH→2H2 +COΔH 298°=22.4kJmol−1 Most fuel-processing technologies reported in the literature so far have been based on either MSR or POM; both produce almost quantitatively H2 and CO2. While POM is exothermic, MSR is endothermic and produces a more favorable H2/CO2 ratio. Another option is the combined reaction and simultaneous co-feeding of oxygen, steam and methanol through the oxidative MSR. In this process, the heat necessary to maintain MSR is supplied by POM by tuning the ratio of the three reactants such that the overall reaction heat is nearly neutral. Generally, hydrogen production by MSR has been successfully demonstrated and a large variety of catalysts has been reported to be active for MSR. The majority of these catalysts have been copper-based. It is believed that the active sites in Cu-containing catalysts are metallic Cu species [12]. Commercial copper-containing, water–gas shift and methanol synthesis catalysts have also been found to be active for MSR, such as Cu/ZnO and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts [13,14]. Shishido et al. [15] also attributed the high activity of these catalysts to highly disperse Cu metal particles with high accessibility to methanol and steam. The effect of promoters on the activity of alumina and/or ZnO catalysts was thoroughly investigated for applications in low temperature fuel cells. However, the well known Cu-impregnated catalysts have a serious limitation; they rapidly deactivate resulting from the weakening of the isolated Cu components against water molecules. To improve the catalytic deactivation on Cu-based catalysts, Hong and Ren [16] also investigated the Cu effect on the selective hydrogen production from oxidative MSR over Zn–Cr catalysts. In their results, a Zn–Cr–Cu oxide solid solution was formed by adding a small amount of Cu to the ZnCr catalyst, which significantly improved the activity and suppressed the CO formation. In another example, Au/Al2O3 catalyst modified by copper oxide exhibited high catalytic activity in CO oxidation [17,18]. Chang et al. reported [19] the production of hydrogen via POM over bimetallic Au–Cu/TiO2 catalysts. The bimetallic Au–Cu/TiO2 catalysts were more active and stable and exhibited higher hydrogen selectively with a smaller amount of CO compared to the monometallic Au/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 catalysts. Several studies demonstrated that the activity and stability of the gold catalyst increased if it was supported on, or promoted by, transition-metal oxides [20–22]. The addition of Cu or copper oxide to Au catalyst was studied for several other reactions, including water gas shift, total oxidation of methane, ethane and propane and epoxidation of propene [23–25]. In composite catalysts, the two different materials complement each other in electronic properties, oxygen mobility and surface stability. However, the Cu-based catalysts suffer some limitations due to the weakening of isolated Cu components against water molecules, which can lead to abrupt catalytic deactivation [26]. We assumed that the lower Brønsted acidity led to the weak thermal cracking of hydrocarbons over the Cu-based catalysts, and thus reduced the hydrogen evolution. Therefore, to determine the effect of enhancing Brønsted acid sites, we tried to introduce phosphate ions onto the Cu–Ti-based catalyst, so that the PO4 3− terminal groups attract the H+ ions which are expressed at the Brønsted acid sites. Therefore, the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts, with Cu (1.0mol%) and P (1.0, 2.0, and 4.0mol%) incorporated into the framework of Ti(1.0mol%)O2 with a thin sheet shape, were synthesized using a solvothermal method and used with a γ-Al2O3 support and investigated for their potential compatibility in oxidative MSR. The catalytic physicochemical properties were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The optimum operational temperature of the catalysts was identified by a parametric study in MSR activity over Cu–Ti–P oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The methanol steam reforming reactions were conducted over a temperature range of 200–600°C at 50°C intervals. The effects of temperature, steam-to-methanol ratio, and residence time on the activity and selectivity of the catalysts were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts To 150ml of ethanol (Aldrich, absolute 99.99%) solvent was added 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0mol of phosphoric acid (H3PO4, Aldrich, 85wt.% in H2O), after which 1.0mol of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, Aldrich, 99.99%) was dropped into the solution and then 1.0mol of copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2, Aldrich, 99.99%) was added step by step. The slurry was stirred homogeneously and transferred into an autoclave. The final solution was thermally treated at 200°C for 8h in nitrogen environment. After thermal reaction, the attained Cu–Ti–P powders were washed repeatedly until the pH was stabilized at 7 and then dried at 100°C for 24h in air condition. Finally, three samples, Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(1), Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2), and Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(4), were calcined at 500°C for 2h in N2 condition to stabilize the skeleton. For MSR, the Cu–Ti–P oxide powders were loaded onto the surface of the γ-Al2O3 support by incipient wetness impregnation to a level of 30.0wt.%. After impregnation, the final Cu–Ti–P oxide/γ-Al2O3 samples were thermally treated in air condition at 500°C for 2h. All samples were thermally treated in H2/argon (1:10 ratio) condition at 300°C for 2h before MSR."
3,Characterizations of the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts,"2.2 Characterizations of the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts The three prepared Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts were identified through powder XRD analysis (MPD model, PANalytical, Yeungnam University Instrumental Analysis Center, Korea) with nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (30kV, 30mA) at 2-theta angles of 5–80°. The scan speed was 10°/min and the time constant was 1s. The Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface areas of the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts was measured using a Micrometrics ASAP 2000 instrument. All catalysts were degassed before BET surface measurement. The degassing was carried out under vacuum at 120°C for 1h, after which the samples were thermally treated at 300°C for 30min. The BET surface areas of the catalysts were measured by nitrogen gas adsorption with a mixture of nitrogen and helium as the carrier gas. XPS measurements of Cu2p, Ti2p, P2p, C1s and O1s over the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts were recorded with an AXIS-NOVA (Kratos Inc., at Korea Basic Science Institute) system, equipped with a non-monochromatic AlKα (1486.6eV) X-ray source. The powders were pelletized at 1.2×104 kPa for 1min, and the resulting 1.0-mm pellets were then maintained overnight in a vacuum (1.0×10−7 Pa) to remove water molecules from the surface prior to measurement. The base pressure system was below 1×10−9 Pa. The experiments were recorded with a 200-W source power and an angular acceptance of ±5°. The analyzer axis made an angle of 90° with the specimen surface. A Shirley function was used to subtract the background in the XPS data analysis. The signals were fitted using mixed Lorentzian–Gaussian curves. The amount and activation energies for methanol adsorption–desorption on the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts were determined using a thermal gravimeter (TG), equipped with a micro thermo-differential and gravimetric analyzer (SDT Q600, TA instruments, Yeungnam University Instrumental Analysis Center, Korea). To maintain identical methanol conditions, the samples were analyzed after being brought into contact with saturated methanol for 24h. Twenty milligrams of α-alumina was used as the reference sample. The methanol desorption was done in deferent heating rates. Ozawa presented a useful equation for the calculation of the activation energy of various thermal reactions, based on the shifts in the maximum (or minimum) deflection temperature (T m ) of the DTG curves on changing the heating rate [27] as follows: log ϕ + 0.4567 E R T m = constant Here, ϕ is the heating rate, E the activation energy and R the gas constant. The activation energy can be derived from the slope, 0.4567E/R, of a plot of log vs. 1/T m . The structure and Brønsted acid sites caused by the OH group over the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts after pyridine adsorption were measured by FT-IR experiments. The FT-IR spectra (IR Prestige-21, Shimazue Co., Japan) were recorded on a Mattson 1000 spectrometer using the diffused reflectance method. The powdered sample, mixed with CaF2, was pressed into pellet form. The pellet was kept at 200°C in a dry oven for 2h before the measurement to reduce the influence of moisture in the air. The scan range for the measurements ranged from 400 to 3600cm−1, with 50 scans accumulated to obtain a resolution of 4.0cm−1. For H2-TPR of Cu–Ti–P oxide, 0.3g of catalysts was pre-treated under helium flow (30ml/min) at 300°C for 2h, and then cooled to room temperature. Analysis was carried out by flowing 30ml/min of H2 (10vol.%)/N2 and raising the catalyst temperature from room temperature to 500°C at 5°C/min. In order to study the formation of carbon species on the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalyst surface, temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was applied using a SDT Q600 thermo-gravimeter (Yeungnam University Instrumental Analysis Center, Korea) by introducing 5% oxygen in helium into the system after it had been purged with helium. A 20mg sample was placed in a sample pan and heated from 50 to 800°C at a constant heating rate of 10°C/min in 40ml/min air flow. The profiles were obtained in the same manner as described for TPD, and the coke contents were calculated from the weight loss in the temperature range from 200 to 800°C. The α-alumina (20mg) was used as the reference. The CO and CO2 were calibrated by injecting a known amount of the gases from a sample loop into an injection valve in the bypass line."
4,Conditions of methanol steam-reforming (MSR) reaction over the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts,"2.3 Conditions of methanol steam-reforming (MSR) reaction over the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts Fig. 1 shows a reactor for MSR, and the catalytic activities were measured in the temperature range of 200–600°C at 1-h reaction time intervals, and at a steam-to-methanol ratio of 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 (mol%) with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 8418, 10,522, and 15,784h−1, respectively. The catalysts (0.3g; composed of Cu–Ti–P 30wt.%/γ-Al2O3) were pelletized to 20–25 mesh, packed with a small amount of quartz wool to prevent them from moving in the fixed-bed quartz reactor, and mounted vertically inside a furnace. All catalysts were first reduced in situ under hydrogen (10ml/min) for 2h at 300°C prior to each run. A methanol/water solution (mol/mol) was then introduced into a vaporizer. In most studies [28,29], the methanol and water were typically mixed with weight percentage, immediately vaporized at boiling point temperature, and then sent to a reactor. In our study, however, the vaporization temperatures for water and methanol were calculated by partial pressure law. The methanol and water were vaporized at 20°C and 30°C, respectively, in the case of a steam-to-methanol ratio of 1.0:1.0, which was calculated by law of partial pressure and corresponded to 15mol%/carrier gases. The vaporization temperatures were changed according to concentration of methanol and steam. The flow rate was kept at a rate of 25ml/min methanol and 25ml/min steam. Argon gas was used to carry the vaporized mixture to the reactor. The reaction products were measured by on-line gas chromatography on a Donam DS6200 (Donam company, Korea) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionizing detector (FID). The TCD was used for the detection of H2, dimethylether, CH3OH, CO, and CO2, while the FID was used for the detection of CH4 and other hydrocarbon products. The methanol conversion (X MeOH) and the selectivity of the carbon-containing products (SC) of the various samples were calculated according to the following equations, respectively: X MeOH = mol MeOH in − mol MeOH out mol MeOH in × 100 % SC H 2 = mol H 2 ( mol MeOH in − mol MeOH out ) − ( mol H 2 O in − mol H 2 O out ) × 100 % SC others = mol others out mol MeOH in − mol MeOH out × 100 % The influence of GHSV on the catalytic performance was studied in the same reactor system by varying the gas flow rate of the feed. The GHSV cited in this study was calculated based on the total flow rate of the feed mixture in the gas phase."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characteristics of the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts,"3.1 Characteristics of the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts The three Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts (the calcined samples at 500°C) were characterized by XRD and the resulting patterns before and after H2-reduction are shown in Fig. 2(A) and (B). The special peaks of the Cu, Ti, and P components, acting in its role as the core species in the catalysts, were evident at 20.82°, 28.03°, 37.56°, and 25.32°, which assigned to P2O5 [JCPDS870952], Cu4O3 [JCPD330480], TiP [JCPDS731821], and anatase TiO2[JCPDS861157], respectively, in Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide. However, the P2O5 peak was tiny in Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(1) oxide because only a small had been amount, and the peaks were stronger in Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(4) oxide. Dramatically, phosphoric acid was more reactive with Ti ions than with Cu ions, and induced a decrease in the Cu4O3 peaks with increasing phosphoric acid, although the TiP peak was increased. However, these special peaks were largely decreased after hydrogen gas reduction at 500°C for MSR, and reduced forms of the Cu, Ti, and P components were evident. Otherwise, the strongly expressed new peaks were assigned to Cu metals [JCPD851326] by hydrogen reduction at 43.0, 50.5, and 74.1°, and these peaks were slightly decreased at the presence of high phosphoric acid. Fig. 3 shows TEM images of the three Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts (the calcined samples at 500°C) as well as of the catalyst without P component. The Cu–Ti (vs. 400nm) catalyst without the P component and the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(1) oxide (vs. 70nm) catalyst were almost completely irregular types. Interestingly, the morphologies of the catalysts with phosphate were close to that of the sheet type (Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide, vs. 1.5μm), and were then transferred to a non-uniform panel type (vs. 300nm) in Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(4) oxide. This result was attributed to the condensation reaction between hydroxyl groups (OH) in the terminal sites of the three phosphate catalysts. Table 1 summarizes the physical properties of the four catalysts (the calcined samples at 500°C) before loading onto the γ-Al2O3 support. Energy dispersive analysis of the X-rays revealed that the P concentrations were smaller compared to those in the initial solutions of the synthesis steps. From their (Cu, Ti, and P) each composed value we presumed that the P atoms have well linked to the Ti atoms. Regarding the relative concentration of Cu atoms as the core catalytic species, the Cu/Cu+Ti+P ratios were 0.46, 0.39, 0.21, and 0.28 in Cu(1)–Ti(1) oxide, Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(1) oxide, Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide, and Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(4) oxide, respectively, which indicated that the Cu atoms were well dispersed over Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide, and may have lowered the deactivation during MSR. The surface area showed a strong relation to the P amount, and was maximized at 40.77m2/g in Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide, which was attributed to the partial adsorption of the nitrogen molecules to the OH group of phosphate. Fig. 4 compares the interfacial binding energy between three atoms in the four catalysts, based on the FT-IR spectroscopy results of the calcined samples at 500°C and those after pyridine adsorption. Generally, the peak intensities, for the binding of the pyridine molecules adsorbed on the catalysts, are strongly dependent on the acidities of the catalysts [30]. In addition, the acidities of catalysts strongly affect the catalytic performance in MSR reaction. In (A), the IR spectra showed absorptions at 540, 600, and 750cm−1, which were assigned to the metal-oxygen (CuO or TiO) stretching modes [31]. The absorption around 1125cm−1 was assigned to the PO stretching bonds. Importantly, one peak assigned to the OH stretching mode of Brønsted acid sites was evident at 1620cm−1, and was more increased in the three Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts than in the Cu(1)–Ti(1) oxide catalyst without P component. When the pyridine molecules were adsorbed on the catalysts, a new peak, which was assigned to the NPO stretching mode, was sharply generated on the three Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts. Additionally, the OH band remarkably increased on the three Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts, particularly on Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(1) oxide and Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide, but its was not significant on the Cu(1)–Ti(1) oxide catalyst without P component. This suggests that the methanol molecules are largely adsorbed over the three Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts during MSR, and that this induces the high catalytic activity. Table 2 summarizes the activation energy calculated by the Ozawa method, and shows the methanol adsorption – DTG thermogram results for the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst as a representative sample. The DTG curves as a derivative form were attained by varying the heating rate among 5, 10, and 15°C/min, and the maximum points (T m ), corresponding to the endothermic thermal cracking for each catalyst, were recorded. Generally the positions of T m were shifted to higher temperatures with increasing heating rate. The endothermic peaks of 32–57°C, which were assigned to the desorption of methanol adsorbed on the external, were observed in all catalysts. Using the results in the figure, the activation energy was calculated by the Ozawa method. Ozawa has presented a useful equation to calculate the activation energy of various thermal reactions based on the shift of the T m of the DSC thermograms as the heating rate was changed, as mentioned in Section 2. The large activation energy means the greater for methanol-friendly, thereby increasing the methanol absorption and consequently increasing the catalytic activity. From the T m values, the activation energies for the desorption of methanol molecules which were adsorbed on and in the catalysts were calculated to be 8.75, 9.54, 24.44, and 26.23kcal/mol and hence increasing in the order of Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(1) oxide/γ-Al2O3, Cu(1)–Ti(1) oxide/γ-Al2O3, Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(4) oxide/γ-Al2O3, and Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3, respectively. The activation energy was the largest in the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This result suggested that the methanol as a reactant feed gas will be well adsorbed over the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst during MSR, ultimately leading to a good catalytic activity."
7,Methanol steam-reforming (MSR) reaction over the Cu–Ti–P oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalysts,"3.2 Methanol steam-reforming (MSR) reaction over the Cu–Ti–P oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalysts To determine the catalytic performance, the 30wt.% Cu–Ti–P oxide powders were loaded over γ-Al2O3. And all catalysts were reduced by H2 gases before reduction. MSR was carried out with 0.3g each of the four catalysts under the following reaction conditions: time interval of 1h, GHSV=10,522/h and CH3OH:H2O=1.0:1.0. Fig. 5 compares the hydrogen production and methanol conversion corresponding to the reaction temperature over the four catalysts. In figure (B), only methanol conversion is compared, and it reached 100% above 400°C. The high conversion over the Cu(1)–Ti(1) oxide/γ-Al2O3 and Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalysts occurred at a relatively low temperature compared with that over the other two catalysts; however, the conversion was significantly decreased after 350°C over the Cu(1)–Ti(1) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst without P component, differently high conversion was continued to the high temperature over the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. In the most promising result shown in (A), the maximum hydrogen yields were shifted to higher temperature over the three Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts, particularly over Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3, and approached 83% at 450°C. Otherwise, the Cu–Ti oxide catalyst without P component provided 58% at 350°C, but this was significantly lower at higher temperatures. Fig. 6 compares the main product distribution on MSR over the Cu(1)–Ti(1) oxide/γ-Al2O3 and Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalysts at each temperature after 1h with the same reaction conditions in Fig. 5. The methanol conversion reached 100%. Three species were present in the product distribution: H2, CO, and CH4. Significantly, the CO selectivity was the highest at almost above 20% in the Cu(1)–Ti(1) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst without P component, and it increased further at higher temperatures, and reached 53% at 500°C. Otherwise, as expected, the CO selectivity was decreased to below 10% in the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst at higher temperature, but instead the H2 and selectivity were remarkably increased. This result was attributed to the continued acidities of the catalysts at higher temperature, due to the addition of phosphate, with only the lower sintering between metals that enhanced the hydrogen selectivity on methanol conversion. Therefore, our results demonstrated that the additional introduction of acidic sites between the metal oxide catalysts induced a synergistic effect in catalytic performance and increased the catalytic life by decreasing the sintering phenomenon in catalytic deactivation."
8,Characteristics of catalysts after methanol steam reforming (MSR),"3.3 Characteristics of catalysts after methanol steam reforming (MSR) Fig. 7 compares the XRD patterns of the three catalysts after 10h of the MSR reaction at 450°C with that of the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The XRD patterns show no large difference compared with that before except for a decrease in the peak intensity. Cu peaks were seen mainly, and the broad peaks at 33° and 37° which were assigned to the CuO partially appeared after the reaction, and otherwise P2O5 peaks were broad. This indicated that the Cu and P components acted as active sites in the MSR reaction. Generally the Cu species are very weak against water molecules, and can be converted to Cu(OH)2 after reaction [32]. However, the Cu stability was depressed by the P component in this study. Fig. 8 presents the typical survey and high-resolution spectra from the quantitative XPS analysis of the three catalysts before and after reaction for the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The survey spectra contained the Cu2p, Ti2p, P2p, C1s, and O1s peaks. The 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin–orbital photoelectrons of Cu, which were assigned to the oxide components of Cu, were located at the binding energy of 854.5 and 782.9eV, respectively [33], for the before reaction case. In general, a large binding energy indicates more oxidized states [34]. After reaction, the curves were shifted to a lower binding energy, and particularly the intensity was also rather largely increased, which corresponded to the change of oxidation state from Cu° to Cu2P. The same phenomenon occurred for Ti2p: the shift to lower binding energy was the slight and peak intensity was big. These results indicated that the activated core metals, particular Cu, were reacted with P at the lower oxidation states after the MSR, and is the confirmation of their involvement in the oxidation of methanol during the MSR reaction to afford the production of CO. Otherwise, the 2p3/2 spin–orbital photoelectron of P, which was assigned to the phosphate, was located at the binding energy of 132.0eV [33], for the before reaction case, and was shifted to a lower binding energy of 131.3eV after reaction, which was assigned to phosphine, Me x P. This result indicates that the main atom components, Cu, Ti, and P, were reduced during the MSR reaction rather than the methanol being oxidized by them. The O1s region in the metal oxide was separated into two peaks at 529.2 and 531.5eV, which were assigned to metal-oxide and phosphate or hydroxide before the reaction, respectively. However, there was only one metal-oxide peak after the reaction. To determine the amount of carbon deposited on the catalysts, we carried out TPO measurements (B) after reaction for the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst together with the C1s-XPS curve (A), as shown in Fig. 9 . The C1s orbital is generally seen at 284.5eV for bulky carbons [33], but the peak in this study could be split into two peaks at around 282.9 and 285.0eV due to the mixture of carbide and carbon species in the coke deposition over the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The peak was shifted to a lower binding energy, which was assigned to bulky carbons, and strengthened after the reaction because of coking formation during MSR. The deposited amount and species of carbons is closely related to the catalytic deactivation. Generally, catalytic degradation is reduced with a smaller amount of deposited short-chained carbons. The destruction curves of the deposited carbon also appeared at around 500°C, so that this temperature was determined as the optimum point, as shown in Fig. 5, and the deposited carbon was 0.1%."
9,Optimum conditions on methanol steam reforming,"3.4 Optimum conditions on methanol steam reforming Fig. 10(A) and (B) shows the catalytic performances in the MSR reaction over the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with various steam to methanol ratios and various GHSV values. The optimum condition in (A) was a steam-to-methanol ratio of 1:1, so that 83% of the hydrogen was emitted at 450°C with a methanol conversion of 100%. However, the conversion was slightly decreased at higher or lower ratio. Additionally, the H2 production was improved as the reaction temperature was increased from 450°C with a straight line and the methanol conversion was optimized at 100% at a GHSV of 10,522h−1. Therefore, we then determined the optimum reaction conditions for the production of H2 over the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as measured according to the terms of the active response: GHSV=10,522h−1, steam to methanol ratio mole ratio=1:1, and reaction temperature=450°C. The two key study findings were that the H2 production varied between the catalysts according to the P concentration, and that the catalytic deactivation was retarded in the three Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts. On the basis of the performance results and a variety of physical and chemical measurements, we propose that during MSR over Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3, the Cu and Ti components played a key role in the partial oxidation of the feed gases, and that the methanol was firstly transformed to acetaldehyde as an intermediate, subsequently catalytically cracked to CH4 by Brønsted acid site in the P-catalysts, and finally changed to CO and H2 by water gas."
10,Conclusion,"The main products from MSR over the Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst were H2, CO, and CH4. The Cu(1)–Ti(1)–P(2) oxide/γ-Al2O3 catalyst also reduced the degree of carbon deposition and improved the H2 product selectivity to 83% by methanol oxidation at around 450°C. The P addition may have depressed the catalytic deactivation due to the strong sintering between the main metals. The Brønsted acid sites of the catalysts were increased by the P addition, which caused the methanol molecules to be mostly adsorbed over the three Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts during MSR, and consequently induced a high catalytic activity. During MSR, the Cu, Ti, and P components played a key role in the oxidation of the feed gases and their synergistic effect led to optimization of MSR and high H2 production over the Cu–Ti–P oxide catalysts."
