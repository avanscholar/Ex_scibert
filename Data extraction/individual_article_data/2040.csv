0,Introduction,"The increase of global temperature and the depletion of fossil fuel encourage the utilization of renewable source of energy. In recent years, the most abundant source of energy i.e. solar energy has become an alternate sustainable approach. The conversion of solar energy to chemical energy during photosynthesis, promotes the researchers to develop a platform of artificial photosynthesis system. In principle, solar light driven photocatalysts compel many functions such as decomposition of organic materials, elimination of harmful micro-organisms etc [1–3]. Apart from this, the degradation of organic pollutants like volatile organic carbons, toxic heavy metals, and organic dyes to environmental friendly products were a challenging step for every researcher. A large number of research works have been focused in the application of semiconducting photocatalysts in mineralization and detoxification of non-biodegradable organic pollutants, reductive fixation of carbon dioxide, and energy conservation [4,5]. Many semiconducting photocatalysts were already proven their importance in the above field. Among all, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), analogue of graphite was composed of an interlayer stacking of 2D conjugated framework of s-triazine. The excellent thermal, chemical and mechanical stability, high nitrogen content, good optical behavior, appealing electronic structure, and environmentally benign features attracted attention of the scientists. Because of altering localization of electrons, lone pair of electron present in N atom in the ring structure of g-C3N4 induces more polarity in the molecule and thereby increases the charge carrier mobility. The layering structure of g-C3N4 was composed of strong energetic ionic bond and covalent bond with weak Van der Waal’s electrostatic force of attraction. Such structural feature offers the opportunity to destroy the interlayer structure of g-C3N4 by chemical and physical approaches [6–8]. Apart from all these advantageous properties, low surface area, partial absorption of visible light and fastest charge recombination restricts its photocatalytic ability. Metal free g-C3N4 was tailored with different metal oxides and noble metals to decrease the rate of recombination of charge carriers and increase the surface active sites. Numerous g-C3N4 modified composites were synthesized by the researchers for different applications such a photocatalytic oxidation and reduction of organic and inorganic pollutants, supercapacitor, sensing, H2 energy production, antimicrobial activities etc. [9–12]. g-C3N4/MnO2 and g-C3N4/SnO2 hybrid nanocomposites were fabricated by Kavil and his team for supercapacitor application. They found a two times increase in specific capacitance incase of composites than neat g-C3N4 [13]. Paul and his group fabricated visible light driven photocatalyst (ZnO-modified g-C3N4) for effective degradation of MB [14]. Development of heterojunction, better separation of photo generated charge carriers increases the degradation efficiency three times than neat pure g-C3N4. Cao et al. synthesized SnO2/g-C3N4 composite applied for high performance ethanol sensing [15]. Versatile boron doped g-C3N4 (B/g-C3N4) was fabricated by Flores and his group for the selective photocatalytic production of acetone from 2-propanol by utilizing the sustainable energy source [16]. The extensive utilization of g-C3N4 modified composites with different metal oxides, such as one-dimensional MnO2 had built a center of attraction because of its natural abundance, structural diversity, low toxicity, superior electrical, optical, magnetic, catalytic, electrochemical properties and more prominent multi valence nature. These unique structural and physicochemical properties had taken MnO2, a great deal of attention in the field of catalysis, sensing, supercapacitors. MnO2 exist in different crystallographic arrangements (α, β and γ) were able to use as a filler in the preparation of nano composites [17,18]. Also interestingly, MnO2 is a narrow band semiconductor and can improve the utility of visible light. Therefore, to improve its photocatalytic efficiency, distribution of MnO2 on the surface of g-C3N4 provides a better platform for various applications. A number of works already been reported by scientists using g-C3N4 grafted MnO2 for different applications. Wang and his team synthesized MnO2/g-C3N4 heterojunction composite through in-situ redox reaction process for enhanced reduction ability of CO2 [19]. The well matched band structure of MnO2 and g-C3N4 form a hetero-interface between MnO2 and g-C3N4. This enhances the separation of photo-induced charge carriers and increases the production of CO to 9.6 µmol g−1. A novel sandwich like MnO2/g-C3N4 was fabricated by Chang et al. by incorporating MnO2 nano rod onto the 2D sheet of g-C3N4. The MnO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposite electrode was shown its best performance for supercapacitor [20]. Sanny Verma and Rajender Verma synthesized MnO2-g-C3N4 for oxidation of aromatic amines to azo compounds under visible light as source of energy at room temperature [21]. Huge tones of aromatic alcohols have been discharged from the pharmaceutical industries. This increases the toxicity, and hazardous level of aquatic ecosystem and thereby hampering the human life. Different conventional treatment methods such as distillation, chemical precipitation, and solvent extraction have been used for the removal of aromatic alcohols. The partial oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes was traditionally done by CrO3/chromium complexes [22,23]. It is a reaction bearing extreme importance in the industrial processes. Aromatic aldehydes can be used as building blocks for the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However the use of chromium containing catalysts was carcinogenic and not environmentally friendly. Use of visible light active photocatalysts play an important role in the oxidation of aromatic alcohols. The conventional technique was not suitable for large scale applications along with multiple drawbacks of the like high operational cost and low removal efficiency. To overcome this problem, photocatalytic degradation by the semiconductor based photocatalyst was the most favorable sustainable green technique used to mitigate the conventional methods [24–27]. Herein, MnO2 was modified on the surface of porous g-C3N4 (2D) nanosheet to improve the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of aromatic alcohols. The proper light harvestation, electron-hole channelization, reduced in electron-hole recombination, charge transfer through p-n junction mainly responsible in the enhancement of photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of aromatic alcohols."
1,Material and methods,
2,Synthesis of MnO2,"2.1 Synthesis of MnO2 For preparing MnO2 nanoparticles, 2 gm of Poly vinyl pyrolidone (PVP) was dissolved in 150 mL of DI water and stirred vigorously for 60 min. To the above solution 8.4 gm of MnSO4 was added followed by the addition of 11.4 gm of (NH4)2S2O8 with continuous stirring for 3–4 h. 2 mL of NH4OH was added to the above solution and stirred for 2 h and a black precipitate was obtained. The precipitate was centrifuged with minimum amount of DI water and ethanol and collected after drying overnight at a temperature of 80 °C. To remove the extra impurities the dried sample was calcined at 350 °C for 3 h and named as MnO2 (M)."
3,Synthesis of exfoliated porous g-C3N4,"2.2 Synthesis of exfoliated porous g-C3N4 Porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was prepared through a semi-closed alumina crucible by taking 5 gm of melamine and minimum amount of NH4HCO3 with a molar ratio (1:0.1) through thermal reaction process. The crucible was heated to 500 °C and clasp for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. After that deamination was performed at same temperature 500 °C for 2 h, then the alumina crucible was cooled at room temperature. The product was collected and grinded into powder. 1 gm of porous g-C3N4 and 135 mL distilled water were taken in a 250 mL beaker and thoroughly mixed and the solution was sonicated for 4 h. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. After that the obtaining residue was kept inside the hot air oven for 5 h at 70 °C. The dried sample was powdered with help of a mortar and pestle to get porous exfoliated g-C3N4 (G)."
4,Synthesis of MnO2 modified exfoliated porous g-C3N4,"2.3 Synthesis of MnO2 modified exfoliated porous g-C3N4 1 gm of porous exfoliated g-C3N4 was dissolved in minimum amount of distilled water. Different weight percentage (1, 3, 5, and 7 wt%) of MnO2 were added to the above solution and stirred continuously for 60 min at 80 °C. The resultant solid was calcined at the temperature 350 °C for 3 h and renamed as GM1, GM3, GM5 and GM7."
5,Photocatalytic procedure,"2.4 Photocatalytic procedure The prepared samples were used for the photocatalytic oxidation of phenolic derivatives under the irradiation of visible light (λ > 420 nm). 20 mL of aqueous aromatic alcohol derivatives (100 ppm) were taken in a conical flask with continuous stirring for 30 min in dark in presence of above samples. To maintain the adsorption–desorption equilibrium, the solutions were subjected to irradiate with 150 W xenon lamp with 420 nm cutoff filter. At regular time interval the solutions were discharged and centrifuged to get a clear solution. The percentage (%) of oxidation was calculated through % oxidation efficiency. % oxidation efficiency = A0-At/A0, Where, A0 was the initial absorption intensity at t was 0, and At was the final absorption intensity at time was denoted as t."
6,Plausible mechanism,"2.5 Plausible mechanism α-MnO2 a polymorphous of MnO2 was prepared by oxidation of MnSO4 by (NH4)2S2O8 as per the following reaction: 2 MnSO4 + (NH4)2S2O8 + 4H2O → 2HMnO2 + (NH4)2SO4 + 3H2SO4 The intermediate manganous acid undergoes further oxidation by using calculated amount of persulphate to MnO2 as follows: 2 HMnO2 + (NH4)2S2O8 → 2 MnO2 (blue ppt)↓ + (NH4)2SO4 + H2SO4 PVP acts as the binding glue for persulphate and MnSO4. The addition of NH4OH accelerates the rate of forward reaction by consuming H2SO4. Strong alkalis were not recommended as they do combine with MnO2 to form salts. As previously told g-C3N4 was prepared from nitrogen precursor melamine and porosity was developed by adding NH4HCO3 in it. On decomposition of NH4HCO3, CO2 and NH3 were released which make g-C3N4 porous. The layered structure of the tri-s-triazine is connected by weak forces-van der Waal forces and exfoliation of g-C3N4 was carried out by sonicating porous g-C3N4 for 4 h after centrifuging it to about 2000 rpm. When α-MnO2 was added to exfoliated porous g-C3N4, they form –C-O- bonding with the g-C3N4 surface which is confirmed by different characterization techniques like FTIR and UV–Vis DRS. The detail synthesis procedure was given in Scheme 1 ."
7,Characterizations,"2.6 Characterizations Broad angle XRD study of neat MnO2, exfoliated g-C3N4, and MnO2@g-C3N4 modified composites (GM1, GM3, GM5 and GM7) were done in the Rigaku X-Ray diffactometer in the range of 10–800 were shown in Fig. 1 . The diffraction peaks for neat MnO2 in the 2θ angle of 18.2, 25.2, 28.7, 37.6, 49.8, 56.2, 60.2, and 66.3 were indexed with different (hkl) planes i.e. (200), (220), (310), (211), (411), (600), (521) and (002) respectively as per JCPDS-44–0141 [28]. This confirms the neat MnO2 was in tetragonal phase of α-MnO2 [29]. The diffraction peaks near 13.1 and 27.4 having (100) and (002) planes confirm the presence of exfoliated porous g-C3N4 as per (JCPDS 87–1526) [30]. The modification of g-C3N4 surface with different weight percentage of MnO2 retains the crystallinity behavior of exfoliated g-C3N4, but the intensity was gradually decreasing as MnO2 percentage increasing. At the same time, the intensity peak of MnO2 gradually increasing while moves from GM1 to GM7. This confirms the presence of MnO2 on the surface of g-C3N4 and all the composites confirms the crystalline in nature. Thermo gravimetric analysis with derivative analysis (TG-DTG) were performed in the range of 50–800 °C at the rate of increase of 10 °C/min to know the presence of MnO2 in the composite (MnO2@g-C3N4) in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 (a) depicts the TG-DTG of neat MnO2, where the initial weight loss was recorded 5.63% at the range of 250–450 °C. This loss was due to the slight release of lattice oxygen and also removal of chemisorbed water molecule during the formation of MnO2 [31]. Again there was a rapid mass loss occur (20.6%) at the temperature range (550–800 °C) which corresponds to the phase change of Mn2O3. To assess the thermal stability of exfoliated porous g-C3N4 was performed under air atmosphere from 50 to 800 °C was shown in Fig. 2 (b). A rapid weight loss was visible at the range of 550–750 °C in an exfoliated porous g-C3N4 [32]. During the formation of g-C3N4, the first mass loss occurs at the temperature 200 °C due to the presence of volatile impurities and adsorbed water on the surface. Further increasing the temperature to 550–750 °C, decomposition of g-C3N4 occur with weight loss (98.03%), which can be assigned to the burning of g-C3N4 [33]. In Fig. 2 (c), in case of GM5, the residual weight loss was found to be 94%, which confirms the presence of MnO2 on the surface of g-C3N4. The loss of weight of the composite (GM5) occurred at the temperature (450 °C), indicates that the combustion of g-C3N4 which is lower than the combustion temperature of pure g-C3N4. This was due to the presence of MnO2, as an oxidation catalyst on the surface of g-C3N4 was able to absorb reactive oxygen from air and oxidize g-C3N4 at a relatively lower temperature than pure g-C3N4. The content of MnO2 in the composite also was calculated from the remaining weight present after heating the composite over 750 °C. The total weight loss in GM5 was nearly 5.19%, which was well matched to our amount of MnO2 impregnated onto the surface of exfoliated porous g-C3N4."
8,Result and discussions,
9,Oxidation of various substituted aromatic alcohols,"3.1 Oxidation of various substituted aromatic alcohols All the MnO2@g-C3N4 materials were tested towards oxidation of aromatic alcohols under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation. The parent g-C3N4 and MnO2 show 42% and 54% conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde respectively. With increase in MnO2 loading the % of conversion increases. GM1 shows 67% conversion where as GM3 shows 78%. With further increase in MnO2 loading there is slight increase in % of conversion. Among all the synthesized materials GM3 (3 wt% MnO2@g-C3N4 ) shows the maximum conversion under the said condition of reaction. All the reactions show 99% of selectivity towards the formation of the corresponding aldehydes. Table 1 shows the performance of all the catalysts towards oxidation of different aromatic alcohols. Compared to parent g-C3N4, GM3 shows a very high percentage of conversion of alcohols. In addition to the simple benzyl alcohol various substituted alcohols were tested in the given condition. Presence of electron donating groups enhances the activity of alcohol and electron withdrawing group decreases their activity. The percentage of yield is also calculated and included in the Table 2 ."
10,Stability of MnO2@g-C3N4 catalyst,"3.2 Stability of MnO2@g-C3N4 catalyst 3.2.1 Proposed mechanism Among all the substrate solutions, benzyl alcohol was taken as reference and the reaction was carried out by taking GM3 under visible light. From our previous paper this was confirmed g-C3N4 was found to be n-type semiconductor having band gap 2.7 eV and MnO2 behave like p-type semiconductor with 2.1 eV [1,18]. During the absorption of solar radiation and there will be an ejection of e- and h+ occur. The electrons from valence band transferred to conduction band and simultaneously holes were generated in the valence band. The conduction and valence band edge potential of g-C3N4 and α-MnO2 were calculated from the following formula: E VB = X - - E c + 0.5 E g E CB = E VB - E g Where, X was the absolute electronegativity of g-C3N4 (4.73) and α-MnO2 (6.19) [34,35]. Ec was the energy of free electrons measured on hydrogen scale was 4.5 eV. Eg was the band gap energy of the semiconductors. As per the calculation, the valence band edge potential of g-C3N4 and α-MnO2 were found to be 1.58 eV and 2.74 eV respectively. Similarly the conduction band edge potential of g-C3N4 and α-MnO2 were found to be −1.12 eV and 0.64 eV. As per the 1st principle of photochemistry light must be absorbed by the material for a reaction to occur. The VB band edge potential of α-MnO2 was more positive than g-C3N4 and the holes were travelled from α-MnO2 to the surface of g-C3N4. Whereas the conduction band edge potential of g-C3N4 was more electro negative than α-MnO2 and the electrons were moving from the surface of g-C3N4 to α-MnO2. Under the present circumstances, the accumulated electrons on the surface of α-MnO2 were not able to reduce O2 to O2 –.. This is because the potential of the e- in the conduction band edge potential is more positive than the redox potential of E0 (O2/O2 –.) is −0.05 eV vs NHE. Therefore, in this MnO2@g-C3N4 composite system the transformation of charge carriers should not obey the band-band transition, but Z-scheme mechanism [9,36–39] . As per the mechanism, the photogenerated electrons will migrate from α-MnO2 to g-C3N4 and h+s will accumulate on α-MnO2, because the valence band of α-MnO2 is more positive than redox potential of E0 (OH–/OH.). The electrons accumulated on conduction band of g-C3N4 were more electronegative potential and reacted with atmospheric oxygen to form super oxide (O2 –.) radicals and the holes on the surface of α-MnO2 oxidize H2O (OH–) to OH.. Both OH. and O2–. radicals were considered as the reactive species for photocatalytic oxidation reaction. As O2 –. was the principal oxidizing agent in the reaction so the reaction proceeds preferably through free radical mechanism. In presence of visible light there was hemolytic cleavage of C-O bond to give benzylic free radical. It was then stabilized by resonance with the benzene ring. Benzylic free radical was attacked by superoxide radical which subsequently gives benzaldehyde. In the valence band holes also act as oxidizing agent to convert aromatic alcohols to aldehydes. From the above study, different factors responsible for the photocatalytic oxidation process were: i) formation of heterojunction, ii) proper photo-induced charge transfer, iii) reduction of electron-hole recombination, iv)synergism between g-C3N4 and α-MnO2. The proposed reaction mechanism for one of the aromatic alcohol e.g. benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was shown in the scheme 2 . 3.2.2 Substituent effect Electron donating groups such as –OH, –OCH3, and –CH3 at ortho and para position with respect to –CH2OH group enhance the conversion and selectivity of aldehyde formation. Electron withdrawing groups like -Cl, -F, and –NO2 etc. at meta position increases the conversion and selectivity. Reactivity depends on the stability of the benzylic free radical intermediate. When there was electron donating groups at the ortho and para position, the free radical was maximum stabilized. Hence it enhances the percentage of conversion. Similar phenomenon will happen with electron withdrawing groups at meta position. But the reverse principle will take place in case of electron donating group at meta and an electron withdrawing group at ortho and para position. We have experimentally observed the same result that was shown in the Table 2."
11,Conclusions,"The exfoliated 2D g-C3N4 surface was fabricated with different weight percentages (1, 3, 5 and 7) of MnO2 for photocatalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols. From XRD, it was clear that MnO2 possess the tetragonal phase and all the composites maintain the crystallinity. The n-type semiconducting behavior of g-C3N4 and p-type semiconducting behavior of α-MnO2 form heterojunction which help in the proper charge transportation and thereby reducing the electron-hole recombination which increases the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency. The transformation of photo induced charge carriers adopt the Z-scheme mechanism rather than band-transfer mechanism. These photo generated radicals are responsible in photocatalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols. All the composites can be reutilized to maintain the environmental sustainability."
