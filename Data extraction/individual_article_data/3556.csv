0,Introduction,"The unique optoelectrical [1,2], physicochemical and structural features of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) in recent years has attracted the global attention to accomplish a wide range of research activities. Due to chemical inertness, good mechanical and thermal stability [3], highly active porous surface and large pore volume, OMCs can be utilised widely in the field of energy conversion and storage, biomedicine, etc. Various strategies were adopted to synthesise mesoporous carbon matrix since 1994 [4] namely inorganic/surfactant (as ligand) [5], self-assembly [6], nanotemplating and nanocasting [7]. Of all these protocols, OMC following the nanocasting strategy using silica as a hard template has gained a lot of attention. Ryoo et al. [8–10] has successfully synthesised mesoporous carbon and have showed that carbonisation of organic molecules like sucrose, acetylene, furfuryl alcohol used as source of carbon, in the pores of hard template like MCM-48 (CMK-1, CMK-4) [8,9], SBA-15 (CMK-3, CMK-5) [10,11] etc. and subsequent removal of the hard template after carbonisation can result in the fabrication of mesoporous carbon materials [12]. The use of semiconducting nanomaterials as effective photovoltaic devices can alternatively deal with the non-renewable energy and environment-related crunch the world is facing today. Amongst them, if the materials possess resonating absorbance with the solar spectrum with significant absorption coefficient and carrier transport ability, then they can emerge as a potential area of research for harvesting solar light [13]. Nanostructured metal sulphide based semiconductor materials which have diverse applications in the field of optoelectronic devices and sensors [14], nanophotonics and solar cells [15,16], photoelectrochemical cells and light-emitting diodes [17] often show enhanced catalytic performance if loaded or impregnated within conducting carbon framework without affecting the pore size of the matrix. From this perspective, in the present work, we have fabricated MC/CdS nanocomposites where CdS nanoparticles (CdSNps) have been immobilised on the walls of mesoporous carbon (MC) without affecting its pore size. Among these, CdS is considered one of the most efficient and fundamental metal sulphide based photoharvestors though it has certain disadvantages like photocorrosion. So with an aim to improve its photostability, various researchers have previously modified the CdS based photocatalysts either by means of fabricating a ternary photocomposite with noble metals [18] or metal oxide [19] or by introducing a highly conducting carbon framework like 3D N-doped or simple mesoporous carbon [20,21] or mesoporous Si-based carbon hollow fibers [22] or carbon nanotubes [23]. The real challenges arise from the economic point of view or due to the lack of proper electron transfer pathways between donor and acceptor in the composite materials. From these perspectives, in the present work, we have used a highly conducting and mesoporous carbon (MC) framework to fabricate MC/CdS nanocomposites where CdS nanoparticles (CdSNps) are immobilised on the walls of mesoporous carbon (MC) without affecting its pore size. The immobilisation of the CdSNps on mesoporous carbon is not only increasing the current conductivity of the semiconducting composites but also stabilises the material. The stability increases gradually on increasing the weight percentage of carbon. The carbon matrix consumes the photogenerated excitons of CdS [24] and prevents the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes effectively. The immobilisation of the CdSNps on mesoporous carbon is not only increasing the current conductivity of the semiconducting composites but also stabilises the material. The carbon matrix consumes the photogenerated excitons of CdS [24] and prevents the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes effectively."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Pluronic P 123, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), sodium thioglycolate and indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass slides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sucrose, sodium sulphide and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Spectochem Pvt. Ltd. (India). All the solvents and chemicals received were used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of the precursor mesoporous SBA-15 template,"2.2 Synthesis of the precursor mesoporous SBA-15 template Pluronic P123 (5 g) was dissolved in 190 mL 2 M hydrochloric acid solution. Subsequently, TEOS (10.4 g) was added to the solution and stirred vigorously at 318 K for 24 h. The mixture was then aged at 373 K for 72 h. The solid white product was filtered and washed thoroughly with distilled water. It was subsequently calcined at 823 K to remove P123 template."
4,Synthesis of mesoporous carbon (MC) framework,"2.3 Synthesis of mesoporous carbon (MC) framework The mesoporous carbon framework was prepared by using SBA-15 as a hard template following the procedure of Ryoo et al. [10]. SBA-15 (1.0 g) was impregnated with a solution of sucrose (1.25 g) in a mixture of H2O (5.0 g) and H2SO4 (0.14 g). The mixture was kept in an oven at 373 K for 6 h and then at 433 K for another 6 h. The black powder thus obtained was impregnated again with a solution of sucrose (0.8 g) in H2O (5.0 g) and H2SO4 (0.09 g). The mixture was then again treated similarly at 373 K and 433 K. Finally it was carbonised in a tube furnace at 1073 K for 6 h under nitrogen flow. The as-obtained carbonised product was kept overnight in 10 wt % hydrofluoric acid at room temperature to remove the silica framework completely. The carbon framework was separated by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and dried at 393 K."
5,Synthesis of CdS nanoparticles,2.4 Synthesis of CdS nanoparticles CdSNps were prepared by modifying the method reported by Feng et al. [25]. in an aqueous medium in the presence of sodium thioglycollate as stabiliser and cadmium acetate as a precursor. The mole ratio of sodium thioglycollate and cadmium acetate was 1:2 and pH of the solution was kept at 10.5 by dropwise addition of NaOH (1 mol/L). Then Na2S (2 eqv.) was added to it and the resulting mixture was stirred at 338 K for 30 min. The mixture was subsequently aged for another 90 min. The nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation and washed with water thrice.
6,Synthesis of MC/CdS nanocomposites,"2.5 Synthesis of MC/CdS nanocomposites The MC/CdS composites were prepared by a facile wet impregnation technique previously described by Xu et al [26]. Typically, a certain amount of MC (x g) was ultrasonicated in 100 mL of deionised water to disperse it thoroughly. Then the as-prepared CdS Nps (0.2 g) was added to this MC dispersion. The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously for 24 h. Finally, the MC/CdS composite was centrifuged, washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 343 K for 24 h. The composite was calcined at 573 K for 1 h under nitrogen flow. The composites were thus prepared with different proportions of MC under the same conditions only by changing the amount of MC. The various samples were marked as x-MC/CdS (x: wt % of the MC). Four different samples were prepared and denoted as 10-MC/CdS, 20-MC/CdS, 30-MC/CdS and 40-MC/CdS."
7,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurements A conventional three-electrode setup for photoelectrochemical measurements was employed with ITO as a working electrode. The working electrode was modified with photocatalyst by drop-casting method as reported by Choi et al. [27]. The ITO glasses were at first thoroughly cleansed by sonicating in water-acetone-isopropanol mixture. Then, concentrated solutions (15 mg/mL) of as-prepared photocatalysts were drop-casted on the conducting surfaces of the ITO glasses. The glasses were then air-dried and annealed finally at 473 K under nitrogen flow for 1 h. Ag/AgCl and Pt wire were used as the reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively. A solution of Na2SO4 (0.1 M) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7) was used as an electrolyte. The PEC measurements were performed by irradiating the electrode setup by a 300 W Xenon lamp with a UV cut off filter (λ > 420 nm) held in front of the lamp. Chronoamperometric chopping of the thin film semiconducting materials was studied to investigate their photostabilities for several on-off cycles of irradiation at a constant voltage of 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic measurements (EIS) were measured at a constant potential of 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) within the frequency range of 2 mHz to 0.01 kHz with an oscillation amplitude of 5 mV under illumination."
8,Photocatalytic activity,"2.7 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments were analysed by gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific, Trace 1110 gas chromatography system) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at room temperature (298 K). During the measurement, nitrogen (N2) was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 5 mL min−1. The reactor was connected to a closed-cycle circulation system. For this experiment, 20 mg of each of CdS Nps, MC and 40-MC/CdS were suspended in 25 mL of an aqueous solution containing 20 mL water and 5 mL methanol. Before photocatalytic experiments, the reaction vessel was evacuated for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen and to ensure anaerobic conditions."
9,Results and discussions,
10,Characterisation,"3.1 Characterisation The powder XRD patterns of the as-prepared CdSNps, MC and MC/CdS composites (10-MC/CdS, 30-MC/CdS and 40-MC/CdS) are shown in Fig. 1 . The XRD of pure CdS Nps shows two major diffraction peaks at 2θ values approximately at 27.11 and 47.36°. The peaks could be well-indexed to the (111) and (220) lattice planes respectively. The diffraction pattern is in well agreement with the JCPDS number 75–1546 with face-centred cubic lattice and F-43 m space group with a cell length 5.820 Å. The peaks corresponding to the (200) and (311) planes possibly overlapped with the peaks of (111) and (220), respectively due to the very small grain size of the CdS Nps. The wide angle XRD pattern for pure MC also shows two major peaks at 2θ values 22.33 and 44.01°, which are being indexed as (002) and (100) lattice planes (Fig.1) [28]. The MC/CdS composites show diffraction peaks which more or less correspond to both pure CdS and MC (Fig. 1). The average crystal diameter of the CdS Nps is estimated to be 1.256 nm from the diffraction peak (111) by using the Debye–Scherrer equation (D = 0.9λ/ (β Cos θ). The morphological investigation and elemental dispersion of CdSNps and MC in the as-prepared composites were done by TEM, HRTEM and STEM (bright field and dark field) analysis. Fig. 2 shows the TEM, HRTEM images of 40-MC/CdS composite. The lattice fringes of CdSNps can clearly be distinguished from the HRTEM image. The d-spacings of 0.323, 0.178 and 0.257 nm in the HRTEM image of 40-MC/CdS composite can be assigned to the lattice planes (111), (311) and (200), respectively which are coherent with the powder XRD data (JCPDS 75–1546). The TEM elemental mapping analysis clearly indicates the homogeneous dispersion of CdS over MC (Fig. 3 ). The HADDF-STEM (bright field and dark field) images are given in Fig. S1. The TEM-EDX analysis also exhibits the coexistence of Cd, S with C (Fig. S2). The adsorption isotherms and the pore-size distributions of MC, 30-MC/CdS and 40-MC/CdS were obtained from BET (Brunauer Emmett Teller) analysis and the analysis results are given in Table 1 . The composite materials along with MC exhibited type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms, which are characteristic of mesoporous materials (Fig. 4 a). The pore size distribution plots of MC and as prepared composites (30-MC/CdS and 40-MC/CdS) were estimated by using the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) and are shown in Fig. 4b. The pore size distribution indicates that the mesoporous carbon matrix has a narrow pore-size distribution at about 5 nm. The pore width of the composites remains almost identical (Table 1) indicating that the CdSNps are deposited on the walls of MC. The surface area of MC was found to be 770.4 m2/g with a pore volume of 0.984 cc/g. A decrease in the specific surface area and pore volume were observed in composite materials which may be attributed to the loading of CdS on the surface of carbon matrix. The optical absorption of the composites was investigated by UV-vis DRS (Fig. S3). In the visible light region, a strong absorption band edge at 578 nm is seen for pure CdSNps. The absorption in this region may be attributed due to the intrinsic band gap absorption of CdS [29]. The shoulders of the absorption edges of the MC/CdS composites were observed to shift towards lower wavelength indicating a slight blue shift in the absorption spectra. This blue shift indicates efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes thereby reducing the recombination process [30]. Interestingly the band gaps of the semiconducting nanocomposites are also seemed to be tuned, which is evident from the Kubelka-Munk function versus the energy of light i.e. the Tauc’s Plot (Fig. S4). Since CdS is a direct band gap material, so for the calculation of band gap using Tauc’s formula ‘n’ is considered to be 0.5 for allowed transition [31]. The band gaps of CdS, 10-MC/CdS, 20-MC/CdS, 30-MC/CdS and 40-MC/CdS are 2.22 eV, 2.24 eV, 2.25 eV, 2.26 eV and 2.48 eV, respectively. The flat band potentials of semiconducting materials were evaluated from the Mott-Schottky equation: 1/Csc 2 = (2/eεε0NA)(E − Efb − kT/e) here Csc is the space-charge capacitance in F/cm2, e is the charge of the electron, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductors, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, NA is the carrier density in cm−3, E is the applied potential, and Efb is the flat band potential in volt, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin [32]. In order to further investigate the chemical composition as well as the chemical states of the constituent elements present we have performed XPS analysis of our photocomposite sample 40-MC/CdS (Fig. 5 a–d). The analysed data are calibrated with respect to the binding energy value of C1 s spectra at 284.6 eV. The Survey spectrum (Fig. 5a) clearly indicates the coexistence of S, C, Cd elements with their signature peaks at binding energy values ̴161 (S2p), ̴ 284.6 (C1 s) and ̴ 403.8 eV s (Cd 3d) [25,33,34]. The peak at 403.8 eV has been deconvulated into two peaks at 405.7 eV (3d5/2) and 412.5 eV (3d3/2) (Fig. 5b) which indicates that Cd is present as Cd2+. The existence of two simplified Cd 3d peaks are also identified in the XPS of pure CdS nanoparticles as well (Fig. S5). Fig. 5c shows that the peak at 161 eV as seen from Survey spectrum actually contains two well resolved peaks at 162.1 and 163.3 eV s which resonate with characteristic sulphide peaks for 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals respectively. The high resolution C1s spectrum (Fig. 5d) actually consists of two main peaks at 284.6 eV which is characteristic of the graphitic nature of carbon. The latter peak with reduced intensity at 285.5 eV appears due to C-O or C–S interactions [35]. The intercept on the potential axis of the Mott-Schottky plot measured at a fixed frequency (200 Hz) (Fig. S6) indicates that the flat band potential of CdS, 10-MC/CdS, 20-MC/CdS, 30-MC/CdS and 40-MC/CdS are -0.508 V, -0.482 V, -0.442 V, -0.310 V and -0.262 V, respectively. The positive nature of the slope in the Mott-Schottky plot indicates that the semiconducting materials are n-type."
11,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"3.2 Photoelectrochemical measurements To investigate the effects of increasing the weight percentage of MC with respect to CdSNps, we have performed photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements of the composite materials. The PEC behaviour of these materials was studied under chronoamperometric chopping in an illumination off-on mode at 10 s time interval at 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) constant potential using 0.1 M Na2SO4 as an electrolyte in phosphate buffer (pH 7). Interestingly, it is noted that the photocurrent response is significantly higher in 40-MC/CdS compared to pure CdSNps (Fig. 6 a). This increased sensitivity may be due to the reason that the porous carbon surface of MC with high surface area and interconnected network of channels is facilitating the electron mobility thereby preventing the competing recombination process of the excitons which is the main drawback of pure CdS. In the case of CdSNps, the charge transfer property gets eventually hindered by fast recombination process, which is prevented by introducing a porous charge conducting carbon matrix. Stability of CdSNps is also enhanced by gradually increasing the MC content. Upon introducing MC, the CdSNps attains a good photostability which is evidenced from the repetitive chronoamperometric chopping of 40-MC/CdS sample for three consecutive cycles for 100 s (Fig. 6 b). The electrochemical impedance measurements were performed to understand the electron transfer ability of the semiconducting materials. Fig. 7 shows typical Nyquist plots of CdS, 10-MC/CdS, 20-MC/CdS, 30-MC/CdS and 40-MC/CdS composites. A characteristic hemispherical arc is observed for all the semiconducting materials indicating that a single charge transfer process is taking place between the working material and electrolyte. The low-frequency range of this arc indicates the total resistance viz. the resistance of the electrolytic solution or the ohmic resistance (Rs) and the resistance due to charge transfer (Rct) whereas the high-frequency zone of the arc is the solution resistance (Rs) itself [36]. Hence Rct is representing the diameter of the hemispherical arc. Lower the value of Rct higher will be the mobility of charge carriers in the photoelectrodes. Moreover, a semiconductor with minimal Rs indicates that it experiences lower ohmic resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface. From the Nyquist plot, it is seen that 40-MC/CdS has the least Rct and Rs values amongst all the materials. Hence it may be concluded that MC is playing a vital role as a carbon matrix which is not only stabilises CdS but also boosts up the facile charge transport in CdS and MC composite system. The related resistive parameters are listed in Table 2 ."
12,Photoluminescence and lifetime measurement,"3.3 Photoluminescence and lifetime measurement The enhanced photoelectrochemical activities and photostability of the nanocomposites as seen in the aforementioned experimental datas are may be due to the efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons. This is otherwise explained from the Photoluminiscence (PL) spectra and lifetime measurements since these techniques are highly helpful in explaining the migration, transfer and recombination of the charged carriers [37,38] produced as a result of excitation. Since the key to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activities is to promote an efficient charge separation as well as charge transfer, MC acts as a very suitable mediator by providing its highly active surface through which the excitons are easily transferred from CdS thereby largely preventing the decay and recombination process. Besides, this also seems to increase the longevity of the photogenerated species in the excited state. Thus the overall photocatalytic performance has been increased. Fig. 8 (a) shows the photoluminescence spectra of the composites. The main emission peak of CdS of highest intensity centred at around 500 nm primarily indicates the recombination of the electrons which are trapped on the surface states of CdSNps to the valence band [39–43]. Once MC is added, the photoluminescence drops distinctly. The quenching of the intensity may be due to the interaction of the surface of CdS with MC which results in the efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of CdS to the mesoporous carbon matrix. The fact is also supported by the lifetime measurement (Fig. 8b). The lifetime of CdSNps is found to be 4.6 ns and that of 40-MC/CdS to be 12.1 ns which are almost three times greater than the CdSNps indicating that the stability of the excited state is enhanced upon introducing mesoporous carbon matrix. This is also accredited to the fact that the facile transport of electrons from CdS to carbon is preventing the recombination process as prevalent in CdS [44], thereby stabilising the semiconducting photocomposites."
13,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared 40-MC/CdS has been studied by photocatalytic evolution of H2 through water reduction under visible light irradiation ((λ > 420 nm) using methanol as a hole scavenger. Fig. 9 a shows the rate of H2 generated through water reduction using catalysts 40-MC/CdS, pure CdSNps and MC at pH 7. As evident from the data obtained, it is noted that H2 evolution is highest for 40-MC/CdS photocomposite (37,641 μmol/g/h) as compared to CdS Nps (10,670 μmol/g/h) and MC (5136 μmol/g/h) after irradiating for 4 h under identical conditions. This increased evolution is entirely attributed to the mesoporous carbon matrix, which has the ability to promote the separation and the diffusion of the photogenerated charge carriers, thereby preventing the recombination of e−- h+ pairs as evident in case of pure CdSNps. Since stability of the catalyst plays a vital role here, we have conducted a recycling and reusability test of 40 MC/CdS (Fig. S7). The result seems very satisfactory with a minimum loss of only 12 % after third cycle with respect to the first one and this decrement also includes catalyst mass loss. This can also be correlated from the band structure of the composite (Fig. 10 ) as obtained from the optical property data. The reduction potential of all the band positions are calculated with respect to NHE using the equation ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + E°Ag/AgCl (at pH = 0). Efb and consequently Ecb (potential of conduction band, which is considered to be about 0.1 V more negative with respect to flat band potential for n-type semiconductors [44] for 40 MC/CdS are at -0.065 V and -0.165 V (w.r.t. NHE) which is just above the EH + /H2 (0 V).This band position in 40 MC/CdS in comparison to the other composite materials or pure CdS which makes it thermodynamically most feasible for the easier reduction of protons to H2. This reduction which occurs at the interface of CdS NPs and MC is largely accelerated upon interaction with the highly active surface area of MC [45] which in turn results in higher production of H2 thereby minimizing the chance of recombination of excitons."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, we have synthesised a series of MC/CdS semiconducting composites in a very simple approach. It is observed that the introduction of mesoporous carbon matrix to CdS tunes the band gap of the semiconducting material. The band gap gradually increases from CdS to CdS-carbon composites with maximum for 40-MC/CdS which is 2.48 eV. The enhancement of the photocurrent response on gradually increasing the loading of MC improves the photostability of CdS which is evidenced from repetitive chronoamperometric chopping for 100 s, photoluminescence and lifetime measurements. Besides, the introduction of the porous carbon matrix in the photocomposites efficiently separates the photogenerated electrons and holes and increases the stability of the material and visible light photocatalytic evolution of H2, thereby preventing the recombination process as seen in pure CdS. The process does not require fabrication of heterostructured nanocomposites with another metal oxide or sulphide or a noble metal such as gold to prevent recombination. Moreover, MC seems to accelerate the flow of electrons through the porous and highly active surface of mesoporous carbon as evidenced from the photocurrent response."
