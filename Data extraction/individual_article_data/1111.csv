0,Introduction,"Activity coefficient at infinite dilution (IDAC) is defined where the concentration of the solute tends to zero or in the range of 10−7 to 10−4 depending on components under investigation [1] and used to identify the system behavior in the very diluted regions to obtain high purity products [2]. Theoretical and practical applications of IDAC values in chemical and environmental engineering are essential in synthesis, design, and optimization of separation processes. It plays a role in the characterization of behavior for liquid mixtures, predicting the existence of an azeotrope and development of predictive methods for Gibbs free energy [3]. It is estimated that approximately 1018 ILs exists in today's research since there is limitless in the possible combination of cations and anions to form ILs. Even though ILs are characterized with their unique physicochemical properties for a promising alternative to traditional organic solvents [4,5], however, it is costly and time-consuming to measure IDAC in ILs only through experiments. Hence, predictive thermodynamics approaches are used as a reliable tool in the property prediction in ILs, which can subsequently reduce the experimental efforts and cost [6]. Sumon et al. [7] reported that many researchers have used numerous approaches to predict properties in ILs based on UNIFAC model, equation of state (EoS), irregular ionic lattice model (IILM), SAFT-based EoS, group contribution (GC) method, GC-EoS, quantitative structure-property/activity relationship (QSPR/QSAR) model, regular solution theory (RST) model, linear solvation-energy relationship (LSER) and Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) method [8–10]. The use of EoS as a cubic equation requires some temperature and composition-dependent parameters for ILs calculations as such classical equations do not reckon a crucial part of the physical nature of ILs. Moreover, it requires an understanding of the critical parameters. Thus, the major downside of using EoS is that the parameters are only predicted indirectly with large uncertainties [11]. The main disadvantage of using RST is that it requires details on the melting points, which is inadequate for many ILs. As for IILM, the limiting case of pure gas is broken down by the irregular ionic structure, which results in restricting the predictive ability of these equations. As for UNIFAC, QSAR and QSPR models, a larger number of parameters are usually used for the development of predictive model [12]. COSMO-RS model is costly, which is its major disadvantage. Due to different parameterizations used in COSMO-RS, the predicted IDAC values show more deviation with experimental values when compared to GC models. Articles by Grensemann et al. [13] and Klamt [14] had discussed the comparisons between COSMO-RS and GC method, also reveal that COSMO-RS achieves poor results in the applicability limits of the GC method. Group contribution methods are mainly empirical estimation methods and can be used for pure compounds, even inorganic compounds [15], organometallic compounds [16] and for mixtures [17–19]. Among all, various models have been designed during the last centuries, differing in applicability and in the set of experimental data. The models were developed to estimate, for instance, critical properties [7,20], parameters of state equations [21,22], acentric factor [23–25], activity coefficients [12], vapor pressure [26], gas and liquid viscosity [20,27], heat capacity [20,28], enthalpy and entropy of vaporization [29–32], normal melting/boiling temperature [33], liquid thermal conductivity [34], liquid density [35–37] and surface tension [17,38]. Group-contribution-based property estimation methods could also be used to predict the missing UNIFAC group-interaction parameters for the calculation of vapor-liquid equilibrium [39]. Models for ILs and their variable properties were developed in the past years, for instance, density, thermal expansion, viscosity of various types of ILs, the glass-transition temperature and fragility [20,27,33,40–42]. Multiple organic and inorganic solutes have been studied in ILs solvent and thus, the least gamma value generated by alcohol among other solutes shows the highest solubility property of alcohol-ILs interaction [43]. The experimental data of ILs mixtures were compared with GC method for these thermophysical properties. This paper aims to predict the IDAC of alcohol solutes in various families of ILs using regression method and optimization algorithm. The main contribution of this work is as follows; 1. A simple GC model (with two parameters) was developed to estimate the IDAC of ethanol-IL and propanol-IL mixture. 2. The major portion of the experimental IDAC values gathered in the validation set were used to verify the accuracy of the model obtained from the training set. 3. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and generalized reduced gradient (GRG) nonlinear algorithm were adopted to built a predictive van't Hoff model in estimating ethanol and propanol IDAC values in ILs with great accuracy."
1,Methodology,
2,Classification of dataset,"2.1 Classification of dataset The experimental data of IDAC values were collected from various published articles [44–81] to prepare an extensive database. The prepared database was formed consisting of 184 (38 ILs) and 200 (39 ILs) data points from ethanol and propanol solutes, respectively. The experimental IDAC values of these alcohol solutes in ILs are collected up to 11 anions with the combination of 23 to 26 cations. A detailed list of ILs for both solutes is provided in the supporting information (Table S1 and S2). The IDAC values were reported to be measured by gas-liquid chromatography method at a temperature range of 298.15 to 373.15 K. The database is further categorized into three sets which are training set, validation set and lastly, the overall set. All of 384 data points of both alcohol solutes are cumulated in the overall set whereas 42.97% and 57.03% of data points are used in training and validation set, respectively. Once the van't Hoff model is developed via training set, it leads to determining the accuracy of the constructed model through the validation set. The combination of training and validation sets produce the formation of an overall set, serving the purpose to generate a linear correlation between predicted and experimental IDAC values. This overall set evaluates the ability of the constructed van't Hoff model and ratifies the developed model to be utilized for all existing and non-existance ILs. The database of experimental IDAC values in training set was solely drawn from the articles published by Domanska et al. [46,47,49,59,60,62,63,65–69,71,72] (165 data points). The formed predictive van't Hoff model was verified in the validation set where the IDAC datapoints were obtained by several authors apart from Domanska et al. [44,45,48,50–58,61,64,70,75–79,81,82] (219 data points)."
3,Decomposition of alcohol and ionic liquid functional group,"2.2 Decomposition of alcohol and ionic liquid functional group The properties of the compound are determined by computing the values of all the contributions provided in the molecule using the group contribution method [83]. In this work, ethanol and propanol solutes were decomposed as follows: CH3, CH2, and OH group. A large number of ILs with varying anions and cation headgroups were separated into several groups, also including the functional group obtained from alcohol solutes. Therefore, a better understanding of the interaction between the hydroxyl group (OH) of alcohol solutes and ILs are identified via cations and anions [84]. In Fig. 1 , [BMIM][PF6] is decomposed into two CH3 groups, three CH2 groups and two different functional groups of methylimidazolium cation [-IM] and hexafluorophosphate anion, also known as the [PF6]− group."
4,Model development,"2.3 Model development Partial molar excess enthalpy at infinite dilution is obtained by Gibbs–Helmholtz expression shown in Eq. (1) [85]: (1) ∂ ln γ ∞ ∂ 1 ∕ T = H ¯ m E , ∞ R where H ¯ m E , ∞ is a basic thermodynamic function which was determined by the experimental results to identify the fundamental relationship of alcohol solutes and ILs solvent while R is a gas constant. The IDAC values are calculated using the function of temperature, ln γ ∞ that helps to determine the enthalpic and entropic components. The partial molar excess thermodynamic functions at infinite dilution are obtained using Eq. (2) [68]: (2) ln γ ∞ = H ¯ m E , ∞ RT ─ S ¯ m E , ∞ R Thus, a polynomial van't Hoff interaction is used as a thermodynamic function to determine the natural logarithm value of IDAC. The van't Hoff model is carried out by following the short-range temperature dependence as shown in Eq. (3) [86]: (3) ln γ ∞ = ∑ A T + ∑ B where the partial molar excess enthalpy H ¯ m E , ∞ = R ∑ A and entropy ─ S ¯ m E , ∞ = R ∑ B at infinite dilution are obtained from the slope and intercept, respectively. Therefore, based on Eq. (3), parameter ΣA would act as the slope as it is temperature-dependent and ΣB would be the intercept. Multiple linear regression is a tool used in designing a computational model for ethanol and propanol IDAC predictions in ILs. The model provides an insight of the dependent IDAC variable and independent variables which are the number of functional group descriptor (X i ) and the regression coefficients (β i ) of activity efficient values that are obtained at studied temperature range. The MLR general form is illustrated in Eq. (4) (4) ln γ ∞ = β 1 X 1 + β 2 X 2 + … + β i X i + ε where γ ∞ is the IDAC of alcohol in the ILs, β i is regression coefficients computed by utilizing MATLAB R2017b®. X i is the functional group descriptors for alcohol solutes, cations and anions of ILs, and ε would be the random error. In training set, the coefficient values are determined by using linear regression which was chosen from the given model types with 15-fold cross-validation (k = 15). The statistics from the 15 iterations were averaged to provide a better estimation of the overall model accuracy. The entire training set was then used to develop model coefficients. The coefficients obtained were fitted using GRG non-linear algorithm found in SOLVER tool. The developed model's performance was verified using data points in the validation set. The average absolute relative deviation (AARD%) was used to evaluate the fitting or accuracy of the developed van't Hoff model as given in Eq. (5): (5) AARD % = ∑ i = 1 N ln γ exp ∞ − ln γ pred ∞ / ln γ exp ∞ N × 100 where N is the total data points, γ ∞ exp and γ ∞ pred are the experimental and predicted IDAC values, respectively. The accuracy of the model developed will have a coefficient of determination (R2) values that approach unity and low AARDs for both the training and validation sets."
5,Result and discussions,"A van't Hoff model with two parameters is built to predict the IDAC of ethanol and propanol in several cations-based ILs with multiple anions at a fixed temperature range of 273.15 to 373.15 K. Impact of the interaction between alcohol solutes and ILs as well as the predicted model's deviation from the experimental values were discussed in this section based on the graphs plotted. In these figures, unless otherwise stated, the symbols represent the experimental data from the literature while symbols attached with dashed lines stand for GC model prediction values. The contribution values of a and b are obtained from the training set through MLR and GRG non-linear algorithm. These values are dependent on the functional groups present in alcohol solutes and IL. The coefficient values were done separately for both alcohol solutes due to the inability of the model structure to support the addition of alcohol group which is CH2 in both ethanol and propanol solutes. Thus, these contribution values generated for each alcohol solute were done respectively to maximise the accuracy of IDAC values with the least deviation. The decriptors values of parameters a and b are shown in Tables 1 and 2 for ethanol and propanol solutes, respectively. The functional groups of alcohol for ethanol and propanol solutes were merged with the cations of ILs. The contribution values (a and b) shown in Tables 1 and 2 is multiplied with the positive integers of functional groups (CH3, CH2, OCH2 and OH) and anions in a IL. Subsequently, the summation of descriptors ∑A and ∑B were add in place on the predictive model from Eq. (3) to obtain the final estimated IDAC values of ethanol and propanol in ILs. The predicted IDAC values of the studied ILs based on the alcohol solutes are provided in Table S3 and S4 (Supporting information). The detailed calculation in producing the IDAC values are also shown in the Supporting Information."
6,Linear correlation of data,"3.1 Linear correlation of data 3.1.1 Training set In the training set, the data points of experimental and predicted IDAC are fitted well to the linear line of y = 1.0098× + 0.0014 for ethanol, and y = 1.0068× - 0.0026 for propanol with an R2 value of 0.9952 and 0.9898, respectively as shown in Fig. 2 . The developed van't Hoff model for ethanol solute using 75 data points have an AARD of 4.70% and out of which 12 data points have AARD of less than 15% whereby propanol solute consisting of 90 data points have an AARD of 7.28% and out of which 23 data points have AARD of less than 15%. An additional note of 53 and 50 data points for ethanol and propanol solutes, respectively have an AARD of lesser than 5%. 3.1.2 Validation set The cations used in training set were retained while some anions varied in the validation set. The descriptors values generated from the developed van't Hoff model in the training set were used in validation set. This set is also responsible for determining the fitting criteria or its efficiency based on the indifference values of IDAC obtained between the predicted and experimental data points from the ILs apart from the training set. The data points for the solutes are fitted well to the linear line of y = 0.9573× + 0.0111 for ethanol and y = 0.8940× + 0.0183 for propanol with the R2 value of 0.9867 and 0.9698, respectively as shown in Fig. 3 . The model validated using 109 data points for ethanol solute has an AARD value of 9.41%. The model for propanol solute contains 110 data points has an AARD value of 12.06%. 3.1.3 Overall set The overall set determines the general proficiency of the developed predictive van't Hoff model shown in Fig. 4 . The data points for ethanol solute are fitted well to the linear line of y = 0.9800× + 0.0006 while as for propanol solute, the model fits to y = 0.9291× - 0.0009. The R2 values of 0.9912 and 0.9786 with an AARD of 7.49% and 9.91% are obtained from ethanol and propanol solutes, respectively. The R2 values obtained from the training and validation set for ethanol are 0.9952 and 0.9867, respectively. Meanwhile, in the study of propanol solute, the R2 values determined from both training and validation set are 0.9898 and 0.9698, respectively. The accuracy of the data points to the linear correlation is proven based on these R2 values reaching unity indicates the predicted model is highly efficient for ethanol and propanol IDAC prediction."
7,Comparison of van't Hoff model,"3.2 Comparison of van't Hoff model Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the comparison of common ILs which presented in both training and validation set for ethanol and propanol solutes. Based on the plotted graphs, the efficiency of developed model is proven based on the well fitting of experimental and predicted IDAC data points in the ILs solvents, without any major deviation in the well predicted temperature dependency. Some experimental data points could not be observed due to the overlapping of predicted data points. This also indicates the accuracy of the model used as the deviation between the experimental and predicted IDAC values are at the least. The common ILs used in both sets for these alcohol solutes are [EMIM][B(CN)4] and [BMPYR][B(CN)4]. However, only in the validation set, certain ILs were studied by two different authors which are [BMIM][BF4] for both solutes while [3C6C14P][NTf2] for ethanol solute. The average deviations were shown in Tables 3 and 4 . The predicted IDAC values from the developed GC model correspond well with the experimental IDAC which were collected from literature at different temperature ranges. In Table 3, for both ethanol and propanol solutes, insignificant difference was observed on the deviation of the ILs present in training and validation set ([EMIM][B(CN)4] and [BMPYR][B(CN)4]) as these data points of predicted and experimental trendline are met with reasonable AARD values. Based on Table 4, for ethanol solute, the deviation shown in the validation set for [3C6C14P][NTf2] by Letcher et al. [53] shows a higher value compared to Revelli et al. [54]. Meanwhile, for both ethanol and propanol solutes, AARD value of [BMIM][BF4] by Revelli et al. [77] shows higher deviation compared to Foco et al. [76] Thus, the IDAC values by Foco et al. [76] and Revelli et al. [54] that were done experimentally have shown a better fitting to the predictive model. As overall, the predicted trendline meets an equitable deviation in comparison to the experimental data points which can be further proven by AARD values."
8,Interaction of alcohol solutes with ILs,"3.3 Interaction of alcohol solutes with ILs In this section, the effects of alcohol solute and ILs solvents interaction were discussed in-depth to determine the solute potential on the study of temperature function, carbon ring, anion, cation as well as cation-anion relationship towards alcohol-IL. 3.3.1 Temperature dependency on IDAC The trends shown in Figs. 7 and 8 describe three main mechanisms on the effect of temperature towards IDAC. The first and most common concept is displayed on the decrement of IDAC values with rise of temperature in systems. The second type notifies an increase in temperature causes the IDAC values to be increased. Lastly, the third trend portrays systems with constant IDAC values irrelevant of the temperature gradient. Based on the studied ILs in ethanol and propanol solutes, majority of ILs follow the first mechanism while [TFA]− and [DCA]− anions based ILs obey type two trend. The basicity and strong hydrogen bonding characteristic of these ILs defines its unique properties towards the solutes [87]. Thus, the IDAC values of ethanol and propanol solutes for these ILs are increasing with the increase of temperature whereby, most ILs exhibiting the reverse pattern where the IDAC value decreases with increased temperature. It is further discussed as the high polarity of alcohol solutes causes hydrogen bonding due to the presence of hydroxyl (OH) group as they are both H-bond donors and acceptors As a result of rising temperature, the increase in kinetic energy exerted to the solute molecules helps in breaking the solute-solute bonds and this allows greater bonding of solute-solvent molecules leading to higher solubility. Most ILs of [NO3]−, [TOS]− anion group as well as [1-C2OHMIM][FAP] followed type three trend. The temperature interval used in this work is not uniform among the studied ILs. Thus, the reference temperature, T ref , at 298.15 K is introduced as a necessity for further discussion and result analysis. The estimated IDAC values of ethanol and propanol solutes at T ref = 298.15 K, calculated with these coefficients are provided in the Supporting Information Tables S5 and S6, respectively. The γ ∞ − T diagrams provides features that encourage on designing ILs based on these calculated predictions, as to identify the thermodynamic functions, known by partial excess Gibbs free energy, G ¯ m E , ∞ , partial molar excess enthalpy, H ¯ m E , ∞ , and partial molar excess entropy, S ¯ m E , ∞ . This will be useful to consider the various trends observed, aimed at gaining knowledge in the design of ILs with existing interactions of alcohol solutes. 3.3.2 Effect of anion The effect of the anion was studied by retaining the same cation head group along with the alkyl chain group. The variation of IDAC values of ethanol and propanol in [BMIM]+ cation with several anions is shown in Fig. 9 . The anions can be ordered as follows: [PF6]− < [BF4]− < [NTf2]− < [CF3SO3]− < [DCA]− < [SCN]− < [TOS]− and [BF4]− < [NTf2]− < [CF3SO3]− < [NO3]− < [DCA]− < [SCN]− < [TOS]− for ethanol and propanol solute, respectively. In most cases, the anions of the imidizalium cation-based ILs act as hydrogen bond acceptor, whereas the imidizalium acts as hydrogen bond donor group in solute-solvent interaction [88]. Interestingly enough, these anions trends observed are similar with the solvatochromic parameter β (hydrogen bond accepting basicity) increasing order which are as follows: [BMIM][PF6] (0.207) < [BMIM][NTf2] (0.243) < [BMIM][CF3SO3] (0.464) [89] for these alcohol solutes. In the study of ethanol and propanol solutes, [BMIM][TOS] shows the least IDAC value which determines its interaction of these alcohol solutes with ILs are greater than the rest of [BMIM]+ cation based ILs in Fig. 9. The experimental data for ethanol solute of [BMIM][CF3SO3] are well fitted compared to [BMIM][SCN] as the AARD% obtained from [BMIM][CF3SO3] is 0.33% whereas 1.69% for [BMIM][SCN]. As for propanol, the experimental data of [BMIM][NTf2] are well fitted compared to [BMIM][CF3SO3] as the AARD% obtained from [BMIM][NTf2] is 4.91% whereas 15.42% for [BMIM][CF3SO3]. From the overall set of ethanol and propanol, based on the application of Raoult's law, most ILs with [NTf2]−, [BF4]− anions and [BMIM][PF6] produce positive deviation while others contribute to negative deviation. The positive deviation are indentified on lower β values of these anions. It is further discussed based on the IDAC of ethanol solute, ILs with [EMIM]+ cation is compared with varying anions (referring to Table S3 in Supporting Information) and the anions are ordered as follows: [TFA]− > [B(CN)4]−. Meanwhile, for propanol solute, ILs with [EMIM]+ and [HMIM]+ cation is compared with varying anions (referring to Table S4 in Supporting Information). The anions can be ordered as follows: [HMIM][TFA] > [EMIM][TFA] > [HMIM][NTf2] > [EMIM][B(CN)4]. The variation of IDAC values of [BMPY]+ cation with different anions was identified in ethanol solute. The anions can be arranged as follows: [BF4]− < [NTf2]− < [CF3SO3]− < [SCN]−. [BMPY][SCN] shows the least IDAC value that proves the highest interaction of ethanol solute compared to the rest of ILs. The IL composed of the pyridinium cation with an aromatic based anion, for instance, tosylate anion [TOS]− can be an effective solvent for the separation of aromatic/aliphatic compounds [90]. This trend could be observed in imidazolium-based cation that [TOS]− proves the greatest interaction of ethanol with the least IDAC value. As observed in Fig. 10 , [BMPYR]+ cation based ILs were compared and [CF3SO3]− shows favorable interaction with ethanol compared to [B(CN)4]− and [NTf2]− anion whereas [FAP]− shows favorable interaction for propanol solute compared to the rest of anions. [BMPYR][NTf2] from ethanol solute gives lesser deviation value of 3.63% proves a better fitting of these data points compared to [BMPYR][B(CN)4] that shows a deviation of 11.73%. The experimental and predicted data points of [BMPYR][FAP] from propanol solute also shows better fitting of 3.94% deviation whereas [BMPYR][NTf2] displays the difference value of 14.72%. The interaction of cyano-based ILs interaction with the alcohol solutes was determined in this work by the comparison of [BMIM][SCN] and [BMPYR][B(CN)4] ILs. A better interaction with these alcohol solutes is observed in [BMIM][SCN] rather than [BMPYR][B(CN)4]. This interaction is contributed due to increase in the cyano group of ILs, which resulting to reduction of interaction between ILs and polar solutes like alcohol. Similar findings found in the studies by Thangarajoo et al. [12] and Coutinho et al. [92] stating the increment of CN number groups in the ILs' anions limits their ability to form H-bonds with OH group causing the polarities of ILs to decrease. The mechanisms beneath the dissolution of ethanol and propanol in ILs could be analyzed by using the partial molar excess properties. Fig. 11 displays the relationship between predicted ln γ ∞ and the alcohol partial molar excess properties calculated using the predicted van't Hoff model. Three different areas are distinguished based on this relationship of these alcohol solutes. Region (I) shows ILs − alcohol systems with negative deviations from Raoult's law, γ ∞ < 1 which attributed to a spontaneous dissolution of alcohol in the ILs. The ILs − alcohol systems in this region are composed by anions with strong hydrogen basicity which are [FAP]−, [DCA]− and [TFA]− for ethanol solute whereas, [DCA]− and [TFA]− for propanol solute. The ILs which fall into this region, the hydrogen bond between these alcohol solutes and their anion are exceedingly stronger than the hydrogen bonding between the alcohol molecules and ultimately leads to this system's exothermic mixing behavior. Thus, the H ¯ m E , ∞ exothermic mixing behavior occurs due to greater anion−alcohol interaction than the cohesive energy between alcohol−alcohol or IL − IL. Indeed, the lower IDAC values lead to higher negativity in the solute-solvent exothermicity. This is further referred to favorable intermolecular interactions with pure compounds between alcohol and ILs. A similar finding using water as the solute is in agreement with the results found in an article by Kurnia et al. [93]. A different concern is observed in the region (II) as shown in Fig. 11, where γ ∞ < 1 and G ¯ m E , ∞ < is negative, while H ¯ m E , ∞ is positive. The ILs that falls in region (II) for both alcohol solutes are [BMIM][TOS], [HMPY][TOS] and [BMIM][SCN], and few other ILs that fall in the same region for ethanol solute are [BMPY][SCN] and [N-C3OHPY][FAP]. Unique special solutions could be observed for which G ¯ m E , ∞ is close to 0 except for [BMIM][TOS], but for which H ¯ m E , ∞ and T ref S ¯ m E , ∞ are both positive. This determines the contributions of enthalpic and entropic are being cancelled to each other. These solutions do obey Raoult's law. Additionally, for those ILs, except [BMIM][TOS], the anion−alcohol hydrogen bonding is energetically weak and does not alleviate the loss of hydrogen bonding between alcohol solutes at mixing. Consequently, to recover the lost hydrogen bonding network, the alcohol molecules started to reorient themselves using the system's energy. As the entropy change is lower, the reorientation taken place would be easier. This leads to spontaneous solvation of alcohol in these ILs. Subsequently, the temperature dependence of γ ∞ in [TOS]−, [DCA]− and [TFA]− anions present in both regions I and II are rather fascinating; the system shows a negative deviation from ideality, however, the γ ∞ decreased which also reveals a more favorable interaction with higher temperatures. For those alcohol−IL systems located in the region (III), where γ ∞ > 1 and naturally G ¯ m E , ∞ > 0 kJ·mol−1, the ILs with high hydrophobic anions, such as [NTf2]−, [B(CN)4]−, [CF3SO3]−, [PF6]− and [BF4]− fall within this criterion for ethanol and propanol solutes. Again, the hydrogen bonding between anion−alcohol interactions is dominant but not somehow in a favorable manner. The least favorable interaction between the alcohol solutes and anions in this region, resulting in the formation of immiscible solutions. The phase separation could be determined by mixing alcohol with these ILs. Thus, the potential solvents could be found in liquid−liquid extraction from aqueous solution as these anions pose on non-polar properties. In summary, the higher negativity of the contribution values of anion hydrogen bonding and alcohol to total partial molar excess enthalpy, the higher the association between ILs and alcohol, as measured by the lower value of IDAC in ILs. It can be inferred that the hydrogen bond between alcohol and the IL anion contributes to the solute-solvent interaction. The enthalpic behavior of the binary mixtures of ILs and alcohol solutes is significantly determined. Some ILs with good basicity show a higher attraction to alcohol molecules, regardless of the form of cation headgroup. 3.3.3 Effect of cation headgroup In order to determine the effect of cation on the interaction of ILs with alcohol solutes, the same anion is maintained with fixed length of alkyl chain while varying the headgroup of cations. The predicted data points have overlaid some experimental data points due to the close proximity of IDAC values between them. In Figs. 12 and 13 , The [NTf2]− and [CF3SO3]− anion is retained in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively to study the effect of cation head groups on ethanol and propanol solutes. For systems containing [NTf2]− anion shown in ethanol solute, the order of ILs are as follows: [3C6C14P][NTf2] > [BMPY][NTf2] > [BMIM][NTf2] > [BMPYR][NTf2] > [COC2N1,2,2][NTf2] whereas for propanol solute, the order of ILs are as [P8,8,8,8][NTf2] > [BMPY][NTf2] > [BMIM][NTf2] > [BMPYR][NTf2] > [COC2N1,2,2][NTf2]. Subsequently, for the systems containing [CF3SO3]− anion are ordered as follow: [BMPY][CF3SO3] > [BMPYR][CF3SO3] > [BMIM][CF3SO3] for ethanol solute and [BMPY][CF3SO3] > [BMPYR][CF3SO3] ≈ [BMIM][CF3SO3] observed in propanol solute as shown in Fig. 13. In all temperatures studied, it found that both cases varying cation headgroup does not significantly alter the IDAC values. However, the structure of cations headgroup plays a significant on the value of descriptors as shown in Tables 1 and 2. It is further proven in previous work done on methanol solute which describes the descriptors values for phosphonium and ammonium completely differs from imidazolium, pyridinium and pyrrolidinium cations [12]. Weakly coordination anion such as [NTf2]− is least mattered due to the stronger effect of π-electrons from the cation headgroup. This enables a favorable interaction between cation-anion rather an anion-alcohol. However [CF3SO3]− has a lower effect of π-electrons due to alkyl replacements (butyl and methyl), which makes anion-alcohol interaction favored in contrast with cation-anion interaction. 3.3.4 Effect of alkyl chain length Cation head group and the anion are retained with varied alkyl chain to identify the effect of IDAC of alcohol-IL interaction. Based on Fig. 14 , increasing alkyl chain of pyridinium cation in [NTf2]− based IL, the IDAC value of ethanol and propanol shows an obvious reduction as could be observed in Fig. 14(a) and (b). [C5PY][NTf2] shows the lowest IDAC values than [C2PY][NTf2] and [C4PY][NTf2] thus showing [C5PY][NTf2] is having the most favorable interaction. The order trend of interaction is as follow: [C5PY][NTf2] > [C4PY][NTf2] > [C2PY][NTf2]. It also observed that the deviation between experimental and predicted data is larger for [C2PY][NTf2] and [C4PY][NTf2] in propanol solute where the AARD value is 24.01% and 26.81%, respectively. The AARD value for [C5PY][NTf2] is 11.28% and this shows the experimental value fits well with the predicted value whereby the other two cations shows a higher deviation of AARD% and having lesser interaction of propanol with the ILs compared to [C5PY][NTf2]. Fig. 14(c) and (d) shows the influence of alkyl chain on pyrrolidinium-based IL with [NTf2]− anion. A similar trend from Fig. 14(a) and (b) is observed whereby increasing alkyl chain causes the IDAC value of alcohol solutes. The observed trend is as follows: [C10MPYR][NTf2] > [C5MPYR][NTf2] > [C4MPYR][NTf2] > [C3MPYR][NTf2] and [C8MPYR][NTf2] > [C6MPYR][NTf2] > [C5MPYR][NTf2] > [C4MPYR][NTf2] > [C3MPYR][NTf2] for ethanol and propanol solutes, respectively. It is further discussed as increase in alkyl chain length causes the van der Waals volume of cation and anion to be increased. This contributes to a decreased interaction in cation-anion and expanded volume of the channel formed between cation and anion [95]. This leads to the accommodation of ethanol and propanol molecules in the pyridinium and pyrrolidinium-based IL. In other words, it can be explained that the packing effect and the smaller molar volume of alcohol solutes (compared to ILs) cause the IDAC values to decrease with an increase in alkyl chain length [96]."
9,Influence of cation−anion interaction strength on IL − alcohol interaction,"3.4 Influence of cation−anion interaction strength on IL − alcohol interaction Knowledge in intermolecular forces is a necessity to identify the properties of ILs and their effect towards other molecules. The cation-anion interaction in ILs have shown its own significance and discussed along with their relevance for its properties towards alcohol solutes. The interaction energies in the IL and their binary mixture with alcohol solutes are divided into hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. In a work by Kurnia et al. [97], by utilizing COSMO-RS for excess enthalpies of binary mixtures (IL + water) predicition, the author has described the the enthalpy of the system could be determined by the strength of the interaction between anion and water. This pattern is also observed in ethanol and propanol solutes as both water and alcohol are polar solutes. Thus, higher anion basicity causes stronger interaction with alcohol molecules that brings to an exothermic mixing behavior. The anion effect towards ILs interaction with ethanol and propanol is known from the IDAC values of these alcohol solutes in ILs as described in this work. The observation made shows that the data ranges from the most hydrophilic [TFA]− and [DCA]− anions to the extremely hydrophobic [NTf2]− anion with variety cations as well. Furthermore, the IDAC of the alcohol solutes in an IL enables us to assess the impact of IL cation, which is also focused on the anion. First and foremost, the ILs with low basicity anions like [NTf2]− and [BF4]−, the point of interaction was exhibited by the cations towards the alcohol molecules. Secondly, ILs with high basicity anions which is [SCN]−, the IDAC of alcohol solutes highly depended on the interaction between cations and anions. However, by retaining the same anion, the stronger interaction observed from the cation−anion of a given IL causes the interaction between IL and alcohol to be weaker. In order to establish new hydrogen bonding between the anion−alcohol molecules, the hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules and cation−anion should be broken. The change of the Gibbs free energy of the system is a deciding factor whether an IL-alcohol system requires higher energy to break the strong cation-anion bond to form a new hydrogen bond with an alcohol molecule. This eventually leads to a decrease in the change of the Gibbs free energy upon mixing that produces a less favorable interaction. Thus, the strength of cation−anion interaction can certainly be used as a crucial element in developing an IL with an enhanced affinity towards alcohol molecules, apart from that anion basicity. Thus, a particular IL could be determined by complementing a high basicity anion with a cation to attain the weakest interaction strength of cation−anion [98]."
10,Conclusion,"Production of ethanol and propanol as bio-fuel has been gaining attention for many industrial applications and alcohol is the green solvent that has been mainly studied for the separation process. The van't Hoff model was applied through the GC method in developing a model to predict the activity coefficient at infinite dilution of ethanol and propanol in several types of ILs. A collected database of IDAC values from numerous ILs used to build and validate a mathematical model at a temperature range. The developed model using multiple linear regression and GRG optimization predicts the IDAC value of ethanol and propanol solutes in ILs with the absolute average relative deviation (AARD) of 7.49% and 9.91%, respectively. The predicted model's temperature dependence is in accordance with the experimental trend. Among the presented anions, [TFA]−, [TOS]−, and [SCN]− shows the most favorable interaction with ethanol and propanol. These interactions have been further dealt using the properties of partial molar excess energy. The behavior of IL − alcohol system is determined based on the basicity of ILs anion, with cation headgroup and its alkyl chain gives a less impact in order to adapt the solute−solvent interactions. The structure of cations headgroup produces different contribution values as they are influenced by the presence of carbon ring structure and polyatomic ions. In this study, an increase in the alkyl chain length gives a significant reduction of IDAC values in the alcohol solutes. The least IDAC values of alcohol solutes provides a better understanding to determine solvent selectivity that could be used for separation process. In short, the developed model gives an insight towards the structural influence on IL − alcohol interaction and its significance to obtain the best interaction based on the combination of the most suited combination of anions and cations. The strength of anion−cation interaction could also be used in developing an IL with an enhanced affinity towards alcohol molecules by using the change of Gibbs free energy of a system."
