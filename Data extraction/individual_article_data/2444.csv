0,Introduction,"Nowadays hydrogen is mainly produced from fossil fuels through non-environmentally friendly processes that generate CO2 and contribute negatively to the greenhouse effect. While a large part of the present production of hydrogen is currently dedicated to producing chemicals, an increase in hydrogen demand is expected over the coming decades for use as a clean fuel in high energetic efficiency systems such as fuel cells. The thermochemical conversion of biomass is a promising route that permits the production of hydrogen from a renewable source. In this context, two possible strategies to produce a hydrogen rich gas are direct conversion of raw biomass and two-step conversion. The latter involves the production of storable intermediates which can be used for further gas production. Gasification is the most mature process for directly producing a synthesis gas from biomass. This gas is mainly constituted by carbon monoxide and hydrogen. An allothermal entrained flow reactor is often considered as the most promising technology for advanced applications such as hydrogen production, due to the high quality of the produced gas which is both tar and methane free. However, the direct gasification of biomass has several drawbacks when used on a large scale, especially in terms of the organization of feedstock supply together with the fact that lignocellulosic biomass is a resource with variable composition, wide geographical dispersion, and low energy density. All this makes the concept of a possible centralized direct-gasification of biomass strategy unviable. In these circumstances, the concept of a two-step conversion of biomass is a promising alternative. This consists of preconditioning the biomass in decentralized sites before its transportation to a centralized unit. Fast pyrolysis offers this opportunity as it allows converting the biomass into a liquid combustible product called bio-oil (typically 50–75 wt %) with a much higher volume energy density. The bio-oil can easily be stored and transported from decentralized production sites to a large-scale processing unit and the process is therefore economically sustainable. The combination of fast pyrolysis followed by the transportation of the bio-oil to large steam reforming units has attracted considerable attention from the research community as one of the promising viable methods for syngas or hydrogen production. After the fast pyrolysis step, two different strategies are possible to upgrade the bio-oil: non-catalytic (homogeneous) steam reforming of bio-oil at high temperature or catalytic steam reforming at medium temperature [1]. Non-catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil can be operated in high temperature reactors. The high temperature entrained-flow reactor has been widely considered for gasification of biomass into a high quality gas, but fewer works have been published on bio-oils. However, bio-oil offers several advantages compared to biomass, in particular in terms of atomization and injection issues. Recently, Chhiti et al. [2] reported experiments of non-catalytic crude bio-oil steam reforming under a non-oxidative atmosphere in a lab-scale High Temperature Entrained Flow Reactor (HT-EFR) over a wide range of temperatures (1000–1400 °C) and determined the composition and the yield of the syngas. They also reported that the thermodynamic equilibrium was reached within several seconds at a temperature of 1400 °C. The catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil or its fractions was first developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Colorado USA) in 1994. The use of a catalyst allows carrying out the process at a lower temperature (500–800 °C) than that used in non-catalytic steam reforming. However, the major drawback of this process is that the carbon deposits formed during the reaction can deactivate the catalyst. This has led to a second strategy which involves the separation of the bio-oil into two phases by water addition. The non-soluble fraction consisting of lignin-derived compounds can be used for the production of high value-added chemicals, whereas the aqueous fraction can be processed by catalytic steam reforming in order to produce a hydrogen rich gas [3]. Ni-based catalysts have been widely chosen for this process since they are cost-effective and have high activity and selectivity towards hydrogen. However, they are susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposits on their surface. Remón et al. [4] developed a Ni based catalyst prepared by coprecipitation having the support and the active phase modified with Mg and with Co, respectively. This proved appropriate for the catalytic steam reforming of the aqueous fraction of pyrolysis liquids in fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors. This catalyst showed the lowest coke production among all those tested by Remón et al. and was consequently chosen for the present work. In the available bibliography there are several studies on the pyrolysis of biomass and the catalytic and non-catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil or its aqueous fractions [1,5–15]. However, since different biomasses, bio-oils and aqueous fractions were used, a comparison of the thermochemical techniques to produce a hydrogen gas from biomass is unreliable. For this reason, in the present work the whole process has been considered and studied, covering all the steps from biomass to the syngas production. As a first step, two sets of bio-oils were produced from the same feedstock (pine sawdust) by using two fast pyrolysis technologies: a fluidized bed and a spouted bed reactor. These pyrolysis experiments were analysed and the bio-oils were characterized in order to obtain information about the chemical composition of these liquids. As a second step, aqueous fractions were prepared from these bio-oils and also characterized. Finally, as a third step, steam reforming experiments were performed to produce hydrogen-rich syngas. On the one hand crude bio-oils and aqueous fractions were used as feedstocks for non-catalytic experiments while, on the other hand, aqueous fractions were used for catalytic experiments in two complementary reactors. Hence, by covering all the steps involved in both strategies for producing hydrogen from biomass (via bio-oil conversion), this work gives reliable information on the yields and efficiencies obtained with each process in comparable terms."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock characterization,2.1 Feedstock characterization The biomass used for the production of the bio-oils tested in this work was pine sawdust provided by Kapelbi. It consisted of a mixture of insignis pine from the Basque Country (Spain) and maritime pine from Aquitaine (France). The feedstock was characterized in terms of moisture and ultimate composition using the corresponding norms and standards. The results are shown in Table 1 .
3,Bio-oil production,"2.2 Bio-oil production The bio-oils were produced by two institutes with two different fast pyrolysis reactors: a “classical” bubbling fluidized bed reactor at CIRAD (France) and a spouted bed reactor at IKERLAN IK4 (Spain). Both systems consisted of a pyrolysis reactor with a continuous biomass feeding system, a char-separator system consisting of 2 heated cyclones and finally a bio-oil condenser system. The dry and non-condensable gases (CO, CO2, CH4, H2 and C2 hydrocarbons) were analysed by gas chromatography and sent to a vent/flare. The most important details for a comparison of the processes are given below. The fast pyrolysis unit used by CIRAD consisted of a bench-scale (1 kg/h throughput) stainless steel fluidized bed (FB). The reactor has an 80 mm internal diameter and is 530 mm in height. It was operated in bubbling mode, at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of about 500 °C. The bed material consisted of 1.5 kg of silica sand with a particle size of 600–710 μm. The fluidizing gas was preheated nitrogen. Biomass was introduced directly into the bed through a continuous screw feeder system. Most of the char particles were separated from the hot gas/vapor stream by two cyclones heated at 400 °C. The hot gas/vapor residence time (from the top of the bed to the inlet of the condenser) was less than 2 s. The vapours were condensed at room temperature in a scrubber with Isopar™ V (an isoparaffin-based hydrocarbon solvent, purchased from Brenntag) as a spray quenching agent. The aerosols were further trapped in an electrostatic precipitator (EP) and collected in the same container. The bio-oil was recovered and separated from the remaining Isopar™ V by decantation. The remaining light condensate fraction was trapped in a dry-ice condenser and a cotton filter, both set downstream from the EP. A schematic diagram of the experimental set up is presented in Fig. 1 . All the products were measured, allowing complete mass balances. Further information on this unit can be found in our previous communication [2]. The spouted bed pyrolysis unit at IKERLAN IK4 consisted of a Draft Tube Conical Spouted Bed (SB) reactor with a maximum capacity of 25 kg/h. A schematic diagram is presented in Fig. 2 . Biomass was fed at the top of the reactor to ensure at least a complete cycle in the bed. The stagnant bed height was 280 mm, corresponding to 6 kg of silica sand (Sibelco Minerals, AGR207), with a mean diameter (ds) of 1.05 mm and a particle diameter in the 0.1–2.3 mm range. The operating velocity to minimum spouting velocity ratio (u/ums) was 2.5, which guaranteed vigorous movement in the bed and char elutriation, but without biomass and/or sand entrainment. The experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 500 °C. After the pyrolysis process, char particles were separated by two cyclones placed in a hot box at 380 °C. The liquid recovery was performed in a wet scrubber using a hydrocarbon spray as quench liquid (an aliphatic/paraffinic oil, Ondina 917-Shell), which was cooled and recycled. The remaining aerosols were separated from the non-condensable gases by using three coalescence filters. From the liquid collected in the scrubber only the light fraction, with less pyrolytic lignin than the heavy fraction, was employed as bio-oil feedstock in the following steps of this work. The non-condensable gases were recycled, heated up to 550 °C in a pre-heater and re-injected into the spouted bed reactor as fluidizing gas. The excess gas was burned in a flare. The corresponding yield was determined by mass balance with other products. More information concerning the spouted bed reactor employed in this work can be found in Makibar et al. [16]."
4,Aqueous fraction production,"2.3 Aqueous fraction production The aqueous fractions of the bio-oils (obtained in the fast pyrolysis step) were prepared by a method similar to that described by Sipillä et al. [17]. The procedure consisted of slowly adding the pyrolysis liquid (bio-oil) to water with constant stirring. In the present work, two steps were employed. Firstly, taking into account the elemental analysis of the bio-oils, water was added to the bio-oils until a theoretical water to carbon molar ratio (W/C) of 5.5 was reached, allowing the precipitation of the water-insoluble lignin derivatives. After that, the precipitate was subsequently separated by filtration and the obtained aqueous fraction was characterized by means of elemental analysis and water content. The experimental W/C ratio was calculated. Finally, the aqueous fraction was further diluted with more water in order to obtain the theoretical water to carbon (W/C) molar ratio of 7.6. No additional phase separation was observed and after characterization it was confirmed that a W/C ratio of 7.6 was reached. Accordingly, a steam to carbon (S/C) molar ratio of 7.6 is used in the reforming experiments."
5,Bio-oil and aqueous fraction characterization,"2.4 Bio-oil and aqueous fraction characterization The bio-oils and the aqueous fractions were analysed by gas chromatography using an Agilent GC 6890N fitted with a 5975 mass spectrometer detector (GC/MS). For each analysis, a weighed amount of sample was diluted with acetone (approximately 1:3 on dry basis) including a known amount of internal standards: Phenanthrene-D10 and phenol-D6 in splitless mode and Toluene-D8 in split mode. A J&W DB1701 column made of 14% cyanopropylphenyl and 86% dimethylpolysiloxane (60 m in length, 0.25 mm in diameter and 0.25 μm thickness) was employed. Two modes of injection were used at 250 °C: split mode (1:10 ratio) for the light compounds and splitless mode for the heavy ones. The column was heated from 40 °C to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min (split mode) and to 270 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min (splitless mode). In the splitless mode the temperature was maintained at 270 °C during 60 min. The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow of 1.9 mL/min. Electron impact mass spectra were obtained using 70 eV of electron impact ionization, 230 °C as the ion source temperature and 150 °C as the quadrupole temperature. The components were identified using the mass spectra and the NIST library. A total of 66 compounds were accurately quantified, making use of calibration curves previously obtained from standard mixtures. The water content in the bio-oils and the aqueous fractions were determined in accordance with ASTM D1744 by the Karl Fisher method using a Mettler Toledo V20 volumetric titrator. For the elemental analysis of the samples, C, H and N contents were measured using the complete oxidation method in accordance with XP CEN/TS 15104. Oxygen was determined by percentage difference."
6,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.5 Catalyst preparation and characterization A Ni–Co/Al–Mg catalyst was selected for the present work. It was prepared by coprecipitation having 28% (relative atomic percentage) of Ni expressed as Ni/(Ni + Al + Mg + Co), an atomic Mg/Al ratio of 0.26 and a Co/Ni atomic ratio of 0.10. Further information about the preparation procedure can be found in our previous communication [4]. The fresh calcined catalyst was characterized by optical emission spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET nitrogen adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The elemental analysis of the catalyst precursor revealed an appropriate incorporation of all the metals on the catalyst. Crystalline phases of NiO/MgO and NiAl2O4/MgAl2O4 spinels were found in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the calcined precursor. No crystalline phases of Co were detected. Two peaks and a shoulder were detected in the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis. A small first peak was found at a temperature of 300–320 °C. This peak might correspond to both the reduction of the NiO phase as well as the reduction of the Co3O4 phase [18–20]. This may suggest a high Ni–Co interaction, which was confirmed by the positive shift of the binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 detected in the XPS analysis. This fact has also been reported by other authors [21,22]. A second higher intensity peak was found at 732 °C which might correspond to the reduction of the NiAl2O4 spinel phase. This peak has a shoulder at higher temperatures, which might indicate the presence of magnesium phases [23] corresponding to the reduction of NiAl2O4 spinel units incorporated on the MgAl2O4 spinel structure. The BET surface area of the catalyst was about 132 m2/g, and its pore diameter and volume were about 5.1 nm and 0.21 cm3/g, respectively. Further information about the characterization of the catalyst can be found in our previous communication [4]."
7,Steam reforming installations,"2.6 Steam reforming installations The non-catalytic steam reforming experiments were carried out in a lab-scale high temperature entrained flow reactor (EFR) already adapted to feed bio-oils, as described in detail by Chhiti et al. [2]. The EFR consisted of a vertical tubular reactor of 75 mm inner diameter, electrically heated by a three-zone electrical furnace (total electrical power: 18 kW), enabling it to reach 1600 °C in a 1 m long isothermal reaction zone. The liquid feedstock (the aqueous fraction or the crude bio-oil) was introduced directly into the isothermal zone using a pulverization feeder, specially designed in order to obtain a very continuous spray avoiding any pre-heating of the liquid. The liquid flow rate (0.3 g/min) was delivered with a syringe pump, which was pushed automatically. A secondary N2 flow rate (3.5 L STP/min) was used to entrain the liquid into a feeding probe, cooled with water at 30 °C. At its extremity a stainless steel nozzle allowed uniform distribution with fine atomization. When entering the reactor, the spray of droplets was swept by a controlled flow rate of atmosphere gas. This gas was composed of N2 with or without steam addition (up to 10 wt%) depending on the feedstock and was preheated to 900 °C before reaching the isothermal reaction zone. The total flow rate of atmospheric gas was 15 L STP/min, which led to about 3 s of residence time across the reaction zone. At 1760 mm from the downstream injection point, the gases and solid residues were sampled using a hot-oil cooled probe. Gas and solid residues were separated using a settling box and a filter, both heated to avoid the condensation of water. The water and potential remaining tars were first condensed in a heat exchanger, and the non-condensable gases were forwarded to a micro gas chromatograph to quantify H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8 and C6H6. Further details about this installation can be found in our previous communication [2]. The duration of the non-catalytic reforming experiments was about 30 min after the temperatures were stabilized. 5 to 8 measurements were made over these 30 min in order to check stability and reproducibility. The relevant operating conditions of these experiments are shown in Table 2 . The catalytic steam reforming experiments were carried out in two experimental installations, a fixed bed and a fluidized fed. Fixed bed reactors are commonly used for testing and screening catalysts, while fluidized beds are usually chosen aiming to scale up the process to an industrial scale. The fixed bed system was based on a small bench scale reactor consisting of a fixed bed of 25 mm in height placed inside a tubular quartz reactor of 9 mm inner diameter. N2 was used as a carrier gas to facilitate the feeding of the aqueous fraction, preventing its polymerization inside the feeding system. The gaseous mixture emerging from the bed passed to a condensation system consisting of a steel vessel cooled by means of a Peltier thermoelectric cell. The non-condensable gases were analysed online with an Agilent M3000 micro gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity detectors. The second installation was a bench-scale fluidized bed reactor made of quartz, with a 2.54 cm inner diameter. The aqueous fraction was fed into the reactor by being sprayed through a quartz coaxial injection nozzle placed inside a cooling jacket to avoid the polymerization of non-volatile compounds in the injection system when introducing the feed. The gases emerging from the upper part of the reactor passed through a condensation ice trap. The non-condensable gases continued and passed through a cotton filter. Finally, the gaseous mixture leaving the filter passed to an Agilent P200 micro gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity detectors. N2 was used as a carrier gas, as a standard gas and for fluidization purposes. All the catalytic reforming experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 650 °C for two hours, using a W/morg (mass of catalyst/organics mass flow) of 4 g catalyst min/g organics. This corresponds to a GC1HSV (volume of C1-equivalent species in the feed at standard temperature and pressure per unit volume of catalyst, including the void fraction per hour) of about 13,000 h−1 [14]. The catalytic beds consisted of a mixture of catalyst and sand, both with a particle size of 160–320 μm. A u/u mf ratio of 10, defined as the ratio between the superficial gas velocity and the velocity for minimum fluidization theoretically calculated [24], was used in the fluidized bed experiments. Before each experiment the catalyst was in-situ reduced using a mixture of H2 and N2 (1:10 v/v) at 650 °C for 1 h. In both installations, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, N2, C2H4, C2H6 and C2H2 were measured online during each experiment. The relevant operating conditions of these catalytic experiments are shown in Table 2. Further information about these catalytic experimental test units can be found in our previous communication [4]."
8,Data analysis,"2.7 Data analysis The steam reforming reactions of oxygenated organic compounds were first proposed by Wang et al. [14] and are shown as follows: 1. Reforming reactions Steam reforming of the oxygenated compounds (1) C n H m O k + ( n − k ) H 2 O ⇔ n CO + ( n + m / 2 − k ) H 2 Water gas shift (WGS) reaction: (2) CO + H 2 O ⇔ CO 2 + H 2 2. Other side reactions Thermal decomposition: (3) C n H m O k → C x H y O z + Gas ( H 2 , CO , CO 2 , CH 4 , … ) + coke Methane steam reforming: (4) CH 4 + H 2 O ⇔ CO + 3 H 2 Boudouard reaction: (5) C + CO 2 ⇔ 2 CO Carbon deposits gasification: (6) C + H 2 O ⇔ H 2 + CO The theoretical equilibrium values obtained for the steam reforming of the bio-oils and aqueous fractions were calculated using Aspentech HYSYS 7.3 simulation software, employing a Gibbs reactor module with the PRSV thermodynamic package. This Gibbs reactor utility provides the theoretical equilibrium composition minimizing the Gibbs free energy of the system, which allows calculating the thermodynamic equilibrium without introducing the reaction stoichiometry. Acetic acid, acetol and butanol were the inputs in the Gibbs module used to model the composition of the feeds. One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was used to compare the different experimental results, i.e. the fast pyrolysis experiments, the characterization results and the reforming results. The results of the ANOVA analyses are presented in the form of p-values. For any comparison, if the p-value obtained is lower than the significance level used (α = 0.1 or 0.05), it can be concluded with 90 or 95% confidence that there are statistically significant differences between the values that are being compared. When the ANOVA analysis detected significant differences, the multiple range Fisher's least significant difference (Fisher's LSD) test was employed to determine differences between pairs of data. The results of this test are presented in the multiple range tables, where the results are classified in homogeneous groups using as many letters as homogeneous groups obtained in the analysis. Results sharing the same letter belong to the same homogenous group."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Fast pyrolysis results,"3.1 Fast pyrolysis results In this section the results of the fast pyrolysis experiments carried out with the same biomass but in two different reactors are presented and discussed. The operating conditions of the pyrolysis experiments are shown in Table 3 . The bed temperature was chosen to be as similar as possible in the two pyrolysis reactors. However, due to the different design and dimensions of the reactors, other operating conditions inevitably differed. In particular, N2 was used as a fluidizing agent in the fluidized bed reactor (FB) while the non-condensable gases were employed to fluidize in the spouted bed reactor (SB). In addition, a higher gas flow rate/biomass flow rate ratio was employed in the fluidized bed reactor. The product distribution and the composition of the gases obtained during the pyrolysis experiments are presented in Table 3. The results from both installations were compared with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 90% confidence. From the pyrolysis results, it was found that even though slightly different pyrolysis conditions and two different pyrolysis reactors were used in the experiments, there were no statistically significant differences in the liquid (bio-oil and water) and solid (char including ash) yields with 90% confidence. In addition, these mass yields, calculated with reference to the raw biomass, are typical of those obtained in fast pyrolysis. In contrast, statistically significant differences were found in the gas composition. Higher concentrations of CO2 and CO and lower concentrations of H2 and CH4 were found in the FB gas than in the gas from the SB reactor. These differences are likely to be a consequence of the different pyrolysis conditions employed. In particular, hydrogen is often considered as representative of secondary cracking reactions, which might be more advanced in the SB due to the larger scale."
11,Bio-oil and aqueous fractions characterization results,"3.2 Bio-oil and aqueous fractions characterization results 3.2.1 Water content and elemental composition Table 4 shows the water content and the elemental composition of the bio-oils and the aqueous fractions prepared from them. The measurements were done on raw basis, but the results are expressed in water-free basis in order to establish a comparison. The C, H and O content of the bio-oils and the aqueous fractions have been compared making use of an analysis of variance with 95% confidence. The result of the analyses is also presented in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the water content is higher for SB bio-oil than for FB bio-oil. This difference is likely to be due to the liquid collection system, rather than the type of reactor or the operating conditions. Indeed, as already mentioned above, while FB bio-oil contained all its fractions, the SB bio-oil contained only the light fraction collected in the scrubber. Hence, assuming that the overall water content should be of the same order of magnitude for similar pyrolysis conditions, it is logical to observe higher water content in SB bio-oil than in FB bio-oil. As a direct consequence, less water was added when preparing the corresponding aqueous fraction of the SB bio-oil compared to the FB bio-oil. Finally, no significant differences were found between the water contents of both aqueous fractions. As regards the elemental composition (on dry basis) for the two bio-oils and their corresponding aqueous fractions, statistically significant differences with 95% confidence were found. The carbon content was higher, at the expense of oxygen content, in FB bio-oil than in SB bio-oil. This observation might be another consequence of the different recovery systems employed in each installation. Indeed, SB bio-oil contained fewer heavy compounds and lignin derivatives than FB bio-oil, because only the light fraction was used. According to Jiang et al. [25], lignin has an average elemental composition of 64% C, 6.5% H, 30% O, i.e. higher C, lower O and the same H content than the biomass used in the present work (Table 1). The elimination of the lignin fraction therefore logically results in a lower C content and a higher O content in the SB bio-oil, with little impact on the H content. In addition, this tendency also applies to the aqueous fractions. The lignin fraction is eliminated during the preparation of the aqueous fractions, leading to higher C and lower O contents for both bio-oils compared to their respective aqueous fractions. 3.2.2 Chemical composition The bio-oils and aqueous fractions were analysed using the GC/MS method described in Section 2.4. With this method, 66 compounds can theoretically be analysed and individually quantified. The quantification results are summarized in Table 5 , where only compounds with higher concentrations than 1 mg/g are shown. The results are presented on water free basis in order to make a comparison between the chemical compositions of the bio-oils and the aqueous fractions. These results suggest that the main families constituting bio-oils and aqueous fractions are carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, furans, sugars and aromatics. Among the individual compounds quantified, acetic acid, methanol, hydroxyacetaldehyde, 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, furfural, levoglucosan, guaicols and syringols are the major compounds for each family. The total amount of compounds quantified by GC/MS represents about 20–22 wt% of the crude bio-oils. This amount is in quite good agreement with those published by Sipillä et al. [17]. Non-aromatic carbonyls (carboxylic acids, aldehydes and ketones) as well as sugars (levoglucosan) are the main compounds quantified in the bio-oils. The total amount of aromatic compounds is relatively low, due to the wide range of components which were identified but at very low concentrations. Moreover, many lignin-derived compounds cannot be analysed by GC/MS due to their high molecular masses. These compounds remain in the water-insoluble fraction (pyrolytic lignin) when preparing the aqueous fractions of the bio-oils. The composition of the bio-oils and the aqueous fractions has been compared with an analysis of variance with 95% confidence. The result of this test is also presented in Table 5. From the statistical analysis results, it was found that among all the compounds quantified in the bio-oils and the aqueous fractions, propionic acid, formaldehyde, furfural, levoglucosan, phenols, guaicols and syringols were the only chemical compounds whose concentration between one bio-oil and the other and/or one aqueous fraction and the other was statistically different with a 95% confidence (p-value <0.05). When comparing both bio-oils, the concentration of furfural, levoglucosan, guiacols and syringols was statistically higher for the FB bio-oil than for the SB bio-oil. The bio-oil composition is affected by factors such as the fluidizing medium, residence time and temperature. In this work, similar temperatures were used. The vapour residence time from the top of the bed to the condenser was higher in the SB (2.5 s) than in the FB (1.2 s). This fact could explain the differences observed in the condensation systems. The condensation system employed in the SB pyrolysis unit allowed separation of the bio-oil into two phases: a light and a heavy fraction. In this work, only the light fraction was used. In contrast, in the FB pyrolysis unit separation of the bio-oil in two phases did not take place and the entire bio-oil was used. Information about the water extraction taking place during the preparation of the aqueous fractions can also be gathered from the results shown in Table 5. It appears that the vast majority of the compounds quantified in the bio-oils remained with the same concentrations in their corresponding aqueous fractions. Statistically significant differences between the concentration of the bio-oil and the corresponding aqueous fraction were only found for formaldehyde, furfural, guaicols and syringols. More specifically, the concentration of formaldehyde was higher in the aqueous fraction than in the bio-oil in both cases. In addition, a decrease in the concentration of furfural, guaiacols and syringols was only observed for the FB aqueous fraction. This was a consequence of the higher concentration of these compounds in the FB than in the SB bio-oil."
12,Steam reforming results,"3.3 Steam reforming results This section discusses the different results obtained in the catalytic steam reforming process at 650 °C using a Ni-based catalyst and the non-catalytic, also called homogeneous, steam reforming process at 1400 °C. It should be pointed out that aqueous fractions were the only feedstock used for the catalytic experiments while crude bio-oils were also used for the homogeneous experiments. In this section, the impact of the origin of the bio-oils on both catalytic and homogeneous steam reforming results is first discussed. The homogeneous and catalytic experiments are then discussed and compared. No comparison was made between the bio-oils and aqueous fractions for the catalytic steam reforming process due to the well-known rapid deactivation of catalysts by the lignin fraction present in bio-oils. All the results of the experiments and the theoretical equilibrium values for the different reforming processes and feedstock are summarized in Fig. 3 . The results shown for the homogeneous experiments correspond to average values of several data obtained during the steady state. For the catalytic experiments, the initial yields are reported, i.e. before catalyst deactivation. The catalyst deactivation is discussed later making use of the evolution of the carbon conversion and H2 yield over time (Fig. 4 ). In order to compare the reforming results in similar terms, the H2 and CO2 yields as well as the carbon conversion to gas have been chosen as response variables. The H2 and CO2 yields were calculated as g of gas/g of organics; the carbon conversion to gas was defined as the carbon contained in the gas produced divided by the carbon contained in the liquid fed (%). The reforming results were compared to each other using a statistical analysis of variance with 95% confidence. The result of this statistical analysis, by means of Fisher's LSD homogenous group test, is also presented in Fig. 3. Experimental results are also compared to theoretical equilibrium calculations. 3.3.1 Overall comparison of FB and SB feedstock in similar reforming conditions From the experimental results, it can be gathered that the H2 yield (Fig. 3(a)) only depends on the reforming process and on the feedstock (bio-oil or aqueous fraction). There are no statistically significant differences in the H2 yield between the FB and SB bio-oils or the FB and SB aqueous fractions when they are subjected to the same reforming process. This is consistent with the fact that there were no statistically significant differences in the H content between the bio-oils and between the aqueous fractions (Table 4). Studying the CO2 yields obtained during the reforming experiments, which are represented in Fig. 3(b)), it was found that there were no statistically significant differences between the different feeds (aqueous fractions or bio-oils) and between the reforming process (catalytic in fixed bed or homogeneous), except for the aqueous fractions in the homogeneous process. The total carbon conversion to gas obtained during the reforming experiments is represented in Fig. 3(c)). No statistically significant differences were found between the carbon conversions to gas for the different feedstocks when they were reformed in the same conditions. The absence of significant differences between the two aqueous fractions and the two bio-oils when they were subjected to the same reforming process is one of the most significant results obtained in this work. This indicates that the small differences found in the chemical composition of the bio-oils obtained in each of the two pyrolysis units tested in this work do not provoke substantial differences in the yields of the posterior steam reforming processes. 3.3.2 Homogeneous reforming experiments The bio-oils and the aqueous fractions were homogeneously reformed at 1400 °C. The steady state was reached within a few seconds, and the composition of the gas remained constant over time. These results are also represented in Fig. 3. A comparison shows that a higher H2 yield was obtained for the bio-oils than for the aqueous fractions due to the higher C content of the bio-oils that shifts the WGS equilibrium. In addition, higher CO2 yields than those corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium value were obtained for the homogeneous steam reforming experiments. No statistically significant differences were found between the carbon conversions to gas in the homogeneous steam reforming experiments. These results indicate the complete vapourization of all the organics present in the bio-oils and the aqueous fractions. They also confirm that all the carbon content of the feed was converted into CO and CO2 with no methane or carbon deposit formation in the homogeneous reforming and during the beginning of the catalytic process. This is consistent with the thermodynamic results and those obtained in the work of Chitti et at [2]. 3.3.3 Catalytic steam reforming experiments The catalytic steam reforming experiments of the aqueous fractions were carried out in a fixed bed and in a fluidized bed reactor. The results of these experiments are plotted in Fig. 3. Statistically higher H2 and CO2 yields as well as a higher carbon conversion to gas were obtained for the experiments in the fixed bed reactor than those in the fluidized bed reactor. Specifically, complete carbon conversion to gas and thermodynamic H2 yields were obtained at the beginning of the experiments in the fixed bed reactor for the two aqueous fractions. Furthermore, the initial H2 yield (prior to the catalyst deactivation) obtained for the catalytic steam reforming of the two aqueous fractions was higher than the H2 yield obtained for the homogeneous reforming. This higher H2 yield was a direct consequence of the higher H2 thermodynamic equilibrium value for the catalytic reforming than for the homogeneous reforming due to the lower temperature employed (650 °C for the catalytic and 1400 °C for the homogeneous). The CO2 yields were lower than the thermodynamic equilibrium values in the catalytic process but higher in the homogeneous steam reforming experiments. This suggests that experimentally there were no statistically significant differences in terms of the CO2 yield between both reforming processes (homogeneous and catalytic in fixed bed). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences between the two processes were found for the carbon conversions to gas. Regarding the fluidized bed reactor results, the initial carbon conversion to gas was not complete, and the initial H2 and CO2 yields were lower than those predicted by the thermodynamic equilibrium and obtained in the fixed bed reactor. In order to study the catalyst deactivation, the carbon conversion to gas and the H2 yield were plotted versus time (Fig. 4) for the catalytic experiments carried out in the fixed bed and in the fluidized bed reactors. For the two aqueous fractions tested in the fixed bed reactor, complete carbon conversion to gas and thermodynamic H2 yields were obtained at the beginning of the experiments. Both carbon conversion and H2 yield decreased with time, indicating the progressive deactivation of the catalyst due to the deposition of coke on its surface. The differences observed between the catalyst behaviour for both gas–solid contact systems are mainly due to the poor gas–solid contact achieved in the fluidized bed reactor which hinders the amount of reactant having effective contact with the catalyst, diminishing the catalyst deactivation as well as the reforming yield. A more detailed explanation of these phenomena can be found in a previous communication [4]. The high deactivation rate obtained for the experiments carried out in the fixed bed reactor is a result of the very demanding conditions for the catalysts (high spatial velocity) employed in this work. These conditions were selected in order to allow an easy detection of the possible differences between the steam reforming results for the two aqueous fractions tested. Otherwise, the low spatial velocity could have masked the feed effect."
13,Conclusions,"In the present work, catalytic and non-catalytic steam reforming processes to produce a hydrogen rich gas from biomass have been tested and compared. From the same biomass, two different bio-oils were obtained by fast pyrolysis using a fluidized reactor and a spouted bed reactor. Aqueous fractions were produced from the two bio-oils. The chemical composition of the two bio-oils and the two aqueous fractions was compared. The bio-oils and the aqueous fractions were non-catalytically steam reformed at 1400 °C using an entrained flow reactor. In addition, the aqueous fractions were catalytically steam reformed at 650 °C in a fixed bed reactor and in a fluidized bed reactor using a Ni–Co/Al–Mg catalyst. The main conclusions obtained from the characterization and the reforming results of the bio-oils and their aqueous fractions are summarized as follows. 1. The main chemical families that constitute the bio-oils and the aqueous fractions are carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, furans, sugars and aromatics. The concentration of furfural, levoglucosan, phenols, guiacols and syringols was statistically higher for the bio-oil obtained in the fluidized bed reactor than for the bio-oil obtained in the spouted bed reactor. These differences could be a consequence of the different collecting system and liquid fraction employed in each experimental unit. 2. Comparing the aqueous fractions with their respective bio-oils, a statistically significant increase in the concentration of formaldehyde was noticed for both aqueous fractions. In addition, a decrease in the concentration of furfural, guaiacols and syringols was only observed for the FB aqueous fraction. This was a consequence of the higher concentration of these compounds in the FB than in the SB bio-oil. 3. The H2 yield depends on the reforming process and on the liquid feedstock (bio-oil or aqueous fraction). The highest H2 yield was obtained during the catalytic steam reforming of the two aqueous fractions in the fixed bed reactor. The non-catalytic steam reforming of these aqueous fractions provided a statistically lower H2 yield. This was a direct consequence of the lower H2 thermodynamic equilibrium value for the non-catalytic (1400 °C) than for the catalytic reforming (650 °C). Comparing the steam reforming of the aqueous fractions and the bio-oils for the non-catalytic process, a higher H2 yield was obtained for the bio-oil than for the aqueous fractions due to the higher C content of the bio-oils that shifts the WGS equilibrium. The lowest H2 yield was obtained for the catalytic steam reforming using the fluidized bed reactor due to the poorer gas–solid contact achieved in this reactor compared to that taking place in the fixed bed. 4. When the two aqueous fractions and the two bio-oils were subjected to the same reforming process, no statistically significant differences were found in the hydrogen yields. This indicates that the small differences found in the chemical composition of the bio-oils obtained in each of the two pyrolysis units tested in this work do not provoke substantial differences in the yields of the posterior steam reforming processes."
