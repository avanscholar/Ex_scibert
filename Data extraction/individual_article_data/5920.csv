0,Introduction,"With declining fossil resources and growing environmental concerns, significant effort has been devoted to convert renewable lignocellulose into valuable chemicals and fuels [1,2]. Selective depolymerization of lignocellulose can provide various key platform chemicals such as furfural and levulinic acid (LA). Furfural can be further hydrogenated to produce furfuryl alcohol (FAL) over copper-based catalysts in an industrial scale [3]. Among the downstream derivatives of FAL and LA, alkyl levulinates are versatile chemicals with numerous applications as solvent, flavouring and plasticizer [4], or as precursors to produce γ-valerolactone [5]. Moreover, the low toxicity, high lubricity, stable flash point and moderate flow property make alkyl levulinates suitable blending component for gasoline and diesel fuels. In particular, n-butyl levulinate (BL) has been proved to be a more promising and practical fuel additive than ethyl levulinate, because BL has a lower solubility in water and could minimize the engine swelling and changes in hardness [6,7]. In diesel blends containing 20%(v/v) alkyl levulinate, ethyl levulinate was found to form a separate liquid phase from diesel at 10 °C, while BL remained constant miscibility in diesel even at the diesel cloud point (−26 °C) [7]. The acid-catalyzed alcoholysis of FAL or esterification of LA with alcohols are both common pathways to produce alkyl levulinates. The application of acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation technology to lignocellulose makes bio-butanol (n-butanol) become an accessible platform chemical to synthesize BL. However, considering the expensive cost of LA as raw material and the inhibition effect of by-product water in the esterification [8], a more economic and convenient method for the BL synthesis can be envisioned by alcoholysis of FAL with n-butanol. Homogeneous mineral acids such as H2SO4 and HCl are effective for the above reaction, while they are extremely corrosive and environmentally harmful. To date, various solid acid catalysts including zeolites [9,10], ion-exchange resins [11], metal oxides [12,13], mesoporous aluminosilicates [14], sulfonic acid-grafted SBA-15 [15], supported heteropoly acids [16], organosilica materials [17], and organic-inorganic hybrid solid acid [18] have been successfully developed for the alcoholysis to produce alkyl levulinates. Nevertheless, a majority of these studies focused on the ethanolysis of FAL, publications on butanolysis are scant. Moreover, the high cost and tedious preparation protocol are major obstacles to the wide applications of these solid acids. Carbon-based solid acids, which are prepared by sulfonation of partially carbonized sugars and commercial cellulose, have been proposed as a novel type of “green catalysts” in recent years and widely employed in acid-catalyzed reactions [19–21]. However, these carbon-based solid acids generally possess lower specific surface areas which can limit their catalytic activities for alcoholysis, and they also suffer from inconvenient recovery procedure due to the formed solid residues such as humins. Besides, it is less practical for largescale applications of sugars or commercial cellulose to fabricate carbon-based catalysts in the future. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to develop more economic, efficient and easy-to-separate carbon-based solid acid catalyst for the alcoholysis of FAL. To this end, waste paper, whose principal constituent is cellulose, could be regarded as a potential renewable carbon source to fabricate magnetic carbon-based catalysts. Magnetic carbon-based catalysts are more desirable for catalysis because it can be separated from reaction solutions easily with external magnetic fields, making lengthy centrifugation and/or filtration step unnecessary [22]. As an ubiquitous municipal waste, waste paper has resulted in many environmental problems due to the human daily life and industrial activities [23]. Searching for the alternative applications for waste paper other than paper manufacturing has gained great interest. Some works have been done on the conversion of waste paper to chemicals [24,25], or fabrication of aerogel and electrode [26,27]. Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any report on the application of waste paper for catalysis. In this work, a magnetically-recoverable catalyst (SMWP) was prepared by using waste paper as a precursor via a facile methodology involving impregnation, carbonization and sulfonation. The physical and chemical properties of resultant catalyst were characterized systematically with N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), CHNS elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). Then it was used to catalyze the synthesis of a potential liquid fuel additive BL from renewable FAL and n-butanol. This new catalytic system possessed both high separation efficiency and a relatively high catalytic activity. Various experimental parameters such as reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst amount and cycle time were also investigated in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts 5.0 g of waste paper scraps were added into 0.01 M of FeCl3 solution, the mixture was agitated strongly for 24 h. Then, the Fe-impregnated pulp was evaporated and carbonized at 400 °C for 6 h under N2atmosphere to produce the magnetic waste paper-derived carbon (MWP). Finally, 1 g MWP was mixed with 10 mL concentrated H2SO4 and heated at 150 °C for 15 h to introduce SO3H groups. After cooling down, the mixture was filtered and washed with hot water until the pH was neutral, BaCl2 was employed to check the sulfate ions in the filtrate. The sulfonated magnetic waste paper-derived carbon was denoted as SMWP. For comparison, another carbon catalyst (SWP) was also synthesized in the same procedure using waste paper pulp without Fe-impregnating as a precursor. HZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 25) were provided by Nankai University. Nafion-212 resin was purchased from Dupont."
3,Characterization of carbon materials,"2.2 Characterization of carbon materials N2 adsorption was conducted at −196 °C using an ASAP 2010 apparatus. The sample was evacuated at 150 °C for 3 h before each measurement. Specific surface areas were measured using BET method. The phase structure of catalyst was determined by PANalytical X'Pert-Pro diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.1541 nm) and THEM Raman spectroscopy using a continuous laser source at 514.5 nm, respectively. Elemental composition was determined by elemental analysis using Elementar vario EL b apparatus. XPS analysis was conducted with an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using Al Kα X-ray source with pass energy of 20 eV. FT-IR was recorded by a VERTEX 70 with the KBr pellet ranging from 500 to 4000 cm−1. NH3-TPD was conducted with a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 Automated Catalyst Characterization System coupling with a mass spectrometry detector. Before each test, 0.1 g sample was placed in a quartz reactor, pretreated in He flow at 120 °C for 1 h and cooled down to 100 °C. After the saturated adsorption NH3, the sample was heated at 100 °C in He for 30 min to remove the physically adsorbed NH3. Desorption of NH3 was conducted in He flow from 100 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The desorbed NH3 molecules were detected by a MS OminiStar equipped with the software quadstar 32-bit."
4,Alcoholysis of FAL and n-butanol,"2.3 Alcoholysis of FAL and n-butanol Typically, 0.196 g FAL, 7.4 g n-butanol and 0.08 g catalyst were added into a Parr batch reactor. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated at 120 °C after introduction of N2. The liquid sample was separated by centrifuging and analysed by HP6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-INNOWAX capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 μm film) and a flame ionization detector. The intermediates were identified by mass spectrometry coupled with gas chromatography (Agilent 6890 GC-5973MSD). The catalytic activity was evaluated quantitatively by the yield of BL (Y, %). Here, Y (%) = (MD/ML) × 100, where MD and ML is the number of moles of BL produced and expected, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectra of MWP and SMWP. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 30.1°, 35.4°, 43.1°, 57.1° and 62.6° were assigned to (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) lattice planes of Fe3O4 (JCPDS Card No. 190629) [28], which indicated that only Fe3O4 component was formed in the carbonization process and its structure was not obviously affected in the sulfonation process. The formation mechanism of Fe3O4 includes two steps: The FeCl3 was firstly hydrolyzed into FeO(OH) in the evaporation process. Then, the FeO(OH) was reduced into Fe3O4 by the reducing components such as H2, CO and amorphous carbon, which were formed in the carbonization process. The weak and broad peak at 15–30° was attributed to C (002), demonstrating that C components were in the amorphous state [29], which can be evidentially confirmed by D-band and G-band of amorphous carbons in the spectrum of Raman (see Fig. S1) [19]. Furthermore, the enhanced intensity of C (002) on SMWP implied that sulfonation not only introduced SO3H groups but also led to the further carbonization of the carbon precursor MWP. The increased carbon content in elemental analysis (57.39% vs. 52.16%, see Table S1) also proved this point. The specific surface area of SMWP was 402.1 m2 g−1 based on the N2 adsorption results, which was significantly higher than that of SMP at 2.5 m2 g−1 (see Table S1). The porous morphology of SMWP was further proved by SEM images shown in Fig. 2 . A rough surface morphology and obvious cavities were observed on the fiber-like structure of SMWP, while SWP was nearly devoid of pores. This result indicated that the presence of Fe could promote the formation of porous structure because the dehydration and decomposition of FeCl3 will enhance the release of volatiles such as HCl, H2O, H2, CO and CO2 in the carbonization process [30]. Moreover, the S and Fe elements were both determined to be homogeneously distributed on the entire surface of SMWP according to SEM-EDS mapping (see Fig. S2), suggesting effective incorporation of Fe and sulfonation of the carbon composite. The various functional group on SMWP was detected by FT-IR. As illustrated in Fig. 3 a, the peak at 587 cm−1 was assigned to Fe–O stretching vibration in Fe3O4 components [31]. The bands at 1035, 1178 and 1394 cm−1 corresponded to O=S=O stretching vibration in SO3H groups [22], indicating SO3H groups have been successfully incorporated into SMWP. The band at 1610, 1708 and 3400 cm−1 were due to the stretching vibration of C=C in aromatic carbons, C=O in COOH groups, O–H in COOH and phenolic OH groups, respectively [22]. Convincingly, the presence of the above-mentioned groups can be further verified by the energy state of C and S in the spectrum of XPS. The C 1s spectrum of SMWP presented four peaks with binding energies of 284.0, 284.6, 286.0 and 288.5 eV via the deconvolution (Fig. 3c), which can be assigned to the carbon atom in C–S, C–C, C–O (alcoholic, phenolic hydroxyl and/or ether) and O–C=O (carboxyl groups) [30,31]. The S 2p spectrum (Fig. 3d) can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 167.7, 168.7 and 169.9 eV, which were attributed to the binding energies of S–C, S–O and S=O [32]. It further indicated that the S component in SMWP was only in the form of SO3H groups bonded to carbon matrix. Therefore, the SO3H density in SMWP was calculated to be 0.67 mmol g−1 according to the S content in the catalyst composition (2.15 wt%, see Table S1), the value was lower than its total acid density determined by NH3 adsorption (0.67 v.s. 1.21 mmol g−1). The reason can be attributed to a few other acidic groups such as COOH and phenolic OH groups present on the SMWP. The acid strength of magnetic carbon composites before and after sulfonation were compared by NH3-TPD. As shown in Fig. 4 , they both demonstrated a desorption peak ranging from 120 °C to 350 °C, which indicated the existence of weak acid sites due to interaction of NH3 with incompletely formed carbon sheets and COOH groups [33]. The distinctive peak maximized at 650 °C on SMWP was ascribed to the presence of strong acid sites due to desorption of SO3H groups [21]. The TPD result revealed that SMWP possessed stronger acid strength than MWP."
7,Preliminary study on the alcoholysis activity,"3.2 Preliminary study on the alcoholysis activity The SMWP catalyst was evaluated in the alcoholysis reaction of FAL at 120 °C for 6 h when the molar ratio of n-butanol to FAL was 50. 2-butoxymethylfuran (BMF) was identified as the main intermediate according to GC-MS results (see Fig. S3). Dibutyl ether was the by-product derived from the non-productive consumption of n-butanol, so it was less discussed in the following work. The product yield as a function of reaction time over SMWP is displayed in Fig. 5 . The reaction proceeded rapidly and FAL was almost completely converted after only 1 h, while only 39.0% yield of BL and 50.8% yield of BMF were formed. The yield of BL increased gradually with the reaction time, reaching a maximum point of 90.6% in 5 h, after which there was no further increase in the BL yield. Therefore, 5 h was regarded as the optimal reaction time and employed in the following study. Meanwhile, a volcano trend in the BMF yield was observed. This implied that the butanolysis of FAL occurred through the formation of BMF as intermediate which further converted to BL as the reaction progressed (Scheme 1 ). Particularly, the conversion of BMF to BL should be the rate-determining step due to the rapid consumption of FAL to BMF but further slow transformation of BMF to BL. In order to exclude the effect of mass transfer limitation, the effect of agitation speed was studied from 200 to 800 rpm, beyond 500 rpm, there was absence of external mass transfer resistance (see Fig. S4a). Meanwhile, particle size over 100 mesh had no effect on the yield of BL, inferring that the internal mass transfer resistance was negligible (see Fig. S4b). Thus, 500 rpm and 100–200 mesh were used in our following optimization."
8,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature The effect of temperature on FA alcoholysis over SMWP catalyst was carried out at different reaction temperatures ranging from 80 °C to 140 °C and the result is shown in Fig. 6 . When the reaction was performed at 80 °C, there was large amount of FAL remained unchanged and the BL yield was extremely low, indicating that the formation of required intermediate BMF was difficult at 80 °C. With the increasing temperature from 80 °C to 100 °C, the conversion of FAL increased significantly with a sharp increase in the BL yield and decrease in the BMF yield. Alcoholysis of FAL is an endothermic reaction, reaction temperature has a substantial impact on reaction rate which in turn influences the FAL conversion. The high yield of BMF at lower temperature can be explained by the different activation energy for the two reaction steps shown in Scheme 1. It has been known that the etherification of FAL (step 1) requires a relatively low activation energy compared with the transformation of ether intermediate to BL (step 2), thus leading to a faster reaction rate of step 1 and a higher yield of BMF intermediate [9,34]. On the contrary, increasing the reaction temperature referred to increasing the amount of energy available in the system. This allows for activating more BMF molecules, thus facilitating the reaction rate of step 2. As a result, the BMF was quickly consumed and the yield of BL increased. A further increase in temperature to 120 °C led to the complete conversion of FAL, and the BL yield increased continuously to the maximum with a drastic decrease in the yield of intermediate. Further increase in the temperature to 140 °C had negligible influence on the products distribution. The results demonstrated that the optimal reaction temperature for the butanolysis of FAL was 120 °C."
9,Effect of catalyst amount,"3.4 Effect of catalyst amount The effect of catalyst amount on the alcoholysis of FAL was conducted at 120 °C by varying the catalyst amount from 0.02 g to 0.12 g and the result is shown in Fig. 7 . When the catalyst amount was in the range of 0.02–0.04 g, the conversion of FAL was moderate and the BMF was observed to be the dominant product, which indicated that there was an insufficient number of acid sites to convert the formed intermediate to final product BL. Increasing the catalyst amount from 0.04 to 0.08 g tended to increase the availability and accessibility of more active sites for the intermediate, as the yield of BMF decreased obviously from 44.2% to 6.0%. A minimum catalyst amount of 0.08 g was essential for the maximum conversion of BMF to BL. The optimized results showed that a moderate reaction condition of 120 °C and 40 wt% catalyst loading (0.08 g) were enough to allow full conversion of the reactants and intermediates to obtain the highest yield of BL."
10,Comparison with various acid catalysts,"3.5 Comparison with various acid catalysts For comparison, the alcoholysis activities of unsulfonated magnetic carbon (MWP) and some typical solid acids (HZSM-5 zeolite and Nafion-212 resin) were also evaluated. As shown in Table 1 , MWP exhibited negligible catalytic activity under the same reaction conditions (Entry 1). The disparate catalytic behaviour between SMWP and MWP can be ascribed to the strong acidity of SMWP, as it has been proved by NH3-TPD. To verify this speculation, a comparative test was carried out under the catalysis of H2SO4, H3PO4 and CH3COOH which represents strong acid, medium acid and weak acid, respectively (Entry 5–7). The sequence for the BL yield was H2SO4 > H3PO4 > CH3COOH, which was consistent with their acid strength. The result further proved that stronger acidity was desirable for the alcoholysis of FAL to produce BL. It is worth noting that in the reaction catalyzed by H2SO4, some black residue was observed in the reaction mixture and this indicated that FAL might polymerized to oligomeric condensation products under such harsh reaction conditions. That is the reason why the BL yield obtained over H2SO4 was lower than that obtained over SMWP catalyst even though the conversion on both catalysts were the same. As CH3COOH did not exhibit obvious activity, weak COOH groups were recognized to be unable to effectively catalyze this reaction. Therefore, SO3H groups were the intrinsic active sites on SMWP. For HZSM-5 zeolite, 82.7% FAL was converted while BMF was still the dominant product even after 5 h reaction time (Entry 3). The lower BL yield was likely attributed to the weak acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite as its maximum NH3 desorption temperature was only 430 °C (see Fig. S5), which may limit the acid transformation of BMF into BL. Some researchers once reported that the small pore size of HZSM-5 (0.57 × 0.51 nm) was also responsible for its lower activity, since the access of the reactants to the catalytic acid sites located inside the porous system was limited for this catalyst [9,35]. Nafion-212 is a perfluorinated sulfonic acid resin that is often denoted as a superacid. The acid strength of SO3H group is enhanced by the presence of fluorine, which makes its acid strength higher than that of sulfonated carbon [36]. However, it is worth noting that Nafion-212 resin displayed a lower reactivity than SMWP (Entry 4), suggesting that strong acidity was not the only factor to influence the alcoholysis of FAL. As shown in Table S2, the SO3H density of Nafion-212 was also higher than that of SMWP catalyst (1.10 vs.0.67 mmol g−1). Considering the influence of different SO3H density on the acid catalytic activity, the alcoholysis activity of Nafion-212 is also compared with the SMWP catalyst in terms of turnover frequency (TOF). TOF is one indicator for the efficiency of a catalyst related to the number of times overall catalytic reaction takes place per hypothetical active site per unit time. The TOF value obtained with Nafion-212 resin was found to be much lower than that obtained on SMWP catalyst (5.3 vs. 20.8 h−1). As is well known, the difference between Nafion-212 and SMWP is that Nafion-212 only contains SO3H groups, whereas SMWP possesses other groups such as COOH and phenolic OH groups as well as SO3H groups. These exclusive functional groups of SMWP may play a crucial role in promoting the conversion of FAL. The hypothesis was confirmed by the FAL adsorption test (see Table S3). SMWP catalyst demonstrated much stronger adsorption capacity of FAL than Nafion-212 (1.375 vs. 0.725 g g−1), indicating its better affinity to the substrate. The phenomenon can be rationalized by the COOH and phenolic OH groups on SMWP which can adsorb hydroxyl group of FAL through forming hydrogen bonds, thus promoting the alcoholysis reaction. Consequently, the superior performance of SMWP catalyst could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of SO3H, COOH and phenolic OH groups in FAL alcoholysis. SO3H groups played the role of active sites by protonating the FAL molecules, other oxygen-containing functional groups on the catalyst surface facilitated the adsorption of FAL. Similar synergistic effects of oxygen-containing functional groups on carbonaceous materials have been observed in the esterification of fatty acid [37,38]."
11,Catalyst recycling test,"3.6 Catalyst recycling test The reusability of catalyst is extremely vital to evaluate the efficiency of catalyst. As depicted in Fig. 8 a, the catalyst could be easily collected with the aid of a permanent magnet after alcoholysis reaction, after washing and drying overnight, the recycled SMWP was applied in the next cycle under the same conditions. Fig. 8b shows the waste paper-derived catalyst could be repeatedly employed for at least 7 cycles and still retained around 90% of its original catalytic activity, indicating satisfied operational stability similar to sulfonated carbon catalyst from pure glucose reported previously [39,40]. A hot filtration test was carried out to exclude the possibility of homogeneous catalysis. The SMWP catalyst was filtered out after 2 h and the reaction was continued with the filtrate under same conditions. The reaction stopped when the catalyst was removed away, but the reaction continued after the SMWP was re-added (see Fig. S6). The result proved that the leaching of SO3H active species was negligible. Besides, the S content of the 7th reused catalyst was found to be close to that of the fresh catalyst based on the elemental analysis (2.02 vs. 2.15 wt%), therefore, the slight decrease in the BL yield over the spent SMWP should be attributed to adsorption of some oligomeric by-products on the surface of SMWP, which may decrease the accessibility of the acid sites."
12,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a novel magnetic carbonaceous catalyst derived from waste paper (SMWP) was firstly synthesized through an integrated impregnation–carbonization–sulfonation process. This catalyst combined the advantages of high surface area, strong acidity and good magnetic separability. It exhibited a good catalytic activity and stability for the butanolysis of FAL, leading to a high BL yield of 90.6% with 100% FAL conversion at moderate reaction conditions. The superior performance of SMWP can be ascribed to its strong acidity and good affinity to FAL, which resulted from the synergistic effect of SO3H, COOH and phenolic OH groups on the catalyst surface. SO3H groups were identified to be the dominant active sites. Moreover, SMWP could be reused seven times without a distinct loss of catalytic activity. The environmentally benign catalyst SMWP would find wide applications for other acid-catalyzed chemical reactions."
