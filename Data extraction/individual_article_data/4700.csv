0,Introduction,"Arthritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of one or more joints often characterized by pain and structural changes in the location where the disease is occurring (Mobasheri and Batt, 2016). It can be triggered by several causes including inflammation, crystal deposition (e.g., urea crystals), lesions, abnormal metabolism, infections, and dysfunction of the immune system (Amodwala et al., 2017). Out of different forms of arthritis, the most common type is rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that is characterized by synovial hyperplasia, progressive destruction of cartilage that surrounds the bone, and excessive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and lymphokines (Garg et al., 2016). Up to date, there is no cure for RA; however, clinical studies report the attenuation and remission of symptoms with medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Emery et al., 2013). This class of drug includes different types of medications, and their prescription depends on the severity of the patient́s symptoms and how long he/she had RA. The conventional DMARDs, for example, include drugs capable of slowing the progression of RA and saving the joints and other tissues from permanent damage (Feely and O'Dell, 2010). Among these drugs, methotrexate (MTX) has been widely utilized in RA treatment as well as in the treatment of psoriasis and some types of cancer. Overall, MTX has an excellent inhibitory efficacy on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and delays disease progression in the affected joints (Guo et al., 2018). Although the high efficiency of MTX, when administered orally, it was shown to alter the diversity and the main components of oral and intestinal microbiota, thereby affecting the inflammatory response associated with damage to the mucosal epithelium (der Beek et al., 2016). Alternatively, MTX can be intra-articularly administered, where it is injected directly into the synovial cavity of a joint (Tada et al., 2019). Nevertheless, studies have shown that high concentrations or multiple applications were required for MTX to be effective on the spot, which increases the risk of infection and short duration (Wang et al., 2018). Due to these limitations and potential issues associated with the MTX administration, researchers have sought new delivery strategies. Promising studies focus on carrier systems that perform the controlled and targeted delivery of MTX to the target site of RA (Guo et al., 2021; Shan et al., 2020). One way to minimize side effects in the gastrointestinal tract is the administration of MTX through drug delivery systems (DDS) by transdermal routes (Tekko et al., 2020a). DDS can prolong the therapeutic action of MTX at the treated site with a painless and minimally invasive action. Such characteristics are essential for the treatment of RA, due to its ease of being deposited in the place to be treated, and afterward, there is the supply of the drug for a continuous release, inhibiting the proliferation of proinflammatory cytokines (Chan and Cronstein, 2002). Taking into account the DDS, the use of polymeric films has gained prominence due to their low cost, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and easy processability. Polymer films are also adequate and practical devices to supply the drug in the place to be treated (Gularte et al., 2020; Tran and Tran, 2019). Among the polymers that can be used in the preparation of such films, cationic starch (CSt) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are attractive mainly due to their physicochemical and biological properties (Amodwala et al., 2017; Gularte et al., 2020). CSt is a synthetic polymer, derived from the biopolymer starch, which contains positively chargeable groups on its backbone (such as amine, imine, sulfonic, phosphonium, or quaternary ammonium groups) (Pan et al., 2019). This starch derivative has high water-solubility, excellent film-forming properties, and antimicrobial activities (Pan et al., 2019). PVA is a synthetic, hydrophilic, and semi-crystalline polymer that has been widely used for preparing DDS (Kamoun et al., 2015). Despite these interesting properties, films of CSt/PVA have not been exploited for MTX incorporation and delivery. Based on this, in this study, we exploited the preparation of films of CSt/PVA as a strategy to incorporate and release MTX, as well as the in vivo evaluation in a model of rheumatoid arthritis in mice. We also prepared CSt/PVA films containing chondroitin sulfate (ChS), a glycosaminoglycan often recommended for attenuating and treating RA symptoms (Zhou et al., 2010). The combination of biopolymers found in the extracellular matrix, such as ChS, with other polymers can benefit the interaction of the resulting materials with living organisms, beyond enhancing their biological performance towards degenerative joint diseases, including RA (Chattopadhyay et al., 2020). ChS is predominantly found in the extracellular matrix, especially around cartilage, skin, blood vessels, ligaments, and tendons (Largo et al., 2010). The administration of ChS has been shown to play an important role in reducing the signs and symptoms of synovitis, preventing the infiltration of inflammatory cells, granulated tissue formation, articular cartilage destruction, and edema reduction (Mahtab et al., 2020). These characteristics may benefit the CSt/PVA film by increasing the RA treatment process, together with the drug MTX. A series of CSt/PVA/ChS films were prepared and their ability to act as a DDS for MTX was investigated through different characterization techniques. The profile of permeation of MTX was assessed in vitro using porcine skin as the biological barrier and in vivo assays using a model of Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis in mice was utilized to investigate the potential pharmacological properties of the MTX-loaded films. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting this strategy for RA treatment."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Rice starch (6% of amylose) was kindly donated by LabGrãos/UFPel (Pelotas, RS, Brazil). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, 98% hydrolyzed and Mw of 124,000 g/mol), chondroitin sulfate A sodium salt from the bovine trachea (ChS), (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)trimethylammonium chloride (CHPTAC), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Methotrexate (MTX, 99%) was purchased from Libbs Pharmaceutical (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Ethanol (P.A.) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36%) were purchased from Synth (Diadema, SP, Brazil). Methanol was acquired from Dinâmica (São Paulo, Brazil). Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was purchased from LiChrosolv (Darmstadt, Germany). Triethanolamine was bought from Vetec (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Carbopol Ultrez® hydrogel was purchased from Galena (Campinas, SP, Brazil). All other reagents and solvents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification."
3,Animals,"2.2 Animals Adult male Swiss mice (two months old, 25–35 g) were obtained from the Central Animal House of the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel, Brazil). The animals were kept in plastic cages at an acclimatized (22 ± 2 °C) animal room, under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (the lights were turned on at 07:00 a.m.). A commercial rodent pellet diet and filtered water were provided ad libitum. Mice were acclimatized for one week before the commencement of the experiments. The experimental protocol was approved by the Committee on Care and Use of Experimental Resources of the Federal University of Pelotas (Brazil), affiliated to the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation and registered under the number 22123-2020. All experimental procedures were performed following the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 823, revised 1978) and every effort was made to reduce both the number of animals used and their discomfort."
4,Preparation of CSt/PVA and CSt/PVA/ChS films,"2.3 Preparation of CSt/PVA and CSt/PVA/ChS films Firstly, cationic starch (CSt) was synthesized according to the procedure reported by Gularte et al. (2020) without modifications. The degree of substitution (DS) for CSt was calculated to be 0.7. To prepare the films, CSt (100 mg) was solubilized in distilled water (5 mL) under magnetic stirring (250 rpm) at room temperature. Separately, PVA (1000 mg) was also solubilized in distilled water (15 mL), remaining under magnetic agitation at 80 °C temperature, up until the solution became homogeneous. Next, CSt and PVA solutions were blended and homogenized under magnetic stirring (100 rpm) for 3 h at room temperature. The CSt:PVA mass ratio was fixed at 1:10 from previous experiments. The homogeneous CSt/PVA solution was poured in a Petri dish (round-plate shape 85 × 10 mm) and the solvent was evaporated in an oven at 40 °C for 48 h. For the CSt/PVA films containing ChS (denoted as CSt/PVA/ChS) a similar protocol was utilized with minor modifications. Herein, 55 mg of ChS was added to the CSt/PVA solution (20 mL of distilled water) under gently stirring (100 rpm for 3 h) at room temperature. The amount of ChS corresponds to 5 w/w-% of the total CSt/PVA mass used in the film preparation. After homogenizing, the CSt/PVA/ChS solution was poured into a Petri dish and the solvent was evaporated. All prepared films were purified using distilled water, oven-dried (50 °C for 24 h), and stored in a dissector before use or characterization."
5,Preparation of MTX-loaded films,"2.4 Preparation of MTX-loaded films Films loaded with MTX were prepared using the same protocol described in the previous section. However, specific amounts of MTX (1 or 5 w/w-% in respect to the total mass of polymers) were added to the CSt/PVA or CSt/PVA/ChS solutions before the solvent casting. Table 1 summarizes the composition of each film prepared in this study."
6,Drug content and permeation studies,"2.5 Drug content and permeation studies 2.5.1 Analytical procedures The MTX quantification was performed according to Macedo et al. (2019) validated methodology with some modifications. An LC-10A HPLC system (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an LC-20AT pump, a UV–VIS SPD-M20A detector, a CBM-20A system controller, and a SIL-20A HT valve sample automatic injector was used for the analysis. Separation was achieved at room temperature using a Gemini C18 Phenomenex column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) coupled with a C18 guard column. The isocratic mobile phase consisted of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 3.0, 15 mmol/L) and acetonitrile (85:15, v/v) run at 0.8 mL/min flow rate and MTX was detected at λ = 303 nm. The calculated limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) values were, respectively, 0.20 and 0.73 μg/mL. 2.5.2 Drug content and homogeneity of the films For MTX extraction from the films, 1.0 × 1.0 cm sections were previously cut and weighted. The film square was placed in a volumetric flask (25 mL), dispersed in 25 mL of distilled water, and kept under magnetic stirring for 20 min. For samples with 5 w/w-% MTX concentration, an aliquot of 2 mL was later diluted in 10 mL of water. For samples with 1 w/w-% MTX concentration, an aliquot of 4 mL was also diluted in 10 mL of water. The final solution was then filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane and injected into the HPLC equipment for quantification. The evaluation was performed in triplicates. The drug homogeneity in the films was assessed in 3 sections of each film lot quantified with the same methodology. 2.5.3 Permeation studies 2.5.3.1 Porcine ear skin preparation In order to perform the mucoadhesive properties and permeation studies, porcine ear skin was used and obtained from a local slaughterhouse (Avisul Ltda., Santa Maria, RS, Brazil). For each experiment, specific procedures were applied to the skin tissue, which is described in the appropriate section. The ear skin was carefully separated from adjacent tissues and cut to the appropriate sizes required for both experiments. The fragments were kept in the freezer at −18 °C until performance (Jacobi et al., 2007). 2.5.3.2 In vitro MTX permeation study The study of permeation/penetration of MTX loaded into the films was performed using vertical Franz diffusion cells and porcine ear skin as a biological barrier. The skin explants were harvested and attached carefully to the diffusion cells, with the stratum corneum facing upwards to the donor compartment. The receptor medium consisted of phosphate buffer pH 7.4, which was kept under magnetic stirring at 37 ± 0.5 °C (n = 6). Cut sections of 1.0 × 1.0 cm of the selected film samples (CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5) were applied to the skin surface and humidified with 100 µL of the buffer, corresponding to a total MTX quantity of 35.62 ± 2.76 mg to CSt/PVA-MTX5 and 38.41 ± 2.95 mg to CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5. After 12 h, the film samples were removed and the tissue and receptor media were collected. The skin was dissected into layers for MTX quantification. The stratum corneum (SC) was separated by the tape stripping technique, with 18 tapes (Flax®). The viable epidermis (VE) and dermis (DE) were separated by exposing the tissue in a water bath at 60 °C for 45 s. The water bath was also quantified for MTX residues. The compound was extracted from the skin layers with methanol (24 mL for SC, 1 mL for VE, and 2 mL for DE) followed by vortex mixing (2 min) and sonication (15 min). Each sample was filtered through a 0.45 µm cellulose membrane, injected (50 µL) into de HPLC system, and quantified by the previously described method (Section 2.2). This method was also validated to determine MTX specificity for this experiment. The specificity was tested with tape samples and pieces of full skin, which were subjected to the same experimental protocol and further analyzed in the HPLC system. No interferences in the MTX chromatogram were observed. The results were expressed as % of MTX based on the total quantity of MTX permeated in each separate skin layer and the MTX total dosage applied in the skin from the films."
7,Physicochemical characterization,"2.6 Physicochemical characterization Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with 64 scans per sample using a Shimadzu Affinity spectrometer (Japan) using the KBr pellet method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the film samples were obtained in a Sintag powder diffractometer (model XDS 2000, USA) equipped with a Ni-Filtered Cu-Ka radiation source operating at an anode voltage of 45 kV and current of 40 mA. XRD patterns were obtained in a scanning range of 5–50° with a scanning rate of 1°/min. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Shimadzu DTG-60 Analyzer (Japan) under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and temperature range of 25–500 °C."
8,In vivo studies,"2.7 In vivo studies 2.7.1 Experimental design 2.7.1.1 Mice model of Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis The experimental design for in vivo experiments is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Firstly, the animals were randomly divided into six independent groups (n = 7 animals/group) as described in Table 2 . On day 1 of the experimental protocol, the baseline right hind paw volume was measured. After that, an intraplantar injection of CFA (1 mg/mL of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in paraffin oil) was inoculated to develop a monoarticular arthritis model in mice, as previously established (Omorogbe et al., 2018). A subcutaneous injection containing 0.1 mL of CFA was administered into the right hind footpad of each mouse in all experimental groups, except the control group. Control animals (Group 1) received an injection with 0.1 mL of saline on the same local. Fourteen days after CFA immunization, animals were evaluated on pain-related behavioral tests to confirm the development of mechanical and thermal sensitivities. After behavioral tests, mice from Groups 1, 2, and 3 (control, CFA and CFA + MTX free) were orally treated with saline (10 mL/kg) or MTX at the dose of 5 mg/kg, on days 15, 18, and 21 of the experimental protocol. With the other half of the experimental groups (Groups 4 to 6), the dorsal skin of each animal was shaved, then, CSt/PVA-MTX5, CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5, and CSt/PVA films (2.0 cm height × 2.0 cm length, approximately 60 mg) were applied to this area on the same days mentioned above. To assess the efficacy of the developed film formulations, the mechanical and thermal sensitivities were also evaluated on days 18 and 21 of the experimental protocol. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment (on day 22), the animals were euthanized by inhalation of isoflurane anesthetic. The right hind footpad of each mouse was collected, and the samples were quickly frozen at −20 °C to further biochemical analyses. 2.7.2 Evaluation of pain-related behaviors 2.7.2.1 Measurement of mechanical sensitivity As reported by Alamri et al. (2018), the mechanical sensibility of the animals was estimated using an electronic aesthesiometer (Insight, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil). This apparatus consists of a device connected to a specific paw pressure transducer. First, the animals were acclimatized for 30 min in individual clear plastic chambers on an elevated wire mesh platform which allowed accessing the plantar surface of the paws. The investigator was trained to apply constant progressive pressure on the central area of the hind paw using a blunt-tipped probe connected to a transducer until paw withdrawal followed by clear flinching movements. After this response, the pressure intensity was automatically recorded. The results were expressed as the paw withdrawal threshold (g). 2.7.2.2 Measurement of thermal sensitivity Pain reflexes in response to thermal stimulus in the hot plate test were assessed in agreement with Woolfe and Macdonald’s method (Woolfe and Macdonald, 1944). Mice were individually placed on a heated metallic surface plate (52 ± 1 °C), which was surrounded by a clear acrylic cage. The time between animal placement on the apparatus and the nociceptive response event (jumping off the surface, shaking, or licking the hind paws) was recorded. To avoid any injury on animal paws, a cut-off time of 45 s was established. The results were expressed as the paw withdrawal latency (s). 2.7.3 Estimation of inflammatory parameters 2.7.3.1 Measurement of paw edema On day 22 of the experimental protocol, the animals were euthanized and both hind paws were cut at the ankle joint and weighed on the analytical balance. The paw edema was measured by the difference between right paw (CFA treatment) and left paw (vehicle treatment) and the results were expressed in mg. 2.7.3.2 Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity estimation For this assay, paw samples were homogenized in PBS (20 mmol/L, pH 7.4) containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L). Then, the homogenates were sonicated for 2 min, frozen, and thawed three times. Right after the homogenization step, the samples were centrifuged at 2,000g for 15 min in which the supernatant (S1) was collected. Next, the S1 fraction was also centrifuged at 14,000g for 30 min at 4 °C to yield a final pellet (P2) that it was resuspended in a medium containing potassium phosphate buffer (50 mmol/L, pH 6.0) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (0.5 wt/v-%) before to perform the enzymatic assay. Following the method previously described (Suzuki et al., 1983), an aliquot of resuspended P2 was added to a medium containing the resuspension buffer as well as N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylbenzidine (1.5 mmol/L). The kinetic activity of MPO was started after the addition of H2O2 (0.01 v/v-%), and the color reaction was measured spectrophotometrically at λ = 655 nm at 37 °C. The results were expressed as optic density (OD)/mg protein/min. 2.7.4 Estimation of oxidative stress markers 2.7.4.1 Tissue preparation The paw samples were homogenized (1:10 w/v) in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mmol/L) at pH 7.4. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 2,500x g for 10 min at 4 °C and the low-speed supernatant (S1) was used for biochemical analysis. The protein concentration in S1 was estimated according to the method described by Bradford (Bradford, 1976), using a bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1 mg/mL) as a standard. The color was measured spectrophotometrically at λ = 595 nm. 2.7.4.2 Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay TBARS assay was performed to indirectly determine the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, an important lipid peroxidation marker. As previously described by Ohkawa et al. (1979), MDA reacts with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) under acidic conditions and high temperatures to yield the chromogen. The S1 aliquots were incubated with TBA (0.8 w/v-%), acetic acid buffer (pH 3.4) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 8.1 w/v-%) for 2 h at 95 °C. The color reaction was measured at λ = 532 nm and the results were expressed as nmol of MDA/mg of tissue, respectively. 2.7.4.3 Non-protein thiol (NPSH) content NPSH content, a non-enzymatic antioxidant defense, was determined by Ellman’s method (Ellman, 1959). Briefly, S1 was mixed (1:1) with trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 10 v/v-%). After centrifugation (3,000x g for 10 min), an aliquot of supernatant containing free SH-groups was added in potassium phosphate buffer (1 mmol/L) pH 7.4 and 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB, 10 mmol/L). The color reaction was measured at λ = 412 nm and NPSH levels were expressed as nmol of NPSH/g tissue."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis The normality of the data was evaluated by the D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test. All analyses were performed using the GraphPad® software (San Diego, CA, USA). Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.). Post hoc test was performed only when the F-value achieved the necessary level of statistical significance (p < 0.05) and when the data were considered homogeneous"
10,Results and discussion,
11,Drug content and homogeneity of the films,"3.1 Drug content and homogeneity of the films Films are solid pharmaceutical formulations that received special attention over the last decade, mainly because of their advantages in comparison to the other dosage forms, such as physicochemical stability and multiple administration routes (Morales and McConville, 2011). The efficiency of such materials as DDS is closely related to their ability to incorporate and release drugs at specific sites. Thus, before investigating release properties it is mandatory to quantify the drug content loaded (i.e., incorporation efficiency) and its distribution through the film. As assessed, the film samples prepared with the lowest amount of MTX (CSt/PVA-MTX1 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX1) presented the highest drug content (104.5 ± 7.6% and 110.5 ± 10.2%). Although the samples CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5 had shown lower drug content (68.4 ± 1.3% and 70.4 ± 1.4%), they exhibited superior homogeneity. These results indicate that the films prepared at 1 w/w-% of MTX have drug content closer to the theoretical values compared to the films prepared at 5 w/w-%. However, the films prepared with the highest amount of MTX showed accurate content homogeneity, while the films prepared with the lowest amount did not fit the criteria. Thus, it is suggested that conditions and techniques described in the experimental section may not be adequate to obtain homogeneous MTX-loaded CSt/PVA or CSt/PVA/ChS films using 1 w/w-% of the drug. Additionally, the presence of ChS did not cause a significant difference for the values computed for the samples containing the same amount of MTX."
12,In vitro MTX permeation,"3.2 In vitro MTX permeation The permeation study was conducted to estimate the drug distribution profile in the different layers of porcine ear skin. The results showed in Fig. 2 demonstrated that both film samples (CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5) presented a similar drug profile permeation in the skin layers, which can be correlated to the homogeneity results observed in the drug content evaluation. In terms of transdermal application of pharmaceutical dosage forms, the primary challenge is to effectively deliver the drug across the skin barrier. The highest concentration of MTX was detected in the medium, suggesting that the formulation can provide a systemic absorption of the drug. For CSt/PVA-MTX5, the maximum permeation was calculated to be 62.9 ± 6.8%, while for CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5 and 58.3 ± 6.0%; however, these values were statistically equal. The percentage permeated in the different skin layers based on the total amount of MTX applied were computed as follows for CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5: 0.77% and 0.66% in the Stratum corneum, 0.64% and 0.65% in the epidermis, 1.56% and 1.27% in the dermis, and 5.46% and 4.16% in the medium, respectively. No statistical differences were obtained regarding these data (p > 0.05). Collectively, these data indicate that both formulations presented less than 10% of the total MTX loaded in the film samples permeated through the skin, suggesting that a great amount of the drug remained in the formulation. In addition, the pH of the media was selected taking the physiological pH into account, since the cutaneous administration of the films aimed at a systemic action. It is important to mention that the polymeric composition of the formulation as well as the physicochemical properties of MTX could influence the permeation profile. Although a previous study has demonstrated that the conjugation of hydrophobic drugs with ChS can improve their water-solubility, absorption, and, therefore, their bioavailability (Wang et al., 2017), herein, the presence of ChS did not exert an effect on the MTX permeation. From these preliminary characterization assays, the films CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5 were selected for further analysis and experiments."
13,Physicochemical characterization,"3.3 Physicochemical characterization FTIR analyses were utilized to characterize the chemical nature of pure MTX, the polymers (PVA, CSt, and ChS) utilized in the preparation of the film samples as well as to characterize the CSt/PVA and CSt/PVA/ChS films loaded (or not) with 5 w/w-% of MTX. The recorded spectra are shown in Fig. 3 a and b. For pure MTX characteristic bands were observed at 3396 cm−1 (OH stretching from OH groups), 2953 cm−1 (CH asymmetric stretching), 1634 cm−1, and 1541 cm−1 (CC stretching from the p-benzene ring), and 765 cm−1 (CH stretching of the p-benzene ring) (Wang et al., 2017; Rostamizadeh et al., 2018). The PVA spectrum showed typical bands at 3457 cm−1 (OH stretching from OH groups), 2936 cm−1 (CH asymmetric stretching from alkyl groups), 1708 cm−1 (CO stretching from residual acetate groups), 1441 cm−1 (CH bending), 1334 cm−1 (CH deformation), 1140 cm−1 (COH stretching), and 1097 cm−1 (CO stretching) (Costa et al., 2009). The CSt spectrum, exhibited bands at 3445 cm−1 (OH stretching from OH groups), 2927 cm−1 (CH asymmetric stretching), 1455 cm−1 (CN stretching from the N+(CH3)3 groups), and 1394 cm−1 (CH deformation from methyl groups). The bands in the 1150–900 cm−1 region are due to the COC asymmetric stretching and CO stretching of the glycosidic units of starch (Huang et al., 2013). The band around 1630 cm−1 is attributable to CO bending associated with OH groups (Basiak et al., 2017). For ChS, the spectrum exhibited bands at 3432 cm−1 (OH stretching from OH groups), 2933 cm−1 (CH asymmetric stretching), 1649 cm−1 (amide band), 1619 cm−1 (CO stretching from COOH groups), 1049 cm−1 (CO stretching and OH angular vibration coupling), and at 1238 cm−1 (SO stretching from OSO3H groups) (Fajardo et al., 2014). Bands at 1037 and 926 cm−1 are due to CO stretching and α(1 → 4) glucosidic bonding of ChS (Fajardo et al., 2014). The FTIR spectrum recorded from the film samples (Fig. 3b), exhibited predominantly the characteristic bands proceeding from PVA and CSt, the main components of these materials. The spectrum of CSt/PVA is a combination of the characteristic bands of both polymers with slight discrepancies. However, some bands associated with the –OH groups from CSt and PVA were shifted to low wavenumber regions suggesting an interaction between the polymers by H-bonding (Gularte et al., 2020). The spectrum of the film sample containing ChS (CSt/PVA/ChS) exhibited minimal changes compared to CSt/PVA. Overall, the characteristic bands of ChS occur in the same wavenumber regions as the bands of CSt and PVA suggesting the overlapping of such bands. Also, the low amount of ChS compared to the amount of CSt/PVA may also explain this result. However, the broadband associated with the O-H stretching (at 3444 cm−1) was sharpened in the CSt/PVA/ChS spectrum compared to CSt/PVA indicating a reduction of H-bonds between CSt and PVA. The anionic nature of ChS (due to its COOH and OSO3H groups) can favor electrostatic interactions with the cationic groups of CSt during the film preparation. Hence, the CSt-ChS interaction may impair the intermolecular interactions with the PVA chains. The FTIR spectra recorded from the MTX-loaded films showed to be very similar to the spectra of the pristine films; however, the appearance of shoulder-type bands around 1630 cm−1 due to CC stretching from aromatic ring indicates the presence of the drug into the structure of the films. As noticed, this band has been used by some researchers to confirm the incorporation of MTX in different delivery vehicles (dos Santos et al., 2017; Prasad et al., 2019; Rostamizadeh et al., 2018). XRD powder analyses were performed to investigate the structural ordering of MTX incorporated into the CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5 films. It is well recognized that many pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties can differ markedly for crystalline drugs like MTX (Datta and Grant, 2004; Gharebaghi et al., 2017). Overall, high crystallinity imparts issues concerning solubility, dissolution rate, stability, among others (Datta and Grant, 2004). Beyond those attributions associated with DDS outlined in the introduction section, these systems also can hinder the (re)crystallization of the drug, which is an additional advantage. As noticed from Fig. 4 , the XRD pattern of the CSt/PVA and CSt/PVA/ChS films presented crystalline peaks at 2θ ≈ 19.4°, 22.8°, and 40.6°, which are attributed to the reflection planes (101), (102) and (200) of the PVA crystalline microdomains into the polymeric matrix (Zhang et al., 2015). These microdomains are formed by the physical interaction of the PVA chains during the film preparation. This result is consistent with a previous study conducted by our group, where we verified that CSt has a predominant amorphous nature (i.e., low crystallinity) and its presence in a PVA matrix does not affect the formation of these crystalline domains (Gularte et al., 2020). Similarly, the presence of ChS, an amorphous polysaccharide (Barkat et al., 2020; Fajardo et al., 2010), did not change the structural ordering of the films. The XRD patterns for the film samples loaded with 5 w/w-% of MTX (CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5) were similar to the XRD pattern of CSt/PVA indicating that the drug was in an amorphous state in both polymer matrices. As observed in Fig. 4, the XRD pattern of free MTX exhibits several diffraction peaks along the 2θ region of 10°–30° confirming its crystalline nature (Tekko et al., 2020b). The absence of these peaks confirms that after incorporation, the MTX molecules were unable to form crystals, likely due to the interaction between the drug and the polymer matrix. Under the experimental conditions used to prepare the films, the MTX molecules are negatively charged (pKa 5.71) due to the deprotonation of their carboxylic groups (Alvarez-Figueroa et al., 2001). Hence, MTX can readily interact with the CSt, which has a positively charged nature. This suggestion is strengthened since the diffraction peaks ascribed to the crystalline microdomains of PVA are not affected by the presence of MTX. Overall, this result corroborates our previous assays that demonstrated an appreciable distribution of MTX through the film samples (i.e., homogeneity). The amorphous nature of the MTX-loaded films also aids to explain the results obtained from the permeation assays. Thermal properties of pure MTX, CSt/PVA, CSt/PVA/ChS, CSt/PVA-MTX5, and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5 films were investigated to gain insights into the chemical and structural nature of the prepared materials. For this, TGA/DTG analyses were done and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 5 a and b. The TGA/DTG curves of pure MTX were similar to those reported by Dhanka et al. (2018), where two main successive weight loss stages occur from 25 to 500 °C. The first stage is due to the loss of hydration water molecules (up to 120 °C, with a maximum at 92 °C), while the second stage (with a maximum at 258 °C) corresponds to the melting of the MTX structure. The pristine CSt/PVA films exhibited three main weight loss stages, which are due to the volatilization of moisture (from 50 to 150 °C), thermal decomposition of CSt combined with the elimination of –OH side groups of PVA (from 210 to 350 °C, with a maximum at 273 °C) and due to polyene backbone degradation of PVA (from 350 to 500 °C) (El-Zaher and Osiris, 2005). The absence of separated weight loss stages for the thermal decomposition of each polymer (CSt and PVA) indicates good compatibility between them (Gularte et al., 2020). This find corroborates the FTIR data that indicate H-bond interactions between CSt and PVA. However, these interactions are impaired by the addition of ChS in the CSt/PVA blending resulting in the decreasing of the thermal stability of the CSt/PVA/ChS film as compared to CSt/PVA. Similar to CSt/PVA, the TGA/DTG curves of CSt/PVA/ChS film also exhibited two weight loss stages. The first stage (from 25 to 150 °C) is due to the moisture volatilization and the second (with a maximum at 255 °C) combines the thermal degradation of the polysaccharides (CSt and ChS) and the –OH side groups of PVA. It is worth informing that ChS degrades around 246 °C (Fajardo et al. 2012). The presence of MTX seems to exert a slight effect on the thermal behavior of the loaded films. The main changes are related to the increase of weight loss percentage due to moisture volatilization and reduction of the maximum temperature of thermal decomposition. For CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5, the moisture volatilization (from 30 to 125 °C) resulted in weight loss of around 8% and 14%. The presence of MTX impaired the intermolecular interactions between CSt and PVA increasing their hygroscopic. This effect is pronounced by the presence of ChS that can interact with CSt via electrostatic interaction. Moreover, ChS is a hydrophilic polymer, which may contribute to moisture retention. The reduction of the CSt and PVA interactions also explains the shifting of the maximum temperature of decomposition to lower temperatures (256 °C for CSt/PVA-MTX5 and 255 °C for CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5). It is important to mention that the thermal decomposition of pure MTX and ChS generally occurs in the temperature range of 225–350 °C (Bajas et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2016). Beyond this, the DTG curves of the MTX-loaded films exhibited a small peak centered at 98 °C that according to the literature is due to the elimination of hydration water molecules linked to MTX structure (Fulias et al., 2014). Moreover, analyzing the residual weight of at 500 °C for all film samples, it is noted that the residue of CSt/PVA corresponds to around 20% of its initial weight, while for CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5 the residue corresponds to approximately 25% and 29%. Virtually, the increase of the residual weight fits the initial amounts of MTX and MTX + ChS added to the formulation of the films. Based on these data, it can be confirmed that MTX was efficiently incorporated into the polymeric matrix."
14,In vivo studies,"3.4 In vivo studies To assess the therapeutic efficacy of the prepared films, we choose one of the three main rodent models of chronic arthritis validated. Several studies have employed CFA-induced monoarthritic model to investigate features of this disease, including peripheral and central neuronal pathways (Danziger et al., 2001), inflammation-induced nociceptive behaviors, as well as novel strategies for treatment (Kargutkar and Brijesh, 2016). An intraplantar injection of CFA has been widely used to mimic the arthritis-like inflammation condition in rats (Weng et al., 2021). In mice, Chillingworth and Donaldson (2003) reported that an intradermal CFA injection also triggers a localized inflammation, which changed the nociceptive behavior of mice like an arthritic reaction. As shown in Fig. 6 , the animals exhibited similar baseline paw withdrawal threshold among the experimental groups on day 0 (F (5, 36) = 2.09, p > 0.05). Following 15 days, mice exposed to CFA showed a reduction of 53% in the paw withdrawal threshold when compared with the control group, characterizing a mechanical hypersensitivity (F (5, 36) = 75.05, p < 0.0001). On day 21 of the experimental protocol, the treatment with CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5 films decreased the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by CFA in mice (F (5, 36) = 21.73, p < 0.01), with a similar maximum inhibition of 69%. As expected, the treatment with MTX free, used as a positive control in this study, reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity (67%) in CFA-treated mice (p < 0.01). Moreover, the experiment demonstrated that the CSt/PVA film treatment was ineffective to increase the paw withdrawal threshold in CFA-treated mice. Similarly, Fig. 7 depicts the response to thermal stimulus in mice. On day 0, there was no significant difference in the baseline paw withdrawal latency among the experimental groups (F (5, 36) = 1.77, p > 0.05). However, after 15 days, the CFA administration decreased around 57% the paw withdrawal latency, an index of thermal hypersensitivity, when compared with the control group (F (5, 36) = 3.77, p < 0.01). A short treatment with MTX free or CSt/PVA-MTX5 and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX5 films restored the thermal hypersensitivity in CFA-treated mice (F (5, 36) = 6.46, p < 0.001), with maximum inhibition of 69%, 68%, and 67%, respectively. Again, the CSt/PVA film treatment did not alter the paw withdrawal latency compared to CFA-treated mice. In agreement with the studies mentioned above, our data demonstrated that the CFA inoculation in mice alters their nociceptive responses, as evidenced by an enhancement in the mechanical and thermal sensitivities. Interestingly, all MTX-loaded films reduced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities in CFA-treated mice, indicating an antinociceptive effect. Such data suggest that the CSt/PVA-MTX5, CSt/PVA-ChS-MTX5 films were as effective as MTX free (positive control) against RA-like disturbances/symptoms. However, the addition of ChS did not exert a noticeable effect on the CFA-treated mice compared to the film without it. We raised two possible hypotheses to explain such results: (i) The amount of ChS added to the CSt/PVA matrix is insufficient to promote perceptive results or (ii) the topical application of ChS entrapped in a polymeric matrix impairs its release to the target region. Beyond causing mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities, it is well established that CFA also induces chronic inflammatory pain like RA. CFA promotes the release of several inflammatory mediators, which could lead to the sensitization of the nociceptive neurons, characterized by a reduced pain threshold. In this line, the edema formation, evidenced by an increase in the paw volume, represents a hallmark of inflammatory response in CFA-induced arthritis (Kumar et al., 2020). Moreover, MPO, an enzyme present in the granules of leukocytes, mainly neutrophils, and macrophages, mediates the infiltration of these cells on the local injury and is responsible for secreting hypochlorite. For this reason, MPO has been considered an inflammatory response marker and might be related to the pathogenesis of RA (Strzepa et al., 2017). Herein, the results of the in vivo study demonstrated an increase around 20.2 times in the paw volume (F (5, 36) = 14.83, p < 0.0001), whereas the MPO activity enhanced 2.5 times (F (5, 35) = 6.15, p < 0.001) in mice exposed to CFA (Fig. 8 a and b). Surprisingly, short treatments with the film samples (loaded or not the drug) as well as with MTX free attenuated the edema formation (p < 0.01) and restored the MPO activity (p < 0.01) in the paw of CFA-treated mice. Such findings lead us to believe that CSt/PVA-based films (i.e., with or without MTX) reduced the inflammatory process on the local injury, but the incorporation of MTX into the CSt/PVA or CSt/PVA/ChS-films exerted an anti-arthritic effect similar to MTX free (positive control) because it was able to attenuate not only the inflammatory parameters (paw volume and MPO activity) but also the nociceptive behaviors in CFA-treated mice. It is well known that oxidative stress contributes to triggering the inflammatory process in the physiopathology of RA which this relationship is inter-dependent. Indeed, previous studies have been shown that high levels of oxidative stress and inflammation are positively correlated with the severity of symptoms in patients affected by RA (Quiñonez-Flores et al., 2016; Stamp et al., 2012). Also, the oxidative stress biomarkers are modified in the extra-articular tissues of animal models of RA (Liu et al., 2017). According to Fig. 9 a and b, our results demonstrated an enhancement in the TBARS levels (F (5, 36) = 5.25, p > 0.001), whereas the non-enzymatic antioxidant defense (NPSH) was not altered in the paw tissue of CFA exposed mice (F (5, 36) = 0.95, p > 0.05). Besides, short treatments with all prepared films (with and without MTX) as well as with MTX free did not change the levels of NPSH (p > 0.05), but they were able to reduce TBARS levels when compared with the CFA group (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that both CSt/PVA-based films and MTX reduced the degree of oxidative stress in the paw tissue of CFA-treated mice. Previous studies have implicated the stimulation of neutrophils and monocytes on lipid peroxidation (Spickett et al., 2000). The enzyme MPO catalyzes the reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and chloride which leads to the generation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). At high concentrations, this strong oxidizing and chlorinating species (HOCl) rapidly attacks the lipid molecules present in the plasma membrane of cells, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol, to trigger further lipid peroxidation (Panasenko, 1997). Moreover, Carlin and Djursäter (1988) reported that an increase in the MPO activity might be related to an enhancement in the TBARS levels, an index of lipid peroxidation. Based on this, our results reinforce the hypothesis that the exacerbated activity of MPO in RA could damage the lipid molecules, as evidenced by an increase in TBARS levels on the local injury. Moreover, a disturbance in the MPO activity has been involved in the production of free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which suggest that this enzyme contributes to the pathogenesis of RA. On the other hand, short treatment with MTX (loaded or not into the films) diminished neutrophil infiltration and the inflammatory response, as evidenced by a reduction in the MPO activity and paw volume in CFA-treated mice. Consequently, MTX reduces TBARS levels that might lead to a decrease in the oxidation of membrane lipids of chondrocytes and fibrocytes (Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2015). Also, MTX reduced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in mice exposed to CFA by modulating biochemical parameters. Although MTX is considered the first-line agent for RA treatment, orally administered MTX exhibited a variable intestinal absorption and a poor pharmacokinetic profile, which directly interferes with drug bioavailability, plasmatic half-time, and clinical efficacy (Visser and van der Heijde, 2009). In addition, oral formulations are associated with gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucosal ulceration, and stomatitis (Rohr et al., 2017). Into this context, the MTX-loaded into a transdermal DDS raises as an attractive and efficient alternative, because it can avoid the gastrointestinal tract and the non-linear pharmacokinetics which in turn, reduces the side effects related to MTX administration by the oral route (Prasad and Koul, 2012). Previous studies reported that MTX-loaded into a gel or hydrogel, as transdermal delivery systems, showed the same or better efficacy when compared to MTX-free in animal models of RA (Qindeel et al., 2020). In addition, Zeb et al. (2017) incorporated the MTX-entrapped ultradeformable liposome (MTX-UDLs) into a gel for skin application which suppressed cytokines expression and neutrophil accumulation in the joints of CFA-treated rats. In another study, Sadarani et al. (2019) developed a transdermal MTX nanogel that effectively inhibited the progression of collagen-induced arthritis in rats. Qindeel et al. (2020) prepared a hydrogel of MTX-loaded nanomicelles that improved both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of MTX free. Consistent with those findings, the current study also demonstrates that CSt/PVA or CSt/PVA/ChS films could deliver MTX through the transdermal route to inflamed tissue of CFA-induced arthritis in mice. Therefore, the application of the CSt/PVA-based films loaded with MTX on the dorsal skin of the animals on days 15, 18, and 21 of the experimental protocol was as effective as MTX free (positive control) in modulating some characteristic signs of CFA-induced arthritis in mice, including inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and nociceptive behaviors. As an advantage, MTX transdermal delivery using CSt/PVA-based films might be considered a novel patient-friendly therapy to RA because it could overcome the limited pharmacokinetic properties of MTX."
15,Conclusions,"In this study, we demonstrated the successful preparation of polymeric films of CSt/PVA and CSt/PVA/ChS for association and MTX delivery. The film samples prepared with 5 w/w-% of MTX exhibited a better drug distribution into the polymer matrix, high drug loading was achieved (>68.4%) and permeated all skin layers. All films (with and without MTX) were fully characterized by FTIR, XRD, and TGA analyses. In vivo studies using a CFA-induced arthritis model in mice showed that the CSt/PVA-based films loaded with 5 w/w-% of MTX applied topically exhibited performance comparable to the free MTX (positive control), which was orally administered. Of particular importance, MTX reaches maximum plasma concentration within 0.75 to 2 h after conventional administration route (oral) which often leads to nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and stomatitis, affecting drug bioavailability and clinical efficacy. As an advantage, the transdermal mode of the films, a short diffusive pathway to permeate vasculature, may help overcome issues and adverse effects due to digestion and metabolism of MTX in the gastrointestinal tract. Besides, under the experimental conditions utilized in this study the addition of ChS in the film composition did not cause a noticeable effect on the investigated biological parameters. Therefore, as future perspectives, we would like to investigate a long-term treatment with CSt/PVA-MTX and CSt/PVA/ChS-MTX films in this arthritis model in order to evaluate pharmacological e and toxicological properties."
