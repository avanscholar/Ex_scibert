0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is pointed out as the most promising energy vector for the future, being the focus of many types of research around the world. The high production costs associated with the use of fossil sources are considered the main barriers to the development of the hydrogen economy. In this scenario, photocatalytic systems using seawater and sunlight to generate hydrogen from photocleavage of the water molecule is an alternative process based on endless energy sources that can be added to other strategies to solve global sustainability issues. Seawater is a natural electrolytic solution with a composition of 56% Cl-, 28% Na+ and other minority components, abundantly available, that can be applied in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Previous studies have already shown that the use of a solution containing sodium chloride improves the photocatalytic production of hydrogen because the electrolytes aid the charge transport in the solid/solution interface [1–7]. Until the present moment, few studies are focusing on the production of hydrogen from natural seawater, especially using narrowband photocatalysts that absorb visible light, the main component of the sunlight [6–15]. In this way, the current challenge is the development of narrow bandgap semiconductors capable to drive the water splitting under visible light irradiation that are also stable in an electrolytic medium. Metal semiconductors based on elements from groups 12 and 16 of the Periodic Table have attracted special attention, including the chalcogenides CdS, CdSe, and CdTe, due to narrow bandgap, high absorption coefficient and easy preparation [16–22]. However, suitable band potentials to drive the water-splitting, as well as high chemical and photochemical stability, are also required. Cadmium sulfide is one of the most active photocatalysts for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation but it is toxic and prone to photocorrosion, which limits its application [2,23]. In attempts to minimize such effects, some cadmium atoms were exchanged to zinc in the crystalline structure combined with adjustments of pH, salinity, and concentration of the sacrificial reagent, that reached improvements in hydrogen production [1,2,10,24]. In this way, the present work focus on the development of narrowband photocatalysts based on pure metal chalcogenides (CdSe and ZnSe) and solid solutions type CdxZn(1-x)SySe(1-y) aiming to improve the stability in aqueous solution and make them more environmentally friendly. Unlike the usual procedure for synthesizing chalcogenide quantum dots [25,26], the nanocrystals in here were synthesized at room temperature throughout the entire process and the solution pH was adjusted to 12 before reducing the chalcogen by tetrahydroborate. Under alkaline conditions the reducing power of BH4- increases (equations 1 and 2) and the alkaline medium stabilizes the chalcogenides in solution, preventing the formation of toxic gases such as H2Se or H2S. The metal selenides and sulfoselenides formed after metal cations addition are poorly soluble and thermodynamically stable under these conditions. (1) BH4 -(aq) + 8OH–(aq) → H2BO3 -(aq) + 5H2O(l) + 8e- (E = 1.24V) (2) BH4 -(aq) + 3H2O(aq) → B(OH)3 + 7H+ + 8e- (E = 0.48V) The materials prepared by the proposed method were evaluated in visible-light-induced hydrogen production from natural seawater collected at Barra beach, located in Salvador-Bahia, Brazil (13°00'37.2""S 38°31'57.0""W), and lactic acid as a sacrificial reactant. Lactic acid is a mixed-function carboxylic acid-alcohol compound and its oxidation can lead to the formation of a carboxylic acid-ketone compound. Zhang et al. [27] studied the photooxidation of lactic acid and showed that, even after 24 hours of irradiation, there was no noticeable change in the concentration of the carboxyl group (-COOH) and pyruvic acid was the main product found in solution."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chemicals used in the synthesis and photocatalytic tests were of analytical grade, and all of them were used as purchased. Sodium thiosulfate (99%) and 80% L(+)-lactic acid and 8 wt.% hexachloroplatinic acid hexahydrate solutions were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Sodium tetrahydroborate (PA) was purchased from Neon, while cadmium chloride monohydrate and zinc nitrate hexahydrate were purchased from Merck."
3,Synthesis of selenides and sulfoselenides,"2.2 Synthesis of selenides and sulfoselenides Metal chalcogenide nanoparticles were synthesized by coprecipitation method in a closed reactor under an argon atmosphere, at room temperature. The stoichiometric molar ratio was used for synthesizing pure metal chalcogenides (CdSe, ZnSe), while molar ratios 1:1:1 and 1:1:1:1 were used for ternary (CdZnSe1 and CdSSe) and quaternary (CdZnSSe1) samples, respectively. Two samples were prepared with an excess of zinc (CdZnSe8 and CdZnSSe8) in molar ratios 1:8:1 and 1:8:1:1, respectively, to guarantee the metal incorporation and evaluate its influence in the matrix structure. The synthesis process took place in two steps; the first one consisted of the chalcogen reduction (S2O3 2-/S2- and SeO3 2-/Se2-) by NaBH4 and the second one the addition of metal cation (Cd2+ and/or Zn2+) solution to precipitate the nanoparticles. For CdSe synthesis, 50 mL of deionized water were added to the reactor and pH was adjusted to 12 with 1 mL of 1.0 mol L-1 NaOH. Then, 16 mmol NaBH4 (Neon, PA) and 5.30 mmol Na2SeO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were dissolved in the start alkaline solution (molar ratio Se2+:BH4 - of 1:3). The reactor was closed and an argon flow was passed through the solution for one hour, at room temperature. After this period, the colorless solution changes to dark brown. Another solution was prepared by dissolving 5.30 mmol CdCl2.5H2O (Merck, 98%) in 5 mL of deionized water. This solution was added into the reactor through a septum using a syringe. The precipitation of CdSe occurs immediately after mixing the two solutions. The system remained under argon flow during one more hour for crystal maturation. The reactor content was centrifuged at 3 × 103 rpm for 8 minutes. The dark brown solid was rinsed two times with deionized water and two times with absolute ethanol (PA). The solid was dried at room temperature for 24 hours. All of the other materials were synthesized following the same procedure described above using appropriated amounts of the respective reactants."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Synthesized materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (Shimadzu XRD6000) with scanning rate 2° 2θ min-1, in the range 2θ of 5-80°, using CuK〈, Ni-filtered radiation, at 35 kV and 15 mA. Diffuse reflectance spectra in the UV/vis region were recorded on a spectrometer Shimadzu 2450 UV/vis. The chemical composition of the bulk was determined by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence in equipment Shimadzu EDX720 in QualiQuant mode, Na-Sc and Ti-U scan, 10 mm collimator, under vacuum atmosphere with molybdenum filter to avoid interference. SEM images were taken in JSM-6610LV scanning electron microscopy (JEOL) operated at 20 kV after gold metallization in a metalized DEWTON VACUUM DESKV as well chemical composition of the surface. TEM images were taken in Libra120 Carl Zeiss by thermionic emission with LaB6 filament and Olympus Imaging System (Cantega G2 camera and iTEM software). The BET surface areas and average pore diameters and sizes were calculated from the treatment of N2 adsorption isotherms collected at 77 K after vacuum pretreating the samples at 323 K for 12 h in a Micromeritics ASAP2020 automated sorptometer."
5,Zero-point charge (pHzpc),"2.4 Zero-point charge (pHzpc) The zero point charge (pHzpc) and the ideal pH for the photocatalytic reaction were determined by the adsorption method using four selected samples (CdSe, CdSSe, CdZnSe8 e CdZnSSe8) in natural seawater according to the procedure described elsewhere [1]."
6,Photocatalytic activity,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity A high-pressure 500 W Hg-Xe arc lamp was used as a light source for the photocatalytic reactions. The collimated light beam was passed through an IR filter and a 420 nm cut-off filter before reaching the flat window of the photocatalytic cell (total volume =170 mL) that was maintained at a constant temperature by air cooling. The photocatalytic cell was equipped with argon gas inlet/outlet tubes to collect and transfer gaseous products to the analytical system. Hydrogen gas evolution was measured by gas chromatography (SHIMADZU, GC2014) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and argon as the carrier gas. Gas-phase was injected in the GC system by a gas pump (SCHARZER, model PN SP625EC). To quantify the hydrogen produced during the reaction, a 5% H2 standard diluted in argon was injected before each experiment. For each photocatalytic test, 120 mg of a given photocatalyst were dispersed in 60 mL of 50% (V/V) L(+)-lactic acid in seawater as collected containing 60 μL of 8% wt. H2[PtCl6].6H2O. Then, the final solution pH was adjusted to 3 with NaOH and the photocatalytic cell was purged with argon for 40 min before irradiation to eliminate oxygen gas. Aliquots of 1 mL of the gas phase were injected in the GC system in intervals of 1 h. To quantify the hydrogen produced during the reaction, a 5% H2 standard diluted in argon was injected before each experiment."
7,Results and discussion,"The identification of the crystal phases was carried out by comparing the X-ray diffraction patterns of the materials with the individual phase patterns provided by ICSD (Inorganic Crystal Structure Database). The X-ray diffraction patterns of the selenide and sulfoselenide samples are shown in Fig. 1 , as well as the patterns of the individual chalcogenide phases from ICSD. Cadmium selenide, the matrix of all materials synthesized, presents an X-ray diffraction pattern with wide peaks at 25.6º, 42.2º, and 49.7º (2θ), corresponding to the crystalline planes (111), (220) and (311) of the cubic CdSe (ICSD #41528). Such peaks are not well resolved, probably due to the small size of crystallites; however, no additional peaks were detected, which suggests the formation of CdSe pure phase. In the same way, the ZnSe sample shows wide diffraction peaks at 27.6º, 45.5º, and 53.9º (2θ), which are compliant with the ICSD standard for cubic ZnSe (ICSD #77091), and also no segregated phase was detected. The X-ray diffraction patterns for two ternary samples, CdZnSe1 and CdZnSe8, showed wide peaks in the range of 23° - 30° and 40° - 55° (2θ) compatible with the matrix cubic phase. Due to the different sizes of Zn and Cd, zinc incorporation in the CdSe matrix causes a shift in the diffraction peaks. The position of the main peak for CdZnSe1 sample, centered between the peaks of the CdSe (ICSD #41528) and ZnSe (ICSD #77091) standards, suggests the formation of sphalerite type crystals where both Cd2+ and Zn2+ occupy the center of tetrahedron sites, while Se2- occupy the corners and faces [28]. Since the cadmium ion radius (103 pm) is larger than the zinc ion radius (83 pm), the partial replacement of Cd2+ by Zn2+ in the CdSe matrix promotes a decrease in the interplanar distances, which implies an increase in diffraction angles θ, according to Bragg equation (λ = 2dsinθ), as observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns of these samples. In contrast, no peak shift for sample CdZnSe8 was observed and several other peaks of segregated phases have appeared, indicating that the addition of an excess of zinc in CdZnSe8 preparation lead to the priority formation of other phases containing zinc, which means that no effective replacement of Cd by Zn in the CdSe matrix takes place. In theory, replacement occurs easily when the difference between the exchanged atoms does not exceed 15% [29]. In the case of cadmium and zinc, this difference is about 24%, which may result in preferential formation of segregated phases instead of isomorphic cationic replacement. Among segregated phases in sample CdZnSe8, we can highlight zinc hydroxychloride (Zn5(OH)8Cl2.H2O), a lamellar hydroxy salt (LHS) capable of modifying the properties of molecules and charged species present in the interlayer space, already reported in the literature as good support for charge exchange [30]. Besides, it is possible replacing some zinc atoms by cadmium in the LHS structure, yielding a compound with a typical empirical formula [M+2 1-yMe+2 y)(OH)2-x]x+(An-)x/n.zH2O, where M2+ and Me2+ represent two divalent metals [30]. In the same way, the position of the peaks for ternary sample CdSSe is located between the peaks of the CdSe (ICSD #41528) and CdS (ICSD #252373) standards in the cubic phase. A peak shift to larger angles (from 25,6° to 26,6° 2θ) is also observed due to partial anionic replacement of Se2- by S2- in the CdSe matrix because the sulfide ion radius (184 pm) is less than the selenide ion radius (198 pm). In this case, it is possible to form an unlimited substitutional solid solution like CdSySe(1-y), since the difference between the radius of Se2- and S2- is only 7% [28,31]. Quaternary samples, CdZnSSe1 and CdZnSSe8 show XRD patterns with wide peaks in range 23° – 30° and 40° – 45° 2θ, but only the former shows peaks shift compatible with solid solution formation like Cd(1-x)ZnxSySe(1-y). Similarly to the ternary sample CdZnSe8, the quaternary sample CdZnSSe8 prepared with an excess of zinc shows several segregated phases, such as Zn5(OH)8Cl2.H2O and Zn(OH)Cl, and no peak shift concerning CdSe phase is observed, which suggests that no solid solution has been formed. The average diameters of the crystallites were calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation (3) from the XRD data for the crystallographic plane (111). (3) D = k λ β cos θ where λ is the X-ray wavelength of 1.541 Å, k is a crystal shape-dependent constant (0.89 for spherical crystals), θ is the Bragg diffraction angle and ® is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 2θ. ® values were taken with Gaussian fitting of the data scattering graphic from 21° to 30° (2θ), the best-resolved peak of CdSe (2θ = 25.53º), and from 24º to 31º, the best-resolved peak of ZnSe (2θ = 27.56º). The average crystallite sizes calculated for CdSe and ZnSe were 3.25 nm and 4.92 nm, respectively. The other samples did not show well-resolved peaks that could be used for calculations. Table 1 shows the elemental composition found in the selenide and sulfoselenide samples by EDX from superficial and bulk analyses. In general, the elemental compositions on the surface and in the bulk are close but the contents of each element in the bulk are higher than on the surface, except in the case of sulfur. The zinc contents in the bulk of the samples CdZnSe1 and CdZnSSe1 were 24.37% and 25.35%, respectively. In both samples, XRD data suggest the formation of substitutional solid solutions. It is in agreement with our previous work, where we found maximum zinc incorporation of 24.3% in the CdZnS solid solution [2]. Considering 24% the limit of zinc incorporation, the approximate empirical formula for solid solutions is compatible with Cd0.5Zn0.5Se for the CdZnSe1 sample and Cd0.5Zn0.5S0.1Se0.9 for CdZnSSe1 sample. For samples prepared with an excess of zinc, CdZnSe8 and CdZnSSe8, the zinc contents in the bulk were 49.47% and 52.75%, respectively. In these cases, zinc is not incorporated in the CdSe structure but it is present as segregated phases, as shown in XRD analysis. It is noted that the most compounds obtained are non-stoichiometric with selenium vacancies in selenides and selenium/sulfur vacancies in sulfoselenides. It is evident in the CdSSe sample that we expected an unlimited substitutional solid solution based on XRD and in the similarity of the selenium and sulfur radius, but only 1.89% of sulfur was incorporated. The UV-vis absorption spectra displayed in Fig. 2 a reveal a wide absorption range for all selenide and sulfoselenide samples. The CdSe matrix shows the absorption edge at wavelengths in the visible range with an onset around 700 nm, which is a characteristic of the bulk CdSe [32]. An additional absorption peak around 508 nm was also observed, which is compatible with the expected absorption for CdSe nanoparticles in the size range from 1 to 5 nm according to the literature [26,32–35] The presence of two absorption structures for CdSe with different size distributions has also been reported by Dey et al. (2015) [36]. On the other hand, the ZnSe spectrum has two absorption structures in shorter wavelengths around 390 nm and 440 nm that are compatible with the intrinsic transitions of the bandgap in ZnSe nanoparticle and ZnSe bulk, respectively [37]. The absorption edge around 700 nm in the ZnSe spectrum can be attributed to defective energy levels as reported by Tian et al. (2019) [38]. A discrete and gradual blue-shift is observed between 680 nm and 700 nm for samples containing zinc (CdZnSe1, CdZnSe8, CdZnSSe1 e CdZnSSe8) when compared to samples without zinc (CdSe and CdSSe). For solid solutions, the position of the valence band edge does not change with Zn incorporation, whose major contribution is from Se4p orbitals. In contrast, the conduction band energy increases and the band potential becomes more negative, which will lead to a widening in the bandgap of the solid solutions with zinc [20,39]. The bandgap energies (Table 2 ) were determined by applying the geometric method assuming direct band transitions, as illustrated in Fig. 2b. The values were determined from equation Ihv = A(hv – Eg)1/2 , where I is the absorption intensity, A is a coefficient, and hv is the photon energy. [40]. The Eg values found for CdSe were 1.81 eV and 2.32 eV. The literature reported values between 1.74 and 1.8 eV for CdSe nanoparticles larger than 5 nm and 2.2 - 2.5 eV for nanoparticles up to 5 nm (quantum dots) [33,41,42], which indicates that CdSe prepared in this work has a wide distribution of crystallite size. The bandgap values found for ZnSe were 2.34 eV and 2.86 eV for different particle sizes, while the value reported in the literature for ZnSe bulk is 2.7 eV [27,38]. Semiconductor particles with dimensions below a critical radius of approximately 10 nm have special optical and electrical properties due to quantum confinement effect [32]. The radius of the quantum-sized nanoparticles can be calculated from the absorbance data obtained by UV-vis spectra using the Brus Equation (4) [43–45]: (4) E g n a n o = E g b u l k + ћ 2 π 2 2 r 2 1 m e * + 1 m h * - 1.8 e 2 4 π ε ε 0 r where E g n a n o and E g b u l k are the bandgap energies of nanoparticles and bulk, respectively, found from absorbance data applying the geometric method (Table 2); ћ is the Planck constant (1.05457 × 10-34 J s; ћ = h/2π), e is the electron charge (1.602 × 10-19 C), me* and mh* are the effective mass of the excited electron and hole, respectively, ε and ε0 are the dielectric permittivities of the semiconductor and the vacuum (ε0 = 8.854 × 10-12 C2 N-1 m-2), respectively, and r is the nanoparticle radius. The second term of the equation is related to the confinement energy of the electron-hole pair at a spherical quantum point and the last term is the electron-hole coulombic-attraction energy [46,47]. The parameter values for the cubic CdSe and ZnSe are: me* = 0,13m0 e 0,157m0 , mh*= 0,45m0 e 0,935m0 , ε = 10.6 e 8.7, respectively [44,45], where m0 is the electron mass (9.110 × 10-31 kg). For samples containing both cadmium and zinc, the parameters were the same used for CdSe. The results are shown in Table 2 in which it is possible to observe an increase in the bandgap energies of the nanoparticles ( E g n a n o ) when compared to those of the bulk ( E g b u l k ) that can be attributed to the confinement effect of quantum-sized particles [32]. The diameters (D = 2 r) found are below 5 nm, except for ZnSe that was 6.57 nm. Values obtained from the Brus equation for CdSe and ZnSe are larger than those calculated from XRD data using the Debye-Scherrer equation CdSe and ZnSe. Nevertheless, these different results are in accordance with the broad distribution of particle sizes observed in TEM images (Fig. 3 : a, c, d, g, i, j and l) and confirmed by histograms of the particle size distribution (Fig. 3: b, e, and h). The histograms of CdSe, ZnSe, and CdSSe were obtained through the statistical treatment of five TEM images for each sample using ImageJ program. CdSe, ZnSe, and CdSSe have a wide particle size distribution with an average of 6.97 nm, 6.24 nm, and 6.4 nm, respectively. There is a large number of particles with diameters between 4-6 nm, which is in accordance with results obtained by the Brus equation. In this way, the increase in particle size was probably caused by the Ostwald maturation process [48], in which the smaller particles are dissolved again and their solvated species re-precipitate over the larger particles, thus increasing the size distribution and decreasing the total particle count. For other samples, it was not possible to calculate the size of the nanocrystallites due to dense agglomeration. Typical electron diffraction patterns for the selected area (SAED) are depicted in Fig. 3 (c, f, i and k) with the presence of three diffuse rings corresponding to (111), (220) and (311) crystallographic planes of sphalerite structure, one more evidence of the cubic crystalline phase found in the XRD patterns previously discussed. Textural properties such as surface area, volume, and pore sizes determined by the BET method are shown in Table 3 . The CdSSe sample has the highest surface area (SBET 117.08 m2 g-1) followed by CdSe (SBET 115.44 m2 g-1). These two samples also have the larger pore volumes, 0.505 cm3 g-1 and 0.437 cm3 g-1, respectively, and all samples present pore diameter in the range of mesopores. The textural analysis revealed that zinc incorporation promotes a decrease in the surface area and in the pore volume of the selenides samples, similar to the solid solution ZnCdS previously studied [2]. In contrast, zinc incorporation causes an increase in pore diameters. It can be a consequence of more cohesive agglomerations of nanoparticles showed in SEM images (Fig. 4 ). The SEM images confirm the formation of CdSe nanoparticles with spherical shape as reported in the literature [49]. The morphological aspect of the ZnSe and samples containing zinc shows cohesive agglomerates with irregular morphology and different sizes, especially for samples with high zinc content, such samples (CdZnSe8 and CdZnSSe8). These samples have shown plates compatible with the presence of zinc hydroxychloride (Zn5(OH)8Cl2.H2O) as a segregated phase [50,51], identified in the XRD analysis (Fig. 1). The study of surface chemistry was carried out by the adsorption method on the hydrated CdSe matrix sample in natural seawater without any previous treatment (NaCl 0.67 mol L-1) to find the ideal pH for maximum hydrogen production. The same method was applied to the samples containing sulfur (CdSSe), zinc (CdZnSe8) and both sulfur and zinc (CdZnSSe8) to evaluate the influence of these elements (S and Zn) on the surface functional groups in the range of pH 1 – 12 (Fig. 5 ). The zero point charge (pHzpc) for hydrated CdSe was found to be 8.4, obtained by the intersection on the x-axis (initial pH) in Fig. 5. In the pH range of 2-3, hydrated CdSe concentrates the maximum positive charge as a consequence of surface protonation, while above pHzpc no negative charges were developed on the surface since there was no virtually pH variation. A similar profile was observed for the CdSSe sample, indicating that sulfur does not modify the nature of functional groups on the surface. On the other hand, samples containing zinc, CdZnSe8 and CdZnSSe8, have shown a decrease in pHzpc to 6.5 as well a decrease in the concentration of positive charge on the surface evidenced by the lower ⊗pH in the pH range of 2-3. The segregated phases containing zinc hydroxide and zinc hydroxichloride identified in the XRD patterns in both samples contribute to increase the surface hydroxyl groups, which implies in an increase in surface acidity of CdZnSe8 and CdZnSSe8 compared to CdSe matrix and also favors the development of negative surface charges in the basic pH range. These results demonstrate that the surface chemistry of these samples is strongly influenced by zinc presence. In preliminary photocatalytic tests to define the best reaction conditions in natural seawater, CdSe was used as a model photocatalyst and three different initial concentrations of lactic acid were tested at pH 3 (pH condition in which there is the highest concentration of positive charges on the surface). One can see in Fig. 6 a that the production of H2 increases initially with the increase of lactic acid concentration, reaching the maximum hydrogen production (156.8 μmol g-1 h-1) when the concentration is 50% (v/v); however, the hydrogen production rate decreases with increasing lactic acid concentration to 70% (v/v). Thus, the initial concentration of lactic acid was fixed in 50% (v/v) for all other photocatalytic tests. Kinetic curves and hydrogen production rates of selenide and sulfoselenide samples (Figs. 6b and 6c) using natural seawater and 50% lactic acid at pH 3 reveal that all samples are photoactive under visible-light irradiation as expected since they are narrow bandgap semiconductors (Eg < 3.0 eV). Photocatalysts with both cadmium and zinc in their compositions (CdZnSe1, CdZnSe8, CdZnSSe1, and CdZnSSe8) were more photoactive for hydrogen production than pure selenides (CdSe and ZnSe). Among the more active photocatalysts, the quaternary samples CdZnSSe1 and CdZnSSe8 were the ones that performed better. It is evidence of the positive effect of both sulfur and zinc in materials composition. While CdZnSSe1 has XRD patterns compatible with a solid solution like Cd(1-x)ZnxSySe(1-y), CdZnSSe8 prepared with an excess of zinc have shown several segregated phases of zinc, such as Zn5(OH)8Cl2.H2O, ε-Zn(OH)2 and Zn(OH)Cl. Despite the lowest surface area among all evaluated photocatalysts, CdZnSSe8 has shown the highest hydrogen production rate. It must be associated with zinc segregated phases present in this sample, as Zn5(OH)8Cl2.H2O, considered an efficient wide-bandgap semiconductor in the photoelectrode associated with CdS quantum dots in photoelectrochemical cells and good support for charge exchange [30,50]. The increase in photoactivity of this system was attributed to the higher recombination resistance and longer electron lifetime [50]. Species such as ZnO and Zn(OH)2 associated with solid solutions like Cd(1-x)ZnxS also have performed high photoactivity [2,24]. Once identified the best performance photocatalyst (CdZnSSe8), a photocatalytic test with lactic acid in deionized water was performed and the photoactivity was compared to the system containing natural seawater at the same pH. The hydrogen production rate with deionized water was 341.7 μmol gcat -1 h-1 (Fig. 6c), 16% less than that obtained using natural seawater (395.1 μmol gcat -1 h-1), which means that the presence of electrolytes in seawater contributes to increase photocatalytic activity. Besides, the long-term reaction was carried out to assess the stability of CdZnSSe8 compared to pure CdSe under the same reaction conditions tested previously, 50% (v/v) lactic acid in seawater at pH 3 (Fig. 6d). The profile of the kinetic curves shows an increasing hydrogen production, without loss of activity until the period of 20 hours for sample CdSe and 30 hours for sample CdZnSSe8. These results show that the presence of both sulfur and zinc in the material increases the stability of the photocatalyst in aqueous media."
8,Conclusions,"A mild synthesis method was successfully applied to prepare ternary (Cd0.5Zn0.5Se, named CdZnSe1) and quaternary (Cd0.5Zn0.5S0.1Se0.9, named CdZnSSe1) solid solutions when stoichiometric ratios of cadmium and zinc are used. However, when an excess of zinc is used, segregated phases are formed instead of incorporation into the CdSe spharelite structure. Selenides and sulfoselenides nanoparticles obtained have a wide particle-size distribution with an average of 6 – 7 nm. All materials are photosensitive to visible light and photoactive in hydrogen production from seawater when irradiated (⌊ > 420 nm). The presence of zinc and sulfur both incorporated in the sphalerite structure and in segregated phases contributed to increase the photocatalytic activity, with emphasis on the photocatalysts CdZnSSe1 and CdZnSSe8. The latter was the most active photocatalyst and is a mixture of CdSe and zinc segregated phases, such as Zn5(OH)8Cl2.H2O, Zn(OH)Cl and Zn(OH)2, which contributed to improve the rate of hydrogen production and stability in aqueous media."
