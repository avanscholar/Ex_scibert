0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde, such as the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, is an important transformation in organic chemistry [1]. Aldehydes are widely used as intermediates for the production of cosmetics, perfumes, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Traditional oxidants such as chromate and permanganate are aggressive reagents that can damage to laboratory equipment through corrosion, as well as having a considerable environmental impact. As part of the growing tendency towards green chemistry, current research in this area has focused on the development of the environmentally benign catalytic processes involving the use molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant [2]. Work towards the use of H2O2-assisted processes, in particular, has attracted considerable interest because this oxidant is readily available, provides a high active oxygen content and generates water as its sole byproduct [3]. A wide variety of catalytic systems have been developed for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, including metal oxides [4], metal complexes [5], molecular sieves [6] and polyoxometalates (POMs) [7]. Specially, there are many reports on tungsten-based catalytic systems for oxidation of alcohols (or olefins) with hydrogen peroxide [8–14]. These tungsten-based catalytic systems for oxidation of alcohols (or olefins) with hydrogen peroxide showed high catalytic activity, selectivity and high efficiency of H2O2 utilization. On the other hand, in the reported papers, some of the oxidation reactions were carried out under the conditions of adding organic solvents (such as acetonitrile, benzene, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane). Other problems existed in the separation and recovery of catalysts. Alternatively, phase transfer catalysts (PTCs) could provide a practical strategy to solve the above drawbacks [1,7]. Phase transfer catalysis is a powerful tool for accelerating the rate of a reaction, especially under biphasic reaction conditions, such as those found in liquid-liquid or solid-liquid systems [15]. In the past years, ionic liquids (ILs) as PTCs have been exhibiting high catalytic activities in the oxidation of alcohols and other organic reactions [16]. Despite considerable progress in this area, the separation of the PTCs after the reaction still remains a major barrier to the practical applications of these systems [17]. To address this limitation, considerable research efforts have been directed towards the immobilization of PTCs on various supports, such as SiO2 [18], silica gel [19], polymeric materials [20,21] and mesoporous molecular sieves [22]. However, the application of these supports has been limited by their poor mechanical strength, low surface area, poor thermal stability or poor hydrothermal stability, as well as the high costs associated with the use of structure-directing agents. Graphene oxide (GO) has been used as a promising support in many catalytic reactions [23–26] because of its many interesting properties, including its large surface area, high chemical and thermal stability, ease of fabrication and limited mass transfer resistance [24,27]. One of the main advantages of using GO as a support compared with conventional supports is that GO is a distinctive 2D amphiphile. GO has a largely hydrophobic domain and a hydrophilic periphery derived from an abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups (i.e., hydroxyl, carboxyl and epoxy groups) [28,29]. Liu et al. [30] reported that phosphotungstic acid immobilized on an aminopropyl-functionalized GO exhibited catalytic activity for the H2O2-assisted oxidation of alcohols. However, this system showed poor catalytic activity (benzyl alcohol conversion of 76%) and reusability characteristics. Leng et al. [31] reported that the POM-based ILs (e.g. [Bmim]3PW) are effective for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. To the best of our knowledge, no any reports exist wherein GO supported POM-based ILs were used as PTCs. Herein, we report the use of amphiphilic GO as a support and the synthesis of a GO-immobilized POM anion-paired ILs (Im-PW/GO). We also investigated the catalytic performance of this PTC for the oxidation of alcohols using H2O2 in the absence of solvent."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and characterization,"2.1 Materials and characterization Graphite powder (99.95%) was purchased from Aladdin, China. (3-chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane (99%) was supplied by Energy Chemical, China. All of the other chemicals were purchased as the analytical reagent grade and used directly without further purification. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Tensor 27 (Bruker) spectrometer using KBr Pellets, scanning from 4000 to 400cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a PHI 5000C spectrometer (PerkinElmer) using Al Kα radiation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded on a Park Scientific CP-Research system (VEECO) operating in the tapping mode with a Si wafer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA 7 instrument (PerkinElmer) using a temperature gradient of 10°Cmin−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Contact angles were determined on a DropMeter A-100P contact angle meter. To analyze the content of POM-based IL grafted on GO, the Im-PW/GO composite was calcinated at 700°C under air for 2h to eliminate C, H, and N elements, and the residue containing P, W and Si was digested in HF–HCl (a.q.) solution. The final amount of grafted IL was calculated based on the content of W element by means of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a Vista-AX (Varian) instrument. Elemental analysis was conducted on a CHN elemental analyzer (FlashEA 1112, Eager 300 Software). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image was obtained on a SUPRA 55 field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) photograph was taken on a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope operating at 200kV."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Preparation of 1-methyl-3-trimethoxysilylpropyl imidazolium chloride The preparation of Im-PW/GO was shown in Scheme 1 . 1-Methyl-3-trimethoxysilylpropyl imidazolium chloride (denoted as Im-Cl) was prepared as described previously [26]. Briefly, an equimolar mixture of 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane and N-methylimidazole was stirred vigorously at 80°C for 48h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature and washed three times with ether before being dried under vacuum at 50°C for 12h to afford Im-Cl as viscous oil. 2.2.2 Synthesis of immobilized ionic liquid Im-Cl/GO GO sheets were synthesized using raw graphite powders according to a modified version of the procedure reported by Hummers [32]. For the immobilization of Im-Cl on the GO sheets, we heated a mixture of GO (0.1g) and Im-Cl (2g) in ethanol (100mL) at reflux for 24h under a nitrogen atmosphere with vigorous stirring. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filter was washed with ethanol (50mL) and deionized water (50mL) for several times. The solid material was then dried under vacuum at 50°C for 12h, affording the desired Im-Cl/GO material. The loading of IL in Im-Cl/GO was about 1.47mmol/g determined by elemental analysis. 2.2.3 Synthesis of immobilized ionic liquid Im-PW/GO catalyst A dispersion of Im-Cl/GO (0.1g) in deionized water (10mL) was treated with a 0.01M solution of H3PW12O40 (0.1mmol, hereafter PW) in water and the resulted suspension was stirred at room temperature for 6h. A solid material formed, which was collected by filtration, thoroughly washed with water and dried under vacuum at 80°C for 12h to give the Im-PW/GO material. The introduced PW12O40 3− anion in Im-PW/GO was 0.4mmol/g determined by ICP-AES. The amount of Im-PW/GO was 1.2mmol/g, because three Cl− anions were exchanged by one PW12O40 3− anion during the ion-exchange procedure. The control Py-PW/GO (Py: pyridine) and Im-PW/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared in a similar manner."
4,Typical procedure for oxidation of alcohols,"2.3 Typical procedure for oxidation of alcohols A mixture of alcohol (40mmol), aqueous 30% hydrogen peroxide (100mmol) and catalyst Im-PW/GO (0.6g) was stirred at 90°C under air pressure in a 100mL flask for a specific period of time. The catalyst was removed by filtration and the filtrate was extracted with ether (3×20mL). The combined extracts were analyzed by GC using an SP6800A instrument equipped with an FID detector and a FFAP capillary column (30m×0.25mm×0.3μm). The GC conversion and selectivity data were calculated using dodecane as an internal standard. The spent catalyst was recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration and washed with water for repeated use."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the catalyst 3.1.1 FTIR In the FTIR spectrum of Im-Cl/GO (Fig. S1), two peaks located at 1566cm−1 and 1213cm−1 were attributed to the skeleton stretching vibration and CN stretching vibration of imidazole ring, respectively. The weak band of 1080cm−1 was indexed as the stretching vibrations of COSi. The FTIR characterization indicated that Im-Cl was successfully grafted on GO. Then, Fig. 1 showed the FTIR spectra of fresh and recovered Im-PW/GO, respectively. In the FTIR spectrum of Im-PW/GO, four bands assigned to Keggin structure appeared at 1082, 974, 893 and 816cm−1. The four bands were characterized as νas (PO), νas (WO) (terminal oxygen), νas (WObW) (corner-sharing oxygen) and νas (WOcW) (edge-sharing oxygen), respectively [8,33,40,47–49]. Meanwhile, the band at around 1080cm−1 corresponding to COSi was overlapped with the strong PO absorption of PW. These data suggest that the IL moieties were attached to the surface of the GO sheets through a condensation reaction between the hydroxyl groups on the surface of GO and the methoxyl groups of the IL, whereas the imidazole rings of Im-PW/GO were acting as anchoring sites for the PW12O40 3− heteropolyanions. 3.1.2 AFM An AFM image of Im-PW/GO is shown in Fig. 2 . From AFM, it can be seen that the sheet of Im-PW/GO material was thicker compared with GO, which was attributed to the introduction of IL groups at the periphery or on the basal plane of the GO. Similar results have also been observed for the interlay spaces of several other IL-functionalized GO materials using AFM [34–36]. It is also noteworthy that the value of thickness determined by AFM was inaccurate. The datum only reflected the line marked or a zone chosen for the analysis. Despite the intrinsic shortcoming, AFM is very useful in determining the height and number of layers of GO [37,38]. In order to illustrate further, TEM and SEM were supplemented. 3.1.3 SEM and TEM The morphology of Im-PW/GO was also observed using SEM and TEM techniques, and the images are shown in Fig. S2. The TEM image illustrated that the Im-PW/GO sample was thin and transparent, in good agreement with the images observed in the bare GO materials reported by our and other groups. Also, the SEM image displayed laminated but wrinkled structures, which were typical morphology like the bare GO samples. 3.1.4 XPS analysis Fig. 3 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey for Im-PW/GO, as well as the resolution spectra of GO and Im-PW/GO of the C1s region. It is well known that GO supports contain no elemental N, Si, W or P. The appearance of strong signals associated with these elements in the survey spectrum of Im-PW/GO therefore confirmed the successful functionalization of GO with POM-based ILs (Fig. 3A). The deconvolution of the C1s spectrum from the resolution XPS spectrum of the GO sample revealed four major peaks at 284.4, 285.4, 286.8 and 288.6eV (Fig. 3B), which were attributed to the carbon atoms of four different functional groups, namely CC, COH, COC and CO groups, respectively [26]. After the functionalization of GO with POM-based IL (Fig. 3C), we observed considerable weakening to the peaks corresponding to the hydroxyl and epoxyl groups, as well as the appearance of a new peaks, which was attributed to CN (285.9eV) bond. The fraction of COH in the oxygen-containing groups (COH, COC and CO) was approximately 22.5%, and the element atomic ratio of oxygen species in GO (containing C, H and O) was 25.4 at.%. Moreover, the weight percentages of C and H elements were analyzed by CHN elemental analysis (EA). Combining the analytic results of deconvoluted C 1s spectrum (Fig. 3B) of XPS and EA, the density of hydroxyl groups on GO was calculated to be ca. 3.57mmolg−1. On the other hand, the loading amount of Im-Cl was ca. 1.47mmolg−1. Based on reported literatures [2,39], a molecular of Im-Cl reacted with 1–3 groups of COH of GO, forming COSi functionalities. The ratio of COH groups to Im-Cl is 2.4:1, in the range of the above mentioned stoichiometric value as shown in Scheme 1. The grafting of Im-Cl on GO has also been confirmed by FTIR characterization. These facts indicated that the IL has been successfully attached to the surface of GO via the condensation between methoxyl groups of Im-Cl and COH of GO. 3.1.5 TGA & ICP-AES The TGA weight loss curves of GO and Im-PW/GO are shown in Fig. 4 . The TGA curve of Im-PW/GO revealed a total weight loss of 40.9% for temperatures in the range of 50–700°C. At temperatures up to 150°C, we observed a weight loss of 5.6%, which was attributed to the evaporation of absorbed water molecules. A second weight loss was found for temperatures in the range of 150–250°C, which was attributed to the loss of labile oxygen-containing functional groups [34]. The third weight loss region in the range of 250 and 500°C was attributed to the decomposition of the cations of the IL incorporated in the layers of the GO. At temperatures above 500°C, we observed further weight loss, which was assigned to the slow decomposition of the PW12O40 3− heteropolyanions, resulting in the formation of the constituent oxides P2O5 and WO3 [33,40], as well as carbon residue derived from pyrolysis of GO skeleton [26]. Compared with GO, the Im-PW/GO material showed a much lower weight loss, with more residues remaining. This result indicated that the POM-based IL had been successfully grafted onto the GO surface, which is consistent with the above FTIR and XPS characterization data. In addition, we also used ICP-AES to analyze the content of IL grafted on GO based on the W element, and PW content in the Im-PW/GO was found ca. 0.4mmol/g GO. According to the mechanism described in Scheme 1, Im-PW/GO material was prepared by exchanging three Cl− anions with one PW12O40 3− anion. Therefore, the grafting amount of Im-Cl on GO material was ca. 1.2mmol/g, which was less than 1.43mmol/g. Such sight difference in term of the grafting amount of Im-PW probably originated from the efficiency of ion-exchange between Cl− and PW12O40 3− anion. In other words, a small proportion of the Cl− anions in Im-Cl had not been completely exchanged by the PW12O40 3− anion."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The selective oxidations of benzyl alcohol over various catalysts were examined by aqueous 30% H2O2. In most cases, water-organic-solid (L1-L2-S) triphase systems were observed because of the insolubility of GO and poor solubility of benzyl alcohol in aqueous media.v Under the reaction conditions employed in this work, the by-product was solely benzoic acid, due to deep oxidation of benzaldehyde. As shown in Table 1 , compared with blank experiment, pure GO exhibited certain catalytic activity (Conversion of 13.6, Entry 2 in Table 1). GO is a typically amphiphilic material as GO has a largely hydrophobic domain and a hydrophilic periphery derived from an abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g. hydroxyl, carboxyl and epoxy groups). The characterization result also verified that GO possessed distinct amphiphilic nature. It is the amphiphilic nature of GO that facilitated the contact of hydrophilic H2O2 and hydrophobic benzyl alcohol, which promoted the phase transfer reaction. Im-PW of 0.72mmol showed a high catalytic activity in this study (entry 4, conversion of 77.2%). The amount of PW12O40 3− in Im-PW of 0.72mmol was 0.24mmol (obtained by 0.72mmol×1/3). However, Im-PW are usually difficult to be separated and recycled from the liquid–liquid biphasic system (H2O2–benzyl alcohol) because the two materials have good solubility in aqueous phase [33]. Therefore, many researchers have been conducted to immobilize phosophotungstic acid on various supports. As a heterogeneous catalyst, IM-PW/GO was easily recovered and reused. In contrast, using Im-PW/GO, the reaction gave a high conversion of 90.8% with 99.2% selectivity to benzaldehyde (entry 5). In comparison with POM-based IL immobilized on SBA-15 (Im-PW/SBA-15), Im-PW/GO catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity and selectivity for this oxidation under the same reaction conditions (entries 5 and 7). In above test, the amount of PW12O40 3− in 0.6g of Im-PW of GO and Im-PW/SBA-15 was 0.24 and 0.25mmol (obtained by 0.6g×0.4mmol/g and 0.6g×0.42mmol/g), respectively. In this work, the amphiphilic nature of GO has been fully confirmed by the contact-angle tests (Fig. 5 ). Furthermore, the characterization result also verified that Im-PW/GO possessed distinct amphiphilic nature whereas Im-PW/SBA-15 was mainly hydrophilic. On the other hand, in the case of selective oxidation benzyl alcohol proceeding in the presence of H2O2, it is a common sense that benzyl alcohol is hydrophobic (or lipophilic, difficult to be dissolved in aqueous solution) while H2O2 is absolutely hydrophilic. The detailed catalytic mechanism is depicted in Scheme 2 . Initially, hydrophilic H2O2 reacted with the PW12O40 3−, yielding active peroxo species. Afterwards, the peroxo species oxidized hydrophobic benzyl alcohol, which thereafter was transformed into the target molecule (benzaldehyde). In sharp contrast, due to its sole hydrophility, Im-PW/SBA-15 suffered from relatively inferior efficiency in the contact of the two reactants, consequently offered lower catalytic activity than Im-PW/GO under the same reaction conditions. These results suggest that the GO support contributes obviously to this reaction, where the Im-PW/GO catalyst serves as a triphase phase transfer agent and thus easily carries the PW12O40 heteropolyanion from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Additionally, as the imidazole unit in the immobilized IL-cation was changed into pyridine, the prepared Py-PW/GO catalyst showed a good yield of 87.4% and selectivity of 99.8% in the presence of H2O2 (entry 6), indicating a compositional flexibility of catalysts. The performance characteristics of Im-PW/GO were determined under different reaction conditions by varying the molar ratio of H2O2 to benzyl alcohol, reaction temperature, reaction time and the amount of catalyst to obtain the optimum conditions for the conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity. As shown in Table S1, the conversion of benzyl alcohol increased with increasing reaction time, temperature and amount of catalyst. We tested the effect of the molar ratio of substrate/hydrogen peroxide on the catalytic performance (Table S1 entries 3, 4 and 11). When the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to benzyl alcohol was 2.5:1, the conversion of benzyl alcohol reached the maximum value (90.8%). In the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to benzyl alcohol of 1:1, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was decreased from 90.8% (2.5:1) to 65.4%, while the, benzaldehyde selectivity was almost unchanged. Similar experimental results have been reported in other literatures [30,41]. The use of a large excess of the catalyst, high temperature of 95°C or an increase in the reaction time (entries 6, 8 and 10), had very little impact on the conversion and resulted in a considerable decrease in the benzaldehyde selectivity (Table 2 ). Given that Im-PW/GO could efficiently catalyze the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in the presence of aqueous H2O2, we investigated the application of this catalyst to several other alcohols, including cyclopentanol, 2-butyl alcohol, 1-amyl alcohol, 4-methy benzyl alcohol, cyclohexanol and 1-Octyl alcohol. The results revealed that high conversions were obtained for cyclopentanol (97%), 2-butyl alcohol (99.8%), 4-methy benzyl alcohol (88.6%) and cyclohexanol (87.9%), whereas 1-amyl alcohol (26.1%) and 1-Octyl alcohol (49.1%) afforded a much lower yield (entries 1–6). The oxidation of long chain aliphatic alcohols has reported to be sluggish over several catalysts, including PW-NH2-IL-SBA-15 [33] and phosphotungstate hybrids [Dmim]1.5PW [42]."
8,Comparison the result of this study with that of related references,"3.3 Comparison the result of this study with that of related references In order to comparison the result of this study with that of others, the related references were listed in Table 3 [9,11–13,45,46]. In these reported papers, tungsten-based catalytic systems for oxidation of alcohols (or olefins) with hydrogen peroxide showed high catalytic activity and selectivity. Indeed, the performance of some catalysts is superior to that of our catalyst. On the other hand, in the reported papers, some of the oxidation reactions were carried out under the conditions of adding organic solvents, such as acetonitrile. Other problems existed in the separation and recovery of catalysts. In our study, IM-PW/GO was readily recovered and reused up to four times without any significant loss in terms of its activity."
9,Catalysis mechanism,"3.4 Catalysis mechanism To determine the wettability of related catalysts for the organic substrate, a droplet of benzyl alcohol was brought into contact with the surfaces of bare GO, Im-PW/GO and Im-PW/SBA-15 samples. As shown in Fig. 5(top), the contact angle of Im-PW/GO (∼25°) was smaller than that of Im-PW/SBA-15 (∼40°), most likely because of the greater hydrophilicity of the SBA-15 surface [42,43]. In the case of the contact with hydrophilic H2O2 solution, the contact angles of the bare GO and Im-PW/GO materials were 20 and 27°, respectively (bottom of Fig. 5). The value was very close to the contact angle observed on the SBA-15 material. The above tests evidenced that either GO or the immobilized Im-PW/GO was amphiphilic. Based on this result, we proposed a mechanism for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol over Im-PW/GO, which behaved as a triphase transfer catalyst (Scheme 2). The activity of the PW12O40 3− heteropolyanion would be restricted by the imidazole-moiety of the cation in Im-PW/GO, forming a Q3 3+–PW12O40 3− ionic pair through electrostatic interactions. Aqueous H2O2 would react with the PW12O40 3− heteropolyanion to generate the active peroxo species {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3− [16,33,40,44], which would transfer an anion to the benzyl alcohol phase. The peroxo species would then oxidize the benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, resulting in the regeneration of the initial PW12O40 heteropolyanion. Finally, the regenerated PW12O40 heteropolyanion would move back into the water phase. Since benzyl alcohol is a lipophilic alcohol, individual benzyl alcohol molecule would be finely dispersed on the surface of the Im-PW/GO composite. Since GO is a typical 2D material, no barriers in mass transfer would accelerate the rate of this triphase transfer reaction between the {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3− anion and the benzyl alcohol. It is therefore clear that the amphiphilicity of Im-PW/GO plays a key role in its excellent catalytic performance."
10,Catalyst reusability,"3.5 Catalyst reusability Finally, we assessed the recyclability of Im-PW/GO for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol under the optimum conditions. Upon completion of the catalytic reaction, the catalyst was separated from the liquid phase by filtration, thoroughly washed with water and reused for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of H2O2. As shown in Fig. 6 , the initial yield of the selective oxidation was 90.1%. Similar yields of benzaldehyde were obtained in all four recycling rounds with a negligible reduction in the catalytic activity after the second round of recycling. At the fourth reaction run, 98.3wt% of the catalyst (compared to the amount of 0.6g catalyst) was recovered and 87.8% yield was obtained (88.4% of conversion and 99.4% of selectivity). The result of ICP-AES analysis for the reacted filtrate showed that less than 0.9wt% W of Im-PW/GO has been leached into the reaction media. Furthermore, the FTIR bands in 800–1100cm−1 assigned to PW for the recovered catalyst was very similar to those of the fresh one (Fig. 1, curves b and c), whereas the intensities of the stretching vibration bands at 974 and 816cm−1 decreased to some extent. These results might be an indication of the slight deactivation of the recovered catalyst. To rule out the potential leaching problem for this phase-transfer catalyst, the reaction was stopped immediately at 4h, and the Im-PW/GO catalyst was filtered. After that, the reaction was performed again without the catalyst under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. S3, after the hot filtration, the catalytic activity showed no significant increase, confirming that the present catalytic system was a typical heterogeneous reaction."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, GO material has been employed as an amphiphilic support to immobilize POM-based ILs. The Im-PW/GO behaved as an eco-friendly triphase transfer catalyst for the selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes using aqueous H2O2 as an oxidant. Notably, the heterogeneous Im-PW/GO catalyst was readily recovered and reused four times without any obvious decrease in its activity. This catalyst showed higher activity than the control catalyst Im-PW/SBA-15. We have proposed a triphase transfer catalytic mechanism to account for the superior catalytic performance of Im-PW/GO. This work highlights the great potential of IL-immobilized GO as a highly efficient triphase transfer catalyst."
