0,Introduction,"Growing energy demands in a time of dwindling fossil fuel supplies has attracted much attention to hydrogen as an energy carrier. Biomass too has received significant attention as an alternate energy source because it is renewable and essentially carbon dioxide neutral since CO2 generated during the fuel use is subsequently fixed by growing plants during photosynthesis. Glycerol, HOCH2–CHOH–CH2OH, is obtained as a byproduct from biodiesel manufacturing by transesterification of vegetable oils. Approximately 1kg of glycerol is produced for every 9kg of biodiesel. From 2004 to 2006, annual US biodiesel production has increased from 25 to 250 million gallons [1]. Johnston and Holloway [2] project a US biodiesel production potential of almost 850 million gallons per year. With increasing production of biodiesel, an excess of glycerol is expected to flood the market, and therefore it is essential to find new uses. Currently, glycerol is used in many applications including personal care, food, oral care, tobacco, polymers, and pharmaceuticals. Another use is the production of 1,2-propanediol and 1,3-propanediol by hydrogenation of glycerol, replacing the petroleum feedstock used presently [3]. Another emerging use is to utilize glycerol for the production of hydrogen. The topic of glycerol reforming for hydrogen production has received some attention in the literature [4–10]. Shabaker and Dumesic [6] produced hydrogen from biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons including glycerol in an aqueous phase reforming process. Czernik and co-workers [7] have produced hydrogen via steam reforming of crude glycerol using a commercial nickel based naphtha reforming catalyst. Hirai et al. [8] have reported the performance of noble metal based catalysts for glycerol reforming and found ruthenium to be the most active of the Group 8–10 metals. Recently, Adhikari et al. [11] performed a thermodynamic analysis for hydrogen production by steam reforming of glycerol. Their study revealed that the best conditions for producing hydrogen is at a temperature >625°C and a molar ratio of water to glycerol of 9:1. Under these conditions methane production is minimized and carbon formation is thermodynamically inhibited. Although excess water in the feed increases the hydrogen production, a significant amount of unreacted water remains in the reactor effluent. Corma et al. [12] have studied the biomass-derived feeds glycerol and sorbitol using fluidized catalytic cracking and reported a wide range of products including hydrogen, paraffins, olefins, aromatics, and coke. Supercritical water (SCW) reforming of hydrocarbons and biomass materials has been paid more attention recently [13–18]. Kersten et al. [19] have reported gasification results for glycerol and other model compounds in a variety of catalytic and non-catalytic reactors in SCW and found that without addition of a catalyst, only very dilute concentrations of model biomass feeds could be completely gasified. SCW has properties entirely different from those of liquid water or steam. The dielectric constant of SCW is much lower, and the number of hydrogen bonds is much lower and their strength is weaker. Therefore SCW has high miscibility with many organic solvents and gases. The density of SCW is higher than that of steam resulting in a higher space time yield, and higher thermal conductivity and specific heat, which are helpful in carrying out the endothermic reforming reactions. Transport properties, too, are unique in that SCW has both low viscosity and high diffusivity. The formation of char and tar is also minimized because of the solubility of hydrocarbons in SCW. Importantly, hydrogen produced from SCW reforming is produced at high pressure, which can be stored directly, thus avoiding large expenses associated with compression. Reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production can be summarized by following reactions. First, the steam reforming of glycerol: (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 → H 2 O 3 CO + 4 H 2 Followed by the water–gas shift reaction: (2) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 The desired overall reaction is then summarized as: (3) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 7 H 2 + 3 CO 2 Some hydrogen is also lost via the methanation of CO and CO2: (4) CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O (5) CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O As a result, the product stream is a mixture of above gases. Furthermore, the yield of hydrogen depends on several process variables, such as system pressure, temperature, and water to glycerol feed ratio. Most of the above studies were done in batch mode, in which the biomass/water/catalyst is loaded in a small steel tube reactor and then sealed and placed in an oven. After the reaction, the mixture is quenched and analyzed. Typical reaction time varied from minutes to hours. In our recent work on methanol and glucose reforming, it was observed that high reaction time leads to the secondary reaction of methane formation [13,14]. To limit the methane formation reaction time needs to be limited to the order of seconds. The aim of this study is to examine hydrogen production from glycerol in SCW in a continuous reactor with a short reaction time (of the order of seconds). Ru/Al2O3 is selected as a catalyst. The effects of the process variables such as temperature, contact time, and water to glycerol ratio on hydrogen yield are investigated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Glycerol (99.5% purity) was obtained from Fisher Scientific. The commercial 5wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was purchased unreduced from Aldrich, and was subsequently reduced under hydrogen flow at 500°C for 6h. The catalyst had the following characteristics: total BET surface area: 100m2/g; crystal structure: amorphous; specific pore volume: 0.30mL/g; density: 0.95g/cm3. Deionized water was obtained from a Millipore Direct-Q 5 water purification system."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure The schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1 . The details of the experimental procedure are discussed elsewhere [14], and are briefly provided here. Experiments were conducted in supercritical water in a fixed-bed tubular flow reactor (0.5m long, 0.25in. OD and 0.12in. ID) made of Inconel 600 (Microgroup) having a composition of 73% Ni, 18% Cr, and 9% Fe, which was placed inside a temperature controlled furnace (Thermolyne 21100) covered on each end to reduce heat loss and ensure temperature uniformity. The reactor was packed with 2g catalyst. The details of experimental conditions are given in Table 1 . A glycerol–water solution from a feed reservoir was pumped to a tee using a HPLC pump (Waters 590). Due to the hygroscopic nature of glycerol, batches of pure glycerol were diluted with water to 66.7wt% and kept covered to prevent absorption of additional water from the atmosphere. The glycerol solution then mixes with a stream of supercritical water, also by HPLC pump (Alltech 301), heated to the reaction temperature. The reactor temperature at the exit of the furnace was measured using a type-K thermocouple with a tee arrangement. The gas mixture exiting the reactor was cooled using a water-cooled double pipe heat exchanger made of SS 316 tubing. The pressure was let down to the ambient by means of a back pressure regulator (Straval). The gas–liquid mixture was separated in a glass phase-separator having gas tight valves to prevent the escape of gases. The exit gas flow rate was measured using a gas flow meter (Omega FMA-1600). The gas composition was determined using a gas chromatograph (SRI 8610C) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 60/80 Carboxen-1000 carbon molecular sieve column (Supelco 15ft×1/8in.) using nitrogen as the carrier gas. Sample injection to the gas chromatograph was done online by means of a six-port injection valve (Valco) having a 100μL sample loop. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the liquid effluent was measured using a TOC analyzer (Shimazdu TOC-VCSN). All measurements were taken at least in triplicate to ensure accuracy, which were further checked by calculating the overall carbon balance for the system. Scattering in the data of the totalized gas flow rate measured by the flow meter was less than 1%. The error in the dry gas composition obtained by the GC analysis was typically less than 2%. The overall error in the calculation of gas yields due to the errors introduced by the individual analysis techniques and experimental error was found to be less than 5%. Experimental results in which the carbon exiting the system was calculated to differ by more than 10% of the known amount entering were discarded."
4,Results and discussion,"Production of hydrogen and other compounds at different temperatures, water to glycerol feed ratios, and residence times have been analyzed. Supercritical reforming of glycerol produced a stream rich in H2 and CO2 with small amounts of CH4 and CO. Over the temperature, residence times, and water to glycerol mass ratio ranges analyzed, the conversion of glycerol was always greater than 99%, and it can be considered that the conversion was complete. Our previous study [20] showed that changing pressure has minor effect in the supercritical region, thus only one pressure was studied. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were done by minimizing Gibbs free energy using Peng–Robinson equation of state in CHEMCAD 5.2.0. The calculated results are shown as lines in Figs. 2–4 . The simulation did not predict coke formation for any of the experimental conditions in this paper."
5,Effect of reaction time,"3.1 Effect of reaction time Residence time in the catalyst bed was controlled by the inlet flowrate of reactants. The product gas yields are shown as a function of residence time in Fig. 2. The residence times of 1, 2 and 4s correspond to space time (mass of catalyst in bed/molar flow rate of glucose, W/F Ao) values of 0.136, 0.221, and 0.353g cat-s/μmol glycerol, respectively. The shortest residence time gave high hydrogen yield, however at larger residence times the hydrogen yield drops sharply with a decline in CO2 yields as well. Considering this along with the increase in methane suggests that Eq. (5), the methanation of carbon dioxide, becomes important at longer residence times. Hence, it is desirable to keep residence time short in order to maximize the hydrogen yield."
6,Effect of temperature,"3.2 Effect of temperature The influence of temperature was studied by varying the furnace temperature from 700 to 800°C. Hydrogen yield increases with temperature as shown in Fig. 3 . It can also be seen that the methane yield is slightly higher at 700°C. The same trend is present in the calculated equilibrium concentration with slightly more methane present at lower temperatures. It should be noted that continued operation at 700°C for feed concentrations greater than 5wt% glycerol resulted in plugging of the reactor, however this problem was solved by operating at 800°C. At lower temperatures, the reaction rates for reactions leading to coke formation are higher than the rates of the reforming and carbon gasification reactions [21]. At temperatures below 800°, the experimental hydrogen yield is lower than the equilibrium values, but is accompanied by higher than predicted methane yield."
7,Effect of glycerol feed concentration,"3.3 Effect of glycerol feed concentration Feed concentration is an important economic consideration, it is not desirable to heat and pump more water through the system than is necessary. To study the effect of feed concentration, the glycerol concentration was varied from 5–40wt% glycerol. Fig. 4 shows that increasing the feed concentration was coupled with a decrease in the yield of hydrogen and an accompanying increase in the methane yield. This can be explained by considering that less water is present at the higher concentrations, and it is known that at low steam/carbon ratios CO is more likely to produce methane by consuming hydrogen [22]. The carbon balance showed that complete conversion of glycerol to gaseous products was realized even for the highest feed concentrations tested. It can be seen that the experimental gas yields closely mirror the equilibrium concentrations calculated from simulation, indicating that the reaction is near its thermodynamic equilibrium. For higher concentrations, experimental carbon monoxide yields are smaller than predicted at equilibrium. Paired with higher than predicted hydrogen and carbon dioxide yields, this indicates the water–gas shift reaction going near completion."
8,Reaction kinetics,"3.4 Reaction kinetics The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons entails a complex network of reactions. Adsorption and decomposition of oxygenated compounds containing hydroxyl groups such as methanol and ethylene glycol has been studied extensively on noble metal surfaces. Oxygenated compounds containing hydroxyl groups have been shown to adsorb to the catalytic Ru surface predominantly through one or more oxygen atoms. First the reactant undergoes dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface, followed by subsequent cleavage of C–C or C–O bonds. Cleavage of C–C bonds leads to synthesis gas which is subjected to the water–gas shift reaction and possible methanation, while cleavage of C–O bonds gives organic acids and alcohols [3]. The ruthenium catalyst is known to have a high activity for C–C bond scission [23]. Very low levels of organic carbon in the liquid effluent suggests that any intermediate alcohol or organic acids formed from C–O bond breaking were further reacted to gaseous products. Hence, the following kinetic model is proposed for the reforming of glycerol in supercritical water: (6) A + S ↔ k 1 , k - 1 AS (7) AS + B → k 2 ABS (8) ABS → k 3 Intermediates → k 4 CO 2 + H 2 where A and B represent glycerol and water, respectively, and S represents an active site on the catalyst surface. Eq. (6) describes the reversible adsorption of glycerol on the catalyst, and Eq. (7) represents the reaction of the adsorbed glycerol with water to form an adsorbed complex molecule, ABS. Assuming steady state of adsorbed intermediates and that decomposition of ABS to form intermediate products is the rate-limiting step, the dependence of rate (r) on partial pressures (p) can be expressed as (9) r = k 1 k 2 p A p B k - 1 + k 1 p A + k 2 p B + ( k 1 k 2 p A p B / k 3 ) . Considering that water is in excess, Eq. (9) may be simplified to (10) r = k R p A 1 + bp A , where k R and b are lumped parameters defined as (11) k R = k 1 k 2 p Bo k - 1 + bp Bo and (12) b = k 1 + ( k 1 k 2 p Bo / k 3 ) k - 1 + k 2 p Bo Eq. (10) was solved using a regression on rate of hydrogen production for several values of partial pressures of glycerol at 750 and 800°C. Calculated values of k R are 1.9×10−5 and 2.6×10−5 μmol/g cat-s-bar at 750°C and 800°C, respectively. Based on the temperature dependence of the rate constant, activation energy E a for the reaction was found to be 55.9kJ/mol. Glycerol reforming experiments were continued to evaluate the catalyst activity loss due to carbon formation. There was negligible change in reaction rate and hydrogen product yield as same catalyst was used for all the runs without any regeneration. Dispersion of Ru was not measured, but it is expected that it should decrease under the operating conditions used. Kellner and Bell [24] have reported previously that decreased dispersion can result in increased methane formation. Our recent study [18] found changes to the catalyst support after exposure to supercritical water. SEM images and XRD spectra showed that crystallinity increased in our previous study using this amorphous catalyst support, as shown in Fig. 5 . The fresh catalyst consists of more-or-less round particles, characteristic of amorphous materials, whereas the used catalyst is clustered in aggregates of sharp-edged crystals. It is expected that the catalyst support underwent similar morphological changes in the present study."
9,Conclusions,"Reforming of glycerol in supercritical water over Ru/Al2O3 catalyst is an effective means of high pressure hydrogen production from a biomass-derived source. Although near-theoretical hydrogen yields were obtained for dilute glycerol concentrations at 800°C, it was also found to be possible to completely gasify feed containing upto 40wt% glycerol, but with increased methane formation. Hydrogen yields were found to increase directly with temperature. Methane formation can be reduced by operating at low residence times. Values of the rate constant based upon a simplified kinetic model are reported at 750 and 800°C, and based upon those an activation energy of 55.9kJ/mol was observed."
