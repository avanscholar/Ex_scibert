0,Introduction,"Acute alcohol-induced liver injury refers to liver damage caused by a very high consumption of alcohol over a short period of time (Massey & Arteel, 2012; Zeng et al., 2008). The initial damage begins with a condition termed liver steatosis, which can further lead to fatty liver, hepatitis, and/or fibrosis, culminating in cirrhosis, hepatic necrosis, or liver cancer (Zhao et al., 2016). Drinking alcohol is a social etiquette in China. Unfortunately, it makes a considerable number of Chinese populations susceptible to acute liver injury caused by alcohol. In addition, the acute liver injury is generally related to the oxidative stress, which is caused by the cellular excess of reactive oxygen species (Eman & Mohamed, 2014). Several natural plant extracts have been proved to show beneficial effects against the liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (Eman et al., 2014; Eman, Mohamed, & Mohamed, 2018). Therefore, exploring natural supplements is important in practice, which can be used as an effective antioxidant against oxidative stress in the liver caused by alcohol drinking (Bergheim, Mcclain, & Arteel, 1993; Yinzhong Liu, Gao, & Jiang, 2008). Noni fruit juice is fermented by its intrinsic enzymes and natural mutualistic microorganisms (Yang, Paulino, Janke-Stedronsky, & Abawi, 2007). It is a new type of fermented beverage with high nutritional value (Chan-Blanco et al., 2006). Earlier studies have shown that noni juice, pasteurized fermented juice, and freeze-dried noni pulp can activate antioxidative and anti-inflammatory functions in the liver. Wang et al. reported that there was a reduction in carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic steatosis in rats following daily consumption of 6 mL of Noni juice for 12 successive weeks (Wang, Anderson, Nowicki, & Jensen, 2008). Liu et al. reported the role of noni juice in relieving the carbon tetrachloride induced acute chemical damage of liver by inhibiting oxidative stress. Nayak et al. found that fermented noni juice can lower blood sugar level and regulate liver functions (Nayak, Marshall, Isitor, & Adogwa, 2011). Similarly, Lin et al. reported that fermented noni juice can regulate the activity of antioxidant-related enzymes in the body in addition to regulating the release of inflammatory factors (Lin, Chang, Yang, Tzang, & Chen, 2013). In this study, the roles of noni fruit and fermented noni juice in attenuating acute alcohol-induced liver injury were evaluated by measuring the activity of oxidative-stress biomarkers. The antioxidant capacities of noni fruit and fermented noni juice at different fermentation times were determined in vitro and the functional activities were verified using an acute alcohol-induced liver injury model in mice. This will provide a theoretical basis for the commercial applications of noni fruit and fermented noni juice."

Briefly, 1 mL of diluted juice was mixed with 1 mL of 1% FeCN solution and 1 mL of 0.2 mol/L PBS buffer (pH 6.6), and the mixture was then placed in a water bath at 50 °C for 20 min. The sample was allowed to cool to room temperature, and 1 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid solution was added and then centrifuged at 3000g/min for 10 min. A 1 mL sample of the supernatant was mixed with 1 mL of 0.1% (w/v) FeCl3 solution and the mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 6000g/min for 10 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was then measured at 700 nm. Distilled water was used as a control, and the reducing power was calculated using Eq. (3).

7,Animals,"2.6 Animals Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China) and kept in specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal experiment center at Jiangnan University. The mice had free access to commercial mouse food and drinking water. All the protocols for this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of Jiangnan University, China (JN. No20171030c0961230). The procedures for the four animal experiments are shown in Fig. 1 ."
8,Animal experiments,"2.7 Animal experiments The model of acute alcohol-induced liver damage was established following the Reference Health Food Inspection and Evaluation Specifications (2003 Edition) guidelines and the method described by Cai, Ana, Nanyan, and Shaoyun (2017). The mice were fed by intragastric administration once a day for one week and then randomly divided into ten groups of eight members. The negative control group (NCG) and model group (MG) were intragastrically administered 10 mL/kg·BW distilled water per day. The positive control group (PCG) were treated with biphenyl diester (intragastrically administered dose of 150 mg/kg·BW) (Guo, Tao, Cheng, Zhao, & Xing, 2016). The animal experiments included four sub-experiments, which were negative control group (NCG), model group (MG), positive control group (PCG) and noni fruit and fermented noni juice group. The noni fruit and fermented noni juice group included seven sub-groups, which were fresh fruit (FF), ripe fruit (RF), 15-day fermented juice (15d-FJ), 40-day fermented juice (40d-FJ), 60-day fermented juice (60d-FJ), 180-day fermented juice (180d-FJ) and 365-day fermented juice (365d-FJ). The experimental mice groups were intragastrically administered with fermented noni juice (10 mL/kg BW) sampled from different fermentation times. The body weight of mice was weighed and recorded every three days during feeding, and the amount of gastric perfusion was adjusted. After the last 6-h gavage, the negative control group (NCG) was given 12 mL/kg·BW distilled water, and the other nine groups were intragastrically treated with 50% ethanol solution (12 mL/kg·BW). After the last gavage, the mice were fasted for 12 h, and then anesthetized by injection of pentobarbital solution (mass fraction of 1%). The anesthetized mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The eyeballs were quickly picked out to collect blood and the liver was dissected and weighed."
9,Mouse biochemical index detection,"2.8 Mouse biochemical index detection Aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), alanine aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), serum cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) in mice serum were analyzed using an automatic biochemical analyzer. The concentrations of TC, TG, GSH, and MDA and the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in mice liver homogenate were detected by assay kits."
10,Histopathological studies,"2.9 Histopathological studies A slice of tissue from the same location in the left lobe of the mouse liver was fixed with a mass fraction of 10% formaldehyde solution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin dye, and photographed using a microscope."
11,Statistical analysis,"2.10 Statistical analysis The experimental data were analyzed using Origin 8.5 (OriginLab Co., USA) and SPSS 19.0 (IBM Co., USA) software. Duncan’s test was used to test for significance. P < 0.05 indicates a significant difference; P < 0.01 indicates a high significant difference."
12,Results,
13,In vitro antioxidant activity of noni fruit and fermented noni juice,"3.1 In vitro antioxidant activity of noni fruit and fermented noni juice The DPPH scavenging ability of noni fruit and fermented noni juice is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The DPPH scavenging ability of FF, RF, and 2d-FJ was above 90% in each case. The DPPH-scavenging ability of the fermented noni juice gradually decreased with an increase in fermentation time, but it remained stable at 70% after fermentation for 40 d until the end of the fermentation process (100 d). The hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability of noni fruit and fermented noni juice is shown in Fig. 2(b). The hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability of both FF and RF was above 90% and the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of 2d-FJ was 78%, which gradually increased over the fermentation time. A reducing power assay was used to determine the free radical scavenging potential, and the reducing power of noni fruit and fermented noni juice is shown in Fig. 2(c). The reducing power of FF was much higher than that of RF and fermented noni juice. The evaluation of antioxidant capacity using a single indicator did not prove to be effective (Hua, Gao, Zhou, Cai, & Yao, 2008; Ma, Chen, Su, & West, 2013). Evaluation of antioxidant capacity using a single indicator has not proven to be effective. Therefore, the above three indicators are selected for comprehensive determination of the antioxidant capacity of noni juice and fermented juice. The results showed that FF had better anti-oxidation ability to DPPH scavenging ability, hydroxyl radical scavenging ability and reducing power. After 40 d fermentation, the antioxidant capacity of Noni fermented juice did not change (Dussossoy et al., 2011). The antioxidant activity of fermented noni juice depended on the fermentation time. We found that fermented noni juice (two-day fermentation) showed the highest antioxidant potential based on the DPPH-scavenging ability and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability (Gupta & Singh, 2013)."
14,"The effects of noni fruit and fermented juice on the body weight, liver weight and liver index of mice","3.2 The effects of noni fruit and fermented juice on the body weight, liver weight and liver index of mice The protective effects of noni fruit and fermented noni juice on acute alcohol-induced liver injury were evaluated in mice. As shown in Table 1 , the body weight, liver weight and liver index were significantly higher in the model group (MG) than those in the negative control group (NCG). Compared with the MG group, there were no significant differences in the body weight for the positive control group (PCG) and noni treated groups. The liver weight and liver index were significantly lower in the PCG, FF and 15d-FJ groups than those in the MG group, indicating that noni fruit and fermented juice had the potential to prevent the occurrence of alcohol-induced liver enlargement and can provide some protection from alcoholic liver damage, which was in accordance with the previous study (Yang, Han, Delude, & Fink, 2003)."
15,The effects of noni fruit and fermented juice on the liver function of mice,"3.3 The effects of noni fruit and fermented juice on the liver function of mice Compared with the NCG group, the AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT levels in the serum were significantly higher in the MG group and the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT were lower in the PCG, noni fruit, and fermented noni juice groups (Fig. 3 ). In comparison with the MG group, the mice treated with noni juice showed greater hepatocyte membrane integrity, which reduced the effect of alcohol on liver function by maintaining the liver function index in a normal state (Gohari, Bangale, Fayazi, Moghaddam, & Jamshidi, 2014; Yang, He, Huang, Zhang, & He, 2018). This reduction effect was significant in the FF, RF, 15d-FJ, and 40d-FJ groups. With the prolongation of fermentation time, the reduction effect was decreased, indicating that the prolongation of fermentation time did not enhance the liver-protective effects, and fermented noni juice (<40 days) displayed optimal efficacy. As shown in Fig. 4 , alcohol ingestion induced a significant increase in TG levels in the serum and liver in mice. Noni fruit (FF and RF) and fermented noni juice (15d-FJ, 180d-FJ and 365d-FJ) decreased the TG to the desirable levels comparable to the PCG. Noni fruit and fermented noni juice were found to reduce total cholesterol (TC) levels in serum and liver in several treatment groups of mice, but this effect was most pronounced in mice in the PCG group. Alcohol intake increased the levels TC in serum and liver, whereas fermented noni juice could effectively reduce the TC levels (Fig. 5 ). Alcohol intake led to a decrease in HDL-C content and an increase in LDL-C content in the serum (Fig. 6 ), while noni fruit and fermented noni juice ameliorated these harmful effects (Kühnast, Fiocco, Hoorn, Princen, & Jukema, 2015; Sanossian & Tarlov, 2008)."
16,Effect of noni fruit and fermented noni juice on antioxidant capacity of mouse liver and prevention of liver damage,"3.4 Effect of noni fruit and fermented noni juice on antioxidant capacity of mouse liver and prevention of liver damage Alcohol intake could cause oxidative stress in hepatocytes, leading to the depletion of glutathione (GSH). In addition, the presence of acetaldehyde could also inhibit the production of GSH (Cenesiz, Devrim, Kamber, & Sozmen, 2008). Therefore, the reduction of GSH content was considered as a prominent feature of alcoholic liver injury (Gajski, Domijan, & Garaj-Vrhovac, 2012). As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the GSH content in liver tissue was significantly lower in the MG group than that in the NCG group. However, the mice treated with noni fruit or fermented juice resulted in a significant increase in the GSH content in the liver, which attenuated the oxidative stress in the hepatocytes. The acetaldehyde could not only decrease the level of GSH, but also increase the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), which was a marker of cellular peroxidation damage (Qu, Li, Wang, & Chen, 2008). In the noni fruit and fermented juice groups (except 180d-FJ), the MDA was reduced to the levels comparable to that in the PCG group and the reduction of MDA content decrease lipid peroxidation, thus decreasing the extent of liver cell damage (Su et al., 2003). Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) are considered as the major enzymes in the antioxidant defense system (Olsvik et al., 2005; Wang, Chen, & Zhang, 2002). Reduction of these enzyme activities could accumulate free radicals and aggravate and the damages to liver cells. As shown in Fig. 8 , the consumption of noni fruit and fermented noni juice increased the activity of GSH-PX and CAT to a comparable level to that in the PCG group, but had no effect on the levels of SOD. Thus, the consumption of noni fruit or fermented juice maintained equilibrium between the oxidation–reduction state in the liver, and may be able to alleviate the liver damage caused by one-time heavy alcohol consumption."
17,Histopathological studies,"3.5 Histopathological studies The same sections of liver from mice in each group were embedded in paraffin and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for pathological examination (Ohsawa et al., 2013). As shown in Fig. 9 , the liver cells of the mice from the NCG were structurally intact, and the structure of the hepatic lobule was clear. There were no observable fatty vesicles, and there was no necrosis or inflammation on hepatocytes (Wang et al., 2012) (Fig. 8A). Due to alcohol intake, many small fat cavities were apparent in the liver cells of mice from the MG, in addition to the presence of inflammatory cells. The hepatocyte line and the hepatic lobule structure were also destroyed in these sections (Fig. 8B). In the PCG, the degree of alcohol-induced liver injury was considerably attenuated compared to that of the MG mice. The structure of the hepatic lobule and hepatic cells in this group was clear, and there were no obvious fatty vesicles or inflammatory cells (Fig. 8C). The pathological damage of the liver was alleviated in the fermented noni juice groups, and almost no obvious fatty vesicles were observed. The inflammation in the liver cells was negligible, and the structure of hepatic lobule remained intact (Fig. 8D–J). In particular, the liver cells of the group fed fermented noni juice contained no obvious fatty vesicles and no inflammatory cells were observed. However, the hepatic cell cord structure was ambiguous, but this did not appear to cause liver damage in mice. Based on the pathological section of the mice liver tissues, the noni fruit and fermented juice had a preventive effect on liver damage caused by the intake of a large amount of alcohol. However, fermented noni juice (>one year) showed a reduced ability to prevent acute alcohol induced liver injury."
18,Discussion,"Acute alcohol-induced liver injury is caused by the consumption of a large amount of alcohol at one time. In severe cases, it may badly affect the liver and even lead to liver cancer. Noni juice is a kind of fermented beverage with high nutritional value, which is made from fresh noni fruit by natural fermentation. In this paper, the antioxidant capacity of noni fruit and fermented noni fruit juice was evaluated by studying their effect on DPPH free radical system, hydroxyl radical system and total reducing power system in an In vitro trial. The results showed that fresh noni fruit had strong antioxidant capacity. With the prolongation of fermentation time, the antioxidant capacity decreased gradually. Consistent with our results, previous reports have found that fermented noni juice noni had stronger antioxidant capacity than noni fruit (Min, 2009; Yang et al., 2007). It has been reported that polyphenols were the main functional components of fermented noni juices responsible for the antioxidant activity (Hanqiao, Chi, Lu, & Jianguo, 2016) and there was a significant dose–effect relationship between the content of polyphenols and the antioxidant activity (Mayilmurugan, Sankaralingam, Suresh, & Palaniandavar, 2010). A decrease in the anti-oxidant activity may be correlated with the oxidation of plant polyphenols, which are more susceptible to oxidation during the fermentation. The phenolic hydroxyl groups dissociate to form oxygen anions, and further lose hydrogen to form orthoquinones, leading to reduced antioxidant activity (Lijiang, Ying, & Bi, 2000). After alcohol consumption, 90–95% of ethanol undergoes oxidative metabolism in the liver with the participation of alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Alcohol can be converted into acetaldehyde, which is then converted into acetic acid by the action of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetic acid enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) in the form of acetaminophen coenzyme A to complete the alcohol metabolism process. The activities of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT in serum can be used as indicators for early liver damage and noni juice displayed protective effects to reduce the liver damages. Previous studies also reported an increase in the activity of ALT and AST, which are transaminases in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of specialized liver cells (hepatocyte) and can reflect the severity of hepatocyte injury (Yang, 2011). In this study, the effects of noni fruit and fermented noni juice on the contents of TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C in mice were also evaluated. According to the previous report (Robinson & Quarfordt, 2010), another complication of acute alcoholic liver injury was abnormal lipid metabolism. Metabolites in alcohol metabolism lead to increased triglyceride synthesis, reduction of fat transport function, and blockage of the synthesis and secretion of lipoprotein, which ultimately increased the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C, and reduced the levels of HDL-C in the liver of rats. In addition, the decreased HDL-C may result in hyperlipidemia and fatty liver. Therefore, the levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C can reflect the status of lipid metabolism. Previous studies have shown that PPAR-α played an important role in regulating lipid metabolism and natural antioxidants (such as docosahexaenoic acid, extra virgin olive oil and hydroxytyrosol) can prevent liver steatosis induced by a high-fat diet by regulating PPAR-α and Nrf2 (Barrera et al., 2018; Hernandez-Rodas et al., 2017; Valenzuela et al., 2017). The results indicated that noni fruit and fermented noni juice can regulate TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C levels and restore lipid metabolism, which may be related to the activation of PPAR-α (Hernandez-Rodas et al., 2017; Valenzuela et al., 2017) and further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. Oxidative stress is a key factor in the injury mechanism of alcoholic liver disease. Alcohol aggravates oxidative stress by increasing reactive oxygen species and consuming antioxidants. Under normal physiological conditions, various antioxidants present in the cells, such as superoxide dismutase, gluten, vitamin E, etc., can promptly remove harmful free radicals in the body. At this time, the generation and elimination of free radicals are in dynamic equilibrium, and free radicals do not have a significant adverse effect on the body. As a result of excessive alcohol intake, the body loses the balance between the generation and elimination of free radicals. The excessive production of active oxygen species surpasses the capacity of the body to produce enough antioxidants to eliminate active oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and cell damage. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays an important role in regulating the oxidative stress response induced by alcohol and has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which can inhibit the inflammatory response caused by oxidative stress (Kobayashi & Yamamoto, 2005). By referencing Eman and Mohamed, GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, and MDA were selected as five activity indicators to determine the protective effects of noni fruit and fermented fruit juice on acute alcoholic liver injury (Eman & Mohamed, 2014). Noni fruit and fermented noni juice increased the activities of GSH-PX and CAT in the liver, indicating that the oxidative stress was resisted and the antioxidant defense status was enhanced (Eman et al., 2018). According to the histological analysis, liver sections of the MG group showed significant liver lesions, including hepatic lobular inflammation and hepatocyte enlargement. Fermented noni juice repaired the related pathological damage of the liver tissue, indicating that fermented noni juice displayed protective effect in case of alcohol-induced liver injury. The findings were in accordance with Yang (Yang, 2011). In addition, we found that the protective effects of fermented noni juice were dependent on the fermentation times. However, the potential molecular mechanisms were not revealed in current study. Future studies on the immunohistochemistry of inflammatory markers and apoptotic proteins are required to deeply understand the mechanism of prevention."
19,Conclusions,"In this study, the in vitro antioxidant activity of noni fruit and fermented noni juice were investigated, and an acute alcohol-induced liver injury model was successfully established. Fresh noni fruit had higher antioxidant capacities than did fermented noni juice. However, fermented noni juice had a more comprehensive preventive effect on acute liver injury induced by alcohol, based on the measurements of markers of hepatic function and structural integrity. These findings highlight the potential application of noni juice as hepatoprotective candidate.
