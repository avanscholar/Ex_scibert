0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is a promising approach for solar energy conversion [1,2]. Powdered system based on semiconductors is the simplest water-splitting system that is more amenable to cheap, large-scale production of H2 [3–8]. Nevertheless, the oxidation of water severely restricts the efficiency of overall water splitting due to its sluggish kinetics and endergonic thermodynamics [9,10]. Furthermore, the product of water oxidation, O2, is not of significant value and always detrimental to the hydrogen evolution reaction [11]. Besides water splitting, an overlooked approach for solar energy conversion is producing H2 from alternative sources such as abundant biomass [12,13]. These reactions are generally easier in kinetics (2e−/2H+ coupled process), require less activation energy and yield easily separated and high-value products [14]. Among them, selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to aldehydes by visible light is of great significance in both laboratorial and industrial scale [15–17]. At present, classical aldehydes production reactions are still employed in the presence of organic solvents, hazardous oxidants and high pressure/temperature [11]. Therefore, a green synthetic route is urgently necessary. Inspired by various types of enzymes in the organism, which are capable to perform highly selective and efficient oxidation of organic molecules, transition-metal complexes are considered as good candidates to catalyze selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols. As a result, significant progresses have been made in constructing molecular catalysts based system with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2′-bipyridine) as the photosensitizer [18–21]. However, the narrow absorption spectrum, easily photo-induced decomposition and expensive features of ruthenium make [Ru(bpy)3]2+ almost impossible towards large scale application. Instead, semiconductors possess the characteristics of wide and continuous absorption spectrum, outstanding stability and popular price. So incorporation of the efficient transition-metal complexes with photoactive semiconductors is an ideal approach. To date, little research effort has been made based on this concept and most of them are performed in the presence of sacrificial reagent [22,23], which impedes the sustainable way of converting solar energy into chemical fuels. Moreover, the utilization of organic solvent and acidic solution are not environmentally benign [24]. Therefore, a high-selective and stable photocatalytic system able to simultaneously oxidize benzyl alcohols and produce H2 in pure water is preferable. As a proof-or-concept, we present here the combination of a ruthenium molecular catalyst and platinum particle modified graphitic carbon nitride (Pt-g-C3N4) for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols coupled with H2 evolution in pure water under visible light irradiation. The experimental results reveal that the introduction of Ru catalyst plays an essential role in improving the selectivity of benzyl alcohols oxidation in this hybrid system."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Organic substrates such as benzyl alcohol, 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol and cyclohexanol as well as the corresponding aldehydes were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation and used without further purification. Ultra-pure water (18.2MΩcm−1) for all the reactions was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Direct-Q 3 UV). All other chemicals are commercially available. SEM micrographs were obtained by using a Nova NanoSEM 450 instrument. TEM images were conducted with FEI TF30 equipment. X-ray diffraction was collected with a D/max-2400 diffractometer. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra measurement was performed on an Evolution 200 spectrophotometer (Thermo, USA). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Fisher 6700 spectrometer, and the samples were prepared as KBr tablets. 1H NMR spectrum was recorded at 298K using a Bruker DRX-400 instrument operating at 400MHz. UV–vis absorption measurement was taken with an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. Steady-state and time resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed by use of nanosecond flash-photolysis system (LP920, Edinburgh Instruments)."
3,Preparation of Pt-g-C3N4,"2.2 Preparation of Pt-g-C3N4 g-C3N4 was prepared according to the protocol reported in literature [25]. In brief, a set amount of precursor (urea, dicyandiamide (DCDA), thiourea and cyanamide) was put in a lidded high quality alumina crucible, then placed inside a muffle furnace and heated with a heating rate of 2°C/min, and finally held at the target temperature 530°C for 2h in the air flow. The resultant powders were used directly without other treatment. Pt cocatalyst was deposited onto g-C3N4 using a photodeposition method. Stock solutions of ultra-pure water and H2PtCl6·6H2O were made beforehand and then added according to the required weight of metal (1wt% was found to be the optimal loading for Pt). Photodeposition reaction was performed in 100mL water:methanol (9:1, v/v) solution containing 100mg g-C3N4 and certain amount of Pt, the reactor was sealed and purged with Ar gas for 30min, then irradiated for 1h under full arc irradiation using a 300W Xe lamp. The photocatalyst was then filtered and washed three times with water, finally dried at 70°C under vacuum for overnight."
4,Synthesis of [Ru(tpa)(H2O)2](PF6)2,"2.3 Synthesis of [Ru(tpa)(H2O)2](PF6)2 This complex was synthesized according to the literature’s method with some modification. Briefly, to a refluxed solution of RuCl3·3H2O (0.20g, 0.764mmol) in ethanol (30mL) was added TPA ligand (0.222g, 0.764mmol). After refluxing for 10min, 20mL of an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (0.39g, 2.294mmol) was added. The mixture was then refluxed for 24h, and the precipitate was removed by filtration. Then a small amount of saturated NH4PF6 solution was added to the filtrate dropwise and the precipitate was collected by filtration. After washing with ether and drying under vacuum, a dark green solid was obtained. Yield: 0.2g (35%). 1H NMR (400MHz, CD3CN): δ 4.25 (s, 2H), 4.70 and 4.99 (ABq, 4H), 6.82 (d, 1H), 6.87 (t, 2H), 6.97 (t, 1H), 7.33 (t, 1H), 7.43 (d, 2H), 7.67 (t, 2H), 8.41 (d, 2H), 8.80 (d, 1H)."
5,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.4 Photocatalytic experiments Photocatalytic dehydrogenation reactions were performed in a 50mL Schlenk bottle with 10mL pure water containing 10mg Pt-g-C3N4 photocatalyst, 0.08mM RuCat and 10mM corresponding alcohols. The reactor was sealed, degassed with Ar gas for 30min and then irradiated by a 300W Xe lamp equipped with a cutoff filter (λ>400nm). The temperature of the reaction system was maintained by a custom-built jacketed cooler. The generated H2 in the headspace was analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography (Techcomp GC 7890T, Ar carrier gas, Thermo Conductivity Detector). When reaction finished, the resultant solution was centrifuged and the supernatant was extracted with 3×10mL CH2Cl2 and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. Then the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to ca. 3mL, the product was analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography (Agilent GC 6890N, N2 carrier gas, Flame Ionization Detector). Dodecane was selected as the internal standard to quantify the converted alcohols and generated aldehydes. In addition, 1H NMR spectroscopy was also adopted for characterizing and quantifying the organic products. The conversion and selectivity efficiency was calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) Conversion ( % ) = n i n i t i a l a l c o h o l − n r e s i d u a l a l c o h o l n i n i t i a l a l c o h o l × 100 % (2) Selectivity ( % ) = n p r o d u c e d a l d e h y d e n i n i t i a l a l c o h o l − n r e s i d u a l a l c o h o l × 100 % Apparent quantum yield (AQY) was defined as the ratio between the number of collected carriers and the number of all the incident photons on the device active area at a given wavelength. It could be calculated according to the following equation: (3) AQY % = 2 n H 2 ⋅ N A ⋅ h ⋅ c I ⋅ λ ⋅ A ⋅ t ⋅ 100 Where nH2 is the moles of photogenerated H2, N A is Avogadro’s constant (6.02×1023 mol−1), h is the Planck constant (6.63×10−34 Js), c is the speed of light (3×108 ms−1), I is the light intensity, λ is the wavelength of incident monochromatic light, A is the cross-sectional area of irradiation and t is the irradiation time."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Photocatalytic performance of Pt-g-C3N4 composite,"3.1 Photocatalytic performance of Pt-g-C3N4 composite The discovery of g-C3N4 as a metal-free photocatalyst by Wang et al. has stimulated intensive research in the application this two-dimensional conjugated polymer [26–31]. g-C3N4 has suitable valence and conduction band positions for either water splitting or CO2 reduction [3,25,32–34]. In addition, the g-C3N4-based materials have also been found to act as photocatalysts for organic redox synthesis [35–37]. The well positioned band edges make it the best candidate for coupling benzyl alcohols oxidation with proton reduction. At the beginning of our research, Pt doped g-C3N4 (Pt-g-C3N4) was used as the photocatalyst for 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (MBA) oxidation. Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in 10mL water containing Pt-g-C3N4 (10mg) and MBA (0.1mmol), the light source was a 300W Xe lamp equipped with a 400nm cut-off filter. The g-C3N4 was prepared with different precursors (urea, dicyandiamide (DCDA), thiourea and melamine) according to the reported protocols [25], in which urea derived g-C3N4 exhibited the best activity towards alcohols dehydrogenation (Fig. S3). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, powdered X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and UV–vis diffuse reflectance (DRS) spectrum of urea based g-C3N4 agreed well with the literature’s data (Figs. , S1 and S2). As shown in Fig. S4a, the H2 and 4-methoxybenzyl aldehyde (MBAd) yields increased with the loading of Pt up to 1wt%, more Pt loading resulted in the decreased activity probably due to the aggregation of Pt which reduces light absorption. On the contrary, preliminary kinetic investigations suggest that the reaction rate is almost zero order with respect to the amount of Pt-g-C3N4, so 10mg of Pt-g-C3N4 was used in photocatalysis to run the reaction in a relatively well-dispersed solution (Fig. S4b). The results of photocatalytic dehydrogenation with different alcohols are summarized in Table 1 . Compared with the unsubstituted benzyl alcohol (BA), alcohols bearing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing functional groups exhibited better conversion and H2 yields (Table 1, Entries 2–4), but the selectivities for aldehydes were unsatisfactory. Especially for MBA, only 51% selectivity was obtained after irradiation for 20h (Table 1, Entry 2). In addition, the oxidation of other alcohols such as chnnamyl alcohol and cyclohexanol were also available in the current system (Table 1, Entries 5–6). Both of them were able to be transformed into the corresponding aldehydes together with H2 evolution smoothly. Likewise, only moderate selectivity was obtained. To gain more information about the poor selectivity, the reaction of MBA dehydrogenation was monitored for a reaction period of 20h, with a detailed analysis of reaction intermediates/products and the carbon balance (Fig. 2 ). This investigation shows the selectivity of MBAd was declining across the entire reaction period. The over-oxidation of MBA to 4-methoxy-benzoic acid and CO2 occurred and the amounts of byproducts increased with the reaction time. Carbon balance shows that there is no other byproduct generated during the reaction period. Based on these results, the poor selectivity for aldehyde is due to the strong oxidative nature of photogenerated holes."
8,Feasibility study of combining g-C3N4 photocatalyst and RuCat,"3.2 Feasibility study of combining g-C3N4 photocatalyst and RuCat To improve the selectivity of benzyl alcohols’ oxidation, a molecular catalyst [Ru(tpa)(H2O)2]2+ (RuCat, tpa=tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine) that is well-studied in catalytic conversion of alcohol to aldehyde was chosen to incorporate with Pt-g-C3N4 [19,22,38]. By comparing the redox potentials of g-C3N4 and RuCat (Fig. 3 a), photo-generated holes were anticipated to transfer from g-C3N4 to RuCat and produce Ru(IV)=O intermediate, which is highly active for the selective oxidation of alcohol. The formation of the high-valent Ru(IV)=O species was evidenced by UV–vis spectroscopy. In detail, a reaction sample containing RuCat and Pt-g-C3N4 was irradiated for 10min, g-C3N4 was removed and the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the resulting solution was recorded. As shown in Fig. 3b, the band at 620nm greatly decreases and a new absorption band (shoulder) at 470nm appears. According to our previous study, this new absorption band was ascribed to the formation of Ru(IV)=O species [22]. To gain more insights into the charge transfer process between g-C3N4 and RuCat, steady state photoluminescence (PL) experiment was performed. Excited at 340nm, the luminescence of g-C3N4 was largely quenched upon the addition of RuCat, indicating that charge transfer between g-C3N4 and RuCat could greatly suppress the radiative electron-hole recombination (Fig. 3c). On the contrary, the emission of g-C3N4 was almost unaffected upon adding MBA. In addition, the charge transfer process was investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). As shown in Fig. 3d of the fitting results, the average lifetime of g-C3N4 and RuCat/g-C3N4 samples is 1.8 and 0.39ns, respectively. Clearly, RuCat/g-C3N4 mixture has much shorter PL lifetimes and better electron migration capacity, which was believed to highly facilitate photocatalytic reaction."
9,Photocatalytic performance of Pt-g-C3N4/RuCat hybrid system,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance of Pt-g-C3N4/RuCat hybrid system Having confirmed the formation of Ru(IV)=O and efficient charge transfer between RuCat and g-C3N4, the performance of photocatalytic oxidation of MBA by RuCat/Pt-g-C3N4 was evaluated. After irradiated under continuous stirring for 10h, MBAd was almost exclusively generated and hydrogen was simultaneously produced without any oxygen evolution (Table 2 , entry 7). Gas chromatography and 1H NMR spectra showed essentially no acid or CO2 generation (Fig. S6). Control experiments confirmed that no MBAd or H2 could be detected in the absence of Pt-g-C3N4, light or loaded Pt, indicating each component is indispensible for efficient photocatalysis (Table 2, entry 1–4). However, the RuCat free system only attained 66% selectivity in the same reaction period (Table 2, entry 6). The adsorption of RuCat on Pt-g-C3N4 could be well described by the Freundlich equation (Fig. S5), indicating 54% of Ru complex was adsorbed under equilibrium condition, which is far exceeding the amount based on normal physical adsorption. This was considered as a result of the electrostatic interaction between positively charged RuCat and Pt-g-C3N4 whose surface are negative charged. Evidently, the negatively charged surface of carbon nitride was supported by a Zeta potential of −21.7mV under the reaction conditions. Based on the amount of absorbed RuCat, a turnover number (TON) of 107 was obtained for MBAd production. This value is almost 4-fold larger than that of a previous system using molecular photosensitizers [39]. However, the lack of Pt particles only attained 9% conversion efficiency, which demonstrated the significance of Pt loading in enhancing the activity of photocatalytic reaction (Table 2, entry 5). By extending the reaction period from 10 to 20h, a higher conversion with a TON of 144 was obtained with a slightly decreased selectivity (91%, Table 2, entry 8), which might be ascribed to the partial decomposition of molecular catalyst during long-term irradiation. In agreement with this assumption, a decreased selectivity was observed by reducing the concentration of RuCat to half (Table 2, entry 10). It is notable that the selectivities achieved in the presence of RuCat were far better than that of RuCat free system (51%, Table 2, entry 9), highlighting the essential role of molecular catalyst on selectivity improvement. However, the reaction rate of alcohol dehydrogenation in the hybrid system was not as fast as that of molecular catalyst free system, which might be ascribed to different pathways for alcohol oxidation mediated by either high-valent Ru(IV)=O or photogenerated holes. With MBA as the substrate, the yields of MBAd and H2 exhibited linear increase with the illumination period, however, kept constant when the light was off (Fig. S7), confirming that the generation of MBAd and H2 was due to the photoinduced MBA oxidation. The dependence of this hybrid system on the wavelength of incident light was also investigated. As depicted in Fig. 4 a, the tendency of H2 production corresponds well with the absorbance spectrum of g-C3N4 photocatalyst. Meanwhile, the selectivity of MBAd generation is reduced when the reaction performed at wavelength less than 400nm. This illustrates the importance of visible light rather than UV light towards selective chemical conversion. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of RuCat/Pt-g-C3N4 system was tested at 400nm with different concentrations of MBA. As shown in Fig. 4b, the AQY based on MBAd exhibits first order with respect to the concentration of MBA and reaches 0.28% when 0.1M substrate used. The stability test showed that the Pt-g-C3N4 composite can be re-used without apparent loss in both conversion and selectivity for at least five consecutive runs (Fig. S8). This can, in principle, be explained by the robust chemical inertness and the excellent stability of g-C3N4 towards photocorrosion. In addition, XRD, FTIR and SEM analyses of used Pt-g-C3N4 photocatalyst showed no obvious change after five reaction cycles (Figs. S9 and S10). Encouraged by these results, photocatalytic reactions were extended to other aromatic alcohols. As shown in Table S1, all substrates were selectively transformed with the selectivity for aldehyde significantly higher (>90%) than that of RuCat free system. Specifically, the unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds of cinnamyl alcohol were well maintained during the photocatalytic generation of aldehyde (Table S1, entry 4)."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, we present here a hybrid photocatalytic system containing a molecular catalyst and Pt particle modified g-C3N4 for simultaneous oxidation of benzyl alcohols and production of H2. It is remarkable that the incorporation of RuCat dramatically improves the selectivity towards aldehydes production due to the formation of highly active Ru(IV)=O intermediate. UV–vis and PL spectroscopy evidenced that the photogenerated holes are transfered from carbon nitride to molecular catalyst rather than the substrate, thus initiates metal-based selective oxidation. These findings bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysis towards organic synthesis that utilize sunlight energy. The advantage of molecular catalyst in directly tuning the selectivity of photocatalytic organic transformation in a semiconductor-molecular hybrid system is promising, which has not been reported in previous studies. Attempt to extend the current system to other organic transformation reactions is now underway in our laboratory."
