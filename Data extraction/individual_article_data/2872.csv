0,Introduction,"Solar energy is a promising potential alternative to current fossil fuels because it is clean and almost inexhaustible. The most direct method utilizing solar energy is to split water into H2 and O2 gas on the surface of adequate photocatalysts, which should have proper band gap so as to absorb sunlight energy [1]. Over the past few decades, a wide range of semiconductor photocatalysts [2,3] have been studied in lab such as TiO2 [4–9], CdS [10–12], PdS [13], ZnCdS [14,15], ZnO [16], BiVO4 [17–20] and g-C3N4 [21–23] and so on. However, there are few catalysts that meet industrial requirements currently (such as stability, low cost, high catalytic activity, environmental friendliness, etc.). Titanium dioxide (TiO2) was first discovered and used as a photocatalyst to decompose water to produce hydrogen and oxygen in 1972. It is regarded as the most promising candidate for future application in energy due to its chemical stability, low cost, nontoxity and versatility. However, TiO2 has a large band gap and can only absorb ultraviolet light, and its absorption ability to sunlight is not strong. Therefore, actualization of visible light absorption is particularly important in TiO2 modification, and many researchers have made modification to prestine TiO2 to make enhance its light adsorption and improve hole-electron separation efficiency. Various strategies have been brought out to improve the activity of TiO2, such as constructing heterojunction with other semiconductors [24,25] as well as loading Noble metal cocatalyst and non-noble metal cocatalysts to synthesis of composite materials [26–32]. Noble metal cocatalysts (Pt [33], Ag [34,35] and Au [36,37]) have been chosen to be loaded on TiO2 to enhance the photocatalytic activity in photocatalytic water splitting in many reports. It is well known that noble metal promoters can bring high performance, but it is very expensive and unrealistic in future industrial use. On the other hand, non-noble metal cocatalysts (CuO [38], Cu2O [39], MoS2 [40], CuS [41], Cu [42], Cu(OH)2 [43] and etc.) are more attractive, because they have comparable hydrogen production performance as noble metal promoters, while the low cost is beneficial to realize the industrialization of photocatalytic hydrogen production in the future. Loading effective non-noble metal cocatalysts could also broaden the spectrum responding range of the photocatalyst and promote the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes. For example, it was reported that H2 evolution rate on commercial P25 was greatly improved due to loading of Cu(OH)2 [44]. Recently, 2D materials have shown their great potentials in photocatalytic applications due to their high specific surface areas, short carriers migration distance, tunable exposed lattice plane and resistance to aggolomeration [45]. As to TiO2, 2D TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) plane present higher photocatalytic performance than commercial P25 for their unique structural features giving plenty active sites for photocatalytic reactions [46]. Further studies showed that the coexistence of (001) and (101) facets can promote the separation of charge carriers on TiO2. In this work, TiO2 nanosheets with uniform morphology and even dispersion were synthesized by simple hydrothermal method using HF as the shape control agent. Compared with the published samples (TiO2 nanotubes and nanosheets) [43,44], the synthesized TiO2 nanosheets are in uniform size and regular distribution, and the morphology of TiO2 did not change after the formation of the composite catalyst. At the same time, the 0D/2D structure has been successfully synthesized by loading Cu(OH)2 on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets. The prepared Cu-TiO2 was used as a catalyst to facilitate photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction under 500 W Xe lamp. The performance tests showed that the photocatalytic hydrogen production on TiO2 was augmented after modification of Cu(OH)2. In effect, the hydrogen production of the composite catalyst is 8.3 times that of pure TiO2. The improvement not only owes much to the fact that the TiO2 nanosheets have a large specific surface area which provides sufficient reaction sites for the catalysis, but is also due to the modification that realize the expansion of the absorption spectrum range and the improvement of the photoelectron-hole separation efficiency. Finally, the probable mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen production was put forward."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All reagents were analytical regents and purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China."
3,"Preparation of TiO2 nanosheets, Cu(OH)2 and Cu(OH)2-TiO2(Cu-TiO2)","2.2 Preparation of TiO2 nanosheets, Cu(OH)2 and Cu(OH)2-TiO2(Cu-TiO2) Preparation of TiO2 nanosheets: 20 mL Ti(OBu)4 and 3.2 mL HF (40%) were added dropwise into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave under magnetic stirring for 30 min to form a solution. The resulting solution was kept in electric drying oven at 200 °C for 24 h before the white precipitation was collected and washed using water and ethyl alcohol alternately for 3–4 times. Finally, the TiO2 nanosheets powders were dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Preparation of Cu(OH)2: dissolving 0.6 g NaOH in 180 mL deionized water to form a clear and transparent solution, then added 0.02 M Cu(NO3)2 to the above transparent solution. After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the mixture was then washed with distilled water and ethanol, which was dried at 30 °C for 12 h finally. Preparation of Cu(OH)2-TiO2: 0.2 g as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets and 0.6 g NaOH were dispersed in 180 mL water and magnetic stirred for 30 min to form a solution, which was then subject to ultrasonic processing for 30 min. Then, different volume of 0.02 M Cu(NO3)2 solutions were added dropwise into the above-mentioned mixture solution under stirring constantly, and maintained at room temperature for 3 h. The solid product was collected and washed by water and ethyl alcohol for 3–4 times before dried at 30 °C for 24 h. Finally, the as-prepared different Cu-TiO2 samples were denoted as 0.7Cu-TiO2, 1Cu-TiO2, 2Cu-TiO2, 3Cu-TiO2 respectively, in which the number means the weight ratio of Cu-TiO2 (mCu(OH)2/mTiO2 × 100% = 0.7%, 1%, 2%, 3%)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The surface morphology of the products was observed using the JSM-6701E scanning electron microscope (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained from a TECNAI G2 F20, America FEI. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples were acquired on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer D/MAX-2200/PC equipped with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 20 mA). UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of all samples was carried out at room temperature using a PuXinTU-1901 spectrophotometer over the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. The reflectance spectra were transformed to absorption intensity using the Kubelka–Munk method. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were recorded at room temperature under a 325 nm excitation wavelength with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PE, LS-55). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of as-obtained samples was implemented at open circuit potential with a 0.01 V amplitude perturbation between 100 kHz and 0.1 Hz on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CHI Shanghai), the light source is 500 W Xenon lamp (Lancheng XQ-500, China)."
5,Photocatalytic activity measurement,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurement 0.1 g photocatalyst was dispersed in 60 mL water and 20 mL methyl alcohol as the sacrificial reagents, then transferred to a Pyrex photoreactor under the vertically irradiation of a 500 W Xenon lamp (Lancheng XQ-500, China). The amount of H2 evolution was tested using an online gas chromatography system (QC-9101, 5 Å-coloum), in which a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) is equiped and Ar gas is used as carrier gas. The cycle stability test is the same as the measurement of photocatalytic activity. The photocatalyst was used repeatedly every 4 h by centrifuge, then applied to the next cycle test."
6,Electrode preparation,"2.5 Electrode preparation A uniformly dispersed sample (10 mg catalyst, 2 mL of ethanol) was dropped on the FTO glass to form a film which was dried to an area of about 1.0 cm2. Then, the photoelectric characteristics were tested under irradiation with an LED lamp (CEL-LED 100) in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 7.5) electrolyte solution under a bias of 0.5 V. The three-electrode system also included Pt wire and Ag/AgCl was used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively, and the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale: ERHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.059 pH."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Cu-TiO2 crystal and morphology structure,"3.1 Cu-TiO2 crystal and morphology structure Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD patterns of the pure TiO2 and xCu-TiO2 composites, where the “x” represents 0.7%, 1%, 2% and 3% (mCu(OH)2/mTiO2 × 100% = 0.7%, 1%, 2% and 3%). All peaks of pure TiO2 can be indexed to anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272), and no other phase was detected. The peak intensity of Cu-TiO2 composites gradually decreases with increasing the amount of Cu(OH)2, which is attributed to low crystallinity of Cu(OH)2 [47–49]. And it can be seen that the positions of the Cu-TiO2 diffraction peaks and the TiO2 diffraction peaks are the same, indicating that the crystal structure of TiO2 is not changed after loading Cu(OH)2. The diffraction peak of Cu(OH)2 does not appear in Fig. 1(a) because the amount of loading is too small. Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD patterns of the pure Cu(OH)2 (JCPDS No.13-0420). The morphology features of pure TiO2 and Cu-TiO2 nanosheets were observed by SEM in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2(a and b), the pure TiO2 nanosheet has a uniform size and a smooth surface. As shown in Fig. 2(c and d), the morphology of the composite catalyst does not change after loading Cu(OH)2. Cu(OH)2 is a small-sized particle attached to the TiO2 surface, so the combination of Cu(OH)2 and TiO2 is not visible in the SEM images, and the combination of the two can be seen in the latter TEM images. In Fig. 3 , different elements have been marked with different colors. It can be observed that the elemental mappings of Ti and O are similar in shape and the distribution is very uniform, which indicates that the TiO2 base material has been successfully formed. At the same time, Cu element was also detected and distributed evenly on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets. This shows that Cu(OH)2 and TiO2 coexist in the composite material, indicating the successful preparation of composite 2Cu-TiO2. In addition, no other impurity elements were detected in the elemental analysis. From Fig. 4 , the morphology of pure TiO2 nanosheets and composite 2Cu-TiO2 can be observed. It can be seen from Fig. 4(a and b) that the pure TiO2 nanosheets are regular sheet shape and evenly distributed, the uniformly distributed sheet shape is favorable for the exposure of the active sites, providing more active sites for the reaction. It can be seen from (c) that the nano-small particles of Cu(OH)2 are supported on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets. In comparison with the image of pure TiO2 nanosheets in Fig. 4 (a), it is proved that Cu(OH)2 and TiO2 have been successfully combined, and the composite catalyst has been successfully prepared. In Fig. 4(d), the lattice fringes of d = 0.35 nm and d = 0.37 nm can be clearly seen. By comparing different lattice spacings with XRD of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272) and Cu(OH)2 (JCPDS No. 13-0420), it can be found the lattice fringes of d = 0.35 nm and d = 0.37 nm represent the (101) crystal plane of TiO2 and the (021) crystal plane of Cu(OH)2, respectively, further suggesting that the Cu/TiO2 complex has been successfully prepared. The EDX diagram of 2Cu-TiO2 is shown in Fig. 5 , from which the characteristic peaks of the elements of O, Ti, Cu, and Ni can be found. The characteristic peaks of Ti and O are much higher than that of Cu because TiO2 was used as a base material in 2Cu-TiO2. On the contrary, Cu has a weak peak since only 2% Cu is loaded. The coexistence of the characteristic peaks of three elements of O, Ti, and Cu demonstrated that the composite material was successfully prepared. However, there is a high characteristic peak of Ni element in the test result, which is due to the use of nickel mesh in the preparation of the test EDX sample. A series of photoelectric tests were carried out to verify the improvement led by the combination. Fig. 6 (a) shows the UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the prepared samples. The results show that with the increase of Cu(OH)2 content, the absorption edge of 1Cu-TiO2, 2Cu-TiO2 and 3Cu-TiO2 composites are red-shifted and the absorption of visible light is enhanced. The band gap of the composite is narrowed after the Cu(OH)2 loaded and the light absorption efficiency is enhanced [50]. As can be seen in Fig. 6 (b), the band gap of pure TiO2 is 3.2 eV, while the band gap of 2Cu-TiO2 is only 3.12 eV. The photocatalytic H2 production rate of all samples were exhibited in Fig. 7 (a), from which it can be observed that compared with pure TiO2, the hydrogen production rate of the composite catalyst is obviously improved after loading Cu(OH)2. Specifically, when the loading of Cu(OH)2 is 1%, the hydrogen production of 1Cu-TiO2 composite is significantly higher than that of pure TiO2. When the loading of Cu(OH)2 reaches 2%, the hydrogen production rate is up to 1994 μmol/h/g, which is about 8.3 times of pure TiO2. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate gradually attenuates when the Cu(OH)2 loading amount further increases to 3%. This phenomenon can be explained that loading of Cu(OH)2 can enhance the light absorption and promote the charge separation efficiency of the photocatalyst. However, the energy of incident light may also be shielded from reaching the underlying TiO2 catalyst due to excessive loading of Cu(OH)2 cocatalyst. As a result, the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production reach to the climax at 2% Cu(OH)2 loading amount. Fig. 7(b) shows the hydrogen production cycle performance test of 2Cu-TiO2. It is illustrated that the amount of hydrogen produced gradually decreased in the second and third runs, which is due to the loss of photocatalyst in the centrifugation step [41]. Since the photoelectric properties and the PL intensity of the samples can reflect the electron transport in the photocatalytic process, the performance of the composite catalyst can be roughly judged by testing the photoelectric properties of the catalysts. Fig. 8 (a) is the photocurrent comparison diagram of the catalysts. It can be seen from Fig. 8(a) that the transient photocurrent responses of 1Cu-TiO2, 2Cu-TiO2, and 3Cu-TiO2 are significantly improved as compared with pure TiO2. Among them, the transient photocurrent responses of 2Cu-TiO2 is the highest, indicating Cu(OH)2 and the photoinduced charge of the complex after TiO2 binding is better than that of TiO2 during the reaction. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to analyze the charge transfer process of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the EIS Nyquist curves of composites such as 1Cu-TiO2, 2Cu-TiO2 and 3Cu-TiO2 is lower than that of pure TiO2 under illumination conditions, wherein the EIS Nyquist curves of 2Cu-TiO2 is the smallest when the ratio is 2%, indicating that the photoelectron transport of 2Cu-TiO2 is faster than that of pure TiO2 during the reaction. This result further proved that loading Cu(OH)2 onto TiO2 nanosheets has an outstanding effect on improving the composite’s photocatalytic activity [51]. From Fig. 8(a and b), it can be seen that the results of transient photocurrent and EIS test are corresponding. The smaller impedance and the larger transient photocurrent can reflect the enhanced electron transfer during the reaction in the composite photoelectrode. The photogenerated electrons in 2Cu-TiO2 are transported faster, that is to say, the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in 2Cu-TiO2 becomes larger, indicating that the strategy of forming 2Cu-TiO2 composite catalyst is feasible. As shown in Fig. 8(c), the PL test was performed at an excitation wavelength of 220 nm to investigate the transfer behavior of photo-induced carries of pure TiO2 and carriers of different ratios of Cu-TiO2. It can be seen that the PL intensity of 1Cu-TiO2, 2Cu-TiO2 and 3Cu-TiO2 composites is lower than that of pure TiO2, indicating that the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes of Cu-TiO2 composite decreases after its combination with Cu(OH)2. Among them, 2Cu-TiO2 composite has the lowest PL intensity and the slowest rate photogenerated electrons [52]. Fig. 8(d) shows nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves of pure TiO2 and 2Cu-TiO2. Though testing samples, the specific surface areas of pure TiO2 and 2Cu-TiO2 were 61.81 m2/g and 63.91 m2/g, respectively. The specific surface area of 2Cu-TiO2 increases, but the increase is small and does not have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the increase in the photocatalytic activity is mainly due to the increase in the photocarrier separation efficiency. From the experimental results and analysis, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed in Fig. 9 . Firstly, the electrons in the valence band of TiO2 are excited by photons to the conduction band to form electron-hole pairs. According to literature [44], the conduction band potential of Cu(OH)2/Cu (Cu(OH)2 + 2e− = Cu + 2OH−, Eθ = −0.224 V) is slightly lower than that of TiO2 (−0.26 V). While it is higher than reduction potential of H+, permitting it to reduce H+ to H2 (2H+ + 2e− = H2, Eθ = −0.000 V). The transfer of electrons from the CB of TiO2 to Cu(OH)2 will result in the partial reduction of Cu2+ to Cu0 atoms, which promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and will restore of H+ to H2 molecules. This photocatalytic mechanism reaction step is as shown in equations (1) and (2). (1) Cu(OH)2 + 2e− = Cu + 2OH− (2) Cu + 2e− + 2H+ = Cu + H2 When a heterojunction structure forms between TiO2 and Cu(OH)2, a trapezoidal structure can also be formed between the VB and the CB, which facilitates the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of TiO2 to Cu(OH)2. The photo-generated charge can form a current loop from Cu(OH)2 to TiO2, which is beneficial to the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby enhancing photocatalytic H2 production activity [53]."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, we have successfully prepared a photocatalyst of Cu(OH)2 modified TiO2 for photocatalytic H2 production. Cu(OH)2 clusters are effective co-catalysts to enhance the photocatalytic H2-production activity of TiO2, and its content exhibits a significant influence on the activity. The optimum Cu(OH)2 loading was determined to be 2%, and the corresponding hydrogen generation rate was 1994 μmol/h/g, which was more than 8.3 times that of pure TiO2. The potential of Cu(OH)2/Cu is considered to be lower than the conduction band of TiO2, and is more negative than the potential of H+/H2, which facilitates the transfer of electrons from CB of TiO2 to Cu(OH)2 and reduction of H+, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic H2-production activity. The successful preparation of the catalyst was confirmed by XRD, SEM and TEM. The resulting composite catalyst has excellent photocatalytic H2-production activity and photoelectric properties."
