0,Introduction,"The transportation sector is heavily dependent on hydrocarbon-based fuels, facing challenges due to increasing concern about environmental pollution and rapidly depleting conventional fuel sources. The global research community is motivated to improve technology to meet environmental demands and search for alternatives to replace conventional fuels. The IC engines are the automotive industry's prime movers and a vast economic investment that can only sustain a minute change. Therefore, finding an alternative fuel for existing technology with minor modifications would be the priority. Many such proposed fuels are getting investigated, such as methanol, ethanol, and biofuels. However, being a hydrocarbon-based structure, these have equal pollution probability. Hydrogen, without any carbon content, is theoretically a clean source of energy for IC engines. Hydrogen storage is probably a ditch in considering the success of a hydrogen-fueled engine; that can be eliminated by using onboard hydrogen production [1]. It can utilize the unused energy of the engine to improve the overall efficiency [2]. Hydrogen as a fuel is suitable for IC engines without costly makeovers [3,4] for both CI and SI engines. However, properties such as high auto-ignition temperature and low ignition energy of hydrogen are more suitable for SI engines than CI engines. Hydrogen has widely experimented as a supplementary fuel to conventional and non-conventional fuel to SI engines like methane, natural gas, LPG, and alcohols. Hydrogen requires very low ignition energy, which helps it to burn faster. Hydrogen enrichment of high latent heat fuels like methanol [5,6] and butanol [7] boosts combustion resulting in relatively high BPand thermal efficiencies. It also reduces the cold start problems associated with liquid fuels and reduces the warmup time [8]. Even in a gaseous fuel such as methane and LPG, the flame velocity is not higher, and at low temperature faces warmup delays, which gets compensated by hydrogen enrichment [9]. However, electronically controlled hydrogen injection to the inlet port reduces the chances of backfires, most probable in the enrichment process. The high diffusivity helps form a homogenous mixture rapidly, reducing the chances of hydrogen accumulation at the intake manifold [10]. The high laminar flame velocity also helps to reduce the COV of IMEP [11–13]. In addition to this, the parallel port fuelling of hydrogen with other primary fuels forms a homogeneous mixture, which increases the quantity of fuel burnt at TDC, reducing the combustion duration [14,15]. The flame development period and flame propagation period get decreased proportionally to the hydrogen quantity [16]. Thus, the BP gets increased as well as BTE gets increased. However, there is a limitation of performance enhancement with parallel port fueled hydrogen too. The expansion of hydrogen in the intake manifold limits the quantity of air supplied and reduces volumetric efficiency. Therefore, the power produced could be lower than expected [17]. In such a case, slight retardation in the spark advance angle at a high hydrogen fraction helps achieve better efficiency [18]. Hydrogen has a high calorific value but relatively low volumetric energy density. However, its combustion properties compensate for the low energy density to some extent. The calculative hydrogen addition parallel to primary fuel increases the BP slightly in low heat content fuels like methanol and ethanol [19]. Hydrogen demands a high air-fuel ratio and has wide flammability, supporting stable combustion in both lean and rich conditions. However, increasing the excess air ratio λ, the laminar flame velocity decreases rapidly, leading to uneven combustion, which increases the COV of IMEP [20,21]. As a result, the combustion duration increases, Pmax and HRR reduce, leading to a relatively low BTE [22,23]. In a mixture with excess air ratio λ over 2, the net heat added to the engine reduces, the laminar burning velocity drops to half, and the adiabatic flame temperature plunges to two third [24]. Thus, the brake power, BTE, and cylinder pressure reduce, the COV of IMEP increases. Reducing λ further, near to 1, reduces the dependence of it on ηvol, for λ ranging from 1.3 to 1.2, a slight reduction in it, leads to an insignificant reduction in the ηvol; however, the BSFC and BTE remain unchanged [25]. The effect of increasing flame speed diminishes with reducing λ due to increased heat loss by engine cooling and exhaust gas in a range of 1.2 to 1 [26]. Hence, BTE reduces, and power output drops slightly too, despite an insignificant reduction in ηvol. Further reducing excess air ratio below 1, the hydrogen concentration is relatively high, leaving a large amount of fuel to remain unburnt inside the cylinder, which increases the probability of knock with the extent of reduction in λ. A slight delay in the spark angle helps reduce the knock probability completely, even at lower λ [27]. The cold start performance and emissions also benefit from hydrogen with delayed spark angle at a low excess air ratio [28]. The excess air ratio affects the combustion process too, as, with an increase in λ, the flame development (CA10), as well as flame propagation (CA10-90), increase, leading to a longer combustion duration [29]. However, combustion stability with significant modification in the spark angle can be achieved. Hydrogen has no carbon component, hence reduces carbon-based emissions under the use of supplement fuel or combustion booster [6,30,31]. It has a high adiabatic flame temperature, high flame speed, and low quenching distance, helping in fast and complete burning, leading to high cylinder temperature, which increases the NOx emission and EGT [32]. At excess air ratio near 1, the NOx emission and EGT are increased rapidly with hydrogen fraction [26]. However, increasing λ along with retarded spark timing reduces the peak temperature rise, reduces the NOx emission [25,33]. The performance, combustion, and emission of SI engine mainly depend upon the CR, BTE, ηvol, and BP can be increased, and pumping losses can be reduced by increasing the CR [34]. However, the auto-ignition temperature of a fuel decides the CR limits. In gaseous fuel like hydrogen, the volumetric losses can be compensated by increasing the CR to a specific limit. The high self-ignition temperature of hydrogen allows higher CR combustion and improves the lean misfire limit. The port fueling of hydrogen replaces available air and reducing the ηvol. Increasing CR allows a larger mass of air to get in and has better action of exhaust pumping out, resulting in increased ηvol [35], which allows a larger amount of hydrogen to be supplied, increasing the total energy supplied. It increases the hydrogen concentration, leading to better combustion and high BP. At increased CR, the fame development period (CA10) decreases as well as the flame propagation period (CA10-90) also decreases, leading to reduce the total combustion duration [36]. Thus, leading to reduce the COV of IMEP, with an increase in CR, which helps maintain stable combustion and increases the ITE and EER [37]. With increased combustion speed and stability, the Pmax and the HRR are also getting advanced with increased CR, promoting BTE and MGT [38]. Apart from that, the heat loss through cylinder walls also reduce with increasing CR [36] for a hydrogen-fueled engine. However, after a certain CR, the MGT achieves too high values, quickly achieving the autoignition condition, which promotes knock [39]. Here, a significant change in spark advance could avoid knock. However, increasing CR to 15 or above makes it difficult to avoid frequent knocks at λ near 1. The other face of increasing the CR faces a high emission level, specifically NOx. Stable combustion leading to higher MGT and Tmax favors the NOx formation. An increase in CR increases Tmax proportionally, which increases the NOx emission. Further with the increase in hydrogen fraction surges Tmax and leading to even higher NOx [40]. Theoretically nil, the carbon-related emissions are insignificant, which correlates with the high MGT, which leads to evaporating and burning an infinitesimal amount of lubricating oil [41,42]. Idle characteristics also improve at high CR and reduced λ, like BP, BTE, and COV. However, the NOx emission faces a critical increase, at even low λ at 1.1 and below [43]. Among the available literature under the authors' knowledge, a limited amount of work is found for SI engines fueled with hydrogen only for high CR and low excess air ratio. Mostly, the use of hydrogen in SI engines is as secondary fuel or performance and combustion booster. A detailed experimental investigation of a completely hydrogen-fueled SI engine is found necessary for studying the sustainability of hydrogen as a fuel for the SI engine. Therefore, a detailed experimental investigation has been performed for a wide range of CRs, excess air ratios for different speeds in the present study."
1,Experimental setup and procedures,
2,Test Setup,"2.1 Test Setup The experiments are carried out on a 667 cc single-cylinder variable compression ratio four-stroke SI engine, modified from CI engine [34]. The fuel injection system is replaced with the CDI system; the intake line is replaced with a modified intake pipe, fitted with gas injectors (Stag, IG 01, single hole, 0.5–2.5 bar), basically used for CNG injection, and a manually controlled throttle body. The cylinder block is modified to vary CR manually through elevating the cylinder head, with the help of the extension of stud and bolt arrangement, pushing the cylinder head upward. The specifications of the modified test engine are mentioned in Table 1 . A hole is drilled in the cylinder head to install a pressure transducer (PCB Piezotronics, Model SM111A22) to measure the in-cylinder pressure. Similarly, in the exhaust manifold, a K-type thermocouple is installed for measuring the exhaust gas temperature at the exhaust manifold. A 16-bit DAQ (NI-USB-6210) interfaces the signals received from the sensors to a LabView-based program, which analyses the performance and combustion parameters graphically. The crankshaft is coupled with an eddy current dynamometer (Make-Technomech, Model- TMEC10). A 360° angle precision marker disk attached crank encoder (Make Kubler, Model 8. KIS40.1361.0360, Resolution 1 Deg, Speed 5500 RPM with TDC pulse) with trigger mark is installed on the crankshaft. It measures the crank angle with the help of a photoelectric cell, sending the data to the engine management system. Fig. 1 depicts the schematic of the experimental setup. The hydrogen supply unit consists of a hydrogen cylinder, filled at 220 bar, installed with a pressure gauge and delivery valve. A wet-type flame arrester is connected with the cylinder by a gas hose and a direct-read acrylic hydrogen gas rotameter (Make- Tansa Equipment, HS-90261090, 0–200 LPM, least count 0.1 LPM) for measuring flow rate. A dry-type flame arrester is installed, followed by an electronic sequential pressure reducer (Make- Auto Fuels, 1.2 bar–3 bar output). The electronically controlled hydrogen nozzle is connected to the supply line with the help of a non-return valve, is installed in the intake manifold. A fully programmable ECU is installed for controlling the ignition timing, and fuel injection characteristics, as well as, a gas ECU is installed to monitor the flow of hydrogen. A trigger switch connects both ECUs, allowing the open ECU commands to bypass the gasoline management system and run the hydrogen gas management system. 1. Engine, 2. Flywheel,3. Dynamometer, 4.

The panel box (shown on the left side of Fig. 2 ) houses the manual throttle control knob, DAQ, ECU, and Display system for temperature, load, and speed. Along with the ignition switch, the panel box also houses a manual load control unit and a U-tube manometer to measure airflow rate manually. Two rotameters are installed to measure the water flow rate to the engine and calorimeter. For liquid fuel measurement, a burette is installed, and a fuel tank, fuel pump, and fuel filter unit. A rectangular airbox with an air filter and airflow sensor is also installed in the panel box. A shell and tube type calorimeter is coupled with the exhaust line fitted with four K-type thermocouples to measure inlet and outlet fluid temperatures. The specifications of the measuring devices are listed in Table 2 ."
3,Experiment procedure,"2.2 Experiment procedure The tests are performed using 99.95% pure hydrogen supplied to the injectors at 1.2 bar under wide-open throttle. The ignition timing is set at 20° BTDC, retarded slightly from 24° BTDC of gasoline, based on the research reviews and primary trials with hydrogen at φ equals 0.6. The base readings for the comparison purpose are taken from our previous paper [34]. Tests were carried out at the same ambient temperature at 27 °C, and the cooling water flow rates were fixed at 250LPM for the engine and 200LPM for the calorimeter. The data were collected based on an average of 100 cycles, and the manual collection has been done by allowing settling time, which relates to a minimal of ±5% variation in engine speed and load. Exhaust emissions were recorded with the help of AVL di-gas 444, 5-gas exhaust gas analyzer; specifications are listed in Table 3 . The essential steps are taken, keeping safety in considerations, like leakage test of hydrogen line, leak test of the analyzer, filter cleaning, and zero adjustments before starting experiments and relieving the pressure of the hydrogen line after each experiment. The emission data are then converted from a volumetric basis to specific units on a dry basis using equation (1) [44]. equation 1 S E i = V E i { M i M e x × m ˙ e x B P } m ˙ e x = Mass flow rate of exhaust. = m ˙ f + m ˙ a i r M ex = Molecular weight of exhaust, calculated on stoichiometric combustion, 28.72 (gasoline) & 28.04 (dual fuel). S E i = Specific emission of any entity. V E i = Emission data recorded by the analyzer of the entity. M i = Molecular weight of entity. Tests were carried out based on speed varying from 1400RPM to 1800RPM at an interval of 100RPM, for each set of speed, the CR is varied from 10:1 to 15:1, and for each CR, the equivalence ratio φ is changed from 0.4 to 1.0 under wide-open throttle (WOT) conditions. The uncertainty analysis is performed from the readings found by measuring the independent variables such as speed, pressure, hydrogen flow rate and by calculating the dependent variables such as BP, BTE, ηvol from the readings for ten sets of experiments under the same working conditions. The mean, standard deviation, and uncertainty for uncertainty measurement are calculated by the equations mentioned in Ref. [45]. The net deviation in independent variables is found to be ±1.2%, while dependent variables a maximum of ±2.1% deviation found. However, for NOx measurement, a net deviation of 1.92% is observed."
4,Result analysis,
5,Brake power,"3.1 Brake power The BP of an engine primarily depends upon the volumetric energy density; hydrogen having low volumetric energy density, respective to gasoline, seems challenging to raise similar power. However, the fast-burning and retarded ignition angle solves the limitation great [46,47]. Fig. 3 represents the BP variations for different speeds. The BP is increasing with increasing speed, as well as increasing φ and CR. Compared to gasoline, the BP of hydrogen at lean conditions is much lower at low speed and picks up early at the same φ at increasing CR. Besides, the increasing speed helps in overcoming the gasoline BP limit at the same lean φ. However, increased CR observes a negative effect on BP at high CRs; as, at CR14 and CR15, BP drops a little after φ crosses 0.9 at speed up to 1500, which further intensifies for speed above 1600. The probable cause may be the reduction in the ηvol due to high hydrogen concentration, leading to a reduced amount of available air [48,49]. The average increase in BP is 2.8 times for CR10 moving from φ 0.4 to 1.0. However, the increment in BP at higher CR, 14 and 15, are nearly 2.1 and 0.98 times, respectively. The increase in CR from 10 to 14 increases BP by an average of 77% at φ 0.4 and 9.87% at φ 1.0. On the other hand, at CR15, BP increases by 9.8% from CR14 at low values of φ and drops by 1.23% at φ 1.0. A high CR increases the ηvol, cylinder temperature, and reduces the pumping losses, increasing engine intake capacity for gaseous fuel and increasing the power output [50]."
6,Brake thermal efficiency and Brake Specific Energy Consumption,"3.2 Brake thermal efficiency and Brake Specific Energy Consumption The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) varies a lot with varying the values of φ, as shown in Fig. 4 , and so as the BSEC as shown in Fig. 5 . A common trend for all the speeds at low CR is a rapid increase in BTE and a fall in BSEC from φ 0.4 to 0.5. However, increasing the φ values further does not have the exact extent of change. At 1400RPM, the average BTE change at all the CR's for φ 0.4 to 0.5 is nearly 13.4%, which falls gradually to 7.21% at 1800RPM. Similarly, the fall in BSEC is measured to be 11.59%–6.29%. However, the increasing CR decreases the rate of increase in BTE and the rate of decrease in BSEC for the exact change in φ. The increment in BTE at 1400 RPM for φ 0.4 to 0.5 at CR 10 is 23.07%, reducing to 12.15% at CR15. On the other hand, it is also noticed to increase BTE and decrease BSEC with CR change. There is an average 10% increment in BTE and an 8.85% drop in BSEC for φ 0.4 at 1400RPM. Which drops to a 1.78% increment for BTE and 1.69% drop in BSEC for φ 1.0 at 1400RPM. At a higher speed, the rate of change is even low. At 1800RPM average increment in BTE varies from 7.38% to 0.833% for φ, changing from 0.4 to 1.0 while the average drop in BSFC varies from 6.66% to 0.79%. The low flame speed of hydrogen at extreme lean conditions find it difficult to rapidly burn the fuel, leading to a low BP and BTE. However, increasing the CR increases the cylinder pressure and temperature, a favorable condition for efficient burning [51]. Similar results can be observed at a higher CR; the effect of changing φ is insignificant for BTE. This even gets persisting at increased speed, where, at 1600RPM, the effect of increasing φ is within the range of 1.25% from 0.5 to 0.9. However, there is a sink in BTE noticed at CR15 after 1600RPM, even at φ values after 0.8. BTE drops in the same fashion at CR of 14 for speed above 1600RPM and CR13 for speed 1800RPM. A probable cause might be the large volume of hydrogen at intake for higher CR, leading to the displacement of a large amount of air [50]. The black straight lines in all the diagrams represent the gasoline, which signifies that the performance of a hydrogen PFI engine is better than gasoline for a high CR and a wide range of φ [52]. The lean limit is extended to φ 0.5 for better performance under low speed, while even φ 0.4 has better performance at high speed."
7,Volumetric efficiency,"3.3 Volumetric efficiency The ηvol, at particular φ, is almost static irrespective of speed; hence, Fig. 6 represents an average of it over the entire range of speed. The ηvol increases with increasing CR; however, with increasing φ, a parallel drop in ηvol can be traced. This clearly shows the extent of air replaced by the increased hydrogen quantity, which leads to a slight drop in BP and a significant drop in BTE at higher values of φ. Increasing φ observes almost 18% drop averaged over all the CRs while increasing CR from 10 to 15 results in 8.67% boost averaged over all the φ."
8,Cylinder pressure,"3.4 Cylinder pressure The cylinder pressure is measured through the piezo sensor installed inside the combustion chamber; it gives a continuous reading of 720°; however, it needs the variations near TDC to analyze the combustion and performance standards. Thus, Fig. 7 a–e represents cylinder pressure variation from 310° to 410°. Fig. 7f represents the variations in maximum cylinder pressure with CR and φ. From observations, increasing CR increases the Pmax, and increasing φ increases the Pmax [53]. However, the rate of pressure rise for low speeds is more than that of high speeds, and Pmax drops slightly for φ above 0.8 at higher values of CR. The amount of hydrogen supplied is relatively high in such conditions, reducing the ηvol, reduces the Pmax. The increasing CR advances the position of Pmax towards TDC, as well as increasing φ too helps in an advanced Pmax position. At high speed and higher values of φ for CR above 13, BTE falls slightly, which can be related to the Pmax position. As the Pmax is much closer to the TDC, there is a possibility of useful work-loss in overcoming the compression negative work. At a particular speed and CR, the increasing φ is responsible for the rapid boosting of the pressure near TDC; that is, the pressure rise rate increases with φ in the late compression stroke. Since the amount of fuel supplied increases with increasing φ, the total energy-added also increase [54]. The same trend follows for increasing CR too for a particular φ. At 1400 RPM, an average 6% increment at φ 0.4 reduces to 2.14% at φ 1. Similarly, at CR10, an average increase of 5.62% at φ 0.4 reduces to 0.79% φ 1. This rate of rise reduces to an average of 2.78% at 1800RPM and φ 0.4, to 1.56% at 1800RPM and φ 1.0. Similarly, at CR 10, it reduces to 3.3%, and at CR15, to −0.56%. Comparing with CR10 and φ 0.4, the Pmax is almost double for φ 1.0 at 1400RPM, which reduces to merely 26.33% at 1800RPM. However, there is a 19.15% average increase from CR10, φ 0.4 to CR15, φ 1.0 at 1400RPM, which reduces to 13.3% only at 1800RPM. The smoothness of the curve gets enhanced with increasing the φ at low speeds; however, increasing CR narrows the curve near TDC after ignition, which represents better combustion. At high speed, increasing φ first narrows the curve and then flattens it, getting a broader curve at high values of φ. Similarly, increasing CR gets a narrow curve for low values of φ but a flat curve at high values of φ; this represents the rate of pressure rise, which shows the quality of combustion."
9,Combustion duration,"3.5 Combustion duration Hydrogen has high laminar flame velocity, high diffusivity, and low quenching distance, responsible for rapid combustion. Besides, it has a wide flammability range, hence under extreme lean to extreme rich conditions has a high probability of burning. However, the flame speed decreases under lean and highly rich conditions [8,12]. The flame development duration CA10 reduces continuously with increasing φ and CR (from Fig. 8 ). The CA10 reduces by 13.22% from CR10 to CR15 at 1400RPM for φ 0.4. Increasing φ from 0.4 to 1.0 at 1400RPM, It drops by 38.95% at CR10 and 31.2% at CR15. However, with increasing speed, the extent of reduction in CA10 reduces parallelly. Similarly, increasing φ at 1800RPM reduces CA10 by 19.42% from φ 0.4 to φ 1.0 at CR10, further reducing to 11.35% at CR15. Compared to gasoline, CA10 of hydrogen is always less despite low flame velocity at lower φ due to delayed ignition. However, CA10-90 is more for lean hydrogen at low CRs, probably due to the low flame speed and early reach into the expansion stroke. CA10-90 shows similar characteristics as CA10, the flame propagation duration. It is reduced continuously with increasing φ, CR, and speed. The reduction rate of CA10-90 decreases with speed increasing, as, at 1400RPM, the average reduction of 15.75% drops to 7.3% at 1800RPM. Increasing CR further decreases the reduction rate, from 7.3% of CR10 to 4.16% of CR15. Also, CA10-90 increases slightly at 1800RPM and CR above 12 while moving from φ 0.9 to φ 1.0. However, at CR14 and 15, moving from φ 0.8 to 1.0, CA10-90 increases gradually. The probable cause may be the decreasing availability of air due to low ηvol [55]. However, the late burning period decreases continuously with increasing speed and increasing CR for particular φ. There is a continuous reduction in late burning at low speed, with increasing CR and φ too. However, unlike low speed, high speed has slightly different results; increasing CR reduces the duration, but at high CR, the late burning time is almost constant after φ 0.6. The overall combustion duration decreases with increasing CR for all speeds. On the other hand, the total combustion duration increases slightly for rich mixtures at high CR and high speed. However, other than extremely low φ at low CRs, it is always lesser than gasoline. In the same fashion, the CA50 behaves, which decreases with φ and increases CR at low speed. At high speeds of 1700RPM and 1800RPM, the CA50 decreases with CR continuously, but at high CR, this increases insignificantly with increasing φ. The results of combustion duration indicate combustion favoring characteristics of increasing CR and drawbacks of high equivalence ratio."
10,Peak Heat Release Rate,"3.6 Peak Heat Release Rate The laminar flame speed of hydrogen varies significantly with its strength in the mixture, hence the combustion duration as mentioned in section 3.5. Besides, the drop in laminar flame speed is insignificant at a slight lean condition but very high at extremely lean conditions [56]. As a result, the heat release rate (HRR) gets affected, as shown in Fig. 9 a, where the peak HRR is plotted. At almost all the speeds, the variation in peak HRR (HRRmax) with increasing φ is similar. Along with increasing flame speed with φ, the amount of hydrogen also increases, adding excessive energy to the system at any fixed speed. Hence, the amount of energy liberated increases, leading to an increased HRRmax. Along with increasing HRRmax, the position of HRRmax (θ/HRRmax) advances (shown in Fig. 9b). At the initial increments in φ, there is a slight increase in HRRmax, which increases with the increment rate of φ. However, after φ reaches 0.8, the increment rate of HRRmax drops, and some decrements are observed at φ 1.0. It may get explained as the deficiency of oxygen, and improper mixing would lead to combustion imitations. The probability of loss occurrence also advances in terms of φ with increasing speed. At low speed, it is almost negligible at low CR; however, with increasing speed, even at low CR, it is very significant even at φ 0.8. In addition, the θ/HRRmax also retards after attaining a minimum angle with increasing φ at high CR. Since increasing CR helps in better combustion by increasing the cylinder temperature at ignition, the amount of fuel mass burnt increases. Hence, the HRRmax gets increased with CR at any φ as well as the peak is advanced. However, increasing CR after a specific limit and mixture strength has a probability of flame compression. The combustion duration gets increased, and HRRmax reduces slightly. At low speed, due to the availability of cooling time, this effect is insignificant, which is very effective at high speeds. Hence, θ/HRRmax retards too."
11,Exhaust gas temperature (EGT),"3.7 Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is proportional to the amount of fuel burnt; it increases with φ as well as speed. EGT also increases with CR; however, the increment rate is variable with no definite relation. At 1400RPM, EGT increases by 10% at CR10 moving from φ 0.4 to 0.5, which reduces to 3.89% from 0.9 to 1.0. However, at 1800RPM, at the same CR10, EGT increases by 25.27%, moving from φ 0.4 to 0.5, which reduces to 2% moving from 0.9 to 1.0. The increasing EGT follows a pattern, as the increment rate of EGT increases with an increase in speed for φ increased from 0.4 to 0.5. It drastically reduces for increasing the φ further from 0.5 onwards. There is an average increase of 5.67% in EGT at CR10 and 1400RPM, which increases to 8.49% at 1800RPM. The increasing CR has similar observations too, as at 1400RPM and φ 0.4, EGT increases by an average of 3% per CR, which, unlike φ, increases slightly to 4.83% for φ 1.0. However, increasing the speed deviates the increment rate of EGT insignificantly. At 1800RPM, and φ 0.4, the average increment per CR is 3.28%, slightly reducing to 2.83% at φ 1.0. Fig. 10 represents the EGT variations, where black horizontal lines represent the EGT of gasoline. It draws a comparison between gasoline and hydrogen. At low speed, the high CR with higher φ produces EGT higher than gasoline, while at high speed, at the same high CR's EGT is greater than gasoline even at slightly lean conditions. It refers to the shorter combustion duration of hydrogen, leading to fast combustion and better power delivery, which also helps in cooling the engine faster, responsible for the low rate of increase in EGT at high CR and φ [57]."
12,Exhaust gas emissions,"3.8 Exhaust gas emissions The adiabatic flame temperature of Hydrogen is very high, as well as rapid combustion leads to a very high peak temperature, which is responsible for increasing NOx emissions. Fig. 11 represents specific NOx emissions at different speeds [8]. The increasing CR increases the NOx at any φ while increasing φ too increases the NOx emissions. Similarly, NOx is also increasing with increasing speed. The increment in CR results in increased MGT, which leads to a relatively high peak temperature. Similarly, with increasing φ, the hydrogen concentration increases. Hence, energy supplied increases, so the peak temperature increases too [34,58]. Under very lean conditions at low speed, the emission is insignificant at low CR. However, increasing CR leads to a rapid increase in NOx. At 1400RPM and φ 0.4, it increases by an average of 28.67% per CR moving from CR10 to CR15. The increment rate reduces to 10.59% at 1400RPM and φ 1.0. On the other hand, at CR10 and 1400RPM, NOx increases by 24.53% per 0.1 increments in φ, increasing φ from 0.4 to 1.0. It reduces to 9.77% at CR15 and 1400RPM. The NOx emissions suffer severely by increasing the speed to 1800RPM. With increasing speed, the effect of increasing φ and CR reduces. However, at any CR and φ, NOx emissions are increasing rapidly with increasing speed. Though the percentage increase in emission is low at φ 1.0, it becomes double from 1400RPM to 1800RPM. The CR increased further from 10 to 15 results in a rapid increase in NOx. The maximum NOx emission is recorded for CR15 at φ 1.0 in all the speeds. Compared to gasoline, hydrogen sees a rapid NOx emission after φ increased from 0.6. With an increase in CR, the NOx emission overcomes gasoline even at lower φ. This is all due to hydrogen's high adiabatic flame temperature and increasing laminar flame velocity with increasing φ [59]. The carbon-based emissions are negligible, as the CO2 emissions are in the range of 0.03–0.04%. The gas analyzer does not observe the CO emissions as the least-count is 0.01%, and the HC emissions have recorded a maximum of 13 ppm only at CR15, φ 0.9 at 1800RPM. Another significant emission recorded is O2 emissions, as shown in Fig. 12 . It decreases with increasing φ, as well as increasing the engine speed. Increasing the CR increases the O2 emission slightly at lean conditions; however, increasing CR decreases emissions at higher CR and rich conditions. A probable cause of O2 emission reduction with increasing φ may be the reduction in ηvol. However, increasing CR though increases the ηvol, the hydrogen flow rate also increases, leading to an increase in the consumption of O2. The trend is similar for all the speeds with insignificant differences."
13,Conclusions,"The experimental study of hydrogen port fueled SI engine is performed for varying compression ratios (CR10 to CR15) and equivalence ratios (0.4–1.0) under wide throttle conditions for speed varying from 1400RPM to 1800RPM. From the performance, combustion, and emission analysis, the following conclusions are derived; • Hydrogen under a high compression ratio (CR15) and a moderate equivalence ratio near 0.7 has improved performance, increasing the BP and BTE above gasoline. • Under a high CR (CR15) and equivalence ratio of 0.9, the CA10 and CA10-90 exhibit minimum values leading to fast combustion and high peak pressure. • The fast-burning quality reduces cooling losses and provides better energy conversion. • Hydrogen is also found responsible for drastically reducing the volumetric efficiency, which gets overcome by a significant margin by increasing CR. • The NOx emission increases rapidly with decreasing the lean limit and increasing CR. At CR15 and φ 1.0, very high NOx is recorded, far above gasoline. However, being carbon-free, hydrogen has negligible CO, CO2, and HC emissions. • The fuel properties of hydrogen are favorable to get mixed well and uniform achieving rapid combustion. At high CR, there is an additional allowance to use more fuel to overcome the limited energy density of hydrogen, leading to the high-power output at enhanced BTE up to a certain extent. There are some future scopes to further test hydrogen in the SI engine, with changing the ignition timing, to find out the optimized condition to be used as a primary fuel in the SI engine. Further, the NOx emission control can also be studied. With an onboard hydrogen generator, it would be more significant to operate a hydrogen-fueled vehicle."
