0,Introduction,"Biodiesel is a renewable fuel resource that can be used in its pure form or mixed with diesel oil ‘as is’ because they are miscible and have similar physicochemical properties [1]. Brazil, along with Germany and the United States, is one of the world's largest biodiesel markets, both with regard to production and consumption. Other important markets are France, Spain, Italy and Argentina. In addition to the various environmental advantages presented by biodiesel, it can also be produced from a wide variety of oleaginous substances and various short chain alkyl alcohols. As a result of these numerous combinations of esters and alcohols, the resulting biodiesel might exhibit varying physicochemical and combustion properties. To standardize these properties, authorization to use this fuel must meet stringent quality specifications to ensure trouble-free performance. These specifications include the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751 in the USA, EN 14214 in Europe, and CNS 15072 in Taiwan. In Brazil, biodiesel specifications must comply with ANP Resolution N° 30, defined by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP). One of the major technical obstacles for the use of biodiesel fuel is its cold flow properties, which can be critical, depending on the climate and seasonal conditions of the region in which the fuel will be used. Several methods have been developed to measure low-temperature properties of diesel fuels and to estimate their effects on low temperature operability of vehicles. Common tests include the Cloud Point and the Pour Point methods. A number of filterability methods are also used, including cold filter plugging point (CFPP), low-temperature flow test (LTFT) and Simulated Filter Plugging Point (SFPP). Among these parameters, the CFPP (applied in countries outside North America) is a direct and reliable indicator for low-temperature engine operability. The maximum limit set by the European standard EN 14214-12 is 0 °C whereas the American standard ASTM D6751 does not stipulate limits. In Brazil, the ANP tolerates limits ranging from 0 to +12 °C, depending on the time of year and the region of the country. Despite the fact that the predominant weather in Brazil is moderate, the use of this biofuel is compromised during the winter in some regions in the south of the country because it has a high freezing point. The same thing happens in several other countries that consume biodiesel. To meet the most stringent specifications, we believe that when the value of CFPP is lower, the biodiesel will be better. Ideally, it should not exceed 0 °C. The literature proposes different production or processing conditions for the final product to improve the cold properties of the biodiesel generally obtained with methanol. Among them, we can highlight the addition of additives based on aromatic compounds [2], the use of short chain oleaginous substances [3], winterization processes [4,5] and the use of branched-chain alcohols [6]. Regardless of these restrictions, several studies have been conducted in which the alcohol employed in the synthesis of biofuels is changed. The effects on cold properties and the manner in which this change affects the other physicochemical properties so as to meet other international standards have been studied. Considering the alternative of choosing new alcohols as reagents in the transesterification reaction, one of the limiting factors is the European standard for biodiesel specifications, EN 14214, which determines that biodiesel should be composed of methyl esters of fatty acids (FAME), that is, only methanol is allowed in the reactions. The American standards, ASTM D6751, are less stringent and allow other alkyl alcohols to be used. In addition to meeting both international standards, methanol is widely used in biodiesel production despite its toxicity because of its superior reactivity, low cost, and availability [7]. Much is said about the use of different alkyl alcohols for the production of biodiesel, but nothing is discussed in the literature regarding the use of alcohols with aromatic chains, except in the work performed by our group [3,4]. The proposal for studying the biodiesel produced with benzyl alcohol was based on the use of aromatic additives in biodiesel as a pour point depressant and thermal stabilizer [2]. Ethanol has been widely studied, especially in Brazil and Spain [8], perhaps due to its value as a renewable commodity, with low toxicity and environmental impact [9]. Knothe et al. studied the biodiesel obtained from methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and 2-ethylhexyl alcohols, evaluating, among other properties, the cetane number of the esters produced [10]. Sanli and Canakci, in addition to studying different oils, produced biodiesel from various alcohols such methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and n-butyl alcohols [7]. Foglia et al. published a study of the cold properties of methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl and sec-butyl esters, as well as their respective blends with diesel [11]. In another study, Foglia, together with Wu et al., studied the effects of methyl, ethyl and isopropyl alcohols on the performance of their respective esters in engines [12]. Furthermore, Lee et al. evaluated the decrease in the crystallization temperature of methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, sec-butyl, terc-butyl and neopentyl esters obtained from soybean oil and canola oil, among others [6]. Other than the work already performed by our group involving benzyl esters from palm oil, there are no other reports in the literature regarding transesterification reactions using this alcohol, despite its low cost [3,4]. Up to the present moment, there is also no knowledge of research using isoamyl alcohol to produce biodiesel, which, therefore, makes the present study innovative. It is worth mentioning that isoamyl alcohol is a residue from the fermentation process in the production of ethanol [13] and can be used to produce a fully renewable biodiesel. Previous studies have shown that the fatty acid profile of the feedstock influences the CFPP of biodiesel samples because of the different melting points of individual FAMEs [14]. Unsaturated FAMEs have melting points lower than those of saturated FAMEs. Consequently, biodiesels with a higher concentration of unsaturated FAMEs such as that produced from the soybean oil tend to have lower CFPP. In spite of the various oilseeds studied in the production of biodiesel, production in Brazil mostly focuses on processing soybean oil with methanol [15,16]. Nevertheless, ethanol has been widely studied, especially in Brazil and Spain [8], perhaps because of its value as a renewable commodity with a low toxicity and environmental impact [9]. The foregoing is a justification for exploring the particularity with regard to the cold properties of the esters obtained from soybean oil transesterified with methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, isoamyl and benzyl alcohols."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Commercial soybean oil (Liza®) was used without further purification. All reagents were of analytical grade: Methanol (99.8%, VETEC®, Brazil), ethanol (99.5%, VETEC®, Brazil), isopropyl alcohol (99.5%, VETEC®, Brazil), isoamyl alcohol (99.36%, NEON®, Brazil), Benzyl alcohol (99.0%, SYNTH®, Brazil), sodium methoxide in 30% methanol (VETEC®, Brazil), potassium biphthalate (99.95-100.05%, VETEC®, Brazil) and CDCl3 containing 1% TMS (D, 99.8%, CIL®, USA). HPLC grade methanol (J.T. Baker®), isopropyl alcohol (J.T. Baker®) and hexane (Mallinckodt®) were used as eluents for HPLC analysis."
3,Biodiesel synthesis,"2.2 Biodiesel synthesis Alkyl and benzyl esters were prepared by transesterification of 100 g of soybean oil with 6:1 alcohol: oil molar ratio of methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, isoamyl or benzyl alcohol and 1% (w/w) sodium methoxide catalyst to oil were used, discounting the acidity of the raw material in each case, as previously described in the literature [17]. The mixture was stirred and heated at 65 °C for methanol preparation and at 85 °C for preparation with other alcohols. After 1 h, The phases that formed as reaction products were separated, and the organic fraction was neutralised with 0.1% HCl(aq), then washed with distilled warm water (40 °C). For the reaction performed with isoamyl and benzyl alcohol, an extra step was added to remove the remaining alcohol after washing the ester layer with water [4]. The resulting organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, and excess alcohol was removed at reduced pressure. Excess isopropyl alcohol was removed at a reduced pressure at 90 °C for more than 1 h, due to its higher boiling point. The biofuel was cooled to 18 °C for 24 h then rapidly subjected to vacuum filtration using a Buchner funnel with a sintered glass plate with 16–40 μm pores in order to remove possible insoluble impurities."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods All the analyses were done in triplicate. The biofuels were characterised based on their density (Anton Paar DMA 4500 automatic density meter, according to ASTM D4052), kinematic viscosity (Precitech Haake rheometer, according to ASTM D445), sodium content (Perkin Elmer Analyst 400, according to ABNT NBR 15553), higher and lower heating values (PARR 1241 adiabatic calorimeter, according to ABNT MB-2850 and ABNT NBR 8628), CFPP (TANAKA equipment with LAUDA RK8 CS – EDITION 2000 bath cooler, according to ASTM D6371), oxidation stability (Metrohm Biodiesel Rancimat instrument, according to EN 14112:2003), acid values (AT500N automatic potentiometric titrator, according to ASTM-D664), lubricity (PCS Instruments High-Frequency Reciprocating Rig and Meiji Techno ML7000 microscope, according to ASTM D6079) and the sulphur content (Antek 9000NS ultraviolet fluorescence analyser, according to ASTM D5453). Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectra (FTIR) were obtained on an ARIS-ZONE ABB Bomem-MS Series spectrometer with 16 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1. Attenuated Total Reflection spectroscopy (ATR) was used with a diamond accessory. FTIR spectra were acquired between 4000 and 1000 cm−1. HPLC was used to detect the presence of fatty acids (FA), monoacylglycerides (MG), diacylglycerides (DG), triacylglycerides (TG), and the alkyl and benzyl esters using a Shimadzu LC-20AT chromatography system [SIL-20A HT automatic sampler, DGU-20A5 degasser, CTO-20A column oven, SPD-M20A UV−vis detector, SIL- 20HT pump, and Shimadzu CLCODS C18 column (M) (25 × 4.6 mm)] at 40 °C, with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a detector with the wavelength set to 205 nm. The samples were analysed as previously described in the literature [3]. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to determine the yield of the TG conversion for esters using a 200 MHz Bruker Avance DPX 200 spectrometer. The samples were dissolved in CDCl3, and TMS was used as the reference."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Biodiesel synthesis,"3.1 Biodiesel synthesis The biofuel was codified according to the correspondent alcohol used during the transesterification reaction as follows: SME (soybean methyl ester), SEE (soybean ethyl ester), SPE (soybean isopropyl ester), SAE (soybean isoamyl ester), and SBE (soybean benzyl ester). All the respective biodiesels were yellowish liquids at room temperature regardless of the alcohol used during the transesterification process. The transesterification conditions of the reactions were the same, regardless of the alcohol used, except for the reflux temperature methyl alcohol was used because of the lower boiling point of its mixture. When using methanol was used, the mixture was refluxed at 65 °C, whereas the temperature of 85 °C was used for all the other alcohols as an ideal condition already described in previous works [3,4]. At the end of the reactions, the excess of the respective alcohols (isopropyl, isoamyl and benzyl alcohols) was removed using special conditions because of their higher boiling points. This special treatment required for the purification of the respective ester can considered to be a disadvantage because of the time and energy requirements."
7,Biofuels composition,"3.2 Biofuels composition On an industrial scale, both in Brazil and in several other countries, the production of biodiesel from soybean oil utilizes homogeneous catalysis with sodium methoxide and methanol as the reagent alcohol [15,16]. The present work proposes to change the reagent alcohol to improve the cold properties of biodiesel without causing major changes in the industrial process as a whole. Therefore, the reactions were carried out by maintaining the use of soybean oil and sodium methoxide and altering only the reagent alcohol. This implies that, when using the different alcohols (ethyl, isopropyl, isoamyl and benzyl), both the methyl ester and the respective alkyl or benzyl esters will exist in the composition of the final biodiesel. This fact can facilitate the characterization of composition of the final product. The international method proposed to determine the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) content of the biodiesel uses the GC-FID technique and is needed to meet the requirements of the standard EN 14214 and CNS 15072, which proposes a minimum content of 96.5%. However, apart from the SME sample, this standard technique shows no viability for esters with higher alcohol content as is the case with those studied here, such as SEE, SPE, SAE and SBE. In order to satisfy these requirements, the literature proposes the 1 H NMR spectroscopy technique as a good method to quantify the ester content with a good relationship with the standard method using GC-FID [4]. For this reason, the 1H NMR analyses of the samples studied here were used to quantify the converted esters from their respective TG, including those of the FAME. The 1H NMR (200 MHz) spectra of soybean oil and its respective SME, SEE, SPE, SAE and SBE esters are presented in Fig. 1 . The percentage of TG converted to esters was obtained directly through integration of the areas (I) of the selected signals of the 1H NMR spectra, depending on which alkyl or benzyl ester, as proposed by equations 1 to 5. The peaks selected in the integration of the spectra (α and a-e) are elucidated in the structures of their respective esters (Fig. 1). The total ester content was determined from the spectra, both for the methyl ester SME and for the higher esters SEE, SPE, SAE or SBE. In the case of the higher esters, the total amount of esters is given by the sum of the peaks characteristic of the SME and the higher esters in the mixture because the transesterification was processed with the sodium methoxide catalyst in a methyl alcohol solution [3]. (1) %CSME = 100(2I a /3IαCH2) (2) %CSEE = 100(I b /I αCH2 + 2Ia/3IαCH2) (3) %CSPE = 100(2I c /I αCH2 + 2Ia/3IαCH2) (4) %CSAE = 100(I d /I αCH2 + 2Ia/3IαCH2) (5) %CSBE = 100(I e /I αCH2 + 2Ia/3IαCH2) where%C is the total ester content of the respective biofuel SME, SEE, SPE, SAE and SBE. I a is the area under the three methoxy hydrogen peaks in the region of 3.6 ppm (singlet); I b is the area under the two α-ethoxy hydrogen peaks in the region of 4.1 ppm (multiplet); I c is the area of the secondary hydrogens of the α-isopropoxy in the region of 5.0 ppm (multiplet); I d is the area under the two CH2-isoamyl hydrogen peaks in the region of 4.1 ppm (triplet); and I e is the area under the two CH2-benzylic hydrogen peaks in the region of 5.1 ppm (singlet). All of those signals are relative to the area under the two α-carbonyl hydrogen peaks (IαCH2) at 2.3 ppm (triplet) present in all of the esters, in the FFA and in the mono-, di- and triglycerides [3]. It is notable that, in Eqs. (1)–(5), the degree of conversion of the oil into esters was considered to be the sum of the ester contents obtained with the corresponding alcohols (integration of the signals b–e) and the methyl ester content (integration of signal a at 3.6 ppm) because these esters were also formed using sodium methoxide as the catalyst [3]. It is important to note in Table 1 that, regardless of the total ester content obtained from higher alcohols, the FAME content in all the samples averaged 16%. We have to emphasise the fact that no signal (or a very small one) corresponding to the presence of mono-, di- and triglycerides (4.35–4.10 ppm) or glycerine (4.64 ppm) was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum for the SME, SEE or SBE samples [18]. The same result was observed for the SPE and SAE samples, which could justify the low total ester content presented in Table 1. Apart from the method used, the minimum ester content proposed by EN 14214 is 96.5%. Excepting for the SME and SEE products, the remaining samples did not meet the standard requirements for biodiesel (Table 1). Also, analysis of the data obtained by 1H NMR spectra revealed a decrease in ester content as the ramification of the alkyl chain becomes closer to the α- hydroxy position of the precursor alcohol. This fact can be explained by the stearic hindrance that this ramification causes during the transesterification reaction [4]. Although the benzyl alcohol presents a high stearic hindrance, its acidity is closer to that of methyl alcohol and higher than those of the ramified isopropyl and isoamyl alcohols. This fact could justify the higher ester content when compared with those obtained from the higher alkyl alcohols (Table 1). Fig. 2 presents the HPLC chromatograms of soybean oil and its respective ester samples with the different alcohols. The HPLC chromatogram of soybean oil shows that the characteristic TG peaks appear at retention times between 19.0 and 24.0 min, the DG peaks from 9.5 to 19.0 min, the MG peaks appear from 3.0 to 5.0 min, the FA from 2.0 to 3.0 min and the FAME arises as three main peaks from 5.0 to 7.5 min (Fig. 2). These peaks were attributed by analogy to the palm esters previously discussed by Bejan et al. [3]. For the SME, three peaks are highlighted in the FAME region and can be attributed to ester of C16:0, C18:1 and C18:2, given that those are the most common FA present in soybean oil [19,20]. The absence of significant signals in the SME chromatograms after 8 min, is evidence that there is neither TG nor DG in this sample (Fig. 2). However, besides the strong presence of FAME in this sample, we also observe the presence of MG and FA due to the peaks from 3.0 to 5.0 min. The higher number of peaks or the presence of bands on the chromatograms of the esters synthesised with ethyl, isopropyl, isoamyl and benzyl alcohols is due to the presence of methyl biodiesel in all of the samples plus their respective alkyl or benzyl esters, as previously shown in the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 1). This result occurred because the commercial catalyst used was prepared in a methanol solution, as previously discussed [3]. For a better presentation of the different retention times of the superior alcohol, a dashed line marked the chromatogram, indicating the time presented for the main fatty acid methyl ester peaks. We notice that the higher the molar mass of the alcohol in the transesterification reactions, the longer the retention time of the respective esters. In the SEE sample, apart from a very small peak present at 3.0 min and the non-significant presence of peaks after 8 min, we can assume that this sample does not present FA, DG or TG. However, the peaks around 4 min show a small presence of DG for the SEE, as for SPE. Different from the other samples, for SPE we observed the presence of some DG with a retention time between 11 and 13 min. For the case of SBE, its MG seems to be present in the band between 6 and 7 min, together with the peak of C16:0 of the methyl ester and its C16:0, C18:1 and C18:2 benzyl esters seem to appear at the retention times of 7.0, 8.5 and 10.0 min. For this SBE sample, we also notice the presence of DG at the peaks from 11 to 13 min. The higher presence of intermediates in the samples SPE, SAE and SBE can explain their low conversion yield (Table 1). Fig. 3 shows the spectrum of biofuel samples SME, SEE, SPE, SAE and SBE produced with soybean oil using different alcohols. Independent of the alcohol used, they all showed peaks at 2925 (Fig. 3a) and 2855 cm−1 (Fig. 3b) which correspond to CH of the alkyl groups. The peaks at 1460 and 720 cm−1 (Fig. 3f) are related to CC and CH of the alkene group, typical of the unsaturated FA of the soybean oil. The peaks at 1750 (Fig. 3c) and 1170 cm−1 (Fig. 3d) correspond to the CO and CO, respectively, from the functional ester group. The absence of the broad band from 3300 to 3400 cm−1 is evidence that there is no significant presence of alcohol intermediates in the samples, as bands in this region are characteristic of the OH stretch [21]. For the specific case of the SPE sample, the peak at 1100 cm−1 (Fig. 3e) is characteristic of the secondary ester due to the isopropyl alcohol. For the benzyl ester SBE, the specific peak at 690 cm−1 (Fig. 3g) corresponds to the CH of the aromatic ring. Table 1 shows the chemical composition of the biofuels synthesised, such as the acid number, sulphur and sodium content, as well as their international standard limitations, besides the ester content already discussed. Considering the European (EN) and the American (ASTM) standards for biodiesel, all the alkyl esters satisfy requirements, except for the ester content of SPE and SAE, as previously discussed. As expected, the sulphur content is lower than the international standard when the feedstock is a refined vegetable oil and no other sulphur source was used during the reaction. The sodium content is also very low, which shows that the washing step was efficient. The acid number shows that all the samples meet international specifications however the higher values for the SEE and SPE samples can be attributed to the presence of a considerable amount of FA, as seen in previous discussions about their HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 2)."
8,Biofuels physicochemical properties,"3.3 Biofuels physicochemical properties The formation of solids at low temperatures represents a limitation on the viability of biodiesel as an alternative fuel, especially in countries with a cold climate. Improvement of its cold properties (cloud point (CP), pour point (PP) and cold-filter plugging point (CFPP)) implies decreasing the initial crystallization temperature of the solidification of the fuel. One alternative to achieve this is by mixing biodiesel with mineral diesel oil or adding crystallization reducing additives [2]. Besides the importance of such a property, there are no requirements, either American or European, that limit the maximum and minimum values for any of those parameters (CP, PP or CFPP). Nevertheless, the use of biodiesel with high values for these properties, especially above 0 °C, is not desirable, justifying research aimed at reducing biodiesel solidification temperatures. Table 1 presents all the esters synthesised with the different alcohols showing negative temperatures for CFPP values. Compared with the literature, it can be seen that the CFPP value of the SME (–5 °C) is lower than the FAME of soybean oil already obtained by Lee et al. [5], Wu et al. [12] and Foglia et al. [11], with +3.7 °C, −3 °C and −3 °C, respectively. This difference may be due to the purification of the biofuel, the winterization step, which eliminates a great quantity of the intermediates and saturated ester chain, not allowing them to negatively interfere in the biodiesel clogging point [4]. Depending on the alcohol used during the transesterification, we notice that the CFPP value decreases the longer the carbon chain becomes. This value also decreases in the presence of branching. This behaviour may be due to the reduced molecular packing ability when solid, in agreement with Bejan et al. [3] and Hammond et al. [6]. In this way, among all the biofuels studied, the isoamyl (−7.7 °C) and the isopropyl ester (−11.3 °C) presented the best results (Table 1). The ethyl ester also presented a better CFPP compared with the methyl one, but not such a significant gain as the branched alcohol. Besides the fact that aromatic additives are used as a pour point depressant and thermal stabilizer of the biodiesel [2], the presence of the benzyl in the structure of the ester did not show any change in its CFPP, compared to the respective methyl ester. The control of kinematic viscosity at 40 °C aims to allow a good atomization of the oil and preserve its lubricating characteristic. Viscosity must be such as to ensure the flow of the product from the tank to the combustion chamber, performing the biodiesel lubrication function for the injection system components, and promote good spraying of the biodiesel injected into the chamber. In order to meet the specifications established by ASTM and EN, the viscosities of the esters produced were measured (Table 1). Comparatively, the viscosity of the soybean oil used in the reactions was measured, resulting in 31.6 mm2s−1, a value with an order of magnitude higher than their respective biofuels. We notice that, among the biofuels, there is an increase of viscosity with increasing alcohol carbon chains, in agreement with Lang et al. [22]. This could be explained by the higher molecular interactions between carbon chains when a superior alcohol is used [4]. The kinematic viscosity for the esters of SME, SEE and SPE meets both the American and European requirements. However, while the high molecular interactions of the isoamyl still satisfy the ASTM limit they exceeded EN specifications. On the other hand, the benzyl ester, SBE, exceeded both specifications. ASTM does not specify density while the EN specifies 15 °C. All the alkyl samples studied met European standards referent to this property and they present as inversely proportional to the number of carbons of the alcohol, independent of the alcohol having a branched chain, agreeing with the results of Canakci and Gerpen [23]. Although benzyl ester has a higher number of carbons, the material showed an increase in biodiesel density compared with the alkyl esters, which is most likely due to the smaller molecular volume occupied by this compound, attributed to stronger intermolecular interactions [4]. The lubricity test is intended to predict the wear and tear that the injection system of a vehicle may suffer due to the lubricating capacity of the fuel used. It refers to the reduction of friction between solid surfaces relative to motion, which is why the high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) is a method for evaluating diesel fuel lubrication. The lubricating efficiency of the fuel was estimated by measuring the average wear scar diameter (WSD) of the spherical specimen generated in the HFRR test using a photomicroscope, which is sensitive to contamination of the fluids. A higher WSD value indicates increased scarring of the component analysed with the fluid, indicating lower lubricity properties of the fuel. The HFRR test specified in ISO 12156-1 meets WSD requirements that do not exceed 460 μm (μm). The U.S. diesel specifications (ASTM D 975-09) include a maximum WSD value of 520 μm (according to ASTM D 6079) [17]. Accordingly, all the samples meet the specifications (Table 1), with SEE having the best performance. However, we observed a nonlinear behaviour for biodiesel lubricity as a function of the number of carbons of the alcohol, or of the alkyl or benzyl nature of the chain. The oxidative stability of biodiesel may be determined by a Rancimat apparatus. Using this technique, European EN 14112 standards stipulate a minimum induction time of 6 h at 110 °C, while the American ASTM D6751:2015 standard requires a minimum time of 3 h at 110 °C [24]. Table 1 shows that the soybean ester obtained with all the alkyl alcohol meets American regulations, however, only the biofuel obtained with isopropyl and isoamyl, meets the more stringent European standards. Meanwhile, the benzyl ester would satisfy neither specification. Heating value is not a specified property for biodiesel, but it is an important determination, since the energy content of fatty esters is a property that indicates the feasibility of using these compounds as fuel [25]. Given that combustion heat is the amount of heat released in the complete combustion of the substance in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to have values high enough so that the fuel can generate an acceptable amount of energy when burned in the engines. The literature shows that heating values are higher for molecules with lower oxygen content, with higher carbon chains and lower amounts of unsaturation [14]. Compared to diesel, vegetable oils have a lower combustion heat, around 39.71 MJ.kg−1. Diesel has a combustion heat of around 45.14 MJ.kg−1. Table 1 shows that the isoamyl ester presented the highest combustion heat, although the values found for the other biofuels differed by approximately 3%, which means that there were no changes in this property with the type of alcohol used, and that those heat values are closer to vegetable oil than to diesel."
9,Conclusions,"This study had the objective of investigating the physicochemical properties of the ester produced by the transesterification of soybean oil with different alcohols, aiming to present a biofuel with a better cold property. To this end, ethyl, isopropyl, isoamyl and benzyl alcohols were used. Methyl ester of soybean was also synthesised as a reference. Ethyl and isoamyl alcohols were chosen as they are produced from a renewable source and no further study was done regarding the use of isoamyl alcohol for biodiesel production. Benzyl alcohol was studied because aromatic additives are used as a pour point depressant and thermal stabilizer for biodiesel, while isopropyl alcohol tends to improve its cold properties. Soybean oil was chosen given that it is the vegetable oil industrially used in Brazil to produce biodiesel. The properties investigated for all the esters synthesised in the present study were CFPP, lubricity, combustion heat, oxidation stability at 110 °C, density and kinematic viscosity at 40 °C. The chemical composition of the ester was determined by the 1H NMR, HPLC, FTIR, acid number and sodium and sulphur content. The 1H NMR studies show that only the methyl and ethyl esters meet the international minimum ester content for biodiesel specifications. Despite this, all the others properties were satisfactory. The best cold properties were observed with isopropyl and isoamyl esters, with CFPP −11.3 and −7.7 °C, respectively, while the standard methyl and benzyl esters of soybean shows −5.0 °C when produced under the same conditions. This study demonstrated the high potential of the superior alcohols isopropyl and isoamyl as a substitute for the conventional methyl alcohol used in the biodiesel market of soybean, concerning its usage in low temperature regions. Special attention should be given to the isoamyl ester given that its precursor alcohol belongs to one of the by-products in the production of ethanol and presents a low cost. The presence of the benzyl in the structure of the ester did not show any change in its CFPP, compared to the respective methyl ester. Moreover, the benzyl ester did not meet international requirements in terms of ester content, kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, density, or oxidation stability at 110 °C."
