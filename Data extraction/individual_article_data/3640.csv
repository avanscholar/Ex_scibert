0,Introduction,"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an essential two-dimensional material with a tunable bandgap from 1.2 eV (bulk) to 1.9 eV (single monolayer), which can be suitably controlled by the number of layers [1,2]. There are different kinds of techniques used to fabricate few-layers MoS2 nanostructures, such as liquid-phase exfoliation [3,4], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [5–7], atomic layer deposition (ALD) [8,9], scotch tape-based micromechanical exfoliation [10], sonochemical exfoliation [11], liquid-phase exfoliation [12], and hydrothermal methods [13–15]. Among them, a facile hydrothermal method has been often used to prepare few-layers MoS2 nanostructures [13,16]. There are some advantages to the hydrothermal approach, such as non-catalysis, non-template, low cost, and minimal equipment requirement [17,18]. Recently, MoS2 has been used for the photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants, ascribed to its high visible light response and laminar structure with a large specific surface area [19–21]. However, MoS2 has exhibited the fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers to limit its photocatalytic efficiency [22]. MoS2 coupled with metal oxide has been used to overcome the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers for improving its photocatalytic activity, such as MoS2/TiO2 [3,23,24], MoS2/ZnO [25,26], MoS2/Fe3O4 [27], MoS2/Bi2O3 [28], and MoS2/Cu2O [29]. Compared to other metal oxide materials, ZnO has a tremendous interest due to its high oxidative potential, high thermal and chemical stability, nontoxicity, high quantum efficiency, low cost, and abundant raw material [30–32]. In recent work, MoS2/ZnO heterostructures can efficiently separate photogenerated charge carriers to improve their photocatalytic decomposition of organic dyes [33]. However, fewer reports about the growth of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures are applied in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [34]. In this study, MoS2 and ZnO were further combined to form a MoS2/ZnO heterostructure, and the relevant properties were analyzed and discussed. It has also been applied to the photocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue solution and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution for in-depth analysis and discussion."

De-ionized water with a resistivity higher than 18.2 MΩ used for all solution preparations."
3,Preparation of MoS2 nanoflakes,"2.2 Preparation of MoS2 nanoflakes MoS2 nanoflakes synthesized by a hydrothermal method. In a typical process, 0.0363 g Na2MoO4·2H2O and 0.0225 g TAA were prepared in the 20 mL aqueous solution and transferred into a Teflon-line autoclave. The autoclave heated at 200 °C for 12 h. The product was washed with de-ionized water and recollected by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 15 min. Finally, the products dried at 70 °C for further use."
4,Preparation of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures,"2.3 Preparation of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures For MoS2 precursor, the as-synthesized MoS2 nanoflakes with the different amounts uniformly distributed in 10 mL ethanol solution by ultrasonic treatment. The MoS2/ZnO heterostructures were synthesized through a simple wet chemistry approach. In a typical procedure, 0.595 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate, 0.28 g hexamethylenetetramine, 0.066 g folic acid, and above MoS2 precursor were co-dispersed in 100 mL de-ionized water. The mixture was heated at 90 °C for 3 h. The product was washed with de-ionized water and recollected by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 15 min. Finally, the products dried at 70 °C for the characterization."
5,Apparatus and measurements,"2.4 Apparatus and measurements Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were taken on a JEOL JSM-6500 F at a voltage of 15 kV. Field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) measurements (such as FETEM, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), selected-area diffraction (SAED) pattern, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images) were taken on a JEOL 2010F at a voltage of 200 kV. The specific surface area measurements were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption-desorption at liquid N2 temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed by a Bruker D2 phaser with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of samples were analyzed on a PL spectrometer (RAMaker, Protrustech, Taiwan) at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. The absorption spectra of samples were measured via a UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS, Hitachi U-2900, Japan)."
6,Evaluation of photocatalytic properties,"2.5 Evaluation of photocatalytic properties The absorption spectra of the methylene blue (MB) concentration (0.01 mM) at the characteristic absorption band of 670 nm was measured via a UV–Vis DRS. The photodecomposition rate of as-prepared MoS2 nanoflakes and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures with different amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes defined as C/C0 under visible light (400 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter) irradiation at room temperature for 3 h, which C0 and C were the initial and instantaneous concentrations of MB solution. Photocatalytic hydrogen production of the as-prepared MoS2 nanoflakes and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures with different amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes (50 mg) estimated by using 100 mL de-ionized water with 0.1 M sodium sulfide (Na2S) as a sacrificial reagent under visible light (400 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter) irradiation at room temperature. The amount of hydrogen evolution was determined by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detector. The hydrogen evolution rate was compared by the average hydrogen evolution rate for 3 h."
7,Results and discussion,
8,The morphology and crystal structures of MoS2 nanoflakes,"3.1 The morphology and crystal structures of MoS2 nanoflakes The morphology and characteristics of as-prepared MoS2 nanoflakes were analyzed via FESEM and FETEM, respectively. Fig. 1 a shows the FESEM image of MoS2 nanoflakes synthesized through a hydrothermal method, which has agglomerated into sub-microspheres. The size of the sub-microspheres is about 0.3–1.5 μm. The FETEM image (Fig. 1b) can more clearly show that MoS2 sub-microspheres are composed of a large number of MoS2 nanoflakes. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1c) indicates that MoS2 nanoflakes are the polycrystalline diffraction rings. The diffraction spots are arranged on the concentric rings, which could be assigned to the hexagonal-phase MoS2 (JCPDS No. 65-1951). The HRTEM image (Fig. 1d) exhibits that the MoS2 nanoflakes possess distinct lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.614 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of the hexagonal-phase MoS2 (JCPDS No. 65-1951). Elemental mapping images were carried out via EDS to investigate the elemental dispersion on the MoS2 nanoflakes. Fig. 1e shows that the elements Mo and S distribute uniformly on the MoS2 nanoflakes, which confirms the successful synthesis of the MoS2 nanoflakes."
9,The morphology and crystal structures of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures,"3.2 The morphology and crystal structures of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures Fig. 2 shows that the MoS2/ZnO heterostructures have been prepared at the different amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes through a wet chemistry method at 90 °C for 2 h. The amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes were 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 g, respectively. It is clearly observed that MoS2 nanoflakes have been decorated with ZnO nanoflakes. In order to investigate the influence of the different amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes on the MoS2/ZnO heterostructures, the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) analyzer was used to evaluate their specific surface areas. The specific surface areas of MoS2 nanoflakes and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures with different amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes were estimated to be 8.84 (MoS2 nanoflakes), 25.79 (0.01 g MoS2 nanoflakes), 28.08 (0.02 g MoS2 nanoflakes), 29.03 (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes), and 20.15 m2 g−1 (0.04 g MoS2 nanoflakes), respectively. As the amounts of the MoS2 nanoflakes increased, the specific surface areas of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures were gradually improved. When the quantities of MoS2 nanoflakes were more than 0.03 g, the MoS2/ZnO heterostructures shall be aggregated with each other to reduce their specific surface areas. The crystal structures of MoS2 nanoflakes and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) were clearly revealed by XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 3 . For MoS2 nanoflakes (Fig. 3a), the four peaks appeared at 2θ value of 14.4°, 32.7°, 39.6°, and 58.3°, which can be attributed to (002), (100), (103), and (110) crystal faces of the hexagonal-phase of MoS2 (JCPDS No. 65-1951), respectively. For MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (Fig. 3b), the eight peaks appeared at 2θ value of 31.7°, 34.4°, 36.2°, 47.5°, 56.5°, 62.8°, 67.9°, and 69.0°, which can be ascribed to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), and (201) crystal faces of the hexagonal-phase of ZnO (JCPDS No. 89-1397), respectively. Fig. 4 a displays the TEM image of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes), which was composed of a large number of nanoflakes. The SAED pattern (Fig. 4b) indicates that MoS2/ZnO heterostructures are polycrystalline structure. The diffraction spots arranged on the concentric rings could be assigned to the hexagonal MoS2 phase (JCPDS No. 24-0513) and ZnO phase (JCPDS No. 89-1397), respectively. Fig. 4c shows the HRTEM image of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures, in which the interplanar d-spacing of 0.614 and 0.261 nm corresponded to (002) plane of hexagonal-phase MoS2 (JCPDS No. 65-1951) and (002) plane of hexagonal-phase of ZnO (JCPDS No. 89-1397), respectively. Fig. 4d shows the EDS mapping images of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures were Mo, S, Zn, and O, respectively. It can be clearly obtained that the composition of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures is matched well."
10,The photocatalytic performance of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures,"3.3 The photocatalytic performance of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures The photodecomposition rate of MoS2 nanoflakes and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures was estimated by the decomposition of MB solution under visible light irradiation shown in Fig. 5 a. The photodecomposition rate of as-prepared MoS2 nanoflakes and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures with different amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes were 4.3 (blank, without photocatalysts), 45.6 (MoS2 nanoflakes), 76.4 (0.01 g MoS2 nanoflakes), 87.6 (0.02 g MoS2 nanoflakes), 93.8 (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes), and 70.5% (0.04 g MoS2 nanoflakes), respectively. The introduction of ZnO as a co-catalyst can be significantly improved the photocatalytic activity of MoS2 nanoflakes. This result is consistent with the order of specific surface areas (MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g) > MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.02 g) > MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.01 g) > MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.04 g) > MoS2 nanoflakes). The reaction rate constants for photodecomposition of MB solution via as-prepared MoS2 nanoflakes and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures with different amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes were evaluated by a pseudo-first-order model: −ln(C/C 0 ) = kt where C0 and C were the concentrations of MB before and after the photocatalytic experiment, respectively. Fig. 5b shows the reaction rate constants were 0.00067 (blank, without photocatalysts), 0.00611 (MoS2 nanoflakes), 0.00837 (0.01 g MoS2 nanoflakes), 0.01194 (0.02 g MoS2 nanoflakes), 0.01579 (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes), and 0.00667 min−1 (0.04 g MoS2 nanoflakes), respectively. The reaction rate constant of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) is about 2.58 times that of MoS2 nanoflakes. The repeated MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) were washed directly with de-ionized water and ethanol and collected via centrifugation at 3000 rpm 15 min. Finally, the repeated MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) dried at 70 °C after each cycle. The reusability of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) was 100, 97.0, 99.1, 95.0, and 96.2% for the five cycles shown in Fig. 5c. The results reveal that there is no apparent difference in the photodecomposition of MB solution for five cycles. These results confirmed that the prepared MoS2/ZnO heterostructures could be used for a long-term photodecomposition process. There were added radical scavengers to photocatalytic reaction for understanding their photocatalytic mechanism. Herein, triethanolamine (TEOA), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and benzoquinone (BQ) were used as radical scavengers to quench holes (h+) hydroxyl radicals (·OH), and superoxide radical anions (·O2 −), respectively [35]. Fig. 5d reveals three kinds of radical scavengers that accompanied the variation of photodecomposition rate of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes). It is evident that with no radical scavengers, the photodecomposition rate of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) was 93.8%. When the photocatalytic reaction added radical scavengers of TEOA, IPA, and BQ, the photodecomposition rate of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) reduced to 48.2, 45.4, and 44.6, respectively. This result demonstrates that h+, ·OH, and ·O2 − are three main reasonable active species for the photodecomposition of MB solution. Photocatalytic hydrogen production of the as-prepared MoS2 nanoflakes and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures with different amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes estimated under visible light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 6 a. The hydrogen evolution rate (HER) was 0 (blank, without photocatalysts), 53.3 (MoS2 nanoflakes), 80 (0.01 g MoS2 nanoflakes), 83.4 (0.02 g MoS2 nanoflakes), 145.6 (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes), and 64.2 μmolh−1g−1L−1 (0.04 g MoS2 nanoflakes), respectively. This result is also consistent with the order of specific surface areas (MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g) > MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.02 g) > MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.01 g) > MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.04 g) > MoS2 nanoflakes). MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) exhibited a higher specific surface area to enhance their photocatalytic activity. This high HER of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures is in comparison with other literature (Table 1 ), such as MoS2/ZnO composite photocatalysts [36,37], MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres [15], and Bi2O3/MoS2 heterojunctions [38]. The repeated MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) were washed directly with de-ionized water and ethanol and collected via centrifugation at 3000 rpm 15 min. Finally, the repeated MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) dried at 70 °C after each cycle. The HER was also not exhibited any significant loss after five recycles, as shown in Fig. 6b. This result demonstrates that the MoS2/ZnO heterostructures were very stable during long-term photocatalytic processes."
11,The photocatalytic mechanism of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures,"3.4 The photocatalytic mechanism of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures Fig. 7 a displays the UV–vis DRS spectra of MoS2 nanoflakes and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures with different amounts of MoS2 nanoflakes. The MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes) exhibited a stronger absorption between 400 and 1100 nm. This result revealed that the integration of MoS2 with ZnO could significantly improve the light-harvesting ability of heterostructures. Fig. 7b shows the PL spectra of ZnO nanoflakes (No MoS2 nanoflakes) and MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes). For the UV emission peak at 374 nm (3.32 eV), the intensity of ZnO nanoflakes exhibited the stronger than MoS2/ZnO heterostructures (0.03 g MoS2 nanoflakes). This phenomenon was attributed to the photogenerated charge-carrier transfer between MoS2 and ZnO, effectively reducing the photogenerated electron/hole pairs recombination. The synergistic mechanism of MoS2/ZnO heterostructures is proposed in Fig. 7c. Under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons are transported from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of MoS2. Due to the CB edge potential of ZnO (– 0.32 V) located higher than MoS2 (– 0.485 V), the electrons in the CB of MoS2 could transfer into the CB of ZnO [15,39]. Since the CB of ZnO is more negative than O2/O2·– (−0.046 eV), the e– shall be reacted with O2 molecules to produce O2·– for decomposed MB solution [40,41]. The photogenerated h+ in the VB of MoS2 nanoflakes shall be directly reacted with MB solution or indirectly reacted with H2O to form OH· for decomposed MB solution."
12,Conclusions,"A simple wet chemistry approach is employed to fabricate MoS2/ZnO heterostructures, which can be used as efficient visible-light-induced photocatalysts applied in wastewater treatment and water splitting. This result is ascribed to enhance the light-harvesting ability, the separation of charge carriers, and the specific surface areas on the MoS2/ZnO heterostructures. Moreover, MoS2/ZnO heterostructures revealed excellent visible-light photocatalytic stability and reusability. MoS2/ZnO heterostructures can provide a simple, low cost, high specific surface area, high photocatalytic efficiency, and reusability, which shall be helpful in many other related fields."
