0,Introduction,"Selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a highly important transformation in industrial applications because the obtained alkenes are the key building blocks for the synthesis of various fine chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, flavors, and natural products [1–4]. Generally, this transformation can be achieved under H2 atmosphere with a homogeneous (e.g. metal complexes) or heterogeneous (e.g. supported Pd, Ni, Cu, Au, and Ru metal nanoparticles) catalyst [5–8]. In industry, the Pd-based Lindlar catalyst is the most widely used heterogeneous catalyst for this transformation. However, the requirement of a toxic Pb salt (or quinoline) as an additive to deactivate the Pd sites is the main drawback of this kind of catalyst, which is against the principles of green chemistry [9,10]. Recently, supported Pd-based bimetallic catalysts have been proved to be promising candidates for the transformation of alkynes to alkenes [11–14] because the second metal can modify the geometric and electronic structures of the Pd nanoparticles, which can enhance the selectivity toward alkenes [15–19]. However, in some cases, the presence of excess H2 may cause the further reduction of alkenes into alkanes, especially after complete consumption of alkynes [20–22]. If supplying H2 in a controlled manner, it might be more feasible to enhance the selectivity during the transformation of alkynes to alkenes over the Pd-based bimetallic catalysts. Formic acid (FA), a renewable and nonflammable liquid, which can be produced from biomass conversion or CO2 reduction, has been proposed as a secure and convenient H2 source with a gravimetric hydrogen content of 4.4 wt% [23–25]. In the past, great efforts have been devoted to the H2 production from FA dehydrogenation (HCOOH → H2 + CO2) over various catalysts (e.g. supported Pd, Co, Au, and Pt catalysts) [25–30]. Among them, the Pd-based bimetallic catalysts are also considered as very promising candidates for effectively catalyzing the FA into a mixture of H2 and CO2 [31–36]. To utilize H2 effectively, it is often necessary to separate the H2/CO2 mixture before applications, but this can increase the operational costs significantly. We hypothesized that the CO2-diluted H2 generated from FA dehydrogenation could be used directly for the semihydrogenation of alkynes without the need for separation process, which might be beneficial to enhance the selectivity of alkenes. To achieve this, a two-chamber reactor connected with a tube, a portable and operationally simple setup for conducting a tandem reaction with dangerous gases on a laboratory scale [37–41], has been used to combine the semihydrogenation of alkynes and the FA dehydrogenation over Pd-based bimetallic catalysts. As shown in Scheme 1 and Fig. S1, one chamber is for FA dehydrogenation over the PdAg bimetallic catalyst; the other chamber is for semihydrogenation of alkynes over the PdZn bimetallic catalyst; the CO2-diluted H2 generated from FA dehydrogenation can diffuse across the connecting tube to participate in the semihydrogenation of alkynes. Based on this setup, the delivery of CO2-diluted H2 can be controlled by closing the valve in the two-chamber reactor or pulling the catalyst (if molding into monolith) out of the FA solution. It has been proved that the selectivities of alkenes via this setup exceed the results proceeded under pure H2 atmosphere, confirming the advantage of the CO2-diluted H2 atmosphere. The two-chamber reactor system is also broadly applicable to other catalytic hydrogenation systems."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. 3-aminophenol (3-AP), 1-ethyl-4-ethynylbenzene, and 4-Phenyl-1-butyne were obtained from J&K Chemicals Technology Co. Ltd. Pluronic F127 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), silver nitrate (AgNO3), FA, nitrobenzene, and benzaldehyde were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Phenylacetylene, diphenylacetylene, cis-stilbene, trans-stilbene n-dodecane, and potassium tetrachloropalladate (K2[PdCl4]) were obtained from Aladdin Reagent Co. (Shanghai, China)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Synthesis of Pd/NMP precursor (NMP: nitrogen-doped mesoporous polymer): typically, 0.36 g of 3-AP and 0.0157 g of K2PdCl4 (0.048 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. Then, 30 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.16 g of Pluronic F127 and 0.28 g of HMT was added under slow stirring. After stirring for 20 min, the mixed solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 120 mL capacity, sealed, and treated at 80 °C for 24 h. Afterward, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature. The soft polymer gel product was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and finally freeze-dried for 10 h. 2.2.1 Synthesis of PdAg/NMP-450 In a typical synthesis, the as-synthesized Pd/NMP precursor was redispersed in 50 mL of water containing a certain amount of Ag(NO3). After stirring for 2 h at room temperature, the product was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and finally freeze-dried for 10 h (Pd/NMP-precursor-Ag+). Then, the Pd/NMP-precursor-Ag+ converted into PdAg/NMP-450 after thermal reduction at 450 °C under an H2/Ar (10%/90%) atmosphere. A series of Pd1Agx/NMP-450 samples with different Pd to Ag molar ratios were prepared by using variable amount of AgNO3 (Pdmol: Agmol = 1:x). The thermal reduction procedure was as follows: the sample was heated in tube furnace to 200 °C with a rate of 2 °C per min and maintained at this temperature for 1 h, then heated to 360 °C with a rate of 1 °C per min and maintained at this temperature for 1 h, subsequently heated to 450 °C with a rate of 2 °C per min and maintained at this temperature for 2 h. Afterward, the sample was cooled down to room temperature and passivated in flowing 1% oxygen in Ar for 0.5 h. 2.2.2 Synthesis of PdZn/NMP-700 The synthesis procedure for PdZn/NMP-700 was very similar to that described previously, but using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O instead of AgNO3 and increasing thermal reduction temperature to 700 °C. All the Pd-based bimetallic catalysts were activated by the ozone air treatment and H2 reduction before using (removing the carbonaceous residues coated on the surface of metal nanoparticles). Briefly, the bimetallic sample was directly treated in the tube furnace at 180 °C for 2 h under the ozone air flow (generated using ambient air as gas resource by home ozone generator, OZX-300ST AC120V 60 Hz), followed by reduction at 300 °C under H2/Ar (10%/90%) for 1 h and passivation in flowing 1% oxygen in Ar for 0.5 h."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The morphology and structure analyses of the samples were investigated by Hitachi-S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Hitachi-7650 transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an acceleration voltage of 10.0 kV and 100 kV, respectively. High-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images and element mappings were acquired using FEI Talos F200S instrument with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and STEM attachments at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured at room temperature using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi system with monochromatic Al Kα as the excitation source. The textural properties of samples were determined by nitrogen sorption isotherms on a Micromeritics ASAP 3020 instrument at 77 K. Before the measurements, the sample was degassed at 200 °C for 6 h. The specific surface areas and pore size distribution curves were calculated from the desorption branch data using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method, respectively."
5,FA dehydrogenation,"2.4 FA dehydrogenation The FA dehydrogenation was performed in a two-necked round-bottomed flask with 10 mL capacity at temperatures of 303 K–333 K under an ambient atmosphere. A reflux condenser and a gas burette filled with water were connected with the flask. Briefly, 50 mg of the catalyst was added to the bottom of the flask, then FA aqueous solution (1 mL, 1.5 M) was injected into the flask using a syringe to initiate the reaction. The volume of the CO2-diluted H2 gas was measured by the electronic balance, which can continuously record the water mass flowing out of the gas burette. The initial turnover frequency (TOF) value was evaluated based on the following equation when the conversion of FA reached 10%: T O F = P a t m V g a s 2 R T n P d t where P atm = 101,325 Pa (the standard atmospheric pressure), R = 8.3145 m3 Pa/mol/K (the universal gas constant), T = 298 K, V gas and t are the initial volume of the released gas and the time when the FA conversion reached 10%, respectively; n Pd is the Pd mole in the catalyst."
6,Semihydrogenation of alkynes in the two-chamber reactor,"2.5 Semihydrogenation of alkynes in the two-chamber reactor The two-chamber reactor (a total volume of 20 mL) connected with a tube has been used to combine the FA dehydrogenation (chamber 1) and the semihydrogenation of alkynes (chamber 2). The CO2-diluted H2 can diffuse across the connected tube of the two-chamber reactor. Briefly, 50 mg of PdAg catalyst and 30 mg of PdZn catalyst were placed in the chamber 1 and chamber 2, respectively. Air in the two-chamber system was removed by vacuum. Then, 3 mL of ethanol containing 0.5 mmol of alkyne and a certain amount of dodecane (internal standard) was injected into the chamber 2, and 1 mL of FA solution (1.5 M) was injected into the chamber 1. After reaction for a certain time, the reaction mixture in the chamber 2 was collected and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Agilent 7890B-5977A equipped with an HP-5 column) and GC (Agilent 7890B equipped with an HP-5 column connected to a flame ionization detector) with dodecane as the internal standard."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The PdAg and PdZn bimetallic catalysts used in this work are prepared by the recently reported nanoreactor strategy [42]. The strategy is based on the coordination chemistry to successively introduce the Pd nanoclusters and the second metal precursor into the NMP. Subsequent thermal reduction allows the seeded growth of Pd-based bimetallic nanoparticles on the support of NMP. Briefly, Pd/NMP precursor (Fig. S2) containing the high-quality seeds of Pd nanoclusters is prepared by hydrothermal process using 3-AP and HMT as polymer precursor, F127 as surfactant, and K2PdCl4 as metal source. Then, the second metal ions (Ag+ or Zn2+) are homogenously introduced into the Pd/NMP precursor. Finally, the supported Pd-based bimetallic nanoparticles are obtained after a thermal reduction under H2/Ar atmosphere (Pd1Mx/NMP-t, where M represents Ag or Zn, 1/x is the molar ratio of Pd to M, and t is the temperature of thermal reduction). SEM image of the Pd1Ag1/2/NMP-450 shows that many macropores are formed because of the coral-like structure of the NMP support (Fig. 1 a), which should be of benefit to mass transfer during catalytic reaction. According to TEM image (Fig. 1b), STEM image (Fig. 1c), and EDX mapping analysis (Fig. 1d), the ultrafine PdAg bimetallic nanoparticles with an average particle size of 2.9 ± 0.7 nm (Fig. 1b, inset) are homogeneously distributed in the mesostructured NMP support. From the amplified STEM image and EDX mapping analysis (Fig. S3), the distributions of Pd and Ag elements almost overlap with each other, which, to some extent, indicates the formation of PdAg alloy phase. Without Pd nanoclusters as seeds, the Ag nanoparticles with a diameter larger than 5 nm are formed and unevenly dispersed in the NMP support (Fig. S4). The XRD pattern of Pd1Ag1/2/NMP-450 shows a broad and symmetric diffraction peak (111) that is present between the peaks of Pd/NMP-450 and Ag/NMP-450, also proving that Ag is incorporated into the Pd structure to form a PdAg alloy phase (Fig. S5a). The XPS of Pd1Ag1/2/NMP-450 (Fig. S5b) shows the existence of C, N, Pd, and Ag. In the Pd 3D region, the spectrum of Pd1Ag1/2/NMP-450 (Fig. S5c) is shifted to lower binding energy compared with the sample of Pd/NMP-450, further indicating the formation of PdAg bimetallic structure. According to the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrophotometer analysis (ICP-OES), the loading amounts of Pd and Ag are 2.1 wt% and 1.0 wt% (molar ratio of Pd to Ag is 1:0.47), respectively, which is in agreement with the molar ratio of Pd and Ag precursors used in synthesis. The N2 sorption isotherm of Pd1Ag1/2/NMP-450 (Fig. S5d) shows a type IV curve with a steep uptake at relative pressure p/p 0 > 0.9, indicating the existence of mesopores and macropores. The surface area and pore volume of Pd1Ag1/2/NMP-450 are 324 m2/g and 0.31 cm3/g, respectively. In addition, the supported PdZn bimetallic catalyst is also synthesized by the nanoreactor strategy. However, to enhance the PdZn alloy degree, the thermal reduction temperature increases to 700 °C. According to SEM image (Fig. 1e), Pd1Zn2/NMP-700 has the same structure as Pd1Ag1/2/NMP-450. TEM, STEM, and EDX mapping images of Pd1Zn2/NMP-700 (Fig. 1f–h) also reveal that the ultrafine PdZn nanoparticles with an average particle size of 3.4 ± 0.8 nm (Fig. 1f, inset) are homogeneously distributed on the NMP support. The XRD pattern and XPS spectrum of Pd1Zn2/NMP-700 (Figs. S6a–c) also confirm the formation of PdZn alloy phase. According to the ICP-OES analysis, the loading amounts of Pd and Zn are 2.2 wt% and 2.0 wt% (molar ratio of Pd to Ag is 1:1.5), respectively. The surface area and pore volume of Pd1Zn2/NMP-700 are 423 m2/g and 0.27 cm3/g, respectively (Fig. S6d). Remarkably, if necessary, the supported Pd1Mx/NMP-t product is very easy to be molded into monolith without any binders according to the method reported previously [42]."
9,FA dehydrogenation,"3.2 FA dehydrogenation To perform the two-chamber reactor system successfully, FA dehydrogenation (1.5 M, 1 mL) over the PdAg bimetallic catalysts with different Pd to Ag molar ratios is studied first without any additive under ambient atmosphere. In the beginning, using the NMP-450 (data not shown) and Ag/NMP-450 as catalysts, no FA dehydrogenation occurs (Fig. 2 a), whereas the Pd/NMP-450 shows an activity for FA dehydrogenation with a TOF value of 60 per hour (Fig. 2a and b). After introducing Ag into the monometallic Pd nanoparticles to form PdAg alloy phase, the catalytic activity for FA dehydrogenation is enhanced with the TOF value increasing to 131 per hour (Pd1Ag1/8/NMP-450) and 335 per hour (Pd1Ag1/4/NMP-450), respectively. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the electronic interaction between Pd and Ag in the PdAg bimetallic nanoparticles. Further increasing the Ag amount in the bimetallic products, the catalytic activities do not increase further, where the TOF values of Pd1Ag1/2/NMP-450 and Pd1Ag1/NMP-450 are 332 and 318 per hour, respectively. Therefore, the sample of Pd1Ag1/4/NMP-450 shows the best activity for FA dehydrogenation, over which 1.5 mmol of CO2-diluted H2 can be produced within 2 h at room temperature. In addition, no CO is detected in the CO2-diluted H2 gas, indicating an excellent H2 selectivity over the Pd1Ag1/4/NMP-450, and which avoids the CO-induced deactivation of bimetallic catalysts. When increasing the reaction temperature, the reaction rates over Pd1Ag1/4 sample are gradually enhanced with TOF values increasing to 488 per hour at 313 K, to 902 per hour at 323 K, and to 1,741 per hour at 333 K (Fig. 2c). The apparent activation energy (E a ) over Pd1Ag1/4 sample is estimated to be 45.5 kJ/mol within the temperature range of 303–333 K (Fig. 2d)."
10,Semihydrogenation of alkynes in the two-chamber reactor,"3.3 Semihydrogenation of alkynes in the two-chamber reactor The semihydrogenation of alkynes using ex situ H2 generated from FA dehydrogenation (Pd1Ag1/4/NMP-450 as catalyst) is performed in the two-chamber reactor (Table 1 ). In the beginning, semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene is chosen as a model reaction to evaluate the catalytic performances of the PdZn bimetallic catalysts in the two-chamber reactor. In the presence of Zn/NMP-700, almost no conversion of phenylacetylene occurs (Table 1, entry 1). When using Pd/NMP-700 as catalyst, 99% conversion of phenylacetylene is obtained within 5 h but with only 65% selectivity toward styrene (Table 1, entry 2). After introducing Zn into the monometallic Pd nanoparticles to form the PdZn alloy phase, the conversion of phenylacetylene decreases to 78% after reaction for 5 h over the Pd1Zn2/NMP-700 (Table 1, entry 3). However, the alkene selectivity increases gradually from 65% to 94%. Extending the reaction time to 6 h, 95% conversion of phenylacetylene with 92% selectivity toward styrene is obtained over the Pd1Zn2/NMP-700 (Table 1, entry 4). These results indicate that the overhydrogenation of alkynes can be suppressed by alloying Pd with Zn element, which is consistent with the work reported in the literature [10,43–45]. Further increasing the Zn amount, the conversion of phenylacetylene decreases slightly to 89% over the sample of Pd1Zn4/NMP-700, with 92% selectivity toward styrene (Table 1, entry 5). Therefore, among these PdZn bimetallic catalysts with different Pd to Zn molar ratios, the Pd1Zn2/NMP-700 shows the best catalytic performance for semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene. If replacing CO2-diluted H2 with pure H2 (via a balloon), the hydrogenation rate is enhanced dramatically, but with a lower selectivity to styrene (Table 1, entries 6, 7). These results indicate that the CO2-diluted H2 provided by the FA decomposition is enough for semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene and is beneficial for enhancing the selectivity to styrene. In addition, various solvents are also evaluated for the transformation of phenylacetylene to styrene in the two-chamber reactor. It is found that the catalytic performance in ethanol is better than those of cyclohexane, acetonitrile, and toluene (Table S1). The two-chamber reactor system using Pd1Ag1/4/NMP-450 and Pd1Zn2/NMP-700 as catalysts is also applicable for semihydrogenation of other alkynes. As an example, the terminal alkyne, 1-ethyl-4-ethynylbenzene, is selectively hydrogenated into the corresponding terminal alkene in the two-chamber reactor with 93% selectivity at 97% conversion (Table 1, entry 8). For semihydrogenation of the internal alkynes of diphenylacetylene (Table 1, entries 9), almost full conversions are obtained with selectivity of 96% to stilbene (cis/trans = 96:4). Therefore, the two-chamber reactor system is very convenient and highly efficient for selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with high selectivity. Moreover, the system can be further extended to other hydrogenation reactions. For example, based on the two-chamber reactor system, the substrates of nitrobenzene and benzaldehyde are fully converted into aniline and benzyl alcohol, respectively, with selectivities higher than 99% (Table 1, entries 10, 11). In addition, the reusability of the catalysts in the two-chamber reactor system was also investigated using phenylacetylene as substrate. To make the recycling tests easier, the catalysts of Pd1Ag1/4/NMP-450 and Pd1Zn2/NMP-700 were molded into monolith without any binders by the method reported previously [42]. For each run, the reaction was carried out at 333 K using 50 mg of the monolithic Pd1Ag1/4-NMP-450 for FA dehydrogenation and 50 mg of the monolithic Pd1Zn2-NMP-700 for semihydrogenation of alkynes in the two-chamber reactor. After reaction, the two catalysts were separated easily, washed with ethanol, and dried completely at 70 °C for 3 h. In this way, the two monolithic catalysts were recycled for four times without considerable changes in conversion of phenylacetylene and selectivity toward styrene (Fig. S7), indicating the high reusability of the monolithic catalysts as well as the two-chamber reactor system."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, we have developed a two-chamber reactor for semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes over the supported PdZn bimetallic catalyst using ex situ H2 generated from FA dehydrogenation over the supported PdAg bimetallic catalyst. Benefiting from the CO2-diluted H2 atmosphere and the synergistic effect of the bimetallic catalysts, efficient utilization of H2 and selective transformation of alkynes to alkenes are achieved in the two-chamber reactor system. It is believed that the two-chamber reactor using supported bimetallic nanoparticles as catalysts is valuable for hydrogenation reactions and can be extended to various chemical transformations involving other gases than H2."
