0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde into crotyl alcohol is an important process in fine chemicals, pharmaceutical and fragrance industries [1,2]. However, hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde usually goes through various pathways [3–5]. More importantly, the hydrogenation tends to take place at the CC bond instead of the CO bond due to thermodynamic and kinetic factors [6–8], and thus leading to the formation of saturated aldehyde (butanal). Thus, development of catalysts that are highly active and selective remains challenging in the catalysis field [9–12]. Great efforts have been made to develop catalyst systems for the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Noble metal catalysts are usually employed in this reaction. For example, Pt catalysts have been intensively studied, such as Pt/TiO2 [6], Pt/α-Ga2O3 [13], Pt/ZrO2/TiO2 [14], Pt/ZnO [15], Pt/SnO2 [16], Pt/CeO2 [17]. In addition, gold catalysts also have been widely used in this reaction, such as Au/TiO2 [18], Au/SiO2 [19], Au/ZnO [20], Au/CeO2 [21], Au/ZrO2 [22]. Although most attention has been devoted to Pt and Au catalysts, Ir catalysts have been studied in selective hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes in recent years, such as crotonaldehyde [23–25] and citral [26–29]. For example, gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde on 5% Ir/TiO2 resulted in selectivity to crotyl alcohol of 70% at 20–80% conversion [25]. Reyes et al. [30] studied in detail the interfacial properties of an Ir/TiO2 catalyst and concluded that the interfacial metal–TiO x moieties created upon reduction treatment was responsible for the increase in activity and in selectivity to crotyl alcohol. Rojas et al. [23,24] reported the catalytic performance of Ir/TiO2 SiO2 catalysts for the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and pointed out that the reduction temperature (500°C) induced the strong metal support interaction effect (SMSI), which improved the Ir catalyst activity and selectivity towards crotyl alcohols. According to the published literatures, it can be seen that high reduction temperature is beneficial to the catalytic performance of Ir catalysts, and the reason is usually attributed to the surface decoration of the metal component from its reducible oxide supports, i.e. the strong metal support interaction (SMSI). However, there are still some contradictions in the results of the activity of Ir catalysts and selectivity to crotyl alcohol, especially the essential effects of some key factors on the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation are not clear, such as the morphologies and electronic properties of the active metals, the surface Lewis acid sites, and the residual chlorine ions in the catalyst. Enhanced activity and selectivity to the desired crotyl alcohol could be achieved by modification of the active metals when varying the reduction temperature, by which the morphologies and electronic properties of the active metals could be properly adjusted for the hydrogenation of the CO bond [31–35]. Surface Lewis acid sites could be generated from the reducible oxide support such as TiO2 and the use of chlorine-containing metal precursors such as H2PtCl6, which are crucial for the selectivity, as it was reported that the surface Lewis acid sites could enhance the adsorption strength of the CO bond, thus resulting in the promotion of selectivity to crotyl alcohol [15,36]. As for the influence of presence of chlorine ions, they also have an important impact on the catalytic behaviors of Ir catalysts, for the remained Cl− can not only directly influence the support acidic properties, but also probably influence the surface electronic properties of the Ir catalysts, however, such vital effect of remained Cl− is still not be carefully identified until now. In this work, a series of Ir/TiO2 catalysts were prepared and tested for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The effect of reduction pretreatment on the catalyst properties and consequently catalytic behaviors was investigated in detail. More attentions were paid to three essential factors that could influence the catalytic behaviors of Ir/TiO2 catalysts: (1) the morphologies and electronic properties of Ir catalysts, (2) the acidic properties of the TiO2 support, (3) the amount of remaining Cl−. In the end, the relationship between the catalyst property and catalytic behavior was discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Degussa P25 (90% anatase and 10% rutile) with a surface area of 62.9m2 g−1 was dried at 100°C for 12h under vacuum before use. Supported Ir/TiO2 catalysts with a nominal Ir content of 3wt% were prepared by impregnating the TiO2 support with an aqueous solution of H2IrCl6. In a typical preparation, 1.358g of the TiO2 support was impregnated with 6ml of H2IrCl6 (Ir content=7gL−1) aqueous solution for 12h, and the mixture was dried overnight at 90°C. The catalysts were reduced at different temperature before reaction (see section 2.3). For comparison, a supported Ir/SiO2 catalyst was also prepared in a similar manner. The catalysts were denoted as Ir/TiO2-X and Ir/SiO2-X (X=100, 200, 300, 400 and 500), where X refers to the reduction temperature."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations As the catalysts were reduced before the reaction, all the characterizations were carried out following the reduction procedure in order to obtain intrinsic information of the catalyst. The catalysts were reduced in H2 at different temperatures (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500°C) for 1h prior to characterization, except for the hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytic X’Pert PW3040 diffractiometer with Cu Kα radiation operating at 40kV and 40mA. The patterns were collected in a 2θ range from 20° to 80°. Elemental compositions of the reduced catalysts were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, on an ARLADVANT’X Intelli Power 4200 scanning X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The results were analyzed using UniQuant non-standard sample quantitative analysis software. Surface areas of the catalysts were determined by the modified BET method from the N2 sorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature (−195.7°C) on an Autosorb-1 apparatus. The samples were heated at 100°C for 4h under vacuum before measurement. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed on a JEM-2100F microscopy with a field emissive gun, operated at 200kV and with a point resolution of 0.24nm. The samples were prepared by dispersing a few milligrams of powder in ethanol. The dispersion was then immersed for 10min in an ultrasonic bath in order to disagglomerate the powder particles. Finally, one drop was deposited on a Formvar/carbon copper grid. Various regions of the grid were observed and the particle sizes were measured from the observation of 250–500 particles. The redox properties of the catalysts were measured by hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments. 50mg of sample was placed in a quartz tubular reactor (i.d.=6mm) and pretreated in a flow of N2 (30mlmin−1) at 100°C for 1h, and then cooled to room temperature. After that the sample was heated from room temperature to 700°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 in a H2–N2 gas mixture (5vol% H2, 30mlmin−1). The hydrogen consumption during the reduction was determined by a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was conducted on a home-made apparatus. 50mg of catalyst was loaded in a quartz tubular reactor (i.d.=6mm) prior to the measurement, and was in situ reduced in a H2–Ar mixture at different temperatures for 1h. Then it was cooled down to 50°C. A flow of NH3 was introduced for 30min. The gaseous or physisorbed NH3 was removed by purging Ar flow at 100°C for 90min. Then the sample was heated to 700°C with a ramp of 10°Cmin−1. The desorbed NH3 was monitored continuously via a TCD detector. The total amount of NH3 desorbed was determined by reaction with an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid and back titration with sodium hydroxide solution. The sensitive indicator contains a mixture of 0.1% brom-cresol green ethanol solution and 0.2% methyl red ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 3:1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using a VG ESCALAB MK-2 spectrometer with Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV). The voltage and power for the measurements were 12.5kV and 250W, respectively. The vacuum in the test chamber during the collection of spectra was kept 2×10−8 Pa. The samples were reduced in situ in H2 in the chamber of this equipment at different temperatures (100, 200, 300, 400, 500°C) and once the solid was outgassed, it was transported to the analysis chamber. The spectra obtained, once the background was removed, were fitted to Lorentzian and Gaussian lines to obtain the number of components, peak position, and their areas. The adventitious C 1s line at 284.6eV was used as an internal standard. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of the samples were recorded using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector and a DRIFTS (Harrick, CHC-CHA-3). Prior to the measurement, the sample was in situ reduced in a H2–Ar mixture (20mlmin−1, 10vol% H2) at different reaction temperatures (100, 200, 300, 400, 500°C) for 1h. After that, the sample was cooled down to 30°C and a flow of Ar (30mlmin−1) was fed to remove the residual H2. Then the sample was exposed to CO–Ar mixture (30mlmin−1, 1vol% CO) for 30min. Finally, the sample was purged by Ar for another 30min and the spectra were recorded. In all cases the spectra were taken at 30°C, with a resolution of 4cm−1 and cumulative 32 scans."
4,Activity testing,"2.3 Activity testing Gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was performed in a fixed bed reaction system at atmospheric pressure, using a quartz tube (8mm i.d.) reactor. About 100mg of the catalyst was loaded in the reactor with a thermal couple placed in the middle of the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. Before running the catalyst test, the catalyst was reduced at different temperatures (100, 200, 300, 400, 500°C) for 1h in ultra-pure H2 flow (99.999%, 20mlmin−1) and then it was cooled down to 80°C. Crotonaldehyde was introduced in a trap set maintained at 0°C before to achieve a constant crotonaldehyde partial pressure (1.06kPa), then aldehyde at constant partial pressure was carried over the catalyst by hydrogen flow (26mlmin−1). The gas line was kept at about 50°C to avoid any condensation. The reaction products and reactant were analyzed on line using a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-Wax column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm) capillary column."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Compositions and textures of Ir/TiO2 catalysts,"3.1 Compositions and textures of Ir/TiO2 catalysts XRD patterns of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts (not shown) show that the diffraction peaks of all the catalysts are similar to that of the TiO2 support and no diffraction peaks due to Ir, IrCl3 or IrO x are observed, indicating that the Ir species are highly dispersed on the catalysts. Table 1 lists specific surface areas of the catalysts, as well as Ir and Cl contents, as analyzed by XRF. It is found that the Ir contents in all catalysts are close to the nominal Ir values. Also, Cl element is detected in the Ir/TiO2 catalysts, but its content declines with increasing reduction temperature. In contrast, there is no Cl element detected in the Ir/SiO2 catalysts. This indicates that Cl species could stably exist in the Ir/TiO2 catalysts but be completed removed in the Ir/SiO2 catalyst. The BET surface areas of the catalysts hardly change for the Ir/TiO2 catalysts, ranging from about 54 to 65m2 g−1. Fig. 1 shows representative HRTEM images of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts reduced at different temperatures. Based on these images, distribution of Ir particles is estimated. It is found that the Ir particle sizes in the catalysts slightly increase with reduction temperature, mainly in the range of 1–2nm. These findings are in good agreement with the XRD results, suggesting that the Ir particles are highly dispersed in the catalyst."
7,Redox properties of Ir/TiO2 catalysts,"3.2 Redox properties of Ir/TiO2 catalysts Fig. 2 shows the H2-TPR profiles of TiO2, Ir/TiO2 and Ir/SiO2 catalysts. It is found that no reduction peak is observed in the temperature range of 50–700°C for the TiO2 support, indicating that single component TiO2 cannot be reduced by H2. For the Ir/SiO2 catalyst, two peaks with maxima at about 190°C (β) and 405°C (γ) are observed, which could be assigned to the consecutive reduction of IrCl x species to Ir0. For the Ir/TiO2 catalyst, three peaks centered at about 115°C (α), 175°C (β) and 350°C (γ) are observed [37]. The α peak could be assigned to the reduction of Ir cations that are not in close contact with the TiO2 support. Compared with the Ir/SiO2 catalyst, the β and γ peaks shift to lower temperatures on the Ir/TiO2 catalyst (175 and 350°C, respectively). The low-temperature shift of the β and γ peaks suggests an easier reduction of the Ir/TiO2 catalyst compared to the Ir/SiO2. Moreover, the peak area of the Ir/TiO2 catalyst (1083a.u.) is larger than that of the Ir/SiO2 (860a.u.), implying the co-reduction of TiO2 during the process, due to a typical spillover effect [37,38]. This indicates a strong interaction between Ir species and the TiO2 support [37]. Thus, the β and γ peaks of the Ir/TiO2 catalyst could be assigned to the reduction of IrCl x species with different interaction strength with the TiO2 support and partially the contacting TiO2 with these IrCl x species."
8,Surface acidity of Ir/TiO2 catalysts,"3.3 Surface acidity of Ir/TiO2 catalysts Fig. 3 shows the NH3-TPD profiles and the amounts of acid sites of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts reduced at the different temperatures. It can be seen that the TiO2 support reduced at 300°C shows no obvious desorption peak, suggesting that the TiO2 support has rare surface acidic sites. For the Ir/TiO2 catalysts, desorption peaks of NH3 are detected, indicating the Lewis acid sites generated by the residual chlorine ions on the catalyst surface [15,39]. The Ir/TiO2-100 catalyst has two NH3 desorption peaks at around 300°C (α) and 460°C (β), assigning to the weak and strong surface acid sites, respectively. With increasing reduction temperature, the intensities of the α and β peaks decline and the peak positions shift to lower temperature. This indicates that both the strength and the amount of surface acid sites decrease as reduction temperature increases. This phenomenon could be interpreted by the decreasing chlorine content with increasing reduction temperature. These results indicate that catalysts with high acidity in the range of strong acid sites (400–550°C) are obtained by the reduction of these samples, and that this acidity decreases with the reduction temperature."
9,XPS analysis of Ir/TiO2 catalysts,"3.4 XPS analysis of Ir/TiO2 catalysts Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of Ir4f core level of Ir/TiO2 catalysts after in situ reduction treatment at different temperatures. The detailed Ir0 and Ir δ+ surface atomic content determined by XPS are also listed in Fig. 4. In the same region appears a peak due to Ti3s, and therefore the spectra are complex. It is found that the peaks may be deconvoluted in two components, one corresponding to Ir0 at about 60.7–61.0eV and the other assigned to a partially oxidized Ir δ+ at about 62.3–62.7 [40]. As can be seen in Fig. 4, A shift toward lower binding energies of the Ir0 peaks accompanied by a simultaneous decline in the binding energy of the Ir δ+ species is observed with increasing reduction temperature, which can be attributed to the increase in the electron density of Ir due to gradual formation of Ir0 at elevated reduction temperature. This is evidenced by the surface analysis as the Ir0/Ir δ+ ratio increases with the reduction temperature."
10,In situ DRIFTS of CO chemisorption on Ir/SiO2-300 and Ir/TiO2 catalysts,"3.5 In situ DRIFTS of CO chemisorption on Ir/SiO2-300 and Ir/TiO2 catalysts Fig. 5 shows the in situ DRIFT spectra of CO adsorbed at 30°C on the Ir/TiO2 catalysts reduced at different temperatures as well as the Ir/SiO2-300 catalyst. For the Ir/SiO2 catalyst, one band at ca. 2060cm−1 is observed, which could be assigned to linearly adsorbed CO species (LCO) on Ir0 sites [41,42]. For the Ir/TiO2 catalysts, two types of adsorbed CO species have been reported in literature: linear CO (LCO) and gem dicarbonyls (GCO). Bourane et al. observed a strong peak at 2044cm−1 that was assigned to LCO species on fully reduced Ir sites [43]. Also, GCO species can accommodate the simultaneous adsorption of two CO molecules [43,44], with a band at around 2080cm−1 due to the symmetric dicarbonyl vibration and a band at ca. 2010cm−1 band due to the antisymmetric carbonyl vibration [44–46]. In our experiment, the peak at ca. 2045cm−1 is assigned to LCO species adsorbed on Ir0 sites. The peak position of this band shifts to lower wavenumbers (from 2045 to 2037cm−1) with increasing reduction temperature, which is due to the higher reduction temperature brings an increase in the electron density of Ir [43,47]. A pair of peaks at ca. 2089 and 2008cm−1 are could be assigned to GCO species on Ir δ+ sites [44,48]. The band at around 2089cm−1 is due to the symmetric dicarbonyl vibration and the ca. 2008cm−1 band is due to the antisymmetric carbonyl vibration [44]. Furthermore, it is found that with increasing reduction temperature, the adsorption of CO on the Ir δ+ surface species decreases but the adsorption of CO on the Ir0 surface species increases, indicating a lowered surface Ir δ+/Ir0 ratio with reduction temperature. As the Ir δ+ species are in form of IrCl x , the decreasing content of Ir δ+ species is accompanied with a declined content of Cl, which is consistent with the element composition analysis (Table 1). The small band just above ca. 2109cm−1 is assigned to linear CO adsorbed on Ir cations [44,49,50]. For the Ir/TiO2-200 and Ir/TiO2-300 catalysts, the peak at ca.1966cm−1 was observed which can be assigned to bridge CO (BCO) adsorbed on supported Ir0 sites [45]. The presence of these bands on the Ir/TiO2 catalysts shows that Ir sites strongly chemisorb CO at room temperature, which may explain the enhanced activity over the Ir/TiO2 catalysts as they provide more active sites for the reaction compared to the Ir/SiO2 catalyst."
11,Ir/TiO2 catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde,"3.6 Ir/TiO2 catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde Fig. 6 shows the crotonaldehyde conversion and selectivity to hydrogenation products as a function of reaction time over the Ir/TiO2 catalysts reduced at different temperatures. The products are crotyl alcohol (hydrogenation of the carbonyl CO bond), butanal (hydrogenation of the CC bond), butanol (hydrogenation of the CO and CC bands) and others (mainly C3 compounds formed by decarbonylation and C8 compounds formed by polymerization). It can be seen that the catalysts reduced at 200, 300 and 400°C have very high initial reactivities (>80%) while those reduced at 100 and 500°C have relatively low initial reactivities (<45%). However, all the catalysts deactivate during the reaction, but a quasi-state is obtained after 500min, with the Ir/TiO2-300 possessing the highest activity (26.9%) after 500min. As for the selectivity to crotyl alcohol, it increases rapidly during the first 60min reaction and then reaches a stable level. The catalysts reduced at temperature higher than 200°C have similar selectivities to crotyl alcohol (about 70%), but the selectivity first increases with reduction temperature and then slightly decreases. On the other hand, only less than 30% selectivity to crotyl alcohol is obtained on the Ir/TiO2-100. Table 2 lists crotonaldehyde conversions, TOFs and product selectivities over the Ir/TiO2 catalysts reduced at different temperatures. As can be seen in Table 2, with increasing reduction temperature, the conversion of crotonaldehyde, TOF and selectivity to crotyl alcohol and butanol first increase and then decrease, with an optimal reduction temperature of 300°C. However, the selectivities to butanal and others follow an opposite trend. Moreover, it is found that Ir/TiO2 catalyst has better catalytic performance compared to the Ir/SiO2 catalyst."
12,Reaction model,"3.7 Reaction model In the current work, a series of Ir/TiO2 catalysts are tested for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and it is found that the reduction pretreatment has great influence on the catalytic behaviors of these catalysts. Therefore, an interpretation is needed in order to illustrate the catalytic behaviors of these catalysts. It is commonly agreed that the catalytic behavior of the catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde depends on the adsorption model of the reactant, which is remarkably affected by the surface properties of the catalysts. The results in the current work indicate that the reduced catalyst contains Ir0 and Ir δ+ species, and the Ir0/Ir δ+ ratio increases with reduction temperature. Therefore, according to the results reported in literature [30,36,51–53] and the feature of the catalysts employed in the current work, an adsorption model of crotonaldehyde on Ir/TiO2 catalyst is proposed, as shown in Scheme 1 . The carbonyl oxygen is suggested to interact with Lewis acid sites (σ2) and the metallic Ir0 particles are the adsorption centers of CC (π) and carbonyl carbon (σ1). This model is also similar to the proposals of Reyes et al. [30] that the reaction takes place at the metal–support interface, and the activity and selectivity of the catalyst depends on the nature of these bonds (σ1, σ2 and π). Concerning the activity, it is found that all the catalysts suffered severe deactivation during the reaction. Deactivation is commonly observed in various catalysts for this reaction, mainly due to the high surface acidity of the catalyst which would cause a rapid coke formation and consequently block of active sites [54]. In the case of Ir/TiO2 catalyst, Reyes et al. attributed the deactivation to the formation of strongly chemisorbed asymmetric carboxylate and the formation of productions with conjugated CO and CC bonds, by using in situ DRIFT method [30]. This is supported by the findings in this work that C8 by-products are detected during the reaction (Table 2). Also, according to the NH3-TPD results (Fig. 3), the acidity of the catalysts decreases with increasing reduction temperature, due to the gradual removal of chlorine species at elevated temperature. For the Ir/TiO2-100 catalyst, note that it has a high Ir δ+/Ir0 ratio, which results in strong surface Lewis acid sites due to the high amount of residual chlorine species in the catalyst. These strong surface Lewis acid sites would interact with the carbonyl oxygen through the σ2 bond, and thus makes the chemisorbed crotonaldehyde molecules difficult to desorb and thus block the active sites and suppress the activity. On the contrary, for the catalyst reduced at high temperature (e.g. 500°C), although the σ2 bond is less intense due to the weak acidity, a strong interaction between the Ir0 sites and the carbonyl carbon (σ1) may form. This strong σ1 bond also makes the desorption of crotonaldehyde difficult, which may be responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. Meanwhile, the high temperature (e.g. 500°C) reduction may result in partial coverage of Ir particles by the TiO2 support due to a strong metal support interaction (SMSI), which was observed in Pt/TiO2 and PtSn/TiO2 systems by Huidobro et al. [55]. Therefore, appropriate strengths of the σ1 and σ2 bondings are necessary for the chemisorption and activation of crotonaldehyde molecules. In this case, the Ir/TiO2-300 catalyst with medium surface acidity and electron density on Ir0 due to a proper Ir0/Ir δ+ may be suitable for the chemisorption and activation of the crotonaldehyde molecule, and thus leading to a high activity. On the other hand, small amounts of C3 by-products are formed, indicating a decarbonylation reaction [3]. It was reported that decarbonylation and the irreversible adsorption of CO on the metal surface (such as Pt) is the reason for the loss of activity [3,4,36,56] due to a poisoning effect. Thus, the strong adsorption of CO molecules on the Ir species as revealed by DRIFTS results (Fig. 5) may also responsible for the deactivation, because it could block the active Ir sites. As for the selectivity to crotyl alcohol, it is found that it first increases and then decreases with reduction temperature. The average selectivities (about 70%) obtained on the catalysts (except for the Ir/TiO2-100 catalyst) are higher than those reported in literature [30,57]. The main difference between the catalysts in the current work and those in literature [30,57] is that the former are not calcined during the preparation while the latter were calcined at 400°C for 4h. Although little information about the element composition of the catalyst was given in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that these catalysts reported in literature contained very small amount of chlorine species as they could be almost completely removed by high temperature calcination, which would result in weak surface Lewis acidity. It is well known that the surface Lewis acidity plays an important role in the selectivity because these acid sites provide centers for carbonyl oxygen chemisorption, which is crucial for the formation of the desirable crotyl alcohol (although it may cause the catalyst deactivation as mentioned above). However, according to the adsorption model presented in Scheme 1, too strong Lewis acid sites may not beneficial for the selectivity because it could also result in a strong interaction between CC bond and the Ir0 sites (π bond in Scheme 1). Also, it was reported that in fact, a too large amount of chlorine at the catalyst surface leads to a detrimental additional reaction, chlorinated products can be formed and then decrease the crotyl alcohol selectivity [58]. Another essential factor that promotes the selectivity of the catalyst is the electronic property of the Ir0 species, because it may alter the interaction between the Ir0 and carbonyl carbon through the σ1 bond. The XPS results clearly show that the binding energy of the Ir0 species shifts to lower values with increasing reduction temperature, suggesting an increasing electron density over the Ir0 species with reduction temperature, due to the gradual reduction of cationic Ir species. The high electron density over the Ir0 species is also evidenced by in situ DRIFTS results (Fig. 5), as the band assigning to Ir0 CO has a distinct red shift with increasing reduction temperature, implying a higher electron density over the catalyst reduced at higher temperature. This high electron density over the Ir0 species is believed to be beneficial to the selectivity of crotyl alcohol, since it would enhance the interaction between the charge-enriched Ir0 sites and the charge-deficient carbonyl carbon (the σ1 bond), and meanwhile, weaken the interaction between the Ir0 sites and the charge-enriched CC bond (π). Meanwhile, the roles of Ir particle size on the selectivity should also be concerned. According to the adsorption model of crotonaldehyde presented in Scheme 1, the CC bond (π) and the CO bond (σ1) are more likely to be formed simultaneously on the large Ir particles compared to the small Ir particles, which may lead to a competitive formation of these bonds, consequently enhancing the selectivity to butanal and suppressing the selectivity to the desired crotyl alcohol, as shown in Table 2."
13,Conclusions,"In this work, the effect of reduction temperature on the reactivities and selectivities of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts are studied. Catalyst deactivation is observed in all the catalysts, due to the strong adsorption of crotonaldehyde on the catalyst surface and decarbonylation reaction. However, high selectivity to crotyl alcohol could be obtained by the reduction of the uncalcined IrCl x /TiO2 catalysts. Both activity and selectivity depend on the electronic properties of the Ir species and the surface Lewis acid in the catalyst. The catalyst reduced at low temperature (100°C) contains large content of Ir δ+ (a high Ir δ+/Ir0 ratio) and Cl− species, which results in large amount of strong surface Lewis acid sites and thus suppresses the activity and selectivity. Meanwhile, the catalyst reduced at 300°C (Ir/TiO2-300) has the highest activity and selectivity after 500min reaction. It seems that the enhanced activity and selectivity obtained on the Ir/TiO2-300 catalyst are due to the moderate interaction between the CO bond and the Ir species, and weakened surface Lewis acid sites."
