0,Introduction,"Adherence to good manufacturing practices is a key factor towards ensuring food safety. However, notwithstanding the care and precision employed during production, inappropriate packaging might ruin the finished product rendering it unfit for consumption, and often leads to recall. As a fundamental component of the food production chain, packaging enhances product safety. Packaging basically protects product from the external environment but in recent times, advances in packaging science and technology incorporate various functional roles. The concept of active and intelligent food packaging is an evolving strategy towards promoting safety [1]. These modern packaging materials either enforces food quality through functional roles as antimicrobial/antioxidant components or communicate the quality state of food as indicators or sensors. Microbial proliferation and oxidative degradation of food lead to the production of compounds that alters food quality, resulting in changes in the physicochemical properties including food pH. Detection of pH changes within the food microenvironment indicates possible initiation of the deteriorative process. Thus, the integration of pH based sensors into packaging materials is employed for monitoring the changes in food properties. Several synthetic pH sensing indicator compounds have demonstrated good sensing properties. However, such compounds are required to be nontoxic and biocompatible. Plant phytochemicals such as anthocyanins [2], curcumin [3], alizarin [4], and betalains [5,6] have been evidenced as suitable healthy and economic colorimetric indicator compounds with efficient sensing properties in food packaging. In addition, the use of polymers matrix in the fabrication of packaging composites are considered a safe and environmentally friendly option. Several studies have suggested the use of biodegradable polymers as an edible and inexpensive alternative material for the fabrication of packaging materials. Chitosan is an edible polymer abundantly obtained from nature. It is estimated that about 2000 tons of chitosan is produced annually, mainly extracted from shrimp and crab shell waste [7]. Extraction of chitin and chitosan from seafood waste is a sustainable approach for waste valorization with massive economic benefits. Due to the biodegradability, biocompatibility, and physico-mechanical attributes of chitosan, it is widely used in biomaterial fabrication, pharmaceuticals, food, and cosmetic. Previous studies have demonstrated the suitability of chitosan as a choice polymer for the design of packaging composite/film [8]. However, copolymer coupling of chitosan with the hydrophilic polymer polyvinyl alcohol was reported to improve the physical and mechanical properties of chitosan-based composites [9,10]. In this study, chitosan and poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymers were employed for the fabrication of films using casting method. Natural anthocyanins from Clitoria ternatea flower and Carissa carandas fruit were incorporated as sensing indicators. The films were characterized for physical, mechanical, and topographical properties. In addition, the films were employed as a colorimetric sensor for monitoring the quality of pasteurized milk and fresh orange juice. To ensure the consumers safety, the biocompatibility of anthocyanin released from the indicator films were assessed on erythrocytes and human keratinocyte skin cells."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Flower of C. ternatea (Fabaceae) and fruit of C. carandas (Apocynaceae) were collected from the local market, HatYai, Thailand. Deactelyated (85.28 ± 2.48%) chitosan (CH) (Mw:10.3 × 103 kDa; intrinsic viscosity: 15.44 ± 0.24 dL/g) was extracted from shrimp shells following previous report [11]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (Mw: 9000–10000; viscosity: 2.5–3.5 cP, 4% in water; 99% hydrolyzed), diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Mw 548.68 g/mol) (ABTS), and penicillin-streptomycin (5000 U/mL) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Ethylene tetrazolium bromide (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H, MTT) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Dulbecco's modified eagle medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Gibco (Paisley, UK). Bacteria including Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Lactobacillus casei subspecies Rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917, and Candida albicans ATCC 90028 were obtained from the culture collection (Division of Biological Science, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand). Human skin keratinocytes cells (HaCaT) were obtained from Natural Product Research Center of Excellence, Division of Biological Science, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade."
3,Extraction of anthocyanins,"2.2 Extraction of anthocyanins Anthocyanin-rich extracts were isolated from flower of C. ternatea (CT) and fruit of C. carandas (CC). Flower and fruit were extracted by maceration in 95% ethanol at a ratio of 1:10 w/v under mechanical stirring for 24 h. The soluble extracted solution was concentrated using a rotary evaporator (Buchi-R210, Switzerland)."
4,Colorimetric analysis,"2.3 Colorimetric analysis The sensitivity of the extract indicated by the color change was determined at different pH values. In brief, the extract was mixed with phosphate buffer of pH ranging from 1 to 12. The calorimetric analysis was performed using CIE colorimeter (Hunter associates laboratory, Inc., USA). The color of the extracted anthocyanins in different pH (1−12) was expressed as L*, a*, and b*. The parameters L*, a*, and b* were used to calculate Chroma, Hue angle, ∆E, and browning index. The UV–Vis spectrum of each sample was measured using a multimode spectrophotometer between 300 and 800 nm (Enspire®, PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA). In addition, the infrared spectrum was obtained using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR, Bruker Co., Ettlingen, Germany) at a range of 400–4000 cm−1."
5,Fabrication of intelligent films,"2.4 Fabrication of intelligent films Filmogenic copolymer solution (CHP) was prepared by mixing (2:1) v/v of 0.5% w/v CH solution with 5% w/v PVA solution. A 0.1% v/v glycerol was used as a plasticizer and the films were formed by casting method on a glass frame (11 × 11 cm) dried at room temperature and denoted control as CHP whereas test as CHP–CT and CHP–CC. The copolymer CHP, CHP–CT, and CHP–CC fluid was tested for viscosity using Brookfield viscometer, (LVDV-I Prime, Brookfield, Middleboro, USA)."
6,Characterization of intelligent films,"2.5 Characterization of intelligent films 2.5.1 Structural, surface morphology, and optical property Functional and spectral analysis of intelligent film samples were evaluated using FTIR at a range of 400–4000 cm−1. The surface and cross-sectional morphology of film samples were obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-3400, Hitachi Ltd., Japan), while the surface roughness was analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM-NT-MDT Spectrum instruments, Russia). Three-dimensional images of the films surface (75 um2) were recorded for each test. Data were acquired using Easyscane-2 control software, with mean roughness (Sa), root mean square roughness (Sq), and peak height (Sp). The light transmittance of the film samples was measured using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Briefly, film samples were sized to fit into the cuvette, transmittance were measured at 600 nm. 2.5.2 Porosity, solubility, moisture content, and moisture uptake Film porosity was determined using insoluble solvent following previous report [12]. Briefly, the films were saturated with chloroform, and the weight of film samples was determined before and after immersion. Porosity was calculated using the equation. (1) Porosity = m 2 − m 1 ρV × 100 where m1 and m2 are the weight of the film before and after immersion in the chloroform, respectively. V is the volume of the film before immersion, which was calculated using formula, length x width x height of the film, and ρ is the density of chloroform. Film solubility was determined as the percentage of dissolved dry matter after immersion in water. Briefly, film samples of appropriate size was dried in a hot air oven (ComeTech, Thailand) at 60 °C for 24 h and initial dry weight (Wi) was determined. The film samples were immersed in distilled water of appropriate volume with mild shaking for 24 h. Dissolved samples were dried at 100 °C in a hot air oven for 24 h to determine the final dry weight (Wf). Film solubility was calculated using the equation. (2) Water solubility = W i − W f W i × 100 The moisture content of film samples was analyzed by recording the initial (Wi) and final (Wf) weight after drying at 100 °C for 24 h in a hot air oven. The moisture content was calculated using the equation. (3) Moisture content = W i − W f W i × 100 The moisture uptake of film samples was determined by recording initial (Wi) weight and final weight (Wf) after exposure to saturated humid conditions (50 ± 5% RH) at room temperature for 2 days. The weight gain of the film was recorded (Wf) to calculate moisture uptake using the equation. (4) Moisture uptake = W f − W i W i × 100 2.5.3 Water vapor permeability Water vapor permeability (WVP) was measured according to ASTM E96–95. In brief, film samples were sealed over an aluminum permeation cup containing 20 g of dried silica (0% RH). The cups were placed in the humidity chamber (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, USA) at 25 ± 0.5 °C and 50 ± 5% RH. The cups were weighed at an interval of 24 h over a period of 5 days. Water vapor permeability of film samples was calculated using the equation. (5) WVP gm − 1 D − 1 Pa − 1 = wlA − 1 t − 1 P 2 − P 1 − 1 where, w is the weight gain of the cup (g), l is the film thickness (m), A is the exposed area of the film (m2), t is the time of the gain (Day), and P2 – P1 is the vapor pressure difference across the film (1583.7 Pa at 25 °C). 2.5.4 Surface pH, swelling ratio, and mechanical property The surface pH of film samples was determined using a digital pH meter (Mettler Toledo, Kusnacht, Switzerland). Briefly, film samples were allowed to swell by keeping them in contact with phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 20 min in glass tubes at room temperature. Surface pH was determined using a glass electrode and equilibrated for 1 min. Pre-weighed film samples were immersed in 5 mL of buffer solution for 2 h. The swollen films were taken out and additional water on the surface was wiped using blotting paper and reweighed. The degree of swelling was calculated using the equation. (6) Swelling % = W s − W i W i × 100 where, Ws is the weight of the swollen film after 2 h, Wi is the weight of film over night dried at 60 °C. The thickness of the film samples was measured in 20 replicates with a digital micrometer (0.01 mm) (Mitutoyo, Japan). The tensile strength (TS), Young's modulus (YM), and elongation at break (EB) were measured according to ASTM D412 using the tensile testing machine (Zwick GmbH & Co. KG, Germany). Briefly, five dumbbells-shaped film samples of 115 mm length and 20 mm width were mounted on the film extension assembly at an initial grip distance of 50 mm. A crosshead speed of 50 mm/min was used for recording TS, YM, and EB using (testXpert® II software version 3.31). Folding endurance of the film samples were assessed individually by folding and opening the film repeatedly for 250 times at the same place or until a break developed in the place of folding. 2.5.5 Contact angle and surface energy The contact angle and surface energy of the film samples was evaluated using the sessile drop method. Briefly, samples were placed in a sample holder and 20 μL of probe liquid (double distilled water, formamide, and ethylenediamine) was dropped on the surface of samples and photographed using charged coupled device (CCD) camera (Sanyo, San Diego, USA). Measurements in triplicate were obtained using SCA 20 module software."
7,"Antioxidant potential, total phenolic, and anthocyanin content in films","2.6 Antioxidant potential, total phenolic, and anthocyanin content in films The antioxidant efficacy of the film samples was measured using the DPPH and ABTS+ assays as reported previously [9]. The radical scavenging activity was expressed as ascorbic acid equivalent in mg/g of dry film weight. The total phenolic content of film samples was determined using the Folin-Ciocateu method at an absorbance of 765 nm using a multimode spectrophotometer. The phenolic content was expressed as Gallic acid equivalent in mg/g of dry film weight. Total anthocyanin content (TAC) in test film samples was determined by pH differential method. An aliquot (1 mL) of digested film samples were dissolved in 0.025 M potassium chloride buffer (pH 1.0) and 0.4 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), with a dilution factor. The total anthocyanin content was expressed as cyanidin-3-glycoside equivalent and estimated by measuring the absorbance at 510 nm and 700 nm. (7) TAC = A 510 − A 700 pH 1.0 − A 510 − A 700 pH 4.5 ε × L × Mw × DF × 1000 where A is absorbance, Mw is the molecular weight of cyanidin-3-glycoside (449.2 g/ mol), DF is the dilution factor, ε is the molar extinction coefficient (29,600 L (cm mol−1) –1), and L is the optical length. The anthocyanin content, mg/l was converted to mg/g dry weight of film samples."
8,In vitro anthocyanins release from films,"2.7 In vitro anthocyanins release from films In vitro release test was performed for 24 h to investigate the immobility of anthocyanin from test films. Briefly, 1 g of film samples was immersed in a conical flask containing 50 mL of phosphate buffer pH 6.2 with constant shaking at 50 rpm. An aliquot (1 mL) of the sample was withdrawn and anthocyanin content was quantified as detailed above. The in vitro release data was fitted to the release kinetic model to understand the effect of chitosan-poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymer matrix."
9,Cytocompatibility assay,"2.8 Cytocompatibility assay The cytocompatibility effect of film samples was investigated on human red blood cells. In brief, sterile 100 mg of film samples were immersed in sterile water overnight with constant shaking, and eluents were collected and treated with an equal volume of 3% red blood cells. After incubation (2 h), absorbance was recorded at 600 nm using a multimode spectrophotometer. Further, the cytotoxicity of the film samples was evaluated on HaCaT cells using an indirect method [13,14]. Briefly, sterile intelligent film samples were immersed in DMEM under constant shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h. The cells were treated with eluent (100 μL) after 24 h. Cells without added compound were used as a negative control. Cell viability was analyzed using MTT assay at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Biohit 830, Biohit, Finland)."
10,Colorimetric response to volatile ammonia and bacterial growth,"2.9 Colorimetric response to volatile ammonia and bacterial growth The sensitivity of test film samples to ammonia vapor was analyzed by exposure to 0.8 M of ammonia for 90 min. An appropriate volume of ammonia was transferred to a petri-plate and covered with film samples of 7 cm diameter. The colorimetric response of the test film samples to ammonia vapor was photographed. The colorimetric analysis of test film samples was tested against E. coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 25923, L. casei ATCC 7469, L. plantarum ATCC 14917, and C. albicans ATCC 90028 following previous report [15]. The colorimetric response of film samples was monitored for 24 h."
11,Colorimetric sensitivity of intelligent film to monitor beverage freshness,"2.10 Colorimetric sensitivity of intelligent film to monitor beverage freshness The colorimetric response of film samples to beverage freshness was studied on orange fruit juice and fresh pasteurized cow milk. Briefly, 25 mL of the fruit juice and milk were stored at 25 °C and 4 °C for 72 h. The acidity and pH changes were measured using digital pH meter."
12,Degradation of anthocyanin in film during storage,"2.11 Degradation of anthocyanin in film during storage Photo-degradation of test film samples was measured in different conditions. Briefly, 4 × 4 cm size of film samples was packed in polyamide-polyethylene laminate and stored for 45 days without incident of light at 4 °C, without incident of sunlight at room temperature, and in presence of sunlight. The change in color of the intelligent film compared to zero-day was captured and percentage transmittance was analyzed as previous details."
13,Statistics,"2.12 Statistics Statistical significance of the observed difference between the values in the different groups was determined by one-way ANOVA (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001) (Scheme 1 )."
14,Results and discussion,
15,Characterization of anthocyanins,"3.1 Characterization of anthocyanins Natural anthocyanins display color change with alterations in pH and are reported to exhibit sharp end point as visual indicator for titrimetric analysis [16]. The response of anthocyanin rich extract of CT and CC under different pH (1 to 12) with buffer solution were monitored spectrophotometrically (Fig. S1). The CT extract demonstrated higher bathochromic shift effect, compared to CC extract (Fig. 1 ). The CT extract showed purple red coloration in acidic pH and greenish-yellow color in alkaline pH. However, the CC extract indicated light red and yellow color at acidic and alkaline pH, respectively as reported previously [17]. The color change observed in different pH is attributed to the presence of several anthocyanins including cyanidins-3,5-O-diglycoside, which absorb electromagnetic radiation in the UV–Vis region to indicate a change in color [18]. The UV–Vis spectra of CT and CC extract indicated maximum absorbance at 550–650 nm with λmax of 550, 560, 600, 620 nm and 450–650 nm with λmax of 500 nm and 600 nm, respectively. The shift in the spectra of CT extract from acidic to basic pH with a change in λmax indicated conversion of flavylium cation to carbinol pseudo base [19]. The results demonstrated that the CT and CC extract reflected higher L* values at pH 1 and 12 with a sharp change in total color difference (ΔE) between pH 6–8. The colorimetric sensing ability of the extract was further studied for chroma (C) and hue angle (H) and results demonstrated a similar color variation at acidic and basic pH (Table 1 and 2). The change from pink to light blue for CT and red to dark brown color for CC with the increase in pH indicated transformation of red flavylium cations of anthocyanin due to accumulation of carbinol pseudo base and chalcone [20]. Moreover, in alkaline pH (8–10) colorimetric response of anthocyanin rich extract showed bluish-green and light brown coloration for CT and CC, respectively. The development of yellow color for CT and CC extract at pH 12 is attributed to the formation of yellow chalcone and the opening of the anthocyanin ring [21]. The colorimetric study indicated that CT extract was effective at the tested pH range (pH 2–8), however the CC extract was more effective at pH 2 and 8. The response to the pH changes confirmed that CT and CC extract could be effectively incorporated as a sensing agent for real-time detection of beverage freshness."
16,Characterization of intelligent films,"3.2 Characterization of intelligent films 3.2.1 Structural, surface morphology, and optical property The viscosity results for film forming solution showed that the control copolymer solution was more viscous compared to extract incorporated filmogenic solution. This was probably due to the higher polymeric content with low water content of the control film. The color of CHP–CT and CHP–CC films significantly differed from the CHP film (p < 0.05), with light green and brownish yellow coloration, whereas CHP was transparent. The FTIR spectra of extract and extract fortified intelligent films indicated distinguish bands at higher frequency range Fig. 2 . The spectra demonstrated intermolecular bonded ~OH vibrational stretching at 3301 and 3350 cm−1 for CT and CC, respectively. The CT extract exhibited N=N=N stretching, disubstituted CC stretching, and CC bending at 2134, 1637, and 949 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, FTIR spectra of CC extract displayed α-β-unsaturated ester CO stretching, vinylidene CC stretching, methyl group ~CH bending, ~CN stretching, and ~ CO stretching vibration at 1718, 1648, 1450, 1274, and 1085 cm−1, respectively. In addition, CC extract demonstrated CO–O–CO stretching and CC bending at 1044 and 946–879 cm−1. The results from a previous study indicated that peaks between 1100 and 1000 cm−1 indicate the presence of anthocyanin (cyaniding-3-O-sambubioside and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside) in CT and CC extract [22]. The FTIR spectra of film samples evidenced molecular interaction with major bands of CH and PVA. The FTIR spectra of CHP film exhibited ~OH stretching vibration (at 3284–2930 cm−1), ~OH bending (1372–1328 cm−1), ~CO stretching (at 1250–1034 cm−1), and CC bending (at 946 cm−1). The CO stretching of acetate group in PVA was observed at 1655 cm−1 and additional, ~CH bending around 1420 cm−1 indicating ~CH2 group in the polymeric chain was observed within CHP–CT and CHP–CC films [9]. Moreover, CT and CC band around 3300 cm−1 shifted to 3200 cm−1 might be due to interaction between the hydroxyl group of copolymer and anthocyanin [23]. In addition, the reduction in the intensity of anthocyanin around 1650 cm−1 incorporated in copolymer matrix observed due to interaction of anthocyanin aromatic ring (C=C) and aglycon-pyranoside (C=O) with amide of CH (~NH stretching vibration) [24]. Furthermore, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding could be the principal mode of interaction between copolymer matrix with anthocyanin that cannot be observed using FTIR [25]. The surface and cross-sectional images of film samples are presented in Fig. 3 . The results showed that the CHP films were smooth, whereas the cross-sectional image showed a compact structure for CHP–CT and CHP–CC films. The test films indicated dispersed fine particles with wrinkles due to the interaction of extract with the co-polymeric network [26] and processing step [15]. AFM topographic results demonstrated lower surface mean roughness for CHP film (Sa: 4.94 ± 0.86 nm), compared to CHP–CT (Sa: 21.16 ± 0.44 nm) and CHP–CC (Sa: 25.25 ± 0.26 nm). The surface roughness was further confirmed by the root mean square roughness (Sq) and peak height (Sp) values of 8.69 ± 0.44 nm, 27.84 ± 0.28 nm, 47.49 ± 0.79 nm and 257.7 ± 5.2 nm, 171.5 ± 2.88 nm, 419.45 ± 7.81 nm, respectively. The results suggested that the phenolic hydroxyl group of C. ternatea and C. carandas extract was strongly bonded within the copolymer matrix, which probably improve the physicochemical and mechanical properties of the film [27]. The optical property of intelligent film is an important parameter that affects the consumer acceptance and also response to the extent of oxidative food spoilage. The results of optical property indicated that CHP film exhibited high transmittance compared to test films, which might be due to the colorless and transparent nature of the control film. Moreover, the film incorporated with CT demonstrated a superior UV light barrier property, compared to CC at a wavelength of 300–700 nm. Anthocyanin incorporated copolymer films have been previously reported to exhibit excellent optical barrier property against UV–Vis light [23]."
17,Water vapor permeability,"3.3 Water vapor permeability Water vapor permeability is an important physical property of packaging material against the permeability of vapors. Low vapor permeability indicates the ability of packaging materials to effectively protect the food products from deterioration due to the accumulation of moisture. The results demonstrated a significant difference in the WVP between the control and the test films (p > 0.05). Moreover, the CHP–CT presented lower permeability, compared with CHP–CC films. The increase in WVP of test film, compared to control might be due to alteration of the polymeric network, resulting from the dispersion of concentrated extract in filmogenic solution [28]. Moreover, the incorporation of extract might have altered the original molecular interaction of the copolymer matrix, interfering with the structure of the test films. Although, the test films demonstrated increased WVP, compared with control the WVP of test films was comparatively low indicating the appropriateness of films as food packaging material [29]."
18,"Porosity, solubility, moisture content, and uptake","3.4 Porosity, solubility, moisture content, and uptake Film porosity and integrity influence the migration of active component with an effect on the mechanical strength of packaging film. The test and control film showed a porosity of 0.12–0.34%. The results indicated that the test films were more porous, compared with the control film. High porosity is reported to affects the elongation at break, water absorption, and WVP [30] (Tables 1 and 2 ). The solubility results for test and control film are presented in Table 3 . CHP–CT and CHP–CC films demonstrated a reduction in water solubility, compared to control films after 24 h. This might be due to the hydrophobic nature of anthocyanins [21]. Similarly moisture content and uptake of test and control film were ~12.0% and ~9.0%, respectively. A slight increase was obvious after the addition of extract, resulting from intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between anthocyanin and hydroxyl/amino group of copolymer matrix along with water molecules [31]."
19,"Surface pH, swelling ratio, and mechanical property","3.5 Surface pH, swelling ratio, and mechanical property Surface pH affects the permeation of incorporated active constituents from the film. The surface pH results for test and control films ranged from 6.15–7.0. Swelling is an important indicator property for the calorimetric sensing film as it could affect the color response efficiency during long-term storage. A highly swellable intelligent film will release the incorporated anthocyanin which reduces the sensing efficacy. The result of swelling index is expressed as the water uptake percentage of the film until saturation state. The results demonstrated reduction in swelling index with the addition of CT and CC extract in the copolymer matrix (Table 3). The interaction of extract might have reduced the binding potential for water absorption. Swelling index is proportional to solubility as the swelling behavior is closely related to the total water molecules in the copolymer film microstructure network [32]. The thickness analysis demonstrated that the test films were not significantly affected by the addition of extract (p > 0.05). The mechanical properties of the test and control films are presented in Table 3. The addition of extract to the copolymer matrix significantly reduced the TS and YM from 42.92–14.73 mPa and 0.05–0.03 mPa for test films, respectively (p < 0.05). However, the EB increased from 92.25 to 227.41 (%) for test films, compared to control films. These results might be due to specific interaction of extract with copolymer matrix leading to plasticization, altering hydrogen bonding, which subsequently promoted the movement of molecules and breaking of the dense spatial structure of test films [33]."
20,Contact angle and surface energy,"3.6 Contact angle and surface energy Contact angle and surface energy results of test and control films are presented in Fig. 3. The results demonstrated that both test and control films were hydrophilic with contact angle and surface energy of 52.75 ± 1.16, 52.11 ± 1.21, 79.98 ± 1.68 and 46.06 ± 0.35, 46.00 ± 0.92, 28.67 ± 0.26 (mN/m) for CHP, CHP–CT, and CHP–CC, respectively. The incorporation of CC flower extract increased the contact angle values of the test film. The increment in contact angle for CHP–CC might be due to the hydrophobic nature of extracted anthocyanin [34]."
21,"Antioxidant potential, total phenolic and anthocyanin content in film","3.7 Antioxidant potential, total phenolic and anthocyanin content in film Oxidative stress promotes various degenerative reactions with the development of rancidity and off-flavors, affecting the nutritional value and customer acceptance of foodstuff. The radical scavenging efficacy (DPPH and ABTS+) of CHP–CT and CHP–CC films were significantly higher, compared to control films (p < 0.05). The presence of several bioactive compounds including flavonoid within extract enhanced the antioxidant properties of the test films [35] (Fig. 4 ). Anthocyanins are polyphenols with phenolic hydroxyl groups that eliminate free radicals by forming phenoxy groups [36]. The antioxidant properties of control film reflect the radical scavenging ability of CH [9]. Phenolic compounds are hydrophilic in nature bearing aromatic ring of one or more hydroxyl substituent that potentiates antioxidant activity. The results of total phenolic and anthocyanin are presented in Table 3. The results demonstrated that phenolic and total anthocyanins content of CHP–CC films were significantly higher than CHP–CT films(p < 0.05). The major phenolic and anthocyanin compounds reported in C. ternatea flower including myricetin-3-(2-rhamnosylrutinoside), ternatin, epigallocatechin, quercetin, kaempferol-3(2-rhamnosylrutinoside), and kaempferol-3-neohesperidoside [36]. In contrast, ferulic acid, rutin, and cyanidin-3-glucoside were reported in C. carandas fruits [37]. Food quality is significantly affected by free radicals, an oxidative chain reaction which is a basic mechanism of lipid peroxidation. The addition of phenolic-rich antioxidant agents inhibits the generation of free radical molecules, thus inhibiting per-oxidation of food products, thereby maintains food quality and extending shelf life."
22,In vitro anthocyanins release from films,"3.8 In vitro anthocyanins release from films Total anthocyanin content obtained by digesting 1 g of films was considered as 100% and used to calculate the in-vitro release. Results demonstrated that the films were stable with 0.98 and 2.03% of anthocyanin release after 24 h from CHP–CT and CHP–CC films. Furthermore, the coefficient of correlation fitted data showed that the release kinetic was best fitted to first-order kinetics suggesting that release was concentration-dependent. In addition, Peppa's model suggested classic Fickian diffusion. A similar dye leaching study demonstrated the release of a negligible percentage of incorporated anthocyanin [38]. This result suggested that the copolymer films exhibited excellent resistance to anthocyanin release."
23,Cytocompatibility assay,"3.9 Cytocompatibility assay To ensure the safety of consumers, the toxicity of the films was evaluated against human keratinocytes skin cells and erythrocytes. Although, a previous study reported the toxicity of anthocynidine [39], hemolytic effect of CHP, CHP-CT, and CHP-CC copolymer films on human blood erythrocytes showed 0.98, 1.48, and 2.07% of hemolysis, respectively (Fig. S2). The cytotoxicity assay showed that both test and control films were biocompatible with >80% of cell viability on HaCat cells (Fig. 5 ), and were not significantly different from the control films (p > 0.05). The biocompatibility observed is in congruence with results of immobilization assay which demonstrated low release of anthocyanin. In addition, a previous study demonstrated that leaching of active ingredients from chitosan-poly(vinyl alcohol) films resulted in mild cytotoxicity on human cell lines [9]. The hemolytic effects on blood cells also indicated that the films were biocompatible to human red blood erythrocytes."
24,Colorimetric response to volatile ammonia and bacterial growth,"3.10 Colorimetric response to volatile ammonia and bacterial growth The sensitivity of the intelligent films to 0.8 M ammonia vapors was measured to determine the response behavior of the indicator films to volatile nitrogen compound generated during food spoilage process. Colorimetric change in film were observed from the interaction between NH3 and H2O molecules present within the copolymer chains and formation of OH− which might affect anthocyanin structure and promote color change (Fig. S3). The colorimetric response of film covered over the petri-plate was monitored to investigate the effect of amines produced during bacterial growth (Fig. S4). Both CHP–CT and CHP–CC films demonstrated color change against E. coli and S. aureus probably due to the formation and release of carbonic acid [15]. The response of test film against C. albicans demonstrated yellowish-green and brownish yellow coloration for CHP–CT and CHP–CC films, respectively, due to the release of volatile nitrogen [15]. However, the colorimetric response of test films against L. casei and L. plantarum was not significant (p > 0.05). The results demonstrated that the test films could be used as visual pH sensor tool for cost-effective food packaging films."
25,Colorimetric sensitivity of intelligent film to monitor beverage freshness,"3.11 Colorimetric sensitivity of intelligent film to monitor beverage freshness The colorimetric response of the test films for beverage freshness is presented in Fig. 6 . The pH was measured to determine the acidity of the pasteurized milk and fruit juice. The pH of the milk and juice were 6.2 and 4.3, respectively at 0 h. However, the pH significantly changed to 4.1 and 3.4 for milk and fruit juice, respectively at room temperature after 72 h (p < 0.05). The acidity and pH are proportional, thus indicating significant degradation of milk < pH 6.5 with reference to acidity. A previous study demonstrated similar results for milk spoilage [40]. Moreover, the beverage stored at 4 °C showed no significant change in pH (p > 0.05). In addition, significant change in color was observed for CHP–CC at the acidic pH of spoiled beverage whereas a sharp change in color at neutral to alkaline pH range was observed (p > 0.05). However, CHP–CT films showed excellent color change and could be potentially applied as an indicator for monitoring the freshness of pasteurized milk and fruit juice. The stability and swiftness of colorimetric sensing of the film depend on the concentration of incorporated anthocyanin. Furthermore, the weak and poor pH sensing phenomena of copolymer matrix film relate to the action of a sol-gel solution on anthocyanin as well as the low content of incorporated anthocyanin. Hence a higher stable anthocyanin fortified in the matrix would be more favorable [41]."
26,Degradation of anthocyanin in film during storage,"3.12 Degradation of anthocyanin in film during storage Photo-degradation test was carried out to understand the stability of anthocyanin within the film in different condition including absence of light at 4 °C, room temperature, and presence of sunlight. The results of percentage transmissions indicated no significant change in values for tested films at 4 °C and room temperature without incident of light (p > 0.05) (Fig. S5). However, a significant change in percentage transmission for CHP–CT films was observed, compared to CHP–CC films (p < 0.05). The photo-degradation of anthocyanin in presence of rays from sunlight is suggested to be responsible for the observed results [23]. An anthocyanin is a structurally flavylium nucleus bonded to sugar, organic acids, and hydroxyl groups which are easily affected by temperature, pH, solvents, exposure to UV radiations, and pigment structure [42]."
27,Conclusion,"In this study, anthocyanin extracted from the flower of C. ternatea and fruit of C. carandas were incorporated in biodegradable chitosan-poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymer film as an intelligent colorimetric pH indicators. The extracts did not affect the physical and mechanical properties of the films. The C. ternatea incorporated films were more pH-sensitive compared to C. carandas extract incorporated films. The C. ternatea flower extract incorporated films showed good qualities for sensing beverage spoilage, thus could be further developed into packaging as a quality and freshness indicator for beverages."
