0,Introduction,"Water electrolysis has been recognized as one of the most promising approaches to produce clean H2 fuel for sustainable energy and environment [1,2]. Generally, water electrolysis process consists of two electrochemical reactions: Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode [3–5]. However, the strict couple of HER with OER might expose a danger of explosion due to the mixing of H2/O2 [6,7]. Moreover, the crossed O2 through membrane would be reduced back on the cathode side, resulting in low energy conversion efficiency and short lifetime of water splitting cell [6–9]. Especially, large-scale water splitting is hampered by its slow kinetics of OER because the four-electron transfer process of OER requires much higher energy consumption [10–13]. Although many excellent electrocatalysts have been reported, the water electrolysis cell still requires a potential of 1.5–2.0 V to operate [14–17], which is substantially larger than the standard theoretical thermodynamic potential (1.23 V). In addition, the produced O2 is of low value. Hence, it is urgent to address the safety concern and reduce the energy consumption of H2 generation in the overall reaction. Recently, an efficient strategy has been developed to replace OER by thermodynamic favorable anodic oxidation reaction in water since it can be integrated with HER to generate H2 with less electrical energy consumption [6–8,13]. To realize the co-electrolysis, some reduced agents and organics substrate molecules have been used to optimizing the aqueous electrolyte, such as: urea [18,19], hydrazine [20,21], ammonia [22–24], alcohols [25–31], furfural [7,13,32,33], biomass-derived intermediate compounds [34,35], etc. Comparing to the traditional water electrolysis with HER and OER, these co-electrolysis reactions could significantly decrease operating voltage to produce hydrogen. Furthermore, some value-added compounds could be obtained simultaneously by the selective anodic oxidation of certain substrate molecules in the co-electrolysis. In order to maximize the utilization of energy investment, the substrate molecules that are cheap, abundant and can be cost-efficiently oxidized to value-added outcome is highly required for the anodic oxidation reaction [5,25,33]. Methanol is simple and low-cost industrial raw material. This basic saturated monohydric alcohol has a huge production capacity, and is easily transported and stored [5,25,36]. Besides, it can be oxidized into several important chemicals including formic acid, which can be used as a rubber auxiliary agent, preservative and disinfectant in various chemical industries [36–39]. Conventional industrial processes (e.g., steam reforming) of methanol oxidation and H2 production usually require high temperature and pressure, which may result in a mixture of H2 and carbon-based gaseous products like CO, CO2, and the additional purification processes are required to obtain high quality H2 [37,39]. In contrast, electro-oxidation of methanol under ambient condition with simultaneous H2 production represents an alternative green approach. Many electrocatalysts have been explored to realize the efficient methanol electro-oxidation reaction (MOR). The noble-metal materials exhibit outstanding catalytic activity, but suffer from high-cost and poor-durability, and the resulted fully oxidative product CO2 is detrimental to the environment [38,40,41]. Therefore, developing economically attractive, highly selective and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts to integrate value-added chemicals from methanol selective oxidation with HER is of great significance, but still challengeable. The earth-abundant transition metals and their compounds have been reported as promising electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion and storage [3,8,42–44]. Non-noble metal-based hydroxide, as one of the most typical electrocatalysts, possesses various electronic states and has shown outstanding performance in different electrocatalytic applications [12,14,18,22,27,31,45]. However, metal hydroxides generally suffer from low conductivity and poor stability, so that merging them with conductive support (e.g., Ni foam, NF) is a feasible approach to promote the charge transfer [13,14,16,20,21,24,25,29–31]. In addition, many researchers have elaborated that the group VIII metal sulfide [5,16,46–48], selenide [24,29,49], and phosphide [4,8,13,20,21,23] nanomaterials act as the active and durable electrocatalysts beyond oxides and hydroxides of the same. Among these, transition-metal phosphides have received rising attention due to its unique chemical and physical properties [13,20]. It has been proved that the phosphorus doping into cobalt crystal lattices play a crucial role in electrocatalysis [8,50,51]. Herein, we report unique NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) ultrathin nanosheets coated cobalt phosphide nanosheets arrays on Ni foam (Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF) as efficient bifunctional heterostructured electrocatalysts for the methanol/water co-electrolysis system to co-generate hydrogen and value-added formate. Benefiting from the fast charge transfer and abundant active sites in the hetero-interface, Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF hierarchical heteronanosheets exhibit a robust co-electrolytic performance with potential of 1.24 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) for methanol selective oxidation and −0.10 V (vs. RHE) for HER at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, the integrated two-electrode electrolyzer drives 10 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of only 1.43 V. Impressively, the Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF electrocatalysts show high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100% for H2 and fromate production at different current densities with excellent durability."
1,Experimental,
2,Material preparation,"2.1 Material preparation Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (nickelous nitrate, 99.99%, AR grade), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (cobaltous nitrate, 99.99%, AR grade) and NaH2PO2 (sodium hypophosphite, 99.99%, AR grade) were purchased from Aladdin Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were of analytical grade and deionized water (DIW) was used throughout the experiment. Before the synthesis, the Ni foam (NF) substrate (2.0 × 1.0 cm2) was degreased in aceton, ethanol and DIW for 10 min with sonication, respectively. Then it was cleaned by 3.0 M HCl for 10 min to remove the oxide layer on the surface. 2.1.1 Electrodeposition of Co(OH)2/NF The electrodeposition was performed in a three-electrode cell consisting of the pretreated Ni foam as working electrode, a Pt sheet (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm) as counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode at room temperature. The Co(OH)2 was deposited on Ni foam in a 0.05 M Co(NO3)2 ·6H2O aqueous electrolyte. During 300 s deposition under the −1.0 V (vs. SCE), the reduction of NO3 − to NH4 + at cathod brought about accompanying occurrence of OH− in Eq. (1), resulting in the formation of α-Co(OH)2 with neighboring Co2+ in Eq. (2), which was strongly adhered on the surface of NF. Then the green Ni foam was carefully rinsed with DIW and finally dried in air. (1) NO3 − + 8e− + 7H2O → NH4 + + 10OH− (2) Co2+ + 2OH− → Co(OH)2 2.1.2 Preparation of CoxP/Nf For a typical phosphorization, the Co(OH)2/NF (2.0 cm × 1.0 cm) was placed in a porcelain boat and the other one containing 0.50 g NaH2PO2 was put at the upstream of tube furnace as the phosphorus source. These two alumina boats were calcined at 300 °C for 2 h with a heating speed of 2 °C min−1 under Ar flow and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The NaH2PO2 was decomposed at around 300 °C which produced PH3 for phosphorization of the Co2+ hydroxide on NF in Eqs. (3) and (4). Finally, the surface of Ni foam was covered by the black Co x P. (3) 4NaH2PO2 → Na4P2O7 + H2O + 2PH3↑ (4) 2xCo + 2PH3 → 2Co x P + 3H2↑ 2.1.3 Electrodeposition of CoxP@NiCo-LDH/NF As previously described, Ni(NO3)2 ·6H2O (0.0333 M) and Co(NO3)2 ·6H2O (0.0167 M) were dissolved in DIW. The mixture was under constant magnetic stirring, and then subjected to an intense ultrasonic treatment for a few minutes in order to form a clear solution. After 50 s electrodeposition, the black sample was rinsed with DIW and naturally dried in air."
3,Material characterizations,"2.2 Material characterizations The surface morphology was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Sukhoi SU-70). High resolution lattice transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images and elemental mapping were taken with the JEM-F200. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected by the SmartLab/max 4500 V (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo) with Cu-K α = 1.45 Å radiation source in the scanning range from 2theta = 10° to 80°. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, MDTC-EQ-M20-01, PHI 5000, VersaProbe II) was used to analyze the surface compositions and oxidation states of elements."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements For the electrochemical measurements, CHI760E electrochemical analyzer (ChenHua Instruments, Inc., Shanghai) and Solartron SI1287 potentiostat were employed. All electrochemical experiments were performed under the continuous stirred condition using 1.0 M KOH presence or absent 0.5 M methanol as the electrolyte. Measurements were carried out in a standard three-electrode configuration with prepared samples (Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF etc., 1.0 cm × 0.5 cm) as the working electrode, the counter electrode of platinum sheet (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm) and Hg/HgO (1.0 M KOH, aqueous) as the reference electrode. The potential drop (iR) losses due to the solution/system resistance were applied to all initial data according to the Eq. (5): (5) E corr = E mea−iR All potentials were reported with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) following the Eq. (6): (6) E RHE = E Hg / HgO + 0.0591 × p H + 0.0977 V . Polarization curves were measured using the linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) methods with the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The durability tests were performed at a constant potential for 20 h in 1.0 M KOH/0.5 M methanol. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were taken at AC amplitude of 0.005 V in frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) was obtained by measuring the capacitive current associated with double-layer charging from the scan-rate dependence of cyclic voltammetric stripping. The potential window without Faraday efficiency of cyclic voltammetric was 0.853 V to 0.953 V vs. RHE at five different scan rates of 10 to 50 mV s−1 with an interval of 10 mV s−1. For this, The C dl was estimated by plotting the Δj = (j a − j c) at 0.903 V (where j c and j a are the cathodic and anodic current densities, respectively) vs. RHE against the scan rate, in which the slope was twice that of C dl. The production of formate ion from electrochemical selective methanol oxidation is characterized by the ion chromatography (IC, Shenghan, CIC-D120), which is equipped with organic anion columns containing the leacheate (carrier liquid: 2.4 mM Na2CO3 and 6.0 mM NaHCO3). After chronoamperometry measurements, the product of MOR was analyzed quantitatively and calculated the corresponding Faradaic efficiency. The 10 mL electrolyte was collected 100 µL and diluted in 9.9 mL DIW with a dilution rate of 1:100. The measurement of each sample was repeated three times and the generated formate ion was calibrated by standard curve that based on known-concentrations samples. And the amount of H2 from HER is on-line characterized by the gas chromatography (GC, Fuli 9790 Plus) that equipped with TCD and FID detector. The carrier gas is high purity argon (Ar, 99.999%) with the 20 mL min−1 flow rate. And the produced H2 was quantified according to the pre-prepared standard curve under the same conditions. The Faradaic efficiency was calculated using the Eq. (7): (7) Faradaic efficiency ( % ) = mol of product formed × nF total charge passed × 100 % , where F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol−1) and n is the electron transfer number, which is 4.0 of MOR and 2.0 of HER, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,"The Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF hierarchical heteronanosheets electrocatalysts are prepared via the following steps as described in experimental section and Scheme 1 . In the first step, Co(OH)2 nanosheets arrays are electrodeposited on Ni foam. It could be seen that the color changes from metallic nickel to dark green after Co(OH)2 deposition on Ni foam (Fig. S1a, b), suggesting the formation of α-Co(OH)2. The subsequent phosphorization process leads to the formation of black Co x P nanosheet arrays on the Ni foam (Fig. S1c). Finally, the NiCo layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) ultrathin nanosheets are grown on the surface of Co x P nanosheets also by electrodeposition. The color of electrode remains unchanged during this step (Fig. S1d), which might be due to the low amount and ultrathin feature of NiCo-LDH layer. The SEM images (Figs. 1 a, b and S2a, b) indicate that continuous macroscopic porous structure of Ni foam is fully covered by interconnected Co(OH)2 smooth nanosheets with lateral size of 0.5–1.0 µm and thickness of about 3.0–5.0 nm. Decoration of NF surface with high-surface area Co(OH)2 nanosheets can provide more suitable sites for the subsequent growth of active species and the nanosheet arrays form many pores for efficient mass transport in the electrolysis reaction. In order to improve the electrochemical activity and conductivity for potential electrochemical applications, phosphorus is introduced into this electrocatalysts [8,13,20]. The cobalt phosphide still maintain the nanosheet arrays feature (Fig. 1(c)) and are well-integrated with some very fine nanoparticles on the nanosheets’ surface (Fig. 1(d)). According to the previous researches, nickel-based electrocatalysts exhibits excellent performance in such organic oxidation reactions, which can be attributed to the electrochemically-generated active oxyhydroxide species [13,25–31]. Moreover, the introduction of Co cations with a smaller atomic radius in Ni(OH)2 can also enhance catalytic activity [8,31,32]. Therefore, NiCo bimetallic hydroxides with various compositions are prepared as potential active species. It can be observed in SEM images (Fig. S2b–h) that the nanosheets domains become smaller with the increase of Ni/Co ratio. The electrocatalytic performances of different samples towards methanol oxidation are also evaluated and shown in Fig. S3(a–i). Among them, the components with Ni/Co ratio of 2:1 present the outstanding electrocatalytic activity whereas Ni(OH)2/NF and Co(OH)2/NF exhibit far lower catalytic activities than the NiCo bimetallic hydroxides, suggesting that the introduction of Co might change the electronic structure of Ni and potentially improve the electrochemical performance for Ni-based oxyhydroxides. It is clear that the synergistic effect between Ni and Co plays a key role in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. Thus, the NiCo hydroxide with Ni/Co ratio of 2:1 is applied to be electrodeposited on the surface of Co x P/NF to fabricate Co x P@NiCo-LDH electrocatalysts. The low magnification SEM image (Fig. 1(e)) show that the Co x P@NiCo-LDH displays similar nanosheet arrays architecture as the as-prepared Co(OH)2 and Co x P. With higher magnification SEM image (Fig. 1(f)), it can be observed that uniform ultrathin nanosheets are grown on the surface of Co x P nanoarrays to form heterostructure. Such unique highly open network and hierarchical hetero-architecture might expose rich edge sites, thus facilitating the mass transfer and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. TEM image in Fig. 2 (a), a close-up view taken from the resulting CoxP@NiCo-LDH heteronanosheets shows that the well-crystallined phosphide nanoparticles with diameters of 4–6 nm are uniformly distributed throughout the whole nanosheets and surrounded by amorphous domains. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2(b)) indicates well-resolved lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.243 and 0.218 nm, indexed to the (102) and (121) crystal plane of CoP and Co2P, respectively. The lattice fringes in Fig. 2(c) are assigned to the (015) plane of NiCo-LDH. All the results agree well with the interplanar distance values in the previous reports [52,53]. The amorphous phase in Fig. 2(a–c) might be associated with the appearance of phosphates or NiCo hydroxide active species, which wrap on the phosphide to prevent the possible aggregation [54,55]. The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra shown in Fig. 2(d) also suggest the existence and homogeneous distribution of Co, Ni and P. To characterize the crystal structure of as-synthesized samples, Fig. 3 (a) presents the corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. As shown, the diffraction peaks of Co(OH)2 nanosheets are quite weak due to being suppressed by the strong diffraction peaks of Ni foam substrate and the poor crystallinity of α-Co(OH)2 obtained by electrodeposition. The well-defined reflections of CoP and Co2P phase are displayed after the phosphorization treatment, implying the α-Co(OH)2 precursor is successfully converted into Co-P phases. The diffraction peaks at 40.7°, 48.1° and 53.7° can be assigned to the (121), (112) and (103) crystal planes of Co2P (JCPDS No. 32-0306) and CoP (JCPDS No. 29-0497), respectively [23,52,53]. After the final electrodeposition step, the slight diffraction peaks of NiCo bimetallic hydroxide phases could also be observed. The above XRD results of Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF are in well agreement with HRTEM analysis. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is employed to characterize the chemical states of elements in Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF. The survey spectrum (Fig. 3(b)) confirms the existence of Co, Ni, P and O, in which the peak of P is weak since the surface of Co x P is covered by the NiCo hydroxide layer. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the high-resolution spectrum shows distinct peaks at 782.2 and 798.1 eV can be assigned to Co (2p) in NiCo hydroxide. The binding energy is slightly higher than that of metallic Co, indicating that the Co carries a partially positive charge (Co δ +) [30,31,33]. The peaks at binding energy (BE) of 776.6 and 797.5 eV can be attributed to the Co species associated with Co−P and Co−PO x in amorphous phase as shown in Fig. 2(a–c) [23,52,53]. The typical peaks in Ni 2p with two obvious satellites (Fig. 3(d)) can be assigned to the Ni2+ in NiCo hydroxide [22,27,31]. The peaks at 129.5 and 132.4 eV in Fig. 3(e) are assigned to P 2p 3/2 and P 2p 1/2 corresponding to reductive phosphorus in forms of Co x P. The binding energy of 129.5 eV is slightly lower than that of element P, which suggests the P is partially negatively charged (P δ −) in Co x P. The peak at 134.2 eV can be attributed to oxidized P species [4,13,23]. To further reveal the amorphous phase in Fig. 2(a–c), the deconvoluted O 1s spectra for the Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF sample is shown in Fig. 3(f), which suggests the presence of the hydroxide groups (OH−) and the P−O bonding, agrees well with the Co2+, Ni2+, Co−PO x and P−O binding energy observed in Fig. 3(c–e) [23,31,53]. To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance, CoxP@NiCo-LDH/NF is directly employed as a free-standing electrode in the typical three-electrode configuration. The Co(OH)2/NF, Co x P/NF, Co(OH)2@NiCo-LDH /NF and bare NF are also examined for comparison. Since OER is the competitive reaction of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the selection of robust electrocatalysts with high methanol oxidation activity is critical to achieve less energy consumption and high selectivity of the overall reaction system [25,27,31]. The electrocatalytic activities towards OER and MOR are examined in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with or without the presence of 0.5 M methanol. Fig. 4 (a) shows the comparison of polarization curves for as-fabricated electrodes. An oxidation peak appears before 1.30 V (vs. RHE) in the absence of methanol, indicating that the metal cations are oxidized to higher valence state [8,9]. However, a potential of higher than 1.50 V (vs. RHE) is required to drive the sluggish OER, which agrees well with previously reported results [9,14,15]. By comparing the OER performance, it can be found that Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF electrode presents higher current density than its counterparts, suggesting that the outstanding electrochemical activity of Co x P@NiCo-LDH. The electrocatalytic activity towards MOR is then investigated in the presence of 0.5 M methanol. Fig. 4(a) displays that the oxidation peak of transition metals disappears before the sharp increase of current density, which suggests that the electrochemically generated high valence state NiCo-OOH might be the active species towards MOR. This mechanism is in good agreement with previous studies of transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the electro-oxidation of small organic molecules such as urea [18,19], primary amines [22–24] and 5-hydroxymethylfufural [32,33], etc., in which M2+ (M = Fe, Co, Ni) is first oxidized to M3+ (M-OOH) species in Eq. (8) and then act as chemical oxidants towards the oxidation of functional groups in organic molecules [12,13,26,29,31,56]. Impressively, the potential of MOR is negatively shifted by 200 mV comparing with that of OER to achieve the same current density (50 mA cm−2), revealing an excellent capability of catalyzing MOR than OER. In order to elucidate the positive effect of the phosphorization in composite electrode, pristine Ni foam and Co(OH)2@NiCo-LDH/NF are also tested for comparison. As shown in Fig. S4, the oxidation peak of Co(OH)2@NiCo-LDH/NF appears earlier than that of the bare Ni foam. However, its current density increases slowly due to the poor activity/conductivity of Co(OH)2. In contrast, the Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF electrode exhibits the lowest onset potential and highest current density towards MOR. Specifically, it delivers current densities of 10, 20, 50 and 100 mA cm−2 at the potentials of 1.24, 1.28, 1.32 and 1.34 V vs. RHE, respectively. Such outstanding performance is superior to its counterparts (Figs. 4a and S4) and the previous reported electrocatalysts (Table S1). In addition, the electrocatalytic kinetics of the obtained electrocatalysts is assessed by Tafel plots. As shown in Fig. 4(b), all the corresponding Tafel slopes of electrocatalysts towards MOR are significantly lower than those of OER, illustrating the greatly enhanced reaction kinetics of anodic methanol oxidation. The Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF electrode shows a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec−1, remarkably lower than that of Co x P/NF (73 mV dec−1) and Co(OH)2/NF (111 mV dec−1). The results demonstrate the superior catalytic kinetics of Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF towards MOR. Furthermore, the multi-current steps (Fig. 4(c)) show that the addition of methanol decreases the applied potential by about 200 mV at different current densities (20–400 mA cm−2), evidencing the lower energy consumption of MOR over OER. Heterogeneous electrocatalytic process generally involves the absorption of reactants or intermediates on the surface along with charge transfer, and the subsequent desorption of products. The efficiency of charge transfer depends on the surface charge density of electrocatalysts, which governs the activity and selectivity [12,14,43,45,50]. Therefore, motivated by the selective electro-oxidation of other alcohols [25–31], continuous electrolysis is performed at a constant potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE in order to trace the anodic products. As shown in Fig. 4(d), both Co(OH)2/NF and Co x P/NF show an obvious decay of current density during the test. In comparison, the Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF electrode demonstrates an outstanding durability as the current density remains stable during 20 h of electrolysis. SEM images as shown in Fig. S5 display that the 3D hierarchical nanostructure is well maintained after catalyzing long-term MOR. The relatively thin layer (Fig. S5f) in situ form on the surface of nanosheets might be originated from the accommodation of weakly bound alkali-metal cations and water (hydrate form) in the nanostructure, which act as the active oxyhydroxide species in the anodic oxidation reactions [18,23]. Then the electrochemically generated high valence state NiCo-OOH might contributes to strengthen heterojunction interface interactions and keep the nanostructure from collapse. The yield of production during the continuous electrolysis is determined by ion chromatography (IC) every 30 min and the clear peak assigned to formate (Fig. 4(e)) is observed. The calculated Faradaic efficiency (Fig. 4(e), inset) is close to 100% during the period of test. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Faradaic efficiency (Fig. 4(f)) is close to unity under different current densities from 40 mA cm−2 to 200 mA cm−2. Fig. S6 displays the IC signal of formate and Faradaic efficiency for each current density, and the corresponding data is presented in Table S2. The outstanding Faradaic efficiency indicates the sufficient utilization of energy by using Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF as the selective MOR electrocatalysts. It avoids the generation of gaseous product (O2 or CO2) in the anodic reaction, and realizes highly efficient upgrading of methanol to value-added formate in Eq. (9), and the overall reaction of co-electrolysis is proposed as follows (Eqs. (8)–(11)). (8) 4M(OH)2 + 4OH− → 4MOOH + 4e− + 4H2O (9) 4MOOH + 2CH3OH + 6OH− → 2HCOO− + 4e− + 4M(OH)2 + 4H2O (10) 4H2O + 4e− → 2H2 + 4OH− (11) 4MOOH + 2CH3OH + 2OH− → 4M(OH)2 + 2HCOO− + 2H2 As for the methanol oxidation reactions, previous studies demonstrated that the noble metal-based electrocatalysts exhibits robust activity but poor stability, which is due to the strong adsorption of intermediate CO, resulting in the deactivation of catalyst and the methanol is fully oxidized into valueless CO2 [40,41]. Besides, many researches illustrate that the formation of higher oxidation states of transition metal [Eq. (8), M3+ e.g. Ni3+, Co3+] is the necessary prerequisite for the selective oxidation of alcohols and other organic molecules [8,13,29,32,56]. In this regard, electrochemical oxidation of selective methanol in our study can be attributed to the changed valence of transition metals, and their redox behavior which is responsible for the catalytic performance can be modified by the synergy of second species [26,31,32]. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the activity of different NiCo-LDHs towards MOR. Fig. S3 shows that the oxidation peak prior to the OER is correlated with the M2+ being oxidized to M3+ (Eq. (8)). The current density of oxidation peak in the case of Ni/Co = 2:1 is obviously greater than counterparts with different compositions, indicating much higher population of electrochemically-accessible metal cations being generated. As shown in the Fig. 1(e–f), the highly open and ultrathin Co x P@NiCo-LDH catalyst layer construct a hierarchical hetero-architecture, which could expose rich active sites and synergy effect. The phosphorus doping into cobalt crystal lattices also enhances the reaction kinetics of electrocatalysts since the P atoms with more electronegativity can grab electrons from metal atoms, and act as Lewis base to work with positively charged proton through the mass transfer in the nanostructure [50–53]. As shown in Figs. 4(a, b) and S4, the Co x P@NiCo-LDH displays outstanding current density towards MOR than other counterparts, indicating the fast charge transfer and excellent electrochemical activity. The cathodic HER performance of the as-prepared electrodes is also tested in order to investigate their bifunctionality. The HER activity is evaluated in the same electrolyte by using graphite rod as the counter electrode. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the Co(OH)2/NF exhibits sluggish HER kinetics with high overpotential while the sample after phosphorization show excellent HER performance. In comparison, the overpotential of Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 100 mV, much lower than 137 mV of Co x P/NF, which is comparable to the benchmark transition metal-based HER catalysts (Table S3). The HER performance of Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF in different electrolyte is evaluated (Fig. S8), its performance in methanol electrolyte is similar to that of HER in alkaline solution, indicating that the participation of methanol does not affect the performance of the electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the corresponding Tafel plots of catalysts are shown in Fig. 5(b). The Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF electrode exhibits the lowest Tafel slope (75 mV dec−1) comparing with Co(OH)2/NF (125 mV dec−1) and Co x P/NF (83 mV dec−1), revealing the phosphorization and surface modification is kinetically beneficial for HER [50–53,57]. The superior activity of Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF towards MOR and HER can be deduced from the following evidence in our study. First of all, P doping might facilitate the charge transfer. This is further evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The Nyquist plots of Co(OH)2/NF, Co x P/NF and Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF in 1.0 M KOH/0.5 M methanol are recorded at 1.35 V vs. RHE. As shown in Fig. 5(c), Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance (R ct) of 1.41 Ω comparing with that of Co x P/NF (1.82 Ω) and Co(OH)2/NF (3.47 Ω), indicating significantly enhance charge transfer kinetics. Besides, the double-layer capacitances (C dl) estimate from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves is applied to evaluate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) (Fig. S7a–c). The C dl of Co(OH)2/NF electrode is calculated to be 1.95 mF cm−2, smaller than that of Co x P/NF (3.86 mF cm−2) and Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF (3.97 mF cm−2) as shown in Fig. S7(d), suggesting the increasing amount of active sites for MOR and HER after surface modification to form heterostructure. Therefore, the as-prepared hierarchical heteronanostructure of Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF optimizes the surface activity, accelerates the charge transfer and strengthen hetero-interface, leading to the remarkable MOR and HER performance. Encouraged by the superior bifunctionality, a two-electrode system employing Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF as both cathode and anode is assembled to simultaneously produce value-added formate and H2. The Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution reaction at different current densities is also investigated by on-line gas chromatography (GC). As shown in Fig. S9, the signal of H2 gradually increases at different current densities, and no any other gaseous product is detected. The average Faradaic efficiency of HER is around 96%. Impressively, the electrolyzer requires a mere 1.43 V vs. RHE to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and 1.50 V vs. RHE to reach 20 mA cm−2, which is about 242 mV less than that for the overall water splitting (Fig. 6(a)). This performance is comparable to other reported bifunctional electrocatalysts coupling anodic oxidation reactions and H2 production (Table S4). Moreover, the multi-current method in Fig. 6(b) shows corresponding potentials of MOR is almost 200–300 mV lower than that of OER, further illustrating the effectiveness of the Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF electrocatalysts towards MOR. Fig. 6(c) exhibits the durability of the electrode in a methanol-containing symmetrical electrolyzer. The cell voltage remains almost constant for 20 h, demonstrating the excellent stability of Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF electrode as the bifunctional catalyst. Besides, as shown in Fig. 6(d–f), the half-reactions occur simultaneously in this co-electrolysis process (Fig. 6(e)). As expected, the selective methanol oxidation reaction at the anode does not generate any bubble as shown in Fig. 6(d) since formate is the only product without O2 or CO2 evolution, indicating the high selectivity in oxidation of methanol to formate which surpasses the competitive OER. The hydrogen evolution of the cathode is significant in Fig. 6(f) as bubbles are obviously generated. It is further evident that the electrode can realize simultaneous hydrogen evolution and selective oxidation of methanol to produce value-added formate."
6,Conclusions,"Hierarchical Co x P@NiCo-LDH/NF heteronanosheets arrays are designed and fabricated as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for co-electrolysis of methanol/water. The electrocatalysts demonstrate nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency towards the selective oxidation of methanol for co-generation of value-added formate and H2. The two-electrode electrolyzer only requires a low voltage of 1.43 V to achieve selective methanol oxidation and HER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The superior charge transfer introduced by cobalt phosphides nanoarray contribute significantly to the outstanding reaction kinetics with excellent stability. Furthermore, the electrodeposited Ni–Co hydroxide ultrathin nanosheets catalyst layer greatly facilitates the electrocatalytic activity and exposes large number of active sites in the hetero-interfaces. This unique strategy of methanol/water co-electrolysis exploits a new pathway towards selective alcohol upgrading and H2 production with less energy input."
