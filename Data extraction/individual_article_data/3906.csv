0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered a promising alternative fuel with its utilization for fuel cells gaining increasing acceptance as the environmental impacts of hydrocarbon fuels become more evident [1,2]. Hydrogen is a clean fuel as its combustion releases the chemical energy stored in the H–H bond producing water as a by-product. Currently, hydrogen production is about 48 million metric tons per year globally from non-renewable sources such as fossil fuels [3]. Thus, gasification of waste products is gaining increasing acceptance as a carbon neutral approach to obtain sustainable hydrogen. However, the water content of waste biomass is generally high, in the range of 90% or higher [1]. Using thermochemical conversion requires prior drying which consumes a large amount of energy due to the high heat capacity of water [1]. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) technology avoids the need for drying of the waste biomass feed, which makes it suitable for handling feedstocks that contain high moisture contents. Compared to conventional combustion processes such as incineration, SCWG does not produce NO x compounds due to the significantly lower operating temperatures [4]. Also, thermochemical processes such as steam reforming and pyrolysis produce large amounts of undesirable products including chars and tars (higher hydrocarbons) at the expense of product gases such as H2 [1,5]. SCWG is an emerging technology that can treat hazardous wastewater streams as well as producing syngas (H2 and CO). Compared to conventional hydrogen production methods such as bioconversion, the catalytic supercritical water gasification (CSCWG) has proven to be one of the most promising hydrogen production methods for renewable resources [2,6–8]. SCW can dissolve most organic substances and gases and has low viscosity and strong transportability [2,4,5,9]. Above the critical point of water (374°C, 22.1MPa) all organic compounds are present in a single, dense fluid phase, minimizing mass-transfer resistance and accelerating reaction rates [9]. The gaseous product composition of waste biomass model compounds from SCWG significantly depends on the reactant concentration [6] and temperature [4,10,11]. The extreme operating conditions required for the SCW process, i.e. high pressure and temperature reduces its economic attractiveness due to the exotic metals required, e.g. Hastelloy. The use of catalysts in the SCW process has been shown to decrease the operating temperatures by reducing the activation energy which would reduce the material cost for the SCW process [12]. Therefore, a proper catalyst design for hydrogen production is vital to enhance the H2 yield, selectivity, and to reduce the undesirable by-products using CSCWG. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts (such as NaOH, KOH, activated carbon, metallic catalysts) have been examined. For instance, Watanabe et al. [13] studied the partial oxidative gasification of n-hexadecane (n-C16) and organosolv-lignin (lignin) using NaOH and ZrO2 catalysts in a batch reactor from 400 to 440°C. They reported that the H2 yields with zirconia and NaOH were double and quadruple the 4% molar yield without catalyst. Also, Yu et al. [6] reported that the achievement of 95% carbon gasification and higher in SCW from glucose requires a reaction temperature above 600°C. The decomposition of aromatic compounds in SCW was reported by Osada et al. [7] using the supported noble metal catalysts, i.e. ruthenium, rhodium, platinum, and palladium. The aforementioned authors pointed out that lignin is first converted to alkylphenols and formaldehyde through hydrolysis in SCW, after which, the alkylphenols and formaldehyde decompose to gaseous products with the aid of the catalyst. In another study, Osada et al. [8] pointed out that the ruthenium metal particles aggregated during the gasification of coal and waste plastics due to the drastic decrease of the Al2O3 support surface area as well as its crystal structure change from γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3. Furthermore, Yamaguchi et al. [14] reported that activated carbon supported noble metal catalysts, i.e. ruthenium, rhodium, platinum, palladium, and nickel showed higher H2 and CO selectivity during the gasification of lignin and woody biomass. According to Cortright et al. [15], H2 selectivity was evaluated to know how many hydrogen atoms in an organic compound can be taken out as H2 in the gas phase. Thus, higher selectivity for H2 and CO is desirable as CO is expected to increase the H2 yield through the water-gas shift reaction (CO+H2O⇋CO2 +H2). The role of gasification using the aforementioned catalysts is primarily to promote the water-gas shift reaction as well as to facilitate the decomposition of intermediates which eventually increases the overall gas yield. In light of the ever increasing stringent environmental regulations, limited land availability, and a paradigm shift towards resource recovery, sewage sludges (typically 41% proteins, 10–25% lipids, 14% carbohydrates) are becoming increasingly popular feedstocks of interest for SCW processes [16]. Recently, several studies have been carried out on the gasification of biomass or waste biomass in SCW [6,11,17,18] and aqueous organic wastes [19,20]. Despite the occurrence of lipids and LCFAs in sewage sludge (≈25%), neither lipids nor long chain fatty acids (LCFA) have been explored for hydrogen production using SCW. Thus, the overall objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of H2 production from oleic acid using SCW by examining several commercial heterogeneous catalysts in SCWG. Catalyst selection criteria were mainly based on an extensive literature review, availability of the catalysts, and previous experience with glucose gasification in SCW [21]. Another objective of this study is to characterize the composition and quality of residual liquid products."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Oleic acid (99%), 0.5 wt% Ru/Al2O3 pelletized catalyst, 5% palladium supported on activated carbon, 5% platinum supported on activated carbon, and reduced commercial nickel on silica alumina (63 wt% nickel) catalysts were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). KATALCO (high temperature hydrogenation catalyst) and 0.5 wt% Ru/AC (Granular) catalysts were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA). The 18mΩ de-ionized water was obtained using a compact ultrapure water system (EASY pure LF, Mandel Scientific co, model BDI-D7381)."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup Experiments were performed in the main reactor body which was obtained from Autoclave Engineers (Erie, Penn, USA). The reactor was constructed of Hastelloy C-276 with a capacity of 600ml with operating pressure of 36MPa rating at 500°C. The reactor was heated with a 1.5kW electric furnace that surrounded its main body supplied by the same manufacturer. A detailed description of the experimental setup and the procedure was reported elsewhere by Youssef et al. [21]."
4,Feed preparation,2.3 Feed preparation An emulsion of oleic acid (0.35M and 28000mgCOD/L) was prepared using purified water by mechanical mixing and heating. The prepared feed was kept well mixed until delivered to the syringe pump where it was subsequently pressurized and injected to the reactor.
5,Gas sampling and analysis,"2.4 Gas sampling and analysis Analysis of the product gases was performed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 120/80 D Hayesep stainless steel packed column (Grace Davidson) having dimensions of 6.2m long, and 3.18mm inside diameter. Helium was used as the carrier gas. The GC was calibrated using a standard gas mixture of known composition containing H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. The analysis was performed manually using 1ml SGE gas tight syringe (Model number 008100, Reno, NV USA) by collecting the sample from a Tedlar gas bag obtained from SKC Inc (PA, USA). The analysis was performed at least three times for each sample to minimize experimental error."
6,Liquid product analysis,"2.5 Liquid product analysis The organic content of the process liquid effluent was examined by measuring the total and soluble chemical oxygen demand (TCOD, SCOD) using HACH methods and test kits (HACH Odyssey DR/2500). The analysis of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was also conducted using a gas chromatograph (Varian 8500) with a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a fused silica column having dimensions of 30m length×0.32mm internal diameter with helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 5ml/min. The temperatures of the column and detector were 110 and 250°C, respectively. For carbon balance closure requirements, the effluent liquid total organic carbon (TOC) was measured using a Shimadzu TOC-VCPH TOC analyzer. The liquid effluent samples were extracted four times with aliquots of dichloromethane in order to identify components using GC–MS. The extraction was performed by first adjusting the pH to 2 using 0.6M HCl followed by placing the sample in a 300ml separatory funnel. The extracted samples were left in the separatory funnel for 1h after which the immiscible phases were separated. The organic extract was kept in air tight glass vials for further analysis. Long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), namely, palmitic, myristic, stearic, linoleic, and oleic acid were determined using a calibrated Agilent gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an HP-5 capillary column 30m long, 0.25mm internal diameter with a film thickness of 0.25μm. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 100°C (hold for 2min) and rose at 10°C/ min to 250°C. The injector and detector were operated at 250°C; while nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.9ml/ min and a pressure of 11.2psi. The compounds present in the liquid samples were further identified using a Varian 3400GC–MS fitted with a 30m long, and 0.32mm internal diameter DB-5ms capillary column, and a film thickness 0.25μm. The GC–MS was coupled to a Finnigan MAT 8400 ion-trap detector. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 45°C (hold for 3min) and raised at 5°C/ min to 310°C (hold for 3min); the injector and the detector were operated at 250°C. Compound identification was performed by employing an automatic comparison of the derived ion mass spectra to spectral libraries using HP Chemstation software using similarity indexes (SI) of greater than 75%."
7,Data interpretation,"2.6 Data interpretation Oleic acid gasification reactions and the relevant processes can be approximated by the following. Oleic acid reforming to CO and H2: (1) C18H34O2 +16H2O→18CO+33H2 Water-gas shift reaction: (2) CO+H2O⇋CO2 +H2 Methanation reactions: (3) CO+3H2 →CH4 +H2O (4) CO2 +4H2 →CH4 +2H2O The calculations of product gas yield and carbon balance were performed as follows: (5) Gas yield = ( mol of gas species produced ) / ( mol of oleic acid converted ) where: (6) mol of oleic acid converted = moles of oleic acid in the feed − moles of oleic acid in the liquid product . (7) Carbon balance = ( moles carbon in the gas + moles carbon in the liquid ) / moles carbon in the feed . For the purpose of COD balance calculations, the product liquid effluent COD was measured whereas the gaseous product COD was calculated. The COD reduction efficiency, the COD balance, and the carbon gasification efficiency are defined as follows: (8) COD reduction efficiency ( % ) = { [ COD initial − COD final ] / [ COD initial ] } × 100 (9) COD balance = [ COD gas product + COD liquid product + COD reactor residual ] / [ COD initial ] (10) Gasification efficiency = carbon in the product gas / carbon in the feed The procedure for calculating residual COD in the reactor after the end of each experiment was reported elsewhere [21] although generally were found to be insignificant in this work and hence not reported. To ensure experimental reproducibility, two runs were selected randomly and repeated at the exact same conditions, and the overall error was found to be less than 5%."
8,Equilibrium calculations,"2.7 Equilibrium calculations Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed using ChemCad software (Chemstations Inc, Houston, TX, USA). The mass and energy balance around the reactor was performed using the Gibbs free energy minimization (GFEM) reactor model. This technique does not consider the reaction pathways and calculates the equilibrium gas composition based on 100% conversion efficiency and the pre-defined product species. The aforementioned product species were selected based on the observed experimental results and include H2, CH4, CO, CO2, ethylene and ethane."
9,Results,"To obtain a synopsis of the expected oleic acid gasification gas yields, Fig. 1a portrays the calculated theoretical gas yield as mole gas per mole oleic acid fed (using the commercial software ChemCad) as a function of temperature at 28MPa. Ten wt% oleic acid was used at this is a typical composition for the feed stream of interest corresponding to 28000mgCOD/L. Increasing temperature leads to a sharp increase in the H2 yield, a dramatic decrease in the CH4 yield, and a slight increase in the CO yield. The calculated theoretical gas composition with change of the oleic acid feed concentration is portrayed in Fig. 1b. As the concentration increased from 1 to 30 wt%, the H2 and CO2 yields both decreased dramatically, with the H2 yield giving a sharper decrease. The effect of concentration on the H2 yield is noticeable at a concentration range from 1 to 5 wt% which coincides with a rapid increase in the CH4 yield. As will be shown experimentally, the model results were based on a complete oleic acid conversion, which did not go to completion. As such, we reported the gas yield in this work in terms of mole gas/mole feed and mole gas/mole oleic acid converted."
10,Effect of temperature and catalysts on the product gas,"3.1 Effect of temperature and catalysts on the product gas Fig. 2a–c shows the distribution of the gaseous product yields measured in SCWG without using a catalyst at the three investigated reactor temperatures of 400, 450, and 500°C. As expected, the total gas product increased significantly with increasing temperature. The product gas composition was mainly composed of H2, CH4, CO2, and a small amount of CO. The total gas volume at a temperature of 400°C was 27% and 8% of the gas volume produced at 450°C and 500°C, respectively. Specifically, the H2 gas yield increased by 48% and 80% as the temperature increased from 400 to 450 and 500°C, respectively. However, the experimental H2 yield was significantly less than the calculated at the three investigated temperatures as shown in Fig. 2a. In fact, the experimental H2 yield was 51%, 42%, and 59% less than the calculated yield at 400, 450, and 500°C, respectively. This difference is attributed to the fact that the model calculates the gas composition based on complete conversion of the feed into gaseous products, and as described below; significant residual liquid products are formed which inhibited gas formation. Similar to the observations with H2, the observed experimental CH4 yield was significantly less than the calculated equilibrium at the three investigated temperatures, i.e. 400, 450, and 500°C. At 500°C, a dramatic increase in the CH4 gas yield of 8.5mol/mol oleic acid converted is observed coupled with a substantial CO yield of 2mol/mol oleic acid converted compared to 400 and 450°C. It should be pointed out that the amount of CO produced was 0 in all cases except at 500°C where it was 0.2mol CO/mol feed and 2mol CO/mol oleic acid converted. As oleic acid gasification has not been measured in SCWG, a catalyst screening study was undertaken using several commercially available gasification catalysts. A temperature of 500°C was chosen for catalyst testing to provide the highest gas yield at the maximum vessel pressure/temperature capability. As depicted in Fig. 3a and b, the use of catalysts enhanced the product gas yield significantly except for the high temperature shift catalyst (KATALCO). For KATALCO, the measured H2 yield of 2mol/mol oleic acid converted was the same as without using any catalyst, i.e. 40 % below the equilibrium calculated yield. However, the gas yield increased significantly using the other catalysts, with the order of H2 production was following: pelletized Ru/Al2O3 >powder Ni/Silica–alumina>powder Pt/AC>granular Ru/AC>powder Pd/AC>KATALCO. Both the pelletized Ru/Al2O3 and powder Ni/Silica–alumina catalyst surpassed the other catalysts in terms of H2 yield, giving 15mol/mol oleic acid converted which was 4 times higher than that without a catalyst. Based on the moles of oleic acid fed, the H2 yield for the Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Silica–alumina catalysts was 1.5mol, which translates to 44% of the theoretical yield. Thus, it is clear that the incorporation of catalyst increased the H2 production significantly, although still fell short of the maximum theoretically achievable yield. Although the amount of 2g catalyst was the same in all experiments, it should be pointed out that the Ru metal loading was 0.5 wt% whereas the nickel, Pd, and Pt metal loadings were 63, 5, and 5 wt%, respectively. Fig. 3a also shows the experimental CH4 yield at 500°C, with the order using the employed catalysts being as follows: pelletized Ru/Al2O3 >powder Pd/AC>powder Pt/AC>powder Ni/Silica–alumina>granular Ru/AC>KATALCO. Again, and similar to the H2 yield trend, the pelletized Ru/Al2O3 catalyst showed a higher gasification activity towards CH4. The CH4 yield with this catalyst as mol/mol oleic acid converted was 40% higher than the yield predicted by the equilibrium calculation, and 73%, 41%, 40%, and 61% higher than the CH4 yield with the KATALCO, powder Pt/AC, powder Pd/AC, and granular Ru/AC catalysts, respectively. Furthermore, both the powder Pt/AC and powder Pd/AC catalysts provided the same CH4 yield experimentally which was also the same as the calculated equilibrium yield. The experimental CO and CO2 yields using all catalysts are reported in Fig. 3b. The powder Pd/AC catalyst exhibited a different behaviour than other catalysts in achieving the highest CO2 yield of 27molCO2/mol oleic acid converted. This observation coincided with a substantial amount of CO of 10mol/mol oleic acid converted. The CO yield was almost zero except when using the powder Pd/AC and granular Ru/AC catalytic experiments, which gave 10 and 1.5mol/mol oleic acid converted, respectively. The order of CO2 yield with the employed catalysts was as follows: powder Pd/AC>pelletized Ru/Al2O3 >powder Ni/Silica–alumina>powder Pt/AC>granular Ru/AC>KATALCO."
11,Effect of temperature and catalysts on the liquid products,"3.2 Effect of temperature and catalysts on the liquid products As described above, significant differences were obtained between the measured and theoretical gaseous yields when using SCWG of oleic acid, necessitating analysis of the residual liquid product characteristics. Table 1 provides the chemical oxygen demand (COD), carbon gasification efficiencies and carbon balance results for the three examined temperatures. The COD levels at 400 and 450°C gasification temperatures remained almost the same as the COD in =28,000mg/L having values of 19,280 and 19,020mg/L, respectively. Although the COD reduction efficiencies were almost the same at 400 and 450°C, i.e. 31% and 32%, respectively, the COD reduction efficiency almost doubled to 60% as the temperature increased from 450 to 500°C. At 400°C, the liquid effluent after SCWG was observed as a homogeneous-milky-white-emulsion which became significantly clearer at 450°C and 500°C. In the presence of the high temperature shift catalyst (KATALCO), the residual COD increased slightly to 12,050mg/L over 11,220mg/L obtained with no catalyst at 500°C. However, the presence of the other catalysts enhanced the COD destruction and significantly decreased the residual COD. For example, the residual COD was 1240mg/L when the Ni/Silica–alumina catalyst was employed which translates to a 90% reduction over that when using no catalyst. In general, the order of COD reduction efficiency was as follows: powder Ni/Silica–alumina>pelletized Ru/Al2O3 >powder Pt/AC>powder Pd/AC>granular Ru/AC>KATALCO. Comparing the carbon gasification efficiency values of all catalysts in Table 1 shows that the efficiency increased for the following catalysts: Ru/Al2O3, powder Ni/Silica–alumina, Pd/AC which was 85%, 81%, and 86%, respectively. Based on the COD reduction values, the Ni/Silica–Alumina catalyst gave the best performance with a COD reduction efficiency of 96% followed by Ru/Al2O3 and Pt/AC catalysts with COD reduction efficiencies of 86%. The KATALCO catalyst performance was the lowest among all catalysts explored achieving a COD reduction efficiency of 57%, similar to that without a catalyst. Nearly the same extent of decomposition of the liquid product was observed for Pt/AC and Ru/Al2O3, with a higher degree of decomposition for Ni/Silica–alumina and Pd/AC catalysts. To obtain further insight into the oleic acid conversion, the formation of long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) after SCWG experiments was measured in the residual liquid fraction using a calibrated and verified GC, with the results provided in Table 2 . The residual LCFA concentration increased dramatically as the temperature increased from 400 to 450°C. However, when the temperature was further increased to 500°C, a sharp decrease in the LCFA concentrations occurred. At 500°C, the oleic acid conversion was higher than its conversion at 400 and 450°C with a concentration in the residual liquid product of 3mmol/L and (COD) of 11,220mg/L. From Table 2, the LCFA and VFA concentration distribution during the catalytic experiments was significant. For example, the oleic acid concentration during pelletized Ru/Al2O3 catalytic experiment was 40 times higher than the residual liquid concentration when using the Ni/Silica–alumina catalyst. Moreover, the concentrations of stearic, and linoleic acids were significantly higher when using the Ru/Al2O3 catalysts than when using the Ni/Silica–alumina catalyst, which was the most active. The residual concentrations of VFAs with the Ni/Silica–alumina catalyst were only 20% of the concentration observed with the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. The most commonly observed VFA was propionic acid while only traces of acetic and butyric acids were observed except when the Ru/AC catalyst was employed. Furthermore, in the thermal decomposition of oleic acid, propionic, stearic, linoleic acids were always found as major carboxylic acid products."
12,GC–MS characterization of liquid product from oleic acid in SCW,"3.3 GC–MS characterization of liquid product from oleic acid in SCW Table 3 reports the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) results of the residual liquid effluent. Identifying the compounds was performed by employing an automatic comparison of the derived ion mass spectra to NIST or Wiley spectral libraries. At 400°C, the products were composed of carboxylic and saturated fatty acids, fatty acids esters, alkenes, fatty alcohols, n-alkanols, and some cyclo-compounds. At 450°C, the distribution of liquid products shifted towards aromatic and cyclo-compounds, i.e. isomers of xylene such as m-xylene, p-xylene and o-xylene as well as cyclododecanol. At 500°C, the aforementioned compounds disappeared, with heptanoic and hexanoic acids, cresol, and two ketones being the only observed organics. When using the Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/AC catalysts at 500°C, the organics were composed mainly of: (i) aromatic hydrocarbons such as m, o, and p-xylene, toluene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, methylnaphthalene, and azulene; and (ii) polycyclic hydrocarbons such as indane and indene. It was observed that the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was highly selective for aromatic hydrocarbons since no aliphatic hydrocarbons were detected."
13,Catalyst sustainability and performance,"3.4 Catalyst sustainability and performance In this study, the assessment of catalyst deactivation was limited to an examination of the surface area, gasification efficiency, and liquid quality parameters with Table 4 providing the details. Both catalysts Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/AC were significantly deactivated from the first run as reflected by a 60 and 50% reduction in the H2 yield, respectively. A reduction of 70% and 40% in the CH4 yield was also observed for both Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/AC catalysts, respectively. The BET surface areas of both fresh and used catalysts reported in Table 4 show a substantial decrease in the surface area of both catalysts after the second run. The BET surface area decreased from 100m2/g to 17m2/g for the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst and from 1069m2/g to 220m2/g for the Ru/AC catalyst. The GC–MS results in Table 3 show that when re-using the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst for a second SCWG experiment, the distribution of the compounds was almost the same as with the fresh catalyst. During the second run when using the Ru/AC catalyst, most of the aromatic hydrocarbons detected during the first run (i.e. toluene, ethylbenzene, and substituted benzene compounds), were not detected during the second run."
14,Discussion,
15,Effect of temperature and catalysts on the product gas,"4.1 Effect of temperature and catalysts on the product gas Higher temperatures were found to facilitate higher gas yields during the SCWG of oleic acid as portrayed in Fig. 2a–c. At higher temperatures, gaseous products are formed through decomposition of fatty acids as well as reforming reactions of oleic acid (Eq. (1)) [22]. This is also supported by the oleic acid conversion at 500°C in Table 2, which was higher than its conversion at 400 and 450°C. The oleic acid concentration in the residual liquid product at 500°C of 3mmol/L corresponds to a 23% and 48% reduction over those measured at 400 and 450°C, respectively. In order to rationalize the dramatic change in the composition of the product gas in relation to the residual liquid components, we relate the H2 contribution in the reaction to the formation of liquid compounds. H2 is usually produced by dehydrogenation of the saturated compounds forming olefins, along with the water-gas shift reaction (Eq. (2)). On the other hand, hydrogen may also be consumed through various other reaction routes including methane formation reactions (reactions (3) and (4)), stabilization of hydrocarbon radicals, and hydrogenation reactions [23–26]. For example, the presence of stearic acid as a saturated fatty acid in the liquid phase suggests that the hydrogenation of the oleic acid double bond occurred. Hydrogenation requires H2 to proceed which implies that some of the H2 produced by other routes was consumed through the hydrogenation reaction route. The observed increase of CH4 yield at 500°C was significant which implies its formation through either the decomposition of intermediate compounds or through Eq. (4). This is also supported by the presence of noticeable amounts of CO at 500°C, which suggests that the rate of CO consumption to form either H2 through Eq. (2) or CH4 through Eq. (3) was minimal. Furthermore, at 400 and 450°C, the residual liquid COD was almost the same whereas the COD at 500°C was about 42% lower than at 400 and 450°C. Approximately, 96% of the increase in the formed gas was from the 42% decrease in the COD. This implies that most of the gas formed at 500°C was through the decomposition of the formed intermediate compounds. Thus, the measured H2 in the product gas is the difference between the amount of H2 produced and consumed. The increase in both CO2 and CO suggests that decarbonylation and decarboxylation of intermediates occurred which is also supported by the remarkable decrease in the concentration of LCFAs and VFAs. Consequently, H2 concentration in the gas phase increased with the temperature rise which was found to be in a good agreement with the results for sewage sludge gasification in SCW reported by Zhang et al. [27]. The aforementioned authors pointed out that higher temperature facilitates the necessary free-radical reactions required for gas formation. Furthermore, and as reported by Yu et al. [6] who predicted the equilibrium gas composition during glucose gasification in supercritical water, the expected gaseous products at equilibrium are H2, CH4, and CO2 with traces of CO. The aforementioned author’s equilibrium calculations showed that higher temperatures favored gaseous product formation. The effect of temperature on the gas formation is demonstrated by the performed equilibrium gas composition calculations in this work (Fig. 1a) which showed that oleic acid requires temperature above 750°C to liberate the H2 contained in the oleic acid into the gas phase. In their gasification experiments with lignin, Yamaguchi et al. [14] reported that the Ru/AC catalyst was the most active for lignin gasification (%) consistent with our observed results which showed the highest carbon gasification efficiency and COD reduction efficiency (%) of 85% and 86%, respectively. Moreover, the CH4 produced during the experiment with Ru/Al2O3 was 75% higher than the powder Pt/AC and powder Pd/AC catalysts, and 95% higher than the powder Ni/Silica–alumina catalyst. This was found to be in a good agreement with the observations of Osada et al. [7,8] using Ru as an active metal for methanation reaction as per Eqs. (3) and (4). The negligible CO yield (almost 0mol/mol oleic acid converted) with the powder Ni/Silica–alumina, pelletized Ru/Al2O3, powder Pt/AC catalysts suggests the occurrence of the water-gas shift reaction. According to Cortright et al. [15], the C–C bond cleavage occurring on the catalyst surface produces CO and H2. CO reacts with H2O to produce H2 and CO2 through the water-gas shift reaction. Furthermore, the formation of carbon oxides, i.e. CO and CO2 was through decarbonylation and decarboxylation of oxygenated hydrocarbons such as fatty acids and esters to saturated, unsaturated hydrocarbon, CO, and CO2 [28]. From Table 2, the higher observed oleic acid concentration in the residual liquid product during pelletized Ru/Al2O3 catalytic experiment relative to the other catalysts implies that oleic acid with Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was initially converted to product gases as per equation 1 followed by the methanation reaction (Eqs. (3) and (4)). On the other hand, the rate of methanation reactions seemed to be slower during Ni/Silica–alumina catalytic experiments as the methane yield was 50% lower than the pelletized Ru/Al2O3 catalytic experiment."
16,Effect of temperature and catalysts on the liquid product,"4.2 Effect of temperature and catalysts on the liquid product At the lowest operating temperature of 400°C, the formation of long chain compounds was more favorable at the expense of gasification. This implies that the thermal decomposition of saturated fatty acids and fatty acid esters was minimal. This observation is consistent with Marquevich et al. [29] who conducted steam reforming experiments of sunflower oil, reported that at temperatures below 450°C, the carbon conversion ratio in the feed to product gas was minimal of less than 5%. The aforementioned authors also pointed out that linoleic, oleic, and stearic acids were identified as the major liquid products indicating that the C–C bond cleavage reaction of the unsaturated fatty acid chains did not take place. This finding is also in good agreement with that reported by Williams and Onwudili [22], who observed that higher temperatures favor the formation of fatty acids, and articulated that the concentration of oleic and palmitic acids in the produced oil from hydrothermal reforming of bio-diesel plant waste increased by 40% and 100% upon increasing the temperature from 380°C to 440°C. Holliday et al. [30] pointed out that both saturated acids such as myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids, and free fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acids were reasonably stable during hydrolysis at temperatures below 300°C. At 450°C, the liquid products were composed mainly of aromatic and cyclo-compounds. Isomers of xylene, i.e. m-xylene, p-xylene and o-xylene as well as cyclododecanol were also observed. The absence of alkenes and the presence of aromatic isomers coupled with increased H2 production suggest that the aromatization reactions increased with increasing the cracking temperature as a result of dehydrogenation, similar to that reported by Savage [23]. The decrease in the number of saturated fatty acids and fatty acid esters identified is consistent with the corresponding increase in product gas concentrations. This indicates that the thermal decomposition or cracking of the aforementioned compounds was faster as it is also known that the unsaturated acids are thermally unstable and decompose by both thermal and oxidative routes [23,29]. As the temperature increased to 500°C, heptanoic and hexanoic acids, cresol, and two ketones were observed, and it is interesting to note that the concentration of LCFAs, VFAs also decreased. This suggests that the thermal decomposition of the aforementioned acids was very fast, hence minimizing the occurrence of other possible reaction routes. The thermal decomposition of the LCFAs and VFAs was translated into more gaseous products at 500°C which also helps confirm the observed reduction in residual liquid effluent COD. A similar trend was observed with the VFA distribution, primarily due to decarboxylation and decarbonylation of these carboxylic acids. The absence of n-alkanes, n-alkenes, and cyclo-compounds suggests that the generation path of the radicals such as RCOO was limited as it is reported that the RCOO radical would be responsible for the presence of n-alkanes and n-alkenes in the mixture through disproportionation and successive eliminations of ethylene [23,26,28,29]. In summary, the presence of heptanoic and hexanoic acids, cresol, and two ketones indicates that several intermediate compounds were formed. These intermediates had undergone two possible simultaneous routes; thermal decomposition to product gas through decarboxylation, dehydrogenation and aromatization reactions which facilitate the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Eventually, as reported by Marquevich et al. [29], the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons leads to the formation of radicals which conjugated with phenol to form cresols. On the other hand, it was observed that Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was highly selective for aromatic hydrocarbons and no aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds were detected. This observation is contradictory to the one reported by Sai et al. [24] and Katikaneni et al. [25] who studied the catalytic cracking of canola oil to produce hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals. It should be pointed out that the aforementioned authors experimental conditions were significantly different than those employed here, i.e. atmospheric pressure and 290–410°C compared to 28MPa and 500°C in this work. The shift in the product distribution may have resulted from the effect of SCW properties due to high pressure and temperature as well as the catalyst. The unique presence of aromatic hydrocarbons, namely, xylene, benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene indicates that the Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/AC catalysts facilitate the Diels−Alder addition of ethylene to a conjugated diene. Sarkai et al. [31] reported that the decarboxylation of oleic acid and other LCFA led to the formation of aromatic-cyclic hydrocarbons. When the C–C dehydrogenation takes place, it facilitates more double-bond formation in the hydrocarbon chains which eventually increases the tendency for aromatic hydrocarbon formation. On the other hand, the detection of compounds such as 2-propenylidene-cyclobutene and stearic acid methyl ester during the second run of Ru/Al2O3 catalyst indicates that the gasification activity of Ru/Al2O3 catalyst towards saturated fatty acids such as stearic, palmitic acids, LCFA esters and oleic acid was diminished. This is also supported by the BET surface area results reported in Table 4 which shows that the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was significantly deactivated during the first run as reflected by the substantial decrease in the gaseous products yield and the observed increase of the residual liquid products COD."
17,Catalyst deactivation,"4.3 Catalyst deactivation The stability of the Ru catalyst supports, i.e. Al2O3 and AC was investigated as their recovery was possible. The investigation focused mainly on the effect of reusing the catalyst on both the gas yield and the residual liquid effluent quality. As reported in Table 4, both catalysts, i.e. Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/AC were significantly deactivated in the first run which is reflected by a substantial reduction in the both the H2 and CH4 yields. Osada et al. [8] studied the activity of different Ru supported catalysts; with the catalyst deactivation attributed to the formation of aggregated Ru particles. This aggregation is a result of the drastic decrease of the Al2O3 support surface area which occurs due to its crystal structure change from γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3. The aforementioned authors also reported that the Ru/AC had similar activity to Ru/TiO2 for the first run, however, the activity of Ru/AC decreased in the second run and the gas yield decreased by 60%. Another observation that corroborates the catalytic deactivation is the reduction in both the COD reduction and carbon gasification efficiencies as reported in Table 4. In addition, the deactivation of the catalyst poses a real challenge since the catalyst role in the SCW process is vital from an economic point of view. This raises the question on how the catalyst was deactivated which can be explained by two phenomena, i.e. coke formation and crystal structure change. As reported by Sai et al. [24], who studied the catalytic cracking of fatty acids to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuel using HZSM-5 catalyst at atmospheric pressure, the presence of fatty acids enhances the formation of radicals which leads to coke formation. The aforementioned authors pointed out that the formation of radicals is encouraged by the presence of catalyst as the hydrocarbons formed from fatty acids collide with the catalyst surface and formed radicals. The formed radicals then cracked and formed coke that deposited on the catalyst surface, eventually deactivating it. The second reason could be the instability of the catalyst support which led to changes in its crystal structure as demonstrated by Osada et al. [8]. To provide a better insight, we investigated the distribution of the LCFAs and VFAs in each run in Table 4. A substantial decrease in the concentration of stearic, linoleic, palmitic, and oleic acids in the second run was observed when Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was employed but no change in the concentration of acetic, propionic, and butyric acid was observed. For the Ru/AC catalyst, the concentration ratio of stearic to oleic acid was 1mmol/L in the first run and 0mmol/L in the second run which indicates that the extent of oleic acid decarboxylation reaction decreased drastically in the second run. The absence of palmitic and stearic acids as well as straight-chain paraffins with less than 7 carbon atoms in the second run of Ru/AC catalyst suggests that C–C bond cleavage for saturated oxygenated hydrocarbons takes place prior to the decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions. However, the gasification activity or the catalyst ability for C–C bond cleavage decreased from 60% in the first run to 37% in the second run as reflected by the carbon gasification efficiency. Meanwhile, Savage [23] reported that C–C bond cleavage of unsaturated compounds results in the formation of dienes, short-chain fatty acids, and hydrocarbon radicals. The formation of short-chain fatty acids was not observed in this work as the concentrations of these compounds did not increase as shown in Table 4. Thus, it is likely that the decarboxylation of fatty acids containing CC resulted in the formation of long chain cyclic hydrocarbons through formation of dienes followed by a Diels–Alder addition of diene to other olefins followed by cyclization."
18,Possible reaction pathways,"4.4 Possible reaction pathways Knowledge of the reaction mechanism is important for proper catalyst selection and design. Based on our results and the above discussion, we postulate a reaction scheme for the decomposition of oleic acid in SCW with and without Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/AC catalysts as shown in Fig. 4 .The proposed reaction route is based on the main products observed in both the gas and liquid phases during this experimental work and on the literature for steam reforming and thermal cracking of vegetable oils [15,23–26,28–32]. The main possible reactions that occurred through the formation and disappearance of some intermediate compounds as well as the obtained gaseous and liquid final products are reported in Tables 5a and b ."
19,Conclusions,"Hydrogen was produced from oleic acid used as a model compound for lipids by catalytic supercritical water gasification using several commercial catalysts and process conditions of 400–500°C, 28MPa and 30min reaction time. Results of the non-catalytic experiments showed that higher temperatures facilitate higher H2 production. When studying the various catalysts, the order of H2 production was as follows: pelletized Ru/Al2O3 >powder Ni/Silica–alumina>powder Pt/AC>granular Ru/AC>powder Pd/AC>KATALCO. The order of COD reduction efficiency was as follows: powder Ni/Silica–alumina>pelletized Ru/Al2O3 >powder Pt/AC>powder Pd/AC>granular Ru/AC>KATALCO. Based on the results of this work, the following conclusions can be drawn. (1) The COD reduction efficiency reached a maximum of 96% with Ni/Silica–alumina and as high as 86% with Ru/Al2O3 catalysts. (2) Gasification of oleic acid at the 3 temperature levels in the absence of catalyst revealed that higher temperatures facilitate a faster and more effective thermal decomposition of the LCFAs and VFAs. (3) Ruthenium catalyst favored the methane formation reaction which consumed part of the H2 produced and eventually decreased the H2 yield. (4) The composition of residual liquid products was also studied, characterized using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and a generalized reaction pathway of the oleic acid decomposition in SCW was developed. (5) Both catalysts Ru/Al2O3, and Ru/AC were significantly deactivated in the first run as reflected by 60% and 50% reduction in the H2 yield in the second run, respectively."
