0,Introduction,"The partial hydrogenation of benzene is an interesting chemical reaction from the point of view of both industry and science, mostly because of the cyclohexene. It is a highly reactive compound that can be part of the production chain of many other chemicals. Particularly, from cyclohexene, it is possible to produce cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone which are intermediates compounds in the route for the production of polyamides, such as nylon [1,2]. Moreover, this reaction is a promising alternative to the elimination of benzene, since severe environmental policies have limited the presence of aromatic compounds in fuel [3]. Due to thermodynamic limitations, kinetic strategies are indispensable in order to obtain higher yields of cyclohexene in this chemical process, such as the use of adequate catalysts and reaction media [4]. For this reaction, ruthenium based catalysts, prepared from chlorinated ruthenium species [5] and supported in solids with low specific surface area [6], have been increasingly applied, since higher yields of intermediate product are achieved in the consecutive reaction benzene→cyclohexene→cyclohexane. Incipient and wet impregnation methods have been studied by many researchers for the preparation of Ru catalysts [7,8]. Bu et al. [8] presented a comparison between ruthenium supported on silica (SBA-15) catalysts prepared by both incipient and wet impregnation methods, being the catalysts afterwards reduced under H2 flow. A TEM analysis of the prepared solids revealed that higher metallic dispersion was observed on catalysts prepared by wet impregnation. This same result was also observed by Liu et al. [9]. The higher metallic dispersion observed on catalysts prepared by wet impregnation may also lead to higher cyclohexene yield [8]. Bu et al. [8] reported that Ru/SBA-15 catalysts prepared by wet impregnation presented twice as higher cyclohexene yield than catalysts prepared by incipient impregnation. In addition, the maximum cyclohexene yield for the catalyst prepared by wet impregnation (20%) was obtained at benzene conversion of 60%, while the catalyst prepared by incipient impregnation presented its maximum at a benzene conversion of 30% [8]. Higher yields of cyclohexene are particularly associated to the presence of water in the reaction medium [4]. In this system, the water has the role of keeping the cyclohexene formed away from the catalytic surface, preventing its undesired hydrogenation to cyclohexane. This occurs because of the very low solubility of cyclohexene in water, where hydrophilic catalysts are placed more easily (surrounded by a layer of water). However, the presence of water decreases the mass transfer rate of benzene to the surface of the catalyst and, therefore, decreases the reaction rate. In order to increase even more the production of cyclohexene, ZnSO4 has frequently been added to the liquid reaction medium [7,8,10,11], as well as amines and alcohols [7,11,12]. However, inorganic salts such as ZnSO4 can cause fouling in the reboiler, if the aqueous phase gets carried over, which may have a negative impact on industrial operations [7]. As an alternative to the use of inorganic salts, organic compounds have been incorporated to the reaction medium to act as additives [7]. Fan et al. [11] investigated a bimetallic RuCoB/γ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by wet impregnation and reduced by NaBH4 for partial hydrogenation of benzene with presence of organic compounds in a liquid phase reaction medium that already contained ZnSO4. The highest yields of cyclohexene were observed to diethanolamine (32%), ethanolamine (31%), ethylenediamine (34%) and ethyleneglycol (26%). The authors suggested that amines and alcohols stabilize the water layer around the catalysts surface. In addition, the coordination between the amines and alcohols with the Ru may weaken its bonds with cyclohexene, by charging Ru particles with electrons [11]. Spinacé and Vaz [12] studied the addition of different alcohols in the reaction medium for the hydrogenation of benzene on Ru/SiO2 catalyst. The highest cyclohexene selectivity (60%) was obtained with the addition of ethyleneglycol. The authors suggested that this result was due to the absence of hydrophobic groups in the ethyleneglycol molecule and also to the interaction between the hydroxyl groups, presents in the solvent molecules, and the water molecules surrounding the catalyst particles. Employing a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by incipient impregnation, Suryawanshi and Mahajani [7] compared the addition of ZnSO4 and monoethanolamine to the reaction medium. The authors obtained higher selectivity of cyclohexene (56%) for the addition of 500ppm of monoethanolamine, against a selectivity of 48% for the addition of 0.30g of ZnSO4. Additionally, the authors pointed out that the ZnSO4 salt may lead to fouling on the process equipments due to the formation of insoluble Zn(OH)2 during reaction. Considering the exposed, the principal aim of the present work is to study the effects of additives in the reaction medium on the performance of Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/CeO2 catalysts for the partial hydrogenation of benzene in the liquid phase."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparations,"2.1 Catalysts preparations Alumina (Al2O3) and ceria (CeO2), both of commercial grade, were used as received as catalysts support. Alumina (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) was in alpha phase, with an average particle diameter of 1μm, whereas ceria (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.9%) was in fluorite form with an average particle diameter inferior to 5μm. The catalysts were prepared in order to present 5wt% of Ru, from the precursor RuCl3·xH2O obtained from Sigma–Aldrich with 99.9% purity. In the incipient impregnation method, an aqueous solution of precursor was added drop by drop to a dry amount of the support. Then, the solid was left at room temperature for 12h being afterwards dried at 358K for 24h. In sequence, these catalysts were reduced under a 40mL/min flow of H2 from the room temperature until 573K, remaining at this temperature for 3h, as described by Zonetti et al. [13]. All catalysts prepared by this method and reduced under H2 flow have the IH abbreviation in its denominations. In the wet impregnation method, deionized water was added to the support resulting in a suspension continuously agitated at room temperature by a magnetic stirrer. An aqueous solution of the precursor salt was then slowly added to this suspension. Afterwards, the resultant suspension was heated until 353K and then its pH was adjusted to 10 by adding an aqueous solution of NaOH. Formaldehyde (Merck, 37wt%) was used as reduction agent for the RuCl3 present in the suspension, which in sequence was filtrated in a Büchner funnel. The remaining solid was washed with deionized water in order to remove residual chlorine, sodium and formaldehyde. The solids were washed until a test with AgNO3 did not reveal residual chlorine and a flame test did not indicate the presence of sodium. In the case of the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation and not submitted to reduction, this preparation was conducted without the addition of formaldehyde to the suspension. Finally, the catalyst was dried at 358K for 24h. All catalysts prepared by this method and reduced with formaldehyde have the WF abbreviation in its denominations. Some catalysts prepared by wet impregnation were not reduced with formaldehyde. In this case, the solids were submitted to a reduction under H2 flow after the wet impregnation. These catalysts have the WH abbreviation in its denominations."
3,Supports and catalysts characterizations,"2.2 Supports and catalysts characterizations The supports Al2O3 and CeO2 were characterized by potentiometric titration in order to determine its respective isoelectric points. A digital Analyser pHmeter model 300M was used to take pH measurements according to the procedure of Strelko and Malik [14]. The specific surface area of the solids was determined through N2 physisorption (BET method). A sample of 1.00g of each solid was previously dried at 473K under vacuum and the physisorption was conducted at 77K in a Tristar Micromeritics equipment. Scanning electronic microscopy coupled with spectrometric X-ray analysis (SEM+EDX) was used with the principal aim of evaluating semi-quantitatively the chemical composition of the catalysts. The analyses were conducted in a LEO 440i Leica equipment. Before insertion in the SEM, all samples were covered with a fine layer of gold atoms using a 3mA current for 180s in order to obtain a gold film thickness of 92Å. TEM analyses were carried out on a Libra 120 Zeiss microscope with Cantega 2k/Olympus CCD camera and iTEM data acquisition platform. The samples were gently grinded and then dispersed in water. The dispersion was placed on ultrasound for 10min and then left to rest for another 10min. A drop of the solution was placed on a 300mesh copper grid coated with parlodium and carbon. The grids were dried at ambient temperature and examined at 80kV and using the energy filter at zero loss, 25eV, 30eV or 50eV. The energy positions 25eV and 50eV correspond to the first and second plasmon. X-ray photoelectrons spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted in order to study the chemical composition on the surface of the catalysts. A spherical analyzer VSWHA-100 with aluminum anode (Al Kα, h v =1486.6eV) was used. The pressure during the analyses was inferior to 2.10−8 mbar. To correct bonding energies, the line C 1s with bonding energy of 284.6eV was used as reference. The formation of active phases in the catalysts was studied through temperature programmed reduction (TPR). A Micromeritics Auto Chem 2910 equipment was used to obtain the TPR profiles. In these analyses, a sample of 50mg of each solid was heated at 10K/min from 298 to 573K under 50mL/min of a 10% H2 in N2 mixture."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The catalytic tests in the hydrogenation of benzene (Sigma–Aldrich, 99%) were performed in a slurry Parr reactor at 373K, under 5MPa of H2 pressure and at a stirring speed of 1000rpm. These tests were conducted with 25mL of benzene, 30mL of distilled water and 5mL of n-heptane (Sigma–Aldrich, 99%) used as internal standard for the chromatographic method. The n-heptane was considered to be a compound suitable for our analytical purposes, because it is very soluble in the organic phase (where the reaction products are) and easily separated from the reaction products during the chromatographic analysis, besides being chemically inert under the reaction conditions. In the purpose of evaluating the influence of the quantity of additive on the catalytic performance, exploratory reactions were conducted with the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, prepared by wet impregnation. Such reactions were conducted adding to the reactional medium the quantities of 500ppm, 9mL or 30mL of each studied additive. In these experiments, the total volume of water and additive was kept constant and equal to 30mL (50% of the total reaction volume). Based on the obtained results (higher selectivity and activity), the adopted quantities of additive were the following: 9mL for ethyl acetate (EA), monoethyleneglycol (MEG), both from Merck, and n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) from Acros; 500ppm for monoethanolamine (MEA) and ethylenediamine (EDA), both from Merck. All additives were provided with at least 99% of purity. These additives were carefully selected, taking into consideration the fact that they are stable, both chemically as thermally, in the reaction conditions. Before the reaction, the catalysts were activated in situ for 45min at 373K under H2 atmosphere, with the intention of stabilizing the active phase of Ru, which may be partially oxidized due to the exposure of the catalyst to the atmospheric air. Samples of the organic phase were collected from the reaction medium during the reaction and analyzed on a HP 5890 series II gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 0.25mm×25m capillary column with dimethylsyloxane phase. Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze the aqueous phase in order to verify the chemical and physical stability of the additives. The analyses were conducted on a ThermoScientific NXR FT-Raman spectrometer using a 1064nm laser with 1.30W covering a 3700–200cm−1 range. First, a sample of the pure additive was placed on a capillary tube in order to determine its Raman scattering pattern. Then, samples taken from the reaction medium at determined time intervals (0, 10, 30, 60 and 120min) were analyzed and compared to one another, as well as to the pure additive pattern. The hydrogenation of benzene is a multiple step reaction, occurring both in series and in parallel. It can be visualized in Fig. 1 , where k is the kinetic constant of each reaction. The conversion of benzene (X) and yield of cyclohexene (R) were calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. The experimental values were used to adjust the graphic R vs. X according to the mass balance on the reactor. Thus, the yield of cyclohexene can be calculated according to the Eq. (3), where α is the relation k 2/k 1 and β is k 3/k 1. (1) X = mol of reacted benzene mol of initial benzene (2) R = mol of cyclohexene formed mol of initial benzene (3) R = 1 − X + β α 1 − X + β 1 + β α − 1 α 1 − α + β 1 + β − α 1 − α − β α In order to determine the initial reaction rate, the instantaneous reaction rate was calculated for each experimental point (concentration of benzene vs. reaction time). Through a linear fit of these rates, preferably for the values close to the beginning of the reaction, it was made an extrapolation of these values to zero reaction time."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Proton affinity of the supports and solids morphology,"3.1 Proton affinity of the supports and solids morphology The isoelectric point of the support is an essential parameter for the wet impregnation method, since both Al2O3 and CeO2 present an amphoteric behavior. The isoelectric point represents the pH in which the surface of the solid has a neutral charge. From the isoelectric point, higher values of pH favors the approach of positive charges, whereas lower values of pH favors the approach of negative charges. The Fig. 3 presents the proton affinity curves obtained for the supports Al2O3 and CeO2. According to Kosmulski [15], the isoelectric point of ceria is located between the pH of 6.8 and 8.6, whereas it is found between 8.0 and 9.0 to alumina. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the isoelectric point of the ceria is at a pH of 8.8, while it is near to a pH of 9.3 to the alumina. Therefore, it can be inferred that the ceria used in this work is slightly more acidic than the alumina. In addition, the isoelectric points obtained are in agreement with the Kosmulski values [15]. Hence, in order to obtain an efficient deposition of the metal on the catalyst surface, the suspension pH must be above its isoelectric point values. So, a suspension pH of 10 was adopted for both the supports and all the wet impregnation preparations. The Table 1 presents the specific surface areas of the solids. The IH abbreviation besides the catalysts denomination indicates that the solid was prepared by incipient impregnation and reduced under H2 flow. In contrast, WF indicates that the solid was prepared by wet impregnation and reduced with formaldehyde. As it can be seen in Table 1, the specific surface area of the supports and catalysts are very low. As observed by Rodrigues and Cobo [6], Ru catalysts with lower specific areas lead to higher cyclohexene yield. The addition of Ru to the support increases the specific surface area, mainly in the case of the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation (Ru/Al2O3-WF and Ru/CeO2-WF). This effect has also been observed by Kawi et al. [16], according to whom this is due to the formation of Ru(OH)3 during the preparation."
7,Elementary chemical composition of the solids,"3.2 Elementary chemical composition of the solids The elementary chemical composition of the solids, obtained through EDX analysis, is presented in Table 1. Despite of the semi-quantitative precision of the EDX technique, the results indicate that the Ru load on all catalysts is relatively near the desired amount (5wt%). Nevertheless, a higher amount of Ru is observed on the Ru/Al2O3-WF catalyst, which might indicate that wet impregnation leads to a more efficient incorporation of the metal on the support. This consideration is reinforced by the results of Bu et al. [8]. The results of EDX also revealed the absence of chlorine in all analyzed catalysts. The presence of chlorine may modify the hydrophilicity of ruthenium catalysts, thus having an important role in the liquid phase benzene hydrogenation [17]. This result indicates that the reduction treatment led to a significant removal of residual chlorine, present in the Ru precursor. However, the XPS technique allowed the evaluation of the relative amount of chlorine present in the surface of the catalysts. The atomic ratios obtained from this XPS analysis are shown in Table 1. For all the analyzed catalysts, the atomic ratio Cl/Ru is significantly lower than 3, which is the theoretical value for the precursor RuCl3. This result also suggests that that the reduction treatments are efficient on the removal the residual chlorine. Nevertheless, the Cl/Ru ratios on surface for the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation (Ru/Al2O3-WF and Ru/CeO2-WF) are considerably lower than for those prepared by incipient impregnation (Ru/Al2O3-IH and Ru/CeO2-IH). These results show that the wet impregnation, conducted at a pH higher than the isoelectric point of the support and coupled with formaldehyde as reduction agent, led to a lower amount of chlorine on the catalysts surface."
8,Particle size and dispersion of ruthenium,"3.3 Particle size and dispersion of ruthenium The catalysts Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/CeO2 were submitted to TEM analysis with the purpose of determining the mean particle size of Ru and, consequently, to evaluate the metallic dispersion. The Fig. 2 presents the TEM images obtained for the alumina support (a), the Ru/Al2O3-IH catalyst (b), and the Ru/Al2O3-WF catalyst (c). On the Fig. 2(b) the ruthenium particles on the catalyst prepared by incipient impregnation appears under the form of clusters, in contrast to what is observed on the catalyst prepared by wet impregnation (Fig. 2(c)), where the dispersion of ruthenium appears to be more uniform. The mean particle size of Ru determined for the Ru/Al2O3-WF catalyst (10nm) is significantly smaller than for the Ru/Al2O3-IH solid (21nm). In the case of the Ru/CeO2 catalysts a similar result was obtained. The mean particle size of Ru is smaller for the Ru/CeO2-WF catalyst (12nm) than for Ru/CeO2-IH (19nm). The Ru dispersion seems to be practically the same on both the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation (Ru/Al2O3-WF and Ru/CeO2-WF), as well as on both the catalysts prepared by incipient impregnation (Ru/Al2O3-IH and Ru/CeO2-IH). Therefore, the wet impregnation leads to a higher Ru dispersion than the incipient impregnation for both the supports Al2O3 and CeO2. These results are in accordance with what was observed by Bu et al. [8] for Ru/SiO2 catalysts."
9,Active phase formation,"3.4 Active phase formation Table 2 shows the H2 consumption and the temperatures at maximum of the unique peak in TPR profiles for the Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/CeO2 catalysts. The INR abbreviation beside the catalysts denomination represents the catalysts prepared by incipient impregnation and not reduced under H2 flow. Similarly, the WNR abbreviation stands for catalysts prepared by wet impregnation and not reduced with formaldehyde. As it can be seen, catalysts prepared by wet impregnation have H2 consumption peaks at much lower temperatures, when compared to catalysts prepared by incipient impregnation. Such behavior may be due to the formation of the Ru(OH)3 during the wet impregnation procedure, being the Ru(OH)3 more easily reducible than the precursor RuCl3. The catalysts prepared by incipient impregnation, which were not submitted to a reduction procedure (Ru/Al2O3-INR and Ru/CeO2-INR), present H2 consumptions near to stoichiometric values corresponding to the complete reduction of RuCl3 (15μmol H2/mg Ru). Due to the nature of CeO2, the Ru/CeO2-INR catalyst may also present the reduction of the support itself, leading to a higher H2 consumption in comparison to Ru/Al2O3-INR. On the contrary, catalysts prepared by wet impregnation and not reduced with formaldehyde (Ru/Al2O3-WNR and Ru/CeO2-WNR) present H2 consumptions lower than the stoichiometric value for complete reduction of Ru(OH)3 (15μmol H2/mg Ru). This result might be due to the existence of lower hydroxyl/Ru proportions. It can also be observed that the catalysts reduced before the TPR analysis (abbreviations IH and WF) present H2 consumptions different than zero, indicating that the metal might have suffered a partial oxidation during the exposure of the catalyst to the atmospheric air. The H2 consumptions of the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation (Ru/Al2O3-WF and Ru/CeO2-WF) are significantly higher than the respective consumption of the catalysts prepared by incipient impregnation (Ru/Al2O3-IH and Ru/CeO2-IH). Such result might be an indication that the wet impregnation method leads to a higher dispersion of Ru and, therefore, a higher amount of the metal is exposed to the atmospheric air."
10,Catalytic performance on the partial hydrogenation of benzene,"3.5 Catalytic performance on the partial hydrogenation of benzene 3.5.1 Effects of the preparation method In order to evaluate the influence of the preparation method on the performance of Ru catalysts, the solids prepared by incipient impregnation and reduced under H2, as well as those prepared by wet impregnation and reduced by formaldehyde, were tested on the partial hydrogenation of benzene. The Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the yield of cyclohexene during the reaction course (benzene conversion) for Ru/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by both the impregnation methods investigated. In this figure there is also a catalyst prepared by wet impregnation that was not reduced by formaldehyde, but under H2 flow, employing the same procedure of the incipient impregnation method. This solid was prepared with the purpose of evaluating the influence of the reduction agent on the catalytic performance. As it can be seen in Fig. 4, the Ru/Al2O3-WH catalyst leads to the lowest cyclohexene yield. The Ru/Al2O3-IH catalyst leads to a modest cyclohexene yield, whereas the Ru/Al2O3-WF catalyst leads to the highest yields of cyclohexene for benzene conversions up to 70%. These results reveal an evident influence of the impregnation method and of the reduction agent on the performance of Ru/Al2O3 catalysts. Suryawanshi and Mahajani [7], using Ru/Al2O3 catalysts without any additive in the reaction medium, obtained results similar to this work concerning the maximum yield of cyclohexene, however to lower conversions of benzene. Bu et al. [8] also reported the same behavior observed in Fig. 4, for Ru/SBA-15 catalysts. According to these authors [8], the highest yields of cyclohexene, observed in the presence of catalysts prepared by wet impregnation, can be related to the formation of ruthenium crystallites lower than 10nm. In its turn, the Ru/CeO2, independently of the preparation method, presented similar behavior on the reaction. Its performance was also inferior than the observed for Ru/Al2O3 catalysts. The Table 3 presents the values of initial reaction rate (r 0), maximum yield of cyclohexene (R max) and conversion of benzene (X max) obtained for the Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/CeO2 catalysts. The activity of the Ru/Al2O3-WF catalyst is much higher than that obtained for the Ru/Al2O3-IH catalyst. The XPS analysis revealed a significant dechlorination on the surface of Ru/Al2O3-WF, whereas to Ru/Al2O3-IH the amount of chlorine is relatively higher. It was proposed that residual chlorine may occupy active sites on the catalyst surface. Also, the increase in the reaction rate may be related to the higher metal dispersion on the surface of the catalysts. Bu et al. [8] also obtained higher activities for benzene hydrogenation with Ru/SiO2 catalysts prepared by wet impregnation, what was attributed by the authors to the higher dispersion of metal observed by TEM. In the present study, the results of TEM also indicate that the metal dispersion on the catalyst prepared by wet impregnation (Ru/Al2O3-WF) is significantly higher than on the solid prepared by incipient impregnation (Ru/Al2O3-IH). As for the Ru/Al2O3-WH and Ru/Al2O3-WF catalysts, one can observe that the activity of the catalyst reduced by formaldehyde was almost twice as high. This observation may be due to the interaction between formaldehyde and Ru during its preparation. As a result, Ru/Al2O3-WF presents a more suitable performance, leading to a higher cyclohexene yield on an also higher benzene conversion. This result is also important for catalysts that may not be submitted to high reduction temperatures due to coalescence phenomenon. In this sense, a milder condition of metal reduction, coupled with the right reducing agent, can be applied without any loss of activity or perhaps even an increase on its performance. Alternatively, the catalytic activity behavior change completely for the catalysts supported on ceria. In this case, the Ru/CeO2-WF catalyst is the less active, followed by Ru/CeO2-IH and Ru/CeO2-WH. Thus, for the CeO2 support, the reduction under H2 leads to Ru/CeO2 catalysts more actives than the reduction by formaldehyde. Therefore, the results show that the influence of the method of preparation on the activity of Ru catalysts is highly dependent on the support nature. As it can still be seen in Table 3 data, the reduction by formaldehyde leads to highest values to the maximum yield of cyclohexene and catalytic activity for the solids supported on alumina. In the case of the catalysts supported on ceria, the reduction under H2 increase the catalytic activity, although the maximum yield of cyclohexene decrease with respect to the catalyst Ru/CeO2-WF reduced by formaldehyde. Through TPR analysis, it looks like that the reduction under H2 or by formaldehyde may have not completely reduced all the content of ruthenium precursor. However, the presence of ruthenium in different oxidation states may be favorable for the formation of the active sites on the solid. Since the catalysts Ru/Al2O3-WH and Ru/CeO2-WH prepared by the wet impregnation method and reduced by H2 did not present better results in terms of selectivity, they were not used for the study about the influence of organic additives in the reaction medium. 3.5.2 Effects of additives in the reaction medium Organic compounds were added to the reaction medium in order to investigate its influence on the performance of catalysts for the partial hydrogenation of benzene. While the presence of water is paramount for obtaining elevated yields of cyclohexene [4], the presence of liquid additives may be a valuable alternative to the use of inorganic salts, which increase the selectivity but may cause fouling on industrial equipments [7]. In the present work, the additives ethylenediamine (EDA), ethyl acetate (EA), n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), monoethyleneglycol (MEG) and monoethanolamine (MEA) were employed. Fan et al. [11] used EDA as an additive on a medium that already had ZnSO4 and obtained interesting yields of cyclohexene. Ethyl acetate is highly soluble in benzene, which could lead to higher initial rates and is also a very common compound for the azeotropic distillation of close boiling point mixtures. The use of NMP is recommended by Kanda et al. [18], as a suitable organic compound for the separation of the benzene–cyclohexene–cyclohexane mixture, which is formed during this reaction. Due to the low relative volatility of this mixture, an extractive distillation is required. Thus, an investigation of its use as additive could lead to an integration of reaction and distillation processes. MEG is a well-known additive used for the partial hydrogenation of benzene, in part because of its oxygen which bonds with the ruthenium and enhances the yield of cyclohexene [12]. MEA, as well as monoethyleneglycol, was already studied by many researchers [7,11] as an additive to the partial hydrogenation of benzene. The addition of EDA to the medium, for instance, leads to a strong deactivation of the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, even with a small amount of additive (500ppm). In this case, the reaction became extremely slow, without any increase in selectivity. Based on these results, it can be proposed that molecules containing N atoms, such as EDA and MEA may bond to more than one active site, thus blocking the planar adsorption of benzene and leading to lower activities. Hence, our suggestion is that the catalytic activity is inversely proportional to this interaction. A modest increase on the yield of cyclohexene was observed with the addition of EA in the reaction medium, compared to the situation of absence of additives. An increase of activity with the Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/CeO2 catalysts may be related to a higher solubility of benzene in EA than in water. However, the catalytic performance was particularly worse than those observed for the additives NMP, MEG and MEA. In Table 4 , it is presented a comparison between the catalytic performances in presence of the most efficient additives. The analysis of Table 4 reveals that the presence of NMP decreases the activity of the catalysts prepared from wet impregnation Ru/Al2O3-WF and Ru/CeO2-WF. In contrast, the addition of NMP leads to a moderate activity increase for the solids obtained by wet impregnation Ru/Al2O3-IH and Ru/CeO2-IH. Therefore, one can infer that the interaction between NMP and the catalysts depends on their preparation method. A higher metallic dispersion, coupled with the low amount of chlorine on the surface of catalysts, may lead to a more pronounced additive-catalyst interaction, thus blocking some active sites and leading to the decrease of its activity. Another interpretation for the decrease of the catalytic activity can be made considering a decrease in the mass transfer in presence of the additive. The NMP is miscible in water but benzene is not soluble in this additive. Therefore, the compound may be acting as a barrier, preventing benzene adsorption on the catalysts. An analysis of the obtained values of the rate constants, which are also related to the mass transfer, indicates that the direct hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane and the hydrogenation of cyclohexene are both suppressed in presence of this additive, thus leading to lower catalyst activity. On the other hand, the addition of both MEG and MEA decreases significantly the activity of both Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/CeO2 catalysts. As stated before, the nitrogen on the MEA molecule may interact with more than one active site, thus blocking the benzene adsorption. MEG molecules contain oxygen atoms that could have the same part on the additive–solid interaction. In addition, benzene is not completely soluble on MEG or MEA. Thus, mass transfer limitations are also to be considered. According to the results, one can observe that the presence of the additives NMP, MEG and MEA increase of the maximum yield of cyclohexene to all Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/CeO2 tested catalysts. The promoter effect of MEG on the selectivity is in agreement with the work of Spinacé and Vaz [12]. According to these authors, the higher yields of cyclohexene, observed with the addition of MEG, may be explained by the structure of the metal–additive interaction. The MEG molecules have no hydrophobic groups and its hydroxyl groups interact with the surrounding water molecules. Thus, it will form hydrated organic molecules and the presence of this additive may enhance the hydrophilicity around the ruthenium particles, increasing the yield of cyclohexene. This observation is in agreement with Fan et al. [11], for whom MEG interacts with Ru sites, forming a water layer around the active metal centers, thus being crucial for the higher yields observed with this additive. Since the cyclohexene is highly insoluble on water, this layer departs the intermediate from the solid, avoiding its undesirable hydrogenation. The promoter effect of MEA on the selectivity is remarkable, even with a small amount of this additive (500ppm), compared to the higher amount of NMP and MEG added to the medium (9mL). The yield increase is particularly the highest (16%) in presence of MEA for the Ru/Al2O3-WF catalyst prepared by wet impregnation. Whereas it enhances the yield of cyclohexene, its presence on the reaction medium decreased considerably the activity for all studied catalysts. This observation is in agreement with the study of Suryawanshi and Mahajani [7], which indicates that catalysts supported on alumina lead to better catalytic results in the presence of MEA. According to these authors and Fan et al. [11], the pre-adsorption of organic amines on the surface of ruthenium could enhance the selectivity to cyclohexene. The formation of hydrogen bonds between cyclohexene and MEA may weaken the overlap of π-electrons of the CC double bond in cyclohexene molecule with the d-orbital of Ru, thus favoring the desorption of cyclohexene and improving the selectivity. Fan at al. [11] suggests that due to the interaction between organic additives and ruthenium, the electron transfer from N atoms (from amines) or O (from alcohols) to the d orbital of ruthenium probably occurs and makes ruthenium become an electron-enriched center, also favoring the desorption of cyclohexene. As postulated by Struijk et al. [19], a stagnant film of water on the hydrophilic catalyst surface form a barrier for the adsorption of both reactants hydrogen and benzene. The addition of hydrophilic compounds to the reaction medium, such as MEG and MEA, may cause changes in this barrier. However, effects induced by the additive on the reactant–catalyst or product–catalyst interaction should not be disregarded. Therefore, the effects of organic additives on the reaction medium of the partial hydrogenation of benzene should be explained from both points of view: interaction between additive and catalyst and also between the additive and the stagnant water film. In order to evaluate the reuse of additives NMP, MEG and MEA, the reaction medium was analyzed by means of Raman spectroscopy. During all the reaction no transformation (degradation, decomposition or consumption) was observed for these additives. Alternatively, the MEA concentration in the reaction medium was too low to enable a proper analysis. Additionally, according to the Material Safety Data Sheet to NMP, MEG and MEA (provided by the manufacturer), the boiling points of these compounds are 475K, 469K and 443K, respectively. Since the compounds benzene, cyclohexene and cyclohexane have boiling points around 353K, the additives are easily separated from the reaction medium via conventional distillation. Hence, these results indicate that the additives NMP, MEG and MEA can be separated from the reaction medium and reused by recycle to the reactor. The Fig. 5 presents the evolution of the yield during the reaction to the Ru/Al2O3-WF catalyst in presence of additives in the reaction medium. This catalyst presented the best performance for the partial hydrogenation of benzene, leading to the highest values of activity and selectivity. One can observe that, among the studied additives, MEA leads to the highest yields of cyclohexene, practically during all the reaction. Nevertheless, a study about the extractive distillation of the reaction products, to be published, revealed that the MEA additive is not an adequate separation agent for the benzene–cyclohexene–cyclohexane mixture. It was found that the MEG additive presents excellent efficiency for this separation, along with the effect observed in this work regarding the significant increase in yield of cyclohexene."
11,Conclusions,"Under the conditions employed for the present study, regarding the partial hydrogenation of benzene in liquid phase, the impregnation methods induce remarkable effects on the catalytic performance of Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/CeO2. While on Ru/CeO2 the effects are not evident, on Ru/Al2O3 the wet impregnation method with formaldehyde as the reducing agent lead to the more active and selective catalyst of this study. The addition of organic compounds to the reaction medium may have different effects on the selectivity of the catalyst, depending on the nature of the additive and the impregnation method. The cyclohexene yield increases in presence of additive compounds in the reaction medium, according to the order: monoethanolamine>monoethyleneglycol>n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone≫ethyl acetate>without additive≫ethylenediamine, whereas the catalytic activity followed the order: ethyl acetate>without additive>n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone>monoethyleneglycol>monoethanolamine ≫ethylenediamine."
