0,Introduction,"As an energy carrier with extremely low environmental pollution, hydrogen can be used to generate electricity by fuel cells or as an energy storage carrier. Among various hydrogen production methods, photocatalytic hydrogen production is the most promising way [1]. Generally, the efficiency of single physical-field catalysis is relatively low. The photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency is about 1% for overall water splitting [2]. Therefore, to further improve the performance of photocatalysis, more and more studies have combined photocatalysis with the other physical-field, such as piezoelectric effect [3–6], pyroelectric effect [7–9], friction electrification [10], internal electric fields [11], etc. The piezoelectric effect refers to materials with a non-centrosymmetric structure whose positive and negative charge centers can be separated under the mechanical deformation or an external electric field, thereby generating piezoelectric potential [12]. Z. Wang et al. firstly demonstrated the piezoelectric effect on the responsivity of a metal-semiconductor-metal ZnO micro-/nanowire photodetector [13]. Shi et al. further studied that a heterogeneous semiconductor interface's barrier height could be adjusted by piezoelectric polarization. They found that a consistent enhancement or reduction of photocurrent was observed when tensile or compressive strains were applied to the ZnO anode, respectively [14]. If the material is affected by tensile stress, its piezoelectric effectiveness would be improved. The changes in Schottky barrier heights were also observed in two-dimensional MoS2 [15]. Jia et al. have systematically studied contaminants' degradation by piezoelectric catalysis in coordination with photocatalysis [16–20]. The piezoelectric effect generated by ultrasonic cavitation was proved to degrade methyl orange and rhodamine B efficiently. The mechanism is that tiny cavitation bubbles bursting under the high-frequency ultrasonic vibration would hit the nanoparticles' surface resulting in the piezoelectric effect. Chen et al. prepared the BaTiO3/C hybrid nanocomposites for strong piezoelectric-catalysis of dye wastewater decomposition by a two-step hydrothermal method [21]. It was found that the doping of C elements in the piezoelectric materials could help to accelerate the charge transfer and improve the piezoelectric catalytic efficiency. ZnO, MoS2, niobates, titanates, and tungstate materials are the representative piezoelectric materials [22–26]. Because these materials exhibit noticeable piezoelectric effects, they are potential candidates for applying piezoelectric polarization to adjust the heterogeneous semiconductor interface's barrier height. Among these piezoelectric materials, SrTiO3 has been one of the most widely studied oxide semiconductors with low cost and high stability [27–30]. Also, STO is a cubic perovskite-type composite oxide with a high dielectric constant and constant refractive, showing significant piezoelectric and thermoelectric properties [31–37]. Although photovoltaic properties of SrTiO3 have been widely studied, few studies have explored the coupling of the piezoelectric effect and the heterogeneous photocatalytic hydrogen production. This study synthesized cubic STO nanoparticles through the solid-state reaction method and studied their piezoelectric effect on heterogeneous photocatalytic hydrogen production."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All the starting materials were analytical grades and were used without further purification. SrCO3 and methanol were purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. And P25 was a highly dispersed gas phase nano-scale titanium dioxide produced by DEGUSSA."
3,Synthesis of STO,"2.2 Synthesis of STO STO was prepared by the one-step solid-phase method referring to previous works [38]. Firstly, 0.3 g P25 and 0.56 g SrCO3 were mixed well. The mixed powder was then transferred to alumina crucible and heated to 800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C, and 1100 °C for 6 h, respectively. After natural cooling, the white products were acquired, named STO-X (X = 800, 900, 1000, and 1100)."
4,Photocatalytic H2 production,"2.3 Photocatalytic H2 production The photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. Firstly, 100 mg STO-X was dispersed in 50 mL aqueous solution containing methanol (CH3OH; 10 mL) in a Pyrex reaction cell. H2PtCl6 solution (0.004 g/mL) containing 1 mg Pt was added to the above-mixed solution. Then, the suspension was ultrasonically dispersed and thoroughly degassed before irradiation by Xe lamp. The amount of H2 was analyzed using online gas chromatography. The above steps were repeated for the ultrasonic test, and one or two ultrasonic vibrating rods (60 W, 45 kHz) were put in the condensing pool. All hydrogen evolution tests were carried out for 3 h, with one point measured every half hour. After that, the sediment was filtered and dried at 353 K in the air for 12 h. The products recycled under light (photocatalysis) were named STO-X-P, and the products recycled under light and ultrasound (sonophotocatalysis) were named STO-X-SP."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by D8 Advance Davinci (Bruker) with a Cu Kα X-ray radiation source. The obtained morphology was investigated by transmission electronic micrograph (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100F). The XPS patterns were measured as an electronic energy spectrum by Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos at 300 W using Mg Kα X-rays as the excitation source. Samples as prepared were directly fixed on the test stand by double side tape. The binding energies (B.E.) of the elements were calibrated relative to the carbon impurity with a C1s at 284.8 eV. Raman test was carried out under Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM with a 532 nm laser excitation."
6,Results and discussion,"XRD patterns of as-prepared STO-X were shown in Fig. 1. The diffraction peaks at 22.78°, 32.4°, 40.0°, 46.48, 52.4°, 57.8°, 67.8°, and 77.2° were indexed to (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (310) crystal faces of the SrTiO3 (JCPDS 35–0734) [39]. The diffraction peaks at 25.3°, 26.0°, 36.4°, and 44.3° corresponded to SrCO3. Thus, there was a small amount of SrCO3 impurities in STO-800. When the calcination temperature was above 900 ºC, pure SrTiO3 could be obtained. The average grain sizes of STO-800, STO-900, STO-1000, and STO-1100 were further estimated by the Scherle formula to be 40.5 nm, 45.6 nm, 46.2 nm, and 47.7 nm, respectively. The Raman spectra of STO-X were further given in Fig. 2(a) to confirm the crystal structure. Due to the cubic perovskite structure of SrTiO3, all first-order Raman scattering lines are primarily not allowed. Thus, the Raman spectrum would be dominated by the second-order activity [40]. Fig. 2(a) showed that the spectra of STO-X nanoparticles display broad bands at around 250–500 and 600–800 cm-1 regions related to the second-order Raman. Remarkably, the sharp peak at 152 cm−1 was significantly weakened with the calcination temperature increased. The sharp peak was associated with the first-order Raman scattering in STO nanoparticles caused by the local symmetry distortions. It is known that non-centrosymmetric domains in the STO nanocrystals would cause a sizeable intrinsic polarization effect [41]. The Raman spectra of STO-900 recycled under photocatalysis (STO-900-P) and sonophotocatalysis (STO-900-SP) were given in Fig. 2(b). There were no changes after the reaction that the two second-order broad bands and the sharp peak at 152 cm−1 still existed. The surface chemical bonding between the component elements was studied by XPS, as shown in Fig. 2(c)–(f). The binding energies (B.E.) of the elements were calibrated by C1s at 284.8 eV relative to the carbon impurity. Fig. 2(d) showed that two binding energy peaks at 458.3 and 464.1 eV were matched to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 3p1/2, demonstrating Ti4+ state existed in STO. Additionally, a low-energy shoulder at 457.0 eV in the Ti 2p spectrum was detected, which is the characteristic feature for Ti3+ ions [42]. From the high-resolution O 1s in Fig. 2(e), two peaks at 529.1 eV and 531.2 eV were observed, resulting from the lattice oxygen, surface oxygen on the surface of STO nanocrystals. The peak intensity at 531.2 eV was primarily related to the oxygen vacancies concentration [36]. Thus, STO-900 was prepared with rich defects on its surface, generating powerful polarization effects under ultrasonic vibration. From the high-resolution Pt 4f of STO-900-P and STO-900-SP2, two prominent peaks were observed at 70.6 and 74.4 eV, referring to metallic Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2. The relative content of Pt loaded on the surface was about 0.94% and 0.91% for STO-900-P and STO-900-SP2, respectively. Thus, it was concluded that no difference was made to the Pt chemical valence after introducing ultrasound. The H2 production activities of P25 and STO-X under the different conditions were given in Fig. 3. P25 without piezoelectric effect produced almost the same amount of hydrogen by photocatalysis and sonophotocatalysis. It was speculated that STO-800 might show nearly no piezoelectric effect because of a certain SrCO3 covering on the surface. Due to the best crystallinity with fewer defects, STO-1100 might also have no piezoelectric effect. Fig. 3(b) shows that STO-900 achieved the best photocatalytic performance than STO-800, STO-1000, and STO-1100. When introducing the ultrasonic cavitation, the H2 production of STO-800 and STO-1100 hardly changed. However, hydrogen production of STO-900 and STO-1000 significantly decreased under sonophotocatalysis. Remarkably, with the increase of ultrasound power, the activity decreased. Generally, ultrasonic cavitation is beneficial for heterogeneous catalysis. Photocatalytic pure water splitting by STO-900 was conducted to prove this facilitation of ultrasonic cavitation, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Both the hydrogen and oxygen production was almost doubled under sonophotocatalysis. It is known that oxygen solubility is more considerable than hydrogen solubility. The dissolved oxygen would further cause hydrogen and oxygen recombination. So the reason for performance improvement in pure water might be due to the quick oxygen evolution by ultrasonic cavitation. Thus, ultrasonic cavitation had a different influence on the photocatalytic hydrogen production of STO with or without sacrificial agents. To investigate why the hydrogen production decreased under sonophotocatalysis with sacrificial agents, we further explored the photocatalytic hydrogen production of STO-900 with lactic acid, alcohol, and methanol as sacrificial agents, as shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that STO-900 had the most photocatalytic hydrogen production with lactic acid as a sacrificial agent. When introducing the ultrasonic cavitation, the hydrogen production changed significantly with different sacrificial agents. Firstly, ultrasound had almost no effect on the hydrogen production of STO-900 with lactic acid as a sacrificial agent. Then, the downward trend of the hydrogen production with methanol as a sacrificial agent was more evident than that with alcohol as a sacrificial agent. We speculated that it was caused by the different viscosity of the three sacrificial agents. Lactic acid had the highest viscosity, followed by methanol and alcohol. The higher the viscosity, the weaker the cavitation produced by the ultrasonic wave. Therefore, ultrasonic cavitation had a different effect on photocatalytic hydrogen production with different sacrificial agents. It was undoubtedly that the decreasing hydrogen production with sacrificial agents under sonophotocatalysis was caused by ultrasonic cavitation. The photocatalytic hydrogen production of STO-900 with the different positions of the ultrasonic vibrators was shown in Fig. 5. It can easily be seen that different ultrasonic vibrators' positions had a great influence on the performance. The different positions of the ultrasonic vibrators would result in different ultrasonic cavitation. If two ultrasonic vibrators were positioned at a cross of 90 degrees, it was equivalent to the hydrogen production under light conditions only. When two ultrasonic vibrators were mounted on the same side, the hydrogen production was close to that of an ultrasonic vibrator. Finally, when two ultrasonic vibrators were placed facing each other, the hydrogen production was the least. The reason for this might be that wave cancellation occurred with different positions of ultrasonic vibrators. Since ultrasound waves were generated by the vibration of the vibrator, they could spread in all directions from the vibrating rod. Therefore, ultrasonic waves with the same frequency and power may overlap or even cancel out in a reaction cell with multiple ultrasonic vibrators. Ultrasonic cavitation would cause the piezoelectric effect, which generally accelerates the catalytic reaction. However, the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of STO was weakened by the ultrasonic cavitation in our study. Thus, we speculated that the piezoelectric effect caused by ultrasonic cavitation in STO had a negative impact on photocatalytic hydrogen production. Shi et al. have found that the ZnO photoelectrode interface potential and energy band structure would change under the control of pressure and tension stress [14]. The changed energy band caused by the piezoelectric effect would further affect the reaction efficiency. Particularly, the reaction efficiency would decrease when pressure stress acted on the material. Therefore, pressure stress produced by ultrasonic cavitation would build a piezoelectric potential on the surface of STO. This piezoelectric potential would inhibit photo-generated carriers migrating to the surface. To verify the speculation, HRTEM was further used to study Pt nanoparticles' morphology loading on the STO by in-situ deposition, as shown in Fig. 6. The distribution of Pt nanoparticles was more uniform under photocatalysis than that under sonophotocatalysis. Additionally, Pt nanoparticles aggregated obviously on the surface of STO nanoparticles by ultrasonic cavitation. The possible mechanism for the weakened photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of STO by sonophotocatalysis was proposed, as shown in Fig. 7. Ultrasonic cavitation would hit the surface of STO to generate the local surface piezoelectric potential. This potential would prevent photoinduced electrons from migrating to the surface. Thus, the hydrogen production would decrease under sonophotocatalysis with sacrificial agents."
7,Conclusions,"SrTiO3 with perovskite structure was successfully obtained by the solid-phase method under different calcination temperatures. The STO nanoparticles synthesized at 900 °C had the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. The photocatalytic hydrogen production test found that the piezoelectric effect led by the ultrasonic cavitation had a different influence on heterogeneous photocatalytic hydrogen production with or without sacrificial agents. Additionally, the sacrificial agents with the different viscosity and positions of the ultrasonic vibrators also affected the sonophotocatalytic hydrogen production of STO. By in situ photocatalysis and sonophotocatalysis deposition Pt nanoparticles, it was found that Pt nanoparticles preferred to aggregate on the local surface of STO nanoparticles by the ultrasonic cavitation. It was explained that a piezoelectric potential on the local surface of STO would be built by the ultrasonic cavitation. This piezoelectric potential would further inhibit photo-generated carriers migrating to the surface. Thus, sonophotocatalysis was unfavorable for hydrogen production by SrTiO3."
