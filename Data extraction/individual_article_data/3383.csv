0,Introduction,"The literature defines ionic liquids (ILs) as salts, which have a melting point below 100 °C whereas room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL) are salts that are liquids at room temperature. Many of these compounds have good solubility in organic and inorganic solvents, low volatility, good chemical and thermal stability and are normally recyclable. Ionic liquids are divided into aprotic ionic liquids (AILs) and protic ionic liquids (PILs). The ILs belonging to this last subclass are prepared by a simple neutralization reaction through a 1:1 combination of a Brønsted acid and a Brønsted base [1,2]. Ionic liquids have been used in chemical synthesis, extraction, catalysis, nanomaterials, batteries, corrosion inhibitors, lubricants, additives, among other applications [3–5]. In particular, PILs have found applications in fuel cells, biomass pretreatment, methane hydrate inhibition and carbon dioxide capture [6–9]. Although thermodynamic properties of binary systems containing AILs, mainly consisting of imidazolium, pyridinium, phosphonium, and pyrrolidinium, have been extensively studied, similar studies containing PILs are scarcer [10]. The ammonium-based ILs (PILs) produced by acid-base neutralization between an amine and an acid have attracted attention due to their unique features such as catalytic effects, besides other advantages, e.g. easy preparation, low cost and low toxicity [11,12]. To extend their applications, it is undoubtedly necessary to study thermodynamic properties of systems containing PILs with other compounds, for example alcohols, which are widely explored in the industry as solvents. Some studies involving thermodynamic properties of binary systems containing ionic liquids with alcohols can be found in Xu et al. [11], Domańska et al. [13], González et al. [14], García-Mardones et al. [15], Kurnia et al. [16], Kurnia et al. [17], Wang et al. [18], Calvar et al. [19], Xu et al. [20], Rilo et al. [21], Qian et al. [22], Singh et al. [23], Domańska et al. [24], Requejo et al. [25], Zhang et al. [26], Lu et al. [27] and Reddy et al. [28]. Recent studies related to the ionic liquid n-butylammonium methanoate (N4Met) involve analytical use as separation media [29] and application in coir fibre treatment for bioethanol production [30]. There are also physical properties of the IL with measurements of density, viscosity, conductivity, dielectric relaxation spectra and local polarity of many alkylammonium formate ionic liquids including n-butylammonium methanoate [31], [32]. For the purpose of continuing to study interactions of protic ionic liquids and alcohols through thermodynamics and spectroscopic properties [33–35], in this work, n-butylammonium methanoate (N4Met) was synthesized and characterized by using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FTIR spectroscopy techniques. Furthermore, experimental data of density, speed of sound and viscosity for binary mixtures of {N4Met + ethanol, or +1-propanol, or +1-butanol, or +1-pentanol} were measured in the whole composition range at different temperatures T = (293.15–313.15) K under atmospheric pressure (p = 92.3 kPa). The industrial importance and the presence of hydroxyl groups which can carry out hydrogen bonds with the ionic liquid were the reasons for the selection of the alcohols as molecular solvents present in the mixtures. The alcohols were selected to analyse the growth of the carbonic chain on the properties of mixtures. From the experimental results, volumetric properties (excess molar volume, V m E , partial molar volume, V ¯ i , apparent molar volume, V ϕ i , excess partial molar volumes, V ¯ i E , and their infinite dilution, V ¯ i ∞ ), deviation in isentropic compressibility, Δ κ S , deviation in viscosity, Δη, and excess Gibbs energy of activation of viscous flow, Δ G *E , were calculated. These mixture and excess properties were analyzed in terms of possible intermolecular interactions between the chemical species present in the binary mixtures and structural effects, and complemented by a spectroscopic study. Moreover, viscosity values obtained experimentally were used to test the correlation of Grünberg-Nissan, Heric-Brewer, Van der Wyk and Katti-Chaudhary in order to determine their interaction parameters and to predict the behaviour of viscosity."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Methanoic acid (Merck, mass fraction purity ≥ 0.993), n-butylamine (Merck, mass fraction purity ≥ 0.999), ethanol (Merck, mass fraction purity ≥ 0.999), 1-propanol (Merck, mass fraction purity ≥ 0.995), 1-butanol (Merck, mass fraction purity ≥ 0.995) and 1-pentanol (Sigma-Aldrich, mass fraction purity ≥ 0.996) used in this study did not undergo any further purification. These purities are given on the water-free basis. The purity and other specifications of the pure compounds are summarized in Table 1 . The experimental data for density, speed of sound and viscosity of pure components were compared with corresponding values found in the literature at different temperatures (Table 2 and Figs. 1 and 2 ). An explanation for the significant difference between the experimental values and those found in the literature can be attributed to several effects such as purity of the components, water content and different techniques for experimental measurements. It is noticeable that differences among N4Met viscosity values (Fig. 2) are much greater than density values (Fig. 1), once water content heavily affects that first property. Wei et al. [36] synthesized N4Met with a final water concentration less than 0.06%, whose viscosity relative deviations are the smallest, which means that they are closer to our experimental data. The authors used an Oswald Viscometer with capillaries balls controlled by a Peltier thermostat. For Greaves et al. [37], the water content was higher (0.32%) as they used a Carri-Ned CSL2 100 Controlled Stress Rheometer TA Instrument to determine the viscosity values. Finally, Berthod et al. [38] used a Cannon-Fenske Viscometer immersed in constant temperature bath (Cannon Instrument Co.) and the water content was 0.73%. The experimental data from Berthod et al. presented the highest viscosity deviation in relation to our experimental results. The ionic liquid N4Met was synthesized in our laboratory by neutralization, dripping methanoic acid on n-butylamine under stirring and controllable condition, i.e. temperature range between 293.15 and 303.15 K, according to the methodology previously described in the literature [68]. Its characterization by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FTIR spectroscopy techniques was carried out as described by Neto et al. [30] and presented a purity of more than 99.7%. A Karl Fischer titration was used to determine the water content in the IL. The amount was less than 0.3198% w/w. The N4Met was not dried in high vacuum, because it generates amide and then its purity decreases [31]. Fig. 3 shows molecular structures of the synthesized N4Met and its reactants. An Advance III 600 HD Bruker spectrometer has been used to analyse 1H NMR (operating at 600 MHz) and 13C NMR (operating at 150 MHz). Deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) has been used as a solvent with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as standard. A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Nicolet with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) (Model 6700) has been used to obtain IR Spectra. The analyses were performed in the wavenumber (4000 – 450) cm−1 using 32 scans per spectrum resolution of 4 cm−1. The water content for the ionic liquid was analyzed by Karl Fischer titration (Mettler DL 18 Karl Fischer Titrator). On analysing the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of N4Met and comparing them with the initial reactants (Figs. S1–S6), it is clear that the chemical shift of the amino group from n-butylamine (0.92 × 10−6) changed after the formation of the n-butylammonium ion (7.86 ppm). This occurs due to the protonation of the amino group and the altered multiplicity of the hydrogen sign of the amine. Integration of hydrogens into the amine and the evidence of the attainment of the IL were confirmed by the presence of two and three hydrogen signals in the spectra [30]. The integrated signal of the amino group in the 1H NMR spectrum was also altered, indicating the presence of three hydrogens in the IL. The signal of the carbonyl group at 169.28 × 10−6 represents an offset due to the formation of the anion [11,20,30,69,70]. On analysis of the FTIR spectrum of N4Met (Fig. S7), the peak position of the CO band is intense and large situated approximately 1574 cm−1, which would be above 1600 cm−1 if it were an actual carboxylic acid. However, this happens because of its likely conjugation so that the anion owns a greater simple bonding characteristic. For the cation NH3 +, the peaks position can be located at (3250–2500) cm−1 since there are three hydrogens available, containing an intermediate intensity. The C-N bonds showed a low and intermediate intensity over (1500–1250) cm−1."
3,Apparatus and procedures,"2.2 Apparatus and procedures A commercial density and speed of sound analyser manufactured by Anton Paar (Model DSA 5000) and operating at a frequency of 3 MHz has been used to measure the densities and speeds of sound of pure components and their solutions. The uncertainty in the density and speed of sound measurements were ±1 × 10−3 g·cm−3 and 1.3 m.s−1, respectively. The Peltier device of the equipment made it possible to automatically keep the temperature constant at ±0.01 K. A rotational viscometer/densimeter manufactured by Anton Paar (Model Stabinger SVM 3000) was used to measure the viscosities of pure components and their solutions. The reproducibility in the viscosity measurements was ±0.35% and in the temperature measurements was ±0.02 K. The uncertainty in the viscosity measurements was 5%, which was calculated through a statistical analysis of the experimental data for each synthesis, including the impurity. The binary mixtures in different compositions were prepared by weighing the pure components using a digital electronic analytical balance (Model AUY220, Shimadzu) with precision of ±0.0001 g. To avoid evaporation of alcohols or absorption of water by the ionic liquid, all the solutions were prepared in 10 cm3 stoppered glass bottles inside a glovebox with an inert atmosphere. The uncertainty in mole fraction was estimated to be ±0.001."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Thermodynamic properties,"3.1 Thermodynamic properties Table 3 presents the experimental results for density, speed of sound, viscosities, excess molar volume, deviations in isentropic compressibility and in viscosity, excess Gibbs energy of activation of viscous flow for the binary systems studied at different temperatures. Variation of density, viscosity and speed of sound with the composition at different temperatures can be seen in Figs. S8–S19. Their values rise with the increase of N4Met molar fraction and decrease with the increase in temperature. The excess molar volume ( V m E ) was calculated using the following equation: (1) V m E = x 1 M 1 1 ρ - 1 ρ 1 + x 2 M 2 1 ρ - 1 ρ 2 , in which xi , Mi and ρi represent the mole fraction, molar masses, and densities of the pure components, respectively, and ρ is the density of liquid solution. The isentropic compressibility ( κ S ) was calculated using the following equation [71]: (2) κ S = 1 ρ · u 2 , in which ρ and u represent the density and speed of sound. The deviations in isentropic compressibility ( Δ κ S ) were calculated using the following equation: (3) Δ κ S = 1 ρ · u 2 - x 1 1 ρ 1 · u 1 2 + x 2 1 ρ 2 · u 2 2 , in which xi , ρi , and ui represent the mole fractions, densities, and speeds of sound of pure components, respectively, and ρ and u are the density and speed of sound of mixtures. The deviations in viscosity were calculated using the following equation [71]: (4) Δ η = η - x 1 η 1 + x 2 η 2 , in which xi and ηi , represent the mole fractions and dynamic viscosities of pure components, respectively, and η is the dynamic viscosity of mixtures. The excess Gibbs energy of activation for viscous flow (ΔG *E) [72] was calculated by: (5) Δ G ∗ E RT = ln η · V - x 1 · ln η 1 · V 1 - x 2 · ln η 2 · V 2 , in which η represents the dynamic viscosity of mixtures, η 1 and η 2 are the dynamic viscosities of pure components, V is the molar volume, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The experimental results were fitted with a Redlich-Kister type equation [73]: (6) Y m E = x 1 1 - x 1 ∑ j = 0 j = n A j 2 x 1 - 1 j , in which Y m E represents V m E , Δ κ S , Δη or Δ G ∗ E , x 1 is the mole fraction of component 1, Aj are the adjustable coefficients obtained by the method of least squares, and n is the degree of the polynomial. The coefficients A j for V m E , Δ κ S , Δη or Δ G ∗ E are given in Tables 4–7 , respectively, along with the corresponding standard deviations calculated using the following equation: (7) σ = ∑ Y ( expt ) E - Y ( cal ) E 2 / N - n 1 / 2 , in which N represents the number of data points and n is the order of fitting polynomial. We have also calculated the partial molar volumes from excess molar volume data using [74]: (8) V ¯ 1 = V m E + V 1 o + 1 - x 1 ∂ V m E ∂ x 1 (9) V ¯ 2 = V m E + V 2 o + 1 - x 2 ∂ V m E ∂ x 2 Differentiation of equation (6) with respect to x 1 and combination with equations (8) and (9) leads to the following equations for the partial molar volumes: (10) V ¯ 1 = V 1 o + 1 - x 1 2 ∑ j = 0 n A j 2 x 1 - 1 j + 2 x 1 1 - x 1 2 ∑ j = 0 n A j · j · 2 x 1 - 1 j - 1 (11) V ¯ 2 = V 2 o + x 1 2 ∑ j = 0 n A j 2 x 1 - 1 j - 2 1 - x 1 x 1 2 ∑ j = 0 n A j · j · 2 x 1 - 1 j - 1 The excess partial molar volumes were calculated by: (12) V ¯ 1 E = V ¯ 1 - V 1 O (13) V ¯ 2 E = V ¯ 2 - V 2 O The apparent molar volumes can be expressed as: (14) V φ 1 = V m E + x 1 V 1 o x 1 , (15) V φ 2 = V m E + x 2 V 2 o x 2 , The partial molar volumes at infinite dilution can be calculated by: (16) V ¯ 1 ∞ = V 1 o + ∑ j = 0 n A j - 1 j (17) V ¯ 2 ∞ = V 2 o + ∑ j = 0 n A j These volumetric properties are listed in Table S1. Table 8 shows partial molar volumes at infinite dilution at several temperatures for all studied mixtures. Figs. S24–S27 present the behaviour of the excess properties V m E , Δ κ S , Δ η and Δ G ∗ E as a function of ionic liquid mole fraction for the four systems studied at five different temperatures (293.15–313.15) K. For all binary mixtures, excess molar volume, deviations in viscosity and deviations in isentropic compressibility presented negative values over the whole composition range and for all studied temperatures. When the temperature increases, the values of V m E and Δ κ S become more negative. However, the deviation in viscosity follows an opposed behaviour, i.e. the higher the temperature, the less negative the values. When it comes to Δ G ∗ E , its values are positive over the entire composition range for all the analysed temperatures and this property rises with increasing temperature. The results show asymmetrical curves with minima between x 1 = 0.30–0.40 related to V m E and to Δ κ S , x 1 = 0.60–0.70 for Δ η and maxima between x 1 = 0.30–0.40 for Δ G ∗ E . Negative V m E can be attributed to chemical or specific interactions between the species present in the mixtures or to structural effects due to differences in molar and free volumes, resulting in packing effects between the compounds. N-butylammonium methanoate is a protic IL and can form hydrogen bonds with acceptors proton. In the binary systems, it is possible to observe the breaking of the hydrogen bonds of associated structure of the pure liquid molecules with subsequent formation of a complex interaction between the N4Met and the alcohols. According to Fig. S24, for all binary mixtures, the highest volume contraction takes place in the concentrated region of alcohols. It is possible that in this region the disruption of the structure of the ionic liquids allows a greater interstitial accommodation between the molecules present in the mixture. In addition to structural effects, it is also possible to occur hydrogen bonds between alkanols that are proton acceptors and N4Met, whose proton is available in the cation NH3 + [10]. For all systems studied, V m E becomes more negative with temperature. Since chemical effects must decrease with increasing temperature, the greater contraction of excess molar volume with rising temperature could be explained as a better interstitial accommodation of molecules when the temperature increases, leading to a more negative V m E value. Comparing V m E values for all binary mixtures at 298.15 K, this sequence may be observed: ethanol > 1-propanol > 1-butanol > 1-pentanol (Fig. 4 ). Therefore, as carbon chain size increases, the packing efficiency of the compounds is worse and the hydrogen bonding between the IL and alcohol is weaker, since the carbon chain contributes to the reduction of polarity [75]. It can be observed in Table 8 that there is a considerable difference between molar volumes of N4Met and alcohols, which contributes to explain the negative V m E by considering the interstitial accommodation of the alcohol molecules into clusters/space of N4Met. Fig. S25 shows Δ κ S behaviour and it is possible to conclude that it follows the same way as the excess molar volume does. Structural effects due to differences in molecule sizes and shapes result in the accommodation of one component into each other, contributing to a negative Δ κ S . When the temperature increases, so does deviation in isentropic compressibility in absolute value, meaning that the mixture becomes less compressible. The increase in temperature favours better interstitial accommodation of the molecules leading to a more compact and less compressible structure. Fig. 5 shows a comparison among the systems studied in terms of deviation in isentropic compressibility. The absolute Δ κ S values decrease when increasing the chain length of the alcohols following the sequence: ethanol > 1-propanol > 1-butanol > 1-pentanol. For all binary mixtures, Δη values are negative over the whole composition range and at all different temperatures. When the temperature rises, deviation in viscosity becomes less negative. Fig. S26 shows Δη behaviour and it is possible to observe that the temperature seems to significantly influence the property for all systems studied. The negative values can be explained as a result of predominance of dispersion or weak ion–dipole forces in the mixtures analysed. Moreover, it suggests that intermolecular interactions between unlike species are weaker than those between like species. In this way, the minimum values are located in the rich-IL region, proving that weak ion–dipole forces are dominating. Moreover, negative deviation in viscosity concludes that the solution viscosity is lower than that of the pure species, allowing a greater fluidity of the formed mixture. Taking all the binary mixtures, it is possible to observe that when the carbon chain size becomes larger, Δη decreases slightly in absolute values as shown in Fig. 6 . Primary alcohols have a self-association characteristic, which is favoured by reducing the carbon chain length [76]. Therefore, the system containing ethanol presents the highest negative values for Δη, indicating the weakest interaction between solute-solvent, which agrees with the self-associative feature. For the other alcohols mixtures, differences in Δη values are not as significant when compared to the ethanol-containing system. According to Fig. S27, Δ G ∗ E values are positive for all binary mixtures. This behaviour can be explained by intermolecular interactions, such as ion-dipole and hydrogen bonds, considering that protic ILs are polar compounds so that they are able to make hydrogen bonds and amphiphilic self-assemblies [37]. Concerning the structural effects, differences in size and shape of molecules lead to better interstitial accommodation of unlike molecules. The peak of the excess property is located in the same place of V m E and Δ κ S in terms of IL mole fraction (x 1 = 0.30–0.40) and become more positive with increasing temperature, suggesting that structural effects must play an important role in the behaviour of thermodynamic properties. Comparing all systems in Fig. 7 , the system containing ethanol presents the highest magnitude of Δ G ∗ E . In view of the fact that ethanol contains the smallest carbon chain, it fits better into the IL structure and makes stronger hydrogen bonds than the other larger alcohols. Figs. S28–S31 show the partial molar volumes and apparent molar volumes of N4Met and alcohols at 298.15 K. The partial molar volume of N4Met, V ¯ 1 , increased while the partial molar volume of alcohols, V ¯ 2 , decreased, with an increase in N4Met concentration. The partial molar volume of N4Met in all mixtures is almost constant between x 1 = 0.6 and x 1 = 1, which suggests that N4Met-alcohol structure is little changed compared to that of pure N4Met. However, between x 1 = 0 and x 1 = 0.6, N4Met in the mixtures takes less volume than in the pure state. This occurs possibly due to the decrease in the interactions by hydrogen bonds among alcohol molecules, leading to an increase in N4Met-alcohol interactions. Figs. S32 and S33 present negative results for excess partial molar volumes. For all systems analyzed, these values are negative and can indicate that the interaction of unlike molecules is stronger than that of alike molecules."
6,Viscosity correlation,"3.2 Viscosity correlation The experimental viscosity data were correlated as a function of composition at different temperatures using four equations for binary systems. These equations present parameters (G 12, Δ 12, W 12 and η 12), representing the interaction force between the unlike molecules present in the solution. Grünberg-Nissan equation [77]: (18) ln η = x 1 · ln η 1 + x 2 · ln η 2 + x 1 · x 2 · G 12 Heric -Brewer equation [78]: (19) ln η = x 1 · ln η 1 + x 2 · ln η 2 + x 1 · ln M 1 + x 2 · ln M 2 - ln ( x 1 · M 1 + x 2 · M 2 ) + x 1 · x 2 · Δ 12 Van der Wyk equation [79]: (20) ln η = x 1 2 · ln ( η 1 · η 2 η 12 2 ) + 2 · x 1 · ln ( η 12 η 2 ) + ln η 2 Katti-Chaudhri equation [80]: (21) ln ( η V ) = x 1 ln ( η 1 V 1 ) + x 2 ln ( η 2 V 2 ) + x 1 x 2 W 12 RT The parameters G 12, Δ 12, W 12 and η 12 are given in Table 9 , along with the corresponding average relative deviations (ARD%) calculated as follows: (22) ARD % = 100 N ∑ η cal - η exp η exp , in which η calc represents the calculated viscosity by the mixing rule and η exp is the experimental value. Fig. S34 shows the experimental data as well as a correlated model with the lowest ARD at 298.15 K, as it can be seen in Table 9. It is possible to observe in Table 9 that the models show good and quite similar fitting results using only one parameter with maximum percentage average relative deviations (ARD%) between 4 and 7%."
7,Spectroscopic properties,"3.3 Spectroscopic properties The values of chemical shift (δ) in 1H NMR for the binary mixtures {n-butylammonium methanoate + alcohols} were used over the N4Met composition range in order to determine the chemical shift deviation (Δδ), which points out specific interactions between the solute and solvent. The following equation [81] is also known as the additive rule: (23) Δ δ = δ - ( x 1 δ 1 ∞ + x 2 δ 2 ∞ ) , in which δ 1 ∞ and δ 2 ∞ represent the chemical shift values for the hydrogen atom of the cation (NH3 +) from pure IL and at infinite dilution, respectively. The values of δ 2 ∞ were obtained through extrapolation for x 2 = 1. Deviation from ideality in the 1H NMR chemical shift, Δδ, for all the binary mixtures studied is listed in Table 10 . Figs. S20–S23 show 1H NMR spectra as a function of IL concentration for all mixtures studied. It is possible to observe very large variations in chemical shifts of the hydrogen from the IL cation (NH3 +). Further exploring the spectra, the additive rule was evaluated as another tool to confirm and extend our knowledge about intermolecular forces of the systems, as it can be checked in Table 10. In Fig. S35, it can be observed that Δ δ is positive, possibly as a result of predominance of interactions such as Van der Waals forces, namely ion-dipole between cation and anion from N4Met [82]. The lowest deviation was obtained for the ethanol-containing system and the highest values occurred in the ionic liquid poor region of approximately x 1 ≈ 0.2, while for other mixtures the highest values are located in the same IL molar fraction (x 1 ≈ 0.5). Moreover, the deviation in chemical shifts for the systems containing 1-propanol, 1-butanol and 1-pentanol presents very close behaviour and magnitude when compared to the system with ethanol. This spectroscopic analysis agrees with V m E , Δ κ S and Δ G ∗ E analyses, because ethanol has the strongest interaction with N4Met, resulting in the highest deviation from ideality for all these properties. However, this conclusion is contrary to Δη, which indicates that ethanol interacts the least with the IL. These opposed ideas come from many chemical factors, such as polarity, solvation, hydrogen bonding capacity, which affect specific interactions between unlike species, while Δη includes both physical and chemical effects [83]. Fig. S36 shows FTIR spectra for all binary mixtures and the bands relative to NH and CO increase their absorbance when the IL concentration also increases. Besides, these bands vary their positions subtly since they are ions and there are ion-dipole forces taking place in the systems. Furthermore, as the solution composition changes, the interactions and the neighborhood among the molecules change as well, reflecting in the shifting and in the chemical shifts in 1H NMR spectra."
8,Conclusions,"Density, speed of sound and viscosity for binary mixtures containing protic ionic liquid {n-butylammonium methanoate (N4Met) + ethanol, or +1-propanol, or +1-butanol, or +1-pentanol} were measured in the whole concentration range at different temperatures T = (293.15 – 313.15) K under atmospheric pressure. Volumetric, acoustic and viscometric properties such as excess molar volume, V m E , deviation in isentropic compressibility, Δ κ S , deviation in viscosity, Δη, and excess Gibbs energy of activation of viscous flow, Δ G ∗ E , were determined from experimental results and fitted to the Redlich-Kister polynomial. Other volumetric properties (partial molar volume, V ¯ i , apparent molar volume, V ϕ i , excess partial molar volumes, V ¯ i E , and their infinite dilution, V ¯ i ∞ ) were determined. The values of V m E , Δ κ S and Δη were negative, whereas Δ G ∗ E were positive over the entire composition range. 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FTIR spectroscopic results complemented the thermodynamic results. These results show that structural effects play an important role in the behaviour of thermodynamic properties since the highest deviation values for V m E , Δ κ S and Δ G ∗ E are approximately in the same IL composition (x 1 = 0.30–0.40), whereas for Δ η , the highest deviations are situated in x 1 = 0.60–0.70. Moreover, the chemical interactions, namely hydrogen bonds, among the alcohols and N4Met increase in this way: ethanol > 1-propanol > 1-butanol > 1-pentanol. In terms of structural effects, it is the same tendency because of steric effects. Therefore, the smaller carbon chain favors both packing efficiency and alcohol-IL interactions. The models used to correlate viscosity data showed good fitting with the experimental results using only one parameter. An examination shows that these models presented fitting results with maximum percentage average relative deviations (ARD%) between 4 and 7%. The viscosity mixing rules fit well with the experimental viscosity data. According to the temperature influence on the Grünberg-Nissan parameters, all binary liquid systems deviate negatively from Raoult’s law."
