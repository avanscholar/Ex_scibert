0,Introduction,"In the last decades, hydrogen, as an energy source, has gained an increased attention due to the depletion of fossil fuels. Today hydrogen is usually used in fuel cells for electricity production [1]. Hydrogen is a clean energy source since its combustion product is only water. It is not readily available in nature and is currently being generated by the reforming of natural gas. Alternatively, converting lignocellulosic biomass into hydrogen is a novel methodology put in practice in recent years [2]. Hydrogen production from biomass provides benefit not only in the utilization of waste biomass originating from factories but also for the development of novel energy production technologies. Moreover, CO2 emission is not increased due to its production and consecutive consumption as growing plants take up as much CO2 as is released during use [3,4]. Conventional gasification technologies have low thermal energy due to the pre-drying process of feedstock prior to gasification [5]. One of the alternative ways of producing hydrogen from biomass is gasification in supercritical water (SCWG) conditions. It has great potential for the conversion of high-moisture-content biomass to produce high concentrations of hydrogen and other gases such as CO2, CH4, small amounts of CO and light hydrocarbons without a drying process of the biomass feedstock. It is also possible to reach high gasification efficiencies compared to conventional gasification techniques [6]. Water above its critical conditions (Tc = 647 K, Pc = 22.0 MPa) has unique properties such as a lower dielectric constant, lower and weaker hydrogen bonds which makes it possible for water to dissolve organic material in the gaseous phase enabling the reactions to be carried out in a single fluid phase leading to an increase in the reaction rates by eliminating mass transfer barriers between phases [7,8]. Also, water serves both as a reactant and a reaction medium leading to low tar and char yields [9]. The gaseous product can widely be used in gas turbines for power generation, for chemical synthesis, in fuel cells and for oil upgrade [10,11]. Reaction of water with biomass (fruit pulp) has been proposed using the global mol balance in the following: (1) C H 1.51 O 0.70 + 1.3 H 2 O → C O 2 + 2.055 H 2 Gasification of biomass in supercritical water proceeds through a complex reaction mechanism which is divided into two pathways: ionic and free radical reactions whose predominance depends on water density and acidity [7,12]. Around the critical point, the main reaction mechanism changes from ionic in subcritical to free radical in the supercritical region, favoring formation of gases [13]. At high temperature and low water density, a free radical pathway leads to the formation of acids, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, alcohols and ketones which are then converted to gases via decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions [14]. High pressure should be kept during reactor heat up to always keep a dense, liquid phase in the reactor [15]. The formation of gaseous products (H2, CO2, CO and CH4) is carried out via water-gas shift, hydrogenation and methanation reactions [11]. Water-gas shift reaction: (2) CO + H 2 O → C O 2 + H 2 Δ H 298 K = − 41 kJ / mol Methanation of CO: (3) CO + 3 H 2 → C H 4 + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 206.2 kJ / mol Methanation of CO2: (4) C O 2 + 4 H 2 → C H 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 165.0 kJ / mol Hydrogenation reaction: (5) CO + 2 H 2 ↔ C H 4 + 0 . 5 O 2 Δ H 298 K = 35.7 kJ / mol CO is the primary product in SCWG and it reacts with steam to produce additional H 2 and CO 2 through the water–gas shift reaction. Depending on the reaction temperature the main gas component varies, i.e. CH4 is the main component at low temperature gasification and H2 is the major component at higher temperatures [16]. Composition of the gaseous mixture depend strongly on the reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, initial biomass concentration, residence time, catalyst type [17]. Various studies regarding SCWG of biomass and biomass model compounds have been conducted so far. SCWG of real biomass feedstocks such as black liquor, sewage disposals, paper sludge, corn grass, tannery wastes, cotton stalk, corncob, woody materials, wastewater, microalgae, sawdust, baby food, zoo mass, corn silage, potato wastes, cheese whey, coffee grounds, fish processing waste rice straw, almond shell [3,18–29] or biomass model compounds like glucose, cellulose, lignin, glycerol, phenol, catechol, pyrocatechol, methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, starch and acetone, isooctane [6–9,11,12,30–32] were carried out by many researchers. There have also been some studies on the development of a suitable catalyst with high H2 and CH4 selectivity [26,33–37]. Studies reported in the literature have also concerned with the effect of operating parameters, such as reaction time, pressure, concentration, catalyst type and amount [17,27,38,39]. A wide variety of studies have shown that homogenous alkali metal catalysts such as KOH, NaOH, CaCO3, K2CO3 and heterogeneous metal catalysts such as Ru, Rh, Ni, Cr, Co, Zn, Pd, Ti and Mo can considerably enhance the gasification efficiency. Generally, alkali metal catalysts enhance the water-gas shift reaction, resulting in a significant increase in the H2 yield [18,40]. At low temperatures, the following reaction mechanism proposed earlier is given below [41,42]. KOH reacts with CO to form formate ion: (6) KOH + CO → HCOOK Hydrogen is formed according to the reaction of formate with excess water: (7) HCOOK + H 2 O → KHC O 3 + H 2 The catalyst cycle is completed with decomposition of KHCO3 and a consequent conversion of K2CO3 to KOH as shown in the following equations: (8) 2 KHC O 3 ↔ C O 2 + K 2 C O 3 + H 2 O (9) K 2 C O 3 + H 2 O → KHC O 3 + KOH The overall reaction is the WGSR: (10) CO + H 2 O → C O 2 + H 2 Besides, KOH can react with CO2 to form carbonate salts, especially at high temperatures based on the reactions below [42]. (11) 2 KOH + C O 2 → K 2 C O 3 + H 2 O (12) K 2 C O 3 + C O 2 + H 2 O ↔ 2 KHC O 3 To the best of our knowledge, although there are some reports on the SCWG of many biomass feedstocks in the presence of KOH, there is no study available in the literature on supercritical water gasification of fruit pulp using KOH with an aim to enhance hydrogen yield in the gas products. The main motivation of this study is to investigate the effect of prominent reaction parameters on hydrogen production in fruit pulp gasification under supercritical water conditions. In this context, effect of process variables such as temperature, reaction time, biomass to water ratio and catalyst to biomass ratio on the gasification efficiency, composition of the gas and liquid products and amounts of the gas products have been investigated. Also, analysis of the liquid phase was performed in order to interpret the results. So this study presents new experimental data in terms of the gas product compositions of supercritical fruit pulp gasification for different reaction conditions."
1,Materials and experimental methods,
2,Biomass and chemicals,"2.1 Biomass and chemicals Fruit pulp, which is a waste product of a fruit juice factory, was supplied from Aroma, Turkey. Elemental analysis, the inorganic constituents, amount of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, extractives with ash, water, protein, oil and energy content of the fruit pulp were determined according to the standard procedures [43,44]. All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received."
3,Apparatus and procedure for biomass gasiﬁcation,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure for biomass gasiﬁcation The experiments were conducted in a batch reactor (Inconel 625, 200 mL internal volume, maximum temperature 650 °C, maximum pressure 35 MPa) specially designed and manufactured by Parker Hannifin Cooperation-Autoclave Engineers, USA. The reactor is embedded in a furnace and temperature and pressure of the reactor are controlled and monitored by a Sentinel Console. A pipeline connects the reactor through a pneumatic valve which is closed during the reaction and then the reactor effluents are passed through a cooler to which a chiller is connected. A back-pressure regulator reduces the pressure of the cold product from a high pressure to ambient. After leaving the back pressure regulator, the products pass through a gas-liquid separator. The gas flow rate is measured by a mass flow meter ( Fig. 1). Experiments were carried out at conditions above the critical values of water (372 °C and 22 MPa). The fruit pulp, water (2.5–10% wt./wt.) and KOH (0–30% wt./wt.) were weighed, loaded into the reactor and the reactor was swept by Ar in order to remove all the air inside. The vessel was then heated to the desired temperature with a constant heating rate of 5 °C/min. The pressure increased due to the increase in temperature and the final pressure depended on the amount of the feedstock loaded into the reactor. As soon as the reaction time was finished, pressure of the system was set to a lower value than the pressure in the reactor so that the products could move through the lines and to the Micro-Gas Chromatography (μ-GC) in order to analyze the gaseous mixture on-line. The contents of the reactor were collected with dichloromethane (DCM). The solid product was separated by filtration, dried in an oven overnight and weighed. The DCM-soluble (tar) and water soluble products were separated by extraction. The water soluble products were subjected to some HCl solution of 2.0 M until its pH was 7.0 to precipitate any metals and further filtrated to remove the suspended particles."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Analysis of the gaseous products was carried out using a μGC (A-3000 Gas Analyzer SRA Instruments, Italy) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The analysis was carried out at constant column temperatures of 90 °C and 70 °C, respectively using MS5A and PPQ columns. Injection temperatures for both columns were 90 °C with an analysis time of 180 s. A standard gas mixture was used for calibration. Amount of the gaseous products were determined by a mass flow meter, which had been factory calibrated for N2, and was converted to real flow of gas by using conversion factor based on the following equations. (13) CF mix = 1 C 1 CF 1 + C 2 CF 2 + C 3 CF 3 … … … . . + C N CF N (14) V g = CF mix * ( V MFM ) where CFmix denotes the conversion factor of the gaseous mixture calculated using the conversion factors of the individual gas components (C1, C2, C3, CN), C is the molar ratio of the components determined from μGC analysis, VMFM is total volume of the gas based on N2 flow and Vg is the actual volume of the gas. The number of moles of the gas was calculated according to the ideal gas equation. The conversion factors for individual gas components, which had been experimentally determined, were obtained from the supplier of the reactor and those values for main gas components such as H2, CO2, CH4 and CO are 1.021, 0.745, 0.731 and 1.001, respectively. Carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) and hydrogen gasification efficiency (HGE) were calculated on a water and ash free basis using the following equations. (15) CGE ( % , mol ) = number of moles of C in the gas phase number of moles of C in the biomass x 100 (16) HGE ( % , mol ) = number of moles of H in the gas phase number of moles of H in the biomass x 100 Qualitative analysis of the tar and water soluble products was conducted using a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 GC coupled to a Hewlett-Packard model 5973 mass selective detector. For the DCM-soluble products, a HP-5 ms column (30 m x 0.32 mm ID x 0.25 mm) was used with He as the carrier gas. The sample was diluted to 0.2 mg sample/10 mL DCM and injected with 1 μL volume as splitless. The oven was programmed to operate at 40 °C for 3 min, followed by a 5 °C/min. ramp to 300 °C and held at this temperature for 8 min. A HP-FFAP column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 mm) was used to analyze water-soluble products. The oven was programmed to operate at 60 °C for 2 min, followed by a 10 °C/min. ramp to 220 °C and held at this temperature for 10 min The crystalline structure of the solid product was analyzed using an X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) instrument (Rigaku, MiniFlex 600 W, Japan) at a scanning rate of 1–4º/min. and 2θ = 5–95º. The carbon and hydrogen contents of liquid products (tar and water-soluble) as well as solid product in establishing carbon balances was determined using an Elemental Analyzer (Leco, TruSpec CHN, USA)."
5,Results and discussions,"The physical and chemical properties of the fruit pulp are given in Table 1. It can be observed that the fruit pulp mainly consisted of hemicellulose and cellulose with a high moisture content of 78%. In SCWG of biomass, the distribution and compositions of the products and gasification efficiency depend strongly on the reaction conditions as well as the composition of the biomass [21]. The present work deals with the reaction parameters such as temperature (400–600 °C), time (30–180 min), biomass ratio (2.5–10.0%) and catalyst ratio (0–30%). Pressure has a negligible effect on hydrogen yield above the critical pressure of water so the pressure was kept constant at 27 MPa during the runs [34]. All the experimental runs were repeated at least twice to ensure the reliability of the results. The mass fraction of hydrogen in the fruit pulp according to elemental analysis results is 6.05%, so the maximum amount of hydrogen that could be obtained from biomass is 30.5 mol H2/kg fruit pulp and the theoretical yield of hydrogen gas based on the steam reforming reaction of fruit pulp (Eq. (1)) is 83.2 g H2/kg fruit pulp when the pulp is gasified completely to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The contribution of water to the hydrogen gas production is obviously seen from the values indicated since water is not only the reaction medium but also acts as a reactant. The experimental hydrogen yields obtained in this study were compared with the theoretical yield."
6,Effect of reaction conditions on the efficiency and yields of the gas products,"3.1 Effect of reaction conditions on the efficiency and yields of the gas products 3.1.1 Effect of reaction temperature The reaction temperature is a significant parameter that affects both the efficiency of the gasification reaction and the distribution of the gas, liquid and solid products as well as the composition of the gaseous product. Fig. 2 shows the effect of temperature on the gas yield and gasification efficiency for 60 min reaction time. As Fig. 2 depicts, the gas product mainly consisted of H2, CO2, CH4 and small amounts of CO, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8. At low temperatures, the major component was CO2 since decarboxylation reactions of organic acids were more dominant than the other gas formation reactions. However, water became a strong oxidizing agent with the increase in temperature and this triggered the formation of the free radical reactions causing a decrease in CO2 fraction in the mixture [45]. According to Fig. 2a, CO2 gas yield (mol CO2/kg biomass) increased with temperature. However, the molar fraction of CO2 in the mixture decreased since the rates of increase in the amount of hydrogen as well as methane were higher than that of CO2. Furthermore, the decrease in CO2 fraction could stem from the dissolution of CO2 in the aqueous medium. All in all, amount of CO2 ranged between 9.1 and 12.4 mol/kg biomass due to the increase of gas volume at higher temperatures. Increasing the temperature favored the formation of hydrogen and at temperatures higher than 500 °C; H2 became the major product due to the formation of radical reactions, which were known to be enhanced at high temperatures as also reported earlier by Jin et al. [46]. For a constant reaction time of 60 min; at 400 °C, the amount of hydrogen was 2.4 mol/kg biomass while it increased to 20.2 mol/kg biomass at 600 °C. The amount of CO varied between 0.02 and 0.08 mol/kg biomass for all temperature ranges. Most of the CO was expected to originate from water soluble organic compounds, which were the preliminary products of biomass hydrolysis. CO was then consumed either through water-gas shift reaction or methanation reaction [47]. A very low CO content was due to the presence of KOH, which is known to be a very efficient catalyst for WGSR. The amount of CH4 increased with an increase in temperature due to methanation of CO and CO2 and varied between 0.3 and 5.7 mol/kg biomass. However, it should be pointed out that water gas shift reaction predominates over methanation reactions at high temperatures since KOH catalyzes the WGSR rather than methane reforming (MR) so the amount of hydrogen increased much faster than that of methane. Similarly, CGE increased from 26.5% to 55.5% with an increase of temperature from 400° to 600 °C. The greatest increase can be observed in HGE as from 15.0% to 123.9% which was due to the high concentrations of hydrogen and methane at 600 °C. The source of hydrogen gas by SCWG of biomass is not only biomass itself but also water, which contributes significant amount of hydrogen to the gaseous product [6–8,21,46]. At high temperatures, almost the entire hydrogen atom fed to the reactor, either in biomass or water, left the system in the gaseous product, only trace amounts of hydrogen atom in the liquid and solid products were observed based on the elemental analysis results. 3.1.2 Effect of reaction time Reaction time is very significant in terms of the energy consumed during supercritical water gasification. In this study, the suitable reaction time at varying reaction temperatures resulting in high hydrogen yield has been explored. Fig. 3 depicts the effect of reaction time on gas product yields at different reaction temperatures. At 400 °C (Fig. 3a), the amount of H2 and CH4 increased up to 120 min, reaching a plateau thereafter. So prolonging the reaction time to 180 min is unnecessary to increase the yield of hydrogen. At 500 °C (Fig. 3b), there is no difference between the amounts of hydrogen obtained at 60 min and 120 min, therefore 60 min is suitable for this temperature. At 600 °C (Fig. 3c), the system comes to equilibrium at 60 min. Williams et al. reported that the hydrogen gas yield and gasification efficiency did not show a significant increase with reaction time in the gasification of glucose in supercritical water and they concluded that 60 min is suitable to obtain the highest amount of hydrogen. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the yield of bio-oil decreased significantly and an increase of char and water-soluble products with temperature was observed [6]. In order to obtain a high gas conversion in the gasification of high concentration biomass, high temperature, high heating rate or reaction time and efficient catalyst are required. 3.1.3 Effect of biomass ratio In order to investigate the effect of biomass ratio on the composition of the gas product and gasification efficiency, biomass ratio of 2.5–10% was applied at a constant temperature of 600 °C and for varying reaction time of 30–60 min and the results are showed in Fig. 4. As it is observed from Fig. 4a, the yield of H2 decreased rapidly from 32.8 mol/kg biomass to 4.3% mol/kg biomass with an increase of biomass ratio from 2.5% to 10%, which is approximately eight times less. The same trend could be observed in the amount of CO2. CH4 yield increased slightly from 4.0 to 5.7 mol/kg biomass with an increase of biomass ratio from 2.5% to 5%, however further increase of biomass ratio resulted in a decrease of CH4 amount to 1.7 mol/kg biomass which could be attributed to inadequate reaction time for high biomass ratio. Also, a slight increase in CO yield was observed. This result showed that water was not only a reaction medium but also a reactant which provided hydrogen. The trends of the experimental yield of gaseous species are in good agreement with the literature [4,48]. Furthermore, CGE and HGE decreased with increasing biomass ratio (Fig. 4b). Increasing the biomass ratio can result in the formation of heavy hydrocarbons and coke which will cause plugging of the reactor. Also, higher operating temperatures are needed for complete gasification of high concentration of biomass [20]. Williams and Onwudili claimed that a significant decrease in the amount of gas products and a decrease in the amount of solid and bio-oil was observed with the increase of biomass ratio [6]. Furthermore, when biomass with a high concentration is used, some salts in the biomass, which are insoluble in supercritical water, will precipitate leading to clogging of the reactor. Also, more biomass means more ash, which can also lead to undesirable clogging [4]. Biomass ratio of the feed should be optimized in order to ensure the energy content of the feed compensates the energy loss of the process. The high content of the water can be a disadvantage in terms of the high heat capacity of the water since amount of heat to increase the operating temperature of the system will increase [49]. 3.1.4 Effect of catalyst amount Fig. 5 displays the effect of catalyst amount on the yields of gas products and gasification efficiency. The first bar on Fig. 5a shows the gas yields when there is no catalyst in the reactor and the value of hydrogen yield was 16.0 mol/kg biomass, which is approximately 40% less than the yield achieved for the condition in which 5% KOH (26.9 mol/kg biomass) was used. The suitable amount of KOH is 10% by wt. under the experimental conditions which gave the highest hydrogen amount (32.1 mol/kg biomass). No real influence on H2 yield could be observed by the increase of catalyst ratio beyond 10%. CO2 and CH4 had the similar trends; however amount of CO decreased with the addition of catalyst. HGE increased with the addition of KOH up to 10% ratio (153.5%) and decreased slightly with further amount of catalyst. CGE had its highest value (59.6%) at 10% catalyst ratio and tend to decrease thereafter. Without catalyst, HGE was found to be 81.8%. It was demonstrated that catalyst amount was less effective at higher temperatures. Wu et al. gasified glucose in supercritical water to investigate the effect of reaction temperature with and without catalyst at different reaction temperatures (400–600 °C) and they demonstrated that the effect of catalyst on gasification efficiency was very significant at low temperatures and more pronounced compared to the reaction conditions at higher temperatures [50]."
7,Liquid and solid products,"3.2 Liquid and solid products In SCWG, formation of liquid product (water-soluble and organic solvent-soluble (tar)) occurs at low temperatures, before appreciable amount of gas products are formed. The yield and composition of the liquid product depend strongly on the reaction parameters among which temperature is the most important one. At low temperatures, a dark colored product is obtained, whereas at higher temperatures products as almost transparent as water are obtained which indicates that the liquid products are readily converted into gaseous products. The composition of the water-soluble and DCM-soluble products at different reaction temperatures are given in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. According to Table 2, the water soluble products contain ketones, organic acids, phenols, esters and amides. The amount of phenols was very low for all temperature ranges and tends to decrease with temperature, which was probably converted into organic acids and ketones with the double effect of catalyst and temperature. The major compounds are organic acids at all temperatures. The relative ratio of acetic acid is the highest among the organic acids owing to its stability. Even though the relative percentage of organic acids in the water soluble products seemed to increase with temperature, their amounts decreased since the conversion yield of water soluble products dropped from 19.6% to 6.8% with an increase of temperature from 400 °C to 600 °C. This proves that the water-soluble compounds were readily converted into gas species at high temperatures. Acetic acid, which is one of the major effluents of hydrothermal reactions of organic wastes, is assumed to form in two steps. The first one is conversion of carbohydrates to 5-HMF, furaldehyde and lactic acid followed by their oxidation to acetic acid [51]. Acetic acid and formic acid are known to be the major components of supercritical gasification of glucose with other organic acids in smaller quantities [52]. The reason why there was no formic acid in the water-soluble products is that it was formed as an intermediate product and converted into CO2 and H2 through water-gas shift reaction. Sasaki et al. identified the composition of water-soluble products at subcritical and supercritical conditions for the gasification of cellulose and they reported that under critical conditions of water, 5-HMF and furaldehyde were the major components of water-soluble products while they were not present above critical conditions [52]. The results listed in Table 3 indicated that DCM-soluble liquid phase consisted of phenols, ketones, alkanes, alkenes, esters, benzenes, PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and HAHs (heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). While the amount of aromatic compounds was high at low temperature with benzene and phenol as the major substances (62.7%), PAHs were obtained as the major products (53.2%) at high temperatures due to the reactions of olefins with aromatic hydrocarbons [53]. As PAHs, which have harmful effects on human health, were not formed at low temperatures, the DCM-soluble products obtained at this condition can be utilized as raw materials such as resins, adhesives, solvents and fertilizers in chemical industry. Moreover, the DCM-soluble products can be upgraded by additional processes such as Fischer-Tropsch catalytic synthesis and used as synthetic transportation oil when blended with diesel [54,55]. XRD scan results of the solid products produced at 400 °C and 600 °C are illustrated in Fig. 6. The peaks at 32° and 65° 2θ could be attributed to KOH, which can be observed in XRD patterns of both solid products. At 400 °C, KOH did not undergo any changes, however, at 600°, the peaks observed at 25°, 31° and 55° belong to K2CO3, which was formed by the reaction of KOH with the dissolved CO2 through reactions 12 and 13 leading to a decrease in the amount of CO2. As a result, the catalytic activity of KOH was enhanced at 600 °C, which resulted in the decrease of CO fractions and increase of H2 amount in the bulk gas mixture [56]."
8,Carbon balance,"3.3 Carbon balance The total carbon distribution in terms of gas, liquid and solid products are given in Table 4. The carbon balance closures are 92.8% and 94.8%, which are quite reasonable values. The carbon unaccounted can be attributed to the carbon hold-up in the system. Carbon content of the gas product increased while those of liquid and solid products decreased with increasing temperature. However, the rate of decrease of carbon in the water-soluble liquid product was less than those of solid and DCM-soluble liquid products since some of the CO2 reacted with KOH at high temperature and remained in water phase (Table 4). Accordingly, the amount of carbon in the gas products did not rise rapidly with increasing temperature. This result was also supported by XRD analysis. The HHV of the liquid (DCM-soluble and water soluble) and solid products were calculated using Dulong's formula and those for gases were calculated using the individual calorific values of the gas species and the results along with their yields are given in Table 5 [57]. C, H and O contents of liquid and solid products were determined by elemental analysis. The elemental composition of the gas product was determined by calculating the amount of each gas component in the mixture using the molar percentage output of μGC together with the total gas volume and then calculating the total amounts of individual elements originating from different gas components and converting these values to the elemental mass percentages. (17) HHV MJ / kg = 0 , 3383 C + 1 , 422 ( H − O / 8 ) HHV of the gas product in the presence of noncombustible CO2 is 35.4 MJ/kg at 400 °C and 40.7 at 600 °C MJ/kg. If CO2 is excluded from the gas mixture, the HHV increases to 69.8 MJ/kg at 400 °C and 77.6 MJ/kg at 600 °C. The heating value of the gas products obtained from the supercritical water gasification of fruit pulp was enhanced significantly in comparison to that of raw biomass (16.71 MJ/kg)."
9,Comparison of the present results with the recent literature,"3.4 Comparison of the present results with the recent literature Present results have been compared with the recent literature in order to gain a better understanding of fruit pulp gasification as seen in Table 6. In recent years, SCWG of model compounds such as glucose, cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose at different operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, feed concentration, residence time and catalyst type to understand thoroughly regarding the complex nature of SCWG process and to predict product yields and conversion efficiencies during the gasification of heterogeneous biomass waste, food waste, sewage sludge, and other available feedstocks. SCWG process has been carried out in either batch or continuous reactors at the lab-scale. Continuous systems have some advantages over batch systems such as higher heating rates leading to a lower residence time and subsequent formation of less tar and coke and easier up-scaling for industrial applications. However, there are still some technical barriers to overcome the application of the SCWG process at an industrial scale such as control of char formation, inhibition of corrosion of the reactor due to the salt precipitation in case real biomass feedstock is used, identification of optimum operating conditions and design of the auxiliary equipment. Thus, batch reactors have been used in many experimental studies to examine reaction kinetics, mechanisms, and pathways, as well as to reveal the effect of reaction parameters taking into account the fact that continuous reactors are more complicated and also expensive to construct [58]. Huang et al. studied SCWG of glucose in a tubular quartz batch reactor and analyzed the effect of operating conditions such as the presence of catalyst, residence time, reaction temperature and feed concentration on the gasification efficiency and hydrogen yield using in-situ generated nickel catalyst. The maximum carbon and hydrogen gasification efficiencies were found to be 56.84% and 39.39% with 17.86% of H2 and 39.48% CO2 by mole in the gas product using 10%wt. of glucose, at 500 °C temperature and 300 s of residence time. No information regarding liquid and solid product yields and compositions has been reported [59]. Gokkaya et al. gasified white poplar sawdust and hemicellulose isolated from the poplar in SCW in a batch system and investigated the effect of temperature and catalyst (10% wt. K2CO3) on the yields of gas, liquid and solid products as well as the gas and liquid product compositions. They reported that the maximum gas yield (84.7%) could be achieved at 600 °C by using isolated hemicellulose component of the poplar in the presence of 10% wt. K2CO3 with less amount of residual (tar+char) product. Moreover, the gas product consisted of 38.2% H2 and 31.9% CO2, 27.7% CH4 and trace amounts of CO and C2-C4 gases. The maximum H2 amount for extracted hemicellulose and poplar were found to be 22 mol/kg and 18 mol/kg, respectively, which indicated that the gasification of real biomass with desired composition was a challenging achievement task due to its composition resulted from the presence of salts, ash and protein and their potential interactions during the complex gasification process [60]. Cao et al. carried out SCWG of lignin and cellulose at 500 and 600 °C in a batch reactor over a novel CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. They reported that the presence of catalyst was more pronounced at 500 °C, however the highest H2 yields of lignin and cellulose were obtained as 20.39 and 19.39, respectively at 600 °C. They also interpreted the effect of catalyst on the liquid composition comprehensively [61]. Chen et al. conducted a parametric study for the SCWG of food waste in the presence of functional ionic liquid in a micro quartz batch reactor with an aim to achieve complete gasification and investigated the effect of reaction parameters such as temperature, residence time and feedstock concentration on the gasification yield. They observed almost complete gasification of food waste at 850 °C reaching a gasification efficiency of 118% with H2 as the major gas component. They also reported that even though the gasification efficiency had its maximum value (118%) at the highest oxidant concentration, the hydrogen yield at this condition was observed as low as 11.8 mol H2/kg biomass [62]. Su et al. gasified food waste that consisted of cabbage, chicken, rice and banana peel in SCW at varying reaction temperatures using Ni/Al2O3 catalyst promoted with different loading levels of lanthanum (La). According to the results, the highest H2 yield per kg of biomass was found to be 8.03 mol at 480 °C when 9 wt% of La is loaded on to the catalyst [63]. Nanda et al. carried out SCWG of waste cooking oil in a tubular fixed bed batch reactor at varying temperatures (375–675 °C), feed concentrations (25–40 wt%), reaction time (15–60 min) and catalysts (Ru/Al2O3, Ni/Si-Al2O3, K2CO3 and Na2CO3) to investigate their influence on gas yield. They demonstrated that the highest H2 yield (10.2 mol/kg) was achieved when Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was used due to catalyzing water-gas shift reactions, whereas the highest CH4 yield (8.15 mol/kg) was obtained when Ni/Si-Al2O3 was used due to the methanation and hydrogenation reactions. They also proposed a reaction mechanism based on the composition of the liquid product analyzed [64]. As seen in the recent literature highlighted herein, this topic has received a great attention by the researchers not only using model compounds that mimic real biomass but also real biomass having different natures in the evaluation of significant parameters on the SCWG process. Finally, the present study provides better outcomes as summarized in Table 6 and demonstrates that fruit pulp as received from the factory could be utilized as an energetically biomass feedstock for hydrogen production with high yield."
10,Conclusions,"In the present paper, experimental studies were conducted in a batch reactor to determine the suitable reaction parameters for supercritical water gasification of fruit pulp in the presence of KOH. Experimental results show that temperature has a major effect upon hydrogen formation from fruit pulp; at 600 °C even without catalyst, 16.0 mol H2/kg biomass was obtained. When the temperature was increased from 400 °C to 600 °C, the H2 yield increased 8.4 fold; from 2.4 to 20.2 mol/kg biomass in the presence of KOH. Also, at high temperatures, the yields of CO2, CH4, CO and C2-C3 hydrocarbons were small compared to that of H2, which indicated that supercritical water gasification of fruit pulp has potential for H2 production. Further studies demonstrated that the biomass concentration had a negative effect on H2 production. By decreasing biomass ratio from 10% to 2.5%, there was an eight times decrease in H2 yield. Also, it was demonstrated that decreasing the biomass ratio could shorten the suitable reaction time from 60 min to 30 min due to the promotion of free radical reactions. KOH was effective for improving H2 yield by water-gas shift reaction, in which CO2 was removed as K2CO3 at high temperatures and 10% by wt. KOH was found to be the most suitable ratio to obtain the highest H2 yield (32.1 mol/kg biomass). The calorific value of the fruit pulp on a dry basis was determined as 16.71 MJ/kg, while after gasification the gas mixture produced with the calorific value of 35.4 MJ/kg after 30 min reaction time in the presence of 10% by wt. KOH. These results suggest that fruit pulp as received from the factory without any drying process could be utilized as an energetically biomass feedstock to produce valuable energy in the form H2-rich syngas."
