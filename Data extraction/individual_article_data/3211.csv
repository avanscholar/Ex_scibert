0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is one of the more demanded synthetic energy carrier [1,2]. However, since the production, packaging, storage, transfer and delivery of hydrogen gas are extremely energy consuming, hydrogen technology is currently more expensive than conventional energy sources and therefore alternatives to its production should be considered. Biohydrogen is expected to play a major role in the future since hydrogen can be produced chemically, thermochemically, biologically, biochemically, biophotolytically, etc. [3]. The use of wastewaters in this process will be even more fruitful. The use of wastewaters could be very advantageous because it will help simultaneously to clean wastewaters before discharge in nature and at the same time to produce fuels. Biomass gasification, pyrolysis, reforming, oxidation processes, hydrolysis also often require high energetic consumption. Contrarily, biological routes (fermentation, biological water-gas shift, and photosynthesis) or photocatalysis may produce hydrogen more advantageously. Biologic and fermentative biohydrogen from sugar was already reported in literature [4–6]. Biomass that is targeted in these applications is a side product from agriculture, lumber industry, food industry or a waste resulting from human activities. Glycerol (a side product of biodiesel production) [7–9], glucose, sucrose [9], starch and wood [10], sewage sludge [11], and organic pollutants as alcohols (methanol, ethanol) or acids (formic or oxalic acids) usually act as sacrificial agents [12–15] and were already used as sources for photo-production of biohydrogen. Glucose and cellulose were also processed as hydrogen source using homogeneous catalytic processes [16]. The semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted much interest since Fujishima and Honda (1972) [17] reported the photocurrent generation using semiconductor electrodes. The most widely used semiconductor is titanium dioxide. It has high photostability and oxidative power, low cost and is nontoxic [18], but a major drawback is the fact that TiO2 does not appreciably absorb wavelengths above 370nm. This semiconductor has a band-gap at about 3.2eV [18] and the excitation with visible light is not possible, only about 3–5% of solar light could be absorbed. Modifying of the semiconductor with metal or non-metal ions represent a viable choice to improve TiO2 efficiency in the visible range of the spectrum in order to expand the applicability of this semiconductor as photocatalyst [19–22]. Recently, Chambers provided new evidences that only anatase is effective to the doping effect [23,24]. Photocatalytic generation of hydrogen is based mainly on water splitting reactions. TiO2 represents the base catalyst, and its activity is “tuned” by metal or non-metal doping, addition of electron donors or sensitization [25–29]. Recent advances in this direction showed indeed an important progress, gold deposited on TiO2 catching a great interest as an efficient photocatalyst [30–33]. Hydrogen photo-production using gold catalysts was reported in literature [34,35]. It was found that the activity depends on the preparation route, the quantity of deposited Au and the calcination temperature. The aim of this paper is to present results for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water using as sacrificial electron donor aqueous sugar solutions that can be considered as models for sugar industry wastewaters, developing for this purpose promoted-TiO2 as photocatalysts. In the present work we have considered TiO2 modified by (i) dispersing titania on a high-surface silica, (ii) modifying titania with metals exhibiting different oxidation states, (iii) doping titania with non-metals like N or S, and (iv) depositing Au nanoparticles. Therefore, the purpose of the present work is to prepare a series of titania photocatalysts to test their activity for hydrogen production from water using sugar as sacrificial electron donor. Aimed at this, we have considered the deposition of transition metal ion or gold nanoparticles on titania dispersed on high-surface area silica. The advantage of using silica as support is their easy availability and relative low cost combined with high-surface area that provides a high concentration of active sites. Alternatively, we have also tested conventional P-25 TiO2 doped with non-metals (N and S). The presence of metal ion or non-metal dopant generally expands the light absorption spectrum of the titania photocatalyst into the visible region and increases the efficiency of converting light into chemical energy [36]."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of the photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of the photocatalysts Four types of photocatalysts were prepared: (i) mixed TiO2–SiO2 catalyst, (ii) a series of TiO2–SiO2 modified with metals with different oxidation states (Cr2+, Mn4+ and V5+) and with non-metals (N and S), (iii) a series of non-metal (N and S) doped and metal modified TiO2, and (iv) Au deposited on TiO2–SiO2 and TiO2. 5%TiO2/SiO2, 1%Mn/5%TiO2/SiO2, 1%V2/5%TiO2/SiO2, 1%Cr/5%TiO2/SiO2, 1%N–5%TiO2/SiO2 1%S–5%TiO2/SiO2 and 1%N+1%S–5%TiO2/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of silica with titanium precursor followed by a re-impregnation procedure with a metal salt or urea/thiourea. The silica support used for this study was Cabosil M-5 (Supelco). In the first step, a 5 wt% TiO2/SiO2 supported oxide was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of 1g of SiO2 with the minimum quantity of an ethanol solution containing the desired amount of titanium iso-propoxide (Ti(i-OC3H7)4, Aldrich, 97%). After impregnation at room temperature, the sample was kept overnight under a N2 flow and then it was subsequently dried at 393K for 2h and calcined at 773K in flowing air for 5h. In the second step the 5 wt% TiO2/SiO2 support was impregnated with a second species leading to 1 wt% M/5 wt% TiO2/SiO2 modified catalysts (M=Cr, Mn and V). The impregnation was carried out using the required amount of ethanol solutions of 15 wt% transition metal salts (Cr(III) acetylacetonate, Mn(III) acetylacetonate, and VO(OC3H7)3). The removal of the solvent was carried out by conventional drying, first at room temperature for 24h, and after that at 393K for 2h. Removal of residual organics and thermal stabilization of the materials was carried out by calcination for 5h at 773K in air atmosphere. The doping of the TiO2–SiO2 with nitrogen or/and sulfur was carried out using a solution of calculated amount of urea, thiourea or both, respectively (98% reagent grade, Aldrich). The solution was added to the TiO2–SiO2 suspension in the 1:1 weight ratio. The mixture was sonicated for 10min for better homogenization and then was gently dried in vacuum (40°C) using a rotator evaporator. After that, the solid was thermally treated for 5h at 400°C. A yellowish solid was obtained in each case. Modification of TiO2 Degussa P25 followed the same procedure as for TiO2–SiO2. The 0.5 wt% Au/5 wt% TiO2/SiO2 and 0.5 wt% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared by the deposition–precipitation method; 1g of 5 wt% TiO2/SiO2 or TiO2 support was added to an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (0.2M) previously adjusted at pH≈8.5 with a NaOH solution (0.2M). The slurry was maintained at 75°C, under vigorous stirring for 5h. After stirring, the sample was filtered, washed with deionised water till elimination of chloride verified by titration with AgNO3, and then dried under vacuum at 80°C for 48h."
3,Characterization of the photocatalysts,"2.2 Characterization of the photocatalysts N and S content in the doped TiO2 was determined by chemical analysis using a Perkin–Elmer CHNSO analyzer (combustion elemental analysis) and after dissolving the solid with a mixture of 40% aqueous solution of 0.1:1 of HF and HNO3 at 60°C and determining the concentration of the elements by ICP-AES. Surface area of the samples was measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature. Particle size was measured using the laser light scattering technique (LLS) with a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 device having two laser sources (455 and 653nm, respectively). Water was used as suspension media which simulates the reaction conditions. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Schimadzu XRD-7000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å, 40kV, 40mA) at a scanning speed of 0.10degreesmin−1 in the 5–80° 2θ range. Diffuse reflectance optical (DR-UV–Vis) spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Analytik Jena Specord 250 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere for reflectance measurements and Spectralon as the reflectance standard. DR-UV–Vis spectra of the photocatalysts were recorded in reflectance units and were transformed in Kubelka–Munk remission function F(R). The estimation of the band-gap energy was made using the formula E = hc/λ (eV), where h is the Planck constant (4.135×10−15 eVs), c is the speed of light (3×108 ms−1), and λ the absorption threshold value for each sample determined from the spectra. The value of E g, the band-gap of the semiconductor, can be derived from the spectra by plotting (F(R)·hν)2 against hν. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectra were measured with a Thermo Electron Nicolet 4700 FTIR spectrometer with a Smart Accessory for diffuse reflectance measurements. The IR spectra were scanned in the region of 4000–400cm−1 at the resolution of 4cm−1. The final spectra are an accumulation of 400 scans. XPS spectra were recorded at room temperature using SSX-100 spectrometer, Model 206 from Surface Science Instrument. The pressure in the analysis chamber during the analysis was 1.33mPa. Monochromatized Al-Kα radiation (hν =1486.6eV) generated by bombarding the Al anode with an electron gun operated with a beam current of 12mA and acceleration voltage of 10kV has been used. The spectrometer energy scale was calibrated using the Au 4f7/2 peak centered at 83.98eV. Charge correction was made with the C 1s signal of adventitious carbon (C–C or C–H bonds) located at 284.8eV. The atomic surface compositions were calculated using the sensitivity factors provided with the ESCA 8.3 D software, applied to the surface below the corresponding fitted XPS signals. An estimated error of ±0.1eV can be assumed for all measurements."
4,Photogeneration of hydrogen,"2.3 Photogeneration of hydrogen The catalysts were tested in the hydrogen photo-production from sugar solutions. Photocatalytic tests were carried out in closed Pyrex test tubes at room temperature under continuous stirring. The test tubes were purged with nitrogen before irradiation. A 0.5cm3/min flow of nitrogen was passed through the test tube during irradiation and the gas was collected in an inverted burette after passing through a cooling column for water vapor condensation. As irradiation source 200W Ne lamp (F74-765, Tungsram, Hungary) was used. The emission spectrum of the lamp is shown in Fig. 1 . In a typical experiment 0.05g catalyst and 5mL of commercial sugar solutions in water (10 wt%) were used. The total reaction time was 2h, samples being collected every 15min. Collected samples were analyzed using an Agilent Technologies 7890 A Gas-Chromatograph with a TCD detector (nitrogen as carrier gas at a flow of 5mL/min) equipped with a 19091J-413 Agilent Column (30m HP-5×0.320mm×0.23μm film thickness) operating in isothermal conditions at 40°C. The error of analysis is less than ±5%. The quantity of hydrogen generated after irradiation was calculated by automatically taking samples of 5μL from the gas collecting burette and analyzing by GC. Quantification of the hydrogen peak was made by calibrating the GC system with standard mixtures of 5% H2–95% He and 10% H2–90% He from Linde. The content of hydrogen was calculated after the correction of the pressure to STP conditions. CO2 analysis was carried out with the same type of GC using an INNOWAX capillary column. MS analysis (Thermo Scientific VG PROLAB Benchtop QMS) in the range m/z from 2 to 44 was also used to monitor the resulting gaseous products."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the photocatalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the photocatalysts The elemental analysis of N doped TiO2 revealed a content of approximately 1 wt% nitrogen or sulfur (Table 1 ). Approximately 1 wt% of doping ion was found also in the TiO2/SiO2 support. The particles size determined in conditions resembling the photocatalytic tests showed a very similar distribution for both types of supports (Table 2 ). However, TiO2–SiO2 and TiO2 exhibit very different surface areas (Table 3 ). As obviously, silica based materials exhibit a much larger surface area. Pore size distribution showed the presence of larger pores in the case of TiO2–SiO2 photocatalysts. Accordingly to the large size of the pores the deposition of the metal or of N, S species does not cause a diminution of the pores. On the contrary, in the case of the metals a slight increase of the pores has been detected most probably as a consequence of a chemical interaction of the generated oxides with the support (Fig. 2 ). XRD patterns for the series of TiO2/SiO2 photocatalysts containing modifiers (Fig. 3 ) correspond to the amorphous support. Except the peak in the range 2θ =15–30° assigned to the amorphous silica, no other reflection plane has been identified due to the well dispersion of TiO2 and of the modifying species on the support. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the non-metal doped TiO2 photocatalysts. The samples presented the same diffraction pattern as for the starting TiO2. Anatase is the majority phase. The deposition of the metal species led to very similar patterns that indicate a high dispersion of the respective oxides on the support. The 5%TiO2/SiO2 catalyst presents a threshold at 397nm corresponding to an energy gap of 3.15eV, which is characteristic of the transition between the valence and conduction band of TiO2 particles. The DR-UV–Vis spectra of 1%V/5%TiO2/SiO2 sample exhibits an absorption threshold at 478nm (2.6eV), with a shift that is presumably due to the superposition of the TiO2 and VO x interband absorptions. The spectra of the 1%Mn/5%TiO2/SiO2 and 1%Cr/5%TiO2/SiO2 samples present also shifts corresponding to a E g of 2.8eV and 2.2eV, respectively, due to intercalation of doping metals in the TiO2 framework. In addition to the characteristic absorption edges of TiO2, new absorption bands were observed in the DR-UV–Vis spectra which can be attributed to the presence of dispersed metal oxides on the surface of the support and contribute to the response of the catalysts in the visible region of the incident light. The DR-UV–Vis spectra of N-, S- and N,S-TiO2/SiO2 samples (not shown) show the characteristic red-shift of the absorption edges of TiO2 due to the doping effect. The TiO2 optical band-gap decreased with 0.6eV, 0.9eV and 0.8eV, respectively (Fig. 5 ). For the 0.5%Au/TiO2/SiO2 catalyst, although the Au deposition led to a slight increase of the band-gap of the support (3.5eV), a new absorption band in the visible region with a maximum at about 550nm is present that is also responsible for the pink-violet color of the catalyst. This band is the result of the surface plasmon resonance originating from the collective oscillations of the electrons on the surface of the gold nanoparticles. Visible light is absorbed by gold nanoparticles due to the surface plasmon resonance which leads to a photoexcited state of the gold nanoparticles followed by the transfer of the electrons into TiO2 [37]. The P25 titania exhibits the typical absorption of anatase TiO2 with an intense transition in the UV region of the spectrum due to an electron transition from the valence band to the conduction band of the semiconductor (3.07eV) (Fig. 6 ). The spectra of N-TiO2, S-TiO2 and N,S-TiO2 photocatalysts clearly show the characteristic absorption of TiO2 in the UV region and a shift in the absorption threshold towards higher wavelengths. These correspond to a band-gap of 3.0eV, 2.97eV and 2.97eV for N-TiO2, S-TiO2 and N,S-TiO2, respectively. These values are consistent with the band-gap values reported in literature for B and N – doped TiO2 [9]. The shift in absorption threshold correlates very well with the yellow color of the materials. The S doped catalyst also presents a second absorption at about 542nm. For the catalysts modified with metals, a decrease of the band-gap values to 2.67eV, 2.76eV and 4.48eV for V, Mn and Cr modified catalysts, respectively, can be observed. Again, deposition of gold led to an increase of the band-gap to 3.42eV. The catalyst with gold presented the characteristic plasmon absorption (Fig. 5). The other metal-modified samples exhibit the absorption bands attributed to the surface dispersed corresponding oxides (not shown in figure). The DRIFT spectra of the modified samples are also associated with the nature of the support. For example, Fig. 7 shows the DRIFT spectra of the 5%TiO2/SiO2 and 1%M/5%TiO2/SiO2 (M=Cr, Mn, V) photocatalysts. Except 1%Cr/5%TiO2/SiO2, all spectra exhibit a sharp strong band at 3744cm−1 due to stretching vibrations of the isolated (non-interacting) surface silanols. The same groups are exhibiting a band at about 1630cm−1. A broad band in the low frequency side (3300–3550cm−1) due to hydrogen bonded silanols is also present for all samples. The low wavenumber region of spectra, where the stretching modes of Si–O–M groups are expected to occur [38], do not show remarkable differences between the samples, differences being observed only in intensity of the bands. Bonds like Si–O–Ti (∼980cm−1), Ti–O–Ti (1300–1320cm−1) or Si–O–Si (1200, 820cm−1) are evident from the spectra. The impregnation of base support with metals does not imply a modification of the titania–silica support which is in agreement with the low metal loadings and the XRD data collected for the same samples. Fig. 8 presents the DRIFT spectra of the non-metal TiO2 doped photocatalysts. Two bands are presented around 3690 and 1630cm−1, respectively, assigned to stretching vibrations of the isolated surface titanols. A broad band in the low frequency side (3300–3550cm−1) due to hydrogen bonded titanols is also present for all samples. Bands assigned to N–H or NO as consequence of nitridation are observed at 1500–1550cm−1. For S-TiO2 and N,S-TiO2 a relatively broad and intense band (shoulder) can be observed at around 1200cm−1 which can be assigned to SC or SO, respectively. No bands assigned to S–H can be observed, possibly due to the very high intensity of the titanol band. These features are also common for the TiO2/SiO2 support modified with non-metals. XPS analysis provided additional information about the modification of titania with the investigated metal and non-metal elements. Table 2 compiles the surface M/Ti (M=Fe, Mn, V) XPS atomic ratios and the corresponding binding energies of the Si 2p, Ti 2p3/2, O 1s, and M (M=Fe, Mn, and V) levels obtained. For all the samples the binding energy of the Ti 2p3/2 level corresponds to the Ti4+ oxidation state [39]. No other multiple Ti components or chemical shifts appear, suggesting that doping does not influence significantly the local chemistry of the host Ti atoms in the TiO2 phase. Binding energies of the doped metals correspond to Cr3+ [40], Mn3+ [41] and V5+, respectively [42] independently of the support nature. In the case of Au containing catalysts, shifting to lower eV values compared to 84eV of metallic Au can be explained as caused by a negative charge transfer from the framework oxygen of TiO2 to the metallic gold [43]. The position of the Au 4f7/2 peak at values lower than 84eV confirms the fact that Au is found as metallic Au0, cationic Au occurring at values higher than 84eV. The B.E. observed for the samples containing nitrogen N 1s can be attributed to the interstitial nitrogen [44]. Two XPS peaks in the S 2p core level region have been observed for S-doped samples. One with binding energies of 160–162eV which can be attributed to the formation of Ti–S bonds as O2− is replaced by S2− and one at about 168eV which can be the evidence of S6+ and S4+ species [45]. These sulfur-oxidized species can originate in SO2 and SO3 which were generated from the reaction between TiO2 and sulfur which might be adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 [46]. The XPS atomic ratios given in Table 2 correlate very well with the chemical analysis of the compounds doped with non-metals which demonstrate the homogeneity of the catalysts doped with non-metals. Instead, for the samples modified with metals, a higher M/Ti ratio than the theoretical one demonstrates only a partial doping of the catalysts and the formation of corresponding oxides on the surface of the support. This correlates with the narrowing of the optical band-gap of TiO2 accompanied by the apparition of new adsorption bands in the DR-UV–Vis spectra."
7,Photogeneration of hydrogen,"3.2 Photogeneration of hydrogen In order to prove the photocatalytic process, prior the effective tests, blank controls were performed with the same reaction systems in dark or in the absence of sucrose. No hydrogen was generated in these conditions. For establishing an adsorption–desorption equilibrium the samples were left under stirring in dark for 15min and after that the lamp was switched on. The quantity of hydrogen produced for the TiO2/SiO2 based catalysts (Fig. 9 ) was very similar for the 1%M/5%TiO2/SiO2 and 0.5%Au/5%TiO2/SiO2 and follows the order 1%V/5%TiO2/SiO2 >0.5%Au/5%TiO2/SiO2 >1%Mn/5%TiO2/SiO2 >1%Cr/5%TiO2/SiO2 ≫5%TiO2/SiO2. It can be proposed that this order should be a reflection of the different ability of metal ions to trap and transfer electrons and holes, according to the following two equations [25]: (1) M z + ( M = doping ion ) + h ν → M ( z + 1 ) + + e − ( conduction band ) (2) M z + + h ν → h ν → M ( z + 1 ) + + h + ( valence band ) Electron or hole transfer between metal ions and TiO2 can alter electron-hole recombination, the metal ion acting as a trap: (3) M z + + e − → M ( z − 1 ) + (4) M z + + h + → M ( z + 1 ) + M z +/M(z−1)+ energy levels must be less negative than that of the lower edge of the conduction band in TiO2. In the same time, the energy of M z +/M(z+1)+ must be less positive than the valence band. As Mn and V ions can trap both electrons and holes, doping with these metal ions can improve TiO2 photocatalytic activity in the production of hydrogen [36]. Cr ion can only trap one type of charge carrier [47] so its activity is lower. In addition vanadium has a larger capability compared to the other metal to coordinate and release oxygen species. In addition to the improved oxidizing and reducing abilities of TiO2, a synergism between the TiO2 and SiO2 phases is necessary. The presence of high-surface silica led to a concentration of target molecules around the active sites that improves the photocatalytic behavior. Although deposition of gold increases the optical band-gap of TiO2–SiO2 support, upon excitation of gold at its surface plasmon electrons can be pumped to titania conduction band promoting charge separation. Interestingly, this high photocatalytic activity of 0.5%Au/1%TiO2/SiO2 was achieved for a composition corresponding to the lowest M/Ti atomic ratio in the catalysts series that is between four and eight times lower than for the other metals (Au/Ti=0.04<Mn/Ti=0.19<Cr/Ti=0.31≈V/Ti=0.32). Doping the TiO2–SiO2 support with non-metals led to catalysts with a poorer activity. Thus, non-metal doping produces materials that exhibit in average an activity about four times smaller than that of the metal modified samples. The photocatalysts 1%M/5%TiO2/SiO2 and 0.5%Au/TiO2/SiO2 perform also similarly in the photo-production of hydrogen as those obtained by non-metal doping of P-25, in spite of their much higher Ti content of the later. Fig. 10 shows the hydrogen production of the three anion doped TiO2 tested in the present study. As it can be seen there, doping with S shows a better hydrogen generation rate than the N or N,S doped photocatalysts. According to literature [25], when TiO2 is doped with S, the mixing of S 3p states with the valence band of TiO2 is leading to an increase of the width of the valence band which will lead to a narrower band-gap. The conduction band will remain unchanged. In addition, the presence of an absorption band at 542nm for the S-TiO2 sample suggests a higher efficiency of this photocatalyst for hydrogen production under visible light [48]. At the same time, although the S doping is resulting in a narrower band-gap, the ionic radius of the S is reported to be too large for the intercalation in the TiO2 network [25]. On the other hand, N-doping can cause a narrowing of the band-gap due to the valence band upward shift [49]. At the same time, less oxidizing holes are generated. Since the electrons are responsible for reducing protons in the hydrogen formation process, the performance of the photocatalysts is not affected by the ability to oxidize since the valence band of TiO2 is far more positive than necessary to oxidize most of the sacrificial electron donors. The N-doped TiO2 is able to produce hydrogen, the conduction band being more negative than the hydrogen production energy level. As the energy band-gap downsizes, electron-hole recombination was reported to be faster and for this reason the activity of N-doped TiO2 is reduced respect to that of undoped TiO2 [50] and also lower compared to S-TiO2. The catalysts doped with both anions showed an intermediate activity. Pure TiO2 showed a very low activity compared with the doped samples and this behavior can be associated to its lower response in the visible range of the irradiation source. Comparing the best results in the two series of photocatalysts (i.e. metal and anion doped photocatalysts), although their activity is very similar, the overall best performance was achieved by the S-TiO2, suggesting that the non-metals are somewhat more effective to enhance the photocatalytic activity. This higher activity can be again attributed to the lower population of recombination centers compared with the metals. The same conclusion can be drawn if we consider the ratio between the dopant and the TiO2 phase. On the other hand, considering the two different types of support and strictly the amount of TiO2, it can be assumed that the metal modified catalysts perform better with only 5wt% TiO2 compared with 100% in the case of non-metal containing catalysts, proving a synergism between photocatalytic properties of doped TiO2 and adsorptive properties of silica, conclusion which is supported also by textural data (higher surface areas and larger pores). The role of the support is crucial, TiO2 exhibiting adding positive effect. Literature shows that in the case of visible light irradiation, photocatalytic reactions occur much slower on pure silica compared to titania [51]. In the case of metal doped TiO2–SiO2 a good dispersion of TiO2 is required as we proved that only a small amount of metal is effectively doping titania and the majority of it is present as metal oxide dispersed on the surface of the support. More than that, it was proven that in the case of N-TiO2–SiO2, for example, an increase of the N/Ti ratio has a detrimental effect on the catalytic activity of this material [52] which concludes that an optimal amount of doping element is required. Furthermore, it was observed that in the case of 1%M/5%TiO2/SiO2 catalyst the evolution of hydrogen follows a gradual trend (Fig. 11A) compared with the anion doped materials which have a slow increasing slope followed by an abrupt enhancement of the activity after 75min of irradiation. The particle size of the investigated catalysts was very similar as it was shown in Table 2. However, the surface area of the catalysts deposed on silica was much higher. Thus the deposition of the active species on the silica support provided thus a route in which the exposed surface area was increased. The analytic data may support a tentative mechanism accordingly to which the initial step is the oxidation of the organic alcohol or aldehyde. Water acts as an oxidizing agent. This is, however, in agreement with data reported by other authors [53]. Protons then consume the photogenerated electrons in a conventional reduction leading to the hydrogen gas. The formation of carboxylic acids represents the next step in the degradation of sucrose (if we consider commercial sugar as 100% sucrose). They suffer a decarboxylation accompanied by the release of CO2 (Scheme 1 ). Considering that in our case R is a carbohydrate, the end carbon group is an alcohol which can continue oxidation to total mineralization, the gaseous products should be then only H2 and CO2. The process occurs via oxidation of the organic molecule generating compounds with progressively lower molecular weight and, finally CO2. The above Scheme does not rule out the pathway through photogenerated hydroxyl radicals and formation of water instead of H+ from sucrose. In our case, no other gaseous products were observed. The evolution of CO2 is presented in Fig. 12 . In all cases, the quantity of CO2 collected in the burette was close to the theoretical ratio hydrogen to carbon dioxide (=2) calculated according to the chemical reaction (Eq. (5)): (5) C12H22O11 +13 H2O→24H2 +12 CO2 Interestingly, in the case of metal modified catalysts, the order of CO2 production after 2 hours of irradiation was somewhat modified, the gold containing catalyst exhibiting the highest activity. This can be attributed to the advanced oxidation processes; the possibility that gold nanoparticles are simultaneously acting as catalytic sites favoring oxidation processes is likely."
8,Conclusion,"Metal (Cr, Mn and V) modified, Au nanoparticles supported and non-metal (S, N and S+N) doped TiO2–SiO2 and TiO2 photocatalysts are highly active catalysts for the photogeneration of hydrogen from sugar solutions under UV–visible light irradiation. The results obtained combining XRD, FTIR and DR-UV–Vis provided a characterization of the surface structures on the dispersed samples that serve to correlate the behavior of these materials for hydrogen production. The investigated photocatalysts exhibit narrower band-gap that TiO2 anatase and some have absorption band in the visible region. It was found that doping with non-metals is more effective than doping with metals in the case of TiO2 based photocatalysts and more effective for metals in the case of TiO2–SiO2 based photocatalysts. However, comparing the two supported catalysts the best results were obtained for TiO2 doped with non-metals photocatalysts. This behavior was attributed to the fact the non-metals are less effective in forming recombination centers compared with the metals."
