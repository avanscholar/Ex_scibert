0,Introduction,"With the increasing human activities, fossil fuels, which have caused many serious environmental problems, are difficult to maintain the growing energy demand. Therefore, many research groups have already focused on the clean and renewable energy, such as wind, solar, biomass and hydrogen. In particular, hydrogen, generated by photocatalytic water splitting, has attracted considerable attention as an alternative solution for energy crisis and environmental pollution. The photoelectrochemical hydrogen production was first reported in 1972, in which TiO2 was used as the photoanode material [1]. Since then, photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production using TiO2 has been extensively studied due to its high photocatalytic activity, stability, non-corrosion and nontoxicity. However, several drawbacks hinder its widespread applications, such as the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs and the large electronic band gap (anatase, 3.2eV) [2]. One of the effective methods to overcome the drawbacks is doping nonmetal elements into TiO2, e.g. N, C, S and F [3–7], among which, nitrogen doping shows obvious advantages [8,9] due to the small ionic radius of nitrogen, unique properties of high thermal stability and low recombination centers. Previous studies [3,10,11] have also indicated that narrow optical band gap and high photocatalytic activity can be obtained by doping N into TiO2. So far, many techniques have been developed to synthesize N-doped TiO2, including sol–gel [12,13], hydrothermal method [14], oxidation of titanium nitride [15], pulsed laser deposition [16] and sputtering [17–21], among which TiO2 films deposited by sputtering exhibit uniform composition [22] and facile control of film thickness [23]. In addition, many methods have been proposed to enhance the water splitting by use of TiO2-based materials, such as constructing photoelectrochemical cells (PEC, consist of a single-crystal TiO2 photoanode and a Pt cathode) [1] and p/n-photoelectrolysis cells [24], adjusting pH value [25], adopting particulate photocatalytic system [26], employing NaOH coating [27] and adding cocatalyst (e.g. Pt, Au) [28]. However, there are few reports on using TiO2 films deposited by sputtering to generate hydrogen without the assistance of metal cathode, bias or loading noble metal. In this work, N-doped TiO2 films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering in a mixture of O2, N2 and Ar. The intrinsic properties of the films were investigated by XRD, SEM, AFM, XPS and UV–vis spectrophotometer. Hydrogen production was examined by immersing the as-deposited films into 10% aqueous methanol solution. It is found that the photocatalytic activity of N-doped TiO2 film in water splitting was far higher than that of undoped TiO2 film and even Degussa P25 powders."
1,Experimental,"N-doped TiO2 films were deposited on quartz glass substrates (2×4cm) by RF reactive magnetron sputtering. These substrates were beforehand cleaned, sequentially with acetone, alcohol and de-ionized water, respectively for 20min in the ultrasonic bath. The working gas was a mixture of N2 (99.999% pure), O2 (99.99% pure) and Ar (99.999% pure). The target was a 2-inch-diameter Ti metal plate (99.999% pure). The target-substrate distance was fixed at 70mm and the base vacuum was 5.8×10−3 Pa. Before deposition, the substrate temperature was maintained at 400°C for 2h to degas and the target was pre-sputtered for 30min by argon plasma. Afterwards, working gas was introduced into the chamber through three mass flow controllers and flow rate fixed at 5.0sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute), 3.9sccm, 40sccm for N2, O2 and Ar respectively. The total working pressure was set at 0.3Pa and the RF power was fixed at 130W. The whole deposition process was conducted at 450°C for 4h, during which the substrate rotated around its axis at 8 rotations per minute. Pure TiO2 film was also deposited under the same condition without N2 as reference. The crystalline structure of the as-deposited N-doped TiO2 films was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Model D/Max 2550V, Rigaku, Japan). The thickness and morphology were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM6700F, JEOL, Japan). The surface roughness was estimated by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nanoscope, NS3A-02, Veeco, USA). The transmittance spectra of the films were measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 900, PerkinElmer, USA). The chemical compositions and valence-band spectra were determinated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250, Thermo Scientific, USA). The hydrogen production was examined by the photocatalytic water splitting testing system (CEL-SPH2N, AULTT, China), irradiated by a 300W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, AULTT, China). The total output of the lamp was 50W and only 2.6W of incoming irradiance was obtained below 390nm. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a quartz cell containing 100mL aqueous methanol solution (CH3OH: H2O=1:10 v/v). Before reaction, the as-deposited film was immersed in the aqueous solution and then oxygen was removed by a mechanical pump. The film-lamp distance was fixed at 12cm. The amount of H2 produced was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (SP7800, AULTT, China) using N2 as carrier gas."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Crystalline structure and morphology,"3.1 Crystalline structure and morphology Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of N-doped TiO2 film. Diffraction peaks observed at 2θ =25.28°, 36.95°, 37.88°, 38.55°, 48.05°, 54.09°, 54.88°, 62.67°, and 68.76° correspond well with (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (204), and (116) planes of anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272), indicating that no other phase (e.g., rutile or brookite) is observed and N-doping has little effect on the crystal structure. Nevertheless, it can be seen that N-doping can greatly influence the growth orientation of anatase TiO2 particles. As shown in Fig. 1, the intensities of the (004), (112), (200), and especially (211) peaks become stronger while (101) peak become weaker for the N-doped TiO2 film, compared with those of the undoped TiO2 film. For example, the ratios of I(211) to I(101) [I(211) and I(101) are the intensities of (211) and (101) peaks, respectively] for the N-doped and undoped TiO2 films are 100% and 33%. As is well-known, the surface energies of (001), (112), (100), and (211) planes are all higher than that of (101) plane [29]. Therefore, high photocatalytic activity of N-doped TiO2 film is expected, due to its large percentage of exposed (004), (112), (200), and (211) facets. Fig. 2a illustrates the surface morphology of the N-doped TiO2 film, which exhibits a rough appearance of interconnected TiO2 nodules. Columnar structure is clearly observed from the cross-sectional image, as shown in Fig. 2b. The width of columnar nanograins is ∼40nm, and the thickness of the film is 900nm±20nm. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the film is 20.4nm, measured by AFM (see Fig. 2c)."
4,Chemical composition and optical band gap,"3.2 Chemical composition and optical band gap The chemical states and compositions of the undoped and N-doped TiO2 films were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Before the surface analysis, Ar sputtering for 20s was conducted to remove the contamination. Both the films exhibit Ti-2p3/2 peaks at 458.5eV and O-1s peaks at 529.7eV (data not shown). High-resolution and curve fitting of N-1s XPS spectra of the undoped and N-doped TiO2 films are plotted in Fig. 3 . A pair of N-1s features, located at 396.5eV and 399.8eV respectively, are observed in the N-doped TiO2 sample, while only a broad and weak peak around 399.8eV is shown in the undoped TiO2 sample. In general, the peak at 399.8eV is assigned to either chemisorbed molecular N2 on the surface or interstitial molecular N2 [30], while the peak at 396.5eV is attributed to atomic β-N states (i.e., OTiN bonds) [3,31–33]. As shown in Fig. 3, for the N-doped sample, the peak intensity at 396.5eV is far stronger than the one at 399.8eV, indicates the successful incorporation of N into TiO2 film. The incorporated N is 4.91at.%, estimated from the integrated intensities of the N-1s peak at 396.5eV. It is found that the color of the N-doped TiO2 film was flavogreen while the undoped TiO2 film was pale straw yellow. Since the color of a solid is determined by the position of its absorption edge, the UV–vis absorption spectra of these two samples were further studied. As shown in Fig. 4a, the absorption edge of the undoped TiO2 film ends at about 380nm, while for the N-doped sample, the absorption edge shifts toward the visible light region where a distinct absorption tail (between 400 and 550nm) is observed. The absorbance line dropes sharply from 400 to 450nm and then decreases gently from 450 to 550nm, revealing that the excitation of electrons from localized states in the band gap to unoccupied states in CB may also lead to the absorption of visible light, as well as the transition from VB (valence band) to CB (conduction band). The band gap of the samples was calculated from the absorption spectra by using the Tauc formula [34], as shown in Fig. 4b. The optical band gap is 2.65eV for the N-doped sample and 3.28eV for the undoped TiO2 sample, indicating that N-doping can evidently narrow the band gap of TiO2. This is due to the overlap between nitrogen and oxygen 2p orbital mainly from the N doping according to our XPS data (the specific peak at 395.5eV of N-doped sample). The band-narrowing and the enhanced absorption in the visible-light region (see Fig. 4a) can lead to higher utilization efficiency of sunlight."
5,Hydrogen production,"3.3 Hydrogen production The photocatalytic activity of the N-doped TiO2 film and pure TiO2 film was tested in an aqueous methanol solution under the Xe lamp irradiation for 10h. Two forms of Degussa P25 were tested on the same condition as reference: powder (0.1g of mass, and a magnetic stirrer was employed during the reaction) and film (deposited on a 2×4cm quartz glass substrate by spin-coating; the thickness is about 1μm). Methanol, worked as sacrificial reagent, may also undergo photocatalytic reforming to produce hydrogen, thus a blank experiment was also carried out during which no hydrogen can be detected (data not shown here). As shown in Fig. 5 , the amount of hydrogen produced by N-doped TiO2 film and P25 powder increases almost linearly with the irradiation time, while, in stark contrast, H2 generated is hardly detected by using either the undoped TiO2 film or P25 film. P25 is widely accepted as an excellent photocatalyst with large specific surface area, and there is no doubt that its specific surface area is far larger than that of the N-doping TiO2 film. However, the N-doped TiO2 film exhibits much higher activity (about 601μmol H2 g−1 h−1; Herein, the density of bulk anatase TiO2 was used to estimate the mass of the film; the film thickness is about 900nm) than dispersive P25 powder (about 12μmol H2 g−1 h−1 when a high-dose of 0.1g was adopted). As aforementioned, the presence of nitrogen leads to a red-shift of the absorbance edge and enhanced absorption in the visible-light region. Consequently, the N-doped film can be excited by the visible region of irradiation while P25 (as well as the undoped TiO2 film) can only absorb the UV light. N-doping also leads to the increase of exposed high surface energy facets (See XRD pattern), which means high photocatalytic activity for N-doped TiO2 film. Additionally, N-doped TiO2 can promote the formation energy of oxygen vacancies to decrease dramatically from 4.2eV to 0.6eV [35,36], resulting in the growing of oxygen vacancies in the film. The oxygen vacancies can work as color centers to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Although there exists disagreement that N in the TiO2 lattice can suppress the recombination of the electron–hole pairs, the N-doped TiO2 film shows high photocatalytic activity, about 50 times higher than P25 powder. Furthermore, it should be noticed that cathode, bias and/or noble metal were not employed in this work. Yet the hydrogen production of the film achieves the same level of the powder-form (which owns large specific surface area) N-doped TiO2, or even higher. For instance, the hydrogen production of N-doped TiO2 is about 14 times higher than pure TiO2 in Babu et al.’s work [37], and according to Lin and Shih's research [38], the photocatalytic activity of N-doped TiO2 is just 15 times higher than Degussa P25 powder."
6,Conclusions,"The N-doped TiO2 film was successfully synthesized by RF reactive magnetron sputtering, with anatase phase and a large percentage of exposed (004), (112), (200), and especially (211) facets. The film, about 900nm in thickness, is composed of columnar structures. The optical band gap decreases from 3.28eV (for undoped anatase TiO2 sample) to 2.65eV when 4.91at.% nitrogen is incorporated into the anatase structure. H2 is photocatalytically produced and the amount of H2 increases linearly with the exposure time when immersing this sample into 10% aqueous methanol solution and irradiating under the Xe lamp. The H2 production rate of the N-doped TiO2 film is about 601μmolg−1 h−1, far higher than that of the undoped TiO2 film (H2 evolution was hardly detected) and even dispersive P25 powder (about 12μmol H2 g−1 h−1), which is attributed to the red shift of the absorbance edge and the large percentage of exposed high surface energy facets."
