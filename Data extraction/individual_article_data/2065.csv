0,Introduction,"Biohydrogen is a promising alternative energy source [1]. The hydrogen gas generated in wastewater treatment by biological processes can be used as an alternative energy source. Wastewaters are raw materials that do not incur production costs [2]. Mixed anaerobic cultures obtained from sewage sludge can be used for fermentative hydrogen production because they contain a variety of hydrogen-producing bacteria [3]. Several compounds, such as glucose, hexose isomers and polymers as starch or cellulose, have different production levels of hydrogen per mole of organic substrate, depending on the fermentative pathway and end products. Diverse wastewater from agriculture, wood processing and the paper industry may contain xylose [1,3]. Most of studies are related with glucose, and sucrose as substrate source by mixed cultures and a very little attention have been given to xylose fermentation though it has been reported as a suitable substrate source for biohydrogen production [4]. Xylose is a common and abundant sugar obtained from the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials, in particular, hemicellulose. Hydrolysis of lignocellulose materials produces sugars composed mainly of xylose, which accounts for 35–45% of the total product composition [1]. Fermentative hydrogen production from hexose, glucose and sucrose is well studied [1,5,6–8]. In contrast, fermentative hydrogen production of xylose (i.e. pentose) is less well studied [1,3]. The following xylose degradation pathways may result during the fermentative process of hydrogen gas production: (1) consumption of xylose and generation of acetic acid and (2) consumption of xylose and generation of butyric acid, as described in equations (1) and (2): (1) C 5 H 10 O 5 + 3 H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + 3 CO 2 + 6 H 2 (2) C 5 H 10 O 5 + 2 H 2 O → 1 / 2 CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 3 CO 2 + 5 H 2 The maximum theoretical conversion of xylose to hydrogen is equal to 6 mol of hydrogen per mol of xylose from the acetate degradation pathway. However, the generation of 5 mol of hydrogen per mol of consumed xylose occurs if xylose is converted to butyric acid. Theoretically, the major production of hydrogen previews acetic acid as the final product of the fermentation. In practice, the high production of hydrogen is related to a mixture of fermentation products, such as acetic acid and butyric acid; low hydrogen production is associated with the formation of propionic acid and end products that are less reduced, such as alcohols and lactic acid [9]. The highest production of hydrogen is achieved with higher concentrations of sugars; however these high concentrations can produce an inhibitory effect on cellular growth. There are few studies of hydrogen production from reduced substratum concentrations, which would be compatible with the concentrations of sugar from industrial effluents, such as wood processing and cellulose factories that could be re-used for energy generation [5]. Various inoculum sources (natural soil, anaerobic digestion sludge, wastewater treating plants, domestic landfill, lake sediment and others) have been tested, and their biological hydrogen production efficiencies were confirmed. However, these inocula are predominantly obtained from countries with a temperate climate. There are few studies of hydrogen production using inoculum from tropical countries, such as Brazil. In the present work the inoculum was obtained from a granulated sludge of an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor treating slaughterhouse wastewater (Jaboticabal – Brazil). The main goal of this work was to explore the ability of tropical microorganisms to produce hydrogen by applying low concentrations of xylose and close to the wastewater xylose concentrations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diversity of microbial inoculum purified using molecular biology techniques and to measure the hydrogen gas production in anaerobic batch reactors fed with xylose at four different conditions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Obtained microbial consortium and growth conditions,"2.1 Obtained microbial consortium and growth conditions Hydrogen-producing bacteria were obtained from a granulated sludge of the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor treating slaughterhouse wastewaters (Jaboticabal – Brazil). The biomass was transferred to a mortar and pestle in order to break apart the granules. This cellular suspension was preheated at 90 °C for 15 min in order to inactivate the hydrogen consumers and harvest the spore-forming anaerobic bacteria, such as Clostridium sp. [10]. The pre-treated inoculum (20% v/v) was transferred to the sterile culture medium [11] in flasks of 100 mL under aseptic conditions. The increase in biomass was performed using culture medium [11] formed by nutrient solutions A, B, C and D, sucrose (1800 mg/L), urea (40 mg/L), peptone (1000 mg/L) and 1 mL of vitamin solution, as described in Table 1 . The vitamin solution was composed of p-aminobenzoic acid (40 mg/L) and biotin (10 mg/L) [12]. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 with addition of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. These 100 mL anaerobic flasks had a final reaction volume of 70 mL and a headspace of 30 mL. Flasks were then placed in an atmosphere of He (99.99%) for 5 min and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, without agitation. Then, under aseptic conditions, the purified inoculum (40%) was centrifuged under refrigeration at 8500 rpm and 3 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was suspended in culture medium (solutions A, B, C and D, peptone (1000 mg/L), urea (40 mg/L), 1.0 mL of vitamin solutions and xylose (1800 mg/L). The pH was adjusted to 5.5 with addition of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide."
3,Operation of the batch reactors,"2.2 Operation of the batch reactors The reactor preparation was performed as follows. The reactivated biomass was submitted to successive washes and centrifuged under refrigeration at 8500 rpm and 3 °C for 10 min. The pellet was re-suspended in a new culture medium with the following composition: medium [11] with addition of urea, peptone, vitamin solution [12], as previously described and xylose, respectively, to the four conditions (Table 1). The pH was adjusted to 5.5. The culture medium was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane in a filtration system that was sterilized in an autoclave (121 °C, 1 atm, 20 min). The reactors were submitted to a He (99.99%) atmosphere for 20 min after the distribution of the solutions. They were then capped with butyl rubber stoppers, wrapped and kept at 37 ± 1 °C, without agitation. In this study anaerobic batch reactors were used in triplicate in four different conditions of xylose concentrations: (1) 630.0 mg/L; (2) 1341.0 mg/L; (3) 1848.0 mg/L and (4) 3588.0 mg/L, according to Table 1. The inoculum comprised 20% of the total reaction volume, which was composed of the microbial consortium obtained from the heat treated sludge. Conditions (1), (2) and (3) were prepared with 1000 mL of reaction medium and 1000 mL of headspace with He gas in order to guarantee the maintenance of the anaerobic conditions. In condition (4) there was a 2000 mL reaction medium volume and 3000 mL of headspace and was otherwise similar to the previous assays. This change of volume and headspace was necessary to prevent the gas produced from popping up the reactor because the xylose concentration was higher in this condition."
4,Chemical and chromatographic analyses,"2.3 Chemical and chromatographic analyses The hydrogen content in the biogas was determined by gas chromatography (GC 2010 Shimadzu) using a thermal conductivity detector and argon as the carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector, detector and column were kept at 30 °C, 200 °C and 230 °C, respectively. Volatile acid and alcohol concentrations were measured by gas chromatography using a GC 2010 Shimadzu, equipped with a flame ionization detector, a COMBI-PAL headspace autosampler system (AOC 5000) and an HP-INNOWAX column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm of film thickness) [5]. The xylose concentrations were determined by a colorimetric method [13,14]. The volatile suspended solid concentrations (VSS) and pH values were measured as described previously [15]."
5,Cellular growth analysis,2.4 Cellular growth analysis Cellular growth was monitored by optical density at 600 nm (OD600) [15]. The cellular mass was expressed as volatile suspended solids (VSS g/L) and was calculated by equation (4): (4) VSS = 0 . 7436 ∗ABS 600 + 0 . 0146
6,Experimental data fitting,2.5 Experimental data fitting The experimental data were fit to the mean values obtained from the triplicates of the reactors using Microcal Origin® 5.0 software. The maximum specific activities of hydrogen gas production were obtained by non-linear sigmoidal adjustment of the Boltzman function. The maximum xylose consumption velocity was verified by the major angular coefficient generated from the screened lines between the points representing the experimental xylose concentrations in relation to time.
7,Microscopic analyses,2.6 Microscopic analyses Morphological characteristics of the microorganisms were monitored by microscopy using an Olympus BX60-FLA with the software Image Pro-Plus.
8,16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis,"2.7 16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis 2.7.1 Nucleic acid extraction Nucleic acid extractions were performed following the procedure of Griffiths et al. (2000) [16] modified with a direct method with glass beads and a mixture of phenol: chloroform: buffer (1:1:1 v/v) addition. A segment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using eubacterial primers 27F (5′ – AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG – 3′) and 1110R (5′ - GGG TTG CGC TCG TTG - 3′) [17]. The PCR products were purified using a kit, GFX PCR DNA & Gel Band (GE Healthcare), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.7.2 Cloning and determination of the 16S rDNA sequence Samples of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) products (16S rRNA) were cloned into the plasmid vector pGEM (Promega Easy Vector System I) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The clones were randomly selected and amplified by PCR. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on an automated ABI 310 PRISM sequencer (Dye terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applied Biosystems, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions using an M13 forward primer (5′-GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA G-3′) [18]. 2.7.3 Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences The nucleotide sequences were processed and they were aligned with the Seqman program (Lasergene DNAstar package) for removal of signals from the vector and low quality bases. The sequences aligned were compared with the 16S rRNA sequences of organisms represented in the Genbank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for a phylogenetic identity analysis. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences were performed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis 3.1 (MEGA 3.1) software [19]. Evolutionary distances were based on the Kimura model [20] and tree reconstruction, on the neighbor-joining method with bootstrap values calculated from 500 replicate runs, using the routines included in the MEGA software."
9,Results and discussion,"The conditions of pre-treatment and pH 5.5 for the inoculum favored the maintenance of the rod and endospore-forming bacteria in the microbial consortium. Chen et al., 2005 [21] also observed rod and endospore-forming bacteria using inoculum from effluent sludge pre-treated at 80 ̊C for 30 min during the operation of the continuous stirred tank reactor applied to hydrogen bioproduction (7.3 L/h/L of H2 from sucrose-based synthetic wastewater). The addition of peptone to the nutritional environment [22] favored the growth of the bacteria that produces hydrogen [5]. Therefore, the conditions favored the permanence of the microbial consortium, even after changing the organic substrate to xylose. From the cloning and sequencing of fragments of the 16S rRNA, it was found that the gene microbial consortium contained 56 clones. However, some clones (4, 9, 13, 17, 29, 30, 32, 36, 38, 45, 46, 48, 50, 52 and 54) were not incorporated into the phylogenetic analysis because they had insufficient numbers of nucleotides (<180 nucleotides) for comparison with the database (NCBI). The identified clones are described in Table 2 . Among the clones analyzed, 57% were listed as belonging to the Clostridium genus, 30% were listed as belonging to Burkholderia, 8% were listed as belonging to Klebsiella and 5% corresponded to uncultivated bacteria. Most of the bacteria belonging to the Burkholderia genus are commonly found in soil, water and plant roots and are associated with the fungi mycelium [23]. These bacteria, which are Gram negative rods, are utilized in bioremediation processes. In addition to toxic compounds such as organophosphate insecticides, also benzene, toluene, xylene, phenol and chlorophenols [24] were degraded by this species [24]. There are no reports associating these bacteria with H2 production, but they are known to degrade sugars such as sucrose [4] and xylose [25]. Clones 3, 7, 20, 21, 22, 27, 34, 37, 43, 44 and 53 were identified as strains of Burkholderia cepacia (similarity 99%), which is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium associated with plant roots that can use substrates such as sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose [26] to generate acetic acid [27]. Therefore, the emergence of Burkholderia sp. and B. cepacia bacteria were probably favored by the presence of xylose and peptone, and they were involved in acetic acid generation. Clones 8, 18 and 28 showed 99% similarity with Klebsiella pneumoniae. These bacteria are gram-negative, nitrogen-fixing and facultative anaerobes [28] that are recognized in the literature as to generate hydrogen gas [29]. Solomon et al. (1995) [30] observed cell growth of K. pneumoniae in anaerobic batch fed with glycerol (40 g/L), basal medium plus yeast extract (1 g/L), pH 7.0 at 33 °C. Chen et al. (2006) [28] studied the glucose metabolism of K. pneumoniae cells under anaerobic conditions and observed that H2 generation was mainly associated with nitrogenase activity. Clones 5, 11, 33, 47, 55 were identified as Clostridium sp. with 96% similarity. Most studies describe Clostridium species as gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria that are responsible for the anaerobic bioproduction of hydrogen and they can survive at a pH of 4.0 [31,32]. They can produce hydrogen gas, organic acids (mainly butyric acid [29]) and alcohols from carbohydrates and peptones [22]. These bacteria can metabolize carbohydrates, alcohols, amino acids, purines, steroids and other compounds. They show versatile metabolism and can be found in marine sediments at various depths of the ocean, thermophilic environments and in the intestinal tract of animals [32]. Some species fix atmospheric nitrogen, while others carry out fermentative metabolism. Clone 24 showed 99% similarity with Clostridium aciditolerans, which are gram positive anaerobes that can form endospores under adverse conditions. The nucleotide sequence was similar to that deposited in the NCBI database by Lee et al. (2007) [32], who had isolated their sample from wetland sediment that received effluent sulfate. Optimum growth was observed in the range between pH 4.5 and 8.9 at 35 °C. They were able to use different carbon sources, such as meat extract, peptone, sucrose and xylose. There was no growth under aerobic or autotrophic conditions. In microscopic analysis, a predominance of rods with endospores was observed. Clones 2, 6, 15, 23, 25, 26, 35, 39, 42, 49 and 56 had 97% similarity to the Clostridiaceae family. These sequences were similar to the sequence deposited in the NCBI database by Satoh et al. (2002) [33], who isolated anaerobic acidogenic bacteria from the roots of rice plants. Clones 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 31 and 40 showed 96% similarity to uncultivated bacteria belonging to the Clostridiaceae family. These sequences were similar those present in soil samples from rice fields in Italy [34], with the predominant members of the community belonging to the Clostridiaceae family; these bacteria were involved in the degradation of waste polymer from rice plants. Clones that were similar to uncultivated bacterium (clone 1) and uncultivated soil bacteria (clone 51) were also found. The knowledge of microorganisms in the environment is predominantly based on pure laboratory cultures [35]. However, less than 1% of bacteria from the different ecosystems has been studied and identified [36]. Therefore, we expected to obtain sequences similar to uncultivated bacteria. Fig. 1 presents the consensus phylogenetic tree obtained with primers for the bacterial domain from the cloning and sequencing of the microbial consortium used in the anaerobic reactors fed with xylose for the production of hydrogen gas. The coefficients of similarity observed between the clones and the NCBI database ranged from 95 to 99% and indicated the presence of phylogenetically-related species, based on the evaluation of partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene. The known sequences of Clostridium butyricum (FJ424480.1) and Salmonella typhimurium (NC006815) were added. The anaerobic reactors fed with xylose in the four conditions studied had different hydrogen production characteristics. Fig. 2 shows the hydrogen gas production in the anaerobic reactors. The conditions (1) 630 mg xylose/L and (2) 1341 mg xylose/L showed an 18 h lag phase in H2 production. The conditions imposed in this case favored the production of H2 after 18 h of operation. In contrast, the conditions (3) 1848 mg xylose/L and (4) 3588 mg xylose/L presented the lag phase H2 production at 147 h and 191 h of operation, respectively. The maximum H2 generation was equal to 1463.0 μmol/L with 61 h of operation and 4039.5 μmol/L with 151 h for conditions (1) and (2), respectively. The maximum H2 specific production rate was 1312.2 μmol H2/g.VSS in 18 h and 1772.3 μmol H2/g.VSS in 18 h, at conditions (1) and (2) respectively. On the other hand, for conditions (3) and (4), it was verified that the maximum H2 generation was 13,443.4 μmol/L and 12,882.9 μmol/L with 197 h and 293 h operation, respectively. The maximum H2 specific production rates were 2106.8 μmol H2/g VSS in 186 h and 1928.5 μmol H2/g VSS in 269 h, respectively. Table 3 summarizes the results of the four conditions studied. Under the conditions (1) 630.0 mg/L xylose and (2) 1341.0 mg/L xylose we observed the same microbial growth behavior with a maximum of 0.10 g VSS/L, but in different operation times 55 h and 40 h, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3 . The conditions (3) 1848 mg/L xylose and (4) 3588 mg/L xylose favored higher microbial growth than conditions (1) and (2) (0.19 VSS g/L and 0.21 VSS g/L, respectively). The xylose concentrations imposed were not inhibitory to the biomass. The conditions studied did not have a lag phase in the growth of biomass (Fig. 3). Although the initial concentrations of the tests were different, this fact did not cause toxicity to the microbial consortium generating H2 in the anaerobic reactors. Reactors operated with sucrose in similar concentrations to those applied in anaerobic reactors fed with xylose were observed to have a lag phase in microbial growth for the testing conditions 1184 mg sucrose/L, 1816 mg sucrose/L and 4126 mg sucrose/L [4]. The xylose consumption showed different behavior for the experiment, as illustrated in Fig. 4 . It was noted that for conditions (1), (2), (3) and (4), 98%, 97%, 97% and 97% of the xylose was consumed in 127 h; 175 h; 191 h and 293 h, respectively. Condition (1) 630 mg xylose/L did not present a lag phase for xylose consumption in the anaerobic reactors. In contrast, conditions (2) 1341 mg xylose/L, (3) 1848 mg xylose/L and (4) 3588 mg xylose/L showed periods of lag phase in xylose consumption, respectively, at 14 h, 66 h and 148 h. Although there was microbial growth in the first hours of operation, the xylose consumption and H2 generation were reduced in the anaerobic reactors. In other words, the growth of the microbial consortium in the initial assays was attributed to the addition of peptone in the anaerobic reactors, and the maximum H2 generation was observed concomitantly with xylose consumption. Two pathways of xylose degradation can occur in the fermentative process of hydrogen gas production: (1) consumption of xylose generating acetic acid (equation (1)) and consumption of xylose generating butyric acid (equation (2)), as previously described. The volatile fatty acids generated were acetic, butyric, iso-butyric and iso-valeric in conditions (1) and (2) (Fig. 5 a). In higher xylose concentrations [conditions (3) and (4)], the production of propionic acid in reduced concentrations was also observed (Fig. 3b). The highest concentrations of acetic acid increased dramatically in conditions (3) and (4), and the maximum generations were observed at 856.8 mg/L and 1207.6 mg/L, respectively. Under the conditions studied, the generation of acetic acid was predominantly observed when compared with other volatile fatty acids. In this experiment both degradation pathways occurred, but the xylose conversion to acetic acid was favored in the first operational hours. However, when butyric acid was detected in the samples, the generation of H2 in the headspace of the anaerobic reactors was also observed. This evidence confirmed that H2 production was directly proportional to the mixture of intermediate products generated, mainly acetic and butyric acids [11]. The final pH for the experiment was 4.1, 4.0, 4.3 and 4.1, respectively for four conditions studied (Table 2). The decrease in pH was due to production of volatile fatty acids which depletes the buffering capacity of the medium resulting in low final pH [37]. Therefore, in this work, the predominant soluble metabolites were acetic acid, butyric acid and ethanol. Butyric acid was observed at 0.2%, 2.6%, 30.7% and 57.9% in the four studied conditions, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). Khanal et al. (2004) [37] observed the generation of acetic, butyric and propionic acids at pH 5.0 in reactors fed with sucrose (1500 mg/L), with production of 240 mg H2/g COD. Maintinguer et al., 2008 [5] observed generation of acetic acid in the maximum proportions of 98.8%, 97.7%, 69.3% and 42.1% in batch reactors with 630.0 mg sucrose/L, 1184.0 mg sucrose/L, 1816.0 mg sucrose/L and 4128.0 mg sucrose/L, respectively. Barros et al. (2011) [38] observed the generation of acetic and butyric acid and a low production of propionic acid in an anaerobic fluidized reactor (AFBR) treating synthetic wastewater containing glucose (4 g/L) at pH 5.5 with a yield of 2.15 mol H2/mol glucose. The generation of acetone and methanol remained constant throughout the operational period of the anaerobic reactors in the studied conditions (Table 3). In this case, the present microbial consortium did not consume this intermediary product in the anaerobic reactors. The ethanol production was gradual and increased in relation to the operational time. The maximum generation of ethanol was verified in the final sampling of all of the studied conditions (Table 3). There was no methane production in the anaerobic reactors, confirming the pre-treatment inoculum efficiency at an initial pH of 5.5. The combination of these two factors caused the inhibition of H2-consuming bacteria, archaea species and favored the growth of the bacteria that produce hydrogen such as Clostridium species [39]. In this study the xylose concentrations were not inhibitory to H2 generation in the reactors. The maximum H2 generation, maximum specific xylose consumption and H2 yields from xylose increased with increasing concentrations of xylose in the anaerobic reactors, as shown in Table 3. Condition (4) with 3588 mg/L xylose presented the best results [44.4% H2 (v/v) in headspace composition, 12,882.9 μmol H2/L, 270.0 μmol xylose consumed/L.h; 1928.5 μmol H2/g SSV.h and yields 0.8 mol H2/mol xylose]. It was noted that the maximum conversion of xylose of 0.8 mol H2/mol xylose, 0.6 mol H2/mol xylose, 0.5 mol H2/mol xylose and 0.2 mol H2/mol xylose occurred when the reactors were fed with 3588 mg xylose/L (condition 4), 1848 mg xylose/L (condition 3), 1341.0 mg xylose/L (condition 2) and 630 mg xylose/L (condition 1), respectively. Thermophilic microorganisms showed higher hydrogen production potentials in dark fermentation compared with mesophilic. The hydrogen bioproduction (270 μmol H2/L.h) observed in this work was fewer than in the study with Termosaccharolyticum W16 newly isolated moderately thermophilic bacterium, 10,700.0 μmol H2/L.h) [40]. However, the authors (op.cit.) operated batch reactors fed with higher concentrations of xylose (10 g/L) and the addition of yeast extract (2 g/L) and tryptone (2 g/L), at termophilic conditions (60 °C), which contributed to higher hydrogen production potential. Table 4 shows a comparison of the present study with previous studies regarding to the hydrogen yield and the configuration of the reactors as well as the pH, temperature, source of carbon and microorganisms involved in the studies. The H2 yield for condition (4) (0.8 mol H2/mol xylose) was slightly higher than that observed by Lin et al. (2008) [29] (0.7 mol H2/mol xylose) in chemostats at 35 °C with inoculum (sedimentation tank of municipal treatment plant) heat treated (100 °C, 45 min) and fed with 18.75 g xylose/L (i.e. 20 g COD/L). Analysis of the microbial diversity identified species of Clostridium sp., K. pneumoniae and Bacillus sp. Lo et al. (2008) [41] studied the H2 production in a batch reactor fed with 20 g xylose/L, at 37 °C, inoculated with C. butyricum CGS5 (strain isolated from effluents of sludge of a continuous dark fermentation bioreactor producing H2 from synthetic wastewater 20–40 g xylose COD/L), and the yield was 0.7 mol H2/mol xylose. Wu et al. (2008) [1] operated AGSB (power activated carbon-assisted agitated granular sludge bed) with 18.75 g xylose/L and observed the H2 yield of 0.8 mol H2/mol xylose and identified K. pneumoniae and C. butyricum. The authors concluded that K. pneumoniae played another role in oxygen consumption in the community to the benefit of the Clostridium species, thereby increasing the hydrogen production rate. Lin et al. (2006) [3] achieved 68% xylose removal at 120 h using inoculum from domestic sewage, at pH 7.0 and 35 °C in anaerobic batch reactors. Clostridium species were identified as responsible for H2 generation in the anaerobic reactors. The authors (op. cit.) observed higher H2 yields than the present work (1.17 mol H2/mol xylose); however, the reactors were operated at higher xylose concentrations (18.75 g/L). Zhao et al. (2010) [42] obtained hydrogen yield less than this work (0.33 mol H2/mol xylose) in anaerobic reactors fed with xylose (4.5 g/L) pH 6.5, 70 °C, peptone (0.5 g/L), FeSO4 (70 mg/L) with inoculum obtained from the reactor operated for H2 production, 70 °C, fed with xylose (2 g/L), peptone (1 g/L) and yeast extract (0.5 g/L). In the balance of hydrogen for the tests performed (1), (2) and (3) it was observed the same trend for xylose consumption and formation of metabolites (acids, alcohols and hydrogen gas) in similar proportions. However, for the condition (4) there was a change in the percentage of metabolites formed. Probably in this test, due to increased scale in the assembly of the anaerobic reactors (2 L reaction volume and 3 L of headspace) we observed a discontinuity in the calculation of the balance of hydrogen. In the other tests (1, 2 and 3) the proportion of reaction volume and headspace was the same (1 L), according Table 5 . The experimental results revealed that the major soluble metabolites produced from the Clostridium species during H2 fermentation were also butyric and acetic acid, while a smaller amount of valeric, iso-butyric and iso-valeric acid were also formed. Klebsiella species are common alcohol producers and frequently used for the production of commercially diols, such propanediol and butanediol [37]. Many factors contributed to the maintenance of Clostridium and Klebsiella species in the anaerobic reactors. The increase of the concentration of peptone to the nutritional medium [22], the heat treatment of the inoculum associated with the specific nutritional medium and the maintenance of the pH at 5.5 enriched these populations [5]. Therefore, the microorganisms from the inoculum showed metabolic functions that were similar to Clostridium and Klebsiella species. This fact revealed that the heat treated inoculum had a high capacity for degrading xylose and generating hydrogen gas. The biological production of hydrogen gas was due to the microorganism consortia that were present in the studied conditions."
10,Conclusions,"This study demonstrated that granulated sludge from a reactor treating slaughterhouse wastewaters was an effective natural mixed tropical microflora seed source for producing biohydrogen from xylose. The identified species were Clostridium sp., Clostridium aciditolerans, and K. pneumoniae, and they were able to utilize xylose for H2 production. Although H2 generation was observed, production of methane gas was not detected in the four operational conditions. This corroborated the heat treatment efficiency and the pH control in order to inhibit the bacteria consumers of H2 and methanogenic archaea. However, the heat treatment of inoculum did not eliminate the Bulkolderia species, which were probably associated with xylose degradation and subsequent acetic acid generation. The substrate concentrations used were not toxic to the biomass, which resulted in the generation of H2. For 3588 mg xylose/L the best yields of H2 (0.8 mol H2/mol xylose) were observed. The growth of the microbial consortium in the early assays was attributed to the addition of peptone in the anaerobic reactors, and the maximum H2 generations were observed concomitantly with xylose consumption. The H2 production was directly proportional to the mixture of the end products generated, which were mainly acetic and butyric acids. The concentrations of xylose used did not inhibit microbial growth and hydrogen production. This suggested the feasibility of the use of wastewater with low xylose concentrations as a source for hydrogen production."
