0,Introduction,"Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is a promising technique for reforming high moisture content biomass or waste feedstocks (70–95 wt.% water) to alternative and renewable fuels such as Hydrogen (H2) [1]. Dwindling fossil fuel reserves as well as the negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment from CO2 emissions has led to a tremendous interest in developing alternative energy sources. H2 is a promising alternative energy form with its use gaining in acceptance, and promoted as one of the cleanest energy vectors. Hydrogen's viability as a clean fuel is greatly enhanced if it is produced from renewable sources such as sewage sludge, manure, or other waste/biomass types. These waste streams are additionally becoming increasingly expensive to treat due to new nutrient management disposal laws. Of additional complication, often these feestocks have a high water content which requires expensive drying steps due to the inherent high heat capacity of water [2]. Supercritical water (SCW) has the advantage of using water directly as the reaction medium which eliminates the need for any expensive subsequent drying steps. SCW has low viscosity, and acts as a non-polar solvent with high diffusivity and excellent transport properties compared to other reforming techniques such as steam reforming [3–6]. SCW exhibits gas-like and liquid-like properties such as low density, high solubility, and high diffusivity which provides for the dissolution of many organic compounds. The dissolution of the organic compounds in SCW facilitates the high mass transfer fluxes that allow for faster reaction rates [7]. Biomass is composed mainly of cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin whereas waste biomass such as municipal sludge and manure are composed of protein, carbohydrates, lipids, and phenolic compounds [3]. H2 production from biomass and waste biomass using SCW has been the premise of many studies in recent years. Most of these studies were conducted using model compounds to enhance the fundamental understanding of SCW gasification, and to test the feasibility of H2 production from biomass. For example, Yu et al. [2] gasified glucose as a biomass model compound in SCW at 600 °C, 34.5 MPa, and 30 s residence time. The aforementioned authors reported that at glucose concentrations in the range of 0.1 M–0.6 M, there was no tar or char observed and the carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) exceeded 85%. Williams and Onwudili [8] studied the sub and supercritical non-catalytic gasification of glucose, cellulose, starch, and glucose as biomass model compounds at temperature and pressure ranges of 330–380 °C and 9.3–22.5 MPa respectively. They demonstrated that the production of H2 gas was greatest for glucose, followed by starch, then cellulose. Minowa et al. [9,10] conducted a series of experiments pertaining to cellulose gasification in SCW at 200–400 °C and 8–22 MPa, and demonstrated the possibility of H2 production from cellulose with CGE's up to 70% with the aid of a nickel catalyst. Gasification of catechol as a model compound for lignin in biomass and aromatic compounds in sludges for H2 production in SCW has also been investigated [3]. Kruse et al. [11] studied the effect of the process operating conditions i.e. pressure, temperature, concentration, and reaction time on catechol gasification using a continuous flow system, and compared their experimental results to equilibrium calculations. They reported that increasing temperature increased the H2 production yield, decreased CH4 formation with negligible carbon formation; with the pressure effect on the product distribution being negligible. They also investigated the influence of KOH addition as a homogeneous catalyst on the gasification efficiency, and reported that 99% gasification efficiency of catechol was achieved at 600 °C and 2-min reaction time or at 700 °C and 1 min reaction time. They also concluded that the presence of KOH facilitated achieving the calculated equilibrium gas composition, and the degradation of the aromatic compounds was complete at the experimental conditions employed. Wahyudiono et al. [3] studied the decomposition of catechol in SCW as an aromatic and lignin model compound for municipal sludge and biomass at temperatures of 370–420 °C and pressures of 25–40 MPa respectively. To identify the hydrolysis products, the aforementioned authors employed GC/MS and HPLC finding that phenol was the main compound identified along with other minor compounds including 2-cyclopentenone, 1, 2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, nonylphenol, 1, 4-dipropylbenzene, acetophenone, and other benzene and phenol substituted compounds. The authors concluded that the longer reaction time of 240 min facilitated the formation of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons with reaction pressure showing negligible effect on the product distribution. Although these various studies have enhanced the understanding of SCWG for H2 production, the effect of co-gasification of various biomass constituents such as carbohydrates, lipids, lignin, and cellulose on the complex product distribution types also needs to be considered. Co-gasification of model biomass components is required to provide an understanding of the interactions that cannot be deduced from single substrate studies alone. In this work, we report the experimental results of starch and catechol co-gasification in SCW, as starch is a model compound for carbohydrates, and catechol represents lignin and aromatic compounds. The rationale for this work is that biomass/waste biomass typically consists of 14% carbohydrate and 20% aromatic compounds [3]. This study also aims to provide an understanding of the reaction pathways occurring during co-gasification in SCW for future application to waste biomass gasification. Investigating the synergistic/inhibitory effects of co-gasification in the presence of CaO solely as well as in combination with TiO2 catalyst on the product gas composition is also another objective of this study."
1,Materials and methods,"Starch (C6H10O5) n , catechol (C6H6O2), calcium oxide powder (CaO) with a purity of 99%, and TiO2 catalyst were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). De-ionized water (18 m Ω resistivity) was obtained using a compact ultrapure water system (EASY pure LF, Mandel Scientific Co, model BDI-D7381). Starch and catechol solutions were individually prepared with concentrations of 9000, and 18,000 mg/L respectively. Each solution and mixture of starch and catechol were prepared by using purified water by mechanical mixing and heating. Table 1 reports all the performed experiments along with their testing conditions. As shown in Table 1, in experiments 1, 2, and 3, starch was gasified alone at 400, 450, and 500 °C, and catechol was gasified alone in experiments 4, 5, and 6 at the same temperature levels. Experiments 7, 8, and 9 were performed with different mixtures of starch and catechol. Experiments were performed in a 600 mL reactor from Autoclave Engineers, Erie, Penna, U.S.A. The reactor was constructed of Hastelloy C-276 with a capacity of 600 ml. The batch reactor allows for sampling of gas and liquid samples throughout the experiments. The reactor was heated with a 1.5 kW electrical furnace that surrounded its main body supplied by the same manufacturer. The reactor design operating temperature is 343 °C rated at 42 MPa which is below the critical points of water (373 °C, 22.1 MPa). However, it was able to reduce the maximum allowable pressure to 34 MPa at temperature of 500 °C. It should be pointed out that this modification in the reactor operating conditions was performed in accordance with the pressure temperature rating diagrams posted on the manufacturer's web page for Hastelloy C-276. The experimental procedure consists of several steps started by opening and washing the reactor body thoroughly with distilled water to remove any residue from previous experiments. The catalyst and 70 ml of de-ionized water were added to the reactor, after which it was closed and purged with helium gas at a constant pressure of 0.2 MPa for 20 min to drive away any air and oxygen present in the system. After purging with helium, the pressure in the reactor started increasing as the reactor was then heated to the desired temperature, with the pressure increased to about 22.8 MPa. After reaching the desired temperature, the reactor was left for 5 min to stabilize. Subsequently, the feed was injected into the reactor by employing a syringe pump (Model 100 DX, Lincoln NE, USA). Additional details about the experimental set up and procedures were described elsewhere [30]."
2,Data interpretation,"The calculations for the product gas yield, and carbon balance were performed as follows: (1) Gas yield = ( ml of gas species produced ) / ( g of carbon fed ) ) and, (2) Carbon balance = ( g carbon in the gas + g carbon in the liquid ) / g carbon in the feed The TOC reduction efficiency is defined as: (3) TOC reduction efficiency ( % ) = { [ TOC initial − TOC final ] / [ TOC initial ] } × 100 In order to obtain the amount of CO2 released and sequestered by the CaO for experiments 14–24 in Table 1, an aqueous solution of HCl was added to the solid residue in the reactor after each experiment to release CO2 according to the following equation: (4) CaCO 3 + 2 HCl → CaCl 2 + H 2 O + CO 2 The CO2 released was then collected in a gas bag after passing through the mass flow meter. The collected gas was then analyzed using the aforementioned Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC). The absorbed CO2 volume was calculated knowing the total gas volume i.e. helium and CO2. To ensure experimental reproducibility, two runs (Experiments no. 12 & 13 and 23 & 24) were selected randomly and repeated at the exact same conditions, with the overall error found to be less than 5%."
3,Results and discussion,
4,Non-catalytic gasification of starch & catechol,"4.1 Non-catalytic gasification of starch & catechol We first examine the effect of temperature (400, 450, and 500 °C) on the gasification of individual starch and catechol solutions at a residence time of 30 min as shown in Fig. 1 a and b. The gaseous products consisted mainly of H2, CO2, CH4, CO, and small quantities of C2–C3 hydrocarbons. As expected, the gaseous product yield increased significantly with increasing temperature for both individual compounds i.e. starch & catechol. For starch, as shown in Fig. 1a, the H2 content of the gas tripled from 10 to 30 ml/g carbon fed as the operating temperature increased from 400 to 500 °C. A similar increase in CO2 content of the gas from 26 ml/g carbon fed at 400 °C to 57 ml/g carbon fed at 500 °C was observed. Fig. 1b shows the gaseous product distribution from catechol gasification at 400, 450, and 500 °C. The increase in temperature resulted in increases in the gaseous product, similar to starch gasification. The H2 and CO2 yields produced from catechol were significantly lower than that produced from starch. A 50% lower H2 yield was produced with catechol corresponding to a yield of 16 ml/g carbon fed compared to 30 ml H2/g carbon fed produced from starch. Also, 21 ml of CO2/g carbon fed was produced at 500 °C with catechol compared to 57 ml CO2/g carbon fed produced from starch at the same temperature and reaction time. The increase in temperature is known to help shift the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O ⇋ CO2 + H2) to enhance H2 production at the expense of CO [12,13]."
5,Non-catalytic gasification of starch & catechol mixtures,"4.2 Non-catalytic gasification of starch & catechol mixtures We performed gasification of three blended starch and catechol mixtures at 500 °C and 30 min reaction. Fig. 2 shows the gaseous product yield for the three investigated starch to catechol ratios. As the starch composition in the feed increased from 60% to 80%, the H2 yield decreased by 27% from 37 to 29 ml/g carbon fed, and was increased by 36% from 29 to 45 ml/g carbon fed with starch composition in the feed of 40%. Similarly, the CO2 yield decreased by 28% from 56 to 35 ml/g carbon fed as starch composition in the feed increased from 60% to 80% and increased by 44% from 35 to 62 ml/g carbon fed as the starch composition increased from 60% to 80%. The CO yield remained the same at 6 ml/g carbon fed at starch composition in the feed of 40% and 60%. There was no apparent correlation between the H2 yield and the change in the composition. On this basis, we sought to link the H2 yield to the TOC reduction, as also shown in Fig. 2.The maximum TOC reduction of 61% was observed for 40% starch and 60% catechol, yet, the 80% starch and 20% catechol mixture blend provided the highest H2 yield of 44 ml/g carbon fed. Based on the maximum reduction in the TOC of the residual liquid and close to maximum H2 yield of 37 ml/g carbon fed, we selected the 40% starch and 60% catechol mixture for further catalytic investigations. In addition, this selection was based on the fact that biomass/waste biomass typically consists of 14% carbohydrate and 20% aromatic compounds which translate to 40% carbohydrate and 60% catechol [3]."
6,Catalytic gasification of starch & catechol mixtures,"4.3 Catalytic gasification of starch & catechol mixtures Fig. 3 shows the effect of addition of CaO and nano TiO2 both individually and combined on the gaseous product yield distribution with the gas yields summarized in Table 2 . The control experiment No. 9 was without catalyst. The enhancement of H2 yield of 2 ml/g carbon fed through the addition of CaO in experiment 10 was insignificant compared to the 35 ml/g carbon fed obtained in experiment 9. It is known that CaO sequesters CO2 to form CaCO3 through (CaO + CO2 → CaCO3). This reaction is exothermic and releases heat, thereby increasing ambient temperature and facilitating the cracking of the formed intermediate cyclo-compounds as discussed later in Table 3 . The CO2 yield in the same experiment decreased remarkably by 90% from 37 to 4 ml/g carbon fed which facilitated the increase of H2 content in the gas phase to 80%. Theoretically, the addition of CaO would facilitate Ca(OH)2 formation [5,14] which serves as a gasification catalyst that enhances the water-gas shift reaction and the production of H2. However, the low observed H2 yield in our experiment suggests that Ca(OH)2 formation was minimal and was overruled by the direct and fast reaction of CO2 with CaO to form CaCO3. Yang and Xi [15] concluded that the effect of steam on CaO carbonation forming CaCO3 was not significant and could not be attributed to Ca(OH)2 production. Comparing experiment no. 11 in which TiO2 was employed as catalyst with no added CaO to the control experiment no. 9 revealed another surprising observation. The use of TiO2 decreased H2 yield from 37 to 33 ml/g carbon fed as well as CO2 yield from 56 to 38 ml/g carbon fed. This decrease in both H2 and CO2 formation was associated with a decrease in the TOC reduction efficiency from 59% to 47%. This TOC reduction efficiency was also corroborated with the increase in the number of compounds detected in liquid phase (Table 3). Clearly, TiO2 was catalytically unable to gasify the aforementioned intermediate compounds. In experiment no. 12, where both TiO2 and CaO were employed as catalyst and CO2 sequestration agent respectively, an increase in the H2 yield coupled with a complete elimination of CO2, CO, and CH4 yields to almost zero was observed. The H2 yield increased by 33% from 37 to 55 ml/g carbon fed compared to the control experiment no. 9. The combination of CaO and TiO2 had a remarkable effect on gaseous product yield which was corroborated by the TOC reduction efficiency increasing from 47% to 65% as shown in Table 2. It is evident from Fig. 3 that the catalytic activity of TiO2 was inhibited as translated by an increase of 40% in the H2 yield during experiment no. 12 in which both CaO and TiO2 were employed relative to experiment no. 11 (TiO2 only). A possible inhibition route is the formation of cyclo-compounds through cyclo-addition reactions (e.g. Diels–Alder reactions and Huisgen cyclo-addition reaction) as it has been reported that the aforementioned compounds are very stable and are precursors of tarry materials and coke that eventually deactivate the TiO2 [16]. Another possible inhibition route is the formation of difficult-to-gasify intermediate cyclo-alkenes and cyclo-ketones such as cyclohexene and cyclopentanone [6,17] that has been observed in our experiments as discussed later in Section 4.6. This is also confirmed by the decrease in TOC reduction efficiency to 47% in experiment no. 11 relative to 65% in experiment 12. To rationalize the synergism between CaO and TiO2, we compared the CO2 yield from experiments no. 10 (CaO) only, no. 11 (TiO2) only, and no. 12 (CaO + TiO2). As evident from Fig. 3, the CO2 yields of 37.6, 3.7, and 0.4 mL/g carbon, respectively for TiO2, CaO, and CaO + TiO2, coupled with the H2 yields clearly emphasize that neither CaO nor TiO2 were at their peak catalytic activity when they were employed solely. Furthermore, upon comparing CO2 yields for CaO and TiO2 alone, it is evident that CaO did not sequester all available CO2 despite slightly enhancing the H2 yield. On the other hand, TiO2 cracking activity to gasify the intermediate formed cyclo-compounds was limited as translated by the lower hydrogen yield and higher amount of CO2 released. CaO plays a dual role in gasification; it serves as a catalyst and also sequesters CO2. Following CO2 sequestration, CaO changes to CaCO3, which is futile as catalyst. As evident from the work of Acharya et al. [32], who investigated various CaO/biomass ratios in the range of 0–2 for gasification of biomass at 670 °C and atmospheric pressure, the capacity of CaO is limited and hence its utilization for one role limits its availability for the other. In experiment no. 10, utilizing 1 g of CaO was insufficient for complete absorption of CO2. In the presence of TiO2, CaO sequestration of CO2, which is an exothermic reaction increased ambient temperature, thus mitigating the inhibition of TiO2 alluded to above and facilitating the gasification of the recalcitrant cyclo-compunds and others. Gasification of intermediates, though potentially produced CO and CO2, has definitely reduced the “catalytic” demand for CaO, allowing it to engage in the promotion of the water-gas shift reaction (as evidenced by the drastic decrease in CO yields relative to both CaO and TiO2 alone depicted in Fig. 3), and further absorption of CO2."
7,Effect of temperature and residence time on catalytic gasification of starch & catechol mixtures,"4.4 Effect of temperature and residence time on catalytic gasification of starch & catechol mixtures Table 2 shows the gas yield distribution at the three investigated reaction times of 10, 20, and 30 min at the four studied temperature levels of 400, 425, 450, and 500 °C. Increasing the reaction temperature increased the gaseous product yields to a greater extent than that due to the reaction time increase. For example, at 10 min reaction time, the H2 yield increased by 40% from 3 to 5.1 ml/g carbon fed at 425 °C, to 9.5 ml/g carbon fed at 450 °C, and to 41 ml/g carbon fed at 500 °C. The same increasing trend was observed for the CO2 and CH4 yields, although the increases were less compared to the sharp increase in the H2 yield at the same conditions. The CO2 yield increased by 6% from 34 to 37 ml/g carbon fed as the temperature increased from 450 to 500 °C and 10 min reaction time whereas the CO yield decreased by 45% from 3 to 1.6 ml/g carbon fed. By increasing the reaction time to 20 min, a similar trend of increasing gaseous product yields at the three investigated temperatures of 400, 425, and 450 °C was observed. The increase in the H2 yield followed a similar trend from 8 to 12 ml/g carbon as the temperature increased from 400 to 450 °C. Generally, CO2 and H2 were the predominant gases measured in all experiments and their corresponding concentrations were relatively close. Williams and Onwudili [18] who studied glycerol decomposition in sub and supercritical water reported that higher temperatures facilitated the decomposition of thermally resistant intermediates and led to more gaseous formation at the expense of residual liquid TOC. This observation is substantiated by the relative constant concentration of CO which decreased only as the temperature increased to 500 °C at the three reaction times tested. The decrease in CO concentration was accompanied with a corresponding increase in the other gaseous products including CO2 and H2. This implies that the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) contribution to both H2 and CO2 formation was more pronounced at 500 °C and 30 min reaction time as the CO concentration decreased from 9 ml/g carbon fed at 400 and 450 °C (experiments no. 15 & 16) and 30 min reaction time to zero at 500 °C. The presence of CaO as CO2 sequester facilitated the forward direction of the water-gas shift reaction as reported by Han and Harrison [7], who reported that the water-gas shift equilibrium reaction, which is exothermic, is facilitated through the removal of CO2 where the reaction proceeds in the forward direction. Thus, the temperature increase resulted in increasing gaseous products through thermal decomposition of intermediates and the presence of CaO facilitated the CO2 sequestration and eventually increased the H2 yield as a result of the water-gas shift reaction. Table 2 also shows the carbon balance based on both the released and measured CO2. The carbon balance closures were in close proximity and within acceptable ranges given that the unconverted carbon residue in the reactor was not measured because of the difficulty of separating it from the CaCO3."
8,Effect of residence time and temperature on liquid effluent quality,"4.5 Effect of residence time and temperature on liquid effluent quality Fig. 4 portrays the characteristics of the liquid effluent in terms of TOC reduction efficiency. The general observation is that increasing the reaction time increases the reduction efficiencies; however, the effect of reaction time was less influential than temperature. For example, the TOC reduction efficiency at 500 °C and reaction time of 10 min was 30% higher than its counterpart at the same reaction time and 400 °C. The increase in the TOC reduction efficiency with increasing residence time was found to be in good agreement with the results reported by Williams and Onwudili [8,19]. At reaction times of 10 and 20 min, the TOC reduction efficiency was in the range of 50% or less even at the maximum operating temperature of 500 °C. As the reaction time increased to 30 min, the TOC reduction efficiency was above 50% at the lowest operating temperature of 400 °C, and reached as high as 65% at 500 °C. This implies that the relatively low TOC reduction efficiencies obtained at low reaction times were due to the formation of intermediate products which were difficult to gasify. The impact of reaction time appears to diminish with increasing temperature. For example, a 28% increase in TOC reduction efficiency was achieved by tripling the reaction time from 10 to 30 min at 400 °C while only 23% increase in TOC reduction efficiency was achieved by tripling the reaction time from 10 to 30 min at 425 °C. Similar observations were obtained by tripling the reaction time at 450 and 500 °C where the TOC reduction efficiency increased by 21% and 19% respectively. It has been reported that the initial conversion of organic compounds during SCW gasification process occurs very fast initially and subsequently slows down afterwards [20,21]."
9,Characterization of the process liquid effluent and possible reaction pathways,"4.6 Characterization of the process liquid effluent and possible reaction pathways To obtain a better understanding of the compounds chemical transformation during the co-gasification of starch and catechol in SCW, we performed a qualitative analysis of the process liquid effluent for some selected experiments using gas chromatography/mass spectrophotometry (GC/MS) [31]. The selected liquid samples subjected to this analysis originated from experiments 7–12 (Table 1). Table 3 reports all the detected products according to the aforementioned criteria i.e. similarity indexes ≥ 80 with total of 33 compounds being reported. At both feed composition ratios of 80% starch:20% catechol and 40% starch: 60% catechol, the detected compounds were mainly cyclo-compounds, phenolic compounds and substituted phenols. Phenol was likely formed through C–OH bond cleavage as reported by Wahyudiono et al. [3] for catechol decomposition proceeding through the scission of an O–H bond that facilitates the formation of hydroxy-substituted phenoxy radical and H atom, and the H atom then reacts with catechol to form phenol and OH. Phenol can also be formed through the dehydration of furfural whereas the presence of alkyl-phenols such as isopropyl phenol, ethylphenol, and cresols confirms the reactions of functional groups e.g. hydroxyl and carbonyl groups with phenolic substitutes forming higher molecular weight compounds. This is supported by the results of Sato et al. [20] who confirmed the formation of alkyl-phenols resulting from the reaction of 2-propanol with phenol at temperature of 400 °C and pressure range of 4–36 MPa. On the other hand, the presence of furfural and 5-hydroxymethyfurfural (5-HMF) provides evidence that starch decomposition route was through formation of glucose and fructose as reported by Nagamori and Funazukur [22]. During experiments 7 & 9, several cyclo-compounds such as cyclopentanone, cyclohexene, and cyclobutane were detected. The absence of aromatic hydrocarbons and presence of cyclo-ketones, and substituted cyclo-ketones implies that aromatization reactions were limited and cyclo-addition reactions were facilitated through the Diels–Alder reaction and Huisgen cyclo-addition reaction. It is also possible that cyclo-compounds were produced through hydrogenation of benzene i.e. cyclohexene and cyclohexane production reactions. The presence of adipic acid confirms the aforementioned reaction route as cyclohexene is a precursor to adipic acid. The absence of aromatic hydrocarbons reveals that they were consumed through the formation of radicals which conjugated with phenol to form cresols [23]. At a feed composition of 60% starch and 40% catechol i.e. experiment no. 8, an interesting observation of the detected compounds distribution was noted. The number of cyclo-compounds decreased whereas the number of phenolic compounds detected remained the same as compared to experiments 7 & 9. This shift indicates that cyclo-compunds could be formed from starch intermediate products such as fructose. This is noteworthy as it is believed that aromatic and cyclo-compounds usually form from the lignin portion in lignocellulosic decomposition in SCW which is also supported by the absence of the 5-HMF as reported by Luijkx et al. [24]. The aforementioned authors found that 1, 2, 4-benzenetriol was formed at a high yield of up to 46% from 5-HMF. At a feed composition of 40% starch and 60% catechol, the major products were composed of phenol and alkyl-substituted phenols such as cresols. This could be attributed to the reported results by Elliot et al. [25], who reported that the carbonate ion reacts with water and forms a hydroxyl ion. The hydroxyl ion liberates phenol and substituted phenols through the cleavage of ether linkages of catechol. On the other hand, the disappearance of cyclo-ketone compounds such as cyclopentanone, and cyclo-hexanone suggests that the cyclo-addition reactions were limited. The presence of compounds such as ethylphenol, isopropyl phenol suggests that the C–OH bond cleavage occurred and produced hydroxyl functional group which reacted with phenol and formed the aforementioned compounds [26]. This is also mirrored by the absence of 5-HMF and conforms to the reported results by Kumar et al. [27] who suggested that under alkaline conditions, the formation of 5-HMF is unlikely whereas the formation of substituted phenols is expected. Experiment no. 11 in which nano TiO2 was employed as a catalyst resulted in the detection of compounds such as cyclobutane, cyclopentanone, cyclopentene-1-one, ethylphenol, isopropyl phenol, and indanol which were not observed in experiment 10 where only CaO was employed. Another interesting observation in experiment 11 is the decrease in the H2, and CO2 yields as well as the TOC reduction efficiency. This indicates that the TiO2 did not facilitate the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) and rather, it clearly facilitated the formation of cyclo-ketones, cyclo-alkane, phenols, cresols, and alkyl-phenols. On the other hand, the combination of both TiO2 and CaO inhibited the formation of the aforementioned compounds except phenol and cresols. The unique presence of phenol and cresols in all experiments confirms that they are largely stable under SCW conditions. The inhibition of cyclo-ketones and cyclo-alkane formation in experiment 11 was accompanied by a remarkable increase in the H2 yield by 33% from 37 to 55 ml/g carbon fed compared to the control experiment 9 which indicates the occurrence of the cracking and dehydrogenation reactions of the cyclo-compounds and their precursors [28]."
10,Possible reaction pathways,"4.7 Possible reaction pathways Based on the above discussion, we postulated the possible reaction pathways for co-gasification of starch and catechol in SCW with and without CaO, TiO2, and the combined CaO + TiO2 catalysts. Fig. 5 provides a schematic diagram of the possible reaction pathways based on the experimental results, GC/MS analysis, and the reported results pertaining to carbohydrates, lignin, and phenols decomposition in SCW [3,10,20,23–29]. The formation of gaseous products was mainly through the direct decomposition of starch, catechol, and intermediates as shown in Fig. 5 through routes 1, 2, and 3. Examples of the intermediates are glucose, acids, aldehydes and other unknown intermediates that were formed and degraded during each experiment. Phenol formation was from catechol through route 4 as reported by Wahyudiono et al. [3]. The presence of 5-HMF (routes 5, 6, and 7) indicates that starch degradation produced glucose and fructose which has been reported in the literature by Nagamori and Funazukuri [22]. Route 8 suggests the possible formation of phenol from the furfurals and 5-HMF through a dehydration reaction. The formation of cyclo-compounds such as cyclohexene and cyclohexane was possible through route 10 and 11 where the hydrogenation reaction of aromatic rings such as benzene was facilitated. The production of hydroxyl or carbonyl groups through the C–OH scission of catechol facilitated phenol reaction with alkyl group originated from acids, aldehydes, alcohols (route 12) which translates to the formation of alkyl-phenols. Ketones and substituted ketones were formed through the facilitation of cyclo-addition reactions such as Diels–Alder and Huisgen reactions."
11,Conclusions,"Co-gasification of starch as a model carbohydrate and catechol as a model of lignin was performed in SCW. Experiments were performed in presence of CaO, TiO2, and the combined CaO + TiO2 catalysts at four different temperatures ranges from 400 to 500 °C and three reaction times of 10, 20, and 30 min. Results showed that the amount of gas produced increased as the reaction temperature and time increased. The effect of temperature on gaseous products was more pronounced than the reaction time. The enhancement of H2 yield through the addition of CaO was insignificant, and the CO2 yield decreased remarkably by 90% which facilitated the increase of H2 content in the gas phase to 80%. The use of TiO2 as sole catalyst facilitated the formation of cyclo-compounds such as cyclohexene, cyclobutane, and cyclopentanone which inhibited gaseous production formation."
