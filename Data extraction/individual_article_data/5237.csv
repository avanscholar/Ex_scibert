0,Introduction,"One of the main goals of the European and in general of the global policy is the reduction of the fossil fuel usage with a contemporary exploitation of renewable energies. In this scenario, hydrogen can play an important role. It is a sustainable energy carrier and a green fuel. In the next years its progressive use could help to decrease the harmful emissions of the industrial and transportation sectors [1]. Currently, hydrogen is mainly produced by the steam reforming of hydrocarbons, which is a non-sustainable route, leading to an increase of the CO2 emission [2]. Several efforts were made in these years to obtain a green H2 production [3,4]. The strategy to combine a renewable energy source, as for instance the solar energy, with a consolidate technology, as the water electrolysis, or with new technologies, as the photocatalysis, are valuable examples of environmental friendly approaches to produce hydrogen [5]. In particular, the solar photocatalytic H2 production can be considered a fascinating and simple method to obtain hydrogen, requiring only solar energy, water and a semiconductor photocatalyst [6]. Since the first work of Fujishima and Honda in the early 1970 [7], the photocatalytic overall water splitting and the photoreforming reactions (i.e. with sacrificial agents in the reaction mixture) rapidly became interesting and attractive cases of sustainable hydrogen production [8,9]. The process involves the use of a semiconductor (the most used is the titanium dioxide, TiO2). When the photocatalyst is irradiated with an appropriate wavelength, (λ ≤ Eg = semiconductor band-gap) the promotion of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the semiconductor occurs, with the consequent formation of holes in the valence band [10]. The excited electrons can reduce, in this way, the protons from water [11]. To increase the production of hydrogen and limit the recombination of the charge carriers, i.e. the photoelectrons and the photoholes, an organic compound scavenger (for example an alcohol) is frequently added to the reaction mixture. Considering the involved processes, it is clear as the choice of the most suitable semiconductor is one of the crucial parameters that affect the hydrogen evolution. The width of the semiconductor band-gap and the levels of the conduction and valence bands are key features. The bottom level of the semiconductor conduction band has to be more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2 (-0.41 V vs. Normal Hydrogen Electrode, NHE, at pH = 7), while the top level of the valence band has to be more positive than the redox potential of O2/H2O (+ 0.81 V at pH = 7) [12]. The band-gap (3.0–3.2 eV, depending on the TiO2 phase) and the band levels of TiO2, allow the photocatalytic hydrogen production but, only the UV portion of the solar radiation (∼ 5 %) is exploited. Different strategies were proposed to improve the performance of TiO2 under solar irradiation, as the formation of composites [13–15], the metal or non-metal doping [16–18], the surface modifications and similar approaches [19–22]. Although these methodologies, or the combination of them, gave interesting results, the obtained H2 yields remain still away for a valuable domestic or industrial application. Recently, notwithstanding the hydrogen production was sometimes lower compared to the TiO2-based materials, new unconventional photocatalysts were investigated for this process, such as Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) [23], perovskites [24] or other metal oxides (ZnO [25,26], Bi2O3 [27,28] or BiVO4 [29,30]) with the target to be able, in the next future, to widely apply these new materials, with or without TiO2, in scale-up processes. In this context, cerium oxide (ceria, CeO2) can be considered an interesting alternative metal oxide photocatalyst. It is largely used in heterogeneous catalysis due to its peculiar properties as the coexistence of the Ce4+/Ce3+ species that allows to exploit its redox properties, the empty 4f level that facilitates the electrons transfer, the oxygen storage ability and the lower band-gap (2.7–2.9 eV) compared to TiO2 and ZnO [31,32], that permits a better use of the solar radiation. Due to its properties, cerium oxide can be used as co-catalyst of other semiconductors. The good affinity with TiO2 is largely reported in the literature [33–35], and the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple can be also used as sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic hydrogen production [36]. In contrast, there are few studies focused on the performance of CeO2 and CeO2-based materials, especially regarding the visible/solar water splitting or the photoreforming reactions [37–39]. In this work, we have examined the performance and the physico-chemical properties of CeO2-based materials, highlighting as the chemical or structural modifications of this oxide, or a combination of them, influenced the photocatalytic H2 production. In detail, we have analysed the properties and the performance of the CeO2-WO3 composites synthetized with different techniques. Tungsten trioxide (WO3) was usually employed to increase the charge carriers separation in the heterostructured photocatalysts, owning to strong photo-oxidation ability [40,41]. Up to now, its interaction with CeO2 was poorly investigated in the literature. We have also examined the influence of the laser irradiation in liquid on these materials. The laser modification of metal oxides is a fast and performing method to introduce defects and to modify the properties of samples. TiO2 laser-modified materials gave optimal results in the photocatalytic evolution of H2 especially under UV irradiation [42–45]. The effects of this treatment on CeO2 and CeO2-based materials were, at the best of our knowledge, not yet explored."
1,Experimental,
2,Samples preparation,"2.1 Samples preparation The bare CeO2 (coded as CeO2) was prepared by chemical precipitation from 4.3 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O keeping the pH above 8 by dropping a KOH solution (2 M). The obtained suspension was vigorously stirred at 80 °C for 3 h and kept digesting for 1 day. Then, the obtained slurry was filtered, washed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C for 24 h. Finally, the powders were calcined in air at 350 °C for 4 h. A commercial powder sample (Sigma-Aldrich CAS Number: 1306-38-3) was used for comparison (coded as CeO2 (C)). The as-prepared WO3 (coded as WO3) was obtained by precipitation of sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O), by a modified procedure with respect to that reported in the ref. [46]. Specifically, 660 mg of Na2WO4·2H2O were dissolved in water under stirring at 75 °C and then some drops of a solution of HCl (12 M) were added until reaching the pH = 1. The yellow precipitate was decanted for 24 h, then filtered and the obtained solid was washed several times with deionized water. After, the powders were dried at 80 °C and calcined in air at 450 °C for 3 h. The commercial tungsten (VI) oxide powder (coded as WO3 (C)) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (CAS Number: 1314-35-8). Different procedures were used to prepare the CeO2-WO3 composites. The as-coded CeO2-W5 and CeO2-W10 composites were synthetized by co-precipitation. Specifically, 2.5 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O in water were added in a three necks bottom flask and heated at 80 °C under stirring. Two dropping funnels were placed in the side necks; the first one filled with a KOH solution (2 M), the second one with the stoichiometric amount of WCl6 (to get a nominal concentration of 5 or 10 wt percentage, wt%, of tungsten trioxide for a total amount of 85.5 mg and 171 mg, respectively) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol. The central neck was used for the pH control with a pH meter. The KOH was dropped until the pH > 8 was reached and then the tungsten oxide precursor was admitted, to allow the simultaneous precipitation of the two oxides. The suspension was stirred for 3 h and kept digesting for 1 day. Then the slurry was filtered and dried in oven at 80 °C. Finally, the resulting powders were calcined at 350 °C for 4 h. These samples were coded as CeO2-WX, where X is the wt% of WO3. Other two sets of heterostructured CeO2-WO3 composites were prepared: in the first set the as-prepared WO3 powders were dispersed in a cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) solution (0.02 M) and then a solution of 2.5 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and KOH were added following the same procedure described for the bare CeO2 preparation. The powders were dried at 80 °C and calcined for 4 h at 350 °C. A second set of mixed oxides was prepared replacing the CTAB with the hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) solution (2·10−4 M). The obtained powders were filtered, washed with deionized water, dried in air at 80 °C and finally calcined at 350 °C for 4 h. These samples were synthetized utilizing different wt% of WO3 powders (5 and 10), and were coded as CeO2-WX(CTAB/HMTA), where X is the wt% of WO3, and the code CTAB or HMTA indicates the surfactant used. Finally, two samples, i.e. CeO2 and CeO2-W10 (HMTA) were modified with a laser treatment in liquid [45]. The powders were dispersed in water and laser-irradiated under continuous stirring. The Nd:YAG pulsed laser system (Quantasystem) with the third harmonic radiation (355 nm) was employed (pulse duration of 5 ns, repetition rate of 10 Hz). The laser beam size was around 28 mm2, and it was directed toward the ceria and ceria-based dispersion without any focusing lens. The suspensions were irradiated homogeneously at constant laser power of 190 mW (fluence 300 mJ/cm2) for 60 min. During the irradiation, no plasma emission was detected. Immediately after the laser irradiation, the initially yellow suspensions turned towards pale yellow/grey colour. These samples were coded as CeO2-LT and CeO2-W10 (HMTA)-LT."
3,Samples characterization,"2.2 Samples characterization The Raman characterization was performed exciting the samples with an Ar ion laser (514.5 nm) using a Jobin Yvon 450 mm focal length monochromator, equipped with a CCD camera detector, cooled at 77 K. The UV–vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) measurements were carried out with a Cary 60 spectrometer. The band-gap energies (Eg) of the samples were estimated plotting the modified Kubelka–Munk function, [F(R∞) h]1/2, vs. the energy of the exciting light. R∞ is the reflectance of an infinitely thick layer, h and ν are the Planck’s constant and the light frequency, respectively. The intercept of the tangent to the x-axis gives, with an appreciable approximation, the optical band-gap energy of the photocatalysts [13]. It is important to highlight that the application of this method to mixed semiconductor oxides can lead to an inaccurate estimation of the Eg. As reported in the literature, in fact, the reflectance spectra of these materials are more complex compared to a bare semiconductor oxide with a homogenous crystalline phase [47–49]. Therefore, it is not easy to discriminate the transition modes and to extrapolate the Eg values. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out with a Horiba JobinYvon spectrofluorometer. The spectra were obtained with a λ of excitation of 300 nm. The BET surface area of the photocatalysts were obtained by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements with a ThermoQuest Sorptomatic series 1990 instrument, outgassing the samples overnight at 120 °C. The morphology of the samples was evaluated with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM), using a Jeol JEM 2100 F operating at 200 kV. The average particle diameter size (dTEM) was estimated using the following formula: dTEM = Σ(nidi)/ni, where ni is the number of particles of diameter di. To have a good statistical particle size distribution several different areas of the TEM grid were analysed and more than 150 particles measured for each sample. The XPS measurements were carried out with a K-Alpha™+ X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The C (1 s) peak at 284.9 eV (ascribed to the adventitious carbon) was used as reference. The fittings of the Ce 3d and W 4f XPS spectra were performed using Gaussian envelopes after subtraction of the background. This process comprises data refinement, based on the procedure of the least squares fitting, carried out till there was the highest possible correlation between the experimental spectrum (obs.) and the theoretical (calc.) profile. The residual or agreement factor R, defined by R = [∑(Fobs- Fcalc)2/∑(Fobs)2]1/2 after minimization of the function ∑(Fobs- Fcalc)2, converged to the value of 0.03. The fitting was performed using the XPSPEAK4.1 software."
4,Photocatalytic activity experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity experiments The solar hydrogen production by photocatalytic reforming of aqueous ethanol solution was performed in a home-made Pyrex jacketed reactor thermostated at 30 °C (Fig. S1). The quantification of the evolved H2 was estimated analysing the effluent gases with an online gas chromatograph equipped with a packed column (Carboxen 1000) and a TCD (thermal conductivity detector) using Argon as carrier gas. The reaction mixture (50 mg of catalyst, 45 ml of deionized water and 5 mL of ethanol) was kept under stirring inside the photo-reactor. Before the solar irradiation, the suspension was purged with an argon flow for 1 h to remove the dissolved air. Then the reactor was irradiated for 5 h using a special lamp specifically designed for the sunlight simulation (Osram Ultra Vitalux 300 W, irradiance of 10.7 mW/cm2, emission spectrum Fig. S2). In accordance with the literature data [13,50] the H2 formation can arise both from water splitting and ethanol reforming, whereas the presence of carbon dioxide detected during the photocatalytic measurements was reasonably due to the oxidation of the alcohol."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Comparison between the bare oxides,"3.1 Comparison between the bare oxides Fig. 1 reports the H2 evolution under simulated solar irradiation of the bare CeO2 and WO3 oxides. The as-prepared CeO2 sample showed a twice higher H2 yield compared to commercial CeO2 (CeO2 (C)). This higher activity can be due to the higher surface area (81 m2/g) and to the lower optical band-gap (2.82 eV) of the as-prepared ceria compared to the commercial one (surface area of 35 m2/g and band-gap of 2.92 eV, Table 1 and Fig. 2 ). As expected, both cerium oxide samples were much more active than the as-prepared and the commercial WO3. Indeed, although the tungsten oxide samples showed a lower band-gap (2.59 eV for WO3 and 2.61 eV for WO3 (C), see Table 1) the conduction band position of WO3 does not allow the H2 evolution, being at about −0.3 V at pH = 7, more positive than the H+/H2 potential (−0.41 V). On the contrary, the valence band position at about + 3 V is higher than the O2/H2O potential (+ 0.81 V at pH = 7) and it is optimal for oxidation reactions [51,52]. As a result, the activity of commercial WO3 was negligible, whereas the as-synthetized WO3 showed a slight H2 production, probably due to the presence of structural defects in the prepared sample and to its higher surface area (15 m2/g) than the commercial WO3 (5 m2/g) (Table 1). Fig. 2 displays the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the bare oxides. Fig. 2A plots the Kubelka-Munk function, i.e. the reflectance function versus the wavelength. Fig. 2B illustrates the estimation of the optical band-gap of the oxides through the modified Kubelka-Munk function. It is possible to note that the WO3 samples exhibited an absorption band shifted towards higher wavelengths and consequently lower band-gap compared to the CeO2 samples [31,51,52]. On the basis of the above results the CeO2-WO3 composites were prepared using the as-synthetized WO3, since this sample was more active compared to the commercial WO3. We have selected the calcination temperature of 350 °C for the preparation of the composites because it allowed to have a good photoactivity of CeO2, i.e., the main oxide of the as-prepared composites, whereas a higher calcination temperature (as 450 °C used for the synthesis of bare WO3) had a detrimental effect on the activity of CeO2 (Fig. S3). On the contrary, the as-prepared WO3 calcined at 350 °C did not show significant variations both in the photoactivity and in the BET surface area (Fig. S3, Table S1), with respect to that calcined at 450 °C."
7,Comparison among the CeO2-WO3 composites,"3.2 Comparison among the CeO2-WO3 composites Fig. 3 depicts the comparison among the various investigated CeO2-WO3 composites. On the basis of the photoproduced amount of hydrogen, the order of activity was: CeO2-W10(HMTA) > CeO2-W5 > CeO2 > CeO2-W5(HMTA) > CeO2-W10 > CeO2-W5(CTAB) ≥ CeO2-W10(CTAB). The samples prepared with the HMTA were more active compared to the corresponding ones prepared with the CTAB. Noteworthy, only the CeO2-W10(HMTA) and the CeO2-W5 composites were more active compared to CeO2, pointing to as the chemical modifications are effective only in specific conditions. For the composites prepared with the co-precipitation method, the optimal amount of WO3 was 5 wt%, a higher amount of tungsten oxide being detrimental. For the HMTA-based samples the influence of the addition of WO3 followed an opposite trend, being CeO2-W10(HMTA) more active than CeO2-W5(HMTA). The effects of different amounts of WO3 on these systems are reported in the Fig. S4 and Table S2. Interesting the Table 2 , where the BET Surface area and the band-gap energies for the CeO2-WO3 composites are summarized, shows that a growing amount of WO3 led to a decrease of surface area for the samples prepared by co-precipitation, 89 m2/g for the CeO2-W5 sample versus 74 m2/g for the CeO2-W10 composite. This latter catalyst had also a lower surface area compared to the as-prepared CeO2 (81 m2/g) and this can be a reason of the lower photoactivity. Indeed, similarly to other composites reported in the literature [33,53], an excess of the hosted oxide (in this case WO3) can cover the surface active sites of the main oxide (in this case CeO2) hindering the light absorption process. Furthermore, considering the photocatalytic results of the bare oxides reported in the Fig. 1, an excessive amount of WO3 is detrimental for the photocatalytic H2 production, being this oxide not so active for this reaction. On the contrary, for the composites prepared with the addition of surfactants, the surface area remained the same of bare CeO2 for the CTAB-based samples, independently to the nominal concentration of WO3, whereas the use of HMTA allowed to increase the surface area from 83 m2/g of CeO2-W5(HMTA) to 94 m2/g of CeO2-W10(HMTA). Probably the HMTA favoured a better dispersion of WO3 on CeO2 even with a higher amount of tungsten oxide, thus explaining the highest H2 production of the CeO2-W10(HMTA) sample among all the investigated composites. Interestingly, this sample showed also the highest surface area (94 m2/g) and the lowest band-gap (2.59 eV). The CeO2-W5(HMTA) catalyst exhibited an Eg value of 2.63 eV (Table 2) whereas the Eg values of the composites prepared through co-precipitation were slightly higher (2.85, 2.86 eV) compared to the bare CeO2 (2.82 eV). The highest values of band-gap were obtained with the mixed oxides synthetized with the CTAB surfactant (2.95–2.97 eV). This can rationalize why the addition of CTAB did not result in performing CeO2-WO3 composites, despite the value of surface area (79 m2/g and 80 m2/g, Table 2) similar to that of bare ceria (81 m2/g)."
8,Laser treated samples and comparison among the best photocatalysts,"3.3 Laser treated samples and comparison among the best photocatalysts The best CeO2-WO3 composite, i.e. the CeO2-W10(HMTA), was chosen to investigate the effects of the pulsed laser irradiation in water comparing the results with those of bare CeO2. Fig. 4 shows the H2 evolution of the CeO2-laser treated samples. It is possible to note, that the laser modification of the bare ceria led to a slight enhancement of the H2 production (from 0.10 mmol/gcat∙h of CeO2 to 0.14 mmol/gcat∙h of CeO2-LT). Interestingly, a more relevant positive effect of the laser treatment was verified with the HMTA-based composite. Indeed, the CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT sample showed ∼ 2.4 times higher H2 photoproduction (0.41 mmol/gcat∙h) than the untreated CeO2-W10(HMTA) sample (0.17 mmol/gcat∙h) exhibiting the best H2 production compared to all the investigated catalysts. These data pointed to as the structural changes induced by the laser treatment were more efficient on the already chemically modified CeO2. Raman spectroscopy is particularly indicated to investigate the crystallographic structure of metal oxides including the presence of defects or lattice distortions [54]. Fig. 5 shows a comparison among the examined powders. The signal at 461 cm−1, typical of the cerium oxide-based materials, is attributed to the F2g vibration mode of the fluorite-like structure. The peak at 1060 cm−1 observed in the bare CeO2, in the CeO2-LT (with low intensity) and as a shoulder both in the CeO2-W10(HMTA) and CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT samples can be attributed to the second-order longitudinal optical mode [55,56]. Moreover, the small shoulder at about 600 cm−1, visible in the un-modified ceria, indicates the presence of oxygen vacancies due to non-stoichiometric Ce3+species [57,58]. In the CeO2-W10(HMTA) sample the two asymmetric peaks at about 720 and 810 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching of O–W–O modes of the bridging oxygens [59,60]. These signals are absent in the same catalyst treated with laser and in the CeO2-W5 composite. This can be due to a progressive incorporation of the hosted oxide into CeO2 during the laser treatment as reported in the literature [45,61]. In the composite prepared by co-precipitation, considering the low amount of WO3 compared to CeO2, the absence of these signals can be explained with the spreading of WO3 over the CeO2 surface, as already observed in other mixed oxides [53,62], or with the lower concentration of WO3 compared to the HMTA-based samples. Although the bare ceria and all the composites (including the CeO2-LT sample) did not show a specific morphology but were characterized by heterogeneously shaped particles, typical of the adopted preparation methods [63,64], the HRTEM analysis (Fig. 6 ) highlighted some differences between the samples prepared with the HMTA and the mixed oxide prepared by co-precipitation. In particular, in the CeO2-W5 composite (Fig. 6A) it is possible to observe the interface between the CeO2 (1 1 1) and the (2 0 0) planes of monoclinic WO3 according with the d-spacing values [46,65]. The two oxides exhibited a different average diameters, ∼ 13 nm for CeO2 and 7 nm for the tungsten trioxide (particle size distribution reported in the Fig. S5A). The boundary interaction between the two oxides changed in the sample synthetized with the HMTA (Fig. 6B). Indeed, the WO3 particles exhibited a lower mean size (about 4 nm) and were located around the cerium oxide, that maintained the same mean size (12 nm, Fig. S5B). Interestingly, the laser treatment of this latter sample (Fig. 6C) led to a further decrease of the WO3 size (∼ 2 nm, Fig. S5C) that favoured a higher dispersion and the incorporation of the hosted oxide into CeO2, as also confirmed by Raman measurements. The nanoparticles fragmentation due to the laser in liquid treatment is a phenomenon that has been reported to occur when this method was applied to nanoparticles with a size lower than 13 nm [45,66,67] using the experimental parameters of the laser in liquid process as those of this work. Indeed, the application of laser pulses with duration ranging from fs to ns and wavelengths from visible to ultraviolet at laser fluences high enough to match the photo‐fragmentation threshold of the nanoparticles (as 300 mJ cm−2 used here) leads to an equilibrium between the thermally excited hot electrons and the cold lattice of the nanoparticles. The continuous laser pulses increase the energy of the lattice with a part of this energy released into the medium due to heat transfer processes. This photothermal mechanism leads to continuous steps of heating-melting-evaporation (HME) of the nanoparticles that favour their fragmentation and size reduction [45,66,67]. This process mainly affected the WO3 nanoparticles which were smaller than CeO2 ones, which instead did not show substantial variation in the size compared to the laser untreated CeO2-W10(HMTA) sample, due to the larger mean size (12 nm, Fig. S5C). The modifications of the optical properties of bare CeO2 were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Fig. 7 ) and by UV–vis DRS measurements (Fig. 8 ). The PL spectra of bare ceria (Fig. 7) showed a strong band at about 460 nm related to its band-band emission whereas the signal at about 555 nm was attributed to the defects present as oxygen vacancies in the crystalline structure of ceria with electronic energy levels below the 4f band [68,69]. As reported, the PL band intensity is strictly connected to two main factors: i) the recombination of the photo-excited electron-hole pairs, the lower is the PL emission intensity the lower is their recombination rate; ii) the presence of defects and oxygen vacancies, with an enhancement of the emission intensity verified when the number of these features increases [53,70]. The resulting spectra can be rationalized considering a balance between these two effects. The CeO2-W5 composite showed a similar spectrum as the bare CeO2 with a decrease of the PL bands intensity that can be associated to a better charge carriers separation compared to CeO2. The CeO2-LT powders exhibited a broad envelope of bands in the region 430−450 nm, due to the defect states originated by the laser treatment and located between the Ce 4f state and the O 2p valence band [69]. As reported, these defects can act also as radiative recombination centres for the photoelectrons initially excited from the valence band to the 4f band of the CeO2 [71] and thus can explain the higher PL intensity compared to the bare CeO2. Presumably, in the CeO2-LT sample the recombination rate of the charge carriers is higher than in the un-modified CeO2. The two main bands of ceria (at 460 and 555 nm) were more intense in the CeO2-W10(HMTA) sample. This can indicate a major number of defects and oxygen vacancies in this material, reasonably due to the tungsten oxide acting as doping agent, and to a high recombination rate among the charge carriers. On the contrary after the laser treatment (CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT, magenta line) the PL bands were quenched. Considering that in this latter sample the presence of defects, typical of the laser-treated materials [42,44], was confirmed by the XPS measurements (see next paragraphs), it is reasonable that in this sample the balance between the two PL contributes is predominant towards a lower recombination rate between the photoelectrons and the photoholes compared to the other CeO2-based samples. A greater concentration of defects in the HMTA-based samples and the presence of WO3 in higher amount compared to the CeO2-W5 composite also produced a red shift in the UV–vis DRS spectra compared to the bare CeO2 (Fig. 8A). This is an indication of the decrease of the Eg values from 2.82 eV of CeO2 to 2.59 eV and 2.61 eV of CeO2-W10(HMTA) and CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT, respectively (Fig. 8B). On the contrary, the curve of the CeO2-LT catalyst was blue shifted compared to the bare CeO2, with an estimated optical band-gap of 2.93 eV. In the Fig. 8 the UV–vis DRS spectra of the as-prepared WO3 calcined at 350 °C (i.e. the same calcination temperature of all the CeO2-WO3 composites) is also reported. Noteworthy, compared to the bare WO3 calcined at 450 °C (Fig. 2), no significant changes both in the Eg values (2.60 eV) and in the BET surface area (Table S1) were observed. The BET surface area values were also similar after the laser process being 80 m2/g for the CeO2-LT (bare CeO2 = 81 m2/g) and 96 m2/g for the CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT composite (CeO2-W10(HMTA) = 94 m2/g). The surface properties of the best composites were analysed by XPS (Table 3 , Figs. 9 and S6). Considering the Ce 3d region (Fig. 9A) the bare ceria showed six typical signals: the bands at 882.1, 888.3 and 898.2 eV related to the Ce 3d5/2 states, and the bands at 900.5, 906.9 and 916.3 eV assigned to the Ce 3d3/2 states. The last peak, at 916.3 eV, was the characteristic fingerprint of the Ce4+ states [72–74]. The presence of Ce3+ was associated to the presence of peaks in the range 885.5–886.2 eV and 904.4–905.5 eV, this latter signal being usually overlapped by the other ones at 901 and 907 eV [72–74]. As stated by the other characterization measurements and as reported in the literature, even in the bare CeO2 the presence of non-stoichiometric Ce3+ species is common [34,75]. The surface Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio (Table 3) remained in the range 0.14−0.16 for the CeO2, CeO2-W5 and CeO2-W10(HMTA) powders, whereas there was a slight increase in the CeO2-LT sample (0.18) and a marked enhancement in the CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT catalyst (0.45). This points that in this material the chemical modifications induced by the tungsten trioxide (well dispersed on CeO2 due to the effect of HMTA) and the laser treatment led to a more defective ceria. These features were more evident in the XPS spectra of CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT (Fig. 9A). The major presence of Ce3+ and the high defectivity in this sample were confirmed by the peak at 885.2 eV [32,74], not visible in the other samples, and by the shift at higher binding energies (about 0.8−0.9 eV) of all the XPS bands compared to the bare cerium oxide. The formation of a more defective oxide was proved also with other laser-modified oxides, as for example TiO2 [42,44]. In fact, also in the CeO2-LT sample, where the laser modification played a minor impact on the photocatalytic performance, a shift at higher binding energy of all the ceria bands (of about 0.8 eV) was verified (Table 3). The W 4f region for CeO2-W5, CeO2-W10(HMTA) and CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT are depicted in the Fig. 9B. The shape of the peak indicates the presence of two spin-orbit doublets. This has been interpreted in terms of mixed oxide surface phases with metal atoms present in two or more distinct oxidation states [76,77]. From the Table 3 it is possible to note as the surface concentration of tungsten decreased in the CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT (5.2 at %) compared to the CeO2-W10(HMTA) (8.0 at %), confirming the progressive inclusion of WO3 into CeO2 after the laser treatment, as also verified by Raman and TEM measurements. A careful fitting of the experimental profile of the W 4f signal for the XPS spectrum of the CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT required two Gaussian spin-orbit components at 34.3 and 35.8 eV, respectively (inset of Fig. 9B). The spin-orbit separation is 2.2 eV. Furthermore, there is the presence of a Gaussian component due to the Ce 5 s levels at 37.0 eV [77]. The most intense spin-orbit components at 35.8 (W 4f7/2) and 38.0 eV (W 4f5/2) agree with the expected values for W(VI) in WO3 [78,79], whereas the low-intensity spin-orbit components (34.3–36.5 eV) were consistent with the presence of W4+ species [76]. These signals indicate that, after the laser treatment the tungsten oxide species, present in traces, can also act as doping agents of cerium oxide making it more defective. The XPS spectra of the CeO2-W5 and CeO2-W10(HMTA) show the presence of the same peaks at 0.2−0.3 higher binding energy. The two signals at 529.4 and 531.6 eV of the bare ceria, in the O 1s region, were attributed, to the lattice oxygens in metal oxides and to the hydroxyl species [73]. These signals are shifted at higher binding energies (about 0.9 eV) in the CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT composite (Table 3) confirming the high defective structure of this sample and the high electronic interaction between the cerium and the tungsten ions present with different oxidation states. Indeed, the shift at higher binding energies in both Ce and O regions of CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT powder compared to un-modified CeO2 can be explained both for the major presence of defects and for the higher electronegativity of tungsten (2.3) compared to cerium (1.1) [34,80] and therefore to the establishment of a strong interaction between the Ce and W ions. Noteworthy, in all the composites, no nitrogen (which could derive from the thermal decomposition of the HMTA or from the nitrates) or potassium ions were detected, thus ruling out any other doping effects related to other impurities."
9,Discussion and photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Discussion and photocatalytic mechanism From the above considerations, it is evident that the methodologies used to prepare the CeO2-based composites led to different photocatalytic performance suggesting that the effects of the chemical and/or structural modifications of CeO2 contributed in distinct ways. Focusing on the photocatalytic H2 production with a simulated solar light irradiation, the comparison between the investigated materials gave this order of activity (Figs. 1, 3 and 4): CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT > CeO2-W10(HMTA) > CeO2-LT > CeO2-W5 > CeO2, the other investigated composites exhibiting a lower activity compared to the bare CeO2. The possible photocatalytic mechanisms related to the four photocatalysts that exceeded the H2 production of CeO2 are illustrated in the Fig. 10 . On the basis of the characterization data in the CeO2-W5 composite a classical heterojunction between WO3 and CeO2 was formed (Fig. 10A), as already reported for similar CeO2-WO3 samples [81]. In particular, on the basis of the literature data [52,75], the band position of the two oxides after the photoexcitation due to the simulated solar irradiation, led to an electron transfer from the conduction band (CB) of CeO2 to that of WO3. Successively, these electrons were transferred to the empty 4f level of ceria that owned a high redox potential compared to the CB of WO3 [81,82] and the photoholes moved from the valence band (VB) of tungsten trioxide to the VB of ceria, oxidating in this way the water and the ethanol employed as sacrificial agent. Although with this configuration a good charge carriers separation was reached, the majority of photoelectrons, being in the CB of WO3, were not able to reduce the proton from water in so as the energy level of this band is more positive than the H+/H2 potential (Fig. 10A) [51,52]. As a result, only the residual photoelectrons in the CB of ceria gave H2. Consequently, with this sample merely a slight higher H2 production was observed, about 1.2 times than the bare ceria. This little H2 enhancement can be also associated both to the reduction of the charge carriers recombination rate as stated by PL measurements (Fig. 7) and to the slightly higher surface area (89 m2/g) compared to as-prepared CeO2 (81 m2/g). Indeed, the photocatalytic H2 production is a surface reaction and then, as reported in the literature, a high surface area of the photocatalysts is beneficial for the catalytic activity [6,83,84]. The laser treatment of CeO2 led to increase the H2 production of about 1.4 times compared to the bare CeO2 (Fig. 10B). In this case, as confirmed by the PL and XPS measurements, the introduction of defects occurred with the formation of mid-gap states. However, these mid-gap levels can act both as negative feature because they can be recombination points between the photoelectrons and the photoholes, and as beneficial feature playing also the role of traps of the excited electrons/holes, thus favouring the separation between the charge carriers. The balance between these opposite phenomena determined the measured photoactivity [85,86] resulting, in our case, in a moderate increase of the solar H2 photoproduction. The contemporaneous use of HMTA and WO3 allowed: i) a better dispersion of WO3 on CeO2, ii) a higher surface area (94 m2/g) and iii) a lower band-gap (2.59 eV) than the bare CeO2 (Table 2). The WO3 in this composite can be considered as a co-catalyst of CeO2 facilitating the absorption of solar light and the capture of the photoholes due its nature of strong oxidant photocatalyst (Fig. 10C). On the other way, the lack of an efficient heterojunction can increase the charge carriers recombination (see PL measurements). In this case, the balance between these features resulted in an increase of activity of about 1.7 times compared to CeO2. The CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT exhibited the same positive effects of the CeO2-W10(HMTA), further improved by the laser treatment. As confirmed by XPS measurements, this process allowed to considerably increase the presence of Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies, which are beneficial for the photoproduction of hydrogen [36,87]. In fact, the recombination rate between the photoelectrons and the photoholes was strongly slowed down (in the PL spectra the bands of ceria were quenched, Fig. 7). Although some photoelectrons can be scavenged for the formation of Ce3+, the progressive inclusion of WO3 inside the CeO2 activated a beneficial doping effect with consequent formation of mid-gap levels both deriving from the doping and the laser effects. These levels can further increase the charge carriers separation, maximizing the number of photoelectrons able to reduce the protons of water (Fig. 10D). However, some of these mid-gap levels could own an energy not sufficient to favour the protons reduction. In this case, the balance between the positive effects due to the increase of the charge carriers separation and the negative ones due to the formation of unfavourable (for the H2 production) mid-gap levels was preponderant towards the positive effects, sensibly enhancing (up to 4 times) the H2 evolution compared to the un-modified CeO2. The laser treatment of previous chemically modified CeO2 allowed to induce key structural changes in the CeO2-WO3 composite. This peculiar treatment led to short time continuous heating–melting–evaporation (HME) processes of WO3 nanoparticles that favoured their size decreasing and inclusion into CeO2 [45,66,67,88] and at the same time caused the formation of oxygen vacancies in the CeO2 structure. In this way, the presence of nanosized WO3 and CeO2 defects (as Ce3+) resulted in a material where the charge carriers are efficiently separated, with the photoelectrons able to reduce the protons of water, whereas the holes interacting with the WO3 nanoparticles boost the oxidation of water and ethanol, finally resulting in an effective H2 production. The photocatalytic performance of cerium oxide are at present, still away with respect to other consolidated materials, as for example TiO2 [43,89]. Until now, not many ceria-based materials were investigated in the solar/visible photocatalytic H2 evolution. Table 4 summarises the results of our best sample (CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT) together with other CeO2-based catalysts reported in the literature [90–93]. It must be underlined that a real quantitative comparison among the various photocatalysts is very difficult, due to the different experimental set-ups, irradiation sources and times of different works. The data of Table 4 confirm that the presence of doping agents in the CeO2 structure is the most performing approach to significantly enhance the H2 production. Indeed, the CeO2 catalyst co-doped with N, S and C, examined in the work of Hao et al. [93], showed the highest H2 production values among all materials reported in Table 4. Furthermore, by comparing the Apparent Quantum Efficiency percentages (AQE%) at λ = 420 nm and 550 nm following the same procedures reported in the reference [90], i.e. AQE% = [(2∙number of evolved hydrogen molecules)/(number of incident photons)]∙100, the calculated values of our best sample, i.e. the CeO2-W10(HMTA)-LT catalyst (AQE420 = 0.21 % and AQE550 = 0.043 %) are slightly higher than those obtained by Tian et al. [90] (AQE420 = 0.16 % and AQE550 = 0.040 %) with the CdS/Pt/WO3-CeOx composite. It is also worth to note that the laser treatment after the chemical modification of cerium oxide allowed to achieve a similar H2 production (0.41 mmol/gcat h of an anatase TiO2 laser-treated sample (0.39 mmol/gcat h under the same experimental conditions [44]."
10,Conclusions,"In this work different CeO2-based materials, employed as unconventional photocatalysts for the solar H2 production, were investigated. Among the various synthesis strategies, the utilization of the HMTA to better disperse the WO3 hosted oxide, followed by the laser treatment led to the powder catalyst with the best performance. Indeed, this peculiar preparation allowed to sensibly boost up the charge carriers separation, and favoured the doping process of WO3 with formation of a more defective ceria. As a result, the H2 production was enhanced up to 4 times compared to the bare cerium oxide. The chemical modifications of ceria combined to the structural modifications are fascinating to obtain solar-driven photocatalysts for a sustainable evolution of hydrogen."
