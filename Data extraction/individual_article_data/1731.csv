0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is considered a promising sustainable source for producing bio-derived fuels, value-added chemicals, raw materials, and fuel gas without a negative impact on the environment [1,2]. Lignocellulosic biomass mainly consists of three organic components, namely hemicellulose, lignin, and cellulose [3,4]. The proportion of each component varies with the type and origin of the biomass. Lignin is made up of phenyl propane alcohols interlinked with β-O-4 and β-5 bonding [5], and is considered an aromatic polymer in nature. consisted of functional groups such as methoxy, hydroxyl, and carbonyl. Lignin is regarded as a green raw material for forming renewable biofuels and value-added raw chemicals [6–8]. Cellulose is composed of straight-chain d-glucose monomers and decomposes around 240–350 °C [3]. Intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds that support the crystalline structure of cellulose are made between the three -OH groups on each glucose monomer [9]. Hemicellulose is made up of different monomers, including glucose, mannose, arabinose, and xylose [10]. Xylan, the most abundant monomeric unit of hemicellulose, is commonly used in research studies [11]. Zhou et al. [12] investigated the effect of interactions between the biomass components on PAHs formation under fast pyrolysis conditions and noted that the bio-oils from xylan and lignin were rich in 2–4 ring PAHs structures. Zheng and coworkers [13] conducted a comparative analysis on catalytic pyrolysis of biomass constituents and found that bio-oil samples from non-catalytic cellulose pyrolysis were rich in levoglucosan and other anhydrosugars, while the bio-oil from xylan was found to be rich in furans, and lignin produced bio-oils containing phenols. During catalytic pyrolysis, xylan mostly formed monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (74.60%), cellulose had a high selectivity for naphthalene, while lignin showed high selectivity for the formation of PAHs [13]. PAHs are defined as aromatic species having two or more aromatic rings bonded together. According to the literature, PAHs are typically produced during incomplete/partial combustion of hydrocarbons [14,15] and biomass [16] during bio-char production [16,17], and as a result of high-temperature pyrolysis of fuels [18]. Owing to their nature, PAHs are used as precursors in photovoltaic cells, field-effect transistors (FETs) [19], production of 2D graphite or graphene, and 3D carbon nanotube sources, that exhibits excellent optical, electrical, and mechanical properties [20]. Diels-Alder cycloaddition and HACA reaction pathways have since been proposed for the formation of PAHs [14,21–23]. Liu et al. [24] studied how the meta, para, and ortho positions on the aromatic ring affect the formation of PAHs during the HACA-based mass growth process. They concluded that the entire HACA reaction network included 186 fundamental reactions, starting from C6H6-C10H8, C10H8- C12H8- C14H10, and C14H10– C16H10 [24]. Pyrolysis conditions may significantly influence the yield and composition of products. The pressurized pyrolysis of biomass has been considered as an effective technique to enhance the selective production of target products [25–27]. Basiel et al. [28] investigated the impact of pressure on the pyrolysis of switchgrass Alamo, corn stalk, switchgrass Trailblazer, and poplar using a pressurized Differential Scanning Calorimetry, and concluded that increasing pyrolysis pressure resulted in the heat demand during pyrolysis and an increase in the char yields. This observation was credited to inhibit the high molecular weight volatiles from being released [28]. Xu and coworkers [29] used a fixed-bed pressurized reactor to analyze the effect of pressure (5.0 MPa) on pine sawdust pyrolysis. Their experimental results indicated that pressure played a significant role in the production of H2, CH4, and CO2 in the bio-gas by promoting secondary cracking (deoxygenation, dehydrogenation) of bio-oil [29]. Ateş et al. [30] used a pressurized fixed-bed reactor to study the impact of pressure on the pyrolysis behavior of dried distillers grains and canola seed press cake. They observed that the yields of gas and char increased with pressure, and that pressure promoted the formation of H2. Kongkasawan and coworkers [31] used a bench-scale batch pressure reactor to investigate the pyrolysis of Jatropha waste meal at 0.69 MPa. They reported that phenols and hydrocarbons were the major constituents of bio-oil. Maliutina et al. [26] conducted the pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae and noticed an enhancement in the yield of hydrogen up to 88.01 vol%, and nitrogen-containing organic compounds (isoquinoline, phenanthridine, indinole, quinoline). A recent study by the authors [25] on high-pressure pyrolysis of palm kernel shell in an entrained-flow reactor showed that higher pressures and temperature promoted the yields of PAHs up to 96.17 GC–MS area%, and H2 yield up to 40.82 gH2/Kg.PKS [25]. Previous studies were mainly focused on the pyrolysis of biomass, while the detailed information on the decomposition behavior of lignocellulosic biomass components is scarce, in particular, under pressurized entrained flow pyrolysis conditions. Our previous study showed the potential of pressurized entrained flow pyrolysis for the selective production of PAHs and H2 gas from biomass [25]. However, the mechanism of reaction pathways was not clearly understood. Despite the demonstrated advantages of high-pressure pyrolysis in the efficient conversion of biomass, the mechanism of reaction pathways and the behavior of biomass constituents under the pressurized pyrolysis conditions is not well understood and requires further investigation. Therefore, in this study, representative components of lignocellulosic biomass, i.e., lignin, xylan, and cellulose, were used, aiming to gain a better understanding of the thermal decomposition behavior of each component under pressurized pyrolysis conditions and establish their contribution to the selectivity of target compounds. This investigation contributes to the knowledge of biomass pyrolysis, in particular the mechanism of thermal decomposition of each lignocellulosic biomass component under elevated pressures and fast heating rates."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corn-based Xylan (J1817069) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation and used in this study as a representative material for hemicellulose. Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC 102) and lignin from wood pulp (FH-1000) were obtained from Shanghai Yingjia Industrial Development Co., LTD. The proximate analysis and elemental composition of the three bio-components are shown in Table 1 . The ash contents and volatile matter were calculated following the E1755 and ASTM E872 standards, respectively. A Euro Vector (Euro EA) was used to measure the elemental composition of the bio-component samples."
3,High pressure entrained-flow experimental setup,"2.2 High pressure entrained-flow experimental setup A high-pressure entrained-flow pyrolysis rig was utilized in this investigation. The details of the experimental rig are described in our previous studies [25,26]. The pyrolysis runs were operated at temperatures ranging between 600 and 900 °C, at 0.1, 1.0, and 4.0 MPa. Approximately 30 g of the dry lignin, cellulose, and xylan were fed into the reacting zone via a screw feeder. N2 gas with a high purity of 99.9999% was used as the sweep gas, the flow rate of which was controlled to achieve a particle residence time of 5–6 s in the pyrolysis/reaction zone. The accuracy of the experimental runs was confirmed by repeating the test runs for at least three times and obtaining the experimental errors."
4,Product yields calculation,"2.3 Product yields calculation Volatile matter and char yields of the biomass components were calculated by the ash tracer method [32], shown as Eq. (1): (1) Y VM = 1 − X bc X 1 − X bc where Y VM is the yield of volatiles in (wt%, daf), and X and X bc represent ash content of the char and the raw biomass components, accordingly. The yields of bio-gas and bio-oil were calculated by difference and by direct weighing, respectively."
5,Product characterization,2.4 Product characterization The bio-oil composition was examined using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) Thermo Scientific ISQ. The detailed specifications of the GC–MS and the bio-oil analysis procedure are described elsewhere [26]. The bio-oil and bio-char elemental compositions were analyzed by a Euro Vector elemental analyzer (Euro EA). The light gas produced was examined using a 490 micro-gas chromatography (micro-GC). The specifications of the micro-GC analysis have been detailed in our previous study [33].
6,Results and discussion,
7,Pyrolysis products yields,"3.1 Pyrolysis products yields The yields of products from the entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignin, cellulose, and xylan under pressure are described in Table 2 . The product yield results showed that the pyrolysis of lignin resulted in the formation of more char, while cellulose and xylan produced the most gas and bio-oil, respectively. These results agreed with the proximate analysis of biomass components (Table 1) and the literature data [12]. Increasing the pyrolysis pressure promoted the yield of bio-oil for lignin, cellulose, and xylan. At 700 °C, the lignin-derived bio-oil increased from 41.49 wt% under atmospheric pressure and peaked to 45.54 wt% under 1.0 MPa pyrolysis setup. At 900 °C, the lignin bio-oil formation was promoted from 24.49 wt% under 0.1 MPa and reached a peak yield of 44.59 wt% at 4.0 MPa. Cellulose derived bio-oil showed a similar trend to that of lignin. At 700 °C, the cellulose bio-oil increased from 37.71 wt% at 0.1 MPa to 38.93 wt% at 2.0 MPa. At 900 °C, the yield of bio-oil increased from 7.24 wt% at 0.1 MPa and peaked to 28.80 wt% at 4.0 MPa. For xylan, the maximum bio-oil yield of 87.40 wt% was observed at 700 °C and 4.0 MPa. At 900 °C, a significant increase in xylan bio-oil from 15.44 wt% at atmospheric pressure to 80.05 wt% at 4.0 MPa was evident. Elevated pressures are thought to lead to increased cross-linking and condensation reactions due to the increased retention time of volatiles in bio-char, thus leading to higher yields of bio-oil. Further research is needed to clarify this observation. The yields of cellulose and xylan bio-gas with process variables followed an opposite trend to that of bio-oil. At 700 °C, the yield of cellulose bio-gas decreased from 60.56 wt% at atmospheric pressure to 49.7 wt% at 4.0 MPa. Similarly, the formation of xylan-derived bio-gas was hindered with pressure, decreasing from 46.08 wt% under atmospheric pressure to 11.64 wt% at 4.0 MPa. At 900 °C, the yield of bio-gas from cellulose and xylan decreased sharply from 92.52 wt% and 84.54 wt% at atmospheric pressure to 70.55 wt% and 19.4 wt% at elevated pressure. At 700 °C, the yield of lignin bio-gas decreased from 9.58 wt% to 6.28 wt% at 4.0 MPa. The yields of bio-char from cellulose and xylan were significantly low, with the highest yield being 4.17 wt% (900 °C,1.0 MPa) and 4.91 wt% (800 °C, 4.0 MPa), respectively. These results agreed with the high volatile matter and low fixed‑carbon contents in raw cellulose and xylan samples."
8,Impact of pyrolysis parameters on lignin pyrolysis products,"3.2 Impact of pyrolysis parameters on lignin pyrolysis products 3.2.1 Lignin bio-oil composition Fig. 1 displays the changes occurring in lignin bio-oil samples when subjected to different pyrolysis conditions. Phenolics, single-ring aromatic hydrocarbons (SRAHCs), poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons (SAHCs), aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and acids were the main organic species produced from the thermal decomposition of lignin [13]. Fig. 1a illustrates the impact of temperature on the bio-oil at 4.0 MPa. Raising the temperature from 600 °C to 900 °C, the concentrations of SAHCs, SRAHCs, and phenolics decreased from 30.66 area% to 0.00 area%, 1.68 area% to 0.00 area%, and 6.4 area% to 1.53 area%, respectively. Conversely, the formation of PAHs was significantly promoted with temperature, reaching a maximum of 85.72 area% at 900 °C pyrolysis temperature. The decrease in phenolics and SRAHCs can be attributed to the formation of phenyl radicals at high temperatures and pressures, acting as a precursor to initiating the growth of PAHs [12,25,34]. The thermal cracking of SAHCs and free radical chain reactions may result in the formation of saturated hydrocarbons, which in turn may form PAHs via Diels-Alder reactions [35]. The sharp increase in the concentration of PAHs during lignin pyrolysis can be as a result of different factors such as (Scheme 1 ): (1) thermal degradation of lignin since lignin is aromatic in nature [35,36]; (2) via HACA reactions with the phenyl radicals formed from phenolics and SRAHCs acting as precursors [12,35]; (3) through a series of Diels-Alder and HACA reactions of saturated hydrocarbons formed from the cracking of SAHCs and carbonyls. Fig. 1b and c shows the transformation of lignin bio-oil with pressure at 700 °C and 900 °C. At 700 °C and atmospheric pressure, the bio-oil mainly contained PAHs, SAHCs, phenolics, and traces of carbonyls, acids, and alcohols. Raising the pressure from 0.1 MPa to 4.0 MPa drastically changed the composition of lignin bio-oil. SAHCs decreased sharply from 62.52 area% under atmospheric pressure to 15.43 area% at 4.0 MPa, while PAHs increased from 5.91 area% at 0.1 MPa, reaching the highest value of 74.90 area% at 1.0 MPa. These observations were credited to the thermal cracking of SAHCs forming saturated hydrocarbons, which underwent Diels-Alder cycloaddition and HACA reactions to form PAHs [35]. Esters, aldehydes, acids, and alcohols were only detected under atmospheric pressure. The dominant organic species in bio-oil at 900 °C were PAHs and SAHCs. Phenolics, acids, and esters were detected in low quantities with a combined concentration of less than 4.00 area%. The SAHCs decreased from 67.49 area% at 0.1 MPa to 10.37 area% at 1.0 MPa and were not detected at higher pressures. Meanwhile, PAHs dramatically increased from 3.10 area% at 0.1 MPa and peaked at 4.0 MPa, reaching 85.72 area%. These results also suggested that SAHCs underwent cycloaddition reactions at high pressure and temperature to form aromatic compounds, which acted as starting material for PAHs ring growth via HACA reactions. Fig. 2a displays the changes in the PAHs in lignin bio-oil with the temperature at 4.0 MPa. The PAHs included naphthalene, biphenylene (2-ring), phenanthrene, fluorine (3-ring), pyrene, and fluoranthene (4-ring). The dominant PAHs in lignin bio-oil were 3-ring PAHs (phenanthrene) and 2-ring PAHs (naphthalene). The formation of phenanthrene (11.44–25.16 area%) and fluoranthene (2.9–12.2 area%) increased with temperature up to 800 °C. Pyrene showed a similar trend, reaching 12.18 area% at 900 °C. Fig. 2b illustrates that the formation of phenanthrene and pyrene was promoted at 1.0 MPa. The concentration of naphthalene followed a similar trend, peaking at 4.0 MPa. Based on these results, at 700 °C, the dominant PAHs in the lignin bio-oil samples were in the order of 3-rings >4-rings >2-rings. Fig. 2c shows that at 900 °C and atmospheric pressure, bio-oil was dominated by naphthalene, pyrene, and fluoranthene. Raising the pressure to 4.0 MPa, the concentration of naphthalene topped at 22.30 area%. Phenanthrene and fluorene were first formed at 1.0 MPa and further promoted at 4.0 MPa. Fluoranthene and pyrene peaked at 1.0 MPa and then diminished as the pressure was further increased. The most dominant PAHs observed in the lignin bio-oil under 900 °C pyrolysis setup were 3-, 4-, and 2-ring compounds. The structure of lignin may play a significant role in the type of PAHs formed during the thermal decomposition. The primary products from lignin pyrolysis, such as phenolics, SRAHCs, and PAHs, are aromatic [37]. The thermal degradation of lignin generates phenyl radicals [38], which then act as precursors for PAHs formation via HACA reactions [25]. Consequently, the formation of a single ring radical to LMW-PAHs (2–3- ring) and HMW- PAHs (4-ring) can take place rapidly. Hence the dominant PAHs in lignin bio-oil were high-molecular-weight species. As discussed above, lignin produced a high amount of SAHCs that was believed to have undergone thermal cracking and free radical generation to form aromatic hydrocarbons, and finally, PAHs via HACA reactions. 3.2.2 Lignin bio-gas composition Fig. 3 shows the transformation of lignin light gas composition with respect to temperature and pressure. The analyzed gases were CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, and H2. Fig. 3a shows the changes in bio-gas composition from 600 to 900 °C under 4.0 MPa. In pyrolysis runs conducted under pressure, the bio-gas was dominated by H2 gas, the concentration of which increased steadily from 65.26 vol% to 77.36 vol% at 700 °C and 900 °C. The increase in H2 gas concentration was attributed to the release of hydrogen radicals during the formation of PAHs through HACA reactions, and also during the thermal cracking and free radical reaction of SAHCs [35]. Conversely, the concentrations of CH4, CO2, and C2H6 decreased sharply with temperature, from 17.29 vol% to 10.11 vol%, 10.01 vol% to 5.29 vol%, and 0.80 vol% to 0.15 vol% at 600 °C and 900 °C, respectively. However, CO showed an increasing trend from 6.63 vol% to 12.34 vol% at 600 °C and 900 °C, respectively. CH4, CO2, CO, and C2H6 can be formed during the primary decomposition/degradation of lignin and the free radical reaction of acids, alcohols, and carbonyls. H2 was the major gaseous component during the pyrolysis of lignin. Fig. 3b and c shows the composition of lignin bio-gas at 700 °C and 900 °C in relation to pressure. The increase in pressure led to a higher concentration of H2. The highest concentration of H2 during lignin pyrolysis (77.36 vol%) was obtained at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa. Meanwhile, the concentrations of C2H6 and CO decreased with pressure, while CH4 showed a similar trend to H2. The analysis of the non-condensable volatile matter produced at elevated pressure showed that pressure enhanced the formation and transformation of Hydrogen into the gaseous phase."
9,Effects of process conditions on cellulose pyrolysis products,"3.3 Effects of process conditions on cellulose pyrolysis products 3.3.1 Composition of cellulose bio-oil Fig. 4 describes the impact of process conditions on the pyrolysis of cellulose. Fig. 4a displays the changes with temperature (600–900 °C) at 4.0 MPa. The thermal degradation/decomposition of cellulose under temperature and pressure resulted in the formation of phenolics, SRAHCs, PAHs, SAHCs, sugars, acids, alcohols, and carbonyls being formed. Phenolics and sugars decreased to a greater extent at elevated pyrolysis temperatures. The concentration of phenolics declined from 16.10 area% at 600 °C to 1.86 area% under at 700 °C, while no phenolics were detected at 800 °C and 900 °C. Sugars were only detected in cellulose-derived bio-oil at 600 °C (1.55 area%) and were thermally decomposed at higher temperatures. SRAHCs increased slightly from 3.99 area% at 600 °C to 4.23 area% at 700 °C, and then to 1.15 area% at 800 °C, while no SRAHCs were measured at 900 °C. The slight increase of SRAHCs can partly be due to the generation of aromatic compounds through the decomposition and reconstruction of sugars/glucose compounds [39]. With increasing the temperature from 600 °C to 900 °C, PAHs dominated the bio-oil by increasing from 51.30 area% to 96.13 area%, respectively. These results further demonstrated that elevated temperatures significantly favored the selective generation of PAHs. As shown in Scheme 1, the generation of PAHs during pressurized pyrolysis of cellulose can be attributed to: (1) phenolics and SRAHCs forming Phenyl radicals that act as precursors in HACA reaction pathway, (2) decomposition and reconstruction of glucose to form aromatic hydrocarbons, and (3) through a combination of Diels-Alder cycloaddition and HACA reactions of carbonyls, acids, and SAHCs. Fig. 4b–c displays the composition of cellulose bio-oil with respect to pressure at 700 °C and 900 °C. At 700 °C, the bio-oil contained phenolics, SRAHCs, PAHs, sugars, acids, carbonyls, and alcohols. The SRAHCs decreased with pressure from 13.17 area% under atmospheric pressure to 2.10 area% at 1.0 MPa and finally to 1.62 area% at 4.0 MPa. Sugars, alcohols, and carbonyls were only observed under atmospheric pressure. Pressure also hindered the formation of phenolics, decreasing from 13.54 area% at 0.1 MPa to 6.07 area% at 1.0 MPa and 3.77 area% at 4.0 MPa. Conversely, PAHs increased monotonically with pressure, reaching a maximum concentration of 81.76 area% at 4.0 MPa. Under 900 °C and at atmospheric pressure, the cellulose bio-oil was comprised of phenolics, SRAHCs, PAHs, sugars, acids, and the SAHCs. At 4.0 MPa, phenolics and SRAHCs were no longer detected, suggesting that at elevated temperatures and pressures, they were transformed into PAHs, the concentration of which increased from 74.33 to 98.38 area% from 0.1 to 4.0 MPa. PAHs were the only species detected in cellulose bio-oil at 4.0 MPa. These results concluded that both temperature and pressure significantly influenced the selective production of PAHs from cellulose. Fig. 5a shows the changes in the type of PAHs at 4.0 MPa in relation to temperature. The formation of phenanthrene, naphthalene, pyrene, biphenylene, and fluorene was promoted up to 800 °C. It was postulated that at elevated temperatures, the 2-ring PAHs were transformed into 3-rings PAHs, and subsequently to 4-ring PAHs via the ring growth mechanism [25]. At 600 °C and 700 °C, naphthalene (2-ring) was the main PAHs observed in the bio-oil. Higher temperatures of 800 °C and 900 °C led to the growth of PAHs, in particular, forming phenanthrene, pyrene, and fluoranthene. The thermal breakdown of cellulose at 700 °C and 0.1 MPa produced trace amounts of phenanthrene, pyrene, biphenylene, fluorine, and fluoranthene (Fig. 5b). The generation of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene were promoted at higher pressures. Consequently, a decrease in the concentration of naphthalene was noticed, suggesting that naphthalene acted as a precursor for larger PAHs. At 900 °C (Fig. 5c), the most dominant PAH, at all the pressures studied, was naphthalene. Increasing the pressure from atmospheric to 4.0 MPa led to lower concentrations of naphthalene, while pyrene, phenanthrene, and fluoranthene increased steadily. The decrease in biphenylene at 4.0 MPa resulted in the generation of biphenyl, which can act as a precursor for phenanthrene via the HACA process (Scheme 1) [26]. This part of the research showed that cellulose derived bio-oil was rich in 2-ring PAHs, particularly naphthalene. Cellulose is non-aromatic and is formed by linear polysaccharides, which comprise d-glucose monomers bonded by β-(1–4) glycosidic bonds [40]. The thermal degradation of cellulose usually forms sugars such as levoglucosan and anhydrosugars [13,41]. However, under high heating rates in this study, cellulose was transformed to phenolics, PAHs, SRAHCs, carbonyls, and acids. As shown in Scheme 1, glucose/sugars can go through decomposition and reconstruction to form aromatic compounds such as phenolics and SRAHCs, which can be further converted to PAHs via HACA pathways. 3.3.2 Changes in cellulose bio-gas Fig. 6 shows the transformation of bio-gas from cellulose pyrolysis. As seen in Fig. 6a, the generation of H2 was promoted with temperature, increasing from 58.16 vol% at 600 °C and reaching the peak concentration of 73.97 vol% at 900 °C. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in concentration of CH4, C2H6, CO, and CO2. CH4 decreased from 15.27 to 11.33 vol% from 600 to 900 °C, C2H6 from 0.98 vol% to 0.14 vol%, CO from 15.33 vol% to 9.59 vol%, and CO2 from 10.39 vol% to 4.96 vol%. Fig. 6b illustrates the changes in the light gas fraction from cellulose with pressure at 700 °C. By enhancing the pyrolysis pressure from 0.1 to 4.0 MPa, H2 concentration decreased steadily from 70.47 vol% to 61.81 vol%. This trend was opposite to what was observed in lignin pyrolysis. C2H6 and CO showed an increasing trend with pressure. The concentration of CH4 increased from 9.1 Vol% to 15.11 vol% and CO2 from 3.02 vol% to 4.98 vol%. Fig. 6c shows the change in the gas composition at 900 °C. The concentration of H2 decreased steadily from 80.49 vol% to 73.97 vol% from 0.1 to 4.0 MPa. C2H6 and CO also showed a declining trend from 1.98 vol% to 0.14 vol% and from 10.71 vol% to 9.59 vol%. Conversely, the concentrations of CH4 and CO2 increased from 5.19 vol% to 11.33 vol%, and 1.99 vol% to 4.98 vol%, respectively. The decreasing trend of H2 concentration was opposite to that of lignin. This observation can be attributed to the type of PAHs formed during the cellulose pyrolysis. The release of hydrogen during the generation of PAHs via the HACA reactions has been reported to contribute to the formation of H2 [25,26,33]. However, as discussed above, unlike lignin, the cellulose bio-oil was dominated by 2-ring PAHs (mostly naphthalene), and the formation of larger PAHs was constrained. This led to a limited release of hydrogen radicals during the pyrolysis of cellulose, and consequently, lower concentrations of H2 in the gaseous phase."
10,Impact of pyrolysis conditions on xylan pyrolysis,"3.4 Impact of pyrolysis conditions on xylan pyrolysis 3.4.1 Composition of xylan bio-oil Fig. 7a illustrates the transformation of the xylan bio-oil composition with temperature (600–900 °C) at a constant pressure of 4.0 MPa. The organic species identified in the xylan derived bio-oil were similar to that of cellulose. The main organic species detected in xylan bio-oil were phenolics, SRAHCs, PAHs, SAHCs, sugars, alcohols, acids, and carbonyls. The changes in the formation of phenolics with temperature at 4.0 MPa showed a different trend to lignin or cellulose. The concentration of phenolics increased from 0.97 area% at 600 °C, reaching 3.94 area% at 800 °C and then declined to 2.35 area% at 900 °C. The SRAHCs showed a similar trend to cellulose and lignin, decreasing from 3.34 area% at 600 °C to 0.66 area% at 900 °C. PAHs increased monotonically with temperature, reaching 91.79 area% at 900 °C. The SAHCs and acids were only present at 600 °C and were decomposed at higher temperatures. Fig. 7b and c shows the composition of xylan bio-oil in relation to pressure at 700 °C and 900 °C, respectively. At 700 °C and atmospheric pressure, the GC–MS chromatograms of the analyzed bio-oil displayed a mixture of phenolics, SRAHCs, PAHs, SAHCs, sugars, alcohols, acids, and carbonyls. Adding the pressure to 4.0 MPa resulted in a decrease in phenolics from 22.13 area% to 2.53 area%. The SRAHCs showed a similar trend with pyrolysis pressure. SRAHCs decreased from 4.89 area% at 0.1 MPa to 1.92 area% at 4.0 MPa. The formation of sugars and aldehydes was completely hindered when the pressure of 4.0 MPa was used. Similarly, the SAHCs, esters, acids, and alcohols were only observed at atmospheric pressure. The generation of PAHs was enhanced at elevated pressures, increasing from 38.70 area% under atmospheric pressure to 88.83 area% at 4.0 MPa. The xylan bio-oils obtained from experiments conducted at 900 °C were dominated by PAHs and only showed small traces of phenolics, SRAHCs, sugars, SAHCs, acids, and carbonyls. Pyrolysis at higher pressures hindered the formation of phenolics, sugars, SAHCs, acids, and carbonyls. The concentration of PAHs was promoted from 77.72 area% at atmospheric pressure and reached the highest of 93.79 area% at 1.0 MPa. The PAHs detected in xylan bio-oil were naphthalene, biphenylene, phenanthrene, fluorine, fluoranthene, and pyrene. As shown in Fig. 8a, at 600 °C (4.0 MPa), naphthalene was not detected. However, its derivatives such as 2-methly-naphthalene, 1-ethylnaphthalene, 1-,7-dimethylnaphthalene were present in the bio-oil. Naphthalene was detected above 700 °C, peaking at 800 °C. Phenanthrene increased monotonically with temperature. Biphenylene and fluorene decreased as the pyrolysis temperature was increased. Similar to cellulose, naphthalene and its derivatives were the most dominant PAHs in xylan bio-oil. Fig. 8b illustrates the change in the type of PAHs at 700 °C with respect to pressure. As seen, the generation of phenanthrene, pyrene, and naphthalene was promoted at higher pressures. The concentrations of biphenylene, fluorine, and fluoranthene peaked at 1.0 MPa and decreased slightly at 4.0 MPa. Fig. 8c describes the change in the type of PAHs in xylan bio-oil with pressure at 900 °C. The formation of naphthalene increased sharply when the pressure was elevated from atmospheric to 1.0 MPa. This phenomenon can be accredited to the ring growth mechanism via HACA reaction pathways [35]. Phenanthrene and pyrene also showed an increasing trend with pressure, confirming that the ring-growth mechanism was prevalent during the pressurized pyrolysis of xylan. Biphenylene, on the other hand, showed a decreasing trend with pressure. Biphenylene can be transformed into biphenyl and act as a precursor for phenanthrene [26]. The slight decrease in fluoranthene at 1.0 MPa corresponded with the generation of 5-ring PAHs such as benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(j)fluoranthene, and benzo(ghi)fluoranthene. The chemical structure of xylan had a significant impact on the types of PAHs produced during pressurized pyrolysis. Xylan is non-aromatic and composed of monomers such as glucose, mannose, xylose, and arabinose [10]. It is postulated that xylan underwent similar reaction pathways to cellulose. It was found that the decomposition of xylan led to the formation of a similar range of products, however with a higher content of phenolics, SRAHCs, carbonyls, and PAHs. The major PAHs in xylan bio-oils were 2-ring PAHs, in particular naphthalene. However, xylan formed larger amounts of HMW-PAHs than cellulose, which is due to the higher decompose rate of xylan compared with cellulose [42]. The activation energy (Ea) for the thermal decomposition of xylan (95.39 KJ/mol) is lower than cellulose (199.66 KJ/mol) [41]. As a result, the formation of PAHs taskes place faster than cellulose, increasing the possibility of the formation of HMW-PAHs through the ring growth mechanism (Scheme 1). 3.4.2 Composition of xylan bio-gas Fig. 9 displays the changes in xylan bio-gas composition in relation to pyrolysis conditions. Fig. 9a shows that the changes in H2 gas with temperature at 4.0 MPa displayed a similar trend to lignin and cellulose. The volumetric concentration of hydrogen gas increased from 71.64 to 77.10 vol% at 600 °C and 900 °C, respectively. Conversely, CH4, and C2H6 displayed a decreasing trend when the temperature was increased from 600 °C to 900 °C. Meanwhile, the concentration of CO declined from 7.45 vol% at 600 °C to 5.78 vol% at 800 °C and then slightly increased to 7.52 vol% at 900 °C. Fig. 9b shows the change in bio-gas composition with respect to pressure at 700 °C. The concentrations of H2, CH4, and CO2 displayed an increasing trend with pressure. By raising the pyrolysis pressure from 0.1 to 4.0 MPa, H2 increased from 72.74 vol% to 74.41 vol%, while the generation of CH4 and CO2 were enhanced from 7.88 vol% to 10.04 vol%, and from 3.87 vol% to 7.69 vol%. On the other hand, C2H6 and CO decreased from 2.68 vol% to 0.74 vol%, and from 12.84 vol% to 7.12 vol%. Fig. 9c shows that the changes in H2 at 900 °C was different to that at lower temperatures. With elevating the pressure to 4.0 MPa, H2 decreased from 81.32 vol% to 77.1 vol%. The reduction in hydrogen gas concentration can be credited to the type of PAHs formed during pyrolysis at 900 °C and elevated pressures. The xylan bio-oil was dominated by 2-ring PAHs (mostly naphthalene). As hydrogen was mainly formed during the ring-growth mechanism via HACA reactions, the limited growth of PAHs during xylan pyrolysis led to a decreased generation of hydrogen radicals, thus resulting in lower H2 concentrations in the bio-gas."
11,Mechanism of formation of PAHs during pressurized pyrolysis of lignocellulosic bio-components,"3.5 Mechanism of formation of PAHs during pressurized pyrolysis of lignocellulosic bio-components Scheme 1 illustrates the possible reaction routes that can lead to the formation of LMW-PAHs and HMW-PAHs. The thermal decomposition of lignin under lower pyrolysis pressures resulted in bio-oil samples that were mainly rich in SAHCs, SRAHCs, and phenolics. Increasing the pressure and temperature may result in Phenolics and SRAHCs, aromatic radicals that can act as starting material for PAHs by ring growth through HACA reactions [12,25,35]. The HACA pathway may continue to form HMW-PAHs. The SAHCs in lignin bio-oils can undergo a series of thermal cracking and free radical and Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions when subjected to elevated pyrolysis temperatures and pressures to form LMW-PAHs and HMW-PAHs. The thermal cracking/decomposition, breakage of CC bonds in cellulose and xylan at lower temperatures usually forms bio-oils dominated by sugars such as levoglucosan and anhydrosugars [13,41]. However, under high heating rates and elevated pressures which were used in this study, cellulose and xylan were transformed to phenolics, PAHs, SRAHCs, carbonyls, and acids. As illustrated in Scheme 1, glucose/sugars may undergo decomposition and reconstruction to form aromatic compounds such as phenolics and SRAHCs, which can be further converted to PAHs via HACA pathways. Carbonyls and acids may be converted to PAHs via Diels-Alder and HACA reaction pathways. During lignin pyrolysis and under low pyrolysis pressure (0.1 MPa), the bio-oil composition consisted of phenolics, single-ring aromatic hydrocarbons (SRAHCs), poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons (SAHCs), aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and acids. As the pyrolysis pressure was increased, it was observed that the formation of PAHs increased significantly at the expense of other species (illustrated as scheme 1). SRAHCs and phenolics are believed to have formed phenyl radicals [25,34], which acted as precursors for the formation of PAHs via the hydrogen abstraction acetylene addition reaction pathways [12,25,35]. The SAHCs underwent cycloaddition reactions at high pressures and temperatures to form aromatic compounds, which facilitated PAHs ring growth via HACA reactions [35]. Owing to the structure of lignin, higher molecular weight PAHs were found to be dominant in lignin-derived bio-oil, as it is aromatic in nature [36] and can easily form HMW PAHs. In the cases of cellulose and xylan, the thermal degradation of cellulose and xylan under low heating rates usually leads to the formation of sugars such as levoglucosan and anhydrosugars [13,41]. However, under high heating rates in this study, cellulose and xylan were transformed to phenolics, PAHs, SRAHCs, carbonyls, and acids. Similar to lignin pyrolysis, the formation of PAHs was promoted at elevated temperatures and pressures at the expense of other compounds. Glucose/sugars may undergo decomposition and reconstruction to form aromatic compounds such as phenolics and SRAHCs [39]; phenolics then undergo dihydroxylation reaction to form phenyl radicals, which act as precursors for the generation of PAHs [12,35]. The SRAHCs can also form phenyl radicals, which are believed to have acted as precursors for the formation of low molecular weight PAHs [10,42]. Carbonyls and acids may undergo a combination of Diels-Alder cycloaddition and HACA reaction pathways resulting in the formation of PAHs [35], as they were the only species observed at elevated pressures and temperatures. Due to the non-aromatic structure of cellulose and xylan [10,40], the main PAHs were mainly low molecular weight. Considering the short residence time of particle and gas inside the entrained-flow reactor, the chance of formation of large PAHs is limited. Hence, the dominant PAHs during the cellulose and xylan pyrolysis were 2-ring PAHs structures. Xylan formed larger amounts of PAHs than cellulose, which may be due to the higher decomposition rate of xylan compared with cellulose [42,43]. The activation energy for the thermal decomposition of xylan (95.39 KJ/mol) is lower than cellulose (199.66 KJ/mol) [41]. As a result, the reactions for the formation of PAHs occur faster than cellulose, increasing the possibility of the formation of PAHs through the ring growth mechanism pathways. The increase in H2 yield in lignin-derived bio-gas and the decrease in xylan and cellulose bio-gases can be accredited to the nature of the PAHs formed from the bio-components pyrolysis. The generation of PAHs via the HACA reaction pathways can release hydrogen radicals, which in turn contributes to the formation of H2 [25,26]. However, unlike lignin, cellulose and xylan bio-oils were dominated by 2-ring PAHs (primarily naphthalene), and the formation of larger PAHs was significantly limited. This can also be related to the non-aromatic structure of cellulose and xylan. This led to a limited release of hydrogen radicals during the pyrolysis of cellulose, and consequently, lower concentrations of H2 in the gaseous phase."
12,Conclusions,"• Pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignocellulosic bio-components was conducted, and the influence of temperature, pressure, and the type of biomass component on the generation of PAHs was systematically examined. • Pyrolysis of lignin at lower pressures resulted in the generation of bio-oils containing SAHCs, phenolics, and carbonyls. Elevating the pyrolysis temperatures and pressures led to a drastic increase in the yield of PAHs at the expense of other organic species. The concentration of PAHs in lignin bio-oil reached 85.72 area% at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa. • The compositional analysis of bio-oil showed that thermal decomposition of lignin at elevated temperatures and pressures mostly formed 4-ring and 3-ring PAHs. Under similar experimental conditions, cellulose and xylan formed 2-ring PAHs. The difference was credited to the molecular structure of the biomass component, where the aromatic nature of lignin promoted the ring growth and allowed the formation of larger molecular weight PAHs. • The results from this study showed that during pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, all biomass components contribute to the formation of PAHs. • Pressurized pyrolysis of biomass components promoted the selective generation of H2 in lignin-derived bio-gas, which was attributed to the aromatic nature of lignin, generating higher molecular weight PAHs as well as higher concentrations of H2 in the product gas, promoted by ring-growth mechanism via the HACA reactions. • This investigation showed that lignin pyrolysis under pressurized conditions is suitable for the production of HMW-PAHs and bio-gas rich in H2. At the same time, cellulose and xylan are suitable for the generation of LMW-PAHs, in particular naphthalene, and H2-rich bio-gas."
