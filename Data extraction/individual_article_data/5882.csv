0,Introduction,"Significant research attention has been focused to develop methodologies which could bring down CO2 levels in the atmosphere such that the hazards involved with global warming process could be curbed [1]. Currently, the majority of value-added chemicals are produced using CO as a C1 synthon which in turn is obtained by steam reforming of non-renewable, limited oil or natural gas resources. So in the last two decades, CO2 has emerged as a front runner for an alternative, sustainable C1 feed-stock compared to fossil fuel sources. Parallelly, it must be noted that the effective utilization of CO2 into value-added chemicals would critically depend on the production of H2 from non-fossil fuel based energy sources like electrolysis of water, solar water splitting etc. H 2 + CO 2 → catalyst HCOOH , CH 3 OH Among the different ways to utilize CO2, approaches based on conversion of CO2 into value added chemicals such as HCOOH, CH3OH etc. using transition metal catalysts are being actively pursued (eq 1) [2,3]. In this context, transition metal complexes possessing multidentate pincer scaffold for the activation and functionalization of CO2 has become increasingly prominent owing to their thermal stability, chelation rigidity and modulation of their electronic and steric properties [4]. The substituents on the pincer motif could readily be altered due to ease in synthesis and their catalytic activities could be evaluated. Thus, these ligands find applications in many areas such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, CC coupling reactions, CO2 activation and condensation reactions, etc. The most commonly employed pincer ligands relevant to the present work are shown in chart 1 . Among these, complexes with type (A) ligand HN(CH2CH2PR2)2 where R = isopropyl (iPr) substituent on phosphorus have been used for the activation of CO2. Hazari and co-workers reported conversion of CO2 into HCOOK using [IrH3(HN(CH2CH2PiPr2)2)] {HN(CH2CH2PiPr2)2 = iPrPNHP} complex as catalyst at 185 °C and 55 bar of total pressure (H2 + CO2) in the presence of 1 M aqueous KOH [5]. In addition to CO2 activation, the transition metal complexes of iPrPNHP ligand were used for the hydrogenation of carbonyl and imine substrates. Gusev et al. reported a series of metal hydride complexes such as trans-[ReH2(NO)(iPrPNHP)], mer-[IrH3(κ3-PNHN))] {PNHN – tBu2PC2H4NHC2H4NEt2} and [IrH3(iPrPNHP)] to be excellent catalysts for the hydrogenation of aldehydes, ketones, imines and α,β-unsaturated ketones, etc. [6] Hydrogenation of polar bonds such as those in carbonyl (R2C = O) and imine (R2C = N-R) moieties in organic substrates is an important reaction for the production of fine chemicals and building block reagents such as alcohols and amines respectively in pharmaceutical, fragrance and agricultural industry [7]. Direct hydrogenation in the presence of catalyst avoids the use of handling of stoichiometric, hazardous and air-sensitive reducing agents like NaBH4 and LiAlH4 and the subsequent waste generated after the workup [8,9]. Presence of different substituents in RPNHP (R = iPr, tBu, Ph) ligand could alter the electronic and steric profile at the metal center upon complexation. For example, Heinekey et al. studied the effect of substituents in RPOCOP (R = iPr, tBu) pincer skeleton with iridium complexes and have shown a dramatic effect on solubility, steric hindrance of substituents and reactivity upon changing the substituents on the pincer phosphorus [10]. Though very few early reports were documented on hydrogenation of cyclohexene using four coordinate Ir and Rh complexes [MCl(L)] {L = HN(CH2CH2PPh2)2 (PhPNHP), M = Ir, Rh} in mid 1980s, metal complexes of PhPNHP ligand remain largely unexplored and their synthetic routes and characterization, not well established. Indeed, the [MH2Cl(PhPNHP)] {M = Ir, Rh} complexes have been proposed as intermediates in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene using [MCl(L)] complexes under H2 atmosphere based on IR spectroscopy [11]. Recently, during the preparation of this manuscript, Casado et al. reported the synthesis of an extremely air sensitive four coordinate iridium amido complex [Ir(COE)(N(CH2CH2PPh2)2)] and demonstrated its utility in hydroamination of activated alkenes with NH3(g) and CH activation of alkynes [12]. In the present work, we have explored the untapped complexation potential of HN(CH2CH2PPh2)2 ligand with [M(COD)Cl]2 {M = Ir, Rh} precursor and investigated the potential of the resulting complexes in catalysis. During the course of study, a series of iridium and rhodium complexes, [M(COD)(PhPNHP)]Cl {M = Ir (1), Rh (2)}, [MH2Cl(PhPNHP)] {M = Ir (3), Rh (4)} and [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) supported by PhPNHP pincer ligand has been synthesized and well characterized. Complexes 1, 3, 4, and 6 were characterized by X-ray crystallography. The iridium trihydride complex [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) was found to be an active catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2, carbonyl, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, and imines substrates. The results will be discussed in this paper."

The yellow colored solution paled down. The volume of the solvent was reduced by purging CO2 through the solution before acquiring the NMR spectra. Attempts to isolate complex 7 were not successful because of its instability in the solid state."

Catalyst [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (0.006 g, 9.42 μmol) was weighed inside the glove box and transferred to a 25 mL Parr reactor vessel. Then, a small amount of THF (1 mL) and an aqueous solution of base were added (2–4 mL, 2–4 mmol). Finally, the reactor was pressurized with CO2 (7 bar) followed by H2 (7 bar) to a total pressure of 14 bar (1:1).

12,Results and discussion,
13,Synthesis and characterization of [IrH3(PhPNHP)] complex (6),"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of [IrH3(PhPNHP)] complex (6) The [IrH3(PhPNHP)] complex (6) was synthesized as shown in Scheme 1 . Treatment of [MCl(COD)]2 {M = Ir, Rh} precursor complex with pincer ligand HN-(CH2CH2PPh2)2 {PhPNHP} in THF gave [M(COD)(PhPNHP)]Cl {M = Ir (1), Rh (2)} complexes in excellent yields, 86 and 91%, respectively. The allylic and the vinylic protons of Ir-COD fragment appear at 1.43 (br s) and 3.92 (br s) ppm respectively, in the 1H NMR spectrum. Further, cooling the solution of complex 1 below 243 K, resulted in two different sets of signals for the allylic and the vinylic protons of COD moiety, respectively (S.M.). The NH hydrogen signal was noted downfield at 8.18 (br s) ppm suggesting that there could be possible NH⋯Cl interaction. In the IR spectrum, a broad band at 3370 cm−1 further supports hydrogen bonding interaction in this complex. Similar spectral features were noted for the Rh analogue. The PhPNHP ligand appeared at 15.00 (s) and 36.71 (d) ppm, respectively for complexes 1 and 2 in the 31P NMR spectra. The 1 J(Rh,P) was found to be 120 Hz. The [Rh(COD)(PhPNHP)]Cl (2) complex was found to be extremely air sensitive whereas, the iridium analogue 1, air stable. The NH in [M(COD)(PhPNHP)]Cl complexes readily get deprotonated by Et3N to form neutral complexes [M(COD)(PhPNP)] {M = Ir (1a), Rh (2a); PhPNP = N(CH2CH2PPh2)2} respectively along with the formation of Et3NHCl. Previously, Don Tilley et al. reported the synthesis of [Ir(COD)(PNP)]Cl complex via reaction of [Ir(COD)Cl]2 with PNP ligand having a rigid spacer (PNP = HN(2-PPh2-4-Me-C6H3)2) in toluene [23]. During the preparation of this manuscript, Casado et al. reported the synthesis and structural characterization of [Ir(COD)(PhPNHP)]Cl (1) complex [12]. Reaction of [M(COD)(PhPNHP)]Cl {M = Ir (1), Rh = (2)} complex with H2 (10 bar) at 70 °C in THF/1,4-dioxane solvent resulted in the oxidative addition of H2 to form the cis-dihydride [MH2Cl(PhPNHP)] {M = Ir (3), Rh (4)] complex. During the course of the reaction, COD gets hydrogenated into cyclooctane. Complexes 3 and 4 were isolated in moderate yields, 70 and 60% respectively. The IrH hydrogen signals were noted at −23.98 (td) and −19.04 (td) ppm with cis J(H,P) = 16 Hz in the 1H NMR spectrum of 3. The mutual coupling constant between the hydrides was found to be 7.5 Hz. Whereas, in the case of [RhH2Cl(PhPNHP)] complex 4, the hydride signals appeared at −18.74 (m) and −14.86 (m) ppm with J(H,Pcis) of 16 Hz and 2 J(H,H) of 9 Hz in the 1H NMR spectrum. Upon 31P decoupling, the J(Rh,H) was found to be 28 Hz (S M.). The origin of the difference in hydride chemical shifts between IrH and RhH could be traced to the electronic structure of 5d vs 4d metal center [24]. The NH hydrogen signal appeared at 4.19 (t) and 4.30 (t) ppm for complexes 3 and 4, respectively. In the 31P NMR spectrum, the PhPNHP ligand appeared at 26.31 (s) and 49.89 (d) ppm, respectively, for complexes 3 and 4. The J(Rh, P) coupling constant was found to be 120 Hz for complex 4. In the IR spectrum, a broad band was noted at 3386–3410 cm−1 for these complexes indicating hydrogen bonding interactions between NH⋯Cl (S.M). The rhodium complexes are highly air sensitive whereas, the iridium analogues are air stable. Complex 3 could also be synthesized by the reaction of [IrCl(COE)2]2 with the PhPNHP ligand under H2 (10 bar). The analogous Ir complex [IrH2Cl(iPrPNHP)] {iPrPNHP = HN-(CH2CH2PiPr2)2} was synthesized by reacting [Ir(COE)2Cl]2 with HN(CH2CH2PiPr2)2 in iPrOH at 80 °C [6]. Iluc and co-workers reported the formation of [IrH2Cl(PNP)] {PNP = N-di(2-diisopropylphosphine-4-methylphenyl-O-tolylamine)} complex via reaction of [Ir(COD)Cl]2 with PNP ligand under H2 atm. The PNP ligand has a rigid backbone based on arene moiety and the nitrogen is substituted by tolyl (tolyl = C6H4CH3) moiety [25]. Similarly, Goldman et al. reported the synthesis of [(tBufurPOP)RhH2Cl] {tBufurPOP = 2,5-bis((di-tert-butylphosphino)methyl)furan} complex through reaction of [Rh(NBD)Cl]2 (NBD = norbornadiene) with tBufurPOP ligand in toluene under 1 atm of H2 at 110 °C [26]. Reaction of [IrH2Cl(PhPNHP)] (3) complex with excess KOtBu/LiN(SiMe3)2 in C6D6/THF-d 8 resulted in the formation of a highly unstable 16-electron amido dihydride complex [IrH2(PhPNP)] (PNP = N(CH2CH2PPh2)2) (5) via elimination of KCl and tBuOH/LiCl and HN(SiMe3)2 respectively. A single hydride signal was noted at −20.10 (t) with a J(H,Pcis) of 10 Hz in the 1H NMR spectrum. The 31P NMR spectrum is comprised of a signal at 53.90 (s) ppm which is significantly upfield shifted compared to the starting material 3. Based on the NMR spectral characteristics, the geometry of complex 5 could be described as a trigonal bipyramid. The intermediate [IrH2(PNP)] (5) is too unstable to be explored for further reactions. On the other hand, a related complex [IrH2(iPrPNP)] (iPrPNP = N-(CH2CH2PiPr2)2) where the phosphine ligand bears isopropyl substituents has been isolated, suggesting the role of steric and electronic factors imparted by isopropyl substituents in stabilizing 16-electron species [6]. The iridium amido dihydride complex [IrH2(PhPNP)] (5) reacts rapidly with H2 (6–10 bar) to afford the iridium trihydride complex [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) wherein H2 is added across the IrN bond via 1,2-addition [27]. Fryzuk and his co-workers found that H2 adds across the IrN bond in [IrH2(PNP)] {PNP = N(SiMe2CH2PPh2)2} system to form H NIr H motif in an iridium amine trihydride complex [IrH3(PNHP)] {PNP = HN(SiMe2CH2PPh2)2}. Later, 1,2-addition reaction was observed in case of a few other systems based on Re and Ru pincer complexes [28]. It is now recognized as an important mode of bond activation in catalysis [29]. In contrast, the reaction of [IrH2(κ 3-PNN)] {PNN = tBu2PC2H4NC2H4NEt2} complex in which the pincer arms are unsymmetrical with H2 did not result in the formation of the anticipated trihydride complex, [IrH3(κ 3-PNHN)]. Instead, the presumed transient trihydride quickly dimerizes into a bridging hydride complex [IrH2(κ 2-PNHN)]2(μ-H)2 suggesting subtle electronic factors in stabilizing the trihydride systems [30]. During the course of investigation of chiral N-alkyl pincer ligands for hydrogenation reactions, Bianchini et al. isolated a facial trihydride complex [IrH3(PNRP)] (PNP = CH3CH2CH(Me)N(CH2CH2PPh2)2, R = CH(Me)CH2CH3) via reaction of [Ir(COD)(H)(PNP)] with H2 at room temperature [31]. The iridium trihydride [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) complex exists as two isomers: meridional (mer) and facial (fac), in the latter, the mutual trans arrangement of the strong trans influencing hydride ligands is avoided. From the 1H NMR spectrum, these two isomers were found to be in a 50:50 ratio. Eight sets of distinct ‘CH2’ signals in the range of 1.72–3.45 ppm were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum for both mer and fac isomers, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum of the mer isomer 6a shows two distinct hydride signals with identical triplet of doublet (td) pattern at −10.87 and −10.65 ppm (td) for the trans arrangement IrH moiety. The two trans hydrides were not equivalent. The coupling constants of J(H,Pcis) of 18.5 Hz and J(H,H) of 5 Hz were found. For the fac-isomer (6b), the hydride signals appear as a doublet of doublet pattern (dd) centered at −10.35 ppm with J(H,Ptrans) of 120 Hz and J(H,Pcis) of 17 Hz. The signal of the hydride trans to N appeared as a multiplet at −19.39 and −19.52 ppm for mer and fac isomers, respectively. The NH signal was noted at 5.26 (s) and 6.31 (t) respectively for the fac and mer isomers (S.M.) in the 1H NMR spectrum. The PhPNHP ligand appeared at 31.89 (s) and 27.43 (s) ppm for fac and mer isomers of [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6), respectively in the 31P NMR spectrum. A broad band at 3370 cm−1 in the IR spectrum suggests the presence of hydrogen bonding in complex 6."
14,X-ray crystal structures,"3.2 X-ray crystal structures ORTEP views of crystal structures of complexes 3 and 6 are shown in Fig. 1 . The crystal structures of [Ir(COD)(PhPNHP)]Cl (1) and [RhH2Cl(PhPNHP)] (4) complexes and the ball and stick packing of all the structures have been deposited in the S.M. In all of the structures, we were able to locate the hydrogen atoms bound to iridium and nitrogen from the difference Fourier maps and refined freely. The important bond lengths and bond angles of these complexes have been summarized in Table 2 . Complex 1 was crystallized in CH2Cl2/n-hexane solvent system. Casado et al. recently reported the structural characterization of complex 1 via crystallization in acetone/diethyl ether [12]. In the crystal lattice two CH2Cl2 molecules were found which facilitates extensive hydrogen bonding network in the solid state. The structural parameters of complex 1 compare fairly well with reported structure except marginal difference in the torsion angles of the Ir-COD fragment (C8C1C2C3 and C4C5C6C7) [12]. MH2Cl(PhPNHP)] {M = Ir (3), Rh (4)} complexes crystallize in triclinic (P-1) and monoclinic (P21/c) crystal systems, respectively. These complexes adopt a slightly distorted octahedral structure. The bond angles P(1)-M(1)-P(2) and N(1)-M(1)-H(1) are in the range of 165.26–166.97° and 175.40–178.67°, respectively. The ligand rearranges to meridional geometry as compared to facial arrangement in the starting complexes 1 and 2. One hydrogen atom was located trans to chloride and the other was located trans to the nitrogen atom. Additionally, extensive intra- (2.840 Å) and inter-molecular (2.515 Å) hydrogen bonding interactions between NH⋯Cl were found. The metrical parameters of complex [IrH2Cl(PhPNHP)] are comparable to the [IrH2Cl(iPrPNHP)] analogue 6. The bond distances and bond angles in [RhH2Cl(PhPNHP)] (4) are comparable to those of [(tBuXanPOP)RhH2Cl] (tBuXanPOP = 4,5-bis(di-tertbutylphosphino)-9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene) complex [26]. [IrH3(PhPNHP] (6) complex crystallizes in monoclinic crystal system in P21/c space group. The structure shows deviations from an ideal octahedral geometry. The P(1)-Ir(1)-P(2) and N(1)-Ir(1)-H(2) bond angles are 166.28 (4)° and 178.5 (15)°, respectively. The PhPNHP pincer ligand is arranged in a meridional geometry and the other three positions are taken up by hydrogen atoms. Two hydrogen atoms were located mutually trans to one another and the other hydrogen was located trans to the nitrogen donor. In the crystal packing weak intra- (2.691 Å) and inter-molecular (2.158 Å) NH⋯HIr dihydrogen bonding interactions were evident. Dihydrogen bond is an intriguing type of hydrogen bond where M−H (M = transition metal/main group element) acts an acceptor and XH (N, O) acts as a donor to constitute M−H⋯H−X interaction [32]. The strength of this interaction was estimated to be in the range 3–7 kcal/mol. Dihydrogen bonding has been recognized to play an important role in homogeneous catalysis where bi-functional/metal-ligand cooperative mechanism is involved [33]. It must be noted that the crystal structure of the catalytically active relevant iridium trihydride complexes [IrH3(PNHP)] and {PNHP = HN-(CH2CH2PiPr2)2 and HN(SiMe2CH2PPh2)2} has not been previously reported [34]. However, crystal structure of iridium trihydride [IrH3(PNP)] (PNP = lutidine based pincer scaffold) complex supported by pyridine derived pincer ligands have been reported [35]. Compared to complex 6, IrN (2.110(7) Å) bond distance is shorter and the IrP (2.252(2) Å) bond distance is longer in [IrH3(PNP)] (PNP = lutidine based pincer scaffold). The P(1)IrP(2) bond angle of 167.43 (8)° in [IrH3(PNP)] (PNP = lutidine based pincer scaffold) is comparable to that in complex 6. In the [IrH3(PNP)] (PNP = lutidine based pincer scaffold) complex, the pincer motif was found to adopt planar arrangement whereas in complex 6, the pincer moiety is non-planar. This is attributed to the ‘CH2’ spacer in the PhPNHP ligand."
15,Reaction of [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) with CO2,"3.3 Reaction of [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) with CO2 Reaction of the iridium trihydride complex [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) with CO2 (1 atm) under ambient conditions lead to the formation of the formate derivative [IrH2(η 1-OC(O)H)(PhPNHP)] (7) via insertion of CO2 into the IrH bond (eq 2). The 1H NMR spectrum of complex 7 is comprised of two hydride signals at −17.97 (td) and −27.07 (m) ppm with J(H,Pcis) of 13.5 Hz. The coupling between the inequivalent hydrides was found to be J(H,H) = 7 Hz. The signal for the formate moiety HCOO− was found at 9.08 (t) ppm with J(H,H) = 10 Hz. The NH signal was seen in the downfield region as a broad singlet at 8.08 ppm. The 31P NMR spectrum shows a signal at 31.63 ppm for the PhPNHP ligand. The carbonyl carbon of the formate group appears at 172.16 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum. These spectral characteristics are similar to those of other reported complexes. For example, reaction of trans-[ReH2(NO)(iPrPNHP)] with CO2 led to its facile insertion into the Re − H bond to form trans-[ReH(O2CH)(NO)(iPrPNHP)] [36]. Similarly, Bernskoetter et al. reported the formation of a formate complex [FeH(η 1-OC(O)H)(CN-R′)(iPrPNHP)] {R’ = 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl} via reaction of an unstable trans-[FeH2(CN-R’)(iPrPNHP)] complex with CO2 (1 atm). The Fe-formate complex decomposed slowly at room temperature in few hours. In addition to Fe-formate complex, few other unassigned products were noted in this reaction [37]. Attempts to isolate complex 7 were not successful because of its instability in the solid state. Image 2"
16,Catalytic hydrogenation of CO2,"3.4 Catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 Catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 was carried out at a total pressure of 14 bar of H2 and CO2 (1:1) in the presence of 1 M base (aq). The performance of the catalyst [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) was evaluated under different conditions and the data are summarized in Table 3 . In all cases small amount of THF was added to dissolve the catalyst. In the absence of the catalyst, formation of HCOOK was found to be negligible. An optimum catalyst loading of 0.2–0.4 mol % was used. The turn over number (TON) was calculated using Me3Si(CD2)2-CO2Na (sodium-3-trimethylsilylpropionate) as an internal standard by 1H NMR spectroscopy (S.M.). A maximum TON of 144 was obtained at room temperature using KOH as an aqueous base. The highest TOF of 47 h−1 was reached at 80 °C. Using KOH (aq) or NaOH (aq) as a base lead to the formation of KHCO3 and NaHCO3 along with HCOOK/HCOONa, respectively under the reaction conditions. This was confirmed by analysis of the reaction mixture using 13C NMR spectroscopy (S.M.). Comparable TONs of 65 and 50 were achieved when LiOH·H2O and NaOH were used as bases, respectively at 65 °C. Using [IrH2Cl(PhPNHP)] complex 3 as catalyst, a TON of 7 was achieved at room temperature in a duration of 24 h; however at 100 °C, a TON of 144 was reached in 14 h. The relatively low TON, though under mild conditions of complex 6 could be attributed to the instability of the catalyst in aqueous KOH solution. Also, the relatively high electrophilicity of the metal complex compared to other reported complexes due to the presence of phenyl group on the phosphorus would also contribute to the low TON. Nozaki et al. reported the formation of HCOOK in 1 M KOH (aq) solution from H2 and CO2 promoted by [IrH3(PNP)] (PNP = lutidine based pincer scaffold) catalyst with the highest TON and TOF of 350000 and 150000 h-1, respectively. The catalyst operates at 200 °C and 50 bar of total pressure of 1:1H2 and CO2 [35]. Hazari and co-workers investigated the role of secondary sphere interactions between NH fragment of pincer ligand and the oxygen atom of formate moiety in M-O C(O)H which facilitates the insertion of CO2 into IrH bond in [IrH3(iPrPNHP)] complex. The bifunctional behavior of the catalyst due to NH⋯OC(O)H−M interaction makes it a very active catalyst. This catalyst also operates at 185 °C and 55 bar of total pressure [5]. The proposed mechanism for the hydrogenation of CO2 in 1 M base (aq) is outlined in Scheme 2 . Attack of the nucleophilic trans IrH bond onto CO2 in the first step leads to formation of the formate complex [IrH2(η1-OC(O)H)(PhPNHP)] (7) [38]. The formate complex [IrH2(η 1-OC(O)H)(PhPNHP)] (7) further gets stabilized by the secondary sphere interactions between the oxygen atom of formate group HCOOIr and NH [5]. Evidence for this was obtained from 1H NMR spectroscopy of a signal for the N H moiety (δ 8.8 ppm). In the second step, reaction of the formate (7) complex with KOH results in the elimination of HCOOK with concomitant formation of a highly reactive amido dihydride complex [IrH2(PhPNP)] (5) (PNP = N(CH2CH2PPh2)2) and H2O. Subsequently, H2 adds across the IrN bond in the amido dihydride [IrH2(PNP)] complex (5) to regenerate the catalyst [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6), thus completing the catalytic cycle. The mechanism is supported by NMR spectral study of the catalytic cycle (S.M.). The plausible mechanism proposed here is closely related to the ones reported in the literature [39]."
17,Catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl and imine substrates,"3.5 Catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl and imine substrates In addition to catalytic hydrogenation of CO2, [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) complex acts as a catalyst for hydrogenation of polar organic substrates containing carbonyl and imine functionalities (Table 4). Reaction conditions were optimized using acetophenone as a model substrate (S.M.). A catalyst loading of 0.1 mol % was used. Acetophenone and its derivatives were hydrogenated completely at 50 °C with H2(g) (10 bar) in 5–9 h. In case of p-nitroacetophenone only 10% conversion to the corresponding alcohol product was noted under similar conditions. Benzaldehyde and 2-butanone, were quantitatively reduced to benzyl alcohol and 2-butanol, respectively in 6 h at 50 °C. Benzophenone and tetralone were reduced to the corresponding alcohol products, respectively in 75% conversion in 6 h at 50 °C. However, with increased reaction time (9 h, 60 °C), complete conversion was achieved. Moderate conversions were noted for the hydrogenation of N-benzylidene aniline and N-benzylidene benzylamine (49%) at much slower rates compared to carbonyl compounds under similar conditions. Styrene, 3-pentanone and methyl benzoate did not undergo hydrogenation under the reaction conditions (20 bar, 50 °C, 6 h) or even harsh conditions. The lack of hydrogenation of 3-pentanone compared to 2-butanone is attributed to its symmetrical nature and steric hindrance associated with it. To date, there have been very few reports for the hydrogenation of carbonyl and imine substrates using iridium metal complexes as catalysts [40]. Base-free hydrogenation reactions using H2(g) catalyzed by iridium hydride metal complexes are even more scarce. Compared to transfer hydrogenation, direct hydrogenation using H2(g) is considered to be a green route for industrial scale applications [41]. For example, Abdur-Rashid et al. reported direct hydrogenation (H2 = 10 bar) of carbonyl substrates in MeOH at room temperature using [IrH3(iPrPNHP)] complex [42]. The catalytic activity of [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) is comparable to that of [IrH3(iPrPNHP)] complex under the given conditions. The substituents on phosphorus of the RPNHP pincer ligand (R = iPr vs Ph) have no influence on the reduction of carbonyl and imine compounds. Additionally, complex 6 also hydrogenates imines N-benzylidene aniline and N-benzylidene benzylamine (entries 7 and 8, Table 4). Claver et al. reported catalytic hydrogenation of imines using diorthometalated iridium phosphite complex [IrH(COD)P(OC6H2-2,4-tBu2)2(OC6H2-2,4-tBu2)] at 30 bar H2(g) at 40 °C in MeOH with a substrate to precatalyst ratio of 100:1 [43]. Herrera and co-workers reported hydrogenation of imines at 200 psi pressure of H2(g) at 60 °C for 18 h with a S:C of 100:1 using [M(COD)(PPh3)2]PF6 {M = Ir, Rh} [44]. Our attempts to employ [RhH2Cl(PhPNHP)] (4) complex as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2, carbonyl and imine substrates were not successful. This could be attributed to the lack of formation of an active catalyst, [RhH3(PhPNHP)] complex under the reaction conditions. To elucidate the mechanism of the catalytic reaction, hydrogenation of acetophenone was investigated using NMR spectroscopy. Dissolution of [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) in MeOD-d 4 resulted in H−D exchange between MeO-D and IrH. Free H−D signal was noted at 4.60 ppm with J(H,D). = 43 Hz in the 1H NMR spectrum (S.M.). The reaction of [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) with excess PhCOCH3 was studied in toluene-d 8 (S.M.). Addition of PhCOCH3 to complex 6 resulted in the formation of a new set of hydride signals at −16.38 and −18.54 ppm with J(H,P cis ) = 16 Hz and J(H,H) = 5 Hz Hz, respectively in the 1H NMR spectrum. Additionally, the NH signal was noted at 5.10 ppm. A signal at 30.70 ppm was noted in the 31P NMR spectrum. Simultaneously, PhCOCH3 was converted into PhCH(OH)CH3 as noted by the appearance of signals in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. This clearly suggests an inner sphere mechanism where IrH attacks PhCOCH3 molecule to form Ir O C(H)R2 species. Introducing H2(g) (5 bar) into the sample regenerated the active hydrogenation catalyst, 6. Though there was no evidence for the existence of [IrH2(PhPNP)] (5) during the catalytic cycle, the formation of 6, PhCH(OH)CH3, and the disappearance of NH signal suggest its presence in the catalytic cycle. This is in contrast to the tentative mechanism proposed for the analogous [IrH3(iPrPNHP] complex where a bi-functional outer sphere mechanism was suggested [6]. Kirchner et al. reported inner sphere type mechanism for the base assisted hydrogenation of ketones catalyzed by [Fe(PNP-iPr)(H)(CO)Br] {PNP-iPr = 2,6-diaminopyrine based ligand} complex; support for this was found in the form of an attack of FeH onto the carbonyl moiety in the catalytic cycle [45]. The widely accepted bifunctional mechanism could be much more prevalent in ruthenium complexes containing HRuNH motif compared to iridium analogues [46]."
18,"Catalytic hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated ketones","3.6 Catalytic hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated ketones Surprisingly, hydrogenation of 2-cyclohexen-1-one at room temperature resulted in a mixture of cyclohexanol (18%) and 3-methoxycyclohexanol (82%) in MeOH (S.M.). The identity of the products was established by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS analysis. 3-Methoxycyclohexanol exists as both cis- and trans-diastereomers. Similarly, hydrogenation of 2-cyclohexen-1-one in ethanol resulted in the formation of 3-ethoxycyclohexanol (85%) along with the formation of cyclohexanol (15%). However, in case of hydrogenation of 2-cyclohexen-1-one in isopropanol resulted a mixture of 2-cyclohexen-1-ol (17%) and cyclohexanol (44%). On the other hand, hydrogenation of 2-cyclohexen-1-one in THF gave exclusively cyclohexanol. All reactions were carried out for 24–36 h at room temperature. The detailed reaction conditions optimization are given in S.M. These results are in sharp contrast to the chemoselective reduction of the carbonyl group in α, β-unsaturated compounds catalyzed by [IrH2Cl(iPrPNHP)]/KOtBu and [OsH2(CO)(κ3-PyCH2NHC2H4NHPtBu2)] complexes [47]. The formation of 3-methoxy/3-ethoxy cyclohexanol under the reaction conditions suggests tandem Michael addition-hydrogenation type reaction. In general, Michael addition reactions could be catalyzed by Lewis acid catalysts such as Cu(OTf)2, B(C6F5)3, AlCl3 etc. [48] We propose that the presence of phenyl groups on phosphorus could make the metal complex relatively acidic which results in the increased acidity of NH of the pincer ligand. Casado and co-workers utilized the acidity of NH in PhPNHP ligand in [Ir(COD)(PhPNHP)]Cl complex to protonate ‘OMe’ group in [Ir(μ-OMe)(COD)]2 [12]. We propose that complex 6 could behave as a Lewis acidic bifunctional catalyst which facilitates nucleophilic attack of MeOH at position 3 in 2-cyclohexen-1-one (Fig. 2 ). In the subsequent step, hydrogenation of Michael addition product 3-methoxycyclohexenone could lead to 3-methoxycyclohexanol. Lewis acid catalyzed Micheal-addition of α, β-unsaturated substrates were documented earlier [49]. Morris et al. studied tandem Michael addition-hydrogenation of 2-cyclohexen-1-one in benzene using trans-[RuH(η1-BH4)((S)-Ppro)2] {(S)-Ppro = (S)-2-(diphenylphosphinomethyl)pyrrolidine} as a catalyst and dimethylmalonate as a Michael donor. However, low yields were noted when the reaction was carried out EtOH or iPrOH [50]."
19,Conclusions,"A family of Ir and Rh complexes [M(COD)(PhPNHP)]Cl {M = Ir (1), Rh (2), PhPNHP = HN(CH2CH2PPh2)2}, [MH2Cl(PhPNHP)] {M = Ir (3), Rh (4)} and [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) were synthesized. All complexes were isolated in good yields and characterized by various analytical techniques. The [IrH3(PhPNHP)] (6) complex was found to be an active catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to HCOOK in 1M base (aq). Complex 6 was also found to be an active catalyst for the base-free hydrogenation of polar (carbonyl, 2-cylohexen-1-one, imines) substrates. Additionally, Lewis-acid-catalyzed tandem Michael addition-hydrogenation was achieved for 2-cyclohexen-1-one in ROH solvent (R = Me, Et) using complex 6."
