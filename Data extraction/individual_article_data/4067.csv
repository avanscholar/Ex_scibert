0,Introduction,"When biodiesel is produced the primary output other than biodiesel is glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol). For every 10kg of biodiesel, approximately 1kg of glycerol is also produced [1]. Currently, 266 million liters of glycerol is produced annually in the US and 14,896 million liters are produced worldwide [2]. With the advent of biodiesel industry, conversion of glycerol into high value chemicals emerged as a new branch of research [3]. In this aspect, conversion of glycerol to value added product is vital from both economical as well as environmental point of view [4–6]. Glyceric acid (GA) is one of the useful chemicals with medicinal [7–9] and industrial value [10,11] which can be obtained from glycerol oxidation. Glyceric acid (2,3-dihydoxypropionic acid) is naturally found as a phytochemical constituent in a variety of plants, such as peanuts, artichokes, tomatoes, apples, bananas, and grapes [12]. Chemoselective catalytical oxidation of glycerol over metallic catalysts such as platinum, palladium and gold has been shown to be a good technique for obtaining selective oxidative products from glycerol [13–15]. The synthesis of glyceric acid from pure glycerol has been reported by several research groups [16–18] using external oxidants. Although glycerol's unique structure makes it possible to conduct the heterogeneous catalytic oxidative reactions using oxidizing agents such as air, oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, the extensive functionalization of the glycerol molecule with hydroxyl groups of similar reactivity renders its selective conversion particularly difficult. Higher glycerol conversions with good selectivity are difficult due to over oxidation [19]. In presence of air (1bar), under mild conditions (60°C) Hutchings and coworkers [13] found that glycerol over oxidizes to CO2, HCHO and HCOOH however they optimized the conditions using pure oxygen to achieve 100% selectivity to glyceric acid. Prati and coworkers [20] found that bimetallic catalysts are superior to monometallic catalyst. They also showed that the selectivity toward glyceric acid can be improved by changing the reaction conditions. Besson and coworkers successfully performed liquid phase oxidation of glycerol to glyceric acid using Pt/C catalyst under air atmosphere [21]. Addition of boron to this catalyst improved the selectivity from 55% to 70%. Under these reaction conditions they found that this oxidation reaction is limited by the rate of diffusion of oxidants (oxygen) from the gas phase into liquid phase [21]. However, increasing the partial pressures creates additional problems. Catalysts based on the platinum group metal suffer oxygen poisoning proportional to oxygen partial pressure [22,23]. This study focuses to achieve high glyceric acid selectivity under mild photocatalytic conditions. TiSi2 is selected as the catalyst due to its potential for water splitting reactions under mild conditions [24]. Demuth and his team explored the possibility of titanium disilicide (TiSi2) for photocatalytic hydrogen generation by water splitting reaction [25]. TiSi2 has very unique optoelectronic properties that are ideal for use in solar applications: broad-band reflectance measurements show a band-gap range from 3.4eV to 1.5eV for TiSi2 [25]. As a result, this material absorbs light over a wide range of the solar spectrum (360–800nm), is easily available and inexpensive. In their work, they also proved TiSi2 has peculiar surface oxygen storage properties at lower temperatures up to 100°C. This paper describes a simple photocatalytical oxidation of aqueous glycerol to glyceric acid by exploiting TiSi2 oxygen storing properties ∼100°C when used as a photo catalyst [25]. Glycerol oxidation was carried out using the in situ generated oxygen from the photocatalytic activity of TiSi2 at 65°C under ambient conditions. A mechanism for selective glycerate production is proposed considering the physisorbed oxygen on the TiSi2 surface."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Glycerol (C3H8O3, ACS grade, Fluka, USA), titanium disilicide (TiSi2, 99.5% metal basis, Alfa Aesar, USA), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 86%, Sigma–Aldrich, USA), and hydrochloric acid (HCl, ACS reagent grade, Sigma–Aldrich, USA) were used as received. Crude glycerol was obtained from biodiesel production using spent coffee oil, feather meal fat as biodiesel feedstocks as reported in our earlier reported work [26,27]."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Commercially available TiSi2 was used as a photo catalyst. However, the crystallinity and formation of oxidative products such as TiO2 and SiO2 were tested using X-ray diffraction (XRD). All measurements were carried out by using powder diffraction apparatus (Philips automated XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54018Å). Data were acquired on a PC using MDI Data scan software and processed using MDI Jade and ICDD PDF minerals data base. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4700) was used to analyze the composition and distribution of catalyst material before and after the oxidation reaction. The images were taken at an accelerating voltage of 20kV. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was obtained using an Oxford detector."
4,Photocatalytic oxidation experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic oxidation experiments All photocatalytical oxidative experiments were done using a 300W solar simulator (69911, Newport-Oriel Instruments) as a light source. An optical AM 1.5 filter (Newport) was used to illuminate the 1 Sun intensity (100mW/cm2, measured by thermopile) on the catalyst at 65°C. The oxidation of glycerol was carried out in a 100mL round bottom (RB) flask containing 50mL, 1M KOH, and 10wt% solution of aqueous glycerol (5g) with 1wt% TiSi2 (500mg). The RB flask was kept 15cm from the light source. Catalytic testing was performed by dispersing TiSi2 powders in the above solution under atmospheric pressure."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The oxidation of glycerol was monitored using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu LCsolution-20-AB) with ultraviolet and refractive index detectors. Reactant and products were separated using an Aminex® HPX-87H ion exclusion column (300mm×7.8mm) heated at 40°C. The eluent used was a solution of H2SO4 (5×10−4 molL−1) at a flow rate of 0.75mL/min. Each time, the reaction mixture samples (10μL) were diluted to 1mL using the eluent solution and injected through HPLC. A calibration curve was generated using 10wt% to 2wt% solutions of glycerol. The terms ‘glycerol conversion’ and ‘glyceric acid normalized selectivity’ used here are defined as follows: glycerol conversion ( wt % ) = initial glycerol concentration − final glycerol concentration initial glycerol concentration × 100 glyceric acid selectivity = glyceric acid in products total products formed × 100 The glyceric acid formation was further confirmed by FTIR (Biorad). The FTIR measurement was performed as follows. First, the reaction mixture (after 12h) was neutralized with 12N hydrochloric acid and the reaction mixture was centrifuged. The excess water was removed by distillation. Second, the sample was cooled to ambient temperature and finally, the sample was compressed into self-supporting membrane with KBr to perform FTIR measurements. The selectivity as well as the purity of glyceric acid was confirmed using carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopy by analyzing the reaction mixture obtained after 12h. The spectrum was obtained on a Varian unity plus machine with 11.75T magnetic strength and operating at 125MHz (13C) in deuterated water (D2O). Samples of reaction mixture were neutralized with 12N hydrochloric acid and water was evaporated before adding D2O. The evolved gases were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilant 6890) with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The molecular sieve 5A column was used for the separation of gases and nitrogen was used as carrier gas. A flow rate of 30mL/min was used. The oven and detector temperatures were set as 50°C and 200°C, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,"A HPLC chromatogram of the reaction mixture for a reaction carried out at 65°C, 1M KOH, 10wt% glycerol (5g in 50mL) and 1wt% TiSi2 for 12h under air is shown in Fig. 1A and the results are summarized in Fig. 1B. As shown, glyceric acid was the only product observed with a glycerol conversion to glyceric acid to 97.6% with 100% glyceric acid selectivity. Glyceric acid formation was confirmed from 13C NMR. Position of each carbon (1–3) and their corresponding chemical shifts are given in Fig. 2 . The formation of glyceric acid further confirmed from FTIR analysis (Fig. 3 ). The most intense and characteristic bands observed for the reaction products were: 1068, 1296, 1554 and 1668cm−1 [28]. The CO stretching vibration was observed at 1068cm−1. Glyceric acid also showed an intense band at 1296cm−1 (CH bending) which corresponds to the coupling of the CH2 (CH) and CO groups. The glyceric acid also had a strong band at 1554cm−1, which corresponds to the carbonyl, CO, stretching (COO−) of the organic acid. The peak at 1668cm−1 is from the solvent (H2O). The effects of base and TiSi2 are explained later."
7,Alkaline oxidation of glycerol to glycerolate,"3.1 Alkaline oxidation of glycerol to glycerolate The crude glycerol obtained from biodiesel industry is at a pH of 11–14 due to dissolved KOH (catalyst for the transesterification reaction). Chemo-selective catalytic oxidation of glycerol experiments were reported favorable at a basic pH of 11[21]. Kishida et al. reported alkaline promoted deprotonation of glycerol to form glycerolate, which is a key factor in the initializing oxidation process (Eq. (1)) [29]. (1) Hutchings et al. [29] proposed that in the absence of base, initial dehydrogenation via H− abstraction is not possible. In presence of base, the H+ is readily abstracted from one of the primary hydroxyl groups of glycerol and overcomes the rate limiting step for the oxidation process [30]. Water splitting reactions using TiSi2 as catalyst under sunlight, and its reversible oxygen and hydrogen storage properties were explored thoroughly by Demuth and his research group [25]. They reported that small amounts of hydrogen (5–7mLg−1) physisorbed at 50°C when compared to 20mLg−1, at 30°C. However, the oxygen physisorbed on the TiSi2 surface remained intact well over 100°C [25]. This result suggests that oxygen can still remain adsorbed by TiSi2 in presence of light at working temperature (65°C) of this proposed work. At this working temperature, influence of the hydrogen on the oxidation process is neglected as for all practical purposes physisorbed hydrogen amounts on TiSi2 surface remain low. Thus, adsorbed oxygen (from water splitting) is proposed as an oxidative agent in the glycerol oxidation. The oxidation of hydrocarbons over metal oxides with reversible dioxygen storing capabilities was proven with Al2O3 and TiO2 [31]. Surface adsorbed oxygen is sufficient to cause the oxidation, and more specifically, oxidation of glycerolate ion. A schematic of the proposed reaction sequence of glycerolate ion is shown in Fig. 4 . The selective oxidation of glycerol to glyceric acid was attributed to: (i) The rate of oxidation of a primary alcohol function is higher than that of a secondary alcohol. (ii) Rapid oxidation of glyceraldehyde favors the formation of surface adsorbed glyceric acid. (iii) A basic pH increases desorption of the acid (as potassium salt) from TiSi2 surface."
8,Water splitting properties of TiSi2 catalyst,"3.2 Water splitting properties of TiSi2 catalyst When no glycerin and no sodium hydroxide (Eq. (2)) were used the production of hydrogen was reported to be 35mL/24h/2000mg [25]. (2) TiSi2 +6H2O→TiSi2 oxides+6H2 The reported procedure was a solar light dependent reaction. In the absence of light the reaction produced a little hydrogen gas (Fig. 5a). The mechanism for the hydrogen production is: (3) H2O→½ O2 +2H+ +2e− (4) 2H+ +2e− →H2 Oxidation of water is the key step for the faster production rates (Eq. (3)). Addition of 1M KOH helped enhancing the production rate. A higher production rate (10.2mL/h/50mg) was observed when 1M KOH solution (Eq. (5)) was used instead of water. A basic pH increases the oxidation rate of water to oxygen because the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group much easier at higher pHs (Eq. (3)) [32]. (5) 2TiSi2 +10H2O+2KOH→2KTiSi2O6 +11H2 However, Ritterskamp et al. [25] reported that, in the hydrogen generation process, the first step is the oxidation of water to oxygen and H+ ions at the catalytical center (Eq. (2)). But TiSi2 is also a good storage material for thus produced oxygen which adsorbs on the surface of the catalyst material [25]. This might hinder the second step of the process (Eq. (3)) which will be occurred on the surface of the same material (TiSi2). So, removal of the oxygen generated from first step will further enhance the water splitting reaction. Garcia et al. reported that the oxidation of glycerin to glyceric acid reaction limited by the rate of diffusion of oxygen from the gas phase into liquid phase [21]. When a 5wt% glycerin was used in with the reaction mixture the production of hydrogen increased to 29.4mL/h/50mg per hour (Eq. (6)). (6) 2TiSi2 +12H2O+2KOH+2C3H8O3 →2KTiSi2O6 +15H2 +2C3H6O4 This higher production rates attributed to the removal of adsorbed oxygen from surface due to oxidation of glycerin to glyceric acid and making the catalytical sites available for the water oxidation reaction. Contrastingly, the oxygen storage property of titanium disilicide further increases the probability of the glycerol oxidation process at the surface. Thus glycerin oxidation process fastened the water splitting process."
9,Catalyst stability,"3.3 Catalyst stability TiSi2 semiconductors are inexpensive and abundant. However, poor stability toward basic water is one disadvantage. Demuth and co-workers reported that the water splitting reaction is not stoichiometric when compared with TiSi2, indicating the catalytical nature of the material [25]. However, formation of the passive layers of oxygen impedes the reaction rates. Removal of the adsorbed oxygen using glycerol showed enhancement in the water splitting reaction as shown in Fig. 5 . The production of hydrogen is enhanced in the presence of glycerol. All experiments were conducted in ambient conditions, thus, the presence of an oxygen peak is predictable. However, no enhancement of the oxygen peak was observed indicating the oxygen capturing capability of TiSi2 under working conditions. The presence of glycerol helps scavenge the surface oxygen molecules and promotes the water splitting reaction. The reaction after 6h showed only 64.3% glycerol conversion (supporting information) but catalyst was still capable of generating hydrogen. Longer reaction times (12h) showed 97.6% conversion but the catalyst was not reusable. Fig. 5 shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of (a) TiSi2 as obtained and (b) after the photo catalytic reaction over 12h. Though there is no considerable change in the particle size, Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (insert table, Fig. 6 ) showed the formation of some oxides. Excess oxygen due to the adsorption of KOH or glycerol or glyceric acid is ruled out as the samples were washed and centrifuged several times before the EDX analysis. Formation of crystalline SiO2 or TiO2 is also ruled out since the XRD pattern of the sample does not resemble any of those materials (Fig. 7 ). The disappearance of TiSi2 peaks in the used catalyst may be attributed to the poisoning of the catalyst material in basic medium. The new peaks were not able to match to the XRD library, which needs further investigation. Further, heat treatment of the catalyst sample before XRD measurement was not carried out to retain the chemical structure of as obtained catalyst after the reaction. However by combing the EDX analysis results and Eq. (6) it can be concluded that the TiSi2 structure converted to pyroxene [33] structured KTiSi2O6 complex. Prolonged oxidation in water formed amorphous material from TiSi2. However, the need to maintain an optimum concentration of glycerol in the reaction mixture to hinder the catalyst degradation should be explored further."
10,Crude glycerol and purified glycerol,"3.4 Crude glycerol and purified glycerol Crude glycerol was obtained from biodiesel production using spent coffee oil and feathermeal fat as biodiesel feedstocks as reported in our earlier reported work [26,27]. The crude glycerol contained excess methanol, KOH (∼2M) and other impurities. Centrifugation separates any solid soap like impurities. However, methanol interference with glyceric acid is ruled out because esterification of acid in presence of base and water cannot proceed efficiently. A maximum glycerol conversion of 96.1% with 100% glyceric acid selectivity was obtained after 12h of reaction. The results revealed the catalyst is active for even crude glycerol oxidation as well. Further optimization studies are in progress to investigate the correlation between the catalyst properties and selectivity over glyceric acid."
11,Conclusion,"This study shows that TiSi2 can be conveniently employed to selectively oxidize glycerol to glyceric acid using solar light, under mild conditions. 97.6% conversion with 100% selectivity to glyceric acid was obtained after 12h of reaction at 65°C. The presence of glycerol in aqueous solution helped TiSi2 in its water splitting reaction and in the formation of glyceric acid. Under these reaction conditions, hydrogen and oxygen are also obtained as value products. However, replacing the batch reaction with the continuous (flow of glycerol) reaction and its effect on preventing the deterioration of the catalyst (TiSi2) is still needed to be explored. The effects of reaction parameters, particle size of TiSi2 on product selectivity will also be the subject of further study."
