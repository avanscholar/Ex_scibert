0,Introduction,"The reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions of small aromatic molecules have attracted a great deal of interest in recent years due to their potential application in the development of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs). The idea behind the LOHC is that the hydrogen is stored in a molecule that contains double bonds via a catalytic reaction. The hydrogen accumulated in this way can be released at any time and at any location via a catalytic dehydrogenation reaction. In this context, chemical hydrogen storage and transport systems are of great interest. These should make it possible to store significant amounts of hydrogen and to release pure hydrogen on demand. However, finding affordable but efficient hydrogen storage systems remains a challenge for the upcoming hydrogen economy. In our recent studies [1,2], we have shown that alkyl-substituted pyrazines can be considered as a seminal LOHCs, provided that efficient, large-scale synthesis of these compounds is developed. The methods of making pyrazine derivatives are limited. In industry, substituted pyrazines are synthesized by the catalytic condensation of ethylenediamine with vicinal diols such as propylene glycol [3]. A very simple and environmentally friendly method for the preparation of substituted pyrazines has been reported just recently [4]. A highly selective formation of 2,5-alkyl-substituted pyrazines was achieved by base-metal catalysed dehydrogenative self-coupling of 2-amino-alcohols. There are two crucial advantages of the latter method. The first one is that the replacement of noble-metal-based catalysts by catalysts based on low-toxicity, earth-abundant base metals is a significant for development of the cost-effective homogeneous catalysis. The second advantage is that there are a number of effective synthetic methods of 2-amino-alcohols synthesis from cheap and readily available starting materials that opens up a promising route towards sustainable production of amino-alcohols from renewable sources. For example, an efficient and environmentally benign method of coupling reaction of amino acids with aldehydes or ketones to synthesise various amino-alcohols at room temperature has been described [5]. Taking into account both advantages of alkyl-pyrazine synthesis from amino-alcohols, such a protocol can be considered as very suitable for the further development of large-scale commercial processes. Another area of application also motivated this study. Amino-alcohols are easily complexed with various transition metals. Such complexes are widely used in different fields: as catalysis, inhibitors, in electroplating, and in the dye industry [6]. Moreover, these features are successfully used to obtain a wide range of volatile organometallic compounds that are used as precursors in chemical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition technologies to provide inorganic materials of various types and compositions [7,8]. From this point of view, amino alcohols can be used both as independent ligands [9] and, what has proven to be more valuable, as additional co-ligands [7,8]. Since the numerous settings can be varied (type, number and position of the substituents in the carbon skeleton and length of the carbon chain), these ligands give related complexes additional possibilities for controlling thermal stability and volatility. Admittedly, knowledge of reliable thermodynamic data in general is essential for the design and development of new compounds and technologies. In this paper we studied the series of amino-alcohols shown in Fig. 1 . The focus of this work was on vapour pressures measurements and the standard molar vaporization enthalpies, Δ l g H m o (298.15 K). We used different empirical and structure–property correlations for validation and evaluation of new experimental results. Moreover, in order to fulfil the expectation that thermodynamic data on amino-alcohols can be useful for optimization of alkyl-pyrazines (as seminal liquid organic hydrogen carriers) synthesis, we used new data in combination with our previous thermochemical data on alkyl-pyrazines to calculate the energetics of dehydrogenative self-coupling of 2-amino-alcohols."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All samples of amino-alcohols were of commercial origin (see Table S1) with purities of 0.94 to 0.99 mass fraction. Samples of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-amino-2-butanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, and 5-amino-1-pentanol for the transpiration measurements were purified by repeated distillation at reduced pressures. Samples for GC experiments were used as received. Purities were determined using a gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-5 capillary column and a flame ionization detector."
3,Experimental thermochemical methods,"2.2 Experimental thermochemical methods Vapour pressures of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-amino-2-butanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, and 5-amino-1-pentanol at different temperatures were measured by using the transpiration method with the self-made set up [10,11]. Vapor pressures derived from the transpiration method are reliable within (1 to 3) % [10,11]. The standard molar enthalpies of vaporization, Δ l g H m o , were derived from the temperature dependence of vapour pressure. The error in the enthalpies of vaporization is assumed to be within ±(0.3 to 0.5) kJ·mol−1 [10,11]. For more details on the experimental procedure, see the Supporting Information. Kovats’s retention indices of a series of amino-alcohols (2-amino-1-propanol, 2-amino-1-butanol, 2-amino-1-pentanol, 2-amino-1-hexanol, 1-amino-2-propanol, and 1-amino-2-butanol) were determined using a GC equipped with a FID. A DB-1 capillary column was used with a column length of 100 m, an inside diameter of 0.2 mm, and a film thickness of 0.5 μm. The temperature of the injector was 473 K, the temperature of the detector was 423 K, the carrier gas was helium, the split ratio was 1/100, the sample volume was 0.2 μL. The study was performed in the temperature range 363–393 K. For more details on the experimental procedures, see the Supporting Information."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Absolute vapour pressures and thermodynamics of vaporization,"3.1 Absolute vapour pressures and thermodynamics of vaporization Experimental absolute vapour pressures, pi, and their temperature dependence was measured by transpiration. Vapor pressure results for the amino-alcohols were fit to the following equation [10]: R × ln ( p i / p r e f ) = a + b T + Δ l g C p , m o × l n T T 0 where R = 8.31446 J.K−1.mol−1 is the molar gas constant, the reference pressure, p r e f = 1 Pa, and a and b are adjustable parameters; the arbitrary temperature T 0 applied in Eq. (1) was chosen to be T 0 = 298.15 K and Δ l g C p , m o is the difference of the molar heat capacities of the gas and the liquid phases respectively. The Δ l g C p , m o –values are required for fitting Eq. (1) and also for the temperature adjustment of vaporization enthalpy according to Kirchhoff’s rule. There are at least four well-established methods that can be used for the assessment of Δ l g C p , m o values, which are described in detail in our recent studies [12,13]. The simplest and straightforward method was developed by Chickos and Acree [14] and it was used in this paper. They suggested an empirical way to assess Δ l g C p , m o –values by equation: (2) - Δ l g C p , m o 298.15 K = 0.26 × C p , m o l iq , 298.15 + 10.58 where C p , m o (liq, 298.15 K)-data are of experimental origin or can be also estimated according to group-additivity [15]. The coefficients of Eq. (2) were derived from experimental data available for different classes of organic compounds and the Δ l g C p , m o – estimates according to Eq. (2) are claimed to be accurate within ± 16 J.K−1.mol−1 [16]. The compilation of available experimental standard molar heat capacities, C p,m o , for amino-alcohols, as well as the Δ l g C p,m o -differences estimated by Eq. (2) are given in Table S2. The primary experimental results on vapour pressures for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-amino-2-propanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, and 5-amino-1-pentanol using transpiration are summarized in Table 1 . The vapour pressures for 1-amino-2-butanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, and 5-amino-1-pentanol were measured for the first time. Vapour pressures measurements on 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol have been a popular endeavor in the past [19–23]. As can be seen from Fig. 2 , the vapour pressures available for the 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, measured by ebulliometry and the static method are remarkably consistent. The main motivation for carrying out the new measurements was to investigate possible peculiarities of amino-alcohols under the conditions of the transpiration experiments. Our new transpiration results are in agreement with the static results reported by Belabbaci et al. [22] in the comparable temperature range (see Fig. 2). No irregularities were observed which gives confidence in using the transpiration method for this class of compound. The complete lack of data for 1-amino-2-butanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, and 5-amino-1-pentanol prompted us to use experimental boiling temperatures at different pressures compiled by SciFinder [24]. The accuracy of this data is questionable as it comes from the distillation of a compound after its synthesis and not from special physico-chemical studies. However, numerous data on boiling temperatures at standard pressure, as well as at reduced pressures provide a reliable level of experimental vapour pressures and trend of the dependence of vapour pressure with temperature. For example, in Fig. 2 for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, the boiling points at different pressures compiled by SciFinder are in fair agreement with the precise ebulliometric and static measurements. In this work for the sake of comparison, we have systematically collected the data available in SciFinder for amino-alcohols in Fig. 1. The comparisons of our new results with those of SciFiner are shown in Figs. S1-S4 (supporting information). To our surprise, the agreement observed for 2-amino-1-butanol (Fig. S2), 3-amino-1-propanol (Fig. S3), 4-amino-1-butanol (Fig. S4), and 5-amino-1-pentanol (Fig. S5) can be considered sufficient to obtain the reliable trend of the temperature dependencies of the vapour pressures. The SciFinder data involved in data acquisition are summarized in Table S3. Vapour pressures for 1-amino-2-propanol are available from the static method [19] and from the compilation by Stephenson and Malanowski [25]. The significant disagreement is shown in Fig. S6. Unfortunately, the compilation by Stephenson and Malanowski [25] provides only the Antoine constants. Information on the method and purity of the compound is missing and the reason for the disagreement observed for 1-amino-2-propanol cannot be explained. Experimental vapour pressures measured in this work (as well as those from the literature) have been used to obtain the enthalpies of vaporization of amino-alcohols using the following equation [10,11]: (3) Δ l g H m o T = - b + Δ l g C p , m o × T Experimental vapour pressure temperature dependences were also used to derive the vaporization entropies at temperatures T by using the following equation [10,11]: (4) Δ l g S m o T = Δ l g H m o / T + R × l n p i / p o with p o = 0.1 MPa. Coefficients a and b of Eq. 1, Δ l g H m o (T) and Δ l g S m o (T) values are reported in Table 1. The combined uncertainties of the vaporization enthalpies include uncertainties from the experimental conditions of transpiration, uncertainties in vapour pressure and uncertainties due to the temperature adjustment to T = 298.15 K as described elsewhere [17,18]. The compilation of the standard molar enthalpies of vaporization of amino-alcohols at the reference temperature T = 298.15 K, calculated according to Eq. (3)) is given in Table 2 . As can be seen from Table 2, the vaporization enthalpies, Δ l g H m o (298.15 K), derived from vapour pressures measured by the conventional methods as well as those derived from the SciFinder data are in good agreement for 2-amino-1-butanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-amino-2-butanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, and 5-amino-1-pentanol. Such a good agreement has reinforced valuability of the experimental boiling temperatures compiled by the SciFinder for the evaluation of the scarce thermodynamic data. Nevertheless, the additional validation of vaporization enthalpies, Δ l g H m o (298.15 K), which were derived for amino-alcohols in Table 2, is necessary."
6,Kovats’s retention indices for validation of experimental vaporization enthalpies,"3.2 Kovats’s retention indices for validation of experimental vaporization enthalpies Correlation Gas-Chromatographic (CGC) method is often used to validate the experimental enthalpies of vaporization [29]. This method is based on correlating the experimental Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values with their Kovats’s indices [30]. The n-alkanes are used as standards for the calculating the Kovats’s retention index, Jx , as follows [30]: (5) J x = lg t x - l g ( t N ) lg t N + 1 - l g ( t N ) × 100 + 100 N where x refers to the adjusted retention time tx of compound under determination; N is the number of carbon atoms of the n-alkane eluting before, and (N + 1) is the number of carbon atoms of the n-alkane eluting after the peak of interest. According to the established GC procedure, all retention times are corrected for the “dead” retention time. In this work we measured Kovats’s indices for amino-alcohols in the temperature range from 363 K to 393 K with the capillary column DB-1 (see Table S4). In addition, some literature data available on the retention indices for amino-alcohols on DB-1 [31] were taken for correlation with the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values evaluated in this work (see Table 2). The results of this correlation are given in the Table 3 . It is known, that the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values correlate linearly with Kovats’s indices in various homologous series of alkanes, alkylbenzenes, aliphatic ethers, alcohols, or in a series of structurally similar compounds [29]. As anticipated, the following linear correlation was obtained when the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values are correlated with Jx-values for the structurally parent set of amino-alcohols collected in Table 3: (6) Δ l g H m o ( 298.15 K ) / ( k J ∙ m o l - 1 ) 28.5 + 0.0443 × J x w i t h ( R 2 = 0.992 ) The vaporization enthalpies derived from the correlations with Kovats’s indices (see Tables 3, column 5) are in a good agreement with those obtained by the transpiration method (see Table 2). Such good agreement can be seen as additional validation of the experimental data measured in this work by using the transpiration method (see Table 2). It can be seen from Table 3, that differences between experimental vaporization enthalpies and values calculated according to Eq. (6) are mostly below 1 kJ·mol−1. Hence, the uncertainties of enthalpies of vaporization which are estimated from the correlation of Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) with Kovats’s indices are evaluated with an uncertainty of ± 1.0 kJ·mol−1, which also included the uncertainties of the Kovats’s indices measurements (see Table S4)."
7,Chain-length dependence for validation of experimental vaporization enthalpies,"3.3 Chain-length dependence for validation of experimental vaporization enthalpies Admittedly, the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values correlate linearly with the number of C-atoms within the homologues series of organic compounds [29]. For example, n-alkanes with the chain-length N C = 2 to 11 exhibit the following linear dependency (in kJ·mol−1): (7) Δ l g H m o 298.15 K = 1.03 + 5.06 × N c ( w i t h R 2 = 0.9982 ) Also n-alkanols with the chain-length N C = 2 to 11 obey the following linear dependency (in kJ·mol−1): (8) Δ l g H m o ( 298.15 K ) = 33.2 + 4.74 × N c ( w i t h R 2 = 0.9983 ) Another example, n-alkylamines with the chain-length N C = 2 to 11 show their own linear dependence (in kJ·mol−1): (9) Δ l g H m o 298.15 K = 16.5 + 4.82 × N c w i t h R 2 = 0.9993 The data included in these correlations are summarized in Table S5. It is evident from Eqs. (7–9) that the (CH2)-contribution to the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-value in n-alkanes (5.06 kJ·mol−1) is slightly larger compared to those in n-alkanols (4.78 kJ·mol−1) or in n-alkylamines (4.82 kJ·mol−1). Are amino-alcohols something special in regard to the chain-length dependence? The Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-data evaluated on 2-amino-1-alkanols are collected in Table 4 . The chain-length dependence developed for this series is given by the following equation (in kJ·mol−1): (10) Δ l g H m o 298.15 K = 44.8 + 4.75 × N c ( w i t h R 2 = 0.9997 ) It is quite obvious that the (CH2)-contributions to the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) derived for n-alkanols, n-alkyl-amines, and 2-amino-1-alkanols are hardly distinguishable. This observation can serve as a valuable indicator of internal consistency of our new experimental results. Moreover, the (CH2)-contribution of 4.8 kJ·mol−1 can be also propagated to the series of 1-amino-2-alkanols, where the reliable experimental Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values are known only for 1-amino-2-propanol and 1-amino-2-butanol (see Table 2). In order to assess the vaporization enthalpies of 1-amino-2-alkanols with the chain-length NC = 5 to 8, the contribution (CH2) = 4.8 kJ·mol−1 was subsequently added starting from the experimental value Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) = 63.7 ± 0.4 kJ·mol−1 of 1-amino-2-butanol (see Table 2). The Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values for 1-amino-2-alkanols calculated in this additive manner are given in Tables 2 and S6 and designated as “GA” (or calculated by Group-Additivity) Contrary to our expectations, the very good ( Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) - N C) correlation was also obtained for the series of the following n-alkanol-amines (3-amino-1-propanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, 5-amino-1-pentanol, and 6-amino-1-hexanol): (11) Δ l g H m o ( 298.15 K ) = 48.8 + 4.74 × N c ( w i t h R 2 = 0.9849 ) The experimental data used for correlation are compiled in Table S6. The presence of strong intra-molecular hydrogen bonding in 3-amino-1-propanol, and the absence of such a feature in 4-amino-1-butanol, 5-amino-1-pentanol, and 6-amino-1-hexanol are known [32]. To our surprise however, the vaporization enthalpy of 3-amino-1-propanol correlates perfectly with the species with the longer chain between amino and hydroxyl groups. Perhaps this observation might be explained by the significant prevalence of the inter-molecularly bound species compared to the intramolecularly bound species in the liquid aminoalcohols."
8,Evaluation of available vaporization enthalpies,"3.4 Evaluation of available vaporization enthalpies Information on vaporization enthalpies for eighteen amino-alcohols has been collected in Table 2. Unfortunately, most of these compounds are not commercially available in sufficient quantities for vapour pressure measurements using conventional techniques (ebulliometry, statics, transpiration, etc.). In order to obtain information about vaporization thermodynamics of a possibly broad scope of amino-alcohols structures, we applied the empirical method ( Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) - N C correlation), structure–property relationships ( Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) - N C correlations), as well as the GA procedure (development of the suitable CH2-contribution). The experimental and “theoretical” vaporization enthalpies derived for each amino-alcohol are given in Table 2. From this table can be seen, that for every compound, agreement among Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values, which were derived in different ways, all lie within the assigned error bars. To get more confidence and reliability, we calculated the weighted average (the uncertainty was used as a weighing factor) for most of the aminoalcohols given in Table 2. These values are highlighted in bold and are recommended for thermochemical calculations."
9,Energetics of dehydrogenative coupling reactions of amino-alcohols leading to alkyl-pyrazines,"3.5 Energetics of dehydrogenative coupling reactions of amino-alcohols leading to alkyl-pyrazines The promising environmentally friendly dehydrogenative coupling of 2-amino-alcohols to form 2,5-disubstituted symmetrical pyrazines homogeneously catalyzed by a Mn-pincer complex was reported by Daw et al. [4]. The typical reactions R1 to R3 are given in Fig. 3 . A particular attraction of these reactions is that two molecules of amino-alcohols will release three molecules of H2 and only water if 2,5-di-alkyl-substituted pyrazines are obtained. The synthesis is carried out at 423 K with a conversion of 99% and an isolated yield of up to 95%. The enthalpies of reactions, Δ r H m o (liq, 298.15 K), were calculated according to Hess’s Law with the help of standard molar enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (liq, 298.15 K), of the participants of reactions R1-R3 The gas phase enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K), of numerous amino-alcohols were recently estimated using the high-level quantum-chemical composite G4 method [33]. These values for 2-amino-1-propanol, 2-amino-1-butanol, and 2-amino-1-pentanol (see Table S7), have been combined with the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values for these amino-alcohols evaluated in this work (see Table 2). The resulting liquid phase enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (liq, 298.15 K), are given in Table 5 , column 2. The Δ f H m o (liq, 298.15 K)-values for alkyl-pyrazines were evaluated in our recent works [1,2] and they are given in Table 5, column 3. The resulting reactions R1-R3 enthalpies, Δ r H m o (298.15 K), calculated using Hess’s Law are given in Table 5, column 4. Surprisingly, it has turned out that the dehydrogenative coupling reactions of amino-alcohols are strongly endothermic with the reaction enthalpies at the level of 100 kJ·mol−1. This aspect must be taken into account when optimizing the synthetic conditions. The energetic effects of all three reactions are not very different, but the slight dependence on the chain length does not seem to be important within the experimental error bars. In our recent work [1,2], we have shown that pyrazine and alkyl substitute pyrazines can be considered as prospective candidates for LOHC. The energetics of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of pyrazine derivatives is significantly smaller compared to other seminal LOHC candidates. For example, for 2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine, the reaction enthalpy per mole of hydrogen Δ r H m o = -54.6 kJ·mol−1/H2 (see Table 6 ) is considerably smaller than those for commercially available biphenyl with Δ r H m o = -64.6 kJ·mol−1/H2 [35] or commercial thermofluids based on benzyltoluenes (Marlothem LH®) and dibenzyltoluenes (Marlotherm SH®) (–63.5 and –65.4 kJ·mol−1/H2, respectively) [36]. Moreover, the reaction enthalpy for 2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine is comparable with enthalpy of hydrogenation of N-ethyl-carbazole (–50.5 kJ·mol−1/H2) [37–39]. It has also been found that a consequent methylation of the pyrazine ring (methyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, and tetramethyl) decreases the liquid phase reaction enthalpy per mole of hydrogen even more significantly (from −59.7 kJ·mol−1 observed for unsubstituted pyrazine to −48.5 kJ·mol−1 for tetra-methyl-pyrazine, Table 6) [1,2]."
