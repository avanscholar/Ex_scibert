0,Introduction,"The increasing global population and growing industrializations are critical issues for the energy shortage and environmental problems [1–4]. There is a dire need to reconnoiter sustainable and renewable energy systems that can fulfill future energy demands [5–9]. Photocatalysis is the chemical process that can use for various applications like water splitting, pollutant degradation [10,11], water purification [12] and CO2 reduction etc. Photocatalytic water splitting by utilizing solar energy is an optimal approach to produce hydrogen energy [13–18]. The selection of suitable semiconductor photocatalyst has been a great challenge for every researcher. Among various semiconductors, TiO2 has widely studied due to its multifunctional physical and chemical properties, non-toxicity, strong oxidation ability, low-cost and good light stability [19,20]. However, the large bandgap of rutile and anatase about 3.0 eV and 3.2 eV respectively can only absorb the ultraviolet light that contains 5% of the total solar spectrum [21]. In recent years, a new metal-free photocatalyst graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a promising material due to its narrow bandgap of 2.7 eV, visible light absorbance, high electrical and chemical stability [22–27]. Though, the fast recombination rate and low surface area limit the photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, many modification techniques such as metal and non-metal doping [28–39], morphological alteration, Nano-structuring, and heterojunction with other semiconductors [40–42] have been adopted to overcome the problems of these photocatalysts. To get benefit from the band level of both semiconductors, the heterojunctions between TiO2 and g-C3N4 proved to be useful in enhancing the surface area and transfer of electrons and holes [43,44]. Zhong et al. reported g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure by calcination method improved the hydrogen performance by two times [45]. Similarly, Li et al. prepared g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure by using the solvothermal method [46]. However, the phase of g-C3N4 in most of the composite is bulk and micron in sizes. It employed that the photocatalytic efficiency could increase if nanosized g-C3N4 multifarious used. Several studies have been considered the nanoparticles of the g-C3N4 composite with TiO2. Su et al. loaded nanoparticles of g-C3N4 on TiO2 nanotubes and improved the photocatalytic efficiency [47]. Besides that, the study related to quantum dots (QDs) or nanoparticles of g-C3N4/TiO2 has rarely investigated. Infect, quantum dots (QDs) are getting enormous significance in the field of photocatalysis due to its exclusive structural, optical, and electrical properties [48–54]. In the last few years, the number of different metals, cocatalyst, and metal-free materials has been integrated with QDs to carry out high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by using visible light source [55–60]. The greater surface area to volume ratio of QDs, the absorption of photons, and fast transfer of charge carriers are the main attribution of QDs to enhance the photocatalytic performance [10,55–60]. Moreover, the smaller size of QDs also reduces the recombination rate by creating a bridge for charge carriers and increase the photocatalytic performance [61,62]. The most exciting thing about QDs that it provides the shortest distance to electron/hole to move from crystal interface to surface which automatically enhances the movement of electron/holes for the contribution during the reaction. When QDs coated on any surface, it generates the new traps that help to increase the light-induced response and ultimately enhance the photocatalytic performance. However, g-C3N4 QDs as an attractive candidate to convert the UV light to visible light due to its exceptional optical properties. It has an advantage of high stability, non-toxic, biocompatible and facile synthesis [63–65]. So, it appeals the attention and utilized in various applications like solar cells [66], sensing and imaging [67], security ink [68], heavy metal detection, energy and environment. The g-C3N4 QDs helps to transfer the charge carriers more easily after absorbing more light [64]. Lin et al., prepared the g-C3N4 QDs to remove the pollutants and it shows high photocatalytic performance under visible light [69]. The g-C3N4 QDs have low surface energy due to reactive functional groups that can easily be loaded on another surface material. Here in this paper, we first time report the loading of g-C3N4 QDs on the hierarchically branched TiO2 (HBTiO2) nanofibers by a simple vapor deposition method. Li. et al. coated the single-crystal TiO2 nanotube array for the degradation of pollutants and hydrogen production by photo electrocatalysis [18]. An et al. used TiO2 nanowires to explore the photoelectrochemical application of CN QDs [70]. The noble metals especially Au deposition on the surface of semiconductors has gained much attention due to its localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect from the oscillation of the electron present at the surface that can help to actively absorb the visible light by widening the light absorption range of semiconductor [71]. It also has a unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties that make it chemically stable and durable. The loading of Au can act as electron traps to facilitate the charge separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and promote the interfacial charge transfer process. Moreover, plasmonic excitation of Au-NP’s results in the generation of additional electrical surface charges. Therefore, the deposition of Au nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 could prove to be useful to encompass its spectral response. However, to best of our knowledge, the study regarding loading of plasmonic Au on the surface of branched TiO2 nanofibers and fabricate its composite with g-C3N4 QDs for the hydrogen production under visible light yet need to be investigated. On the other hand, the morphological tuning of the material especially one-dimensional structure plays a significant role in the photocatalyst of water splitting due to their high thermal, optical, electrical and magnetic properties [72–76]. The 1D nanostructure of TiO2 offers a smooth artery for the fast electrons transfer. However, in some cases related to photocatalyst, the performance of 1D structures is not satisfactorily due to the low surface area resulted from unifying structure and large trivial spaces between contiguous single 1D unit [77,78]. Therefore, researchers employed a hierarchically branched one-dimensional design structures that mainly obtained by adorning the 1D stems with tributaries [79,80]. The delicate structures proclaimed to examine an outstanding performance in the different fields of research as compared to bare 1D structure [81]. The variety of methods have been developed to produce the hierarchical branched (HB) on the surface of TiO2 that proved an extraordinary performance in various fields [82–89]. However, the reported methods to synthesis the composite of g-C3N4/TiO2 have complex enough and need more than two steps to get the required results. Recently, our group fabricated 1D branched TiO2 nanofibers that show significant performance as photocatalysis and high efficiency in lithium-ion batteries [90]. Wang et al. also prepared branched TiO2 using the hydrothermal treatment that displays an efficient improvement in specific surface area and reversible specific capacity [86]. Li et al. fabricated TiO2 with the surface of the SiO2 structure and got better performance for the degradation of pollutants [91]. The noble metals especially Au deposition on the surface of semiconductors has gained much attention due to its localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect from the oscillation of the electron present at the surface that can help to actively absorb the visible light by widening the light absorption range of semiconductor [71]. It also has a unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties that make it chemically stable and durable. The loading of Au can act as electron traps to facilitate the charge separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and promote the interfacial charge transfer process. Moreover, plasmonic excitation of Au-NP’s results in the generation of additional electrical surface charges. Therefore, the deposition of Au nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 could prove to be useful to encompass its spectral response. Therefore, in this study, we have prepared a hairy structure on the 1D TiO2 fiber so that the surface area of the fiber could increase. It has been observed that the delicate branched structure has improved the performance as compared to the bare structure especially by absorbing more light. The branched structure help to absorb more light by increasing the light travelling path due to the reflecting and scattering within branched structure. The incident light scattering and reflecting effect increases due to the hierarchical structure and light can reach those places where it cannot directly reach. Secondly, we adopted CVD method to load g-C3N4 QDs on the 1D fiber due to sublimation process of melamine in which we have seen that QDs uniformly distributed over the fiber and there is no self-aggregation of QDs. This technique makes QDs stable and effective for the separation of charge carriers. However, to best of our knowledge, the study regarding loading of plasmonic Au on the surface of branched TiO2 nanofibers and fabricate its composite with g-C3N4 QDs for the hydrogen production under visible light yet need to be investigated. In this work, we reported a new type of composite with branched TiO2, g-C3N4 QDs and Au NPs by adopting vapor and photo deposition methods that proved to be a good heterostructure photocatalyst. It revealed the highest photocatalytic performance in the visible light irradiation (λ = 420 nm) by generating hydrogen about 2.22 mmol g−1 h−1 with a quantum efficiency of 19.5%. The high performance is mainly due to the type II heterostructures that successfully separate the photogenerated charge carriers and the SPR effect of Au helped to widen the absorption band. The 1D branched structure of TiO2 also encourages the fast movement of the electron by absorbing more light and hence the performance has increased."

2,Fabrication of electrospun nanofibrous TiO2,"2.1 Fabrication of electrospun nanofibrous TiO2 Firstly, 20 ml of ethyl alcohol and glacial acetic acid (weight ratio 4:1) with 1.5 ml of tetrabutyl titanate (TBT, 98%) mixed in a 25 ml Erlenmeyer flask then 2.0 g of Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP: Mw = 1300000) was dissolved in it and stirring was done at room temperature for 12 h to form a clear solution. Afterward, 10 ml of this solution injected into the syringe having a steel needle connected with a high voltage of 12 kV. The distance of 12 cm placed between the needle and the aluminum foil collector. Finally, the as-spun nanofibers were calcined at 500 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1 in muffle furnace to get original TiO2 nanofibers."
3,Preparation of hierarchically branched TiO2 nanofibers (HBTiO2),"2.2 Preparation of hierarchically branched TiO2 nanofibers (HBTiO2) The branched TiO2 fiber obtained by using alkali hydrothermal treatment. Typically, 0.5 g of as-prepared original TiO2 fiber and 50 ml of NaOH (10 mol. L-1 aq.) solution was mixed uniformly in a Teflon lined autoclave and heated for 3 h at 120 °C. after the hydrothermal treatment, the final product was treated with HCl (0.1 mol L−1 aq.) solution to remove Na+ ions by ion exchange method present in the sample and after that washed with deionized water followed by heating at 60 °C overnight."
4,Loading of plasmonic Au onto (HBTiO2) nanofibers,"2.3 Loading of plasmonic Au onto (HBTiO2) nanofibers The coating of Au on HBTiO2 fiber performed by a photo deposition method in which 50 mg of HBTiO2 fiber dispersed in a 50 ml solution having 30 ml of deionized (DI) water and 20 ml of methanol. After that, a certain amount of HAuCl4·3H2O aqueous solution added in the above solution and stirred in the dark about 1 h. Then the solution was irradiated using a 300 W xenon lamp with a cutoff filter (λ = 420 nm) for 1 h under continuous stirring. The oxygen from the solution was removed by applying N2 about 30 min before irradiation. The solution was centrifuged and washed with ethanol and DI water several times and dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. The different amount of Au has coated on HBTiO2 fiber as 2 wt%, 4 wt%, 6 wt%, 8 wt% and 10 wt% of Au."
5,Coating of g-C3N4 QD’s onto (Au/HBTiO2) nanofibers,"2.4 Coating of g-C3N4 QD’s onto (Au/HBTiO2) nanofibers The nanostructured g-C3N4 loaded on Au/HBTiO2 fibers by the vapor deposition method using a self-made setup. It consists of a 100 ml crucible having a small cylinder inside (3 cm height). In general, 50 mg of Au/HBTiO2 fibers placed over the top of the cylinder and put 6.0 g of melamine on the side of the cylinder. The covered crucible put in a muffle furnace at a temperature of 520 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 15 °C min−1. After the treatment, the grey color of Au/HBTiO2 fibers changes to yellow that shows nanostructured g-C3N4 grew on the surface of Au/HBTiO2 fibers and named it as HBTACN. As the samples have a different amount of Au loadings like 2 wt%, 4 wt%, 6 wt%, 8 wt% and 10 wt% of Au so they denoted as HBTACN-2, HBTACN-4, HBTACN-6, HBTACN-8, and HBTACN-10 respectively. The different melamine amounts (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 g) used while 6.0 g found to be very suitable, so all the characterization was done with a 6.0 g dosage. It is employed that the process of growing g-C3N4 on the surface of the fiber without direct contact with melamine is due to the sublimation ability of melamine and the gaseous phase reaction aspect during the polymerization reaction of melamine to g-C3N4 [69,70]. One sample has also prepared in which loading of g-C3N4 QD’s on HBTiO2 (without Au) is performed, denoted it as HBTCN and compare it with other samples (that have Au coating)."

10,Results and discussion,"In this study, we explored a multistep approach for the coupling of Au, HBTiO2, and g-C3N4 quantum dots. Firstly, the nanofibers of TiO2 prepared by the electrospinning process and got HBTiO2 fibers after experiencing alkali-hydrothermal method, ion exchange, and calcination process. These branched nanostructures revealed a high surface area, which is a critical factor for the advancement of the photocatalytic process. Secondly, Au nanoparticles deposited on the HBTiO2 fibers by a photo deposition method, and after that, g-C3N4 QD’s were coated on the Au/HBTiO2 fibers by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The schematic illustration of the whole process shown in scheme 1 . The coating of g-C3N4 QD’s has led to the separation of charge carriers, reduction in the recombination process and hence enhanced the photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen generation. Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of the samples. It can be seen in Fig. 1a and b that the surface of TiO2 nanofibers is uniform and smooth while Fig. 1c displays the needle-like structures on the surface of TiO2 fiber that came after the alkali hydrothermal treatment. It shows that a substantial number of secondary nanowires have successfully in situ grown on the surface with exceptionally high density. After the deposition of Au and coating of g-C3N4 QD’s, we can see in Fig. 1d that the structure remains the same. The detail internal crystal structure and microstructure of the samples investigated by using TEM. Fig. 2 a and b displayed a nanowire with high density. After the loading of g-C3N4 QDs, Fig. 2a shows the HBTCN sample in which nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on the surface of nanowires with an average size of 3.42 ± 1.95 nm (Fig. 3 a). Fig. 2b–d depicts the presence of Au nanoparticles (6–12 nm) as well as g-C3N4 QD’s on the hairy surface of fibers. High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2c) divulge that the lattice fringes spacing of 0.35 nm and 0.24 nm correlated to the (1 0 1) and (0 0 1) crystal planes of anatase (JCPDS 21-1272) [92] and rutile (JCPDS 21-1276) [93]. The spacing of Au fringes is about 0.236 nm correspond to (1 1 1) crystal plane that shows the formation of Au on the surface of HBTiO2 during the photo deposition process. The TEM images (Fig. 2d) also show that the Au nanoparticles are uniform in size that depicts consistent in photocatalytic performance. The TEM observation shows that the different mass loading of Au led to irregular size. (Fig. 3b). The SAED image of the composite (inset of Fig. 2d) shows a spotted ring-like structure that depicts the polycrystalline nature of both the samples. The EDS elemental mapping images of the composite sample shows in the Fig. 2(e–i) in which Ti (blue) and O (purple) depicts the formation TiO2 while Red and orange color represents the C and N respectively and Au in Fig. 2i represent in yellow color indicates the exact heterogeneous formation of Au, HBTiO2, and g-C3N4. The crystal phase and composition of the samples revealed by XRD shown in Fig. 3c. The diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 should appear at 2θ values of 13.0° (1 0 0) and 27.5° (0 0 2) (JCPDS, Card No. 87-1526) [94] but the only highest diffraction peak (27.5°) of g-C3N4 can be found in all the samples while weak reflection peak may disappear due to decrease planar size of the layer. All the samples show the diffraction peaks of TiO2 with 2θ values at 25.38°, 37.88°, 48.08°, 53.91°, and 75.0° can be well indexed to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), and (2 0 4) depicts the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS card No. 21–1272) and rutile phase at 36.3° (1 0 1), 41.3° (1 1 1), and 54.2° (2 1 1) (JCPDS card No. 21-1276). The change in the phase of TiO2 from anatase to rutile is because of the calcination of melamine at high temperatures. The one diffraction peak of g-C3N4 at 13.0° (1 0 0) well-matched while the other just overlapped with the peak of the rutile phase at 27.5° (1 1 0) planes. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of Au can only be observed when the loading of Au is 6% or more than 6 wt% with 2θ values of 38.2°(1 1 1), 44.4° (2 0 0) and 64.4° (2 2 0) that corresponds the presence of Au (JCPDS 04-0784) [95]. The XRD results are steady with the lattice fringes experiential through HRTEM images. The optical properties of the samples were performed by UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption (DRS) spectra, as shown in Fig. 3d. The HBTCN sample absorbs the light near 400 nm because the coating of g-C3N4 QDs gives a retort to the visible light, which improved the reflection band of TiO2. However, as the amount of Au loading increases the absorbance of the material as well as the new broadband emerged at about 560 nm ascribed to the SPR engendered by the collective oscillations of extremely energetic electrons on the surface of Au NPs. The bandgap of the samples was found using Tauc’s plot (inset of Fig. 3d). The bandgap of HBTCN and HBTACN-6 was calculated as 2.99 eV and 2.64 eV, respectively. Thus, the enhancement in the absorption of visible light proved that Au NP’s could utilize maximum visible light by SPR effect and increase the photocatalytic performance. The chemical composition and valence state of the samples investigated using XPS. The survey spectrum of HBTCN and HBTACN-6 (Fig. 4 a) indicates the presence of Ti, O, C, N, and Au, which is well-matched with the elemental mapping and XRD results. The high-resolution spectrum of Au (Fig. 4b) depicts two main peaks at 83.1 eV, and 87.1 eV corresponds to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively that propose the metallic state of Au NPs [96]. The high-resolution XPS data of Ti 2p (Fig. 4c) displays two peaks at 458.4 e, and 464.1 eV that recognized to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 respectively and the splitting of 5.7 eV designates the oxidation states of Ti+4 [19]. The two peaks of O1s in Fig. 4d at 529.8 eV and 531.1 eV indicates the Ti-O linkages and surface hydroxyl group, respectively [97]. As shown in Fig. 4e of C 1s of HBTACN-6 and HBTCN samples, we found two peaks at 284.4 eV that is for graphite-like sp2 (C-C) bonding and relates to graphite carbon nitride while the peak at 288.1 eV indicates N-C=N group of sp2 carbon bonded nitrogen [46]. The bandgap energy of the C 1s state has been shifted little towards high bandgap energy that shows the strong interaction between the material of the sample. The shifting of C1s is primarily due to the high concentration of Sp2 carbon in the graphite sample. However, the shifts are ascribed to the electrons transferring from g-C3N4 to HBTiO2 at the junction, which results in the generation of interfacial internal electric fields (IEF) between the two semiconductors. The solid solution structure could promote the electron transformation from g-C3N4 to HBTiO2 consequently increasing the electron density of catalytically active sites, which was reported to facilitate the reaction of water splitting. The XPS spectrum of N 1s shows three strong peaks at 398.5 eV, 399.7 eV and 401.2 eV corresponded to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen (C-N=C), sp3 bonded nitrogen (N-C3) and C-N-H respectively [98]. There is also a small peak that corresponds to π-excitations. These XPS results ensure the formation of a good composite between HBTiO2, Au, and g-C3N4 QDs heterostructure. The specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the samples characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption curves. According to IUPAC classification, the prepared samples have type IV nitrogen adsorption isotherm and type H3 hysteresis loop, as shown in Fig. 5 a that indicates the presence of mesopores [99]. The specific surface area of all the samples is given in Table 1 . It is clear from Table 1 that the HBTCN sample has the highest surface area of about 92.39 m2g−1 rather than Au loaded samples. Conspicuously, the surface area of the HBTACN samples reduces due to the loading of Au as Au particles fill the pores of the TiO2 surface. Among them, HBTACN-6 composite sample has the surface area up to 72.48 m2g−1. It is said that the more Au loading can decrease the specific surface area of the semiconductor because this type of complex heterogeneous composite like metal/oxide, the BET method seems inadequate to find the specific surface area as nitrogen absorption is very poor on the metal surface [100]. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method was used to investigate the pore size and volume of the reported samples, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5a. Both the samples show almost the same pore size, which indicates that the photo deposition method only deposits Au on the surface and does not alter the structure of HBTiO2. It revealed that the surface area did not affect the photocatalytic performance because the SPR effect of Au noble metal strongly absorbs the visible light, and the heterostructure mechanism supports the separation of electron-holes carriers. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra were performed to comprehend the LSPR charge pair recombination in all the samples. The samples were excited at 375 nm (Fig. 5b). It implies three different TRPL decay components that were fitted by a multi-exponential decay function. The results of the samples are given in (Table 2 ) which shows the decreasing trend of the lifetime of the samples by increasing the amount of Au loading. It means the TRPL intensity decreased as the Au loading increased that’s hindered the radiative recombination of LSPR charge pairs [101]. The τ1 and τ2 denote the fast recombination of excitons while τi might correspond to the diffusion of LSPR excited electrons, which decreased by increasing the Au loading. It indicates that the higher amount of Au enhanced the radiative recombination of long-lived LSPR charge pairs [102]. There is a possibility that the interfacial region of Au NPs and the HBTiO2 surface could create defective sites for the recombination [103]. Moreover, the enhanced charge carrier interaction in the plasmonic system also causes a reduction in a lifetime. The previous reports also confirm similar phenomena [104–106]. The hydrogen evolution by water splitting under visible light irradiation of all the samples shown in Fig. 6 a. All the samples can generate hydrogen gas under visible light irradiation. The sample HBTACN-6 composite evolved the highest amount of hydrogen, which is about 2.22 mmol g−1 h−1 in comparison to the HBTCN sample that only produces 0.35 mmol g−1 h−1. We can see that HBTCN sample performance is negligible; in fact, it has a high specific surface area, and the decay time is also short. Furthermore, the photocatalyst practical application needs to sustain its stability for a long time. Fig. 6b demonstrated that the HBTACN-6 composite sample exhibits workable photocatalytic performance after five cycles without any loss in the hydrogen generation rate. Furthermore, SEM (Fig. 7 a), XRD pattern (Fig. 7b) and TEM image (Fig. 7c) of used HBTACN-6 sample display same phase structure and morphology even after 30 h of photocatalytic reactions in comparison to a fresh one, indicating excellent stability and reusability of the as-prepared samples. The SEM image (Fig. 7a), depicts that after the reaction the morphology remains branched 1D but becomes short nanofiber instead of continuous fiber as seen before reaction that might be due to the strong stirring up to 30 h. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) test analyzed to further proved why the photocatalytic activity of the sample is high. Electrochemical Impedance Spectra (EIS) was studied to exemplify the charge separation and transfer progression. The Nyquist plot consists of different semicircles of all the samples has shown in Fig. 6c. The diameter of the semicircle epitomizes the charge transfer while larger the diameter highest the transfer resistance. The equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 6c) was used to fit the EIS data. The components of the model are Rs (solution resistance), Rct (charge transfer resistance), CPEdl, (capacitance of electrochemical double layer), CPE (constant phase element) and the R of depleting layer [107]. Table 3 showed the results which confirmed that sample HBTACN-6 presented the lowest Rct. It is also evident from the plot that the HBTACN-6 composite has the smallest semicircle, which means it has the lowest charge transfer resistance. The lowest value might be due to the smallest size of Au NPs or the g-C3N4 QD’s that reduces the transition distance between the photogenerated charge carriers. The other reason could be the strong interfacial region due to the mass loading of Au NPs or the g-C3N4 QD’s that separate the photogenerated electron and holes [108]. Hence, the composite separates the electron-hole separation and helps to reduce the charge recombination. Fig. 6a shows the chronoamperometric i-t curves of all the samples that performed after repeated cycles of on/off illumination. The results illustrated that HBTACN-6 composite sample has the highest transient photocurrent density that advocates the stable and robust contact between Au, HBTiO2 and g-C3N4 QDs which allows the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers [108]. Notably, the H2 evolution efficiency of the sample HBTACN-6 is more than 10 times higher than that of the sample HBTCN while the photocurrent density of the sample is only 2.3 times higher. This difference further demonstrated the superiority of the regaular1D nanostructure that the unique 1D mesh structure was propitious for the desorption of generated H2 from the reaction sites, consequently improving the kinetics of the H2 evolution process. Moreover, the quantum efficiency of the hydrogen evolution of all the samples was tested under visible light irradiation. The QE of HBTACN-6 sample for HER at 420 nm is 19.5% that is much higher than HBTCN (0.97%) indicating that the heterojunction formed by combining Au, HBTiO2 and g-C3N4 QDs has dramatically improved the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalysis is the chemical process in which solar energy is harvested to split water molecules to get hydrogen. The incident light falls on the semiconductor photocatalyst, the electrons at valence band (VB) absorbs the energy, get excited and jumps towards the conduction band (CB) leaving a hole behind at VB. There are two reactions that take place during water splitting, one is the water oxidation reaction which releases oxygen (OER) and the other is water reduction in which hydrogen is produced (HER). Moreover, the change of Gibbs free energy of +237.2 kJ/mole energy is required to split one molecule of water having 1.23 V of required potential. The potential of VB should be more positive than 1.23 V vs NHE while CB should be more negative than the 0 V vs NHE. The efficient photocatalytic mechanism for the hydrogen production under visible light proposed in Fig. 7d. The improvement in the photocatalytic performance suggested that the combination of Au NP’s, HBTiO2 and g-C3N4 QDs produces a synergistic effect for the separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and absorb the maximum visible spectra due to the SPR effect of Au NPs as studied by Xue et al [109]. Furthermore, Zhang et al reported that the heterostructure between Au and excited semiconductor play a substantial role in enhancing photocatalytic performance by developing synergetic effect [110]. When light falls on the photocatalyst, the electrons from the valence band (VB) and holes from the conduction band (CB) generated and made a Mott Schottky junction between Au NPs and Semiconductor [111]. An et al mentioned that photoexcited semiconductor has more charge carriers so they have higher conductivity [112]. Therefore, it acts as a mediator for the fast movement of hot electrons to the nearby material. Here, in this study Au NPs absorbs visible light, the electrons get excited to the SPR state that is mostly above the CB of the lowest semiconductor, and these electrons move towards the CB of semiconductor and participate in the photocatalysis. As the light falls on the photocatalyst, the electrons (e-) of HBTiO2 and g-C3N4 QDs get excited and move from valence bond (VB) to conduction band (CB) while leaving the holes (h+) behind at VB. Based on the previous studies [113–115], the conduction edge of g-C3N4 QDs is more negative than that of HBTiO2 that’s why electrons present at CB of g-C3N4 QDs transferred to the CB of HBTiO2. Furthermore, the VB potential of HBTiO2 is higher than that of g-C3N4 QDs, so the holes present at VB of HBTiO2 quickly moves towards the VB of g-C3N4 QDs. The electron generated at CB of g-C3N4 QDs moves towards CB of HBTiO2 and in the meantime the hot electrons produced at Au surface due to the SPR effect also transfer to the CB of HBTiO2. These collected photoelectrons that accumulated by Au NPs contributed in the photocatalytic hydrogen production and depicts the photocatalytic mechanism of Type-II system that is well matched with the previous studies [114,116]. The electrons react with protons and holes reacts with water to do photoreduction and photo-oxidation reaction, respectively. Subsequently, the heterostructure process provides separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and minimize charge recombination, which improves the photocatalytic performance."
11,Conclusion,"We have successfully fabricated the composite of branched TiO2, Plasmonic Au, and g-C3N4 QDs by a simple method. The photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution has also improved drastically by the LSPR effect of Au. It generates the maximum amount of hydrogen about 2.22 mmol g−1 h−1. The formation of the heterostructure type II system remarkably promotes the separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs. The improvement in photocatalytic activity attributed due to the coating of g-C3N4 QDs that changed the optical property and the effective reduction of charge recombination by the 1D structure of TiO2. Besides, the LSPR effect of Au greatly improves the photocatalytic performance under visible light. The ability of excellent photoresponse of this type of composite has great potential in the field of clean energy production, solar cells, Li-ion batteries, and photosynthesis system."
