0,Introduction,"With reducing fossil fuel, much study has been performed to the production of chemicals with renewable sources. Recently, the employment of solar as a renewable source to produce chemical reactions is particular interest in worldwide since sunlight that has many benefits including economical, sustainable and eco-friendliness (Narayanam and Stephenson, 2011). Especially, solar energy is widely investigated as clean fuels because of efficient generation of hydrogen and oxygen molecules by splitting water through photocatalyst to decrease environmental pollution (Matsuoka et al., 2007; Ni et al., 2007A; Nowotny et al., 2005; Tributsch, 2008). Some metals have appropriate properties for using as a photocatalyst. Hematite, indium sulfide, TiO2, ZnO, WO3, SrTiO3, KTaO3, Schiff base Mn(III) complex and NiCr layered double hydroxide (LDH) due to suitable band gap, electron-hole pair lifetime, and charge mobility, have been proposed as a photocatalyst (Kudo, 2003; Fu et al., 2010; Sivula et al., 2011; Duret and Grätzel, 2005; Katz et al., 2012; Kudo and Miseki, 2009; He et al., 2009; Augugliaro et al., 2008; Palmisano et al., 2007; Li et al., 2014; Herzog et al., 2009; Kobayashi et al., 2014; Mobley et al., 2018; Kawasaki et al., 2014; Hagiwara et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2014; Azar et al., 2015; Martín del Campo et al., 2011; Seftel et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2009). These materials can be used to water oxidation reaction. However, some of these approaches are associated with one or more drawbacks such as poor stability, low activity, and biotoxicity. Thus, the development of efficient and stable photocatalysts has always been an interesting task for organic chemists. Among a new generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts, LDHs is a highly efficient photocatalyst. LDHs have many advantages such as anion exchange ability, stability, compositional flexibility, biocompatibility, nontoxicity, low coast and easy preparation (He et al., 2009; Augugliaro et al., 2008; Palmisano et al., 2007; Li et al., 2014; Herzog et al., 2009). LDHs are a family of brucite like solids with commonly chemical formula [MII 1–x MIII x (OH)2] x+ (A n– ) x/n ·yH2O; which MII and MIII are the divalent and trivalent layer cations, respectively. MII and MIII cations may be Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Al3+, Fe3+, etc. occupied octahedral holes and An- is the exchangeable anion that located in the interlayer region. The molar ratio of M2+/ (M2++ M3+) is equal to the amount of x (about of 0.2–0.33) (Ghiasi Moaser and Khoshnavazi, 2017). The LDH is constructed by positively charged layers of metal hydroxides, balanced by interlayer anions and water molecules that located between the layers. The selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones are one of the most widely studied reactions because of their extensive employment in the synthesis of many spices, vitamins and fine chemicals in the laboratory and industrial chemistry (Lucio Anelli et al., 1987; Li et al., 2012; Jagadeesh et al., 2013; Velusamy and Punniyamurthy, 2004). In this work, MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs Nanosheets synthesized with good crystallinity as a novel photocatalyst for oxidation of benzyl alcohol derivatives to benzoic acid derivative under visible light in water. Moreover, this Nanosheets as high efficient catalyst system was applied for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under air with excellent yield in DMF. Furthermore, MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs could be easily recovered and reused for five times."

7,Results and discussion,
8,Preparation and characterization of the catalyst,"3.1 Preparation and characterization of the catalyst The MnO2@Mg-Al LDH was prepared according to the procedure summarized in Scheme 1 . Firstly, MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs was synthesized by adopting a hydrothermal process by using KMnO4 and MnSO4.3H2O as manganese source. α-MnO2 was dispersed in water and the pH of the solution was adjusted by NaOH solution. Separately, Solutions of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O and Al(NO3)3.9H2O were prepared in water then MnO2@Mg-Al LDH was prepared by added dropwise this solution to solution of α-MnO2. The successful synthesis of the MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs nanoparticles were investigated using FT-IR spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectra of α-MnO2 (red curve), MgAl LDHs (green curve) and MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs (purple curve) nanoparticles. As can be seen, the peak around at 3417–3453 cm−1 was correspond to OH stretching modes of interlayer water molecules and H-bonded OH groups attribute to bending mode of water molecules observed near 1619–1625 cm−1. The strong absorbance bands at 1357–1382 and 762 cm−1 indicate the presence of NO3 −. The weak peak near region from 500 to 800 cm−1 was related to the lattice vibration bands of the M–O and O–M–O (where Mg, Mn and Al) groups, in good agreement with literatures (Aisawa, 2006; Pazoki et al., 2019a; Pazoki et al., 2019b). To realize the size and the morphological control effect of MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs, α-MnO2 and MgAl LDHs prepared products were investigated by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the α-MnO2 shows typical nanorod morphology with uniform size distribution that lengths of nanorod is about several hundreds of nanometers and its diameter is less than 50 nm. The α-MnO2 nanorods have a rectangle cross-section. For the control experiment without addition of α-MnO2, the morphology of the product is investigated that morphology MgAl LDH is determined plate-like with mean diameter of about 200 nm and the thickness is approximately 10–20 nm. Fig. 2c and d show that core-shell MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs particles have a three-dimensional nanostructure. This indicates that the monolayer assembly of LDH crystals on α-MnO2 surface was successfully obtained with electrostatic interaction. The negatively charged surface of the α-MnO2 adhered on the LDH with a maximum face-to-face contact. It was found that the hierarchical layer of LDH grows horizontally on the surface of the α-MnO2 nanorod. In addition, TEM revealed additional structural features, the size of MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs exhibited about 1500 nm (Fig. 2 d). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was also used to give information about the elements present in the MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs. EDX analysis of MnO2@Mg-Al LDH confirms the presence of Mg, O, Al, N and Mn elements (Fig. 3 and Table 1 ). EDX analysis clearly shows that the nanoparticles are rich in O, but it has less N and Mg. furthermore, the content of Mn is very low, which only are 3.29% in the test area. Magnesium, Aluminum, and manganese content were determined with inductively coupled plasma atom emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) as listed in Table 2 . Moreover, manganese content in MnO2@Mg-Al LDH catalyst was determined. ICP analysis indicated that Pd contents were 6.2%. The crystalline structures of the MgAl LDH and MnO2@Mg-Al LDH were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. 4 . seven characteristic peaks (2θ = 11.65°, 23.42°, 34.88°, 39.44°, 46.92°, 60.76° and 62.11°) corresponding to (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110) and (113) planes of the regular layered structure of MgAl LDHs (Katanić-Popović et al., 1991) and the peak at around 28° is related to α-MnO2 (310) (Xu et al., 2006). In addition, crystallinity of structure was investigated that is calculated 21.67% and show in Table 3 . The specific surface area of LDH and MnO2@Mg-Al LDH can be determined by N2 adsorption-desorption experiment. A typical isothermal of the LDH and MnO2@Mg-Al LDH samples are shown in Fig. 5 . Isotherms of LDH and MnO2@Mg-Al LDH showed a type IV isotherm, and the samples were microporous material. With the adding of MnO2, the hysteresis loop became shorter, corresponding to a reduction of pore volume. The BET surface area of LDH was 51 m2 g−1. The BET surface area of MnO2@Mg-Al LDH was increased to 87 m2 g−1 due to the presence of MnO2."
9,The oxidation of benzyl alcohol by MnO2@Mg-Al LDH,"3.2 The oxidation of benzyl alcohol by MnO2@Mg-Al LDH Here the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was used as model reaction. The effects of the temperature, oxidant and solvent was investigated on the model reaction (Table 4 , entries 1–16). The model reaction was carried out in H2O, CH3CN, DMF and toluene. The reactions did not performed when CH3CN and toluene used as solvents. The best result is obtained when DMF was used under air. The product of this condition is benzaldehyde (Table 4, entry 1) but the reaction do not gave yield under visible light irradiation(Table 4, entry 9) also the reaction gave excellent yield when water was replaced by other solvents under visible light irradiation at room temperature that the product of reaction is an acid benzoic (Table 4, entry 11) and also this product is produced when water was used as solvent at 100 °C under air (Table 4, entry 3). In addition, the amount of catalyst is invegisted for model reaction, the best result is 0.1 g catalyst when DMF was used as solvent and 0.05 g is the best amount of catalyst for oxidation benzyl alcohol under visible light irradiation finally reaction optimized in different temperature and the best result for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to aldehyde and benzoic acid are 120 °C and room temperature respectively. In the absence of air, No conversion of benzyl alcohol was observed even when heating to 120 °C in DMF. Similarly, without visible light irradiation, No conversion of benzyl alcohol was performed when using water as solvent at 25 °C. In order that, oxidation of benzyl alcohol under air and visible light irradiation was also performed in standard condition by various benzyl alcohols (Tables 6 and 7). In addition, we invegisted activity of catalyst for MgAl LDH and α-MnO2 and the result was compered by MnO2@Mg-Al LDH (Table 5 ). As can be seen, it can be realized that the MnO2@Mg-Al LDH catalyst exhibited a good catalytic activity. This novel catalyst is comparable in terms of recyclability, commercially available materials, and easy preparation. Finally, the various benzyl alcohol moiety was investigated under the optimized conditions and the results are summarized in Tables 6 and 7 . To our delight, reactions of a variety of benzyl alcohols were tolerated. Both electron-rich and electron-deficient alcohols gave the corresponding aldehydes and carboxylic acid in good to excellent yields (Table 6 and entry 1a-12a and Table 7 entry 1b -8b). The mechanism of reaction was investigated. The interaction of the MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs surface with benzyl alcohol is suggested as shown in Fig. 6 : benzyl alcohol molecules can be adsorbed on the OH sites. In mechanism a, UV–visible light has main role in reaction progress that can convert the molecule of water to Hydroxyl radical and Hydroxyl radical attack to benzyl alcohol to produce radical of benzyl alcohol. Finally, reaction benzyl alcohol radical with Hydroxyl radical produce benzoic acid. When O2 was used for oxidation reaction, benzyl alcohol converted to benzaldehyde (mechanism b). The model reaction was performed successfully in the presence of MnO2@Mg-Al LDHs which recovered by centrifuges after each reaction and reused for 5 times without any loss of activity (Fig. 7 )."
