0,Introduction,"There has been considerable recent interest in the field of organometallic and inorganic chemistry at the interface with biology [1a–n]. Organometallic hydrides, as catalysts, have been shown to undergo reduction reactions with biomimetic and natural NAD+ co-factors for chemoselective 1,4-NADH co-factor regeneration, and have now been utilized in many biocatalytic reactions. For example, this co-factor regeneration reaction of essential 1,4-NADH derivatives was utilized in tandem with 1,4-NADH co-factor dependent redox enzymes, for organic synthetic reduction and oxidation reactions, including synthesis of chiral organic compounds [1k,2a–h]. Thus, Fish et al, and others, have previously reported on the utilization and mechanistic aspects of the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ complex as a chemoselective 1,4-NADH regeneration agent, in tandem with Zn(II) mediated, 1,4-NADH-dependent horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, HLADH-Zn(II), a redox enzyme for both achiral ketone reduction to chiral alcohols, and the reverse oxidation of chiral alcohols to their achiral ketone equivalent [3a–h]. Redox enzymes, in particular, have been utilized in tandem biocatalytic conversions, and can also be regarded as “reaction pathway switches,” because of the important chemo and stereoselective control exerted on the processes they catalyze [4a–c]. The capability of operating under mild conditions, and in an aqueous biocompatible media, contributed to enzymes being particularly appealing in the design of green chemical processes, thus providing a motivation for the employment and development of new biocatalysis reactions in chemical synthesis [1j,5a,b]. The active core of many enzymes includes a metal ion center, trapped in the protein structure, via coordinative binding, that has been shown to often be critical for the catalytic activity, and dramatically enhances the chemical reactivity [6a,b]. Alternatively, the confinement induced by the protein structure, and the subsequent occurrence of metal ion-substrate interactions, far from the aqueous medium, also has a dramatic impact on the catalytic activity of metal ion-based enzymes, thus switching on novel chemical reactivity [7,8]. In these tandem biocatalytic related studies, postulated mechanistic pathways that were not always entirely definitive, including those concerning co-factor regeneration with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ as the regeneration catalyst for NAD+ conversion to 1,4-NADH, in tandem with the 1,4-NADH dependent redox enzyme, HLADH-Zn(II) [1a,3c,d]. To study the mechanism of reduction of natural NAD+ to 1,4-NADH with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, Fish et al. previously utilized biomimetic models of NAD+ to simplify the biochemical process, and found surprisingly, in a totally serendipitous manner, that biomimetic NAD+ analogues, N-benzylnicotinamide triflate, 1, and β-nicotinamide ribose-5′-methyl phosphate, 2, in the chemoselective conversion to their 1,4-NADH analogues, 1,4-dihydro-N-benzylnicotinamide, 4, and β-1,4-dihydronicotinamide-5′-ribose methyl phosphate, 5, with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, were recognized by the 1,4-NADH dependent HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme in reduction of achiral ketones to chiral S-alcohols [2a,3c]. The present quantum chemical DFT studies have highlighted the essential roles played by both [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ and the HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme, in managing the hydride transfer reaction pathways. More importantly, recent publications have shown that the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ undergoes a tautomeric equilibrium rearrangement to [(η4-Cp*H)Rh(bpy)]+, and it was speculated that this latter complex was responsible for the formation of 1,4-NADH, rather than [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+. [9] Moreover, previous studies [6] have also stated that the role of Zn(II) in HLADH catalysis was restricted to the stabilization of the enzyme coordination site, as well as, substrate coordination/activation. However, we now propose, via DFT calculations, that Zn(II) has an essential role in the enantioselective hydride transfer process, and that [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, and not its equilibrium tautomer, [(η4-Cp*H)Rh(bpy)]+, was responsible for the chemoselective reduction of biomimetic NAD+ co-factors, 1 and 2, to their 1,4-NADH analogues, 4 and 5."

2,"Biomimetic NAD+ Co-factors, 1 and 2, in the Chemoselective Reduction to 1,4-NADH Co-factors, 4 and 5, with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+: Mechanistic Postulates, I and II.","2.1 Biomimetic NAD+ Co-factors, 1 and 2, in the Chemoselective Reduction to 1,4-NADH Co-factors, 4 and 5, with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+: Mechanistic Postulates, I and II. The regioselective reduction of biomimetic NAD+ co-factors, N-benzylnicotinamide triflate, 1 and β-nicotinamide ribose-5′-methyl phosphate, 2, (Fig. 1 ), catalyzed by the in situ formed [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ complex, was investigated in detail. We used DFT calculations to highlight the key intermediates, and their interconnection to the free energy landscape, yielding a complete insight of both the thermodynamics and kinetics of this process. A structural comparison of biomimetic NAD+ co-factors 1 and 2 to natural NAD+, 3, and their 1,4-NADH analogues, 4, 5, and 6, are also shown in Fig. 1. The previously available mechanistic hypotheses, together with the labeling of their key intermediates and transition states, are shown in Scheme 1 . DFT calculations indicated that the formation of [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ , B, was characterized by a ΔG gain of 26.3 kcal/mol, thus consistent with a quantitative conversion of [Cp*Rh(bpy)H2O]2+ with Na formate to B ( Scheme 1 ). Differentiation of the I and II mechanistic pathways in Scheme 1 takes place, since in analogy to other half-sandwich metal complexes, B can undergo an intramolecular, tautomeric rearrangement, in which the Cp*Rh metal ion center bound hydrogen shifts to a sp2 carbon of the Cp* ligand to provide, B', was discovered by Miller et al., [9] and later by Blakemore et al. [10a,b] and Peters et al. [10c] Notably, the B → B' interconversion can formally be considered an intramolecular, reductive elimination, because of the concomitant Cp*Rh(III) → (η4-Cp*H)Rh(I) reduction. With the exception of the geometrical deviations caused by the one tetrahedral carbon atom, and the η5 → η4 change in hapticity in the Cp*H ligand, the optimized DFT calculations indicated that the structures of B and B' were found to be interestingly very similar (Fig. 2 ). More importantly, our calculations also indicated that [(η4-Cp*H)Rh(bpy)]+, B', was found to be slightly more stable than [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, B; however, the free energy differences in water were only 1 kcal/mol, thus suggesting that both tautomeric complexes were present in equilibrium. Therefore, the calculated activation free energy for the B → B' conversion was ΔG = 16 kcal/mol, further corroborating the fast B ⇄ B' interconversion in aqueous solution. In conjunction with both mechanistic postulates, I and II (Scheme 1), the DFT calculations were focused on the potential O-coordination of the N-benzylnicotinamide triflate's amide carbonyl, 1, to the Cp*Rh metal ion center, for either the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, B, or [(η4-Cp*H)Rh(bpy)]+, B', reactants, respectively. Interestingly, no optimized structure of a σ-bonded B' to the biomimetic co-factor, N-benzylnicotinamide triflate, 1, could be obtained, since the particularly high electron density at the (η4-Cp*H)Rh(I) metal ion center disfavored the coordination of another ligand; > 40 kcal/mol higher than that for [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ and co-factor 1. Several calculations were also performed to locate the transition state for the concerted O-coordination/hydride transfer on 1 catalyzed by [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, B. In fact, all attempts led to higher energy structures characterized by the partial decomplexation of either the bpy or Cp* ligand. Further analyses of the electronic structure of the metal ion center in [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ , B, confirmed the presence of unoccupied low-energy orbitals with the right symmetry to overlap with the sp2 lone pair of the amide oxygen; LUMO+3, LUMO+6, and LUMO+7 (Fig. 3 ). In fact, these orbitals were featured by nodal elements denoting their anti-bonding character, and causing the partial decomplexation of either the bpy or Cp* ligand, when the coordination of the amide oxygen involves either LUMO+6/LUMO+6 or LUMO+3, respectively. Alternatively, the LUMO+4 orbital was expanded into the second coordination sphere of [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, mostly in the region of space limited by the bpy surface and the Cp* methyl groups, and moreover, had no nodal elements dissecting the coordinative bonds of either the bpy or Cp* ligand (Fig. 3). In seeking viable alternative mechanisms, we considered the formation of non-covalent interactions between either B or B’ with biomimetic NAD+ co-factor, 1. The most favorable non-covalent interactions between the nicotinamide group of the biomimetic co-factor, 1, with either the B or B' scaffolds were obtained by essentially taking into account the charge distribution on these molecular fragments (Scheme 2 ). In the optimized structures of C2 and C2′, the orientation of 1(R = benzyl), with respect to each Cp*Rh moiety, was substantially maintained. The C=O of the 3-amide group and the aromatic C4−H bond of the nicotinamide ring formed non-covalent interactions shown in Scheme 2, by involving the Rh-H, Cp*/η4-Cp* ligands, and the tertiary C–H bond of the η4-Cp*H ligand. The optimized structure of C2 also displayed a short Cp*Rh–H⋅⋅⋅⋅H–C4 contact on the nicotinamide ring that further stabilized the interaction between the two molecular components, and favored the approach of 1 to the hydride donor group. Compared to the C2 structure, carbon C4 on the nicotinamide ring of C2′ was placed approximately 0.1 Å further from the tertiary Cp*C–H bond on the η4-Cp*H ligand, while 1 was almost parallel in a π-stacking conformation to the bpy ligand plane; however, no π-π interactions were evident (Fig. 4 ). The formation of either the structures of the C2 or C2′ non-covalent interactions were endergonic by 10.4 and 2.8 kcal/mol, respectively, thus indicating that the interactions between the Cp*Rh(III) metal ion center and 1 were weak in both cases, and were further compromised by an unfavorable entropy loss. Structure C2 and C2′ may then undergo a hydride transfer, to afford the corresponding 1,4-NADH products. The optimized structures for hydride transfer of Cp*RhH to carbon C4 and for (η4-Cp*H)Rh to C4′ provided transition states, ts3 and ts3′, respectively, and are shown in Fig. 5 . In both transition states, ts3 and ts3′, we observed that non-covalent interactions, involving the C=O of the 3-amide group in 1, were maintained, and that the nicotinamide ring was oriented parallel to the bpy ligand plane in a π-stacking conformation, as the hydride transfer was occurring. Alternatively, the activation free energy for the η4-Cp*H carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer of ΔG = 32 kcal/mol, was estimated to be ~ 22 kcal/mol higher than [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, for the Cp*RhH-to-carbon hydride transfer, thus making the mechanistic hypothesis I (Scheme 1), the most kinetically favored; the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, and not [(η4-Cp*H)Rh(bpy)]+, was thought to be responsible for the hydride transfer to biomimetic NAD+ co-factors 1 and 2, as well as, natural NAD+, 3. The subsequent formation of structure D2, where the biomimetic 1,4-NADH co-factor, 4, was still non-covalently bound to the Cp*Rh(III) moiety, providing a junction between the two mechanistic hypotheses; indeed, the C-to-C hydride transfer in structure C2′ was coupled with the (η4-Cp*H)Rh(I) → Cp*Rh(III) oxidation of the metal ion center. The optimized structure of D2 resembled the structure of ts3; the C=O⋅⋅⋅⋅H–C non-covalent interactions, and a π-stacking arrangement of the nicotinamide ring over the bpy plane, was observed. Furthermore, an appreciably short Cp*Rh⋅⋅⋅⋅H-C distance, 1.98 Å, was also detected, indicating that a strong agostic interaction was formed between the 1,4-NADH product and the Cp*Rh(III) metal ion center (Fig. 6 ). The calculated free energy profiles for the reduction of 1 catalyzed by [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, B, (Scheme 1) was provided by DFT calculations, while connecting all reactants along either the I or II mechanistic hypothesis, which are shown in Scheme 3 . Clearly, the most viable mechanistic hypothesis included the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, complex B, as the hydride donor, and it was postulated that the catalyst regeneration may occur through the substitution of the formate ion to yield A (Scheme 1). The calculated activation free energy for the formation of B, via the β-elimination of CO2 (Scheme S1), ΔG = ~ 16 kcal/mol, was similar to the experimentally determined value of ΔG = 17 kcal/mol reported by Fish et al, [3d] and suggested that the A→B reaction may be rate determining. More importantly, calculations showed that the further reaction of B with the N-benzylnicotinamide triflate, 1, was characterized by a much lower barrier, ΔG = ~10 kcal/mol, which was required for the formation of the non-covalent reactants seen in structure C2 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the subsequent hydride transfer step was almost barrierless, while the free energy of ts3 was found to be slightly lower than that of C2 (Scheme 3). The formation of [(η4-Cp*H)Rh(bpy)]+, B', in equilibrium with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, B, was also confirmed, even though the latter was the only species found to be viable for donating a hydride to the nicotinamide ring, C4-H position. To reiterate, the activation free energy for the C-to-C donation from B' to 1 was found to be ~32 kcal/mol, thus the mechanistic hypothesis II was not found to be plausible from a kinetic standpoint (Scheme 3). A similar conclusion was recently reached by Fontecave et al., in their chemical/DFT study of [Cp*Rh(R-bpy)Cl]+ complexes, concerning the photoreduction of CO2 to formic acid. [11] The intermediate complex resulting from the chemoselective Cp*RhH-to-C4 hydride transfer, structure D2, with non-covalent interactions between 1 and the coordinatively unsaturated intermediate of [Cp*Rh(bpy)]2+, which can then react again with formate ion to afford A, and continue the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, our calculations also indicated that this latter step was slightly endergonic, by ~ 4 kcal/mol, thus ensuring that, in the presence of high concentrations of formate, the amount of A was sufficient enough to provide a catalytic recycle of [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, complex B (Scheme 1)."
3,"Electronic Effects for the Chemoselective Reduction of NAD+ Biomimetic Co- factors, N-Benzylnicotinamide Triflate, 1, N-Methylnicotinamide Triflate,7, N-Benzyl-3-Cyanonicotine Triflate,8, and N-Benzyl-3-Methylnicotine Triflate,9, with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, including Non-covalent Binding Regimes","2.2 Electronic Effects for the Chemoselective Reduction of NAD+ Biomimetic Co- factors, N-Benzylnicotinamide Triflate, 1, N-Methylnicotinamide Triflate,7, N-Benzyl-3-Cyanonicotine Triflate,8, and N-Benzyl-3-Methylnicotine Triflate,9, with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, including Non-covalent Binding Regimes The replacement of the 3-amide substituent, 3-C(O)NH2 of the biomimetic co-factor, 1, with other functional groups, and its impact on the rate of hydride transfer, has been investigated by Fish et al. [3d], by demonstrating that non-coordinating substituents, for example, 3-CH3, were shown to be unreactive, whereas coordinating substituents, such as, 3-C(O)CH3 or 3-CN, essentially provided the same reactivity as NAD+ biomimetic, 1, with the 3-C(O)NH2 group. Based on our computational calculations, we can now demonstrate that the coordinative nature of the substituent on carbon C3 was not totally relevant, since we found that the coordination of the biomimetic co-factor, 1, with the reducing agent, [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, was thermodynamically compromised. Thus, DFT calculations indicated that the various biomimetic co-factors with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ form non-covalent interactions, as depicted in Scheme 4 , while the substituents on the carbon C3 position act by modulating the electrophilicity of the biomimetic co-factor's C4 position. To corroborate this postulate, the reactions between either the 3-CN, 8, 3-CH3, 9, or 3-C(O)NH2, 1, on the N-benzylnicotine triflate nucleus with [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, were investigated at a high DFT level of theory. The calculated structures of either reactant, product, or transition state for the hydride transfer for 3-CN, 8, and 3-CH3, 9, were found to be almost superimposable to those calculated for 3-C(O)NH2, 1, as well as, the activation free energy, ΔG values, for the corresponding hydride transfer processes (Scheme 4). However, our calculations clearly showed the trend of the activation free energy values as, 3-CH3 > 3-C(O)NH2 > 3-CN, and was correlated very well with the electron withdrawing effect of the functional group at the C3 position: 3-CN > 3-C(O)NH2 > 3-CH3. It was also important to understand that the electron-donating effect of the methyl group on the C3 position of N-benzyl-3-methylnicotine triflate, 9, provided an increase of 3.2 kcal/mol of the activation free energy for the Cp*RhH-to-C4 hydride transfer compared to the biomimetic NAD+ co-factor, 1, but also a destabilization of the 1,4-dihydro product formed in the reaction with N-benzyl-3-methylnicotine triflate and [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+. As a consequence, the reaction free energy, ΔG, for the overall hydride transfer yielding the 1,4-NADH biomimetic co-factors, and regeneration of intermediate A (Scheme 1), followed the trend, 3-CN < 3-C(O)NH2 < 3-CH3. This trend essentially corresponded to the hydricity for the considered biomimetic co-factors, where the hydricity can be defined as the tendency of a hydride transfer agent to donate a hydride ion. Thus, electron-withdrawing groups, 3-C(O)NH2 or 3-CN, favor, and stabilize, the incoming hydride ion by making each catalytic cycle irreversibly shifted towards product formation, whereas electron-donating groups, like 3-CH3, disfavored the formation of the 1,4-NADH biomimetic co-factor, and caused the catalytic cycle to be almost an equilibrium between the biomimetic NAD+ and 1,4-NADH forms of the co-factors. Moreover, DFT calculations further indicated that the nature of the substituent on the N1 position of the co-factor's pyridine ring was of less importance. If we substituted the N-benzyl group, 1, with an N-methyl group, 7, on the nicotinamide nucleus, we expected a decrease in the electrophilicity at C4, and consequently, the hydride acceptor capability of the nicotinamide ring. This was suggested in the relative rate data published previously, where the relative rate of the reduction of N-benzyl/N-methylnicotinamide triflate = 2. [3d] The two-fold rate increase of the reduction of co-factor 1 compared to 7 corresponded to less than 1 kcal/mol, in terms of activation free energy values; a difference that was below the commonly accepted error in the DFT estimates of kinetic barriers of approximately 2 kcal/mol. The calculated structures of reactant adduct (RA), product adduct (PA), and the transition state (TS) obtained by the reaction of [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, B, with N-methylnicotinamide triflate, 7, showed only slight deviations from the corresponding structures calculated in the reaction with biomimetic co-factor, 1, and reflected almost superimposable orientations of the two interacting molecular scaffolds (Fig. S1). The activation free energy value of 10.3 kcal/mol for the reduction of co-factor 7 was ~ 2 kcal/mol higher than the one calculated for the co-factor 1, thus very close to the theoretical estimation error. Analogously, the calculated activation free energy for the reaction of [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, B, with the NAD+ biomimetic co-factor, 2, was also found to be ~ 0.3 kcal/mol lower than the value calculated for the reaction of the NAD+ biomimetic co-factor, 1. Further information on the substituent effects was gained by understanding the calculated values of the activation free energy, with the sum of the three contributions: electronic, solvation, and thermal correction (Table 1 ). In all cases, solvation overcompensated the electronic term by 1-3 kcal/mol, while the thermal correction terms were found in the narrow range of 12-15 kcal/mol. This latter term was mostly determined by the loss in translational entropy, attributed to the association of [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, B, and the NAD+ biomimetic co-factors, in the formation of the corresponding transition state structure. However, it is worth noting, in spite of the rather different balances of electronic, solvation, and thermal corrections calculated for the reaction of biomimetic co-factor, β-nicotinamide ribose-5′-methyl phosphate, 2, which was presumably due to the negative charge of the phosphate group, the combination of the three contributions led to an activation free energy value that was comparable to the values obtained for the other biomimetic co-factors."
4,"DFT Mechanism Studies of HLADH-Zn(II) Biocatalysis with Biomimetic 1,4-NADH Co-factors, 4 and 5: The Role of Zn(II) in the Enantioselective Hydride Transfer Process to Zn(II) Bound Achiral Ketones","2.3 DFT Mechanism Studies of HLADH-Zn(II) Biocatalysis with Biomimetic 1,4-NADH Co-factors, 4 and 5: The Role of Zn(II) in the Enantioselective Hydride Transfer Process to Zn(II) Bound Achiral Ketones There have been extensive studies concerning the role of the Zn(II) metal ion center in the biocatalytic mechanisms of all alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes (ADH), including 1,4-NADH dependent horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH)-Zn(II), but none, to our knowledge, have implicated Zn(II)'s role in the hydride transfer from the 1,4-NADH co-factor to the Zn(II) bound ketone carbonyl, to provide chiral S-alcohols. [6] Thus, the generally accepted reaction scheme for (HLADH)-Zn(II) biocatalysis that has been proposed was focused on the Zn(II) metal ion center operating as a Lewis Acid, for activation of the achiral ketone substrates, through coordination of the ketone carbonyl group to Zn(II). This increased the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon atom, and thus, favored the stereoselective transfer of hydride by natural 1,4-NADH, to produce a chiral S-alcohol. [6] More recently, one of us, proposed a (HLADH)-ZnH intermediate, concerning the HLADH biocatalysis mechanism, and this postulate was the inspiration to utilize DFT calculations to determine, more accurately, the possible non-innocent role of Zn(II) in HLADH biocatalytic enzyme reduction reactions (Scheme 5 ) [3c]. In this present DFT mechanism study, we were intrigued by the possibility that there was a non-innocent role of the Zn(II) in the direct participation of the HLADH-Zn(II) metal ion center, during the hydride transfer process to form the chiral S-alcohol products. We previously found that biomimetic 1,4-NADH co-factors, N-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide, 4, and 1,4−dihydro-β-nicotinamide ribose-5′-methyl phosphate, 5 (Fig. 1), were bioactive with the HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme, and were shown, via hydride transfer reactions, to also provide chiral S-alcohols, with high ee values [2a,3c]. Thus, DFT investigations were conducted on a simplified core model of the HLADH-Zn(II) metal ion center, without the surrounding peptide residues. Moreover, this simplified core model consisted of the first coordination sphere of the catalytic Zn(II) metal ion, which was composed of two CH3S- ligands and one imidazole ligand; therefore, modeling the coordination by two Cys and one His ligand, respectively, according to the natural HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme. Furthermore, we also accounted for the coordination of a water ligand occupying the fourth coordination site, which yielded the model thought to be the most representative of the HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme resting state [6,12]. As stated, the natural 1,4-NADH co-factor dependent HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme was modeled with the biomimetic co-factors, 4 and 5, which were actively involved in the HLADH-Zn(II) hydride transfer process for chiral alcohol synthesis, with high ee values, and then compared to the natural 1,4-NADH co-factor, 6 [2a,h, 3c,d]."
5,Formation of the Postulated (HLADH)ZnH Intermediate by a DFT Investigation of the HLADH-Zn(II) Enzyme Kinetics.,"2.4 Formation of the Postulated (HLADH)ZnH Intermediate by a DFT Investigation of the HLADH-Zn(II) Enzyme Kinetics. The thermodynamics of mechanism I (Scheme 5) was initially assessed by the energy analysis for the potential pathways leading to the formation of the Zn(I)H in the HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme catalytic process. In general, the HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme can operate reversibly by promoting either reduction of achiral ketone substrates or, oxidation of chiral alcohols, as shown in Eq. 1, with 2-pentanone/S-2-pentanol. [3c] By assuming the formation of a postulated Zn(I)H intermediate, the HLADH catalyzed reaction can be separated into two component reactions, Eq. 2 and 3. Both reactions, Eq. 2 and 3, led to different rearrangements of the first coordination sphere of Zn((II) that paralleled the formation of the ZnH intermediate. The thermodynamics of seven alternative equations to Eqs. 2 and 3 (a-g, Schemes S1 and S2) were investigated by the use of the simplified core model of the (HLADH)-Zn(II) metal ion center, and the biomimetic 1,4-NADH co-factor, 4. In all examples, the formation of the ZnH, was found to be endothermic in the 17-46 kcal/mol range, with the lowest free energies detected in processes c and d, and implied that the replacement of the neutral imidazole ligand had occurred (Table 2 ). Conversely, all Eq. 3 alternatives (Scheme S2) were exothermic and exergonic by -21-40 and -31-46 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2 ), which implied that the formation of the ZnH in the oxidative route of HLADH, the reverse of Eq. 3, where the alcohol substrate was the hydride source, was found to be much less favored than in the reductive route (Eq. 2). Thus, in the reduction procedure, the calculations demonstrated that processes c and d, both implied the imidazole decomplexation, and were subjected to the lowest free energy costs, Table 2, 17.8 and 18.3 kcal/mol, and can be considered the most viable reaction pathways to the postulated ZnH intermediate. To model the kinetics of the reaction between 2-pentanone and N-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide, 4, that occurred on the Zn(II) metal ion center of the core model of HLADH, we assumed the formation of a ternary complex, consisting of the enzyme-substrate-co-factor triad. A body of X-ray structures of various ADH ternary complexes were available in the PDB archives; these adducts could be isolated by using unreactive carbonyl substrates, such as DMF. [13] In all cases, the biomimetic, 1,4-NADH co-factor, N-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide, 4, was located in the second coordination sphere of the catalytic Zn(II) metal ion center, with the transferable hydride atoms oriented toward the ketone carbonyl group of the bound substrate, 2-pentanone. Two possible geometrical configurations of ternary complexes, R and S , and their stability were evaluated via DFT calculations utilizing the core model of HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme (Scheme 6 ). The enantioselective reduction of 2-pentanone was then investigated with the above mentioned two possible R and S configurations of the substrate, with respect to the incoming hydride donor, the biomimetic cofactor, 4, thus leading to the initial configurations, either pro-R ( R ) or pro-S ( S ), Scheme 6. By starting from these two configurations, the subsequent hydride donation could lead to either tetra-coordinated or penta-coordinated Zn(II) complexes, depending on the occurrence of the ligand exchange, or not. In fact, penta-coordination resulted in an unstable configuration; in all cases studied, the postulated Zn(I)H complex rearranged into the tetra-coordinated configuration, by the decomplexation of the ketone substrate, and this data initially appeared to disfavor the formation of the postulated HLADH-Zn(I)H (mechanism I, Scheme 5), as an intermediate in the reductions of achiral ketones. Thus, DFT calculations were then performed to analyze the ternary complexes for imidazole decomplexation, shown in Scheme 6. Relaxed scan calculations for the gradual elongation of the Zn–N imidazole ligand bond in complexes R and S demonstrated that, in the presence of 4, and in the second coordination sphere, the bond dissociation requires ~ 16 and ~ 10 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig. 7 ). It was noteworthy focusing on the appreciably lower dissociation energy calculated for the S complex, which indicated that the imidazole ligand decomplexation, quite surprisingly, contributed to the enantioselectivity of the Zn(II) catalysis. The analysis of the R and S imidazole decomplexation energies clearly showed that the electronic energy contribution was dominant, and that steric interactions possibly affected the Zn-N dissociation energy in both complexes (Table S3). The imidazole decomplexation, provided a 16e- Zn(II) metal ion center, which was followed by a plausible η2-coordination of the biomimetic 1,4-dihydro-N-benzylnicotinamide, 4, co-factor's double bonds, and led to either the R / S-η2-2,3-Zn(II) or R / S-η2-5,6,-Zn(II) double bond complexes of [Zn(SCH3)2(η2 -4)], respectively (Fig. 8 ). The η2-2,3-Zn(II) complex, S 2,3 , had a rather short distance of 3.20 Å (Fig. 8) between the Zn(II) metal ion center and one of the C4 hydrogens of the 1,4-dihydronicotinamide ring, facilitating the C4-H-to-Zn(II) hydride transfer, following the reaction route I (Scheme 5). DFT calculations were then carried out to locate intermediate and transition state structures downstream to the formation of the η2-2,3-Zn(II) complex, S 2,3 , and eventually provided the free energy profile for the enantioselective formation of S-2-pentanol, via reaction route I (Scheme 7 ). The detailed transfer of the 1,4-NADH co-factor's C4H to the core HLADH-Zn(II) metal ion center of the S2,3 complex was found to be affected by a high activation free energy of 22.4 kcal/mol, and to an overall barrier of 34.0 kcal/mol, if the energy cost for the imidazole decomplexation was also added (Scheme 7). Therefore, these high activation barriers have precluded the viability of the postulated Zn(I)H mechanism I shown in Scheme 5. This is the case even if the downstream steps, Zn(II)-to-substrate hydride transfer occurring in either the R-ZnH or S-ZnH intermediate, were both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable (Scheme 7). Alternatively, the short distance of 2.88 Å (Fig. 8), between the 2-pentanone carbonyl carbon and the C4–H bond on 4, detected in the calculated geometry of the η2-5,6-Zn(II) complex, S 5,6 , suggested that a direct carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer may occur that was found with the previously proposed reaction route II (Scheme 5); however, with the caveat that bonding between the 1,4-NADH co-factor and the Zn(II) metal ion center of HLADH has never been reported, to our knowledge. Thus, DFT calculations provided, for the first time, the free energy profile for the plausible involvement of the favored S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complex, S 5,6 , in the hydride transfer, affording the final experimentally dominate product, S-2-pentanol (Scheme 8 ) [2a,3c]. The formation of η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes, via the imidazole decomplexation, was endergonic by 12.5 and 18.1 kcal/mol for the S 5,6 and R 5,6 starting conformations, respectively (Scheme 8). Thus, indicating that in the early step of the η2-5,6-Zn(II) complex, S 5,6, the S configuration was energetically the most favored (Fig. 8). The ΔG activation free energy for the subsequent hydride transfer step was found to be quite low in either case, being only 9.6 and 11.0 kcal/mol for the ultimate formation of S-2-pentanol and R-2-pentanol, respectively (Scheme 8). To further corroborate our mechanistic postulates, the Zn(II)-catalyzed enantioselective reduction of 4-phenyl-2-butanone, in the presence of co-factor 4, was also investigated at a high DFT level of theory. The optimized structures of either intermediates or transition state for the Zn-catalyzed hydride transfer to the 4-phenyl-2-butanone were found to closely resemble those calculated for the 2-pentanone reaction mechanism. The corresponding free energy profile (Scheme 9 ) also displayed several similarities with the one in the Scheme 8, characterized by an endergonic step for the formation of the R 5,6 /S5,6 reactant adducts followed by a relatively small activation free energy for the C-to-C hydride transfer step. In agreement with the observed enantioselectivity, the overall barrier for the formation of the S-alcohol product was found to be the lowest in both cases, whereas the ΔΔG values of 7 and 2.4 kcal/mol for the reaction of 2-pentanone and 4-phenyl-2-butanone, respectively, would lead to corresponding ee values of > 99% for both formed S-alcohols. It should be noted that, although the last result was not in line with the experimentally determined values of ee 85% and 93% for S-2-pentanol and S-4-phenyl-2-butanol, [2a] respectively, the core HLADH-Zn(II) model essentially lacked the protein environment that was expected to both sterically and electrostatically assist the reaction steps. This aspect would likely determine the activation free energies affecting the R or S reaction pathways. Alternatively, the DFT calculations clearly showed how the reaction of 4-phenyl-2-butanone was affected by an overall lower activation free energy values; i.e., 22 and 19.6 kcal/mol (Scheme 9), for the formation of the R and S products, respectively, to be compared with the corresponding values of 29.1 and 22.1 kcal/mol (Scheme 8), for the reaction of 2-pentanone. This data was in agreement with the two-fold higher turnover frequency of the 4-phenyl-2-butanone reported by Fish et al. [2a,3c] and was related, as indicated by our DFT calculations, to the higher rate in the hydride transfer step. Interestingly, the stability of the η2-5,6-Zn(II) complex with the biomimetic co-factor, 4, seemed to also play a major role in determining the overall free energy barrier of the C-to-C hydride transfer. Both the Zn-C5 and Zn-C6 bond distances were affected by the different orientations of the ketone substrate, either pro- R or pro- S . Moreover, DFT models showed that the Zn-C5 distances in the S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes with 4, formed with either 2-pentanone or 4-phenyl-2-butanol, were slightly shorter by approximately 0.03 Å, as compared to the corresponding R-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes of 4 (Fig. 9 ). The C4-H⋅⋅⋅⋅C=O distances in the R/S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes of 4 with 4-phenyl-2-butanone were also similarly affected by the orientation of the ketone substrate, being approximately 0.06 Å shorter in the S configuration than the R configuration. The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of the η2-Zn(II) complexes with 4, formed with both 2-pentanone and 4-phenyl-2-butanone showed, in detail, that the orbital interactions underlying the donation involved the C5=C6 double bond (donor) of 4 and the Zn(II) metal ion. [14] As expected, the most intense orbital interactions demonstrated π → 4s and π → 4p character, with donation of the co-factors' 5,6 π bond to the Zn(II) metal ion center. Interactions with σ → 4p character were also found to involve the donation from either the C5-C6, C5-H, or C6-H σ bonds, but to a lesser extent. The second order perturbation analysis (SOP) allowed us to estimate the energy of these interactions, and thus the determination of the strength of the η2-5,6-Zn(II) coordination, with 4, in the R5,6 and S5,6 structures formed with 2-pentanone and 4-phenyl-2-butanone. As shown in Table 3 , the SOP parameters were inversely correlated to the η2-5,6-Zn(II) complex with 4's free energy, thus providing an increase in the η2-coordination that induced more stabilization. The conformational parameters of the R / S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes with 4 appeared to be very critical, and indeed, when the bulkier groups of the ketone substrate, either phenethyl or propyl, were placed side by side with the Zn(II) metal ion center, the R-η2-5,6-Zn(II) structures, with co-factor 4, showed that this coordination was slightly destabilized. This steric effect might also determine the higher stability of the η2-5,6-4-Zn(II) complexes formed with the η1 bound 4-phenyl-2-butanone compared to those for the η1 bound 2-pentanone; in this case, we detected the C4-H⋅⋅⋅⋅C=O distances of 2.84 and 2.78 Å, in the R / S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes of 4 with 4-phenyl-2-butanone, respectively, and slightly shorter than 2.87 and 2.89 Å in the same complexes of 2-pentanone."
6,Discussion,"The DFT mechanism studies, on tandem catalysis, including the chemoselective co-factor regeneration of biomimetic 1,4-NADH compounds, utilizing the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ complex, and the enantioselective reduction of achiral ketones by a core model of the 1,4-NADH-dependent HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme, were fully investigated. The description of the chemical processes gained by the use of quantum mechanical methods provided data on the structural basis of the chemo and enantioselectivity shown by these two tandem catalytic reactions. The [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, complex B (Scheme 1), can be considered a biomimetic hydrogenase system, which was able to chemoselectively reduce either biomimetic or natural NAD+ co-factors, 1-3, respectively (Fig. 1), in the presence of Na formate as the hydride source, to their respective 1,4-NADH co-factor analogues. [3d] Although a general agreement was found in the recent literature concerning the mechanism of formation of the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ catalyst itself, via the reaction of the catalytic precursor [Cp*Rh(bpy)H2O]2+ with Na formate, [15] we have focused rather on two alternative mechanistic schemes that have been postulated for the chemoselective transfer of hydride to the biomimetic NAD+ co-factors, 1 and 2. In one mechanistic pathway (Scheme 1, postulate I), the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H],+ complex B, was postulated to coordinate to the 3-amide carbonyl oxygen atom, in a six membered ring TS#, of the NAD+ biomimetic co-factors, 1 and 2, and correspondingly, underwent a Cp*RhH-to-C4 hydride transfer yielding the chemoselective 1,4-NADH co-factors, 4 and 5 [2a,3c]. In an alternative pathway (Scheme 1, postulate II), it was clearly shown that [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ undergoes a tautomeric equilibrium to a [(η4-Cp*H)Rh(I)]+ complex that was then postulated to provide the CH-to-C4 hydride transfer to afford the natural 1,4-dihydronicotinamide co-factor, with similar 3-amide carbonyl binding, as shown in Scheme 1 , postulate I. [9, 10]. DFT calculations provided the identity of the intermediates and transition states, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetics of the catalytic reactions, while these results were found to be very different than the two mechanistic hypotheses shown in Scheme 1. The tautomeric equilibrium of the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ intermediate, B, to the [(η4-Cp*H)Rh(bpy)]+ complex, B' (Scheme 1, postulate II), reported by Miller et al. [10] was confirmed by our own DFT calculations proving that complex B was in equilibrium with B', via a moderately fast activation free energy of 16 kcal/mol, for an intramolecular reductive elimination, Cp*RhH-to-Cp* hydride transfer, and a calculated B:B' ratio of 1:12 in aqueous solution. More importantly, our calculations clearly demonstrated that the further reaction of B' with the NAD+ substrate via C-to-C hydride transfer to afford the 1,4-NADH co-factor was strongly affected by an activation free energy of more than 30 kcal/mol, while the Cp*RhH-to-C hydride transfer occurred, via the non-covalent interactions between B and the biomimetic cofactor, 1, was thought to be a more favorable activation free energy of only 10 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the speculated (Cp*H)Rh(I) binding to the similar 3-amide carbonyl, in Scheme 1, postulate II, was further affected by the high electron density of the Rh(I) metal ion center, which would possibly eliminate this intermediate coordination step. The role played by the Cp*Rh(III) metal ion center, in determining the chemoselectivity in the hydride transfer on C4 of the NAD+ co-factor, was another aspect that was clarified by our DFT investigation. Indeed, we found that the O-coordination of the biomimetic cofactor, 1, at the metal ion center of the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ intermediate, B, as suggested by previous experimental evidence, was thermodynamically unfavorable [2a,3c]. The detailed analysis of the electronic structure of [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+, B, even showed that there were empty orbitals on Rh(III) amenable to form coordinative bonds with electron-donor groups; however, they were orbital combinations, which would invariably lead to partial decomplexation of either Cp* or the bpy ligand (Fig. 3). Conversely, we found that non-covalent interactions between the biomimetic NAD+ co-factor, 1, and [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ (Scheme 2, Fig. 4, C2) were formed via weak, non-covalent, polar effects, involving the carbonyl oxygen of the cofactor's 3-amide group and methyl C–H bonds on the Cp* ligand, as well as, the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ with the C4H of the co-factor (Fig. 5, ts3). Although these non-covalent interactions were found to be weak, and may not fully effect the formation of C2, ts3, or D2, they do provide a steric influence to the orientation of [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ with the biomimetic NAD+ co-factor, 1, in analogy with the contours of the HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme site of catalytic activity. Thus, the orientation of co-factor 1 was poised to receive the hydride from [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ on C4, and was the suggested basis for the observed chemoselectivity. The same weak interactions detected in C2 were not only consistent, but were even strengthened by those evolving in the structures of either the transition state, ts3, or the product adduct, D2 (Figs. 5 and 6). The formation of non-covalent interactions between [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ and the NAD+ co-factor, 1, were further proven by the previous experimental data. Indeed, the activation entropy for the reduction of 1 was found to be slightly negative in the 1:1 mixture of THF:H2O, while being positive by more than 20 eu in the aqueous buffer. [3d] We also recognized that the π-stacking between the nicotinamide ring of co-factor 1 and the bpy ligand detected in either the C2, D2, or ts3 structures may produce a hydrophobic effect responsible for an increase in the solvent entropy. Such an effect was strongly manifested in a purely aqueous solvent, where it can consequently overcome the translational entropy, and provide an increase in the formation of C2, while also explaining the positive activation entropy in pure water versus the negative activation entropy in the THF:H2O mixture. [3d] The reactivity of the NAD+ biomimetic co-factors bearing different substitution, at either the C3 or N1 position of the nicotinamide nucleus, was then investigated concerning the calculations of the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ hydride transfer steps for both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. Our calculations indicated that by replacing the 3-amide group of co-factor 1 with either a 3-CH3 or 3-CN group induced a slight increase or decrease, respectively, in the activation free energy of the hydride transfer step, whereas these substituents determined a more effective increase or decrease, with the same order, of the overall reaction free energy (Scheme 4). We assumed that the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ hydride transfer step led to the formation of a product adduct, such as D2 (Fig. 6), in the case of the biomimetic NAD+ co-factor 1, then subsequently reacted with Na formate to regenerate the precatalytic complex, Cp*RhO(C=O)H, A (Scheme 1). Thus, while an adequate turnover frequency was ensured by the marked exergodicity disclosed by either 1 or its 3-CN analogue, 8, the 3-CH3 co-factor, 9, was only in equilibrium with its reduced form (reaction free energy of –0.9 kcal/mol), while its concentration would probably be inadequate to provide the catalytic regeneration cycle. The substitution of the N1 group with either the N-CH3, 7, or the N-ribose-5′-methyl phosphate group of co-factor, 2, also induced a modulation of the hydride transfer rate, although at a lesser extent compared to the effect of the C3 substituents. The analysis of the activation free energy in terms of electronic, solvation, and thermal/entropy contributions showed how, in all cases, the solvation contribution compensated the positive electronic energy, so that the estimated activation free energy was mainly determined by the positive thermal contribution, mostly due to the loss of one translational degree of freedom (Table 1). The trend of reactivity, with the N-benzyl group for biomimetic co-factors, 1, 8 (3-CN), 9 (3-CH3), N-CH3, 7, and the N-ribose-5′-methyl phosphate group, 2: 1 > 7 > 8 > 2 > 9, was fully consistent with the available experimental data, [3d] which qualitatively correlated with the electron withdrawing effect of the nicotinamide ring; biomimetic cofactor 9 bearing a methyl group on C3 was found to be unreactive. Alternatively, the concurrence of two electron-withdrawing groups, such as the C3 amide and the N-benzyl group on cofactor 1, evidently induced a higher reactivity. Therefore, the substituent effect on the nicotinamide ring should be interpreted in terms of the stabilization of the electron density carried by the incoming hydride ion in the transition state structure, such that electron-withdrawing groups enhanced the NAD+ co-factor's reactivity. The 1,4-NADH dependent HLADH-Zn(II) catalysis for reduction of achiral ketones to chiral S-alcohols, which operated in tandem with the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ catalysis of the reduction of NAD+ biomimetic co-factors to their 1,4-NADH co-factors, was also investigated by means of DFT calculations. In particular, we were interested in the possible participation of the Zn(II) in the HLADH catalysis, by assuming the direct involvement of the Zn(II) metal ion center in the cofactor-to-substrate hydride transfer. Thus, an alternative mechanistic postulate was invoked in the formation of a Zn(I)H intermediate, which was recently postulated by Fish et al. [3c] (Scheme 5, Mechanism I). DFT calculations were then performed on the core model of the HLADH metal ion, Zn(II), to assess the thermodynamic and kinetic viability of the proposed catalytic routes, and eventually, the underlying structural aspects of this catalytic system. A preliminary thermodynamic assessment showed that the formation of a postulated HLADH-Zn(I)H complex, in the ketone-to-alcohol synthetic route, was affected by high enthalpy costs that could be partially compensated by a translational entropy increase. This was caused by the simultaneous decomplexation of another Zn(II) bound ligand, where calculations indicated that the decomplexation of the imidazole ligand occurred at a lower energy cost compared to the thiolate ligand (Table 2). In the natural HLADH enzyme system, where the decomplexation of either the His or Cys ligands from the Zn(II) coordination would not produce a translational entropy increase, rather the decomplexation may locally increase the HLADH structural flexibility, with an increase in conformational entropy. These considerations prompted us to investigate the imidazole decomplexation, which was found to define the lowest enthalpy and free energy cost, as a viable mechanistic route in the HLADH catalysis, and led us to focus on the kinetics of the reduction of 2-pentanone with the Zn(SCH3)2(Imidazole) HLADH complex, in the presence of the biomimetic cofactor 4. The latter system represented a core model of the HLADH-substrate-cofactor ternary complex. Therefore, two starting configurations obtained by the rotation of ketone scaffold around the Zn-O=CR'/R coordinating bond gave rise to either the R and S ternary complexes, which were taken into account to assess the enantioselectivity for the R or the S-2-pentanol products (Scheme 6). Surprisingly, our DFT calculations showed that the gradual decomplexation of the imidazole ligand from the ternary complex, which was the upstream step in the reaction channel leading to the postulated ZnH complex, occurred with energy costs of only 16 and 10 kcal/mol for the R and S complex, respectively (Fig. 7). These low energy costs could also be related to the parallel proposal of a η2-Zn(II) coordination with co-factor 4, with either the 2,3 or 5,6 double bonds of 1,4-NADH biomimic co-factor, 4, that compensated the coordinative vacancy caused by the imidazole decomplexation. Moreover, this type of η2-Zn coordination, to a double bond, has been shown to be a rare event; however, Walsh et al. have provided unequivocal proof for these types of η2-Zn(II)-olefin complexes utilizing divinyl ligands, via X-ray crystallography studies. [16] This was critical added proof for our proposed HLADH-η2−Zn(II) core model complex with the 1,4-NADH biomimetic co-factor, 4, as an intermediate in the enantioselective hydride transfer to a η1-Zn(II) bound 2-pentanone or 4-phenyl-2-butanone, to provide the S-alcohol enantiomer. The DFT calculated structures of the η2-2,3-Zn(II) and η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes of co-factor 4 (Fig. 8) displayed different arrangements of the molecular scaffolds that provided two alternative mechanistic channels. Thus, both the R-η2-2,3-Zn(II) and S-η2-2,3-Zn(II) complexes were characterized by a close proximity of the C4–H bond of cofactor 4 to the Zn(II) metal ion center, and in the configuration amenable for the C4-H-to-Zn hydride transfer (Scheme 5, Mechanism I). Alternatively, both R-η2-5,6-Zn(II) and S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes presented shorter distances between the incipient C4-H hydride of co-factor 4 and the ketone C=O carbon, thus providing a direct co-factor-to-substrate hydride transfer (Scheme 5, Mechanism II), with the caveat, of no Zn(II) coordination to the 1,4-NADH co-factor was ever reported concerning this mechanism, to our knowledge. These DFT calculations provided an assessment of the viability of both mechanistic hypotheses, via the reconstruction of the corresponding free energy profiles. Therefore, Mechanism I, postulating a C4-H-to-Zn(II) hydride transfer, which occurred in both the R-η2-2,3-Zn(II) and S-η2-2,3-Zn(II) complexes, was found to be affected by free energy barriers of 37.2 and 34 kcal/mol, respectively, clearly indicating that this route was not kinetically viable (Scheme 7 ). The direct cofactor-to-substrate hydride transfer occurring on either R-η2-5,6-Zn(II) and S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes were both affected by the activation free energy values of < 30 kcal/mol, and provided evidence that the formation of R / S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes were probably the only energy barrier encountered with the postulated Mechanism II (Schemes 8 and 9). The intramolecular C4-H-to-C=O hydride transfer in the S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complex, with co-factor 4, provided the chiral S-2-pentanol and S-4-phenyl-2-butanol, with the concomitant release of co-factor 1 from the Zn(II) metal ion center. Conversely, the inverse process, the conversion of a Zn(II)-alkoxide complex into the Zn(II)-coordinated ketone, via the 1 → 4 conversion, was initiated by plausible non-covalent interactions between 1 and the core S-2-pentanol-HLADH-Zn(II) complex, [(CH3S)2ZnO(H)C*H(CH3)CH2CH2CH3]. Therefore, with the reductive HLADH-catalyzed reactions, the hydride transfer was controlled by the Zn(II) coordination of both substrate and 1,4-NADH co-factor, while the oxidative process was mainly affected by the co-factor-substrate approach, as was expected, and mainly driven by the HLADH residual peptide-co-factor interactions, as shown in a DFT study by Hammes-Schiffer et al. [17] The enantioselectivity for the formation of S-alcohols was a crucial aspect emerging in our computational study. Indeed, the stereospecificity manifested in the majority of enzymatic reactions has been commonly attributed to the protein environment that provided for a tight steric control at the enzymatic site of reactivity. Moreover, the conformation of the substrates provided a chiral environment, which also was formed by the surrounding L-amino acids. Importantly, we have computationally detected almost the same degree of enantioselectivity for the formation of the S-2-pentanol or S-4-phenyl-2-butanol, in the absence of the HLADH protein environment. Thus, a ΔΔG of 7 kcal/mol obtained by the difference between the overall activation free energy values of 29.1 and 22.1 kcal/mol for the formation of R and S-2-pentanol, respectively, suggested that a significant amount of enantioselectivity in the HLADH catalysis was determined by the η2-Zn(II) coordination. Both the R/S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes, and the subsequent transition state structures, were characterized by several stereogenic centers. For example, the two carbon atoms of the 5,6 double bond of biomimetic co-factor, 4, that were involved in the η2-coordination, as well as the Zn(II) metal ion center, were in chiral environments (Fig. 8). To further corroborate our computational data, DFT calculations were also performed to investigate the enantioselective reduction of 4-phenyl-2-butanone, within our newly constructed mechanistic II postulate. As expected, the calculated structures of either the R/S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) intermediates, and subsequent hydride transfer transition states, that closely resemble the corresponding structures formed by the 4-phenyl-2-butanone (Fig. 9), also was shown to have the same higher stabilization of the S over the R enantiomers. More interestingly, DFT calculations also provided a slightly higher stabilization of the S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complex with 4-phenyl-2-butanone that eventually contributed to a slight decrease in the overall activation free energy for the 1,4-NADH co-factor, 4, in the C4-H-to-ketone hydride transfer (Scheme 9). The steric interactions between 4-phenyl-2-butanone and 2-pentanone, and the other molecular scaffold, seemed to play a surprisingly important role in tuning the stability of the S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes, and their conformational structures. Indeed, the strength of the η2 coordination, estimated by means of an NBO analysis, increased when the bulkiest group bonded to the ketone carbonyl, either propyl or phenethyl, for the S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complexes formed with the η1-Zn(II) bound 2-pentanone or 4-phenyl-2-butanone, respectively. These more stable configurations were found to be on the same linear plane, as the core model of the HLADH-Zn(II) metal ion center (Figs. 8 and 9). Thus, with these overall high level DFT calculations, we can now redraw the proposed tandem catalytic cycles for both the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ catalysis in the reduction of NAD+ biomimetic co-factors, 1 and 2, to their 1,4-NADH co-factors, 4 and 5, as well as, the subsequent (HLADH)-η1-ketone-η2-5,6-cofactor, 4,-Zn(II) complex, in the enantioselective C4-H hydride transfer to the ketone carbonyl carbon, to produce the chiral S-alcohols (Scheme 10 ). Finally, it was apparent that we also needed, in a future high level DFT study, to address the more difficult analysis of the natural 1,4-NADH co-factor mechanism with the natural HLADH-Zn(II) catalysis cycle and surrounding peptide residues. This study could ascertain whether our core model of the HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme utilized for our DFT studies has validity in the natural enzyme for the production of chiral S-alcohols by the bioreduction of achiral ketone substrates. In our view, the results published previously using the biomimetic 1, 4 NADH co-factors, 4 and 5, provided very similar results with the natural 1,4-NADH co-factor [2a,3c]. Therefore, we tentatively assume that the formation of the enantioselective S-η2-5,6-Zn(II) complex with the natural 1,4-NADH co-factor, 6, for S-alcohol biosynthesis, could also be a viable pathway for the natural, 1,4-NADH dependent HLADH-Zn(II) enzyme. This includes stabilization of the proton and hydride transfers, via the peptide residues surrounding the HLADH-Zn(II) metal ion center, which was described in a DFT computational study by Hammes-Schiffer et al., for LADH, in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, with natural NAD+.

7,Experimental Section,
8,Theoretical Calculations,"4.1 Theoretical Calculations 4.1.1 Cp*Rh(III) and Cp*Rh(I) Complexes All the calculations were performed by using the Gaussian 09 package [18]. The local minimum geometries were calculated with the M06L functional, [19,20] and the LANL2DZ valence shell basis set based on double-ζ plus one l+1 polarization to describe the valence shell electrons, and a pseudopotential accounting for the relativistic effects affecting the core electrons of Rh; [21–24] this scheme was denoted with the sbs (small basis set). The conductor-like screening model implemented in Gaussian 09 (CPCM) [25] was used in the calculations to simulate the effect of bulk water (with default settings for water). CPCM was then employed in the localization of transition states and intermediates in the reactions of the Cp*Rh complexes. The use of CPCM/M06L/sbs level of theory for the geometrical optimization of the Cp*Rh(III) complexes was validated by a small benchmark of selected functionals based on their capability to reproduce the geometry of the X-ray structure of the [Cp*Rh(bpy)H2O]2+ complex (Table S1). [3d] Vibrational frequencies analyses were performed at the same level of theory to confirm the correct nature of all optimized stationary points and calculate zero-point energy and thermal corrections (under the hypothesis of an ideal gas behavior) for enthalpy and free energy estimates. The electronic energy of each CPCM/M06L/sbs geometry was recalculated by using a larger basis set scheme: i) the all-electron triple-ζ 6-311G+(d,p) basis set including one l+1 polarization plus one s diffusion function for S, C, N, O, and H, [26-28]; ii) the analogous 6-311G+(3d) basis set for Cl; [29,30] iii) The Rh core electrons were described again through the LANL2 pseudo-potential, [21-24] while for the valence shell we used a fully uncontracted (5s, 5p, 3d) Gaussian basis set (corresponding to the Hay-Wadt basis set, [22,23] with no contraction) plus an f polarization function with an exponent coefficient of 1.35. We further denote this basis set scheme with lbs (large basis set). For each species X, the free energy in water solution at 298 K ( G x 0 ( s o l ) ) was computed as: ( G x 0 ( s o l ) ) = E x l b s ( s o l ) + G x , c o r r s b s , where, E x l b s ( s o l ) , was the sum of the electronic energy, E x l b s ( g a s ) , calculated at M06L/lbs//CPCM/M06L/sbs level of theory with the solvation free energy, Δ G x s o l v , and G x , c o r r s b s , was a correction term comprising the zero-point energy, the enthalpy and entropy corrections, and the further correction of +1.9 kcal/mol to account for the gas→sol reference state change. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed to check the correct interconnection of each ts point to the expected RA and PA species. The same computational scheme was also employed to investigate the hydride transfer reaction from [Cp*Rh(bpy)H]+ to the biomimetic cofactor 3 (vide infra), even though, due to the large size of this system, a two-layered M06L:PM6 ONIOM scheme, was used instead, for either geometry optimization/frequency analyses (sbs) or electronic energy calculation (lbs) [31,32]. 4.1.2 Zn(II) Complexes Calculations on the Zn(II) complexes were performed by using the Gaussian 09 package, [18] and almost the same density functional approach described in the previous section. Indeed, the M06L exchange-correlation functional has been reported to be outperforming in the prediction of either geometry or electronic structure of Zn(II) complexes with protein-based ligands. [33] The same basis set scheme employed for the Cp*Rh complexes was used in both geometry optimization and electronic energy calculations. The most important difference was represented by the calculations of solvation effects, again by using the CPCM scheme implemented in the Gaussian 09 software (see section above), on the gas phase optimized geometries. Thus, for each species X, the enthalpy/free energy in water solution at 298 K ( H x 0 ( s o l ) / G x 0 ( s o l ) ) was computed as: H x 0 ( s o l ) / G x 0 ( s o l ) = E x l b s ( s o l ) + H x , c o r r s b s / G x , c o r r s b s , where, E x l b s ( s o l ) was the electronic energy calculated at CPCM/M06L/lbs//M06L/sbs level of theory, and H x , c o r r s b s / G x , c o r r s b s was a correction term comprising the zero-point energy, and the enthalpy/free energy correction. The energy barrier for the imidazole decomplexation from the Zn(II) center of the ternary complex (vide infra) was estimated by the use of a relaxed scan."
