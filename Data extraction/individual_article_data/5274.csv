0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a potentially very attractive source of energy since its combustion produces only water and energy. The conventional methods of hydrogen production are based on gasoline or natural gas reforming. Among the different feedstocks available, alcohols are very promising candidates because these are easily decomposed in the presence of water and generate hydrogen-rich mixture at a relatively lower temperature. Steam reforming (SR) of methanol has been extensively studied in recent years [1–7]. The main drawback is its relatively high toxicity. SR of ethanol for the production of hydrogen is very attractive among the various processes proposed, because ethanol is abundantly available from biomass, is easy to store and is nontoxic. Moreover, ethanol is CO 2 neutral since the amount of CO 2 produced by SR is consumed by the biomass growth, and this offers a nearly closed carbon loop [8]. The stoichiometry of the reaction for maximum hydrogen production is given by (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 6 H 2 + 2 CO 2 . The catalytic performance of supported noble metal catalysts (Rh, Ru, Pt, Pd) for the SR of ethanol has been investigated by Liguras et al. [9] in the temperature range of 600–850 ∘ C. They studied the effect of the nature of the support (Al 2 O 3 , MgO, TiO 2 ) and the metal loading (0–5%) on the reforming reactions. For low-loaded catalysts, compared to Ru, Pt and Pd, Rh was found to be significantly more active and selective towards hydrogen. The effect of Co catalyst with different metal oxide supports has been examined by Llorca et al. [10]. They prepared catalyst containing 1wt% Co on different supports ( γ -Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , TiO 2 , V 2 O 5 , ZnO, La 2 O 3 , CeO 2 and Sm 2 O 3 ) . Among all catalysts studied, Co/ZnO catalyst exhibited comparatively better performance (conversion: 100%, selectivity up to 73.8% to H 2 and 24.2% to CO 2 was obtained at 723K), but at this temperature lower yield of H 2 (5.1mol/mol of EtOH reacted) compared to theoretical value (6mol/mol of ethanol reacted) was obtained. On the other hand, over the catalyst the decomposition of ethanol to acetone was high. Many side products such as C 2 H 4 , C 3 H 6 , and CH 3 CHO were obtained. Therefore, at the reaction temperature, reforming reaction was low and dehydration reaction was prominent. Frusteri et al. [11,12] studied SR of ethanol on undoped and doped Ni/MgO catalysts. The dopants used were Li, Na or K. At 650 ∘ C, the Ni/MgO catalyst was stable for 700h time-on-stream and showed very high selectivity to H 2 and CO 2 . This catalyst showed low tendency to promote CO methanation and ethanol decomposition reaction. In addition, the coke formation was strongly depressed in the presence of basic carrier MgO. Li and Na promoted the NiO reduction but negatively affected the dispersion of Ni/MgO catalyst, whereas K did not significantly affect either the morphology or the dispersion. Li and K enhanced the stability of Ni/MgO mainly by depressing Ni sintering. A wide range of catalysts were tested by Aupretre et al. [13] by changing both the active phase (Rh, Pt, Pd, Ru, Ni, Cu, Zn, Fe) and the oxide support (Al 2 O 3 , 12% CeO 2 –Al 2 O 3 , CeO 2 ,CeO 2 –ZrO 2 , ZrO 2 ) . At 700 ∘ C and atmospheric pressure, γ -Al 2 O 3 supported Rh and Ni gave the best performance compared to Pt, Cu, Zn or Fe. For Rh catalysts, 1% Rh/ γ -Al 2 O 3 showed the highest selectivity (88%) while 1% Rh/CeO 2 –ZrO 2 exhibited the highest yield of hydrogen. Similar results were obtained for Ni catalysts. They reported that activity in the SR reaction directly varies as degree of mobility of surface OH groups, and selectivity towards CO 2 is controlled by the activity in the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction. The ceria-based supports were highly active for the WGS reaction. Recently, Zhang et al. [14] studied ceria-supported Co, Ir and Ni catalyst for SR of ethanol for hydrogen production. All the catalysts were active and selective for hydrogen production. Ir/CeO 2 catalyst was the most stable and did not show any appreciable deactivation for 300h time-on-stream. This was attributed to the high dispersion of Ir due to the strong interaction with the CeO 2 , thereby reducing the sintering of the catalyst. Pereira et al. [15] proposed a bi-functional mechanism for alkylated aromatics selective reforming reaction, where the water is activated on the support as hydroxyl groups and the hydrocarbon to be reformed is activated on the metal particle. According to this mechanism, oxide supports with high surface mobility of hydroxyl groups would favor the SR reaction. The thermodynamic analysis of the water ethanol reaction shows that at high water concentration, SR of ethanol is favored. An increase in the amount of water also has the effect of increasing the extent of the WGS and methane SR reactions, which reduces the amount of the undesired products, CO and CH 4 [16]. A water to ethanol feed ratio greater than 3 is necessary in order to obtain hydrogen and prevent carbon formation [17,18]. Too high a water to ethanol ratio increases the energy required for vaporization of water. In this study, SR of ethanol over Ni/CeO 2 –ZrO 2 catalyst has been investigated at a ethanol to water ratio of 1:8. The main objective was to study the effect of support composition as well as metal loading on SR reaction and product distribution."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The CeO 2 , ZrO 2 and Ce 1 - x Zr x O 2 mixed oxide supports were prepared by co-precipitation with ammonia using aqueous solution of cerium nitrate and zirconium oxychloride. The weight ratio of CeO 2 / ZrO 2 was 4, 1 and 0.25 which corresponds to x of 0.26, 0.59 and 0.84, respectively. Aqueous ammonia solution was added dropwise to the aqueous solution containing the Ce and Zr salt at the desired concentration with constant stirring until pH was 9–10. After precipitation, the obtained hydroxide was filtered, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and then dried at 120 ∘ C for 12h. The obtained solid was calcined in air at 750 ∘ C for 5h. The resulting solid oxides were crushed and sieved to a size 50–70 mesh before metal impregnation. Ni loading was carried out by incipient wetness impregnation method. The Ni loading was varied from 10 to 40wt%. After impregnation, the catalyst was dried at 120 ∘ C for 12h and then calcined at 500 ∘ C for 5h."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts The specific surface area of catalysts was determined by the dynamic pulsing technique on a Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2705 instrument, employing nitrogen physio-sorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. Prior to each measurement, the sample was degassed at 120 ∘ C by passing helium for 20min. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed in order to identify the different phases present in the catalyst and to determine their crystallinity. The spectra were obtained with a Siemmens diffractometer (Model D500) using Cu K α radiation, Ni filter and 40kV, at a two theta interval of 20–100 ∘ with a sweep of 3 ∘ /min and a time constant of 3s. The average crystallite size of CeO 2 and ZrO 2 was determined using the Scherrer equation [19] from the line widths of the XRD peaks corresponding to (111), (220) and (311) crystal planes, and the average crystal size of NiO was determined from the line width of the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes, respectively. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was performed to determine the reduction behavior of CeO 2 , ZrO 2 , Ce 1 - x Zr x O 2 and the Ni species on the support. The experiments were performed on the Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2705 equipment, using 25mg of catalyst and a temperature ramp from 35 to 1000 ∘ C at 10 ∘ C/min. A flow rate of 40cm 3 /min of 5% H 2 in argon was used for the reduction. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was employed to determine the amount of hydrogen consumed. The nickel surface area was determined by hydrogen pulse chemisorption on the Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2705 unit. For these measurements, approximately 100mg of catalyst was used. The catalyst was reduced at 700 ∘ C using pure H 2 for 3h and then the sample was purged by passing argon at 700 ∘ C for 1h. The catalyst was cooled to 50 ∘ C in flowing argon. The hydrogen pulse chemisorption study was done using pure H 2 , the pulse was given after 3–5min interval until the area of successive hydrogen peaks were identical."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing Experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure in a continuous fixed bed downflow vertical tubular reactor consisting of a quartz tube, 400mm in length and 10mm i.d. Another quartz tube of 300mm length and 5mm i.d attached to the first one served as the outlet to facilitate fast removal of reactor effluent. A schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . The catalyst was placed on a quartz wool bed inside the reactor. Hundred milligrams of catalyst (size: 50–80 mesh) diluted with 150mg of same sized quartz particles was used for catalytic tests. Prior to a run, the catalyst was reduced in situ at 700 ∘ C for 1h under a hydrogen flow rate of 20 cm 3 / min . Water/ethanol mixture (EtOH/H 2 O = 1:8mol/mol) premixed in a separate container, vaporized at 150 ∘ C was fed to the reactor by a pump (Model RP-G6; FMI, USA). Nitrogen, which served as an inert, was mixed with the vaporized feed, and the mixture was then fed to the reactor. The flow rate of nitrogen was controlled by a mass flow controller. The nitrogen flow rate was maintained at 50 cm 3 / min and the liquid flow rate was maintained at 0.08ml/min. The reaction temperature was varied from 400 to 650 ∘ C. The product stream was analyzed by use of three gas chromatographs (Nucon). The first one, equipped with a packed column (Hysep) and a flame ionization detector (FID) with N 2 as the carrier gas, was used for the separation of CO, CH 4 , CO 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 5 OH, CH 3 CHO and CH 3 COCH 3 . The second GC, equipped with a Molecular Sieve 5A column and TCD with Ar as the carrier gas, was used for the determination of H 2 . The third GC was used to analyze the composition of condensed liquid products on a capillary column (Petrocol DH capillary column) using FID with N 2 as the carrier gas. For calculating the selectivity of the gaseous products, nitrogen was used as the internal standard. For the liquid products, isopropanol was used as the internal standard."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The surface areas and crystallite size of CeO 2 –ZrO 2 and NiO are shown in Table 1 . The surface areas of the supports were in the range of 10.1–31.1m 2 /g and decreased after nickel impregnation. These surface areas are comparable to those reported by Laosiripojana and Assabumrungrat [20] for ceria–zirconia supported nickel catalysts. All the CeO 2 –ZrO 2 samples showed specific surface area higher than CeO 2 . Introduction of ZrO 2 into the ceria lattice significantly enhanced the surface area of the mixed oxide. These results are in agreement with those of Masui et al. [21], who reported that the surface area of CeO 2 –ZrO 2 supports increased with zirconium content until Ce fraction became 20mol%. This may be caused by a change in the crystal structure of the Ce–Zr system. Trovarelli et al. [22] reported that for higher Ce ( > 80%mol) containing system the cubic phase is favored, whereas for ZrO 2 -rich solid solutions the monoclinic phases were observed. For intermediate composition, both cubic phases and tetragonal phases were detected. The XRD patterns of Ce 1 - x Zr x O 2 supports are shown in Fig. 2 . The XRD patterns of pure CeO 2 showed a number of peaks corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (422) crystal planes, which can be assigned to a typical cubic fluorite structure [23]. However, with addition of ZrO 2 , the peak intensities reduced and the peaks broadened. Diffraction peaks of ZrO 2 were not observed up to a ZrO 2 content of 59%, which suggested the incorporation of ZrO 2 into CeO 2 lattice to form a solid solution. Due to shrinkage of lattice structure with the replacement of cerium cation by zirconium cation, the diffraction peaks shifted to higher theta values with increase in ZrO 2 content. When Zr content increased to 84%, the peaks due to the crystal plane of ZrO 2 were clearly observed (Fig. 2). The XRD patterns of the different CeO 2 –ZrO 2 supports impregnated with 30% Ni are shown in Fig. 3 . The 30% Ni/CeO 2 catalyst showed the characteristic peaks corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) crystal planes. The NiO peaks were very sharp indicating that NiO was not well dispersed on CeO 2 . On the other hand, the 30% Ni/ZrO 2 catalyst showed all characteristic peaks corresponding to reported tetragonal structure of ZrO 2 [24]. In the case of 30% Ni/Ce 1 - x Zr x O 2 ( x = 0.26 , 0.59, 0.84) catalysts, XRD patterns showed all peaks corresponding to cubic-fluorite structure of NiO–CeO 2 –ZrO 2 solid solution. For the NiO-CeO 2 –ZrO 2 catalysts, intensity of the peaks corresponding to NiO is low and broad compared to 30% Ni/CeO 2 , indicating the good dispersion of NiO crystallite in Ce 1 - x Zr x O 2 solid oxide supports. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 catalysts with different Ni loadings. The peaks corresponding to NiO intensified with an increase in nickel loading, suggesting that at low Ni loading, NiO was present in the form of small particles while at higher Ni content, NiO agglomeration took place at the bulk. At higher Ni loading ( ⩾ 30wt%) three new peaks at about 46 ∘ , 55 ∘ and 65 ∘ were observed due to bulk agglomerated phase of NiO [25]. The dimensions of CeO 2 –ZrO 2 crystallites were in the range 10.9–26.0nm (Table 1), whereas the NiO crystallites were in the range of 13.3–17.9nm. The reduction features of the support as well as catalyst were analyzed by TPR study. The TPR plots of pure CeO 2 , ZrO 2 and Ce 1 - x Zr x O 2 ( x = 0.26 , 0.59, 0.84) catalyst are shown in Fig. 5 . The reduction profile of pure CeO 2 is characterized by two peaks; a low-temperature peak at a temperature of 503 ∘ C which is generally attributed to the reduction of the surface layer of CeO 2 and another peak at a higher temperature of 752 ∘ C, which is due to the reduction of the material in the bulk [22]. Pure ZrO 2 did not show any reduction peak in this wide range of temperature, in agreement with reported results [26]. Comparing the TPR profiles of Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 and CeO 2 , it can be seen that for Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 , intensity of the lower temperature peak increased whereas intensity of the peak at higher temperature reduced drastically. For Ce 0.41 Zr 0.59 O 2 and Ce 0.16 Zr 0.84 O 2 , the reduction peak at higher temperature was not present, indicating that with increasing ZrO 2 content, CeO 2 was dispersed thoroughly, facilitating the total reduction of cerium oxide at a lower temperature. With increasing ZrO 2 content, the reduction temperature of Ce 1 - x Zr x O 2 supports shifted towards higher temperature, suggesting that the interaction between CeO 2 and ZrO 2 increased presumably due to the formation of a solid solution. The TPR data was used to evaluate the reactivity of lattice oxygen towards hydrogen in ceria–zirconia supports. Since ZrO 2 did not show any reduction peak, it was assumed that all the consumed hydrogen contributes to the reduction of CeO 2 . The degree of reduction of lattice oxygen is shown in Table 2 . For pure CeO 2 , 10.8% of the lattice oxygen was consumed. With incorporation of 20wt% ZrO 2 to CeO 2 (Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 ) , there was only a marginal change in the degree of reduction of lattice oxygen, but, in contrast to pure CeO 2 , the predominant contribution was from the hydrogen consumption at the lower temperature (514 ∘ C). For Ce 0.41 Zr 0.59 O 2 and Ce 0.16 Zr 0.84 O 2 , the degree of reduction of lattice oxygen increased to 29.2% and 57.0%, respectively. This shows that with increasing ZrO 2 content, the reduction of bulk oxygen in ceria–zirconia is easier. The results of TPR of 30% Ni/Ce 1 - x Zr x O 2 ( x = 0 , 0.26, 0.59, 0.84, 1) catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . For the 30% Ni/CeO 2 catalyst, a sharp peak at 350 ∘ C and another low broad peak at 736 ∘ C was obtained. The first peak is associated with the reduction of NiO to Ni 0 , and the peak at 760 ∘ C is related to the partial reduction of Ce 4 + to Ce 3 + [27]. The peak obtained at 350 ∘ C corresponds to high uniformity in NiO crystallite size. For 30% Ni/ZrO 2 , only one sharp broad peak was observed at 344 ∘ C for strongly bonded NiO species. The TPR profile of the other catalysts showed a combined broad reduction peak with increasing ZrO 2 content. The first peak corresponds to larger NiO particles having lower interaction with support. The width of the peaks suggests a broad particle size distribution, and that NiO exhibited a stronger interaction with the support than the NiO present in Ni/CeO 2 catalyst. With increasing ZrO 2 content, the peak at lower temperature merged with the higher temperature peak, and the intensity of higher temperature peak also reduced. Moreover, the second reduction peak shifted to a higher temperature. This indicates that with increasing ZrO 2 content the interaction of NiO particles with the support increases. The TPR results showed the existence of a distribution of NiO crystallite sizes having different interactions with the support and these support interactions of Ni/CeO 2 –ZrO 2 catalyst are quite different than those found in Ni/CeO 2 and Ni/ZrO 2 . The TPR profile of unsupported NiO and Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 catalysts with various Ni loading (10–40wt%) are shown in Fig. 7 . The unsupported NiO shows a reduction peak at 369 ∘ C. With an increase in the metal loading from 10% to 20%, the intensity of the peak at 314 ∘ C increased significantly due to increasing NiO content. With further increase in metal loading to 30wt%, the peak at 247 ∘ C shifted towards higher temperature and merged with the second peak, showing that with increasing metal loading interaction of NiO with the support increases, and presence of free NiO reduces. With an increase in metal loading from 10 to 30wt%, the reduction temperature increased, i.e. the catalyst with higher metal loading was less reducible. At a metal loading of 40wt%, only one sharp broad peak was observed. This is attributed to agglomerated NiO. The degree of reduction of nickel was calculated by assuming that the degree of reduction of the support in Ni/CeO 2 –ZrO2 was the same as for unsupported Ce–ZrO 2 supports. The calculated values are shown in Table 2. The results show that NiO in the catalyst was not reduced completely. At a fixed metal loading (30wt%), for 30% Ni/CeO 2 and 30% Ni/ZrO 2 the nickel reduction was nearly the same i.e. 42.0% and 38.2%, respectively, whereas for 30% Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 catalyst, the nickel reduction was highest (78.1%). For 30% Ni/Ce 0.41 Zr 0.59 O 2 and 30% Ni/Ce 0.16 Zr 0.84 O 2 , the nickel reduction value was lowest at 23.6% and 25.6%, respectively. The lower value of nickel reduction suggests that on these supports the interaction of nickel with the support is high. In contrast to the results reported by Dong et al. [26], on the same support with an increase in metal loading from 10 to 40wt%, the nickel reduction decreased from 97.3% to 59.5%. This may be because of agglomeration of nickel particles with increasing metal loading. The hydrogen uptake, nickel dispersion and nickel surface area of Ni/CeO 2 –ZrO2 catalysts obtained from hydrogen pulse chemisorption are shown in Table 3 . For calculation of dispersion, the stoichiometry of chemisorption of hydrogen atom on nickel was assumed to be 1. As can be seen from Table 3, for mixed oxide supports at a fixed metal loading (30wt%), with increasing ZrO 2 content in the support, the hydrogen uptake, dispersion and nickel surface area increased. On the same support, with an increase in metal loading, dispersion increased up to 20wt% metal loading and decreased at higher loadings. Similar trends of dispersion with nickel loading on CeO 2 –ZrO 2 support have been reported by Dong et al. [26], who also reported dispersion in the range of 0.41–1.05%. Due to the higher calcination temperature used in this study (750 ∘ C), the nickel dispersion was lower than those reported by Laosiripojana and Assabumrungrat [20] and Pengpanich et al. [23]."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance 3.2.1 Effect of support To study the effect of support on the activity and product distribution, experiments were conducted on catalysts with a constant nickel loading of 30wt%. The effect of temperature on catalytic activity of the catalyst was examined at the same space velocity ( W / F A 0 = 4.06 gcath/mol). Table 4 shows the catalytic behavior of the different 30% Ni/Ce 1 - x Zr x O 2 catalysts over a temperature of 400–650 ∘ C. The decline in activity of these Ni–CeO 2 –ZrO 2 catalysts system was tested for 25h. Initially, the activity declined appreciably but after 4h, the rate of deactivation was very slow. Therefore, all the reported data were collected after a run time of 4h. For most of the catalysts, the main products were H 2 , CO, CH 4 and CO 2 . These are products of both SR and WGS reactions that take place simultaneously in the reactor. Minor amounts of byproducts, such as CH 3 CHO, C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 and CH 3 COCH 3 , were also observed with some catalysts; their concentration exhibiting a strong dependence on reaction temperature. As shown in Table 4, in all cases, the conversion of ethanol increased with temperature. Depending on the support composition, the conversion and product selectivities were quite different. At 400 ∘ C, the highest conversion was obtained on ZrO 2 support whereas nickel supported on Ce 0.41 Zr 0.59 O 2 gave the lowest conversion. At 550 ∘ C, conversions obtained on CeO 2 , Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 and ZrO 2 supports were above 90% but were much lower on Ce 0.41 Zr 0.59 O 2 and Ce 0.16 Zr 0.84 O 2 . For Ni/ZrO 2 and Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 , with increasing temperature, selectivity to H 2 and CO 2 increased, selectivity to CH 4 decreased and selectivity to CO passed through a minima. On both these catalysts, selectivity to CH 3 CHO decreased with temperature and acetone formation was negligible. On Ni/CeO 2 , selectivity to H 2 increased with temperature but was lower in comparison to the above two catalysts. On the other hand, with increasing temperature, selectivity to CO 2 and CH 4 passed through a maxima, whereas selectivity to CO showed a minima. Considerable amount of side products (C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , CH 3 CHO and CH 3 COCH 3 ) were obtained on this catalyst. The product selectivities as well as the variation of product selectivities with temperature were quite different on Ce 0.41 Zr 0.59 O 2 and Ce 0.16 Zr 0.84 O 2 . On these two catalysts, selectivity to CO and CH 4 increased with temperature. The selectivity of CO 2 obtained at the highest temperature (650 ∘ C) was much lower in comparison to the other catalysts. Moreover, the selectivity to H 2 was also much lower. Significant amounts of CH 3 CHO, CH 3 COCH 3 , C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 6 were obtained. Unlike the other catalysts, even at the highest temperature, CH 3 CHO was obtained in significant amounts. The best results were obtained for 30% Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 catalyst. The maximum hydrogen selectivity (5.8mol/mol of ethanol reacted) was obtained at a relatively lower temperature (at around 600 ∘ C) which is comparable to the theoretical selectivity of 6.0 mol of hydrogen per mol of ethanol reacted. At this temperature the ethanol conversion was nearly 100% and the selectivities of CO, CH 4 , CO 2 were 0.47, 0.35, 1.15mol/ mol of ethanol reacted, respectively. Haryanto et al. [28] have summarized the reaction pathways that can occur during ethanol SR over metal catalysts. The important reactions include: (2) C 2 H 5 OH → CH 3 CHO + H 2 , (3) C 2 H 5 OH → C 2 H 4 + H 2 O , (4) CH 3 CHO → CH 4 + CO , (5) CH 3 CHO + H 2 O → 2 CO + 3 H 2 , (6) CH 4 + H 2 O ⇌ CO + 3 H 2 , (7) CO + H 2 O ⇌ CO 2 + H 2 , (8) 2 CH 3 CHO → CH 3 COCH 3 + CO + H 2 . On Ni/ZrO 2 and Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 , the decrease in selectivity of CH 4 and increase in the selectivity of CO 2 with temperature suggests that SR of methane and the WGS have not reached equilibrium. On these catalysts, above 550 ∘ C, rates of decomposition and reforming of CH 3 CHO (reactions (4) and (5)) are much faster than rate of formation of CH 3 CHO resulting in very low selectivity of CH 3 CHO at high temperature. Negligible amount of acetone suggests that reaction (8) was not favored on these supports. A notable feature of the product selectivities obtained on Ni/CeO 2 was the significant amount of CH 3 COCH 3 at temperature below 500 ∘ C and the presence of C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 6 . This indicates that on this catalyst, dehydration of ethanol was also favored. The relatively large amount of acetone and relatively lower amount of CH 4 shows that this catalyst had a weaker capability of breaking the C–C bond in ethanol. Nishiguchi et al. [29] reported that acetone formation is catalyzed by the basic sites of CeO 2 . The decrease in the selectivity of CO 2 above 600 ∘ C shows that the reverse WGS reaction occurred at higher temperatures. The low selectivity of H 2 and the high yields of CH 3 CHO and CH 3 COCH 3 obtained on Ni/Ce 0.16 Zr 0.84 O 2 and Ni/Ce 0.41 Zr 0.59 O 2 , indicates that the reforming activity on these catalysts was low. From the above results, it is clear that for Ni/CeO 2 –ZrO2 catalysts, support plays a very important role in the SR process. As reported by Trovarelli et al. [22], for ceria–zirconia system, monoclinic, tetragonal or cubic phases are possible. At high CeO 2 concentration (CeO 2 > 80%mol), the cubic phase is favored, whereas for ZrO 2 -rich solid solution, the monoclinic phase is favored. For intermediate composition, both cubic and tetragonal phases co-exist [30]. The reduction property of the catalyst strongly depends on the nature of the phase present and the activity of the samples is related to their reducibility i.e. the quantity of Ni 0 present on the surface. For ceria and ceria–zirconia supported catalysts, the activity correlated with the reduction degree of Ni (refer Table 2) i.e. 30% Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 showed the highest activity whereas 30% Ni/Ce 0.41 Zr 0.59 O 2 was the least active. However, Ni/ZrO 2 did not follow this trend. Even though the reduction degree for this catalyst was lower than for 30% Ni/CeO 2 , its activity was higher. This could be due to the difference in the nature of phases present. Another reason for the high activity of 30% Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.16 O 2 for SR may be due to the high oxygen storage capacity of cubic Ce 0.74 Zr 0.16 O 2 [22,31]. This helps to increase the availability of surface oxygen [32] which can enhance the WGS reaction [33]. It has been reported that cubic Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 is more easily reducible and has better capability of undergoing redox coupling between of Ce 3 + and Ce 4 + than the other phases of CeO 2 –ZrO 2 [22,31,34–36]. 3.2.2 Effect of metal loading The effect of metal loading and temperature on ethanol conversion and product selectivities over the x % Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 ( x = 10 , 20, 30, 40) are shown in Figs. 8–13 . As expected, ethanol conversion increased with temperature. With an increase in metal loading, conversion of ethanol was higher. Above 600 ∘ C, nearly complete conversion was obtained with 30 and 40wt% nickel loaded catalysts. For 10% Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 even at 650 ∘ C, the conversion was 89%. The variation of conversion with nickel loading was found to correlate with the hydrogen consumed during TPR (refer Table 2). The variation of hydrogen selectivity with temperature and metal loading is shown in Fig. 9. For all metal loadings, hydrogen selectivity was low below 500 ∘ C and significantly increased above 550 ∘ C. Above 550 ∘ C, with an increase in metal loading, the selectivity of hydrogen substantially increased. The selectivity of hydrogen obtained for 30 and 40wt% was comparable. A possible reason for the lower H 2 selectivity for 40wt% below 500 ∘ C could be the low rate of methane reforming reaction. For Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, Akande et al. [37] reported that with increasing Ni loading the H 2 selectivity was reduced. The selectivity of CO 2 , CO, CH 4 and CH 3 CHO as a function of temperature at different metal loadings are shown in Figs. 10–13. The selectivity towards CO 2 increased with increasing temperature as well as metal loading, while selectivity to CO showed a minimum with increasing temperature. A significant increase of CO selectivity was observed on increasing the metal loading from 10 to 20wt% but further increase in metal loading did not have a significant effect on the CO selectivity. The selectivity to CH 4 decreased with temperature and increased with metal loading (Fig. 12). Selectivity to CH 3 CHO decreased exponentially with increasing temperature and at higher temperatures it was essentially zero. With increasing metal loading, the selectivity to CH 3 CHO decreased. At low temperatures ( < 450 ∘ C), a significant amount of CH 3 CHO was obtained for all the catalysts. The high selectivity towards CH 3 CHO suggests that dehydrogenation of ethanol (reaction (2)) is relatively high at low ethanol conversions. Apparently, acetaldehyde is a primary product. With increase in temperature, acetaldehyde undergoes further reforming according to reaction (5), and as a result the concentration of CH 3 CHO becomes nearly zero at high conversions. With increasing metal loading, acetaldehyde reforming reaction becomes faster and as a result, selectivity to CH 3 CHO is suppressed. From Figs. 11 and 12, it can be observed that at lower temperatures selectivity to CO and CH 4 are almost equal; suggesting that at lower temperature CO and CH 4 formation takes place by dissociation of acetaldehyde according to reaction (4). With increasing temperature, selectivity of CH 4 decreases, due to its reformation with H 2 O (according to reaction (6)), which becomes thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures [9]. At high temperatures, the product composition is controlled by methane reforming reaction and WGS reaction (reaction (7)). When temperature increases, methane and water are consumed resulting in increase in the selectivities of H 2 and CO 2 ."
8,Characterization of used catalyst,"3.3 Characterization of used catalyst As mentioned earlier, for these catalysts the activity initially declined rapidly followed by a very slow decrease in the activity. At 600 ∘ C and W/F A 0 of 4.06gcath/mol, the activity of 30% Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 catalyst decreased by 7.8% in the first 4h whereas between a run time of 4–25h, the decrease in activity was 2.4%. To gain some insight on the state of the catalyst after the SR reaction, the XRD and TPR analysis of the used catalyst were carried out. From the XRD results (Fig. 14 a), we observe that the intensity of all peaks corresponding to NiO were significantly decreased and the peak corresponding to NiO (200) plane shifted slightly towards the higher 2 θ degree, whereas the peaks corresponding to CeO 2 –ZrO 2 mixed oxide were almost unaffected. It should be mentioned that the XRD and TPR of the fresh catalyst were taken after calcination whereas for the used catalysts these analysis were done after in situ reduction followed by reforming reaction. The lower intensity of the NiO peaks in the used catalyst is due to the reduction of NiO to Ni 0 and the shifting of the NiO peaks occurs probably due to the change in the metal–support interaction. The XRD results showed a good agreement with the TPR results (Fig. 14b). By comparing the TPR profiles of used and fresh catalyst it can be observed that the peak obtained at 238 ∘ C for used catalyst (Fig. 14b) corresponds to the reduction of small amount of free NiO present on the catalyst. The lower reduction peak shows that this NiO had a weak interaction with the support. The peak obtained at 513 ∘ C is attributed to the reduction of bulk CeO 2 . These results show that most of the nickel in the used catalyst was not oxidized in the reaction atmosphere, which would have contributed to the stability of the catalyst."
9,Conclusions,"Incorporation of zirconia in ceria significantly affects the properties of the ceria–zirconia support and the properties of the nickel catalysts prepared using these supports. The reforming capability of Ni/Ce 0.16 Zr 0.84 O 2 and Ni/Ce 0.41 Zr 0.59 O 2 catalyst is low whereas the highest activity is obtained on nickel supported on Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 . The reduction behavior of the nickel catalyst strongly depends on the support and catalyst activity for ceria and ceria–zirconia supported catalyst could be related to the degree of reduction of nickel. The conversion and hydrogen selectivity increase with increasing nickel content. The 30% Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 catalyst shows high activity as well as a high selectivity to hydrogen. For this catalyst, at a temperature of 600 ∘ C, the ethanol conversion is 100% and the maximum hydrogen selectivity of 5.8mol/mol of ethanol reacted is obtained. The high activity of 30% Ni/Ce 0.74 Zr 0.26 O 2 for SR is most likely due to the higher amount of reduced nickel available for reaction. For all catalysts, significant amount of acetaldehyde is produced at lower temperatures due to the dehydrogenation of ethanol. Even though the decline in catalyst activity is not appreciable till a run time of 25h, the characterization of the used catalyst indicates that XRD and TPR are affected."
