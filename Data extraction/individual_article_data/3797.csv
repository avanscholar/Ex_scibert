0,Introduction,"Cyclohexanone is used for the synthesis of adipic acid and caprolactam [1,2], the important intermediates for syntheses of nylons and polyamide resins. Industrially, cyclohexanone is produced by the oxidation of cyclohexane [3–6]. However, the mentioned process requires relatively harsh conditions with ∼ 4 % of cyclohexane conversion and 82–84 % of cyclohexanone selectivity, resulting in complex collection and separation steps [3]. Therefore, a greener route for cyclohexanone production is highly desired. Recently, due to the increasing supplies of phenol from the coal chemical industry, using phenol as the raw materials to produce cyclohexanone receives more and more attentions [7–12]. Hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone can be carried out by a one-step or two-step method [13–16]. The former directly hydrogenates phenol to cyclohexanone [13,14] while the latter first hydrogenates phenol to cyclohexanol and then dehydrogenates cyclohexanol to obtain cyclohexanone [15,16]. From the viewpoint of green chemistry, the one-step selective hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone is preferred. Either gas- or liquid-phase reaction can be applied in hydrogenation of phenol [17–21]. Compared with the gas-phase process, the liquid-phase phenol hydrogenation can be operated at relatively low temperatures, and could have a better lifetime of catalysts [20,21]. However, the biggest challenge for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of phenol is to achieve high cyclohexanone selectivity at elevated phenol conversions. In the last decade, numerous catalytic systems are reported for phenol hydrogenation, including palladium [22], nickel [23], rhodium [24] and platinum [25], as well as their bimetallic systems [26–28]. Among these systems, Pd-based catalysts are well recognized as the most efficient for the phenol hydrogenation. For example, A dual-supported Pd catalyst reported by Han and co-workers shows high phenol conversion (> 99.9 %) and cyclohexanone selectivity (> 99.9 %) within 7 h at 50 °C and 1.0 MPa of H2 [7], where the use of environmentally harmful Lewis acid is required. Mesoporous hollow silica spheres supported gold-promoted Pd catalysts show a good performance at 50 °C and 1.0 MPa of H2, achieving high cyclohexanone selectivity (> 96 %) at a high phenol conversion (> 97.5 %) with 45 min [27]. Various supports, such as SiO2 [29,30], Al2O3 [20], MgO [31], TiO2 [32,33], ZrO2 [34], CeO2 [35,36], hydroxyapatite [18], MOFs MIL-101 [37] and activated carbon [38–40], have been applied in phenol hydrogenation. For example, alkali-metal-promoted Pd/TiO2 was reported in literature to achieve a 99.0 % phenol conversion and 99.0 % cyclohexanone selectivity at mild conditions of 80 °C and H2 partial pressure of 0.06 MPa in water [33]. Except for catalysts, reaction temperatures [22,41–43] and solvents [18,20,36,44] also have important effects on the catalytic performance. Although various organic solvents, elevated reaction temperatures or H2 pressures [22,27] have been employed to accelerate the phenol hydrogenation rates, it would be ideal to carry out the reaction at atmospheric pressure of H2 and low temperatures in water. Recently, Pd-based systems for selective hydrogenation to cyclohexanone have achieved a big progress, such as Pd-HAP [18], Pd@mpg-C3N4 [39], m-Pd/C [45] and Pd/Ⓕ-MeOx/AC [46]. Despite process on supported Pd catalysts for phenol selective hydrogenation, their catalytic performances with high selectivity of cyclohexanone (> 98.0 %) at high conversions of phenol (> 98.0 %) in aqueous-phase are rarely achieved [39,47]. Herein, we report highly efficient Pd nanoparticles (NPs) encaged hollow mesoporous silica nanoreactors (Pd@HMSNs) for selective hydrogenations of phenol, cresols and chlorophenols to cyclohexanone derivatives. Pd@HMSNs feature ∼ 4 nm Pd NPs in ∼ 16 nm hollow cavities of ∼ 30 nm HMSNs. At atmospheric pressure of H2 and 55 °C in aqueous-phase, Pd@HMSNs demonstrate a high catalytic efficiency with > 98 % of cyclohexanone selectivity at > 98 % of phenol conversions. For hydrogenations of chlorophenols, Pd@HMSNs selectively favor the formation of cyclohexanone, illustrating a beneficial effect for consecutive reactions. Such Pd@HMSNs exhibit high thermal and catalytic stabilities, and own high specific surface areas and pore volume after 750 °C thermal treatment, and show a slight performance decrease after 4 cycles of phenol hydrogenations. Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of Pd@HMSNs and their application in phenol selective hydrogenation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Nitric acid (HNO3, 65–68 %) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥ 96.0 %) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company. Phenol (≥ 99.0 %) was purchased from General-Reagent. Ethanol (AR), oleylamine (80–90 %), cyclohexanone (99.0 %), cyclohexanol (> 98.5 %), palladium chloride (Pd, 59–60 %) and potassium tetrachloropalladate (K2PdCl4, 98 %) were purchased from Aladdin. n-Butyllithium solution (2.5 M in cyclohexane), p-chlorophenol (≥ 99.0 %), m-chlorophenol (≥ 99.0 %) and o-chlorophenol (≥ 99.0 %) were purchased from Adamas-beta. Silica dioxide (SiO2, 99.5 %) and 1-octadecene (> 90 %) were purchased from Macklin. Ethyl silicate (TEOS, SiO2 ≥ 28.4 %), p-methylphenol (p-cresol, ≥ 99.0 %) and m-methylphenol (m-cresol, ≥ 99.0 %) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.. The synthetic procedure of quaternized diblock copolymer poly(2-vinylpyridine)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (positively charged P2MVP128-b-PEO477, Mw/Mn = 1.1, Mw = 34.5 k) is described in the previous work [48]. The 1,3,5-tris(2,6-dicarboxypyridin-4-yloxymethyl)benzene (L3) was synthesized according to the literature [49]. All reagents were used without further purification."
3,Syntheses of Pd@HMSNs and control supported Pd/SiO2 catalysts,"2.2 Syntheses of Pd@HMSNs and control supported Pd/SiO2 catalysts 2.2.1 Synthesis of Pd@HMSNs The synthesis is similar to our previous work [50,51]. In a typical synthesis, 1.440 mL of 5.0 mM K2PdCl4 aqueous solution, 1.440 mL of 0.087 mM quaternized P2MVP128-b-PEO477 aqueous solution and 0.960 mL of 5.0 mM L3 aqueous solution were mixed with 36.16 mL of deionized water in a 50 mL beaker with a magnetic stirring at 200 rpm, where the molar ratio of polymer/L3/Pd is equal to 1/38.3/57.5. Diluted nitric acid or sodium hydroxide aqueous solution is added to adjust the pH value of the solution to 4.1 ∼ 4.2. The resultant solution was stirred overnight, and then 0.290 mL of TEOS is added into the system. The mixture was further stirred for at least 48 h (white precipitates will appear during 24−48 h). To polymerize orthosilicic acid to form silica, the solution was left untouched for at least one more day. After that, the solids were collected by centrifugation and washed by water and ethanol several times. The collected white solids were dried at 55 °C overnight in an oven and further calcined at 350−750 °C in a muffle furnace for 3.0 h to obtain PdO@HMSNs. The Pd@HMSNs were prepared by reduction of PdO@HMSNs with H2 at 200−350 °C for 3.0 h in a tube furnace. The real Pd loading of Pd@HMSNs is 3.4 wt %. 2.2.2 Synthesis of control supported Pd/SiO2 catalysts The impregnation of pre-synthesized Pd NPs with silica is used to prepare supported Pd/SiO2. Pd NPs were obtained by reduction of Pd precursors with butyllithium in a standard Schlenk line under N2 [52]. Briefly, 25.0 mL of 1-octadecene were stirred in a N2 atmosphere at 80 °C. Next, 1.0 mL butyllithium solution (2.5 M in cyclohexane) was injected into the system, and followed by the injection of the Pd precursor solution containing 0.15 mmol PdCl2, 3.0 mL oleylamine and 2.0 mL 1-octadecence. The color of the resultant solution quickly turns to black, indicating the reduction of Pd precursors by butyllithium. After being stirred for 20 min at 80 °C, the system was heated to 220 °C, and further aged at 220 °C for 2.0 h. Upon cooling to room temperature, the Pd NPs were collected by centrifugation of the colloid with acetone and ethanol serval times. The collected Pd NPs were re-dispersed in 30 mL of alcohol under sonification, and then 0.450 g SiO2 was added into colloid under vigorous stirring. The mixture was heated to 60 °C to remove the alcohol with a N2 purging. The obtained gray powders were dried at 60 °C in an oven, and further calcined at 650 °C for 3.0 h in a muffle furnace followed by H2 reduction at 250 °C for 3.0 h in a tube furnace to give the control Pd/SiO2. The real Pd loading of Pd/SiO2 is 2.6 wt %."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of various materials were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. The images of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microcopy (HRTEM) were taken in a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images with EDS line-scans were obtained using a Titan G2 80–200 ChemiSTEM operated at 200 kV for STEM model. The actual Pd loadings of samples were determined by an Agilent 725 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). A Micromeritics ASAP-2020 automatic specific surface area and porous physical adsorption analyzer was used to obtain Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area, pore size distribution and the adsorption/desorption isotherms of various materials by N2 adsorption at 77 K. The H2 temperature programmed reductions (H2-TPR) of PdO@HMSNs and PdO/SiO2 were investigated with an AutoChemII 2920 instrument in the temperature range from room temperature to 800 °C. Uv–vis measurements were carried out using a UV-1800 spectrophotometer and pure water as background."
5,Catalytic activity measurement,"2.4 Catalytic activity measurement 2.4.1 Catalytic hydrogenations of phenolic compounds In a typical run, 0.10 mmol phenolic compounds in 4.0 mL H2O, 0.0100 g of Pd@HMSNs (3.4 wt %) or 0.0130 g of Pd/SiO2 (2.6 wt %) were loaded into a 10 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask. The hydrogenation reactions were carried out by H2 bubbling with a vigorous stirring at a defined temperature for a defined time. The reaction mixtures were sampled at defined time intervals to collect liquid products for analysis by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector. 2.4.2 Catalytic stability experiments of Pd@HMSNs Recycling experiments of Pd@HMSNs were conducted to evaluate their catalytic stability. In the first catalytic run, a portion of 0.0600 g Pd@HMSNs, 0.60 mmol phenol and 24.0 mL of H2O were loaded, and the hydrogenation of phenol with H2 was carried out at 65 °C for 3.0 h. After the catalytic reaction, the catalysts were collected by centrifugation, washing and drying in the oven at 55 °C, and then reused in next runs. Because a few of catalysts were lost during the recovery process, the amounts of reactants and solvents in the following cycle were proportional to the amount of the recovered catalysts to keep the ratios of catalysts/phenol and phenol/H2O constant. Carbon balance is ∼ 98 %, and quantification of components is based on relative response factor of components and their surface areas in GC. After hydrogenation, we first run the product samples to obtain relative surface areas of components, and then add known amount of phenol into the samples if the phenol conversions is high or add known amount of cyclohexanone into the samples if the phenol conversions is low. Since we already know the relative response factors of components, and have GC chromatogram of sample and sample with a known amount of phenol or cyclohexanone, we can calculate the phenol conversions and cyclohexanone selectivity. Because the method is the external standard method, and the phenol conversions and cyclohexanone selectivity are accurate no matter what the carbon balance is."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization In the synthesis [50], L3 ligands coordinate Pd2+ ions to form a negatively charged complex network, which further combines with positively charged P2MVP128-b-EO477 by electrostatic attraction to obtain metal ions bound micelles. After silica deposition, the silicified micelles are obtained, which contains metal ions bound micelles cores and silica shells. The following calcination of silicified micelles results in PdO@HMSNs with small PdO NPs inside hollow cavities, and the subsequent H2 reduction will give Pd@HMSNs. In the synthesis, using the core-shell like silicified micelles with Pd ions containing complex networks as cores is the prerequisite for the residence of Pd NPs inside hollow cavities, and the interaction between Pd NPs and silica inner walls by thermal treatment is also beneficial for anchoring Pd NPs in the hollow cavities. Fig. 1 shows TEM images of Pd@HMSNs before and after treatment while their corresponding size distributions are illustrated in Figure S1. As shown in Fig. 1a, silicified micelles display the structures of connected non-hollow nanospheres with ∼31.5 nm particle size (Figure S1a). After calcination at 450 °C to remove organic materials, PdO@HMSNs in Fig. 1b show the structures of hollow spherical nanoreactors with a whole particle size of ∼ 29.9 nm and a void space size of ∼ 15.2 nm (Figure S1b). Figure S2a presents HAADF-STEM images of PdO@HMSNs. Due to the high contrast between SiO2 and PdO in dark-field model, PdO NPs are clearly visible in the hollow cavities. EDS line-scans (Fig. 1g) and XRD patterns (Figure S2b) of PdO@HMSNs further confirm that the inner NPs inside cavities are PdO. Fig. 1c-1f show TEM images of Pd@HMSNs after 250 °C H2 reduction with previous calcinations at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 1c to 1f, when the calcination temperatures increase from 450 to 750 °C with the same reduction at 250 °C, the hollow nanostructures of Pd@HMSNs keep intact. The typical Pd@HMSNs prepared by calcination at 650 °C and follow reduction at 250 °C (the optimal catalysts for phenol hydrogenation) show the average sizes of whole particles/void spaces of 29.3 nm/15.1 nm (Fig. 1h) and inner Pd NPs of 4.5 nm (Fig. 1i), and the corresponding size distributions of other materials are demonstrated in Figure S3. Moreover, the sizes of whole particles/voids (Figure S3a, S3c and S3e) only show a slight decrease from 29.7/16.8–27.3/14.7 (nm/nm), suggesting their high thermal stability of such hollow silica nanoreactors. Fig. 2 a shows their corresponding XRD patterns of Pd@HMSNs in Fig. 1c-1f. As indicated by the appearance of characteristic fcc Pd diffractions, PdO@HMSNs are converted to Pd@HMSNs after 250 °C H2 reductions. As for inner Pd NPs, their sizes increase from ∼ 3.8 nm at 450 °C calcination to ∼4.7 nm at 750 °C calcination (Figure S3b, S3d and S3f). The Pd size increasing at higher calcination temperature is well consistent with XRD patterns in Fig. 2a, where the XRD diffractions become a little sharper with the calcination temperatures increasing. As indicated by the nearly identical XRD diffractions in Fig. 2b, TEM images in Figure S4 and the size distributions in Figure S5, the H2 reductions at 200–350 °C will not obviously change the average particle sizes (4.3–4.5 nm) of inner Pd NPs. Fig. 3 demonstrates their N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of Pd@HMSNs after calcination at various temperatures and subsequently H2 reduction at 250 °C. As shown in Fig. 3a, all tested Pd@HMSNs show type IV isotherms with characteristic hysteresis loops, confirming mesoporous structures [53–56]. In Fig. 3a, the forced closures at P/P0 ∼ 0.46 in the desorption branches is the evidence of the formation of hollow cavities [55], and is due to the delay of N2 evaporation from hollow voids blocked by surrounding mesoporous walls [56]. Moreover, the adsorption uptakes at ∼ 0.90 of P/P0 result from those aggregation voids between connected nanoreactors [54]. The pores size distributions by BJH method of Pd@HMSNs are shown in Fig. 3b. All curves show distinct mesoporous pores between 6 and 8 nm, confirming the formation of mesoporous nanostructures. Table 1 presents textural properties of Pd@HMSNs after calcinations at different temperatures and subsequently 250 °C H2 reductions. As shown in Table 1, with calcination temperatures increasing from 450 to 750 °C, BET specific surface areas first increase from 328 to 566 m2/g then decrease from 566 to 312 m2/g. Pore volumes/average pore sizes of Pd@HMSNs calcined at different temperatures first change from 0.94/15.9 to 1.35/15.9 (cm3 g−1/nm) then decrease from 1.35/15.9 to 0.81/11.5 (cm3 g−1/nm) with the calcination temperatures increasing from 450 to 750 °C. Usually, the specific surface areas and pore volumes will decrease with the calcination temperatures increasing. The increase of these parameters from 450 to 550 °C calcination is difficult to understand since no detectable organic components are found for Pd@HMSNs prepared by calcination at 450 °C by FT-IR studies (Figure S6). As shown in Figure S6, a peak of ∼ 2920 cm-1 and a series of peaks from 1300 to 1500 cm-1 are clearly visible before calcination, where the former is the asymmetric stretching vibration of methylene of polymer and the latter is the asymmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylic groups of L3 ligands, respectively. After calcination at 450 °C for 3.0 h, these mentioned peaks totally disappear, confirming no detectable organic components in the materials by FT-IR. We speculate that some trace organic components still reside in the materials prepared at 450 °C calcination, and the removal of these trace organic components at 550 °C calcination causes the increase of specific surface areas and pore volumes. However, Pd@HMSNs after 750 °C calcination and 250 °C H2 reduction still show high BET specific surface areas of 312 m2/g with a high pore volume of 0.81 cm3/g. Considering such a high calcination temperature of 750 °C for silica materials, such hollow mesoporous Pd@HMSNs developed in this work own an excellent thermal stability, and silica materials reported in literatures have significantly lower BET specific surface areas at such high calcination temperatures [57]."
8,Catalytic hydrogenations of phenolic compounds,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenations of phenolic compounds Hydrogenations of phenolic compounds over Pd@HMSNs were carried out at ambient H2 pressure with vigorous stirring. The real Pd loading of Pd@HMSNs is 3.4 wt % by ICP-OES. As shown in Figure S6, after calcination at 350 °C for 3.0 h, the characteristic peaks of organic components disappear, confirming no detectable organic components in the materials by FT-IR. Although we just measured the actual Pd loading of Pd@HMSNs calcined at 550 °C by ICP-OES, the actual Pd loadings of Pd@HMSNs should be nearly same since organic components (if Pd@HMSNs have) will only account for a very small amount of the mass of Pd@HMSNs prepared by calcination at ≥ 350 °C. The phenol absorption on catalysts is investigated by Uv–vis spectra. As shown in Figure S7, the phenol absorption on Pd@HMSNs is ≤ 2.6 % while that on Pd/SiO2 is negligible, and the difference is possibly due to the high specific surface areas and hollow mesoporous nanostructures of Pd@HMSNs. Fig. 4 presents catalytic phenol hydrogenations over Pd@HMSNs with treatments at various conditions. As shown in Fig. 4a and 4b, Pd@HMSNs with calcination at 650 °C and the following H2 reduction at 250 °C show the highest cyclohexanone yield of 97.3 % for phenol hydrogenations in water. The textural properties, Pd particle size and metal-support interaction can influence the catalytic performance. As shown in Figure S5b, S5d, S5f and Fig. 1i, reductions at 200 to 350 °C will not cause a big change of particle size. Moreover, the BET surface areas and pore volumes of Pd@HMSNs with 650 °C calcination and following 250 °C H2 reduction only rank the second highest in Table 1. Therefore, we speculate that the best catalytic performance at 650 °C calcination and following 250 °C H2 reduction is possibly due to the formation of suitable metal-silica interaction by the treatments. Table S1 shows the effects of solvents on phenol conversions and cyclohexanone selectivity for phenol hydrogenations. As presented in Table S1, phenol hydrogenation is significantly accelerated in water, and reaches 99.0 % of phenol conversion and 98.3 % of cyclohexanone selectivity. Why the water media is better than other solvents is not clear in this study, but the dispersion of Pd@HMSNs in solvents, the polarity of the solvents and the phenol diffusion in solvents may influence the catalytic performance of Pd@HMSNs [39,58]. Therefore, hydrogenations in water over Pd@HMSNs with 650 °C calcination and 250 °C reduction were selected for further detailed study. Table 2 presents the effects of reaction temperatures on the catalytic performance of Pd@HMSNs for phenol hydrogenations in water. As shown in Table 2, the conversions of phenol increase with the reaction temperatures increasing. For example, at the reaction time of 4.0 h, the phenol conversion is 53.1 % at the reaction temperature of 35 °C while it reaches 99.0 % at 55 °C. With further increasing the reaction temperature to 65 °C, 100.0 % of phenol conversion is achieved at the reaction time of 3.0 h. As for selectivity, the reaction reaches the highest cyclohexanone selectivity of 98.3 % at 55 °C, lower or higher reaction temperatures will cause the decreasing of cyclohexanone selectivity. Table S2 presents the relationship between the amounts of Pd@HMSNs and the catalytic performance. As expected, the conversions of phenol increase from 61.2 % at 4.0 h with 0.0050 g catalysts to 100.0 % at 3.0 h with 0.0130 g catalysts, and the increase of reaction rates with the catalyst weights increasing is apparently due to more catalysts used in catalytic reactions. Moreover, the effect of the silica shell thickness (metal loadings) on the catalytic performance is shown in Table S3, where the silica shell thickness and the Pd loadings in other words are adjusted by the ratios of TEOS/Pd in the synthesis. At the same total moles of Pd atoms, Pd@HMSNs with a Pd loading of 5.3 wt % show the best catalytic performance with a cyclohexanone yield of 97.1 %, which is apparently due to their thinnest silica shells. Reaction rates are well known to increase with the reaction temperatures increasing, resulting in high phenol conversion at higher temperatures. However, the cyclohexanone selectivity first increases with the reaction temperatures increasing, and then decreases with further increasing temperature to 65 °C. This phenomenon has also been observed in hydrogenation of phenol over Pd/CeO2 in water [36]. With the temperatures increasing, the amount of solved H2 decreases. Therefore, we speculate that the formation of cyclohexanol (the deep hydrogenation product) first decrease with the temperatures increasing due to the less amount of solved H2 at high temperatures, causing the increase of cyclohexanone selectivity. With further increasing temperatures to 65 °C, the acceleration by increasing temperatures becomes the major effect, and more cyclohexanol is formed, resulting in the decrease of cyclohexanone selectivity. To confirm the superior catalytic performance of Pd@HMSNs, the control Pd/SiO2 is prepared for comparison. The classical impregnation of pre-synthesized Pd NPs with silica is used to prepare Pd/SiO2. The synthesis of Pd NPs is according to the previous work [52]. Figure S8 shows the TEM images and Pd particle size histogram of Pd/SiO2. The average Pd particle size is ∼ 5.5 nm, and is slightly larger than that (4.5 nm) of Pd@HMSNs. Since the Pd loading of Pd/SiO2 (2.6 wt %) is lower than that of Pd@HMSNs, more Pd/SiO2 is used to keep the same moles of Pd atoms in each catalytic reaction. Moreover, commercial mesoporous silica with 511 m2/g of BET specific surface areas and 0.81 cm3/g of pore volume is also used to make Pd/SiO2-mesoporous catalysts by the same procedures and treatments. The detailed textural properties of these control catalysts are presented in Table S4. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of phenol hydrogenations over Pd@HMSNs and Pd/SiO2. The control Pd/SiO2 in Fig. 5b reaches 23.7 % of phenol conversion and 86.9 % of cyclohexanone selectivity at the reaction time of 4.0 h, showing a much poorer catalytic performance than that of Pd@HMSNs (Fig. 5a). Although the Pd particle size (∼ 4.5 nm) of Pd@HMSNs is smaller than that (5.5 nm) of Pd/SiO2, this difference cannot explain the dramatic change of conversions from 99.0 % at 4.0 h for Pd@HMSNs to 23.7 % at 4.0 h for Pd/SiO2. Moreover, as shown in Table S4, using mesoporous silica with high specific surface areas also gives a poor catalytic performance, suggesting that the textural properties is not a major factor. Furthermore, H2-TPR studies (Figure S9) of PdO@HMSNs and PdO/SiO2 show a relatively small difference of the reduction temperatures, suggesting that the metal-support interaction is also not the major factor. The superior catalytic performance of Pd@HMSNs should be originated from its unique structure, where the residence of Pd NPs inside hollow cavities increases the collision times of reactant molecules with Pd NPs to achieve high conversions and the protecting mesoporous silica shells allow relatively fast mass transport for catalytic reactions. Phenol hydrogenation to cyclohexanone in water at mild reaction conditions has been reported in literature [59]. However, high cyclohexanone selectivity (≥ 98 %) at high phenol conversion (≥ 98 %) is rarely reported [36]. In this study, 98.3 % of cyclohexanone selectivity at 99.0 % of phenol conversion at the reaction temperature of 55 °C, water media and ambient H2 pressure is achieved with hollow mesoporous Pd@HMSNs. For comparison, Table S5 summarizes the catalytic performance of Pd-related catalysts for phenol hydrogenation. As shown in Table S5, the catalytic performance of the developed Pd@HMSNs in this work for phenol hydrogenation at mild reaction conditions is significantly better than those at similar reaction conditions of related Pd-based catalysts with similar Pd/phenol ratios. Hydrogenations of various phenolic compounds over Pd@HMSNs and Pd/SiO2 are summarized in Table 3 . Entry 1 and Entry 2 show that cresol conversions and methylcyclohexanone selectivity over Pd@HMSNs are ≥ 93.3 % and ≥ 98.3 %, respectively, while those over the control Pd/SiO2 are ≥ 26.9 % and ≥ 83.3 %, respectively. Pd@HMSNs again illustrate superior catalytic performance for hydrogenations of cresols relative to the control Pd/SiO2. Compared with phenol hydrogenation, the reaction rates of cresol hydrogenations are significantly lower, possibly due to the steric hindrance of substituent groups on the phenol ring [30]. Chlorophenols are typically used to prepare pesticides and dyes, and are toxic pollutants in wastewater due to their resistance to degradation [60–63]. Catalytic hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols is a promising technique to transform toxic chlorophenols to less toxic phenol [62]. From the viewpoint of green chemistry, it is worth directly transforming the toxic chlorophenols to cyclohexanone [63], the important intermediate for nylons and polyamide resins [61]. Entries 3–5 in Table 3 show the catalytic performance of Pd@HMSNs for hydrogenations of o-, m- and p-chlorophenol. Indeed, chlorophenol hydrogenations over Pd@HMSNs will obtain cyclohexanone as major products at the defined reaction time while cyclohexanone is the minor products over Pd/SiO2. As indicated by the major product of phenol at the reaction time of 0.5 h (Table S6), the hydrogenation intermediates over Pd@HMSNs are phenol produced by hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols during the transformation of chlorophenols to cyclohexanone. From the comparison between Pd@HMSNs and Pd/SiO2, Pd@HMSNs once more show better catalytic performance than the control Pd/SiO2, further confirming the beneficial effects of hollow mesoporous nanoreactors. Recycling experiments were carried out to investigate the catalytic stability of Pd@HMSNs for phenol hydrogenation. After each cycle, the catalysts were collected by centrifugation, washed by water/ethanol and dried in an oven at 55 °C for the following cycle. Due to the catalyst loss during recovery process, the amounts of phenol and water in the following cycle are proportional to the amount of the recovered Pd@HMSNs. As shown in Fig. 6 , from the first cycle to the fourth cycle, the phenol conversions/cyclohexanone selectivity (%/%) slightly decrease from 99.0/98.7–91.6/96.8, indicating a good catalytic stability of Pd@HMSNs. Figure S10 presents the XRD patterns, TEM images and their corresponding size analysis of the used Pd@HMSNs after recycling experiments while the textural properties of the used Pd@HMSNs are presented in Table S7. Compared with the fresh Pd@HMSNs, no obvious change is observed with the used Pd@HMSNs, suggesting their structural stability of Pd@HMSNs during catalytic reactions. The possible reason for the decrease of conversions from 99.0 % to 91.6 % after 4 cycles is due to the surface reconstruction during catalytic reactions. The mesoporous silica shells of such Pd@HMSNs could protect the inner Pd NPs in hollow cavities, and are beneficial to thermal and catalytic stability. Moreover, residence of active NPs inside hollow cavities can decrease the metal leaching during catalytic reaction. Only 0.27 ppm Pd is detected in the reaction solution after the first cycle in recycling experiments, which accounts for ∼ 0.4 % of total Pd atoms, and Pd is undetectable in solution in the follow cycles, confirming their catalytic and structural stability. Moreover, the mesoporous channels in silica shells allow sufficient mass transport for catalytic reactions, and the residence of Pd NPs in the hollow cavities increase the collision times of reactant molecules with Pd NPs, resulting in enhanced reaction rates. The increased catalytic efficiency over Pd@HMSNs could allow hydrogenation of phenol at relatively low temperatures, and thus enhance the cyclohexanone selectivity. Furthermore, as indicated by the hydrogenation of chlorophenols to cyclohexanone, it is speculated that such Pd@HMSNs could favor the consecutive reactions due to the confinement effect of active NPs in hollow cavities."
9,Conclusions,"In conclusion, hollow mesoporous silica nanoreactors with small Pd NPs inside their cavities are prepared, which features ∼ 4 nm Pd NPs in ∼ 16 nm hollow cavities of ∼ 30 nm mesoporous silica nanoreactors. At the 55 °C reaction temperature, ambient H2 pressure and water media, the synthesized Pd@HMSNs efficiently catalyze hydrogenations of phenol, o- and p-chlorophenols to cyclohexanone with ≥ 97.3 % cyclohexanone selectivity at ≥ 99.0 % reactant conversions while it transforms m-cresol to m-methylcyclohexanone with 98.9 % selectivity at a 100.0 % conversion. The superior catalytic performance of such hollow mesoporous Pd@HMSNs is originated from their unique structures, where the confinement of active NPs inside hollow cavities of mesoporous nanoreactors enhances their catalytic efficiency and stability. We believe that such hollow mesoporous nanoreactors with active NPs inside their cavities will find more applications in heterogeneous catalysis and drug delivery, and could specially accelerate the formation of the final products during the consecutive reactions."
