0,Introduction,"Thermal energy storage (TES) has long been studied and practiced to improve the thermal efficiency of many industrial processes and residential applications, such as industrial waste heat recovery [1], energy-efficient buildings [2], thermal management of electronics [3], and solar thermal utilization [4]. As compared to sensible heat storage, the option of latent heat storage using solid−liquid phase change materials (PCMs) has advantages due to its higher storage density, meaning a more compact design of the TES units, and much smaller temperature span during heat storage/retrieval [5]. The primary requirement for latent heat storage applications is the exploration and identification of appropriate PCMs with a high latent heat storage density at the given temperature range, although many other attributes, such as nontoxicity and chemical and thermal stability, are desired as well. In general, the family of phase change materials having a higher melting point also possesses a higher latent heat storage capacity [5]. At low-to-medium temperature range (below 300 °C), conventional candidates like paraffins can only provide a medium heat storage capacity (∼240 J/g). To obtain higher latent heat, new classes of materials have been explored and tested, including sugar alcohols that also belong to the family of organic PCMs. Sugar alcohols are polyhydric alcohols that are often obtained from hydrogenation of sugars. Despite a long history for serving as sweeteners in the pharmaceutical and food industries, sugar alcohols were proposed relatively recently as candidate PCMs for latent heat storage due to their high latent heat storage capacity. For instance, the reported latent heat of fusion of erythritol is 340 J/g [6], which is comparable to that of water (∼330 J/g but melts at 0 °C). In addition to natural sugar alcohols, binary eutectic mixtures of sugar alcohols have recently been developed to extend the applicable temperature range of this new class of candidate PCMs [6–10]. In order to exploit the high latent heat storage capacity of sugar alcohols, a systematic characterization on their melting and crystallization behaviors is of great significance for a comprehensive evaluation on their storage and retrieval performance. However, the major attention of the existing studies [6,8,9] has only been paid to measuring the melting point and latent heat of fusion upon melting (i.e., corresponding to the charging process) of the variety of pure and mixture sugar alcohols, whereas the equally-significant heat retrieval (or discharging) process upon crystallization of these materials has been ignored by most of them. In fact, there is a hint in the literature, which has even no concern with TES at all, that some common sugar alcohols may have a difficulty in crystallization. For example, xylitol and d-sorbitol were found to be unable to recrystallize from their melt [11,12]. Instead, both remain in the state of supercooled liquids upon cooling and becomes amorphous glassy solids with further decreasing the temperature. This suggests that these two sugar alcohols may not be able to serve as PCMs, because the stored latent heat cannot be retrieved by crystallization at the desirable temperature points. The crystallization-related behaviors are also unclear for the newly developed binary eutectic mixtures. More than 20 binary eutectic mixtures have been tested in the literature, however, the crystallization process has only been characterized for one binary system, i.e., d-mannitol (70 mol%) + d-dulcitol (or galactitol) [7]. It was mentioned by Del Barrio et al. [6] and Diarce et al. [8] that some mixture sugar alcohols tend to vitrify during cool-down without a clear specification of the materials. Del Barrio et al. [6] and Diarce et al. [8] also mentioned that some crystallizable pure and mixture sugar alcohols suffer from severe supercooling. However, the exact supercooling degrees were unable to be determined due to the lack of knowledge on the crystallization points. Based on the foregoing literature survey, it becomes obvious that despite their promisingly high latent heat storage capacity upon melting, sugar alcohols may face serious issues associated with their crystallization process, which could hinder their applications to TES systems that must be operated cyclically. There is no doubt a need to reexamine sugar alcohols and their binary eutectic mixtures by giving a special attention to their crystallization behaviors. The workflow in this study was organized as shown schematically in Fig. 1 . The long list of isomers of common sugar alcohols was first shortened by considering their cost towards large-scale practical uses. Binary eutectic mixtures were then prepared based on the pre-screened affordable sugar alcohols. The characterization on melting and crystallization behaviors of the pure and mixture sugar alcohols could be done in two ways: (a) non-isothermal test with the samples being heated/cooled at various constant ramping/cooling rates, and (b) isothermal test with the samples being heated/cooled at constant heating/cooling temperatures. In this part (I), the test results following the non-isothermal strategy will be presented. In addition to determination of the melting point and latent heat of fusion of the pure and mixture sugar alcohols, their crystallization behaviors were examined carefully with respect to the crystallization point, supercooling degree, and latent heat of crystallization. By conducting consecutive non-isothermal melting-crystallization tests, the recrystallization performance was also evaluated. An advanced screening of the pure and mixture sugar alcohols was thus carried out by analyzing their crystallization behaviors."
1,Screening principles and procedure,
2,Preliminary screening by cost,"2.1 Preliminary screening by cost The general formula of sugar alcohols is HOCH2(CHOH) n CH2OH. There is an OH group attached to each carbon atom, and the various sugar alcohols differ in both chain length and relative orientation of the OH groups. Glycerol is a kind of sugar alcohol which has the shortest chain of only three carbon atoms. As mentioned, most of the sugar alcohols suitable for the low-to-medium temperature range have four to six carbons (see Table 1 ). Although natural sugar alcohols could have more carbons, for example the seven-carbon volemitol, 12-carbon lactitol, 18-carbon maltotritol, and 24-carbon maltotetraitol, these long-chain sugar alcohols were not taken into consideration because either the rarity or the low latent heat of fusion (∼150 J/g) [6]. As listed in Table 1, a total of 17 sugar alcohol isomers were considered as the candidate materials. Also included are the prices of these sugar alcohols at reagent pure grade, which were obtained from the manufacturers. It should be noted that the prices may become much lower for high volume products with relatively lower purities. The quotation was done from two suppliers for each sugar alcohol (with close purities). In general, there is a good consistency between the two quotes for each one. Towards large-scale practical uses, the PCMs should be cost effective. As shown in Table 1, some sugar alcohols are at extremely high costs, such as l-threitol and arabinitol, which should not be recommended for practical applications. The preliminary screening was ended up with selecting six sugar alcohols with relatively low prices (all below ¥5/g), including five linear chain (xylitol, d-sorbitol, erythritol, d-mannitol and d-dulcitol) and one cyclic chain (inositol) sugar alcohols. The following work was performed based on this preliminary screening result. The as-received sugar alcohol reagents (in the form of powders) were directly used without any further purification."
3,Binary eutectic mixtures,"2.2 Binary eutectic mixtures Based on the pre-screened six pure sugar alcohols by cost, a total of 15 binary eutectic mixtures were prepared and characterized in this work. The general approach to preparation of eutectic mixture PCMs is to blend the liquid melts of the components by mechanical stirring, followed by subsequent cooling to create solid samples [7]. However, in consideration of the possible difficulty of crystallization of some pure and mixture sugar alcohols upon cooling, the above-mentioned melt mixing method was not adopted in this work. Instead, the binary eutectic mixture samples were prepared by directly grinding the mixture of crystalline powders of the two components at the required eutectic molar ratios [13]. This powder grinding method was also adopted in relevant investigations [6,8,9]. The method based on the Gibbs excess energy was employed to determine the eutectic molar ratios. It has been shown that the phase diagrams of binary mixture sugar alcohols can be modeled accurately under the assumption of ideal mixtures [6,8]. The liquidus line of the phase diagram can be determined using the following equations (1) x A = exp [ ( Δ H m, A R T m, A ) ( T − T m, A T ) ] , and (2) x B = exp [ ( Δ H m, B R T m, B ) ( T − T m, B T ) ] , where x is the molar ratio, ΔH m the latent heat of fusion of the sugar alcohol component (J/mol), T the temperature of the binary system (K), T m the melting point of the sugar alcohol component (K) and R the ideal gas constant (J/mol·K). Subscript A and B denote the two components. If the binary system is at its eutectic temperature, then the two molar ratios satisfy (3) x A + x B = 1 . By solving simultaneously the set of three equations, the binary eutectic molar ratios and the eutectic temperature were determined. Then the corresponding mass ratios were calculated by (4) ω A ω B = x A x B M A M B , where ω is the mass fraction and M the molar mass of the pure sugar alcohol component. By neglecting the difference of specific heat capacity between the solid and liquid phases, the theoretical latent heat of fusion of a eutectic mixture was simply estimated by (5) Δ H m , e = x A Δ H m , A + x B Δ H m , B . In this work, the molar (and hence mass) ratios of the 15 binary eutectic systems were only calculated theoretically based on this thermodynamic model, which were not further validated experimentally. The eutectic mixture sample was prepared by mixing the two sugar alcohol components at the required mass ratios in an agate mortar. The weighing was done on an analytical balance (Ohaus DV 215CD) with a high precision of 0.01 mg. As suggested by Diarce et al. [8], a small amount of diethyl ether was used as the solvent to facilitate blending by enhancing solubility of the two components. The mixtures were gently ground by a pestle for ∼1 h to get uniformly mixed samples. Both the pure and mixture sugar alcohol samples were dried in an oven prior to further characterization and tests."
4,Non-isothermal test,"2.3 Non-isothermal test The sugar alcohol samples were first subjected to powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV Rigaku), as illustrated in Fig. 1. The Cu-Kα1,2 radiation source with a wave length of 0.15419 nm was adopted. The XRD patterns were recorded at a step size of 0.02° in the 2θ angular range from 10 to 60°. The measurements were performed at room temperature. The non-isothermal test was carried out on a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Netzsch DSC 200F3) using hermetic aluminum pans with the sample weight being ∼10 mg. The DSC was calibrated using standard samples prior to the tests. The uncertainties of the measured temperature and latent heat of fusion using this DSC are ±0.1 °C and ±0.5%, respectively. The phase-change-related properties, such as melting/crystallization points and latent heats of fusion/crystallization, for the pure and mixture sugar alcohol samples were determined. The onset points on the endothermic and exothermic peaks were identified to be the melting and crystallization points, respectively. In view of the existence of both impurities and polymorphism of some sugar alcohols, e.g., d-mannitol [14–16], the reagents from two sources (with close purities) were characterized for each sample to verify the data consistency. Although some of these phase-change-related properties have been well documented for pure sugar alcohols (including the ones selected in this work), most of the available data were obtained using DSC at a single ramping/cooling rate in an individual study. Therefore, the non-isothermal test in this work was performed at various ramping/cooling rates (up to 10 °C/min), in order to provide benchmark results on the selected pure and mixture sugar alcohols as well as to reveal the effects of ramping/cooling rate on the measured properties. In addition, the recrystallization performance, in relation to the heat retrieval process, was evaluated by conducting consecutive melting/crystallization cycles (see Fig. 1). Parallel tests were performed on three individual specimens of each sample to ensure data reproducibility."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Pure sugar alcohols,"3.1 Pure sugar alcohols As listed in Table 2 , the melting/crystallization points and latent heats of fusion/crystallization of the six pre-screened pure sugar alcohols were measured by DSC at a representative ramping/cooling rate of 5 °C/min, and the materials are listed with increasing the melting point. In general, a fairly good agreement can be seen between the measured values of the samples from two sources. Most of the deviations of the melting/crystallization points are below 0.5 °C. The largest difference is found to be 2.0–2.6 °C for the melting point of d-sorbitol. Similarly, the largest difference in latent heat of fusion is also found for d-sorbitol, which is as high as 20.4 J/g. This is likely attributed to the polymorphism of the raw materials. Actually, d-sorbitol could crystallize to seven different polymorphic forms, with the melting point varying from 47 °C to 100 °C and the latent heat of fusion varying from 160 J/g to 188 J/g [17]. The largest difference in the latent heat of crystallization is found for erythritol (15.5 J/g), although there is an excellent agreement for its melting point and latent heat of fusion. The melting points of these six sugar alcohols cover a wide range from ∼90 °C to ∼225 °C, thereby matching the target low-to-medium temperature for waste heat recovery of some industrial processes, for example the manufacture of plastic and rubber as well as the cement production [1]. The melting points reported here for all six sugar alcohols are in good consistency with the respective documented values (without identifying onset or peak) in available literature [7,18–21]. As compared to paraffins and water, sugar alcohols have a relatively high density in both solid (1.5–1.8 g/cm3) and liquid phases (1.3–1.4 g/cm3) [22], which contributes to their high heat storage density. In accordance to the documented values [6,7], erythritol and d-dulcitol exhibit pretty high latent heats of fusion >330 J/g. However, it should be noted that the crystallization-related quantities were not available for both xylitol and d-sorbitol (with the two lowest melting points below 100 °C) because they were unable to crystallize during cool-down no matter what was the cooling rate. Attention should also be paid to two obvious facts with respect to crystallization. First, although the four sugar alcohols with higher melting points above 100 °C are crystallizable, their crystallization points are much lower than the respective melting points by up to ∼100 °C (for erythritol), indicating the presence of severe supercooling. Secondly, in company with the supercooling effect, the latent heats of crystallization are also found to be much lower than the respective latent heats of fusion by up to ∼150 J/g (for erythritol too). The foregoing observations on the phenomena of non-crystallization and supercooling will be discussed later with the aid of DSC curves. The measured properties of the four crystallizable sugar alcohols at different ramping/cooling rates are listed in Table 3 . Relevant data from available literature are also presented for comparison. The results from an individual supplier for each sugar alcohol are presented in this table, because the ramping/cooling rate dependence is nearly identical between the results from two sources. It is shown that the melting points are nearly independent of the ramping rate for all sugar alcohols. An excellent agreement is seen between the measured onset melting points and the documented results in the literature at the corresponding ramping rates [25,26]. However, the latent heats of fusion increase slightly with increasing the ramping rate for the three linear chain sugar alcohols. The latent heat of fusion is an inherent property of substances, but its measured values could be affected by the measurement method. The DSC method adopted is a transient approach, where the use of a higher ramping rate will cause slight drift of the baseline. As a result, the calculated integral area under the endothermic peak on a DSC heating curve, which represents the latent heat of fusion, may become larger [27]. However, an exception is found for the cyclic chain sugar alcohol, i.e., inositol, whose measured latent heat of fusion is almost unvaried with increasing the ramping rate. Moreover, considerable discrepancies are found for the measured latent heats of fusion in comparison to the scattered documented data with a wide range up to ∼70 J/g (for d-mannitol). As expected, the measured data points are relatively rare for the crystallization process (see Table 3). There are even no such data available for inositol, to the best of our knowledge. The measured crystallization points and latent heats of crystallization are found to strongly depend on the cooling rate. The melting and crystallization behaviors of the pre-screened sugar alcohols are further analyzed with the DSC thermograms for two consecutive tests, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . In view of the good data reproducibility, only representative curves obtained from a single test on an individual sample are presented for each sugar alcohol. First, the non-crystallization of both xylitol and d-sorbitol can be observed intuitively in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Upon heating the as-received crystalline powders, endothermic peaks appear on the curves. However, during the subsequent cool-down process, there is an absence of exothermic peaks, even if the temperature decreases to as low as 0 °C. By further decreasing the temperature to below the glass transition point, e.g., −24.0 °C for xylitol, vitrification occurs as indicated by a change in the specific heat capacity. This change for xylitol was found to be ∼1.05 J/gK at the cooling rate of 5 °C/min, which agrees well with the literature value [28]. Because the vitrification phenomenon was not the main objective of the present work, the DCS results at lower temperatures embracing the glass transition points are not included in Fig. 2. During the consecutive reheating process on the supercooled liquid xylitol and d-sorbitol, there are no endothermic peaks due to the absence of solid−liquid phase transitions. Consequently, no exothermic peaks are expected to see for the second cool-down process. Consecutive tests up to three times were actually performed, and the results of the third run were found to be similar to those of the second run. Hence, the results of the third run are not included in Fig. 2 for the sake of simplicity. The recrystallization test results confirm that both xylitol and d-sorbitol remain as supercooled liquids during cool-down, instead of recrystallize from their melt, even if the cooling rate applied is as low as 0.5 °C/min. Such non-crystallization behavior is deemed to arise from the specific rotameric conformation of xylitol and d-sorbitol. As manifested by Diogo et al. [29], xylitol shows, among various pentitol isomers, the strongest resistance to crystallization due to its conformation-induced slow molecular mobility (i.e., large activation energy) and high degree of cooperativity of molecular motions. Brancato et al. [30] also reported that both xylitol and d-sorbitol cannot recrystallize, but tend to form amorphous metastable phase during cool-down. The difficulty in recrystallization must be addressed before these two sugar alcohols can be utilized for latent heat storage. Some techniques, like the addition of crystalline seeds [31] and the application of mechanical, thermal or electrical shocks [32], may be applicable to the activation of recrystallization of xylitol and d-sorbitol. Both the endothermic and exothermic peaks appear for the consecutive tests on the other four sugar alcohols, as shown in Fig. 2c to f, confirming that they are recrystallizable during the cool-down process. Hence, a cyclic operation of heat storage and retrieval could be built using these sugar alcohols as the PCMs. However, the long distance between the endothermic and exothermic peaks for each sugar alcohols clearly indicates the presence of severe supercooling. The supercooling degree was determined by (6) Δ T sup = T m − T c , where T m and T c are the melting and crystallization points of a given sample, respectively. As presented in Table 3, the supercooling degrees could reach up to ∼89 °C, ∼48 °C, ∼66 °C, and ∼38 °C for erythritol, d-mannitol, d-dulcitol, and inositol, respectively, at the cooling rate of 0.5 °C/min. The supercooling degree strongly depends on the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds in sugar alcohols. The breaking of the hydrogen bonds upon melting takes place at a higher energy than that for the reformation of the bonds during cooling [33], thus leading to serious supercooling of sugar alcohols. It is also shown that both the crystallization points and supercooling degrees strongly depend on the cooling rate, because the cooling strategy and conditions, including the size of the sample, the presence of crystalline seeds (in the sample or from the container wall), and the cooling rate as well, have great impact on the occurrence of an appreciable nucleation rate (i.e., crystallization) upon cooling. The crystallization points exhibit a general decreasing trend with raising the cooling rate, thus leading to an increasing trend of the supercooling degrees. The supercooling degree of some sugar alcohols has been measured and documented. For instance, Ona et al. [34] investigated the crystallization behavior of erythritol by natural cooling of its melt that was preheated to 120 °C. It was found that recrystallization starts to occur until the temperature drops to 61 °C, thus leading to a supercooling degree of 59 °C. The supercooling degree of d-dulcitol was determined to be ∼31 °C by cooling its melt from 240 °C to ∼60 °C through forced convection induced by an electric fan [35]. However, it is noted that the reported supercooling degrees of both erythritol and d-dulcitol are much lower than those determined by the non-isothermal DSC test in the present study. In real applications, however, a PCM may undergo heating/cooling at constant temperatures for cyclic latent heat storage/retrieval, resembling the isothermal test condition with a low cooling rate, which is the main objective of the complementary work in part (II). Suppression of the supercooling degrees of sugar alcohols has to be sought for achieving controllable heat retrieval performance by introducing nucleation additives [24,36] or microencapsulation of the PCMs [23,37]. In addition to the serious supercooling effect, it has also been found that the latent heats of crystallization of these four crystallizable sugar alcohols are far lower than those of their respective latent heats of fusion, due to the incomplete recrystallization. There is a clear dependence of latent heats of crystallization on the cooling rate for the four crystallizable sugar alcohols. A higher latent heat of crystallization, corresponding to a higher degree of crystallinity, can be obtained at a lower cooling rate because the molecules in the melt could have more time to migrate and rearrange, thus being able to form more crystalline structures. As shown in Table 3, the measured crystallization points and latent heats of crystallization exhibit significant deviations from the literature values for many cases. The measured properties in this work may serve as a benchmark database for reference."
7,Binary eutectic mixtures,"3.2 Binary eutectic mixtures Prior to presentation of the non-isothermal test results on the binary eutectic mixtures, the XRD diffractograms of the pure and mixture sugar alcohols are analyzed. As representative examples, only the results of xylitol, d-sorbitol, erythritol and their binary eutectic mixtures are plotted in Fig. 3 . The diffraction peaks of the pure sugar alcohols are in excellent agreement with the standard patterns as well as the results reported in previous studies [10,38]. It is also clear that the diffraction peaks of a binary eutectic mixture represent the superposition of the patterns of each component, suggesting that no new compounds were created during the preparation of these mixture sugar alcohols. The measured melting points and latent heats of fusion, at a ramping rate of 5 °C/min, of the total of 15 binary eutectic mixtures are listed in Table 4 , where the mixtures are ordered with increasing the melting point. Also included are the rare data points from available literature. The measured melting points of the mixture sugar alcohols are in good agreement with those predicted using the thermodynamic model. The deviations between the predicted and measured results of almost all binary systems are <1 °C, thus confirming the formation of eutectic mixtures at the calculated molar ratios. However, the thermodynamic model appears to overestimate the latent heat of fusion of eutectic mixtures, because the effect of hydrogen bonds and specific heat capacity were both neglected [6]. Similar to the pure sugar alcohols, the measured melting points exhibit good consistency (<2 °C) between the two sets of samples prepared by raw materials from different sources, whereas more remarkable differences, e.g., ∼32 J/g for the mixture of xylitol (75 mol%) + erythritol, are observed for the measured latent heats of fusion. There is an agreement between the measured melting points and the documented values for 11 mixtures. However, the latent heats of fusion are only available for four of them, and considerable discrepancies are observed against the measured results of the present work. The greatest deviation of nearly 70 J/g is again found for the mixture of xylitol (75 mol%) + erythritol. As mentioned, preparation of binary eutectic mixtures is an approach to manipulation of the melting points of natural sugar alcohols. As shown in Table 4, the melting points of the 15 binary eutectic mixtures make up a spectrum from ∼70 °C to ∼180 °C, leading to (a) a great extension of the number of candidate PCMs in this temperature range and (b) the availability of five mixture sugar alcohols with melting points below 93 °C (i.e., the melting point of xylitol). The nine mixtures containing either xylitol or d-sorbitol possess melting points below 100 °C, and the lowest melting point of ∼73 °C was obtained for the mixture of xylitol (52 mol%) + d-sorbitol that has a decent latent heat of fusion of ∼179 J/g. This mixture has been proposed and studied by Diarce et al. [8], although the reported melting point (∼67 °C) and latent heat of fusion (∼170 J/g) exhibit slight differences with the present results. Since d-sorbitol itself has a relatively low latent heat of fusion, the five mixtures containing d-sorbitol all possess a latent heat of fusion below 180 J/g. On the contrary, the other mixtures containing xylitol are more promising due to their greater latent heats of fusion above 200 J/g, except for the mixture of xylitol (96 mol%) + d-mannitol. In addition, without involving either xylitol or d-sorbitol as a component, the other six mixtures all possess melting points above 110 °C and relatively high latent heats of fusion above 270 J/g, making them potential candidates for this medium temperature range. It is noted that a lower latent heat of fusion is obtained, in relative to each of the pure components, for all eutectic mixtures because of the reduced hydrogen bond energy. As analyzed theoretically by Wang et al. [39], the formation of a eutectic mixture will cause change of the hydrogen bond length among hybrid molecules of two polyalcohols. In addition to the increase in deformed hydrogen bonds, the probability for the number of hydrogen bonds that are easy to break down also increases. Therefore, the hydrogen bond energy becomes smaller in eutectic mixture sugar alcohols, leading to the decrease in latent heat of fusion. In addition, there are eight binary eutectic mixtures containing one component at very low concentrations (≤5 mol%). From the thermodynamic model of binary eutectic systems, it is expected that the melting points of these mixture sugar alcohols remain close to those of the respective major components. For instance, the mixture of xylitol (99 mol%) + d-dulcitol was measured to have a melting point of ∼92.8 °C, which is nearly identical to that of xylitol (∼93.4 °C). However, the latent heat of fusion of this mixture was measured to be only ∼220 J/g, which becomes lower than that of xylitol (∼230 J/g). In that sense, it is unnecessary to make these mixtures because their respective major components are better options in the target temperature ranges. The DSC thermograms of two consecutive tests on the nine binary eutectic mixtures containing either xylitol or d-sorbitol, i.e., the two incrystallizable sugar alcohols identified before, are presented in Fig. 4 . The formation of eutectic mixtures is first verified by the presence of single endothermic peaks. Multiple peaks would have otherwise been observed if the binary mixtures are not eutectics. The DSC curves of these mixtures exhibit similar patterns, which are also similar to those of pure xylitol and d-sorbitol (see Fig. 2a and b, respectively). Both the endothermic and exothermic peaks disappear on the curves for the second runs. This indicates that all the mixtures containing either xylitol or d-sorbitol are also unable to crystallize during cool-down, but remain in the form of metastable supercooled liquid as a result of the large activation energy for migration of molecules [29]. Based on the melting behaviors, many of these mixture sugar alcohols have been proposed to have a great potential for latent heat storage between 70 °C and 100 °C. However, the non-crystallization during cooling poses a serious problem for the application of these low-temperature mixture sugar alcohols because a PCM must be operated cyclically for heat storage and retrieval. The DSC curves for other four binary eutectic mixtures with higher melting points: i.e., erythritol (84 mol%) + d-mannitol, erythritol (95 mol%) + d-dulcitol, erythritol (96 mol%) + inositol and d-dulcitol (69 mol%) + inositol, are presented in Fig. 5 , because they exhibit similar melting and crystallization behaviors. Although the four components, i.e., erythritol, d-mannitol, d-dulcitol and inositol, are all crystallizable, these four mixtures are not able to crystallize as indicated by the absence of exothermic peaks on the first cooling curves. Unlike the observations in Fig. 4, it is interesting that the endothermic peaks appear on the second heating curves, due to the presence of secondary exothermic peaks prior to these primary endothermic peaks. The exothermic peak appears at ∼70 °C for the mixture of erythritol (84 mol%) + d-mannitol system and at ∼80 °C for other three mixtures. Although these four mixtures are unable to crystallize from the melt upon cooling, they experience cold crystallization during the reheating process, which mainly stems from the high viscosity of the supercooled liquids of the mixture sugar alcohols [29,40]. The viscosities of mixture sugar alcohols exhibited orders of magnitude increase of up to 100–1000 Pas near their crystallization points, in comparison to their pure counterparts [32]. It is understood that the crystallization of a PCM can be suppressed significantly by a high viscosity, because it reduces the molecular mobility as well as hinders the rearrangement of crystal lattices in the supercooled liquid PCM. During the subsequent reheating process, due to the viscosity decrease, the molecular mobility is improved to facilitate crystal growth, thus leading to the occurrence of cold crystallization (as indicated by the presence of an unusual exothermic peak on the heating curve). However, except for the mixture of d-dulcitol (69 mol%) + inositol, the areas under the secondary exothermic peaks are much smaller than those under the respective primary endothermic peaks, indicating that the stored latent heat cannot be fully retrieved during cold crystallization. The DSC curves of the last two binary eutectic mixtures, i.e., d-mannitol (70 mol%) + d-dulcitol and d-mannitol (82 mol%) + inositol, are presented in Fig. 6 , as they appear to be the only two mixtures that exhibit desirable recrystallization performance. In comparison to the DSC curves for pure d-mannitol and d-dulcitol, the mixture of d-mannitol (70 mol%) + d-dulcitol shows a much shorter and wider exothermic peak during cool-down, which implies that the crystallization rate becomes lower for the eutectic mixture. The crystallization-related properties of these two mixtures are listed in Table 5 , where the data consistency is clearly confirmed. The effects of melting/cooling rate on the measured properties are shown in Table 6 . Similar to the pure sugar alcohols (see Table 3), the melting points of both mixtures are nearly independent of the ramping rate, whereas the peak melting points increase slightly with increasing the ramping rate. The ramping rate also has a negligible influence on the measured latent heats of fusion of both mixtures. However, the measured onset and peak crystallization points and latent heats of crystallization exhibit a clear decreasing trend with increasing the cooling rate. The mixture of d-mannitol (70 mol%) + d-dulcitol has been well characterized by Paul et al. [7], and their results show a good agreement with the present data in almost all of the properties except for the latent heat of crystallization. In contrast, another mixture of d-mannitol (82 mol%) + inositol has not yet been characterized systematically. There is only a single point available for the melting point as measured at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min [6]. The large differences between the measured crystallization points and the respective melting points of both mixtures clearly indicate the presence of significant supercooling, like the two components behave (see Table 3). The cooling-rate-dependent supercooling degrees are listed in Table 6. As expected, the supercooling degrees of both mixtures become higher with increasing the cooling rate. For the mixture of d-mannitol (70 mol%) + d-dulcitol, the measured supercooling degrees at the various cooling rates are in good agreement with the data reported by Paul et al. [7]. Although there are no reference data available, the supercooling degree of the mixture of d-mannitol (82 mol%) + inositol has a slightly more pronounced rising trend upon increasing the cooling rate."
8,Screening results,"3.3 Screening results Having revealed by Figs. 4 to 6, the recrystallization performance of the total of 21 sugar alcohols (6 pure + 15 mixture) can be categorized into three groups, i.e., incrystallizable, cold crystallization, and crystallizable. An intuitive summary of such categorization is displayed in Fig. 7 , where the horizontal and vertical axes are arranged with increasing latent heat of fusion and increasing melting point, respectively. Each intersection box of two distinct materials represents the binary eutectic mixture of them. Xylitol, d-sorbitol and the nine binary eutectic mixtures containing at least one of both are unable to crystallize from their melt by cooling. Four binary eutectic mixtures experience cold crystallization during reheating, although they cannot crystallize upon cooling as well. Only the four high-temperature sugar alcohols, i.e., erythritol, d-mannitol, d-dulcitol, and inositol, and two mixtures of d-mannitol (70 mol%) + d-dulcitol and d-mannitol (82 mol%) + inositol were found to be able to crystallizable during cool-down. However, these six pure or mixture sugar alcohols face serious supercooling. Another drawing that summarizes the advanced screening results is displayed in Fig. 8 , where conventional PCMs from other kinds of materials are included for comparison. The entire temperature spectrum can be divided into two regions: i.e., low temperature region below 100 °C and medium temperature region between 100 °C and 250 °C. As mentioned, xylitol, d-sorbitol and the nine binary eutectic mixtures containing at least one of both all lie in the low temperature region, and they all suffer from the difficulty in non-crystallization. In fact, even if these low temperature sugar alcohols do not face crystallization problem, they may not be the best option in this temperature range because the latent heat of fusion is only up to 240 J/g. Better candidates, with higher latent heat of fusion, from other types of materials are available. For example, the organic PCM eicosanoic with a melting point of ∼74 °C [41] can readily be used to replace the mixture of xylitol (52 mol%) + d-sorbitol, because the former has a much greater latent heat of fusion (∼227 J/g), as listed in Table 7 . Going up for several degrees in Fig. 8, a better option can be found at ∼78 °C for the inexpensive inorganic PCM Ba(OH)2·8H2O, which has a high latent heat of fusion of ∼280 J/g [42]. However, all of the sugar alcohols studied in the medium temperature range are deemed to be potential candidates due to their desirably high latent heats of fusion (all above 250 J/g), except for the four binary eutectic mixtures that are not crystallizable. Among them, erythritol and d-dulcitol stand out particularly for their very high latent heats of fusion above 330 J/g, comparable to that of water (as denoted by the dashed line in Fig. 8). According to a previous theoretical work [45], the latent heat of fusion of non-natural sugar alcohols have a potential to reach 450–500 J/g by special molecular design. Although other PCMs are available in this temperature range, they rarely have comparable storage density with the sugar alcohols. For instance, the inexpensive inorganic PCM MgCl2·6H2O has a melting point (∼117 °C [43]) close to that of erythritol, but its latent heat of fusion is ∼169 J/g, only a half of that of erythritol. Although the latent heat of fusion of inositol (∼260 J/g) is not that high as compared to erythritol and d-dulcitol, it might not be replaceable by other PCMs around the temperature of 225 °C. As shown in Fig. 8, the binary salt mixture of NaNO3 (64 mol%) + KNO3, with a melting point of ∼223 °C, only possesses a low latent heat of fusion of ∼142 J/g [46]. In addition, the two crystallizable sugar alcohols mixtures, i.e., d-mannitol (70 mol%) + d-dulcitol and d-dulcitol (69 mol%) + inositol, have similar melting points (within the range of 150–160 °C) and decent latent heats of fusion (∼270 J/g). However, at this temperature range, an alternative candidate is found, i.e., the organic PCM adipic acid with a melting point of 152 °C [42]. Although it does not provide a higher latent heat of fusion, the adipic acid seems to be a better option because it is even less expensive (see Table 7) and has insignificant supercooling. Based on the foregoing analysis, it can be concluded that the 15 binary eutectic mixture sugar alcohols studied in this work all have their own problems. Therefore, it may not worth making eutectic mixtures, although this is deemed to be an effective way of manipulating the melting points of sugar alcohols."
9,Conclusions,"After analyzing the non-isothermal test results on the total of 21 pure and binary eutectic mixture sugar alcohols, some concluding remarks can be drawn as follows: (1) The two sugar alcohols with the lowest melting points below 100 °C, i.e., xylitol and d-sorbitol, and the nine binary eutectic mixtures containing at least one of both are unable to crystallize. The difficulty in crystallization makes them useless for practical applications. (2) Four mixtures of erythritol (84 mol%) + d-mannitol, erythritol (95 mol%) + d-dulcitol, erythritol (96 mol%) + inositol, and d-dulcitol (69 mol%) + inositol are also unable to crystallize. Instead, they experience cold crystallization during reheating from the supercooled liquid state. However, the stored latent heat cannot be fully retrieved by cold crystallization. (3) The rest four sugar alcohols with higher melting points ranging from 119 °C to 225 °C, i.e., erythritol, d-mannitol, d-dulcitol, inositol, and the rest two mixtures, i.e., d-mannitol (70 mol%) + d-dulcitol and d-mannitol (82 mol%) + inositol, are crystallizable. However, they all suffer from serious supercooling (e.g., up to 100 °C for erythritol). (4) The latent heats of fusion of the low-temperature sugar alcohols, i.e., xylitol, d-sorbitol and their derived eutectic mixtures, are not high enough (<240 J/g) to merit their utilization, as compared to other PCMs with a similar melting point (for example Ba(OH)2·8H2O). (5) The six crystallizable pure and mixture sugar alcohols are deemed to be potential candidates if the serious issue of supercooling can be addressed, especially for erythritol and d-dulcitol that have very high latent heats of fusion above 330 J/g, in the medium temperature range. (6) The underlying mechanisms that govern the crystallization behaviors of sugar alcohols remain unclear. The understanding and control of crystallization behaviors, in terms of the molecular structures as well as intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, would be of great interest in future studies. (7) The measured properties of these sugar alcohols in this work can serve as benchmark database. However, a PCM is usually heated/cooled at constant temperatures in practice, rather than at constant ramping/cooling rates. Therefore, the melting and crystallization behaviors will be further evaluated by isothermal test in the complementary work part (II)."
