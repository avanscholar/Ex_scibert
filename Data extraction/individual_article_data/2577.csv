0,Introduction,"The rise in global energy demand and environmental protection issues are mainly associated with fossil fuel consumption. To cope up with the energy demand, alternatives routes are being researched extensively in the last decades. Therefore, renewable energy has become an integral part of energy density as it can be another ideal energy source for producing important chemical intermediates from renewable sources. The production of value-added chemicals from renewable energy especially biomass are becoming major attention and need to be investigated as it can reduce the dependency on petroleum products as there is a dwindling in the number of fossil fuels [1]. Among all the renewable energy technologies, hydrogen production has emerged as one of the most attractive and clean energy fuels. Hydrogen can be produced renewable way from biomass-derived oxygenates by partial oxidation, autothermal reforming, steam reforming and aqueous phase reforming and supercritical water gasification. Among the other reforming technologies, aqueous phase reforming (APR) is the technology that distinct interests in providing an economic process and reduced the formation of CO2. In 2002, Dumesic and his colleagues [2] discovered a novel technology called aqueous phase reforming (APR). APR is a promising and reliable technology to be explored, as it is effective energetically in term of its operating requirements. In APR, biomass-derived oxygenates undergo a catalytic transformation process where hydrogen and hydrocarbons are produced. Considerable renewable oxygenates have been utilized for the APR technique including ethylene glycol, sorbitol, glucose, ethanol and glycerol [3]. Sorbitol (C6H14O6) is a type of polyhydric alcohol which is produced by the reduction of glucose. Whereas glycerol is the main by-product from biodiesel production that continues to grow in the main consumer market. The glycerol produced can be utilized as a resource to produce hydrogen that is used in many processes in the chemical industry [4]. Besides hydrogen, there are many other values added chemicals that can be produced from the reforming of glycerol and sorbitol [5,6]. An encouraging approach to obtain value-added chemicals is through aqueous phase reforming [7,8] with numerous advantages such as a neutral CO2 process for generating hydrogen at relatively low temperature (between 220 and 260 °C) and can be done only in a single-step reaction. Moreover, only a small amount of carbon monoxide (CO) produces through the APR because of water-gas shift reaction (WGS) reaction is favourable in this process [2]. Also, APR is more efficient in energy usage compare to other reforming technologies like vapour phase steam-reforming because there is no need for high temperature to volatilize the water in the process. APR also minimized the undesirable reaction of carbohydrates decomposition that usually occur in other biomass conversion reaction because of the highly elevated temperature [2,9]. Major aspects in which APR has advantages, firstly, the process can be applied either for water-soluble or wet feedstock and secondly, the low operating temperature. Primarily, all these conditions prohibit the evaporation of water [3]. Several studies had been made on APR for hydrogen production [10–12] nevertheless, the operating conditions (temperature and pressure) of the APR reaction instigate other competitive side reactions such as CO2 methanation that ultimately lowers the overall H2 yield [13]. Likewise, in the presence of H2 during the APR over a bifunctional catalyst (metal + acid sites), reactions such as aqueous phase dehydration/hydrogenation results in alkanes production [14–16]. Therefore, instead of only tackling the way to overcome the H2 problems of APR, it is also important to focus on the side reactions or the production of intermediates. Another limitation of aqueous phase reforming is the yield of value-added chemicals greatly depends on the choice of catalyst. Noble metals such as platinum have shown high activity and low deposition of carbon [17]. However, noble metals are expensive and need alternatives. Therefore, transition metals such as nickel, Mo, Co, and Cu are inexpensive and alternatives to platinum [18]. Ni as a catalyst generally promotes the formation of C-C bond cleavage and WGS reaction that is important in the APR process for the production of intermediates. As stated by Haasterecht et al. [18], Ni-based catalysts need acidic support due to frequently deactivation in the reaction process. Some research had shown that the stability of the catalyst at high temperature and pressure can be improved in the presence of a bimetallic catalyst with high activity and less coking deactivation [19]. Molybdenum had been used for the direct synthesis of mixed alcohol from synthesis gas [20]. The advantage of using molybdenum is mainly due to its less sensitivity towards CO2. Hence, the coking can be reduced where the catalyst activity impeded with a high amount of CO2 [20]. Moreover, to promote the formation of value-added chemicals through the APR of sorbitol and glycerol, catalysts with high acidity is required. Acidifying the reaction medium facilitates dehydration and hydrogenation reactions. The addition of acids such as hydrochloric acid or using solid acid supported catalysts have therefore been studied [21–23]. Consequently, zeolites used as high acidic solid acid support as catalysts produces higher selectivity to produce intermediate liquids [24]. Besides, it is proved that a higher selectivity of the intermediate liquids occurred if zeolites are used as the support for the catalysts [25]. Thus, alumina and H-Y zeolite are used in the present study as mild and highly acidic support to investigate the effect of acidity on value-added chemical production. It is important to find the best suitable catalysts along with the synthesis approach of catalysts to execute the APR process. As catalysts design and synthesis plays an important role in the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts. Several methods have been used for the formulation of catalysts such as hydrothermal method, incipient wetness impregnation method, sol-gel method, colloidal method, microemulsion, microwave synthesis and sonochemical method. The sonochemical preparation method is a developing technique for various applications [26–37]. Several catalysts have been utilized for the production of hydrogen using APR, an addition of molybdenum together with nickel helps to promote the formation of value-added chemicals such as propane-1,3-diol, acetone and ethylene glycol by increasing the division of C-O bonds [38]. Likewise, the sonochemical method is chosen to study the dispersion of particles on the surface of the catalysts as the effect of sonication, as it improves the physicochemical of the catalysts [39]. The sonochemical approach has offered the dispersion of particles which lead to favourable catalytic performance as well as the improvement of the specific surface area [40]. Conclusively, the novelty of the present work lies in an introduction of supports (Al2O3 and H-Y zeolite) catalysts co-impregnated with Ni and Mo metals synthesized via sonochemical approach for value-added chemical production from APR of sorbitol and glycerol. There is no reported work for the application of sonochemically synthesized catalysts in APR. In the previous studies of APR, the researchers have focused more on hydrogen production and gaseous products, whereas in this study liquid products are mainly focused. In this study, the liquid products which contain valuable chemicals such as acetone, ethylene glycol 1,3-propanediol and glycerol have been reported from the APR of sorbitol/glycerol. Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) and H-Y zeolite has been chosen as the catalyst support it was observed that Al2O3 supported catalysts are more selective towards the value-added chemicals produced from APR of glycerol which is mainly C2-C3 (acetone, ethylene glycol, propanoic acid). While, H-Y zeolite supported catalysts offered higher selectivity towards the products mainly C3-C4 (1,3-propanediol, butanediol, glycerol) in the result of APR of sorbitol."

3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Overall, six catalysts formulations (10%Ni/Al2O3, 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 5%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite, 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite) were synthesized via sonochemical preparation method adapted from [39,41] in this work. Controlling 10 wt%Ni over supports (HY zeolite/γ-Al2O3) with 0, 1, and 5 wt% doping of Mo. γ-Al2O3 and H-Y zeolite were calcined at 500 ℃ for 4 h before synthesizing of the catalysts to remove impurities and moisture adsorbed. Aqueous solutions of Ni and Mo were prepared with a measured amount of 10 wt% Ni and (0, 1 and 5 wt%) of Mo salts by dissolving their precursor (Ni(NO3)3.6 H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24.4 H2O respectively) in deionized water placed on magnetic stirrer in separate beakers. Later, both Ni and Mo salts solutions were doped over γ-Al2O3/ HY zeolite supports and processed for 30 min on a magnetic stirrer before introduced to ultrasound irradiation with the amplitude of 80%, 90 W, pulse-ON for 20 s and OFF for 10 s by using Q700 Sonica Sonicator. The overall process time for mixing by using the sonicator was 45 min as reported [27,39,41,42]. Later, the heterogeneous catalysts mixtures were dried for 12 h in an oven at 110 ℃ for 24 h and calcinated at 500 ℃ in a nitrogen flow furnace for 4 h.( Figs. 1–2)."
4,Catalyst characterizations,"2.3 Catalyst characterizations All the formulated catalysts were put through characterization technique to determine the physicochemical properties of the synthesized catalysts which can be studied and relate to the performance of the catalysts for the production of value-added chemicals in the aqueous phase reforming of both sorbitol and glycerol. Hydrogen Temperature Programmed Reduction (H2-TPR) analysis (Model: Thermo Scientific TPDRO 1100) was performed to identify the reducible species existence, the interaction between the active phase and support surface, and the intensity of reducibility of each catalyst while Ammonia Temperature Programmed Desorption (NH3-TPD) was done to investigate the acidic properties of the catalysts. To measure the hydrogen consumption in the H2-TPR analysis, 20 mg of each sample was placed in a U-shaped quart reactor where it will be heated in the presence of hydrogen (pre-mixed gases, 5.06 vol% H2 in N2, flowrate of 50 mL/min) with the temperature range of 27–900 °C (5 °C/min ramping). A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to measure continuously the concentration of H2 at the reactor outlet. The same can be done for NH3-TPD by changing the inlet gas which is ammonia. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy-Electron Dispersive X-ray (FESEM-EDX) analysis (Model: VPFESEM, Zeiss Supra55 VP) was carried out to dictate the surface structure of the catalyst and to classify the presence in the catalysts of the elements such as Ni, Si, Al, O and Mo. The dispersion and composition (wt%) of a metal particle on the catalysts can be observed with the help of the dot mapping analysis and Electron Dispersive X-ray (EDX) combined with FESEM. The high-definition images were captured by the bombardment of high accelerated electrons in a high vacuum column onto the samples that had been placed on the carbon-coated disc. The electronic lens captured and transformed the deflected electrons into high-resolution video scan images. Additionally, TGA (Model: Perkin Elmer STA 6000) was performed to study the thermal behaviour, the structure and the weight loss of the catalysts [40]. Calcination temperature for the uncalcined catalyst, composition and thermal stability of catalyst can also be determined from TGA analysis. Weight loss, the structure of the catalysts can also be identified from TGA. With ramping of 10 °C /min the derivative weight % loss of catalysts was recorded with the holding temperature of 900 °C by using 50 mL/min flow rate of airflow. Specific surface area, pore size and pore volume of all the catalysts were evaluated by using specific surface area (SSA) analysis (Model: Micrometrics ASAP 2020 Instrument corp.). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms at the temperature of −195 °C with an automatic volumetric adsorption unit were used to measure the surface area while pore size and pore volume was measured by using the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm corresponding to v-t plot method. The degassing temperature was set at 300 °C for removing the external substances on the surface of catalysts. The specific surface area, pore size, pore volume was calculated by using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method and v-t plot analysis respectively. Lastly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the recently synthesized catalysts were investigated to classify the structure of the phase for the crystalline material and also to categorize the unit cell dimension of the catalyst by using the XRD analyzer (Model: PAN analytical X′pert3 Powder and Empyrean) with the radiation source of Cu Kα (k ¼ 0.154056 nm) operated at 40 kV and 50 mA with the 2θ range of 20–90° for the scanning steps. By comparing the results with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDs), the identification of phase, elements and compounds can be classified. Besides, the average size of crystallites of the catalysts were calculated by using the Debye Scherrer equation: (1) ( D = 0.9 λ / β cos θ ) where; λ = 1.54060 Å, β is the full width at ½ maximum intensity of the peak (in Rad) and θ is the angle at which the peak located at."
5,Aqueous phase reforming,"2.4 Aqueous phase reforming The performance activity of the catalysts was tested by aqueous phase reforming (APR) of sorbitol and glycerol to investigate the type and selectivity of value-added chemicals produced. The reaction was performed in an autoclave reactor (Model: PREMEX Autoclave High-Pressure Reactor MED 778). 10 wt% sorbitol/glycerol solution was prepared by mixing 25 mL of pure sorbitol/glycerol with 225 mL of distilled water. 1 g of catalyst was placed inside the PREMEX Autoclave Reactor. The catalysts were activated at respective temperature by using purified hydrogen at 4 bars for 2 h. The reactor was allowed to cool down for 90 min before 10 wt% sorbitol/glycerol solutions were added into the reactor and run at 230 °C, 20 bar of nitrogen gas and 450 rpm of stirring [41]. The liquid product was collected in a sample bottle after 60 min and qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis After aqueous phase reforming of sorbitol/glycerol, the reaction intermediates in the liquid sample were qualitatively analyzed by using the GC-MS (Shimadzu-GC-MS-QP2020 with DB-5 column), analytical column dimension of 20 m × 0.15 mm × 0.15 µm. The program was set up by the following parameters: split ratio 1:100, injector temperature of 275 °C, and 0.2 µL injection volume. Helium with a flow of 1 mL/min was used as a carrier. The column temperature was set up as below: isothermally set 35 °C for 3 min and then increased by a direct gradient of 3 °C/min to 90 °C and then 10 °C/min to 380 °C, before lastly kept without changing the temperature at 380 °C for 5 min 200 °C is the set MS detector temperature for the ion source electron impact ionization (EI+: electron energy of 70 eV, mass range m/z of 30–45, the scanning rate of 3 scan/s). The quantitative analysis of the identified value-added chemicals was determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using prepared standards, consisted of an Agilent ZORBEX Eclipse XDB C18 column equipped with UV–VIS detector and with the analytical column dimension of 150 m × 2.1 mm× 5 µm. H2SO4 with a flow of 1 mL/min and injection volume of 100 µL was used as the mobile phase. The column oven temperature is set at 35 °C and UV–VIS set at 215 nm was used as the detector. The percentage area was determined, and the concentration of each substance was calculated to find conversion of sorbitol/glycerol to liquid products, the selectivity of liquid products, the yield of products and carbon balance by using Eqs. (2)–(4) and (5): (2) Sorbitol / GlycerolConversion ( % ) = 1 − C sorb / gly 0 C sorb / gly × 100 where C°sorb/gly is the final concentration of sorbitol/glycerol in the liquid product and Csorb/gly is the initial concentration of sorbitol/glycerol before reaction. (3) Selectivity of productX ( % ) = C D C U × 100 where CD is the concentration of the desired product and CU is the total concentration of the undesired products. (4) Yield ( % ) = C D C T where CX is the concentration of the desired product and CT is the total concentration of all the products. (5) C balance = 100 − moloffeed × n in − ∑ ( mol C i × n ) out ( moloffeed × n ) in × 100 where n is the number of C atoms in the molecule and Ci is the products produced during the APR of sorbitol/glycerol."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Phase and crystallite size of the catalysts To determine the structure and phase of the metal oxides present, the catalysts are tested in X-ray diffraction (XRD) assessment. Fig. 3 shows the results for XRD for Al2O3, 10%Ni/Al2O3, 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 5%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, H-Y zeolite, 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite, 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite. Based on the XRD diffraction plot in Fig. 3(a), it can be observed that Al2O3 peak was prominent at an angle of 2θ, 37°, 46° and 67° (JCPDS-29–0063) and observed to be cubic shaped and the broad peak indicates the large size of Al2O3. While the peak for cubic shaped NiO, the metal catalyst can be detected at an angle of 2θ, 37°, 43° and 65° in the figure (JCPDS-47–1048) [27,43]. The NiO peaks in the HY zeolite supported catalysts were less obvious compare to the alumina supported catalysts because Ni metals were highly incorporated into the HY zeolite [44,45]. The presence of NiO peak confirmed that the calcination of the catalysts was able to decompose Ni(NO)3 to become NiO as proven by the Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) results. Ameen et al. [27] reported in their study that by applying the sonochemical method during the synthesis, the NiO shape is highly possible to be modified into multiple other structures such as tetragonal (JCPDS-00–20–0776) and monoclinic (JCPDS-20–07777). Also, the H-Y zeolite was found to be identical with the previous study [24,44,46,47] which can be observed in Fig. 3(b). The addition of Mo to the catalysts show the peaks for MoO3 at 25.8° in the XRD patterns (JCPDS-05–0508) [28] for both sample 10% Ni/Al2O3 and sample 10% Ni/H-Y zeolite. By doping Mo over the Ni supported catalysts, there are new peaks presence and the intensity of the peaks for both supports of the catalysts decreased. The reduction in the intensity of the peaks indicates the retention of the structure of the Al2O3 and H-Y zeolite framework. The peaks found in Ni/H-Y zeolite catalysts have higher intensity and are sharper than the peaks of Ni/Al2O3 indicating that catalysts on H-Y zeolite are more crystalline than catalysts with alumina support[27]. Crystallinity can be defined as the constructional order of atoms or molecules in their solid-state. High crystallinity is often an indication of greater catalytic activity and also superior characteristic of the catalyst in term of stability, dispersion and solidity [48]. These results can be confirmed by the FESEM, SSA and TPR analysis. The average crystalline sizes for the catalysts were also calculated by applying Scherrer’s equation in the XRD graph analysis and the values were depicted in Table 1. The crystallite size for 10%Ni/Al2O3, 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 5%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3 are 5.15 nm, 5.47 nm and 6.26 nm while the size of 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite, 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite are 13.9 nm, 16.7 nm and 27.9 nm respectively. The large average crystallite size of the Ni supported on H-Y zeolite is probably due to the three-dimensional tetrahedral framework of Al2O3-SiO2 which consist of the zeolite crystal structure. The lower crystallite structure of these catalysts that had been sonochemically synthesized compared to the other same type of catalysts is mainly due to the ultrasound irradiation which might affect the size of the crystallite by producing huge energy of ultrasound waves, which not only helped in term of the precursor homogenous dispersion on the surface of the catalyst but also assisted precursor in penetrating the pores [27,30]. Pore size and pore volume were improved due to ultrasound irradiations, where the increased size of pores also contributed to enhance the surface of the catalysts [30]. 3.1.2 Structural properties of the catalyst Table 1 shows the average surface area, pore volume and pore size of various catalysts for the specific surface area (SSA) analysis. It was observed that the surface area of H-Y zeolite support was significantly higher than catalysts with alumina support after synthesizing the metal-doped catalysts using similar metal oxide composition. The higher surface area generally provides more active sites and feasible for the adsorption and desorption process of the reaction and product over the surface of the catalysts in reaction, ultimately increases the activity of the catalysts. H-Y zeolites supported catalysts showed better performances during the reaction where it showed higher selectivity towards the products and also observed with higher conversion mainly due to the surface area of the catalysts. Based on the result gotten, it is ascertained that the addition of Ni and Mo lessens the surface area and pore volume nevertheless increases pore size. The surface area and pore volume decrease due to the covering of metal particles over the support [42,43] where it can be proved at 5% addition of Mo for both supports, the surface area decreases significantly. Thus, the addition of metal on the catalyst needs to be considered carefully as higher metal loading generally block the pores of the catalysts consequently decrease the surface area for the reaction and also the effect of ultrasound irradiation is more prominent towards lower metal loading as reported [27,28]. Next, it is common to observe the decrease in pore size as the metal loading increases nonetheless as reported by Ameen [27], the sonochemically-synthesized catalyst showed a different trend for the pore size, it increased as the percentage of metal loading increases. This statement can be confirmed by the XRD analysis where the precursor structure may change and thus increase the pore size of the catalysts. The increased pore size provides more surface area and space for the catalytic activity to occurred hence give better performance during the reaction. 3.1.3 Surface morphological of the catalyst Fig. 4 shows the surface morphology of 10%Ni/Al2O3, 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 5%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, while Fig. 5 shows 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite, 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite catalysts at 30,000 × magnification with a scale of 200 nm obtained from FESEM with EDX and dot-mapping. NiO particles can be observed to be cubic shaped and homogenously dispersed on the surface of supports from the images of FESEM results. It can also be observed that impregnation of NiO do not greatly disturbed or changed the structure of the supports [49]. Nevertheless, higher metal loading of Ni and Mo on catalysts may block some of the pores of the catalysts as shown in the images, it can be noticed that fewer dark areas (which indicates the pores) were available that resulted in a decrease of surface area and pore volume as proven in SSA analysis. FESEM results indicate that the catalysts supported by H-Y zeolite formed octahedron crystal which is more distinguished compared to catalysts with alumina support i.e., amorphous. Fig. 5 supports the XRD results where H-Y zeolite support catalysts give high-intensity peaks compared to alumina support catalysts which indicate that Ni/H-Y zeolite catalysts are more crystalline and define in shape. The higher the crystallinity the higher the surface area hence the more active site available for the reaction. It is also evident from the FESEM images that H-Y zeolite supported catalysts have more surface area because of the shape and structure compared to the Al2O3 supported catalysts which can be supported from the SSA results where H-Y zeolite catalysts give seven times more surface area compared to alumina supported catalysts. Furthermore, catalysts having higher crystallinity can be recycled compared to the lower crystallinity of the catalysts due to their relatively stable framework as reported [48]. From the FESEM images in Figs. 4 and 5, it can be seen that molybdenum metal particles are deposited on the support as doped on the catalyst in addition to the 10% nickel metal. The homogenous particles dispersion of Ni over the alumina and zeolite supports can be observed from the dot-mapping images. Moreover, all of the elements present in the catalysts had been verified from the EDX spectra i.e., Ni, Al, O and Mo in the Ni/Al2O3 catalysts and Ni, Al, Si, O and Mo in Ni/H-Y zeolite catalysts. 3.1.4 Temperature programmed analysis Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) analysis was performed to figure the reducible species presence and degree of reducibility in hydrogen. The plots of 10%Ni/Al2O3, 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 5%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite, 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite is shown in Fig. 6. There is more than one peak for all the catalysts where the first peak indicates the reduction of weakly interaction of metals oxide with the supports and also the bulk reduction of NiO to Ni [50,51] while the second peak represents the reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 [27,50] and the third peak represents the reduction of NiAlO4 and NiMoAlO4 [27]. The strength of the interaction between the active metal oxide and support with their reduction pattern can be determined from the intensity of the peaks on the TPR graph. A higher degree of reduction of any particular species can be related to their high intensity at any correlative temperature [52,53]. Catalysts with good uniformity, dispersion and strong metal-support interaction can also be determined from the high magnitude of their peak as shown by the H-Y zeolite supported catalysts from the TPR plots. Moreover, the lower reduction temperature for the catalysts with the H-Y zeolite supports is also because the dispersion of the particles is more prominent compare to Al2O3 supported catalysts. These statements can be demonstrated from the FESEM and XRD results. Additionally, Ni/Al2O3 have broad peaks compared to Ni/H-Y zeolite which has sharp peaks as shown in the TPR curve that indicates that Ni has strong binding energy with Al2O3 with a greater particle size of NiOx. Reduction temperature is mainly correlating to the metal and support interaction. Particles with low metal support interaction are easy to reduce as these particles are mainly scattered over the surface like the catalysts with the H-Y zeolite hence the lower reduction temperature. The total hydrogen consumption of Ni supported on H-Y zeolite is higher compare to Ni supported on Al2O3 which also proved the lower binding energy between the metals and H-Y zeolite support [27]. Particles that were inserted into the pores of supports have a higher reduction temperature because of high metal-support interaction between the metals like Ni and Mo with the supports Al2O3/H-Y zeolite [54]. Therefore, it can be observed as the percentage of metals loading increased the higher the reduction temperature of all the catalysts because of the stronger interaction between the metals and supports. To investigate the acidity of the Al2O3 and H-Y zeolite supported catalysts, Temperature programmed Desorption (TPD) was done with ammonia in the temperature range of 50–800 °C and the results were depicted in Fig. 9. Ammonia (NH3) because of its basic characteristic was absorbed into the catalysts’ acid sites. After that, the NH3 will be removed through the desorption process at high temperature. The strength of the interaction between the NH3 and the surface acid sites of the catalysts directly affected the desorption temperature of ammonia. The higher the interaction the higher the temperature needed for the desorption process. Moreover, the amount of ammonia desorbed can be quantified by the NH3 desorption peaks [55–58]. The acidic strength of the catalysts can be classified as weak, moderate and strong based on the NH3 desorption peak’s temperature. The peaks at 120–300 °C are weak acid sites, 200–500 °C medium and 500–700 °C are considered strong [59–61]. The weak and medium acid sites were usually considered Lewis acid sites where desorption of weakly bonded ammonia occur. While the higher temperature peaks represent the desorption of strongly bonded ammonia on Bronsted acid sites. Additionally, the surface area under the peak shows the relative number of acid sites available on the catalysts. The higher the area the higher the number of acid sites [56]. Based on Fig. 9, it can be concluded from the TPD peaks that Al2O3 had weak and medium acid sites while H-Y zeolite supported catalyst had weak, medium and strong acid sites. The distribution of the acidic sites for both catalysts was following previous studies [44,56,60,62–64]. Moreover, the amount of acid sites of the 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite is significantly higher than 10%Ni/Al2O3 which can be proven from the total surface area under the peaks and the quantitative value in Table 1. These results proved that H-Y zeolite supported catalysts had more and stronger acidic sites compare to alumina supported catalysts. It is believed that by adding Mo into the catalysts in this study, the acid sites also decreased as shown in Table 6 as it was reported that adding the second metal into the catalysts will decrease the number of acid sites on the catalysts [59,61]. This circumstance inadvertently reduce carbon deposited on the catalysts as the amount of Mo doping increased because the lower the acidity of the catalysts the lower the coking rate will be on the catalysts [59,61,65,66]. 3.1.5 Thermal behaviour study of the catalyst The TGA analysis was performed to investigate and determine the calcination temperature of the samples, their weight loss, structural destruction as well as thermal behaviour of each catalyst under the controlled atmosphere as a function of temperature and time. The graphs plotted show the reduced weight of the catalysts and the derivative weight (DTG) for 10%Ni/Al2O3, 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 5%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite, 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite catalysts. The graphs in Fig. 7 show the TGA and DTG of 10%Ni/Al2O3, 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3 and 5%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3. The TGA shows the weight loss of catalysts until they reach a constant temperature of 491 °C for 10%Ni/Al2O3, 504 °C for 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3 and 537 °C for 5%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3. As for 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite, 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite catalyst, the temperature became constant at the temperature of 323, 348 and 382 °C respectively as shown in Fig. 8. These graph trends indicate that it already stabilizes at that point of temperature where there is no more weight loss for the catalysts. Conclusively, the most suitable temperature to calcine the catalysts with support Al2O3 is 550 °C and 400 °C for catalysts with the H-Y zeolite support, observed from the TGA results. The lower temperature for H-Y zeolite catalysts to lose weight is because the higher surface area of the catalysts eases the evaporation of foreign substance from the catalysts. The figures also denote the derivative weight (DTG) which indicates the weight loss over time against the temperature of the catalysts. By referring to the figures, two main peaks can be recognized from the plot. The first peak which is located between 27 °C and 150 °C indicates that there was the removal of bulk water and physiosorbed water. Meanwhile, the second peak which detected between 200 °C and 300 °C shows that the removal of nitrates and ammonium salts in the catalysts to form nickel oxides and molybdenum oxide [67]. All catalysts exhibited similar behaviour in terms of the removal of humidity and foreign substances."
9,Catalyst performance,"3.2 Catalyst performance In reactions routes of aqueous phase reforming APR of sorbitol and glycerol, they each consist of two similar steps; first hydrogen and CO are being formed from the reforming of sorbitol/glycerol. Subsequently, the CO produced is converted into CO2 and hydrogen. Naturally, these two reactions are catalysed by supported metal catalyst at a certain temperature (210–250 °C) and elevated pressure (20–50 bars). The pathway of the APR sorbitol process is considered to be similar to glucose. But, the advantage of sorbitol feedstock over glucose is because of the reduced homogeneous side reactions of sorbitol [68]. In the recent study of APR Alvear et al. [16] found that APR of sorbitol and glycerol offered a potential source for the production of liquid products by using the bimetallic catalysts of Pt-Pd. Particularly sorbitol which produced more variety of liquid products compared to the other alcohols and produced potential chemicals such as methanol and propanediol. In this study, both feeds gave a low conversion rate was mainly because the reaction was done in a batch reactor which can increase the competitiveness of the feed and products to be adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. Other possible reasons for the low conversion are the pressure of the reaction were not enough to cleave the C-C bonds in the feeds and also the low amount of feeds concentration that been fed into the reactor for the reaction. However, the production of value-added chemicals was still produced from the APR and a detailed explanation will be discussed in this study. 3.2.1 Aqueous phase reforming of sorbitol Table 2 shows the possible products that were produced from APR are ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, glycerol and 1,3-propanediol over 10%Ni/Al2O3, 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3 , 5%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite, 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite catalysts. The production of pentanediol and butanediol was achieved through decarbonylation reactions where derivatives containing less C4-C5 carbon atoms being converted from sorbitol. As for the ethylene glycol production, it was achieved through the cleavage of C-C bonds of sorbitol to form polyols with C3-C4 carbon atoms such as glycerol that also can be further transformed into linear ketones, diol or alcohol such as propanediol and methanol through hydrogenation and dehydration process as reported [41,69]. The hydrogenation process which occurs in the reaction was believed to happen because of the hydrogen produced by the water gas shift (WGS) reaction in the APR and it was confirmed by GC-TCD that there is hydrogen production through the APR in this study. Higher selectivity and yield of 1,3-propanediol and glycerol especially from 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 5%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite catalysts were probably because of the presence of the higher amount of acid sites on the catalysts which can promote the dehydration and hydrogenation on Ni surface [70]. This can be proven by the TPD result where H-Y zeolite supported catalysts had more acid sites compare to alumina supported catalysts. Even though alumina supported catalysts had fewer and weaker acidic sites, they still helped in promoting the reforming of sorbitol especially by dehydration and hydrogenation process but less effective compare to H-Y zeolite supported catalysts. Both alumina and H-Y zeolite supported catalysts behave the same ways in producing the value-added chemicals because the supports are acidic type. Fig. 9 illustrates the possible paths that may be observed during the APR of sorbitol. It can be acknowledged that Ni supported on H-Y zeolite catalysts performed better than Ni supported on Al2O3 in terms of the conversion of sorbitol to the liquid value-added chemicals. This result agreed with the characterization data where Ni supported H-Y zeolite have better results which they have more surface area and better dispersion that can provide more active sites for reaction. 3.2.2 Aqueous phase reforming of glycerol There are mainly two main possible parallel routes that have been discussed in this study for the formation of intermediate liquids; glycerol dehydration to 1-hydroxyacetone and 3-hydroxypropanal from the glycerol dehydration. Formation of products through 1-hydroxyacetone can go through extra hydrogenation to produce propane-1,2-diol which can later be converted into acetone through the dehydration process. Propane-1,2- diol subsequently was dehydrated to produce propionaldehyde and/or propane-2-one which can be further converted to propane-1-ol or propane-2-ol through hydrogenation. Light alkanes for instance propane and butane can also be formed from these two chemicals. Ethanol could also be developed from the hydrogenation of propane-2-ol [8]. Propane and butane unfortunately were not produced from the APR of glycerol in this study. For the second route, the 3-hydroxypropanal was not found in the liquid product in nearly all studies related to the aqueous phase reforming of glycerol. From this, it can be suggested that the formation of 1-hydroxypropan-2-one through dehydration is more possible to occur or that instantaneous conversion of 3-hydroxypropanal into other products may occur in other consequent reactions. These reactions produce propane-1,3-diol by hydrogenation reaction or 3- hydroxy propionic acid, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde from the retro-aldol reaction. By using the propane-1,3-diol, propionaldehyde can also be produced through the dehydration process [71]. Unfortunately, propane-1,3-diol selectivity (<0.001%) in this study was too small in which can be neglected. Some of the highest potential value-added chemicals that were produced from the aqueous phase reforming of glycerol are acetone, 1,4-dioxane-2,6-dimethanol and ethylene glycol. Acetone was detected in four liquid products, 1,4-dioxane-2,6-dimethanol was detected in all six liquid products while ethylene glycol was detected in three of the liquid products catalysed by H-Y zeolite support. Table 3 shows the selectivity of the different chemicals in the liquid products that were produced. Based on Table 3, acetone was the chemical with the highest selectivity in the liquid products where it was detected with 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3 having the highest selectivity of 6.58%. The selectivity of ethylene glycol, propanoic acid and acetic acid were relatively low in the liquid products of the APR of glycerol. The production of the highest selective chemical i.e. acetone is mainly due to glycerol underwent dehydration and mainly converted into ketones and carboxylic acids [72]. This is because the acidic sites of the catalysts play a major role in promoting the dehydration process in the APR for acetone formation. Acetone also can be selectively produced through ketonization from two molecules of acetic acid as reported [73]. Both types of supports had been proven to be selective towards acetone and promoted the dehydration of glycerol during the APR of glycerol. The possible reaction pathways that were concluded from the products produced from the aqueous phase reforming of glycerol were depicted in Fig. 10. As for the APR of glycerol, it can be concluded that Ni supported on H-Y catalysts are also better in terms of catalytic performance and feed conversion because of the higher surface area which delivered more reaction sites.( Figs. 11–13). 3.2.3 A comparison study with wet impregnation synthesize catalyst A comparative study had been performed to prove the effectiveness of sonosynthesized catalysts compared to wetness impregnated catalysts. The difference between the wetness impregnation synthesis method and sonochemical method occurs during the stirring process which we introduced ultrasound in the stirring step. The structural properties and reaction conversion of sorbitol/glycerol to liquid products were chosen and discussed in this comparative study. It can be seen from the structural properties results in Table 4 that sonochemical synthesized catalysts gave better structural properties especially in term of surface area. Moreover, from Table 5, it can be seen that the conversion of feed for both sorbitol and glycerol were higher by using sonochemically synthesized catalysts compare to wet impregnated catalysts. These are mainly because the effectiveness of this sonochemical method lies within its cavitation phenomenon where the application of the sonic waves is bound to create bubbles at the nanoscale, which burst rapidly. During the collapse of the bubbles, the solid particles become smaller and this phenomenon occurs in less than a second. This phenomenon creates a massive temperature that is generated at the specified hot spots (5000–25,000 K) and pressure of 180 MPa. The high temperature and pressure promote the break of chemical bonds and ease the process of impregnation during the synthesis process. Agglomeration of particles is also prevented by an abrupt decrement in temperature [26,34,39]. As reported by some researchers, the catalysts that were synthesized sonochemically gave better characteristic, better catalytic performances and also have anti-coking performance [26,27]. Additionally, the advantage of ultrasound in the preparation is to shorten the time taken for the stirring process and also improve the dispersion of the particles in the catalysts. The sonochemical approach has offered the dispersion of particles which lead to favourable catalytic performance as well as the improvement of the specific surface area. Moreover, the sonosynthesized catalysts also gave a better performance in term of feed conversion to liquid products in the APR of sorbitol and glycerol. As reported by [27,28,32], the catalysts that were synthesized sonochemically gave better characteristic, better catalytic performances and also have anti-coking performance. The bigger surface area of the sonosynthesized catalysts gave more active sites for the reaction to occur. Hence, it can be concluded that by introducing the ultrasound in the synthesis method, the structural properties and also the performance of the catalysts can be improved. 3.2.4 Recycling of the catalysts To investigate the recyclability of the catalysts, a batch of 10%Ni/Al2O3, 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3, 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite catalysts were utilized repeatedly in APR of sorbitol and the results of the performance were depicted in Table 6. Carbon formation on the catalysts which was obtained from EDX analysis was also shown in the same table. A significant decrease in the conversion rate of the feed can be observed from the APR of sorbitol for the catalysts without the doping of Mo. 10% Ni/Al2O3 and10%Ni/H-Y zeolite catalysts gave both less than 50% of the initial conversion after the 3rd run, 16.3–7.4% for 10% Ni/Al2O3 and 28.4–12.4% for 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite. While, the catalyst with the Mo doping gave excellent results, where the decrease of conversion did not exceed 30% of the initial conversion of sorbitol. 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3 only decreased from 18.4% to 13.7% and 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite conversion decreased from 28.5% to 23.8% after three times running for APR of sorbitol. The significant decreased in conversion for the catalysts without the doping of Mo is because of the higher carbon formation on the catalyst during the APR reaction as proven by the significant decrease in the average surface area of the catalysts in Table 1. The catalysts with the addition of Mo were proven to decreased the carbon deposited on the catalysts and improved the performance of the catalysts during the reaction as also proven by [20,27,38,62,74]."
10,Conclusion,"Six catalysts were synthesized using different ratios of nickel (10%) and molybdenum (0%, 1% and 5%) on alumina support and H-Y zeolite support by using the sonochemical method. The sonochemical catalyst synthesis method gives excellent comparable results in comparison to other conventional approaches for catalysts synthesis. Based on the results of all the characterization, it can be proved that catalysts with the H-Y zeolite as a support are better in the physical characteristics in the term of the surface area, crystallinity, acidity density and thermal stability in comparison to catalyst with the alumina support on nickel. Sonosynthesized catalysts had also proven to be better in term of performance and structural properties compared to the wetness impregnated catalysts. From the catalytic performances, it can also be concluded that H-Y zeolite supports proved with good physicochemical, morphological characteristic leads to highly selective value-added chemicals production and also greater conversion to liquid products performance. Methanol (0.48%), ethylene glycol (8.3%), 1,4-butanediol (3.9%), glycerol (22.5%) and 1,3-propanediol (24.3%) had been identified as highly selective value-added chemicals from the HPLC result from the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of sorbitol. The catalysts especially 10%Ni/H-Y zeolite and 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite favor the decarbonylation reaction to produce pentanediol and butanediol and they favor the cleavage of C-C bond reactions which produced products like ketones and alcohols in the APR of sorbitol. 1%Mo-10%Ni/H-Y zeolite can be chosen as the best support for APR of sorbitol in this study as it highly selective towards 1,3-propanediol. Whereas, in APR of glycerol some of the most selective value-added chemicals that were produced are acetone (6.58%), 1,4-dioxane-2,6-dimethanol (1.571%) and ethylene glycol (0.39%). 1%Mo-10%Ni/Al2O3 can be chosen as the best catalyst for APR of glycerol since it has the highest selectivity towards acetone in this work. Production of acetone and 1,4-Dioxane-2,6-dimethanol can also be further investigated using catalysts with H-Y zeolite support since they showed a high tendency to produce those chemicals. It was proven that H-Y zeolite support gave better selectivity towards liquid products as it is better in terms of physicochemical properties compared to the Al2O3 support. Moreover, the addition of Mo to the catalysts had improved the performance and also strength of the catalysts during the APR reaction. Hence, it can be stated that the APR of biomass-derived oxygenates can also be applied to produce value-added chemicals besides hydrogen production. However, it is important to select the best catalyst and also the optimum condition to facilitate the value-added liquid production. The conversion and catalytic activity also need to be enhanced in future study. Further investigation and optimization of parameters (temperature, pressure, feed concentration) are prerequisites for further investigation to improve the conversion rate of the feed and also the yield of the intermediate products choosing more active metals i.e., Ca, Mg or Pt and acidic support such as ZrO2, CeO2 and La2O3."
