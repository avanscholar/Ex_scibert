0,Introduction,"A hydrogen economy, in which H2 will replace fossil fuels for electricity generation, chemical synthesis and transportation, is a compelling vision whose realization demands major technological advances in H2 production, distribution and storage [1–4]. Water splitting and alcohol photo-reforming using semiconductor photocatalysts and sunlight are promising future technologies for H2 production. A wide range of semiconductor materials have been investigated in relation to solar H2 production from water or biofuels, including oxides, sulphides, nitrides and oxynitrides [5,6]. However, very few materials satisfy all of the fundamental requirements for an effective water splitting photocatalyst. These requirements include: (1) long term stability is against photo-corrosion under reaction conditions; (2) the top of the valence band (VB) of the semiconductor must be more positive than redox potential of the O2/H2O couple (1.23V versus NHE) and the bottom of the conduction band (CB) must be more negative than H2O/H2 couple (0V versus NHE); (3) the electronic band gap (E g) of the semiconductor must be less than 3.4eV to allow solar excitation [7,8]; and (4) charge carrier lifetimes must be sufficient to allow key redox reactions because electron transfer reactions occur on microsecond timescales [9]. Considering requirements 1–4 above, TiO2 (E g =3.0–3.3eV depending on the polymorph) is the most practical semiconductor photocatalyst to use for future solar H2 generation. Upon excitation by photons with E > E g, electrons are promoted from the TiO2 VB into the CB, producing electron–hole pairs (e−–h+). The electrons and holes may recombine (by radiative or non-radiative processes), or migrate to the surface to participate in photoreactions. Photo-excited holes are powerful oxidants, capable of oxidizing water and organics such as alcohols (Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively) whilst photo-excited electrons reduce protons and water to molecular H2 (Eqs. (3) and (4)) [10,11]: (1) H 2 O ( l ) + 2 h + ( VB ) → 1 / 2 O 2 ( g ) + 2 H ( aq ) + (2) RCH 2 OH ( ads ) + 2 h + ( VB ) → RCHO ( l ) + 2 H ( aq ) + (3) 2 H + + 2 e - ( CB ) → H 2 ( g ) (4) 2 H 2 O ( l ) + 2 e - ( CB ) → H 2 ( g ) + 2 OH ( aq ) - Aldehydes formed in step 2 may be further photo-oxidized to CO and then CO2, yielding additional protons for H2 production. Fast e−–h+ recombination following photo-excitation limits the efficiency of most semiconductor photocatalysts, including TiO2, for direct water splitting. Modifying TiO2 with electron accepting co-catalysts, such as Pd, Ag, Pt or Au [8,12–17], is effective in suppressing electron–hole pair recombination. These high work function metals form a rectifying Schottky barrier with TiO2, and serve as cathodic sites for H2 evolution. The co-catalyst, co-catalyst loading, co-catalyst dispersion over the TiO2 support and the physical and electronic properties of the support itself (e.g. anatase, rutile, brookite or combinations thereof) all influence M/TiO2 photocatalyst activity for H2 production rates in water and alcohol–water systems. Fundamental understanding of these factors, and their individual impact on photocatalytic hydrogen production, still requires considerable work. Sacrificial hole scavengers, such as alcohols, further enhance charge-separation [18–23]. Alcohol-photoreforming is energetically facile compared to water splitting, typically affording hydrogen production rates 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than those achieved in pure water. H2 production rates are strongly dependent on the hole scavenger used (typically primary alcohols, diols or triols) [18–23], though little work has been reported examining the effect of alcohol concentration on H2 production rates. A further gap in the scientific literature relating to H2 production over M/TiO2 photocatalysts (M=noble or transition metal) is the scarcity of studies directly comparing the activity of M/TiO2 photocatalysts in different alcohol–water systems. Most studies investigate a single co-catalyst system under a particular set of test conditions (usually in just a single alcohol–water mixture at a fixed alcohol concentration). Due to differences between groups in the manner photocatalytic tests are conducted (e.g. light flux, TiO2 support, photocatalyst loading, reactor design), it is very difficult to gauge the relative merits of different co-catalysts in promoting hydrogen production. The situation is further complicated by the wide range of sacrificial hole scavengers that are used in the literature for photo-catalytic H2 production tests (typically methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol or glycerol at concentrations from 0.1 to 100vol.%). From a fundamental viewpoint, it is of interest to examine the effect of alcohol structure (e.g. primary, secondary or tertiary mono-alcohol; diol or triol) on H2 production rates. Only a limited number of such studies have been reported. Bowker and co-workers [18–22] studied hydrogen production rates over Pd/P25 TiO2 in different alcohol–water mixtures, and concluded that the presence of α-hydrogens on the alcohol was critical to achieving high H2 production rates. H2 production tests using 20 different sacrificial reagents established the reactivity series triols>diols>2° alcohols>1° alcohols>3° alcohols [18]. A reactivity trend 1° alcohols>2° alcohols>3° alcohols was found for Au/P25 TiO2 on a more limited range of mono-alcohols [19]. Yang et al. saw a similar trend and reported a correlation between H2 production and alcohol polarity in a more limited study using 1° and 2° alcohols over Pt/TiO2 [23]. In order to accurately rank Pd, Pt and Au co-catalysts in terms of their ability to promote H2 production on TiO2, beyond generalizations, a detailed comparative investigation is needed that also considers the nature of the alcohols used as the sacrificial agents. No such study has yet been reported, motivating the current work. Here, we compare the activities of M/TiO2 (M=Pd, Pt, Au) photocatalysts for H2 production in various alcohol–water mixtures (10vol.% alcohol, 90vol.% H2O) under UV excitation. M/TiO2 photo-catalysts were prepared at near optimal co-catalyst loadings of 1wt.%. A further 0.5wt.% Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst was also prepared so that the activities of the Pd, Pt and Au co-catalysts to be compared at a similar molar co-catalyst loading. To allow easy comparison with the prior work of other groups, Degussa P25 TiO2 (85wt.% anatase, 15wt.% rutile) was used as the support phase. Alcohols used as sacrificial reagents were methanol and ethanol (both primary alcohols), 2-propanol (a secondary alcohol), tertiary butanol (a tertiary alcohol), 1,2-ethanediol and 1,2-propanediol (both diols) and glycerol (a triol). This selection of alcohols enabled the effects of alcohol structure (especially C:O ratio and number of α-H atoms) and alcohol properties (including polarity, polarizability and oxidation potential) on photo-catalytic H2 production rates to be examined."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Palladium chloride (⩾99%), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (98%), tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate (⩾99%), urea (⩾99.5%), hydrochloric acid (37wt.%), alcohols (⩾99.5%) including methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, tertiary butanol, 1,2-ethanediol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol, were all obtained from Sigma–Aldrich and used without further purification. Degussa P25 TiO2 (85wt.% anatase, 15wt.% rutile, ⩾99.5%) was obtained from a local supplier. Milli-Q water (18.2MΩcm resistivity) was used for preparation of all photocatalysts and in the photocatalytic H2 production tests."
3,"Preparation of M/TiO2 photo-catalysts (M=Pd, Pt or Au)","2.2 Preparation of M/TiO2 photo-catalysts (M=Pd, Pt or Au) M/TiO2 (M=Pd, Pt or Au) photocatalysts were prepared by the deposition precipitation with urea method (DPU) following procedures similar to those described by Zanella et al. and Alonso et al. [24,25]. Briefly, HAuCl4·3H2O (1.654g), PdCl2 (0.745g) or H2PtCl6·6H2O (2.175g) was separately dissolved in milli-Q water (1L) to give metal stock solutions of concentration 4.2×10−3 molL−1. To assist with the dissolution of PdCl2, HCl (37wt.%, 1mL) was first added to the PdCl2 in 20mL of water, after which the solution was made up to a final volume of 1L with milli-Q water. For the preparation of the 0.5wt.% Pd/TiO2 and 1wt.% Pd/TiO2 photocatalysts, Pd2+ stock solution (33.7mL and 67.8mL, respectively) was diluted with milli-Q water to a total volume of 300mL. Urea (7.50g) and P25 TiO2 (3g) were then added to the solutions under vigorous mechanical stirring, after which the solutions were heated to 80°C and held at this temperature for 8h. The resulting powders were collected by vacuum filtration, washed repeatedly with milli-Q, and then air dried at 50°C overnight. The same procedure was used for the preparation of the 1wt.% Pt/TiO2 and 1wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, with the 4.2×10−3 molL−1 Pd2+ stock solution being replaced by the 4.2×10−3 molL−1 Pt4+ or 4.2×10−3 molL−1 Au3+ stock solution (36.8mL diluted to 300mL with milli-Q water), respectively. Following drying, the powders were calcined at 350°C in static air for 2h. This reduced surface Au3+ to Au0. The PdO/TiO2 and PtO/TiO2 powders obtained by calcination in static air at 350°C were subsequently heated to500°Cfor2h in a H2/N2 flow (5vol.% H2, 100mLmin−1) to reduce adsorbed cationic species to their metallic form [25,26]."
4,M/TiO2 photo-catalyst characterization,"2.3 M/TiO2 photo-catalyst characterization TEM images were taken on a TECNAI 12 TEM operating at 200kV. Powders samples were dispersed in ethanol and then several drops of the resulting dispersion placed on holey carbon coated copper TEM grids for analysis. XRF data were taken on a Siemens SRS3000 spectrometer. Data reduction used Siemens SPECTRA 3000 software. Samples were analysed directly as powders supported on Mylar films. Powder XRD patterns were collected on a Philips PW-1130 diffractometer, equipped with a Cu anode X-ray tube and a curved-graphite filter monochromator. Data were taken from 2θ =2–100° (0.02°, 2°min−1) using Cu Kα X-rays (λ =1.5418Å). The rutile:anatase ratio in the samples was determined according to the method described by Fu et al. [27]: (5) % Rutile = 1 [ ( A / R ) × 0.884 + 1 ] × 100 where A is the peak area for the anatase(101) reflection at 2θ =25.3° and R is the peak area for the rutile(110) reflection at 2θ =27.4°. UV–Vis absorbance spectra were collected over the wavelength range 220–1200nm on a Shimadzu UV-2600PC scanning spectrophotometer fitted with a Shimadzu ISR-260 integrating sphere attachment. BaSO4 powder was used as a reference. XPS data were taken on the soft X-ray beamline of the Australian Synchrotron, equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyser and an analysis chamber of base pressure ∼1×10−10 Torr. Spectra were excited at a photon energy of 1486.7eV (Al Kα equivalent), and calibrated against the C 1s signal of adventitious hydrocarbons at 285.0eV. M/TiO2 powders were gently pressed into thin pellets of ∼0.1mm thickness for the analyses. Survey scans were collected at a pass energy of 40eV over the binding energy range 1200–0eV, whilst core level scans were collected with a pass energy of 10eV. Pd K-edge and Au LIII-edge EXAFS data were collected on the BL01B1 beamline of the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (SPring-8). The storage ring was operated at 8GeV and a ring current of 44–65mA. A Si(311) single crystal was used to monochromatize the X-ray beam, and two ion chambers filled with Ar and Kr were used as detectors of I 0 and I, respectively. The photon flux was 109–1011/s. Samples analysed included PdO/TiO2 and Au(OH)3/TiO2 (i.e. M/TiO2 photocatalyst precursors before final H2 reduction and calcination treatments, respectively); Pd/TiO2 obtained by reduction of PdO/TiO2 at 500°C in a H2/N2 flow; Au/TiO2 obtained by calcination of Au(OH)3/TiO2 at 350°C; and associated reference materials. Powders were pressed into thin pellets for the EXAFS measurements, with a specific pellet thickness and density chosen to give an edge jump of ∼0.4. All data reported here were collected in transmission mode at room temperature. For EXAFS analysis, the oscillation was extracted from the EXAFS data by a spline smoothing method, and then normalized by the edge height around 50eV above the absorption threshold. R-space plots were obtained by performing a Fourier transformation of the k3 -weighted EXAFS oscillation from k-space to r-space over the range 30–155nm−1. N2 physisorption isotherms were determined at liquid nitrogen temperature (−195°C) using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 instrument. Specific surfaces areas were calculated from the N2 adsorption data according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using P/P o values in the range 0.05–0.2. Cumulative pore volumes and average pore diameters were calculated from the adsorption isotherms by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Samples were degassed at 100°C under vacuum for 1h prior to the N2 physisorption measurements. Photoluminescence data were collected on a Perkin–Elmer LS-55 Luminescence Spectrometer. Spectra were excited at 310nm, and photoluminescence spectra recorded over the range of 330–600nm using a standard photomultiplier. A 290nm cutoff filter was used."
5,H2 production tests on the M/TiO2 photocatalysts,"2.4 H2 production tests on the M/TiO2 photocatalysts Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests on the M/TiO2 photocatalysts were carried out in a tubular Pyrex reactor (105mL volume) containing water or alcohol–water mixtures (10vol.% aqueous solutions of methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, tertbutanol, 1,2-ethanediol, 1,2-propanediol or glycerol). Photocatalyst (0.0065g) was placed in the reactor and flushed under a nitrogen flow for 20min to remove oxygen. Water (20mL) or alcohol–water mixture (20mL) was then injected into the reactor through a rubber septum. The resulting suspension was then sonicated for 5min to ensure good photocatalyst dispersion and then stirred continuously in the dark for 30min. The reactor was then exposed to UV light, supplied from a Spectraline model SB-1000P/F lamp (200W, 365nm) at a distance of 8cm from the reactor. The photon flux at the sample was approximately 5.1mWcm−2 (the UV flux from the Sun is approximately 5mWcm−2). Hydrogen evolution was monitored by taking gas headspace samples (1mL) at 20min intervals and injecting these into a Shimadzu GC 2014 equipped with a TCD detector and Carboxen-1010 plot capillary column (L ×I.D. 30m×0.53mm, average thickness 30μm). H2 produced during photoreaction was quantified against an external calibration curve. Photocatalytic data presented here are the mean±standard deviation of 3 replicate runs."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"M/TiO2 (M=Pd, Pt or Au) photocatalyst characterization","3.1 M/TiO2 (M=Pd, Pt or Au) photocatalyst characterization Fig. 1 shows TEM images for the different M/TiO2 photocatalysts. The Pd/TiO2 (Fig. 1(a) and 1(b)) and Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts (Fig. 1(c) and 1(e)) both had very high metal nanoparticle dispersions, with mean metal nanoparticle sizes of ∼2 and 1.3nm, respectively. For the Pd/TiO2 photocatalysts, accurate determination of the mean Pd nanoparticle size was not possible due to the low metal loadings and the modest image contrast between nanocrystalline Pd and the larger TiO2 particles. The 1wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst had a mean Au nanoparticle size of 5.4nm (Fig. 1(d) and (f)). The larger size of the Au nanoparticles, compared to the Pd and Pt nanoparticles, can be attributed to a weaker metal support interaction in the case of Au with TiO2. Regarding the P25 TiO2 support, the small 20–30nm particles seen in the images can generally be classified as anatase and the large angular particles (40–70nm) classified as rutile, as has been reported previously in other works [28,29] and supported by the XRD data of Fig. S1. XRD patterns for all catalysts were dominated by peaks due to the P25 TiO2 support (Fig. S1). The weight fraction of anatase and rutile in the M/TiO2 powders, determined from the peak areas of the anatase(101) and rutile(110) reflections, was approximately 6:1 for all samples. Average anatase and rutile particle sizes estimated from FWHM of the anatase(101) and rutile(110) reflections using the Scherrer equation, were approximately 27 and 55nm, respectively for all photocatalysts. This confirms that metal deposition and subsequent calcination or H2 reduction treatments did not modify the phase composition of the P25 TiO2 support. No diffraction peaks were seen for Pd or Pt in the diffraction patterns of the Pd/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts, respectively (Fig. S1(a)–(c)). This was not surprising given the small Pd and Pt nanoparticle sizes and the low nominal metal loadings. Line broadening caused by quantum size effects is expected to be significant for metal nanoparticles of size 1–2nm. In the case of the 1wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, some additional weak and broad peaks were observed which could be assigned to fcc Au. The most obvious of these was the Au(200) reflection at 44.5° (Fig. S1(d)). The Au(111) reflection at 38.2°, which is expected to be the most intense reflection for a statistically randomly distributed fcc Au powder, is obscured here by the anatase (103), (004) and (112) reflections. UV–Vis absorbance spectra for the M/TiO2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2 (a). All photocatalysts showed strong absorption below 400nm due to band gap excitation in the P25 TiO2 support. The Pd/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts showed intense absorption at visible and NIR wavelengths, which increased slightly towards shorter wavelengths. This is characteristic for supported Pd and Pt nanoparticles, and consistent with the grey colour of these samples. Pd and Pt nanoparticles do not show discrete surface plasmon absorptions in the visible spectrum because of a damping effect caused by d–d interband transitions (i.e. the plasmon energy is lost by excitation of single electron interband transitions [30,31]). In contrast, the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst displayed a broad absorption feature centred at 570nm, which can readily be assigned to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of supported Au nanoparticles. This LSPR feature is responsible for the distinctive purple colour of the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst [29,32,33]. Tauc plots for the M/TiO2 photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 2(b) and the calculated band gaps are listed in Table 1 . The band gaps determined for all catalysts were similar to those determined for P25 TiO2, indicating that metal deposition and subsequent calcination of H2 reduction treaments did not alter the TiO2 support. Metal loadings determined by XRF for each M/TiO2 photocatalyst were in very good accord with the nominal loadings (Table 1), and for the purposes of the discussion below can be considered identical. XPS and EXAFS analyses were conducted on the M/TiO2 photocatalysts to verify that the metal co-catalysts were in the expected Pd0, Pt0 and Au0 states. Pd K-edge EXAFS spectra and corresponding r-space plots for the 1wt.% Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst and its PdO/TiO2 precursor, are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b) respectively. The data for the Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst were qualitatively similar to those collected for a 5μm thick Pd metal reference foil, whereas the data for the Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst precursor (i.e. PdO/TiO2) closely resembled those collected for PdO [34]. Pd 3d XPS analysis on the 1wt.% Pd/TiO2 sample (Fig. 3(c)) was dominated by peaks at 335.4eV and 340.7eV (3:2 area ratio), typical for metallic Pd (Pd5/2 and Pd3/2 transitions, respectively). A further set of Pd 3d features seen at 336.7 and 342.0eV (also in a 3:2 area ratio) can be assigned to a PdII species, likely PdO or Pd(OH)2 [35,36]. Deconvolution of the spectrum through curve-fitting (not shown) revealed the Pd0:PdII ratio to be approximately 3:1. The cationic Pd species likely formed through exposure of the H2-reduced Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst to air (EXAFS and XPS spectra were collected immediately and 3weeks after activation by H2 reduction at 500°C, respectively). The surface Pd:Ti ratios determined by XPS were in reasonable accord with the nominal loadings (Table 1). The Pt 4f XPS spectrum of the 1wt.% Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. 3(d)) showed peaks at 71.3 and 74.7eV in a 4:3 area ratio, characteristic for metallic Pt0 (Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2, respectively). Pt 4f peaks for metallic Pt are inherently asymmetric, but one cannot completely exclude a minor contribution from Pt(OH)2 or PtO (Pt 4f7/2 =74.0eV) or PtO2 (Pt 4f7/2 =74.8eV) species. If cationic Pt(II) or Pt(IV) species were present, their total contribution is small, likely less than 10% of the total Pt 4f signal in Fig. 3(d). The Au 4f XPS spectrum for the 1wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. 3(e)) showed only a single set of Au 4f peaks at 83.6 and 87.3eV, respectively, in a 4:3 peak area ratio. These peaks are readily assigned to the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 peaks, respectively, of supported Au0 nanoparticles on TiO2 [28,29]. It should be noted that the Au 4f peaks for the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst are observed at a slightly lower binding energy than the corresponding peaks for unsupported Au (c.f. Au 4f7/2 =84.0eV), on account of electronic interactions with the support [37]. Au LIII EXAFS measurements confirmed that metallic Au was the only form of Au present on the surface of the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. 3(f) and (g)). The Au LIII EXAFS spectrum of the Au(OH)3/TiO2 sample (Fig. 3(f)) showed an intense feature just above the absorption edge, characteristic for Au3+ species such as Au(OH)3 or Au2O3 [38,39]. This feature, and Au–O related features in Fig. 3(g), disappeared completely following sample calcination at 350°C for 2h, the final step used in the preparation of the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst. Near surface region M:Ti ratios determined by XPS analysis for the M/TiO2 photocatalysts are presented in Table 1, and were in good accord with expectations based on the nominal metal loadings and the surface sensitivity of the XPS technique. Deposition of Pd, Pt and Au was expected to suppress e−–h+ pair recombination in P25 TiO2, due to the migration of photo-excited electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 onto the supported metal nanoparticles. EPR results of other researchers have indicated that Pt is more efficient than Au in facilitating such charge transfer (from Ti3+ to M) [12]. Fig. 4 shows photoluminescence (PL) data for P25 TiO2 and the M/TiO2 photocatalysts, and may be compared with our other recent works investigating photoluminescence behaviour of TiO2 modified with Au, Pt or CuO co-catalysts [28,29,40]. Under 310nm excitation, the un-modified P25 TiO2 support gave an intense photoluminescence signal due to radiative e−–h+ recombination following photoexcitation. The PL peak was centred at 3.13eV, and consists primarily of direct transitions (X1b →X1a, 3.45eV and X1b →X2b, 3.59eV) and phonon-assisted indirect transitions (X1b →Γ3, 3.19eV; Γ1b →X2b 3.05eV; and Γ1b →X1a 2.91eV) of anatase in the P25 TiO2 support [28,41,42]. PL contributions from the rutile component in P25 TiO2 are masked by the PL signal from anatase (P25 TiO2 is ∼85wt.% anatase). Weaker features at energies of 2.80, 2.70, 2.56 and 2.34 are ascribed to oxygen vacancies (VO″) and defects on the TiO2 support. Metal deposition strongly attenuated the photoluminescence signal of P25 TiO2, with the extent of attenuation following the order Pt>Au≈Pd (versus P25 TiO2, the PL intensity decreased by 57%, 60% and 68% for the 1wt.% Pd, Au and Pt photocatalysts, respectively). The data of Fig. 4 confirm that each metal co-catalyst functions effectively as an electron acceptor (“electron sink”), thereby increasing the number of charge carriers (h+ or e−) available for photoreactions on TiO2 surfaces, an aspect we explore in detail below."
8,"H2 production activity of the M/TiO2 (M=Pd, Pt or Au) photocatalysts in different alcohol–water mixtures","3.2 H2 production activity of the M/TiO2 (M=Pd, Pt or Au) photocatalysts in different alcohol–water mixtures Fig. 5 shows plots of H2 production versus UV irradiation time for each M/TiO2 photocatalyst in different alcohol–water mixtures. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, under standardized test conditions (10vol.% alcohol, UV flux 5.1mWcm−2). The M/TiO2 photocatalysts were stable in each of the alcohol–water systems, as evidenced by the linear H2 evolution rates over the 4h reaction period (tests conducted for longer periods (in days) using ethanol, 1,2-ethanediol and glycerol (as examples) still showed linear hydrogen production). The H2 production rates differed depending on the metal co-catalyst (especially Pd compared with Pt or Au) and the alcohol was used as the sacrificial hole scavenger. H2 production rates in milli-Q water were very low for all M/TiO2 photocatalysts, reflecting the greater ability of the alcohols to act as sacrificial hole scavengers. In order to further understand the effect of the metal, we have calculated the rates per unit mass and unit area of the semiconductor as well as the unit mass and unit area of the metal co-catalyst. These photocatalytic H2 production rates, in mmolg−1 h−1, molgM −1 h−1, mmol molM −1 h−1 and molmM −2 h−1 (where M stands for Au, Pd or Pt), extracted from the data of Fig. 5 are presented graphically in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively, and numerically in Tables 2 and S1. To calculate rates normalized against metal surface area (molmM −2 h−1), mean particle sizes determined by TEM were used, with the assumption that supported metal particles were spheres (see Table S2). We will first address the effect of the different metal co-catalysts on photocatalytic H2 production rates. In each alcohol–water system tested, except tertbutanol, the Pd/TiO2 photocatalysts demonstrated superior performance to the Pt/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, with the activity of the Pt/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts being quite similar (Fig. 6(a)). The 0.5wt.% Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst was more active than the 1wt.% Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst when the rate was normalized against the amount of co-catalyst (Figs. 6(b) and 7(a)), whilst the 1wt.% M/TiO2 photocatalysts were all of similar activity when the rate was normalized by the molar co-catalyst loading (Fig. 7(a)). Yet, the activity of the 1wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst was far superior to both the 1wt.% Pd/TiO2 and 1wt.% Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts when normalized against metal surface area (Fig. 7(b)). Results suggest that the considerably larger mean metal nanoparticle size observed in the Au/TiO2 system did not detrimentally impact the photocatalytic H2 production activity (i.e. the 1wt.% Au/TiO2 and 0.5wt.% Pd/TiO2 photocatalysts had approximately the same number of metal atoms, and similar metal area normalized reaction rates). Regarding the general observation that the photocatalytic activity decreased in the order Pd/TiO2 >Pt/TiO2 ≈Au/TiO2, then a key first consideration is the relative work functions of Pd, Pt, Au and TiO2 (5.6, 5.7, 5.3 and 4.2eV, respectively) [43,44]. Theoretically, the larger the difference between the metal work function and that of TiO2, the larger the height of the Schottky barrier formed at the TiO2 surface. Hence, Pt should be more effective than Pd or Au in accepting conduction band electrons in TiO2, and therefore exhibit the highest activity for H2 production. However, the density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level is higher for Pd than for Pt or Au, with the Fermi level of Pd around 0.2eV higher than the Fermi level of Pt (−10.8eV) [45,46]. This could explain why Pd was more active than Pt, even though the former has a slightly lower work function. Pd also has a much lower electron affinity and hence electron trapping capability than Pt and Au [19], which may enable more facile electron transfer from Pd to donor species. It is likely that a combination of the above factors is important to the superior performance of the Pd/TiO2 relative to Pt/TiO2 or Au/TiO2. Another possible consideration is the size and dispersion of the supported metal nanoparticles [23,18,46–50]. However, this does not seem to be important here since the Pt/TiO2 (mean Pt size 1.3nm) and Au/TiO2 (mean Au size 5.4nm) photocatalysts displayed comparable H2 production rates in all alcohol–water mixtures. In Fig. 8 , we have plotted the H2 production rate per metal particle against the H2 production rate per metal atom. To construct the figure we used mean particle sizes from TEM (Fig. 1) and the total number of metal atoms determined by XRF (Table S2). The objective here was to ascertain whether each metal particle behaved as a centre for a catalytic reaction or as a reservoir for excited electrons. The points in the figure represent each of the different alcohols. The first observation is that the rate per particle for Au is about one order of magnitude higher than that of Pd and about 50 times higher than that of Pt. In other words, particle size is not important for the actual H2 evolution process, since high rates are achieved for Au that has the largest metal particle size. This is in sharp contrast to thermal catalytic reactions in general, where reaction rates usually correlate with active metal surface area. If we consider the number of atoms in each particle (i.e. take the rate per particle and divide by the number of atoms in each particle), the H2 production rates were actually quite similar for all catalysts (differing no more than a factor of 2, consistent with the results presented in Table 2). Therefore, one can conclude that within the investigated particle size range (between 1.3 and 5.4nm) hydrogen production rates are largely independent of metal particle size and only weakly dependent on the metal co-catalyst (Pd, Pt or Au). Considering the effect of the different alcohols (sacrificial hole scavengers), it is evident that they did not enhance the reaction rate to the same extent (Figs. 6 and 7). To our knowledge, the H2 production rate reported here for the 1wt.% Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst in 10vol.% glycerol (47.5mmolg−1 h−1) is the highest rates yet reported for photocatalytic H2 production at near solar UV fluxes. Fig. S2 shows H2 production rates (in mmolg−1 h−1) plotted against key physical properties of the alcohols, including number of α-H on the alcohol, alcohol C:O ratio, alcohol polarity, alcohol polarizability, the exponential of the alcohol oxidation potential [exp(E ox°)] and the exponential of the energy change for the alcohol oxidation reaction [exp(−ΔE°)], where Δ E o = E VB ( TiO 2 ) o - E ox o . The justification for plotting against the latter two parameters is discussed below. In all cases, reasonable linear correlations can be drawn which reflects the close association of these different alcohol properties. Fig. 9 (a)–(d) shows the reaction rate per metal atom as a function of alcohol polarity for all different alcohols investigated (data for tert-butanol have been excluded since they do not contain any α-H atoms and therefore its oxidation will follow a different mechanism). For each M/TiO2 photocatalyst, a linear trend is seen, as was observed previously by Yang et al. on a more limited set of alcohols on M/TiO2 [23]. We focus here on the polarity of the alcohol, since it is critical to the interaction of the alcohol with the TiO2 surface. The adsorption of alcohols on TiO2 can be viewed as an acid–base type interaction in which the polarity (dominated by the O 2p states of the alcohol) would play a central role in their interaction with empty Ti 3d states [51]. Moreover, the adsorption energy of primary alcohols has been studied computationally using DFT–GGA [51–54] as well as experimentally using a variety of techniques [55,56]. The adsorption energy difference between the dissociated and molecular forms of methanol and ethanol (as an example) on TiO2 is very close (effectively iso-energetic) with differences in the range of 0.1–0.3eV. Because of this small difference and solvation in the liquid environment the dissociative adsorption of the alcohol (R-OH→RO(a)+OH(a)) is unlikely to be favoured and the main reaction can be viewed as (6) R – CH 2 – OH ( a ) + h + ( VB ) + O ( a ) → RCH – OH + OH ( a ) The alpha hydroxyl radicals formed on TiO2 have been identified previously by ESR under similar reaction conditions to those used here [57]. Considering Eq. (6), it is possible to understand why the polarity of the alcohol is important. High polarity alcohols will interact strongly with the TiO2 surface, resulting in the injection of more electrons into the TiO2 VB. The energy difference between the HOMO of the adsorbed alcohols on top of Ti5c 4+ cations of TiO2(110) rutile surface, based on extracted DOS from DFT–GGA computational methods [51,52], was previously proposed as a useful gauge of alcohol susceptibility to photo-oxidation. Further meaningful information, not entirely unrelated to this, can be garnered by considering the standard oxidation potentials of the individual alcohols. These were calculated from the standard Gibbs free energy change (−ΔG°) for alcohol reforming (Eq. (7)) [50], and presented in Table 3 . (7) C x H y O z + ( 2 x - z ) H 2 O → x CO 2 + n H + + n e - where n = ( 4 x - 2 z + y ) The data show that the oxidation potentials become more positive (versus NHE) in the order glycerol<1,2-ethanediol<methanol<1,2-propanediol<ethanol<2-propanol<tertbutanol≪water. These calculations explain the trends in Figs. 6 and 7 almost perfectly, with glycerol and 1,2-ethanediol affording the highest H2 production rates since they are the best hole scavengers (lowest oxidation potentials versus NHE). The oxidation potentials calculated for the different alcohols (Table 3) are shown in Fig. 10 with respect to the CB and VB of TiO2. It is clear that the larger the potential separation between the alcohol oxidation potential and the TiO2 VB, the higher the H2 production rate. Marcus theory first explored the relationship between the rate constant and Gibbs free energy change of electron transfer reactions [58–62]. Balzani and Scandola [63] proposed the following expression for a simple electron transfer reaction between a donor and an acceptor (8) k e k - e = exp - Δ G / RT where k e and k − e are the rate constants for the forward and reverse electron transfer reactions, respectively, and ΔG is the free-energy change of the electron-transfer step. If we assume that the electron transfer step is rate limiting in the overall donor–acceptor reaction, then we can replace ΔG with the free energy change of reaction (ΔG exp), and obtain the following relationship for the experimental rate constant (k exp) of the electron-transfer reaction. (9) k exp ∝ k e k - e ∝ exp - ( Δ G exp / RT ) ΔG exp can readily be calculated from the standard redox potentials of the donor and the acceptor. Considering the case where water or an alcohol is the electron donor and the valence band of TiO2 is the electron acceptor, we can make the substitution Δ G exp = E VBTiO 2 o - E ox o to obtain (10) k exp ∝ exp - E VB ( TiO 2 ) o - E ox o RT If electron transfer from water or alcohols to TiO2 was the overall rate limiting step in photocatalytic H2 production over M/TiO2 surfaces, then H2 production rates could be expected to correlate with exp E ox o and exp - E VB ( TiO 2 ) o - E ox o . Plots of the H2 production rate (expressed in molecules of H2 Matom −1 s−1) versus exp E ox o are shown in Fig. 11 (a), (c) and (e) for the different M/TiO2 photocatalysts, and reveal a linear relationship, in good agreement with theory [63]. Fig. 11(b), (d) and (f) shows corresponding plots of hydrogen production against exp - E VB ( TiO 2 ) o - E ox o . Again, reasonable linear relationships are seen. These relationships are expected to hold for any n-type semiconductor photocatalyst. It would thus appear that H2 production rates over M/TiO2 photocatalysts in alcohol–water systems may be limited by the kinetics of simple electron transfer reactions between electron donors and valence band holes. It is worth noting that methanol did not follow closely the same trends seen with the other alcohols, typically demonstrating a hydrogen production rate that was lower than expected based on its structure and physical properties. C1 chemistry often differs considerably to similar reactions involving C1 oxygenates, and that also seems to be the case here. One possible reason for the lower than expected H2 production rates seen with methanol might be competing surface reactions. Methanol oxidation can be viewed as follows: (11) CH 3 OH + h + + O ( s ) → H 2 C OH + O H ( a ) (12) H 2 C OH + h + + 2 e - + O H ( a ) → H 2 + HCHO + O ( s ) (13) HCHO + 2 h + + 2 e - → H 2 + CO ( a ) (14) CO ( a ) + H 2 O → H 2 + CO 2 CO(a) is formed as an intermediate in methanol oxidation on M/TiO2 surfaces [19,64]. Because of its high adsorption energy, CO may exist at moderate surface coverages on the surface of the M/TiO2 photocatalysts, with reaction of CO (Eq. (14)) possibly being a rate-limiting-step in the overall H2 production kinetics in methanol–water mixtures. An analogy can be made here with electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol over Pt/C, where the rate limiting step is the surface oxidation of CO(a) to CO2 [65,66]. CO(a) formation could also be expected for photoreactions involving C1 alcohols, but for such alcohols the co-formation of other intermediates may prevent CO accumulation at coverages which could impact H2 production. Another possible reason for the deviation observed with methanol is the ease by which it can be oxidized to formates via formaldehyde as compared to the oxidation of higher alcohols to carboxylates [67,68]. This oxidation can be triggered by either surface oxygen or radical oxygen formed during water oxidation. In the case of methanol, formates may block the surface, with the rate then limited by their decomposition kinetics. For the higher alcohols, the situation is more complex owing to the presence of C–C bonds, and alternative decomposition pathways may lead to other intermediates with faster decomposition/desorption rates (the photo-Kolbe process in the case of acetic acid to ethane and CO2 for example). Detailed reaction mechanism and reaction rate studies are required which shed light on the contribution of the alcohols and alcohol photo-oxidation products to the overall reaction kinetics. Such studies are presently being undertaken by our group. A final consideration is the C:O ratio in the alcohol. Methanol, 1,2-ethanediol and glycerol all have a C:O ratio of 1:1. If the data presented in Fig. 11 for just these 3 alcohols are examined, then H2 production rates correlate well with exp E ox o and exp - E VB ( TiO 2 ) o - E ox o for each different M/TiO2 photocatalyst. Hence, correct interpretation of the data patterns in Fig. 11 may also demand that the C:O ratio of the alcohols and alcohol molar concentration be considered (at a 10vol.% concentration, the molar concentrations of methanol, 1,2-ethanediol and glycerol are 2.47, 1.79 and 1.37molL−1, respectively)."
9,Conclusions,"The activity of M/TiO2 (M=Pd, Pt, Au) photocatalysts for H2 production under UV excitation in alcohol–water mixtures decreases in the order Pd/TiO2 >Pt/TiO2 ≈Au/TiO2 ≫TiO2. Metal co-catalyst particle size was not important for achieving high hydrogen production rates in the M/TiO2 systems, at least within the size range 1–6nm investigated here. For each M/TiO2 photocatalyst, H2 production rates decreased in the order glycerol>1,2-ethanediol>1,2-propanediol>methanol>ethanol>2-propanol>tert-butanol≫water. Reasonable linear correlations were established between the rates of H2 production and alcohol polarity for all M/TiO2 photocatalysts. H2 production rates also tracked well against the exponential of the free energy change of the alcohol oxidation reaction. Methanol however deviated somewhat from the general trends observed with the other alcohols, possibly due to the strong adsorption of methanol-derived reaction intermediates such as CO or formates. Results guide the performance optimization of M/TiO2 photocatalyst systems for solar H2 production."
