0,Introduction,"Production of electricity from wastewater is the most valuable application of microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology. One could say that the power production that occurs in MFCs is a “side-effect” of organic matter decomposition in wastewater, which is the result of microorganisms’ metabolic processes [1,2]. It was estimated that the amount of energy contained in wastewater is over 9 times greater than the amount of energy required for wastewater treatment (283 kW). Therefore, it is possible for MFCs to serve as an energetically self-sufficient treatment technology [3]. However, the efficiency of energy extraction from wastewater is strongly dependent on the microorganisms used. To be suitable for this process, microorganisms must have the ability to effectively decompose organic matter, as this ability is directly associated with the size of the electrical current produced. Unfortunately, it is not possible to use the most efficient electrogens, such as Geobacter or Shewanella sp., for wastewater treatment unassisted, as they are not able to produce electricity directly from complex substrates such as wastewater. It is commonly understood that electrogenic bacteria only use simple substances, mainly volatile fatty acids and simple alcohols, for metabolism [4]. On the other hand, hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria that are able to decompose complex organic compounds are unable to produce electrical currents. Production of electricity from wastewater requires the cooperation of various species, indicating diverse metabolism and coexisting in a consortium, including: (1) hydrolytic and fermenting microorganisms that convert complex organic compounds into simpler substances, and (2) electrogens that are able to convert these simple substances into electrical currents. Selection and optimization of an appropriate consortium for a specific substrate should be our priority if we wish to maximize energy recovery from wastewater. The starting point from which we can move in this direction is the identification of microorganisms that form consortia in MFCs during the wastewater treatment process; this step would then allow us to investigate the operational factors that affect consortium development and the amount of power produced in the system. So far, various types of wastewater (e.g., municipal, agricultural, industrial, and mining) have been used as substrates for electricity production in MFC systems [5]. Studies have increasingly reported on the identification and optimization of microorganisms responsible for wastewater treatment and electrical current production. One such investigation by Ketep et al. identified the syntrophic bacterial consortium that is responsible for the production of electricity from pulp mill wastewater [6]. This anodic community was dominated by Geobacter metallireducens, Pelobacter propionicus, and Desulfuromonas acetexigens and produced a maximum current density of 5 A/m2. Among the strains of the consortium, G. metallireducens and D. acetexigens were proven to be electroactive. Kiely et al. reported that anodic communities were completely different when air cathode MFCs were fed with different wastewaters [7]. For example, when potato wastewater was used, the MFC anodic community was dominated by Geobacter sulfurreducens, Geobacter lovleyi, Geothrix fermentax, and Pelobacter propionicus. The consortium that developed in the same MFCs fed with dairy wastewater was composed of Clostridium, Tauera, Pelobacter carbinolicus, and Parabacteroides. This observation confirmed that consortium composition depends strongly on the type of substrate used. Moreover, although large differences in Geobacter sp. abundances in investigated wastewaters (51% and 7% Geobacter sp. in potato and dairy wastewater, respectively), the amounts of power produced in MFCs fed with each type of wastewater were comparable (217 and 189 mW/m2 for potato and dairy wastewater, respectively). Recent investigations have shown that fungi or mixed consortia of fungi and bacteria allow for very specific wastewaters to be used as substrates in MFCs [8,9]. For example, Islam et al. used an artificial yeast-bacteria consortium (Lipomyces starkeyi with Klebsiella pneumoniae) in a dual-chamber MFC for production of electricity from oil palm mill effluent [10]. It was found that bacteria produced electron shuttles which were used by yeast, thus allowing for the production of a power density 6 times higher than that produced by each of these species separately. In the present study, we showed for the first time that it was possible to stimulate production of electricity from the substrates that could not be used earlier in MFC. In the investigations we used wood industry wastewater which was a substrate and a source of microorganisms, without any supplementation. Naturally-occurring consortium that was present in the investigated wastewater did not produce power in MFCs. After wastewater preconditioning we stimulated electrical current production by influencing the development of bacteria-fungi consortium. It has been shown that - by a proper consortium preconditioning – it is possible to trigger power production. Selecting the growth conditions of a consortium regulates its microbial composition and therefore facilitates production of power from substrates that could not previously be used in MFCs. This finding opens new direction in the investigations on regulation of mixed bacteria-fungi consortium development in order to enhance or stimulate current production from various substrates."
1,Materials and methods,
2,MFC construction and operation,"2.1 MFC construction and operation Air-cathode single-chamber MFCs were made in duplicates, as described in our previous work [11]. These MFCs were inoculated with wood hydrothermal treatment wastewater (WHTW) collected from a plywood plant basin in which hardwood logs were hydrothermally treated at 65 °C. The WHTW was kept at room temperature and introduced, in a 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, to MFC reactors working at 37 °C. When preconditioning was applied, WHTW was kept at a temperature of 45 °C for 2 weeks before introducing the MFCs. After that period of time, we observed the development of fungus in the wastewater. The preconditioned wastewater in 50 mM of PBS was transferred to the reactors working at 37 °C. The WHTW was used as a substrate and as a microorganism source without any nutrient additions. The reactors were operated in a fed-batch mode according to the procedure described earlier8. Power generation was measured after obtaining three repeatable voltage cycles. Electrical current generation and power generation in the MFCs were described by measuring voltage across a fixed external load (1000 Ω, unless stated otherwise) with an automated system connected to a computer. Current (I) was calculated using Ohm's law (I = V/R), and power (P) was calculated as P = IV. The current density and power density were normalized to the projected surface area of the cathode. In order to obtain the polarization curves, the external resistance was changed in a range of 100–3000 Ω."
3,Analyses of WHTW chemical composition,"2.2 Analyses of WHTW chemical composition Cellulose determination was made using the colorimetric method elaborated by Dubois et al. [12]). Lignin was assayed according to the method for acid-soluble lignin determination in wood and pulp [13]. A gas chromatography was used for quantitative analysis of alcohols, ketones, and acids (propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, valeric, and octanoic acid). A GC apparatus (Agilent 7890A, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with a mass spectrometer (Agilent MSD 5975C, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to perform this analysis. Injections of the test samples were made in the split mode (1:1) using a headspace analyzer (Agilent 7697A, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A capillary column (TGWAX-MS, Thermo, Scientific Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; 60 m × 0.32 mm × 0.50 μm) was used to separate the compounds. GC parameters were as follows: oven temperature was programmed to increase from 40 °C (5 min) to 80 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, then to 220 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, and maintained for 5 min; the flow rate of the carrier gas (helium) through the column was 1.2 mL/min; and the temperature of the injector was 250 °C. MS parameters were as follows: the ion source temperature was 230 °C, the transfer line temperature was 250 °C, the quadrupole temperature was 150 °C, and the ionization energy was 70 eV. Prior to analysis, a 20 mL headspace vial was filled with 7 mL of sample and closed tightly using an aluminum cap and septa. Headspace conditions were as follows: the oven temperature was 50 °C, the loop temperature was 60 °C, the transfer line temperature was 70 °C, the vial equilibration time was 20 min (with vial shaking), and the injection duration was 0.7 min. Prior to quantitative analysis, qualitative analyses of the alcohols, ketones, and acids were performed based on a comparison of their mass spectra with those of standard compounds and those in the NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectra Library (2012; Version 2.0 g). The identified compounds were quantified using calibration curves in the selected ion monitoring mode (SIM). Quantitative analysis was performed using Agilent MassHunter software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All analyses were performed in triplicates. For determinations of galacturonic acid, glucose, xylose, xylitol, lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, and levulinic acid content, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed with an Agilent 1260 Infinity liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a refractive index detector (RID). A Hi-Plex H column (7.7 × 300 mm, 8 µm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to separate compounds. The temperatures of the detector and the column were maintained at 55 and 60 °C, respectively. A mobile phase of 5 mM of H2SO4 was used at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Prior to analysis, all samples were pretreated with Carrez reagents to precipitate the proteins and prevent adsorption to the columns, thus preventing interference. After centrifugation, the liquid supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 µm PES (polyethersulphone) membrane. The volume of the sample injected on the column was 20 µL. All analyses were performed in triplicate."
4,Identification of microorganisms,"2.3 Identification of microorganisms A bacteria identification analysis was carried out according to a procedure described earlier, after 50 days of MFC operation [11]. A fungi metagenomic analysis was carried out on the basis of a hypervariable ITS1 region. ITS1FI2 and 5.8S were used for amplification of the chosen region and preparation of the library-specific primer sequences. The PCR reaction was carried out using a Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, according to producer recommendations. Sequencing was carried out on a MiSeq apparatus with MiSeq Reporter (MSR) v2.6. The analysis consisted of two stages: (1) automatic samples demultiplexing, and (2) generating FASTQ files that contain the raw readings. A bioinformatic analysis, which allowed for classification of the readings to the genera level, was carried out using QIIME software on the base of UNITE v7 reference sequences. This analysis consisted of the following stages: (1) deleting adaptor sequences (cutadapt program), (2) analysis of the quality of the readings and removal of low-quality sequences (cutadapt program), (3) joining paired sequences (fastq-join algorithm), (4) clustering on the base of the chosen base for reference sequences (unclust algorithm), (5) removing chimer sequences (usearch61 algorithm), and (6) assigning taxonomy to the chosen base of reference sequences (blast algorithm)."
5,Results,
6,Power production from wood hydrothermal treatment wastewater in MFCs,"3.1 Power production from wood hydrothermal treatment wastewater in MFCs The chemical composition of wood differs between particular tree species, but it is generally composed of cellulose (ca. 45%), hemicelluloses (ca. 30%), lignin (ca. 20%), and 2–5% extractives [14]. Wastewater generated during wood hydrothermal treatment contains mainly hydrophilic extractives, such as simple phenolics, tannins, catechins, various monosaccharides (i.e., glucose, xylose, galactose), disaccharides, alcohols, and acids. However, the chemical composition of wood hydrothermal treatment wastewater (WHTW) differs greatly between particular plywood plants. This fact is due to the variety of hydrothermal treatment conditions applied in different plants (i.e., different species of wood; hardwood or softwood), differences in the temperature and time of wood treatment, and differences in the frequency with which the basin wastewater is changed (which may range from weeks to years for different plants). For the present study, we used wastewater from a plant that used hardwood and changed the basin wastewater every few weeks. A chemical analysis of this substrate revealed that WHTW contains cellulose, lignin, carbohydrates, and a mixture of organic acids and alcohols (see Table 1 ). The most abundant compounds in WHTW were cellulose and lignin eluted from wood at 65 °C during hydrothermal treatment. Other compounds found in high concentrations included formic and acetic acids, which were generated during the hydrothermal treatment of wood. The raw wastewater was kept at room temperature, introduced to MFC reactors, and operated in a fed-batch mode. We observed very low voltage production, mostly not exceeding 50 mV, for 30 days; this allowed for the production of very low power from this substrate, ca. 1 mW/m2 (see Fig. 1 ). In order to stimulate electricity generation, we influenced the growth of a microbial consortium by incubating wastewater at a temperature of 45 °C before transferring it to the reactors. We assumed that such WHTW preconditioning could stimulate the growth of thermophilic microorganisms that would be able to utilize complex compounds present in wastewater and transform them into potential substrates for electrogens. After WHTW incubation, aliquots were introduced to the MFC reactors; since that time, we have observed fast voltage generation to the level of ca. 150 mV and further increase in voltage production to a maximum value of 450 mV (see Fig. 1). The maximum power density produced here was 334 mW/m2, which corresponded to 1 A/m2 of current density (see Fig. 2 a). After stabilization, current production was at a constant level of ca. 640 mA/m2 for 30 days (see Fig. 2b). After 30 days, we observed a decrease in current density, which was caused by the cathode fouling previously reported for air–cathode MFCs[15]. Pretreatment of an anodic inoculum was previously investigated by Rajesh et al., who applied nitroethane to suppress methanogenic microorganisms, resulting in a ca. 4-fold increase in power production [16]. Pretreatment of activated sludge with heat and acid has also been observed to increase its electricity producing capacity [17,18]."
7,Identification of microorganisms,"3.2 Identification of microorganisms Previous investigations of microbial consortia developed in MFCs were restricted to bacteria species only. In the present study, we decided to focus not only on bacterial species but also on the fungal species that might have developed in the wastewater, as fungi species may also be employed for electrical current production in MFCs as anode or cathode catalysts [19,8]. Moreover, fungi growing on wood are known to produce enzymes that enable decomposition of complex substances, such as cellulose or lignin, as well as simpler compounds that can be further used by bacteria [20,21]. An analysis of microorganisms revealed a preexisting mixed bacterial-fungal consortium composed of Saccharomycetes (99.9% fungi) and Bacilli (98.1% bacteria) in raw wastewater. The dominant fungal strain was a yeast (Candida xylopsoci) from the family Saccharomycetales and three species of the Lactobacillus genus (see Fig. 3 ). C. xylopsoci was the only fungal strain identified in raw wastewater, with a relative abundance of 99.8%. This strain was described to assimilate many substances, such as simple sugars (e.g., glucose, galactose, cellobiose, and xylose) and alcohols (e.g., ethanol and glycerol) [22]. Among species of the Lactobacillus genus, we mainly identified L. delbrueckii, with a relative abundance of 86%. This strain has been described in the literature as homofermenter, in that it converts simple sugars to lactic acid and its growth is stimulated by the presence of formic acid [23,24]. The raw WHTW consortium composed of Candida and Lactobacillus sp. did not allow for the development of conditions that are favorable to the evolution of electrogenic species or favorable to electrical current generation in MFCs. After preconditioning at 45 °C microbial consortium of wastewater changed and dominating microorganisms have become fungi of Trichocomaceae sp. (57% among fungi); there were also no identified bacteria species of the abundance above 5% (data not shown). As wastewater preconditioning resulted in power production, we investigated the composition of the consortium that developed in the anode (see Fig. 4 ). Among biofilm microorganisms, we identified Trichocomaceae sp. (74% of species identified in the Fungi kingdom). Within the Trichocomaceae family, belonging to the Eurotiales order, Aspergillus and Penicilium are well known for having the ability to adapt to extreme environments. Members of this family are known to degrade complex substances, such as cellulose or lignin, and produce organic acids [25]. We did not find the Candida species, which dominated raw wastewater; this indicates that WHTW preconditioning allowed for the development of Trichocomaceae, which ousted Candida. The accessibility of cellulose and lignin in WHTW was a key condition for the development of Trichocomaceae, which are able to decompose these substrates. Besides fungi, we also found representatives of Proteobacteria (53%) and Bacteroidetes (19%), which were not present in raw wastewater. At the class level, we identified Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria as well as Clostridia, among which Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant (25% and 19%, respectively). The identified species were Achromobacter insolitus (14% of bacteria species) of the Betaproteobacteria class and Geobacter sulfurreducens of the Deltaproteobacteria class (3%). A. insolitus is oxidase- and catalyse-positive and is mainly able to assimilate amino acids and organic acids [26]. Achromobacter species are also known to reduce chromium; this may suggest their potential electrogenic abilities [27]). Representatives of this genus have previously been found in the anodes of MFCs and have been acknowledged as electrogens [28]. G. sulfurreducens is a very well-known electrogen that uses acetate and hydrogen as electron donors for metal reduction [29]. This electrogen was the only unquestionable, confirmed electrogenic strain that we identified in the anode; this suggests that this strain was surely responsible for current production in the MFCs that were activated after preconditioning."
8,Removal of cellulose and production of intermediates,"3.3 Removal of cellulose and production of intermediates The wastewater used for the present study was a difficult substrate for current-producing bacteria, as without preconditioning power was not produced in MFCs from WHTW. Though presence of acetate in raw wastewater - main substrate for electrogens - current was not generated from raw WHTW. Wastewater preconditioning allowed for the development of Trichocomaceae sp., which we assumed would change the WHTW environment by degrading wood-derived compounds. Determination of the cellulose contents wastewaters that were raw, preconditioned, or working in MFCs confirmed our assumptions. WHTW preconditioning caused a decrease in cellulose concentration, which was further deepened due to MFC operation (see Fig. 5 ). Finally, the amount of cellulose was reduced from 280 to 100 mg/L after 73 days of MFC operation. The developed fungi did not show an ability to degrade lignin, as the amount of lignin remained at a comparable level, even after 2 months of MFC operation (see Fig. 5). Simultaneously, the concentration of glucose in the wastewater increased markedly after WHTW preconditioning and especially after working in MFCs (see Fig. 5). The peak concentration of glucose (50.38 mg/L) was measured in reactors working 2 months what was a 12-fold increase in comparison to raw wastewater (4.31 mg/L). As glucose can be converted into acids or alcohols by microorganisms, we measured the levels of these metabolites in wastewater samples incubated in different conditions. Although the amount of formic, acetic, and lactic acids remained at a comparable level in all tested conditions (57 ± 3, 46 ± 6, and 8 ± 1.5 mg/L, respectively), the concentrations of all measured higher acids increased after the development of Trichocomaceae occurred in the wastewater (see Fig. 6 ). In comparison to raw wastewater, we observed a ca. 2-fold increase in propionic, butyric, valeric, and octanoid acid production in preconditioned wastewater and a ca. 5-fold increase in acid production in wastewater taken from reactors that worked for 73 days. An interesting observation was made regarding galacturonic acid, which was measured in concentrations above 2 g/L in WHTW from MFCs working for 2 months (see Fig. 5). Galacturonic acid was present in neither raw nor preconditioned WHTW; this indicates that galacturonic acid was only generated under an external load in electrical current production conditions. Trichocomaceae development also resulted in higher alcohol generation, though their concentrations were much lower than in case of acids (see Fig. 7 ). While the peak total concentrations of acids were above 40 g/L, the maximum concentration of alcohols measured on the 73rd day of MFC operation was 1.4 g/L. For alcohols, we observed increases as high as 9-fold in the concentration of 1-octanol in WHTW on the 73rd day of MFC work in comparison to the concentration of 1-octanol in raw wastewater. This finding indicates that acid fermentation is a dominating pathway."
9,Discussion,"In our previous studies, we produced a power density of 71 mW/m2 directly from WHTW, without supplementation and affecting microbial consortium growth [11]). The wastewater used in previous studies was taken from basin where water had not been changed for 4 years (only the evaporated portion had been supplemented), whereas the wastewater used in the present study came from a frequently changed basin (every few weeks). It turned out that very low power (ca. 1 mW/m2) was produced when frequently changed raw wastewater was used in MFCs. We studied both fungal and bacterial species that developed in wastewater, thus allowing for the discovery that the consortium that exists naturally in WHTW was composed of the fungi C. xylopsoci and bacteria of the Lactobacillus sp. Though availability in raw WHTW acetate - the most popular electrogen substrate, this consortium was not able to acquire conditions favorable for current production in MFCs. Preconditioning of wastewater resulted in the development of a syntrophic fungi-bacteria consortium, Trichocomaceae sp. – Achromobacter insolitus – Geobacter sulfurreducens, in MFCs. The most important result of preconditioning was the creation of conditions that were favorable for the growth of Trichocomaceae sp., which decomposed complex substances in wastewater, especially cellulose decomposed into glucose, and fermented them into acids and alcohols. It was earlier reported in the literature that growth of Trichocomaceae sp. can be stimulated by temperature, e.g. increasing temperature from 30 °C to 40 °C allowed for ca. 2-fold increase in fungal population [30]. Moreover, activity of enzymes produced by the representatives of Trichocomaceae e.g. cellulases, hemicellulases, lipases was found to be the highest in the temperature range 40–50 °C what allows for more efficient use of organic matter present in wastewater [31,32]. For example, Aspergillus tereus lipase activity was 2-fold higher at 45 °C than at 20 °C [33] and acitivity of A. tereus cellulase was found to be the highest at 50 °C [34]. In turn, fungi growth at 45 °C and decomposition of complex substances present in wastewater, such as cellulose, allowed for development in MFC bacteria species using simple organics as well as electrogenic species. Cellulose hydrolysis and fermentation were enhanced under electrical current production conditions, as evidenced by increased acid and alcohol production throughout the MFC work time. We measured a high concentration of galacturonic acid in WHTW that had worked in MFCs; this acid appeared as a result of the hydrolysis of polygalacturonic acid building hemicelluloses extracted to WHTW during wood hydrothermal treatment. Trichocomaceae sp. seem to be responsible for polygalacturonic acid hydrolysis, as their representatives have been reported to produce polygalacturonases[35]. Interestingly, galacturonic acid was only measured in wastewater sampled from MFCs; this suggests that polygalacturonic acid hydrolysis took place only under current production conditions. This observation relates to previous reports that showed that polygalacturonases are sensitive to electric fields, which stimulate their mobility [36]. It is likely that galacturonic acid could be further converted to glycerol by Trichocomaceae and then converted to alcohols and acids through the pyruvate pathway reported for these fungi (see Fig. 8 ) [37,38]. Galacturonic acid could be also used by Achromobacter species [39]), which have been found to utilize this substrate and to ferment glucose [39]and oxidize propionate into acetic acid [40]. The concentration of acetate was at a constant level in raw, preconditioned, and MFC wastewaters; this may indicate that a constant acetate level was maintained by bacterial production, as this compound is very commonly used by most bacteria and fungi and is an obligatory substrate for Geobacter sulfurreducens development [29,41]. An electrical current was produced here, although the relative abundance of G. sulfurreducens in the anode biofilm was very low (only 3%). However, previous investigations have shown that only a small amount of electrogenic bacteria was sufficient for power production and that high electrogen abundance does not correlate with high power density [42,7] and power was also produced from wastewater without Geobacter’s participation [43]. A. insolitus might also have been engaged in current production via direct interspecies electron transfer with G. sulfurreducens, which was previously found to settle in close approximity to the anode (in accordance with the low abundance of Geobacter), while outer layers of the biofilm may be composed of other bacteria [41]. MFC-fed wastewater is a very complex system in which hydrolysis, fermentation, and electrogenesis run simultaneously and the products of these processes influence the microbial consortium which members influence mutually. The present investigation indicated that preconditioning of wastewater can be a crucial factor in regulating microbial consortium composition and can enable the production of electricity from substrates that would otherwise be impossible to utilize in MFCs. In the consortium developed by preconditioning, Trichocomaceae sp. were the key microorganisms in enabling current production from WHTW, as they decomposed cellulose, hemicellulose, and fermented glucose into higher acids and alcohols. G. sulfurreducens was responsible for current generation, and A. insolitus supported this consortium via electron transfer with Geobacter and by oxidizing propionate and galacturonic acid (see Fig. 9 ). We showed that optimization or stimulation of power production may be effectively run through substrate-consortium preconditioning before it is used in MFCs. This finding can be a starting point for further investigations on the regulation of consortium development to enhance or stimulate power production from various substrates in MFCs."
10,Industrial outlook,"4.1 Industrial outlook The heart of practical implementation of MFC technology in industrial practice is microorganisms’ efficient cooperation in syntrophic consortia. We showed that it was possible to steer consortium development through wastewater preconditioning. Proper adjusting the conditions of wastewater preconditioning allows for: (1) development of microorganisms that are able to increase efficiency of power production from difficult substrates or even (2) inducing power generation from the substrates that have not been usable for MFC technology before. Abovementioned findings open new possibilities in practical application of MFC technology for power production from various types of substrates and industrial wastes. The results demonstrate that much wider range of substrates may be used in MFC and more power may be recovered from the industrial wastes currently considered valueless. High cost of materials for the reactors and low power production are commonly considered as main limitations of MFC technology toward its practical application and up scaling [44]. The cost of 1 m2 of of air cathode - the most expensive element of air cathode reactor - was estimated on 1000$ [45]. So, the total cost of a single 200-L reactor that could be used in wood industry wastewater treatment would be around 2000–3000$ [46]. However, recent investigations indicate that cost limitations are possible e.g. through efficient cathode cleaning procedures which may extend its lifetime so such cathode can be used for many treatment cycles [47,48]. It was recently stated that MFC technology can be a real alternative to conventional wastewater treatment techniques. Trapero et al. presented detailed calculations proving MFC can be even more profitable than activated sludge for the treatment of wastewater [49]. The efficiency of power production obtained from wood industry wastewater in this work allows currently for generating 300 kW from single wood panel producing plant [50]. When we take into account the amount of wastewater generated by wood-based panel industry in a world scale, we could produce ca. 5 GW energy, if MFC technology was implemented. As the presented results are starting point in studies on stimulation of power production from WHTW in MFC through thermal pretreatment, future investigations focused on optimizing pretreatment conditions will lead to further increase of power production. Moreover, application of MFC technology would allow for elimination of conventional treatment techniques which are environmentally adverse (e.g. coagulation generates secondary wastewater pollution and production of toxic sludge) or energy-demanding (e.g. energy input in advanced oxidation processes reaches 11 kWh/kg COD [51]. Additionally, the energy produced in MFC during wastewater treatment in the form of electric current is considered as cleaner than the energy fixed in a biofuel from anaerobic digestion. Thus, MFC implementation allows for reducing carbon footprint in comparison to other technologies of wastewater treatement [52]."
11,Conclusions,"Usually, investigations on enhancing power production in microbial fuel cells are focused on reactor/material configuration or operational parameters of microbial fuel cell operation. The present study showed that inoculum pretreatment is equally important, as it may stimulate power production from substrates that were not useful for microbial fuel cells before. Wastewater pretreatment before introducing it to microbial fuel cells allows for the control of microbial consortium development toward energy production enhancement. We showed that wastewater preconditioning at 45 °C caused development of fungi of Trichocomaceae sp. which decomposed complex organic substances present in wastewater and allowed for acquiring in microbial fuel cell conditions favorable for the growth of electrogenic species. In microbial fuel cell fungi-bacteria mixed consortium Trichocomaceae sp. – Achromobacter insolitus – Geobacter sulfurreducens was developed which resulted in stimulation of power production 0.33 W/m2 from wastewater while no power was produced without preconditioning. The microorganims of the new consortium decomposed cellulose present in wastewater (cellulose amount decreased from 280 mg/L to 100 mg/L) into glucose (increased from ca. 4 mg/L to ca. 50 mg/L) and fermented it into acids and alcohols (e.g. concentration of propionic or butyric acid increased 5-fold while 1-octanol increased by 9-fold). Up until now, fungi identification in anode consortia was neglected. According to our knowledge, this is the first publication in which bacterial and fungal species were investigated in an anode biofilm consortium. We have proved cooperative growth of fungi and bacteria in a syntrophic consortium, which resulted in stimulation of power production from industrial wastewater. The results obtained in this study suggested that acquiring conditions necessary for the growth of specific species before starting power production in microbial fuel cells may help to decompose complex substrates and further enable the growth of electrogens. The role of fungi in the generation of electrical currents from complex substrates is bigger than was previously thought, and the degrading potential of fungi may be effectively utilized in microbial fuel cells. The presented research opens the way for future utilization of unexplored clean energy resources and indicates the direction how to increase energy recovery from wastewater with the use of microbial fuel cell technology."
