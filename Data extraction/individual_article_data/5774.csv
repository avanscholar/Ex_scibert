0,Introduction,"Lignocellulose is regarded as a renewable and low cost resource for producing fermentable sugars, which can be further utilized by microorganism for various chemicals and fuels production (Himmel et al., 2007). However, it is difficult to efficient enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars directly without pretreatment process due to its recalcitrance (Himmel et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2012). Various pretreatment technologies have been developed to overcome the recalcitrance of lignocellulose and improve its enzymatic conversion yield (Chen et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2018). Lignin and their linkage with hemicellulose are considered as the major barrier for limiting the accessibility of enzymes to polysaccharides in the plant cell (Ding et al., 2018; Kumar and Wyman, 2009; Shimizu et al., 2018; Yang and Wyman, 2004). Alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment is widely used as a pulping and bleaching method in papermaking industry, which has shown to remove most of lignin and part of hemicellulose while selectively retaining cellulose (Liu, 2003; Sun and Sun, 2002). Recently, AHP has drawn attention as a pretreatment in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels since it can efficiently increase the accessibility of enzymes to polysaccharides for obtaining high sugar yield (Alvarez-Vasco and Zhang, 2017; Li et al., 2018). Furthermore, AHP pretreatment has many potential advantages such as low capital costs, technical feasibility for large-scale production, and compatibility with enzymatic saccharification and fermentation (Alvarez-Vasco and Zhang, 2017; Banerjee et al., 2012). Despite improved accessibility to cellulose by AHP pretreatment, high cellulase dosage is still required for efficient enzymatic hydrolysis of AHP pretreated lignocellulose (Alvarez-Vasco and Zhang, 2017; Li et al., 2018). The hydrolytic efficiency and cost of enzymes are major factors that restrict the commercialization of cellulosic biofuel production processes. The hydrolytic efficiency of the cellulase is significantly limited by the crystalline nature of cellulose (Zhao et al., 2012). The transformation of crystalline cellulose to restructured cellulose III or amorphous cellulose is beneficial to improve cellulase hydrolytic efficiency, and the hydrolysis rates can be increased by up to about 5-fold (Chundawat et al., 2011). It has been reported that the crystalline structure of cellulose can hardly be disrupted by most thermochemical pretreatments such as AHP, dilute acid, hydrothermal, and organosolv (Chen et al., 2018; Chundawat et al., 2011; Li et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018). Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment is an effective method to increases the accessibility and digestibility of cellulose by the removal of lignin and the disruption of crystalline structure of cellulose (Carneiro et al., 2017; Goshadrou and Lefsrud, 2017; Raj et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). However, the high price of ILs is a primary obstacle to its commercial utilization on an industrial scale (Zhang et al., 2017). As one of the most efficient solvent system for cellulose dissolution, the low cost lithium chloride/N,N-dimethylacetamide (LiCl/DMAc) solvent can dissolve cellulose without derivatization, which has proven to be useful for modification of cellulose and the chemical analysis, while it was rarely used for pretreatment followed enzymatic hydrolysis (Alexandridis et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2014). In our previous study, wheat straw (WS) were pretreated by dilute acid and ethanol-dilute acid pretreatment before being dissolved in LiCl/DMAc solvent, and the regenerated parts were used for enzymatic hydrolysis (Qi et al., 2017). The dissolution ratio for untreated WS was only 37.90% at 160 °C for 3 h in LiCl/DMAc solvent. Although acid based pretreatment can improve the dissolution ratio and enzymatic saccharification of WS, the presence of a large amount of lignin in pretreated WS still restricted the dissolution and digestion of cellulose in WS (Qi et al., 2017). The combination AHP and LiCl/DMAc pretreatment may improve the dissolution and digestibility of cellulose in WS. Cellulose dissolved in LiCl/DMAc system has been widely reported, while little work focus on the dissolution of AHP pretreated samples, which also contained a large amount of xylan. Xylan, interlocks cellulose through hydrogen-bond, has a major part to play in preventing cellulase accessibility to cellulose (Penttila et al., 2013). To obtain more fermentable sugars, xylanase is usually added in the enzymatic saccharification process, which makes cellulose more accessible to cellulase (Alvira et al., 2011; Kumar and Wyman, 2009; Song et al., 2016). Different methods pretreated lignocellulosic materials were used to study the synergistic action of cellulase and xylanase, however, the mechanism behind this synergistic action during the enzymatic saccharification process is still unclear (Gonçalves et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2013; Jia et al., 2015; Kumar and Wyman, 2009). Understanding the synergistic hydrolysis mechanism of cellulase and xylanase is benefit for the development of efficient enzyme cocktails for the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, WS was pretreated via a novel combination of AHP and LiCl/DMAc pretreatment. The physicochemical structural changes of untreated and pretreated WS samples were investigated by Fourier transformed IR (FT-IR), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), scanning electron microscope (SEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Furthermore, the effect of delignification and decrystallization of WS on the hydrolytic efficiency and synergistic action of cellulase and xylanase were investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials WS was collected from Henan province, China. It was smashed into powder (40 ˜ 80 mesh) and then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 16 h before use. Xylanase (3310.70 IU/g) was obtained from SUNSON Industry Group Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Cellulase complex (92.44 FPU/m L) was kindly provided by Imperial Jade Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (Yinchuan, China)."
3,AHP pretreatment,"2.2 AHP pretreatment The WS was delignified with AHP solution (pH 11.5) containing 3% H2O2 in a glass reactor. The pH was adjusted with 5 M NaOH. The reaction with a solid to liquid ratio of 1:25 (g/m L) was carried out at 70 °C for 3 h. Then, the solid residue was filtered and the washed residue was pretreated again by AHP solution under the conditions described above. Finally, the filtered and washed residue was dried and milled for further use."
4,LiCl/DMAc pretreatment,"2.3 LiCl/DMAc pretreatment Delignified WS samples (5 g) were suspended into the solvent system of LiCl/DMAc (8%, w/w, 200 m L) and stirred for 2.5 h at 110 °C, and then for 12 h at room temperature. The dissolved samples were regenerated and washed with tap water. The regenerated samples were freeze-dried for further use."
5,Enzymatic hydrolysis,"2.4 Enzymatic hydrolysis Pretreated WS substrates were hydrolyzed at 2% (w/v) in citrate buffer solution (pH5.0, 50 mM) with 0.02% sodium azide on a thermomixer (50 °C, 800 rpm). Cellulase loadings were 5, 15, 25 FPU/g dry substrates. Xylanase loadings were 400 IU/g dry substrates. The enzymatic hydrolysis reactions were terminated by set the temperature of thermomixer at 99 °C for 5 min. The hydrolysates were centrifuged and filtered for further analysis. The enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of cellulose or xylan was calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) E n z y m a t i c h y d r o l y s i s e f f i c i e n c y o f c e l l u l o s e ( % ) = c g l u c o s e × 0.9 c s u b s t r a t e × c e l l u l o s e c o n t e n t i n s u b s t r a t e × 100 (2) E n z y m a t i c h y d r o l y s i s e f f i c i e n c y o f x y l a n ( % ) = c x y l o s e × 0.88 c s u b s t r a t e × x y l a n c o n t e n t i n s u b s t r a t e × 100 Where c substrate was the substrate loading, g/L, c xylose and c glucose were the xylose and glucose content in hydrolysate, g/L."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Based on the protocols described by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the chemical compositions of WS samples were determined by a two-step acid hydrolysis (Sluiter et al., 2008). The carbohydrate compositions in hydrolysates were analyzed by HPLC (Waters) with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad), which was eluted at 0.5 mL/min with H2SO4 solution (5 mM) at 55 °C. FT-IR was performed on a FT-IR spectrophotometer (TENSOR 27). FT-IR spectra of the WS samples were colleted over the wavenumbers of 4000–400 cm−1. The surface characteristics of WS samples were observed by SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). CP/MAS 13C-NMR spectra of the WS samples were obtained on an AVANCE III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. WS samples were scanned by XRD (PANalytical, X'PertPro MPD) at an applied voltage of 40 kV and a filament current of 40 mA over the angular range from 5° to 80°. The crystallinity index (CrI) of pretreated WS samples was estimated according to the Segal method (Segal et al., 1959)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of AHP and LiCl/DMAc pretreatment on the chemical composition,"3.1 Effect of AHP and LiCl/DMAc pretreatment on the chemical composition The composition changes of pretreated WS samples were illustrated in Table 1 . The compositions of WS were 35.64% cellulose, 26.16% xylan, 2.66% arabinan, and 17.93% klason lignin. AHP has been reported as a promising pretreatment method for the effective retention of cellulose and removal of lignin and xylan, which can enhance enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of substrates dramatically (Alvarez-Vasco and Zhang, 2017; Li et al., 2018). As can be seen, after AHP pretreatment alone, the content of cellulose increased to 71.82% because of the removal of 91.96% klason lignin and 64.93% xylan from WS samples. In our previous study, the dissolution ratio for untreated, dilute acid treated, and ethanol-dilute acid treated WS were 37.90%, 51.50%, and 77.50%, respectively, at 160 °C for 3 h in LiCl/DMAc solvent (Qi et al., 2017). Interestingly, the delignified WS samples by AHP pretreatment could be completely dissolved in LiCl/DMAc solvent at 110 °C for 2.5 h, suggested that lignin is the main barrier to restrict the dissolution of lignocellulose in LiCl/DMAc. The dissolving delignified samples in LiCl/DMAc could be precipitated and regenerated by pouring into the water. The compositions of regenerated samples were 72.12% cellulose, 17.95% xylan, and 1.95% klason lignin, which is similar to the compositions of the delignified WS samples. This result indicated that LiCl/DMAc pretreatment had minor effect on the chemical compositions of the delignified WS samples."
9,Structural characterization,"3.2 Structural characterization As shown in Fig. 1 , the untreated, AHP treated, and AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS substrates were analyzed by FT-IR. The peak at 1511 cm−1was attributed to the stretching of CC in lignin (Li et al., 2018). The peak at 1730 cm−1 was resulted from the stretching of CO ester in acetyl groups attached to xylan (Li et al., 2018). Compared with the untreated WS samples, the peak at 1730 cm−1, 1511 cm−1, and 831 cm-1 disappeared in the pretreated WS samples. The disappearance of these peaks indicated the deacetylation and delignification of WS samples by AHP pretreatment. However, similar FT-IR characteristic peaks were observed in AHP and AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples, suggesting little chemical changes occurred by LiCl/DMAc pretreatment, which could be a physical dissolution process. These results are consistent with the chemical compositions analysis results described above. It is commonly known that cellulose contains crystalline and amorphous regions. The crystalline region of cellulose with strong hydrogen bond action is more recalcitrant to enzymatic saccharification than the amorphous region (Zhao et al., 2012). The untreated and AHP treated WS samples exhibited a type of cellulose I (Fig. 2 ), indicating that AHP pretreatment cannot change the crystalline structure of cellulose in WS. The CrI of untreated and AHP pretreated WS was 47.91% and 61.83%, respectively. The increased crystallinity index for AHP treated WS was because of the removal of amorphous parts such as lignin and xylan from WS. After LiCl/DMAc pretreatment, the regenerated samples exhibited a broad peak, indicating the transformation of crystalline cellulose I into amorphous cellulose during the dissolution and regeneration process. The physicochemical structure of untreated and pretreated substrates was investigated by solid-state 13C NMR (Fig. 3 ), which can give valuable information about structural changes of lignocellulosic biomass (Sun et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2016). The signals at 22 ppm (CO) and 172 ppm (CO conjugates) originated from the acetyl group of xylan were observed clearly in the spectrum of WS. In addition, the signals at 56 ppm derived from the OCH3 of lignin were clearly found in WS substrates. All the peaks described above are disappeared in AHP treated WS spectrum, indicating the removal of lignin and hemicellulose from WS by AHP pretreatment. The signal at 105 ppm was assigned to the C-1of cellulose. The strong signal at 74 ppm corresponded to the C-5, C-3, and C-2 of cellulose. The signals at 65 ppm and 89 ppm belonged to the C-6 and C-4 of the crystalline cellulose, respectively, which were found in untreated and AHP treated WS samples. The signals at 63 ppm and 84 ppm originated from the C-6 and C-4 of the amorphous cellulose, respectively, which were observed in AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples. These results indicated the crystalline cellulose had been completely transformed to amorphous cellulose after LiCl/DMAc pretreatment. The XRD and 13C NMR results indicated that the main changes of WS were the removal of amorphous parts during AHP pretreatment and the disruption of crystalline cellulose during LiCl/DMAc pretreatment. The surface structure of untreated, AHP treated, and AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples were observed by SEM (Fig. 4 ). It can be seen that the surface of WS samples exhibit a flat and rigid morphology structure. After AHP pretreatment, the morphology of AHP treated samples became loose and disordered with exposed cellulose fibers, indicated that the structure of WS was destroyed. Interestingly, the morphology of AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated and regenerated samples was significantly changed, displaying a smooth and homogeneous macrostructure. The SEM results indicated that the dissociated cellulose fibers with contained xylan during AHP pretreatment could be dissolved in LiCl/DMAc solvent and redistributed after regeneration process in anti-solvent."
10,Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated WS,"3.3 Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated WS As shown in Fig. 5 , AHP treated and AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples were hydrolyzed by different cellulase loadings. The cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of AHP treated WS samples was only 21.81% after 72 h hydrolysis at low cellulase loading (5 FPU/g). With cellulase loading increased, higher cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiencies (61.63% at 15 FPU/g and 84.32% at 25 FPU/g) were found after 72 h hydrolysis. Surprisingly, the cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples reached to 32.48% after 6 h incubation at low cellulase loading (5 FPU/g), which is higher than the cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of AHP treated WS samples after 6 h incubation at high cellulase loading (25 FPU/g). After 72 h hydrolysis, the cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples were 68.58%, 89.69%, and 96.59%, respectively, at 5 FPU/g, 15 FPU/g, and 25 FPU/g enzymes loading. Compared to AHP treated WS samples, the cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency for AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples at different cellulase loadings were improved by 214.42%, 45.53%, and 14.55%, respectively, after 72 h hydrolysis. The transformation of crystalline cellulose to restructured amorphous cellulose significantly enhanced the hydrolytic efficiency of cellulase, especially at low cellulase loading. The cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of AHP treated WS samples increased as the incubation time increased to 72 h, while the cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples reached to the maximum at 48 h, indicating shorter incubation time for enzymatic saccharification process which can reduce the cost of the biofuel production. The xylan enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of treated WS samples increased as enzyme loading increased. After 72 h hydrolysis, the xylan enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency for AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples at different cellulase loadings were improved by 65.01%, 29.12%, and 8.05%, respectively, compared to AHP treated WS samples. The result indicated that LiCl/DMAc pretreatment could also improve the enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan, especially at low cellulase loading. The xylan enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples was 78.52% after 72 h hydrolysis when cellulase loading was 25 FPU/g, indicating the insufficient of xylanase in commercial cellulase. The xylan enzymatic hydrolysis efficiencies of AHP and AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples were 13.86% and 21.64%, respectively, by xylanase alone, which was not able to hydrolyze cellulose from treated WS samples. The synergistic actions between xylanase and cellulase during the enzymatic saccharification of AHP treated and AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples are shown in Fig. 6 . The maximum cellulose and xylan enzymatic hydrolysis efficiencies of AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples reached up to 97.49% and 87.80%, respectively, by adding cellulase and xylanase simultaneously. Reducing the dosage of cellulase is also one of strategies to obtain economically successful for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. At the same level of xylanase addition, the cellulase loading at 15 FPU/g obtained comparable cellulose and xylan enzymatic hydrolysis efficiencies with cellulase loading at 25 FPU/g for all treated WS samples, indicating the reduction of the dosage of cellulase by using xylanase. By the addition of xylanase in cellulase, the cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency for AHP treated WS samples at different cellulase loadings (5 FPU/g, 15 FPU/g, 25 FPU/g) increased by 113.77%, 45.17%, and 9.68%, respectively. To our surprise, by the addition of xylanase in cellulase, the cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency for AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples at different cellulase loadings (5 FPU/g, 15 FPU/g, 25 FPU/g) increased only by 8.48%, 7.12%, and 0.93%, respectively. Furthermore, the xylan enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency for AHP treated WS samples at different cellulase loadings (5 FPU/g, 15 FPU/g, 25 FPU/g) increased by 111.54%, 51.34%, and 17.21%, respectively, while the xylan enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency for AHP-LiCl/DMAc treated WS samples at different cellulase loadings (5 FPU/g, 15 FPU/g, 25 FPU/g) increased by 55.66%, 19.48%, 11.82%, respectively. Obviously, these results indicated that the synergistic effect of xylanase and cellulase decreased with cellulase loading increased in the hydrolysis of pretreated WS. More importantly, these results also suggested that the synergistic effect of xylanase and cellulase was significantly reduced by LiCl/DMAc pretreatment, especially for cellulose hydrolysis. LiCl/DMAc solvent can be efficient at dissolving cellulose by disrupting and breaking the intramolecular hydrogen bond network (Zhang et al., 2014). Obviously, the hydrogen bond between cellulose and xylan was also disrupted by LiCl/DMAc pretreatment considering it could dissolve AHP pretreated WS completely. The accessibility of cellulase to cellulose is limited by the hydrogen bonded xylan (Jeoh et al., 2007). Many studies showed that the addition of xylanase in cellulase significantly boosted the digestion of cellulose in lignocellulosic biomass pretreated by various pretreatment technologies (Gonçalves et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2013; Jia et al., 2015; Kumar and Wyman, 2009). However, the key factor influences the synergistic action of xylanase and cellulase was not clearly demonstrated. In this work, AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreatment technology assisted by enzymatic hydrolysis indicated that the hydrogen bond present in cellulose and xylan is one of the key factors on determining the synergistic action of xylanase and cellulase."
11,Mass balance of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis process,"3.4 Mass balance of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis process A mass balance of WS for the AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis process is shown in Fig. 7 . After AHP pretreatment, 46.50 g of total solid was recovered from 100 g WS, mainly composed of 33.39 g cellulose, 9.17 g xylan, and 3.70 g klason lignin. The yield of total sugars was 28.28 g/100 g WS (glucose 22.86 g/100 g WS and xylose 5.86 g/100 g) in enzymatic hydrolysis of AHP pretreated WS by cellulase (15 FPU/g) at 72 h. The main components of AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreated WS (45.76 g) were 33.00 g cellulose, 8.21 g xylan, and 3.02 g klason lignin. The yield of total sugars reached up to 39.62 g/100 g WS (glucose 32.89 g/100 g WS and xylose 6.73 g/100 g WS) under the same enzymatic hydrolysis condition. The LiCl/DMAc pretreatment caused only minor effects on the compositions of AHP pretreated WS, but significantly improved the yield of glucose, indicating amorphous cellulose was more susceptible to hydrolysis than crystalline cellulose. The addition of xylanase (400 IU/g) could efficient enhance the yield of total sugars (42.00 g/100 g WS) for AHP pretreated WS. However, the yield of total sugars (43.27 g/100 g WS) for AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreated WS did not increase too much by the addition of xylanase. The results indicated that the hydrogen bond present in cellulose and xylan plays an important role in enzymatic saccharification process. Cellulase mainly consists of exoglucanase, endoglucanase and glucosidase. The major enzyme component of current fungus-derived commercial cellulase preparations is exoglucanase, which appears to hydrolyze crystalline cellulose (Liu et al., 2011). However, the major component in AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreated WS is amorphous cellulose. In order to achieve high sugar yield at low costs, the enzyme components of cellulase need to be further optimized for AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreated WS. Furthermore, although the price of LiCl/DMAc solvent is much cheaper than ionic liquids, the costs for recovery of the LiCl/DMAc solvent are not cheap (Morgenstern and Kammer, 1996). However, Dupont company claimed that they had quite thoroughly overcome the technology for recovery and recycle of LiCl/DMAc by using chloroform extraction system, which appears to have possible commercial potential (Turbak, 2001). Besides that, establishing a method for recycling and reusing LiCl/DMAc solvent is also important for reducing the costs of AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreatment. The anti-solvent (water) used in regeneration process can be replaced by commonly used alcohol, which can be easily distillated and recovered after removing precipitated substrate from the pretreatment media, and then the LiCl/DMAc solvent can be recycled and reused for pretreatment (Seoud et al., 2000; Yuan et al., 2018)."
12,Conclusions,"The enzymatic saccharification efficiency of WS was dramatically enhanced via a combination of AHP and LiCl/DMAc pretreatment. Interestingly, the AHP treated WS could be completely dissolved in LiCl/DMAc solution. Moreover, the synergistic effect between cellulase and xylanase was significantly reduced due to the disruption of hydrogen bond in cellulose and xylan by LiCl/DMAc solvent. The hydrogen bond present in cellulose and xylan is one of the key factors on determining the synergistic action of xylanase and cellulase, which also plays an important role in enzymatic saccharification process. The combined pretreatment technology can obtain high sugar yield using low cellulase dosage and short incubation time by effective delignification and completely deconstructing the crystalline structure of cellulose in WS. Overall, this study provides a promising pretreatment strategy for the efficient enzymatic hydrolysis of WS into fermentable sugars."
