0,Introduction,"Biomass is a renewable and abundantly available feedstock for the production of biofuels and chemicals [1]. Pyrolysis is a thermal method for the conversion of solid biomass in absence of oxygen into a condensable liquid named as pyrolysis oil or bio-oil [2]. Bio-oil is a mixture of hundreds of chemicals [3]. It has some deleterious properties such as a high viscosity, a high water content, a high instability and a high corrosiveness [4,5]. These undesirable properties make the direct use of bio-oil as the fuel for transportation difficult. Although the composition of bio-oil depends on the feedstock and the pyrolysis conditions [6–8], majority of these organic compounds have the oxygen-containing functionalities. This leads to a low heating value and a high instability of bio-oil [9,10]. Bio-oil thus has to be stabilized and be upgraded to improve its properties for the use as the fuel for vehicles [11–13]. Among the various oxygen-containing organics in bio-oil, the carboxylic acids received particular attention as they are the main origin of the corrosiveness of bio-oil. Moreover, the carboxylic acids are also the catalysts for the polymerization of bio-oil [14–16]. Esterification is effective for the transformation of the carboxylic acids in bio-oil into neutral esters via the acid treatment of bio-oil in alcohols. Esterification of bio-oil was generally performed at the temperature under 250°C, as at higher reaction temperature (i.e. 400°C) cracking of the components in bio-oil became dominant [17,18]. Under the conditions of esterification, not only the carboxylic acids but also many other components such as aldehydes, sugars, furans and some phenolics are converted, via distinct reaction routes. These reactions together drastically modify the composition of bio-oil, improve the stability and alleviate the polymerization of bio-oil during the further hydrotreatment [19]. Acid catalyzed conversion of bio-oil in alcohols has significant importance in biorefinery. It significantly changes the composition of the bio-oil produced from upstream pyrolysis and modifies the reaction behaviours of bio-oil in the downstream hydrotreatment. Reaction temperature significantly affects the conversion routes of most of the components in bio-oil. Generally, below, esterification is predominant pathways for the acid-treatment of bio-oil in alcohols. While above 400°C, the components of bio-oil mainly undergo catalytic cracking. Because of the unique importance, it is necessary to revisit and review the research work dealing with esterification of bio-oil. Ciddor et al. have recently reviewed the catalytic esterification of bio-oil but with a special focus on catalysts [20]. Little attention has been paid on the reaction network, which is the key to understand how esterification impacts the composition of bio-oil. This review focuses on the reaction pathways of the individual components of bio-oil including carboxylic acids, aldehydes, furans, sugars, phenolics, terpenoids, N-containing organics and metal species during esterification. Other aspects of esterification such as the process employed (i.e. inline esterification, esterification in olefins/alcohols, esterification coupled with pre-oxidation or hydrogenation, reactive distillation) will also be discussed. The catalysts used in bio-oil esterification will be briefly mentioned. The work from the authors of this study will be biased, especially in the sections about the reaction network during bio-oil esterification. Some other relevant review papers were also mentioned here for reference. Mohan et al. have reviewed the progress in pyrolysis of biomass for bio-oil production [21]. Asadieraghi et al. [22], Tan et al. [23], and Park et al. [24] have reviewed the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass. Chen et al. have reviewed the research progresses in stabilisation of bio-oil during storage [25]. Hydrotreatment of bio-oil was reviewed by Elliott in 2007 [26] and more recently by Wang et al. [27]."
1,Esterification of the bio-oil derived model compounds,"Acid catalyst is generally required for esterification of the carboxylic acids in bio-oil. Under the conditions of esterification, the acid catalyst could also catalyze a number of other reactions including transesterification, acetalization, etherification, oligomerization, aldol condensation, dehydration/decomposition of sugars/furans and polymerization reactions. These reactions together make the reaction network in esterification of bio-oil very complex. In order to understand the reaction behaviour of a specific component during the acid treatment, it is much easier to start the investigation by a model-compound approach. Besides, model-compound experiment is also commonly performed to evaluate performance of catalysts [28–33] or the processes for esterification of bio-oil [34–37]. As shown in Table 1 , the esterification of the different acids including acetic acid, fatty acids and levulinic acid were investigated. These acids all can be effectively esterified but their relative reactivities towards esterification could not be compared here due to the different catalysts and reaction conditions used. Instead of esterification of the acids in alcohols, esterification of the carboxylic acid in phenolics has also been attempted. Milina et al. investigated the esterification of acetic acid with o-cresol (Fig. 1 ) [33]. This proposed esterification method has significant importance, as the phenolics are one of the most abundant components in bio-oil. The use of the phenolic compounds to esterify the carboxylic acids in bio-oil does not require external alcohols, which has an unprecedented advantage. However, the conversion of acetic acid could reach only ca. 60% at 200°C in o-cresol. At this high temperature, polymerization reactions also took place. The conversion of acetic acid was not high enough over the catalysts tested in the study. It has not been understood yet about the activity of other catalysts for this reaction. More effort (i.e. developing more active catalysts) is required to further develop this method. The carboxylic acids in bio-oil could also react with the alcohols formed from the in-situ hydrogenation of the aldehydes in bio-oil. Tang et al. developed a one-step hydrogenation/esterification method to convert the aldehydes into alcohols via an initial hydrogenation step [35]. The carboxylic acids then reacted with the produced alcohols to form esters via esterification (Fig. 2 ) [35]. Using the same philosophy, the hydrogenation/esterification of furfural or other aldehydes with acetic acid were also investigated [36]. The main advantage of this method is that there is no need to use external alcohols for esterification. However, the amount of aldehydes in bio-oil may not be abundant enough to produce enough alcohols to esterify the carboxylic acids in bio-oil. The reactivity of the produced alcohols with the acids also needs to be considered to optimize the process to maximize the output of this method. Aldehydes are an important component of bio-oil. Lohitharn and Shanks found that, during esterification, acetaldehyde affected the conversion of acetic acid, especially at the low reaction temperatures (50–70°C) [32]. The acetalization and esterification took place simultaneously and competed for the same acidic sites, affecting the conversion of each other. Higher reaction temperature (100°C) enhanced the reaction rates for both the esterification and acetalization, and the competition became insignificant. In bio-oil, not only aldehydes but also many other reactants such as furans, sugars and phenolics compete for the same acidic sites during the acid treatment of bio-oil. This would also affect the conversion of carboxylic acids, which, however, has not been fully understood yet. Except the conversion of aldehydes via acetalization, Ye et al. investigated the alkylation of acetaldehyde with 2-methylfuran (Fig. 3 ) [31]. The 2,2′-ethylidenebis(5-methylfuran) formed via the alkylation method are more stable than the corresponding acetal. However, the alkylation as a method for the conversion of aldehydes has not been confirmed yet in bio-oil. Many compounds in bio-oil could be converted via the alkylation reactions and they would possibly compete with alkylation of acetaldehyde."
2,Esterification of bio-oil via various methods,
3,Esterification of bio-oil in alcohols,"3.1 Esterification of bio-oil in alcohols Esterification of bio-oil in alcohols is a primary method to deal with the corrosiveness of bio-oil. The amounts of alcohols in bio-oil are generally not able to esterify the carboxylic acids effectively. Addition of alcohols to bio-oil is adopted to perform the esterification in many research works, as shown in Table 2 [38–71]. The alcohols used include methanol [40–42,45–51,55,69,70], ethanol [38,39,42–45,60,64–67,69,71], 1-butanol [41,52,53,55–58,61,62,68], ethylene glycol [64] and glycerol [44]. These alcohols could effectively convert the carboxylic acids in bio-oil. However, depending on the mass ratio between alcohols and bio-oil, a significant amount of alcohols may not be involved in the esterification reaction, and they need to be separated and recycled. Alcohol (i.e. methanol, ethanol) is generally a good solvent for bio-oil and thus the separation of alcohol from bio-oil after esterification is difficult. Distillation could separate alcohol together with the light components such as ethers, esters and some water from the heavy fractions of bio-oil. However, distillation is energy intensive. How to separate the alcohols from bio-oil cost-efficiently is a problem to be solved. In addition, the use of alcohols for esterification may bring another problem, the additional water produced via the etherification. Under the acidic conditions, alcohols could react with not only acids, but also with each other via inter-molecular etherification. This reaction consumes alcohols and produces the additional water that negatively affects the conversion of the carboxylic acids in bio-oil. Under the condition of esterification, many other types of reactions take place in parallel with the transformation of the carboxylic acids via esterification. For example, the transesterification, etherification, acetalization, dehydration of sugars, degradation of furans and conversion of phenolics have been observed [48]. However, these results were mainly based on the GC-MS detectable components (the light components). The reaction pathways of the heavy components have not been understood yet due to the difficulty for identifying them. Without understanding the reaction behaviours of the heavy components, it is difficult to fully understand how esterification affects the composition and the reaction behaviours of the esterified bio-oil, which is a knowledge gap to be filled. Esterification involves the use of acid catalyst, which is one focus in many studies. Another focus is the development of new methods with the aim of overcoming the problems associated with bio-oil esterification. These methods include the esterification under reduced pressure (reactive distillation) or with simultaneous water removal [52–55], in-line esterification [60], esterification in olefins/alcohols [57–59], pre-oxidation coupled with esterification [61,62] and esterification coupled with hydrogenation [63–71], which will be discussed below."
4,Esterification of bio-oil coupled with on-line extraction and distillation,"3.2 Esterification of bio-oil coupled with on-line extraction and distillation To eliminate the negative effect of water on the conversion of the carboxylic acids in bio-oil, Qin et al. employed a set up with a knockout trap to perform the esterification coupled with online extraction (Fig. 4 ) [52]. In the experiment, bio-oil was loaded in the water knockout trap, while 1-butanol and sulfuric acid were loaded in the round-bottom flask. The vapor of 1-butanol was condensed in the water knockout trap to extract the acids and aldehydes. Later 1-butanol and the extractives were fluxed back to the four-necked bottom flask where the esterification took place. Via this way, the water could be totally removed with >97% of acetic acid conversion and 100% of aldehyde conversion. Sundqvist et al. employed the azeotropic distillation to remove the water in bio-oil both prior to and during esterification [55]. A hydrocarbon entrainer (n-heptane or petroleum ether) was needed to achieve the efficient removal of water. After the esterification, pH of the products was increased to 4.0–5.6. Mahfud et al. used a similar set up to perform the reactive distillation [53]. A high boiling-point alcohol like n-butanol and a solid acid catalyst were used at 50–80°C under reduced pressure (<10kPa). Via this way, the water in bio-oil can be constantly removed, and the desired reactions (esterification and acetalization) were driven to completion. In the end, the water content in the pyrolysis oil was reduced to <5wt.%. Wang et al. investigated the removal of water in bio-oil via vacuum distillation [54], but an additional deep-water removal using ethyl chloride extraction was included. Via the above reactive distillation method, a very high conversion of acids could be achieved. However, the energy balance of the whole process needs to be evaluated. In addition to distillation, Wang et al. used a molecular distillation method to obtain a bio-oil fraction rich in carboxylic acids and ketones [56]. Molecular distillation is an effective method to remove water and other light components in bio-oil."
5,Esterification of bio-oil in olefin/alcohol,"3.3 Esterification of bio-oil in olefin/alcohol During the esterification of bio-oil, the presence of a significant amount of water (ca. 20–40%) makes the complete conversion of the carboxylic acids difficult, due to the reaction equilibrium between the acids and the water [48]. The hydration of olefin in bio-oil consumes the water in bio-oil and simultaneously produces the alcohols for the esterification. Zhang et al. employed this approach for the esterification of bio-oil, aiming to simultaneously reduce both the water content and the acidity, and to increase hydrophobicity and heating value of bio-oil [58,59]. Phase separation was observed if olefin was used as the sole reactant, which leads to the insufficient conversion of the olefins and severe coke formation. If additional 1-butanol was used, the conversion of the olefins was increased significantly due to the reduced mass transfer limitations. The hydration of olefins facilitated the esterification of the carboxylic acids as more alcohols were produced in the reaction medium. Alcohols could suppress the polymerization of sugars under the conditions of esterification. It is believed that alcohols could also stabilize other reactive components in bio-oil, thus suppressing the coke formation. The reaction network is very complex during the esterification in 1-octene/1-butanol, as shown in Fig. 5 . The acid-catalyzed electrophilic addition reactions of carboxylic acids, phenolic compounds, alcohols and water with the olefins took place simultaneously. These reactions together lead to a bio-oil with higher abundance of ethers, alkylated phenols, esters and alcohols, making bio-oil less hydrophilic. 1-butanol, as the co-esterification regent, reacts with the acids via esterification and the aldehydes via acetalization. Reaction equilibriums of these reactions were further driven to the ester/acetal direction by the consumption of water via hydrolysis of the added olefins. The high reactivity of olefins toward hydrolysis at the low reaction temperatures is very important for minimizing the polymerization of bio-oil."
6,Esterification of bio-oil coupled with pre-oxidation,"3.4 Esterification of bio-oil coupled with pre-oxidation During the storage of bio-oil or at elevated reaction temperature, the aldehydes in bio-oil could undergo spontaneous oligomerization reactions with phenols, affecting the stability of bio-oil [72]. To solve this issue, Xu et al. developed an ozone oxidation method to transform the aldehydes in bio-oil into acids [61]. After the oxidation, the carboxylic acids in the original bio-oil and the carboxylic acids formed from the oxidation of the aldehydes were esterified together in alcohols. The results showed that the acid number of bio-oil was increased from 45.4 to 118.4mg KOH/g after the ozone oxidation. The oxidized bio-oil also had a higher thermal stability during the esterification, but the ozone oxidation did not remarkably reduce the average molecular weight of the bio-oil. Tanneru et al. tested oxidative pre-treatment of bio-oil prior to esterification with the aim to identify the effective oxidative regent for maximizing the production of carboxylic acids [62]. The bio-oil was pretreated with ozone/H2O2, ozone alone and H2O2 alone, respectively. It was found that the ozone/H2O2 pretreatment produced the bio-oil with the highest acid value, increasing from 90.3mg KOH/g in the original bio-oil to 165.4mg KOH/g in the oxidized bio-oil. After the subsequent esterification, the resultant product had a HHV of 35.3MJ/kg, which was much higher than that of the raw bio-oil (16.0MJ/kg). The viscosity was also reduced significantly from 25.9 to 10.1, while the oxygen content and acid value were reduced by 71.4% and 81.9%, respectively. The pre-oxidation is a new approach to transform the aldehydes in bio-oil, which removes the reactive aldehydes and increases the formation of esters via the following esterification. Under the oxidative atmosphere and at the elevated reaction temperatures, it is believed that, in addition to aldehydes, other components of bio-oil are probably also oxidized. This will significantly modify the composition and the reaction behaviors of bio-oil. Effects of the pre-oxidation on reaction network of the typical components in bio-oil worth further investigation. In addition, the overall economical viability of the whole process needs to be evaluated as the chemicals involved in the pre-oxidation process could be costly."
7,In-line esterification of bio-oil,"3.5 In-line esterification of bio-oil Hilten et al. have developed an in-line esterification method by coupling biomass pyrolysis with reactive condensation [60]. The esterification of bio-oil was incorporated into a pyrolysis reactor (Fig. 6 ), aiming to reduce the acidity of bio-oil and to improve the quality of bio-oil in-situ. In this approach, ethanol was atomized into a stream of bio-oil vapor to esterify the carboxylic acids in the absence of an external acid catalyst. The reaction temperature ranged from 114 to 127°C and the short residence time (ca. 1min) were used. The acid concentration in the esterified bio-oil was decreased by ca. 42%, and the pH was increased from 2.48 to 3.05 after the in-line esterification. In addition, acetalization of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde also took place simultaneously. These reactions together improved the viscosity and cold flow properties of the bio-oil. The rapid quench of bio-oil in ethanol also prevented the secondary reactions and stabilized the reactive species, improving the stability of bio-oil during the storage. The in-line esterification was a successful attempt to reduce the acidity of bio-oil in the upstream pyrolysis, though less than half of the total acetic acid was converted. Optimizing the process would expect to further reduce the concentration of acetic acid. Gayubo et al. have confirmed that co-feeding of bio-oil and methanol (ca. 70wt.%) in a catalytic cracking process can reduce the deposition of pyrolytic lignin within and outside the catalyst particles, minimizing the formation of both the thermal coke and catalytic coke [59]. Hence, the bio-oil obtained from the in-line esterification might have a lower tendency towards coke formation in hydrotreatment, which needs to be further investigated."
8,Esterification of bio-oil in supercritical alcohols,"3.6 Esterification of bio-oil in supercritical alcohols Esterification of bio-oil under sub-critical conditions is able to convert the carboxylic acids in bio-oil, but the phenolics may not be significantly converted due to the relatively low reaction temperature [48]. Esterification in supercritical alcohols (at higher reaction temperature) helps to convert the phenolics in bio-oil. Peng et al. investigated the upgrading of bio-oil in sub- and super-critical ethanol using HZSM-5 as the catalyst [63,64]. It was found that the super-critical esterification was more effective than the sub-critical esterification. The HZSM-5 catalyst with the low Si/Al ratio has a stronger acidity and could effectively crack the heavy organics in the bio-oil. The potential coke (residue after distillation) was decreased remarkably after the super-critical upgrading, as the heavy components were cracked. Supercritical esterification of the bio-oil with aluminum silicate as the catalyst achieved the similar results [63]. The amounts of the acids, aldehydes, phenols, ketones and heavy components were decreased significantly after the supercritical esterification. HZSM-5 played a vital role for the conversions of these components. The supercritical esterification are generally performed at higher reaction temperatures (i.e. >250°C), and hence the reaction network may be different from those performed at the subcritical conditions (i.e. <200°C). More effort is required to fully understand how the supercritical esterification influences the composition and the stability of bio-oil. One potential problem for supercritical esterification may be the etherification reaction between the alcohols, which depends on the acidity of the acid catalyst and the reaction temperature. The etherification reaction consumes alcohols and produces more water and more volatile ethers, which results in a higher vapor pressure. Using weak solid acid catalyst may help to suppress the etherification reactions, which, however, will also negatively affect other acid-catalyzed reactions. In addition, the supercritical esterification requires a relatively high pressure. The high pressure helps to retain the reactive components in the liquid phase, which might affect the reaction equilibrium."
9,Esterification of bio-oil coupled with hydrogenation,"3.7 Esterification of bio-oil coupled with hydrogenation Esterification could effectively transform the carboxylic acids in bio-oil into neutral esters. However, esterification could not eliminate the unsaturated functionalities that lead to the instability of bio-oil. Thus, hydrogenation and esterification were coupled to simultaneously transform the acids and to eliminate the unsaturated functionalities [71]. Dang et al. investigated the effects of the reaction parameters on the upgrading of bio-oil via hydrogenation/esterification [71]. It was found that the higher initial hydrogen pressure and the higher mass ratio of ethanol to bio-oil help to minimize the coke formation. Increasing the reaction temperature enhanced the heating value of bio-oil, but also greatly promoted the coke formation. Xu et al. investigated the role of alcohol in the hydrogenation/esterification of bio-oil [68]. It was found that the use of supercritical alcohol enhanced the quality of the product when compared with that in using no solvent or employing subcritical conditions. Alcohol solvent could effectively suppress the coke formation (0.2% with an alcohol solvent versus 9.9% without an alcohol solvent). Further to this, alcohols also played multiple roles including being the reaction medium and the reactant, facilitating the dissolution of hydrogen, protecting the catalyst and improving properties of the product. The main reactions involved in the upgrading of bio-oil in the supercritical alcohol primarily include esterification, etherification, acetalization, hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Zhang et al. investigated the hydrogenation/esterification of bio-oil over Ni/SiO2-ZrO2 catalyst [67]. The results showed that the coke formation could be effectively suppressed in the alcohols and the lignin-derived oligomers contained in the crude bio-oil were further depolymerized. One important benefit of hydrogenation/esterification is the suppression of coke formation in alcohol at the elevated reaction temperature (i.e. >250°C). Another benefit is the elimination of the unsaturated functionalities such as the carbonyl groups and the aliphatic carbon-carbon double bonds, contributing to the stabilization of bio-oil. However, during the hydrogenation/esterification, the use of bifunctional catalysts could potentially enhance the cost. Another challenge is the complexity of the reaction network involved, understanding of which will be crucial for the optimization of the reaction parameters to maximize the production of the desired products."
10,Catalysts and reactors for esterification of bio-oil,
11,Catalysts for bio-oil esterification,"4.1 Catalysts for bio-oil esterification Esterification could hardly take place without the use of an acid catalyst, especially at low reaction temperature [47]. Although bio-oil intrinsically contains carboxylic acids, their acidities are not strong enough to catalyze the esterification reactions [48]. Both acid catalysts and base catalysts can catalyze esterification of bio-oil [43]. Conversion of acetic acid over the solid base catalyst such as K2CO3/Al2O3-NaOH was far lower than that over the solid acid catalyst SiO2/TiO2-SO4 2− [43]. Majority of the research work about bio-oil esterification thus employed acid catalysts. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the acid catalysts used in the literature include the solid acidic resin (i.e. Amberlyst 70, Amberlyst 35, Dowex50WX2), mineral acids (i.e. H2SO4, HCl), the supported acid catalysts (i.e. p-toluene sulfonic acid/carbon, silica sulfuric acid) and sulfated metal oxides (i.e. SiO2/TiO2-SO4 2−, SO4 2−/ZrO2-TiO2) and zeolites (i.e. ZSM-5, HZSM-5). Mineral acids have strong acidity and could disperse almost homogeneously in bio-oil. However, separation of the acids from the liquid products is an issue. The high corrosiveness of mineral acids to the reactor wall also creates a safety issue. Solid acid catalyst could be separated from the reactants easily. However, leaching of hydrogen ions or acidic sites (i.e. Amberlyst 70, sulfated metal oxides) at the elevated reaction temperatures contaminates the liquid product. Furthermore, the dispersion of hydrogen ions is another disadvantage. For example, in the solid acidic resin catalysts (i.e. Amberlyst 70), the hydrogen ions mainly locate in the local surface of the catalyst (inside the pores) [73]. As shown in Fig. 7 , the pH decreased sharply only on the very surface of the catalyst [73]. This creates an issue of the access of the big carboxylic acids to the hydrogen ions in the inner pores [50]. Furthermore, in the solvent with the low polarity, the solid acidic resin catalyst swells to only a limited extent (Fig. 8 ), which further increases the difficulty to access the acidic sites inside the pores. In addition, coke formation is another issue for the use of these organic polymeric catalysts. Coke could block the pores of the catalyst and has to be removed to recover the catalytic activity. However, the catalyst cannot be regenerated via combustion of the coke, as the acidic resin is a carbon-based material. How to overcome this problem determines the feasibility of this type of catalyst in bio-oil esterification. In comparison, the coke in zeolites can be removed via combustion, which is an advantage. However, acid density of zeolites is generally lower than that of solid acidic resin catalysts [74–76]. Further to this, the hydrothermal stability of zeolites in the water-rich medium such as bio-oil is another challenge [77–79]. If the acid density of zeolites could be increased and the hydrothermal stability is improved, zeolites may be the promising catalysts for esterification of bio-oil due to the capacity to be regenerated via calcinations in air. In addition, it has to note that although esterification is a method employed to neutralize the carboxylic acids, the pH of the esterified bio-oil does not necessarily have to be higher than that before esterification. This is because the hydrogen ions or the SO3H group can be leached during esterification of bio-oil, especially at higher reaction temperature. The solid catalysts with the SO3H group such as solid acidic resin catalysts [51] and sulfated metal oxides [56] could leach in bio-oil medium and at relatively higher temperature, leading to contamination of the products and the loss of activity of the catalysts. How to manage the leaching problem is a key challenge, which needs to be taken into account when develops solid acid catalysts for bio-oil esterification or other circumstances involving the using of solid acid catalysts."
12,Reactors for bio-oil esterification,"4.2 Reactors for bio-oil esterification Esterification of bio-oil was mostly performed in batch reactors. However, esterification of bio-oil in a continuous-flow reactor is preferred in terms of industrial application. Performing esterification of bio-oil using batch reactor generally could get good mass balance, which is very important for investigation of reaction network during bio-oil esterification. In addition, the residence time can be as long as required and there is generally no blockage of the reactor. However, it is relatively difficult to scale up the batch process. More importantly, the productivity is relatively low as esterification of bio-oil using batch reactor can only be operated in batch mode. This requires frequent installation of the reactor and discharge of the products, leading to high operation cost and low efficiency. Using a fixed-bed and continuous flow reactor could reduce the operation cost and significantly enhance the efficiency for esterification of bio-oil as bio-oil/alcohol mixture can be continuously fed in. However, one disadvantage for a continuously reactor is the blockage of the catalyst bed due to coke formation. Bio-oil is very reactive towards polymerisation and the polymerisation of bio-oil in the catalyst bed could easily create a high pressure-drop and force the operation to terminate. Another disadvantage and difficulty for esterification of bio-oil is how to control the residence time of bio-oil/alcohol in the catalyst bed. The reaction rate for esterification is generally slow at the low reaction temperatures (i.e. <100°C) and longer residence time is required to achieve reasonable conversion of acids. At higher reaction temperatures (i.e. >150°C), acids could be converted quicker and the residence time may be shortened. However, at the high temperatures, many other reactions especially polymerization of bio-oil may occur, which leads to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Thus, the reaction parameters have to be delicately adjusted in a continuous-flow reactor. The in-line esterification performed by Hilten et al. was operated in a continuous-flow mode, but no acid catalyst was used [60]. The method may need to be further modified to incorporate acid catalysts to accelerate the conversion of acetic acid, due to the relatively low conversion of the acids. Reactive distillation also has the potential to be operated in a continuous-flow mode, which, however, is an energy-intensive method."
13,Reaction network of the individual components of bio-oil during esterification,
14,Carboxylic acids,"5.1 Carboxylic acids Carboxylic acids are the origin of the corrosiveness of bio-oil, which can be converted into the neutral esters via esterification. However, in the absence of an external acid catalyst at 90°C, the esterification of the carboxylic acids such as acetic acid hardly took place [47]. External catalyst is thus required to accelerate the esterification reactions. A number of acid catalysts, as summarized in Tables 1 and 2, have been applied in the esterification of bio-oil. Most of them are active for the esterification reactions. However, the conversion of the acids could not proceed to completion without the simultaneous removal of water. For example, during the esterification of the bio-oil from mallee wood, the conversion of acetic acid could not reach 90% under the various conditions investigated [47]. This was due to the presence of the abundant water (20wt.%) in the bio-oil, which shifted the reaction equilibrium to the acid side. Another example is the conversion of acetic acid during the esterification of the bio-oil from mallee bark. The conversion of acetic acid could not reach 80% [48]. The water content in the bio-oil from mallee bark was ca. 45%, which negatively affected the conversion of the carboxylic acids. Furthermore, the solid acidic resin catalyst (Amberlyst 70) in the wet form contains ca. 55wt.% of water, which might add up to the water in the reaction mixture. In addition, the dehydration of the sugars in bio-oil, the polymerization reactions and the etherification reactions all contribute to the formation of the additional water. This further negatively affects the conversion of the acids. This is an intrinsic limitation for the conversion of the acids in the presence of the abundant water in bio-oil. The simultaneous distillation helps to shift the reaction equilibrium to the ester side to achieve higher conversion of the acids, which has been discussed in Section 3.2. However, this method requires the use of high-boiling point alcohols and lead to vaporization of light components that are essential for maintaining the low viscosity of bio-oil. The high flowability of bio-oil is important for the further upgrading via the process such as hydrotreatment. In addition to acetic acid, there were many carboxylic acids with long carbon chain or aromatic ring in the bio-oil from mallee leaves [50]. In theory, the reaction behaviours of these big carboxylic acids should be no difference from that of the small ones. However, Hu and Li et al. found that the reaction behaviours of the carboxylic acids with the different molecular structures were very different over Amberlyst 70. As shown in Fig. 9 , the conversion of the carboxylic acids was decreased with the increase of the carbon chain. The conversion of n-hexadecanoic acid has not started yet during the temperature ramping, while the conversion of acetic acid had reached ca. 70%. Clearly, the longer the carbon chains of the acids, the lower the conversion. The carboxylic acids with the branched carbon chain also behaved differently. It was more difficult to convert 3-methyl-butanoic acid than pentanoic acid, though they have same number of carbon atoms. If the carboxylic acid contains an aromatic ring, the reaction rate would be reduced further (Fig. 10 ), although the aromatic acid such as benzoic acid has a lower pKa than acetic acid (4.20 versus 4.74). Steric hindrance was the main reason for the different reaction behaviours of the carboxylic acids. Amberlyst 70 is a solid acidic resin that swells in polar solvents, making the SO3H group in the inner pores accessible [80]. However, unlike the mineral acids, the hydrogen ions in Amberlyst 70 were dispersed locally [73]. The reactants have to diffuse into the pores of the catalyst to access the hydrogen ions. The molecular structure thus imposes a significant effect on the conversion of the acids over Amberlyst 70. The acids with the short carbon chain have easier access to the catalytic sites than the ones with the long branched carbon chains or aromatic rings. In addition, the acids with a branched carbon chain or an aromatic ring are “fat” and had more difficulty to access the hydrogen ion in the small pores, leading to the lower conversion. The steric hindrance is a problem for the conversion of the carboxylic acids over the solid acid catalyst, but may not be one over the homogeneously dispersed mineral acids like sulfuric acid. This research topic, however, has been rarely touched. Over a solid acid catalyst or a mineral acid, the steric hindrance that the small molecules and the big molecules experienced must be different. The big molecules such as the pyrolytic lignin might not have access the hydrogen ions located in the inner pores of the solid acid catalyst. The reaction behaviors of the heavy components of bio-oil over mineral acid catalyst need to be investigated to understand their reaction kinetics under the condition of esterification. Although the use of the mineral acids such as H2SO4 and HCl as the catalysts can eliminate the steric hindrance, the separation of these homogeneously dispersed acids from the reactants is problematic. The solid acid catalyst does not have the problem of separation, but its limitation in conversion of the high-molecular mass molecules needs to be considered. Wu et al. developed a non-aqueous potentiometric titration method to quantify the total carboxylic acids and the phenolics in the bio-oil from mallee biomass [81]. It was found that, in addition to the light acids identified with GC-MS, the heavy carboxylic acids accounts for 29–45% (mol basis) of the total carboxylic acids in the bio-oil from mallee wood. The reaction behaviors of the heavy carboxylic acids in methanol have not been understood yet. Further study is required to understand their structural configurations and behaviors as the heavy carboxylic acids contribute to the corrosiveness of bio-oil."
15,Aldehydes and ketones,"5.2 Aldehydes and ketones Under the condition of esterification, the acetalization of the aldehydes in bio-oil takes place simultaneously [47]. The presence of an acid catalyst could also promote the conversion of the aldehydes [47]. The acetalization reactions negatively affect the esterification reactions [32], as was discussed in Section 2. Under the conditions of esterification, many reactions other than esterification take place in parallel, which may also affect the esterification in some way. The interactions of these parallel reactions need more investigation. Acetals are the initial product from acetalization. Unlike esters produced from esterification of carboxylic acids, acetals are not stable at the elevated reaction temperatures [47]. With the prolonged reaction time, the acetals such as the dimethoxymethane formed from the acetalization of formaldehyde and the 1,1,2-trimethoxy-ethane formed from the acetalization of hydroxy aldehyde decomposed or reacted with other components in bio-oil via condensation, leading to the decrease in the abundance. The condensation of the acetals may be undesirable as it will decrease the volatility of bio-oil. In addition to the acetals, the ketones could also condense. For example, hydroxyl acetone is a ketone with a significant abundance in bio-oil [82]. Under the condition of esterification, it could not be converted into acetal [48]. However, it could cross-polymerize with the phenolics such as guaiacol to form more reactive products [83]. The carbonyl group is the reaction centre for the polymerization reactions. Since acetalization could not transform the carbonyl group in hydroxyl acetone, hydrogenation will be needed to transform the carbonyl group into hydroxyl group to minimize their involvement in the polymerization. There are a number of heavy aldehydes and ketones in bio-oil, which could not be identified. The conversion routes for these heavy aldehydes and ketones during the esterification are unknown. Lievens et al. developed a new approach to characterize the overall abundance of the carbonyl group in the acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones and lactones with FT-IR [84]. It was found that, after esterification, the abundance of the unsaturated aldehydes and ketones decreased significantly, while the abundance of the hydroxyl unsaturated aldehydes and ketones increased remarkably. This was due to the hydration of the carbon-carbon double bonds in the unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. The above FT-IR method provides a useful method for understanding the change of the carbonyl functionality. However, the detailed reaction pathways for the transformation of the high molecular mass aldehydes and ketones remain unclear."
16,Esters,"5.3 Esters Esters are the main products from the esterification of the carboxylic acids in bio-oil, but there are some esters originally existing in the bio-oil. They could react with methanol via the transesterification reactions [48]. For example, isoamyl isovalerate reacted with methanol via the transesterification, forming isopentyl alcohol and methyl isovalerate (Fig. 11 ). The formation of the small esters or the small alcohols improves the property of bio-oil as a fuel. Via GC-MS only the light esters could be detected. It has not been understood yet if there are other high molecular-mass esters existing in bio-oil. Their reactivities towards transesterification are also unknown. The light esters such as methyl acetate are neutral and can be potentially used as the fuel additive. Isolation of these esters during or after esterification has practical significance. However, one main problem is the separation of the light esters from the alcohols. For example, the boiling point of methyl acetate (56.9°C) is close to that of methanol (64.7°C). Not much effort has been attempted so far to separate the esters from the mixture of alcohols and bio-oil. During the hydrotreatment of the esterified bio-oil, the light esters may be converted into alkanes, which is not a preferable way for the utilization of the esters produced from the esterification. Thus, how to separate the esters after esterification of bio-oil in a cost effective way is a topic that worth further investigation."
17,Terpenoids and eucalyptol in the bio-oils produced from leaves,"5.4 Terpenoids and eucalyptol in the bio-oils produced from leaves Terpenoids and cyclic ethers such as eucalyptol are abundant in the bio-oil produced from certain biomass, e.g. leaves from mallee. They are not the common compounds like acetic acid existing in the bio-oil produced from most of the biomass. However, the concentration of eucalyptol in the bio-oil from mallee leaves can be up to 10wt.%, depending on the pyrolysis conditions [85]. During the esterification, Hu et al. found that eucalyptol together with the terpenoids were also further converted [49]. As shown in Fig. 12 , hydrogen ions could attack the ether bond in eucalyptol, forming the terpenoids. With the aid of the acid catalyst, the terpenoids were further converted into p-cymene with the formation of a-terpineol, terpinolene and α-terpinene as the intermediates. Several steps including ring-opening, dehydration, isomerisation and aromatisation were involved. p-Cymene is an aromatic hydrocarbon, which can be used as a fuel additive. The conversion of eucalyptol into the aromatic hydrocarbon opens an opportunity for utilizing eucalyptol as the feedstock for the production of the fuel additive. Similar to that of eucalyptol, the terpenoids could also be converted into aromatic hydrocarbons via the similar reaction pathways. The polymerization of eucalyptol and the terpenoids over Amberlyst 70 was insignificant. During the above process, the oxygen in eucalyptol and in the terpenoids was removed in the form of water, which is a highly desirable way to remove the oxygen in the organics in bio-oil. The oxygen in other organics such as sugars could also be removed via dehydration reactions. However, the dehydration of sugars is always accompanied by the polymerization reactions [86–89], which impose a challenge for the reduction of oxygen content via the acid-catalyzed routes."
18,Phenolics,"5.5 Phenolics Phenolics, which are derived mainly from the pyrolysis of the lignin in biomass and contains one or more aromatic rings, hydroxyl groups and other functionalities, is one of the most abundant fractions in bio-oil. However, via GC-MS only a few phenolic compounds with single aromatic ring could be identified. Majority of the phenolic compounds, especially the high molecular mass compounds, cannot be identified. Their detailed structural configurations are largely unknown. Due to their complexity, few studies have focused on their conversions during the acid treatment of bio-oil. Hu et al. investigated the conversion of phenol, guaiacol, vanillin and 3,4-dimethoxyacetophenone during the esterification of the bio-oil from mallee bark [48]. It was found that the functionalities of the phenolics significantly affected their stabilities in the acidic environment. Phenol or guaiacol has the hydroxyl groups and their conversions were negligible during esterification. In comparison, the unsaturated functionalities in 4-vinylguaiacol and 3,4-dimethoxyacetophenone made them very reactive. However, the detailed reaction routes for their conversion have not been understood yet. Polymerization might be one possible reaction pathway. Hu et al. further investigated the contribution of the typical phenolic compounds towards polymerization by mixing them with a number of bio-oil derived model compounds [83]. They found that although the acidity of the phenolics like phenol and guaiacol is very weak, they could catalyze the polymerization reactions. Furthermore, the phenolics are directly involved in the polymerization reactions. For example, guaiacol could react with hydroxyl acetone, forming1-(4-hydroxyl-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-propanone. The aromatic ring is a target for the electrophilic reagents. The unsaturated functionality (i.e. carbonyl group) in the phenolics makes them even more reactive towards polymerization. In methanol, phenol and guaiacol were stabilized. However, vanillin was still very reactive. The condensation products from vanillin were too heavy to be detected with GC-MS. Hence, the detailed route for its conversion has not been understood yet. By using the new non-aqueous potentiometric titration method, Wu et al. found that the GC-MS detectable light phenolic compounds only account for 3% (mol basis) of the total phenolic compounds in the bio-oil produced from mallee wood [81]. The structural configurations, the molecular sizes and the functionalities of the rest 97% of phenolics are largely unknown. These, however, are the vital information for understanding their catalytic behaviors during the upgrading of bio-oil via either acid treatment or hydrotreatment. Hu et al. have found that over Amberlyst 70 the steric hindrance played important roles for the conversion of the carboxylic acids with the varied molecular sizes [50]. The steric hindrance might also be a problem for the conversion of other heavy compounds. The heavy components like pyrolytic lignin might not be able to access the acidic sites located in the inner pore of the catalyst during the esterification. Using mineral acid as the catalyst can effectively eliminate the steric hindrance and significantly improve the accessibility of pyrolytic lignin to hydrogen ions. However, analyzing the product from pyrolytic lignin remains a major challenge."
19,Sugars,"5.6 Sugars Levoglucosan is formed during the pyrolysis of the cellulose in biomass. During the esterification of the bio-oil from mallee wood, Gunawan et al. found that some sugar oligomers in the bio-oil could continue to decompose to form levoglucosan, but only at the low reaction temperatures (i.e. 70 or 90°C) [46]. At the elevated reaction temperatures, levoglucosan was mainly converted into methyl levulinate with the formation of glucose, methyl glucopyranosides and HMF as the intermediates [90]. Other sugars such as glucose, dianhydro-d-glucopyranose, 1,6-anhydro-d-talopyranose, 2,3-anhydro-d-mannosan, 3,4-anhydro-d-galactosan and 1,4;3,6-dianhydro-a-d-glucopyranose could also be converted into methyl levulinate, as shown in Fig. 13 [90]. The conversion of these reactive sugars into methyl levulinate is desirable as that improves the stability of bio-oil. The conversion of sugars via acid treatment is always a hot research topic [91–96]. This is because, under the acidic reaction conditions, the dehydration of sugars leads to the formation of the intermediates with carbon-carbon double bonds or conjugated π bonds. Thus, sugars are prone to polymerize. Hu and Li found that levoglucosan experienced distinct reaction pathways in the water-rich medium and in the methanol-rich medium [97], as shown in Fig. 14 . In the water-rich medium, levoglucosan was mainly polymerized while, in methanol-rich medium, the polymerisation was effectively suppressed. Similar phenomenon was observed for the acid-treatment of glucose in methanol and water [98]. It was believed that the conversion of glucose to methyl glucopyranosides and the conversion of HMF to its ethers/acetals protected the reactive functional groups and stabilized the reactive intermediates. As shown in Fig. 15 . As for C5 sugars like xylose, it mainly polymerized during the acid-treatment with the prolonged reaction time [99]. Solvents significantly affect the conversion of levoglucosan or glucose, among the solvents investigated (i.e. water, alcohols, toluene, dimethyl sulfoxide, chloroform, tetrohydrofuran, hydroxyl acetone, N,N-dimethyl formamide, acetone), alcohols are the most effective one for suppressing the polymerization of sugars and furans [73,100]. In comparison, polymerization was always the main reaction pathways for acid-treatment of xylose in all of the above solvents [101,102]. Bio-oil contains different sugars and furans. It was found that these sugars and furans interacted with each other during the acid-treatment, but the interaction was not significant enough to form significantly more insoluble polymer [103–106]. In bio-oil, only the simple sugars like levoglucosan, glucose, xylose and sucrose can be identified with GC-MS and HPLC [107,108]. The information about the structural configuration of the sugar oligomers in bio-oil is scarce. The characterization of the bio-oils produced from Corn Stalk with Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) showed that mass-averaged molecular weight of the bio-oil is ca. 530 [109]. Evidently, many high molecular-mass molecules are present in bio-oil. These heavy components create many problems in the upgrading of bio-oil. For example, the heavy components travelled at a much slower rate than the light components of bio-oil during the hydrotreatment [110]. The holdup of the heavy components in the catalyst was believed to occupy some active sites, making them unavailable for other reactions during the continuous hydrotreatment. These heavy components were believed to be a very important source of coke. The heavy sugar oligomers are believed to be one important fraction of the heavy species in bio-oil. Little is known about reaction behaviours and fates of the heavy sugars under the conditions of esterification. Similarly, it is also difficult to understand their behaviours during the hydrotreatment of bio-oil. In addition, solid acid catalysts were commonly used in esterification of bio-oil. The heavy sugars may have difficulty to access the acidic sites due to the steric hindrance. Such problem may not exist with the use of mineral acids as the hydrogen ions can be homogeneously dispersed and be accessible for the heavy molecules. Effort needs to be made to understand the behaviours of the heavy sugars over the mineral acid catalysts and the solid acid catalysts."
20,Furans,"5.7 Furans Furans are the dehydration products from sugars [111,112]. Some furans like HMF and furfuryl alcohol can also be produced during pyrolysis of biomass, which were further converted into methyl levulinate during the esterification in methanol [113–115]. In methanol-rich medium, the furans with the aldehyde functionality were initially converted into acetals, which is believed to suppress the polymerization of the furans such as HMF. Methanol could also stabilize the reaction intermediates formed from the degradation of the furans [116]. For example, in water furfuryl alcohol was mainly polymerized while in methanol it could be quantitatively converted into methyl levulinate, as shown in Fig. 16 . Furfural, however, is an exception. Polymerization is its dominant reaction pathway either in methanol or in water. The furans in bio-oil generally have low concentrations. During the esterification of bio-oil, furans are produced as the intermediate products, which either are further converted to other compounds or polymerized. How to efficiently extract the furans from bio-oil is a research topic worth further investigation."
21,N-containing organics,"5.8 N-containing organics Nitrogen is an essential element in chlorophyll in leaves. In the bio-oil produced from mallee leaves, N-containing organics were transferred into the bio-oil. During esterification of the bio-oil from mallee leaves, Hu et al. found that, at the low loading of Amberlyst 70 (3wt.%), acetic acid could not be effectively converted via the esterification [51]. In comparison, acetic acid conversion could reach the plateau with the same catalyst loading in esterification of the bio-oil from mallee wood [51]. It was found that the N-containing organics in the leaves bio-oil neutralized the acidic sites of Amberlyst 70, leading to nearly complete deactivation of the catalyst. High catalyst loading thus is required for esterification of the bio-oil produced from leaves, as part of the catalyst needs to be sacrificed to remove the N-containing organics via the acid-base reaction. The N-containing organics on catalyst surface can be removed by washing with a concentrated sulfuric acid to recover activity of the catalyst, as shown in Fig. 17 [51]. However, the regeneration method is costly. Compared with the esterification of the bio-oil from mallee wood and bark, esterification of the bio-oil from mallee leaves is more challenging due to the N-containing organics. The N-containing organics may also exist in the bio-oil produced from other feedstock, especially from the leaves of biomass. Esterification of these types of bio-oil is expected to face the same problem. How to remove the N-containing organics cost-efficiently before esterification remains a challenge."
22,Metal species,"5.9 Metal species Like the nitrogen element in chlorophyll, minerals are essential for biomass. Although majority of the metal species were retained in bio-char during pyrolysis, some are transferred into bio-oil. Hu et al. observed that, under the same conditions, the conversion of acetic acid was always remarkably lower in the esterification of the bio-oil from mallee bark than in esterification of the bio-oil from mallee wood [51]. It was found that, during the esterification, Amberlyst 70 reacted with either the metal oxides or the metal ions via the ion exchange, converting the SO3H group into SO3M group (M stands for metal species). This deactivated the catalyst and led to the low conversion of acetic acid. Both the bio-oil from mallee wood and the bio-oil from mallee bark contain metal species, but the metal species are more abundant in the bark bio-oil, especially the calcium species [82]. Other metal species such as sodium, iron and potassium species were also found on/in the deactivated catalysts. Hu et al. also found that the deactivated catalysts could be regenerated by immersing the catalysts in a concentrated sulfuric acid (40wt.%) to convert the SO3M group back into the SO3H group. The reaction kinetics of the calcium species with Amberlyst 70 were also investigated. It was found that the abundance of the calcium species decreased from ca. 115 to ca. 80μg/per g of bio-oil by stirring Amberlyst 70 with bio-oil at room temperature for 5min. The abundance the calcium species was further reduced to ca. 24μg/per g of bio-oil after 120min of residence time at room temperature. Clearly, the calcium species was quite reactive with the catalyst. However, it has not been understood whether Amberlyst 70 reacted with the calcium oxide or the calcium ion. Metals in bio-oil need to be removed as they react with the acid catalyst, leading to the catalyst deactivation. To remove the metal species in the upstream of biomass pyrolysis is a possibility. Acid digestion could remove the alkali metals but the cost is a limiting factor. Baldwin et al. developed a hot gas filtration method to reduce the content of metal species in bio-oil [117]. The abundance of alkali and alkaline earth metals and solids was greatly reduced, while total mass loss of bio-oil because of the hot gas filtration is about 10–30wt.%."
23,Regeneration of the deactivated solid acid catalyst,"5.10 Regeneration of the deactivated solid acid catalyst Bio-oil is a very complex mixture of organics and inorganics. During the esterification, a number of reactions occur in parallel on/in catalysts, which impose distinct effects on activity of the catalyst. For example, the reactions of the catalyst with either N-containing organics or the metal species lead to the deactivation of the catalyst [51]. In addition, some organics in bio-oil can be strongly absorbed on surface of the catalyst. The characterization of the used Amberlyst 70 showed that the surface of the catalyst became very “dirty”, as shown in Fig. 18 [51]. Many “gum-like” organic species covered the surface of the catalyst. Further to this, the polymer formed from the organics in bio-oil filled the inner pores of the catalysts, making the increased size of the catalyst beads. Hu et al. investigated the regeneration of the catalysts via washing with acetone and a concentrated sulfuric acid [51]. It was found that the washing with acetone could effectively remove the adsorbed organics on catalyst surface (Fig. 18). The catalytic activity could be improved but not significantly. Washing the deactivated catalysts with a concentrated sulfuric acid (40wt.%), which was a process of ion exchange, could remove majority of the metal species and the N-containing organics on surface of the catalyst. The catalytic reactivity could be recovered remarkably. However, the catalysts cannot be completely regenerated, as the polymer formed in the inner pore of the catalyst could not be removed via either washing with acetone or sulfuric acid. The polymer inside the deactivated catalyst was the biggest challenge for regeneration of the catalyst. Possibly only combustion can remove the organic polymer, which, however, cannot be applied here, as Amberlyst 70 is an organic polymeric material. The zeolites catalysts do not have this intrinsic problem but the activity and the hydrothermal stability need to be improved. Another strategy to alleviate the formation of the polymer is to perform the esterification at low reaction temperatures (i.e. 90°C). The carboxylic acids such as acetic acid still can be effectively converted [51]. However, at the low reaction temperatures, it will be difficult to convert the sugars like levoglucosan at a reasonable reaction rate. Furthermore, even under the mild reaction conditions, the deactivation of solid acid catalyst due to the metal species and the N-containing organics is still unavoidable [51]. How to alleviate the deactivation and how to improve the methods for regeneration of the solid acid catalyst is an important research topic that worth further investigation."
24,Contribution of the major components of bio-oil towards polymerization,"5.11 Contribution of the major components of bio-oil towards polymerization Polymerization of bio-oil during esterification deactivates the solid acid catalyst, and makes regeneration of the carbon-based catalyst extremely difficult. In order to develop the method to suppress the polymerization of bio-oil, it is crucial to understand how the main components of bio-oil contribute to the polymerization. Hu et al. made an effort to understand this by heating up a mixture of compounds representing the sugars, sugar derivatives and simple phenolics in bio-oil at various temperatures [83]. It was found that acetic acid and formic acid did not directly react with other compounds such as sugars and phenolics under the reaction conditions employed. However, they are the catalysts for the condensation of the sugars, furans and phenolics via i.e. electrophilic substitution or aldol condensation reactions. Formic acid is more active than acetic acid for catalyzing the polymerization reactions due to its stronger acidity. Without the presence of the carboxylic acids, the sugars, sugar derivatives and phenolics are more stable. Sugars play an important role in the polymerization reactions, as the dehydration of sugars produce the reactive intermediates. These intermediates may cross-polymerize with the sugar derivatives or the phenolics. The furans like furfural, HMF and furfuryl alcohols also are very reactive towards polymerization. The phenolics with the unsaturated functionalities such as vanillin are much more reactive towards polymerization than the ones like phenol without an unsaturated functionality attached on the benzene ring. The model compound experiment could provide some information about the behaviours of the typical compounds of bio-oil during the polymerization. However, bio-oil has hundreds of compounds. The polymerization during the acid-treatment of bio-oil is far more complex than that in the model compound experiment. It has not been even clear about how many compounds or how many types of compounds are involved in the polymerization of bio-oil. Most importantly, it has not been understood about how the heavy components of bio-oil (i.e. heavy sugars and pyrolytic lignin) contribute to the polymerization. It has also not been understood about how the heavy sugars behave differently from the pyrolytic lignin during the polymerization. Further to this, the interaction of these different components has not been understood yet, which makes understanding of the mechanism for the polymerization of bio-oil difficult. A clear picture about the reaction network for the polymerization of bio-oil has not been available yet."
25,Summary and outlooks,"The catalytic processes and the reaction network in acid treatment of bio-oil in alcohols were reviewed in this study. The typical catalytic processes employed for the acid treatment includes the esterification in subcritical alcohols and supercritical alcohols, esterification in olefin/alcohol, esterification coupled with on-line extraction and distillation, esterification coupled with pre-oxidation, esterification coupled with hydrogenation and in-line esterification of bio-oil. These different processes modify the composition/properties of bio-oil in different ways. Many processes for the acid treatment of bio-oil were performed in batch reactors. To minimize the cost and to increase the efficiency, the esterification of bio-oil may be performed in a continuous-flow reactor. In-line esterification integrates the pyrolysis of biomass, which is a promising method for esterification of bio-oil in a continuous mode. However, the conversion of acetic acid is relatively low as no acid catalyst was used. How to incorporate an acid catalyst in the system is deserve further attention. The reaction network involved in the acid treatment of bio-oil in the subcritical alcohols is very complex. The esterification reactions could effectively transform the carboxylic acids in bio-oil into esters, reducing the corrosiveness of bio-oil. The reactive species such as aldehydes were converted into acetals, which contribute to the stabilization of bio-oil. During the acid treatment in alcohols, the C6 sugars in bio-oil such as levoglucosan and glucose were mainly converted into levulinic esters. Alcohols could effectively suppress the polymerization of the C6 sugars or the reactive intermediates. However, alcohols could not help to suppress the polymerization of the C5 sugars in bio-oil (i.e. xylose), which were mainly polymerized. The sugars and furans in bio-oil interact with each other during the acid treatment, but the interaction did not lead to the formation of the significant amount of insoluble polymer. During the polymerization, the furans like HMF and furfural have more contribution towards polymerization than the corresponding sugar precursors. How to suppress the polymerization of the furans requires attention. In addition to the sugars and furans, the phenolics are another important fraction of bio-oil. During the acid-treatment, the phenolics without the unsaturated functional groups such as phenol and guaiacol were relatively stable. However, the phenolics with the unsaturated functional groups were very reactive but their detailed reaction pathways have not been cleared yet. The acid treatment of bio-oil drastically modifies the composition of bio-oil, increases the heating value, reduces the viscosity and improves the stability of bio-oil. However, to continue move this research area further forward, some key problems/questions need to be solved/answered. (1) The heavy components of bio-oil create many problems during upgrading of bio-oil via hydrotreatment. It is important to understand how the acid-treatment in alcohols affects their presences in bio-oil. However, the reaction networks of the heavy components of bio-oil such as heavy sugars and pyrolytic lignin during the esterification of bio-oil have not been fully understood yet. (2) Developing active, hydrothermally stable and, most importantly, regenerable solid acid catalyst remains a challenge. Mineral acids are difficult to be separated from liquid products. The sulfated metal oxides catalyst and solid acidic resin catalyst has the leaching problem, which contaminate the products. More importantly, the polymer formed on/in the solid acidic resin catalysts cannot be regenerated via combustion in air, due to its carbon skeleton. Zeolites can be regenerated via combustion, but the low acid density and the low hydrothermal stability are problematic. (3) How to separate and to recycle the alcohols used in the esterification is another problem of concern. Distillation is energy intensive and the light components of bio-oil including some water could also be distilled. If the alcohols and the esterified bio-oil were hydrotreated together, it has not been understood how the alcohols behaves and affects the hydrotreatment of bio-oil. In addition, the inter molecule etherification of the alcohols during bio-oil esterification consumes the alcohols and produces additional water. How to minimize the etherification while maintain reasonable reaction rate of esterification is a question to be answered. (4) The deleterious properties of raw bio-oil could be significantly improved via esterification. However, the esterified bio-oil still may not be able to be used directly as fuel due to the high oxygen and high water content. The esterification in olefin/alcohols is a good attempt to esterify the acids and simultaneously to reduce the water content. However, how to further process the esterified bio-oil remains an important question to be answered. (5) Polymerization reactions take place during the esterification of bio-oil. This leads to deactivation of catalysts and blockage of reactor (i.e. continuous-flow reactor). To understand how the individual component contributes to the polymerization reactions is an initial but crucial step to optimize the process to minimize the effect of the polymerization reactions on catalysts."
