0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols abbreviated as C2+OH commonly refer to alcohols higher than methanol, which can be used as fuel, fuel additives as octane booster and intermediates for value-added fine chemicals [1–3]. One way for higher alcohols production is the catalytic conversion of synthesis gas (syngas), i.e. the higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) process which has attracted much attention from both industry and academia. Many catalysts have been reported for HAS via syngas and the typical ones include modified methanol catalysts, Rh based catalysts, molybdenum based catalysts, and modified Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) catalysts [2–9]. Modified methanol synthesis catalysts produce mainly methanol and isobutanol, rhodium based catalysts give mainly ethanol and other C2+-oxygenates, while molybdenum based catalysts and modified Fischer–Tropsch (FT) catalysts afford mainly C1–C6 linear primary alcohols. Among them, modified FT catalysts were thought to be one of the most promising catalyst systems with high activity and high C2+OH selectivity [2,3]. Nowadays, both CuCo-based and CuFe-based modified F-T catalysts were intensively studied [10–17]. However, such catalysts often suffer from low stability. Deactivation of the catalysts would lead to lower conversion and decreased total alcohol and/or C2+OH selectivity. For instance, Kiennemann et al. found total alcohol selectivity decreased with time on stream on Fe–Cu–Mo–U catalyst [18]. Chaumette et al. observed the sharp decrease of C2+OH selectivity on Cu–Co based catalysts on various types of reactors [19]. Courty et al. [20] and Xu et al. [21,22] also observed the decrease of both total alcohol selectivity and C2+OH selectivity over Cu–Co based catalysts. Many factors were proposed to account for the observed deactivation. According to the study of Courty et al. [2,20], coke deposition, separation of Co from originally homogeneously distributed Cu–Co phase, and leach of active species probably via cobalt carbonyl caused the deactivation of Cu–Co based catalyst. Xu et al. [21,22] proposed that sintering, carbon/coke/heave wax fouling, separation of ZnO from original Zn–Al–O support, leaching of alkaline metal (Na or K), and the separation of Cu–Co to Cu and Co2C were the main causes of deactivation. However, among these factors which one dominates the decrease of alcohol selectivity seems not clear. In our study, CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles prepared by wet-chemical method was chosen as model catalyst for higher alcohol synthesis. To clarify the reason leading to decrease of alcohol selectivity, the deactivation process and the structural evolution of CuFe nanoparticles during HAS reaction process were investigated. The correlation between the change of catalytic performance and the structural evolution was also discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles were prepared by simultaneous reduction of cupric and ferric nitrates with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in an ethylene glycol (EG) solution under Ar atmosphere. All reagents (A.R.) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. and used directly. Typically, 5mmol of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 15mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were placed in a three-necked flask equipped with a condenser and magnetic stirrer. After Ar flush for about 10min, 170mL of EG was added to dissolve the substrates, and the flask was immersed into an ice-water bath. After the mixed solution was cooled down, 10g of NaBH4 dissolved in 30mL of deaerated and deionized (DI) water was dropped quickly into the solution through a pressure-equilibrium funnel. The solution turned black immediately with evolution of gases. The resulted colloidal solution was stirred for an additional 30min to ensure complete reduction, and further diluted by adding 100mL of deareated DI water. The nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation (12,000rpm, 15min) and washed with deareated DI water (100mL) twice and ethanol (100mL) twice under ambient conditions. The obtained black solid was dried at 150°C for 2h in a tube furnace in N2 flow (100mL/min), and was passivated by 1v% O2/Ar (50mL/min) for 12h to avoid pyrophoric accident."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer, using Cu K α radiation with scanning angle (2θ) ranging from 10° to 80°. The identification of different phases was performed by comparing the patterns with JCPDS standard cards. 2.2.2 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution TEM (HRTEM), and scanning transmission electron microscopy mapping mode energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) TEM and HRTEM measurements were performed on a JEOL JEM 2100F field emission electron microscope with 200kV accelerating voltage. Samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing the nanoparticles in ethanol followed by ultrasonication. One droplet of dispersion was placed on carbon-coated nickel grids for measurement. STEM-EDS images were taken in order to obtain information on the spatial distribution of Cu and Fe across the sample. 2.2.3 Mössbauer spectroscopy (MES) MES was measured at room temperature in transmission geometry using a constant acceleration Mössbauer spectrometer, using a 25mCi 57Co source diffused into Rh matrix. The velocity scale was calibrated with 25μm thick α-Fe foil at room temperature. The spectra were fitted using MossWinn 4.0. The isomer shift values are given with respect to α-Fe at 20°C. 2.2.4 Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP) ICP measurements were performed with a Varian 710-ES Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer to determine the residue boron content in the sample."
4,Catalytic performance,"2.3 Catalytic performance CO hydrogenation tests were performed in a stainless steel continuous flow fixed-bed reactor. 1g of powdered catalyst was used and the catalyst was diluted with 4g of 40–60mesh inert quartz sand to avoid hot spot. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was activated by syngas (H2/CO/N2 =65/32/3) at atmospheric pressure with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 3600h−1. The activation procedure was as follows: room temperature→120°C in 50min and maintained at 120°C for 1h; 120°C→180°C in 60min and kept at 180°C for 30min; 180°C→240°C in 60min and kept at 240°C for 120min; 240°C→300°C in 60min and kept at 300°C for 480min. After the reactor was cooled to below 60°C, the system was pressurized to 6.0MPa in syngas (H2/CO/N2 =65/32/3). 3v% of nitrogen was contained in feed gas as internal standard. The temperature was increased to the reaction temperature with a ramp of 1°C/min. The gas flow was controlled by a calibrated Brooks mass flow controller, and the reaction was conducted at GHSV of 6000h−1. The tail gas, after passing through a hot trap (120°C external) and a cold trap (ice-water bath), was analyzed on-line by GC. H2 and CO were analyzed through a TDX-1 carbon molecular sieves column with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using Ar as the carrier gas. N2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were analyzed as for H2 and CO except that He was used as carrier gas. C1–C10 hydrocarbons were analyzed through a modified alumina packed column with Ar carrier and hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID). The aqueous products, liquid oil products and solid wax products, collected from cold trap and hot trap, were analyzed off-line by GC. The aqueous products were analyzed through two Porapak Q column equipped with a TCD and FID, for H2O and MeOH and C1–C5 oxygenates analyses, respectively. The liquid oil products were analyzed through a HP-1 column with N2 carrier and FID. The solid wax products were dissolved in CS2 and analyzed through a MXT-1 column with N2 carrier and FID. After emptying the hot trap and cold trap, the data were collected every 24h by sampling."
5,Results and discussion,
6,CO hydrogenation,"3.1 CO hydrogenation The catalytic performances of CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles in CO hydrogenation at 220°C with time on stream (TOS) were listed in Tables 1 and 2 . After an initial decrease from 17.1% at 24h to 14.9% at 48h, CO conversion changed little from then on (Table 1). However, the alcohol selectivity decreased gradually with TOS, from 21.9C% at 24h to 13.2C% at 288h. Meanwhile, CO2 selectivity exhibited a similar decreasing trend while hydrocarbon selectivity increased with TOS (Table 1). Notably, both alcohols and hydrocarbons shifted to higher ones with TOS (Table 2). For instance, MeOH decreased from 9.5wt% at 24h to 5.5wt% at 288h within alcohols, while high molecular alcohols (C6+OH) increased from 55.8wt% to 81.9wt%. Methane decreased from 4.1wt% at 24h to 1.2wt% at 288h within hydrocarbons, while C5+ increased from 71.8wt% to 91.9wt%. The products carbon distributions further clearly show that both products shifted from lower carbon ones to higher carbon ones (Fig. 1 ). In addition, both alcohols and hydrocarbons especially the latter deviated from Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distribution. However, the deviation occurred at relatively lower products range. At higher products range, i.e. from C10 for alcohols and C16 for hydrocarbons, both products approximately obeyed ASF distribution (Fig. 1). This makes direct comparison of chain growth probabilities of alcohols and hydrocarbons with TOS possible in a compensate way. The estimated growth factors of alcohols and hydrocarbons were similar with each other as presented in Fig. 2 . In addition, growth factors of both alcohols and hydrocarbons increased with TOS. This means the chain growth ability of the catalyst increased with TOS. Similar values and change trends of chain growth factors of alcohols and hydrocarbons suggested alcohols and hydrocarbons derived from common intermediates. The CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles gave high olefin to paraffin ratios (O/P, Fig. 3 ) as observed on Fe-based F–T catalysts [23,24]. Due to chain length dependent secondary reactions of olefins, O/P decreases exponentially with carbon number [25,26]. Generally, ethene to ethane ratio (C2 =/C2) is always much lower due to high activity of ethene [26]. However, C2 =/C2 was the highest one on this CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 3. In addition, C2 =/C2 and O/P from C10 increased with TOS. Since the CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles were prepared by NaBH4 reduction, residue boron might exist in the catalyst [27]. The residue boron was determined by ICP and a content of B/(Cu+Fe)=7.62atom% was found. The influence of residue boron was also investigated. It was found that except lowering CO conversion the residue boron had no striking effects on products selectivity and distribution."
7,Structural evolution analysis,"3.2 Structural evolution analysis As discussed above, the catalytic performances in HAS of CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles changed with TOS. It was speculated that some structural changes occurred during the reaction. In order to confirm this speculation, the spent sample (after octane extraction under Ar-atmosphere) was subjected to XRD, HRTEM and STEM-EDS analysis. XRD patterns indicate that metallic Cu (JCPDS # 04-0836), Cu2O (JCPDS # 05-0667) and CuFe2O4 spinel phase (JCPDS # 25-0283) exist in fresh sample (Fig. 4a). The existence of copper or iron oxides might be due to air-induced re-oxidation of metallic Cu and Fe during post treatment process [10,28], since the process of sample separation and washing were conducted at ambient condition and Cu and Fe are prone to be air-oxidized. Only metallic Cu and magnetite (JCPDS # 19-0629) exist in bulk phase of the activated sample (Fig. 4b). The spent sample showed similar XRD pattern as activated one, but peaks related to SiO2 and two peaks at 2θ =21.5° and 23.9° were also present. The existence of SiO2 was due to the trace residue quartz sand used for catalyst dilution. The two peaks corresponding to lattice spaces of 0.41nm (21.5°) and 0.37nm (23.9°) deviate from all possible phases of metallic and oxidized Cu or/and Fe, their phase assignment was unknown till now. Similar strange lattice spaces at 0.394nm, 0.398nm and 0.412nm were also observed by Janbroers et al. on spent Fe-based FT catalysts through quasi in situ TEM [29]. So these peaks were likely from iron-containing materials, but the phase assignment needs more characterization. TEM results of fresh (Fig. 5a), activated (Fig. 5b) and spent (Fig. 5c) samples showed that the fresh sample were spherical in nature, the activated sample also contains mainly spherical nanoparticles with slightly smaller diameter than the fresh one, while the spent sample contains nanorods besides spherical nanoparticles. Severe sintering was found in the spent sample with the size of some particles being even larger than 100nm due to the lack of stabilizing agent and support. The formation of nanorods must be due to the reaction condition since the fresh and activated samples were composed of only nanoparticles. STEM-EDS results show that the distribution of Cu and Fe components was homogeneous across the particles in fresh and activated sample (Fig. 5a1–a2 and b1–b2), while the spatial distribution of the two elements for the spent sample turned to be inhomogeneous (Fig. 5c1–c2). In order to further reveal the detailed structure, HRTEM was measured for the spent sample. Fig. 6 showed the typical HRTEM images of the spent sample, with a and b representative for nanoparticles and c for nanorods. The bottom right corner at each image was the corresponding TEM image, and the top right corner at each image was FFT pattern (in a and b) or ED pattern (in c). In Fig. 6a, only the lattice space of 0.21nm corresponding to Cu (111) was detected, indicating this was a monometallic Cu particle. In Fig. 6b, only the lattice space of 0.25nm corresponding to Fe3O4 (311) lattice was observed, indicating it was a Fe3O4 nanoparticle. In Fig. 6c for the nanorod, lattice distance of 0.25nm corresponding to Fe3O4 (311) lattice was observed, suggesting the nanorod be Fe3O4. All these identifications were confirmed by FFT patterns or ED result. Based on the above characterization results, it is clear that Cu and Fe species were separated during the reaction. The catalyst evolved from CuFe nanoparticles with homogeneous Cu and Fe distribution in the fresh and activated samples to larger nanoparticles and nanorods with various chemical identities for the spent sample. The identified types of nanoparticles in the spent sample include monometallic Cu and Fe3O4, while the nanorods were only of Fe3O4. One-dimensional magnetite nanostructures were widely reported [30], the magnetite nanorods in spent sample might be formed through coalescence of magnetite nanoparticles under hydrothermal reaction condition [31] along its easy-magnetization [110] axis direction [32]. On iron based F-T catalysts, iron carbides (FeC x ) are generally thought to be the active sites involving in chain initiation and propagation [33,34]. However, no iron carbides species was detected by XRD and TEM. To confirm whether the iron carbides exist or not, Mössbauer spectroscopy (MES) measurement was conducted for spent sample. The result was presented in Fig. 7 , and the deduced parameters were listed in Table 3 . Two doublets and one sextuplet were observed. One doublet with isomer shift (IS) 0.99mm/s and quadrupole splitting (QS) 1.91mm/s corresponds to super-paramagnetic ferrous ions, and the other doublet with IS 0.39mm/s and QS 1.00mm/s corresponds to super-paramagnetic ferric ions. The sextuplet with IS 0.37mm/s, QS 0.07mm/s and magnetic field (Hhf) 216kOe corresponds to Hägg carbide (χ-Fe5C2) phase [35]. The MES showed that 25.4% of iron existed in the state of χ-Fe5C2 in spent sample, but XRD and TEM did not detected such phase. The χ-Fe5C2 seems likely exist in the form of amorphous layer or of very small crystallites on magnetite containing nanoparticles and nanorods as reported before [33,36–38], making it hard to be detected by XRD and TEM. It is widely accepted that higher alcohol formation needs two active sites on one center, or the so-called dual site, on which one active site functions for CO dissociation and chain propagation while the other one functions for CO non-dissociative activation and insertion. The insertion of molecularly activated CO into alkyl carbon-metal bond gives rise to surface acyl species which is thought to be key intermediate for alcohol production. Further hydrogenation of the surface acyl species leads to the formation of alcohols. Obviously, the synergism between these two sites will benefit the formation of higher alcohols [2–4,8]. On modified F–T catalysts, Cu–M (M=F–T elements) site was thought to be the dual site for higher alcohol synthesis [2], on which Cu acts as CO molecularly activation and insertion site while M is the site for CO dissociative activation and chain propagation. For Cu–Co based catalysts, Cu–Co surface alloy is considered to be the dual site [14], while for Cu–Fe based catalysts, Cu–FeC x might be the dual site [39] since FeC x is the true active site for chain initiation and propagation [18]. In our stability study of CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles for higher alcohol synthesis, the results showed that CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles afforded much higher total alcohol selectivity at early stage of reaction than at later stage. Since alcohols form on dual site, we speculated the decrease of alcohol selectivity with TOS should result from catalyst structural change which affected the dual site. Characterization results show two distinct structural changes occurred during reaction, i.e. sintering and phase separation of Cu and Fe species. Sintering was found to be one of the reasons causing the deactivation of Cu-based methanol catalyst [40] and Fe-based [41] and Co-based [42] F–T catalysts, which leads to declining CO conversion. In this study, the CO conversion also decreased with TOS in the initial stage (Table 1). The initial decrease of CO conversion is a common phenomenon in F–T synthesis. One of the reasons is diffusion restriction of reactants resulting from accumulation of heavy wax in catalyst pores [43]. Sintering might be another reason for the decrease of catalyst activity in the initial stage. On the other hand, Chu et al. found that Co–Cu/La2Zr2O7 catalyst showed much higher C2+ alcohols selectivity than Cu/La2Zr2O7 and Co/La2Zr2O7 catalysts due the Cu–Co synergism [44]. It was also found that CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles showed much higher total alcohol selectivity than Fe monometallic nanoparticles and physical mixture of Cu and Fe monometallic nanoparticles in our group [39]. Both of these results suggest the co-existence of Cu and M species in sole particle is important for Cu-M dual site generation. And it can be expected that phase separation would decrease the alcohol selectivity by destroying the dual site and thus hindering the synergism between Cu and M species. As a result, phase separation is suggested to be the main reason for the decrease of higher alcohol selectivity as depicted in Scheme 1 . Cu sintering, to some extent, could also decrease the synergism between Cu and FeC x by reducing the concentration of Cu–FeC x interface and decrease alcohol selectivity. At the early stage of reaction, Cu and Fe components were intimate in sole particle, as indicated by STEM-EDS. The surface alkyl species formed on FeC x could migrate to neighboring Cu site, which benefited the CO insertion into alkyl groups to form surface acyl species and led to high total alcohol selectivity. During the reaction, these two components were gradually disintegrated. Phase separation destroyed the Cu–FeC x dual site and deprived the synergistic effect between Cu and FeC x . After 288h of TOS, the CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles shifted to resemble a Fe-based F–T catalyst with low alcohol selectivity and high hydrocarbon selectivity (Table 1). It is worthy to mention that the model catalyst used here was unsupported bimetallic nanoparticles. Without the stabilizing effect of support and other promoting agents, structural change would become more severe. Addition of support and promoting agents may retard the sintering and phase separation, and thus increase the stability of the catalyst. In addition, the C6+OH selectivity was very high in alcohol distribution due to the high chain propagation ability of the catalyst. It have been found that the chain growth ability of Fe-based catalysts increase with the FeC x crystallite size within 11nm [45,46]. Decreasing the crystallite size by tuning the catalyst would lower the propagation ability. So it is possible to improve the selectivity of C2–C5 mixed alcohols by controlling the crystallite size. It has been reported that the catalyst prepared by glow discharge plasma-assisted method can afford much smaller particle size and higher C2–C4 alcohols selectivity [16,47]. In the present work, the unsupported CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles were chosen as the model catalyst for structural evolution study due to its relatively simplicity avoiding complex metal-support interactions. Further work about the effect of catalyst support, various promoting agents along with the crystallite size on catalytic performances is needed and being carried out in our group."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, the deactivation process and the structural evolution of CuFe nanoparticles during HAS reaction process were investigated. Alcohol selectivity decreased with time on stream on CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles in HAS. During the reaction, Cu and Fe components gradually phase-separated from homogeneously distribution to monometallic Cu nanoparticles, Fe3O4 nanoparticles, Fe3O4 nanorods and χ-Fe5C2 in the form of amorphous layer or of very small crystallites on Fe3O4 containing nanoparticles and nanorods. Such phase separation, which isolated Cu from Fe species and weakened the synergism between Cu and Fe species, was the main cause to decrease of alcohol selectivity with time on stream. This result suggests that the key to stabilize CuFe bimetallic catalysts appears to prevent the phase separation during reaction."
