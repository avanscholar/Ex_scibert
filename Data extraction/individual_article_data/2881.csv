0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has attracted much attention as a clean and renewable energy source. Many environmental regulations have brought about technological advances in hydrogen utilization such as fuel cell [1]. Steam reforming [2–6], partial oxidation [7–9], auto-thermal reforming [10–12], and CO2 reforming [13,14] have been widely investigated as primary processes for converting hydrocarbons or alcohols into hydrogen. Among these reforming technologies, auto-thermal reforming, which consists of endothermic steam reforming and exothermic partial oxidation, has been recognized as a feasible process for hydrogen production with regard to both hydrogen yield and heat management. Among various fuel sources for hydrogen production, light alcohols such as methanol and ethanol have attracted much attention, because they can be easily handled and are widely distributed around the world [15,16]. In particular, ethanol has been utilized as a promising hydrogen source because of its low toxicity, high volumetric energy density, and availability [17]. Although noble metals are highly active in the auto-thermal reforming reactions, nickel-based catalysts have also been widely used in the reforming processes due to their high intrinsic activity and low cost [18,19]. However, nickel-based catalysts require a high reaction temperature and an excess amount of steam to prevent the carbon deposition and nickel sintering [20–22]. Such severe reaction conditions are not favorable for on-board hydrogen production. Therefore, developing an efficient nickel-based catalyst with high activity and long durability is required for hydrogen production by low-temperature auto-thermal reforming reactions. The identity of support strongly affects the catalytic performance of supported nickel catalysts in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. In a previous work [23], it was reported that nickel catalyst supported on ZrO2 showed a better catalytic performance than that supported on ZnO, MgO, TiO2, and Al2O3 in hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. This is because electronic structure of nickel species supported on ZrO2 was favorably modified for the reaction. However, main drawback in the application of ZrO2 as a supporting material is its low surface area and weak mechanical stability. According to the literatures [24–26], chemical and physical properties of ZrO2 can be improved by the addition of lanthanide and alkaline-earth metal cations such as Y3+, La3+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ into ZrO2 lattice. These dopants stabilize the cubic or tetragonal phase of ZrO2 at room temperature by forming a solid solution. In addition, the replacement Zr4+ with less positive cation causes the oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 to maintain the neutral charge. These oxygen vacancies enhance the oxygen mobility and oxygen ionic conductivity [27,28]. In this work, mesoporous yttria-stabilized zirconia supports with different Y/Zr molar ratio were prepared by a templating sol–gel method, with an attempt to modify the zirconia supports. Nickel catalysts supported on mesoporous yttria-stabilized zirconia were then prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method for use in hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. The effect of Y/Zr molar ratio on the catalytic performance of supported nickel catalysts was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ni catalyst supported on mesoporous yttria-stabilized zirconia,"2.1 Preparation of Ni catalyst supported on mesoporous yttria-stabilized zirconia A series of mesoporous yttria-stabilized zirconia were prepared by a templating sol–gel method with a variation of Y/Zr molar ratio for use as a supporting material for Ni catalyst. A solution comprising 12g of CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, Samchun Chem.), 100ml of distilled water, and known amount of yttrium nitrate (Y(NO3)3, Sigma–Aldrich.) was prepared at 80°C with constant stirring (Solution A). The pH of Solution A was maintained at 10.0 using an ammonium solution (35%, Samchun Chem.). Another solution composed of 12ml of zirconium butoxide (Zr(OBu)4, Sigma–Aldrich) and 30ml of diethylene glycol (C4H10O3, Sigma–Aldrich) was prepared at room temperature with constant stirring (Solution B). After adding Solution B to Solution A, the resulting solution was stirred for 3h to obtain a transparent sol (to form a mesoporous structure). The resulting sol was maintained at 100°C for 24h in a closed container to form a gel. The obtained gel was washed with ethanol and recovered by filtration. The resulting product was then dried at 80°C in a convection oven to obtain a solid. The solid product was finally calcined at 500°C for 5h to yield a mesoporous yttria-stabilized zirconia. The mesoporous yttria-stabilized zirconia with different Y/Zr molar ratio (X) was denoted as YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). Ni catalysts supported on YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. The supported Ni catalysts were dried at 100°C for 12h, and subsequently, they were calcined at 500°C for 5h. The prepared catalysts were denoted as Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). Ni loadings were fixed at 20wt% in all cases."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Chemical compositions of YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports were determined by ICP-AES (Shimadz, ICP-1000IV) analyses. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the supports were obtained with an ASAP-2010 (Micromeritics) instrument. Pore size distributions of the supports were determined by the Barret–Joyner–Hallender (BJH) method applied to the desorption branch of the nitrogen isotherm. Crystalline phases of the supports and supported catalysts were investigated by XRD (MAC Science, M18XHF-SRA) measurements using Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.54056Å) operated at 50kV and 100mA. Surface morphologies of the supports were examined by SEM analyses (Jeol, JSM-840A). In order to determine the reducibility of the catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional flow system with a moisture trap connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of H2 (2ml/min) and N2 (20ml/min) was used for 0.2g of catalyst sample."
4,Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol,"2.3 Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. Each catalyst (50mg) calcined at 500°C was charged into a tubular quartz reactor, and then it was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (10ml/min) and N2 (30ml/min) at 500°C for 3h. Ethanol and water were sufficiently vaporized by passing through a pre-heating zone and continuously fed into the reactor together with N2 carrier (30ml/min). Feed ratios of H2O/EtOH and O2/EtOH were fixed at 3.0 and 0.5, respectively. Contact time was maintained at 175g-catalyst·min/EtOH-mol. Catalytic reaction was carried out at 500°C. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Younglin, ACME 6000) equipped with a TCD. Ethanol conversion and product selectivity were calculated according to the following equations. Here, n represents the number of moles and χ is a stoichiometric factor (χ =2 for C 1 and χ =1 for C 2 compounds). (1) EtOH conversion = n EtoH , in − n EtoH , out n EtoH , in × 100 (2) H 2 selectivity = n H 2 3 ( n EtoH , in − n EtoH , out ) + ( n H 2 O , in − n H 2 O , out ) × 100 (3) C χ selectivity = n C χ χ ( n EtoH , in − n EtoH , out ) × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties of YSZ-X supports,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of YSZ-X supports Physicochemical properties of YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports determined by ICP-AES and BET analyses are summarized in Table 1 . Measured Y/Zr molar ratios of YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports were in good agreement with theoretical values, indicating the successful formation of mesoporous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ-X). Surface area and pore volume of YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports were gradually increased with increasing Y/Zr molar ratio. This result was well consistent with the previous works [29,30] reporting that the addition of yttrium into zirconia led to an increase in surface area of zirconia due to the enhancement of structural stability of tetragonal phase of zirconia. Fig. 1(a) shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports. All the YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports showed IV-type isotherms with H2-type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopores. Mesoporous zirconia (YSZ-0, ZrO2) support exhibited the underdeveloped isotherm and broad H2-type hysteresis loop compared to the other YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports, suggesting that pore size and pore shape were not well defined in the YSZ-0. It should be noted that hysteresis loop of YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports shifted to higher relative pressure with increasing Y/Zr molar ratio. Such a result was similarly observed in the ZrO2–CeO2 system, where the addition of small amount of Ce promoted the textural stability of mesoporous zirconia, leading to high surface area and large pore volume [31,32]. Fig. 1(b) shows the pore size distributions of YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports. YSZ-0 (ZrO2) exhibited the underdeveloped pore size distribution than YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). In the YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports, on the other hand, pore size distribution was gradually broadened and average pore size increased with increasing Y/Zr molar ratio."
7,Crystal structures of supports and supported Ni catalysts,"3.2 Crystal structures of supports and supported Ni catalysts Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports calcined at 500°C. Each crystalline phase was identified using JCPDS. Mesoporous ZrO2 (YSZ-0) support showed the characteristic XRD peaks at 2θ =30.2°, 35.2°, 50.6°, and 60.2°, indicating the formation of tetragonal ZrO2 (JCPDS 00-050-1089). Although a shoulder corresponding to monoclinic ZrO2 appeared at around 2θ =28.5° in the YSZ-0 support, no characteristic XRD peaks corresponding to Y2O3 and monoclinic ZrO2 were observed in the YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports. This can be understood by the previous works [30,33] reporting that the transformation of tetragonal phase of zirconia to monoclinic phase decreased in the presence of Y2O3 in the metastable zirconia system. In the YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports, a close examination of XRD peaks revealed that (111) diffraction peak of tetragonal ZrO2 shifted to lower diffraction angle with increasing Y/Zr molar ratio. This is due to the lattice expansion of Zr4+ caused by the incorporation of Y3+ (radii of Zr4+ and Y3+ are 0.84Å and 0.93Å, respectively). This implies the possible formation of solid solution in the YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports. Average crystalline sizes of YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports calculated from (111) reflection peak using the Scherrer's equation were 8.2nm, 7.3nm, 6.4nm, and 6.2nm, respectively. For zirconia having crystalline size smaller than 30nm, it is known that metastable tetragonal phase exists at low temperatures as a result of crystalline size effect [34]. As described above, crystalline size of YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports gradually decreased with increasing Y/Zr molar ratio. This result indicates that incorporation of Y3+ into zirconia lattice retards crystal growth of zirconia, suppressing the formation of zirconia nuclei during crystallization [35]. The effect Y2O3 addition on the crystalline size of zirconia in the YSZ supports was further confirmed by SEM analyses. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of YSZ-0 (ZrO2) and YSZ-0.1 supports calcined at 500°C. The images clearly showed that crystalline size of YSZ-0 was larger than that of YSZ-0.1. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts calcined and reduced at 500°C. All the calcined catalysts showed the XRD peaks for NiO, indicating that nickel species were well supported on the YSZ (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports (Fig. 4(a)). All the reduced catalysts showed the XRD peaks corresponding to metallic Ni, indicating that nickel oxide was successfully reduced to metallic nickel (Fig. 4(b)). Crystalline size of metallic Ni calculated by the Scherrer's equation decreased with increasing Y/Zr molar ratio in the order of Ni/YSZ-0 (22nm)>Ni/YSZ-0.1 (18nm)>Ni/YSZ-0.2 (15nm)>Ni/YSZ-0.3 (12nm). This implies that crystalline size of metallic Ni in the Ni/YSZ-X catalysts was influenced by the surface area and pore volume of YSZ-X supports (Table 1). High surface area and large pore volume of YSZ-X supports led to the small size of metallic Ni in the reduced Ni/YSZ-X catalysts."
8,Reducibility,"3.3 Reducibility TPR measurements were carried out to investigate the reducibility of Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts and to see the interaction between nickel and support. Fig. 5 shows the TPR profiles of Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts. All the TPR peaks were attributed to the reduction of NiO, because no noticeable reduction peaks of YSZ-X supports were observed in the TPR measurements for bare YSZ-X supports. Ni/YSZ-0 catalyst showed a broad reduction band with a shoulder at 424°C. Upon addition of yttria to zirconia, however, reduction peak of Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) appeared at low temperature compared to that of Ni/YSZ-0. This behavior can be explained by the influence of surface oxygen vacancies on the YSZ support. It is known that the introduction of less positive cations such as Y3+, La3+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ into ZrO2 lattice leads to the formation of defected zirconia having an overall negative charge. This results in an increase of oxygen vacancies for the maintenance of neutral charge [36]. In our catalyst system, therefore, it is believed that the addition of yttira into mesoporous zirconia formed oxygen vacancies, leading to a facile reduction of NiO supported on YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) compared to that supported on YSZ-0. In the Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts, on the other hand, it was observed that reduction peak shifted to higher temperature with increasing Y/Zr molar ratio. It is believed that the higher reduction peak temperature of Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalyst was attributed to the smaller metallic Ni size of the reduced catalysts (Fig. 4), which represents the stronger interaction between nickel and support. Among the catalysts tested, Ni/YSZ-0.1 showed the highest reducibility (the lowest reduction peak temperature)."
9,Catalytic performance of Ni/YSZ-X catalysts,"3.4 Catalytic performance of Ni/YSZ-X catalysts Fig. 6 shows the hydrogen selectivity with time on stream in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol over Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts at 500°C. In the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol performed at 500°C, all the Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts exhibited complete conversion of ethanol. Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts exhibited a higher catalytic performance than Ni/YSZ-0. Ni/YSZ-0 catalysts showed a significant catalyst deactivation after a 25-h reaction. The catalytic performance was decreased in the order of Ni/YSZ-0.1>Ni/YSZ-0.2>Ni/YSZ-0.3>Ni/YSZ-0. The enhanced catalytic performance of Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts compared to Ni/YSZ-0 (Ni/ZrO2) was attributed to the formation of surface oxygen vacancies in the YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports, leading to the facile reduction of NiO. Judging from the fact that BET surface area of YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports increased (Table 1) and XRD peaks of YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) supports shifted to lower diffraction angle (Fig. 2) with increasing Y/Zr molar ratio (X), it can be inferred that the increase of yttria content promoted the formation of ZrO2–Y2O3 solid solution, and consequently, increased the interaction between nickel species and YSZ support. Fig. 7(a) shows the hydrogen selectivity over Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts with respect to Y/Zr molar ratio after a 40-h reaction. It should be noted that the hydrogen selectivity over Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to Y/Zr molar ratio. Among the catalysts tested, Ni/YSZ-X-0.1 showed the best catalytic performance. To elucidate the role and effect of yttria addition into mesoporous zirconia support on the catalytic performance of Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts, selectivities for by-products (CO, CO2, CH4) after a 40-h reaction were examined with respect to Y/Zr molar ratio as shown in Fig. 7(b). Selectivities for CO2 and CH4 over Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) were higher than those over Ni/YSZ-0 (Ni/ZrO2), and selectivity for CH4 showed the maximum value at Y/Zr molar ratio of 0.1. On the other hand, selectivity for CO over Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) was slightly decreased with increasing Y/Zr molar ratio. This result suggests that Ni/YSZ-0.1 catalyst was more favorable for both ethanol decomposition reaction (C2H5OH→CH4 +CO+H2) and WGS reaction (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2) than Ni/YSZ-0 catalyst. With increasing Y/Zr molar ratio, however, oxidation of methane (CH4 +2O2 →CO2 +2H2O), oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO+1/2O2 →CO2), and oxidation of hydrogen (H2 +1/2O2 →H2O) occurred, resulting in an increase of selectivity for CO2 and a decrease of selectivities for CH4, CO, and H2. It is likely that these oxidation reactions preferably occurred because excess oxygen vacancies caused by the introduction of yttria enhanced the oxygen ionic conductivity (oxygen mobility) on the catalyst surface [37]. C2 compounds were not formed over Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts. In the Ni/YSZ-0 catalyst, however, selectivities for ethylene (C2H4) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) were found to be 2.7% and 3.5%, respectively. Judging from the rapid decrease of catalytic activity over Ni/YSZ-0 (Fig. 6) catalyst, it can be inferred that C–C bond cleavage ability of Ni/YSZ-0 catalyst decreased. It was reported that yttria in the Ni/YSZ enhanced the catalytic activity in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol due to its high oxygen vacancies [25]. As mentioned earlier, reducibility of supported Ni catalysts increased due to the enhanced surface oxygen vacancies, improving the catalytic performance in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. It was also reported that surface oxygen vacancies would improve the rate of removal of coke, since the surface oxygen vacancies could induce oxygen radicals from CO2 to react more actively with the carbon deposited on the metallic nickel [30]. Although reducibility of the catalyst is not the sole factor determining the catalytic performance in the auto-thermal reforming reaction, it can serve as a correlating parameter for the catalytic performance in the auto-thermal reforming reaction of ethanol. Fig. 8 shows the correlation between reducibility (reduction peak temperature) and hydrogen selectivity of Ni/YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. The reduction peak temperature determined by TPR measurements (Fig. 5) increased in the order of Ni/YSZ-0.1 (369°C)<Ni/YSZ-0.2 (379°C)<Ni/YSZ-0.3 (386°C)<Ni/YSZ-0 (424°C). The lower reduction peak temperature corresponds to the higher reducibility of the catalyst. Hydrogen selectivity increased with increasing reducibility of the catalyst; more reducible catalyst showed a better catalytic performance in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol."
10,Carbon deposition over Ni/YSZ-X catalysts,"3.5 Carbon deposition over Ni/YSZ-X catalysts Fig. 9 showed the XRD patterns of Ni/YSZ catalysts after a 40-h reaction at 500°C. For direct comparison, XRD patterns of fresh catalysts were also presented. Characteristic XRD peak for graphitic carbon (2θ =26.2°) was observed in all the used catalysts. In the Ni/YSZ-0 (Ni/ZrO2) catalyst, in particular, not only strong XRD peak for graphitic carbon was observed but also characteristic XRD peaks for tetragonal zirconia were diminished. This indicates that tetragonal phase of mesoporous zirconia was collapsed during the reaction, leading to a poor catalytic performance of Ni/YSZ-0 (Fig. 6). In the case of Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts, however, XRD peaks for tetragonal zirconia were still maintained, although a weak peak for graphitic carbon was observed. Therefore, it can be summarized that the addition of yttria enhanced the resistance against carbon deposition and improved the structural stability of mesoporous zirconia in the Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts."
11,Conclusions,"Mesoporous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ-X) supports were prepared by a templating sol–gel method with a variation of Y/Zr molar ratio (X). Ni catalysts supported on YSZ-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) were then prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method, and were applied to hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. The effect of Y/Zr molar ratio on the catalytic performance of Ni/YSZ-X catalysts was investigated. Hydrogen selectivity over Ni/YSZ-X catalysts showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to Y/Zr molar ratio. Among the catalysts tested, Ni/YSZ-0.1 showed the best catalytic performance. All the Ni/YSZ-X (X =0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) catalysts showed a higher catalytic performance than the Ni/YSZ-0 (Ni/ZrO2), because oxygen vacancies and reducibility of NiO were enhanced by the addition of yttria. Yttria also played an important role in enhancing the resistance against carbon deposition and improving the structural stability of mesoporous zirconia in the Ni/YSZ-X catalysts during the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol."
