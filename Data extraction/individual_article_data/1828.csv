0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been receiving increasing attention as an ideal future energy carrier to replace fossil fuels [1]. Hydrogen has a high energy yield of 122 kJ/g, which is 2.75 times greater than hydrocarbon fuels [2]. Biologically, hydrogen can be produced by photo and dark fermentation [2]. Dark fermentation has advantages over the photo fermentation process in terms of being more cost-effective and that various kinds of substrates can be used [2]. Glycerol is the principal by-product obtained from the biodiesel production process. For every 10 kg of biodiesel produced, approximately 1 kg of glycerol is generated [3]. Glycerol is used in chemical, food, and beverage production. It is also used as a substrate for producing renewable fuels such as hydrogen, methane and ethanol [3–6]. Glycerol production has increased dramatically because of the increase in production of biodiesel in order to support energy demand. This increase in glycerol production far outweighs demand and has resulted in a significant decrease in glycerol prices. This research was carried out to investigate an alternative method of reducing the amount of waste glycerol, with a view to also adding value to the waste glycerol, by producing a renewable fuel, i.e., hydrogen. Previous research reported the use of glycerol to produce hydrogen by pure and mixed cultures. For example, Enterobacter aerogenes was used to produce hydrogen from waste glycerol in which a maximum hydrogen yield (HY) and a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 1.05 mol H2/mol glycerol and 0.063 mol H2/L h, respectively, were obtained [4]. A maximum HY of 0.05 mol H2/mol glycerol was obtained when mixed cultures from distillery wastewater was used to produce hydrogen from glycerol [7]. These results indicated that the HY and hydrogen production obtained were low. Therefore, hydrogen production from glycerol requires further improvement to increase the HY and HPR before being applied industrially. HPR could be enhanced by improving the cell retention in the fermentation system by selecting the most efficient fast growing microbial strains and increasing the amount and varieties of hydrogen producers in the fermentation system [8]. Immobilization techniques are widely used to enhance the cell retention and microbial activity [8,9]. The advantages of immobilized cells are reusability, process stability, high tolerances to environment interference and high cell retention [8,9]. Therefore, immobilization could lead to a high production rate and might be the best choice in terms of the feasibility of large scale and continuous processing [10]. Entrapment and adsorption methods are the most common immobilization techniques applied in the fermentation system [10]. In the entrapment methods, cells are trapped in insoluble beads or microspheres such as calcium alginate beads, while in the adsorption methods, cells are attached to the outside of the support material [10–13]. Previous reports have shown that the entrapment and adsorption methods improve the HPR and cell retention at higher dilution rates in a reactor system [11,13]. However, the adsorption methods have advantages over the entrapment methods such as less of them suffer from mass transfer resistance, and there is a reduction in damage to the support material structure during a gas production [12,13]. Therefore, we are interested in using the adsorption method to immobilize hydrogen producers, i.e., E. aerogenes on heat-treated upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) granules with the hope that this method would improve hydrogen production efficiency in the UASB reactor. Glycerol has a high viscosity that might cause a decrease in the substrate transfer to the microbial cell, which is an important step for bio-hydrogen production [3,4]. Therefore, an upflow system, i.e., UASB, was used in this study to eliminate the problem [8]. In addition, a UASB reactor offers high treatment efficiency and can operate at a high organic loading rate (OLR) [1,12,13]. The performance of the reactor system is influenced by a variation of environmental parameters such as the pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and OLR [14]. Among these parameters, the OLR is an important parameter for hydrogen production efficiency in a reactor system. However, a literature search shows that the relationship between HPR and OLR is not clear. In some cases, an increase in the OLR resulted in a decrease in the HPR and hydrogen content [15], whereas in other cases, an increase in the OLR resulted in an increase in the HPR and hydrogen content [16]. For example, an increase in the OLR of dairy wastewater to produce hydrogen in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) from 2.4 to 3.5 kg-COD/L d resulted in an increase in the HPR. However, an increase in the OLR above 3.5 kg-COD/L d resulted in a decrease in the HPR [14]. The optimum HPR of 1.105 mmol H2/L min was achieved at an OLR of 3.5 kg-COD/L d. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize OLR in order to achieve the maximum HPR. The main objective of this study was to investigate the optimum OLR for hydrogen production from waste glycerol in a UASB reactor in order to maximize the HPR. E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 immobilized on heat-treated UASB granules were used as the seed inoculum. Investigations into the bacterial community responsible for the fermentation of glycerol and the microbial structure were also conducted using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrates,"2.1 Substrates Pure glycerol (analytical grade) was purchased from Ajax Finechem Pty. Ltd. Waste glycerol was obtained from a biodiesel production process of Krungtep Produce Public Company Limited, Saraburi, Thailand. The company produces fried chicken in which approximately 202.60 tons of used oil is generated monthly. The average 44,000 L of biodiesel as well as 4400 L of waste glycerol is generated per month. Waste glycerol consists of (all in g/L): glycerol, 441.3; methanol, 230; NaCl, 10; soap, 17.7; total nitrogen, 0.5; and total phosphorus, 0.05."
3,Microorganisms and cultivation,"2.2 Microorganisms and cultivation UASB granules obtained from a UASB reactor were used as a seed inoculum and support material to immobilize E. aerogenes ATCC 13048. The UASB reactor was used to produce methane from wastewater from a beer production process. The UASB granules were heat-treated on a gas stove at 100 °C for 2 h in order to deactivate methanogenic bacteria. The volatile suspended solid (VSS) concentration of the UASB granules was 32.45 g-VSS/L. E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 was purchased from Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technology Research (TISTR), Bangkok, Thailand. The inoculum was prepared by cultivating E. aerogenes in nutrient broth (NB) (pH 5.0). The NB consists of (all in g/L): 10.0; peptone, 10.0; meat extract, 5.0; sodium chloride. The culture was incubated for 14 h, at 36 ± 2 °C and 50 rpm, before being used as the inoculum. The initial cell concentration was 1.50 × 106 cell/mL determined by hemocytometer."
4,Cell immobilization,"2.3 Cell immobilization An amount of 150 mL of heat-treated UASB granules and 100 mL of E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 (final cell concentration of 106 cell/mL) were added into a 500 mL UASB reactor. A UASB reactor has 450 mL of working volume and 50 mL of head space. The remainder of the active reactor volume (200 mL) was filled up with glycerol medium using pure glycerol as the substrate at an OLR of 25 g/L d (equivalent to a flow rate of 0.312 mL/min). Then reactor was capped with a rubber stopper and flushed with nitrogen gas for 20 min to create anaerobic condition. The reactor was operated in batch mode for 14 h in order to support bacterial growth and to establish cell attachment to the heat-treated UASB granules. The glycerol medium contained 25 g/L of glycerol as a carbon source, 0.20 g/L of urea concentration, 0.02 g/L of Na2HPO4, and 1 mL/L of Endo–nutrient solution [17]."
5,UASB start-up and operation,"2.4 UASB start-up and operation The 500 mL of UASB reactor was made from glass and was 4.8 cm in diameter and 27.7 cm in height (450 mL of working volume and 50 mL of head space). The schematic diagram of UASB reactor is presented in Fig. 1 . The UASB reactor contains the immobilized E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 on heat-treated UASB granules as inoculums (Section 2.3). The reactor was operated at a temperature of 37 ± 2 °C. UASB reactor was firstly operated with glycerol medium using pure glycerol as the substrate. This was conducted in order to reduce the chance of the toxicity effect from impurities contained in waste glycerol on the seed inoculum. The reactor was operated in the continuous mode at the lowest OLR of 25 g/L d (equivalent to flow rate of 0.312 mL/min) until it reached a steady state. The steady state of each OLR was determined by a constant or a variation of less than 10% in the hydrogen content, HPR, and glycerol consumption in the effluent. After reaching a steady state, the OLR was increased from 25 to 37.5, 50, 62.5 and 75 g/L d, respectively. The OLR was based on the concentration of glycerol contained in waste glycerol and the optimum OLR was determined by the maximum HPR. After obtaining the optimum OLR using pure glycerol as the substrate, the reactor was switched to the glycerol medium containing waste glycerol as the substrate in order to determine a suitable OLR for hydrogen production from waste glycerol. The OLR that yielded a maximum HPR, using pure glycerol as the substrate, was employed as the center value for varying the OLR. During operation, gaseous samples, liquid samples, temperature and pH were recorded. The pH value of the fermentation broth was checked every evening and was manually adjusted to 5.5 by adding 5 mol/L NaOH to the influent in order to maintain the pH inside the reactor. Liquid samples were collected to determine the glycerol concentration, the concentrations of biomass and soluble metabolite products (SMPs). At the optimum OLR, operated with waste glycerol, the immobilized E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 on heat-treated UASB granules was collected from the reactor to analyze the microbial community and microbial structure by FISH and SEM, respectively."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The biogas compositions including hydrogen, nitrogen, methane and carbon dioxide were determined using a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu 2014, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m stainless column packed with Unibeads C (60/80 mesh). The operation conditions of the GC were set according to Saraphirom and Reungsang [18]. Liquid sample was prepared using the method of Sittijunda and Reungsang [19] prior the analysis of glycerol, 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), alcohols (ethanol, butanol), and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentrations by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with ultraviolet (UV) (210 nm) and refractive index (RI) detectors. A 7.80 × 300 mm Vertisep™ OA 8 μm column was used for HPLC analysis. The HPLC condition followed the method described by Selembo et al. [20]. The detection limit for VFAs was 0.002% (w/v). The detection limit for glycerol, 1,3-PD, ethanol and butanol was 0.009% (w/v). The determination of coefficient (R 2) of the standard curves for analyzing concentrations of VFAs, glycerol, 1,3-PD, ethanol and butanol are in the ranges of 0.97–0.99. The pH was measured using a digital pH meter (Sartorius, Germany). At the steady state, the mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS) containing the granules and suspended cells in the fermentation broth was pulled out from the UASB reactor then grinded using mortar and further analyzed for VSS in order to determine the biomass concentration using the standard method [21]. The pattern of attachment and morphology of immobilized E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 on heat-treated UASB granules was investigated using SEM [22]. The molaric amount of hydrogen production (HP) (mmol H2/L) was calculated using the ideal gas law as: volumetric hydrogen production (ml H2/L)/(RT), where R = 0.08205784 L atm/K mol, and T = 310 K. HPR (mmol H2/L h) was calculated by dividing the molaric amount of hydrogen production (mmol H2/L) by the incubation time (h). HY (mmol H2/mol glycerol consumed) was calculated by dividing the molaric amount of hydrogen production (mmol H2/L) by the glycerol consumption (mol/L). Specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) (mmol H2/g-VSS h) was calculated by dividing the molaric amount of hydrogen production (mmol H2/L) by the biomass concentration (g-VSS/L)."
7,Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH),"2.6 Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) The FISH technique [23] was used to investigate the microbial community in the biofilm layer of the immobilized E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 on heat-treated UASB granules from the UASB reactor at the optimum OLR. Prior to the analysis of the microbial community by FISH, the outer layer (biofilm) of the granules was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde according to the method of Amann et al. [24]. The fixed biofilms were placed on Teflon-coated glass slides and dried overnight to prevent the cells from detaching in the subsequent steps. The specimen was dehydrated by successive 50%, 80%, and 98% ethanol washes (3 min each), air dried, and stored at room temperature. Probes labeled with the sulfoindocyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5, EUB338 (EUB338I, II, III) [25], ARCH915 [26], GAM42a [27], ALF1b [28], CF319 [28], LGC354 [24], HoAc1402 [29], and ENT183, were used as oligonucleotide probes to target all bacteria, Archaea, γ-Proteobacteria, α-Proteobacteria, cytophaga–flavobacterium group, Firmicutes (gram-positive bacteria with low G+C DNA content) including Clostridium, Bacillus, and Dialister sp., acidobacteria, and Enterobacter sp., respectively. The designed probe was tested using the probe match function of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) software package version 9 [30]. Images were visualized by a Zeiss LSM 510 (Thornwood, NY) confocal laser scanning microscope. The dye 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenilindol (DAPI) was used to corroborate that the observed fluorescence detected with the FISH technique corresponded to bacteria cells."
8,Calculation of chemical oxygen demand (COD) balance,"2.7 Calculation of chemical oxygen demand (COD) balance The concentrations of each fermentative product and biomass were converted to the COD concentration (mg-COD/L) following the method described by Adrianus and Jeroen [31]. The fermentative products included 1,3-PD, ethanol, butanol, lactic, formic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. The COD distribution of each fermentative product was calculated by multiplying the COD concentration by 100 and then dividing by the COD concentration of glycerol consumed. The COD distribution for glycerol consumption was set to −100. The COD balance was calculated as follows: (1) COD balance (%) = COD distribution of glycerol consumption+ ∑(COD distribution of fermentative products and biomass)"
9,Results and discussion,
10,Performance of the UASB reactor at various OLR,"3.1 Performance of the UASB reactor at various OLR The effect of the OLR on bio-hydrogen production from glycerol using a UASB reactor was investigated. The time course profiles of the biogas content, hydrogen content, HPR, pH, glycerol consumption and OLR are presented in Fig. 2 . The results indicate that variation in the OLR led to a variation in the biogas production, hydrogen content and HPR. An increase in the OLR did not affect glycerol consumption. Over 80% of the glycerol was degraded at an OLR lower than 62.5 g/L d. The biogases produced in this fermentation system were carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Methane was not detected indicating that the heat treatment of UASB granules and the slightly acidic conditions (pH 5–6.5) in the fermentation broth could inhibit the activity of methanogenic bacteria (Fig. 2). A summary of glycerol consumption, hydrogen content, HPR, SHPR and biomass concentrations at various OLR in the continuous UASB reactor obtained under steady state conditions is shown in Table 1 . Under UASB operation with pure glycerol, the maximum hydrogen content, HPR and SHPR of 37.1%, 9 mmol H2/L h and 2.7 mmol H2/g-VSS h, respectively, were obtained at the OLR of 50 g/L d, which indicated that the OLR of 50 g/L d was suitable for hydrogen production from pure glycerol in the UASB reactor (Table 1). After the optimum OLR was obtained, the media was changed to glycerol media containing waste glycerol as the substrate. Under operation with waste glycerol, the maximum hydrogen content and HPR of 24.2%, and 6.2 mmol H2/L h, respectively, were achieved at the OLR of 50 g/L d, whereas the maximum SHPR of 3.4 mmol H2/g-VSS h was obtained at the OLR of 37.50 g/L d, this was not significantly different from the value obtained from OLR of 50 g/L d (p > 0.05). The hydrogen content and HPR obtained from waste glycerol were 1.54 and 1.33 times lower than those obtained from pure glycerol (Table 1). The impurities in waste glycerol such as NaCl, methanol, and soap might be toxic to microorganisms; hence the biomass concentration was decreased (Table 1) [4–6]. Additionally, the presence of soap can cause blockages in the reactor and pipes and also reduce the substrate diffusion to the microbial cells causing a lower hydrogen content and HPR. Our results indicated that controlling of OLR is an important step in obtaining efficient hydrogen production. At higher or lower OLRs than the optimum level, adverse effects on hydrogen production occurred. The operation at a lower OLR than the optimum level implied that the concentration of substrate was lower than the optimum requirement for the microorganisms, which also reduces the growth and activity of microorganisms [32,33]. In addition, a low OLR could reduce the contact between substrate and microorganisms cells due to a low upflow velocity. However, an increase in OLR greater than the optimum level resulted in an increase in the upflow velocity, which could produce high substrate concentration and exceed the substrate inhibition level [32,33]. Furthermore, an increase in the substrate concentration to higher than the optimum level might develop osmotic pressure inside the cells, which can cause the damage on the microbial cells [32,33]. The concentrations of SMPs and the COD balance at the steady state of each OLR under operation with waste glycerol are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. SMPs including ethanol, 1,3-PD, formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and lactic acids were detected in the effluent. No butanol was detected. The COD balances at the OLR of 37.5, 50.0 and 62.5 g/L d were 4.68, 4.78, and 9.99% error, respectively. This indicates that the measurements of SMPs were quite accurate. The results indicate that the variation in OLR led to a variation in the SMPs (Table 2). The SMPs increased when the OLR was increased from 37.5 to 50 g/L d and decreased when the OLR was greater than 50 g/L d. Based on the SMPs results, the fermentative hydrogen production from waste glycerol was formate type fermentation, which obtained only 1 mol H2/mol glycerol. Generally, the conversion of glycerol to hydrogen was formate type fermentation. Maximum theoretical hydrogen yields of 1 mol were obtained when formate was the end products [4–6]. The maximum HY of 410 and 324 mmol H2/mol glycerol obtained using pure and waste glycerol as the substrate were considered low when compared to the theoretical yield. These results coincided with the detection of 1,3-PD, propionic acid and lactic acid in the fermentation broth. The production of 1,3-PD and propionic acid consumes the hydrogen whereas production of lactic acid does not yield hydrogen [5,6]. There are two metabolic pathways of glycerol degradation, i.e., the oxidative and reductive pathways. In the oxidative pathway, one mole of glycerol is converted to pyruvate. The further cleavage of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and formate by pyruvate formate liases (PFL) yields one mole of hydrogen, and the formate can be cleaved to one mole of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The oxidative conversion of acetyl-CoA to ethanol, acetate and butyrate, and the oxidative conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid do not yield hydrogen [3,6]. The high concentration of formic and acetic acids in the effluent correlated with the high hydrogen content and the HPR obtained at the optimum OLR of 50 g/L d (Tables 1 and 2). In the reductive pathway, glycerol is reduced to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde and then to 1,3-PD with no generation of hydrogen. A high concentration of 1,3-PD was observed at the OLR of 37.5 g/L d, which agreed with the low hydrogen content and HPR found under these conditions (Table 1 and 2). At the optimum OLR of 50 g/L d, a high ethanol yield (based on COD) (35.9%) was accompanied by a high 1,3-PD yield (26.8%), indicating that the microorganisms utilized glycerol through both the oxidative and reductive pathways."
11,Development of biofilm on heat-treated UASB granules,"3.2 Development of biofilm on heat-treated UASB granules SEM images and confocal laser scanning microscopy of immobilized E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 on heat-treated UASB granules are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 . The SEM images revealed that UASB granules possess excellent physical characteristics (high porosity) as a support material to immobilize E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 (Fig. 3B). The E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 attached to the heat-treated UASB granules inside their porous spaces, which indicated that E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 was immobilized on heat-treated UASB granules by an adsorption mechanism (Fig. 3C). E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 is rod shaped and is approximately 0.16 μm in length and 0.02 μm in diameter. Fig. 4A shows the biofilm layer of the immobilized E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 on heat-treated UASB granules. This result revealed that the microorganisms excreted the extracellular polymer (ECP) for extension of a new surface layer on the granules (biofilm) during the granulation process in the fermentation system. ECP might play an important role in agglutinating bacteria into granules and also in maintaining the structural integrity of granules [8,34]. An excision of ECP during the fermentation process is a function of several microorganisms including E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 and firmicutes bacteria. DAPI stained cells with a EUB338 probe (Fig. 4B) showed that the microorganisms in the granules belonged to Eubacteria (89.2%). Quantitative FISH (based on DAPI staining cells) demonstrated that the major groups of microorganisms presented in the granules are γ-Proteobacteria (34.5%), and firmicutes bacteria (18.81%). The other groups are α-Proteobacteria, cytophaga–flavobacterium group, acidobacteria and Archaea, which accounted for 7.9, 5.6, 6.7, and 2.3%, respectively. A high percentage of ENT183 probe (27.1%) target to Enterobacter sp. indicated the successful immobilization of E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 on heat-treated UASB granules and also indicated that E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 is a predominant hydrogen producing bacteria in this glycerol-feeding dark fermentation reactor. The detection of firmicutes bacteria suggested that other hydrogen producers in this fermentation system were Clostridium, Bacillus, and Dialister sp. Acidobacteria is another microorganism that presented in the fermentation system. The presentation of these bacteria groups correlates with the detection of propionic, acetic, lactic, and butyric acids in the fermentation broth. Archaea are assumed to be methane producers. The presence of Archaea might be due to the fact that UASB granules were obtained from the UASB reactor that was used to produce methane from wastewater in a brewery production process. The low amount of Archaea (2.3%) indicated that Archaea is not a dominant population in this fermentation system. This is because UASB granules were heat-treated in order to inhibit the activity of methanogenic bacteria. Consequently, methane was not obtained. The other unknown bacteria presented in the fermentation system accounted for 8.5%. Therefore, a new oligonucleotide probe should be designed to further check types of microorganisms present in the granules. The presence of other hydrogen producers, except E. aerogenes, indicated that the heat-treated UASB granules also acted as a seed inoculum in the fermentation system."
12,Evaluation of reactor process performance,"3.3 Evaluation of reactor process performance A highly improved HPR and biomass concentration were obtained when the immobilized E. aerogenes on UASB granules was used as the inoculum. At the optimum OLR of 50 g/L d, using waste glycerol as the substrate, a maximum HPR and biomass concentration (6.2 mmol H2/L h and 2.2 g-VSS/L) obtained from the immobilized E. aerogenes were 1.9 and 1.2 times greater than those obtained from non-immobilized UASB granules (3.3 mmol H2/L h and 1.9 g-VSS/L, respectively, manuscript in submission). We also found that the non-immobilized UASB granules could degrade waste glycerol in which the glycerol consumption by UASB granules at the OLR of 37.5, 50 and 62.5 g/L d were 58.3, 81.5 and 54.5%, respectively (manuscript in submission). These results indicated that the present system improved the hydrogen production rate, increased the cells retention and the number of E. aerogenes as well as other hydrogen producers in the fermentation system. A maximum HPR and biomass concentration of 6.2 mmol H2/L h and 2.2 g-VSS/L, respectively, obtained at the optimum OLR of 50 g/L d, using waste glycerol as the substrate, provide a better hydrogen performance in comparison to free cell systems in anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) [14] and other immobilized cell systems. This include granular UASB reactors [10]. However, the maximum HPR obtained in this study was lower than the HPR obtained with other immobilized cell systems such as packed bed reactors [12] and trickling biofilter reactors [36] (Table 4 ). Our experimental results indicated that the present system achieves satisfactory HPR and can be used to produce hydrogen from waste glycerol. Therefore, the potential application of our experimental results was to produce hydrogen from waste glycerol obtained from biodiesel production process in a high-rate continuous UASB reactor using the immobilized E. aerogenes on UASB granules as the inoculum. Moreover, not only hydrogen but also the valuable products such as 1,3-PD and ethanol were obtained at high concentrations from bio-hydrogen production process. Hydrogen, the product of interest, can be used as the renewable fuel while 1,3-PD can be used as the intermediates in plastic production process as well as in the cosmetics production process. Ethanol can be used to replace methanol in the biodiesel production process and also can serve as the renewable fuel [37]. Therefore, a high-rate continuous hydrogen reactor does not only reduce the amount of waste glycerol but also turning it into valuable products."
13,Energy conversion efficiency of the fermentation process,"3.4 Energy conversion efficiency of the fermentation process The total energy efficiency of glycerol was calculated based on the heat of combustion of glycerol, ethanol, hydrogen and 1,3-PD of 1674, 1377, 285, and 1859 kJ/mol, respectively. Under the optimum OLR using waste glycerol as the substrate, the maximum HY was 324 mmol H2/mol glycerol (Table 1) while the maximum ethanol yield was 480 mmol ethanol/mol glycerol (data not shown). Therefore, the energy conversion efficiency for hydrogen was [[(0.32·285)/1674]·100%] = 5.4%, and for ethanol [[(0.48·1377)/1674]·100%] = 39.4%. The total energy conversion efficiency from a co-production of hydrogen and ethanol gave the maximum energy conversion efficiency of 44.8%. The remaining 55.2% of total energy conversion efficiency might be due to the microorganisms converting glycerol to other metabolite products including formic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids (26.27%) and 1,3-PD (28.9%)."
14,Conclusions,"The maximum hydrogen content and HPR of 24.2%, 6.2 mmol H2/L h were achieved at the optimum OLR of 50 g/L d using waste glycerol as substrate. Microbial community and structure analyzed by FISH and SEM indicated that the hydrogen producer were E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Clostridium, Bacillus, and Dialister sp. Immobilized E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 on UASB granules gave 1.90 and 1.2 times higher in HPR and biomass concentration, respectively, than heat-treated UASB granules alone."
