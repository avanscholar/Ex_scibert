0,Introduction,"The demand for new sustainable energy sources as alternatives to fossil fuels is increasing exponentially as the reserves of fossil fuels decrease, and because the combustion of fossil fuels has brought serious negative effects on environment [1,2]. Hydrogen is considered one of the cleanest possible energy carriers due to its clean combustion with no CO2 emissions and efficient conversion to electricity via fuel cell technology [3]. In addition, hydrogen has a high-energy yield of 1.22×105 kJ/kg, which is 2.72 times greater than that of gasoline. In view of these advantages, the demand for a sustainable and sufficient supply of hydrogen is huge. Winter [4] has reported that 50 million tones of hydrogen are traded annually worldwide with a growth rate currently at nearly 10% per annum. Recently, biological hydrogen production technology, with the advantages of being cost-effective and pollution-free, and of offering energy-savings, was demonstrated to be a competitive alternative to the conventional hydrogen production methods such as steam reforming of methane (SRM), steam reforming of other hydrocarbons (SRH), and non-catalytic partial oxidation of fossil fuels (POX). Hydrogen can be produced biologically from light-dependent or -independent fermentative pathways using organic materials as the substrate [1,5]. Photo-hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) is regarded as a promising technology because of its high purity hydrogen production and high theoretical conversion yields [6]. PSB are able to use a wide spectral range (from 400 to 900nm) and do not present O2-evolving activity that causes problems of O2 inactivation for different biological systems [1,7,8]. In addition, PSB can consume organic acids derived from dark fermentation process for hydrogen production. These soluble metabolites produced during the acidogenic phase of anaerobic digestion in dark fermentation not only contribute to the high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and result in foul-smelling air, but also pose a long-term potential threat to the environment [9]. At present, a practical and efficient photo-hydrogen production technology is a growing concern among the research fraternity. In spite of the striking advantages, as compared with dark fermentation, the main challenge during the photo fermentative hydrogen production is the lower phototrophic hydrogen production rate, mainly due to the low growth rate of PSB and the inefficient light energy utilization [10–12]. Current research focuses on improving the photosynthetic microbial hydrogen conversion rate and the unit volumetric production rate of the photobioreactor. The former could be achieved by screening efficient hydrogen-producing bacteria, optimizing operating conditions, and improving the structure of the photobioreactor [13–15], while the latter is substantially influenced by biomass retention in the photobioreactor. Recently, immobilization techniques have been used for cell stabilization [16–19]. It is shown that immobilization processes is an effective approach to elevate biomass retention in bioreactors. In general, two immobilization strategies are employed: entrapment into polymers and adsorption onto porous and inert support materials [17]. Entrapment of bacteria has been widely studied because it provides both an appropriate growth environment for the organism [20] and structural, thermal and chemical stability to the entrapped cultures [21]. The immobilized cells technology focused on dark fermentation hydrogen production has been widely studied [22,23]. The favorable immobilized-cells anaerobic dark-fermentation hydrogen production systems mainly adopt the granulation processes. In these systems, relatively high unit volumetric hydrogen production rates are achieved on account of the elevated biomass retention [24]. The results show that the application of the immobilized cells technology in dark fermentation for hydrogen production introduced many important advantages, such as high retention of hydrogen-producing bacterial cells, high volumetric hydrogen productivities, and improved tolerance to inhibitors [5,22,25]. Zhang et al. [24] reported a maximum value of 6.6l/l/h for the dark fermentation hydrogen production rate of a granule reactor. Lee et al. [26] proposed a novel bioreactor containing a self-flocculated anaerobic granular sludge, which achieved an optimal volumetric hydrogen production rate of 7.3l/l/h. Currently, only a few studies on hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria entrapped in agar gel or in alginate beads have been reported [20,27]. However, it should be recognized that the photosynthetic bacteria immobilization of entrapment into polymers has a drawback due to the difficulties in the light penetration and transport of substrate and product [28,29]. Hence, transparent inorganic carriers with an adequate porosity are a promising family of materials used for photosynthetic bacterial entrapment, which can provide a higher density of loading and facilitate the light penetration and transport of substrate and product. In the present study, PSB cell immobilization is achieved by PVA granules crosslinked with boric acid solution. The main objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using a PVA-boric acid gel lattice containing immobilized PSB to improve the phototrophic hydrogen production rate, and then to determine the effects of key physiological and environmental conditions such as the influent concentration, the flow rate of the substrate solution, the illumination intensity and wavelength, the temperature, and the pH value, on the photo-hydrogen production rate of an immobilizing PSB granule."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and cultivation,"2.1 Microorganism and cultivation The photosynthetic bacteria used for phototrophic hydrogen production in the present study were isolated from municipal sewage sludge by repetitious purification. The bacterium was identified as Rhodopseudomonas palustris, which was named as R. palustris CQK 01. The strain was grown in a synthetic medium containing (per liter) 1.0060g of K2HPO4·3H2O, 0.5540g of KH2PO4, 0.3000g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.0018g of FeSO4·7H2O, 0.0025g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.0010g of ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.2000g of NaCl, 0.0150g of CaCl2, 1.5000g of CO(NH2)2, and 4.0240g of glucose. To improve the growing environment of the photosynthetic bacteria the yeast extract and growth factors of desired concentration were added to the synthetic medium. Argon gas was used to create anaerobic conditions. The cells were cultivated anaerobically at 30°C under the illumination of a light-emitting diode (LED) at an illumination intensity of approximately 4000lux. The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.1 using 0.1M NaOH."
3,Immobilization of bacterial cell,"2.2 Immobilization of bacterial cell After cultivation of the phototrophic bacteria in separate batch systems, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (12,000rpm, 12min) and then washed aseptically with deionized water. As carriers for the immobilized bacterial cells, a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium alginate was used due to its hydrophilicity, nontoxicity, and toughness. To prepare granules with the proper transparency and rigidity, we optimized parameters such as the concentration of sodium alginate, calcium chloride, and boric acid. For this purpose, we adopted different weight/weight ratios of PVA/alginate (9/1, 8/2, 7/3, 6/4, 5/5) and different w/v concentrations of boric acid (1%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.5%, and 2%) and of CaCl2 (0.5%, 0.75%, 1%, 1.25%, 1.5%). The experimental results showed that the granules, which were prepared using a weight/weight ratio of PVA/sodium alginate of 7/3 and then hardened using 1.1% (w/v) boric acid and 0.75% (w/v) CaCl2 solution, exhibited good transparency and no disruption or dissolution during the 20 day exposure period in the synthetic medium. For the preparation of the granules with the optimized parameters, PVA was mixed with sodium alginate at a weight/weight ratio of 7/3, and then 10g of the mixture was weighed out. The solution was prepared by adding the mixture with 0.5g of carrageenan to 50ml of distilled water, and was carefully heated to 80°C in a constant-temperature bath. After stirring for about 50min, the initially turbid mixture became clear due to the diffluence of PVA. The PVA-alginate slurry was then cooled to 25–30°C and mixed with 50ml of the suspension of centrifuged PSB cells using a magnetic stirrer. The dry weight of the PSB cells in 100ml of inoculum was approximately 0.07g. The well-mixed solution was extruded from a peristaltic pump and dropped into a cold 1.1% (w/v) boric acid solution containing 0.75% (w/v) CaCl2 to form single granules in which the initial load of the photosynthetic bacteria cells was nearly 0.35g/l. The PVA gel granules were crosslinked with boric acid solution for 18–24h. Hardening of the PVA gel granules with boric acid solution and CaCl2 significantly improved not only the gel strength but also the stabilization of the entrapped PSB cells. Then gel granules of 5.9±0.1mm in diameter were retrieved and washed thoroughly with physiological brine. The entire procedure of immobilization was carried out under sterile conditions. Finally, the PVA-boric acid gel granules containing immobilized PSB cells (hereafter referred to as PVA-PSB gel granules) were cultured in batch mode for 2 days to activate the hydrogen-producing activity prior to being used for the start-up of the photobioreactor. The hydrogen production rate of the PVA-PSB gel granules was calculated by dividing the hydrogen molar yield during the photo-fermentation time by the final dry weight of the PSB cells in the PVA-PSB gel granules."
4,Setup and operation of phototrophic hydrogen-producing bioreactor,"2.3 Setup and operation of phototrophic hydrogen-producing bioreactor The experimental system consisted of a photobioreactor, a light source, a constant-temperature bath, a peristaltic pump, a substrate medium flask, and an effluent flask (see Fig. 1 ). The photobioreactor was a sealed pure polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) vessel with a working volume of 15×15×10mm3 that was connected with the medium flask and the effluent flask using silicon hoses. The light source consisted of an LED mounted on the topside of the photobioreactor. The constant-temperature bath controlled the temperature of the influent medium. A 0.2mm diameter T-type thermocouple was inserted into the photobioreactor from the top to measure the temperature inside the bioreactor. Various illumination wavelengths and intensities, as well as influent substrate solution concentrations, flow rates, pH values, and temperatures were chosen to investigate their effects on the hydrogen production rate of a single PVA-PSB gel granule. Three series of LEDs, emitting at 630, 590, and 470nm, were adopted, and the light intensity was adjusted from 3000lux to 11,000lux by changing the distance between the LED and the photobioreactor. The glucose solution was used as the only carbon source for the photosynthetic bacteria. The flow rate of the medium was controlled by adjusting the rotation speed of the peristaltic pump, which was calibrated prior to the experiments. The duration of a photo-fermentation cycle under each specific operating condition was 24h. A new PVA-PSB gel granule was loaded in the photobioreactor after a set of experiments was finished (nearly every 7 days) to avoid disruption or dissolution of the granule in the nutrients medium. The photobioreactor was sterilized by formalin vapor before the PVA-PSB gel granule was loaded. In addition, the feed medium and silicon hoses were sterilized by an autoclave. In order to provide anaerobic conditions, the photobioreactor and silicon hoses were filled with substrate solution or deionized water and the upper space of the medium flask was purged by argon gas."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The mainly hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A two-meter long stainless steel column was packed with porous styrene particles with argon as the carrier gas flowing at a rate of 25ml/min. The temperature of the GC oven and TCD was maintained at 55 and 100°C, respectively. The electric current of the TCD was 80mA. Cell concentration of the culture was determined regularly by optical density measurement at a wavelength of 600nm (i.e., OD600nm) using a spectrophotometer. Gas samples were taken from the sampling port using a gas syringe at desired time intervals to measure the gas composition. The pH value was measured by a pH meter calibrated using buffers (pH of 4.0 and 7.0) supplied by the manufacturer. The rotation speed of the peristaltic pump was matched to the flow rate of the medium via proper calibration, with one revolution per minute corresponding approximately to 16ml/h. To investigate the inner structure of the PVA-PSB gel granules and the cells' retention using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the PVA-PSB gel granules were pretreated as follows. First, the samples were washed two times with the deionized water. The granules, with or without immobilized cells, were transferred to glutaraldehyde in a 0.1M phosphate buffer with a pH of 7.4 to fix the cells on the solid matrix. The metal impregnation was done by transferring the glutaraldehyde-fixed sample to OsO4 in the phosphate buffer, following which the sample was washed with the same buffer. The samples were dehydrated by successive transfer in a series of 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 95%, following which they were transferred to a freeze dryer. The dried samples were mounted on SEM stubs coated with gold. The solid structures were photographed by SEM (KYKY-EM 3200) using a 25kV accelerating voltage."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Electron microscopy of R. palustris CQK 01 in PVA-PSB gel,"3.1 Electron microscopy of R. palustris CQK 01 in PVA-PSB gel To assess the structure of the PVA-PSB gel granules and the arrangement of the cells within them, the gel granules containing 0.7mg cell dry weight/ml were characterized by SEM, as shown in Fig. 2 , which shows the microstructure of a transverse section of the solid support matrix with immobilized R. palustris CQK 01. It can be seen in Fig. 2(a), where the magnification factor is 3000, that the gel granule using PVA as a solid support matrix is adequately porous, and that the pores are mutually connected. There are a number of cells firmly attached to the surface of the solid support matrix. These stable net-work matrices can create a biocompatible environment that provides mechanical and chemical stability. Remarkably, the diameters of the pores are greater than the thickness of the wall, resulting in a huge specific porosity and surface area in the PVA-PSB gel granules. The huge porous microstructure of PVA gel matrices provides the ample room for the bacterial growth. That could help PVA-PSB gel granule overcome the problem of disruption caused by the bacterial growth. In addition, this porous microstructure facilitates the transfer of substrate, water, and products (H2 and CO2). The above two features make it possible to continuously operate the PVA-PSB gel granules. A stability test shows that the PVA-PSB gel granules used in this experiment can successfully and steadily evolve hydrogen for over 20 days and no granules disruption was observed. Fig. 2(b) shows a transverse section of the solid support matrix magnified by a factor of 10,000. It is obvious that a greater number of cells are aggregated on the surface of the solid support matrix, and that the distribution of cells is uneven. It appears that the transport processes of the substrate and the products as well as the metabolism reaction of the microorganisms in a single PVA-PSB gel granule are thoroughly complicated due to the complex porous microstructure and cell aggregation. Hence, a comprehensive investigation of the effects of the corresponding operating conditions on the hydrogen production rate is necessary and urgent."
8,Effect of influent glucose concentrations under different illumination wavelengths,"3.2 Effect of influent glucose concentrations under different illumination wavelengths It is known that the type and concentration of the carbon source are normally critical factors affecting the fermentation kinetics of biohydrogen production [30]. Furthermore, different types of photosynthetic bacteria may preferably absorb light energy at different wavelength ranges. Thus the illumination wavelength may also play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of cell growth and hydrogen production of photosynthetic bacteria [12]. It has been shown that near infrared light (750–950nm) plays an essential role for hydrogen photo-production since the bacteriochlorophyll a absorption maxima existing in this spectral region is very important for hydrogen production [31]. In the present study, the absorption maxima of R. palustris CQK 01 are at 370, 590, 790, and 890nm. The effects of the influent glucose concentration as well as the illumination wavelength on the hydrogen photo-production rate of the PVA-PSB gel granule are shown in Fig. 3 , where the substrate solution with different glucose concentrations (0.02–0.1mol/l) is fed into the photobioreactor under different illumination conditions (630, 590, and 470nm). During the experiments, the illumination intensity was set at 7000lux, the temperature at 30°C, the flow rate at 3.5ml/h, and the pH of the glucose solution at 7. Under 590 and 630nm illumination, the hydrogen production rate increases upon increasing the influent glucose concentration from 0.02 to 0.06mol/l, whereas it decreases appreciably when the glucose concentration further increases to 0.10mol/l (Fig. 3a). Accordingly, the highest hydrogen production rates occur at a glucose concentration of 0.06mol/l and are 2.4 and 2.1mmol/g cell dry weight/h, for illumination at 590 and 630nm, respectively. For illumination at 470nm, the maximum hydrogen production rate achieved is 1.7mmol/g cell dry weight/h at a glucose concentration of 0.08mol/l. This trend is due to the metabolic capacity of the microorganisms in the PVA-PSB gel granule being sufficient to eliminate glucose when the influent glucose concentration is low, resulting in an increase in the hydrogen production rate with increasing glucose concentration. However, further increasing the glucose concentration beyond the threshold value leads to the onset of substrate inhibition, hence the hydrogen production rate decreases. In addition to the hydrogen production rate, the glucose removal rate and the hydrogen yield are also used to assess the performance of the PVA-PSB gel granule. Fig. 3b shows that the glucose removal rate gradually increases upon increasing the glucose concentration from 0.02 to 0.1mol/l. This is mainly attributed to the enhancing glucose transport from medium phase into the gel granule with the increasing influent glucose concentration. However, the hydrogen yield initially increases upon increasing the glucose concentration from 0.02 to 0.06mol/l, then drops significantly when the glucose concentration exceeds 0.06mol/l, and this for all light wavelengths (see Fig. 3c). The decrease in hydrogen yield at high influent glucose concentration might also be attributed to substrate inhibition, which was observed in a similar study [30]. Fig. 3 also shows that, for a glucose concentration of 0.06mol/l, changing the illumination wavelength from 470 to 590nm increases the maximum hydrogen production rate and yield to 2.4mmol/g cell dry weight/h and 0.37mol H2/mol glucose, respectively. However the hydrogen production rate and yield decreases considerably to 1.7mmol/g cell dry weight/h and 0.3mol H2/mol glucose with an illumination wavelength of 630nm. We conclude that the illumination wavelength is critical to photo-hydrogen production."
9,Effect of influent substrate solution flow rate,"3.3 Effect of influent substrate solution flow rate The hydrogen production of the photobioreactor definitely relies on the substrate metabolized by the photosynthetic bacteria, and the amount of metabolized substrate depends on the influent substrate loading, which in turn is proportional to the flow rate of influent substrate solution for a given substrate concentration. The high substrate solution flow rate results in abundant substrate loading and mass transfer enhancement in the photobioreactor, thus improving hydrogen photo-production as long as the metabolizing capacity of the photosynthetic bacteria in the PVA-PBS gel granule is sufficient. On the other hand, for a specific photobioreactor volume, the substrate solution flow rate also determines substrate solution hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the photobioreactor. The low flow rate results in a long HRT, allowing sufficient transportation of the substrate from the liquid phase to the PVA-PSB gel granule, which results in a high photo-hydrogen production rate. In the present study, the effects of varying the influent substrate solution flow rate from 1.6 to 7.9ml/h on the hydrogen production of R. palustris CQK 01 in the PVA-PSB gel granules are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , where the operating conditions for the photobioreactor are 590nm for the illumination wavelength, 7000lux for the illumination intensity, 30°C for the temperature, and a pH of 7. Fig. 4 presents the hydrogen production rate, the glucose removal rate, and the hydrogen yield as a function of influent substrate solution flow rate with various glucose concentrations (0.02, 0.06, and 0.1mol/l). Fig. 5 presents the hydrogen production rate as a function of substrate loading for each influent glucose concentration. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, with the influent glucose concentration at 0.02mol/l, both the hydrogen production rate and the glucose removal rate of the PVA-PSB gel granules increase monotonically with flow rate between 1.6 and 7.9ml/h. The hydrogen yield, on the other hand, initially increases up to a flow rate of approximately 3.5ml/h, but then remains essentially constant up to a flow rate of 7.9ml/h. This trend is attributed primarily to the metabolizing capacity of the photosynthetic bacteria that is sufficient for substrate biodegradation when the influent glucose loading is low (see Fig. 5). However, for a high influent glucose concentration of 0.06mol/l, the hydrogen production rate and the glucose removal rate of the PVA-PSB gel granules initially increase with flow rate (also with inlet glucose loading, see Fig. 5), then reach a maximum value at 6.5ml/h, after which it remains constant. The hydrogen yield increases dramatically at first, then drops sharply to a steady value. It is expected that mass transportation dominates the hydrogen production process under low substrate loading, while the metabolizing capacity of the photosynthetic bacteria is the dominant factor under high substrate loading. Further increasing the influent glucose concentration to 0.1mol/l, it is found that the hydrogen production rate and the glucose removal rate show similar tendencies as just discussed for the low flow rate range, but reach a maximum value at a flow rate of 5.0ml/h, before dropping with increasing flow rate. The hydrogen yield drops severely across the entire flow rate range. This drop in both the hydrogen production rate and the hydrogen yield is attributed primarily to the substrate inhibition resulting from a much higher influent glucose concentration. This phenomenon is consistent with the results discussed in Section 3.2, where an inhibition effect on the glucose biodegradation rate occurs once the influent glucose concentration exceeds 0.06mol/l. The data in Fig. 5 show that the hydrogen production rate of the PVA-PSB gel granule reaches a maximum value of 3.6mmol/g cell dry weight/h (equivalent to 80.6ml/g cell dry weight/h) for an influent glucose loading of 0.47mmol/h under the operating conditions of 590nm illumination, 7000lux illumination intensity, and 0.06mol/l influent glucose concentration."
10,Effect of illumination intensity,"3.4 Effect of illumination intensity Another key parameter affecting the photo-hydrogen production rate of the photobioreactors is the illumination intensity. Previous studies indicate that high illumination intensity stimulates both the photo-hydrogen yield and production rate, but has an adverse affect on the light conversion efficiency. How does the illumination intensity affect the photo-hydrogen production of the PVA-PSB gel granule? The experimental results under the operating conditions of 0.06mol/l influent glucose concentration, 3.5ml/h flow rate, and pH of 7 are shown in Fig. 6 for different illumination wavelengths. It is found that the hydrogen photo-production rate of the PVA-PSB gel granule is sensitive to the illumination intensity. Furthermore, the effect of the illumination intensity is more significant at 590nm. The photo-hydrogen production rate initially increases with illumination intensity up to a certain threshold, after which it decreases with illumination intensity for all wavelengths. The maximum hydrogen production rate among the three cases is 2.4mmol/g cell dry weight/h, which occurs in the photobioreactor illuminated with 7000lux at 590nm. In conclusion, increasing in the illumination intensity enhances the photo-hydrogen production rate of the photobioreactor provided the illumination intensity remains below the threshold level. If the illumination intensity exceeds the threshold, photo-inhibition occurs and the photo-hydrogen production rate decreases."
11,Effect of influent substrate solution pH value,"3.5 Effect of influent substrate solution pH value Different influent substrate solution pH values may affect the behavior of the surface electric charges on microorganisms as well as the different activities of the microorganisms [32]. It is reported that the optimum condition for the growth of the anaerobic photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides VM81 and its maximum hydrogen production rate occurs at the pH value of 7.2, and that the photosynthetic bacterium cannot produce hydrogen when the pH value is below 4 [33]. The effect of pH on the hydrogen production rate of the PVA-PSB gel granule was conducted under the operating conditions of 0.06mol/l influent glucose concentration, 590nm illumination wavelength, 7000lux illumination intensity, and 3.5ml/h flow rate, with the results shown in Fig. 7 . It is found that the specific hydrogen production rate increases from 1.5mmol/g cell dry weight/h to a peak value of 2.4mmol/g cell dry weight/h as the pH value increases from 4 to 7. Further increasing the pH to 9 results in a severe decrease in the hydrogen production rate. Furthermore, it is noted that the hydrogen production rate is 1.5mmol/g cell dry weight/h at the pH value of 4, while it is only 1.3mmol/g cell dry weight/h at the pH value of 9. This is attributed to the PVA-PSB gel granule providing strong protection for the microorganisms from the inhibition of the acidic circumstance. This result indicates the remarkable inhibition of the alkalescent circumstance to the photo-fermentation capacity of PSB in the PVA-PSB gel granule."
12,Effect of influent substrate solution temperature,"3.6 Effect of influent substrate solution temperature It is well known that the activity of microorganisms is very sensitive to temperature. The activity of microorganisms is inhibited when the environmental temperature is not suitable for their growth. In this study, experiments were performed to find the optimum temperature for the maximum photo-hydrogen production rate of R. palustris CQK 01 in the PVA-PSB gel granule. The temperature in the photobioreactor was controlled by regulating the influent substrate solution temperature that in turn was regulated by a constant-temperature bath (see Fig. 1). The influent glucose concentration was fixed at 0.06mol/l, the illumination wavelength was 590nm, the illumination intensity was 7000lux, and the influent medium flow rate and pH value were 3.5ml/h and 7, respectively. Fig. 8 shows that temperature has a significant effect on the photo-hydrogen production rate of the PVA-PSB gel granule. With an increase in temperature from 25 to 30°C, the photo-hydrogen production rate increases to a maximum value of 2.4mmol/g cell dry weight/h. The hydrogen production rate decreases to 2.1mmol/g cell dry weight/h when the temperature is further increased to 38°C."
13,Assessment of phototrophic hydrogen production rate of present PVA-PSB gel granule for phototrophic hydrogen production,"3.7 Assessment of phototrophic hydrogen production rate of present PVA-PSB gel granule for phototrophic hydrogen production The photo-hydrogen production process is reported in the literature [12,13,30,31,34,35]. However, it is rather difficult to compare the present results with those in the literature due to differing experimental conditions and limited quantitative results. Table 1 summarizes data reported in the literature along with data from the present study. With the photobioreactor operating conditions set at 0.06mol/l influent glucose concentration, 590nm illumination wavelength, 7000lux illumination intensity, and 0.39mmol/h influent glucose loading, the hydrogen production rate of the PVA-PSB gel granule in the present study is maximized at 3.6mmol/g cell dry weight/h (equivalent to 80.6ml/g cell dry weight/h). This specific hydrogen production rate is higher than all published values currently known to the authors of the present study (see Table 1). The relatively lower hydrogen yield obtained in the present study may be attributed to using glucose as the sole carbon source, whereas photosynthetic bacteria prefer organic acids as carbon sources, as used in other studies [2]. The fact that a PSB cell immobilization technique can be applied to hydrogen photo-fermentation has an important implication for the development of efficient hydrogen production. The excellent hydrogen production rate obtained from our phototrophic hydrogen production immobilized cell granule indicates the potential of applying this PSB cell immobilization technique more widely."
14,Conclusion,"In this work, a new approach to improve hydrogen production rate for photo-fermentation hydrogen production process is developed. It is shown that an entrapment of viable cells of R. palustris CQK 01 in PVA-boric acid gel is effective in enhancing the phototrophic hydrogen production rate. The transparent gel ensured the effective light penetration. Its porous structure facilitated the transport of substrate and product, and helped the gel granule avoid the problem of disruption as a result of the bacterial growth, as evidenced by the long-term test. It is found that the PVA-PSB gel granules could evolve hydrogen steadily over at least 20 days, and no granules disruption was observed. It is also found that the illumination at 590nm showed the highest rate of hydrogen production and hydrogen yield, as compared with the cases at 470 and 630nm. Besides, light illumination intensity has a significant influence on the photo-hydrogen production rate, particularly under the illumination at 590nm. The hydrogen production rate increases with flow rate when the metabolizing capacity of PSB in the PVA-PSB gel granule is sufficient for the biodegradation of the substrate solution. The pH value and temperature of the influent medium significantly influences the hydrogen production rate of the PVA-PSB gel granule as well. A maximum hydrogen production rate of 3.6mmol/g cell dry weight/h is obtained when the influent substrate loading is 0.47mmol/h. This performance is highly competitive with results of comparable studies, indicating the potential of applying the immobilized PSB technique in phototrophic hydrogen production. The good photo-hydrogen production rate achieved in the present study justifies the interest of using cell immobilization technology with photosynthetic bacteria immobilization in a PVA-boric acid gel lattice in future applications."
