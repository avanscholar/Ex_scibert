0,Introduction,"Nanosized noble metals have opened unprecedented opportunities for wide range of chemical applications, such as organic synthesis, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, etc [1–5]. Their catalytic performance is significantly influenced by surface composition, size, morphology and facet availability. Controllable synthesis of nanocatalysts with desired functions has long been a goal in the field of nanoscience and chemical catalysis. In the classical ‘bottom up’ route to prepare metallic nanomaterials (MNMs), metal salts are reduced to zerovalent nanometals and dispersed by stabilizers, which are used to prevent material aggregation caused by the high surface energy. Citrate, thioethers and alkanethiolate ligands are typical caping reagents used to protect nanometals, in which electrostatic repulsion or steric effects are used to increase colloid stability. Unfortunately, this ‘bottom-up’ method frequently involves the use of non-natural stabilizers, organic solvents and elevated temperatures to generate structures with specific features. To alleviate high energy input and address environmental concerns, green catalytic systems with excellent reaction activities are highly desired. In recent years, NMs fabricated via biologically-inspired approaches are emerging as attractive candidates for applications in many research fields such as lithium ion batteries [6,7], catalysis [8,9], electronics [10,11], bio-imaging [12,13], and drug delivery [14,15], etc. Such approaches hold some inherent advantages over traditional chemical methods. Biobased synthesis can be much more energy efficient. The reactions are generally carried out under ecologically benign conditions (room temperature, water as the solvent) and employ green and renewable sources as supports/capping agents, which mainly include peptides [16–18], proteins [19–21], DNA [22,23], and some microorganisms [24–26]. Additionally, the self-assembly properties of some biomolecules make them the following (facile templates) should be combined to here as one sentence, no space. fsacile templates to organize nanoparticles (NPs) into different patterns by varying the solution conditions. Moreover, the abundant surface functional groups on such bio-templates can be modified through genetic modification and bioconjugation to provide numerous possibilities for nucleation events. For example, a series of genetically engineered filamentous M13 bacteriophages have served as versatile building blocks for the fabrication of nanowires and nanonetworks [27–30], which are difficult to synthesize using nonbiological methods under mild conditions. Among the bio-templates mentioned above, peptides are the most extensively explored for biocatalyst fabrication due to their ready availability, simple structure and easy modification. Compared to most peptides, proteins have longer sequences of amino acid and more complex hierarchical structures, thus providing more diverse patterning for NPs. From a catalysis perspective, some bulkier protein structures may passivate the NP surface to a lesser extent, thus exposing a larger surface area for the approach of small reactant molecules to improve catalysis efficiency. Tobacco mosaic virus coat protein (TMVCP) is the capsid protein of TMV. This plant virus is a rod-shaped particle, with a single stranded RNA genome surrounded by 2130 identical coat protein subunits forming a helical tube [31,32]. Interestingly, the morphology of the RNA-free coat protein is dependent on the pH and ionic strength of the solution [33]. For example, it self-assembles predominantly into disk forms in pH 6.5∼7.5. In higher pH solutions, the disk disassembles into smaller A-protein (a mixture of monomers and oligomers, a single subunit contains 158 amino acid residues). The complete virion form [34,35] and the RNA free disk protein [36,37] have been successfully utilized as versatile building blocks for 3D metallic nanomaterial growth/deposition. However, A-protein remains less explored for mediating the production of nanoarchitectures. In this contribution, we demonstrate that A-protein (hereafter denoted as TMVCP) is able to support the growth of highly active green catalysts. Specifically, near spherical Pd, Pt and Au NPs were produced under ambient conditions. These metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) were tested for two organic reactions in aqueous media, i.e., 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction and olefinic alcohol hydrogenation. The kinetic results showed that Au and Pd NPs exhibited exceptional catalytic efficiency towards 4-NP reduction and allyl alcohol hydrogenation, respectively. Studies have shown that these two organic reactions follow the heterogeneous-type mechanism when catalyzed by nanometals rather than the atom/ion leaching mechanism [38,39]. The nanometals aided the electron transfer process between the two reactants to lower the kinetic barrier. In the heterogeneous mechanism, reactant molecules in solution must first penetrate through the protective ligand layer to reach the NP surface in order to drive the reaction to form products. Therefore, reaction activity is a function of the available surface area of the NPs, with a larger free surface area giving more rapid kinetics. In this regard, densely packed ligands that interact strongly with the NP surface not only block some metal surface but also hinder the diffusion rate of reagents, leading to diminished reaction rate [40]. One key advantage of using TMVCP-templated catalysts we explored in this study is that the bulky protein has rather minimal passivation of the metal surface in spite of the induced high NP colloid stability, which is of great significance for heterogeneous catalytic systems. We demonstrate this mechanism via a combination of experimental evidence and computational simulations. Our circular dichroism results indicate that the conformation of protein is generally conserved well before and after binding to the nanoparticle. In order to gain further insights on this binding regime and explore the molecular details, an atomistic molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of a TMVCP-Pd NP-water-propanol system was performed for allyl alcohol hydrogenation reaction. Our simulations revealed that even in the presence of proteins, a large catalytically active surface area is exposed to solvent and small solutes. Moreover, from this simulation, the number of propanol molecules adsorbed on one Pd NP surface was quantified and was shown to be in good agreement with the number derived from experimental turnover frequency (TOF), which further confirms the high catalytic activity of the catalyst. Overall, we conclude that this protein-NP system has the combined benefit of an eco-friendly synthetic method and outstanding structure-activity performance for heterogeneous catalysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Na2PdCl4, Na2PtCl6 6H2O, NaAuCl4 2H2O, NaBH4, allyl alcohol, 3-buten-ol, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, crotyl alcohol, 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, acrylic acid, acrylic amide, N-iso-propylacrylamide, 4-nitrophenol, sodium borohydride, dimethyl sulfoxide and deuterium oxide were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Tris Base and hydrochloric acid were acquired from Fisher Scientific. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Millipore MilliQ water (18.2 MΩ cm) was used throughout."
3,Fabrication of TMVCP-templated MNPs,"2.2 Fabrication of TMVCP-templated MNPs TMVCP was expressed and purified according to a previously reported procedure [37]. The purified protein stored at −80 °C in PBS (20 mM, pH 7.0) was thawed to room temperature and dialyzed into pH 8.9. Dialysis was carried out over 24 h in Tris−HCl buffer (15 mM) using dialysis membrane tubing with 12 k-14 k MWCO (Spectra/Pro). The protein concentration was determined by the absorbance at 282 nm (1.27 mL (mg cm)−1) using UV–vis (UV–vis) spectroscopy. To synthesize Pd NPs, 15 μL of Na2PdCl4 solution (50 mM) was incubated with 400 μL of protein (0.24 mg/ml in 15 mM Tris−HCl buffer, pH 8.9) and gently stirred for 3 h. 15 μL of freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (150 mM) was then added to the above solution. The mixture turned dark brown immediately. Stirring was continued for 1 h and the reaction mixture was then allowed to stand for another 1 h before characterizations or catalysis tests. Pt NPs and Au NPs were prepared with the same procedure as the Pd NPs, using Na2PtCl6 6H2O and NaAuCl4 2H2O as the metal precursors, respectively."
4,Material characterizations,"2.3 Material characterizations All UV–vis spectra were obtained with an Evolution 260 Bio UV–vis spectrometer employing a 1.0 cm quartz cuvette. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images were acquired using a Talos 300 TEM operating at 200 kV. The samples were prepared by drop-casting 10 μL of nanomaterial suspensions onto carbon-coated copper grids (Ted Pella) for 5 min, after which the residues were removed with a filter paper. Size distributions of MNPs were measured by counting at least 300 random particles using ImageJ software. The crystallinity of MNPs was analyzed from HR-TEM and SAED patterns. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS system with a monochromatic Al Kα source (ħν =1486.6 eV). Circular dichroism (CD) characterization was performed at room temperature using an Applied Photophysics CD spectrometer. 350 μL of sample solutions were injected into a quartz cell with a 5 mm path length. A total of seven scans (scan rate: 2 nm/s) were performed for each sample and averaged. The signal of pure Tris−HCl buffer was subtracted. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker 500 MHz NMR spectrometer."
5,MNP-catalyzed 4-nitrophenol reduction,"2.4 MNP-catalyzed 4-nitrophenol reduction The procedure for MNP catalyzed 4-nitrophenol reduction was adapted from previously published literature [41,42]. In a 1.0 cm cuvette, 15 μL of as synthesized Pd NP solution was diluted with 785 μL of MilliQ water into 800 μL. For catalyst tests with other amounts, sufficient water was added to keep a total volume of 800 μL. 120 μL of freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (0.1 M) was then mixed with the above suspension and left undisturbed for 7 min. After that, 400 μL of 4-nitrophenol solution (200 μM) was added. Immediately after the addition, time dependent UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded from 500 nm to 250 nm, with a time interval of 7 s for 4 min. To determine activation energy, experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 8 to 39 °C. The catalyst concentration was calculated from the initial reagent concentration. Catalytic experiments using Pt and Au NPs were carried out under identical conditions."
6,MNP-catalyzed allyl alcohol hydrogenation,"2.5 MNP-catalyzed allyl alcohol hydrogenation In a 10 ml round bottom flask, 14.6 μL of Pd NP (0.05 mol% loading) solution was diluted with water into 4 mL. The suspension was bubbled with hydrogen gas for ∼10 min at a flow rate of 15 mL/min and the flask was then sealed with a rubber stopper and parafilm. To initiate the reaction, 3.05 mg of allyl alcohol in 1 ml of water was injected into the suspension and stirred at room temperature. To calculate TOF values, 500 μL aliquots were extracted at predetermined time points and prepared for 1H NMR measurements. Dimethyl sulfoxide served as the internal standard to quantify the product. D2O was the deuterium solvent. Experiments with Pt NPs and Au NPs followed the same procedure."
7,Molecular dynamic simulations,"2.6 Molecular dynamic simulations MD simulations were run on the combined system of six TMVCP subunits surrounding one Pd NP and one thousand dissolved propanol molecules in a 303 nm3 water box. This initial configuration was constructed based on experimental concentrations and chemical intuition. It remained stable for the duration of the production simulations (30 ns) with only minor fluctuations in the adsorption patterns. We chose to simulate propanol rather than the allyl alcohol because propanol is the product of the hydrogenation reaction of allyl alcohol and the two structures occupy a similar area on the surface of the Pd NP. Thus, for the purpose of our simulation, these two are interchangeable and propanol was chosen due to readily available forcefield parameters [43]. GROMACS/2020.4 was used as our MD engine with the OPLS-AAM forcefield with SPC/E water [44]. Propanol was modelled using the forcefield developed by Jorgensen et al. [43], and the Pd NP was modelled using the Interface MD parameters for fcc Pd reported in the work by Heinz et al. [45]. In all simulations, the Verlet cut-off scheme was used with 1 nm cut-offs for nonbonded interactions, and the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) for long-range electrostatics was used with a PME order of 4, and a Fourier spacing of 0.16. Following the initial minimization and preliminary equilibration preparatory simulations, the production NVT run was performed with a Berendsen thermostat at 300 K for 30 ns with 2 fs time-steps and molecular configurations were recorded for analysis at 10 ps intervals. A Python module was used to analyze the data [46]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and characterizations of TMVCP-templated MNPs,"3.1 Synthesis and characterizations of TMVCP-templated MNPs Pd, Pt and Au NPs were prepared in a facile two-step process as shown in Fig. 1 . Metal salts were first incubated with protein in Tris−HCl buffer, in which amino acid residues on the TMVCP with can bind with the metal-chloro complexes through electrostatic interaction [34,47]. Adding excess amount of NaBH4 leads to a rapid solution color change from pale yellow to dark brown (Pd and Pt) or purple (Au), indicating the formation of zerovalent nanomaterials. No obvious precipitation was observed, suggesting that the TMVCP enables NP high colloid stability. The reduction process was monitored by UV–vis (UV–vis) spectroscopy as displayed in Fig. 1. In the pre-reaction spectra (Fig. 1b), the absorbance peaks in the range of 300∼400 nm come from the unreduced metal salts (same features with metal salts alone in Tris−HCl buffer, Figure S1 in SI). In the post-reaction spectra (Fig. 1c), the metal peaks disappeared, indicating the reduction of metal ions. Specifically, for Au NPs, there is an absorbance band centered around 540 nm, which is typical of plasmonic Au NPs larger than 2 nm [48]. Upon exposure to light, the surface conduction electrons of Au NPs are stimulated and induces a localized collective oscillation of electron cloud, resulting in a plasmonic band in the visible frequency of UV–vis spectrum [49]. Additionally, the absorbance at around 280 nm for both Au and Pd NPs is from the protein, while it is more featureless in the Pt NPs. Compared to pure protein, the higher absorbance values at ∼280 nm are attributed to the scattering effect of NPs. The size, shape and crystallinity of the as synthesized MNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Representative TEM images confirmed the formation of MNPs in Fig. 2 a-c. For all the three materials, near spherical NPs with uniform size distribution were observed, demonstrating that the TMVCP can well control the growth of NPs. The particle size distribution histograms (Fig. 2g-i) revealed that the average diameters of Pd, Pt and Au NPs are 3.44 ± 0.51 nm, 3.05 ± 0.49 nm, 2.86 ± 0.49 nm, respectively. NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent that often leads to formation of nanoparticles with small sizes. No obvious change in morphology and size was observed with slightly varying ratios of the metal salts to protein and incubation time. For example, with higher concentrations of Na2PdCl4 or longer incubation time, similar sizes were obtained for Pd NPs (Figure S2 in SI). HRTEM images (insets) showed that (111) is the dominant facet for all the three materials by measuring the interlayer spacings. In addition, all the SAED results (Fig. 2d-f) displayed Scherrer ring patterns assigned to [111], [200], [220] and [311] planes, suggesting the formation of fcc crystal lattice of MNPs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to probe the surface composition and electronic state of the protein-templated MNPs. Fig. 3 a-c shows the XPS spectra of core level Pd 3d, Pt 4f and Au 3d peaks, respectively. Deconvolution of the fitted data reveals that the metals have different charging states on the protein. In the deconvoluted Pd 3d spectrum, the doublet peaks located at 335.32 eV and 340.52 eV can be assigned to the zerovalent Pd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 respectively, confirming the formation of NPs. In addition, peaks with higher binding energies (orange peaks at 337.32 eV and 342.42 eV) are also observed, which indicates small amount of oxidation during sample preparation after synthesis. Similar result was obtained for Pt NPs, in which Pt° 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 have binding energies at 71.01 eV and 74.36 eV respectively, while the oxidized species locate at 72.51 eV and 75.80 eV. Compared to Pd and Pt NPs, Au NPs have a smaller amount of oxidation, as indicated by its smaller area ratio of the orange peaks. The spectrum deconvolution result in Au° at 83.39 eV and 87.08 eV, Au oxides at 85.48 eV 88.78 eV. The secondary structural composition of the TMVCP was examined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in Fig. 3d. The protein spectrum is similar to results in several previous reports [50,51], in which the negative band at 208 nm and the shoulder around 220 nm suggest the dominant presence of α-helix conformations. In the protein-MNP mixture spectra, the features of the band shape remained relatively constant, indicating that the protein conformation in general conserves well after binding to MNPs (the difference in ellipticity magnitude might be due to slight difference in concentration). However, the CD results are not able to provide enough information on the detailed binding patterns of TMVCP on the metal surface. To uncover the role of protein’s structural aspects in the catalysis, computational studies were conducted which will be discussed later."
10,Catalytic 4-nitrophenol reduction,"3.2 Catalytic 4-nitrophenol reduction Nitrophenols are commonly used in the synthesis of pesticides, plasticizers and dyes, which can cause serious environmental concerns with their release into wastewater [52]. Reduction of nitroaromatics is an efficient method both for eliminating hazardous pollutants and for producing aromatic amines, which are significant chemicals in industrial applications (e.g., as corrosion inhibitors, and as intermediates for pharmaceuticals, etc). The reduction of 4-NP is one of the most widely adopted model reactions to evaluate the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts since 1) there are no by-products formed; 2) the reaction can be carried out in water at room temperature; 3) the reaction rate can be easily monitored via time resolved UV–vis spectroscopy for kinetic studies [53]. Studies have demonstrated that mechanistically, the reduction takes place directly on the NP surface [39]. Addition of NaBH4 to the catalyst solution can produce active hydrogen species on the metal surface. This hydrogen then reacts with the newly added 4-NP to form an unstable intermediate 4-nitrosophenol, which is then converted to 4-hydroxyaminophenol and finally 4-aminophenol (4-AP). Fig. 4 a presents the time-dependent UV–vis monitoring of the 4-NP reduction catalyzed by 20 μM Au NPs in water at room temperature. In alkaline pH, 4-NP deprotonates to 4-nitropheonlate ion with a strong absorbance peak at 400 nm. As the reaction time increased, its peak intensity gradually decreased, and accompanied by the emergence of a new peak at 310 nm corresponding to the generation of 4-aminophenol. The spectrum was recorded for about 4 min when the reaction was complete as the 400 nm peak reached almost zero. This was confirmed by the solution color change from initial bright yellow to light purple in the end. In the control experiment without any catalyst, only little change in peak intensity at 400 nm was observed (see Figure S3 in SI), indicating that NaBH4 alone could not efficiently reduce 4-NP and catalyst was necessary to lower the kinetic barrier. Given that NaBH4 is in significant excess amount (150-fold in molar) compared to 4-nitrophenol, the reaction can be regarded as a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to the 4-nitrophenol concentration. Therefore, the reaction rate constant (k) is used to evaluate the catalytic activity of MNPs. To study the kinetics, ln(C/C0) (data taken from absorbance values at 400 nm) was plotted against reaction time and comparison was made between Au and Pd NPs at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 4b (our preliminary results showed that compared to Au and Pd NPs, Pt NPs were much slower for 4-NP reduction, thus no further experiments with Pt were continued). C is the 4-NP concentration at time t and C0 is its initial concentration. According to Eq. (1), k is the slope value of the fitted linear region. The obtained k values for Pd NPs and Au NPs are 6.32 × 10−3 s-1 and 13.80 × 10−3 s-1 (same catalyst concentration), respectively. This suggests that Au NP has higher catalytic activity than Pd NPs. To check the effect of catalyst concentration, different amounts of both catalysts were applied to the reaction (Fig. 4c). As expected for both materials, larger k values were obtained at higher catalyst concentrations. In addition, Au NPs exhibited higher activity than Pd NPs for all measured concentrations. (1) - k t = ln ( C t C 0 ) (2) ln k = ln A - E a R T To further compare the performance of Au NPs and Pd NPs, the activation energy (Ea) was determined by carrying out experiments at four different temperatures from 8 to 39 °C. Table 1 presents the results of k at each temperature for Au and Pd NPs with the same concentration, each averaged from triplicates. For all four temperatures, Au NPs outperform Pd NPs with larger k values. ln (k) was then plotted as a function of 1/T (temperature in Kelvin) in Fig. 4d and a linear relationship was observed for both materials. Ea (in kJ/mol) was then calculated from the slope of the fitted trend line, which follows the Arrhenius equation (Eq. 2). A is the pre-exponential factor and R is the gas constant. Ea values of 17.74 and 15.22 kJ/mol were obtained for the 4-NP reduction catalyzed by Pd NPs and Au NPs, respectively. This indicates that Au NPs are able to drive the reaction more easily than Pd NPs. Combining the results of rate constant and activation energy, we can be confident that among all three protein-templated MNPs, Au NPs exhibited the best performance towards catalyzing 4-NP reduction. As mentioned above, in 4-NP reduction, the BH4 − adsorbs on the metal surface and directly transfers the H− onto the metal surface, which then attacks the 4-NP substrate. During this process, the electronic property of the metal plays an important role. The higher k values of Au maybe partially explained by its faster electron transfer rate with an electron-rich surface [54,55]. In addition, Au NPs have the smallest size among the three catalyst, which can be the second reason for their higher activity. Nevertheless, other factors such as adsorption rate of 4-NP/BH4 − and desorption rate of 4-AP product can also differ among the metals. The present outcome may be ascribed to multiple factors. At this moment, a full interpretation of the activity order Au > Pd > Pt is challenging and needs further studies on each step during 4-NP reduction. The recyclability of Au and Pd NPs were examined by running the 4-NP reduction for six times and the resultant k values were shown in S5 in SI. For Au NPs, the k value was as high as 96 % in the 6th cycle, demonstrating their good cycling potential. Pd NPs showed lesser stability, maintaining ∼72 % in the 6th cycle. The decrease in the k may be attributed to the gradual accumulation of 4-AP product on the NP surface that can block some active sites [56]. TEM and XPS were further employed to characterize the morphology and surface charge of the recovered two catalysts after cycling tests. It was observed by TEM (Figure S6 in SI) that both MNPs remained almost unaltered in particle shape and size, in which Au NPs showed an average diameter of 3.00 ± 0.56 nm, and Pd NPs gave 3.53 ± 0.65 nm. Interestingly, XPS (Figure S7 in SI) results showed that the binding energies of Au° 4f5/2 and Pd° 3d3/2 decreased by around 0.6 eV and 1.0 eV, respectively. The decrease in the binding energy may be attributed to the 4-AP product, which absorbed onto the NP surface as a ligand and induces change in the electronic states of the NP surface [57]. Also, some BH4 − (electron donor) might be still absorbed on the NP surface and resulted in an electron enriched metal state. In order to compare the catalytic activity of TMVCP-Au NPs with literature results, k was normalized by amount of Au elements (μmol) to obtain knor. Table 2 listed the comparison of knor and Ea with some representative sub 15 nm Au nanocatalysts. It can be seen that Au NPs with smaller sizes (entries 1, 3–6, 8) generally give higher knor compared to those with larger sizes (entries 2, 7), which can be attributed to the higher surface-to-volume ratio with smaller NPs. However, size is not the only decisive parameter for catalytic performance. As compared in entries 5, 6, 8, NPs with diameters 2∼4 nm showed different Knor and Ea values, suggesting that the template has great impact on catalytic activity. Overall, our TMVCP templated Au catalyst exhibited excellent activity, as demonstrated by its higher knor and lower Ea values compared to typical Au NPs stabilized by polymer (entry 1), carbon support (entry 2), peptides (entries 3–6), and ESM (entry 7)."
11,MNP catalyzed olefinic alcohol hydrogenation,"3.3 MNP catalyzed olefinic alcohol hydrogenation Pd based nanocatalysts are known to be highly active for a series of organic reactions, such as hydrogenation, cross couplings, alkylation, etc [58–61]. In this work, TMVCP-templated Pd NPs were assessed for catalyzing hydrogenation of olefinic alcohols, which are important reactions for producing useful saturated alcohols in fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis. The simplest structure allyl alcohol was first used as the model substrate. Similar to NP catalyzed 4-NP reduction, the allyl alcohol hydrogenation occurs on the metal surface, via a Pd-alkyl mechanism [38]. Molecular hydrogen dissociates on the Pd surface to form a Pd-H species, which then coordinates with the π-bond of the allyl alcohol. With an anti-Markovnikov insertion pattern, hydrogen atom is added to the α carbon and forms the linear Pd-alkyl intermediate and finally produces n-propanol. The Pd surface was saturated with hydrogen species by bubbling H2 gas into Pd NPs dispersed in water, followed by rapid injection of allyl alcohol to initiate the reaction. The catalytic activity was evaluated by TOF values, which were calculated by extracting certain amount of reaction mixture at different time points for NMR quantification. Significantly, with a 0.05 mol% metal loading, Pd NPs achieved a high TOF value of 6382 ± 258 mol product (mol Pd × h)−1. No product was produced in the absence of Pd NPs, confirming the catalytic activity of the material. Note that during the reaction, a small amount of the isomerization product propionaldehyde was also observed in NMR. Nevertheless, it was fully converted to the n-propanol afterwards, therefore the TOF value also contains the propionaldehyde contribution for easy comparison with previous studies. Pt and Au NPs were also tested for the allyl alcohol hydrogenation. Interestingly, while Pt NPs gave small TOF (740 mol product (mol Pt × h)−1), Au NPs could not catalyze the reaction. This can be attributed to their lower capacity to dissociate molecular dihydrogen on the metal surface, as well as the weaker interaction with CC bond in the allyl alcohol, which resulted in a rather high reaction barrier to activate CC bond and thus lower reaction rate [62–64]. According to the TOF value for allyl alcohol hydrogenation, the catalytic activity of TMVCP-templated Pd NPs exceed any reported Pd nanocatalysts with similar size, shape and hydrogenation conditions (see Table S1 in SI). For example, a variety of Pd NPs embedded in polyelectrolyte (PEI) films [72,73], supported on solid composites [73] and stabilized by organic ligands [40,74] have been employed for allyl alcohol hydrogenation. One early study of 1.7 nm Pd NPs encapsulated into poly(amidoamine) dendrimers reported a TOF of 480 mol H2 (mol Pd × h)-1 [75], whereas thiolate ligands such as S-alkythiosulfates can be relatively densely packed on the NP surface and lead to diminished activity (310 mol product (mol Pd × h)−1 [40]. Pd NPs capped by bio-templates such as peptides have also been studied for this reaction and generally showed higher TOFs. For instance, Knect’s group has successfully developed a series of peptides [76] and peptoids [77] to support Pd NP growth. Specifically, spherical Pd NPs were capped by Pd4 peptide and a series of analogues, with one optimized analogue achieving the highest TOF 6100 ± 200 mol product (mol Pd × h)-1 [76]. They also employed a R5 peptide to produce Pd nanostructures with different morphologies, the TOF values were all around 3000 mol product (mol Pd × h)-1 [78]. To explore the scope of the protein-Pd NP system for hydrogenation reactions, unsaturated alcohols with different shapes and sizes were tested under the same reaction conditions, as shown in entries 2–7 in Table 3 . The TOFs varied depending on the molecule size and substituents. As expected, the substitution pattern of the carbon-carbon double bond has more impact on TOF than that of the α-carbon of the double bond. For example, for entries 2–3 with CC monosubstitution, adding more alky groups on the α-carbon of the CC resulted in slightly lower TOF values. However, when it becomes a disubstitution on CC (entries 4–5), TOFs were lowered to ca. 1000 mol product (mol Pd × h)−1. In particular, when it is a tri-substitution (entry 6), the TOF was significantly reduced to only 110 ± 11 mol product (mol Pd × h)−1. Compared to allyl alcohol, these decreases in TOFs can be attributed to the larger steric hindrance that lower the reaction rate of Pd-H coordinating with CC bond. It can also be caused by the lower solubility and diffusion rate of longer and more branched alky chains in water. Besides olefinic alcohols, Pd NPs also showed good activity for catalyzing unsaturated carboxylic acid and amides when it is a CC mono-substitution, as demonstrated in entries 7−9."
12,Insights from MD simulations into the enhanced catalytic activity with TMVCP-Pd NPs,"3.4 Insights from MD simulations into the enhanced catalytic activity with TMVCP-Pd NPs Based on the results discussed above, we have shown that the TMVCP enables formation of green MNPs that are highly active towards 4-NP reduction and olefinic alcohol hydrogenation. The enhanced performance is likely related to the protein ligand effect. To get a clearer picture of the protein structure-function relationship, we used TMVCP-Pd NP for further theoretical analysis. It has been demonstrated by Knecht’s group that the reaction rate of allyl alcohol hydrogenation is proportional to the available surface area on the Pd NP surface [76]. Building on this insight we hypothesized that proteins surrounding the Pd NP do not significantly restrict access of solvent and small solutes to the surface. We tested this idea using an atomistic molecular dynamics simulation as computational microscope. For technical details please see the Experimental Section. Our initial simulations of the Pd NP surrounded by six protein subunits in water lead to two important observations: 1) The TMVCPs form stable complexes with the Pd NP through direct interaction with only a handful of residues; whereas the rest of the protein remain unchanged, which is likely the reason for the little conformation change after binding as shown in the previous CD results. The small ‘footprint’ of the contact is demonstrated in Fig. 5 a with the protein residues within 0.6 nm of the NP highlighted in blue. 2) The proteins maintain rather rigid and bulky conformations during the simulation and as a consequence, steric conflicts make dense packing impossible. Fig. 5b provides the evidence of conformational stability for a representative protein by tracking its radius of gyration throughout the simulation. These preliminary observations set the stage for addressing the main question we posed to our simulation: To what extent do solute molecules have access to the surface of the nanoparticles? In order to answer this question, we added propanol to our simulation box and quantified its accumulation at the surface of the nanoparticles. Since we were not interested in concentration dependent effects, we used solute concentration a bit higher than the experimental (0.0615 mmol/mL) and kept track of the solute within 0.6 nm from the surface of the NP. Fig. 5c shows an illustration of the NP surface covered with propanol molecules everywhere except the areas occupied by the protein (an animation of the propanol absorption onto Pd surface was provided in Movie S1). The number of propanols at the surface as a function of time is depicted in Fig. 5d. Starting from the initial condition with propanols randomly distributed throughout the simulation box, the number of propanols at the surface grows steadily until it settles into a stable plateau fluctuating between 100 and 120 molecules on the Pd NP with an average of 110 propanols on the surface (averaged over the stable plateau region). This number is in a quantitative agreement with the theoretically expected 107 ± 4 propanols at the surface of the Pd NP. The theoretical value was obtained by rearranging the formula [76]: T O F = C × N s o l u t e N N P where the C is the dimensionless constant (chose as C = 90000) [76], NNP is the number of Pd atoms in one particle, and TOF is taken from the experimental value for allyl alcohol hydrogenation (6382 ± 258 mol product (mol Pd × h)−1). Overall, the simulation results suggested that there are only a few protein residues having direct contact with the Pd NP, and the bulk protein subunits have minimal surface passivation which allows efficient access for small reactant molecules. Since A-protein is often a mixture of monomers and oligomers, it is also possible that the bulkier oligomers would bring more steric hindrance to make the NP surface even less passivated."
13,Conclusions,"TMVCP was successfully employed as a biological scaffold for the fabrication of green catalysts under environmentally benign conditions. The as prepared bio-nanocomposites demonstrated exceptional performance towards heterogeneous catalysis for 4-nitrophenol reduction and olefinic alcohol hydrogenation. To interpretate the improved catalytic activity, experiments and computational modelling with TMVCP-Pd NP were combined to reveal the structure/function relationship. We demonstrate that due to the moderate interaction of the protein-metal and the bulkiness of protein ligands, the Pd nanoparticle surface is minimally passivated while maintaining good colloid stability. The nanoparticle exposes a sufficient number of catalytically active sites for adsorption of small reactant molecules to initiate subsequent transformation to products. The results are important as this strategy combines eco-friendly synthesis with unique biomolecule binding properties to enlarge nanometal’s available surface area for approach of reactant molecules. We anticipate that this study will bring new opportunities for the rational design and applications of bioinspired in heterogeneous catalysis and other related fields."
