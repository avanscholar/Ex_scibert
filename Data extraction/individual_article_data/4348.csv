0,Introduction,"Large amounts of fossil fuels are consumed annually by on-road transport [1], and alternative fuels such as bio-diesel, bio-alcohol and hydrogen are attracting much attention for internal combustion (IC) engine applications. Alternative fuel applications can significantly alleviate the burdens of fossil fuels, and are effective to achieve low emissions for on-road vehicle [2]. Among the alternative fuels, hydrogen is considered to be an ultimate energy carrier, attributing to no carbon dioxide (CO2) emission during combustion and the highest energy density by mass among chemical fuels [3]. CO2 emission from fossil fuel combustion has caused serious problems of global warming, and the situation is becoming worse and worse [4]. Hydrogen applications are an effective method to decrease CO2 emission from IC engines. It was demonstrated by assessing well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions from a vehicle fuelled with bioethanol, gasoline and hydrogen that CO2 emission reduction and fuel economy were benefited from hydrogen additions significantly [5]. In addition, hybrid vehicle technology is effective to decrease hazardous substances [6], especially over cold start situations where catalyst temperature was low [7]. IC engines, as the power sources of hybrid vehicles, should have high power density, high thermal efficiency, and small size [8] to achieve low fuel consumption and allows an excellent layout strategy. Although most of IC engines equipped on modern hybrid vehicles are four-stroke reciprocating engines, Wankel engines [9] and opposed rotary piston (ORP) engines [10] are paid attention to, due to their high power density and compact designs. Combinations of hydrogen fuel and high power density engines (Wankel and ORP engines) will significantly promote the further development of hybrid vehicles, contributing to easing issues of global warming and environmental pollution. Two-stroke reciprocating engines also own high power density, but they have lower brake thermal efficiency [11] and higher exhaust emission factors [12] than other types of IC engines due to their structures. White et al. [13] reviewed hydrogen fuelled IC engines from technical perspectives. It was concluded that power losses of port fuel injection engines were significant for hydrogen fuelled IC engines due to low volumetric efficiency and low fuel mass fraction; additionally, more pre-ignition combustion events occurred compared to gasoline fuelled engines. Pressure boosting was recommended to recover the power outputs of hydrogen IC engines. White et al. [13] also pointed out the necessity for future fundamental researches decreasing NO x emissions. Hydrogen combustion temperature was much higher than that of fossil fuels, resulting in to more NO x formations [14]. Hydrogen was also used as additions in other fuels to promote in-cylinder combustion, achieving high thermal efficiency [15]. Wang et al. [16] demonstrated a drop of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions by hydrogen additions based on a gasoline engine, which was also observed by Raju et al. [17] based on a hydrogen enriched waste cooking oil engine. Koten [18] indicated the improvements of brake thermal efficiency in a reciprocating engine reached 20% over the given engine operation conditions by hydrogen additions. Wankel engines also benefited much from hydrogen additions, as demonstrated by Su et al. [19] that hydrogen additions effectively dropped the amount of unburned fuel in narrow and long combustion chambers. Meantime, hydrogen additions improved the cold start performance [20] and extended lean-burn limits [21]. An increase of brake thermal efficiency was also observed in Wankel engines when different fuels were blended with hydrogen [22]. Shi et al. [23] investigated the effects of split direct injection strategies on combustion and emissions characteristics of a hydrogen fuelled Wankel engine, indicating a wide second injection significantly increased the thermal efficiency. Many researches have been done for hydrogen applications to reciprocating engines and Wankel engines; however, investigations of ORP engines fuelled with hydrogen are at an initial stage that only preliminary researches are available [24]. ORP engines are free of connecting rod mechanisms, and operate smoothly. Operation theory of ORP engines was analyzed using mathematical equations, and the power output was estimated based on energy balance [25]. In addition, the conclusions were also drawn that the power output increased with piston number if the engine size was kept the same [26]. However, volumetric efficiency and combustion efficiency were neglected because more pistons would lead to less time for gas exchange and fuel combustion, resulting in lower engine thermal efficiency and power output. Gao et al. [27] analyzed intake and exhaust characteristics of a four-cylinder ORP engine using a 3D simulation approach, and pumping losses in the intake process were calculated. Pumping losses of this ORP engine were higher than conventional reciprocating engines, resulting from a short cyclic period in time and without overlaps of intake and exhaust ports opening [27]. Finally, power density of this gasoline ORP engine was estimated using 1D simulation that the value reached up to 80 kW/L over naturally aspirated conditions under 5000 RPM engine speed [10]. However, combustion process was not included in the 3D simulation model, and the engine was simplified as a four-stroke reciprocating engine with the cyclic period of 360° crank angle (CA) in the 1D simulation, which led to a low precision for engine performance estimations. Cyclic period of the four-cylinder ORP engines was half of the four-stroke reciprocating engines. Such that hydrogen or hydrogen blended fuels would fully presented the merits of ORP engines due to their high flame propagation speed which could ensure complete combustion [28]. Frequent backfire could occur in port fuel injection (PFI) hydrogen IC engines when the equivalence ratio of hydrogen/air mixture was larger than 0.56 [29]. Narrowed overlap angles of intake and exhaust valve opening reduced backflow of high temperature exhaust, further dropping the possibility of backfire [30]. For the ORP engines, there weren’t overlaps for intake and exhaust port opening during operations, so it had a low possibility of backfire than reciprocating engines. In the real-world driving, most of the engine operation points are located in part load regions, especially for urban driving [31]. Performances of reciprocating engines [32] and Wankel engines [33] fuelled with hydrogen or hydrogen blends were explored. A significant reduction of NO x and soot emissions was observed at part loads for a given engine [34] when hydrogen energy additions were 30% of the total fuel energy, but NO x emissions increased over full load cases. Effect of the hydrogen additions on combustion and emission characteristics of a gasoline Wankel engine was also investigated at part loads and stoichiometric conditions [33]. In-cylinder combustion pressure and brake thermal efficiency increased with hydrogen additions; meantime, hydrocarbon (HC) emission was reduced by 44.8% when the hydrogen volume fraction was increased from 0% to 5.2%. Hydrogen additions in a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) engine were analyzed at part open throttle conditions [35]. The results were consistent with other researches that hydrogen additions extended lean-burn misfire limits, increased engine thermal efficiency, and decreased HC and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. In order to compensate the power loss caused by low hydrogen energy density by volume, a turbocharger system was used that the power density was much higher than turbocharged petrol engines [36]. Further, lean-burn technology was used to drop NO x emissions [24]. In summary, many researches have been done to investigate the hydrogen applications to IC engines. Merits of hydrogen and hydrogen additions for IC engine utilizations were demonstrated using both simulation and experimental results; in addition, measures had been taken to ease its disadvantages such as high NO x emission factors and backfire. However, these researches are focused on reciprocating engines and Wankel engines, few researches are available for ORP engine fuelled with hydrogen at part load conditions although ORP engines present significant advantages for hybrid vehicle applications. In this paper, a 3D numerical simulation approach was used to study the in-cylinder combustion, heat release rates, and NO x formations over part load conditions; then, indicated thermal efficiency and NO x emission factors were calculated to address the advantages of hydrogen fuelled ORP engines."
1,Materials and methods,"This section describes the scientific hypothesis, modelling goals, plans for the numerical simulation, and descriptions of the model."
2,Scientific hypothesis,"2.1 Scientific hypothesis As indicated by Wang et al. [37] that the reciprocating engine performance including power output, thermal efficiency, exhaust energy, and coolant energy changed significantly with engine loads. Regarding this ORP engine which has a shorter cyclic period in time, it allows less time for the heat transfer between combusted mixture and cylinder walls during combustion. It will lead to less heat loss in theory, conducing to increasing the thermal efficiency, which is similar to the approach of engine block insulation to improve engine performance. Due to less heat loss by cylinder walls, the in-cylinder temperature and pressure during combustion should be high, resulting in high exhaust temperature and discharge pressure which can increase the exhaust energy; additionally, high in-cylinder combustion temperature will cause more NO x formations."
3,Modelling goals,"2.2 Modelling goals In order to explore the performance of the hydrogen fuelled ORP engine over part load conditions, a 3D numerical simulation model including combustion and emission formation processes was used in this investigation. By the simulation of this hydrogen ORP engine under part load conditions, the overall performance of this hydrogen ORP will be analyzed in Section 3 of this paper. The performance of this hydrogen ORP engine will be compared with conventional reciprocating engines and Wankel engines (published data) to highlight the merits of this ORP engine to address its potential applications for hybrid electric vehicles and range extended electric vehicles. Section 3 is organized as the follows: Firstly, combustion characteristics were analyzed by discussing the in-cylinder pressure evolutions, heat release rates, combustion durations, and combustion efficiency; secondly, heat loss was mainly focused on the loss by cylinder walls, which was considered to be significantly different from reciprocating engines; further, NO x as the main emissions from hydrogen combustion were analyzed in detail. In the end of Section 3, the key performance indicators of the engine performance were discussed."
4,Plans for the numerical simulation,"2.3 Plans for the numerical simulation Regarding the real world driving of on-road vehicles, IC engines operated over part load conditions for most of the driving situations, especially for urban driving. Performance explorations of this ORP engine fuelled with hydrogen at part load conditions were necessary for addressing its potentials of vehicle applications. Table 1 shows the boundary conditions of the 3D numerical simulation for various cases. 1000 RPM, 3000 RPM, and 5000 RPM represented the low, medium, and high engine speed; additionally, the maximum engine power output was corresponding to 5000 RPM based on the previous research [38]. Meanwhile, the intake manifold pressure of 0.4 bar, 0.6 bar, and 0.8 bar corresponded to low, medium, and high engine load conditions. Due to the difference of cyclic period in time over various engine speed, the size of time step setting was different in order to ensure that the same time step corresponded to the same crank angle for different engine speed. The intake manifold pressure was the inlet pressure of the three intake pipes; additionally, hydrogen and air were fully mixed at the inlet of intake pipes."
5,Model descriptions,"2.4 Model descriptions Because this ORP engine is a new type of internal combustion engines, the configurations are described firstly; then, the numerical simulation model is described. 2.4.1 Configurations of the opposed rotary piston engine Due to high auto-ignition temperature (809 K) of air/hydrogen mixture, spark ignition method was applied to this ORP engine. This ORP engine was a four-stroke, four-cylinder engine, with a compression ratio of 9.73 and a displacement of 0.5468 L. It had two spark plugs, two shafts, three intake ports, and one exhaust port. The end faces of the pistons were in the shape of sector (Fig. 1 ). The outlet lines of the sector were major arc, with a diameter of 59.5 mm. Chord length of the major arc was 59.0 mm. Geometric angles between the two end faces in each piston were 56°. More details of this engine were presented in the authors’ previous work [27]. Combustion chamber walls of this ORP engine included shaft surfaces, inner surfaces of blocks, and end faces of pistons (including bowl surfaces). Layout of the spark plugs in engine blocks is shown in Fig. 1(a). Pistons 1 and 3 were oppositely jointed with shaft 1; pistons 2 and 4 were jointed with shaft 2. There were two bowls in each end face of pistons, and were symmetrically positioned. Existing of the bowls made it possible to adjust ignition timing in a large range. The rated power density of this ORP engine fuelled with gasoline was approximately 80 kW/L over 5000 RPM, being estimated using a 1D simulation model [10], which could significantly promote the applications to hybrid vehicles. Operations of this ORP engine included intake process, compression process, expansion process, and exhaust process, with each stroke lasting 90° crank angle (CA). Animations of the engine operation process are shown in Video 1 (this video only included one cylinder). The pistons passed the exhaust port and three intake ports sequentially, and at most two intake ports opened simultaneously. This ORP engine was free of connecting rod mechanisms, and operated smoothly. It had a low possibility of cylinder knock theoretically as well, due to the separations of combustion chambers and the exhaust port during combustion. Because hot points generated around the exhaust port were one of the main reasons contributing to cylinder knock. The layout of both spark plugs also decreased the flame propagation distance and duration compared to the central position, further increasing the percentage of constant volume combustion which contributed to high thermal efficiency. There were two top dead centres (TDCs) and two bottom dead centres (BDCs) in this ORP engine; they were defined as the positions where the cylinder volumes were corresponding to the minimum value and maximum value, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 . Crank angle in this paper was referred to the centre position of corresponding combustion chamber. “TDC 1” and “BDC 1” were 0° CA and 90° CA, respectively. Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.120003. The following is the supplementary data related to this article: Video 1 2 Video 1 2.4.2 Numerical simulation model descriptions Computational meshes of the simulation model are presented in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3(a) corresponded to the start of simulation, and sinusoidal rotation profiles were attached to both shafts [10]. The ignition of the air-hydrogen mixture was achieved by patching high temperature zones (2773 K) in the regions of spark plugs. In this research, the ignition timing (17° CA before TDC) setting was the same for all the given scenarios. The fluid domains included four cylinders, three intake pipes, two spark plugs, and one exhaust pipe. Table 2 shows the sensitivity analysis of mesh numbers (size) and calculation residuals. Grid number of 779324 and calculation residuals of 10−6 were chosen in this work. Minimum orthogonal, maximum ortho skew, and maximum aspect ratio of overall mesh quality were 0.337, 0.663, and 16.726, respectively. The details of the mesh number for each part of the engine are shown in Table 3 . The mesh number of each bowl was slightly different in order to improve the mesh quality; Table 3 only listed the mesh number of one bowl. In this paper, hexahedral meshes were applied to all the fluid domains. Since the combustion chamber volume changed with engine operations, dynamic meshes were adopted. FLUENT [39] codes were used to simulate the in-cylinder combustion in this ORP engine, and it was based on the finite element method. Renormalization group (RNG) k-epsilon model was chosen, which improved the accuracy of predicting rapidly strained flows and swirling flows. During the air/hydrogen combustion, only thermal NO x was formed due to a lack of carbon and nitrogen elements in hydrogen fuel. In FLUENT code, the combustion model is described in a similar form to the energy balance equation [40], as shown in Equation (1), (1) ∂ ∂ t ( ρ Y I ′ ) + ∂ ∂ x i ⋅ ( ρ u i → Y I ′ ) = − ∂ ∂ x i ⋅ J i ′ , i → + R i ′ + S i ′ Where, t is time; ρ is density; Y I ′ is local mass fraction of the species i; u i → is average velocity; J i ′ , i → is the diffusion flux of species i; R i ′ is production rates of species i; S i ′ is production increase of distributed phase. The turbulent flame speed closure is computed using a model for wrinkled and thickened flame fronts [41], as indicated in Equation (2). (2) U t = A ( u ′ ) 3 / 4 U l 1 / 2 α − 1 / 4 l t 1 / 4 = A u ′ ( T t T c ) 1 / 4 A is model constant; u ′ is root-mean-square velocity; U l is laminar flame speed; α is molecular heat transfer coefficient of unburnt mixture; l t is turbulence length scale; T t is turbulence time scale; T c is chemical time scale [42]. The laminar flame speed [43] is calculated using Equation (3), (3) U l = U l , r e f ( T u T u , r e f ) γ ( p u p u , r e f ) β U l , r e f is reference laminar flame speed; T u is the unburnt reactant temperature; p u is pressure ahead of the flame; T u , r e f is 298 K; p u , r e f is 1.0 bar γ and β are the functions of equivalence ratio ahead of the flame front."
6,Results and discussion,"This section presented 3D numerical simulation results of this hydrogen fuelled ORP engine over part load conditions. As few data was available for hydrogen fuelled ORP engines, the simulation and experimental results of reciprocating and Wankel engines from published work were used to compare with the authors’ results in discussions."
7,Combustion characteristics of the opposed rotary piston engine,"3.1 Combustion characteristics of the opposed rotary piston engine In-cylinder pressure evolutions and pressure increase rates over different engine speed are shown in Fig. 4 . Peak in-cylinder pressure was significantly dependent on the intake manifold pressure; however, the corresponding crank angle was almost the same over different intake manifold pressure for 1000 RPM and 3000 RPM, being around 10° CA after TDC; in addition, the crank angle was much earlier over intake manifold pressure of 0.4 bar than that of 0.6 bar and 0.8 bar under 5000 RPM. Due to the long cyclic period in time for 1000 RPM engine speed, peak in-cylinder pressure should be higher than that of the other two engine speed due to earlier start of combustion (10% mass burn fraction) theoretically; however, 3000 RPM presented the highest pressure among the given engine speed, which was mainly caused by the highest volumetric efficiency, as shown in Table S1. Volumetric efficiency increased with intake manifold pressure for 1000 RPM; it was almost kept the same for 3000 RPM; however, it decreased with intake manifold pressure for 5000 RPM. Similar to the authors’ results, peak in-cylinder pressure of a hydrogen fuelled reciprocating engine was significantly dependent on the engine load in the work [44], where the pressure almost linearly increased with engine load over medium engine speed [44]; additionally, corresponding crank angle changed slightly with engine load. The pressure was also greatly affected by the fuel types, as demonstrated by the engine fuelling gasoline, 2,5-dimethylfuran, 2-Methylfuran, and ethanol [45]. The pressure of a reciprocating engine fuelled with n-butanol decreased from approximately 15.0 bar–12.0 bar when the intake manifold pressure dropped from 0.5 bar to 0.3 bar [46] that the pressure was lower than the values of this hydrogen fuelled ORP engine. Additionally, the pressure of a fusel oil fuelled spark ignition engine under 50% engine load over 2200 RPM engine speed was twice higher than that of 25% load scenario [47]. Peak in-cylinder pressure increase with engine load was slowed down after the engine load was higher than 50% [47]. Meantime, the corresponding crank angle was retarded slightly with engine load over the given engine speed [47], which was inconsistent with the authors’ results. Regarding to a gasoline engine [48], the crank angle corresponding to the peak in-cylinder pressure changed slightly with the engine load, being around 15° CA after TDC over stoichiometric conditions. In-cylinder pressure increase rates showed similar tendency for all the given scenarios, with the peak value occurring around 10° CA before TDC. The peak was less obvious for lower intake manifold pressure scenarios. The minimum values of pressure increase rates were also relied on the intake manifold pressure, and their corresponding crank angle increased with engine speed slightly. The peak in-cylinder pressure increase rates of hydrogen fuelled ORP engine over 2000 RPM engine speed were the highest among the engine speed range of 1000 RPM∼5000 RPM [44]. The changes of maximum in-cylinder pressure increase rates with engine load were also significantly affected by the fuel types [47]. It was indicated by the work [47] that the changes of peak heat release rate with engine load was similar to that of peak in-cylinder pressure; however, the corresponding crank angle was advanced with engine load increase. Heat release rates of this hydrogen fuelled ORP engine over the given scenarios are shown in Fig. 5 . Heat release rates presented double-peak, with the first peak being around 5° CA after TDC and the second peak being later than 10° CA after TDC; additionally, the second peak was less obvious for lower intake manifold pressure cases. Similar to the in-cylinder pressure, the crank angle corresponding to peak heat release rate over 0.4 bar and 5000 RPM engine speed was much later than other cases. Late combustion of fuel/air mixture led to low in-cylinder pressure after TDC, resulting in low indicated thermal efficiency. Similar to the authors’ results, peak heat release rates over medium-high load was less sensitive than those of low engine load, as indicated in the work [44]. Peak heat release rates decreased dramatically with intake manifold pressure when the pressure was lower than 0.5 bar [46], which had good agreements with the authors’ results; and the corresponding crank angle changed slightly with intake manifold pressure [46]. Compared with the results from İlhak et al. [48] based on a gasoline engine, the crank angle corresponding to the peak heat release rates was advanced slightly by lowering the engine load. Heat of reactions could reflect the development of in-cylinder combustion to some extent. Distributions of heat of reactions in combustion chambers are shown in Fig. S1 that the combustion started from the bowls, and then developed into the gaps between the adjacent pistons after TDC. Start of combustion, combustion phasing, and combustion durations for the given scenarios are presented in Fig. 6 ; meantime, the residual mass fraction of hydrogen in combustion chambers are also shown in Fig. S2. In this paper, start of combustion (CA10) was defined as the crank angle corresponding to 10% mass burn fraction (MBF) of hydrogen; combustion phasing (CA50) corresponded to the position where MBF was 50%; combustion duration (CA10∼90) was the crank angle duration between 10% MBF and 90% MBF. These three key indexes significantly affected the engine performance, such as power output and indicated specific fuel consumption. The three indexes increased with intake manifold pressure over 1000 RPM, which meant a fast combustion over low intake manifold pressure; however, it changed slightly for 3000 RPM. It was mainly caused by hydrogen/air temperature before ignition because hydrogen combustion was very sensitive to mixture temperature, as demonstrated by Konnov et al. [49] and Hu et al. [50]. The hydrogen/air temperature before ignition was resulted from the joint effects of heat transfer and mixture quantity. Lower intake manifold pressure led to less hydrogen/air mixture, resulting in more effects from heat transfer between cylinder walls and mixture; however, lower quantity of mixture would cause lower temperature increase due to compression effects. Additionally, it was also partly affected by the amount of heat release at the start of combustion. The in-cylinder temperature evolutions of the given scenarios are shown in Fig. 10, which was consistent with the start of combustion. Hydrogen mass fraction distributions in combustion chambers are presented in Fig. 7 . The distributions agreed with that of heat of reactions that hydrogen was mainly concentrated in the corners and the top regions of cylinders at the end of the combustion process. The ignition timing of these scenarios was the same, being 17° CA before TDC. In reality, optimal ignition timing changed with engine speed and load, which would be explored in the authors’ future work. Combustion efficiency of these scenarios is shown in Fig. 8 , and the efficiency were larger than 99.5% which was much higher than reciprocating engines fuelled with gasoline, ethanol, and methanol [51], benefited from high flame propagation speed, short quenching distance, and low lean-burn limit. As indicated in Fig. 8, the effect of intake manifold pressure on combustion efficiency was inconsistent over the three engine speed. Higher intake manifold pressure contributed to lower combustion efficiency for 1000 RPM; however, it was inverse for 3000 RPM and 5000 RPM. Moreover, combustion efficiency over 5000 RPM was more dependent on the intake manifold pressure than the other two engine speed. It was mainly caused by the in-cylinder temperature when hydrogen/air mixture was ignited. Streamlines in the combustion chambers are also presented in Fig. S5. Some vortexes were formed in the bowls over low and medium engine speed during combustion. P-V diagrams during engine operations could reflect the engine performance to some extent, and could be used to analyze the energy losses. P-V diagrams of the given scenarios are presented in Fig. 9 . The effect of engine speed on in-cylinder pressure evolutions was inconsistent for different scenarios. The peak in-cylinder pressure of a gasoline and propane fuelled engine decreased continuously with engine speed [52]; however, the pressure was the maximum over 3000 RPM for engine fuelling with gasoline and gasoline/ethanol blends [53]; and it was around 2500 RPM for a hydrogen engine over the intake pressure of 0.9 bar [44]. In-cylinder pressure evolutions were determined by volumetric efficiency and combustion characteristics. Regarding the intake pressure of 0.8 bar, the peak in-cylinder pressure was the maximum over 3000 RPM due to high volumetric efficiency and short combustion durations. In-cylinder pressure decreased immediately after TDC for the intake manifold pressure of 0.4 bar over 5000 RPM engine speed; the in-cylinder pressure continued to increase at the start of power stroke for other cases, which contributed to higher indicated thermal efficiency. In-cylinder pressure at the end of power stroke was significantly relied on the intake manifold pressure that it decreased from approximately 5.0 bar–2.0 bar when the intake manifold pressure dropped from 0.8 bar to 0.4 bar. Higher pressure at the end of power stroke would result in higher pumping losses in the free discharge process."
8,Heat loss analysis by cylinder walls,"3.2 Heat loss analysis by cylinder walls Combustion durations of a reciprocating engine fuelled with hydrogen changed slightly with engine load over medium engine speed [44], which agreed with the authors’ results. Combustion duration of a gasoline Wankle engine under the intake manifold pressure of 0.375 bar and 3000 RPM was approximately 67.8 CA, which was much longer than that of hydrogen fuelled ORP engine. Short combustion duration was mainly benefited from high hydrogen flame propagation speed [54]. Combustion durations decreased significantly with the hydrogen additions, resulting from the enhanced in-cylinder combustion by hydrogen [33]. Combustion durations of the engine fuelled with 2,5-dimethylfur, ethanol, and gasoline almost linearly increased with the drop of engine load [55], which was different from hydrogen fuelled engines. The effect of engine load on the performance of a compressed natural gas (CNG) engine was also affected by excess ratio, as demonstrated by Ha et al. [56]. Combustion duration of the CNG engine over 25% engine load was longer than that of 50% engine load when the excess ratio was 1.4; however, it was inverse when the excess ratio was 1.2 [56]. Higher in-cylinder temperature when the hydrogen/air mixture was ignited led more hydrogen/air to be burned before TDC, resulting in higher peak in-cylinder temperature, as shown by 1000 RPM cases in Fig. 10. Temperature difference before ignition presented a small difference over the cases of 3000 RPM, which may lead to a minor difference of the three indexes in Fig. 6. Due to the pure hydrogen combustion of this ORP engine, the peak in-cylinder temperature was higher than that of hydrogen-enriched [57] and non-hydrogen fuel [58] combustion under similar operation conditions. The maximum in-cylinder temperature of a gasoline engine was lower than 2100 K over the engine speed of 1500 RPM and intake pressure of approximately 0.7 bar [59]. The crank angle corresponding to the peak in-cylinder temperature was around 20° CA after TDC, which was consistent with the results from Sakai and Rothamer [60]. Heat transfer between hydrogen/air mixture and cylinder walls significantly affected the mixture temperature before ignition, further influencing the in-cylinder combustion. Heat radiation was not considered in the simulation model, which could lead to less heat losses in this work than those of real situations. As can be seen, the peak values of heat loss rates increased enormously with engine speed, and the corresponding crank angle was slightly advanced by high engine speed, as indicated in Fig. 11 . Due to the short cyclic period in time for this ORP engine, accumulated heat losses during combustion process should be lower than reciprocating and Wankel engines over the same engine speed and fuel types. On the other hand, the ignition design (ORP engines) conduced to the heat transfer between cylinder walls and combusted mixture. Because the combustion started from the bowls that high temperature zones were always surrounded by cylinder walls (see Fig. 12 ). However, the spark plugs were located in the middle of the cylinder head for reciprocating engines, and the flame propagated from the spark plugs to other regions. At the first half of combustion process, combusted mixture (high temperature) did not contact with cylinder walls, which decreased the heat losses in theory for reciprocating engines. So, the heat losses were joint results of the mentioned points. The crank angle corresponding to the peak heat loss rates were not consistent with maximum surface area of cylinder walls, because the heat loss rates were the combined results of temperature and contact area."
9,NO x emission characteristics of the opposed rotary piston engine,"3.3 NO x emission characteristics of the opposed rotary piston engine Due to higher combustion temperature of hydrogen/air mixture, it usually led to more NO x formations compared with other fuels [61], such as gasoline [62]. NO dominated NO x emissions during the stoichiometric hydrogen/air mixture combustion. Fig. 13 shows NO x concentration during combustion. NO x formation over 1000 RPM was less dependent on the intake manifold pressure than 3000 RPM and 5000 RPM. Additionally, NO x emission under 0.6 bar presented the highest concentration among 1000 RPM scenarios; however, it increased with intake manifold pressure for the other two engine speed cases. It was mainly caused by in-cylinder combustion temperature, as presented in Fig. 10. Due to longer high temperature duration, more NO x was formed later than 15° CA after TDC over 0.8 bar than that of 0.4 bar and 0.6 bar over 1000 RPM. For the given intake manifold pressure, NO x emissions decreased with engine speed. The effect of engine speed on NO x emissions was inconsistent for published work. For example, the maximum NO x concentration of a hydrogen engine corresponded to 2500 RPM [44]; however, NO x concentration increased continuously with engine speed for a gasoline engine [52]. NO x formation included thermal NO x , prompt NO x , and fuel NO x . Prompt NO x were formed in hydrocarbon flame over fuel-rich conditions, and the formation rates were much higher than thermal NO x . During hydrogen combustion, NO x formation was determined by thermal NO x which were related to the combustion temperature and high temperature durations (time period). Higher engine speed provided shorter durations for NO x formation, leading to the NO x concentration drop with increasing engine speed. Fig. S6 shows accumulated NO x formation during combustion process that the accumulated NO x increased with intake manifold pressure over the given engine speed. The accumulated NO x were consistent with that of NO x concentration in Fig. 13 that accumulated NO x decreased slightly after reaching the peak value. Luo et al. [44] indicated that NO x concentration of a hydrogen fuelled reciprocating engine decreased significantly when the engine load decreased from 75% to 25% over medium engine speed, which was consistent with the authors’ results in Fig. 13. It was mainly caused by the drop of combustion temperature due to less hydrogen/air mixture. NO x concentration of this hydrogen fuelled ORP engine was much higher than reciprocating engines fuelled with methanol, comparing with the experimental results from Gong et al. [63]. NO x concentration of reciprocating engines fuelled with gasoline and n-butanol depended more on the engine load than this hydrogen fuelled ORP engine. NO x concentration almost linearly decreased with the drop of brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) over 1500 RPM engine speed conditions [64]. NO x mass fraction distributions in combustion chambers are shown in Fig. 14 . As can be seen, less NO x was distributed on the top regions of the cylinders; the NO x concentration in the bowls was much higher than other regions at the start of power stroke."
10,Performance evaluations,"3.4 Performance evaluations Overall performance of this hydrogen fuelled ORP engine is shown in Fig. 15 , including indicated power output, indicated NO x emission factors, heat loss percentage in fuel chemical energy, exhaust energy percentage in fuel chemical energy, and indicated thermal efficiency. Indicated power output almost linearly increased with intake manifold pressure; and 5000 RPM engine speed presented more dependency on the intake manifold pressure. Indicated NO x emission factors increased with intake manifold pressure for 3000 RPM and 5000 RPM; however, they increased slightly and then decreased with intake manifold pressure for 1000 RPM. It was resulted from in-cylinder combustion temperature (see Fig. 10) which was consistent with NO x emission factors. In the authors’ previous work [42], lean-burn technology was applied to this hydrogen fuelled ORP engine to decrease NO x formation. As an important factor leading to low thermal efficiency, heat losses by cylinder walls were higher than 7.5% for all the given scenarios, as shown in Fig. 15(c). Heat losses were joint effect from burned gas temperature (close to cylinder walls) and cyclic period in time. Intake manifold pressure showed the most significant impact on the heat loss percentage for 1000 RPM due to high in-cylinder temperature and long cyclic period in time. Heat loss percentage by cylinder walls for 1000 RPM was much higher than that of 3000 RPM and 5000 RPM, which was mainly caused by longer cyclic period in time for 1000 RPM. The percentage was much smaller than those of reciprocating engines due to short cyclic period in time, as demonstrated by comparing the authors’ results with the published data [65]. The drop of heat losses in internal combustion engines could improve the brake thermal efficiency; the theory was similar to adiabatic engines [66] which were widely investigated to decrease the heat losses. Compared with gasoline engines, the energy loss by exhaust was much higher for this hydrogen fuelled ORP engine over part load conditions [67]. Large amounts of heat energy were wasted through exhaust which accounted for 17%∼30% of fuel chemical energy for a gasoline engine [67], 24%∼34% for a diesel engine [68], and 22%∼37% for a natural gas engine [69] under the given scenarios. Since hydrogen combustion led to high in-cylinder temperature, much heat was contained in the exhaust for hydrogen internal combustion engines. The percentage of exhaust energy in fuel chemical energy was higher than 50% for the nine scenarios; 5000 RPM engine speed presented the most energy losses by exhaust among the given engine speed. The percentage increased with intake manifold pressure for 1000 RPM engine speed, and it had an inverse tendency for 3000 RPM and 5000 RPM. Indicated thermal efficiency over 5000 RPM decreased from approximately 30%–22% with the drop of intake manifold pressure, which was much lower than that of 1000 RPM and 3000 RPM. The efficiency dropped sharply when the intake manifold pressure was lower than 0.6 bar for 5000 RPM, which was mainly caused by long combustion durations (see Fig. 6). For high engine speed conditions, ignition timing should be advanced, which could greatly improve the indicated thermal efficiency. Indicated thermal efficiency over 1000 RPM and 3000 RPM was larger than 30%, which was at the similar level with published data [70]. Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) over low load conditions was more sensitive to intake manifold pressure than that of high load conditions, as demonstrated by Qi et al. [64] that BTE decreased dramatically when brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) was lower than 3.0 bar. BTE of a spark ignition engine fuelled with ethanol-gasoline blends increased with throttle opening; meantime, the increase was higher for higher ethanol ratio scenarios; additionally, the increase was more sensitive to throttle opening for lower engine load conditions [71]. It had good agreements with the authors’ simulation results."
11,Conclusion,"High power density and compact designs make the ORP engines as ideal power sources of hybrid vehicles. In this paper, engine performance of the ORP engine fuelled with hydrogen was investigated over part load conditions. The main conclusions were as the follows: 1. Peak in-cylinder pressure was greatly relied on the intake manifold pressure that the value decreased approximately 50% when the intake manifold pressure dropped from 0.8 bar to 0.4 bar; the corresponding crank angle was almost the same for the given scenarios except for 5000 RPM, intake manifold pressure of 0.4 bar. Peak in-cylinder pressure increase rates presented similar tendency for all the given cases. 2. Heat release rates were quite low before TDC, then they reached the peak value around 5° CA after TDC except for 5000 RPM and intake manifold pressure of 0.4 bar case where the crank angle corresponded to approximately 11° CA after TDC. The peak heat release rates dropped from approximately 15 J/(°CA) to 6 J/(°CA) when the intake manifold pressure decreased from 0.8 bar to 0.4 bar over 5000 RPM. 3. The changes of combustion durations with intake manifold pressure were different for the three engine speed, which was mainly caused by hydrogen/air mixture temperature before ignition. The combustion durations increased significantly with intake manifold pressure for 1000 RPM engine speed; however, the intake manifold pressure presented little effect on the combustion durations for 3000 RPM. 4. Peak in-cylinder temperature was higher than 2000 K for all the given scenarios, and it increased with intake manifold pressure for 3000 RPM and 5000 RPM; however, the case of 0.6 bar was slightly higher than that of 0.4 bar and 0.8 bar over 1000 RPM. Additionally, the positions of the maximum heat loss rates through cylinder walls were inconsistent with those of maximum in-cylinder temperature. NO x concentration during hydrogen combustion agreed with in-cylinder temperature. 5. NO x emission factors were in the range of 9 g/(kW·h)∼10 g/(kW·h) for 1000 RPM engine speed, and they changed slightly with intake manifold pressure; NO x emission factors almost linearly increased with intake manifold pressure for 3000 RPM and 5000 RPM. The percentage of heat losses in fuel chemical energy decreased with intake manifold pressure; and it depended more on the intake manifold pressure for low engine speed cases. Indicated thermal efficiency could be improved by advanced ignition timing, especially for high engine speed conditions."
