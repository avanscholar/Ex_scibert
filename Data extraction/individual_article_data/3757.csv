0,Introduction,"Biodiesel as a fuel component can be mixed in any ratio with standard diesel for use in the diesel engines, and biodiesel production has attracted considerable attention worldwide as an alternative energy source to replace traditional petroleum diesel product because of its environmental benefits and nearly neutral CO2 emissions [1,2]. During the production of biodiesel, the transesterification converts approximately 10% of the total mass of triacylglycerol to glycerol using vegetable oils or animal fats with alcohols [3]. Recently, glycerol as a potential feedstock by catalytic steam reforming to produce hydrogen gas has received considerable research attention. A few studies have been carried out on glycerol steam reforming by the different metal catalysts including Ni, Ir, Rh, Ru, Co, Pt, Ce and Pd based catalysts [4–12]. For example, Nichele et al. studied Ni supported catalysts for hydrogen production by glycerol steam reforming, and the effects of the supports including TiO2, SBA-15 and ZrO2 on the performances of catalysts were evaluated [4]. Some studies showed that Co/Al2O3, Rh/Al2O3 and Ru/Y2O3 catalysts exhibited high H2 selectivity and glycerol conversion, and the reaction process was negatively affected by coke formation [5–7]. Up until now, it is assumed that catalytic activity remains stable throughout the catalyst life in designing catalytic steam reforming reactors for hydrogen production. However, the formation of carbon residues in steam reforming reaction of glycerol is also inevitable. Carbons formed tend to deposit and cover the active sites of catalyst surface, which may lead the catalyst to lose its activity with the passage of time. Thus, a quantitative description and kinetic study of catalytic activity of catalyst, for the purpose of optimizing the design and operation of H2 production process from glycerol steam reforming, are essential. These form the main motivation of carrying this study on the use of a synthesized Ni–Cu–Al catalyst with low-cost to investigate the feasibility of steam reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production. The Ni–Cu–Al catalyst was prepared by the co-precipitation method with rising pH technique. To obtain a better understanding of catalyst behaviors, the modeling of catalytic activity was carried out based on the catalyst deactivation model and reforming reaction rate law. A fixed-bed reactor in a temperature-controlled oven was employed under atmospheric pressure within a temperature range of 500–600°C [13,14]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The Ni–Cu–Al catalyst was prepared by the co-precipitation with rising pH technique according to the method reported by Wu and Williams [15–17]. Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O, Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O and Cu(NO3)2⋅6H2O with above 98% purity were used for the catalysts preparation and purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Shanghai Trading Co. Ltd. 1M NH4OH was added to an aqueous solution (300mL) containing Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O and Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O with the addition of Cu(NO3)2⋅6H2O. The precipitation was carried out at 50°C with moderate stirring until the final pH of 8.5 was achieved. The pH measurements were carried out by pH meter. The precipitate was filtered then washed by 50°C deionized water, followed by being dried at 110°C over 15h. And finally, it was calcined under air atmosphere at a low heating rate of 5°Cmin−1 until the final calcination temperature of 650°C was achieved and maintained for over 3h. The catalyst used in the experiments was crushed and sieved to granules with a size range between 0.20 and 0.45mm. In these conditions, the possible reactions may be as follows: (R1) Ni 2 + + 2 NH 4 OH = Ni ( OH ) 2 ↓ + 2 NH 4 + (R2) Al 3 + + 3 NH 4 OH = Al ( OH ) 3 ↓ + 3 NH 4 + (R3) Cu 2 + + 2 NH 4 OH = Cu ( OH ) 2 ↓ + 2 NH 4 + If the excess NH4OH solution was added, [Ni(NH3)6]2+ and [Cu(NH3)4]2+ were produced: (R4) Ni ( OH ) 2 + 6 NH 4 OH = [ Ni ( NH 3 ) 6 ] 2 + + 2 OH - + 6 H 2 O (R5) Cu ( OH ) 2 + 4 NH 4 OH = [ Cu ( NH 3 ) 4 ] 2 + + 2 OH - + 6 H 2 O Though the Ni and/or Cu deposits in the precipitates can be oxidized to NiO and CuO in the stage of air calcination, liquid ammonia was controlled carefully to add to the solutions by rising pH value (pH<8.5)."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts The synthesized catalyst was characterized and tested using different techniques. The specific surface area was determined with the Brenauer–Emmett–Teller (N2-BET) adsorption method using a Micrometric Acusorb 2100E apparatus. Crystal structure of catalyst was determined by X-ray powder diffraction spectra performed using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 powder diffractometer, where a Cu target Kα-ray (operating at 40kV and 30mA) was used as the X-ray source. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (LEO 1530) was used to study the surface morphology of the fresh and spent catalysts. The morphology of the prepared catalyst and consumed catalyst were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai G220 S-Twin). For the TEM analysis, the samples were ground and dispersed with ethanol, and deposited on a Cu grid covered with a perforated carbon membrane. The chemical composition in the catalyst was determined by the elemental analysis method. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the used catalyst using a Stanton–Redcroft thermogravimetric analyzer was carried out at a heating rate of 15°Cmin−1 to 700°C with a dwell time of 10min under a flow of air with the flow rate of 100mlmin−1."
4,Catalyst activity measurements,"2.3 Catalyst activity measurements Details of the laboratory system used for the catalytic activity measurements in steam reforming of glycerol to hydrogen production were described in the previous papers [18,19]. The vaporizer in the reactor consists of electrically heated tube packed with quartz wool. Reagent-grade glycerol, with a purity of 99.5%, was purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Chemical Co., Ltd. The mixture of pure water and glycerol can be injected to the vaporizer housed in the reactor by an injector of ID of 1×10−3 m. A reactant mixture of glycerol and water, with a steam to carbon (S/C) ratio of 3 (molar ratio of glycerol/water=1/9), was injected into a vaporizer (the temperature of the vaporizer is controlled over at 300°C) using a syringe infusion pump with the feeding rate of 4ml/hr. The reactant vapors were diluted with N2 gas in the vaporizer, and then fed into the catalyst bed. The nitrogen served as a carrier gas was also aided in the elemental balance analysis. The nitrogen flow in a typical experiment was adjusted to 3×10−3 m3 min−1. A sample of 1.0g catalyst supported by quartz wool was loaded into the center of reactor. K-type thermocouple was used to measure the catalyst bed temperature. Condensable compositions in a product gas were removed through a refrigerated coil. The product gas was collected in the sample bag and analyzed by a off-line gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with two columns connected in series (MS and Poraplot Q) with thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors (TCD–FID), and the GC was properly calibrated for the detection of CH4, CO, CO2, and H2 before the experiments. The experimental data were taken after the steady state reached which took approximately 0.5h after the feed flow was started. The calculation of glycerol conversion (x glycerol) for the experiments is based on carbon molar outflow of the gas products and the glycerol molar inflow of the reactor [13,14], n and y are the relevant molar flows (molmin−1) and gas molar fractions respectively, and ndry , out is the dry total molar flow of gas products leaving the reactor, yc , out is the total carbon molar fraction for outlet: (1) X = c 0 - c c 0 = n dry , out ∑ y c , out 3 n glycerol , in The calculation of conversion of steam can be given [13,14]: (2) X H 2 O = n dry , out ( y H 2 + 2 y CH 4 ) - 4 x glycerol n glycerol , in n H 2 O, in H2 selectivity can be defined and calculated by [13,14]: (3) H 2 , Sel = 2 n H 2 , out 2 ( n H 2 O, in - n H 2 O, out ) + x glycerol × 8 n glycerol , in where c and c 0 shown as subscript are outlet and inlet glycerol concentrations, mol/m3. A non-stoichiometric thermodynamic code on the chemical equilibrium based on the minimization of Gibbs free energy was used to calculate the H2 production from glycerol steam reforming. Four atoms, C, H, O, N, and seven compounds, C3H8O3, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, N2, are considered in the equilibrium system. The equations were solved by using an in-house Fortran Code based on the DNEQNF subroutine (DNEQNF solves nonlinear equations using a modified Powell hybrid algorithm and a finite difference approximation to the Jacobian (30)) of the IMSL® library. The details on thermodynamic analysis for glycerol steam reforming have been described in previous paper [20]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction pattern of catalyst calcined at 650°C is shown in Fig. 1 and it can be found that all the metals in the fresh catalyst remained in oxide forms. Some peaks of 37.32°, 43.30° and 62.91° attributed to the presence of cubic NiO in catalyst and intense peaks at 67.00°, 45.50° and 37.59° correspond to γ-Al2O3. Some peaks of 32.42°, 38.83°, 48.73°, 53.60°, and 58.41° can be assigned to CuO. No spinel-like compounds were detected for the catalyst because this phase can be poorly crystallized due to the calcination of the co-precipitate at 650°C. The NiO/Al2O3 catalyst calcined only at above 700°C could bring spinel composition of NiAl2O4. The presence of CuO in Ni–Al oxides may enhance the thermal stability of the catalyst. The elemental analysis and calculation showed the catalyst contains NiO of 29.2wt%, CuO of 31.1wt%, and Al2O3 of 39.7wt%. The specific surface area of fresh catalyst by BET method was measured as 34.821m2/g [18]."
7,Glycerol steam reforming,"3.2 Glycerol steam reforming As shown in Fig. 2 , the H2 product and glycerol conversion in glycerol steam reforming by the catalyst show the improvements with increasing temperatures. The products analysis of glycerol steam reforming indicates that H2, CO2, CO and CH4 are major gaseous products. In all cases, the formation of CH4 is considerably low during the whole test. There are two main reactions which can take place in a high temperature with steam/fuel mixture: steam reforming and decomposition. The reactions occur simultaneously in the fixed-bed reactor including H2 production and other side reactions. The concentration of H2 produced from glycerol steam reforming and decomposition increases with increasing temperatures. The maximum conversion and product obtained from the experiments are limited to their thermodynamic equilibrium values. Fig. 2 also gives the values of thermodynamic calculation for glycerol steam reforming. The experimental glycerol conversions by the catalyst were obtained by collecting the data every 5min, then take average values of the initial 30min at each temperature. As results, the average conversions are 45.0%, 52.0%, and 71.9% at 500°C, 550°C and 600°C, respectively, whereas 85%, 96.5% and 98.2% equilibrium conversions are thermodynamically predicted at 500°C, 550°C and 600°C [14,20]. The thermodynamic values of glycerol conversion are much higher because the carbon formation was not in consideration in thermodynamic calculation using a non-stoichiometric methodology based on the minimization of Gibbs free energy. Besides, some compounds have previously been detected in glycerol steam reforming such as formaldehyde, methanol, ethylene, ethane, acetaldehyde, ethanol, propane, propene, propanol and acetone are all neglected, and only methyl group (CO, CO2, CH4) plus glycerol, steam and H2 were the compounds considered in the calculations [18]. The H2 concentration at 600°C was found to be 8.1vol%, which can be corresponded to the number of H2 moles to glycerol as 5.0. The thermodynamic molar number of hydrogen to glycerol is 5.7 at 600°C [20]. The difference between experimental and calculated equilibrium values is either due to catalyst effectiveness or reaction kinetics. The values of 22.0%, 26.1% and 24.9% in steam conversion in the experiment were found to be approaching the calculated equilibrium values of 24.8%, 24.6% and 24.8% at 500°C, 550°C, and 600°C [14,20]. In fact, there may be no significant influence of steam concentration on the reforming reaction rate because the S/C ratio of higher than 3.0 in the experiments was far more than the stoichiometric ratio of 1.0. Fig. 2(b) shows H2 selectivity at different temperatures. Hydrogen selectivity was found to be in the range of 61.0–78.6% at 500–600°C. It is obvious that the catalyst is not very active for H2 production from glycerol steam reforming at temperatures lower than 500°C. Fig. 3 shows the major gaseous products H2, CO2, CO and CH4 concentration (N2 as the carrier gas) and glycerol conversion (X) variations with time at 500°C, 550°C and 600°C. The great quantities of hydrogen and CO2 are produced at excess water at the three temperatures. As can be seen, H2 concentration and glycerol conversion decrease with time on stream at the three temperatures, which indicates that catalyst has a high initial activity to covert the glycerol, afterwards it undergoes a deactivation process. At 600°C, after 1.0h-on-stream, the glycerol conversion of less than 50% was observed while at 30min the value was up to 70%. The decreases in H2 production and glycerol conversion may be related to soiling and blocking of active sites as results of carbons deposits. The formation of CH4 is almost inhibited when the temperature is increasing from 500°C. The concentrations of CH4 and CO are small which may be attributed to the methane steam reaction and water gas shift reaction (WGS) to produce CO2 and H2. This indicates the catalyst synthesized has a sufficient capacity for reforming the produced CH4 into hydrogen, and also facilitates the WGS reaction to convert CO into CO2 providing additional H2 production. The calculated values of H2/CO2 increased slightly with time whereas the ratios of H2/CO and CO2/CO decreased. This is mainly due to the significant effect of catalyst presence, moreover, the reaction dominated the H2 and others products for glycerol reforming and decomposition. (R6) C 3 H 8 O 3 → H 2 O C x H y O z + gases ( CO 2 ,CO, H 2 , … ) + C ( s ) The ratio of CO2/CO was also decreased from 500°C to 600°C, which implies a water gas shift caused by an increase in CO formation with increasing temperature. CH4 formation in products is quite small and high temperature favors the CH4 reforming. The carbon formation and deposits from glycerol steam reforming are important, because they affect catalyst activity and also alter the product components. Carbons are typically the products of CO disproportionation and CH4 decomposition. The carbon deposits phenomenon could be observed in the reacted catalysts by SEM, which is particularly used for examination of catalyst surface texture and morphology, and details are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The catalysts before and after test both display as large particles in a state of aggregation with an irregular morphology. It can be observed from Fig. 4(a) that the fresh catalyst exhibits two kinds of morphologies: aggregates of μm size level and some small particles of less than 30nm. The presence of small particles is observed for NiO. And the NiO particles of less than 30nm are accumulated on the external surface of catalyst. Al2O3 can be observed as large particles, and the high CuO loading (>30wt%) in the prepared Ni–Cu–Al catalyst is the likely significant agglomeration of crystallites. CuO and Al2O3 may be segregated about ∼μm in the catalyst. It has been reported that the quantitative parameters of the reaction such as carbon capacity and macroscopic rate of carbon deposition may change significantly when copper was introduced to the catalyst [21]. The change of particle shape is determined by the type of the carbon deposit process which, in turn, depends on the surface structure of the original fresh metal particle. It can be observed from Fig. 4(b) that some of the catalyst particles are cracked and fragmented into small particles after the steam reforming process, filamentous carbons are observed on the cracked surface of the reacted catalyst. It appears that the Ni particles are sintered until the critical size that favors the formation of filamentous carbon is reached and it also suggested that no filaments would grow below a certain minimum filament diameter [22]. However, not all the catalyst particles with surface breakup are covered with filamentous carbons after the steam reforming process. Some tubular carbons are also observed on Ni–Cu–Al catalyst in Fig. 4(b). The fact of surface breakup observed after reaction suggests that a Ni-rich carbons zone is formed initially by carbon deposits on Ni particles during the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons, and then the release of dissolved carbons causes the lift-off of the Ni-rich carbon particles and resulted in surface breakup [15]. Mechanism schematic diagram of catalytic reaction and carbons deposits on the catalyst is showed in Fig. 5 . And the corresponding images of fresh and spent Ni–Cu–Al catalyst are shown in Fig. 6 . NiO particles with a diameter around 15–90nm was illustrated by the transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis of the fresh catalyst (Fig. 6(a)) and the presence of nickel and copper oxide particles (dark zones) over the mesoporous structure of Al2O3 support is visible in the TEM images. Some of them show an irregular shape that seems to adapt to the porous structure of the support and the other ones show a cubic shape probably placed over the external surface of the support. From the observation of Fig. 6(b), the carbons were deposited with various types, and metallic Ni is occupied at the tip or center of the filament carbons. It is also observed that the Ni metal occupied at the tip of the filament carbons has the average Ni metal particle size of around 10–30nm. The size of the deposited carbon is more or less depending on Ni metal occupied at the tip or inside the deposit carbon. Carbon removal from the catalyst was analyzed by TGA experiments during medium temperature oxidation of 400–700°C, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . The decrease of the mass should be due to the combustion of deposited carbons on the catalyst. As can be seen, thermogravimetric analysis patterns of Ni–Cu–Al catalyst demonstrate three phases in the carbons removal process. The ratio of total weight loss is about 38wt%, indicating a proportion of total carbon deposits on catalyst in several hours (11.0% carbon deposits C in glycerol feeding). The amount of mass loss in the first phase (PH1) of 431–515°C is 3.6% for Ni–Cu–Al catalyst, and this may be due to the removal of outer surface carbons and some volatile compounds. The second phase (PH2) is located at 515–623°C and the peak of the dW/dt curve appears at 522°C, most carbons are removed in this phase. The third phase (PH3) is 638–665°C and the amount of mass loss in this phase is 7.1%, which may be due to the removal of the precipitation of atomic carbons inside the catalyst. After 665°C, spent catalyst reaches constant weight and this indicates that catalyst deactivated by carbons deposits could be regenerated by burning off the carbons. The mass loss, initial mass loss temperature, maximum mass loss temperature and final mass loss temperature for each phase are shown in Table 1 . This has established the fact that different types of carbons may be formed on different locations on the catalyst and were removed at different temperature stages."
8,Kinetic analysis,"3.3 Kinetic analysis The activity of a catalyst is related to the population of the active sites on the catalyst surface. Therefore, the catalyst deactivation can be considered as the decrease of the number of active sites. Carbon deposit is a common cause of deactivation. It is possible to study catalyst decay and reaction kinetics independently by separable kinetics method: (4) Separable kinetics : - r A = - r A ( Fresh catalyst ) × α ( Past history ) The activity of the catalyst at time t, α(t), can be defined as the ratio of the rate of reaction on a catalyst that has been used for a time t to the rate of reaction on a fresh catalyst (t =0). (5) α ( t ) = - r A ( t ) - r A ( t = 0 ) For glycerol steam reforming reaction, the overall reaction rate under the given inlet condition, which is assuming that no heat and mass transfer effects, is a function of three factors including: reaction stoichiometry, configuration of reactor and inherent reaction mechanism. The balance equations are as follows if ignoring CO and CH4 production. (6) p j = P F j F G + F W + F H + F C + F I where FG = F 0(1− X), FW = FW 0 −3F 0 X, FH = FH 0 +7F 0 X, FC = FC 0 +3F 0 X, and FI = FI 0. The pj is the partial pressure of any component, P is the total pressure of the reaction, F is the molar flow rate, X is the conversion of glycerol, and the subscripts G, W, H, C, and I refer to glycerol, water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and inert, respectively. In fact, it is reasonable for ignoring the CO and CH4 rates because of the very small amounts of CO and CH4 products from glycerol steam reforming. In order to ensure that the data were collected in true kinetic regime and transport effects are not significant, some criteria were examined, including: (1) the bed height to particle diameter ratio (L/dp ) should be greater than 50, and (2) the Peclet number (Pe) should be greater than the minimum Peclet number of 7.3. In this study, Re refers to the Reynolds number, L/dp >100 and Pe >55, where: (7) P e = 0.087 Re p 0.23 L d p The reactor was considered as plug flow with no gas expansion by a constant flow rate through the catalyst bed. In general, the reaction rate of glycerol steam reforming depends on the actual reaction conditions as well as on the activity, which is a function of the previous catalyst history. Because of the catalyst decay, the activity decreases with time. The rate of disappearance of reactant on a catalyst that has been utilized for a time t is: (8) - r A = α ( t ) k 1 f ( X ) where k 1 is the reaction rate constant; f(X) is gas-phase concentration of reactants, products, or contaminant. In previous work, some researchers empirically described the amount of coke on the surface as a function of time-on-stream via the following relationship [23]: (9) C C = At n where CC is the concentration of carbons on the surface, A is a constant depending on the feedstock, reactor type, reaction conditions and n is an exponent. Different functionalities between the activity and amount of carbons on the surface of catalyst have been observed, and one commonly used form for activity of the catalyst is [21]: (10) α ( t ) = 1 1 + K CK C C P where KCK and P are the parameters on carbon amount on the catalyst. Eq. (10) can be written in terms of time: (11) α ( t ) = 1 1 + K CK A P t nP = 1 1 + k ′ t m where k′ is a constant on carbon deposition. Assuming m =1, the activity of the catalyst can be obtained as [21]: (12) α ( t ) = 1 1 + k ′ t Reaction rate equation can be written as: (13) - r A = F 0 W dX dt where F 0 is the molar flow rate, and W is the mass of the catalyst. In this study, it is assumed that the power law model with first order can predict the main reaction in glycerol steam reforming. Thus, the rate equation can be written as: (14) - r A = k α ( t ) X For the value of X at any time t, we find that: (15) X = 1 ( 1 + k ′ t ) k 1 / k ′ where k 1 = k W F 0 . Eq. (15) is used to model the X − t data, and the parameters of k′ and k can be estimated by minimizing the equation for the sum of the squares of the errors (SSE). (16) ∑ i = 1 N ( X ) cal - ( X i ) exp 2 = Q ( k ′ , k 1 ) The activation energies of reforming reaction and catalyst decay by using the following Arrhenius equations were determined by the following equation: (17) k ′ = k 0 ′ ( T 0 ) exp E ′ R 1 T 0 - 1 T (18) k = k 0 ( T 0 ) exp E R 1 T 0 - 1 T The modeling and experimental results of X and t are shown in Fig. 8 and kinetics parameters are shown in Table 2 . The linear relationships between k′ and k and 1/T are well satisfied for the runs. Catalytic deactivation adds another level of complexity to sorting out the reaction rate law parameters and pathways. In spite of several simplifying for modeling process, the kinetics on glycerol steam reforming have been accurately described by means of kinetic model involving the separability concept of rate law and activity."
9,Conclusions,"The synthesized Ni–Cu–Al catalyst for H2 production from glycerol steam reforming has been evaluated experimentally in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor. The experimental data were analyzed based on the thermodynamic calculations by a non-stoichiometric thermodynamic code on the chemical equilibrium. The glycerol conversion and H2 selectivity were increased with increasing temperatures. The deactivation of catalyst due to the formation of carbons was obvious. TGA experiment of the reacted Ni–Cu–Al catalyst indicated three phases in the carbon removal process. The separable kinetic concept based on separating the rate law and activity was used to model glycerol steam reforming. A quantitative specification of the catalytic activity was made, and the kinetic parameters were calculated."
