0,Introduction,"As a clean energy carrier between the renewable energy, such as solar and wind, and the energy-dependent economy, hydrogen has been considered as an ideal solution to mitigating the dependency on the ever-depleting fossil fuels, so as to suppress the ever-increasing environmental pollution [1–5]. The superiorities of hydrogen that possesses the high gravimetric energy density (33 kWh kg−1) [6], the high calorific value (142 MJ kg−1) [7] and the high power generation efficiency (40%–60%) [8] make us actively pursue a future hydrogen society. To construct an ideal hydrogen society, it is urgently desirable to achieve the clean and sustainable hydrogen production. Currently, hydrogen is mainly produced by steam reforming [9–11] and water electrolysis [12,13], as shown in Fig. 1 a and Fig. 1b respectively. Despite the obvious advantages of large scale and low cost, the steam reforming for hydrogen production still suffers from most challenging problems, such as impurity, low efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions [14]. In contrast, water electrolysis is more attractive because it can be compatible with the renewable energy, e.g. solar and wind, and has been recognized as one of the most important technologies to mitigate the intermittency and regionality of the renewable energy [15–17]. Although appealing, the electricity that is consumed by water electrolysis is high, typically, 48.2 kWh kg−1 at 1.8 V [18], which has been highlighted by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) [19]. The consumed electricity of water splitting is exhausted on the thermodynamic potential barrier and the electrokinetic overpotential of both cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [20,21]. To address these issues, a prevailing approach is focusing on synthesizing cost-effective electrocatalysts with high activity and stability [22–24]. This can indeed save both energy and cost, but there is still a long way to go to commercialize a high-performance long-lifetime electrocatalyst for the water electrolysis. Additionally, comparing with hydrogen, the economic value of oxygen is relatively low, let alone the possible safety hazard due to the simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen [25,26]. One promising alternative energy-saving strategy is to replace the anodic water with the readily oxidizable species with a lower oxidation potential barrier. Among them, ammonia [27], alcohols (methanol [28] and ethanol [29–31]), hydrazine [32,33], urea [34] and metal materials (Li [35], Zn [36,37] and Al [38]) have been extensively investigated to break through the bottleneck caused by the OER. Besides the hydrogen production, it seems that the hydrogen society is hindered by the transportation and storage of the hydrogen at present [6,39–41]. Apparently, more reliable, high-efficient, energy-saving, low-carbon and renewable hydrogen production, storage and transportation patterns need to be developed to meet all the requirements toward a future hydrogen society. Formate, a hydrogen carrier and solar fuel, possesses unique advantages over the above-mentioned fuels. Formate can be coupled with solar energy and synthetized by electrochemical [42], thermochemical [43], photochemical [44] and biochemical [45] reduction of carbon dioxide. The synthesis of formate is easier and more energy-saving than that of other carbon dioxide reducing chemicals, such as methanol and ethanol, because it does not undergo the complete dissociation of C–O bond [46], and requires fewer formation energy of C–H bond instead of high energy-intensive C–C bond [47]. Moreover, formate is ultra-stable and does not have the safety problems of flammability and toxicity. Therefore, it is suitable for long-term storage and long-distance transportation in its solid or liquid state to solve the current problems in hydrogen storage and transportation [48]. Herein, an electricity-hydrogen co-produced Na-ion direct formate fuel cell (e-h2 Na-DFFC) is proposed as one of the new patterns of hydrogen production (Fig. 1c), which can realize the electrochemical conversion from sodium formate to hydrogen and electricity. Preliminary experimental results show that the e-h2 Na-DFFC achieves the high purity (~100%), the high Faradic efficiency (99.8%), and the high yield rate (2.9 mL min−1 cm−2) of hydrogen production, and can generate a large amount of electric energy (21.4 kWh kg−1, discharging at 0.8 V) simultaneously. Moreover, it exhibits long-term electrochemical stability, while the produced hydrogen can be directly used to drive hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells."
1,Experiment section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Graphite felt (1.0 mm in thickness) was purchased from Jingu Ltd (Liaoning, China). Pd/C (30 wt%) and Pt/C (46.2 wt%) were, respectively, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and TKK (Japan). Nafion membrane (N115) and solution were from DuPont (USA). Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were obtained from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Sodium formate (HCOONa), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA)."
3,Membrane electrode assembly preparation,"2.2 Membrane electrode assembly preparation Before preparing the MEAs, the Nafion 115 membrane was first immersed in 5 wt% H2O2 at 85 °C for 1 h, and then boiled in deionized (DI) water for 1 h, subsequently, soaked in 5 M NaOH aqueous solution for 3 h to replace the H+ with Na+, finally rinsed and stored with DI water before use. Additionally, the graphite felt was firstly rinsed with DI water, and then dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 60 °C, subsequently, treated in a muffle furnace for 4 h at 400 °C to increase its wettability. When fabricating electrodes, the commercial catalyst and Nafion solution were dispersed in ethanol to form catalyst inks. The thermally treated graphite felts were directly dipped into the anode catalyst inks that contained Pd/C and 10 wt% Nafion ionomer and the cathode catalyst inks that consisted of Pt/C and 10 wt% Nafion ionomer to form anode and cathode electrodes, respectively. To obtain MEA, the Na+-conducting cation-exchange membrane was sandwiched between the homemade anode and cathode electrodes without hot pressing."
4,Electrode characterization,"2.3 Electrode characterization A GeminiSEM 500 microscope (Germany) was employed to obtain the SEM images and EDS elemental mappings. The contact angles were obtained by an Attension Theta equipment (Biolin Scientific, Sweden). An electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) was used for the electrochemical characterization of prepared electrodes. A graphite rod and an Hg/HgO electrode respectively acted as the counter electrode and reference electrode. The geometric area and catalyst loading of the electrodes used for the characterization were, respectively, 1.0 cm2 and 25 μg. For the cyclic voltammetry (CV), the scan rate was set at 10 mV s−1 and all the solutions were bubbled with N2 for 30 min before each testing. The AC impedance was measured at a frequency of 10−2 to 10−5 Hz with a signal of 5 mV at open circuit potential."
5,Fuel cell setup and test conditions,"2.4 Fuel cell setup and test conditions As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1c, the e-h2 Na-DFFC consists of an anode, a cathode, and a Na+-conducting cation-exchange membrane. Graphite felt electrodes and graphite flow-field plates, instead of metallic materials, are applied in the e-h2 Na-DFFC to avoid hydrogen production from hydrogen evolution corrosion. The performance and stability of electricity-hydrogen co-produced Na-ion direct formate fuel cell (e-h2 Na-DFFC) were measured and recorded by an electrochemical workstation (Arbin BT-G). The reactant of both anode and cathode was supplied by a peristaltic pump (Longer BT100-1F). The difference is that the anode reductant is the mixed solution of sodium formate and sodium hydroxide, and the cathode oxidant is sulfuric acid solution. A pair of electrical heating rods were installed in the graphite collector plates to control the operating temperature of this hydrogen production device. The produced gas was collected by a drainage method, and then injected into a gas chromatograph (Fuli GC9790II), which was integrated with a 5 A molecular sieve packed column and a thermal conductivity detector, by Ar as carrier-gas. The visual images of produced hydrogen were monitored by a high-speed camera (MitionPro Y7)."
6,Working principle of e-h2 Na-DFFC,"In the anode of e-h2 Na-DFFC, the mixed solution of sodium formate and sodium hydroxide was continuously pumped into the anode flow field, and then transferred to the anode active sites, wherein HCOO- was oxidized to HCO 3 - at the catalyst/liquid double-phase boundary [49]: (1) HCOO - + 2 OH - → HCO 3 - + H 2 O + 2 e - E anode 0 = - 1.05 V The generated electrons passed through external circuit to the cathode, whereas the cathode electrode was supplied with sulfuric acid for HER: (2) 2 H + + 2 e - → H 2 E cathode 0 = 0 V In the meantime, the anode sodium ions migrated through Na+-conducting cation-exchange membrane to the cathode to compensate the charge difference. Accordingly, the overall reaction can be expressed as: (3) HCOO - + 2 H + + 2 O H - → H 2 + H 2 O + HC O 3 - E overall 0 = 1.05 V To further describe the reaction, the current-potential curves of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), FOR, HER, HOR, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and OER which conform to Butler–Volmer kinetics are schematically illustrated in Fig. 2 . Theoretically, three different types of fuel cell and six different kinds of electrolyzer can be constructed from the curves in Fig. 2. Among them, the theoretical open circuit voltage (OCV) of e-h2 Na-DFFC is 1.05 V, which possesses the potential of electricity generation and hydrogen production simultaneously."
7,Results and discussion,"The pristine graphite felt was thermally treated to increase its wettability. As shown in Fig. S1, the contact angle of thermally treated graphite felt (69°) is smaller than that of pristine graphite felt (126.2°), indicating that the heat treatment effectively improves the hydrophilicity of graphite felt, which is beneficial to boost the cell performance of direct liquid fuel cells. Considering the easy implementability of the device, the commercial Pd/C and Pt/C were used for anode and cathode catalysts respectively. To enhance the electrochemical conversion process, a three-dimensional (3D) integrated graphite felt electrode that integrates the catalyst and diffusion layers was prepared for both anode and cathode electrodes with a dip-coating method [50]. The SEM images and EDS elemental mapping of pristine graphite felt, anode and cathode electrodes are shown in Fig. 3 . The anode and cathode electrodes possess the same porous structure as the pristine graphite felt (Fig. 3a–c), and the microscale pores facilitate the mass and charge transport. At higher magnification (Fig. 3d–f), it can be seen that the catalyst nanoparticles were uniformly coated on the carbon skeleton. The elemental distribution of C in pristine graphite felt, Pd in anode electrode and Pt in cathode electrode were illustrated in Fig. 3g–i, which further proved that Pd and Pt were deposited on the anode and cathode electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical oxidation performance of anode electrode is investigated in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4a and b show CV curves of pristine graphite felt and anode electrode in 1.0 M NaOH with or without 1.0 M HCOONa solution. It can be calculated from the reduction peak area of PdO that the electrochemically active surface area (EASA) of anode electrode is 37.8 m2 g−1, much higher than that of the pristine graphite felt [51]. Moreover, the anode electrode exhibits a low onset potential of 0.12 V and a high maximum current density of 67.4 mA cm−2 toward FOR, suggesting its good electrochemical oxidation activity. The Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of pristine graphite felt and anode electrode is shown in Fig. 4c. Theoretically, the internal resistance, charge transfer resistance and mass diffusion resistance are respectively obtained from the intersection between the semicircle and the real axis in high frequency of EIS, the semicircle diameter of EIS, and the slope of EIS at low-frequency section. Due to the introduction of Nafion binder, the anode electrode exhibits an internal resistance of 3.7 Ω, which is slightly higher than that of pristine graphite felt (3.5 Ω). However, the Pd/C catalyst reduces the charge transfer resistance of FOR, which can be confirmed by the lower charge transfer resistance of anode electrode (7.1 Ω) than pristine graphite felt (10.3 Ω). The anode electrode yields a higher current density than pristine graphite felt over the constant voltage discharging at 0.5 V vs RHE (Fig. 4d), revealing the good stability of anode electrode. The electrochemical reduction performance of cathode electrode is also investigated in Fig. S2. The overpotential of cathode electrode towards hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is 100 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is significantly lower than that of pristine graphite felt (407 mV). The chronoamperometry curves at −0.2 V vs RHE further confirm the high catalytic activity and stability of the cathode electrode. Fig. 5 a plots the polarization and power density curves of e-h2 Na-DFFC at room temperature. As seen, a peak power density (PPD) of 43 mW cm−2 is achieved at a current density of 120 mA cm−2, suggesting its feasibility of electricity generation. However, an unexpected OCV of 1.16 V is observed (Fig. 5a), higher than the theoretical OCV (1.05 V). The high OCV can be traced back to the inevitable dissolved oxygen in the cathodic sulfuric acid solution ( 4 H + + 4 e - + O 2 → 2 H 2 O E cathode 0 = 1.23 V ). The introduction of dissolved oxygen will increase the theoretical OCV of the e-h2 Na-DFFC to 2.28 V. The impact of dissolved oxygen on e-h2 Na-DFFC performance was investigated in Fig. 5b. It can be witnessed that the cell voltage of e-h2 Na-DFFC improves with the content of dissolved oxygen at the low current density region. However, when the current density is higher than 120 mA cm−2, the cell performance varies slightly due to the depletion of dissolved oxygen. In order to eliminate the influence of dissolved oxygen and ensure the purity of produced hydrogen, the sulfuric acid solution in the following experiments was saturated with nitrogen for 30 min. To exploit the potential of this preliminary cell in electricity and hydrogen co-production, it was set to discharge continuously at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5c). The stable cell voltage maintained for 12 h demonstrates the feasibility of long-term operation, which will be further investigated below. The produced gas was collected by a drainage method (Fig. S3) and the visual images can be observed from Fig. 5d. From the gas chromatography signal shown in Fig. 5e, no gas is detected other than hydrogen, indicating the high purity of hydrogen and promising prospect for direct application in the future hydrogen society. Previous studies have demonstrated that the performance of fuel cells is mainly affected by the electrode electrochemical kinetics and species (including mass, ion and electron) transports [52–54]. In this work, both anode and cathode electrodes consist of a 3D graphite felt substrate and catalyst directly coated on it. The electrochemical kinetics is closely associated with the electrochemical active surface area (EASA), which is dominantly determined by the catalyst loading. Electrons are conducted via the continuous conductive skeleton, mass and ions are transferred through the whole interconnected hierarchical porosity of graphite felt electrode. In order to gain the insight into performance of e-h2 Na-DFFC, the influences of catalyst loading and solution concentration of both anode and cathode were investigated and experimental results were shown in Figs. S4–8. It can be seen, the optimization of catalyst loading and solution concentration improves the cell performance from 31 mW cm−2 to 58 mW cm−2, which can be attributed to the expanded EASA and enhanced species transport in e-h2 Na-DFFC. Fig. 6 a presents the cell performance of e-h2 Na-DFFC with different operating temperatures. The PPD of e-h2 Na-DFFC improves monotonically from 58 mW cm−2 to 168 mW cm−2, while the theoretical hydrogen production rate increases from 1.1 mL min−1 cm−2 to 2.9 mL min−1 cm−2. This is because elevating the operating temperature can effectively boost the electrochemical conversion process in e-h2 Na-DFFC by jointly reducing the activation loss, ohmic loss and concentration loss. Considering the slight fluctuation of the polarization curve at 80 °C (Fig. 6a), the subsequent polarization and constant-current discharging processes of the e-h2 Na-DFFC were conducted at 60 °C. To obtain the actual hydrogen production rate, the Faradic efficiency (FE) during the electrochemical conversion process of e-h2 Na-DFFC needs to be measured. Fig. 6b depicts the co-production stability of hydrogen and electricity at different current densities. As seen, the cell voltage exhibits negligible decay over 1 h continuous discharge at 50 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2. The slight fluctuation of cell voltage at 200 mA cm−2 is caused by the influence of excessive hydrogen production rate on e-h2 Na-DFFC device with low electrode geometric area (1 × 1 cm2), which will be scaled up below. The amount of hydrogen (Fig. 6c) during the constant-current discharging of Fig. 6b was recorded by a drainage method and the corresponding FEs were calculated, which can be maintained over 98.9% (Fig. 6d). The high hydrogen production FEs were benefited from that the nitrogen saturated sulfuric acid solution, which can eliminate the cathodic ORR to the greatest extent. Considering the practical operation of hydrogen production device, the e-h2 Na-DFFC was set to return to the OCV state every 12 h during the constant-current discharging at 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6e). The relatively stable performance further indicates the advantage of our proposed device for long-term practical operation. Additionally, the capability of producing hydrogen on demand by adjusting the current density (Supporting videos) is also conducive to its practical application.

The following is/are the supplementary data related to this article: Multimedia component 2 Multimedia component 2 Multimedia component 3 Multimedia component 3 Multimedia component 4 Multimedia component 4 Multimedia component 5 Multimedia component 5 To further demonstrate the scalability and applicability of this proposed technology, the scaled-up e-h2 Na-DFFC (4 × 4 cm2) was directly integrated with a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell (1 × 1 cm2) by a gas-liquid separation device (Fig. 7 a). The scaled-up e-h2 Na-DFFC yields a peak power of 1.7 W and a maximum current of 8.2 A (Fig. 7b), which are respectively 106 mW cm−2 and 513 mA cm−2 when normalized by the active geometric area (4 × 4 cm2). The obtained cell performance is close to that of the small-sized e-h2 Na-DFFC (117 mW cm−2 and 540 mA cm−2, respectively) under the same operating conditions, indicating its excellent scalability. After that, it was set to produce hydrogen and electricity simultaneously at a current of 2 A. As observed from Fig. 7b, hydrogen is produced stably and continuously for 35 h at a flow rate of 15.2 sccm, which can be directly put into practice, lowering the system cost substantially. As a typical representative, the produced hydrogen was directly supplied to a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, which exhibits a peak power density of 546 mW cm−2 (Fig. 7c) and a long-term operation stability over 35 h (Fig. 7d) at room temperature. Additionally, during the electrochemical conversion process of hydrogen production and utilization, 33.5 Wh and 14.1 Wh electric energy can be generated, respectively. The on-site production and utilization of hydrogen not only possess promising economic and environmental benefits, but also can solve the problem of hydrogen storage and transportation."
8,Outlook,"The development of hydrogen society will bring rich returns to the countries with technical advantages in renewable hydrogen production, high-density hydrogen storage and transportation, and high-efficient hydrogen utilization. The essence of the hydrogen society is to achieve the transformation (decarbonization) and upgrading (hydrogenation) of energy structure. The energy interconnection and coupling is the research focus of future energy system. As the bridge between carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the e-h2 Na-DFFC is proposed as a promising avenue for materializing the hydrogen society. In this large-scale system (Fig. 8 ), the formate can be readily synthetized by electrochemical, thermochemical, photochemical and biochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in conjunction with solar energy to provide a solar fuel. As an ultra-stable, non-toxic and non-flammable hydrogen carrier, formate is suitable for long-term storage and long-distance transportation in its solid or liquid state to solve the problems in hydrogen storage and transportation. The synthetized formate can be supplied to different types of fuel cells [55,56] that are reported by our group for generating electricity and producing chemical feedstocks (e.g. NaOH and H2). Impressively, the electricity and NaOH co-production sodium-ion direct formate fuel cell (e-oh Na-DFFC) was proposed and investigated, which can be directly applied to the capture, conversion, and utilization of carbon dioxide recycling system [57]. Moreover, the e-h2 Na-DFFC in this work can simultaneously produce electricity and hydrogen, which exhibits excellent stability, scalability and applicability for the practical application. In this regard, the proposed technology provides a new pathway for electrochemical conversion from initial carbon dioxide to final electricity and hydrogen, which can be coupled with renewable energy to materialize the hydrogen society."
9,Conclusion,"An e-h2 Na-DFFC was proposed and fabricated by integrating FOR anode and HER cathode with a Na+-conducting cation-exchange membrane. Its capability of simultaneous electricity generation and hydrogen production was experimentally demonstrated by constant-current discharging curves along with visual bubble images and gas chromatography. The optimization of cell performance brought a peak power density as high as 168 mW cm−2 and the corresponding hydrogen production rate reaches 2.9 mL min−1 cm−2. Moreover, the excellent scalability, stability and applicability of e-h2 Na-DFFC facilitate its complementation with renewable energy to realize the hydrogen society. Given that formate can be readily derived from atmospheric carbon dioxide via various reduction synthesis methods, the proposed hydrogen production device provides a new way for the electrochemical conversion from initial carbon dioxide to final electricity and hydrogen."
