0,Introduction,"Fossil energy sources are not renewable and will be exhausted one day, so it is very urgent for the exploration of substitutes. Hydrogen (H2) energy is a promising alternative, because H2 has high energy content per unit weight and does not generate any toxic byproduct [1]. However, traditional methods of H2 production are costly [2]. The biological H2 (bio-H2) production by algae, phototropic bacteria or anaerobic fermentation bacteria is not only an environmental friendly but also energy saving process [3]. Furthermore, industrial and agricultural wastes can be used as substrates for the bio-H2 production, which facilitates both waste treatment and energy recovery [4]. Due to the advantage of higher production rate, H2 production by anaerobic fermentation has more potential for development [5–7]. Biomasses such as crops, agricultural and industrial wastes and cellulosic municipal solid wastes can be used to produce H2 by fermentation after being hydrolyzed to sugars. However, the enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic materials is inefficient because of many reasons such as the limited accessible surface area and enzyme adsorption. In natural cellulosic materials, lignin and hemicellulose are bounded covalently to form a natural barrier to prevent the attack of enzyme, which further impedes enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis, cellulosic materials must be pretreated so as to remove lignin and hemicellulose [8,9]. In addition, in the hydrolysis process, after adsorbing onto the surface of substrate, the enzyme needs to perform many successive catalytic actions by desorbing efficiently from the substrate. The irreversible adsorption of enzyme on the substrate has been proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible for the enzyme deactivation. Thus, it is essential to enhance the frequency of enzyme adsorption and desorption from the substrate surface in order to improve the hydrolysis efficiency of cellulose [10]. According to some studies [11–13], ultrasonic radiation with appropriate intensity can enhance the accessibility of substrate for enzyme adsorption and the enzyme catalytic activity, and eventually improve the hydrolysis efficiency. Apple pomace (AP) is rich in carbohydrates, acids, fibres, vitamin C and minerals [14]. In China, the yield of AP as a byproduct of juice extraction is more than 1 million tons, but only a small amount of AP is used for deep processing, and the vast majority is not effectively utilized yet. At present, it is mainly used as a feed component, which is a huge loss of precious natural resources. Several other utilization ways have been proposed for AP, such as the production of l-Lactic acid, ethanol and citric acid [15–17]. But so far, an ideal use for AP has not yet been found. In our previous study on the fermentative H2 production from AP [18], we found that it was a very potential substrate to produce H2 after pretreatment, and two good pretreatment methods were suggested as follows: one is the ultrasonic irradiation AP for 1h in 0.5% H2SO4 solution (UAP), the other is the AP soaked in 6% ammonia liquor at room temperature for 24h (AAP). Meantime, an optimal fermentation condition was suggested as follows: temperature 37°C and initial pH 7.0. In this work, a series of batch experiments were conducted (a) to obtain an optimal HCl pretreatment concentration for AP and (b) an optimal enzymatic hydrolysis condition with the HCl-pretreated AP as the fermentation substrate, and (c) investigate the effects of cellulase dosage, ultrasonic irradiation time and substrate concentration on the fermentative H2 production from the AP with enzymatic saccharification."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemical pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of AP substrate,"2.1 Chemical pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of AP substrate Apple pomace (AP) used in this paper was obtained from a juice-making factory. Prior to use, AP was grinded and then screened with 80-mesh sieve. Its main components were analyzed as follows: cellulose 16.91%, lignin 24.11%, hemicelluloses 20.00%, ash 2.18%, and moisture 2.87%. AP soaked in the various concentrations (0, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6% and 0.8%) of dilute HCl solution with a solid to liquid ratio of 1: 10 was heated at 70°C for 2h, and then the pH value of the mixture solution was adjusted to 7.0 with dilute NaOH solution. AP was hydrolyzed by the cellulase catalysis at the fixed pH value of 5.0, the substrate concentration of 20g/l, and a given time, temperature and cellulase dosage."
3,Seed microflora,2.2 Seed microflora The natural sludge used in this study was obtained from the Bahe river sludge of Xi'an city. It was boiled for 15min to eliminate the methane-forming bacteria and enrich the H2-producing bacteria before it was used as the seed sludge.
4,Batch experiments,"2.3 Batch experiments Batch experiments were conducted by using 150ml three-necked flasks as reactor, and the operating volume of each batch fermentation solution was the 100ml mixture containing the heat-pretreated sludge, substrate and nutrient stock solution. All the fermentation experiments at the present work were carried out at the initial pH value of 7.0 and the constant temperature of 37°C, and the experimental data of each point shown in figures was repeatedly conducted by three parallel experiments whose data error was in the range of or under 5% and averagely obtained. The reactor was sealed with a continuous stirring of 120rpm to ensure thorough mixing and facilitate the rapid diffusion of biogas. The volume and composition of biogas were continually monitored once every 30min until the end of fermentation reaction. The liquor samples were taken for the analysis of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols after the fermentation. One liter of culture medium contained: l-cysteine, 600mg; NaCl, 2000mg; KH2PO4, 2000mg; MgSO4·7H2O, 500mg; FeSO4·7H2O, 6mg; VC, 10mg; VA, 0.6mg; VD2, 0.0075mg; VB1, 0.3mg; VB2, 0.15mg; VB6, 0.02mg."
5,Analyses,"2.4 Analyses The volume of biogas produced was recorded by the water-displacement method. The composition and proportion of 100μL biogas sampled periodically was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-SP-6890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a packed 3-mm inside diameter stainless steel (molecular sieve TDX-01). Argon was used as the carrier gas at the flow rate of 40ml/min. The operational temperatures at the column oven, injection and detector were kept at 90, 130 and 130°C, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of HCl pretreatment on H2 production,"3.1 Effect of HCl pretreatment on H2 production Fig. 1 depicts the effects of HCl concentration on the cumulative H2 yield (CHYm) and the average H2 production rate (AHPR) at the fixed fermentation substrate concentration of 20g/l and the temperature of 37°C. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the CHYm increased remarkably with the increase of HCl concentration in the range of 0–0.6%. A maximum cumulative H2 yield of 83.14ml/g total solid (TS) was observed at the HCl concentration of 0.6%, and then the CHYm declined to 78.05ml/g TS as the HCl concentration increased to 0.8%. This phenomenon indicated that a relatively higher HCl concentration was conducive to the hydrolysis of substrate but a much higher Cl− anion introduced into the culture medium would inhibit the growth of H2-producing bacteria, this result was consistent with the others [19,20]. As far as the AHPR in Fig. 1 are concerned, the maximum AHPR of 4.43ml/g TS/h was obtained at the HCl concentrations of 0.4% and 0.6%, and the further increase of HCl concentration did not increase AHPR obviously. It is concluded that an optimal HCl concentration for the pretreatment of AP was 0.6% with a maximum H2 yield of 83.14ml/g TS and AHPR of 4.43ml/g TS/h. So, according to the above results and our previous study [18], three effective pretreatment methods for AP are suggested as follows: one is AP in 0.5% H2SO4 solution by ultrasonic irradiation for 1h (denoted as UAP) [18], another is the soaking AP in 6% ammonia liquor at room temperature for 24h (denoted as AAP) [18], and the third is the heating AP at 70°C for 2h in 0.6% HCl solution (denoted as HAP)."
8,Effect of enzyme hydrolysis on H2 production,"3.2 Effect of enzyme hydrolysis on H2 production To obtain the optimal enzyme hydrolysis time and temperature, the hydrolyzed HAPs at various enzyme hydrolysis times and temperatures were used as the fermentation substrate to produce bio-H2. At a given time, temperature and cellulase dosage, all the experiments of enzyme hydrolysis by the cellulase catalysis below were performed at the pH value of 5.0 and the hydrolysis substrate concentration of 20g/L. 3.2.1 Effect of enzyme hydrolysis time At a fixed enzymatic temperature of 50°C and cellulase dosage of 10.0mg/g TS, the HAP was hydrolyzed by the cellulase catalysis for 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72h, and then the hydrolyzed HAPs were used as the fermentation substrates for the bio-H2 production. All the fermentation experiments were conducted at the initial pH 7.0 and 37°C with a substrate concentration of 20g/L. Fig. 2 shows the effect of the enzymatic time on the CHYm and AHPR. As shown in Fig. 2, the CHYm and AHPR increased as the enzymatic time increased in the range of 0–48h. A maximum H2 yield of 95.78ml/g TS and average H2 production rate of 5.61ml/g TS/h were observed at 48h, and then the CHYm and AHPR declined as enzymatic time increased. This is because the further increase in enzymatic time intensified some adverse reactions, such as the glucose degraded into furfural, and the monosaccharide condensed into polysaccharide. It is concluded that the optimal enzyme hydrolysis time is indicated to be at 48h, at which a maximum H2 yield of 95.78ml/g TS and AHPR of 5.61ml/g TS/h were obtained. 3.2.2 Effect of enzyme hydrolysis temperature The HAP was hydrolyzed at a cellulase dosage of 10.0mg/g TS and the enzymatic temperatures of 30, 40, 45, 50 and 60°C for 48h, and then the hydrolyzed HAPs were used as the fermentation substrates for the bio-H2 production. Fermentation conditions were similar to the mentioned above. Fig. 3 indicates the change curves of CHYm and AHPR versus enzyme temperature. As depicted in Fig. 3, the CHYm and AHPR had the same change trend. When the temperature increased from 30 to 45°C, the CHYm increased from 88.39 to 106.43ml/g TS, and the corresponding AHPR increased from 5.93 to 8.35ml/g TS/h. Subsequently, the CHYm and AHPR sharply declined to 81.74ml/g TS and 5.66ml/g TS/h at 60°C, respectively. This result could be attributed to the thermal inactivation of endoglucanase I and cellobiohydrolase I [21,22]. Accordingly, it is suggested that an optimal temperature for the HAP enzyme hydrolysis was at 45°C for 48h with a cellulase dosage of 10.0mg/g TS and a hydrolysis substrate concentration of 20g/L hydrolyzed at the pH value of 5.0. 3.2.3 Effect of cellulase dosages The enzyme hydrolysis of the UAP, AAP and HAP with a cellulase dosage of 0–15mg/g TS at a substrate concentration of 20g/L was carried out under the above optimal enzyme hydrolysis conditions (45°C and 48h), and subsequently the enzymatic hydrolysates were used as the fermentation substrate to produce H2. The results are presented in Fig. 4 . It is apparent from Fig. 4a–c that the H2 evolution occurred after a lag time of 4–5h, and then the CHY increased rapidly with time and finally reached a maximum value in the range of around 5–14h. But the change trend of CHYm vs. time was different for the various pretreated-substrates at the various cellulase dosages. E.g., for the UAP, the CHYm basically increased from 76.68 to 93.51ml/g TS with increasing the cellulase dosage from 0 to 10mg/g TS, but as the enzyme dosage further increased from 12.5 to 15mg/g TS no visible difference in CHYm (from 89.50 to 87.99ml/g TS) was observed in Fig. 4a. While a similar change trends of CHYm with enzyme dosage for AAP and HAP could be observed in Fig. 4b,c, i. e., there was a relatively significant difference in CHYm between the enzyme dosages of 0–10mg/g TS and no obvious difference in the CHYm between the cellulase dosage of 12.5–15mg/g TS. E.g., the CHYm for AAP increased from 80.00 to 105.60ml/g TS with the enzyme dosages of 0–10mg/g TS, and subsequently reached an almost constant data (110.62–110.63ml/g TS) for the enzyme dosages of 12.5–15mg/g TS; The maximum H2 yield of 93.51, 110.63 and 106.43ml/g TS for the UAP, AAP and HAP fermentation were obtained at the cellulase dosages of 10, 12.5 and 10mg/g TS, respectively. It is obvious that the enzymatic hydrolysis could promote the conversion of the substrates to H2 and shorten the fermentation time of bio-H2 production compared to the H2 production from the only HAP fermentation without the enzymatic hydrolysis (83.14ml/g TS). The cellulase dosage in appropriate content could increase H2 yield, but over high cellulase dosage could also result in the decrease of H2 yield. The reason for it may be that the increase of cellulase dosage could enhance the hydrolysis rate of the substrates and further increased the amount of reducing sugars, but a over high cellulase dosages could decrease the adsorption efficiency of substrate surface that lead to decreasing H2 yield due to the decrease of reducing sugars [23,24]. Meanwhile, the cellulase dosage also affected the AHPR, as Fig. 5 shows, the optimal cellulase dosage for the enzyme hydrolysis of the UAP, AAP and HAP was 10, 12.5 and 10mg/g TS with a maximum AHPR of 7.53, 8.35 and 8.35ml/g TS/h, respectively. In addition, among the three pretreated APs (UAP, AAP and HAP), the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of AAP to produce H2 was the highest, while that of UAP was the lowest. To get a sight of the effect of the pretreatments on the enzyme hydrolysis of the substrates, AP without pretreatment used as the substrate for the bio-H2 production was investigated for comparison. A maximum CHYm of 65.81ml/g TS and AHPR of 6.58ml/g TS/h from the untreated AP fermentation were obtained at the cellulase dosage of 12.5mg/g TS, which was much lower than those from the pretreated AP fermentations under the same condition. The result shows that pretreatment can effectively improve the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of the substrates, thus to improve H2 yield."
9,Effect of ultrasonic time on H2 production in optimal cellulase dosages,"3.3 Effect of ultrasonic time on H2 production in optimal cellulase dosages To further get insight into the effect of ultrasonic time on the hydrolysis efficiency, two pretreated APs, i. e. UAP and AAP at the concentration of 20g/l, respectively, were mixed with the cellulases at the dosage of 10mg/g TS and of 12.5mg/g TS in aqueous solution of 45°C and pH 5.0 and treated again by the ultrasonic irradiation with a frequency of 25kHz at the various ultrasonic-times before the enzyme hydrolysis, and then both of which were hydrolyzed under the optimal enzyme hydrolysis conditions of 45°C and 48h (denoted as the ultrasonic UAP and AAP below). The effect of ultrasonic-times on H2 production potential by the fermentation of enzymatic hydrolysates is indicated in Fig. 6 as bar graphs. For both the UAP and AAP, the CHYm increased with increasing the ultrasonic time from 0 to 20min and then decreased from 25 to 30min, but the changes between them were not obvious. The maximum H2 yield of 101.60 and 120.26ml/g TS for the ultrasonic UAP and AAP were obtained at the ultrasonic time of 20min, respectively, which increased by 7.53% and 8.39% compared with those of the UAP and AAP without ultrasonic, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the effect of ultrasonic time on the AHPR for the ultrasonic UAP and AAP. It is apparent that the optimal ultrasonic time was at 20min and the ultrasonic irradiation could enhance the H2 production efficiency although no a significant difference between the various times. This might be due to the UAP and AAP with the given content cellulases treated by ultrasonic to activate cellulases, therefore, resulting in the increase of reducing sugar yield in the process of enzymatic hydrolysis of the ultrasonic UAP and AAP. The method may be applied to the fermentation of corn and wheat straw."
10,Effect of substrate concentration on H2 production,"3.4 Effect of substrate concentration on H2 production Fig. 8 shows the effects of the fermentation substrate concentration on the CHYm for the UAP (a), AAP (b) and HAP (c) under the optimal conditions of the above-obtained enzyme hydrolysis (at 45°C and pH value 5.0 for 48h), cellulase dosages (10, 12.5 and 10mg/g TS) and ultrasonic time (20min). It is clear from Fig. 8 that the CHYm increased remarkably with the increase of the substrate concentration from 10 to 15g/l, especially for the UAP and AAP, and then decreased with the substrate concentration from 20 to 30g/l for the AAP and HAP except the UAP. A maximum H2 yield of 101.60ml/g TS for the UAP was observed in Fig. 8a at the substrate concentrations of 20g/l but no obvious enhancement compared to the result in Fig. 6 and a maximum H2 yield of 134.04 and 117.89ml/g TS for the AAP and HAP were also observed in Fig. 8b,c at the substrate concentrations of 15g/l, respectively. From Fig. 9 , it is found that the optimal substrate concentrations for the UAP, AAP and HAP were 20, 15 and 15g/l with the maximum AHPRs of 8.02, 12.00 and 11.18ml/g TS/h, respectively. The results show that the substrate concentration has significant effect on H2 yield, a relatively higher substrate concentration was favorable to the H2 production, however, too high substrate concentration would also cause the accumulation of VFAs and a fall of pH value in the reactor, thus inhibiting the growth of H2-producing bacteria [25,26]. To accomplish economic feasibility, the conversion of organic wastes to monomeric sugars and finally H2 production must be low cost, and if the process consumes low chemicals and enzymes while still reaching high yields, it can compete with other fuel conversion processes. According to the above fermentation experiment results for the pretreated APs (UAP, AAP and HAP), an optimal H2 production with a CHYm of 134.04ml/g TS and an AHPR of 12.00ml/g TS/h were obtained from the fermentation of the enzyme-hydrolyzed AAP at the substrate concentration 15g/l with an ultrasonic time of 20min under the optimized enzyme hydrolysis conditions (the pH value 5.0, temperature 45°C and cellulase dosage of 12.5mg/g TS for 48h). The H2 yield was increased by 32.60% as compared with the result of AAP without other pretreatments such as the enzyme hydrolysis (time, temperature and cellulase dosage) and ultrasonic irradiation [18]."
11,Conclusions,"The potential of AP as carbon source for the fermentative H2 production at 37°C and the initial pH 7 was investigated through a series of the initial pretreatments (0.5% H2SO4 solution by ultrasonic irradiation, 6% ammonia liquor and 0.6% HCl solution), and the subsequent ultrasonic irradiation and enzyme hydrolysis (temperature, time and cellulase dosage). Based on the comparison of H2 production from the fermentation of three pretreated APs in terms of efficiency and cost, an optimum bio-H2 production with a maximum H2 yield of 134.04ml/g TS and an average H2 production rate of 12.00ml/g TS/h were obtained from the fermentation of the enzyme-hydrolyzed AAP at the fermentation substrate concentration 15g/l, 37°C and the initial pH 7, and the optimum enzyme hydrolysis conditions were as follows: the AAP was hydrolyzed at a pH value 5.0 and 45°C for 48h with a cellulase dosage of 12.5mg/g TS after ultrasonic irradiation for 20min."
