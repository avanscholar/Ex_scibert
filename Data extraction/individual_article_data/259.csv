0,Introduction,"Using photocatalysis and photoelectrochemistry technology to deal with the environment and energy problems have attracted more and more attentions [1–5]. Photocatalytic hydrogen production technology is one of the most important photocatalytic techniques because it can produce hydrogen to replace fossil energy without consuming non-renewable energy [6–9]. However, for the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction system, the secondary recombination and the migration of the photogenerated charge carriers, the reactive sites for the photocatalytic reactions, and the matching of the band structure of the semiconductor materials are all the important factors affecting the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the semiconductor materials [10–13]. It is of great significance for further improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the photocatalysts through rationally design and development of the efficient photocatalytic system to effectively solve the issues of low separation efficiency and transport rate of the photogenerated charge carriers, and small number of reactive sites for the photocatalytic reactions during the photocatalytic hydrogen production process. Hierarchical structure based heterojunction system is promising to solve the problems in the photocatalytic hydrogen production process because it combines the advantages of large specific surface area, fast charge transfer and efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers [14–17]. Furthermore, the Z-scheme heterojunction system can generate photoinduced electrons with strong reducibility and photoinduced holes with strong oxidizability, and can quickly transfer them to the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst to achieve efficient redox reactions [18–21]. Therefore, it has broad application prospects in the field of photocatalysis. In view of this, through designing and synthesizing Z-scheme heterojunction on the surface of a hierarchical photocatalyst, the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency can be greatly improved by the synergistic effect of the hierarchical structure and Z-scheme heterojunction. Wang et al. [22] designed a direct Z-scheme ZnO/CdS hierarchical photocatalyst to explore the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. They found that the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of ZnO/CdS photocatalyst was significantly enhanced under visible light illumination due to the hierarchical structure, extended visible light response and direct Z-scheme mechanism. Meng et al. [23] synthesized a direct Z-scheme TiO2/CdS hierarchical photocatalyst to study the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production activity through a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction technology. The combined effect of the hierarchical structure, intimate interfacial contact and the direct Z-scheme structure significantly improved the photocatalytic performance of the prepared TiO2/CdS photocatalyst. Wang et al. [24] have reported a 3D/2D direct Z-scheme heterojunctions of the hierarchical TiO2 microflowers/g-C3N4 nanosheets. The prepared TiO2/g-C3N4 composite showed excellent photocatalytic activity, which was caused by the synergistic effects of highly dispersed 3D TiO2 microflowers, extended photoresponse to visible light through coordinating with 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets and the strong coupling effect resulting from an efficient direct Z-scheme structure. Although many reports have studied that the Z-scheme photocatalyst with hierarchical structure can significantly improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, it is still a great challenge to design a high-efficiency Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst with well band matching and morphology modification. The Co9S8 is a promising semiconductor for photocatalytic hydrogen production because of its advantages, such as narrow band gap, strong light collecting ability and negative conduction band (CB) potential [25–27]. Tan et al. [25] prepared hierarchical CdS decorated with Co9S8 nanoparticles (NPs) to study the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of the optimized CdS/Co9S8 composite reached 5.15 mmol h−1 g−1, which was attributed to a synergistic effect of the boosted light absorption capacity, increased separation and transfer efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers as well as much stronger reducibility of the photoinduced electrons in the CB of Co9S8. Qiu et al. [26] prepared Z-scheme CdS/Co9S8 hollow cubes using metal-organic frameworks as template and further using ion exchange method, and they found that the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of the prepared Z-scheme CdS/Co9S8 hollow cubes is 1.06 mmol h−1 g−1. The improvement of the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance is attributed to the efficient solar light harvesting of the hollow structure and the Z-scheme system constructed by the strong interaction between CdS and Co9S8. The abovementioned results show that establishing CdS/Co9S8 Z-scheme system can effectively improve its photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. While, the morphology control of Co9S8 ordered structure often requires the assistance of template growth or ion exchange methods [26,28–31], and the template-free Co9S8 ordered structure is seldom reported. In the present work, a CdS/Co9S8 Z-scheme photocatalyst was obtained based on a simple template-free solvothermal and subsequent chemical deposition method. The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CdS/Co9S8 Z-scheme photocatalyst is significantly enhanced compared with those of Co9S8 and CdS. The template-free preparation of hierarchical structured Co9S8 and the establishment of the Z-scheme CdS/Co9S8 heterojunction system provide a new idea for the development and design of the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalytic system."
1,Experimental sections,
2,Preparation of the photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of the photocatalysts Firstly, the Co9S8 hierarchical photocatalyst is prepared by a simple solvothermal method without template. 60 mmol thiourea and 10 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 400 ml DMF solvent, the mixed solution was then transferred into a 500-mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The solvothermal reaction was carried out at 160 °C for 14 h. The precipitate obtained by centrifugation was washed with water and alcohol for several times, and further dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the Co9S8 hierarchical photocatalyst. A series of CdS/Co9S8 photocatalysts were prepared by chemically depositing CdS NPs on the surface of Co9S8. A certain amount of the prepared Co9S8 hierarchical photocatalyst was dissolved into 60 ml aqueous solution containing 10 mmol of Cd(NO3)2 and 10 mmol of CH3CSNH2. After 30 min of stirring at 60 °C controlled by water bath, the obtained sample was washed by water and alcohol for several times, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the CdS/Co9S8 photocatalysts. The prepared CdS/Co9S8 photocatalysts were labeled as CdS/Co9S8-0.4, CdS/Co9S8-0.3, CdS/Co9S8-0.2 and CdS/Co9S8-0.1 with the added amount of the prepared Co9S8 hierarchical photocatalyst being 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1 g, respectively. Pristine CdS NPs was prepared according the above method without adding the Co9S8 hierarchical photocatalyst. All of the reagents used in the present work are from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd."
3,Characterizations of the prepared photocatalysts,"2.2 Characterizations of the prepared photocatalysts The crystalline structures of the prepared photocatalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-2500/PC, Rigaku Co.,Tokyo, Japan). The Raman spectra of the photocatalysts were recorded by a Raman spectrometer (Raman, inVia Qontor, Renishaw, UK,) at room temperature. The morphology of the prepared photocatalyst was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Ultra 55, Zeiss, Germany). The morphology and the interface binding information between different phases in CdS/Co9S8-0.2 were analyzed by field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F20, FEI Company, USA). The elemental distribution, elemental composition and bonding information of the prepared CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 photocatalysts were studied using high angle artificial dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, JEMARM200 F, JEOL, Japan) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra, Kratos AnalyticalLtd., England). UV–vis spectrophotometer (U-41000, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) was used to analyze the optical absorption properties of the prepared photocatalysts. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 were analyzed by a fluorescence spectrometer (PL, Fluoro Max-4, HORIBA Jobin Yvon, France). Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP) measurements of CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 photocatalysts were performed using SKP testing system (VersaSCAN, Ametek). The testing area on the surface of the prepared photoelectrodes was 2 × 2 mm2 and the scanning rate was set as 100 μm·s−1 with the sensitivity of 200 μV. The tungsten probe with the diameter of 250 μm was acted as the reference and detection probe."
4,Photocatalytic performance measurements,"2.3 Photocatalytic performance measurements For measuring the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency, 50 mg of the prepared photocatalyst was dispersed in the mixed solution containing 80 ml deionized water and 20 ml lactic acid. The light source was a 300-W xenon lamp (CEL-SPH2N, Beijing China Education Aulight Co. Ltd., China). The visible light was generated using an ultraviolet cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm), and the light intensity was adjusted to 250 mW⋅ m−2. Before the light was switched on, the photocatalytic reaction system was vacuumized to -0.1 MPa under stirring, and the temperature of the reactor was kept at 9 °C controlled by water-cooling system. During the reaction, the hydrogen production was measured by a gas chromatograph (GC-7920, Beijing China Education Aulight Co. Ltd., China) every 30 min."
5,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a shows the XRD patterns of the prepared photocatalysts. As shown in the XRD pattern of CdS, the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.4°, 43.9° and 51.9° can be clearly found, which correspond to the (111), (220) and (311) crystal faces of cubic CdS (JCPDS: 80–0019), respectively [32,33]. For the XRD pattern of Co9S8, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 29.8°, 31.2°, 35.6°, 39.7°, 47.5°, 51.9° and 54.7° are observed, which correspond to the (311), (222), (400), (331), (511), (400) and (531) crystal faces of Co9S8 (JCPDS: 65-1765), respectively [26,34]. Different from the obvious Co9S8, the characteristic diffraction peaks of CdS is relatively weak because of its less deposition amount and higher dispersion. Raman spectra tests were further performed and the results are shown in Fig. 1b. The Raman peaks corresponding to the first order longitudinal optical mode (1LO) and the second order longitudinal optical mode (2LO) of CdS are easily observed at 301 and 603 cm−1, respectively [35]. The weak Raman peak at 685 cm−1 comes from Co9S8 [28], as shown in the Raman spectrum of the prepared Co9S8. For the prepared CdS/Co9S8 photocatalyst, the intensities of the Raman peaks of CdS become stronger with the decrease of the added amount of Co9S8, which is due to the increase of the CdS NPs deposition amount on the surface of Co9S8. However, no Raman peaks of Co9S8 are observed in the CdS/Co9S8 photocatalysts, which may be due to the interference caused by the strong Raman peaks of CdS. SEM images were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 2 a–f. Fig. 2a shows the SEM image of pristine CdS and NPs with dozens of nanometers can be observed. Fig. 2b shows the SEM image of Co9S8. And nanoflower-like hierarchical structure with approximately 600 nm are observed, which is composed of nanoflakes with smooth surface in the thickness of approximately 50 nm. As shown in the SEM image at low magnification in Fig. 2b, the prepared hierarchical Co9S8 is relatively uniform. Fig. 2c shows the morphology of the CdS/Co9S8-0.4 photocatalyst. Small quantities of CdS NPs are observed on the surface of the nanoflakes. With the decrease of the added amount of Co9S8, the deposited CdS NPs on the surface of Co9S8 become more and more obvious, as shown in Fig. 2c–f. The CdS NPs are found to be evenly dispersed on the surface of Co9S8. However, for CdS/Co9S8-0.1 photocatalyst, some larger NPs appear on the surface of the nanoflakes, which may attribute to the deposition and agglomeration of the relatively large amounts of CdS. Fig. 2g–j show the TEM images of CdS/Co9S8-0.2 and the corresponding element distribution results. As shown in Fig. 2g, the obvious interface of black and gray proves the existence of hierarchical structure of CdS/Co9S8-0.2 from the TEM image at low magnification. As shown in Fig. 2h, by amplifying the edge region of CdS/Co9S8-0.2, the NPs with a size of approximately 5 nm can be clearly observed, which may be the deposited CdS NPs on the surface of Co9S8. The O, S, Co, Cu and Cd elements can be observed in the EDX spectrum shown in the insert in Fig. 2h. Among them, the elements of O and Cu come from the chemically adsorbed oxygen and the carrier copper mesh of CdS/Co9S8-0.2, respectively. Table 1 shows the element contents of CdS/Co9S8-0.2. The atomic ratios of S, Co and O elements are obtained as 46.5 %, 35.12 % and 1.83 %, respectively. The atomic ratio of S element is slightly higher than the theoretical ratio in CdS/Co9S8, which is mainly due to the semi-quantitative measurement of EDX. As shown in Fig. 2i, the clear lattice spacing of 0.33 nm and 0.28 nm are observed, which correspond to the (111) crystal plane of CdS and the (222) crystal plane of Co9S8, respectively. This proves that CdS NPs are successfully deposited on the surface of Co9S8 and the heterojunction is successfully constructed between CdS and Co9S8. Fig. 2j displays the individual elemental mapping results of the prepared CdS/Co9S8-0.2 photocatalyst. The elemental distribution of S, Co and Cd is highly consistent with the morphology of the scanning area. XPS measurements were further performed to analyze the chemical states of different elements in the prepared CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 photocatalysts. Fig. 3 a shows the total survey spectra of the prepared photocatalysts. The elements of C, O, S, Co, Cd are observed. C is derived from the calibration C during the XPS test, and O mainly comes from the adsorbed oxygen on the surface. Fig. 3b displays the S2p XPS core level spectra of the photocatalysts. The characteristic binding energy peaks of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of S element are highly consistent for CdS and Co9S8, and the binding energy peaks at 161.3 and 162.5 eV correspond well to S2− in CdS and Co9S8 [36,37]. For CdS/Co9S8-0.2, the binding energy peaks of S2p3/2 and S2p1/2 display a positive shift of 0.2 eV, indicating the formation of heterojunction between CdS and Co9S8. The Cd3d XPS core level spectra of CdS and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 are presented in Fig. 4 c. The binding energy peaks of Cd3d5/2 and Cd3d3/2 in CdS are found at 404.9 and 411.6 eV, respectively, which well correspond to Cd2+ in CdS [38,39]. These two peaks in the CdS/Co9S8-0.2 photocatalyst show a positive shift of 0.3 eV, which is very similar with the peak shift of S element shown in Fig. 3b. The shift of the binding energy peaks of Cd3d and S2p are due to the transfer of electrons from CdS to Co9S8, which decreases the electron cloud density around the Cd and S atoms in CdS [40,41]. Fig. 3d shows the Co2p XPS core level spectra of Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2. The co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ can be clearly observed after fitting the peaks. The peak area of Co3+ is much smaller than that of Co2+ in Co9S8, while the peak area of Co3+ increases obviously compared with that of Co2+ in CdS/Co9S8-0.2 due to the formation of CdS/Co9S8 heterojunction. Furthermore, the peak positions of Co2+ in CdS/Co9S8-0.2 show slightly negative shifts compared with those in Co9S8, while the peak positions of Co3+ show no obvious shifts. The XPS results indicate that the electrons in CdS tend to flow to Co9S8 when CdS NPs are deposited on the surface of Co9S8 to form the heterojunction. This benefits the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction between CdS and Co9S8. Based on the abovementioned results, a nanoflower-structured Co9S8 hierarchical photocatalyst was successfully prepared using a simple solvothermal method under template-free conditions. Co9S8 acts as a carrier to allow the CdS NPs to be evenly dispersed onto its surface, and a nanoflower-structured CdS/Co9S8 hierarchical heterojunction system is formed. A heterojunction photocatalyst with a hierarchical structure can provide a large number of active sites for the photocatalytic reactions, which is helpful for the rapid progress of the photocatalytic reactions. Fig. 4 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of the prepared photocatalysts. The absorption threshold of pristine CdS is approximately 525 nm. While, Co9S8 displays a strong absorption in the whole scanning spectral range, indicating the strong light collection ability from UV to visible light region [25,27]. For CdS/Co9S8 photocatalysts, the absorption is further enhanced compared with that of Co9S8 in the almost whole scanning spectral range, indicating the establishment of CdS/Co9S8 heterojunction can increase the light absorption and utilization for the photocatalytic reactions. The photocatalytic hydrogen production activities of the prepared photocatalysts under visible light illumination are shown in Fig. 5 . The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CdS and Co9S8 are pretty poor, which can only produce 0.17 mmol and 0.04 mmol hydrogen in 4 h, respectively. While, after depositing CdS NPs on the surface of Co9S8, the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance is significantly increased, and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 possesses the best photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, which can produce 2.32 mmol hydrogen in 4 h. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of the prepared photocatalysts can be intuitively seen in Fig. 5b, and those of CdS, Co9S8, CdS/Co9S8-0.4, CdS/Co9S8-0.3, CdS/Co9S8-0.2 and CdS/Co9S8-0.1 are 0.85, 0.21, 8.10, 10.10, 11.60 and 9.40 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. With the decrease of the added amount of Co9S8, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of CdS/Co9S8 increases firstly and then decreases. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of CdS/Co9S8-0.2 is 13.6 and 55.2 times that of CdS and Co9S8, respectively. When excessive Co9S8 are added, the amount of CdS deposited on the surface of Co9S8 will be less in consideration of the fixed total amount of CdS. In this case, fewer effective CdS/Co9S8 heterojunction reactive sites are formed to be utilized, resulting in the decrease of the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. With the decrease of the added amount of Co9S8, CdS can be fully deposited on the surface of Co9S8, making the hydrogen production efficiency increase and finally to the maximum value. With the further decrease of the added amount of Co9S8, too much CdS NPs will deposit on the surface of Co9S8, which blocks the reactive sites and hinders the effective progress of the photocatalytic hydrogen production reactions. Therefore, by adjusting the added mass of Co9S8, a CdS/Co9S8 heterojunction photocatalyst with the best photocatalytic hydrogen production performance is obtained. The recycling test of the photocatalytic hydrogen production amount was further measured to evaluate the photocatalytic stability of CdS/Co9S8-0.2 and the relevant result is shown in Fig. 5c. The photocatalytic hydrogen production amount of CdS/Co9S8-0.2 was tested for five cycles, and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 shows excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance in each cycle under visible light illumination. After 5-cycle test, CdS/Co9S8-0.2 can still generate 2.34 mmol of hydrogen in 4 h, indicating its high stability in the photocatalytic hydrogen production process. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements were performed to analyze the specific surface area and pore structure distribution of the prepared CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 photocatalysts conform to the type-IV isotherm law, indicating that the prepared photocatalysts contain the slit-shaped mesopore structure [42–44]. As shown in the inserted table in Fig. 6a, the BET surface areas of CdS and Co9S8 are 10.92 and 1.95 m2/g based on calculation, respectively, while that of CdS/Co9S8-0.2 is significantly increased to 27.94 m2/g, which can be due to the sufficient dispersion of CdS on the surface of Co9S8. The largest BET surface area indicates that CdS/Co9S8-0.2 can provide a larger number of reactive sites for the photocatalytic reactions, which benefits the efficient and rapid photocatalytic reactions [45,46]. In addition, the pore-size distributions of CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 6b. All of the prepared photocatalysts exhibit micropores and mesopores from 1 to 75 nm. The main pore-size distribution is concentrated in the range of 2−20 nm, which is conducive to the efficient photocatalytic reaction for the photocatalysts. As shown in the inset in Fig. 6b, the changes of Vpore and dpore indicate the dispersion of CdS NPs on the surface of Co9S8. The Vpore and dpore of CdS/Co9S8-0.2 can be obtained as 0.15 cm3/g and 21.43 nm, respectively. Fig. 6c and d show the photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2. Two strong fluorescence peaks at approximately 550 nm and 770 nm for CdS, and two strong fluorescence peaks at approximately 540 nm and 760 nm for Co9S8 are observed in Fig. 6c, indicating the high recombination rates of the photoinduced electrons and holes generated by CdS and Co9S8. The intensities of the fluorescence peaks of CdS/Co9S8-0.2 are significantly reduced compared with those of CdS and Co9S8, demonstrating that the CdS/Co9S8 heterojunction effectively inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes [47,48]. Fig. 6d shows the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 photocatalysts with a three-exponential fitting method. As shown in Fig. 6d, CdS/Co9S8-0.2 is found to have the longest fluorescence lifetime. The average decay lifetime can be obtained from the three-exponential fitting data, as shown in Table 2 . The average lifetime of CdS and Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 are 4.94, 4.92 and 5.92 ns, respectively, indicating that the photoinduced charge carriers generated by CdS/Co9S8-0.2 has the longest lifetime to participate in the photocatalytic hydrogen production process. The difficulty of the photogenerated electrons escaping from the semiconductor is an important factor affecting the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. The work functions (WFs) of the prepared photocatalysts are measured by SKP, which are used to characterize the difficulty of the photogenerated electrons escaping from the semiconductor. A lower surface voltage indicates a smaller WF and the easier excitation of the electrons, which is conducive to the rapid generation of photogenerated charge carriers and the participation in the photocatalytic reactions [15,49,50]. Figs. 6e shows the surface potential distribution of CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 measured by SKP. CdS/Co9S8-0.2 has the minimum surface potential. In addition, the WFs of CdS, Co9S8 and CdS/Co9S8-0.2 can be calculated to be 4.83, 4.61 and 4.51 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6f. CdS/Co9S8-0.2 has the lowest WF, therefore, its photogenerated charge carriers are the easiest to escape among these three materials and can effectively participate in the photocatalytic reactions, resulting in the significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CdS/Co9S8-0.2. The band structures of CdS and Co9S8 were analyzed by UV–vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4) and Mott-Schottky curves (Fig. 7 ). The band gaps of CdS and Co9S8 the photocatalysts are calculated by the equation αhv = A (hv-Eg)n/2 [51,52], where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck constant, v is light frequency, A is a constant, Eg is the band gap. Fig. 7a and b show the plots of (αhν)2 versus Eg for CdS and Co9S8, from which the Eg of CdS and Co9S8 can be obtained as 2.36 and 1.42 eV, respectively. Mott-Schottky curves were performed to determine the semiconductor type and the flat band potential, and those of CdS and Co9S8 are shown in Fig. 7c and d. The positive slopes indicate that these two materials are both n-type semiconductors. The flat band potential of an n-type semiconductor is approximately equal to its CB potential [53,54]. According to Fig. 7c and d, the CB potentials of CdS and Co9S8 are -0.50 and -0.91 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. Based on the formula of EVB = ECB + Eg [55,56], the valence band (VB) potentials of CdS and Co9S8 can be calculated to be 1.86 and 0.51 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. According to the formula E (SHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + E° (Ag/AgCl) (E° = 0.197 V) [57,58], the CB potentials of CdS and Co9S8 on the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) scale are -0.30 and -0.71 V (vs. SHE), respectively, and the VB potentials of CdS and Co9S8 on the SHE scale are 2.06 and 0.71 V (vs. SHE), respectively. Therefore, the energy band structure of CdS and Co9S8 can be obtained and are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7e, in which the potentials are on the SHE scale. Fig. 8 illustrates the photocatalytic hydrogen production mechanism of the hierarchical CdS/Co9S8 heterojunction photocatalyst. CdS NPs are evenly dispersed on the surface of Co9S8 to form heterojunction. The appropriate energy band structure of CdS and Co9S8 makes them be well matching to form Z-scheme heterojunction system [25,26,29,47]. Under visible light illumination, CdS and Co9S8 can rapidly generate electrons and holes. Driven by the Z-scheme heterojunction electric filed, the photogenerated electrons on the CB of CdS and the photogenerated holes on the VB of Co9S8 will be rapidly recombined. While, the remaining photogenerated holes with strong oxidizability on the VB of CdS and the photogenerated electrons with strong reducibility on the CB of Co9S8 can be quickly and effectively separated, which will oxidize lactic acid into oxidation products and reduce water into hydrogen, respectively. In addition, the hierarchical structure of Co9S8 provides a large number of reactive sites for the photocatalytic hydrogen production reactions, leading to the rapid and efficient hydrogen production by CdS/Co9S8. Thus, the synergistic effect of the hierarchical structure and the Z-scheme heterojunction system can greatly accelerate the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production for CdS/Co9S8, which makes it obtain a high hydrogen yield."
6,Conclusions,"In this work, a simple template-free solvothermal method was used to prepare novel nanoflower-structured Co9S8 hierarchical photocatalyst. Nanoflower-structured CdS/Co9S8 hierarchical Z-scheme heterojunction system was further established by depositing CdS NPs on Co9S8. The CdS/Co9S8 photocatalyst shows significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production performance and stability. Under visible light illumination, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of the CdS/Co9S8 photocatalyst with the best photocatalytic performance can reach 11.60 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 13.6 and 55.2 times that of pure CdS and Co9S8 photocatalysts, respectively. The hierarchical Co9S8 has a strong ability to collect light and can provide a large number of reactive sites for the photocatalytic hydrogen production reactions. The photogenerated electrons can easily escape from the surface of the CdS/Co9S8 photocatalyst to participate in the photocatalytic hydrogen production reactions. Meanwhile, the construction of the CdS/Co9S8 heterojunction significantly inhibits the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes, and increases the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers for the photocatalytic reactions. The synergistic effect of the hierarchical structure and the Z-scheme heterojunction system greatly enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the CdS/Co9S8 photocatalyst, which provides a new idea for the design of a highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production system."
