0,Introduction,"Some algae and photosynthetic bacteria produce hydrogen ( H 2 ) by utilizing light, and some facultative and obligate anaerobes produce H 2 by fermentation. The H 2 production rate by the fermentation process is generally faster than that by the photosynthetic process, but its H 2 yield, moles of H 2 evolution from the consumption of each mole of organic substrate, is much lower [1]. The theoretical yield is 12 mol H 2 / mol glucose, according to the following equation: C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O = 6 CO 2 + 12 H 2 . However, the practical yield is reportedly very low as only 1 mol H 2 / glucose for most H 2 -producing organisms studied so far, such as Enterobacter aerogenes [2], Escherichia coli [3], and Clostridium cellulolyticum [4]. From the evolutionary perspective, the low yield is resulted from the fact that the H 2 -producing microorganisms have developed their metabolic pathways preferentially for cell growth rather than H 2 production [5]. In order to achieve a high H 2 production yield, the cellular metabolic pathways must be redesigned and/or redirected. This requires an extensive analysis and understanding of metabolic pathways and their regulation in the H 2 -producing organisms. The intracellular metabolic fluxes can be estimated using stoichiometric reaction models, mass balances for metabolites, and thermodynamics (biochemical reaction directionality). The metabolic-flux analysis (MFA) method has been widely used for estimating metabolic-pathway fluxes and their variation caused by genetic and environmental perturbations in several microorganisms [6]. It has also been used for developing strategies to maximize the productivity of many metabolites such as organic acids, amino acids, polysaccharide and antibiotics [6,7]. However, the application of MFA to biological H 2 production in order to study the effect of genetic or environmental conditions on H 2 yield or to develop strategies for the optimal H 2 production has been very limited [8]. We have been studying a new H 2 -producing, chemoheterotrophic facultative bacterium Citrobacter amalonaticus Y19 [9–12]. This strain produces H 2 from various carbon sources including carbon monoxide by water–gas shift type of reaction and sugars by anaerobic fermentation. It is a facultative anaerobe having maximum specific growth rate on glucose, 0.76 h - 1 , and produces H 2 in a wide range of pH (5–9) and temperature ( 25 – 40 ∘ C ) . This Y19 has also shown a high volumetric H 2 production rate, 16 mmol H 2 / L h , with a stable production capability during continuous fermentation operation. Therefore, the Y19 strain has a promising potential as a H 2 producer from carbon monoxide and various organic substrates. The purpose of the present study was to estimate the maximum possible H 2 yield in Ci. amalonaticus Y19 and to elucidate the carbon metabolic pathway(s) leading to a high H 2 yield. For this purpose, we conducted batch cultivations under varying initial glucose concentrations while quantitatively measuring major fermentation products. We also constructed an in silico metabolic-flux model for the anaerobic glucose metabolism of Ci. amalonaticus Y19, and analyzed the model using a linear optimization program. Non-native hydrogenase reactions, identified from a metabolic pathways database, were incorporated into the metabolic network to examine their effect on the theoretical H 2 production yield of Y19."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and culture conditions,"2.1 Microorganism and culture conditions Ci. amalonaticus Y19 (Y19) was previously isolated from a sludge digester and designated as Ci. sp. Y19 [9]. In this study, it was re-designated as Ci. amalonaticus Y19 based on 16S rDNA analysis and biochemical characterization. The PFN mineral salt medium [9] fortified with a phosphate buffer (180mM and pH 7.3), 0.1g yeast extract/L (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, USA), and 9.5g glucose/L (Sigma Chemical Co., USA) was used for inoculum culture. For fermentation, glucose was varied in the range of 1.5–9.5g/L while keeping yeast extract constant at 0.3g/L. Anaerobic fermentation experiments were performed in serum bottles (working volume, 50mL in 165mL bottle) using a reciprocating shaker ( 30 ∘ C and 100strokes/min). After inoculation, the bottle was sparged with argon gas (99.999%) for 5min to provide anaerobic condition and then sealed with a 12mm-thick butyl rubber septum and aluminum cap. The inoculum was cultivated in the same bottle and transferred at late-exponential phase using a sterile hypodermic disposable syringe."
3,Analyses,"2.2 Analyses Cell concentrations were measured at 600nm using a spectrophotometer (Lambda 20, Perkin-Elmer, USA). Gas concentrations were determined by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. H 2 was analyzed using a GC column ( 6 ft × 1 / 8 in ) packed with Molecular Sieve 5A (80/100 mesh; Alltech, Deerfield, USA). CO 2 was analyzed using a GC column packed with Hayesep Q (80/100 mesh; Alltech, Deerfield, USA). Various organic acids, ethanol, and glucose in culture broth samples were analyzed using HPLC (1100 series, Agilent Technologies, USA) with a Shodex-SH1011 packed column ( 8 mm × 300 mm ; Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan). A diode array detector was used for quantifying the organic acids and a refractive index detector for quantifying ethanol and glucose, respectively. The organic acids analyzed included succinate, lactate, formate, acetate, propionate, and pyruvate. Other detailed procedures and conditions are described in our earlier reports [11,13]. Biochemical characteristics of Y19 were analyzed using an API 20E kit (bioMrieux, France). The API system is a standardized micro-method for the identification of unknown microorganism and utilizes a plastic strip, which contains dehydrate media and substrates. Test strain is incubated in a strip and identified by referring the reaction results (e.g. color change) to the API database supplied by the manufacturer."
4,In silico model construction and MFA,"2.3 In silico model construction and MFA The anaerobic glucose metabolic network for the Y19 strain was developed from physiological experiments, a KEGG metabolic pathways database [14; http://www.genome.jp/kegg], and literature information from other genera of the enterobacteria such as E. coli and En. aerogenes [2,3,15]. The phosphotransferase system (PTS) was assumed to be functioning in Ci. amalonaticus Y19 for glucose transport. The PTS system is more energy-efficient than the non-PTS system, because the high-energy phosphate group of phosphoenolpyruvate used for the PTS is conserved in glucose-6-phosphate [16]. The metabolic network of Ci. amalonaticus Y19 was constructed to contain 81 reactions: glycolysis, 11; glycogen synthesis, 4; pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, 8; tricarboxylic acid cycle, 10; anaplerotic reactions, 6; pyruvate metabolism, 7; propionate metabolism, 7; energy metabolism, 15; transport reactions, 12; and growth flux, 1. The cellular composition of Ci. amalonaticus Y19 was very similar to that of E. coli and assumed to be the same [17]. Biomass formation (growth flux) was included into the model to account for the drain of precursors and building blocks into biomass. ATP demand for the non-growth-associated maintenance of cells was assumed to be 18.9 mmol / g cell h based on experimental value from E. coli [6]. A list of these selected reactions, enzymes and metabolites, and nomenclature is provided in Appendices A and B. The in silico MFA model used in this study was underdetermined and solved by optimizing a defined objective function [6,7]. In this study, either the specific growth rate or the specific H 2 production rate was chosen as the objective function and these objective functions were maximized during optimization. When the specific growth rate was used as an objective function, the specific rates for glucose uptake and for the production of various extracellular metabolites (lactate, ethanol, acetate, succinate, and formate), which were measured experimentally during exponential cell growth phase of batch culture, were used as the constraints in solving the model. When the specific H 2 production rate was used as an objective function, specific growth rates ( 0 – 0.4 h - 1 ) and/or specific glucose uptake rate (e.g. 12.64 mmol / g cell h obtained with a glucose concentration of 1.5g/L) were used as the constraints in the calculation. The solution at the maximum value of the objective function gave the values of the unknown metabolic-fluxes within the network in the unit of mmol/gcellh. The underdetermined system was solved by linear optimization using the program package MetaFluxNet [18]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Identification of Ci. amalonaticus Y19,"3.1 Identification of Ci. amalonaticus Y19 Ci. amalonaticus Y19 was previously designated as Ci. sp. Y19 based on 16S rDNA analysis and BLAST search [9]. The BLAST search showed that the 16S rDNA sequences of Y19 were 99% identical to those of both Ci. farmeri and Ci. amalonaticus in the GenBank database. In this study, the Y19 strain was further characterized using an API biochemical test kit. Table 1 shows the biochemical characteristics of Y19, Ci. farmeri, and Ci. amalonaticus. Ci. amalonaticus is distinguished from Ci. farmeri in the metabolism of citrate and melibiose, and arginine dihydrolase activity for L-arginine [19]. The former is capable of utilizing citrate as a carbon source and has the arginine dihydrolase activity, whereas the latter ferments melibiose. General biochemical characteristics of Y19 were exactly the same as those of Ci. amalonaticus and, therefore, Y19 was re-designated as Ci. amalonaticus Y19."
7,Fermentation profiles by Ci. amalonaticus Y19,"3.2 Fermentation profiles by Ci. amalonaticus Y19 Fig. 1 shows the time course profiles of glucose fermentation at 9.5gglucose/L. The initial concentration of yeast extract was set at a low level of 0.3g/L for an accurate calculation of carbon material balance. The 0.3g/L yeast extract could support a good cell growth, while keeping the amount of carbon derived from yeast extract negligible compared to the carbon from glucose. In addition to cell mass and H 2 , various metabolites such as CO 2 , ethanol, and organic acids were monitored. Exponential cell growth was observed and the maximum specific growth rate was estimated to be 0.38 h - 1 . The pH gradually decreased from 7.3 to about 6.2 and remained constant thereafter. This pH level does not inhibit H 2 production [11]. The time course profile of H 2 indicates that it is growth-associated. Chromatographic analyses exhibited that lactate, ethanol, acetate, succinate, and formate were the major metabolites during fermentation. H 2 , ethanol, acetate, and succinate gradually increased in a similar trend with the cell from the beginning of fermentation, while lactate showed a little lag during the early cell growth phase. H 2 production reached about 2mmol and remained constant. Formate started to accumulate from the beginning, went through a maximum, decreased slightly, and remained constant after the cell growth stopped. Pyruvate and propionate were also produced but their quantities remained below 0.1mmol. The H 2 yield was estimated as 0.7 mol H 2 / mol glucose. The carbon mass balance on batch cultivation is summarized in Table 2 . The carbon composition of Ci. amalonaticus Y19 was assumed to be about 53.0% [11]. The carbon from yeast extract (carbon content in yeast extract is estimated as 29–36%; [11,20]) was 0.1g/L and assumed to be negligible as compared to the carbon source supplied from glucose at 9.5g/L. The carbon balance is satisfactory as the estimated carbon recoveries against the initial carbon input are about 97.5–100.9%. The fractional carbon distributions in various metabolites are lactate (41.0%), ethanol (19.3%), acetate (11.5%), CO 2 (10.4%), succinate (7.8%), and biomass (5.7%). The fraction of carbon directed to other low carbon metabolites such as propionate, formate, and pyruvate was only about 1.5%. The composition and production profiles of extracellular metabolites from the Y19 are similar to those by other enterobacteria such as E. coli and En. aerogenses [2,3]. In most enterobacteria, H 2 production proceeds via the formate pathway, where formate is split into H 2 and CO 2 by the formate–hydrogen lyase (FHL) complex."
8,In silico model construction and verification,"3.3 In silico model construction and verification The in silico metabolic network of Ci. amalonaticus Y19 was constructed from experimental data (explained in Section 3.2), a KEGG metabolic pathways database [14], and literature information (see Materials and methods for details). Metabolic flux of Y19 during glucose fermentation was analyzed using the metabolic network and the results were compared to experimental results (Table 3 ). In these experiments, glucose concentration was varied in the range of 1.5–9.5g/L, while yeast extract was kept constant at 0.3g/L. Six specific rates data (one for glucose assimilation and five for production of metabolites) were measured during exponential growth phase of batch cultures and used as the constraints in the MFA of metabolic-pathway model. Maximization of specific growth rate was used as an objective function, and specific H 2 production rate was used as the criterion to evaluate the agreement between the in silico MFA and experiments. As shown in Table 3, for all three cases of different glucose concentrations, a very good agreement between the in silico MFA and experiments was observed for the H 2 yields and specific H 2 production rate. However, the experimentally measured specific cell growth rates were about 3 times greater than those values estimated from the in silico MFA. This discrepancy in cell growth rates indicates that the present model is not fully satisfactory. Development of a better in silico model based on extensive cellular reactions and accurate experimental determinations on cellular composition, maintenance energy, glucose uptake system, etc. should be followed. However, it should be pointed out that the method used here was not a model fitting, fractional carbon distribution to cell mass was very low (5.7%; see Table 2), and the composition of Y19 used in in silico MFA was assumed to be the same as that of E. coli. Fig. 2 shows the graphical representation of metabolic-flux calculation of glucose fermentation in Y19 for three different initial glucose concentrations at 9.5, 5.0, and 1.5g/L. Glucose was mainly directed to pyruvate via Embden–Meyerhof (EM) pathway and pyruvate was mostly converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate formate lyase (EC 2.3.1.54) with co-generation of formate. Formate was then split into H 2 and CO 2 by the FHL complex. Succinate was produced via anaplerotic reaction by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31), which was typically observed in most Enterobacteriaceas [21]. Fig. 2 also suggests the absence of α -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase expression and the presence of branched TCA cycle, which are often observed in anaerobic bacteria [22,23]."
9,Incorporation of non-native hydrogenase reaction into metabolic network and MFA for H 2 production in Y19,"3.4 Incorporation of non-native hydrogenase reaction into metabolic network and MFA for H 2 production in Y19 MFA was performed with specific H 2 production rate as an objective function to estimate the maximum H 2 production yield achievable in Y19. The specific glucose uptake rate of 12.64mmol/gcellh (experimentally measured value when glucose concentration used was 1.5g/L) was given as a constraint. MFA revealed that H 2 was exclusively produced by FHL and the H 2 yield in Y19 was 2 mol H 2 / mol glucose (data not shown). This is the theoretical maximum of the H 2 yield which can be achieved by the FHL complex, and confirms again the utility of the present in silico metabolic-flux model [3]. In addition, this result indicates that there is a clear limitation in improving H 2 production yield with the present metabolic network. In order to elucidate the high-yielding pathway for H 2 (e.g. over 2 mol H 2 / mol glucose), a non-native hydrogenase reaction was incorporated in the in silico metabolic network of Y19. Although not present in enterobacteria sp., nine hydrogenases (NAD-linked, EC 1.12.1.2; NADP-linked, EC 1.12.1.3; ferricytochrome c3-linked, EC 1.12.2.1; ferredoxin-linked, EC 1.12.7.2; coenzyme F420-linked; cofactor-unidentified, EC 1.12.99.6; menaquinone-linked, EC 1.12.5.1; 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin-linked, EC 1.12.98.2; 2-(2,3-dihydropentaprenyloxy)phenazine-linked, EC 1.12.98.3) could be identified from the KEGG metabolic pathways database. Among them, NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase was chosen to modify the present network of Y19 since NAD(P)H is a physiological electron carrier in Y19. The NAD-linked hydrogenase is present in a purple sulfur bacterium Thiocapsa roseopersicina and cyanobacteria species, and catalyzes a reaction of NADH to H 2 [24,25]. The NADP-linked hydrogenase uses NADPH as an electron donor for the production of H 2 in anaerobic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus [26]. Fig. 3 shows the optimized metabolic-flux distribution for a genetically modified network of Y19 with a non-native NAD-linked (Fig. 3A) or NADP-linked (Fig. 3B) hydrogenase reaction. The results are significantly different from the one obtained from the wild-type network of Y19 with the specific cell growth rate as an objective function (Fig. 2). Carbon fluxes toward biomass were not observed, and the metabolism was mainly directed to the PP pathway (76–80%) instead of the EM pathway (20–24%). When an NAD-dependent hydrogenase was incorporated (Fig. 3A), NADPH was produced at a very high rate of 87.06mmol/gcellh in the PP pathway and converted to NADH via transhydrogenase. NADH were also generated via glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12) and pyruvate dehydrogenase, and utilized to produce H 2 at a high yield of 8.74 mol H 2 / mol glucose. The ATP (e.g. 18.9mmol/gcellh) necessary for non-growth-associated maintenance of cells was supplied by phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1), and F0F1–ATPase (EC 3.9.3.14). Other metabolite flux except for acetate and propionate was not observed. When the NADP-linked hydrogenase pathway was incorporated into the metabolic network of Y19 (Fig. 3B), metabolic-flux distribution was similar to the one obtained with the incorporation of the NAD-linked hydrogenase except for transhydrogenase activity and formate pathway. NADPH was produced at a rate of 78.13mmol/gcellh in the PP pathway, and then utilized to produce H 2 by the NADP-linked hydrogenase. H 2 was also generated via formate pathway and a high H 2 yield of 8.15 mol H 2 / mol glucose resulted. Although Fig. 3 identifies cellular metabolic-pathways for accomplishing high H 2 yield, the actual realization of these pathways in Y19 and other H 2 -producing bacteria is highly challenging. First of all, the incorporation (namely heterologous expression) of NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase in Y19 is very complicated. Hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that have metal clusters at the active site, and the assembly and insertion of metal cluster into enzymes usually require numerous specific accessory proteins [27]. Therefore, not only target hydrogenase gene(s) but also accessory genes necessary for the maturation of hydrogenase need to be co-expressed. Recently, Posewitz et al. [27] have reported that the heterologous expression of active Chlamydomonas reinhardtii hydrogenase in E. coli is possible when two accessory genes are co-expressed. Another problem is that the H 2 production via the NAD(P)-dependent hydrogenase is thermodynamically unfavorable in the presence of H 2 [3]. One possible solution to this is maintaining low H 2 pressure in bioreactor by continuously sweeping out the produced H 2 by inert gas. As this causes dilution of H 2 in the product stream, the development of efficient H 2 purification process (e.g. membrane) should be followed. MFA to maximize H 2 production using NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase was extended to examine the effect of specific cell growth rate (Fig. 4 ). A specific glucose uptake rate (12.64mmol/gcellh) and varying cell growth rates ( 0 – 0.4 h - 1 ) were used as constraints. As increasing specific cell growth rate, glycolytic pathway-flux for the supply of ATP, precursors, and cofactors required for the generation of biomass increased, whereas metabolic flux via PP pathway and NAD(P)-linked H 2 production yield decreased. This result suggests that specific cell growth rate should be maintained at a low level for efficient H 2 production, as such processes could be carried out by controlling a limiting nutrient (e.g. phosphate or nitrogen) as is done in many industrial fermentation [20]."
10,Conclusion,"The in silico central metabolic-pathway model for anaerobic glucose fermentation was developed for Ci. amalonaticus Y19 based on experimental data and metabolic pathway database. Metabolic-flux analysis showed that, when the specific growth rate of cell was chosen as an objective function, the stoichiometric model could properly predict the phenotypic behavior of Ci. amalonaticus Y19 during H 2 fermentation. MFA also indicated that a high H 2 production yield of 8.7 mol H 2 / mol glucose is possible if glucose metabolism is directed to the PP pathway and NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase is utilized to produce H 2 . This study defines the upper limit of H 2 production in microbial fermentation and suggests the direction of metabolic engineering in microorganisms used for H 2 production."
