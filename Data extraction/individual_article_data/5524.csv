0,Introduction,"As is well-known to us, amino acids are recognized to be essential building blocks of proteins in a variety of food, agriculture and bioscience areas that can be existed in either L- or D-isomer except for the glycine [1,2]. It is reported that D-type amino acids can be employed in inhibiting microbial attachment onto solid surfaces and leading to the separation of mature bio-membrane in the low concentration [2,3]. As one of the non-protein active amino acid found in naturally produced peptides, D-tryptophan (CAS Reg. No. 153-94-6, structure shown in Fig. 1 , IUPAC name (R’)-α-Amino-3-indolepropionic acid) has abundant application value in the fields of food, agriculture and medical industries with special physiological properties [4–6]. The solubility and related thermodynamic parameters of the amino acids like Gibbs energy of transfer are essential in exploring the mechanism of interactions between solvent molecules with bio-macromolecules [7]. In some cases thermodynamic parameters are found to be helpful in characterizing the conformational changes of macromolecules like proteins in solution. This opens a field of investigation on the studies of solvation of amino acids in different solvent systems. Size, shape, charge, hydrogen bonding capability, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, zwitterionic character, chemical reactivity, etc., of an amino acid are seen to govern it in solution which is why a lot of studies are performed to correlate their structural aspects with their solvation individuality [8]. In this way, the knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of proteins as well as amino acids in different solution is necessary. Although many solubility results of several amino acids in neat solvents and solvent mixtures are available in the literatures, a new addition in this area would definitely enrich the region which still remains to be explored. The literatures research discussed the effect of 3rd component (additive) on the water structure around tryptophan [9–12]. The increase in the solubility of tryptophan in water upon addition of various organic compounds was explained on the basis of the following mechanism: such a 3rd component comes in contact with the hydrophobic moiety of tryptophan to result in a simultaneous structural change of the iceberg around that moiety, accompanying an increase of its affinity to water. It was demonstrated that the more hydrophobic the drug, the more it was adsorbed by carbon black from aqueous solution. Although physicochemical properties relating solubility of L-tryptophan and DL-tryptophan in aqueous solutions have been extensively studied [9–13], the physicochemical properties of neat D-tryptophan in aqueous and organic solutions have not been studied so far. So this work tries to give an idea about the relative stabilization of D-tryptophan in aqua-organic mixtures with respect to water and the complex solute–solvent and solvent–solvent interactions therein. In addition, due to the good market prospects, many investigators endeavor to study the production of D-tryptophan. D-tryptophan is usually produced from L-tryptophan by racemization under the basic condition. Obviously, it is rather necessary to separate the two optical isomers of D- and L-tryptophan type by means of efficient methods in order to realize further application. In the cost of D-tryptophan production, the separation and purification hold a large proportion and has become a bottleneck problem. The crude D-tryptophan must be purified via recrystallization in aqueous solutions of alcohols and other organic compounds [5,6,14]. However, to design an optimized process of crystallization, it is necessary to study the thermodynamics the crystallization first. The obtained solubility data enables us to find the most suitable solvent systems to purify various drugs by means of solvent crystallization. An empirical model of solvent effect has been developed by Kamlet and Taft et al. based on a classification of intermolecular interactions and considering their separate contribution to the free energy of solvent-effected change [15]. In this model, known as Kamlet and Taft linear solvation energy relationships, and abbreviated as KAT-LSER, the total energy changes arising from the solvent effect is expressed as a linear summation over all solute-solute, solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions. Intermolecular interactions are considered into two categories: non-specific interactions including dipole-dipole (Keesom), dipole-induced dipole (Debye) and instantaneous induced dipole-dipole (London dispersion), and specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding interactions. The solvent’s ability to participate in such interactions is characterized by introducing three solvatochromic parameters including π*, β and α to scale dipolarity/polarizability, hydrogen-bond basicity and hydrogen-bond acidity of solvent, respectively [15–18]. Since these parameters are determined from direct measurement of energy changes induced by relating solute-solvent interactions, correlation analysis between them and the Gibbs energy of solvent-effected property such as the solubility in the framework of KAT-LSER gives quantitative information on their relative significance and thus on the nature of solvent effect [17,18]. Although several semiempirical and theoretical models may be used to predict solubility of drug in mixed solvents, the availability of experimental solubility data is still fundamental for the pharmaceutical scientists [19]. In addition, solvent mixtures has been widely employed in pharmacies long ago [20]. Recently the mechanisms relating to the decrease or increase in drugs’ solubility start to be studied from a deep thermodynamic point of view, including the analysis of the preferential solvation of solute by the components in mixed solvents [21–23]. For co = solvency approach, solvent selection is a pivotal procedure. Practicable solvents should be thermally stable, nontoxic (environmentally safe), noncorrosive, and commercially available. The frequently used co = solvents in the pharmaceutical fields are methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and so forth [24–27]. Methanol is not used to develop liquid medicines due to its high toxicity. However it is used in drug purification and is widely used as mobile phase in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [28]. Ethanol is a safe and common co-solvent to be used in the pharmaceutical industry due to its high solubilisation capacity [29]. DMF is a very interesting solvent to investigate the interrelation between drug solubility and medium polarity because it is aprotic and completely miscible with water [30]. Isopropanol is a colorless and flammable chemical compound with a strong odour. It is miscible with water, ethanol, ether and chloroform, and dissolves a wide range of non-polar compounds. It is relatively non-toxic, compared to alternative solvents. Isopropanol is used solely or in mixtures with other solvents for different purposes including in penetration-enhancing pharmaceutical compositions for topical transepidermal and percutaneous applications [31]. In terms of the considerations mentioned above, the main goal of this work is to report the equilibrium solubility of D-tryptophan (3) in neat solvents of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, DMF and water, and liquid mixtures of {methanol (1) + water (2)}, {ethanol (1) + water (2)}, {isopropanol (1) + water (2)} and { DMF (1) + water (2)} at temperatures ranging from (283.15 to 333.15) K as well as solvent effect on the solubility and the preferential solvation of D-tryptophan by these organic solvents. This research expands the available solubility data about drug in neat organic solvents and solvent mixtures [24] and also allows the thermodynamic analysis of the respective dissolution and specific solvation process."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials D-Tryptophan was purchased from Aladdin Industrial (Shanghai) Co., Ltd with a mass fraction of 0.980. It was purified three times via crystallization in ethanol. The final content of D-tryptophan employed for solubility determination was 0.995 in mass fraction confirmed by using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In this work, all organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and DMF) used were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China with the mass fraction purity no less than 0.996 determined by gas chromatography (GC, FULI 9790, China). Distilled deionized water (conductivity < 2 μS cm−1) prepared in our laboratory was used throughout the measurement process. The detailed information of these chemicals used in this work was tabulated in Table 1 ."
3,Preparation of binary solvent mixtures,"2.2 Preparation of binary solvent mixtures The solvent mixtures were prepared by using the analytical balance (model: BSA224S) in this experiment. The mixed solvent in the glass vessel was about 15 g, and the standard uncertainty of which was estimated to be 0.0001 g. The mass fractions of water in the aqueous mixtures varied from 0 to 1.0. The glass vessel was covered with a stopper to prevent the solvent from escaping during the preparation process of solvent mixtures at local atmosphere of 101.2 kPa."
4,Solubility measurement,"2.3 Solubility measurement Several solubility determination methods may be found in the Ref. [32]. Here the solid-liquid equilibrium of D-tryptophan in neat solvents and solvent mixtures was attained by the saturation shake-flask method as reported in the literatures [32,33], and the high-performance liquid phase chromatograph (HPLC, Agilent-1260) was employed to determine the solubility of D-tryptophan in equilibrium liquid phase. An excess amount of the solid D-tryptophan was introduced in a 25 mL flask containing the respective solvent system, which was placed in a thermostatic mechanical shaker (standard uncertainty: 0.02 K) provided by Tianjin Ounuo Instrument Co. Ltd., China. The solution was shaken continually by using the mechanical shaker. In order to confirm the equilibration time of the solid–liquid system, about 0.5 mL liquid phase was taken out by using a 2 mL preheated syringe equipped with a pore syringe filter (PTFE 0.2 μm) every one hours and then tested by the high-performance liquid phase chromatograph. The same analytical results indicated that the solution arrived at equilibrium. Analytical results indicated that it took about 14 h to reach equilibrium for all the studied systems. Once the solid–liquid system arrived at equilibrium, the system was retained static at the desired temperature to ensure that all the undissolved solid precipitated from the solution. The upper equilibrium liquid was withdrawn with the 2 mL of preheated or precooled syringe connected with a filter (PTFE 0.2 μm), and transferred quickly into a volumetric flask of 25 mL pre-weighed with the analytical balance (model: BSA224S). The whole amount of the solution and flask was weighed again by using the analytical balance. Then the solution was analysed with the HPLC. The mole fraction solubility of D-tryptophan ( x w,T ) in the mixed solvents are acquired with Eq. (1), and the initial composition of binary solvent mixtures (w) is calculated with Eqs. (2) and (3). (1) x w,T = m 1 / M 1 m 1 / M 1 + m 2 / M 2 + m 3 / M 3 (2) w 1 = w = m 2 m 2 + m 3 (3) w 2 = m 3 m 2 + m 3 where m 1 represents the mass of D-tryptophan, m 2 represents the mass of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and DMF, respectively, and m 3 represents the mass of water. M 1, M 2 and M 3 are the corresponding molar mass."
5,Analysis method,"2.4 Analysis method The concentration of D-tryptophan was analysed by the Agilent-1260 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chromatographic column was a reverse phase column with a type of LP-C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm), which temperature was kept at 303 K. The absorption maxima of the UV detector were set to 278 nm [2]. The mobile phase was neat methanol with a flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1. Each analysis was carried out three times, and the average value of three measurements was regarded as the final value of the analysis. The relative standard uncertainty of the determination was estimated to be 0.025 in mole fraction."
6,X-ray powder diffraction,"2.5 X-ray powder diffraction In order to demonstrate the existence of the polymorph transformation or solvate formation of D-tryptophan during the mutual solubility determination, the equilibrium solid phase was analyzed by XPRD as collected without any further drying. They were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XPRD) carried out on a HaoYuan DX-2700B (HaoYuan, China) instrument. The samples were determined by Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.54184 nm), and the tube voltage and current were set at 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The data were collected at room temperature from 5° to 80° (2-Theta) at a scan speed of 5 deg·min−1 under atmospheric pressure."
7,Results and discussion,
8,XPRD analysis,"3.1 XPRD analysis The patterns of the raw material and the solids crystallized in neat solvents and solvent mixtures are plotted in Fig. S1 of Supporting information. It is confirmed by XRD pattern that all the XPRD patterns of solid phase of D-tryptophan in equilibrium with its solution have the same characteristic peaks with the raw material. Whilst the presence of amorphous phases cannot be ruled out, it can be concluded that there is no possible polymorph transformation or solvate formation during the entire experiment. Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jct.2018.08.018.

9,Experimental solubility,"3.2 Experimental solubility The determined mole fraction solubility (x) of D-tryptophan in methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, DMF and water within the temperature range from (283.15 to 333.15) K are presented in Tables 2–5 , and shown graphically in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that, for a certain neat solvent, the solubilities of D-tryptophan increase with increasing temperature. At the fixed temperature, the mole fraction solubility of D-tryptophan is largest in DMF, and lowest in water. Fig. 2 further illustrates that the dissolving capacity of D-tryptophan in the five solvents are DMF > water > methanol > ethanol > isopropanol. With exception of DMF, this behaviour is the same with the order of solvent polarity. D-tryptophan is slightly polar, so its solubility increases as polarity of solvent increases from isopropanol toward water. Therefore, the polarity seems to be a key factor to affect the D-tryptophan solubility in the selected solvents except for DMF. In addition, D-tryptophan may form H-bonds with DMF with electron donor sites. These H-bonds with the solvent molecules have a direct effect on the solubility. The solubilities of D-tryptophan in DMF are larger than those in the other solvents. The case is obviously due to the formation of H-bonds between the NH2 group of D-tryptophan and (one of) the free electron pairs of the nitrogen atom of DMF. The measured mole fraction solubility of D-tryptophan in binary solvent mixtures of {methanol (1) + water (2)}, {ethanol (1) + water (2)}, {isopropanol (1) + water (2)} and {DMF + water (2)} are listed in Tables 2–5, respectively. The relationship between the mole fraction solubility and temperature and solvent composition are demonstrated graphically in Figs. 3–6 . It can be seen from Tables 2–5 that the D-tryptophan solubility data are a function of temperature and solvent composition for the all solvent mixtures. The mole fraction solubility of D-tryptophan increases with increasing temperature and mass fraction of water for the {methanol (1) + water (2)}, {ethanol (1) + water (2)} and {isopropanol (1) + water (2)} mixtures. However for the aqueous mixtures of DMF, the D-tryptophan solubility increases with increasing mass fraction of DMF. Generally, it is too complicated to elucidate the solubility behaviour presented in Tables 2–5 based on a single reason. The solid solubility in neat solvents and solvent mixtures is governed by the properties of solvents, e.g., hydrogen bond acidity, hydrogen bond basicity and dipolarity/polarizability of the solvent. In order to illustrate the D-tryptophan solubility in the studied mixed solvents, the solute-solvent interactions and solvent-solvent interactions are studied as follows."
10,Solvent effect on the solubility,"3.3 Solvent effect on the solubility KAT-LSER model is used to study the solvent effect on the solubility in this work. According to KAT-LSER, the Gibbs energy of the solubility which is proportional to the natural logarithm of mole fraction solubility, lnx, can be modeled by a linear energetic contributions from various solute-solvent as well as solvent-solvent interactions in a general form of Eq. (4) [15]. (4) In x = c 0 + c 1 π ∗ + c 2 β + c 3 α + c 4 V s δ H 2 100 R T The last term, named as cavity term, accounts for the needed energy to overcome solvent-solvent interactions in order to create voids with suitable size for accommodation of the solute. In this term, V s, δ H, R and T stand for the molar volume of the solute in the liquid form, Hildebrand solubility parameter, the universal gas constant and temperature, respectively. The squared value of δ H Multiplying V s calculates the required energy for cavity formation. This product is divided by R and T to make it dimensionless, and further by 100 to resize it in order to be comparable with other parameters. In Eq. (4), c 0 is the constant containing contributions from the solute-solute interactions and quantifies the intercept value when all solvent descriptors α, β, π* and δ H are zero; c 2 and c 3 quantify the solubility-sensitivity to specific hydrogen bonding solute-solvent interactions due to hydrogen-bond basicity and acidity of the solvent, respectively. Finally, c 1 and c 4 measure the solvent effect arising from the nonspecific electrostatic solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions, respectively. The parameters α, β, π* for (methanol + water), (ethanol + water), (isopropanol + water) and (DMF + water) as a function of composition are taken from literatures [34–36]. However, some discrepancies were found between these data for pure solvents. Therefore, KAT parameters are corrected according to references data for pure solvents [37], and then tabulated in Table S1 of Supporting material. Hildebrand solubility parameters for pure solvents are extracted from Hansen [38]. For binary mixtures, δ H is calculated through ϕ1δH1 + ϕ2δH2 ; here ϕ i and δ Hi is volume fraction and Hildebrand solubility parameter for pure solvent i in the mixture [21]. These parameters are also tabulated in Table S1 of Supporting material. A value of Vs = 151.38 cm3∙mol−1 is calculated from the molar mass divided by the density of D-tryptophan [39].

KAT-LSER model is examined on experimental solubility data of D-tryptophan in binary solvent mixtures of (methanol + water), (ethanol + water), (isopropanol + water) and (DMF + water) by implementation of the multiple linear regression analysis, MLR. A set of four single-parametric, six dual-parametric, four triple-parametric and one four-parametric KAT-LSER models are obtained from various combination of three KAT parameters and cavity term for each binary mixtures. The results of MLR analysis on this set of equations are tabulated in Tables S2–S5 of Supporting material. The best expression of KAT-LSER is judged on the basis of both physical and statistical validation of coefficients. From the physical point of view, any interaction between the solute and solvent gives rise to positive contribution to the solubility equilibrium; thus coefficients attributed to KAT terms α, β and π* capture positive sign in LSER model. In contrast, for the cavity term, since system requires to spent energy to disrupt solvent-solvent interactions for solute accommodation; a negative coefficient is expected. Therefore, only KAT-LSER models with positive c i=1,2,3 and negative c 4 are valid; and the others are rejected. Then, amongst the remainders, the best is statistically identified as that that maximizes F-statistic and squared correlation coefficient, r 2, and minimizes standard deviations [40]. The best descriptive models are shown by bolded terms in Tables S2–S5 of Supporting material.

The best descriptive models are shown by bolded terms in Tables S2–S5 of Supporting material. Table S2 indicates that all of KAT parameters α, β and π* are significant on the solubility of D-tryptophan in water + methanol mixtures. It means both specific and non-specific solute-solvent interactions explain the solvent effect in this case, however the main effect is attributed to later; coefficient analysis reveals that α, β and π* contribute, respectively, by (11, 32 and 57) % to the solubility variation. This result agrees with physicochemical properties of the solute. D-Tryptophan is slightly polar and as well as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. The main effect of dipolarity/polarizability of solvent is also evident in single-parametric models where correlation only with π* as sole variable gives excellent fitting, r 2 = 0.99, with a high F = 618.58. In regard to specific hydrogen bonding interactions, results indicate that D-tryptophan participates as a stronger hydrogen bond donor than acceptor. From Tables S3 and S4, significant contribution is only observed from π* to the solubility in {water + ethanol (isopropanol)} mixtures. A lack of validate effect of α and β may indicates that molecules of two solvents prefer to form hydrogen bonding interactions with each other rather than with the solute. Results for water + DMF mixtures in Table S5 reveals that the solvent effect on the solubility is best described by a combined role of π* and cavity term. The ratio of coefficients says that cavity term and π* explain respectively 78% and 22% of the solubility variation in aqueous solution of DMF. A close inspection of single parametric KAT-LSER models is also informative. As evident it reveals that β presents solely very good correlation with the solubility variation in such mixtures, however its lack in the best fitted model may indicates that specific solvent-solvent interactions predominant over specific solute-solvent interactions.

11,Thermodynamic modelling,"3.4 Thermodynamic modelling The thermodynamic correlation models employed to describe the equilibrium solubility in solvent mixtures have been completely reviewed in literatures [19,24]. In this work, three thermodynamic models are used to correlate the solubility of D-tryptophan in binary aqueous mixtures of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and DMF at various temperatures namely Jouyban–Acree model, a combination of the Jouyban–Acree model with Van’t Hoff equation and a combination of the Jouyban–Acree model with modified Apelblat equation. The Jouyban-Acree model describing as Eq. (5) may provide accurate mathematical description for the dependence of solute solubility on both temperature and solvent composition for binary and ternary mixed solvents [19,24]. (5) ln x w,T = w 1 ln x 1,T + w 2 ln x 2,T + w 1 w 2 T / K ∑ i = 0 2 J i w 1 - w 2 i where x w,T denotes the mole fraction solubility of D-tryptophan in solvent mixtures at absolute temperature T; w 1 and w 2 are the mass fraction of solvents 1 (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and DMF) and 2 (water) in the absence of the solute (D-tryptophan), respectively; x 1,T and x 2,T are the D-tryptophan solubility in mole fraction in neat solvents; and Ji are the Jouyban-Acree model parameters. In order to obtain the model parameters, the model requires the solute solubility in neat solvent at the highest and lowest temperatures. Combining the Van’t Hoff equation and Jouyban-Acree model expressed as Eq. (5), the Van’t Hoff-Jouyban-Acree model can be obtained and as Eq. (6) [19]. (6) ln x w,T = w 1 A 1 + B 1 T / K + w 2 A 2 + B 2 T / K + w 1 w 2 T / K ∑ i = 0 2 J i ( w 1 - w 2 ) i A1 , B1 , A2 , B2 are Van’t Hoff equation parameters. By substituting the modified Apelblat equation [19,24] into Eq. (5), the modified Apelblat-Jouyban-Acree model is obtained. (7) ln x w,T = w 1 A 1 + B 1 T / K + C 1 ln ( T / K ) + w 2 ( A 2 + B 2 T / K + C 2 ln ( T / K ) + w 1 w 2 T / K ∑ i = 0 2 J i ( w 1 - w 2 ) i The experimental solubility of D-tryptophan in the selected solvent mixtures is correlated and calculated with Eqs. (5)–(7). The objective function is expressed as (8) F = ∑ i = 1 ln x i e - ln x i c 2 In addition, in order to evaluate the selected models, the relative average deviation (RAD) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) are employed and described as Eqs. (9) and (10). (9) RAD = 1 N ∑ x w,T c - x w,T e x w,T e (10) RMSD = ∑ i = 1 N ( x w,T c - x w,T e ) 2 N where N is the number of experimental data points. x w,T e denotes the mole fraction solubility determined in this work; and x w,T c , the mole fraction solubility calculated with the corresponding solubility model. Based on the experimental solubility values, parameters in Eqs. (5)–(7) can be calculated by the Mathcad software. The achieved values of model parameters are listed in Table S6 of Supporting material, together with the RAD and the RMSD values. The solubility of D-tryptophan in aqueous solutions of (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and DMF) is evaluated. The calculated solubilities by using the Jouyban–Acree model are shown graphically in Figs. 3–6. Table S6 shows that for the selected aqueous solutions, the maximum value of RAD between the calculated and experimental values is 1.65%, which is obtained with the Apelblat-Jouyban-Acree model for the system of (isopropanol + water). Besides, the RMSD are no greater than 9.40 × 10−5. In total, the selected thermodynamic models can all be employed to correlate the solubility of D-tryptophan in the co-solvent mixtures at all composition ranges, and the Jouyban-Acree model provides better correlation results.

12,Dissolution property,"3.5 Dissolution property During the dissolution process, thermodynamic properties of solute dissolved in solvent mixtures can provide important information. The standard dissolution enthalpy ( Δ H sol o ) for dissolution process of D-tryptophan in solvent mixtures can be obtained from the famous Van’t Hoff analysis [41]. (11) Δ H sol o = - R ∂ ln x m,T ∂ ( 1 / T ) p = - R ∂ ln x m,T ∂ ( 1 / T ) - ( 1 / T hm ) p here R is the universal gas constant having a value of 8.314 J K−1 mol−1. T hm is the mean harmonic temperature obtained via Eq. (12). (12) T hm = N ∑ i = 1 N 1 T i The Δ H sol o values could be achieved from the slope of the curves of lnx m,T versus (1/T − 1/T hm). Figs. S2–S5 of Supporting material present the curves of lnx m,T ∼ (1/T − 1/T hm) for D-tryptophan dissolved in the aqueous solvent mixtures of (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and DMF). The standard dissolution enthalpy of D-tryptophan in each solvent mixture are computed from Eq. (11) and tabulated in Table S7 of Supporting material. The positive dissolution enthalpy for D-tryptophan mixing with the studied solvent mixtures demonstrates that the cross associating intermolecular interactions formed between solute D-tryptophan and the solvents are weaker than the self-associating interactions, which result in an endothermic solution process.

13,Preferential solvation of D-tryptophan,"3.6 Preferential solvation of D-tryptophan In binary solvent mixtures such as methanol (1) + water (2), ethanol (1) + water (2), isopropanol (1) + water (2) and DMF (1) + water (2), the preferential solvation parameter of D-tryptophan (compound 3) by the solvent (1) in solvent (1) + water (2) mixtures is defined as [21-23]: (13) δ x 1 , 3 = x 1 , 3 L - x 1 = - δ x 2 , 3 where x 1 , 3 L is the local mole fraction of solvent (1) in the environment near to D-tryptophan (3) and x 1 is the bulk mole fraction composition of solvent (1) in the initial binary solvent. The δx 1,3 parameter represents the excess or deficiency of solvent of the solvent mixtures in the local region. When the solute is preferentially solvated by methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or DMF (1), δx 1,3 > 0; while when δx 1,3 is < 0, the solute is said to be preferentially solvated by water (2). Nevertheless, when |δx 1,3| < 0.01, the preferential solvation process is negligible, but if x 1,3 L ≈ 1 , then complete solvation of the solute is performed by the methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or DMF (1). The required parameter δx 1,3 in solvent (1) + water (2) system can be obtained from the inverse Kirkwood–Buff integrals (IKBI) for the individual solvent components analyzed according to some thermodynamic quantities as shown in the following equations [21–23]: (14) δ x 1 , 3 = x 1 x 2 G 1 , 3 - G 2 , 3 x 1 G 1 , 3 + x 2 G 2 , 3 + V cor with (15) G 1 , 3 = R T κ T - V 3 ¯ + x 2 V 2 ¯ D Q (16) G 2 , 3 = R T κ T - V 3 ¯ + x 1 V 1 ¯ D Q (17) V cor = 2522.5 r 3 + 0.1363 x 1,3 L V ¯ 1 + x 2,3 L V 2 ¯ 1 / 3 - 0.085 3 In these equations V ¯ 1 and V ¯ 2 are the partial molar volumes of the solvents in the mixtures; similarly, V ¯ 3 is the partial molar volume of D-tryptophan in these mixtures. The function D {Eq. (18)} is the derivative of the standard molar Gibbs energies of transfer of D-tryptophan from neat water (2) to solvent (1) + water (2) mixtures with respect to the solvent composition. The function Q {Eq. (19)} involves the second derivative of the excess molar Gibbs energy of mixing of the two solvents ( G 1 + 2 Exc ) with respect to the water proportion in the mixtures. V cor is the correlation volume and r 3 is the molecular radius of D-tryptophan calculated by means of Eq. (20) with N Av as the Avogadro’s number. (18) D = ∂ Δ tr G ( 3 , 2 → 1 + 2 ) o ∂ x 1 T,P (19) Q = R T + x 1 x 2 ∂ 2 G 1 + 2 Exc ∂ x 2 2 T,p (20) r 3 = 3 × 10 21 V 3 ¯ 4 π N AV 3 κ T is the isothermal compressibility of solvent (1) + water (2) mixtures (in GPa−1). Due to the small contribution of RTκ T to the inverse Kirkwood-Buff integral, the dependence of κ T on composition will be calculated approximated considering additive behaviour from individual isothermal compressibility of components according to the following equation [21–23]. (21) κ T = x 1 κ T,1 o + x 2 κ T,2 o here xi is the mole fraction of component i in the mixture and κ T,i o is the isothermal compressibility of the neat solvent i. The values of RTκ T in solvent (1) + water (2) mixtures are calculated using Eq. (21) with the reported κ T,i o values for methanol (1.248 GPa−1), ethanol (1.153 GPa−1), isopropanol (1.332 GPa−1), DMF (0.653 GPa−1) and water (0.457 GPa−1) at 298.2 K [42], taken as independent of the temperature [21]. The standard molar Gibbs energy of transfer of D-tryptophan from neat water (2) to methanol (1) + water (1), ethanol (1) + water (1), isopropanol (1) + water (1) and DMF (1) + water (2) mixtures is computed from the solubility data via Eq. (22) and is tabulated in Tables S8 and S9 of Supporting material at five temperatures. These values are shown in Fig. S6 of Supporting material. The standard molar Gibbs energy of transfer of D-tryptophan from neat water (2) to methanol (1) + water (1), ethanol (1) + water (1), isopropanol (1) + water (1) and DMF (1) + water (2) mixtures is computed from the solubility data via Eq. (22) and is tabulated in Tables S8 and S9 of Supporting material at five temperatures. These values are shown in Fig. S6 of Supporting material. (22) Δ tr G 3,2 → 1 + 2 0 = R T ln x 3,2 x 3,1 + 2 The values of Δ tr G 3,2 → 1 + 2 0 are correlated according to the equation presented as Eq. (23) for the alcohol (1) + water (2) mixtures and Eq. (24) for the DMF (1) + water (2) mixtures.

(23) and A 0, A 1, A2 , t 1 and t2 in Eq. (24) are equation parameters. The obtained equation coefficients are shown in Table S10 of Supporting material. Thus, D values are calculated from the first derivative of Eqs. (23) and (24) solved according to the solvent mixture composition varying by 0.05 in mole fraction of solvent (1). The obtained D values are reported in Table S11 of Supporting material. here a, b, c, d, e and f in Eq. (23) and A 0, A 1, A2 , t 1 and t2 in Eq. (24) are equation parameters. The obtained equation coefficients are shown in Table S10 of Supporting material. Thus, D values are calculated from the first derivative of Eqs. (23) and (24) solved according to the solvent mixture composition varying by 0.05 in mole fraction of solvent (1). The obtained D values are reported in Table S11 of Supporting material. The excess molar Gibbs energies of mixing G 1 + 2 Exc are usually reported at 298.15 K for DMF (1) + water (2) and isopropanol (1) + water (2) mixtures [21]. In this way, it is necessary to compute these values at the other temperatures required. Values of G 1 + 2 Exc (J·mol−1) at 298.15 K are calculated according Eqs. (25) and (26) for the DMF (1) + water (2) and isopropanol (1) + water (2) solvent mixtures [21]. On the other hand, the G 1 + 2 Exc values at other temperatures are calculated using Eq. (27), where H 1 + 2 Exc represents the excess molar enthalpy of the solvent mixtures, T 1 is 298.15 K, and T 2 is the temperature under consideration. Values of H 1 + 2 Exc for DMF (1) + water (2) and isopropanol (1) + water (2) mixtures (expressed as Eqs. (28) and (29) are taken from Ref. [21]. (25) G 1 + 2 Exc = x 1 ( 1 - x 1 ) - 978 - 653 ( 1 - 2 x 1 ) + 222 ( 1 - 2 x 1 ) 2 (26) G 1 + 2 Exc = x 1 ( 1 - x 1 ) 3843 - 984 ( 1 - 2 x 1 ) - 98 ( 1 - 2 x 1 ) 2 (27) G 1 + 2 Exc ( T 2 ) = G 1 + 2 Exc ( T 1 ) - T ∫ T 1 T 2 H 1 + 2 Exc d 1 T ≈ T 2 T 1 G 1 + 2 Exc ( T 1 ) + H 1 + 2 Exc 1 - T 2 T 1 (28) H 1 + 2 Exc = x 1 ( 1 - x 1 ) - 7616 + 7751 ( 1 - 2 x 1 ) - 1904 ( 1 - 2 x 1 ) 2 (29) H 1 + 2 Exc = x 1 ( 1 - x 1 ) 854 + 5167 ( 1 - 2 x 1 ) - 7243 ( 1 - 2 x 1 ) 2 In a similar manner, the partial molar volumes of both solvents in the mixtures are calculated from the reported density values of the solvent mixtures at the studied temperatures under study by Bernal-García for DMF + water mixtures [43] and by Pang for isopropanol + water mixtures [44] using Eqs. (30) and (31). In these equations V is the molar volume of the mixtures calculated as V = (x 1·M 1 + x 2·M 2)/ρ. Here, M 1 is 73.09 g mol–1 for DMF, 60.06 g mol–1 for isopropanol and M 2 is 18.01 g mol–1 for water. (30) V 1 ¯ = V + x 2 dV d x 1 (31) V 2 ¯ = V - x 1 dV d x 1 Because no partial molar volumes of D-tryptophan (3) in these mixtures are acquired in the literatures, this property is considered as similar to that in water as a good approximation. From this volume value, solute radius value (r3) is calculated by using Eq. (20) as 0.391 nm. In addition, the RTκ T values and the partial molar volumes of both solvents in the methanol + water and ethanol + water mixtures as well as the Q values at the studied temperatures have been presented in Ref. [23]. Therefore, the values of G 1,3 and G 2,3 in the four binary solvent mixtures can be obtained and shown in Tables S12–S15 of Supporting material. It can be seen that the G 1,3 and G 2,3 values are negative in all cases. This behaviour shows that D-tryptophan exhibit affinity for the solvents in these mixtures.

The iterated values of correlation volume V cor and δx 1,3 are tabulated in Tables S16–S19 of Supporting material for D-tryptophan in methanol (1) + water (1), ethanol (1) + water (1), isopropanol (1) + water (1) and DMF (1) + water (1) solvent mixtures, respectively. Furthermore, the plots of δx 1,3 values versus solvent (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and DMF) compositions is shown graphically in Fig. 7 . It demonstrates that the dependence of δx 1,3 values on the solvent (1) proportion in the solvent mixtures is non-linear. According to Fig. 7, for the alcohol (1) + water (2) mixtures, addition of solvent makes positive the δx 1,3 values of D-tryptophan (3) from the neat water to the mixture up to composition x 1 = 0.30 for methanol (1) + water (2) mixtures, x 1 = 0.25 for ethanol (1) + water (2) mixtures and x 1 = 0.20 for isopropanol (1) + water (2) mixtures. However the absolute values of δx 1,3 are lower than 1.0 × 10−2, the result is a consequence of the effect of uncertainties propagation rather than the preferential solvation [45]. In the methanol (1) + water (2) mixtures with composition 0.30 < x 1 < 1.00, ethanol (1) + water (2) mixtures with composition 0.25 < x 1 < 1.00 and isopropanol (1) + water (2) mixtures with composition 0.20 < x 1 < 1.00, the local mole fractions of alcohol are smaller than those of the mixtures and therefore the δx 1,3 values are negative, which indicates that D-tryptophan is preferentially solvated by water. Probably the structuring of water molecules around the nonpolar aromatic group of D-tryptophan (i.e. aromatic ring group) contributes to lowering of the net δx 1,3 to negative values in the alcohol (1) + water (2) mixtures. Maximum negative values are attained in the mixture x 1 = 0.65–0.70 with δx 1,3 = −1.175 × 10−2 to −1.071 × 10−2 for methanol (1) + water (2), δx 1,3 = − 3.974 × 10−2 to − 3.424 × 10−2 for ethanol (1) + water (2), and δx 1,3 = −21.64 × 10−2 to −17.08 × 10−2 for isopropanol (1) + water (2) mixtures, respectively. It can also be found from Fig. 7(d) that for the DMF (1) + water (2) mixtures, the absolute values of δx 1,3 are all lower than 1.0 × 10−2 over the whole composition range from 0 to 1. The D-tryptophan is preferentially solvated neither by DMF nor by water. The iterated values of correlation volume V cor and δx 1,3 are tabulated in Tables S16–S19 of Supporting material for D-tryptophan in methanol (1) + water (1), ethanol (1) + water (1), isopropanol (1) + water (1) and DMF (1) + water (1) solvent mixtures, respectively. Furthermore, the plots of δx 1,3 values versus solvent (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and DMF) compositions is shown graphically in Fig. 7 . It demonstrates that the dependence of δx 1,3 values on the solvent (1) proportion in the solvent mixtures is non-linear. According to Fig. 7, for the alcohol (1) + water (2) mixtures, addition of solvent makes positive the δx 1,3 values of D-tryptophan (3) from the neat water to the mixture up to composition x 1 = 0.30 for methanol (1) + water (2) mixtures, x 1 = 0.25 for ethanol (1) + water (2) mixtures and x 1 = 0.20 for isopropanol (1) + water (2) mixtures. However the absolute values of δx 1,3 are lower than 1.0 × 10−2, the result is a consequence of the effect of uncertainties propagation rather than the preferential solvation [45]. In the methanol (1) + water (2) mixtures with composition 0.30 < x 1 < 1.00, ethanol (1) + water (2) mixtures with composition 0.25 < x 1 < 1.00 and isopropanol (1) + water (2) mixtures with composition 0.20 < x 1 < 1.00, the local mole fractions of alcohol are smaller than those of the mixtures and therefore the δx 1,3 values are negative, which indicates that D-tryptophan is preferentially solvated by water. Probably the structuring of water molecules around the nonpolar aromatic group of D-tryptophan (i.e. aromatic ring group) contributes to lowering of the net δx 1,3 to negative values in the alcohol (1) + water (2) mixtures. Maximum negative values are attained in the mixture x 1 = 0.65–0.70 with δx 1,3 = −1.175 × 10−2 to −1.071 × 10−2 for methanol (1) + water (2), δx 1,3 = − 3.974 × 10−2 to − 3.424 × 10−2 for ethanol (1) + water (2), and δx 1,3 = −21.64 × 10−2 to −17.08 × 10−2 for isopropanol (1) + water (2) mixtures, respectively. It can also be found from Fig. 7(d) that for the DMF (1) + water (2) mixtures, the absolute values of δx 1,3 are all lower than 1.0 × 10−2 over the whole composition range from 0 to 1. The D-tryptophan is preferentially solvated neither by DMF nor by water. On the basis of a structural and functional group analysis, D-tryptophan can act as a Lewis base in solution due to the free electron pairs in nitrogen atoms of –NH2 and >NH, which interact with acidic hydrogen atoms of water. According to the preferential solvation results, it is conjecturable that in the region of 0.30 < x 1 < 1.00 for methanol, 0.25 < x 1 < 1.00 for ethanol and 0.20 < x 1 < 1.00 for isopropanol, D-tryptophan is acting as a Lewis base, because the Kamlet–Taft hydrogen bond donor parameters are, α = 1.17 for water, 0.98 for methanol, 0.86 for ethanol and 0.76 for isopropanol, respectively [42], being water more acidic than methanol, ethanol and isopropanol."
14,Conclusion,"The equilibrium solubility of D-tryptophan in aqueous solutions of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and DMF with various compositions was acquired experimentally by means of the saturation shake-flask method in the temperature range of (283.15 to 333.15) K under atmospheric pressure. The maximum solubility of D-tryptophan is observed in neat water for the alcohol (1) + water (2) mixtures, and in neat DMF for DMF (1) + water (2) mixture. The dependence of D-tryptophan solubility on temperature and solvent composition was correlated with the Jouyban-Acree model, Van’t Hoff-Jouyban-Acree model and Apelblat-Jouyban-Acree model. The values of RAD (×10−2) and RMSD (×10−5) were no more than 1.65 and 9.40, respectively. The Jouyban-Acree model was more suitable for correlation of D-tryptophan behaviour in solvent mixtures. The dissolution process of D-tryptophan in solvent solutions was endothermic for the dissolution process. Linear solvation energy relationships were employed to study the variation in the solubility in terms of the solvent effect. Quantitative values relating to the local mole fraction of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or DMF and water around D-tryptophan were derived based on the IKBI method at several temperatures. For the methanol (1) + water (2), ethanol (1) + water (2) and isopropanol (1) + water (2) mixtures in intermediate and alcohol-rich composition, D-tryptophan is preferentially solvated by the water; whereas in DMF + water mixture, the D-tryptophan is preferentially solvated neither by water nor by DMF."
