0,Introduction,"International diabetes federation recent estimates indicate that globally 8.3% of adults are living with diabetes and the number of people with diabetes is set to rise beyond 592 million in less than 25 years [1]. A further 175 million of cases are currently undiagnosed and vast amount of people with diabetes are progressing toward complications [1]. Diabetes is recognized to be associated with all aspects of sexual dysfunction in men and women [2,3]. Recent, Nation-wide community-based cross-sectional study on diabetes in Sri Lanka indicated significantly higher prevalence of sexual dysfunction among men and women with diabetes than those without [4], which are in agreement with earlier reports [2,5]. It has been estimated that at least about 35–75% of men with diabetes will experience at least a minimum degree of sexual impotence during their lifetime [6]. Production of surplus amounts of ROS stands a prominent cause for sexual dysfunction in diabetic men [7] besides compromised androgen biosynthesis [8]. Consumption of alcoholic beverages is associated with boisterous behavior at sporting events besides relaxation, reflection, celebration, conviviality, and a certain amount of dry humor. Chronic alcohol intake is associated with multiple health problems including elevation of lipid peroxides and free radicals [9]. Alcohol consumption also results in both endocrine and reproductive failure [10,11]. Prolonged alcohol abuse in men is also known to cause reduction in seminal volume, sperm concentration, percentage of motile spermatozoa, testosterone deficiency, and testicular atrophy, which can lead to impotence, sterility, and feminization [12,13]. Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with increased risk of diabetes [14] and also associated with liver dysfunction [15]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals are formed in both physiologic and pathologic conditions. In small concentrations, ROS enhance physiological and cellular function and in excess concentrations, however, they cause havoc in cells. It has been shown that hyperglycemia induce ROS generation resulting oxidative stress. This oxidative stress is related to the antioxidant defense system, and overall balance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants is required to maintain cellular homeostasis. A role of ROS in infertility due to defective sperm function has been reported [16,17]. Depletion of antioxidant enzymes is thought to be associated with sperm immotility [18]. The complications of diabetes and alcohol have long associated with oxidative stress. Although the individual effects of diabetes and alcohol treatment on oxidative status and reproduction have been well documented but their combined effect has not been studied so far in detailed. Interest in combined effect of stressors has dramatically been increased in recent years. There are increased incidences of diabetes and ever increasing alcohol consumption in many countries including India. Thus the collective burden of diabetes and alcohol consumption in the society is a real possibility and may thus be potentially hazardous to humans. In our prior study, the effects of restraint stress on alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction were examined [19]. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of alcohol on diabetes-induced oxidative toxicity and sexual dysfunction in adult male Wistar rats."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Streptozotocin (STZ), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, NAD and NADPH were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). Thiobarbituric acid was obtained from Merck-Schuchardt, Germany. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and obtained from local commercial sources."
3,Experimental animals and maintenance,"2.2 Experimental animals and maintenance Adult male Wistar strain albino rats (12 weeks old, weighing 180±14g) were purchased from an authorized vendor (M/S Raghavendra Enterprises, Bengaluru, India) and used for all experiments. Animals were housed in clean polypropylene cages, having four rats per cage, and maintained under controlled conditions (27±2°C and a 12h light/dark cycle). The rats were given a standard pellet diet (purchased from HLL Animal Feed, Bengaluru, India) and water ad libitum throughout the experimental period. All the experiments were carried out under controlled conditions according to the guidelines and protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (Regd. No. 438/01/a/CPCSEA/dt.17.07.2001). 2.2.1 Experimental design A total of 40 rats were divided into four groups, ten rats in each group, treated as follows: Group I. Control (C): This group of rats received single i.p. injection of 100μl citrate buffer. Group II: STZ-induced diabetic rats. Group III: Alcohol treated rats. Group IV: diabetic rats treated with alcohol. 2.2.2 Induction of diabetes using STZ and treatment with alcohol Overnight-fasted adult male Wistar rats were rendered diabetic via a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a freshly prepared solution of streptozotocin (STZ) (50mg/kg bw) dissolved in 0.1M cold citrate buffer (pH 4.5), since citrate buffer in known to have no effect on animal's growth and health [19]. The rats were allowed to drink 10% glucose solution overnight to overcome drug-induced hypoglycemia. Rats in control group received citrate buffer (i.p.). Diabetes was confirmed by the presence of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss and only animals exhibiting blood glucose levels above 300mg/dL on the third day following STZ injection were considered as diabetics. Treatment with the alcohol was started on the third day following STZ injection which was considered day one. Alcohol was administered orally as 20% ethanol solution at the dose of 2g/kg.bw via orogastric tube for 55 consecutive days. Animals were continuously monitored for behavioral (alertness, restlessness, irritability, vomiting, and fearfulness), neurological (spontaneous activity, convulsion, gait, bleeding orifices, and touch/pain response), and autonomic (defecation, micturition) changes."
4,Collection of blood and isolation of tissues,"2.3 Collection of blood and isolation of tissues After completion of the experimental period (55 days), the rats were fasted overnight, weighed and sacrificed by using overdose of anesthetic ether followed by cervical dislocation. Blood samples from the control and treatment rats were withdrawn by cardiac puncture and blood glucose levels were determined by using glucose oxidase-peroxidase reactive strips. Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000rpm for 15min after overnight storage at 4°C. The serum samples were stored at −20°C in microfuge tubes and were used for analyzing the level of hormones. Testes, cauda epididymidis, seminal vesicles, vas deferens and ventral prostate were immediately harvested, washed with ice-cold saline, and weighed to the nearest milligram. The tissue somatic index (TSI) was determined by the following formula: TSI = weight of the tissue in grams weight of body in grams × 100 . Testes were used for determination of daily sperm production and biochemical studies and cauda epididymis were used for determination of sperm count, motile, viable and HOS-tail coiled sperm and biochemical studies."
5,Sperm analysis,"2.4 Sperm analysis Daily sperm production was determined in the testes of adult rats by the method of Blazak et al. [20]. In brief, the testis was decapsulated and the parenchyma was homogenized in 50mL of ice-cold 0.9% sodium chloride solution containing 0.01% Triton X 100 using a glass Teflon® homogenizer. The homogenate was filtered through a metal sieve to remove connective tissue, and the filtrate was used to count the number of homogenization-resistant spermatids/sperm using a Neubauer haemocytometer. The number of sperm produced per gram of testicular tissue per day was calculated [21]. Sperm were collected from the right tail of the epididymis in 2.0mL of M-199 medium with 5mg/mL bovine serum albumin. Sperm count and evaluation of the motility were done by the method of Belsey et al. [22]. Sperm count was expressed in millions/mL and motility was expressed as percentage of motile sperm of the total sperm counted. The ratio of live and dead spermatozoa was determined using 1% trypan blue reagent [23]. Sperm viability was expressed as percentage of unstained sperm of the total sperm counted. The hypoosmotic swelling (HOS) test was performed following the method described by Jeyendran et al. [24]. The data were expressed as millions/mL for sperm count, and for other sperm parameters, the data were expressed as percentage of total sperm."
6,Sub-cellular fractionation of testis and epididymis,"2.5 Sub-cellular fractionation of testis and epididymis Microsomal-rich fractions of the testis and epididymis were obtained by the differential centrifugation method [25]. Briefly, a 20% (w/v) homogenate was prepared in ice-cold 0.25M sucrose solution with the help of a motor-driven glass teflon homogenizer. The microsomal-rich pellet was prepared by the calcium chloride (CaCl2) sedimentation method. The microsomal-rich fractions were used for biochemical studies. 2.5.1 Lipid peroxidation levels Lipid peroxidation was determined by estimating the level of thiobarbuturic acid reactive substances (TBARS) measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) according to the method of Ohkawa et al. [26]. Briefly, the stock solution contained equal volumes of trichloroacetic acid 15% (w/v) in 0.25N hydrochloric acid and 2-thiobarbituric acid 0.37% (w/v) in 0.25N hydrochloric acid. One volume of the test sample and two volumes of stock reagent were mixed in a screw-capped centrifuge tube, vortexed and heated for 15min on a boiling water bath. After cooling on ice the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 1000× g for 15min and absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532nm against blank containing all the reagents except test sample. A standard curve was constructed extrapolating the amount to the measured absorbance. 2.5.2 Superoxide dismutase Superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) was assayed by the method of Marklund and Marklund [27]. Briefly, the assay mixture contained 2.4mL of 50mM Tris–HCl buffer containing 1mM EDTA (pH 7.6), 300μl of 0.2mM pyrogallol and 300μl enzyme source. The increase in absorbance was measured immediately at 420nm against blank containing all the components except the enzyme and pyrogallol at 10s intervals for 3min. The activity of enzyme was expressed in nmol pyrogallol oxidized/mg protein/min. 2.5.3 Catalase Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) was assayed by the method of Claiborne [28]. Briefly, the assay mixture contained 2.40mL of phosphate buffer (50mM, pH 7.0), 10μl of 19mM hydrogen peroxide and 50μl enzyme source. The decrease in absorbance was measured immediately at 240nm against blank containing all the components except the enzyme at 10s intervals for 3min. The activity of enzyme was expressed in μmol of hydrogen peroxide consumed/mg protein/min."
7,Testicular steroidogenic enzymes,"2.6 Testicular steroidogenic enzymes The activities of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) (EC 1.1.1.145) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) (EC 1.1.1.51) were determined in the testicular microsomal fraction by the method of Bergmeyer [29]. The enzyme assays were made under conditions following zero-order kinetics after preliminary standardization regarding linearity with respect to time of incubation and enzyme concentration. The reaction mixture in a volume of 2.0mL contained 100μmol of sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 9.0) and 0.5μmol cofactor NAD for 3β-HSD and NADPH for 17β-HSD, 0.08μmol of substrate (dehydroepiandrosterone for 3β-HSD and androstenedione for 17β-HSD) and 100μl of enzyme source. The reactions were carried out in a quartz cuvette of 1.0cm path length at 23±1°C. The absorbance at 340nm was measured at 20s intervals for 3min in a Shimadzu UV–visible spectrophotometer. The enzyme activities were expressed as nmol of NAD converted to NADH/mg protein/min (3β-HSD) or nmol of NADPH converted to NADP/mg protein/min (17β-HSD). Protein content in the enzyme source was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. [30] using bovine serum albumin as standard."
8,Radioimmunoassay of serum hormones,"2.7 Radioimmunoassay of serum hormones Radioimmunoassay (RIA) for serum testosterone level determination was performed by the method described earlier [31] and previously validated in our laboratory [32]. The sensitivity of testosterone assay was 0.002ng and intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 6.5%. Serum FSH and LH were assayed according to the method of Lin et al. [33]. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.08ng for FSH and 0.06ng for LH. The intra-assay variations were 7.0% and 8.0% for FSH and LH, respectively. The inter-assay CV for testosterone, LH, and FSH were not available because all of the samples were analyzed at the same time."
9,Statistical analyses,"2.8 Statistical analyses All data were expressed as mean±S.D. of ten determinants. Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS version 7.5 (SPSS, Cary, NC, USA) and individual comparisons were made by Duncan's multiple range test."
10,Results,"The rats were observed for responses with respect to overall appearance, body position, activity, coordination or gait, and behavior. No significant changes in lacrimation, urination, respiration, postural, or gait abnormalities were observed in control and experimental rats. All the animals were apparently normal and no unusual behaviors (head searching, head flicking, licking, biting, circling, self-mutilation and balking backwards etc.) were observed in any of the experimental rats. None of the animals in the control, diabetic, alcohol, or diabetic+alcohol groups died during experimental period. The body weight and weights of seminal vesicles, ventral prostate and vas deferens did not show any significant change in the diabetic rats and rats treated with alcohol as compared to the control animals. The weights of the testis and epididymis were decreased significantly in diabetic and alcohol treated rats. Administration of alcohol to diabetic rats further decreased weights of the testis and cauda epididymis when compared to the diabetic rats (Table 1 ). In diabetic rats, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were significantly (p <0.01) higher than in control rats. The FBG levels in alcohol treated rats were also significantly elevated when compared to the control rats. FBG levels in diabetic rats treated with alcohol were further elevated significantly (p <0.01) as compared to diabetic rats (Fig. 1 ). Daily sperm production and epididymal sperm reserves, motile, viable and HOS-tail coiled sperms were significantly lower in diabetic rats than that in normal, nondiabetic rats. Administration of alcohol also resulted in significant decline in sperm production, reserves and quality. Treatment of diabetic rats with alcohol resulted in further reduction in daily sperm production, sperm count, motile, viable and HOS-tail coiled sperm as compared to diabetic rats (Table 2 ). MDA levels were significantly (p <0.01) higher in the testis and epididymis of diabetic rats as compared to control rats (Fig. 2 ). Treatment with alcohol also elevated MDA levels significantly (p <0.05) in the testis and epididymis as compared to control rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with alcohol resulted in a significantly higher MDA levels in the testis and epididymis as compared to diabetic rats (Fig. 2). SOD and catalase activity levels were decreased in the testis and epididymis of diabetic rats as compared to control rats (Figs. 3 and 4 ). Treatment with alcohol also resulted in significant decrease in SOD and catalase activity levels in testis and epididymis. Treatment of diabetic rats with alcohol resulted in further decrease in SOD and catalase activity levels in the testis and epididymis when compared with diabetic rats (Figs. 3 and 4). The circulatory levels of testosterone were significantly (p <0.05) decreased in alcohol treated and diabetic rats. The activity levels of 3β-HSD and 17β-HSDs were also decreased in the testis of these rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with alcohol resulted in a significantly lower testosterone levels as compared to diabetic rats. However, the serum FSH and LH levels were increased in diabetic rats and after alcohol treatment. The serum FSH and LH levels further elevated in diabetic rats treated with alcohol as compared to diabetic rats (Table 3 )."
11,Discussion,"This study produced significant observations with clinically important implications. Specifically, diabetes and alcohol induces oxidative stress in the testis and epididymis and caused sexual dysfunction in adult rats. This study further demonstrated that these changes are exacerbated in diabetic rats treated with alcohol. Alcohol was administered for 55 days in order to evaluate its effects through a complete spermatogenic cycle which takes approximately 55 days in Wistar rats [34] and the length of spermatogenic cycle is considered as biological constant controlled by germ cells. In the present study, rats were given 2.0g alcohol/kg bw/day, corresponding to the consumption of 2L of wine (10% alcohol) or 0.35L (half bottle) of whiskey (40% alcohol) by a man of 70kg body weight. In the present study, subjecting rats to either STZ or alcohol did not affect body weight gains compared to controls, indicating that the general condition of these animals was normal. On the contrary, the body weight of rats exposed simultaneously to alcohol and diabetes was significantly reduced. The weights of testes and epididymis reduced significantly in all the experimental rats compared to control rats. Similar results were reported earlier for adult rats exposed to STZ [35] or alcohol [19,36,37]. Testis weight is largely depending on the mass of the differentiated spermatogenic cells and epididymis weight depends on the density of mature sperm. The weights of testes and epididymis require continuous androgenic stimulation for their normal growth and function [38]. The observed reduction in the weight of the testes could be due to the reduction in the number of Leydig cells and germ cells as well as impaired leydig cell LH responsiveness in experimental rats. The reduction in epididymis weight may be due to reduced sperm density. The observed reduction in the weights of testes and epididymis also reflects reduced bioavailability and/or production of androgen in the diabetic rats. Similarly, rats treated with 4.05g alcohol/kg/day for 8 weeks had reduced germ cell numbers with a reduction in seminiferous tubular diameter [37,39]. Both in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that chronic ethanol treatment (7 weeks exposure) has direct adverse effects on Leydig cell morphology and function [39]. The weights of accessory sex organs (vas deferens, seminal vesicles and ventral prostate) depend on bioavailability and/or production of androgen in animals. Though circulatory levels of testosterone decreased significantly in alcohol treated rats, the weights of accessory sex organs did not show any significant change as compared with the control animals, indicating testes and epididymis are more sensitive to alcohol toxicity when compared to accessory sex organs. Decreased sperm production and semen volume was reported earlier in diabetic animals and humans [40]. In the present study, the daily sperm production and epididymal sperm density, motility, and viability decreased significantly in rats subjected to STZ or alcohol which are in agreement with earlier reports [41–44]. A precipitous decline in motility and a significant decline in number of HOS tail coiled sperm indicated that hyperglycemia severely affected not only the ability to reach the site of fertilization as well as their ability to penetrate zona pellucida. The mechanism of diabetes or alcohol associated reduction in sperm production is not clear but it is tempting to speculate that they resulted from a lower concentration of testosterone. In the present study, circulatory testosterone levels reduced significantly with a decrease in the activity levels of testicular steroidogenic enzymes. The results are consistent with earlier reports of decreased 3β- and 17β-HSD and serum testosterone levels in diabetic [44,45] alcohol treated rats [46]. Lower testosterone levels are believed to accelerate sperm transport [47] and thus can explain the reduced number of sperm in the epididymis. However, data from earlier studies do not support lower testosterone levels as the only or even a major factor in inducing the epididymal and sperm anarchy [48]. The elevated levels of serum FSH and LH with lowered testosterone levels in the diabetic and alcohol treated rats are indicative of an intact pituitary-testicular axis. The increase in serum FSH levels also indicates impairment of spermatogenesis in the experimental rats and reflects germ cell loss or damage to the Sertoli cells, there by affecting the feedback regulation of FSH secretion [49]. The decrease in testosterone titers could be due to the diminished responsiveness of Leydig cells to LH and/or the direct inhibition of testicular steroidogenesis. The decrease in epididymal sperm count in diabetic and alcohol treated rats can also result from generation of more reactive oxygen species. The mechanism of reduction in sperm production in diabetic and alcohol treated rats has also been shown to be mediated by generation of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) besides compromised androgen production. In both conditions, significant hyperglycaemia was noticed. Many studies have shown that hyperglycaemia was able to increase tissue oxidative stress via activating the polyol pathway, nonenzymatic protein glycosylation, and autooxidation of glucose leading to increased production of ROS which include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical [50,51]. Experimentally induced diabetic rats were known to have high levels of tissue oxidative stress as characterized by high amount of MDA [52] and can cause damage to the proteins, lipids, and DNA [53]. Additionally, hyperglycemia could also reduce antioxidant defense systems of the body [54]. In the present study, MDA levels in diabetic rat testes and epididymis were higher than non-diabetic rats whereas the activity levels of SOD and catalase decreased. Elevated levels of ROS during STZ-induced diabetes have been reported by several authors [55,56]. Several studies also reveal that free radical generation and lipid peroxidation might be an important mechanism in the toxicity of ethanol in the testes [37,57,58]. At present, we do not know whether alcohol-induced reduction in steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis is indirect (mediated by radical generation) or direct or both. Spermatozoa have been considered to be highly susceptible to the damage induced by ROS because of their high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In spermatozoa several antioxidant defense systems namely, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase are known to operate. SOD generally dismutases the superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide, which is further degraded by catalase. The reduction in the activities of SOD and catalase reflects the inability of diabetic rat tissues to eliminate superoxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals generated during hyperglycemia leading to accumulation of ROS. ROS appears to be the key agents causing cyto-toxic effects in spermatozoa [59] resulting in decline of sperm counts in men and experimental animals [16]. Finally, the effects observed for several end points were more pronounced in diabetic rats exposed to alcohol than with diabetes and alcohol alone. Administration of alcohol has been found to potentiate diabetes-induced sexual dysfunction including decline in spermatogenesis. In rats subjected to both alcohol and diabetes, the decrease observed in the serum level of testosterone as compared to alcohol alone treated rats might also be having a potentiating effect of alcohol in affecting the steroidogenesis in the testes of diabetic rats. A potent and synergistic interaction has also been observed between alcohol and diabetes in inducing oxidative toxicity. These findings indicate the possible effect of alcohol, characterized by decreased steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis and elevated oxidative toxicity, in potentiating the diabetes-induced sexual dysfunction. While serving our purpose of providing reference end points, the stresses selected in the present study clearly do not represent all environmental stresses experienced by humans and wildlife. The nature of interactions between such stresses may be more complex. What we believe to be the case, however, is that alcohol consumption/diabetes does possess the ability to affect endocrine signals, thereby suppressing reproduction. Our findings also reveal the possible role of alcohol in exacerbating the testicular and epididymal toxicity in diabetic rats. Obviously, our comments are purely speculative because of the descriptive nature of the study, which warrants further work to determine the underlying molecular bases of these results. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that exposure to alcohol results in reproductive dysfunction in male rats and the effect is exacerbated in diabetic rats. However, at the present time, the exact contribution of oxidative toxicity versus compromised steroidogenesis resulting in jeopardized reproduction cannot be discerned. Regardless, our study demonstrates that diabetic individuals consuming alcohol have to be cognizant of their unfavorable reproductive risk profile."
