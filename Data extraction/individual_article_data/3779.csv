0,Introduction,"Skin serves as an essential natural barrier organ, protecting internal organs from the external environment and avoiding dehydration. The wound is caused by skin rupture or defects depending on clinical and physiological conditions, as well as physical, thermal, and chemical traumas [1]. The Wound healing process is a sophisticated pathophysiological and convoluted process combining hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling phases [2]. Chronic inflammation, impaired growth factor production, persistent microbial infections, and impaired angiogenesis are the primary causes of prolonged wound healing [3,4]. Another factor contributing to the delay in healing is reducing in the proliferation, migration, and translocation of original cells such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes, which are required to form functioning skin. Other variables, such as the increased release of tissue degrading enzymes, chronic bacterial infections lead to life-threatening complications. Lack of vascularization, also plays an important role [5,6]. As a result, wound dressings were indeed developed. An ideal wound dressing should have adequate mechanical property, moisture retention, exudate absorption capacity, high biocompatibility, hemostasis, outstanding antibacterial activity, mimic extracellular matrix (ECM), cost-efficient, and reduced inflammation. These properties are inadequate in traditional and commercial wound dressing material [7–9]. In the last quarter-century, significant advances in wound dressings have been made. Hydrogels, forms, hydrocolloids, nanofiber integration with nanomaterials, growth factors, and biomolecules, have been intensively explored to expedite the wound healing process. However, they have limited mechanical stability, expensive, and only focus on particular phase (such as killing pathogens, stimulating cell migration and proliferation, or absorbing wound exudates) of the wound healing process [10]. Therefore, an ideal dressing material must consider all the drawbacks mentioned above. By satisfying the requirements for an ideal wound dressing material, polymeric film dressing was developed to promote multiple wound healing stages. Chitosan (CS), a chitin derivative, possesses advantageous biological qualities such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, nontoxicity, outstanding swelling, muco-adhesion, homeostasis, anticancer, stimuli-responsive activity, coagulation, and wound healing [11]. Furthermore, chitosan promotes homeostasis and occlusion via absorption of proteins and adherence of blood platelets. Even though CS is advantageous in wound dressing application, CS-based patches, on the other hand, have poor mechanical characteristics, stability, and chemical resistance. To overcome possible obstacles, CS is blended with other polymers or materials to improve mechanical properties and stability [12]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a hydrophilic polymer, possesses high biocompatibility, non-carcinogenic, swelling capacity, flexibility, and non-toxic property. Thus, CS is blended with PVA to increase the mechanical property of the patch [13,14]. Potential succedaneum must be adopted to avoid wound infection by bacteria and encourage different wound healing process stages. TiO2, a well-known metal oxide semiconductor with a large band gap (3.2 eV), high chemical stability, low toxicity, relatively low cost, and is employed for excellent photocatalytic and antibacterial activities [15]. The antibacterial activity of TiO2 is limited by its wider bandgap (UV-active) and greater recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. To overcome this limitation doping with transition metal Vanadium (V) was performed to broaden the spectrum to the visible region and reduce the band gap. Further, graphene oxide (GO) was made into a composite with V doped TiO2 (TiO2-V) to dissociate photo-induced electrons (e−) and holes (h+), resulting in more efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and efficient visible light-triggered antibacterial activity. Under visible light radiation, the e− from the valence band (VB) moves to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2-V further transferred to GO, creating an h+ in VB of TiO2-V. As the recombination of the electron-hole pair is prolonged, the e− and h+ react with oxygen and water molecules resulting in ROS generation like OH−, O2 − [16,17]. Moreover, TiO2-V shows high Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and stimulates cell growth, proliferation, and migration, essential for wound healing [18]. Moreover, GO also demonstrated antibacterial activity through high oxidative stress, cell wrapping, and membrane stress caused by its structure. The incorporation of GO can be used as an efficient filler to enhance the mechanical properties of polymeric patches [8]. In addition to it, GO allows non-covalent binding of proteins/Keratinocyte inducers on its surface via hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions (chemical and mechanical signaling for integrin clustering and focal contact formation), or π − π interactions and high wrinkled surface that promotes cell adhesion and proliferation. Thus, integrating GO with TiO2-V to develop a nanocomposite (GO/TiO2-V) and blend with polymer (CS/PVA) can dramatically speed up wound healing by promoting inflammation, proliferation, and adhesion at various phases. In the current study, a visible-light-driven CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch was prepared and evaluated for its antibacterial and wound healing potential. Complete structural, chemical, and morphology of the nanocomposite (NCs) were characterized followed by analyzing the mechanical, swelling, degradation, moisture vapor transmission rate, oxygen permeability property, hemocompatibility and biocompatibility, antibacterial activity, the in-vitro and in-vivo wound healing property of the CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch (NC patch)."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of Vanadium doped TiO2 (TiO2 -V),"2.1 Synthesis of Vanadium doped TiO2 (TiO2 -V) Sol-gel precipitation was used to synthesize V doped TiO2 [19]. A stoichiometric amount of NH4VO3 was dissolved in 500 ml of deionized water and agitated continuously for 1 h. Meanwhile, a stoichiometric amount of Ti (C4H9O)4 was dissolved in C3H8O with a ratio of 1:9 in a different beaker and added dropwise into the initially prepared aqueous solution containing vanadium ions. The pH of the reaction was maintained at 2 by adding 1 M HNO3 and stirring for 24 h, following which the sample was obtained by drying at 50 °C and calcining in a muffle furnace at 400 °C. Different percentage of V doped TiO2 (1%, 2%, and 3%) were synthesis by maintaining the vanadium concentration as 1, 2, and 3 atom % with respect to Ti. They are mentioned as TiO2-V1, TiO2-V2 and TiO2-V3. Pure TiO2 was synthesized using the same method as described above, except for ammonium vanadate."
3,Synthesis of GO/TiO2-V,"2.2 Synthesis of GO/TiO2-V GO was synthesized by Hummers' method as reported in our previous work [20]. A stoichiometric amount of GO was suspended in a solution containing a 1:2 ratio of ethanol and water, followed by ultrasonication for 1 h. Based on cytotoxicity analysis (in-vitro), TiO2-V2 was chosen as the optimum doping concentration for nanocomposite preparation and denoted as GO/TiO2-V. The obtained V-doped TiO2 was added to the GO solution and stirred for 2 h. The resulting solution is transferred to 60 ml autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 100 °C for 3 h. The resulting solution was washed several times and dried at ambient temperature to obtain the nanocomposite powder GO/TiO2-V [14]."
4,Synthesis of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V,"2.3 Synthesis of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V The gel casting method was used to fabricate CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch [21]. Chitosan solution [2% (w/w)] was prepared by dissolving it in an aqueous solution of acetic acid [2% (v/v)] at 60 °C under constant stirring for 4 h. Similarly, 2% PVA solution was prepared in deionized water and constantly stirred for 3 h under 80 °C. Once the polymers were entirely dissolved, the solutions were blended and vigorously mixed for 30 min. The resultant clear solution was cast in a glass petri dish and allowed to dry at ambient temperature to obtain the CS/PVA film. For nanocomposite incorporated patch, the optimal concentration of GO/TiO2-V was resuspended in 5 ml deionized water and added to the polymeric blend and stirred for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension, followed by casting and drying it in a petri dish to obtain CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch."
5,Determination of antibacterial activity,"2.4 Determination of antibacterial activity The antibacterial activity of the synthesized nanomaterial was analyzed through minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) determine by a micro dilution method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates [22], and using Mueller Hinton agar plate with a final inoculum concentration of 106 CFU/ml. A stock of 0.25–10 mg/ml of the nanomaterials (TiO2, TiO2-V1, TiO2-V2, TiO2-V3, and GO/TiO2-V) were sterilized and tested against bacterium (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis). Serial dilution of the sample stock solution (initially 100 μl from the stock was added in the first row and scaler dilution was further carried out) was added in the 96-well plate with 10 μl reassuring indicator solution and 30 μl nutrient broth. Finally, 10 μl of bacterial test suspension was added to each well to attain 106 CFU/ml and were placed in incubation for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of visible light (PoL) and absence of light (AoL), (10 W, 465–480 nm, LED, distance of 10 cm from the plate). Colour change (purple to pink/colourless) was recorded as positive, and the lowest concentration at which colour change occurred was taken as the MIC value. The study was triplicated, and mean values were obtained for MIC. Later 100 μl of medium from the 96-well, which shows no visible growth in MIC assay (±2 well), was aspirated and spread evenly on a nutrient agar plate. The plates were placed in incubation for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence and absence of visible light (as same parameters given above), and the resulted colony was used to obtain the MBC value. Plates with no colony formation were considered as MBC. To test the antibacterial activity of the fabricated patches (CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V), a patch size of 1 × 1 cm was cut and placed in Mueller Hinton agar plate containing 106 CFU/ml spread out evenly and placed in incubation for 24 h at 37 °C in presence and absence of visible light. After 24 h, the zone of incubation was recorded. The test was triplicated."
6,Time-dependent growth inhibition study,"2.5 Time-dependent growth inhibition study To examine the bacterial growth curve, test bacterium with inoculum concentration of 106 CFU/ml were taken in the test tube and treated with and without MIC concentration of synthesized nanomaterial [23]. Test tube without nanomaterial treatment is considered as control. All the test tubes were incubated in an orbital shaking incubator at 37 °C for 24 h in AoL and PoL with the same parameter as mentioned above. The bacterial growth was determined by measuring optical density at 600 nm every 4 h during the incubation period. The experiment was carried out in triplicate, and the average result was obtained."
7,Biofilm inhibition assay,"2.6 Biofilm inhibition assay Biofilm inhibition after treatment with nanocomposites in AoL and PoL was quantified by using tissue culture plate crystal violet assays in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates [24]. Test bacterium (106 CFU/ml) treated with MIC concentration of nanomaterials were incubated for 24 h at 37° C. Untreated bacterium were taken as control. Following the incubation period, the well components were discarded and rinsed three times with 1 × PBS. After drying the wells for 10–15 min, the biofilms in the microtiter plates were stained for 10 min with 0.1% crystal violet solution. The surplus dyes were removed after staining, and the biofilm in the wells was rinsed with PBS. After thoroughly drying the wells, the biofilm in the wells was assessed by dissolving the dye in 95% ethanol and measuring the absorbance at OD595. The experiment was carried out in triplicate, and the average result was obtained."
8,ROS generation,"2.7 ROS generation To analyze the oxidative stress, induce in test bacterium, ROS generation was quantified using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (DCFDA) [14]. The cells were seeded in 96 well plates with a black bottom, then incubated for 24 h with cells exposed to MIC concentration of nanomaterial in AoL and PoL. Then the good components were rinsed using PBS and incubated with CM-H2DCFDA dye for 30 min, after which 200 ml of PBS was added to replace the reaction mixture. Fluorescence was measured using a multi-well plate reader at 485 and 525 nm. The experiment was carried out in triplicate, and the average result was obtained."
9,Bacteria TEM analysis,"2.8 Bacteria TEM analysis The synthesized nanomaterial was incubated with the test bacterium as mentioned in the Time-dependent growth inhibition study with the same parameters. After 24 h of incubation, the samples were washed, and the pellet was obtained. The obtained pellet was rinsed with 0.1 M PBS before being fixed with 0.5 ml of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and dehydrated with 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% ethanol. Finally, the pellet was dispersed in 1 ml of 100% ethanol and coated on a TEM grid by drop-cast technique."
10,Swelling analysis,"2.9 Swelling analysis Gravimetric measurement at room temperature was used to determine the swelling characteristics of CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch [25]. The patches were completely dried in a vacuum oven before being weighed as Wi. Individual samples were submerged in a beaker containing 50 ml of water. The change in weight of the film was measured at regular time intervals Ws after the excess surface water was wiped away using a filter paper. The proportion of weight gain is calculated as the quantity of water swelling % (WS %) using the following equation: WS % = W s − W i / W i × 100 The study continues until no additional changes in Ws are noticed. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the average result was obtained."
11,Degradation analysis,"2.10 Degradation analysis An in-vitro degradation investigation of CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patches was done [13]. The patches were thoroughly dried in a vacuum oven before being cut into a 2 × 2 cm square and weighed as (Wi). For 14 days, the weighed sample was immersed in 20 ml of PBS containing 10 mg of lysozyme at 37 °C. The samples were withdrawn from the PBS solution at each time point (24 h), washed, and weighed (Wd) after vacuum drying. The weight losses were computed using the equation below. Degradation % = W i − W d / W i × 100 SEM was also used to characterize the changes in the morphology of the nanofibrous mats."
12,Measurement of moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR),"2.11 Measurement of moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR) The moisture permeability of the CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patches was determined using the ASTM standard [26]. The samples were cut into 35 mm diameter circles and placed in a cylindrical moisture-permeable cup containing 10 ml of DI water. These parts were sealed with Teflon tape and tested at 37 degrees Celsius and 90% relative humidity. Every hour, the cup was weighed and recorded until the readings were steady. The experiment was repeated three times, and the average result was obtained."
13,O2 permeability measurements,"2.12 O2 permeability measurements Approximating the dissolved oxygen in the water was used to calculate the oxygen permeability [27]. The patches were placed on top of a flask filled with 200 ml of deionized water. For 24 h, the flasks were kept at room temperature. Using Winkler's Method dissolved oxygen in the water was tested. The open container served as the positive control, while the closed container served as the negative control. The O2 permeability measurements were given in milligram per liter (mg/l)."
14,Porosity measurement,"2.13 Porosity measurement The liquid displacement technique was used to determine the porosity of the scaffolds, with ethanol serving as the displacement liquid [28]. A known dry weight (W) of patches was determined and immersed in a known volume of ethanol (V1). V2 denotes the total volume of ethanol after the patch has been immersed. After that, the ethanol-impregnated patches were withdrawn from the cylinder, and the remaining ethanol volume was measured (V3). The studies were repeated five times to acquire the average porosity value. The following equation was used to calculate the Patch porosity % (PP %) PP % = V 1 − V 3 / V 2 − V 3 × 100"
15,Mechanical property,"2.14 Mechanical property The tabletop tensile tester measured the mechanical properties of the fabricated CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch in accordance with standard methods (ASTM D638-2010). The samples were cut into strips of 70 mm length and 25 mm width with a 5 m precision. The relative humidity and crosshead speed were both 50% and 50 mm/min. All specimens were pulled at ambient temperature and ultimate tensile strength, evaluated in triplicate using elongation and recorded simultaneously. Before testing, the films were soaked in water at room temperature to determine their mechanical characteristics in the wet condition. For each sample, at least 5 specimens were examined."
16,Cytotoxicity analysis,"2.15 Cytotoxicity analysis Cytotoxicity of the synthesized samples was determined using MTT assay against NIH3t3 fibroblast [29]. NIH3t3 fibroblast cells were cultured in complete media that contains high DMEM supplemented with l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μl/ml streptomycin's, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B and incubated at 37° C with 5% CO2 at humidified atmosphere. The culture medium was changed every two days until cells reached confluence. Once, confluency is attained, cells were detached using 0.25% trypsin and seed in 96 well plates with a cell density of 6 × 103 cells per well and incubated till 80% confluency was attained. After which the conditional media is added, that contain TiO2, TiO2-V1, TiO2-V2, TiO2-V3 and GO/TiO2-V at different concentrations (5, 10, 15,20,25,30 and 50 μg/ml), and incubated for 48 h in PoL and AoL. For CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V, leach liquor, used for cytotoxicity assay, was obtained by immersing the patch in DMEM culture media overnight. Cells without nanomaterial treatment are used as control. After 48 h of incubation, the media was removed and washed with 1 × PBS, and 200 μl of 0.05% MTT solution (in DMEM) was added to the wells and incubated for 3 h. Then the media was removed, and 200 μl of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the formed formazan crystals. The absorbance of the resulting solution was determined at 570 nm to determine cell viability. Cell viability % = sample OD − Blank / control OD − Blank × 100"
17,Blood compatibility analysis,"2.16 Blood compatibility analysis The hemolysis test is being used to examine the compatibility of biomaterials with blood in an in-vitro model. The experiments were performed and evaluated by ASTM F 756-00 and ISO 10993 standards [30]. A healthy volunteer's human blood (HB) was drawn under citrate conditions no more than 30 min before the exposure began. As a standard solution, 4 ml of blood was mixed with 5 ml of 0.9% saline. Synthesized samples of 10 μg/ml and a patch of 1 × 1 cm were cut and equilibrated for 30 min at 37 °C in 4 ml of saline. 200 μl of the standard solution was added to a saline solution containing the sample and incubated for a different time point (60, 120, and 180 min) at 37 °C in AoL and PoL. For positive and negative control, 200 μl of HB was added to 4 ml of distilled water and saline, respectively. After incubating for different time points, the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm, followed by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 545 nm. Percentage of Hemolysis was calculated using the below formula. Hemolysis % = OD Sample − OD Negative / OD Positive − OD Negative × 100 Since the ultimate output is the CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch that will be utilized for wound healing, the patch was taken and visualized through FESEM as a different conformation at each endpoint of incubation."
18,Scratch assay,"2.17 Scratch assay The scratch assay was used to investigate the cell proliferation and migratory abilities on the fabricated patch [31]. CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patches were sterilized and immersed in liquid nitrogen and powdered using sterile mortal-pestle. Conditional media was prepared by adding the powder to high DMEM with 1% Pen-Strep and stirred in an incubator for 24 h at 37 °C followed by sterile filtering (0.22 mm) using a syringe filter. For control regular high glucose media with supplements were used. NIH3t3 cell was seeded in 24 well plates with a cell density of 5 × 104 per well in the presence of high DMEM supplemented with l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μl/ml streptomycins, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B and incubated at 37° C with 5% CO2 at humidified atmosphere. Once confluency was reached, a vertical scratch was established in each well with a 200 μl sterile pipette tip, followed by a PBS wash to remove debris and unattached cells. The PBS was then removed, and conditional and control media were added to the wells, then incubated in AoL and PoL in a CO2 incubator. Migration of cells was observed at 12 and 24 h using an optical microscope. Wound area was measured using Image J software from the attained optical images."
19,Morphology analysis,"2.18 Morphology analysis CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch was sterilized and placed in 6 well plates along with the 2 ml of complete media (high DMEM supplemented with l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μl/ml streptomycins, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B) and cell density of 3 × 105 cells each well and incubated at 37C with humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 and 72 h. Images were captured using the inverted fluorescent microscope to check the cell adhesion and morphology [32]. In addition, cell viability is analyzed through live/dead assay, following the kit protocol. After incubating the patch with the cell for the specified time period, the patch was treated for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator with a solution containing 4 mM ethidium homodimer and 2 mM calcein-aceto-methoxy. Then the patch was washed several times with PBS and observed under an inverted fluorescent microscope [31]."
20,In-vivo wound healing study,"2.19 In-vivo wound healing study The previous study concluded that CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V demonstrated excellent mechanical, antibacterial activity, in-vitro wound healing behaviour with high cell proliferation and adhesion. However, real-time application (wound dressing patches) entail in-vivo research since in-vitro studies lack the intrinsic complexity of entire organ systems, paving the way for in-vivo analysis to understand CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V on the body as a whole. In vivo animal study on Wistar rats was approved by Institutional Animal Ethical Committee, SRM Institute of Science and Technology. 18 Wistar rats (male and female) weighing 240–270 g, aged between 8 and 10 weeks, were separated into three equal groups (Group I – untreated (control), Group II - CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch, Group III – commercial patch (Tegaderm)) and kept at SRM Animal House for a week prior to the experiment in separate sterile polypropylene cages with sterile paddy husk bedding, regular rodent feed, and water for acclimatization. The animals were kept in a 12-hour dark-light cycle with 50% humidity and a temperature of 20 ± 2 °C. Full-thickness excisional wounds on either side of the dorsal midline were created in an animal. Briefly, the dorsal surfaces of the rats were shaved one day before the experiment. On the day of the experiment (wound creation), the rats were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection using ketamine; after disinfecting with 70% alcohol on the region of interest, a wound size of 15 × 15 mm was created by removing the dermal and epidermal layers by surgical incision method using a surgical scalpel and forceps [33]. CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch was sterilized before applying to the wound region. The patch was then attached to the wound with surgical adhesive tape, leaving the patch exposed to visible light and followed by housing the rats in the same condition as mentioned above. CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V and Tegaderm dressing was changed every 3 days before cleaning the wound region with sterile saline, and for the untreated group, the surgical drapes were employed. The wounds were photographed at a regular time point (n = 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 days) and measured using the following equation: Wound closure % = W i − W t / W i × 100 Wi and Wt represent the initial wound area and wound area at a regular time point (n = 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 days). No complications were observed during this experimental period. On the final day of the experiment, the tissue grown on the wound region and organs like the liver, spleen, and kidneys, from each group are excised and fixed with 10% formalin. These samples were paraffin-embedded and serial sections with a thickness of around 5 μm were cut, mounted on glass slides, and stained with Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin-eosin reagents for histological analysis. Stained tissues are imaged through a phase-contrast microscope and were analyzed. The hydroxyproline content in the wound area was determined on day 12 using Biovision's hydroxyproline assay kit and its method."
21,Statistical analysis,2.20 Statistical analysis The Origin 8.0 software was used to analyze the data. One-way analysis of variance was used to examine statistical differences between the data. The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for final results.
22,Results and discussion,"X-ray diffraction technique has been employed to analyze the crystalline nature and phase composition of the prepared samples. Fig. 1(a) shows the diffractogram of pure TiO2, V doped TiO2, and GO/TiO2 nanocomposite. The characteristics diffraction peak of TiO2 around 2θ = 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.1°, 53.9°, 55.1°, 62.9°, 68.8°, 70.3°, 75.05° and 82.2° corresponds to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), (215) and (224) crystal planes respectively. All diffraction peaks are well defined and can be perfectly assigned to the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS-21–1272) [34]. The spectra for vanadium doped TiO2 show only the presence of anatase TiO2 and no other characteristic peaks associated with other crystalline forms of TiO2. Vanadium was detected in the XRD pattern. This indicates that the vanadium ions were successfully incorporated into the crystal lattice of anatase TiO2 or vanadium oxides were dispersed well on the surface of the TiO2 particles. The shift in the (101) crystal plane of vanadium doped TiO2 indicates the successful substitution of vanadium ions into the TiO2 lattice as the ionic radius of V4+ (0.072 nm), or V5+ (0.068 nm) is moreover similar to Ti4+ (0.074 nm) than V3+ (0.078 nm). So that it can attain electron neutrality in the lattice [35]. The (101) crystal plane in vanadium doped TiO2 shifts toward the lower angle due to the lattice expansion, which further confirms the replacement of Ti4+ ion with Vanadium ions (due to the larger size ion substitution of the TiO2 lattice). As the doping % increases, the diffraction peak intensity at 2θ = 25.3° slightly decreases, indicating a loss of crystallinity due to lattice distortion in V doped TiO2 when compared to undoped TiO2. The average crystallite size of TiO2, TiO2-V1, TiO2-V2, and TiO2-V3 were calculated by the Debye-Scherrer formula and found to be 21, 18.4, 17.6, and 16.8 nm, respectively. The decrease in the crystallite size of V doped TiO2 might be due to the substitution of smaller ionic radius vanadium ions that causes lattice contraction due to lattice disruption [36]. Thus, the lattice contraction reveals that V4+ or V5+ ions, which have a similar ionic radius of Ti4+, might be substituted in the TiO2 lattice, which is future confirmed by XPS analysis. Moreover, Doping vanadium into TiO2 hinders phase transformation (anatase to rutile) by preventing the breakage of (TiO) bond in anatase structure and also compensating the decrease in oxygen vacancies by vanadium ions [37]. Pure GO exhibits characteristics peak around 11.8°, but due to the presence of nanocomposite (TiO2-V) the crystalline nature of GO reduces, and a peak shift was observed. The presence of a GO diffraction peak at 2θ 10.22° corresponds to the (001) crystal plane of GO in the synthesized nanocomposite. The interplanar spacing was found to be 0.86 nm [38,39]. This larger d-spacing implies the successful oxidation of graphite flaxes into GO by introducing the oxygenated functional group into the sheet structure. The presence of TiO2-V characteristics peaks and the GO diffraction peak confirms the successful preparation of GO/TiO2-V nanocomposite which is further visualized by TEM analysis. The reduction in the peak intensity and peak broadening of vanadium doped TiO2 in GO composite reveals the slight reduction in crystalline nature of TiO2-V due to the introduction of defects (lattice disruption) by functional groups in GO. FTIR analyses were carried out to study the chemical structure and the corresponding functional groups of the prepared samples. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the FTIR spectra of TiO2, TiO2 −V1, TiO2 −V2, TiO2 −V3, and GO/TiO2 −V. TiO2 shows a characteristics absorption peak between 690 and 400 cm−1 that attributes to the pure anatase phase of TiO2. The peaks at 463.88 cm−1, 728.44 cm−1, and 1632 cm−1 ascribe to the TiO bond vibration, Ti-O-Ti bonds stretching (bridging stretching), Ti-OH asymmetric and symmetric stretching, and bending vibrations respectively. The broadband observed around 3000–3600 cm−1 corresponds to the OH stretching mode of the hydroxyl group, and bands around 1120 cm−1 and 1060 cm−1 correspond to the -OH bending mode [40]. For the different % of vanadium doped TiO2, a similar spectrum of anatase TiO2 with a slight shift in the band and some new characteristic peaks were observed. The absorption band around 967 cm−1 reflects the VO vibration, and V-O-V symmetric and asymmetric stretching at 526 cm−1 and 730 cm−1. The shift in the peak position at 1120 cm−1 and 1060 cm−1 in V doped TiO2 infers the interaction of vanadium ions with the OH group of TiO2. The intensity of the OH group around 3000–3600 cm−1 increases with an increase in doping concentration which can improve the photocatalytic activity. Similarly, the peak at 1089 cm−1 represents the absorption band of V in the TiO2-OH complex. The presence of V bond stretching and vibration with TiO2 confirms the substitution of vanadium ions in TiO2 lattice [41]. In GO/TiO2 −V the major characteristic peak of GO is noted. The absorption peak of the hydroxyl group is at 3420 cm−1, CH bond vibration is at 2924 cm−1, the CO vibration mode is at 2353 cm−1and the skeletal vibration band of CC is at 1628 cm−1 . The carboxyl group at 1379 cm−1and (epoxide) C–O–C or (phenolic) C–O–H stretching vibrations around 1220 cm−1 shows less intensity due to the formation of Ti–O–C bond (460.22 cm−1) on the GO surface. A similar spectrum is observed for TiO2-V2 nanocomposite with a minor shift and absence of some peak due to the Ti–O–C signal. An oxygen functional group in GO plays a significant role in providing anchoring sites for V doped-TiO2 [42,17]. Thus, the obtained FTIR spectrum confirms the V doped TiO2 and is well absorbed on the sheets of GO (Ti–O–C bond formation) to form nanocomposites. Raman spectroscopy analysis was carried out further to study synthesized samples' structure, chemical, and vibration band. It provides significant statistics about the defects, disorder, crystallinity, and degree of hybridization for the prepared samples. Fig. 1c illustrates the Raman spectrum of TiO2, TiO2 −V1, TiO2 −V2, TiO2 −V3, and GO/TiO2 −V. TiO2 shows 6 Raman active vibration modes (3E g + 2B 1g + 1A 1g ) centred around 144 cm−1 (E g ), 199 cm−1 (E g ), 400 cm−1 (B 1g ), 518 cm−1 (A 1g /B 1g ) and 638 cm−1 (E g ) [43]. The E g , B 1g, and A 1g modes attribute to the O-Ti-O symmetric stretching vibration, symmetric bending vibration, and anti-symmetric bending vibration respectively [44]. Thus, the TiO2 peak position confirms the tetragonal anatase phase, which correlates with the XRD data. In the case of V-doped TiO2 and nanocomposites, a significant blue shift in the principle Eg (144 cm−1) mode was observed. A shift of 4–7 cm−1 and 13–15 cm−1was observed for vanadium doped TiO2 and GO/TiO2-V, respectively. This is due to the lattice contraction (can be explained by phonon confinement and force constraints) and the strength of the TiO bond by V ions [39]. This indicates a contraction in the anatase unit cell and well matches with the XRD results where no change was observed. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that Raman spectroscopy is more surface-sensitive compared to XRD. The presence of two characteristic peaks of graphene oxide around 1350 (D-band) and 1595 (G- band) indicates the effective preparation of the nanocomposites. The data about in-plane vibration of sp2-bonded carbon domains (sp2 hybridized carbon) is provided by the G band, whereas the D band specifies sp3 defects. I D/I G ratio of nanocomposite was found to be 0.895 nm. Lowering the I D/I G implies the least defect in GO [45]. When compared to pure GO (reported elsewhere)[14], the broadening of G- band implies the increase in an isolated double bond, and little disturbance in the D- band indicates the disorder in the GO structure, which can de due to oxygen defects in the lattice created by vanadium doped TiO2 nanocomposite. Fig. 1d shows the UV–vis spectra for the synthesized nanomaterials. TiO2 shows absorption spectrum in UV range with an energy band gap of 3.2 eV (charge transfer between the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) by 2p orbitals of anion oxide in VB and 3dt2g of Ti4+ cations in CB) that corresponds to the pure anatase phase [46]. Doping of vanadium in TiO2 shows a redshift in the absorption spectrum. As the doping increase, the absorption spectrum moves toward the visible light, further widening the light absorption range and reducing the bandgap of Vanadium doped TiO2. Bandgap for TiO2 and vanadium doped TiO2 was found from Schuster-Kubelka-Munk absorption function(αhν)1/2 vs. photon energy (hν) plot and shown in Fig. 1e. The bandgap of TiO2 decreased from 3.2 to 2.7, 2.52, and 2.31 eV as the doping of vanadium increased by 1%. The shift in the spectrum toward the visible region is due to the substitution of Ti4+ by vanadium, overlapping and 3d and 2p orbital of vanadium and oxygen, and charge transfer between valence bands to the t2g level of V [35,47]. Besides the vanadium doping, the decrease in the bandgap energy is due to the localized gap state (impurity energy level or new electronic state) formed between the CB and VB of TiO2. These gap states overlap between the maximum CB or maximum VB where electron of VB excites to the gap states (UV absorption) then to CB (visible light absorption) [16]. In the presence of GO, the absorption spectra further move toward the visible spectra when compare to the Vanadium doped TiO2 as it forms a C-O-Ti covalent bond through the unpaired π electron of GO and also due to the combined effect of oxygen valency and strain. Therefore, the effective bandgap becomes narrower in the composited, allowing transitions of electrons even by visible light and increasing photocatalytic activity [48]. Fig. 1f shows the photoluminescence of the V-doped samples of TiO2-V1, TiO2-V2, TiO2-V3, and GO/TiO2-V catalysts. The TiO2-V1 sample shows higher PL intensity than TiO2-V2 and TiO2-V3 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). PL intensity is decreased with increasing the dopant concentration due to the creation of oxygen vacancies. Especially, V doping aids in trapping the holes and also allows electron transfer between newly introduced defects states and the valance band. Further, the GO/TiO2-V shows lower PL intensity than TiO2-V1, TiO2-V2, and TiO2-V3. Generally, graphene is effectively involved in the transportation of charge carriers and reduces the charge carrier recombination effect. These investigations depicted that the V dopant is creating the oxygen vacancy in the TiO2 to induce the structural defects, while the graphene reduces the recombination effect resulting in the formation of the visible light active GO/TiO2-V catalyst for the wound healing application under visible light. The states of the elements and chemical compositions of the GO/TiO2-V nanocomposite were investigated by XPS analysis, as displayed in Fig. 2 (a–e). The survey spectra in Fig. 2a show that the GO/TiO2-V consists of Ti 5p, C1s, O1s, V 2p, and Ti 2p without any impurities. The deconvoluted C 1s spectrum in Fig. 2b exhibits the strongest peak of C==C at 284.7 eV and the low intense peak of CO at 285.7 eV, which can be attributed to the availability of oxygen factionalized groups on the surfaces of graphene. Fig. 2c shows the deconvoluted Ti 2p of GO/TiO2-V, exhibiting the typical duplet peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks at 464.72 and 459.43 eV, respectively. Also, the deconvoluted Ti (IV) and Ti (III) peaks were attributed at 458.4 eV and 457.2 eV, respectively, related to the rutile phase TiO2. Moreover, the Ti 2p3/2 is shifted to 0.2 eV compared to pure TiO2 due to the incorporation of V into the anatase lattice. The deconvoluted V 2p in Fig. 2d exhibits the duplet peaks of V 2p3/2, and V 2p1/2 cantered at 517.2 and 523.6 eV, respectively, which are associated with the V (V) and V (IV) of the vanadate. Especially, V (IV) is formed in the process of surface reactions with Ti-OH during the synthesis, and V (V) was initially existing in the precursor deposited on the surfaces of TiO2. Fig. 2e shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of the O 1s, which deconvoluted into two peaks, indicating TiO at 529.2 eV and non-lattice oxygen/OH 531.5 eV, respectively. This investigation clearly demonstrated the chemical composition and chemical state of GO/TiO2-V nanocomposite. TEM images of the synthesized nanoparticles and composites are shown in Fig. 3 (a–h). Fig. 3a illustrates the TEM image of TiO2 nanoparticles, which is homogeneous in shape and size of 25 ± 5 nm. Fig. 3(b,c,d) demonstrates the TEM images of vanadium doped TiO2 of different percentages (b-1%, c-2%, and d-3%), where the morphology of the nanomaterial remains unchanged. Fig. 3e represents the TEM images of the prepared nanocomposites GO/TiO2-V, where GO displays a wrinkle sheet-like structure. The vanadium doped TiO2 is homogeneously embedded on the Graphene oxide sheet. V doped TiO2 prevents the restacking of GO layered sheets that provide large specific area and beneficial fast charge transfer between GO and V doped TiO2. The lattice fringe image of 2% vanadium doped TiO2 with an interspacing distance of 0.295 nm is assigned to (101) plane of TiO2 (anatase) is shown in Fig. 3f, along with the SAED pattern that matches the XRD data. Fig. 3(g and h) shows the EDS analysis of 2% vanadium doped TiO2 and GO/TiO2-V, respectively. The presence of V, Ti, and O in 2% vanadium doped TiO2 and C, Ti, V, and O in GO/TiO2-V confirms the successful synthesis of TiO2-V dopant and nanocomposite. Fig. 4(a) shows the FTIR spectrum of CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V. The characteristics peak of pure PVA and CS is reported elsewhere. In CS/PVA, a shift in characteristics peak is found predominantly. The characteristic peak between 2850 and 3000 cm−1 corresponds to the CH stretching from alkyl groups of PVA. The absorption peaks at 1730 cm−1, 1680 cm−1, 1420 cm−1, 822 cm−1 are attributed to the CO and CO stretching from acetate group, CH bending, and CC stretching, respectively [49,50]. CS exhibits a -OH stretching vibration and amine NH symmetrical vibration between 3100 cm−1 to 3400 cm−1. Similarly, the characteristics peak between 1350 cm−1 to 1750 cm−1 corresponds to the amide I, II, and III bond stretching and bending vibration of CS [51]. Also, the major characteristic peaks around 850 cm−1, and 1149 cm−1 are attributed to the saccharide structure of CS [52]. Moreover, the shift in the characteristic peak of PVA and CS is due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and the existence of relevant functional groups conforms to the presence of PVA and CS in the composite [53]. As previously mentioned, the characteristic peak of GO/TiO2 −V (Fig. 1b) and CS/PVA is well exhibited in CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V nanocomposite patch (NCP). The major characteristics peak of GO with a minor deformation at 2924 cm−1, 1628 cm−1, 1379 cm−1, and 1220 cm−1 resemble the CH bond vibration, CO vibration mode, and skeletal vibration band CC and C–O–H stretching vibrations, respectively. Some peaks (epoxy and carboxyl functional group) are unobserved due to the overlap of PVA/SA absorption spectrum or reaction between epoxy and carboxyl functional group of GO in NCs with the amino group in CS [54]. At 460 cm−1, the peak matches to Ti-O-C bond vibration. A similar spectrum of GO/TiO2-V is also observed in NCP, which implies the effective bonding and immobilization of NCs in the fabricated NCP patch. The morphology and the microstructure of the fabricated CS/PVA patch and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch were analyzed through FESEM and shown in Fig. 4(b–e). Insets in Fig. 4(b and c) displays the gross images of the CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch. Fig. 4b shows the smooth and continuous surface of the CS/PVA patch. It indicates the complete homogenization of PVA and CS in the patch due to the hydrogen bond formation between the hydroxy group of PVA and the amino group of CS. No additional agglomerates or roughness is noted on CS/PVA patch. Unlike CS/PVA patch, CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-Vpatch Fig. 4(c and d) exhibits high roughness and crumpled structure on the topography of the surface that might be helpful for cell adhesion and proliferation. The nanocomposite (GO/TiO2-V) is well embedded and entrapped in the polymer and forms a denser structure by integrating within the polymer matrix that supports the improvised mechanical property. The NC is dispersed homogeneously throughout the fabricated patch. When compared with the plain patch NCP demonstrates high porosity on the surface. The presence of GO/TiO2-V in the NCP is confirmed in the EDS analysis, as shown in Fig. 4e. Bacterial infection is the leading cause for delay in wound healing, which means that the antibacterial activity of dressing should be evaluated as it is used for healing impaired wounds. The antibacterial activity of synthesized nanomaterials was evaluated against test bacterium (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and E. faecalis) under irradiation conditions (visible light) and in the dark. Irrespective of the stain, the synthesized nanomaterials show high antibacterial activity in the presence of light (PoL) when compare to the absence of light (AoL) with minor changes due to the difference in cell wall constituents between gram-negative and positive bacteria. It is summarized in Table 1 . TiO2 shows the least activity toward all test organisms with the MIC and MBC range of 32–46 μg/ml and 35–80 μg/ml in both AoL and PoL respectively which might be due to the larger bandgap of TiO2 (3.2 eV) that is active only in UV region. However, TiO2 shows dose-dependent antibacterial activity through ROS production that mineralizes the bacterial cell wall, leading to phospholipid peroxidation and causing apoptosis [55]. Similarly, for different percentages of vanadium doped TiO2, the activity was not found significant in AoL, and the activity range of MIC and MBC lies between 30 and 40 μg/ml and 58–82 μg/ml. However, in PoL the activity increases significantly for all the V doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The MIC and MBC reduces to an average of 8–15 μg/ml and 15–30 μg/ml. As the doping concentration increases the activity of V doped TiO2 increases. This could be due to the lower bandgap of V doped TiO2 that promotes visible light absorption, further increasing photocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 5a (schematics of visible light photocatalytic activity), V ions in the V doped TiO2 act as hole and electron traps in prohibiting the recombination of the electron-hole pair promoting ROS generation that results in significant antibacterial activity [56]. Further, GO/TiO2-V show high bacterial inhibition. The MIC in AoL and PoL is in the range of 20–25 μg/ml and 2.5–4.2 μg/ml. The enhanced activity attributes to various reasons like (a) GO-edge mediated slicing of the bacterial cell membrane, (b) as the particles sizes range between a few nm it adsorbed quickly to the cellular membrane via electrostatic attraction and causes intracellular oxidative stress and membrane stress (c) In PoL GO act as electron transfer bridge (interfacial charge-transfer reaction occurs), prevent the electron-hole pair recombination and accelerate electron transfer indeed results in high ROS generation, (d) the presence of the amino group, positive charge, (confirmed form FTIR Fig. 1b) in GO/TiO2-V can diffuse into bacteria (negative charge layer) and disrupt cytoplasmic membrane that leads to cell death [57–59]. Thus, the GO/TiO2-V nanocomposite shows high sensitivity toward all test bacterium and can be potentially implemented in wound dressing and healing applications. Additional to the MBC result, colony count analysis was carried out to confirm the antibacterial activity further. An example of colony count analysis for GO/TiO2-V for a particular concentration in PoL and AoL was shown in Fig. 5b. The concertation at which no colonies were observed is recorded, and the MBC values and summarized in Table 2 . In addition to the antibacterial activity of prepared nanocomposites, CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patches were also tested in the spread plate method. CS/PVA patch (data not shown) shows the least antibacterial activity. In contrast, CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch shows significantly higher activity with a zone of inhibition (ZoI) of 9–10 mm in all microorganisms as shown in Fig. 5c. This imitates that incorporating GO/TiO2-V in CS/PVA does not hinder the activity, further enhancing it due to the polycationic nature, molecular weight, and chelating property of the polymeric blend [60]. One of the most critical aspects of bacteria's infectivity is their quick reproduction period. This might be an excellent target for inhibiting a viable infection. As shown by the time-dependent growth inhibition assay in Fig. 6a, synthesized nanoparticles effectively inhibited bacterial growth in a time-dependent manner. Bacteria growth is divided into four stages: lag phase, log (exponential) phase, stationary phase, and death phase [61]. In gram-positive control bacteria (S. aureus and E. faecalis), the lag phase was prolonged for the initial 4 h in AoL and PoL. Still, in gram-negative (E. coli and P. aeruginosa), the lag phase is minimal. It is to be noted that PoL does not affect the control group. Compared to control in all test bacteria in AoL the bacteria growth was inhibited in the log (exponential phase) phase in the presence of nanocomposites and continued over time. Moreover, V doped TiO2 and pure TiO2 shows a similar trend in inhibiting bacterial growth with a slight increase in overall activity. For GO/TiO2-V nanocomposite, the stationary phase is witnessed until a 22-24th hour, and after which the death phase is initiated in all test organisms. In PoL, the inhibition trend changes as V doped TiO2 and GO/TiO2-V inhibit all bacterial growth initially (lag phase) and delay the exponential phase growth of the bacterial. This is attributed to ROS generation through photo-excitation that creates oxidative stress affecting the pathway for transcription and translation. In the presence of GO/TiO2-V, the stationary phase is significantly minimum in all bacteria, and the death phase occurs spontaneously at the 20th hour. Thus, this study reveals that bacteria in wounds can be inhibited from the initial lag phase onwards, which will reduce the inflammation period and fasten the healing process. Bacteria secrete protective extracellular polysaccharide matric (EPM). Biofilm creates a barrier for epithelialization and granulation tissue production, resulting in the low-grade inflammatory response that impedes wound healing [62]. Hence it is essential to analyze biofilm formation in the presence of nanomaterial to achieve the finest clinical performance. Fig. 6b show the biofilm formation for the synthesized nanomaterials in AoL (Fig. 6 (b.1)) and PoL (Fig. 6 (b.2)). In AoL, TiO2 and V doped TiO2 shows barely non-significant inhibition of 20% in all test bacterium. GO/TiO2-V indicates nearly 40% of biofilm inhibition. This observation contradicts the antibacterial activity (discussed above) in AoL of obtained nanomaterial. The key finding is that inhibition of biofilm formation was not attributed to the acute cytotoxicity caused by TiO2 or V doped TiO2 photoexcitation [63]. However, in PoL, biofilm formation in the presence of V doped TiO2 decreases to an average of 55% drastically. GO/TiO2-V inhibits almost 70% of the biofilm. This is due to the high generation of ROS through recombination of electron-hole pairs during photoexcitation. This ROS penetrates the bacterial colony's under layer, creating oxidative stress and leading to biofilm (EPM) destruction. Moreover, the significant decline in biofilm formation by GO/TiO2-V (in AoL and PoL) is due to the synergetic effect of primary amine and oxygenated groups along with the sharp edges that induce irreversible cell damage upon direct contact with bacteria [64,65]. Thus, the GO/TiO2-V shows high activity against biofilm formation irrespective of the stain. ROS has been shown to cause intracellular protein inactivation, oxidative imbalance, lipid peroxidation, peptide linkage rupture, mitochondrial malfunction, and progressive disintegration of the cell membrane followed by apoptotic process and cell death [66,57]. Since photocatalytic material (TiO2) and nanocomposites (V doped TiO2 and GO/TiO2-V) show antibacterial activity through ROS generation, the ROS level generated in bacteria is further examined in the presence and absence of light. Fig. 6c shows the ROS generation profile of the prepared nanomaterials in AoL (Fig. 6 (c.1)) and PoL (Fig. 6 (c.2)). In AoL the ROS generation is relatively low and similar in TiO2, and V doped TiO2. It corresponds to the large bandgap level that results in no electron/hole pair formation, and certainly, the level of ROS generation is partial. In GO/TiO2-V, the ROS level is comparatively high due to hydroxy and carboxyl groups that produce superoxide anion. In PoL the ROS generation level in TiO2 remains the same, but V doped TiO2 demonstrates a high level of ROS because of a reduction in bandgap energy. Visible-light-driven photocatalyst, due to the introduction of localized gap state (impurity energy level or new electronic state) formed between the CB and VB of TiO2, further enhancing the formation, transfer, and separation of photo generated electron/hole pairs. Moreover, GO/TiO2-V shows a high level of ROS generation than V- doped TiO2, as GO improves separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers, lower rate of recombination, larger surface area with the presence of hydroxy and carboxyl group yields in high production of free radicals further enhancing ROS generation. Fig. 7 shows the TEM images of all test organisms treated with MIC concentration of GO/TiO2-V in the presence and absence of light. In the control, the shape of gram-positive (rod, bacilli) and gram-negative (sphere, cocci) were well maintained with smooth morphology. In the presence of GO/TiO2-V (AoL) the NCs come in contact with the test bacteria initiating cell membrane damage and resulting in cytoplasmic leakage in all test bacteria (indicated with red arrow mark). In PoL, the NCs show high antibacterial activity through different means like aggregation at a particular site due to the formation of lipid domains around specific proteins, wrapping mechanism that causes lipid peroxidation, hinders cellular transportation and loss of membrane integrity, and diffuses inside the bacterial cell that enhances the contact between the bacteria and results in high ROS generation subsequently rupture the entire cell and cell membrane and causes irreversible cellular damage. The TEM images of the bacteria thus correlate with the above obtained antibacterial activity. Suitable mechanical properties (structural stability) are essential considerations for wound dressing to assist in healing tissue, consequential in skin repair [32]. Table 3 summarizes the overall mechanical property of the fabricated patch investigated in the dry and swollen state. CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch shows high tensile strength in dry (58.74 ± 1.3 MPa) and swollen state (23 ± 2.61) when compared to CS/PVA patch (49.36 ± 2.3, 9.47 ± 1.57). The incorporation of NCs has increased the tensile strength and Young's modulus of the patch even at the swollen state and maintains suitable mechanical property due to the reinforcing effect. Interactions between the NCs and the polymeric chain as hydrogen bonding interactions between OH and NH2 groups in the blends also participate in enhancing the mechanical properties [67]. Moreover, the homogenized structure can also be the reason for this improvement. Nevertheless, the presence of nanoparticles in the polymeric blend has decreased the elongation compared to CS/PVA patch. Even at swollen state CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V shows acceptable elongation and tensile strength, which might be due to the sliding effect of the GO sheet and the high aspect ratio of NCs. This leads to a more uniform stress scattering and diminishes the occurrence of the stress concentration. This further prevents the dressing from damage in day-to-day activities [68]. Overall, the above results suggest that CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch possesses adequate mechanical properties to be used as a wound dressing. CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch porosity was determined using the liquid displacement technique. The porosity of wound dressing material benefits in promoting a capillary force to the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients, thereby improving cell adhesion and proliferation [69]. CS/PVA shows porosity in the range between 76 and 79%, but for CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch porosity reduces to 63–65%. The porosity decline attributed to GO/TiO2-V NCs affecting the permeation of solvent molecules into the network. In the presence of NCs, the density of the fabricated patch increase. As density increases porosity reduces. The obtained porosity results of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch are well agreed with other physical and mechanical properties such as swelling, O2 permeability, MVTR, and degradation. Degradation decreased with a decrease in porosity, whereas mechanical property increases. The porosity value of 63–65% for CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch is sufficient to provide a suitable microenvironment for the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients, absorption of wound exudates, and promote reepithelization. Adequate oxygen level is necessary for the healing process as it promotes angiogenesis and collagen synthesis, produces growth factors and reactive oxygen species, and ensures effective leucocyte and fibroblast functioning [70]. Fig. 8a shows the outcome of oxygen permeability through CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patches. Negative and positive control shows a value of 7.83 ± 0.36 mg/l and 15.84 ± 0.41 mg/l respectively. CS/PVA oxygen permeability value was in the range of 13.23 ± 0.29 mg/l, whereas for CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V, it ranges at 11.48 ± 0.33 mg/l. Increased value for CS/PVA corresponds to the lower crystallinities of the polymeric blend, and the presence of hydroxy and carboxyl group increases the hydrophilic absorption further increasing the O2 permeability [71]. Further decline in values for NCP attributes to the integration of NCs with polymer, subsequent reducing the porosity and free hydroxy group. Thus, the test concludes that a sufficient level of oxygen can be permeable through CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch that can enhance tissue homeostasis, cell regeneration, mitochondrial function, and energy production. One of the ideal characteristics of wound dressing material is controlling the loss of moisture from the wound at an optimal rate. Higher MVTR ends up in dehydration of wound (ends up in scars formation and adhesion of dressing material in the wound), and lower MVTR results in accumulation of wound exudates (high risk of bacterial infection and tissue maceration), results in the delayed wound healing process. Thus, Adequate MVTR is essential to prevent excessive dehydration and the building up of exudates in wounds. According to Queen et al., the MVTR of an ideal wound dressing material ranges between 2000 and 2500 g (g/m2 24 h−1) [72]. Fig. 8b shows the MVTR of CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patches. The MVTR of the CS/PVA patch is in the range of 2142 ± 326.75 (g/m2 24 h−1). The MVTR of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch decreases by 1507 ± 239.51 (g/m2 24 h−1) due to the incorporation of NCs, which is well consistent with its tighter microstructure as discussed in the swelling study. Incorporating NCs provides higher interaction between the CS/PVA polymer, creating a homogenized distribution that makes a blocked interfacial void for moisture diffusion. Furthermore, existing commercial wound dressing has an MVTR range from 436 to 862 (g/m2 24 h−1) [73]. The obtained MVTR of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch is 1700 (g/m2 24 h−1). It is in the better acceptable range compared with the commercial products that facilitate optimal moisture content for the proliferation and function of epidermal and fibroblasts cells in the wound region and enhance re-epithelialization. Thus, CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch is an appropriate material for wound dressing application. The swelling properties of the patch play an essential role in upholding mechanical property, regulating cell adhesion, infiltration, and nutrient transportation. It is directly proportional to the patch's water holding or absorbing capacity influenced by the hydrophilic groups [74]. Fig. 8c shows the swelling percentage (water absorption) of CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patches. CS/PVA shows high swelling behaviour i.e., water absorption compared to CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch. Nearly 80% of swelling was noted on day one in CS/PVA, and it maximizes to 90% and stabilized from day 2. This high degree of swelling is due to the exposure of the hydrophilic group in polymer toward the water, resulting in creating a concentration gradient between the interface, that allows the water molecules to penetrate inside the patch and swell. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the hydroxy functional group of the polymers facilitates the swelling behaviour [75]. However, whereas in CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V, 45% of swelling was noted on day 1, and maximum swelling was obtained on day 4 with 50%. It is seen that the addition of nanocomposites has reduced the swelling capacity of the fabricated patch. This might be due to the strong intermolecular interaction between the cationic polysaccharide units of CS with negative charges (carboxyl and hydroxyl group) of GO that hinder the formation of hydrogen bond with the water molecules results in reduced swelling behaviour when compared to CS. Also, the interaction between the NCs and polymer is stronger and cannot be overcome by the water molecules' concentration gradient or osmatic pressure. Nevertheless, the NC patch shows an allowed swelling percentage that can be used in wound dressing application. After day 3, CS/PVA shows a reduction in swelling, which might be due to the degradation of the patch. However, NCP shows a gradual increase in swelling till day 6 and tends to reduce from day 7. This gradual swelling occurs as the polymer swells and degrades. The nanocomposites are exposed, and the water molecules occupy the free-charged sites to attain electro-neutrality [14,27]. FESEM (Fig. 8 (c)) analyses were carried on the patch to study morphology once the swelling is stabilized (on day 4). It is visible that as CS/PVA patch swells, the surface of the patch becomes uneven, and random bubble-like morphology is observed on the entire surface. Whereas in CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V, the absorption of water swells the polymer in the patch resulting in a much porous and moisture environment with hydrophilic nature that aids in cell adhesion and proliferation. However, CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch integrity is not lost even in the swelling state. Thus, the swelling behaviour of the fabricated NCP aid in absorbing the wound exudates that creates a microenvironment for cell migration and proliferation, and promotes the wound healing process. Degradation of wound dressing material ought to be controlled as it may create secondary impairment in the healing process [76]. Fig. 8d shows CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch degradation profiles. CS/PVA patch shows a higher degradation rate when compared to CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch. Nearly 70 ± 3.12% of degradation occurs on day 3 and it reached a maximum of 88 ± 2.2% on day 10. The swelling property also influences the sudden increase in the degradation rate. In Fig. 8c, the swelling of CS/PVA reached a maximum on day 2 and from day 3. As a result, swelling and degradation are significantly related. The intermolecular interaction between the polymer and PBS results in the initial swelling of the patch. Later, the interaction becomes weaker by the influence of external electrostatic force resulting in solvation and depolymerization, and hence degradation initiates. CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch exhibits a controlled degradation profile (10–50%) throughout the study due to the strong electrostatic interaction and intermolecular hydrogen bonding between CS/PVA and GO/TiO2-V. Furthermore, the strong chelation between NCs and CSs' hydrophilic groups enhances NCP's extended degradation profile. Further, the incorporation of NCs develops intermolecular polymeric interaction that hinders the incision sites for the activity of the fluid to degrade the polymer. Moreover, in association with the wound, the patch impairs and forms a gel-like structure that protects the wound, stimulates granulation and epithelialization, and creates space for cell proliferation [77,13]. Subsequently, the structure becomes porous and facilitates MVTR endorsing the wound healing process. Fig. 8d (inset) FESEM image of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch on day 11 (degradation stabilized) shows the surface of the NCP patch in which the degradation was visible. The NCs were well exposed with an increase in surface roughness and porosity. Still, the integrity of the patch is endured that can facilitate cell adhesion and migration by creating free space. CS/PVA patch tends to break due to high degradation and frangibleness, implying a reduction in mechanical property. Hence the fabricated patch is in good agreement with the wound dressing material properties. Cell toxicity is one of the most important markers for determining material biocompatibility. Considering wound dressing materials are frequently used as a temporary replacement for skin, it should be biocompatible. MTT assay (endpoint assay) was performed with NIH3t3 fibroblast in the presence of synthesized nanomaterials at different concentrations for 48 h, as shown in Fig. 9a (a.1(AoL) and a.2(PoL)) demonstrate that visible light irradiation has no effect on cell growth in the control group. TiO2 and V doped TiO2 showed concentration-dependent cell viability in AoL. The viability of cells reduces by less than 80% when the concentration exceeds 15 μg/ml. However, at lower concentrations (5–10 μg/ml), GO/TiO2-V promotes cell proliferation more than the control, however, at higher concentrations (>25 μg/ml), viability decreases beyond the biomaterial's permissible level (80%). The viability of cells in PoL is further reduced due to ROS formation by the synthesis sample's photocatalytic activity. However, TiO2 and V doped TiO2 exhibit minimal cell toxicity at low concentrations (5–10 μg/ml). However, as concentration increases, cell viability decreases dramatically. In AoL, up to 25 μg/ml of GO/TiO2-V may be administered, whereas, in PoL, 20 μg/ml demonstrates 80% cell viability, which is on the borderline. After 48 h of incubation in AoL and PoL, the result shows that GO/TiO2-V promotes fibroblast proliferation and enhances cell viability at the lowest concentration (20 μg /ml). However, because the ultimate product to be applied to the wound was still the fabricated patch (CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V), a cytotoxicity analysis was also conducted and shown in Fig. 9(a.3). CS/PVA patch shows a similar trend in cell viability as the control in AoL and PoL. Furthermore, CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch exhibits greater cell survival % than control (in both AoL and PoL), which might be ascribed to the patch's nano topography, which replicates the natural ECM, the availability of a larger surface area as compared to 2D cultures, and the presence of GO, which stimulates mechanical and chemical signals (integrin clustering and focal contact formation), optimal electrical activity and can accelerate cell proliferation. In addition to biocompatibility, the nanomaterial must be hemocompatible for effective administration (tropical and intravenous routes) in clinical (wound healing) applications as red blood corpuscles (RBCs) are the most abundant cell population in the blood (95%) and one of the most common nanomaterial translocation routes to various organs. Blood compatibility assay is excellent in vitro approach for estimating hemocompatibility. [78]. Fig. 9b (b.1(AoL) and b.2(PoL)) shows the hemolysis index (%) of RBCs incubated for a different time point (60,120 and 180 min) with TiO2, TiO2-V1, TiO2-V2, TiO2-V3, and GO/TiO2-V and CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V. The Hemolysis index values above the negative control are grouped into three types: (1) 0–2%, which reflects non-hemolysis, (2) 2–5%, which represents hemolysis mildly, and (3) >5%, which shows hemolysis. All samples exhibit minor hemolysis in AoL with an initial average of 1.3% hemolysis is observed in all samples at 60 min. As the incubation time increases to 120 and 180 min, it reaches a maximum of 3% and stabilizes. In PoL, V-doped TiO2 exhibits higher erythrocyte lysis of 3% at 60 min, 5% at 120 min, and 5.2% at 180 min on average which might be attributed to the polymorphs phase (anatase), free radicles produced by the photocatalytic nanomaterials [79]. However, compared to the other groups at each time point, CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V exhibits the least hemolysis activity in PoL and AoL that can be attributed to hemostatic effect induced by the chitosan and thereby eliminates the hemolytic effect [80]. This result signifies that the hemocompatibility improved dramatically in the nanocomposite patch. In addition, blood interaction with CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V is visualized through FESEM Fig. 9(b.3 and b.4), as the ultimate product is the patch. Samples after 3 h incubation (AoL and PoL) were used for FESEM analysis. The arrow marks indicate minimal erythrocyte lysis when CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V interacts with blood. It lies within the permissible limit. Adhesion of blood in the patch can be observed, which can be ascribed to the protonated amine groups of chitosan that attracted negatively-charged residues on red blood cell membranes creating strong hemagglutination (hemostasis), high activation of clotting cascade by crystalline nanoTiO2, and enhancing the activity of thrombin by GO. The synthesized patch absorbed blood fluids (fibrinogen and plasma proteins) on a pore, improving platelet aggregation intern aiding in quicker wound healing. Thus, the CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch might contribute to wound hemostasis and may shorten wound healing time. When compared with the antibacterial, cytotoxicity, and hemocompatibility of V doped TiO2, TiO2-V2 shows similar antibacterial activity like TiO2-V3 and minimum cell and blood toxicity in PoL. Whereas, TiO2-V3 demonstrates high cell toxicity. Thus TiO2-V2 was selected as an appropriate dopant concentration. Re-epithelialization is required for the effective repair of damaged tissue regions in wounds. Cell migration and proliferation are the primary causes of this process. The wound healing scratch test is performed to determine whether wound dressing material accelerates or delays wound healing in an in-vitro model and shown in Fig. 9(c and d). As CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V is introduced, the wound region shrinks considerably at both time points (12 and 24 h) compared to the control. At the 12th hour, 40 and 50% of wound closure can be observed in AoL and PoL respectively. However, only 20% of wound closure can be noticed in control. After 24 h, there was a significant increase in wound closure. In the presence of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch, 80% (AoL) and 90% (PoL) of the wound heals, whereas 60% is only cured in the control. To analysis, the movement of a fibroblast migration path, at the 6th hour, the plates were imaged. In Fig. 9e it was found that in the presence of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch, the cell migration is more predominating and aligned with a suitable spindle and elongated morphology which is mainly due to the wrinkle structure of GO that promotes signaling and enhance migration. Moreover, an increase in the migration of fibroblast call in the presence of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch without cellular cytotoxicity is mainly due to the adsorptions of proteins from the culture medium and cellular secretions, which interact with GO by van der Waals, hydrophobic, and π–π stacking interactions. This aids in electrical signaling and acts as multiple regulators between cells, the availability of higher surface area of GO that enhances cell adhesion. In addition, the nano features of the fabricated patch with an interconnected spongy network that mimics the natural ECM can also modulate cell behaviour and tissue response, which could lead to the migration and proliferation of fibroblast cells. Since the PoL induces more significant cell migration, cell adhesion and morphology of cells on CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch were investigated further in PoL after 24 and 72 h of incubation. Direct visualization of viable cells is essential in wound healing to evaluate the effect of scaffold conditions on cell behaviour. The morphology and cell adhesion are critical indicators of wound dressing patches. In accordance with CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V biocompatibility, cell adhesion and morphology were studied through a phase-contrast microscope and depicted in Fig. 9f. Fig. 9(f.1 and f.2) show the phase-contrast microscope images of cell adhesion after 24 and 72 h of incubation. The result indicates that cells are extensively and randomly spread with spindle morphology on CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V surface at 72 h while all the cells remain round and compact and tend to cluster at 24 h. After 72 h of incubation, it is visible that clustered cells align themselves on the patch, and an increase in cell adhesion and proliferation along with an elongated and spindle morphology is observed. This increase in cell density and adhesion can correspond to the presence of cationic sites on the chitosan chains that allow electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged surface of the cell membrane, resembling the natural ECM, and the immediate absorption of secreted protein [81,82]. Moreover, the presence of GO allows the non-covalent binding of proteins/keratinocyte inducers on its surface via hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions (chemical and mechanical signaling), or π − π interactions, and high wrinkled surface that promotes highly aligned cells proliferation [83,84]. In addition, hybrid polymeric nanocomposites with enhancing mechanical property and interfacial factors such as stiffness, surface charge, surface chemistry, roughness, and wettability influence cell adhesion and proliferation [85,86]. To conform that the adhered cells are alive, live/dead staining was performed in Fig. 9(f.3 and f.4). Higher cell viability with negligible cell death at 24 and 72 h was observed. The CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch demonstrated excellent mechanical and antibacterial property and in-vitro wound healing behaviour with high cell proliferation and adhesion. However, in-vitro studies lack the intrinsic complexity of entire organ systems. Hence in-vivo analyses were performed to understand better the true impact of CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch on the body (back) of Wistar rat. Fig. 10a illustrates the macroscopic images of the wound-healing process in the in-vivo model at a different time performed in three groups. Fig. 10b represents the quantitative evaluation of wound closure concerning different time points. Fig. 10c depicts CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch photos adhered to Wistar rat and exposed to visible light. The wound region steadily decreased in all groups over some time, but a significant reduction in the area was observed in group II from day 1. On day 6, an overall of 50 ± 2.85% wound closure was obtained. However, in groups I and III, 20 ± 2.15 and 28 ± 3.85% were obtained. At the end of the study (day 12), on an average of 92.56 ± 2.4%, wound closure was observed in group II, whereas group I and III exhibit only 63.26 ± 3.45% and 75.68 ± 3.12% wound closure respectively. Furthermore, on day 12, complete wound closure with negligible scar formation and smooth surface is observed in group II. Secondly, wounds were found to be moist and clean thought the healing process when compared to the other groupings. Wounds in the control and Tegaderm categories are dehydrated, might result in scar development at the end, and exudates' presence is noticed. The higher healing rate in group II when compared to other groups, might be attributable to various beneficial factors like the hydrophilic nature (swelling property) of the polymeric patch that enables faster absorption of blood components that promotes clotting and wound exudates that reduce the inflammatory stage. As CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch possesses high mechanical strength, O2 permeability, and low MVTR capacity, it keeps the wound moist with optimal O2 levels that aid in cell migration. The presence of nanocomposite (V doped TiO2 in GO/TiO2-V) in the patch has efficiently enhanced wound healing by its photocatalytic antibacterial property and by promoting growth factors (TGF, SMA). Moreover, the presence of GO enhances the electrostatic interaction between cells, as discussed earlier. The absorption of proteins and growth factors in the polymeric patch mimics the ECM and aid in faster reepithelization and maturation of tissue. As a result, CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V significantly improved wound healing and reduced scar formation as depicted in Fig. 10d. Further histological analysis (H&E and Masson's trichrome) was performed to entirely analyze the wound healing behaviour of the dressing material, which provides information on essential components of the healing process such as cell inflammation, restoration of the connective tissue matrix, remodeling, cell differentiation, and reepithelization. Fig. 10e (e.1–e.6) shows the H&E section performs on the different groups on the 12th day postoperatively. A significant reduction in overall inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and granulation tissue was observed in the animals treated with CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch in group II compared to group I and III. Furthermore, compared to group I and III, a wound treated with CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch (group II) showed healthy keratinocytes and intact epidermal layers covered with mature granulation tissue and collagen, with substantial production of rete ridges, dermal glands, and hair follicles. When a skin wound occurs, a neo formative fibroblast with minimal collagen replaces the necrotic tissue. If the collagen content rises, fibroblasts in microanatomy transform into fibrocytes, and the wound heals. As a result, it is crucial to measure collagen deposition during wound healing. Masson's trichrome staining Fig. 10f revealed that wound treated with CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch (group II) shows higher collagen density when compared to other groups. Moreover, CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch (group II) shows the efficient generation of hair follicles, blood vessels, sebaceous glands, and enhanced deposition of aligned mature collagen bundles that resemble normal skin compared to control (group I) and Tegaderm (group III). Moreover, we measured the hydroxyproline content of the wounded skin in each group at the end of the experiment to quantitatively estimate the total collagen content in the skin samples since hydroxyproline is unique in collagen fibers and its mass fraction is constant (13.4%) in collagen. As shown in Fig. 10g, compared group I and III, CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch (group II) exhibited superior collagen level. This is well in accordance with Masson's trichrome staining analysis. In addition to it, pathological imaging (H&E) Fig. 10h was also conducted to evaluate the influence of the patch on key organs such as the liver, kidney, and spleen. There was no visible damage, indicating that no nephrotoxic or hepatotoxic impact was observed in organs, particularly the liver, spleen, and kidneys. These histological results indicate that CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch efficiently promoted the wound-healing process by accelerating re-epithelization, promoting blood-vessel and hair-follicle formation, and subsequently facilitating granulation-tissue growth and collagen deposition."
23,Conclusion,"In summary, GO/TiO2-V was synthesized and made into CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch by cost-efficient sol-gel technique. The synthesized nanocomposite and patch were well characterized. The presence of GO/TiO2-V nanocomposite in the CS/PVA patch has tremendously increased the mechanical strength, optimal MVTR and O2 permeability, suitable swelling and degradation property, providing an ideal moist environment for wound healing. Increased antibacterial activity of the patch was witnessed in presence of light from antibacterial assays. The in-vitro study supported that CS/PVAP/GO/TiO2-V is biocompatible, enhances cell migration and adhesion, and is hemocompatible with blood clotting behaviour. Moreover, in presence of light, the migration of fibroblast cells is more predominating and aligned with a suitable spindle and elongated morphology that attributes to the wrinkle structure of GO that promotes signaling and enhances migration and adhesion. In-Vivo wound healing experiments on Wistar rats revealed that the CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch heals wounds rapidly with balanced inflammatory infiltration, greater granulation tissue thickness, higher density fibroblasts, and collagen deposition than control and commercial dressing. It also has outstanding re-epithelization and dense collagen deposition capabilities as observed from histological studies. The increased antibacterial property and physio-mechanical property of the patch to remove pathogenic bacteria on the wound region and maintain a sterile wound healing environment might be the underlying cause for its quicker wound healing characteristics. Thus CS/PVA/GO/TiO2-V patch can be a promising unique multifunctional wound healing material."
