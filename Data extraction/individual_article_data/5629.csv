0,Introduction,"The pioneering work of Chen et al. [1] on hydrogen reduction of anatase TiO2 for photocatalysis has triggered enormous research activities due to the great improvement in solar light photocatalytic activities [2–14]. The obtained black TiO2 absorbs in the solar spectral range, and shows stable water splitting rate. After these initial studies, numerous efforts, involving the investigation of reduction methods [7,8,10,15], design of new structured black TiO2 materials [3,4,8,10,11], mechanistic studies [5,6,9,16], and extension to other systems [17–19], were invested to improve photocatalytic performance. Among these approaches, the design of new mesostructured materials with high surface areas seems to be one of the most promising ones, because most of the black TiO2 materials studied so far are based on commercial TiO2 (P25), and have relatively low surface areas of about 50 m2 g−1. Therefore, many studies have focused on the design of new nanostructures to enhance their surface area and electron conductivity. These nanostructures include nanowires [3,20], nanotubes [21], microspheres [10], and single crystals [22]. However, most of the synthetic methods involve quite complicated strategies, which make their use on a large scale difficult. Therefore, a general method to prepare black TiO2 with high surface area, high crystallinity, and controllable morphology is still a challenge. Mesoporous materials possess high surface areas and uniform and tunable pore sizes. They can be synthesized with various structures, and a multitude of compositions, which make them suitable for potential applications in catalysis [23–26], adsorption [27], sensing [28], lithium-ion batteries [29,30] and many other areas [31,32]. Among these materials, mesoporous titanias are among the most investigated systems, because of their fascinating features, such as excellent electronic and optical properties, high surface areas, and low cost [33–39]. There are mainly two methods to prepare ordered mesoporous TiO2. The soft templating method involves surfactants or block co-polymers as structure directing agents. An alternative method uses pre-formed mesoporous silica or carbon as a template and is called hard-templating (or nanocasting). Soft-templating allows access to mesoporous TiO2 with well-ordered mesostructure and high surface area. However, often the structures are not very stable at high temperatures due to the tendency of TiO2 growth to large crystals. If the materials are treated only at moderate temperatures, the frameworks are only amorphous or semi-crystalline. Therefore, there were substantial efforts to enhance the thermal stability of mesoporous TiO2 [40]. Zhou et al. [11] use an ethylenediamine assisted, modified soft-templating method to prepare mesoporous black TiO2 with a surface area of 124 m2 g−1, which shows enhanced photocatalytic activity for solar light water splitting. Alternatively, the hard-templating can also be used to prepare mesoporous TiO2 [41,42]. Compared to soft templating, the hard-templating method has several advantages [32], (a) the particle sizes of the replica materials can be controlled by judicious choice of templates with different pore sizes; (b) control of the complex hydrolysis-condensation process, which normally involves controlling of humidity and temperature is not required; (c) highly crystalline, nanostructured materials with crystalline framework can be formed within the template pore channels without loss of their structural ordering at high temperature, and (d) by using different mesostructured materials as hard templates, different replica structures are accessible. Mesoporous silica is normally used as hard template for preparing mesoporous materials. However, the silica template is not suitable for those materials that can react with silica or are not stable during the template removal process. Mesoporous carbon [43–45], which possesses extremely high surface are (up to 3000 m2 g−1) and high stability in inert atmosphere (>1000 °C), is more suitable as a hard template for preparing mesoporous TiO2 [46]. More importantly, the template can simply be burnt out in air without using complicated solution based methods. Herein, we demonstrate the nanocasting of mesoporous TiO2 with an ordered mesostructure, highly crystalline and thermally stable framework, and high surface area by using mesoporous carbon CMK-3 as a hard template. The carbon templated mesoporous TiO2 has a surface area as high as 158 m2 g−1, a pore volume up to 0.62 cm3 g−1, and a tunable pore size between 4.9 and 5.6 nm. After exposure to hydrogen at 500 °C for 3 h, the obtained mesoporous black TiO2 exhibits a photocatalytic water splitting performance under solar light of up to 188 μmol h−1, which is more than two times higher than that of commercial TiO2 (P25) (82 μmol h−1) for this reaction. Furthermore, 500 °C was identified as the optimal temperature for the preparation of mesoporous TiO2. The pore confinement of the mesoporous carbon template is used to create TiO2 with different crystallinity and textural parameters. This represents a model system for water splitting to explore and evaluate physical key parameters for the water splitting reaction and for understanding the structural characteristics affecting the photocatalytic performance."
1,Experimental section,"Synthesis of CMK-3 template: Highly ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3 was prepared by the nanocasting method with SBA-15 [47,48] as a hard template according to our previous method [49,50]. Furfuryl alcohol (FA) dissolved in trimethylbenzene (TMB) was used as carbon precursor, and oxalic acid was used as a polymerization catalyst. The FA solution (50 vol%) was infiltrated into the pore channels of SBA-15 by incipient wetness impregnation at room temperature with a solution to pore volume ratio of 1.2, followed by polymerization at 50 °C for 24 h then 90 °C for 48 h. Afterwards, the composite was treated in argon flow at 150 °C for 4 h, then heated to 300 °C with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. Finally, the temperature was increased to 850 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and maintained at that temperature for 4 h. The silica template was leached out with 2 M NaOH at 70 °C. Synthesis of mesoporous TiO 2 : Ordered mesoporous TiO2 was prepared by the nanocasting method with CMK-3 as a hard template. Typically, 4.9 mL titanium isopropoxide was dissolved in 20 mL of acetic acid. Then 5 g of CMK-3 was added under vigorous stirring. The titania precursor was incorporated into the pore channels of CMK-3 by evaporation induced capillary filling at 100 °C under stirring. Afterwards, the composite was heated at 500, 600 and 700 °C, respectively, for 1 h in nitrogen flow to transform the titania precursor into crystalline TiO2. Finally, the carbon template was removed by simple calcination in air at 500 °C for 3 h. The samples are denoted as meso-TiO2-X, where X = 500, 600 or 700. Hydrogen treatment and Pt loading: The hydrogen treatment of mesoporous TiO2 was performed at 500 °C for 3 h under hydrogen flow with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The color of the mesoporous TiO2 changed from white to dark grey during the hydrogenation process, suggesting the formation of black TiO2. The samples obtained were denoted as black-meso-TiO2-X (X = 500, 600, or 700). After that, 1 wt.% Pt was loaded by incipient wetness impregnation. Typically, 0.2 g of the black TiO2 and a calculated amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O were dispersed in 3 mL of distilled water. Then the solvent was evaporated at 70 °C under magnetic stirring. Finally, the obtained composite was treated with hydrogen at 500 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The hydrogen flow rate was set to 100 mL min−1, and remained constant until cooling to room temperature. The Pt loaded samples are denoted as Pt/black-meso-TiO2-X (X = 500, 600, or 700). Characterization and Measurements: Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a StoeSTADI P θ-θ diffractometer operating in reflection mode with Cu Kα 1,2 radiation and a secondary graphite monochromator. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were performed on a NOVA 3200e instrument at 77 K. Prior to the measurements, all samples were degassed under vacuum for at least 6 h at 150 °C. BET surface areas were calculated from the data in a relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.20. By using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) algorithm, the pore volumes and pore size distributions were derived from the adsorption branches of the isotherms. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) investigations were taken under both conventional TEM (CTEM) mode and scanning TEM (STEM) mode, using an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 operating at 200 kV. To get more information about the particles, high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) was performed. High-resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) images were taken on a Hitachi S-5500 ultrahigh-resolution cold field emission scanning microscope with an accelerating voltage at 15 kV. All continuous wave (cw) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed at room temperature on a Bruker ElexsysE500 spectrometer and a ST9402 resonator. The microwave frequency amounted to 9.65 GHz. A microwave power of 2 mW and a modulation amplitude of either 0.1 mT or 0.5 mT was used. The UV–vis DRS measurement was performed at room temperature on a Lambda 365 UV/Vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer) equipped with an 50 mm integrating sphere and using BaSO4 as reference with 600 nm/min scan rate. H 2 evolution experiment: The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments were conducted in an online photocatalytic hydrogen generation system at ambient temperature (25 °C). Photocatalyst (100 mg) loaded with Pt (1 wt.%) was suspended in a mixture of 40 mL of water and 20 mL of methanol in a closed-gas circulation reaction cell by using a magnetic stirrer. Prior to the reaction, the mixture was deaerated by evacuation to remove O2 and CO2 dissolved in water with argon. An AM 1.5 solar power system (solar simulator LCS-100, Newport, USA) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (81088A-LCS, Newport, USA) was used as light irradiation source. A cut-off filter (Newport, 20CGA-420; λ > 420 nm) was employed to cut off the UV light irradiation. Gas evolution was observed only under photo-irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2, being analyzed with a multi-channel analyzer (Emerson X-Stream) equipped with a detector for the determination of the concentration of hydrogen (thermal conductivity detector), oxygen (paramagnetism) and carbon dioxide (Infrared detector-IR). Argon was used as a carrier gas with a continuous gas flow set to 50 mL min−1 (Bronkhorst mass flow controller). The hydrogen evolution value is calculated based on 100 mg of the catalyst. The long-time stability test was measured under AM 1.5 at the same conditions continuously interrupted with 5 dark phases of 20 min without replenishing water and methanol."
2,Results and discussion,"The mesoporous CMK-3 template was prepared with SBA-15 as hard template in large scale (8.0 g in one batch) and with furfuryl alcohol as carbon precursor by the nanocasting method (Fig. 1 ) [32]. The morphology of SBA-15 is shown in Fig. S1. The resultant CMK-3 with highly ordered 2-dimensional (2D) hexagonal mesostructure has a high specific surface area (1133 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (1.00 cm3 g−1) (Supporting Information Fig. S2 and Table 1 ). The pore size calculated from the adsorption branch (desorption branch, which is normally recommended, might be affected by capillary criticality) of the nitrogen sorption isotherm by using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) algorithm is about 3.0 nm, which agrees very well with the pore wall thickness of the SBA-15 template. The ordered mesoporous TiO2 was synthesized according to the procedure shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, the titania precursor was incorporated into the mesopore channels of CMK-3 by an evaporation induced capillary filling. Then the precursor was transformed into TiO2 at different temperatures (500, 600 and 700 °C) under argon atmosphere inside the carbon pore channels. Finally, the carbon template was removed by calcination at 500 °C in air. The obtained materials are denoted as meso-TiO2-X (X = 500, 600 or 700, indicating the titania formation temperatures). The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 2 ) of meso-TiO2-500 shows well-resolved broad reflections that can be assigned to the anatase phase (PDF2 entry 46–1237), indicating well-crystallized nanomaterials. However, the low-angle XRD pattern (Fig. S3) only shows one weak reflection at around 1.7°, suggesting significant degradation of the mesostructure during the two step nanocasting process. With increasing the heat treatment temperature to 600 °C, the wide-angle XRD pattern (Fig. 2, curve (b)) shows a group of new, weak reflections which can be assigned to the rutile phase (PDF2 entry 33–1381). This indicates a phase transformation. The phase transformation temperature is, however, much lower than that of mesoporous TiO2 material synthesized by the soft-templating method [11]. Further increase in the temperature to 700 °C results in sharpening of the reflections, suggesting the increase of the crystalline domain size. No clear low-angle XRD patterns could be detected for meso-TiO2-600 and −700. HR-SEM images of the TiO2 prepared at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3 . Almost all the obtained TiO2 particles have rod-like morphology, which is replicated from the CMK-3 template, which in turn has originated from SBA-15, indicating good replication of the carbon template. Each single particle is composed of bundles of string-of-pearl-like nanowires. The nanowires are packed in a fairly ordered manner which can be considered as a result of the 2D hexagonal structure of the templates used. However, the single nanoparticles are bigger than the pore size of CMK-3 for all the samples, suggesting an increase in particle size during the heat treatment. The TEM images (Fig. 4 ) of the replica TiO2 confirm the ordered nanowire bundle structure. The HR-TEM images clearly reveal the crystalline nature of the mesoporous TiO2. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 4c and f) of meso-TiO2-500 and meso-TiO2-600 show that the TiO2 materials have a poly-crystalline framework with a dominant anatase phase. However, the SAED pattern of meso-TiO2-700 (Fig. 4j) shows a few single crystals only, suggesting that big crystals were formed during the high temperature treatment. This confirms the HR-SEM observation. The particle size distributions (Fig. 4 insets) of the small TiO2 crystals, which form the nanowires, are calculated to be 9.5, 16.5 and 35.0 nm for meso-TiO2-500, 600 and 700, respectively. These crystal sizes are larger than the void size in CMK-3, indicating TiO2 crystal growth after template destruction. This can explain the loss in the mesoscale ordering of these materials, as demonstrated by the low-angle XRD results. However, the general replication of the nanostructure suggests that the TiO2 particles are grown primarily inside the pore channels of CMK-3. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. S4) of the replica TiO2 materials obtained at different temperatures are rather similar. They are characterized by moderate capillary condensation at relative pressures around 0.2–0.8 that is attributed to adsorption in mesopores that were generated by the removal of the CMK-3 carbon template, and the voids between the TiO2 crystals. Another capillary condensation step at higher relative pressure at above 0.8, related to larger pores, can be attributed to voids between the particles and/or due to the partially incomplete replication of the carbon template. The corresponding BET surface areas (Table 1) for meso-TiO2-500, 600 and 700 are 158, 131 and 99 m2 g−1, respectively. These specific surface areas are relatively high, considering the high density of TiO2 (∼4 g cm−3) and the low level of microporosity. The total pore volumes are 0.62, 0.45 and 0.32 cm3 g−1 for 500, 600 and 700 °C treated samples, which are much higher than those of soft-templated mesoporous TiO2 [11]. After hydrogen treatment at 500 °C for three hours, the meso-TiO2-500 changes from white to dark grey (Fig. 5 a and b), indicating that the TiO2 surface was reduced, so that mesoporous black TiO2 was formed. The UV–vis spectra of meso-TiO2-500 before and after hydrogen treatment were shown in Fig. S5. After the hydrogen treatment, the black-meso-TiO2-500 has a broad, unspecific reduced reflection. However, the wide-angle XRD pattern (Fig. S6a) of the black-meso-TiO2-500 still shows well-defined diffraction peaks of the anatase phase, and the specific surface area determined by BET method is only slightly decreased from 158 to 154 m2 g−1 (Fig. S4d and Table 1), suggesting high stability of the mesoporous structure during the high temperature hydrogen treatment. 1 wt.% Pt co-catalyst was loaded onto the black-meso-TiO2-500 by wet impregnation, followed by H2 reduction at 500 °C. The wide-angle XRD pattern (Fig. S6) of Pt/black-meso-TiO2-500 shows very similar diffraction peaks compared to black-meso-TiO2-500 material. No Pt reflections are observed, which may be due to the low loading amount and/or small particle size. TEM and HR-TEM images (Fig. S7) of the Pt/TiO2 before and after photocatalytic reaction show the ordered nanowire array structure, further proving the high stability of the mesoporous TiO2 materials. Small crystalline nanoparticles, the lattice fringes of which can be assigned to Pt, are also observed in the TEM images. The platinum particles are highly dispersed on the nanowires of TiO2, and have sizes around 2–5 nm. The Ti3+ species in black TiO2 were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with a Bruker ElexsysE500 system. The EPR spectrum (Fig. 6 A trace a) of mesoporous pristine TiO2 (meso-TiO2-500) shows a nearly straight line, suggesting a typical TiO2 material without any paramagnetic centers. However, after hydrogen treatment, the EPR spectrum (Fig. 6A trace b) of black-meso-TiO2-500 shows a strong signal at g = 2.004, indicating the formation of a high concentration of Ti3+ [7]. The hydrogen generation properties of mesoporous TiO2 templated by mesoporous carbon CMK-3 and of commercial P25 after hydrogen treatment and Pt loading were evaluated under AM 1.5 (Fig. 6B) with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 based on 0.10 g of the catalyst (with methanol as sacrificial donor). The meso-TiO2-500 showed a surprisingly high photocatalytic activity with a hydrogen generation rate of 188 μmol h−1, which is more than two times higher than that of commercial P25 (82 μmol h−1). This performance is among the best of recent reports (Table S1). Sample meso-TiO2-600 shows a lower hydrogen generation rate (148 μmol h−1), which may be due to the decrease in surface area and the formation of the less active rutile phase during the higher temperature treatment (Table 1 and Fig. 2). For meso-TiO2-700 with a higher fraction of the rutile phase in the sample, the hydrogen generation rate drops further to 109 μmol h−1, which is still higher than that of P25, due to its higher surface area (99 m2 g−1). This observation suggests that the formation of the rutile phase reduces the photocatalytic activity. The short-time measurements may give misleading results, if the steady states are reached only slowly. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution test for the meso-TiO2-500 catalyst was performed under AM 1.5 for 25 h interrupted by 5 dark phases of 20 min. Fig. 6C shows the photocatalytic activity of meso-TiO2-500, which shows an initial hydrogen generation rate of 188 μmol h−1. Then it slowly drops to 180 μmol h−1 within 4 h. When the light was shut off at 4 h, the hydrogen generation rate dropped to nearly zero and increases back to the value before the light was shut off upon illuminating the sample again. This process was repeated for several times without replenishing water and methanol. The hydrogen generation rate is still as high as 157 μmol h−1 after 25 h. The gradual decrease of the hydrogen evolution rate is most likely due to the decrease in pH value and the decrease in methanol concentration due to consumption and evaporation [51,52]. In order to understand the origin of the photocatalytic activity in more detail, a series of comparison tests was performed. The hydrogen generation performances of mesoporous TiO2 with and without hydrogen reduction at 500 °C under visible light (λ > 420 nm) are shown in Fig. 7 A. Mesoporous TiO2 without hydrogen reduction shows no any detectable hydrogen production within the initial two hours (Fig. 7Ab), which is similar to that of the blank curve (Fig. 7Ac). However, after hydrogen reduction, the black-meso-TiO2-500 shows a promising visible photocatalytic activity of 6 μmol h−1, indicating that the hydrogen reduction treatment can enhance the visible light (λ > 420 nm) absorption. Furthermore, we also compared the photocatalytic activities of mesoporous TiO2 catalysts before and after hydrogen reduction treatment under the whole solar light range (AM 1.5) (Fig. 7B). The hydrogen generation rate of black-meso-TiO2-500 and meso-TiO2-500 are 188 μmol h−1 and 43 μmol h−1, respectively, which indicates that the hydrogen reduction treatment not only enhances the absorption in the visible light range but also significantly improves the UV light range absorption capacity of solar light. The high photocatalytic activity of this mesoporous TiO2 may have a relation to the synthesis method and the resulting nanoscale framework. There are several remarkable points for the fabricated mesoporous black TiO2: (a) The small crystalline domain size. The mesoporous carbon CMK-3 with high surface area (1113 m2 g−1), large pore volume (1.00 cm3 g−1) and uniform mesopore size (3.0 nm) makes the filling of the titania precursor into the pore channels easy. Therefore, not many big crystals are formed outside of the pores. Furthermore, due to the confinement effect of the rigid carbon framework, the TiO2 nanoparticles have small particle sizes, which can increase specific interfacial surface areas between water and the photocatalyst. (b) Facile reducibility. Since the 500 °C treated sample has the highest surface area and a crystalline framework, the surface reduction of mesoporous TiO2 should be easier than for the samples treated at higher temperatures. In addition, the carbon template present during the thermal treatment step may also partially reduce the TiO2 surface. (c) Open framework. The nanowire array structure of the mesoporous TiO2 possesses a larger pore size and a more open framework compared with titania obtained by the soft-templating route [11]. The Pt co-catalyst could easily be loaded into the pore channels. Additionally, photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 depends on the lifetime of charge carriers generated on its surface. After the reduction treatment, surface recombination of generated charge carriers can be inhibited by the modified TiO2 which will improve the photocatalytic activity [53]. More importantly, the open framework also promotes the ion and hydrogen gas transport through the mesopore channels, which is partially responsible for the high hydrogen generation rate."
3,Conclusion,"In summary, mesoporous TiO2 nanowire bundles have been fabricated by a two-step nanocasting method. The obtained mesoporous TiO2 has a high surface area of up to 158 m2 g−1, a large pore volume of up to 0.62 cm3 g−1, tunable and large pore size (5–6 nm), and highly crystalline anatase framework. The crystalline framework of the mesoporous TiO2 obtained at relatively low temperature (500 °C) allows easy surface reduction. The open framework of this material significantly promotes the accessibility of the TiO2 nanoparticles; it also facilitates fast diffusional transport of guest ions and formed hydrogen bubbles. The mesoporous black TiO2 shows a significant increase of the Ti3+ signal in EPR after the hydrogen treatment. Likely as a result of this, the material exhibits a remarkably high photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate of up to 188 μmol h−1 under AM 1.5, which is more than two times higher than that of commercial P25 (82 μmol h−1). More importantly, the pore confinement of the carbon template creates a TiO2 catalyst with different crystallinity and textural parameters that can be used a model system for water splitting."
