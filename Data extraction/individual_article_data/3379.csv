0,Introduction,"Depletion of global oil and increasing climate warming has triggered the need for novel green and safe biofuels for replacing traditional fossil fuels [1]. Biodiesel is a green and clean biofuel that is characterized by renewability, excellent environmental performance, and sufficient combustion. It is either a fatty acid methyl ester or a fatty acid ethyl ester formed via the transesterification of animal, vegetable, or microbial oils and alcohols (methanol and ethanol, respectively) [2]. Presently, compared with physical and chemical methods, the use of enzymatic process in biodiesel production has great advantages owing to their low energy consumption, high product purity, mild reaction conditions, simple product post-processing, lower by-product production, and environmental friendliness as well as the catalysis of a wide range of raw oils including wet and acid feedstock [3,4]. Numerous studies have reported the preparation of biodiesel using lipases as catalysts, among them, bacterial thermophilic lipases show relatively high enzyme activity [5]. Specifically, Geobacillus thermocatenulatus lipase 2 (GTL2), which shows thermal stability, organic solvent tolerance, and strong adaptability to oils substrates, has been widely used in biodiesel production, and its protein structure as well as its biochemical properties have been investigated in several studies [6–8]. However, owing to certain disadvantages, including instability at high temperatures, difficulty of recycling, limited tolerance to solvents, and different pH conditions, the large-scale application of free lipases in the biodiesel industry is limited [9]. Enzyme immobilization has proven to be an efficient method for enhancing catalytic performance. Furthermore, current researches mainly focus on modification and improvement of enzyme features, such as activity, stability, selectivity, specificity, and resistance to inhibitors, chemicals, and reaction system components [10]. For example, to enhance enzymatic activity by interface activation of lipase, Hu et al. [11] developed a hydrophobic carrier; and via directed evolution, researchers have fused the self-crystallizing protein on lipase to achieve enzyme immobilization in vivo [12]. Although these immobilizing carriers can realize the effectiveness of lipase immobilization and are beneficial in improving enzyme activity, their industrial application is limited by tedious synthesis process and poor controllability [13]. Therefore, development of a green and simple lipase immobilization carrier is a priority. With the application of both structural bionics and process bionics in the design and preparation of carriers, a new type of bionic carrier has been developed [14]. Certain organisms can use protein as a skeleton to generate hard, composite, inorganic materials; and when the formation process of silica is known as bio-silicification [15,16]. Owing to its high specific surface area and controllable pore size, silica is widely used as an inert and stable carrier for enzyme immobilization [17], which provides a simple, fast, and flexible method for the bionic-immobilized enzyme. Specifically, the utilization of bio-silicification during enzyme immobilization involves the use of induced proteins as templates to promote the reaction of silica formation. This can help prevent damage to the natural enzyme conformation caused by acid-base catalysts and high temperatures in the traditional immobilization process, and this is beneficial in maintaining enzyme activity [18]. In addition, bionic-immobilization is characterized by mild conditions, flexibility and controllability, rapid response, high embedding rates, low costs, diverse morphology, and outstanding stability, and it has been successfully applied to realize the immobilization of various enzymes [19]. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a green and simple method by which lipase immobilization can be realized, and thereafter, apply the resulting immobilized lipase in biodiesel production. Specifically, in this study, recombinant GTL2, which is heterologously expressed in E. coli, was bionic-immobilized in silica for analyzing its lipase immobilization efficiency as well as the corresponding activity recovery. Subsequently, the mechanism of the interaction between the carrier and the lipase was also explored via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Additionally, the stability of the bionic-immobilized lipase was evaluated, and finally, it was used to catalyze biodiesel production from rapeseed oil, and its potential application value was also evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of purified recombinant lipase,"2.1 Preparation of purified recombinant lipase For the preparation of recombinant GTL2, an engineered E. coli harboring the lipase gene, GTL2, from G. thermocatenulatus was cultured as previously described [7]. First, isolated single clones were cultured overnight at 37 °C in 200 mL of LB medium as the fermentation seeds. This fermentation medium comprised of yeast extract (11.5 g/L), peptone (19.5 g/L), glucose (10 g/L), KH2PO4 (3 g/L), K2PO4 (18 g/L), (NH4)2SO4 (4 g/L), MgSO4 (1.2 g/L), and a trace element solution (1 mL/L). The microelement stock, which was prepared in 1 M HCl solution (1 L) consisted of FeSO4·7H2O (2.8 g), MnCl2·4H2O (2 g), CoSO4·7H2O (2.8 g), CaCl2·2H2O (1.5 g), CuCl2·2H2O (0.2 g), ZnSO4·7H2O (0.3 g). The seeds were inoculated in a 7 L fermentation bank (Shanghai Baoxing Bio-engineering Equipment Co., Ltd, China) containing 5 L of fermentation medium and were cultured for 18 h at 37 °C and 180 rpm, followed by another 6 h cultivation at 30 °C and 150 rpm after the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. During fermentation, fed-batch cultivates consisted of 50% glucose (500 g/L) and 50% ammonium hydroxide. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 8.0) via ultrasonic wave treatment. The supernatant containing the crude enzyme was collected after cryogenic centrifugation (4 °C), and the recombinant protein was purified via affinity chromatography using a nickel column. Finally, the purified protein was qualitatively analyzed using SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was also quantitatively determined using OD562 assay [7]."
3,Lipase activity analysis,"2.2 Lipase activity analysis Lipase activity was determined by calculating the amount of ρ-nitrophenol (ρNP) generated in the reaction solution containing 20 mM ρ-nitrophenylpalmitate (ρNPP) dissolved in isopropanol at 60 °C using 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 8.0) for 5 min. One unit was defined as the amount of recombinant GTL2 that hydrolyzed the release of 1 µmol ρNP per min. The concentration of ρNP was measured using OD410 assay [7]. An inactivated lipase solution was used as the blank control, and all experiments were performed in duplicates."
4,Bionic-immobilization and the optimization of its conditions,"2.3 Bionic-immobilization and the optimization of its conditions For bionic-immobilization, 126 µL of 1 M tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) was added to 1070 µL of 0.5 mM HCl at 25 °C and 150 rpm for 15 min, followed by the addition of 500 µL of the purified recombinant GTL2 into the reaction mixture (6 mg/mL, 50 mM PBS), which was then incubated in an ice batch for 60 min at 150 rpm. Subsequently, the gel-like sample was resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 12000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Thereafter, the supernatant and the precipitate were collected after washing three times. The obtained precipitate was the bionic-immobilized lipase, and the collected supernatant was used to determine the protein concentration to calculate the immobilization efficiency according to Eq. 1. Meanwhile, the enzyme activity recovery of the bionic-immobilized lipase was calculated according to Eq. 2. Additionally, to improve the immobilization efficiency by further optimizing the bionic-immobilization conditions, the effects of HCl concentration (0.05–5 mM), TMOS amount (0.1–5 mM), PBS buffer concentration (25–500 mM), and enzyme amount (2–30 mg/mL) on the immobilization efficiency were investigated. Immobilization e f f i c i e n c y % = C protein a d d e d d u r i n g i m m o b i l i z a t i o n - C protein r e m a i n i n g i n t h e s u p e r n a t a n t / C protein a d d e d d u r i n g i m m o b i l i z a t i o n × 100 % (1)where C represents protein content. (2) Activity r e c o v e r y ( % ) = immobilized e n z y m e a c t i v i t y / f r e e e n z y m e a c t i v i t y × 100 %"
5,Model construction and molecular dynamics simulation,"2.4 Model construction and molecular dynamics simulation The SiO2 crystal structure was first cut into a (001) surface after which it was hydro-treated, and the crystal structure of the recombinant GTL2 based on the protein data bank (2 W22) was hydrogenated and optimized under AMBER14 force field conditions. Specifically, the MD simulation was realized as follows: first, Gromacs 2018.4 software was used to perform MD simulation under constant temperature and pressure as well as periodic boundary conditions [20]. Second, the Charmm36 all-atom force field was applied to the whole molecule and a TIP3P water model was constructed [21] by adding 19,358 water molecules. After the addition of the water molecules, there was an increase in the total number of atoms in the system to 72147. All the hydrogen bonds involved were constrained using the LINCS algorithm [22], and the integration step time was 1 fs. Third, electrostatic interactions were determined using the Particle-mesh Ewald method [23], and the cutoff value for non-bonding interactions, which was updated at 10 steps intervals, was set to 10 Å. Finally, the V-rescale temperature coupling method was used to control the simulated temperature at 300 K [24], and the Parrinello-Rahman method was used to control the pressure below 1 bar [25]. In brief, the steepest descent method was used to minimize the energy difference between the two systems so as to eliminate the close between the atoms. Thereafter, NVT equilibrium simulation corresponding to 100 ps was performed at 300 K; and finally, the system performed a 50-ns MD simulation. The conformation was registered every 10 ps, and the visualization of the simulation results was completed using the integrated Gromacs program as well as the VMD."
6,Stability analysis of bionic-immobilized lipase,"2.5 Stability analysis of bionic-immobilized lipase To investigate the effects of the temperature stability, both immobilized lipase and free lipase were incubated at different temperatures within the range 40–80 °C for 3 h at pH 8.0, after which enzyme activity analysis was conducted. To explore the effects of organic solvents on lipase activity, various organic solvents (1%), including methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, glycerol, n-butanol, and n-hexane, were used to incubate the enzymes at pH 8.0 and 50 °C for 3 h. To evaluate the storage stability, both immobilized lipase and free lipase were stored in Tris-HCl buffers (pH = 8.0) at 4 °C, and samples were taken at 2-day intervals to analyze enzyme activity."
7,Evaluation of the biodiesel producing performance and reusability of bionic-immobilized lipase,"2.6 Evaluation of the biodiesel producing performance and reusability of bionic-immobilized lipase The bionic-immobilized lipase was used to catalyze the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) via transesterification of rapeseed oil with methanol. To maximize the FAMEs yield, the effects of temperature (30–55 °C), catalysts amount (w/w, 1%–30%), water content (w/w, 0%–100%), n-hexane content (w/w, 1%–10%), the methanol-oils molar ratio (1:1–6:1), and reaction time (0–72 h) on the FAMEs yield were investigated. Rapeseed oil (1 g), methanol (200 µL), bionic-immobilized lipase (20%), deionized water (5%), and n-hexane (1%) were added into a 10-mL sterile centrifuge tube, which was then shaken at 45 °C and 200 rpm for 72 h. The yield of FAMEs was calculated according to Eq. 3. Furthermore, to evaluate the reusability of the bionic-immobilized lipase, the immobilized enzymes were collected via centrifugation and washed three times using Tris-HCl buffer and used seven times, each time in a new reaction system. During the first FAMEs preparation cycle, the catalytic activity of the immobilized lipase was set as 100%. (3) FAMEs Yield (%) = (M Generated FAMEs / M Reaction mixture) × 100% Herein, M represents the mass weight."
8,Analysis methods,"2.7 Analysis methods Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China). The OD410, OD562, and OD600 were analyzed using an Eon Microplate Reader (Gene Company Limited, Chai Wan, Hong Kong). After drying under vacuum at 37 °C, the resulting bionic-immobilized and free recombinant GTL2 as well as SiO2 crystals were subjected to morphological characterization via scanning electron microscope (SEM; S4800, Hitachi, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan), structural characterization via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; Vertex70, Bruker, Germany), and specific surface area and pore size determination via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET, IQ-2, American Kangta Instruments Co., Ltd, US) analysis and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm plotting [11,26]. FAMEs content was determined quantitatively using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2010) with a DB-WAX (30 mm × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) capillary column and methyl heptadecanoate served as the internal standard. The GC detection conditions are as follows: detector temperature 300 °C, injection port temperature 250 °C, split injection with a ratio of 30:1, carrier gas argon, and constant velocity 40 cm/s."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Bionic-immobilization of recombinant lipase,"3.1 Bionic-immobilization of recombinant lipase Presently, there is great interest in the use of enzymatic catalysis in biodiesel production, and it has been demonstrated that immobilized lipase can play an important role in enzymatic processes owing to its stability as well as reusability. Therefore, in this study, recombinant GTL2 was produced through scale-up fermentation, and a total of 240 mg purified recombinant protein was obtained and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1). Thereafter, bionic-immobilization of the recombinant GTL2 containing the polyhistidine tag with TMOS was performed. When phosphate ions were present, long-chain polyamines like protein could induce the aggregation of silicic acid precursors resulting in the formation of silica particles [26]. Specifically, polycationic catalysts (HCl) and silicic acid precursors (TMOS) could under a one-step to form silica, and the recombinant GTL2 added in this process could be captured on the silica carrier to obtain the bionic-immobilized lipase. Therefore, the effects of the HCl amount, TMOS amount, PBS buffer concentration, and enzyme amount were investigated to obtain the optimal immobilizing conditions (Table S1). The immobilization efficiency and activity recovery of the bionic-immobilized lipase improved with increasing HCl, TMOS, enzyme amount, and PBS ions concentrations. Among these factors, phosphate concentration showed the greatest impact on immobilization efficiency during the immobilization process. According to a previous report on silica [27], the amount of silica particles precipitated increases as the concentration of phosphate increases until saturation occurs. This indicates that the divalent anion has a more significant impact on the polymerization process of silicic acid [28], and the experimental results further confirmed this observation. However, there was an inflection point in the growth curve corresponding to the activity recovery of the immobilized lipase. When all the relevant parameters increased further, the enzyme activity of the immobilized lipase began to decrease. This might be due to the excessive aggregation of the silica particles during the immobilization process, which prevented the establishment of a relationship between the substrate and lipase. Finally, under the optimal bionic-immobilization conditions (0.5 mM HCl, 1.0 M TMOS, 150 mM PBS dissolved recombinant GTL2, and a protein concentration of 6 mg/mL), the maximum immobilization efficiency (97.71%) as well the highest enzyme activity recovery (89.62%) was obtained. These values are higher than those reported in a previous study (immobilization efficiency and activity recovery of 96.8% and 81.5%, respectively) [26] probably because the recombinant GTL2 was purified to avoid the effects of other miscellaneous proteins on the bionic-immobilization process. In brief, the formation of the biologically induced silica, which is a green method of immobilization, was characterized by mild reaction conditions, and showed strong controllability."
11,Characterization of bionic-immobilized lipase structure,"3.2 Characterization of bionic-immobilized lipase structure By analyzing the surface profiles of the silica particles, puified lipase, and the immobilized lipase (Figs. 1 and 2 ), it was clear that the recombinant GTL2 had a regular crystal structure, while the silica particles presented an irregular lamellar structure with porous sites. The complex of lipase-silica particles had no fixed surface morphology, their morphology was different from the tight mesh and spherical shape given that an inducer was used to promote the aggregation of silicic acid [29]. However, it was also observed that the recombinant GTL2 was loaded on the surface of the silica particles. These results also indicated that the silica structure was suitable for protein loading, and its structural flexibility and rigidity could be shaped and adjusted according to the 3-D distribution of recombinant lipase during the immobilization process, as the fact that the recombinant lipase would form different degrees of crystallinity in various microenvironments. The compostite structure of the lipase-silica particles also demonstrated that the recombinant GTL2 was successfully loaded onto the silica particles. Structural characteristic peaks corresponding to silica particles, free lipase, and immobilized lipase were obtained using FTIR. From Fig. 3 , it was evident that characteristic peaks corresponding to the protein structure were observed in the 1500–1750 cm−1 region, ν [amide I] (1650 cm−1), and ν [amide II] (1550 cm−1) [30,31], which were absent in FTIR spectrum corresponding to bare carrier silica in this region. Silica paticles were detected wth characteristic peaks in the 1080, 965 and 800 cm−1 regions, which are the groups and vibration forms corresponding to the stretching, bending, and flexural vibrations of Si-O-Si, Si-OH, and Si-O-Si, respctively [32–34]. In addition, characteristic peaks corresponding to silica and protein appeared in the same position on the FTIR spectrum of the immobilized lipase, indicating that the recombinant GTL2 was successfully bound to the silica particles. In effect, FTIR spectroscopy also confirmed that the connection of the recombinant GTL2 with the silica network. Both silica and the immobilized lipase were subjected to BET analysis, and as shown in Fig. 4 , the adsorption isotherms obtained could be classified as typical type IV isotherms. Initially, the curve corresponding to the low P/P0 area showed an upward convex upward. Subsequently, the adsorption increased significantly. Additionally, the adsorbate underwent capillary condensation, and the isotherm rose rapidly. When all the pores coalesced, adsorption only occurred on the outer surface, which was much smaller than the inner surface; thus, the curve became flat and a plateau could be observed [35]. Type IV isotherms are characteristic of mesoporous solids, which are formed when porous adsorbents undergo multilayer adsorption [36]. Therefore, the characteristics of the bionic-immobilzed lipase were consistent with the IV isotherm, suggested that the immobilized lipase formed had a typical mesoporous structure. Furthermore, the pore size distributions of the silica particles and the immobilized lipase were also determined using the BJH method. It was observed that the immobilized lipase had an average pore size diamater of 3.854 nm, which was found to be slightly larger than that of the silica particles (3.439 nm). Thus, the recombinant GTL2 might probably bind to the outer surface of the silica in some way."
12,Molecular dynamics simulation of bionic-immobilization mechanism,"3.3 Molecular dynamics simulation of bionic-immobilization mechanism 3.3.1 Simulation system analysis and its recombinant lipase structure To further explore the mechanism of the interaction between the silica particles and the recombinant GTL2, MD simulation of the bionic-immobilization process was carried out. First, MD simulation stability analysis was performed. Reportedly, potential energy changes are an important basis for judging whether an entire system is stable [37]. Fig. S2 shows the changes in the potential energy of the system over time during the MD simulation process. Form this figure, it was evident that there was no obvious fluctuation in the potential energy of the system. The average value was −3.279 ± 0.001 × 106 kJ/mol, and the fluctuation range value was only 0.04 %, indicating that the MD simulation process was stable and reliable. Second, MD convergence parameter analysis was conducted. The dynamic behavior of the system in the water environment could be approximated based on the root mean square deviation (RMSD), which can describe the degree of the difference between the conformation of the system at a certain moment and the target conformation, and is an important index to judge whether the simulation system converges [38]. The variation of the RMSD of the Cα atom of the recombinant lipase with time is shown in Fig. S3(a), which indicated that the RMSD of the protein gradually stabilized after 30 ns, showing an average value of 0.173 ± 0.011 nm. The radius of gyration (Rg) can indicate the degree of expansion of the system during the MD simulation, and is one of the important factors that can be used to judge the stability of the system. Fig. S3(b) shows the Rg value of lipase during the immobilization process. From this figure, it was that the protein system showed no obvious expansion or contraction changes during the MD simulation process, and was in a relatively stable state with an average Rg value of 2.150 ± 0.006 nm. Generally, the lipase was stabilized during the simulation process, and the trajectory obtained based on the MD simulation could be used for subsequent analysis. In addition, the lipase was subjected to structural analysis. The root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of biomolecules, which represents their flexibility, was determined. Generally, the greater the RMSF value, the greater the flexibility of the corresponding residues [39]. The distribution of the flexibility of the amino acid residues in recombinant GTL2 is shown in Fig. S4(a), which shows that the main flexible regions were located at the N- and C-terminals of the lipase, Met174-Phe182, Gln217, and Glu227. This is because the N- and C-terminals regions are stretched on the surface of the recombinant GTL2 and have weak interactions with the surrounding amino acids. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S4(b), the two regions of Met174-Phe182 and Gln217-Glu227 were located on the surface of the protein molecules, and were strongly affected by the surrounding solvent molecules, thus, the motion amplitude was relatively larger. In addition, it was also observed that the content of the secondary structure of the recombinant GTL2 did not change significantly during MD simulation in Fig. S4(c) [40]. Among its components, helix showed the highest composition (approximately 37.54%), while the contents of coil, turn, and sheet were 25.82, 21.68, and 14.96%, respectively. 3.3.2 Mechanism of interaction between recombinant lipase and silica particles The interaction between recombinant lipase and silica particles was explored, and Fig. S5 depicts the binding as well as the density distribution of the recombinant GTL2 on the SiO2 surface after 50 ns of the MD simulation. Specifically, as shown in Fig. S5(a), part of the recombinant GTL2 was bound to the outer surface of SiO2, which was also confirmed by the density distribution shown in Fig. S5(b). However, the SiO2 surface was modified with large number of hydroxyl groups that could bind to recombinant GTL2 through hydrogen bonds. Therefore, to further reveal this interaction, the number of hydrogen bonds between the lipase and SiO2 as well as the associated binding energy was evaluated. From Fig. 5 (a), it is evident that the number of hydrogen bonds between lipase and SiO2 increased from 0 to 4 at the beginning, indicating that lipase gradually combined with the SiO2 surface forming a stable hydrogen bond interaction. Considering the change in binding energy shown in Fig. 5(b), it can be seen that the binding energy corresponding to the interaction between lipase and SiO2 in the initial structure was zero. As the simulation progressed, the electrostatic energy and L-J potential energy corresponding to the interaction between the two decreased, indicating that the lipase interacted with SiO2, resulting in the formation of a stable complex characterized by a lower energy. Specifically, both the electrostatic interaction as well as the L-J interaction had a similar contribution (approximately 200 kJ/mol) to the relationship between lipase and the SiO2 surface. To clarify the key amino acid residues that are necessary for binding, an in-depth analysis of the mode by which the recombinant GTL2 became bound to the SiO2 surface was performed. As shown in Fig. 6 , after the lipase was bound to the SiO2 surface, the catalytic activity center faced upwards, without any restriction caused by SiO2; thus, this center could better perform its catalytic function. Specifically, Arg336, Lys345, His391, His392, His394, and His395 were identified as the key amino acid residues that are necessary for the binding of recombinant GTL2 to SiO2. Among them, Arg336, His392, and His394 formed hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the SiO2 surface, further indicating that the histidine tag at the C-terminus of the recombinant GTL2 played an important role in the recognition process. Bionic-immobilization enhance the tolerance and reusability of the recombinant lipase. However, if the interaction between lipase and SiO2 causes a significant change in the protein center, the lipase would not maintain its natural active structure and would lose its catalytic activity. Thus, the structural changes in the amino acid residues close to the catalytic center of lipase before and after bionic-immobilization were evaluated. It was observed that the catalytic center of GTL2 was mainly composed of the catalytic triad, Ser114-His359-Asp318 [41]. Among these, Ser114 possibly played a key role in catalysis, while His359 and Asp318 played a role in proton transfer. As shown in Fig. 7 , the key amino acid structure of the catalytic center did not under any significant transformation, indicating that bionic-immobilization did not lead to a loss of the catalytic activity of GTL2. Further, the conformations of the two amino acids, Phe291 and Ile320 close to the active center were altered, and their side chains showed a certain degree of deflection compared with the observations made before bionic-immobilization. Specifically, Ile320, close to the catalytic triad, possibly played a hydrophobic role in enhancing binding to the substrate. On the other hand, the benzene ring side-chain of Phe291, which was located at the entrance above the catalytic center and faced inwards, turned outward after immobilization. This benzene ring did not only have a strong hydrophobic effect, but also a larger volume that could restrict access to the substrates. After the recombinant GTL2 was immobilized on the SiO2 surface, the benzene ring side-chain of Phe291 faced outward and widened the entrance, eliminating the restricted access to the substrate and improving catalytic efficiency."
13,"Stability analysis of temperature, organic solvents, and storage","3.4 Stability analysis of temperature, organic solvents, and storage The activity stability of the immobilized lipase is an important indicator of the efficiency of the bionic-immobilization process. Specifically, the free and bionic-immobilized lipase were incubated under various temperatures, organic solvents, and storage conditions, and thereafter their stability was evaluated by performing lipase activity analysis. Further, to ensure that the loss of enzyme activity during stability analysis was not caused by the leakage of the recombinant lipase from the carrier, the free protein content of the solution was tested before the determination of the bionic-immobilized lipase activity. The immobilized lipase and free lipase generally exhibited good tolerance towards temperature changes, and the optimal temperature was 60 °C for immobilized lipase, correspondingly 50 °C for free lipase (Fig. 8 (a)). The immobilized lipase retained more than 88.65% of relative activity at temperatures between 40 and 65 °C, and this was higher than that of free lipase. The optimal temperature of the immobilized lipase was 60 °C, which was higher than that corresponding to the free lipase. From this observation, it can be concluded that the immobilized lipase had superior thermal stability, and the bionic-immobilization process is an effective method for enhancing the stability of GTL2. However, when the temperature exceeded 70 °C, the enzyme activities of the immobilized and free lipase decreased greatly. The immobilized lipase showed good tolerance to short-chain alcohols, including methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and glycerol, and its relative activity was maintained at over 89.34% (Fig. 8(b)). Its tolerance to n-hexane was maximum, corresponding to the highest relative activity (109.99%). Compared with free lipase, the stability of the bionic-immobilized lipase in methanol and glycerol increased significantly, and this had great benefits for the subsequent preparation of FAMEs. After storage stability analysis (Fig. 8(c)), it was observed that the free lipase lost 38.26% of its relative activity, while the immobilized lipase lost 21.86% of its relative activity, which was 16.40% less than that of free lipase. Furthermore, the immobilized lipase maintained 91.10% relative activity during the first 6 days stored at 4 °C, and 78.14% of relative activity remained after 14 days of storage. Generally, after bionic-immobilization of the recombinant GTL2, there was a significant improvement in its thermal stability, storage stability, and organic solvents tolerance. Additionally, it showed better stability compared with the free lipase possibly the carrier silica particles provided a more suitable microenvironment for lipase molecules, and the steric hindrance established owing to the binding of lipase to the silica surface could prevent the protein from being denatured and inactivated by aggregation and precipitation."
14,Catalytic preparation of biodiesel using bionic-immobilized lipase,"3.5 Catalytic preparation of biodiesel using bionic-immobilized lipase Using rapeseed oil as raw material, the bionic-immobilized lipase was used to catalyze the transesterification of FAMEs using methanol. To optimize biodiesel production, the effects of temperatures (30–55 °C), catalyst amount (oil weight, 1%–30%), water content (oil weight, 0–100%), n-hexane content (oil weight, 1%–10%), methanol-oil molar ratio (1:1–6:1), and reaction time (0–72 h) on FAMEs yield were explored, respectively. As shown in Fig. S6(a), temperature played a key role in the enzymatic process. As the temperature increased from 30 to 45 °C, there was an increase in the rate of transesterification. Thus, FAMEs yield also increased and remained above 80.91%. When the reaction temperature exceeded 45 °C, the yield decreased gradually. This observation could be attributed to the easy denaturation and inactivation of protein owing to the increase in temperature. Thus, 45 °C was identified as the optimal temperature, and such a suitable reaction temperature could not only enhance the reaction rate, but also help to extend the service life of the immobilized lipase, thereby enabling the reaction to proceed in a positive direction. The dosage of the immobilized lipase had a significant effect on the transesterification reaction, and as shown in Fig. S6(b), as the amount of immobilized lipase increased, FAMEs yield also improved rapidly. Further, when the immobilized lipase dosage exceeded 10%, the increasing trend of the FAMEs yield gradually stabilized. This might be due to the fact that when the enzyme dosage was very high, a large number of the immobilzed lipase tended to accumulate and encapsulate the active center, reducing the polarity between lipase and the substrates [42]. This affected the catalytic efficiency, hindering the production of FAMEs [43].Considering the cost of purified lipase and the reusability in the catalytic process of immobilized lipase, while ensuring that FAMEs yield was not affected, in this study, the most appropriate immobilized lipase dose was determinded to be 20%. As shown in Fig. S6(c), when the n-hexane content was 1%, the maximum FAMEs yield was 89.13%, and as the n-hexane content increased, there was a decrease in the FAMEs yield. This is because when an appropriate amount of n-hexane was presented in the reaction system, the mutual solubility of methanol and rapeseed oil could be increased, while the toxic effect of high local methanol concentrations on the immobilized lipase could be effectively reduced. However, to a certain extent, an excessive n-hexane content promotes the enrichment of the by-product, glycerol, and increased its toxicity to lipase, even causing the aggregation of the immobilized lipase, limiting its catalytic efficiency [44]. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S6(d), when there was no water in the reaction system, the rate of the transesterification reaction was low. When the water content was in the range 0–5%, FAMEs yield enhanced rapidly, with a water content of 5% resulting in the highest yield (91.19%). Subsequently, as the water content increased, FAMEs production showed a downward trend. Usually, in an enzyme-catalyzed transesterification reaction, in the absence of water, the charged groups and polar groups of lipase molecules would interact to produce an inactive closed structure. On the other hand, when water is present, it could act as a lubricant, making lipase molecules more flexible, and this is beneficial as it improved enzyme activity. However, excessive water would arouse the hydrolysis reaction, thereby reducing FAMEs yield. Therefore, the optimal water content of the present reaction system was 5%. The FAMEs yield continued to increase as the methanol-oil molar ratio increased between 1:1 and 5:1, as shown in Fig. S6(e), and when the methanol-oil molar ratio was 5:1, the highest FAMEs yield (96.59%) was observed. Subsequently, when the methanol-oil molar ratio exceeded 5:1, the FAMEs yield decreased gradually. The methanolysis process is a reversible reaction. First, an increase in the methanol ratio would favor the positive direction of the reaction, as evidenced by the enhanced FAMEs yield. However, an excessive methanol ratio did not only poison lipase and affect catalysis, but also increase the subsequent separation and recovery costs. The variation of FAMEs yield with reaction time is shown in Fig. S6(f), within 0–12 h, the FAMEs yield increased rapidly as the reaction progressed. After 12 h, the enzymatic process became stabilized, and FAMEs yield increased slowly, and basically, was maintained above 91.04%. This observation could be attribute to the transesterification process that was catalyzed by the immobilized lipase, which is essentially a reversible reaction. Further, when the amounts of the reactants were higher than that of the products, the reaction proceeded in a positive direction. Therefore, when the reaction time was 60 h, the highest yield of FAMEs was 98.02%, then the FAMEs yield decreased. Furthermore, considering the time cost and energy consumption, the optimal reaction time for FAMEs production was selected as 12 h."
15,Evaluation of bionic-immobilized recombinant lipase reusability,"3.6 Evaluation of bionic-immobilized recombinant lipase reusability The reusability of the immobilized lipase is an important index for measuring the effects of bionic immobilization. If the immobilized lipase could show a high activity after being recycled several times, it implied that the bionic-immobilized lipase was more stable. Thus, in this study, the reusability of the bionic immobilized lipase as a catalyst for biodiesel production was investigated. At the end of each reaction, the immobilized lipase was thoroughly washed to remove residual substrates and products, and used in a new reaction system. Thus, the catalytic activity in the first reaction was defined as 100%, and from Fig. 9 , it was evident that after the four times of repeatedly using the bionic-immobilized lipase, the catalytic activity was not completely lost, but was still maintained above 80.74%. After the immobilized lipase was repeatedly used seven times, its relative activity was maintained above 55.02%. In the process of its repeated utilization, bionic-immobilized lipase must be washed frequently after each reaction. This would cause the protein to fall off the carrier if the silica was broken, resulting in a decrease in the catalytic activity of the bionic-immobilized lipase [45,46]. Furthermore, as shown in Table 1 , comparing biodiesel production based on the utilization of the bionic-immobilized lipase with those reported in other studies, it was evident that the operation of the bionic-immobilization was simple and green, and as an efficient and rapid immobilization method, did not require expensive carriers and had little effects on the loss of enzyme activity. These results indicate that the bionic-immobilized lipase exhibits excellent catalytic activity with respect to biodiesel from rapeseed oil, suggesting that it is a potential biocatalyst for biodiesel preparation. However, given that the bionic-immobilization mainly relied on physical adsorption, the enzyme loaded on the silica particles was easily desorbed, resulting in a decline in catalytic activity. Overall, bionic-immobilization offers the possibility to successfully realize recombinant lipase immobilization, and that bionic-immobilized lipase has great potential for application in biodiesel production."
16,Conclusions,"In this study the preparation of a catalyst (bionic-immobilized GTL2) for the green and simple catalytic preparation of biodiesel was successfully achieved, and the mechanism of the bionic-immobilization process was also explored using MD simulation. After bionic-immobilization, the immobilization efficiency of the immobilized lipase was 97.71% with an activity recovery of 89.62%. Additionally, MD simulation revealed that hydrogen bonds had a special effect on intermolecular recognition, and the active center of the immobilized lipase favored substrate entry. Furthermore, the bionic-immobilized lipase exhibited excellent thermal and storage stability. When it was used as a catalyst for biodiesel production, the FAMEs yield reached 91.04% at 45 °C within 12 h, and its catalytic activity was still as high as 55.02% following seven cycles of reutilization. Therefore, given its uniqueness, bionic-immobilization showed reference significance for the subsequent enzymatic application of expressed recombinant proteins."
