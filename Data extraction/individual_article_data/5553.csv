0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an ideal alternative fuel because of its clean, sustainable and renewable characteristics. Hydrogen has the energy yield of 122 kJ/g that is 2.75 times higher than hydrocarbon fuels and could be directly used to produce electricity through fuel cells [1,2]. The hydrogen gas could be generated by thermochemical, electrochemical or biological processes. The process of biological hydrogen production proceeded at normal pressure and temperature so that considered a less energy-intensive technology than the other two processes. Biological hydrogen production processes mainly relied on photosynthetic or fermentative organisms, and fermentative hydrogen production provided prospects of sustainable energy source as well as the degradation of organic pollutants [3–5]. In Taiwan, the kitchen waste has been collected and classified by the collecting systems of the local environmental protection administrations since 2003, and the amount of it is increasing. According to the statistic data, the amount of kitchen waste collected in Taiwan amounted to 1900 tons per day, and the recycling percentage was about 33.5%. The government in Taiwan also announced that the recycling percentage will increase to 75% in 2020. As the promotion of the policy, the kitchen waste has become the largest amount and nutritive waste. Kitchen waste in Taiwan was reused for pig house feeding (75%) and composting (22%), but both of these two ways to treat the kitchen waste would cause some problems, such as infectious disease or secondary pollution. Anaerobic fermentation is one of the most environmentally friendly methods to treat kitchen waste. In the other hand, Taiwan was short of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas etc.), and more than 98% of energy source was imported from other countries. Thus anaerobic fermentation would be the better method to treat the kitchen waste for both environment and energy consideration. Some of the special bioreactor designs were applied in kitchen waste fermentation for a higher efficiency. For example, Han and Shin [6] developed a leaching-bed bioreactor for hydrogenation, and the maximum hydrogen production rate was 138.5 mmol/L-day. Shin and Yuon [7] developed a thermophilic hydrogen fermentor and the hydrogen producing rate of 39.5 mmol/L-day has been reported. Liu et al. [8] developed a two-stage process combining hydrogen and methane production, and the methane was re-sparging back to the hydrogen fermentor. The hydrogen production rate was increased to138 mmol/L-day via the methane sparging devices. Li et al. [9] also developed a hydrogen fermentor with fill-and-draw operation defined as intermittent-continuous stirred tank reactor (I-CSTR). The highest average hydrogen yield and specific hydrogen production rate was observed with 96.4 ± 37.9 mL H2/g VSSin and 0.11 ± 0.03 L H2/g VSS-day, respectively. The anaerobic fluidized bed is appropriate to treat the specific characteristics of high concentration of soluble organic wastewater and relatively low strength of organic solid. The organic solid could be aggregated to be granule of bioparticle attached with dense biofilm that diverse microbial species were developed with the hydrolytic acidifier and hydrogen producing bacteria. With long-term operation of the anaerobic fluidized bed, two types of microorganisms could be distinguished by their life surroundings in the microbial community: one is suspended growth, the other is attached growth. There are some assumptions in these two growths: the suspended growth would utilize soluble substrates to generate hydrogen gas with shorter HRT and high dilution rate, but the attached microbe would adsorb organic solids to be hydrolyzed and acidified along with H2 production with longer solid retention time and low dilution rate. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the biohydrogen potential and microbial characteristics of the two microbial growths in the anaerobic fluidized bed. A series of biodegradation batch experiments were conducted as the biochemical hydrogen potential test. We also performed a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and scanning electron microscope observation for the diverse microbial identification."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculums and substrates,"2.1 Inoculums and substrates An anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (110 L AnFBR) which kitchen waste (KW) was fed as the major substrate and different weight fractions of napiergrass dregs were fed as the supplemental substrate for bio-hydrogenation at long hydraulic retention time of 7.3 days was established. The temperature control was adjusted at 55 °C and pH = 6.0 with the internal recirculation and the superficial velocity of 2.5 cm/s maintained fluidization of the biofilm carrier and the mixed liquid. Its performance of biohydrogen production attained 1.72 ± 0.28 L-H2/L-day. The sludge was taken from the reactive region of the 110 L AnFBR. A centrifuge (Hitachi Himac CR21G) to divide the sludge into the attached growth and the suspended growth was used. First, the centrifuge was operated at a speed of 5000 rpm, 10 min and the sediments was collected as the attached inoculums, then the supernatant was separated again at a speed of 11,000 rpm, 10 min and gathered the pellets of the centrifuge tubes as the suspended inoculums. The volatile suspended solid (VSS) concentrations of the attached growth and the suspended growth in the batch reactors were 7000 and 14,000 mg/L. The kitchen waste (KW) picked up from the food waste collecting plant in Tainan City, Taiwan was the substrate. The raw KW was further homogenized by a blender, and was separated into soluble and solid substrate at a speed of 11,000 rpm, 10 min by centrifugation. We stored the soluble and solid KW at 4 °C without sterilization."
3,Biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) test,"2.2 Biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) test The BHP test employed in this study was modified from the biochemical methane potential (BMP) test developed by Owen et al. [10]. The batch reactors with a working volume of 1.0 L were kept in a water bath at 55 °C and were fitted with magnetic stirrer at a speed of 600 rpm pH conditions were maintained at 6.0 in each batch reactor by using a pH controller (SUNTEX- pH controller PC-310) connected to a peristaltic pump (MASTERFLEX- model 7518-00) using 2.5 N NaOH. The AnFBR effluent was separated with centrifuge at 11,000 rpm and collected the centrifugal solution as the growth nutrients. The batch reactors were purged with N2 gas prior to the BHP test to create an anaerobic condition. Four reactors were employed in this study. The attached growth and the solid KW were added to a batch reactor labeled as A+; the suspended growth and the soluble KW were added to another reactor labeled as S+. Control experiments only added attached growth and suspended growth were labeled as A and S, respectively. In our assumptions, the suspended growth should utilize the soluble substrates to produce hydrogen gas while the attached growth would hydrolyze the solid substrates first and then produce hydrogen gas. Therefore, solid kitchen waste was as the attached growth substrate to examine the potential of hydrolysis and hydrogen production. The soluble kitchen waste was as the suspended growth substrate to evaluate the potential of hydrogen production. The batch experiments of the attached growth were adjusted at the solid kitchen waste concentration of 175 g-COD/L and the inoculums concentration of 7 g-VSS/L. In the reactor of the suspended growth, the soluble kitchen waste concentration of 132 g-COD/L and the inoculums concentration of 14 g-VSS/L were added. The initial food and microorganism ratio of the attached growth and the suspended growth were 25 and 9.4 g-COD/g-VSS, respectively."
4,Characterization of substrates and metabolites,"2.3 Characterization of substrates and metabolites The composition of biogases in the headspace was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (China GC 8900, Taipei, Taiwan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2 m stainless-steel column packed with Hayesep Q (60/80 mesh) was used for separation of chemical species. The operational temperatures of injection port, oven, and detector were all set at 60 °C. N2 was the carrier gas, and a constant flow rate of 15 mL/min was maintained. Intermediate compounds were quantified by ion chromatography (Dionex DX-120, California, USA) equipped with an anion IonPac ICE-ASI column, an AMMA-ICE II suppressor and a conductivity detector. 1 mmol heptafluorobutylic acid was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min 5 mmol tetrabutylammonium hydroxide was used as the regenerant. The carbohydrate was analyzed using the phenol-sulfuric acid method [11]. The pH, NH4 +-N, chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS), and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to Standard Methods [12]."
5,DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR),"2.4 DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) A modification of the SDS-based extraction method was used to obtain the genomic DNA from the batch test samples, as described elsewhere [13]. The extracted DNA was stored at −20 °C for later use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR was performed on the extracted DNA in order to amplify the 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) genes. The forward primer BN of EUB 338 (5′-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3′) with a 6-carboxy-fluoresceine (6FAM) label and the reverse primer of 1392r (5′-ACGGGCGGTGTGTAC-3′) with a HEX label were used for PCR reactions [14]. The PCR mixture contained 1x PCR buffer, 0.2 mM of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (2.5 mM each), 0.2 μM each of forward and reverse primers, 0.5 μL of the DNA template and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Otsu, Japan) in a final volume of 20 μL. Amplification was performed using an automated thermal cycler (RoboCycler, Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). PCR reactions were performed as follows: 30 cycles of denaturation (1 min at 94 °C), annealing (1 min at 55 °C), and extension (1.5 min at 72 °C), followed by a final extension of 10 min. The products were checked by applying to a 2% agarose gel."
6,Enzymatic digestion and electrophoresis of PCR products,"2.5 Enzymatic digestion and electrophoresis of PCR products The purified fluorescently labeled PCR products were digested with the restriction enzyme of MseI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for 3 h at 37 °C [14]. The fluorescently labeled terminal restriction-fragments (T-RFs) obtained after digestion were analyzed for gel electrophoresis in the Nucleic Acid Analysis and Synthesis Core Laboratory of the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan, to determine the sizes of fragments obtained from each sample. The lengths of the terminal fragments were obtained by electrophoresis with an ABI Prism 377 automated sequencer (Perkin–Elmer Corp., Wellesley, MA)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,The biogas production,"3.1 The biogas production Fig. 1 presents the H2 yield results over the course of the batch experiments. Both of A+ and S+ had significant hydrogen gas production, but they had huge difference in cumulative H2 yield curve. At S+, the lag period was short and the gas production rate fast increased until the maximum hydrogen yield production rate occurred (7.58 mL/g-COD/hr) at 5 h. It still maintained high gas production rate in a period of time (10 h) and then gradually moderated after 20 h. Finally it produced 67 mL/g-COD H2 yield after 160 h biodegradation time. At A+, it had longer lag period than S+, and the maximum H2 yield production rate was 1.14 mL/g-COD/hr at 55 h. After 60 h, its rate decreased rapidly and it produced totally 35 mL/g-COD H2 yield finally. At control experiments, H2 production was undetected. As shown in Table 1 , the hydrogen yields were 1.31 and 2.5 mmol-H2/g-COD at the attached growth and the suspended growth, respectively. The maximum specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) at A+ was 1.06 mmol-H2/h/g-VSS; the SHPR at S+ was 2.65 mmol-H2/h/g-VSS. The lag phase regressed from the modified Gompertz equation was shown that the attached growth had longer lag phase at 20 h than the suspended growth at 3.6 h. Measured hydrogen concentrations were about 47% and 45% at A+ and S+, respectively. No methane production was observed after the batch reaction."
9,Intermediate products and characteristic analyses,"3.2 Intermediate products and characteristic analyses Table 2 displays the characteristic analyses at initial, middle, and final condition of A+ and S+. The sampling time of middle condition was according to the period of large amount of hydrogen gas production. At A+, MLSS and MLVSS removal rate were 27% and 43%, and the MLVSS and MLSS ratio were decreased at initial, middle, and final condition of 0.88, 0.69, and 0.69, respectively. This represents the attached growth had the ability of hydrolyzing the solid kitchen waste after the 160 h biodegradation time. The total carbohydrate at A+ at initial condition was 38 g/L, and the soluble carbohydrate was 11 g/L. About 2/3 proportion of carbohydrate was solid state. The final total carbohydrate removal rate was 68%, and about 15 g/L solid carbohydrate was biodegraded. The solid digestion was mainly contributed by solid carbohydrate degradation. The increase of soluble organic nitrogen was observed at A+, which indicated the solid protein was hydrolyzed. The major intermediate products at A+ were butyrate and acetate, and the lactate was consumed 2000 mg/L at final condition. The concentration of propionate and ethanol did not increase between initial and final condition at A+. At S+, the total carbohydrate at initial condition was 54 g/L, and the soluble carbohydrate was 43 g/L. The total carbohydrate and soluble carbohydrate removal rate were 88% and 91%. In the final condition, the soluble organic nitrogen was decreased from 2.1 to 1.6 g/L and was converted to NH4 +-N. The final analysis of NH4 +-N was increased about 500 mg/L at S+. In the analysis of intermediate products, we observed the degradation of lactate (about 45% removal rates), and this phenomenon was also found in the AnFB reactor. Butyrate was the chief intermediate product about 19 g/L in the final condition of S+. At A+ and S+, the COD and total organic carbon ratios were gradually increasing after 160 h biodegradation time, this phenomenon might be explained that the rate of organic carbon converted to CO2 was faster than the rate of organic compounds provided electrons to hydrogen ion to produce hydrogen gas between the biodegrading batch experiments. At S+, huge amount of lactic acid degradation (about 6000 mg/L degradation) displayed a special phenomenon in fermentative hydrogen production. The generation of lactate (or other reduced fermentation end products) was considered that hydrogen has not been liberated as gas phase [15], and the inhibition of hydrogen production bacteria by lactic acid bacteria was investigated [16]. Therefore, the generation of lactic acid in fermentative hydrogen production usually represented the negative signal while operating. The degradation of lactic acid for fermentative hydrogen production was observed in some studies that fed with food waste [6] [9] but exactly how lactate worked in biohydrogen process with kitchen waste was not clear so far. Some of the anaerobes were able to degrade lactate such as Desulfovibrio, Clostridium and Lactobacillus [17–20]. Lactate can work as an electron donor or an electron acceptor while acidification according to [21]: lactate− + 2H2O → acetate− + HCO3 − + H+ + 2H2, ΔGo′ = −4.2 kJ/mol lactate− + H2 → propionate− + H2O, ΔGo′ = −79.9 kJ/mol Some of the lactate degradation was related about hydrogen production such as Clostridium acetobutylicum strain P262 that fed with lactate and acetate as co-substrate would generate butyrate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen as main metabolic byproduct [17]. The further study for the effect upon the biological hydrogen production of lactic acid degradation in anaerobic fermentation with kitchen waste was scheduled. lactate− + 0.4acetate− + 0.7H+ → 0.7butyrate− + 0.6H2 + CO2 + 0.4H2O, ΔGo′ = −183.9 kJ/mol The electron distribution of biochemical hydrogen potential test was calculated by characteristic analysis (Table 2). Mass balance of electron distribution was estimated by COD from empirical formulas of C6H10O5 and C16H24O5N4 for carbohydrate and protein [22]. As the result of electron distribution (Fig. 2 ) in the initial condition of A+, solid COD was the most dominant item of all represented about half of electron including solid carbohydrate 18% while soluble carbohydrate was about 7.5%. Electron distribution of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were about 22.7% which was mainly contributed by butyrate 11%, acetate 4% and lactate 5%. The electron distribution of butyrate and acetate were high in initial condition because we used the effluent of AnFB which contained large amount of butyrate and acetate as the growth nutrients. In the initial condition of S+, its electron distribution was extremely different with A+. The most chief item was soluble carbohydrate about 39% and the second was solid COD about 21%. Electron distribution of VFAs and alcohols were about 19% which mainly contributed by lactate 11%. Soluble protein also contributed 15% electron in the initial condition of S+. The recovery of electron balance estimated from initial characteristics of A+ and S+ achieved 91% and 94%. Carbohydrate was a good source of organic carbon for fermentative hydrogen production and also higher biodegradability [15]. At A+, total carbohydrate was about 25%, but soluble carbohydrate only had 7.5%. Though solid kitchen waste was not a carbohydrate-rich material with less than one-fourth of electron distribution, carbohydrate included starch-like and cellulose-like organic substrate in solid kitchen waste was thought the main organic matter for biohydrogen conversion in this study. At S+, the total carbohydrate was high about 50% and large proportion was soluble, so suspended growth can utilize the carbohydrate fast and completely to produce H2 gas. After 160 h biodegrading time, at A+, the electron distribution of solid COD was decreased from 54% to 40% which revealed the solid substrate was hydrolyzed by the attached growth. 2% electron was converted to hydrogen gas at A+ while at S+, 4.4% electron was converted. The most portions of electrons were converted from soluble carbohydrate to volatile fatty acids at S+. In the final condition of S+, VFAs was the most dominant item about 44%, mainly contributed by butyrate 29%."
10,Microbial morphology observation,"3.3 Microbial morphology observation Scanning electron microscope was used to observe the microbial morphology of the attached and suspended growths. As Fig. 3 shows, initial state of A and S indicated the original microbial shapes of the attached and suspended growth. The original shapes of the attached and suspended growth mainly were short rods about 2–3 μm long. The attached rods produced some extracellular polymeric substances to adhere to solid and cellulosic substrates (Fig. 3 (1)). We also can observe some coccus about 1 μm in diameter at suspended growth (Fig. 3 (2)). At the initial state of A+, the large solid substrate was found and had not been biodegraded. There were also little microbes that adhered to the substrates. After 160 h, the attached rods secreted extracellular polymeric substances to attach solid substrates and biodegrade them. At the initial state of S+, diverse microbial shapes were observed because kitchen waste included large amount of microbes. There were long rods (more than 10 μm long), short rods (2–3 μm long) and chubby rods (about 10 μm long and 3 μm wide). After batch test, the microbial shapes were tending simple and mainly were short rods."
11,Bio-community monitoring by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism method,"3.4 Bio-community monitoring by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism method The dynamics of hydrogen producing bacterial communities were detected by the 16S rDNA-based T-RFLP method. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 indicate the electrophoreograms for the mixed liquor samples taken from each batch test. As shown in Fig. 4, initial state of A represented the original microbial communities of the attached growth in the AnFB reactor, and the terminal restriction-fragments (T-RFs) of 256 base pairs (bps) was mainly found. Initial state of A+ had more abundant population than A because of the kitchen waste substrate without sterilization. Kitchen waste was considered as a kind of semi-fermentative waste, thus it contained multiple and diverse microorganisms including some of the hydrolysis bacteria or hydrogen production bacteria. With the hydrogen production increasing, the amount of T-RFs of 256 bps became the dominant group in the A+ system. As shown in Fig. 5, initial state of S represented the microbial communities of the suspended growth in the AnFB reactor, and the terminal restriction-fragments (T-RFs) of 278 base pairs (bps) was mainly found. Like A+, initial state of S+ had also more abundant population than S because of the kitchen waste substrate added. With the hydrogen production increasing, the amount of T-RFs of 256 bps and 228 bps became the dominant groups in the S+ system. In the AnFB, when the lactate was degraded well, the T-RFs of 492 bps would be found. In this study, the lactate also was biodegraded well at S+, and we also observed the T-RFs of 492 bps in the final state of S+. Therefore, the T-RFs of 492 bps might be the lactate degrading microorganisms, but this discussion needs further molecular biology technology like cloning sequencing to investigate. Although the 16S rDNA sequential method is often used to assess the diversity of microbial communities, some bio-monitoring methods such as T-RFLP are much less time consuming than the traditional isolation and cultivation methods. The molecular methods T-RFLP was utilized in this study to investigate the microbial community to provide more information on population dynamics during the operation to render a better control of the fermentation process. According to the database, T-RFs of 256 bps represents some species of Clostridium genus, such as C. stercorarium, C. thermolacticum (cluster III), and Caloramator viterbensis (close relative of Clostridium) in the system [14]. Many Clostridium species were capable of producing acetic acid, butyric acid and hydrogen from carbohydrate fermentation. In addition, several studies surveyed microbial communities of anaerobic hydrogen producing systems, using traditional isolation/identification and/or molecular methods, and demonstrated that Clostridium species were dominant bacterial groups and their presence in correlation with hydrogen production as well. T-RFLP data provide an easy and powerful tool to confirm the bacterial population shift, but more precise data might be needed via a sequential cloning method to identify the exact species in the system."
12,Conclusion,"1. The maximum specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) at A+ was 1.06 mmol-H2/h/g-VSS; the SHPR at S+ was 2.65 mmol-H2/h/g-VSS. The lag phase regressed from the modified Gompertz equation was shown that the attached growth had longer lag phase at 20 h than the suspended growth at 3.6 h. 2. From characteristic analyses, the attached growth had the ability of hydrolyzing the solid kitchen waste (MLVSS/MLSS ratio from 0.88 to 0.69), while suspended growth utilized the soluble substrate fast to produce VFAs and H2 gas (soluble carbohydrate removal rate was 91% and butyrate was the chief intermediate product about 19 g/L) 3. Huge amount of lactic acid degradation (about 6000 mg/L degradation) by the suspended growth displayed a special phenomenon in fermentative hydrogen production. The lactic acid degradation also could produce H2 gas, and it could follow this equation, lactate− + 0.4acetate− + 0.7H+ → 0.7butyrate− + 0.6H2 + CO2 + 0.4H2O 4. From SEM observation, kitchen waste included large amount of microbes and solid substrates, so diverse microbial shapes were observed. After 160 h biodegradation time, the main microbial shapes of attached and suspended growth were short rods about 0.5–1 μm wide by 2–3 μm long. 5. The amount of T-RFs of 256 bps was the dominant group of attached and suspended growth. According to the database, T-RFs of 256 bps represent some species of Clostridium genus."
