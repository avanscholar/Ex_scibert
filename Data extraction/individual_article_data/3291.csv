0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is generally renewable and clean energy sources, so it does not release any toxic gas that could produce a greenhouse effect in the fuel pack. Since 1970, hydrogen is known to be used as a fuel by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) in some space vehicles [1]. The biggest challenge for hydrogen is its storage and transport. Porous materials, hybrid materials, and metal hydrides have been developed to overcome the challenge of storing hydrogen [2,3]. Among those, boron‑nitrogen based materials show intense interest due to their non-toxicity, stability and high density [2–4]. Among boron‑nitrogen based compounds, ammonia-borane (AB), and its derivatives are the most commonly known and used. For the last several decades, some systems that contain different reactions such as hydrolysis, dehydrogenation (dehydrocoupling), and methanolysis of AB and production of hydrogen have been given in literature intensively [5–8]. The focus of research in the class of amine boranes lies mainly on AB due to its low molecular weight (high hydrogen content). The decomposition of AB results in a distinct contamination of the released hydrogen by ammonia and borazine, which is a major problem for application in fuel cells. The decomposition of AB derivatives can circumvent this problem since nitrogen substituted derivatives of borazine as well as substituted amines are substantially less volatile [9]. In this context methylamine-borane (MeAB, CH3NH2-BH3) [10] has been investigated. In the last few decades, MeAB is an ammoniacal boron derivative and has been extensively studied based on hydrolysis reaction due to its high hydrogen capacity (11.1%). In the following reaction (1), the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of methylamine-borane is given. As can be seen from the reaction, when a suitable catalyst is used, 3 mol H2 is released from 1 mol MeAB in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation, and it is thought that the hydrogen obtained by this route is more advantageous than the other systems [11–13]. (1) CH3NH2-BH3 (aq) + 2H2O → (CH3NH3)BO2 (aq) + 3H2 (g) In the catalyst systems developed for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB, carbon-based nanomaterials have been used as a catalyst as shown in Table 1 [13–23]. Until now, the catalytic studies showed that polymeric materials could be applied successfully to stabilize catalysts containing metals. By utilizing the steric structure of the polymeric materials, it facilitates both access to the active sites and the control of the particle size. Among the polymers, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is used effectively in the stability of metal nanocatalyst due to some properties such as non-toxic and non-ionic properties, hydrophilic and hydrophobic structures. Besides, the molecular structure of PVP is given in Scheme 1 . As can be seen in Scheme 1, PVP is a polymeric structure that prevents its wrapping by hydrophobic groups [28]. Addressed herein; the Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was prepared using the precursor materials of Ru, Rh metals and PVP as a polymer material, characterized and its catalytic activity was investigated for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB at room temperature. The preparation of nanocatalyst was performed according to classical alcohol reduction technique and then prepared Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was tested for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB at various MeAB-Ru-Rh@PVP concentrations, temperatures and reusability performance at room temperature. For this reaction, one of the best TOF (initial turn over frequency, 206.2 min−1) value was obtained. The structure of prepared Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was examined by using analytical techniques such as TEM/EELS, HRTEM, XPS, P-XRD and UV–Vis spectra. These analytical techniques revealed that the PVP stabilized RuRh bimetallic nanoparticles were very well distributed on PVP polymer with the mean particle size of 3.42 ± 0.33 nm."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ruthenium (III) chloride trihydrate (RuCl3·3H2O), rhodium (III) chloride trihydrate (RhCl3·3H2O) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The MeAB used as substrate in the catalytic reactions was synthesized and characterized using the relevant literature [29]. All glassware was cleaned with deionized water purified by Millipore system. All glassware and a Teflon-coated stir bar were rinsed with acetone-ethanol, and eventually, all of them were dried in a temperature-controlled oven."
3,Characterization devices,"2.2 Characterization devices Samples to be studied using the transmission electron microscope (TEM) were first dissolved in a suitable solvent and placed in the copper-coated grid of the microscope. The solvent was evaporated under a 10−3 Torr pressure at room temperature. TEM analyzes were carried out on a JEOL 200 kV transmission electron microscope. Specs spectrometer was employed for XPS analysis (X-ray source Kα lines of Mg (1253.6 eV, 10 mA)). The powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD) patterns were acquired by using a Rigaku Ultima-IV with Cu-Ka radiation (wavelength 1.54 Å, 40 kV, 55 mA). To obtain UV–vis spectra, measurements were taken at 350–800 nm wavelength with a Lambda 750 spectrophotometer."
4,Preparation of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst and its catalytic activity in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of methylamine-borane,"2.3 Preparation of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst and its catalytic activity in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of methylamine-borane The preparation of the nanocatalyst was performed according to the alcohol-reduction method [30]. In this method, a solution of 50 mL H2O-C2H6O was prepared with 200 mg (2.5 mmol, monomeric units) PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) a mixture of 0.125 mmol of RhCl3·3H2O and 0.125 mmol of RuCl3·3H2O according to the alcohol-reduction technique, and the temperature was brought to 90 °C and boiled for 2 h. The solution obtained at the end of the process was found to have a darker solution compared to the former one. The resultant change in the color of the solution appears to be due to a reduction in the metal ions in the solution. The catalytic activity of prepared nanocatalyst was determined in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB by measuring the released hydrogen gas burette system. An apparatus consisted of jacketed glass burette, a reaction tube, magnetic stirrer, and water circulator was used to measure the released hydrogen gas by observing the change in the water level. A 10-x mL Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst mixture was placed in the reaction vessel and allowed to stand for 15 min to reach the thermal equilibrium. A related volume of solution containing MeAB (1 mmol, 46 mg) was transferred to the reaction vessel which had reached thermal equilibrium with a syringe. The reaction was initiated by stirring the reaction vessel at a stirring rate of 750 rpm. The volume of released gas was measured by the change of water level."
5,Calculation of activation energy and kinetic parameters in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB catalyzed by Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst,"2.4 Calculation of activation energy and kinetic parameters in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB catalyzed by Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst A set of experiments with different Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst (in a range of 1–3 mM) and MeAB concentrations (in a range of 100–300 mM) was performed to see the effect of the concentrations of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst and MeAB substrate on the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB. Also, Arrhenius and Eyring-Polanyi curves of the obtained data at different temperatures are plotted. The slope of this plot was used to calculate the kinetic parameters (Ea, ΔH≠ and ΔS≠) of hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB."
6,The recyclability performance of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst and its effect on the % conversion of MeAB,"2.5 The recyclability performance of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst and its effect on the % conversion of MeAB Five cycles tests were performed to determine the recyclability of the Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB. In the cycle experiments performed under room conditions. When each cycle was over, the reaction was restarted by adding equal amounts of MeAB to the reaction vessel. The nanocatalyst activity and percent conversion of MeAB for each cycle were calculated by using initial TOF and total volume of hydrogen gas, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,"In the preparation of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst, the alcohol-reduction method was used, and the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in the preparation process acted both as stabilizing and reducing agent. The catalyst solution was refluxed for 2 h, and with the reduction of the metals, the color of the solution darkened according to the initial state. It can be understood that the reduction of occurring from Ru+3/Rh+3 to Ru0/Rh0. When the spectrum of the resulting solution as given in Fig. 1 is examined, the reduction state of the metals will be understood better. The broadband around 660 and 516 nm thought to be Ru+3, and Rh+3 d-d transitions were disappeared by reduction after the reflux. That shows the conversion of metal (Ru+3/Rh+3) ions into neutral metals (RuRh) [31,32]. After UV–vis analyses, TEM images for some different patterns of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst show the presence of nanoparticles in the prepared catalyst. TEM and HRTEM (inset) images are shown in Fig. 2(a) which shows that the atomic lattice fringe of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was found to be 0.22 nm which is smaller than the atomic lattice fringe of Ru (100) values [33,34]. This case clearly indicates the alloy formation of Ru-Rh@PVP. Besides, the particle size (3.42 nm) of prepared nanoparticles was calculated by counting more than 100 of RuRh nanoparticles using the NIH program (Fig. 2(b) [33,34]. Besides, as shown in Fig. 2(c), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) line profile also indicates the alloy formation of Ru and Rh in the prepared Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst. The XPS analysis was conducted to reveal the oxidation state and chemical structure of the elements present on the Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 3(a–c). Fig. 3(a) indicates the presence of O, N, C which is coming from PVP stabilizer, Ru and Rh elements on PVP stabilized nanocatalyst. The high-resolution Ru 3p XPS spectrum of Ru NPs@PVP is seen in Fig. 3(b) which contains two distinctive peaks for Ru 3p3/2, and 3p1/2 at around 460.8 and 463.9 eV, corresponding to the Ru (0) 3p3/2 (metallic Ru NPs) and Ru (IV) 3p1/2. Fig. 3(b) also indicated that Rh was mostly seen in metallic character in prepared Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst [31–32]. Further, there is also a small amount of Rh (III) in the prepared nanocatalyst. The morphology and crystal structure of monodisperse Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was investigated with X-ray diffraction technique. As a control experiment, XRD patterns of PVP, Ru@PVP, and Rh@PVP were given in order to confirm the formation of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst. The observed peak at approximately 23.7° in Fig. 4 is related to PVP polymer [35,36]. Diffraction peaks were observed in the XRD pattern of Rh@PVP at 41, 47.7 and 69.7°, which can be attributed to the face-centered cubic (fcc) Rh (111), Rh (200) and Rh (220) respectively [37,38]. On the other hand, the diffraction peaks observed in the XRD pattern of Ru@PVP at 42.3, 68.7 and 78.1 are interpreted as fcc-Ru (101), (110) and (103), respectively [39]. As shown in Fig. 4, the diffraction peaks of both Ru and Rh elements in the XRD pattern of the Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst were observed in approximately the same regions, confirming that the Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst formed alloy. After full characterization of prepared nanomaterials, to detect the effect of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst to the hydrogen generation from the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB, various experiments were done at different temperatures and nanocatalyst/MeAB concentrations. Before starting kinetic studies, the catalytic activity of bimetallic Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of methylamine-borane was compared with PVP stabilized monometallic forms (Ru@PVP; Rh@PVP) in terms of initial turn-over frequency (mol of H2 / mol of cat. × min) and bimetallic Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst were found to be more effective than monometallic forms (Fig. 5 ). The catalytic activities of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst together with its bimetallic counterparts in different molar compositions were investigated in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB ([MeAB] = 200 mM; [cat] = 1 mM) at 298 K and their results are given in Fig. 6 . Clearly, the Ru0.5Rh0.5@PVP nanocatalyst provides better catalytic activity in terms of initial turn-over frequency than the other nanocatalysts at different RuRh molar compositions prepared by the same method. A set of experiments with different nanocatalyst concentrations in a range of 1–3 mM at room temperature was performed, and these experimental results are given in Fig. 7(a). As seen in Fig. 7(a) the hydrogen release began immediately without any induction time as soon as adding MeAB, and the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB reaction continuous until 3 equivalent hydrogens was formed. It was seen that the graph obtained by increasing catalyst concentration was linear. This obtained linear graph was plotted against the logarithmic data of the nanocatalyst concentration, and the slope was found to be 0.923 (Fig. 7(b). The MeAB catalytic reaction with this result is in the 0.92nd order depending upon the nanocatalyst concentration. Another set of experiments with various concentrations of MeAB as a substrate (100, 150, 200, 250, 300 mM) was done with a constant nanocatalyst concentration at room temperature, and the results of hydrogen volume are given in Fig. 8(a). Fig. 8(b) shows the conversion of the data to logarithmic values and the catalytic reaction obtained at different substrate concentrations was found to be 0.51th order. The effect of temperature on the catalytic activity of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB was examined by conducting five experiments at different temperatures in a range of 288–308 K at constant nanocatalyst (1.0 mM) and substrate concentration (200 mM). For this purpose, Fig. 9 shows the volume of hydrogen evolution from MeAB hydrolysis catalyzed Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst at different temperatures. The results of those experiments revealed that Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst has high catalytic activity in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB even at low temperature 288 K). From this graph, it can be seen that Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst has a high efficiency with 206.2 mol H2/(mol catalyst × min) initial TOF value in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB and catalytic reaction is completed in a short time (300 s) at room temperature. Some TOF values of catalyst system done for hydrolytic dehydrogenation reaction of MeAB in the literature are summarized in Table 1. As seen in Table 1, Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst is one of the best effective catalysts for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB at room temperature. When the data for the various temperature experiments (288, 293, 298, 303, 308 K) were plotted, a linear graph was obtained as shown in Fig. 9(a) activation energy (Ea = 43.5 kJ/mol), activation enthalpy (ΔH≠ = 41.18 kJ/mol) and activation entropy (ΔS≠ = −104.25 J/mol K) were calculated from Fig. 9(b) and (c) (Arrhenius and Eyring plots) for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB. The high positive value of ΔH≠ and negative value of ΔS≠ implies the presence of an associative mechanism in the transition state [40]. Several experiments were performed to determine the recycle activity of the Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst. A total of 5 cycles were made in these experiments, and the amount of substrate taken each time was equivalent to the initial amount. When the complete conversion occurred, the same amount of MeAB was added to the reaction media, and then the cycle was started again. It was detected that Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst maintains its initial activity of 67% and almost 100% conversion of MeAB occurred at the end of the 5th cycle as seen in Fig. 10(a). The forming of metaborate anions at the end of MeAB catalytic reaction and metal clumping on the surface of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst can be reasoned to the decrease of catalytic activity (~33%) of the prepared nanocatalyst [41-54]. The characterization of the Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was done using TEM analysis after the recyclability experiments. In the TEM image shown in Fig. 10(b), the agglomerations in white circled are the clearest indication of the loss of efficiency."
8,Conclusions,"Herein, Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was prepared (according to alcohol-reduction method) using RuRh precursors decorated on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and then prepared Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was tested in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB at various concentrations of MeAB and Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst, temperatures, and recyclability. The structure of Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was examined by using advanced analytical and spectroscopic techniques such as TEM/EELS, HRTEM, XPS, and UV–vis spectra. These techniques revealed that RuRh nanoparticles were well distributed on the PVP with the average particle size of 3.42 ± 0.33 nm. The Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst used for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB showed a very good catalytic activity (TOF initial = 206.2 min−1) compared to the other studies in literature as shown in Table 1. Activation energy (Ea = 43.5 kJ/mol), activation enthalpy (ΔH≠ = 41.18 kJ/mol) and activation entropy (ΔS≠ = −104.25 J/mol K) were calculated from Fig. 6(b) and (c) (Arrhenius and Eyring plots) for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of MeAB. After five cycles, the Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst retains its initial catalytic activity of 67.0%, and almost 100% conversion of MeAB has occurred at room temperature. The kinetic studies for MeAB catalyzed Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst was performed depending on the different substrate-catalysts concentration and temperatures, and these studies revealed that the rate of hydrogen release was to be 0.92nd order and 0.52nd order depend on catalyst and substrate concentrations, respectively. As a conclusion, Ru-Rh@PVP nanocatalyst with those superior properties can also be used in fuel cells and also many other reactions with very high efficiency."
