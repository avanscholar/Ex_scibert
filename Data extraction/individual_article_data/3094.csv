0,Introduction,"Phosphorothioates of the form (RO)3P(=S) [1] are commonly used as agricultural and residential pesticides. Common phosphorothioate pesticides take the form (ArO)P(=S)(OEt)2 that include parathion, coumaphos, and diazinon (Fig. 1 ); they all act as neurotoxin acetylcholine esterase inhibitors [2]. Given the prevalence of organophosphate neurotoxins found in stream waters, [3] there is a need for safe and effective means to degrade these pesticides in the environment. Hydrolysis is the common method for degrading phosphorothioate neurotoxins, [4–6] and in some cases heterogeneous supports and matrices have been used [7–9]. Solid supports are operationally advantageous because of the convenience associated with product separation. Indeed, clay has been found to degrade some organophosphate pesticides albeit very slowly [10,11]. To that end, a variety of active metal complexes have been supported on silica [12], and on MOF [13] that accelerate the degradation. In this connection, this report presents the first case of a metal-peroxo polymer that accelerates the degradation of phosphorothioate pesticides in an alcohol solvent. Alcoholysis of organophosphate neurotoxins [14] by metal complexes has been reported even for supported systems [15]. An alcohol matrix is advantageous because of the poor water solubility of most phosphorothioates and in some systems, the rates were faster in an alcohol media [16] than in water solution. While peroxide [17–19] and ozone [20] -promoted degradation of phosphorothioates are known, they inevitably form the toxic oxon [21] [(ArO)P(=O)(OEt)2] in a desulfurization reaction (Eq. (1)). (1) This report reveals conditions for phosphorothioate pesticide degradation that does not yield oxon formation with the operational advantages of heterogeneous catalysis. Moreover, for the pesticide diazinon, the commodity chemical diethyl phosphite is the main product which represents a form of phosphorus recovery from an organophosphate neurotoxin [22]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Equipment and materials,"2.1 Equipment and materials All 31P, 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance-300 spectrometer at 121.495, 300.130 and 75.468 MHz, respectively. IR spectra of the molybdenum compounds were obtained with a Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer as nujol mull. Reactions for Arrhenius plots were run in either a Fischer Scientific Isotemp Refrigerated Circulator (Model 9000) or on an IKA RCT hot plate/stirrer. All UV-Vis spectra were obtained with an Agilent 8453 UV–Vis spectrometer. Molybdenum compounds such as bis(acetylacetonato)dioxomolybdenum(VI), MoO3 and molybdenum powder (99.999%) were from Alpha Aesar, and aqueous H2O2 (27–30%) was from Sigma Aldrich. All phosphorothioate pesticides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or ChemService and used as is. The corresponding oxons (i.e. paraoxon and coumoxon) were purchased from Chemical Services, and the Diaion CR20 polystyrene beads were a gift from Mitsubishi Chemical Co. Elemental analyses were conducted by ALS Environmental (Tuscon AZ), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were carried out at the Center for Electron Microscopy and Nanofabrication facility at Portland State University (USA). Gas chromatography-mass spectral analyses were done at the Pankow Mass Spectrometry Facility (Portland State University, USA). The solution analog dioxo-2,6-bis[hydroxyl(methyl)amino]-4-morpholino-1,3,5-triazine molybdate(VI) (1) [23] was made from cyanouric acid, morpholine, N-methylhydroxylamine-HCl (TCI America) and bis(acetylacetonato)dioxomolybdenum(VI). The analog oxodiperoxo(pyridine-2-carboxylato)molybdate(VI) (2) [24] was made according to prior literature reports from pyridine-2-carboxylic acid (TCI America) molybdenum trioxide. The supported molybdenum-peroxo catalyst, abbreviated as Mo-Y(s), was synthesized according to a modified procedure [25]. Specifically, molybdenum powder (0.75 g, 7.8 mmole) was added in small portions to 10 mL of aqueous 30% hydrogen peroxide (327 mmole) over the course of ∼2 min at room temperature without excessive foaming. The solution initially became opaque with a dark green hue but transitioned to translucent (bright) yellow over the course of the molybdenum addition. Diaion CR20 polymeric beads (2.15 g) were slowly added to the stirring yellow suspension over the course of 20 min. The suspension was stirred slowly (magnetically) to avoid damaging the beads. After ∼18 h of gentle stirring, the bright yellow beads were filtered on a fritted funnel and washed with DI water (100 mL) followed by diethyl ether and dried overnight under vacuum at room temperature. Elemental analysis for Mo-Y(s): C, 56.66; H 5.80; N 3.67; Mo 11.68. Elemental analysis for CR20 (No Mo added): C 72.70; H 8.95; N 8.35"
3,Kinetic runs,"2.2 Kinetic runs The title reaction was carried out in 1 dram vials with 50 mg of the Mo-Y(s) support (0.09 mmole molybdenum); the Mo content was based on elemental analyses of the Mo-Y(s) beads. The ethanol solvent (2.0 mL) was added to the Mo-Y(s) followed by addition of 60 μL of aqueous 30% H2O2 (0.60 mmole); this suspension was allowed to sit for 20–30 min. Kinetic runs commenced with the addition of 0.01 mmole of the phosphorothioate pesticide (2.3 μL for parathion, 2.2 μL for diazinon and 3.6 mg for coumaphos), and all kinetic runs were unstirred unless otherwise specified. At specific time intervals, the solution above the Mo-Y(s) beads/support was transferred from the vial into a 5 mm NMR tube without collecting any of the 0.5 mm beads. Following a 31P NMR spectrum, this solution was pipetted back to the 1 dram reaction vial containing the Mo-Y(s) beads/support. This process was repeated at various time points for kinetic runs wherein NMR acquisitions were done at the same temperature as the kinetic runs. For kinetic runs monitored with UV/Vis spectroscopy, the reactions were done in 1.0 mL EtOH (40 °C) with 30 μL of aqueous H2O2 (0.30 mmole). After the addition of 0.01 mmole of either parathion or coumaphos, 10 μL-aliquots of the EtOH reaction were taken at 5–20 min intervals and quenched in 1.5 mL 0.10 M NaOH. Product formation (i.e. p-nitrophenolate or chlorferon) was recorded at 400 nm and 374 nm for parathion and coumaphos, respectively. Rate constants for the oxidative degradation of the phosphorothioate were obtained with both 31P NMR and UV/Vis where the signals fit well to Eq. (2) where C is a constant: (2) P t = C ( 1 - e - kt ) In the case of UV/Vis, Pt is the absorbance at either 400 nm (parathion) or 374 nm (coumaphos) at time t. For NMR kinetic runs, the integrals from all signals (67 ppm starting material, 12 ppm diethyl phosphite, −4 to −6 ppm oxon and 2 ppm triethylphosphate) were combined, and Pt is ratio of the product integral (i.e. either diethyl phosphite or oxon) to the aforementioned total combined signals at time t. All kinetic plots obtained by either 31P NMR or UV/Vis were fitted to Eq. (2) with Solver (Excel) to obtain rate constant k. Solution (homogeneous) kinetic runs used 56.4 mg (0.103 mmole) of 2 in 1.5 mL of EtOH with the addition of 15 μL (0.15 mmole) of 30% H2O2(aq). Following dissolution of 2 in a 1 dram vial at 60 °C (∼5 min), the ethanolic solution of 2 was transferred into a NMR tube, set to the desired temperature and 31P NMR accumulation commenced after addition of 0.01 mmole of the pesticide. All 31P NMR collection (both heterogeneous and homogeneous) used 64 scans with a 3 s delay. Prior studies with a similar protocol found that changing the pulse delay did not affect the rate constant [26]. Appearance of products were fitted to Eq. (2) to attain pseudo-first order rate constants for the homogeneous degradation by 2."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Mo-Y(s) material and peroxide activation,"3.1 Mo-Y(s) material and peroxide activation The oxidation of Mo(s) powder with H2O2 (aq) generates a canary-yellow solution referred to as Mo-Y(l). This yellow solution was postulated [27,28] to be a polyoxomolybdate consisting of a chain of Mo–O–Mo (μ-oxo) linkages that carried out homogeneous alkene oxidation chemistry with H2O2 addition. This polyoxomolybdate (Mo-Y(l)) was immobilized on the CR20 poly(ethyleneamine) support (0.5 mm beads), and will now be referred to as Mo-Y(s); as a modified polystyrene polymer (see table of contents Figure), CR20 has been used as a metal ion chelator.[29] The original protocol [25] was used to support the molybdenum peroxide functionality (Mo-Y(l)) on the CR20 polymer. The Mo-Y(s) support was exhaustively washed with water and ether after loading with the molybdenum peroxide; the washes initially were dull yellow and ended up colorless. IR spectroscopy of crushed Mo-Y(s) beads revealed a prominent Mo = O 943 cm−1 stretch with weaker peroxo stretches at 870 and 580 cm−1 (SI Fig S1). There is a strong 909 cm-1 stretch, and a prior report of dried Mo-Y(l) attributed this stretch to a μ-oxo functional group [27,28]. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on Mo-Y(s) showed modification of the CR20 beads resulted in the surface attachment of molybdenum that was previously absent (SI Fig. S2A). To this end, Mo elemental analysis gave 11.68% which is close to the 10% reported previously [25], and subsequent Mo loading is based on this percentage of molybdenum content. The oxygen atoms on the Mo-Y(s) are a combination of Mo = O, Mo(OO) peroxo, and Mo–O–Mo functionalities that originate from the added H2O2 (aq). Both elemental analysis and EDX yield (calculations in SI Fig. S2B) ratios of oxygens to molybdenum of 5.3:1 and 3:1, respectively. The Mo-Y(s) polymer was originally used for epoxidation of alkenes in the presence of excess tert-butylhydroperoxide [25], and a similar protocol was used for the oxidative degradation of phosphorothioates (0.01 mmole) on Mo-Y(s) beads (0.09 mmole Mo) in EtOH. In this case, there was an excess of aqueous H2O2 (0.60 mmol); the reaction does work in tBuOOH but at a much slower and impractical rate. IR spectroscopy (Fig. 2 ) of the Mo-Y(s) beads exposed to this H2O2 (aq) (no pesticides added) indicate a change had taken place with regard to the Mo = O and peroxo Mo(OO) functionalities. After a three-hour exposure to 60 μL 30% H2O2 (aq) in EtOH, the beads were isolated, dried and submitted to IR spectroscopy (Nujol mull). The most telling IR signature is the decrease in the 940 cm-1 Mo = O stretch and the prominent increase in the Mo(OO) peroxo stretches at 870 and 580 cm-1 [30]. This suggests the role of the added H2O2 is conversion of the Mo = O functionality to the peroxo Mo(OO) group [31,32] (Eq. (3)); multiple Mo = O groups could be involved. (3) A noteworthy feature for Eq. (3) is that tBuOH is seen by 13C NMR (SI Fig. S3) when tBuOOH is used over Mo-Y(s) in MeOH-d 4. As a control, no formation of tBuOH is seen when tBuOOH(aq) alone is incubated in MeOH-d 4 under the identical conditions. A similar reaction (i.e. Eq. (3)) with H2O2 would yield H2O that is problematic to track in an alcoholic solvent with aqueous H2O2. Dry urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) was ineffective in promoting phosphorothioate degradation over Mo-Y(s). The IR and 13C NMR results taken together support the Mo = O transformation in Eq. (3) which suggest the active species is a molybdenum-peroxo functionality either on the Mo-Y(s) surface or leached into solution."
6,Phosphorothioate pesticide degradation by Mo-Y(s),"3.2 Phosphorothioate pesticide degradation by Mo-Y(s) The phosphorothioate pesticides fall into two categories with regard to the degradation products over Mo-Y(s) in EtOH. In class 1 (parathion and coumaphos), the two products seen by 31P NMR are the oxon [(ArO)P(=O)(OEt)2] (−4 ppm) and diethyl phosphite (12 ppm) as shown in Fig. 3 . Diazinon belongs to a class 2 pesticide where only diethyl phosphite is formed upon incubation over Mo-Y(s) in EtOH. In both classes, a minute amount of triethyl phosphate is seen at ∼2 ppm that results from diethyl phosphite. A control reaction of just diethyl phosphite + Mo-Y(s) in EtOH yields triethyl phosphate, and no such reaction is observed in the absence of the Mo-Y(s). All the aforementioned products were verified through authentic addition (SI Fig. S4) and observation of the large 31P-1H coupling constant (1JPH = 702 Hz) for the 12 ppm diethyl phosphite signal. Conversion of phosphorothioate diazinon into primarily diethyl phosphite is unique as prior oxidative degradation methods such as ozonation [33] yield primarily the oxon. To that end, Casida and coworkers [34] reported formation of diethyl phosphite in the oxidation of diethyl phenyl phosphorothioate by magnesium monoperoxyphthalate. They described this finding as one of “greater interest” that was “unanticipated” because it results from the reduction of the phosphorus center under oxidative conditions [34]. In their prior case, oxidation of phosphorothioates yields a mixture of oxon and diethyl phosphite. However, in the case of diazinon degradation over Mo-Y(s), we report the first example of primarily diethyl phosphite formation under oxidative conditions. GC/MS analysis of the headspace gas above the oxidative degradation for both parathion and diazinon reveals the presence of SO2. Under oxidative conditions this gets further oxidized to SO4 2- as reported in the oxidative degradation of diazinon [35]. A few critical controls were undertaken to examine the role of the Mo-Y(s) beads. First, there was negligible absorption of all pesticide products onto the Mo-Y(s) beads. This was seen when various organophosphates are incubated with Mo-Y(s) in the presence of an external standard in a coaxial NMR insert. When compared with product species that were never exposed to Mo-Y(s), the integrals for the oxon, diethyl phosphite and triethyl phosphate changed by less than 5% (4 h exposure) when they were exposed to Mo-Y(s) (no H2O2 (aq)). Second, neither the CR20 beads (no Mo added) without H2O2 nor H2O2(aq) alone degraded the phosphorothioate pesticide. The third control indicated the importance of the added H2O2; the Mo-Y(s) beads alone are inactive in degrading the pesticides. Finally, the third set of controls examined how the leached material from Mo-Y(s) in EtOH was responsible for the pesticide degradation. This protocol involved incubating the Mo-Y(s) beads in 30% H2O2 (aq) for 30 min, and prior to adding the phosphorothioate pesticide, the solid beads were filtered away leaving just the leached Mo-Y liquid. Each of the three pesticides were exposed to the leached material and product formation was recorded. It is important to note that the leached material degrades these phosphorothioates but at a slower rate compared to the heterogeneous Mo-Y(s) reaction as shown in Fig. 4 and SI Fig. S5. Whereas pesticide degradation by Mo-Y(s) at 50 °C is over in less than five hours, the leached material takes three days to completely degrade the phosphorothioate pesticides under the same conditions. This is shown in Fig. 4 where 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to calculate the rate constant (Eq. (2)). The formation of degradation products from the leached liquid (“X”) is overlaid on the product formation plots by MoY(s). It should be noted that exhaustive leaching of Mo-Y(s) (25 h incubation in 60 μL 30% H2O2 (aq) (50 °C) yields a yellow liquid that accomplishes pesticide degradation just as fast as the heterogeneous conditions shown in Fig. 4. To that end, the role and activity of this leached material is the subject of future investigation."
7,Excess parathion and diazinon degradation by Mo-Y(s),"3.3 Excess parathion and diazinon degradation by Mo-Y(s) The initial report [25] for Mo-Y(s) beads stated they could be regenerated by incubation in 30% H2O2 (aq) and up to five cycles of alkene epoxidation was achieved with Mo-Y(s). In this connection, the ability of Mo-Y(s) to degrade excess phosphorothioate was investigated. The kinetic runs were done with 9-fold excess molybdenum (as determined by elemental analysis) loading relative to the phosphorothioate (See Materials and Methods – Kinetic Runs). In contrast, 5 mg of the Mo-Y(s) (0.01 mmole Mo metal determined by elemental analysis) degraded five molar equivalents of parathion (11.5 μL) or diazinon (11 μL) in 30 μL (0.30 mmole) of 30% H2O2 (aq) in a “one pot” reaction; this underscores the turnover ability of the Mo-Y(s) beads in degrading the phosphorothioate pesticides."
8,Diethyl phosphite kinetics determined from UV/Vis spectroscopy,"3.4 Diethyl phosphite kinetics determined from UV/Vis spectroscopy The unique feature of this report is the production of diethyl phosphite, and this is elaborated in terms of the substrate specificity and activation parameters. Diethyl phosphite product, (i.e. 12 ppm signal) results from the departure of the aryl leaving group. Therefore, one would expect formation of the diethyl phosphite to correlate with appearance of the p-nitrophenolate (400 nm) or chloroferon (374 nm) for parathion and coumaphos degradation, respectively. Therefore, both chromophores provide a convenient UV/Vis marker for monitoring the kinetics of phosphorothioate degradation over Mo-Y(s) (SI Fig. S6A and B). Unfortunately, this was not possible with the 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol leaving group of diazinon. The 260 nm absorption of the pyrimidine leaving group was overshadowed by the strong UV background signal of the solution material above the Mo-Y(s) beads. The rate of leaving group formation for parathion and coumaphos, as determined by UV/Vis, is similar to the rate of diethyl phosphite formation as determined through 31P NMR (SI Fig. 7A and B). The near-identical first order rate constants suggest (1) leaving group departure is correlated with diethyl phosphite production and (2) the viability of using UV/Vis spectroscopy to monitor degradation kinetics. In this connection, UV/Vis spectroscopy was used to examine how the rate of diethyl phosphite formation depended on the amount of Mo-Y(s) beads. There are two dependencies on the molybdenum (Fig. 5 A and B) when the rates of leaving group formation were plotted as a function of mmole of Mo in the Mo-Y(s) beads. In the case of coumaphos (Fig. 5B) there was a linear dependency on the Mo loading (0.02–0.30 mmole), and any higher loading of Mo-Y(s) (>250 mg) left little or no EtOH solvent for UV/Vis sampling. Therefore, saturation kinetics was not observed for coumaphos in the range of Mo-Y(s) beads used. The same behavior was observed in the methanolysis of the phosphorothioate fenitrothion by silica- and polystyrene- immobilized ortho-palladated dimethylbenzylamine complex [15]. On the other hand, parathion (Fig. 5A) exhibited well-behaved saturation kinetics where the rates of p-nitrophenolate formation leveled out at 0.20 mmole of Mo(s)/mL EtOH. These results underscore the fact that diethyl phosphite production (as determined by UV/Vis) is a substrate-specific phenomenon when it comes to using the Mo-Y(s) support."
9,Activation parameters for Mo-Y(s) kinetics,"3.5 Activation parameters for Mo-Y(s) kinetics Both UV/Vis and 31P NMR methods were used to attain activation parameters for the phosphorothioate → diethyl phosphite transformation. Rate constants measured at different temperatures yielded an Arrhenius plot (SI Fig. S8) to give enthalpy and entropy of activations for coumaphos and parathion degradation by Mo-Y(s). From Table 1 , the coumaphos → diethyl phosphite have almost identical ΔHǂ values when determined by UV/Vis (13.6 kcal/mol) or by 31P NMR (14.0 kcal/mol) methods, and the respective entropy of activations (−14.5 cal/mol-K by UV/Vis versus −12.6 cal/mol-K by 31P NMR) are within one standard deviation. While the same consistency cannot be said for the parathion → diethyl phosphite transformation, consideration has to be taken for the fact that these measurements were made from different prepared batches of Mo-Y(s) beads. Given that two different methods were used to track the reaction, there is a degree of confidence that the coumaphos → diethyl phosphite transformation by Mo-Y(s) has enthalpy and entropy of activations of 13–14 kcal/mole and −12 to −15 cal/mol·K, respectively. Likewise, the parathion → diethyl phosphite transformation have ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ values that lie in a larger range (ΔH‡ = 17–21 kcal/mol and ΔS‡ = −4 to −7.5 cal/mol·K) as determined by both UV/Vis and 31P NMR. In terms of comparisons with other heterogeneous reactions, hydrolysis of diazinon over iron oxide has been reported [35] to have a ΔH‡ = 10.8 kcal/mol and ΔS‡ = −26.3 cal/mol·K. This (Table 1) shows that pesticide degradation over Mo-Y(s) has a higher activation energy barrier and goes through a less ordered transition state compared to iron oxide. Toxic oxon formation was tracked with 31P NMR for parathion and coumaphos, and an Arrhenius plot (SI Fig. S9) yielded a ΔH‡ of 15.4 ± 0.1 kcal/mole for the coumaphos → coumaoxon oxidation which was lower than the ΔH‡ for the parathion → paraoxon conversion. One strategy for decreasing oxon formation by the Class 1 phosphorothioate pesticides involved a solvent switch. Typically, in EtOH, parathion produces 20–30% oxon as determined by 31P NMR. However, when the solvent is switched to acetonitrile, there is no oxon production; it has the same 31P NMR profile as Fig. 3B. Controls of just the oxon (i.e. paraoxon) in acetonitrile over Mo-Y(s) show no reactivity over three days (i.e. oxon is stable over Mo-Y(s)); therefore, the absence of oxon formation is inherent in the oxidative degradation of parathion. This phenomenon has not been observed previously with oxidation of parathion; paraoxon is always formed. However, this solvent-switch protocol does not work for coumaphos; oxon formation in Fig. 3A is still present in acetonitrile. The lower ΔH‡ for the coumaphos → coumoxon versus the parathion → paraoxon transformations (Table 1) supports this observation as oxon formation is relatively facile for coumaphos."
10,Solution models of Mo-Y(s),"3.6 Solution models of Mo-Y(s) A chief assumption in the degradation of these pesticides is the activation of the molybdenum-oxo functionality to the molybdenum-peroxide which was further examined with discrete solution systems. As such, dioxo-2,6-bis[hydroxyl(methyl)amino]-4-morpholino-1,3,5-triazine-molybdate(VI) (1) [23] and oxodiperoxo(pyridine-2-carboxylato)molydate(VI) (2) [24] were tested to support this hypothesis. Molecule 2 was chosen because a prior report [36] found it to have near-identical thermodynamic values as Mo-Y(s) in the oxidative ethanolysis of phosphonothioates. Molecule 1 serves as a negative control since it does not have any peroxo functionality. For complex 1 in EtOH, no pesticide degradation was seen with any of the three pesticides investigated. However, slight phosphorothioate degradation was seen upon addition of H2O2(aq) to this dioxomolybdate complex. This is consistent with the notion set in Equation (3) for the role of H2O2 in activating the Mo = O functionality, which prompts investigating the oxodiperoxomolydate complex 2 in EtOH. In the absence of H2O2, formation of the diethyl phosphite and the corresponding oxon was seen; product 31P NMR signals were identical to those seen with heterogeneous Mo-Y(s) reactions. While parallels between 2 (in EtOH) and the Mo-Y(s) are drawn, there are operational differences. Compound 2 is crystallized from MeOH as the Mo(VI) complex with an outer sphere pyridine-2-carboxylic acid ligand [24]. In this connection, ethanolic reactions of 2 with the pesticides yielded a precipitate with an IR spectrum identical to the starting 2; a DMSO solution of this precipitate did not yield a 31P NMR signal. Furthermore, upon formation of the precipitate, the reaction in EtOH does not reach to completion even when seven to ten-fold excess of 2 is used. These solubility issues in EtOH are alleviated when H2O2 (aq) is added at high temperatures (>40 °C). The addition of 15 μL 30% H2O2 (aq) prevents precipitation of 2, and above 40 °C the products resemble those seen under heterogeneous degradation over Mo-Y(s) (Fig. 3); the addition of just 15 μL H2O did not yield products. All kinetic runs by solution model 2 (30–70 °C) were summarized as Arrhenius plots (SI Fig. S11) for all three pesticides that yielded activation parameters set in Table 2 . In a prior report, [36] complex 2 and Mo-Y(s) were used for the ethanolysis of O, S – diethylphenyl phosphonothioate, and the activation parameters compared very well between the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. However, in this case (Table 2), the correlation of activation parameters between heterogeneous (i.e. Mo-Y(s)) and homogeneous (i.e. 2 in EtOH/H2O2) systems is mixed. For the degradation of coumaphos, complex 2 and Mo-Y(s) have ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ parameters close to one another. This suggest the diperoxo compound 2 is a reasonable solution model for this class 2 pesticide wherein only diethyl phosphite is formed. In this connection, diazinon degradation has solution and heterogeneous activation parameters that are close to one another for diethyl phosphite production. Finally, none of the activation parameters for the solution degradation of parathion correlate well with the heterogeneous reaction."
11,Conclusion,"A new protocol for the degradation of phosphorothioate pesticides has been developed that uses a polystyrene-supported peroxo-molybdate complex (Mo-Y(s)). In addition to the operational advantages of a heterogeneous reaction, the support degrades up to 10 equivalents of phosphorothioates per molybdenum on the Mo-Y(s). The target pesticides are parathion, coumaphos and diazinon, all of which share structural similarities with regard to the diethyl phosphorothiate functionality. This degradation produces the corresponding oxon as well as the unexpected diethyl phosphite. However, in the case of diazinon, the reaction over Mo-Y(s) produces primarily diethyl phosphite; this represents the first case where a commodity chemical is produced in the degradation of a phosphorothioate neurotoxin. In this connection, parathion produces only diethyl phosphite when the solvent is switched to acetonitrile. Current efforts are devoted towards a mechanistic elucidation of this oxidative reaction and an investigation of the role and activity of the leached material."
