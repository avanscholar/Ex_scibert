0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has many positive attributes to qualify as an ideal energy carrier. It becomes even more attractive when hydrogen is produced by dissociation of water utilizing solar radiation. Photocatalysis is a promising technique to dissociate water utilizing solar radiation. Success of this technique will largely depend on (a) Development of semiconductor catalyst which gets activated by solar radiation i.e. its bandgap should be such that the energy of larger fraction of solar radiation is utilized for generation of electron-hole pairs (b) the conduction band of the semiconductor photocatalyst should be at a higher energy level compared to reduction potential of water facilitating photo-generated electrons to mediate the downhill reduction of water and (c) the recombination of photo-generated electron and hole is minimized. Cadmium sulphide (CdS) is one of the well-studied semiconductors for its relatively narrow band gap, 2.4eV, being able to absorb a broad range of solar light, and a flat-band potential, −0.9V versus normal hydrogen electrode, negative enough to reduce H+ [1,2]. However, CdS alone is not very attractive photocatalyst because of very rapid recombination of photogenerated electron and holes. Different strategies have been adopted to minimize this recombination. Literature reports use of noble metals, especially platinum [3,4] as cocatalyst. The photogenerated electrons migrate from the conduction band of the semiconductor photocatalyst to the noble metal because of its lower Fermi level compared to conduction band of semiconductor. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes stay at the host photocatalyst (Fig. 1 A). This result is an efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Literature [5–10] also reports that a combination of two semiconductors provides a hetro-junction which may be effective for charge separation. As shown in Fig. 1B, a photogenerated electron gets transferred from conduction band of one semiconductor to that of another semiconductor. The literature [11–14] reports enhanced activity of CdS when combined with other semiconductors of different band energies, such as TiO2, ZnO, LaMnO3, and CeO2. The photogenerated electrons in the CdS particles transfer to another semiconductor, whereas photogenerated holes stay in CdS. This prevents the electron-hole recombination to improve the photocatalytic activity. For this strategy to work it is essential that an intimate contact between the two semiconductors exists at the interface to facilitate transfer of electrons. Extensive work is going on to substitute platinum by rather cheaper materials. In this context, Graphene (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been used as reported in literature [15–18]. It has been reported that delocalized conjugated π-system presented in graphene can accept and transfer electrons efficiently to the reaction interface. Doping of graphene converts its into semiconductor having a tuneable bandgap. Doping by oxygen is most common (resulting material called GO). Doping with oxygen results into structured disorder due to formation of sp3 CO bonds damaging the conductive π-network. The conductivity could be partly restored by reducing graphene oxide (called rGO). Thus the reduced graphene oxide behaves like a semiconductor with excellent electron conductivity. Because of these two desirable properties, GO and rGO have been investigated as co-catalyst in photocatalytic decomposition of water [19–24]. Literature reports study on CdS-GO/rGO composite photocatalysts for H2 production. Such catalysts have been largely prepared by hydrothermal/solvothermal methods [24–26]. In all such studies, enhanced activities have been reported as compared to bare CdS. The enhanced activities are due to efficient charge separation and transport of electrons to the reaction interface as discussed above. It is evident from the literature that for the efficient photocatalysis the interface between CdS and GO/rGO is most crucial. The interface must facilitate transfer of the electrons and holes from CdS to GO/rGO or vice-versa. Earlier works [27,28] have been reported possibilities of interaction of C and S through π* of GO/rGO and n orbital of S or CdS. Such an interaction may promote a synergic effect at the interface for a better transfer of electrons and holes. Earlier work carried out in our laboratory has demonstrated that, CdS prepared by reacting solid cadmium sulphate with H2S gas (solid-gas reaction) at 573K resulted in formation of n-type CdS. It was concluded that the reaction carried out at an elevated temperature yielded the non-stoichiometric composition of CdS having a sulphur deficiency. The n-type CdS was found to be efficient for dissociation of water [29–31]. In this present work we have prepared CdS-GO/rGO photocatalysts by modifying the gas-solid reaction as discussed above. To our best of knowledge, CdS composite prepared by this technique has not been reported in the literature. We were guided by the fact that GO/rGO shows a p-type semiconductivity [32,33]. Therefore if the gas solid reaction results into formation on n-type CdS; the composite may form a p-n junction at the interface. Formation of such junction at the interface will facilitate the transfer of charges and hence a better photo-activity. In the present work we have also prepared bare CdS and CdS-rGO composite by hydrothermal technique for the comparison of activity. It is observed the CdS prepared by the gas-solid reaction had a better activity. Detailed characterization studies of catalysts are also reported. An existence of chemical interaction S of between CdS and carbon of GO/rGO at the interface of composite catalyst prepared by the gas-solid reaction is reported."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Graphite oxide (GO) was synthesized by following modified Hummers Method [34,35]. The final product (GO) was collected by vacuum filtration. It was repeatedly washed with 4% HCl solution followed by distilled water to remove by-products present as impurity. Finally, the oxidized graphite was dried in an oven at 333K for 4days to get graphite oxide (GO). For the preparation of rGO, 600mg of GO was dispersed in 300mL of H2O and sonicated for 2h. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 2 by addition of 37% HCl solution and then 1.2g Zn powder was added into the GO solution [36]. Sonication was further carried out for 30min. The top part of the solution turned transparent and black precipitate appeared at the bottom after the sonication. The excessive Zn powder was dissolved by adding 30mL of 37% HCl. The solid fraction was separated by vacuum filtration and the mass was dried in an air oven to get reduced graphene (rGO). In the present study, the following catalysts were prepared. Catalyst-1- It was unsupported CdS, prepared by gas-solid reaction. Requisite amount of granules of cadmium sulphate was placed into a fixed bed tubular reactor. The reactor was purged with N2 gas and subsequently pure H2S gas was passed at 573K for 4h to convert Cd-precursor to CdS. Catalyst-2- This catalyst was CdS supported on GO. Required amount of GO was added into a calculated volume of dilute ammonical solution of cadmium sulphate to have a weight ratio of 2:1 (2 part GO and one part CdS) in the final catalyst. The resulting mass was first dried on water bath at 358K with stirring and subsequently in oven at 383K for overnight. The dried granules were then put into fixed bed reactor and reacted with H2S gas in similar manner as was done for catalyst-1 (Fig. 2 ). Catalyst-3- This catalysts was rGO supported CdS. It was prepared in the same manner as catalyst-2 except that rGO was the support in place of GO. Catalyst-4- This catalyst was prepared by a hydrothermal method in which Cd-precursor (cadmium sulphate) was dissolved into ammonia solution to make a dilute solution, to which the required amount of rGO was added. A dilute aqueous solution of Na2S was then added slowly to this mixture till the precipitation was complete. The resulting mixture was put into Teflon-lined autoclave that was kept at oven for overnight at 453K. Final product was washed several times and finally dried at 343K. It is in order to mention that, in an earlier work in our laboratory [29–31], it was observed that use of ammonical solution of precursor resulted is a more active catalyst compared to an aqueous solution was used. Therefore, in the present work ammonical solution of cadmium sulphate were used."
3,Activity measurement,"2.2 Activity measurement The photocatalytic reaction for hydrogen production was carried out in a semi-batch flat-bottomed flask photoreactor (Pyrex glass), in which one side was made flat for the enhancement of light in the reactor. A 100W Oriel Mercury-Xenon lamp was employed as a light source. One gram of photocatalyst (∼200mesh size) was suspended into 250mL of aqueous solution of 0.01M sulphide (Na2S) and 0.004M sulphite (Na2SO3) as a sacrificial agent. The 8.6pH was maintained for the experiment by adding NaOH and acetic acid solution. Before the light irradiation, nitrogen gas was purged for 1h to remove dissolved O2 from solution. The evolved gas was collected by a water displacement technique and further analyzed by a gas chromatograph using a 5Å molecular sieve column attached with thermal conductivity detector. The results showed that the gas evolved in this experiment was pure hydrogen."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The IR spectra at room temperature in reflectance mode were obtained using Nicholet 5700 (Thermo Electron) FTIR spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained from a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer using Cu-Kα irradiation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected using TecnaiG2 20 at 200kV accelerating voltage. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of catalysts was carried out on UV–vis spectrophotometer (Varian 100Bio) with a total reflection attachment. BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard. Photoluminescence spectra were observed using Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary eclipse). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained on an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (AMICUS, Kratos Analytical) using monochromated Mg-Kα (1253.6eV) as X-ray source. Temperature-programmed oxidation of catalysts was carried out on a Micrometrics Pulse Chemisorb 2705. Oxygen (5% by volume) in argon was used for oxidation and the temperature was raised linearly at a rate of 5K per min from room temperature to 1173K."
5,Results & discussion,
6,Photocatalytic activity,"3.1 Photocatalytic activity The activity of catalysts as mL of H2 produced at NTP for 2h of irradiation is given in Table 1 . The reported values are average of number of repeated runs. It is order to mention that no hydrogen production was observed either in the absence of irradiation or without photocatalyst. Therefore, the following overall reaction was photocatalytic nature: (1) H 2 O + S 2 − + S 3 2 − → h ν H 2 + 2 OH − + S 2 O 3 2 − It is observed from the table that the activity of unsupported catalyst CdS was low (Catalyst-1). This is line with the results reported in literature [37,38]. Since, the catalyst was unsupported CdS, therefore, as discussed in the previous section, the photo-generated electrons-holes could not be effectively prevented from recombination and hence a low activity. The table also shows that catalyst-3 had a superior activity compared to catalyst-2. Catalyst-3 was CdS supported on rGO whereas catalyst-2 was CdS supported on GO. The preparation technique was same for both the catalysts. The higher activity of catalyst-3 compared to that of catalyst-2 is attributed to high electronic conductivity of rGO compared to GO [39]. A better conductivity would facilitate efficient transfer of electrons and thus restrict the recombination. A remarkable observation is that catalyst prepared by hydrothermal technique (catalyst-4) had a lower activity compared to cataltyst-3 which had same composition but prepared by gas-solid reaction. It is in order to mention that the hydrothermal technique is a most preferred technique reported in the literature for preparation of CdS supported on graphene [40,41]. We are for the first time reporting the preparation of CdS/rGO catalyst by impregnation followed reaction with H2S gas. It is order to mention that in earlier works in our laboratory [30,31] CdS supported on alumina was prepared by the same technique as in the present study, i.e. impregnation and then reacting CdSO4 with H2S gas at 573K. The better activity of the catalyst was attributed to the fact that the resulting CdS had a non-stoichiometric composition with sulphur deficiency. The sulphur deficiency made the CdS to behave n-type semiconductivity. Therefore, it is likely said that catalyst-2 and 3 which were prepared by impregnation of GO and rGO, respectively and reacting with H2S gas has resulted into formation of n-type CdS. The GO/rGO has p-type semiconductivity. Hence formation of a p-n junction with p-type GO/rGO is likely. It is known that formation of a p-n junction with result into a (i) more efficient charge separation and (ii) more rapid transfer of electrons to semiconductor to catalysts [42,43]. Certainly for the formation of a p-n junction, the formation of hetrojunction at the interface shall be crucial. It has been described below that a chemical interaction does exist between S of CdS and C of GO/rGO when catalysts were prepared by gas-solid reaction. Such chemical interaction was observed to be very insignificant in the catalyst prepared by hydrothermal technique. Therefore, we attribute the highest activity of catalyst-3 due to this to factors: (i) formation of p-n junction and (ii) higher electron conductivity of rGO as compared to GO."
7,Characterization studies,"3.2 Characterization studies 3.2.1 FTIR studies Fig. 3 shows the FTIR spectra of graphite, GO and rGO. As expected GO and rGO showed presence of several oxygen containing functional groups. The peak intensity of such groups diminished in rGO. Some of the prominent peaks were free and associated hydroxyl groups (3000–3500cm−1), epoxides (1300–1350cm−1), CO vibrations of ketones (1630 & 1739cm−1), CO in COH or COC functional groups (1057cm−1), the symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and deformation vibrations of epoxy groups (1220, 880, and 850cm−1), stretching vibration of CO or CO of carboxylic acid (1209cm−1) and COH of alcohol (1065cm−1) [44,45]. FTIR spectra of catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . The presence of oxygenated functional groups similar to GO and rGO is observed. A comparison reveals that on incorporation of CdS, stretching vibration of and COH of alcohol (1065cm−1) and CO vibrations of ketones (1630 & 1739cm−1) were diminished. Another significant observation is appearance of absorption peaks at ∼1550cm−1 in catalyst-2 and 3 which were CdS supported on GO/rGO and prepared by gas-solid reaction as described above. The literature reports [46] CS stretching frequency at ∼1570cm−1. Earlier workers have reported likelihood of electronic interactions between C and S through π* orbital of GO/rGO and n-orbital of S of CdS [28,47–49]. It is further observed that such an absorption peak is not seen in catalyst-4 (prepared by hydrothermal technique). The absorption band may also appear because of doping of sulphur in GO/rGO. Since during the preparation of catalyst-2 and 3, H2S gas was passed at high temperature, such doping may results in. Therefore, we concluded that either an interfacial electronic interaction between CdS and GO/rGO exist in catalyst-2 & 3, and it is largely absent in catalyst-4 or the GO/rGO has been doped with sulphur. 3.2.2 XRD studies Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of graphite, GO and rGO. Characteristic peaks of crystalline graphite at 2θ 26.54° (002), 44.47° (101), 54.66° (004) and 77.54° (112) are seen in Fig. 5a. The analysis of (002) peak of graphite gives an inter-planar spacing of 0.335nm. The XRD patterns of GO (Fig. 5b) and rGO (Fig. 5c) are in line with those reported in the literature [50,51]. An intense and sharp peak centred at 2θ=10.25° (001) which corresponds to an inter-planar spacing of 0.86nm was observed in GO. The larger interlayer spacing of GO compared to that of graphite is due to the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups [52]. In case of rGO (Fig. 5c), a small characteristic diffraction peak of graphite oxide (001) at approximately 10.68° is also observed. It indicates that reduction of GO by Zn dust in acidic medium was not completed and a few oxygen-containing functional groups still existed in the sample. A broad diffraction peak (002) of rGO at about 2θ=24° is also seen. The broadening and shift of the characteristic diffraction peak of graphite from 26.54° to 24° is due to the short-range order in stacks of layers in rGO. The interlayer spacing of rGO was 0.37nm, slightly larger than that of graphite. The enlargement in spacing may be due to presence of residual functional groups having oxygen-containing with other structural defects [53]. Fig. 6 shows the XRD pattern of catalyst-1 to 4. The peak positions were located and the d values were calculated by applying Bragg’s equation and are given in Table 2 . Standard values of the hexagonal (H) and cubic (C) phases of CdS are also given. A comparison of calculated d values with the standard data showed that all the peaks observed in catalysts-1 to 3 corresponded to cadmium sulphide with hcp structure. The characteristic peak of the cubic phase at d=2.91Å [54] was not observed in these samples. These catalysts were prepared by a gas-solid reaction as described earlier. While in catalyst-4 which was prepared by hydrothermal method, the characteristic peak of cubic phase of CdS at 2.90Å was also observed. Hydrothermal technique resulted in formation of CdS which was mixture of both cubic and hexagonal phases [55]. Sahu et al. [31] have explained that when ammonia is present during formation of CdS, it reduces the ionization of Cd2+ ions. This reduction in ionization may affect the stacking sequence in CdS crystal and cubic (zinc blend) structure can also form. In absence of ammonia, wurtzite (hcp) structure is favoured [56]. In our case, the appearance of cubic phase in catalyst-4 may be also due to the above factor where CdS is formed by precipitation in ammonical solution followed by a hydrothermal treatment. Whereas catalyst-2 and 3 where prepared by a high temperature reaction causing any pre-adsorbed ammonia to desorb. It is also in order to mention that the cubic phase of CdS is reported to have a lower activity [57–59]. Zhang et al. [59] have also reported that wurtzite CdS has stronger ionic character and consequently higher charge carrier mobility which results into a higher photocatalytic activity compared to zinc blend CdS. It should also be noted that two unidentified peaks (marked with *) were also observed in catalyst-3. It may be because of presence of some form of carbon in the sample. Unit cell parameters a and c of the hexagonal CdS were calculated using the formula (2) 1 d 2 = 4 3 ( h 2 + hk +k 2 a 2 ) + l 2 c 2 The d values of (110) and (002) planes were used. The values are shown in Table 3 . The reported values of a, c, and c/a for CdS are 4.121Å, 6.682Å and 1.621, respectively [60]. The calculated values nearly match with the experimental values. The XRD peaks of the catalysts were rather broad; therefore, exact location of peak position may not be very accurate. Hence, small variations in lattice parameters are considered insignificant and we reported no significant defect in crystal structure. In earlier work from our laboratory [29] it has been reported that CdS prepared by gas-solid reaction (same as in the present study) showed an n-type semiconductivity owing to deficiency in S with respect to stoichiometric composition have n-type semiconductivity. In absence of anything in courtesy, we assume that CdS presented in catalysts-1 to 3 prepared by gas-solid reaction have n-type semiconductivity. Mean crystallite sizes were estimated by measuring full width at half intensity of selected peaks. Instrumental broadening was subtracted from the total broadening and the Scherrer equation was used. Since the highest intensity peak of CdS (002) suffered from interference from diffraction pattern of rGO, crystallite sizes were calculated by measuring the broading of the (110) peaks for all the catalysts. The results are given in Table 3. It is seen from table that the catalyst prepared by hydrothermal technique (Catalyst-4) had a much lesser crystallite size (∼6nm) in comparison to those of catalyst-2 and 3 (∼29nm and ∼26nm, respectively). Still, catalyst-3 showed a much better activity compared to catralyst-4. Thus, the crystallite size cannot be taken as a sole criteria for a better activity; there are other microstructural properties which may be more responsible for the observed better activity of catalyst prepared by gas-solid reaction (catalyst-3). 3.2.3 TEM studies The TEM images of catalyst-2, 3 and 4 are shown in Fig. 7 . CdS particles are seen to be uniformly distributed on graphene. Average particle sizes were also calculated as ∼29nm, 27nm and 12nm for catalyst-2, 3 and 4, respectively (Table 3). These particle sizes are almost equal to the crystallite sizes calculation by XRD and reported above. Hence, agglomerations of crystallites are negligible in all the catalysts. Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) patterns for catalyst-2, 3 and 4 are shown in Fig. 8 . The d-spacings were calculated for all these catalysts. For catalyst-2 calculated values matched with standard values of the hexagonal phase of CdS, i.e. 3.36Å (002), 2.45Å (102), 2.06Å (110) and 1.89Å (103). Similarly for catalyst-3 also values matched with the hexagonal phase of CdS 3.36Å (002), 2.45Å (102), 2.06Å (110) and 1.89Å (103). However, the catalyst-4 showed the presence of both the cubic phase 2.90Å (200), with hexagonal phase 3.36Å (002), 2.06Å (110) and 1.89Å (103). The XRD analysis had also revealed that in catalyst-4 both the phases were present. As reported earlier, the cubic phase has a lower activity [57–59] and therefore, the presence of this phase could be one of the reasons of a lower activity of catalyst-4 as compared to catalyst-3 which contained only the hexagonal phase of CdS. The lower activity of catalyst-2 with respect to catalyst-4 is attributed to the fact that in the former GO was used whereas in the later rGO, which has a better electrical conductivity, was used. 3.2.4 Photoluminescence studies Fig. 9 shows PL spectra of catalysts-1 to 4 with the excitation wavelength of 200nm. For the sake of comparison PL of a physical mixture (well mixed in mortal and pestle) of CdS and GO (denoted as S1) was also recorded. The quantity of CdS and GO in S1 were in the same ratio as that in the catalysts. Strong emission peaks at about 530nm (corresponding to 2.4eV) were observed for all catalysts and S1 as well. Introduction of GO or rGO drastically decreased the PL intensities of GO/rGO supported catalysts (catalyst 2–4) in comparison to unsupported CdS (catalyst-1). Even sample S1 had lower intensity compared to unsupported CdS. The PL intensity has been reported to correlate with the electron-hole recombination [61]. Greater the recombination, more intense shall be the PL intensity. In other words, if PL intensity is less, more electrons should be available to carry out the reduction of water to H2. The above observation can be explained on the basis of high conductivity and the relative position of Fermi level of GO and rGO. The lowest conduction band potential of CdS and the Fermi level of rGO are −0.65V and −0.08V versus NHE, respectively [62]. Therefore the photogenerated electrons of CdS could be transferred to GO or rGO. It is also observed that catalyst-2, 3, 4 and Sample S1 all had same composition still the PL intensities were different. The lowest PL intensity observed in catalyst-3 implies that recombination of electron-hole pairs has been minimum. For transfer of electron from CdS to GO/rGO an intimate contact at the interface would be necessary. As stated earlier (Section 3.2.1), electronic interaction between the n-orbital of the sulphur of CdS and π* orbital of GO/rGO may take place, which would resulted into formation of a hetrojunction at the interface. FTIR studies have shown that an interfacial chemical interaction exists between carbon of GO/rGO in catalyst-2 & 3 and sulphur of CdS. Such an interaction was largely nonexistent in case of catalyst-4 prepared by hydrothermal technique. 3.2.5 Diffuse reflectance studies The diffuse reflectance spectra of all the catalysts are shown in Fig. 10 . It is observed that for catalyst-1 there is a sharp increase in the absorbance starting at ∼540nm. Such a sharp increase in absorbance indicates onset of band gap excitation. However, such a sharp rise is not observed in catalysts-2, 3 and 4. These catalysts were CdS supported on GO or rGO. It is also observed that GO and rGO supported catalysts had a rather continuous absorption in the range of visible light. This effect was more pronounced in catalyst-3. As reported in the literature [48,63,64] such enhancement could be due to greater surface electric charge on the CdS due to the presence of GO/rGO. The direct band gap was also calculated by plotting (αhν)2 vs hν, where α is the absorbance. The intercept on the x-axis yielded the value of band gap. It was difficult to estimate the bandgap accurately owing to the continuous increase in absorbance in GO & rGO supported catalysts (catalyst-2, 3 and 4). The calculated values of band gaps were 2.48, 2.32 2.18 and 2.22eV for the catalyst 1–4, respectively. It is seen that incorporation of GO or rGO has resulted into narrowing of bandgap. Narrowing of bandgap has been also observed by many earlier workers [20,65]. They have attributed such narrowing of bandgap to the interfacial interaction of CdS with GO/rGO. Lee et al., [66] have reported that chemical bonding between semiconductor and GO/rGO can introduce a localized state within the bandgap of the semiconductor causing bandgap narrowing or analogously, a red shift in the absorption edge as shown in Fig. 11 . It is observed that both the phenomenon i.e., the narrowing the bandgap and enhanced absorption were more pronounced in catalyst-3. It should also be mentioned that catalyst-4 prepared by hydrothermal technique, a method mostly reported in the literature by many workers showed inferior absorption as well as negligible narrowing of band gap compared to the catalyst-3. It is order to mention that photoluminescence studies also indicated significantly lower recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Therefore, it may be concluded that because of a higher absorption and a greater interfacial interaction between CdS and rGO observed in catalyst-3 prevented the charge recombination and made a larger number of electrons available for the reaction. 3.2.6 XPS studies X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out for surface characterization of samples. The C1s peaks are shown in Fig. 12 . The peaks were de-convoluted using Lorenutzian Gaussian fitting [67]. It is clearly seen that carbon atoms are associated with different oxygen functional groups. The 284.6eV peak is assigned for the carbon in the non-oxygenated ring, CC bonds; at 286.4eV peak is due to hydroxyl and epoxy, the 287.5eV peak is due to CO bond related to carbonyl and 288.7eV for OCOH bond related to carboxyl [68,69]. Xu at al. [70] have reported that the peak at 285.6eV can also be due to CS bond. However, to overlapping peaks the CS peak could not be uniquely identified from the C1s peak. The relative intensity of CC peak (284.6eV) with respect to all other carbon peaks taken together was calculated and shown in Table 4 . It is simply the ratio of peaks height of CC peak to the summation of all peak heights. It is seen that the ratio is more in rGO compared to GO indicating that the process adopted for reduction of GO to rGO has been successful. It is further observed that incorporation of CdS on GO/rGO has further improved this ratio. It means that during the process of catalyst preparation, a few more oxygen containing functional groups have been removed. The FTIR studies as reported earlier, have also led to the same observation. It is further seen from Table 4 that the relative intensity of CC peak ratio is highest for catalyst-3 which was CdS supported on rGO and was prepared by gas-solid reaction. The literature reports that higher the intensity of CC peak more will be the electronic conductivity [71,72]. A higher electronic conductivity is also a requirement for better change separation and subsequently superior photocatalytic activity. In addition, it is also observed that catalyst-4, the C 1s peak intensity for OCOH bond (Fig. 12E) related to carboxyl has much higher intensity. It may be due to hydrothermal treatment during preparation process of photocatalyst. In Fig. 13 , the XPS spectrum of Cd2+ for all catalysts showed doublet with binding energies at ∼405.3 and ∼412.3eV. These values largely match with the values reported in the literature for Cd2+, i.e., 405.1 & 412.1eV for Cdd5/2 and Cdd3/2 respectively [73–75]. XPS spectra of S 2p peaks are shown in Fig. 14 . Both the original and deconvoluted peaks are shown. Catalyst-1 (unsupported CdS) and catalyst-4 (prepared by hydrothermal technique) had a single doublet. Whereas catalyst-2 and 3 which were GO and rGO supported CdS and prepared by impregnation followed by gas-solid reaction had two well resolved doublets. The peak positions (binding energy) have been reported in Table 5 . The binding energy of elemental sulphur is 164.3eV [76]. The literature [77,78] also reports BE of 163.8eV for CS species and 163.8eV for CSC type sulphur. Accordingly the second doublet 2p3/2∼164.0eV observed in catalyst-2 and 3 has been ascribed to formation of CS type bond as a result of sulphur doping. Sulphur doping might be due to treatment of GO/rGO with H2S gas at high temperature. It is in order to mention that FTIR studies had also indicated presence of carbon-sulphur bond in these two samples. The BE of 2p3/2 peaks of the first doublet show significant variation. The first doublet has been assigned to S2− of CdS. For unsupported CdS (catalyst-1) the BE of 2p3/2 is 161.3eV [79]. The BEs become more positive for GO/rGO supported CdS. Such a shift in BE is conclusive evidence of interfacial chemical interaction between CdS and GO/rGO through π* orbital of GO/rGO and n orbital of S or CdS. Due to this chemical interaction, the net charge on sulphur ion become less as compared to that of sulphur ion in unsupported CdS and therefore a positive shift in BE are observed. Further observation shows that such a shift has taken place to a greater extent in catalyst-3 which also showed the highest activity. This is in line the accepted mechanism that a greater chemical interaction at the interface would promote an efficient separation of charges. It is also to be mentioned that CdS prepared by impregnation followed by high temperature reaction has n-type semiconductivity whereas GO/rGO has p-type semiconductivity, therefore, chemical interaction at the interface as reported above will result into formation of p-n hetrojunction in catalyst-2 and 3. However, catalyst-3 had a higher activity compared to catalyst-2 because catalyst-3 was rGO supported which has an additional attribute of high electron mobility. Therefore, high activity of catalyst-3 is as a result of high electron conductivity of support rGO and chemical interaction at the interface leading to formation of p-n hetrojunction. 3.2.7 Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) studies Although the temperature-programmed oxidation technique has been carried out to study metal support interaction as reported in the literature [80,81], we carried out TPO of CdS supported GO/rGO to understand their interaction. The results are shown in Figs. 15 and 16 . It is observed that for unsupported CdS, the peaks in the profile appear at 955K and 1010K and for rGO/GO peaks were observed at 840K and 940K [Fig. 15]. The TPO profiles of catalyst-2, 3 and 4 had a total four peaks [Fig. 16]. On comparison with CdS the peaks appearing at temperature ∼940K and ∼1000K may be assigned to oxidation of CdS, whereas peaks appearing at ∼840K and ∼930K to the oxidation of GO/rGO. Though the TPO profiles are rather continuous and broad, still the shifts in peak position in catalyst-2, 3, and 4 may be observed, compared to CdS and GO/rGO. The shift in peak position is indicative of interaction between CdS and GO/rGO. The shift was greatest in catalyst-3 and least in catalyst-4, which was prepared by hydrothermal technique. Thus observations are in line with those of XPS as discussed above."
8,Conclusion,"CdS supported on rGO photocatalyst, for hydrogen production by dissociation of water, was prepared by impregnation of rGO by an ammonical solution of CdSO4 followed by drying and high temperature reaction with H2S gas. Activity of this catalyst was found to be superior to that of a photocatalyst of same composition prepared by commonly reported hydrothermal technique. A detailed characterization of photocatalysts was carried out to correlate microstructure and activity. The FTIR analysis showed existence of C-S bond in photocatalyst prepared by gas-solid reaction. In addition, the PL spectroscopy and the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy reveled that in photocatalyst prepared by the gas-solid reaction, there was a better charge separation and also a better absorption of light of visible range. The XRD results did not indicate any defect structure and it also showed that activity may not be directly correlated with crystallite size. The TEM showed that particles in catalysts were not agglomerated. The XRD results which was supported by electron diffraction results, showed existence of only hexagonal phase of CdS in catalyst prepared by the gas-solid reaction. However less active cubic phase of CdS was also observed in the catalyst prepared by hydrothermal technique. The XPS analysis revealed doping of sulphur in GO/rGO in catalyst prepared by gas-solid reaction. The analysis of S 2p peaks of XPS further revealed that chemical interaction has taken between CdS and GO/rGO in all the catalysts but such an interaction was highest in catalyst prepared adopting gas-solid reaction. It is concluded that chemical interaction is due to electronic transition between π* orbital of C and n orbital of S in CdS. It is further concluded that since CdS prepared at high temperature by the gas-solid reaction exhibits n-type semiconductivity and the fact that rGO is a p-type semiconductor, the synergy at the interface had promoted formation of p-n hetrojunction. This along with high electron mobility exhibited by rGO has resulted into high activity of the reported photocatalyst prepared by impregnation followed by gas-solid reaction."
