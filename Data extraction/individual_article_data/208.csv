0,Introduction,"Natural fats are converted into biodiesel in typical process of methanolysis. This process seems now more attractive because of a growing interest in an ecological diesel fuel. However, due to the higher raw material cost, biodiesel is difficult to compete with petroleum diesel. Therefore, new method must be found to enlarge the value of biodiesel. Fatty alcohol, produced by the hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester, is an important chemical raw material and widely used in the fields of detergents, plasticizers, synthetic fibers, surfactants and cosmetics (Bryan, 2009; Krzysztof et al., 2003). At present, the hydrogenation popularly uses supported ruthenium and rhodium (Miyake et al., 2009), copper chromite (Deepak et al., 1999), palladium (Agustı’n et al., 2006), zinc, ferrum and thulium oxide catalysts (Buchold, 1983). The drawbacks of these processes are much more catalyst requirements, higher reaction temperature and higher hydrogen pressure, especially, inactivation of catalyst. Therefore, to design and synthesize a catalytic system which is stable, easily separable and reusable has been pursued. Based on the property of cloud point of nonionic P-ligands, a novel aqueous biphasic homogeneous catalysis system termed as thermoregulated phase-transfer catalysis (TRPTC) was proposed in recent years (Jiang et al., 2002; Jin et al., 1997; Kevin, 2009; Jin and Wang, 2005). The introduction of TRPTC is free from the shortcomings of classical biphasic catalysis, in which the scope of application is restrained by the water-solubility of the substrate. The character of this catalytic process can be described as follows: At a temperature lower than cloud point (CPT), the catalyst would remain in the aqueous phase. On heating to a temperature higher than CPT, the catalyst would transfer into the organic phase. Thus, the catalyst and the reagents are in the same phase and the reaction is carried out in the organic phase. As soon as the reaction is completed and the system is cooled to a temperature lower than CPT, the catalyst would return to the aqueous phase. Therefore, TRPTC is a monophasic reaction combined with a biphasic separation, which contributes to the separation and reusability of the catalyst, and it has been successfully used in the hydrogenation of high-carbon olefins with excellent conversion and selectivity (Jiang et al., 1999; Wei et al., 2004). However, the reported hydrogenations mainly use linear olefins with little steric hindrance as reagents, no literature about the hydrogenation of carboxylic ester in presence of TRPTC was found. Here we first report the hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester in presence of TRPTC. It is found that TRPTC was an efficient catalyst for the hydrogenation. The mixture of product higher alcohol and unreacted ester was easily separated from the ionic liquid by decantation, and the desired product higher alcohol was easily separated from the unreacted ester which could be used as biodiesel by distillation."
1,Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetrahydrofuran, triethylamine and catechol were distilled over calcium hydride or 3A molecular sieve under reduced pressure, and poly(ethylene glycol) alkyl ethers were dehydrated by 3A molecular sieve before use. Fatty acid methyl ester was prepared from soybean oil by transesterification with methanol at 65°C for 4h using 0.2 wt% sodium hydroxide as catalyst. (Saponification value 188mg KOH/g, acid number 5 mg KOH/g, value of iodine (I·V) 135mg I2/g, hydroxyl value (OH·V) 1mg KOH/g). Other chemicals used were reagent grade procured commercially and used without pretreatment."
3,Preparation of P-ligands,"2.2 Preparation of P-ligands The P-ligands I–IV (Fig. 1 ) were synthesized according to the literatures (Jiang et al., 1999; Wei et al., 2004). For example, the general process for the preparation of P-ligand I is following: Under nitrogen, 0.15mol phosphorus trichloride was mixed with 0.1mol catechol under 20°C with an ice bath and reacted for 30min at room temperature, then another 0.1mol phosphorus trichloride was added and further reacted for 2h at 80°C. After that, the mixture was distilled to remove the unreacted phosphorus trichloride at 80°C under reduced pressure (70–90mm Hg), giving 1,2-phenylene phosphorochloridite with 82.5% yield. Next, 0.01mol 1,2-phenylene phosphorochloridite was dissolved in the mixture of tetrahydrofuran and triethylamine (V/V=3), and 0.075mol fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene (RO-(CH2CH2O) n -H) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. Both was mixed and reacted at 5°C for 6h, then further reacted at room temperature for 12h. The mixture was filtrated to remove ammonium salt, and distilled to remove the solvents. 100ml anhydrous ethyl ether was added to the residue and filtrated to get the white precipitate, giving P-ligand I with 92% yield (Fig. 2 ). The cloud points were measured according to the literature (Jiang et al., 1999). I: IR (KBr disc, cm−1): ν 2923, 2860, 1600, 1498, 1467, 1108, 1032, 953, 749. 1H NMR (500MHz, D2O, ppm): 0–1.50(m, C15H21–C20H41), 3.0–4.0(s, OCH2), 6.7–7.2(m, Ar–H). 31P NMR (200MHz, D2O, ppm, external standardization: 85% H3PO4): 7.40(s). Cloud points: 103°C.

4,Hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester,"2.3 Hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester The mixture of 2.5g fatty acid methyl ester, 3mg metal chloride, 1g ligand, 2.5g water and 2.5g toluene was reacted in a 100ml stainless-steel autoclave with 7MPa H2 at 200°C for 4h. After that, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and depressurized. The upper organic phase was separated from the aqueous phase by decantation and distilled under reduced pressure to obtain the product higher alcohol. The OH·V and I·V of the product were measured according to the literature (Wang, 1993). All results were repeated at least five times (10 times for Pd/IV)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of different catalysts on hydrogenation results,"3.1 Effect of different catalysts on hydrogenation results As can be seen from Table 1 , some examined thermoregulated phase-transfer catalysts exhibited better catalytic performance than traditional catalysts Pd/C and PdCl2. This may be due to that, at the reaction temperature, the catalyst is soluble in organic phase, and the reaction proceeds homogeneously, while Pd/C and PdCl2 are used as catalysts, the reaction is carried out in the solid–liquid two-phase system (Wang et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 1999). It was indicated that the hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester could be smoothly carried out in presence of thermoregulated phase-transfer catalysts. Among the investigated thermoregulated phase-transfer catalysts, Pd/IV showed the best catalytic performance with 160 OH·V and 0 I·V (theoretical hydroxyl value 203mg KOH/g, which was calculated according to the reference Wang, 1993), but the results of others were not satisfied. This may be because of the steric resistance of P-ligand. With increasing the volume/size of the substituent group of the P-ligand, the steric resistance of the catalyst complex was higher, which handicaps the progress of hydrogenation reaction."
7,Effect of metal complex on hydrogenation results,"3.2 Effect of metal complex on hydrogenation results As shown in Table 2 , the TRPTC Pd/IV exhibited efficient catalytic performances for hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester, but the others were poor. Especially using Ni/IV as catalyst, OH·V and I·V were only 5 and 106, respectively, which indicated that the hydrogenation was almost no occurred. This may be because of the differently catalytic activity of the metal complexes, and this result is in line with that reported in literature (Szollosi et al., 1996)."
8,Reusability of Pd/IV,"3.3 Reusability of Pd/IV When the reaction was finished, the upper organic phase was separated from aqueous phase by decantation. Then by adding fresh solvent and reagent, the aqueous phase was directly used as catalyst and the reusability of the catalytic system was investigated under optimum reaction conditions, the results were given in Table 3 . The results showed that the catalytic system was reused five times without an obvious decrease in its catalytic activity. Therefore, it was indicated that this catalyst system was of good reusability. The good reusability of this catalytic system was attributed to the good thermally stable and effective phase-transfer performance, which could well avoid the loss of catalyst during the reaction and separation."
9,Conclusion,"The hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester was investigated in presence of thermoregulated phase-transfer catalysts. The thermoregulated catalytic system Pd/IV exhibited an efficient catalytic performance. Using Pd/IV as catalyst, not only the hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl ester was of high selectivity to saturated fatty alcohol, but also the product could be easily separated from the catalytic system and the catalyst complex was of good reusability. It is also found that the steric resistance of the nonionic P-ligand, to a large extent, affects the performance of metal complex. Thus, more research should be done to synthesize novel nonionic phosphine ligands with little steric resistance in order to extend the field of the thermoregulated catalytic system."
