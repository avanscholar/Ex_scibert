0,Introduction,"The building blocks of most of the commodity chemicals, polymers, and materials are derived from fossil-based feedstocks. These non-renewable resources are not persistent and slowly exhausting due to overexploitation. With the growing concern for the dependence on fossil resources and environmental issues for extensive utilization of these feedstocks, scientists are searching for alternative raw materials to produce these fine chemicals. For this purpose, biomass is one of the attractive complementary renewable raw materials [1,2]. Recently, considerable progress has been achieved via both thermochemical and biochemical routes for converting biomass to small molecules such as alcohols and diols [3–5]. Hence, effective utilization of these alcohols and diols for the synthesis of bulk chemicals and other value-added products will be an environmentally benign synthetic approach. In the last two decades, substantial developments have been achieved in transition metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols and related chemistry [6–14]. Dehydrogenation of alcohol is a highly effective strategy to synthesize carbonyl compounds and their derivatives. This bona fide protocol is benefitted with the formation of various CC and CX (X = heteroatom) bonds via dehydrogenative coupling reactions and generation of hydrogen and water as the sole by-products, making this procedure more environmentally benign and sustainable from the green chemistry perspective. Depending on whether the released hydrogen is consumed in the reaction or not, dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols are divided into two categories; acceptorless-dehydrogenative-coupling (ADC), where hydrogen molecule is liberated from the reaction medium without the requirement of any acceptor, and borrowing-hydrogen methodology (BH) where the released hydrogen is accepted by an intermediate generated in the reaction process. Despite the widespread applicability of this strategy, dehydrogenation of alcohols and related reactions were mainly explored using precious metal-based catalysts. For the last few decades, replacement of these expensive metals with more economical 3d metals are gaining attention, mainly due to their cost-effectiveness and profuse availability on earth surface [15–29]. Thus, the amalgamation of earth-abundant 3d metal catalysis with dehydrogenative functionalization of alcohols is highly fascinating for the development of a more sustainable methodology to conserve the precious metals as well as the fossil-based resources. Cobalt-catalyzed reactions have received relentless attention due to its lower toxicity and lesser expenses than other transition metals, which led to several remarkable and exciting breakthroughs and generated a new chemical space in the field of catalysis [30–35]. Cobalt complexes can exhibit variety of oxidation states (+3, +2, +1, 0, and −1) and both one- and two-electron redox processes are common [36]. Moreover, compared to other transition metals, it shows exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity with diverse mechanisms because of the different coordination geometry, unique redox chemistry (multiple oxidation and spin state), and substitutional lability. Thus, cobalt complex catalyzed alcohol dehydrogenation and related transformations are now widely recognized as an exciting area of research (see Scheme 1 ). Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have their own merits and demerits. The absolute target in catalysis is to accomplish the ultimate synthesis concerning the catalytic reactivity and selectivity towards specific product, atom economy as well as step-efficacy. Amongst these two methodologies, homogeneous catalysis can offer benefits including milder reaction conditions, higher catalytic activity, higher yield of product, and scope for detailed mechanistic investigations. On the contrary, reaction with heterogeneous catalysts provide easier separation of products, recyclability of the catalyst as well as accessibility of different active sites on the same solid support with different functions, by cooperatively or separately in different steps. In this review we highlighted the advancement that has been made in alcohol dehydrogenation and related chemistry using both homogeneous and heterogeneous cobalt-based catalysts."
1,Homogeneous cobalt catalysts in alcohol dehydrogenation and functionalization,
2,Acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols,"2.1 Acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols Synthesis of carbonyl compounds via oxidation of alcohols is an elementary reaction with a wide range of applications. Compared to the traditional methods of using oxidants such as metal oxides, pressurized oxygen, perchlorates, hypervalent iodine, peroxides, etc., catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation is a promising strategy to synthesize carbonyl compounds [37–40]. Additionally, as hydrogen gas is the sole by-product in this process, this approach is a potential alternative for future hydrogen energy storage and carrier [41–43]. Although, several transition metal-based systems have been investigated and highlighted for dehydrogenation of alcohols, cobalt-catalyzed similar transformations are not properly showcased. In 2012, Hanson group described an efficient hydrogenation of various unsaturated molecules such as carbonyls, olefins, and imines with a homogeneous pincer cobalt complex [(PNHPCy)Co(CH2SiMe3)]BArF 4 [44]. Based on the microscopic reversibility principle, in 2013, the authors tested the potential of the same catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alcohols (Scheme 2 ) [45]. Following the optimized reaction conditions several benzylic and aliphatic secondary alcohols generated the resultant ketones in high yields. However, this catalyst showed a lesser reactivity for the dehydrogenation of primary alcohols. They further utilized this protocol for the synthesis of imines by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with amines. Kinetic studies and control experiments indicated the reversibility in the alcohol dehydrogenation process and the participation of a [LCo(II)-H] as the active catalyst. After that, they carried out a thorough mechanistic investigation for the similar cobalt-catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions [46]. To study the role played by the NH group of the ligand in Co-1 complex towards the dehydrogenation of alcohol via metal–ligand co-operation (MLC), the N-methylated Co-3 was synthesized, as shown in Scheme 3 . Notably, Co-3 displayed slightly better reactivity for the dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol (95% yield of acetophenone) compared to Co-1 (90% yields). This result suggested that MLC was not involved in this transformation. When Co-1 was reacted with 1-phenylethanol, formation of new diamagnetic cobalt complex (Co-2) was observed, which was further supported by spectroscopic data and elemental analysis. Independently synthesized Co-2 complex showed similar reactivity for the dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol which implied that Co-2 could be the possible resting state of Co-1 for acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol. The authors proposed that the starting Co(II) complex, Co-1 was reduced to a Co(I) species by 1-phenylethanol with the generation of acetophenone and tetramethyl silane. Next, by the dehydrogenation of a second molecule of 1-phenylethanol and followed by the CH bond activation of the produced acetophenone, the Co(I) species produced Co-2. Based on the experiments, the authors proposed a possible catalytic pathway starting from the Co-2 complex, entailing Co(I)/(III) redox cycle for the dehydrogenation of alcohol (Scheme 3). First by the reductive elimination of acetophenone, Co-2 produced a Co(I) intermediate and by oxidative addition of the OH bond of 1-phenylethanol to the Co(I) center a Co(III)-alkoxy species was generated. Next a β-hydride elimination and finally reductive elimination of hydrogen completed the cycle. In 2015, Yang and co-workers carried out a detailed DFT calculation for the similar cobalt pincer complex catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohol, which also supported the mechanism proposed by Hanson’s group (Scheme 4 ) [47]. In this report, the authors compared the energy barrier for the dehydrogenation of alcohol with three (PNP)cobalt complexes with varying substituents on N-atom (Co-1, Co-3, and Co-4). For this catalytic cycle, the DFT studies disclosed that the oxidative addition of alcohol OH bond to the Co(I) species was the rate-determining step. They further disclosed that although Co-4 exhibited a lower energy barrier compared to Co-1 or Co-3, it was inactive towards alcohol dehydrogenation reaction. Due to the absence of an additional substituent/hydrogen on the nitrogen atom, Co-4 was highly reactive towards the capture of hydride on the Co-center, which led to the generation of a catalytically inactive species (Co-5). Although there were few reports known for dehydrogenation of alcohols using cobalt-based catalytic systems, however, most of them were effective only for secondary alcohols. In 2016, the same group carried out a similar density functional theory calculation specifically for ethanol dehydrogenation by the (PNP) pincer cobalt complexes Co-6 and Co-7 (Scheme 5 ) [48]. Authors found that total free energy of dehydrogenation of ethanol for Co-6 was lower than that for Co-7, which indicated the capability of Co-6 complex for dehydrogenation of primary alcohols including ethanol under mild conditions. The authors proposed two probable pathways for the liberation of H2 to regenerate the catalyst (1); one is direct proton transfer (4 to 5), and the other one is ethanol-assisted proton transfer (4 to 5 via 6, 7, and 8). They studied the energies for those paths and proposed that the reaction proceeded favorably through a self-promoted mechanism, where an extra ethanol facilitated the proton transfer to eliminate H2. Interestingly, the dehydrogenation reaction was shown to be crucially affected by the nitrogen in the PNP ligand. Ding group in 2018 synthesized a cobalt catalyst (Co-8) bearing a tetradentate tripodal ligand. They hypothesized that due to the different coordination sites showed by the tetradentate ligand it might stabilize the highly reactive intermediates and can exhibit distinct activity compared to systems bearing tridentate ligand [49]. This Co-8 complex effectively dehydrogenated secondary alcohols to ketones (Scheme 6 ). Notably, under the standard reaction condition, benzyl alcohol instead of affording benzaldehyde, produced benzyl benzoate probably via dehydrogenative alcohol homocoupling. Next, Sundararaju group described dehydrogenation of secondary alcohols using a cobalt catalyst bearing air-stable phosphine-free ligand system (Scheme 6) [50]. A wide range of secondary alcohols efficiently furnished the desired ketones. A simple comparison of the various reported cobalt catalysts for the dehydrogenation of a common substrate 1-phenylethanol is listed in the Table 1 . Recently, Gunanathan group disclosed an (NNN)Co(II) complex mediated dehydrogenative transformation of alcohols to their corresponding carboxylate salts (Scheme 7 ) [51]. A series of alcohols were transformed to their resultant acid products with good functional group tolerance under the catalytic condition. Additionally, with this catalyst system they carried out the dehydrogenation of ethanol to potassium acetate, and diols to dicarboxylic acids. The authors performed several mechanistic investigations which suggested that the reaction proceeded via Cannizzaro-type reaction and KOH was the supplier of the second oxygen atom in the produced carboxylate salts."
3,Transfer hydrogenation,"2.2 Transfer hydrogenation Transfer hydrogenation (TH) reactions catalyzed by the transition metals is a simple, convenient, and potential strategy to produce innumerable hydrogenated compounds, especially by reduction of polar unsaturated group such as carbonyl and imine [52–54]. With the increase in environmental concern, TH reactions have become a hot topic of research as TH methods involve cheaper, readily available and easy to handle hydride sources and not hazardous pressurized H2 gas or other strong reducing agents [52]. For the proficient synthesis of several essential molecules such as alcohols, amines, etc., various efficient Ir, Ru, and Rh based catalytic systems have been reported for the transfer hydrogenation reactions [54–56]. Although, the development of catalytic systems with inexpensive, earth abundant metals are always preferable over expensive precious metals, however, due to their lower reactivity first-row transition metals-based catalysts are relatively underutilized in transfer hydrogenation reactions. A general scheme for the transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds with alcohol is shown in Scheme 8 . In 2013, Hanson group tested their Co-1 catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation of a diverse range of CO and CN bonds containing substrates such as aldehydes, ketones, α, β-unsaturated carbonyls, and imines (Scheme 9 ) [57]. Interestingly, for α, β-unsaturated carbonyls like 3-phenylprop-2-enal or trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one both CO and CC bonds were hydrogenated with the reported catalyst system. Mechanistic investigations showed the involvement of a cobalt monohydride in this transfer hydrogenation reaction. Authors observed that metal–ligand cooperativity did not play any significant role in this catalytic transformation. Further, in 2015, Ke and Zhao group carried out a detail theoretical study on the transfer hydrogenation of ketones by (PNP)Co(II) systems (Scheme 10 ) [58]. Authors reported that the reaction followed an inner-sphere non-bifunctional path owing to a high energy of deformation for the complex triggered by variation in the ligand field in the outer-sphere bifunctional way, which was in support of the experimental observation reported by Hanson et al. Realizing the potential of this Co-1 complex in the hydrogenation of non-polar CC bond, Zhang group, in 2016, showed the first homogeneous cobalt system for the transfer hydrogenation of olefins using isopropanol (Scheme 11 ) [59]. Various substituted styrene substrates were smoothly hydrogenated under the reported protocol. However, moderate reactivity was observed for bulkier internal alkenes such as trans- and cis-stilbenes which required longer reaction time. Afterwards, various groups demonstrated the utilization of isopropanol as hydrogen source for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones with different cobalt catalysts. In 2020, Bala and co-worker introduced an (NHC)Co(III) complex (Co-11) for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones using isopropanol (Scheme 12 ) [60]. Various substituted ketones were effectively transfer hydrogenated under the optimized reaction conditions. The authors observed a TON up to 490 with TOF up to 1635 h−1 for transfer hydrogenation of 1-phenylpropanone. In presence of higher amount of catalyst loading the yield of the product was decreased due to the agglomeration of the complex in the solution. Based on previous reports and experimental evidence the author proposed a mechanism for the catalytic transformation. In the same year, Yang et al. introduced a pincer (NHC)Co(II) complex for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones (Scheme 12) [61]. A broad range of ketones were efficiently converted to the desired hydrogenated products with good functional group tolerance. Chiral alcohols have wide utilization in pharmaceutical, fragrance, and agrochemical industries [3,62]. But the synthesis of optically active molecules following the alcohol dehydrogenation strategy is explored mostly with precious metals. In 2020, Zuo group reported a Co(II)-complex for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones under mild condition (Scheme 12) [63]. This catalyst offered a maximum enantiomeric excess (ee) value of up to 91% and TON up to 555 under a mild reaction condition. A wide range of substrates showed satisfactory yield of the desired transfer hydrogenated product with moderate to good enantioselectivity. Comparison of various cobalt complexes reported in the literature for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones using isopropanol as the hydrogen source is presented below in Table 2 ."
4,Carbon-carbon bond formation,"2.3 Carbon-carbon bond formation The borrowing hydrogen (BH) protocol offers a sustainable technique for the creation of several CC bonds utilizing alcohols Scheme 13 [64,65]. This reaction is originated by a metal catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohol to produce the carbonyl compounds and a metal hydride. Next, an aldol condensation reaction between the carbonyl compounds under basic conditions forms an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl species. This α, β-unsaturated carbonyl intermediate subsequently gets hydrogenated by the metal hydride to furnish the C-alkylated product. Although primary developments of borrowing hydrogen methodology were arbitrated mostly by noble metal (Ru, Rh, Ir, etc.) based catalysts; recently several exciting results were emerged using 1st row transition metal-based systems [10]. Here in this part, we will discuss cobalt catalysts reported for CC bond forming reactions using alcohols following the BH strategy. 2.3.1 C-alkylation of alcohols Conventional synthesis of alkylated ketones or alcohols is a multistep process and requires toxic oxidizing reagents and alkyl halides which generate ample wastes. Thus, it would be highly needed to develop environment friendly and atom efficient alternative approaches using less toxic and abundant substrates; and alcohol is a promising candidate in this prospect. Thus, C-alkylation of alcohols following alcohol dehydrogenation strategy is considered as a protuberant synthetic methodology owing to its significant advantages over the traditional methods [64]. In 2017, Kempe group reported cobalt-catalyzed synthesis of β-alkylated alcohols via cross-coupling of secondary and primary alcohols (Scheme 14 ) [66]. The Co-14 complex, previously utilized for the C-alkylation of amides and esters, was found to be efficient for the β-alkylation reactions to afford long chain secondary alcohols. A wide variety of alcohols including aliphatic alcohols proceeded well under this catalytic condition. In contrast to this, Ding and co-workers, in 2019, reported Co-8 complex catalyzed selective access to alkylated ketones by the cross-coupling of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols (Scheme 15 ) [67]. An admirable reactivity was observed for the dehydrogenation coupling of various alcohols. Next, a phosphine-free cobalt complex bearing NNN-pincer ligand (Co-15) was introduced by Li et al. for the similar coupling of secondary and primary alcohols to furnish α-alkylated ketones (Scheme 15) [68]. A large array of primary and secondary alcohols underwent the reaction to generate the resultant products in high yields. Authors performed several control experiments and proposed a catalytic cycle with the NH group of the ligand system playing crucial role in the (de)hydrogenation processes. 2.3.2 α-alkylation of ketones In 2017, Zhang group revealed that the cobalt complex Co-1, which was reported earlier, was equally effective for the α-alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols (Scheme 16 ) [69]. A series of ketones and alcohols were well tolerated under the catalytic condition and generated the subsequent α-alkylated ketones with high yields. Later, Sundaraju group demonstrated a similar reaction for α-alkylation of ketones with secondary alcohols employing previously reported phosphine-free Co(III) complex (Scheme 16) [70]. Dehydrogenative coupling of secondary alcohols, which is relatively challenging than that of primary alcohols were successfully demonstrated with a wide range of substrates to afford the preferred products in good to excellent yields. The authors mentioned the crucial role played by the steric effect of aryl alkyl ketones in the preclusion of self-condensation reaction to enhance the selectivity to the desired product. 2.3.3 C-alkylation of unactivated esters and amides Direct CH functionalization of unactivated esters and amides using alcohols following the BH methodology is considered as an interesting protocol due to their widespread applications in the production of numerous valuable compounds and natural products [71,72]. In 2016, Kempe group described a (PNP)Co catalyst for the C-alkylation of unactivated esters and amides with alcohols by BH methodology (Scheme 17 ) [73]. Variety of tertiary butyl group bearing esters reacted well with benzylic as well as aliphatic alcohols. A wide range of acetamides were also efficiently alkylated by modifying the catalytic condition including catalyst and base loading, solvents, temperature etc. 2.3.4 Others Although reactions following alcohol dehydrogenation strategy is well known in the literature, dehydrogenative coupling using methanol is considerably less explored particularly using 3d metal-based catalysts as methanol dehydrogenation is more challenging compared to other alcohols because of the higher dehydrogenation energy of methanol [74]. In 2017, Liu et al. reported a cobalt-based catalyst system of commercially available Co(BF4)2·6H2O and tetraphos ligand (PP3) for the efficient C-methylation of aryl ketones, aryl acetonitriles, and indoles using methanol as the methylating agent (Scheme 18 ) [75]. Deuterium labelling experiments concurred methanol as the source of methyl group and detection of formaldehyde suggested that reaction followed by dehydrogenation of methanol. Based on several mechanistic investigations authors suggested a catalytic cycle for these transformations as shown in Scheme 18. In 2019, Kundu group established an (NNN)Co(II) complex mediated C-alkylation of 2-methyl N-heteroarenes employing alcohols (Scheme 19 ) [76]. Utilizing this CC bond formation strategy several 2-methyl N-heteroarenes were efficiently alkylated at the methyl position. Authors performed various control experiments and kinetic studies to investigate the underlying mechanism of the protocol which suggested that (NNN)Co(I) complex was the possible active catalyst. Recently, Sundararaju group reported C-alkylation of several carbonucleophiles with secondary alcohols using a Co(III) complex as shown in Scheme 20 [77]. Broad range of secondary alcohols such as aryl, cyclic, as well as aliphatic alcohols reacted well under the catalytic condition for the formation of the selective C-alkylated oxindoles, benzyl cyanides and N,N-dimethyl barbituric acid. Very recently, Ding group described α-alkylation of nitriles with primary alcohols using a previously designed cobalt complex (Co-8) [78]. A wide array of substrates with various substituents reacted well to give the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (Scheme 21 ). The authors performed numbers of control experiments and surprisingly, they found that the transfer hydrogenation of 2,3-diphenylacrylonitrile using benzyl alcohol (2 equiv.) and KOH (20 mol%) with or without Co-8/KHBEt3 provided 99% yield of the desired product. Based on this information authors proposed a base promoted MPV type hydrogenation pathway for the formation of the α-alkylated nitriles."
5,Carbon heteroatom bond formation,"2.4 Carbon heteroatom bond formation In this section, we emphasized cobalt-catalyzed carbon-heteroatom bond formation reactions utilizing alcohol dehydrogenative coupling strategy. 2.4.1 N-alkylation of amines Conventional methods of alkylation of primary amines using alkyl halides or sulfonates and reductive amination suffer numerous pitfalls, including the requirement of stoichiometric amount of poisonous chemicals or hydrogen sources and production of excess salt waste [79–82]. Recently, selective mono-, or di-alkylation of amines employing alcohols as a greener and sustainable alkylating partner via borrowing hydrogen protocol has drawn considerable attention (Scheme 22 ) [83]. Homogeneous (PNP)Co(II) complex catalyzed N-alkylation of arylamines via BH methodology was first reported by Kempe group in 2015 (Scheme 23 ) [84]. A comprehensive array of substrates were alkylated effectively with high yields under relatively milder reaction condition. Notably, unsymmetrically substituted secondary diamines derivatives were synthesized by successive N-alkylation of 1,3-diaminobenzene using two different alcohols. In 2016, Zhang group described selective synthesis of N-alkylated amines utilizing a previously developed (PNP)Co(II) complex without any base and in the presence of 4 Å molecular sieves (Scheme 24 ) [85]. A series of amine and alcohol substrates responded well under this catalytic protocol including substrates like challenging aliphatic alcohols and amines. In the same year, Kirchner et al. demonstrated similar N-alkylation reaction using another Co(II) complex bearing PNP-pincer ligand (Scheme 24) [86]. Remarkably, a wide range of alcohols such as ethanol, n-butanol, cinnamyl alcohol and (R)-citronellol reacted well under the catalytic condition and afforded the corresponding N-alkylated amines in good yields. Authors tested the same reaction using an analogous cobalt-complex bearing strongly basic CH2SiMe3 substituent which notably didn’t require any base; however, an increased temperature and molecular sieves were essential for the reaction to proceed. Shortly after, Balaraman group described similar N-alkylation reaction by using combination of simple CoCl2·6H2O and PPh3 (Scheme 25 ) [87]. Following the catalytic condition, several aromatic and aliphatic alcohols offered the respective alkylated amines smoothly. Later, Liu group demonstrated a Co(II)-based system consisted of commercially accessible Co(acac)2 and P(CH2CH2PPh2)3 ligand (PP3) for N- methylation of amines (Scheme 26 ) [88]. Variety of aryl amines, both primary and secondary, were efficiently N-methylated using methanol as both substrate and solvent. In 2018, Balaraman group described an air-stable (NNN)Co(II)-catalyzed N-alkylation of aromatic amines and diamines using alcohols (Scheme 27 ) [89]. Several aniline derivatives were monoalkylated in good yields with variety of benzylic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic alcohols. Varying the amount of alcohol and other parameters they observed different substituted products including N-alkylated and N, N- dialkylated diamines. Interestingly, when benzylic and aliphatic amines were reacted in presence of 4 Å molecular sieves, under the optimized reaction condition, instead of N- alkylated amines, imines were generated in high yields. Next in 2019, Sundararaju et al. introduced a Co(III) system of [Cp*Co(CO)I2] and PCy3 ligand for monoalkylation of primary amines with secondary alcohols (Scheme 28 ) [90]. The authors disclosed a large array of substrate which efficiently generated the resultant alkylated amine in good yields. An intramolecular N-alkylation cyclization reaction was also showcased for the synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline derivatives. Several control experiment, kinetic and computational studies were performed, based on which the author proposed a possible catalytic cycle. From the DFT calculations the role of the PCy3 was mentioned to stabilize the cobalt hydride formed during the reaction; however, the formation of the phosphine-based complex [Cp*Co(PCy3)I2] was not favorable due to steric bulk. In 2021, Gupta et al. developed few cobalt complexes with amide-based pincer ligands bearing heterocyclic moieties namely thiazole, thiazoline and benzimidazole [91]. They tested the catalytic reactivity of these complexes towards N-alkylation of amines with alcohols following the BH protocol; among which thiazole based complex 20 was found to be the most active catalyst (Scheme 29 ). Authors proposed that the heterocyclic moiety in the ligand system may create a pocket for H-bonding around the cobalt center which can boost the binding of substrates near to the metal center. They also performed various mechanistic studies to investigate the probable intermediates formed in the reaction. Docking experiment was carried out to study the binding of benzyl alcohol to Co-20 and author found that the access of the benzyl alcohol into the H-bonding pocket was facilitated by the presence of H-bonds, which was further supported by binding studies. Shortly after, Ding group reported a selective access to imine and amine with a cobalt complex Co-8 (Scheme 30 ) [92]. Coupling of a wide variety of primary alcohols with amines following the optimized reaction conditions selectively offered the resultant amines in good to excellent yields. The product selectivity depended on the amount of base utilized and on the reaction environments. With a lower amount of base in an open system imine formation was dominant, while an excess amount of base under closed condition provided the amine product. Comparison of various cobalt complexes reported in the literature for the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol is shown in Table 3 . 2.4.2 Synthesis of esters Esters are also one of the essential compounds with profuse applications in various industries such as chemical, fragrance, and flavour industries [93,94]. For their synthesis, compared to the traditional methods, acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols using abundant first row transition metal-based catalysts is considered as more attractive alternative methodology. In 2018, Ding group reported Co-8 catalyzed effective synthesis of various esters from coupling of primary alcohols (Scheme 31 ) [95]. Several functionalized alcohols provided the desired esters in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the aldehyde generated by cobalt-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohol, in presence of KO t Bu and an another alcohol via Tishchenko-type pathway converted to the desired ester. The authors observed that there was no significant role of the NH group of the ligand in metal–ligand cooperativity. 2.4.3 Synthesis of N-methylated amides Owing to their ubiquitous presence in several natural products and biologically active compounds, synthesis of N-methylated amides is highly valuable reaction in organic synthesis [96]. Hence, development of more sustainable method to achieve these N-methylated amides fragments is highly desirable since the conventional method required toxic acid chlorides and volatile MeNH2 [97,98]. In 2019, Kundu and co-workers conveyed for the first time a Co/PP3 catalyzed tandem reaction of nitriles with MeOH and water mixture to furnish N-methylated amides (Scheme 32 ) [99]. Utilizing this protocol various nitriles delivered the desired N-methylated amides efficiently. Labelling experiment with CD3OD and H2O18 revealed that methanol and water respectively were the source of the methyl group and the oxygen atom in the product. Various kinetic and control experiments suggested that (PP3)Co(I)-H species was the active intermediate and the activation of the CH bond of CH3OD was one of the vital step in this reaction. Moreover, a detailed DFT study was carried out to further support the possible mechanistic cycle."
6,Carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom multiple bond formation,"2.5 Carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom multiple bond formation Carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom multiple bond formation reactions using alcohols are one of the significant class of reactions since they provide the access to the formation of various important heterocycles. 2.5.1 Synthesis of imines The transition metal catalyzed synthesis of imines via dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with amines is an environmentally gentle procedure as it generates only hydrogen and water as the by-products. As shown in the Scheme 33 , the general pathway involves a in situ generated carbonyl intermediate by the dehydrogenation of alcohol which then reacts with the amine to give a hemiaminal, and next via dehydration produces the imine. In 2013, along with the dehydrogenation of secondary alcohols (Scheme 2), Hanson group reported (PNP)Co(II)-catalyzed synthesis of imines from amines and alcohols (Scheme 34 ) [45]. Various alcohols as well as amines with different functional groups effectively coupled under the reaction condition and the corresponding imines were isolated in high yields. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the alcohol dehydrogenation was reversible in nature and the cobalt-hydride was the active intermediate in this reaction. Next, in 2018, Balaraman group reported an (NNN)Co(II)-catalyzed synthesis of imine from acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of benzylic and aliphatic amines with alcohols in presence of 4 Å molecular sieves (Scheme 34) [89]. In 2019, Madsen et al. described synthesis of imines from alcohol and amines with an in situ generated cobalt catalyst following the ADC strategy (Scheme 34) [100]. The catalytic system was composed of CoBr2, (PNP) pincer ligand, Zn as the reducing agent for the in situ generated cobalt complex and Mg3N2 as an additive. A diverge range of substituted amines and alcohols generated the desired imines in high yields. Control experiments indicated involvement of a cobalt monohydride species in this irreversible dehydrogenation process and hydride abstraction was found to be one of the slowest steps. The authors further proposed an outer-sphere pathway for the reaction. Very recently, Ding et al. reported a selective synthesis of imines and secondary amines based on the reaction parameters including base amount and reaction atmosphere (Scheme 34) [92]. Under an open condition with a lower amount of base imine formation was dominant, while with excess amount of base in a closed condition amine was observed as the major product. 2.5.2 Synthesis of N-heterocycles N-heterocyclic motifs are the key building blocks for the construction of numerous biologically and pharmacologically important compounds, agrochemicals, and functional materials [101,102]. Owing to the remarkable applications of the N-heterocyclic compounds in medicinal and industrial chemistry, development of more efficient strategies to synthesize these compounds were always a prime focus in synthetic chemistry [103,104]. However, most of the conventional methods involve multiple-step procedures with expensive or toxic reagents. In the last few decades, with the urge for the development of sustainable synthetic methodology, several reports were coming forward for the use of ADC strategy to synthesize various N-heterocycles [13]. 2.5.2.1 Synthesis of pyrroles In 2016, Milstein group introduced the first (PNN)Co catalyst for the synthesis of various N-substituted pyrroles from diols with amines (Scheme 35 ) [105]. Several substrates varying both diols and amines including aliphatic or aromatic amines and primary or secondary diols were efficiently coupled. The Co(I) complex (Co-22), synthesized separately from Co-21, under the catalytic condition showed similar catalytic activity. Thus, authors suggested involvement of a (PNN)Co(I) complex as the active catalyst in this reaction. Coupling of diketone and amines furnished the desired product in absence of the catalyst. This result suggested that the diketone could be a possible intermediate in this transformation and the catalyst was responsible for the dehydrogenation of the diols only. In homogeneous catalysis, phosphine-based ligand systems are often found to have important roles. However, tedious multistep synthetic procedures and stability of the complexes are always a matter for reconsidering some alternatives to overcome these confines. In 2018, Balaraman and co-workers reported a dimeric (SNS)Co(II) complex for the synthesis of 1H-pyrroles starting from amino alcohols and alcohols (Scheme 36 ) [106]. Various substituted pyrrole derivatives were effectively generated under the optimized reaction condition. 2.5.2.2 Synthesis of quinolines In 2017, Zhang group used their (PNP)Co(II) catalyst Co-1 for the alkylation of ketone as mentioned in Scheme 14. In the same report, they disclosed the applicability of the catalyst system in synthesizing quinoline from the dehydrogenative cyclization of 2-aminobenzyl alcohol with various ketones (Scheme 37 ) [69]. Following the same reaction condition applied for the α-alkylation of ketones, various ketones were investigated well to generate the resultant quinolines with a moderate yield. Next, various groups reported the synthesis of quinolines via acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2-amino benzyl alcohols and secondary alcohols. In 2018, Balaraman group, along with the synthesis of 1H-pyrroles (Scheme 36), showed the synthesis of quinolines with a SNS pincer cobalt complex [106]. Various substituted 2-amino benzyl alcohols and secondary alcohols delivered the resultant product in good yields (Scheme 38 ). The authors demonstrated the applicability of the catalytic protocol for the synthesis of other heterocycles including pyridines and pyrazines. In the same year, Kundu and co-workers reported a synthesis of a Co(II) complex bearing an unsymmetrical (NNN)-pincer ligand and explored its catalytic activity towards the synthesis of quinolines (Scheme 38) [107]. A wide range of substrates offered good to excellent yield of the corresponding quinoline products. Li group in 2019, demonstrated an NNN-pincer cobalt-catalyzed dehydrogenative heterocyclization of 2-aminobenzyl alcohol for the synthesis of quinolines (Scheme 38) [68]. A wide range of 2-aminobenzyl alcohols and secondary alcohols effectively underwent the optimized reaction condition to deliver the subsequent heterocycles in good to excellent yields. 2.5.2.3 Synthesis of benzimidazole Milstein group, shortly after the report on synthesis of pyrrole derivatives in 2017, tested the same cobalt catalyst Co-18 for the synthesis of benzimidazoles by dehydrogenative coupling of aromatic diamines and alcohols under base-free conditions (Scheme 39 ) [108]. Several primary alcohols displayed excellent reactivity under the catalytic condition and furnished excellent yields of the desired products. Based on the previous reports and kinetic experiments authors proposed a possible mechanism for this transformation. Next, in 2019, Sarkar group introduced a tandem procedure for the synthesis of substituted benzimidazoles by the dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and 2-nitroanilines using commercially attainable Co(acac)2 in absence of any added ligand, as shown in Scheme 40 [109]. Control experiments revealed the important role played by the nitro group; it acted as a hydrogen acceptor in the alcohol dehydrogenation as well as in the dehydrogenative aromatization step. Author also proposed a possible catalytic cycle for this tandem conversion. 2.5.2.4 Synthesis of other N-heterocycles Kundu et al., in 2018, introduced an (NNN)Cocomplex for the synthesis of various N-heterocycles such as quinolines (Scheme 38), quinoxalines and 2-alkylaminoquinolines following the dehydrogenative functionalization of alcohols (Scheme 41 ) [107]. Diverse range of diamines and 2-nitroanilines reacted efficiently with vicinal diols to generate the functionalized quinoxalines. Additionally, utilizing this catalytic system one-pot access to 2-alkylaminoquinolines from 2-amino benzyl alcohol derivatives were also effectively executed. Recently, the same group stated a cobalt-catalyzed synthesis of quinolinazoliones by dehydrogenative coupling of aliphatic alcohols and 2-aminobenzonitriles using 20 equivalents of water (Scheme 42 ) [110]. Using this tandem protocol several aliphatic alcohols and 2-aminobenzonitriles were converted to quinazolinone derivatives efficiently with Co(NO3)2·6H2O/PP3. Author performed various control and kinetic experiments to establish the mechanism. Co(I)-H species was proposed as the active intermediate formed during this tandem reaction."
7,Heterogeneous cobalt catalysts in alcohol dehydrogenation and functionalization,"Throughout the last few decades, the development of transition metal-based heterogeneous catalysts has drawn significant attention of chemists in both academics and industries. The unique properties of heterogeneous catalysts like thermal stability, reusability, and selectivity towards the desired product have made it a suitable alternative to homogeneous catalysts [111,112]. It has been found that many parameters like particle size, texture, interactions between the metal-support, metal-substrate, and metal-solvent can play a central role in the catalytic activity of the materials [112–116]. Thus, varying the metal precursors, supports, and other conditions the properties of these materials can be fine-tuned, which might assist specific reactions. The early era of heterogeneous catalysis started with noble metals like Pd, Pt, Ru, etc. Now, substituting these precious metals with the earth-abundant 3d-transition metals like Fe, Co, Ni, etc., could be a paradigm shift towards sustainable chemistry. Among the 3d-transition metals cobalt-based heterogeneous catalysts are extensively explored, and they exhibited promising reactivity in alcohol dehydrogenation and related chemistry which we highlighted below."
8,Dehydrogenation of alcohols,"3.1 Dehydrogenation of alcohols In 1995, Uemichi and co-workers presented a heterogeneous cobalt catalyst for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone (Scheme 43 ) [117]. They synthesized a series of materials with different transition metals (e.g., Pd, Pt, Ag, Ru, Ir, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, and Cr) using activated carbon as support. Among them Co/carbon was found to be the most efficient towards dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol. In comparison to the previously reported oxide supports [118], the cobalt species were highly dispersed over the activated carbon which played a crucial role in its higher activity. The catalyst was prepared by calcination of the metal salts impregnated on activated carbon followed by reduction with H2. However, this catalytic system required a higher temperature (200 °C) for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol. Later on, Zhou group performed a comparative study on the efficiency of heterogeneous cobalt catalysts using carbon nanotubes (CNT) and activated carbon (AC) as a support for the same reaction [119]. Due to the unique structural and electronic properties, Co/CNT displayed better selectivity to cyclohexanone over Co/AC. Further investigation suggested that the introduction of potassium (K) as a promoter modified the catalyst to Co-K/CNT, which had a better catalytic reactivity than Co/CNT. In presence of the promoter, yield of cyclohexanone was increased by 11% compared to Co/CNT. Although several reports of aerobic oxidation of alcohol with heterogeneous cobalt catalysts were known in literature, oxidation of alcohols using acceptorless dehydrogenation strategy was explored mostly with noble metals (e.g., Ru, Ag, Au, etc.). In 2013, Shimizu group developed a heterogeneous cobalt-catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of secondary alcohols (Scheme 44 ) [120]. They synthesized several cobalt materials using various supports like TiO2, Al2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, SiO2, SnO2, Nb2O5, MgO and carbon. Additionally, using numerous other transition metals (Ni, Cu, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, and Au), several other heterogenous catalysts were also synthesized with TiO2 and Al2O3 supports. These synthesized materials were tested towards the dehydrogenation of cyclododecanol to cyclododecanone. Out of all the catalysts, Co/TiO2 (with 10 wt% of Co) showed higher catalytic activity. The amphoteric nature of TiO2, that acted as a carrier for the substrate, helped to enhance the catalytic activity compared to the other supports. This catalytic system was highly effective towards the dehydrogenation of both cyclic and long-chain aliphatic secondary alcohols. However, a comparatively lesser amount of product was observed for aromatic/aliphatic primary alcohols like benzyl alcohol and 1-octanol. Further, the findings on structure–activity relationship revealed the role of electron deficient surface metallic cobalt sites as the active species in this catalytic transformation. After completion of the reaction the recovered catalyst was dried and regenerated under H2 flow (20 cm3/min) at 400 °C. The reactivated catalyst was reused for three times without any significant loss in catalytic activity. Piquemal group, in 2018, studied the catalytic reactivity of a Co-NPs functionalized with carboxylate capping agent for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols under neat condition (Scheme 45 ) [121]. They synthesized two different morphological Co-NPs such as rods (Co-R) and rough spheres (Co-S) and introduced them towards catalytic dehydrogenation of various linear and cyclic alcohols. Co-R catalysts with pure hcp structures showed better catalytic activity than Co-S catalysts with fcc structures due to higher surface area of the former. Compared to primary alcohols, with secondary alcohols a higher selectivity of product formation was observed. Authors considered two probable pathways for conversion of alcohols to the carbonyl compound namely alkoxy and hydroxyalkyl route. Theoretical studies suggested that the alkoxy pathway was the more favorable one for this system. Due the magnetic property of the material, the catalyst was easier to recover and could be reused up to third cycles without substantial loss in its activity. Recently, Michel and Perret’s group tested the acceptorless dehydrogenation of 2-octanol with a number of heterogeneous cobalt catalysts (Scheme 46 ). Al2O3, ZnO, ZrO2, TiO2 and carbon-supported various heterogeneous cobalt catalysts were prepared and tested for this reaction [122]. Among them Co/TiO2 showed a better catalytic activity over the others. Further investigation revealed that Co/TiO2 P25 (contains rutile and anatase in 1:3 ratio) offered highest reactivity among all different crystallographic structures of Co/TiO2. Interestingly, a better reactivity was observed for non-hydrogen-accepting solvents like decane, diisopentyl ether and o-xylene; whereas, in hydrogen-accepting solvents like GVL and DMSO the catalyst was found to be unstable. The author proposed that the lower reactivity in hydrogen-accepting solvent might be due to the formation of solvent coordinated cobalt complex. Applicability of the protocol was extended for the dehydrogenation of 1-octanol and 1, 2-octanediol. Notably, lower yield was observed for 1-octanol whereas preferential oxidation of secondary alcohol was observed in case 1, 2-octanediol. Nevertheless, a considerable decrease in catalytic performance of the material was observed in the second run due to the leaching of active cobalt species. Later, they modified the Co-NPs by decorating with carboxylate ligands for the same transformation [123]. For the production of decorated Co-NPs, polyol method was found to be an attractive procedure [124]. A layer of carboxylate ligand which was affixed to the surface of the heterogeneous catalyst rather than any solid support helped stabilizing the catalyst. This ligand played a crucial role in NP synthesis and in directing their shapes. In this transformation thickness of the ligand layer played a key role for the efficiency of the catalyst. DFT studies suggested a powerful involvement of carboxylate ligands in this transformation, particularly through hydrogen bonding with the alcohol substrates. The recyclability of the catalyst was tested up to three times."
9,Transfer hydrogenation of ketones,"3.2 Transfer hydrogenation of ketones In 2018, Lu group developed a magnetically recoverable cobalt catalyst for transfer hydrogenation of oleic acid with isopropanol as a hydrogen source (Scheme 47 ) [125]. Several cobalt catalysts were synthesized following a precipitation method of respective cobalt salt followed by reduction in 10% H2/Ar flow at a specific temperature. Characterization studies revealed that, the resultant catalyst contained a unique composition of CoOx along with metallic cobalt. Notably, varying the reduction temperature of the material, the surface cobalt composition and hence the catalytic activity can be tuned. The catalyst Co-350 which was reduced at 350 °C for 3 h was the best catalyst among all which delivered quantitative yield of octadecanol. Interestingly, carrying out the reaction with a commercial mixtures of CoOx and Co(0) delivered trace amount of hydrogenated product, which indicated the possible existence of a symbiotic effect between Co(0) and CoOx that favored the oleic acid hydrogenation through dehydrogenation of isopropanol. The recyclability of the catalyst was tested up to ten times without any considerable change in catalytic activity."
10,Carbon-heteroatom bond forming reactions,"3.3 Carbon-heteroatom bond forming reactions 3.3.1 Reductive amination of alcohols and diols with ammonia Despite reductive amination was well explored with a series of various supported metals, application of cheap 3d metals like cobalt for this transformation is quite demanding. In 1995, Sewell and co-workers reported a comparative study on cobalt (Co/SiO2) and nickel (Ni/SiO2) catalysts supported over silica towards reductive amination of ethanol (Scheme 48 ) [126]. Among them Co/SiO2 displayed higher catalytic activity over Ni/SiO2. Authors successfully checked the viability of this protocol for the synthesis of industrially important less substituted amines such as monoethylamine (MEA) and diethylamine (DEA). Further extension of this work was carried out by synthesizing several heterogeneous cobalt catalysts with various supports [127]. It was observed that for the preparation of the catalyst, the time and the temperature of reduction of the catalyst showed a significant effect on its catalytic efficiency and product selectivity. The highest catalytic activity was observed at an optimal reduction temperature of 500 °C for 1 h. Screening of catalytic activity using supports like neutral silica, γ-Al2O3 and MgO revealed that cobalt supported on silica had the highest activity for this reaction. The lower reactivity for the other two supports corresponded to the reduction in metal surface area calculated by hydrogen chemisorption. In 1999, Baiker group demonstrated amination of 1,3-propanediol with ammonia using a heterogenous cobalt catalyst and molecular hydrogen (Scheme 49 ) [128]. Addition of iron or lanthanum to the unsupported cobalt catalyst increased the selectivity towards the formation of 1,3-diaminopropane. The best activity was observed with a combination of cobalt (95 wt%) and iron (5 wt%). Presence of a small amount of iron suppressed the transformation of active meta stable β-Co to the thermodynamically more stable α-Co. Hence, the stability of the active catalyst got increased. Interestingly, with supercritical ammonia (above 132.4 °C and 114.8 bar) the reaction became more feasible compared to liquid ammonia. Notably, under the course of reaction in flow reactor, no significant decrease in catalytic activity was observed even after ten days (Scheme 50 ) Later on, they found that the selectivity towards diamine formation was not only limited to the specific catalyst or reactants but it was also dependent on the structure of the diol [129]. Substituting the H-atoms at α-carbon by CH3 group increased the diamine selectivity by eliminating the possibility of H2O elimination to afford the allylic intermediate. To unravel the role of substrate structure (diol), the authors extended their study with 1,3-cyclohexanediol and 2,4-pentanediol in supercritical ammonia using the identical Co-Fe catalyst [130]. A comparative study revealed that the lower selectivity towards diamine from diols is attributed to the elimination of H2O which led to unwanted monofunctional molecules via α,β-unsaturated alcohols, amines or ketone intermediates. On the other hand, 1,4-dihydroxy compounds afforded high selectivity for diamine and aminol under the same condition. In 2009, Zhao et al. reported a Ni-dopped Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for synthesis of acetonitrile from ethanol (Scheme 51 ) [131]. A catalyst with composition of Co19.9Ni3.0/γ-Al2O3 showed the highest catalytic activity for this transformation. Addition of proper amount of nickel as a promoter increased the surface area as well as the dispersion of the active species on the matrix of the catalyst. The catalytic activity of this material was well maintained in the second run. In 2012, Shin group reported the reductive amination of isopropanol to monoisopropyl amine (MIPA) with Co/γ-Al2O3 in presence of ammonia and hydrogen. The Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (4–27 wt% Co) was prepared via incipient-wetness impregnation method [132]. The resultant material was tested for the amination of isopropanol in atmospheric pressure with a constant flow in a fixed bed microreactor (Scheme 52 ). Among all, Co/γ-Al2O3 with 23 wt% cobalt loading exhibited the most superior catalytic efficiency for this reaction. Author proposed the formation of cobalt aluminate in presence of γ-Al2O3 as support; that decreased the probability of complete reduction of cobalt species and hence, increased the stability of the catalyst. Diisopropyl ether and diisopropyl amine were obtained as the side products in the reaction condition. Further study on catalytic activity of Co/γ-Al2O3 revealed that with an increasing cobalt content, the size of the cobalt oxide increased. Reasonably, the cobalt particles with larger volume interacted weakly with the support and hence could be reduced more easily. The increase in surface area of reduced cobalt sites might be correlated with increase in the isopropanol conversion. Notably, presence of an excess amount of ammonia increased the selectivity towards MIPA. The catalyst was found to be equally active and stable up to hundred hour (100 h) on stream of reactants. Lately, Khodakov and Ordomsky group described the role of bismuth as a promoter for alkylation of amines over cobalt catalysts supported on alumina (Scheme 53 ) [133]. The Al2O3 supported cobalt catalysts with bismuth (0–5 wt%) were synthesized via impregnation followed by calcination and reduction at 450 °C. The potential of these prepared catalysts was screened for the synthesis of n-octylamine from n-octanol and ammonia. Authors advocated that addition of Bi to Co/Al2O3 resulted various effects on structure and performance of the catalyst like weakening of alumina-cobalt interaction, desorption of poisoning species that adsorbed on the active surface and the upsurge in selectivity by suppression of the amine self-coupling. Notably, the mobile bismuth helped in the removal of the carbon species adsorbed in the catalyst surface as the reaction was performed at temperature quite higher than the Tammann temperature of bismuth metal. Interestingly, no considerable loss in catalytic activity was observed even after three cycles. 3.3.2 Others In 2019, Liu group showed reductive N-alkylation of nitroarenes using a nanostructured cobalt system (Co-N-C/CNT@AC). The carbon nanotube was encapsulated with composites of cobalt, nitrogen and carbon and was developed in situ over the surface of the activated carbon (Scheme 54 ) [134]. The catalytically active material was obtained through successive pyrolysis of mixture of the precursors followed by reduction with H2. Nitroarenes were successfully converted to imines through reduction followed by coupling with alcohols without the requirement of any base and solvent. The presence of basic N species along with of Co-N species in Co-N-C-/CNT@AC helped the alcohol amine coupling in absence of exogenous base. With a large excess of alcohols (12 equiv.) further hydrogenation of the imine was occurred which produced the secondary amine as the major product. They further explored the protocol for a broad range of substituted nitrobenzene and alcohols containing both electron-releasing and withdrawing functional groups. The catalyst was reused after treating with ethanol followed by reduction under H2 atmosphere at 375 °C. The catalytic activity dropped slightly (5%) after recycling the material five times. In 2020, Wang et al. introduced the synthesis of a cobalt containing oval shaped porous polymeric material (Co-NCIA) using indole based diacid moiety. Authors then tested the catalytic activity of the catalyst system for synthesizing 1-benzyl-2-aryl-1H-benzoimidazoles by dehydrogenative cyclization of 1,4-diaminobenzene and benzyl alcohols in aqueous medium (Scheme 55 ) [135]. Notably, the addition of an equivalent amount of additives like AgNTf2 and KF and a catalytic amount of TBAB were found to be essential for desirable yield of the product. The author mentioned that AgNTf2 acted as an auxiliary reagent to change the neutral form of the coordination complex (Co-CIA) to cationic form which made it more efficient whereas catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) was used as a phase transfer catalyst. However, the role of KF was undiscovered for this transformation. Notably, the catalyst can be recycled up to five times. In 2017, Li group disclosed synthesis of styryl sulfides employing dehydrogenative coupling methodology on benzyl alcohols and dimethyl sulfoxide using cobalt modified nitrogen dopped carbon nanotubes (Co@NCNT) (Scheme 56 ) [136]. For this purpose, authors prepared various transitional metal based NCNT supported catalysts. Among them Co@NCNT pyrolyzed at 800 °C demonstrated the highest catalytic activity for this reaction. Interestingly, they found that rather than the convention metal center, here the Co@N-dopped carbon sites functioned as the catalytically active sites. Authors proposed that the Co-NPs acted as powerful promoter in tuning the distribution of electrons over the outer carbon sites doped with nitrogen by transferring electrons. The recyclability test of the catalyst showed that up to sixth run, the catalytic activity remained unaffected. In 2019, Schüth and Lu group reported a direct access to aromatic alcohols from ethanol with hydroxyapatite (HAP) containing cobalt catalyst system (Scheme 57 ) [137]. The selectivity of this single-bed Co-HAP catalyst for the formation of methylbenzyl alcohol was 54% with 35% conversion of ethanol at 325 °C. A dual-bed catalyst system comprising of Cu/C and Co-HAP further increased the selectivity to 71% even at a lower reaction temperature of 225 °C. With only HAP, aliphatic alcohols such as n-butanol was formed as the major product with long chain aliphatic alcohols (n-hexanol to n-dodecanol) as minor products. The authors proposed that after dehydrogenation of ethanol, acetaldehyde rapidly underwent a condensation reaction catalyzed by HAP to form the intermediate 2-butenal. In the next step 2-butenal via self-condensation produced aromatic aldehydes and which subsequently converted to the desired methylbenzyl alcohol by hydrogenation. In presence of Co(II) catalyst, the intermediate 2- butenal could also be reduced to 2-butenol. But this side reaction didn’t hamper the yield of the desired product as coupling of 2- butenal with 2-butenol produce methylbenzyl alcohol directly. The authors found that the rate of dehydrogenation of ethanol was independent of the partial pressure of H2 when the reaction was carried out over only HAP, but it demonstrated a decrease in reaction rate for Co-HAP. This result revealed that ethanol dehydrogenation occurred over Co-HAP and not over only HAP. In 2019, Corma group introduced an unsupported nanolayered cobalt-molybdenum sulphide (Co-Mo-S) for alkylation of thiols using benzyl alcohols (Scheme 58 ) [138]. Among the various materials, Co-Mo-S-0.83 (0.83 represents the Co/(Co+Mo) ratio) exhibited considerably better catalytic activity for thiol alkylation by both primary and secondary alcohols. Further extension of the protocol was carried out for thioetherification of alcohols with H2S. Kinetic studies and control experiments suggested that with increase in percentage of Co3S4, the catalytic activity of the material increased and the presence of MoS2 played a crucial role in the alcohol dehydrogenation step. However, the recyclability test of the catalyst suggested an immediate downfall in catalytic activity in second run. In 2020, Wang group demonstrated a cobalt containing coordination polymer (Co-CIA) utilizing indole based diacid moiety for the synthesis of α-alkylated ketones from the coupling of ketones or secondary alcohols with various substituted benzyl alcohols (Scheme 59 ) [135]. Interestingly, the heterogeneous material was catalytically active in water. However, an equivalent amount of additives (AgNTf2 and KF) was essential for the adequate yields of the coupling products. Authors extended their protocol to coupling of substituted 1-phenylethanol with benzyl alcohols using the borrowing hydrogen strategy. Notably, the catalyst can be reused up to five times."
11,Conclusions,"During the past decades, a substantial advancement has been observed for potential application of cobalt-based catalytic systems in the area of alcohol dehydrogenation and related reactions. Complexes bearing less toxic and abundant cobalt metal flaunted effective catalytic activity in alcohol dehydrogenation, CC, CN, CO bond formation, and other associated coupling reactions. Notably, comprehensive mechanistic investigations of these catalytic reactions have offered significant information in establishing the field of cobalt-catalyzed alcohol dehydrogenative coupling reactions. Based on the accessibility of three different possible oxidation states, cobalt-based complexes exhibited unique catalytic activities in alcohol dehydrogenation. Although a majority of the homogeneous catalytic systems have Co(I) species as the active catalyst, recently, Co(II) and Co(III) complexes are also gaining considerable attention. Most of the homogeneous Co(II) complexes explored in alcohol dehydrogenation and related chemistry are Co(II) alkyl and Co(II) halide complexes bearing phosphine-based or other pincer ligands, whereas Co(III) complexes are phosphine free and air/moisture stable. Typically, the Co(I) complexes were generated from Co(II) halide complexes in presence of a strong base and alcohol or other reducing agents. A proper mechanistic investigation and detail theoretical calculations is required which can provide enough information about the comparison of the energetics for Co(I), Co(II) and Co(III) systems towards alcohol dehydrogenation and related chemistry. This will be highly valuable to understand the reaction mechanism and to design more efficient catalysts. Although various pioneering work has been carried out in this area, cobalt-catalyzed dehydrogenative-coupling reactions are still developing. There are considerable challenges yet to be explored satisfactorily. Compared to other transition metal catalysts, the number of cobalt catalysts developed till date for BH/HA reactions are still limited. Most of these reported catalytic reactions suffer from lower activity, higher catalyst and base loading, and elevated temperature. Thus, further development of efficient ligand designing and reaction conditions to attain higher reactivity and selectivity is highly desirable. For this, a detailed study of the selectivity and reactivity patterns to differentiate the 3d-metal catalysts from their precious-metal counterparts is highly desirable. Notably, despite the recent development made towards homogeneous cobalt-catalyzed alcohol dehydrogenation related chemistry, heterogenous cobalt catalysis is still less explored in this area. Relatively fewer numbers of reactions associated with alcohol dehydrogenative coupling is known in literature with heterogeneous cobalt catalysts. The nanostructured catalysts have the advantages such as reusability, tunability towards substrate as well as product selectivity, relative ease of separation, etc. Thus, further advancement in heterogeneous cobalt catalysts for dehydrogenative coupling reactions would be an exciting way to leap forward. Cobalt-catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling with methanol or other short-chain aliphatic alcohol is less explored than the other alcohols. Designing of chiral cobalt catalyst for enantioselective synthesis might also be an appealing area in BH/HA reactions. Designing and synthesizing water-soluble cobalt complexes to carry out reactions in aqueous medium will also be highly exciting. Enantioselective synthesis of chiral compounds is highly fascinating area in synthetic chemistry. Cobalt catalyzed synthesis of chiral compounds following BH/HA strategy is rare in literature and future study on this area would be highly attractive. We are anticipating that this review will uplift researchers to work in this exciting area leading to an interesting and promising era of cobalt catalysis."
