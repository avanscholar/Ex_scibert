0,Introduction,"During the past decade, non-degradable plastic waste from petrochemical polymers has caused serious environmental pollution. The global concern caused by this issue has led to the utilization of renewable resources to develop environmentally friendly, biodegradable polymers which can undergo hydrolytic or enzymatic degradation [1]. The most attractive of these alternative materials is starch. It is naturally abundant and inexpensive and thus offers the potential for mass production. Starch can be processed as transparent film with low oxygen permeability [2]. However, starch is brittle and hydrophilic and, therefore, products made from starch have poor mechanical properties and low water resistance. Consequently, the applications of starch products are limited [3]. The structure of starch contains hydroxyl groups that enable beneficial physical or chemical modifications when starch is blended or grafted with synthetic polymers [4,5]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a biodegradable synthetic polymer with good tensile strength, flexibility, and thermal stability. It has been widely applied in fields such as medicine and food industries [6]. PVA is highly polar and water-soluble because its structure contains hydroxyl groups that can form intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding with starch and other hydrophilic polymers [7]. However, PVA is relatively expensive and its biodegradability is low due to the carbon‑carbon linkage in the backbones [8,9]. Although incorporating PVA enhances mechanical properties of products, the materials still suffer from high water vapor sensitivity and low water resistance. Therefore, starch/PVA products must be protected from moisture [3,4,7,9]. A common method of modifying properties of starch is the addition of plasticizers such as glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol, which are low molecular weight liquids with low volatility [10]. Inorganic salts such as LiCl, CaCl2, MgCl2, and AlCl3 were also reported as plasticizers that could reduce the crystallinity of starch and PVA and increase the hydrophilicity and water sorption rate of its blend films [11]. By reducing intermolecular forces between polymer chains, these chemicals improve polymer flexibility and workability and reduce glass transition temperature. Another method of improving the mechano-physical properties and compatibility of starch/PVA blends is the incorporation of crosslinking agents. Common crosslinking agents for compounds containing hydroxyl groups are dialdehydes and polycarboxylic acids such as glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, and ascorbic acid [5,10,12,13]. However, the amount of plasticizer and crosslinker needed to meet the requirements of many applications is very high (~5–30 wt%) [7,14,15]. To develop highly water resistant biodegradable cassava starch (CS)/PVA films without a plasticizer or crosslinker, the novel strategy proposed in this work uses triethylamine (TEA) as a homogeneous catalyst to increase miscibility between the two phases. TEA has been reported as a catalyst in transesterification reactions due to its suitable boiling point [16,17] and promotion of amine-crosslinking in cationic polymers [18] and non-ionic boronate ester bonds [19]. To our knowledge, there is no report on the use of TEA as an additive for starch-based blends. The enhancement of compatibility and crystallinity provided the desired physical performance and mechanical properties as the hydrophobicity, water stability, and structural integrity of the blend films were improved while biodegradability was maintained. The incorporation of CS and PVA produced a low-cost, ecologically sustainable, biodegradable material."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly(vinyl alcohol) (MW 90,000–100,000 g/mol, viscosity 29.7 MPA·S, 88% hydrolyzed) was purchased from Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. Native cassava starch was provided by the Siam Modified Starch Co., Ltd., Thailand. The starch was dried at 105 °C and stored in a desiccator before use. Triethylamine was from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received."
3,Preparation of cassava starch/poly(vinyl alcohol) films,"2.2 Preparation of cassava starch/poly(vinyl alcohol) films In separate beakers, CS and PVA were dissolved in 50 mL of water and stirred at 90 °C for 30 min. After the CS had gelatinized and the solution became clear, the two solutions were mixed to a final concentration of 5% (w/v) at 90 °C. CS/PVA blends were composed at different weight ratios of PVA from 40 wt% to 80 wt% and labeled according to their starch contents as CS60, CS50, CS40, CS30, and CS20. TEA was added dropwise in ratios from 0.0% to 2.0% (denoted T0.0, T0.5, T1.0, T1.5, and T2.0) and the solution was stirred at 90 °C for another 30 min. The clear and viscous solution was filtered through a sieve and cast on a polystyrene plate (11 cm × 16 cm), evaporated at room temperature overnight, and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The films were kept in a desiccator until used."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Chemical functionalities of the CS/PVA films were examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Bruker Tensor-27) in ATR mode over a range from 600 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 over 256 scans. The mechanical properties of the CS/PVA films were measured using a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) at a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min and a load cell of 100 N. The films were cut into strips 4 mm wide with an initial gauge length of 20 mm. The samples were conditioned at room temperature and 36% relative humidity (RH) for 7 days prior to testing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta-400) was used to study the morphology of cross-sections of CS/PVA films. The films were broken after immersion in liquid nitrogen and sputtered-coated with a thin layer of gold before characterization. The thermal behaviors and miscibility of the films were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (PerkinElmer DSC 7). The film sample was placed in an aluminum pan and heated from 20 °C to 250 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The degree of crystallinity (Xc) was calculated using Eq. (1) [20]; (1) X c = ΔH f / ΔH ° × w × 100 where ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion of CS/PVA blend film, w is the weight fraction of PVA in the blend, and ΔH° is the enthalpy of fusion of 100% crystalline PVA (141.93 J/g [21]). In a soil burial test, film samples (2 cm × 2 cm) were buried 10 cm below the surface of soil in plastic cups. After 30 days, the films were removed and the biodegradation of the films was assessed. Moisture absorption was measured by placing the dry film (2 cm × 2 cm) in a glass chamber at room temperature (27.4 °C) for 24 h. The chamber was controlled to 75%RH by a saturated sodium chloride solution. The degree of moisture absorption was calculated from the weight of the film before and after absorption using Eq. (2); (2) % Moisture absorption = W m − W o / W o × 100 where Wo and Wm were the weight of the film before and after moisture absorption, respectively. The water solubility of the films was determined by comparing the weight of the dry film (2 cm × 2 cm) before and after immersion in 10 mL of distilled water at room temperature for 24 h. The degree of solubility was calculated from Eq. (3) [5]; (3) % Water solubility = W i − W f / W i × 100 where Wi and Wf were the weight of the film before and after immersion in distilled water, respectively. The mechanical, soil burial, moisture absorption, and water solubility tests were conducted using three replicates of each condition."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure of the CS/PVA films,"3.1 Structure of the CS/PVA films The FTIR spectra of CS/PVA films at 50 wt% of CS with and without addition of TEA both show a broad band between 3560 and 2970 cm−1 and peaks at 2910, 1245, 1089, and 1018 cm−1, which correspond to OH stretching, –CH2 stretching, –CH2OH (side chain) related mode, CO stretching, and C–O–C stretching, respectively (Fig. 1 ) [5,22]. In the spectrum of CS50T0.0, the peak at 1714 cm−1 is a characteristic peak of CO vibration in the carbonyl group from the residual acetate in PVA [23,24]. However, in the spectra of CS50T1.0 and CS50T2.0, peak intensity is significantly reduced and a peak is present at 1141 cm−1. This peak was attributed to CO stretching in the crystalline portion of PVA that was fully hydrolyzed due to the elimination of acetate groups from PVA catalyzed by TEA [25–27]. With the addition of TEA, the –OH band of the CS and PVA shifts from 3274 cm−1 to 3262 cm−1 and becomes broader with lower intensity. The peak at 1420 cm−1, corresponding to the bending vibration of the hydroxyl group, is slightly shifted to a lower frequency at 1407 cm−1 and the peak intensity of free –CH2OH (side chain related mode) at 1245 cm−1 is significantly reduced. These results suggest that TEA induced strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of CS and PVA. Without TEA, residual acetate groups in PVA limited hydrogen bonding between CS and PVA (Fig. 2a). With the addition of TEA, the acetate groups were removed by the elimination process, resulting in closer contact and stronger interactions between CS and PVA, (Fig. 2b-c). As a result, the miscibility of the blend films improved [10,12,24,28]."
7,Mechanical properties,"3.2 Mechanical properties The CS/PVA films without TEA exhibited a very brittle behavior. The samples broke during cutting in preparation for tensile testing, so the mechanical properties of those films were not studied. The tensile strength of CS50 films increased from 3.5 MPa at T0.5 to 15.4 MPa at T2.0 (Fig. 3(a)): an increase of 440%. Elongation at break of the same blends reduced from 36.5% to 14.2% (Fig. 3(b)). The CS/PVA films at other ratios showed similar trends. Interestingly, although the films in this study did not require the use of a crosslinking agent, the results indicate that the addition of TEA produced behaviors generally similar to crosslinking effects. The CS/PVA films showed better tensile properties and more potential to maintain their integrity under stress than those reported previously [12,29]. These behaviors were attributed to intermolecular interactions between hydroxyl groups and the increased crystallinity of CS and PVA, which are consistent with the results above. Films containing the same amount of TEA showed increases in the extensibility of the film with increments of PVA content. These increases were attributed to the stiffening effect of starch and the flexible and hydrophilic nature of PVA [5,29]."
8,Morphology,"3.3 Morphology The miscibility of CS and PVA was examined by SEM. The cryo-fracture surfaces of CS20T0.0 and CS20T0.5 appear rough with heterogeneous cracks (Fig. 4a-b) whereas the cryo-fracture surfaces of CS/PVA films prepared with higher contents (1.0–2.0%) of TEA are smoother and present no voids (Fig. 4c-e). However, some phase separation of CS is visible in the lower area of CS20T1.0 and CS20T1.5 films, which exhibit a continuous phase of PVA. The surface of the CS20T2.0 film is continuous and homogeneous and no phase separation is visible (Fig. 4e). This morphology indicates that TEA induced complete miscibility between CS and PVA, which is consistent with the FTIR data."
9,Thermal behavior,"3.4 Thermal behavior The DSC thermograms of all samples of CS/PVA films at 20 wt% of CS, with and without the addition of TEA (Fig. 5 ), exhibit a single glass transition temperature (Tg) indicating good miscibility between CS and PVA phases [27,30]. The Tg of pure CS/PVA film was 65.5 °C and melting temperature (Tm) was 182.3 °C. With additions of TEA, the shift of Tg to higher temperatures suggests the reduction of segmental mobility and free volume due to increased H-bond formation between polymer chains [24,29]. Moreover, the Tm increased to 190.0 °C and the degree of crystallinity, calculated from the enthalpy of fusion compared to 100% crystalline PVA [21], increased from 16.29% (CS20T0.0) to 19.20% (CS20T2.0). However, at very low TEA content (CS20T0.5), Tm slightly shifted to a lower temperature, probably due to the plasticization effect [11]. The improvement in the crystallinity of the blends and the increased Tm resulted from the elimination process in PVA that was catalyzed by TEA. The elimination process enabled stronger interaction between CS and PVA through the increased formation of H-bonds among the hydroxyl groups of different PVA chains in the amorphous section [13]. These results are in agreement with the results of FT-IR and mechanical testing. Data of all samples are summarized in Table 1 ."
10,Water resistivity and biodegradability,"3.5 Water resistivity and biodegradability Moisture stability is a crucial factor that can affect mechanical properties and dimensional changes of hydrophilic thermoplastics. The moisture stability of the CS/PVA films was studied by measuring moisture absorption at 75%RH. The moisture absorption of the blend films decreased significantly to as low as 3.6% with increments of TEA (Fig. 6 ). The same trend was also exhibited in the water solubility study (Fig. 7 ). The %water solubility of the films was calculated and the results showed that water solubility decreased from 70% to as low as 20% when the amount of TEA was increased. The prepared films in this study showed better water resistivity than was achieved in previous reports [3,29,31,32] despite the higher PVA contents, the higher %RH condition and the absence of crosslinking agent in the present study. Photographs of the films after water immersion are shown in Fig. 7. The CS20T0.0 film exhibits obvious deterioration after immersion in water. However, the CS20T0.5 and CS20T1.0 films show little disintegration and no fragmentation or damage is visible in CS20T1.5 and CS20T2.0. Moreover, it is worth noting that the CS20T2.0 film is clearly less swollen than the other films. TEA eliminated acetate groups that weakened and limited hydrogen bonding in partially hydrolyzed PVA. At increased levels of TEA, free volume was reduced and moisture stability and water resistance were significantly improved [24]. Thus, intermolecular interactions between CS and PVA became stronger, leading to more compact molecular packing and lower water binding capacity. As a result, water molecules were prevented from penetrating and dissolving the films and water sensitivity was reduced [7,9,33]. The CS/PVA films were buried in soil for 30 days. The photographs of CS20T0.5, CS20T1.0, CS20T1.5, and CS20T2.0 films (Fig. 8 ) reveal that degradation by microorganisms occurred. CS20T0.0 completely degraded within 30 days but the degradation of the films was delayed when TEA was added. The final condition of the films improved as the TEA content increased. The increased resistance of the CS/PVA films to biodegradation was attributed to the reduction in moisture sensitivity brought about by TEA."
11,Conclusions,"The addition of TEA to CS/PVA blends produced highly stable films. TEA increased intermolecular interactions via hydrogen bonding between CS and PVA. The improved miscibility and crystallinity of the blends was due to the elimination process of residual acetate groups in PVA. The stronger interaction and more compact molecular packing between CS and PVA improved mechanical properties, increasing tensile strength by as much as 440%. Moreover, moisture absorption was reduced and the water resistance of the blend films increased 70% even at high PVA content. These properties are beneficial for the practical application of biodegradable films. Finally, the good structural integrity of the products provided excellent physical performance and mechanical properties, while biodegradation was delayed. These highly stable CS/PVA films show the potential to be low-cost, biodegradable, alternative materials."
