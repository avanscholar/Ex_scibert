0,Introduction,"Several environmental factors challenge the world today. With pollution issues and the rapid depletion of fossil fuels threatening the availability of energy sources into the next decade, there is an urgent need for an alternate, eco-friendly and renewable energy source. For a majority of the developing countries, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management has been a challenging problem to tackle with. While a multitude of ways are available for disposing of the MSW, landfilling remains a prime procedure. An MSW landfill is a discrete area of land or excavation that receives a variety of wastes from domestic and industrial installations. Although this method enables us to collect the waste effectively, there are conspicuous drawbacks to our environment that we cannot afford to ignore. Bio-inorganic substances like plastics and metals present in MSW take an extensive amount of time to degrade and also lead to a high risk of contaminating the groundwater, mainly during the rainy season (Kaushal et al., 2012). Incineration, which is controlled combustion of waste with heat recovery and landfilling, is carried out at the high risk of polluting air, water, and land (Sharholy et al., 2008). Finding better ways of treating MSW is a top priority now. Urban India generated about 58.875 million tons per annum of MSW in 2018, of which only 23% was treated (TERI, 2020). The peculiar aspect of Indian MSW lies in its non-segregation at source, and comprises compostable matter (51–53%), recyclable matter (17–18%), and possess a moisture content of 46–49% (Nandan et al., 2017). Chennai city ranks third in the volume of MSW generation among the metropolitan cities in India, producing around 5000 tons per day with the highest per capita generation of 1.01 kg/person/day (Dutta and Jinsart, 2020). MSW is a combination of diverse materials like waste plastics, bio-organics like food wastes and rotten vegetables, garden wastes, inert substances like metals and sand, and other wastes like jute, cloth rag, wrappers, along with a significant amount of moisture. Conversion of MSW to value-added products through thermochemical processes can escalate the economic activity of the country and reduce dumping costs. Among the existing thermochemical conversion technologies, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is the only process that can handle feedstocks containing high moisture, unlike pyrolysis and gasification processes that require costly pre-drying of the feedstock to reduce the moisture level to 10–20 wt% (Peterson et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2015). HTL stamps out this costly drying process step thereby making it more economical and appealing (Pedersen et al., 2016). HTL employs subcritical water (300–400 °C, 15–20 MPa) to decompose the heavy molecules into shorter-chain compounds with combustion properties similar to bio-oil (Gautam and Vinu, 2020). It is also feedstock-agnostic as it is shown to convert a wide variety of feedstocks to useful products. At sub-critical conditions, water behaves like a non-polar solvent possessing reduced density, viscosity, and dielectric constant. This enhances the solubility of organic compounds like fatty acids, carbohydrates, and plastics. Moreover, with the increase in ionic product of water at sub-critical conditions, a relatively high amount of H+ and OH– ions are produced. These promote acid-base catalyzed reactions like hydrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, proteins, and fatty acids present in the waste feedstock (Zhu et al., 2015). The effects of operating conditions such as temperature, residence time, pressure, and solvent density on the yield of bio-crude from various feedstocks such as biomass, algae wastes (Toor et al., 2011; Gautam and Vinu, 2020), rice straw (Singh et al., 2015; Yerrayya et al., 2020), mixed plastic wastes containing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (Takeshita et al., 2004), and sewage sludge (Qian et al., 2017) have been studied. In all cases, the reaction temperature and residence time appeared to be one of the significant parameters affecting the product yields and quality in terms of composition and heating value. Akhtar and Amin (2011) reported that solvent density is also one of the major parameters that affect product yields. In a recent study, Cao et al. (2016) employed a higher density solvent (glycerol) along with water (1:1 v/v) and obtained ~50 wt% bio-crude yield from HTL of rice straw at 260 °C. However, only 17 wt% of bio-crude was obtained when water was used as the only solvent at 280 °C. Methods of controlling the counteracting thermal effects include the addition of a stabilizing co-solvent that acts as a radical scavenger through hydrogen donation. Co-solvents with low molecular weights such as phenol, propanol, ethanol, methanol, and glycerol have been applied, and are preferable to obtain low molecular weight products (Singh et al., 2014; Isa et al., 2018). Since MSW contains a relatively high amount of plastics, it is evident in literature that water at sub-critical temperatures (280–350 °C) is not suitable to efficiently decompose the plastics and most of the waste plastic degradation happens at high temperatures or super-critical state of water (Kronholm et al., 2006; Moriya and Enomoto, 1999; Wu et al., 2017). Takeshita et al. (2004) observed the effective decomposition of waste PVC to form non-halogenated compounds with water at sub-critical conditions. Operating the HTL in extreme conditions poses safety risks in addition to being an energy-intensive process. Using a co-solvent that has higher critical properties, that is cheap and that has a higher density than water is expected to yield better results at sub-critical conditions. Among co-solvents, glycerol is preferred, as it is available in sufficient quantities as a by-product of biodiesel production. There are two major components in this study that are novel. Firstly, this study is the first of its kind to report the optimization of process parameters for HTL of heterogeneous and unsegregated MSW of the Indian origin to obtain bio-crude and solid residue. Secondly, this study reports the use of glycerol as a co-solvent in preventing the re-polymerization of fragmented components of MSW and to improve the yield and quality of HTL bio-crude. Thorough characterization of the product fractions and energy analysis of the process have been carried out to provide a holistic understanding of HTL technology for MSW valorization."
1,Materials and methods,"The MSW feedstock was procured from Chennai Municipal Corporation, from its sorting center in Vengadamangalam (12°51′47″ N, 80°8′42″ E), Chennai. Through size-based separation, a significant fraction of bio-organics was separated from bio-inorganic portion of the MSW. Visual appearance revealed that this MSW contains a significant amount of plastic packaging waste, garden waste, cloth pieces, inorganic materials (glass), and inert materials (stones and construction wastes). The MSW was sieved to minimize or eliminate the ash and inorganic matter contained in it, and was shredded into small pieces in the size range of 4.75 mm to 1.5 mm. CHNS content of MSW was analyzed by using a Thermo Flash 2000 series elemental analyzer. The proximate analysis of MSW was carried out using an automatic multi sampler Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA-2000A, Navas Instruments) by taking a sample weight of 0.8 g according to ASTM E1131-08 method (ASTM 2021). The TG mass loss profiles of MSW and the HTL bio-crude were acquired by using an SDTQ-600 TGA (T.A. Instruments) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in nitrogen ambience (100 mL min−1). The higher heating value (HHV) of MSW was determined by using an IKA C2000 bomb calorimeter. The solvents used were distilled water, and water with co-solvents such as glycerol and tetralin, of analytical grades."
2,Experimental procedure,"2.1 Experimental procedure The HTL experiments were conducted in an electrically-heated batch autoclave reactor of 1.3 L volume equipped with a magnetically-driven stirrer. The details about the HTL reactor are available in our earlier publications (Chopra et al., 2019; Yerrayya et al., 2020). Accurate control of temperature of the reactor contents (within ±5 °C) was achieved using a K-type thermocouple inserted into a thermowell. Pressure was monitored using a pressure gauge fitted to the reactor head. The reactor head was equipped with two valves to facilitate the initial pressurization of the reactor, and venting out the gases at the end of experiment. In a typical HTL experiment, 25 g of MSW was loaded into the reactor with 300 mL of solvent. Experiments were performed by taking either distilled water or water-glycerol (1:1 v/v) solvent system. The reactor was initially pressurized using N2 gas to 3–4 MPa, which is based on desired final temperature. Temperature is the most significant parameter that affects bio-crude yield or biomass conversion, and it may vary from 300 to 374 °C depending on the feedstock type (Akhtar and Amin, 2011). At high temperatures, the influence of particle size on product yields is expected to be minimal. The reactor temperature was set to 300, 325, and 350 °C, and maintained for 15, 30, and 45 min. Due to the increase in heat capacity of solvent with temperature, pressure augmented at the rate of 0.15 MPa oC−1 (from 280 to 320 °C) to 0.2 MPa oC−1 (from 320 to 350 °C). The experiments were generally repeated thrice to determine the standard deviation of product yields."
3,Separation and extraction procedure,"2.2 Separation and extraction procedure The reaction products were collected through the bottom flush valve of the reactor. The reactor was cooled and then the gases were vented out. The reactor was then rinsed with 50 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) to extract the majority of the organic soluble fraction. The reactor was flushed with acetone to ensure that the reactor was free from any residue from the previous experiments. The obtained product was a mixture of solids and liquids, and can be termed as ‘kerogen’. The product mixture was filtered through a Whatmann filter paper (0.2 μm) using vacuum filtration to separate the solid residue. The weight of the solid residue was calculated by subtracting the weight of filter paper. The liquid mixture was separated into the DCM phase and aqueous phase using a separation funnel. The organic fraction was separated from the DCM phase by evaporating DCM in an air hot oven at 40 °C. This resulted in a viscous material called bio-crude. The gases from the experiment were collected in a Tedlar® gas sampling bag for further analysis. The bio-crude and solid residue yields were calculated by using the following equations, while the yield of gas + aqueous products was calculated using mass balance. (1) Yield o f B i o c r u d e ( % ) = Mass o f b i o c r u d e Mass o f M S W × 100 (2) Yield o f S o l i d r e s i d u e ( % ) = Mass o f s o l i d r e s i d u e Mass o f M S W × 100"
4,Analysis of products,"2.3 Analysis of products The bio-crude obtained from HTL experiments was diluted 10 times in DCM and subjected to composition analysis in a Gas Chromatograph / Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS, Shimadzu GC-2010 and QP 2010). Typically, 1 µL of the sample was injected at a split ratio of 1:50. The separation was performed using a Rxi-5 sil MS capillary column (30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness). The carrier gas, helium (99.9995% purity, 5.5 grade), was used at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The temperature of the GC oven was programmed as follows: 40 °C for 1 min, followed by a ramp to 280 °C at 5 °C min−1, and held for 15 min at this temperature. The injector, interface, and MS ion source temperatures were held at 280 °C, 280 °C, and 250 °C, respectively. The unknown compounds were identified by comparing the mass spectra with NIST and bio-fuels mass spectral database. The organic compounds with a high match factor of > 85% were considered for product classification. The elemental composition and HHV of the bio-crude and solid residue were determined using the elemental analyzer and bomb calorimeter using the methods described in Section 2. These analyses were repeated thrice and the mean values are reported. The standard deviation was within ± 4%. The functional groups present in the bio-crude and solid residue were determined using an Agilent Cary 630 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The spectra were obtained in attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR) at a resolution of 4 cm−1. For selected experiments, the vented gases were collected in Tedlar® gas sampling bags and were analyzed using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A molecular sieve 13-X packed column was used for the separation of gases. The carrier gas nitrogen (99.999% purity) was used at a flow rate of 3 mL min−1. The injector and the detector temperatures were maintained at 250 °C and 180 °C, respectively. The column oven temperature was set at 50 °C for 20 min."
5,Results and discussion,
6,MSW characterization,"3.1 MSW characterization Table 1 depicts proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, and HHV of the MSW sample. MSW contains a high percentage of volatile matter (78.7 wt%), which is greater than that in any other biomass, owing to the high plastic content in it. A real landfill MSW contains ash (~15 wt%) similar to cow dung which is higher than any other biomass. From the ultimate analysis, it is clear that MSW contains a high amount of carbon (50.4 ± 5.5 wt%), which is similar to that of biomasses (Patil et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2014), and has an oxygen content of 30.7 ± 5.1 wt%, which is typically lower than most of the biomasses. Its hydrogen content is greater than most of the woody and algal biomass types (Karagoz et al., 2005; Gautam and Vinu, 2020). HHV of the sample is in the range of 17–21 MJ kg−1, which is attributed to its heterogeneous and co-mingled nature. The ultimate analysis and HHV data are in line with MSW from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Kathirvale et al, 2004). The mass loss and differential mass loss profiles are depicted in Fig. 1 . The thermal decomposition of various components of MSW occurs in different temperature regimes. The initial mass loss up to 100 °C can be attributed to the loss of moisture physically adsorbed in the material. The mass loss in the range of 160–350 °C can be ascribed to the decomposition of garden waste, paper waste, cloth and other cellulosic matter in MSW. In the third step, 400–500 °C, the thermal degradation of plastics present in the MSW like polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene occurs (Suriapparao and Vinu, 2015). The final amount of solid residue left behind at 790 °C was 28.5 wt%, which is higher than the sum of fixed carbon and ash present in the sample. This can be attributed, atleast partially, to the heterogeneous nature of the sample."
7,Hydrothermal liquefaction,"3.2 Hydrothermal liquefaction Initial experiments were carried out using only water as a solvent. Typically, 25 g of MSW and 300 mL of water were taken, which occupied 30% of the total reactor volume. The solid concentration was maintained at 8 wt% for all the experiments. Many researchers had reported that an increase in solid concentration hinders the interactions between the molecules of solvent and solids, while decreasing in loading increases the concentration of organics in the aqueous phase (Yin et al., 2010; Akhtar and Amin, 2011; Yerrayya et al., 2020). Liu et al. (2013) reported a similar solid loading to obtain maximum bio-crude yield from corn stalks. For compact feedstocks, it was reported that the temperature range from 300 to 350 °C is suitable for HTL (Akhtar and Amin, 2011). In this study, experiments were carried out at four different temperatures 300, 320, 330, and 350 °C. Fig. 2 (a) depicts the product distribution at different operating conditions. It was observed that the bio-crude yield increased only marginally with increase in reaction temperature from 300 to 330 °C, while it almost doubled to 15.2 wt% at 350 °C. This can be attributed to the beginning of decomposition of the plastic fraction. The bio-crude was viscous and dark brown to black in color, and was soluble in DCM. When water was taken as the sole solvent, the decomposition of only the lignocellulosic fraction of the MSW occurred leaving sheet-like deposits of unconverted plastics in the solid residue. Water alone was not able to hydrolyze the MSW at sub-critical conditions. Moreover, the use of only water as the solvent produced more water-soluble organics amounting to 5 wt% of the aqueous phase. The extraction of products from the reactor was complicated due to the clogging of undecomposed material in various parts of the reactor such as in the outlet port and stirrer blades. 3.2.1 HTL with Water-Glycerol as solvent Solvents possessing high self-ionization constant, density and dipole moment than water, and low dielectric constant than water enhance solvolysis and hydration reactions, which eventually results in better fragmentation of the feedstock (Peterson et al., 2008). Moreover, the bio-crude obtained using water as the solvent was very viscous, and the use of an organic solvent for liquefaction can be effective for reducing the viscosity of bio-crude in the HTL process (Xiu et al., 2010). Depending on these factors, glycerol was chosen as a co-solvent with water considering the economic aspects of its production and availability. Typically, glycerol is a by-product in biodiesel production via transesterification and can be a promising solvent in the HTL process. Owing to milder critical properties of glycerol than water, moderate reaction conditions can be employed. The equal composition mixture of water-glycerol has relatively high critical temperature and low critical pressure (475 °C, 14.75 MPa) compared to critical properties of water (374 °C, 22.0 MPa). This makes HTL using glycerol co-solvent a promising option to investigate the decomposition of MSW constituents at sub-critical conditions with an added advantage of better dissolution of the decomposition products in the organic phase. Experiments were conducted at three different temperatures (300, 325, and 350 °C) and residence times (15, 30, and 45 min). Based on the economics and ease of operation of the process, the water-glycerol ratio was maintained at 1:1 v/v, which happens to be the optimum condition in the case of many feedstocks and solvents with water (Akhtar and Amin, 2011). It is observed that glycerol effectively degraded the MSW (including plastic content) as compared to the case with only water as the solvent. At 350 °C, the obtained oil yield was 58 wt%, whereas only 15.2 wt% of oil yield was obtained with only water as the solvent. Many researchers reported that a significant increase in the yield of bio-crude can be obtained when glycerol is used as a co-solvent with water during HTL of rice straw, swine manure, and aspen wood (Pedersen et al., 2016; Xiu et al., 2010). For the first time, we utilized the co-solvent glycerol for the HTL of complicated feedstock like MSW. The production of more hydroxyl ions from glycerol might be one of the reasons for effective degradation. One of the advantages of using glycerol as a co-solvent is that its self-decomposition to oily products starts at > 350 °C (Bayramoğlu et Al., 2014). Kerogen extraction from the reactor was also facile when glycerol was used as the co-solvent. 3.2.2 Effect of temperature on product distribution The reaction temperature is one of the important parameters that affects the bio-crude yield. The optimum temperature for a high yield of bio-crude depends on the feedstock composition. As MSW contains plastics, high temperatures are favorable for degradation due to their heat-resisting characteristics. For compact feedstocks, the temperature can range from 300 °C to 350 °C (Akhtar and Amin, 2011). Fig. 2(b) depicts the distribution of products at different temperatures and residence time periods for a water-glycerol co-solvent system. As the temperature increased from 300 °C to 350 °C at any specific residence time, the oil yield increased consistently, while the solid residue yield decreased. At 30 min residence time, the bio-crude yield followed the trend: 58.7 wt% (350 °C) > 52 wt% (325 °C) > 25.9 wt% (300 °C). At the same residence time, the solid residue yield followed the trend: 67.9 wt% (300 °C) > 41.3 wt% (325 °C) > 30.3 wt% (350 °C). These trends are also consistent with the HTL results of poplar sawdust where the increase in temperature intensifies the degree of degradation of biochemical components of the feedstock (Demirbas, 2008). At higher temperature, glycerol aids in reducing the surface tension of the cooking solvent, fostering the diffusion of breakdown products of MSW constituents and stabilizing the unstable fragmented components of the feedstock to an extent by obstructing the secondary reactions between them. This enhances the yield of organic bio-crude. There was only a mild increase in the yield of gas + aqueous products from 5 to 10 wt% as the temperature was increased. In the case of most of the lignocellulosic feedstocks, there is a threshold temperature beyond which a further increase in temperature leads to a decrease in the yield of bio-crude (Zhu et al., 2015; Anastasakis and Ross, 2015; Gai et al., 2015). However, in dealing with MSW and water-glycerol co-solvent system, high temperature leads to the decomposition of glycerol into acrolein and other oily products, especially beyond 350 °C. Therefore, the upper temperature in this study is limited to 350 °C. The viscosity of the bio-crude generally decreases with an increase in temperature because at high temperatures severe cracking lead to the formation of low molecular weight and low carbon number compounds. At high temperatures, however, depolymerization and re-polymerization reactions can also occur via free radical pathways. These can promote the yield of char via cyclization and condensation reactions. It was observed that an increase in temperature decreases the formation of water-soluble organics, which is mainly ascribed to the conversion of water-soluble organics to gas (Huang and Yuan, 2015). Moreover, plastics in MSW may serve as hydrogen donors in the HTL process. The active hydrogen may aid in stabilizing the free radicals thereby reducing the condensation reactions to form polyaromatic structures (Yuan et al., 2009). At low temperatures, the majority of solid residue contains undecomposed plastics, which was visually observed. 3.2.3 Effect of residence time on product distribution The trends in product yields at different residence times are also evident from Fig. 2(b). Sasaki et al. (2003) reported that the rates of hydrolysis and decomposition are relatively faster at near-critical conditions, especially for cellulose. Therefore, a shorter residence time is anticipated to promote effective solubilization and degradation of the feedstock. As inferred from Fig. 2(b), the increase in residence time from 15 min to 45 min enhances the yield of bio-crude at all temperatures. A reverse trend was observed in the yield of solid residue. Importantly, the residence time is also linked to processing temperature (Cao et al., 2016). The yield of bio-crude increased by 6 wt% when the residence time was increased from 15 min to 45 min at 300 °C, whereas only 2 wt% increment was obtained at 350 °C. This can be attributed, at least partially, to the competitive reactions, viz., hydrolysis and re-polymerization, of the fragmented components of the MSW. The yield of solid residue decreased from 72 wt% to 64.2 wt% with the rise in residence time from 15 min to 45 min at 300 °C, indicating that organic matter begin to decompose at 15 min and it is almost completed at 45 min. The residence time plays a major role in the degradation of plastics at high temperatures. Longer residence time can lead to decomposition of the liquid bio-crude to non-condensable gases. More importantly, in HTL, the optimum residence time depends on the feedstock type and temperature. In this study, the optimum condition for maximum bio-crude production is shown to be 350 °C and 30 min. No significant change in the yield was observed when the residence time was further increased. In fact, the optimum condition is also supported by the quality and composition of the bio-crude, which is discussed in further sections."
8,Characterization of bio-crude,"3.3 Characterization of bio-crude 3.3.1 Elemental analysis and HHV of bio-crude The bio-crudes obtained from HTL of MSW at different temperatures and residence times with water-glycerol solvent system were dark-brown in color. Table 2 depicts the elemental composition and HHVs of bio-crudes obtained at different conditions. The carbon content of these bio-crudes is higher than that of the feedstock and increases with an increase in temperature and residence time. At high processing temperatures, the viscosity of the water-glycerol solvent decreases, which enhances the diffusivity of the solvent into the biomass matrix for better degradation. The oxygen content of the bio-crude decreased significantly with the increase in reaction temperature. The O/C ratio of the feedstock was 0.65 and for the bio-crude, it decreased to 0.15 at 350 °C, 45 min. This shows that the HTL process leads to significant de-oxygenation, via decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions. There is no significant change in H-content in the bio-crude as compared to the feedstock, which indicates the competing nature of hydrogenation via hydrogen transfer from the solvent, and the possible dehydrogenation leading to the release of hydrogen in the form of H2 and CH4. The plastics present in MSW can be thought to assist the removal of oxygen by supplying hydrogen, thereby intensifying the dehydration process. This is also verified from the elemental analysis of the bio-crude where oxygen is reduced from 30 wt% to 15 wt% at 350 °C and 45 min. From the elemental mass balance in the products (Fig. 3 (a)), it is evident that carbon and hydrogen present in the feedstock are mostly retained in the bio-crude, which increases with process temperature. H/C ratio of bio-crude was found to be 1.3. At high temperature (350 °C), there is no significant variation in elemental carbon and hydrogen in the bio-crude, especially concerning residence time. The increased carbon and hydrogen content, and decreased oxygen content results in a better calorific value of the bio-crude than the MSW feedstock. Table 2 also depicts the HHV of bio-crude samples at different temperatures and residence times. The highest value of HHV of 35.6 MJ kg−1 was obtained at 350 °C and 30 min. There is a good potential to improve the HHV to 42–44 MJ kg−1 after mild hydrotreatment of the bio-crude. HHV of the bio-crude increased from ~29 to 35.6 MJ kg−1 with an increase in temperature from 300 to 350 °C. No significant change in HHV was observed when residence time was varied. The yield of bio-crude from MSW is high as compared to that from biomass, algae, and sewage sludge at similar HTL reaction conditions (Xu and Etcheverry, 2008; Akalın et al, 2012; Gautam and Vinu, 2020). The HHV of HTL bio-crude is also high as compared to pyrolysis bio-oil, primarily due to low oxygen content (Toor et al., 2011). Bio-crude of this kind can be employed directly as boiler fuel or as a blendstock with crude-oil for refinery processing. 3.3.2 GC/MS analysis of Bio-crude The chemical composition of the bio-crude obtained at different temperatures and residence times was assessed using GC/MS. The organic compounds were categorized into furans, phenols, cyclo-oxygenates, aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and others, which primarily includes nitrogen-containing organics. Fig. 3(b) shows that the temperature significantly influences the selectivity of the products such as cyclo-oxygenates, phenols, aliphatic hydrocarbons and furan derivatives. Generally, the formation of furans, phenols, and aliphatic hydrocarbons increased with an increase in temperature, linear oxygenates and cyclo-oxygenates decreased with an increase in temperature. The furan compounds were pronounced only at 325 and 350 °C, and their selectivity was low (3–7%). The formation of furan compounds such as 5-ethyl-2-furaldehyde, monomethyl- and dimethyl benzofuran can be ascribed to the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulosic matter in the papers, leaves, and woody materials. These were present in MSW in the form of garden wastes. The degradation of lignin results in the formation of phenolic compounds (Huang and Yuan, 2015). The major phenolic compounds were phenol, 2-methyl and 4-methyl phenols (o-cresol and p-cresol), ethyl phenol, 2,6-dimethyl and 2,4-dimethyl phenols (xylenols), 3,4,5-trimethyl phenol, and ethyl methyl phenols. Phenol appeared to be one of the major thermal decomposition products of polystyrene in the MSW (Singh and Sharma, 2008). Kruse et al. (2013) reported that the decomposition of furfural and furfural derivatives also produces phenolic compounds. The major linear oxygenates produced at 300 °C were fatty acids and fatty acid methyl esters. The formation of the esters can be traced to esterification reaction between acids and glycerol. This is a typical reaction when alcohols are used as co-solvents (Yerrayya et al., 2020). The fatty acids include lauric acid, decanoic acid, and palmitic acid, and their formation can be traced to the decomposition of extractives and oily compounds present in MSW (Akalın et al, 2012). The formation of alcohol is mostly from the hydrogenation of glucose and hydration reactions of aliphatic hydrocarbons. With increasing temperature, the selectivity to linear oxygenates decreases significantly to < 5%, which shows their secondary transformation via cyclization reaction to form aliphatic hydrocarbons and phenols. The aromatic hydrocarbons included toluene, xylene, ethyl methyl benzenes, methyl-substituted indenes and methyl-substituted naphthalenes. The formation of multi-ring aromatics can be attributed to bimolecular condensation and Diels-Alder reactions among fragmented components of the feedstock. The carbon number of the compounds in the bio-crude was in the range of C5 C26, and at high temperatures (350 °C), long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons were pronounced (see supplementary material). This can be primarily attributed to severe cracking reactions of plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The aliphatic hydrocarbons are mainly comprised of long-chain compounds such as hexadecane, 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl hexadecane (C20H42), nonadecane (C19H40), eicosane (C20H42), octadecane (C18H38), and tetradecane(C14H30). Major compounds such as tetradecane, dodecanoic acid, methyl octonate, ethylphenol, and methylphenol were identified when water was used as the sole solvent. The typical carbon number distribution of the products in the bio-crude at 350 °C-30 min is given by: C5 C10 (47.2%), C11 C16 (12.7%), >C16 (12%). This demonstrates the reasonable fuel value of the bio-crude. The typical trends in the major organic fractions at different temperatures and residence times are given by: Phenols: 33.5% (350 °C,30 min) > 27.8% (325 °C,30 min) > 17.9% (300 °C,30 min); 35.8% (350 °C,15 min) > 33.5% (350 °C,30 min) > 12.4% (350 °C,45 min); Cyclo-oxygenates: 53.5% (300 °C,30 min) > 32% (325 °C,30 min) ≈ 32.8% (350 °C,30 min); 35.7% (350 °C,15 min) > 32.8% (350 °C,30 min) > 28.1% (350 °C,45 min); Aliphatic hydrocarbons: 22.3% (350 °C,45 min) > 14.3% (350 °C,30 min) > 12% (350 °C,15 min). The density of the solvent plays an important role in the HTL process, and this influences the reaction pathways of each component. As the solvent is a mixture of water and alcohol, both hydrolysis and alcoholysis processes dominate the conversion of the MSW into various organic compounds. At low temperatures (150–180 °C), dehydration of hemicellulose portion yields phenols and furan derivatives and triggers the formation of gases like CO, CO2 via ring scission, or decomposition of acids with an increase in temperature. Cellulosic portion degrades to form glucose, which on further degradation produces ketones and aldehydes. At temperatures>300 °C, lignin and plastic content of MSW starts to depolymerize and produce long-chain aliphatic, and oxygenated compounds. Formation of linear oxygenates and aromatics, especially naphthalene derivatives are expected to form from the intermediate compounds like acetaldehyde and benzoic acid, which are formed due to the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate present in the plastic fraction of MSW. It is observed that at temperatures > 325 °C, the plastic portion of MSW tends to decompose more via severe cracking reactions, and thus lead to the formation of aliphatic compounds such as eicosane, tetradecane, nonadecane, and gaseous compounds in the range of C2 C4 hydrocarbons. At high temperatures and pressures, polystyrene depolymerizes to styrene, which in turn undergoes redox-reactions to form phenolic compounds and benzene derivatives. Apart from phenolic compounds, the other important product type in the bio-crude is cyclo-oxygenated compounds. The major compounds in this category include (a) 2-cyclopenten-1-one (C5H6O) and its monomethyl and dimethyl derivatives, and (b) Cis-4-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane (C5H10O3). Both these compounds and their derivatives are valuable for the fine chemical industry, especially in the manufacture of fragrances and flavors, and they are also observed in natural products. At 325 °C-30 min, the typical distribution of cyclopentenones and dioxolanes within the cyclo-oxygenates was 30% and 25%, respectively, while at 350 °C-30 min, the distribution was 57% and 6%, respectively. This shows that there is a good possibility to extract fine chemicals like cyclopentenones from the bio-crude fraction. 3.3.3 Effect of tetralin on quantity and quality of bio-crude Tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) is a popular hydrogen donor solvent used to enhance the yield of liquid products from coal in the direct coal liquefaction process (Vasireddy et al., 2011). The salient advantage of using hydrogen donor solvents over molecular hydrogen gas is the weak bond strength of CH as compared to the HH bond. In this work, an HTL experiment was conducted with water-tetralin (1:1 v/v) as solvent at the optimum reaction condition (350 °C, 30 min) identified in the case of glycerol-water co-solvent system. The yields of bio-crude, solid residue and gas + aqueous were 60 wt%, 36 wt% and 4 wt%, respectively. The solid residue was in fine powdered form and well mixed with the solvent, rendering easy handling in the collection of products. The elemental analysis of the bio-crude revealed that it contained slightly higher amount of carbon (79 wt%) and hydrogen (8.9 wt%) than that obtained using glycerol. This is reflected in higher HHV of the bio-crude (37.5 MJ kg−1). This can be ascribed to the facile liberation of hydrogen free radicals from tetralin, which improves the thermal deconstruction of the macromolecules of MSW via hydrogenation and hydrocracking reactions. This also results in greater expulsion of oxygen from the feedstock matrix in the form of CO2 and H2O. Overall, these result in 63% deoxygenation of the feedstock yielding only 10.5% oxygen in the bio-crude. While the intent is not to prove that tetralin is a better co-solvent than glycerol, the results demonstrate that the improvement in quality of the bio-crude is only marginally high with tetralin, and that with glycerol is comparable. In fact, for the same purity, tetralin is ten times costlier than glycerol. Therefore, glycerol is a promising solvent for HTL of MSW owing to its low cost and easy availability as a by-product from bio-diesel production."
9,Characterization of solid residue,"3.4 Characterization of solid residue To find the applications of solid residue in the chemical industry, its quality needs to be assessed in terms of elemental and HHV analysis. As shown in Table 2, the carbon and hydrogen content in the residue is high in the case of water:tetralin (1:1 v/v) co-solvent system with H/C ratio of 1.8, O/C ratio of 0.2, and HHV of 21.3 MJ kg−1. When tetralin was used as the co-solvent, it forms naphthalene, cis-decalin and trans-decalin, which can be recovered from the solid residue. This leads to an increase in carbon and hydrogen content (Isa et al., 2018). The solid residue produced with water-glycerol solvent system has a maximum carbon content of 41 wt% and 6 wt% of hydrogen at 350 °C. Moreover, the carbon and hydrogen content increases with an increase in the temperature indicating rapid de-oxygenation at higher temperatures. This is also verified by the significant reduction of oxygen retention in the solid residue at 350 °C (Fig. 3(a)). Since the solid residue possesses HHV, which is as good as coal (18–25 MJ kg−1), it can be used for bioenergy applications by blending with coal or with other biomass feedstocks."
10,FTIR analysis of bio-crude and solid residue,"3.5 FTIR analysis of bio-crude and solid residue Bio-crudes obtained at different temperatures (300, 325, 350 °C) using water-glycerol solvent were subjected to FTIR analysis to confirm the functional groups (see supplementary material). A broadband around 3390 cm−1, ascribed to the hydroxyl (OH) stretch, shows the presence of phenols. The sharp peaks at 2936 and 2861 cm−1 correspond to CH stretch of the methylene group (CH2). The peak at 1693 cm−1 can be attributed to the conjugated CO stretch indicating the presence of ketonic groups of cyclo-oxy compounds. The peaks at 1543 cm−1 correspond to the bending of CC in the aromatic ring and stretching of carboxylic groups (CO) in carboxylic acids. The peaks in the range of 1380–1454 cm−1 correspond to CH deformation indicating the presence of alkane groups. The peak at 1264 cm−1 can be attributed to OH in-plane bend. The peak at 1048 cm−1 corresponds to the primary alcohol CO stretch. The presence of aromatic content in bio-crude is confirmed by aromatic CH stretch at 737 cm−1. The FTIR spectrum of bio-crude using water-tetralin solvent had a major peak at 1003 cm−1 corresponding to methylene CH2 vibration arising from cyclohexane ring, signifying the presence of residual tetralin. Moreover, the vibration due to conjugated ketones was absent. The FTIR spectra of the solid residue exhibited a broadband around 3300 cm−1 caused by OH group vibration of phenols or moisture present. The peak at 2912 cm−1 and the weak band near 2945 and 2860 cm−1 can be attributed to CH stretch. The peak at 1684 cm−1, and those between 1500 and 1600 cm−1 signify aromatic combination bands, and these confirmed the presence of aromatic compounds in the residue. The peaks between 1290 and 1050 cm−1 represent carbonyl and alcoholic CO stretching vibrations. The peak at 1025 cm−1 is ascribed to the CN stretch or silicone group and can be associated with the presence of ash content in the residue. The peaks in the range of 800–730 cm−1 in the fingerprint region correspond to aliphatic CH2- deformation and aromatic bend respectively. The solid residue obtained using water-tetralin solvent was rich in aromatics with lesser oxygenated functional groups (see supplementary material)."
11,Thermogravimetric analysis of bio-crude and solid residue,"3.6 Thermogravimetric analysis of bio-crude and solid residue In order to assess the thermal stability of the bio-crude and the solid residue, TGA was performed (Fig. 1). Three distinct degradation regimes are evident from the differential thermogram. The first low temperature decomposition range (ambient – 110 °C) corresponds to the vaporization of low molecular weight compounds like C1-C2 oxygenates like formic acid, acetic acid, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, and moisture trapped in the bio-crude. The broad second decomposition range (120–380 °C) can be attributed to the vaporization of medium to high molecular weight compounds in bio-crude including substituted phenols, aromatics, cyclo-oxygenates and linear long chain hydrocarbons. The final decomposition peak centered at 423 °C can be due to the cracking of long chain molecules and the formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Beyond 500 °C there was no notable mass loss and the residue left behind was 16 wt%. This shows the aromatization of monoaromatics and naphthalene derivatives to ultimately form carbonaceous residue. The differential thermogram of the solid residue shows the depletion of low molecular weight compounds in it. A broad peak corresponding to low mass loss in 100–380 °C range shows the decomposition of high molecular weight compounds, and the major decomposition (400–500 °C) signifies the presence of unconverted or partially converted plastics in the HTL residue."
12,Gas analysis,"3.7 Gas analysis Table 3 depicts the composition of gases produced from selected HTL experiments conducted with different solvents at 350 °C and 30 min. As N2 gas was used to initially pressurize the contents of the reactor, its concentration was high at the end of the process. The amount of CO2 is relatively high in all the three cases studied, which shows that decarboxylation is the major deoxygenation route in HTL. The formation of CO can be attributed to decarbonylation reactions of acids, aldehydes, and ketones. Among the three cases, water-glycerol solvent is found to be effective in deoxygenation via both decarboxylation and decarbonylation routes. Low amount of other gases like C2C4 hydrocarbons and oxygenates were not quantified. The use of tetralin as co-solvent results in slightly lower yield of CO and CO2 as compared to the case of glycerol, but results in significant H2 production, which is clearly due to the facile recombination of hydrogen free radicals generated from tetralin under the process condition."
13,Energetics of the process,"3.8 Energetics of the process The energy required to heat the solvent (Qsolvent), the MSW (QMSW) and the total energy input to HTL (Ei) were calculated as follows: (3) Q solvent = Mass solvent C p , s o l v e n t Δ T (4) Q MSW = Mass MSW C p , M S W Δ T (5) E i = Q solvent + Q MSW 1 - η h / η c where QMSW and ΔT denote energy content of the feedstock and temperature difference, respectively. When a mixture of two solvents was used, mixture rule was adopted to determine the effective heat of the solvent system. The terms η h and η c refer to efficiency of heating and combustion of the bio-crude, which are modestly assumed to be 0.5 and 0.7, respectively (Anastasakis and Ross, 2015). The amount of energy that can be extracted from products mainly depends on the yield of bio-crude because of its higher calorific value. It also depends on the other products, viz., solid residue and non-condensable gases. The energy content of the products (Ep), energy recovery in the products (ERP) and energy recovery ratio (ECR) are given by (Anastasakis and Ross, 2015): (6) E p = Mass biocrude H H V b i o c r u d e + Mass solid H H V s o l i d + ( Mass gas H H V g a s ) (7) E R P % = E P Mass MSW HHV MSW + Q solvent × 100 (8) ECR = E i / E biocrude The energy balance data for the selected experimental conditions are presented in Table 4 . It is evident that the total energy input to HTL follows the trend: Ei (water) > Ei (water-glycerol) > Ei (water-tetralin). This is primarily due to the higher heat capacity of water than glycerol and tetralin, which results in lower energy consumption to heat the solvent mixture. The ERP is found to be highest when tetralin is used as the co-solvent followed by glycerol as the co-solvent, and water as the sole solvent. This shows that the product energy is significant when co-solvents are used. It is worthwhile to note that this preliminary calculation does not include the actual electrical energy spent and the losses. Owing to the high hydrogen content in the products, the calorific values of the bio-crude and solid residue are high when water-tetralin solvent system is used, which leads to a high value of EP. ECR is another metric used to estimate the energy that can be derived from the bio-crude product. An ECR value lesser than unity indicates the energetic feasibility of the process. It is evident from Table 4 that HTL using co-solvents generally leads to a lower ECR of the process for different feedstocks. Importantly, compared to other thermochemical process like pyrolysis or gasification, the ECR is generally lower in the case of HTL. Owing to the presence of plastics in MSW, there is a requirement of high temperature operation (≥350 °C), which slightly increases the input energy. Nevertheless, this would be compensated by the energy content of the products as plastic-rich MSW yields bio-crude of high calorific value, which is closer to that of petroleum crude oil (40–44 MJ kg−1). It is worthwhile to note that technoeconomic considerations also dictate the viability of the process wherein the cost of solvent plays a crucial role for commercial deployment. This calls for further research and development to assess the energy and economics of the process in larger batch reactor systems and at continuous scale."
14,Conclusions,"The addition of glycerol to water is shown to significantly improve the yield and quality of the bio-crude from heterogeneous MSW. The bio-crude yield increased by four times to 58 wt% when glycerol was used as co-solvent as compared to using only water at the optimal condition of 350 °C-30 min. This also resulted in effective deoxygenation via decarboxylation and decarbonylation leading to high HHV of the bio-crude (35.6 MJ/kg). Glycerol-assisted HTL consumes lesser energy for heating the reaction mixture, which leads to better energy recovery in the products. The bio-crude is rich in valuable products like phenol, cresols and cyclopentenones."
