0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is an attractive energy carrier with its potentially higher energy efficiency and pollutant-free emission [1]. It may be produced using many processes, and steam reforming of methane (SRM) is the most commonly used large-scale process. However, this approach does not avoid the dependence on fossil materials because nowadays, many products as fertilizers, detergents, waxes, fine chemicals, plastics and coke are primarily synthesized from coal, petroleum oil and natural gas. Accordingly, clean energy, including H2, may hypothetically be produced from biomass. For instance, “bioethanol” (alcohol produced by biomass fermentation) can be transformed in H2-rich gas mixes through catalytic process [1,2]. This alcohol, considered a renewable resource, has a relatively high hydrogen content, is readily available in agricultural countries, and is easily stored [1,3]. H2 production from ethanol requires using catalysts that favor H2 selectivity. Steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) [4–6] and partial oxidation of ethanol (POE) [7,8] are extensively studied catalytic reactions for H2 production from ethanol. However, in recent years, oxidative steam reforming of ethanol (OSRE), which combines the SRE and POE reactions, has gained momentum because the reaction enthalpy change could be controlled based on the O2/EtOH/H2O ratio used [3,9–11]. The OSRE process may be expressed by the following Eq. (1) [12]: (1) C 2 H 5 OH + ( 3 - 2 x ) O 2 + ( 6 - 2 x ) H 2 O → ( 6 - 2 x ) H 2 + 2 CO 2 Δ H ° 298 C = [ 173 ( 3 - 2 x ) / 3 ] - 545 ( 2 x / 3 ) kJ mol - 1 The OSRE reaction occurs through a complex mechanism, wherein undesirable products, including ethylene, methane, carbon monoxide, and coke, among others, may be generated, depending on the catalyst used. Therefore, the catalyst design for OSRE reactions aims to increase the efficacy of CC and CH bond breaking and avoid side reactions [13–16], thereby making it possible to improve H2 selectivity and yield. Catalysts with noble metals, primarily Rh, Ru, Pt, and Ir [17,18], have good catalytic performance and high stability in OSRE. However, their high cost and low availability are a disadvantage when scaling up to an industrial level. Other catalysts based on some less expensive metals as cobalt reach activities similar to noble metals in OSRE [2,16,19], albeit with some disadvantages, including low stability, formation of carbonaceous deposits, and loss of surface area, among others. In fact, Co-based catalysts have been extensively studied for hydrogen production through ethanol catalytic transformation [20–22]. Nevertheless, the nature of the cobalt active sites during the reaction continues to be a topic of debate. Many author report that metallic cobalt sites constituted the active phase of the solid but, currently, other studies showed that is necessary an equilibrium state between CoO and Co0 phases for obtaining a solid with excellent catalytic performance [2,11,23]. In this context, research aimed at understanding and controlling these harmful processes is needed. For this purpose, a reasonable approximation in controlling catalyst properties could be achieved using a suitable method for catalyst synthesis. The preparation method directly affect the properties, activity and stability of the material [24]. Besides the type, load and dispersion of the active phase modify the catalyst selectivity [25,26]. The use of highly reactive and thermally stable mixed oxides, synthesized from hydrotalcite (HT)-like materials, has been reported for OSRE [3,10,16,27,28]. Hydrotalcites may be synthesized by various methods like coprecipitation, urea hydrolysis, sol-gel, hydrothermal, etc. [10,12,16]. Guil-López et al. reported a good performance of oxides derived from highly crystalline LDH-precursors prepared by urea hydrolysis method for the autothermal reforming of ethanol [16]. Nevertheless, this preparation process involves long periods of time that restrict their usage in practical applications. In this context, the coprecipitation method remains the most used method. The use of ultrasound radiation during the synthesis of such materials not only decreases the synthesis time but also improves diffusion properties and the active phase dispersion and enables incorporating larger cations into the catalytic lattice. In this process, acoustic cavitation bubbles collapse into each other, generating high temperatures and pressures and forming hot spots [29,30], which produce solids with small uniform particles and increase the specific surface area [31–35]. Such properties are ultimately reflected in increased catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability [31,36,37]. In such context, CoMgAl mixed oxides were synthesized in this study from the calcination of hydrotalcite-like precursors, which were prepared using the ultrasound-assisted simultaneous coprecipitation method and Co concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 20 w/w%. The catalysts were assessed in the OSRE reaction at 600°C for 8h. The effects of the active phase content on the catalysts’ structural, redox, textural, and morphological properties and activity are discussed herein."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of precursors and mixed oxides,"2.1 Preparation of precursors and mixed oxides Hydrotalcite-like precursors (HT) were synthesized using the ultrasound-assisted simultaneous coprecipitation method. A solution of Al3+, Mg2+, and Co2+ nitrate was used, keeping the proportion of (Mg2+ +Co2+)/Al3+ constant at 3 and ranging the percentage of Co from 0 to 20 w/w%. During coprecipitation, a mixture of nitrates was added to a K2CO3 (0.3M) solution immersed in an ultrasound bath at 42kHz for 1.5h at 65°C and the pH was controlled at 10.5 using NaOH (1M). Subsequently, the solids were washed and dried at 80°C for 24h. Mixed oxides were prepared after HT calcination at 600°C for 8h and were termed OMXCo, where X stands for the percentage of Co."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The chemical composition of the powdered mixed oxides was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) in a Philips MagiX Pro PW2440 spectrometer equipped with a Rh tube with 4kW power. The structure of the catalysts and the formation of carbonaceous structures during the reaction were analyzed by Micro Raman Spectroscopy, using a LabRAM (Horiba Jobin Yvon) spectrometer fitted with a confocal microscope and a 532cm−1 (green laser) excitation wavelength. The crystal structure was assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in a SHIMADZU LAB-X XRD-6000 diffractometer with a Cu anode (λ=1.54056Å), using a 0.02° step size, 2°θ range and a scan speed of 1°θmin−1. The particle size was calculated using the Scherrer equation [38]. H2 temperature-programmed reduction was conducted in a CHEMBET 3000 QUANTACHROME device with a thermal conductivity detector. Each solid (100mg) was degassed beforehand at 400°C for 1h under Ar flow and reduced with a 10°Cmin−1 heating ramp using 10% (v/v) H2/Ar at 30mLmin−1, according to previously reported protocols [12]. The H2 consumptions of the catalysts were normalized based on the mass of each catalyst. The surface area of the catalysts was determined by N2 adsorption-desorption at −196°C, using a MICROMERITICS ASAP 2020 device. The solids had been previously degassed for 2h in N2-He atmosphere at 350°C. Surface composition mapping of the catalysts was performed by scanning transmission electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector, using a FEI QUANTA 200 scanning electron microscope in high-vacuum mode and at a 20kV acceleration voltage. Samples were previously metalized with an AuPd alloy (80–20 w/w%). The particle size and formation of carbonaceous structures were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a Philips CM 200 microscope operating at 200kV."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The OSRE reaction was performed following the previously reported protocol [3,10]. Briefly, the reaction was conducted at atmospheric pressure (560mmHg) and isothermally at 600°C for 8h. The catalyst (50mg) was reduced under pure H2 flow (30mLmin−1) at 600°C for 2h. The aqueous ethanol solution was continuously injected (0.01mLmin−1 liquid) using an isocratic pump, mixed with N2 and air at a total flow rate of 30mLmin−1 and evaporated at 160°C before entering the reactor. A space velocity of 2.2×104 h−1 was used. The molar composition of the feed gas and reaction products were analyzed online in an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph equipped with two columns (HP-PLOT and molecular sieve) and two detectors (flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductibility detector (TCD). The ethanol conversion (XEtOH) and the yield of H2 and subproducts (YP) were determined using Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively: (2) X EtOH = n EtOH in - n EtOH out n EtOH in × 100 (3) Y P = n p out n EtOH in wherein [nP]out is the moles of P produced (P=H2, CO2, CH4, CO, C2H4, C2H6, C2H4O or C2H4O2). Yields were calculated on a dry basis."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Chemical analysis,"3.1 Chemical analysis The chemical composition of the catalysts synthesized is outlined in Table 1 . The solids exhibited mass compositions and molar ratios (M2+/M3+) close to the expected values, which shows the successful incorporation of metals (Co, Mg and Al) using the ultrasound-assisted simultaneous coprecipitation method."
7,Structural analysis,"3.2 Structural analysis Only the diffraction pattern of the HT precursor of the OM10Co catalyst were analyzed because all hydrotalcite (HT)-like precursors with different cobalt contents showed similar X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, its structural evolution is shown by increasing the calcination temperature of the mixed oxide. The diffractograms recorded at 25°C (not shown) reveal signals typical of HT-like structures, wherein intense reflections at 2θ values of 11.3, 22.7 and 34.6° indicate the production of crystalline solids with 3R symmetry (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) file 14-191) [39,40]. No individual signals of Co, Mg, or Al hydroxides were recorded, which could result from the homogeneous incorporation of these cations into brucite sheets. The similarity between the ionic radii of Co2+ (72pm) and Mg2+ (71pm) enables the effective incorporation of these species into the hydrotalcite structure [41]. The intense signal with a low FWHM value associated with the (003) plane suggested a high crystallinity of the precursor. An XRD study as a function of the temperature in the presence of static air was carried out in order to follow the modification and the phase transitions of the HT10Co. The XRD patterns of the materials were measured in situ in flowing air from room temperature to 600°C at every 100°C. A significant loss of crystallinity and the disappearance of the (012), (016), and (018) planes occur when calcining the solid at 300°C, resulting from the loss of interlaminar water and carbonate decomposition [42]. The decrease in the intensity of the (006) plane indicates sheet stacking disorder [42]. The HT structure completely collapses at 400°C, and all new reflections in the pattern (at 2θ=36, 43, and 63°) indicate the presence of low-crystallinity mixed oxides. The crystallinity increases slightly with the calcination temperature (500 and 600°C). The diffraction patterns of the synthesized mixed oxides containing 5, 10, 15 and 20% Co are shown in Fig. 2 . Three intense reflections at 36, 43, and 63° 2Θ are associated with MgO phase (JCPDS 43-1022). In the case of the solids with low cobalt content (5 and 10%), those peaks can also be related with CoO phase (JCPDS 78-1002) because both are cubic systems. The Co2+ species tend to homogeneously disperse within the periclase-like matrix (MgOAl2O3), remaining as stable CoOMgOAl2O3 solid solution with very small particle sizes (Table 1) [43,44]. Previous reports have shown that the oxidation of Co2+ (CoO) to Co3+ (Co2O3 and Co3O4) occurs in Co hydrotalcites calcined under an air atmosphere at temperatures between 500 and 550°C [3,14]. However, the results suggest that the use of ultrasound during the synthesis of solids with low amount of Co, enables stabilizing the Co2+ (CoO) species, even when using a calcination temperature of 600°C for 8h. Probably, the sonication enhances the diffusion of the Co2+ species into sites occupied by Mg2+ in the HT structure, thereby preventing the formation and segregation of the Co3O4 spinel phases after calcination process [43,44]. These results are promising because the spinel-like Co3+ oxides are poor active phase precursors of the OSRE reaction [45,46]. The diffractograms show significant differences between catalysts when the cobalt loading is increased. Co3+-containing phases are favored in OM15Co and OM20Co solids, as shown in Fig. 1. The reflections at 19 and 31° indicate the presence of spinel-like Co structures, including Co3O4, Co2AlO4, CoAl2O4, which are indistinguishable from each other by XRD (Co3O4, JCPDS 74-2120; Co2AlO4, JCPDS 38-0814; CoAl2O4, JCPDS 82-2246) [11]. The formation of such phases results from Co2+ oxidation to Co3+. The segregation of those phases is due to the effect of the smaller ionic radius of Co3+ (68pm vs 71pm of Mg2+) that inhibits to some extent its inclusion of the periclase type solid solution. The number of Co3+ species increases with the Co concentration, and they remain on the surface as Co3O4 crystals [47]. The Scherrer equation results indicate that particle size of the catalysts ranged between 2 and 4nm. These values are lower in comparison to other solids employed in the OSRE [10,12,16,48]. Considering that reduced solids are used as catalyst for the OSRE, the XRD of the solids OM10Co and OM20Co after pretreatment with H2 at 600°C are presented in Fig. 3 . The results evidence that reduction process is not complete under the selected conditions because the presence of the CoO phase. For the case of OM20Co is noticeable the transformation of Co3O4 into CoO after pretreatment. The highest-intensity reflections for the periclase phase and for Co0 overlap near 44° 2Θ, which makes difficult the XRD analysis. Though, a low-intensity peak around 52° 2Θ can be associated with cobalt metallic, corroborating its formation after the activation process of the solids. Furthermore, Fig. 4 shows the analysis of the catalysts by Raman spectroscopy, corroborating the data collected by XRD for the cobalt species present in the mixed oxides. Catalysts with a cobalt content higher than 5% show three active bands in the Raman spectra reported for Co3O4 (470, 580, and 670cm−1) [49–51], whereas the catalyst OM5Co only records two such bands (470 and 580cm−1). Medium-intensity bands at 470 and 580cm−1 correspond to Eg and F2g symmetries [52], respectively, and the band at approximately 670cm−1 results from the presence of octahedral sites (CoO6) with A1 symmetry. For OM10Co the signal at 190cm−1 is noticeable but the other bands can be overlapped because this spectra is more complex. This later signal is associated with the (CoO4) tetrahedral sites with F2g symmetry, indicating the presence of Co aluminates [49]. Table 1 also shows the average aggregate sizes of the mixed oxides calculated using the Scherrer equation. The average particle size was 4nm. This particle size is favored by the synthesis method, in which ultrasound cavitation effects cause the diffusion of small Co particles into the brucite lattice of the HT, which maintains its size even after a calcination process up to 600°C for 8h. The TEM micrographs of the OM10Co and OM20Co solids (Fig. 5 ). The OM20Co catalyst has agglomerates, possibly resulting from the presence of the Co3O4 species associated with a high Co content, which corroborates the results from the XRD analysis of this solid. Furthermore, laminar particles typical of the HT-like precursor are observed, possibly formed by a partial reconstruction of the mixed oxide exposed to environmental conditions (humidity and CO2) during the time interval between the storage of the sample after reaction and the microcopy analysis."
8,Analysis of redox properties,"3.3 Analysis of redox properties The temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of catalysts with different Co contents shown in Fig. 6 evidence two reduction zones. The first low temperature zone (200–600°C) is related to reduction of Co3O4 and CoO. The second one (600–1000°C) is associated to Co- spinel and Co-aluminates that have strong particle–support interaction with the periclase type solid solution. The H2 consumption corresponding to each signal, is calculated from the areas underlying H2-TPR profiles and reported in Table 2 . Considering that Co2AlO4 or CoAl2O4 phases exhibit a low tendency to reduce at low temperatures, is coherent to propose that the peaks in the range 200–600°C correspond to the two-step reduction of Co3O4 [53,54] or one-step reduction of CoO. These events are described by Eq(5) [55]: (4) Co 3 O 4 + H 2 → 3 CoO + H 2 O (5) 3 CoO + 3 H 2 → 3 Co 0 + 3 H 2 O The Co content noticeably has a significant effect on the redox properties of the material in this reduction zone. The solids with higher Co loading present the greater average reduction temperatures (Table 2) and the broad signal reduction exhibit an additional small peak in the profiles of OM15Co and OM20Co. This fact is related to a change in the particle size of phase-segregated Co3O4 [10,56]. In this reduction zone, only for OM15Co and OM20Co, the amount of hydrogen consumed by the first low temperature peak was about one-third of that the others, confirming the sequential conversion of Co3O4 to CoO and CoO to Co0. On contrary, the H2 uptake of OM5Co and OM10Co suggest the presence of CoO. These results agree with XRD measurements previously discussed. The high-temperature reduction zone (600–1000°C) was assigned to the complex reduction of non-stoichiometric cobalt aluminates or Co2+/Co3+ species incorporated into the periclase-like solid solution (MgAlOx) [3,10,47], which require more energy to be reduced. For instance, the H2-TPR profile of OM5Co evidenced that 1000°C is not enough to reduce the material. According to XRD results, the solids with lower Co concentrations (5, 10%) predominantly have Co2+ phases which strongly interact with Al2O3 and MgO. This behavior is the result of the polarization of the CoO bonds by Al3+ or Mg2+ of the matrix which hinders the reduction process [57]. On the other hand, the average reduction temperature noticeably decreases with higher cobalt loading (Table 2). Larger particles of cobalt phases will be reduced first requiring low temperature while small particles into the solid solution have strong particle–support interaction, thus they need more energy to reduce [58,59]. The H2 consumption increases with the cobalt content (Table 2) resulting from the higher number of reducible sites."
9,Textural and morphological analysis of the solids,"3.4 Textural and morphological analysis of the solids The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 7 . All mixed oxides showed type IV isotherms typical of mesoporous solids, regardless of the Co content [60]. However, the hysteresis loop is different for solids. The OM5Co and OM10Co catalysts showed a H1-like hysteresis loop typical of particles crisscrossed by cylindrical channels and formed by aggregates of spheroidal particles with uniform sizes and shapes [60]. The OM15Co catalyst shows a H2-like hysteresis loop with characteristics similar to the H1-like hysteresis loop, albeit formed by aggregates of particles with heterogeneous sizes and shapes, whereas the OM20Co solid shows a H3-like hysteresis loop with slit-shaped pores formed by agglomerates of particles with uneven shapes and sizes [60,61]. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) areas of all the catalysts are listed in Table 1. The area decreases with the increase in the percentage of active phase, initially drastically from 5 to 10% Co (from 218 to 145m2/g, respectively) and then less sharply with the Co content ranging from 10 to 20% (from 145 to 118m2/g), as shown in Table 1. This may be explained by the formation of segregated Co3+ phases, which increase with the percentage of cobalt in the catalyst [20,62], as shown by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TPR, and even SEM-EDX, as discussed below. Fig. 8 shows the SEM-EDX mapping analysis performed for the elements Co, Mg, and Al present in the synthesized solids. A fairly uniform Co distribution is observed in the MgAl lattice, particularly in the catalysts with 5% and 10% Co, because such metal is mostly stabilized in the periclase-like MgAlOx solid matrix, as shown by XRD and H2-TPR. The increase in Co concentration to 15% and 20% shows the presence of agglomerates resulting from the presence of segregated Co3O4 species on the surface of the solid. This result is consistent with the loss of surface area with the increasing Co content in the catalysts."
10,Catalytic assays,"3.5 Catalytic assays Fig. 9 shows the yield of the products obtained regarding the mixed oxides assessed in the OSRE reaction. These experimental results are compared with the values generated by a thermodynamic simulation of the reaction, applying the Gibbs free energy minimization method and using ASPEN HYSYS process simulation software [63]. The following theoretical yields of H2, CO2, CO and CH4 per mol of ethanol were calculated: 3.82mol, 0.96mol, 0.82mol, and 0.21mol, respectively. All oxides assessed by OSRE showed the total ethanol conversion during the 8h of reaction because such conversion is thermodynamically favored by the conditions used; however, the active phase content clearly has a key effect on the reaction kinetics, expressed by the distribution of products and specifically by the H2 yield. The performance of a mixed MgAl oxide without Co (OM0Co), which was synthesized using the same method, was initially assessed. The solid noticeably failed to enhance H2 production and showed the formation of various subproducts: ethylene, methane, ethane, acetone, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide resulting from the thermal decomposition of ethanol [9]. Co incorporation into the MgAl oxide matrix, even at low concentrations (5%), significantly induces the formation of H2, which shows the importance of the active phase for this reaction because transition metals such as Co have partly occupied “d” orbitals that contribute to the CC bond activation and oxidation of CHx and COx fragments resulting from the strong interaction of these metals with oxygen [20]. The OM5Co catalyst has a yield of 1.80mol H2/mol ethanol. However, this result is lower than the yield calculated by simulation, which could be associated with the limited availability of active sites. Moreover, MgAl is the predominant oxidic phase in this catalyst, which promotes side reactions that induce the formation of ethylene, ethane, and oxygenates (acetaldehyde and acetone). Previous studies suggest that steam reforming of ethanol may proceed through acetate-like intermediaries and that reactions between adsorbed acetaldehyde and acetate species may occur under specific conditions (high mobility of surface oxygen species) resulting in the formation of acetone, which is reportedly a secondary product of Co catalysts [2,62]. Conversely, MgO and MgAlOx oxides are catalytically active in condensation reactions and may enhance ethanol conversion into compounds such as acetone or ethylene [64], which induce the formation of carbonaceous deposits, thus leading to catalyst deactivation [65]. Only H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 are produced when the catalyst Co concentration increases from 5% to 10% and 15%, with H2 and CH4 yields extremely similar to those calculated by simulation, which indicates high activity of CC bond breaking [2,16]. The structural properties, redox performance, and textural properties influence the excellent catalytic performance of these solids. Co2+ is the predominant species in the OM10Co catalysts, as shown by XRD. Such catalysts are more easily reduced, that is, they have better redox properties and promote reaction pathways enabling H2 production, such as those described in Eqs. (6)–(8) [18]: (6) Water-gas shift ( WGS ) H 2 O + CO ↔ H 2 + CO 2 (7) Acetaldehyde reforming CH 3 CHO + H 2 O → 3 H 2 + 2 CO (8) Steam reforming of methane CH 4 + H 2 O ↔ 3 H 2 + CO Based on the catalytic performance of OM10Co and OM15Co, it can be suggest that a Co content ranging from 10 to 15% is optimal for OSRE. However, the possibility of deactivation by surface carbon or coke deposition cannot be neglected. Carbon may block access of reactants to metal surface sites, encapsulate and deactivate a metal particle, and, in extreme cases, stress and fracture the material [19,22]. In addition, it has been reported that the effect of coke or carbon formed in catalytic processes differ with operation conditions and the reaction and catalyst type. For instance, it has been proposed that the structure and location of those deposits are more important than its quantity [66]. In this context, Raman spectroscopy and TEM characterization were used to evidence carbon formation in all materials. The results of OM10 were selected due to its physicochemical properties. Fig. 10 shows the Raman spectrum of the OM10Co catalyst after the reaction. The 1300cm−1 band, known as the D band, and the band near 1600cm−1, known as the G band, are both typical of materials with carbonaceous structures [67]. The G band is related to the sp2 bond energy and indicates highly structured graphitic materials [68]. The band at 1300cm−1,known as the D band, is usually generated in graphitic materials with less ordered structures, associated with defective graphite structures. The relationship between the G and D band intensities has been suggested to indicate the degree of crystallinity, thus establishing that this catalyst has a higher proportion of structured carbon [68]. TEM images of the OM10Co catalyst after the reaction was presented in Fig. 11 . The formation of ordered tubular structures like fibers that extending beyond the particles of the catalyst can be observed. The dark dots correspond to metallic particles of the material (Co0), which were generated with the reduction pretreatment or in situ due the nature of the reaction atmosphere. It is also observed that carbon filaments contained the Co particle at the end which might well the stable activity for the catalysts because there was no blocking of the active sites. Furthermore, there is no significant increase in the particle size in this solid. Conversely, the H2 yield decreases to 3.39mol H2/mol ethanol, and the methane production doubles when using the OM20Co catalyst in the OSRE reaction, which may be explained by the presence of high concentrations of Co3O4 in this catalyst and the agglomeration of these species shown by XRD, H2-TPR, and SEM-EDX. The H2 generated in situ in the reaction is most likely consumed to reduce Co3+ species to Co2+ and subsequently to Co0, thereby decreasing the H2 yield."
11,Conclusions,"Catalysts prepared from hydrotalcites synthesized by ultrasound-assisted coprecipitation had particles averaging 4nm in size and were well distributed. The percentage of active phase (Co) had a direct effect on the structural, redox, textural, and catalytic properties of the mixed oxides. H2 production using Co catalysts follows the following order: OM5Co<OM20Co<OM15Co=OM10Co. The OM10Co and OM15Co catalysts showed H2 yields similar to those calculated using a thermodynamic simulation. Such results suggest that a Co content ranging from 10 to 15% is optimal for OSRE, whereas higher Co concentrations enhance particle agglomeration and the presence of Co3+ species and decrease the surface area. Few active sites are available at Co concentrations lower than 10%, which leads to the formation of undesirable products, including ethylene, ethane, and oxygenates (acetaldehyde and acetone) that cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Conversely, excess active phase (Co) leads to the agglomeration of Co3+ species, which have poor activity in OSRE and are also responsible for increasing the particle size and nucleation of the CHX species that cause catalyst deactivation."
