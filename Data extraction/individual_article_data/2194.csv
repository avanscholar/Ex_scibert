0,Introduction,"Bioethanol is an alcohol produced from a renewable biomass [1,2]. It has been used for blended gasoline that helps to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The production of bioethanol reached 8 × 1010 liters in 2017 [3]. This value exceeds the general consumption of bioethanol as a gasoline additive (5 × 1010 liters). Therefore, ethanol can be considered as a platform molecule for the production of valuable chemicals, such as buta-1,3-diene [4,5], dimethylbenzene [6], ethyl ethanoate [1–3], C3+ hydrocarbons [7,8], and α-alcohols (butan-1-ol and hexan-1-ol) [9,10]. Butan-1-ol and hexan-1-ol have been used in perfume, medicinal chemistry, and petrochemistry. The industrial production of these alcohols is a two-stage process involving fossil hydrocarbons. The process includes hydroformylation of alkenes followed by hydrogenation of the resulting aldehydes. Alternatively, butan-1-ol and hexan-1-ol can be directly produced from bioethanol in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst. Two general approaches are described below. Approach (I) implies heating of ethanol at 350−450 °C in the presence of oxide catalysts [1–5,11,12]. Under these conditions, direct coupling reaction takes place via dehydration involving the OH group of one C2H5OH molecule and the hydrogen atom of the β-C–H bond of a second C2H5OH molecule (Fig. 1 ). This gives butan-1-ol and water. Hexan-1-ol can be produced in a similar way from a mixture of C2H5OH and C4H9OH. The dehydration is catalyzed by acid sites, while basic sites are required for scission of the β-C–H bond. Thus, typical catalysts used in approach (I) are amphoteric oxides and modified zeolites [1–5,13]. Representative examples are given below. The Rb/NaX zeolite converts 20 % of ethanol to α-alcohols with 37 % selectivity at 420 °C [14]. The K/Al2O3 and MgO catalysts convert 50 % of ethanol to α-alcohols with 3 and 18 % selectivities at 450 °C [15]. The MgO-Al2O3 catalyst converts 33 % of ethanol to butan-1-ol with 36 % selectivity at 350 °C [16]. Thus, the performance of oxide catalysts is moderate. Also, Cosimo et al. reported that MgO-Al2O3 catalysts lost 50 % of their activity after 10 h on stream [17]. Ndou et al. reported that MgO oxide lost about 20 % of its activity after 7 h on stream [15]. The deactivation was attributed to modification of acid-base sites of the catalysts by organic oxygenates that are formed in side reactions at 350−450 °C. Bearing in mind that high temperatures are always required for the rapture of the β-C–H bond of alcohols, practical application of approach (I) to produceα-alcohols seems to be illusive. Approach (II) implies heating of ethanol at 200−300 °C in the presence of supported catalysts. In this case, sequential reactions take place: ethanol dehydrogenation to ethanal; and condensation of ethanal to 2-but-2-enal; hydrogenation of 2-but-2-enal to butanal and/or 2-buten-1-ol, which are hydrogenated to butan-1-ol (Fig. 1). Hexan-1-ol can be produced from C2H5OH and C4H9OH via a similar route. Dehydrogenation and hydrogenation are redox processes usually catalyzed by metals, whereas aldol crotonic condensation is an acid-base process catalyzed by oxides [11,18]. Obviously, effective catalysts for approach (II) should contain a metal and an oxide. The performance of these catalysts is surveyed in Ref. [1–5,11–13]. Some examples are given below. The M/MgO-Al2O3 catalysts (M = Pd, Ag, Cu, Fe, Sm) were studied in the conversion of ethanol at 200 °C [19]. The best results were obtained for the 5%Pd/MgO-Al2O3 catalyst. It converts 12 % of ethanol to butan-1-ol with 72 % selectivity. The M/Al2O3 catalysts (M = Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ni) were studied in Ref. [20,21]. At 250 °C, the best results were obtained for the 20 % Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. It converts 25 % of ethanol to α-alcohols with 80 % selectivity [20]. According to the above data, the production of α-alcohols by the second approach in the presence of monometallic M/Al2O3 or M/MgO-Al2O3 (M = Pd, Ni) catalysts is more promising, because higher selectivity and yield can be obtained at a lower reaction temperature. From the other hand, monometallic supported catalysts developed for the second approach possess low durability that can be explained by deactivation of their active sites during catalysis [9,20]. For example, due to decarbonylation of reaction intermediates (Fig. 1, R-CHO) on metal sites, CO molecules are produced [11,12,20,22]. Adsorption of CO molecules on metal sites results in a formation of metal carbonyls that do not participate in dehydrogenation-hydrogenation steps (Fig. 1). As a result, monometallic catalysts demonstrate low time-on stream performance [9,20]. There are also reports concerning deactivation of M/Al2O3 catalysts caused by sintering of metal particles at 250–400 ○C [9,23,24]. Thus, the practical application of approach (II) requires thorough design of new supported catalysts that would be resistant against CO poisoning and sintering of metal particles under reaction conditions. Herein, bimetallic catalysts could be a solution. There are a few reports demonstrating the advantages of bimetallic catalysts in conversion of ethanol to α-alcohols. The Ni-Cu/MgO-Al2O3 catalyst (Ni = 7.5 wt.%, Cu = 8.2 wt.%) was studied in Ref. [23]. This sample contained a NiCu alloy, which is known to suppress cleavage of CC bonds and thus helps to reduce the amount of CO generated from ethanal in situ. As a result, stable 76 % selectivity to α-alcohols was observed in recycling tests at 270 °C. However, due to sintering of the NiCu alloy, a decrease in ethanol conversion was also observed. The Cu-CeO2/C catalyst (Cu = 10 wt.%, Ce = 20 wt.%) with redox (Cu) and acid-base (CeO2) sites was studied in Ref. [22]. This sample demonstrated higher resistance to sintering. As a result, stable conversion of ethanol (46 %) was observed at 250 ○C. Due to low activity of Cu and CeO2 towards decarbonylation of ethanal, the undesired CO molecules were not detected in products. Meanwhile, the low activity of Cu towards hydrogenation of reaction intermediates resulted in a low selectivity to α-alcohols (40 %). The Au-MOx/Al2O3 (M = Fe, Co, Ag) samples were studied in Ref. [9]. Herein, modification of gold with MOx species gives mixed particles containing 3-nm Au° phase, which is known to selectively catalyze hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions required in approach (II). As compared with conventional metals (Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), gold is known to be less deactivated upon chemisorption of CO molecules generated in side reactions. Also, Au-MOx compositions demonstrate high resistance to sintering. As a result, for the most promising Au-FeOx/Al2O3 (Au = 0.2 wt.%, Fe = 0.06 wt.%) catalyst, reproducible ethanol conversion of 21 % with 70 % selectivity to butan-1-ol was observed at 275 °C. Thus, the bimetallic catalysts possess high potential for upgrading the conversion of ethanol to α-alcohols. However, the composition of the most effective samples is still under development. In the present paper, we report a study of the catalytic conversion of ethanol in the presence of PdxCuy (x = 40 mol.%, y =60 mol.%) nanoalloy supported on Al2O3. To the best of our knowledge, this system has not been tested in the conversion of ethanol to heavier α-alcohols, but we expect it to be effective for a number of reasons. They are listed below. The sites of Al2O3 are suitable for acid-base catalysis, which is required for aldol crotonic condensation of ethanal [9]. Zero-valence Pd is one of the most active catalysts for hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions. Next, modification of Pd with Cu in Pd40Cu60 particles was reported to increase the resistance of the Pd component to CO poisoning via ligand effect [25,26]. Finally, there are reports concerning the SMSI effect in alloyed catalysts, which decreases sintering of Pd-containing particles under reaction conditions [27,28]. Consequently, the application of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst for the conversion of ethanol to α-alcohols at 200−300 °C should be beneficial in terms of stability, selectivity, and activity. In order to reach the goal of the current study, the model PdCu/Al2O3 nanocomposite (Pd = 0.1 wt.%, Cu = 0.1 wt.%, molar ratio [Pd]:[Cu] = 40:60) was produced by combination of deposition-precipitation (DP) and impregnation (IMP) methods [25]. These methods are well-known, simple and can be easily scaled to the large-capacity production of the catalysts. Also, they allow producing PdCu alloy particles [25]. The chosen metal contents are also typical of commercial catalysts. Note that during preparation of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst, three metal structures were formed, in particular, PdCu particles (73 %) and individual Pd and Cu particles (27 %). Accordingly, to elucidate the contribution of the supported bimetallic structures to the overall activity of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst, the samples containing Pd and Cu particles (0.1 %Pd/Al2O3 and 0.1 %Cu/Al2O3) were also prepared and studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of catalysts The parent Pd/Al2O3* solid (Pd = 0.1 wt.%) was prepared by DP [25]. In a typical procedure, a calculated amount of Pd(NO3)2×2H2O containing 9.4 × 10−5 mol of palladium was dissolved in 50 mL of water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.0 by addition of 0.1 M NaOH. 10 g of Al2O3 (Angarsk Plant of Catalysts and Organic Synthesis; S = 160 m2/g; granule size, 0.5 mm) was added to the solution. The resulting suspension was stirred at 70 °C for 1 h. Next, the Pd/Al2O3* solid was separated, washed with 5 L of hot water, dried for 24 h, calcined at 350 °C for 1 h, and used for the synthesis of the Pd-containing catalysts. The PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst (Pd = 0.1 wt.%, Cu = 0.1 wt.%) was prepared by IMP of Pd/Al2O3*. In a typical procedure, 5 g of Pd/Al2O3* was impregnated with 5.5 mL of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2×6H2O containing 7.8 × 10−5 mol of copper, dried for 24 h, calcined at 350 °C for 2 h and reduced with H2 at 150 °C for 2 h. To produce the reference Pd/Al2O3 catalyst (Pd = 0.1 wt.%), 5 g of Pd/Al2O3* was calcined at 350 °C for 2 h and reduced with H2 at 150 °C for 2 h. The reference Cu/Al2O3 catalyst (Cu = 0.1 wt.%) was produced by IMP of Al2O3 with 5.5 mL of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2×6H2O containing 7.8 × 10−5 mol of copper followed by drying for 24 h, calcination at 350 °C for 3 h, and reduction with H2 at 150 °C for 2 h. The overall treatment for the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst and the reference Pd/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts comprised 3 h at 350 °C in air and 2 h at 150 °C in H2. This allows a valid comparison of the catalytic properties of the supported mono- and bimetallic structures. Between the experiments, the catalysts were stored in a box filled with dry argon. The metal content in the initial catalysts was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy with a relative error of 5% on a Thermo iCE 3000 instrument as described in Ref. [29]. The actual Pd and Cu contents in the PdCu catalyst were 0.096 ± 0.005 wt.% and 0.102 ± 0.005 wt.%. These values are close to the desired metal contents corresponding to the [Pd]:[Cu] molar ratio of 40:60. The metal contents in the Pd/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts were 0.096 ± 0.005 and 0.098 ± 0.005 wt.%, respectively. The metal contents in the spent catalysts were close to those in the initial samples."
3,Characterization of the catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of the catalysts Morphological analysis was carried out on a JEOL JEM-2100 F/UHR microscope with a 0.1-nm resolution. The analyzed sample was prepared by ultrasonic dispersion of the catalyst granules (0.2 g) in ethanol (10 ml) followed by deposition of a drop of the suspension on a carbon-coated Ni grid. The spots visible in the TEM images were assigned to metal-containing particles using energy dispersive X–ray spectroscopy (EDS) with application of a JED–2300 X–ray spectrometer. The size of a particle was defined as the maximum linear dimension. For each catalyst, 300 to 380 particles were processed to determine the particle size distribution. The relative contents of individual and bimetallic particles in the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst were determined by statistical analysis of TEM-EDS data obtained for 200 random particles. The lattice d-spacings for planes visible in the high-resolution TEM images (HRTEM) on the surface of metal particles were measured with application of electron diffraction patterns as described in Ref. [25]. ImageJ 1.47 software was used for this purpose. The assignment of the lattice d-spacings to planes of the chemical compound was performed with application of JCPDS database and verified by the distance ratios and angles for the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of different copper and palladium species. The diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were recorded using an InfraLUM FT-801 Fourier spectrometer equipped with a diffuse-reflectance attachment with 4 cm−1 resolution in the range from 900 to 6000 cm−1 [30]. In a typical experiment, 0.04 g of the catalyst containing 1.2 × 10-4 g of palladium and/or copper was loaded into the DRIFT cell (quartz reactor with a finger and CaF2 optical window). The cell was connected to a vacuum system, heated in a vacuum at 350 °C for 2 h, and cooled to 25 °C. Then the cell was connected to a spectrometer, and a background spectrum (A) was recorded. After recording the background spectrum, the cell with the catalyst was connected to a vacuum system equipped with a CO reservoir, and equilibrium CO pressure (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 kPa) was generated in the cell at 25 °C. Next, the cell was connected to a spectrometer, and then spectra (B) were recorded. Spectra (C) were recorded after outgassing the cell containing heat-treated catalyst at a CO pressure of 0.1 kPa at 25 and at 80 °C, which corresponds to residual CO pressures of 0.002 and 0.001 kPa. The spectra for analysis were obtained by subtracting spectrum A from spectrum B or C. The spectra were plotted as CO adsorption (Kubelka–Munk units) vs the wavenumber (cm-1 units). The acidity of the catalysts was measured by temperature programmed desorption of NH3 (TPD-NH3) [31]. For this purpose, the catalyst granules (0.2 g) were loaded in a quartz reactor and treated in situ at 400 ○C in a flow of dry He for 1 h. The reactor was cooled to 25 °C and then the adsorption of NH3 was conducted at ambient temperature in a flow of NH3 diluted with N2 (1:1). The complete saturation of the sample with NH3 was reached within 30 min. Next, the weakly bound NH3 was removed in a flow of dry He at 100 ○C for 1 h and the reactor was cooled to 25 °C. The TPD-NH3 experiment was carried out in a flow of dry He (30 ml/min), with the temperature being ramped from 25 to 700 ○C at a rate of 8 ○C/min. The desorbed NH3 was detected by a TC detector. The amount of desorbed NH3 was calculated from the TPD-NH3 spectrum using pre-constructed calibration curves. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) of the catalysts was carried out on a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with Ni-filtered CuKα radiation and a LYNXEYE detector. The sample for analysis was prepared by mechanical dispersion of the catalyst granules (0.8 g). The diffraction data were collected in the 2θ range from 35 to 60○ with a step of 0.02○."
4,Catalytic conversion of ethanol,"2.3 Catalytic conversion of ethanol Ethanol conversion was carried out on a Parr 5000 Series multiple reactor system under the optimum reaction conditions that were determined earlier [9,10]. In a standard run, ethanol (25 mL) and the catalyst (5.6 g) were loaded into a reactor (45 mL). The reactor was sealed and filled with argon. Next, argon was pumped out. The reactor was heated to 275 °C and stirred at 1600 rpm for 5 h. After completion of each experiment, the C1–C5 hydrocarbons were analyzed on a Kristal 4000 M instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector and an HPPLOT column; CO, CO2, H2, and H2O were analyzed on a Kristal 4000 M instrument with a TC detector and an SKT column. Analysis of liquid organic compounds was performed on an Agilent MSD 6973 instrument with a FID and an HP-5MS column. Quantitative analysis of organic compounds was performed on a Varian 3600 instrument (Chromatec column; SE-30; 0.25 × 250 cm; Df =0.3 mm; 50 °C (5 min); 10 °C/min; 280 °C; tinj =250 °C; Pinj =1 bar; 1/200 split ratio; FID; n-octane as internal standard). The conversion (α) was calculated as α = [C2H5OH)i-(C2H5OH)f] × (C2H5OH)i −1 × 100, where (C2H5OH)f is the amount of ethanol in the reaction mixture after catalysis (moles) and (C2H5OH)i is the initial amount of ethanol (moles). The selectivity (Si ) to an organic compound (i) was calculated on a per carbon basis [7] and was defined as Si = N/2 × ni × [(C2H5OH)i – (C2H5OH)f]−1, where [(C2H5OH)i – (C2H5OH)f] is the amount of ethanol converted (moles); ni is the quantity of the i-th component (moles); N is the number of carbon atoms in an organic compound (i). The yield (ηi ) of an organic compound (i) was calculated as ηi = α × Si × 100−1. The relative error in determination of α, S, and η was ± 5%. The activity (A1) of the catalyst towards α-alcohol formation was calculated as A1 = ν1 × t−1 × m−1, where ν1 is the amount of butan-1-ol and hexan-1-ol in the reaction mixture after catalysis (moles), t is the reaction time (h), and m is the amount of catalyst granules (grams). The activity (A2) of the catalyst towards major by-product formation was calculated as A2 = ν2 × t−1 × m−1, where ν2 is the amount of ethoxyethane in the reaction mixture after catalysis (moles), t is the reaction time (h), and m is the amount of catalyst granules (grams). The activities were calculated from the initial linear segment of kinetic curves at low ethanol conversions (3–10 %). The relative error in determination of A1 and A2 values was ± 8%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,XRD and TPD-NH3 measurements,"3.1 XRD and TPD-NH3 measurements The XRD patterns of the Al2O3 support are presented in Fig. S1. Three diffraction peaks at 2θ of 37.5, 39.5, and 46.0 ○ are observed, and they are attributable to the (311), (222), and (400) planes of alumina (JCPDS card No.29-0063). The similar peaks were observed for the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. S1) and its monometallic analogues. No peaks of the Pd or Cu species were found during XRD analysis. This latter result is rather typical of XRD analysis of nanocomposites containing 0.1−0.2 wt.% of the supported metal. It could be explained by high degree of dispersion of the metal particles and/or relatively low metal content in the supported catalysts [25,30]. A TPD-NH3 curve for the Al2O3 support is shown in Fig. S2. A broad peak at about 200−300 ○C is attributable to the sites exhibiting weak and medium acid properties [19,32]. The total acidity of Al2O3 is 230 ± 10 μmol × g−1. The TPD-NH3 curves for the PdCu/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts are presented in Fig. S2. The TPD-NH3 profiles of these catalysts are similar to the TPD-NH3 profile of Al2O3. The total acidity of the catalysts is 227 ± 10 μmol × g−1, which is close to the total acidity of Al2O3. The obtained results indicate that deposition of 0.1 wt.% of Pd and/or 0.1 wt.% of Cu species does not modify the chemical properties of the support. This is a promising result, because Al2O3 sites are required for the condensation of reaction intermediates [9]."
7,TEM-EDS measurements,"3.2 TEM-EDS measurements Black spherical spots can be seen in the TEM image of the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. S3(a). The EDS spectrum of these spots exhibits peaks corresponding to C, Ni, Al, O, and Cu elements (Fig. S3(b)). Ni and C elements are attributable to the TEM grid. The rest combination of elements indicates that the spots seen in the TEM image are due to Cu-containing particles deposited on Al2O3. After identification of the locations of Cu-containing particles, the HRTEM images of their surface were obtained (Fig. 2 ). The surface of the Cu-containing particles possesses planes with the lattice spacings of 2.07 Å. This value can be assigned to Cu(111) planes of the copper metal FCC structure (JCPDS card #04-0836). In order to verify this suggestion, the FCC lattice constant (a) was calculated as: a = d(hkl) × (h2 + k2 + l2)1/2, where a is the FCC lattice constant; h, k, l are the Miller indices for the (111) plane; and d is the lattice spacing measured from the HRTEM images. The calculated lattice constant is 3.56 Å, which is close to that of Cu metal (3.61 Å). The size of the Cu-containing particles is 1–10 nm, and the average size is 4 ± 1 nm (Fig. 3 ). The shape of the particle size distribution and the average particle size for the spent catalyst are similar to those for the initial catalyst (Fig. 3). No sintering of the copper phase was observed during catalysis. The absence of sintering of the supported metal particles is explained by preliminary calcination of the catalyst at 350 ○C. This temperature is higher than that used in the reaction (275 ○C). The TEM image of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst contains dark round spots (Fig. S4(a)). According to EDS data, these spots can be assigned to Pd-containing particles (Fig. S4(b)). The surface of the Pd-containing particles possesses planes with lattice spacings of 2.25 Å (Fig. 4 ). The calculated FCC lattice constant is 3.89 Å, which is close to that of Pd metal (3.89 Å). The size of the Pd-containing particles is 2–18 nm, and the average particle size is 9 ± 2 nm (Fig. 5 ). The average particle size for the spent catalyst is similar to that for the fresh catalyst (Fig. 5). An example of TEM-EDS map for the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst is shown in Fig. S5. It illustrates the presence of three types of particles formed during the preparation of the PdCu/Al2O3: individual Cu and Pd particles and PdCu particles. According to statistical analysis of TEM-EDS data, the relative contents of mono- and bimetallic particles were 27 % and 73 %, respectively. Thus, the simple methods chosen in the present study ensure a rather high yield of supported bimetallic particles even at low metal contents (i.e., Pd = 0.1 wt.%, Cu = 0.1 wt.%). The HRTEM image of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst is presented in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that the size and structure of individual Pd and Cu particles of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst resemble those for its monometallic analogues (cf. Figs. 6, 2 and 4). According to statistical analysis of TEM-EDS data, the size of bimetallic particles in the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst was determined as 4 ± 2 nm (Fig. 6). The HRTEM image of a single PdCu particle is presented in Fig. 7 (a). The structure of PdCu particle can be indexed as an FCC structure, as depicted in the inset in Fig. 7(a). The lattice spacings for the (200) and (111) planes, visible on the particle surface, are 1.86 and 2.15 Å, respectively. The calculated FCC lattice constant is 3.72 Å, which is between those of the metallic Pd and Cu, suggesting the possibility of an alloy formation [25]. The composition of the hypothetical alloy was calculated using the Vegard's law: a(PdCu)=(1-x) × a(Cu) + x × a(Pd), where a(PdCu) is the lattice constant of the hypothetical alloy measured from the HRTEM image, а(Pd) and a(Cu) are the lattice constants for metallic Pd and Cu, and x is the Pd mole fraction in the alloy. According to calculations, the Pd and Cu contents in the alloy are 41 and 59 mol.%, respectively. These values are consistent with EDS data obtained for the PdCu particle (Fig. 7(b)). According to the EDS spectrum presented in Fig. 7(b), the Pd to Cu mass ratio is 50:50 (i.e., Pd to Cu molar ratio is 38:62). The particle size distribution for the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst before and after the reaction is presented in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that the average particle size in the spent PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst is similar to that in the initial PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The main results of morphological analysis can be summarized as follows: 1) the average size of metal particles in the reference Cu/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts is 4 ± 1 and 9 ± 2 nm, respectively; 2) the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst is composed of Cu and Pd particles (27 %) and bimetallic particles (73 %); 3) the size of monometallic particles of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst resembles those for its monometallic analogues; 4) the size of bimetallic particles in the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst is 4 ± 2 nm; 5) the bimetallic particles consist of an alloy with the FCC structure and the Pd to Cu molar ratio is close to 40:60; 6) the supported metal particles in the catalysts are resistant to sintering under reaction conditions."
8,DRIFT measurements,"3.3 DRIFT measurements The DRIFT spectroscopy provides useful information about the electronic and adsorptive properties of “surface” atoms in metal particles, because adsorption of CO molecules on different metal-containing sites produces bands of specific metal carbonyls in DRIFT spectra. Note that features of bands visible in DRIFT spectrum depend on the surface CO coverage. Accordingly, the spectra of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst and its monometallic analogues were recorded at a relatively high CO pressure (0.1−0.5 kPa) and after thermal outgassing to low CO pressure (0.001−0.002 kPa). The obtained spectra are presented in Figs. 9–11 , and their features are discussed below. No bands for Pdn+–CO in 2150−2180 cm−1 region [33,34] are observed in the spectra of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 9(a)-(d)). This result is indicative of complete reduction of metal species on the surface of Pd particles during treatment of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst with H2 at 150 ○C. At high CO coverage, the spectrum of Pd/Al2O3 exhibits bands at about 2086 and 1958 cm−1 (Fig. 9(a)) These bands are assignable to linearly bonded (ν = 2050−2100 cm−1) and bridge-bonded (ν = 1800−2000 cm−1) Pd°-CO that are formed on the surface of Pd nanoparticles [35,36]. A decrease in CO coverage results in an expected decrease of integral intensity of bands corresponding to Pd carbonyls (Fig. 9(a)-(d)). Also, a red shift of Pd°-CO bands by 19–38 cm−1 is observed (Fig. 9(a)-(d)). This shift is a known phenomenon induced by changes in lateral interactions between adsorbed CO molecules, as the adsorbate layer becomes less and less dense [35,37]. At high CO coverages, CO adsorption on Cu/Al2O3 produces a single band of linearly bonded Cu carbonyls at about 2129 cm−1 (Fig. 10(a)). The bridge-bonded Cu carbonyls are not formed at room temperature [34], consequently, they are not presented in Fig. 10. A decrease in CO coverage results in a decrease of integral intensity of the band corresponding to linearly bonded Cu carbonyls and a slight shift of this band to 2126 cm−1 (Fig. 10(a)-(e)). Similar trends were already observed in the DRIFT spectra of the Pd/Al2O3 sample. They are discussed in the paragraph above. The assignment of the band observed at 2126−2129 cm−1 in the DRIFT spectra of the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst to a certain Cu oxidation state is by no means unambiguous. This band can be assigned to linearly bonded Cu+–CO formed on the surface of large copper particles (ν = 2080−2160 cm−1) and/or Cu°–CO formed on the surface of copper nanoparticles (ν = 2100−2130 cm−1) [33,34,38,39]. Bearing in mind that the size of Cu particles in Cu/Al2O3 is 4 nm, the assignment of the 2126−2129 cm−1 band to Cu°–CO situated on the surface of nanoparticles sounds reasonable. In other words, the surface of Cu particles in the Cu/Al2O3 sample consists of Cu° atoms. Nevertheless, let the band observed at about 2130 cm−1 is attributable to Cu+ carbonyls [34] and the band observed at about 2100 cm−1 is attributable to Cu° carbonyls [34]. Assuming such model, the [Cu°] and [Cu+] amounts on the surface of copper particles in Cu/Al2O3 catalyst can be calculated from peak areas after decomposing the DRIFT spectrum into two components. An example of such decomposition is presented in Fig. S6. It gives the [Cu°] content at about 70 at.% and [Cu+] content at about 30 at.%. Thus, Cu° is again the main oxidation state of copper in the Cu/Al2O3 sample. At high CO coverage, CO adsorption on PdCu/Al2O3 produces three bands at about 2126, 2086, and 1958 cm−1 (Fig. 11(a)). According to the above discussion, the positions of these bands indicate the presence of Pd° and Cu° atoms in the bimetallic catalyst. Thus, the main oxidation states of metals in the bimetallic catalyst correspond to those observed in monometallic analogues. A decrease in CO coverage results in decreasing integral intensity of bands corresponding to metal carbonyls accompanied by a red shift of these bands. Similar trends were also observed in the DRIFT spectra of monometallic samples. In comparison with Cu/Al2O3, a lower amount of Cu carbonyls is produced on the surface of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst at a particular CO pressure (cf. intensity of band at about 2126−2129 cm−1, Figs. 10 and 11). This is a trivial effect, which can be explained by preferential adsorption of CO on Pd sites present in the PdCu catalyst. It is known that CO adsorption on Pd surface is stronger than that on Cu surface [26,40,41]. For example, desorption of CO molecules from the surface of Cu(111) plane results in a TDS peak at 170 K, equivalent to CO binding energy in the range of 0.46–0.52 eV [26,41]. Desorption of CO molecules from the Pd(111) plane results in a high-temperature TDS peak at 500 K, equivalent to CO binding energy in the range of 1.47–1.54 eV [26,42]. The increased activity of Pd towards CO binding can be explained by the d-band model proposed by Nørskov et al. [43]. According to this model, there is a correlation between the position of metal d-band center relative to the Fermi level (εd) and its activity to form M–CO bond via electron donation from metal d orbitals to CO 2π* orbital. The εd(Cu) value for the Cu(111) plane is –2.7 eV, and the εd(Pd) values for the Pd(111) and PdCu(111) planes are –1.8 and –2.5 eV, respectively [26,43]. These values indicate a lower down-shift of Pd d-band center from the Fermi level. Consequently, the preferential CO adsorption on Pd sites of Pd(111) and PdCu(111) planes should be expected. In comparison with Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, the amount of Pd carbonyls produced on the surface of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst at a particular CO pressure is also decreased. This effect is more pronounced at low CO pressure (cf. intensity of bands at about 2062 cm−1 and at about 1920−1930 cm−1 in Figs. 9 and 11(d)). The decreased ability of Pd sites of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst to bind CO can be explained by the “ligand effect” induced by modification of Pd electronic structure upon alloying with Cu. Herein, some data should be discussed. In comparison with Pd particles, a 0.4 eV down-shift of palladium d-band center was observed for Pd/Cu alloy particles [44]. The εd(Pd) values in the Pd(111) and PdCu(111) planes were reported to be –1.8 and –2.5 eV, respectively [26,45]. Thus, the down-shift of Pd d-band center in PdCu systems is observed. According to the d-band model [43], the down-shift of Pd d-band center in PdCu alloy should decrease the ability of Pd sites to bind CO [43]. This was confirmed by DFT study in Ref. [26]. The CO binding energies for top Pd and bridging Pd2 sites of Pd(111) were found to be 1.4 eV and 1.8 eV, and CO binding energies for top Pd and bridging Pd2 sites of PdCu(111) were found to be 0.7 eV and 1.0 eV. Thus, the ligand effect brings a decreased ability of Pd sites to form both linear and bridge-bonded Pd carbonyls in PdCu systems. The “ensemble effect” that is observed after dilution of the surface of an active metal by a less active metal can also contribute to the decreased ability of palladium in the PdCu particles to form bridge-bonded Pd carbonyls. Herein, some facts should be taken into consideration. In Pd/Al2O3, bridge-bonded Pd carbonyls are formed on Pd2 and Pd3 sites situated on the surface of palladium particles (-Pd-Pd-Pd-Pd-Pd-). According to TEM-EDS of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst that was produced via copper modification of Pd/Al2O3, the major fraction of PdCu/Al2O3 particles consists of PdCu alloy particles. The surface of alloy particles can be described as (-Cu-Pd-Cu-Pd-Cu-). Herein, the distance between the nearby Pd atoms is increased, resulting in a decreased ability of new Pd2 and Pd3 sites of alloy particles to form strong multiple bonds with CO molecules [34,43]. The main results of DRIFT analysis can be summarized as follows: 1) the oxidation state of palladium in the Pd/Al2O3 and PdCu/Al2O3 catalysts is Pd0; 2) the main oxidation state of copper in the Cu/Al2O3 and PdCu/Al2O3 catalysts is Cu0; 3) palladium sites situated on the surface of alloy particles in the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst possess lower activity towards CO binding."
9,Kinetic features of ethanol conversion,"3.4 Kinetic features of ethanol conversion According to TEM-EDS analysis, the surface of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst can be is composed of three elements: PdCu, Pd, and Cu particles deposited on alumina. Note that the bare Al2O3 surface can also be found in the bimetallic catalyst. Obviously, each element may participate in catalytic conversion of ethanol in a standard run (i.e. 275 ○C, 5 h). In order to elucidate the overall performance of deposited alloy particles towards α-alcohol formation, the catalytic properties of Pd/Al2O3, Cu/Al2O3, and Al2O3 samples should be analyzed and compared with that for the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst. In the range from 0 h to 5 h, the major product accumulated in the reaction mixture on Al2O3 is ethoxyethane (Fig. 12 ). This compound is formed via dehydration of ethanol on acid sites of the solids [3]. The amount of ethoxyethane measured after 5 h of the reaction accounts for 95 % of the products formed. The minor products include butan-1-ol, hexan-1-ol, ethoxybutane, and C1-C4 compounds such as CnH2n+2 and CnH2n, (n = 1–4). These molecules are formed from ethanol via known organic reactions described elsewhere [1–4]. The amount of minor products measured after 5 h of the reaction accounts for 0.2−0.7% of the products formed. Trace amounts of side C5+ hydrocarbons of different structure were also detected. No common intermediates of mechanism (II) such as ethanal, 2-buten-1-ol, or butanal were observed. This indicates that the general route of α-alcohol formation is direct condensation of ethanol molecules (Fig. 1). The A1 activity of the Al2O3 towards α-alcohol formation is 0.04 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1, and the A2 activity towards ethoxyethane formation is 4.5 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1 (Table 1 , run 1). This indicates that the overall performance of Al2O3 in the target process is low. The catalytic behavior observed for the Al2O3 is consistent with the results of Kozlowski et al. [11] and Gabriëls et al. [12]. They reported that temperatures of 350−450 ○C are required for a high activity of the oxide catalysts in ethanol conversion to α-alcohols. In the range from 0 h to 5 h, the qualitative composition of products and rates of their accumulation in the presence of the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst are similar to those observed for the Al2O3 sample (cf Figs. 12 and 13 ). The A1 activity of the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst is 0.05 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1 and the A2 activity is 5.5 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1 (Table 1, run 1). Thus, the target process proceeds at a low rate, while the side reaction giving ethoxyethane is fast. The absence of intermediates corresponding to mechanism (II) indicates that α-alcohols are formed upon direct condensation of ethanol molecules, while mechanism (II) is not implemented. This can be explained by low activity of metallic copper towards hydrogenation-dehydrogenation steps of mechanism (II) at 275 ○C and/or by a relatively low metal content in the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst (i.e. 0.1 wt.%). In the range from 0 h to 3 h, the major products formed in the presence of Pd/Al2O3 are butan-1-ol and hexan-1-ol (Fig. 14 ). The amount of α-alcohols measured after 3 h of the reaction accounts for 80 % of the products formed. The major by-product is still ethoxyethane, but its amount is significantly lower (≈ 10 %). The minor products formed in the presence of Pd/Al2O3 include ethoxybutane, C5+, and C1-C4 compounds such as CnH2n+2, CnH2n, and CO (n = 1–4). The amount of minor products accounts for 0.4–1.5 % of the products formed. The initial segments of the kinetic curves for Pd/Al2O3 demonstrate fast accumulation of butan-1-ol accompanied by ethoxyethane and hexan-1-ol formation at moderate rates (Fig. 14, τ = 1−3 h). The A1 activity of Pd/Al2O3 is 55.6 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1and the A2 activity is 6.1 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1 (Table 1, run 1). Thus, the overall performance of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst towards the target process is high. According to GH-MS analysis, trace amounts of ethanal and butanal molecules were detected in the reaction media during conversion of ethanol in the presence of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 14). Consequently, the reaction sequence of mechanism (II), starting from dehydrogenation of ethanol to ethanal on Pd° sites followed by aldol crotonic condensation on Al2O3 sites and subsequent hydrogenation of reaction intermediate to α-alcohol on Pd° sites sounds reasonable for Pd/Al2O3. Note that the ethanal concentrations seem to peak in early stages of the reaction and then to sharply decrease (Fig. 14). A similar kinetic trend was observed by Rittonen et al. over the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst [20]. The authors of the cited study reported that ethanal can be regarded as the key intermediate. In the range from 3 h to 5 h, the kinetic curves for Pd/Al2O3 demonstrate a pronounced decrease in the amount of α-alcohols (Fig. 14). This result can be explained by deactivation of Pd0 sites. Herein, four possible causes can be proposed: oxidation of the palladium phase; formation of soluble organometallic compounds; sintering of Pd particles, and chemisorption of CO produced via side reaction on the Pd particle surface. The first cause can be ruled out, as the reaction was carried out in the absence of oxygen. The second cause can be ruled out too, as the metal content in Pd/Al2O3 was the same before and after catalysis. According to TEM measurements, sintering of metal particles should also be excluded from consideration. Consequently, CO chemisorption can be regarded as the most probable reason for deactivation of Pd component of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. Actually, CO molecules were detected in reaction media during conversion of ethanol on the Pd/Al2O3 sample. These molecules are formed via decarbonylation of ethanal and butanal on metal sites [1–4]. The amount of CO measured after 5 h of the reaction is about 1 × 10−4 mol. This is comparable with the total Pd amount in the catalyst loaded into the reactor (i.e., 5.2 × 10-5 mol). In order to directly verify the inhibitory effect of CO, 1 × 10−4 mol of CO was injected into the reactor containing ethanol and the initial catalyst. Next, the standard test was performed. The results are presented in Table 1. One can see that the A1 activity towards α-alcohol formation decreases from 55.6 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1 (Table 1, Pd/Al2O3, run 1) to 3.5 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1 (Table 1, Pd/Al2O3 with injected CO molecules, run 1). Hence, there is a strong argument to believe that CO molecules deactivate the Pd component of Pd/Al2O3 during ethanol conversion to α-alcohols. The kinetic curves for the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrate a gradual accumulation of butan-1-ol and hexan-1-ol throughout the time range from 0 h to 5 h (Fig. 15 ). The amount of butan-1-ol and hexan-1-ol measured after 5 h of the reaction accounts for 90 % of the products formed. The major by-product is ethoxyethane, but its amount is about 5%. The minor products accumulated in the presence of PdCu/Al2O3 include intermediates of mechanism (II), i.e., ethanal and butanal, ethoxybutane, C5+ compounds, and C1-C4 compounds such as CnH2n+2, CnH2n, and CO (n = 1–4). The amount of minor products measured after 5 h of the reaction accounts for 0.2−0.6% of the products formed. The A1 activity of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst is 59.5 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1, which is comparable with the A1 activity of Pd/Al2O3 catalyst before its deactivation (Table 1, run 1). This result indicates that the active sites in Pd/Al2O3 and the PdCu/Al2O3 are similar, i.e., they are Pd°-Al2O3 interfaces. The A1/A2 ratio for the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst is 27 (Table 1, run 1). Thus, the overall performance of the bimetallic catalyst towards the target process is high. The amount of CO measured after 5 h of the reaction in the presence of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst is about 1.3 × 10−4 mol, which is comparable with that generated in the presence of Pd/Al2O3. However, CO molecules produced via side reactions do not play a significant role in Pd° component deactivation in the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst, as opposed to Pd/Al2O3 (cf kinetic curves for accumulation of α-alcohols shown in Figs. 14 and 15). The independent test with added CO also confirms this conclusion (Table 1, run 1). Thus, the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst combines a high activity towards the target process with a high resistance to CO poisoning. According to kinetic data described above, the catalytic behavior of the PdCu/Al2O3 sample cannot be explained by the presence of small fraction of individual Pd or Cu particles. The same is true for the bare Al2O3 surface, which is also present in the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst. One more component of the PdCu/Al2O3 sample is comprised of alloy particles deposited on alumina surface. Consequently, this component should be responsible for the catalytic behavior of PdCu/Al2O3. According to structural data of the present study and known features of mechanism (II), the reasons for the high performance of alloy particles supported on Al2O3 can be summarized as follows: 1) alloy particles possess Pd0 sites required for high rate of α-alcohol formation via mechanism (II); 2) modification of Pd with Cu in alloy particles decreases the adsorption of CO molecules on Pd0 sites (This means that the surface of palladium component of the catalyst is not blocked by CO molecules generated via side reactions); 3) the Al2O3 sites and Pd0 sites of deposited alloy particles are in close proximity, which ensures tight contact between the redox and acid-base components of the catalyst and promotes the reaction sequence of mechanism (II), starting from dehydrogenation of ethanol to ethanal on Pd0 sites followed by aldol crotonic condensation on Al2O3 sites, and subsequent hydrogenation of reaction intermediate to α−alcohol on Pd0 sites."
10,Long term performance of the catalysts in α-alcohol formation,"3.5 Long term performance of the catalysts in α-alcohol formation In order to elucidate the long term performance of deposited alloy particles in the formation of α-alcohols, the A1 activities of the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst and its monometallic analogues were measured in 20 successive runs. The results are presented in Table 1. The A1 activities of the Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 (Cu = 0.1 wt.%) catalysts measured in run 1 are (0.04−0.05) × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1. The A1 activities of these catalysts measured in run 20 resemble those measured in run 1. No running-out effects were observed [24]. The activities found for the Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 samples are low. This conclusion can be deduced from comparison of A1 values for catalysts surveyed in Ref. [9]. Some representative examples are listed below. The A1 activity of Pt-Re/Al2O3 (Pt = 0.3 wt.%, Re = 0.3 wt.%) measured at 275 ○C is 23 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1. The A1 activity of the Au-Fe/Al2O3 (Au = 0.2 wt.%, Fe = 0.1 wt.%) measured at 275 ○C is 25 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1. The A1 activity of the Ni-Mo/Al2O3 (Ni = 5 wt.%, Mo = 10 wt.%) measured at 280 ○C is 1.2 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1. Thus, the surface sites of the Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts used in the present study possess the sustainable but low performance for conversion of ethanol to α-alcohols at 275 °C. The A1 activity of the Pd/Al2O3 (Pd = 0.1 wt.%) catalyst measured in run 1 is 55.6 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1 (Table 1). This A1 value is rather high, as can be seen from comparative analysis of the A1 values presented in the paragraph above. At about 99.8 % of the initial A1 activity of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is lost after 3 sequential runs (Table 1). The A1 activity of Pd/Al2O3 also decreases throughout runs 3–15, but the decrease is less pronounced. The A1 activity of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst measured in its stable operation mode is 0.04 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1 (Table 1, run 20). This A1 value is comparable with those observed for the Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts possessing low performance for the conversion of ethanol to α-alcohols. According to kinetic data of the present study, the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst accelerates the formation of CO molecules via side reactions. Gradual sorption of CO molecules on the Pd component surface during sequential runs results in a rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Thus, the surface sites of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst used in the present study possess high but unsustainable performance for the conversion of ethanol to α-alcohols at 275 °C. The A1 activity of the PdCu/Al2O3 (Pd = 0.1 wt.%, Cu = 0.1 wt.%) catalyst measured in run 1 is 59.5 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1 (Table 1). The initial A1 activity of the PdCu/Al2O3 sample decreases slightly in run 2. This effect can be attributed to deactivation of metal sites on the surface of individual Pd particles present in the bimetallic catalyst in a small amount. The A1 values of the PdCu/Al2O3 sample measured in runs 2–20 are similar and high (≈ 55.6 × 10−4 mol × h-1 × g-1). This result indicates that the PdCu/Al2O3 sample possesses sustained and high performance for the conversion of ethanol to desired alcohols at 275 °C."
11,Conclusion,"The Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 samples possess low performance for α-alcohols formation. This result can be explained by low activity of these catalysts towards conversion of ethanol to α-alcohols via mechanism (II) at 275 ○C. The Pd/Al2O3 sample possesses high initial performance for α-alcohol formation, because of high activity of Pd°-Al2O3 interfaces in the ethanol conversion to α-alcohols via mechanism (II) at 275 ○C. However, the durability of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is low, because of deactivation of Pd° sites by CO molecules produced in side reactions. Modification of palladium with copper species in the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst results in the formation of alloy particles. This leads to an increased durability of bimetallic samples, because of suppressing of CO sorption on Pd° sites of alloy particles. As a result, for the PdCu/Al2O3 catalyst, the sustained ethanol conversion (41 %) accompanied by 91 % selectivity to α-alcohols is observed in each of 20 sequential runs."
