0,Introduction,"Demand for biodegradable nanocomposites have been increased for applications in packaging, biomedical, textile and paints industry due to its environmental friendly nature, cost effective and ease of processing characteristics. Nano fillers have been used to enhance the performance of these biopolymers to get high mechanical strength, thermally stable, durable product. The integration of nanofiller at molecular level leads to efficient load transfer which makes it useful for high performance applications. Nanocomposites employing carbon based nanofillers have been used to integrate to achieve high electron mobility, high tensile modulus, exceptional antibacterial property, UV blocking ability, electrically conductive etc [1–4]. Recently graphene oxide (GO), a sp2 hybridized two dimensional planar structure has attracted attention owing to its excellent thermal, mechanical, electrical properties [5]. GO has exceptional applications in energy storage devices, anti-static coatings, automotive industry, corrosion resistant devices, super capacitors, solar cells etc [6–10]. As compared to carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide exhibits large aspect ratio, low production cost, high biocompatibility, high breaking strength, high young's modulus etc. Modification in graphene can lead to its use in nanomedicine, bio sensing, anticancer, gene delivery, nano carrier etc. Chaudhary et al. reported the effect of incorporation of fibers on the viscoelastic behavior of epoxy based composites which shows enhancement in mechanical strength [11]. Poly (vinyl alcohol) is a water soluble biopolymer exhibits excellent film forming ability for packaging applications. Due to its hydrophilic nature, it can be easily cross-linked with graphene oxide attributed to its hydroxyl functional groups present at the edges. As being a semi crystalline polymer, its non-toxic nature leads to its use in packaging applications. Due to the excellent physical properties, it can be used in oxygen barrier, pharmaceutical and packaging purposes [12]. PVA polymer due to its biocompatibility and emulsifying properties, it can be utilized in paints, coatings, adhesives and edible packaging material [13,14]. The interaction of nanoparticles in PVA matrix is facilitated by strong Van der Waals forces of attraction and existence of hydroxyl groups present at the edges which helps in uniform dispersion due to large surface area of GO. The lower mechanical strength and wear resistance properties are the major drawbacks of this polymer which limit its end use applications; which can be overcome by incorporating GO nanofiller. Chemical reduction of GO has been carried out to enhance its mechanical and electrical performance. Here hydrazine hydrate is used as a reducing agent which creates amine moieties in PVA matrix and thus makes nanocomposite films strong and ductile. Rheology is the key parameter to essay change in viscoelastic properties, curing behavior and change in viscosity along with processing conditions. Our main emphasis is on rheological measurements which have been performed to study the detailed molecular structure during processing and the changes in viscoelastic behavior taking place when mechanical shear is applied. Hence physical and chemical properties of a material can be studied as a function of temperature, time or external forces. Our major goal is to focus on effect of GO nanoparticles on relaxation process, curing kinetics and long term ability test of PVA matrix. Despite the extensive literature on PVA-GO nanocomposites and its derivatives, very few researchers have reported the shear rheology and curing behavior of bionanocomposites and influence of nanofiller into matrix. Shear Rheology involves oscillatory shear flow and steady shear flow. Here, oscillatory shear flow is employed which uses small sinusoidal deformation and the response in terms of storage (G’) and loss modulus (G”) is measured as a function of time and temperature [15]."

6,Results and discussions,
7,Morphological characterization,"3.1 Morphological characterization HR-TEM micrograph exhibits smooth and homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles. It is evident from TEM morphology that RGO powder is uniformly dispersed into the PVA matrix demonstrated in Fig. 1 . The resilient interface has been observed on addition of RGO which is also supported by SEM results. This phenomenon validates the firm interaction of functional groups and crosslinking between RGO and PVA matrix which affects the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite [17,18]. It is evident that the RGO sheets have layered structure. The particle size of RGO evaluated from TEM analysis is 50–75 nm evaluated by Image J software. The parallel and fibril alignment can be found when PVA nanocomposites are under mechanical load which influence mechanical properties attributes to the tension provided. RGO nanosheets are oriented parallel onto the biofilm surface. Fig. 1(b) displayed negligible aggregation of nanofiller which is also supported by optical micrographs result that higher content of RGO results in isolated agglomeration of nanoparticles. The TEM analysis revealed semi-transparent surface of PVA with some ripples of RGO which is the result of stresses induced by ultra-sonication treatment. In addition, this effect is attributes to the intrinsic nature of GO sheets. The distribution of GO nanoparticles are very consistent near the edges of the nanocomposite thin film attributes to the effect of surface tension during evaporation of solvent. In Fig. 1 (b), distributions of nanoparticles are not uniform due to the increased content of RGO. The images obtained from optical micrographs shown in Fig. 2 unveil the uniform distribution of RGO in PVA matrix which concludes excellent exfoliation of RGO has taken place. The dispersion of nanofiller creates intercalated network which is also influenced by ultra-sonication process. A slight agglomeration is spotted in Fig. 2(c) and formation of spherulite in Fig. 2(d). In accordance with the SEM results, it is remarkably noted that interactions due to strong hydrogen bonding and efficient load transfer property of RGO results in better dispersion and enhancement in mechanical characteristics. To investigate the fractured surface morphology of nanocomposite films, SEM analysis has been conducted. The transition of dispersed RGO sheets in PVA matrix at relatively high concentration forms clusters which is similar to the transition in liquid crystals from isotropic to nematic [19]. Fractured specimen of nanofiller incorporated PVA revealed existence of wrinkled and grooves in contrary to pristine PVA shown in Fig. 3 . Roughness has been increased on addition of RGO content but pristine PVA has flat and smooth surface. Moreover, stiffness of nanocomposites also increased on addition of nanofiller which is in accordance with rheological test. This property reveals increment in strength when RGO is employed. Well dispersed RGO nanoparticles illustrates excellent interfacial adhesion between nanofiller and PVA matrix. It is interesting to note that crumpled morphology and stacked sheets has been obtained. In Fig. 3(d), the white dappled structure is due the crack formation after performing tensile strength test into smaller pieces owing to aging or rubbing. Ductile fibrils have been found on the surface of RGO reinforced composites in contrary to pristine PVA caused by the tensile stresses."
8,Structural analysis,3.2 Structural analysis Raman spectra in Fig. 4 indicates well defined bands at a frequency of 1600 cm−1(G band) and 1360 cm−1 (D band) which corresponds to the streching vibrations present in the RGO structure. The broaden peak of D band in the case of RGO is due to sp3 bonded carbons which may be assigned to dislocation defects arises in RGO sheets. The layered structure of RGO sheets proved the complete reduction of GO. The intensity ratio of D/G band shows formation of RGO nanoparticles. Neat PVA recorded frequency at 1362 cm−1(D band) and 1610 cm−1(G band).
9,Rheological study,"3.3 Rheological study The shear thinning behavior of polymer nanocomposite is attributed to the strong alignment of nanoparticles in the inner phase of the matrix which occurs generally at low shear rates. Polymeric chains are entangled with each other, as shear is applied; the entangled chains change their shape which results in disentanglement of the molecules and low flow resistance of individual molecules. The particles in liquid suspension are at rest and randomly oriented due to lack of interaction forces, when shear is applied they start to align themselves parallel to the flow direction. This is the reason behind shear thinning behavior of the nanocomposites with decreasing viscosity at high shear rates plotted in Fig. 5 . By increasing the concentration of nanofiller, interactions between PVA and RGO induces strong elastic responses in liquid suspension of RGO doped PVA [20] (Fig. 6). At rest they are displaying plateau of zero shear viscosity, from 0 to 55 s−1, shear thinning behavior is perceived. Neat PVA has 290 mPa viscosity at zero shear rate but on increasing shear rate, decrement in viscosity is observed up to ∼200 mPa and then it becomes consistent. The steeper decline in viscosity from 0 to 2.5 s−1 shear rate evaluated for all nanocomposite thin films is due to narrow molar mass distribution which also depends on structure and size of the nanoparticles. Conventionally, non-monotonic changes have been observed on addition of RGO content in rheological behavior. It can be assumed that at low concentration of RGO, it acts as plasticizer in PVA matrix but on increasing the content RGO accords elastic responses. This may be attributed to the formation of spherulites which can be also seen in optical micrographs in Fig. 2. The high viscosity is a result of stretching of chain molecules of matrix, thereby increasing the intermolecular interactions due to incorporation of nanofiller which reduces the flexibility and suppresses the flow by increasing elastic character. 1% RGO-PVA thin film has 1050 P viscosity due to the higher loading of RGO content but decreasing on increased shear rate. Similar trends have been followed by other nanocomposite thin films which can be seen in Fig. 5. Such type of response is the result of high aspect ratio of RGO sheets which affects the concentration of polymeric solution. The power law (Ostwald de waele equation) regression model helps us to identify the shear thinning behavior of the polymeric material. This can be elucidated by equation (1) in which coefficient p is less than 1 which results in shear thinning behavior of PVA nanocomposites where Y refers to shear rate and x refers to shear rate consistency. (1) Y= a. xP Noticeably, shear thinning behavior of polymers are distinguished by value of p i.e. power law index smaller than unity. Mostly polymer solutions and melts exhibits value of p in range 0.3–0.7 which is influenced by molecular weight and concentration of polymer matrix. The value of p lesser than 0.3 is substantially assigned for fine particle suspensions of polymer nanocomposites. Viscoelastic creep test is referred to retardation i.e. increase in deformation is subject to constant stress with time. It measures the stability of the polymer nanocomposite, when ordinary stress is applied. At initial stage creep rate is constant with time shown in Fig. 7 . Steady state is observed from 10 to 120 s which is also termed as secondary creep. After 120 s fracture or deformation is examined and strain becomes constant. 0.5% RGO-PVA has shown highest elongation and higher strain value. Tertiary creep where deformation accelerates is manifestation of non-linear viscoelasticity and also occurs for ductile materials at high stress. Creep compliance test elaborates the rate at which strain is increased with time under constant load. It can be seen that creep test is invariant with applied load for a viscoelastic material. Creep compliance changes as a function of stress and does not comply with the presumption of linear viscoelastic behavior of polymers explained in Fig. 8 . The material in most cases does not return to its original position and permanent deformation occurs which mainly depends on strain rate, time, temperature and polymer matrix etc. Fig. 9 shows the curing phenomena taking place in neat PVA and 1% RGO-PVA nanocomposites. It is interesting to study the thermal transition taking place in polymer matrix when sample is kept from low to high temperature. The cross-over point indicates the structural regeneration or crystallization point. The crystallization process takes place at −10 °C and completed by 5 °C temperature. The cured stage is also called gelation or softening point. Cross over point indicates the sol-gel transition takes place where storage modulus (solid like behavior) is dominating over loss modulus (liquid like behavior) and hence G’ becomes equal to G”. PVA being a semi-crystalline polymer could affect by the RGO i.e. non-crystallizing component as a result it modifies the structure which slightly alters the curing process [21,22]. DMTA gives information about elastic modulus during elastic deformation under temperature sweep i.e. storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) which indicates energy lost or viscous portion of the nanocomposite shown in Fig. 10 . The damping factor i.e. loss tangent (tan δ) is calculated as the ratio of G’/G’’. It depicts 1% RGO-PVA has highest storage modulus i.e. 6.7958 E +09 Pa in contrary to pristine PVA i.e. 6.0231 E+08 Pa. The depreciation clearly shows the repulsion effect which occurs due to the presence of particles into the close proximity. Here, the effect is seen precisely due to the existence of polar carboxylic and hydroxylic groups which are intercalated. This fact restricts the rotation & dispersion forces of polymeric chain and makes it stable. Storage modulus of any polymer also depends on its molecular weight which can vary on different types of grade of the matrix. It represents ideal elastic behavior in which tan δ = 0, means there is no viscous region. The maxima of loss modulus describe the glass transition temperature which can be seen in Fig. 11 . G′ is depreciating gradually on increasing temperature due to increased segmental mobility of polymeric chain until the glass transition region is reached, afterwards decrement in G′ is observed. In semi-crystalline polymers, when it is in cold state G’ > G”, where molecules are arranged orderly but in molten state, molecules are free to move. The characteristic feature of Tg of partially crystalline material is also named as rubber-elastic plateau. Here, some amorphous portion is in molten state but crystalline region is not. Therefore, the neat PVA is neither unambiguously liquid nor solid [23,24]. The nanocomposite films are very stiff at 30 °C which displays elastic behavior dominates. The Tg of neat PVA is around 30 °C above which it becomes soft or flexible but as we increasing nanofiller content slight shift in Tg is observed due to the omnipresence of amine functionalities in RGO which makes strong Van der Waals forces of attraction when comes in contact with pristine PVA. The Tg of nanofiller induced polymer composite films has been shifted to 35 °C owing to the transition taking place due to the existence of amine functionality. Therefore as RGO content is increased, a slight increment in Tg is observed. Frequency sweep is used to evaluate long term stability of nanocomposite films where G′ is higher than G″ which can be easily contemplated from Fig. 12 . Neat PVA has lowest G′ and G” in comparision to other functionalized thin films which can be ascribed to the enhanced stiffness due to the incorporation of RGO. In addition, interaction of functional groups and increased entanglements of polymer chain results in enhanced storage modulus [25]. 1% RGO incorporated PVA nanofilm has highest G′ and G″ which can be distinguished due to the high mechanical strength of RGO nanofiller. Here, PVA matrix acts as a crosslinking agents into RGO nanosheets and creates 3D network which facilitates strong hydrogen bonding interaction within the polymer [26]. Thus on increasing the RGO content, interaction is also enhanced results in rigid and ductile product. The compatibility and interaction of functional moities intensify the dispersion of RGO in PVA matrix on molecular level as well as interfacial adhesion between the RGO and PVA which appreciably changes the phase transition and elevate the mechanical properties by transforming microstructures [27]. Incorporation of RGO content enhances the resiliency of the developed nanocomposites at lower frequencies. 1% RGO reinforced PVA is highly resilient as compared to neat PVA. Here, long term stability is directly related to the behaviour of nanocomposites at lower frequencies. The amplitude test generally describes the upper limit range of deformation behavior as a function of frequency explained in Fig. 13 . The linear viscoelastic range phenomena indicates the range in which testing can be done without damaging the structure. The linear viscoelastic region of RGO filled polymer nanocomposite is generally higher than the unfilled polymer matrix. G′ has 6.5 E+3 MPa and G″ has 1.2 E+3 MPa of neat PVA. 0.5% RGO has highest G′ and G″ MPa values, this behavior is attributed to the better dispersion of RGO nanoparticles throughout the PVA matrix [28]. The plateau values of linear viscoelastic region is obtained at 0.01 strain rate are 6.34 E+3 to 4.05 E+4 MPa for neat PVA and 1% RGO-PVA respectively attributes to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions."
10,Conclusion,"PVA nanocomposites unveiled pseudo plastic behavior of nanocomposites. Optical micrographs confirmed the homogeneous dispersion of RGO nanoparticles into PVA matrix which is the consequence of outstanding interaction of hydrogen bonding and functional groups. As RGO content is increased, curing temperature has been also increased due to the hindered segmental mobility of polymeric chains. The high aspect ratio of RGO leads to stress transfer which enhances mechanical strength. It is evident that nitrogen containing moieties creates negative charge on the RGO surface which can interact effectively with the PVA chains via hydrogen bonding. The frequency test revealed that 1% RGO incorporated PVA is more stable compared to pristine PVA. RGO dispersion acquits oneself as thixotropic fluid which significantly enhances storage and loss modulus of polymeric nanocomposites compared to virgin polymer. Exceptional properties of graphene and its derivatives envisioned research fraternity towards moderation in the field of packaging, biomedical devices, biosensors, tissue engineering, electrochemical devices, paint, coatings and adhesives etc. Therefore, rheological studies of these polymeric nano-materials are of prime importance which relates to processing conditions, materials design to create novel materials."
