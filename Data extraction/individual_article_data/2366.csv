0,Introduction,"In a carbon constraint economy, limited by dwindling fossil fuel reserves and climate change, renewable energy derived from biomass, solar, hydraulic and wind power will become increasingly important in the production of hydrogen for fuel cells utilisation. The potential for renewable energy sources is huge around the world, and in particular in Brazil, where ethanol from sugarcane is produced at extremely competitive prices. In addition to a large solar and wind energy potential, Brazil has in place an extensive hydropower electrical grid, thus favouring energy production where non-renewable carbon emissions can be no longer acceptable by our society. The most efficient and environmental benign route to transforming electricity into transportable energy must necessarily stem from hydrogen production and fuel cell technology. Renewable energy processed and stored as hydrogen in regions with large energy resources could be transported to where demand is required such as large regional centres. Countries with a large renewable energy potential such as Brazil can play an important role in developing and using technologies for hydrogen production and fuel cell applications. Notwithstanding the technical issues, a big picture approach must be considered, addressing the triple bottom line (economical, environmental and social) and politics among many other issues. The wide range of fuel sources, conversion technologies and fuel processing, shown in Fig. 1 , illustrate the flexibility of hydrogen and fuel cell systems. Hydrogen has been shown as an alternative for an energetic vector to replace conventional non-renewable resources based on fossil fuels. The use of hydrogen as an energy carrier may be a form of integrating the diverse possibilities of energy sources and utilisation in the near future. There are several options for hydrogen production and utilisation as outlined in Fig. 1, out of which four main technological ‘green’ paths are highlighted. Hydrogen production via electrolysis (path I) is a feasible route, especially using hydro, solar or wind power where these sources are abundant. As of 2007, the country's installed power capacity was about 100GW, from which about 78% is based on hydroelectricity [1]. Cheap off-peak energy production could be used for a large-scale production of hydrogen from electrolysis in Brazil at half the cost of production as compared to fossil fuels [1]. Other technological options being extensively investigated in Brazil include obtaining hydrogen from biological resources, mainly from biodiesel (path II) and bioethanol (path III) or using ethanol directly as fuel for fuel cells (path IV). Steam reforming of biofuels may be performed externally or internally, which is most economically attractive, in the case of high temperature fuel cells [2]. Biodiesel is currently the major strategic focus to the transportation sector in Brazil in terms of research and policy development. Biodiesel can be produced industrially from various vegetable oils and animal fats and there are three plants producing 57 million litres/year [3]. Brazil is the largest ethanol producer and exporter in the world. Its daily 2006 production exceeds 300,000 barrels [3]. Brazil has also a long tradition with alternative fuels, stemming from high oil prices and consumption in the 1970s and coupled with limited internal supply of oil. Brazil is the only country in the world that already has extensive alternative renewable fuel infrastructure. Brazilian production and commercialization of flex-fuel (gasoline-ethanol) vehicles reached the amount of two million units in August 2007 [4]. Launched only 3 years ago, the flex-fuel vehicles represent 77% of automobiles and light trucks sales in the country [4]. Fuel cells powered by hydrogen from renewable sources are environmental friendly compared to conventional combustion engines powered by fossil fuels. Depending on the efficiencies of fuel cell and internal combustion engine vehicles, replacing gasoline with renewable hydrogen produced from solar energy or wind power leads to reductions of greenhouse gas emissions of up to 8 and 23 times, respectively, and air pollution emission reductions of up to 32 and 76 times, respectively [5]. The economics of hydrogen production depend on a variety of internal and external factors. While the cost of hydrogen derived from fossil fuels ranges between US$ 5–13 per GJ, conventional natural gas steam reform is the most economically efficient process delivering hydrogen at US$ 5 per GJ [6]. Hydrogen produced from biomass, wind or solar power is currently two to three times more costly than hydrogen obtained from natural gas [7], thus requiring further research and process efficiency optimisation to compete against traditional hydrogen production processes. Hence, we envisage that it will take a while for a hydrogen economy based on renewable sources to become economically competitive. In view of the renewable energy potential, Brazil, among other countries, may play a key role in technological research, development and deployment towards a feasible hydrogen economy. In this work, we reviewed key issues concerning energy sources, hydrogen production and fuel cells in Brazil. First, a brief presentation of geographic and economic data comparing Brazil and selected countries is given. Then, a section on energy supply and demand within the country is presented with special consideration given to renewable sources of energy. A section on hydrogen production from biofuels and hydro, solar and wind power follows. Finally, major efforts on research and development of fuel cells in Brazil are reported."
1,Geography and economy,"Brazil is the fifth largest country by geographical area and the fifth most populous country (Table 1 ) [8]. Its territory passes through the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn and is home to varied fauna and flora, as well as extensive natural resources. The Brazilian population tends to concentrate along the coastline in large urban centres, which also houses the country's industrial activities. While the country has one of the largest populations in the world, population density is low and the inner continental land has large areas of low population. Brazil's GDP is the highest of Latin America with large and developed agricultural, mining, manufacturing, and service sectors [8]. The country has been expanding its presence in international financial and commodities markets, and is regarded as one of the “group of four” emerging economies, BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China). Major Brazilian exports include iron ore, steel, coffee, soybean, orange juice, corned beef, textiles, footwear, ethanol, electrical equipment, automobiles, and aircraft. According to the International Monetary Fund [9] and the World Bank [10], Brazil has the ninth largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity and tenth largest at market exchange rates. Brazil has a diversified middle income economy with wide variations in development levels."
2,Energy production and consumption,"Brazil is the tenth largest energy consumer in the world and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere [11]. It is also an important oil and gas producer in the region and the world's largest ethanol producer and exporter [12]. Energy production in Brazil increased rapidly over the past 35 years as depicted in Fig. 2 [13]. Between 1970 and 2005, the total energy use increased from 66.9×106 to 218.7×106 tpe (tonnes of petroleum equivalent) – equivalent to 227% increase – while energy use per capita increased to 68%. The Brazilian energy sector supplied nearly 90% of the national demand in 2005. The remaining 10% were imported fuels including coal and natural gas [13]. Rapid industrialization, including high growth of some energy-intensive industries such as aluminium and steel production, and increasing residential and commercial energy services were the main causes of the growing energy use [14]. Fig. 2 also shows the evolution of different energy sources over the past 35 years [13]. The following discussion takes the year 2005 as a basis. Brazil greatly expanded its park of hydroelectric plants, with total hydro generated power increasing from 3.4×106 in 1970 to 32.4×106 tpe, equivalent to approximately 15% of all energy demand. Petroleum is the largest primary source of energy, accounting for 39% of total energy requirements. Fuel substitution and conservation efforts, including the national ethanol fuel program, limited growth in consumption of petroleum products over the past decades. Coal and natural gas are minor sources of energy in Brazil, although the consumption of natural gas recently experienced fast growth. Bioenergy sources, including wood, charcoal, and sugarcane products (ethanol and bagasse) provided about 27% of total energy consumed. The consumption of fuel wood and charcoal declined by one-third over the past 35 years, but was compensated by the growth in sugarcane products. With its high dependence on hydroelectricity and bioenergy, renewable energy sources accounted for nearly 45% of total energy supply. This value corresponds to a very high fraction compared to the world's renewable energy average (13%) [13]. Table 2 shows the consumption of energy by sector in 1970 and 2005. The industrial sector is the largest energy consumer and its share increased from 28.4 to 40.2% over the past 35 years [13]. The energy and transportation sectors also increased their shares, while the residential and agriculture shares declined. The steep reduction in the residential share is due to the displacement of fuel wood by bottled gas for cooking and electricity for household appliances. The energy policy in Brazil in the last decades attempted to reduce the country's dependence on foreign energy supplies and stimulate the development of domestic energy resources. Policies were devised to increase domestic oil production, expand ethanol fuel production, generate nuclear energy, and conserve energy [1]. The effort to increase ethanol production and use has been very successful with production reaching around 308,000 barrels per day in 2006. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) [11] forecasted that Brazil's ethanol production will reach 329,000 and 365,000bbl/d for 2007 and 2008, respectively. Efforts to expand domestic oil output, including developing new techniques for oil production in deep waters, were also very successful. Domestic oil production increased from about 0.2 million bbl/d in 1980 to nearly 2.2 million bbl/d in 2006 [11]. These policies and their outcomes benefited the country's balance of trade, national security, capital goods industry, and labour market. During the 1990s, the energy policy focused on privatizing and restructuring both the petroleum and the power sectors. Also, an effort was made to stimulate the development and utilisation of natural gas in Brazil. These initiatives have had mixed success. Flaws in this strategy led to relatively little investment in new generation and transmission facilities during the late 1990s, which in turn contributed to severe power shortages in 2001 [14]. The supply of natural gas is increasing, but demand has not matched supply, mainly due to the high cost of gas imports. The government agencies responsible for energy policy are the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) [1], the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) [15] and the National Agency of Electrical Energy (ANEEL) [16]. Current government policies focus mainly on the improvement of energy efficiency, in both residential and industrial sectors, as well as increasing renewable energy. Further restructuring of the energy sector will be one of the key issues for ensuring sufficient energy investments to meet the rising need for fuel and electricity [1]."
3,Non-renewable energy,"3.1 Non-renewable energy Brazil is the world's 15th largest oil producer [3]. Until 1997, the oil monopoly belonged to the Brazilian Petroleum Company, Petrobras [17]. Since changes to the petroleum market, more than 50 oil companies have been engaged in oil exploration [18]. Petrobras remains the only global oil producer, delivering more than 2 million bbl/d [3]. Petrobras is also a major distributor of oil products, and owns oil refineries and oil tankers [11]. Furthermore, Brazil has 11.7 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the second largest in South America after Venezuela [3]. The vast majority of proven reserves are located at Campos and Santos offshore basins on the south-east coast of Brazil [11]. Transpetro, a wholly owned subsidiary of Petrobras, operates a crude oil transport network. The system consists of about 6500km of crude oil pipelines, coastal import terminals, and inland storage facilities [11]. Brazil's natural gas reserves are estimated at 331 billionm3 [3]. The Campos and Santos offshore basins in the south-east region hold the largest Brazilian natural gas fields. Other natural gas basins are located in north and north-east regions. Recent discoveries offshore in the Santos Basin will likely increase Brazil's natural gas reserves considerably in coming years [19]. Petrobras controls over 90% of Brazil's natural gas reserves. The inland gas pipeline systems are operated by Transpetro. In 2006, the gas production was 48.5 millionm3/day, which is less than the natural gas consumption of Brazil [3]. Gas imports come mainly from Bolivia's Rio Grande basin through the Bolivia–Brazil gas pipeline, or from Argentina through the Paraná–Uruguayana pipeline, and from LNG imports. Brazil has held talks with Venezuela and Argentina to build a new pipeline system, Gran Gasoducto del Sur, linking the three countries. However, the plan has yet to go beyond the planning stages [11]. Brazil has total coal reserves of about 30 billion tonnes, but the deposits vary in quality and quantity [20]. The proved recoverable reserves are around 11 billion tonnes. In 2005 Brazil produced 5.8 million tonnes of coal [21], while coal consumption reached 21.6 million tonnes [22]. Almost all of Brazil's coal output is steam coal, of which about 85% is fired in coal power stations. Reserves of sub-bituminous coal are located mostly in the southern states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná [22]. Currently nine coal-powered plants totalling 1415MW are located in Southern Brazil. In 2006, they were responsible for the production of 7.4TWh, equivalent to only 1.6% of the internal electrical energy supply [1]. Brazil has the sixth largest uranium reserves in the world with ∼309.000tonnes of U3O8 mainly in the states of Bahia, Ceará, Paraná and Minas Gerais [23]. In 2005 U3O8 production reached 129tonnes [21]. Nuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity, equivalent to 13 billionkWh per year [24]. The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear, which has two nuclear reactors in Angra dos Reis (Rio de Janeiro). Angra I (657MW) and Angra II (1348MW) were connected to the electrical grid in 1982 and 2000, respectively [25]. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of 1350MW, is planned for completion by 2010, while there are plans for building a further seven nuclear power stations [26]."
4,Renewable energy,"3.2 Renewable energy 3.2.1 Biofuels A wide variety of fuels can be produced from renewable raw materials of biological origin [27]. An overview of typical conversion routes and fuel products is given in Fig. 3 . There has been considerable interest in producing fuels from vegetal and animal origin since the oil crisis in the 1970s. It has been reinforced by subsequent environmental concerns and recent political events in the Middle East. Thermo-chemical conversion of wood, straw and lignocellulosic residues as fuel in gasification and liquefaction through pyrolysis and liquefaction in pressurized solvents. Biochemical conversion is based on a different set of feedstocks that includes wood raw materials as well as corn and sugarcane. Both acid and enzyme hydrolysis are thought as options, followed by fermentation. The liquid products generated include biodiesel and alcohol fuels (methanol and ethanol), which in some cases require minor refining to become marketable products. In terms of absolute fuel costs, thermo-chemical conversion delivers the lowest cost products at the least complex process. Biochemical routes are the least attractive. The most attractive processes from comparing production costs to product values are generally the alcohol fuels, which enjoy a higher market value [27]. In Brazil, researches in fuels from biomass are currently being carried out in many research institutes and universities. A good database for general statistics and cooperative work on this field can be found on the website of the Brazilian Reference Centre on Biomass (CENBIO) [28]. 3.2.1.1 Bioethanol Due to its ethanol fuel production, Brazil has sometimes been described as a bioenergy superpower [29]. Bioethanol or simply ethanol is produced from sugarcane, which prospers in the country's tropical climate. Brazil has the largest sugarcane crop, and is the largest producer and exporter of ethanol in the world. Coimex Trading is the largest producer of ethanol in the country [12]. With the advent of the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian government initiated in 1975 the National Alcohol Program (Proalcool) [30]. This was a nation-wide program financed by the government to phase out all automobile fuels derived from fossil fuels in favour of ethanol. The program successfully reduced the number of cars running on gasoline in Brazil by 10 million, thereby reducing the country's dependence on oil imports [1]. In 1984, 94.5% of Brazil's cars used ethanol as fuel [31]. Currently over half of all cars in the country are fitted with the flex-fuel technology, meaning that they can run on 100 percent ethanol or any ethanol–gasoline mixture. Eighty percent of new cars sold in Brazil are flex-fuel vehicles [4]. All gasoline in the country contains ethanol, with blending levels varying from 20 to 25% [3]. The combustion of ethanol causes much less local pollution than gasoline. Ethanol does not emit SO x or other pollutants, such as CO. This has contributed to a decrease in the pollution index of SO x in many Brazilian large cities [32]. Since ethanol is a renewable resource from biomass, the net production of CO2 is almost zero, except in the case where processing, transportation and agricultural fertilizers production use fossil fuels. Hence, ethanol can be considered as carbon neutral and does not contribute in aggravating the greenhouse effect [30]. One of the major reasons of the success of the Brazilian Ethanol program is related to major agricultural improvements. The productivity of sugarcane has increased from 49 to 77tonnes per hectare from 1976 to 2007 [33,34]. Producers are investing in new agricultural techniques and mechanization. In addition, genetic improvements in sugarcane using biotechnology occurred in the last 30 years, directly related to research undertaken in many universities and institutes. Also, government and sugarcane producers have made considerable efforts to diminish the environmental impacts of the sugarcane activities, such as using less environmentally damaging harvest methods and controlling the release of by-products [35]. At the onset of the Proalcool program, many by-products of ethanol production from sugarcane, such as bagasse and dunder were dumped or burned [30]. However, bagasse has become a useful burning fuel for furnaces and co-generation while dunder has found application as a liquid fertilizer, thus showing good commercial values [35]. In 2003, one of the biggest Brazilian ethanol industries started consuming 50% of the residual sugarcane bagasse to produce 60MW electrical energy. Further studies aimed at the increase in the biosynthesis of sucrose and ethanol productivity are being conducted to understand the genetics of sugarcane [31]. The technology of the combustion engines for ethanol has been continuously developed and improved. Research began in 1970s at the Centre for Aerospace Technology (CTA) [36] in São Paulo and is now carried out in many Brazilian universities, technology research centres and automobile companies. This research has helped to increase the engine efficiency. Also, other parts of the car have constantly been innovated to improve car durability and reduce maintenance costs, such as the improvement of start-up and alcohol filtering. A build-up in the capacity of the mechanics to work with ethanol-powered cars could be mentioned as another technical improvement that has occurred along the time [30]. The direct use of ethanol in the so-called direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) overcomes both the storage and infrastructure challenge of hydrogen for fuel cell applications. DEFC uses ethanol in the fuel cell instead of the more toxic methanol used in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). Ethanol is an interesting alternative to methanol because it has a higher energy density (8.0kWh/kg) compared to methanol (6.1kWh/kg). Moreover, bio-generated ethanol is attractive since growing crops for biofuels soaks up a fair amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere [37]. 3.2.1.2 Biodiesel Historically, during petroleum shortages, vegetable oils and their derivatives were proposed as alternatives to petroleum diesel fuel in Brazil [38]. Different approaches have been proposed, including the use of vegetable oils (pure or in blends) or their derivatives, such as hydrocarbons obtained by thermal-catalytic cracking and fatty acids' methyl or ethyl esters (nowadays known as biodiesel) produced by alcoholysis [39]. Studies are under way for producing biodiesel in Brazil using plant sources, such as soybean, palm, sunflower, cottonseed, and castor oil [40]; and even from the vegetable oil waste in cities, such as from food processing and restaurant cooking oil [41,42]. A promising alternative is to make use of agricultural and forestry waste [39]. The estimated production costs for biodiesel obtained from different raw materials is dependent on each Brazilian region or climate, as seen in Fig. 4 [40]. The National Program of Production and Use of Biodiesel (PNPB) was launched in December 2004 [43]. Its main objective is to guarantee the economically viable production of biodiesel, and its major goal being social inclusion and regional development [38]. The most important action from PNPB was the introduction of biofuels derived from oils and fats in the Brazilian energy matrix by the optional use of blends up to 2% of biodiesel (B2) by 2008 and 5% by 2013 (B5). After 2013 the use of B5 will be mandatory [39]. 3.2.2 Hydroelectric power In historical terms, power generation in Brazil has been characterized by an approach that is peculiar within the international context of dependence on fossil fuels. This privileged situation has been building up since the middle of the 20th century, based on Brazil's massive hydroelectric power potential. Brazil is the third largest hydroelectricity producer in the world after China and Canada [20]. As seen in Table 3 , there is a worldwide marked predominance of fossil fuel-powered plants (66.1% including coal, natural gas and oil), followed by hydro (16.1%) and nuclear (15.7%) powered plants [13]. In Brazil, hydropower corresponds to 85.1% of the total power production [13]. The gross theoretical capability exceeds 3000TWh/year, of which 800TWh/year is economically exploitable [22]. In 2005, Brazil produced 325TWh of hydropower [13]. Currently, the installed hydroelectric capacity at plants is 71GW, including both large (>30MW) and small (≤30MW) plants [13]. Brazil co-owns the Itaipu hydroelectric power plant on the Paraná River located on the border between Brazil and Paraguay, which is one of the world's largest operational hydroelectric power plants with an installed generation capacity of 14GW by 20 generating units of 700MW each [44]. Due the Brazil's reliance on hydroelectric power, the drought in 2000–2001 resulted in recurring blackouts, and in June 2001 the government was forced to ration electricity usage, which ended in late 2001. However, the country still remains vulnerable to power outages [45]. 3.2.3 Solar energy The total installed photovoltaic power capacity in Brazil is estimated to be between 12 and 15MW, of which 50% is for telecommunications systems and 50% for rural energy systems [25]. Brazilian insolation potential was measured by the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) [46] during 10 years, based on observations of 187 meteorological stations. Table 4 shows an expressive variation in the insolation potential between winter (July) and summer (January) [47]. The study concluded that solar insolation potential is higher in north-east Brazil and reaches an average potential of 206W/m2. Brazil has a high potential for photovoltaic solar energy generation. The Brazilian north-east has an average solar radiation of 1800kWh/m2 year [48], reaching up to 1950kWh/m2 [49]. Higher levels of solar radiation are only observed in desert regions in North and South America, North and South Africa, Middle East, China and Australia (Fig. 5 ) [49]. Currently in Brazil, institutes and research centres have been dedicated to the study, development and application of solar technology. Among this group of institutions, it is worth noting the Wind and Solar Energy Reference Centre (CRESESB) [50] connected to the Electric Energy Research Centre (CEPEL) [51] and the Brazilian Centre for the Development of the Photovoltaic Solar Energy (CB-Solar) [52]. 3.2.4 Wind energy Brazil's gross wind resource potential is estimated to be about 140GW, of which 30GW could be effectively transformed into wind power projects. The current installed capacity is 22MW generating about 54GWh/year [22]. A preliminary wind map of Brazil using computer simulations and based on atmospheric models is shown in Fig. 6 [53]. It can be observed that the best wind speeds are in the coastal areas, especially in the north-east region, including the states of Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco and Bahia with some plants already in operation [53]. The analysis of the wind data of several places in the north-east region of Brazil has confirmed the calling for wind trading in the area: high average wind speeds (>8.5m/s) and low turbulence level year round compared with the winds registered in Europe and United States, and an indication of steady wind direction [53]. The wind technology in Brazil is being investigated in many institutes, such as the Wind and Solar Energy Reference Centre (CRESESB) [50] and the Brazilian Wind Energy Centre (CBEE) [54]."
5,"Electricity generation, transmission and distribution","3.3 Electricity generation, transmission and distribution The power sector reforms were launched in the mid-1990s and a new regulatory framework was applied in 2004 [1]. After the slow and incomplete implementation of privatization, the electricity sector was reformed into a structure comprised by three entities: the National Electrical Energy Agency (ANEEL) [16], the National Operator System (ONS) [55] and the Wholesale Market of Energy (MAE). ANEEL is in charge of carrying out the regulation and control of the sector. ONS coordinates, plans, and operates the electric interconnected system and MAE runs the energy wholesale market. The major power company is Eletrobrás, which together with its subsidiaries generates and transmits approximately 60% of Brazil's electric supply. The largest private-owned power company is Tractebel Energia [11]. Private ownership is now dominant in the power distribution sector. In contrast, the generation segment is still largely owned by the public sector. Although the power distribution system is classified as hydrothermal in Brazil, there is a strong dominance of hydroelectric plants distributed in 12 different hydrographical basins located in different areas of the country. Except for the nuclear plants, these are supplemented by coal power, solar and wind plants with several public and private owners. The country's installed power capacity was 100,516MW, distributed among different generation types as displayed in Table 5 , which shows about 78% of the capacity based on hydroelectricity [13]. Fig. 7 shows the electro-energy integration can be seen between the production system and the load centres interconnected by the transmission system. Through the transmission line system, which works as communication links, it has been possible to accomplish the transfer of energy among regions for the recovery of storage levels in reservoirs."
6,Hydrogen production from natural resources,"Electrochemical extraction of energy from hydrogen via fuel cells is an especially clean and efficient method of meeting power demands, and introduces the need for establishing the infrastructure for a hydrogen economy. Hydrogen is typically thought of as an energy carrier, and not generally as an energy source. Hydrogen is usually produced from other energy sources such as fossil or biomass fuels, or from water electrolysis using thermal, hydro, solar or wind power (Fig. 1). The choice of source for a future hydrogen economy in Brazil, due to the specific local factors, will probably rely on renewable resources, mainly on hydropower and biofuels, which are also environmentally friendly and plentifully available in the country. The processes used to produce hydrogen will depend on technology development, required infrastructure investment, efficiency, location and suitability of local supplies [56]. Environmental and socio-economic impact studies of a long-term hydrogen economy in Brazil showed that the introduction of solar hydrogen would increase the energy consumption, gross national product per capita, and the quality of life, while reducing pollution [57]. A faster introduction of hydrogen would hasten the benefits, providing Brazil with a clean, permanent and sustainable energy system. Given Brazil's high reliance on renewable energy sources, mainly biomass fuels [2,58,59] and hydroelectric power [60], the government foresees such feedstock as the basis for hydrogen energy production [1]. Use of wind power and photovoltaic cells for hydrogen production has also been reported as a possible alternative [5]. A comparative study of fuels for on-board hydrogen production for fuel cell-powered automobiles found that some combination of partial oxidation and steam reforming of methanol was technically the leading candidate for on-board generation of hydrogen for automotive propulsion [61]. Nevertheless, the possible use of methanol suffers from a lack of infrastructure and solubility in water combined with toxicity effects. Methanol's disadvantages have stimulated extensive current research employing renewable primary fuels for this purpose, such as ethanol [2,58,59]. Methanol was the fuel of choice for on-board hydrogen generation in fuel cell prototype cars until the early 2000s, in particular due to advances in catalysis. However, the major world automobile manufacturers have moved away from this technology and now favour on-board hydrogen storage."
7,Hydrogen from biofuels,"4.1 Hydrogen from biofuels Brazil has had a serious interest in development of alternative energy sources for 30 years, having introduced its National Ethanol Program in 1975 after the international oil crisis of 1973–1974. As a result, the largest-scale development of alcohol fuels in the world has been accomplished, in particular hydrated ethanol for automobiles produced from fermented sugarcane. Total production exceeds 3 billion gallons/year [62]. Since only 33% of the primary energy content into the ethanol fuel is converted, it is important to investigate alternative technologies for increasing the production efficiency. One such option is the conversion of biomass into hydrogen, which is being investigated by several research providers [62,63]. Fuel conversion to hydrogen is an important part of most fuel cell systems. The available technologies for conversion of hydrocarbons and alcohols are catalytic steam and autothermal reforming. Recent developments include catalytic partial oxidation. The integration of the fuel processing with the fuel cell represents a task with requirements depending on each type of fuel cell and application [2]. Steam reforming of ethanol has been suggested as an alternative method of hydrogen production [58,59,64,65]. The main reactions involved are the breakage of a carbon bond (Eq. (1)) and the water gas shift (Eq. (2)) [2,64,65] as follows: (1) C2H5OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2 (2) CO+H2O→CO2 +H2 A physico-chemical, thermodynamic, and exergetic analysis of a steam reformer of ethanol, in order to produce 0.7Nm3/h of hydrogen as feedstock of a 1kW PEM fuel cell was performed by Brazilian researchers [59]. Superheated ethanol reacts with steam at high temperatures producing H2 and CO2, depending strongly on the thermodynamic conditions of reforming, as well as on the technical features of the reformer system and catalysts. The thermodynamic analysis shows the feasibility of this reaction in temperatures of about 206°C. Optimal temperatures range between 600 and 700°C. At higher temperatures, the heat use is very high, involving high costs of production due to the higher volume of fuel or electricity supplied [59]. The risk of carbon formation by steam reforming of ethanol can be eliminated with an adiabatic pre-reformer. Conversions at temperatures <500°C in simple fixed bed reactors with steam produce methane, hydrogen, and carbon oxides at conditions where carbon formation does not occur. If a pre-reformer is used, it is possible to use temperatures >650°C for internal reforming in MCFC or SOFC [2]."
8,"Hydrogen from hydro, solar and wind power","4.2 Hydrogen from hydro, solar and wind power Hydrogen allows a high efficiency conversion through water electrolysis – higher than 70%, having already achieved 90% [47]. Nevertheless, water electrolysis remains a cost-intensive process due the massive use of electricity. Alternatives of energy supply for water electrolysis have been studied, including the use of renewable sources, such as hydro, solar and wind power. An exergetic life cycle assessment of hydrogen production using solar and wind power compared to production from fossil fuels was performed recently [5]. The use of wind power to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, and its application in a fuel cell vehicle, exhibits the lowest consumption rate. However, the economic attractiveness of renewable technologies depends significantly on the ratio of costs for hydrogen and natural gas. At the present, capital investments are about five times lower to produce hydrogen via natural gas rather than wind or solar energy. As a consequence, the cost of wind and solar based electricity and hydrogen is substantially higher than that of natural gas [5]. Feasibility for implementing a hypothetical 30MW electrolytic hydrogen production plant in the north-east of Brazil, using alternative renewable power sources (wind, solar, and hydroelectricity) [66] was recently carried out suggesting that the production of 56.26×106 m3 H2/year at a cost of 10.3US$/kg, a reasonable cost according to the current literature [67,68]."
9,Greenhouse gas emissions,"Fig. 8 provides an indication of the relative costs and levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of energy delivered by various fuels, including gaseous and liquid hydrogen, produced by different routes. The levels of GHG include those released in the fuel production, and during its complete combustion under ideal conditions [7]. The hydrogen costs delivered to the end-user will generally be significantly higher than the costs of current fossil fuel options. However, hydrogen in some cases (e.g. gaseous hydrogen produced by large scale reforming of natural gas) could be delivered today at a cost that would be comparable to, or cheaper than, liquid fossil fuel costs. Hydrogen similarly produced could also be delivered at a cost competitive with alternative fuels, notably biofuels (ethanol or biodiesel) [7], considering that fossil based hydrogen production is usually combined with cost-intensive purification processes. This is the case of desulphurising liquid or gaseous fossil fuels to avoid poisoning of catalysts or SO x formation. In addition carbon capture and sequestration may be applicable to fossil fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The cost of hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources is likely to be reduced with the advancement in these non-conventional technologies. In addition, prudent introduction of hydrogen would result in reduced external costs associated with energy conversion in power generation and transport because of reduced air pollution and associated health impacts and climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with hydrogen produced from renewable primary sources are generally low, but not necessarily zero. They may include elements of emissions associated with energy consumption from conventional sources such as hydrogen compression, liquefaction, and distribution or storage. The high conversion efficiency of fuel cells could further reduce the gap between conventional fossil fuels and hydrogen. The potential for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources is believed to be large, but remains a subject of debate [7]."
10,Fuel cells,"Although the fuel cell installed capacity in Brazil is limited, several government-funded research activities have been carried out in many universities and institutes. These activities began in the late 1980s and the number of organizations involved has increased steadily over the decades to approximately 30–35 [37]. In 2002, the Brazilian government started a Fuel Cell Program (Procac) [69]. Initially three main networks were formed to support cooperative research and development in solid oxide fuel cell systems, polymeric electrolyte fuel cell systems, and hydrogen production. In 2005, Procac was renamed ProH2 or program of science, technology and innovation for the hydrogen economy. The two major government supporting agencies are the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) [1] and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) [70]. The latter is a major funding agency with its programs CT-Energ (Energy Fund), CT-Petro (Fund for oil and natural gas) and CT-Infra (Infrastructure Fund). Other government related organizations that play an important and active role in Brazil's fuel cell program are the Federal Foundation for Research and Development (FINEP) [71], which supports private companies, the National Council for Research and Development (CNPq) [72] and the State of São Paulo's Research Foundation (FAPESP) [73]."
11,Types and characteristics,"6.1 Types and characteristics Fuel cells offer much higher power generation efficiencies than conventional generation systems, based on engines and turbines, and the preferred fuel for these technologies is hydrogen. There are seven main types of fuel cell [64,74–76] as listed in Table 6 , which shows typical efficiencies operating temperature, catalysts and other operation parameters. The low temperature proton exchange membrane (also known as polymer electrolyte) fuel cell (PEMFC or PEM) and the alkaline fuel cell (AFC) require hydrogen with less than 10ppm CO, whereas the phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) can tolerate up to 1% CO in the feed. Direct methanol or ethanol fuel cells (DMFC and DEFC, respectively) are indeed PEM fuel cells, which use these alcohols directly as fuels. The high temperature molten carbonate (MCFC) and solid oxide (SOFC) fuel cells can run on fuels containing higher concentrations of CO. The AFC requires an oxidant of either pure oxygen or CO2-free air, and so has not been favoured by developers for any applications other than niche markets. The PEM fuel cell has been chosen by most of the automotive companies as the power source for future vehicles. The PAFC is the most developed in terms of hardware and demonstrations, but has been overtaken recently by the PEM fuel cell. Current low temperature fuel cells (PEM, DMFC, DEFC, PAFC) make extensive use of catalysts. Impurities may poison the catalysts reducing activity and efficiency [56]. The high temperature fuel cells (MCFC and SOFC) are capable of converting hydrocarbon or alcohol-derived fuels in the anode chamber by internal reforming, resulting in a higher electric efficiency [2,77]."
12,Research and development,"6.2 Research and development According to the ISI Web of Knowledge, as of 31 December 2007, exactly 253 articles on the subject ‘fuel cells’ and related topics were published with the participation of at least one researcher linked to a Brazilian institution [78]. Fig. 9 shows an increasing number of articles on this research subject, markedly from 2000 onwards. The publications were classified by fuel cell type. For simplicity sake, each paper was classified into one category only, related to the main focused type of fuel cell. Many papers, classified as ‘general’ deal with hydrogen production and/or purification by steam reforming or water gas shift reaction with the use of catalysts. Fig. 10 shows the relative percentages of each fuel cell type research for all articles analysed. A large number of publications deal with PEM (112 articles or 47%) and SOFC (32 articles or 13%). An equivalent of 34% of the articles was considered to be of a general approach. Only 6% cited the less common types AFC, PAFC and MCFC, corresponding to a worldwide trend. Included in the PEM fuel cell type are DEFC (11 articles) and DMFC (24 articles), which play an important role in the context of Brazilian research activities. The first internationally indexed papers written by Brazilian researchers were published in 1986 and 1988, respectively, on PA fuel cells developed in the Institute of Chemistry, University of São Paulo (USP) at São Carlos [79,80]. A small number of PAFC articles were further published [81–83] and there are a few number of PAFC units installed and operational in Brazil. In 2001, a 200kW PAFC unit was reported to be the first commercial fuel cell to operate in Latin America. The system was provided by International Fuel Cells (IFC) to Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL) [84]. MCFC is cited three times only [85–87], focusing on numerical simulation or theoretical models. Alkaline fuel cells are also a minor concern in Brazil [88–90]. PEM cells appeared in the Brazilian references first in 1994 [91]. Lab-scale single and multiple cell assemblies of PEM fuel cells were reported to be built in Brazil for the first time, respectively, in 1996 and 1998 [92,93]. SOFC electrolytes based on typical yttria-stabilized zirconia were mentioned in the Brazilian literature for the first time in 2000 [94]. Only SOFC single cells have been mounted and tested so far by Brazilian researchers [95–97]. The following sections will present a brief description of efforts carried out in Brazilian institutions to develop and adapt technologies to PEM (including DMFC and DEFC) and SOFC systems, which represent the vast majority of the published work and applied research currently undertaken countrywide. Furthermore, the field of reforming and catalysis is addressed with emphasis on renewable ethanol as cell fuel. The results in this area are generally applied to PEM and DEFC. Table 7 summarizes the key information on fuel cell R&D in major Brazilian institutions and respective main investigation topics. 6.2.1 PEM, DMFC, DEFC and catalysts PEM fuel cell is an area of research that has received much attention in the Brazilian community, and likewise around the world. These systems can operate at low temperature, providing advantages in materials development and process operation as compared to high temperature SOFC. In addition, Brazil has a strong tradition in R&D in polymer science. Many of the work published involves preparation and characterization of polyethersulfone (PES) [98], and novel mixed conductive polymeric matrices involving polyaniline and SPEEK [99]. Electronic and protonic conductivity values of these electrolytes were in the order of magnitude currently afforded by PEM fuel cells. The sample blends were stable up to 230°C [100]. In a PEM fuel cell, the oxidation of any fuel requires the use of a catalyst in order to achieve the current densities to meet commercial engineering requirements. Platinum-based catalysts are of the most efficient materials for the oxidation of small organic molecules. Nevertheless, these catalysts are expensive, so practical application of ethanol as fuel for PEM fuel cells requires new catalysts. Catalyst development is another area in which Brazil has a strong network of research providers. Many of the research groups have been investigating catalysts for PEM and DMFC, and are consolidating their efforts in the development of catalysts for reformed ethanol in PEM and DEFC. Co/Al2O3, Co/SiO2, and Co/MgCF catalysts were prepared and tested for their activity and stability for steam reforming of ethanol. All materials showed high levels of ethanol conversion, with hydrogen molar yields of about 70% and 30% CO+CO2 +CH4 in the gaseous mixture. After 9h of reaction, 14–24% of carbon was deposited on all catalysts, indicating that a well characterized deactivation of the materials is due to coke deposition [101,102]. In DEFC systems, ethanol crossover causes a less serious effect compared to that of methanol because of both its smaller permeability through the Nafion membrane and its slower electrochemical oxidation kinetics on a Pt/C cathode. The main interest in DEFCs is to find an anode catalyst with high activity for the oxidation of ethanol [103,104]. A commercial carbon supported Pt-Co/C as cathode material was tested at 60–100°C, which outperformed Pt-C both in terms of mass activity and specific activity [105]. Further research work was carried out on a carbon supported Pt–Sn alloy catalyst prepared by the reduction of Pt and Sn precursors with formic acid. The electrocatalytic activity for ethanol oxidation was compared with a commercial catalyst. The latter showed a higher current performance as anode material in a DEFC operating at 90 and 110°C [106]. A carbon supported Pt–Sn electrocatalyst was thermally treated at 200 and 500°C. The best activity for the ethanol oxidation reaction in a single DEFC was performed by the catalyst thermally treated at 200°C [107]. Moreover, the steam reforming of ethanol was studied at 400°C on a single and on a double bed system with different catalysts. All catalytic systems had shown average conversion of 90% for the steam reforming of ethanol at 400°C. Hydrogen is the main constituent of the reaction effluent, which also contains CO, CO2, and CH4 [108]. Ni based catalysts have also been extensively synthesized and characterized for steam reforming of ethanol. Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were modified with La and Ag. Ni/La-Al2O3 catalysts became inactive at low temperatures, and the catalyst activity was regenerated with the reduction of NiO by ethanol by raising the reaction temperature. A reaction process mechanism for ethanol reactions with H2O on Ni surfaces was proposed based on the reaction test [109]. Methanol and ethanol oxidation was also investigated in an acidic medium on Pt electrodes deposited on Ti substrate. The chrono-amperometric experiments for methanol and ethanol oxidation on Ti/Pt increased by almost 934% and 440%, respectively, as compared with Pt bulk [110]. The effect of alumina support was also investigated using Ni as the active metal. Better activities were reported for H2 production using Ni on gamma-Al2O3 rather than alpha-Al2O3. Metal loading did not affect the catalytic performance. Al2O3 and NiAl2O3 spherical catalysts were produced from a chitosan and Al solution for steam reforming of ethanol and methane. The Ni/Al2O3 spheres showed high catalytic activity in ethanol steam reforming and hydrogen selectivity at temperatures between 450 and 650°C [111]. The catalytic activity of the materials obtained was also shown to be active and stable in relation to the catalytic decomposition of the methane reaction [112]. Autothermal reforming of methane, combining steam reforming and partial oxidation was carried out with Pt catalysts on different substrates at 400–900°C. The Pt-ZrO2/Al2O3 catalyst was found to be the most active and stable at 800°C due to the higher resistance to coke formation [113]. The removal of CO from hydrogen-rich stream was investigated to achieve a tolerant level by selective oxidation over various catalysts. Nb2O5-supported Pt catalysts presented higher activity at low temperatures, but with lower CO selectivity [114]. Catalysts supported on ceria and zirconia presented higher activity than alumina and silica supported catalysts at low temperatures, but lower CO conversions [115]. Further work investigates the performance of different combinations of metal and supports of catalysts for partial oxidation of ethanol for PEM cells. For instance, Co, Pd and Pt were tested on CeO2 substrates [116], and Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 were used as supports for Pt catalysts [117]. The results showed that the correct metal to support concentration played an important role on the products distribution of the partial oxidation of ethanol. There are also several research institutions developing catalysts for PEM. A novel approach was proposed for the manipulation of biodegradable chitosan and poly(vinyl sulfonic acid). The Pt/chitosan/PVS electrode displayed electro-reduction of molecular oxygen, with potential application as layers between the catalysts and the proton exchange membrane in DMFC and DEFC [118]. RuO2 and/or IrO2 were also mixed with Pt particles to produce catalysts for DMFC [119,120]. Pt–RuO2 catalysts in the form of pure powder or supported on carbon powder substrate were prepared and the catalytic activity evaluated towards methanol oxidation. Electrochemical experiments showed that the catalytic activity of the mixed electrodes towards methanol oxidation was higher than that of Pt [121]. The catalytic activity of RuO2/Pt and/or IrO2/Pt on Ti substrates toward the anodic oxidation of methanol was compared in terms of onset potential and current density and was found to follow the sequence: Pt–Ru0.5Ir0.5O2 >Pt–RuO2 >Pt–IrO2 [120]. Moreover, electrocatalysts of Pt–Ru/C [121–124], Pt–Ru-Mo/C [122,123], Pt–Sn/C [123] and Pt–Sn-Ni/C [125] were synthesized and successfully used for the oxidation of ethanol and methanol for PEM fuel cells. Concepts of nanotechnology have been applied to fuel cell supports and catalysts. Carbon fibers and carbon nanotubes were presented as advantageous support for Pt–Ru catalysts in methanol oxidation [126,127]. Pt70Co30 nanocatalysts were produced and homogeneously dispersed on a carbon support, showing a high performance as PEM cathode [128]. Models have been developed to evaluate the performance of PEM fuel cells. For example, the effect of water transport in a PEM at low temperatures operating with dry hydrogen was successfully modelled as a function of the thickness of membranes (Nafion 115 and 117). The water transport through the membrane was a limiting effect for the cell behaviour at high current densities [129]. A recent paper [130] considers the effects of different types of faults on a PEM fuel cell model. A graphical-probabilistic structure for fault diagnosis was constructed using databases and probabilistic methods such as the Bayesian-Score and Monte Carlo [130]. A review on the electrocatalysis of hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions which take place in PEM fuel cell electrodes was published recently. In this review many references on electrocatalysis modelling are given [131]. 6.2.2 SOFC Brazilian researchers have investigated SOFC materials and assemblies such as electrolytes of YSZ-MgO [94], YSZ-TiO2 [132], Y2O3-CeO2 [133], MnO-CeO2 [134], GdO2-CeO2 [135], cathodes of LSM [136,137] and composites [137], and anodes of NiO-YSZ [138]. Reports on the single cells tests of these materials have shown good reproducibility and reasonable performance for operation between 700 and 800°C [95]. An important aspect of SOFC assembly is the contact between LSM cathode and YSZ electrolyte. The formation of insulating phases at the electrode/electrolyte interface occurred, leading to degradation of the microstructure [139]. LSM porous electrode degraded faster than the dense one, due to grain growth and coalescence during annealing at temperatures >1200°C [140]. SOFC assemblies using tape casting and screen printing techniques were also investigated. Water-based slurries were cast [141] and YSZ tapes were thermo-pressed to form electrolyte laminates. LSM cathodes and NiO-YSZ anodes were screen printed on YSZ commercial electrolytes. Cells were tested at 950°C under hydrogen and methane atmospheres, and the electrochemical performance of the electrodes was evaluated through graphics of potential and power density versus current density [96]. The SOFC configuration usually investigated is planar and electrolyte-supported [96,97]. A recent study on development and testing of anode-supported SOFC with slurry-coated electrolyte and cathode was successfully reported [95]. Efforts have also been made to use hydrogen from steam reformed ethanol as a fuel for SOFC, both worldwide [65,142–144] and in Brazil [77,145]. Ni and Co catalysts supported on YSZ were synthesized for the hydrogen production from various fuel mixtures [97,145]. This catalyst was tested in an ethanol steam reforming reactor at very low water concentration, to emulate the SOFC operation. The catalyst was also used as an anode of a unitary SOFC and was reported to have good performance [97,145]. Modelling work of SOFC operating in several regimes is also in progress to determine the efficiency of an SOFC from thermodynamic parameters, operating with hydrogen and including reactions between adsorbed species. An efficiency of about 44% was estimated for the investigated system [146]. Additional modelling work showed that by applying the thermodynamic equilibrium to an SOFC as a reversible system [87], the estimated efficiency reached higher values. Recent reviews on solid oxide fuel cells and related fields from a Brazilian perspective, which are of interest can be found elsewhere [76,77,147]."
13,Partnership and commercialization,"6.3 Partnership and commercialization A few Brazilian companies are involved with the fabrication and commercialization of fuel cells, mainly concerned with PEM components and systems. Typically these small or middle sized companies were created by former researchers from universities or institutes where the partnership with the parent academic organization is normally maintained. Electrocell is commercializing PEM fuel cells for a number of applications [148]. The company is located at CIETEC, Brazil's largest technology centre in São Paulo city. The company produces units in the 25–75W range for demonstration and education purposes, 1.2kW units for laboratory use, and 5–50kW systems for residential applications. Other products include reformers, electrolysers, and power electronics. Furthermore, Electrocell has a contract with the Fuel Cell Laboratory of the Nuclear and Energy Research Institute (IPEN). Both Electrocell and IPEN are located in the campus of the University of São Paulo (USP). NovoCell is a fully Brazilian 2004 start-up company whose objective is to develop and to produce PEM fuel cells to be used as power generators [149]. NovoFilme is an R&D and consultant company that search for new materials and components on fuel cell and ion exchange business [150]. Both companies are based in Americana, São Paulo state. The companies work together with the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) and USP and is a major customer of Electrocell. UNICAMP is presently in technological agreements with NovoFilme to make field plates that are based on carbon fiber composites. UNICAMP has also technology development partnership with Hytron on the commercializing of small size reformers (5–10m3 H2) [151]. CEMIG, the Energy Company of Minas Gerais state, has developed DEFC prototypes for distributed energy applications in partnership with the Clamper company, a local supplier of engineering services, as well as with the São Paulo based UniTech company and university researchers, in particular with UFMG [152]. The Energy Company of Paraná state (COPEL) and the Institute of Technology for Development (LACTEC), both located in Curitiba, are operating each one a 200kW PAFC unit since 2001 and 2002, respectively [153]. Both institutions develop projects on use of natural gas and ethanol as fuels for PAFC [154]. Many worldwide petroleum processing companies are watching with interest developments of hydrogen related technologies and forming partnerships accordingly. This is also the case of Petrobras, an internationally operating energy company in Brazil and leader in Latin America [17]. The company has shown interest in hydrogen and reforming of fuels into hydrogen in recent years and its Centre of Research and Development (CENPES) formed a partnership with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A 200kW PAFC unit was installed at CENPES in 2002 [153]."
14,National and international networking,"6.4 National and international networking The Reference Centre for Hydrogen Energy (CENEH) [155] is a Brazilian government-supported association founded in 2001, which aims to promote the use of hydrogen. The CENEH is coordinated by the Hydrogen Laboratory, created in 1974 [156] and located at the Institute of Physics, UNICAMP. Since 2002, CENEH has organized biannual workshops on fuel cells, which have discussed the state-of-the-art of this field in Brazil and in leading European and North-American countries [157]. In November 2003 the International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE) [158] was launched in Washington, D.C., USA. Brazil is one the members, together with Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, UK and USA. IPHE's goal is to efficiently organize and coordinate multinational research, development and deployment programs that advance the transition to a global hydrogen economy. The IPHE partners' economies represent over US$ 35 trillion in GDP, equivalent to 85% of world GDP. The nations engaged in the association correspond to nearly 3.5 billion people. This population consumes over 75% of the electricity used worldwide, and is responsible for more than 67% of CO2 emissions and energy consumption [159]. In 2004 with the support of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology three Brazilian networks on fuel cells were created: SOFC, PEM and Hydrogen Production. Later two other networks were formed: Systems, Integration and Use, and Norms and Standards [160]. The goals of such networks are to enhance the cooperation between research groups and industries and to foster human resources formation on fuel cells and related themes. Since 2005, the Hydrogen Laboratory at UFRJ has organized annual seminars on SOFC with the participation of invited lecturers from prominent international research institutes [161]. In 2001, the GEF (Global Environment Facility) – an arm of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) – started a fuel cell project to deliver initially five buses to the city of São Paulo, at a total cost of US$ 16 million, which will be managed by the local transport company EMTU (Municipal Urban Transport Company) [37]. The project is technically supported by eight companies, among them two Canadian enterprises: Ballard Power Systems, responsible for designing, developing and fabrication of PEM fuel cells, and Hydrogenics, provider of the dispensers for the hydrogen fuel, which will be produced by electrolysis [162]. Further cooperative work between Brazilian and foreigner groups on R&D of fuel cells and hydrogen economy are being held with Germany [74,99,100,163,164], Italy [82,105–107], France [103,104,119], USA [130], Australia [165], among many other countries."
15,Discussion,"The production of hydrogen for a future hydrogen economy will depend on several factors, which may constrain or benefit the uptake of hydrogen as an energy carrier. In the context of environmental imperatives, a carbon constrained economy will spur the development of hydrogen generation processes and fuel cells technology. The Kyoto Protocol, which has been ratified by the majority of world nations, was the first global concerted effort to address the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide. Rising temperature and climate change are strong arguments to shift our society's behaviour towards a more environmentally benign fuel matrix, or implement carbon capture and storage technologies. The major issue, however, is that our world economies are still driven by large energy consumption directly derived from fossil fuels. Hence, a transition towards renewable energy sources for hydrogen production may take years or even decades. To address this gap, it is likely that fossil fuels will continue to be the major hydrogen source, generated from processes such as coal gasification and natural gas reforming. Nevertheless, moving towards a less dependable fossil fuel matrix is highly desirable, in particular in terms of energy security. In this context, there are perhaps just a few countries in the world with a diverse energy matrix robust enough, and Brazil is in a unique situation where at least 45% energy supply is derived from renewable resources. Brazil is already a world leader in biofuels production for the transportation sector, and there is a strong case for Brazil to also lead the production of hydrogen from renewable resources. Brazil has a large hydroelectric power output and developments in electrolysis efficiency and cost reduction could provide the technological leap towards cheap production of hydrogen. In addition, off-peak hydroelectric power is always cheap, another attractive option available in Brazil. So what are the impediments? Economics is always a major impediment. This can be in the form of fuel cost or technology cost. Excluding the issues associated with hydrogen transportation and storage infrastructure, fuel cell technology will have to compete against traditional combustion engine technology. The latter has been developed for over a century, and major improvements in efficiencies occurred in the last 20 year with the implementation of injection fuel and engine management. Although fuel cells are more efficient than combustion engines, a PEM fuel cell stack is expensive as it requires precious metals such as platinum. Furthermore, the manufacturing costs of fuel cell technology have yet to experience the cycles of cost reduction and optimisation, as occurred for the combustion engines in the last 100 years. Nevertheless, SOFC fuel cells are making inroads into the stationary energy supply market. Albeit a niche market, data processing companies (i.e. banks and telecommunications), which process several thousand transactions per minute cannot afford the luxury of even a few seconds of power shortage in their computer systems. Hence, fuel cells can provide the certainty of power supply as required by this market segment. Also, remote sites not linked to an electrical grid can benefit from electricity supplied by stationary fuel cell systems. In the case of fuel costs, hydrogen will be competing against petrol and ethanol in Brazil. The continuous depletion of oil reserves around the world associated with the affluence of large world population economies such as China and India has catapulted the cost of oil to new heights, reaching US$100 per barrel. In this oil cost trajectory, it is unlikely that hydrogen will be generated from oil. On the other hand, hydrogen can be generated from biomass, including ethanol of which Brazil is the largest world producer. The production of fuels from biomass always generates a dilemma to our society, in particular that food production is replaced by fuel production. This argument is important, and applicable in the case of grains to ethanol, which is not the case in Brazil. By the same token, a large proportion of the world grain production is used for animal feed which can invalidate the argument against grain to energy production. In addition to the Kyoto Protocol, there are currently new directives from leading world economies (e.g. European Union) towards carbon emission reduction. In a carbon constraint economy, production of hydrogen from fossil fuels will only occur if the emitted carbon can be captured and stored safely. However, our society will have to tolerate the extra cost associated with a near zero carbon emission. At the moment, a potential candidate would be coal gasification, as coal is the most abundant fossil fuel in the world with reserves that would outlast natural gas and oil for centuries. On the other hand, renewable resources can play a major role in hydrogen production. For instance, biomass is almost carbon neutral, as the carbon emitted to the atmosphere is the same carbon that the plants take up from the atmosphere. We have already ascertained the great potential for hydrogen production in Brazil from renewable resources. As the fifth largest country in the world, the large continental dimensions of Brazil dictates that the production of hydrogen will depend upon regional environmental and economic conditions. The major sources available are biomass (ethanol and biodiesel) and water (hydroelectric power). Ethanol and hydropower have extensive distribution infrastructure already in place, while biodiesel production and use is increasingly being stimulated by the government. In the north-east region, wind and solar energy seems to be an alternative with great potential. Non-renewable sources are expected to play a minor role as the Brazilian coal reserves are relatively small, though it may benefit the Southern States of Brazil. Although natural gas in the North-eastern States may eventually play an important role in hydrogen production via reforming processes, the price of natural gas may prove to be prohibitive in the near future due to the world's high demand. One of the major variables in the hydrogen economy equation is hydrogen infrastructure. This begs the question as to whether hydrogen would be generated at the source for transportation and storage, or close to the end-user. In the Brazilian context, large cities where the potential hydrogen markets reside are separated by long distances. In addition, liquid hydrogen has a low energy density per volume (0.5MJl−1) as compared to diesel (36MJl−1). So hydrogen transportation (liquefied or compressed) coupled with large distances between the major cities in Brazil is not economically feasible, thus favouring centralised or distributed production closer to the end-user. A summary of some of the relevant influencing factors in selecting a suitable source of renewable energy for producing hydrogen in Brazil is listed in Table 8 . It can be ascertained qualitatively that ethanol and hydro resources have extensive infrastructure, which could spear point the hydrogen production in Brazil closer to the end-user. Since the late 1980s there has been growing interest in fuel cell technology which has been accompanied by huge investments of many companies worldwide, in particular in Canada. The fuel cell bandwagon subsequently gathered momentum with European, Japanese and USA companies working on several designs for energy supply and transportation. The research, development and deployment of fuel cells have been supported by both industry and government agencies. Although the initial hype of fuel cell cars by 2005 has not materialised, all the global motor vehicle manufactures have fuel cell car prototypes and production delivery is scheduled to 2015–2020. Fuel cell research and development in Brazil has been subdued by the successful development of the flex-fuel combustion engine, which can operate with any petrol and ethanol mixture. Although the installed capacity of stationary fuel cell units worldwide is ∼130MW, [166], the Brazilian fuel cell power delivery is very limited – only ∼1MW, mainly in four PAFC demonstration units [153]. However, Brazil is currently undertaking a building research capacity program in fuel technology, demonstrated by research networks on the development of PEM and SOFC. As the research output of the Brazilian networks are now being realised – evident by ∼100 publications in 2007 (see Fig. 9) – it is expected that a new breed of graduates will provide the basis for the development of fuel cell fabrication and installation capabilities in Brazil. Until this capability is fully developed, it is likely that fuel cell stacks will be purchased from overseas suppliers, while engineering design, assembly and ancillary balance of plant can be easily provided by Brazilian companies. Pursuing a clean energy delivery slate is a major bonus of the current research programs in Brazil. This is reflected by research in catalysis and reforming of ethanol by several research providers. There is a concerted research effort to use hydrogen from steam reformed ethanol as a fuel for PEM and SOFC, or to use ethanol directly in DEFC overcoming both the hydrogen storage and transportation issues. Brazil has a large hydroelectric power capacity, and further research on electrolysis could be realised to provide a breakthrough in hydrogen production. Some of the strategies being contemplated by the transportation sector include the production of hydrogen using electrolysis close to the end-user. As water and hydroelectric power are abundant, Brazil could lead the implementation of cheap and renewable source hydrogen for fuel cell utilisation."
16,Conclusions,"This review highlights Brazil's national energy strategy, in particular focusing on the future role of hydrogen as an energy carrier for the power and transportation sectors. These strategies are likely to become more important as current policies focus on the development of novel environmentally friendly pathways to future energy supply. Given Brazil's high reliance on renewable energy sources, mainly hydroelectric power and biomass fuels, the government foresees such feedstock as the basis for hydrogen energy production. Brazil is currently building capacity in fuel cell technology. Three main networks have been formed since 2002 to support cooperative research and development on fuel cells (SOFC, PEM), cell fuels and catalysts. Efforts have been made to use hydrogen from steam reformed ethanol as a fuel for PEM and SOFC, or instead to use ethanol directly in DEFC overcoming both the hydrogen storage and transportation issues. Brazil has the largest sugarcane crop, and is the largest producer and exporter of ethanol in the world. Ethanol can be considered as almost carbon neutral and does not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect. Nevertheless, practical application of ethanol as fuel for PEM or DEFC fuel cells needs new catalysts, thus requiring further development, optimisation and deployment. Potential outfalls may be realised by improvements in electrolysis. Brazil's electric hydropower network delivers 85% of the power requirement. This power can be utilised during off-peak periods to produce hydrogen. As water is a resource generally available and abundant in many areas, Brazil could possibly provide one of the most attractive hydrogen production networks in the world. Potential benefits of the hydrogen network would be the economically feasible production and delivery of hydrogen at major urban centres and close to the user end."
