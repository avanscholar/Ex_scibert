0,Introduction,"Fuel cells with proton exchange membranes (PEMFCs) are considered one of the most interesting alternatives to the traditional internal combustion engine for the production of energy for car-traction [1,2]. Although, on principle, the PEMFCs can work with different fuels from the simplest hydrocarbons to alcohols, the present technology is limited to the employment of H2, but the feeding of the motor-vehicles with hydrogen could cause problems for the fuel tank construction, for the filling stations and, above all, for the safety. Thus, an idea is now spreading to associate the fuel cells with reactors for hydrocarbons and alcohols reforming. The reactor should work at a relatively low temperature and be able to feed the cell with the hydrogen produced during the reaction. Among the fuels to be reformed, methanol is very attractive for its low cost, the high H/C ratio and the absence of coke formation [3]. Recently, an interesting methanol reforming process, named Oxidative Steam Reforming of Methanol (OSRM), has been proposed and is under study in various academic and industrial laboratories [4,5]. OSRM combines the two reactions: (1) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H ° = 49.3 kJ mol − 1 (2) CH 3 OH + 1 / 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 Δ H ° = − 191.9 kJ mol − 1 endothermic steam reforming (1) and exothermic partial oxidation (2) and can be carried out in autothermic conditions if the reactor is fed with mixtures of CH3OH, H2O and O2 in proper concentration ratio. The reforming process must not produce CO, since this by-product, even in ppm amounts, damages the fuel cell operation [6]. Hence, the ideal OSRM catalysts should possess, beside high chemical, thermal and mechanical endurance to operate for long time with many working cycles in the presence of water vapour and oxygen, a high surface area and chemical properties (redox, acid–base) to selectively activate the reagents for CO2 and H2 production. Literature data indicate that good catalysts are obtained with systems based on metallic copper well dispersed into zinc and/or aluminium oxides [7–9]. A relatively simple way to obtain such systems consists in preparing catalyst precursors constituted of Cu, Zn, Al hydroxycarbonates with hydrotalcite structure [4,5,10]. The hydrotalcite-like compounds, also known as anionic clays or lamellar double hydroxides, are practically the unique example of lamellar solids having lamellae with positive charges balanced with exchangeable anions accommodated in the interlayer region. Their general formula is [M(II)1−x M(III) x (OH)2](A x/n )·mH2O, where M(II)=Mg, Zn, Ni, Cu, Mn; M(III)=Al, Cr, Fe; x =0.2–0.4; An- is the intercalated anion of charge n; m =mol/mol of co-intercalated water. The structure of the lamellae is of brucite type and comes out from the linkage through corners of M(OH)6 octahedra where M is the bivalent or trivalent metal. More than one bivalent or trivalent metal can be introduced in the brucite layer to achieve a large variety of composition [11,12]. In any case, the brucite layer is constituted of metal cations interdispersed at atomic level and ternary hydrotalcites of the type Cu x Zn0.67−x Al0.33(OH)2(CO3)0.17, calcined and reduced with a hydrogen flow can lead to catalysts containing Cu highly dispersed on ZnO and Al2O3. In this line, previous works [4,5] have shown that thermal decomposition and reduction of ternary hydrotalcites produces catalysts that show high catalytic performances in terms of methanol conversion and high selectivity to produce H2 and CO2. It was thus of interest to prepare Cu–Zn–Al hydrotalcite precursors with different composition in order to obtain new catalysts for the OSRM process. In this work a series of hydrotalcite precursors with nominal formula Cu1−x−y Zn y Al x (OH)2(CO3) x/2 (x =0.23−0.42, y =0.31−0.58) have been prepared by homogeneous precipitation from metal chlorides accomplished by urea hydrolysis [13]. The materials have been characterised by chemical and thermal analyses, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and BET surface areas and the catalysts thereby obtained have been used in OSRM process with the aim to obtain information on the effect of Cu, ZnO and Al2O3 molar ratio on the efficiency of the reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthetic procedures and chemical analyses,"2.1 Synthetic procedures and chemical analyses The hydrotalcite precursors were obtained with urea method [13]. Aqueous solutions, obtained by mixing solutions 0.5 M of AlCl3, ZnCl2 and CuCl2 in the proper volume ratio, were added of solid urea until the molar ratio urea/Al(III) was 6 and then refluxed for 3 days. The precipitates obtained were separated from the mother solutions, washed with deionised water and then suspended in a 0.05 M Na2CO3 solution (about 20 mL/g of precipitate) for 1 day, in order to exchange chloride ions, eventually present in the hydrotalcite materials, with carbonate anions. After equilibration with the Na2CO3 solution the solids were recovered, washed with deionised water and finally dried at room temperature over P4O10. The catalysts were obtained by heating the precursors in dry airflow at rate of 2 or 10 °C min−1 up to 450 °C and maintaining it at this temperature for 12 h. Then the samples were reduced in situ with 2% H2/He mixtures. The reducing treatments were effected before characterization measurements. The metal ions contents were obtained by ion chromatography, after dissolution of the samples in concentrated HCl. Carbonate and water contents were evaluated from thermo gravimetrical analysis."
3,Instrumentation and catalytical characterisation,"2.2 Instrumentation and catalytical characterisation XRPD patterns of the samples were recorded with a computer controlled Philips PW1710 diffractometer using Cu–Kα Ni-filtered radiation (40 kV, 30 mA). XRPD patterns at programmed temperatures have been taken in a HT A. Paar diffraction camera. TG analyses were performed in air by a Netzsch STA449C Thermal Analyser at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at −196 °C, on samples previously degassed at 100 °C, using a computer controlled Micromeritics 2010 apparatus. The IR spectra were recorded with a Nicolet Protégé 460 Fourier Transform instrument. A Micromeritics 2900 apparatus equipped with a TCD detector was employed for Temperature Programmed Reduction/Oxidation (TPR and TPO) measurements. TPR measurements were carried out on calcined samples at a rate of 10 °C min−1 using a 5% H2/Ar mixture. Catalytic activity measurements are carried out in a laboratory flow apparatus with a fixed bed reactor. A gas-chromatograph (GC) HP 5890, equipped with a Porapak-molecular sieve double-packed column and a TCD detector, is employed for the analysis of H2, CO, CO2, O2, CH4, CH3OH, H2O. From concentrations and volume of effluent stream, total and partial conversions are calculated. The tests were carried out at T =200–400 °C, feeding with H2O/CH3OH/O2 mixtures at 1.1:1:0.12 molar ratio and space velocity, GHSV=0.6×106 or 1.2×106 h−1."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Precursors preparation and characterisation,"3.1 Precursors preparation and characterisation The Cu–Zn–Al precursors of the OSRM catalysts have been prepared with the urea method. This method generally allows the preparation of different hydrotalcite-like compounds having a high crystallinity degree and a narrow particle size distribution [13]. However, the presence of Cu2+ cations makes the synthetic procedure more complex, at least for two reasons. First, Cu2+ ions show the Jahn-Teller effect that favours the formation of distorted octahedral structures [14], secondarily Cu2+ ions can be depleted by ammonia originated from urea hydrolysis. The preparation of Cu–Zn–Al precursors has required modification of the original urea method. In particular, the molar ratio urea/Al(III) has been decreased from 10 to 6 and addition of the CuCl2 solution has been carried out drop by drop as the Zn–Al hydrotalcite starts to be formed. These modifications allowed to obtain materials having a Cu content near, even if always lower, to that of the starting solutions. Table 1 reports the composition, expressed as % molar ratio of the metal ions content, the phase analysis and the BET surface area of the samples prepared. The XRPD patterns of the precursors are reported in Fig. 1 . The patterns clearly indicate the good crystalline order of the samples. It may be also seen that most of them are biphasic and pure hydrotalcite phases (PDF No. 14-0191) were obtained when the Cu-content was lower than 15% (samples C1u and C2u). At higher Cu-content, a new phase, identified as Zn-rich paratacamite (PDF N. 50-1558) of formula Cu2−x Zn x (OH)3Cl, starts to be formed. The relative amount of the two phases has been evaluated by quantitative Rietveld procedure, using GSAS program [15]. Table 1 shows the increase of paratacamite phase amount with the increasing Cu-content and, correspondingly, a decrease of BET surface areas of related samples. It may be observed that pure paratacamite sample, prepared with the urea method, has a very low surface area when compared with that of pure hydrotalcite phase (sample C1u). These data seem to indicate that the brucite sheet of well-crystallised hydrotalcites is not able to accommodate more than one copper atom every six different metal atoms. If one considers that every metal centre in the brucite sheet is surrounded by six others metal centres, it may be deduced that the brucite layer seems not to tolerate the presence of two contiguous distorted Cu(OH)6 octahedra. It may be recalled that hydrotalcite samples with a higher Cu content can be prepared by the classical precipitation procedure, but the samples obtained have a low degree of crystallinity and the attempts to prepare more crystalline samples produce the segregation of other Cu-rich phases [16]."
6,Catalysts preparation and characterisation,"3.2 Catalysts preparation and characterisation As already mentioned, OSRM catalysts are obtained by calcination and subsequent reduction of the precursors. It was thus of interest to study the thermal behaviour of the precursors. Fig. 2 shows the weight loss curves of the samples prepared as a function of temperature. For sake of comparison, the TG curve of the sample of paratacamite, prepared by the urea method, is also reported. Thermal decomposition of paratacamite occurs in two well differentiated steps. The first one, attributed to the loss of condensation water, is sharp and occurs at 300 °C. The second step, occurring between 450° and 650 °C, is broad and can be attributed to the loss of chlorine, very likely as HCl. At 700 °C only a mixture of Zn and Cu oxides are present. The weight loss curve of the hydrotalcite phase is represented by the curve of the C1u sample. It is constituted by two broad weight losses, the first occurring between room temperature and about 200 °C is mainly attributed to the loss of co-intercalated water, the second loss, between 200° and 450 °C, is attributed to the loss of constitutional water and carbon dioxide and leads to the formation of metal oxides and aluminates. The TG curves of the other precursors show the typical features of the thermal decomposition of hydrotalcite and paratacamite phases. The loss below 150 °C can be attributed to the loss of water co-intercalated with carbonates in the hydrotalcite phase, while the loss over 450 °C to the decomposition of the paratacamite phase. The losses between 150 and 450 °C can be ascribed to the loss of condensation water of hydrotalcite and of paratacamite overlapping with the loss of carbonates. The total weight loss of the precursors is very near to that calculated for the thermal transformation of the precursors into CuO, ZnO and Al2O3 metal oxides. It is, however, difficult to deduce the formula of the mixed phase precursors since Cu and Zn are vicariant metals both in hydrotalcite and paratacamite phases. The thermal decomposition of the precursor has been also monitored by recording the XRPD patterns in a HT diffraction camera. The structure of the hydrotalcite phase collapses at temperatures higher than 180 °C, while the characteristic peak of paratacamite is not present at temperatures higher than 260 °C, in agreement with the TG data. Over 320 °C, very weak reflections typical of the copper and zinc oxides start to appear. To have a better insight of the phases formed at temperatures higher than 320 °C, the XRPD patterns, taken at room temperature, of samples previously heated for three hours in an oven at 450 °C have been collected (see Fig. 3 ). The patterns show diffraction peaks attributable to CuO and ZnO and only broad reflections attributable to zinc (or copper) aluminates. Reflections of Al2O3 are absent. From these data, it appears that treatment at 450 °C is suitable for obtaining catalysts for OSRM. In fact, this temperature is sufficiently high for the formation of metal oxides, but low enough to avoid sintering phenomena that could cause loss of surface area. Subsequent characterisation has been carried out on the C3u sample. TPR signals showed that the reduction of Cu(II) species to Cu(0) occurs in two steps in the 250–400 °C temperature range, and give evidence that the heating rate employed in the thermal treatment influences the crystal size and the homogeneity of the CuO phase. Correspondingly, TPO measurements gave evidence that oxidation of Cu phase occurs in several steps in the temperature range 200–350 °C, suggesting that in the reaction conditions Cu(0), Cu(I) and Cu(II) can be present simultaneously. This was confirmed by IR measurements. Fig. 4 reports the IR spectra of carbon monoxide adsorbed at −160 °C on the catalysts, pre-treated at 300 °C. The adsorption of CO gives rise to a complex band characterised by a maximum at 2128 cm−1 with a shoulder at 2135 cm−1 and two weaker bands at 2163 and 2187 cm−1. According to previous works [17,18], the observed features can be assigned to CO adsorbed on the Zn-aluminate support (2187 cm−1), on Cu2+ sites (2163 cm−1, decreasing in intensity by reduction), on Cu+ centres (2135 cm−1, stable to out gassing at −110 °C) and on Cu metal deduced from the presence of a component at 2128 cm−1, (see inset of Fig. 4), labile even at −110 °C."
7,Preliminary catalytic activity measurements,"3.3 Preliminary catalytic activity measurements Preliminary catalytic activity tests indicated that the catalysts, obtained from precursors listed in Table 1, have a good activity and selectivity, giving almost complete CH3OH conversion with high yield to H2 and absence of CO (detection limit=500 ppm) under conditions of interest for OSRM process. The activity strongly depended on space velocity: for GHSV=1.2×106 h−1, CH3OH conversion was low and O2 conversion negligible at T <300 °C, for GHSV=0.6×106·h−1 CH3OH conversion was markedly higher, reaching 100% at T ≥350 °C. Fig. 5a and b reports the methanol conversion and the H2 yield, respectively as a function of temperature at GHSV=0.6×106 h−1, for three different catalysts. Results obtained with a sample of paratacamite, previously calcined and reduced at 450 °C, are also shown for comparison. It may be seen that all the three catalysts produce a complete methanol conversion at temperatures lower than 400 °C. Of particular interest is the behaviour of samples C2u and C3u that produce an almost complete methanol conversion at temperatures lower than 350 °C and a H2 yield (see Fig. 5b) close to the value 2.76 mol/mol of methanol expected on the basis of feed composition assuming total conversion of O2 and CH3OH. It is interesting to note the poor catalytic efficiency of calcined paratacamite sample. Catalysts obtained by precursors containing a large amount of paratacamite phase, such as the sample C3u bis, show indeed a lower catalytic activity when compared with that of obtained by hydrotalcite-rich precursors. The catalytic activity of sample C2u and a study of the reaction path under OSRM conditions have been objects of a recent work [15]."
8,Conclusion,"The present paper has dealt with the synthesis and preliminary characterization of catalysts in light of their use for methanol reforming reactors. In particular, Cu–Zn–Al hydrotalcite-like materials have been prepared with the urea method, modified to introduce Cu(II) into the brucite sheets. This has allowed to obtain products with fairly high Cu content, however the contemporary formation of Cu–Zn oxychloride (paratacamite phase) could not be avoided, it seems in fact that the layer of brucite type does not tolerate more than 15% of Cu(II) cations in octahedral coordination, due to the Jahn Teller distorsion. However, the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts thereby obtained gave preliminary good results, in terms of CH3OH conversion and H2 yield, together with low CO production and this is a further stimulus to investigate the hydrotalcite system as efficient precursor of very selective OSRM catalysts."
