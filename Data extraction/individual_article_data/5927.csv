0,Effect of ethanol on the polyunsaturated fatty acyl composition of liver,
1,Studies in animals,"1.1 Studies in animals Continuous periods of alcohol consumption have been shown to alter the fatty acyl composition of the whole liver and subcellular compartments in diverse species that were exposed to ethanol through various routes of administration and for varying durations (Corbett et al., 1991; Cunnane et al., 1985; Cunningham et al., 1982, 1983; Lands et al., 1998; Nakamura et al., 1992; Pawlosky & Salem, 1995, 1999; Pawlosky et al., 1997; Salem et al., 1996; Salem & Olsson, 1997; Thompson & Reitz, 1978; Villanueva et al., 1994). In general terms, prolonged periods of alcohol consumption have been found to cause a decrease in the percentage or total amounts (or both) of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (fatty acids having 20 or more carbon atoms) in the liver. For example, Cunningham and co-workers (1983) found that when monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were fed ethanol continuously for 12 months there were lower amounts of arachidonic acid (20:4n6) in the liver mitochondria and microsomes compared with findings for control animals. Results from a study in Yucatan micropigs fed ethanol (40% energy) for 1 year showed that both 20:4n6 and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3) were lower in several organs, including the liver, compared with findings for control animals (Villanueva et al., 1994). Cunnane et al. (1985) found that when ethanol was given to golden Syrian hamsters in their drinking water for 1 year both 20:4n6 and 22:6n3 were lower in the liver triglycerides compared with findings for control animals. Results from studies carried out in both rhesus monkeys and felines at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Intramural Program (Pawlosky & Salem, 1995, 1999; Pawlosky, et al., 1997) demonstrated that prolonged periods of moderate alcohol (from 1.2 to 2.6 g kg−1 d−1) intake were sufficient to reduce the PUFA content of liver ( Table 1). In these studies, animals were maintained on diets with an adequate amount of linoleic acid (18:2n6), but with limited sources of n-3 fatty acids. In the feline study (Pawlosky & Salem, 1995), corn oil supplied the essential fatty acid (EFA) content of the diet, whereas olive oil was used as a source of EFAs in the monkey diet (Pawlosky et al., 1997). Thus, both diets contained very low amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n3) and were nearly devoid of longer chain n-3 fatty acids. The experimental design of the two studies took into account differences in the requirements of the two species with respect to the frequency, route, and duration of ethanol administration. Felines were given oral doses of ethanol in capsules daily for 6 months (equivalent to 1.2 g kg−1 day−1), whereas monkeys were trained to drink an artificially sweetened alcohol solution over a several-year period. The daily mean ethanol consumption in monkeys was 2.6 g of ethanol kg−1 (range, 1.2–4.5 g kg−1). In both the alcohol-consuming rhesus monkeys after 18 months and felines after 6 months, there was approximately a 15% lower concentration of 20:4n6 in the total lipid extracts of livers compared with findings for control animals. There was a more marked effect of alcohol consumption on the liver concentrations of 22:6n3 in both species, a finding also reported by Villanueva et al. (1994) in micropigs. Monkeys consuming alcohol had approximately a 50% lower concentration of 22:6n3 in the liver compared with findings for control animals, whereas, in felines, the decline was 70% (Table 1)."
2,Fatty acyl composition of liver obtained from patients with alcoholic liver disease and primary biliary cirrhosis after transplantation,"1.2 Fatty acyl composition of liver obtained from patients with alcoholic liver disease and primary biliary cirrhosis after transplantation Our studies were extended to the human liver of patients with alcoholic liver disease and other liver diseases, as well as of control subjects who had suffered an accidental death. Samples of human liver were obtained (after the organ was recovered and frozen at −80°C) from various patient groups at the time of liver transplant. Samples were collected from control patients at the time of autopsy after accidental death. In these fatty acid analyses, portions (∼1 g) of liver tissue were thawed, weighed, homogenized, and extracted by using the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959). They were subsequently transmethylated with BF3-methanol, and gas-chromatographic analysis was performed as previously described (Salem et al., 1996). Although, the data were not corrected for possible differences in the water content of the tissue, the EFA concentration of livers obtained from patients with alcoholic liver disease had significantly lower amounts of 18:2n6, 18:3n6, 20:3n6, 18:3n3, 22:5n3, and 22:6n3 relative to those for healthy subjects ( Table 2). There were also significant decrements in the nonessential fatty acids 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n9, as well as in the total fatty acid content of the liver samples. Although the total fatty acid content in the livers of patients with alcoholic liver disease was only about half that of control subjects, several PUFAs remained at the same concentration, including 20:4n6, 22:4n6, 22:5n6, and 20:5n3. Arachidonic acid (20:4n6) was the major highly unsaturated fatty acid in these liver specimens. The marked lower amounts in 22:6n3 and 22:5n3 concentrations, along with the constancy of 20:4n6, 22:4n6, and 22:5n6, indicates a selective loss of the highly unsaturated n-3 fatty acids. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis exhibited no loss in either 20:4n6 or 22:6n3. Of the EFAs, only 18:2n6, 18:3n6, and 18:3n3 had significant decrements relative to findings for healthy subjects (Table 2). As in the patients with alcoholic liver disease, there was a significantly lower concentration of 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n9 relative to findings for healthy subjects. The absence of an effect on docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3) in the patients with primary biliary cirrhosis would indicate that this loss was not related to the rather complex medical course and diets of these patients before transplantation and, again, would support the idea of a specificity for the loss of docosahexaenoic acid in alcoholic liver disease."

4,Desaturase enzymes and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis,"2.1 Desaturase enzymes and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis The desaturases are a group of microsomal membrane-bound enzymes that dehydrogenate fatty acids at specific sites along the carbon chain. Dehydrogenation yields a polyenoic fatty acid with an additional double bond in the cis configuration. The nomenclature used to differentiate the desaturases (Δ-9, Δ-6, and Δ-5) refers to the location of the double bond, with numbering beginning from the carboxyl end. For example, Δ-6 desaturase generates 18:3n6 from 18:2n6 by removing two hydrogen atoms from the methylene carbons at positions 12 and 13. Likewise, Δ-5 desaturase produces 20:4n6 from 20:3n6. The three desaturases are linked to a cytochrome system (b5 and b5 reductase), which facilitates the transfer of electrons from the desaturase to molecular oxygen, forming H2O. The nonessential fatty acids and the n-6 and n-3 fatty acid precursors have different binding affinities to the desaturase complex, and a fatty acid from one family (e.g., 18:3n3) can competitively displace a fatty acid belonging to a different family (e.g., 18:2n6) at the binding site. Thus, one factor that is involved in determining the tissue concentration of long-chain PUFAs is the availability of n-6 and n-3 fatty acid substrates, which is, in turn, controlled in large part by the composition of dietary fats."
5,Effect of ethanol on delta-6 and delta-5 desaturase activities,"2.2 Effect of ethanol on delta-6 and delta-5 desaturase activities It has long been suggested that an ethanol-induced decrease in the concentration of 20:4n6 in the liver without a decrease in 18:2n6 may result from an inhibition of either Δ-6 or Δ-5 desaturase (and perhaps both). In early in vitro experiments, Nervi et al. (1980) and Wang and Reitz (1983), using liver microsomes obtained from rats fed ethanol (36% energy), observed that the activities of both Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturases were reduced compared with findings in control subjects. Nakamura et al. (1994) also showed that both Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturase activities were lower in vitro (2.5- and 1.8-fold lower for Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturases, respectively) in micropigs that had consumed a high-fat (34% energy) and high-ethanol (40% energy) diet for 12 months. However, Venkatesan et al. (1990) found no change in Δ-6 desaturase activity, but did find a decrease in Δ-5 and Δ-9 desaturase activities in the livers of rats fed a high dose of ethanol (34% energy) and either a high-fat (18% energy) or low-fat (4.4% energy) diet. Results from these investigations supported the notion that when animals were maintained on diets in which a very high percentage of calories was derived from ethanol, the function of the Δ-5 desaturase system (enzyme and/or cytochrome complex) and, in some cases, the Δ-6 desaturase activity may be reduced. However, a caveat must be added that in vitro measurements generally provide somewhat artificial conditions, may reflect the enzymatic capacity to perform desaturase reactions, and may not always reflect the regulatory systems that determine actual enzymatic activity of a pathway in vivo. In an effort to determine the direct effect of alcohol on fatty acid desaturation, Narce et al. (2001) studied desaturase activity in rat hepatocytes obtained from animals that had been maintained on a diet in which 18% of the energy content was derived from fat. Cells were incubated in a medium that contained a broad range of ethanol concentrations (25–800 mM), and desaturation was determined by using labeled substrates. They observed that at concentrations below 400 mM, ethanol stimulated both Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturase activities. For ethanol concentrations between 25 and 200 mM, there was a 25% to 30% increase in Δ-5 desaturase activity and a 15% to 40% increase in Δ-6 activity compared with baseline values. When the concentration of ethanol was increased to 400 mM, a slight decrease in the activities of both enzymes was observed. At 800 mM ethanol, both Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturase activities decreased. It is clear from the descriptions of the above investigations that these studies were designed to address somewhat different questions relevant to the effect of ethanol on EFA desaturation. In vitro studies carried out by using tissues obtained from animals fed diets in which a high percentage of calories was derived from alcohol do not assess a direct effect of ethanol on desaturase function. However, results from these studies do demonstrate that capacity to desaturate fatty acids is altered after prolonged, continuous consumption of high doses of alcohol. Findings from cell culture assays are of interest in that a positive effect of ethanol on desaturase activity throughout a wide range of concentrations seems contradictory to the long-term consequences of alcohol consumption on tissue PUFA content. Investigations with the use of isotope tracer technology to assess in vivo EFA metabolism in animals consuming alcohol may provide additional evidence to reconcile these disparate findings."
6,In vivo studies on the effect of ethanol on essential fatty acid metabolism,"2.3 In vivo studies on the effect of ethanol on essential fatty acid metabolism Two stable isotope studies (Pawlosky & Salem, 1999; Pawlosky et al., 1998) were carried out in experimental animals to determine the effect of prolonged alcohol consumption on the in vivo metabolism of 18:2n6 and 18:3n3. In one study, control and alcohol-consuming rhesus monkeys were given a single oral dose of 100 mg of deuterium labeled–18:2n6 and –18:3n3, blood samples were obtained periodically for the measurements of the labeled and unlabeled (endogenous) fatty acids, and the area under the time course curves (AUC) of the fatty acids in plasma was determined (Pawlosky & Salem, 1999). There were no differences in the AUC values for either labeled-18:2n6 or labeled-18:3n3 between control animals and alcohol-consuming monkeys, indicating a similar overall absorption of the fatty acid precursors ( Table 3). The AUC values for plasma 20:4n6 and 22:6n3 tended to be greater in the alcohol-treated group than in the control animals, and this finding seems to indicate that the rate of synthesis and release of 20:4n6 and 22:6n3 may have been greater in the alcohol-treated group compared with findings for control animals. Findings of a somewhat similar study in felines (Pawlosky et al., 1998) seemed to indicate that ethanol consumption may have had a positive effect on the production of long-chain n-3 PUFAs in the liver on the basis of the AUC determinations of the enrichment of these fatty acids in the total lipid extracts of the liver ( Table 4). Evidence from these studies supports the idea that production of longchain n-3 and n-6 PUFAs is not inhibited when animals are consuming intoxicating quantities of alcohol over sustained periods as this would be expected to lead to a lower enrichment of deuterium into the longer chain metabolites."
7,Effect of ethanol on free radical formation and lipid peroxidation,"2.4 Effect of ethanol on free radical formation and lipid peroxidation The possibility that an alcohol-induced decrease of tissue PUFAs may be the result of either increased fatty acid utilization or catabolism (through lipid peroxidation) is supported by results of both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Findings from numerous studies in both experimental animals and human beings have shown that ethanol metabolism is capable of generating reactive oxygen species, which can react with PUFAs (Kamimura et al., 1992; Meagher et al., 1999; Moser et al., 1993; Nanji et al., 1994; Nordmann et al., 1992; Pawlosky et al., 1997; Rouach et al., 1997; Tuma et al., 1996). Of the several possible mechanisms underlying the prooxidant effect of ethanol, formation of hydroxyl radicals through the metabolism of ethanol by the P450 enzyme cytochrome P450 2E1 has drawn considerable interest (Nanji et al., 1994; Nordmann et al., 1992; Rouach et al., 1997). Reaction of hydroxyl radicals (HO.) with hydrogen atoms on methylene carbons of PUFAs results in the production of resonance-stabilized allylic carbon radicals. Reaction of the carbon radical with molecular oxygen yields a lipid hydroperoxide radical (ROO.). After abstraction of a hydrogen atom from water or other substrate, the lipid hydroperoxide (ROOH) may undergo homolytic cleavage to form both an alkoxyl radical (RO.) and HO.. These radicals may, in turn, react with the hydrogen atoms on other methylene carbons of PUFAs, regenerating carbon radicals in a self-perpetuating cascade. The more double bonds a fatty acid has, the greater the probability that some of these methylene hydrogen atoms will undergo reaction with an HO. and form an allylic carbon radical. Thus, more highly unsaturated fatty acids, such as 20:4n6 and 22:6n3, are more likely to be catabolized through lipid peroxidation, and this is one mechanism by which ethanol metabolism could alter the ratio of long-chain PUFAs to 18-carbon PUFAs (i.e., decrease 20:4n6/18:2n6). A series of subsequent biochemical and chemical transformations eventually leads to the conversion of lipid hydroperoxides to isoprostanes and aldehydes. Several specific oxygenated compounds have served as markers of alcohol-mediated oxidation, such as malonylaldehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE), and the isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2α). 8-iso-PGF2α is the oxidation product of arachidonic acid and is an isomer of prostaglandin F2α. Malonylaldehyde can be produced from both monounsaturated fatty acids and PUFAs, whereas 4-HNE is derived specifically from n-6 fatty acids and 4-HHE is produced only from n-3 fatty acids by means of free radical mechanism. The aldehydes (malonylaldehyde, 4-HNE, and 4-HHE as well as others), which have been found to be excreted in urine (Meagher et al., 1999; Moser et al., 1993), are highly reactive compounds, and they may bind irreversibly to nitrogen moieties of proteins (Rouach et al., 1997; Tuma et al., 1996) or DNA nucleotides, altering their conformation and disrupting subsequent metabolic processes. It is interesting to speculate that alcohol-induced decreases in Δ-5 or Δ-6 desaturase activity may occur as a result of an aldehyde modification made to the protein– or enzyme–cytochrome complex. Evidence from studies in rhesus monkeys has shown that high concentrations of both 4-HNE and 8-iso-PGF2α were found in the plasma of ethanol-consuming animals compared with findings for their dietary control animals (Pawlosky et al., 1997). Also, in human beings, high concentrations of isoprostanes and 4-HNE were present in the urine of healthy subjects after they had consumed quantities of strong alcoholic beverages (Meagher et al., 1999). Moreover, compared with findings for healthy individuals, both 8-iso-PGF2α and 4-HNE concentrations were elevated in the urine of patients diagnosed with acute alcoholic hepatitis (Meagher et al., 1999). It is thus evident that alcohol exposure results in an increased rate of fatty acid catabolism. This increased catabolism may provide the signal for subsequent alterations in the anabolic pathways for EFAs, as well as underpin the change in PUFA tissue concentration when the alcohol challenge is of a sufficient intensity."
8,A hypothesis to rationalize the effect of ethanol on polyunsaturated fatty acid liver composition,"Of the many interrelated factors that have an influence on an ethanol-induced alteration of liver PUFA concentration, the fatty acid composition of the diet, the amount and duration of alcohol consumption, and the balance of effects on the anabolic and catabolic processes of EFA metabolism are of chief importance. For instance, it was shown that a polyunsaturated phospholipid was effective in preventing ethanol-induced liver injury in baboons (Lieber et al., 1994, 1997). The amounts of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in the diet strongly influence the liver fatty acyl composition. Animal study designs in which the EFA content of the diet is in limited supply can more precisely reveal the effects of ethanol on altering the PUFA composition of tissue. In this experimental design, the EFA input is maintained at a subsistence level for the species, so that ethanol-induced utilization of PUFA would not be obscured by excessive amounts of dietary EFA (Pawlosky & Salem, 1995; Pawlosky et al., 1997). Conversely, study designs in which animals are fed diets containing exceedingly high amounts of long-chain PUFAs as a percentage of energy may be of interest for the pharmacologic properties of the diet (e.g., as a source of lipid peroxides) (Nanji et al., 1994). In Western society, the intake of n-3 fatty acids is generally low (Raper et al., 1992), and the diets of alcoholics may be poorer still in this respect. For example, a group of middle-aged Scottish men with a mean alcohol intake of 66 g per day had a significantly lower dietary intake of protein, fat, linoleic acid, and total polyunsaturated fat (Thomson et al., 1988). Thus, a low n-3 intake may provide a relevant model for potentiating the organ-damaging effects of ethanol. Conversely, a higher intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, such as 20:5n3 and 22:6n3, may be protective against organ-damaging effects of alcohol. Evidence obtained from the fatty acyl composition of liver obtained from human beings indicates that fatty acid desaturation was not affected in patients with alcoholic liver disease because the concentrations of some long-chain polyunsaturates, such as 20:4n6, 22:4n6, and 22:5n6, all products of Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturation, were not altered. The lower concentrations of long-chain n-3 fatty acids observed in patients with alcoholic liver disease are consistent with evidence from alcohol studies in micropigs (Villanueva et al., 1994), felines (Pawlosky & Salem, 1995), and rhesus monkeys (Pawlosky et al., 1997). The much lower concentrations of 22:6n3 in the livers of patients with alcoholic liver disease may be the result of a lower dietary supply of n-3 fatty acids and possible greater susceptibility of long-chain n-3 PUFAs to lipid oxidation. In hepatocyte cell culture, both Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase activities were stimulated by exposure to a broad range of physiologic doses of ethanol. Further, it seems that in vivo desaturation was stimulated in both felines and rhesus monkeys that regularly consumed intoxicating quantities of alcohol. However, continuous consumption of much higher quantities of alcohol was shown to have a negative impact on Δ-5 desaturase (with variable effects on Δ-6 desaturase). Thus, at very high ethanol concentrations, change in desaturase activity may be brought about through an alteration of the enzyme or cytochrome system complex, perhaps by an aldehyde adduct. It is also interesting to note that there are reports of both stimulation (Nakamura et al., 1992) and inhibition (Venkatesan et al., 1990) of Δ-9 desaturase after chronic (12 months and 5 weeks, respectively) alcohol consumption. An alcohol-induced utilization or catabolism of tissue PUFAs may increase desaturase activity because of up-regulation to compensate for the tissue loss of PUFAs ( Fig. 1). Fatty acid anabolic metabolism may subsequently respond to a signal associated with this increased fatty acid degradation. This signal may be related to the decreased tissue concentration of PUFAs or the increased concentrations of fatty acid catabolic products. However, the tissue concentration of PUFAs that result from the balance of anabolic and catabolic processes will be determined by the intensity of the alcohol challenge. At low doses of alcohol and for short-term exposure, PUFA concentrations may actually increase owing to the stimulation of fatty acid anabolism (Denkins et al., 2000). At high alcohol doses for prolonged periods, fatty acid catabolism will overwhelm adaptive responses to increase fatty acid elongation/desaturation, and tissue concentrations of PUFAs will decline. The presence of higher concentrations of fatty acids like 22:6n3 in the diet is hypothesized to protect, at least partially, from the alcohol-induced loss of liver and brain docosahexaenoic acid. In this way, the diet may be a factor that leads to either the promotion of or the protection from organ disease related to alcohol abuse."
