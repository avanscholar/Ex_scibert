0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a versatile fuel and a strategic clean energy carrier. Hydrogen has the highest energy content (120MJ/Kg) compared to conventional fuels [1]. The major obstacle in utilization of hydrogen energy is that it's unavailable in molecular form in nature and has to be produced from main sources, namely biomass, water and hydrocarbons like natural gas, naphtha and coal [2,3]. Among these sources, hydrogen production from biomass is recently considered as a potential alternative to meet the energy demand of near future. It has a near zero emission cycle, because carbon dioxide released from the process will be theoretically captured during photosynthesis of plants [4,5]. Independency on finishing fossils, renewable, widespread and inexpensive feedstock and being environmentally benign are other advantages of this route. Political, economic and environmental impacts of biomass-based hydrogen are attractively discussed by Mustafa Balat and Mehmet Balat [6]. Hydrothermal gasification of wet biomass wastes and industrial effluents is a promising solution among various conversion technologies. The term “hydrothermal” refers to water at elevated temperature and pressure, around its critical point (T c =374.1°C, P c =22.1MPa), and covers two regions of sub- and supercritical water [7]. Sub- and supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is a novel process to transform biomass into hydrogen and methane-rich gas, with reduced tar and char formation [8], efficiently for biomass with high moisture content [9]. Applications of SCWG lie in two broad areas, including gas product utilization and aqueous effluent management. Various downstream processes are introduced for SCWG that depend on separation technologies and process intention. Gas product mainly contains H2, CH4, CO2, and CO; with varying contributions depending on feed and operating conditions. High pressure hydrogen and syngas (H2 +CO) are transmissible to petrochemical complexes with no need to further compression. Hydrogen could be also utilized in mobile and stationary fuel cells after depressurization. A novel process design is proposed by Fiori et al. [10]. Moreover, methane produced in SCWG is an alternative to substitute for in-plant usage of natural gas. Finally, compressed CO2 obtained in process may be applicable for underground storage, deep-sea sequestration and reuse in chemical processes. Useful reviews on hydrothermal biomass gasification and its prospects are proponed by Kruse [11] and Matsumura et al. [12]. On the other hand, SCWG has the advantage of using wastewater streams as feed and delivering treated effluent with efficiently reduced TOC and COD levels. Depending on feed characteristics and operating conditions, aqueous effluent may be admissible to be discharged according to environmental regulations or could be recycled after removing the minerals in desalination unit. Hydrothermal process has been widely investigated as a novel alternative to conventional wastewater treatment routines [13]. Considerable progressive efforts have been made during past two decades to assess the reliability and feasibility of SCWG of various biomass types at different operating conditions. Choosing DWW as a proper feed to SCWG is of great interest, due to its high COD level, high organic solid matters and large volumes produced annually [14]. Since this study has exploited subcritical water to gasify DWW without catalyst, literature review focuses on non-catalytic, subcritical water and industrial waste stream studies. There are several reports for hydrothermal gasification of industrial effluents, such as polyvinyl alcohol-contaminated wastewater [15], polyethylene glycol-contaminated wastewater [16], tannery waste [17], ethanol production waste [18] olive mill [9,19], domestic [8], and oily [19] wastewaters. A summary of previous studies and comparison to this work is presented in Table 1 . Several studies have been recently performed concerning non-catalytic hydrogen production from crude glycerol [21], sewage sludge [22] and willow [23] in hot compressed water; and from long-chain alkanes [24], carboxylic acids alcohols [25] and pulp/paper-mill sludge [26] in SCW. Extensive investigations have been also conducted in subcritical water conditions. Gasification of cellulose as a model compound at low temperatures (200–350°C) was reported in a series of articles by Minowa et al. [27–29]. They carried out the experiments with and without presence of reduced nickel as catalyst. Azadi et al. conducted near-critical water gasification of glucose using metal [30] and homogeneous organometallic catalysts [31]. More recently, Muangrat et al. examined gasification of food waste components [17], model food waste [32] and food models [33] at 330°C and 13.5MPa, using NaOH, H2O2 and nickel catalysts. They also discussed about reaction products in liquid phase and proposed a comprehensive decomposition pathway. In this work, we investigated subcritical water gasification of beet-based DWW in batch reactor system with residence times between 15 and 45min and temperatures and pressures ranging from 300 to 375°C and from 89 to 210bar, respectively. In addition, influence of biomass loading in reaction mixture was studied with 20, 30 and 40 wt% solutions. Although a comprehensive reaction mechanism has not been determined for hydrothermal gasification of biomass to date, many researchers have adopted reforming, water-gas shift (WGS) and methanation as three main pathways, presented by Eqs. (1)–(3), respectively [3,34,35]. In parallel with CO methanation (Eq. (3)), some researchers have also considered CO2 methanation (Eq. (4)) as well [19].

1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Distillery wastewater (DWW) feedstock used in this work was obtained from a local beet-based ethanol manufacturer and used as received. The wastewater was diluted as needed with deionized water in order to prepare 20, 30 and 40wt% solutions for experiments. Elemental analysis (dry base) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were carried out in an external laboratory. The empirical chemical formula of the DWW was found to be C0.2511 H0.4265 O0.2925 N0.0298. Detailed characteristics of the received wastewater are listed in Table 2 ."
3,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Experimental apparatus and procedure Subcritical water gasification of DWW experiments were carried out in a stainless steel 316L batch autoclave, with a volume of 160mL (including its tubing). The reactor assembly included a K-type thermocouple inserted in a thermowell and the reaction temperature was maintained with a PID controller. Pressure was monitored directly by means of a pressure gauge and a pressure transducer fitted to the top of the reactor. For safety considerations, a pressure safety valve (VEE-LOK 6000 psi) with the set point of 280bar was mounted on the reactor. The whole experimental assembly, except the control box, was also placed inside a safeguard with two-layer polycarbonate shields. Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic of experimental setup utilized in this study. In a typical run, the reactor was loaded with 90mL of prepared solution of wastewater/water and closed tightly. Spiral-wound gaskets were used to fully seal the autoclave flange. The air in the reactor was firstly purged by pressurizing and depressurizing of the reactor with pure nitrogen of 4bar for five times. Then it was heated by an electrical furnace (1000W) to the desired reaction temperature. After a given reaction time, the furnace was removed and the reactor was exposed to ambient air to cool down to 200°C by natural convection and subsequently to 30°C by fan. Forced convection was not applied from the beginning of cooling period to prevent reducing the reactor life time. This procedure was kept identical for all runs. The behavior of temperature and pressure inside the reactor during heating and cooling periods are demonstrated in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. Gaseous product was collected in a gas bag for further analysis and then the reactor was opened for volumetric measurement of the remaining liquid phase."
4,Analyses,"2.3 Analyses The gaseous product from each run was immediately discharged to an initially evacuated sampling bag (Tedlar-SKC) and then sampled by using a gas-tight syringe for gas analysis injection. Gas analysis was carried out with a gas chromatograph (Young Lin Acme 6100 GC) equipped with two Agilent 19,095Q-P04 packed columns in series with a 5Å Agilent molecular sieve column and a helium ion detector (HID) to determine H2, CH4, CO, CO2, N2 and O2 concentrations. Pure helium (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate and the pressure were 28mL/min and 6.4 psig, respectively. The oven and the HID detector temperatures were maintained at 35°C and 280°C, respectively. The required time to perform the GC program was 20min. A standard gas mixture was used to calibrate the GC analyses before each run. All gas products were analyzed twice and the average values were recorded. However, the difference between two replicates was below 8%. As the nitrogen in gas product was originated from air purging before heating, N2 was omitted from produced gas calculation and other mole fractions were normalized."
5,Data interpretation,"2.4 Data interpretation Data obtained from the gas chromatography, CHNSO-TGA analyses and logging of operating parameters were used to calculate the gasification efficiency (GE), carbon gasification efficiency (CGE), hydrogen selectivity (HS) and gas product (GP) in order to characterize the hydrothermal gasification of DWW. The mean values of at least two replicates are reported in this manuscript, while the relative difference between iterations was limited to 10%. Gasification efficiency (GE) is defined as: (4) G E = gr of produced gas gr of dry matter in feed × 100 Carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) is defined as: (5) C G E = gr of carbon in produced gas gr of carbon in dry matter in feed × 100 Hydrogen selectivity (HS) is defined as: (6) HS = moles of H 2 in produced gas sum of moles of other gaseous products Gas product (GP) is defined as: (7) GP = P × V R × T The amount of gas product was calculated using temperature, pressure and head-space volume of the reactor after cooling to room conditions, according to ideal gas rule. The head-space volume was considered as the difference between the total inner reactor chamber and the effluent liquid volumes."
6,Results and discussion,"In this work, subcritical water gasification of DWW is studied in a batch reactor with residence times between 15 and 45min and temperatures and pressures ranging from 300 to 375°C and from 89 to 210bar, respectively. Moreover, effect of biomass loading in reaction mixture was explored with 20, 30 and 40wt% solutions. The summary of experimental conditions and results of this work is presented in Table 3 . In this section, the effects of variations in each parameter on composition of gaseous product, GE, CGE, HS and GP are comparatively discussed."
7,Effect of temperature,"3.1 Effect of temperature Series of experiments were carried out to determine the effect of temperature on the gaseous product obtained from subcritical water gasification of DWW. The gaseous product mainly contained H2 and CO2 with less amounts of CH4 and CO. Gas product, GE and CGE obtained at various temperatures are depicted in Fig. 4 . The significance of temperature on gasification is evident. As it can be seen, gasification efficiency has a general tendency to increase by temperature increment at a given reaction time. Moreover, gas formation was facilitated at higher temperature, as the gas product enhanced from 5.08 to 13.07 mmol, by temperature increment from 300 to 375°C. This behavior was widely noted by previous reports and could be attributed to several facts. First, higher temperature is generally favorable to higher reaction rate and also free-radical reactions, as the dominating pathway for gas production near critical point of water [38]. Moreover, water undergoes considerable changes in properties near and above its critical point, making it a unique reaction media as well as both reactant and solvent for gases and organic matters. H3O+ and OH− ions are formed due to the self-dissociation of water, behaving as catalytic precursors for acidic or basic reactions and reacting with smaller intermediate products [19,39]. Higher temperature is also in favor of progressing the reforming of biomass as an endothermic reaction (Eq. (1)). Increasing heat capacity, diffusivity and transport properties of water as the results of temperature increment could be other reasons for delectability of hydrothermal water as reaction media. Fig. 5 shows the composition of gaseous product and hydrogen selectivity over temperature, carried out with 30wt% solution for 45min. Increasing the temperature from 300 to 350°C favored H2 mole fraction from 4.7 to 14.6%. Further increase of temperature to 375°C significantly improved the hydrogen portion up to 48.81%. This trend was accompanied by continuous reduction of CO2 and slight increase in CO mole fraction. However, CO seems to be greatly consumed at 375°C, while CH4 production was found to be scarce unless reaching near critical point. Carbon monoxide can be consumed through both WGS and methanation reactions. Susanti et al. [40] suggested that extremely low CO fraction could be attributed to significant enhancement of WGS reaction. This is consistent with the results of Pedro D’ Jesus et al. [41] who interestingly found that increasing temperature promotes CO conversion by the WGS reaction, although it is exothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium leads to CO formation at higher temperatures. Moreover, considering the increase in CH4 content implies that methanation reactions had also contribution in CO consumption. Zhiyong and Xiuyi [20] also showed that methanation reaction becomes dominant beyond the critical point. Low concentration of methane in dry gas product was also observed in hydrothermal gasification of ethanol production waste [18] and crude glycerol [21]. Fig. 5 also shows that temperature increase from 350 to 375°C resulted in sharp rise of hydrogen selectivity by more than five folds (from 0.17 to 0.95). During thermal decomposition, large molecules of wastewater are dissolved and hydrolyzed into smaller intermediates and gasified into final products, mainly due to the cleavage of C-O bonds and reacting with OH− and H+ ions. This mechanism favors the formation of H2 through reforming and WGS reactions which are accelerated at higher temperatures. These findings are in good accordance with previous reports [2,19,42]. Similar behaviors were observed at other reaction time spans (Table 3). Generally, CO2 was the most abundant component in gas product at all runs except Test #18, where the highest temperature and reaction time of this study was considered with middle point concentration. In that case, H2 could surprisingly outrun CO2 by 48.8% contribution in mole fraction. Progression of gasification efficiency at elevated temperature was also observed at shorter reaction times."
8,Effect of reaction time,"3.2 Effect of reaction time Subcritical water gasification of DWW was performed in 15, 30 and 45min time spans, to verify the effect of reaction time on process target. Fig. 6 illustrates GE, CGE and GP as functions of reaction time at 375°C with 30wt% concentration. As expected, longer residence time facilitated the formation of gaseous product, such that by prolonging the reaction time from 15 to 45min, GE and CGE slightly increased from 15.5 to 17.4% and from 12.2 to 13.6%, respectively. Similar trends were observed by Dianningrum et al. [21], who studied gasification of glycerol in hot compressed water with residence time ranging 15–120min. According to Table 3, the rates of improvement in GE and CGE over time were higher at low temperatures compared to near critical point. This suggests that effectiveness of the reaction time declines gradually by increasing the temperature. Another salience of Fig. 6 is that by increasing holding time from 15 to 45min, GP showed a slight increasing trend, from 10.98 to 13.07 mmol, offering reaction time has positive but less influence on gasification, compared to temperature (Fig. 4). This is consistent to previous reports [22,43,44]. Effect of reaction time on gas composition should be discussed in various temperatures, since these two parameters have competitive influence on progression of Reactions (1)–(4). Prolonging the reaction time at 300°C resulted in slight reduction of hydrogen mole fraction in gas product. This is likely due to the fact that hydrogen is consumed through methanation reactions (Eqs. (3) and (4)) to produce methane, as both of these reactions are exothermic and favored by low temperatures, compared to reforming reaction that is progressed at higher temperatures. Steady increase of methane by reaction time admits this explanation, while similar trends were also reported previously [30,43]. In the middle-range temperatures, HS showed a swing behavior by changing reaction time. Some fluctuations were observed that may be contributed to the simultaneous effect of time and temperature on gas and liquid phase reactions. High temperature facilitates conversion of biomass and water molecules in liquid medium and become gasify into H2 and CO. Once CO is introduced to gas phase, it could react with water vapor through WGS reaction to produce more hydrogen. On the other hand, longer reaction time provides more opportunity for methanation reactions to consume H2 and produce CH4. There is also competition between increasing reaction rate by higher temperature and backward progression of exothermic ones, which may complicate the interactions. However, variations of HS and gas composition were gradual and less sensitive to time, compared to temperature. The dependence of gas composition and HS on reaction time at the highest temperature is demonstrated in Fig. 7 . It was interestingly found that prolonging reaction time is favorable to hydrogen fraction in gaseous product. H2 mole fraction increased from 45.36% to 48.81% by increasing the reaction time from 15 to 45min, meaning that HS rose from 0.83 to 0.95. Instead, slight decrease in CO2 and CO fractions was observed. In this case, backward promotion of methanation reactions is clearly concluded, since hydrogen could be generated by 3 or 4 folds compared to CO and CO2, according to stoichiometric ratios."
9,Effect of biomass loading,"3.3 Effect of biomass loading In this study, the original DWW was diluted as needed by deionized water to 20, 30 and 40 wt% solutions, in order to investigate the effect of biomass loading on gasification characteristics. The results are displayed in Figs. 8 and 9 , corresponding to experiments at 375°C and 30min. Fig. 8 clearly highlights that GP experienced a considerable increase as the result of biomass loading increment, literally from 8.51 to 14.99 mmol, whereas both GE and CGE faced reducing trends. This situation suggests that increase in biomass concentration of feed has two counteractive effects: (1) increasing the amount of gaseous product due to presence of more reactants in reaction media, and (2) decreasing the process efficiency, which points to lower heat transfer and less uniform mass distribution. It is well known that biomass concentration is an important economic parameter. Increasing feedstock concentration leads to further conversion of liquid intermediates into char and tarry products, therewith reactor plugging and catalyst deactivation, and also suppresses the gasification efficiency [16,21]. On the other hand, decreasing concentration necessitates greater energy to heat and pump aqueous solution through system, but offers higher hydrogen and methane yields [45,46]. Thus, a comprehensive appraisement would be required according to the process intention and constraints. As demonstrated in Fig. 9, variation in biomass loading had no considerable influence on gas composition, and consequently on HS. However, a gradual enhancement in H2 and CH4 mole fractions was observed. Increase in CH4 and decline in CO2 production as the results of increasing concentration is due to the fact that WGS reaction is promoted at lower water/carbon ratio [35,46]. A comparison of H2 production trends at various temperatures is displayed in Fig. 10 , to show that hydrogen selectivity of the gas product is slightly supported by biomass loading increment. As mentioned before, the preference for methanation reaction under high concentration condition is evident, which consumes H2 molecules to form CH4. Nevertheless, H2 mole fraction remained at the same level (45.81–47.81% at 375°C). This observation suggests that reforming of biomass in hydrothermal water (Eq. (1)) possesses a positive reaction order."
10,Hydrogen production,"3.4 Hydrogen production As the hydrogen production was of primary interest in this study, the absolute amounts of hydrogen generated in hydrothermal experiments are presented in this section. Figs. 11 and 12 comparatively illustrate the effects of temperature, reaction time and biomass loading on total hydrogen. It was observed that increase of biomass loading could much effectively enhance the hydrogen production, compared to increasing the reaction time. For instance, 40 wt% solution with 30min reaction time (Test #10,14,20) generated more hydrogen than experiments with 30 wt% in even 45min (Test #8,13,18). Moreover, at 375°C, reduction of biomass loading from 30 to 20 wt% resulted in lower hydrogen which could not be compensated by increasing reaction time from 15 to 30min. These findings clearly suggest that hydrogen production is much sensitive to biomass loading compared to reaction time. Hydrogen production exhibited strong temperature dependence and a sharp rise was observed by reaching the critical point at all conditions. This may be attributed to the fact that decomposition of large molecules into water soluble intermediates and finally into gasifiable products is generally an endothermic route, containing many bond-breaking and dehydration reactions, which are all enhanced by thermal energy. A simplified reaction mechanism for hydrothermal conversion of biomass is developed based on the results and reaction schemes given in previous reports [25,33,47–50] and is shown in Fig. 13 . This figure represents the main conversion pathways, but not all individual reactions. Some other side reactions are also possible in hydrothermal environment, depending on the nature of biomass and its constituents."
11,Conclusions,"Hydrothermal gasification of biomass remarkably favors sustainable social development, since it could produce bio-energy from renewable sources and treat industrial wastes, simultaneously. In this work, subcritical water gasification of a beet-based DWW was studied in a batch reactor with residence times ranging 15–45min and temperatures and pressures ranging from 300 to 375°C and from 89 to 210bar, respectively. Also, influence of biomass loading in reaction mixture was examined with 20, 30 and 40wt% solutions. It was observed that temperature and biomass loading are the most effective parameters, while reaction time has less important role. Gasification efficiency (GE) was greatly facilitated by increasing temperature. Moreover, hydrogen selectivity (HS) significantly increased as the temperature reached the critical point. The results showed that both GE and HS increased slightly by prolonging the residence time, but effectiveness of the time was less at higher temperatures. It was also observed that as the feedstock concentration increased, so did the gaseous product (GP), but GE was reduced. However, variation in biomass loading had no considerable effect on gas composition. Since hydrogen production was the main interest of the current study, the most favorable operating condition was determined as 375°C for 45min with 40 wt% feed concentration. Finally, the total amount of hydrogen showed much sensitivity to biomass loading compared to reaction time, and exhibited strong temperature dependence with a sharp rise by reaching the critical point at all conditions."
