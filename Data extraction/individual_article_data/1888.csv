0,Introduction,"The human population is increasing at a tremendous rate and already crossed around 7.2 billion marks and is supposed to increase between 9.6 and 12.3 billion by 2100 (Gerland et al., 2014). The growth of the human population is accompanied by massive industrialization and energy consumption owing to stress on natural resources to an unexpected level (Awasthi et al., 2020; Bhatia et al., 2021a). The global energy consumption will increase by 1.2% every year and is supposed to reach 18.9 billion TOE (tons of oil equivalent) by 2040 (Koyama, 2017). According to a report, the major exporters of oil (middle eastern countries) will not be capable to fulfill the energy demand by the next 50 years (Bhatia et al., 2021b). Overexploitation of fossil-based energy resources also posed a serious threat to the environment and society (Yadav et al., 2021). Fossil fuels burning produce greenhouse gases (CO2, SO2, and NOx) and various toxic pollutants (mercury, volatile chemicals, and polycyclic hydrocarbons) responsible for global warming and have an adverse effect on humans health (Perera, 2017). To meet all these issues, the use of renewable energy is considered a sustainable option to full fill the energy demand in addition to existing non-renewable energy sources (Bhatia et al., 2021c; Rajesh Banu et al., 2021). Different types of renewable energy sources such as wind, hydro, geothermal, solar energy, biodiesel, biogas have been explored to provide energy (Bhatia et al., 2021d). Most of these energy production technologies are well developed but still, there are many challenges such as high production cost, availability of raw material, etc. Many materials have been reported with a variety of application as an electrode (silver, titanium, platinum) in a microbial fuel cell (MFC), catalysts for biodiesel (metals oxides), catalysts for biohydrogen (platinum, ruthenium, nickel, etc.), (Vasić et al., 2020; Velasco et al., 2021; Yaqoob et al., 2020a). Preferably, the materials used for renewable energy production at a large scale should be inexpensive, produced from abundantly available natural materials; as the development of efficient and cost-effective materials is a prerequisite necessity of time. Biomass is the most abundantly available renewable resource on earth and its estimated global production is around 2 × 1011 tons (dry carbon bases) in 2016 (Liu et al., 2019). Biomass has been explored for the synthesis of various materials (biochar and graphene etc.) having application in energy production (Sekar et al., 2021). Biochar is a carbon-rich material that can be produced by the thermochemical decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass, animal wastes, municipal wastes, and other organic materials (Gurav et al., 2021b; Leininger & Ren, 2021). Biochar is composed of various amounts of trace metal ions, having a porous structure with high surface area, different functional groups, biocompatible, and easy to modify. Different processes such as pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) have been reported for biochar production. Properties of biochar depend on feedstock, technology, and operating conditions used as discussed in detail elsewhere (Yaashikaa et al., 2020). Biochar is easy to produce from renewable raw materials and has applications in different areas such as energy, bioremediation, agriculture, and pharmaceutical, etc. (Lu et al., 2020; Raj et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021a). When biochar is applied to agricultural land it helps to improve agriculture sustainability and yield by increasing the water and nutrient holding capacity of the soil (Zhou et al., 2021b). Many researchers have demonstrated the use of a variety of biochar in the removal of various pollutants such as cyanotoxins, azo dye, and antibiotics, etc. (Gurav et al., 2021a; Kim et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021). In the energy sector, various application of biochar has been reported such as synthesis of electrode (anodic/cathodic) material in microbial fuel cells, catalyst in methane reforming, supporting material for microbial biofilm and enhanced electron transfer in the anaerobic digestion process (Ding et al., 2020; Doddapaneni et al., 2018; Harun et al., 2020). From all current research and developments and the applicability of biochar in renewable energy production, it can be predicted as future material with tremendous potential. There are very few systematic and critical reviews on this issue while it is an extremely hot topic of the 21st century. This review article is focused on biochar production technologies and their application in renewable energy production."
1,Biochar (BC) production,"Biochar can be produced from different biomass such as agriculture waste, sewage sludge waste, animal waste, algal waste, etc. Many methods have been reported to produce biochar from biomass like pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal carbonization, etc."
2,Pyrolysis,"2.1 Pyrolysis Pyrolysis is the process where biomass is thermally decomposed in the absence of oxygen. This process is mainly composed of two decomposition stages i.e., primary, and secondary. During the primary stage dehydration, dehydrogenation, and decarboxylation process occurs (Patel et al., 2020b). After completion of the primary reaction, secondary reaction start which involves cracking of large molecules and transformation of solids into biochar and gases. Mainly pyrolysis process is of two types i.e., slow pyrolysis and fast pyrolysis based on operating conditions. Slow pyrolysis involves heating at a lower rate (0.1 to 1 °C s−1) for a long time (hours to days) at a temperature (300–900 °C). The slow pyrolysis process provides a favorable environment for secondary processes and resulted in increased biochar production. In fast pyrolysis, biomass is heated at a higher temperature (300–1000 °C) and at a high heating rate (10–1000 °C s−1) for short time (0.5–2 s) (Alvarez et al., 2015). The main products produced during the pyrolysis process include solid (biochar), liquid (bio-oil), and gas (syngas) (Te et al., 2021). Biochar is a solid carbonaceous material that can be used as a catalyst, adsorbent, and fuel. The syngas is composed of CH4, CO2, H2, CO, and other low molecular gases that can be used in gas engines after processing. The bio-oil is consists of water, alcohol, phenolics compound, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon, and nitrogenous compounds (pyrazine, pyridine, and amines, etc.) which can be used in boilers to generate heat (Patel et al., 2020b). Pyrolysis temperature influences properties of biochar such as surface area, functional groups, and porosity. With the increase of temperature surface area and porosity increase due to breakage of aliphatic alkyl and esters group present in organic compounds which leads to removal of pore-blocking substances (Chi et al., 2021). Biochar produced at a lower temperature is hydrophilic and simulates graphene structure with less functional groups at its surface. While biochar produced at higher temperatures are hydrophobic and functional groups are reshuffled and new groups such as carboxyl, lactone, phenol, pyridine, etc. are introduced and these groups can act as electron donors and acceptors (Chi et al., 2021). Akinfalabi et al., prepared biochar from sugarcane bagasse biomass using pyrolysis at 400 °C (2 h) and further sulphonated with ClSO3H. Sulphanation process leads to an increase in surface area from 98 to 298 m2 g−1 and its utilization as a catalyst for biodiesel production resulted in 98.6% fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) yield (Akinfalabi et al., 2020). Types of biomass feedstock affect the yield and quality of biochar. Pyrolysis of forestry plants results in 30% biochar compared to biochar produced from lignin 45.69%, this indicates that biochar yield depends on lignin content (Toloue Farrokh et al., 2018). Zhang et al. reported that lotus stem pyrolyzed at 800 °C presents a 55% higher surface area (1610 m2 g−1) as compared to porous carbon from leaves due to the presence of higher content of metal ions in the stem."
3,Gasification,"2.2 Gasification Gasification is the process of biomass decomposition into gaseous fuel (H2, CO, CH4, etc.) at higher temperatures (500–1400 °C) in the oxygen-deficient condition. The gaseous product production can be enhanced by passing various gasification agents such as steam, CO2, and a certain mixture of gases. >50% of biomass transformed into gaseous fuel and biochar produced by this process is smaller in size, resistant against the chemical oxidation process (Yaashikaa et al., 2020). Temperature is a significant factor in the gasification process and results in increased carbon monoxide and hydrogen production while a decrease in carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrocarbon at higher temperatures (Prabakar et al., 2018). The surface area of biochar produced by the gasification process is generally smaller and has fewer functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups than the biochar produced by the pyrolysis process (Peterson & Jackson, 2014). The quality and yield of biochar are also affected by the equivalence ratio (ER). The higher ER represents that more oxygen is fed into the gasifier and it may have a positive or negative effect on biochar properties. In a study biochar yield and carbon content decreased from 0.22 to 0.14 kg g−1 biomass and 88.17% to 71.6%, respectively, with the increase of ER from 0.1 to 0.6 (Yao et al., 2018). The high presence of oxygen molecules results in increased content of ash with reduced mechanical strength and yield of biochar. In another study, James et al., studied the effect of airflow on Pine woodchip biochar’s properties and reported airflow of 8 to 20 L min−1 produce basic biochar (pH > 7.0) and no acidic functional groups present at a high airflow rate (James et al., 2020). Biochar produced by the gasification process has a high content of alkali and alkaline earth metals which mainly depends on the type of biomass (Ahmad et al., 2021). Different types of gasifiers such as fixed bed, fluidized bed, and circulating fluidized reactors have been developed and discussed in detail elsewhere (Sansaniwal et al., 2017)."
4,Hydrothermal technology,"2.3 Hydrothermal technology This process involves the thermochemical conversion of wet biomass into hydrochar. Hydrochar is like biochar obtained using the different processes as discussed above. The process is similar to the natural coal formation process. Hydrothermal treatment is performed at moderate temperature (150–350 °C) under 10–15 bar (Chi et al., 2021). At higher temperatures and pressure, water undergoes dramatic properties change acting more like an organic solvent and favors reactions that are generally catalyzed by acid and bases and promote biomass decomposition (Maniscalco et al., 2020). Although the exact mechanism for the hydrothermal treatment is not understood it is expected that it involves hydrolysis, dehydration, decarboxylation, aromatization, and recondensation. During the hydrolysis process biomass breakdown into saccharides and lignin, and in the dehydration process water is removed from biomass by eliminating the hydroxyl group. CO2 is removed during the decarboxylation process which leads to aromatization. Various compounds which are produced during all these processes i.e., furfural undergoes hydrolysis and break down into phenols, aldehydes, and acids. All these compounds undergo recondensation with aromatic polymers and results in hydrochar (Abbas et al., 2021). The main advantage of the hydrothermal process is its ability to convert wet biomass into carbonaceous solids with a high yield without the requirement of energy extensive drying process. Other advantages include conductive behavior, adjustable surface functionalities, the existence of natural binder and high calorific value, etc. (Sharma et al., 2020). At higher temperature (~350 °C) this process shows a decrease in the yield of hydrochar (29%) and bio-oil (31%), and a significant increase in gases fraction (67%) (Ahmed et al., 2021). An increase in temperature also causes a decrease in O/C and H/C ratio. Wang et al. produced hydrochar from sunflower stalk using hydrothermal carbonization combining activation method and the produced hydrochar has a high surface area of 1505 m2 g−1 and an energy density of 35.7 Wh kg−1 (Wang et al., 2018). Hydrochar can also be easily fabricated using various physical and chemical methods. The use of KOH as a chemical activating agent yields biochar with a higher surface area as compared to other chemicals like ZnCl2, HCl, NaCl, and MgCO3 as KOH can come in contact with the outer surface layer of carbon material easily (Oumabady et al., 2021)."
5,Application of biochar in renewable energy,Biomass-derived biochar has different applications in renewable energy production. It can be used as an electrode in MFC and as a catalyst for biodiesel and hydrogen production.
6,Biomaterials in MFC for bioelectricity production,"3.1 Biomaterials in MFC for bioelectricity production Energy scarcity and environmental pollution are the major concern throughout the world. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) can be a possible approach to solve these problems simultaneously. MFC is a device composed of anodic and cathodic chambers separated by a proton exchange membrane and uses microbes as a catalyst to convert chemical energy into electrical energy (Fig. 1 a). Microorganisms metabolize organic material for growth, reproduction and produce various intermediates which undergo oxidation and reduction and produce electrons and protons (Do et al., 2021). Under anaerobic conditions electrons produced in the anodic chamber pass to the electrode through a membrane-associated electron transporter, electron mediator, or nanowires (Lee et al., 2018). From an anodic electrode electron pass to the cathode by an external circuit, simultaneously proton moves to the cathode through proton exchange membrane (Gebreslassie et al., 2021). The reduction process occurs in a cathodic chamber among electron, proton, and electron acceptor, and a continuous current is produced. Various microbes have been reported for MFC related applications such as Arenibacter palladensis, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, Clostridium butyricum, and Rhodospirillum rubrum, etc. (Cao et al., 2019; Gurav et al., 2019; Jeon et al., 2018). Electricity production depends on various factors such as substrate type, rate of electron transfer from microbe to the electrode, performance of electrode, circuit resistance, proton transfer rate, oxygen reduction rate, and external operating conditions (Huggins et al., 2014). Different types of electrode materials have been investigated and their performance depends on their physical and chemical properties which affect microbial attachment, electrode resistance, and electron transfer rate, etc. (Zhou et al., 2011). Despite advancements in MFC technology, lower current output and higher cost remain the main bottleneck in the applicability of this technology at a higher scale. Many studies report 20–50% of MFC running cost is due to electrode material as these are non-renewable (Huggins et al., 2014). A wide variety of materials have been explored for electrode preparation such as gold, stainless steel, nickel, titanium, copper, etc. Most of these materials require additional surface modification to support microbial biofilm production and electron transfer. Global demand for these metals also increasing as they act as a catalyst, used in electronics and other industrial application and making them extremely costly (Slate et al., 2019). Recently carbon-based materials such as graphene and carbon nanotube are getting attention due to their biocompatibility for microbial growth and biofilm support, high conductivity, high surface area, and low-cost properties (Yaqoob et al., 2020b). The use of these new materials is also not feasible as production of these materials requires expensive and sophisticated instruments and chemicals. Alternatively, biochar a carbon material derived from biomass is considered a renewable material for electrode production (Chakraborty et al., 2020b). It is generally produced from locally available raw material (agriculture and forestry residue, sludge, and crops waste, etc.) and results in cost reduction associated with feedstock purchasing, transportation, and storage (Hemalatha et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2019). Biochar based electrodes are inexpensive as compared to other commercial electrodes. Cao et al., prepared N/Fe co-doped carbon (N/Fe-C) electrode by direct carbonization of waste adsorbent and reported that N/Fe-C material cost was around 0.03–0.08 $ g−1 according to the cost of raw material and energy consumption which was a thousand times lower than commercial Pt electrode (Cao et al., 2016). 3.1.1 Synthesis of anodic electrode A variety of biomass has been reported for anode preparation and properties of an electrode depend on various factors such as pore size, accessible surface area, and surface properties (Table. 1 ). Hemalatha et al. pyrolyzed deoiled Azolla pinnata biomass (600 °C) to prepare anode and evaluated it in MFC, and the experiment resulted in 382 mV with 65.6% COD reduction (Hemalatha et al., 2020). Carbon material (biochar) used for electrode preparation can be produced by the pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal treatment of biomass (Gabhane et al., 2020). The carbon in biomass is incorporated by CO2 capture during the photosynthesis while other heteroatoms (N, P, S) come from enzymes involved in photosynthesis. During the pyrolysis, process water evaporates leaving behind a porous carbon structure and the heteroatoms serve as a natural dopant and provide excellent electrical conductivity. Zhang et al. performed pyrolysis of bread and produced a three-dimensional N, P, and S co-doped (NPS-CFs) carbon foam. The produced material NPS-CFs had a high surface area (295.07 m2 g−1) and a high load of N, P, and S (Zhang et al., 2018) (Fig. 1a). Huggins et al., prepared biochar from wood biomass of forestry residue and milling residue by pyrolysis process at 1000 °C for 1 h. Biochar produced from forestry residue and milling residue has pore sizes of 37.6 and 29.4 Å with surface area 428.6 and 469.9 cm2 g−1 and their use as electrode able to produce power 457 and 532 mW m−2, respectively. Produced electrode cost was 90% less than commercial granular activated carbon and graphite granule (Huggins et al., 2014). Along with electricity production, MFC can also be used for wastewater treatment and has the advantage of low sludge production as compared to the conventional anaerobic digestion process. Huggins et al. prepared anode and cathode electrodes from food waste-derived biochar and evaluated these in MFC for wastewater treatment. The constructed MFC showed chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction by 95% with ammonia and phosphorus removal by 73 and 88%, respectively, and able to produce power up to 6 W m−3 (Huggins et al., 2016). Electricity production in MFC is affected by electrode properties and bacteria interaction (Yang & Chen, 2020; Zhang et al., 2011). The interaction between bacteria and electrodes is reflected by the biofilm formation. Biofilm formation involves various steps including attachment of bacteria to the electrode, formation of single and multiple layers, formation of polymeric scaffold and finally maturing of biofilm 3D structure. Attachment of bacteria depends on electrode properties such as hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, functional groups, and surface microtexture (Santoro et al., 2015). Initially, MFC shows low electrocatalytic activity and current production but as the biofilm matures its shows an increase in its efficiency (Silva et al., 2020). Mature biofilm shows improved mass transfer which is directly related to the electron transport between biofilm and electrode and determines the current response of the anode (Greenman et al., 2019). External resistance act as an inducible factor for the regulation and formation of biofilm (Koók et al., 2020). Zhang et al. studied the effect of different external resistance on biofilm production and reported low resistance (10 and 50 Ω) resulted in better biofilm with high current output due to extensive voids within the biofilm which helps in the mass transfer of substrate and buffer and removal of products (Zhang et al., 2011). The pore size of the anode is also important to ensure effective biofilm formation. The size of microbes is generally in the range of 1 to 2 µm and many researchers have reported that pore of 2–10 µm or appropriate for colonization of bacterial cells. Karthikeyan et al., prepared carbon electrodes derived from king mushroom (CEKM), wild mushroom (CEWM), and corn stem (CECS) and studied pore size and biofilm formation. FESEM analysis shows that CEKM, CEWM, CECS exhibited pore sizes of 10–120 µm, 75–200 µm, and 2–7 µm, respectively (Karthikeyan et al., 2015). It was concluded that pores of approximately 10 µm are required to penetrate the microbes easily and to produce biofilm of 10–100 µm, but still, this pore size is insufficient for proper biofilm formation. After clogging of pores by biofilm the supply of nutrients and removal of metabolites from interiors of electrode impeded which inhibits biofilm growth and cause the death of microbes in a pore. While anode of pore size 75–200 µm allows sufficient colonization on anode without any clogging problem (Yang & Chen, 2020). 3.1.2 Synthesis of cathodic electrode Generally, platinum and its alloy are used to prepare cathode electrodes, but their high cost hinders their use in MFC. Like an anode electrode, plant biomass-derived biochar can also be used to prepare cathodic electrodes (Table. 1). Air cathode is consists of a catalyst layer (CL), a gas diffusion layer (GDL), and support. Catalyst layer facilitates oxygen and ions diffusion and hydrophobic GDL prevents leakage of electrolyte and support have a role in electron conduction (Yang & Chen, 2020). The CL is prepared by coating a layer of a mixture of catalyst and binder onto the other side of the carbon cloth. Various chemicals such as Nafion, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are used as a binder to facilitate oxygen transfer. Bose et al., prepared a cathode using sugarcane refuse activated carbon mixed with PVDF binder and spread directly on stainless steel mesh, and its use in MFC working on wastewater treatment results in 0.40 mA m−2 current density and 110 mW m−2 power density (Bose et al., 2019). Oxygen reduction rate depends on the properties of the cathode, Watson et al., studied different activated carbon derived from various biomass (coal, peat, coconut shell, hardwood, and phenolic resin) in MFC and reported that hardwood derived materials have the highest number of acidic functional groups showed poor MFC performance (630 mW m−2) (Watson et al., 2013). They concluded that surface area alone is a poor predictor of cathode performance and the presence of high acidic functional groups determines the oxygen reduction potential of cathode."
7,Biochar in biodiesel production,"3.2 Biochar in biodiesel production Biodiesel is considered a favorable source of energy for existing engines as it has high energy densities due to the presence of C14-C20 long carbon chain fatty acids (Bhatia et al., 2017). Biodiesel is produced by the transesterification of the oils obtained from various resources (plant oils, algal oil, or waste animal fats, etc.) (Fig. 1b). Catalysts play an essential role in the transesterification of oils with alcohols and are categorized as homogenous and heterogeneous. Biochar is a type of heterogeneous catalyst and has been reported to catalyze transesterification and esterification reactions (Table. 2 ) (Foroutan et al., 2021). Waste cooking oil (WCO) contains free fatty acids (FFA) which affects transesterification reaction as the use of alkali catalysts results in soap formation and acid-catalyzed reactions are slow (Bhatia et al., 2020a). Heterogeneous catalysts can carry transesterification as well as an esterification reaction. Water produced during the esterification reaction of FFA and dehydration of alcohol reacts with triacylglycerol (TG) and produces an excess of FFA by hydrolysis of TG (Lin & Ma, 2020). Most of the research was performed by using acid or alkali-modified biochar. The porous structure of biochar allow easy access of reactant to active sites to facilitate transesterification and the hydrophobic surface of biochar helps in removal of water the undesired product produced during the catalytic activity (Bhatia et al., 2021a). Acid-treated biochar is generally produced by sulfonation process with H2SO4 or -SO3 vapors which add -SO3H group on biochar surface and acts as a catalyst. Basic biochar has basic sites which are oxides of Ca, K, or Na. These sites are generated in the biochar during the calcination of minerals in biomass or introduced into the catalyst surface with the impregnation of a precursor with Ca, Na, or K (Vakros, 2018). During the heating, process reactants exist in different phases i.e., alcohols (gaseous) and lipids (liquids), and the use of porous structure expedites the collision frequency of reactants at ambient pressure. The reactant of two-phase colloids each other in numerous pores and creates a similar effect as catalysts by lowering the activation energy of transesterification (Lee et al., 2017). Dehkhoda & Ellis reported biodiesel production by simultaneous transesterification and esterification of canola oil and oleic acids using sulfonated biochar and reported 48% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield (Dehkhoda & Ellis, 2013). Jung et al. prepared maize residue biochar and performed transesterification of coconut oil at 380 °C and reported 87% fatty acids ethyl ester (FAEE) yield (Jung et al., 2017). Lee et al., studied different biochar (maize residue, Japanese wood, rice husk, pine cone, mixed wood, and bamboo) for pseudo-catalytic transesterifications of WCO and reported a maximum FAME yield 90% with maize biochar and concluded that lignin content affects the process while holo cellulose does not have any effect (Lee et al., 2017). Mustapha et al., performed techno-economic analysis for conversion of Scenedesmus sp. lipids into biodiesel using lipid extracted algae derived biochar as catalyst and reported that use of these catalyst reduced the unit production cost of microalgal biodiesel from 2.03 $ kg−1 to 1.70–1.74 $ kg−1 when compared to homogenous catalysts (Mustapha et al., 2021)."
8,Biochar as a catalyst in biohydrogen production,"3.3 Biochar as a catalyst in biohydrogen production The use of biochar has been also reported for biohydrogen production using the methane steam reforming, water splitting, and anaerobic digestion process as discussed in the following sections. 3.3.1 Biochar as catalysts for water splitting to produce hydrogen Hydrogen production using the water-splitting method is the cleanest approach however the efficiency of the process is low due to the high overpotential of hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode (Yang et al., 2021). Various electrocatalysts of noble metals and their oxides (RuO2 and IrO2) have been reported for hydrogen production but their high cost and instability in an alkaline medium restrict their applications. Carbon-based materials are getting more intentions as electrocatalysts due to their low cost and good electrical conductivity. To decrease the overpotential and increase hydrogen production carbon materials are doped with transition metals compounds as this helps to create more active sites for electron transfer quickly. Biomass contains different amounts of alkali and alkali earth metals which helps in the activation of carbon and porous structure formation via the ionic migration effect at higher temperatures (Zhang et al., 2017). Yang et al. prepared biochar from watermelon peel and further cobalt nanoparticles were grown on it to obtain CCW-x nanocomposites. CCW-x was used as an electrocatalyst and its HER was higher as compared to well-studied Pt/C (Yang et al., 2021). Catalysts able to perform in the acidic environment are of specific interest as these are congruent with the existing proton exchange membrane and show a lower ohmic loss (Carmo et al., 2013). Hydrogen production from water under acidic conditions requires precious metal-based electrocatalysts such as Pt, Ru. To overcome this issue use of various transition metal phosphides, nitrides, and carbides have been reported. Recently biochar derived molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) is receiving attention due to its Pt-like stability and structure. The HER efficiency of Mo2C electrocatalysts is still low due to the lack of exposed catalytic sites and strong Mo-H bonding. The use of a porous architecture with a large surface area can provide abundant catalytic sites (Guo et al., 2020). Guo et al., prepared a three-dimensional porous Mo2C/C nanostructure derived from N, K coactivated biochar (NKAB) and Mo2C/NKAB electrocatalyst exhibits higher HER with a smaller overpotential of (161 and 144 mV) to achieve 10 mA cm−2 and small tafel slope of 57 and 53 m dec-1 (Guo et al., 2020). Humagain et. al., prepared porous Mo2C by magnesiothermic reduction reactions using biomass of birch forestry residue. The Mo2C catalysts require an overpotential of 35–60 mV to drive current density of −10 and −100 mA cm−2 in 0.50 M H2SO4 and exhibit stable operation for > 100 h (Humagain et al., 2018). 3.3.2 Biochar as a catalyst for methane steam reforming to produce hydrogen Methane is the main component of natural gas and can also be produced by the anaerobic digestion of various organic waste. Methane contains the highest hydrogen carbon ratio (4:1) and its steam reforming results in higher hydrogen with low COx production (Harun et al., 2020). Thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane is getting attraction to produce pure hydrogen. The non-catalytic TCD process requires a higher temperature (~1200 °C) for reaction initiation and high HER. To increase methane conversion at lower temperature use of various metallic catalysts (nickel, copper, and iron, etc.) have been reported. The TCD process requires a catalyst, and various metal catalysts have been reported but these catalysts lose activity very fast. Another challenge is the presence of sulfur content in natural gas and it is poisonous to catalysts. The carbonaceous material has higher stability and is resistant to sulfur content. Carbon material loaded with a small amount of metals shows a higher activity as these create high energy active sites in amorphous carbon and attract methane molecules which leads to increased conversion (Fig. 2 a). Harun et al., used Ru doped activated biochar (Ru-AB) as catalysts for TCD of methane and reported 51% methane conversion at 800 °C after 60 h of reaction time (Harun et al., 2020). Activated carbon-supported Ni catalysts of different compositions (Ni10, Ni20, Ni30, and Ni40) were used for TCD of methane by Prasad et al., and Ni30 catalyst results in 1.62 L h−1 H2 (Prasad et al., 2010). Patel et al., prepared biochar from biosolid recovered wastewater treatment plants and use it for the TCD process of methane, and reported 65.2% conversion (Patel et al., 2020a). 3.3.3 Biochar in anaerobic digestion to produce H2 Most of the biowastes are managed using the anaerobic digestion (AD) process and leads to the production of bioenergy. Many researchers have reported that the addition of biochar during the AD process increases hydrogen yield in the short lag phase (Table. 3 ). The exact mechanism of biochar that promotes H2 production is still not understood and it is reported that biochar facilitates biofilm formation, stabilizes the pH, and increases volatile fatty acids (VFA) production (Sugiarto et al., 2021) (Fig. 2b). Minerals present in biochar provide nutrients to microbes and support growth. These minerals are also involved in enzyme synthesis and activity. Sunyoto et al., added pine dust derived biochar in two-phase anaerobic digestion of aqueous carbohydrates and the results showed that biochar addition resulted in improved hydrogen yield (31.0%) and methane yield (10.0%) with shortened lag phase in two phases 36.0% and 41.0%, respectively (Sunyoto et al., 2016). Zhao et al., used calcium lignosulphonate-derived biochar to improve hydrogen production and reported 50.9% increase as compared to the control (Zhao et al., 2019). In another study, a co-culture of Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli was explored for hydrogen production using municipal solid waste with the addition of biochar, and reported 96.63 mL H2 g−1 in shortened lag phase (12.5 h to 8.1 h) (Sharma & Melkania, 2017). Li et al. studied the effect of rice straw biochar on fermentation and reported a 118.5% and 79.6% increase in H2 production in ethanol and butyrate-based fermentation (Li et al., 2020). Biochar buffered the pH, lowered the redox potential, and porosity of biochar bossed cell immobilization which resulted in increased hydrogen production. There are various inhibitors such as ammonia, heavy metals, phenols, and biomass-derived inhibitors (furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and vanillin), etc. are present in the waste biomass hydrolysate and affects microbial growth. The small size of various inhibitors allows them to penetrate cell membranes and damage the internal structure of the cells, change the morphology of cells, inhibit RNA and protein synthesis (Jönsson & Martín, 2016). Weak acids have been also reported to act as inhibitors for glycolytic enzymes and ATP regeneration systems which results in energy drain and ultimately leads to reduced microbial growth (Bhatia et al., 2020b). Microbes may acclimatize to various inhibitors but it’s a time-consuming process and affect productivity. The addition of biochar helps in the removal of inhibitors and reduces their toxic effect. Lin et al., studied the effect of furfural on E. aerogenes dark fermentation of glucose and observed that lower concentration of furfural (5 mM) resulted in increased production of H2 (163.5 mL g−1 to 193.7 mL g−1), while higher concentration (30 mM) significantly decreased H2 production (163.5 mL g−1 to 109.1 mL g−1) (Lin et al., 2020). Doddapaneni et al., used torrefied biomass for furfural removal from torrefaction condensate and reported 60% furfural removal. Adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and AD of detoxified torrefaction condensate shows that lag phase in methane production reduced from 25 d to 15 d (Doddapaneni et al., 2018). These studies show that biochar can be used to remove various inhibitors from hydrolysate and improve AD process for H2 production. There are no studies reported where biochar detoxified biomass is further used for hydrogen production."
9,Future perspective of biomass-derived biochar in energy production,"Traditionally biochar is used for soil amendment (oxygen and moisture content maintenance, nutrient release, microbes enrichment, etc.), and bioremediation purposes (dye removal, antibiotics removal, etc.), and there are many research reports and review articles are available on these issues. In this review article advances in different technologies reported for biochar synthesis and recent applications of biochar in renewable energy production are reviewed. Application of biochar depends on its properties and to produce biochar with desired properties is a challenge as it directly depends on the biomass composition, technologies, and conditions used for biomass conversion into biochar. It requires better understandings of the physicochemical properties of biochar properties to utilize it for diverse applications, for example, pH buffering capacity is important for bioprocessing where microbes produce acids. The presence of various trace elements in biochar may supplements nutrients to microbes and replace the requirement of additional mineral addition during the fermentation. Biochar used in MFC provides support to microbe’s growth and biofilm production. Biochar properties such as high surface area, porosity, functional groups, provide a suitable environment for microbial biofilm productions required for electricity production in MFC. Biochar is also widely reported for biodiesel production and getting more attention due to its heterogeneous nature, various methods are used to activate the biochar and there is a need to investigate new activation methods to make biochar catalysts more efficient and reusable. To utilize biochar for renewable energy production there is a need for knowledge and understanding based on experimental characterization and set a process that can help to select biomass and operating conditions to produce biochar of desired properties. Biomass properties largely affect the properties of produced biochar and there is a need to work on the strategy to minimize the natural effect on biochar. Artificial intelligence based on the relation between biomass composition, biochar properties, structure, and functional groups may help in the screening process of material for various applications. The advances in various technologies related to biochar production, and characterization have opened new avenues in other areas such as renewable energy (microbial fuel cell, catalyst in transesterification and hydrogen productions), carbon dioxide sequestration, water, and air purification, cosmetics, etc. Most studies suggest that the utilization of biochar improves the efficiency and productivity of various processes. Globally there are different success stories related to biochar production and utilization but still, there are many of its applications are yet to be realized. There is a need to make biochar production technology more economic and efficient."
10,Conclusion,"Renewable energy has the potential to support the existing energy resource to fulfill the future energy demand. To make renewable energy more affordable there is a need to make this technology economic and efficient. Biochar has been explored for the synthesis of electrode materials, catalysts to catalyze reactions involved in biodiesel and biohydrogen production. To make the biochar mediated process more efficient there is a need to works on the synthesis of biochar with desired properties. Recent advances related to biochar-based material research in renewable energy suggest its potential to be a source of future energy."
