0,Introduction,"In recent decades, photocatalytic water splitting into H2 and O2 using solar energy and semiconductors has attracted increasing attention because of its potential application in clean fuel (H2) production, which would solve the problem of environmental pollution and energy shortage [1–4]. Since 1972, TiO2 was firstly used as photocatalyst by Fujishima and Honda to split water into H2 and O2, many other types of photocatalysts have been reported during the last four decades [5–15]. However, most of the photocatalysts are facing with the issue of photoelectron–hole pair separation that is a key factor for efficiency improvement of photocatalytic water splitting. As well known, the recombination and separation/migration processes are two important competitive processes for photoelectron–hole pair generated inside a photocatalyst during the photocatalytic water splitting process [16]. Till now, loading noble metals onto different photocatalysts to act as cocatalysts has been demonstrated to be a good approach for the separation of photoelectron–hole pair because the loaded noble metals can act as charge transfer sites and/or active sites in the photocatalytic reaction [17,18]. A lot of photocatalysts such as ZnmIn2S3+m (m = 1∼5, integer) [19], Cr2O3/CdS [20], β-In2S3 [21], ZnGa2O4 [22] showed interesting photocatalytic activity after loaded with noble metal cocatalysts (Pt, Rh, Pd). Besides noble metals, some metal oxides and metal sulfides, such as CdS, RuO2, NiOx, have been used as cocatalysts to improve the photocatalytic activity of water splitting [23–27]. And the photocatalytic activities of the catalysts loaded with metal oxides are generally lower than those loaded with noble metals. Recently, modification of crystal structure and morphology of photocatalysts as another efficient method has been reported to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of water splitting, where good crystallinity and fewer crystal defects can significantly enhance the electron transport properties [16,28–30]. However, the reported photocatalysts can exhibit good photocatalytic efficiency only when they are assisted by cocatalysts. Up to now, few photocatalysts have been reported to possess good photocatalytic activity without the help of cocatalysts. In addition, metal or nonmetal ions doped into photocatalysts are generally used as a way to change the energy gaps of semiconductors (photocatalysts) and make them respond to visible light [31–34]. But the effect of the metal or nonmetal ions doped into photocatalysts on the improvement of the photocatalyic activity of H2 evolution from water has been scantily investigated up to now [16,30,35–38]. In the present work, we selected SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 substitutionally doped with Zn(II) ions at A-sites (Sr or Ba) for the first time, and then successfully prepared two new catalysts, Sr2/3Zn1/3TiO3 (1) and Ba5/6Zn1/6TiO3 (2), with perovskite structures by sol–gel method. Noteworthily, compared with the pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, 1 and 2 without cocatalysts loading showed a dramatic improvement in photocatalytic activity for reduction of water to H2 with a small quantity of ethanol (∼3%) as a sacrificial electron reagent. Furthermore, interestingly, 1 and 2 still showed good production efficiencies of H2 from pure water without any cocatalysts loading. This work demonstrated that the doping of Zn(II) ions was an effective means to improve photocatalytic efficiency of H2 production for the titanates catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and measurement,"2.1 Materials and measurement All chemicals were analytically pure and used without further purification. The crystalline phases of 1 and 2 were identified by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 ADVANCE) using graphite monochromatized Cu-Ka (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The XRD data for indexing and cell-parameter calculation were collected in a scan mode with a scanning speed of 2°/min in the 2θ range between 20° and 70°. The morphology of 1 and 2 was observed with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Composition analyses on several randomly selected samples of 1 and 2 were performed on a field-emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS). The exact compositions of 1 and 2 were both obtained from the average values of the several randomly selected samples with many times. The chemical compositions of 1 and 2 were also determined by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES; Vista-MPX, VARIAN). UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured with a PE Lambda 900 UV/Vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. Photoluminescence analyses were performed on an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer. Raman measurements were performed using a JY LabRam HR800 spectrometer equipped with a microscope. Laser radiation (λ = 514.5 nm) was used as excitation source at 5 mW. Conduction band value of Zn-doped BaTiO3 with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential was measured on an Electrochemical Station CHI660C in a standard three-electrode system."
3,Syntheses,"2.2 Syntheses Compound 1 was prepared by the sol–gel method. Stoichiometric strontium nitrate (4.233 g, 0.02 mol) zinc nitrate (4.463 g, 0.015 mol) and citric acid (12.6084 g, 0.06 mol) was dissolved in the 50 mL pure water under stirring, kept 50 °C for half an hour, added among the tetrabutyl titanate (10.25 mL, 0.03 mol) of glycol solution (10 mL), and then kept the solution at 80 °C under stirring until the sol were formed. Finally, the sol was dried at 100 °C and then calcinated at 900 °C for 5 h in air. A crop of faint yellow powder of 1 was obtained (Fig. S1 in Supporting Information). Compound 2 was prepared by polymer complexing sol–gel method. Firstly, the tetrabutyl titanate (10.25 mL, 0.03 mol) was dissolved in 10 mL isopropyl alcohol, stirred for 0.5 h, then adding 3 mL glacial acetic acid into the above solution to form a kind of mixed solution. Secondly, stoichiometric amounts of barium acetate (6.385 g, 0.025 mol) and zinc acetate (1.098 g, 0.005 mol) was dissolved in 10 mL of 36% acetic acid, added to the previously prepared mixed solution, stirred for 1 h, and then kept the solution at 95 °C in water bath for 1 h. Finally, the sol was dried at 100 °C and then calcinated at 900 °C for 5 h in air. A crop of faint yellow powder of 2 was obtained (Fig. S1 in Supporting Information). The as-prepared powder of 1 and 2 were purified in a 36% acetic acid solution for 1 d, then filtered and soaked in pure water until pH value of the solution is about 7, and finally cleaned by pure water and air-dried at room temperature."
4,Photocatalytic reactions,"2.3 Photocatalytic reactions Photochemical reaction was carried out in a Pyrex reactor with a capacity of 500 mL, attached to an inner radiation-type 400 W high-pressure mercury and xenon lamp. For photocatalytic H2 evolution, the catalyst (0.1 g) was dispersed and suspended by a magnetic stirrer in pure water (160 ml) or an aqueous ethanol solution (5 ml CH3CH2OH and 155 ml H2O) in an outer irradiation Pyrex glass cell, which was connected to the closed gas circulation system. Before reaction, the closed gas circulation system and the reaction cell containing the respective aqueous solution were well evacuated. With increase of irradiation time, the gases evolved photocatalytically were circulated by a glass piston pump. The gases evolved were in situ analyzed with a TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8AIT, argon carrier), which was connected to the gas circulating line."
5,Computational details,"2.4 Computational details Calculation of the electronic band structures along with density of states (DOS) was carried out with density functional theory (DFT) using one of the three nonlocal gradient corrected exchange-correlation functionals (GGA-PBE) and performed with the CASTEP code [39], which uses a plane wave basis set for the valence electrons and norm-conserving pseudopotential for the core electrons [40]. The number of plane waves included in the basis was determined by a cutoff energy E c of 750 eV. Pseudoatomic calculations were performed for Sr-5s2, Ba-6s2, O-2s22p4, Ti-3d24 s2, and Zn-3d104s2. The structural and electronic structures of the SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 perfect crystals with the space group Pm-3m were studied as the basis for the investigation of substitutional doping metal-elements in these materials. The k-point meshes of the Brillouin zone sampling for the primitive cells of them were both set at 6 × 6 × 6 based on the Monkhorst–Pack scheme [41,42]. To get into a detailed insight, Zn-doped SrTiO3 or BaTiO3 at A sites (at Sr in SrTiO3 and at Ba in BaTiO3, respectively) was examined. Interstitial impurities are excluded here because the close-packed perovskite type structure makes the formation unlikely. For the simulation of the metal impurities in the different concentrations, we used 3 × 1 × 1, 6 × 1 × 1 and 10 × 1 × 1 supercells, respectively. As a result, formed were the following modeled structures: Sr1−x Zn x TiO3 and Ba1−x Zn x TiO3 (x = 1/3, 1/6, 1/10), and the Brillouin zones were sampled using 6 × 6 × 4 and 6 × 6 × 2 meshes, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Materials characterization,"3.1 Materials characterization The compositions of 1 and 2 analyzed by both EDS and ICP-AES were basically consistent with the nominal compositions. Hereafter, the Zn-doped SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 samples are named by their nominal compositions – Sr2/3Zn1/3TiO3 and Ba5/6Zn1/6TiO3, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) of the acid-treated powder of 1 and 2. Referring to the JCPDS Database data (JCPDS No. 01-074-1296, SrTiO3 with the space group Pm-3m and JCPDS No. 01-089-2475, BaTiO3 with the space group Pm-3m), all of the discernible diffraction peaks in 1 and 2 can be indexed. Little amount of impurity phase of Zn2TiO4 was observed in 1 but 2 is very pure. The diffraction peaks for 1 and 2 are very similar to the XRD patterns of pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, respectively, except the small shift of some diffraction peaks positions (especially the peak of (1 1 0)) to higher 2θ values for both 1 and 2 (Fig. S2). These indicate that compounds 1 and 2 have the same crystal structure as that of SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, respectively, and the Zn(II) ions are substitutionally doped at A-sites in the SrTiO3 or BaTiO3 host lattice. The ionic radius of Zn2+ (74 pm) is larger than that of Ti4+ (60.5 pm) but much smaller than those of Sr2+ (118 pm) and Ba2+ (135 pm). According to the Bragg formula, nλ = 2d sin θ (where d denotes the crystalline plane distance for indices (h k l), λ is the X-ray wave-length and θ is the diffraction angle), the d value will decrease when the Sr2+ or Ba2+ are substituted by Zn2+, which results in the shift of the diffraction peaks positions in 1 and 2 to higher θ values [43]. This indicates that the Zn ions partially substitute the Sr and Ba ions but not the Ti ions in 1 and 2, respectively. Noteworthly, unlike other cations doped at the B-sites in the perovskite-type oxides, compound 1 is a second example that the foreign ions are substituted at the A-sites of perovskite-type oxides (the first example is (Sr0.95Cr0.05)TiO3) [44] and compound 2 is the first case of the foreign transition ions substitutionally doped in BaTiO3 [44,45]. Furthermore, according to the tolerance factor t = ( r A + r O ) / 2 ( r B + r O ) (r A, r B and r O are the empirical ionic radii at room temperature) as defined by Goldshmidt for keeping the structure of a perovskite ABO3 [44,45], the t-values in SrTiO3, BaTiO3, Sr2/3Zn1/3TiO3 and Ba5/6Zn1/6TiO3 were calculated to be 0.910, 0.970, 0.858 and 0.934, respectively, all of which are the normally allowed t-values (0.75 < t < 1.0). The difference of tolerance factors between SrTiO3 and Sr2/3Zn1/3TiO3 is larger than that between BaTiO3 and Ba5/6Zn1/6TiO3, being consistent with the XRD results (Fig. S2). The same method was used in the analyses of the structure and composition of the compound (Sr0.95Cr0.05)TiO3 reported by Wang et al. [44] In addition, unlike the white color of pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 powder, the colors of 1 and 2 are both faint yellow. This indicates that the Zn ions are substitutionally doped into the host structures of SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 [46]. The morphology of the acid-treated powder of 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. It is clearly observed that compound 1 possesses well-crystallized bulk particles with the size of about 200 nm, whereas compound 2 forms well-crystallized spherical particles with the size of about 50 nm. There is some degree of aggregation and clumping in 2. The HRTEM images (Fig. 3) suggest that the submicrosized particles of 1 and 2 are both single-crystalline with no apparent defects and dislocations. The spacing distances of the observed lattice fringe have been deduced to be 0.278 and 0.285 nm for 1 and 2, respectively which is associated with the {110} plane of the cubic phase of 1 and 2. Compared with compound 2, the crystallinity of 1 is better, which results in better photocatalytic activity for 1 than 2. To study the optical absorption properties of the photocatalysts, the UV–vis reflectance spectra of the acid-treated powder of 1 and 2 were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 , compounds 1 and 2 both exhibit strong absorption in the edge of UV region, and the absorption edge of those are approximately at 395 nm, 385 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. S3, according to the Kubelka–Munk method [47], the band gaps of 1 and 2 were determined to be 3.15 and 3.20 eV, respectively. Compared with the pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, the absorption edge of 1 and 2 both red-shift markedly [44,48]. The photoluminescent properties of 1 and 2 were researched but the fluorescence properties of them were not observed in the wavelength range of 200–900 nm. As well known, the photoluminescence (PL) shows that the electrons in the valence band transferred to the conduction band and then the excited electrons were stabilized by photoemission. If the number of emitted electrons resulting from the recombination between excited electrons and holes is increased, the PL intensity increase and the photoactivity decrease [49]. Hence, there is a strong relationship between PL intensity and photoactivity. The poor photoluminescent properties of 1 and 2 indicate good photocatalytic activities of them. Raman spectral features are sensitive to the crystal structure of the metal oxides. Herein, we investigate the effect of the process of purifying with acetic acid on the crystal structures of 1 and 2. Nearly no changes in Raman spectra were observed before and after the acid treatment (Fig. S4), which show the process of acetic acid treatment will not affect the structures and the photocatalytic activities of 1 and 2 accordingly."
8,Photocatalytic results,"3.2 Photocatalytic results The photocatalysis experiments were carried out with the acid-treated 1 and 2 in powder form to provide sufficient surface area. They are both insoluble in water as well as in acid (HCl, pH = 0) or base (NaOH, pH = 14). As shown in Fig. 5 , the acid-treated powder of 1 and 2 both achieved H2 production from water with a small quantity of ethanol (∼3%) as a sacrificial reagent under ultraviolet light irradiation in the absence of noble metal cocatalysts, such as Pt, Pd and Ir. The mechanism of hydrogen production from an aqueous ethanol solution over photocatalysts can be written as, Photocatalyst + h v → Photocatalyst + h + + e − 2 h + + CH 3 CH 2 OH → CH 2 CH 2 O · + 2 H + 4 h + + CH 2 CH 2 O · + H 2 O → CO 2 ↑ + 4 H + 6 e − + 6 H + → 3 H 2 ↑ The overall reaction for hydrogen evolution is CH 3 CH 2 OH + H 2 O → photocatalyst + h v CO 2 ↑ + 3 H 2 ↑ As shown in Fig. 5, the rates of H2 production were about 73.2 μmol h−1 and 57.5 μmol h−1 for 1 and 2, respectively, and they remain constant during the reaction. After evacuating the reaction system and rerunning the experiment, an almost identical gas production rate was achieved (Fig. 6 ). This indicated that the H2 production resulted from a photocatalytic reforming of CH3OH by the photocatalysts rather than from the chemical reaction between water and photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. S5, the XRD patterns support this conclusion because the two photocatalysts remain unchanged before and after H2 production. In addition, it is noted that 1 and 2 still show good H2 production efficiencies from pure water without cocatalysts loading. As shown in Fig. 7 , the rates of H2 production were about 12.1 μmol h−1 and 2.9 μmol h−1 for 1 and 2, respectively, and they remain constant during the reaction. As a matter of fact, the rates of H2 production of the present materials is much lower than some photocatalysts loaded with cocatalysts, for example they are lower than photocatalysts of graphite oxide (about 2.5 mmol h−1 for H2 production) [10] and nanoparticle decorated graphene nanosheets (about 1.1 mmol h−1 for H2 production) [12]. But they are approximate to those of the photocatalysts without cocatalysts loading, such as the recent reported photocatalysts of BaZr1−x Sn x O3 (about 138 μmol h−1 for H2 production) [37], (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) (about 300 μmol h−1 for H2 production) [31] and Gd2Ti2O7/GdCrO3 (about 200 μmol h−1 for H2 production) [50]. So the present photocatalysts have potential application in hydrogen production. The mechanism of hydrogen production from pure water over photocatalysts can be written as, photocatalyst + h ν → photocatalyst + h + + e − h + + H 2 O → O · H + H + O 2 + 2 e − + 2 H + → H 2 O 2 O 2 + e − → O 2 − H 2 O 2 + O 2 − → O · H + OH − + O 2 ↑ h + + OH − → O · H 2 e − + 2 H + → H 2 ↑ The overall reaction for hydrogen evolution is 2 H 2 O → photocatalyst + h v O 2 ↑ + 2 H 2 ↑ To the best of our knowledge, the pure SrTiO3 without cocatalysts loading nearly can not split water into H2 and O2 reported in the literature because of SrTiO3 with high recombination rate between the photo-generated electrons and holes that results in the fast backward reaction between hydrogen and oxygen into water [51–55]. Furthermore, compared with SrTiO3 loaded with NiO x (70 μmol h−1), CoOx (23.2 μmol h−1), Os (55.4 μmol h−1), Pd (63.4 μmol h−1), Ir (71.4 μmol h−1) and so on [16,56,57], the H2 evolution rate of 1 without cocatalyst loading is larger. This could be explained that the capture of the photo-generated electrons by the doped Zn ions reduced the recombination of the photo-generated electrons and holes [31]. The specific reason of the drastic improvement of its photocatalytic activity was also investigated by theoretical method in the following section. It is well known that the match of the band gap and the potentials of the conduction and valence bands of photocatalysts are important for water splitting into H2. Both the reduction and oxidation potentials of water should lie within the band gap of the photocatalyst. The bottom level of the conduction band must be more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2, and the top level of the valence band must be more positive than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O [16]. As for the pure BaTiO3, the bottom of its conduction band is more positive than the reduction potential of H+/H2, which results in no H2 production with the pure BaTiO3 as photocatalyst [58]. However, when the partial Ba(II) ions were substitutionally doped by Zn(II) ions in the structure, the bottom of conduction band of Zn-doped BaTiO3 (Ba5/6Zn1/6TiO3) will move upward and become more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2, according to the CB values of −0.83 V (vs. NHE) by experimental method (Fig. S6). This is why water can be split into H2 with the catalyst of the Zn-doped BaTiO3. Although the as-synthesized Zn-doped SrTiO3 and Zn-doped BaTiO3 have good photocatalytic activities, the absorption edge of them were still about 390 nm, so it could not make good use of visible light for them. Thus, in order to obtain catalysts that are active under visible light, more nitrate zinc was added in the preparation process of the material in order to obtain catalysts containing more Zn(II) ions (namely more Sr(II)/Ba(II) ions are substituted by Zn(II) ions). However, pure phases of Zn-doped SrTiO3 or Zn-doped BaTiO3 can not be obtained but a mixture containing ZnO, Zn2TiO4 and SrTiO3 (or BaTiO3) was obtained. And the mixture has no H2 production activities from water under visible light or UV light. Now another new approach that Zn-doped SrTiO3 and Zn-doped BaTiO3 are loaded with some semiconductor (such as CdS and ZnSe) to form novel heterostructured semiconductor photocatalysts have being tried by our group."
9,Computational results,"3.3 Computational results 3.3.1 Pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 To investigate how the substitutional doping by Zn(II) ions affects the electronic band structure of SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, the band structures, total density of states (DOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 are calculated and plotted in Fig. 8 a and b and Fig. S7 and S8, respectively. The computed band gaps of pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 are 1.90 and 1.77 eV, respectively. This result is close to the calculated value of 1.86 and 1.71 eV reported in the literature [46], which is still essentially underestimated as compared with the experimental value of about 3.15 and 3.20 eV, respectively, because of the well-known limitation of GGA. The partial DOS of them show that the top of the valence bands are both mainly derived from O-2p states and the bottom of the conduction bands are both mainly composed of Ti-3d states. 3.3.2 Sr1−x Zn x TiO3 and Ba1−x Zn x TiO3 (x = 1/3, 1/6, 1/10) To investigate the effect of the Zn atoms with different concentration at the Sr site or the Ba site on the electronic properties of SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, the band structures of Zn-doped SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 are plotted in Fig. 8c–h, and the DOS and PDOS of Zn-doped SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 structures are shown in Fig. S9–S10 and Figs. 9 and 10 , respectively. The results in Fig. 8 and Fig. S8 and S9 indicate that the band gaps for Zn ions doping at the Sr or Ba sites with different concentrations all become narrowing with respect to pure SrTiO3 or BaTiO3, respectively. The reduced band gap values are 0.675, 0.555, and 0.526 eV by doping Zn at the Sr site with the molar ratio of 1/3, 1/6 and 1/10, respectively, while the reduced band gap values are 0.169, 0.118, and 0.087 eV by doping Zn at the Ba site with the molar ratio of 1/3, 1/6 and 1/10, respectively. As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the PDOS of Zn-doped SrTiO3 and Zn-doped BaTiO3 indicate that the top of the valence bands dominantly consists of O-2p orbital, while the bottom of the conduction bands is composed of Ti-3d orbital and Zn-3d orbital. Furthermore, with the increasing of the concentration of Zn atom, the contribution of Zn-3d orbital to the conduction bands becomes larger, which results in that the band gaps become narrowing for Zn-doped SrTiO3 and Zn-doped BaTiO3 and the band gap values become smaller with the increasing of the concentration of Zn atom. Such a result is consistent with the diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (Fig. 4). On the basis of the crystal structures and electronic properties discussed above, we can conclude that Zn atoms doping at the Sr or Ba sites are responsible for the red shifts of the absorption edge for in Zn-doped SrTiO3 and Zn-doped BaTiO3 systems, as well as the change of the band structures of them. In comparison with the relatively flat CB of pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, the CB of Zn-doped SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 show a large dispersion (see Fig. 8a–h). The relativity of E and ν is known as ν = ∇ k E(k)/ħ, where E is the energy of the electron, and ν is the velocity of the electron. If ∇ k E(k) is large (band is largely dispersed), ν is also large, suggesting that the mobility of the photogenerated electrons should be strong [37,59]. In other words, large disperse bands should give rise to high carrier mobility, which is a critically preferable property for the application as an active photocatalyst. Therefore, according to the above viewpoint, the photocatalytic water splitting activities of Zn-doped SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 should be better than those of pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3. These theoretical analyses are well consistent with the experimental result that there are dramatic improvements of photocatalytic water splitting activities for 1 and 2 than pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3. Furthermore, it is noted that rare-earth ions, alkali metal ions or alkaline-earth metal ions doped at A-sites of perovskite-type oxides have been rarely investigated to enhance the activity of photocatalytic water splitting into H2 in the literature because these foreign ions do not effect the conduction band or valence band structures of the photocatalysts [47]. Unlike the doping of rare-earth ions, alkali metal ions or alkaline-earth metal ions, herein, we confirmed that the doping of Zinc ions at A-sites in SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 could change the band structures of them and result in the tremendous improvement of photocatalytic properties."
10,Conclusions,"Zn-doped SrTiO3 (Sr2/3Zn1/3TiO3 (1)) and Zn-doped BaTiO3 (Ba5/6Zn1/6TiO3 (2)) have been successfully synthesized by sol–gel method. The experimental results indicated that Zn ions doped at the A-site was propitious to improve the photocatalytic activity for water splitting. Under ultraviolet light irradiation, both 1 and 2 loaded without cocatalysts showed good activity for reduction of water to H2 with a small quantity of ethanol (∼3%) as a sacrificial reagent. In addition, interestingly, 1 and 2 still showed production efficiencies of H2 from pure water without cocatalysts loading. The photocatalytic mechanisms of them were explored through theoretical method, which indicated that the substitutional doping of Zn ions could change the crystal and band structures and significantly promote carrier mobility of the catalysts, which results in good photocatalytic activities. This also demonstrated that the suitable ions substitutional doped at the A-sites of perovskite-type oxides could markedly enhance their photocatalytic activities for the first time. However, these photocatalysts are not active under visible light for the splitting of water. Further research work is being carried out in our group to obtain some catalysts that can be used under visible light for overall photocatalytic water splitting."
