0,Introduction,"Synthesis of complicated amines with a particular structure is of great practical interest because of the wide scope of their applications, such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, agrochemicals, functionalized materials, and polymers. Based on recent studies, amines containing terpenoid fragments, synthesized from renewable raw materials, have been shown to be of importance for development of new pharmaceuticals and its intermediates [1–4]. In general, natural terpenoids, based on multiples of a five-carbon isoprene subunit, represent a large and diverse class of natural organic compounds that often have biological activity and are widely used as important organic platform molecules in the development of new medicines, as well as in the synthesis of fine chemicals and intermediates [1,4–7]. The traditional method of amine synthesis using alkyl halides often did not allow the formation of a target product in appropriate yields due to overalkylation or competitive elimination [8]. Furthermore, the method has significant disadvantages in terms of practical and ecological considerations. An effective approach to controlled production of complex amines is catalytic one-pot alcohol amination proceeding via consecutive dehydrogenation of the alcohol used as a starting material to the carbonyl compound, further reaction with amine, and CN bond hydrogenation by hydrogen generated in the first step (Fig. 1 ) [9]. At the same time, the complex process efficiency preserves only when the impact of the side reaction, for example competitive hydrogenation of other unsaturated CC bonds consuming hydrogen formed during the reaction or isomerization, is minimized, which is especially important in the case of terpenoids that are highly reactive. In our previous work, it was demonstrated that the gold catalyst promoted monoterpenoid myrtenol amination with aniline [10–12] without a noticeable contribution of side reactions such as reduction of the reactive CC group of myrtenol by hydrogen formed in the first step, isomerization, and racemization. Moreover, efficient approaches to enhancing the amine yield by introducing molecular hydrogen or its generation in situ from hydrogen donors over Au/ZrO2 catalysts required for CN bond hydrogenation were presented [13,14]. Application of gold catalysts unlike those commonly applied for hydrogenation, copper [15], ruthenium and palladium [16], provided controlled hydrogenation of CC and/or CN groups by regulating the reaction conditions. These results revealed the potential of gold catalysts for synthesis of complicated amines possessing a pinene moiety via one-pot amination using myrtenol and aniline with an Au/ZrO2 catalyst. At the same time, the question arises of the reaction scope, namely if the developed method is applicable for different terpene alcohols and amines. This is of interest due to the lack of systematic studies on efficient catalytic methods for valuable terpene amine synthesis. This study was focused on the regularities of amine synthesis via one-pot alcohol amination over a gold catalyst using monoterpene alcohols and primary amines with different structures. The effect of the substrate structure was explored, aiming at the development of approaches to efficient synthesis of amines containing a terpenoid fragment and subsequently the application of this method for the production of potential pharmacophores. Based on our recent work [10,12], Au/ZrO2 subjected to an oxidative pretreatment was selected as an optimal catalyst for terpene alcohol amination."
1,Experimental/methodology,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The same sample of Au/ZrO2 catalyst described in detail in our previous work was used [10]. Commercial monoclinic ZrO2 (Alfa Aesar) with surface area 110 m2/g, pore volume 1.21 cm3/g, and pore diameter 6.6 nm was selected as a support, and was used for catalyst preparation in powder form with the particle sizes below 40 μm. Au/ZrO2 catalyst (3 wt%, according to ICP) was synthesized by a deposition–precipitation technique using HAuCl4 (Alfa-Aesar) as a gold precursor and urea as a precipitating agent, similarly to a procedure described elsewhere [17]. To remove the excess of chloride after gold deposition, the sample was washed with a solution of NH4OH (pH ca. 10), as in [18,19]. Thereafter, the catalyst was washed with deionized water, filtered, and dried at room temperature for 24 h. Before the catalytic tests, the sample was oxidized in air flow under a temperature increase to 350 °C with a ramp rate of 20 °C/min. The prepared Au/ZrO2 catalyst was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a Varian Liberty 110 ICP emission spectrometer. The specific surface area and pores of the samples were determined by the BET method by physisorption of nitrogen in Tristar II 3020 Micromeritics equipment. Prior to measurements, the samples were treated in vacuum (0.05 mbar) at 350 °C for 12 h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with a JEOL 2010 microscope. Before TEM measurements, the samples were dispersed in isopropanol and dropped onto a copper grid coated with a carbon film. To estimate the mean diameter of Au nanoparticle, more than 250 particles were counted. The mean diameter (d m) of particles was calculated using the equation (1) d m = ∑ i ( x i d i ) ∑ i x i , where xi is the number of particles with diameter di . The electronic state of gold species was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a Kratos AXIS 165 photoelectron spectrometer using monochromatic AlKα radiation (h = 1486.58 eV) and a fixed analyzer pass energy of 20 eV. All measured binding energies (BE) were referred to the C1s line of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV. The spectrum fitting was done using Shirley background estimation over the energy range of the fit."
3,Catalytic experiments,"2.2 Catalytic experiments (-)-Myrtenol (SAFC, ≥95%), (-)-nopol (Aldrich, 98%), (-)-perillyl alcohol (Aldrich, ≥96%), aniline (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%), benzylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%), phenethylamine (Aldrich, 99%), 3-aminopyridine (Aldrich, 99%), 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine (Aldrich, ≥97%), 4-bromoaniline (Aldrich, 97%) and 4-methylaniline (Aldrich, 99%) were used as substrates. Liquid-phase alcohol amination was performed in a stainless steel reactor equipped with an electromagnetic stirrer (1100 rpm) and a sampling system. A mixture of an alcohol (1 mmol), a primary amine (1 mmol) and Au/ZrO2 catalyst (92 mg) in toluene (10 ml) was used. Typically, the reaction was carried out under N2 (9 bar) at 180 °C. In some cases, 2-propanol was added into the reaction mixture prior to the experiment in an amount of 0.5 mmol. The measurements of catalytic activity were performed in the kinetic regime. The impact of internal diffusion was determined through estimation of the Weisz–Prater criterion [11]. The impacts of external diffusion and mass transfer limitations through the liquid–solid interface were evaluated by the corresponding criterion calculation [20,21]."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis Aliquots were withdrawn from the reactor at appropriate time intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography using an SLB-5 ms column (length 30 m, inner diameter 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm and gas carrier He, 40 ml/min) and a flame ionization detector operating at 300 °C. Additionally, the products’ structure was confirmed by analysis with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (Agilent 7000 GC/MS Triple Quad, HP-5MS column) as well as 1H and 13C NMR. 1H and 13C NMR spectra: Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer (500.13 MHz (1H) and 125.76 MHz (13C)) in the CDCl3 solutions of the substances; chemical shifts δ in ppm rel. to residual chloroform [δ(H) 7.24, δ(C) 76.90 ppm], J in Hz. The compounds’ structures were elucidated by analyzing NMR spectra of 1H and 13C with the attraction of the dual resonance spectra of 1H–1H, two-dimensional spectra of the heteronuclear 13C–1H correlation on the straight constants of spin–spin interaction (CH COSY, 1 J C,H 160 Hz). The signal multiplicity in 13C NMR spectra was determined from J modulation (JMOD). Elemental composition was determined by mass spectra recorded on an Agilent 7200 Accurate Mass Q-TOF GC/MS with ionization by electron impact 70 eV (HP-5MS column). 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the obtained amines are presented in the Supplementary Materials. Selectivity to a particular product was calculated based on the following equation: selectivity yield of the product/total yield of all products."
5,Results,"To explore the effect of the substrate structure on the catalytic behavior of the gold catalyst and to develop approaches for synthesis of different terpene amines, the structure of both terpene alcohol and a primary amine was varied (Fig. 2 ). The compounds were selected taking into account their potential biological activity. Monocyclic and bicyclic monoterpene alcohols as well as aromatic and aliphatic primary amines were used. The same sample of Au (3 wt%)/ZrO2 catalyst pre-treated under an oxidizing atmosphere with gold particle size 2.5 nm, selected previously as the optimal one in terms of the target amine yield [10,12], was used in the current study. Detailed Au/ZrO2 catalyst characterization was presented earlier in [10]. The optimal catalyst was determined based on our systematic study on the effect of support nature [10] and the catalyst redox pretreatment [12]. Briefly, the catalytic performance in myrtenol amination with aniline was shown to be influenced by the acid–base properties of the selected catalyst supports [10], which can be also modified by the catalyst pretreatment type [12]. A series of nanosized gold catalysts over different metal oxides, including ZrO2, Al2O3, CeO2, MgO, and La2O3, were tested to explore the role of the support [10]. Zirconia-supported gold catalyst with both acidic and basic surface sites promoted an optimum consecutive myrtenol transformation in terms of the target amine yield. Gold supported on ceria, lanthana and magnesia exhibited predominant formation of the corresponding imine, along with significant accumulation of the intermediate aldehyde, caused by a lack of aniline on the catalyst surface. The catalytic activity and selectivity to the secondary amine increased with an increase in the electronegativity of the metal ion in metal oxide supports, determining the acid–base properties of metal oxides. According to the plausible reaction mechanism, the basic sites on metal oxide surfaces are required for the initial alcohol activation to give an alkoxide intermediate, while availability of the protonic groups is important for primary amine accumulation on the surface and target product formation [10]. On the other hand, the support basic properties and therefore the catalytic performance were demonstrated to be regulated by the catalyst redox pretreatment [12]. A prereduced gold catalyst supported on zirconia was shown to be more effective in alcohol activation, while a once preoxidized catalyst promoted formation of the target amine with high selectivity [12]. An oxidative pretreatment provided more effective removal of the residual ammonia acting as a modifier of the support basic properties. Note that ammonia was formed as a result of decomposition/transformation of NH4OH and/or urea used during the catalyst preparation. Furthermore, cationic gold species catalyzing β-hydride elimination of the alkoxide intermediate and then hydride ion stabilization, as well as transfer to form the final product, were shown to be regulated by the catalyst activation type [12]. According to XPS data, zirconia-supported gold catalyst after oxidative treatment was characterized by the presence of cationic gold species in an amount of 23.9% [10], which was decreased up to 13.7% after reductive treatment."
6,Effect of primary amine structure,"3.1 Effect of primary amine structure First, myrtenol amination using different amines was studied using equimolar amounts of substrate in toluene under a nitrogen pressure of 9 bar at 180 °C. The results are collected in Table 1 . Both myrtenol conversion and selectivity to the target amines were evaluated. The product of controlled hydrogenation with the preserved unsaturated CC bond in the myrtenol fragment (amine 1) was considered to be the target product (amine 1) (Fig. 3 ). The obtained results revealed a noticeable influence of the amine structure on the catalytic behavior (Table 1). Let us consider first aniline derivatives, namely 4-methylaniline and 4-bromoaniline, which have electron-donating and -withdrawing groups, respectively. In the case of 4-methylaniline, a slight decrease in the initial reaction rate, as well as selectivity to a desired amine compared to aniline, was observed. The decrease in selectivity to the desired amine is determined by lower hydrogen transfer to the CN bond compared to aniline. Furthermore, formation of myrtenal (intermediate product) was detected in the reaction mixture, showing some limitations caused by an additional substituent in the aromatic ring (Fig. 3). At the same time, the last step of hydrogen transfer to the CN bond was also shown to be limited by nonspecific alcohol dehydrogenation, involving both gold nanoparticles and the support and giving hydrogen only in the former case, when gold stabilizes a hydride ion, as was earlier discussed in [22,23]. In our study, the amine yield was demonstrated to be enhanced by introduction of a hydrogen donor such as 2-propanol or formic acid [14]. 2-Propanol provided a lower rate of CC bond hydrogenation than formic acid [14]. The maximum yield of the desired product (i.e., amine 1) of 68%, reached at the molar ratio of 2-propanol/myrtenol = 0.5 at nearly complete myrtenol conversion, was higher than 52% in the absence of any additive (Table 1) [14]. Indeed, addition of 0.5 mmol of 2-propanol into the reaction mixture during myrtenol amination with 4-methylaniline led to a selectivity increase to amine from 43 to 51% at almost complete myrtenol conversion. Myrtenol amination with an aniline derivative bearing an electron-withdrawing group such as 4-bromoaniline proceeded 1.6 times faster than with aniline. Interestingly, in this case, the products with a saturated CC bond in the initial myrtenol structure were entirely detected in the reaction mixture, even in the absence of an additional hydrogen source. Among the reaction products, the imine with a saturated CC bond was mainly detected in ca. twofold lower amounts of the corresponding amine due to the side hydrogen consumption in CC bond hydrogenation. Unexpected activity in CC bond hydrogenation seems to be related to catalyst modification by the reaction substrates or to the electronic effect of the substituent on the reactivity of the intermediate via CC bond polarization. Other amines used in the current study, namely benzylamine, 3-aminopyridine, phenethylamine and its derivative 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine (Fig. 2), were selected based on their potential application in terms of biological activity of the corresponding final product. Thus, benzylamine is used for synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Lacosamide [24]. The synthesis of Pirenzepine, an antiulcerative drug, proceeds via 2-chloro-3-aminopyridine, an intermediate derived from chlorination of 3-aminopyridine [25]. A fragment of phenylethylamine and some of its hydroxy and methoxy derivatives are present in many natural neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and adrenaline, and in psychoactive drugs [26]. The replacement of aniline with benzylamine did not affect the initial rate and myrtenol conversion, while significantly influencing side reactions. After the first 2 h of the reaction, the selectivity to the desired amine was 36%, decreasing to 3% after 6 h because of CC bond hydrogenation in the target amine (Table 1). Moreover, N-benzylidene-1-phenylmethanamine was formed as a result of benzylamine reactions [27,28], most likely via benzylamine dehydrogenation (Fig. 4 ). Additional hydrogen produced in the reactor may lead to hydrogenation of CC bonds in the target amine or/and corresponding imine, diminishing the product selectivity. Further elongation of the chain length in the amino group with one CH2 unit by using phenethylamine decreased the initial reaction rate, resulting predominantly in the amine and the corresponding imine formation without any side reactions (Table 1). After 24 h they were formed in nearly equal amounts with selectivity 52 and 46%, respectively, at myrtenol conversion of 70%. The addition of 2-propanol into the reaction mixture during myrtenol amination with phenethylamine in an amount of 0.5 mmol resulted in an increase of selectivity to the desired amine up to 69% after 16 h without noticeable changes in the initial reaction rate. Myrtenol amination with a phenethylamine derivative, 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine, also was slower than with phenethylamine and aniline (Table 1). At the same time, the selectivity to the target amine noticeably increased. It was about 72% at myrtenol conversion of 13% after 16 h and can be even further increased to 80%, negligibly influencing the reaction rate after 2-propanol addition (0.5 mmol). The reaction rate decreased ten fold in the case of 3-aminopyridine compared to aniline whereas the impact on CC bond hydrogenation was negligible (Table 1). The rate of the CC hydrogenation step seems to be affected by the amine structure. Accumulation of the aldehyde observed during the reaction with 3-aminopyridine was proposed to be caused by competitive adsorption by the amino group and the pyridine ring, resulting in lower imine formation. In fact, such features increased the desired amine yield, suppressing the side reactions. Note that the results on imine 1 hydrogenation demonstrated that in the presence of Au/ZrO2 catalyst the consecutive hydrogenation of CN bonds followed by CC bond hydrogenation occurred [13]. At the same time, the final step of CN bond hydrogenation did not occur efficiently enough with the imine predominant formation. The selectivity to amine (about 20–23%) was expected to be increased by hydrogen donor addition in the reaction mixture. Introduction of 2-propanol (0.5 mmol) indeed led to a slight increase of the selectivity toward amine equal to 30% at myrtenol conversion of 33%."
7,Effect of monoterpene alcohol structure,"3.2 Effect of monoterpene alcohol structure The effect of monoterpene alcohol structure was studied using primary bicyclic alcohols, such as myrtenol and nopol, as well as a primary monocyclic alcohol, perillyl alcohol. The elongation of the carbon chain between the pinane ring and the hydroxyl group in nopol therefore gave a nonconjugated system, which diminished the initial reaction rate tenfold compared with myrtenol. The desired amine was generated with a relatively high selectivity of ca. 76% at nopol conversion of 40% (Table 2 ). The conjugation of the carbonyl group with the CC bond seems to influence side reactions, increasing the impact of CC bond hydrogenation in the case of conjugated systems. Primary monocyclic perillyl alcohol consumption at 180 °C was fast, resulting in a complex product mixture (Table 2). Monocyclic perillyl alcohol with a conjugated hydroxyl group seems to be reactive in terms of secondary transformations. The amine was detected only in small amounts. At the same time, perillyl alcohol side reactions at a lower reaction temperature of 160 °C were less prominent, giving imines and amines as the main reaction products, with substantial hydrogenation of the CC bond (Table 2). Thus, compared with a bicyclic terpene alcohol a monocyclic one was shown to be more reactive, resulting in a noticeable impact on the side reactions."
8,Discussion,"The initial amine structure was shown to affect myrtenol conversion and selectivity to the reaction products significantly. The initial rate of myrtenol consumption depends on its adsorption on Au/ZrO2 surface and further dehydrogenation. Adsorption behavior can be tuned by steric properties of the amine, which should also be able to adsorb on the surface, and its basicity. In particular, the acid–base properties of the support were shown to affect the catalytic activity noticeably [10,12]. At the reaction start, basic sites on metal oxide surfaces are required for the initial alcohol activation, followed by further β-hydride elimination with accumulation of subtracted H species on the surfaces of gold nanoparticles [10,12]. Recently, the presence of residual ammonia during the reductive pretreatment of catalyst was demonstrated to affect the catalytic activity in a positive way because of support basic properties modification [12]. In a similar manner, the amine can act as a modifying agent. No correlation, however, can be found between basicity data for amines and activity (Table 3 ). In fact, the amount of amine seems to be too negligible to modify the support active sites noticeably. At the same time, according to the plausible reaction mechanism [10], cationic gold species Auδ+ are proposed to be important for β-hydride elimination of alcohol and therefore for hydrogen transfer. The Au/ZrO2 catalyst selected for this study was characterized by the presence of gold cations located only at the gold-support interface. The availability of these active sites can be limited by competitive interaction with amines, influencing the initial step of alcohol dehydrogenation. Generally, a significant decrease in the reaction rate was observed for aliphatic amines with a higher basicity, except benzylamine. In the case of benzylamine, the side transformation to N-benzylidene-1-phenylmethanamine likely was the reason for the amine removal from the active sites. Interestingly, for aromatic amines, the reaction rate of myrtenol consumption decreased as pK a increased (Table 3), with the higher rate being reached in the case of 4-bromoaniline. At the same time, some modification of Auδ+ active sites also cannot be excluded without additional study. On the other hand, electron-donating characteristics of substituents in aromatic amines can affect their reactivity. From this point of view, the reaction kinetics is determined by the different reactivity of the substrates and the intermediates on the catalyst surface. The effect of the substituent nature on the reaction kinetics in terms of physical organic chemistry can be evaluated using the approach of Hammett for substrates with substituents in the aromatic ring or by Taft equation valid for aliphatic substrates [29]. In our case, an attempt to apply this relation and to quantify the substituent nature effect was performed for aniline derivatives using the Hammett equation, (2) log k j k H = σ j · ρ , where kj is the rate constant of myrtenol dehydrogenation, k H is the value corresponding to R = H, ρ is the reaction constant characteristic of a particular reaction, and σj is the substituent constant. A linear plot of log k j k H vs. substituent parameters was observed (Fig. 5 ), confirming the effect of the substituent nature of the amine on the reaction kinetics via the apparently different reactivity of the reaction intermediate on the catalyst surface. The reaction constant was estimated to be 0.8. In general, a positive value of the reaction constant (0 < ρ < 1) shows that electronic density is removed from the reaction center, facilitating the reaction, resulting in a negative charge at the reaction center in the transition state of the rate-limiting step, and therefore the rate is accelerated by electron-withdrawing substituents [29]. Particularly in the case of 4-bromoaniline with an electron-withdrawing group, CC bond polarization favors its hydrogenation. The substituent seems to influence the reactivity of intermediate during the hydrogen transfer step. The substituent nature was proposed to affect the catalytic behavior more significantly than the limitations related to substrate accumulation on the catalyst surface."
9,Conclusions,"One-pot terpene alcohol amination was studied using both terpene alcohols and amines with different structures, selected with the aim of synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The substrate structure was shown to affect noticeably both the initial reaction rate of myrtenol dehydrogenation and selectivity to the desired amine. In general, introduction of functional groups, elongation of the carbon chain in the functional moiety, and its sterically hindered position led to a decrease of the reaction rate, elevating, however, selectivity to the desired amine in some cases. Both aromatic and aliphatic amines were used for myrtenol amination. The substrate structure effect on the catalytic behavior was considered in terms of both the substrate accumulation on the catalyst surface and the different reactivity of the substrates and their intermediates. In the former case, stronger adsorption of more basic amines on the cationic gold species can retard the initial step of alcohol dehydrogenation. At the same time, a more noticeable influence was proposed to be related to the nature of the substituent and the reactivity of intermediates. Myrtenol amination with aniline derivatives follows the Hammett correlation. The substituent seems to influence the intermediate reactivity during the hydrogen transfer step. For some substrates, introduction of 0.5 mmol of 2-propanol increases selectivity to amine by 8–18% without significant changes in the catalytic activity. Besides myrtenol, amination of a primary bicyclic alcohol, nopol, and a primary monocyclic alcohol, perillyl alcohol, with aniline was also studied. The rate of alcohol dehydrogenation decreased 10-fold using nopol, which after dehydrogenation gave an unconjugated aldehyde group. Selectivity to the desired amine in the latter case increased via selective hydrogen transfer to CN bonds. Monocyclic perillyl alcohol was more reactive than myrtenol, giving a complex product mixture at 180 °C with the amine present only in small amounts. The reaction temperature decrease led to a more controlled transformation of perillyl alcohol to imines and amines, with predominant CC bond hydrogenation."
