0,Introduction,"Fossil fuel extraction is becoming more difficult and expensive, and burning this fuel accelerates climate change. Therefore, there has been an intense interest in developing microorganisms that can ferment energy crops or waste biomass to renewable fuels (Ragauskas et al., 2006). Understanding what conditions allow organisms to thrive while producing desired products like alcohols or hydrocarbons may enable the use of microorganisms to produce these products. Physical chemists have understood that all chemical reactions are controlled by kinetic or thermodynamic mechanisms (Chang, 1981). With kinetic control, the rates of reactions depend on substrate concentrations or enzyme activities, and these enzyme activities in turn may depend on microbial growth or enzyme synthesis. The profile of products formed depends on relative rates of different competing reactions. With thermodynamic control, the feasibility of reactions and the availability of pathway branches depend on the second law of thermodynamics. This law governs whether or not a reaction can proceed spontaneously in the forward direction based on the concentrations of reactants and products. Biologists have focused on controlling kinetic elements of fermentation such as enzyme function, microbial activity, gene expression, or provision of substrates. However, the present analysis is based on the theory that fermentation is often controlled by thermodynamics. For example, in a mixed-culture anaerobic bioreactor (e.g. cow׳s rumen, and anaerobic digester) as soon as a glucose molecule is released by digestion of cellulose there are several microbes that can transport it into their cells and metabolize it to any number of products. The amount of energy that any particular organism can obtain depends on the concentration of all products of the reaction relative to all reactants. Since the free glucose concentration is very low due to competition among microorganisms in the fermentation, and the products of fermentation are removed slowly, only very efficient microbes can use the low concentration of glucose at all. And they can only use it when concentrations of the products which they produce are low. Therefore, when their products start to build up, they can no longer obtain Gibbs energy by converting the reactant to a product, and they leave the glucose behind for another microorganism that produces a different product. As the different products build up, the free glucose concentration increases enabling higher concentrations of the original products. In this way, a predictable ratio of products is produced. In chemistry, whether or not a reaction can proceed spontaneously in the forward direction is represented by the change in Gibbs energy (∆G), which can be calculated based on the ratio of products and reactants in the system (Chang, 1981). Using this calculation, a strongly negative ∆G indicates that the reaction could proceed strongly in the forward direction without the addition of energy to the system. A strongly positive value of ∆G indicates the reaction cannot proceed in the forward direction without addition of energy to the system, and it may even run in the reverse direction. Previous research demonstrated by three different methods that the profile of products within some fermentation systems (e.g. cow׳s rumen) is explained as near-equilibrium in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. First, the values of ∆G are near zero for many reactions in the rumen (Kohn and Boston, 2000; Ungerfeld and Kohn, 2006), or a manure or a sewage digester (Hoh and Cord-Ruwisch, 1997; Jackson and McInerney, 2002) including methane or acetic acid production from CO2 and H2 and interconversion of acids. Furthermore, the rates of interconversion of one acid to another are similar in each direction as measured using isotopic labels (Ungerfeld and Kohn, 2006). Finally, perturbation studies in which a certain acid is added to the rumen result in a decrease in production of the added acid and an increase in conversion to other acids (Seal and Parker, 1994). All of these results support the theory that the profile of acids and gases in these fermentation systems is near thermodynamic equilibrium. The current studies use the theory describing the direction of metabolite flow in fermentation as a function of thermodynamics to define conditions for production of desired biofuels and for enrichment and isolation of bacteria that make those fuels. Since many fermentation systems are near equilibrium, when these systems are perturbed, the rates of reactions adjust to restore the equilibrium. In the process, microbes that carry out the favored reactions thrive and grow. Under these conditions, microbes can be enriched and isolated to produce desired products."

2,Digestion and fermentation.,"2.1 Digestion and fermentation. In vitro digestion was orchestrated according to Goering and Van Soest (1970). Rumen fluid samples were taken from a non-lactating fistulated Holstein cow in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Contents from a cow׳s rumen, or other source when indicated, were prepared by blending for 1min and straining through four layers of cheese cloth followed by glass wool. Buffers, macrominerals, microminerals, tryptic digest of casein, ammonia, sulfide, and cysteine reducing agents, and resazurin were used (Goering and Van Soest, 1970). Bicarbonate salts were replaced with equi-molar phosphate salts when not using carbon dioxide as the headspace gas. Starting pH of medium was 6.8. These digestions were typically carried out in flasks or test tubes under anaerobic conditions at 39°C. Media were boiled under 100% CO2 or N2 (for H2 preparations). Carbon dioxide or nitrogen, when used as the headspace gases, was run through a copper column to remove residual O2 before perfusing over rumen contents and into containers to maintain anaerobic conditions. The same media formulae were used for initial enrichment, agar roll tubes, broths, slant tubes, and agar plates. However, roll tubes, slant tubes and agar plates also contained 2% agar (BactoAgar). Media used for pure cultures (everything but the initial enrichments) were combined with 20% clarified rumen fluid (centrifuged at 12,000g for 30min) to provide potential unknown growth factors."
3,Enrichment,"2.2 Enrichment Media usually contained 2% timothy hay ground through a 1-mm screen of a Wiley mill. In other cases, the source of energy was VFA, and in other cases only synthesis gases (e.g. CO2 or CO and H2) provided energy to select for organisms that grow on synthesis gases. The rationale for the different sources of carbohydrate or other source of energy was to enrich for microorganisms that could digest and utilize the type of carbohydrate for energy. Media (45ml) were transferred to each 140-ml Wheaton bottle under perfusion of gas, and rumen inocula (5ml) were added to each flask. Flasks were incubated in a shaking water bath for at least 48h. New flasks were prepared with 45ml of media with additional energy, and 5ml of subculture was added from the previous fermentation. These flasks were again incubated for 48h or longer and again sub-sampled. Each enrichment process typically included at least three cycles of sub-culturing and growth. For each enrichment and roll tube, the temperature of incubation typically was 39°C. To prevent wash out of some slower growing microorganisms, some enrichments were carried out for greater than 48h. For example, enrichments in high alcohol medium or using CO2 and H2 for energy were continued for up to 10 days and ended when signs of active fermentation were evident. The enrichments were conducted while maintaining conditions to favor enrichment of the microorganisms of interest. Such conditions are defined for specific examples that follow. In general, provision of undesired products (e.g. VFA, gases) in the fermentation shifts metabolism against further production of those products because the fermentations are near equilibrium. Therefore, the desired products were maintained in low concentration relative to the other products to increase further production of only the desired products."
4,Isolation,"2.3 Isolation Isolation of microorganisms was carried out under conditions to select for organisms that are more likely to produce an alcohol, or produce an alkane greater than one-carbon in length. Specific modifications to isolate organisms that produce each type of product are provided as examples. In general, conditions were established to be thermodynamically favorable for desired end products and to be unfavorable for end products that were not desired. Sterile roll tubes were used to isolate colonies from sources of microorganisms with or without enrichment (Hungate, 1950). The media were transferred to sterile tubes with agar media while still hot from autoclaving. Tubes were cooled to 55°C and inoculated under H2 and CO2 pressures. The microbial inocula were diluted serially in media to obtain cultures from 1 to 10–14 viable cells per 0.5ml inocula. Roll tubes were prepared for each level of dilution, but concentrating on the dilutions best able to separate individual colonies depending on the source. Once inoculated, tubes were perfused with gas, stoppered, and rolled on ice to make the gel harden. Tubes were incubated for 1 to 10d at 39°C and independent colonies were selected from these."
5,Maintenance,"2.4 Maintenance Colonies were selected among the colonies in roll tubes and transferred to broth for short-term maintenance. The broth was of the same composition as media for other purposes, but did not contain agar, and contained a source of energy such as 0.8% cellobiose, Avicel®, filter paper, timothy hay, or gases. Once the tubes for broth were prepared and capped, they were autoclaved before use. The microbial inoculum was added using a sterile needle and syringe. Broth cultures were maintained at 39°C until they became cloudy. Broth cultures (5% final concentration, vol/vol) were transferred to new media three times per week. After two to three cultures, 0.1ml culture was transferred to a slant culture containing 2% agar with new energy source in a 25-ml tube with 10ml media on a slant to increase surface area. The inoculum was spread by streaking on top the agar, which was maintained under CO2, N2 or H2 or other gas as needed for the type of culture. These were initially incubated at 39°C until colonies formed (16h), and then stored at 25°C or 4°C for up to a month. Cloudy broth cultures were also stored by adding 10% glycerol (final volume) and freezing in liquid nitrogen; once frozen, these colonies were stored at –80°C. Sterile conditions were used for pure cultures that digest pure or artificial feedstock. Media were added to Wheaton bottles or tubes with an energy source and other nutrients, the containers stoppered and autoclaved. The inocula were added through the stopper with a sterile needle."
6,Screening,"2.5 Screening Screening of microorganisms addresses whether they can use a certain substrate and convert it to desired product. Fiber-digesting isolates were screened for digestion using Avicel® and timothy hay (NDF disappearance measured). New isolates from Avicel® or carboxymethyl cellulose in the roll tubes were also screened this way, with a higher percentage of successful fiber digesters compared to isolates from cellobiose media. In fact, high fiber digestion is a property of nearly all isolates from a source of fiber in the roll tube or plate used for isolation. Screening was also performed using alcohols in the tube to determine the ability to digest fiber in the presence of a high concentration of alcohol (e.g. 6 or 10% by volume). Screening of organisms that produce an organic compound from synthesis gases is undertaken by growing the organisms in the presence of the optimal concentration of those gases for production of the desired organic compound (defined by thermodynamics in the following section) with no other energy source. Cell growth was measured by changes in optical density (610nm). After digestion with various substrates for a period of 1 to 5 days, the volatile fatty acids (VFA), alcohols and alkanes were measured by gas chromatography and compared to initial concentrations."
7,Analyses,"2.6 Analyses Volatile fatty acids in the broth cultures were determined by gas chromatography (GC; model 6890; Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using 2-ethylbutyrate as an internal standard in a 4-mm glass column packed with GP 15% SP-1220/1% H3PO4 on Chromosorb WAW (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20ml/min, and the injector, column, and detector temperatures were 220, 172, 200°C, respectively. Alcohols in the broth cultures were determined by the GC (7890A Agilent Technology) equipped with FID and a 2-mm glass column packed with 5% Carbowax 20M, matrix 60/80 Carbopack (Supelco Inc.). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 40ml/min, and the injector, column, and detector temperatures were 200, 100, 180°C, respectively. Broth samples (1ml) were centrifuged at 12,000g for 15min and preserved with 3% phosphoric acid (acids) or 2% sodium azide (alcohols) before analyzing without derivativization. Hydrocarbons were determined in headspace gas on the same GC as used for VFA with a FID and a 10-m stainless steel column packed with GP 23% SP-1700 on 80/100 Chromosorb P AW (Supelco Inc.). Helium as carrier gas flowed at 25mL/min and the injector, column, and detector temperatures were 150, 100, 150°C, respectively. External standards for straight-chain alkanes were used to confirm elution time, but peaks for hydrocarbons with greater than six carbons and branching or double bonds were not differentiated. Headspace CO2 and hydrogen gases were analyzed by the GC using a thermal conductivity detector and a 4.6-m packed column packed with 60/80 Carboxen 100 (Supelco Inc.). Argon as carrier gas flowed at 20ml/min. Injector and detector temperatures were 250°C for both and oven temperature was between 50 and 150 with ramps to separate gases. Concentrations were determined using the area compare to external standards that eluted at the same time points. For all liquid samples initial concentrations were compared to concentrations at later time points."
8,Phylogenetical methods,"2.7 Phylogenetical methods The phylogenetical relationship of isolates to other microorganisms was determined by sequence of the 16S ribosomal DNA. Twenty bacterial isolates were selected for their ability to convert a high percentage of cellobiose to ethanol, or ability to produce ethanol even when ethanol concentrations were greater than 6% by volume. Each isolate was purified and plated on slant agar tubes and sent to an outside contractor. The contractor performed colony PCR using a forward (8FPL, AGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and reverse (1492RPL; GGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT) primer and verified fragments using gel electrophoresis. The PCR product was sequenced using an automated sequencer with the same primers. Contiguous 16S rDNA sequences obtained with forward or reverse primers were edited using Chromas Lite 2.01 (Technelysium Pty Ltd.) and assembled using CAP3 program (Huang and Madan, 1999). After the two sequences for each organism were assembled, the sequence was compared to the NCBI database against all nucleic acid deposits, accepting 97% or greater homology with identified bacterial 16S rDNA as potentially the same species. Four isolates did not produce PCR product and were not sequenced."
9,Theory and calculations,
10,Theory,"3.1 Theory This research is based on the theory that fermentation systems drive toward thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, when the concentration of a product accumulates relative to a substrate such as glucose, fermentative organisms can obtain less energy by converting the substrate to the product. Organisms that produce a different product from the same substrate can therefore obtain greater energy and will have more opportunity to capture energy to grow. This theory was used to isolate bacteria that produce a high concentration of alcohol or alkanes from cellulosic biomass or synthesis gases (e.g. CO, CO2, and H2)."
11,Calculations,"3.2 Calculations The changes in Gibbs energy under standard conditions (∆G°) were determined by subtracting the standard Gibbs energy of formation ( Δ G f ∘ ) of all reactants from the ∆G f° of products (Chang, 1981). The values for ∆G f° were obtained from the literature (Chang, 1981; Guthrie, 1992) for all reactants and products of interest. ∆G° at standard temperature of 298.15K ( Δ G 298 ∘ ) was adjusted for temperature of fermentation (e.g. 311K) using the Vant Hoff equation (Chang, 1981). The change in Gibbs energy (∆G) under non-standard conditions was calculated from the actual concentrations of products and reactants in the fermentation excluding ATP generation. Setting the ∆G to 0 to assume equilibrium enabled the equations to be solved for the equilibrium ratio of products to reactants with no energy available to be captured by ATP. Alternatively, the ∆G was set to 44.5kcal/mol of ATP generated and solved for assumptions of amount of ATP generated. Once these equilibrium concentrations were determined, they were used in mathematical models solving simultaneous equations representing each of several reactions occurring in the same fermentation system (e.g. same culture of one or more strains of organisms) under different sets of conditions."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Cellulosic ethanol,"4.1 Cellulosic ethanol Currently, the main biofuel produced in the world is ethanol made from corn grain in the U.S. or from cane sugar in Brazil (Ragauskas et al., 2006). However, even if all corn grain now grown in the United States were converted to ethanol, it would only satisfy about 15% of current U.S. transportation fuel needs (NRDC, 2006). Plant fiber biomass could be used instead of corn grain or sugar crops to produce liquid transportation fuels. An annual supply of one billion metric tons of dry biomass can produce 60 billion gallons of ethanol per year in the US (Perlack et al., 2005). Globally, 70 million tons of crop residues are available annually (Kim and Dale, 2003), but current use of biomass includes application to fields, which is important to maintain soil organic matter (Reijnders, 2008). Since much of the available waste biomass is located in small quantities in remote locations, a method is needed for biomass digestion and conversion that is cost effective for small-scale reactors (Kim and Dale, 2003). The process to convert plant fiber to biofuels requires digestion of the biomass into an available intermediate such as glucose or syngas (CO, CO2 and H2) followed by fermentation of the intermediate into a fuel such as ethanol ( Fig. 1), butanol, or preferably a hydrocarbon (Ragauskas et al., 2006; Bredwell et al., 1999; Klasson et al., 1992; Lynd et al., 1991). The most efficient approach eventually might be the conversion of the plant fiber directly into the fuel using a single microbial culture that digests the fiber and excretes the desired fuel as an end product. This approach is called consolidated bioprocessing because both the digestion of the biomass and its fermentation to ethanol occur in a single step (Lynd et al., 2005; Schuster and Chin, 2013; Xu et al., 2009). Currently, the biggest limitation for consolidated bioprocessing is the availability of suitable microorganisms. Advantages and disadvantages of several natural and engineered strains have been reviewed (Lynd et al., 2005; Schuster and Chin, 2013). Cellulolytic organisms thrive in neutral pH and digest fiber when free sugar concentration is low, but ethanol production is favored by low pH and high free sugar concentration (Xu et al., 2010). Although some microbes can produce ethanol from cellulose, or they were engineered to do so, they do not continue producing ethanol when the concentration in the media exceeds a few percent (Schuster and Chin, 2013; Xu et al., 2009), and therefore ethanol separation would be cost prohibitive with any of these organisms in their present state. Bacteria were isolated in the present investigations specifically for cellulose digestion, ethanol tolerance, and ethanol production. Under certain conditions, mixed rumen microorganisms make ethanol instead of volatile fatty acids. Therefore, fermentation conditions that thermodynamically favored ethanol production were used to isolate several strains of bacteria from the cow׳s rumen that digest cellulose and make ethanol even when the ethanol concentration is high. The microorganisms harbored in the first stomach chamber or rumen of a cow or other ruminant orchestrate the fastest microbial degradation of biomass on earth. However, ethanol is not known to accumulate in the rumen under typical conditions because the produced ethanol is converted to acetate (Moomaw and Hungate, 1963). The authors hypothesized that it would be more thermodynamically favorable to make ethanol than acetate when H2 pressure was high. When incubated in the presence of high hydrogen pressure (e.g. 1bar H2), mixed cultures of microorganisms from the rumen of a cow produced ethanol from glucose, 5-carbon sugars arabinose and xylose, corn starch, or cellulose (Kohn, 2008). Therefore, the authors hypothesized that it would be possible to isolate organisms from the rumen that could digest various types of biomass directly to ethanol. We calculated that under natural ruminal conditions, conversion of biomass to ethanol is not thermodynamically favored as much as conversion to volatile fatty acids and this would explain why ethanol does not accumulate. However, as the ratio of H2 to CO2 pressure increases, ethanol and acetate production from gases become increasingly favored over their degradation until the ratio of H2 to CO2 is greater than 2 for acetate and 3 for ethanol ( Fig. 2). ∆G for conversion of ethanol to acetate decreases (becomes more feasible) as can be observed in Fig. 2 as the difference between ∆G for acetate production and ethanol production from CO2 and H2. Typically in the rumen or anaerobic digester, the ratio of H2 to CO2 is less than 0.001 (Hoh and Cord-Ruwisch, 1997; Ungerfeld and Kohn, 2006). Under such conditions, it is thermodynamically feasible to convert these gases to methane with production of 1 ATP per mole of methane, and H2 is readily used to make methane in the rumen, keeping the H2 pressure low. Synthesis of acetic acid from these gases is not feasible as the ∆G is near 0, and the positive ∆G for conversion of gases to ethanol shows that it would be feasible to degrade ethanol to acetate or CO2, but not to produce it. The low concentration of H2 is maintained by the rapid utilization of H2 by organisms like methanogens. The calculations in Fig. 2 demonstrate that ethanol is favored over ethanol degradation to CO2 in fermentation when the ratio of H2 to CO2 exceeds 3. It is thermodynamically feasible to degrade acetate and ethanol at either low or high ratios of H2 to CO2, and the released gases can be synthesized into methane if methanogens are present. The feasible concentrations of either acetate or ethanol can be calculated by setting ∆G to zero and solving for the ratio of either product to reactant gases (Chang, 1981). The feasible concentration of ethanol or acetate synthesized from CO2 and H2 (or synthesized from carbohydrate and not degraded to the gases) peaks at a ratio of 3:1 for ethanol or 2:1 for acetate. At such ratios and a single atmosphere of combined pressure, both reactions are highly feasible. In order to favor ethanol over acetate, it may be desirable to use conditions in which ethanol production is feasible but acetate production is not. Another variable that further shifts equilibrium toward ethanol is the total pressure of H2 and CO2 ( Fig. 3). At a given ratio of H2 to CO2, the ratio of equilibrium ethanol concentration to acetate concentration increases exponentially with combined pressure. Thus, when a high ratio of H2 to CO2 is used particularly with high combined pressures, ethanol becomes favored over acetate and conditions can be obtained that make it thermodynamically feasible to produce ethanol but not acetate. Adding acetate to the medium also shifts fermentation away from acetate production. Under such conditions, organisms that excrete ethanol as an end product would be favored over those that excrete CO2 and H2, acetate or other VFA. Based on these calculations, microorganisms were isolated from the rumen of a cow that could convert cellulose or cellobiose directly to ethanol, or that could convert CO2 and H2 directly to ethanol. Rumen fluid was collected from a fistulated cow fed a grass hay diet, and fluid was enriched for fiber-digesting ethanol-producing microbes by incubating in media with timothy grass hay as the main substrate under 1bar pressure of H2. Every 3 to 5 days, 10% of the culture was transferred to new media and gas headspace. For some enrichments, the media contained 6% or 10% ethanol by volume. Individual strains that grew on purified cellulose (Avicel®), filter paper, or cellobiose under H2 pressure were isolated on agar from diluted enrichments. Celluose is comprised of repeating beta-linked glucose molecules that are recalcitrant to enzymatic attack, and cellobiose is a soluble unit of two beta-linked glucose molecules. Some isolates could digest various types of biomass (e.g. cellulose, hemicellulose, grass) and convert it directly to ethanol. Most initial isolations and characterizations used cellobiose in the isolation step, and many isolates that could use cellobiose could not degrade cellulose. Isolated strains after enrichment on grass may have been cross feeders that use low concentrations of cellobiose released by other strains. Microbial cultures from the rumen converted 1% cellobiose to 0.5% ethanol increasing ethanol concentration from initial 6.0% to more than 6.5% by volume. A second addition of cellobiose further increased ethanol to more than 7.0%. For different isolated strains that converted cellobiose to ethanol, 16S-rRNA sequences of strains that converted cellobiose to ethanol were >97% homologous with Clostridium (C. bifermentans, C. sordelli, C. sporogenes), Enterococcus (E. casselflavus, E. muntii, E. sangunicola, E. faecium, E. lactis), Pediococcus (e.g P. acidilactici), Lactobacillus (eg. L. mucosae), or Staphylococcus (S. epidermidis). Based on these simple isolations, it is clear that bacteria that can digest plant fiber or cellobiose to ethanol or other alcohols are common in nature and are genetically and physiologically diverse. Using reaction conditions that make alcohol production thermodynamically favorable over other potential products makes it simple to isolate such organisms."
14,Alcohols and hydrocarbons from H2 and CO2,"4.2 Alcohols and hydrocarbons from H2 and CO2 Although microorganisms are known to produce acetic acid or ethanol from hydrogen and carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, generally only low concentrations of acetic acid or ethanol are produced (Klasson et al., 1992). Synthesis gases can be converted to alcohols or hydrocarbons using metal catalysts, but more specific biological catalysts would be more efficient and less prone to effects of contaminant gases. Under typical conditions for anaerobic digestion, the degradation of acids and alkanes is favored over their synthesis, as shown by the positive ∆G values when H2 pressure is low ( Fig. 4). However, if the ratio of H2 to CO2 approaches 3 to 1, and particularly if the pressure is increased, carbon dioxide fixation, and fatty acid elongation, fatty acid decarboxylation, and hydrogenation of fatty acids become thermodynamically favored. The authors hypothesized that organisms that produce higher concentration of ethanol than currently known could be isolated by incubating under conditions that thermodynamically favor higher concentrations. Furthermore, higher pressures and higher ratios of H2 to CO2 would favor alcohols over corresponding carboxylic acids, or longer-chain acids and alcohols over shorter-chain acids and alcohols. It might even be possible to find organisms that make alkanes instead of acids or alcohols. Therefore, it may be possible to isolate more ideal organisms for conversion of gases to fuels by increasing pressure and adjusting ratios of gases in the fermentation. Rumen fluid was taken from a fistulated cow and subjected to several 3-to-10 day enrichment incubations in media with alcohols or alkanes to increase tolerance. For example, media contained no added alcohol or alkane or 6 or 10% ethanol by volume, 4 or 6% 1-propanol, 4 or 6% 1-butanol or 5% of one of 1-hexane, 1-heptane, 1-octane or iso-octane. Headspace gas composition was initially air, N2, CO2, H2 or vacuum (0.05bar). Under these conditions, it was thermodynamically favorable to degrade alcohols or alkanes to CO2 and H2 or H2O. The organisms were grown for three to ten days while exchanging gases, 10% medium volume was removed and added to new sterile medium and the enrichment repeated. Note that organisms were enriched under conditions favoring degradation of the desired compounds with the presumption that some of such organisms would also reverse the pathway to produce the compounds under altered conditions. After several enrichment periods, diluted (up to 10−14) cultures were grown on agar plates under conditions thermodynamically favoring conversion of gases to alcohols or alkanes. Generally, conditions included a ratio of H2:CO2 of 3:1 and 1 to 2bar total gas pressure as the main energy source. Selected colonies were transferred to broth and incubated again under H2 and CO2 pressure, with molar ratio of H2 to CO2 of 3:1 and 2 to 4bar total pressure. Several colonies produced ethanol from H2 and CO2 whether or not ethanol was included in the broth at 0, 6, or 10% concentration. Isolates that produced alcohols included Enterococcus species (>97% homology with E. avium, E. faecium, E. faecalis), and Clostridium species, and unidentified strictly anaerobic gram-negative spiral rods. A strain of Enterococcus avium was examined in additional studies. When ethanol was initially included in the media at 6% concentration by volume, 3 to 4 times greater ethanol was produced from gases than when it was not included and acid production ceased. Alcohols represented greater than 90% of the measured (C2–C5) volatile fatty acids plus alcohols on a molar basis. Of the alcohol production, 83% was ethanol, 11% 1-propanol, 3% iso-propanol, and 3% 1-butanol. Cultures selected from hydrocarbon enrichments produced alkanes including 1-hexane and other hydrocarbons of similar size (C5 to C8). Forty-six of fifty isolates grew in broth, and 41 produced medium-length (C3–C8) hydrocarbons from CO2 and H2. The 41 isolates that produced alkanes were identified by 16-S rRNA, which were >97% homologous with at least one of Actinomyces sp., Enterococcus faecium, E. Hirae, Eschericia coli, Clostridium glycolicum, Proteus sp., or Tissierella sp. Previously there were no organisms known to produce medium-length hydrocarbons. Park (2005) reported that an isolate of Vibrio furnissii produced alkanes ranging from 16 to 24 carbon atoms in length. However, Wackett et al. (2007) were unable to reproduce the findings or elucidate the pathway. In the first attempt to isolate alkane-producing organisms using the second law of thermodynamics, 82% of isolated organisms produced alkanes from H2 and CO2. It is not yet known if the fuel production rates and the robustness of the organisms will allow for their use in commercial fuel production. However, the process described in this article proves the concept that it is possible to isolate organisms for biofuel or chemical production by applying the laws of thermodynamics. Classic isolation procedures grew cultures of microorganisms on a certain feedstuff and then identified the compounds that individual isolates produced. Finding an organism that produces a desired product was a matter of chance. Growing cultures in high concentrations of the desired products (e.g. ethanol or alkanes) without consideration of the thermodynamics selects for degradation of the products rather than their production. The present approach enriches for organisms that produce certain types of products at a high concentration."
15,Using thermodynamics for process control,"4.3 Using thermodynamics for process control The concept that a biological ecosystem can be controlled at the macroscale by thermodynamics as well as kinetics represents a paradigm shift for biology. There have been high expectations that genetic transformation techniques can lead to the development of microorganisms to produce biofuels directly from cellulose or carbon dioxide and hydrogen. However, despite having invested millions of dollars in development of such organisms, none are available that can produce commercially viable concentrations of the fuels. If an organism is engineered to produce a fuel to a concentration that is not thermodynamically feasible, the organism will need to use energy (e.g. ATP, NADH) captured by some other mechanism to drive the reaction forward. Unless the process conditions make it thermodynamically favorable to make the fuels, organisms that produce the fuels will be disadvantaged compared to mutants or contaminants that use energy more efficiently and grow faster because they produce less of the product. For example, consider the 13 projects in the Electrofuels Program (Conrado et al., 2013) of the US Department of Energy׳s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E). Nine projects were to engineer microorganisms to produce butanol (e.g. n-butanol or iso-butanol), while other projects focused on hydrocarbons or acids. One project (Lan and Liao, 2011) successfully produced about 1% n-butanol, but only when incubated in a medium with high concentrations of H2 and CO2 that made it thermodynamically feasible to produce the butanol. Thermodynamics must be a consideration for process control and isolation of microorganisms to make biofuels whether using natural or genetically-engineered organisms. The second law of thermodynamics has been used in chemical engineering to determine conditions for production of desired chemicals. Biologists consider the thermodynamics of individual steps or pathways within individual organisms because it is well known that each step must be thermodynamically feasible for metabolism through the pathway. Some local steps may only be feasible with the linkage of ATP hydrolysis or other form of energy input (Bar-Even et al., 2012). However, no organism can survive from the energy captured from a pathway that is not thermodynamically feasible at the macroscale (e.g. if more ATP is used than is generated, making the product would be a drain on the organism). The present analysis applies the same concept to more complex systems including biological ecosystems by solving multiple simultaneous equations, and solving the set of equations for multiple sets of conditions. For decades, industrial microorganisms that could use a certain substrate were selected by growing them on the substrate. The present approach makes it possible to establish reaction conditions to select for organisms that produce a desired product, as only organisms producing the product can obtain energy to grow under the calculated process conditions. The approach can also be used to direct the evolution toward organisms that most efficiently make a desired product."
16,Conclusions,"Using calculations of Gibbs energy, the investigators were able to define conditions enabling organisms to grow from the energy of producing alcohols or alkanes, and bacteria were isolated that could make these biofuels under the defined process conditions. The isolated bacteria harbored traits that were not known to exist in bacteria before enabling them to concentrate alcohols or alkanes to levels that are practical for biofuel production."
