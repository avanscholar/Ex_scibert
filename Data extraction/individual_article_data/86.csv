0,Introduction,"Recently, bio-based products derived from renewable biomass have gained increasing attention to replace petroleum-based products. The lignocellulosic biomass is mainly composed of three compounds: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin with variation in composition of each component depending on type of plants [1]. These compounds can be utilized as raw materials of a variety of biochemicals and biofuels. Furfural is a key chemical intermediate in the conversion pathway of hemicellulose to high value-added products such as furfuryl alcohol, methyl furan and various resins [2]. Due to the attractive economic value and wide range of applications, furfuryl alcohol is an important derivative of furfural and produced via hydrogenation process. It can be used as a solvent in pharmaceutical and chemical industries that made vitamin C, lubricants, lysine, plasticizers, dispersing agents, adhesives and thermostatic resins [3,4]. On the industrial scale of furfuryl alcohol production from furfural, the traditional catalyst is Cu-Cr providing 98 % yield of furfuryl alcohol. However, the chromium species can contaminate the target products and impede their further use [5]. Therefore, heterogeneous Cr free catalysts have been developed to overcome these limitations [6]. Noble metal catalysts including Pt, Pd, and Ru have been investigated for the liquid- and gas-phase hydrogenation of furfural. It turned out that they can replace the Cr-containing systems, even though their use increases the cost of the process [7]. Concerning all catalysts studied to date, Cu-based catalysts have been considered as the most promising choice for the selective hydrogenation of furfural as they are highly active and cost effective [1,2,8]. Nagaraja et al. [5] reported that the Cu-MgO catalyst prepared by co-precipitation method showed an excellent activity in hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol with 98 % conversion and > 98 % selectivity. Sitthisa et al. [5,9] compared the hydrogenation activity of Cu, Pd and Ni catalysts, and found that Cu/SiO2 was highly selective to furfuryl alcohol with small amount of 2-methyl furan side-product, while Pd/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts mainly produced furan by decarbonylation and ring opening products (butanal, butanol and butane), respectively. Moreover, most of the researchers reported that the metal oxides, e.g., Ca, Co, Al, Mg, Mo, Fe have been used as a support to improve the activity and product selectivity of Cu-based catalysts by reducing the surface carbonization and the agglomeration of active particles [2,8–11]. It could be considered that Cu-Al catalysts are one of the most promising choices as they are active, selective to desired products, and inexpensive. Moreover, Cu species were reported to highly dispersed on alumina support along with an increase in distributed acidic and basic sites [12]. Nonetheless, the performance of the copper catalysts can be varied depending on the microstructure of the copper and the additives. More importantly, the synthesis conditions needed to be controlled precisely. In the present work, Cu-Al spinel oxide catalysts were proposed for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. The spinel catalyst was prepared by sol-gel combustion technique, and compared to the state-of-the-art Cu/Al2O3 prepared by the conventional impregnation technique in terms of catalytic performances and physicochemical properties. Cu spinel structures were considered as key features to provide excellent catalytic performance in hydrogenation of furfural since hydrogen could occlude in their structure, providing a high performance in hydrogenation reaction [13]. The influences of the reaction temperature, time, H2 initial pressure, and water content on furfural hydrogenation were fully investigated over Cu-Al spinel catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation also suggested that the active copper species and copper-aluminate spinel had strong interaction that helped expedite the hydrogenation reaction. Furthermore, Cu-Al spinel showed high tolerance against water that existed in furfural feedstock, which was normally produced by dehydration of xylose in water media. Therefore, the presented catalytic system could reduce the cost of furfural-water azeotrope separation."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The CuAl2O4 was synthesized by sol−gel combustion and the CuO/Al2O3 was synthesized by the conventional impregnation. The former was prepared by dissolving copper nitrate hemi(pentahydrate) (Cu(NO3)2.2.5H2O) and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3.9H2O) with a molar ratio of 1:2 in deionized water. The mixture was continuously stirred at 60 °C for 2 h. Then, excess amount of citric acid was added into the obtained solution. After continuous stirring for 1 h, the solution was heated up to 100 °C to evaporate water. The temperature of dried precipitate was then raised up to 200 °C until black fine powder was obtained. The solid product was calcined in air at 900 °C for 4 h. For the latter, copper (35 wt. %) was loaded on γ-Al2O3 (specific surface area of 216.3 m2/g). A certain amount of Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O was dissolved in deionized water and then the copper solution was slowly dropped into γ-Al2O3 support under stirring. The mixture was dried at 120 °C for 12 h, and calcined in air at 450 °C for 4 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The crystalline phases of catalysts were investigated by wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD: Bruker D8 ADVANCE) using Cu Kα radiation. The measurement was operated under an electric tension of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA in the 2θ range of 20−80 ° with a step size of 0.02°/s. The textural properties of Cu-based catalysts were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption technique (Quantachrome Instruments, Nova 2000e). Prior to the measurement, the sample was degassed at 300 °C for 3 h. The specific surface area of the catalysts was examined using the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) analysis in a relative pressure (p/p0) range between 0.05 and 0.95, where the specific pore volume was measured at a relative pressure of 0.995. Pore diameters and volumes were calculated using Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BJH) method. The morphology of the catalysts was investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM: JEOL JEM-2100) with the acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by suspending in ethanol and then dispersing on holey carbon-coated grids. The reducibility of catalysts was analyzed using temperature programmed reduction (TPR: CHEMBET-Pulsar Quantachrome Instruments). In each TPR experiment, the catalyst was heated in a flow of gas mixture of hydrogen (H2) and argon (Ar). The experiment was carried out in the temperature range of 45−800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The H2 uptake on the catalysts was investigated by a hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) using ChemStar™ Quantachrome Instruments equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Pior to each measurement, the catalyst was placed in a quartz tube and then reduced with 10 % H2 in Ar at 300 °C for 3 h. After that, the sample was cooled down to room temperature and saturated with H2 for 1 h. A stream of He (30 mL/min) was fed to remove physically adsorbed H2. Subsequently, the measurements were conducted under a He flow in the temperature range of 30−900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. N2O pulse chemisorption was carried out in the flow system to measure the active sites of Cu (Quantachrome, CHEMBET-3000 with mass spectroscopy). Prior to the test, the catalyst was placed in a quartz tube and reduced at 300 °C for 3 h in 10 % H2/Ar. Then, the sample was cooled down to room temperature under a He flow, and 25 % N2O/He were subsequently introduced into a calibrated injection volume of 61 μL using He as a carrier gas. The formation of N2 and consumption of N2O in the effluent were monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and mass spectroscopy. The number of Cu surface atoms was obtained by a stoichiometry between N2O and Cu of 1:2 according to the following equation. (1) 2Cu + N2O → Cu2O + N2 The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed ex-situ and in-situ using a PHI5000 Versa Probe II Scanning XPS Microprobe (ULVAC-PHI) with primary radiation source micro-focused scanning X-ray (Al Kα 1486.6 eV). For in-situ XPS, the sample was reduced in the internal pre-treatment chamber at 300 °C for 3 h under 10% H2/N2 with a flow rate of 40 mL/min. The phase composition of Cu species in the spinel catalyst during reduction process under hydrogen atmosphere at 300 °C for 3 h were investigated by in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (in situ XAS) at Cu K-edges in Transmission mode. Prior to the in situ XAS study, each sample was pelletized with diameter of 1.5 mm (edge jump of 1.4) and placed into the in situ XAS cell [14]. XAS spectra were analyzed by the Athena programs included in the IFEFFIT package. A principal component analysis (PCA) followed by a linear combination fitting (LCF) analysis was applied on the normalized XANES spectra in the −20 eV < E0 < 30 eV range."
4,Performance of Cu-based catalysts on furfural hydrogenation reaction,"2.3 Performance of Cu-based catalysts on furfural hydrogenation reaction The Cu-based catalysts were tested for furfural hydrogenation reaction in a stainless-steel autoclave with a magnetic stirrer. Prior to each experiment, the catalyst was activated by reduction with 10% H2 in N2 at 300 °C for 3 h. After the catalyst activation, 1.5 M of furfural (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) in 2-propanol (Fisher Scientific, 99.98%) and 0.5 g of a pre-reduced catalyst were mixed together. The reaction was carried out at initial H2 pressure of 20−40 bar and temperature of 150−190 °C. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to the ambient temperature with an ice-water bath. Liquid phase product was collected and then centrifuged to remove the solid catalyst. Then the liquid samples were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu) with a flame ionization detector using capillary column (DB-WAX, Agilent technologies). The furfural conversion, furfuryl alcohol yield and turn over frequency (TOF) are calculated using the following equations: (2) Conversion ( % ) = moles of furfural consumed moles of furfural initially charged × 100 (3) Yield % = moles of furfuryl alcohol produced theoretical moles of furfuryl alcohol × 100 (4) T O F ( s − 1 ) = ( moles of f urfural consumed active sites of catalyst x reaction time ) × 1"
5,Computational method,"2.4 Computational method Two catalyst models were constructed for Cu13 cluster on CuAl2O4 and γ-Al2O3. The (311) facet of CuAl2O4 support was selected based on the XRD results (see Fig. 4c) showing that the (311) peak had the highest intensity in the XRD diffraction pattern. The (110) facet of γ-Al2O3, which was reported to be dominant in γ-Al2O3 nanocrystallites (∼70−83% of total area) was applied [15,16]. The possible M13 nanoparticle structures; icosahedral (ICO), face centered cubic (FCC), hexagonal close packed (HCP), capped cubic (CC), buckled biplanar (BBP), triangular biplanar (TBP), and cage-like (CAG), which were reported in previous studies [17,18] were initially investigated. The high-symmetrical Cu13 cluster structure of ICO was found to be the most stable one. Then, the ICO-Cu13 clusters were initially deposited on CuAl2O4 (311) and γ-Al2O3 (110) surfaces at various possible positions and orientations. Here, we report the details of the most stable surface model structures in Fig. S1 and the structures of Cu13/CuAl2O4 (311) and Cu13/γ-Al2O3 (110) surfaces are shown in Fig. S2 in the supplementary information. The structures were applied to study hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. The M13 cluster model can represent approximate 1 nm small particle. It should be noted that catalytic reactivity is also affected by the copper particle size and shape, which may be ascribed to the variation of the number of low coordinated defect sites. In this work, we focused on the effect of the supports on active sites for furfural hydrogenation. The surface models could adequately represent those. Furthermore, the M13 cluster and supported M13 cluster on support such as γ-Al2O3 were broadly applied to study catalytic reaction and catalysts properties, for example NO oxidation, CO oxidation, H2 dissociation, ammonia dissociation and stability of clusters on support [19–25]. The fully periodic plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Program (VASP) [26,27]. Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed with the exchange-correlation functional Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof [28], which was described within the generalized gradient approximation and implemented with the projector augmented wavefunction (PAW) method [29,30] for representing the non-valence core electrons. For the inclusion of long-range dispersion, the semi-empirical dispersion potential correction method described by Grimme and coworkers (DFT-D3) [31,32] was applied. The calculations employed 2 × 2 × 1 k-points Monkhorst-Pack mesh sampling [33] in the surface Brillouin zone. The plane-wave cutoff energy was optimized at 500 eV. The results were checked for convergence with respect to the applied energy cutoff and number of k-points. The Gaussian broadening [34] with a value of smearing parameter σ of 0.05 eV was applied. The convergence criteria for electronic self-consistent iteration were set to 1.0 × 10−6 eV and the ionic relaxation loop was limited for all forces smaller than 0.02 eV/Å for free atoms. The dipole corrections in all three spatial directions were included only in the z direction for surface calculations. The free energy calculations included zero-point energy, enthalpic and entropic corrections at T = 170 °C, the highest yield of furfuryl alcohol was experimentally observed. The transition states were located using Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) [35–37] and Dimer [38–41] methods which were implemented in VTST tool. The transition state structures were characterized by a normal mode analysis to ensure the presence of one imaginary frequency. Bader charge analysis [42–45] was also performed using the method implemented in VTST tool."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of Cu-based catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of Cu-based catalysts The specific surface area, average pore diameter and total pore volume of CuAl2O4 and CuO/Al2O3 catalysts are listed in Table 1 . CuO/Al2O3 catalyst synthesized by impregnation method exhibited the surface area of 123.4 m2/g, average pore diameter of 7.5 nm, and total pore volume of 0.306 cm3/g. It was found that the surface area and total pore volume of CuO/Al2O3 catalyst decreased approximately 1.7 times compared to those of bare Al2O3 support (216 m2/g and 0.610 cm3/g, respectively). The decrease in surface area and pore volume after copper loading might occur from Cu particles blocking and/or entering into the pore of Al2O3 during the impregnation process [46]. However, CuAl2O4 catalyst displayed extremely low surface area (1.8 m2/g) and pore volume (0.020 cm3/g), suggesting its less-porous nature after the high temperature calcination. The above results indicated that the Cu-based catalysts synthesized by different methods exhibited different physical properties, especially specific surface area. TEM micrograph was used to confirm the structure of the catalysts as shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that CuAl2O4 (in Fig. 1a) showed the primary particle size of 10−25 nm, while they tended to agglomerate and be sintered to a larger size of 200–400 nm. The CuO/Al2O3 sample (in Fig. 1b) showed a rod-like structure, which should be mainly alumina particles with length of 10−30 nm. The image showed an agglomeration of a much larger cluster. Note that copper particles were not clearly distinguished in this TEM image. The reduction behavior of catalysts was investigated. Their H2-TPR profiles are shown in Fig. 2 . It was observed that the two-step reduction mechanism proceeded on both catalysts. The low reduction peak at 260−270 °C was attributed to highly dispersed CuO particles or isolated Cu ions on the catalyst surface, whereas the peak at high temperature was attributed to the reduction of bulk CuO or composite metal oxides [2]. Accordingly, CuO/Al2O3 catalyst was reduced at lower temperatures (peaked at 400 °C) compared to CuAl2O4 catalyst (peaked at 520 °C), owing to the low interaction between Cu oxides and Al2O3 support. These results were in good agreement with the stepwise reductions of copper oxide species to Cu°, reported by Pudi et al. [47]. Note that XRD could not clearly detect the CuO phase since its amount was below the XRD detection limit (see Fig. 4c). Although the higher temperature would bring about more complete reduction process to form metallic copper, it was observed that the reduction temperature higher than 300 °C would decrease the activity of catalysts (both CuAl2O4 and CuO/Al2O3), probably due to the sintering effect of copper particles (results not shown). Therefore, the reduction temperature of 300 °C was used for the catalyst activation. The H2-TPD was performed to investigate the adsorption capacity and interaction of hydrogen on the Cu-based catalysts (Fig. 3 ). The H2 uptake data would be useful information since the hydrogenation reaction needed the interaction between H2 molecules and the catalyst surface to proceed. The result showed that CuO/Al2O3 had a broad peak in the range of 150−600 °C, suggesting the low H2 sorption ability. On the other hand, CuAl2O4 clearly showed two major desorption peaks in the range of 90−120 °C and 250−650 °C, indicating the desorption of atomic hydrogen on Cu sites and the desorption of strongly-adsorbed hydrogen on the bulk Cu particles or metal oxide, respectively [48]. The H2 uptake of CuO/Al2O3 and CuAl2O4 catalysts were determined to be 266.9 and 434.5 μmol/g, respectively (in Table 1 ). The spinel CuAl2O4 catalyst showed the higher amount of H2 uptake compared to CuO/Al2O3 catalyst, indicating that atomic hydrogen species could be inserted into the spinel structure. It is expected that the higher amount of H2 uptake would possibly lead to higher hydrogenation reaction rate. The crystalline phases of the Cu-based catalysts were investigated using wide-angle XRD technique as shown in Fig. 4. The spinel catalyst prepared with sol-gel combustion displayed the diffraction patterns at 2θ of 31.3°, 36.9°, 44.8°, 55.7°, 59.4°, and 65.3°, corresponding to reflection planes of cubic spinel CuAl2O4 including (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) (according to the PDF 01-075-4256) [49]. For CuO/Al2O3 catalyst, the diffraction patterns exhibited two phases of γ-Al2O3 at 2θ of 46.5 ° (PDF 00–010-0425) and monoclinic CuO at 2θ of 32.5°, 35.5°, 38.7°, 48.7°, 53.5°, 58.2°, 61.5°, 66.2°, and 68.1°, corresponding to the reflection of (110), (11-1), (111), (20-2), (020), (202), (11-3), (31-1), and (220) (according to the PDF 00-048-1548) [50]. Upon the reduction process at 300 °C for 3 h, the diffraction peak assigned to the metallic copper phase (PDF 00-004-0836) was clearly observed over CuAl2O4, while the structure of spinel CuAl2O4 still remained with lower intensity, apparently due to the incomplete reduction process (Fig. 4c). For CuO/Al2O3 catalyst, CuO was completely reduced to Cu as confirmed by XRD result in Fig. 4d. It should be noted that Cu2+ was more difficult to be reduced in cubic spinel structure of CuAl2O4 catalyst compared to CuO/Al2O3 [7,13,50,51], [23,52], which were consistent with the TPR results. The crystalline phases of the catalysts after the reaction tests will be discussed in the next section. Oxidation state of Cu element was determined by XPS and the results were shown in Fig. 5 . The calcined catalysts presented the principal Cu2p3/2 peak around 925−965 eV and Cu LMM peak around 890−925 eV. In Fig. 5a, the main peaks of CuO/Al2O3 and CuAl2O4 were ca. 933.5 eV, corresponding to Cu2+ species. The satellite peak of Cu2+ species was also observed at 944.1 eV and 963 eV. In Fig. 5b, the Cu LMM spectra of both samples exhibited a single peak at 917.8 eV, which was assignable to a characteristic peak for Cu2+ species [53–56]. In situ XPS measurements after reduction process were carried out to evaluate the surface species of copper. Fig. 5c showed XPS spectra of Cu 2p3/2 and Fig. 5d showed Cu LMM Auger spectra of the reduced catalysts. The characteristics of copper species are listed in the Table 2 . Accordingly, the Cu 2p3/2 spectra of CuAl2O4 shifted the peak maxima from 933.5 to 932.8 eV, indicating the surface changed from Cu2+-rich to Cu0/Cu1+- rich surfaces. In addition, Cu LMM spectra confirmed the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu1+ and Cu0 species. It seemed that Cu1+ and Cu0 species were reduced copper species while Cu2+ was the unreduced spinel matrix. In addition, the satellite peak of CuO/Al2O3 was not detectable after the reduction process due to the fact that the divalent copper species was completely reduced to zero valent copper (Cu0) on the surface as confirmed by the Cu2p3/2 and Cu LMM in Fig. 5c and d. The in situ XAS measurement was performed to further identify the oxidation state and composition of Cu species in the reduced Cu-based catalysts. The LCF analysis, showing the spectra of Cu°, Cu1+ and Cu2+ species are displayed in Fig. 6 . The data are tabulated in Table 3 with R factor and Reduced R2 < 0.015 (also see Table S1). Normally, the edge position of Cu° is located at 8979 eV while Cu+1 and Cu+2 are located at 8980. 5 eV and 8983.7 eV, respectively [14,57]. After the reduction process, Cu° species were generated and become a pre-dominant phase for both catalyst samples. The reduced CuAl2O4 catalyst had Cu° species of 37.3% and Cu2+ species of 62.7%, while the reduced CuO/Al2O3 had Cu° species of 70.1% and Cu2+ species of 21.9%. Clearly, CuO was easily reduced to metallic copper than Cu-Al spinel which is in good agreement with H2-TPR and XRD data. Nonetheless, Cu1+ species in the CuAl2O4 sample was not observed by XAS bulk analysis, although it appeared in the XPS spectra of the corresponding surface. N2O pulse chemisorption technique was used to investigate the active sites of catalysts, which referred to copper metallic phase. As summarized in Table 3, the amount of active copper sites of CuO/Al2O3 catalyst were determined as 12.4 μmol/g, which were 1.4 times higher than CuAl2O4 catalyst (8.7 μmol/g), which is consistent well with the XRD, XPS and XAS results. Despite the lower amount of active site, CuAl2O4 catalyst exhibited greater activity than CuO/Al2O3, suggesting the higher catalytic activity of the active site in the spinel environment."
8,Catalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts in furfural hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts in furfural hydrogenation Fig. 7 shows the catalytic performance of CuAl2O4 in furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol as a function of temperature and time. In Fig. 7a, furfural conversion and furfuryl alcohol yield increased with respect to the increment of reaction temperature, suggesting its endothermic nature. The reaction temperature above 170 °C gave a similar yield above 95%. In Fig. 7b, furfural conversion and furfuryl alcohol yield increased monotonously with increasing reaction time. The conversion and yield were achieved at 99.3% and 96.2%, respectively, within 60 min. The selectivity toward furfuryl alcohol was extremely high for all cases signifying that the side reactions were not flavored over the spinel catalysts. The small amounts of by-products including 2-methyl furan (2 M F) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) were detected (< 2%), as the reaction mechanisms of by-products formation were reported by Nagaraja et al. [8]. Next, the effect of initial hydrogen pressure (20, 30, and 40 bars) on furfural hydrogenation was studied at temperature of 170 °C and time of 60 min (Fig. 8 ). It was found that increasing H2 pressure from 20 to 30 bar would enhance the conversion and yield. However, the furfuryl alcohol yield slightly dropped when H2 pressure was further increased to 40 bar, presumably due to the over-hydrogenation reaction. In addition, the reaction rate could be enhanced by increasing total pressure from 20 (pure H2) to 40 bar (H2:N2 at 1:1). However, the activity from the mixed gas system was not as high as that from the pure H2 system. The results suggested that the conversion and yield could be enhanced by increasing total pressure or partial hydrogen pressure, likely due to the improved solubility of hydrogen in the liquid phase. It is essential to investigate effects of water content on the furfural hydrogenation since water is basically used as a solvent in xylose dehydration to furfural. It is hard to remove all water from furfural by a conventional distillation process because they are azeotrope. In this section, the results of catalytic hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol at various water contents in a range of 0–30% v/v of 1.5 M of furfural solution were reported. Moreover, the reaction was tested on CuO/Al2O3 for performance comparison (Fig. 9 ). Without water, CuAl2O4 catalyst showed complete conversion with furfuryl alcohol yield of 98.6%, which were much higher than that of CuO/Al2O3. The higher water content typically resulted in lower conversion and yield. The yield decreased to 94.3, 79.3 and 23.6% with the water contents of 10, 20, and 30% v/v, respectively. However, the more severe decline in activity was observed on CuO/Al2O3 when the water content was increased. As seen in Fig. 9b, the furfural yields drastically dropped to 57.7, and 11.7% at water content of 20, and 30% v/v, respectively. The result suggested that the higher content of water led to more side reactions. In addition, water would bring about catalyst deactivation as oxidation of copper was confirmed by XRD analysis. The spent CuAl2O4 and CuO/Al2O3 catalysts in the reaction with water addition demonstrated the XRD characteristics of Cu2O phase (Fig. 4). It was observed that the reduced CuAl2O4 was more stable than the reduced CuO/Al2O3 at all water contents. The suggested condition of furfural solution should not contain more than 10% v/v of water to achieve complete furfural conversion and furfuryl alcohol yield at or above 94%. The turn over frequency (TOF) of Cu-based catalysts was calculated based on the amount of copper active sites measured by N2O chemisorption. It was found that the TOF of CuAl2O4 catalyst was 1.4 times higher than that of CuO/Al2O3 one. The results signified that furfuryl alcohol preferred to form on the CuAl2O4 catalyst even though it had lower amount of active sites. Accordingly, it was considered that the reduced copper species dispersed in Cu-Al spinel structure along with the high H2 sorption ability in CuAl2O4 catalyst played a positive role in the hydrogenation reaction. In spite of the low surface area and pore volume, CuAl2O4 exhibited higher activity than CuO/Al2O3. Upon the H2 activation process, metallic copper species along with mildly-oxidized copper or Cu2+ ions were formed on the CuAl2O4 spinel host, and the interaction between them was anticipated to correlate to the excellent catalytic activity. In addition, it was previously reported that the Cu2+ ion incorporated in octahedral sites of Al2O3 or vicariant in aluminate could catalyze the H2 dissociation and acts as an adsorptive site for dissociated H2 molecule, leading to the high catalytic activity in the hydrogenation reaction [58]. According to XRD results of the spent catalysts (Fig. 4), metallic copper species on cubic spinel structure (CuAl2O4) remained quite stable, suggesting that these copper particles were more stable than those in the CuO impregnated on γ-Al2O3. It is worth noting that the surface of the reduced CuAl2O4 possessed more Cu1+ surface species than that of the reduced CuO/Al2O3, although the role of Cu1+ species in the hydrogenation reaction was not clear in the present study. As summarized in Table 4 , the spinel catalyst presented in this work showed high furfural yield (95–99%), which was best among the catalysts reported so far in the literature (furfural yield of 50−98%). We also proved for the first time that the developed spinel catalyst would provide the high tolerance against water in the liquid-phase hydrogenation reaction. In addition, the stability and reusability of the spinel catalyst were investigated as shown in Fig. 10 . The gradual decrease in furfural yield was observed from the first cycle to the third cycle (ca. 25% drop), although the conversion remained almost constant. This is likely due to carbon deposition since the elemental analysis confirmed that carbon (4−5 wt.%) was formed on the catalyst surface. By simple air calcination at 900 °C for 4 h, the catalytic performance of the regenerated catalyst was comparable to the fresh one (furfural conversion of 97.1 % and furfuryl alcohol yield of 91.6%). It was previously reported that the CuAl2O4 catalysts could be rapidly deactivated by coke deposition and the degraded catalyst could be regenerated by burning off at high temperature [7]. The DFT calculations on the two catalytic systems including Cu/CuAl2O4 and Cu/γ-Al2O3 were also carried out and discussed in the next section."
9,"Furfural, furfuryl alcohol, hydrogen adsorption and furfural hydrogenation reaction mechanism","3.3 Furfural, furfuryl alcohol, hydrogen adsorption and furfural hydrogenation reaction mechanism In this section, DFT calculations were performed to investigate catalytic active sites, interaction between key species and catalyst surfaces, and furfural hydrogenation mechanisms on Cu13/CuAl2O4 (311) and Cu13/γ-Al2O3 (110) catalysts in order to obtain physical insight into different catalytic reactivity observed experimentally. The adsorption energy was used as a preliminary probe of interaction strength between adsorbates and surfaces. The adsorption energy ( E ad ) was calculated by (5) E a d = E t o t a l - E c l e a n s u r f a c e - E a d s o r b a t e ( i s o l a t e d ) where E t o t a l is the energy of the adsorption structure, E c l e a n s u r f a c e is the energy of the clean surface structure, and E a d s o r b a t e ( i s o l a t e d ) is the energy of isolated adsorbate molecule. The more negative value of E a d indicates the stronger adsorption. Furfural and furfuryl alcohol adsorption were initially located at three sites; (i) at Cu site (ii) at Al site and (iii) at the interface Cu-Al site. H2 and 2H dissociative adsorption was also investigated at three sites of (i) Cu site (ii) O site and (iii) the interface of Cu-O site. Here, we reported only the most stable adsorption structures which are shown in Figs. S3 and S4 in supporting information and the adsorption energies are summarized in Table 5 . Cu13/CuAl2O4 (311) adsorbed furfural, furfuryl alcohol, H2, and dissociative 2H significantly stronger than Cu13/γ-Al2O3 (110) catalyst. Oxygen of furfural and furfuryl alcohol bound to both catalysts at Al sites adjacent to Cu cluster where their carbon atoms also interacted with Cu cluster (see Figs. S3 and S4 in supporting information). Therefore, the interface site between Al site of support and Cu cluster was important for furfural hydrogenation. Furthermore, the atomic partial charge from a Bader analysis of the Cu atom that involved in furfural and furfuryl alcohol adsorption on Cu13/CuAl2O4 and on Cu13/γ-Al2O3 were +0.06 and −0.05, respectively. This indicated the different Cu oxidation states at the active site on the two catalysts. Thus, the calculation results added a support that the active Cu site on Cu13/CuAl2O4 could be at the higher oxidation state than that on Cu13/γ-Al2O3. We noted that the charge associated with the Cu atom was delocalized from the Cu center, and so the Bader charge on Cu could only provide the relative and not the absolute value of the Cu charge state as Cu°, Cu+1 or Cu2+ [41–43,56,59]. Interestingly, the favorable sites for H2 dissociation were different, yet the energy barriers of H2 dissociation on both catalysts were comparable (see Table 5). The Cu13 cluster acted as an active site for H2 dissociation on Cu13/γ-Al2O3 (110) while O sites were the active sites for H2 dissociation on Cu13/CuAl2O4 (311). The larger amount of H2 desorption observed in the experiment (see Table 1) on CuAl2O4 could be ascribed to the higher amount of O sites on CuAl2O4 for H2 adsorption and H2 dissociation compared to amount of Cu sites on Cu/γ-Al2O3. The amount of H2 on Cu13/γ-Al2O3 (110) catalyst might be more dependent on Cu cluster dispersion due to Cu was the active site for H2 adsorption and dissociation. In addition, Bader charge analysis showed the distinct characteristic of the supported Cu13 cluster that it lost electrons to γ-Al2O3 support whereas it gained an electron from CuAl2O4 (see Table 5). Table 5 summarized the Bader charge analysis of supported Cu13 cluster on Cu13/CuAl2O4 (311) and Cu13/γ-Al2O3 (110), the most stable adsorption energies of furfural, furfuryl alcohol, H2 molecule and 2H atoms upon H2 dissociation, energy barriers and reaction free energies of H2 dissociation and the most favorable furfural hydrogenation pathways on Cu13/CuAl2O4 (311) and Cu13/γ-Al2O3(110). The corresponding adsorption structures and transition state structures are shown in Fig. S3–S5 in supplementary information. Furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol reaction mechanism was investigated using DFT calculations to determine reaction free energies and energy barriers on Cu13/CuAl2O4 (311) and Cu13/γ-Al2O3 (110). Furfural molecule and dissociative H2 firstly adsorbed on catalyst surface, then two hydrogen atom addition steps were required. The two H addition steps occurred at carbon atom and O atom as illustrated in Fig. 11 a. The free energy diagrams of the most favorable pathway on the catalysts were shown in Fig. 11b. The first H addition was favorable to occur at carbon atom on Cu13/CuAl2O4 (311), however it was favorable to take place at O atom on Cu13/γ-Al2O3 (110). The reaction free energies were −3.40 and −2.47 eV and the highest energy barriers were 0.58 and 1.02 eV on Cu13/CuAl2O4(311) and Cu13/γ-Al2O3(110), respectively (see Table 5). Thus, furfural hydrogenation was more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable on Cu13/CuAl2O4 (311) surface. Overall, the DFT results suggested that catalytic activity increase of furfural hydrogenation on Cu/CuAl2O4 compared to Cu/Al2O3 catalysts could significantly be contributed by the following factors: (i) the stronger interaction with furfural and furfuryl alcohol, (ii) the higher amount of active sites for H2 dissociation and (iii) the lower reaction free energy and energy barriers for hydrogenation."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, the spinel CuAl2O4 was proposed as a catalyst for liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Compared to the impregnated CuO/Al2O3 and other reported non-noble metal catalysts, the CuAl2O4 showed excellent performance in term of conversion, yield, selectivity and stability. The reaction temperature, time, and H2 initial pressure strongly affected the conversion and yield of the product. The yield over CuAl2O4 could be maximized to 98–99%. The spinel structure and high hydrogen uptake of CuAl2O4 correlated well with the high catalytic performance. DFT calculations revealed that the spinel catalyst would provide active sites for H2 dissociation and strong interaction with furfural/furfuryl alcohol. As a result, the lower reaction free energy and energy barriers were found on the hydrogenation over the spinel system."
