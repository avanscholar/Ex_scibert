0,Introduction,"Since the groundbreaking discoveries on gold (Au) catalysis by Hutchings et al. [1–3], Au-catalyzed chemoselective hydrogenation as one of major applications of Au catalysis has attracted tremendous interests. Achieving high yield of unsaturated alcohol (UOL) in chemoselective mono-hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde (UAL) remained as a great challenge because the hydrogenation of CC bond was more thermodynamically favorable than CO bond by ∼35kJ/mol. In addition, from an industrial point of view, robust catalysts with excellent stability for long-term operation in continuous flow-mode were highly desired. Exploring catalytic mechanisms, especially the nature of catalytic sites and the activation modes of reactants, was helpful for designing and developing novel and efficient catalysts. The most intensively studied Pt-based catalyst has shed some light on understanding UAL hydrogenation. Unsupported monometallic Pt powders yielded mainly saturated aldehyde (SAL) due to the thermodynamically favored hydrogenation of the CC over the CO bond [4]. Various methodologies such as supporting Pt onto reducible carriers (CeO2, TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, etc.) to establish strong support-metal interaction or alloying Pt with more electropositive metals (Fe, Sn, etc.) were successful in promoting UOL selectivity [5–12]. Generally, the adsorption mode and strength of UAL molecule on catalytic active sites, which greatly changed as the electronic character or surface morphology of Pt-based catalysts was regulated, were employed as the keys to interpret product distribution, i.e., surface adsorption of CO bond favored UOL formation and that of CC bond led to SAL product [12–16]. Nonetheless, the nature of preferential adsorption and the activation of CO bond over catalytic sites remained ambiguous. Vannice et al. proposed that metal-support interfacial sites were able to polarize the CO bond of crotonaldehyde (CRAL) and subsequently hydrogenate it on Pt/TiO2 [4]. Studies on Pt/ZnO, PtZnCl2/SiO2 and PtCr/ZnO reported the inhibited CC hydrogenation due to the electron donation from Zn to Pt via alloying, and chlorine-reinforced Lewis acidity on the first two catalysts was also proposed to favor the binding of terminal oxygen of CO bond [17–19]. Whereas, the epitaxial Pt (111) layer on CeO2 instead of PtCeO x interfacial sites or CePt sites was suggested to be the catalytic sites for the hydrogenation of CO bond leading to the improved crotonyl alcohol (CROL) selectivity [5]. Comparative study over Pt/TiO2 and Pt/SiO2 by Lercher’s group concluded that either large Pt particles with high fraction of Pt (111) surfaces or TiO x decorated Pt active sites were responsible for the enhanced selectivity toward CROL [20]. Au/TiO2, Au/ZnO, Au/ZrO2, Au/Mg x AlO, Au/Fe3O4, Au/FeO x /Al2O3, Au/CeO2, AuIn/ZnO, etc. have been reported as active catalysts for UAL hydrogenation to UOL [21–27]. Different from the favorable dissociative activation of dihydrogen on Pt, Au atoms on clean gold surface barely chemisorbed and dissociated dihydrogen. Thus, the activation of both UAL molecule and dihydrogen has to be investigated prior to the rational interpretation on the mechanism of Au-catalyzed UAL hydrogenation. The perimeter-interface mechanism, firstly proposed for gold-catalyzed oxidation of carbon monoxide by Bond and coworkers [28], was adopted to explain UAL chemoselective hydrogenation on Au catalysts. Hutchings et al. reported that Au/ZnO and Au/ZrO2 doped by thiophene surprisingly improved the formation rate of CROL because of the enhanced ability to activate CO bond over interfacial sites electronically modified by sulfur [24]. Differently, the perimeter interfaces on Au/TiO2 were suggested to be active sites for dissociative activation of dihydrogen [29]. A detailed theoretical study further predicted that the synergy between Au clusters and low coordinated oxygen atoms on TiO2 surface promoted the dissociation of dihydrogen [30]. The edge and corner sites of Au particles were also suggested to be active for activating CO bond and dissociating dihydrogen. A study on AuIn/ZnO by Claus et al. found that decoration of indium preferentially covered the outer facets of Au particles and the AuZnO interfaces but left the edges uncovered. Consequently, the enhanced CO hydrogenation by indium decoration suggested that the edges of crystalline Au particles, instead of interfacial sites, were the active sites for the preferred CO hydrogenation [26]. Boccuzzi et al. proposed that the dissociation of dihydrogen occurred on the edge and corner sites of Au particles due to the formation of AuH and AuOH species in their FTIR studies [31]. Ag catalysts were also reported to selectively hydrogenate the CO group of UAL. Sol–gel method derived monometallic Ag/SiO2 catalyst favored the hydrogenation of the CO group of CRAL in gas phase with a CROL selectivity up to 63% [32]. Further modification on Ag/SiO2 catalysts by alloying with cadmium or adding manganese or lanthanum significantly increased the CROL selectivity to ∼85% [32]. In citral hydrogenation, Ag/SiO2 catalysts synthesized from silver nitrate or silver 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy] acetate exhibited high UOL selectivity (71–77%) at conversion of 50% [33]. In acrolein hydrogenation, the oxygen pre-treated Ag/SiO2 catalysts increased not only the overall hydrogenation activity but also the selectivity toward allyl alcohol. A density functional study suggested that the surface Ag (111) with sub-surface oxygen centers favored the formation of allyl alcohol but clean Ag (110) surface afforded propyl aldehyde as the main product [34]. Over a AgIn catalyst, remarkably high selectivity of 75% toward allyl alcohol was observed at high acrolein conversion of 70% [35,36]. The activation of dihydrogen on Ag-based catalysts was also a key step in UAL hydrogenation. It was reported that over supported and unsupported silver catalysts, both silica and silver were found to be able to dissociate dihydrogen [37]. Severe deactivation of noble metal catalysts in vapor-phase hydrogenation of UAL was frequently observed and remained as a great barrier hindering the industrial application. Au/CeO2 and several Pt-based catalysts underwent rapid deactivation during the first several hour reaction on stream and then stepped into the steady state with relatively slow deactivation rate [4,6,20,38]. Metal sintering was rarely taken into account since the reaction temperature for UAL hydrogenation was relatively low. Surface deposits and poisoning of active sites were assumed to be the primary reasons responsible for catalyst deactivation [20,39]. To date, a variety of bimetallic AuAg catalysts have been synthesized and displayed excellent performances for CO oxidation [40], ester hydrogenation [41], etc. The combination of Au and Ag has been reported to bring about some positive effects including the following: (1) creating nano-sized and sintering-resistant bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) [42]; (2) enhancing the interaction with oxygen due to the higher affinity of Ag toward oxygen than Au [43]; and (3) promoting low-temperature activity [41]. Literatures on Au or Ag-based catalysts for UAL hydrogenation occasionally emerged [44,45], whereas, to the best of our knowledge, bimetallic catalyst containing both Au and Ag has not been applied in this field yet. In the present work, the bimetallic AuAg NPs stabilized on SBA-15 surfaces via a two-step preparation method were applied in vapor-phase hydrogenation of CRAL, not only aiming to expand application of AuAg/SBA-15 but also intending to explore catalytic nature on a new model reaction. Decorating Ag on Au significantly influenced the catalytic performances in CRAL hydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity and stability. Investigations on the effect of reaction parameters and catalyst characterization have been conducted to probe the dynamics and mechanism of catalytic hydrogenation of CRAL. In particular, the adsorption behavior of CRAL molecule on catalyst surface was investigated using in situ FT-IR technique."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The preparation of mesoporous SBA-15 (specific surface area of ∼830m2/g, average pore diameter of 5.6nm) and the surface functionalization of SBA-15 with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma–Aldrich) were conducted following the procedures described in literatures [42,46]. A two-step deposition–reduction method was employed to prepare bimetallic Au–Ag/SBA-15 catalysts. A required amount of 0.0025molL−1 HAuCl4 solution, 50mL of deionized water, and 1.0g of APTES-functionalized SBA-15 were mixed; 20mL of 0.066molL−1 NaBH4 solution was then added dropwise under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The solid product was filtered, washed with adequate deionized water and denoted as Au/SBA-15. Subsequently, a required amount of 0.0012molL−1 AgNO3 solution was dropped into a beaker containing Au/SBA-15 powders, followed by adding 20mL of 0.066molL−1 NaBH4 solution dropwise under vigorous stirring. After aging, filtrating and washing with deionized water, the obtained powders were dried at 383K overnight and then calcined at 823K in air for 6h to completely remove residual APTES. The yielded catalyst was then labeled as xAuyAg/SBA-15, where x and y denoted the loadings of Au and Ag in weight, respectively. For comparison, two monometallic catalysts, 8Au/SBA-15 and 4.5Ag/SBA-15, were also prepared by strictly following the deposition–reduction method described above. In addition, another Ag catalyst on SBA-15 with an Ag loading of 4.5wt% was synthesized by a volumetric impregnation method (denoted as 4.5Ag/SBA-15-IMP). Briefly, 3mL of 0.145molL−1 AgNO3 solution was introduced into a flask containing 1.0g of SBA-15 without surface functionalization and the mixture was then aged at room temperature for 10h under stirring. After filtrating and washing with deionized water, the collected powders were dried at 383K overnight and calcined at 623K for 4h in air."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The actual Au and Ag loadings were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on a Thermo Elemental IRIS Intrepid II XSP apparatus. Specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter were measured by static N2 physisorption method at 77.3K on a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 surface area and pore analyzer. All samples were outgassed at 393K for 1h and then evacuated at 573K for 3h to remove physically adsorbed impurities prior to the N2 physisorption measurements. The specific surface areas were calculated using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the average pore diameter and pore size distribution were derived from the desorption branch of isotherm using Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. TEM images were collected on a FEI Tecnai 30 electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 300kV. Prior to the TEM measurements, catalyst powders were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol for 30min and a drop of the obtained solution was trickled on the copper grid. Measurements of XRD patterns were conducted on a PANalytical X’pert Pro Super X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15418nm) with a scanning angle (2θ) range of 10–90°, tube voltage of 40kV and current of 30mA. The full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of XRD peak at 2θ =38.2° for Au (111) or Ag (111) was employed to calculate the size of metal NPs with Scherrer equation using JADE software (MDI JADE 7 Materials Data XRD Pattern Processing, Identification and Quantification). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was carried out on a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprob spectrometer (Physical Electronics) equipped with a Al Kα X-ray radiation source (hν =1486.6eV). A flood gun with variable electron voltage (from 6 to 8eV) was set for charge compensation. The raw data were calibrated with the data for the binding energy (BE) of Si2p peak (103.4eV) from XPS handbook. The concentration of each element was calculated from the area of the corresponding peak and calibrated with the sensitivity factor of Wagner. In situ FT-IR study of CRAL adsorption on catalysts was performed on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer at a spectral resolution of 4cm−1. Briefly, 30mg of catalyst sample was grinded and compressed into a self-supporting wafer in a diameter of 10mm and carefully loaded into a stainless steel cell with CaF2 windows. The pretreatment of catalyst wafer reduction was conducted in a flow of H2/Ar=1/19 (50mLmin−1) at 623K for 4h and then an 30min evacuation at same temperature was performed with the purpose to completely remove chemisorbed hydrogen species. Background spectra were collected as references at different temperatures while cooling the cell to room temperature under evacuation. At room temperature, an appropriate amount of CRAL vapor diffused into the cell in vacuum state and contacted with the catalyst wafer, when a switching valve connecting the cell and a glass tube containing purified CRAL liquid was opened carefully. A series of IR spectra at different evacuation times and temperatures were collected and referenced to the background spectrum collected at the same operating temperature. Analogously, the FT-IR studies on the adsorption of dihydrogen and surface reaction between adsorbed CRAL species and dihydrogen were carried out by introducing high-purity dihydrogen into the cell at a timely moment."
4,Catalytic measurements,"2.3 Catalytic measurements The kinetics of vapor-phase CRAL hydrogenation was studied in a fixed-bed micro-reactor in a continuous down-flow mode under differential conditions. Briefly, 200mg of catalyst (40–60 mesh) was loaded into a stainless steel tubular reactor (internal diameter=7mm) and the top side of catalyst bed was packed with quartz grains (height=80mm). The catalyst was activated in a flow of H2/Ar=1/19 (50mLmin−1) at 623K for 4h and then cooled to the reaction temperature (usually 393K). High-purity dihydrogen was fed into the reactor by a mass flow controller and the reactor pressure was precisely controlled by a back-pressure regulator. The pure CRAL liquid was pumped into the reactor with a digital HPLC pump (SSI series III, Scientific Systems). The outlet stream was sampled using an automatic 6-ports valve sampling system (Vici Valco) and analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu) with a flame ionization detector and a DB-Wax capillary column at 16min intervals. In the activation energy measurement, 200mg of catalyst (40–60 mesh) was diluted with quartz grains to minimize the heat transfer effect. The catalytic performances under different temperatures were then evaluated under quasi-steady state of CRAL hydrogenation. To eliminate the mass transfer effect, low CRAL conversions no higher than 30% were regulated by controlling the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of CRAL. The turnover frequency (TOF) was the activity normalized to the number of Au and/or Ag surface atoms based on the measured metallic dispersion by TEM observation. The metal dispersion is calculated according to a method described in literature [47] using the following equation: (1) D m = 6 M w ρ N 0 a M d ¯ V A where Dm is the metal dispersion, Mw is the molecular weight, ρ is the absolute density of bulk metal (ρAu =19.32g/ml and ρAg =10.53g/ml), No is Avogadro constant, aM is the surface concentration of metal (1.15E+19atom/m2 for Au or Ag), and dv is the average metal particle diameter determined by TEM. In addition, cyclohexene hydrogenation was also investigated under the conditions of 423K and ambient pressure. Cyclohexene vapor was fed into fixed-bed micro-reactor by pure dihydrogen flow with a bubbler soaked in 293K water bath. The outlet stream was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu) with a flame ionization detector and a HP-5 capillary column. Cyclohexane was the only product and other side products were below the detection limitation."

6,Catalytic performances of CRAL and cyclohexene hydrogenation,"3.1 Catalytic performances of CRAL and cyclohexene hydrogenation Under conventional reaction conditions, ambient pressure and moderate reaction temperature (323–393K), SBA-15 supported Au, Ag or AuAg catalysts show poor catalytic activities in CRAL hydrogenation as compared to some reported Pt-based catalysts [6,17]. It is likely due to that chemisorption and activation of dihydrogen on Ag and Au that have fully filled d-band and low affinity toward hydrogen are weak compared to Pt, Pd, and Ni. Escalating reaction pressure to 30bar significantly increases the hydrogenation rate, indicating that high hydrogen surface coverage under high dihydrogen partial pressure is beneficial. Several monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were tested at reaction pressure of 30bar and the results are listed in Table 1 . Similar to the results reported on some Pt-based and Au/CeO2 catalysts, the vapor-phase CRAL hydrogenation over SBA-15 supported Au and Ag catalyst undergoes two reaction stages: initial transient state and quasi-steady state [6,20,38]. The initial transient stage, in which catalysts display high CRAL hydrogenation activity but deactivate quickly, usually lasts for no longer than 120min. Following the initial transient stage, CRAL hydrogenation gradually steps into a quasi-steady state, in which catalytic performance is relatively stable and the rate of catalyst deactivation is remarkably slower than in initial transient stage. Monometallic catalysts, 8Au/SBA-15, 4.5Ag/SBA-15 and 4.5Ag/SBA-15-IMP show poor catalytic performances in both initial transient and quasi-steady stages. Over these catalysts, the CO hydrogenation outperforms over the CC hydrogenation, especially in the initial transient stage. Introducing Ag into Au/SBA-15 catalyst affords significantly promoted hydrogenation performances. The CRAL conversions in quasi-steady state on bimetallic AuAg catalysts with Ag loading in the range of 0.5–4.5wt% are at least 3.7 times higher than that of 8Au/SBA-15 catalyst. The Ag loading in bimetallic catalyst affects the catalytic results with a volcano-type curve and the highest CRAL conversion is observed on the 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst, which is also the most active catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate in our previous study [38]. Under reaction conditions of 393K, 30bar, and H2/CRAL ratio of 50, the 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst shows a CROL selectivity of 61.9% with 75.0% conversion at a high CRAL LSHV (3.55gg-cat−1 h−1). This CRAL LSHV is remarkably high as compared to those in previous reports on vapor-phase CRAL hydrogenation [17,38]. Although Ag has been proved to be active for UAL hydrogenation [44,45], the observed promoting effect of Ag on Au/SBA-15 cannot be simply ascribed to the increased amount of active metal per gram catalyst because greatly improved catalytic performance is observed on the 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with an Ag loading as low as 0.5wt% (Table 1). It is notable that pure SBA-15 support is also catalytically active for CRAL hydrogenation with saturated aldehyde (BUAL) as a main product, although the CRAL conversion does not exceed 1%. In addition, due to the complication of CRAL hydrogenation and possible dependence of product selectivity on CRAL conversion, catalytic performances of different catalysts are also compared (Table S1) at comparable and relatively low CRAL conversions. Similar to the results at high conversions, the 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 and 8Au0.75Ag/SBA-15 catalysts with low Ag loading exhibit better CRAL selectivity than other catalysts. The selectivity of deep hydrogenation product (BUOL) under relatively low level of CRAL conversion (19.1–29.4%) on monometallic or bimetallic catalysts is all lower than at higher CRAL conversion. Fig. 1 shows the hydrogenation activity toward CO and CC bonds (ACO and ACC) in both initial transient and quasi-steady stages. Over monometallic 8Au/SBA-15 and 4.5Ag/SBA-15 catalysts synthesized with deposition–reduction method, the ACO is higher than the ACC in initial transient stage. Both ACO and ACC decrease significantly prior to the quasi-steady state. In particular, the decline of ACO is severer than that of ACC, implying that the adverse changes on catalyst bring about more negative effects to the hydrogenation of CO bond than that of CC bond. Over the bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts, the hydrogenation of CO bond remarkably outperforms than that of CC bond in both initial transient and quasi-steady stages (Fig. 1). In the initial transient stage, the Ag content (0.5–4.5wt%) only slightly influences the ACO but has significant effect on ACC. Highest ACC appears on the 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst. Under the quasi-steady state, drastically reduced ACO and ACC are observed on bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts. The 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 is the most active catalyst for the hydrogenation of CC bond, the same as in the initial transient stage. Differently, the 8Au4.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst, which displays the highest ACO in initial transient stage, affords the poorest CO bond hydrogenation among all bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts. Arrhenius plots for monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 and the apparent activation energies (Ea ) based on CRAL consumption are also listed. The Ea for Au/SBA-15 is slightly higher than that for Ag/SBA-15. Remarkably, bimetallic catalysts show lower Ea than monometallic catalysts. The lowest Ea appears on 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 with a moderate Ag content. Catalytic performance of CRAL hydrogenation is significantly affected by reaction parameters including reaction pressure, hydrogen/CRAL ratio and reactant space velocity. Catalytic activities as a function of these reaction factors over the 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst are listed in Table 2 . Increasing hydrogen partial pressure and hydrogen/CRAL ratio is beneficial to promote CRAL hydrogenation rate, probably due to the high hydrogen surface coverage under high partial pressure, which promotes the formation and supply of active hydrogen species. Decreasing the hydrogen/CRAL ratio is found to considerably slow down the hydrogenation rate while the reaction pressure and CRAL LHSV are maintained at 30bar and 7gg-cat−1 h−1, respectively. The decrease of the hydrogen/CRAL ratio from 50 to 20 only slightly decreases the partial pressure of hydrogen from 29.4 to 28.6bar, nonetheless, results in greatly slowed hydrogenation rate, implying that the surface adsorption and activation of hydrogen is not only determined by the hydrogen partial pressure, but also dependent on the surface adsorption competition with CRAL. In other words, increasing the partial pressure of CRAL leads to the weakening of hydrogen surface adsorption possibility and subsequently reduces the hydrogenation rate. The distributions of reaction products under different partial pressure and space velocity of reactants provide useful information to understand the catalytic mechanism of CRAL hydrogenation (Table 2). With the increase of reaction pressure, the selectivity toward CROL, which is the desired product from CO hydrogenation, is improved along with the enhanced CRAL conversion. Under constant reaction pressure and hydrogen/CRAL ratio (30bar and 50, respectively), increasing the CRAL LHSV from 3.55 to 7gg-cat−1 h−1 results in the decrease in CRAL conversion yet slightly affects the selectivity toward CROL. When reducing the hydrogen/CRAL ratio from 50 to 20, the selectivity of CROL and the CRAL conversion both remarkably decrease but the selectivity toward BUAL (CC bond hydrogenated product) increases. In conclusion, those adjustments on reaction parameters favorable to increase surface hydrogen coverage may not only promote the rate of CRAL hydrogenation but also increase the selectivity of product from CO bond hydrogenation. The 8Au0.75Ag/SBA-15 catalyst is robust and stable to endure long-term catalytic operation (Fig. 3 ). Under a mild temperature of 393K, the 8Au0.75Ag/SBA-15 catalyst deactivates sharply in the first 120min and then displays relatively steady catalytic performance for at least 1380min. The attempts to regenerate the partially deactivated 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst by re-calcination (773K in air for 2h) and re-reduction (623K in hydrogen for 4h) cannot completely restore the catalytic activity. The presence of both irreversible and reversible deactivation probably implies that both blocking of active sites and irreversible transformation of catalyst microstructure take place simultaneously in the process of CRAL hydrogenation. In order to clarify the difference between CC and CO bond hydrogenation, catalytic hydrogenation of cyclohexene is investigated over monometallic and bimetallic catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . Under ambient pressure and 423K, monometallic Au/SBA-15 and bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 are active in catalyzing cyclohexene hydrogenation to cyclohexane with relatively low activities. However, the Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/SBA-15-IMP synthesized from different methods are almost inactive for cyclohexene hydrogenation. This result is in line with earlier study on alkene hydrogenation over Ag/SiO2 and Ag/TiO2 catalysts [48], in which the authors ascribed the poor activity to the rather weak complexation of alkenes on Ag sites and not of the inability of Ag to dissociate hydrogen. The monometallic Ag/SBA-15 shows remarkably lower cyclohexene hydrogenation activity than Au/SBA-15, yet their difference in CRAL hydrogenation is not so remarkable. Introducing a small amount of Ag into Au/SBA-15 catalyst brings about positive effect to cyclohexene hydrogenation activity. The activity of 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with the Au/Ag molar ratio of 9 is about 1.3 times higher than that of 8Au/SBA-15. However, further increasing Ag loading leads to the decrease of catalytic activity. The 8Au4.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with the Au/Ag molar ratio of 1 is less active for cyclohexene hydrogenation than the monometallic 8Au/SBA-15."
7,Physicochemical features of bimetallic and monometallic catalysts,"3.2 Physicochemical features of bimetallic and monometallic catalysts ICP analysis reveals that the actual Au loading of monometallic Au/SBA-15 catalyst is 7.9wt%. Actual Ag loadings of monometallic Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/SBA-15-IMP are 4.1 and 4.0wt%, respectively (Table 3 ). Most of bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts possess actual Au loadings slightly lower than the nominal value (8wt%), except the 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 and 8Au0.75Ag/SBA-15 catalysts. The Ag/Au molar ratios of bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts analyzed by XPS are higher than that from ICP analysis, indicating the surface enrichment of Ag on these bimetallic catalysts. This result is in accordance with the previous study on supported AuAg NPs [42], in which high-temperature calcination in air induces the segregation of Ag to the surface of AuAg nano-alloy. It is ascribed to the formation of Ag2O layers on the external surface of AuAg NPs during the calcination in air. For Au/SBA-15 and AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts calcined at 823K, average metallic particle sizes determined by XRD and TEM are comparable (Table 3). Introducing Ag into Au/SBA-15 affords improved metallic dispersion. The average size of bimetallic NPs shows a tendency of decreasing with increasing Ag loading in the range of 0.5–4.5wt%. Interpretation on the role of Ag in stabilizing bimetallic AuAg NPs has been proposed in a previous report [42]. Although the improved dispersion induced by Ag incorporation into Au/SBA-15 is responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance of bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts to some extent, taking into account the fact that the 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst displays remarkably better catalytic activity over the monometallic 8Au/SBA-15 catalyst with comparable metal particle size (4.0 vs 4.7nm), the size effect of metal particle should not be the only origin for the promoting effect of Ag. APTES surface functionalization and NaBH4 deposition–reduction succeed in forming highly dispersed Au NPs on SBA-15 surfaces, but poor Ag dispersion is obtained on the Ag/SBA-15 from the same method. It is assumed that the difference in adsorption ability on SBA-15 surface and redox property between anionic Au precursor (HAuCl4) and cationic Ag precursor (AgNO3) are the main reasons. Volumetric impregnation method and calcination at relatively low temperature (623K) finely disperse Ag onto SBA-15 surface. TEM observation discloses that the resultant Ag/SBA-15-IMP possesses small Ag particle average size of ∼2.9nm (Fig. 1S). Mesoporous SBA-15 support perfectly preserves its 2D channel after loading Au and Ag onto SBA-15 surface. For the 4.5Ag/SBA-15 with poor metal dispersion, large Ag grains emerge on the external surface of SBA-15 (Fig. S1(C)). For 8Au/SBA-15, 8Au4.5Ag/SBA-15 and 4.5Ag/SBA-15-IMP, small metal particles are observed to homogeneously disperse on the surfaces of SBA-15 channels. Since the Ag atoms on bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 not only act as the promoter but also serve as the catalytically active component, the turnover frequencies (TOFs) based on total surface metal amount are calculated and listed in the Table 3. For cyclohexene hydrogenation, the TOF of Au/SBA-15 catalyst (78.6h−1, d TEM =4.7nm) is remarkably higher than that of the highly dispersed Ag/SBA-15-IMP (2.9h−1, d TEM =2.9nm). Similarly, Au is also more efficient than Ag in CRAL hydrogenation. The TOF is about three times higher over Au than over Ag. Introducing a small amount of Ag into Au/SBA-15 greatly promotes the TOF for CRAL hydrogenation. The TOFAu&Ag of 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 with a low Ag loading of 0.5 wt% is about fivefold higher than that of 8Au/SBA-15. Further increasing Ag loading gradually decreases the TOFAu&Ag. The TOFAu&Ag of 8Au4.5Ag/SBA-15 with an Au/Ag molar ratio of 1 is slightly higher than that of 8Au/SBA-15 (48.4 vs 31.2h−1). For cyclohexene hydrogenation, the effect of Ag decoration on Au/SBA-15 is negligible. The TOFAu of 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 is higher than that of 8Au/SBA-15 (95.4 vs 78.6h−1), and the TOFAu&Ag based on total surface metal of the former is almost equal to that of 8Au/SBA-15 (80.5 vs 78.6h−1). Increasing Ag loading leads to the deterioration in catalytic efficiency. The TOFAu of 8Au4.5Ag/SBA-15 is only half of that of 8Au/SBA-15. Table S2 presents the comparison of TOF and Ea values of some reported catalysts for CRAL or acrolein hydrogenation. Although lower than that of an excellent Pt-based catalyst, Pt/Ga2O3 [49], the TOF value of the best 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst in this study is almost in the same level as an outstanding Au-based catalyst, AuIn/ZnO [21], for acrolein hydrogenation with comparable unsaturated alcohol selectivity. The difference in TOF values of various catalysts originates from not only the intrinsic difference of catalysts, but also the unavoidable differences in experimental conditions and other parameters."
8,FT-IR spectroscopic studies of CRAL adsorption and hydrogenation,"3.3 FT-IR spectroscopic studies of CRAL adsorption and hydrogenation The IR spectrum of vapor-phase CRAL is collected and shown in Fig. 5 (g). The assignments of IR bands are 2810cm−1 [ν(CH), CHO], 2725cm−1 [ν(CH), CHO], 1725cm−1 [ν(CO)], 1711cm−1 [ν(CO)] and 1650cm−1 [ν(CC)] [50]. As introducing CRAL vapor into IR cell containing pure SBA-15 wafer pre-treated with H2 at 623K, two characteristic bands at 1725 and 1711cm−1 attributed to ν(CO) of unabsorbed or physically-absorbed CRAL molecule emerge and gradually diminish under continuous evacuation (Fig. 5). Simultaneously, a noticeable band centered at 1674cm−1 ascribed to ν(CO) vibration of aldehyde group of surface CRAL species appears. It is unusual that the intensity of 1674cm−1 band further increases even after the evacuation has been initiated to remove unabsorbed CRAL. Long evacuation ultimately leads to the decrease of 1674cm−1 band intensity due to the surface species desorption. Four IR bands at 2839, 2735, 1446 and 1395cm−1 show almost parallel variation trends in IR absorbance intensity as the 1674cm−1 band. The first two bands are assigned to the blue-shifted νC-H vibrations on SBA-15 surface-ligated aldehyde groups. The last two bands are ascribed to asymmetric and symmetric δ(CH3) vibrations of methyl groups. Strong IR bands at 3800–3100cm−1 and 1030–900cm−1, assigned to νOH and νSiO vibrations of surface SiOH groups, respectively, arise from the reaction between silica surface and trace amounts of water vapor in carrier gas and CRAL vapor. Surface adsorption of CRAL on SBA-15, 8Au/SBA-15, 4.5Ag/SBA-15 and 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 is then investigated and compared (Fig. 5). After removing the unadsorbed and physically-adsorbed CRAL by evacuation at 393K, the remaining IR band for ν(CO) vibration of adsorbed aldehyde group on monometallic 8Au/SBA-15 and 4.5Ag/SBA-15 locates at 1674cm−1, same as for CRAL species on pure SBA-15. On bimetallic 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15, the ν(CO) vibration band blue-shifts to 1697cm−1. Furthermore, an IR feature at 1385cm−1 assigned to the symmetric δ(CH3) vibration of methyl group of surface CRAL species emerges noticeably. This IR band is about 10cm−1 red-shifted as compared to the corresponding band at 1395cm−1 on pure SBA-15 (Fig. 5). Unusual spectroscopic results on bimetallic 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 include the following: (1) The intensity of the symmetric δ(CH3) IR band of adsorbed CRAL species on 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 is remarkably stronger than that on SBA-15 or monometallic catalysts; (2) the relative intensity of the symmetric δ(CH3) band to the ν(CO) band is dramatically enhanced; and (3) the asymmetric δ(CH3) IR band, which usually ought to emerge with symmetric δ(CH3) band in pair, almost completely disappears. The difficulties in interpreting these strange IR observations are solved by applying the “metal-surface selection rule” (MSSR) known in surface infrared spectroscopy [51]. The MSSR illustrates that, as a result of image dipoles on conductive metal, the dipole changes of molecular vibrations perpendicular to the metal surface will be reinforced, yet those in parallel direction cancels out. For the terminal methyl group of CRAL, the vibrational dipole change for asymmetric δ(CH3) is perpendicular to that for the symmetric δ(CH3) vibration and approximately vertical to the CC bond. According to the MSSR, the reinforcement or forbiddance of two δ(CH3) vibrations of methyl group is expected to be greatly different at diverse adsorption conformations of CRAL. Since the terminal methyl group seems unlikely to bond with surface sites directly, the adsorption of the CC bond on metallic surface is then believed to be dominant. In di-σ bonded adsorption mode (C2M2, M=Au or Ag) of CC bond, the dipole change of the symmetric δ(CH3) vibration of CRAL surface species is restricted to a direction approximately perpendicular to the metal surface, thus showing reinforced symmetric δ(CH3) band. Similar reinforcement of the symmetric δ(CH3) band at 1350cm−1 under the MSSR for a di-σ adsorption mode of propene molecule on a Pt/SiO2 surface has also been reported by Shahid et al. [52]. The emerge of special di-σ bonded CRAL surface species and the blue-shifted ν(CO) vibration band at 1697cm−1 on bimetallic 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 clearly indicate that the Ag decoration on Au/SBA-15 creates unique metallic adsorption sites for CRAL surface chemisorption and activation. Subsequently, the impact of dihydrogen on surface CRAL species over SBA-15, 8Au/SBA-15, 4.5Ag/SBA-15 and 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 is investigated under 393K and a mild hydrogen pressure of ca. 5bar (Fig. 6 ). For SBA-15 with chemisorbed CRAL species, introducing dihydrogen into IR cell does not obviously weaken or change the 1674cm−1 band for ν(CO) vibration, whereas two bands at 2970 and 2885cm−1 characteristic of CH stretch of saturated hydrocarbons gradually strengthen as the contacting time increases from 30 to 1800s, implying that the CC bond hydrogenation occurs slowly over pure SBA-15. The possibility that SBA-15 surface catalyzes the CC bond hydrogenation cannot be ruled out, since the silica surface has also been proposed to be able to dissociate H2 molecules [37]. Over Au/SBA-15 and Ag/SBA-15 with CRAL surface species, the intensity of 1674cm−1 ν(CO) vibration IR band gradually decreases upon the exposure to hydrogen (Fig. 6B and C), probably arising from the slow hydrogenation reaction between the surface-ligated CO bond and active hydrogen species. Moreover, the possibility of CRAL surface species desorption induced by competing adsorption of hydrogen cannot be ruled out. The 2970 and 2885cm−1 bands for CH stretch of saturated hydrocarbon on 8Au/SBA-15 grow more quickly than on SBA-15 and Ag/SBA-15, suggesting that the presence of Au on SBA-15 promotes the CC hydrogenation. Over the bimetallic 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with the best CRAL hydrogenation activity, the symmetric δ(CH3) IR band at 1385cm−1 and the ν(CO) vibration at 1697cm−1 obviously weaken shortly after the dihydrogen is introduced (Fig. 6D). The growth of IR features at 2970 and 2885cm−1 for saturated hydrocarbon is faster than on the monometallic 8Au/SBA-15, suggesting the superiority of the 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 over monometallic 8Au/SBA-15 in catalyzing the CC bond hydrogenation. In addition, several IR bands at 1725, 1620 and 1396cm−1 appear as the 1385 and 1697cm−1 IR bands weaken. The 1725cm−1 band can be ascribed to the ν(CO) of unabsorbed or physically-absorbed CRAL molecule gas phase some stable surface CRAL species, possibly arising from the desorption of the surface-ligated CO bond of CRAL species with IR band at 1697cm−1 induced by the impact of hydrogen. The ascription of the 1620 and 1396cm−1 IR bands remains unclear."
9,Discussion,"Significantly improved CRAL hydrogenation with enhanced reaction rate and CROL selectivity was observed on a bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalyst with a moderate Ag loading. The catalytic study on reaction parameters revealed that high hydrogen pressure and low CRAL/H2 ratio were beneficial for accelerating hydrogenation rate and promoting CROL selectivity (Table 2). These results suggested that the activation of dihydrogen and the supply of active hydrogen species were vital steps. The enhancement in CROL selectivity induced by increasing dihydrogen partial pressure while keeping the H2/CRAL ratio constant implied that the CO bond hydrogenation outperformed the CC bond hydrogenation at high hydrogen surface coverage. Furthermore, increasing the partial pressure of CRAL but retaining that of dihydrogen resulted in the decline of CRAL hydrogenation rate and CROL selectivity, suggesting the existence of the surface adsorption competition among hydrogen, CO and CC bond of CRAL. The competition between dihydrogen and CC bond may be more pronounced than that between hydrogen and CO bond, thus resulting in higher CROL selectivity under higher hydrogen partial pressure. In the CC bond hydrogenation of cyclohexene, Ag/SBA-15 was almost inactive. However, Ag/SBA-15 catalyzed CRAL hydrogenation to some extent with CROL from CO bond hydrogenation as the main product, implying the unique characteristics of Ag in catalyzing CO bond hydrogenation. On bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts, the Ag loading crucially influenced the CRAL hydrogenation activity and product distribution. Highest CROL selectivity was observed on the 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with the lowest Ag loading and further increasing Ag loading inversely resulted in the decrease of CROL selectivity. As revealed by characterization results, adding Ag into Au/SBA-15 induced interesting changes such as reduction in metallic NPs size, formation of Ag surface-rich AuAg alloy NPs and enhancement of thermal stability against sintering, which were beneficial to increase the quantity of surface active sites and catalyst stability. To further explore the origin of effect of Ag addition, study on the CRAL surface chemisorption by in situ IR was performed. The IR spectra (Fig. 5) of CRAL surface species on pure SBA-15 support remained against evacuation revealed that siliceous surface sites were able to chemisorb CRAL via bonding the aldehyde group. The IR spectra of the CRAL surface species on monometallic Ag or Au/SBA-15 were almost identical as on SBA-15, indicating that most of CRAL surface species were ligated on SBA-15 surface and the adsorption of CRAL on Au or Ag surface was relatively weak. Remarkably, the CRAL surface species on bimetallic 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst against evacuation were different. Their significantly reinforced symmetric δ(CH3) IR band under the MSSR suggested the CRAL chemisorption in C2M2 di-σ bonded mode on bimetallic surface. In addition, the ν(CO) vibration band of the CRAL surface species on 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 blue-shifted to 1697cm−1 as compared to monometallic Ag or Au/SBA-15. These facts indicated that Ag decoration on Au created unique metallic surface sites with enhanced CRAL adsorption. Under the impact of dihydrogen, the weakening rate of the ν(CO) vibration IR band of the CRAL surface species on the 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 was faster than on the siliceous surface of SBA-15 and monometallic Au or Ag/SBA-15. An additional IR test to investigate the adsorption of propylene on the 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 did not give any observable signals for surface propylene species in C2M2 di-σ bonded mode, suggesting that the strong surface ligating of the CC bond of CRAL was interdependent with the co-adsorption of the conjugated CO bond. Another interesting result was that the dihydrogen activation and hydrogenation of CC bond occurred on the pure SBA-15 as supported by the slowly growing IR bands of saturated hydrocarbons after introducing dihydrogen to CRAL surface species (Fig. 6A). Further investigation revealed that Au NPs on SBA-15 promoted the hydrogenation to produce saturated hydrocarbons to some extent but Ag NPs were almost inactive, suggesting the superiority of Au over Ag in activating dihydrogen and/or the CC bond. Severe surface adsorption competition between dihydrogen and CRAL possibly existed on metallic surfaces because the CRAL/H2 ratio markedly influenced the product selectivity and hydrogenation rate. The in situ IR study of the impact of dihydrogen on strong CRAL surface species over the 8Au1.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst further supported this speculation. The degree of surface coverages of hydrogen and CRAL species in different activation modes determined by both catalyst nature and reaction parameters may be decisive for the product distribution. The active sites for the activation of the polar CO bond and the non-polar HH and CC bond may be different and the diffusion of surface active species was also a key step influencing hydrogenation rate and product distribution. As shown in Scheme 1 , it was speculated that, on bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 with improved CRAL hydrogenation performance, most of dihydrogen activation occur on Au active sites and the formed active hydrogen species were able to spill-over to neighboring CRAL active species on different surface sites in close proximity. Non-polar CC bond may seriously compete for these Au adsorption site with dihydrogen. In the adsorption and activation of the polar CO bond, some surface Ag sites or Ag-promoted catalytic sites may play important role."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, Ag decoration on Au/SBA-15 was reported to afford excellent bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts with improved hydrogenation rate, CROL selectivity and stability in vapor-phase chemoselective hydrogenation of CRAL. As compared to monometallic Ag/SBA-15 or Au/SBA-15 catalyst, these bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalysts catalyzed CRAL hydrogenation with lower apparent activation energies and higher TOF values. Highest TOF for CRAL hydrogenation was observed on the 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with a low Ag loading of 0.5 wt%. Reaction parameters remarkably influenced the hydrogenation rate and product distribution. Increasing hydrogen partial pressure and elevating H2/CRAL ratio were beneficial to accelerate CRAL hydrogenation rate and increase CROL selectivity. However, in cyclohexene hydrogenation, these bimetallic catalysts did not exhibit better catalytic activities than monometallic Au/SBA-15, except the 8Au0.5Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with low Ag loading. In situ FT-IR investigation revealed that unusual C2M2 di-σ bonded CRAL surface species with an extremely reinforced symmetric δ(CH3) IR band at 1385cm−1 under the MSSR were formed on bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15 catalyst. Moreover, their ν(CO) IR band at 1697cm−1 was also different from those on monometallic Ag or Au/SBA-15. The enhanced CRAL chemisorption on bimetallic AuAg surface was possibly due to the relatively strong ligating of CO bond on Ag active sites and consequent enhancement of the co-adsorption of the conjugated double bonds of CRAL. Significantly promoted hydrogenation rate and CROL selectivity under high dihydrogen partial pressure suggested the importance of the activation of dihydrogen and the supply of active hydrogen species in CRAL hydrogenation. The active sites for the activation of the polar CO bond may be different from those for the non-polar HH and CC bond. The degree of surface coverages of hydrogen and CRAL species in different activation modes determining the reaction rate and product distribution was greatly influenced by both catalyst nature and reaction parameters. It was speculated that, on the optimal bimetallic AuAg/SBA-15, most of dihydrogen activations occur on Au active sites and the formed active hydrogen species were apt to spill-over to neighboring CRAL active species on different surface sites. Ag decoration on Au/SBA-15 probably generated some active sites with unique characteristics in close proximity favoring the rapid completion of catalytic reaction, especially the CO bond hydrogenation."
