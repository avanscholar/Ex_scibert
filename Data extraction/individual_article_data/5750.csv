0,Introduction,"Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a kinetically slow process at the base of many environmental friendly chemical and electrochemical processes. ORR may proceed through two ways: one is a direct four-electron pathway, where O2 is reduced directly to water without involvement of H2O2 (Eq. (1)); the other is a two-step two-electron pathway where H2O2 is formed as an intermediate (Eqs. (2) and (3)) [1]. (1) O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − ⇆ 2 H 2 O E O = 1.23 V (2) O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − ⇆ H 2 O 2 E O = 0.69 V (3) H 2 O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − ⇆ 2 H 2 O E O = 1.76 V The direct reduction of O2 to H2O remains the key limiting factor of the cathodic compartment performance in the fuel cell and metal-air batteries and represents a milestone for the present and future energy challenges. On the other hand, H2O2 is gaining attention as ideal energy carrier alternative to H2 in fuel cell [2,3]. The production of H2O2 is of historical importance due to its large role in environmentally friendly methods in the chemical industry. H2O2 is a widespread disinfectant and bleach product used in cosmetics, in house holding, in manufacture industry and in water treatment [4]. A common environmental application of H2O2 is in the Fenton's reagent, an aqueous mixture of H2O2 and Fe2+, that under acidic conditions, generates the highly oxidant hydroxyl radicals [5]. Independently from the different application fields, both reduction pathways are kinetically hindered, therefore catalysts must be used to boost the efficiency of the reduction process. Traditionally, platinum and its alloys are the electrocatalysts of choice for the four electron pathway [6–8], whereas, at present, there is a lack of efficient and economically competitive electrocatalysts for H2O2 [9]. In fact, H2O2 is produced on an industrial scale almost exclusively by the anthraquinone mediated oxidation reaction, which can hardly be considered a green method since it requires significant energy costs and generates waste [10]. H2O2 is usually marketed as aqueous solutions at concentrations of 35, 50, and 70 w% with an added stabilizer. Stabilizers are needed due to the high rate of decomposition, which produces gaseous oxygen and heat (100.4 kJ mol−1); therefore transport, storage, and handling of H2O2 is hazardous and demanding, even though most final applications require very dilute solutions. Thus, novel and cleaner methods for the production of H2O2 are being explored and the development of electrolyzers for the in situ generation of H2O2 is particularly attractive [9]. Many catalysts have been proposed for the direct generation of the H2O2, unfortunately, catalysts for the direct synthesis of H2O2 are also effective for its subsequent decomposition to water, and this sets a limit for their development. Hence, there is an increasing interest in developing catalysts for the ORR that selectively promote H2O2. Carbon materials are well-known cathodes for two-electron reduction of oxygen to H2O2 and the best choice as electrocatalyst support [11–13]. At present, H2O2 can be synthesized on a graphite cathode in sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid solution in membrane-type electrochemical cell [4]. Among all carbon materials, mesoporous carbons (MCs) are materials with large surface area, tunable pore structure, uniform and adjustable pore size, mechanical stability, and good conductivity. All these properties make MCs superior to other carbon materials such as, for example, Vulcan XC-72R [11,14]. The advantage of working with mesoporous materials is a favorable mass transport: therefore the chemical intermediates can be released within a relatively short contact time, avoiding subsequent reactions which would lower the process selectivity [15]. Like graphite, MCs are hydrophobic and inert in nature; however, their surface modification can promote both the electrochemical activity and the wettability needed for the implementation of an electrode to be employed in an electrolyzer. From this perspective, MC activity can be tailored (enhanced) through surface modification with heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, boron, phosphorus and so on, obtaining de facto a metal-free and cost-effective electrocatalyst [16–24]. The catalytic properties of doped carbons towards ORR is a well consolidated results in literature [25–28]. However, the chemical implications determining the selectivity of doped carbon materials toward the ORR are still an open issue. In a previous paper we found that the ORR selectivity in graphene oxide quantum dots can be switched quite easily from a 2e– pathway to a 4e– pathway simply by chemically reducing the doped materials [29]. The presence of oxygen functional groups therefore represents a pivotal factor for controlling the chemical selectivity [30]. Keeping this in mind, in the present study, we propose to start from several different organic precursors for the production of high surface nitrogen and sulfur doped or co-doped MCs (hereafter, N-MC, S-MC and N,S-MC) for the electrochemical generation of H2O2. We have successfully synthesized doped MCs following a hard template approach and studied their physico-chemical properties and electrocatalytic activity for ORR in acidic and alkaline media. Moreover, we discuss the effect of the functional groups introduced into MC on its electrocatalytic properties."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Mesoporous Silica (MS) (200 nm particle size, 4 nm pore size), phenanthrene (>98%), 1,10 phenanthroline (>99.5%), phenothiazine (>98%), carbazole (>95%), dibenzothiophene (>98%), indigo carmine (>98%), were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used as received without further purification. Ethanol (Fluka HPLC, >99,8%), Nafion (Sigma Aldrich, 5 ww% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water), acetone (Sigma Aldrich, >99,5%), H2SO4 (Fluka, ≥95%, TraceSELECT®), NaOH (VWR, >99%). The commercial mesoporous carbon (C-MC) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (<500 nm particle size, 99.95%) and used as received."
3,Material syntheses,"2.2 Material syntheses Condensed aromatic heterocycles were adopted as precursor materials for the synthesis of different MCs. Actually, the pyridinic group was found to be responsible for the increasing of ORR catalytic activities [26,27,29,31]. The adopted precursors are listed in Fig. 1 , and in the following the corresponding MC have been labeled as N-MC-1 (1,10 phenanthroline), N-MC-2 (carbazole), N,S-MC-1 (phenothiazine), S-MC-1 (dibenzothiophene), N,S-MC-2 (indigo carmine) and MC (phenanthrene). For all the investigated MCs the preparative procedure consists in the dissolution of 1 g of silica and 1 g of organic precursor in 15 mL of acetone or ethanol depending on the precursor solubility in the medium. 200–300 μL H2SO4 were also added to facilitate the oligomerization of the precursors during the impregnation process. Silica acts as a template matrix, imprinting the mesoporosity to the resulting MCs. The solution is dried in an oven for over 1 h at 100 °C, in order to remove all traces of solvent until a brownish powder remains. The powder is subsequently heated in a quartz tube; with a ramp of 5 °C min−1 until the temperature reaches the setup pyrolysis temperature. Once the temperature is reached, the compound is left in the tube for 2 h at constant temperature. The system is finally cooled down for an entire night till room temperature (r.t.) is reached. Before starting the heating treatment, a flux of nitrogen at r.t. is sent into the quartz tube for about 1 h, in order to eliminate oxygen traces as much as possible since it could lead to combustion instead of pyrolysis lowering the final yield. The pyrolysis temperature was optimized in order to find the better conditions for keeping high the doping content and the surface area. In particular, the optimization has been carried out for 1,10-phenanthroline, which was pyrolyzed at several temperatures, i.e. 750, 850, 950, and 1050 °C. The work up of the carbon powder obtained from the pyrolysis consists in the etching of the template by treating it with a liquid solution of 20 mL of NaOH and 20 mL of ethanol. The mixture reacts with the silica by dissolving it, while the carbon precipitates. The carbon is then separated by vacuum filtration on a nylon nanometric filter (GVS, nylon 0.2 μm, 47 mm membrane diameter)."
4,Electrochemical tests,"2.3 Electrochemical tests The electrochemical activity measurements were carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) voltammetry, using an Autolab Model 101N potentiostat. A conventional three-electrode configuration consisting of a glassy carbon (GC) electrode with an area of 0.071 cm2 as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (Hg|Hg2Cl2|Cl− (sat); SCE) as reference electrode, was used. A salt bridge was employed to avoid chloride contamination. The GC was polished to a mirror finish with silicon carbide papers of decreasing grain size (Struers, grit: 500, 1000, 2400, 4000) followed by diamond paste (3-, 1-, 0.25-μm particle size). The catalyst inks were prepared by finely grinding MC in a mortar in order to obtain an even finer powder, then 2.5 mg of MC were added to 2.5 mL of Nafion solution and sonicated for 3 min. 10 μL of suspension were carefully pipetted onto a clean GC electrode and dried in air at r.t. for at least 12 h. The CV, LSV and RDE studies were carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 or 0.5 M KOH and the solutions were purged with Ar before each measurement, whereas for the ORR test, the solution was bubbled with high-purity O2 gas for at least 30 min to ensure O2 saturation. The determination of the number of transferred electrons was carried out via the ring (Pt) rotating disk (GC) electrode (RRDE, Metrohm Italiana Srl) technique. The RRDE, (disk diameter 5 mm, with a collection efficiency of 25%, was prepared by drop casting 50 μL of the catalyst ink onto the surface of the GC disk with a Hamilton microliter syringe. The electrode was dried at r.t. for 6 h prior to immersion into the electrochemical cell for data acquisition. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded using a Biologic Model SP300 potentiostat; the EIS curves were collected at RDE, setting the potential at E 1/2 of the investigated MC, in the O2 saturated 0.5 M H2SO4, in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz with 10 points per decade. The amplitude of the AC voltage was 5 mV. Without specification, the potential in the present paper was referred to standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The conversion of the potential measured versus SCE to the SHE scale is obtained by adding +0.241 V to the measured value [32]."
5,Physico-chemical characterization,"2.4 Physico-chemical characterization The specific surface areas of the samples were calculated by a multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms recorded at 77 K using a Quantachrome Nova 1200e Surface Area and Pore Analyzer, whereas the pore size distribution curves were derived using density functional theory (DFT), both on the adsorption and desorption branches. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on 10 mg samples using a Q5000IR TGA instrument (TA Waters) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 900 °C under N2. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed in an UHV chamber (base pressure <5 × 10−9 mbar), equipped with a double anode X-ray source (omicron DAR-400), a hemispherical electron analyzer (omicron EIS-125) at r.t., using non-monochromatized Mg-Kα radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV) and a pass energy of 50 eV and 20 eV for the survey and the single spectral windows, respectively. The calibration of the Binding Energy (BE) scale was carried out using Au 4f as reference (BE Au 4f = 84.0 eV). To obtain the surface stoichiometry of the doped MCs, the intensity of the O 1s, N 1s and S 2p XPS peaks have been considered taking into consideration the differential cross section and inelastic mean free path of photoelectrons. The XPS peaks of carbon and nitrogen were separated into single chemical shifted components (after Shirley background removal), using symmetrical Voigt functions; the χ2 was minimized by the use of a nonlinear least squares routine. To perform XPS measurements, 2.5 mg of the MC powders were dispersed in 50 μL of toluene and then gently sonicated (for 5 min) in order to efficiently disperse the powders; the solutions were then drop-casted onto electropolished polycrystalline copper or GC substrates (with a surface area of 1 cm2). The samples were first dried overnight under nitrogen flux to obtain homogeneous films; then they were vacuum-dried for 2 h at about 10−6 mbar. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a Zeiss Supra 35VP Gemini scanning electron microscope operating at 5 kV and a FEI Tecnai G2 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV, respectively. Elemental analyses were performed by Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 analyzer. Raman scattering experiments were conducted with a home-built Macro-Raman setup, already described in previous publications [33,34]. The excitation wavelength was 514 nm. The size of the laser spot at the sample was about 3 mm by 80 μm and the power at the sample about 12 mW (Intensity = 5 W/cm2). Cyclohexane was used as a frequency standard for the calibration of the Raman shift. Every spectrum was acquired as the average of a minimum number of 10 spectra with a minimum of 10 s integration time. A minimum of three points on the sample were recorded and all spectra turned out to be identical. Test measurements were recorded also with a home-built Micro-Raman setup [35–37] operating at 514 nm with a 20× objective and showed that also in this configuration the spectra do not depend on the illuminated point of the sample."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Preparation and physico-chemical characterization of doped mesoporous carbon,"3.1 Preparation and physico-chemical characterization of doped mesoporous carbon The synthesis of N-MC-1 performed at 750 °C affords almost spherical MC particles characterized by a mean radius of 150 nm; representative SEM images are shown in Fig. 2 a and b. A more detailed morphological study of N-MC-1 particles was carried out with TEM measurements, which point out the presence of solid spherical carbon particles (Fig. 2c and d), where pores are visible as orderly located aligned channels achieving a loosely packed nanostructure (Fig. 2c). The nitrogen-adsorption isotherms of N-MC-1 prepared at different temperature are presented in Fig. 2e. N-MC-1 obtained at 750 °C (N-MC-1@750) follows a type IV isotherm according to IUPAC classification [38], whereas N-MC-1s synthetized at higher temperatures (N-MC-1@850, N-MC-1@950 and N-MC-1@1050) follow a type II isotherm. For all the samples the lack of hysteresis loop is associated with a reduced capillary condensation occurring inside the mesopores. N-MC-1 has high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas (SBET), ranging between 823 and 972 m2 g−1; the change in pyrolysis temperature appears to not deeply affect the SBET, even though it is clear that the increase of the temperature results in a detriment of SBET. The SBET values along with the specific pore volume (V p), and pore diameters (d p) of N-MC-1 are summarized in Table 1 . The computational DFT model consistently fits the experimental data considering cylindrical and spherical pore geometry [39]; a representative pore size distribution is shown in Fig. 2f. N-MC-1@750 shows a narrow pore size distribution centered at ∼3.6 nm for mesopores and 1 nm for micropores and therefore N-MC-1@750 falls within the mesoporous range material (2–50 nm). The effect of increasing the temperature is a reduction of the pore volume and pore diameter; in particular it is worth noting that in N-MC-1@1050 only micropores are present. Therefore, the general effect of the temperature is the reduction of the number and dimension of mesopores, so that also the SBET results lower. Table 1 reports also the nitrogen content expressed in weight percentage determined by elemental analysis; the percentage of nitrogen decreases from 7.32% to 3.54% passing from 750 °C to 1050 °C. TGA of N-MC-1@750 depicted in the Fig. S1 indicates that the material starts to decompose in N2 at 500 ° C. The derivative of the TGA curve (DTG) shows one pronounced weight loss at 609 °C and one more but of lower intensity at 586 °C, visible as a shoulder of the main peak. The significant mass loss is attributed to the thermal oxidation of carbon powder involving breakage of C–C and C–N bonds [40–42]. The weight loss increases rapidly with the further increase of the combustion temperature. This process lasts until all of the carbon spheres were burnt off at about 640 °C. TGA shows lower decomposition temperature for N-MC-1 in comparison to a graphitized commercial MC, which demonstrates that N-MC-1 possesses lower thermal stability. This may be due to the incorporation of nitrogen in the carbon matrix, inducing a more defective structure. In order to characterize the chemical modifications induced by the pyrolysis temperature, we carried out XPS measurements for all the samples. In the large range measurements (surveys, not shown), three main peaks are observed for all N-MC-1, i.e. C 1s, N 1s and O 1s. The C 1s region relative to the N-MC-1@750, shows a broad peak (Fig. 3 a), which can be fitted with three main components assigned to C sp2 species (C–C, BE = 284.4 eV), to C sp3 species (C–H and C–C, BE = 284.9 eV) and to C sp3 species bound to N and O (BE = 286.5 eV). In the higher BE tail some components from CO bonds (BE = 287.8 eV) can be also singled out [27]. Similarly, the broad O 1s peak can be fitted with four components (Fig. 3b) corresponding to carbonyl oxygen in esters or amides 530.8 eV; oxygen atoms in hydroxyls or ethers 531.6 eV, the ether oxygen atoms in esters 532.6 eV and carboxyl groups 533.7 eV [43]. Samples prepared at higher temperatures show, in agreement with what found in the case of the C 1s signal, a lower content of CO bonds (positive signal at 534 eV), while, according to C 1s and O 1s difference spectra, less oxidized carbon species are present in higher quantity (see Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Information). N 1s XPS region is reported in Fig. 3c; three different components centered at 398.4 eV (pyridinic), 399.6 eV (pyrrolic) and 400.7 eV (N graphitic) and corresponding to sp2-N defects (see the model in Fig. 3f) have been identified [27]. A fourth component centered at 401.6 eV and consistent with oxidized nitrogen [17] can be added for a better fitting of the spectra. Since the precursor used is phenanthroline, the N 1s component associated with pyridinic species is found in higher amount at 750 °C, decreasing at higher temperatures along with oxidized N that can be barely considered in the fitting procedure. Graphitic N and pyrrolic species, instead, increase by increasing the preparation temperature. This can be easily visualized in the N 1s difference spectra (Fig. 3d) where negative signals between 402 and 404 eV are visible and positive signals are between 398 and 402 eV. The higher thermal stability of graphitic N has been observed by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) investigation on several carbon materials such as HOPG [27], carbon nanotubes [44] and amorphous carbon [45]. In particular the thermal treatment of N-doped HOPG seems to indicate a greater thermodynamic stability of these defects as it can be easily inferred considering that in this case the N atoms can exploit the highest coordination with other C atoms [27]. This is further confirmed in Fig. 3e where the percentage of the area for each chemically shifted peak versus the pyrolysis temperature is shown. In Fig. 3e an interesting feature is the decrease of the pyridinic nitrogen groups as the pyrolysis temperature increases, whereas N graphitic and pyrrolic intensity increases with increasing temperature. In the present case, the higher concentration of pyrrolic groups at higher temperature is not fully supported by TPD findings reported in literature [44], but this is not in contradiction with our results since we may assume that, regardless of the organic precursor, a kinetic contribution concurs to influencing the functional groups in the final pyrolysis products. N-MC-1@750 has shown to possess the highest nitrogen content, high pore volume and BET surface area (see Table 1). On the basis of these findings, five new MCs were prepared at a pyrolysis temperature of 750 °C, starting from precursors reported in Fig. 1. Along with N-MC-1, the undoped MC, the nitrogen doped N-MC-2, the sulfur doped S-MC-1 and the nitrogen-sulfur co-doped N,S-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2 were prepared. MC and the commercial product (C-MC) were employed as reference systems to gauge the effect of the heteroatoms on the physico-chemical properties and catalytic activity of the doped MCs. All the synthetized MCs were characterized by SEM, confirming that the hard template procedure affords spherical shape MC particles with a mean radius of 150 nm; representative SEM images are reported in Fig. 4 a. Fig. 4b shows BET nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (IUPAC type IV) [38] for the MCs, each being characterized by capillary condensation steps in the mesopore range. The hysteresis can be classified as H4 type, often associated with narrow slit pores, but in the present case including pores also in the micro and mesopore regions. From these considerations the choice to use a DFT model to describe the sorption and phase behavior of liquid nitrogen in slit and cylindrical pores is correct, as confirmed by the excellent agreement between the fitted curve and the experimental one of each sample. According to BET data reported in Table 2 , all the prepared MCs are characterized by a high surface area, ranging from 810 m2 g−1 for N-MC-2 to 1103 m2 g−1 for S-MC-1. As already observed for N-MC-1, all MCs have high pore volume and narrow pore size distributions centered at ∼3.7 nm and ∼1 nm for mesopores and micropores, respectively. The elemental and XPS analyses confirmed the presence of nitrogen in the samples N-MC-1, N-MC-2, N,S-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2 and sulfur in the samples N,S-MC-1, N,S-MC-2 and S-MC-1. It is worth noting that sulfur traces were found by elemental analysis in N-MC-1 and N-MC-2, possibly coming from H2SO4 employed during the impregnation stage of the synthesis (Table 2). The nitrogen content decreases in the order N-MC-1 > N,S-MC-2 > N,S-MC-1 > N-MC-2, and this behavior suggests that there is a correlation between the C/N ratio in the precursor molecule and the corresponding MC. It is interesting to observe that the highest sulfur content was obtained in the case of S-MC-1 (13.79% w/w) (Table 2). S functional groups are generally very thermolabile and therefore it is very difficult to find examples in the literature reporting mesoporous carbons, or other carbon supports, with such a high level of covalently bonded sulfur [46,47]. Also when phenothiazine or indigo carmine are employed as precursors rather high sulfur contents were obtained (4.12% w/w and 6.38% w/w, respectively); this states that the employed pyrolysis procedure offers a practical and reproducible way for obtaining MCs with high dopant content. In Fig. 4(c–f) the high-resolution XPS peaks and the fitting components for the C 1s, O 1s, N 1s and S 2p signals in N,S-MC-1 are reported, as an example, while Table S2 reports the results for the fitting procedure. The deconvoluted spectra for all cases are reported in Supporting information, Fig. S3–S6. The C 1s and O 1s peaks, for all the investigated MCs, present three and four main components, respectively. The two peaks can be analyzed in the same way as in N-MC-1 and therefore they will be only briefly discussed here (Fig. S3–S4). S-MC-1 is characterized by the highest amount of sp2 carbon (graphite) and the lowest amount of C–O–C, C–N and C–OH groups. Similar amounts of sp2, sp3 and oxidized carbon atoms are found in the other MCs. It is interesting to note that the presence of both N and S shifts the C 1s peak by about 0.2–0.3 eV to higher BE. In the case of O 1s, the most abundant component corresponds to hydroxyls and ethers at 531.6 eV. It is interesting to note how the presence of N and partly S atoms prevents a further oxidation of carbon so that a comparison with the O 1s signal of mesoporous carbon obtained from phenanthrene (MC) shows a higher degree of oxidation (O–CO bonds) in the latter. This is particularly evident in samples N-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2 that are in fact those with the highest amount of nitrogen. The N 1s peak is present in N-MC-2, N,S-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2 and can be fitted with two, three or four components depending on the MC. The pyridinic (∼398.3 eV) and the graphitic N (∼400.6 eV) groups are the most abundant functional groups for all MCs, whereas the pyrrolic group is present in N-MC-1, N,S-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2 (Table S1). N oxidized species, where N is directly bonded to O atom, is also present in the tail of the XPS spectrum at higher BE, although in low percentage. It is interesting to observe that the graphitic component is in all cases the most abundant one, so that, at least for N-MC-2, N,S-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2 it is possible to exclude a “chemical memory effect”, where the chemical state of nitrogen atoms in the starting precursor is transferred to the MC. S-MC-1, N,S-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2 XPS show also the presence of a S 2p peak. The S 2p photoemission peak is fitted by a single component centered at 163.9 eV, which represents the sulfide –C–S–C– often referred as thiophenic-like units (Fig. S5) [22,25]. In the case of N,S-MC-2 (Fig. S5c) two more components can be added to improve the fitting at 164.5 and 167.9 eV, that can be assigned to sulfinyl group [48] and oxidized sulfur (–C–SO3–C– groups) [22,48,49]."
8,Raman characterization,"3.2 Raman characterization The heterogeneous electron transfer rate between a carbon electrode and a redox system is well known to depend critically on several factors, related to the physicochemical and electronic properties of the electrode [27]. Several papers have demonstrated the relation existing between the carbon microstructure and the electron transfer activation [50,51]: for example Bowling showed that an electrochemical or a laser pretreatment performed on a HOPG electrode can enhance the electron transfer rate by several orders of magnitude and this process is associated with the growth of the D1 band at 1350 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the electrode. This led to the conclusion that the electron transfer activation crucially depends on the density of edge plane defects at the carbon electrode surface. On this basis, a Raman investigation of MCs has been carried out in order to achieve some information about their structural composition, that in turn can influence their catalytic activity. Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of the newly prepared doped mesoporous carbons and the commercial mesoporous carbon (C-MC); all spectra are normalized to the maximum of the G band and vertically shifted for clarity. The two intense bands observed at ∼1600 cm−1 and at ∼1350 cm−1 are the G (graphitic, E2g) and the D1 band (defect, A1g). Raman spectra can be interpreted on the basis of a phenomenological three-stage model, that shows the evolution of the G band position and of the D1/G ratio along an amorphization trajectory going from graphite to tetrahedral amorphous carbon (see for example ion implantation in glassy carbon) [52,53]. In the first stage of this model, graphite transforms into nanocrystalline-graphite (NC-graphite), where the three-dimensional order is lost due to the formation of nano-sized graphite crystallites. The Raman spectra accompanying this process exhibit a shift of the G-band peak from about 1580 cm−1 to about 1600 cm−1 and a rise of the D1/G ratio from 0 to 2. In the second stage NC-graphite coverts into amorphous carbon (G band around 1500 cm−1, D1/G ratio ≈ 0.2), that consists of mainly sp2 sites in puckered ring-like configurations (five-to eight-fold disordered rings) and in the third stage, amorphous carbon converts into tetrahedral amorphous carbon (G band around 1560 cm−1, D1/G ≈ 0), in which sp2 sites gradually converts from rings to olefin chains. It is also possible to follow an ordering pathway (for example by annealing an amorphous Carbon after synthesis) [54]: in this case the literature shows that hysteresis effects can occur leading, in general, to a non-unique relation among the G band position, the D1/G ratio and the sp3 content in stages 2 and 3. Moreover, notice that the elemental analysis shows that MCs possess significant hydrogen content: however, this does not influence the G and D peaks of visible Raman spectra and the three-stage model applies also to hydrogenated carbons. In order to recognize individual components in the Raman spectra, deconvolution analysis has been carried out. In the literature, commercial carbon blacks have been fitted with three bands [55] and other carbon materials with four or even five bands [56]. We found that in our case four bands were necessary to achieve a good fit: however, letting all parameters free, the fit became ambiguous, and depending on the starting values and on the band shape adopted, the fit reached several minima, all with a very good and similar adjusted R2 but corresponding to different band combinations. This probably arises from the overlap of the bands used to deconvolute the spectrum. Therefore, we finally fitted our experimental data on the basis of the bands already known from the literature: the frequency of the two bands corresponding to D1 and G were constrained between 1300 and 1400 cm−1 and between 1550 and 1650 cm−1 respectively. The frequency of the other two bands were fixed at 1500 cm−1 (D3 band) and 1200 (D4 band). In the literature, the D3 band is assigned to amorphous carbon and the D4 one has been tentatively related to the presence of polyenes or ionic impurities [56]. All band shapes were chosen Gaussian and FWHMs let free. In Fig. 5b an example of the fit for N-MC-1 is reported. Table S2 in SI summarizes the results of the fit procedure. In Fig. 5c the D1, D3 and D4 band areas, normalized to the G band area, are shown for all MCs. Their G-band position is reported in Fig. 5d. The results in the figure suggest that D1/G band ratio is very similar for all MCs: the spectral differences among the MCs seem to arise from the presence of other types of defects (D3 and D4). The D3/G band ratio seems to be the same for all MCs except for S-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2 for which it is lower. The D4/G band ratio is significantly lower in MCs than in C-MC (see also Appendix A in SI). Since all synthesized MCs show a G-band peak at ∼1600 cm−1 they can be assigned to a NC-graphite structure. The expected D1/G ratio is 2 and it coincides with the D1/G area ratio calculated from the fits for all synthesized MCs [53]. In the case of C-MC, the G band lies at 1586 cm−1 and the D1/G ratio around 2: these parameters would place C-MC between the middle of stage 1 and the middle of stage 2. It is worth noting that no clear relation between the type of precursor and the Raman spectra emerges: for example N-MC-2, N,S-MC-1, MC have very similar spectra but N-MC-2 contains N, N,S-MC-1 N and S, MC none of the two. The Raman analysis performed on N-MC-1 samples prepared at different temperature of pyrolysis (T = 750 (a), 850 (b), 950 (c), 1050 (d) °C) is shown in Fig. S7, where spectra are normalized to the maximum of the G band. A coarse visual comparison of the spectra suggests that the D1/G band ratio is almost independent of the T and that the amount of amorphous carbon slightly decreases at higher temperature. The spectra are fitted following the same method previously described (Fig. S7c); Fig. S7b shows the D1/G, D3/G, D4/G dependence on the T. Consistently with the observations previously done on Fig. 5a, the trends indicate a small variation of the D1/G ratio and a moderate reduction of the D3/G ratio for sample N-MC-1@1050 compared to the others. This analysis indicates that the amorphous carbon content slightly diminishes at higher pyrolysis temperature. Finally, this Raman analysis suggests that, being the D1/G ratio similar for all MCs, they should be characterized by the same density of edge plane defects and size of nano-crystallites. Therefore, the different electrochemical reactivity of MCs, illustrated in the following section, is not ascribable to structural differences among them."
9,Electrochemical characterization,"3.3 Electrochemical characterization The N-MC-1s prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures were tested by cyclic voltammetry and by linear sweep voltammetry at RDE in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 6 ). N-MC-1@750 shows an increased capacitance with respect to N-MC-1s prepared at higher temperatures; it is known that the presence of nitrogen functional groups induces a pseudocapacitive effect [57,58], caused by the increased number of intrinsic charges and by the adsorption of proton and electrolyte ions in the electrical double layer. In fact, the capacitance decreases as the nitrogen content becomes lower and this is evident comparing the background current of N-MC-1@750 with that of N-MC-1@1050. All the N-MC-1 backgrounds show a quasi-reversible redox peak couple in the potential range of 0.25–0.75 V vs. SHE. This type of surface electrochemical behavior is commonly found in other types of mesoporous carbons and carbon nanotubes modified electrodes [59]. As confirmed by the C 1s XPS analysis, the presence of these peaks may be ascribed to redox active surface oxygen functional groups such as hydroquinone/quinone couple (C–OH, CO), which undergoes proton coupled electron transfer and therefore their redox chemistry depends on the pH [60]. Furthermore, the hydroquinone/quinone groups are often referred as catalytic sites for oxygen reduction reaction, since they are considered electron transfer mediators [61]. It is worth noting that the peak feature becomes less prominent in MCs treated at high temperature and this would indicate a partial loss of C–OH and CO surface groups when higher pyrolysis temperatures are employed. Fig. 6b reports the voltammetry recorded in an O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for the N-MC-1s synthetized at different temperatures, whereas electrochemical data acquired both in O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 and O2-saturated 0.5 M KOH solutions are reported in Table 3. The voltammetry of a commercial mesoporous carbon (C-MC) is superimposed for sake of comparison since unmodified carbon materials such as C-MC are so far considered non-catalytic towards ORR reaction. Generally, the peak potential (E p) for the reduction of O2 is considered as a benchmark for the electrocatalytic activity of a material, therefore the quantity ΔE p = E p N−MC−1 − E p C−MC, indicates how good catalyst is a material with respect to a non-catalytic one taken as a reference (Table 3). ΔE p indicates that all N-MC-1s are active towards ORR; in particular the best performer is N-MC-1@750 which in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution exhibits a remarkable electrocatalytic effect of 0.398 V with respect to C-MC. The catalytic activity shows a dependence on the synthesis temperature and as a consequence on the nitrogen content in the order N-MC-1@750 > N-MC-1@850 ≈ N-MC-1@950 > N-MC-1@1050. The catalytic activity was further investigated in acidic condition at rotating disk electrode (RDE) at a scanning rate of 10 mVs−1 and different rotating speeds from 1000 to 3100 rpm (Fig. 6c). In steady state condition only N-MC-1@750, N-MC-1@850 and N-MC-1@950 approached an ideal plateau at all rotation rates, although the superimposition of other reactions, like hydrogen evolution, prevents to completely reach a constant limiting current. In the case of N-MC-1@1050 the electrochemical behavior is similar to that of C-MC, where the slow electron transfer kinetics involves the shift of the onset and half wave potentials towards more negative values, resulting in the merging of the O2 reduction signal with the solvent discharge and only a barely visible shoulder can be observed. The improved catalytic activity of nitrogen doped carbon based electrodes towards ORR is a well-established effect, generally ascribed to electron-accepting nitrogen atoms. In particular N graphitic and pyridinic groups generate a highly positive charge density on the adjacent carbon atoms, where oxygen molecules can adsorb more easily. In this case, we may assert that the discriminant effect is mainly played by the nitrogen content rather than the type of N functional groups since, as reported in the previous paragraph, the additional percentage of graphitic N and pyridinic groups is almost constant in all N-MC-1 samples (Fig. 3e), whereas the total nitrogen content change drastically passing from 750 to 1050 °C. The characterization of N-MC-1s was extended to 0.5 M KOH (Fig. 6d–f); in this medium it is still evident the higher capacitance for N-MC-1@750 with respect to N-MC-1s prepared at higher temperatures. However, the reversible peak due to the oxidation/reduction of quinonic groups is missing, since the proton coupled electron transfer is hindered at alkaline pH. Fig. 6e reports the cyclic voltammetries in O2 saturated 0.5 M KOH; it is worth noting that a catalytic effect is present but the O2 reduction occurs approximately at the same potential for all N-MC-1s. In fact, the E p ranges between −0.040 to −0.059 V vs. SHE, and this is also confirmed by onset and half wave potentials recorded at RDE (Table 4 ). Fig. 6f reports the RDE voltammetries for O2 reduction. The LSVs are composed of two reduction steps of almost the same height, and the current features are superimposable for all four N-MC-1s, thus confirming comparable electrocatalytic activity for all N-MC-1 carbons, notwithstanding the pyrolysis temperature. Typical current–potential curves at RRDE of N- and S-doped or co-doped carbons in an O2 saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte are shown in Fig. 7 a and b. Remarkably, in the presence of oxygen, all doped and co-doped MCs show higher current density polarization curves and a strongly lower overpotential (i.e., the electrochemical activation energy) with respect to commercial carbon C-MC (Table 4). A fair comparison of the catalytic activity can be made on the basis of the peak potential determined by cyclic voltammetry in steady condition. According to the determined E p values N-MC-1 is the most active material followed by N,S-MC-1, N-MC-2 and N,S-MC-2. It is worth noting that the S-doped S-MC-1 shows the lowest electrocatalytic activity similarly to the undoped MC. Fig. 7d shows the variation of the E p as function of the weight percentage of nitrogen determined by elemental analysis, whereas Fig. 7e reports the same quantity as function of the sulfur weight percentage. The positive slope of the interpolating line, which correlates the catalytic activity with the nitrogen content, indicates that the catalytic activity increases linearly with the nitrogen content. On the contrary, the negative slope of the interpolating line of Fig. 7e points out that, even though S-doped MCs have relevant catalytic activity, the increasing percentage of sulfur is detriment for the O2 reduction kinetics, i.e. the higher the sulfur content, the lower the catalytic activity. Many papers reports that sulfur doped electrocatalysts possess excellent ORR activity, but generally the sulfur content is restricted to low percentage (1–2%) [22,25,49,62]. Sulfur has similar electronegativity to carbon but larger atomic radius, differently from nitrogen, which has similar dimension to carbon but higher electronegativity. Therefore, the catalytic activity induced by the two different type of doping must arise from different grounds. The thiophenic groups increase the surface hydrophobicity [63] and induce more strain and defect sites in the carbon material [25], furthermore, it is claimed that sulfur facilitates the proton transfer during the reduction process [25]. Therefore, we may infer that when sulfur content increases above few percentage points, the proton transfer slows down and so the whole reaction, because of the lower electrode wettability, which limits the effective three-phase interface area. The oxygen reduction reaction basically follows two mechanisms, a 2e− pathway, leading to H2O2 (Eq. (2)), and a 4e− electron one leading directly to H2O (Eq. (1)). To investigate the mechanism of the electron transfer process, it is useful to use the Koutecky–Levich (K-L) plot, which correlates the limiting current recorded from a RDE linear sweep voltammetry to the rotation rate of the electrode according to the following relation: (4) 1 j = 1 nF k C O 2 + 1 0.62 nF ( D O 2 ) 2 3 ν − 1 6 C O 2 ω 1 2 In the K-L equation j is the measured current density and ω is the rotation rate, if j −1 changes linearly with ω−1/2, then the number of transferred electrons per O2 molecule can be determined from the slope of the interpolating straight line, when all other parameters are constant and known, (see SI for details). The potentials used for the K-L plots are: −0.06 V for N-MC-1, N-MC-2, N,S-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2; −0.11 V for MC and S-MC-1. The K-L plots show good linearity and this indicates a first-order dependence of the kinetics for the ORR on the doped MCs. The K-L slopes are very close to the theoretical values for the 2e− reduction mechanism, indicating a selectivity for the process leading to H2O2 (Table 4). The values of n, can be more careful determined by RRDE measurements. Fig. 7a reports the ring current recorded at RRDE for all the investigated electrodes. The ring electrode potential in acid electrolyte was set at 1.25 V for determining the H2O2 produced at the disk electrode. The ring and disk currents were of similar magnitude, indicating a remarkable production of H2O2. The electron number calculated from the formula: (5) n = 4 I d I d + I r / N where I d is the limiting disk current, I r is the limiting ring current, and N is the collection efficiency (0.25), shows that n ≈ 2.5 ± 0.1 within the range of −0.05 to −0.2 V for the all the doped MCs, with the exception of N,S-MC-2 at which an higher value was observed (Table 4). The resulting n values indicate that the two-electron process leading to hydrogen peroxide is the favored reduction mechanism. From the number of transferred electrons it is possible to determine the selectivity toward H2O2 production ( X H 2 O 2 ) [15] according to the following equation: (6) X H 2 O 2 % = 2 − n 2 · 100 The selectivity was found to be higher than 68% for the most part of the investigated materials (Table 4). To investigate the electrode kinetics under catalytic production of hydrogen peroxide EIS experiments were carried out at RDE in O2 saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 for all the prepared MCs. The potential was set at E 1/2 for each MCs with a superimposed perturbing signal of 5 mV; the EIS results are shown in Fig. 7f. The charge transfer resistance R ct, as measured by the diameter of the semicircle in the plot, is related to the charge transfer reaction kinetics according to the following Eq. (7) R c t = R T n F j 0 where j 0 is a kinetic parameter i.e. the exchange current, whereas the other terms of the equation assume the usual meaning. Considering that the semicircle in EIS curves represents the R ct ORR, it can be clearly seen from Fig. 7f that the corresponding R ct ORR in the case of N-MC-1, N-MC-2 and N,S-MC-1 are the smallest among the doped catalysts. This indicates that the ORR at nitrogen doped MCs is more favorable compared to the other S-doped MCs or the un-doped MC, due to the enhanced reaction kinetics. It is worth noting that the co-doped N,S-MC-2 has the highest R ct ORR, this is in good agreement with what already observed at RDE. In fact, even though the onset potential is not as negative as for MC, the current curve reported in Fig. 7b is stretched, indicating a kinetic hindrance possible arising from the deactivation of the electrode. We also investigated the electrocatalytic properties of all the doped mesoporous carbon materials for oxygen reduction in alkaline electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry at RRDE are reported in Fig. 8 . All the doped MCs and even MC show a reduction peak potential more positive with respect to C-MC, indicating the presence of a catalytic activity (Fig. 8a). However, the E p, E 1/2 and E onset are very similar for the different MCs with the only exception of N,S-MC-1 and N,S-MC-2 at which the ORR occurs at more negative values (Table 5 ). The observed catalytic activity are comparable to or even better than those of nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes reported in literature [64–67]. Fig. 8d shows, as a title of example, the LSV at RDE at different rotation rate for N-MC-1. The current shows the typical increase with rotation rate due to the thinner diffusion layer; the analysis of the plateau currents through K-L plots for the first step at E = −0.36 V and the second step at E = −0.96 V (Fig. 8e) show slopes coherent with a bi-electronic and tetra-electronic reduction process, respectively. The same behavior was confirmed for all the investigated materials. Therefore, it can be assumed that in alkaline environment the O2 is at first reduced to H2O2, and then further reduced in the second step, at far more negative potentials, to H2O. To confirm this mechanism H2O2 was purposely added into the solution and immediately after the LSV at RDE was acquired (Fig. 8f). It is clear that the addition of H2O2 causes the increases of the limiting current only of the second step, confirming the two steps mechanism. The RRDE analysis confirmed the “2 + 2” electron reduction mechanism for all the prepared MCs (Table 5). The ring electrode potential in alkaline media was set at 0.45 V for determining the H2O2 produced at the disk electrode, the ring current behavior is reported in Fig. 8b. It is clear that the ring current increases and then assumes a constant value nearby the first O2 reduction step, whereas at the second O2 reduction step the ring current decreases reaching an almost steady value. The number of electrons determined according to Eq. (5) is in agreement with the preferential production of H2O2 in the first step and H2O in the second one (Table 5). In particular N,S-MC-1, S-MC-1 and N-MC-1 show a plateau region of more than 300 mV between the reduction of O2 to H2O2 and the following reduction of H2O2 to H2O, suggesting the possibility to selectively stop the reduction process to H2O2 without further reduction to H2O. The selectivity toward H2O2 production (Eq. (7)) [15] was found to be higher than 70% for all MCs when the potential was set between −0.15 and −0.45 V (Table 5). Because ORR is an electron coupled proton reaction, the change in O2 reduction potential switching from acid to alkaline solution depends from a thermodynamic contribution due to H+ concentrations which involves a shift of almost 60 mV by unit of pH, and from a kinetic contribution which depends on the chemical and morphological nature of the catalyst. The morphological nature of the carbon such as pore dimension and ramification was recently appointed to be responsible for promoting the 2e− pathway to H2O2 [15], whereas the surface chemistry is responsible for the catalytic activity of the material [64]. Concerning the surface chemistry of the MCs prepared in this paper, it may be asserted that both nitrogen and oxygen functional groups are determinant for the catalytic activity, in particular in acidic environment. In fact, even MC shows to be active towards ORR, although to a lesser extent with respect to N-MC-1 and N-MC-2. In literature it is reported that the presence of quinone [65,68] and carboxyl groups [66] in the carbon material can promote ORR, at alkaline and acid pH, respectively. The commercial standard C-MC shows very similar O2 reduction potential notwithstanding the pH; on the contrary, the O2 reduction with the MCs prepared in this paper shows different performances, when the electrolyte is switched from acid to alkaline condition. In fact at low pH, all doped MCs show a peculiar catalytic activity, where the nitrogen functional groups seem to play a pivotal role in determining the catalytic effect, and this is confirmed by the dependence of E p with the nitrogen content. Conversely at high pH, the catalytic activity is still present, but the performances between each MCs becomes almost superimposable notwithstanding the content of nitrogen or sulfur dopant, indicating a possible deactivation of the effects promoted by the functional groups, (electron transfer mediation or electronic effect on the catalytic sites). With reference to N functional groups, we have shown that pyridinic and graphitic N are the most abundant ones in the doped material, but only the pyridinic groups, which lay at the step edges of the material, follows a pH chemistry and therefore we may speculate that protonation/deprotonation of the pyridinic N may switch on and off the nitrogen doping contribution to the whole catalytic effect, possibly by influencing the adsorption/desorption of O2 and its intermediates on the electrode surface. This may be in part explained on the basis of O2 reduction mechanism; in fact, according to what reported by McCreery [61], when O2 is not adsorbed on the electrode surface, the rate determining step (rds) is always the electron transfer (Eq. (8)), notwithstanding the pH, this would be the case of C-MC. (8) O 2 + e − ⇆ O 2 ads • − Conversely, when O2 is adsorbed on the electrode surface, it get more easily reduced to O2 •−, which in turn remains adsorbed on the electrode surface and can be protonated by H2O or H3O+. However, HO2 •−(ads) has a pKa higher than HO2 •−(aq) so that the protonation reaction is hindered at very basic pH (Eq. (9)) [61]. (9) O 2 ads • − + H 2 O ⇆ HO 2 ads • + OH − In conclusion doped MCs do not show different catalytic behavior at basic pH because in this case (pH > 12) reaction 9 is the rds, on the contrary at pH < 10 reaction 8 is the rds and a different catalytic behavior among each MCs can be observed."
10,Conclusions,"We successfully synthetized nitrogen and sulfur doped and co-doped MCs with high surface area and pore volume, starting from different molecular precursors. It was observed that there is the loss of the chemical imprinting of the molecular precursor when the material is pyrolyzed, so that the most thermodynamically stable pyridinic, N graphitic and thiophenic groups are found in the resulting material. A structural analysis, carried out by Raman spectroscopy, indicates that MCs contain both a graphitic and an amorphous component. Being the D1/G band ratio very similar for all MCs, we do not expect that reactivity differences among the MCs arise from their structure, in particular from differences in the edge plane defect density or in the size of nano-crystallites. The effect of heteroatoms on the catalytic activity of the carbon materials towards ORR was investigated and, notwithstanding the specific nature of the hetero-functional groups, it resulted that when the nitrogen content increases so does the catalytic activity, while the sulfur introduction in the carbon matrix leads to the opposite effect. The catalytic properties of MCs were investigated in both acid and alkaline solution. At acid pH the nitrogen doped MC results appreciably more active than sulfur doped or nitrogen-sulfur co-doped MCs. However, at high pH it is difficult to discriminate substantial differences in term of catalytic activity among differently doped MCs. We propose that at alkaline pH the electronic effect of pyridinic groups, (which are deprotonated) is deactivated, buffering the contribution of nitrogen doping in the whole catalytic effect. All the investigated MCs resulted to be active towards H2O2 production, in particular N doped materials show high selectivity towards the 2e− pathway. The selectivity towards H2O2 does not depend on the type or content of dopant heteroatom, therefore it is propable that the favorable mass transport inside mesopores involves a relatively short contact time, thus avoiding subsequent reactions to H2O."
