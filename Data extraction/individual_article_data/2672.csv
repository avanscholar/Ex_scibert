1,Combustion synthesis,"1.1 Combustion synthesis Recently, combustion synthesis techniques have gained attention for material synthesis on account of being an economical, fast, and energy efficient process. Combustion synthesis (CS) methods can be classified based on the way the combustion reaction takes place: The first method is known as self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) mode in which the reaction is ignited by an external source (heated coil, laser, etc.) and then the reaction front moves in a self sustained manner along the reaction media without requiring any additional energy. This is the preferred method to prepare solid forms but not powders. In the method known as volume combustion synthesis (VCS), the entire sample is preheated uniformly in a controlled manner until it reaches the ignition temperature and the reaction takes place simultaneously throughout the bulk of the media. These processes can be further categorized on the basis of physical nature of reaction mixture itself, such as: (1) flame synthesis or gas phase combustion, (2) heterogeneous condensed phase combustion synthesis and (3) solution combustion synthesis (SCS). A literature survey indicates that SCS based techniques have been used in the production of a wide variety of nano-materials suitable for different applications, e.g. pigment, catalysis, electronic and magnetic materials, drug delivery, etc. [1–3]. Typically, SCS involves a self-sustained reaction in a solution of metal nitrates and an oxygen containing fuel. The added fuel can be classified based on the chemical structure of the fuel, i.e. type of reactive groups (e.g. amino, hydroxyl, and carboxyl) bonded to a hydrocarbon chain. The reaction between the fuel, oxygen, and species formed during decomposition of nitrates provides conditions for rapid high-temperature propagating reacting front. The stoichiometric combustion reaction (utilizing metal nitrite as an oxidizer and glycine as a fuel, for example) can be described by the following widely accepted scheme: (1) M v ( N O 3 ) v + 5 9 v φ C H 2 N H 2 COOH + v 5 4 ( φ − 1 ) O 2 → M v O v / 2 ( s ) + 10 9 v φ C O 2 ( g ) + 25 18 v φ H 2 O ( g ) + v 5 φ + 9 18 N 2 ( g ) where M v is a v-valent metal. The parameter φ, fuel to oxidizer ratio, is defined such that φ =1 corresponds to a stoichiometric oxygen concentration, meaning that the initial mixture does not require atmospheric oxygen for complete oxidation of the fuel, while φ >1 (<1) implies fuel-rich (or lean) conditions. According to reaction (1) the final combustion product is a metal oxide. Recently some attempts were made to produce reduced metals instead of oxides using combustion synthesis techniques [4,5]. In a recent publication [5,6] we reported a reaction pathway describing the formation of pure metallic and bimetallic phase products during SCS and the proper combustion conditions required to form these reduced phases. A variation of SCS, referred as impregnated layer combustion synthesis (ILCS) was recently introduced by us [7] to control the metal oxides’ surface texture. In addition, a novel method referred as “second wave impregnation” was also proposed to control the dispersion of any catalyst on the surface of another catalyst or support [8]. The influence of different parameters on the nature of combustion was modeled and their effect on the surface structure was studied separately [9]. The enhancement of the surface area and elemental composition increased the activity and H2 selectivity in the partial oxidation of methanol. In this paper we use combustion synthesis techniques to prepare catalysts for hydrogen production from ethanol reforming reactions. SCS is energy efficient and less time consuming process in comparison to other techniques such as co-precipitation, which requires the separation of products after precipitation. Furthermore, in co-precipitation, these products are calcined separately, which leads to sintering and a decrease in the surface area. The potential advantage of CS is that it can yield oxides with larger surface areas than co-precipitated-calcined catalysts. Apart from its simplicity and rapidness, SCS has other advantages. The combustion reaction as described by Eq. (1) is exothermic, which in some cases can result in local temperatures as high as 1000°C that can provide enough energy to evaporate volatile impurities as well as for calcination of the product. Thus a pure crystalline product is obtained in a single step avoiding any other thermal treatment. Also, as seen in Eq. (1) all other products, except the metal oxide, are gas phase products which form channels while escaping, contributing towards the porosity of the solid products and potentially to a higher surface area. A brief literature review of the catalysts studied for ethanol reforming reactions is presented in the next section to illustrate the catalysts’ selection process in the multi-component metal catalyst developed."
2,Ethanol reforming,"1.2 Ethanol reforming Fuel cells are a potentially promising technology for efficient and clean power generation and it has received a great deal of research interest in the past decade but its origin goes back to a century. Fuel cells require hydrogen to produce electricity, which has lead to study hydrogen abstraction from various hydrogen containing resources. Light alcohols produced from biomass, such as methanol, ethanol, etc., are a carbon neutral source of hydrogen and they are available as commodity chemicals. In previous works we studied hydrogen abstraction from methanol [8,10–12] using copper, zinc, zirconia based catalysts prepared by combustion synthesis techniques. In the present work we report results obtained using ethanol as a source of hydrogen. Ethanol is a renewable resource, which can be obtained from biomass by fermentation. Recently there have been some major accomplishments in the development of techniques for ethanol production from corn stover [13] and other biomass products [14]. Hydrogen can be generated from ethanol mainly by three reaction pathways: ethanol steam reforming (ESR), ethanol partial oxidation (EPOx), and ethanol decomposition (ED) as shown in the following schemes: (2) C2H5OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2 (3) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 2 O 2 → 2 C O 2 + 3 H 2 (4) C2H5OH→CH3CHO+H2 (5) C2H5OH→CH4 +CO+H2 Catalyst used in recent years for the ethanol steam reforming reactions (ESR-reaction (2)) includes supported Ni [15–22], Ni–Cu [15,17,21,22], noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh [23–27], and oxides such as Co [23–30], and MoO3 [31]. Supports such as Al2O3, SiO2, La2O3, CeO2, TiO2, ZrO2 and ZnO are reported to play important roles in the reaction chemistry. The activity of Co in presence of various supports was examined by Haga et al. [28] and these authors found that hydrogen selectivity decreases in following order: Co/Al2O3 >Co/ZrO2 >Co/MgO>Co/SiO2, and Co/C, showing that the properties of Co catalysts were greatly affected by the nature of the supports. Co/Al2O3 exhibits the highest selectivity (∼67%) for steam reforming of ethanol by suppressing – the methanation of CO and decomposition of ethanol. Haga et al. [32,33] also studied the activity of supported transition metal catalysts for ethanol steam reforming (ESR) and the effect of the particle size and the nature of the support. These authors found that the selectivity for CO x production was in the reverse order of crystallite size of Co particles [32], and that hydrogen selectivity for alumina supported catalysts decreased in the order Co>Ni>Rh>Pt, Ru, Cu [33]. Ethanol partial oxidation (E-POx-reaction (3)) is an exothermic reaction (ΔH 298K =−554kJ/mol), suitable for hydrogen production at low temperature. As in ESR, Ni is an active catalyst for E-POx reaction. Ni in presence of Fe is active at low temperatures, ranging 200–300°C [34] with ethanol conversion up to 86% and maximum hydrogen selectivity of 46% for a catalyst with an equimolar ratio of Ni and Fe. The performance of Pt/Al2O3, Pt/ZnO, and Pt/ZrO2 [35] were found to be sensitive to the crystallite size of dispersed Pt particles. Pt and Rh supported on CeO2 were studied by Silva et al. [36] using DRIFTS. Adsorption of ethanol on Pt/CeO2 gives rise to ethoxy species, which can be decomposed to produce CH4, H2 and CO, and dehydrogenated to form acetaldehyde. On the other hand, Rh-based catalyst can dehydrogenate the ethoxy species to a cyclic intermediate (oxametallacycle), – that dissociates to CO, CH x and C x , which are further oxidized to CO2. Supported noble metals such as Ru supported on a monolith [37], Ir/CeO2 [38] and Pt supported on Al2O3, ZrO2 and CeO2 has also been studied [39]. The activity of Cu and Cr oxides supported on γ-Al2O3 [40,41] was evaluated and it was found that Cu is more selective for hydrogen while Cr is selective for acetaldehyde and CO. Ethanol decomposition (ED, reactions (4) and (5)) is another reaction pathway for hydrogen generation from ethanol. Relatively less literature is available for this reaction as compared to ethanol steam reforming and partial oxidation. Xu et al. [42] reports that decomposition of ethanol over Ni(111) proceeds by O–H bond cleavage and formation of ethoxy species on the catalytic surface. Ethanol desorption and decomposition studies on a Rh(111) surface show that ethanol decomposition occurs simultaneously with ethanol desorption. The decomposed ethanol leaves H and CO on the surface which desorbs at higher temperature to produce H2 and CO. Catalytic decomposition of ethanol on a Cu/Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst was investigated at temperatures between 150–400°C and atmospheric pressure [43]. Catalytic generation of H2 starts at 200–300°C along with the formation of aldehyde. Ethanol conversion of 60% was observed at 400°C. These authors also reported that Cu/Al LDH undergoes some physical modification and produce highly dispersed metallic Cu, which could be the active phase in this catalyst. Ir(111) [44] has also been reported to be active for ethanol decomposition. The activity of supported Pd catalysts such as: Pd/ZnO, Pd/Ga2O3, Pd/In2O3, Pd/MgO, Pd/SiO2, Pd/Al2O3, Pd-black along with Cu/Zn [45], were studied for the decomposition reaction. The activities of such supported Pd catalysts were greatly modified upon the formation of Pd alloy phases. Over Pd–Zn, Pd–Ga and Pd–In alloys, acetaldehyde was selectively produced at lower conversion levels. As conversion increased, ethyl acetate was produced at the expense of acetaldehyde. The selectivity for the ethyl acetate formation exceeded that of acetaldehyde over a Cu/ZnO catalyst. On metallic Pd, the decomposition of ethanol occurred to a considerable extent. The main problem associated with the ethanol decomposition reaction on this catalyst, however, was the formation of coke at high temperatures. Based on the above literature survey it is clear that, excluding noble metals, Ni, Fe and Cu are the most frequently studied active elements for ethanol reforming reactions. On this basis, these three elements were selected to be synthesized by CS to form a multi-component catalyst for the E-POx and ethanol decomposition reactions. Zn was also used as an additional promoter. We excluded the noble metals from this study because of their high cost and low hydrogen selectivity at low temperature."
3,Experimental,
4,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis Aqueous solutions of metal nitrates (Alfa Aesar) M v (NO3) v ·xH2O (where M=Ni, Cu, Fe and x =crystalline water) and glycine (C2H5NO2, as fuel) were used to synthesize catalysts in volume combustion synthesis (VCS) mode. The amount of precursor materials were calculated based on the production of 3g of the final catalyst. These precursors were dissolved in 75ml of deionized water in a beaker of 400ml capacity. The stoichiometric reaction, as shown in Eq. (1), is expected to take place during the combustion process to yield the metal oxide. In the VCS method the homogeneous solution of metal nitrates and fuel is heated over a hot plate until it reaches the ignition temperature. Once ignited, the reaction can proceed very fast, which can lead to either an explosive combustion mode or to the SHS mode inside the beaker itself. Based on previous experience and modeling studies [9] we have learned how to control the reaction in VCS so that it proceeds in the SHS-like mode. After synthesis, the resulting powders were milled using a planetary ball mill (Retsch PM 100) at 650rpm for two minutes to get a mixture with uniform particle size. The catalysts prepared are named according to their compositions. The metal/metal-oxides Ni x , Fe y , Cu z and Zn l are given in their respective metal molar ratios x, y, z and l. The fuel/oxidizer ratio φ, has been maintained at 1.75, which is the optimized value obtained from our previous studies [5] for the production of pure metals using combustion synthesis. A high-speed IR thermography (IRT) camera (FLIR SC6000 HS) and a conventional Digital Video Camera (SONY) were used to visualize the combustion process and to measure the temperature-time history of the reacting mixture. The FLIR SC6000 HS can give a spatial resolution up to 1.5μ and the maximum frame rate can go as high as 36kHz, which is required to get precise thermal mapping of the combustion process."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area and phase composition of the as-synthesized catalyst powders were measured using BET, and XRD methods, while their morphology was imaged by high resolution SEM. BET surface area measurements were carried on a Quantachrome monosorb unit, using nitrogen as the adsorbent gas. The weight of the sample, outgassed at 473K for two hours, was precisely measured before using it in the calculations of the specific surface area. XRD measurements were carried out in air at room temperature using a X-ray diffractometer (Scintag Inc.) using Cu-Kα radiation of 1.54056Å wavelength. Powder microstructures were imaged using a field emission SEM (Magellan 400 FEI) at Notre Dame Integrated Imaging Facility offering ultra high resolution and a magnification up to 2500k×."
6,Activity measurements,"2.3 Activity measurements The activity and selectivity of catalysts containing different molar ratios of Ni, Fe, and Cu, prepared using the VCS method described earlier, were measured in two types of reactors towards ethanol partial oxidation and decomposition reactions. We first used a high throughput reactor containing ten channels, which allowed us to investigate ten catalysts in a single run at a single temperature and flow rate. The most active and hydrogen selective catalyst from this multiple channel reactor was selected for detailed analysis in a single quartz tubular reactor with an internal diameter of 10.5mm and total length of 30cm. In each experiment, the freshly prepared catalysts from as-synthesized milled powders were pressed to 35MPa for 4min to form a pellet. The resulting pellet was broken up and sieved to obtain a particle size between 0.6 and 1mm. 200mg of each catalyst was used in the multiple channel reactor for activity measurements while 400mg were used in single reactor measurements. Each catalyst was reduced in situ by heating it from room temperature to 573K at a rate of 5Kmin−1, and held at this temperature for one hour under a pure hydrogen flow rate of 50cm3/min. After reduction, the flow was switched from hydrogen to nitrogen to purge out any remaining hydrogen, and then the reactor was cooled down to room temperature for about 30min. Then the feed was introduced at a flow rate of 45cm3/min of nitrogen saturated with ethanol (ethanol bubbler kept at room temperature), resulting in a stream containing 2.2cm3/min of ethanol. Oxygen was then added to the reactant stream at a flow rate of to obtain an O2/CH3CH2OH ratio of 1.5. Two gas chromatographs (GC) were connected in parallel to analyze on line the reactor effluents. The first GC (Varian 3300) has a 3.7m HAYESEP Q column for separation and detection of carbon dioxide, ethanol, water, methane, ethane and acetaldehyde. The second GC (Varian 920) has a 1.8m molecular sieve 5Å and a 5.0m HAYESEP D connected in series to separate nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. Product gases were measured in 12min intervals while the catalyst bed was being heated continuously from room temperature to 723K over the course of 3h and 30min. Selectivity of products (hydrogen, methane, ethane, acetaldehyde, CO2, etc.) was defined as the amount (moles) of desired product obtained to the maximum amount that could have been obtained at given conversion of ethanol."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst synthesis,"3.1 Catalyst synthesis The catalyst precursors (metal nitrates and glycine) were dissolved in water to make a uniformly homogeneous solution. This solution was then heated over a hot plate to start the reaction. Once ignited, the reaction combustion front moves in a self sustained way, without requiring additional energy. Fig. 1 shows the movement of the combustion front inside the beaker using the SONY camera. Fig. 2 gives the average temperature inside the beaker as a function of time as recorded by FLIR-SC6000 system. The maximum temperature inside the beaker (black line) shows the presence of multiple peaks before self propagation starts. These peaks indicate the presence of local hot spots (local ignition points) which could not propagate and got quenched because the surrounding areas were not preheated enough to carry the reaction further. As preheating continues, conditions are reached in which SHS regime is established in most of the volume without causing an explosive behavior. As previously reported [8], the products obtained after combustion are crystalline in nature and require no further calcination to obtain crystalline purity. This is one of the main advantages of the CS method since avoiding additional calcination prevents sintering that can occurs during this process. To make the product physically uniform, however, the powders were milled for 2min using a milling ball to sample ratio of 2:1 and rotation speed 650rpm. Table 1 gives the summary of different solutions compositions used to prepare different catalysts composition to be studied for the ethanol partial oxidation reaction."
9,Catalyst parallel activity evaluation and characterization,"3.2 Catalyst parallel activity evaluation and characterization The activity and selectivity of 200mg of catalysts containing different ratios of Ni, Fe and Cu, was evaluated first in the 10 channel parallel reactor. Prior to the oxidation experiment, the catalysts were reduced in a hydrogen–nitrogen stream (1:2 molar ratio, total flow=150cm3/min) while the temperature was ramped from room temperature to 300°C in one hour and was maintained at this level for another hour. The reducing gas flow was equally divided into ten channels and was maintained constant throughout the reduction process. After reduction, the hydrogen flow was turned off while nitrogen was kept flowing for another hour to sweep out the residual hydrogen. Ethanol was then introduced by flowing nitrogen gas through an ethanol bubbler kept at 0°C. A flow rate of 144 cm3/min of nitrogen was maintained resulting in a stream containing 1.54% ethanol. Oxygen flow was adjusted to get the oxygen to ethanol ratio to the stoichiometric value of 1.5. The reactor was held at 335°C throughout the experiment in the multiple channel reactor. The effluent gases from one channel, selected via a 10 port multiposition valve, were directed to the GC sample valve for analysis whereas the flows of the other channels were sent to a vent. The ethanol activity and hydrogen selectivity results are shown in Fig. 3 . As it can be seen, among the catalysts containing Ni, Fe and Cu, the ethanol partial oxidation activity and selectivity is the highest for Ni1Fe0.5Cu1. While the specific role of the individual metals in the activity and selectivity cannot be determined at this stage of the work, a qualitative trend emerges when comparing the molar ratio of these components. Ni1Fe1Cu0.5 gives a conversion of 82% at the operating temperature of 335°C, reducing the amount of Ni and increasing Cu content decreases the activity somewhat, but it gives a better hydrogen selectivity, whereas decreasing the amount of Fe with an increase in Cu gives 94% activity and is the most selective composition among the catalysts investigated. In our previous studies [8,10–12], as well as in the literature, we found that addition of zinc to copper increased the hydrogen selectivity during methanol partial oxidation and the optimum ratio of Cu/Zn was found to be 7/3 [12]. On that basis Zn was added along with Cu in the same 7/3 ratio to observe if it has a similar effect in ethanol oxidation. Comparing Ni1Fe1Cu1 and Ni1Fe1(Cu7Zn3)1 one can see that there is a small improvement in ethanol conversion but the hydrogen selectivity decreases. Whereas reducing the amount of Cu/Zn as in Ni1Fe1(Cu7Zn3)0.5 increases the ethanol conversion to 95% and selectivity to 0.7% as compared to a value of 0.5% in Ni1Fe1(Cu7Zn3)1. Due to their high activity and hydrogen selectivity Ni1Fe0.5Cu1 catalyst was selected for further study in a single reactor. 400mg of catalyst was used in a single reactor. The catalysts were reduced in the same way as described earlier in the experimental section. Fig. 4 shows the results of ethanol partial oxidation on Ni1Fe0.5Cu1 catalyst with oxygen/EtOH ratio of 1.5. Ethanol conversion reaches 50% at 240°C and 100% at ∼380°C, hydrogen production starts at 320°C and reaches 40% at 400°C. Other products observed are CH3CHO, CO2, CH4, C2H6 and some CO as well. Acetaldehyde selectivity initially increases with temperature, reaches a maximum value of 66% at 257°C and then decreases with temperature showing 0% selectivity at 360°C. CO2 production starts at 180°C and increases gradually with temperature showing a maximum value of 95% above 400°C. Methane production starts at ∼340°C and remains below 30%. A nearly horizontal plateau is observed from 300 to 340°C in the ethanol activity curve as well as in CO2 and acetaldehyde selectivities. Hydrogen production also starts in the same temperature range suggesting a possible change in ethanol decomposition pathway. Decrease in acetaldehyde concentration indicates its decomposition to produce hydrogen. In the absence of oxygen, i.e. for ethanol decomposition, shown in Fig. 5 , 50% conversion is achieved at ∼230°C while the temperatures required for 100% conversion is 400°C. Without oxygen, hydrogen generation started at 130°C reaching 41% selectivity at 400°C, while acetaldehyde showed a maximum value of 75% at 255°C before decreasing to 0% at 400°C. CO2 selectivity is much lower in the absence of oxygen starting at 290°C and reaching a maximum value of 17% at 420°C. Methane production started at 220°C and gradually increases with temperature giving a maximum value of 50% at 440°C. Comparing these results with ethanol partial oxidation it is clear that ethanol decomposition is more selective for hydrogen production at low temperature and methane production at higher temperatures while partial oxidation is more selective for CO2 formation. The horizontal plateau observed in the ethanol decomposition reaction is much wider and it showed some drop in activity as well, indicating some deactivation of the catalyst in that temperature range. Carbon formation, observed in the spent catalyst, could be one reason for possible deactivation during the decomposition reaction. These carbon residues could cause the deactivation of the catalyst by blocking access to the active sites. This effect was reduced in the presence of oxygen possibly because of conversion of these carbon species to carbon dioxide. Interestingly, no decrease in activity was detected in these short runs possibly due to the formation of carbon filaments, which maintained the activity but could cause deactivation in runs at longer time on stream [46]. A literature survey shows that Ni50Fe50 [34], Cu/Zn/Ni [54], Ni48Fe48La4 [55], Pt/Al2O3 [41], Pt/CeO2 [39], Rh/CeO2 [23] and Pt on Al2O3, ZrO2 and ZnO [35] are among the catalysts studied for ethanol partial oxidation reaction. These catalysts were also active at low temperature and showed similar order of hydrogen selectivity than the catalyst reported in this work. However, except for Ni, Cu, and Fe, expensive rare earth metals or noble metals such as Pt, Rh were used. In the case of Fe, Ni, and Cu the time-consuming co-precipitation method was used to prepare them whereas we used the more efficient CS method with slightly better activity and selectivity results. To realize the role of individual metal components, activity and selectivity experiments were conducted on individual Cu, Ni and Fe phases prepared by combustion synthesis. A short summary of these results is given in Table 2 . Fig. 6 shows the catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity results on these catalysts. Ni shows highest activity among the three and gives 50% conversion at 233°C and 100% conversion at 300°C. Cu gives 50% conversion at 265°C followed by Fe, which requires up to 309°C to give similar conversion. Ni seems to be more hydrogen selective at low temperature (<220°C) while Fe becomes more hydrogen selective for temperatures above 270°C. Looking at the acetaldehyde selectivity, it is clear that Cu is the most selective among all the metals and gives ∼96% acetaldehyde selectivity at 300°C followed by Fe and Ni giving maximum values of 47% at 290°C and 14% at 50°C, respectively. However for CO2, Fe is the most selective among the three followed by Ni and Cu. Cu is almost non-selective for CO2. Ni is the only metal with observable selectivity for CH4 and gives ∼50% selectivity at 300°C while Fe is the most selective for C2H6 giving a maximum of 10% at 380°C. In summary Ni is most active at lower temperature and selective for hydrogen and methane, Cu is more selective for acetaldehyde and Fe is selective for CO2, ethane as well as for hydrogen at high temperature (Fig. 7 ). A stability analysis was conducted by measuring ethanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity at different time on stream (TOS). Conversion and selectivity remains fairly constant at 350°C. At 400°C, ethanol conversion remains constant all the time at 100% however the hydrogen selectivity, initially at ∼50% decreased to ∼45% in 3h and to ∼20% after 15h of TOS. The reason for this behavior could be the formation of carbon observed at temperatures above 400°C. Similar behavior could be seen in Fig. 5 (for ethanol decomposition reaction) where a plateau in conversion is observed close to 400°C temperature presumably due to carbon blocking the active sites. XPS studies done on Cu [47] suggest that alcohol decomposition proceeds through alkoxy intermediate formation by O–H bond cleavage. The alkoxy species undergo further decomposition to form aldehydes and hydrogen, while some recombination to alcohol formation was also observed on the Cu surface. On the other hand, on Ni sites, ethoxy species are relatively unstable and reactive intermediates decompose readily by breaking sequentially C–H and C–C bonds to form acetaldehyde, methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and surface carbon [48]. IRAS studies on Ni(111) [42] indicate that during ethanol decomposition, after formation of ethoxy species, the methyl group reorients itself causing the direction of C–C bond to become parallel to the surface. It has also been reported that the presence of Ni helps to segregate Cu to the surface of Cu–Ni catalysts [15], which forms more stable ethoxy species while Ni promotes C–C bond scission. Stable alkoxy intermediates have also been observed by Benziger and Madix [49] on iron surfaces with CO and H2 as the main decomposition products and lesser amount of acetaldehyde and alkane formation. This ethoxy intermediate on Fe has also been observed in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. Differences in the catalytic behavior of Ni and Fe can be observed by the fact that CO hydrogenation over Ni produces mainly methane whereas on Fe it produces mainly alcohols and long chain hydrocarbons [50,51]. Applying the above discussion to the results obtained in our laboratory, one can speculate about a possible role of each element in our catalysts during ethanol reforming (see Fig. 8 ). Cu and Fe form stable ethoxy adsorbate on the surface while Ni breaks the C–H and C–C bonds to form hydrogen, methane and CO. The presence of Ni somehow prevents Fe from forming long chain alkanes by the Fischer–Tropsch reaction and decreases the selectivity of acetaldehyde formed due to the presence of Cu. To confirm this hypothesis, further work is being conducted to obtain information about the oxidation states of the individual metals under reaction conditions (operando) and the reaction intermediates formed, using in situ EXAFS and FTIR studies. Ex-situ XRD pattern of the as synthesized Ni1Fe0.5Cu1 catalyst (not shown) indicates that Ni, Fe and Cu components are present as spinel NiFe2O4 and CuNi alloys. The presence of NiFe2O4 was also reported by Wang et al. [34], and these authors speculate that NiFe2O4 and FeNi3 could be the active sites for the ethanol partial oxidation reaction. The presence of Ni helps Cu to be in a reduced phase as compared to the CuO phase, and the reduced Cu could also contribute towards the high activity and selectivity of such multi-component catalyst. XRD results were obtained in air which is quite different than under reaction conditions and thus cannot be related to active sites. The elucidation of the role of each metal will be further clarified by operando EXAFS results now underway. The presence of metallic phases is an important factor in the activity and selectivity, and if so, increasing the oxides surface area and its reducibility increases the number of active sites. Due to the vigorous nature of the combustion synthesis reaction and the evolution of large amount of gas phase products (see Eq. (1)), this method produces a unique surface morphology. The gases evolved during the combustion synthesis reaction, form channels in the resulting solid product and hence the product is porous in nature as shown in SEM images (Fig. 9 ). High magnification images show the presence of particles smaller than 500nm agglomerated together forming a micro-porous structure. From SEM it is possible to estimate the crystallites ranging from 20 to 200nm, by assuming that the features observed correspond to different phases. Crystallite size calculations from XRD using Scherrer's equation indicate presence of Cu crystallites in the range of 40–75nm with an average value of 60nm. While we expected higher surface areas, sintering still occurred and surface areas of 10–30m2/g were achieved (Table 1). However, due to the complexity of the catalysts, there could be a distribution of active sites that is not necessarily proportional to the surface area. Sintering, which leads to low surface area can be alleviated by adding some salt (e.g. NaCl, KCl, etc.) in the solution [52,53]. These salts precipitate during combustion and cover the catalyst nanoparticles formed during reaction and stop them from sintering. The salt particles can be leached out after combustion. This way the catalyst can be synthesized without allowing the nanoparticles to sinter. Another route to further increase surface area is to use a high area support and impregnate the active solution onto it. Work is underway to study this route for increasing the surface area using CS. These individual particles in the pores of the catalysts provide active sites for the reaction to take place. It can be seeing that the surfaces are covered with what appears to be different micro phases, the composition of which cannot be easily determined. It is likely that several phases might be present and that their composition might change during reaction as the reactants composition and temperature changes. Further studies are underway to clarify these issues; however, we can summarize our present results as below."
10,Summary,"Ni, Fe, and Cu based catalysts were synthesized in different molar ratios using solution combustion synthesis technique. The catalysts thus synthesized were porous compared to bulk powders and have surface areas ranging from 15 to 30m2/g. These catalysts were tested for their activity and selectivity towards ethanol partial oxidation reaction. Ni1Fe0.5Cu1 was selected based on its activity and hydrogen selectivity for detailed studies. It was found that these catalysts are active and hydrogen selective for the ethanol decomposition reaction. Carbon formation was observed at high temperature, which slightly affects the catalyst performance. Adding oxygen to the feed reduces carbon content but it also decreases the hydrogen selectivity. Ni was found to be most active at lower temperature and selective for hydrogen and methane, Cu was selective for acetaldehyde and Fe was selective for CO2 and ethane. Hydrogen selectivity was found to be highest for Fe at high temperature. The ethanol decomposition reaction appears to proceed through the formation of alkoxy species that decompose at higher temperatures. Further work is underway – to understand the mechanism of ethanol decomposition and partial oxidation as well as the role of different metals used in this work."
