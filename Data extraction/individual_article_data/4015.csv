0,Introduction,"Diesel Engine plays a major role in many fields such as Agriculture, Marine transport, Automobile transport and Air transport. It also used in the generation of power because of their better fuel economy and higher efficiency [1]. In spite of their preferable advantages, they are one of the major pollution contributors to the environment. Primary pollutants emitted from diesel engines are particulate matters (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Increasing stringent regulation on exhaust emissions drives a major research endeavor in engine development in order to reduce these pollutants [2]. Therefore, energy conservation with high efficiency and low emission are important research topics for development of engine system [3]. According to the literature, the use of renewable alternative fuels is one of the suitable methods [4,5]. Recently, developing and seeking alternative diesel fuels, without modifying engines, has become an important issue. Also, using renewable fuels can give the chance for many countries to reduce their dependence on imported oil [6]. Among all the alternative fuels, biodiesel and alcohols and their blends with diesel are suitable alternatives to diesel fuel for diesel engines [7,8]. Biodiesel is a renewable energy source and has similar characteristics to diesel fuel and in proper ratios, it can improve diesel engine performance in different operating conditions and modes. Biodiesel has similar combustion features to those of diesel but the former causes less air pollution and has a weaker greenhouse effect [9]. Biodiesel can be obtained from variety of feedstock’s like vegetable oils (edible or non-edible), animal wastes, and sewage sludge and is synthesized usually via transesterification with low-molecular-weight alcohols [10,11]. The current mandates regarding the use of biodiesel around the world are mostly based on a biodiesel–diesel blend. Many studies of biodiesel have shown that the use of fuels that contain appropriate percentages of biodiesel can reduce the amounts of pollutants that are emitted from diesel engines. It has been reported by most researchers that biodiesel contains 10–12% oxygen in weight basis and that reduces both HC and CO compared to diesel in the same engine under the same conditions and that mainly due to the effect of complete combustion [12–14]. Since biodiesel contains little sulphur compared to the diesel fuel, a significant reduction in SO2 emission was obtained [15]. However, generally, biodiesel fuels could significantly reduce the HC, CO and smoke emissions but have an adverse effect on NOx emissions [16–17]. Palash et al. [18] analyzed the impacts of biodiesel fuels on NOx emissions and their reduction approaches. They concluded that biodiesel and its blends have strong beneficial impacts on HC, CO and PM emissions but adverse effects on NOx emissions due to the higher temperatures of the combustion chamber and the presence of fuel oxygen. Based on the foregoing, reducing NOx emissions involves a combination of fuel research and engine technology research. So, it is necessary to be concerned about engine performance fueled by biodiesel when applying different emission reduction technologies. The need to control emissions and improve performance of an engine at the same time leads the author in this research to look into a suitable biodiesel blend with an additive as solutions for meeting the tougher future standards for NOx without sacrificing the other benefits of the biodiesel. In Egypt, there were some studies reported the results of diesel oil directly blended with crude jojoba oil and jojoba methyl ester (JME) for running in diesel engines [19–22]. Jojoba oil was chosen as it is non edible oil and the vast area of the Egyptian deserts can be used for production the seeds are used to produce the oil. High viscosity and low volatility of the jojoba biodiesel have been reported in previous studies [21,23]. The results showed that the NOx emissions with the JME-diesel blends were higher than that with diesel fuel and increased in a linear fashion with increasing blend fraction of JME [19]. An experimental study on diesel engine nitrogen oxide reduction running with jojoba methyl ester has been reported by Saleh [24] to quantify the efficiency of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in a fully instrumented, two-cylinder, naturally aspirated, four stroke direct injection diesel engine. The literature reveals that the biodiesel can be mixed with other fuels to form binary or ternary blended fuels to improve some fuel properties of the original fuels [19,25–27]. Whereas butanol was regarded as one of the promising alternative fuels or oxygen additives for diesel engines as oxygen content of butanol is 21.6%. Butanol can be considered as an alternative due to its advantages of high heating value, high cetane number, low vapor pressure and good miscibility with respect to ethanol [28–30]. Also a use of butanol in diesohol solved the problem of fuel instability at low temperatures because of its higher solubility in diesel fuel [31]. Furthermore, butanol can be produced by anaerobic fermentation of crude glycerol which is the main co-product of the tranesterification reaction of biodiesel production [32]. Hence, the effect of various blending n-butanol ratios in diesel-jojoba oil-butanol has been used for analysis in this research project. Several technologies such as using additives into fuel, exhaust gas recirculation, water injection, emulsion technology, injection timing retardation, simultaneous technology and low temperature combustion mode are used to reduce NOx emissions from diesel engines. Studies on the emulsified fuel technology as a method for reducing nitrogen oxides and particulate matter simultaneously has been proven at relatively low cost compared to other pollution-reducing strategies as no engine modification is required to use the emulsified fuel directly in the cylinder [33–34]. The limiting factor for water emulsions is the delivery capacity of the injection system. If emulsions are to be used without engine modifications, the maximum quantity of water and the degree of NOx reduction are both limited to some 10–20% [35]. Water emulsified fuels improve the combustion efficiency and the brake thermal efficiency and reduce the formation of NOx, soot, HC, and particulate matter. Faster combustion reaction takes place in the water emulsified fuels due to the formation of micro explosion phenomenon. Micro-explosion is the secondary atomization caused by the rapid evaporation of dispersed water in emulsified fuel droplets [36]. Recently, jojoba biodiesel emulsified with hydrogen peroxide or water has not been reported as yet. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizer that release oxygen during reaction and will initiate or sustain a combustion process quite readily. Also, adding hydrogen peroxide into fuel–air combustion will reduce the ignition delay of the fuel, improving the combustion itself [37–39]. Nagaprasad et al. [37] found higher engine break thermal efficiency with increased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. NOx emissions were lower as a result of a lower average cycle temperature with addition of hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, the study of hydrogen peroxide effects on diesel-jojoba-butanol blends is a need to sustain the utilization of fuel source for the future energy requirement. The main objectives of the research work were firstly to clarify the effect of the n-butanol content in the diesel-jojoba fuel blends on performance and the emissions characteristics. Biodiesel of jojoba with ratio of 5% by volume has been utilized while the percentage of n-butanol was varied. The best blend of diesel-jojoba-butanol as substitution of the diesel fuel with maintaining high thermal efficiency of a conventional engine under various conditions of load at rated engine speed of 1500 rpm was determined. Secondly improve the engine performance and emissions of the best selected blend from the first section were investigated. The solution for reducing NOx emissions by adding hydrogen peroxide or water in the ratios of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% to the best selected blend has been carried out at two loads and a constant speed of 1500 rpm. All experiments described were performed on a direct injection diesel engine without any modification. In each test, volumetric fuel consumption and exhaust regulated gas emissions, such NOx, CO, and HC are measured."
1,The blended fuels and experimental apparatus,
2,Characteristics of diesel-jojoba-butanol blends,"2.1 Characteristics of diesel-jojoba-butanol blends To optimize the performance of the diesel-jojoba-butanol blends, it is very important to know the change in the physical properties of those fuels with change the amount of butanol in the blend. So, the effect of butanol addition to diesel-jojoba blend on the kinematic viscosity, heating value and density of blends at 40 0C is shown in Fig. 1 . The diesel-jojoba-butanol blends were performed using blends of diesel fuel compatible with ASTM D975 and jojoba biodiesel compatible with ASTM D6751 [40]. Table 1 shows the properties of diesel fuel, jojoba oil versus butanol. The main properties of the diesel-jojoba-butanol blends used are summarized in the Table 2 . The blended fuel is denoted as, “DJ5BX” with “X” representing the percentage of butanol contained in the blend (i.e DJ5B5 is 90% diesel fuel, 5% raw jojoba oil and 5% butanol). Biodiesel of raw jojoba is with ratio of 5% by volume in the blend due to its extremely high viscosity compared to the viscosity of diesel fuel. The viscosity of DJ5 blend is higher than standard diesel fuel (1.8–4.1 cSt) about 48.6%. From Fig. 1, it is clear that the viscosity of the DJ5 blend decreases rapidly with increasing butanol addition. DJ5B10 blend yielded a 20.9% lower viscosity and about 35.6% with DJ5B25 than diesel-jojoba blend. Also increasing the percentage volume of butanol in the blend by 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% decrease the density about 1.4%, 2%, 2.6%, 2.8% and 3.2% relative to diesel-jojoba blend respectively. Both density and viscosity properties are affected by butanol content, which will directly affect the atomization characteristic of the fuel droplet once injected into the cylinder. According to Ejim el. al. [41], the physical properties of a liquid fuel that affect its atomization in a diesel engine are viscosity, density and surface tension. So it was expected that, the ignition quality, engine performance and exhaust emissions are different between diesel-jojoba-butanol blends and diesel fuel. Also, the properties of emulsified selected blend (DJ5B8) as fuel in the second section of the results are given in Table 3 . Stable emulsion can be made with adding 1.0% of Span 80 as an emulsifier and by using mechanical stirrer equipment. Hydrogen peroxide or water contents with Span 80 of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% by volume in the emulsion were used in this study."
3,Experimental facilities,"2.2 Experimental facilities In order to study the influences of the butanol in the diesel-jojoba fuel blends on performance and the emissions characteristics, a single-cylinder, four stroke, air cooled, naturally aspirated direct injection diesel engine was used in the experiments. The schematic of the experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 2 . The engine was coupled to an electrical generator through which load was applied by increasing the field voltage. Tests were held on a laboratory test bench which consists of an electrical generator, a liquid fuel and air metering systems, an exhaust gases analysis system and engine mounting elements. Kistler piezoelectric pressure transducer is installed in the cylinder head for measuring combustion parameters like the cylinder pressure and ignition delay period. The engine fuel system was modified by adding a new fuel tank was fixed to the system for diesel-Jojoba oil-butanol blends with two hand operated control valves which allowed rapid switching between the standard diesel fuel and the tested fuel. When the engine was under diesel operation, valve one (V1) was open and valve two (V2) was closed, and when the engine was under blended fuel operation, (V1) was closed and (V2) opened as shown in Fig. 2. Before running the engine with a new blended fuel, it was allowed to run for sufficient time to consume the remaining fuel from the previous experiment. The flow rate of air into the engine was measured using an air box, a flow meter and a manometer. The fuel consumption was measured by the use of a 50 cc graduated burette and stopwatch. The air temperature, lubricating oil and exhaust gas temperature were measured using type K thermocouples. Exhaust emission values of NOx, CO and HC were obtained with Horiba model MEXA-584 gas analyzer. The engine specifications are given in Table 4 ."
4,Experimental procedure and test cases examined,"The experiments were conducted at five load levels corresponding to 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of full load and engine speed of 1500 rpm under both diesel fuel and diesel-jojoba-butanol blended fuel operation. The air inlet temperature was 33 °C for all cases examined. Experiments have been conducted after the engine was warmed-up at low idle long enough to establish the oil temperature at 60 °C; and was checked for any fuel, oil, and air leaks. The speed was then increased to 1500 rpm and sufficient load was applied to raise the cooling water temperature to 70 °C. After completion of the warm-up procedure, the engine was operated on diesel fuel first in order to determine the engine’s operating characteristics and exhaust emission levels, constituting the baseline that is compared with the corresponding cases when using diesel-jojoba-butanol blends. After each test, the engine was run about 10 min at idle speed to replace the test fuel in the system and the same procedure was repeated at engine speed of 1500 rpm under different loads. Exhaust gas analyzer was calibrated carefully before making measurements, based on the manufacturer’s recommended procedure. Standard span gases and zero gas are used for the calibration of HC, CO, and NOx. In each test, volumetric fuel consumption, exhaust regulated gas emissions and exhaust gas temperatures are measured. From the first measurements, specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency are computed. The engine performance and exhaust emissions using the tested fuels and pure diesel fuel are investigated. Three runs of tests were performed under identical conditions to check for the repeatability of all results. Uncertainty analysis was performed to prove the accuracy of the experiments using the method described by Holman [42]. The details of the estimated average uncertainties of some measured at a typical operating condition are given in Table 5 ."
5,Results and discussion,"The main scope in the first section of the present work was to clarify the effect of increasing the percentage volume of butanol in the diesel-jojoba-butanol fuel blends on engine performance, exhaust gas temperatures and exhaust emissions. Blend ratios of butanol were varied in steps 5% by volume, thus 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% were the percentages of the butanol in the blend comprising of 5% Jojoba and 95% diesel fuel (DJ5). The best blend substitution of the diesel fuel with maintaining high thermal efficiency comparable to a conventional engine over a wide range of load conditions and a constant speed of 1500 rpm was determined. The second section introduced improving the engine performance and emissions of the selected fuel from the first section by using an emulsion of the selected fuel at high and low loads with a constant speed of 1500 rpm."
6,Engine performance and exhaust emissions of the diesel-J5-butanol blends,"4.1 Engine performance and exhaust emissions of the diesel-J5-butanol blends Figs. 3 and 4 show variations of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency (ηth) with increasing the percentage volume of butanol in the diesel-J5-butanol blends over a wide range of load conditions. As can be appreciated in both graphs, brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency are inversely proportional. It can be observed from Fig. 3 that the BSFC decreases with an increase in the brake power. It can also be noticed that at any brake power output, brake specific fuel consumption is higher for DJ5B15, DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 hence brake thermal efficiency is lower compared to diesel fuel or DJ5 blend. The reason may be that, the addition of butanol to DJ5 blend tends to increase the fuel consumption rate as a result of their low calorific values to obtain the same power output [19] as the DJ5B15, DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 have heating values that are about 6.2% to 8.9% less than diesel fuel, shown in Table 2. For instance, the BSFC for the DJ5B10, DJ5B15, DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 is found to be higher than that of diesel fuel by about 5.35%, 8.03%, 11.92% and 15.57% respectively at 25% load and about 1.25%, 3.29%, 6.21% and 9.43% at full load. At 75% load, the brake thermal efficiency of diesel fuel, DJ5, DJ5B5, DJ5B10, DJ5B15, DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 is 29.4%, 30.4%, 31.3%, 30.05%, 29.56%, 27.19% and 27.63% respectively. From Fig. 3, it is also evident that slight decrease of BSFC for the blends of DJ5B5 blend in most cases. The DJ5B5 blend produces BSFC of 269 g/kW.h at 75% load while is 273 g/kW.h at full load as the highest saving of BSFC reaches near 1.4% compared to diesel fuel. At low loads, there is no significant difference among the operation between the BSFC of DJ5B5 blend and diesel fuel. According to the results, the minimum BSFC is for DJ5 blend over a wide range of load conditions. It may be due to that the calorific value of DJ5 blend is close to diesel fuel which is more than all the blends and also the DJ5 blend has a beneficial effect on combustion as an oxygenated fuel especially in fuel rich zones [43] and thus BSFC decreases and hence brake thermal efficiency increases as shown in Fig. 5 . For the DJ5 blend, starting at 16.26% with 10% load, then brake thermal efficiency climbed up to around 25.1% at medium (50% load) and 30.2% at full load. The effect of butanol addition on peak pressure and delay period in diesel-J5-butanol blends are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . It can be seen that the peak pressure increases with increase in brake power as the amount of fuel burnt increases with increase in output power to meet the load. Moreover, a slight increase in the peak pressure was observed with an increase the percentage volume of butanol in the blends. This can be attributed to the longer ignition delay as shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen in the Figure, there exist significant differences in the ignition delay with increasing the percentage volume of butanol in the diesel-J5-butanol blends. In all cases of diesel-J5-butanol blends, a gradual increase in the ignition delay occurs as the fraction of butanol increases. It may be due to the change of physical properties such as density, viscosity, lower heating value and cetane number of the different fuels. Maximum cylinder pressure values are 77.3, 79.1, 80.8, 81.6 and 83 bar for DJ5B5, DJ5B10, DJ5B15, DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 respectively. The peak cylindrical pressure increases by 4.5% at DJ5B5 blend to diesel fuel and it increases by 6.9%, 9.2%, 10.3% and 12.2% for DJ5B10, DJ5B15, DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 respectively. The peak in-cylinder pressure corresponding to DJ5 blend is higher than diesel fuel by 2.7%. The variations of NOx emissions with loads for diesel-J5 and its blends with butanol as well as diesel fuel are illustrated in Fig. 7 . The results show that NOx emissions increase with increase in power for all the test fuels and that due to increase in the amount of fuel burned with load. Increasing the amount of fuel injected leads to higher cylinder temperatures which result in higher NOx concentration [44]. The NOx emissions with the DJ5 blend are higher than that with diesel fuel for the entire operating conditions. The NOx emission of diesel fuel at full load is 914 ppm whereas for the DJ5 is 1034 ppm with about 13.1% increases in the amount of NOx emission. It may be due to the higher temperatures of the combustion chamber with the DJ5 blend as the presence of fuel oxygen in the blend causes higher peak combustion pressure and temperature, causing an increase of NOx emissions from the engine. According to the Zeldovich mechanism, formation of NOx is prominent at high temperature, but also depends on oxygen content [45]. At any load, there is a gradual increase in the NOx emissions with increase in percentage of butanol in the DJ5 blend. As the fuel oxygen content directly influences NOx emissions as the higher the fuel oxygen content, the higher the NOx emissions. It may be due to the poor cetane number of butanol increase ignition delay of the blend [4] as shown in Fig. 6 resulting in an increase in NOx emissions. The ignition delay times are greatest for the DJ5B25, followed by DJ5B20, DJ5B15, DJ5B10, DJ5B5 and then diesel fuel with the least ignition delay time. This is equivalent to a reduction of the cetane number from CN = 52 to CN = 44 as shown in Table 2. Hence, the amount of NOx released by DJ5B25 blend is the maximum value of 64.9% higher compared to diesel fuel at full load. For instance, NOx emissions are 708, 899, 1009, 1070, 1063 and 1132 ppm for the DJ5, DJ5B5, DJ5B10, DJ5B15, DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 at 75% load respectively. The exhaust gas temperatures for the diesel-J5-butanol blends were found to be higher than that of diesel fuel in the entire engine operation as shown in Fig. 8 . The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of the diesel fuel was 401 °C while for the DJ5, DJ5B5, DJ5B10, DJ5B15, DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 were 427, 435, 440, 471, 493 and 507 °C at 75% load. The maximum exhaust gas temperature of about 543 °C was obtained at full load when the engine operated with DJ5B25. The variation of CO emissions with increasing the amount of butanol in the DJ5 blend at different loading conditions is shown in Fig. 9 . The blends have more oxygen content than the diesel fuel as the existence of oxygen content in fuel molecule favours a more complete combustion as a consequence of a lower level of CO emissions. So, Fig. 9 clearly shows that CO emissions of diesel-J5-butanol blends are lower than the diesel fuel at the different loads. Also, the results indicate that CO emissions tend to decrease as the percentage of butanol in the DJ5 blend increases. The reduction is to be smaller with the DJ5B5 and DJ5B10 and the decrease is generally significant in blends of DJ5B20 and DJ5B25. These results are in agreement with several studies [28,30] have established that presence of chemically bound oxygen in methyl esters increases the oxidation of combustion intermediate products thereby enhancing the oxidation rate of CO. For instance, using DJ5B5 and DJ5B10, CO emissions decrease by 12% and 16.6% respectively as compared to diesel fuel at 75% load. However, CO emissions decrease by an average of 43.7% and 45.4% when using DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 respectively. DJ5 blend gives higher CO emissions than that of the other designed fuels at high engine loads. This may be due to the fact that the high viscosity can make atomization of the fuel more difficult resulting in a worse mixing and evaporation process in the combustion chamber [46]. Also it has been shown by [47] that CO emissions increased when the coconut oil amount increased in the diesel fuel blends, due to the poor spray characteristics of coconut oil, poor mixing, and consequently poor combustion because of coconut oil has a viscosity of about 8 times as much as that of diesel fuel. The DJ5 blend produces a 48.6% higher viscosity than pure diesel fuel and that causes poor mixing and consequently poor combustion leading to higher CO emissions higher. One of the causes of increased emissions of hydrocarbons in exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine can be incomplete combustion process. Hydrocarbons are generated due to incomplete or partial combustion of fuel, which is transported in the form of vapour with the exhaust gas. With oxygen deficiency and low temperature, part of fuel is not oxidised during the combustion process [2,5]. Fig. 10 presents hydrocarbon emissions from diesel fuel and diesel-J5-butanol blends at different load conditions. It is observed that with increase the butanol in blend content, the HC emissions decrease comparatively to neat diesel fuel. HC emissions for Diesel-J5-butanol blends vary from 17 to 68 ppm. Using DJ5B5, HC emissions decreased by 7.7% compared to diesel fuel, while using DJ5B25 blend result in a 42.3% decrease at 75% load. The reason for low HC emissions with the increase butanol in the blend may be due to more oxygen content than diesel fuel which improves the combustion quality in the combustion chamber. In general, the maximum HC emissions of about 78 ppm obtain at full load when the engine operates with diesel fuel alone."
7,Selection of best diesel-J5-butanol blend,"4.2 Selection of best diesel-J5-butanol blend According to the above analysis, it can be concluded that a decrease in CO and HC emissions in the almost of the operating conditions but an increase in the NOx emissions at all brake powers for the diesel-J5-butanol blends than diesel fuel or DJ5 blend. From the emission point of view, the DJ5B5 blend was found to produce higher CO and HC and lower NOx emissions as compared with DJ5B10 blend. However, both fuel blends tested exhibited lower CO and HC and higher NOx emissions as compared with diesel fuel. So, the experimental data of the variation of CO, HC, NOx and BSFC versus percentage of butanol in the DJ5 blend is normalized to obtain the suitable blend as shown in Fig. 11 . It can be seen that 5–10% butanol in the DJ5 blend is a good based on the minimum BSFC, exhaust emissions and maximum brake thermal efficiency which represents the gray area in the Figure. Considering both performance and emissions, any blend within the ratio of 5–10% butanol in the DJ5 blend is a suitable blend that gives simultaneously better performance and keeps CO, HC and NOx emissions low. Therefore DJ5B8 blend is selected in this study. So the aim in the following section is to investigate the impacts of adding hydrogen peroxide or water with DJ5B8 blend on the performance parameters and emissions. The study is carried out using 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of hydrogen peroxide or water by volume in the DJ5B8 blend. As an example the 90% DJ5B8 blend with 10% H2O2 or 10% water is named 90%DJ5B8-10%H and 90%DJ5B8-10%W respectively. The main properties of the selected blends used are summarized in Table 3. The tests were performed at two different engine loads. The engine evaluation at 1500 rpm-25% load represent a low load condition for highway operation and 1500 rpm- full load represent heavy load operation. 4.2.1 Effect of hydrogen peroxide or water content in DJ5B8 blend on the performance Figs. 12 and 13 depict the variation of BSFC, exhaust gas temperatures and exhaust emissions with different loads for different blends of hydrogen peroxide or water with DJ5B8 blend. From the investigation, it can be noticed that adding both of hydrogen peroxide or water to DJ5B8 blend increases the fuel consumption in the most cases. The emulsified fuel ratios with hydrogen peroxide give the best results than the emulsified fuel ratios with water. The improvements relative to water are greater with the higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide because of its decomposition at a rapid rate releasing steam, oxygen and heat. Molecular structure of hydrogen peroxide is similar to water so that emulsified fuel containing hydrogen peroxide has the effect of water emulsified fuel and in addition active oxygen was generated, which helps combustion to approach complete combustion [48]. For instance, BSFC for the 90%DJ5B8-10%H, 85%DJ5B8-15%H is found to be higher by about 2.71%, and 7.75%, respectively, than that of DJ5B8 blend at full load while for 90%DJ5B8-10%W and 85%DJ5B8-15%W are 6.27% and 12.26%. It may be due to its lower calorific value which increases fuel consumption for same desired power output [19]. The highest BSFC (523 g/kW.h) being for 80%DJ5B8-20%W at low load (25% load) as the combustion process is more easily quenched due to the low cylinder pressure, equivalence ratio and low mean cylinder temperature. Also according to experimental results, it is observed that 95%DJ5B8-5%H has given the best performance result than the other emulsified fuel ratios and diesel fuel. Adding 5% hydrogen peroxide to DJ5B8 blend decreases the BSFC relatively by 0.97% as compared to DJ5B8 blend at full load. The BSFC of pure diesel fuel and DJ5B8 blend were 276.9 g/kW.h and 277.3 g/kW.h while for emulsified 95%DJ5B8-5%H was 274.6 g/kW.h. The ηth of emulsified DJ5B8 with 5% H2O2 was 2.72% higher than that of DJ5B8 blend at full load and when compared to pure diesel fuel an improvement of 7.79% in the ηth is observed. This improvement of the combustion behavior is attributed to the secondary atomization induced by the micro-explosions of the emulsified fuel [49]. Since water and fuel have different boiling temperatures, the evaporation rates of these two liquids will be different. As a result, the water molecules reach their superheated stage faster than the fuel, creating vapor expansions breakup [50]. 4.2.2 Effect of hydrogen peroxide or water content in DJ5B8 blend on the emissions In all cases, the hydrogen peroxide or water content in the emulsified fuel decrease both the NOx emissions and exhaust gas temperatures as shown in Figs. 12 and 13. The addition of hydrogen peroxide or water results in a decrease in temperature inside the combustion chamber due to evaporation, dissociation of water during combustion and an increase in local specific heat capacity [51]. The combination of hydrogen peroxide with DJ5B8 blend would be expected to show excellent improvements over water across all emissions. The reduction of NOx emissions with adding 5%, 10% and 15% of H2O2 to DJ5B8 blend at full load is 13.5%, 24.4%, and 31.7%, respectively. On the other hand, the NOx emissions reduced by 12.7%, 21.3% and 33.2% for the 95%DJ5B8-5%W, 90%DJ5B8-10%W and 85%DJ5B8-15%W compared to DJ5B8 blend respectively. Kim et al. [52] discovered that hydrogen peroxide assisted the conversion of harmful nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide in diesel exhaust gas. As shown in Fig. 12a, the exhaust gas temperatures were dropped by about 38–114 °C during the operation with emulsified DJ5B8 blend using 5–20% hydrogen peroxide content. This reduction may be due to the latent heat of evaporation of water and the high thermal capacity of water which can reduce the temperature in the combustion chamber as indicated by lower exhaust gas temperatures and consequently reduce NOx emissions. The results are also in agreement with similar experiments done by [48,53]. The maximum exhaust gas temperature of 449 °C is observed at full load when the engine is running on DJ5B8 blend. For emulsified 95%DJ5B8-5%H the exhaust gas temperature reduced by 5.1% while for emulsified 95%DJ5B8-5%W the exhaust gas temperature reduced by 3.2% compared to pure diesel fuel at full load. The variations of CO and HC emissions with increasing the hydrogen peroxide or water content in the DJ5B8 blend as a function of the engine loads are presented in Figs. 12 and 13. It can be noticed that the trend of CO emissions is similar to HC emissions change under the different working conditions for either hydrogen peroxide or water content in the DJ5B8 blend. It is clear that in all operating conditions, CO and HC emissions increase with increasing hydrogen peroxide level in the blend except at 5% hydrogen peroxide content. The increase in the CO, HC emissions is an index to indicate the defective combustion and it is proved that the operation using the emulsified 80%DJ5B8-20%H is not suitable under the different working conditions. The lowest CO emission of 978 ppm was obtained for 95%DJ5B8-5%H, which was 6.3% lower than diesel fuel, 11% less than DJ5 blend at full load. The improvement of the combustion behavior may be due to the secondary atomization induced by the micro-explosions of the emulsified fuel [49,50]. Trade off higher CO, HC emissions and NOx emissions were with 10–20% hydrogen peroxide and that primarily due to the effect of fuel quenching in the emulsified DJ5B8 blend causing incomplete combustion. The values of CO emissions are lower for DJ5B8 blend with hydrogen peroxide compared to DJ5B8 blend with water. It may be due to excessive oxygen of hydrogen peroxide which reduces the emission of carbon monoxide in the form of carbon dioxide. At full load, CO emissions for DJ5B8, 95%DJ5B8-5%H, 90%DJ5B8-10%H, 85%DJ5B8-15%H and 80%DJ5B8-20%H are1020, 978 ppm, 1009 ppm, 1121 ppm and 1232 ppm, whereas it is 1020, 1011 ppm, 994 ppm, 1126 ppm and 1247 ppm for DJ5B8, 95%DJ5B8-5%W, 90%DJ5B8-10%W, 85%DJ5B8-15%W and 80%DJ5B8-20%W respectively. From the investigation, it is observed that significant change in HC emissions were observed for DJ5B8 blend with hydrogen peroxide compared to DJ5B8 blend with water. The highest contents of HC emissions in engine exhaust were found for of DJ5B8 blend with 20% of hydrogen peroxide. In light of the above, the DJ5B8 blend with different blends of hydrogen peroxide resulted in an improvement over water with respect to NOx emissions and CO emissions. Also, increase in percentage of each hydrogen peroxide to 10% with DJ5B8 blend led to mean reduction in NOx, CO and HC emissions by 18.9%, 3.6%, 4% respectively. However, it did not lead to significant changes in BSFC and mean increase of brake thermal efficiency by 2.3%. After exceeding 10% of hydrogen peroxide in the blend, mean increase of BSFC by almost 13%, mean increase of CO and HC emissions by 15.3% and 32.8% and while decline of NOx emissions by 39% were observed. Finally, it can be concluded that the use of the DJ5B8 blend with 5% of hydrogen peroxide is a good solution for reducing engine emissions and improving its performance."
8,Conclusions,"This an experimental investigation examined the effect of increasing the amount of butanol in the diesel-jojoba fuel blend on the diesel engine performance, exhaust gas temperatures and exhaust emissions in a direct injection diesel engine. Also, the effects of hydrogen peroxide or water content in the emulsified DJ5B8 blend on emissions and engine performance were studied. Tests were made over a wide range of load conditions and a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The main results obtained in this study are as follows: 1. Addition of butanol to DJ5 blend increased the fuel consumption rate as a result of their low calorific. At the part load, higher BSFC was noticed in comparison to higher loads. BSFC for the DJ5B10, DJ5B15, DJ5B20 and DJ5B25 was found to be higher than that of diesel fuel by about 5.35%, 8.03%, 11.92% and 15.57% at 25% load respectively and about 1.25%, 3.29%, 6.21% and 9.43% at full load. 2. The DJ5B5 blend produced BSFC of 273 g/kW.h at full load as the highest saving of BSFC reached near 1.4% compared to diesel fuel. 3. A slight increase in the peak pressure was observed with an increase the percentage volume of butanol in the blends. 4. In all cases of diesel-J5-butanol blends, a gradual increase in the ignition delay occurred as the fraction of butanol increased. The ignition delay times were greatest for the DJ5B25, followed by DJ5B20, DJ5B15, DJ5B10, DJ5B5 and then diesel fuel with the least ignition delay time. 5. CO and HC emissions of diesel-J5-butanol blends were lower than the diesel fuel at the different loads while NOx emissions were higher. As the highest contents of NOx, in engine exhaust were found for DJ5B25 blend. 6. The best ratio of butanol in the diesel-jojoba fuel blends substitution of the diesel fuel was 8% at overall load conditions for better performance and emissions. 7. The emulsified fuel ratios with hydrogen peroxide had the better results than the emulsified fuel ratios with water. 8. At full load BSFC for the 90%DJ5B8-10%H, 85%DJ5B8-15%H was found to be higher by about 2.71%, and 7.75%, respectively, than that of DJ5B8 blend while for 90%DJ5B8-10%W and 85%DJ5B8-15%W was 6.27% and 12.26%. 9. In all cases, addition of hydrogen peroxide or water to DJ5B8 blend had a positive effect on the level of NOx emissions and exhaust gas temperatures. The reduction of NOx emissions with adding 5%, 10% and 15% of H2O2 to DJ5B8 blend at full load was 13.5%, 24.4%, and 31.7% respectively compared to DJ5B8 blend. 10. At all operating conditions, CO and HC emissions increased with increasing hydrogen peroxide level in the blend except at 5% hydrogen peroxide content. 11. Trade off higher CO, HC emissions and NOx emissions were with 10–20% hydrogen peroxide in DJ5B8 blend 12. The use of the DJ5B8 blend with 5% of hydrogen peroxide (95%DJ5B8-5%H) was a good solution for reducing engine emissions and improving its performance."
