0,Introduction,"Climate change is associated with the release of carbon dioxide from increasing use of fossil fuels. Furthermore, the fossil fuel storages are exhausting and thus renewably produced hydrogen may have potential in the future. Hydrogen gas has many advantages; it has most energy per unit mass (122 MJ/kg), and it can be used for electricity production in fuel cells with water and heat as the only end-products [1,2]. Dark fermentative hydrogen productions from both pure cellulosic materials, such as cellulose and xylan [3,4], and renewable cellulosic materials, such as food waste, sugarcane bagasse and paper mill waste [4–6], have been studied extensively. Grass silage is a potential cellulosic material for biological hydrogen production. Silage is produced by fermentation of grass with lactic acid as the main degradation product. In addition to recalcitrant lignin, other main component of silage, i.e. cellulose and hemicellulose, can be biologically hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars [7,8]. Silage has been used earlier as carbon and electron source for sulfate reducing bacteria in treatment of wastewaters containing metals [9]. Furthermore, silage has been used for methane production without pretreatment [10]. Pakarinen et al. [11] used silage for dark fermentative hydrogen production with a dairy farm digester or digested sewage sludge as seed material. They reported a hydrogen yield of 16.0 mL H2/g VS at 70 °C and pH 6 with farm digester inoculum. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of using indigenous bacteria directly for hydrogen fermentation of silage. In dark fermentation, cellulose and hemicellulose are first fermented into sugars that are further converted through puryvate into acids, alcohols, H2 and CO2. Fermentation of puryvate generates excess electrons that are directed to hydrogen production (for a review, see [12]). In nature, hydrogen is utilized by, e.g. methanogens. Methanogens can be inhibited, for example by heat-treatment [3] or chemicals [6] to increase hydrogen yields. Increasing substrate concentration has been reported to increase the hydrogen production rates [13,14] but to decrease hydrogen yields [15]. Furthermore, high substrate concentration may inhibit cellulose degradation and hydrogen production [13,16]. The objective of this work was to study the potential of using grass silage both as a source of bacteria and as a substrate for dark fermentative hydrogen production. Hydrogen production was studied at 25–200 g silage/L, at 37 °C and pH 7.0. Hydrogen production was also studied with 25 g silage/L by inhibiting methanogens with 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA). The microbial communities enriched during silage fermentation to hydrogen were characterized with polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Hydrogen production from silage,"2.1 Hydrogen production from silage Silage was used as a source of microbes as well as a substrate in batch assays in 500 mL flasks with a working volume of 150 mL. Silage was obtained from MTT Agrifood Research, Jokioinen, Finland, and the composition of silage was as described in Table 1 . In the first enrichment phase, silage concentrations of 25, 50, 100 and 200 g/L were tested in triplicate. Water (150 mL) was added to the serum bottles followed by incubation at 37 °C and pH 7.0 with a mechanical mixing of 150 rpm. The second enrichment was done with a working volume of 250 mL, with silage concentration of 25 g/L and 4% (v/v) inoculum obtained from the 1st enrichment phase with 25 g/L silage. Methanogens were inhibited with 20 mM BESA and 250 mL medium was added to the flasks. One liter of medium contained 10.7 g NaH2PO4, 3.2 g Na2HPO4, 0.6 g NH4Cl, 0.125 g KH2PO4, 0.11 g CaCl2·2H2O, 0.1 g MgCl2·6H2O, 4 g NaHCO3, 2.18 g FeCl2·4H2O, 50 μg H3BO3, 50 μg ZnCl2, 38 μg CuCl2·2H2O, 41 μg MnCl2·2H2O, 50 μg (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 50 μg AlCl3, 50 μg CoCl2·6H2O, 50 μg NiCl2·6H2O, 0.5 g EDTA, 2 g yeast extract, 0.013 g Na2S2O4 and vitamin solution (DSMZ medium No141, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures). The biogas and liquid samples were collected two or three times a week and the pH was adjusted (7.0 ± 0.1) at the same time."
3,Analysis,"2.2 Analysis Headspace hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide, were determined with a Shimadzu gas chromatograph GC-2014 equipped with Porapak N column (80/100 mesh) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The temperatures of oven, injector and detector were 80, 110 and 110 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. Liquid samples were filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and the soluble metabolites were analyzed with a Shimadzu High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a Rezex RHM-Monosaccharide column (Phenomenex) and a refraction index detector (Shimadzu). Mobile phase was 5 mM H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and the column temperature was kept at 40 °C. The sugar concentration in the samples was determined with phenol-sulfuric acid method modified from Dubois et al. [17]. The composition and characteristics of silage were analyzed by MTT Agrifood Research, Finland. Bacterial communities were analyzed with DNA extraction and PCR-DGGE of partial 16S rRNA genes followed by their sequencing. Duplicate samples were taken aseptically from the end points of hydrogen production experiments, samples were centrifuged (7500 g, 10 min) and the biomass was stored at −20 °C. DNA was extracted with a PowerSoil™ DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc.). PCR-DGGE analysis, the re-amplification of the bands as well as analysis of the sequence data were done as described by Nissilä et al. [3]."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Hydrogen production from silage,"3.1 Hydrogen production from silage Grass silage fermentation is controlled by pH decrease (to below 4.0) due to lactic acid formation. In this study, the fermentation was continued by increasing the pH of the silage to 7.0. Neutral pH has been reported favorable both for cellulolytic and hydrogenic bacteria [18,19]. In the first enrichment phase, the silage concentrations from 25 to 200 g/L (wet weight) were used corresponding to 5.8–46.5 g dry matter/L. Silage has low pH and contains high amounts of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and lactic acid (Table 1). The cumulative hydrogen production and changes in pH were as shown in Fig. 1 . Total soluble sugars in the batch assays were analyzed regularly and their concentrations remained between 44 and 810 mg/L (results not shown). This suggests that the sugars were produced and simultaneously fermented to hydrogen and soluble metabolites. Cumulative H2 production and H2 yield per g silage (wet weight) and per g dry matter (dry matter content of silage was 23.3%) were determined. The cumulative hydrogen production and hydrogen yield varied from 142 ± 22 to 266 ± 35 mL H2 and from 37.8 ± 5.8 to 8.9 ± 1.2 mL H2/g silage, respectively, at 25–200 g silage/L. The highest hydrogen yield of 163 ± 25 mL H2/g dry matter was obtained at 25 g silage/L. The hydrogen yield decreased with an increase in silage concentration, which probably resulted from the high ratio of solids to liquid [20]. Methane was produced after 15 days. The highest and lowest production yields were 26.2 ± 3.3 and 5.4 ± 1.1 mL CH4/g silage and were obtained at silage concentrations of 50 and 200 g/L, respectively. The highest hydrogen yield was higher than that obtained from fodder maize and wilted perennial ryegrass, 62.4 ± 6.1 and 75.6 ± 8.8 mL H2/g dry matter, respectively [21]. The compositions of soluble metabolites produced during hydrogen fermentation are indicators of the efficiency of the bioprocess [22,23]. The concentration of soluble metabolites increased with time and more VFAs were produced at higher silage concentrations (Fig. 2 ). Acetic acid and butyric acid contributed to 60–69% and 25–33% of soluble metabolites, respectively, whereas ethanol concentrations remained low (1.2–2.9% of soluble metabolites). The high acetate and butyrate and low ethanol production indicated efficient biohydrogen production, since acetate and butyrate productions are associated with H2 production, whereas generation of solvents consumes free electrons derived from NADH and leads to unfavorable conditions for H2 production [24–26]. During the first enrichment phase, pH was adjusted to 7.0 every second or third day. However, the pH decreased from 7.0 to 5.3–6.6 between feedings (Fig. 1) due to acid production and absence of buffer capacity. The decrease in pH stabilized toward the end due to deceased VFA production. One of the most important factors to be regulated in fermentation processes is pH [27,28]. The pH affects hydrogen yield, soluble metabolite distribution and also influences the structure of the microbial communities [26,29–31]. It has been reported that pH below 6.0 inhibits cellulolytic bacteria [32]. However, increasing the pH in this study sustained cellulose degradation and hydrogen production potentials. In the second enrichment step methanogens were inhibited, buffered medium and a silage concentration of 25 g/L were used. The cumulative biohydrogen production and changes in pH were as shown in Fig. 3 A. No methane was produced. The hydrogen yield was 32.3 ± 3.7 mL H2/g silage corresponding to 139 ± 16 mL H2/g dry matter, and the pH did not decrease below 6.8. The concentration of total soluble sugars remained between 130 and 490 mg/L. The main soluble metabolite was acetate (65%) followed by propionate (17%), butyrate (12%) and ethanol (6%) (Fig. 3B). Acetate as the only by-product results in higher H2 yields than butyrate; theoretically 4 mol H2/mol glucose (Eqs. (1)) and 2 mol H2/mol glucose (Eq. (2)), respectively. The acetate concentration was higher in the second than first enrichment phase, whilst the hydrogen yield remained 15% lower in the second enrichment. One reason for this may be 0.6 g/L propionate in the second enrichment phase. Propionate production requires electrons (Eq. (3)) and thus, decreases hydrogen yield. According to Eqs. (1) and (2) decreasing butyrate/acetate ratio increases the hydrogen yields as reported by de Amorim et al. [33] and Kim et al. [34]. In this study, the butyrate/acetate ratios in the first and second enrichments were 0.31 and 0.20, respectively, implicating that higher H2 yields were obtained with higher butyrate/acetate ratio. Hafez et al. [35] also reported higher hydrogen yields with lower acetate/butyrate ratios. Regardless of the favorable distribution of metabolites and only slight decrease in pH, the hydrogen yield in the second enrichment remained lower than in the first enrichment phase. (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O"
6,Microbial community analysis,"3.2 Microbial community analysis Bacterial communities at the end points of silage (25 g/L) fermentation were analyzed in the first enrichment phase and presented in Table 2 and Fig. 4 . The original silage contained notable amounts of only one bacterium that was closely related to Lactobacillus homohiochii (99.4–100% similarity). L. homohiochii produces mainly lactic acid from hexoses, such as glucose, fructose and mannose. It grows optimally at pH 5.0 and does not grow at pH above 6.0 [36] and therefore, it was not detected in the enrichment cultures where pH was maintained at 7.0. The bacteria in the enrichment cultures belonged mainly to phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. In the first enrichment phase with 25 g/L silage, bacteria included Ruminobacillus xylanolyticum, Gracilibacter thermotolerans, Acetanaerobacterium elongatum and Clostridium populeti. R. xylanolyticum is a rumen bacterium and degrades xylan. It has been earlier reported in a thermophilic anaerobic reactor co-treating organic fraction of municipal solid wastes and fat, oil and grease wastes [37]. G. thermotolerans grows between 25 and 54 °C and at pH 6.0–8.3. On glucose it produces acetate, lactate and ethanol [38]. A. elongatum is isolated from wastewater sludge, grows at 20–42 °C and pH 5.0–7.5, and ferments several mono-, di- and oligosaccharides with the production of acetate, ethanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide [39]. C. populeti is a mesophilic, cellulolytic bacterium that grows on, e.g. arabinose, xylose, glucose, cellobiose, sucrose and cellulose. C. populeti grows optimally at 35 °C and pH 7.0 and produces acetate, butyrate, lactate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide [40]. In addition to above bacteria, bacteria related to an aerobic bacterium Comamonas kerstersii, Comamonas testosteroni isolated from sediment, and two uncultured Clostridia were detected in the first enrichment culture. R. xylanolyticum, A. elongatum and C. populeti were likely associated with silage fermentation to hydrogen. In addition, Clostridial species are usually related to hydrogen production (for a review, see [18])."
7,Conclusions,"The following conclusions of using grass silage for hydrogen fermentation can be drawn: 1. Increasing the silage pH to 7.0 results in hydrogen fermentation by indigenous silage bacteria. The highest H2 yield of 160 mL H2/g dry matter was obtained at 25 g/L silage with acetate and butyrate a the main metabolites. 2. Increasing silage concentration resulted in increasing cumulative H2 production and decreasing H2 yields. 3. Enrichment in the presence of BESA resulted in lower H2 yields due to increased propionate production and decreased butyrate/acetate ratio. 4. Silage fermentation to hydrogen was associated with bacteria related to R. xylanolyticum, A. elongatum and C. populeti."
