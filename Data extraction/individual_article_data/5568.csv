0,Introduction,"In multi-step organic syntheses, the development of highly selective chemical reaction pathways is essential to lead to cost-effective processes. One of the main challenges in organic synthesis is to minimize side reactions that form undesired by-products. For example, both amines and anilines act as strong nucleophiles that readily share the electron lone pair on nitrogen with electrophilic reagents such as strong Brønsted acids and halogens, which can result in side reactions to undesired products [1]. For this reason, the protection of functional groups such as amines, alcohols, and acids is frequently necessary to avoid undesired side reactions [2–4]. Amine functionalities can be preserved by various protecting groups such as carbobenzyloxy, tert-butyloxycarbonyl, acetyl, benzoyl and benzyl groups, which ultimately need to be removed in subsequent deprotection steps [4]. In the case of benzyl protecting groups, debenzylation by catalytic hydrogenation has been widely used in the fine chemical industries [5]. Although hydrogenation is one of the effective methods for debenyzlation, it can also lead to undesired side reactions, particularly when an aromatic halogen is present to form by-products via dehalogenation [6–10]. In this context, selectivity control is important to maximize product yield while maintaining valuable C–F and C–X bonds [11] and minimizing the formation of undesired, and often difficult to remove, by-products. Selective debenzylation by hydrogenation has been studied in prior works. Owing to its higher activity and selectivity, palladium supported on activated carbon is the most commonly used catalyst for debenzylation applications [2,7,9]. Studer and Blaser used 4-chloro-N,N-dibenzylaniline to examine the factors determining selectivity to debenzylation products [9]. They demonstrated that debenzylation is favored in the presence of acids, while dehalogenation is favored in the presence of bases. In addition, polar solvents appeared to favor debenzylation. David and Vannice also studied the kinetics of hydrogenation of 4-chloro-N,N-dibenzylaniline on Pd-based catalysts in a buffered solvent [7]. They reported that the selectivity for debenzylation was equal to that for dechlorination at the pH value corresponding to the pKa of the substrate. Although selective debenzylation of chloro-containing aromatic has been studied in prior work, however, the fundamental differences between fluoro- and chloro-containing aniline were not addressed in these studies. The difference in the reactivity between the two substituted species is well known [12]. In addition, fluorine is one of the important elements in pharmaceutical drug development [11] owing to the need for controlling the purity of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) [13]. Indeed, in 1970 there were only about 2% of fluorine-containing drugs on the market, while the number has increased currently to about 25% [11]. Cleavage of the C–F bond can give rise to the H-containing analog which can be difficult to separate by traditional means due to their structural similarity. Therefore, preventing the formation of H-containing analogs is ideal in these types of reactions. In this context, it is important to understand hydrogenation process with fluorine substituted compounds. In the present study, the kinetic details of hydrogenation of N-benzyl-4-fluoroaniline, NB4FA, a compound that can undergo both debenzylation and defluorination, were investigated in a semi-batch reactor. The reaction network involving hydrogenation of NB4FA is illustrated in Fig. 1 . For Pd-based catalysts on different supports (e.g., C, SiO2, Al2O3), the effects of various operating parameters (e.g., temperature, H2 pressure, solvent, buffer) were examined to identify factors that influence the selectivity between debenzylation and defluorination pathways. It was found that Pd/C catalyst with methanol solvent exhibited the highest activity and selectivity to the desired product 4-fluoroaniline, 4FA. In this case, aniline was the main by-product of NB4FA hydrogenation and only trace levels of undesired product N-benzylaniline, NBA, were observed. For this reason, the kinetics of both NB4FA debenzylation (Reaction I in Fig. 1) and 4-fluoroaniline defluorination to aniline (Reaction III in Fig. 1) were investigated in further detail to understand the reaction pathways of NB4FA hydrogenation in methanol. We also describe the kinetic data using a mechanism for Reaction I following Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic models. Finally, the kinetics for Reactions I and III were combined to predict the complete transient reaction profiles of NB4FA hydrogenation."
1,Materials and experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The catalysts used in this study were commercial 5wt% Pd in reduced form on three different powder supports: activated carbon (Alfa Aesar), Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar), SiO2 (Stream Chemicals). Methanol (99.8%, Mallinckrodt), tetrahydrofuran (THF; 99.9%, Fisher Scientific), toluene (99.9%, Mallinckrodt), and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2Me-THF; >99%, Sigma Aldrich) were used as solvents and triethylamine (TEA; 99.9%) and acetic acid (AcOH; >99.7%, Macron) were used as buffers to adjust the acidity/basicity of the solution. N-benzyl-4-fluoroaniline (NB4FA, Eli Lilly and Company), 4-Fluoroaniline (4FA; >97%, Sigma Aldrich), N-benzylaniline (NBA; >99%, Alfa Aesar) and aniline (A; >99%, Fisher Scientific) were used either as reactants or to calibrate the gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N). The NB4FA (>92%) is commercially available (CAS 370-77-4), however, it was prepared for these studies using standard conditions [14]. The synthesized NB4FA was confirmed to be the correct compound according to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS): 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400MHz) δ (ppm): 7.38–7.24 (m, 5H), 6.91–6.84 (m, 2H), 6.58–6.52 (m, 2H), 4.27 (s, 2H), 4.00 (brs, 1H); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100MHz) δ (ppm): 157.1, 154.7, 144.5, 139.2, 128.7, 127.5, 127.3, 115.8, 155.6, 113.7, 113.6, 48.9 (observed complexity due to C–F splitting); 19F NMR (CDCl3, 376MHz) δ (ppm): −127.9; HRMS for C13H12FN [M·]: m/z calc.: 201.09538. Found: 201.09557, which matches well characterization data in the literature [15]."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements were carried out at 77K for the catalyst samples to determine the BET surface area using surface area and porosimetry analyzer (ASAP 2000, Micromeritics). The Pd dispersion of each sample was measured by the hydrogen–oxygen titration technique, using the pulse mode [16]. Particle sizes of powder catalysts were characterized by a light-scattering particle size distribution analyzer (Horiba-950). The results of catalyst characterization are summarized in Table 1 ."
4,Reaction measurements,"2.3 Reaction measurements A schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2 . First, 200mL of solution containing NB4FA, solvent, buffer and catalyst was loaded inside a Parr reactor under an inert argon environment. The standard operating conditions were: temperature: 40°C, H2 pressure: 5atm, buffer: 0.5vol% acetic acid, and agitation speed: 800rpm. For screening studies of catalysts, solvents, and buffer, 0.1g of Pd/C was used, while for detailed kinetic experiments, 0.015g of Pd/C was used. The reaction vessel was heated from room temperature to the target temperature with the PID controller. Upon reaching the desired temperature, the reactor was purged and pressurized with H2 at the target pressure. The reaction was started by initiating stirring and setting the agitation rate to 800rpm. A small sample of the solution was removed at specific times after the start of the reaction, and filtered through a syringe filter (0.2μm) prior to gas chromatography analysis. The gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a SLM-5MS capillary column (Sigma Aldrich, 15m×0.25mm). After cooling the reactor to room temperature at the end of the experiment, the pressurized gas inside the reactor vessel was passed through a sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution to neutralize HF, which can be produced by defluorination. To remove any residual catalyst and a liquid mixture from a previous run, the experimental setup including the vessel, tubing, valves and agitator was cleaned and flushed with deionized water, followed by isopropyl alcohol after each experiment. In addition, the reactor was periodically cleaned by heating with mixed ethanol/water (2/1 in volume) solution at 80°C in a batch mode, which was also conducted before a blank run test."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Mass transfer considerations,"3.1 Mass transfer considerations Multi-phase reaction systems such as catalytic hydrogenation involve internal and external mass transfer processes, which can influence the reaction kinetics [17]. Therefore, it is important to verify absence of mass transfer limitations prior to determining the kinetic parameters. In the present study, the absence of liquid–solid external mass transfer was confirmed experimentally by measuring initial reaction rates with varying agitation speed [18,19]. It was found that the initial reaction rates did not change above 600rpm (∼275W/m3) under the standard operating conditions. For this reason, all the experiments were conducted at 800rpm (∼640W/m3). In order to further ascertain the absence of interparticle and intraparticle mass transfer limitations, the criteria described by Ramachandran and Chaudhari [17] and by Weisz and Prater [20] were used, respectively. The particle size of Pd/C was determined to be 15.2μm. The liquid-to-catalyst mass transfer coefficients for H2 and NB4FA, kS , were estimated to be 7.61×10− 3 and 1.50×10− 3 m/s, respectively [21]. The effective diffusivities of H2 and NB4FA, Deff , were calculated to be 1.73×10− 9 and 4.79×10− 9 (m2/s) by Aspen software using Wilke–Chang correlation [22]. In order to obtain criteria parameter values, the NB4FA hydrogenation turnover frequency (TOF) values were obtained from the initial rates of NB4FA consumption divided by the total amount of surface Pd active sites determined by H2 chemisorption experiments, and the results are listed in Table 2 . According to the criteria, for absence of mass transfer limitations, the interparticle and intraparticle parameters should be less than 0.1 and 0.3, respectively. Table 3 shows the results by using the data obtained at 55°C. The results clearly satisfy the criteria, suggesting that the investigated reaction system was conducted in the absence of external and internal mass transfer limitations."
7,"Screening catalyst supports, solvents and buffer","3.2 Screening catalyst supports, solvents and buffer Screening tests were performed prior to the detailed kinetic studies of NB4FA hydrogenation. The Pd-based catalysts were selected since they have been reported to be most effective for debenzylation [2,7]. Along with Pd on different powder supports (activated carbon, SiO2, Al2O3), several solvents and acidic/basic buffers were investigated in the present study. Based on the activity and selectivity to desired product (4FA), the most promising support, solvent and buffer were selected and the detailed hydrogenation kinetics were investigated by varying the operating conditions. 3.2.1 Effect of solvent In organic synthesis, the solvent frequently plays an important role in determining not only reaction rate, but also reaction pathways leading to different product distributions. Studer and Blaser studied the effect of solvent on hydrogenation of 4-chloro-N,N-dibenzyl aniline and found that the overall reaction rate (debenzylation and dehalogenation) was faster in polar solvents than in non-polar solvents [9]. Similar results about the effect of solvent polarity on hydrogenation rates have been reported in other works [23]. In the present study, four solvents (methanol, THF, 2Me-THF, toluene) were tested under the standard operating conditions (40°C, 5atm H2, 800rpm) with a loading of 0.1g Pd/C and in the absence of buffer. Fig. 3 shows the effect of solvent on NB4FA conversion and selectivity to 4FA. As expected, higher hydrogenation activities were observed for polar solvents (methanol, THF, 2Me-THF) than for the non-polar solvent (toluene). The hydrogenation rate correlated well with dielectric constant value (ε at 25°C) of each solvent [9]. As shown in Fig.3a, among the four solvents, the highest hydrogenation rate was observed with methanol (ε =32.7), followed by THF (ε =7.58), 2Me-THF (ε =6.97), and toluene (ε =2.38) [24]. Fig.3b shows selectivity profiles with reaction time for the different solvents. Aniline was observed to be the main by-product in all cases and trace levels of n-benzylaniline (0.1–0.3mol% of products) were observed for 2Me-THF and toluene. For the polar solvents, reactions involve relatively fast debenzylation to 4FA, followed by defluorination to aniline, while defluorination of NB4FA to NBA was observed even at low conversion (<10%) for toluene, indicating that reaction pathways are influenced by solvent type. 3.2.2 Effect of catalyst support Based on the results from Section 3.2.1, methanol and THF were selected to further investigate effects of the catalyst support. It is well known that catalytic performance including selectivity, activity and stability can be influenced by catalyst type and support. It has been reported that Pd on activated carbon is more effective for debenzylation than Pd on oxide supports (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2) [7]. In this study, 5wt% Pd on different supports were tested under the standard operating conditions without buffer. Fig.4 a and c shows the effect of catalyst support on NB4FA conversion with methanol and THF as solvents, respectively. For both solvents, the highest conversion to 4FA by debenzylation (>99%) was observed for Pd/C, while both Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 showed relatively lower conversions. The effect of catalyst support on the selectivity to 4FA is shown in Fig.4b and d. Similar to the results observed from the effect of solvents (Section 3.2.1), aniline was the main by-product and almost no NBA was observed. For methanol, the selectivity tends to decrease with increasing NB4FA conversion for all catalysts. For THF, however, the selectivity decreases with time for Pd/C but remains high (∼100%) for the other two catalysts (Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3) likely because of their relatively low NB4FA conversions. 3.2.3 Effect of buffer It is known that acidic conditions favor debenzylation, while basic conditions inhibit debenzylation. Studer and Blaser reported that high selectivity to desired product by debenzylation was observed when strong acids were added [9]. The effect of pH was further investigated by David and Vannice, [7] who reported that at lower pH levels, the debenzylation pathway is predominant, while dehalogenation is favored at higher pH levels. In the present work, the effect of buffer was studied in the selected solvents and the acidity and basicity of the mixture are adjusted by acetic acid and triethylamine (TEA), respectively. As shown in Fig.5 a (methanol solvent) and c (THF solvent), it was found that acidic buffer (acetic acid) promotes the conversion of NB4FA while the reaction is significantly suppressed in the presence of basic buffer (TEA). For methanol, however, the NB4FA conversion was not enhanced noticeably by the acidic buffer, likely because of the fast reaction rates under the operating conditions. Fig.5b and d shows that the selectivity to 4FA was improved by addition of the acidic buffer for both solvents. From Fig. 5, it is apparent that 0.5vol% of acetic acid is sufficient to provide positive effects on NB4FA conversion and selectivity to 4FA in both methanol and THF."
8,Kinetic studies for hydrogenation of N-benzyl-4-fluoroaniline in methanol,"3.3 Kinetic studies for hydrogenation of N-benzyl-4-fluoroaniline in methanol Since Pd/C and methanol were found to be the best catalyst and solvent for debenzylation of NB4FA, as presented in Section 3.2, we further studied the kinetics of NB4FA hydrogenation with Pd/C and methanol by varying operating parameters such as temperature, substrate concentration and H2 pressure. In addition, 0.5vol% of acetic acid was added as the buffer, since the effects of adding acidic buffer were undetectable beyond this level. Fig. 6 shows the profiles of typical distribution of components with reaction time at the standard operating conditions. Due to the fast reaction rates observed with 0.1g Pd/C, the catalyst loading was decreased to 0.015g to study the transient reaction details. Fig. 6 clearly shows that the conversion of NB4FA to 4FA increases with time, while the aniline by-product starts to form at high NB4FA conversion. As described in Section 3.2.2, aniline was the main by-product and only trace levels of NBA (<0.01%) were detected by product analysis. It is noteworthy that the reaction generated almost exclusively the debenzylation product (4FA), but the selectivity to 4FA started to decrease at high NB4FA conversion, corresponding to high levels of 4FA, giving rise to production of aniline from 4FA defluorination. In the present work, the kinetics of two sequential reactions (I and III in Fig. 1) were investigated individually to determine the kinetic expression for each reaction. We also describe the reaction mechanism for the main reaction (I in Fig. 1, NB4FA to 4FA) using Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic models. Finally, the kinetics of the two reactions were combined to predict the complete transient reaction profiles of NB4FA hydrogenation. 3.3.1 Kinetics of N-benzyl-4-fluoroaniline debenzylation Prior to the kinetic study of NB4FA hydrogenation, a blank experiment was conducted in the absence of catalyst. It was found that the reaction rate during this test was much lower than that in the presence of the Pd catalyst. Approximately 6–8% conversion to 4FA was observed after 1h at 40°C, 5atm H2, initial substrate concentration 100μmol/ml, and 0.5vol% acetic acid as buffer. For this reason, the effect of non-catalytic hydrogenation of NB4FA was ignored in the subsequent analysis. The following range of experimental conditions was studied: temperature from 25 to 55°C, substrate concentration from 40 to 108μmol/ml, and H2 pressure from 2 to 12atm. Fig. 7 shows typical experimental results for NB4FA concentration and selectivity to 4FA with reaction time. The NB4FA conversion increases with increasing temperature and H2 pressure, and decreases with increasing substrate concentration. Fig. 7 clearly shows that the conversion of NB4FA increases while the selectivity to 4FA decreases with time, indicating that the selectivity is closely related to the NB4FA conversion. At low conversion, the NB4FA is almost exclusively converted into 4FA, while the selectivity to 4FA starts to decline with the production of aniline at high conversion. In this context, it is also important to understand the kinetics of 4FA to aniline, to enhance the yield of the desired product (4FA) while minimizing the production of the by-product (aniline). Various Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic models have been reported for hydrogenation with Pd-based catalysts, based on rate determining steps and adsorption modes of the reactants on the catalyst [7,25–27]. In this study, four Langmuir–Hinshelwood type models were considered under the following assumptions: (1) the adsorption of hydrogen is either dissociative (H) or molecular (H2), (2) the two reactants (H2, NB4FA) are adsorbed either competitively or non-competitively, and (3) the surface reaction on the adsorbed site is the rate-determining step. The rate expressions derived using these assumptions are listed in Table 4 . In order to select the reaction mechanism that best describes the kinetic data, a model parameter estimation was performed by nonlinear regression using a Marquardt algorithm by calculating the sum of the squares of the normalized deviations: (1) ∑ C NB 4 FA,measured - C NB 4 FA,calculated C NB 4 FA,measured 2 In the rate expressions in Table 4, k is the reaction rate constant, Ki the surface adsorption equilibrium constant for component i, P H 2 the pressure of H2, and C NB4FA is the concentration of NB4FA. Table 4 also presents the results of the regression. The sum of squares was lowest for Model III, suggesting that hydrogen is dissociatively adsorbed and the reactants (H2 and NB4FA) are adsorbed on different types of active sites. The constants in the rate equation were estimated using a nonlinear least-square fitting of the experimental data. Fig. 8 shows the Arrhenius plot used to estimate the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor of the reaction rate constant, k′. A similar procedure was followed for the adsorption equilibrium constants K H 2 and K NB4FA, leading to: (2) k ′ mol s · g-cat = 1.38 × 10 19 · exp - 138.4 ( kJ / mol ) RT (3) K NB 4 FA ( L / mol ) = 1.28 × 10 - 19 · exp 115.8 ( kJ / mol ) RT (4) K H 2 ( atm - 1 ) = 1.41 × 10 - 6 · exp 26.4 ( kJ / mol ) RT There are no prior reports for hydrogenation of NB4FA, hence the activation energies cannot be compared with literature values. Along with the experimental data, the lines in Fig. 7 denote the calculated results using the regressed constants (Eqs. (2)–(4)). A good fit is observed between the experimental and calculated values. Fig. 9 shows the goodness of fit in a parity plot between the experimental and predicted values for NB4FA conversion. 3.3.2 Kinetics of 4-fluoroaniline defluorination In addition to enhancing the formation rate of desired products in organic synthesis, the formation rates of by-products also need to be minimized in order to improve the yields of high valued desired products. In this context, it is important to understand the kinetics of side reactions that form undesired products. In particular, the HF by-product formed as a result of NB4FA hydrogenation has been reported to catalyze several side reactions [28]. Before developing the rate law for aniline production, the reaction pathways to form aniline were verified. During NB4FA hydrogenation, aniline can be produced by either debenzylation of NBA (Reaction IV in Fig. 1) or defluorination of 4FA (Reaction III in Fig. 1). Therefore, the hydrogenation of NBA and 4FA as initial substrates was investigated separately under the standard operating conditions. It was found that Pd/C catalyst also catalyzes debenzylation of NBA, however, the reaction rate of NBA debenzylation (TOF=2.08s− 1, 38% conversion after 5min with 0.1g Pd/C) was not fast enough to instantly form aniline under the standard operating conditions. In addition, only trace levels of NBA were detected during NB4FA hydrogenation with methanol and Pd/C in our study. From these results, it appears that aniline is produced predominantly by defluorination of 4FA. For this reason, the kinetics of 4FA defluorination was further studied to understand aniline formation. Prior to the study of 4FA hydrogenation to aniline with Pd/C catalyst, a blank experiment was carried out in the absence of catalyst. This test showed approximately 5% conversion of 4FA to aniline after 1h. As shown in Fig. 10 , interestingly, the conversion of 4FA to aniline was not influenced by the catalyst loading, indicating that the reaction is not catalyzed by Pd/C. Although there are examples of defluorination (or dehalogenation) occurring under similar hydrogenation conditions, [7,12,29] we found the formation of A from 4FA to be independent of catalyst under these conditions. The formation of aniline, however, may reflect residual amount of Pd on the reactor walls or a non-Pd catalyzed route [30–32] even after cleaning the reactor (Section 2.3). Thermal decomposition of 4FA was also reported [33] but no significant decomposition was observed in the present study. As expected, aniline was the only product detected from hydrogenation of 4FA. The kinetics of 4FA defluorination were investigated by varying the operating conditions with methanol as solvent. Similar to the kinetic study of NB4FA hydrogenation, the standard operating conditions for this study were: 40°C, 5atm H2, 0.5vol% acetic acid, 0.015g Pd/C, and 800rpm. In addition, the following range of experimental conditions was studied: temperature from 25 to 55°C, substrate concentration from 40 to 100μmol/ml, and H2 pressure from 2 to 10atm. Further, the effect of buffer was also investigated. Fig. 11 shows that the reaction rates were influenced by the operating parameters. Unlike NB4FA debenzylation, however, the effect of a basic buffer (TEA) was to enhance defluorination of 4FA while the effect of acidic buffer was not significant, as shown in Fig.11d. Due to the relatively slow reaction rate of 4FA defluorination, the following empirical power-law model was found to provide a reasonable fit to all the data that were obtained: (5) - r 4 FA ( mol / s ) = 1.15 × 10 - 4 · exp - 40.5 ( kJ / mol ) RT C 4 FA 0.89 P H 2 0.098 The curves predicted by the model are presented along with experimental data in Fig. 11a–c, indicating a good fit. As shown in Fig. 12 , the activation energy for the reaction was determined to be 40.5kJ/mol. 3.3.3 Modeling of N-benzyl-4-fluoroaniline Hydrogenation In the present work, the kinetics of two reactions (I and III in Fig. 1) were investigated individually and their reaction equations were determined by Langmuir–Hinshelwood and empirical power models, respectively. In this section, the kinetic models of these two reactions were combined to predict the complete reaction behavior of NB4FA hydrogenation. Based on the models derived, the mass balances and profiles of each component are given by the following expressions: (6) - dC NB 4 FA dt = r NB 4 FA = k ′ K H 2 0.5 K NB 4 FA P H 2 0.5 C NB 4 FA 1 + K H 2 P H 2 1 + K NB 4 FA C NB 4 FA W c (7) dC A dt = r A = kC 4 FA 0.89 P H 2 0.098 (8) dC 4 FA dt = r 4 FA = r NB 4 FA - r A (9) dC NBA dt = r NBA ≃ 0 In Eqs. (6)–(9), k′ (mol/s/g-cat) and k (mol/s) are reaction rate constants of Reactions I and III, respectively and Wc is the amount of Pd/C loaded. Note that formation of NBA was assumed to be negligible (Eq. (9)). To validate the reaction model, the concentration and selectivity profiles calculated by the model were compared with the experimental data. In Fig.13 a the experimentally obtained profiles from Fig. 6 are compared with the profiles predicted by the model, which are represented by the curves. Additional results measured at 55°C are also compared in Fig.13b. The agreement between the experiments and the model predictions is good, particularly given the assumptions in the model."
9,Conclusions,"In the present study, the kinetic details of hydrogenation of N-benzyl-4-fluoroaniline (NB4FA), as a model compound, were investigated in a semi-batch reactor. The effects of various operating parameters for Pd-based catalysts on different supports were examined to identify factors that influence the selectivity between debenzylation and defluorination pathways. It was found that polar solvents such as methanol, THF and 2-Me-THF show higher conversion of NB4FA along with higher selectivity to desired product (4FA), as compared to a non-polar solvent (toluene). The highest conversion with high selectivity to debenzylation (>99%) was observed for Pd/C, while both Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 showed relatively lower conversions. It was also found that acidic buffer (acetic acid) promotes the conversion of NB4FA while the reaction is significantly suppressed in the presence of a basic buffer (TEA). Mechanistic Langmuir–Hinshelwood models were derived and assessed by regression of the experimental data. The results showed that the debenzylation of NB4FA occurred by the surface reaction of dissociated hydrogen with NB4FA and that hydrogen and NB4FA adsorbed non-competitively on the catalytic sites of Pd/C catalyst. In order to improve the yields of high valued desired products in organic synthesis, the formation rate of desired products must be enhanced while the formation rates of by-products must be minimized. Particularly in pharmaceutical applications, it is important to achieve exceptionally high selectivity (e.g., >99%) to protect desired products and reduce purification/separation costs. For this reason, the reaction pathways to form aniline, which was observed to be the main by-product in this study, were also investigated. It appears that aniline is produced predominantly by defluorination of 4FA. Interestingly, the rate of 4FA consumption was not influenced by Pd/C catalyst loading, indicating that the reaction is not catalyzed by Pd/C under these conditions. Finally, the kinetic models of the two reactions (NB4FA debenzylation and 4FA defluorination) were combined to predict the complete reaction behavior of NB4FA hydrogenation, which showed good agreement between the experimental and predicted values. Our study shows that the conversion of NB4FA increases while the selectivity to 4FA decreases with time, indicating that the selectivity is closely related to the NB4FA conversion. For hydrogenation of NB4FA (0.015g Pd/C catalyst), Fig. 14 shows the correlation between NB4FA conversion and selectivity to 4FA, clearly showing the trade-off between the two parameters. At low conversion, the NB4FA is almost exclusively converted to 4FA, while the selectivity to 4FA starts to drop by the production of aniline at high conversion. When high catalyst loadings are utilized as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, essentially full NB4FA conversion is achieved along with nearly 100% 4FA selectivity in relatively short reaction times (<10min). The effect of catalyst amount on 4FA yield is calculated in Fig. 15 , clearly showing that both 4FA yield and kinetics increase with increasing catalyst amount. Due to pressure drop in the catalyst bed for continuous flow reactors and catalyst cost, however, the amount of catalyst loading must be minimized. In this context, there is a trade-off between 4FA yield and catalyst amount."
