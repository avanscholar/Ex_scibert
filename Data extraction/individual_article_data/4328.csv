0,Introduction,"People are interested in renewable energy worldwide and it increased in the last decade. As an alternative to gasoline or diesel engines, fuel cells are considered to have the potential to provide a clean energy source for automotive applications. Bioethanol has particularly been important since it was readily produced from renewable resources and has reasonably high hydrogen content [1]. Usually, hydrogen is obtained from fossil fuels through thermal or catalytic processes, which are inflicted to severe air pollution and CO2 emission problems. Alternatively, hydrogen from renewable sources, e.g. biomass, ethanol, and gains much attention from a point of view of ecological concern. Thus, hydrogen is considered the future fuel alternative and it will become the major energy source when fossil resources become insufficient to satisfy the global energy demand. For the past 30 years, the hydrogen separating capability of Pd alloy membranes has been well known. It was effected in utilization of Pd membranes to separate hydrogen produced in hydrocarbon reforming and coal gasification for power generation in fuel cells [2,3]. Among hydrogen production methods, such as, water electrolysis, gasification, partial oxidation reactions of heavy oil, and steam reforming reactions, the reforming of alcohols has increasingly become an important and active area of catalysis research for hydrogen production and fuel cell applications. Ethanol has several advantages compared with other raw materials but the most important is its relatively high hydrogen content, renewable origin, and the consequent reduction in CO2 emission. Deshmukh et al. [4] seek to review literature and new development in the area of membrane assisted fluidized bed reactors, with special emphasis on possible applications, integration of different membranes in the fluidized beds, reactor modeling studies, experimental demonstration of various reactor concepts, and future prospects and hurdles for commercialization. Grace et al. [5] found that the realization of the fluidized bed membrane reactors process for hydrogen production required that a number of unusual challenges in reactor design be met. Using a novel autothermal circulating fluidized bed membrane reactor (ACFBMR), Chen and Elnashaie studied the hydrogen production by steam reforming of heavy hydrocarbons and found that the design and operating parameters of the reformer have important impacts on its performance [6]. Using Sahoo et al's [7] kinetic model, Gallucci et al. [8] simulated the ethanol steam reforming reaction in a Pd–Ag membrane reactor and found that the membrane reactor is superior to the traditional reactor regarding to ethanol conversion and hydrogen production, over the whole range of W/F and lumen pressure tested. Gallucci et al. conducted the comparisons of conversion and hydrogen selectivity for steam reforming of methanol and ethanol, at H2O/alcohol=4.5, over 5% Rh/Al2O3 catalysts in a traditional reactor and porous and dense membrane reactors and discussed the effects of temperature, sweep gas and flow rate [9]. On performing steam reforming of methanol in membrane reactor to produce hydrogen, Basile et al. [10] used a flat Pd–Ag membrane to remove hydrogen from the reaction side and demonstrated that the methanol conversion and the hydrogen production were increased and Co selectivity was reduced as a low amount of oxygen was fed to the reactor. In this study, ethanol was fed with water and oxygen to produce hydrogen by the autothermal reforming reaction in a Pd–Ag membrane reactor, which has not been reported before. Some other reactions (water–gas shift reaction and decomposition) may also occur at the same time. The combustion reaction of mixed ethanol–air is highly exothermic and yields acetaldehyde and ethylene, and also coke and soot, which are severe poisons to fuel cell electrodes. The steam reforming reaction (C2H5OH+H2O→2CO+4H2, ΔH r =+255.54kJ/mol) is strongly endothermic, requiring an external energy to heat the reactor to the 1073K, that is necessary to achieve high conversion at residence times of ∼1s [11–17]. The water–gas shift reaction (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2, ΔH r =−41.16kJ/mol) has a favorable H2 equilibrium only at a lower temperature and with large amounts of water added [18]. Ideally, to perform the partial oxidation with stream reforming of ethanol combined with the water–gas shift reaction [19] will take advantage of the heat generated by the oxidation reaction required for the energy consumption of the steam reforming reaction and of a thermodynamically unlimited H2 production in a palladium–silver membrane reactor. Abashar et al. [20] indicated that the staging distribution of oxygen enables one to control the hot-spot temperatures and to operate the reactor under safer operability conditions in contradistinction to the possibility of thermal runaway for the conventional co-feed mode of operation. The purpose of this communication is to study the effect of oxygen on hydrogen production from ethanol steam reforming reaction in a palladium alloy compose membrane reactor."

2,Characterization of porous stainless steel (PSS) substrate,"2.1 Characterization of porous stainless steel (PSS) substrate Liquid expulsion permporometry [21], a very simple and well-established method, has become a standard technique used by suppliers to measure the largest active pores (as well as cracks or pinholes) in a membrane. The principle is to measure the pressure needed to force air through a liquid-filled membrane. The bottom of the filter is in contact with air and, as the air pressure is gradually increased, air bubbles penetrate through the membrane at a certain pressure. The pressure and pore radius is related by the Laplace equation: (1) r p = 2 γ cos θ Δ P where r p is the radius of a capillary shaped pore and γ is the surface tension at the liquid/air interface (γ (water/air) =7.23×10−2 N/m). An air bubble will pass through the pore when its radius is equal to that of the pore, assuming that the contact angle is zero. Penetration will first occur through the largest pores and since the pressure is known, the pore radius can be calculated by Laplace equation. In this study, a PSS-316L tube (Pall Corp.; separation grade, 0.2μm) with a 3/8in. diameter, pore-size distribution about 2μm and effect area about 20cm2 was used as the substrate. The morphology and pore-size distribution of the PSS substrates are shown in Fig. 1 . The characterizations of stainless steel substrate were described in the previous work [22,23]."
3,Preparation of Pd–Ag/PSS composite membrane,"2.2 Preparation of Pd–Ag/PSS composite membrane Pd–Ag/PSS membranes were prepared using the conventional electroless plating method [24]. The activation procedure using palladium chloride as the metal precursor was applied to form some Pd nuclei in the pores. The plating step had been repeated until the desired thickness of the membrane was achieved. After each deposition, the membrane was sintered and annealed in hydrogen atmospheres at 723K for more than 18h [22]. The final film thickness of the dense Pd/Ag membrane is 20μm and Pd/Ag weight ratio of 78/22. In our previous study we found that the conversion of ethanol in the Pd membrane reactor was higher than that in the conventional reactor, but the Pd–Ag alloy membrane reactor gave the highest conversion. The conversion of both the Pd membrane reactor and Pd–Ag alloy membrane reactor exceeded the equilibrium value when temperature was below 673K. This was due to the hydrogen being removed from the reactor lumen to the permeation side, which boosted a higher ethanol conversion to produce more hydrogen; therefore, the ethanol conversion was exceeding than the thermodynamic equilibrium value specified in a traditional reactor [24]."
4,Steam reforming reaction of ethanol through Pd–Ag membrane reactor,"2.3 Steam reforming reaction of ethanol through Pd–Ag membrane reactor The schematic diagram of ethanol steam reforming reaction apparatus is shown in Fig. 2 . The membrane module is consisted of two concentric tubes, in which the membrane tube is located inside the outer stainless steel tube, with an annular space in between as the reaction zone. Hydrogen produced in the reactor zone permeates through the membrane into the permeation chamber (permeation side). All the gases coming into the system are controlled by mass flow controller, and the exit gases are measured by a bubble flow meter and analyzed by GC. The steam reforming reaction of ethanol occurred in the shell side of a palladium membrane reactor in which 4.6g Zn–Cu/Al2O3 commercial catalyst (or MDC-3 that was provided by Nissan Girdler, Japan) was packed. The mixture of ethanol–water with a molar rate, n water/n ethanol =1 or 3, and oxygen (n oxygen/n ethanol =0.2 or 0.7) was preheated and mixed well before it was fed concurrently into the reaction side of the membrane reactor. The reaction temperatures were set at 593–723K and the pressures 3–10atm (pressure of gauge). All experimental data were collected several hours after the steady-state conditions had reached. Catalytic activity was measured in terms of ethanol conversion and defined as (2) X = F ethanol in − F ethanol out F ethanol in × 100 % Products distributions were evaluated through their selectivity and the selectivity of specie i was defined as (3) S i = 1 ν i F i out F ethanol in − F ethanol out × 100 % where F i is the molar flow rate of species i and ν i is the stoichiometric coefficients of species i. Besides, the selectivity of hydrogen is defined as (4) S H 2 = 1 6 F H 2 out F ethanol in × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,"When ethanol, water, and oxygen are co-fed into a reactor loaded with active Cu–Zn catalyst, many reactions, which may be parallel or competing, will occur over the catalyst. These include: Steam reforming reaction: (5) C H 3 C H 2 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 6 H 2 , Δ H r 298 = 173.22 kJ/mol (6) C H 3 C H 2 OH + H 2 O → 2 CO + 4 H 2 , Δ H r 298 = 255.54 kJ/mol Partial oxidation reaction: (7) C H 3 C H 2 OH + ( 3 / 2 ) O 2 → 2 C O 2 + 3 H 2 , Δ H r 298 = − 552.21 kJ/mol (8) C H 3 C H 2 OH + ( 1 / 2 ) O 2 → 2 CO + 3 H 2 , Δ H r 298 = 13.73 kJ/mol Water–gas shift reaction: (9) CO + H 2 O → C O 2 + H 2 , Δ H r 298 = − 41.16 kJ/mol For autothermal reforming of ethanol (ΔH r =0) at 298K and 623K, respectively, the latter of which is at the reaction temperature, we have (10) C H 3 C H 2 OH + 0.6 O 2 + 1.8 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 4.8 H 2 , Δ H r 298 = 0 kJ/mol (11) C H 3 C H 2 OH + 0.4 O 2 + 2.2 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 5.2 H 2 , Δ H r 623 = 0 kJ/mol Intraparticle diffusion can be minimized as the particle size is reduced to the extant, not to induce enormous pressure gradient across the catalyst bed or when an egg-shell coating catalyst which shortens the diffusion length of reactants is used. The variations of the ethanol conversion in a traditional reactor and a membrane reactor with different oxygen addition are clearly shown in Fig. 3 . The ethanol conversions in the traditional reactor increase with increasing oxygen addition, but are lower than the ones in a membrane reactor at the same molar flow rate. This positive effects of the membrane reactor in obtaining high ethanol conversion are also cited in Basile et al. [25–27] recently published experimental results. In Figs. 4 and 5 variations of the conversion of ethanol at four different mixed steams with pressure and temperature are illustrated and their values are listed in Table 1 . The ethanol conversions, when no oxygen is present, increase with increasing temperature, but slightly decrease with an increase of the operating pressure. Ethanol conversion increases from 39% at n water/n ethanol =1 to ca. 65% at n water/n ethanol =3, which abides by the Le Chatelier's principle for an endothermic steam reforming reaction, as shown in Fig. 4(A). But when we raise the temperature from 623K to 723K, at n water/n ethanol =1, the ethanol conversion increases from 38–40% to 77%–81%, as shown in Fig. 4(B). As a small amount of oxygen (n oxygen/n ethanol =0.2) with equal molar feed rate of ethanol and water (n water/n ethanol =1) is fed into the reactor, the conversion of ethanol can reach to about 62–70%. It can be seen that at 623K the ethanol conversion increases with the addition of the oxygen, while it remains almost unchanged at a high temperature T =723K. The steam-to-ethanol ratio has a similar effect on ethanol conversion as shown in Fig. 4(B). The WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) of ethanol reported in this study is the hourly weight of inlet ethanol over loaded catalyst weight. At 593K and at WHSV=5h−1, ethanol conversion increases with increasing water feed (n water/n ethanol =1–3) and decreasing pressure, which abides by the Le Chatelier's principle for an endothermic steaming reforming reaction, as shown in Fig. 5(A). When low oxygen is fed (n oxygen/n ethanol =0.2) into the reactor, the conversion of ethanol can reach to about 62–70%. However, when more oxygen is added (n oxygen/n ethanol =0.7) into the reactor, the ethanol conversion decreases with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 5(B). It can be seen that the ethanol conversion increases with an increase of the oxygen addition and operating temperature. However, the increase in ethanol conversion is not noticeable in higher operating temperature. This positive effect of the operating temperature on ethanol conversion is similar to some published experimental results on methane conversion [28]. Due to its endothermic for a steam reforming reaction, the conversion of ethanol is higher at higher temperatures than that at lower temperatures, as shown in Fig. 6(A). Oxidative steam reforming reaction gains the merit that the heat evolved from the exothermic partial oxidation can supply for the need of endothermic steam reforming reaction and it is more suitable with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure than the steaming reforming reaction. Because more heat is necessary for steam reforming, the conversion of ethanol at a higher temperature is higher than that at a lower temperature, as shown in Fig. 6(B). According to the Le Chatelier's principle, the oxidative steam reforming reaction is more suitable with decreasing temperature and decreasing pressure than the steam reforming reaction. Regarding the hydrogen production, at low oxygen feed and normal water–ethanol feed (n ethanol:n water:n oxygen =1:1:0.2) and WHSV=5h−1, the hydrogen flux increases with increasing temperature and increasing pressure, especially at 9atm, as shown in Fig. 7(A). The final net effect of the operating pressure on the ethanol conversion consists of a negative effect on the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations due to increasing volume at a higher operating pressure and a positive effect on the increasing hydrogen removal ratio at a higher operating pressure. Hydrogen production that is collected at permeation side increases with increasing temperature and increasing pressure, especially in 9atm, as shown in Fig. 7(B). The final enhancement effect of the operating pressure on the ethanol conversion results from at the higher operating pressure is a negative effect due to the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation and a positive effect due to the increasing hydrogen removal ratio which boosts the forward reaction. The influence of membrane on the enhancement of conversion of ethanol was described in the previous work [24]. The effect of WHSV on hydrogen flux is shown in Fig. 8 . At the lower temperature (593K), since the reforming activity is pretty low, decreasing WHSV or lengthening contact time does not apparently affect the hydrogen flux. While at the higher temperature (723K), increasing WHSV causes a slight reduction in ethanol conversion, but the hydrogen yield which is defined as the product of ethanol feed rate and conversion is still increasing due to increasing WHSV. At high WHSVs, the reaction system does not reach the thermodynamic equilibrium so that the conversion is lower than the thermodynamic one, while at low WHSVs the reaction system is in equilibrium. So the enhancement of the conversion depends on the amount of hydrogen removed from the reactive medium. The oxygen addition plays an important role on the steam reforming of ethanol. If insufficient amount of oxygen is added, it will not initiate oxidation reaction, the ethanol steam reforming will remain dominating. As shown in Fig. 9(A) and (B), the selectivity of CO and CO2 barely increase with increasing temperature, typically for endothermic steam reforming reaction. Some byproducts, such as methane, ethylene, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl ether are also detected in trivial amount and CO and CO2 total amount is less than 20%. Although ethanol, water, and oxygen are co-fed to the membrane reactor for the autothermal reaction, if the amount of oxygen is not enough to initiate oxidation reaction, it would be likely that the ethanol steam reforming dominates just like the situation shown in Fig. 10(A) and (B), in which the selectivities of CO and CO2 increase with increasing temperature, typically for the endothermic steam reforming reaction. However, due to the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation, the high-temperature reforming produces a large amount of CO and CO2. When the oxygen in feed is raised (n oxygen/n ethanol =0.7), Fig. 11 shows that at different pressures the selectivities of CO and CO2 vary with the amount of oxygen added to the reactor. The temperature does not retain a substantial effect on the production of CO and CO2 at high pressures. When the oxygen in feed is raised (n oxygen/n ethanol =0.2 or 0.7), Fig. 9 shows that at different pressures the selectivities of CO and CO2 vary with the amount of oxygen added to the reactor. The selectivity of CO2 increases with increased flux of oxygen, while the selectivity of CO remains almost the same, both of which approach to a constant value at the high pressure, P =9atm, if irrespective of the temperature variations. Although the hydrogen flux to the permeation side proportionately increases with increasing pressure, it slightly reduces with increasing oxygen input. This is probably due to the fast oxidation reaction that consumes hydrogen before the onset of the steam reforming reaction."
6,Conclusion,"Membrane separation technology is regarded nowadays as a preferred method for production of high quality hydrogen. In this study, a Pd–Ag/PSS membrane reactor was used for production of hydrogen through the oxidative steam reforming of ethanol. A facile Zn–Cu commercial catalyst, MDC-3, was used to perform the steam reforming of ethanol with oxygen addition in a palladium–silver membrane reactor while some other supported cobalt catalysts with CeO2 as promoters are being tested in our lab in order to achieve an optimization of hydrogen yield. Ethanol–water mixture (n water/n ethanol =1 or 3) and oxygen (n oxygen/n ethanol =0.2 or 0.7) were fed concurrently into the membrane reactor. The reaction temperatures were set at 593–723K and the pressures 3–10atm. Temperature effect associated with the heat of reaction that influences on reaction paths is thoroughly examined. The hydrogen production from ethanol steam reforming reaction is judged with the amount of oxygen addition. The amount of oxygen addition in the feed has a significant effect on the steam reforming reaction of ethanol. The selectivity of CO2 increased with increasing flow rate of oxygen, while the selectivity of CO remained almost the same. The hydrogen flux to the permeation side proportionately increased with increasing pressure; however, it reduced slightly with increasing oxygen input. This is probably due to the fast oxidation reaction that consumes hydrogen before the onset of the steam reforming reaction."
