0,Introduction,"Woody biomass is the most abundant biomass in the world. In the actual context of intensive quest for environmental friendly energy sources, the woody biomass and especially the wood wastes resulted from forest activities is of special interest. A superior way to add value to these wastes is their transformation in the second generation bio-ethanol, as a way for further transformation in hydrogen and/or syngas. In the actual technologies, the hydrogen generation from lignocelluloses biomass is a two stage process: in the first step raw biomass is converted to hydrogen substrate (i.e. ethanol) and in the second step this is catalytically transformed into hydrogen [1]. Hydrogen is often called “the fuel of the future” although it is not exactly a fuel but an energy vector. Hydrogen is foreseen by many researchers as a very suitable and environmentally friendly energy carrier [2] due to its possibility to be used in fuel cells for stationary and mobile power generation with practically no hazardous emissions [3]. The so called “hydrogen economy” seems to be a viable alternative in the future to replace the actual fossil fuel based one [4]. Woody biomass has a complex structure having as main components cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Generally, the process of the bio-ethanol production includes four steps: pretreatment, hydrolysis, fermentation and distillation [5]. Autohydrolysis pretreatment with compressed hot water is an environmental friendly process in which the selective depolymerization of hemicellulose takes place [6]. Hemicellulose is easy recovered in the liquid fraction as mono- and oligosugars, and cellulose and lignin are separated in the solid fraction (cellulose is more susceptible to hydrolysis). The remaining lignin fraction has a higher affinity for cellulolytic enzymes components, thus resulting in reduced hydrolysis efficiency. Therefore, the intercalation of an intermediate step of delignification may be an effective method to promote enzymatic digestibility of wood [7]. The hydrolysis of cellulose is primarily performed either through a chemical or an enzymatic route; in this hydrolysis step cellulose is broken into monomers. The acid hydrolysis is much faster than the enzymatic hydrolysis, this representing an economic advantage. Potential acids that can be used in acid hydrolysis are sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, in concentrate or dilute form [8]. Previous studies showed that dilute acids significantly improve the cellulose hydrolysis, but require high temperature and neutralization of pH [9]. The resulted sugars are fermented to ethanol. Enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation can be performed together in the so-called simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) or separately, in two steps: hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF). The usual route for ethanol transformation into hydrogen is the steam reforming (ESR). Being a catalytic process, the importance of the catalytic materials is well established. The most used catalysts are noble (Rh, Pt, Pd, Au, Ag) [10,11] and non-noble (Ni, Co, Cu) [12,13] metals supported on various oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2). Noble metals have the advantage of high catalytic activity and stability, their main drawback being the high production costs. Ni based catalysts are very active for reformation reactions and often used for ESR, their main drawback being the relatively rapid deactivation due to carbon deposition. A series of approaches have been taken to overcome this problem: (i) the addition of small quantities of noble metal to Ni, the resulting bimetallic catalysts presenting improved stability and selectivity for H2 formation [14]; (ii) the modification of support by addition of other oxides (CaO, MgO, CeO2, La2O3, etc) [15–17]. This paper reports for the first time to our best knowledge a comprehensive study of crude bio-ethanol production from fir wood wastes and its subsequent transformation in hydrogen by ethanol steam reforming. Epron et al. reported the steam reforming of a model raw bio-ethanol mixture obtained by the addition of the most common impurities to a solution of ethanol; the composition of crude bio-ethanol obtained in our work is very different from that reported by the group of Epron [18]. In previous papers, the term of bio-ethanol usually defines the pure ethylic alcohol obtained by crop fermentation followed by distillation. In our paper the term of crude bio-ethanol defines the liquid part of the fermentation broth, which contains all the fermentation products, not only ethanol."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bio-ethanol production,"2.1 Bio-ethanol production 2.1.1 Materials The fir (Albies alba) wood wastes were collected locally and used as raw material. The dried material was stored in plastic bags at room temperature. Yeast from Saccharomyces cerevisiae YSC2 and peptone from animal tissue P5905 were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). H2SO4 (98%), CH3–COOH, NaOH, KH2PO4, MgSO4·7H2O, (NH4)2SO4 citric acid (C6H8O7) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). NaClO2 (80%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar GmbH & Co (Karlsruhe, Germany). All chemicals were analytical reagent grade. Ultrapure water was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The scheme for bio-ethanol production considered in this work is presented in Fig. 1 . 2.1.2 Autohydrolysis pretreatment The pretreatment of wood was carried out in a steel pressure Parr reactor with a Parr 4523 temperature controller (Parr Instruments, Illinois, USA). The raw material was loaded into a 1 L reaction vessel and was supplemented with an appropriate amount of deionized water to obtain a final solid to liquid ratio of 1:7. The mixture was heated at 190 °C and 60 bar pressure for 10 min residence time. At the end of the reaction, the reactor was cooled and the mixture was separated by filtration into the solid residue and the liquid phase. The pretreatment conditions were selected based on preliminary results, according to our previously published method [19]. 2.1.3 Delignification of cellulosic materials The solid materials recovered after pretreatment were delignified using acid-chlorite method, according to Hallac et al. [20]. The experiments were carried out in 250 mL conical flasks using sodium chlorite (0.6 g/g biomass), acetic acid (0.6 mL/g biomass) and deionized water (84 mL/g biomass). The reactions were carried out at 70 °C for 2 h (repeated for 3 times). The suspension was filtered, washed with water and acetone until neutral pH. The delignified materials were hydrolyzed with dilute acid followed by fermentation (route II in Fig. 1), or subjected directly to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) (route I in Fig. 1) in order to obtain the crude bioethanol. 2.1.4 Dilute acid hydrolysis followed by fermentation of acid hydrolyzate Acid hydrolysis experiments of the solid residue recovered after delignification of wood were carried out in two steps: (i) in 500 mL conical flasks containing 2% H2SO4 at 100 °C for 60 min, and (ii) in 15% H2SO4 at 100 °C, for 90 min. After the hydrolysis process, the liquid fractions were separated from unreacted solids and then fermented to bioethanol. The amount of acid used for cellulosic fraction hydrolysis was 38 g of H2SO4 to 2 g of dry solid. The fermentation of acid hydrolyzate was performed in 1 L flasks containing 700 mL hydrolyzate obtained above, 70 mL nutrient solution (medium content per liter: 5 g of yeast extract, 20 g of KH2PO4, 10 g of MgSO4.7H2O, 20 g of (NH4)2SO4 and 1 g of MgSO4.7H2O), and 70 mL inoculum solution (medium content per liter: 10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of peptone and 50 g of glucose). The initial pH was adjusted to 5.0 by adding NaOH (2 M). All the experiments were carried out at 30 °C for 72 h. The nutrient solution and the inoculum solution were activated and grown at 30 °C for 24 h in an incubator. During the fermentation process, samples were collected to determine the content of ethanol and acetic acid. 2.1.5 Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) processes were carried out in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a bubble trap to maintain anaerobic conditions and placed in an orbital shaker (250 rpm). The fermentation flask contained 20 mL nutrient solution, 20 mL inoculum solution, mixed with 8% (w/v) solids loadings in citrate buffer (0.05 M) and 0.7 mL/g glucan of Accellerase 1500 (Genencor, Rochester, NY, USA) at pH 4.8. All SSF experiments were performed at 45 °C for 96 h."
3,Hydrogen production,"2.2 Hydrogen production 2.2.1 Catalyst preparation The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (denoted as Ni/Al) was prepared by wet impregnation method. The γ-Al2O3 (Merck, Germany) was impregnated with the proper amount of aqueous solution obtained from commercially available Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alpha Aesar, Germany). The impregnated catalyst samples were dried at room temperature overnight, calcined in Ar at 650 °C for 4 h and reduced in H2 at 650 °C for another 4 h. The mixed catalysts (Ni/La2O3–Al2O3 with 6 wt% La2O3 denoted as Ni/La–Al and Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 with 6 wt% CeO2 denoted as Ni/Ce–Al), were prepared in two successive stages. The first stage of the preparation consisted in alumina impregnation with aqueous solution of La(NO3)3·6H2O (Merck, Germany) or Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Merck, Germany), followed by calcination at 650 °C for 4 h. The second stage consisted in further impregnation of the freshly modified supports with aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O following the procedure described for Ni/Al. The target concentration of Ni in all catalyst was 10 wt%. 2.2.2 Catalysts characterization N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded in order to determine the total surface area (S t ), pore volume (V p ) and pore radius (r p ) using the Sorptomatic 1990 (Thermo Electron Corporation USA). X-ray power diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer with CuKα1 radiation, operation voltage 40 kV and current 40 mA. The average Ni crystallite size was assessed using the Scherrer equation. The reduction profile of the catalyst precursors were investigated by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) on TPDRO 1100 instrument from Thermo Scientific, USA. The calcined catalyst samples were placed inside a quartz tube reactor which was then heated from room temperature to 1100 °C under a gaseous mixture of 10% of H2/Ar with a flow rate of 20 mL/min. The rate of H2 consumption was measured by the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) was performed on the same TPDRO 1100 equipment in order to investigate the nature and quantity of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface during bio-ethanol steam reforming. The catalyst samples were cleaned under He flow (20 mL/min) for 30 min at 30 °C, and then heated up to 1100 °C by a temperature rate of 10 °C/min, under 20 mL/min flow of 7% O2/He. 2.2.3 Hydrogen production by bio-ethanol catalytic steam reforming Crude bio-ethanol steam reforming reaction was studied in a Microactivity Reference Unit (PID Eng & Tech, Spain) in a stainless steel reactor (i.d. = 9 mm) under atmospheric pressure. Argon, the carrier gas, is controlled by a mass flow controller and the liquid reagents are measured and controlled by an LC 6A pump (Shimadzu, Japan). The liquid mixture passes first through a pre-heater at 120 °C and then into the reactor. The reaction products collected at the reactor outlet are a mixture of liquid and gaseous fractions. The liquid fraction is removed through condensation and from time to time samples are collected and analyzed in the analytical conditions presented bellow. The gaseous fraction is dried by passing it through silica and then analyzed online using a GC (Sferocarb column 2 m, 80–100 mesh with Ar as a carrier gas at 120 °C) equipped with a TCD. Prior to experiments, the catalyst samples (1 g) were diluted with alumina (1 g) and activated by reduction in H2 for 3 h at 350 °C. The catalytic activity experiments were performed between 150 and 350 °C, the total flow for Ar was set to 133 mL/min, and the liquid feed (crude bio-ethanol) was tested in a range of 0.1–1 mL/min. The ethanol and acetic acid conversions were calculated based on inlet and outlet concentrations. (1) X EtOH = C EtOH in − C EtOH out C EtOH in × 100 (2) X AcH = C AcH in − C AcH out C AcH in × 100 where C EtOH in , C AcH in and C EtOH out , C AcH out represent the inlet and the outlet concentrations of ethanol and acetic acid, respectively. Hydrogen production is defined as volume of H2 produced in 1 min on 1 g of catalyst."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Ethanol concentration was evaluated using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a CTC Combi PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The method used for bio-ethanol analysis is full evaporation headspace gas chromatographic method (FE–HS–GC). The advantage of this method is that it uses small volumes of samples (10 μl): the liquid sample is introduced into the headspace sample vial and it is then heated up to a temperature of 105 °C, when a full evaporation can be achieved within 3 min. The concentration of acetic acid was determined by ion chromatography (IC), using a Metrohm 761 Compact IC (Metrohm Ltd., Switzerland) system with suppressed conductivity detection and a Metrosep A Supp 5–100 analytical column. For the IC system, a mixture of Na2CO3 (0.0027 mol/L) and NaHCO3 (0.001 mol/L) was employed as eluent, with a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Crude bio-ethanol preparation and analysis,"3.1 Crude bio-ethanol preparation and analysis The fir wood contains approximately 70% carbohydrates, being thus a suitable feedstock for bio-ethanol production. The composition of wood samples used in this study was analyzed, and results showed that it is composed of cellulose (46.0%), hemicellulose (24.0%), lignin (28.4%), ash (0.3%) and extractible (1.3%). Bio-ethanol was prepared from fir wood by two processes using two types of hydrolysis: (i) acid hydrolysis followed by fermentation of acid hydrolyzate and (ii) simultaneous saccharification and fermentation combined in SSF process. Prior to these processes the delignification of autohydrolyzed wood was applied for elimination of lignin from cellulosic materials. The SSF method applied to fir wood wastes is a novelty of this paper and the combination of autohydrolysis and SSF in order to produce crude bio-ethanol from fir wood, to our best knowledge, was not reported before. The material balance for the crude bio-ethanol obtained from wood wastes using two different hydrolysis procedures is shown in Fig. 2 . Autohydrolysis pre-treatment was applied for the removal of hemicellulose in liquid fraction and recovery of cellulose and lignin in solid fraction. The yield of the solid fraction recovered after autohydrolysis was 75.0%. The content of cellulose (57.8%) and lignin (37.8%) in the autohydrolyzed wood confirmed that both components were recovered in solid fraction, only a small amount of hemicellulose (3.3%) being identified in this fraction. In order to reduce the lignin content, delignification with sodium chlorite was applied in the present work. The solid yield after delignification was 43.0%, lignin being almost totally removed. Acid hydrolysis and SSF method were used for hydrolysis and fermentation of delignified wood to crude bio-ethanol. During SSF method the Accelerase 1500 enzymes convert cellulose into monomeric sugars. These are further fermented to bio-ethanol by yeast cells through glycolytic and fermentation enzymes. It was reported that the factors that affect the production of bio-ethanol from palm oil, in SSF process are: solid loading, pH, yeast concentration, the nutrient content, etc. [21]. In order to increase the final ethanol concentration in the SSF process, different solid loadings, temperatures and time of the process were tested. Firstly, the solid loading was 2% (w/v) and the temperature was 35 °C. In this case the final ethanol concentration was 33 g/L. The maximum ethanol concentration (43.69 g/L) was obtained for SSF process with 8% (w/v) solid loadings at 45 °C after a period of 94 h. In the acid hydrolysis method with H2SO4, a high concentration of bio-ethanol (37.53 g/L) was obtained using 2% of acid concentration for 60 min and 15% of acid hydrolysis for 90 min. The temperature in all experiments was 100 °C. The acid hydrolysis in two stages was used for a low degradation of cellulose. Approximately the same final bio-ethanol concentrations were obtained in all parallel experiments. In the SSF process, the concentration of ethanol is slightly increased compared to acid hydrolysis, while the acetic acid concentration is higher for acid hydrolysis. From these results it can be deduced that ethanol production is influenced by the hydrolysis method performed on autohydrolyzed wood. The unpurified fermentation broth obtained from wood wastes by the two described methods is a dark mixture of many different compounds containing, besides the liquid fraction, a solid fraction composed by nutrients, inoculum solutions and remains of raw material. Some purification is needed before being suitable to be used for steam reforming. For this purpose some methods were investigated and the final purification scheme included: (i) filtration for obtaining a clear solution and (ii) heating the sample followed by condensation of all liquid products. The clear solution obtained after filtration still contains dissolved salts and yeast which remain as a solid residue after the second step of purification. The separation of the liquid part recovers all the organic components plus water. The liquid solution obtained after purification, denominated as crude bio-ethanol, was analyzed according to the procedure described in the Experimental Section. Two major compounds were identified in crude bio-ethanol: ethanol and acetic acid (Table 1 ). In addition, a wide range of alcohols, acids, esters, ethers and aldehydes were also identified. The presence of all these components in crude bio-ethanol was confirmed by GC-FID analysis. Their concentration is much lower than those corresponding to ethanol and acetic acid and varies with the hydrolysis method. The acetic acid content is important in all samples obtained by each preparation method. Its high content is due to the presence of oxygen during fermentation. The yeast S. cerevisiae was able to effectively utilize glucose to produce a significant amount of ethanol, but also a wide spectrum of other biological metabolites. These properties are partially based on the presence of a highly efficient alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) (for oxidizing acetaldehyde to ethanol). The liquid solution produced by acid hydrolysis and by SSF process contain sufficient amount of carbon source, nitrogen, minerals and nutrients to also produce different chemicals. The accumulation of acetyl CoA (as a result of limited activity of Krebs cycle enzymes) may explain the accumulation and release of acetate esters (methyl propanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, etc.) during fermentation. In addition, the formation of other compounds (higher alcohols: n-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, n-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, pentanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, etc.) is due to the presence of nitrogen sources in fermentation medium. This property is partially dependent on the fermentation temperature, and is reflected in yeast growth potential [22]. In case of the acid hydrolysis the concentration of acetic acid is higher (16.36 g/L), representing more than 40% of the ethanol concentration. The highest ethanol concentration of 43.69 g/L was obtained in the SSF method, while by acid hydrolysis the concentration of ethanol was 37.53 g/L. These values demonstrate a good yeast performance during the SSF process. The ethanol concentrations obtained in this work are similar or even higher than those reported in the literature for a wide range of lignocellulosic feed stocks (Table 2 ). The presence of significant concentrations of acetic acid and low concentrations of other oxygenated molecules in crude bio-ethanol prepared in this work is not a drawback of the preparation method, as the aim of this study is to produce hydrogen and the reformation of all hydrogen containing molecules is foreseen."
7,Catalytic hydrogen production from crude bio-ethanol,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogen production from crude bio-ethanol The purified crude bio-ethanol was used without any other changes for the production of hydrogen by catalytic steam reforming. For this study a common 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst obtained by impregnation and two promoted alumina supported Ni catalysts were used. Similar catalysts prepared by the same methods were used by our group for studies on methane steam reforming, being fully characterized by: N2 adsorption-desorption, H2 chemisorption, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) [28,29]. In the next section, the main catalysts characteristics are presented in order to have a general view of the catalytic materials used for bio-ethanol steam reforming. The addition of La2O3 and CeO2 to the alumina support did not have a major influence on its porous structure. Total surface area has very similar values for all catalysts, being 105 m2/g for Ni/Al, 103 m2/g for Ni/Ce–Al and 100 m2/g for Ni/La–Al. The pore's mean diameter is 50 Å for all studied catalysts, which places these materials in the mesoporous domain. These textural properties ensure good access of reagents molecules to the catalyst surface and to the catalytic active centers. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) method was used to evaluate the influence of the additional oxide to the reduction properties of supported NiO. It is known that the interaction of Ni nanoparticles with the support derives from the interaction of NiO precursor with the catalysts support. The strength and type of this interaction can be assessed from the reduction temperature of supported NiO. It is important to notice that for all three catalysts the TPR profile is a resultant of several reduction peaks, situated at different temperatures (Fig. 3 ). The overlapping peaks are deconvoluted using Gaussian-type function. Applying the mathematical function to the temperature profile, resulted in the identification of the reduction peaks depicted in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table 3 . It can be observed that the addition of the extra oxide to the alumina support leads to a decrease in temperature profile from 762 °C in Ni/Al to 749 °C in Ni/Ce–Al and 664 °C in Ni/La–Al. Besides, the appearance of two peaks of low intensity situated at lower temperatures, 169 °C for Ni/La–Al and 275 °C for Ni/Ce–Al should also be mentioned (Fig. 3). These peaks may be attributed to low amounts of NiO bulk species with very low interaction with the support which generate large Ni particles after reduction of NiO. According to [30] and [31] the peaks situated between 350 and 600 °C correspond to NiO species very well dispersed on the surface of the catalyst and having low to medium interaction with the support. The peaks situated between 650 and 800 °C, which represent the main reduction peaks of the studied catalysts, can be attributed to nickel oxide – aluminum oxide non–stoichiometric mixed species. Peaks with values close to the beginning of the range can be a nickel–aluminum oxide mixture which contains a Ni-rich phase with Al3+ ions. In contrast, the peaks that are situated in the upper part of the interval are formed from Al-rich phase with Ni2+ ions. The interaction of these mixed oxides with the support is medium to strong. The peaks situated at the highest temperature resulted from deconvolution are of low intensity (Table 3) and may very well correspond to low amounts of NiAl2O4 spinel which has very strong interaction with the support [32]. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was used to evaluate the crystallinity of the catalyst components and to estimate the size of Ni nanoparticles. The presence of Ni is confirmed in XRD patterns (not shown here, see reference [28]) of all catalysts by its characteristic peaks situated at 44.5° for Ni (111), 51.8° for Ni (2 0 0) and 76.5° for Ni (2 2 0). The peak attributed to NiO and situated at 37.3° and 43.3° are not present in the Ni/Al diffractograms, suggesting that all NiO was reduced to metallic state. For Ni/La–Al the XRD peaks attributed to La-containing phases are absent. This is due to the fact that lanthanum oxide is very well dispersed on the catalyst surface [28,33]. In Ni/Ce–Al diffraction patterns the presence of well crystallized CeO2 is confirmed by the peaks situated at: 28.5° for CeO2 (1 1 1), 33° for CeO2 (2 0 0), 47.3° for CeO2 (2 2 0) and 56.7° for CeO2 (3 1 1). The Ni crystallite size was determined from Ni (2 0 0) diffraction peak using Scherrer equation. For Ni/Al the Ni crystallite size was evaluated at 11.7 nm, for Ni/La–Al at 8.0 nm and for Ni/Ce–Al at 8.8 nm. It may be concluded that the additional oxide improves the Ni dispersion by lowering the Ni crystallite size. The conclusion of the characterization section is that the addition of 6 wt% of La2O3 or CeO2 to alumina modifies the interaction of Ni with the catalytic support leading to a better catalyst reducibility and a better Ni dispersion on the support. The main reactions which are expected to take place in the catalytic steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol are: - Ethanol steam reforming: CH3–CH2–OH + 3H2O → 6H2 + 2CO2 (1) - Acetic acid steam reforming: CH3–COOH + 2H2O → 4H2 + 2CO2 (2) Besides these, a big number of secondary reactions also take place involving decomposition, dehydration, dehydrogenation, water-gas shift, reformation of secondary products etc [34]. The reformation of the crude bio-ethanol was performed in a stainless steel fixed-bed tubular catalytic reactor (i.d. = 0.9 mm). Two parameters were tested in order to optimize the reaction conditions for maximum hydrogen production: the reaction temperature and the feed rate of bio-ethanol. The study was started with the influence of crude bio-ethanol feed rate on the conversion. For this, Ni/Al catalyst was tested at 350 °C. For this study, the crude bio-ethanol obtained by SSF method was used. The feed rate was varied starting from 0.1 to 1 mL/min of bio-ethanol, with 133 mL/min Ar flow giving an GHSV of 7780 h−1 for 0.1 mL/min bio-ethanol, 27.050 h−1 for 0.6 mL/min ethanol and 42.480 h−1 for 1 mL/min bio-ethanol feeding rate, respectively. Ethanol being the main component of the crude bio-ethanol only its conversion was monitored in this stage of the study (Fig. 4 ). For bio-ethanol feed rate lower than 0.6 mL/min the ethanol conversion was 100%. By increasing further the feed flow, the ethanol conversion starts to decrease being approximately 94% for 1 mL/min bio-ethanol flow. This decrease of ethanol conversion may not be a significant decrease, but more important is the rapid deactivation of the Ni catalysts at this feeding rate. After only 3 h time on stream the catalyst retains only 90% of its original capacity to convert ethanol. This response of the whole system at high feed rates can be due to the “flooding” of the catalyst, in which the catalytic active sites are not able to convert the whole feedstock, leading to a decrease of conversion. Considering this influence of the feed rate upon the ethanol conversion, the liquid bio-ethanol feed rate, used for all further steam reforming experiments was established to 0.8 mL/min. The energetic efficiency of the hydrogen production process depends on the reforming temperature; lower temperatures lead to lower energy consumptions. Especially for hydrogen used as energy vector it is important to have production costs at least comparable, if not lower, than the cost of the energy obtained using hydrogen thus produced. The promotion of Ni/Al with rare earth oxides proved to have a beneficial effect on the efficiency of these catalysts for ethanol [15,16] and acetic acid [35,36] steam reforming. In the next section we report the effect of La2O3 and CeO2 addition to common Ni/Al catalyst used for crude bio-ethanol steam reforming. There are a series of differences between the reformation of ethanol or acetic acid solutions and the reformation of crude bio-ethanol produced according to the method described in this paper. These differences are: (i) the simultaneous presence of ethanol and significant amounts of acetic acid; (ii) the presence of lower amounts of a large number of other organic molecules (Table 1); (iii) the higher water–organic molecule ratios than those usually reported for reformation of ethanol and acetic acid solutions, due to the fact that we used the crude bio-ethanol solution as resulted from the fermentation. In order to study the influence of temperature on the catalytic steam reforming of bio-ethanol Ni and promoted Ni catalysts have been tested at temperatures between 150 and 350 °C. The gaseous products obtained in the steam reforming reaction for all three catalysts were: H2, CH4, CO and CO2. No significant concentration of other gaseous product was observed. The formation of very low concentrations of gases that are trapped in silica drying element cannot be, however, excluded. The collected liquid phase was also analyzed identifying un-reacted ethanol and acetic acid in more significant amounts, depending on their conversion at the specific reaction temperature, and also low concentrations of acetaldehyde and acetone. The rest of the crude bio-ethanol components were not recovered at the reactor outlet. This can be due to their reformation along with ethanol and acetic acid. The acetic acid conversion was also quantified besides the ethanol conversion, given the important amount of this component in crude bio-ethanol (Fig. 5 ). At 150 °C the conversions of both ethanol and acetic acid are low. With increasing temperature the conversion increases approaching 100% at 350 °C. A beneficial effect of the additional rare earth oxides is observed in ethanol conversion especially at lower temperatures. For Ni/La–Al important enhancements in ethanol conversion compared to Ni/Al is observed at 250 °C and even at 150 °C. For ceria promoted catalysts a significant increase of ethanol conversion is observed only at 250 °C. At this temperature the ethanol conversion on both promoted catalysts is very good approaching 90%. The acetic acid conversion instead is very low at 250 °C, being a major drawback for practical use of this reaction temperature in bio-ethanol steam reforming. For the conversion of acetic acid no significant beneficial effects of lanthana or ceria addition could be observed in our experimental conditions at any of the investigated temperature. It is important to notice, however, the lower temperature compared to previous studies at which acetic acid is fully converted [35,36]. This is due to high water excess which shifts the reaction equilibrium towards the formation of products. The beneficial effect observed for lanthana and ceria promoted catalysts is primarily due to the secondary oxide influence on the catalyst surface; these oxides behave as a metal dispersant in the Ni-alumina system. The direct consequence is the increase of the number of catalytic active sites which leads to the enhancement of reactants conversion [28,37]. As previously mentioned, the gaseous reaction products detected in significant concentrations are H2, CH4, CO and CO2, with H2 as the major product. With increasing temperature not only the conversion increases but also the ratio between the products changes. At 350 °C, at maximum conversion, the outlet gas composition, without carrier gas, for all the catalysts is given in Table 4 . The addition of the supplementary oxide to the support has an important effect on the product distribution by: (i) increasing the selectivity for hydrogen production in the detriment of methane formation, and (ii) favoring the transformation of CO in CO2 by favoring the water gas–shift reaction. At lower temperatures, both carbon oxides are present in the reaction products mixture for all catalysts, but at 350 °C no carbon monoxide was detected for catalysts promoted with additional oxide. Hydrogen production, expressed as volume of H2 produced per minute and per gram of catalyst, is a useful parameter which combines the catalyst activity for reactant conversion and the selectivity for H2 formation Fig. 6. It should be emphasized that hydrogen produced and analyzed in this study is obtained by reforming all the components contained by the crude bio-ethanol: ethanol, acetic acid and the other oxygenated organic molecules. At 250 °C the contribution of acetic acid to hydrogen production is low due to its low conversion on all catalysts. The improved hydrogen production obtained at this temperature for ceria and lanthana modified catalysts is explained by the improved ethanol conversion on these catalysts (Fig. 5a). At 350 °C, hydrogen production is enhanced over all catalysts due to the total conversion of acetic acid. On the promoted catalysts the production of hydrogen is also increased due to: (i) the increased ethanol conversion; (ii) the better selectivity for hydrogen formation; and (iii) the enhancement of water gas–shift reaction which also produce hydrogen. Among the two oxides, La2O3 seems to give better results for the production of hydrogen. It was reported also that the addition of rare earth oxides to alumina decreases the surface acidity, inhibiting thus some secondary reactions [18] and favoring the reformation reactions. The catalyst deactivation was expressed as the decrease of ethanol conversion in time. At 350 °C the catalysts are stable, little deactivation being observed for Ni/Al (conversion decreased from 96% to 93%) after 4 h time on stream. No deactivation appeared for the promoted catalysts, ethanol conversion being stable at 100%. However, a certain degree of deactivation occurs for all catalysts tested in bio-ethanol steam reforming at 150 °C and 250 °C, being more accentuated at 150 °C (Fig. 7 ). The main cause of catalysts' deactivation during steam reforming reactions is the formation and deposition of carbon on the catalytic active centers, as a result of secondary reactions [34,38]. Two methods were used to investigate the carbon deposition in bio-ethanol steam reforming experiments: TPO and XRD. The TPO results are presented in Fig. 8 . The quantity and structure of carbon deposited at 150 °C and 350 °C are very different. For all three catalysts used at 150 °C the main oxidation peak is situated in TPO spectra around 400 °C, corresponding to carbon in amorphous state, which usually does not deactivate the nickel catalysts [28]. In order to explain the catalysts deactivation, the XRD measurements were performed on used catalysts (Fig. 9 ). As expected, no peak attributed to graphitic carbon, situated at 26.5°, could be identified. The XRD results revealed instead a decrease in the intensity of the Ni diffraction lines and the presence of NiO. This indicates another and more probable cause of catalysts deactivation: the oxidation of catalytic active Ni species to the inactive NiO, which can be related to the combination of high water excess and low temperature used in these experiments. For Ni/Al catalyst used in steam reforming experiments at 350 °C, TPO measurements revealed two types of deposited carbon: lower quantity of amorphous carbon (oxidation temperature 435 °C) and high quantity of crystallized carbon with maximum oxidation peak situated at 700 °C. For lanthana and ceria promoted catalysts instead, very low quantity of deposited carbon was observed. In XRD spectra the formation of NiO was not observed (Fig. 9 b). The TPO and XRD results lead to the conclusion that the deactivation mechanism depends on the reaction temperature. At 150 °C the deactivation is mainly caused by NiO formation and the promotion of Ni catalysts with La2O3 and CeO2 has no significant effect on catalysts stability. At 350 °C the deactivation of Ni/Al is caused by deposition of crystallized carbon on catalytic centers and the promotion with La2O3 and CeO2 drastically decreases the carbon formation and improve the catalysts stability."
8,Conclusions,"Fir wood wastes were used to produce crude bio-ethanol by two methods: (i) simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and (ii) acid hydrolysis followed by the fermentation of acid hydrolyzate. The main components of the crude bio-ethanol are ethanol and acetic acid. In addition, low concentration of a wide range of alcohols, acids, esters, ethers and aldehydes were also determined. The concentration of all components depends on the hydrolysis method. In the SSF process the ethanol concentration is higher than in the acid hydrolysis: 43.69 g/L compared to 37.53 g/L. Important concentrations of acetic acid were determined in samples obtained by both methods. Opposed to ethanol concentration, the acetic acid concentration is higher in the acid hydrolysis process: 16.36 g/L compared to 10.24 g/L. The crude bio-ethanol was used to produce hydrogen by catalytic steam reforming. The tested catalysts were the common Ni/Al and two rare earth oxides promoted Ni catalysts: Ni/La–Al and Ni/Ce–Al prepared by successive wet impregnation. The characterization techniques revealed that the addition of rare earth oxides improves the Ni dispersion and the reducibility of the promoted catalysts. Crude bio-ethanol steam reforming experiments were performed using 1 g of catalyst, at atmospheric pressure, in the temperature range of 150–350 °C, with different bio-ethanol feed rates, and Ar as carrier gas. The best feed rate which ensures the optimal ratio between conversion and catalytic deactivation was established at 0.8 mL/min bio-ethanol. The addition of rare earth oxides (La2O3 and CeO2) to the alumina support improves the ethanol conversion especially at 250 °C, but no significant effect on acetic acid conversion was observed at any studied temperature. At 250 °C the ethanol conversion is almost 90% for Ni/La–Al and Ni/Ce–Al, but the acetic acid conversion is below 30% for all catalysts. The optimum working temperature, at which both ethanol and acetic acid presents maximum conversion is 350 °C. At this temperature the best hydrogen production is obtained for Ni/La–Al due to better ethanol conversion and better selectivity for hydrogen formation. At 350 °C the promoted catalysts are stable for 4 h time on stream, while Ni/Al suffers deactivation due to graphitic carbon deposition. Higher degrees of deactivation are obtained at lower temperatures, mainly caused by Ni oxidation to NiO."
