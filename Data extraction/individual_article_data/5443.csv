0,Introduction,"Biofuel production through energy-efficient processes has become a major priority for sustainable development of renewable energy sources considering current fossil fuel consumption and resource depletion issues. Among the potential renewable biofuel sources, biodiesel is a more promising fuel since it can be produced in liquid form suitable for use as a transportation fuel. Biodiesel refers to the production of mono alkyl esters by a chemical process called transesterification, which is the reaction of oil (fatty acids) with a monohydric alcohol [1]. Commonly used alcohols are ethanol and methanol which result in production of fatty acids ethyl esters (FAEEs) and fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) respectively, i.e., biodiesel through transesterification reaction. Various lipid and oil sources categorized as first generation (e.g., vegetable and edible oils), second generation (e.g., used oils, animal fats and other non-edible crop oils) and third generation (e.g., microbial and algae derived lipids and oils) feedstock have been studied as potential raw materials for biodiesel production [2]. While transesterification reaction is simple and efficient, the process condition severities by conventional methods reduce the net energy benefit from this conversion reaction [3,41]. Process intensification using novel equipment or methods (process schemes and techniques) could help these processes become energy-efficient [42]. Process intensification refers to development of novel equipment and/or methods that produce significantly higher yields or superior benefits in comparison with the existing equipment and/or methods in practice. These benefits can be realized in the form of dramatic reduction in processing times, significant improvements in product quality or quantity and decreasing the equipment size, reducing complexity of the production schemes, improving energy efficiency, minimizing waste production, and finally resulting in cheaper and sustainable technologies [4]. The process intensification developments in equipment could focus on developing novel reactor design with intense mixing to promote heat- and mass-transfer while developments in methods could focus on integrating the reaction-separation processes (minimizing process steps), use of alternative energy sources, and new process control techniques. In the context of biodiesel production, process intensification efforts refer to increasing mass and heat transfer rates among the reaction products whether in extraction and/or transesterification and/or separation and/or purification stages. Several methods to enhance the biodiesel production reactions were reported. The most notable results were obtained when microwave or ultrasound energy sources were employed as process intensification methods [5]. These two novel methods have distinct features in that microwaves are a result of electromagnetic irradiation while the ultrasound is based on high frequency acoustic waves [6,7]. Many studies involving these two process intensification methods have reported higher biodiesel reaction yields, superior biodiesel quality and reduced chemical, energy consumption, and reaction times [8]. Although these results are impressive, both microwave and ultrasound have their own drawbacks. For example, microwaves have mass transfer limitations and ultrasound does not possess the ability to generate high thermal energy for chemical synthesis [9]. Therefore, a combination of both techniques [9–11] may result in a complementary effect that could provide energy efficient biodiesel production. Ultrasonication will provide the mechanical mixing effect required by microwaves to improve mass and heat transfer, and microwaves will generate thermal energy that ultrasound lacks; thereby, intensifying the process and maximizing the benefits. The combination of microwave with ultrasound technique can improve the process chemistry by increasing the yields, and by reducing the process time by 10–15 folds as compared to the individual operation [12,13]. While many studies reported on the individual process intensification effects of microwaves or ultrasound on transesterification reaction, very few recent studies reported on the combined effect of these two novel methods on biodiesel production through transesterification reaction [9,14]. Moreover, the effect of reactants, i.e., the alcohol and the combined effect of these two novel methods has not been reported to date. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of alcohols, methanol and ethanol, under simultaneous microwave and ultrasound irradiations. The effect of alcohol to oil ratios, catalyst amounts, and reaction times were studied through process parametric evaluation studies. Finally, the effect of ultrasound and microwave power densities was investigated. A comparison of the methanol and ethanol based transesterification reaction under simultaneous microwave and ultrasound conditions were presented."
1,Ethanol and methanol in biofuel production,"1.1 Ethanol and methanol in biofuel production Ethanol and methanol can be used directly without requiring major changes in the structure of a car engine, and both alcohols are known as the most suitable fuels for spark ignited engines [15]. Ethanol has been used as a fuel, and it is usually blended with gasoline to reduce emissions. According to the Energy Information Administration, nearly all gasoline sold in the U.S. contains some ethanol. One of the drawbacks of ethanol production is the use of edible corn or other sugars; therefore, several studies report on the production of bioethanol from cellulosic material to be used as a biofuel source [16–18]. Also, ethanol has been proven to be efficient in enhancing biodiesel production; however, its major disadvantage when compared to methanol is its cost. During the first two months of 2015, the price of ethanol has been $1.44 per gallon [19] while for methanol, the reported price was $1.25 per gallon [20]. However, regardless of their prices, both alcohols are being used in great quantities either for biodiesel production or for blending with gasoline. Major part of the United States is proposing to change from E10 (10% ethanol) to E15 [21] while China has already set standards for M85 (85% methanol), and they have been using M15 for several years [22]. Both ethanol and methanol have advantages and disadvantages; methanol is more cost-effective than ethanol, but ethanol has better environmental acceptance. Nevertheless, both alcohols are capable of producing high quality biodiesel."
2,Effects of microwave and ultrasound irradiations,"1.2 Effects of microwave and ultrasound irradiations Microwaves interact with alcohol by dipole rotation, and alcohols, such as ethanol and methanol are pure polar reactants whose molecules are hydrogen bonded in the liquid state. Therefore, the heat transfer limitations during the transesterification process are overcome due to the swift dipolar moment of polar molecules [23–25]. On the other hand, ultrasound efficiency could be attributed to proper mass and heat transfer provided by the physical and chemical effects during intensification reaction caused by turbulence in the reaction medium and free radicals [26]. Ultrasound efficacy depends on the local temperature, pressure effect, and better emulsification characteristics due to the cavitational events generated locally in the reactor [27]. Methanol and ethanol are strong mediums in absorbing microwaves, and thus the excess of alcohol may absorb microwave energy and reduce the microwave power. The medium absorbing capabilities of a reactant are determined by its loss factor (tan δ), which is obtained from the division of the dielectric loss (ε″) by the dielectric constant (ε') [28]. The loss factor for methanol and ethanol is 0.659 and 0.941 respectively at 2.45GHz [28]. The higher the loss factor of a solvent, the quicker is its absorption capability, which indicates that ethanol is more efficient in converting microwave energy into thermal heat. Furthermore, the auto ignition temperature for methanol (385°C) is only 20°C higher than that of ethanol (365°C); however, the auto ignition of methyl esters (464°C) is 131°C higher than ethyl esters (333°C), but both are higher than regular diesel (315°C) [29]."
3,Materials and methods,
4,Materials,"2.1 Materials The waste oil was collected from the Mississippi State University cafeteria. The acid value of the waste cooking oil was low suitable for base catalyzed transesterification reaction. The calculated molecular weight for the waste cooking oil was 842.58g/mol, which was obtained through gas chromatograph flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Ethanol, methanol, and catalyst (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) were purchased from Fisher Scientific and are of analytical grade. The transesterification experiments were conducted in a microwave/ultrasound reactor with temperature and power control functions manufactured by Columbia International Technologies®, USA. Microwave-transparent, three-neck custom-fabricated reaction vessels made of borosilicate glass (provided by Columbia International Technologies) were used as reaction vessels."
5,Methods,"2.2 Methods The experimental unit combines microwave generator and an ultrasound horn in a single facilitating simultaneous application of both irradiations with inclusion of a thermocouple and a reflux condenser as described previously [9]. A set of conditions were selected to test the effect of microwave and ultrasound irradiations (MW/US) from our previous experience. A sample volume of 20mL of waste vegetable oil (WVO) and the power output of MW/US (100/100W) were fixed for the process parametric evaluation studies, i.e., while varying catalyst loads from 0.25 to 1.25% (wt./wt.) by increments of 0.25%; the molar ratio of methanol or ethanol to oil tested were, 4.5:1, 6:1, 9:1, and 12:1; and the reaction times ranging from 1 to 4min at one minute interval. The three-neck reactor vessel was equipped with a reflux condenser and a temperature probe. The reflux condenser allowed cooling down the evaporating reactant and keeping it in the mixture. Waste vegetable oil was added to the homogeneous mixture of the catalyst and the reactant (ethanol or methanol). The mixture was then exposed to the combination of microwave and ultrasound irradiations. Following the irradiation exposure, the samples were allowed to settle overnight and later washed with lukewarm deionized water in a pear-shaped separatory funnel to eliminate the soap and un-reacted ethanol or methanol (if any) in the biodiesel layer. Prior to washing, the glycerol layer was removed from the biodiesel layer with a pipette. After washing, the samples were placed in an oven at 60°C before measuring the yield. The biodiesel yield was determined by measuring the amount of biodiesel obtained divided by the initial amount of waste vegetable oil. The biodiesel quality was confirmed by using a GC-FID. The analysis was carried out on a Varian Gas Chromatograp hy (GC) with cool on column injection and FID detection as required by ASTM 6584 method for B100. The operating scheme of the biodiesel analysis using the Gas Chromatography is discussed in our previous work [7]. All of the tested conditions were run in triplicates to verify data accuracy and reproducibility. The statistical analysis of the data was done to obtain the standard error and standard deviation for each sample. The average of three test results with standard error bars were presented for each of the process parameters. For the microwave and ultrasound individual and synergistic effect tests, the power output rate of 100/100W, 2min reaction time, 1% catalyst, and 6:1 methanol or ethanol to oil molar ratio were fixed during the experiment. For the power density tests, different sample volumes (20, 40, 60, and 80mL) were evaluated using a 6:1 methanol or ethanol to oil ratio, reaction time of 2min, and catalyst of 0.75wt.% for 100/100, 200/0, and 0/200W of MW/US power output rates. Various conditions were evaluated for the synergistic effect and power combination (microwave and ultrasound irradiation) studies."
6,Results and discussion,"This section will first describe the process parametric evaluation and a comparison of the transesterification of used oil under simultaneous microwave and ultrasound irradiations using ethanol and methanol reactants. Following this, the evaluation of synergistic effect of microwave and ultrasound irradiations using ethanol or methanol will be discussed. Finally, the effect of power densities on the biodiesel yield from transesterification reaction will be discussed."
7,Simultaneous microwave and ultrasound effect on alcohol,"3.1 Simultaneous microwave and ultrasound effect on alcohol Fig. 1 a and b shows the temperature profiles for the transesterification reaction using methanol and ethanol at different molar ratios (4.5:1, 6:1, 9:1, and 12:1) respectively for two minutes of reaction time. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the reaction medium temperatures start to rise slowly after 30s. This lag in the temperature rise is due to the delay in release of microwave energy. This also means that there is less energy consumption in this reaction. The reaction temperatures for reactions involving ethanol as a reactant were lower due to higher molecular mass of ethanol. The biodiesel yields (FAMEs or FAEEs) for different reactant to oil ratios are shown in Fig. 1c. Both alcohols resulted in a biodiesel yield of 90% or higher except for ethanol to oil ratio of 12:1 with about 89% yield. The biodiesel yields at a molar ratio of 12:1 were lower since the constraints of reversible reaction limit the effect of excess alcohol after the optimum molar ratio is achieved [30]. About 9:1 alcohol to oil ratio was found to be optimum for high biodiesel yields. It was observed that the FAMEs yields were slightly higher than FAEEs yields. This was noticeable after washing the samples with deionized water because there was more soap present from using sodium ethoxide than that from using sodium methoxide, therefore, reducing the biodiesel yield. The presence of NaOH as catalyst had a significant impact on the biodiesel yields. The temperature profiles for catalyst effect are shown in Fig. 2 a and b. The biodiesel yields could be improved by addition of appropriate amount of catalyst. However, it was found that higher amounts of catalyst do not necessarily have a positive impact on biodiesel yields; perhaps, higher concentrations of catalysts interfere with the biodiesel yield and quality. The effect of catalyst was found to be greater when methanol was used as an alcohol. The maximum biodiesel yields were obtained at a catalyst addition of 0.75% by wt. which was 97.6% and 96.5% for methanol and ethanol respectively (Fig. 2c). It was noticed that saponification was predominant when using ethanol as a reactant, and it was confirmed when higher catalyst amount was used with ethanol, the reaction mixture started to solidify. This resulted in significant biodiesel losses in further washing and cleaning cycles. The biodiesel yields at 1wt.% NaOH were 90.2% for ethanol and 96.5% for methanol respectively, while at 1.25wt.% catalyst the yields were 88.6% and 91% for ethanol and methanol respectively. This agrees that there is more soap formed when ethanol was used as an alcohol. According to Bautista et al. [31], when a higher amount of a basic catalyst is used, the amount of soap also increases and it dissolves in the glycerol layer due to their polarity resulting in lower biodiesel yields. Adequate exposure of the reaction mixture to the microwaves and ultrasound is necessary for higher product yields. Since microwaves and ultrasound reportedly produce superior results in very short periods of exposure, four different reaction times between 1 and 4min with one minute interval were evaluated (Fig. 3 ). The reaction temperatures increased with the reaction time or microwave/ultrasound exposure time. The biodiesel yields exhibited similar trends for both reactants. However, FAMEs yields were higher than FAEE yields. At one minute reaction time, the FAMEs and FAEEs yields were 89.3% and 88% respectively. While at two minutes reaction time, the FAMEs and FAEEs yields were 96.5% and 90.2% respectively. These yields were close to the FAMEs yields obtained by Thanh et al. [32] at 5:1 methanol to oil molar ratio 0.7wt.% KOH catalyst, and 50min reaction time by using ultrasonication. But, the results of these study are higher than the 90% yield with 12:1 methyl acetate to oil ratio, 1% potassium methoxide catalyst obtained by Maddikeri et al. [33] using sonochemical reactors (Fig. 3). The biodiesel yield was significantly reduced when the mixture was exposed to longer reaction time. Lower biodiesel yields resulted from 4min reaction time, which are the result of the side degradation reactions and losses of unsaturated FAMEs or FAEEs that appear at high reaction times reducing biodiesel yields [34–36]. One noteworthy observation in these reactions is that the reaction mixture temperatures have significantly increased with reaction time. Methanol and ethanol are generally good microwave energy absorbers due to their polarity. When ethanol was used as a reactant, the biodiesel yields were higher under ultrasound irradiation due to higher solubility properties of ethanol. For this reason, combining both alcohols could result in improved biodiesel yield and quality [37]. These reactants can behave differently at elevated temperatures because most reactants become less polar with increased reaction temperature. For example, at elevated temperatures the bond angle in water widens and its dielectric properties approach those of organic solvents. The reaction temperature for methanol reactions reached as high as 78.6°C while for ethanol reactions reached 95°C. These reaction temperatures are significantly higher than the near boiling temperatures required for enhanced transesterification reactions. Higher reaction temperatures usually result in undesired product formation and reactants losses. Therefore, a reaction time of 2min appears to be adequate for completion of transesterification reaction with suitable reaction temperatures."
8,Synergistic effect of microwaves and ultrasound,"3.2 Synergistic effect of microwaves and ultrasound The synergistic effect of simultaneous microwave and ultrasound irradiations on different power combinations was evaluated. A total of 300W of electrical energy was applied in different portions of microwave and ultrasound irradiations and combinations as 100/200, 200/100, 150/150, and 250W/50W MW/US (Fig. 4 ). Interestingly, for some of the conditions higher biodiesel yields were obtained when using ethanol as the alcohol, which means that higher power output is required to enhance the transesterification using ethanol. This can be attributed to the fact that ethanol has a higher boiling point (78.4°C) than methanol (64.7°C), and it requires longer reaction times and higher power output. Also, better microwave absorption properties as well as the solubility properties of ethanol could enhance the mass and heat transfer efficiency in the transesterification reaction. The highest biodiesel yield was 96% using ethanol when the power output of 250W for MW and 50W for US. Similarly, 95.5% biodiesel yield was obtained when the power output was set to 150W for both MW and US."
9,Effect of power density,"3.3 Effect of power density As previously discussed, the highest biodiesel yield for different catalyst was 0.75wt.% at 2min reaction time, 100W/100W power output, and a reactant to oil ratio of 9:1. Therefore, these conditions were set to test different oil volumes (20, 40, 60, and 80mL) for 100W/100W, 200W/0W, and 0/200W MW/US (Fig. 5 ). As expected, the results were much higher for both reactants when using the combined effect of MW and US than when they were exposed to microwave or ultrasound individually. For example, a biodiesel yield of 97.6% was achieved when using methanol, 20mL of oil, and the combined effect of 100/100W. This result is much higher than the 87.1% and 89% for MW and US, respectively for the same conditions. Similarly, the results favored the MW and US combination over the individual effect of these two technologies when using ethanol, which support the hypothesis of this article. For each volume condition previously mentioned, the power density was evaluated. The power effect can be calculated as the ratio of power supplied to the total amount of the sample mixture, which help to optimize the approximate power output for a desired reaction [9]. The power densities using ethanol are shown in Fig. 6 and were calculated as 3.5, 4.7, 7.1, and 14.1W/mL for samples volumes of 80, 60, 40, and 20mL. For the previously mentioned sample volumes, the power densities for methanol are 3.8, 5.1, 7.6, and 15.3W/mL. Power densities were higher for methanol because the molecular weight of methanol is smaller than the one of ethanol, therefore, less methanol volume is required to meet the 9:1 alcohol to oil ratio. It is interesting to note for both the reactants that higher power densities did not result in higher biodiesel yields. The biodiesel yields were higher at a lower power density effect but the yield enhancement decreases as the power density decreases below the optimum power density. This test is critical to determine the power utilization efficiency by the reaction mixture. Power density effect also reveals that higher power densities do not necessarily enhance the product yield rather result in lower yields due to enhanced mixing and heating. An optimum power density determination for this reaction is also expected to provide the lowest specific energy consumption."
10,Biodiesel composition,"3.4 Biodiesel composition FAME and FAEE analysis for biodiesel from waste vegetable oil have resulted in the following major compounds: Palmitic (C16:0); Palmitoleic (C16:1); Linoleic (C18:2); Linolenic (C18:3); Archidic (C20:0); Behenic (C22:0); Erucic (C22:1); and Lignoceric (C24:0) for MW/US using methanol and ethanol; however, Octanic (C8:0); Lauric (C12:0); and Myristic (C14:0) were observed when using ethanol only. The results show that fatty acids ethyl esters (FAEE) have more saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) compounds (Fig. 7 ) than fatty acids methyl esters (FAME), which means that the cetane number for FAEE is slightly higher [1,38,39], and therefore, the ignition quality is higher. However, there are some advantages as well as disadvantages when the presence of saturated fatty acids is predominant. Saturated fatty acids have a higher melting point, and they may melt at room temperature. FAMEs on the other hand, have higher quantity of unsaturated fatty acids which can also result in an increase of NOx emissions, lower cetane number, higher oxidation chances, and lower stability [40]. In order to use highly unsaturated-fat-biodiesel as fuel, an oxidative stabilizer may be required. But, the biodiesel containing high amount of unsaturated fat has a lower gel point which makes it suitable for cold weather."
11,Conclusion,"This study evaluated the effect of the type of alcohol on the transesterification reaction of used vegetable oil to produce biodiesel. Several process parametric evaluation studies showed that under simultaneous microwave and ultrasound irradiations as energy source for the transesterification reaction, similar biodiesel yields were obtained for the two different reactants. When microwaves or ultrasound was applied individually, the biodiesel yields were higher for ethanol which could be attributed to its better characteristics for microwave energy absorption and better solubility properties under ultrasound exposure compared with methanol. The present study reported batch operation of the transesterification at a laboratory scale. Further studies will be critical in developing continuous flow and higher capacity system for microwave and ultrasound enhanced biodiesel production. This may result in an energy-efficient and chemical-saving method for biodiesel production."
