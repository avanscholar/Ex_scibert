0,Introduction,"The ability to process and extend carbon functionalities by carbon–carbon (CC) bond forming reactions is of paramount importance to the synthetic organic chemistry, such as medicinal chemistry, agrochemical and natural product synthesis [1]. In this context, aldehydes and ketones play a pivotal role since their carbonyl functionality can be involved in an array of reactions leading to CC bond formation, such as the attack by a variety of carbon-based nucleophiles like organometallic reagents (organolithium, Grignard, etc.), cyanides, enolates derived from active methylene compounds, etc., and olefination by Wittig-type reagents [2]. Moreover, these compounds can also act as C-nucleophiles via the corresponding enols, such as in aldol reactions. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using alcohols as starting material for CC bond formation processes, because they are cheap, easy to handle and store, environmentally friendly and renewable alternative to petroleum-based compounds. Primary and secondary alcohols can be converted into the related aldehydes and ketones, respectively, by using a wide range of oxidizing reagents [3]. However, these transformations suffer of waste problems due to the large amount of coproducts formed by the reagents, thus decreasing the atom efficiency. Therefore, the search of efficient, selective, atom-economical and environmentally benign methods [4] continues to be a pivotal challenge for chemists. Metal-catalysed alcohol dehydrogenation, through the direct abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate, is a straightforward route to obtain carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, without the need of oxidizing agents [5]. Interestingly, if the dehydrogenation catalyst is not only able to remove the hydrogen from an alcohol substrate to provide an aldehyde or ketone intermediate, but also to keep temporarily the taken off hydrogen, and next return it to the unsaturated product formed by reaction of the intermediate carbonyl compound with a carbon-nucleophile, a new CC bond is formed in an overall redox neutral process known as borrowing hydrogen (BH) or hydrogen autotransfer (HA) catalysis (Scheme 1 , left) [6]. In this way the BH process provides formal products of alcohol substitution by using pre-metallated carbon nucleophiles through pathways involving dehydrogenation, condensation and final reduction with product formation and catalyst regeneration. Another approach to CC bond formation, conceptually related to the BH method, is the alcohol-unsaturate transfer hydrogenative CC coupling (Krische’s chemistry), which affords formal products of alcohol CH functionalization (Scheme 1, right) [7]. This redox neutral process allows the stepwise reintroduction of the H2 removed from the alcohol by the catalysts into the final product through pathways involving alcohol dehydrogenation, hydrometalation of a π-unsaturated reactant, carbonyl addition and final product formation with catalyst regeneration. In the BH process there is no hydrogen loss and then no further hydrogen source is necessary. Moreover, this approach does not require additional steps for the substrate activation and the total process occurs in a one-pot fashion. Thus, the BH methodology compared to traditional methods offers several advantages, in addition to the purely chemical, as those economic and environmental. A variety of transition-metal complexes (Ir, Rh, Ru, Pd, Cu, Os, etc.) have been developed for homo- and heterogeneous BH catalysis, and a number of general reviews describing aspects of BH chemistry are available [6,7]. This report focuses its interest only on the application of ruthenium and osmium complexes [8] in the two main types of CC bond-forming reactions by BH catalysis, outlining the considerable progress made over the years using these metal-complexes in the α-alkylation of ketones, β-alkylation of secondary alcohols, C-alkylation of relatively inactivated substrates bearing fewer acidic α-hydrogens (acetonitriles, acetamides, esters, etc.) with alcohols, and in the formation of other CC bonds using alcohols as substrates (or reactants). The results obtained in the ruthenium- and osmium-catalysed alcohol-unsaturate transfer hydrogenative CC coupling are also briefly presented. Mechanistic aspects related to these reactions are discussed."
1,α-Alkylation of ketones with alcohols,
2,α-Alkylation of ketones with alcohols to afford ketones,"2.1 α-Alkylation of ketones with alcohols to afford ketones The α-alkylation of ketones is a key reaction for the construction of CC bonds. In the most common protocols, ketones are converted into metal enolates [9] or enamines [10], which by treatment with carbon electrophiles, such as alkyl halides, give α-alkylated ketones. However, the formation of stoichiometric amount of salt waste has prompted the search for more green and atom-economical alternative processes. Interestingly, the α-alkylation of ketones has been improved in recent years by using transition-metal-catalysed reactions, which use alcohols as latent aldehydes under BH conditions [6,11]. In this context, the first example of a homogeneous metal-catalysed α-alkylation of ketones with alcohols was reported in a French patent in 1969 [12]. In that occasion the use of 0.2mol% Ru(acac)3 as catalyst and 15mol% NaOH as base in an autoclave allowed to convert various ketones (acetone, acetophenone and 2-butanone) into the related α-alkylated ketones by reaction with primary alcohols in 29–93% yields (Scheme 2 ). The general simplified pathway involves the dehydrogenation of the alcohol 1 to the aldehyde 2 by the ruthenium complex ([Ru]), followed by cross aldol reaction of the formed aldehyde with the ketone 3, generating the α,β-unsaturated ketone 4 (Scheme 3 ). This intermediate is then hydrogenated to the saturated ketone 5 and/or the alcohol 6 by the dihydridoruthenium species ([Ru]H2) formed in the initial oxidation step. Experiments aimed to determine the species formed in the catalytic cycle suggested that the olefinic double bond of 4 is first reduced to form 5, whose carbonyl group is in turn reduced to 6 by [Ru]H2 formed by oxidation of another equivalent of the starting alcohol 1. Thus, two equivalents of 1 with respect to 3 are required to obtain one equivalent of the final product 6 [13]. Cho and co-workers, taking into account that in the RuCl2(PPh3)3 catalysed the α-alkylation of ketones 3 with primary alcohols 1, alcohol products 6 were preferentially formed when an alcohol excess is used with respect to the ketone (1/3 =3) [13], evaluated the possibility to favour the formation of the ketone products 5. This goal was pursued by reducing the molar ratio alcohol/ketone to 1/1 and by adding a hydrogen acceptor, which by trapping the dihydridoruthenium species should avoid the further hydrogenation of alkylated ketones 5 to alcohols 6 (Scheme 3). After a number of experiments the addition of one equivalent of 1-dodecene to RuCl2(PPh3)3 (2mol%) catalysed the reaction of acetophenone with benzyl alcohol (1:1M ratio) at 80°C, affording the expected ketone product, 1,3-diphenylpropanone, in 82% yield [14]. Given these conditions, the reaction of several ketones with primary alcohols afforded α-alkylation products in 48–86% yields with a low amount of further reduced secondary alcohols (Scheme 4 ). Yus and co-workers demonstrated that among a number of transition metallic salts, iridium and ruthenium complexes used in the reaction of acetophenone with benzyl alcohol in 1/1 ratio and without the use of an hydrogen acceptor, RuCl2(DMSO)4 and [IrCl(COD)]2 gave the best results, with the former showing a slightly better atom efficiency (Scheme 5 ) [15,16]. Then, other reaction parameters such as base (KOH, CsOH, NEt3, none), solvent (1,4-dioxane, THF, water, MeCN, DMF, CH2Cl2), extra ligand (pyridinedicarboxylic acid) and temperature were examined, showing a maximum by using 2mol% RuCl2(DMSO)4, 100mol% KOH, dioxane, 80°C for 24h. Under these reaction conditions the α-alkylation of a number of methyl ketones with alcohols was pursued (Scheme 6 ). The reaction gave excellent results with aryl methyl ketones and aromatic alcohols (55–96%), decreased noteworthy with heteroaromatic alcohols (20–25%) and failed with aliphatic or propargyl alcohols. When acetophenone was coupled with cinnamyl alcohol, only the related saturated ketone 1,5-diphenylpentanone, formed by hydrogenation of the expected δ,ε-unsaturated ketone product, was isolated in 48% yield. The reaction was also extended to heteroaromatic methyl ketones that provided products depending on the nature of the heteroaromatic system (0–45%). The reaction with ketones different from methyl derivatives failed to give the α-alkylated product [15]. On the other hand, reaction of α-tetralone with 4-methoxy benzyl alcohol afforded the unsaturated ketone as the only isolated product in 35% yield, while purely aliphatic bicyclic ketones gave the corresponding α,β-unsaturated ketones with good to excellent yields (Scheme 7 ). A study carried out with different combinations of labeled reagents afforded a number of useful information, which drove the authors to suggest the mechanism pathway showed in Scheme 8 . The main point in this mechanism is that probably an active catalytic species, [Ru-OH], is formed by transformation of the starting Ru-complex; then, [Ru-OH] reacts with the primary alkoxide to give the related mono- or dihydride ruthenium catalytic active species [Ru-H]. The fact that a stoichiometric amount of base is required so that the reaction proceeds seems to indicate that its role is to generate not only the enolate from the ketone, but also the alkoxide that by interaction with the [Ru-OH] active species gives the related aldehyde and a new ruthenium hydride species [Ru-H]. Finally, the reduction of the double bond of the α,β-unsaturated ketone was assumed to proceed via a Michael-type addition of the Ru-hydride to produce the related Ru-enolate, which is hydrolyzed by water to generate the final ketone and the [Ru-OH] active species Ryu and co-workers have recently found that the α-alkylation of ketones with primary alcohols can be efficiently obtained by using RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 as the catalyst [17]. The reaction of acetophenone with 4-methylbenzyl alcohol was examined in the presence of 1,10-phenthroline and different bases (K2CO3, Na2CO3, NEt3 and Cs2CO3) in toluene at 140°C. Under the best reaction conditions (RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 (1mol%), Cs2CO3 (150mol%), toluene, 140°C, 20h) the product 1-phenyl-3-(p-tolyl)propanone was obtained in 86% yield. The generality of the reaction was next examined, showing that good yields (55–92%) were obtained in the α-alkylation of a variety of ketones with (hetero)aryl carbinols, whereas with non-benzylic primary alcohols were obtained poor results (R1 =Ph, R2 =pentyl, 22% yield) that, interestingly, could be dramatically increased by a catalytic amount (3–6mol%) of 1,10-phenanthroline (R1 =Ph, R2 =pentyl, i-PrCH2, s-butyl and cyclohexyl: 72–88% yields) (Scheme 9 ). Zhang and co-workers exploited the BH methodology to develop a suitable catalyst system to provide α-pyridinyl methylated ketones from readily available ketones and pyridinyl methanols [18]. The nine Ru-complexes 7–15 (1mol%) (Fig. 1 ) were assessed as catalysts in the presence of KOt-Bu in tert-amyl alcohol at 120°C for the α-alkylation of acetophenone with 3-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine (20a) (Fig. 2 ) to generate 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-phenylpropan-1-one (22a). Among these precursors the complex [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 (14) showed the best activity, affording 22a in 76% yield. The interaction of 14 with the four diphosphine ligands 16–19 (Fig. 1) increased the yield, which reached 92% by combining with Xantphos (16) in a 1:2 ratio. Also a variety of pyridinyl carbinols and aryl methyl ketones gave moderate to excellent yields of the expected products, with the exception of acetophenone (21f) containing the strong electron-withdrawing NO2 group (Scheme 10 and Fig. 2). The reaction was also unsuccessful with the sec-pyridinyl alcohol 1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethanol (20e). Baratta and co-workers have recently reported the first example of an osmium complex in BH catalysis [19]. The osmium complex 23 and the related ruthenium complex 24 (Scheme 11 ), both incorporating the ligand 2-aminomethylpyridine, catalysed efficiently an array of organic transformations involving ketones and alcohols [8b], including the α-alkylation of α-tetralone with primary aliphatic alcohols. At 120°C and in the presence of KOt-Bu in t-BuOH/toluene high conversions of α-tetralone into the corresponding α-alkylated products were obtained in short reaction times with quite low loading (0.5mol%) of both complexes (Scheme 12 ). Interestingly, Os-23 displayed a higher activity compared to Ru-24, effecting the alkylation of α-tetralone with EtOH, n-PrOH, and n-BuOH in 1h, 30min, and 10min, respectively. More recently, another Os-complex promoted efficiently the α-alkylation of methyl ketones (Scheme 13 ) and aryl acetonitriles with alcohols (Scheme 57) [20]. Thus, the alkylation of acetophenone with benzyl alcohol, performed in the presence of 1mol% [Os(η6-p-cymene)(OH)IPr]OTf (25) (i-Pr=1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolylidene) (Fig. 3 ) and 20mol% KOH in refluxing toluene, afforded 1,3-diphenylpropanone in 99% yield after only 1.5h (Scheme 13). The reaction was carried out so as to remove azeotropically the generated H2O, because the complex 25 was also a very efficient catalyst for the hydration of nitriles to amides [21]. Under these conditions, other 5 ketones produced the related homologated ketones in high yields within few hours (2.25–4h) (Scheme 13). The examples described above are mostly limited to the α-alkylation by of methyl ketones with alcohols to give linear ketones. In fact, there are only two successful cases of Ru-catalysed α-alkylation of methylene ketones to give α-branched products: (i) the α-alkylation of aryl-alkyl ketones, including cyclic, with pyridinyl methanol derivatives by a Ru-bisphosphine system [18] (Scheme 10) and (ii) the α-alkylation of α-tetralone with primary aliphatic alcohols by a Ru-2-aminomethylpyridine based catalyst [19b] (Scheme 12). Very recently, the catalyst Ru(NHC)2 formed by combining [Ru(cod)(2-methylallyl)2] with the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) 26·HBF4 (Fig. 4 ) in a 1:2molar ratio was very efficient in the α-alkylation of methylene ketones with an array of primary alcohols [20]. After extensive optimization the alkylation of 1,3-diphenylpropanone (1equiv) with benzyl alcohol (1.05equiv), Ru(NHC)2 (2mol%), LiOt-Bu (2equiv) in t-AmOH/n-hexane at 100°C for 24h, gave 1,2,3-triphenylpropanone in 96% yield with low amounts of secondary alcohols as side products. The substrate scope was then examined under these conditions by the α-alkylation of various methylene ketones with benzyl alcohol (Scheme 14 ) and primary alcohols (Scheme 15 ). In both cases moderate to high yields were obtained. Interestingly, this approach was successful to obtain the blockbuster drug donepezil in 40% yield (Scheme 15). This protocol was also efficient in the one-pot double alkylation of aryl-methyl ketones derivatives by sequential addition of two different primary alcohols (Scheme 16 ). An experiment was carried out to determine if Ru(NHC)2 is able not only to catalyse the BH steps but also to influence the aldol condensation step. Thus, 1.3-diphenylpropanone was reacted with benzaldehyde under the usual reaction conditions in the absence or presence of Ru(NHC)2, and under conditions established for Fe (Knölker’s complex) [23], Ir [24] and Rh [25] catalysts in BH reactions. The comparative results in Scheme 17 indicate that while Ru(NHC)2 greatly influences the CC forming condensation, the other complexes gave similar results to the blank reaction."
3,α-Alkylation of ketones with alcohols to afford alcohols,"2.2 α-Alkylation of ketones with alcohols to afford alcohols The coupling of ketones 2 with a primary alcohols 1 favours the formation of the coupled ketones 5 (α-alkylation of 2 with 1) or secondary alcohols 6, deriving from reduction of the ketones 5 in the last step (Scheme 3), according to the reaction conditions, such as catalyst, molar ratio of ketones/alcohol, solvent and additives. Cho and co-workers developed a Ru-catalysed process to obtain secondary alcohols by reaction of ketones with primary alcohols [14]. A number of Ru-complexes were assessed to catalyse the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone with n-butanol (Scheme 18 ). The best result in terms of both overall yield and relative amount of 1-phenylhexanone to 1-phenylhexanol was accomplished by RuCl2(PPh3)3 (0.5mol%) with a ratio ketone/alcohol=1/3 and KOH (300mol%) in 1,4-dioxane at 80°C. This screening appears to indicate that (i) the increase of the molar ratio primary alcohol/ketone gives rise to the preferential formation of the secondary alcohol to α-alkylated ketone, and (ii) to account for the odd statistical result for hydrogen between reactants and products, dioxane is the source of the hydrogen required to form the product at the alcohol oxidation level [26]. Under these reaction conditions a series of ketones and primary alcohols afforded the secondary alcohol products in moderate to good yields (43–80%) (Scheme 19 ). When α-tetralone was reacted with n-propanol, 2-butyl-1-tetralone was also isolated in 45% yield. The same research group, starting from the consideration that the use of ethylenediamine considerably improves the Ru-catalysed transfer hydrogenation from 2-propanol [27], examined the reaction of ketones with primary alcohols in the presence of the RuCl2(PPh3)3/ethylenediamine/KOH/dioxane system at 80°C [28]. This screening demonstrated that the amount of ethylenediamine added to the reaction mixture affects remarkably the product selectivity, indicating that this compound appears to act not only as a ligand of the Ru-catalyst but also as a hydrogen donor. The best results in terms of both overall yield and selectivity of secondary alcohols to α-alkylated ketones were achieved by using a 1:2molar ratio alcohol/ketone and a slight excess (20%) of ethylenediamine. Under optimized conditions a series of primary alcohols afforded the related coupled secondary alcohols in moderate to good yields (Scheme 20 ). Yus and co-workers in their studies on the RuCl2(DMSO)4 catalysed α-alkylation of ketones with primary alcohols reported that secondary alcohols 6 can be produced as the main products instead of the homologated ketones 5 by using a double amount of alcohols 1 to ketones 2 (Scheme 3). These results suggested that excess alcohol could also act as reducing agent to convert the α-alkylated ketone 5 to the final product 6 (Scheme 3). Thus, the alkylation of acetophenone (1equiv) with benzyl alcohol (2equiv) afforded 1,3-diphenylpropanol in 78% yield (2mol% RuCl2(DMSO)4, 100% KOH, dioxane, 80°C for 24h) [16a]. With the aim to increase the yield a number of reaction parameters, such as base (KOH, CsOH, K2CO3, NEt3), solvent (1,4-dioxane, toluene, CH2Cl2, THF, DMF, MeCN, DMF, CH2Cl2) and additive (PPh3, Ph2P(CH2)2PPh2, Me2N(CH2)2NMe2, n-Bu4NBr) were examined. After this screening the yield of 1,3-diphenylpropanol was increased up to 82% by using RuCl2(DMSO)4 (2mol%), KOH (100mol%), PPh3 (2mol%), dioxane, 80°C for 24h. Unfortunately, a good yield was obtained only when both reagents, the ketone and the alcohol, were aromatic (Scheme 21 ). The α-alkylation of ketones with alcohols was also carried out under heterogeneous catalysis [29]. Thus, a ruthenium-grafted hydrotalcite (Ru/HT) was easily prepared by treating basic layered double hydroxide, hydrotalcite (HT, Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3) with aqueous RuCl3·nH2O using surface impregnation methods [30]. In one example, this Ru/HT catalyst, possessing both strong surface basicity and oxidation/reduction ability based on the surface metal species, allowed the one-pot α-alkylation of acetophenone with benzyl alcohol to produce 1,3-diphenylpropanone in 85% yield (Scheme 22 )."
4,α-Alkylation of ketones with alcohols to afford chiral alcohols,"2.3 α-Alkylation of ketones with alcohols to afford chiral alcohols An interesting asymmetric reductive α-alkylation of acetophenone derivatives with primary alcohols to afford enantiomerically enriched secondary alcohols by a one-pot sequential reaction requiring two different catalysts, iridium and ruthenium complexes, has been reported [31]. The chiral alcohol product is obtained through two overlapping catalytic cycles (Scheme 23 ). In the first step an achiral iridium-complex dehydrogenates a primary alcohol to the related aldehyde, which then undergoes base-catalysed aldol condensation with the ketone to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Finally, Ir-catalysed hydrogenation gives an α-alkylated ketone, closing the first catalytic cycle. In the second catalytic cycle the newly α-alkylated ketone undergoes enantioselective reductive transfer hydrogenation by the chiral Ru-catalyst to give the optically active elongated alcohol. When acetophenone and n-butanol were reacted in the presence of a catalytic amount of the enantiomeric pure Ru-complex RuCl2(PPh3)(ip-foxap) (27) (Fig. 5 ) and KOH a low to moderate enantioselectivity of the product, 1-phenylhexanol, was achieved. The sequential reaction did not proceed effectively also by using Noyori complexes [32], such as [RuCl(tsdpen)(mesitylene)] (tsdpen= N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)-1,2-diphenylethanediamine), in place of 27. However, when the α-alkylation was carried out in the presence of [IrCl(cod)]2/PPh3 (cod=1,5-cyclooctadiene), followed by the addition of 27 and isopropanol as the reducing reagent, the expected product was obtained with good enantioselectivity (94% ee) (Scheme 24 ). It is noteworthy that the Ir- and Ru-complexes play their role independently in each step. Under typical reaction conditions a number of aryl methyl ketones and aliphatic alcohols gave the related elongated secondary alcohols in moderate to good yields and with high enantiomeric excesses (Scheme 25 ). However, the presence of an electron-withdrawing group at the 4-position of acetophenone decreased the yield. Moreover, benzyl alcohol could not be employed for this reaction. Recently, the same tandem α-alkylation/enantioselective transfer hydrogenation (ATH) process has carried out with one single catalyst [33]. In the reaction of acetophenone with alcohols, [Ru-(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (0.5mol%) in combination with the chiral ligand 28 (1.1mol%) was used as catalyst in the presence of KOt-Bu in DMSO containing LiCl at 65–40°C (Scheme 26 ). DMSO was selected as the solvent because decreased the rate for the acetophenone reduction, while LiCl was used since had a positive effect on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in ATH of ketones with this class of ruthenium catalysts [34]. Under these reaction conditions phenyl alkyl carbinols were obtained in moderate yields (24–42%) and with good enantioselectivities (86–87% ee) (Scheme 26). Acetophenone derivatives, containing either electron-rich or electron-poor substituents, were evaluated in the tandem α-alkylation/ATH with ethanol and n-butanol, affording the related chiral alcohols in low to moderate yields (9–43%) and with good enantiomeric excesses (57–89%) (Scheme 27 ). Examining the reaction products of the tandem α-alkylation/ATH of acetophenone with ethanol under basic conditions in the presence of [D6]DMSO, it was argued that the reaction proceeds via a monohydride ruthenium species."
5,β-Alkylation of alcohols with alcohols,
6,α-Alkylation of alcohols with alcohols to afford alcohols,"3.1 α-Alkylation of alcohols with alcohols to afford alcohols The self-coupling of primary alcohols affording β-alkylated dimer alcohols is known as the Guerbet reaction [35]. In this process a new CC bond is generated by aldol condensation of the aldehyde formed by initial dehydrogenation of the starting alcohol with loss of one equivalent of water and generation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which under the same reaction conditions undergoes final hydrogenation of both the CC bond and formyl group. In the original procedure the self-condensation of the alcohol was promoted by the related sodium alkoxide at very high temperatures (more than 200°C) [35], during which hydrogen transfer occurs from the alcohol, forming the aldehyde, to the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, giving the β-alkylated dimer alcohol. More recently, it has been possible to carry out the Guerbet reaction at lower temperatures ranging from 120 to 140°C by using as catalysts transition metal complexes based on iridium, rhodium and ruthenium [36]. More recently, the reaction has been extended to include also the cross-coupling of two different alcohols by both homo- [37] and heterogeneous catalysis [38]. The first example of a Ru-complex used as homogenous catalyst for the Guerbet reaction appeared in 1972 [39]. In that occasion the system formed from RuCl3·3H2O and 4PBu3 allowed the self-condensation of n-butanol to afford the dimer 2-ethylhexanol in 90% yield (based on the converted alcohol) (Scheme 28 ). However, an interesting and more challenging Guerbet type-reaction is the β-alkylation of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols. This transformation can be achieved according to the general pathway depicted in Scheme 29 . A catalyst temporarily removes hydrogen from both the secondary alcohol 29 and primary alcohol 30 to form the related carbonyl compounds 31 and 32, respectively. These compounds then undergo a cross-aldol reaction under basic conditions to give the α,β-unsaturated ketone 33, which is subsequently hydrogenated to the homologated secondary alcohol 35, via reduction of the intermediate ketone 34 [6,11]. Cho and co-workers developed the first one-pot procedure for the β-alkylation of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols catalysed by a ruthenium catalyst in the presence of a base and a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor [40]. Treatment of 1-phenylethanol (36) with benzyl alcohol (37) (2equiv) in the presence of RuCl2(PPh3)3 (5mol%) and 1-dodecene (5equiv), KOH (300mol%) in dioxane at 80°C for 40h, afforded 1,3-diphenylpropanol (41) in high yield (82%). The role of 1-dodecene is to favour a faster regeneration of the active [Ru] species from the hydride complex, [Ru]H2, formed in the initial oxidation step. In other words, the [Ru]H2 complex reduces 1-dodecene to dodecane restoring [Ru], and so increasing the rate of the Ru-catalysed redox shuttle (Scheme 30 ). In addition, the reduction of the intermediate α,β-unsaturated ketone 39 to ketone 40 and alcohol 41 seemed to be partially assisted by transfer hydrogenation from the solvent dioxane. This was confirmed when 39 was reduced to 40 and 41 in 34% and 32% yields, respectively, by employing RuCl2(PPh3)3 and KOH in dioxane without the use of an alcohol as hydrogen donor. This result was not surprising since dioxane had already demonstrated ability as hydrogen donor in transition-metal-catalysed transfer hydrogenation [26c,41]. Extending the scope of this reaction to a wide range of both secondary alcohols and primary alcohols, homologated secondary alcohols were obtained in moderate to good yields (Scheme 31 ). When 1-tetralol was coupled with benzyl alcohol or 1-butanol under these reaction conditions, the expected β-alkylated secondary alcohols, 2-benzyl-1-tetralol (54%) or 2-butyl-1-tetralol (49%), were formed together with their unreduced carbonyl parents, 2-benzyl-1-tetralone (30%) or 2-butyl-1-tetralone (43%), respectively. A related chemistry was reported by the Yus group using RuCl2(DMSO)4 as the catalyst [42]. In the reaction between 1-phenylethanol and benzylic alcohol a number of reaction parameters such as bases (KOH and KOt-Bu), solvents (toluene, H2O, MeCN, DMSO, 1,4-dioxane, CH2Cl2 and THF) and temperatures (100–120°C) were examined. Under the best reaction conditions (1mol% RuCl2(DMSO)4, 200mol% KOH, dioxane, 100°C), 1,3-diphenylpropanol was obtained in 98% yield after 7days. The reaction gave also good yields when different aromatic secondary and primary alcohols were used (48–98% yields), whereas the results decreased for aliphatic prim-alcohols (R2 = i-Pr, 42% yield) and failed with alkyl sec-alcohols (R1 = n-pentyl, <5% yield) (Scheme 32 ). Interestingly, in some cases the yields could be increased by carrying out the reactions under solvent-free conditions. When this protocol was applied to bicyclic alcohols, α,β-unsaturated ketones were isolated in good yields instead of the expected saturated alcohols (Scheme 33 ). The reason for this fact was tentatively attributed to the difficulty of the Ru-hydride intermediate to reduce the α,β-unsaturated ketones via Michael-type addition [42]. Complexes (terpy)RuCl2(PPh3) (42) and (terpy)IrCl3 (43) (Fig. 6 ), synthesized from terpyridine and RuCl2(PPh3)3 or IrCl3 [43], and other Ru- and Ir-complexes ((terpy)RuCl3, [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, [Cp*RuCl2]2 and [Cp*IrCl2]2) were compared for the β-alkylation of 1-phenylethanol with benzyl alcohol under aerobic reaction conditions (1mol% catalyst and 100mol% KOH in refluxing toluene) (Scheme 34 ) [44]. Complex 42 gave the best results, concerning both yield and selectivity, but (terpy)RuCl3 showed a comparable activity. Other bases (K2CO3, Ca(OH)2 and KOt-Bu) gave whose results. With catalyst 42 the reaction scope was examined by reacting aryl methyl alcohols with a variety of primary alcohol (Scheme 35 ). Satisfactory yields were obtained with all substrates, but incomplete reduction of the ketone intermediates was observed with aliphatic primary alcohols. A study has been very recently reported in which Ru-complexes prepared from the N,N,N-tridentate ligands 44–47 (Scheme 36 ), closely related to terpyridine, were assessed in combination with RuCl3·nH2O in the β-alkylation of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols [45]. The initial screening put out that in the β-alkylation of 1equiv 1-phenylethanol with 1equiv benzyl alcohol in the presence of KOH (20mol%) in toluene at 110°C under N2, the combination of RuCl3·nH2O with 47 gave the best results in terms of conversion (89%) and product selectivity (1,3-diphenylpropanol/1,3-diphenylpropan-1-one=86:14), whereas the Ru-complexes RuCl2(PPh3)3 and [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 demonstrated poor catalytic activity. On these insights the complex 48 was prepared from RuCl3·nH2O and 47 (Scheme 36). With this preformed complex both conversion and selectivity were further improved. Then, the scope of the reaction was examined by the reaction of 1-phenylethanol with benzylic alcohols (Scheme 37 ), and secondary alcohols with benzyl alcohol (Scheme 38 ). Good average results were obtained in both cases. The scope of the reaction was extended to obtain doubly alkylated secondary alcohols. Thus, by reacting cyclohexanol with two equivalents of primary alcohols, dialkylated cyclohexanol derivatives were formed in good yields (Scheme 39 ). Williams and co-workers, in a study on the use of Ru-complexes for alcohol oxidation, performed an experiment where both 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol were present under oxidation conditions [46]. Interestingly, by using PhCHRu(PCy3)2Cl2 and [(p-cymene)RuCl2]2 as catalysts, both alcohols were consumed during the course of the reaction, affording 1,3-diphenylpropanol and 1,3-diphenylpropan-1-one in a ratio of 74:26 and 48:52, respectively (Scheme 40 ). A wide series of Ru-complexes (5mol%) were examined as catalysts in the β-alkylation of 1equiv 1-phenylethanol with 2equiv benzyl alcohol in the presence of 1equiv KOH in dioxane at 80°C for 5h (Scheme 41 ) [47]. Among the assessed complexes, RuCl2(PPh3)2(2-NH2CH2Py) (49) (Fig. 7 ) [48] showed the best catalytic activity, affording the product, 1,3-diphenylpropanol, in 91% yield (Scheme 41, entry 15). Interestingly, under these reaction conditions the complexes RuCl2(PPh2)2 (entry 17) [42], RuCl2(DMSO)4 (entry 18) [42], CpRuCl(PPh3)2 (entry 19) [42] and RuCl2(PPh3)(2′,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine) (entry 20) [44] that were active catalysts in this reaction, gave worse results than 49. Next, the yield of 1,3-diphenylpropanol was increased to >99% carrying out the reaction with 1mol% 49 and replacing KOH with KOt-Bu (1equiv) at 105°C for 5h (Scheme 41, entry 16). These reaction conditions were also efficient to the β-alkylation of aryl (Scheme 42 , Substrates A) and alkyl (Scheme 42, Substrates B) secondary alcohols with aryl and alkyl primary alcohols. A reaction mechanism that has the dihydride complex 50 (Fig. 7) as the key catalytic active metal-complex was also proposed. The four CN chelate ruthenacycles 51a–c and 51d were synthesized via cyclometallation of phenylmethanamine derivatives with [(η6-C6H6)RuCl2]2 (Scheme 43 ) [49]. Screening the activity of these complexes under typical conditions for the β-alkylation of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols (1-phenylethanol (1.0mmol), benzyl alcohol (1.0mmol), catalyst (1.0mol%), toluene (0.3ml), NaOt-Bu (1.0mmol), 110°C), all catalysts afforded similar conversions after 17h reaction, but the highest conversion of the coupled alcohol, 1,3-diphenylpropanol, with respect the ketone by-product, 1,3-diphenylpropanone, was obtained with the complex 51a (Scheme 44 ). The reaction selectivity for the alcohol vs ketone formation lowered by reducing the amount of base and catalyst used, and increasing the reaction temperature and the reaction time. When the reaction was carried out for 48h the formation of the ketone, via dehydrogenation of the alcohol, was predominant. The examination of the scope and limitations of the reaction using catalyst 51a showed that high conversions were obtained in many of cases, except for unsaturated primary alcohols and aromatic secondary alcohols that gave moderate yields of alkylated alcohols and ketones (Scheme 44). The highest reactivity of the complex 51a (and 51d) vs 51b,c was attributed to the presence in this complex of the NH2 moiety, which allows the formation of a hydrogen bond greatly assisting the hydrogen transfer process to generate the key ruthenacycle-hydride species 52 as shown in Scheme 45 . Cyclopentadienyl (Cp) (52–54), hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borato (Tp) (55 and 56), and bipyridine (57) Ru-complexes (Fig. 8 ) catalysed efficiently the β-alkylation of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols (Scheme 46 ) [50]. Among them, the dicationic bipyridine complex 57 was the most performing one, while the Cp and Tp complexes showed in general a lower similar activity. (Hetero)aryl secondary and primary alcohols afforded high conversion, which was significantly reduced when one of the two moieties is an alkyl derivative. Unfortunately, all complexes resulted inactive for the β-alkylation of alkyl methyl carbinols with primary alkyl alcohols. Mechanistic aspects of the Cp and Tp complexes-catalysed reactions were investigated, and key hydrido complexes were identified. In some circumstances, carbonyl complexes formed by aldehyde decarbonylation were detected and, surprisingly, also found active for catalytic processes. Some Ru-catalysts based on N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been applied in the β-alkylation of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols [51–53]. By reaction of the ligand triazolediylidene 59 with the complex [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (14) (Fig. 1), Peris and co-workers obtained the two Ru-complexes 60 and 61 where the biscarbene ligand bears two metal fragments in a facially opposed (Janus-head) disposition (Scheme 47 ) [51]. With these Ru-complexes the β-alkylation of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols in a 1:1molar ratio and a 1mol% catalyst loading in the presence of KOH (100mol%) was studied (Scheme 48 ). Both complexes 60 and 61 gave excellent conversions to alcohol products in toluene solution, showing reaction times that were shorter than those obtained by previously reported catalysts [16,40,42]. On the other hand, reactions using [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 as the catalyst or dioxane as the solvent and Na2CO3 or NaOAc as the base resulted in low conversions to the desired alkylated alcohol. The same research group prepared five different (p-cymene)Ru(NHC) complexes (NHC=imidazolin-2-ylidene, imidazolin-4-ylidene, and pyrazolin-3-ylidene) 62–65 (Fig. 9 ), which were assessed as catalysts in the β-alkylation of 2-phenylethanol and 2-heptanol and four primary alcohols under typical reaction conditions (Scheme 49 ) [52]. All complexes 62–65 afforded good catalytic activities, with the cationic compound 65 showing invariably the best catalytic activity. Significant differences were observed between these catalysts, with the more σ-donating pyrazole-based carbene providing the best activities. Crabtree and co-workers have more recently reported chelating NHC pyrimidine complexes of ruthenium and iridium, which were catalytically active for a variety of significant reactions [53]. In this context, the Ru-complex 67 was prepared in good yield by treatment of 1-pyrimidyl-3-butylimidazolium chloride (66) with Ag2O and transmetallation of the resulting silver carbene to [Ru(p-cymene)2Cl2]2 in the presence of KPF6 (Scheme 50 ). This complex was a poor catalyst in the β-alkylation of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols, affording only 10% conversion after 3h (Scheme 51 ). Beller and co-workers have very recently developed an efficient methylation process of 2-(hetero)aryl ethanols [54] using methanol as C1 feedstock [55]. This process was supposed to occur following the sequence depicted in Scheme 52 . Various Ru- and Ir-pincer-type catalysts were assessed to obtain the methylation of 2-phenylethanol. After a series of optimizations, the combination of two different Ru-complexes, namely Ru-MACHO and Shvo’s diruthenium complex (Fig. 10 ), was essential to achieve this goal. Thus, by using Ru-MACHO (0.1mol%) and Shvo’s complex (0.05mol%), NaOH (0.1equiv) at 140°C for 45h, 2-phenylpropanol was obtained in 87% yield (Scheme 53 , Ar=Ph). The use of this bimetallic system stems from the fact that the Ru-MACHO catalyst does not favour the dehydrogenation of 2-phenylethanol, which is instead promoted by the Shvo’s catalyst. Another important point is that the pressure of the sealed tube must be released to 1atm after heating for 17h and 28h. This procedure was necessary because an increased amount of hydrogen causes deactivation of the catalysts, avoiding the equilibrium to be shifted towards the aldol product (Scheme 52). When this catalyst system was used under optimized reaction conditions to the methylation of a variety of 2-(hetero)aryl ethanols such as pyridine, protection-free indole, benzofuran and benzothiophene scaffolds, a good substrate scope was achieved (Scheme 53)."
7,β-Alkylation of alcohols with alcohols to afford ketones,"3.2 β-Alkylation of alcohols with alcohols to afford ketones The coupling of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols afforded β-alkylated dimer alcohols. However, some very recent papers have reported that the coupling of secondary alcohols with primary and secondary alcohols gives β-alkylated ketones. The first example of this type of homogenous catalysis has been reported by Madsen and co-workers who described the self-coupling of secondary alcohols affording ketone dimers [56]. Optimizing of the reaction conditions for the condensation of 2-hexanol to 7-methylundecan-5-one in the presence of the complex RuCl2(Ii-Pr)(p-cymene) (68) (Fig. 11) was pursued examining different bases (Mg3N2, Li3N, LDA, NaH, Ca3N2, K3PO4, K2CO3, NaHCO3, DBU, KOt-Bu and KOH), solvents (toluene, o-xylene, n-heptane, benzene, 1,4-dioxane and H2O) and additives (PCy3·HBF4 and dppe). From this screening 7-methylundecan-5-one was obtained in 95% yield when a catalytic amount of complex 68 (2mol%) and PCy3·HBF4 (2mol%) with a small excess of KOH (106mol%) in refluxing toluene were used (Scheme 54 ). These optimized reaction conditions also worked well with a range of methyl carbinols (80–95% yields), but failed with acyclic secondary alcohols, which were not sufficiently reactive to undergo the dehydrogenative coupling. Cycloalkanols were converted in good yields, but only cycloheptanol gave complete regioselectivity for the monoalkylated product (70% yield). The self-coupling of 1-phenylethanol 36 was monitored over time by GCMS, highlighting the formation of the related ketone, acetophenone (21a), β-alkylated alcohol 70 and ketone dimer 71 in about 1:1:5:5 ratio after about 2h reaction, but not that of the intermediate α,β-unsaturated enone 69, which most likely hydrogenated rapidly and serves as an in situ generated hydrogen scavenger at the beginning of the reaction (Scheme 55 ). The disappearance of 36 and 21a was observed within 8h, while the 71/70 ratio increased to 2:7, indicating the slow conversion of 70–71. After additional 16h the β-alkylated alcohol 71 was the only product detected and then isolated in 95% yield. Just after, the homo-coupling of 1-phenylethanol catalysed by the Ru- and Ir-based PC(sp3)P pincer complexes 72 and 73 (Fig. 12 ) was reported [57]. After an optimization study, the dehydrogenative coupling of 1-phenylethanol with an equimolar amount of KOH, KOt-Bu or Cs2CO3 (organic bases such as DBU, NEt3 or morpholine were inefficient) in the presence of 72 (2mol%) and molecular sieves, afforded the homo-coupled product, 1,3-diphenylbutanone, in high yield (95%) after heating in xylene at 130°C for 24h. A similar result was obtained with 1-(4-phenyl)ethanol that gave 1,3-bis(4-chlorophenyl)butanone in 89% yield. Complex 72 was less efficient than the related Ir-complex 73, which catalysed these transformations with similar yields, but with a lower loading (1mol%) and in a shorter reaction time (12h). The lower activity of 72 with respect to 73 was attributed to a slow dissociation of the CO ligand from 72 necessary to generate a vacant coordination site [57a]. The optimized reaction conditions were also efficient for the cross-coupling of other aryl methyl carbinols with primary alcohols (87–95% yields), but failed with both catalysts in the cross-coupling of 1-phenylethanol with diphenylmethanol, and in the self-coupling of ethyl phenyl ketone (Scheme 56 ). The ability of these catalysts to afford the ketone product rather than the related alcohol was attributed to the selective reduction of the CC rather than the CO bonds in the intermediate α,β-unsaturated ketone formed in the catalytic cycle. This fact was demonstrated by hydrogenating chalcone, which under a sub-atmospheric hydrogen pressure gave selective and complete conversion into the expected 1,3-diphenylpropanone. A plausible pathway of the one-pot reaction, proceeding via a ligand-metal cooperative mechanism, was also discussed (Scheme 57). The cross-coupling of 1-phenylethanol with aryl an alkyl primary alcohol has been very recently catalysed by the system formed by combining [Ru(cod)2]n with TPA (1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane) in a 1:2molar ratio and in the presence of an equimolar amount of KOt-Bu in toluene at 55°C. In this way 3-phenyl and 3-pentyl substituted 1-phenylpropanones were prepared in good yields after 46h reaction (Scheme 58 ) [58]."
8,β-Alkylation of alcohols with aldehydes to afford alcohols or ketones,"Cho and co workers, after demonstrating that ketones 31 could be coupled with aldehydes 32 to give coupled ketones 34 (RuCl2(PPh3)3 (2mmol%), KOH, dioxane, 80°C) (Scheme 59 , route a) [59], described another Ru-catalysed one-pot coupling mode between secondary alcohols 29 and aldehydes 32. In this reaction the coupled ketones 34 (route b) or the related secondary alcohols 35 (route c) could be obtained by tuning the molar ratio of the alcohol/aldehyde substrates and the absence (Scheme 60 ) or presence (Scheme 61 ) of a hydrogen acceptor [60]. The reaction of 1-phenylethanol with benzaldehyde in the presence of RuCl2(PPh3)3 (0.05mol%) (alcohol/aldehyde=3:1, KOH (3equiv), dioxane, 80°C, 40h), afforded the coupled secondary alcohol, 1,3-diphenylpropanol, in 75% yield with a low amount of the coupled ketone, 1,3-diphenylpropanone (15%) (Scheme 60) [60]. Various secondary alcohols were also subjected to this reaction to give moderate to good yields of β-alkylated secondary alcohols (35–88%) with variable amounts of the related ketones (6–29%) (Scheme 60). When the coupling of 1-phenylethanol with benzaldehyde was carried out under similar reaction conditions (RuCl2(PPh3)3 (0.02mol%), alcohol/aldehyde=1:1, KOH (1equiv), dioxane, 80°C, 40h), but in the presence of 1-dodecene (5equiv) as a hydrogen acceptor, the coupled ketone, 1,3-diphenylpropanone, was isolated as the only product in 63% yield (Scheme 61) [60]. Reacting an array of secondary alcohols with benzaldehyde, low to moderate yields of ketones (20–63%) with very low amounts of alcohols (<3%) were obtained. The reaction proceeds via initial oxidation of the alcohol 29 to the ketone 31, which then undergoes a cross-aldol reaction in the presence of KOH, affording the α,β-unsaturated ketone 33 (Scheme 62 ). Hydrogenation of this compound by a dihydridoruthenium species, generated in the initial oxidation stage, affords the final ketone 34 and/or the alcohol 35. It is presumable that the alcohol 35 comes from hydrogenation of the ketone 34 because this is the almost exclusive reaction product in the presence of a hydrogen acceptor."
9,Alkylation of nitriles with alcohols,"The α-alkylation of phenylacetonitrile (76) with primary and secondary alcohols is known to afford monoalkyl phenylacetonitriles in good to excellent yields since 1971 [61]. However, this reaction requires rather harsh conditions, very high temperatures (210–220°C) and the use of sodium metal. Ten years later Grigg and co-workers reported that the same reaction could be carried out under much milder conditions (refluxing ethanol) through homogeneous catalysts [62]. In this study the alkylation of 76 with ethanol was examined in the presence of Ru-, Rh- and Ir-complexes. Among them RuH2(PPh3)4 was the most active catalyst affording 2-phenylbutanenitrile (77) in 92% yield (Scheme 63 ). The precise nature of the catalyst was uncertain, but the BH mechanism shown in Scheme 64 was in agreement with the experimental results. Ryu and co-workers extended the use of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3, which was efficient to catalyse the alkylation of ketones [17] and acetamides [63], to the alkylation of acetonitrile (78) with alcohols [64]. By using RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 (3–5mol%) in combination with K3PO4 at 110–140°C, a number of benzylic and non-benzylic alcohols was coupled with 78 to give alkylated nitriles in good yields (Scheme 65 ). The use of other bases such as KOt-Bu and Cs2CO3 failed or gave lower yields. Experiments carried out to gain insights into the reaction mechanism showed that the reaction of 78 with benzaldehyde afforded cinnamonitrile in similar yield both in the presence or absence of the Ru-catalyst (Scheme 66 , top). On the other hand, the reaction of cinnamonitrile with benzyl alcohol gave the product, 3-phenylacetonitrile only in the presence of the catalyst (Scheme 66, bottom). These results confirmed that the Ru-catalyst affects the transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated nitriles by alcohols. Recently, Yus and co-workers described the first example of application osmium complexes able to promote the α-alkylation of nitriles with alcohols under BH catalysis [20]. When the alkylation of phenylacetonitrile (76) with benzyl alcohol was performed in a refluxing toluene solution containing 1mol% [Os(η6-p-cymene)(OH)IPr]OTf (25) (Fig. 3) and KOH by removing azeotropically the generated H2O (because complex 25 is also a very efficient catalyst for the hydration of nitriles to amides [21]), 2,3-diphenylpropanenitrile was obtained in 98% yield after only 0.5h. This reaction time is significantly faster than that showed by the iridium dimer [IrCp*Cl2]2, even when the reaction was carried out under microwave irradiation [65]. Under these conditions, the alkylation of aryl acetonitriles with aryl carbinols was accomplished in less than 1h in >90% yield (Scheme 67 ). Also efficient was the reaction of 76 with the aliphatic alcohol n-octanol, giving 2-phenyldecanenitrile in 79% yield within 1.5h. A mechanism for the α-alkylation of aryl acetonitriles catalysed by the Os-complex 25 was also proposed (Scheme 68 )."
10,Alkylation of nitro derivatives with alcohols,"Williams and co-workers found that a combination of a Ru-catalysed alcohol dehydrogenation with an organocatalysed alkene formation affords a new entry to α,β-unsaturated nitro derivatives [66]. Thus, by mixing RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 (79) with Xantphos in a 1:1 ratio, in the presence of piperidinium acetate (as organocatalyst) and crotononitrile (as hydrogen acceptor), total conversion was obtained in the formation of the α,β-unsaturated nitro derivative (E)-1-methyl-4-(2-nitrovinyl)benzene from benzyl alcohol and nitromethane in refluxing toluene within 8h (Scheme 69 ). The total process implies the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde by the Ru-catalyst, followed piperidinium acetate catalysed aldol-type condensation with the nitro derivative. In this reaction the use of piperidinium acetate as co-catalyst was necessary, whereas other co-catalysts such as NEt3, dimethylaminopyridine, pyrrolidine or piperidine led to unreactive systems. Under these reaction conditions a variety of (hetero)aryl carbinols gave good yields of nitroalkene derivatives (Scheme 69)."
11,Alkylation of amides with alcohols,"In the field of the CC bond formation, the alkylation of amides through borrowing hydrogen catalysis represents a challenging area of research, since unlike what happens with activated methylene compounds, whose pK a value is less than ∼20, the α-hydrogens of amides are much less acid. Madsen and Jensen studied a procedure for the direct metal-catalysed alkylation of oxindoles (the pK a of the methylene group in oxindole is 18.2) with alcohols [67]. Thus, iridium and ruthenium complexes were examined for the alkylation of oxindole with n-pentanol. As shown in Scheme 70 a number of systems afforded >95% conversion into the product 3-pentylindolin-2-one at 100°C in the presence of NaOH. Based on this screening, the complex RuCl3·nH2O in combination with PPh3 was used for further studies as this was the most convenient catalytic system. Under optimized reaction conditions (the initial screening included the use of several base and solvents), protected and unprotected oxindoles were selectively alkylated at the 3-position with a variety of (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic alcohols in good to excellent yields (71–92%) (Scheme 71 ). In the alkylation oxindole with 2-propanol, complete conversion was obtained in longer reaction times and with an excess of alcohol (5equiv), thus showing the lower reactivity of secondary alcohols with respect to primary. The use of cyclohexanol and cyclopentanol afforded inseparable mixtures of the unsaturated aldol product and the related hydrogenated product, indicating that for secondary alcohols the hydrogenation of the α,β-unsaturated amide is the rate-limiting step. The alkylation of 4-pentenol afforded a 2:1 mixture of the alkylated product, 3-pentylindolin-2-one, and the related unsaturated oxindole in low yield (27%). An efficient catalytic system for the alkylation of simple acetamides with primary alcohols has been recently reported [63]. The combination of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 with the N,N-bidentate ligands 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10-phenathroline (phen), or the N,N,N-tridentate ligand 2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-6-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine (80), was first explored in the reaction of N,N-dimethylacetamide with benzyl alcohol in the presence of different bases in toluene at 140°C for 18h. The ligands bipy and 80 as additives and KOt-Bu as the base afforded the most efficient catalytic system. Under optimized reaction conditions the scope of the reaction was next extended to a number of primary alcohols (Scheme 72 ). While the addition of bipy was effective only for benzylic alcohols, ligand 80 effected the alkylation reaction when both benzylic and non-benzylic alcohols were used. An amide different from N,N-dimethylacetamide was also successfully alkylated with benzyl alcohol in toluene; thus, 1-morpholinoethanone gave the corresponding amide in 78% yield. In the proposed reaction mechanism the key step is the insertion of the CC bond of the α,β-unsaturated amide into a Ru-hydride bond to afford a ruthenium enolate, which via protonation by an alcohol gives the α-alkylated amide and an alkoxyruthenium complex (Scheme 73 )."
12,"Alkylation of α,α-difunctionalized methylene active compounds with alcohols",
13,Alkylation of β-ketonitriles with alcohols,"8.1 Alkylation of β-ketonitriles with alcohols Williams and co-workers examined the combination of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 (79) with diphosphines in the alkylation of active methylene compounds with alcohols [69]. The study of the reaction of 4,4-dimethyl-3-oxopentanenitrile (81) with benzyl alcohol, carried out in refluxing toluene containing piperidinium acetate (as the base), highlighted that the combination 79 with Xantphos in a 1:1 ratio, is an excellent choice for this reaction, allowing the alkylation process to occur within 3h with only 0.5mol% of catalyst (Scheme 82) [69b]. As highlighted in Scheme 82 the complex 79 showed some catalytic activity in the absence of any added ligands, while the combination of 79 with diphosphines such as Dppe, Dppp, 1,1′-bis(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene (17), Binap (84) and DPEphos (85) (Fig. 13) gave unsatisfactory results. On the other hand, good activity was achieved with 1,1′-bis(di-tert-butylphosphino)ferrocene (82) (Fig. 13). Investigating the combination of 79 with the Xanthene based ligands 86–91 (Fig. 13) having different bite angles it appeared that only two ligands, Sixantphos (87) and Isopropylxantphos (89), provided a reactivity approaching that of the parent Xantphos. This indicates that there is no obvious correlation between the reactivity and the bite angles of the ligands. The system 79/Xantphos was then applied to the coupling of 81 with a number of (hetero)aryl and aliphatic alcohols, providing good yields of the alkylated products (Scheme 74 ). The highly active Xantphos complex RuH2(CO)(Xantphos)(PPh3) (92) and its unreactive dppp analogue RuH2(CO)(dppp)(PPh3) (93) were prepared in order to understand their different catalytic behaviour. When the complex 92 was heated at 120°C for 2h in a toluene solution containing 10equivalents of benzyl alcohol, it was observed the formation of benzene, H2, benzaldehyde and of the complex RuH2(CO)2(Xantphos) (94), which by further heating afforded the tricarbonyl complex Ru(CO)3(Xantphos) (95) (Scheme 75 ). The formation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol is consistent with the capacity of 92 to catalyse the Knoevenagel reaction, while the formation of 94, benzene and H2 indicates that 92 can also cause the decarbonylation of alcohols under non-catalytic conditions. On the other hand, under these reaction conditions no reaction occurred with 93. Complexes 94 and 95 were less active for this catalysis than the parent complex 92, indicating that they are not likely involved in the pathway for the Knoevenagel reaction. In light of these data and those obtained examining the reactivity of 92 with benzaldehyde, a plausible mechanism for the Knoevenagel reaction was proposed (Scheme 76 ). In this catalytic cycle it is important to note the complex 96 coordinating the benzaldehyde fragment. This intermediate can follow two different pathways. One implies the decarbonylation of 96 leading to 95 with consequent catalyst deactivation, while the other entails the dissociation of benzaldehyde from 96 to regenerate a catalytically active ruthenium species that continues in the catalytic cycle. By using a combination of the system RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 and Xantphos in a 1:1 ratio, in the presence of pyrrolidine (NEt3, dimethylaminopyridine and piperidine were less efficient) as the base and crotononitrile (as hydrogen acceptor) in refluxing toluene, 4,4-dimethyl-3-oxopentanenitrile was alkylated with p-tolylmethanol to give the (E)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(4-methylbenzylidene)-3-oxopentanenitrile with 100% conversion (Scheme 77 ) [66]. The Ru-complexes 97–99 and 101, based on N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), were obtained from Ru(Xantphos)(PPh3)(CO)H2 (92) according to Scheme 78 [70]. The complex 101 by thermolysis in the presence of H2CCHSiMe3 affords Ru(ICy)(Xantphos)(CO)H (102), which under H2 reforms 101. Addition of H2 to 97 yields Ru(IEt2Me2)(xantphos)(CO)H2 (100) that under vacuum reforms 97. Complexes 97–99 and 102 catalysed the Knoevenagel reaction of 4,4-dimethyl-3-oxopentanenitrile with benzyl alcohol, although their activity was somewhat lower than that of the complex 92 (Scheme 79 ). The reduced activity of the Ru-complex 92, containing only phosphine ligands, was attributed to its capacity to generate more readily a coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium species."
14,Alkylation of nitrile derivatives with alcohols by Ru-supported catalysts,"8.2 Alkylation of nitrile derivatives with alcohols by Ru-supported catalysts When benzyl alcohol was treated with ruthenium-grafted hydrotalcite (Ru/HT) (Ru=1.5mol%) in toluene at 80°C under an oxygen atmosphere, it was obtained benzaldehyde, which by subsequent treatment with phenylacetonitrile (76) afforded (Z)-2-phenylcinnamonitrile in 98% yield (Scheme 80 ) [29]. This consecutive method was also profitably applicable to other active nitriles such as ethyl cyanoacetate and malononitrile and some heteroaromatic alcohols (Scheme 80). On the other hand, the reaction of 76 with benzyl alcohol (excess) using Ru/HT (Ru: 0.75mol%) at 180°C under argon atmosphere afforded 2,3-diphenylpropionitrile in 77% yield (Scheme 81 ). Other supported Ru-catalysts (Ru/Al2O3, Ru/MgO, Ru/Al(OH)3 and Ru/Mg(OH)2) were much less active. The α-alkylations involving a variety of nitriles with aliphatic and aromatic alcohols using this catalyst gave good results (37–99% yields), with the exception of malononitrile and ethyl cyanoacetate, for which the reaction failed (Scheme 81). The cause responsible for these results was attributed to the low pKa value for the formed and an undesirable base-catalysed transesterification for the latter. Experiments were carried out to clarify the key steps of the reaction mechanism. The reaction of (Z)-2-phenylcinnamonitrile with benzyl alcohol using the Ru/HT catalyst under an argon atmosphere afforded 2,3-diphenylpropionitrile (98% yield) with trace amounts of benzaldehyde, while the parent HT catalyst as well as the Ru/HT system promoted the aldol condensation of 76 with benzaldehyde to give (Z)-2-phenylcinnamonitrile (Scheme 82 ). In addition, two deuterated nitriles were obtained in the α-alkylation of 76 with C6D5CD2OH (Scheme 82). From these results, a plausible reaction pathway based on three consecutive essential reactions was deduced (Scheme 83 ) [29]. α,α-Dialkylated nitriles could be obtained from nitriles by submitting the primary product of α-alkylation to further alkylation without its isolation. Examples of this possibility were reported by Kaneda and co-workers, who used ruthenium-grafted hydrotalcite (Ru/HT) to obtain α,α-dialkylated nitriles through the cooperative catalysis between the grafted-Ru species and the surface base sites on Ru/HT [29a]. As an example, when acrylonitrile was added to a solution in which phenylacetonitrile is reacted with ethanol at 180°C for 20h in the presence of Ru/HT, and then the resulting mixture was heated at 150°C for 1h, a base-catalysed Michael reaction occurred on the unisolated intermediate, 2-phenylbutanenitrile, to afford 2-ethyl-2-phenylglutarodinitrile in 93% yield (Scheme 84 ). In this one pot synthesis of α,α-dialkylated nitriles the ruthenium species and base sites on the Ru/HT surface participate in four consecutive reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of the alcohol to aldehyde, (ii) aldol condensation between the aldehyde and the nitrile, (iii) hydrogenation of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile and final (iv) Michael addition of the alkylated nitrile to the Michael acceptor."
15,Alkylation of malonic acid monoester with alcohols,"8.3 Alkylation of malonic acid monoester with alcohols Williams and co-workers were able to convert for the first time alcohols into doubly homologated esters using BH methodology [71]. Some catalytic systems were initially investigated in the reaction of benzyl alcohol with 3-ethoxy-3-oxopropanoic acid to prepare ethyl dihydrocinnamate 103 (Scheme 85 ). All the examined catalysts were successful to produce 103, although a significant amount of alkene by-product 104 was formed with Ru-catalysts. This problem was overcome by adding isopropanol (20mol%) that acts as a hydrogen donor to replace any H2 lost. The system RuCl2(PPh3)3/KOH was selected to further investigations since it was slightly more effective after 4h reaction, requiring also a lower loading (2.5mol%) with respect to the Ir-catalyst. Under the reaction conditions identified in Scheme 85, a range of alcohols was converted into the doubly homologated esters in good yields, though both aliphatic alcohols and benzyl alcohol with the electron-withdrawing substituent p-trifluoromethyl were less reactive and required a higher catalyst loading to give complete conversion (Scheme 86 ). The same research group combined a Ru-catalysed hydrogen-transfer with an organocatalysed alkene synthesis to obtain a new methodology for the conversion of alcohols into alkenes [65]. By using a combination of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 and Xantphos in a 1:1 ratio, in the presence of pyrrolidine (as the base) (NEt3, dimethylaminopyridine and piperidine were less efficient) and crotononitrile (as hydrogen acceptor) under the conditions reported in Scheme 87 , the reaction of 3-ethoxy-3-oxopropanoic acid with benzyl alcohol afforded ethyl cinnamate in 95% yield. Other aryl alcohols were converted into α,β-unsaturated esters with high (E)-selectivity, while aliphatic alcohols led to mixtures of α,β- and β,γ-alkene regioisomers (Scheme 87). Finally, these reaction conditions were applied to the oxidation/condensation reaction of 4,4-dimethyl-3-oxopentanenitrile with p-tolylmethanol to give tert-butyl (E)-2-cyano-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with 100% conversion."
16,"Alkylation of miscellaneous α,α-difunctionalized methylene active compounds with alcohols","8.4 Alkylation of miscellaneous α,α-difunctionalized methylene active compounds with alcohols The combination of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 with Xantphos (1:1 ratio) was examined for the alkylation of some active methylene compounds with benzyl alcohol in refluxing toluene and in the presence of piperidinium acetate as a base (Scheme 88 ) [69a]. Dibenzyl malonate (105a) and ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (105b) were alkylated in reasonable yields within 24h, but with longer reaction times with respect 4,4-dimethyl-3-oxopentanenitrile (4h, Scheme 75). Both reaction products 106a and 106b were accompanied by a low amount of the intermediate α,β-unsaturated alkenes 107a (9%) and 107b (18%), respectively. Sulfone 105c afforded the saturated product 106c with the unsaturated one 107c in an about 1:1 ratio. The incomplete hydrogenation of the intermediate alkenes 107c to the saturated final products 106c was attributed to the loss of H2 from the catalyst after the dehydrogenation of the benzyl alcohol [45,72]. Taddei group has very recently reported a Ru-catalysed mono alkylation of cyclic 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds with alcohols, which occurs in the presence of a reducing agent and without the use of a base [73]. The reaction of 1,3-indandione (107) with 3-phenyl-1-propanol was initially examined by using Ru3(CO)12, RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 or [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 with or without Xantphos, in a variety of solvents (toluene, 1,4-dioxane, THF and TAA) with or without a base (t-BuOK) in a sealed tube at 160°C (Scheme 89 ). Under all examined reaction conditions a low amount of the alkylated product 109 (up to 25% yield) was obtained, being the main reaction product the bis-adduct 110 derived by Michael addition of 107 to the α,β-unsaturated intermediate 108. This result appeared to indicate that the Michael addition of 107 to the 108 is faster than the reduction of 108–109 effected by the Ru-hydride formed in the dehydrogenation of the alcohol. In order to prevent the formation of 110, it was investigated the effect of the addition to reaction mixture of a stoichiometric amount of the Hantzsch ester 111 (Scheme 89), whose task is to reduce quickly the newly formed α,β-unsaturated intermediate 108–109. With this arrangement the yield of 109 was increased up to 58%, which remained unchanged even when a catalytic amount of 111 (10mol%) was used. The postulated mechanism described in Scheme 90 shows how the Hantzsch ester 111, by reducing the conjugated alkene 108–109, is oxidized to the related pyridine 112 that is reduced to 111 by the Ru-hydride formed in the dehydrogenation of the alcohol, in this way reforming the Ru-catalyst and closing the cycle. Under the optimized reaction conditions a number of cyclic 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds was reacted with alcohols to give moderate to good yields (44–76%) of the related mono alkylated products (Scheme 91 ). Unfortunately, this protocol failed with acyclic 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, but was useful to obtain 3-keto-substituted quinolines by reaction of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds with 2-aminobenzyl alcohol."
17,"Coupling of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes with primary alcohols","Ryu and co-workers reported that the cross-coupling reaction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes with primary alcohols gives 2-hydroxymethyl ketones in the presence of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 as the catalyst [74]. After some optimizations, when a benzene solution of 2-hexenal (0.8mmol) was added by using a syringe pump over the period of 1h to a refluxing benzene solution of benzyl alcohol (0.96mmol), benzaldehyde (0.085equiv) and RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 (0.081mmol), 2-hydroxymethyl-1-phenyl-1-hexanone was obtained in 72% yield after 1h reaction (Scheme 92 ). The slow addition of the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde was required to avoid its dimerization. This procedure, extended to various alcohols and enals, led to good yields of 2-hydroxymethyl ketones (Scheme 92). The supposed reaction pathway that explains the formation of the final reaction products in the case of the coupling of benzyl alcohol with 2-hexenal is outlined in Scheme 93 . Thus, the ruthenium enolate derived from hydroruthenation of 2-hexenal by RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3, undergoes aldol reaction with benzaldehyde. The resulting aldol product gives via β-elimination the α-formylated ketone, whose formyl group is finally hydrogenated by transfer hydrogenation from benzyl alcohol to give the final product 2-hydroxymethyl ketone."
18,"Synthesis of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes from primary alcohols","Porcheddu and co-workers developed a one-pot ruthenium-catalysed hydrogen-transfer strategy for the direct access to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes through the cross-dehydrogenative coupling of two different primary alcohols [75]. They planned a cascade reaction in which a non enolizable aldehyde, generated from the related alcohol by Ru-mediated hydrogen transfer to crotononitrile, is temporarily trapped as an imine (Scheme 94 ). Next, the Mannich-type condensation between the grafted imine species and a second aldehyde, in turn generated from the corresponding primary alcohol, gives the α,β-unsaturated coupling product. This one-pot protocol was developed in a progressive way. First, the reaction between benzyl alcohol and methylamine was optimized to obtain N-methyl-1-phenylmethanimine, which was efficiently formed by using RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 (4mol%) in combination with Xantphos (4mol%) in the presence of crotononitrile (1.1mol%), as a hydrogen scavenger, under microwave (MW) dielectric heating. Next, the possibility to obtain the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, 2-benzylideneheptanal, by adding an aliphatic primary alcohol, heptanol, to the mixture containing the in situ generated imine, N-methyl-1-phenylmethanimine, and the Ru-catalyst, was examined. Interestingly, the ruthenium-Xantphos system was able to achieve the oxidation of both alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes (benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and heptanol to heptanal) and the subsequent Mannich-type reaction. Finally, the one-pot reaction sequence was pursued. After further optimizations, including the substitution of methylamine with a silica-grafted primary amine, 2-benzylideneheptanal was obtained in 75% yield under the following reaction conditions: RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 (0.6mmol), Xantphos (0.6mmol), crotononitrile (5mmol), benzyl alcohol (3mmol), heptanol (1mmol), grafted amine (0.9mmol), MW, 120°C, 3h (Scheme 95 ). The validity of this procedure was then demonstrated by thirty examples, which afforded α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to good yields (Scheme 95)."
19,Indirect Wittig-type reaction,"Another approach to CC bond forming reactions involving BH methodology is the synthesis of alkane derivatives by both the indirect Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons and Wittig reactions. This way was first explored by Williams and co-workers, who by a domino reaction sequence obtained directly alkane derivatives from alcohols and phosphorus-containing olefinating agents (Scheme 96 ) [76]. In the catalytic cycle the alcohol is dehydrogenated by the catalyst to the related carbonyl compound, which undergoes olefination with the ylide present in the reaction mixture to give the alkene intermediate. Then, the hydride complex, formed in the alcohol dehydrogenation step, hydrogenates the intermediate alkene, and so completing the reaction sequence that provides the final longer chain alkane derivative. In these early examples the combination [Ir(cod)Cl]2 and dppp was employed to catalyse the reaction between alcohols and phosphonium ylides. Unfortunately, while the expected alkane products were obtained in acceptable yields (14–71%), the reaction conditions were harsh (150°C) and the reaction scope was somewhat limited [76]. Next the same research group described a ruthenium N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex catalysed approach to the indirect Wittig process requiring milder reaction conditions [77]. Thus, the N-aryl substituted NHC dihydride complex, Ru(IMes)(PPh3)2(CO)H2 (113, IMes=1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) (Scheme 97 ), which works in the transfer hydrogenation between alcohols and alkenes [74], was compared with the ruthenium complex RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 (79), alone or in combination of IMes, in the reaction depicted in Scheme 98 . The highest level of activity was achieved with the complex 113, but also the complex 79 and that in situ generated from 79 and IMes were highly active (Scheme 97). Using optimized reaction conditions (1mol% 113, 2mol% trimethyl(vinyl)silane, toluene, 80°C, 24h) the scope of the reaction was extended to a number alternative phosphorane ester ylides and (hetero)arylalcohols, which afforded the related saturated esters in good to excellent yields (70–84%) (Scheme 99 ). The role played by a catalytic amount of vinylsilane (2mol%) present in the reaction mixture is to accept hydrogen from the dihydride complex 113, and so allowing the initial formation of the catalytic active complex 114 (Scheme 97). This complex then removes hydrogen from the alcohol to form the aldehyde and regenerate 113, which closes the catalytic cycle by hydrogenating the CC bond of the α,β-unsaturated ester, formed in the reaction of benzaldehyde with the ylide. In the light of the high activity showed by the complex 113, a wide assortment of ruthenium NHC complexes bearing different N-substituted ligands were next prepared and assessed in the indirect Wittig reaction [79]. Complexes 115–119 were readily prepared upon heating RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 (79) with the appropriate NHC precursor, while heating of 79 with 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene (Ii-Pr2Me2) gave the complex 120, resulting from CH activation of an isopropyl methyl group in the NHC ligand (Scheme 100 ). These Ru-complexes showed only small differences in activity, with the complex 120 being the most active, when the Wittig reaction of benzyl alcohol with the cyano ylide Ph3PCHCN was carried out at 80°C for 24h. The best catalytic activity of 120 was manifest when the reaction time was shortened to 3h and the temperature lowered to 70°C. Moreover, the high activity 120 was also maintained when the catalyst was prepared in situ by mixing Ii-Pr2Me2 with Ru-79 in a 1:1 ratio. Then, various aryl alcohols were reacted with Ph3PCHCN in the presence of 5mol% 120 at 70°C for 2h, giving good conversions to α,β-unsaturated nitriles (54–86%) containing low amounts (1–7%) of the related saturated nitriles (Scheme 101 ). Examining the reactivity of 120, the addition of H2 or i-PrOH to 120 produced the dihydride complex 121, which so was also likely formed in the oxidation of the alcohol to the aldehyde in the first step of the catalytic Wittig reaction. Interestingly, the reaction of 121 with an excess of H2CCHSiMe3 at 50°C regenerated 120 together with its isomer 122 bearing the trans PPh3 ligands (Scheme 102 )."
20,Synthesis of γ-butyrolactones,"Beller and co-workers have very recently described the Ru-catalysed synthesis of γ-butyrolactones from 1,2-diols and malonates using BH methodology [80]. They assumed that the CC and CO bonds should proceed according to the domino sequence reported in Scheme 103 . Dehydrogention by the catalyst [Ru] of one of the two hydroxy group in 123 provides the related 1,2-hydroxyketone 124 and [Ru]H2, whose carbonyl group undergoes a Knoevenagel reaction with the malonate affording the unsaturated compound 125. The CC bond of this compound is then hydrogenated by [Ru]H2 to give 126 and regenerating [Ru]. Compound 126 undergoes in basic medium decarboxylative reaction and then lactonization to give the final lactone product. To achieve this goal a number of Ru-catalysts (Ru3CO12, Ru3CO12/CataCXiumPCy Ru3CO12/Xantphos [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2, RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3, Ru-MACHO and Ru-MACHO-BH) (Fig. 14 ), bases (t-BuOH, NaOH, Cs2CO3 and K2CO3) and solvents (t-amyl alcohol, toluene and 1,4-dioxane) were assessed in order to optimize the synthesis of 5-butyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one by reaction of 1,2-hexanediol and diethyl malonate in base medium (Scheme 103, R1 =R2 =Me). Under optimized conditions (Ru–MACHO–BH, K2CO3, t-amyl alcohol at 150°C for 18h) the expected γ-butyrolactone was obtained in 61% yield. This protocol was extended to different 1,2-diols allowing getting a variety of γ-butyrolactones in 22–63% yields (Scheme 104 ). The use of different malonates did not permit to increase the yield of the lactonization, and the reaction with a monoester (ethyl hydrogen malonate) did not take place. 2-Substituted malonates were also applied in this protocol (Scheme 104). The reaction between cyclohexane-1,2-diol and diethyl methylmalonate afforded the α,β-unsaturated lactone 128 (55% yield) instead of the expected saturated lactone. These observations show that under the reaction conditions the formed ruthenium hydride [Ru]H2 is not able to hydrogenate the tetrasubstituted CC bond, thus indicating that for the continuation of the reaction the catalytic active species [Ru] must be generated by loss of gaseous H2 from [Ru]H2. Moreover, the elimination of H2O to form the α,β-unsaturated lactone should take place in the last steps of transformation, in other words after decarboxylation and lactonization. The reaction with 2-butyl malonate afforded the corresponding trisubstituted α,β-unsaturated lactone 129 in 50% yield as a mixture of isomers, while diethyl phenyl malonate curiously gave both the α,β-unsaturated lactone 130 and the related saturated lactone in 30 and 56% yield, respectively (Scheme 105 )."
21,Redox triggered CC coupling of alcohols,"Krische and co-workers developed a new method, conceptually related to the hydrogen auto-transfer process, which is based on metal catalysed alcohol-unsaturate transfer hydrogenative CC coupling. Unlike the borrowing hydrogen methodology in which alcohols are converted into the final saturated products containing the alcohol fragment via a oxidation–condensation–reduction pathway, the Krische methodology affords products of carbonyl addition through hydrogen transfer from the starting alcohol to a π-unsaturated substrate (allenes, dienes, alkynes, enynes and alkenes) to generate a electrophile-nucleophile pair that leads to CC bond formation (redox-triggered carbonyl addition) (Scheme 106 ) [7]. A unique feature of this process is to realize formal CH functionalization of the alcohol at the carbinol carbon through the introduction of a nonstabilized carbanion equivalent. In the general mechanism the alcohol is dehydrogenated by the catalyst [X-MLn] to generate the related aldehyde (or ketone) and a metal-hydride [MLn]-H, which adds to an unsaturated compound (hydrometalation) to produce a metal σ-species (Scheme 106). This species engages the carbonyl compound in a nucleophile–electrophile interaction to form a metal-alkoxide adduct that gives the final alcohol product and releases the catalyst [MLn] to close the cycle. In this catalytic cycle the hydrogen initially removed by the catalyst from the alcohol starting material is stepwise reintroduced in the final product in a catalysed redox neutral process. As an example that corroborates this mechanism, but-3-en-1-yn-1-ylbenzene was coupled to phenylmethan-d 2-ol under the conditions reported in Scheme 107 [81]. Deuterium was completely retained at the benzylic methine of the product 131 (>95%), while transfer of the benzylic deuteride to the allylic methyl group (56%) and allylic methine position (24%) was observed, so indicating a reversible olefin-hydrometalation (Scheme 107). Ru-catalysed transfer hydrogenation of alcohols in the presence of π-unsaturated reactants provides hydrohydroxyalkylation and hydroacylation of allenes, dienes, 1,3-enynes and alkynes with primary and secondary alcohols. Since this topic has been recently reviewed [7] as well as the stereoselective versions of these reactions [82], this paper centers its interest to summarize the results obtained in these transformations by a number of Schemes, rather than on a deep discussion on the reaction mechanisms."
22,Primary alcohols,"13.1 Primary alcohols 13.1.1 Hydrohydroxyalkylation of allenes Ru-catalysed processes were developed for the introduction of an allyl group into a carbonyl compound (carbonyl allylation) derived from a primary alcohol. In such processes, primary alcohols serve both as aldehyde precursors and hydrogen source, which is reintroduced into a π-unsaturated reactant (allene or diene) to form an allylruthenium species. Finally, aldehyde-allylruthenium interaction brings to the couple product, crotyl alcohol or β,γ-unsaturated ketone, depending on the reaction conditions. The application of this protocol to alcohols and allenamides in the presence of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and dppf resulted in products of carbonyl aminoallylation as single anti-diastereomers (Scheme 108 ) [83]. The coupling reaction of alcohols with 1,1-disubstituted allenes was examined under a variety of reaction conditions, including various Ru-complexes derived from a combination of RuHX(CO)(PPh3)3 (X=Cl, OMs, O2PBinol and O3Scam) with ligands dppf, dCyPf and PPh2Cy, reaction temperatures, etc, affording products of hydrohydroxyalkylation in good yields and with complete branched regioselectivity (Scheme 109 ) [84]. Very recently, essentially the same reaction conditions used for the Ru-catalysed transfer hydrogenative coupling of alcohols to allenes and allenamides were efficient also when fluorinated alcohols were used as starting material, though in this circumstance longer reaction times were required (Scheme 110 ). The reactions furnish homoallylic alcohols bearing all-carbon quaternary centers with good to complete levels of diastereoselectivity [85]. 13.1.2 Hydrohydroxyalkylation and hydroacylation of 1,3-dienes Under the conditions of Ru-catalysed hydrogen autotransfer, simple acyclic 1,3-dienes such as 1,3-butadiene, isoprene and 2,3-dimethylbutadiene were coupled to a variety of alcohols to give products of carbonyl allylation (Scheme 111 ) [86]. RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 promoted the formation of the desired coupled product in good yield and with excellent regioselectivity (>95:5), but low diastereoselectivity. Notably, the addition of m-nitrobenzoic acid was critical since only trace quantities of product were observed in its absence. Moreover, in most cases, the addition to the reaction mixture of phosphine ligands, P(p-MeOC6H4)3 or rac-BINAP, improved the yields. Next, the direct CC coupling of ethanol to 2-substituted dienes was examined (Scheme 112 ) [87]. By using RuH(O2CC7F15)(CO)(dppb)(PPh3) as the catalyst, a number of butadienes was converted to the CC coupling products 132 and 133 in good yields as mixtures of constitutional isomers (132/133 =1:1–7:1). Notably, the alcohol product 132 is predominantly formed indicating that the CC coupling occurs at the diene quaternary carbon, with the consequent diastereoselective formation of a quaternary center. As noted above, low levels of diastereoselectivity were achieved in the Ru-catalysed carbonyl allylation with butadiene and simple dienes (Schemes 111 and 112). This results was attributed to incomplete partitioning of the (Z)- and (E)-σ-crotylruthenium intermediates, which give syn- and anti-diastereomers, respectively, in a highly ordered closed transition state. Since 2-silyl-substituted butadienes were known to adopt a “pseudo-(Z)-σ-crotylmetal” geometry by virtue of allylic strain [88], modified Ru-catalysts were examined in order to generate products of carbonyl syn-crotylation. Thus, upon exposure of primary alcohols to buta-1,3-dien-2-yldimethyl(phenyl)silane in the presence of chiral Ru-catalysts obtained by combining RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and (R)-DM-SEGPHOS or (S)-SEGPHOS, products of carbonyl crotylation are formed with high levels of syn-diastereoselectivity, as well as good enantioselectivity (Scheme 113 ) [89]. In the Ru-catalysed carbonyl allylation from alcohols with butadiene low syn-diastereoselectivities were achieved because the (Z)- and (E)-σ-crotylruthenium intermediates are very close in energy and so hard to discriminate (Schemes 111 and 112). The syn-diastereoselectivity could be increased only when butadiene bearing a 2-silyl substituent was used (Scheme 113). Based on the assumption that the increase of the steric congestion at the ruthenium center of the (E)- and (Z)-σ-crotylruthenium intermediates should favour the formation of the thermodynamically more stable (E)-isomer, Ru-complexes bearing a number of counterions of variable size were examined. These complexes were prepared in situ by acid-base reaction of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3, dppf, and organic acids (HX) (Scheme 114 , top). After extensive investigations the anti-diastereoselectivity increased with the increasing size of the counterion. The best stereoselectivity resulted with the BINOL-derived phosphoric acid 134, which gives α-methyl homoallylic alcohols with good anti-diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity (Scheme 114, bottom) [90]. On the other hand, syn-diastereoselectivity was observed by the catalyst system derived from RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3, (S)-SEGPHOS and the TADDOL-derived phosphoric acid 135 (Scheme 115 ) [91]. Interestingly, the diastereo- and enantioselectivity observed in this circumstance was the opposite of that found by using dppf or (S)-SEGPHOS in combination with the BINOL-derived phosphate counterion from 134. In the Ru-catalysed coupling of alcohols to allenes and dienes, the dehydrogenation of the starting alcohol to the carbonyl compound occurs quickly, whereas that of the alcohol-containing product does not happen at all. This fact has been attributed to the coordination of the formed homoallylic olefin to ruthenium to generate a coordinatively saturated homoallylic Ru-alkoxide complex that is incapable of β-hydride elimination. Based on this background, the use of highly coordinatively unsaturated Ru-complexes favoured the oxidation of the initially formed homoallylic alcohol affording the β,γ-unsaturated ketone. Thus, by using the catalyst Ru(O2CCF3)H(CO)(PPh3)2, generated in situ by acid-base reaction of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 and CF3CO2H, the coupling of simple dienes (1,3-butadiene, isoprene and 2,3-dimethylbutadiene) with a number of alcohols gives β,γ-unsaturated ketones in high yields (Scheme 116 ) [92]. Therefore, products of diene hydrohydroxyalkylation or hydroacylation are accessible from alcohols by a careful choice of the reaction conditions. 13.1.3 Hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3-dienes It has been very recently reported that the Ru-catalyst generated from RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and 1,3-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)propane (dCypp) promotes the formal hydroaminoalkylation of 4-aminobutanol with butadiene and higher conjugated dienes to form in good yields 2-substituted pyrrolidines with complete levels of branched regioselectivity and good to excellent levels of anti-diastereoselectivity (Scheme 117 ) [93]. 13.1.4 Hydrohydroxyalkylation of 1,3-enynes Under conditions of Ru-catalysed CC bond-forming transfer hydrogenation, carbonyl propargylation from alcohols has been achieved employing 1,3-enynes as surrogates to preformed allenylmetal reagents. In this process, hydrogen transfer from the primary alcohol to the 1,3-enyne generates aldehyde-allenylruthenium pairs, which combine to form products of carbonyl propargylation. Specifically, in the presence of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3/dppf, under optimal reaction conditions, a series of enynes and alcohols combine regioselectively to furnish homopropargyl alcohols in good to excellent yields (Scheme 118 ) [94]. 13.1.5 Hydrohydroxyalkylation and hydroacylation of alkynes Under the conditions of Ru-catalysed transfer hydrogenation direct CH vinylation of alcohols employing alkynes as vinyl donors has been achieved [95]. After extensive optimizations, the heating in a sealed tube at 95°C of a THF solution of 2-butyne with a series of primary alcohols, and in the presence of Ru(O2CCF3)2(CO)(PPh3)2 and isopropyl alcohol gave the expected products of CH vinylation in good yields (Scheme 119 ). Allylic alcohols were generated together with variable amounts of the related enones (<1–20%), whose formation was minimized by adding isopropyl alcohol. However, under lightly different reaction conditions, namely higher temperature and longer reaction times without the use of isopropyl alcohol, enones were formed in good to excellent yields with complete (E)-stereoselectivity (Scheme 120 ) [96]. Scheme 119 illustrates that alkynes, acting like vinyl donors, couple with primary alcohols to form allylic alcohols. Next studies were carried out to investigate the use of alkynes as allyl donors under Ru-catalysed transfer hydrogenation. As a result of these investigations a cationic Ru-complex, generated through the acid-base reaction of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 and 2,4,6-(i-Pr)3C6H2SO3H, catalysed the redox-triggered CC coupling of alkynes and primary alcohols to furnish (Z)-homoallylic alcohols with good to complete control of olefin geometry (Scheme 121 ) [97]. A series of deuterium labeling experiments corroborated a catalytic reaction pathway wherein a geometrically defined oxaruthenacycle is formed via alkyne-to-allene isomerization followed by allene-carbonyl oxidative coupling (Scheme 121). In a more recent advance, key alterations to the reaction conditions that suppress allene-carbonyl oxidative coupling of the transient allene to favour allene hydrometalation were disclosed, resulting in the catalytic enantioselective carbonyl allylation using alkynes as chiral allylmetal equivalents (Scheme 122 ) [98]."
23,Secondary alcohols,"13.2 Secondary alcohols 13.2.1 Hydrohydroxyalkylation of dienes It was postulated that a Ru(0)-catalyst could promote alcohol CC coupling in which alcohol dehydrogenation directs carbonyl-diene oxidative coupling to metallacyclic intermediates, which give products of carbinol CH hydrohydroxyalkylation (Scheme 123 , top). Moreover, it was also assumed that the metallacyclic intermediates might be intercepted via allylruthenation onto a tethered carbonyl functionality to give products of cycloaddition (Scheme 123, bottom). According to these hypotheses, the Ru-catalyst generated from Ru3(CO)12 and tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) facilitated the redox-neutral CC coupling of aryl substituted α-hydroxy esters with isoprene (Scheme 124 , substrates A) and myrcene (Scheme 124, substrates B) to give products of carbinol CH prenylation and geranylation, respectively, with exclusive regioselectivity to the terminal part of the less substituted CC bond of the diene [99]. Mechanistic studies supported a catalytic pathway involving diene-carbonyl oxidative coupling. This protocol was also successfully applied to substituted 3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles. Exposure of theses substrates to isoprene or myrcene results in direct secondary carbinol CH prenylation and geranylation, respectively (Scheme 125 ) [100]. Moreover, other dienes such as butadiene and cyclohexadiene, in addition to isoprene or myrcene, worked equally well in this secondary alcohol CC couplings [100]. The structural homology between α-hydroxy esters and 3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles with certain heteroaromatic carbinols suggested the feasibility of engaging heteroaromatic secondary alcohols in Ru(0)-catalysed diene hydrohydroxyalkylation. Thus, for instance, 2-pyridinyl secondary alcohols were coupled with dienes in the presence of the Ru(0)-catalyst generated from Ru3(CO)12 and PCy3, enabling direct conversion of secondary to tertiary alcohols (Scheme 126 ) [101]. The second assumption has been more recently demonstrated. Thus, 1,2-diols and their oxidized forms (hydroxyketones and diones) were involved in a [4+2] cycloaddition with an array of conjugated dienes (Scheme 127 ) [102]. In this circumstance the process is promoted by the Ru-system formed by Ru3(CO)12 and 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (Biphen). For this process a reaction mechanism implying diene-carbonyl oxidative coupling, followed by intramolecular carbonyl addition from the resulting allylruthenium intermediate was proposed. 13.2.2 Hydrohydroxyalkylation of α,β-unsaturated esters Krische and co-workers argued that transient oxaruthenacycles could be formed by Ru(0)-catalysed hydrohydroxyalkylation of acrylates with vicinal diols, to provide by spontaneous cyclization lactone products (Scheme 128 , bottom) [103]. Thus, after reaction optimizations the Ru(0)-catalyst derived from Ru3(CO)12 and 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)propane (dppp), in the presence of 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid as a cocatalyst, allowed the hydrohydroxyalkylation of methyl acrylate with vicinal diols to afford spirolactones in good yields (Scheme 128) [103]. When methyl 2-(hydroxymethyl)acrylate was used as an acrylate derivative, diols afforded α-exo-methylene-γ-butyrolactones (Scheme 129 , top). Finally, the reaction of substituted methyl acrylate with N-benzyl-3-hydroxyindole was also investigated. It gave the related spirolactones in high yields (Scheme 129, bottom). In this circumstance, a catalytic amount of potassium tert-butoxide was necessary to achieve high levels of diastereoselectivity. The results obtained in the coupling of dienes with 3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles, which occur through a metallacycle intermediate, suggested the possibility to investigate the coupling of α-olefins. The Ru(0)-catalyst generated from Ru3(CO)12 and PCy3, promoted direct CC coupling of α-olefins and styrenes with N-benzyl-3-hydroxyindole to form in high yields branched products of hydrohydroxyalkylation with very high diastereoselectivities (Scheme 130 ) [104]. Since this catalytic system was efficient only when 3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles were used as the substrates, the same research group has considered new possibilities and found very recently that osmium(0) catalysts overcome this limitation, allowing the transfer hydrogenative CC coupling of ethylene and higher α-olefins with diols, α-ketols, and α-hydroxy esters [105]. In the coupling of ethyl mandelate with ethylene in the presence of the Ru3(CO)12 or Os3(CO)12 in combination with phosphine ligands (PCy3, CyJohnPhos, RuPhos and XPhos) under the reaction condition of Scheme 131 , only Os-complexes were able to afford the expected tertiary alcohol product (Scheme 131, top, R=Ph), with the Os-complex modified by XPhos giving the best yield (78%). Under these reaction conditions a variety of aryl α-hydroxy esters were converted into the related α-tert-hydroxy esters in good yields (Scheme 131). The extension of this procedure to functionalized olefins also gave good results, but the reaction conditions required an optimization according to the substrate (Scheme 131, bottom). The same procedure worked well also with cyclic α-ketols (Scheme 132 , top) and 1,2-diols (Scheme 132, bottom), affording in this case α-tert-hydroxy ketones. The coupling of α-hydroxy esters and 1,2-diols is a redox-neutral transformation, while the coupling of α-ketols is an oxidative process in which 1equiv of H2 is evolved or transferred to an acceptor (ethylene). Finally, this procedure was applied to the coupling of α-hydroxy carbonyl compounds with 1-octene, giving α-tert-hydroxy ketones in high yields (Scheme 133 ). These reactions to proceed often required the presence of adamantane carboxylic acid (10mol%) as a cocatalyst, which facilitates the opening of the oxa-osmacycle postulated as a key intermediate in the reaction mechanism. 13.2.3 Hydrohydroxyalkylation of alkynes Very recently, α-hydroxy-β,γ-unsaturated ketones have been prepared in good to excellent yields by regio- and stereoselective alkyne-diol hydrohydroxyalkylation in the presence of the Ru(0)-catalyst formed in situ from Ru3(CO)12 and PCy3 (Scheme 134 ) [106]. In the postulated simplified mechanism, a 1,3-dione is initially formed by successive [Ru3(CO)12]-catalysed transfer hydrogenation from the starting diol to the alkyne, which is converted into the related alkene (Scheme 134, bottom). Then, the Ru(0)-complex promotes oxidative coupling of the dione and alkyne to form an oxaruthenacycle, which via protonolytic cleavage by 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid forms a Ru-carboxylate. This intermediate through a Ru-alkoxide generates, by β-hydride elimination, a Ru-hydride that undergoes CH reductive elimination to furnish the final product and the Ru-complex to its zero-valent form. The reaction products by treatment with p-TsOH in m-xylene at 80°C undergo acid-catalysed cyclodehydration to form tetrasubstituted furans in moderate to good yields (Scheme 134, top). 13.2.4 Vinylation of α-hydroxy carbonyl compounds and 1,2-diols A strategy for the catalytic vinyl transfer from enol carboxylates to activated secondary alcohol CH bonds via Ru- and Os-catalysed transfer hydrogenation has been developed by Krische’s group [107]. After extensive optimizations the reaction of ethyl mandelate with vinyl pivalate in the presence of the catalytic system formed by Os3(CO)12 and XPhos afforded the vinylation product, ethyl 2-hydroxy-2-phenylbut-3-enoate, in 82% yield (Scheme 135 , R1 =t-Bu, R2 =H), whereas Ru3(CO)12 and XPhos gave only 20% yield. The generality of this process was next examined with respect to the vinyl donor by the complex Os3(CO)12-XPhos. This study showed that the structure of the vinyl donor plays a pivotal role in the yield of the final product (Scheme 135). Thus, for instance, the reaction of ethyl mandelate with 1-cyclopropylvinyl pivalate failed to give the expected vinyl alcohol, which was instead obtained by using the corresponding 2,2,2-triphenylacetate. The reaction was assumed to occur through an oxidative coupling–metallacycle fragmentation pathway (Scheme 135, top). N-Benzyl-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole was also subjected to a parallel set of vinyl transfer experiments (Scheme 136 ). High yields of the vinylation products were obtained, but also in this case the nature of the vinyl donor was very critical. Thus, the oxindole vinylation with both 1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)vinyl acetate and 1-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)vinyl acetate failed, whereas the use of the corresponding pivalate afforded the expected vinylation products in very good yields (94 and 90%, respectively). Finally, the vinyl transfer from enol carboxylates to diols was explored. These reactions are oxidative process and therefore required and excess of vinyl donor as sacrificial hydrogen acceptor. The results reported in Scheme 137 show as good results of α-hydroxy-α-vinyl ketones were generally obtained under the aforesaid conditions, although once again the type of vinyl donor is of considerable importance on the product yield. Thus, for example, the vinylation of trans-indane-1,2-diol with vinyl pivalate gave 2-hydroxy-2-vinylacenaphthylen-1(2H)-one in 60% yield, while the vinylation of the same substrate with 1-cyclopropylvinyl 2,2,2-triphenylacetate failed."
24,Conclusions,"After the first report in 1981 on the use of ruthenium complexes in borrowing hydrogen (BH) catalysis, a number of these metal-complexes have been developed, allowing the designing of an array of highly productive catalysts for the synthesis of chiral and non-chiral compounds. Despite the large number of ruthenium complexes employed in BH processes, the use of osmium complexes is still extremely limited. Moreover, applications of both Ru- and Os-complexes in BH catalyses in addition to those described in this review, such as, for instance, the α-alkylation of methyl N-heteroaromatics or the methylation and hydroxymethylation by using methanol as starting material are missing. We hope that this review will act as an useful reference to scientists currently working in this area, and will be an inspiration for further research aimed to provide easily accessible and more efficient Ru- and Os-catalysts able to perform known reactions under less drastic reaction conditions, hopefully at ambient temperature, to synthesize complex target molecules, and to promote the study of new waste-free and environmentally benign carbon–carbon bond forming processes for the production of chemical materials not only on laboratory scale, but also on large scale (fine chemicals)."
