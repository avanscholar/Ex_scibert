0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered to be the cleanest energy and effective alternative to fossil fuels, because of its high energy yield of 120 MJ/kg, which is almost 3 folds greater than that of hydrocarbon fuels (Lu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2019a,b), 3 and 5 folds more than gasoline and ethanol (Li et al., 2019). In the context of “Peak CO2 emissions & Carbon neutrality”, H2 energy will make important contributions to the carbon emission reduction and carbon neutralization. The energy revolution brought by hydrogen energy has set off an upsurge all over the world(Zhao et al., 2019c). As a secondary energy fuel, H2 could not only be produced efficiently through electro- or thermo-chemical methods from water, but also from various kinds of feedstocks, such as biomass and organic wastes, or other non- and renewable substrates (Li et al., 2019). Among the exiting methods, biological H2 (bio-H2) production through biomass conversion has been substantially developed and led widespread concern for its mild reaction conditions, organic wastes recycling and environmental benefits (Wang and Yin, 2019). In the process of beer production, brewery wastewater (BW) with 3–10 folds of beer output was produced (Chen et al., 2016), which presents characteristics for the bio-H2 production with high content of maltose, soluble starch and total suspended solids (Boboescu et al., 2014; Golub et al., 2014). H2 yields of 1.5 mol-H2/mol-fructose and 1.3 mol-H2/mol-sucrose were obtained in BW fermentations mixed with low concentration fructose or sucrose by subtropical sludge, indicating a favorite by anaerobic bacteria (Pachiega et al., 2019). H2 production enhancement was achieved by aqueous phase reforming (Oliveira et al., 2020), or adding Klebsiella pneumoniae as initial inoculum (Arantes et al., 2020) in actual or synthetic BW. Although bio-H2 recoveries from BW have been performed, investigations on efficiency enhancements should be carried out for further actual applications. In the present study, a maltose-preferring butyrate-type fermentative bio-H2 producer of Clostridium butyricum NH-02 was investigated for the H2 production potential from simulated BW. The initial pH and organic loading were optimized to enhance the H2 yield in batch cultures. The characteristics and stimulation of H2 yield from simulated BW under the optimal feeding interval time (FIT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) were investigated in semi-continuous fermentation. The experimental results provide new ideas for the subsequent treatment and disposal of brewery wastewater, and also hydrogen production enhancement from biomass."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and media,"2.1 Inoculum and media C. butyricum NH-02 used in this study was a maltose-preferring bio-H2 producer and maintained in the Environmental Molecular Ecology Laboratory of Northeastern University, China (Wang et al., 2020). The seed medium was the modified PYM medium: 10 g/L maltose, 4 g/L peptone, 1 g/L yeast powder, 14.33 g/L Na2HPO4 · 12H2O, 3.63 g/L KH2PO4, 0.1 g/L FeSO4 · 7H2O, 0.5 g/L MgCl2 · 6H2O, L-cysteine 0.5 g/L, initial pH 7.0. The medium was prepared in anaerobic bottles as described in our previous studies (Zhao et al., 2019a). The pure seed culture was performed in 100-mL anaerobic bottles with 50 mL medium at 35 °C for 36 h."
3,Preparation of simulated BW,"2.2 Preparation of simulated BW The simulated BW was prepared with Snow Beer (China Resources Snow Breweries) with an original wort concentration of 11.5 P and alcoholicity of >4.1% vol. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) was at 100,000–120,000 mg/L with a reducing sugar (RS) content of 12,600–19,960 mg/L. Due to the lack of nitrogen and phosphorus sources, the modified PYM medium without maltose was mixed with reword diluent beer as simulated BW."
4,Experimental setup,"2.3 Experimental setup In order to determine the optimal H2 production conditions with BW, batch experiments were performed with an initial RS concentration of 900–5360 mg/L (7143–42504 mg/L COD and initial beer dilution of 5–30%) and pH 6.0–8.0. All batch tests were performed in 100-mL anaerobic bottles with 50 mL simulated BW and 2 mL logarithmic growth seed inoculation. Bottles were shook at 120 rpm and 35 °C for 48 h. The semi-continuous tests were also performed in 100-mL bottles. The operation was achieved by discharging 60% volume of fermented broth supernatant after a 30 min precipitation, followed by an equivalent recharge with anaerobic fresh medium using a syringe. A 24 h pre-culture was performed with the optimized simulated BW before varying HRT. The FIT was set up as 12, 16, 24, 28 and 32 h (corresponding to the HRT of 20, 27, 40, 47 and 53 h) to study their effects on H2 production in semi-continuous fermentation. The gas production, H2 contents, pH, RS and cell biomass were determined at every feeding time."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The measurement of COD was performed according to the standard method (American Public Health Association, 1998). The dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method was employed to identify the total RS concentration (Miller, 1959). Biomass was measured as dry cell weight (DCW) according to the previous description (Ren et al., 2009). Bio-gas production and H2 content were measured and determined as our previously described by a gas chromatography of Agilent 7890A (USA) (Qi et al., 2019). The pH was determined with a S220 pH meter (Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effects of BW dilution,"3.1 Effects of BW dilution Generally, negative effects of excessive substrate and high content of alcohol in BW on the growth of microbes were always obtained (Bowles and Ellefson, 1985). Therefore, in order to obtain the optimal organic loading of BW for hydrogen production, the beer was diluted in 5–30% corresponding to the COD from 7143 to 42504 mg/L. Growth and H2 production by strain NH-02 were observed at BW dilution of 5%–30% and RS concentration of 900–5360 mg/L with an optimal dilution of 15% (21,173 mg/L COD) (Fig. 1 ). With the BW concentration increasing, the consumption of RS significantly reduced from 84.0% to 24.3%, and the DCW increased from 0.53 to 2.00 g/L. The end-point pH decreased from 6.4 to 4.9 when dilution reached 20%, and did not further change. With the BW concentration increasing from 5% to 15%, both of the cumulative H2 production and yield significantly increased from 105.1 to 479.3 mL/L and 1.12 to 1.89 mol-H2/mol-RS, respectively, then decreased gradually to 266.2 mL/L and 1.64 mol-H2/mol-RS. The H2 production and yield at 5% dilution of BW were only 21.9% and 59.3% of the maximum at 15% dilution of BW. The trends of H2 production rate (HPR) and content were different from that of H2 production and yield, whose peak of 2.48 mol-H2/mol-RS/g-DCW and 46.1% were obtained at 10% of BW, and then decreased. When the organic loading was low, the biomass, H2 production and yield significantly increased with the substrate concentration increasing. However, as the BW content continually increasing (>15%), the DCW did not change, and the end-point pH remained around pH 4.9. Although the H2 yield decreased, the downward trends were not as obvious as the RS consumption. The RS consumption decreased from 84.0% to 24.8% at 5%–30% of BW, and the descent trend was more significant at 20–30% of BW (27,755 to 42,504 mg/L COD) than other sections. The experimental results indicated that sufficient substrates could lead to the stimulation of cell growth, which resulted in a rapid production of volatile acids and a significant pH decrease. Excessive low pH and unsuitable content of ethanol in the BW had negative effects and inhibition on cell growth and H2 production. Considering the energy recovery efficiency and economic rationality, the optimal organic loading of BW at 21,173 mg/L COD (2670 mg/L RS) was determined for the following fermentation with strain NH-02."
8,Effect of initial pH,"3.2 Effect of initial pH As one of the dominant environmental factors, pH is closely related to the growth and energy metabolism of microorganisms. Therefore, a suitable pH condition could promote the bio-H2 production in not only batch cultures but also continuous cultures. Under the optimal BW dilution of 15% ( 2670 mg/L RS), the DCW and H2 production by strain NH-02 was observed differently with initial pH between 6.0 and 8.0 (Fig. 2 ). When the initial pH increased from 6.0 to 7.0, both of the H2 production and yield increased from 224.5 mL/L and 1.31 mol-H2/mol-RS to the maximum of 484.5 mL/L and 1.88 mol-H2/mol-RS, respectively, and then decreased gradually with pH further increasing. The RS consumption had a similar trend to the H2 yield, whose maximum of 77.4% was also obtained at initial pH 7.0. The DCW increased from 0.50 to the peak of 1.08 g/L with the initial pH increased from pH 6.0 to 7.5, and then decreased gradually to 1.08 g/L when further increasing to pH 8.0. The HPR decreased from 2.31 to 1.09 mol-H2/mol-RS/g-DCW with initial pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0. The maximum H2 production and yield of 484.5 mL/L and 1.88 mol-H2/mol-RS were obtained with initial pH 7.0. Although the DCW was stimulated by initial pH increasing, and reached the peak of 1.08 g/L at initial pH 7.5, the H2 generation was significantly affected, and led to the decrease of HPR. Similar results were obtained in previous studies that cell growth and H2 yield efficient were sensitive to initial pH (Li et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2011). Low pH condition usually results in lower level of ATP in cells and inhibits the bacterial growth (Bowles and Ellefson, 1985; Ferchichi et al., 2005). Initial pH 7.0 was suitable for strain NH-02 in the fermentative H2 production from BW."
9,Semi-continuous fermentative H2 production from BW,"3.3 Semi-continuous fermentative H2 production from BW H2 production with different FIT, which changed from 12 to 32 h (HRT at 20–53 h), was investigated in semi-continuous fermentation. The cumulative H2 production with different HRT steadily increased at different growth rates as shown in Fig. 3 . A longer HRT was not beneficial to the cumulative H2 production that with the HRT shortening from 53 to 20 h, the growth rate significantly stimulated. The maximum cumulative H2 production of 254.7 mL was obtained in the test group of HRT at 20 h (FIT at 12 h) after a 120 h fermentation. The prolongation of HRT was beneficial to the RS conversion. The RS consumptions at HRT shorter than 40 h were stable with slight fluctuation after the 3rd measurement, although increasing trends were observed in the group of HRT at 47 or 53 h. Due to a short FIT and rapid substrate replacement, the RS could not be completely consumed, and the lowest consumption was observed with HRT at 20 h. Similarly, due to the FIT and fresh medium replacement frequency, the endpoint pH of each test group fluctuated significantly after the pre-culture stage, but eventually remained at pH 5.2 ± 0.1. The results indicated that a shorter HRT was beneficial to the BW fermentation, but led a substrate waste, although a higher H2 accumulation was obtained. The cumulative DCW was slightly affected by HRT changes and fluctuated around 1.2 g/L (Fig. 4 ). The maximum of 1.24 g/L was observed with HRT at 47 h. However, the cumulative substrate consumption decreased step by step from 505.99 to 241.45 mg-RS with the HRT prolonging of from 20 to 53 h (Fig. 4). The cumulative H2 yield and HPR enhanced by 26.9% and 25.8%, respectively. Although the DCW increased by 5%, the H2 accumulation decreased steadily, which was suggested due to the RS remaining or other liquid byproducts in BW that inhibited the metabolic flux and reduced the H2 generation pathway flux. These results indicated that an appropriate HRT prolongation could lead to better substrate consumption in BW and reduce of the inhibition by liquid products accumulation."
10,A comprehensive comparison of H2 production from BW,"Bio-H2 yields from brewery wastewater with different inoculums in previous studies were shown in Table 1 . These processes were commonly carried out under the mesophilic conditions with the working temperature at 35–37 °C and mesophilic H2 production functional microorganisms. The continuous flow fermentations were usually performed and kept at pH 5.5–6.0 for more H2 yields. In order to make a more comprehensive comparison, units of the H2 yield were unified as mol-H2/mol-hexose. The H2 yield significantly increased with the COD concentration increasing at a range of 2552–49525 mg/L, except the result described in Choiron et al. (2020). The reason for the specific result was that the component in the substrate of sake brewery waste was different from BW in other studies. H2 yields from BW with activated sludge as mixed inoculum, which was collected from anaerobic wastewater treatment reactor or plant, were commonly higher than that of with pure-culture inoculum. A maximum H2 yield of 3.28 ± 0.04 mol-H2/mol-hexose from BW was obtained a bench-scale UASB with activated sludge as inoculum under the condition of 37 ± 2 °C, pH 5.7 and initial COD 49525 mg/L, whose COD was the highest in the Table 1 (Xu et al., 2019). However, the heat pretreatment to the activated sludge ranging from 100 to 150 °C for 10–90 min was an unavoidable step before the inoculation, which could suppress the methanogenic bacteria and enrich the H2-producing bacteria (Xu et al., 2019; Choiron et al., 2020). In order to achieve a higher bio-H2 yield and recovery, a two-stage fermentation process, combining with fermentative and bio-electrochemical methods, was also tried to be applied in the BW treatment (Golub et al., 2014). The organic acids produced in anaerobic fermentation process were represented as substrate for exo-electrogenic microorganisms in the following bio-electrochemical fuel cell, and a 2–4 folds higher H2 yield was obtained (Golub et al., 2014). Although studies on pure-culture fermentation were less than that of mix-culture, efficient strains could be applied as bio-augmentation inoculates in bio-H2 production processes. Strain Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from aviary litter, was found be capable to generate H2 rich biogas (30–40%) from BW both in small scales and continues flow of mechanically-stirred anaerobic reactor (AnBBR) (Estevam et al., 2018). However, the optimal H2 fermentation conditions for strain K. pneumoniae were not obtained in the study. In order to achieve a more efficient H2 recovery from BW, banana peel as co-substrate was attempted in the batch photo-fermentation by strain Rhodobacter sphaeroides DSM 158. A maximum H2 yield of 0.83 mol-H2/mol-hexose was obtained as 2.7-folds higher of that from the raw BW (Al-Mohammedawi et al., 2019). The residual organic matters in brewery wastewater can be used as good substrates by H2 producing bacteria, which were converted into H2 efficiently with appropriate concentration and condition. Basing on the previous experimental results, BW with COD higher than 3000 mg/L was found more suitable for fermentative H2 production by activated sludge, while BW with lower COD suited for pure-culture strain. Compared with pure-culture, activated sludge was more suitable for fermentative treatment of BW under acidic conditions. In the present study, C. butyricum NH-02, as a maltose-preferring bio-H2 producer, showed an excellent efficient of H2 recovery (5.21 mol-H2/mol-hexose) from stimulated BW, which was almost 5 folds higher than the other pure-cultured strains. Therefore, in the future, further studies on H2 production from actual BW should be carried out with C. butyricum NH-02 as pure-producer or bioaugmentation strain to explore its potential and capacity in the actual wastewater."
11,Conclusions,"Organic wastewater is attractive feedstock for fermentation and bioenergy recovery. This study demonstrated the feasibility of H2 production from brewery wastewater by a maltose-preferring producer of Clostridium butyricum NH-02. It presented an excellent performance in H2 production from simulated BW in both batch and semi-continuous fermentation. A maximum yield of 5.21 mol-H2/mol-RS was obtained in semi-continuous fermentation with the optimal organic loading of 21,173 mg/L COD (2670 mg/L reducing sugar) and HRT of 47 h. Appropriate HRT prolongation could not only lead to better BW conversion and treatment, but also be beneficial to the accumulative bio-H2 recovery."
