0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas (called hydrogen here for simplicity) has been envisaged as the clean and renewable fuel for future. Hydrogen can be produced by a number of processes, such as water electrolysis, steam reforming, coal gasification, and biological processes (Azwar et al., 2014). Among these technologies, biological conversion of renewable resources (e.g., organic wastes) to hydrogen has received a considerable attention in recent years, as sustainability, energy security, and climate change become important issues to be addressed. There are four technologies available for biological hydrogen production: photosynthetic biohydrogen, photo fermentation, dark fermentation, and microbial electrochemical cells (MECs) (Lee et al., 2010; Azwar et al., 2014). Dark bio-hydrogen fermentation has higher H2 production rate and adaptability to versatile organic substrates, as compared to other biohydrogen technologies (Lee et al., 2010; Rollin et al., 2015). One challenge, however, is low hydrogen yield in dark fermentation. Improving hydrogen yield over 4molH2/molglucose can make hydrogen economy viable (Rollin et al., 2015). Hydrogen yield depends on the fermentation pathway and end-products (Hafez et al., 2010; Elbeshbishy et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2009a). When acetic acid is the sole end-product, a theoretical maximum of 4molH2/molglucose is obtained: (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 When butyrate is exclusively generated, a theoretical maximum of 2molH2/molglucose is produced: (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + 2 CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 Theoretically, complete oxidation of glucose to hydrogen and carbon dioxide yields a maximum of 12molH2/molglucose which is thermodynamically unfavourable (Eq. (3)): (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 6 CO 2 + 12 H 2 Δ G ° = + 3.2 kJ The complete bio-conversion of glucose fermentation to 12mol hydrogen has not been discovered yet. Hence, the maximum biohydrogen yield is considered 4molH2/molglucose when acetic acid is the sole end-product. Several studies using hyperthermophilic microorganisms that generate energy via hydrogen production reported hydrogen yield close to the maximum (Kengen and Stams, 1994; Van Niel et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2011). In comparison, the hydrogen yield in mixed-culture dark fermentation is half of the maximum hydrogen yield or below the half (Lee et al., 2010; Hafez et al., 2010; Elbeshbishy et al., 2011; Dhar et al., 2012). Most of microorganisms cannot generate energy via proton reduction to H2, but balance intracellular reducing power. Acetate or butyrate production pathway yields ATP in fermentation. Therefore, microorganisms tend to distribute substrate electrons into end products for balancing the requirements to ATP and the reducing power during fermentation (Lee et al., 2008, 2009a). This principle explains why mixed-culture dark fermentation typically shows a combination of acetic acid, butyric acid, and hydrogen as main end products, which mainly limits hydrogen yield in dark fermentation. Small hydrogen yield significantly restricts the application of dark fermentation on one hand. On the other hand, the accumulation of simple acids in dark fermentation needs post-treatment for protection of water contamination. Post-treatment biohydrogen processes are ideal for addressing the two main challenges of dark fermentative biohydrogen, such as photo-fermentation or microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). MECs have advantages over photo-fermentation as post-treatment biohydrogen in that MEC performance is independent of weather conditions. In addition, dark fermentation well complements MECs because fermentation efficiently breaks down complex forms of organic compounds into simple acids that anode-respiring bacteria (ARB) can utilize through syntrophic interactions for current generation in MECs; ARB are very poor at utilizing complex organics as electron donor in microbial fuel cells or MECs (Li et al., 2014; Dhar and Lee, 2014; Dhar et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2014). For instance, current density was as high as 10–25A/m2 in MECs fed with simple acids (Gao et al., 2014; Dhar et al., 2013). In comparison, current density is small at 0.18–2.5A/m2 in microbial fuel cells or MECs directly treating organic waste or wastewater (Li et al., 2014; Dhar and Lee, 2014). For these reasons, dark fermentative biohydrogen and MECs are well complementary each other. Several literature reported improvement of hydrogen yield in a combined process of dark fermentation and MECs using synthetic wastewater (Lu et al., 2009; Lalaurette et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2014). Lu et al. (2009) reported an overall hydrogen recovery of 96% of the maximum theoretical yield of 0.125gH2/gCOD. Lalaurette et al. (2009) showed an overall hydrogen yield of 9.95molH2/molglucose from cellobiose as feedstock. Wang et al. (2011) also reported 41% increase in overall hydrogen yield (9.1mmolH2/gCOD to 33.2mmolH2/gCOD) from cellulose. It is apparent to improve hydrogen yield from synthetic wastewater using the combined biohydrogen process, but not from complex organic waste and wastewater due to the decrease of hydrogen yield in MECs (Liu et al., 2012; Dhar et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014). Low hydrogen yield in MECs also indicates that the integrated biohydrogen needs another post-treatment to improve effluent water quality, which seems to attenuate the applicability of the combined biohydrogen. Liu et al. (2012) tested the integrated biohydrogen process using pre-treated waste activated sludge as feedstock (6457mgSCOD/L) and reported 10mmolH2/gVSS with 90% of acetate removal, but only 21–55% of n-butyrate removal; effluent COD concentration was high at 3228mg/L. Li et al. (2014) reported a hydrogen yield of 15mmolH2/g-corn stalk with 81–91% acetate removal. However, butyrate and propionate removals were as small as 4–16%, and effluent COD was as high as ∼4000mg/L. The literature clearly indicates that the low removal of butyrate or propionate mainly limits hydrogen yield and deteriorates effluent quality in MECs, although hydrogen production from butyrate or propionate was reported in MECs (Liu et al., 2012; Dhar et al., 2013). Moderate current density from propionate has been observed in MECs (Torres et al., 2007; Dhar et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2014). In comparison, current generation from butyrate is significantly limited (Torres et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2012; Miceli et al., 2014), although butyrate is one of the most significant electron sink in dark fermentative biohydrogen (Lee et al., 2008, 2009a; Hafez et al., 2010; Elbeshbishy et al., 2011; Dhar et al., 2012). Therefore, the success of the integrated biohydrogen process needs the proliferation of butyrate-utilizing ARB or the syntrophy between ARB and butyrate fermenters in biofilm anode. No studies demonstrate that ARB can directly utilize butyrate as electron donor, which means that ARB would need syntrophic partners for butyrate fermentation to acetate and hydrogen. Miceli et al. (2014) recently suggested that fermenters (e.g., Gammaproteobacteria and Clostridia) convert butyrate into acetate, and ARB oxidize the acetate for current generation in a microbial electrochemical cell. However, the literature did not discuss thermodynamics on butyrate fermentation, although butyrate fermentation to acetate and hydrogen is not thermodynamically favorable; the standard Gibbs free energy at pH 7 ( Δ G ° ′ ) for butyrate fermentation to acetate and hydrogen is +48.3kJ/molbutyrate (C4H7O2 − +2H2O→2CH3COO− +H+ +2H2); the information on propionate fermentation thermodynamics is also limited. Thermodynamic analysis on these fermentation reactions will help us to better understand performance of MECs using butyrate or propionate as primary electron donor and further improve hydrogen yield. In this study, the potential of hydrogen production from sugar beet juice was demonstrated using a two-stage bio-hydrogen production process of dark fermentation and an MEC. The goal of this study is fourfold. The first is to evaluate hydrogen yield in dark fermentation on the basis of COD balances. The second is to optimize operating conditions for dark fermentation to achieve the maximum hydrogen yield. The third is to analyze thermodynamics on propionate and butyrate fermentation in biofilm anode for current generation in the MEC. The final is to assess energy recovery from sugar beet juice with the combined biohydrogen process."
1,Methods,
2,Batch experiments for dark fermentation,"2.1 Batch experiments for dark fermentation Anaerobic digested sludge was collected from the primary anaerobic digester at St Mary’s wastewater treatment plant (St Mary’s, Ontario) and used as inoculum for dark fermentation batch tests using serum bottles (see Table 1 ). The sludge was preheated at 70°C for 30min before inoculation to inactivate or kill methanogens or other H2-consuming microorganisms. Substrate-to-biomass (S/X) ratio was changed from 1 to 8gCOD/gVSS, and initial pH was adjusted to 5.5±0.2 using 1N NaOH and HCl before the experiments. The required volumes of inoculum and sugar beet juice (substrate) were adjusted to meet the S/X ratios in a total liquid of 200mL in serum bottles. The headspace in serum bottles was flushed with nitrogen gas (99.9%) for 3min and the bottles were capped tightly with rubber stoppers. The bottles were then placed in an incubator (MaxQ 4000, Thermo Scientific, CA) shaken at 180rpm at a constant temperature of 37°C. Serum bottle tests were conducted in triplicate for each condition. Control test (lacking substrate) was carried out to account for hydrogen gas production solely from substrate (Lee et al., 2008, 2009a). The volume of biogas produced from the serum bottles in batch dark fermentation tests was measured with water displacement method. The volume of displaced water within the pre-calibrated cylinder represents the volume of biogas produced."
3,Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC),"2.2 Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) A dual chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) was used for generating hydrogen gas from supernatant of sugar beet juice after fermentation. High density carbon fibers (2293-A, 24A Carbon Fiber, Fibre Glast Development Corp., Ohio, USA) integrated with a stainless steel current collector was used for the anode in the MEC. Two chambers were separated by an anion exchange membrane (AMI-7001, Membranes International Inc., USA). Stainless steel mesh (Type 304, McMaster Carr, OH, USA) was used as the cathode where H2 is produced; the literature (An and Lee, 2013) provides details of the MEC configuration. The MEC was inoculated with the effluent from another MEC that had been operated with acetate medium in a year. The MEC was fed with acetate medium (25mM and 50mM phosphate buffer) at batch mode until steady-state peak current density reached at 10±2A/m2; coulombic efficiency was 95±10% for the steady state. The transfer of inoculum, acclimation of the MEC, and composition of acetate medium were described in the literature (Dhar et al., 2013). After the steady state the batch-mode MEC was run with dilute sugar beet juice after fermentation. The supernatant of fermented sugar beet juice (S/X=4) was diluted at 1:1 ratio with the anaerobic nutrient medium lacking acetate, and then the diluted supernatant was fed to the MEC; prior feeding to the MEC, the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH. The MEC was operated at 25°C in a temperature-controlled room, and mixed at 100rpm using a multi-position magnetic stirrer (Model 650, VWR International Inc., Canada). The anode potential was fixed at −0.4V vs. Ag/AgCl using a potentiostat (BioLogic, VSP, Gamble Technologies, Canada) during experiments. The current, H2 production, effluent SCOD, soluble carbohydrate and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were monitored with time. Accumulated coulombs and currents were recorded at every 60s using EC-Lab for windows v10.12 software in a personal computer connected with the potentiostat. A gas meter (Ritter®MilliGascounterstype MGC-1, Ritter®Apparatebau, Germany) was connected to gas outlet in the cathode chamber of the MEC to record the volume of hydrogen gas."
4,Calculation,"2.3 Calculation The following modified Gompertz model was used to describe the progression of cumulative bioH2 production in the batch tests (Lay et al., 1999): (4) H = P · exp - exp R m e P ( λ - t ) + 1 where H is the cumulative bioH2 production (mL), P is the maximum bioH2 production (mL), R m is the maximum bioH2 production rate (mL/h), λ is the lag phase time (h), t is the incubation time (h), and e =exp(1)=2.718. The cumulative bioH2 data were fitted with Gompertz equation using the Newton–Raphson method for non-linear numerical estimation. The Newton’s method was programmed using visual basic application language available in Excel 2003. The main advantage of the Gompertz model is to estimate bioH2 production rate. Coulombic efficiency (CE) was calculated using the following equation (Eq. (5)) (Lee et al., 2009b): (5) CE = e trans - / e donor - where e trans - is the electron equivalents converted from the electric current, and e donor - is the electron equivalents of the consumed organic electron-donor. Cathodic conversion efficiency (CCE) represents the H2 production efficiency from coulombs, and calculated using the following equation (Eq. (6)): (6) CCE = H 2 obs / coulombs cum where, H2obs is H2 volume measured in a given time (e − quiv), coulombscum is the cumulative coulombs transferred to the anode in a given time (e − quiv). Current density (A/m2) was calculated with Eq. (7): (7) Current density = I / A where, I is current (A) and A is the geometric surface area of the membrane (m2). The current density is reported based on membrane surface area, since MECs can be scaled up based on the membrane surface area when materials with high surface area is used as electrodes (An and Lee, 2013). The energy recovery in the MEC was calculated using Eq. (8) (Logan, 2008): (8) η = W H 2 / ( W in + W s ) where W H 2 is the energy content in the hydrogen production, W in is the electricity input and W s is the energy content in the substrate input, the energy content in the substrate was calculated based on the COD of the substrate and the heat of combustion."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Liquid samples were analyzed for total suspended solid (TSS), volatile suspended solid (VSS), and alkalinity using standard methods (APHA, 1998). Total and soluble chemical oxygen demand (TCOD, SCOD), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) were measured using HACH test kits (HACH Odyssey DR/2500). Carbohydrate was determined with the colorimetric method (Dubois et al., 1956) at a UV wavelength of 490nm using glucose as a standard. Soluble parameters were quantified after filtration with 0.45μm filter paper (RK-02915-14, Cole-Parmer, USA). Acetate, propionate, n-butyrate, n-valerate, iso-butyrate, and iso-valerate were quantified using a gas chromatography (GC) (HP 5890 Series II, country) equipped with a Nukol fused-silica capillary column and flame ionization detector (FID). Helium gas was used as a carrier gas. The initial temperature of the column was 110°C, increasing to 195°C at the rate of 8°C/min, and then held constant at the final temperature of 195°C for 9min. Injector and detector temperatures were 220°C and 280°C, respectively. Prior to GC-FID analyses, the liquid samples were acidified to pH ∼2 using 1N phosphoric acid, and then filtered using 0.2μm membrane filter (DISMIC-25 HP, Toyo Roshi Kaisha Ltd., Japan). All liquid samples were measured in triplicates. Gas composition was determined with a GC (Model 310, SRI Instruments, Torrance, CA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a molecular sieve column (Molesieve 5A, mesh 80/100, 6ft×1/8in.). The temperatures of the column and the TCD detector were 90 and 105°C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mL/min."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen gas production from dark fermentation of sugar beet juice,"3.1 Hydrogen gas production from dark fermentation of sugar beet juice Fig. 1 shows the cumulative bioH2 production from dark fermentation of sugar beet juice at different substrate to inoculum (S/X) ratios. As the S/X ratio increased from 1 to 4gCOD/gVSS, bioH2 production increased from 360mL to a maximum of 1230mL. Then, the bioH2 production decreased to 122 and 135mL at S/X ratio of 6 and 8gCOD/gVSS, respectively. Thus, S/X of 4 has been found optimum for bioH2 production from beet juice. This result suggests that an optimum initial S/X is important to improve bioH2 production possibly via activating germination and/or preventing re-sporulation of spore-forming bacteria in mixed culture. However, very high S/X would be unfavorable due to substrate inhibition that may occur in several ways, such as accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and high hydrogen partial pressure. These observed results are consistent with the literature reporting the decrease of bioH2 production to increasing S/X ratio above 4 (Nasr et al., 2011). Fig. 2 shows the fractions of all quantified electron sinks at different S/X ratios based on the end products, which includes the volatile fatty acids, alcohols, soluble carbohydrate, soluble proteins, biomass, and H2; half reactions refer to the literature (Lee et al., 2008). The methane was not detected in serum bottle tests, due to the low pH and the thermal pretreatment of the inoculum. As shown in Fig. 2, for S/X of 1gCOD/gVSS, the sum of e − equivalent in soluble end products, biomass, and H2 was equal to 91% of the e − equivalent in the initial TCOD. At S/X ratios of 2 and 4gCOD/gVSS, the sum of e − equivalent in the soluble end products, biomass, and H2 was 81% of the e − equivalent in the initial TCOD. At higher S/X ratios of 6 and 8gCOD/gVSS, the three main products (i.e., soluble end products, biomass, and H2) only accounted for 52–62% of the e − equivalent in the initial TCOD. Incomplete hydrolysis and fermentation of beet juice observed at these high S/X ratios explain the low e − balances (see Fig. S1). The fraction of H2 at S/X of 1gCOD/gVSS was 10% of the initial TCOD, and it increased to 13% at both S/X of 2 and 4gCOD/gVSS. The fraction of H2 decreased to 7% and 4% of the initial TCOD at S/X of 6 and 8, respectively. This result clearly indicates that most of substrate electrons end up with liquid electron sinks (e.g., VFAs) in dark fermentation, and thus post-treatment is required to improve H2 yield and stabilize VFAs simultaneously. Acetate and butyrate were the main end products at S/X of 1, 2, and 4gCOD/gVSS. The sum of acetate and butyrate accounted for 45–49% of the electrons in the initial TCOD. Ethanol was not detected at S/X ratios of 1, 2, and 4gCOD/gVSS but it became 3% of the initial TCOD at S/X ratios of 6 and 8gCOD/gVSS. Fig. 3 a shows the measured and the computed SCOD at the end of the experiments. The measured SCOD values were 6–12% higher than the computed values and that would indicate accumulation of soluble microbial products (Lee et al., 2008). Fig. 3b shows the bioH2 yields as molH2/molhexose, given that the mole carbohydrate was considered equivalent to mole hexose (i.e. 180g total carbohydrate was considered equivalent to one mole hexose). Half reactions were used to express H2 yield with COD fraction: 16gCOD/molH2. As depicted in Fig. 3b, the maximum bioH2 yield of 3.2molH2/molhexose (normalized based on the mol hexose added) was observed at both S/X of 2 and 4. This yield is equivalent to about 80% of the theoretical value of 4molH2/molhexose. This finding agrees with the 3molH2/molhexose reported by Panagiotopoulos et al. (2010) using sugar beets as substrate and pure cultures of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus as inoculum and at a temperature of 70°C; in comparison, the temperature was 37°C in our study, and mixed culture was used for dark fermentation. No studies have demonstrated the metabolic pathways of producing 3molH2/molhexose at mixed-culture, mesophilic conditions. The assumption that 180g total carbohydrate would be equivalent to one mole hexose seems to overestimate the H2 yield expressed as molH2/molhexose, since carbon reductance is not consistent throughout polymeric carbohydrates. The distribution of main fatty acids after dark fermentation was described in Fig. 4 a. The main fatty acids were acetic acid (32–55%), butyric acid (18–44%), and propionic acid (10–34%); fractions of each acid were calculated with the total COD of measured TVFAs. The highest TVFAs of about 14,000mgCOD/L was found at S/X of 4 followed by 12,000mgCOD/L at S/X of 6. The lowest TVFAs of about 7000mgCOD/L was observed at the lowest S/X ratio of 1. Eqs. (1) and (2) represent the two main pathways for bioH2 production in dark fermentation where glucose is converted to acetic acid and butyric acid, respectively (Angenent et al., 2004). Hence, the molar ratio of acetate to butyrate (HAc/HBu) would be useful for predicting H2 yield in dark fermentation. Fig. 4b shows the HAc/HBu ratio at different S/X ratios. High ratio of HAc/HBu (6.3 and 7.3) was associated with high bioH2 yield for the S/X ratios of 2 and 4. The HAc/HBu ratio was low at 2.3–3.9 when H2 yield was small to moderate (S/X ratios 1, 6, and 8). Table 2 summarizes the results of the kinetic analysis for dark fermentative biohydrogen using Eq. (4). The determination coefficient (R 2) of over 0.99 for all the regressions confirms the applicability of the modified Gompertz model. The highest bioH2 production rate of 84mL/h was observed at S/X of 4 where H2 yield was the highest. The bioH2 production rate was the lowest at 21mL/h for S/X of 1, while the lowest bioH2 yield was observed for S/X ratio of 8. These results indicate that H2 yield is not directly correlated to H2 production rate. Table 3 summarizes the COD mass balances for all serum bottle experiments, which shows a closure of 79–97%. Our study did not quantify which electron sinks accounted for missed electrons at high S/X ratios. However, COD balances were high at 87–97% at the highest H2 yield (S/X ratios of 2 and 4), which supports data reliability for biohydrogen yield in our study."
8,MEC performance,"3.2 MEC performance 3.2.1 Current density and hydrogen production Fig. 5 a shows the observed current density for the MEC operated in batch mode for 20days. After feeding the fermented sugar beet juice, the current density remained almost steady at 3.6A/m2 for 6days and then gradually decreased with time, probably due to substrate limitation. The current density at the end of the experiment decreased by 0.1A/m2. The average CE for overall operating period (20days) was 70±6%, which is close to or higher that CEs in literature (Hou et al., 2014; Parameswaran et al., 2010). This high CE supports that ARB were dominant in biofilm anode, as compared to fermenters and methanogens; methane was not detected in the anode chamber of the MEC during experiments, and hence the presence of methanogens can be ignored. Fig. 5a also shows the cumulative hydrogen production with time. The ultimate hydrogen production of 1090mL was achieved, which corresponds to 12% of the SCOD added. No methane was detected in the cathode, and the average CCE was 95±3%. This outcome shows that the current produced by ARB was mainly converted to H2 gas without any significant loss of electrons (see Fig. 5b). 3.2.2 Trends of VFAs and partial pressure of H2 for fermentation Acetate, propionate and butyrate were the three major VFAs in the fermentation of sugar beet juice; other VFAs (i.e., valerate, 160–500mg COD/L) were trivial (<5% of TVFAs). Fig. 6 a shows the distribution of three major VFAs during 20days batch operation of the MEC. Acetate concentration sharply decreased from 3500±280mg/L at the beginning to less than 5mg/L during the first 6days, when propionate and butyrate concentrations did not change significantly. Then, propionate decreased sharply from 450mg/L to less than 40mg/L from day 6 to day 14. Butyrate-utilization rate was relatively slower than propionate, but butyrate concentration decreased from 620mg/L to about 300mg/L at the end of MEC operation. ARB was acclimated with acetate medium for the MEC, and thus high affinity of ARB for acetate over propionate and butyrate is reasonable. No studies have demonstrated that ARB directly utilize propionate and butyrate as electron donor for current generation in MECs. In comparison, several literature suggested that propionate and butyrate are fermented to acetate and H2, and after that ARB utilize acetate for current generation (Parameswaran et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2009b; Dhar et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2014). ARB are able to utilize H2 as electron donor (Lee et al., 2009b). However, no publications have clearly evidenced ARB’s oxidation of the H2 produced from butyrate or propionate fermentation in mixed-culture biofilm anode using the simple acid as primary electron donor. Alternatively, an indirect H2 oxidation process by ARB through homoacetogenesis (H2 +CO2 →CH3COOH→current) was suggested (Parameswaran et al., 2009; Dhar et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2014). Parameswaran et al. (2009) confirmed this alternative pathway by identifying homoacetogens with 16S rRNA gene in a mixed-culture MEC. To confirm H2 consumption reactions in biofilm anode, dissolved H2 concentration was monitored using a microsensor multimeter equipped with H2-microelectrode (Unisense A/S, Denmark) in an anode chamber of another MEC fed with mixture of propionate, butyrate, and acetate mimicking fermented beet juice. However, no dissolved H2 concentration was found in the anode chamber; H2 detection limit of the microsensor is as low as 1μM. This result supports that the H2 produced from butyrate or propionate fermentation is immediately consumed by H2-oxidizing microorganisms (e.g., homoacetogens) within MEC fed with fermentation effluent (mixture of acetate, butyrate and propionate) (Dhar et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2014). A theoretical balance on coulombs accumulated from 6 to 20days suggest that 83% of the total coulombs originated from the microbial oxidation of the acetate and the H2 produced via propionate and butyrate fermentation, and residual acetate from beet juice fermentation; in comparison, unknown electron donor accounted for 17% of the total coulombs. Fig. S2 shows the distribution of accumulated coulombs from different electron donors. Although our study did not reveal which H2-consuming reactions consumed the H2, the removals of propionate and butyrate, and current generation in the MEC imply the fermentation of the simple acids to acetate and H2 would occur in syntrophy with scavengers of acetate and H2. Propionate and butyrate are fermented to acetate and H2, as described in Eqs. (9) and (10): (9) C 3 H 5 O 2 - + 3 H 2 O → CH 3 COO - + HCO 3 - + H + + 3 H 2 Δ G ° ′ = + 76.1 kJ / mol propionate (10) C 4 H 7 O 2 - + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COO - + H + + 2 H 2 Δ G ° ′ = + 48.3 kJ / mol butyrate Based on the Δ G ° ′ values, propionate and butyrate fermentation to acetate and hydrogen gas can be only thermodynamically favorable when the term of constituent concentration (RT×ln Q) becomes significant in Gibbs free energy. The concentrations of acetate and H2, the main products of the fermentation of propionate and butyrate, should be low enough to drive the fermentation reactions thermodynamically. The acetate oxidation by ARB apparently kept acetate concentration low at 3mg/L in the anode chamber. Partial pressure of H2, another thermodynamic bottle to the fermentation reactions, should be also kept low in the anode, regardless of H2-consuming reactions. Using measured concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and pH, the partial pressure of the hydrogen gas (P H2) that allows the fermentation reactions to proceed was computed (see Supplemental material for details); it is assumed that the concentration of bicarbonate was 10mM for the computations. Fig. 6 shows the trends of P H2 for propionate and butyrate fermentations in the MEC. The P H2 required for the butyrate fermentation ranged from 0.001 to 0.077atm; the P H2 tended to increase with time because acetate concentration decreased with time. In comparison, the P H2 required for propionate fermentation was consistently low at 8×10−5 atm; the highest P H2 was only 0.0004atm for propionate fermentation. The higher P H2 for butyrate fermentation than that for propionate fermentation implies that butyrate fermentation to acetate and H2 can readily occur, as compared to propionate fermentation. Interestingly, this thermodynamic interpretation somewhat contradicts propionate removal faster and higher than butyrate in the MEC. Propionate was rapidly consumed (90% removal), while butyrate removal was relatively slow (50% removal), as shown in Fig. 6. Other literature also reported the same trend to our result (Liu et al., 2012; Dhar and Lee, 2014; Gao et al., 2014). Thus, it is expected that other parameters seem to limit butyrate fermentation in the anode, such as energy investment. There is small or negligible energy conservation in acetate fermentation to propionate (Dimroth and Schink, 1998; Seeliger et al., 2002), which indicates that propionate fermentation to acetate and H2 would not need large energy investment. In contrast, acetate fermentation to butyrate conserves 1molATP/molbutyrate, and hence fermenters would scarify significant energy for the reverse fermentation pathway of butyrate to acetate and H2. 3.2.3 Overall hydrogen yield and energy recovery The hydrogen production from dark fermentation and the MEC was 1226mL (13% of the TCODadded) and 1088mL (12% of the TCODadded), respectively. The overall hydrogen production from the integrated biohydrogen process was 2314mL, which corresponds to 25% of the initial TCODadded and 6molH2/molhexoseadded. This hydrogen yield is the highest from sugar beet juice wastewater to our knowledge. The energy recovery in dark fermentation process was calculated as the ratio of the energy content in the hydrogen produced (recovered) to the energy content in the total carbohydrate content of the substrate. The energy recovery in the MEC was calculated based on the energy content in the hydrogen produced in the MEC (recovered) to the sum of energy content in the substrate and electricity input (see Eq. (8)). Considering the heat combustion of 285.83kJ/mol for hydrogen and 14.995kJ/gCOD, the efficiencies of energy recovery in dark fermentation and the MEC were 35% and 34%, respectively. Overall energy recovery achieved in the integrated biohydrogen process was 57%; see Supplemental material for detailed calculations. The biohydrogen process combining dark fermentation with MECs clearly shows energy benefit from beet-juice wastewater treatment. However, butyrate fermentation rate should be improved further to engineer the integrated biohydrogen process."
9,Conclusions,"The maximum H2 yield was 13% of TCOD at S/X ratios of 2 and 4gCOD/gVSS in dark fermentation using sugar beet juice wastewater as substrate, and the MEC further produced H2 up to 12% of TCOD. Thus, the overall H2 yield was 25% of TCOD of sugar beet juice using the integrated biohydrogen process. P H2 should be low at 8×10−5–1×10−3 atm in the anode chamber for ARB and syntrophic fermenters to utilize propionate and butyrate as electron donor in the MEC. More rapid utilization rate of butyrate is essential for engineering the integrated biohydrogen."
