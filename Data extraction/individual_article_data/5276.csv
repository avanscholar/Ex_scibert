0,Introduction,"Freshwater resources are finite in our planet, due to amplifying the industrial activities and urbanization is responsible for the discharge of large number of dyes, pollutants, organic pollutants and heavy metal ions in the natural water bodies (Kumari et al., 2016). Textile industries use 80–100 m3 of water then releases polluted water into the natural environment (Fu et al., 2011). Azo dyes are the main pollutants produced in paramount industries, such as printing, cosmetic manufacturing, food colourants and textiles. Bioaccumulation of azo dyes is a serious problem because of the complex structure and xenophobic properties. The contaminated water discharged from industries contains non-biodegradable, highly toxic carcinogenic Congo red (CR) dye. To fulfill water scarcity it is utmost demand to develop novel adsorbents to overcome this drastic nuisance. Industrial water contaminated with dyes is commonly treated by conventional techniques like coagulation (Zhou et al., 2018), photocatalysis (Li et al., 2019;Bhat et al., 2020;Guo et al., 2019) and adsorption (Vaghela et al., 2005). Adsorption method is significant because it is very cheap, availability of different adsorbents, simple, high efficiency, and ease of operation (Garg et al., 2004). Polymeric materials and hybrid polymers from last few decades diverted the attention of scientists because of the diversified applications (Meftah et al., 2014). Polymer materials have been used in health monitoring, removal of heavy metals, organic dyes, controlled drug release and anti-microbial applications. As the overall polymers, most of them have very negligible antibacterial action, and they have to be modified to procure structure and properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) derived composite with coveted properties and applications (Azizi et al., 2014). PVA is a green material due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility (DeMerlis and Schoneker, 2003), nontoxicity (Gopishetty et al., 2012) and exhibits swelling in water. But some limitations associated with PVA that diminishes stability in water due to plasticizing action of water (Guzman-Puyol et al., 2015), low strength and thermal instability along with their negligible antibacterial activity (Wang and Liu, 2013). These drawbacks overcome by their modification with different polymers and nanoparticles to prepare blends, composites and nanocomposites. The physical and antibacterial properties of PVA improved by the quaternized cellulose reinforcement (Hu and Wang, 2016a, 2016b). The membrane permeance and selectivity properties of PVA enhanced by bentonite clay nanoparticles (Jose et al., 2014). The mechanical properties of PVA enhanced by blended with MWCNT (Bin et al., 2006) and the blending of PVA with chitosan increases the tensile strength in PVA/chitosan blend (Koosha and Mirzadeh, 2015). Thermal stability of PVA has been improved after blended with nanocrystalline cellulose (Voronova et al., 2015) and starch increases the water uptake potential of PVA (Kotoky and Dolui, 2004). The modified polysaccharides have been used as an adsorbent to remove toxic compounds from waste water (Sahraei et al., 2017). Electronic equipment’s produce waste like resins, fire retardants, heavy metals and inorganic nonmetals materials which directly increase the environment pollution (Qi et al., 2019). The brominated fire retardants have shown the potential environmental hazards. So, the debromination of printed circuit boards at low temperature near critical aqueous ammonia (Xiu et al., 2019).The degradation of Polybrominated dipheny ethers Xiu et al., 2019) and critical water system has been used for the decomposition and debromination generated from waste print circuit boards (Xiu et al., 2018). Modified tragacanth/graphene oxide composite is used for the adsorption of heavy metals (Crini, 2005). Polypyrrole based composites used as adsorption beads to remove organic dyes from aqueous solution (Zhang et al., 2010) and PVA/chitosan composites are also used as removal of heavy metal and dye adsorption from aqueous solution (Sekhavat Pour and Ghaemy, 2015). Composite films developed by the blending of PVA with different biodegradable and non-biodegradable polymer improves dye adsorption (Li et al., 2012). The hydrogels prepared by blending of PVA with polysaccharides used for wound dressings (Kamoun et al., 2015) and PVA/polymethyl methacrylate blend used for healing chronic wounds (Hsieh et al., 2017). Enhancement of antibacterial activity of PVA after blended with quaternized cellulose and Melamine formaldehyde (MF) (Hu and Wang, 2016a, 2016b; Kakkar et al., 2014). MF resin usually increases stability and compatibility in PVA but decreases the transparency of PVA as the MF concentration increases (Yu et al., 2014). Addition of MF resin in different polymers and nanoparticles improves structure and properties (Wohnsiedler, H. P 1953) temperature sensing and intracellular thermometry (Yan et al., 2015), adsorption of metal ions (Wu et al., 2016) and bioconjugation and modification (Baraka et al., 2007). The thermal stability and resistance against hydrolysis improved by the MF resin in PVA (Xu et al., 2014) and (Kandelbauer et al., 2009). MF resin effect the properties of polymers such as thermal stability, stiffness, hardness, resistances in abrasion, surface smoothness and flame retardant which diverted the attention of industrialists (Wang, 2015). MF based composites were used as coatings, decorative laminates and wood adhesive (Park and Jeong, 2010;Raval et al., 2010). The present work is purposeful to overcome the obstacles of water instability of Pure PVA and for the first time to investigate physical properties, swelling properties, chemical stability and biodegradation PVA/MF composite films. The aim of the work is the development of moisture resistant composite films, were synthesized by the reaction between PVA and optimized MF. In the present work optimization of MF synthesis at different time intervals with a molar ratio of 1:3 was carried out. The PVA and PVA/MF composite films were characterized by FTIR for the determination for chemical interaction and functional groups; XRD is used to determine crystal structures and amorphous nature of materials, the contact angle for moisture resistance and SEM technique for surface morphology of films. The objective of the work is (i) determination of swelling studies, chemical stability and biodegradation of composite films, (ii) evaluation of composite films as an adsorbent for CR dye adsorption from aqueous solution, assessment of experimental conditions such as the effect of contact time, pH of solution and effect of CR dye’s concentration, and (iii) antimicrobial activity against gram-positive Escherichia coli (E. coli) 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) 700603, and gram-negative Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) 4736 and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) 5902 bacterial strains."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (Molecular weight: 1, 15,000, LR grade) and Formaldehyde (37% w/v, LR grade) were purchased from Merck, India. NaOH pellets and Melamine powder were also purchased Merck. All the solutions were made by using double distilled water. Congo red (CR) dye, Mueller-Hinton agar, well plates and petri dish plate were purchased from JKM LABTEK laboratories, New Delhi. For antibacterial testing four bacterial strains namely E. coli 25922, K. pneumoniae 700603, B. subtilis 4736 and S. aureus 5902 were used in this study obtained from the Department of Biosciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, and stored at 4 °C before use."
3,Synthesis of melamine formaldehyde (MF),"2.2 Synthesis of melamine formaldehyde (MF) MF resin was prepared by the condensation reaction between Melamine and Formaldehyde by a reported method with some modification (Likozar et al., 2012). The resin synthesized by 1:3 M ratios of Melamine and formaldehyde under 2N NaOH as a catalyst. The pH of formaldehyde was brought up to 8–9 by adding a few drops of NaOH base in a double-necked flask. Round bottom flask with 15 mL of the formaldehyde was put on a magnetic stirrer and 8 g of melamine powder slowly added under continuous stirring followed by the addition of 10 mL distilled water at 60 °C. The reaction mixture was heated on a magnetic stirrer with uninterrupted stirring till the temperature increased to about 85±5 °C. The process of refluxation and stirring at this temperature was continued up to a 1 h, a clear viscous solution was obtained. The viscosity of the reaction mixture increase and a colourless MF resin was obtained (Xu et al., 2016) (Fig. 1 , Step I). After every 10 min, the water tolerance of MF resin was carried out until the water tolerance at 30 °C dropped to 1:4. The MF resin was allowed to cool at 25 °C and the final properties like viscosity and water tolerance were standardized (Viscosity at 32 °C: 30–40 s, water tolerance: 1:2–1:4 and gel time at 150 °C: 210–240 s). The shelf life MF resin was increased by dissolving it in the methanol."
4,Preparation of PVA/MF composite films,"2.3 Preparation of PVA/MF composite films For the preparation of PVA/MF composite, firstly PVA stock solution was prepared. To prepare the stock solution 10% PVA was added to double distilled water and the solution was heated on a magnetic stirrer at 90 °C for 2 h. The prepared 20 mL of PVA solutions were blended with freshly prepared MF resin in various ratios (MF 13%, 23%, 33% and 43%) by using a magnetic stirrer while heating at about 90 °C up to 1 h and the colour of reaction mixture appeared white that confirms the formation of PVA/MF composite (Fig. 1 step III) (Yu et al., 2014). The sample designation and preparation of PVA/MF composite films are given in Table 1 ."
5,Preparation of film,2.4 Preparation of film To obtain best and air bubble free thin uniform freestanding films the desired amount of PVA solution and PVA/MF composite poured on a rectangular Teflon sheet. The samples were uninterrupted as long as dried at a moderate temperature (28oC–35 °C) for 12 h. After drying the films were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 30 min then packed in zip lock bags.
6,Characterization,"The crosslinking between PVA and MF composite was analyzed by various analytical and instrumental measurements. Optimization of MF by FTIR in range of 650–3500 cm−1 region was taken on a PerkinElmer 1750 FT-IR spectrophotometer. The ATR-FTIR spectra of the PVA and PVA-MF composite in range of 600–3500 cm−1 region were taken on a PerkinElmer 1750 FT-IR spectrophotometer. XRD studies have been carried out using Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffract meter with Ni-filtered Cu–Kα radiation (λ = 1.5416 Å). The morphology of the composite was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM model FEI Quanta 200 FIE 250 XMax 80) at SAIF research laboratory, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Thermal studies (TGA and DSC) of PVA and composite films were carried out (Metter Toledo AG analytical CH860, Schwerzenbach Switzerland) at NIT Srinagar, performed in a range of 25oC–850 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere 20 mL/min. The contact angle of water on the PVA film and PVA/MF composite films were determined with a drop system analysis (KRUSS BmbH Co., Germany) based on the sessile drop method at room temperature and 60% relative humidity. Average contacts of all samples were taken from at least two different points on the film surface."
7,Swelling studies,"3.1 Swelling studies The swelling studies and chemical stabilities of PVA film and PVA/MF composite films were carried out in 0.1 M solution of HCl, NaOH and distilled water at room temperature over a time of 960 min. The swelling percentage was calculated by the equation (3.1). 3.1 Swelling % = S w − S D S D × 100 Sw is the weight of a wet sample and SD is the weight of a dry sample."
8,Soil degradation test,"3.2 Soil degradation test Soil degradation test was determined in a natural environment. The weight and size of pure PVA and composite films are 0.013 g and 1.5 ×1.5 cm, buried 30 cm below the soil in Jamia Millia Islamia. The temperature of soil, pH and moisture air was measured as 18.2 °C, 7.6 and 52% respectively. After 30 days all samples were taken out washed properly so that attached soil will be washed away then dried at 40 °C for12 h. The soil degradation of all samples was calculated by weight loss. After the burial, weight loss was determined every weak. The average weight loss was calculated by equation (3.2). 3.2 Weight loss % = W i − W f W i × 100 Wi is an initial weight and Wf is the final weight of the film."
9,Adsorption experiment by using a batch method,"3.3 Adsorption experiment by using a batch method The adsorption of CR dye by PVA and PVA/MF composite films were determined by batch adsorption method. A standard solution of 500 mg/L CR dye was processed by dissolving powder CR dye in double distilled water. The CR dye solution was diluted to various concentrations of 50–200 mg/L. Before adsorption of PVA and PVA/MF composite films were dried in a vacuum desiccator. Experiments were carried in a series containing 50 ppm stock CR dye solution having 0.013 g adsorbents (S1–S5 films), the concentrations of dye (50,100,150, 200 mg/L), pH of solution (4,6,8,9 and 10) and agitation time of solution (10–60 min) at 30 °C. The pH of the solution was adjusted by 0.1M HCl and NaOH. In all three parameters, mixtures were shaken by thermostatic shaker at 250 rpm. The experiment was repeated in all three parameters, for justification of results. The per cent (%) removal of CR dye (mg L−1) by PVA and PVA/MF composite was calculated by using a mass balance relationship, which determines the amount CR dye adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent by equation (3.3). (3.3) Removel % = Co - Ce Co × 100 Where Co and Ce are initial and final CR dye concentration (mg L−1)."
10,In–vitro antibacterial activity,"3.4 In–vitro antibacterial activity Four bacteria strains: E. coli 25922, K. pneumoniae 700603, B. subtilis 4736 and S. aureus 5902 were selected for the antimicrobial experiment of PVA/MF composite. Bacterial cultures were prepared by growing pure colonies into Luria Broth (LB) and incubated at 37 °C at 120 rpm. Further, bacterial culture were spread on the entire surface of Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates and placed small-sized films of (S1) PVA, (S2–S5) PVA-MF composite. Finally all culture loaded MHA plates were incubated at 37 °C for overnight and after incubation, clear zone of inhibition (ZOI) was measured in millimeter (mm) scale. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of PVA/MF composite against above four bacterial strains was determined by broth micro dilution method. For this, different concentration of composites (3.12–1000 μg/mL) was prepared by two fold serial dilution and equal volume of bacterial culture was added into each well of 96-wells microliter plates. After overnight incubation the lowest concentration of composite showed no visible growth of bacteria was considered as MIC. Further, minimum lethal concentration (MLC) of PVA/MF composite against above bacterial strains was determined by the killing assay (Singh et al., 2013). In brief, bacterial cells were treated with different concentration of each composite (3.12–1000 μg/mL) and incubated at 37 °C for overnight. Treated culture was serially diluted up to 10−3 times followed by plating on Luria Agar (LA) plates. After overnight incubation the viable bacterial colony were counted and the rate of inhibition of treated bacteria as compared to untreated (control) was calculated by the equation (3.4). (3.4) Antibacterial rate % = N o − N 1 N o × 100 No and N1 are referred to as bacteria in the control culture plate and the experimental culture plates. The concentrations at which 50% of bacterial cells were killed were defined as MLC50."
11,Results and discussion,"The synthesis of MF resin occurs in two stages (Fig. 1). Methyloltion is first addition reaction of formaldehyde and melamine that can be carried out in a basic medium using few drops of 2N NaOH solution (Step I, Fig. 1). The condensation reaction is the second stage leading to the formation of ether linkage that can occur due to crosslinking in alkaline condition (Step II, Fig. 1). During synthesis 1:3 ratio of M: F was chosen (Merline et al., 2013). The viscosity of MF increases as the time increases during the reaction. So, the MF was optimized at different time intervals 5 min, 30 min, 1 h and after drying the sample. The structure of these MF resins was confirmed by taking their respective FTIR. The MF that synthesized in 1 h was selected out of the four due to more availability of hydroxyl groups which required for better crosslinking with PVA (Maitra and Kumar Shukla, 2014). Condensation reaction between PVA with different MF ratios 87:13 (S2), 77:23 (S3), 67:33 (S4) and 57:43 (S5) at 90 °C was carried out until the white colour appearance in the reaction mixtures (Fig. 1, Step III)."
12,Spectral analysis,"4.1 Spectral analysis 4.1.1 FTIR Optimization of MF was carried out by comparing FTIR spectra at different time intervals (5, 30, and 60 min) along with dried MF. Fig. 2 (a–d) shows FTIR spectra of MF at 5, 30, and 60 min and dried MF, respectively. The following characteristic peaks at 3405-3332 cm−1 (N–H and OH stretching), 2967-2973 cm−1 (C–H stretching), 1570-1572 cm−1(CN stretching), 1385-1396 cm−1 (C–N stretching), 1057-1064 cm−1 (C–O stretching), 1164 cm−1 (C–O–C), 996- 1005 cm−1(C–H rocking) and 812 cm−1 (triazine ring) were observed in each spectra. The absorbance at 3410 cm−1 is referred to O–H and N–H stretching vibrations in MF resin (Xu et al., 2016), but a less intense peak was observed and gradual shifting to 3406 cm−1, 3405 cm−1 and 3332 cm−1 after 30 min, 60 min and MF powder that confirms the N–H and O–H interaction, respectively. The strong peak at 1064 cm−1, 1064 cm−1 and 1057 cm−1 corresponds to C–O stretching vibration (Chen et al., 2015) shown in Fig. 2 (a, b, c) and the peak is shifted in a dried MF sample to 1164 cm−1 confirms the formation of C–O–C linking (Wu et al., 2008b). The peak at 1570 cm−1 observed in all four samples but peak intensity decreases from spectrum (a to d) [Fig. 2 (a - d)]. A strong peak observed at 812 cm−1 in all samples attributed to triazine ring of MF resin and the peak appeared intense in the case of MF powder (Wu et al., 2008a). The C–O–C crosslinking consumes the free hydroxyl group’s decreases the viscosity of MF. The average viscosity and the maximum available hydroxyl groups may be possessed by MF at 60 min are optimized for the PVA crosslinking. 4.1.2 ATR-FTIR of pure PVA and PVA/MF composite films Fig. 3 depicts the ATR-FTIR spectrum of S2–S5 composite films that compared with S1 films. The spectra of S1 shows characteristic peaks at 3274 cm−1 (OH stretching), 2926 cm−1 (asymmetric and symmetric CH2/CH3), 1423 cm−1 (C–H bending), 1258 cm−1 (C–O stretching), 1064 cm−1 (C–O–C) and 792 cm−1 CH2 bending. S2–S5 spectrum reveals the following characteristic peaks at 3294-3264 cm−1 (OH stretching), 2926-2919 cm−1 (asymmetric and symmetric CH2/CH3), 1555-1562 cm−1 (CN stretching), 1414-1424 cm−1 (C–H bending), 1323-1338 cm−1 (C–N stretching aryl), 1258- 1256 cm−1 (C–O–C), 1067-1076 cm-1 (C–O stretching) and 801-814 cm−1 triazine ring (Bhat et al., 2019b). By comparing the spectra of S2–S5 with S1, the main changes observed in the region of –OH, –CH along with some additional peaks. These peaks are observed at 1572-1552 cm−1, 1323-1338 cm−1 and 812-814 cm−1, respectively for CN stretching, C–N stretching and triazine ring that appears after the addition of MF in the PVA (Xu et al., 2016). A strong peak at 1258 cm−1 corresponds to C–O–C stretching (Razavi et al., 2011), but the peak intensity decrease due to electrostatic interaction within the polymer composites. The strong peak at 1034-1080 cm−1corresponds to C–O stretching, but the peak intensity decreases with the increase of MF ratio due to the consumption of O–H groups of PVA in S2–S5 (Hassiba et al., 2017). The strong peak at 813 cm−1 attributed to triazine of MF and the peak appeared broad and short in all composite films. The appearance of new peaks and diminishing of old peaks confirm the crosslinking of PVA/MF. The close examination of spectra reveals that the peak intensity of O–H and C–H, respectively at 3282 cm−1 and 2964 cm−1 (S1) decreases up to 3262 cm−1 and 2929 cm−1 (Ahad et al., 2012) along with broadening (Bhargav et al., 2009). These results correlated to that S2–S5 formed through chemical crosslinking between PVA and MF along with electrostatic interactions within polymer chains."
13,XRD,"4.2 XRD XRD is a technique used to determine the crystal structure, amorphous structure and phase analysis of composite films. Fig. 4 (a) shows 101, 209 and 111 crystalline reflections correspond to 2θ values of S1 film at 19.66°, 22° and 40.88° is characteristic of semi-crystalline nature. S1 shows one strong characteristic peak for the orthorhombic lattice (101) with unit cell parameters of a = 7.81 Å, b = 2.52 Å, c = 5.51 Å, β = 91.78 (Jiang et al., 2015). The crystalline nature of S1 is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding with the polymer molecular chains. The broad peak at 19.54° shows amorphous nature of MF resin [Fig. 4 (b)]. The peak intensity of 2θ value (19.85°) markedly decreases and the other two peaks of S1 disappeared in the case of S3 composite [Fig. 4 (c)] and relates to amorphous behavior. This can be due to by altering the hydrogen bonding of S1 by the addition of MF resin leads to decrease crystalline nature of PVA in PVA/MF composite [Fig. 4 (c)]. It is reported that the semi-crystalline nature of PVA decreases as the concentration of hydroxyl propyl cellulose (HPC) increases in the PVA/HPC composites (Guirguis and Moselhey, 2012). So, the phase morphology of S3 composite is governed by the compatibility of the semi-crystalline phase of PVA and amorphous phase of MF resin. The disappearance of PVA peaks by the addition of MF resin indicates the strong crosslinking in the polymer composite."
14,Contact angle,"4.3 Contact angle Contact angle measurements have been used to study the behaviour (hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) of synthesized composite films by a drop of liquid on the respective films. The contact angle below 90° and above 90° shows the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of materials respectively. The contact angle is an appropriate tool to study environmentally dependent change on the surface properties on PVA and blend films (Boudot et al., 2014). The contact angle of S2–S3 composites increases from (49-91°) as the concentration of MF increases (Fig. 5 ). Hydrophobic with contact angle 91° was observed after the addition of 43% of MF in PVA. The contact angle of PVA increases from 61 to 67° after blending with the vinyl acetate (Zuo et al., 2013). The crosslinking in S2–S5 films increases with MF due to the increases the hydroxyl groups of MF that reacted with PVA along with physical interactions. The chemical crosslinking and electrostatic interactions in the composite increases the hydrophobicity of S5 (Fig. 5)."
15,Swelling properties,"4.4 Swelling properties The swelling attitude of S1–S5 films was analyzed by placing in different conditions such as double distilled water, 0.1M solution of HCl and 0.1M NaOH solution. To determine the swelling behaviour of S1–S5 films were weighted before and after immersed in different solutions after specific time intervals. When the film samples (S1–S5) immersed in pure water the maximum osmotic pressure develops, so the maximum swelling of PVA films has been attained 998%, but swelling reduced due to chemical cross-linking with MF up to 300%. The swelling of composites films (S2–S5) is very sensitive to ionic solutions. The cation increase the swelling of films due to the effect of 0.1 M HCl solution. After the maximum swelling of films in 0.1 M HCl then the films (S1–S5) start degenerating after 10 min, but the stability increases from (S1–S5). When the films (S1–S5) immersed in the basic solution 0.1 M (NaOH) the osmotic pressure is much lower than the HCl solution. The maximum swelling of S1 film was observed 650% but the reduction in swelling up to 300% after blending with MF in S5 attained in a basic solution. The stability in all three conditions increases after addition of MF in PVA shown in Fig. 6 . The swelling behaviour of the composite reduction capability increases from S1–S5 due to crosslinking between PVA and MF resin by consuming hydroxyl groups present in both reactants (Paranhos et al., 2007). The strong crosslinking increases by the addition of MF in PVA is responsible for the enhancement of stability in the composite films. The swelling behaviour of PVA decreases up to 85% after blending with 5% Halloysite nanotubes was observed due to physical interaction between matrix and fillers (Khoo et al., 2013). It was observed that the hydrophobic properties of PVA increase by increasing wt. % of MF confirmed by the enhancement in contact angle from 49 to 91°. According to Fig. S1 swelling and chemical stability of films (S1-5) are very sensitive to the type and concentration of solutions. The composite films are more stable in NaOH solution and water but least stable in (0.1M) HCl solution."
16,Biodegrability test,"4.5 Biodegrability test Moisture provides favorable environment for microbial growth, the microorganisms in this type of environment are responsible for degrading polymer and polymer blends. The bio-degradation of S1–S5 films occur due to degradation of PVA by the enzymatic action of microorganisms present in soil (Ahmad et al., 2017). The degradation rate of the composite films (S2–S5) was more than S1 film after 30 days of soil burial. Fig. S2 shows the weight loss was low initial but increases with time. The bacteria responsible for bio-degradation of composite films (S2–S5) are Rhodococcus opacus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas putida. They mineralize atrazine ring to hydroxylatrazine, polar metabolites and CO2 in the contaminated soil (Mandelbaum et al., 1995). It was analyzed that after burying the composite films (S1–S5) in soil, the composite films became fragile and hard. The composite samples showed the highest weight loss due to enzymatic action, bacterial degradation and large pores within the cross-linked network. So, the concentration of MF affects the soil burial degradation."
17,"Film appearance, thickness and transparency of films","4.6 Film appearance, thickness and transparency of films The obtained S1 and S2–S5 composite films are homogeneous, flexible and clearly transparent but diminish the transparency on another side of the film appeared hazy when observed through the naked eye. Increasing the concentration of MF (13%, 23%, 33% and 43%) slowly decreases the light transmittance shown in Fig. S3 (S1–S5). The composite film became opaque and brittle at 43% MF obscuring the name underneath the film. The average thickness of composite films was found in a range of 120–200 μm was measured by the Elcometer instrument (Model 345 NT, 166 Elecometer Instrument, and Manchester. UK."
18,SEM-EDX,"4.7 SEM-EDX The apparent designs of the composite films were observed with the help of scanning electron microscopy. Fig. 6 (a - b) shows SEM images of S3 film at 2 μm and 20 μm magnifications. It reveals the rough and heterogeneous surface morphology of the composite film. The grooves and non-uniform pores were observed in and on the surface of polymer composite films. The surface morphology of composite shows good compatibility between PVA and MF. The surface of the film also showed cross-linked networks. This can be related to that the polymer composite is prior to chemical cross-linking and their chain network due to electrostatic interactions (Fathi et al., 2011). The EDX and elemental mapping analysis were further used to confirm the MF in PVA/MF composite as shown in Fig. 6(c–f). The elemental mapping of S3 composite showed specific location of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, which confirmed the presence of MF and PVA in composite film."
19,Thermal analysis,"4.8 Thermal analysis TGA of the S1–S5 films was to determine the thermal stability and weight (wt.) loss. Fig. 7 reveals the evaporation of water in S1 and the composites (S2–S5) starts from 80 to 230 °C with wt. loss of 8%, the second stage wt. loss (77%) at 230–410 °C and third wt. loss 92% at 410–500 °C is due to melting of PVA side chains (Pirzada et al., 2012). The TGA of S1 showed a constant value above 600 °C indicating that the film had been burnt completely. Thermal stability of the composites increases as the wt. % of MF increases (see Fig. 7). Fig. 7, the TGA of PVA/MF (S2–S5) composites showed three main weight loss stages. The first stage starts from 80 to 230 °C (6–13 wt. loss % evaporation of water and other moieties), second stages start from 230 to 410 °C (77-66 wt. loss % side chain decomposition of PVA and ammonia from MF) and the third stage starts from 410 to 500 °C (92-73 wt. loss % decomposition of the main chain of PVA and MF) produces volatile compounds like CO2, HCN and CO (Pirzada et al., 2012). It was observed that the composite films initial weight loss is 8–15% but weight loss above 350 °C is less than S1. The thermal stability of the composites increased due to the network structure, cross-linking between the PVA and MF resin, un-reacted hydroxyl groups leads to hydrogen bonding and the molecular chain rigidity. From the TGA results, it is clear that when MF concentration above 2% increases the weight loss decreases in the composites films. The degradation temperature of the composites films significantly enhanced as compared to S1 film as shown in Fig. 7."
20,Differential scanning calorimetry,"4.9 Differential scanning calorimetry DSC has been used to investigate thermal behaviour, glass transition temperature, Tg, crystallization temperature, Tc (exothermic) and the melting point, Tm (endothermic) of S1–S5. Tg of S1 film was observed at 66 °C but the Tg increased up to 67 °C, 74 °C, 78 °C, and 81 °C in composite films (S2–S5) respectively. DSC results revealed that the utilization of MF by PVA in the polymer composite films increases the crosslinking/branching that restricts the chain mobility, which leads to increases the Tg value from 66 to 81 °C shown in Fig. S4. The significant effect on Tg temperature is due to chain rigidity, molecular packing and electrostatic interaction polymers (Akram et al., 2008). DSC shows two endothermic peaks at 244 °C and 362 °C are corresponding to the melting of polymers and release of strain and disintegration of C–C linkage at 426 °C resulting in the decomposition of PVA. The drift in the thermogram of polymer composite films showed two endothermic peaks at 196 and 247 °C (S2) composite films. The S3 film shows two endothermic peaks at 200 °C and 264 °C whereas in S4 film two endothermic peaks observed at 197 °C, 267 °C. But in the case of S5 only one endothermic peak at 275 °C shown (Fig. S4). The first endotherm peaks observed above the S1 range could be due to melting (Tm) of polymer composites, which breaks down the cross-linking and reduces the internal strain leads to decomposition of composites (Osuntokun and Ajibade, 2016)."
21,Zeta potential,"The zeta potential of CR dyes at different pH after putting the composite adsorbent in the solution. The effect on zeta potential study was carried out by using 0.013 g of composite films and was determined for pH values between 4 and 10 as shown in Fig. 8 . It reveals surface charge of adsorbent is positive when the pH of the solution is lower than zero point charge (pHzpc). The charge on the adsorbent is negative when pH of the solution is higher than the pHpcz (Pinho and Piedade, 2013). It is expected that the chemical composition of adsorbent influences the zeta potential and conductivity of the solution. The zeta potential value supports the dye adsorption decreases from pH 4 to 10 due to electrostatic repulsion between adsorbent and anionic dye (Nelson et al., 2000)."
22,Adsorption studies,"5.1 Adsorption studies CR is one of the essential benzidine-based azo dye, easily soluble in water and commonly used in textile industries in molecular biological laboratories for staining. CR dye has an affinity to interact with fabrics and displays a bright red colour and widely used in under-developed countries (Mall et al., 2005). CR dye adsorption by the adsorption beads of S1–S5 films was determined by three parameters such as an effect of the contact time, an effect of the pH solution and an effect of the CR dye concentration with respect to time 30 min. The effect of film/nanoparticle loading on the percent removal of CR dye will increase generally due to increase in the adsorption sites (Li et al., 2019;Guo et al., 2019). This present observation deals with the S1 film and prepared S2–S5 films as adsorbents for the adsorption of CR dye shown in Fig. S5. The CR dye adsorption by S3 composite was determined by SEM EDX. The EDX and elemental mapping were used to confirm the adsorbed CR dye on S3 composite film as shown in Fig. S6 (a - f). The elemental mapping of S3 dye adsorbed composite showed specific regions of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, which confirm the adsorption of CR dye."
23,Effect of contact time on adsorption,"5.2 Effect of contact time on adsorption The effect of the contact time on dye adsorption of CR is shown in Fig. 9 (a). Initially when the contact time of S1 to S5 increases, the vacant sites are free to bind with the CR dye, which results in the enhancement of dye adsorption. The adsorption of CR dye increases as the contact time increases from 10 to 60 min with pH 7 at 37 °C (Chatterjee et al., 2007). The adsorption of CR (7–18%) by S1 film also increases as the contact time increase but the composites films (S2–S5) showed a significant increase in the CR dye adsorption (20–48%). The removal of azo dye from industrial wastewater in mg/L(Türgay et al., 2011). The dye adsorption increases from pure S1 to S3, but the dye adsorptions decrease in S4 and S5. The adsorption sites decrease as cross-linking increases in the composite. The result of dye adsorption can be clearly observed from the Fig. 9 (a) that S1 film shows minimum adsorption capacity as compared to composite up to certain limit then adsorption capacity decreases due to increases the cross-linking of composites."
24,Effect of pH solution on dye adsorption,"5.3 Effect of pH solution on dye adsorption The pH is an important parameter that can competently impact the dye adsorption potential on to adsorbent beads. The adsorption of CR by S1– S5 films is inversely proportional to the pH of the solution Fig. 9 (b). The adsorption from S1 to S3 increases due to availability of more adsorption sites on the composite films, but the adsorption decreases from S4 to S5 because intense crosslinking between PVA and increased wt. % of MF minimizes the adsorption sites on the composite films. The protonation of composites films decreases as the pH increases from (4, 6, 8, 9, and 10) and the CR dye adsorption decreases with increases pH in the solution. In the acidic media, CR is acidic dye develop more positive charge as NH4 + appears as main product followed by NO3 − and SO4 2− and the polymer composites carry OH and NH groups that developed strong electrostatic attraction in lower pH solution (Chatterjee et al., 2007). The CR dye in the higher pH solution decreased the protonation in the solution increases the electrostatic repulsion among like a charges reduced the dye adsorption."
25,Effect of CR dye concentration on adsorption,"5.4 Effect of CR dye concentration on adsorption The dye adsorption of CR increases as the concentration increases from 50 to 200 ppm in S1–S5 films, respectively with respect to 30 min. The dye adsorption initially increases from S1 to S3 by increases the CR dye concentration. The intense cross-linking between the PVA and high wt. % of MF reduces the rough surface and adsorption sites in the composite films (S4–S5) as compared to S3 film shown in Fig. 9. The dye adsorption of S1 to S5 increases as the concentration of dye increases from 50 to 200 ppm, but the maximum inter and intra-molecular cross-linked polymer composites with minimum adsorption sites decreases the dye adsorption capacity (Shabnam et al., 2019). The dye removal result accredits the fact of electrostatic interaction and complexation with –NH– and –OH groups of the composite with CR dye."
26,Modeling of CR dye adsorption kinetics on the polymer composite,"5.5 Modeling of CR dye adsorption kinetics on the polymer composite The S3 polymer composite film has been used for the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm studies to minimize the error. The kinetics of the adsorption of CR dye on S3 composite was calculated by using pseudo-first order [Eq. (5.1)] and pseudo-second order [Eq. (5.2)] models, which are commonly used to determine the sorption kinetics. The rate constants and other parameters were determined by their non-linear forms: 5.1 q t = q e ( 1 − e - k 1. t ) 5.2 q t = ( K 2 q e 2 . t ( 1 + K 2 q e . t Where, qt is the amount of CR dye adsorbed (mg/g) at time t, qe is the CR dye adsorbed at equilibrium (mg/g), and k1, k2 are pseudo-first and pseudo-second order rate constants, respectively. The plot of qt vs t gave the values of qe, k1 and k2 for pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order models (Fig. 10), which are summarized in Table 2 . The R2 for pseudo-first order was 0.821, whereas for pseudo-second order model it was 0.944, which confirmed the good applicability of pseudo second order model."
27,Modeling of CR dye adsorption isotherm on the polymer composite,"5.6 Modeling of CR dye adsorption isotherm on the polymer composite Non-liner form of four isotherm models at three different temperatures (25 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C) has been carried out to calculate the maximum CR dye adsorption capacity of S3 composite and other parameters. The adsorption equilibrium data were tailored by Langmuir and Freundlich models to determine the absorption capacity and affinity. The adsorption equilibrium data were tailored by Langmuir and Freundlich models to determine the absorption capacity and affinity. 5.6.1 Langmuir isotherm The Langmuir isotherm model is valid for homogenous monolayer adsorption onto the surface of composite film. The Langmuir equation assumes that there is no interaction between adsorbate molecules and the adsorbent after the dye molecule occupies the vacant site (Khan et al., 2015). Non-linear form of Langmuir equation is given in eq. (5.3). 5.3 q e = Q m bC e 1 + bC e Where Ce is the equilibrium concentration of CR in solution (mg/L), Qm is the maximum adsorption capacity; qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg/g) of the adsorbent corresponding to complete monolayer. The parameters of Langmuir model were obtained by plotting Ce vs qe as shown in Fig. 11 and are given in Table 3 . The Langmuir adsorption capacity (Qm) valves at 298 k for CR dye 221.43 calculated by using the non-linear [eq. (5.3)] observed good adsorption capacity of S3 composite at 25 °C as compared to 30 °C and 40 °C (Table 3). The separation factor RL (0.66 and 0.68) values were in the range of 0–1 for CR dye which depicts positive adsorption process. The maximum adsorption capacity (mg g−1) for CR dye on S3 polymer composite with various adsorbents revealed the moderate adoption capacity for S3 composites. The adsorption performance of the prepared material-PVA/MF has been compared with PVA and MF based other adsorbents as shown in Table 4 . 5.6.2 Freundlich Isotherm The Freundlich adsorption isotherm shows exponential decrement in the adsorption energy due to occupation of vacant adsorption sites over the period of time leads to heterogeneous surfaces of adsorbent having different energy values of adsorption (Laus et al., 2010). The Freundlich isotherm model is therefore employed (Khan et al., 2020) for non-linear form is given by eq. (5.4). 5.4 q e = ( K f C e ) 1 n Where Kf (L/g) is a relative parameter of the capacity of adsorption in multilayer, 1/n adsorption potential whose values rages from zero to unity. The parameters of the model were determined by plotting Ce vs qe as shown in Fig. 12. The values of 1/n were observed to be 0.793–784 for CR dye signifies the adsorption process is favorable (Table 3). Based on correlation coefficient (R 2 ) and standard error of estimation (SEE), Freundlich model exhibited a better fit for the equilibrium data which implies multilayer sorption on S3 composite film."
28,In-vitro antibacterial activity,
29,Zone of inhibition (ZOI),"6.1 Zone of inhibition (ZOI) Another most important application of functional polymer composite films for the wound dressing applications and packing material to prevent the soft and delicate industrial materials from the bacterial deterioration. The antibacterial activity of S1–S5 films were determined by a zone of inhibition (ZOI) measured in mm scale and minimum inhibitory concentration μg/mL. Film samples with equal size were placed on MHA plates containing bacterial strains like E. coli 25922, K. pneumonia e 700603, B.subtilis 4736 and S. aureus 5902 and antibiotic disc colistin (CL) used as a positive control shown in Fig. 13 . All the plates incubated at 37 °C for overnight. The clear ZOI across the film was measured in mm scale. Negligible ZOI was observed against different bacterial strains by S1 film as shown in Fig. S7. The antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumonia e , B. subtilis and S. aureus values are 19 mm, 28 mm, 30 mm and 43 mm respectively, confirms increased antibacterial activity of composites S2–S5 films. The enhancement of antibacterial activity of PVA modified by quaternized cellulose (YMP) against gram positive (S. aureus) and gram negative (E. coli) was analyzed by disc diffusion method supports our results (Hu and Wang, 2016b). Antibacterial activity of polyvinyl alcohol/HTCC/CMC blend film was reported against E. coli and S. aureus by the disk diffusion method (Hu et al., 2017. The ZOI of composite films increased as the MF concentration against different bacterial strains. The electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged bacterial cell wall with the composite films."
30,Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum lethal concentration,"6.2 Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum lethal concentration The ZOI was confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentration against gram-positive S. aureus and gram-negative bacteria E.coli and K. pneumonia e in Fig. 14 . The MIC of (S1) and composite films (S2–S5) were determined against gram-negative as well as gram-positive bacterial strains by broth microdilution method. Bacterial strains in broth medium without composite material addition and PVA would show fast growth profile. The MIC of composite films (S2–S5) increases as MF concentration increases in the composite films are 200 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL against respective bacterial strains such as E. coli 25922, K. pneumoniae 700603, B. subtilis 4736 and S. aureus 5902. The MIC of composite films (S4 and S5) was observed at 100 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL against respective bacterial strains. All the composite films have shown good MIC but (S4 and S5) has shown best MIC as well as ZOI. Further, minimum lethal concentration (MLC) of composite films (S2–S5) against all tested bacterial strains was determined by killing assay. The concentration at which a composite film showed 50% killing of bacteria were considered as MLC50. Fig. S8 showed the MLC50 values for the composite films (S2–S5) against E. coli 25922, K. pneumoniae 700603, B. subtilis 4736 and S. aureus 5902. The MLC50 values varied in the range of 100 μg/mL to 600 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL to 200 μg/mL against gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria respectively as shown in Fig. S8. The MLC values should in principle have same or higher concentrations than the corresponding MIC values which able to kill all bacterial cells. The composite film S5 showed highest bactericidal activity and same MLC50 values corresponding to MIC values against all tested strains. Overall S4 and S5 film showed less MLC50 values and better antibacterial activity as compared others film due to increase MF concentration. The mechanism and antibacterial efficiency of polymer nanocomposites depend on the different nonspecific interaction such as hydrogen bonding, the reaction between sulfhydryl groups as well as covalent bond formation between protein and polymer composites (Akiyama, 2001). The bacterial cell adhered on the surface of polymer composite films during the incubation time. On the direct contact, the presence of polar groups (OH, NH and CO) on polymer composite films disintegrates the bacterial cell membrane releasing the cell ingredients causing the death of bacteria (Liu et al., 2004). It is clear from the results that gram-positive bacteria B. subtilis 4736 and S. aureus 5902 were most susceptible to polymer composite as compared to gram-negative bacteria E. coli 25922 and K. pneumoniae 70060. The negative bacterial strains possess different components in the cell wall. An outer phospholipidic membrane with largely negative charged structural lipopolysaccharide unites which preventive like charged polymer composites reduces the antibacterial activity."
31,Conclusion,"The dual functional composite films (S2–S5) (dye adsorption and antibacterial) were developed by means of chemical crosslinking between PVA and MF. The composite films obtained are chemical and thermally stable, bio-degradable, amorphous nature along with rough surface as compared to pure PVA. The enhancement of thermal stability was attributed to chemical crosslinking reactions and hydrogen bonding and DSC thermograms showed one broad glass transition temperature peak, which supported the single-phase behaviour of polymer composites films. The PVA showed maximum swelling property but least stable as compared to composite films and the chemical stability enhanced from S1 to S5 in all three parameters such as water, HCl and NaOH solutions. The hydrophobicity is responsible for the reduction in swelling of composite films confirmed by the increased contact angle from S1–S5. The soil degradation increases from S1–S5 (6–25%) due to enzymatic bacterial degradation. The percent removal of CR dye capacity increases from S1 to composite adsorbents in all three parameters. The maximum adsorption capacity 221.43 mg/g of CR dye was determined by using Langmuir model from aqueous solution. The adsorption isotherm and kinetics modeling data were described by Freundlich isotherm over whole concentration range and pseudo-second order rate, respectively. The MF improved antibacterial activity against four bacterial strains, but the best zone of inhabitation was against the B. subtilis 4736 30 mm and S. aureus 5902 43 mm of composite films than pure PVA. The present results may be a roadmap to develop some most advanced transparent and flexible composites films for water treatment in textile industries for cleaner production and efficient antibacterial activity."
