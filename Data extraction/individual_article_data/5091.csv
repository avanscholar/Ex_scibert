0,Introduction,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are increasing rapidly to serve the requirements of the growing population and the developing industry (Foladori, 2010). Biological treatment of wastewater is a highly sustainable treatment process but resulting in large amount of waste activated sludge (WAS) (Wei et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019). Increased sludge production could incur substantial disposal costs, thus reducing sludge amounts has a strong economic motivation. Anaerobic fermentation is the most widely adopted method for sludge treatment, by which the high levels of organic matters in sludge could be bio-converted into value-added products, such as methane or/and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, those with ≤ 5 carbon chains), thereby realizing the energy recovery and sludge reduction/stabilization (Appels et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014). However, the sum of energy recovered through WAS anaerobic fermentation is typically only 5–7% of the total available energy owing to the low energy density of methane and SCFAs (Steinbusch et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2017a). Besides, SCFAs feature high hydrophilicity due to the short carbon chain, thus the operation of separation and purification of SCFAs from the fermentation liquor is complicated and energy intensive, which largely limits the economic viability of WAS anaerobic fermentation (Wu et al., 2019). More importantly, the low hydrolysis rates of WAS generally restrained WAS anaerobic fermentation, resulting in less fermentation products and unfavorable sludge reduction (Wang et al., 2013). Recently, the medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs, those contain 6–12 carbon chains) have been considered (Angenent et al., 2016) as more profitable anaerobic products. Due to their higher carbon/oxygen ratio, MCFAs have the higher energy densities and economic value than the traditional methane and SCFAs. MCFAs are superior precursor for biofuels or industrial chemicals process (Agler et al., 2012a; Shu et al., 2011). Besides, MCFAs have excellent separation property due to their relatively low solubilities, which simplify the separation procedure from the fermentation liquor with much less energy input than SCFAs (Angenent et al., 2016). The in-line product extraction also prevents the toxic effect of accumulated acids on microorganisms and ensures the stable MCFAs production (Ge et al., 2015). Chain elongation (CE) (Chen et al., 2017; Ge et al., 2015; Spirito et al., 2014) is an emerging biotechnology to transform SCFAs into MCFAs via the reverse β-oxidization pathway. The pathway of chain elongation is a cyclic process and utilizes an acetyl-CoA molecule each cycle, which comes from an electron donor (ED), coupling with a SCFA (as the electron acceptor (EA)) and extending its carbon chain length with two carbons (C2) (Angenent et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2018). Several electron donors that have been utilized to elongate carboxylates are ethanol (Coma et al., 2016; González et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017; Steinbusch et al., 2011), lactate (Kucek et al., 2016a; Zhu et al., 2015), methanol (Genthner et al., 1981), n-propanol (Kenealy and Waselefsky, 1985), D-galactitol (Angenent et al., 2016) and amino acids in peptides (Wallace et al., 2004). During the use with lactate as ED, it was reported that lactate would split to the conversion to propionate via acrylate pathway, reducing the lactate-carbon flow to MCFA-producing via chain elongation pathway (Wu et al., 2018). Proofs of other electron donors were only made with pure bacterial cultures (Angenent et al., 2016) or suggested less production of MCFAs. Therefore, ethanol is considered as the most suitable electron donor for MCFAs production with the function of microbiome via chain elongation (Wu et al., 2018). Many substrates were used for the production of MCFAs, including glucose, gaseous products and organic wastes (Levy et al., 1981; Thauer et al., 1968; Kucek et al., 2016c; Xu et al., 2017; Weimer et al., 2015; Lonkar et al., 2016), which can be converted to different types of SCFAs as starting molecules via anaerobic fermentation. MCFAs production performances depended on the properties of substrates. For example, Weimer et al. (2015) utilized the cellulosic biomass (alfalfa stems or switchgrass herbage) as substrates and the produced MCFA was only caproate with little amount. In contrast, a large amount of caproate, heptanoate, caprylate and nonanoic acid were produced by acid whey as substrate (Xu et al., 2017). Different from other organic matters, WAS has unique property, which is composed of a mass of organic substances (mainly carbohydrate and protein, occupying 40–80%) and microbial cells (Wei et al., 2017b). However, the MCFAs production from anaerobic fermentation of WAS has never been documented. Herein, this study aimed to demonstrate the MCFAs production from WAS as a feedstock substrate with enhanced WAS degradation in a one-stage anaerobic fermentation system with ethanol as electron donor. The MCFAs production, products distribution and WAS degradation at different ethanol levels were investigated and compared. The mechanisms of enhanced MCFAs production and WAS degradation by ethanol were studied from the aspect of the conversions of metabolic intermediates. Moreover, the shift of microbial communities was analyzed and linked to the apparent performance of CE. This work is expected to provide a novel insight into the sludge reduction and energy recovery."
1,Material and methods,
2,Substrate and inoculum,"2.1 Substrate and inoculum The utilized WAS was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal WWTP located in Shanghai, China treating domestic wastewater. After concentrated for 1d by gravity, the WAS was reserved at 4 °C for later use. The primary characteristics of the concentrated sludge were listed in Table S1 in Supporting Information (SI). The inoculum (anaerobically digested sludge, ADS) was the acclimatized sludge harvested from a semi-continuous mesophilic anaerobic fermenter (hydraulic retention time: 15 d) fed with ethanol and acetic acid for MCFAs production. The semi-continuous reactor was controlled at 37 ± 1 °C with a sludge retention time of 20 d."
3,Experiments of MCFAs production from anaerobic WAS fermentation,"2.2 Experiments of MCFAs production from anaerobic WAS fermentation In this study, MCFAs production from the WAS with a wide range of ethanol levels (i.e., 0, 42.5, 85 and 170 mmol/L) was assessed using four series of test serum bottles (120 mL working volume) to demonstrate the feasibility of MCFAs production and the involving mechanisms of ethanol. Within each serum bottle, it contained 4.8 mL of inoculum and 4.8 mL of WAS with 37.5 mL of growth medium, whose component was detailed in the SI. Afterwards, 0, 42.5, 85 and 170 mmol/L of ethanol was added into the four test bottles, respectively. Then, the pH value was set as 5.5 ± 0.1 with 3 mol/L NaOH and HCl solution, which was the optimum pH for chain elongation (Ge et al., 2015). Finally, after flushed with nitrogen gas (with high purity) for 5 min, all vials were sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps, and then stirred in a shaker-incubator (37 ± 1 °C, 170 rpm). Correspondingly, four blanks were also established to evaluate the effects of the inoculation sludge on MCFAs production with the studied ethanol levels (i.e., 0, 42.5, 85 and 170 mmol/L). Each blank was identical to the corresponding test vial except that WAS was replaced by the same volume of tap water. The fermentation time lasted for over 30 days without further MCFAs accumulation. Each test was performed in triplicate. Every 2–3 days, the liquid samples (2 mL) were collected, centrifuged (12000 rpm, 5 min) and filtered with a 0.45 μm filter. The products concentration from WAS were calculated by subtracting the concentration in the blank bottle (i.e., ADS with ethanol) from that in the corresponding test bottle (i.e., WAS and ADS with ethanol)."
4,"Role of ethanol in solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification in WAS degradation","2.3 Role of ethanol in solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification in WAS degradation Usually, the WAS degradation during anaerobic fermentation contains three steps, i.e., solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification (Wei et al., 2019), which were detailed in the SI. These processes accompany with the production of SCFAs, which were served as the substrates for the CE process and elongated into MCFAs. It is thus necessary to explore the influence of ethanol on these processes in order to explain the different performance with the ethanol participation. The experiments of effects of ethanol (0 mmol/L as control and 170 mmol/L as test) on these three processes were conducted with the model substrates (Mu and Chen, 2011) as follows. Solubilization tests: the experiment was carried out under the same operation as the above MCFAs production experiment. After fermenting for 2 days, determining the soluble protein and carbohydrate. Besides, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and DNA in fermentation liquid were measured to assess the cell membrane integrity. Each fermentation liquid was characterized by excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy to further indicate the level of WAS degradation. Hydrolysis tests: bovine serum albumin (BSA, average molecular weight Mw 67000), and dextran (average molecular weight Mw∼23800) were chosen as model protein and polysaccharide compounds, respectively (Mu and Chen, 2011). The hydrolysis test was operated with the identical method depicted in solubilization test in addition to that the WAS was replaced with the same volume of synthetic wastewater, whose component were shown in SI. Then, adding 4 g/L of BSA and 1 g/L dextran in the synthetic wastewater. By determining the BSA and dextran degradation after the fermentation for 2 days, the effect of ethanol on WAS hydrolysis was obtained. Acidification tests: the same operations were conducted with the above approach except that selecting 4 g/L of L-glutamate and 1 g/L of glucose as model amino acid and monosaccharide compound. The concentrations of VFAs were measured after the fermentation for 4 days."
5,Microbial community analysis,"2.4 Microbial community analysis After the four test groups reached stable performance for MCFAs production, three samples were withdrawn from each group and mixed. The microbial communities of four mixed samples from the four test groups and raw WAS as well as the inoculum were analyzed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Briefly, 10 ml of fully mixed and homogeneous sludge mixture was withdrawn and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5min. The microbial genomic DNA were extracted with the E.Z.N.A. soil DNA kit (Omega Biotek, Norcross, GA, U.S.). The V4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rRNA gene were amplified with primers 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACH VGGGTWTCTAAT-3′). Purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired-end sequenced (2 × 300) on Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, USA). The sequence data were processed at Majorbo Bio-Pharm Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China)."
6,Analytical procedures,"2.5 Analytical procedures The measurement including TS, VS, TCOD, SCOD were performed with the same approach as reported in literature (Wei et al., 2019). The gas composition (i.e., hydrogen and methane) was analyzed by gas chromatography (LUNAN, SP-6890, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The liquid component (i.e., alcohols, SCFAs and MCFAs) were measured by a Gas Chromatography (SHIMADAU GC, 2010 Plus, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector. Protein, carbohydrate, LDH/DNA and EEM fluorescence spectra were measured according to the methods detailed in SI."
7,Results,
8,MCFAs production from anaerobic fermentation of WAS,"3.1 MCFAs production from anaerobic fermentation of WAS Fig. 1 shows the ethanol utilization and MCFAs production from WAS (i.e., subtracting the production in the blank vial for ADS with ethanol solely) over the whole fermentation period. During the anaerobic fermentation of WAS without the ethanol addition, a continuous accumulation of total SCFAs (i.e., acetate and n-butyrate) from WAS was observed (shown in Fig. 1a). Apparently, MCFAs was hardly synthesized with single SCFAs, demonstrating that the existence of ED was the prerequisite of feasible CE (Wu et al., 2018). Expectably, the MCFAs were produced with the ethanol participation (42.5–170 mmol/L). At ethanol of 42.5 mmol/L (shown in Fig. 1b), ethanol decreased rapidly and depleted during the fermentation for 9 days, whereas the n-caproate and n-caprylate as the main MCFAs components emerged on Day 7, and their productions gradually increased and peaked on Day 24 (n-caproate: 710 ± 28 mg COD/L, n-caprylate: 1293 ± 32 mg COD/L). Afterwards, the concentrations of MCFAs remained stable, which was likely attribute to the exhaustion of ED. When the ethanol dosage increased to 85 mmol/L (shown in Fig. 1c), the ethanol was nearly drained on Day 17. Although the 85 mmol/L of ethanol dosage extended the lag phase (14 days) in the CE reactions compared to that (7 days) of the 42.5 mmol/L of ethanol dosage, more MCFAs from WAS were produced through the 30 days’ CE process. The maximal n-caproate and n-caprylate concentrations were 1335 ± 64 mg COD/L and 945 ± 21 mg COD/L, respectively. During the 30 days’ CE process, the highest MCFAs production from WAS occurred at the 170 mmol/L of ethanol dosage (shown in Fig. 1d). At the starting point of CE, ethanol was consumed fast to 63.2 mmol/L while n-caproate as the sole component of MCFAs appeared on day 7 and reached a maximum value of 6320 ± 156 mg COD/L on Day 24. Interesting, 805 ± 92 mg COD/L of n-hexanol was also synthesized. Although the residual ethanol and n-butyrate was observed, the cumulative MCFAs concentration kept constant. It is likely that the undissociated caproate exerted toxic effects in the microorganism related to CE process. Vasudevan et al. (2014) reported that the inhibition of MCFAs production occurred once the concentration of undissociated caproate reaches ∼0.2 g/L. The concentration of undissociated caproate at the case with 170 mmol/L of ethanol was determined as ∼0.53 g/L. Overall, the MCFAs production from WAS was successfully achieved with the addition of ethanol as ED and the increased ethanol led to higher MCFAs production. The main MCFAs products were n-caproate and n-caprylate under the ethanol dosage of 42.5 and 85 mmol/L, while n-caproate was the sole MCFA product at the ethanol dosage of 170 mmol/L, with the production of longer chain alcohol (i.e., n-heptanol) as well."
9,Products distribution and MCFAs selectivity,"3.2 Products distribution and MCFAs selectivity Fig. 2 summarizes the product distribution based on the converted SCOD from WAS from the four tests. At ethanol concentration of 0, 42.5, 85, 170 mmol/L, the converted SCOD from WAS which deduct from ethanol conversion were 0.04, 0.23, 0.42, 0.51 g COD, respectively. The methane in each case was not detected. Without the ethanol participation, SCFAs (i.e., acetate and n-butyrate) occupied the maximum proportions of 83.9 ± 6.6%, which could not be further elongated into MCFAs due to the lack of ED. The 5.2 ± 0.7% SCOD existed in and the remaining 10.9 ± 1.8% of SCOD might be the intermediate metabolites that were not completely hydrolyzed and acidified. The SCFAs proportion decreased to 25.7 ± 5.2% with the addition of 42.5 mmol/L of ethanol, but the n-caproate and n-caprylate appeared, accounting for 12.1% and 18.2%, respectively. Besides, a remaining 42.8 ± 1.2% of the converted SCOD was not further converted to SCFAs or MCFAs. Increasing ethanol dosage to 85 mmol/L, the SCFAs proportion further decreased to 16.8 ± 0.2%, accompanying the increment of MCFAs (i.e., n-caproate and n-caprylate). The unaccounted SCOD decreased to 31.9 ± 1.4%. In contrast, n-caproate as the main product of the fermentation occupied 56.2 ± 1.2% at the highest ethanol level of 170 mmol/L. Interestingly, a longer-chain alcohol, n-hexanol, was produced with 7.4 ± 0.8% proportion instead of n-caprylate. Only 11.4% of unaccounted SCOD was remained in the fermentation liquor, suggesting that ethanol could enhance the SCOD to be further converted into SCFAs or MCFAs. MCFAs selectivity represents the proportion of MCFAs in all fermentation products. As seen in Fig. 2, MCFAs selectivity was on the rise as increased ethanol dosage. At the ethanol dosage of 0, 42.5, 85 and 170 mmol/L, the MCFAs selectivity was 0%, 30.3%, 33.0% and 56.2%, respectively. This revealed that ethanol participation as ED is effective in enhancing both MCFAs production and selectivity from WAS fermentation via CE process."
10,Enhanced WAS degradation by ethanol addition,"3.3 Enhanced WAS degradation by ethanol addition During the WAS anaerobic fermentation, the cells and/or particulate organic substrates in WAS is degraded with the release of soluble organic substrates. The total SCOD from WAS were 0.04, 0.23, 0.42, 0.51 g COD at ethanol concentration of 0, 42.5, 85 and 170 mmol/L, respectively. Fig. 2 presents the SCOD distribution from WAS during the entire CE period (i.e., 30 days) at different ethanol levels. In general, the addition of ethanol as ED led to a significant increase of SCOD yield and increased ethanol level gave rise to an enhanced release of SCOD. For the WAS without the ethanol addition, the SCOD yield was only 0.38 g COD/g VS. In contrast, SCOD content increased from 0.45 to 0.61 g COD/g VS over the same period with the increase of ethanol dosage from 42.5 to 85 mmol/L. The SCOD content from WAS further increased to 0.72 g COD/g VS at the greatest ethanol level tested (170 mmol/L), indicating that the WAS via CE process with 170 mmol/L of ethanol as EDs was degraded 1.9 times (0.72 versus 0.38 g COD/g VS) that without ethanol participation (0 mmol/L)."
11,Mechanisms of enhanced WAS degradation and MCFAs productions,"3.4 Mechanisms of enhanced WAS degradation and MCFAs productions From the above results, the ethanol participation is effective in enhancing both WAS degradation and MCFAs production with WAS as substrate. During WAS anaerobic fermentation, WAS degradation usually undergoes several key steps, such as the solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification processes, accompanying the productions of SCFAs, which were subsequently elongated into MCFAs. It is thus required to investigate the influence of ethanol on these processes in order to explain the potential mechanism. These processes usually co-occur in the real anaerobic fermenters. In this work, consequently, a succession of model substrates was used to indicate the role of ethanol in these processes. Protein and carbohydrate generally are the dominant constituents of WAS (Mu and Chen, 2011), which can be released from sludge cells and/or converted from sludge particulate organic matters during the solubilization process. Fig. 3 a presents the protein and carbohydrate contents after 2 days fermentation with and without the ethanol participation. As seen from Fig. 3a, the ethanol significantly (P = 0.03) increased the release of protein, while the polysaccharide content did not show a change (P > 0.05) compared to that without the ethanol addition. Besides, the LDH and DNA, as cell membrane integrity markers (Wang et al., 2018), which could be used to reveal the effect of ethanol on disruption of WAS cells. Fig. 3b showed the measurements of LDH and DNA releases after the fermentation for 2 days with and without the ethanol participation. Aligning to the results of protein and carbohydrate contents, the 170 mmol/L of ethanol significantly increased the LDH and DNA releases by 24.5 ± 0.71% and 25 ± 1.41%, respectively, suggesting that the addition of ethanol did incur more leakage of intracellular substrates. The organics released in fermentation liquid were further characterize by the three-dimension EEM fluorescence spectroscopy. The images with and without the ethanol participation are shown in Fig. 3c and d. One major peak at the Ex/Em of 270–280/360–370 nm presented in EEM fluorescence spectra of two fermentation liquids. This location of EEM peak is generally related to tryptophan & Protein-like of Region IV (Wen et al., 2015). The ethanol participation clearly enhanced the fluorescence intensity of this peak, implying that the ethanol promoted more protein substances be released in the fermentation liquid. The impact of ethanol on the hydrolysis of WAS solubilized products (i.e., soluble protein and carbohydrate) is shown in Fig. 3e. The ethanol enhanced the degradation of the BSA (model protein) rather than the dextran (model carbohydrate). Without the ethanol addition, the BSA degradation was 31.0 ± 4.2% after the anaerobic fermentation for 2 days. In comparison, the BSA degradation with the 170 mmol/L of ethanol over the same period was 50.5 ± 2.1%, indicating a significant (P = 0.03) increase of 19.5%. The dextran degradation efficiency was relatively high and the impact of ethanol on the dextran degradation was insignificant (P > 0.05). The effect of ethanol on the accumulation of SCFAs is shown in Fig. 3f. The produced SCFAs in each case mainly contained acetate and n-butyrate. The total SCFA concentrations after the fermentation for 4 days with 0 and 170 mmol/L of ethanol were 2428 ± 34 and 3092 ± 62 mg COD/L, respectively. Obviously, the ethanol had a positive effect on acidification process. Based on these results, the ethanol participation improved WAS degradation by enhancing the solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification processes, thereby increasing the SCFAs production. As the substrates of MCFAs, the more SCFAs were subsequently elongated into more MCFAs via CE process."
12,Changes of microbial community for MCFAs production,"3.5 Changes of microbial community for MCFAs production To figure out the mechanisms of MCFAs production using WAS as substrate deeply, the microbial community was characterized based on the four samples (R0, R1, R2 and R3) from the bottles with the studied dosage of ethanol (i.e., 0, 42.5, 85 and 170 mmol/L) after reached stable performance for MCFA production. In addition, two samples from the inoculum and the WAS were also included. For all samples, 28,933 high-quality sequence reads were obtained after normalization. The overall number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was 748, with 252 shared by the six samples (Fig. S1). The rarefaction curves (Fig. S2) of all samples nearly reached apexes and smoothness, indicating that the sequencing data of each sample had a high quality and was reliable to cover the whole microbial diversity. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on the community diversity of the whole microbiomes shown in Fig. 4 a reflected the divergence 16S rRNA sequences of different CE sludge samples. The PC1 and PC2 occupied for 75.63% of the total community variations. According to the distribution distance, microbiomes of “R1” “R2” and “R3” with the ethanol clustered together, while the microbiomes of “R0” “WAS” and “inoculum” remained dispersed, suggesting clear shifts of microbial communities after the addition of ethanol. Fig. 4b exhibits the phylum-level distributions of the microbial abundances of the six samples. With the ethanol participation, Aminicenantes, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the four dominant phyla, occupying for ∼59%, 64% and 62% in R1, R2 and R3, respectively. Among in the above phyla, a lot of bacteria were reported capable of promoting organic matters (e.g., proteins and carbohydrates) degradation (Wang et al., 2018). In contrast, these four phyla mentioned above in the R0 (with 0 mmol/L ethanol) just accounted for 44%. In particular, the addition of ethanol caused increase in the abundances of Firmicutes from 5% to 13–18%, which was correlated with CE process (Wu et al., 2018). The microbial communities at genus level (Fig. 5 ) in the six samples contained of lots of anaerobes related with hydrolysis (e.g., Bacteroides sp.), acidogenesis (e.g., Proteiniclasticum sp., Escherichia-Shigella sp., Parabacteroides sp. and Collinsella sp.) as well as chain elongation (e.g., Clostridium sp., Oscillibacter sp. and Dechloromonas sp.) (Kucek et al., 2016b; Wang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018). Part of these microbial abundances were influenced by the ethanol. For instance, the relative abundance of Bacteroides sp. in R0 was 0.02%, lower than those (0.2–1.2%) in the vials with the ethanol participation. The above result indicates that the addition of ethanol had positive correlation on the abundance of hydrolytic microorganisms. The relative abundances of Escherichia-Shigella sp. and Parabacteroides sp. also increased from 0.001% to 0.003% in R0 to 0.05–0.1% and 0.26–2.5% in R1-R3, respectively, which was in accord with the results of enhanced acidification test with the ethanol addition observed in Fig. 3f. When MCFAs have been produced with the ethanol as EDs, an OTU for Clostridium sensu stricto_12 sp. surged in the relative abundances. Moreover, Oscillibacter sp. is generally consider as the predominant bacteria for MCFA production during ethanol-acetate fermentation system (Wu et al., 2018) and their relative abundances in R1, R2 and R3 were higher than that in R0. These results confirmed that the microbial community with the ethanol participation was diverted to the favorable direction toward hydrolysis, acidification and chain elongation, which was accord with the higher produce of MCFAs discovered in the experiments."
13,Discussion,"This research experimentally demonstrated for the first time the MCFAs production from anaerobic fermentation with WAS as a feedstock and ethanol as electron donors with enhanced WAS degradation in a one-stage anaerobic fermentation system. The addition of ethanol as electron donor was clearly beneficial to the MCFAs production from WAS and the increased ethanol levels led to higher MCFAs production. The maximum MCFAs production from WAS was achieved at 5.37 mg COD/L. This finding was accordance with previous reports. Liu et al. (2016) found that the higher ratio of ethanol to acid improved the n-caproate production (exceed 3000 mg/L) at the reaction stable phase. Lonkar et al. (2016) reported that although MCFAs yield almost doubled when the ethanol level was increased to 108 mmol/L, the ethanol concentration should be within the appropriate range. The maximum tolerable concentration of pure-culture and open-culture microorganisms to ethanol was 460 mmol/L and 300 mmol/L, respectively (Kucek et al., 2016; Weimer and Stevenson, 2012). Exceeding this range, MCFAs production would be affected. Strikingly, the n-caprylate was produced at the lower ethanol level (e.g., 42.5 and 85 mmol/L) rather than the higher level (e.g., 170 mmol/L). This was likely attributed to the toxicity of mass-produced MCFAs affecting the further chain elongation. Lonkar et al. (2016) also reported that the high concentration of propanol (i.e., above 15 g/L) as ED even ceased the production of n-heptanoate. However, Spirito et al. (2018) applied MCFA extraction method in the experiment to alleviate the toxicity of undissociated MCFAs and found that higher ethanol levels result in higher specificities for n-caprylate production. Besides, a longer chain alcohol (i.e., n-heptanol) was produced at the higher ethanol level in this study, which may be attributed to the reduction of carboxylates (Agler et al., 2011). The carboxylates reduction has been observed in several fermentation process (Diender et al., 2016; Steinbusch et al., 2008). Carboxylates are first reduced to aldehydes with ethanol or other organic substance as electron donor, and then further is reduced to their corresponding alcohols (Liu et al., 2014; Richter et al., 2016; Tashiro et al., 2004). Agler et al. (2011) also found that the produced carboxylates were reduced to alcohols with hydrogen or ethanol via secondary fermentation. Besides, the increased ethanol could enhance the converted SCOD from WAS to be further converted into MCFAs, thereby improving the MCFAs selectively. Grootscholten et al. (2013a) also reported that increasing the ethanol load from 13 g L−1 d−1 to 26 g L−1 d −1 led to MCFA selectivity increased from 78% to 91%. The maximum MCFA selectivity according to the converted SCOD from WAS and consumed ethanol in this study was 56.2% (Fig. 2). This selectivity is lower than that obtained in previous reports with the SCFAs as the direct substrate (Grootscholten et al., 2013b, 2014; Wu et al., 2018), which is mainly limited by SCFAs conversion from WAS via hydrolysis and acidification. Similarly, Lonkar et al. (2016) also obtained a lower MCFA selectivity of ∼23% with office paper and chicken manure as the substrates and ethanol as ED. The ethanol increased WAS degradation to up to 1.9 times as much as that without the ethanol, which was mainly ascribed to the enhanced sludge solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification with the function of ethanol (Fig. 3). This was also supported by the changes of relevant microbial community. The ethanol participation enriched lots of anaerobes related to hydrolysis (e.g., Bacteroides sp.) and acidogenesis (e.g., Escherichia-Shigella sp. and Parabacteroides sp.). The WAS degradation was improved by ethanol, leading to the higher production of SCFAs, which was the substrate of chain elongation, thereby enhancing MCFAs production. The final pH value in fermentation system was ∼5.2, which was still favorable for microbes relevant to chain elongation. The MCFAs production was found to be positively related to the abundance of chain elongation bacteria, such as Clostridium sp. and Oscillibacter sp. In previous studies with similar inoculum, the positive correlations between the MCFAs production and the relative abundance of these microbes responsible for CE were also observed (Wu et al., 2018). A social and economic evaluation was conducted based on the results of lab-scale test in this study to estimate the potential social and economic feasibility of the proposed alternative WAS fermentation technology. With increasing MCFAs production (from 1875 to 6115 mg chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L) from WAS anaerobic fermentation, the net economic benefit is estimated to be around 487.80 to 1650.40 $/ton TS (Table S2), remarkable higher than that of control system without MCFAs production. This net benefit arises from the enhanced MCFAs and extra alcohols production associated benefit overweighing the additional costs for ethanol and methane inhibitor. Therefore, this novel WAS fermentation technology for MCFA production is economically favorable. The social consequence of this technology was also potentially friendly. In WWTPs, a large amount of WAS are produced during wastewater treatment, which can serve as substrates for MCFAs production via this novel and alternative WAS fermentation technology. Meanwhile, the WAS degradation is improved, reducing the amounts of sludge to be discarded into the environment. The generated MCFAs could be readily extracted onsite from anaerobic fermentation liquor using physical method, like a membrane liquid-liquid extraction system, thereby achieving a viable commercial production and application. The remaining highly degradable SCFAs-containing fermentation liquor serves, in turn, as a supplementary carbon source for improving the biological nutrients removal in WWTPs (Feng et al., 2009), ensuring WWTPs’ continuous and regular task. In general, this strategy shifts WWTPs from ‘linear economy’ to ‘circular economy’. It should be noted that the aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of MCFAs production from anaerobic WAS fermentation, thus the possible optimization of the overall process was not specifically explored. In particular, although a wide levels of ethanol were investigated aiming to cover a broad picture of the process, it is not necessary to apply these studied levels for MCFAs production from WAS. The further efforts on condition optimization should be carried out to facilitate MCFAs production. While ethanol enhancing MCFA production from WAS has potential, the addition of the ethanol might compromise the overall benefit of the system. As such, the alternative or more sustainable source of ethanol such as the use of ethanol-containing wastes (e.g., brewing wastewater) or in-situ ethanol generation from wastewater in a bio-electrochemical system might be capable of improving the overall benefit of the process, which require further investigations. It should also be noted that MCFAs produced by this technology might be a superior precursor for biofuels or industrial chemicals process. However, the direct application of the MCFAs produced from WAS into foods and medications may not yet be applicable at this stage."
14,Conclusion,"In this work, the feasibility of MCFAs production from WAS with ethanol as electron donor were experimentally demonstrated. The following conclusions can be summarized: • MCFAs production and selectivity from WAS increased with the ethanol levels in the anaerobic WAS fermentation system. • The solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification processes for SCFAs production from WAS were enhanced with the ethanol participation, thereby subsequently promoted the MCFAs production via CE process and WAS degradation. • The microbial community analyses confirmed the increased abundance of hydrolytic microorganism (i.e., Bacteroides sp.), acidification microorganisms (i.e., Escherichia-Shigella sp. and Parabacteroides sp.) and CE microorganisms (i.e., Clostridium sensu stricto_12 sp. and Oscillibacter sp.) for MCFAs production."
