0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is widely viewed as a clean and high efficient energy carrier that can be used for electricity generation through fuel cell systems with harmless water as only by-products so as to reduce emissions of pollutants into the environment [1–5]. Hydrogen has energy per mass content of 143MJkg−1, which is up to three times larger than liquid hydrocarbon based fuels [6]. Furthermore, the other advantages of using hydrogen are abundant availability, utilization of a variety of feedstocks and a variety of production technologies [7]. Hydrogen also could be used to produce ammonia and other fertilizers (e.g. urea), to upgrade heavy oils (like oil sands), and to produce other chemicals. To date, a number of different approaches are being developed in order to mass produce hydrogen such as water electrolysis, hydrocarbon reforming, photocatalytic method and biological technology etc [8–10]. However, steam reforming of non-renewable hydrocarbons, essentially natural gas, is still the most commonly used but generally neglecting the follow-up costs of the environmental impact [11–13]. In addition, the use of fossil fuels for secondary energy production is non-sustainable. Based on the sustainable development, there is a growing interest for hydrogen production from renewable sources such as bio-oil, bio-gas, bio-ethanol or bio-butanol etc [13–21]. Among the various renewable feedstock alternatives, ethanol has been regarded as an attractive feedstock due to its relatively high hydrogen content, availability, non-toxicity, storage or handling ease and safety [22,23]. As biomass takes in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for its growth, reforming of biomass-derived ethanol does not contribute to global warming. More importantly, ethanol production from lignocelluloses, the so-called 2nd bio-ethanol, will shed light on the possibility for the utilization of low-cost non-edible biomass such as agro-industrial wastes, forestry residue materials in order to resolve the competitive problem between food production and bio-ethanol formation [2]. The use of lignocelluloses not only significantly enlarges the availability of raw materials for ethanol production, but also considerably reduces the production cost. In recent years, steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and oxidative steam reforming (OSR) are the major processes for hydrogen production from ethanol. (1) CH3CH2OH+3H2O→6H2+2CO2 Ethanol SR (Eq. (1) is the most extensively studied system since it produces the highest hydrogen yield. This process is normally regarded as a combination of ethanol SR to syngas followed by water–gas shift (WGS, Eq. (2). (2) CO+H2O→H2+CO2 Thermodynamic analysis indicates that equilibrium H2 yield can be as high as 70mol% for ethanol SR at 700°C with a stoichiometric feed composition (ethanol/water=1/3) [24,25]. However, ethanol SR is highly endothermic, requiring the provision of large amounts of energy which enhances the operation cost. This serious drawback greatly hinders the practical hydrogen production, especially for on-board applications. (3) CH3CH2OH+1.5O2→3H2+2CO2 POX of ethanol is an alternative process for hydrogen production. Comparing to ethanol SR, POX technology is exothermic and fast, making it suitable for coping with rapid load variations, such as those required for on-board reformers which often work under fluctuating conditions. Meanwhile, another advantage of this oxidative process is the lower reaction temperature and the less coke formation because of the oxygen addition. However, the excessive oxidation might lead to lower hydrogen yield compared to SR process. (4) CH3CH2OH+1.8H2O+0.6O2→4.8H2+2CO2 OSR of ethanol, being an integration of SR and POX, constitutes a reasonable compromise between energy efficiency and hydrogen yield. Oxygen from the feed might provide the heat necessary for the endothermic ethanol SR due to the exothermic oxidation of partial ethanol [26–28]. Thus, with a stoichiometric feed (ethanol/water/oxygen=1/1.8/0.6), the overall reaction can be thermally neutral (ΔH°298=+4.4kJ/mol) and hydrogen concentration can approach ~70mol% in the outlet dry stream [29]. This indicates that ethanol OSR not only provides a favorable energetic balance, but leads to a reasonably high hydrogen yield. Moreover, the presence of oxygen also facilitates the efficient removal of carbon deposition formed during the course of reaction. Both the selected reaction conditions (such as reaction temperature, residence time, feed composition) and types of catalyst are important control parameters for hydrogen production from ethanol. In favor of hydrogen yield, high temperature, long residence time and high stream (oxygen)/ethanol ratio are required. Thermodynamic analysis of ethanol SR process shows high values of equilibrium constant for temperature above 323°C and an increase in temperature prevents methane formation (the main byproduct consuming H atom) [30]. Increasing space time enhances the ethanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity together with the decline of the intermediates formation [31]. In general, an increase in water in the reactants favors the ethanol conversion and H2 production. The increase of CO2 concentration together with the decline of CO implied that adding water also accelerated WGS reaction. The presence of oxygen in the feed might promote the initial ethanol conversion. However, H2 concentration declined due to the partial oxidation. Moreover, the coke formation significantly declines with the increase in H2O/ethanol or O2/ethanol ratios considering the contribution of the carbon gasification by H2O or O2. Catalysts play a crucial role in terms of complete ethanol conversion and maximizing the hydrogen yield. Several metallic active phases mainly Ni, Co and noble metals such as Rh, Ru, Pt, Pd and Ir have been widely investigated considering that all these metals possess high C–C bond cleavage capacity, which is an indispensable function for ethanol conversion [32–38]. Besides the active metal, the support, if it exists, can interact with ethanol and accelerate its transformation, thus influencing the catalyst activity. Support may also promote H2O and/or O2 splitting that are critical for coke removal. Moreover, support–metal interfaces provide highly active sites for reactions of C–C and C–H bonds [39]. It has been indicated that support acting as a anchor efficiently stabilizes the metal particles in highly dispersed metal catalysts [40]. Note however that catalyst deactivation, the loss of catalytic activity and/or selectivity over time, is a problem of great and continuing concern in hydrogen production from ethanol. Hence, in addition to summarize the recent catalyst development, this feature article also stresses the many different parameters that lead to catalyst deactivation such as active metal sintering, coke formation, impurity in crude bio-ethanol as well as active metal oxidation [41–43]. Several different strategies to improve catalyst stability have also been elucidated including catalyst modification (e.g., promoter addition) and tuning ethanol/water or ethanol/oxygen ratios in order to establish a dynamic equilibrium between the coke formation and its gasification over the catalyst surface. Over the past decade, most of papers dedicated to the ethanol reforming are mainly focused on the development of active catalysts with high hydrogen yield and stability [44–48]. On the contrary, in depth studies combining a mechanistic and a kinetic analysis of the reaction, as well as catalyst deactivation are scarcely addressed, probably because of the complexity of the reaction and its strong reliance on the investigated catalysts [49]. Hence, an advanced knowledge of the reaction pathways which is also mainly considered in this review article is fundamental for designing optimized catalysts involved in the hydrogen production from ethanol [50–53]. Infrared spectroscopy (IR), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) under unsteady-state and steady state reaction conditions, which are in essence in situ techniques, have been employed to identify the main reaction routes and the corresponding intermediates and products. These investigations might also provide kinetic data for the reactions of ethanol. Hence, the principle of this feature review is to firstly highlight the recent catalyst development in ethanol reforming (including active metals and oxide supports). Moreover, good progress in mechanism investigation and kinetic analysis, as well as catalyst deactivation has also been examined. A fundamental understanding of the above parameters is expected to direct the development of highly efficient catalyst system for renewable hydrogen production."
1,Catalyst development,"As the heart of ethanol reforming is the surface reaction, the general requirements for catalytic surfaces are: (i) break the C–C bond to produce CO x (CO and/or CO2) and CH4 rather than promote the C–O bond activation; (ii) reform these C1 intermediates (CO, CH4) to generate H2 and CO2; (iii) activate water/oxygen to produce highly mobile oxygen and to inhibit coke formation. Based on the above considerations, active metals mainly facilitated the C–C bond cleavage and the diffusion/transformation of the intermediates took place over the metal–support interface [54,55]. Activation of water or oxygen is mainly occurred over the support to supply mobile oxygen species for coke gasification. Support’s acidity/alkalinity and redox property greatly influences the reaction selectivity/stability and is largely responsible for the occurrence of side reactions [56,57]. Support might also stabilize the active metal particles during the reaction process [58]. To date, development of a highly active, stable and coke-resistant catalyst has been extensively undertaken. However, there is still no commonly accepted optimal catalyst with excellent performance as well as low cost. The catalyst systems developed in the previous investigations can be generally classified into two categories, i.e., supported noble and non-noble metal catalysts. In the following part, we discussed the recently catalyst development in separate sections devoted to active metal and support."
2,Active metal,"2.1 Active metal Both transition metals and noble metals have been widely examined for ethanol reforming in developing the efficient catalyst systems. The general observation is that noble metals are normally more active and selective than transition metals, which is in line with methane reforming where noble metal catalysts are characterized by high reaction rate and less coke deposition [59]. 2.1.1 Noble metals Supported noble metal catalysts such as Rh, Ru, Pd and Pt have been extensively investigated for ethanol reforming process [60–66]. Among them, Rh based catalysts proved to be the most active systems due to the fact that Rh had the greatest capacity toward C–C bond dissociation which attributing to the following two parameters: (i) Different from other noble metals, a five-member ring oxametallacycle intermediate is formed over Rh surfaces after ethanol adsorption and the desorption of acetaldehyde is not favorable [67]; (ii) As to the C–C bond cleavage, the intrinsic barriers to the transfer of a molecular ligand (CH3–) is lower for Rh compared to Pt or Pd. Furthermore, the d electrons of Rh might be shared to a larger extent with the antibonding orbitals of ethoxides than those of other noble metals which is favorable for the bond dissociation [68]. Consequently, Rh based catalysts usually presents superior performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. A comparison of Al2O3-supported noble metal catalysts was conducted by several research groups as shown in Table 1. Specially, Rh sites resulted in several times more active than Pt, Pd, Ru and Au based catalysts. However, ethylene (C2H4) which is a strong coke precursor could be formed on acidic sites of Al2O3. The deactivation of Rh/Al2O3 catalyst caused by carbon deposition might be largely suppressed with O2 co-feeding, but O2 addition also induced the metal sintering because of the hot-spot [72,73]. In addition, the modification of Al2O3 by rare earth elements (Sc, Y, La, Er and Ga) significantly improved the catalytic behavior of Rh/Al2O3 catalyst (675°C, 2bar, C2H6O/H2O=1/4) [74]. This was mainly due to the increase of support alkalinity evidenced by infrared study of pyridine adsorption. The basic sites of the catalyst might prevent the formation of coke precursor (C2H4). Hence, Rh/Y2O3–Al2O3 catalyst with the strongest alkalinity exhibited the highest hydrogen yield (85%) and the less carbon deposition. The promotion effect has also been elucidated with the addition of the second active metal [74,75]. Kugai et al. [29] indicated that as to a novel NiRh/CeO2 catalyst, the addition of Ni was observed to increase the Rh dispersion. The smaller crystals of CeO2 support led to a stronger Rh–CeO2 interaction as well as a synergistic Ni–Rh interaction, thus resulting in higher catalytic performance. Additionally, the types of noble metals selected might affect the product selectivity [76]. As shown in Table 2, for the Al2O3 supported catalysts, ethanol preferred to be oxidized to acetaldehyde on Ag, Au and small amount of acetic acid was also observed on Pd, Ag probably due to their excellent oxidation capability. The previous investigations elucidated that the metals with lower d-band energy facilitated the rate of oxidation [77,78]. More ethanol dehydration occurred on Pd, Pt because their surfaces with stronger atomic O adsorptions (rather than C) were more likely to break the C–O bond instead of the C–C band of ethanol resulting in more ethylene formation [79]. In contrary, as discussed in [67,68], both a five-member ring oxametallacycle intermediate formed over Rh surfaces and the higher electric interaction with intermediates contributed to C–C bond dissociation, providing optimal hydrogen yield. Furthermore, an increase in H2O/ethanol or O2/ethanol ratios can also aid C–C bond cleavage to improve catalytic behavior. To date, Rh/CeO2 catalysts seemed to be the most active and stable system for ethanol reforming due to high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of CeO2 and the strong interaction between CeO2 and Rh [80,81]. In our previous studies [65], full ethanol conversion was even achieved at 400°C over an Rh/CeO2 catalyst with H2 yield as high as 98% at 650°C. No obvious deactivation was observed during 70h on-stream test at 650°C. The molar concentrations of H2, CO2, CO and CH4 in the outlet dry gas were stabilized at 67mol%H2, 18mol%CO, 8mol%CO2 and 7mol%CH4 respectively, without any acetaldehyde and acetone. The particle sizes of Rh species (around 1–3nm) were still highly dispersed on the CeO2 support after the aging test. Structural analysis of the aged catalysts indicated that the strong interaction between Rh and CeO2 efficiently prevented Rh particles sintering and the high oxygen storage capacity of CeO2 established a dynamic equilibrium between the coke formation and its gasification over the catalyst surface. Ir based catalysts have been recently demonstrated to be very active for ethanol reforming because of a strong interaction between Ir and supports as well as the optimal C–C bond cleavage capacity of Ir sites [82–86]. Siang et al. [66] investigated ethanol SR over Ir/CeO2 catalysts and found full ethanol conversion was achieved at around 450 oC with the H2 yield (H2 mole/ethanol mole) exceeded 5 as well as less content of CO and CH4 (<2%). Chen et al. [83] demonstrated that Ir/La2O3 catalyst efficiently prevented the methane formation and 3.4mol H2 could be obtained during ethanol OSR process. No obvious deactivation was observed for 4h on stream test. Chen et al. also [87] indicated that a complete ethanol conversion with ca. 80% hydrogen yield was obtained over a Ir/La2O3 catalyst in ethanol OSR at 650°C. (5) La2O3+CO2→La2O2CO3 The in situ formed La2O2CO3 species (Eq. (5)) tended to inhibit carbon deposition compared to Ir/Al2O3 catalyst because the surface carbon easily reacted with the formed La2O2CO3 intermediate species (Eq. (6)). (6) La2O2CO3+C→La2O3+2CO In this way, the coke deposit over Ir surfaces was timely removed resulting in the observed excellent stability. Moreover, the dynamic formation and decomposition of Ir-doped La2O2CO3 in situ delivered and dispersed Ir metal particles preventing their sintering during the course of reaction, as follows: (7) Ir0+La2O2CO3→Ir-doped La2O2CO3 (8) Ir-doped La2O2CO3 →Ir+La2O3+CO2 During the decomposition of the Ir-doped La2O2CO3, the La2O3/La2O2CO3 may act as a anchor to efficiently separate the Ir particles, thus inhibiting their sintering. As a consequence, Ir crystallite size was still maintained at ca. 3.2nm after 100h on stream test at 650°C even with high metal loading (9wt%). We have extensively investigated Ir/CeO2 catalysts for ethanol reforming as well which exhibited the compatible catalytic behavior with the Rh/CeO2 catalysts [88–94]. Under stoichiometric feed conditions of ethanol SR and OSR, 100% ethanol conversion was obtained for both processes even at 400°C as shown in Table 3. Upon heating to 500°C, no more byproducts such as acetaldehyde or acetone were formed and methane was further transformed into hydrogen and carbon oxides (CO and/or CO2). At 700°C, hydrogen concentration in the outlet dry gas was ca.74mol% for SR and 65mol% for OSR close to equilibrium values [89]. The turnover frequency (TOF) of Ir followed the order OSR (0.2S−1) ≥SR (0.06S−1). More importantly, Ir/CeO2 system also showed rather high stability in the temperature range of 550–650°C with full ethanol conversion during 60h on-stream test ( Fig. 1). 2.1.2 Transition metal Transition metals, especially Ni and Co, have been also widely studied for ethanol reforming, essentially because of their lower cost as compared to noble metals. Table 4 summarizes the main transition metal catalysts used in ethanol reforming [95–100]. Ni is industrially used for hydrogen production via methane reforming, which currently takes up about 80% of hydrogen capacity worldwide. For ethanol reforming, Ni based catalysts are characterized with high capacity for C–C bond dissociation and CH4 reforming. For instance, an acid-treated metallic Ni catalyst obtained from Ni sponge (rather than the Ni supported on some carriers) yielded 84% hydrogen selectivity and complete ethanol conversion above 650 oC with a feed composition of H2O/C2H5OH molar ratio of 10/1 [101], being almost equivalent to the value of an Rh/Al2O3 catalyst [69]. However, the greatest challenge for Ni based catalysts was the rapid deactivation due to heavy coke formation as well as Ni particles sintering. Several strategies such as modifying the support or Ni species were developed in order to improve the catalyst stability [102]. The addition of the dopants to the support is the routine way to prevent carbon deposition and Ni sintering. Vizcaino et al. [103] delayed ethylene formation through adding Mg to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst so as to neutralize the acid sites of the support. It was also indicated that the addition of K to the Ni/MgO catalyst greatly enhanced the catalyst stability by inhibiting the sintering of Ni particles without any effect on coke formation [104]. The modification of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with K also greatly reduced methane formation through inhibition of methanation reactions during ethanol SR process [105]. Another drawback for Ni based catalysts was the high CO concentration in the outlet gas due to the less activity of the WGS reaction. Fe was known to be an active metal for the WGS reaction. Furthermore, the electronic properties and ion radius of the Fe which was similar to that of Ni made it easily replace Ni. Based on the above statement, Huang et al. [78] observed the improved stability over the Fe-promoted Ni/Al2O3 system which was attributed to the synergistic effect of the NiAl2O4–FeAl2O4 mixed crystals that were more resistant to sintering and oxidation during ethanol OSR process. Alloying of Ni with other transition metals such as Cu, Fe, Co or noble metals (Pt, Pd) has also been explored to enhance the activity and stability via the synergetic effects [106–111]. In particular, a Ni–Cu bimetallic catalyst presented a higher H2 selectivity (98%) compared to the Ni catalyst (90%) and the better stability at 700°C with a feed stream of C2H6O/H2O/O2=1/1.6/0.68 [112]. The improved stability was attributed to the less coke formation via modifying the affinity of Ni particles for carbon by the addition of Cu. (9) CH3CH2OH→H2+CH3CHO Marino et al. [113] indicated that the addition of Cu might facilitate the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde (Eq. (9)), one of the important surface reaction intermediates during ethanol reforming. Cu is also more active in methane steam reforming to increase hydrogen yield. The promoting effect of noble metals contained both a decrease in the NiO reduction temperature because of the hydrogen spillover and the stabilization of metallic Ni sites along the reaction process [110,111]. Co is another mainly investigated transition metal catalyst considering it could break C–C bond at temperatures as low as 350–400°C [114–117]. Metallic Co obtained from Co3O4 reduction during the reaction was regarded as the active sites for ethanol SR process [118]. The previous studies elucidated that supported Co catalysts including Co/ZnO were promising alternatives in terms of activity and stability. Full ethanol conversion and 85% hydrogen selectivity was achieved even at 450 oC with a feed composition of C2H6O/H2O=1/10 (molar ratio). A periodical regeneration with mild oxidation has been proposed to resolve the problem of higher coke formation rate [119]. The key parameters was to precisely control the amount of oxygen avoiding the oxidation of hydrogen. The addition of Na to Co/ZnO catalyst improved the activity and stability via inhibiting carbon deposition over the catalyst surface [120]. The addition of alkaline earth metals as promoters might neutralize surface acidity, inhibiting coke deposition and increasing the fraction of exposed active metal surface after carbon deposition [121]. As to Co/CeO2 catalysts, Wang et al. [122] suggested that the preparation method influenced the interaction between Co species and CeO2 support. Co/CeO2 sample prepared by co-precipitation method was more active than that prepared by impregnation approach. Ethanol conversion was close to 100% and hydrogen yield reached ca. 70% at 450 oC without acetaldehyde or acetone formation. In order to promote Co-support interaction, fluorite-type Ce–Zr–Co oxide was synthesized and tested in ethanol SR process at 540°C with complete ethanol conversion and ca. 70mol% H2 in the outlet dry gas [123]. The addition of Rh to the CeZrCo sample might efficiently stabilize the catalyst by preventing the accumulation of carbon species on the catalyst surface [124]. Co/MgO was regarded as another type of active catalysts characterized with hydrogen yield of ca.70% at 400°C together with complete ethanol conversion [125]. As to the active sites, structural analysis revealed that Co0 sites were much more active for C–C bond cleavage and the WGS reaction compared to Co2+ species. Additionally, Karim et al. [126] also revealed that the higher concentration of Co0 species might be favorable for inhibiting methane formation. However, the drawback of the Co based catalysts is the readily deactivation caused by the sintering of Co particles and/or the surface oxidation of metallic Co species under reaction conditions. Several studies have evaluated to prolong the stability of Co based catalysts. For example, addition of Zn to Co/ZrO2 [127] and Rh or Ru to Co/SiO2 [128] prevented the oxidation of Co0 to some extents during the reaction, and the resulting higher Co0/Co2+ ratios in the catalysts significantly improved the catalytic durability. Moreover, small amounts of Fe (0.22wt%) in Co/Al2O3 sample exhibited the promising hydrogen yield and less coke formation in ethanol SR due to the strong interaction between Co and Fe [129]."
3,Oxide support,"2.2 Oxide support It has frequently been shown that the supports also play a critical role in the activity and stability of the catalyst for hydrocarbon or oxygenate reforming [130,131]. In this respect, support effects are often disguised by concomitant changes of the metal–support interaction, active metal crystallite size, reducibility and electronic structure [132,133]. Besides stabilizing metal species, support can also take part in the intermediate steps of ethanol conversion. For instance, support often contain sites for reactants adsorption [131]. Moreover, some support induce side reactions in ethanol reforming. Acid sites of Al2O3 are known to be active in ethylene formation (Eq. (10)), a common coke precursor [134]. (10) CH3CH2OH→H2O+C2H4 Numerous oxides such as CeO2, Al2O3, MgO, and ZrO2 have been investigated as a support for the metal phase in order to ensure optimal metallic dispersion and thermal stability but also to participate directly in the catalytic process [54,135–137]. Among them, Al2O3 is the most common support because of its strong mechanical and thermal stability under reaction conditions. However, the acidic sites on Al2O3 promoted ethanol dehydration to ethylene (Eq. (10)) that further polymerized to hard coke, resulting in a fast deactivation. Accordingly, modification of Al2O3 with basic promoter was typically adopted to neutralize the acid sites. For instance, the addition of Ca to Ni/Al2O3 greatly diminished the acidic OH groups, thus leading to less ethylene formation [138]. Sanchez et al. [139] elucidated that Ni/MgO–Al2O3 exhibited higher catalytic performance in comparison to Ni/Al2O3 sample because Mg dopants could suppress the surface acidity of Al2O3 support and modified the Ni–Al2O3 interaction which might improve the Ni dispersion. In order to avoid the acid sites, basic MgO is another frequent used support in ethanol reforming catalysts. It was observed that MgO supported Rh [140], Ni [141] and Co [125] catalysts were typically active for ethanol reforming, but the strong basic sites on MgO induced ethanol condensation to higher oxygenates, being precursors of coke [142]. Therefore, it is crucial to properly adjust the acidity and alkalinity of the oxide supports in order to maximize hydrogen yield and simultaneously obtain high catalyst stability. CeO2 characterized with redox property and strong metal–support interaction has been widely investigated as support in numerous studies of ethanol reforming considering that the surface oxygen and OH mobility on the support plays an important role in the reformation processes [143–145]. The promoter effect of CeO2 is related with the ability of (i) storing and releasing active oxygen due to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) which realizes the activation of water and/or oxygen; (ii) dispersing and stabilizing active metals via acting as a anchor. Both functions were greatly influenced by the quantity of the surface oxygen vacancies that was intimately associated with the size and shape of CeO2 particles. It has been evidenced that Ir/CeO2 catalysts are much more active and selective toward hydrogen production from ethanol and also characterized with extremely high stability [88–93]. This outstanding catalytic property is straightforwardly assigned to the intimate interaction between tiny Ir particles and CeO2 particles. Our previous studies also demonstrated that ethanol OSR process on the Ir/CeO2 catalysts was a structure sensitive reaction resulting in either a bi-functional or a mono-functional mechanism depending on the sizes of CeO2 particles [54]. By keeping the sizes of Ir particles in the range 2–4nm, an increase in the sizes of CeO2 particles from 6nm to 44nm had tremendous effect on the reaction performance, providing valuable information in understanding the role of CeO2 in ethanol reforming [53]. For CeO2 particles of 6nm in size, full ethanol conversion was obtained at 450°C with 67°mol% hydrogen in ethanol OSR even with a stoichiometric feed composition, but complete ethanol conversion was only obtained at 650°C with 40mol% hydrogen for the catalyst containing CeO2 particles of 44nm in size. During 60h on-stream test at 650°C, the former sample exhibited rather stable performance without obvious variations in ethanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity whereas the later catalyst was characterized with continuously decline of ethanol conversion from 100% to 95% and hydrogen concentration from 40mol% to 24mol%. Structural analysis revealed that the large CeO2 particles with less surface oxygen vacancies weakened the diffusion and surface reaction of the oxygenated ad-species and consequently suppressed ethanol conversion and hydrogen yield. Diffused Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFT) confirmed a progressive decline of the hydroxyl group concentration with increasing CeO2 particle size. Oxygen isotopic exchange also indicated similar trends in the change of the concentration of exchangeable oxygen indirectly related to surface defects. The decline of these parameters might prevent the diffusion of C2 intermediates towards the Ir–Ce interface to decompose into C1 products, resulting in the accumulation of significant amounts of acetaldehyde and ethylene. The turnover frequency (TOF, Fig. 2) calculated according to CeO2 particle sizes reaffirmed that the CeO2 surface determined by the particle size controlled the ethanol conversion rate. Concerning the observed difference of stability, for the catalyst supported on small CeO2 particles (6nm), a strong Ir–CeO2 interaction arising from the high concentration of CeO2 defects strongly anchored and effectively prevented Ir particles from sintering and consequently presented very stable reaction performance following a bi-functional mechanism. In contrast, for the catalyst using large CeO2 particles (44nm), the lack of surface defects inhibited any surface transfer and partial oxidation of the ethoxy species toward the Ir particles, favoring the side reactions such as acetaldehyde and ethylene formation over the surface of CeO2 support that further polymerize into coke. Only partial conversion of ethanol was observed in the initial period and continuous deactivation occurred during the whole test probably due to the combination effect of Ir particle sintering and the progressive poisoning of Ir and CeO2 by carbon deposits. Besides the influence of CeO2 particle, the morphology of CeO2 support may also play an important role in determining the catalytic properties. CeO2 has a cubic fluorite crystal structure with a cubic array of fourfold coordinated oxygen ions and cerium cations that occupy half of the eightfold coordinated cationic interstice. The (111) surface of CeO2 is terminated by threefold-coordinated oxygen atoms and sevenfold coordinated cerium atoms; the (110) surface is terminated by a CeO2 plane with threefold oxygen and sixfold cerium atoms; and the polar (100) surface is terminated by twofold-coordinated oxygen atoms [146,147]. Both experimental and theoretical studies have concluded that the (100) and (110) faces of CeO2 are generally more reactive than the (111) surface because the (100)- and (110)-dominated surfaces favor the migration of lattice oxygen atoms from the bulk to the surface; however, the process is restricted to the (111)-dominated surfaces [146,148–151]. This general principle raises the possibility of enhancing the OSC by tuning the shape of the CeO2 nanoparticles for exposing more reactive (110) and (100) facets [146]. Several prominent works on CeO2 supported catalysts for ethanol reforming supplied convincing experimental results and maintained a fundamental understanding of CeO2 function. When being used to support Rh nanoparticles, CeO2 nanorods and cubes which mainly exposed the (110) and (100) planes exhibited much higher initial hydrogen selectivity compared to the irregular CeO2 particles that dominantly exposed the (111) planes in ethanol OSR at 800 oC. As presented in Fig. 3, hydrogen selectivity in the initial period declined in according to the following order: Rh/CeO2-rod>Rh/CeO2-cube>Rh/CeO2-irregular. However, a small deactivation during 24h on stream was observed in all cases especially for Rh supported on nanorods and cubes. Their hydrogen selectivity decreased from 126% to 115% (rod) and 122% to 100% (cube), respectively. In contrast, Rh/CeO2-irregular sample was less sensitive to the duration of reaction and stabilized at 115%. The deactivation might be assigned to the support restructuring. Under the reaction conditions, CeO2 nanorods rapidly reshaped to rounded form and CeO2 cubes restructured to more spherical-like particles [148]. Another key issue such as flowerlike CeO2 with mesoporous structure was reported to be a promising support because of the effective diffusion of reactants and products. Flowerlike CeO2 microspheres possessed large surface area (90m2/g) and high thermal stability (up to 600°C) [147]. After Cu loading, the as-prepared catalyst not only exhibited much high hydrogen yield (75% at 550°C) in ethanol SR reaction, but presented remarkable stability [152]. Similarly, Ni particles supported on flowerlike CeO2 also showed the satisfied ethanol conversion (95%) and hydrogen selectivity (83%) even at 350°C [153,154]. The observed excellent catalytic properties of flowerlike CeO2 support were attributed to its open 3D porous structure, which possessed the high surface area, large pore volume beneficial for gas transport as well as thermal stability. However, one of the major challenges for CeO2 application is its deactivation due to the loss of surface area at high reaction temperature, which in turn reduced its redox properties [155–157]. Doping of CeO2 with other oxides is an efficient approach to enhance its thermal stability and redox property [158–161]. For instance, the presence of Zr in Ce x Zr1−x O2 stabilized the CeO2 lattice, improving its thermal stability and oxygen storage capacity (OSC), thus leading to better catalytic behavior [162,163]. Mg-modified Ni/CeO2 catalysts possessed higher OSC and smaller Ni crystallite size compared with bare Ni/CeO2, which promoted hydrogen yield and inhibited coke formation [164]. PrO x -doping (Ce0.9Pr0.1O2, 6nm in size) has also greatly increased oxygen storage capacity from 1689μmolO/g cat to 2170μmolO/g cat [94]. The enriched surface oxygen defects ensured facile activation of H2O and/or O2 molecules as well as fast surface diffusion of mobile oxygen species, accelerating the transformation rate of the intermediates and also inhibiting the coke formation. As shown in Fig. 4, over a model Ir/CeO2 catalyst, ethanol conversion decreased from 100% to 62% and the corresponding H2 concentration declined from 61mol% to 55mol% after 300h on-stream test in ethanol SR. However, under the same reaction conditions on the Ir/Ce0.9Pr0.1O2 catalyst, ethanol conversion only marginally decreased from 100% to 95% and H2 concentration stabilized without obvious change during the whole run. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) measurements of the aged samples revealed that the amounts of deposited carbon were 11.8 and 4.5mgC/g cat on the Ir/CeO2 and Ir/Ce0.9Pr0.1O2 catalysts, respectively. High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) analysis also indicated that the CeO2 particles reshaped into irregular polygonal crystallites in the aged Ir/CeO2 sample, which weakened the Ir–CeO2 interaction and declined the water activation capacity. In contrast, for the used Ir/Ce0.9Pr0.1O2 catalyst, the size and shape of the Ce0.9Pr0.1O2 particles were well retained, thus guaranteeing the exceptionally high activity and stability. In general, redox supports such as CeO2 and CeO2–MO x mixed oxides have been found to be highly favorable for hydrogen production from ethanol reforming. A strong interaction between metal and CeO2 was the fact responsible for the presence of highly dispersed metal particles through suppressing their sintering. During reaction process, gaseous O2 and/or H2O molecules easily transferred to the solid CeO2 surface via the quick and reversible redox between Ce4+ and Ce3+. This activation capacity for O2 and/or H2O was referred to as the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [146]. The formed mobile oxygen easily reacted with the coke, preventing catalyst deactivation. High oxygen defects related with oxygen diffusion ability and OSC in CeO2 facilitated ethanol adsorption and O2/H2O activation, simultaneously accelerating CO oxidation and water gas shift reaction (WGS) to minimize CO formation. In the presence of O2 and/or H2O, CeO2 support vacancies might be replenished, which ensured the carbon removal operating efficiently. Hence, a dynamic equilibrium between the coke formation and its gasification on the CeO2 supported catalyst was established guaranteeing catalyst stability."
4,Mechanistic understanding of ethanol reforming,"Recently, different mechanistic schemes for ethanol reforming have been proposed in order to shed light on the real ethanol coanversion over the catalyst surface [165–169]. However, there still has no consensus on the detailed reaction pathways due to the complexities in largely varied catalyst’s constituents and reaction conditions (such as reaction temperature, feed composition and residence time). The generally acknowledged reaction steps (as shown in Fig. 5) primarily include: Ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde (Eq. (9)) Ethanol decomposition to CH4, CO and H2: (11) CH3CH2OH→CH4+CO+H2 Acetaldehyde decomposition to CH4 and CO: (12) CH3CHO→CH4+CO Methane steam reforming: (13) CH4+H2O→CO+3H2 Water gas shift (WGS, Eq. (2)) However, many other side reactions, catalytic or not, largely depending on the properties of the active metal and the support might also occur, thus resulting in coke formation and less hydrogen yield [170–172]. Possible side reactions involved can be as follows: Ethanol dehydration to ethylene (Eq. (10) Ethylene polymerization to coke: (14) C2H4→coke Acetone formation via acetaldehyde condensation, followed by decarboxylation: (15) 2CH3CHO→CH3COCH3+CO+H2 Methane cracking: (16) CH4→C+2H2 Boudouard reaction: (17) 2CO→CO2+C (Boudouard reaction) Reverse of carbon gasification: (18) CO+H2→H2O+C Therefore, an advanced knowledge of the reaction mechanism is fundamental for the improvement of catalyst formulations and processes. It has been frequently shown that both the nature of the metal and the support selected greatly affect the final product distributions. Sheng et al. [67] investigated the influence of active metal on the ethanol conversion pathways by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in steady state conditions. As presented in Fig. 6, adsorbed ethanol was dissociated to form ethoxides species that were further oxidized to give acetaldehyde on Pt or Pd metals. In contrast, a different pathway was observed on Rh species. Ethoxide species lost one H atom from the terminal (methyl) group and were thus adsorbed in a cyclic configuration onto the surface (a five-membered-ring oxametallacycle intermediate) [173]. The decomposition of this species would produce CO and CH4 upon further annealing. The addition of Pt to Rh based catalyst further promoted the hydrogen formation because Pt metal accelerated methane transformation into hydrogen. Yee et al. [68] also elucidated that Rh reduced the intrinsic activation barrier for C–C bond dissociation more compared to Pd or Pt. Additionally, the d electrons of Rh was shared to a larger extent with the antibonding orbitals of ethoxides than those of Pd and Pt, thus leading to the higher capacity of C–C bond cleavage. They also observed the lowest CO to CO2 ratios over Au/CeO2 catalyst compared to the value of Pt/CeO2 sample suggesting the higher rate of WGS reaction on Au based catalyst [173]. Basagiannis et al. [174] revealed that Rh presented the highest H2 selectivity while Ru promoted the acetaldehyde formation. Methane selectivity declined in the following order: Pd≈Pt>Rh≥Ru. Liguras et al. [70] studied the effect of active metals supported on the same Al2O3 support. H2 selectivity declined in the following order: Rh≥Pt>Ru≈Pd while acetaldehyde selectivity followed the reverse order. Furthermore, both dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and dehydration to ethylene were significantly determined by support properties. Generally, a high basic site number, a small metal cation-oxygen anion bond energy, a small Madelung potential of O anion, and a high oxygen electronic polarisability of the support was favorable for dehydrogenation rather than dehydration [68,175–177]. In our previous studies [27], three different types of catalysts (Ni–Cu/SiO2, Rh/Al2O3 and Ir/CeO2) were investigated for ethanol reforming. Both the product distributions obtained from TPD and the surface intermediates identified during DRIFT analysis deferred largely for these catalysts, implying distinguish reaction mechanism ( Table 5). The detailed pathways were described in the following section."
5,Mono-functional mechanism,"3.1 Mono-functional mechanism A single functional mechanism was observed over the Ni–Cu/SiO2 catalyst. The main reactions of adsorbed ethanol and intermediate species occurred on the Ni sites. The function of SiO2 support was just to guaranty the well dispersion of the active metal (Ni and Cu) particles rather than directly participate in the reaction network. In agreement with the above statement, the first step involved the formation of ethoxy species on Ni sites. Upon heating, the Ni surface became more active for C–C bond dissociation into C1 species. It has been evidenced that the synergistic effect between Ni and Cu might efficiently improve the catalyst performance [178]. The addition of Cu significantly promoted Ni redox cycles (involving changes in the state of Ni, from hydroxide to oxide then to metal and vice-versa) that was crucial for the transformation of ethanol and intermediate species. The Ni–Cu alloy phase was also helpful for the activation of CO and water, leading to the larger production of CO2 compared to the Ni/SiO2 sample. (19) Cu−OH+Ni=CO→HCOO−Cu/Ni (20) HCOO−Cu/Ni→H−Cu/Ni+CO2"
6,Bi-functional mechanism,"3.2 Bi-functional mechanism As compared to Ni–Cu/SiO2 sample, a bi-functional mechanism was elucidated over the Rh/Al2O3 and Ir/CeO2 catalysts. Dehydrogenation mainly occurred on the support and the decomposition reactions took place on the metal–support interface. For the Rh/Al2O3 sample, the hydroxyl groups from the Al2O3 support contributed to the formation of ethoxy species: (21) CH3CH2OH+Al−OH+Al3+→CH3CH2O−Al+H2O−Al Increasing temperature resulted in the formation of adsorbed C1 species via ethoxy species decomposition which tentatively occurred at the Rh–Al2O3 interface: (22) CH3CH2O−Al+4Rh→CH3−Rh+CO−Rh +2H−Rh+Al A portion of ethoxy species might undergo dehydration to produce ethylene: (23) CH3CH2O−Al→C2H4+Al−OH One interesting point was that CO2 formation on the Rh/Al2O3 catalyst came from the decomposition of carbonate species (obtained from acetate species reacting with OH groups of the support) rather than the decomposition of formate species and acetate species occurring on the Ni–Cu/SiO2 sample. The observed better capacity for water gas shift reaction (Eq. (2)) was attributed to the larger electronic interaction between metal–CO and hydroxyl groups on Rh sites compared to other metals. A specialty for the Ir/CeO2 sample compared to the investigated Ni–Cu/SiO2 and Rh/Al2O3 catalysts was the acetone formation from acetaldehyde. The reaction occurred as follows: Acetaldehyde condensation: (24) 2CH3CHO→CH3CH(OH)CH2CHO CeO2 support provided lattice oxygen to form C4 intermediate: (25) CH3CH(OH)CH2COO(s)+O(s)→CH3CH(OH)CH2COO(s)+H(s) Dehydrogenation and decarboxylation of the intermediate to form acetone: (26) CH3CH(OH)CH2COO(s)+H(s)→CH3COCH3+CO2+H2 IR spectra of adsorbed ethanol on bare CeO2 and Ir/CeO2 sample indicated that the bands assigned to ethoxy species were observed in the range of 1100–1200cm−1 over the two investigated catalysts even at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 7, some of ethoxy species might further undergo dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde reacting with surface hydroxyl groups on CeO2 to form acetate species [168]. This indicated that the dissociation of ethanol and the reaction of adsorbed ethoxy species were easily preceding steps and simultaneously occurred on CeO2 surface. Hence, ethanol conversion proceeded according to the following sequence: ethanol→ethoxy species→acetaldehyde→acetate species, i.e., represented mainly C2 chemistry over CeO2 surface. In contrast, carbonate species were formed over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst, a little difference with pure CeO2. Acetate species decomposed into methyl groups and carbonate species at the Ir–CeO2 interface, which represented a transition from C2 to C1 products. The formed methyl groups were further reformed or oxidized to carbonyl species, releasing CO, over the Ir surface representing the conventional C1 chemistry on noble metals. Besides the effect of active metal and support, ethanol OSR on Ir/CeO2 catalysts was also demonstrated as a structure sensitive reaction, leading to either an effective bi-functional or a mono-functional mechanism depending on the domains of CeO2 [54]. CO2 TPD/calorimetry, in situ DRIFT spectroscopy, and oxygen isotopic exchange techniques revealed that CeO2 support not only oxidized ethanol into acetaldehyde/acetate species, but provided the OH groups and mobile oxygen to the Ir/ceria interface so as to ensure the diffusion/cracking of the C2 intermediates species and coke cleaning ( Fig. 8). The surface diffusion of acetate species and their decomposition at the Ir–CeO2 interface sites were believed to be the overall rate-limiting steps of ethanol OSR process. Other steps dealing with initial ethanol adsorption and final syngas desorption were considered not to control the overall reaction rate. For the sample with the moderate sintering of CeO2, a strong surface alkalinity linked to a high concentration of surface defects ensured efficient H2O/O2 activation and diffusion of adspecies toward the Ir particles. In addition, the sufficient Ir–CeO2 interfacial sites allowed the cracking of C2 adspecies and their transfer into C1 species according to an effective bi-functional process. A significant Ir–CeO2 interaction arising from the high concentration of CeO2 defects efficiently prevented the Ir sintering. However, the sample with more sintering CeO2 proceeded essentially along a mono-functional mechanism. The lack of surface defects inhibited the surface migration of the adspecies along the CeO2 surface and their sequential oxidation, which resulted in the formation of side products on the weaker basic CeO2 surface such as acetaldehyde and the dehydration of ethoxy species into ethylene resulting in coke formation [54]."
7,Kinetic analysis,"Most of papers dedicated to ethanol reforming mainly focused on the development of high efficient catalyst and the elucidation of reaction pathways. In contrast, in depth studies on kinetic models remained extremely scarce [179–183]. It is well known that the design of catalysts and reactors requires the information on the kinetic properties of the reaction of interest. Recently, several research groups have studied the kinetics of the ethanol reforming process over various metal catalysts [184–187]. Vaidya et al. [184] conducted a kinetic study over a commercial Ru/Al2O3 catalyst in a conventional fixed bed reactor and indicated the apparent orders of 1 and 0 for ethanol and water, respectively, and an apparent activation energy of 96±17kJ/mol. Graschinsky et al. [185] made a more advanced kinetic study of ethanol SR over an RhMgAl2O4/Al2O3 sample indicating that two kinds of active sites were involved in the rate determining step. Furthermore, a reaction order of 0.5 with respect to ethanol and an activation energy of 4.4kJ/mol were recently reported for ethanol SR over Pd/CeO2 catalyst [186]. An overall activation energy of 85kJ/mol and reaction orders of 1.2 for ethanol and 0 for water in ethanol SR have been reported for a Rh/Pt washcoated monolith catalyst [187]. The apparent activation energy of reaction can be computed to be 32.5kJ/mol for ethanol OSR over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst developed in our group. In spite of the different temperature range, an activation energy (39.3kJ/mol) using a Pt–Ni/Al2O3 sample [111] was similar to the value obtained on the Ir/CeO2 catalyst. To date, less relationship has been established between the kinetic parameters (e.g., rate of conversion or selectivity, rate constants, reaction orders, activation energies etc) and the structure morphology of the catalysts, which might be a challenge for the future research."
8,Catalyst deactivation,"The development of stable catalysts is one of the most important issues in the hydrogen production from ethanol, particularly with stoichiometric feed composition where no excess H2O and/or O2 is available to remove carbon deposits that are detrimental to the catalytic stability. Regardless of the metal and support used, stability is still one of the main challenges for the catalysts design in ethanol reforming. On the basis of the published papers, the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation might be mainly grouped into four intrinsic types: (i) coke formation; (ii) sintering of active metal; (iii) oxidation of active metal; (iv) poisoning. The more detailed analysis for catalyst deactivation was reviewed in the following section."
9,Coke formation,"5.1 Coke formation Carbon deposition is normally derived from the secondary reactions of the intermediates and the products, whose formation is closely associated with the nature of the catalysts. Several reactions are proposed to account for the coke formation (Eq. (14), Eqs. (16)–(18). Apart from the catalyst chemical properties, the extent of the above reactions significantly relied on the reaction temperature. Lower temperature (below 400 oC) facilitated the carbon deposition via the Boudouard reaction (Eq. (17)) and the reverse of carbon gasification (Eq. (18)). In contrast, methane decomposition reaction (Eq. (16)) became the dominant process at higher reaction temperature (above 600°C). The types of the accumulated carbon greatly dependent on the nature of the active metal selected and the reaction conditions. Filamentous carbon was usually observed over transition metal (Ni, Co) catalysts. Frusteri et al. [188] indicated that carbon filaments were normally formed via carbon precipitation after diffusion through Ni or Co particles. The continuous precipitation finally resulted in carbon filaments and simultaneously lifted up the Ni or Co particles off the support surfaces, thus losing the catalytic activity. With respect to the noble metal-based catalysts, there was no carbon diffusion over noble metals and resulted in amorphous carbon formation which encapsulated the active metal sites and blocked the support surface. The deactivation of an Rh/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst was traced back to the accumulation of carbonaceous species [189] and/or the significant build-up of reaction intermediates, in particular acetone and ethylene [190]. It was reported that the aldol condensation of acetone formed diacetone alcohol, which further underwent dehydration to mesityl oxide [191]. Takanabe et al. [192] revealed that the oligomerization of mesityl oxide resulted in the coke formation. Ir/CeO2 catalysts have been demonstrated to be highly active for ethanol reforming, but the insufficient transformation of the reaction intermediates often resulted in coke deposition [193]. Aging analyses on Ir/CeO2 catalyst identified that the rapid loss in activity during the initial 5h was probably attributed to the fast deposition of soft carbon on the catalyst surface, which was produced from the unconverted C2 intermediates. As presented in Fig. 9, after 5h reaction, the size of the Ir particles was around 6nm, being almost the same as the reduced one, but a thin layer of amorphous carbon deposit was obviously observed on the catalyst surface and some of the Ir particles were covered by the carbon deposits. In fact, the build-up of unconverted reaction intermediates (such as acetaldehyde, acetate species, and acetone) is frequently observed in ethanol reforming. For instance, the highly stable acetate species adsorbed on the support inhibited the diffusion and decomposition of ethoxy species [194]. Guil et al. [195] elucidated that the blockage of the activate sites by acetaldehyde, which was further polymerized to carbonaceous species, was observed over a Co/ZnO catalyst. Deactivation study of a Rh/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst revealed that the accumulation of acetone and ethylene caused more fast deactivation compared to acetaldehyde and acetic acid [196]. Therefore, the polymerization of the C2 intermediates, which was built up along the CeO2 surface might lead to hard carbon formation and its accumulation became prominent after 20h. The formed hard carbon would gradually encapsulate the CeO2 particles and probably the Ir ones, thus hindering progressively the adsorption of ethanol from the gas phase to the CeO2 surface and the diffusion of C2 intermediates from CeO2 to the Ir particles, which resulted in a slow deactivation."
10,Active metal sintering,"5.2 Active metal sintering In addition to coke formation, sintering of the active metal particles is another main cause for the catalyst deactivation during ethanol reforming. Sintering is a process wherein the active metallic nanoparticles agglomerated and declined the number of the surface active sites [197]. This change was typically irreversible and the original activity of the catalyst was difficult to be restored. Both the presence of water and increasing reaction temperature promoted the sintering rate [198]. For instance, obvious Ir sintering (from 5 to 50nm) was observed over an Ir/Al2O3 sample, which was one of the main reasons for the catalyst deactivation [87]. Adding oxygen to the feed assisted in the removal of coke over a Rh/Al2O3 catalyst but simultaneously induced Rh sintering because of the hot spot (particle sizes increased from 2–3nm to ca.9nm) [72,73]. This enlargement of Rh particles caused ethanol conversion declined from 100% to 85%. Generally, sintering of Ni particles is more significant compared to Rh and Ir particles. As expected, large Ni species (80nm) exhibited much less hydrogen yield compared to the catalyst with smaller Ni sintering (9nm) [199]. In addition to metal sintering, thermal deactivation problems also involved the catalyst restructuring during the reaction. Upon heating, chemical properties of the catalysts severely changed or may even totally collapse. For instance, structural change in a CeZrCoRh catalyst under ethanol SR conditions significantly decreased the support redox capacity [200]. At typical reaction temperatures (400–500°C) for ethanol SR, hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Co sites that were exclusively active for hydrogen production was transformed into much less active face-centered cubic (fcc) Co species [201]."
11,Active metal oxidation,"5.3 Active metal oxidation In the ethanol POX or OSR processes, the presence of oxygen might result in the oxidation of the metallic species, thus leading to catalyst deactivation. Pereira et al. [128] studied the ethanol OSR over Co/SiO2 catalyst. Adding oxygen might be expected to oxidize the metallic Co particles, which favored the production of acetaldehyde, inhibiting its further reformation under reaction conditions. The addition of noble metals such as Ru or Rh might prevent oxidation of Co0 sites, leading to the higher ratio of Co0/Co2+ because of the intimate contact between Co and the noble metal phases. Van T Bilk et al. [202] reported that although the bimetallic clusters were thermodynamically unstable, the rate of segregation of metal oxides might be slow. Silva et al. [203] also observed the catalyst deactivation due to the oxidation of metallic Co species by oxygen from the feed. The smaller Co particles were more susceptible to be oxidized during ethanol OSR conditions compared to the larger ones."
12,Influence of ethanol impurity,"5.4 Influence of ethanol impurity To date, studies reported in the literature on ethanol reforming mainly focused on the use of a mixture of water and pure ethanol. In contrast, the use of crude bio-ethanol was remain scarce [204–206]. The use of a raw ethanol feed without the purification step, was of major importance for a cost industrial application. However, the crude bio-ethanol contained various impurities, mainly higher alcohols, with minor acids, aldehydes, ethers, esters, which might lead to the catalyst deactivation. For instance, higher alcohols containing in the raw bio-ethanol might poison the catalyst and drastically decrease the catalyst stability due to coke formation. Dehydration of these impurities led to olefin, which was the precursor of the coke. The influence of the higher alcohols became more pronounced as increasing the alcohol chain length (more coke formation as more carbon atoms in the olefin) and the branched alcohols caused more severe deactivation than the linear ones because they could produce more stable carbonaceous species [204]. Another possible reason for catalyst deactivation was that the lipophilic nature of the higher alcohols might lead to the catalyst surface more hydrophobic and then prevent the adsorption of water and ethanol. Le Valant et al. [207] investigated the effect of impurities in bio-ethanol for ethanol SR over Rh/MgAl2O4 catalyst. It was reported that the presence of methanol, aldehyde, and amine had no negative effect on the catalytic behavior. However, the existence of acid, ester, or higher alcohols was responsible for catalyst deactivation because of the carbon deposition. While catalyst deactivation was inevitable and more difficult to avoid, several different approaches have been developed to slow down the deactivation such as increasing water concentration in the feed, O2 addition, catalyst modification by adding dopants. Lima et al. [169] reported that high H2O/ethanol ratios improved hydrogen selectivity and catalyst stability. Furthermore, oxygen from the feed might accelerate the coke gasification, thus resulting in the remarkable stability. As to the problem of metal sintering, no obvious Ni sintering was observed over an Al modified Ni/MgO catalyst even under severe aging conditions (900°C) probably due to the formation of Ni–Al solid solution [208]. The resulting Ni–Al/MgO catalyst was applied as the anode of a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) and stably ran 2000h without significant deactivation. Another adopted strategy was to use high surface area support in order to maintain a sufficient distance between metal crystallites and simultaneously providing barriers to metal particle diffusion. For instance, the sizes of Pt particles supported on Al2O3 only slightly increased to ca.3nm even after the aging at 800°C because of the retention of high surface area support [209]. Based on the challenge that the conventional fixed-bed reactors might hardly meet the process requirements for rapid and frequent load changes in small scale and mobile hydrogen production, various types of micro-structured reactors have been developed in order to fulfill the miniaturization and compactness requirements [210–212]. In addition to compactness, micro-reactor presented the other advantages such as (i) the rapid heat and mass transfer coefficients due to high surface to volume ratio; (ii) the lower pressure drop compared to conventional packed bed reactors since micro-reactors work under laminar flow conditions; (iii) providing built-in safety since a large gas hold-up (reactor volume) is avoided [86]. Several publications also focused on the ethanol reforming in membrane reactor for pure hydrogen production [213–215]. Membrane reactors combined catalytic reactions and H2 separation through membranes in a single unit, thus resulting in a high degree of process intensification, with accompanying benefits in terms of low cost and high energy efficiency [213]."
13,Concluding remarks,"Over the past decade, hydrogen production from renewable sources such as ethanol has attracted significant attention in sustainable energy development. Among the various reaction routes, ethanol OSR is envisioned as a highly efficient process because of thermal neutral and relatively higher hydrogen yield. During ethanol OSR reaction, the thermally neutral operation conditions can be obtained through the adjusting of feed composition, which might preclude the need for and external heat supply. To date, most of the studies on ethanol reforming mainly focused on catalyst configuration. It has been indicated that both the active metal and the support play a critical role in the activity and stability of the catalyst. Metals such as Ni, Co, Rh, Ir, and Ru have been found to exhibit reasonable intrinsic activity for ethanol reforming. Among them, Rh based catalysts are regarded as the most active systems due to its superior C–C bond cleavage capacity. Furthermore, numerous oxides such as CeO2, Al2O3, MgO, and ZrO2 have been investigated as a support for the metal phase in order to ensure optimal metallic dispersion and stability but also to participate directly in the catalytic process. CeO2 and CeO2–MO x mixed oxides were considered as the suitable supports because of its redox property and strong metal–support interaction. In addition to stabilize the metal particles, a dynamic equilibrium between the coke formation and its gasification on the CeO2 supported catalyst was established guaranteeing catalyst stability. Besides the operating conditions, both the nature of metal and the support significantly affected the reaction pathways proceeding along the mono-functional or bi-functional mechanism. Dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and/or dehydration to ethylene were mainly determined by support properties. Metal–support interface sites controlled the diffusion and transformation of the intermediate species. Meanwhile, decomposition mainly occurred on the active metal surface. Intrinsic mechanism of catalyst deactivation are generally classified into the following types: (i) coke formation; (ii) active metal sintering and/or oxidation; (iii) impurities in the crude bio-ethanol. Several strategies have been successfully developed to resolve or slow down the deactivation, for instance, increasing the water/ethanol ratio, O2 co-feeding as well as catalyst modification through promoter addition. Up to now, the main investigations normally conducted at high temperature, typically 500–800°C. Hence, lower-temperature reforming of ethanol with excellent activity and selectivity is highly expected in view of the energy efficiency, which greatly relies on the development of new catalysts and process design. Furthermore, both in situ catalyst characterizations to elucidate the catalyst deactivation and the kinetic understanding of ethanol conversion (from low to high temperatures, in the absence and in the presence of co-reactants like water and oxygen) are also crucial aspects to be investigated. It is anticipated to achieve further developments of these systems in the future research. Hopefully, more fundamental understanding of ethanol conversion at the molecular level would greatly benefit for an efficient catalytic reactor on industrial scale."
