0,Introduction,"In the process of synthesis or application of alcohols, water always presents the coexistence relationships with alcohols. In the stage of synthesis of alcohols, water exists as a reactant or side product. The alcohols are conventionally produced from hydration of their corresponding alkenes, such as isobutylene for tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) [1], propylene for isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and by-product n-propanol [2], etc. In terms of applications, TBA can be etherified with glycerol to produce fuel oxygenates for diesel fuels, while by-producing water. Excessive ethanol can be used for producing of ethyl acetate, also water existed into the mixtures [3]. IPA or ethanol was applied to clean the electric circuit in the process of the electronic industry [4]. The subsequent separation of homogenous mixtures composed of one or more alcohols and water to obtain high purity products or to treat industrial wastewater containing abundant alcohols has attracted widespread attention [5]. However, the separation of alcohols from water suffers a difficulty due to their close-boiling points and the formation of azeotropic mixtures. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a cleaner and efficient process for the alcohols/water separation. Due to the enhancing on vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) of alcohols to water, homogeneous extractive distillation had widely considered as a promising process for separation of alcohols-water mixtures [6,7]. The key steps of this method are the screening of the optimal entrainers both in energy and economic perspectives. Multiscale analysis methods were used to screen organic solvent or ionic liquids (ILs) entrainers, which presented the quantum chemistry calculation, VLE of experimental measurements or COSMO/UNIFAC-based model predictions, relative volatility or selectivity at the infinite dilution, process design, optimization and control of extractive distillation based on the minimization of total annualized cost (TAC) [8,9]. After achieving in separation targets, most of case had carried out the heat integration or thermally coupled schemes for compliance with cleaner production principles [10,11]. Plenty of investigations indicted that the ILs or organic solvent process combined with partial thermal coupling and heat pump technology exhibited better economic and environmental performance than simple extractive distillation [12–17]. Many ILs and organic solvents had been confirmed as the optimal entrainers in terms of alcohols-water separation. Such as triethylene glycol (TEG), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIM][Cl]) [18], glycerol [19], 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide [EMIM][DCA]) [20], 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanide [BMIM][SCN] [21], and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([EMIM][Br]) [22] for TBA dehydration, 2-hydroxyethylamonium formate, 2-hydroxyethylamonium butyrate [23], 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [EMIM][BF4] [24], and [EMIM][DCA] [25] for ethanol dehydration, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) [26] for IPA dehydration, [EMIM][SCN] [27], NMP [28] and glycerol [29] for n-propanol dehydration. In addition, the extractive distillation of ternary alcohols-water mixtures also has aroused the scientist interests. For instance, Li et al. [30] developed an extraction-azeotropic distillation process with ethylene glycol (EG) for recovery isobutanol and ethanol from wastewater. Shi et al. [31] proposed an extractive distillation processes with EG for recovery ethanol and TBA from ethyl tert-butyl ether production wastewater. In the synthesis of methanol and ethanol from syngas, the by-product water need be further separated, Dong et al. [32] selected [EMIM][Ac] as an appropriate entrainer for the extractive distillation of the methanol-ethanol–water mixture. In the process of producing of amino resin, there will be a large amount of industrial effluent rich in IPA and ethanol, which needs to be recovered to reduce environmental pollution. However, there are few works focused on extractive distillation of mixtures ethanol-IPA-water with two azeotropes. In this study, ILs extractive distillation integration with heat pump distillation process for recovery of ethanol and IPA from wastewater was proposed. The separation sequences and efficiency were analyzed in thermodynamic insights, and the mechanisms on enhancing VLE was explained via the sigma-profiles. Energy-economic comparison of four processes for separation of ethanol-IPA-water mixtures were performed."
1,Methodology,"In this work, the research framework for design of ethanol-IPA-water separation process can be seen in Fig. 1 . Thermodynamics analysis method was applied to select the optimal entrainer, and then to confirm the separation sequence. The ILs structure and their properties including density, molecular weight, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization and critical properties were found from C + A-EQ and CA-EQ files embedded in ILUAM01 databank. The ILUAM01 developed by Ferro et al. [33] is a very useful enterprise ILs database for evaluating thermodynamic property and process performance, and it was embedded in Aspen Plus V11. It contains 100 ILs composed by 30 cations and 23 anions. Organic solvents can be found form APV110 PURE37 databank. The six parameters for each component, that is, the COSMO molecular volume (CSACVL) and the five sets of sigma-profile values also were obtained from the ILUAM01 databank. The NRTL model and UNIFAC-Lei model were used to calculate the thermodynamic equilibrium of mixtures containing organic solvents and ILs entrainer, respectively. Experimental data was used to verify the reliability of calculation data. The dependable model parameters can be used for process simulation and optimization. Based on the results of materials flow and energy flow, the energy-economic analysis was performed to evaluate the industrial feasibility of proposed separation process."

3,VLE data,"3.1 VLE data As mentioned above, organic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), EG, lower viscosity ILs such as [EMIM][DCA], [EMIM][SCN] and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide ([EMIM][TCM]) have been shown to have the excellent efficiency for alcohols-water separation. The candidate entrainers for extractive distillation of ethanol, IPA and water can be screened out from these solvents. The two components VLE curve, that is y-x phase diagram, can directly reflect the number of theoretical stages required for separation of mixtures based on graphic method. The farther the VLE curves are from the diagonal, the less the number of theoretical stages is needed, and the easier the components are to separate. Herein, the y-x phase diagrams were used to validate the separation ability of these solvents. The binary interaction parameters of NRTL model were summarized in Table S1. The UNIFAC-Lei group definition, parameters (Q k and R k ) and newly revised group interaction parameters (a nm and a mn ) were obtained from the Lei’ group [34,35], and summarized in Table S2 and S3. The constituent groups of each component were given in Table 1 . The experimental data of [EMIM][DCA] + ethanol + water and [EMIM][DCA] + IPA + water was retrieved from the work of Orchillés et al. [25] and Orchillés et al. [36]. The calculation VLE data of ethanol–water, and IPA-water with different mole fraction of [EMIM][DCA] were summarized in Table S4 and S5, respectively. The calculation data of vapor mole fraction of ILs is zero due to the negligible vapor pressure. Water concentration in vapor or liquid phase was obtained by deducting all other components’ mole fraction from 1. The values of room-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) was used to check agreement between experimental VLE data and calculated VLE data, which was defined as Eq. (1): (1) RMSD % = 100 ∑ i = 1 2 ∑ j = 1 2 ∑ k = 1 n w ijk exp - w ijk cal 2 3 n 0.5 where n is the number of tie-lines, wexp and wcal are experimental mole fraction and calculated mole fraction of components, respectively. Herein, in each tie-lines, the calculation data included the vapor and liquid phase mole fraction of ethanol or IPA and liquid phase mole fraction of ILs. Subscripts i, j, and k denote components, phases, and tie-lines, respectively. For system of [EMIM][DCA] + ethanol + water, RMSD values for UNIFAC model is 0.763%, while RMSD values is 0.868% for system of [EMIM][DCA] + IPA + water, which means that using UNIFAC model shows a good representation of tie-lines data for studied system. The calculated data and experimental data were plotted in Fig. 2 . From that, it can be inferred that the used UNIFAC-Lei model is reliable for predicting the thermodynamic properties of [EMIM][DCA] + ethanol + IPA + water system in the following process simulation."
4,Entrainer selection and separation sequence,"3.2 Entrainer selection and separation sequence The effect of above entrainers on VLE curves of the ethanol-IPA, ethanol–water, and IPA-water at 100 kPa with entrainers fraction of 0.5 were shown in Fig. 3 . The VLE curves of Fig. 3(a) indicate ethanol is the light component via EG entrainer, and EG improves the separation ability of light ethanol to intermediate IPA, also Fig. 3(b) shows the enhancement of separation ability for intermediate component IPA and heavy component water. When using the [EMIM][DCA], [EMIM][SCN], [EMIM][TCM] or DMSO as entrainer, IPA will be the light component. Fig. 3(a) indicate three ILs can’t improve the separation ability of ethanol to IPA, while DMSO can significantly enhance VLE of ethanol to IPA. Fig. 3(c) suggested that the ILs [EMIM][DCA] can be the promising entrainer for separation of intermediate component ethanol and heavy component water. From thermodynamics analysis, the relative volatilities of light component to intermediate component and intermediate component to heavy component were greater with EG than with DMSO. Herein, this work used the EG as the basic organic entrainer, and the corresponding basic process was the single-column extractive distillation (SCED) process with EG, that is EG-SCED. Considering close-boiling points of ethanol and IPA but without formation of azeotropic mixture, the heat pump distillation (HPD) was applied for separation this mixture, and, the SCED with EG integration with HPD process, that is EG-SCED-HPD, was presented to reduce the energy consumption. Due to owning the negligible vapor pressure and the higher relative volatilities of intermediate component to heavy component, using ILs [EMIM][DCA] instead of the EG can also save the energy. The SCED with [EMIM][DCA] integration with HPD process, that is ILs-SCED-HPD, was performed. From Fig. 2(a), EG can significantly enhance the relative volatility of ethanol to IPA, therefore, the extractive distillation separation of ethanol and IPA can save energy. The double-column extractive distillation (DCED) of ethanol followed by IPA with EG, that is EG-DCED, was performed in comparison of ILs-SCED-HPD process."
5,Separation mechanism and sigma-profile analysis,"This section explained the mechanism of enhancing on VLE of intermediate component ethanol to heavy component water with the ILs [EMIM][DCA]. The ILs [EMIM][DCA], [BMIM][DCA], and [HMIM][DCA] were used to analyze the effect of alkyl chain length on separation ability. Essentially, the separation ability was determined by the microscopic intermolecular interactions. The surface screening charges generated from the COSMO calculation were used to obtain the averaged sigma-profile, which contains 50 segments, in the range of −0.025 e/Å2 to 0.025 e/Å2. The sigma (σ)-profile is the probability distribution of a molecular surface segment having a specific charge density, which can be divided into three regions, hydrogen bond (H-bond) donor region (σ < -0.0082e/Å2), nonpolar region (−0.0082e/Å2 < σ < 0.0082e/Å2) and H-bond acceptor region (σ greater than 0.0082e/Å2) [37]. The height and position of the peaks are different varied from different molecular structure. The farther the sigma-profile peaks are from the non-polar region, the stronger the ability of H-bond doner or acceptor will be. Therefore, sigma-profile distribution can be considered as the effect tools to reveal interaction mechanism at the molecular level. The sigma-profile of water, ILs, ethanol, IPA and EG were depicted in Fig. 4 . The sigma-profile distribution of ethanol is similar to water on H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor regions. Ethanol and water exhibit H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor abilities, but H-bond donor ability of water is stronger than that of ethanol. Due to the stronger H-bond acceptor ability appeared in the anion [DCA], thus, the separation mechanism is the formation of H-bond between H-bond acceptor of ILs and H-bond donor of water result in the improvement of VLE of ethanol to water. Also, due to the stronger H-bond acceptor ability of the [EMIM][DCA], it presented the higher separation ability than EG. The differences of sigma-profile distribution of [EMIM][DCA], [BMIM][DCA] and [HMIM][DCA] are only on the nonpolar region due to the same anion and cation. The non-polarity of ILs increased with increasing alkyl chain length. As shown in Fig. S1, the separation ability of [EMIM] > [BMIM] > [HMIM] indicates that the selectivity of cations is related to their chain length, which may be caused by the steric hindrance effect of long chain cations [38]."
6,Process modeling and analysis,"The process modeling, energy consumption, energy cost, capital cost and TAC of four processes including EG-SCED, EG-SCED-HPD, EG-DCED and ILs-SCED-HPD were analyzed in this section. The flowsheet of four processes mainly consists of an alcohols/water distillation column (AWDC), ethanol/IPA distillation column (EIDC), and solvent recovery column (SRC). During the process calculation, equilibrium stage models are employed for all blocks. The distillation column was modeled by the RadFrac block, while that of flash unit was Flash block, heat exchangers are model by Heatx blocks."
7,Process simulation and optimization,"5.1 Process simulation and optimization Process simulation and optimization method based on Aspen Plus V11.0 was used to obtain material flow and energy flow. The initial mass composition of wastewater is assumed to be 28.7% ethanol, 44.0% IPA and 27.3% water according to the industrial reports. The feed flow rate is assumed to be 1000 kg/h based on the most of cases. The feedstock of wastewater has been preheated at its bubble point at atmospheric pressure, whereas the pure entrainer has been fed at the corresponding temperature of its feed stage. The mass purities of ethanol and IPA products are both specified as 99.5%, while the total mass fraction of alcohols and solvent in the discharged water is required to achieve no more than 1000 ppm. After the high concentration of ethanol and IPA is recovered, the treated wastewater can be discharged into biological treatment system, and then it can be discharged into the water environment after total concentration below 5 ppm. The process boundary of wastewater treatment discussed here is only the high concentration alcohols recovery. 5.1.1 EG-SCED process The basic process is EG-SCED process as shown in Fig. 5 . The 1000 kg/h mixture are feed into the AWDC at the middle stage, while the entrainer enters into the top of the AWDC. The mixture of ethanol and IPA leaving from the top of AWDC is further fed into the EIDC to obtain the products of ethanol and IPA, and the mixture of entrainer and water leaving from the bottom of AWDC is further fed into the SRC for recovery of the solvent with mass purity of 99.99%, then the regeneration solvent leaving from the bottom of SRC recycled into the top of AWDC. The EG-SCED process variables including the total stages (NT1, NT2, NT3), feed stages (NF1, NFE1, NF2, NF3) and entrainer flow rate can be optimized based on the minimization of TAC. The separation requirements can be met through the adjustment of mass flow of distillate (D) and mole reflux ratio (RR). The sequential iterative optimization procedures for the EG-SCED process had been illustrated in the Fig. 6 . The effects of column pressure and total stages on TAC of EIDC was illustrated in Fig. 7 . It is clear that decreasing the pressure can significantly reduce the TAC for the total stages in the range of 75 to 90. However, the rising trend is unnoticeable after that. In addition, the lower TAC can be obtained from the conditions of very low pressure or quite a number of theoretical stages. Due to the effect of pressure changes on product purity, scenarios of quite a number of theoretical stages, that is 105, were considered, and the two-stage distillation column was used for separation of ethanol and IPA. Fig. 5 provides the flowsheet of the EG-SCED process with the optimal variables, stream results, and heat duty. The optimal total stages are: NT1 = 40, NT2-1 = 55, NT2-2 = 50, NT3 = 20; the optimal feed stages: NF1 = 27, NFE1 = 5, NF2 = 51, NF3 = 12, the optimal entrainer flow rate: S1 = 1770.09 kg/h. 0.14 kg/h entrainer needs to be supplement due to the solvent loss along with product streams. Due to the similar relative volatility of ethanol to IPA, the total stages, reboiler duty and condenser duty of EIDC are considerable. 5.1.2 EG-SCED-HPD process The reboiler duty of EIDC accounts for 68.2% of the EG-SCED process. Therefore, EG-SCED-HPD using HPD instead of traditional distillation to separate the ethanol and IPA to reduce the energy consumption. Energy saving is the conversion of steam consumption to electricity consumption. As shown in Fig. 8 , the overhead vapor of EIDC-1 was fed into the compressor to increase the vapor level, and then the countercurrent heat transfer between the compressed vapor and bottoms of EIDC-2 is carried out. Both condenser and reboiler duty can be reduced by using a temperature match between the top vapor and the bottoms liquid. The overall logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD) was set as 10 K, as depicted in Fig. S2, the discharge pressure of vapor needs reach to 169.5 kPa. The vapor was total condensed, 6947.59 kg/h liquid backflow into the top of EIDC-1, and rest was the ethanol product. The heated bottom of EIDC-2 was fed into the flash unit, the vapor fraction set as 0.9539. After flash, the vapor was fed into the bottom of EIDC-2, and the liquid was the IPA product. The electricity consumption of HPD process was 89.37 kW. The optimal variables, stream results, and heat duty were given in Fig. 8. 5.1.3 ILs-SCED-HPD process Compared with the EG-SCED-HPD process, the SRC used in the ILs-SCED-HPD process is flash unit due to the negligible vapor pressure of ILs. In addition, the relative volatility of intermediate component to heavy component was greater with ILs than with EG. Therefore, using ILs to replace EG can save energy and reduce investment cost. The variables of ILs-SCED-HPD process that need to be optimized include the total stages (NT1, NT2), feed stages (NF1, NFE1, NF2), pressure and temperature of SRC, and entrainer flow rate. Fig. 9 provides the flowsheet of the ILs-SCED-HPD process with the optimal variables, stream results, and heat duty. The optimal total stages are: NT1 = 35, NT2-1 = 55, NT2-2 = 50; the optimal feed stages: NF1 = 30, NFE1 = 3, NF2 = 51, the optimal entrainer flow rate: S = 952.82 kg/h. The temperature and pressure of SRC was the sensitive variables for the mass purities of water and ILs, and the relationship between mass purities and temperature or pressure were depicted in Fig. 10 . It suggested that the lower the operating pressure, the higher the purities of ILs that can be obtained at the lowest possible temperature, which is significant to keep ILs stable and recyclable [39]. Herein, the pressure is the same as the work of Chao et al, set to 1 kPa, and according to Fig. 10(b) the temperature was set to 442.15 K so that it can be heated by 1.0 MPa steam, the mass purity of regenerative ILs can be reach to 99.9%. ILs process do not require supplemental solvent. The electricity consumption of HPD process is 94.21 kW. 5.1.4 EG-DCED process The extractive distillation was applied for separating ethanol and IPA, then followed by extractive distillation of IPA and water, and SRC for separation of EG and water. The variables of EG-DCED process that need to be optimized include the total stages (NT1, NT2, NT3), feed stages (NF1, NFE1, NF2, NFE2, NF3) and entrainer flow rate (S1, S2). Fig. 11 provides the flowsheet of the EG-DCED process with the optimal variables, stream results, and heat duty. The optimal total stages are: NT1 = 56, NT2 = 40, NT3 = 20; the optimal feed stages: NF1 = 23, NFE1 = 4, NF2 = 35, NFE2 = 5, NF3 = 11, the optimal entrainer flow rate: S1 = 2770.37 kg/h, S2 = 956 kg/h. 0.296 kg/h entrainer needs to be supplement due to the solvent loss along with product streams. As shown in Fig. S3, compared with EG-DCED process, the DCED process with DMSO exists the higher total stages and RR, therefore, DMSO process was excluded."
8,Energy-economic comparison of four processes,"5.2 Energy-economic comparison of four processes The reboiler of distillation column can be heated by 0.5 MPa steam, 1.0 MPa steam, or 2.5 MPa steam according to the bottom temperature, the countercurrent heat transfer between steam and bottoms was carried out, and the minimum approach temperature was set as 10 K. The cooling water is applied for the condensers of towers, also the countercurrent heat transfer was used, and the minimum approach temperature is set as 5 K. The electricity is using for driving pump and compressor unit. The industrial price of 0.5 MPa steam, 1.0 MPa steam, 2.5 MPa steam, cooling water, electricity and inlet and outlet temperature of utilities are summarized in Table S6. According to the bottom temperature and minimum approach temperature, for the EG-SCED or EG-SCED-HPD process, reboilers of AWDC, EIDC and SRC were heated by 0.5 MPa steam, 0.5 MPa steam, and 2.5 MPa steam, respectively. For ILs-SCED-HPD process, the1.0 MPa steam was used to heat SRC instead of 2.5 MPa steam. For EG-DCED process, reboilers of EIDC, AWDC and SRC were heated by 0.5 MPa steam, 1.0 MPa steam, and 2.5 MPa steam, respectively. The detailed energy analysis results of four processes were given in Table S7-S10, and their energy cost are compared in Fig. 12 . For the basic process, the EIDC units accounts for the most energy cost, then the extractive distillation (ED) and HPD method can save the 78.1% and 67.3% energy cost, respectively. Compared with the EG-SCED-HPD process, energy costs of SRC and AWDC units of ILs process can further reduce 63.6% and 21.3%, respectively. It is clear that the energy cost of ILs-SCED-HPD process is the lowest, which is due to the ILs extractive distillation, Flash for solvent recovery, and HPD process. Compared with EG-SCED, EG-SCED-HPD and EG-DCED process, the energy cost of ILs-SCED-HPD can reduce by 57.7%, 28.6%, and 28.3%, respectively. As shown in Fig. S4, the utility analysis indicts that the dramatic decrease in steam costs results in a decrease in energy cost for ILs-SCED-HPD process. Based on the process simulation results, the economic analysis of different processes was further performed using the TAC model, which can be calculated by following equation: (2) TAC = Capital Cost/Paybackperiod + Operating Cost where capital cost contains the column cost, reboiler cost and condenser cost. The parameters for estimation the capital cost included the column diameter, column height, and heat exchanger areas were summarized in Table S11. The capital cost was calculated according to the work of Cui et al. [40]. The operating cost includes the energy cost and CO2 emission cost. The price of CO2 emission set as 38.19$/t according to the EU reports. The payback period was set as 5 years. As shown in Fig. 13 , due to the lower column cost, the EG-DCED process showed better performance than ILs-SCED-HPD in terms of TAC, then followed by EG-SCED-HPD and EG-SCED process. With the increase of CO2 emission cost, TAC of ILs and EG-DCED processes are gradually approaching. Therefore, both in energy and economic perspectives, ILs-SCED-HPD was confirmed as the promising process for separation of ethanol-IPA-water mixtures."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, ILs SCED integration with HPD process for recovery of ethanol and IPA from wastewater was proposed, and the energy-economic comparison of ILs [EMIM][DCA] and organic solvent entrainer EG process was performed. The high reliability of the used UNIFAC-Lei model for predicting the thermodynamic VLE of quaternary system of [EMIM][DCA] + IPA + ethanol + water is validated by experimental VLE data. For system of [EMIM][DCA] + ethanol + water, RMSD values is 0.763%, while that of system of [EMIM][DCA] + IPA + water is 0.868%. The ILs [EMIM][DCA] was selected as the optimal entrainer considering the viscosity and the selectivity of ethanol to water, and the separation mechanism with ILs is the formation of H-bond between H-bond acceptor of ILs and H-bond donor of water result in the improvement of VLE of ethanol to water. Four feasible separation processes involving EG-SCED, EG-SCED integration with HPD, [EMIM][DCA]-SCED integration with HPD, and DCED with EG were then compared by considering energy and economic aspects. Compared with EG-SCED, EG-SCED-HPD and EG-DCED process, the energy cost of ILs-SCED-HPD can reduce by 57.7%, 28.6%, and 28.3%, respectively. Economic analysis indicted that the TAC of ILs process was similar with EG process with increase of price of CO2 emission. This work provided a promising ILs process for recovery of ethanol and IPA from wastewater."
