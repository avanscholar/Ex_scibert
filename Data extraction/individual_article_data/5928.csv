0,Introduction,"The challenge of CO2 mitigation is a subject of great concern, which demands efficient methods able to lessen their accumulation. To do so, it is desirable to convert the CO2 in renewable energy sources and also to produce value-added chemicals [1,2]. There are diverse methods that can be applied for CO2 reduction that could be highlighted, such as thermochemical [3], biocatalysis [4], photocatalysis [5], electrocatalysis [6] and photoelectrocatalysis [7–10] reduction. The photocatalysis/photoeletrocatalysis reactions gained attention since the process is based in the photoactivation of the semiconductor assisted by a bias potential, for instance [10–12]. A great variety of products can be obtained from the CO2 reduction using photoelectrocatalysis, like carbon monoxide, methane, methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formate, acetate, acetone and so forth [13–15]. The product obtained from the reduction is attached to the variable of the system, mainly to the semiconductor material, supporting electrolyte, pressure, temperature, and other parameters. The literature [1,7,15–17] reports that copper and copper oxides have shown good efficiency as a p-type semiconductor for CO2 reduction, producing alcohol as the main product. On the other hand, even though TiO2 is usually the most used semiconductor, its application in this type of reaction is limited, since the conduction band position isn’t aligned in relation to CO2 reduction potential; also there is weak adsorption of CO2 on the surface of the catalyst and inefficient harvesting of solar radiation [18] Although TiO2 nanotubes are well known due to fine stability and catalytic activity [19,20], it does not present a good activity for CO2 reduction [12,21,22]. Ramesha, Brennecke and Kamat [23] affirm that TiO2 shows thermodynamic limitations as a reductant and the CO2 reduction occurs only due to the reduction of Ti4+ sites in TiO2, forming Ti3+ at an applied potential higher than -1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The main limitation would be the potential of the flat band that is lower than the potential required for CO2 reduction [22]. To overcome the problem of TiO2 application and avoid the photocorrosion of copper oxide photoelectrodes, several studies have indicated that TiO2 can be used as a good platform to anchor different modifiers, contributing to the success of CO2 photoelectrocatalytic conversion to alcohol [12,24,25]. Porphyrins are tetrapyrrolic macrocyclic compounds that can be found in nature and act as catalysts for different types of reactions, such as the epoxidation of olefins and the hydroxylation of inactivated hydrocarbons [26]. Copper porphyrins have shown good results as catalysts for catechol oxidation [27,28], sensors for hydrazine [29], and catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons [30]. Metalloporphyrins are also featuring good catalytic properties in many electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen reduction, hydrogen generation, carbon dioxide reduction, and others [31–34]. The literature indicates copper porphyrins for this kind of reaction using the porphyrin as the sole catalyst [35] or even combining it with another complex [36]. However, most of the reports use heterogeneous systems, for example creating metal-organic frameworks. Cathodized copper porphyrin metal-organic framework nanosheets were recently applied in the CO2 reduction using the electrocatalysis technique forming methane, carbon monoxide, formate, acetate, and H2 as products [30]. In addition, metalloporphyrins have also been used as model systems to understand the photosynthesis process and, therefore, they are applied in solar energy due to their excellent light absorption ability [37–39]. The good properties of Co and Fe porphyrins as photocatalysts in CO2 reduction are described in the literature [40–42]. However, the photoelectrocatalysis application of metalloporphyrins in CO2 reduction is scarce, except by the work of Kou et al. [43] that developed zinc porphyrin deposited at p-type NiO photoanode in the non-aqueous solution for the reduction of CO2 to CO. In order to search for a new photocatalyst in photoelectrocatalyis, the use of copper porphyrins complexes could be a good option. Thus, the decoration of Ti/TiO2 anode with meso-tetrasubstituted metalloporphyrins could be a good strategy to find an efficient photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. In this work the authors performed the immobilization of the copper(II)porphyrin [Cu(T4H3MPP)] abbreviated in this work as CuP (Fig. 1 ) [44] that is a porphyrin with a center of copper II and a hydroxy and a methoxy groups in the meso-substituents, on Ti/TiO2 nanotubes electrode surface in order to investigate its catalytic performance for CO2 reduction, modeling the system for selectivity to methanol and ethanol. The photoelectrocatalytic technique was compared with photocatalysis and electrocatalysis and the effect of metal center of the metalloporphyrin was also compared with the molecular catalyst in the same conditions in order to check the behavior of the material in each case."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis,"2.1 Synthesis The free base porphyrin (HP, [H2(T4H3MPP)] − [5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-hydroxy, 3-methoxyphenyl)porphyrin]) was synthesized by the Adler-Longo’s methodology [44,45]. Copper(II) ion was inserted into the purified HP using copper(II) acetate in dimethylformamide (DMF) [46,47] giving complex named CuP ([Cu(T4HM3PP)] − [5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-hydroxy,3-methoxyphenyl)porphyrinato copper(II)). HP and CuP that was characterized by UV–vis and FTIR spectroscopy."
3,Decoration of TiO2 nanotubes with Cu(II)porphyrins,"2.2 Decoration of TiO2 nanotubes with Cu(II)porphyrins Firstly, the titanium dioxide nanotubes (Ti/TiO2Nt) were prepared by anodization of clean and polished Ti plates [48]. Ti plates with 3.5 cm2 were anodized using a DC power supply (Minipa MPL-1303) in a two electrodes cell with DSA as counter electrode and 1.0 mol L−1 NaH2PO4 + 0.3 wt.% HF as supporting electrolyte. Electrochemical anodization was carried out under applied potential of 20 V for 2 h using a rate of potential ramp of 2 V min−1. After anodization, the TiO2 nanotubes electrodes were clean with DI water and annealed at 450 °C for 2 h in air with heating rate of 2 °C min−1. The decoration of TiO2 nanotubes was performed testing the Cu(II)porphyrin complex assigned as CuP, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The neutral complex CuP was immobilized by wet deposition. The TiO2 nanotubes were immerse in a solution with the CuP complex with DMF as solvent under magnetic stirring for 5 h at ambient temperature. After this time, the plate was dry in air atmospheric at room temperature. The amount of CuP impregnated in the TiO2 nanotubes was indirectly determined by UV–vis analysis (Hewlett Packard, model 8453) of the supernatant of the immobilization process, using as reference the Soret band of the CuP in the wavelength of 420 nm (ε= molar absorptivity 142802 L mol−1 cm−1)."
4,Semiconductors characterization,"2.3 Semiconductors characterization The structures and morphologies of TiO2 nanotubes modified with CuP were characterized by X-ray diffraction recorded on a Siemens Model D 5000 diffractometer and ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on a Zeiss model Supra 35 equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was performed in both the infrared and visible regions (UV–vis) in order to evaluate the spectra absorbance and the band gap of the material. The response of the semiconductor to UV–vis incidence was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) carried out at 0.01 V s−1 scan rate, in the absence and presence of UV–vis radiation in 0.1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 solution as supporting electrolyte with and without saturation with CO2. Cyclic voltammetry’s (CV) were carried out in a potentiostat/galvanostat PGSTAT 128 N Autolab system with Nova 2.1 software (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) using a conventional three-electrode cell (working, platinum counter electrode and Ag/AgCl 4 mol L-1 reference) starting in 0 V in a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. For this, onto glassy carbon was deposited 3 μL of a suspension of 0.1 mg mL−1 of HP or CuP in dichloromethane was performed in 0.1 mol L-1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in the range potential of +1.6 to -2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl 4 mol L-1. Whereas for Ti/TiO2NT and Ti/TiO2NT-CuP electrodes in the presence and absence of CO2 were performed in 0.1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 solution in the range potential of +1.0 to -1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl 4 mol L-1."
5,CO2 reduction,"2.4 CO2 reduction The CO2 reduction by photoelectrocatalysis (PEC), photocatalysis (PC), and electrocatalysis (EC) were performed in one steel cell reactor, which was demonstrated by Cardoso et al. [49], with three electrodes. An Ag/AgCl 4 mol L−1 used as reference, DSA as counter electrode, and the Ti/TiO2NT-CuP applied as working electrode. All the studies were performed in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte saturated with CO2 for 1 h at controlled pH 4.5 and without control at pH 7. The light incidence was performed by the quartz window using a Xe lamp of 300 W."
6,Products analysis,"2.5 Products analysis The products were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) (Shimadzu 2010 instrument) using a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique. The sample was concentrated in the SPME fiber before the analysis, for that, 0.5 mL of the sample was heated in a sealed container of 1.5 mL at 65 °C for 7 min and the fiber was exposed to the headspace during 5 min. The CG-FID analysis was performed in a Stabilwax column with N2 as carrier gas (1.0 mL min−1), injector, and detector at 250 and 260 °C respectively. The heating ramp started at 40 °C heating 2 °C min-1 until 46 °C following to heating 45 °C min−1 until 170 °C that was maintained during 3 min [50]. The same method was used to construct the calibration curves for methanol and ethanol that presented determination coefficients of 0.99 and 0.95, respectively. The curves showed a linear range from 0.002 to 5.00 mmol L−1, and a detection limit of 0.002 mmol L−1, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of the Ti/TiO2NT-CuP film,"3.1 Characterization of the Ti/TiO2NT-CuP film The copper porphyrin (CuP) was immobilized on the Ti/TiO2NT surface by wet deposition forming the as-named Ti/TiO2NT-CuP semiconductor. The amount of CuP immobilized was followed by UV–vis spectroscopy. From data obtained for CuP in it is possible to assign the characteristics bands of the porphyrin: the intense Soret band at 420 nm and the smaller but still intense Q bands around 500–700 nm in the UV–vis spectra [51,52]. Correspondingly, the UV–vis spectra obtained for Ti/TiO2NT-CuP prepared when Ti/TiO2NT was immersed during 5 h in DMF solution containing CuP indicated a decreasing in the Soret and Q bands. Using the molar absorptivity of the Soret band (ε = 142802 L mol−1 cm−1) of the complex, it was possible to determine the quantity of CuP deposited on Ti/TiO2NT as 8.8 × 10-8 mol, corresponding to 7.6 % of the CuP present in the initial solution. Fig. 1 illustrates the FEG-SEM images recorded for Ti/TiO2NT before (Fig. 2 a) and after immobilization of CuP (Fig. 2b and c) on its surface. The anodization of Ti plates produced nanotubes with a medium of 900 nm of length, 110 nm of diameter, and 13 nm of wall thickness [48]. After CuP deposition the top view of Ti/TiO2NT presents a surface decorated with particles agglomeration, leaving free areas of Ti/TiO2NT able to be photoexcited by light incidence, as expected. The high crystallinity as the crystallographic phases of the catalyst were identified by XRD diffractogram. The mainly peaks were indexed by Crystmet - The Metals Database (Fig. 2d), where T correspond to titanium substrate with peaks at 2θ = 40.1; 62.9 and 76.2 (ID 862753), A correspond to TiO2 in anatase phase with peaks at 2θ = 25.3; 35.1; 38.3; 47.9; 52.9; 54.2; 54.9; 70.5 and 82.1 (ID 497154). The XRD confirmed the formation of anatase phase of TiO2, which is the more photoactive phase of TiO2, presents a high charge carrier mobility when compared with the rutile phase of TiO2 and exhibits lower electron-hole pair recombination [53,54]. On the other hand, it was not possible to observe the CuP presence, probably due to the small amount of copper in the semiconductor surface. In order to evaluate the behavior of the semiconductor under UV–vis light incidence, the materials were submitted to absorbance, diffuse reflectance, and photocurrent analysis. The absorbance of Ti/TiO2 nanotubes with and without CuP surface modification is presented in Fig. 3 a. A similar pattern is observed for both cases, but higher absorption is observed for Ti/TiO2NT coated by CuP followed by a slight redshift (or bathochromic shift) from 360 nm to 370 nm. It is well known that porphyrins can exhibit excellent absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the visible light region [55]. Thus, under light illumination, electrons present in the HOMO can be photoexcited to LUMO of the porphyrin, increasing the electrons present in the surface of Ti/TiO2NT-CuP and the absorption at the visible region. This bathochromic shift could be associated with the narrower band-gap of the material [56], as confirmed by the Tauc plot’s analysis. Fig. 2b shows the Tauc plot’s [57] used to estimate the bandgap energy of the Ti/TiO2NT and the Ti/TiO2NT-CuP. The diffuse reflectance measurements were converted into an equivalent absorption coefficient using the Kubelka-Munk equation [58,59]. The band gap calculated for Ti/TiO2NT (3.3 eV) was close to the described in the literature (3.2 eV) for anatase phase [60–62], while the band gap of the Ti/TiO2NT-CuP is slightly changed to 3.2 eV. Additionally, in Fig. 3a is possible to observe, besides the high absorption values after 380 nm, broad absorptions peaks in the visible light region, more pronounced for Ti/TiO2NT but still present in the Ti/TiO2NT-CuP semiconductor. According to Ampelli et el. [63], this absorption in the visible light is not observed for commercial TiO2 (such as P25) or TiO2 films prepared by the sol-gel method, just for ordered TiO2 nanotubes prepared by anodization methods, due to light diffraction and scattering. This behavior endorses the superior performance of anodized Ti/TiO2NT as semiconductor for photoelectrocatalysis. In order to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of copper porphyrin, cyclic voltammograms of HP and CuP were recorded at glassy carbon electrode coated by deposition of 3 μL of porphyrin (0.1 mg mL−1 HP dispersed in dichloromethane) in 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) solution, as shown Fig. 4 . The free base porphyrin (HP) showed not reversible peaks between +1.6 to −2.0 V (Fig. 4, red line). A small oxidation peak is observed with E1/2 potentials at +1.25 V and two defined reductions peaks with E1/2 potentials at −1.00 and −1.75 V, that could be attributed to the stepwise macrocycle-centered processes explained in other vanillin porphyrins by the formation of cation/anion radicals and respective dianions in the second reduction [64]. From the cyclic voltammograms, it was estimated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the corresponding band gap energy. From the oxidation onset potential (E HOMO = − (E ox onset + E 1/2 ref) and (E LUMO = − (E red onset + E 1/2 ref), where E1/2 ox is the energy required to take out the first electron from the HOMO (eV) and the contrary is LUMO [55,65], the ΔE1/2 potential between the first oxidation and first reduction is 2.25 V for HP. In addition, is observed two pair of reduction peaks at −0.13 V and −0.27 V attributed to the Cu(II)/Cu(I) and Cu(I)/Cu(0) that is reversibly regenerated on the reverse scan at −0.40 V and −0.27 V, respectively. The ΔE1/2 potential between the first oxidation and first reduction is 2.65 V for CuP suggesting that the electron densities are attenuated in the CuP and change the energy of the LUMO and HOMO in relation to the free base centered only in the π-conjugated macrocycle system. Taking into account that the electrode material interferes in the electrochemistry behavior of porphyrins [66], further studies were carried out comparing the performance of the CuP thin films deposited at nanotubes Ti/TiO2NT surfaces electrodes. Fig. 5 presents the voltammetric behavior of Ti/TiO2Nt-CuP under the effect of CO2. Fig. 5a and b illustrates the cyclic voltammograms obtained for Ti/TiO2NT and Ti/TiO2NT-CuP immerse in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 without and with CO2 saturation under dark, respectively. Fig. 5c shows the photocurrent response of Ti/TiO2NT-CuP by linear voltammetry in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 without and with CO2 saturation under UV–vis light incidence and under dark. In the CV without CO2 (wine line), is possible to observe the peak I related to the reduction of Ti+4 to Ti+3 around -0.75 V (Fig. 5a wine line) and the H2 evolution that occurs only at -1.5 V in the cathodic region, in the anodic region is possible to observe a small peak related to the oxidation of Ti (III) to Ti (IV) at -1.4 V [67]. After CO2 is dissolved in the electrolyte during 10 s (Fig. 5a pink line) occur a decrease in the current of the peak I and the formation of the peak II in the anodic region around −0.90 V, indicating the adsorption and desorption of CO2 onto Ti/TiO2NT, respectively. The adsorption/desorption of CO2 in the electrode surface is confirmed by the increase/decrease in the current after the higher dissolution of CO2 is dissolved in the electrolyte (Fig. 5a blue line). In the case of the CV for Ti/TiO2NT-CuP without CO2 presence, shown in Fig. 5b (black line), the peak (III) around −0.65 V can be attributed the Cu2+ to Cu+ reduction, that disappears under CO2 presence [68], as observed in the red line (Fig. 5b), indicating strong adsorption of CO2 in the metallic center of the complex at this potential, which could inhibit the metal reduction in the complex or promotes an indirect reduction of CO2 to −CO2 , the intermediate for other products formation. Additionally, in the reverse scan, there is a formation of an extra peak around −0.8 V, probably related to the desorption of CO2 as −CO2 . Thus, the results clearly indicated that the CuP deposition contributes to increasing the trapping of CO2 on the electrode surface, and it is essential for the first step of the CO2 reduction [10,69,70]. The linear voltammograms obtained under dark and UV/Vis irradiation for Ti/TiO2Nt-CuP in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 in the presence and absence of dissolved CO2 is shown in Fig. 5c. In the absence of light (black curve) there is no generation of electron/hole pairs, presenting just a slight decrease in the current density values related to the electrocatalytic reduction of water in the cathodic region. After the incidence of UV–vis light with energy higher than the material band gap in the semiconductor, it was observed the generation of electron/hole pairs evidenced by the increase current density around -0.2 V and by the shift of the photocurrent around -0.75 mA cm-2 to a less negative potential. The photocurrent shift for less negative potential is mainly pronounced in the presence of CO2 (blue curve). The increase of the photocurrent for more negative values under CO2 influences around -0.8 V denotes that the electrons generated in the semiconductor surface after the light incidence are preferably trapped by the CO2 than by the water. In other words, the CO2 reduction is preferential on Ti/TiO2Nt-CuP semiconductor than H2 generation. The photocurrent vs potential curves indicate that the Ti/TiO2NT-CuP semiconductor is suitable for the reduction of CO2 under photoelectrocatalysis technique and the possible best potential for this propose is possible around -0.8 V. The cyclic voltammograms obtained for Ti/TiO2NT-CuP semiconductor in presence and absence of dissolved CO2 in the supporting electrolyte corroborates to prove the interaction of CO2 with the electrode surface, as observed in the Fig. 5."
9,Reduction of dissolved CO2 by photoelectrocatalysis,"3.2 Reduction of dissolved CO2 by photoelectrocatalysis In order to monitor the product generated from the photoelectrocatalysis conducted during 2 h at Ti/TiO2Nt-CuP electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 saturated with CO2 and submitted to UV–vis irradiation and bias potential of −0.2 V and −0.80 V, aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed by gas chromatography, and the products methanol and ethanol were able to be identified and quantified in both potentials (Fig. 6 ). The formation of methanol was preponderant in all experiments. The results indicated that around 0.35 mmol L−1 of methanol and 0.033 mmol L−1 of ethanol were generated after 2 h of photoelectrocatalysis conducted at −0.80 V. However, the methanol generation decreases markedly at potential of −0.20 V and there is no detectable amount of ethanol in this case. Methanol and ethanol are formed in agreement with Eqs. 1 and 2, that presents the thermodynamic reactions for CO2 reduction to these products and their respective thermodynamic potentials versus SHE at pH 7 [71]: (1) C O 2 + 6 H + + 6 e - → C H 3 O H + H 2 O E r e d o x 0 = - 0.380 V (2) C O 2 + 12 H + + 12 e - → C 2 H 5 O H + H 2 O E r e d o x 0 = - 0.329 V As it can be observed in Table 1 , different products can be obtained from the CO2 reduction using copper(II)porphyrin-based catalysts, mainly due to the different metallic centers used in each case and also because of the different experimental conditions. Even though there are no reports in the literature about methanol and ethanol formation from CO2 reduction using metalloporphyrin-based catalysts by PEC, just a few studies employing PC technique were able to obtain methanol, while there is no evidence of ethanol formation using metalloporphyrins-based as catalysts for EC, PC or PEC reduction of CO2. According to the best of our knowledge, ethanol formation was quantified for the first time in the present work. Additionally, comparing those results obtained in the present work with other study reported in the literature with PEC reduction of CO2 using TiO2-Cux-based electrodes as catalysts under similar experimental conditions is easily observed the improvement in the methanol concentration, that in this case reach a value almost four times higher than the obtained previously in the literature [8,12] and mainly related to the ethanol formation, that was also not identified or did not achieved similar values in other studies [8,12,72]. Taking in consideration the improve in the performance of PEC technique in comparation to photocatalysis (PC) and electrocatalysis (EC) techniques reported in other works, a comparation of those techniques was analyzed in order to understand the effect of potential in the performance of the CO2 reduction. Fig. 7 compares the quantity of methanol and ethanol formed after 2 h of reaction under Ti/TiO2NT-CuP semiconductor with experiments in the same experimental conditions, but without bias potential for PC and without light irradiation for EC. Using PC and EC techniques it was obtained a higher formation of ethanol comparing with methanol generation, differently of the reaction under PEC, that presented a higher formation of methanol and a small quantity of ethanol. The methanol formation under PEC technique was at least six times higher than the concentration obtained under PC technique, which was also around six times higher than the production under EC technique. The results reflect the synergic effect obtained when irradiation of UV–vis light is coupled to a negative bias potential at Ti/TiO2NT-CuP semiconductor. However, the ethanol formation under PC was twice higher than the ethanol obtained under PEC technique. Similar behavior was obtained by Singh et al. [78], that observed a higher ethanol formation using the energy of a photovoltaic panel connected to an electrochemical cell than using a PEC or a Tandem PEC system. According to the authors, the difference in the products distribution can be attributed to the differences in the current densities and overpotential that are applied in the working electrode. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that methanol formation has a higher selectivity under PEC. Understanding the mechanistic details for CO2 reduction with different types of catalysts still a challenge. However, some possibilities have been proposed in the literature. Behrens and coworkers [79] presented experimental evidence regarding the active site of copper species for methanol formation. According to the authors, methanol formation by an industrial method and by CO2 reduction under Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts occurs by Cu nanoparticles sites via the methoxy intermediate, CH3O-Cu. Hori [80] also discussed the interaction of CO2 with Cu atoms and the catalytic effects in the electroreduction of the CO2 process. Zall, Linehan and Appel [81] reported that CO2 reduction to formate under a copper (I) complex is based on the adsorption of one oxygen of the CO2 under the Cu sites followed by electron and proton reactions. Cardoso and coworkers [25] presented TiO2 nanotubes modified with MOFs of ZIF-8 and according to the authors, the effect of the ZIF-8 in the reaction is related to its capacity of the preconcentrate the CO2 presented in the system. There is a high chance that the Ti/TiO2Nt-CuP semiconductor has similar behavior, as indicated by Fig. 5. Based on that, a proposed mechanism for the charge transfer in the Ti/TiO2NT-CuP semiconductor is presented in Fig. 8 . The charge mechanism of Ti/TiO2NT-CuP semiconductor (Fig. 8) starts from the activation of Ti/TiO2NT by light incidence with energy higher than the band gap of the catalyst [12]. That energy absorption transfers the electrons (e−) to the conduction band (CB) generating a hole in the valence band (VB). This e − will be trapped by the metallic center of the porphyrin, reducing the Cu (II) to Cu (I). The CO2 will be reduced on this metallic center, generating the methanol and ethanol products and restoring the Cu (II), similarly to proposed by Zhao et al. [74]."
10,Conclusion,"Our findings indicate that Ti/TiO2Nt-CuP semiconductor can be easily prepared by coating TiO2 nanotubes with copper (II) porphyrins (in this case, [Cu(T4H3MPP)]). Copper(II)porphyrins act as an efficient co-catalyst in the photoelectrocatalytic systems and are able to convert the dissolved CO2 in an aqueous medium to 0. 35 mmol L−1 of methanol and 0.033 mmol L−1 of ethanol after 2 h of PEC carried out in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 and -0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl and UV–vis irradiation. The photoelectrocatalytic technique was superior in methanol and ethanol formation when compared with photocatalysis and electrocatalysis in the same conditions, forming at least six times more methanol. This is the first time that methanol and ethanol formation is reported from CO2 reduction using a porphyrin-based catalyst by PEC, while there is no evidence of ethanol formation using metal porphyrins-based as catalysts even applying EC, PC or PEC. Ethanol was quantified for the first time in the present work. The ethanol concentration was also the higher one observed comparing with other works of CO2 reduction using PEC and TiO2/Cux-based electrodes. All the experiments presented in this work were performed using only one semiconductor, showing the good stability obtained from the coupling of Ti/TiO2NT with copper (II) porphyrin."
