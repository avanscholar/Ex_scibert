0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds is one of the most vital and fundamental transformations in synthetic chemistry and chemical industries [1–4]. Generally, stoichiometric amounts of inorganic and organic oxidants such as hypochlorite, Cr salts, Mn salts, oxalyl chloride, and hypervalent iodine are utilized to oxidize alcohols to the corresponding carbonyls. However, most of these oxidants are toxic in nature, produce a large amount of hazardous waste, commonly show poor functional-group tolerance, and often over-oxidize the products [5–16]. Therefore, concentrated efforts have been made on the development of environmentally benign aerobic oxidation pathways in the presence of transition metal-based catalysts. In recent years, there has been significant growth in catalytic acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation (AAD) as it is an oxidant-free, atom-economical method for the oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds [17–26]. This protocol is also very important as it provides a unique route for hydrogen production from sustainable biomass-derived alcohols and carbohydrates for chemical energy storage applications [17–26]. Several transition metal based homogeneous catalysts including complexes of iridium [27,28], osmium [29], rhodium [30], ruthenium [31–34], nickel [35], iron [36,37], cobalt [38–40], and copper [41] were used for the dehydrogenative oxidation of alcohols. Most of these homogeneous catalytic systems require stoichiometric amounts of base or additive, extensive synthesis of ligand or catalyst, often suffer from air sensitivity, and are difficult to recover and recycle. To overcome these limitations, several heterogeneous catalysts have been developed such as, ruthenium nanoparticles in aluminum oxyhydroxide (Ru/AlO(OH)) [42], hydrotalcite-supported copper nanoparticles (Cu/HT) [43], hydrotalcite-supported silver nanoparticles (Ag/HT) [44], γ-alumina-supported silver cluster catalyst (Ag/Al2O3) [45], hydrotalcite-supported gold nanoparticles (Au/HT) [46], Co/TiO2 [47], nickel-nanoparticle-loaded θ-Al2O3 (Ni/θ-Al2O3) [48], Cu(0)/Al2O3 [49], rhenium nanocrystalline particles (Re NPs) [50], Al2O3-supported rhenium with different oxidation states and Re0 metal nanoparticles [51], Cu/La2O2CO3 catalyst [52] and iron-based catalyst (Fe-L1@EGO-900) [53]. Few palladium based heterogeneous catalysts have also been reported as active catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenation [54–57]. Nevertheless, these reactions require either high temperature or prolonged reaction time and reactions were mostly performed in presence of equivalent or excess amount of base in organic solvent. In the last two decades, concentrated efforts have been made for the synthesis of silica-based ordered mesoporous matrix because of their extensive applications in gas storage, sensing, catalysis, solid catalyst support and so on [58,59]. Amongst silica family, SBA-15 is one of the well studied mesoporous silica having large surface area, highly ordered 2D hexagonal architecture, good thermal and mechanical stability [60,61]. Recently, numerous research groups mainly focused on the preparation of different metal and metal oxide nanoparticles supported inside the pore channel or into the wall of SBA-15 for efficient application in catalysis [62–64]. The large surface areas of these hybrid materials along with a strong attachment of the homogeneously distributed catalytically active metal centers make them efficient candidates for heterogeneous catalysis. These materials also exhibit good recyclability, eradicate the leaching problem of the grafted metals and suitable from an environmental perspective. Therefore the synthetic utility of such porous materials suitable for heterogeneous catalysis increases continuously. Several attempts in terms of immobilization of metal oxide on different solid supports, especially the preparation of ordered mesoporous silicas containing active Pd-sites have been reported in recent times [65–74] However, the wall modified porous materials in catalysis is necessary as over growing concentration of active metal centers inside pore channel reduces pore volume and inhibits the approach of reactants towards metal centers. Here, we describe the synthesis of highly dispersed and aggregate-free palladium oxide nanoparticles (PdO NPs) intercalated into the walls of mesoporous silica (PdOMS) for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols under solvent free conditions. Recently, ACS GCI Pharmaceutical Roundtable revealed that solvents are the prime contributor towards unsatisfactory E-factor and major source of organic waste in a reaction [75]. Indeed, the total mass of chemicals used in pharmaceutical industries consists of solvents [76]. Accordingly, much effort has been undertaken by pharmaceutical industries to reduce the use of solvents, develop solvent-free reaction and to promote reactions in aqueous media or environment friendly solvents. Thus, solvent free organic transformation is emerging as an important field both in industry as well as in academia [77–79]. Therefore, development of solvent free organic methodology using reusable heterogeneous catalyst is of great interest to the chemists. Moreover, the particle sintering in heterogeneous palladium based-catalysts in presence of chemicals or under reaction environment is of particular importance [80]. In the present work, incorporation of PdO NPs within the framework of SBA–15 makes the catalyst thermally and chemically highly robust and more resistant to deactivation by particle sintering than the catalysts where palladium particles are stabilized inside the pore channels or on the support surface. This PdOMS catalyst requires mild reaction conditions for the acceptor-less oxidation, has the advantage of eliminating the use of high boiling solvents as the reaction proceeds under solvent free condition and the possibility of over oxidized products formation. This acceptorless dehydrogenation methodology also has been extended to the catalytic synthesis of benzimidazoles and benzoxazole from alcohols."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (Pluronic P123), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99%), Sodium tetrachloropalladate(II) (99.99%), bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl] tetrasulfide (≥90%) and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without further purification. All solvents were analytical grade and distilled prior to use. Tetrahydrofuran, toluene, xylene, and 1,4-dioxane were dried by refluxing over sodium/benzophenone, followed by distillation under an argon atmosphere, and stored over 4 Å molecular sieves. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on a Merck 60 F254 silica gel plate (0.25 mm thickness) and column chromatography was performed on Merck 60 silica gel (60–120 mesh). The PdOMS catalyst was synthesized slightly modifying the method reported previously for synthesis of gold nanoparticles intercalated mesoporous silica by Richards and co-workers [81–83]. PdMS and Pd/SBA-15 catalysts were characterized with TEM, ICP-OES, TPR, XPS and N2 physisorption and reported previosly [83]."
3,Characterization techniques,"2.2 Characterization techniques Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed using a JEOL JSM 7610F instrument. The sample were dispersed on a conductive carbon tape and analyzed using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and particle mapping were performed in the aforementioned SEM instrument equipped with an Oxford Instruments X-MaxN 50 X-ray detector using the same sample preparation methods used for SEM imaging. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging was done on a Philips FEI CM 200 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. For the TEM analysis, the samples were dispersed in ethanol and then dropped onto copper grids with porous carbon films. Powder X-ray diffraction data was recorded at room temperature using a Bruker D8 Advance SWAX diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with a step size 0.008 and a scanning rate of 0.1 min−1 in the 2θ range of 20–85°. A NOVA 2200e Surface Area and Pore Size Analyzer was used to investigate the textural properties of the catalyst. The surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the pore size distributions were calculated by the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) method. Prior to the sorption experiment, the samples were degassed under a nitrogen flow at 373 K for 6 h to remove impurities adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. After degassing, the catalyst was subjected to nitrogen physisorption analysis at 77 K to evaluate specific surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution, and pore diameter. The content of palladium in PdOMS was determined using a PerkinElmer inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) model NexION 300Q. For ICP-OES analysis, approximately 20 mg of catalyst was left overnight in 2 mL 1(M) NaOH solution to leach out silica framework. The resulting mixture was then acidified by 1(M) aqua regia to achieve a homogeneous solution. The solution was then heated to dryness and residue was re-dissolved in 5 mL water. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 and 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature with CDCl3 or DMSO-d6. Chemical shifts (δ) of 1H NMR spectra are reported in ppm relative to residual solvent signals (CHCl3 in CDCl3: δ = 7.26 ppm, DMSO in DMSO-d6: δ = 2.50 ppm); data are reported as br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet; J values are given in Hz."
4,Synthesis of PdOMS,"2.3 Synthesis of PdOMS 10 g Pluronic P123 was dissolved in 375 mL of 2 M HCl in a round-bottomed flask at 318 K. Subsequently a mixture of 20.8 g tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 100 mmol) and 2.7 g bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl] tetrasulfide (5 mmol) was slowly added under stirring. Then an aqueous solution of sodium tetrachloropalladate (II) (1.2 g, 4 mmol) was added drop-wise. The solution was stirred for 24 h at 45 °C temperature and aged for 72 h at 100 °C without stirring. The precipitated solid was filtered off and washed with water thrice followed by ethanol (2 × 30 mL). The resulting solid was dried at 100 °C for 24 h and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h."
5,Synthesis of bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl] tetrasulfide modified SBA-15,"2.4 Synthesis of bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl] tetrasulfide modified SBA-15 10 g Pluronic P123 dissolved in 375 mL of a 2 M HCl in a round bottom flask. Then a mixture of 20.8 g tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 100 mmol) and 2.2 g of bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl] tetrasulfide was added to the solution. The combined mixture was stirred for 24 h at 45 °C and aged for 72 h at 373 K without stirring. The precipitated solid was filtered off and washed with water thrice followed by ethanol. Then resulting precipitate was dried at 100 °C for 24 h and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h."
6,General procedure for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols,"2.5 General procedure for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols A mixture of PdOMS (10 mg) and Cs2CO3 (10 mol %) was added to a dried 10 mL Schlenk tube under an argon atmosphere. The Schlenk tube was capped with a rubber septum, evacuated, and filled with argon. Alcohol (5.0 mmol) was added to the Schlenk tube with a syringe. After the addition, the Schlenk tube was degassed properly with sonication and vacuum. Then it was placed in an oil bath heated at 80 °C and stirred gently for a fixed time under a steady flow of argon. After completion of the reaction, 5 mL ethyl acetate was added to the reaction mixture and catalyst was separated by simple centrifugation. The filtrate was then concentrated and product isolated through column chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate (97:3) as eluent."
7,General procedure for synthesis of 2-substituted benzoxazole or benzimidazole,"2.6 General procedure for synthesis of 2-substituted benzoxazole or benzimidazole A mixture of PdOMS catalyst (15 mg) and alcohol (1.2 mmol), o-aminophenol or o-phenylenediamine (1.0 mmol) and t BuONa (20 mol%) were added to 3 mL toluene in a 10 mL Schlenk tube under argon atmosphere. The Schlenk tube was capped with a rubber septum, evacuated, and filled with argon. Then the tube was placed in an oil bath heated at 110 °C and stirred gently for a fixed time under steady flow of argon. After completion of reaction the catalyst was separated by centrifugation. The reaction mixture was then concentrated and product was isolated through column chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate (70:30 for benzimidazole and 90:10 for benzoxazole) as eluent."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization Scheme 1 shows the formation of mesoporous silica with well-dispersed palladium oxide nanoparticles intercalated into the walls of silica (PdOMS) using a thioether group as a functional group to facilitate introduction of Na2PdCl4 into the framework of mesoporous materials [81–83]. The simultaneous use of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) with 1,4-bis(triethoxysily)propane tetrasulfide (TESPTS) ensured the co-condensation of the thioether group in the framework. The thioether ligand thus facilitated efficient intercalation of Na2PdCl4 into the walls of the forming mesoporous silica. This single step co-condensation method provides uniform distribution of organic functionalities as well as palladium. After introduction of Na2PdCl4, calcination was done at 550 °C to remove the organic moieties and to obtain mesoporous silica-supported highly-dispersed palladium oxide nanoparticles. Fig. 1 a exhibits the typical nitrogen adsorption isotherms which are type IV in nature. The adsorption isotherm shows a sharp increase at pressures of 0.40–0.8, which is a characteristic of condensation within uniform mesopores. Usually, the BET surface area and pore volume of mesoporous silica with metal nanoparticles within the pores are smaller than those of the pure mesoporous silica. The BET surface area and pore volume of the as prepared PdOMS sample were found to be 683 m2g–1 and 0.78 cm3g–1, respectively. Pure SBA-15 prepared under same condition using TEOS and TESPTS has a BET surface area of 541 m2g–1 and a pore volume of 0.72 cm3g-1. Micropores originated from the introduction and subsequent removal of TESPTS and intercalation of PdO particles inside the wall attribute to the higher surface area and pore volume of PdOMS compared to the SBA−15. Corresponding pore size distribution plots of these samples estimated by using the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) [84] model is shown in the Fig. 1b. The average pore diameters are calculated to be 6.1 and 6.8 nm for SBA-15 and PdOMS, respectively. Fig. 2 a shows the XRD patterns of PdOMS catalyst. The presence of characteristic peaks of PdO in wide-angle X-ray diffraction of the PdOMS confirm the formation of crystalline PdO phase. The diffraction pattern matches quite well with the standard diffraction data of the PdO with tetragonal unit cell with a = 3.020 and c = 5.316 Å (JCPDS No. 85–0713). As shown in Fig. 2, the peaks at 2θ = 34.44, 42.58, 55.5, 61.8 and 72.9 can be indexed to the (101), (110), (112), (200) and (202) planes of PdO, respectively. The PdOMS catalyst has very broad and weak peaks for PdO, indicating that the PdO particles are very small or highly dispersed, and the small crystalline grain sizes came from the confined growth of PdO in the walls of mesoporous silica. The low-angle XRD patterns of the SBA−15 and PdOMS are shown in Fig. 2b. The three characteristic peaks at the 2θ values of 0.9, 1.45 and 1.80 could be attributed to the 100, 110 and 200 reflections, respectively. The decreased intensity and the shifted peak positions in PdOMS indicate the successful intercalation of the PdO nanoparticle in to wall of the mesoporous silica. The palladium loading in the PdOMS measured by ICP-OES analysis was determined to be 3.85%. The SEM images (Fig. 3 a and b) of the PdOMS exhibit whorl-like structure with a diameter of ∼200 nm and a length of 1–2 μm. The TEM image of the PdOMS clearly suggests that uniformly ordered mesopores of dimensions ca. 6–7 nm have been arranged in a honeycomb-like hexagonal array throughout the specimen (Fig. 3c). Highly uniform spherical PdO NPs were present on the surface of mesoporous silica as depicted in Fig. 1(d-f). The crystalline nature of the PdOMS can also be conﬁrmed from the clear lattice fringes observed in HRTEM image (Fig. 1 g). The interfringe spacing for the lattice fringes of PdOMS NPs are calculated to be 0.262 nm that corresponds to the (101) lattice planes of the tetragonal PdO NPs. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the PdO NPs (Fig. 1h) exhibits two diffraction rings that correspond to (101) and (110) crystal planes of the PdO NPs. PdO NPs intercalated on to the wall of the SBA-15 have narrow size distribution with an average size of 3.5 nm (Fig. 1g). The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy of PdOMS shows the presence of Pd and Si (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information). The EDX analysis indicates that 4.1% palladium is present in the PdOMS, which is in good agreement with the ICP-AES result. The palladium dispersion was measured by EDS mapping of the catalyst (Fig. 4 ). The results demonstrate that the palladium is homogeneously dispersed throughout the surface of the silica support, and is not segregated. The surface composition and electronic structure of the PdOMS was further confirmed by XPS analysis. Fig. 5 shows the high-resolution Pd 3d spectra. The two peaks observed at 337.2 and 342.5 eV can be assigned to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, respectively and are consistent with the reported values for Pd(II) which confirms the presence of PdO species."
10,Catalytic properties,"3.2 Catalytic properties We examined catalytic activity of PdOMS for the oxidant-free acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols. Benzyl alcohol (1a) was selected as a model substrate to optimize the reaction condition. Firstly, a suite of solvents with varying polarities including dichloroethane (DCE), dioxane, dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile (ACN), water, tetrahydrofuran (THF), xylene, and toluene were tested (Table 1 , entries 1–8). Benzyl alcohol was treated in presence of PdOMS and catalytic amount of Cs2CO3 (10 mol%) as base at 80 °C in different solvents for 8 h under a slow and steady N2 flow. Toluene (Table 1, entry 7) and xylene (Table 1, entry 8) were found to furnish high conversion of alcohol with over 90% yield for benzaldehyde. All other solvents tested gave relatively inferior conversion of benzyl alcohol and poor yield for benzaldehyde. Interestingly, acceptorless dehydrogenation under solvent-free condition provided excellent yield (95%) of benzaldehyde compare to the previous conditions (Table 1, entry 9). We then investigated the effect of reaction temperature and time in neat alcohol. Decreasing the reaction temperature or reaction time, significantly reduced the yield (Table 1, entries 10 and 11). Further study revealed that the nature of the base plays an important role in the reaction yield. A series of inorganic bases such as Na2CO3, K2CO3, Cs2CO3, K3PO4, NaOH, KOH, NaO t Bu were investigated (Table 1, entries 9, 12–17). Amongst all the bases, Cs2CO3 was found most effective. We further screened Pd(OAc)2, Na2PdCl4, palladium on charcoal (Pd/C), and SBA-15 as catalyst (Table 1, entries 18–21), however very poor conversions were observed. The catalytic activity of, named as PdMS, The catalytic activity of PdOMS was also compared with two reference catalysts (PdMS), H2 reduced PdOMS [83], and (Pd/SBA-15), where Pd particles are supported on the surface of SBA-15 [83,85]. The PdMS catalyst, where PdO particles present in PdOMS were reduced under H2 gas flow, exhibited very good conversion with 92% yield (Table 1, entry 22). The other catalyst, Pd/SBA-15 was found to exhibit inferior yield (60%, Table 1, entry 23). Reaction performed in absence of the catalyst exhibited only trace yield (Table 1, entry 24). After the optimization, the catalytic activity of PdOMS was investigated in the dehydrogenation of various alcohols. The dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol was first examined followed by various substituted benzyl alcohols (Table 2 , entries 2a–2i). The effect of electron withdrawing and donating groups was studied thoroughly. It was found that the yield of the dehydrogenated products were moderate to very good both for electron-donating and electron-withdrawing benzyl alcohols though alcohols bearing electron donating group furnished relatively better yield than alcohols having electron-withdrawing substitution as substrates having electon-withdrawing group show inertness towards β-hydrogen elimination. Heterocyclic primary alcohols, pyridin-3-ylmethanol (1j), and thiophen-2-ylmethanol (1k), anthracen-9-ylmethanol (1l), and allylic aliphatic alcohols (1m), 2,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-ol (1n), and but-2-en-1-ol (1o), also furnished good yield (Table 2, entries 2j–2o). We next investigated the catalytic activity of PdOMS in the dehydrogenation of various secondary alcohols as summarized in Table 3 . Benzylic and heterocyclic secondary alcohols were smoothly dehydrogenated to give the corresponding ketones in high yields (Table 3, entries 4a–4h). 1-(Anthracen-9-yl)ethanol (3i), diphenylmethanol (3j), 9,10-dihydroanthracen-9-ol (3k) and several sterically crowded di-substituted diphenylmethanol (3l–3n) also underwent dehydrogenation to produce corresponding ketones with very good yields (Table 3, entries 4i–4n). 1,2-Diphenylethanol upon oxidation converted to 1,2-diphenylethanone with 85% yield (4o). Oxidation of 2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone (3p) and cyclohexanol (3q) gave benzil (4p) and cyclohexanone (4q) with 82% and 74% yield, respectively. After establishment of dehydrogenative oxidation of alcohols we extended our work towards PdOMS catalysed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of alcohol with o-aminophenol and o-phenylene diamine to build 2-substituted benzoxazole and benzimidazole, respectively (Scheme 2 ). Among benzofused nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, the benzimidazole and benzoxazole scaffold are important structural units in natural products, synthetic pharmaceutical and agrochemical compounds [86–90]. Direct reaction of o-aminophenol and o-phenylene diamine with an alcohol to selectively form 2-substituted benzoxazole or benzimidazole, respectively, with the liberation of hydrogen gas and avoidance of the use of external oxidants will be an environmentally benign protocol. PdOMS was also found to catalyze oxidant-free and acceptorless dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles generated in intermediate steps during the formation of benzimidazole or benzoxazole efficiently. In recent years, a few groups used this concept to synthesize azole based heterocycles utilizing N2,N6‐bis(di‐isopropylphosphino)pyridine‐2,6‐diamine [91], Ru2Cl4(CO)6 with Fe3O4@SiO2@PPh2 [92], Pt-loaded Al2O3 [93], iridium(0) nanoparticles on TiO2 [94], Pd(dppf)Cl2 [95], and Co- PNNH pincer complex [96]. Few palladium based catalysts such as Pd-doped hydrotalcites (Pd-HTs) [97] and Pd/SiO2 [98] have also been reported for acceptorless dehydrogenation of amines and heterocycles. Under the pre-optimized conditions for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols, reaction of neat benzyl alcohol with o-phenylene diamine (5a) as model substrates afforded 2-phenyl benzimidazole in 50% yield and in case of o-aminophenol (7a), 40% yield of 2-phenyl benzoxazole was obtained. Further attempts to increase the reaction yield reveals that the reaction was most effective in toluene in presence of t BuONa (Table S1 in Supporting Information) as the base (20 mol%) at 100 °C. With increase of catalyst loading (15 mg) and increasing the reaction time (14 h), the yield increased significantly to 90% and 82% for 2-phenylbenzimidazole, and 2-phenylbenzoxazole, respectively, under open inert condition. Reaction yield decrease considerably in close system under inert atmosphere. The catalytic activity of Pd/SBA-15 [75] catalyst was also tested for the synthesis of 2-phenyl benzimidazole and 2-phenyl benzoxazole under similar conditions, but no cyclised product was obtain. With this optimized condition in hand, substrate scope for 2-substituted benzimidazole and benzoxazole synthesis was investigated. Alcohol containing electron-donating group (entries 6 ab–6ae, Table 4 and entries 8 ab, 8ac, 8ah, Table 5 ) cyclize faster than alcohol containing electron-withdrawing group (entries 6af, 6 ag, Table 4 and entries 8ad–8ag, Table 5). Benzyl alcohol having ortho substitution and heterocyclic alcohols afforded moderate yield of 70–75%. The reactions also provide very good yield with substitution of –Me, –OMe at the o-phenylene diamine unit (entries 6ba–6ea, Table 4). Acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyl simultaneously produces one equivalent of hydrogen gas (Scheme 3 ). A volumetric quantitative analysis of 1-phenylethanol dehydrogenation using a gas burette revealed the formation of hydrogen gas close to one equivalent (∼72% of theoretical yield; Fig. S2, experimental details and calculation given in Supplementary material). To confirm hydrogen evolution in the reaction, intermolecular hydrogen transfer experiments were carried out. The dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol (1a) was performed in the presence of 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (2c) in a closed system purged with argon (Scheme 2). Benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde as the main product while 4-methoxybenzaldehyde was hydrogenated to (4-methoxyphenyl)methanol in 36% yield which was confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. S3). Rate of hydrogenation of 4-methoxybenzaldehyde slowed down in an open system under inert atmosphere. Further, reduction of styrene and 4-nitrophenol were performed in the presence of evolved hydrogen using Pd/C catalyst. In a typical experiment, the dehydrogenation reaction of 1-phenylethanol (3a) in presence of PdOMS was performed in a Schlenk tube connected through a rubber tube with another Schlenk tube containing styrene and catalytic amount of Pd/C in THF (Scheme 3). The NMR spectra of reaction mixture containing styrene indicate that around 64% of styrene is hydrogenated to ethyl benzene (Fig. S4), which supports the fact that the H2 gas liberated from the first Schlenk tube during the dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol reduced styrene present in the second Schlenk tube. A similar experiment was carried out using 4-nitrophenolate in methanol (Scheme 3). The reaction mixture was monitored by UV–Vis spectroscopy before and after reaction. Before reaction, methanol solution showed a peak at 400 nm due to yellow colour of 4-nitrophenol. After reaction, a new peak was observed at 295 nm due formation of 4-aminophenol (Fig. S5), which clearly indicates the reduction of nitro group to the amine in presence of Pd/C catalyst and liberated H2 from dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol. These experimental results conclusively support the acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols catalysed by PdOMS. Acceptor-free dehydrogenative coupling of primary alcohol with 5 or 7 also involves concomitant formation of two-equivalent of hydrogen gas. A volumetric quantitative analysis of reaction of benzyl alcohol with 5a using a gas burette again revealed near-quantitative formation of two equivalent hydrogen gas. (∼69% of theoretical yield, for experimental details and calculations see Supplementary material). A reaction mechanism for the dehydrogenation of alcohols by PdOMS is presented in Scheme 4 in the case of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation as an example. The first step of the reaction is proton abstraction from the alcohol by a base to yield an alkoxide group. An alkoxide bonded to the palladium undergoes β-hydride elimination to generate palladium-hydride intermediate and benzaldehyde in the rate-determining step. The benzaldehyde is then eliminated in presence of another molecule of alcohol which binds to the palladium. The catalytic cycle is completed via a dehydrogenation step which involves an intramolecular proton transfer from alcohol to the metal-bound hydride. The reusability of PdOMS was investigated for the dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol (3a) and is shown in Fig. 6 a. The catalyst was recovered by simple centrifugation, washed thoroughly, and reused five times in the dehydrogenation of 3a without significant loss of activity and selectivity. The fidelity of PdNPs based heterogeneous catalysts is still in debate as it has been suggested that PdNPs often serve as reservoirs of Pd and palladium ions released during catalytic reactions catalyze reactions homogeneously. To rule out the contribution of homogeneous catalysis, the dehydrogenation of 3a was conducted in the presence of PdOMS for 4 h to obtain a yield of 55%. The solid catalyst was then removed by filtration and the filtrate was transferred to another vessel. Stirring of the catalyst-free solution was continued for additional 6 h under the optimized conditions, but no further reaction took place. The reaction solution was also analyzed by ICP-AES after each run and no metal ion were detected within the detection limit. Further, low angle XRD and XPS were done for the recovered catalyst after five runs to investigate stability and chemical composition of PdOMS catalyst, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6b, the most intense peak (100) was observed in reused catalyst, however higher order diffractions such as (110) and (200) were not clearly observed. Moreover, reused catalyst exhibited peaks at 335.5 and 340.9 eV, being ascribed to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 components for the Pd(0) species. The value obtained at lower binding energy indicates the reduction of PdO species to Pd(0) during acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols. Hydrogen gas produced during the reaction might be attributed to the in situ reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0). In order to examine the efficiency of PdOMS, we compare the results for the acceptor-less dehydrogenation in presence of our catalyst with few heterogeneous palladium-based catalysts [54–57] reported so far in the literature (Table S2). As evident from Table S2, most of the previously reported methods have limitations such as the use of hazardous organic solvents [55–57], or high reaction temperature (≤110 °C) [55–57], or longer reaction time [54–56] or excess amount of base [54]. In contrast, acceptor-less dehydrogenation in the presence of PdOMS can be carried out under solvent free condition at relatively lower temperature, shorter reaction time with excellent functional group tolerance of substrate. Moreover, dehydrogenative oxidation of alcohols can be performed in presence of lower mol% of Pd."
11,Conclusion,"Well-dispersed palladium oxide nanoparticles intercalated into the walls of mesoporous silica (PdOMS) were prepared by functionalizing silica with thioether groups. Characterization of the material demonstrated that it maintains a mesoporous structure with uniform pores and possesses high surface area and pore volume. Mesoporous silica-supported palladium oxide was found to act as a heterogeneous and reusable catalyst for the acceptorless dehydrogenation of primary as well as secondary alcohols. The reaction in solvent free condition, at relatively lower temperature, use of catalytic amount of base and excellent functional group tolerance of this current protocol may serve as an attractive alternative to those of the existing methods. The same catalyst was further exploited for cascade synthesis of 2-substituted benzoxazole or benzimidazole from primary alcohols and o-aminophenol and o-phenylene diamine, respectively. The catalyst could be removed from the reaction pot by simple centrifugation and reused 5 times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Further application for the PdOMS catalysed dehydrogenation of different heterocycles and cascade reaction through acceptorless dehydrogenation are under investigation in our laboratory."
