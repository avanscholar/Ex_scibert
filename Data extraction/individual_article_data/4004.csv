0,Introduction,"Biomass, as a renewable material for energy which has a negligible content of sulfur and nitrogen, is supposed to be very clean [1]. The fast pyrolysis of biomass has aroused great attention in recent decades [2]. However, bio-oil has some disadvantages such as high viscosity, thermal instability, corrosiveness and chemical complexity, which set up many obstacles before its full utilization as a kind of renewable energy [3,4]. Among the upgraded methods [5–11], the hydrotreatment of bio-oil as one of potential methods has been widely studied and it is shown that the caloric value and storage stability increased dramatically. But the process conditions are rather severe (350–450°C, 5–15MPa), leading to the formation of substantial amounts of gases and undesirable char. Thus there is a strong incentive to develop new ways to operate the process at lower temperature and hydrogen pressure. In situ hydrogenation is a novel method for hydrogenating complex chemical compounds [12,13]. Liquid hydrogenation donors were used during the hydrogenation process instead of hydrogen gas. Tan [14] and Fisk [15] used acids as hydrogenation donors for hydrogenating bio oil model compounds and raw bio-oil. But the study on the effects of the coupling and the application for in situ hydrogenation are still lacking. Ford [16] investigated the approach to disassembling biomass-derived lignin in supercritical methanol over Cu-doped porous metal oxide catalyst. The hydrogen generated from methanol transferred to the organosolv lignin. Methanol could produce hydrogen over some kinds of catalysts. The reactions take place via the formation of CO as an intermediate product, which is subsequently converted to CO2 by water–gas-shift reaction (WGS). The overall reaction is aqueous phase reforming (APR). While the APR is always accompanied by methanation or Fischer–Tropsch reactions, which can generate methane and other alkanes which could reduce the selectivity of H2 [17]. (1) Reforming : CH 3 OH ↔ CO + 2 H 2 (2) WGS : CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 (3) APR : CH 3 OH + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + 3 H 2 (4) Side Reaction : CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Nickel catalysts could not only catalyze the APR of methanol but also be general ones for the hydrogenation [18]. Ni as a kind of base metal has a good potential to use in many industry fields compared with noble metal catalysts such as Pt [19]. The purpose of this paper is to develop new hydrogenation donors on the in situ hydrogenation of the bio-oil and investigate the reaction process during the upgrading by the in situ hydrogenation of model compounds. We upgraded model compounds and raw bio-oil using in situ hydrogenation and proposed a new way in mild conditions over Ni catalyst. The instability of bio-oil was for the instability compounds such as ketones, aldehyde, and phenols. Acetone and phenol as the typical compounds were suitable as the model compounds to investigated the probability for the upgrading of the bio-oil. Methanol was used for the hydrogen donor by APR in stead of commercial hydrogen gas. The effect of conditions on the performance of methanol’s APR and the coupling on the in situ hydrogenation of acetone and phenol in liquid phase over Raney Ni catalyst were studied. The contents of typical compositions in raw and upgraded bio-oil and the possible reactions happened during the in situ hydrogenation process were discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Acetone (⩾99.5%, analytical reagent) and phenol (⩾99.5%, analytical reagent) were purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagents Factory and Guangzhou Chemical Reagents Factory. Methanol (⩾99.5%, analytical reagent) was purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co. Ltd."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts With constant magnetic stirring, 160g deionized water and 40g NaOH were added into a 500mL three-necked round-bottom flask for 20wt% NaOH aqueous solution. Then 30g Ni–Al alloy (Dalian Toyounger Chemical Co., Ltd.) was slowly added to the bottom at 50(±2)°C. The solution was precipitated after 1.5h of magnetic stirring at the temperature of 50°C. The solid phase was washed by distilled water until the pH reaching 8–9 and then by ethanol for 6 times. The prepared Raney Ni catalyst was stored in ethanol."
4,Typical procedure for APR of methanol and in situ hydrogenation,"2.3 Typical procedure for APR of methanol and in situ hydrogenation The APR of methanol, the in situ hydrogenation of compounds and raw bio-oil were performed in a 100mL stainless autoclave (Fig. 1 ) in the present of 0.5g Raney Ni catalyst. In a typical experiment of the APR of methanol, water (30g) and methanol (6.7g) (8:1 in molar ratio) were loaded into the reactor. In a typical experiment of the in situ hydrogenation of acetone and phenol were chosen as the model compounds. The raw materials (water:methanol:model compounds, 8:1:0.2 in molar ratio) were loaded into the reactor. Then the reactor was sealed and purged with N2 for 3 times to exclude air. An automatic controller was used to control the temperature and the revolution of stirrer (400rpm). The pressure was raised to 0.1–3MPa and the reaction temperature was set from 160 to 220°C with the heating rate of 10°C/min and the reaction time was 4h after reaching the set temperature. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature and then sampled gas and liquid products for gas analysis. Considering the water content in the light composition of bio-oil, the raw materials were water 19g, methanol 6.7g and light composition of bio-oil (bio-oil) 14g. After sealed and displaced the air by N2, the pressure was raised to 3MPa and the reaction temperature was set at 220°C. After 4h reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to the room temperature. The liquid products were sampled for gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) analysis."
5,Products analysis,"2.4 Products analysis The gas products of the APR and the in situ hydrogenation of model compounds were sampled for analysis by GC using Shimadzu GC20B gas chromatograph. The liquid products of the APR and the in situ hydrogenation of model compounds were sampled for analysis by Shimadzu GC 2010 gas chromatograph. The amounts of products were determined based on GC data using the external standard method. All results were evaluated on the basis of the amount of reactors (including acetone and phenol). The conversion of reactors (mol%) and the selectivity (mol%) of main products were calculated as below. The molecules of H2 in the in situ hydrogenation included two parts. One was the moles analysis in GC and the second part was the consumption in the in situ hydrogenation process. Conversion = 1 - Moles of reactors Moles of reactors loaded initially × 100 % Selectivity of product = Moles of product Moles of reactor converted × 100 % H 2 Selectivity = Molecules of H 2 produced C atoms in gaseous phase × 3 × 100 % = Molecules of H 2 produced + Molecules of the consumption in insitu hydrogenation C atoms in gaseous phase × 3 × 100 % Alkane selectivity = C atoms in gaseous alkanes total C atoms in gaseous product × 100 % The raw bio-oil and the product were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Trace 2000, Thermo-Finnigan Inc., USA). The separation was realized on a column of DB-5MS, 30m×0.25mm×0.1μm, and the oven temperature program was 40°C (holding for 8min) at 6°C/min to 280°C (holding for 30min). The contents of different compounds were evaluated by the area percentage of GC–MS."
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.5 Catalyst characterization The surface area and pore size distribution of Raney Ni were carried out over chemical adsorption instrument by Quantachrome at −200°C. The catalyst was degassed at 250°C for 10h prior to its measurement, whose surface area was calculated by the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method. The average pore diameter and pore volume were calculated with the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. X-ray powder diffraction(XRD) pattern were obtained on a RigakuD/max-rCX-ray diffract meter with the settings of 40kV and 40mA using Cu Kα radiation, and data were collected at steps of 0.02° in the 2θ range of 5–80°. The chemical composition of Raney Ni was identified by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, OPTIMA 8000)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of Raney Ni catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of Raney Ni catalyst The chemical compositions and physical properties of Ni–Al alloy and Raney Ni were shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2 . Shown in Table 1, there were different on the compositions and the A BET of Raney Ni and Ni–Al alloy. After dissolved by NaOH solution, the content of Al decreased and the A BET increased dramatically. The typical XRD pattern of Raney Ni can be seen in Fig. 2."
9,The APR of methanol over Raney Ni catalyst,"3.2 The APR of methanol over Raney Ni catalyst The APR of methanol for H2 was mainly influenced by the reaction temperature and initial pressure in the autoclave. The results were shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2 . The GC results of the gas production showed that there was no CO detected. It meant that the reaction (2) was completed. From Table 2, the conversion of methanol and the selectivity of main gas products changed by temperatures and initial pressures, which had a positive effect on the APR conversion of methanol and the selectivity of CH and had a negative effect on the selectivity of H2, which has the same trend with the Ref. [20]."
10,Effect of initial pressure on the in situ hydrogenation of bio-oil’s model compounds,"3.3 Effect of initial pressure on the in situ hydrogenation of bio-oil’s model compounds In the absence of catalyst, acetone and phenol had no change after 4h in situ hydrogenation reaction. After adding catalyst, the gas products distributions under different initial pressures were shown in Fig. 4 . The conversions of model compounds and the results of the APR of methanol were shown in Tables 3 and 4 . From the results in Fig. 4, Tables 3 and 4, it could be seen that the in situ hydrogenation of model compounds could happen over Raney Ni catalysts. Over the catalyst, the hydrogenation of acetone and phenol could couple with the APR of methanol. Using N2 to provide initial pressure was to remain the reactants in the liquid state during the whole reaction process. The existence of pressure had a certain relationship not only on the APR of methanol for the hydrogen generation, but also on the hydrogenation of acetone and phenol. At 220°C, when the pressure rose from 0.1MPa to 1MPa, the conversion of acetone fell slightly and when the pressure went on rising, this rate increased significantly. This trend was quite similar with the in situ hydrogenation process of phenol. The selective of isopropyl alcohol, as the main product of in situ hydrogenation reaction of acetone, decreased but changed little with the rising of the initial pressure. In terms of phenol, cyclohexanol was the main product during the in situ hydrogenation process, whose selectivity decreased with the increase of initial pressure. The change on the conversion and selectivity of acetone and phenol might be associated with the activity of catalyst. According to reports in the literature [21], the reaction pressure could affect the activity of Raney nickel. With the increasing of pressure, the activity of Raney Ni decreased. Comparing with Table 2, in the model compounds reaction system, the conversion of the methanol APR and the selectivity of H2 increased, while the selectivity of CH decreased meanwhile. At 220°C, 3MPa, the conversion of methanol was 49.23% in the pure APR of methanol. And it was 60.36% in the in situ hydrogenation. The selectivity of H2 and CH changed from 38.22% and 40.69% to 58.20% and 32.83%, respectively. This might because the in situ hydrogenation reaction was the consecutive reaction with the APR of methanol. The consumption of hydrogen in the hydrogenation could promote the hydrogen production and improve the selectivity of hydrogen. As the competition reaction with the side reaction, the in situ hydrogenation suppressed the selectivity of CH to some extent."
11,Effect of reaction temperature on the in situ hydrogenation of bio-oil’s model compounds,"3.4 Effect of reaction temperature on the in situ hydrogenation of bio-oil’s model compounds The gas products distributions of in situ hydrogenating acetone and phenol at different temperatures were shown in Fig. 5 . The conversions of acetone and phenol and the results of the APR of methanol were shown in Tables 5 and 6 . From Fig. 5, Tables 5 and 6, it could be seen that the reaction temperature had a significant effect on the in situ hydrogenation reaction. With the temperature increasing, the conversion of acetone and phenol increased. When the temperature was 220°C, the conversions of acetone and phenol reached the highest point. For acetone, the selectivity of isopropanol changed less, but also showed a trend of decrease with the increase of reaction temperature. The yield of the product was more inclined to propane. Temperature has a big promote on reforming and hydrogenation [21]. Therefore, the increasing of temperature had an advantage not only on the hydrogenation but also on the reforming of methanol. For the in situ hydrogenation of phenol, the selectivity of cyclohexanol reached the highest point at 200°C. The increasing of temperature was in favor of the conversion of hydrogenation reaction. But at higher temperature, the selectivity decreased. That might because the selectivity of hydrogen decreased in the APR of methanol, when the temperature increased. Compared with the pure APR of methanol, the methanol conversion and selectivity of H2 were improved and the selectivity of CH decreased in the in situ hydrogenation process. But the trend had no change during the hydrogenation process."
12,In situ hydrogenation of the bio-oil,"3.5 In situ hydrogenation of the bio-oil The in situ hydrogenation of bio-oil was carried out at 220°C and 3MPa. The GC–MS results of the raw and upgraded bio-oils were shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 showed that the compositions of bio-oils were relatively complex, which contained many organic compounds. The compositions and the contents of the bio-oil before and after in situ hydrogenation reaction changed significantly. From the images of the bio-oils, the raw bio-oil before reaction was brown opaque liquid, while after upgrading the bio-oil became colorless and clear. The main composition of bio oil before and after the in situ hydrogenation was shown in Table 7 . Table 7 showed that in the raw bio-oil, propanone (R.T.=6.80min) could be hydrogenated totally. The conversion was higher than the highest result in the model reaction. It meant that the compounds in bio-oil could accelerate and promote the hydrogenation of acetone. On the contrary, in the upgraded bio-oil, the cyclohexanone (R.T.=6.46min) and cyclohexanol (R.T.=7.92min) were found, but the conversion of phenol was not optimistic, which was much lower than the result in the model reaction. Acetic acid (R.T.=8.65min), which was the most abundant compound in the raw bio-oil, was significantly decreased after the in situ hydrogenation process. The corresponding products were found as acetic acid, methyl ester in the upgraded bio-oil. During the upgrading process, the reforming of some low carbon compounds might happen which might include formic acid, 1,2-ethanediol, and acetaldehyde, hydroxyl. These compounds were so active to react with water or by themselves to product gas, so they and their productions could not be found in the upgraded bio-oil. Many newly formed compounds were found in the upgraded bio-oil. The newly formed compounds in the upgrading process and their possible formation pathways were shown in Table 8 . From Table 8, it could be seen that the in situ hydrogenation of model compounds happened during the upgrading process. Propanone could be hydrogenated to isopropyl alcohol. Phenol could be hydrogenated to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. Except for these, acetic acid could be esterized with methanol for acetic acid, methyl ester. Propanoic acid, methyl ester was also obtained through esterification. From Table 8, many CO group and CC groups could be hydrogenated to CO and CC group during the in situ hydrogenation process. Such as tetrahydrofurfurylalcohol (R.T.=2.99min), cyclopentanone (R.T.=4.99min) and pentanol (R.T.=12.10min) might come from furfural (R.T.=8.84min), 2-cyclopenten-1-one (R.T.=7.39min) and pentanal (R.T.=15.93min) in this way. The contents of the typical compositions in the raw and upgraded bio-oils were shown in Table 9 . From Table 9, the contents of typical compositions in the raw and upgraded bio-oil changed significantly. The content of ketone/aldehyde, organic acids decreased after in situ hydrogenation. The content of phenol did not change significantly. That was because of the hydrogenation and esterification happened during the upgrading process. The content of alcohols and esters, as the products of the in situ hydrogenation, increased dramatically. Different from the results reported [15] for Pt catalyst, the main products were aromatic compounds at 350°C. And the dosage of Pt catalyst was much higher."
13,Conclusions,"The conversion of bio-mass and its pyrolysis products is becoming a big project and bring potential energy resource. Over Raney Ni catalyst, the APR of methanol could couple with the hydrogenation of acetone, phenol and the raw bio-oil. The hydrogen product from the APR of methanol could offer hydrogen source for the upgrading of the bio-oil model compounds and the raw bio-oil. The main products of acetone and phenol were isopropanol, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. Temperature and initial pressure had an obvious influence on the APR of methanol, the conversion of model compounds and the selectivity of products. At 220°C and 3MPa, the conversion of acetone and phenol reached the highest point with 55.76% and 64.65%. The in situ hydrogenation of bio-oil was carried out at 220°C and 3MPa. After upgrading, the bio-oil was improved not only on the appearance but also on the compositions significantly. Ketones/aldehydes and phenols can be converted effectively to alcohols. In the in situ hydrogenation reaction system, acids could happen esterification to esters. After in situ hydrogenation, the contents of ketone/aldehyde and organic acids decreased from 30.36% and 39.89% to 9.32% and 30.25% respectively. The contents of alcohols and esters increased from 8.89% and 4.9% to 16.33% and 20.53%. During the in situ hydrogenation process, hydrogenation and esterification were the main reactions in the bio-oil."
