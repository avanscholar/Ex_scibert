0,Introduction,"In mixed anaerobic cultures, inhibiting the growth of hydrogen (H2) consumers such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) is achieved by pretreating the inoculum using chemical and physical methods. Heat shock and chemical inhibitors (BES (2-bromoethanesulfonate), chloroform as well as long chain fatty acids (LCFAs)) have been used to control the growth of methanogens in mixed cultures [1–5]. Using LCFAs offers many advantages over other methods because they are environmentally friendly, naturally occurring, non-toxic and biodegradable. Polyunsaturated LCFAs with an 18-carbon chain such as linoleic acid (LA (C18:2)) are reported to enhance the H2 yield from glucose degradation by anaerobic mixed cultures [3–5]. C18 LCFA degradation by-products are also able to exert varying degrees of inhibition on mixed anaerobic communities [6]. When LCFAs (LA or lauric acid (LUA (C12)) are added alone or in combination with other LCFAs, they are inhibitory to mixed anaerobic communities [3,7,8]. Capric acid (CA (C10)) and myristic acid (MA (C14)) have shown to exert a low degree of inhibition; however, increased inhibition is detected when they are added together with LUA [7,8]. LCFA degradation proceeds via the β-oxidation (Eq. (1)) reaction [9]. During β-oxidation, acetate and H2 are produced as intermediates and subsequently converted to methane [9]. According to Eq. (1) stearic acid (SA, (C18:0)) is degraded sequentially to 1 mol of acetate, 2 mol of H2 and 1 mol of an LCFA with a carbon chain reduced by two carbons (Palmitic acid (PA, (C16)) [10]. The free energy of the overall degradation of C18 to acetate and H2 (Eq. (2)) under standard conditions is +469.4 kJ mol−1 [10]. (1) CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 16 COO − + 2 H 2 O → CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 14 COO + CH 3 COO − + H + + 2 H 2 Δ G ° ′ = + 50.8 kJ mol − 1 (2) CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 16 COO − + 16 H 2 O → 9 CH 3 COO − + 8 H + + 16 H 2 Δ G ° ′ = + 469.4 kJ mol − 1 Many studies have demonstrated that the degree of LCFAs inhibition is correlated with concentration as well as the chemical structure [8,11,12]. Flocculated cultures with large void volumes are more susceptible to inhibition when compared to granular cultures [12] because a larger fraction of outer cell wall surfaces are exposed to adsorption by LCFAs. For a given volume, the volatile suspended solids (VSS) in flocculated cultures are less when compared to granulated cultures. Hence, loading rates for reactors containing flocculated cultures are lower than those for granulated cultures. High-rate H2 production during dark fermentation requires high substrate loading rates which in turn is associated with high biomass concentrations. Several reports have compared the H2 yields for flocculated and granular mixed anaerobic cultures from different sources; however, these studies lack details related to the microorganism type and population [13,14]. Flocculated cultures inhibited by chemical stressing agents or heat treated have been shown to yield more H2 when compared to uninhibited cultures [13,14]. Evidence comparing microbial population changes with H2 production using uninhibited and inhibited granular and flocculated cultures from the same origin has not been reported. Hence, one objective of this study is to compare H2 production at 37 °C using LA inhibited granular and flocculated cultures from the same origin at an initial pH set at 5.0. Another objective is to determine the H2 yield after exposing granular and flocculated cultures to LA for varying incubation periods."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inocula source,"2.1 Inocula source The granulated anaerobic culture utilized in this study was obtained from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor located at an ethanol manufacturing facility (Chatham, ON). The flocculated culture was prepared by crushing the granular culture and then sieving (sieve # 200) and washing the culture into a 4 L serum bottle. Using flocculated cultures with similar microorganism type and population composition as that of the granular cultures was essential to minimize variability between the two inocula."
3,Experimental design,"2.2 Experimental design Experiments were designed to examine the effects of the microbial architecture, microbial inhibitor, microbial inhibitor degradation by-products and incubation period on the H2 yield in the flocculated and granular cultures (Table 1 ). The electron donor and microbial inhibitor were glucose and LA, respectively. The composition and type of microbial populations in anaerobic mixed cultures will vary with time and hence, all experiments were performed simultaneously using both inocula to minimize this problem. All experiments were conducted in 160 mL serum bottle batch reactors (37 ± 2 °C) containing cultures set at an initial pH of 5.0 plus a VSS level of 2000 mg L−1 [3]. At specific intervals over 0–30 days, control experiments (Table 1) were conducted with only LA (TCI, OR (99% purity)) or with only glucose (ACP Chemicals, QC). Control experiments with LA were conducted to assess H2 production from LA and its degradation by-products over the duration of the study. Control experiments were also conducted using glucose. The glucose controls (No LA) and LA fed cultures were injected with glucose at the beginning of each incubation period. The LA and LA plus glucose reactors were prepared in triplicate and designated as set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The LA incubation period for set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cultures fed 2000 mg L−1 LA were 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 and 31 days, respectively. The glucose feeding periods were as follows: 0–5 days (set 1); 5–10 days (set 2); 10–15 days (set 3); 15–20 days (set 4); 20–25 days (set 5) and 25–30 days (set 6) (Table 1). At each incubation period, fresh cultures from a mother reactor were used to prepare the glucose controls. In experiments number 1, 3, 5 and 6 glucose was injected on days 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 (Table 1). The LA concentration (2000 mg L−1) used was based on optimum H2 yields reported in previous studies [3–5,15]. Samples for LCFA extraction were removed from the LA controls on days 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 and 31. Headspace gases, VFAs, and alcohols were monitored daily for 5 days after each glucose injection. LCFAs extraction was performed at the beginning of each incubation period (days 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 and 31) and before glucose was injected in the LA fed cultures. Hydrogen was monitored over 5 days for each incubation period. All the serum bottle batch reactors were prepared according to methods described by Saady et al. [3] and Chowdhury et al. [15]. Protocols for maintaining the cultures, preparing the serum bottles batch reactors, preparing the LCFAs (TCI, OR) and glucose stock solutions and all analytical methods were reported by Saady et al. [3] and Chowdhury et al. [15]."
4,LCFAs extraction and measurement,"2.3 LCFAs extraction and measurement Every 5 days, the LCFA levels were determined in the liquid samples removed from the batch reactors. The LCFA extraction procedure reported by Lalman and Bagley [16] for 100 mg L−1 was modified to account for levels reaching 2000 mg L−1. A mixture of 1:1:1 hexane:methyl tertiary butyl-ether (MTBE):chloroform (volume ratio) was used in the modified procedure instead of the 1:1 mixture of hexane:MTBE which was reported by Lalman and Bagley [16]. The LCFAs (C6 to C18:2 (TCI, OR)) used to prepare standard solutions were >99% pure. The percent recovery for 10–2000 mg L−1 of C6 (hexanoic acid(HA)), C8 (caprylic acid (CAA)), C10, C12, C14, C16, C18:0, C18:1 (oleic acid (OA)) and C18:2 LCFAs was greater than 95%. The quantity of LCFAs extracted into the organic phase was measured using a Varian 3800 GC configured with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a split/splitless injector. LCFAs (C6:0 to C18:2) were analyzed using a DB-FFAP 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm analytical column (J and W Scientific, USA). The injector and the FID were maintained at 240 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 1) 100 °C for 2.0 min; 2) temperature increased to 240 °C at a rate of 15 °C min−1 and 3) maintained at 240 °C for approximately 8.5 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at flow rate set at 3.5 mL min−1. The split was set off for 0.01 min, then on using a split ratio of 70:1 until completion of the analysis."
5,Genomic techniques,"2.4 Genomic techniques Microbial diversity was investigated by nested-PCR of the 16S rRNA gene using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). The microbial samples used in the T-RFLP analysis were taken from the following batch reactors: 1. untreated original culture, 2. glucose control (F1 and G1), 3. LA controls (flocculated and granular cultures fed LA (F2 and G2)) and 4. glucose plus LA treated samples (F3 and G3). Details of the protocol were previously described by Saady et al. [3]. Hae III T-RFLP profiles were derived from the raw data sets comprising the peaks which reflected the base pairs (bp) size of the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) and the area of the peaks were measured in fluorescence units. The relative abundance of each band detected was determined by computing the area of each peak as a percent of the total area. The composition of bacterial species in the mixed microbial community was estimated by the number of T-RFs (bands) which were generated in Hae III digest of 16S rRNA gene amplified by PCR genomic DNA product."
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis A principal components analysis (PCA) was performed using Statistica 9 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) to detect similarities plus differences and identify the main sources of variation between the two cultures before and after LA treatment. The PCA was conducted using glucose plus by-products concentration, LA degradation plus by-products concentration over the various incubation periods and the T-RFLP data. Only the first and second principal components (PC 1 and PC 2) are shown in the analysis. All the results in this work are reported as the mean of triplicate samples. The Tukey's paired comparison procedure was used to determine statistical differences between multiple means at the 95% confidence level [17]."
7,Flux balance analysis,"2.6 Flux balance analysis The flux balance analysis (FBA) was conducted using data from experiments which yielded the maximum H2 yield (Table 1). The metabolic network and reaction stoichiometries were modified using the model reported by Chaganti et al. [18]. The FBA was performed using the MetaFluxNet software, Version.1.8.6.2 (URL: http://mbel.kaist.ac.kr/mfn). Inputs into the model included the external substrate (glucose) plus by-products (gases, VFAs, and alcohols). Acetate or acetone production was selected as the objective function [18]. The metabolic network included acetate production (acetogens) as well as acetate consumption (aceticlastic methanogens) and hydrogen consumption (hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens) reactions. A detailed explanation of the reactions mediating the network is described by Chaganti et al. [18]."
8,Results,
9,Glucose control cultures (F1 and G1),"3.1 Glucose control cultures (F1 and G1) The maximum H2 yield (mol mol−1 glucose) for the different incubation periods under examination is shown in Table 2 . In comparison to the LA inhibited cultures, lower H2 yields were observed in the granular (G1) and flocculated (F1) glucose fed control cultures. The flocculated cultures (F1) produced more H2 than the granular cultures (G1). Significant H2 consumption was observed 1 day after each glucose injection over the duration of the experiment. The maximum H2 yield (0.68 ± 0.28 mol mol−1 glucose) attained in the granular controls (G1) was detected on day 7 (incubation period day 5 to day 10). In comparison, in the flocculated cultures (F1), the maximum yield (1.79 ± 0.35 mol mol−1 glucose) was attained on day 27 in cultures designated as set 6 (Table 2). Hydrogen was consumed and removed 5 days after each glucose injection in the granular control cultures (G1). In the glucose controls (F1 and G1) methanogens were not completely inhibited at pH 5 and hence, H2 was consumed with subsequent methane production (Table 3 and Appendix A, Fig. A and B). Notice greater methanogenic activity was detected in the granular controls compared to the flocculated cultures."
10,LA treated control cultures (F2 and G2),"3.2 LA treated control cultures (F2 and G2) LA treated granular (G2) and LA treated flocculated (F2) control cultures were incubated with LA for 0–30 days. Because no glucose was added to F2 and G2, the CH4 and H2 yields are reported on a per bottle basis and not on a per glucose basis. Granular cultures (G2) fed only LA produced a maximum of approximately 420 μmol CH4 per bottle on day 23. The H2 levels reached a maximum of approximately 30 μmol per bottle on day 1 in the flocculated culture (F2). In general low levels (μmol) of H2 were detected in the LA controls (Appendix A, Fig. A). Acetate and propionate were detected in the LA controls. The acetate concentration increased steadily over the 30-day incubation period in the LA treated cultures and peaked at approximately 750 mg L−1 in the granular culture (Appendix A, Fig. D). Acetate levels in the flocculated cultures were lower when compared to the granular cultures. Propionate was detected at low concentrations (between 100 and 150 mg L−1) in both flocculated and granular cultures (Appendix A)."
11,Cultures fed glucose and treated with LA (F3 and G3),"3.3 Cultures fed glucose and treated with LA (F3 and G3) Generally, the flocculated culture (F3) produced more H2 than the granular culture (G3) for all the different incubation periods. Maximum H2 yields of 1.9 ± 0.2 and 2.5 ± 0.2 mol mol−1 glucose were observed in granular (G3) and flocculated (F3) cultures incubated for 25 and 20 days, respectively (Table 2 and Appendix A, Fig. A). Varying the incubation time did not show any particular trend in the H2 yield. The lowest H2 yields were 1.1 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.4 mol mol−1 glucose in granular cultures (G3 incubated for 0 days) and flocculated cultures (F3 incubated for 10 days), respectively. The Tukey's test at a 95% confidence level was used to determine statistical differences between the H2 yields over the various incubation periods (Table 2). Only the H2 yields for the granular (G3) and flocculated (F3) cultures incubated for 15 days were statistically similar. The H2 yields in the granular glucose-control cultures (G1) were significantly different from the corresponding yields in the LA treated samples (G3) for all the different incubation periods. Notice the H2 yields for controls (F1) and LA treated flocculated cultures (F3) incubated for 15 days were statistically the same (Table 2). With the exception of the F3 samples (incubated for 20 days), 80% of the peak H2 levels produced by the LA treated flocculated culture (F3) remained for 5 days after injecting glucose regardless of the incubation period (Appendix A, Fig A). In the F3 samples only approximately 55% of the maximum H2 produced remained 5 days after injecting glucose. Glucose control granular cultures (G1) consumed H2 rapidly with almost 99% removal within 5 days after injecting glucose for all the different incubation periods (Appendix A, Fig A). Glucose control flocculated cultures (F1) incubated for 10 days or more were characterized by relatively stable H2 production for approximately 3 days following the addition of glucose. The glucose controls and glucose plus LA treated cultures produced CH4. In comparison, low levels were detected in the LA treated cultures when compared to the controls. As the incubation time increased, the quantity of CH4 produced in the LA treated granular and flocculated cultures (G3 and F3) increased (Table 3) to levels of 0.16 ± 0.10 and 0.02 ± 0.03 mol CH4 mol−1 glucose, respectively. In contrast, maximum levels of 0.35 ± 0.05 and 0.25 ± 0.05 mol CH4 mol−1 glucose were observed in the glucose controls (G1 and F1)."
12,Glucose degradation,"3.4 Glucose degradation Adding LA decreased the glucose initial degradation rate in the flocculated cultures by approximately 50% (from approximately 1.9 μg glucose mg−1 VSS min−1 in glucose control samples (F1) to 0.9 μg glucose mg−1 VSS min−1 in samples fed glucose and treated with LA (F3)). In comparison, the degradation rate decreased by approximately 24% in the granular cultures (from about 2.7 μg glucose mg−1 VSS min−1 in glucose control samples (G1) to approximately 2.1 μg glucose mg−1 VSS min−1 in samples fed glucose and treated with LA (G3)). The Tukey's multiple means comparison test at a 95% confidence interval [17] indicated that the initial glucose degradation rates were statistically different for the LA treated flocculated samples in comparison to their corresponding flocculated controls (data not shown). Only approximately 15% of the LA treated granular cultures were statistically different than their corresponding granular controls."
13,Volatile fatty acids production,"3.5 Volatile fatty acids production The major VFAs detected were acetate, butyrate, propionate, lactate and small quantities of formate. VFAs were produced in the granular and flocculated controls as well as the LA treated samples (Appendix A, Figs. C–G). The LA incubated cultures produced less lactate than their corresponding control samples. Generally the flocculated cultures produced less lactate than the granular cultures. In the granular and flocculated control cultures, the maximum lactate concentrations were approximately 1720 mg L−1 (G1 on day 15) and 1710 mg L−1 (F1 on day 20), respectively (Appendix A, Fig. C). In comparison, the maximum lactate concentrations attained in the LA treated granular and flocculated cultures were about 780 mg L−1 (G3 on day 5) and 540 mg L−1 (F3 on day 10), respectively. Elevated acetate concentrations were observed in the LA treated granular and flocculated cultures in comparison to the controls. The acetate levels in the granular culture were greater when compared to the controls and LA treated flocculated cultures. The maximum acetate concentrations detected were about 1370 mg L−1 on day 10 and 1320 mg L−1 on day 30 in the granular and flocculated controls, respectively (Appendix A, Fig. D). In comparison, the maximum acetate concentrations were approximately 1900 mg L−1 on day 20 and 1950 mg L−1 on day 10 in the LA treated granular and flocculated cultures, respectively. The LA inhibited flocculated cultures produced more butyrate compared to the granular cultures for 6, 26 and 31 days of incubation. The maximum butyrate concentrations under the control conditions were about 790 mg L−1 on day 2 (set 1) and 780 mg L−1 on day 14 (set 3) in the granular and flocculated control cultures, respectively. In the LA treated granular and flocculated cultures, the maximum butyrate concentrations reached approximately 980 mg L−1 on day 6 and 1030 mg L−1 on day 25, respectively (Appendix A, Fig. E). Propionate was produced in all controls. LA treated granular cultures and only set 3 (day 10 to day 15), 5 (day 15 to day 25) and set 6 (day 25 to day 30) for the LA treated flocculated cultures (Table 1 and Appendix A, Fig. F). In the flocculated controls cultures, increasing propionate levels were detected for all the glucose feeding periods. Notice the low levels in the LA treated cultures incubated with LA for 6, 11, 21 and 31 days (designated as sets 1, 2, 4 and 5). The maximum propionate concentrations attained were 640 mg L−1 on day 10 and 580 mg L−1 on day 15 in the granular and flocculated controls, respectively. In comparison, the maximum propionate concentrations detected on day 15 were 520 mg L−1 and 505 mg L−1 in the LA treated granular and flocculated cultures, respectively (Appendix A, Fig. F). Formate was produced at relatively low levels in cultures incubated for more than 5 days. Most of the formate produced was detected in the granular control cultures and no trend was observed in glucose controls or LA treated cultures (Appendix A, Fig. G)."
14,Alcohols production,"3.6 Alcohols production In the control and LA treated cultures, i-propanol and n-propanol were the only alcohols detected at levels less than 100 mg L−1. Cultures incubated with LA for 6 and 11 days produced less than 25 mg L−1 of i-propanol. The LA treated flocculated cultures produced more i-propanol than granulated cultures. Interestingly, the LA treated granular cultures produced more n-propanol (90 mg L−1) than i-propanol (Appendix A, Figs. H and I)."
15,Flux balance analysis (FBA) of H2 production,"3.7 Flux balance analysis (FBA) of H2 production An FBA was performed using data from conditions when the H2 yields attained maximum values. The metabolic reactions network of the model was reported by Chaganti et al. [18]. Hydrogen production data from the glucose controls (G1 and F1) and glucose plus LA treated (G3 and F3) granular and flocculated cultures were analyzed using the MetaFluxNet software (Version.1.8.6.2 (http://metafluxnet.kaist.ac.kr). The input included the external substrate (glucose) and the measured by-products (gases, VFAs, and alcohols). The FBA output under conditions when the maximum H2 yields were observed in the controls and LA treated cultures is shown in Fig. 1 . The order of H2 consumption (mol H2 mol−1 glucose) for the different conditions (F1, G1, F3 and G3) examined (Fig. 1) was as follows: G1 (0.88 ± 0.12) ≅ F1 (0.73 ± 0.04) > G3 (0.25 ± 0.06) ≅ F3 (0.17 ± 0.03) > G2 ≅ F2. In the glucose-control granular cultures (G1), the quantity of H2 consumed was 0.88 ± 0.12 mol of H2 mol−1 glucose [4 × 0.195 = 0.78 ± 0.09 mol H2 mol−1 glucose from CH4 production plus 0.10 ± 0.03 mol H2 mol−1 glucose in i-propanol production] compared to 0.25 ± 0.05 mol of H2 mol−1 glucose in the LA treated granular cultures (G3) [4 × 0.05 = 0.2 ± 0.05 mol H2 mol−1 glucose in the homoacetogenic reaction and 0.05 ± 0.01 mol H2 mol−1 glucose in i-propanol production]. In the flocculated glucose controls (F1), the total H2 consumed was 0.73 ± 0.04 mol H2 mol−1 glucose. Hydrogen consumption in these cultures likely proceeded via homoacetogenesis (4 × 0.1 = 0.40 ± 0.02 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) and methane production (4 × 0.055 = 0.22 ± 0.04 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) plus i-propanol production (0.11 ± 0.01 mol H2 mol−1 glucose). Based on the model, the quantity of H2 consumed via the homoacetogenic reaction in the LA treated flocculated (F3) culture was very small (0.03 ± 0.01 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) and via i-propanol 0.15 ± 0.03 mol H2 mol−1 glucose. Even though the LA treated granular and flocculated cultures showed similar quantities of H2 consumed for acetate production by homoacetogenesis and i-propanol formation, the H2 yield was less in the granular cultures. Note in the LA treated granular cultures, the quantity of n-propanol produced was fourfold greater than in the LA treated flocculated cultures."
16,Linoleic acid (LA) degradation,"3.8 Linoleic acid (LA) degradation LA was degraded in the granular (G2) and flocculated (F2) cultures (LA control) to undetectable levels within 20 (set 5) and 25 (set 6) days, respectively. The LA degradation rates in the LA controls were approximately 29 (G2) and 21 (F2) μg LA mg VSS−1 day−1. PA, MA and LUA were detected with maximum levels observed on different days (Fig. 2 ). Maximum levels of about 900 mg L−1 PA (day 25), 490 mg L−1 MA (day 25) and 83 mg L−1 LUA (day 10 (set 2)) were observed in the LA control flocculated cultures (F2) while approximately 1340 mg L−1 PA (day 25), 290 mg L−1 MA (day 25) and 49 mg L−1 LUA (day 20 (set 4)) were detected in the LA control granular cultures (G2). The PA concentration reached a stable level on day 15 in the LA control granular cultures (G2) but not until day 25 in the LA control flocculated cultures (F2). LA was degraded in the granular and flocculated cultures fed glucose (G3 and F3). By-products from the LCFA β-oxidation reaction included acetate, PA, MA and LUA. The LA concentrations detected on day 30 (set 6) were approximately 640 mg L−1 and 210 mg L−1 in the flocculated (F3) and granular (G3) cultures, respectively (Fig. 2). The LA degradation rate in the flocculated (F2) and granular (G2) LA controls cultures were about 6 μg LA mg VSS−1 day−1 and 16 μg LA mg VSS−1 day−1, respectively. Based on the degradation rates, the quantity of LA remaining after 30 days in the flocculated and granular cultures were approximately 1650 mg L−1 and 1070 mg L−1, respectively. The difference between the quantity of LA measured and the amount calculated might be due to a fraction of LA transferred into the cells or adsorbed onto the surface of the reactors. Glucose fed and LA treated granular cultures (G3) accumulated more PA than the flocculated culture (F3). Maximum PA levels of approximately 780 mg L−1 and 600 mg L−1 were observed in the granular cultures (G3) and flocculated cultures (F3) on day 20 and day 25, respectively. In contrast, low SA levels were observed (130 mg L−1) on day 20 in the granular cultures (G3) (data not shown). Trace OA levels were observed (280 mg L−1) on day 10 in the flocculated cultures (F3) (Fig. 2A). The maximum MA concentration observed in the granular (G3) and flocculated (F3) cultures was around 240 mg L−1 (day 20) and 940 mg L−1 (day 5), respectively. Peak LUA levels were about 70 mg L−1 (day 5) and 50 mg L−1 (day 25) in the flocculated (F3) and granular (G3) cultures, respectively. Generally, higher LA levels remained in the flocculated cultures than in the granular cultures (Fig. 2A and B). For the 25–30 day incubation period, greater H2 yields detected in the flocculated cultures in comparison to the granular cultures was likely attributed to higher LA levels. In the granular cultures, the decrease in H2 yield from 1.93 ± 0.15 to 1.71 ± 0.35 mol H2 mol−1 glucose when the incubation periods increased from 15–20 to 20–25 was probably associated with a decrease in the LA concentration (<500 mg L−1). Note the H2 yield decreased in the granular cultures despite an increase in the PA concentrations during the final incubation period (25–30 days)."
17,Principal components analysis (PCA),"3.9 Principal components analysis (PCA) PCA is a tool for reducing and interpreting large multivariate data sets with some fundamental linear characteristics and hence, uncovers unknown trends in a data set. A biplot is an attempt to represent both the observations and variables of multivariate data in the same graph. Each PC is a linear combination of optimally weighted observed variables. The first PC accounts for the maximum total variance in the data set, the second PC accounts for the next largest variation not already accounted for by the first PC, etc. The score maps display observations showing groups, trends, outliers and similarities among samples. Variables that have higher coefficients than others (positive or negative) on certain PC are important for the score given to that PC. The loading maps show which variables are most important for the differences observed among samples [19]. A PCA was applied to detect differences and similarities in data related to LA degradation and its by-products for the flocculated [F3 (LA plus glucose) and F2 (LA control)] and granular [G3 (LA plus glucose) and G2 (LA control)] cultures. The data set consisted of nine variables (LA degradation by-products: C6 to C18:2) and 24 cases (4 experimental conditions [F2, F3, G2 and G3] × 6 incubation periods [6, 11, 16, 21, 26 and 31 days]). The data was analyzed using LA with its degradation by-products (Fig. 3 ) and also glucose and its degradation by-products (Fig. 4 ). A biplot of PC 1LCFA and PC 2LCFA is shown in Fig. 3. In the case of LA and its degradation by-products, three principal components (PC 1LCFA, PC 2LCFA and PC 3LCFA) accounted for approximately 76% of the total variability present in the data set. Based on the loading values, PC 1LCFA was mostly correlated with LA (0.89) and OA (0.65), while PC 2LCFA was associated SA (0.65) MA (0.77) LUA (0.68) and CA (0.73). The loading values provide an indication of the contribution of each original variable to the PCs. In the case of glucose and its degradation by-products, the PCA was applied to the fermentation by-products data set (H2, CH4, lactate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, formate, i-propanol and n-propanol) for cultures F1, F3, G1, and G3 (Fig. 4). Notice F2 and G2 were fed only LA and hence, no glucose degradation by-products were expected. The first two principal components (PC 1Glucose & by-products and PC 2Glucose & by-products) accounted for 89% of the total variability in the data set. PC 1Glucose & by-products correlated with H2, acetate, butyrate, and propanol while PC 2Glucose & by-products correlated with CH4, propionate, and i-propanol. Granular and flocculated cultures fed glucose and treated with LA (F3 and G3) were closer to each other than to their corresponding glucose controls (F1 and G1) on the PCA score map (Fig. 4). The separation distance between the glucose control cultures (F1 and G1) indicates differences between the granular and flocculated cultures; however, these differences disappeared when the cultures were inhibited by LA (F3 and G3) and pH 5.0."
18,Electron mass balance,"3.10 Electron mass balance The distribution of electron equivalents in glucose and its various by-products was assessed by an electron mass balance based on glucose degradation. The mass balance accounted for 85 % to 105% of the quantity of glucose added (Appendix A, Fig. J). The net quantity of acetate produced from glucose degradation was determined as follows: amount derived in the glucose plus LA treated samples (F3 and G3) minus quantity produced from LA degradation (F2 and G2; Eq. (1)). The acetate half-reaction used in developing the electron mass balance is shown in Eq. (3). Other half-reactions used to determine the electron mass balances are provided by Rittmann and McCarty [20]. Similar calculations were repeated for glucose and its by-products. In the flocculated cultures fed glucose and treated with LA (F3), approximately 20% of the electron equivalents available in glucose were converted into H2. A large fraction of the electron equivalents were associated with the VFAs. In comparison to the flocculated cultures fed with glucose plus LA (F3), a larger percent of electron equivalents was diverted to alcohols in the granular cultures (G3).

19,Microbiological analysis,"3.11 Microbiological analysis Microorganisms detected in the original (untreated) culture and LA treated cultures (Fig. 5 ) are shown in Table 4 . A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied using the Hae III data set. The first three principal components (PC 1Microbiology, PC 2Microbiology and PC 3Microbiology) accounted for 68.5% of the total variability in the data set. The PCA score map of the T-RFLP’s data (Fig. 6 ) revealed similarities between the original untreated culture and the granular cultures (G1, G2 and G3). Notice that the original untreated culture is clustered together with the granular cultures (G1, G2 and G3) while the flocculent cultures (F1, F2 and F3) were located away from this cluster. The glucose plus LA fed (G3) and LA control (G2) granular cultures were very close in proximity to the original culture which indicates that LA addition did not change the microbiology of the granular culture; however, changes were observed in the flocculated cultures."
20,Discussion,"Hydrogen yields greater than 3 mol mol−1 glucose have been reported in anaerobic mixed cultures fed LA plus glucose [3]. To date, no reports have compared H2 production using LA inhibited and uninhibited flocculated and granular cultures. In addition, no study has provided evidence on the long-term impact of culture adaption to LA and its degradation by-products on H2 production. Flocculated cultures are amorphous with a large void volume, whereas granular cultures are tightly packed structure with an average diameter of approximately 3 mm. The major differences between the two cultures are their surface areas, micro-environments and adsorption capacities. LCFAs attach to cell walls mainly by adsorption and subsequently affect cellular activities [21]. The degree of LCFA adsorption is affected by the cell wall characteristics, the LCFA properties and environmental conditions [22]. The physical and chemical interactions between LCFAs and cellular membranes are responsible for the inhibitory effects of LCFAs on anaerobic microorganisms [12,23]. According to work by Nadais et al. [24], flocculated cultures can adsorb much more milk fat when compared to granular cultures. Even though Nadais et al. [24] showed fat adsorption differences between two different microbial structures, using cultures from difference sources is a problem associated with their work. This study demonstrated that adding 2000 mg L−1 LA and setting the initial pH at 5 inhibited the H2 consumers and diverted electron equivalents to H2 over 30 days in the granular and flocculated cultures. The H2 and CH4 profiles suggest that LA inhibited methanogens in the flocculated structure more than in the granular structure. The maximum H2 yield (mol mol−1 glucose) in the LA treated flocculated cultures (2.5 ± 0.2) was greater and significantly different from that in the LA treated granular cultures (1.9 ± 0.2) (Table 2). Differences in the local micro-environment (pH and metabolite concentration) have been reported to affect H2 metabolism in the granular and flocculated structures [25]. Large surfaces and void volumes create a larger fraction of micro-environments in flocculated cultures compared to granular structures. In granules, microorganisms respond to the local LCFA concentration between liquid and the solid (granular) interface and not to the bulk concentration [26]. The maximum H2 yield in the LA treated samples was significantly different between the granular and flocculated control cultures (Table 2). Significant statistical differences in the H2 yields confirmed that the electron fluxes diverted to the formation of various by-products were different in the two microbial structures. Moreover, although the untreated F1 and G1 cultures were derived from the same source, different microbial communities evolved over an extended period. Variations in the methanogenic activity are likely attributed to the greater inhibitory effects imposed on the flocculated cultures in comparison to the tightly packed granular structure. Hydrogen consumption was minimized in the flocculated cultures compared to the granular cultures. These results are consistent with work reported by Hwu et al. [12]. In granules, syntrophic activity is greater than in flocculated structures because of smaller distances between the H2 producers and H2 consumers [27,28]. In particular, methanogens in the core of granules are protected from the inhibitory effects of LCFAs in comparison to methanogens in the flocculated cultures. The gross amount of H2 produced and the fraction converted to acetate via homoacetogenesis cannot be established experimentally because of the presence of H2 consumers. Therefore, the quantity of H2 consumed was determined using a flux balance analysis of the experimental data. Hydrogen consumption was observed with longer incubation times in the LA treated granular cultures. This observation is in agreement with previously reported studies that syntrophs are a major sink for H2 in granular structures [28] even under conditions which are inhibitory to methanogens [29,30]. Hence, dense microbial granules support this mechanism of H2 consumption [31]. The FBA (Fig. 1) indicated that the homoacetogenic H2 consumption (mol H2 mol−1 glucose consumed) was: G3 (0.92 ± 0.14) > F1 (0.88 ± 0.03) > G1 (0.0 ± 0.0) = F3 (0.0 ± 0.0). Differences in the microbial populations between the flocculated and granular cultures were significant under the experimental conditions examined. In Fig. 5, a band at 217 bp was detected in the original untreated culture, G2 and G3 but not in the flocculated cultures (F1, F2 and F3). Similarly, a 301 bp band was detected in the original untreated culture and G1 but not in the flocculated cultures. Clostridium sp. (220 bp) and Bacillus sp. (223 bp) were observed in the flocculated (F3) but not in the granular cultures. Bacteroides sp. (261 and 266 bp) were the major organisms in the G2 and G3 cultures but not in any of the flocculated cultures. Acetobacter sp. was detected in the original untreated culture, which was obtained from the wastewater treatment facility but not in anaerobic cultures fed glucose over an extended period. Although Acetobacter sp. is an obligatory aerobe, Kim et al. [31] reported its presence in a H2 producing culture. Clostridium sp., Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium sp. and Bacteroides sp., which mediate many biochemical reactions, are likely not inhibited by LCFAs because they were detected in LCFA degrading cultures [32–34]. Studies by Kemp et al. [32] and Verhulst et al. [33] have shown that Eubacterium spp. and several strains of Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium sporogenes and Clostridium sordellii and one strain of Bacteroides sp. are able to convert LA into SA, a saturated LCFA. Various trophic groups in mixed anaerobic communities including the LCFAs oxidizing bacteria are inhibited by LCFAs [34,35]. Syntrophic acetogens and methanogens are exposed to LCFAs in flocculated cultures much more than in granular cultures. Hence, greater inhibition and higher H2 levels are expected in the flocculated cultures (Fig. 2). The greater diversity of fermentative and acidogenic bacteria (i.e., Bacteroides sp., Clostridium sp., Bacillus sp., Brevibacillus sp., and Moorella thermoacetica) detected in flocculated cultures fed glucose plus LA (F3) (Fig. 5A and Table 4) may explain the higher H2 yield compared to the granular culture (Table 2). Bacteroides, which are not inhibited by LCFAs, produce H2 because they contain H2-evolving hydrogenase similar to those in Clostridium sp. [36], thus their presence will affect the H2 yield [37,38]. M. thermoacetica is a spore-forming acetogen which grows autotrophically on H2/CO2. The FBA data did not reveal any substantial homoacetogenic H2 consumption in the flocculated cultures fed glucose and incubated with LA (F3) (Fig. 1); however, FBA analysis showed homoacetogenic activity in the granular cultures. This difference in the microbial composition can assist in explaining the difference in H2 yields between the flocculated (F3) and granular (G3) cultures. The granular cultures fed glucose plus LA (G3) was dominated by Bacillus thermoleovorans, Eubacterium sp., Clostridium sp., Butyrivibrio sp., Fusobacterium sp., and Gloeobacter sp. and Bacteroides sp. and Flavobacterium sp. (Fig. 5B and Table 4). Eubacterium sp., a non-spore former, grows autotrophically on H2/CO2 [39]. In comparison, the LA inhibited and glucose fed flocculated (F3) was dominated by Bacteroides sp., Bacillus sp., Brevibacillus sp. and Clostridium sp. In the granular cultures, the percent Bacteroides decreased in the LA controls (G2) to low levels similar to that in the glucose controls (G1) and in the granular cultures fed glucose plus LA (G3) (Table 4). The Bacillus sp. population increased in the granular LA controls (G2) to levels similar to that in the granular cultures fed LA plus glucose (G3). Eubacterium sp. was not detected in the glucose controls (G1); however, increasing levels were detected in LA controls (G2) and in cultures fed glucose plus LA (G3). The quantity of Clostridium sp. was approximately the same (6%) in all granular cultures (G3, G2, and G1). The species dominant in the LA flocculated controls were different from those dominated in the granular cultures (Table 4). Bifidobacteria sp. dominated (36%) in the LA fed granular controls, while Clostridium sp., Bacillus sp., and Bacteroides sp. (together 30%) were the major microorganisms in the LA fed flocculated controls. Alicycbacillus sp. (8%), Acinetobacter sp. (9%), and Corynebacterium sp. (7%) were present in flocculated cultures (F2) but not in the granular cultures (G2). The PCA of the glucose degradation by-products (Fig. 4) showed that the glucose controls (F1 and G1) were different from each other and each control was different from the corresponding LA treated samples (F3 and G3). However, the LA treated granular and flocculated cultures (F3 and G3) were clustered together. Adding LA changed the percentage of the dominant species in each culture (Table 4). Using LA reduced the microbial differences between the cultures obtained from different sources such that the H2 yields are maximized to similar levels [3]. The PCA for LA and its degradation by-products (Fig. 3) detected differences between the PA, MA, LUA, CAA and HA profiles in the flocculated cultures in comparison to the granular cultures. In addition, the PCA highlighted the impact of varying the incubation period. Cultures G2, G3 and F2 were closely associated in terms of PC 1LCFA and PC 2LCFA. The clusters in Fig. 3 show similarities and differences between controls and LA treated cultures. Similarities between cultures (F3) bearing the largest H2 producing capacity and with different LA incubation periods are shown as a cluster on the plot. Data supporting the high H2 producing capacity of the F3 culture is provided in Appendix A, Fig. A. Notice a large fraction of the LA incubation periods affiliated with F3 was located away from those linked with F2, G2 and G3 in terms of the PC 1LCFA PC 2LCFA (Fig. 3) and associated with C18:2 and C18:1. The results suggest that low levels of LA, MA and traces of LUA are effective inhibitors which can likely divert the electron flow towards H2 production (>2 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) in the flocculated cultures. A combination of acids derived from LA degradation over the 20–25 days of incubation caused an increase in the H2 yield. The PCA (Fig. 6) revealed a shift in the bacterial community and differences between the dominant species in the flocculated and granular cultures were caused by LA. The PCA score map and the clustering pattern shown in Fig. 6 indicate that the granular cultures were closer to the original untreated culture than the flocculated cultures. Notice, the microorganisms in the flocculated cultures were different from each other before and after treatment with LA. The H2 yields observed in this study are comparable to data reported previously for cultures inhibited by LA [15]. The results suggest that 2000 mg L−1 LA can sustain H2 production from glucose degradation for a month with an average yield of 2.2 mol H2 mol−1 glucose using flocculated cultures. Therefore, data from this study support the hypothesis of Chowdhury et al. [15] that the inhibitory effects imposed by LA are not expected to vary over an extended period. In comparison to the granular culture, the increased H2 yield in the flocculated cultures was caused by higher LA level after day 10 (Fig. 2). When compared to other LCFAs, LA and LUA are more inhibitory [40]. In the flocculated culture (F3), the LA plus LUA levels (LA = 640 and LUA = 70 mg L−1) were greater than the levels in the granular culture (G3) (LA = 210 and LUA = 50 mg L−1) on days 20–30. Although the LA levels decreased significantly in both cultures, the H2 yield remained relatively constant over a 15 day period in the granular cultures and increased in the flocculated cultures. LA inhibited cultures retained their H2 producing ability even though the LA levels decreased significantly over 30 days. Evidence describing the impact of LA and LUA on H2 consumers such as methanogens has been described by Lalman and Bagley [41] and Soliva et al. [7], respectively. Soliva et al. [7] reported that methanogens are inhibited by LUA and the same effect was observed with a combination of LUA plus MA."
21,Conclusions,"Greater inhibition of H2 consumers was observed in the LA inhibited flocculated cultures in comparison to the granular cultures. A greater fraction of the electron flow was directed towards H2 production in the flocculated cultures in comparison to the granular cultures. The flocculated cultures incubated with LA for 25 days achieved a maximum H2 yield of 2.52 ± 0.2 mol mol−1 glucose (63% of the maximum conversion efficiency of glucose to H2) compared to 1.9 ± 0.2 mol mol−1 glucose (48% conversion efficiency) in the granular cultures. In the flocculated cultures, the elevated LA levels likely caused the greater H2 yield when compared to the granular cultures. Complete methanogenic LCFA inhibition was not achieved over 30 days. LA was converted to PA, MA and LUA over 0–25 days of incubation and PA was the principal by-product. The profiles of the LA degradation by-products and the rate of LA degradation were different for flocculated and granular cultures derived from the same source. LA, PA, MA, LUA, and CAA were the most important LCFAs affecting the H2 yield. The LA treated flocculated cultures were different from each other and from the original untreated culture based on their bacterial composition; however, the LA treated granular cultures were similar to the original untreated cultures. Bacteroides sp. dominated the granular culture, while Clostridium sp. and Bacillus spp. were the major microorganisms in the flocculated cultures. A greater diversity of acidogens was detected in the LA treated flocculated cultures in comparison to the granular cultures. Although the LA levels decreased as the incubation period increased, the H2 yield reached a maximum in cultures incubated for 25–30 days."
