0,Introduction,"How to further improve the power and efficiency of the internal combustion engine has been a problem that researchers have been trying to solve in recent years [1]. Other than the traditional reciprocating engine, the Wankel rotary engine(WRE) has a higher power-to-weight ratio [2], more compact design [3], and lower noise and vibration [4] due to its unique geometric construction and revolving motion. With these advantages, the rotary engine could be widely used in the sporting car [5] and aviation aircraft [6], and utilized as a mobile electricity generator and range extender [7]. Therefore, more and more researchers are beginning to explore better performance and wider usage of the rotor engine [8]. However, the disadvantages of the rotary engine seriously impede its development furthermore. Its narrow and long combustion chamber causes severe quench effect and cooling loss [9], the linear sealing method causes leaking between the neighbor cylinder [10] and the hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of rotary engine generally poorer than that of piston engine [11]. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the solution to improve the performance of the rotary engine to propel its appliance. China’s per capita oil reserves are very low, accounting for 21% of the total world population but its oil reserves account for only 3% of the world’s oil reserve capacity and 5% of the world’s oil production capacity. Besides, with the rapid development of its road system, China is becoming a major consumer of fossil fuels. Kebin et al. numerically estimated that China’s annual oil demands for road vehicles will reach 363 million tons by 2030, which is 5 times that in the year 2000.[12] Therefore, the exploration of alternative fuels is becoming a top priority. Recently, alternative energies have attracted increasing attention from researchers [13]. The new alternative fuel must consider the reserve and the modification cost [14]. Alcohol fuels are usually in liquid fuels form at normal temperature and pressure and are widely used in engine research in recent years [15]. Methanol [16] and ethanol [17] have been widely studied as engine fuels, but both of them have lower energy density and higher latent heat of vaporization than gasoline. Comparatively, butanol [18] has a longer carbon chain and higher lower heating value(LHV). Particularly, n-butanol, one isomeride of butanol, has a similar physicochemical property to that of gasoline [19] which makes it extremely suited to use as the alternative fuel of gasoline. Huang et.al [20,21] studied the fundamental combustion characteristics of n-butanol, found that n-butanol had the fastest laminar flame speed in the four isomeride of butanol and it also had favorable combustion stability than ethanol. Wei et.al [22,23] investigated the effects of blending n-butanol in gasoline on the engine performance, they found that the addition of n-butanol was conducive to shortening the period of combustion duration and improved the stability of combustion in the part-load condition. They concluded that it made sense to use n-butanol as an alternative fuel on the engine. Naber [24] experimentally demonstrated that the maximum brake torque corresponding ignition angle of n-butanol had a little delay than that of gasoline and the performances of burning knock were very similar between these two fuels. Wigg et.al [25] concluded that the combustion performance among different alcohol-fueled engines, n-butanol had the most similar manifestation than gasoline, so did the emissions of the n-butanol-fueled engine. Hydrogen (H2) is a clean fuel that produces zero HC or greenhouse gas emissions [26]. Also, hydrogen has a small quench distance [27], therefore, it is extremely suitable for combustion in narrow spaces such as the combustion chamber of the rotary engine[28]. Su et.al [29] experimentally investigated the effect of excess air ratio on the idle performance of a hydrogen-fueled rotary engine and the test results demonstrated that only a very small amount of HC and CO2 emissions were produced from the lubricating oil combustion. Because of the long combustion chamber of rotary engine and the main flow field, an unburned zone usually appeared at the rear zone of the combustion chamber in the hydrocarbon-fueled rotary engine [30] which not only wastes energy and lowers thermal efficiency but also causes pollutant emissions. But the application of hydrogen in the rotary engine could solve this problem. The laminar flame speed of the hydrogen at stoichiometric is about 200 cm/s in the air [31], nearly seven times higher than hydrocarbon fuels. The extremely fast burning speed can promote flame propagate to the rear zone easily and eliminate the unburned zone. Another important property of hydrogen is excellent diffusivity [32]. Due to the geometric construction of the rotary engine, when the center shaft rotates one cycle, the rotor will rotate three turns, so the mixing time of fuel and air is very short. For liquid fuels, such as gasoline, it easily forms an un-homogenous mixture which greatly deteriorates the combustion. But using hydrogen as fuel, a more homogenous mixture can be formed to improve the combustion. However, a serious problem [33] of the hydrogen-fueled rotary engine is that the power is usually insufficient than that of the gasoline-fueled rotary engine, around 60–70% [34]. And the infrastructure of hydrogen usage has yet to be developed [35]. Therefore, the research interest is gradually shifted to hydrogen-blending fuel [36]. Zhang et.al [37] experimentally investigated the lean combustion performance of a hydrogen-enriched n-butanol engine. They found that the hydrogen enrichment could improve the brake thermal efficiency and extend the lean burning limit. Besides, the hydrogen-enriched n-butanol engine could achieve reduced ignition delay and accelerated combustion duration. Su et.al [38,39] conducted experiments on an n-butanol-fueled rotary engine and found that in-cylinder temperature could obviously be improved and heat release rate also could be accelerated after blending hydrogen in n-butanol. And there was a significant reduction of HC, CO and CO2 emissions with the mixing of hydrogen. The idling is an important operation condition of internal combustion engines. The nearly closed throttle in the intake pipe and very low manifold absolute pressure [40] would lead to inconsistent intake charge among neighboring cycles and high residual gas fraction, which greatly deteriorate the combustion [41]. Besides, weak in-cylinder flow movement in the combustion chamber at idle would lead to poor emission. Research has shown that although the idle condition doesn’t produce the power output, about 30% of the total fuel of the engine is consumed at the idle condition [42], thus, it is necessary to optimize the engine idling performance. Chen et.al [40] investigated the idle performance of the gasoline engine by supplying hydrogen. They found that hydrogen-enriched was an effective way to reduce cyclic variation and pollutant emissions and improve idling efficiency. Su et.al [43,44] demonstrated that reducing idle speed could decrease the total fuel flow rate and increase the economy of the rotary engine. In table 1 , there is little literature on investigating the effect of reducing the idle speed with different fuel and engine types. Based on the above analysis, idle speed is an important condition to the car, accounting for about 30% of engine operating time in the city, therefore it is necessary to solve the question of idle speed, for instance, poor emissions and high fuel consumption. Some publications have been justified that hydrogen enrichment [47] and idle speed reduction [44] are good ways to improve the performance and the economy of a gasoline-fueled rotary engine. And papers were also proved n-butanol is an ideal alternative fuel using in the engine [48]. However, the influence of reducing idle speed in a blending hydrogen n-butanol fueled rotary engine hasn’t been reported publicly. Therefore, this work attempts to study the effect of idle speed reduction on the combustion and emissions performance on a hydrogen-enriched n-butanol-fueled rotary engine for exploring the improving idle performance of the rotary engine to realize the target of energy conservation and emissions reduction, and fill the research gap and provide data support. The idle speed reduces from 2600 rpm to 2400 rpm and the volume percentage of hydrogen changes from 0 to 7.94%, and the coupling effect of them is studied."
1,Testing apparatus and method,
2,Apparatus,"2.1 Apparatus The experiment was based on a refitted single-cylinder gasoline-fueled rotary engine which is the natural aspiration, ignition and 0.16L work displacement. Fig. 1 and Table 2 show the schematic diagram and specification of this rotary engine, respectively. The original magneto ignition system was replaced by an electronically controlled ignition system. Meanwhile, an independently controllable dual fuel management system was added on the intake port and replaced the carburetor to realize the real-time control of spark timing and fuel injection. This fuel supply system can realize the precise control of fuel quantity, which means the excess air ratio and blending hydrogen percentage become manageable. The injection duration of hydrogen and n-butanol is monitored by a specially developed electronic control module (ECM), and the injection pressure remains constant at each experiment. At the same time, the spark module controlling the sparking time is monitored by this ECM also. Besides, the required parameters are set by a calibration computer cooperative with ECM.Table 3. High purity fuel gases were used to ensure the accuracy of the test, the purity of the adopted hydrogen and n-butanol was 99.99% and 99.995%, respectively. To guarantee the constant excess air ratio and blending hydrogen percentage, hydrogen is continuously and stably supplied by the constant pressure stainless steel pipe whose pressure is 0.3 MPa. Because this experimental rotary engine doesn’t have an individual lubricating system, it is necessary to blend a small amount of lubricating oil into n-butanol. The volume of lubricating oil is around 2% of that of n-butanol. Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram of the test system. A Powerlink CAC6 alternating current electrical dynamometer, which controls and measures the speed and power output of the engine, is used to load the engine. The n-butanol consumption is recorded by a FC2210 fuel mass flow meter, and the mass flow of hydrogen and air are respectively measured by 20 N060 thermal mass flow meter and D07-19BM thermal mass flow meter. 300 continuous steady-state cycle data were recorded and statistically analyzed in each condition to guarantee the accuracy of the experiment. The sequential in-cylinder pressure was measured by a Kistler 6117BCD17 piezoelectric pressure transducer combined on a spark plug. A 23 (24–1) teeth trigger wheel, cooperating with a photoelectric magnetic sensor mounted on the engine output shaft, was used to measure the crank angle signal data. The data of pressure and crank angle signal are recorded by the KiBox combustion analyzer. A Horiba MEXA-7100D emissions analyzer was used to measure the value of HC CO and NOx emissions. The real-time excess air ratio is monitored by a Horiba MEXA-730 L wide-range lambda analyzer with an oxygen sensor inserted into the exhaust pipe. Table 3 shows the parameters, sensitivity and measurement uncertainties of these above facilities."
3,Testing method,"2.2 Testing method The tested idle speeds are chosen as 2600 and 2400. The idle speed provided by the manufacturer is 3000 rpm and the idle speed range of small-sized WRE is 2000–3000 rpm normally. Furthermore, the WRE can operate stably at idling speeds below the original value with the mixing of hydrogen. Therefore, these two speeds are selected to experiment. And the blending hydrogen volume percentage βH2 was changed from 0 to 7.94%. Firstly, the engine was warmed up with n-butanol/air mixtures and maintain it to ensure a similar heat transfer. After the warming-up, the idle speed of the n-butanol-fueled rotary engine was adjusted to 2600 rpm and 2400 rpm. At both idling conditions, the βH2 increases from 0 to 7.94%. The global excess air ratios are kept at stoichiometric under all tested conditions. With gradually increasing hydrogen fraction, the mass flow of n-butanol was decreased by changing the parameter of ECM to ensure the overall excess air ratio keeps at the stoichiometric ratio. To maintain the accuracy and repeatability of this work, the average data of 300 consecutive cycle, including in-cylinder, fuel consumption and emission, was recorded at the stably operated engine conditions. In addition, in this work, the constant spark timing was adopted as 15°CA BTDC which is the original spark timing. The blending hydrogen volume percentage (βH2) and total excess air ratio (λ) are defined as: (1) βH2=(VH2×ρH2×LH2)/(VH2×ρH2×LH2+mgas×Lgas) (2) λ=(Vair×ρair)/(VH2×ρH2×AFst, H2+mn-butanol×AFst,n-butanol) In Eqs. (1) and (2), VH2 and Vair are the volume flow rates(L/min) of hydrogen and air, respectively; ρH2 and ρair are the densities (g/L) of hydrogen and air; AFst, H2 and AFst,n-butanol are the stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratios of hydrogen and air; mn-butanol is the measured n-butanol mass flow rate(g/min)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Cyclic variation,"3.1 Cyclic variation Combustion stability has a significant effect on engine performance. The coefficient of variation in engine speed(CoVn) is crucial for stabilizing engine idle speed operation. CoVn is defined as [42]: (3) Co V n = ≪ ∑ n k n i - ¯ n ¯ 2 / k - 1 / n ¯ ∗ 100 % In Eq.(3), ni (rpm) is the instantaneous engine speed of the tested engine in the ith cycle, n(rpm) is the average speed in total k cycles, and k is the number of consecutive testing cycles (k ≥ 150 and k = 300 in this work). Fig. 3 depicts the variation of CoVn with βH2 at various idle speeds. It is illustrated in Fig. 3 that the CoVn is increasing with the reduction of idle speed at a specified hydrogen blending level or with the reduction of βH2 at a constant idle speed. When βH2 changes from 0 to about 5%, CoVn greatly reduces over 80% than the original which means passengers could have a more comfortable experience on the car at this idle condition, and the decline slope of CoVn becomes gradual with the continued increase of βH2. The above phenomenon could be explained by the following reasons. The study [49] demonstrated the cyclic variation is attached to the burning rate, and hydrogen as a high combustion speed fuel could shorten the combustion process, which lowers the likelihood of cyclic variation. So, with mixing a few hydrogens, CoVn has a marked reduction. But when βH2 exceeds 5%, excess hydrogen has few effecting to lower the CoVn. Fig. 3 also suggests that the reduced idle operating condition leads to higher CoVn than the original at a specific hydrogen-enriched level. In pure n-butanol fueled condition, the CoVn in 2400 rpm increased by more than 25% compared with that at 2600 rpm. It could be explained that with the idle speed decreasing, the weakened movement intensity of airflow in-cylinder would increase residual gas fraction and hardly form a homogenous mixture, which results in the slower flame propagation and the higher probability of misfire, therefore there is a higher cyclic variation. In particular, when the βH2 exceeds 8%, the CoVn are almost equal in the two idle conditions, about 1.3%. It illustrates that the negative effects of reducing idle speed on cyclic variation can be nearly eliminated in high hydrogen blending level."
6,Fuel energy flow rate,"3.2 Fuel energy flow rate The total fuel energy flow rate (Ef) is an important economic index of idle speeding in a hydrogen-enriched engine. Ef of the tested engine is defined as Eq (4): (4) E f = ∑ i = 1 K m i L i where mi and Li represent the mass flow rates and low heating values of ith fuel, namely the mass flow rates of n-butanol and hydrogen (kg/h), and the low heating values of n-butanol and hydrogen (Lg = 44 MJ/kg, LH2 = 120 MJ/kg) in this paper. Fig. 4 displays the variation of Ef with βH2 at various idle speeds. Fig. 4 illustrates that both reducing rotary engine idle speed and blending hydrogen in fuel are beneficial to improve the fuel economy of the engine in idle conditions. Specifically, the total fuel flow rate decreases from 24.57 MJ/h at pure n-butanol and 2600 rpm idle speed to 19.35 MJ/h at βH2 = 7.94% and 2400 rpm idle speed, a reduction of about 21%. It could be interpreted as although reducing idle speed would result in slower flame propagation which causes more cooling loss, but it also means less fuel is needed to keep the engine running and less kinetic energy is needed to push the rotor. The positive effect offsets the negative effect. Therefore, the engine shows a better economic efficiency at a reduced idle speed. It also can be seen from Fig. 4 that blending hydrogen in n-butanol is an effective way to lower the total fuel flow rate. The reason is that hydrogen as a high burning speed fuel could propel the combustion process which means less cooling loss and higher thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the shorter quench distance of hydrogen is conducive to burn fully in the narrow chamber of rotary engine. In particular, in Fig. 4, the more dramatic reduction occurs in the range of βH2 = 6% to 8% than βH2 less than 6% (the average slope of the two is 1.17 and 0.39 respectively in 2600 rpm), which can be explained that in the testing hydrogen-enriched range, high blending hydrogen level condition provides enough hydrogen to promote combustion and abundant hydrogen can replace n-butanol in a way."
7,Combustion analysis,"3.3 Combustion analysis Fig. 5 illustrates the flame development period (CA0-10) with βH2 at various idle speeds. It can be found that with the increase of idle speed and βH2, the period of flame development shows a trend of shortening. CA0-10 decreases from about 64°CA at the pure n-butanol condition to about 54°CA at βH2 = 8% in 2400 rpm idle condition, a reduction of about 15.6%. The reason for this trend is that hydrogen has the characteristic of low ignition energy [50] leading to the flame kernel of hydrogen is extremely easier to form than that of n-butanol. Therefore, blending hydrogen in fuel could remarkably shorten the period of flame development. It also illustrates that reducing idle speed would result in a longer CA0-10, which reason is that reducing engine speed will weaken flow movement and form un-homogeneous mixtures which result in flame kernel forming difficult. However, the effect is very limited because of not a big gap between two idle speeds. Especially, the decline of CA0-10 is sharp in high blending hydrogen level as shown in Fig. 5, the bilateral average slopes of βH2 = 5.88% are 0.88 and 2.59. This is because that when hydrogen content exceeds a certain proportion, the leading role of fuels would change gradually. Both of the long combustion chamber of the rotary engine and feeble air-flow at idle condition would result in a longish flame propagation period [51]. The brake thermal efficiency would be reduced by the longer flame propagation period, therefore it is necessary to shorten the CA10-90. Fig. 6 shows the flame propagation period (CA10-90) with βH2 at various idle speeds. As shown in Fig. 6, the flame propagation period would extend at a reduced idle speed in the same blending hydrogen level. The reason is that improved speed can strengthen the intensity of flow movement in the combustion chamber at idle conditions, which promotes the homogenous mix of fuel–air and speed up flame propagation. However, the negative impact of reducing idle on CA10-90 is very limited on such difference in speed. It also can be found in Fig. 6 that CA10-90 can be obviously shortened by blending hydrogen, reducing by about 10% at βH2 = 7.94% than that in βH2 = 0. This is mainly due to the extremely high laminar flame speed of the hydrogen[52], about 4 times than n-butanol in equivalence ratio [53]. At the same time, the combustion of hydrogen would promote the formation of O, H and OH radicals in flame front which is also conducive to the accelerating combustion of n-butanol [54]. Furthermore, the gap between two idle conditions could be shortened in the high blending hydrogen level, which means hydrogen enrichment can offset part negative effects of reduced idle speed in a way. Fig. 7 is the maximum in-cylinder temperature (Tmax) changing with βH2 at different idle speeds. Due to a lower compression ratio of the tested rotary engine and severe cooling loss in idle speed conditions, the Tmax of the tested rotary engine is usually lower than the traditional piston engine. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that in a specific βH2, increasing speed would improve the maximum in-cylinder temperature. The part reason is that at idle speed conditions, increasing idle speed can strengthen the flow movement in the combustion chamber and promote flame propagation, which means a lot of heats would be released closer to the top dead center (TDC). Higher combustion constant-volume degree leads to higher Tmax. Besides, more fuels are needed to maintain the normal operation of the engine at high idle speed conditions, so the higher Tmax would be produced based on more fuels. The Tmax would increase with the βH2 at a constant idle speed, increasing from 776 at the pure n-butanol condition to 821 at βH2 = 7.94%. an increase of 5.8%. This is because that hydrogen as an extremely fast burning fuel can greatly promote the development and propagation of mixture combustion which causes combustion to have a higher constant-volume degree and lower cooling loss, so there is a higher Tmax at a bigger βH2. It also can be seen from Fig. 7 that the Tmax differences of various idle speed conditions at high blending hydrogen conditions are smaller than that of lower conditions. It demonstrates that the positive effects of blending hydrogen greatly offset the negative effects of reducing idle speed, so the side effects on Tmax sourcing from reducing speed is acceptable."
8,Untreated emissions,"3.4 Untreated emissions Due to unique its geometric structure, the rotary engine has a narrow and long combustion chamber which is not conducive to flame propagation and heats utilization of fuel. Meanwhile, the severe quench effects caused by the narrow combustion chamber lead to extremely high HC emissions. Furthermore, the linear sealing of the rotary engine leads to more serious leakage between neighbor cylinders, which would cause residual gas to deteriorate the combustion of the previous cylinder. Besides, the combustion chamber of the rotary engine revolves continually which results in a flow field with the same direction of rotation, therefore it is difficult for the flame propagating in reverse rotational direction to reach the rear zone of the combustion chamber. The presence of the unburned zone in the rotary engine also generates more HC emissions. All of the above reasons cause poorer emissions of the rotary engines than the traditional piston engine. Fig. 8 is the CO emissions with βH2 at various idle speeds. As illustrated in Fig. 8 that CO emission is negatively correlated with engine speed at the idle conditions. The reason is that reducing idle speed will cause a weaker flow field movement and a more un-homogenous mixture. Therefore, a large amount of CO is formed at the fuel-rich zone in the combustion chamber. However, the side effect of reducing idle speed on CO emission is not significant, with a maximum increase of less than 2%. It is also can be seen from Fig. 8 that CO emission is extremely decreased by blending hydrogen in fuel and more CO would be eliminated by mixing more hydrogen, a reduction of about 84.2% when βH2 changes from 0 to 7.94%. The part reason is that CO is slow to oxidize unless there are some hydrogen-containing species present and small quantities of H2O and H2 can have a tremendous effect on the oxidation rate, so more H2O, produced by the combustion of hydrogen, facilitate the conversion of CO [55]. The other reason is that the addition of hydrogen replaces some n-butanol which means a reduced amount of elemental carbon in the fuel. In particular, the emissions of CO are extremely high when fueled with pure n-butanol due to the intrinsic emission problem of the rotary engine and the influence of low speed, and the heat release of hydrocarbons combustion mainly depends on the post-oxidation of CO [55], which is another reason of low-temperature in-cylinder. Therefore, blending hydrogen in n-butanol is an effective way to lower the emissions of CO. Fig. 9 depicts the HC emissions with βH2 at various idle speeds. It is shown by Fig. 9 that higher HC emissions appear at reduced idle speed at the same βH2 conditions. It could be explained that there is an unburned zone at the rear zone of the combustion chamber in the rotary engine, and reduce idle speed will cause a weaker flow movement and slower flame propagation, therefore, it is harder for the slower flame to spread to the back of the combustion chamber. So, more HC emissions are produced at a distensible unburned zone in reduced idle speed. Besides, such high HC emissions mean that there is a probability of misfire, therefore the CoVn is high in pure n-butanol fueled conditions at both idle speeds shown in Fig. 3. It is also can be seen from Fig. 9 that there are extremely high HC emissions in pure n-butanol fueled conditions at both idle speeds, about 55,000 and 64000 ppm, due to severe quenching effect caused by the narrow combustion chamber and biggish unburned zone caused by weak flow movement at idle. However, with the increase of βH2, HC emissions decrease sharply, from about 64,000 and 55000 ppm to less than 30000 ppm when βH2 changes from 0 up to about 8%, a reduction of 55% and 50% respectively. The emission reduction mainly due to the extremely fast flame speed and shorter quenching distance of hydrogen. Another reason is the decrease in total elemental carbon in the fuel. The above properties of hydrogen largely offset the possibility of producing HC at the idle condition. In particular, with the increase of βH2, the HC emissions difference between two idle speed decrease continuously, from about 10000 ppm reduce to approximate equal in the range of testing. This phenomenon suggests that hydrogen can not only reduce HC emissions of n-butanol fueled rotary engine, but also greatly reduce the negative impact of idle speed on HC emissions. Fig. 10 shows the NOx emission with βH2 at various idle speeds. The formation of NOx is closely related to the in-cylinder temperature [56]. The maximum temperature in-cylinder is low, hence, there not much NOx was exhausted in the testing conditions as shown in Fig. 10. It can be found that the NOx emissions at 2600 rpm are almost equal to that of at 2400 rpm in the same hydrogen-enriched level. And with the βH2 increasing, the quantity of NOx emission has minor improvement. The above trend can be explained by the following reasons. High idle speed results in stronger flow movement and fast flame propagation, therefore more heat intensively release near TDC. Hydrogen has greatly fast laminar flame speed and blending hydrogen combustion also improves the amount of O, H and OH radicals in the flame front, both of which can promote the mixture combustion in a smaller space and improve the combustion constant-volume degree. However, the temperature in the cylinder is low at the idle condition, so even if blending hydrogen in fuel is adopted, it will not be obtained high NOx emissions. In conclusion, although idle speed reduction causes the deterioration of combustion, blending hydrogen can offset the negative effect of it and realize lower pollutant emissions. The coupling effect of them completes the target of energy conservation and emission reduction to meet the increasingly stringent emission requirements. Compared to the previous study[43,45], reducing idle speed and enriched hydrogen are also effective to improve the n-butanol fueled rotary engine performance. And the methods have similar effects between n-butanol fueled and gasoline-fueled rotary engine, slightly better for n-butanol. Therefore, n-butanol is a feasible alternative fuel used in the rotary engine."
9,Conclusion,"This work tried to experimentally study the effect of hydrogen enrichment and idle speed reduction on the combustion and emissions characteristics of an n-butanol fueled rotary engine in the stoichiometric ratio condition. The enriched hydrogen volume fractions vary from 0 to 7.94% and the testing idle speeds include 2600 and 2400 rpm. The main findings of this study are summarized below: 1. CoVn decreased significantly with the addition of hydrogen in each idle speed condition, from 8.44% in pure n-butanol fueled condition to 1.36% in βH2 = 7.94% condition at 2400 rpm. At the same time, although reducing idle speed will lead to an increase in CoVn, the negative effect of reducing idle speed on CoVn, could be eliminated by the increase of βH2. 2. Both reducing idle speed and blending hydrogen are effective ways to decrease the total fuel flow rate. The total fuel flow rate changes from 24.57 MJ/h in pure n-butanol fueled condition at 2600 rpm to 19.35 MJ/h in βH2 ~ 8% condition at 2400 rpm. 3. Both CA0-10 and CA10-90 are slightly prolonged by reducing idle speed. Hydrogen-enriched can shorten about 20% duration of CA0-10 and 10% duration of CA10-90 respectively. Because of the shortening of CA0-10 and CA10-90, the more heats release intensively near the TDC. Therefore, the Tmax is negatively correlated with CA0-10 and CA10-90. Both blending hydrogen and increasing idle speed are conducive to improve the Tmax. 4. With the addition of hydrogen and the increase of idle speed, the CO and HC emissions decrease obviously. When βH2 ups to 7.94%, the reduction ratio is about 80% and 50% of the pure n-butanol fueled conditions respectively. Meanwhile, although reducing idle speed will deteriorate the emissions of HC and CO, the negative effects of reducing idle speed are almost compensated when βH2 passes about 7%. The NOx emission is very low, less than 20 ppm even if βH2 ups to about 8% at the idle condition. From what has been discussed above, the coupling effect of hydrogen enrichment and idle speed reduction could realize energy conservation and emissions reduction at the same time. And when blending hydrogen to a certain level, the negative effect of reducing idle speed could be eliminated. Besides, n-butanol is a good alternative fuel using in the rotary engine. Therefore, these three methods can be considered as very promising for use in cars. In the future, we will further investigate the application of hydrogen and n-butanol at more different conditions in the rotary engine, so as to broaden the application possibilities of the power plant."
