0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is constituted of natural polymers that are formed by carbohydrates like cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (Tekin and Karagöz, 2013), which are responsible for its energetic content. Worldwide, various residues based on lignocellulosic biomass are discarded inappropriately as agricultural residue, urban wastes, wood, forestry, energy crops, and animal manure (Roy and Dias, 2017). The conversion of these wastes into low-cost biofuels is an important alternative to minimize environmental problems, especially climate changes. Brazil is the world’s largest producer of ethanol from sugarcane (producing approximately 30.4 × 109 L/y in 2018) with approximately more than 400 ethanol production sites spread throughout the country (Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento, 2019). Consequently, the production of bagasse (166 × 106 t/y) after crushing the canes to extract the juice, which generates both sugar and ethanol, occurs on a large scale in a great part of the country (Ramos and Nachiluk, 2017). Currently, the bagasse is being burned and more recently used to generate electrical power or to produce cellulosic ethanol. The conversion of this residue into a liquid, with higher energy density than the solid bagasse, is relevant to facilitate its transport, besides provide another alternative for liquid biofuels production with low costs. The diversification of products from sugarcane bagasse is relevant to add value to this important waste and to improve the energetic matrix of the countries which have planted sugarcane on large scale as Brazil, India, China, and others. Pyrolysis and thermal liquefaction (TL) are thermochemical treatments that show considerable potential to convert solid biomass to liquid products, with industrial interest. When biomass has high water content, the hydrothermal liquefaction becomes an interesting conversion route, because the biomass can be used directly without the application of a drying step, differently than pyrolysis (Toor et al., 2013). The use of water as a liquefaction solvent presents advantages, like low cost, high polarity, and acting simultaneously as a reagent and catalyst (Fang and Xu, 2014). The use of water also has some disadvantages, such as high operation conditions (200–370 °C and 40–200 bar) to achieve its subcritical state with especial solvency, besides the low yield of recovered biocrude (less than 40%). This biocrude also has a low heat of combustion, which is a consequence of high water content and oxygenated compounds. The large number of steps involving in producing this biocrude after the liquefaction, using organic solvents for extraction, increases the costs, and generates aqueous effluents to be treated (Huang and Yuan, 2015). Conversion routes that make use of different solvents like ethanol (Ahmed et al., 2018) and mixtures of ethanol-water (Pan et al., 2018) in the liquefaction process have been investigated, improving significantly the yield and quality of the biocrude, such as a higher heat of combustion. Besides this, aliphatic alcohols react like hydrogen donors and possess the ability to promote hydro-alkylation. The main advantages of these alcohols are the greater solubility of compounds, due to their smaller dielectric constants than water, easy separation by distillation when used in excess, low corrosivity, donation of hydrogen which stabilizes the formed radicals in thermal cleavage and higher yields of biocrude above 40% (Brand et al., 2013). In the case of sugarcane bagasse liquefaction, the use of ethanol has another interesting aspect, involving a circular economy. The biocrude can be used for sugarcane plantation activity, reducing the costs of bioethanol because it can be used as biofuel in the machines of planting, harvesting, milling, transport, and fermenting of the sugarcane. The most commonly used catalysts in biomass depolymerization processes through pyrolysis or thermal liquefaction are alkaline metals and mixtures of Ni/Ru. Previous research discussed the decomposition of cellulose in a hydrothermal liquefaction process using Na2CO3 as an alkaline catalyst and a catalyst of reduced nickel with different temperatures (200–350 °C). The authors showed that the catalysts presented inhibition activities of the char formation increasing the yield of biocrude (Minowa et al., 1998). Another interesting study used Na2CO3 as a catalyst for the hydrothermal liquefaction of wood, obtaining biocrude containing hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, hydroxyl-benzenes, and esters (Qian et al., 2007). It is important to point out that CaCO3 has not been studied as a catalyst for biomass thermal liquefaction, and the present study is the first work with this purpose in the literature. The use of catalysts based on wastes with CaCO3 active phase has caught our interest, harnessing the richness of residual minerals, reducing their environmental impact, and giving them a complimentary use, contributing to the reduction of the costs in the processes for biofuel production. Noteworthy are the fishing residues that are generated in great scale during the fishing activity in the coastal cities, such as the crude carapaces of the crabs (Ucides cordatus) and the clams of the bivalve mollusks (Mytella falcate), that will be used in this present study as a source of alkaline catalysts based on CaCO3. Additionally, the shells of crabs and mussels can be considered as an environmental problem due to the great volume that is being discarded in landfills without pre-treatment. Joint work involving fishermen’s cooperatives and seafood industries can be a feasible alternative for the collecting and production of large quantities of residue catalysts to be used for biocrude production. The crustaceans (crab, shrimp, etc.) and mollusks (mussels, oysters, scallops, etc.) are marine animals mainly composed of CaCO3. As they are marine filters, these residues usually contain other heavy metals that can contribute to the catalytic activity, besides CaCO3. In the case of crustaceans, volatile and organic molecules besides nitrogenous biopolymers are also present, mainly in chitin and chitosan form (Mathur and Narang, 1990). These organic portions can be considered as sources of nitrogen and hydrogen when degraded, interfering positively in the quality of the produced biocrude. This study aims to investigate the effect of different solvents (water, hydrous and anhydrous ethanol) on the yield of the liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse and on the chemical composition of the biocrude, with and without the use of residual catalyst based on CaCO3 (fishing wastes of mussel and crab). The results showed the possibility of giving a destination to the residues, minimizing their environmental impact, and generating new types of liquid biofuels through sugarcane bagasse and fishery residues. It should be noted that in the present paper there is no commitment to present a new alternative, better than co-generation power or cellulosic ethanol production, for sugarcane bagasse uses regarding economic or environmental aspects. The contribution of this study is to show an innovative and low-cost alternative to convert this solid waste into a liquid biofuel and biochar with greater functionalities, liable for industrial use, adding value to the ethanol industry. This process can be used when there is a demand for low-cost liquid biofuel and probably when there is a surplus of electricity."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The anhydrous ethanol was purchased in the local market (Anidrol®, 99.5%), while the hydrous ethanol was acquired at a gas station in the region of Belo Horizonte/MG/Brazil because this alcohol has been used as biofuel for flex-fuel cars. A commercial establishment (Belo Horizonte/MG/Brazil) kindly provided the sugarcane bagasse after the milling extraction of the sugarcane juice. The calcium carbonate used for a comparative study with the waste catalysts is an analytical grade (CRQ Química). The carapaces of the crab (Ucides cordatus) and the shells of the bivalve mollusk (Mytella falcate) were collected from the fishing wastes on the island ’Ilha de Deus’ (Recife/Pernambuco/Brazil)."
3,Processing and characterization of the bagasse,"2.2 Processing and characterization of the bagasse The bagasse was dried in an oven at 105 °C for storage without microbial degradation. After, the fibbers were cut, crushed in a hammer mill, and sieved. The pre-processed bagasse was analyzed to measure the humidity and ash content, according to ASTM E1756-08 and ASTM E1755-01 standards, respectively. The humidity and ash contents were used to calculate the percentage of organic material, through equation (1), as follows: (1) (%) Organic Material = 100 – [(% Humidity) + (% Ash content)] The higher heating value of the biomass was determined according to ASTM D240 standard, using a calorimeter IKA, model C200 in which the sample was burned in the presence of oxygen in excess. The bagasse samples were analyzed by elementary analysis on PerkinElmer brand equipment model CHN PE2400 . The bagasse ashes were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy using a Rigaku NEX DE VS spectrometer 60 kV to evaluate their compositions expressed in oxide contents."
4,Preparation and characterization of the catalysts,"2.3 Preparation and characterization of the catalysts The carapaces of the crustacean Ucides Cordatus (crab) and the bivalve mollusk Mytella falcate (mussel) were washed in running water, following by a wash in distilled water. They were dried in an oven at 110 °C for 1 h, crushed by a knife mill with sieves of 70 Tyler/Mesh. The main compounds and crystalline phases present in the waste catalysts were evaluated by X-ray diffraction using a SHIMADZU equipment, model XRD-7000 X-RAY. The chemical composition, expressed in oxides, was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy using a Rigaku NEX DE VS spectrometer 60 kV after the calcination of the catalysts."
5,Liquefaction reactions and catalyst test,"2.4 Liquefaction reactions and catalyst test The liquefaction processes were performed in duplicate or triplicate, using water, anhydrous, and hydrous (96%) ethanol as different solvents over both residual catalysts (crab and mussel), and without catalysts (blank). Pure calcium carbonate was also tested as catalyst for a comparative study. The thermal liquefaction of the sugarcane bagasse was carried out in a reactor (Parr Instruments) of stainless steel (316 L) with a capacity of 600 mL. The reactor was first filled with approximately 10 g of processed sugarcane bagasse and mixed with 100 mL solvent and approximately 1 g of catalyst. The reactor was closed and purged with nitrogen at room temperature, following by pressurizing until 10 bar N2. The reaction occurred under constant mechanical stirring (100 rpm), at 300 °C for 30 min. After the reaction turns out, the reactor was cooled down and depressurized. The percentual yield of biocrude (WB%), biochar (Wbiochar%), the conversion of the sugarcane bagasse (X%), and the recovered energy were calculated using the following equations (2)–(5) similar to the literature (Mazaheri et al., 2010): (2) WB (%) = (mbiocrudex100)/mSB (3) Wbiochar (%) = ((mRSolid-mcat)/mSB)×100 (4) X (%) = ((mSB-mRSolid)/mSB)×100 (5) RE (%) = (HHVbiocrude x mbiocrude)/(HHVbagasse x mSB) Where: • WB (%) is the percentage of biocrude; • mbiocrude is the mass of the biocrude after rotary evaporation to eliminate the excess of solvent (g); • Wbiochar is the percentage of biochar, obtained as a solid, subtracting the inorganic material originating from the catalyst and inserted to the carbonaceous structure; • X (%) is the conversion of the bagasse into liquids and gas; • mSB is the mass of the sugarcane bagasse (g); • mRSolid is the mass of the solid products, which means biochar plus the including the inorganic phase of the catalyst (g); • mcat is the mass of the catalyst added to the process (g); • RE (%) is the percentage of the recovered energy and • HHV is the higher heating value of the biocrude and the bagasse (MJ.kg−1) As already mentioned, for a comparative study, liquefaction tests catalyzed with pure calcium carbonate (CaCO3-p) using anhydrous and hydrous ethanol were performed. The test was not carried out using water because the quantifications using this solvent have many uncertainties and it is not the focus of this study. 2.4.1 Products separation The liquid product that was obtained at the end of the process was separated from the solid through vacuum filtration. The excess of solvent was removed by rotary evaporation at a temperature of 40 °C, under reduced pressure. The solid residue, obtained after filtration, was treated ultrasonically in acetone and dried at 100 °C. The acetone was removed by rotary evaporation, recovering another portion of biocrude, which was mixed with the biocrude recovered after elimination of the liquefaction solvent used in excess. In the case of the process with water (hydrothermal liquefaction), the product was subjected to a liquid-liquid extraction for 4 stages, using diethyl ether and ethyl acetate as extraction solvents. The extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporation, obtaining the recovered biocrudes. As biocrude has polar compounds which are soluble in water, this extraction presented low yield. Different solvents for biocrude extraction were tested without a solution to this problem. 2.4.2 Biocrude characterization: water content and HHV The biocrudes were characterized by their higher heating value (HHV), according to the ASTM D240 standard, using the IKA model C200 calorimetric pump. The water contents of biocrude samples were determined using a coulometer (831 KF METROHM) for coulometric titration according to ASTM-D6304 methodology. 2.4.3 Determination of biocrude composition by gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry The identification of the compounds present in the biocrude was performed using a GC/MS spectrometer from Shimadzu; model QP5050 with an auto-injector AOC-20i-Shimadzu. The samples were analyzed on a Petrocol column (apolar phase) (97 m × 0.25 mm x 0.5 μm), using a He-flow of 0.8 mL.min−1; an injection volume of 1 μL in split mode (1:10); injector temperature and interface were 280 and 260 °C respectively. The temperature increased from 30 °C (10 min) to 185 °C with a gradient of 2.5 °C.min- 1, after which the oven was heated until 260 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C.min−1, which temperature was maintained for 170 min. The energy of ionization was 70 eV in the system of electron ionization , within a range of 45–500 m/z from 12 to 170 min. The identification of the compounds was performed by the comparison of the obtained mass spectra of the products with the mass spectra of the library of WILEY 229 and NIST 05, considering similarities above 85%, using the software GC/MS Solution (Shimadzu). The concentration of each substance was reported as the area percentage of each compound based on the total area, which is considered a semi-quantitative analysis. 2.4.4 Determination of the content of Ca leached from the catalyst to biocrude About 100 mg of biocrude sample was weighed in a reaction tube, and in each were added 3 mL of HNO3, 1 mL HCl and 2 mL H2O2. The tubes were placed in a microwave-assisted digester for heat treatment up to 210 °C for 15 min with a holding for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, the extracts were transferred quantitatively to conical tubes and the mass was measured up to 40 g of the final solution. Standard calcium solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0.10; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 2.50 and 5.00 mg.L−1, the total volume was completed with a 2% acid analytical blank solution (HNO3:HCl (3:1)). The Ca content of the solutions were analyzed in an Atomic Absorption Spectrometry equipment (PerkinElmer, Analyst 400) at a wavelength of 422.7 nm and with an acetylene-air flame, with respective flow rates of 2.5 and 10.0 L.min−1. The analytical curve was used to quantify the Ca content in the biocrude samples. 2.4.5 Characterization of biochar Biochars were analyzed by their higher heating value (HHV), according to the ASTM D240 method, using the IKA model C200 calorimetric pump."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the sugarcane bagasse,"3.1 Characterization of the sugarcane bagasse The chemical composition of the sugarcane bagasse can vary with different types of cultivated sugarcane, different fertilizers, and herbicides used during cultivation, besides the natural factors, such as water, climate, and soil (Cordeiro et al., 2009). The mineral content depends on the type of biomass and comprises a value between 2 and 25% of the total mass of the solids, generally consisting of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Co, Zn, and Cu in oxides or salts like chlorides, carbonates, phosphates, and sulphates. In the case of the studied sugarcane, the chemical composition is presented in Table 1 . Due to the previous drying process of the bagasse, low water content was found (Table 1). The ash content (3.8%) was within the expected value described in the literature (Rafiqul et al., 2000). These researchers found a similar value (2.3%) for their sample. The organic materials content of the bagasse (96.2% Table 1) was calculated according to Equation (1), from the values of the humidity and ash content. This provides information about the high quantity of biopolymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, etc.) present in the sample that can be converted into biocrude with a good yield."
8,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of the catalysts Table 2 shows the composition of the catalyst based on the shells of mussel and crab in the form of oxides, obtained by analysis on the ash by X-ray fluorescence. The analyses of these fishing residues showed a high amount of CaO, equivalent to 98.6 wt.% (mussel) and 88.4 wt.% (crab), respectively. Besides CaO, the presence of other oxides in lower concentrations (MgO, SrO, Fe2O3, Al2O3, P2O5, SiO, and S) was observed, which is considered as impurities contained in the catalysts but can impact their performance. In the crude form, as the crustaceans were used as catalysts, the metals are present as carbonates and hydroxides. Data from the X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1 ) confirmed the predominance of carbonates in the samples, in agreement with the results already reported in the literature (Chakrabarty and Mahapatra, 1999). Mussel presented peaks characteristics of aragonite and crab are mainly constituted by calcite structure, as shown in Fig. 1. Both are different structures of CaCO3, but aragonite is less stable and more soluble than calcite (Gopi et al., 2013)."
9,Liquefaction of the sugarcane bagasse,"3.3 Liquefaction of the sugarcane bagasse The conversion of the sugarcane bagasse into biocrude was performed using a pressurized system with 10 bar N2 , 300 °C for 30 min, and stirring, as previously described. In total 11 experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate, varying the solvent (anhydrous ethanol, hydrous ethanol, and water) and the waste catalysts (10 wt.%) based on CaCO3 (mussel) and chitin/chitosan/CaCO3 (crab), besides pure calcium carbonate. Blank reactions were also performed for each liquection solvent. The experimental conditions and coding were showed in Table 3 . The maximum and the final pressure of each test are also presented in Table 3. After the liquefaction process, both the biocrude and the solid residue (biochar + remaining catalyst) were analyzed, obtaining their yields and higher heating value (HHV). During the bagasse liquefaction reaction, the formation of gas and vapours was observed since the final pressure of the system increased about 2 to 5 bar above the initial pressure (Table 3). It is possible to claim that this pressure originates from the degradation of the bagasse and the formation of non-condensable gases, such as CO, CO2, CH4, and H2 (Brand et al., 2013). Besides these gaseous compounds formed during the reaction, it is known that there were losses of volatile compounds when the excess of solvent was removed during rotary evaporation. During the process, the pressure of the system achieved values above 100 bar (Table 3) in some cases, due to the volatilization of the solvent and the generated products, when the temperature was about 300 °C. As the critical temperature of ethanol is 243 °C and its critical pressure is 63 bar, this alcohol was used as a supercritical fluid. This special fluid has better solvency and permeability, favoring the liquefaction of the bagasse. The critical temperature and critical pressure for water are 374 °C and 218 bar, respectively. So the reactions performed with this solvent operated in subcritical conditions. Fig. 2 shows the conversion of the bagasse into biocrude and gas using different solvents and waste catalyst or without the catalyst. For all three solvents, it is possible to observe that the catalyzed reactions with the wastes shells of mussel (M) or crab (C) showed a greater conversion in comparison to the reactions that were not catalyzed. The reaction with hydrous ethanol (TLh) achieved a higher conversion than those reactions carried out with pure ethanol (TL) or pure water. It seems to be a synergic effect. It is also evident that the catalyzed reactions with the presence of water showed better conversions than the reactions in the alcoholic medium, but the problem was the biocrude recovery as shown in Fig. 3. The results of Table 2 showed that the conversions using CaCO3-pure are the lowest values, equivalent to 66% and 79% for TL-p and TLh-p, respectively, compared to the other processes. This can be attributed to the presence of metallic impurities (as shown in the X-ray fluorescence of the catalysts) and biopolymers in the catalysts based on fishing residues, which promoted greater conversions of sugarcane bagasse. This result showed the importance of the waste catalysts for a more efficient bagasse liquefaction process. For the reactions (Tab. 2) that were catalyzed by CaCO3 from mussel using anhydrous ethanol (TL-M), hydrous ethanol (TLh-M) and pure water (HTL-M), were obtained the following conversions, 75%, 81%, and 83%, respectively. In the processes where waste crab shells were used, the conversions are 76%, 82%, and 95% for TL-C, TLh-C, and HTL-C, respectively. The effect of the crab-based catalyst was more accentuated in water, probably because it is a more complex catalyst, with more metals that may be more active in a medium with water, being possibly more soluble as well. There was also a positive effect of the water present in the hydrous ethanol that showed greater conversions than anhydrous ethanol (Fig. 2). The alkaline catalysts should dissolve the derivatives of cellulose, which are polar compounds as well. And, in this case, CaCO3 forms Ca(OH)2 when water is present, which will solubilize aromatic phenols from lignin which originate biochar. Additionally, these variations in conversion in the presence of different solvents and catalysts can be explained by the differences in the polarity of the solvents in the same conditions. A greater conversion of lignocellulosic biomass is reached with solvents of high polarity, with a dipole moment like water and ethanol equivalent to 1.8 and 1.7 D, respectively, in temperatures lower than 350 °C. This will intensify the hydrolysis reactions of cellulose and hemicellulose (Liu and Zhang, 2008). This fact justifies the greater conversion that was observed for the processes that used pure water as a solvent. Fig. 3 shows the results of the yields in biocrude, biochar, and gas/losses for the reactions performed with anhydrous ethanol (TL), hydrous ethanol (TLh), and water (HTL) without catalysts. The yield of biocrude that was observed for anhydrous and hydrous ethanol did not show a significant difference, even with a low concentration of water present in the alcohol, the yields were equivalent, 59 and 60%, respectively. However, when water was used as a solvent, there was a significant decrease, obtaining a value equivalent to 18%. This occurred due to the difficulty of the biocrude extraction from the aqueous phase, decreasing the yield of the recovered liquid product. A great part of the products stayed dissolved in the aqueous phase and was not accounted for the biocrude content. The same difficulties were reported in the literature using lignocellulosic biomass and hydrothermal route. The authors achieved similar yields of biocrude, about18.9% (Nazari et al., 2015) and 23.0% (Tekin et al., 2012), respectively. Comparing the anhydrous and hydrous ethanol routes, it can be noted that the yield of biochar was lower when hydrous alcohol was applied (18%) than when anhydrous ethanol was used (28%). This probably occurred due to the higher solubility of the catalysts in hydrous ethanol, yielding a more alkaline solution, which promoted the higher solubilization of lignin. Consequently, there was a decrease in biochar content, besides generating a greater amount of lighter products (gas/losses). It is interesting to observe that the data in Table 3 do not show a significant increase in the final pressure of the reactor due to the greater generation of non-condensable gases. Then, it is believed that the losses of the volatile compounds have taken place, during the process of removing the excess of hydrous ethanol using rotary evaporation. These losses can be reduced with changes in the process, as reducing the condenser temperature, improving the biocrude yield in the next studies. The literature corroborates this explanation, as shown by (Pan et al., 2018). These authors state that the increase of water can intensify the hydrolysis and gasification process, generating a greater content of light products that are soluble in water, such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, carbohydrates among others, which can be easily evaporated (Cheng et al., 2010). The yields of biocrude, biochar, and gas/losses from the processes with different waste catalysts and solvents are shown in Fig. 4 . The results (Fig. 4) showed that the use of mussel catalysts (M) was efficient to increase the yield of biocrude when anhydrous ethanol was used (TL-M). The use of crab-shell catalyst increased the yield of biocrude with the use of hydrous ethanol (TLh-C) and there was no significant contribution in experiment HTL-C, in which water was used as a solvent. As already discussed, the low yield of biocrude for the process HTL is attributed to the fact that a part of the biocrude maintained dissolved in the aqueous phase. Regarding the CaCO3-pure catalyst in the presence of anhydrous and hydrous ethanol, the content of biocrude showed intermediate values in comparison to the values for the processes with the waste catalysts. The liquefaction processes with pure calcium carbonate showed high yields of biochar, with values equivalent to 34% and 21%, for TL-p and TLh-p, respectively. These results confirmed that the studied waste catalysts are more efficient for the bagasse liquefaction process than pure CaCO3. Among the alkaline catalysts described in the literature for thermal liquefaction, K2CO3 has been studied frequently in HTL of biomasses, demonstrating suppression of the formation of char, related to the re-polymerization and condensation of fragments, and increases in the yield of biocrude (Nazari et al., 2015), being more effective than KOH. This is due to the reactions of carbonate with water, forming bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions can act as secondary catalysts and promote the formation of biocrude through the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, in smaller parts (Demirbas, 2010). We believe that similar results occurred with calcium carbonate, used in the present study, resulting in a low yield of biochar, especially for the tests performed with hydrous ethanol and water (Fig. 4). The literature shows that, during the liquefaction, the main components will decompose and depolymerize, forming light molecules or fragments. New compounds will form through the rearrangement of these unstable fragments by condensation, cyclization, or polymerization. Some competing reactions occur during the process, such as the cyclization, condensation or polymerization of liquid products, resulting in the formation of a product in a solid phase (biochar), or they are subjected to degradation, releasing gases. The solid product can also be decomposed and the gases can form liquid products (biocrude) (Liu and Zhang, 2008). The use of hydrous ethanol did not increase the yield in biocrude in comparison to anhydrous ethanol (Fig. 4) in the process of bagasse liquefaction. This solvent, however, resulted in a lower yield of biochar, and an enhancement in the light compounds generation, especially when the catalysts of fishing residues were used. Due to the lower cost and the higher availability of hydrous ethanol, it has good potential to be used in the industrial liquefaction process. The use of calcium carbonate catalysts, derived from shells of mussel and crab, also demonstrated to be beneficial, allowing the reuse of these residues with low costs, reducing the environmental impact, and improving the economic feasibility of the biocrude, which can be used as a chemical feedstock or as biofuel. It is important to highlight that the production of biocrude with water involves liquid-liquid extraction to recover it, and then the process becomes overly complicated, especially considering sugarcane bagasse. This biomass is rich in cellulose and hemicellulose, generating products of great polarity and hydrophilicity, with high water solubility. It is believed this route only be justified for the production of molecules with greater value and nobler use, like the cosmetic and pharmaceutic chemicals. Because of these results and the low yield of biocrude HTL (Fig. 3), this procedure will not be used in further steps of this study, which has as a focus to explore biocrude as alternative biofuels. 3.3.1 Physicochemical characterization of the biocrude and biochar The obtained biocrude, after the removal of the solvent excess, are liquid products with dark brown color and typical smoke smell. Table 4 shows the higher heating value, water content, and recovered energy of the biocrudes and biochars synthesized from the catalyzed and non-catalyzed liquefactions, in the presence of anhydrous ethanol or hydrous ethanol. Table 4 also displays the results of the content of Ca in the biocrude samples, to evaluate the catalyst leaching. For a comparative study, the bagasse data are also displayed. Comparing the properties of the biocrudes obtained through non-catalyzed reactions using anhydrous ethanol (TL) and hydrous ethanol (TLh), the water contents were similar (2.2% and 2.6%). However, TLh presented a greater heating value (24.6 MJ.kg−1), about 17% superior concerning TL (21.0 MJ.kg−1), probably due to the lower content of oxygenated molecules. For the catalyzed reactions, the biocrude water content presented lower values (3.0%–6.9%) when anhydrous ethanol was used in regards to the products from hydrous ethanol (11.5%–13.8%), as expected. The humidity was not a determining factor in the heating value, comparing the HHV of TL-C (22.5 MJ.kg−1) and TLh-C (22.9 MJ.kg−1), both with different humidity (6.9% and 13.8%), but with similar HHV. The use of catalysts elevated the HHV of the biocrude, only for the reactions in the presence of anhydrous ethanol. For the reactions with hydrous ethanol, the behavior was different, probably because of the presence of the catalysts in solution. This alkaline medium can generate more oxygenated molecules with a lower heating value, besides high water content in the biocrude. The best result was obtained with the mussel-based catalyst in anhydrous ethanol (23.3 MJ.kg−1), which took an excellent efficiency of the recovered energy (RE), reaching 91%. It is interesting to highlight that all biocrudes presented a higher heating value greater than sugarcane bagasse, which has a value of 18 MJ.kg−1. This result for bagasse is high due to the drying step performed before the reactions. The biocrude HHV values varied between 17% and 37% higher than the bagasse value and the best result (24.6 MJ.kg−1) was obtained for the process with hydrous ethanol without catalyst (TLh). These results can be increased with an optimization of the process, which permits to achieve a higher energy density for the bagasse, besides the gains with the use of the char that has greater functionality than the charcoal obtained by pyrolysis. The results (Table 4) showed that the solid products had lower HHV in the presence of waste catalysts (19.8–22.8 MJ.kg−1) in comparison with the biochars without these minerals in their composition (26.9 MJ.kg−1), as expected. As presented in Table 4, the contents of Ca in the biocrudes are significant, especially for the samples obtained by catalyzed reactions using hydrous ethanol due to water presence. It means that there is leaching of Ca from the catalyst to biocrude samples. This Ca dissolution is more prominent for biocrudes obtained using crab waste catalyst than those with mussel waste or without catalysts. This result was not expected since crab has a lower content of the inorganic phase as shown by thermal analyses data presented by (Cardoso et al., 2019). This catalyst also has calcite as the main crystalline phase as shown by X-ray data (Fig. 1) and this phase is less soluble than aragonite. This behavior can be probably explained by the presence of other impurities in the crab shell (Table 2) which permitted a more intense ionic dissolution. From these results, it is possible to state that it will be necessary to perform a final treatment to remove the mineral impurities, using ion exchange resins, similarly which has been done by the biodiesel industry. 3.3.2 Determination of the biocrude compositions by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry GC/MS The results obtained by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 5 a and b. The GC/MS results showed that the composition of the products is typical of complex mixtures containing phenols, aromatic compounds, carboxylic acids, esters, alcohols, sugars, furans and ethers, anhydrides and ketone in minor quantities. These last three classes were classified as others. The results (Table 5 and Fig. 5) showed the predominant presence of phenolic/aromatic compounds and esters in the products synthesized with and without catalysts, using anhydrous and hydrous ethanol. Furans was also produced when liquefaction was performed with anhydrous ethanol and waste catalyst (mussel and crab). These compounds are not suitable for fuel formulation due to their toxicity and could be isolated to be used as chemicals. 3.3.3 Effect of solvent used in the liquefaction process Comparing the reactions (Fig. 5) carried out without catalysts (TL and TLh), it was observed that a high content of esters (42%) and a low content of alcohol (4%) occurred when anhydrous ethanol was used. For the reaction performed with hydrous ethanol, both alcohol and esters have similar concentrations, 19%, and 17%, respectively. These results indicated the occurrence of esterification of the alcohol during the process, which was favored in the absence of water, especially because esterification is a reversible reaction. The contents of phenolic/aromatic compounds have similar values, equivalent to 39% and 37% for TL and TLh, respectively. 3.3.4 Effect of different waste catalysts in the biocrude composition In the products from catalyzed liquefaction reactions (Fig. 5), performed in anhydrous ethanol, it was observed a decrease of ester content, with an equivalent reduction of 69% for TL-M and a reduction of 71% for TL-C in comparison to the product from the reactions without the catalyst (TL). In the meantime, there was a formation of a considerable quantity of furans, which can indicate the conversion of esters or precursors of esters into furans. The phenolic/aromatic compounds showed a light increasing in their contents when the catalysts were used. The obtained values are 39%, 42%, and 45% for TL, TL-M, and TL-C, respectively. The ester yields for the biocrudes, synthesized with hydrous ethanol and catalysts, showed a great increase from 17% for TLh to 56% and 39% to TLh-M and TLh-C, respectively. It is probably due to the partial dissolution of the catalyst, in the water present in the ethanol, which has favored esterification, by homogeneous catalysis. In this case, there was no formation of furans, confirming the competition between the synthesis of esters and furans. Further investigation must be done to explain the mechanism of these reactions. Table 5 data showed that the main synthesized esters are propanoic acid, 2-hydroxy-, ethyl ester; benzenepropanoic acid 4-hydroxy-, methyl ester, and ethyl-beta-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-propionate, all of them are derivatives of propionic acid. Other esters presented molecules with C12 up to C20 carbons, suitable for fuel production. It is important to highlight that it was not detected compounds with nitrogen in their structures even those samples obtained with crab, which has about 20% of chitin. Again, the content of the phenolic/aromatic compound did not present a significant difference between their results for the catalyzed reactions, with values of 37%, 38%, and 35% for TLh, TLh-M, and TLh-C, respectively. The alcohol contents reduced considerably after the addition of the catalysts, with yields of 19%, 5%, and 6% for TLh, TLh-M, and TLh-C, respectively, due to their consumption in the esterification reactions. The GC/MS data also showed that the esters consisted mainly of ethylic esters that are generated by the esterification of ethanol with carboxylic acids, and so the carboxylic acids are from the bagasse degradation. The main phenolic/aromatic compounds which were obtained are ethyl-phenol, ethyl-methoxyphenol, and 2,6-dimethoxy-phenol (Table 5). They are produced from Cα/Cβ cleavage or Cβ/Cγ reductive cleavage of bonds α-O-4 or β-O-4 present in phenyl propane units of lignin (Cheng et al., 2012) and are also from the aromatization of cellulose and hemicellulose (Lin et al., 2017). These aromatic compounds present groups with alkyl-substituents like -methyl, -ethyl, and -propyl. These results obtained by GC/MS illustrates the influence of the low water content present in the solvent and the interaction of the catalysts based in calcium carbonate. It is known that water in a temperature close to the critical point presents an increase in ionic products, generating more H+ and OH− ions, promoting reactions both in an acidic and basic medium, such as the hydrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (Toor et al., 2011). The content of oxygenated compounds in the biocrude is elevated, which suggests the direct use of these biofuels in the blend formulations, like ethanol in gasoline or biodiesel in diesel, which can contribute to mitigate the greenhouse effect gases and bring other energetic alternatives for the transport sector or for engines out of roads The production of ethylic esters in the catalyzed process is interesting because the esterification can be considered an upgrading reaction, which will reduce the biocrude corrosivity. It is a one-spot process of liquefaction and esterification, using waste feedstock and waste catalysts, yielding biofuels with a potential of industrial application. The production of bio-hydrocarbons from these biocrudes is a challenger upgrading step. The hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions of phenols to synthesize naphthenic compounds can be used for gasoline production. The same reaction, followed by alkylation and oligomerization to increase the chain sizes, can yield molecules in the range of kerosene. As the obtained esters have short chains, it is not interesting to perform their deoxygenation. The best option seems to be to use them in the gasoline or diesel blend formulation as already mentioned."
10,Conclusions,"This study showed that it is possible to produce biocrudes from sugarcane bagasse with high yields using anhydrous (83%) and hydrous (72%) ethanol in a fast process (30 min) at 300 °C and 10 bar of N2. Under these conditions, the solvents are in a supercritical or subcritical state, with special properties. The residual shellfish catalysts (crab and mussel), rich in CaCO3, caused a slight increase in the biocrude yield but, mainly changed the composition of this liquid product. The use of these innovative catalysts led to the formation of a biocrude rich in furans and phenolic compounds, in a process carried out with anhydrous ethanol. When hydrous ethanol was used in the catalyzed reactions, there was mainly the formation of phenolic compounds and ethyl esters, due to the esterification that occurred simultaneously with the bagasse liquefaction, by homogeneous catalysis. The synthesized biocrudes showed HHV in the range of 21–25 MJ.kg−1 and can be used as biofuels for planting, harvesting, grinding, and processing of the sugarcane used as feedstock in the production of ethanol. The biochar produced in the bagasse liquefaction is rich in minerals from crab and mussel residues and can be used in planting sugarcane, reducing fertilizer costs, within the concept of the circular economy. This new kind of biofuel and biochar can be produced using different residues (bagasse, mussel and crab waste) and can make the ethanol and sugar production more sustainable and cleaner."
