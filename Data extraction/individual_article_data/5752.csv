0,Introduction,"Computational tools are increasingly used to complement experimental approaches for metabolic engineering [1–10]. One approach that has emerged recently relies on a computational framework based on graph theory that creates complex networks of reactions and compounds based on generalized enzyme reactions [11–15]. Substrates and products of reactions are represented by matrices, and reactions are carried out through addition of reaction operators. Each enzyme is given a four-digit classification (i. j. k. l) derived based on the Enzyme Commission (EC) database depending on the specific reaction that the enzyme catalyzes. The first number of this classification refers to the main class of the enzyme and identifies its primary function, and the second number refers to the functional group on which the enzyme acts. The third and fourth numbers refer to the cofactors and the substrates associated with the specific enzyme, respectively. The generalized enzyme reaction rule is designed based on the first three levels of enzyme classification. When applied to a starting substrate and its progeny, all possible enzymatic reactions given these generalized enzyme operators are unfurled, including a large number of novel reactions. For a number of different systems, it has been shown that the computational framework identifies hundreds to thousands of novel biochemical pathways from a starting compound to a target compound [14–16]. Various screening methods were applied to cull this large set of novel pathways to a manageable set of attractive candidates, including pathway length, number of novel intermediates, thermodynamic landscape and pathway flux analysis based on metabolic flux analysis and thermodynamic flux analysis [16–19]. To further reduce the set of possible candidates, it would be valuable to assess how easily the novel reactions comprising novel pathways could be engineered in a host organism. A critical piece of this effort is to identify the energetics of the native and novel reactions. A computationally efficient method based on group additivity for estimating free energies of formation in aqueous solution at pH 7 was developed and applied to evaluate the thermodynamic topology of various pathways [16,17,19,20] however, there may some molecules for which groups are not available, or it may be of interest to estimate properties at conditions beyond those for which the group additivity scheme was developed. In these cases, quantum chemical calculations offer an accurate and flexible alternative. Due to the importance of research and development in biofuels, we explored the acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation [21]. First, the known (Scheme 1 ) and novel [20] transformations of pyruvic acid to 1-butanol were studied using quantum chemical methods. Secondly, the energetics of the conversion of a number of keto acids to their corresponding alcohols seen in the Ehrlich pathway [22] for 2-keto acid degradation were assessed (Scheme 2 ). Finally, a detailed investigation of the thermochemistry using high-level quantum chemical methods for the conversion of various 2-keto acids to higher-chain alcohols as predicted by reaction pathways analogous to the ABE pathway for pyruvic acid was performed."
1,Methods,"All calculations were performed at the G3MP2B3 level of theory [23]. Therefore, the zero-point vibrational energy and thermal energies at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory were included. In addition, solvation energies of selected species were calculated using the Conductor like Polarizable Continuum Model [24,25] (CPCM), using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory with UAKS atomic radii in a dichloroethane dielectric medium (ε =10.1), which is representative of a protein environment [26,27]. All quantum chemical calculations were performed using Gaussian 03 [28]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Analysis of reaction network,"3.1 Analysis of reaction network In previous work [20], using six generalized enzyme operators, we reproduced the native butanoate metabolic pathway. The enzyme operators applied for this transformation and the intermediate compounds produced in that reaction network were shown in Fig. 2 of Wu et al. [20]. In addition to the native pathway (Scheme 1), the network generated nine novel pathways. The reaction networks generated using the six enzyme operators and the intermediate compounds created are summarized by Wu et al., and the first seven pathways were reproduced here in Table 1 . All pathways have the same number of steps and the main difference is the order in which the enzyme operators act on particular compounds to effect the overall transformation. In addition to the known compounds from butanoate metabolism, six novel compounds were produced in this network, and four of these were involved in the first seven pathways investigated here and are shown in Scheme 3 . All generated pathways have the same first two steps, i.e., conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (1.2.7) and then to acetoacetyl-CoA (2.3.1). We have performed thermodynamic analysis based on the group contribution method on this network [19]. Since all the pathways have the same overall reaction, they will have the same overall free energy of reaction, and thus, we have focused on the landscape of the free energy surfaces. The first step is exergonic (ΔG =−16.9kcal/mol) and the second is endergonic (ΔG =+7.1kcal/mol) due to the coupling of the two acetyl-CoA molecules for the formation of the carbon–carbon bond. Another important step on the free energy landscape is the step in which 3-hydroxy butanoyl-CoA changes to crotonoyl-CoA by removing a water molecule, by the enzyme operator 4.2.1, where the process is exergonic (ΔG =−16.5kcal/mol). Overall, the potential energy landscape of the native pathway follows the lowest energy pathway compared to the other possibilities [20]."
4,Analysis of the native ABE reaction network using high-level quantum mechanical methods,"3.2 Analysis of the native ABE reaction network using high-level quantum mechanical methods In addition to the thermodynamic analysis based on the group contribution method, we have calculated the reaction energetics using ab initio methods, and the results are presented in Table 2 . We have calculated the change in enthalpy and free energy and the solvation energies of the various reactions in the network. However, for computational simplicity, Coenzyme-A is modeled as ‘CH3-S’. The model complexes employed in the quantum chemical calculations are shown in Scheme 4 . Using the free energies computed for the possible reactions in the network (Table 2) we have evaluated the thermodynamic landscapes for all seven pathways. The free energy landscapes computed using the quantum chemical method are shown in Table 3 . The free energies of reactions calculated using quantum mechanics reproduce the trend along the reaction coordinate that were obtained using the group contribution analysis. For the initial step, ab initio calculations using the model systems predict a similar value (−13.5kcal/mol) compared to the group contribution analysis (−16.9kcal/mol). Note that the model reaction does not include the oxidative decarboxylation and the production of two H+ ions; instead, for simplicity the charge is neutralized by the production of one H2 molecule. Thus, in the energy calculated from quantum mechanics, there is a decrease in the number of particles in the products as well as the lack of proton solvation free energy compared to the group contribution analysis. Despite these differences, the values are in good agreement. Both group contribution analysis and ab initio calculation predicted the second step as an endogonic reaction (+8.4kcal/mol) due to the formation of a carbon–carbon bond. This is consistent with experimental studies that suggest that, in a typical ABE fermentation reaction the coupling between two acetyl-CoA molecules is the rate-limiting process, and excessive amounts of acetyl-CoA have to be used to obtain the C4 product [29]. The free energy reaction barrier, although not explicitly calculated here, would be higher than the free energy of the reaction of 8.4kcal/mol. For the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds, noticeable differences between the quantum chemical calculations and group contribution analysis were observed; especially the free energies of the reactions are more negative for the quantum chemical calculations compared to the group contribution analysis. This is an artifact of the highly exothermic reaction when molecular hydrogen is involved [30]. This could be easily rectified by using the known free energy change for the involvement of NADH, but we present the quantum chemical results based on our choices of the model system here for consistency."
5,Thermochemistry of Ehrlich pathway for native and non-native 2-keto acids,"3.3 Thermochemistry of Ehrlich pathway for native and non-native 2-keto acids The Ehrlich pathway [22,31] (Scheme 2) gained significant importance in the area of biofuel research because of developments in metabolic engineering that enabled the production of energy-rich alcohols from 2-keto acids through decarboxylation and reduction [32,33]. Atsumi et al. devised a synthetic approach to produce higher alcohols in E.coli, where the precursor 2-ketoacids were obtained from amino acid biosynthesis [34]. Here, we have investigated the energetics of the essential chemical transformation by analyzing the decarboxylation and reduction process using high-level quantum mechanical methods. In addition to pyruvic acid, 2-keto-butanoic acid, 2-keto-valeric acid, 2-keto-isovaleric acid, 2-keto-3-methyl-valeric acid, and 2-keto-4-methyl-pentanoic acid were considered. Upon decarboxylation and reduction these 2-keto acids produces alcohol with one less carbon atom. Thus, the final products are ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, isobutanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol respectively. The calculated free energies of the two-step process for the various 2-keto acids are summarized in Table 4 . The calculated free energies show that the overall reaction is exogonic for all the ketoacids (−24 to −26.5kcal/mol), and both 2-keto-isovaleric acid and 2-keto-3methyl-valeric acid have the most negative enthalpies of reaction, which is similar to results previously reported for the decarboxylation of 2-keto acids [35]. However, it is important to note that in order to break the carbon–carbon bond during the decarboxylation process, there would be a barrier that would need to be crossed, the height of which depends on the enzyme, the cofactor and the configuration of the transition state. In our previous studies, we found that thiamine-catalyzed decarboxylation is more facile for linear 2-keto acids than for branched chain keto-acids due to the ease of forming the transition state in enzymes belonging to EC 1.2.7 [26,27]. However, there are enzymes that belong to EC 4.1.1, which also catalyze decarboxylation, where the conversion of branched chain keto acids is preferred. The free energies of reaction for the reduction step for the different keto acids are all quite similar, ranging from −7 to −9kcal/mol. It is evident from these calculations that the energetics of the basic chemical transformation of all the keto acids is very similar."
6,Thermochemistry of reactions in the ABE network for the non-native 2-keto acids,"3.4 Thermochemistry of reactions in the ABE network for the non-native 2-keto acids Given the application of generalized enzyme reaction rules, one can envision that reaction networks can be generated for the other 2-keto acids that are analogous to the ABE metabolic pathway for pyruvic acid. We utilized this concept and investigated the thermochemistry of the various reaction steps in Scheme 1 for 2-keto-butanoic acid, 2-keto-valeric acid and 2-keto-isovaleric acid in addition to the native pyruvic acid. The final products of the routes are 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-pentanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and 2,2-dimethyl-4-methyl-pentanol from pyruvic acid, 2-keto-butanoic acid, 2-keto-valeric acid, 2-keto-isovaleric acid, respectively. The detailed ABE pathways for the non-native keto acids are shown in Schemes S1–S3 in the supporting information. The changes in electronic energy at 0K, enthalpies of reaction at 298K, and free energies of reaction at 298K for all the 2-keto acids studied are tabulated in Table 5 (also shown in Fig. S2 in the supporting information). As was observed for pyruvic acid, all of the reactions in the network are found to be thermodynamically favorable except for the condensation of two CoA moieties to produce the carbon–carbon bond. In the gas phase, our calculations predict the condensation is most endogenic (8.4kcal/mol) for pyruvic acid compared to the non-native keto acids. The major problem for the microbial production of higher alcohols through the ABE route is the slow catalytic rate of the condensation of CoA units [29]. Efficient genetic engineering tools are yet to be developed to condense two bigger CoA units to produce longer alcohols. Another interesting point to note is how the energetics of the initial reduction process differs for aceto-acetyl CoA and its analogues; the free energy of reduction of native substrate, pyruvic acid, is found to be more exogonic compared to that for the non-native keto acids. Subsequent dehydration and reduction processes are found to be exogonic to similar degrees, regardless of the substrates (Table 5). From these calculations, we suggest that the third and fourth reactions are the major differentiating steps for the microbial fermentation of the native and non-native keto acids based on thermodynamics. However, accurate calculations are required to identify the activation energy barriers of the reactions in this network to predict the rate of the chemical transformations of various 2-keto acids."
7,Summary,"Identifying the most promising biochemical reaction pathways consisting of both known and novel reactions to synthesize carbon-based compounds requires a molecular-level understanding of the reactions comprising them. We have shown the ability of high-level quantum chemical methods to predict the thermochemistry of various chemical transformations involving pyruvic acid and 2-keto acids in aqueous solution. Although the calculations presented in this paper are at a very high level of theory, the effect of the enzyme is taken into account through a continuum description of the enzyme as a dielectric. However, specific enzyme–substrate interactions govern the catalysis, and thus more detailed description of the enzyme is required to predict the activation barriers."
