0,Introduction,"Semiconductor heterogeneous photocatalysis organic synthesis is a green and sustainable approach that has attracted extensive attention due tothe advantages of enabling organic conversion synthesis under mild conditions and the catalysts that can be easily separated and recovered [1–6]. In recent decades, many efforts have been made to explore various photocatalysts for achieving efficient organic transformation [7–13]. However, it still suffers from the low separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and lacks a clear mechanism to explain surface/interface interactions between organic molecules and a photocatalyst [14,15]. Thus, it is a great challenge to design a suitable photocatalyst which not only significantly improves the photocatalytic performance, but also provides a suitable platform to study the surface/interface interactions between the surface active sites of a photocatalyst and organic molecules. Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials are a class of lamellar nanomaterials with a high transverse size and thickness ratio [16,17]. Because of their large specific surface area, rapid transfer of charge from the interior to the surface, abundant surface active sites and other unique physical and chemical properties, they have triggered extensive research interest [18–22]. In our previous studies, a series of ultrathin nanosheets such as HNb3O8 [23], ZnTi-LDH [24], Pt/Sb2WO6 [25], Au-Pd/SnNb2O6 [26] and Pd/ H1.07Ti1.73O4·H2O [27,28] were fabricated and applied to photocatalytic organic transformations. The ultrathin nanosheet structure of the photocatalysts greatly improves the photocatalytic performance. Moreover, these studies also reveal that ultrathin 2D materials are excellent platforms to disclose the surface/interface interactions between organic reactive molecules and the surface active sites from a molecular level perspective. Recently, many types of bismuth-based photocatalysts are notable for their special layered structures which are facilitated for the preparation of 2D ultrathin nanosheets [29–32]. Bismuth-based materials such as Bi2WO6 [33], Bi2MoO6 [34], BiOCl [35] and BiOBr [36] have been prepared as ultrathin nanosheets for photocatalytic organic synthesis and obtained promising progress. Besides, Bi4Ti3O12 is a good optical, ferroelectric and optoelectronic material as one of the important components of the Aurivillius phase family [37]. It has been reported that Bi4Ti3O12 could be used as a photocatalyst for hydrogen production [38], CO2 reduction [39], and pollutant degradation [40]. However, these reports make little mention of the surface/interface relationship between the reacting molecules and the catalyst, while extending the application of Bi4Ti3O12 in the field of photocatalytic organic synthesis is also necessary. As far as we know, Bi4Ti3O12 has a layered sandwich structure which is constituted by alternating (Bi2O2)2+ layers and (Bi2Ti3O10)2- pseudo-perovskite layers along the crystallographic c-axis [41]. This structure facilitates the fabrication of ultrathin nanosheets to accelerate photogenerated carrier transfer and exposes more surface Ti atoms to serve as active sites for the adsorption and activation of organic molecules [28]. In addition, as previously stated, 2D ultrathin nanosheets with monolayer or several atom layers thickness are the ideal platform to study the interactions between a photocatalyst and organic molecules for understanding photocatalytic mechanism at a molecular level. Therefore, it is worth tuning the thickness of Bi4Ti3O12 to an ultrathin atomic scale to achieve a high photocatalytic performance and reveal the relationship between the surface active sites and the reacting organic molecules at a molecular level. Herein, ultrathin Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets (NS) with the monolayer thickness are successfully fabricated by a hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) is used as a model reaction to study the surface/interface interactions between the surface active sites of a photocatalyst and the organic molecules. NS was characterized by SEM, TEM and AFM to investigate its unique ultrathin 2D structure. The photogenerated carrier separation and transfer ability of NS were studied by PC, EIS and PL. Moreover, the exposed sites on the surface of NS and the interactions between these sites and BA molecules were revealed by in-situ FTIR, XPS and UV–vis DRS. The active species in the photocatalytic system were probed by EPR. Finally, a comprehensive photocatalytic mechanism for the oxidation of BA over NS was revealed at a molecular level."

3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Ultrathin Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets (as marked NS) were prepared using hydrothermal method. Firstly, 2 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 1.5 mmol of Ti(OC4H9)4 were dissolved into 20 mL 10% HNO3, 0.74 g of P123 was dissolved into 15 mL of ethanol. Then, the two solutions were mixed and the pH value of the resulting solution was adjusted to 7 with NaOH solution (2 M), forming the white suspension. Finally, the suspension was transferred into a 100 mL of Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 48 h. After the reaction, the precipitate was collected by centrifuging, washed alternately with deionized water and ethanol for several times, and dried at 60 °C for 10 h. For comparison, bulk Bi4Ti3O12 (as marked Bulk) was prepared by using classical solid-state reaction [42]. 10 mmol of Bi2O3 and 15 mmol of TiO2 were mixed and ground for 1 h. Then the mixture was heated at 800 °C for 2 h in the air. The final product was crushed and collected."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffractometer (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with monochromatized Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken by a FEI Quanta 200F electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), higher-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were acquired on a JEOL model JEM2010 EX microscope operated at 200 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were carried out on a Nanoscope E multimode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were taken on an ESCALAB 250Xi XPS system with Al-Kα radiation and binding energies were calibrated by use of contaminant carbon (C 1 s at 284.8 eV) as reference. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were measured using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cary 500). Nitrogen (N2) adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on Micrometric ASAP 2020 M.

Thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) was carried out on a STA449F5 simultaneous thermal analyzer. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker A300 spectrometer."
5,In-situ Fourier transform infrared measurement,"2.4 In-situ Fourier transform infrared measurement A Nicolet iS50 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer was used to acquire the in-situ FTIR spectra of pyridine and BA absorbed on Bi4Ti3O12 samples. Each spectrum was obtained by scanning a total of 64 times at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Firstly, 20 mg of the sample was pressed into a thin IR disk. Then the disk was fixed to a sample holder which could be slid along the inner wall of a quartz tube. Before initiating the first FTIR measurement, the disk in the tube was treated under dynamic vacuum (7 × 10-2 hPa) at 200 °C for 2 h to remove surface contaminants. After the tube cooling to room temperature, 15 μL of BA or pyridine was spiked onto the disk with a syringe via the plug. 30 min later, adsorption equilibrium was reached and then the second FTIR spectrum was collected. The physisorption of BA or pyridine was removed by further evacuation at 150 °C for 3 min under 7 × 10-2 hPa, and then another FTIR spectrum was collected."
6,Electrochemistry measurement,"2.5 Electrochemistry measurement Mott-Schottky, photocurrent (PC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were conducted on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation in a standard three electrode system with Pt, Ag/AgCl and working electrodes. Working electrode was fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. 5 mg of a sample dispersed in 0.5 mL of a mixture with deionized water, ethanol (VH 2 O : VEtOH = 3 : 2) and 5 μL of Nafion solution (0.5 wt%) by ultrasonic. Then the 50 μL of suspension was dropped onto an area of 0.196 cm2 at one end of the FTO plate and covered with nail polish except for the circular area and the other end. 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 6.8) was used as the electrolyte in the Mott-Schottky and photocurrent measurements. A mixture of K3[Fe(CN)6] (0.1 M), K4Fe[(CN)6] (0.1 M) and KCl (0.1 M) for the electrochemical impedance testing."
7,Photocatalytic measurement,"2.6 Photocatalytic measurement The catalyst (10 mg) was suspended in benzotrifluoride (2 mL) containing BA (0.1 mmol) in a 10 mL Schlenk reaction tube. After the suspension was bubbled with O2 for 5 min, the tube was sealed with an oxygen filled balloon. Subsequently, the suspension was magnetically stirred for 30 min in the dark to establish equilibrium between adsorption and desorption. After illumination under a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300D, Beijing Perfectlight) with a 360 nm cutoff filter for a certain time, the suspension was collected and filtered through a nylon syringe filter to remove the catalyst. The filtrate was analyzed by a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph (GC-2014C). The conversion of BA and the selectivity of BAD were calculated as follows: C o n v e r s i o n % = C 0 - C BA / C 0 × 100 % S e l e c t i v i t y % = C BAD / C 0 - C BA × 100 % The initial concentration of BA is denoted as C0. The detected concentrations of BA and BAD are denoted as CBA and CBAD, respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Composition and morphology characterization,"3.1 Composition and morphology characterization Fig. 1 a shows the XRD patterns of the prepared samples. All the diffraction peaks of the samples can be well indexed to the standard orthorhombic Bi4Ti3O12 (JCPDS#73–2181; Space group: Fmmm; Lattice parameters: a = 5.410 Å, b = 5.448 Å, c = 32.840 Å), suggesting that the pure phase Bi4Ti3O12 samples were synthesized successfully. The structure of Bi4Ti3O12 is alternately composed of (Bi2O2)2+ layers and (Bi2Ti3O10)2- layers as shown in Fig. 1b. In addition, compared with Bulk, the diffraction peaks of NS are wider, which implies that NS may be nanocrystallization. The morphology of the prepared samples was characterized by SEM, TEM and AFM. SEM images (Fig. 2 a and b) show the different morphologies between NS and Bulk, i.e. irregular small flakes and large laminated blocks, respectively. Furthermore, the TEM image (Fig. 3 a) shows a certain stack of transparent sheets implying an ultrathin structure. Clear lattice stripes are shown in HRTEM image (Fig. 3b), and the interplanar distance of 0.272 nm and 0.271 nm corresponds to the (200) plane and (020) plane, respectively, indicating that the nanosheets expose the {001} facets [43]. SAED (Fig. 3c) displays a regular array of dots indicating that the prepared NS is single crystal. Meanwhile, the estimated ratio of Bi, Ti and O elements shown in the EDS spectrum of NS is close to 4:3:12 (Fig. S1), which is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of pure Bi4Ti3O12. Moreover, AFM images (Fig. 3d-f) and phase image (Fig. S2) demonstrate that the average thickness of the nanosheets is 3.9 nm, which combined with the lattice parameter c indicates that the nanosheets are monolayer. Integrated with the above results, it can be concluded that the monolayer Bi3Ti4O12 nanosheets were synthesized successfully. The difference in morphology may have an important effect on specific surface area. As depicted in Fig. S3, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms maybe assigned to type II curve according to the IUPAC classification, implying the absence of pores in the prepared samples [44]. The specific surface areas of NS and Bulk are calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, which are 18.28 m2/g and 0.98 m2/g, respectively. The specific surface area of NS is 18 times higher than that of Bulk because NS has overcome the steric inhibition of adjacent layers. The improved specific surface area of NS would provide more active sites for the oxidation of BA. XPS was used to investigate the surface composition and the element chemical state of the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the survey XPS spectra reveal that prepared samples are mainly composed of Bi, Ti and O. For NS, the peaks at 159.1 eV and 164.4 eV in the high-resolution Bi 4f spectra (Fig. 4b) are ascribed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, which is the characteristic of Bi3+ [45]. In Fig. 4c, the peak at 458.1 eV is ascribed to Ti 2p3/2 and here a broad peak is caused by the partial overlap of Ti 2p1/2 peak (463.7 eV) and Bi 4d3/2 peak (466.0 eV) [46]. The binding energy positions of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 indicate that Ti presents Ti4+ in NS. It has been reported that Ti4+ usually can be used as Lewis acid sites for the adsorption of alcohol molecules [24]. For Bulk, the binding energies of Bi and Ti show a slight shift to higher binding energy, suggesting that the electron densities of Bi and Ti in NS are higher. This phenomenon may be assigned to the partial reduction of Bi and Ti by ethanol during the hydrothermal process and the surface charge rearrangement in NS. Moreover, in Fig. 4d, the O 1 s high-resolution XPS peaks of both samples are fitted with three peaks, which can be ascribed to lattice oxygen (O1), hydroxyl (O2) and adsorbed oxygen (O3), respectively [47]. The estimated atom proportion of O2 (25.9%) in NS is higher than that in Bulk (22.8%) (Table S1). This suggests that NS has more surface hydroxyl groups which would facilitate the adsorption and activation of BA [48]."
10,Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.2 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol The photocatalytic performances of the prepared samples were assessed by the oxidation of BA to BAD under light irradiation (λ ≥ 360 nm, Fig. S4) at 298 K with oxygen atmosphere using BTF as the solvent. As prolonging the irradiation time, the conversion of BA over NS is increased and the high selectivity of BAD is maintained (Fig. S5). After irradiation for 5 h, the conversion of BA (35.5%) with the high BAD selectivity (99.8%) is achieved over NS (Table 1 , entry 1), which is about 8 times higher than that of Bulk (Table 1, entry 2). And NS also exhibits a favorable performance in comparison with the other previously reported pristine catalysts (Table S2, entries 2–4), except for some composite catalysts (Table S2, entries 5–7). The prepared NS was used for oxidation of other aromatic alcohols. It is found that aromatic alcohols containing electron-donating groups (such as –OCH3 and –CH3; Table S3, entries 1–2) are more easily oxidized than those containing electron-withdrawing groups (such as -Cl and -F; Table S3, entries 3–4). The possible reason is that the electron-donating groups can increase the electron density of –CH2OH groups to facilitate the activation and deprotonation of –CH2OH groups by photogenerated h+ to form the corresponding carbon-centered radicals [49]. The BA conversion of NS is decreased to 23.6% in an atmosphere of air and is lower under the nitrogen or argon atmosphere (Table 1, entries 3–5), meaning that O2 molecules play an important role in the oxidation of BA. And there is still a certain conversion of BA in the absence of O2, indicating that the participation of photogenerated h+ in the reaction. Moreover, no BAD is detected without a photocatalyst, in the absence of light or at 378 K in the dark (Table 1, entries 6–8), respectively, implying that the oxidation of BA is driven by light. Additionally, the stability of NS was assessed via a five-time recycle test (Fig. S6). After five times recycle, the conversion of BA and the selectivity of BAD over NS do not decrease significantly. Furthermore, there are no significant changes in XRD patterns (Fig. S7), SEM (Fig. S8a) and TEM images (Fig. S8b) of NS before and after five times photocatalytic recycle, indicating that the morphology and crystalline phase of NS are not disrupted. Therefore, NS is very stable in the photocatalytic BA oxidation process."
11,Reasons for enhanced photocatalytic activity,"3.3 Reasons for enhanced photocatalytic activity Photogenerated electrons (e-)-holes (h+) separation efficiency and transfer capability are important factors for the photocatalytic reaction, and here we have adopted electrochemical tests to assess these properties of the prepared photocatalysts. The PC spectra were recorded with interval 20 s light on and off cycle as shown in Fig. 5 a, NS exhibits nearly twice higher the photocurrent density than Bulk, indicating that more efficient separation of photogenerated e--h+ pairs in NS. EIS provides evidence for better transfer photoinduced carrier capability of NS. NS has a smaller radius of the Nernst circle than Bulk (Fig. 5b), meaning that NS has less resistance to charge transfer. To further determine the recombination of photogenerated carriers in the photocatalysts, PL spectra were measured. For NS sample, the emission signal intensity of the PL is weaker than that of Bulk counterpart (Fig. 5c), implying that the photogenerated carriers in NS are less likely to recombine, i.e. higher charge separation efficiency. Therefore, the better photogene rated carrier separation and transfer capability of NS can be one of reasons for enhanced photocatalytic activity. The active sites on the catalyst surface are also an important factor in the photocatalytic activity. Acid sites on the surface of photocatalysts have been reported to facilitate the oxidation of BA [23,50]. Therefore, we examined the total acidity and the type of acid sites of the prepared photocatalysts by NH3-TPD and pyridine adsorption in-situ FTIR experiments, respectively. The appearance of signal peaks in NH3-TPD experiments (Fig. S9 and Fig. S10) proves the presence of acid sites on the catalyst surface. And the total area of the NH3 desorption peaks for NS is larger than that of Bulk, indicating that NS possesses more acid sites [51]. In the pyridine adsorption in-situ FTIR spectrum of NS (Fig. 6 a), there are two strong peaks at 1443 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1, indicating that the pyridine molecules are adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites [52]. These sites are Ti4+ atoms located on (001) facets of NS [53]. After the evacuation treatment, the intensity of the characteristic peaks of the remaining chemisorbed pyridine is significantly stronger than that of the sample Bulk (Fig. 6b), suggesting that NS contains more surface Lewis acid sites (Ti4+). These exposed surface Lewis acid sites (Ti4+) would act as active sites to enhance the surface/interface interactions between NS and the BA molecules greatly facilitating the photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, NS containing more Lewis acid active sites (Ti4+) exhibits the higher photocatalytic performance for the BA oxidation. Furthermore, the surface/interface interactions between the photocatalysts and the BA molecules have been explored by in-situ FTIR and XPS. As shown in Fig. 6c, after the BA molecules are physically and chemically adsorbed on NS surface, four groups of peaks (1495 cm−1, 1452 cm−1, 1206 cm−1 and 1080 cm−1) appear in the spectrum, corresponding to the CC stretching vibration, the CH2 scissor bending vibration, the CH in-plane bending vibration and the CO stretching vibration peaks of BA, respectively [50,54]. After degassing, these peaks still remain indicating that BA molecules can be well chemisorbed on NS surface. However, the intensity of these peaks is weak for Bulk, indicating that NS with Lewis acid sites (Ti4+) have stronger chemical adsorption for BA molecules. Moreover, the binding energy changes of Bi and Ti elements in NS were studied by the XPS spectra of NS before and after BA adsorption. As shown in Fig. S11, after the adsorption of BA, the binding energy of Bi has no change, while the binding energy of Ti shifts by 0.1 eV in the direction of low binding energy, which indicates that the BA molecules would interact with the Ti sites on NS surface rather than the Bi sites. The BA molecules can be activated by forming a CO⋯Ti coordination between the CO groups and the exposed Lewis acid sites Ti4+ [28]. In addition, the interactions between the photocatalysts and BA molecules were further revealed by UV–vis DRS. As shown in Fig. S12, the spectrum of NS is red-shifted and the absorption range is extended after BA adsorption while no visible change is observed in the spectrum of Bulk counterpart before and after BA adsorption, further confirming the strong surface/interface interactions between NS and BA molecules. All the above results suggest that the BA molecules would be adsorbed and activated on the surface Lewis acid sites (Ti4+) of NS via forming a CO⋯Ti coordination. Therefore, the photocatalytic performance of BA oxidation is greatly improved due to the surface/interface interactions between NS and the BA molecules."
12,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Photocatalytic mechanism The well-defined energy band structure of photocatalysts allows us to study the mechanism of photogenerated e- and h+ transfer. Firstly, the optical absorption properties of the catalysts were characterized by UV–vis DRS. Compared with Bulk, NS exhibits a blue shift in the optical absorption band edge (Fig. S13a) due to its quantum size effect. And the optical band gaps (Eg) of NS and Bulk are 3.23 eV and 3.09 eV (Fig. S13b), respectively, calculated from the (F(R)hν)1/2 versus hν curves (Bi4Ti3O12 is an indirect band gap semiconductor) [55]. Then the flat band potentials (Efb) of photocatalysts were determined by Mott-Schottky test. As shown in Fig. S14, the positive slopes of the tangents to the curves imply that the semiconductors are n-type. The tangent intercepts correspond to the Efb, which are −0.47 V and −0.48 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for NS and Bulk, respectively. Accordingly, the obtained potentials are converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH = 0) of −0.27 V and −0.28 V, respectively [56]. Since the conduction band minimum (CBM) positions of n-type semiconductors are usually considered to be negative 0.1 V compared to their Efb [57], the CBM positions of NS and Bulk are calculated to be −0.37 V and −0.38 V (vs. NHE), respectively. It suggests that the photogenerated e- of both reduce O2 to ·O2 – (-0.33 V vs. NHE) in accordance with the thermodynamic conditions [58]. The valence band maxima (VBM) values of NS and Bulk are determined to be 2.86 V and 2.71 V (vs. NHE), respectively, according to the equation EVBM = Eg + ECBM. That means the VBM values of both are more than the redox potential of BA oxidation (+1.98 V vs. NHE), and the photogenerated h+ of both can oxidize BA (Fig. 7 a) [59]. Further, the active radicals in the photocatalytic reaction were investigated using in-situ EPR tests with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the radical trapping agent. As shown in Fig. 7b, neither NS nor Bulk produces a signal for EPR during dark conditions, while both produce a mixed signal for superoxide radicals (quartet peaks •) and carbon-centered radicals (sextet peaks ◊) during light conditions [60]. When the samples are illuminated, the photogenerated e- reduce O2 molecules to produce superoxide radicals and the photogenerated h+ deprotonate BA to produce carbon-centered radicals. The signal intensity of NS is stronger than that of Bulk. This indicates that unique ultrathin nanosheet structure of NS would greatly promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, and the larger specific surface area and more exposed active sites of NS would facilitate the better adsorption and activation of BA molecules. Meanwhile, the stronger signal intensity of NS also means that NS can produce more reactive radicals involved in the reaction under light to achieve a higher conversion of BA to BAD. This result is consistent with the result of activity comparison experiment that NS presents better activity than Bulk counterpart. Based on the analysis of the above experimental results, a molecularly based reaction mechanism is proposed to elucidate the photocatalytic oxidation of BA to BAD over NS (Fig. 8 ). Firstly, BA molecules are absorbed and activated on Lewis acid sites (Ti4+) exposed to the surface of NS. Then under the light irradiation, the generated photogenerated e- would reduce the adsorbed O2 to ·O2 –, while the generated photogenerated h+ further activate the adsorbed BA molecules and deprotonate them to form carbon-centered radicals. Finally, the ·O2 – induce the –OH deprotonation of carbon-centered radicals to form BAD and H2O2 which can be detected by iodometric method (Fig. S15) [61], while the formed H2O2 can also turn into H2O through a series of transformations in the reaction. The efficient separation ability of photogenerated carriers and rich surface Lewis acid sites (Ti4+) of NS synergistically achieve a high performance for the photocatalytic oxidation of BA."
13,Conclusions,"In conclusion, ultrathin Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets (NS) with the monolayer thickness were successfully synthesized for the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD). The NS exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance compared with the bulk counterpart and is also superior to the previously reported pristine catalysts [62–64]. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the nanosheets rises from two contributions: (i) the ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) structure facilitates the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons (e–)-holes (h+) pairs. (ii) the abundant Lewis acid sites (Ti4+) exposed on the surface can adsorb and activate more BA molecules by forming CO⋯Ti coordination. Moreover, it is revealed that the superoxide radicals and carbon-centered radicals are the active species in the course of photocatalytic reaction. This work successfully uses the monolayer Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with rich surface Lewis acid sites (Ti4+) as molecular platforms to deeply study the surface/interface interactions between the Ti4+ sites and BA molecules, and also provides an in-depth understanding for the intrinsic mechanism of photocatalysis at the molecular level."
