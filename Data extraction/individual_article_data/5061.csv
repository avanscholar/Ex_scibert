0,Introduction,"Alloying is an effective method for modifying the catalytic activity of metal species for various chemical transformations [1]. During the course of our investigations on palladium-based catalysts, we demonstrated that the alloying of Pd with Zn as well as with In or Ga significantly modifies its catalytic functions for steam reforming and dehydrogenation of methanol. In contrast to monometallic Pd catalysts with which only decomposition of methanol occurs, these alloyed Pd catalysts show markedly improved activities, selectively forming CO2 and H2 for the reforming [2,3] and HCOOCH3 and H2 for the dehydrogenation [3,4]. In addition, the alloyed Pd catalysts are also active for selective hydrogenation of acetonitrile to ethylamine [5]. Those results show the alloyed Pd catalysts to be effective for chemical modification of such functional groups as CO and CN, but not for decomposition of these groups. The present work has then been undertaken to study the catalytic behavior of these palladium-based alloys for selective hydrogenation of a carbonyl group of a conjugated substrate of crotonaldehyde. Selective hydrogenations of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and of other substrates are of importance from scientific and practical points of view, so the control of product selectivity is a challenging task [6,7]. A comprehensive review of Gallezot and Richard discusses different factors affecting the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols with various metal catalysts [7]. The transition metals such as Ni, Co, Pt and Rh hydrogenate both CC and CO double bonds, giving saturated alcohols. To achieve high selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols, choosing an efficient support, adding promoters and using bimetallic catalysts have been investigated [7,8]. By contrast, palladium is not a good catalyst for the selective production of unsaturated alcohols, since it selectively catalyzes the hydrogenation of CC bond, giving saturated aldehydes [8]. Sarkany et al. reported that the activity of hydrogenation of CC bond with Pd catalysts was significantly modified by using bimetallic catalysts, e.g., Pd–Zn, Pd–Cu, Pd–Co [9]. Such modification was also observed in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde with Pt/ZnO catalysts [10]. Butyraldehyde was selectively formed by the hydrogenation of CC bond of crotonaldehyde on monometallic Pt, while crotyl alcohol was selectively formed on Pt–Zn bimetallic catalysts prepared by reduction of Pt/ZnO. It was proposed that modification of the electronic properties of Pt by alloying with Zn changes the adsorption mode of crotonaldehyde. Based upon the literature, it can be expected that Pd–Zn alloy catalysts will show high selectivity for the formation of unsaturated alcohols in the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde hydrogenation. In this study, hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde has been carried out over palladium-based catalysts. It has been shown that alloying of Pd with Zn results in a significant enhancement in its activity for hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. The effects of alloying and reaction conditions and alloy crystallite size on the overall activity and the product distribution have been examined in detail. A brief work was previously published about the use of Pd/ZnO for liquid phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde [11]."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample preparation and characterization,"2.1 Sample preparation and characterization Catalyst samples were prepared by methods similar to those previously used [3,5]. Six kinds of support materials were used: ZrO2, CeO2, MgO, SiO2 (source: GL Sciences, purity from supplier: 99.0%), Al2O3 (Nishio Industry, 99.7%) and ZnO (Kanto Chemical, 99.0%). The former three materials were prepared after the calcination of ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O, Ce2(CO3)3·nH2O, and Mg(OH)2, respectively, in air at 500°C for 3h, the others were used as received. These materials, purchased from several suppliers, were all of reagent grade. The BET surface areas of the supports used were 620m2 g−1 (SiO2), 148m2 g−1 (Al2O3), 126m2 g−1 (MgO), 73m2 g−1 (ZrO2), 45m2 g−1 (CeO2), and 4m2 g−1 (ZnO). Supported Pd catalysts were prepared by immersing the supports in a solution of Pd(NO3)2 in nitric acid and evaporating the solvent at 70°C under reduced pressure. This solution was a strongly acidic solution of pH <1, it was stable under ambient conditions. In the case of ZnO, it was almost soluble in this solution and so the catalyst preparation was a type of coprecipitation. The other support materials were much less soluble in that solution and so the catalyst preparation was a type of impregnation. The Pd-loaded samples so obtained were dried at 110°C overnight and then calcined in air at 500°C for 3h. These samples were reduced before hydrogenation runs as described below. The nominal Pd loading was 10wt.% (the weight of metallic Pd to the total weight of catalyst) in most cases, but it was changed between 1wt.% and 10wt.% in some cases. The catalysts prepared were characterized by X-ray diffraction (JEOL JDX-8020) using Cu Kα radiation. The average size of PdZn alloy crystallites was estimated from XRD line broadening with the Debye–Scherrer equation. The amounts of H2 chemisorbed on Pd/ZnO catalysts were measured by means of a Quantachrom AUTOSORB system, following the double isotherm method. Prior to sorption measurements, the catalyst sample was reduced in a H2 stream at a given temperature ranging from 220°C to 500°C and evacuated at the same temperature. Then a first isotherm was measured at 100°C. Subsequently, the sample was evacuated for 1h at the same temperature and a second isotherm was obtained. From the difference between the first and second isotherms extrapolated to zero pressure, the amount of strongly chemisorbed H2 was determined. The catalysts were also examined with scanning electron microscopy/X-ray microanalysis (JEOL JSM-6500F, JED-2200F). The catalyst sample was mounted on an aluminum holder using electro-conductive carbon tape."
3,Hydrogenation activity measurement,"2.2 Hydrogenation activity measurement Gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was carried out with a glass fixed bed flow-type reactor, which was heated by an electric furnace, the temperature was measured by a thermocouple attached at the outside of reactor [5]. A weighed catalyst was pretreated in the reactor by passing O2/He (20/80) at a total flow rate of 100cm3/min at 500°C for 2h and then cooling to room temperature. Next, the sample was reduced with H2/He (4/96) at room temperature for 1h and at increasing temperatures at 5K/min up to 500°C at a total flow rate of 100cm3/min. After the reduction, a pure He stream was introduced and the sample was cooled to a reaction temperature of 200°C. The hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was started by introducing a crotonaldehyde/H2 (1.1/100.2) mixture, which was prepared by passing H2 through a reservoir of crotonaldehyde cooled by ice water. In some cases, H2 partial pressure was changed by dilution with He. The effluent gases were analyzed by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. The total conversion was determined from the amounts of crotonaldehyde (UAL) before and after reaction. Under the conditions used, crotyl alcohol (UOL), butyraldehyde (SAL) and n-butyl alcohol (SOL) were formed along with carbon monoxide, propane, propyrene, and dibutyl ether (DBE). The selectivity to these products was determined on the carbon basis as follows: selectivity=(outlet partial pressure of a product) × factor/(inlet partial pressure of UAL − outlet partial pressure of UAL); factor=1 for UOL, SAL and SOL, 1/4 for CO, 3/4 for C3H8 and C3H6, 2 for DBE. The details of hydrogenation conditions will be presented at appropriate places in the following sections."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Effects of support materials and alloying,"3.1 Effects of support materials and alloying Typical changes in the total conversion and the quantity of products with time on stream at 200°C are presented in Fig. 1 . With Pd/ZnO, Pd/SiO2, and the other Pd catalysts prepared, the conversion decreased and the product distribution changed with time at an early stage of reaction, but not so much at longer times. A similar decrease in the activity was previously observed with supported Pt catalysts at reaction temperatures of around 80°C [12]. Here, the results obtained after 185min will be used to characterize and compare the supported Pd catalysts. Table 1 shows the results for the Pd catalysts using different support materials, including the state of palladium, which was determined by XRD. Fig. 2 gives the XRD patterns collected after the reaction. These were the same as before the reaction [3] and so the bulk structure of palladium did not change by the reaction at 200°C. On the reduction at 500°C, PdZn alloy was formed for Pd/ZnO, but no alloys were formed for the others, which included metallic Pd. Table 1 indicates that the catalysts except for Pd/ZnO give almost complete conversion and different patterns of the product distribution compared with the Pd/ZnO catalyst. Little UOL is produced with these catalysts; in contrast, the Pd/ZnO catalyst is less active but it produces a larger quantity of UOL in a selectivity of 45% in addition to SAL and SOL, no other products are formed. Fig. 3 gives the selectivity–conversion relationship for three selected catalysts of Pd/ZnO, Pd/Al2O3, and Pd/SiO2. The product selectivity does not depend on the conversion so markedly for the latter two catalysts. This is also the case for the former catalyst at small conversion levels. Above a conversion of about 50%, however, the selectivity to either UOL or SAL decreases, while that to the fully hydrogenated product of SOL increases. Thus, the catalytic features of Pd/ZnO are significantly different than those of the other Pd catalysts irrespective of the conversion levels. For the Pd catalysts other than Pd/ZnO, C3 hydrocarbons (mainly propane along with a very small quantity of propylene) and CO were also formed. The quantities of C3 and CO were almost the same. In these catalysts, Pd is in the metallic state. It is known that decarbonylation of acetaldehyde can occur on the metallic Pd, giving CO and CH4, while such a decarbonylation is suppressed on PdZn alloy [4b]. The formation of CO and C3 observed is a result of the decarbonylation of UAL and/or SAL. With Pd/SiO2, a large quantity of dibutyl ether was formed, probably due to the condensation of SOL. The present results demonstrate that the selectivity to UOL is significantly enhanced on alloying Pd with Zn. This enhancement corresponds with a trend derived from previous results of other alloy catalysts: that the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol of a metal is improved when it is alloyed with another more electropositive metal [7]; in the present alloy of Pd with Zn, the Pauling's electronegativity values are 2.2 and 1.6 for Pd and Zn, respectively [13]. The influence of H2 partial pressure was examined using Pd/ZnO, Pd/Al2O3, and Pd/SiO2 catalysts. Fig. 4 shows that the overall conversion increases with H2 pressure up to 100kPa for Pd/ZnO while it increases similarly up to 10kPa. It does not change so much at higher pressures for the other two catalysts. The product selectivity is also given in Fig. 4, indicating a significant difference between Pd/ZnO and the other two catalysts. For Pd/ZnO, no products were detected in the absence of H2. At pressures below 30kPa, SAL is produced more selectively than UOL, but these two are formed in a very similar quantities at higher pressures. The fully hydrogenated product, SOL, is formed in very small quantity at pressures examined. It was observed, in contrast, for Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 that propylene and CO were formed in the absence of H2 and that the quantities of these products decreased with time on stream; this decrease occurred more quickly on Pd/Al2O3 than Pd/SiO2. When H2 was introduced, this decarbonylation was suppressed and SAL was formed in more than 80% selectivity at H2 pressures up to 100kPa. Those results demonstrate that the PdZn alloy catalyst (Pd/ZnO) is significantly different from the other monometallic Pd catalysts in the performance for UAL hydrogenation. The PdZn catalyst has merits that the UOL selectivity is high and SOL selectivity is low under certain conditions. Next, the influence of preparation conditions on the activity of Pd/ZnO has been examined."
6,Effects of preparation conditions for Pd/ZnO,"3.2 Effects of preparation conditions for Pd/ZnO Table 2 shows the results of Pd/ZnO samples reduced at different temperatures and Fig. 5 gives their XRD patterns. The samples reduced at 220°C and 300°C are more active and more selective to SOL compared with the other two samples reduced at higher temperatures. The latter two samples are also different in that the sample reduced at 400°C produces SAL in about 80% selectivity, while similar quantities of SAL and UOL are obtained with the sample reduced at 500°C. The reduction temperature significantly affects the formation of PdZn alloy, as shown in Fig. 5. The Pd/ZnO sample changes from the catalytic features characteristic of monometallic Pd catalyst to those of alloyed PdZn catalyst with the reduction temperature. The influence of the amount of Pd loaded has been examined at a fixed reduction temperature of 500°C, which is sufficient for the formation of PdZn alloy. Fig. 6 indicates that the overall conversion slightly decreases with the Pd loading; the UOL selectivity increases while the selectivity to SAL decreases and that to SOL remained almost unchanged at a low level. The difference in the total conversion is not responsible for the changes in the selectivity to UOL and SAL since the selectivity depends little on the conversion at levels of 30–40%, as shown in Fig. 3. For those Pd/ZnO samples with different Pd loadings, the sizes of PdZn alloy crystallites have been estimated by XRD line broadening. The selectivity is plotted against the average crystallite size determined in Fig. 7 , which includes the result of the 1wt.% Pd sample reduced at 800°C as well. There is a trend that the UOL selectivity increases with the alloy crystallite size while the selectivity to SAL decreases and that to SOL does not change."
7,Reaction pathways and effects of alloy crystallite size,"3.3 Reaction pathways and effects of alloy crystallite size To obtain further information on reaction pathways, we used either UOL or SAL as a starting substrate. Tables 3 and 4 show the results obtained with Pd/ZnO as well as those with Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts. In the reaction with UOL, unexpected products of UAL and SAL were observed to form with Pd/ZnO along with the hydrogenation product, SOL. Both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of UOL took place with Pd/ZnO and SAL was formed through hydrogenation of the UAL formed. The formation of SAL could also occur by isomerization of UOL. For the other Pd catalysts, in contrast, such a dehydrogenation did not occur. For Pd/SiO2, a small quantity of SAL was observed, suggesting the occurrence of the isomerization to SAL and/or the dehydrogenation to UAL; if the latter occurred, its rate should be very slow compared with the hydrogenation to SAL. In the reaction with SAL, SOL was exclusively produced with Pd/ZnO. This is different from the product distribution with Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts, in which decarbonylation and/or condensation occur more dominantly than the hydrogenation to SOL. The dehydrogenation of UOL to UAL only occurs over Pd/ZnO catalyst, and no UAL are formed in the reaction with UOL over Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2. The hydrogen chemisorption capacity of Pd/ZnO catalyst is much less than Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts. A few part of PdZn alloy on ZnO support is covered with hydrogen, while the Pd metal on the Al2O3 or SiO2 support is fully covered with hydrogen. Hence, over Pd/ZnO, dehydrogenation of UOL to UAL occurs even though in the presence of hydrogen, due to low hydrogen adsorption ability, while, over Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts, only hydrogenation reaction occurs, giving SOL. These results demonstrate that when UOL is a substrate for the PdZn alloy catalyst, UOL is hydrogenated to SOL and dehydrogenated to UAL, which is hydrogenated to SOL through SAL. The possibility of isomerization of UOL to SAL cannot be denied. In addition, when SAL is a substrate, only hydrogenation to SOL occurs. Results for the PdZn alloy catalyst also suggested that the rate of conversion of SAL (to SOL) was smaller than that of UOL through hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and/or isomerization when either SAL or UOL is a starting substrate. Vannice and Sen previously made a kinetic analysis for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation with supported Pt catalysts [12]. They considered the hydrogenation pathways from UAL to UOL and SAL, from UOL to SAL, and from SAL to SAL along with the isomerization of UOL to SAL. They did not consider the dehydrogenation of UOL to UAL, which occurred with our PdZn alloy catalyst. The results indicated that the relative rates of those reaction pathways strongly depended on preparation conditions such as support material and reduction temperature. When the nature of Pt was modified with TiO2 on high temperature reduction, the UOL selectivity was improved. Recently, Touroude and co-workers studied crontonaldehyde hydrogenation using Pt catalysts supported on CeO2 at 180°C [14]. They showed that such a high reduction temperature as 700°C was effective for improving the UOL selectivity. They suggested that this improvement was due to the formation of CePt5 alloy species and/or Pt sites modified with CeO x or CeOCl. In our work, CeO2 support was also used for Pd but no alloy formation was observed on reduction at 500°C and the Pd/CeO2 catalyst was not selective for the formation of UOL. When the reactions starting with either UAL or UOL are compared, the selectivity to SOL with UAL is smaller by a factor of 1/5 than that with UOL at similar conversion levels (Tables 1 and 3). This suggests that the hydrogenation of UOL to SOL was suppressed to a rate comparable to that of SAL to SOL in UAL hydrogenation. One possible explanation is that the adsorption of UOL and SAL is weaker compared with UAL and that these hydrogenated species, this desorb soon after the formation, they are therefore unlikely to have a chance of further hydrogenation to SOL. The previous authors pointed out the importance of the strength of adsorption of substrates and products on the surface of catalysts for determining the product distribution in hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [7,12,14–18]. The present results obtained indicate some reaction pathways, as shown in Scheme 1 , for UAL hydrogenation with PdZn alloy catalyst. UAL is hydrogenated to UOL and SAL and the former is dehydrogenated back to UAL. The full hydrogenation to SOL is slower than the partial hydrogenation to UOL and SAL. The size of PdZn alloy crystallites affects the reaction; with an increase in the size, the selectivity to UOL increases while that to SAL decreases and that to SOL remains unchanged at a low level, as shown in Fig. 7. This improvement of the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol agrees with the trends observed with monometallic catalysts, which are due to steric and/or electronic effects [7]. However, the range of crystallite size considered here is very large; it extends up to more than 100nm, much beyond the molecular level. As discussed above, the hydrogenation of either UOL or SAL to SOL is slow in the presence of UAL. The small PdZn crystallites are favorable for the hydrogenation of UAL to SAL, but with the increasing size of PdZn alloy crystallites, it becomes more difficult to occur compared with the hydrogenation of UAL to UOL. The selectivity to SOL did not change so much with the crystallite size and so the rates of hydrogenation of UOL and SAL to SOL should be comparably low irrespective of the size. The H2 adsorption measurements indicated that the Pd/ZnO catalysts did not chemisorb H2 so much; the amounts of chemisorbed H2 on the 10wt.% Pd/ZnO catalysts reduced at 220°C and 500°C were 9.3mmol (H2)/g and 4.8mmol (H2)/g, respectively; these were less than 1% of the total amount of Pd loaded. The former catalyst contains metallic Pd as well as PdZn alloy but in the latter the Pd is almost alloyed with Zn as seen from XRD results (Fig. 5). Then, the low H2 chemisorption ability may result from the formation of PdZn alloy and/or a small quantity of exposed Pd atoms due to large size of Pd and PdZn crystallites and/or to a possibility that a large fraction of Pd atoms exist in the bulk even with our preparation procedures. The low H2 adsorption ability may also be significant because it indicate that the amount of the doubly hydrogenated product, SOL formed was small with our PdZn alloy catalysts, in addition to the difference in the strength of adsorption between the substrate (UAL) and the products (UOL, SAL) as discussed above. Further, scanning electron microscopy/X-ray microanalysis (SEM/XMA) has been used to examine the catalysts. Fig. 8 gives typical SEM pictures, showing that the size of crystallites increased with the quantity of Pd loading and that the crystallites aggregated into larger ones for the sample calcined at 800°C, in accordance with the XRD results. SEM/XMA studies have been made on the areas of Fig. 9 , the Pd/Zn ratios at the positions indicated are given in Table 5 . The ratios are not unexpected values given the quantities of Pd loaded on these catalysts. The nominal Pd/Zn ratios are 1.2%, 6.2%, and 12% for the 1wt.%, 5wt.%, and 10wt.% Pd-loaded catalysts, respectively. So, we suggest that Pd atoms are not embedded in the bulk but are dispersed on the top layers of the catalysts. Table 5 shows that the Pd/Zn ratio does not change so much with the positions for the catalysts including 1wt.% and 5wt.% Pd, being 1.7–2.4% and 3.2–5.3%, respectively. For the 10wt.% Pd-loaded catalyst, the ratio significantly depends on the positions measured, ranging from 4.6% to 70%. Smaller Pd/Zn ratios of 1.5–0.4% are seen for the 1wt.% Pd sample calcined at 800°C. Comparison with the results of Fig. 7 indicates that the Pd/Zn ratio measured by SEM/XMA is not related to the product distribution. The present system is complicated in that PdZn alloy is formed from supported Pd and the support material during reduction. It was not possible to distinguish PdZn alloy crystallites and ZnO support ones from our SEM/XMA measurements. Again we may say that the larger PdZn crystallites are more favorable for the UOL formation (Fig. 7) but more detailed physicochemical aspects remain as open questions. Microscopic surface analysis of the PdZn alloy catalysts may be needed."
8,Conclusion,"The conversion and product distribution in gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde on supported Pd catalysts strongly depend on the support materials used. The activity of Pd/ZnO catalyst is lower but its selectivity to crotyl alcohol is much higher compared with the values for the catalysts using SiO2, Al2O3, and others. The enhanced selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol is due to the formation of PdZn alloy in Pd/ZnO catalyst on reduction, in contrast to the other catalysts in which only metallic Pd species are present. The total conversion with Pd/ZnO catalyst decreases slightly with the size of PdZn alloy crystallites. The selectivity to crotyl alcohol increases with the size in the range up to more than 100nm in diameter, while that to butyraldehyde decreases. The selectivity to the fully hydrogenated product, n-butyl alcohol, is low irrespective of the PdZn crystallite size."
