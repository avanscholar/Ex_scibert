0,Introduction,"The global energy transition to commercially viable renewable sources is a possible solution to combat the adversity of abrupt climate change. It can be enabled and accelerated by technologies that convert renewables into high-energy chemicals, reduce CO2 emissions, and mitigate the effects of climate change. A few examples include solar energy-mediated water splitting, CO2 conversion, organic pollutant degradation in wastewater, and organic synthesis. In particular, photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen is a favorable option to meet the demand for sustainable energy sources owing to the availability of unlimited energy and potential of near-zero emission from sunlight (Shaner et al., 2016; Chandran et al., 2018). During the solar energy-mediated water splitting reaction, photoexcited electrons and holes are generated upon light irradiation, transferred to the surface of the photocatalyst whereby they reduce protons to molecular hydrogen and oxidize hydroxide anions to molecular oxygen (Hisatomi et al., 2014). The oxygen evolution reaction involving the transfer of four electrons and holes is a limiting reaction responsible for the sluggish kinetics of the entire water splitting reaction (Blakemore et al., 2015). Therefore, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) often combine photoreduction of water with photooxidation (or photoreforming) of sacrificial electron donors such as triethanolamine (TEOA), methanol (MeOH), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), and biofuels that are more easily oxidized than water (Loow et al., 2016; Kennedy et al., 2018; Uekert et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2019). Versatile electron donors that are produced from conventional industries or yield value-added products (VAPs) during the photooxidation process and are more easily oxidized than water are highly in demand. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) or polymeric melon is a promising semiconductor photocatalyst owing to 1) a narrow bandgap of 2.7 eV with a suitable band position for water splitting as well as CO2 conversion, 2) a simple method of preparation via thermal polymerization of inexpensive precursors such as cyanamide (CA), dicyandiamide (DCDA), melamine (M), and urea (U), and 3) its high intrinsic chemical/thermal stability (Wang et al., 2009; Jun et al., 2013b). Most metal-based photocatalysts have some limitations for the practical utilization due to their toxicity, instability, and difficulty for modifying band structures, etc. (Li et al., 2017); therefore, to develop a g-CN-based metal-free photocatalyst with non-toxicity, intrinsic chemical and thermal stability, and high tunability of its chemical and electronic structure is demanding. For this, synthetic strategies have been adopted to improve its moderate absorption of visible light and rapid charge recombination of the photoexcited electron and hole pairs (EHPs), which are pointed out as main challenges for practically utilizing g-CN-based photocatalyst. These strategies aim to 1) modify the morphology by hydrothermal treatment, supramolecular assemblies, and templating (Chen et al., 2009; Jun et al., 2013a, 2013b), 2) induce a higher degree of polycondensation or crystal structures using molten salt of an alkali metal halide (Bojdys et al., 2008; Wirnhier et al., 2011), 3) improve the electronic properties by metal inclusion or doping inorganic heteroatoms like P or I (Zhang et al., 2010, 2014a), and 4) introduce functional moieties or structural defects like urea moiety or cyano groups and nitrogen-vacancies that are catalytically active for enhanced photoexcited charge carrier kinetics using reductive chemicals such as NaBH4 or KOH (Liu et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017). Despite the extent of research carried out to advance the photocatalytic activity of g-CN, its practical or industrial implementation is yet to be achieved owing to the absence of systematic studies to associate the fabrication of the catalyst with the design of a photocatalytic reactor. Nano-sized or low-dimensional materials such as quantum dots (QDs) are still favored because such small nanoparticles have a high population of catalytically active sites and shortened charge or mass transfer pathways and both these features are crucial for efficient photocatalysis (Fresno et al., 2014). Nevertheless, this approach is not considered to be practical as these particles are easily agglomerated into large particles in a reaction solution due to inter-particle adhesion. This results in a negative effect on the photocatalyst in terms of porous structures and subsequent indication of optical properties such as light penetration or the scattering effect. The collective properties of particles such as particle density, size/spatial distribution, surface potential, and aggregation development must be considered as crucial factors for practical applications. This motivated us to prepare macroscopic photocatalyst monoliths featuring a forward lobe of Mie scattering, providing better light irradiation on the catalyst slurry that gradually increases with increasing particle size (Xu et al., 2012). We used a novel synthetic strategy that enabled the fabrication of condensed, macroscopic g-CN monoliths from a monodisperse large organic crystal as a precursor. Melamine (M) and trithiocyanuric acid (TCA) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); then 1) fast precipitation of white to bright yellow particles with the addition of the poor solvent, water (Jun et al., 2013b) or 2) slow precipitation without adding water in the DMSO solution was carried out. The resulting organic single crystals of different colors and particle sizes were heated to 550 °C to generate g-CN. The distinct feature of the synthesis is that it offers a facile solution-processed crystal engineering process that enables the control of the morphology, porous structure, heteroatom doping degree, and even the particle size of the resulting g-CN at the molecular level (Jun et al., 2013a). Two different materials, MTCA-10-CN (melamine-trithiocyanuric acid single crystal carbon nitride with smaller particle size) and MTCA-100-CN (melamine-trithiocyanuric acid single crystal carbon nitride with larger particle size), are produced that can be utilized for two different applications of hydrogen evolution and glucose photoreforming. Photocatalytic HERs with crystal-engineered MTCA-10-CN and MTCA-100-CN in the presence of glucose were conducted to reduce organic wastes and simultaneously produce VAPs using g-CN-based photocatalysts, while maintaining processability. In addition, the photooxidation of glucose, a well-known monomer of various organic materials that is produced by the alkaline hydrolysis of biomass, was carried out to evaluate the potential of the MTCA-X-CN (X = 10, 100) for photoreforming of commercial high-molecular materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and lignocellulosic biomass. A reaction medium of 5 M NaOH aqueous solution was used to carry out the process of alkaline hydrolysis, which is a known process for the pretreatment of waste plastics or degradation of biomass (Loow et al., 2016; Uekert et al., 2018)."
1,Materials and methods,"Synthesis of MTCA- 10-CN: In a typical synthesis, melamine (0.3 g, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., Germany) and trithiocyanuric acid (0.468 g, 95%, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., Germany) were dissolved in DMSO (20 mL, 99.5%, Daejung Co., Republic of Korea). After stirring for 12 h for complete dissolution, 3rd DI water (10 mL) was added to the mixed solution to obtain a bright yellow precipitate. The mixture was then filtered through a glass fiber filter (Whatman, UK) with sufficient ethanol (94.5%, Daejung Co., Republic of Korea). The resulting bright yellow powder was dried at 80 °C and labeled as ‘MTCA-10’. It was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 2.3 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere. The brown-colored aggregated powder thus obtained was labeled as ‘MTCA-10-CN’, where ‘10’ indicates the particle size in μm. Synthesis of MTCA- 100-CN: The same process was adopted as before for mixing the precursor solutions. Without the addition of DI water, the solution was left in a fume hood for 10 days to obtain yellow crystals that were labeled as ‘MTCA-100’ and heated to 550 °C at the same ramping rate as before. The resulting bright brown monolith particles were labeled as ‘MTCA-100-CN’, where ‘100’ indicates the particle size in μm. Characterization: The surface morphologies and structures were studied using an analytical high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM, Hitachi SU-70, Japan). Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured to determine the pore structure at 77 K using a TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics, USA). The crystallinity was analyzed from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns that were generated using a Rigaku D/max Ultima III with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 Å) (Rigaku, Japan). The particle size analysis (PSA) in water was conducted using an ELS-8000 (Otsuka, Japan). The elemental analysis (EA) was performed on a vario MICRO cube (ELEMENTAR, Germany) for N, C, H, and S analysis, and Flash 2000 (Thermo Fisher, Italy) for O analysis. The UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV/Vis DRS) analysis was conducted from 200 to 800 nm using a Lambda 365 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA). The photoluminescence (PL) analysis excited at 350 nm was performed using a FluoroMax-4 (Horiba, Japan). The electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed using a JES-FA200 (Jeol Ltd., Japan) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured using a JACSO FT-IR 4100 spectrometer (JACSO Inc., Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a K-Alpha+ XPS spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) micro-focused on an Al Kα line source. The carbon species of the samples were identified at 400 MHz using solid-state 13C cross polarization-magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (JNM-ECZ400R/S3, JEOL Ltd., Japan). Photocatalytic activity: The photocatalytic activity was measured via two reaction systems: photocatalytic HERs from water (with TEOA) and glucose oxidation. To evaluate the photocatalytic HER rate from water, a catalyst (25 mg) was dispersed in DI water (25 mL) containing H2PtCl6 (99.9995%, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and TEOA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., Germany, 10 vol%) contained in a homemade slurry quartz reactor (50 mL) (Figure S1) (Jun et al., 2013b; Kang et al., 2021). The Pt cocatalyst (7 wt%) was photo-deposited onto the surface of g-CN during the HERs. The dispersion was purged with nitrogen to remove the residual air. Visible light was generated by a 300 W Xenon lamp (6258, Newport, USA) installed in a lamp house (66902, Newport, USA) with a 420 nm cut-on filter (FSQ-GG420, Newport, USA). The temperature was maintained at 27 °C using an electric fan. The evolved hydrogen in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed by gas chromatography (DS 6200, Donam Instrument Inc., Korea). To evaluate the photocatalytic HER rate by glucose oxidation, a catalyst (25 mg) was dispersed in 5 M NaOH aqueous solution (25 mL) containing H2PtCl6 and glucose (98%, JUNSEI Co., Japan, 83.3 mg) (pH = 13.2) in the same quartz reactor (Uekert et al., 2018). The Pt cocatalyst (7 wt%) was photo-deposited onto the surface of g-CN during the HERs. The dispersion was then purged with nitrogen to remove the residual air. Solar radiation was generated by a 300 W Xenon lamp installed in the solar simulator (91160A-1000, Newport, USA) with an AM1.5G filter (81388, Newport, USA). The temperature was maintained at 27 °C using an electric fan. The hydrogen evolved in the headspace of the reactor was analyzed using gas chromatography. The measurement of the amount of hydrogen evolved by the photoreactions was repeated several times in both the applications for reliability. Photoelectrochemical analysis: Mott–Schottky measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and photocurrent measurements were conducted with a quartz-type beaker cell equipped with conductive glass as the working electrode, platinum as the counter electrode (CE-100, EC-Frointer, Japan), and Ag/AgCl saturated with 3 M KCl as a reference electrode (RE-Ag/AgCl-Glass-06-70-00-00-00, Wizmac, Republic of Korea) using VSP (BioLogic, France). The working electrode was prepared by drop-casting catalyst slurry. First, the catalyst (50 mg) was dispersed in ethanol (2 mL) containing Nafion solution (0.2 mL, 5 wt% in lower aliphatic alcohols and water contains 15–20% water, Sigma-Aldrich Co., Germany). Then, the slurry (100 μL) was cast onto a conductive glass (fluorine-doped tin oxide glass, FTO) and dried overnight at 60 °C under vacuum. After filling the cell with a supporting electrolyte of 0.2 M Na2SO4 (120 mL, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich Co., Germany) aqueous solution (for photocurrent, 0.333 g of glucose was added), the configurated cell was purged with N2 for 30 min to remove the residual air and tested under ambient conditions (Kang et al., 2021). The EIS analysis was conducted at a fixed potential of +0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl from 500 kHz to 4 mHz (Jun et al., 2013b; Kang et al., 2021), and the photocurrent was measured at a fixed potential of +0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with solar light irradiation (AM1.5G) (Jun et al., 2013b)."
2,Results and discussion,"High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) analysis was carried out (Fig. 1 ) to examine the morphology, particle size, and porous structure of MTCA-10, MTCA-100, and their derivative-carbon nitrides (MTCA-X-CN, X = 10, 100). Organic precursors exhibited different particle sizes of almost 10 μm and over 0.1 mm for MTCA-10 and MTCA-100, respectively, and the difference in particle size was significant even after calcination (Fig. 1, S2). Moreover, their 3D monolith-like morphology, that resembled a hollow-monolith structure containing a few thin layers formed by gasification inside the structure, was maintained after calcination at 550 °C under an inert N2 atmosphere. The successful formation of millimeter-long crystals was successfully achieved via slow precipitation of the DMSO solution whereas instantaneous precipitation using a poor solvent (water) yielded relatively small crystals; large crystals yielded a macroscopic g-CN monolith, as shown in the photographs (Fig. 2 a). A similar result was seen in the particle size analysis (PSA), where the particle size distribution ranged from 0.2 to 25 μm for MTCA-10-CN (Fig. 2b–d). In the case of MTCA-100-CN, the particle size distribution data were unavailable because their size was much larger than the upper detection limit of the machine. It must be noted that typical g-CNs prepared from DCDA and melamine (M) show size distributions from 70 nm to 260 μm for DCDA-CN and 60 nm to 160 μm for M-CN. Even in the case of MTCA-10-CN, the particle size was greater than a couple of hundred nm that is obtained more easily as compared to nanosized particles in both the typical g-CNs. It is important to maintain the intrinsic particle size even after sonication and long-time stirring for efficient catalyst recovery. MTCA-100-CN retained its particle size in water as well as 5 M NaOH aqueous solution after dispersing for 6 h. In addition, MTCA-100-CN showed a faster sink (several minutes) than MTCA-10-CN, indicating less dispersibility (Figure S3). The specific crystallinity of the organic precursors was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns; both MTCA-10 and MTCA-100 showed similar crystal-based diffraction patterns to the previously reported MTCA-DMSO-30 (CCDC 973873) (Jun et al., 2013b), which is synthesized by the similar process (Figure S4), however, after calcination, the difference in their structural order became apparent. To provide more details of the intrinsic microstructure, several parameters such as 1) the size of the crystallite (La and Lc), 2) intra- and inter-layer distances (d100 and d002), and 3) stacking numbers of the graphitic crystallites were calculated from the XRD patterns of MTCA-10-CN and MTCA-100-CN using the Scherrer equation and Bragg's law (Fig. 3 a, Table 1 ). The interplanar distances between the 2D graphene-like layers of MTCA-10-CN and MTCA-100-CN were calculated to be 0.34 nm and 0.33 nm, respectively, whereas the stacking number of MTCA-100-CN (8.24) was larger than that of MTCA-10-CN (5.45). In contrast, the distances between the tri-s-triazine repeating units in MTCA-10-CN and MTCA-100-CN were calculated to be 0.66 nm and 0.67 nm, respectively, using a scattering peak at ~13° corresponding to (100) reflection of g-CN. The size of the graphitic crystallite in MTCA-100-CN in the direction of the a-axis (4.06 nm) was smaller than that of MTCA-10-CN (4.73 nm). All these parameters indicated that MTCA-100-CN, prepared from a larger organic single-crystal precursor, had higher graphitic stacking and lower in-plane structural order. We attributed this to the size of the MTCA-100 crystal precursor: the evolution of NH3 gas during thermal polycondensation inside the crystal structure disturbs the polycondensation by the gas templating effect, however, it must be noted that the difference in the in-plane structure is not as critical as that in the inter-layer structure. The N2 sorption analysis showed that the specific surface area and pore volumes were 22.15 m2/g and 0.13 cm3/g, respectively, for MTCA-100-CN; these values were lower than those for MTCA-10-CN (34.1 m2/g and 0.2 cm3/g) (Fig. 3b). This can be explained by the larger crystal size of the precursor; the larger particle with greater linkage suffers less shrinkage during calcination (Fig. 1). The elemental analysis (EA) also showed a similar result of the XRD patterns, where MTCA-100-CN had a slightly lower C/N ratio (0.67) than that (0.68) of MTCA-10-CN, indicating the less developed in-plane structure of MTCA-100-CN (Table S1). In addition, there were trace amounts of sulfur in both MTCA-10-CN and MTCA-100-CN inherited from the TCA-based precursor, indicating that sulfur doping is easily achievable (Zhang et al., 2011; Jun et al., 2013b). Despite the disparity between MTCA-10-CN and MTCA-100-CN in terms of morphology, size, and microstructure, there were no significant differences in the chemical environment. The analysis by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and solid-state 13C cross polarization-magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed almost no differences. The FT-IR spectra of the MTCA-10-CN samples showed a single peak at 810 cm−1 and multiple peaks between 1200 and 1600 cm−1, assigned to the out-of-plane bending vibration of the triazine ring and stretching vibration of the aromatic CN heterocycles, respectively (Figure S5) (Bojdys et al., 2008). A weak bump at approximately 3250 cm−1 indicated the uncondensed amine groups in the g-CN structure (Bojdys et al., 2008). Moreover, in the 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra, there were two characteristic peaks at 157 ppm and 165 ppm indicating a typical tri-s-triazine-based carbon nitride structure (Figure S6) (Jurgens et al., 2003) whereas in the high-resolution N 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), there was one observable change in the perspective of the polycondensation degree (Figure S7). The areal ratio of the N–C3 to C–NC peak, signifying the degree of polymerization (or polycondensation), was calculated to be 0.33 and 0.28 for MTCA-10-CN and MTCA-100-CN, respectively, and indicated a lower degree of polymerization among the tri-s-triazine units via the bridging trigonal nitrogen (N–C3) in MTCA-100-CN (Thomas et al., 2008). For the larger organic crystal precursor of MTCA-100, a more condensed g-CN in the z-direction was obtained in MTCA-100-CN. The UV/visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of MTCA-10-CN and MTCA-100-CN were examined to evaluate the light absorption and radiative charge recombination of photoexcited EHPs. MTCA-100-CN showed less absorption of light over the entire wavelength range and a slightly blue-shifted profile with a larger bandgap (2.97 eV) than that (2.88 eV) of MTCA-10-CN (Fig. 4 a, Figure S8). This results from the condensed phase characteristics of MTCA-100-CN, where the reduced distance in the direction of the (002) reflection increases the repulsive force between the pi-clouds of each 2D graphene-like layer, thus hindering the absorption of light with hypsochromic-shifted absorption profile (Thomas et al., 2008). In addition, there was an additional bump near 500 nm for both the samples that indicated the improved electronic structures due to sulfur doping (Ma et al., 2012); also, this can partly be attributed to the effect of the morphology of both MTCA-100-CN and MTCA-10-CN. It was previously reported that 3D-hollow morphologies could enhance light absorption by scattering and further absorbing the light that penetrated the hollow particles (Li et al., 2007; Jun et al., 2013a). This result agreed well with the results of PL emission spectroscopy. MTCA-100-CN showed a blue-shift in the emission spectrum as compared to MTCA-10-CN (Fig. 4b); however, the photocurrent showed results to the contrary (Fig. 4c). MTCA-100-CN exhibited a light-induced current density (~0.2 μA/cm2) in the presence of glucose whereas MTCA-10-CN showed a lesser current density (<0.1 μA/cm2). These results lead us to expect an enhanced performance of MTCA-100-CN in glucose photoreforming as compared to that of MTCA-10-CN. Nevertheless, the constantly observed overpotential in MTCA-100-CN indicated that its mass or charge transfer resistance for the photoreforming reaction may be unfavorable; the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with the equivalent circuit of both the samples showed a much higher resistance (Rct) for MTCA-100-CN (3.52E18) than MTCA-10-CN (1.62E06) (Figure S9; Table S2) (Wang et al., 2019). The results of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy showed that MTCA-100-CN had a slightly higher intensity than MTCA-10-CN at a g-value of 2.0019, indicating an increased density of the unpaired electrons on the sp 2 -hybridized carbon and nitrogen atoms (Fig. 4d) (Tabbal et al., 2005). The difference between the g-values of MTCA-X-CN and those of the typical bulk g-CN (g = 2.0034) may be due to the sulfur doping in their structures that exert a strong influence on the electron or hole distribution on and over the tri-s-triazine molecules (Tabbal et al., 2005). The photocatalytic activity was evaluated using two reaction systems (Fig. 5 a): (1) the hydrogen evolution reaction from water with the sacrificial electron donor of TEOA was conducted. MTCA-100-CN produced 11.84 μmol/h of hydrogen that is 0.7 times lesser than that (16.61 μmol/h) produced by MTCA-10-CN in 2 h of photoreaction. However, (2) the sequential photoreforming reaction with glucose in 5 M NaOH aqueous solution showed that MTCA-100-CN produced 2.8 times more hydrogen (3.19 μmol/h) than MTCA-10-CN (1.14 μmol/h). The band structure was investigated by Mott-Schottky analysis combined with UV/Vis DRS to explain this conflicting result. It was confirmed that MTCA-100-CN had a more positive HOMO level (1.69 eV vs. Ag/AgCl saturated 3 M KCl) than that (1.60 eV vs. Ag/AgCl saturated 3 M KCl) of MTCA-10-CN with the larger bandgap (2.97 eV for MTCA-100-CN and 2.88 eV for MTCA-10-CN) (Figure S10). This provided MTCA-100-CN with a higher capability of oxidation for glucose photoreforming. As reported in earlier studies, the photoreforming of glucose is a step-by-step reaction in the presence of hydroxyl radicals (·OH), where the photogenerated hydroxyl radicals react with glucose to form H+ and RCH2O. Subsequently, the dissociative RCH2O traps hydroxyl radicals to form RHO radicals. These radicals attack the glucose molecules by repeating the process continuously (Fig. 5b) (Fu et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Iervolino et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2019). As a result, glucose photoreforming takes place with hydrogen gas obtained simultaneously as a VAP with the MTCA-100-CN photocatalyst. In comparison with other potential materials, MTCA-100-CN showed significant efficacy in degrading glucose with evolution of hydrogen (Table 2 ). Although it lacks the efficiency of metal-based catalysts, it is a metal-free photocatalyst that is designated as an alternative and advanced polymer-based semiconducting photocatalyst for the glucose photoreforming. Moreover, particle-size-grown photocatalysts are generally unfavorable for light-catalyst interactions or reaction kinetics such as charge transfer resistance. This is evident from the optoelectronic properties, where MTCA-100-CN showed lesser absorption and higher emission profiles, overpotential, and charge transfer resistance than MTCA-10-CN, as seen from the UV/Vis DRS, PL, photocurrent, and EIS analyses, respectively. In spite of these disadvantages, it is interesting to note that the performance of MTCA-100-CN in glucose photoreforming is superior to that of MTCA-10-CN, implying the importance of oxidation capability of photocatalysts for photooxidation."
3,Conclusions,"The present study utilized a unique strategy of solution-mediated crystallization and facile engineering to fabricate a macroscopic crystalline g-CN (MTCA-100-CN) by a solution-processed molecular cooperative assembly. It is demonstrated that the crystallization process and increasing particle size helped to control the size of the resulting g-CN with a significant effect on its microstructure, electronic structure, and photocatalytic activity. MTCA-100-CN exhibited a larger graphitic stacking (8.24) with reduced interlayer distance (0.33 nm) and a comparatively enlarged band gap (2.97 eV) than that of MTCA-10-CN for which the corresponding values were 5.45, 0.34 nm, and 2.88 eV, respectively. A more positive HOMO position (1.69 eV vs. Ag/AgCl) of MTCA-100-CN provided an efficient oxidation capability for glucose; thus, it produced 2.79 times more hydrogen (3.19 μmol/h) than MTCA-10-CN (1.14 μmol/h). The findings in this study demonstrate the potential of recoverable monolith-type g-CN for degrading biomass with the production of VAPs such as hydrogen."
