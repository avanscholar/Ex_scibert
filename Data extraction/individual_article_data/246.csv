0,Introduction,"As non-renewable energy sources (such as traditional fossil fuel oil) are gradually exhausted, energy deficiency in this highly populated world is emerging as a priority issue. Energy supply has also become tended to be the most important issue of the 21st Century [1]. Solar energy, as a clean, abundant, and economically effective energy source, has great application potential. However, the conversion rate of solar energy is still relatively low. Moreover, solar energy must first be captured and converted into other useful forms of energy before it can be effectively employed [1,2]. Owing to its high energy capacity, hydrogen has recently received great interest as an environmentally sustainable energy carrier, such as electricity, for practical application. As a zero-pollutant-emission fuel, hydrogen can be easily generated by exploiting renewable energy sources, or from hydrogen-rich compounds and steam-methane reforming systems [3–5]. However, implementing such a system would require intermediate production by electrolysis, a complicated operation method, or fossil fuels [1]. Therefore, employing solar energy to produce hydrogen by splitting water is a more cost-effective and environmentally sustainable approach. However, this is still challenging as there is a lack of efficient photocatalysts that can convert form energy into chemical energy for hydrogen production [6–9]. This is mainly due to the rapid recombination of the photogenerated electron-holes and the slow charge carrier transfer rate, which greatly affect the light quantum efficiency. This would thereby reduce the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. Several photocatalytic materials cannot be widely used as they are only sufficiently activated by ultraviolet light. This is inconvenient for practical application. Thus, a stable and efficient photocatalysis approach to water splitting that can absorb visible light would be more promising for the effective utilization of solar energy [10]. In the field of visible light-steered photocatalysis for hydrogen production, significant attention has been paid toward reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron-holes and increasing the charge transfer to improve the performance of photocatalysts [11–13]. For example, graphene and its derivative (i.e., reduced graphene oxide (RGO)) have been mentioned in the photocatalysis fields owing to their distinct structures, electronic characteristics, and specific surface area [14]. Incorporating functional graphene into semiconductor materials for fabricating functional of graphene-based composites can enhance the electronic and photocatalytic characteristics of a material [15]. Moreover, the two-dimensional (2D) p-p conjugation structure of graphene could be used as an electron acceptor to augment electron transport and reduce the rate of photogenerated electron-holes recombination, thereby increasing photocatalytic activity [16,17]. Additionally, owing to the introduction of graphene, the band gap to be operated in the visible-light region could be narrowed through graphene-semiconductor composite photocatalysts. Cerium, the most abundant rare earth element, is present in approximately 0.0046% of the Earth`s crust by weight [18]. Cerium dioxide (CeO2) powder is used more often than traditional polishing powder (such as iron powder) due to its high polishing speed, long service life, and easy removal of stains in an environmentally sustainable manner. In addition, owing to its excellent biocompatibility, high electronic conductivity, low toxicity, great chemical stability, and high surface to volume ratio, CeO2 also has been extensively applied in many fields (such as low-temperature oxidation, absorption, alcohol-to-oxygen conversion, solid fuel cell, and waste water treatment) [19–21]. Furthermore, photocatalytic activity can be synergistically enhanced by doping cerium, as the redox couple Ce3+/Ce4+can be transferred between Ce2O3 and CeO2 through either oxidation or reduction. This could be attributed to the different electron orbit distribution structures of Ce3+(4f15d0) and Ce4+(4f05d0), resulting in different optical catalytic properties [22,23]. Tang et al. [24] synthesized one-dimensional CeO2 nanotubes as photocatalysts, revealing its higher benzene degradation performance than that of titanium dioxide. Gionco et al. [25] synthesized nanostructured Ce and Er-doped ZrO2 with hydrothermal method as solar light driven photocatalysts for recalcitrant pollutants abatement, and the results showed that all doped materials significantly enhanced the photoactivity under irradiation with simulated solar light. Therefore, to generate energy, a RGO and CeO2 composite could be synthesized as a photocatalyst that can even function under visible light to generate hydrogen from water decomposition. However, there have been very few reports of the use of this composite nanomaterial in renewable energy generation. In this study, an effective and simple method is introduced to synthesize cerium oxide nanowires (CNWs) via a hydrothermal reaction with different contents of GO for preparing CNW-RGO photocatalysts by doping. To our best knowledge, this method provides a new nano-photocatalytic material for fabricating a highly efficient photocatalytic system for H2 generation. This is the first attempt to employ such photocatalysts for hydrogen production. In this system, CNWs act as a light-exciter, and the GO sheets serve as the photogenerated-electron receptor and carrier. As significant numbers of functional groups were generated on the surface of the GO sheets, photogenerated electrons can be easily transferred from CNW to the reactive sites on the GO sheets for H2 production. The composite nanomaterials exhibited high photocatalysis efficiency and stability in an aqueous solution. The surface morphology, chemistry, optics level, DFT, TOF, polarity of sacrificial agents, and hydrogen production performance were also investigated. This study emphasizes the remarkable performance of cerium nanowires and graphene in the establishment of highly efficient carbon semiconductor-based composite photocatalysts and provides new insights into hydrogen production from photocatalytic water splitting."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Graphite sheet, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, potassium permanganate, sodium nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, cerium chloride, propanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, ethanol, and 1,2-propanediol and methanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification. Deionized water was used in all experiments."
3,Synthesis of photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of photocatalysts 2.2.1 Preparation of graphite oxide GO was synthesized using the modified Hummers’ method. First, 2.5 g of graphite powders were oxidized by mixing with 1.25 g of NaNO3 and 60 mL of H2SO4. 7.5 g of KMnO4 was then gradually added, and the container was steeped in an ice bath to maintain the temperature below 5 °C. After that, the mixed solution was allowed to continue for 40 min at below 35 °C. Subsequently, the temperature was heated to 95 °C with addition of DI water, and held for 30 min. Afterward, 30 mL of 20% H2O2 was added dropwise. The final mixture was filtered and washed several times with water and 5% HCl solution. After ultrasonication, we obtained a few-layers GO with significant oxygen content. 2.2.2 Preparation of CNWs NaOH solution (10 M) was mixed initially with the CeCl3 solution (0.08 M) under vigorous stirring to obtain a violet solution. After 30 min ultrasonication, the mixed violet solution was placed into a Teflon autoclave for 24 h at 180 °C. The final products were washed, filtrated, and dried at 60 °C for overnight. 2.2.3 Preparation of CNW-RGO photocatalysts CNW-RGO was obtained via hydrothermal reaction. A designated ratio of the prepared GO solution was added into the CNWs. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min to form a dispersion solution. Next, the suspension was placed in a Teflon autoclave and maintained for five hours at 140 °C. Then, the obtained solutions were washed and filtered using DI water. The CNW-RGO powders were finally obtained after drying at 80 °C. Additionally, the different composites were obtained by changing the amount of GO. For example, the CNW-xRGO composites were fabricated with x wt.% RGO."
4,Characterization of photocatalysts,"2.3 Characterization of photocatalysts The crystal structure of the obtained photocatalysts was measured using a D/MAX-2500 X-ray diffractometer (XRD), with a 40-kV nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation source and current of 30 mA over the 2θ range of 10°−80° (λ = 1.54056 Å). The morphology of the samples was assessed by hitachi-S-4800 field emission SEM (FE-SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) using an F20 S-TWIN electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The composite catalysts were scanned using an ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) spectrometer at a wavelength of 200–800 nm to determine their optical properties. The pure catalysts were placed in quartz glassware without any other reagent and directly sent to the spectrometer for analysis. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the materials were analyzed at room temperature using a Nicolet iS 10 spectrometer to investigate the functional groups of the composites at a scanning wavelength of 4000–650 cm−1. The specific surface area was determined by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements from an ASAP 2020 N apparatus in the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda calculation modes. The DFT were conducted using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code based on the DFT + U method. Moreover, the exchange and correlation interactions were simulated using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) function. The Brillouin zone integration was set with a k-point mesh of 5 × 6 × 1 and an energy cutoff of 571 eV. The valence of elements was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The transient photocurrent responses were measured on a photoelectrochemical analyzer (CHI660E) in a standard three-electrode system with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, keeping the potential at of 0.5 V."
5,Photocatalytic H2 production,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 production H2 production was conducted in a sealed quartz annular with an 8 W high-pressure mercury vapor lamp as the UV light source and a lamp with a wavelength of 400–800 nm as the visible light source. The reactor volume was 800 mL and included a magnetic stirrer at the bottom. The H2 evolution rate of the 0.5 g L−1 photocatalyst in an aqueous solution with 20 vol% methanol was determined. The temperature for all photocatalytic reactions was maintained at 25 °C. Prior to irradiation, the mixture solution was purged under nitrogen for 30 min to completely remove any residual oxygen at atmospheric pressure. Once the experiment had begun, samples were collected at designated intervals for four hours. The H2 concentration was analyzed by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (N2 carrier and 5 Å molecular sieve column)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology and structure,"3.1 Morphology and structure 3.1.1 FE-SEM and HR-TEM To elucidate the microscopic characteristics of the photocatalysts, the morphologies of the prepared photocatalysts were determinate by FE-SEM and HR-TEM. Fig. 1 (a) presents the three-dimensional (3D) structure of RGO, and exhibits thin wrinkles. The RGO exhibited a flake-like shape that was almost transparent, and one or two stacked layers (Fig. 1(d)). Thus, the RGO was thinner than that in previous reports [26]. The low number of stacked graphene sheets, which was aided by Ce deposition, may promote electron transfer. As shown in Fig. 1(b) and 1 (e), alkali heat treatment produced uniform CNWs with a length ranging from 10 to 200 nm and an average diameter of 22 nm. Additionally, the CNWs were well-dispersed on the surfaces of the RGO sheets, and the CNW-loaded sheets were shorter than the unloaded sheets (Fig. 1(c) and (f)). This suggests that loading CNWs onto the graphene layers may alter the nanowires through the synthesis of a solvothermal method. The behavior may be attributed to ultrasonication shattering part of CNWs, leading to the change in length. This result seemed to agree well with the results of other studies. For example, Hamandi et al. observed similar results when synthesizing reduced graphene oxide/TiO2, which formed a structure other than nanotubes [27]. According to the Fig. 1(c) and (f), CNWs can be dispersed on the graphene oxide sheets, and still form nanowires. This suggested that CNW-graphene oxide interactions cannot fully redisperse CNWs nanowires [27]. In the structure with nanowires, the distance between the photogenerated electrons and the carrier was likely shorter than that of other structures. Furthermore, when combined with the thin layer structure of RGO, this change promoted the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CNW to the surface of the RGO, indicating that photocatalytic hydrogen production was efficient. Moreover, the electron motion was altered by the sheets, thereby providing appropriate hydrogen production sites. Additionally, the well-dispersed structure improved the separation of the photogenerated electrons-holes due to their high mobility throughout the sheets and further improved the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production [28]. 3.1.2 XRD As shown in the XRD results (Fig. 2 ), the diffraction peak (002) of RGO at 26.5° in the phase structure of the photocatalysts was typical and strong, suggesting that GO was successfully reduced [29]. This could be attributed to the disappearance of some oxygen-containing functional groups during the hydrothermal reduction reaction. The peaks located at 2θ of 28.6°, 33.2°, 47.3°, and 56.2° were generated by the (111), (200), (220), and (222) diffraction of CNW in accordance with JCPDS card no. 81-0792, respectively [30]. However, no evident peak for graphene materials was observed, which may be attributed to the low graphene content of the composite photocatalyst, which resulted in the minimal intensity of diffraction peak. The same phenomenon has also been observed in other studies. For example, Azarang et al. prepared a nitrogen-doped graphene-ZnS composite for hydrogen production, and according their XRD analysis, no apparent graphene diffraction peak could be identified [31]. However, the peaks of CNW-4RGO exhibited a slight shift to a low angle, and the intensity tended to be weaker than that of the CNW. This may be due to the combined interaction(s) between the RGO and CNW, contracting the space between the CNW crystals which cause the slightly decreasing of the crystals size from 10.25 nm (CNW) to 9.87 nm (CNW-4RGO) according to the Scherrer function. Additionally, the interaction may also increase the macroresidual tensile stress on the CNW, leading to regional lattice contraction and hindering the growth of the CNW crystals. Chang Q Sun found that the lattice constant of a crystal was important for determining the intensity of atomic interaction, and the relatively contraction could increase the crystal field [32]. Additionally, the values of lattice constants contract with the decrease of crystals size, which dominating by the surface bond contraction that depends on both the surface-to-volume ratio and the reduced coordination number of surface atoms [32]. In addition, the effect of lattice contraction may be especially significant for particles sizes below 10 nm, but the detailed relationship may be complicated, as suggested by Chang Q Sun [32]. 3.1.3 UV–vis To elucidate the contribution of the RGO content to the band gap structure of the CNWs, the UV–Vis spectra were analyzed to characterize the prepared photocatalysts (Fig. 3 ). Both the CNW and CNW-4RGO photocatalysts exhibited a strong absorption peak in the UV range. Nevertheless, differently from the CNW, the CNW-4RGO composite photocatalyst demonstrated evident absorption in the whole visible-light region due to the presence of RGO. The Tauc function can be used to derive the plots of (αhv)2 against photon energy hv for the CNWs and yield the direct bandgap [33,34]. The calculated bandgap energies of the CNW, CNW-RGO, CNW-4RGO, CNW-8RGO, and CNW-16RGO photocatalysts were 3.35, 3.24, 3.19, 3.08, and 2.97 eV, respectively. Although the changes were slight, which may be due to the slight RGO loading, the results still suggest that a better interaction occurred between the CNWs and the RGO matrix. Furthermore, the effective integration of individual materials could form the CNW-RGO composites. Additionally, with an increase in the RGO content, the photocatalysts exhibited a lower band gap, and that of CNW-16RGO was lowest. Such an enhancement, which may be provided by the large exposed surface of black RGO, can sensitively absorb energy from visible light. However, the efficiency of hydrogen production exhibited the opposite trend. This may be due to the shielding by the black RGO, which hindered light penetration during the reaction, resulting in inefficient hydrogen production [35]. The DFT calculations were also presented to further explain the electron structures. The energy band structures of pure and RGO-doped CNW are shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), and the evaluated bandgap energies were 2.96 and 0.54 eV, respectively. Additionally, the conduction band of the RGO-doped CNW shifted close to the Fermi level, which could increase the stage density to form a more stable system, directly suggesting that the narrowed bandgap may stimulate the reduction of the photo-electron transition energy and extend the absorption edge to the visible light region. According to the results, the bandgap energy can be affected by loading RGO, which corroborates the predictions of the Tauc theory. However, the calculated values were smaller than the experimental values. This may be due to the derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation function from using the GAA calculation function, which can lead to an underestimated bandgap. Additionally, it had no effect on the analysis of the electron structures, which was also mentioned in previous studies [36,37]. The total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of the pure and RGO-doped CNW are shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f). The conduction band of the pure CNW was dominated by Ce 4f and a small number of O 2p states, but the valence band was mainly attributed to O 2p, with a negligible number of Ce 5d and 4f states. The loading of RGO shifted the conduction band lower, as shown in Fig. 3(f), which is also consistent with the conclusion above. Furthermore, the valence band was mainly controlled by O 2p and C 2p, with a small number of Ce 5d Therefore, the composite photocatalysts exhibited a lower bandgap than the CNW, and such a band gap was sufficient for application under solar light. The enhanced light absorption ability of the photocatalysts could not only be utilized in trapping, but it was also beneficial for shifting the electrons in the generation of numerous electron-hole pairs. 3.1.4 FTIR To determine the surface functional groups of the photocatalysts, the FTIR curves of the different photocatalysts (Fig. 4 ) were evaluated. The absorption peak at 3400 and 3450 cm−1 for all catalysts was caused by the O-H stretching vibration, which was attributed to the hydroxyl of the adsorbed water. Additionally, skeletal carbon vibration of the graphene sheets at 1640 cm−1 was observed in the curves of the RGO and CNW-4RGO [38]. The absorption peaks at 1055, 1220, and 1720 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of C–O, C–OH, and C=O, respectively [38]. The intensity of the C-O group in CNW-4RGO was smaller than that in RGO, and the C=O group was almost on-existent. The loss of several oxygen groups after hydrothermal reduction improved the conductivity of the composite photocatalysts. The FTIR spectra of CNW exhibited peak characteristics similar to those reported previously. The peaks at 1355 and 1500 cm−1 indicated the stretching vibration of the Ce–O bond [39–41]. These peaks shifted to 1367 and 1575 cm−1 in the CNW-4RGO, respectively. The band at 890 cm−1 was associated with the Ce-O stretching mode in the face-centered cubic structure, which appeared in the spectra of both CNW and CNW-4RGO. However, the 2350 cm−1 peak disappeared in CNW-4RGO, which may have been due to the uncompensated CO2. Furthermore, a peak near 1480 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of the polydentate carbonate structure, appeared in the CNW-4RGO composites, which may be attributed to the oxidation of the methanol sacrificial agent during the reaction that was attacked by radicals and holes, and decomposed into molecules, as described in Fig. 9. Similar results were also found in other reports [42]. Therefore, the results of FTIR were consistent with those of the XRD."
8,Photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity 3.2.1 Different RGO contents To elucidate the effect of the RGO content, the hydrogen production by CNW-1RGO, CNW-4RGO, CNW-8RGO, and CNW-16RGO photocatalysts with different RGO contents was compared (Fig. 5 ). The hydrogen production by pure CNW and RGO was relatively low. However, for the Ce-doped RGO photocatalyst, the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs likely decreased as the RGO functioned as a trap and acceptor of the electrons produced by the CNW-RGO. Therefore, a number of electrons could be combined with H+ to form hydrogen. As the specific surface area of graphene was high, adding different amounts of RGO increased the surface area of the CNW-RGO photocatalysts and enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen production. The surface areas of the CNW-1RGO, CNW-4RGO, CNW-8RGO, and CNW-16RGO photocatalysts were 32.48, 52.26, 48.75, and 42.19 m2 g−1, respectively (Table 1 ). Among the four photocatalysts, the surface area of CNW-4RGO was largest. As the RGO loading increased, the surface area of the composite photocatalysts decreased due to the agglomeration and stacking of the graphene sheets. Similar results were observed in several previous studies [43,44]. Furthermore, as the RGO content increased, the trend of the change in photocatalytic activity was similar, and in parallel. The large surface area of the CNW-4RGO photocatalyst resulted in highly efficient photocatalytic reactive centers and active adsorption sites, directly enhancing the photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production. During the photoreaction process, the transfer distance for electron migration before recombination could be shortened due to a large surface area and high surface-to-volume ratio [45]. This result was also confirmed by the XRD analysis (i.e., lattice contraction affected the surface-to-volume ratio). Thus, the optimal loading amount of RGO for the CNW-RGO photocatalysts was 4 wt.%, and the highest hydrogen production rate achieved was 7.14 mmol g−1. The issue of the stacking of RGO nanosheets may have been caused by the excess RGO, which likely suppressed light absorption as it increased photon scattering. The effective reaction area between the sacrificial agents and photocatalysts may have also decreased, potentially reducing the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production. As shown in previous literature reporting the performances of CNW-RGO and other graphene or CeO2-based photocatalysts (Table 2 ) [46–54], the CNW-RGO photocatalyst in this study could exhibit relatively good properties. To further study the efficiency of the photocatalyst, the TOF was also evaluated, which quantifies the specific catalytic activity under defined reaction conditions by evaluating the number of molecular reactions occurring at the center per unit time. According to Eq. (1), the TOF is the total number of moles transformed on the catalyst`s surface by one mole of active sites per hour [55,56]. (1) TOF [ h − 1 ] = m o l p r o d u c t m o l r e a c t i o n . t i m e = m o l H 2 m o l C e . h The TOF can also be used to compare the functioning of the active surface sites for catalytic activity in different catalytic systems. The TOF results directly reflect the catalytic activity per unit time. The responding catalytic activity profiles were consistent with the TOF results. A large TOF corresponds to high catalytic activity [55,56]. Therefore, to study the efficiency of CNW-RGO as a photocatalyst for hydrogen production by water decomposition, the TOF was calculated (Fig. 6 ). The relationship between the corresponding TOF of the CNW-RGO-based photocatalysts and hydrogen production rate was uniform. Without CNW loading, the photocatalytic activity of pure RGO for hydrogen production was almost negligible. However, CNW-4RGO exhibited the fastest hydrogen production rate of 1.785 mmol h−1 g−1, suggesting that the highest photocatalytic activity and TOF value were achieved when the amount of RGO loaded on the catalyst was 4 wt.%. This was larger than the previously reported values, as shown in Table 3 [57–60]. The composite photocatalysts loaded with 8 wt.% of RGO exhibited a relatively high TOF. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production acquired by loading 1 wt.% and 16 wt.% of RGO was weak, indicating the low utilization efficiency of RGO in the CNW-1RGO and CNW-16RGO samples, respectively. This result was consistent with the RGO content (Fig. 5). Hence, CNW-4RGO was regarded as the most appropriate photocatalytic material for hydrogen production. 3.2.2 Different sacrificial agents For sustainable application, different types of organic matter could be used as sacrificial agents in chemical reactions for photocatalytic hydrogen production [61]. Organic compounds are typically selected as sacrificial agents for the following reasons: (1) they can exhibit the highest performance efficiency during hydrogen production and act as partial electron donors when they are oxidized; (2) they could prevent the reverse reaction from occurring, consume photogenerated holes and reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs on the surface of the photocatalysts; and (3) they can easily be obtained from biomass production or industrial wastewater and waste material for renewable hydrogen production [62]. The efficiency of different organic compounds varies, as the structural and polarization characteristics of organic matter are strongly affected by the presence of hydrogen bonds in the liquid phase. Additionally, the quantitative importance of polarization influences the reaction processes (such as chemical reactions, electron transition, or molecular recognition), as energy changes are associated with the electron correlation of polarization [63]. Fig. 7 (a) shows the effects of the different monohydric and polyphyletic alcohol sacrificial agents (i.e., CH3OH, propanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, ethanol, and 1,2-propanediol) on the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production with CNW-4RGO. The highest and lowest hydrogen production rates were achieved with CH3OH and propanol as the sacrificial agents, respectively. The hydrogen production rates with monohydric and polyphyletic alcohols decreased in the following order: methanol > ethanol > propanol, glycerol > ethylene glycol > 1,2-propanediol. The hydrogen production rate with polyphyletic alcohols was slightly higher than that with monohydric alcohols, suggesting that it was affected by the number of hydroxyl groups in the alcohols. This was also consistent with the results presented in Fig. 7(b), which shows that hydrogen production increased as the initial methanol concentration increased from 5 to 40 vol%. CNW-4RGO exhibited the highest hydrogen production rate at a methanol concentration of 40 vol%. At a low initial concentration, the photogenerated oxides on the surfaces of the photocatalysts could not be eliminated, resulting in a rapid decrease in hydrogen production. Similar results were also achieved when using methanol used as the sacrificial agent for hydrogen production [64]. The polarity of these alcohols is also discussed here based on Eq. (2) [64,65], and the polarity of monohydric and polyphyletic alcohols is plotted against the hydrogen production rate in Fig. 8 . (2) Y = ε S − 1 ε S + 2 where Y is the polarity, and εS is the relative solvent permittivity. As shown in Fig. 8, the hydrogen production rate exhibited a positive correlation with the alcohol polarity. Consequently, as the number of hydroxyl groups increased, the hydrogen production rate also increased. Both monohydric and polyphyletic alcohols exhibited the same tendencies, which agreed with the results of a previous study [66]. Therefore, methanol was chosen as the sacrificial agent in this study due to its relatively simple structure and species generated during the process, which could be well used to explain the reaction mechanism that discussed in the next section. 3.2.3 Photocatalytic mechanism Here, the charge transfer pathway is proposed, as the electronic structure and energy level of the photocatalysts were critical for the redox reactions during water splitting. The well-interconnected sheet produced by RGO loading could potentially derive reactive species along the desired path, thereby facilitating reactant diffusion and charge transport. Therefore, XPS analysis was conducted before and after the photocatalytic reaction to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Fig. 9 (a) presents the full spectrum, which indicated the presence of Ce, C, and O in the as-prepared sample based on the characteristic peaks of these elements. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the peaks at 884.2, 885.0, 890.0, and 899.2 eV were attributed to the spin orbital splitting of Ce 3d5/2, while 900.3, 902.8, 909.1, and 918.5 eV were attributed to the spin orbital splitting of Ce 3d3/2 [67]. Furthermore, the six peaks at binding energies of V, V``, V```, U, U``, and U``` were attributed to Ce4+, and the peaks at V` and U` were attributed to Ce3+ [68,69]. This indicates that the Ce3+ and Ce4+coexisted in the as-prepared photocatalysts, which could accelerate the migration and transformation of the oxygen radical on the surface of the photocatalysts and enhance the redox reaction. Additionally, the binding energy increased slightly after the reaction, which could be attributed to the decreased electron density and change in the chemical displacement of Ce 3d Meanwhile, the lost electrons were transferred to the surface of the RGO lamella and reacted with the adsorbed protons to form hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 9(c), the binding energy of O 1 s decreased slightly after the reaction, exhibiting the opposite tendency to Ce 3d Additionally, the peaks at 529.0, 530.0, and 531.0 eV were attributed to the different chemical states of O in CNW-4RGO, which corresponded to the lattice, hydroxyl, and surface-adsorbed oxygen, respectively [70,71]. Fig. 9(d) presents the high-resolution spectra of C 1 s. As shown, the peaks at 284.2, 284.9, 285.7, and 288.6 eV after the reaction could be assigned to C 1 s, and were attributed to the C-C/C=C in the aromatic rings, C-O of the epoxy and alkoxy groups, C=O, and O-C=O bonds, respectively [72]. The change in the binding energy followed the same trend as that of O 1 s, indicating that the RGO acted as the electron receiver. To further explore these observations, the reaction mechanism of the hydrogen production photocatalytic reaction was proposed and is shown in Fig. 9(e). The relative band location that exhibited the electron transfer pathway during the reaction is also presented. The CNW-RGO photocatalysts were suitable for hydrogen production as the conduction band was more negative than the redox potential of H+ to H2, which enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. When the CNW- RGO was subjected to light irradiation, electrons were stimulated from the valance band to the conduction band, and then transferred to the RGO nanosheets. The adsorbed protons then reacted with the electrons to form H2. The RGO nanosheets can serve as electron capture traps to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs due to the large reaction space and the rapid electron transfer rate, which is the same conclusion as that of the XPS analysis. Additionally, methanol, which was oxidized and consumed during the reaction, also enhanced the overall hydrogen production rate. First, methanol adsorbed on the CNW-RGO forming methoxy groups that could capture the photogenerated holes to further form methoxy radicals [73]. The methanol may have also directly reacted with the holes to form methoxy radicals [74]. The methoxy radicals then continue to capture the holes and release protons, thereby transforming into formaldehyde. The generated formaldehyde could then be further oxidized by the photogenerated holes and hydroxyl radicals to formic acid, which was finally transformed into carbonate or CO2. Throughout the photocatalytic reactions, methanol and its derived species were more effectively oxidized by the holes than the surface hydroxyls that could release protons (Ha +) stepwise [73,75]. Additionally, according to Chen et al., the water species could receive the Ha +from methanol to form H2HaO+, which could quickly exchange the protons with other H2O to form H3O+ and then be transferred to the surface of the active sites to form hydrogen. The methanol also could divert the protons through a similar mechanism. However, the proton-transfer speed of methanol was slower than that mediated by water under the same conditions [73]. Therefore, most of the protons reacting with electrons to generate hydrogen originated from the water, rather than methanol. By doping the materials with RGO, reduction and oxidation sites were more formed in the modified CNW-RGO photocatalysts and markedly improved the hydrogen production efficiency. The FTIR spectra captured after the reaction were also analyzed, as shown in Fig. 9(f), to further confirm the conclusions drawn above. The special peak at 1053 cm−1, which appeared in CNW-4RGO after four hours of reaction, was attributed to the formation of the methoxy group. The presence of CH3O−not only confirmed the adsorption of methanol on the surface of the catalysts, but also verified the oxidation of methanol [76,77]. Based on the above, the process could be described as follows [73,74,78–80]: Valence band: (3) C H 3 OH + h + → C H 3 O + H + (4) C H 3 O + h + → C H 2 O + H + (5) C H 2 O + OH + h + → HCOOH + H + (6) HCOOH + 2 h + → C O 2 / Carbonate + 2 H + Conduction band: (7) 2 e − + 2 H + → H 2 Overall: (8) C H 3 OH + H 2 O → C O 2 / Carbonate + 3 H 2 3.2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production stability assessment To determine the photochemical stability and reproducibility of the photocatalysts, the experiment was repeated and investigated again (Fig. 10 (a)). The photocatalysts were washed and dried after irradiation for 4 h for reuse. The methanol was added when the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction was repeated. According to the results, the replicated H2 evolution study also exhibited promising photochemical stability. After four cycles, 93.3% of the photocatalytic activity of the CNW-4RGO photocatalyst was maintained. The slight decrease in the photocatalytic activity may be attributed to the photocorrosion caused by the presence of CNWs on the composite. Consequently, photo-deactivation and a slight decline in the dissolution on the surface of the RGO were observed over time. The results were consistent with the photoelectrochemical experiments, which were conducted to further explore the stability and activity of the CNW-RGO-based photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 10(b), the transient photocurrent responses of the CNW and CNW-4RGO photocatalysts were tested to assess the charge transfer properties. when the light was shut off every 50 s, photocurrents were not clearly observed. However, quick and reproducible photocurrent responses occurred when the light was on for both the CNW and CNW-4RGO photocatalysts. This experimental phenomenon was observed over three on-off cycles. When light is shined on the photocatalyst, excitons are generated. If the excitons live long enough, they can be separated and minority carriers are transferred to solution or trapped at the surface, while majority carriers -in this case electrons- are collected, and contribute to photocurrent. Recombination limits the photocurrent, and determines the rapid decay of the current when the irradiation is interrupted. After loading the CNW with RGO, the photocurrent intensity increased and reached its maximum value sooner, and attenuation was not conspicuous when compared to the CNW. Therefore, the results clearly suggested that the CNW-4RGO photocatalyst can effectively promote the electron migration and separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs as mentioned above, due to the addition of RGO, which can increase the stability and reusability for practical application."
9,Conclusion,"In this study, CNW-RGOs were successfully prepared by a simple hydrothermal synthesis method. The CNW-RGO photocatalyst significantly improved the hydrogen production performance of water splitting. The morphological and structural analyses revealed that the CNWs contained uniform wires with an average diameter of 22 nm. The composite photocatalyst exhibited a promising absorption in the visible light range, which was consistent with the DFT calculation. The highest hydrogen production rate (7.14 mmol g −1) and TOF were achieved at a RGO content of 4 wt.%. The hydrogen production rate increased with an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups. CH3OH was the most promising sacrificial agent, and the presence of CH3O− can be used to verify the mechanism of the reaction. After four cycles, the photocatalytic activity exhibited high stability and promising reusability, which was also demonstrated by the transient photocurrent responses. The improved hydrogen production activity of the CNW-RGO system was due to the reduced bandgap, efficient charge separation, and enhanced light absorption. This study provides a significant reference for maximizing the predominant properties of graphene and Ce as efficient photocatalysts."
