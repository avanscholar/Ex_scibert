0,Introduction,"Human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (hGCSF) is a hematopoietic cytokine that acts on cells of the neutrophil lineage causing proliferation and differentiation of committed precursor cells and activation of mature neutrophils [1]. Due to its low molecular weight (18.8 kDa), hGCSF was quickly cleared from the plasma, with an extremely short half-life (t 1/2) of 4–8 h [2]. To solve these problems, a constitutive expression vector for human serum albumin-human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (HSA-GCSFm) fusion protein production in recombinant Pichia. pastoris was constructed in our previous study and exhibited comparative biological activity and prolonged half-life in vivo [3]. However, the processes optimization for HSA-GCSFm fusion protein production have seldom been reported in the related literatures. Compared with other eukaryotic systems, the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris is an ideal and versatile host for heterologous proteins production [4–6], which features with easy genetic manipulation, the potential of growing cells to extremely high densities, posttranslational modifications with high similarity to mammalian cells, and the excellent nature of secreting heterologous proteins into fermentation broth for easy targeted product purification. In general, heterologous proteins production in recombinant P. pastoris fed-batch fermentation could be divided into two successive phases: 1) a cell growth phase to achieve high cell density culture in a short time using glycerol as the sole carbon source; 2) a methanol induction phase by feeding methanol to induce the targeted recombinant proteins expression [4,7]. It was well known that the time length of methanol induction phase is generally much longer than that of cell growth phase (20–30 h vs 70–90 h) [8,9]. As a result, development of an adequate methanol feeding strategy was considered as one of the most important issues for improving heterogeneous proteins production. A great deal of methanol feeding strategies have been proposed and carried out for the efficient expression of heterologous proteins, such as constant methanol feeding [10], exponential methanol feeding [11,12], methanol ON-OFF feeding [13] and DO-stat methanol feeding [14,15], etc. Among all these methanol feeding strategies mentioned above, the on-line DO-stat and methanol ON-OFF feedback control strategies were always regarded to be superior to other the feed-forward control strategies, since it has the ability to deal with dynamic changes during the process of methanol feeding [16,17]. However, the traditional DO-stat feeding strategy controls substrate feeding by on-line measuring DO and determines the substrate feeding amount by and only by severe continuous oscillations in DO, which always results in carbon source (methanol) insufficiency [4,16]. More concretely, methanol requirement amount of P. pastoris cells exceeds the methanol feeding amount when using DO-stat feeding strategy, which means that methanol consumption amount is limited. On the other hand, when initiating methanol induction at extremely high cell density (80–120 g-DCW/L), if methanol concentration is controlled at sufficient level (5–10 g/L) by ON-OFF control mode, the very high oxygen consuming feature of P. pastoris cells would drop DO to almost zero level immediately after initiating methanol induction [9,10,16]. Fig. 1 showed the simplified metabolic map for methanol metabolism by P. pastoris. As shown in Fig. 1, oxygen could be used for the cell respiration and the first methanol oxidation reaction (CH3OH+O2→HCHO+H2O2). This methanol oxidation reaction, catalyzed by the alcohol oxidase (AOX) enzyme, generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that can also be used by AOX for methanol oxidation. Therefore, two potentially toxic metabolites could be generated in the P. pastoris cells when implementing the first methanol oxidation [18–20]. Of these components， formaldehyde would be expected to accumulate in the P. pastoris cells with detrimental effect when the P. pastoris cells were subjected to the environment of oxygen limitation for long time. As a result, cells physiological states both in excess (methanol ON-OFF control) and in scarcity (traditional DO-stat control) of methanol must be considered and managed. In this study, we developed a novel on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes by controlling the oscillation bandwidths of DO at a narrower and stable level and applied it for HSA-GCSFm fusion protein production by methanol utilization plus phenotype (Mut+) P. pastoris, attempting to enhance methanol consumption rate and heterogeneous proteins expression. The analysis results would also supply some valuable information on process control of other heterogeneous protein productions by recombinant P. pastoris."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All buffers and culture media (unless otherwise specified) were prepared with analytical grade chemicals purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China)."
3,Strains,"2.2 Strains P. pastoris GS115, a Mut+ strain, was used as a host strain for expression of HSA-hGCSFm fusion gene under the control of inducible AOX1 promoter [3]. In brief, the targeted gene was recovered with EcoRⅠ and NotⅠ (Huamei Biotech Co. China) from the recombinant plasmid (pBlu2KSP-HSA-hGCSFm) and inserted into pPIC9k (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to construct expression plasmid pPIC9k-HSA-hGCSFm (Fig. S1). The recombinant plasmids (pBlu2KSP-HSA-hGCSFm & pPIC9k-HSA-hGCSFm) were constructed using the same methods as described in the reported [21]. The construction of the recombinant P. pastoris strain was carried out at School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China."

The medium for batch fermentation: glycerol 20, (NH4)2SO4 5, H3PO4 2 (%, v/v), MgSO4 1, CaSO4 0.1, K2SO4 1, PTM1 [4] 10 (mL/L), pH 6.0.

5,Cell cultivation and HSA-GCSFm fusion protein induction strategies,"2.4 Cell cultivation and HSA-GCSFm fusion protein induction strategies The fermentation cultivation for HSA-GCSFm fusion protein production by Mut+ P. pastoris was carried out in a 5 L fermentor (BIOTECH-5BG, Baoxing Bio Co., China). The first step of glycerol batch phase was carried out at 30 °C and pH was controlled around 6.0 by adding 5% (v/v) ammonia solution. The volumes of batch medium were about 2.3 L. Inoculation and aeration rate were at 15% (v/v) and 4 vvm. During the glycerol batch phase, DO was maintained above 20% by manually increasing agitation rate until 700 rpm. When the initial glycerol in batch phase was completely consumed and DO sharply rose up at about 12 h, the traditional DO-stat control strategy was used for feeding glycerol during the glycerol feeding phase. The time length of glycerol feeding was continued for 10–12 h. At about 22–24 h, the cell growth was switched into methanol adaptation phase by co-feeding glycerol and methanol mixture (glycerol/methanol: 20/1, v/v). The time length of this phase continued for 4–5 h to allow cells gradually adapt to methanol. After the methanol adaptation phase finished (dry cell weight-DCW reaching about 80–90 g-DCW/L) and the residual glycerol was completely consumed, the methanol induction phase was initiated by feeding methanol. With help of methanol induction strategies I (methanol ON-OFF control), II (traditional DO-stat control) or III (on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes), to be described below, the methanol feeding rate was automatically regulated by a programmable peristaltic pump (BT00-100M, Langer Co., China). Air or pure oxygen was used for aeration according to requirements, the temperature and pH remained unchanged throughout the entire fermentation process. Induction strategy I (methanol ON-OFF control): based on the on-line measurement values of methanol electrode (FC-2002, Subo Co., China), methanol concentration was controlled at 5–10 g/L by adjusting methanol feeding via ON-OFF control strategy. Induction strategy II (the traditional DO-stat control): when DO rose above its upper limit (20%), the methanol feeding medium starts to be fed. By activation of the metabolic pathway, DO tension falls to the set value, at which the feeding is stopped. Induction strategy III (on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes): with help of the exponential and DO-stat control strategy, DO was controlled at 20% by limiting methanol feeding as following equation: (1) F M e O H = F M e O H * + K C ( D O − D O s e t ) , F M e O H ≥ 0 g / h F M e O H * = μ s e t Y X / S X t 0 V t 0 e μ s e t ( t f − t 0 ) Here, F MeOH represented the real methanol feeding rate (g/h), F*MeOH the standard methanol feeding rate (g/h), K C the proportional gain (g/h), DO set the set/desired DO level (-), Y X/S the cell yields on methanol (-), μ set the set specific cell growth rate (1/h), X the cell concentration (g/L), V the volume of fermentation broth (L), t 0 the time instant when the methanol induction phase started (h) and t f the time instant when the methanol induction phase ended (h). In this study, the values of DO set, μ set, Y X/S , X t0 and V t0 were about 20%, 0.03 1/h, 0.37, 80.0 g/L and 3.0 L respectively. As an empirical adjusting parameter, the value of K C was empirically determined as 0.06 by considering both the variations of F* MeOH and upper/lower limits of DO during the methanol feeding phase. More concretely, K C was changed in a manner of “trial and error” at a mass of control instants to evaluate the real DO control performance when implementing the run using the modified DO-stat control strategy. Finally, selecting the value of K C at 0.06 were desirable and sub-optimal via the real time control testing."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The turbidity of P. pastoris cells was measured with a spectrophotometer at 600 nm (OD600) and then dry cell weight (DCW) were determined by the following consistent calibration curve: g-DCW/L= 0.25 ×OD600. Exogenous and intracellular methanol concentration was determined using a gas chromatography (GC112A, FID detector, Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co., China) equipped with an AlphaCol AC20 capillary column (SGE Int’l Pty. Ltd., Australia). Intracellular formaldehyde concentration was measured by the HPLC (Agilent 1100) at 254 nm using an UV detector and a reverse-phase ZORBAX SBAqC18 column [22]. Measurement of cell viability was performed by the flow cytometry as described in the previous reports [23]. HSA-GCSFm concentration was measured by the kit of trace urinary albumin (MinDian Co., Shanghai) as described by Guan et al. [24]. The SDS-PAGE analysis of HSA-GCSFm was performed by the same methods as described in our previous work [9]. The activities of three different key enzymes (alcohol oxidase-AOX, formaldehyde dehydrogenase-FLD and formate dehydrogenase-FDH) involved in methanol metabolism were measured using the same methods reported in our previous work [22]."
7,Results,
8,Repressing intracellular methanol accumulation by traditional DO-stat methanol feeding strategy,"3.1 Repressing intracellular methanol accumulation by traditional DO-stat methanol feeding strategy In heterologous proteins production by highly aerobic P. pastoris cells, it is unrealistic to control concentrations of methanol and DO at their sufficient levels simultaneously when initiating methanol induction at very high cell density (80–100 g-DCW/L) under the traditional condition of air-aeration. As a result, the environments of “methanol sufficient-oxygen limited” and “methanol limited-oxygen sufficient” were two realistic induction strategies. The optimal methanol concentrations are commonly in the range of 1–30 g/L when adopting traditional methanol induction strategy [16]. It was widely reported that heterologous proteins could be effectively expressed when methanol concentration was higher than 5 g/L [25,26]. Therefore, in this study, the condition with methanol concentration at 5–10 g/L was considered as the environment of “methanol sufficient”. On the hand, a great deal of researchers also indicated that when using online DO measurement and control modes, controlling DO above 5–10% was beneficial for effective expression of heterologous proteins by P. pastoris [10,27,28]. Therefore, in this study, the condition with DO above 5–10% was categorized to the environment of “oxygen sufficient”. The environment of “methanol sufficient-oxygen limited” creating by methanol ON-OFF control strategy (strategy I) was firstly applied for effective production of HSA-GCSFm in P. pastoris fed-batch fermentation. As shown in Fig. 2a, when controlling methanol concentration at sufficient levels (5–10 g/L), the highly aerobic P. pastoris cells would immediately reduce DO to zero level (0%) after initiating methanol induction. In this case, severe intracellular methanol accumulation occurred since the primary methanol oxidation reaction (CH3OH + O2→HCHO + H2O2) could not efficiently carry out due to oxygen supplement limitation (Fig. 2c). As a result, P. pastoris cells gradually lost the ability to grow and synthesis HSA-GCSFm with more and more methanol accumulation in cells, maximal concentrations of cells and HSA-GCSFm finished at a very low level of 88.25 g-DCW/L and 0.13 g/L, respectively (Fig. 2e). There would be some doubt regarding on a decline in cells concentration when using methanol ON-OFF control mode (Fig. 2e), since in many literatures [29,30], cell concentration increases with induction time. The reasons could be interpreted as follows: 1) intracellular toxic methanol accumulated with detrimental effect when the cells were subjected to the environment of “methanol sufficient-oxygen limitation” for long time (Fig. 2c); 2) the extremely low specific consumption rates of methanol (q MeOH) and oxygen cannot stratify the lowest requirement for cell growth; 3) it was widely reported that in heterologous proteins production by P. pastoris, methanol induction was generally initiated after cell concentration reached a relatively low level of 10–30 g-DCW/L [29,30]. Under this condition, cell concentration would increase with induction time. However, some researchers also reported that cell concentration would decline in the induction phase, when methanol induction was initiated at a very high density of 80–120 g-DCW/L [22,31]. In this study, methanol induction was initiated when cell concentration reached at ~100 g-DCW/L (Fig. 2e). This could be considered as a major reason responsible for a significant decline in cells concentration when using the methanol ON-OFF control mode. Another realistic induction environment of “methanol limited-oxygen sufficient” creating by the traditional DO-stat control strategy (II) was also carried out by maintaining DO at sufficient and desired levels (0–60%) via limiting methanol feeing (controlling methanol concentration at almost zero level) (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2d & 2 f, there was no any accumulation of intracellular methanol and thus maximal concentrations of cell and HSA-GCSFm finished at higher levels of 110.52 g-DCW/L and 0.30 g/L, respectively."
9,Effective production of HSA-GCSFm by the on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes,"3.2 Effective production of HSA-GCSFm by the on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes It was very known that the traditional DO-stat feeding strategy determines the substrate (methanol) feeding amount by and only by severe continuous oscillations in DO, which always results in substrate insufficiency for effective heterogeneous protein production [4,16]. During the methanol induction phase, methanol works as the sole carbon source, energy supplier and inducer for heterologous protein production by P. pastoris when using methanol-only induction [15,32]. As a result, controlling methanol consumption rate at high levels using proper methanol feeding strategy was very crucial for effective production of HSA-GCSFm. Aiming to improve of methanol consumption/feeding rate for effective HSA-GCSFm production during the methanol induction phase, an on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes (strategy III) was proposed and carried out in this study. As shown in Fig. 3a, when using this strategy, the oscillation bandwidths of DO was controlled at a narrower and stable level (~20%) and thus q MeOH was clearly enhanced (Fig. 3b). As a result, when using induction strategy III, concentrations of cell and HSA-GCSFm reached the highest levels of 138.52 g-DCW/L and 0.44 g/L, respectively (Fig. 3c). In addition, above results was further confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, the HSA-GCSFm fusion protein bands (84.0 kDa) obtained using strategy III were much intensive than those of the other two cases (strategy I & II)."
10,Metabolic interpretations of enhancing HSA-GCSFm production by the on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes,"3.3 Metabolic interpretations of enhancing HSA-GCSFm production by the on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes 3.3.1 Reducing maintenance coefficient and cell mortality by the on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes In heterologous proteins production by P. pastoris fed-batch fermentation using methanol as sole carbon source, the distribution of methanol could be generally divided into two portions: cells growth/targeted recombinant proteins synthesis and cells maintenance [33]. By depicting q MeOH versus specific cell growth rate (μ), maintenance coefficient (m) when using the three different induction strategies could be calculated by following well-recognized equation [13,34]: (2) q M e O H = 1 Y X / S μ + m As shown in Fig. 5b, to maintain cellular homeostasis when cells were exposed to the environment of severe continuous oscillations in DO for long time, the distribution of methanol to cells maintenance reached the highest level of 0.0195 g-MeOH/g-DCW/h using strategy II. On the contrary, when controlling the oscillation bandwidths of DO at a narrow and stable level (Fig. 3a) using strategy III, maintenance coefficient was maintained at the lowest level of 0.0126 g-MeOH/g-DCW/h (Fig. 5b). These results implied that much higher q MeOH and the lowest methanol distribution ratio to cells maintenance was simultaneously achieved when using strategy III. In this case, the methanol distribution ratio to cells growth/targeted recombinant proteins synthesis was obviously enhanced and thus HSA-GCSFm concentration reached the highest levels of 0.44 g/L (Fig. 3c). Besides the maintenance coefficient, cell mortality was another important issue for the heterologous proteins production by P. pastoris. When implementing the environment of “methanol limited-oxygen sufficient” creating by either tractional (II) or modified (III) DO-stat control strategy, severe intracellular toxic methanol accumulation could be effectively controlled at almost zero level. As a result, at the end of the methanol induction phase, the cell mortalities when using strategy II & III were maintained at very low level of 12.92–17.88%. On the contrary, when using strategy I, with more and more toxic methanol accumulated inside P. pastoris cells, the mortality rate of P. pastoris cells reached the highest level of 27.84%. This further explains why maximal HSA-GCSFm concentration were increased 1.47–3.38-fold compared to the control. 3.3.2 Enhancing P. pastoris cells metabolic activities and repressing the accumulation of toxic formaldehyde by the on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes The major chemical reactions in methanol metabolism and relevant key enzymes including alcohol oxidase (AOX), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FLD) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) involved have been widely reported previously [35] and summarized in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, it was well known that AOX is the first key enzyme for mediating methanol metabolism (CH3OH + O2→HCHO + H2O2) and targeted proteins synthesis and its activities directly related with methanol consumption rate, P. pastoris cells metabolic activity, and HSA-GCSFm concentration. As shown in Fig. 6a, when using strategy III, AOX activity reached the highest levels among the three different induction strategies. In this case, the highest AOX activity could consume the fed methanol completely. On the contrary, when using strategy I (methanol sufficient-oxygen limited), exogenous methanol concentration was controlled at high/sufficient levels (Fig. 2a), exogenous methanol could rapidly diffused into the cells and gradually accumulated inside cells (0.016 g-MeOH/g-DCW, Fig. 2c) since methanol oxidation reaction catalyzed by AOX cannot efficiently implement due to the very low AOX activity (Fig. 6a) and oxygen limitation (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, FLD and FDH contribute to NADH and ATP regeneration ability in the formaldehyde dissimilation pathway, if the activities of FLD and FDH were maintained at high levels, the toxic intermediate metabolites such as formaldehyde and formate were oxidized into carbon dioxide (CO2) completely [13]. As shown in Fig. 6b & 6c, when using strategy III, the activities of FLD and FDH reached the highest levels among the three different induction strategies and thus the accumulations of formaldehyde and formate were strictly restricted at almost zero level throughout the entire methanol induction phase. On the contrary, with the extremely low activities of FLD and FDH, intracellular toxic intermediate metabolites (formaldehyde) severely accumulated when using strategy I, which eventually leading to a failure of HSA-GCSFm expression."
11,Discussion,"It was well known that the methanol induction strategies with concentrations of methanol and DO as the operating parameters could be divided into following 4 combinations: “methanol sufficient-oxygen sufficient”, “methanol limited-oxygen sufficient”, “methanol sufficient-oxygen limited” and “methanol limited-oxygen limited”. The strategy of “methanol sufficient-oxygen sufficient” almost cannot be realized under the ordinary air-aeration condition due to the following reasons: 1) methanol induction was generally initiated at very high P. pastoris cells density (80–120 g-DCW/L). Oxygen consumption couples with methanol consumption throughout the entire methanol induction phase. This means that, oxygen consumption rate must match up with that of methanol. Our previous reports demonstrated that when initiating methanol induction at extremely high cell density (80–120 g-DCW/L), if methanol concentration is controlled at sufficient level (5–10 g/L), the very high oxygen consuming feature of P. pastoris cells would drop DO to almost zero level immediately after initiating methanol induction. [9,10]. To control DO at sufficient levels (20%) could only be realistic by controlling methanol concentration at near zero level (0–1 g/L) via limiting methanol feeding. These results could also demonstrate that when using the strategy III, the exogenous methanol concentrations were still maintained at 0–1 g/L, which were very similar to that using the strategy II; 2) the environment of “methanol sufficient-oxygen sufficient” could be realized when aerating pure oxygen. However, since high sensitivity of DO in response to aeration and agitation changes under pure oxygen aeration condition, severe fluctuation of DO would occur, which eventually deteriorated the expression of heterologous proteins [27,36] On the other hand, the “methanol limited-oxygen limited” combination is not obviously benificial for expression of heterologous proteins. Therefore, the environments of “methanol sufficient-oxygen limited” and “methanol sufficient-oxygen limited” seem to the only realistic induction strategies. In this study, the effects of the two realistic environments of “methanol sufficient-oxygen limited” creating by methanol ON-OFF control strategy and “methanol limited-oxygen sufficient” creating by either traditional or modified DO-stat control strategy on cell physiology and the heterologous proteins yields were systematically analyzed. It was widely reported that intracellular toxic methanol and formaldehyde could be expected to accumulate in the P. pastoris cells with detrimental effect when the cells were subjected to the environment of “methanol sufficient-oxygen limitation” for long time, which eventually leading to a failure of heterologous proteins production [9,16]. In this study, when implementing the “methanol sufficient-oxygen limited” creating by methanol ON-OFF strategy was somewhat similar to the previously reported [9,16]. More concretely, with more and more toxic methanol and formaldehyde accumulated inside P. pastoris cells, when implementing the environment of “methanol sufficient-oxygen limitation” creating by ON-OFF control mode: 1) the cell metabolic activities reflected by the activities of three key enzymes (AOX, FLD and FDH) in methanol metabolism were maintained at the lowest level among the three different induction strategies (Fig. 6); 2) the mortality rate of cells reached the highest level of 27.84% (Fig. 5c) and cells gradually loses the ability to metabolize methanol and synthesize heterologous proteins, leading to a failure of HSA-GCSFm expression (Fig. 2c and e). On the other hand, when implementing the environment of “methanol limited-oxygen sufficient” creating by the traditional DO-stat induction strategy, the accumulations of intracellular toxic methanol and formaldehyde were strictly maintained at almost zero level (Figs. 2d and 6 d), and thus the activities of three key enzymes in methanol metabolism, q MeOH and cell viability could be apparently enhanced (Figs. 2d , 5c and 6). As a result, maximal HSA-GCSFm concentration reached at higher levels of 0.30 g/L using the traditional DO-stat control strategy, which was about 130% higher than that achieved using methanol ON-OFF control strategy (Fig. 2). However, HSA-GCSFm production by P. pastoris with the environment of “methanol limited-oxygen sufficient” creating by the traditional DO-stat induction strategy (II) used directly without further modification suffered with following problems: 1) DO-stat strategy controls methanol feeding by on-line measuring DO and determines its feeding amount only by the severe continuous oscillations in DO, which always results in a limited methanol feeding/consumption rate [4,16]; 2) the distribution of methanol towards to cells maintenance have to be increased to maintain cellular homeostasis when cells were exposed to the environment of severe continuous oscillations in DO for long time, since the severe continuous oscillations in DO even deteriorated the target protein expression [27,36]. Some reports described that adjusting methanol feeding by the exponential or constant methanol feeding strategy is an alternative method to enhance methanol induction strength by increasing methanol feeding/consumption rate, and thus effective production of heterologous proteins in Pichia pastoris fed-batch fermentation could be expected [15,17,37]. However, from the view of bioprocess control, as a typical feed-forward control strategy, the exponential and constant methanol feeding strategy is inadequate for dealing with the complex and a highly nonlinear dynamic changes during the methanol feeding process, lead to an excessive accumulation of methanol which could inhibit cell growth, trigger the formation of toxic metabolites in turn [16,17]. To maximize increase q MeOH and HSA-GCSFm expression, the environment of “methanol limited-DO sufficient” creating by a novel on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes via controlling the oscillation bandwidths of DO at a narrower/stable level (~20%) was proposed in this study. In this case, the activities of three key enzymes in methanol metabolism, q MeOH and cell viability could be maintained the highest levels among the three different induction strategies (Fig. 3b, 5c and 6), and thus HSA-GCSFm concentration reached the highest level of 0.44 g/L, which was about 46%−238% increase than that obtained using the other two control strategies (Fig. 3c). In addition, the results of current result were also compared with other similar studies in Table 1 [38–42]. As shown in Table 1, when using the on-line model-based exponential and DO-stat control modes, HSA-GCSFm concentration reached the highest level of 0.44 g/L among the eight (8) runs. Thus, the proposed induction strategy could be considered as an effective approach for improving HSA-GCSFm fermentation performance. There would be some doubt that the ratio of specific activities of 3 key enzymes in methanol metabolism does not change during the induction phase, since the physiological conditions in which the cells are located might have been changed with increasing induction time. The reasons could be explained as follows: as the first reaction step in methanol utilization metabolism in P. pastoris, the expression of the AOX gene including AOX1, AOX2 in the peroxisome depends on the fluxes of methanol and oxygen molecules in the presence of a cofactor, FAD, and generates formaldehyde and H2O2 as products (Fig. 1). As a result, to adapt to the environment of methanol feeding, the activity of AOX gradually increased with induction time and eventually reached the highest level at almost 20–45 h when using the three different induction strategies (Fig. 6). These similar conclusions could be found in a couple of related reports [43,44]. After that, when using the methanol ON-OFF control strategy, with more and more toxic methanol and formaldehyde accumulated inside cells (Figs. 2c and 6d), the activity of AOX obviously decreased during 40–70 h of induction phase. On the other hand, when using on-line DO measurement and control mode (traditional or modified DO-stat), the activities of AOX could be maintained at relatively stable range during 30–70 h of induction phase due to the following two reasons: 1) when using on-line DO measurement and control modes, the accumulations of intracellular toxic methanol and formaldehyde were strictly maintained at almost zero level (Figs. 2d, 3b and 6d). Under these desired conditions, the activities of AOX could be maintained at relatively stable range; 2) some researchers [23,45] also indicated that the activity of AOX would increase or be maintained at a relatively stable range with time during 30–70 h of induction phase. After that, the activity of AOX would obviously decrease with induction time. However, in this study, as the HSA-GCSFm fusion protein hydrolyzed immediately in the last 10–20 h of induction phase when using traditional or modified DO-stat control mode, we had to finish the methanol feeding fermentation at 70 h (Fig. 2 & 3). In addition, as shown in Fig. 1, methanol dissimilatory (energizing) pathway consists of a couple of sequential reactions catalyzed by AOX, FLD and FDH, respectively. As a result, the changes of the activities of FLD and FDH were extremely same as that in AOX. In summary, when implementing the environment of “methanol limited-DO sufficient” creating by this novel induction strategy (III): 1) methanol concentration was controlled at low levels (0–1 g/L) so that the severe accumulation of any possibly inhibitory metabolites, such as methanol and formaldehyde, could be effectively maintained at almost zero level; 2) methanol induction strength could be assured by maintaining q MeOH at high levels (0.0324 vs 0.0237–0.0281 g-MeOH/g-DCW/h); 3) P. pastoris cells maintenance coefficient was maintained at the lowest levels (0.0126 vs 0.0195 g-MeOH/g-DCW/h) among the three different induction strategies so that methanol distribution ratio towards to the target protein synthesis and P. pastoris cells viability could be obviously increased (87.08% vs 72.16–82.12%); 4) the three key enzymes in methanol metabolism were apparently enhanced; 5) maximum HSA-GCSFm concentration reached the highest level of 0.44 g/L, which was about 46%− 238% increase than that obtained with induction strategies of DO-stat and methanol ON-OFF control."
