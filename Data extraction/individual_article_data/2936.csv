0,Introduction,"The catalytic reduction of amides using molecular hydrogen is an attractive synthesis route for the green and sustainable production of amines at industrial scale [1]. The resulting amines are widely used in the production of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, surfactants, dyes and polymers [2]. Nevertheless, the hydrogenation of carboxylic acid derivatives is particularly challenging because of the low electrophilicity of the CO group compared to other carbonyl compounds [3,4]. Mild temperature hydrogenation of carbonyls such as ketones/aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols over Co-catalysts has been reported [5]. However, carboxamides are among the most stable carboxylic acid derivatives due to the stabilization effect of π-electrons in the carbonyl group by conjugation with nitrogen. This delocalization induces planarity of the amide bond and diminishes the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, making it less susceptible for nucleophilic attack [6]. Although the reduction of amides can be carried out using stoichiometric or excess amounts of hydride reagents, such as, LiAlH4 or NaBH4 it often results in the generation of large amounts of inorganic chemical waste, hence not suitable for industrial application [4,7,8]. The catalytic hydrogenation can be used to reduce amides into amines through CO dissociation using pioneering Cu/CrO based catalyst, however, the process often requires harsh reaction conditions with high temperatures > 250 °C and extremely high hydrogen pressure 200–300 bar [9]. Therefore, the development of heterogeneous catalytic systems for the selective hydrogenation of amides with molecular hydrogen has been intensively studied during the last years for possible implementation under mild conditions at industrial scale. In addition, the catalytic reduction of amide with molecular hydrogen is an atom efficient and environmentally benign process as water would be the only by-product generated. Recent developments on this challenging reaction highlight the importance of using bifunctional catalysts characterized by an optimized synergistic interaction between the active sites, which can lead to a significant decrease in the severity of the reaction conditions. It is well accepted that a combination of hydrogenation active sites such as, Pd, Pt or Rh nanoparticles which are required for the activation of molecular hydrogen, together with oxophilic centres and/or Lewis-acid sites, typically Re, Mo and V-based species necessary to delocalize the charge from CO bond in caboxamide group, can favor the selective hydrogenation process at relatively mild reaction conditions e.g. T < 150 °C and PH2 < 50 bar [10–14]. The design and implementation of an efficient catalytic system would represent a significant step forward on the selective hydrogenation of amides under industrially relevant reaction conditions. The catalytic hydrogenation of amide therefore could present an important advantage for the industrial production of amines, as it could simplify the existing preparation pathway from three to two-step process as shown in Scheme 1 . In this perspective, V-modified Rh supported catalysts were developed for the efficient hydrogenation of tertiary aliphatic amides such as N,N-dimethyl fatty amide into the corresponding N,N-dimethyl fatty amine at relatively mild reaction conditions. The rational design of the bifunctional supported catalyst is based on the modification of an industrial hydrogenation catalyst (Pd, Pt or Rh nanoparticles supported on alumina) with vanadium (V) or molybdenum (Mo) species as oxophilic centres. Wet impregnation or incipient wetness impregnation is by far the most widely used method for the preparation of supported heterogeneous catalysts [15]. This method is attractive particularly for large-scale industrial applications because of its technical simplicity in controlling metal loadings, low costs and limited amount of waste generated. In such a way, one would expect an improved intimacy between the two active components of the catalyst while keeping a rather simple and straightforward preparation methodology. The implementation of this type of bimetallic heterogeneous catalyst can favor the selective hydrogenation of amide to amine via the classical CO cleavage pathway [16,17]."

2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalysts M1-M2/Al2O3, where M1 = Pd, Pt or Rh and M2 = Mo or V, with M1-M2 molar ratio of 1-0.5, 1-1 and 1-2 were prepared by a classical wet-impregnation method. Typically, a precursor solution of vanadyl (IV) acetylacetonate (99 %, J&K Chemical) or molybdenyl acetylacetonate (97 %, J&K Chemical) was prepared by dissolving the desired amount in 90 mL acetone (99 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) at room temperature (≈ 25 °C) under vigorous stirring for 0.5 h. Then, 1.0 g of 5 wt. % Pd/Al2O3, 5 wt. % Pt/Al2O3 or 5 wt. % Rh/Al2O3 catalysts (Johnson Matthey) were added to the precursor solution of vanadyl (IV) acetylacetonate or molybdenyl acetylacetonate under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 4 h. Afterwards, acetone was evaporated at 40 °C under reduced pressure. The recovered powder was dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the materials were calcined in an oven under air at 300 °C for 4 h raised at 2 °C/min. The obtained bimetallic catalysts were subsequently named as Pd-Mo/Al2O3, Pd-V/Al2O3, Pt-Mo/Al2O3, Pt-V/Al2O3, Rh-Mo/Al2O3 and Rh-V/Al2O3. Monometallic V/Al2O3 was also prepared for comparative studies using precursor solution of vanadyl (IV) acetylacetonate and γ-Al2O3 (PURALOX SCCa Sasol)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was conducted in a Perkin Elmer Optima 8000 instrument. The samples were prepared in replicate using 20 mg of dry catalyst and 8 mL of 69 % HNO3 and digested using the CEM Mars microwave digester. The solution was heated to 160 °C for 20 min, held for 10 min, ramped up to 200 °C for 15 min, and held at 200 °C for an additional 10 min. Digested samples were diluted to 50 mL using 18.2 MΩ cm water before ICP-OES analysis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-2200/PC diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) operating at 40 kV over a 2θ range from 10 ° to 80 °. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acquired using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-rays (1486.6 eV) at 225 W powered at 15 kV and 15 mA. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and CO-chemisorption were performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 V3 0.2 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using 100 mg sample. H2-TPR profiles were measured from room temperature to 800 °C with a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C/min under a 10 v/v % H2/Ar flow at 10 mL (STP) per min. For CO-chemisorption experiment, 100 mg catalyst was reduced in a flow of 10 v/v % H2/Ar at temperature ramp rate of 10 °C /min to 200 °C, and then held at 200 °C for 30 min. After that, the sample was cooled down to 50 °C and flushed with He for 30 min. The loop gas of 10 v/v % CO/He was pulsed over the sample and the TCD signal was recorded until the peak area became constant. “In situ” CO-FTIR spectra were collected with a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR apparatus, operating in transmission mode. About 22 mg self-supported 13 mm diameter pressed catalyst pellets were reduced in situ, using a custom-designed glass-cell at T = 200 °C under hydrogen (760 torr), for 2 h, followed by degassing and cooling to ambient temperature. Reference spectra of the clean surfaces were collected at room temperature and high vacuum conditions (10−3 torr). Then, CO chemisorption was performed at room temperature by introducing controlled doses of 10 v/v % CO/He into the adsorption cell, until sample saturation was achieved while collecting spectra after every dose. Finally, CO was evacuated (10−3 torr) and final spectra were collected. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed using JEOL 2100 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray (SEM-EDX) was conducted on a SEM ZEISS EVO 18 with Oxford INCA ENERGY X-Max 20 EDS instrument. The catalyst sample was deposed on a layer of graphite tape and the preparation was coated with Pt for 40S. The sample was observed in HV and BSD mode. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TGA SDT Q600 instrument with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The catalyst weight and weight corrected heat flow were measured from room temperature to 800 °C with a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C/min under air flow."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation The Catalytic hydrogenation of amides N,N-dimethyldodecanamide 1a (99 %, Solvay), N,N-dimethylhexylamide 1b, azepan-2-one 1c, dodecanamide 1d, benzamide 1e, isophthalamide 1f, and decanediamide 1g (99 %, J&K Chemical) was performed in a 30 mL stainless-steel autoclave. Typically, 0.5 mmol of the amide was first diluted in 5 mL of dimethoxy ethane (DME) (99 %, J&K Chemical) solvent. The obtained reaction mixture was charged into the reactor, followed by the addition of 0.1 g of catalyst. Then, the autoclave was sealed, purged several times with hydrogen and finally, pressurized up to the desired H2 pressure at room temperature. The charged reactor was placed in a preheated aluminum block at the desired temperature and time under constant stirring 600 rpm. When the reaction was completed, the reactor was quenched with ice water. After cooling the reactor to room temperature and depressurization to atmospheric pressure, n-dodecane (99 %, J&K Chemical) was added to the reaction mixture as an external standard. The liquid reaction mixture was filtered and analyzed by GC–FID and GC–MS."
5,Results and discussions,"To validate our hypothesis, catalyst screening for the hydrogenation of N,N-dimethyldodecanamide 1a into the desired product N,N-dimethyldodecanamine 2a (Scheme 2 ) was conducted over monometallic Pd/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3 and Rh/Al2O3 catalysts at 130 °C, 30 bar H2 in dimethoxyethane (DME) as solvent for 1 h (Fig. 1 ). Both Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 were not active and no products were detected at these reaction conditions. On the other hand, Rh/Al2O3 was slightly active achieving 8 % amide 1a conversion and 5 % amine 2a yield. The catalysts were then modified using molybdenyl acetylacetonate as Mo precursor and vanadyl (IV) acetylacetonate as V precursor by impregnation method followed by calcination in air. The molar ratios of M1 and M2, for example Rh and V in Rh-V/Al2O3 were kept at 1−1 for all the prepared catalysts. After modification by Mo, an increase in amide 1a conversion from zero to 31 % and subsequent amine 2a yield to 25 % was observed over bimetallic Pd-Mo/Al2O3. Modified Pt-Mo/Al2O3 and Pd-V/Al2O3 were to a lower extent active at 6 % and 8 % amide 1a conversion, respectively, almost similar to unmodified Rh/Al2O3 catalyst. Modification of Rh/Al2O3 by Mo was much better as Rh-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst display an increase in both amide 1a conversion and amine 2a yield to 70 %, respectively. Interestingly, an increase in amide 1a conversion to 45 % and amine 2a yield 40 % was obtained over Pt-V/Al2O3. An even dramatic improvement was achieved with Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst achieving 94 % amide 1a conversion and quantitative amine 2a yield. The improved catalytic efficiency might be linked to the favored interaction generated between Rh and the deposited V species. The impact of molar ratios of M1 and M2, i.e. Rh and V in bimetallic Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst was further investigated. For this, Rh-V/Al2O3 catalysts with nominal Rh-V molar ratios of 1−0.5, 1−1 and 1−2 were compared in addition to Al2O3, Rh/Al2O3 and V/Al2O3 (Table 1 ). The actual metal loadings of Rh and V in wt. % and the molar ratio Rh-V in the catalysts as determined by ICP-OES are very close to the nominal values (Table 1). A good agreement is observed between the nominal to actual Rh and V molar ratios in 1−0, 1−0.6, 1−1.1, 1−2.2, and 0−1 catalysts. These results confirm that wet-impregnation method allows easy control of the desired metal loadings in the catalysts. Al2O3 and V/Al2O3 were not active at all in the reduction of N,N-dimethyldodecanamide 1a at these conditions due to lack of hydrogenation active sites. It can be seen that modified Rh-V/Al2O3 with 1−1.1 Rh-V molar ratio had the optimal performance with 94 % amide 1a conversion and quantitative amine 2a yield under mild reaction conditions. Rh-V/Al2O3 with 1−0.6 Rh-V molar ratio had very low catalytic activity probably due to low amount of V species. On the other hand, Rh-V/Al2O3 with 1−2.2 Rh-V molar ratio achieved 63 % amide 1a conversion and 62 % amine 2a yield, significantly lower than optimal Rh-V/Al2O3 with 1−1.1 Rh-V molar ratio. This could be due to reduced metal dispersion at 19.26 % in Rh-V/Al2O3 (1−2.2) catalyst compared to 28.86 % metal dispersion in Rh-V/Al2O3 (1−1.1) and the combination of hydrogenation and oxophilic centres is not optimum. In addition, Rh-V/Al2O3 with Rh-V 1−1.1 M ratio presented the highest TOF value of 1.12 × 10−1 s−1 (Table 1, entry 4). TOF was defined as the number of moles of amine, per mole of Rh, metal dispersion and unit time. Based on these remarkable results, it was therefore decided to focus on modified Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst with Rh-V molar ratio 1−1.1 in the due course of the study. To better understand the effect of V on the physico-chemical properties of the native Rh catalyst and how such interactions benefit the overall reactivity, detailed characterizations were conducted for both Rh/Al2O3 and Rh-V/Al2O3. The structural properties of these materials were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As it can be observed in Fig. 2 , very similar XRD patterns were obtained for both Rh/Al2O3 and the modified bimetallic Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst. The reflections coming from γ-Al2O3 used as support material were predominant in these catalysts (JCPDS 10-0425). The absence of XRD reflections coming from Rh and/or V-related species point out to the generation of either amorphous phases or the presence of highly dispersed species on the surface of γ-Al2O3. A slight modification in the base line of the XRD profile of Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst at around 35 2θ angle as indicated by an arrow in Fig. 2 could indicate the formation of Rh2O3 phase which has the most intense reflection i.e. 110 crystallographic plane is expected to appear at 2θ value of 35 ° (JCPDS 43-1025). Although oxidized Rh phases could be generated during the thermal decomposition of V precursor, the occurrence and exact nature of these species cannot be certainly concluded from XRD analysis. The oxidation states of Rh/Al2O3 and Rh-V/Al2O3 catalysts components was confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 3 depicts the results obtained from the analysis of Rh 3d and V 2p XPS levels of the two studied materials. Regardless of the presence of V, Rh 3d spectra can be fitted by using a doublet (ΔBE = 4.9 eV) which corresponds to the oxide Rhδ+ chemical environment. The Rh 3d5/2 component centered around 309.4 eV, can be assigned to RhO2, (i.e. Rh4+), but also non-stoichiometric Rh2O3-type species (Fig. 3a). However, in the case of bare Rh/Al2O3 catalyst, it was also possible to identify the presence of metallic Rh, characterized by the Rh 3d5/2 component located at 307.6 eV [18,19]. Thus, it can be inferred that Rh/Al2O3 catalyst contains both oxidized Rh species (Rh4+ and/or Rh3+), as well as metallic Rh0 species. Nevertheless, after impregnation of V, metallic Rh is oxidized during the calcination step at 300 °C in air for Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst. This result confirms the presence of Rh oxide species preferably in the V-modified catalyst as suggested before from XRD results. On the other hand, the position of V 2p3/2 core level, at 517.8 eV confirms the presence of V5+, most probably as V2O5 on V-modified Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 3b). Despite that, the presence of V4+ having a V 2p1/2 core level typically located between 516.5 eV and 517.1 eV cannot be discarded [20,21]. In the case of unmodified Rh/Al2O3 catalyst, the broad peak observed in the V 2p level, centered at 523.4 eV, can come from the contribution of Rh 3p1/2 core level of Rhδ+ species at ∼524 eV and/or an oxygen satellite (O 1s’) peak [22,23]. Considering the results observed by XRD and XPS, it is clear that both Rh and V are present as oxidized species on the as-prepared Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst. However, an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of amides should have an active hydrogenation site to activate molecular hydrogen. Thus, given the excellent catalytic results presented beforehand, metallic Rh should be generated “in-situ” under the applied reaction conditions, typically 130 °C and 30 bar H2. As can be seen in Fig. 4 , the H2-TPR profiles of Rh/Al2O3 and Rh-V/Al2O3 catalysts evidence the reduction of Rhδ+ species to Rh0 at temperatures below 130 °C. Such reduction peaks at 70 °C and 82 °C for Rh/Al2O3 and Rh-V/Al2O3, respectively, are characteristic of the highly dispersed Rh oxide species, for which the H2 consumption observed would correspond mainly to the presence of RhO2. The shift observed in this low temperature peak on Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst could be linked to the presence of oxidized vanadium species, which partially hinders the accessibility of hydrogen to the rhodium sites. In addition, a much smaller second reduction peak located at around 200 °C could be associated with the presence of strongly attached Rh species on Al2O3 surface and/or the presence of agglomerated RhxOy, probably formed after the calcination step [24]. In the case of modified Rh-V/Al2O3, an additional reduction peak centered at 501 °C could be correlated to the reduction of V5+ to V3+ species [25]. However, the hydrogen consumption does not necessarily match with such single reduction process confirming the presence of V in different oxidation states, probably V5+ and V4+. In such a way, as the reduction of VxOy species take place at relatively high temperature, it can be implied that under the conducted reaction conditions of 130 °C and 30 bar H2, Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst is characterized by the presence of Rh0 nanoparticles used for hydrogen activation, and oxidized V species as active sites for CO activation of the carboxamide function. CO-chemisorption was applied to evaluate the effect of V species on the reactivity of Rh0 nanoparticles, and potentially how close the interaction of these metals is after modification. The CO uptake decreased from 0.213 mmol/g in Rh/Al2O3 to 0.140 mmol/g in Rh-V/Al2O3. This shows that the presence of V has a detrimental effect on the CO-adsorption capacity of Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst. This behavior is evidence of the direct interaction of V with Rh0, blocking some of the characteristic CO-adsorption sites on the surface of Rh. Similar observations were also reported on vanadium oxide promoted Rh catalysts using different supports such as SiO2 and Al2O3, as well as different preparation methodologies [26]. The metal particle size was 3.2 nm in Rh-V/Al2O3 as determined by CO-chemisorption. “In-situ” CO-FTIR adsorption was further conducted to gain additional insights on the nature of Rh sites covered by the vanadium species. Fig. 5 shows the CO-FTIR adsorption spectra obtained for Rh/Al2O3 and Rh-V/Al2O3 catalysts. Rh/Al2O3 shows a strong band at 2049 cm−1 with two shoulders at 2083 and 2014 cm−1, as well as a broad band at 1860 cm−1. The band at 2049 cm−1 could be assigned to linear-bonded CO on Rh (CO-Rh), whereas the one at 1860 cm−1 might be attributed to bridge-bonded CO on Rh0 (CO-Rh-CO) [27–29]. CO adsorption bands typical of Rh(I)(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl were observed at 2083 cm−1 and 2014 cm−1 corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric vibrations, respectively [30]. Taking into account that the catalysts were in-situ reduced at 200 °C for 2 h under 760 torr H2 before the adsorption of CO, the presence of Rh+ species could be interpreted as Rh oxidation in the presence of CO, which would involve hydroxyl groups of Al2O3 support (2Rh0 + 4CO + 2AlOH → H2 + 2Al-O-Rh(CO)2) [31]. However, the adsorption of CO on isolated Rh atoms and/or subnanometric Rh0 nanoparticles could also lead to similar adsorption bands [32]. The spectrum of Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst is notably similar to non-modified Rh/Al2O3. The position of the four peaks previously observed and described remained the same with a small shift by approximately 7 cm−1 with respect to Rh/Al2O3. On the other hand, the intensity of the adsorption band associated to the bridge-bonded CO on Rh0 is different in these two catalysts. In the case of Rh-V/Al2O3, the band is largely less intense and centered at around 1818 cm−1. Thus, it can be inferred that V directly interacts with Rh, blocking some specific CO adsorption sites, which involve at least two atoms of Rh. This result is a clear indication of the direct interaction of V and Rh in the modified Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst, pointing out to a very close interaction of the metallic function and the oxophilic sites. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was conducted to measure the metal particle size and its distribution on the catalysts. Fig. 6 shows TEM micrographs of a) Rh/Al2O3 and b) Rh-V/Al2O3 catalysts. The two catalysts were characterized by very high dispersion with small metal particles of average size ≈ 3 nm and narrow particle size distribution indicating that the impregnation of V followed by calcination step did not affect the Rh particle sizes. SEM-EDX elemental mapping of Rh and V in the modified bimetallic Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst with 1−1.1 M ratio shows a homogeneous metal distribution on Al2O3 (Fig. 7 ). These results confirm that wet-impregnation method allows easy control and even distribution V on Rh/Al2O3 catalysts. The elemental composition of 4.66 wt. % Rh and 2.39 wt. % V in Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst based on EDS analysis was in good agreement to ICP-OES analysis. The presented characterization results evidence an intimate contact of Rh with V species present in the modified catalyst after impregnation and calcination steps. It can be inferred that vanadium oxidized species are positioned on top of Rh0 nanoparticles in Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst, favoring the required synergy between hydrogenation sites and oxophillic centres that results in the remarkable catalytic activity observed for the selective hydrogenation of amide 1a to amine 2a. Moreover, the selectivity of the reaction towards the desired amine remains over 95 % regardless of the conversion achieved as a function of time (Fig. 8 ). Additionally, an almost complete conversion can be reached after 2 h reaction, obtaining amine 2a as the main hydrogenation product and only trace amounts of dodecanol generated due to CN dissociation. The influence of some reaction variables, such as temperature and H2 pressure in the selective hydrogenation of amide 1a over Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst with Rh-V molar ratio of 1−1.1 was studied. The obtained results are summarized in Table 2 . As expected, an increase in temperature from 90 °C to 130 °C at 40 bar H2 pressure resulted in an increase in both amide 1a conversion and quantitative amine 2a yield, from 81 % to 99 %, respectively (Table 2, entries 1–5), whereas the highest TOF of 1.18 × 10−1 s−1 was obtained at 120 °C and 40 bar H2. Even a low temperature of 90 °C was sufficient to “in situ” generate metallic Rh hydrogenation sites on Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst, as anticipated from the H2-TPR results (Fig. 4). H2 pressure was also observed to influence the hydrogenation rate from amide 1a to amine 2a at 110 °C (Table 2, entries 6–9). By increasing H2 pressure from 20 bar to 40 bar, both the conversion of amide 1a and quantitative yield to amine 2a were increased from 66 % to 98 %, respectively. As can be seen, H2 pressure appears to affect only the extent of amide 1a conversion but had no impact on amine 2a selectivity at these reaction conditions. Finally, as catalyst stability is crucial for the development of an efficient industrial catalyst, the reusability of Rh-V/Al2O3 was considered (Fig. 9 ). For this study, Rh-V/Al2O3 was recovered by centrifugation after every catalytic cycle, washed with ethanol and DME, and then used for the next reaction cycle without any pre-treatment. The catalyst was reused for at least four cycles without any apparent loss of amide 1a conversion and amine 2a yield. However, a more pronounced decrease in quantitative amide 1a conversion and amine 2a yield, from the initial 98 % to 74 %, respectively, was observed after the seventh cycle. XRD analysis of the used Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst after the seventh cycle was inconclusive. No obvious change was observed at these conditions as the XRD patterns of catalysts before and after reuse appear identical (Fig. 10 ). TGA Analysis of Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst before and after recycling tests was conducted (Fig. 11 ). Prior to analysis, the used Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst after the seventh cycle was centrifuged, washed with ethanol and dried overnight at 80 °C. As shown in Fig. 11b, weight loss due to thermal decomposition of organic carbonaceous deposits on used Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst in the oxidizing atmosphere is observed with a peak of weight corrected heat flow centered at 258 °C. On the other hand, no significant weight loss was observed in this temperature range for the fresh Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 11a). The decrease in catalytic activity during recycling tests after the seventh cycle can therefore be due to coke formation on Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst. No leaching of metal species was identified in the final reaction mixture, as determined by ICP-OES analysis. Given the excellent catalytic properties shown by the Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst on the selective transformation of a tertiary amide 1a to the respective amine 2a at mild reaction conditions, a representative substrate scope study was performed by considering the hydrogenation of secondary and primary amides. Table 3 summarizes the catalytic results obtained from the selective hydrogenation of a cyclic secondary amide azepan-2-one 1c to the corresponding amine azepane 2c (Scheme 3 ), at the given reaction conditions. Regardless of the reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure used, amide 1c was quantitatively converted to the desired amine 2c. Only in the case of complete amide 1c conversion achieved at 150 °C and 30 bar H2 pressure (Table 3, entry 4), the selectivity towards the desired amine 2c was slightly affected at 95 % after 5 h. TOF was the highest at 1.18 × 10−1 s−1 at these conditions. The undesired products generated under these reaction conditions were linked to the ring opening of the cyclic amide, leading to the generation of hexaneamide and hexanamine. In line with what was previously observed for amide 1a, H2 pressure appears to affect only the extent of amide 1c conversion from 21 % at 5 bar to 86 % at 45 bar, and had no impact on amine 2c selectivity at these reaction conditions. Finally, the catalytic performance of Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst in the hydrogenation of representative tertiary, secondary and primary amides is summarized in Table 4 . The trend in amide conversion and amine selectivity for aliphatic tertiary amides N,N-dimethyldodecanamide 1a and N,N-dimethylhexylamide 1b was very similar giving 99 % yield and TOF value 1.18 × 10−1 s−1. (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). Likewise, secondary amide azepan-2-one 1c can be successfully hydrogenated into corresponding secondary amine azepane 2c in 95 % yield (Table 4, entry 3). However, the efficiency of the selective hydrogenation process for primary amides was not as high as in the case of tertiary and secondary amides. In the case of aliphatic dodecanamide 1d, only 40 % dodecanamine 2d yield could be obtained at 130 °C and 30 bar H2 pressure after 5 h reaction, dodecanol being the main side product (Table 4, entry 4). As for aromatic benzamide 1e, although the carboxamide group could be reduced at 130 °C and 30 bar H2 pressure after 1 h reaction, the benzene ring was inevitably hydrogenated, forming cyclohexanemethanamine 2e in 70 % yield (Table 4, entry 5). The other products obtained were cyclohexylmethanol 21 % and bis(cyclohexylmethyl)amine 9 %. The hydrogenation of aromatic diamide, isophthalamide 1f was not selective over Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst in DME solvent. The hydrogenation of aliphatic diamide, decanediamide 1g proceeded to decanediamine 2g, however at low conversion and low yield 10 %. In fact, primary amides are much more challenging substrates to be selectively hydrogenated to the respective amines because of the less activated nature of the CO and CN bonds when compared with substituted amides (secondary and tertiary amides). Additional investigations on suitable catalyst composition and optimization of reaction conditions are being studied to improve the efficiency of the process towards the selective hydrogenation of primary amides."
6,Conclusions,"Selective hydrogenation of tertiary and secondary amides was investigated over modified bimetallic catalysts. The modification of an industrial Rh-supported catalyst by impregnation with vanadium species i.e. Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst was demonstrated as a simple methodology to obtain efficient and stable catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of amides into amines. The bimetallic Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst was well characterized using several techniques to elucidate the nature of active sites. The strong synergistic interaction and proximity of hydrogenation Rh0 sites and oxophilic Vδ+ sites in the bimetallic Rh-V/Al2O3 catalyst was determined to be beneficial for the selective dissociation of CO bond of the carboxamides into amines. The bimetallic catalyst was demonstrated to be effective in the selective hydrogenation of N,N-dimethyldodecanamide 1a and azepan-2-one 1b to the corresponding amines, achieving over 95 % selectivity at relatively moderate reaction conditions. Primary amides are much more challenging substrates to be selectively hydrogenated to the respective amines because of the less activated nature of the CO and CN bonds."
