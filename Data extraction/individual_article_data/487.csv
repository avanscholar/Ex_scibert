0,Introduction,"In addition to its extensive use in refineries and chemical industries for the synthesis of many products including ammonia and methanol [1,2], hydrogen has been gaining fame and importance in recent years as a means of energy storage. Traditional methods of obtaining hydrogen, which involve steam reforming of natural gas and petroleum, require high pressures (15–40bar) and temperatures (650–950°C) and, importantly, the use of non-renewable raw materials [3–5]. Methods which employ renewable resources, like biomass reforming, and which moreover operate in ambient conditions, like electrolysis with solar power, are acquiring a growing relevance among hydrogen production processes. In this respect, photocatalysis in non-aerated conditions, though still in its research phase, is considered to be a promising option [6–10]. Essentially, this involves a redox process initiated by solar energy that provokes the promotion of an electron in a semiconductor resulting in a separation of electron–hole (e−–h+) charges which, on migrating to the semiconductor surface, give rise to reduction and oxidation reactions. (1) H 2 O ⟶ TiO 2 ( h μ ) H 2 + 1 / 2 O 2 At the present time, there is no known semiconductor that produces hydrogen from pure water with high efficiency [Eq. (1)] [11,12]. Normally, solutions of pollutants are used which capture more efficiently the holes and impede recombination of the e−–h+ pair. The process involved in the presence of organic compounds is not therefore a case of water photosplitting but rather the photoreforming of organic compounds. That is, a photocatalytic decontamination treatment is taking place at the same time as hydrogen is being produced which results in oxidation of the organic compounds with water to CO2 and hydrogen [Eq. (2)]. (2) C x H y O z +(2x − z)H2O→ xCO2 + (2x − z + y/2)H2O The possibility of utilizing biomass-derived compounds and waste organic materials as sacrificial agents for the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen production was first investigated by Kawai and Sakata [13]. There have been many studies published in the literature about the use of methanol as a sacrificial agent and it is this alcohol which is considered a model molecule in the application of photocatalysis in photoreforming, just as phenol is in photo-oxidation [14]. Methanol captures the holes more rapidly than ethanol or 2-propanol [15], it has a high hydrogen/carbon ratio and, like ethanol, can be obtained from biomass [16]. Other substances have also been tested including alkanes and alkenes, glucose, [17–20], phenol [21], organic acids [22,23] and dyes [24], but the results have not been as efficient as those reported in studies with alcohols and, more specifically, with methanol. The fact that waste with a significant alcohol content is being generated in our industrialized world constitutes a serious environmental problem. Take for example the cases of waste containing glycerol and ethyleneglycol. In the biodiesel production industry, glycerol is generated and accumulated at a rate of 1kg for each 10kg of biodiesel that is produced [25,26]. A solution needs to be found for the enormous amounts of glycerol that are being generated and the resulting potential problems for the environment. Amongst other substances, and in addition to methanol, water and inorganic salts, glycerol contains free fatty acids, triglycerides and methyl esters. As a result, refining raw glycerol to a degree of purity that would allow it to be used in industrial applications in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors is an extremely costly process. Consequently, other options have been considered for dealing with glycerol including the synthesis of other products like glyceric acid [27] or its possible use in hydrogen production. Ethyleneglycol is also an important contaminant that is generated from its use as an additive in automobile and aviation coolants and anti-freeze. The most widely used semiconductor in these processes is TiO2. In addition to its relatively low band-gap and the suitable position of its valence and conduction bands for the redox processes that are involved, it has the advantages of a low cost and chemical and photochemical stability [28]. Due to its simplicity, one of the most economic procedures for TiO2 synthesis is the sol–gel method. Our research team has developed a photocatalyst which has been shown in the literature to give highly competitive results when compared with the commercial Aeroxide P25 TiO2 photocatalyst in photocatalytic processes of aerated degradation [29] and hydrogen production [30]. In the field of hydrogen production, the simplest modification that is made to the TiO2 and which results in an increase in hydrogen production of up to 3 orders of magnitude is the deposition of metals on its surface. These metal deposits contribute to improving the activity by trapping the electrons with a consequent enhancement of the e−–h+ pair separation. The most commonly used metals are Au and Pt, with the best results being reported for Pt [3,31–35]. The aim of the work undertaken and described in the present article is to test the efficiency of a sol–gel synthesized photocatalyst modified with Pt deposits (SG750-2.1wt%) in hydrogen production by photocatalytic means. For this purpose, the activity of this photocatalyst was compared when using different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethyleneglycol and glycerol) as sacrificial agent. The concentration of these sacrificial agents was optimized and an analysis performed of some of the intermediates that were generated. Finally, the stability of this catalyst was tested in reuse cycles and compared with that of other commercial photocatalysts."
1,Material and methods,
2,Reagents and materials,"2.1 Reagents and materials The non-commercial SG750 photocatalyst was synthesized by the sol–gel method from titanium (IV) t-butoxide. The synthesis procedure for this catalyst is a modification of the procedure described in patent WO 2013117778 A1. A description of its synthesis and characterization can be found in [30]. The commercial catalyst, Aeroxide TiO2 P25 (47.2±0.1m2 g−1, 79%/21% anatase/rutile), was supplied by Evonik and the Hombikat UV-100 (202±1m2 g−1, 100% anatase) by Sachtleben Chemie GmbH. The methanol (99%), ethanol (99.5%) and ethyleneglycol (99%) were supplied by Panreac and the glycerol (99.5%) by Sigma–Aldrich."
3,Photodeposition,"2.2 Photodeposition Pt deposition was carried out by photodeposition from hexachloroplatinic acid (IV) (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Merck 40% Pt), obtaining a catalyst with 2.1wt% which we named SG750-2.1wt%. The procedure followed is a modification of the method described by Kraeutler and Bard [36]. The photoreactor was supplied by Photochemical Reactors Ltd. 2g of catalyst, 400mL of a 0.3M solution of isopropanol and the appropriate amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O to obtain the desired percentage were introduced into the reactor flask. A medium-pressure mercury lamp (400W) was introduced into the interior of a quartz immersion well and a constant temperature of 25°C was controlled by means of a thermostatic bath. Illumination was maintained for 6h under continuous flow of N2 and with continuous stirring. Photocatalyst recovery was performed by filtration, washing and subsequent overnight drying in an oven at 110°C."
4,Equipment,"2.3 Equipment BET surface area and pore volume by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method were determined using N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77K measured with a Micromeritics 2010 system. Phase composition and crystal sizes were estimated from XRD patterns recorded on a Siemens D-501 diffractometer equipped with a Ni filter and graphite monochromator using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å). Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 5 and the Kubelka–Munk function, F(R ∞), was applied to obtain the band-gaps following the method proposed by Tandon and Gupta [37]. The morphology of the sample and Pt cluster size distribution were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Zeiss EM 910 instrument equipped with a Proscan Slow Scan CCD camera. JEOL JEM 2100 equipment was also used for high resolution images (HR-TEM). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 microscope."
5,Photocatalytic test,"2.4 Photocatalytic test The experimental set-up has been previously described [34]. It consists of a purpose-designed borosilicate photoreactor to which 75mL of the photocatalyst suspension at 1gL−1 are added along with the predetermined concentration of the alcohol. The suspension is subjected to continuous stirring and pH adjusted to 5 using NaOH. After purging the reactor by bubbling the suspension with He, a continuous flow is allowed through the reactor headspace of 10mLmin−1 regulated by a mass flow controller and the lighting is activated. The light source consists of 3 Philips Solarium lamps, each comprising 4×15W fluorescent tubes which emit between 300 and 400nm with a maximum at 365nm. The lighting is kept switched on for 3.5h. During this time the gas flow is injected into a MicroGC 490 Agilent chromatograph with He as gas carrier and equipped with TCD detector, a MolSieve5A column for hydrogen and carbon monoxide detection and a PoraPLOT Q column for measurement of carbon dioxide, methane and ethane. The concentration of formaldehyde in liquid phase was quantified by a spectrophotometric method [38] and the formic and acetic acid by high resolution liquid chromatography using Varian ProStar equipment with a UV–vis diode array detector (Supelcogel column, H3PO4 1vol.% of phosphoric acid in water, 1mLmin−1, 25°C). The acetaldehyde was analyzed using a Shimadzu GC2010 Plus chromatograph equipped with a CP-WAX 52 CB column, 0.25mm×30m, and an FID detector. The total organic carbon in solution was measured using a Shimadzu TOC-VCSN analyzer."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization Table 1 represents some of the characteristics of the SG750 and SG750-2.1wt% catalysts taken from previous works [30,35]. In brief, SG750 is a 73% anatase catalyst with a small surface area (15.2m2 g−1), as is clear from the large particle size in the image in Fig. 1 . As reported in [35], 55% of the Pt particles of this catalyst are between 2.01 and 3.00nm in size and more than 90% are below 5nm, which would appear to favor a higher level of activity [39]. The presence of Pt particles modifies the catalyst surface, slightly increasing its size and decreasing pore volume. According to estimated band-gap values, a redshift was observed of the onset of the visible spectrum compared to the photocatalyst without Pt. Nonetheless, no modification can be observed of the crystalline structure in terms of crystal size or phase percentages."
8,Sacrificial agent,"3.2 Sacrificial agent 3.2.1 Methanol Methanol is considered the model molecule in studies of photocatalysis applied to the production of hydrogen. New synthesized materials are commonly tested with this substance as it is considered to be the electron donor with the highest activity [3,33,40–44]. In continuous flow systems, in which a carrier gas passes continuously through the reactor during the hydrogen production process, a three-stage pattern is commonly observed in the production of hydrogen over time [39]: (i) an initial period during which the rate of hydrogen production gradually increases, (ii) a maximum period of production in which hydrogen production remains more or less stable or increases at a slower rate, and (iii) a final stage in which the fall in hydrogen production corresponds either to exhaustion of the sacrificial agent or deactivation of the catalyst. In the tests conducted for the purpose of the present study, considering the 3.5h duration and the sacrificial agent concentrations used, a steady-state regime was obtained after approximately 90min and the sacrificial agent was not exhausted. If we assume that the entire hydrogen production in the 3.5h with the lowest tested load of 1.22M was due exclusively to the first step of oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde (2:1 ratio methanol/H2) [Eqs. (6) and (7)], this would be equivalent to the photoreforming of just 3.3% of the initial methanol. Fig. 2A shows the maximum production rates and the total micromoles of hydrogen generated in 3.5h for different initial concentrations of methanol. Note how hydrogen production increases with the initial methanol concentration until reaching a maximum of 1134μmolh−1 for a 70% (v/v) concentration (17.13M). Though this level of production is maintained at similar levels at higher concentrations, at a 100% (v/v) sacrificial agent concentration hydrogen production falls to similar levels to that of the lowest tested methanol concentration, namely 564μmolh−1. In aqueous-alcohol solutions at low concentrations the hydrogen production rate is proportional to the concentration of methanol, while at higher concentrations it approaches a constant value [45,46]. This behavior could be related in continuous operating regimes in the photoreactor with a situation in which the rate at which the methanol disappears (−r m ) would display a Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) type response, such that: (3) ( − r M ) s . s . = k M K M C M 0 1 + K M C M 0 where k M is the specific rate constant in molL−1 h−1, K M is the L–H adsorption constant for methanol in Lmol−1, C M 0 is the initial concentration of methanol in molL−1, and the subscript s.s. denotes the steady state situation of the reactor. The disappearance rate of the methanol can be related to the hydrogen formation rate, this being an experimentally measured variable, in accordance with the stoichiometry of Eq. (2) and giving rise to: (4) ( r H 2 ) s . s . 3 = ( − r M ) s . s = k M K M C M 0 1 + K M C M 0 In accordance with the results presented in Fig. 2A, and taking the origin as initial operating condition, it is feasible to obtain the parameters of Eq. (4) for the assumed L–H model by applying a two-parameter nonlinear regression fit (Fig. 3A). K M = 0.6 9 ± 0.1 5 L mol − 1 k M = 4.0 × 10 − 2 mol h − 1 L − 1 I . C . 95 % ( k M ) = [ 0.026,0.049 ] I.C. 95% (k M ) expresses the confidence interval at 95% estimated for the value of the specific rate constant. The p-values which were obtained from estimation of the parameters of the L–H model were, in both cases, lower than 0.05, with a standard error of regression of the model of 0.002. This model has been applied by other authors in much smaller ranges of concentrations than that presented in the present study [45,47]. The inability of the L–H model to explain higher concentrations makes the application of more complete models necessary, such as that developed by Chiarello et al. [48]. The photoreforming process of methanol [Eq. (5)], like that of the subsequent sacrificial agents, entails complex mechanisms that involve a series of steps in which different oxidation intermediates are produced, each of which contributes to the reduction of H+ for the generation of H2 [Eqs. (6)–(12)]. (5) CH3OH+H2O→CO2 +3H2 (6) CH3OH+h+(or OH)→CH3O +H+ (or H2O) (7) CH3O +h+ (or OH)→CH2O+H+ (or H2O) (8) CH2O+h+ (or OH)→CHO +H+ (or H2O) (9) H2O+h+ → OH+H+ (10) CHO + OH→HCOOH (11) HCOOH+h+ (or OH)→HCOO +H+ (or H2O) (12) HCOO +h+ (or OH)→CO2 +H+ (or H2O) The intermediates that have been found according to this mechanism [45,48] and as reported in the bibliography include formaldehyde, formic acid and carbon dioxide. In addition, if dehydration of the formic acid takes place then carbon monoxide could be produced in accordance with [Eq. (13)][3,45]. (13) HCOOH→CO+H2O Carbon monoxide is an unwanted by-product not only as a result of its toxicity, but also due to its known ability to poison fuel cell membranes [4,49]. Some authors claim to have detected even more intermediates including methyl formate, acetaldehyde and dimethyl ether as well as traces of methane and ethane [3], so the methanol transformation mechanism may not be as simple as that outlined above [Eqs. (6)–(12)]. Fig. 2A also shows the concentrations of the principal intermediates of the oxidation of methanol quantified in suspension after conclusion of the 3.5h of the photocatalytic test. It can be seen, in general, that the concentration of formaldehyde increases progressively with methanol concentration and hydrogen production. However, at 100% (v/v) methanol, where hydrogen production falls to similar levels to those observed for the lowest tested methanol concentration, an accumulation of formaldehyde is observed which is more than three times higher than that observed for 1.22M of methanol. For any methanol concentration, the measured concentrations of formic acid are low, less than 0.62mM, two orders of magnitude lower than for the formaldehyde. These formaldehyde and formic acid values are in concordance with the mechanism proposed above where it is observed that the oxidation of formaldehyde, and therefore the formation of formic acid, is strongly inhibited in the absence of water [Eq. (10)], the main source of hydroxyl radicals [Eq. (9)]. As for gaseous intermediates, though carbon monoxide has been observed by other authors [31,50,51], it was not detected using the analytical techniques employed in the present study. The absence of this intermediate could indicate that in our system the holes are sufficiently available for the formic acid to degrade more rapidly through direct/indirect capture of the holes than through a thermal catalysis [45]. In the gaseous phase in this study, only methane and carbon dioxide were detected. Methane was detected for all tested methanol concentrations, though since only traces were detected at 100% (v/v) concentration it would seem that its formation is related to the presence of water. The formation of methane plays a negative role in the production of hydrogen as the mechanism by which it could form, reduction of methanol or reduction of CO2, consume H+ and photogenerated electrons [52,53]. The patterns of methane concentration (not shown) show a rising tendency over the 3.5h duration of the test, with maximum methane concentrations of around 0.65–1.94μmolh−1. As for CO2, the total CO2 micromoles produced in the 3.5h of the test follow the pattern of hydrogen production. There is a rising trend in CO2 concentration except in the case of 100% (v/v) methanol (Fig. 2B), where the CO2 concentration reaches a maximum before slowly beginning to fall. The total CO2 micromoles produced for 100% (v/v) sacrificial agent are much lower than those obtained for the lowest tested concentration of 1.22M. This concurs with the accumulation of formaldehyde at 100% (v/v) methanol and the inhibition of formic acid and CO2, as water is needed for a complete mineralization [3,48]. The accumulation of intermediates could result in early deactivation of the catalyst as a slight decrease in hydrogen production can be observed after the maximum rate is obtained (Fig. 3B). 3.2.2 Ethanol In the case of ethanol, the hydrogen production pattern displayed the same trend as that observed for methanol, except at 100% (v/v) where there is a significant decrease in hydrogen production immediately after the maximum rate is obtained (Fig. 3B). Fig. 4A shows the maximum production rates and the total micromoles of hydrogen generated in 3.5h for the different tested initial concentrations of ethanol. Note how hydrogen production increases with ethanol concentration up to 1089μmolh−1 at 43% (v/v) concentration (7.34M), before decreasing slightly at higher concentrations. In the absence of water, at 100% (v/v) ethanol, total hydrogen production falls considerably, with the plot of hydrogen production over time even suggesting a significant deactivation of the photocatalyst during the course of the 3.5h of the test (Fig. 3B). It was observed that catalyst activity could be regenerated by the addition of water (data not shown), essential for complete mineralization of the sacrificial agent. This avoids blockage taking place of the active adsorption centers of the catalyst surface by adsorption of intermediates generated by direct oxidation of the ethanol, which would impede other alcohol molecules accessing it and therefore oxidizing [48]. Such increases and decreases in hydrogen production have been observed by other authors [33], though in our case the production values obtained are much higher. Contrary to the widespread idea that hydrogen production is higher with methanol than ethanol [15,21], we found ethanol to be superior to methanol at the lowest tested concentration of 1.22M. In other words, and as previously suggested by Strataki et al. [33], ethanol is a better producer of hydrogen than methanol at low concentrations. This is because at low alcohol concentrations, according to Chiarello et al. [48], the principal oxidation mechanism is indirect oxidation via hydroxyl radicals as the water is more likely to reach the holes. Ethanol can clearly compete with methanol as their adsorption energies on the TiO2 surface are very similar [54]. This suggests that there must be other factors, such as the adsorption forces of the generated intermediates, which favor hydrogen production for the case of ethanol over that of methanol. At higher concentrations, where the mechanism of direct oxidation prevails, methanol traps the holes more efficiently and produces a larger amount of hydrogen as it is a better hole scavenger than ethanol and water [55]. All the intermediates proposed in the literature for ethanol photoreforming were identified and quantified, namely CO2, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and methane [32], as well as ethane. Methane formation has only rarely reported and to date no reports of ethane formation have been published. Bamwenda et al. [32] are the only authors in this field to propose routes that explain methane formation, namely decarboxylation of acetic acid or hydrogenation of CO2. However, nothing has been said about ethane formation and we deduce that it could be formed from the union of two methyl radicals [56] generated as a result of acetic acid decarboxylation. Fig. 4A also shows the intermediates measured in aqueous phase, acetaldehyde and acetic acid. It can be seen how the concentration of acetaldehyde increases with the production of hydrogen, attaining a maximum value of 40.5mM for 7.34M of ethanol, before decreasing at higher sacrificial agent concentrations following the falling trend of hydrogen production. However, the concentration of acetic acid which is one or even two orders of magnitude lower, decreases with increasing initial concentration of the sacrificial agent. As can be seen in Figs. 4B and 5 , the production rate of the gaseous intermediates generally increases over time for low concentrations of the sacrificial agent. However, at 12.51M the increase in the production rate of CO2 slows down markedly and in the case of 100% (v/v) ethanol, the CO2 production rate can even be seen to reach a maximum before gradually decreasing. The latter instance is related to deactivation of the photocatalyst in the absence of water. Mineralization for ethanol is lower than that observed for methanol. When using ethanol, the lower production of CO2 as well as, in general, the lower hydrogen productions are due not only to differences in the adsorption capacities of the alcohols and their intermediates and to their better or worse performance as hole scavengers, but also to the formation of methane and ethane (which consume photogenerated hydrogen ions and electrons) which are produced in higher quantities in the case of ethanol. 3.2.3 Ethyleneglycol Fig. 6A shows how a maximum hydrogen production of 675.3μmolh−1 in the case of ethyleneglycol was attained at a concentration of 7.34M, corresponding to a hydrogen production in 3.5h of 1985.60μmol. The levels of hydrogen production observed for ethyleneglycol are even lower than those for ethanol. This does not concur with the observations of Fu et al. [57] who concluded after a study involving alcohols of three carbons that hydrogen production was greater when the number of OH groups was higher as the molecule with more OH groups is more efficient as a hole scavenger. In short, these results make it clear that the number of OH groups cannot be considered decisive in the comparison of activities of alcohols with the same number of carbon atoms. In this case, formaldehyde and formic acid were detected in the aqueous phase and were found to follow the same trend with respect to the sacrificial agent load as hydrogen production. Only CO2 was detected in the gaseous phase. Though other authors have reported finding methane [58], no traces of this substance were found in the present study. It can be seen how mineralization at low concentrations increases with the organic load but falls again at higher concentrations (Fig. 6B). In this case, the maximum mineralization values coincide with the maximum hydrogen production values and all the intermediates that were followed displayed a similar trend to that of hydrogen production. The highest CO2 values fall between the corresponding highest values for methanol and ethanol. The higher mineralization rates observed for ethyleneglycol compared to ethanol, despite the lower hydrogen production rates, are fundamentally due to the absence with ethyleneglycol of reduction products such as methane and ethane. Additionally, in this case no deactivation of the photocatalyst is observed when using a 100% (v/v) sacrificial agent. 3.2.4 Glycerol Due to glycerol's high viscosity it was not possible to obtain a 100% (v/v) of sacrificial agent and the highest tested concentration was 10.13M. Fig. 7A shows the results for hydrogen production. As with the ethanol and ethyleneglycol, maximum production was obtained for 7.34M, corresponding to 592.7μmolh−1 and 1663.03μmol in 3.5h. This was the lowest of the results obtained, due to glycerol being a larger molecule which limits its approach to the catalyst surface [21]. As glycerol is a more complex alcohol, a large number of intermediates can be formed. The formation of acetic acid, methanol, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, acetol, acetaldehyde, ethanol, glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, acetone and acrolein has been reported in the literature [21,59–61]. Using the methodologies employed in the present study, only formaldehyde was detected in the liquid phase. This intermediate displayed the same trend as hydrogen production and its concentrations were similar to those observed for ethyleneglycol (Fig. 7A). We only detected CO2 in the gaseous phase with no observations made of either CO, methane or ethane. As can be seen in Fig. 7B, the production rate of CO2 at the lowest concentrations of the sacrificial agent was high, reaching a value of 47μmolh−1. The highest mineralization was therefore observed for the lowest concentrations of sacrificial agent, with a maximum attained value of 78.28μmol for 4.00M. Mineralization fell sharply at higher concentrations of the sacrificial agent to a minimum value of 11.28μmoles of CO2 for 10.13M."
9,Catalyst reuse,"3.3 Catalyst reuse In order to test its reusability, or in other words its ability to maintain its photocatalytic activity in continuous use, the catalyst was subjected to different reuse cycles. A sacrificial agent load of 0.011M was used for these tests so that the hydrogen flow that was generated would attain a value of zero in an experimentally acceptable period of time. Fig. 8 shows the results obtained for the cases of methanol, ethyleneglycol and glycerol. A stable production from one cycle to the next of around 2400μmol can be observed in the case of methanol. The first cycle lasted 48h before mineralization of more than 90% of the initial sacrificial agent load, while the subsequent cycles took some 14h. For ethyleneglycol, a hydrogen flow of approximately 11μmolh−1 was still taking place 143h after initiation, and for glycerol a flow of 7μmolh−1 after 70.5h. According to Panagiotopoulou et al. [61] more than 300h would be required to eliminate the glycerol contained in 60mL of a 20mM aqueous solution of glycerol (110.5mg). The least reproducible cycles would appear to those of glycerol, with a notable variation in the production over the same time period. Most authors who have used organic pollutants as sacrificial agent have found that the hydrogen and CO2 production obtained in their tests can in practice be explained by considering only the photoreforming of the sacrificial agent [3,4,62,63]. In this respect and in accordance with Eq. (5) and the following equations: (14) C2H6O2 +2H2O→5H2 +2CO2 (15) C3H8O3 +3H2O→7H2 +3CO2 we find that 98.3% of the hydrogen stoichiometrically predicted by photoreforming of the initial sacrificial agent was obtained in the case of methanol, 75.0% in 143h with ethyleneglycol and 33.2% in 70.5h with glycerol. The formation of methane in the case of methanol is one of the reasons why 100% of the stoichiometrically predicted hydrogen is not attained. As methanol was therefore also the best sacrificial agent in reuse cycles, it was used in the comparison tests that were performed of the SG750 with two commercial catalysts that are widely used in photocatalysis, the Aeroxide TiO2 P25 and the Hombikat UV-100. The P25 has a surface area of 47m2 g−1 and an anatase/rutile ratio of 79:19, while the Hombikat UV-100 is a 100% anatase photocatalyst with a very large surface area of 202m2 g−1. It can be seen in Fig. 9 how both catalysts achieve hydrogen productions close to the global balance of photoreforming of the methanol. In terms of cycle times, we find that with P25 they are similar to those of the SG750 from the second cycle onwards, between 13 and 14h. As was the case with the SG750, the first P25 cycle was longer than the others, though in this case 22h as opposed to 48h for the SG750. The cycles were somewhat longer with the Hombikat, all of them taking around 19h. When considering CO2 production, the values of between 600 and 700μmol that were obtained (not shown) are very close to meeting the mass balance expressed in the equations [Eq. (5)], especially when noting that in some cases there remains 3.7% of initial TOC in solution, which would be the equivalent of approximately 75μmol of CO2."
10,Conclusions,"The results for the SG750-2.1wt% catalyst are comparable in terms of activity and reusability to those obtained for the reference commercial catalysts, the Aeroxide TiO2 P25 and the Hombikat UV-100, whose surface areas are respectively 2.6 and 11.2 times larger than that of the SG750. In general, the best results were those obtained using methanol as hole scavenger, followed by ethanol, ethyleneglycol and glycerol. Hydrogen production was higher with ethanol than with methanol at low concentrations where an indirect oxidation mechanism was predominant due to the important presence of water. The reason for this may lie in the different adsorption capacities of the intermediates generated in the two alcohols. At higher concentrations, where the predominant mechanism was direct oxidation, methanol gave the better results as it is the better hole scavenger. For the first time the generation of ethane is reported in the photocatalytic reforming of ethanol. The formation of methane and ethane in significant quantities in the case of ethanol also results in decreased efficiency in hydrogen production of this hole scavenger as in both processes photogenerated H+ and electrons are consumed. The largest hydrogen production attained of 1134.08μmolh−1 or 15.12mmolh−1 g−1 is one of the highest one reported in recent studies [4,31,39]. In addition, the kinetics for aqueous methanol solutions with mole fraction <0.69 adequately fit the L–H model. The hydrogen produced by methanol photoreforming is practically the equivalent of that predicted by the stoichiometry of the reaction, with methane only being produced at trace levels in the case of this alcohol."
