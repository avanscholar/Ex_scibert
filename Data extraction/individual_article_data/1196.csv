0,Introduction,"Finding new and sustainable sources of energy is one of the most stressing needs for humanity. With the expected depletion of fossil fuels in a few decades from now, other sources of energy are needed. Ideally, these sources of energy need to be sustainable. Among the clean sources of energy, those involving molecular hydrogen are regarded as one of the most suitable. However, there is no natural sources of molecular hydrogen, in other words all hydrogen atoms in nature exist associated with other atoms, such in water, hydrocarbons, etc. Hydrogen can thus be produced from chemical compounds, but its production is challenged by thermodynamic laws, since it is produced as an energy source! Yet, suitable hydrogen producing sources are studied in the hope of finding the most efficient (or least deficient) ways. Among the most promising sources of hydrogen is ethanol, since it is obtained by fermentation of crops and is thus regarded as a bio-renewable source. This source is particularly attractive because the overall production of the inevitable by-product, CO2, is near zero (since most of the CO2 released would be of biological origin and is thus expected to be recycled in the eco-system). One may consider two distinct catalytic systems for making hydrogen from ethanol. One in dark conditions where the energy needed to break the ethanol molecule is heat [1–7], while the other is under photo illumination where the energy is “ideally” provided from the sun [8,9]. The latter one is obviously very attractive because a considerable amount of energy reaches the surface of the earth from the sun; most of it is left unused. We have studied the dark catalytic reactions of ethanol over a series of catalysts based on CeO2 and have found that the bottleneck of the reaction is in the breaking of the carboncarbon bond of the ethanol molecule [2–4]. It was also found that the reaction is most likely occurring at the interface between the metal and the support. Although, photo-catalytic reactions are inherently different from dark-catalytic reactions, it is important to compare their relative activity for the same reaction to assess for future directions. In this work, hydrogen production from ethanol is investigated on a series of metals deposited on the n-type semiconductor TiO2 anatase. TiO2 is the most active natural semiconductor known for photoreactions [10–12]. The metals considered in the work are Pd, Pt and Rh. There are at least three important properties that a metal should possess in order to be considered for this photo-catalytic process. (1) The metal needs to act as an efficient electron trap in order to decrease the electron–hole recombination rate upon photo-excitation. (2) It needs to be efficient for H(a)–H(a) recombination ((a) for adsorbed). (3) It should not be easily oxidized during the process. The ethanol molecule is itself a “hole” trap, where the adsorbed molecule becomes a radical ethoxide under UV irradiation [13], which is then converted to the carbonyl compound. Scheme 1 summarises the photo-catalytic excitation process of an M/TiO2 catalyst in presence of ethanol."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The supported metal photo-catalysts employed in the present study were prepared by adding Pt, Pd and Rh ions to TiO2 anatase powder to form 1wt% Pt, 1wt% Pd and 1wt% Rh titania samples (bulk ratios). These catalysts were prepared by impregnation of TiO2 anatase powder (10g) with M x+/HCl solution (Pt4+ 0.103g/100mL, Pd2+ 0.1g/150Ml, Rh3+ 0.1g/250mL) to obtain metal loading of 1wt%. The following precursors were used: RhCl3·3H2O, PdCl2 and PtCl4. The slurry was then heated at 100°C, while stirring for few hours until it becomes a paste. The paste is then dried at 150°C overnight followed by calcination at 350°C for 4h in air. We have opted to work on a pure anatase TiO2 (from British Drug Houses LTD.). The relatively low BET surface (11m2/g) is large enough to allow for well-dispersed metals at low loading close to 1wt%, in general."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The surface areas of all catalysts were determined by the three points BET method with di-nitrogen at 77K, using a Quantasorb instrument. The band-gap of the catalysts was determined using the UV–vis technique performed with a Shimadzu double-beam UV-2100 spectrophotometer. Surface analysis was conducted by XPS using a KRATOS XSAM-800 model with an operating base pressure of ca. 10−9 Torr. The X-rays, from Al Kα (hν =1486.6eV) radiation, were used at 180W. Collection of spectra was performed at a pass energy of 20eV. Binding energies were calibrated with respect to the signal of adventitious carbon (binding energy at 284.7eV). The following regions were scanned: Ti (2p), O (1s), C (1s) and Rh (3d), or Pd (3d) or Pt (4f). Pd and Pt were found mainly in the metallic form while Rh is composed of Rh metal and Rh3+ ions. It was also found that the O to Ti ratios were less than 2 in the case of Pt and Pd and above 2 for Rh. XRD was conducted on all catalysts. The TiO2 (calcined at 350°C for 4h) used is a 100% anatase as evidenced by the sharp lines at 2θ =25.4 attributed to the 101 phase and the absence of the characteristic line 2θ =27.6 of the 110 phase of rutile TiO2. TEM experiments were performed using a Philips CM12 providing an accelerating voltage in the 20–120kV and magnification between 30 and 600k×. Samples were prepared by embedding in EM-Bed 812 epoxy resin, which was polymerised into a plastic block at 330K for 48h. Sections of an approximate thickness of 50nm were prepared. Table 1 summarises the BET, UV–vis and XPS data."
4,Catalytic reactions,"2.3 Catalytic reactions One hundred millilitre of Ethanol and 0.5g of the catalyst were placed into a quartz photo-reactor (volume=397mL). Purging to remove dissolved O2 was conducted using a flow of dry N2 gas into the reactor for 30min prior to illumination. All reactions were carried out under magnetic stirring (speed=1500rotation/min). A 100W ultraviolet Hg lamp (H 144GC-100, Sylvania Par 38) was used as a light source. The flux of photon from UV lamp was measured by actinometry, it is found close to 1017 photons/cm2 s about 20cm away from the lamp without the cut-off filter (250nm and above) and 1015 with the cut off filter (360nm and above). Gas samples (0.5mL) were removed from the reactor at different time intervals and analysed using two TCD gas chromatographs (Shimadzu) equipped with a packed Porapak Q column for hydrogen, CO2 and water and a FID gas chromatograph (Pye Unicom) also equipped with a packed Porapak Q column for hydrocarbons. CO was analysed using a TCD equipped with a molecular sieve column 5A. Hydrogen produced was quantitatively analysed using an external standard in the same concentration range; molecular oxygen was not detected."
5,Results and discussion,"One of the main targets of this work is to test for hydrogen production from ethanol on the metal/TiO2 catalysts. Only negligible hydrogen production has been seen from the TiO2 alone showing that hydrogen ion reduction and hydrogen–hydrogen recombination are very weak on the bare TiO2 surface. Fig. 1 shows the production of hydrogen as a function time for the three catalysts. While Pd and Pt/TiO2 catalysts are found active the Rh/TiO2 was far weaker. There is no sign of catalyst deactivation within the time frame of the study. All catalysts show, however, an induction period. This is probably due to complete reduction of the metals made by the production of hydrogen under UV. We have repeated several times the experiments and in general, found that all catalysts needed an induction period. In addition to hydrogen, acetaldehyde was also quantitatively analysed. Its concentration was, however, about 10 times smaller than that of hydrogen. This indicated that some of acetaldehyde is converted to CO and CH4, both products were also detected but again their concentration was far smaller than that of hydrogen. This observation was previously reported in a work related to hydrogen production from an ethanol/water solution [15]. The main exception is in the formation of acetic acid (in their work) rather than acetaldehyde: presumably by acetaldehyde further reaction with water. Although, we have not studied in details the effect of metal loading on the photo-catalytic production of hydrogen from ethanol, we have conducted similar experiments with 0.5wt% Pd/TiO2 and found that the rate of reaction has decreased by about three to four times when compared to that of 1wt% Pd/TiO2. The weak production of hydrogen on Rh/TiO2 is not due to low metal dispersion, since TEM pictures show small particles of Rh, on average smaller than 10nm in diameter (Fig. 2 ). Actually, the mean particle size of Rh particles is found smaller than that of the Pd particles, yet the latter is over one order of magnitude, more active at 300K. Moreover, the atomic% of Rh on the catalyst is as high as that of Pd or Pt. The weak production of hydrogen may be either due to weak electron trapping capability of Rh metal when compared to Pt or Pd or to the fact that a large fraction of Rh particles are non-metallic. Some evidence from ex situ XPS analysis of the fresh catalysts suggests that the reason might be due to an efficient oxygen transfer from the support (TiO2) to the metal. Fig. 3 shows this in some details. The Ti 2p3/2 of TiO2 in Rh/TiO2 is compared to that of a TiO2 alone. There is evidence of reduced states of Ti ions in the case of Rh/TiO2. Ti3+ line position is expected at about 457.5eV while that of Ti4+ (the dominant peak) is at 459eV. This behaviour is not seen in the ex situ XPS analysis for Pt/TiO2 or Pd/TiO2. Moreover, while XPS Pt 4f or XPS Pd 3d (see inset of Fig. 3) show predominantly metallic states that of Rh 3d shows the presence of non-negligible amount of Rh ions. An estimate of the possible reduction of the different ions can be given from their reduction potential (versus the standard hydrogen electrode, SHE): the reduction of Pt2+ (or Pd2+) ions to Pt (or Pd) metals is more favoured than that of Rh2+ to Rh (1.18, 0.95 and 0.6V for Pt2+, Pd2+ and Rh2+, respectively) [15a]. Moreover, Rh2O3, if present, is a p-type semiconductor with a low electron affinity [16]. Its formation may, thus be the reason behind its unexpectedly low activity. Although, ex situ analysis cannot provide direct information related to the state of the catalyst in operation the observation is nevertheless worth considering. The same reaction was also conducted over a bimetallic catalyst containing Rh and Pt (Fig. 1). The bimetallic catalyst was far weaker than the monometallic Pt/TiO2 with the same total loading. The six times decrease is not justified on the basis of the decreasing of Pt loading and points to a far more dramatic effect of Rh on the reaction. The effect of mild heating up to 80°C for all catalysts is given in Fig. 4(a–c). The two most active catalysts Pd and Pt/TiO2 showed small dependency on reaction temperature when compared to the least active catalyst (Rh/TiO2). The activation energy for the reaction can be computed from the slope of ln(rate) as a function of 1/T (K−1) from Fig. 4(a–c), and is given in Table 2 . By 80°C, Rh/TiO2 is about two times less active than Pt/TiO2 or Pd/TiO2. In principle, one can carry the reaction at 70–80°C (close to the boiling point of ethanol) without using further energy, provided that heat from the sun is efficiently captured. It is unlikely that the slight heating has changed the nature and structure of the metallic particles but it is not impossible that some Rh2O3 particles have been reduced by hydrogen (the reaction product) to metallic particles. The above results show that in the photo-catalytic reduction of ethanol the nature of the interface between the metal and the support is crucial; as it is the case in dark catalytic reactions [17,18]. As seen in Scheme 1, the electron donation to the valence band by ethanol and the electron capture in the conduction band by the metal will be most efficient if they are conducted by adjacent sites (avoiding or minimizing diffusion and side reactions). In principle, ethanol is preferentially adsorbed on the TiO2 surface rather than on the metal surface: this is mainly due to the stronger heat of adsorption of oxide when compared to that on metals. For example, surface science results of TiO2 and Pd single crystals show that the desorption of ethanol [19] or acetaldehyde [20] is far lower on the metal [19,20] than it is on the TiO2 support [21,22]. DFT computation for the adsorption of ethanol on Pt(111) surface gives energy in the order of 1eV (1eV is ca. 96.5kJmol−1) [23]. We are not aware of DFT computation for ethanol adsorption over TiO2 but semi-empirical PM3 computation gave adsorption energy close to 1.5eV [24]. However, for an efficient reaction to occur the adsorption site should be at the interface between the metal and the support as presented in Scheme 2 . In order to further understand the reaction of ethanol on M/TiO2, it was worth comparing the production of hydrogen from ethanol to that of other alcohols. The first step of the reaction is the dissociative adsorption of the alcohol over a pair of Ti and O on the surface as follow: (1) R–O–H(a)+Ti(s)–O(s)→R–O–Ti(s)+H–O(s) where (a) is adsorbed and (s) is surface. In other words, changing R should have an effect on the adsorption equilibrium. In that regard, experiments were conducted with methanol, n-propanol, i-propanol and n-butanol in addition to ethanol under photon irradiation over Pt/TiO2 and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . While both methanol and ethanol were found of similar activity, C3 and C4 alcohols showed considerably lower production of molecular hydrogen. As solvent properties can substantially affect the electron transfer kinetics, we have attempted to correlate the rate of the reaction of these alcohols over 1wt% Pt/TiO2 with their polarity [25–27] defined as follow. Solvent polarity, Y (2) Y = ε s − 1 ε s + 2 where ɛ s is the relative solvent permittivity. The results are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 6 . There is clearly a relationship between the rate of H2 production and the solvent polarity (a similar trend is seen if one plots the rate as a function of solvent polarizability). Thus, the dissociative adsorption (H abstraction from the alcohol function onto surface oxygen atoms) over Pt/TiO2 surface is governing the reaction. In other words, the initial process is following an acid–base type of interaction as given in Eq. (1)."
6,Conclusions,"Hydrogen production from ethanol has been studied on a series of TiO2 anatase catalysts. Both Pd and Pt deposited on TiO2 show a strong activity with a quantum yield of about 10% at 350K. On the contrary, Rh/TiO2 does not appear to be as active. The reasons behind this are not due to a poor metal dispersion but due to the contact between the metal particle and the titanium oxide support. It is likely that Rh2O3 particles are still present, since XPS Rh 3d shows the presence of Rh ions that can be attributed to Rh3+. The reaction is mainly governed by the formation of the surface ethoxide and hydroxyl formed by dissociative adsorption at the interface between the Pt (or Pd) metal particles and TiO2 (Scheme 2). At the interface, hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl are easily reduced by electrons from the metal particles while the ethoxide species act as hole traps. Extension of the reaction with other alcohols verified this initial step, since in the series methanol to butanol, hydrogen production is reasonably following the polarity of these alcohols. Although, 10% efficiency in the UV region is still far from any practical application involving direct excitation from sun light, the results are nevertheless promising and may stimulate farther studies in particular with regard to the metal/metal oxide interface on the splitting of hydrogen atoms from ethanol."
