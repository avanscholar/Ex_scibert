0,Introduction,"Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water to produce hydrogen energy is regarded as a very promising method to simultaneously solve the problems of increasing resource consumption and gradually worsened environment pollution [1,2]. However, the poor electrocatalyst performance directly hinders the efficiency of whole water splitting. Platinum based materials are known as the highest efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts [3]. Unfortunately, the high cost and limited resources of Pt limit their large-scale commercial applications for water electrolysis. To fully realize the viability of water electrolyzer, developing earth-abundant transition metal-based candidates with high HER electrocatalytic activity and stability especially under high current density is regarded as a highly desirable alternative. Electrode material selection is primarily determinant to electrocatalytic performance of transition metals. Recently, much attention has been paid on Ni-based electrocatalysts due to the fact that the H atom binding energy of Ni is close to that of Pt according to the calculation results of density function theory [4], moreover, Ni is naturally abundant and easy to synthesize. While, Ni particles synthesized by the traditional pyrolysis methods unavoidably suffer from severe agglomeration, grain coarsening and atoms rearrange due to excess progressing time, directly leading to the low surface-to-volume ratio and less surface defects. Consequently, the number of active sites for coarsened Ni particles are far from enough, meaning their rather poor electrocatalytic performance. In this regard, it is highly essential to boost electrocatalytic activity by introducing more structural defects. Reducing the grain size of Ni particles is one of the most feasible ways to increase defects density, namely, grain surface density. What is more interesting, twin boundaries (TBs) have been proved as one of the most effective defects to activate the electrocatalysts surface, which could not only import extra surface edges, corners, steps and jaggies, but also bring in surface strain into the electrocatalysts [5]. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop new methods to introduce twins into the grains. Until now, there has no available method to largely increase defects density in Ni-based catalysts, especially for TBs. Moreover, the rational design of electrode structure with abundant diffusion channels for H2 and electrolyte, as well as robust substrate for Ni uniform distribution is closely related to long-term stability, which is another key factor restricting commercial application of Ni-based electrocatalysts. It has been widely reported that strong bubbles evolution during H2 production will exert a large shear stress to the electrode, which could cause severe detachment of electrocatalysts from substrates, especially at high current density [6]. Choosing a proper supporting material to synthesize three dimensional (3D) electrocatalysts with hollow or porous structure is a feasible way to solve the above problems. As known, fiber-like high molecular compounds, including non-woven cloth, electrospinning fibers, wet tissue fibers, cotton fibers, facial mask fibers and medical mask fibers, usually have regularly columned structure and can be completely decomposed hardly with residue through heat treatment. In another word, all of these fibers can be regarded as excellent template materials for growing catalysts. In consideration that a huge number of dumped masks have been produced in recent years due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Especially, medical masks have become important daily necessities. Moreover, these masks are discarded casually and the disposal of wasted masks has become a challenge. Unfortunately, far not enough attentions have been paid on solving these problems. Therefore, mask fibers (MFs) are expected to be employed as an outstanding representative of template materials, which could also help to make full use of their surplus value and decrease their pollution to environment. In this work, MFs are innovatively used as template, reducing agent and carbon resource to fully interact with Ni. Consequently, a new type of microtube-like electrocatalyst composed of carbon sheets and Ni nanoparticles is successfully synthesized by the heat and cool shock calcination. Meanwhile, the density of defects (eg. grain surface, twin boundaries, stack faults, surface steps and lattice distortion) can be controlled by adjusting heating and cooling methods as well as calcination time. Therefore, the dynamics of HER process could be significantly accelerated by the generated strain effects and high surface energy through defects. In addition, the Ni nanoparticles wrapped by few-layer graphene are uniformly fixed on the carbon network of microtubes, which could improve the stability by providing abundant diffusion channels for H2 and electrolyte and avoid Ni grains being peeled off under the turbulent flow of violent bubbles. By the virtue of these remarkable features, the as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits prominently improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for HER."
1,Experimental section,"Experimental section: All the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and hexamethylenetetramine (HTM) were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent. Absolute ethanol, HCl and acetone were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent. Mask fibers (MFs) were taken from the commonly used commercial masks. MFs were repeatedly immersed in 70 % ethanol for 24.0 h and dried at 100 °C for 24.0 h and then cut into 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm pieces. Through this process, as well known, bacteria and virus (novel coronavirus) can be removed by 70 % ethanol. After successive ultrasonication in 1.0 mol L-1 HCl, acetone and deionized water for 30.0 min in each solution, MFs were dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight. Whereafter, 3.4896 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (12.0 mmol) and 2.5232 g HMT (18.0 mmol) were dissolved in the mixed solution of 40.0 mL deionized water and 20.0 mL absolute ethanol. After magnetic stirring at room temperature for 20.0 min, 1.4 g of the above treated MFs (about 255 pieces) were added into the above solution and kept immersion for 20.0 min under ultrasonication to fully wet MFs. Then, the mixture was transferred into 100.0 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 90 °C for 6.0 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the MFs coated with baby blue precursors were taken out from solution, washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol to remove residual precursors and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C. After that, the precursors were pyrolyzed at 800 °C for different time with different heating and cooling rate in the atmosphere of N2. The corresponding samples were denoted as Ni-X-R and Ni-X-N, where X represented the heating insulation time (min), R represented the rapid heating and cooling rate (heat and cool shock) and N represented the normal heating and cooling rate (3 °C min−1 heating rate and cooling with the cooling rate of tubular furnace), respectively. Characterization: The phase composition and crystal structure were studied by a D-MAX 2200 VPC X-ray diffraction equipped with Cu Kα radiation (30 kV, 30 mA). The microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI, Quanta 200F FESE, 20 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100F HRTEM, 200 kV; FEI, TECNAI F30 HRTEM, 300 kV, JEOL-ARM200F HRTEM, 200 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermal Fisher Scientific, US) was performed to analyze the surface species and chemical states of the samples. The surface areas and porous properties were measured by the standard nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at -196 °C using an automated micropore gas analyzer ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics Instruments). Raman spectra was investigated by the aid of a HORIBA Jobin Yvon, LabRam HR800 laser co-focal micro-spectrometry spectrograph with wavelength of 633 nm. Electrochemical measurements: The substrates of working electrode were carbon cloth (CC) and carbon paper (CP) with area of 1.0 cm × 1.2 cm. CC and CP were successively treated with acetone and ethyl alcohol under ultrasonic treatment for 5.0 min, respectively, and then dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 12.0 h. To prepare working electrode, 5.0 mg catalyst powders, 400.0 µL deionized water, 50.0 µL Nafion® solution (5 wt%) and 550.0 µL isopropyl alcohol were added into a 2.0 mL centrifuge tubular. Then the catalyst slurry was ultrasonicated in an ice bath. After ultrasonication for 30.0 min, the slurry was brushed onto the above treated CC and CP. The catalyst mass loading was 0.875 mg cm−2. After dried at 60 °C for 10.0 min, the working electrode was obtained. Specially, the electrocatalysts loaded on CP were applied for stability tests. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out on AutoLab Electrochemical Workstation in 1.0 M KOH at room temperature with Ag/AgCl as reference electrode and graphite sheet as counter electrode, respectively. The EIS measurements were performed in a frequency range from 10-2 to 105 Hz at a potential of −100 mV (vs. RHE) with an amplitude of 5 mV."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Characterizations,"3.1 Characterizations As shown in Fig. 1 a, the baby blue precursors were synthesized by traditional hydrothermal reactions with Mask Fibers (MFs) as templates and hexamethylenetetramine simultaneously as both structure guider and pH buffer. Then the obtained precursors@MFs need to be calcinated into final product. It has been reported that the calcination with rapid heating and cooling rate is helpful to keep fine grains, produce defects and introduce strain, which could promote the adsorption ability of OH– and improve electrocatalytic activity [7,8]. Generally speaking, the highest heating rate that the traditional tubular furnace can suffer is less than 15 °C min−1 according to the user manual. In order to break through this heating and cooling rate limit, the commercial solution takes advantage of the relative movement between furnace body and quartz tube to obtain rapid heating and cooling rate, as shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information). During calcination (Fig. S1b, Supporting Information), a quartz ark filled with samples is firstly placed in the room temperature area while the tubular furnace is heated to high temperature (800 °C here). After the temperature increasing to the pre-set value, the furnace body with high temperature was moved to the room temperature area of quartz tube to make samples heated rapidly. After keeping at this temperature for certain time, the furnace body is moved to the original area of quartz tube to make the sample cool down with high rate. Obviously, the heat will be transferred between samples and heat or cool resource unavoidably with quartz tube as the main transfer media. Consequently, the real heating and cooling rate of samples calcinated by this technology is generally slower than that of quartz tube. In this work, the optimized tubular furnace is developed to further break down the limit of quartz tube, as shown in Fig. S2 (Supporting Information). Different from the commercial tubular furnace, the only movement for the optimized tubular furnace is the quartz ark filled with samples. Therefore, the samples will suffer from drastically heat and cool shock. Undoubtedly, this optimized technology can reach the highest heating and cooling rate, which is infinitely close to theoretical rate and only limited by the thermal conductivity of samples. Meanwhile, big temperature difference is the key for heat and cool shock. This kind of shock can cause significant composition and expansion difference inside and outside of grains, which are the resource of stress. As known, only this stress reaches to a certain value (higher than elastic limit), plastic deformation (twinning) can occur to release this stress. Therefore, big temperature difference is essential to trigger this deformation. In addition, calcination temperature directly affects the graphitization degree of carbon, which is due to the fact that the transformation temperature of amorphous carbon to graphitized carbon with Ni catalysis is at least above 600 °C [9]. However, fast kinetics caused by too high temperature also promotes excessive growth of Ni nanoparticles, leading to decrease of exposed area for defects, which will significantly reduce the activity of HER. Comprehensively considering above advantages and disadvantages, the calcination temperature in this study is chosen as 800 °C. After hydrothermal reactions, the formed precursors are mainly composed of Ni, C, O and N elements according to the EDS result as shown in Fig. S3a (Supporting Information). Further combined with the XRD result (Fig. S3b, Supporting Information), it can be obviously observed that the diffraction peaks of precursors agree well with those of NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O [10]. After calcination under high temperature (800 °C) with different calcination modes, the XRD patterns of obtained Ni-X-N and Ni-X-R (X represents the heating insulation time, R represents the rapid heating and cooling rate and N represents the normal heating and cooling rate.) are shown in Fig. 1b-c. Meanwhile, XRD was also performed out to confirm phase structure of intermediate products for Ni-X-N and Ni-X-R. Briefly, precursors@MFs were pyrolyzed at middle temperature (400 °C) for 2.0 h with normal heating and cooling rate, which was named as Ni-120-N-400, as shown in Fig. S4a (Supporting Information). As can be seen, all samples pyrolyzed under high temperature (Ni-X-R and Ni-X-N) are typical metallic phase, which is the same as the standard diffraction peaks of metal Ni (PDF#70–0989) with lattice parameters of a = b = c = 3.516 Å, α = β = 90°. But for the XRD patterns of Ni-1-R (Figs. S4b-d, Supporting Information), it has more dispersed peaks with bigger full width at half maximum (FWHM), lower Peak height/Peak area ratio and more complex carbon peaks due to worse crystallinity and inadequately decomposition. In addition, the XRD peaks of intermediate products (Ni-120-N-400) are assigned to NiO (PDF#71–1179) with lattice parameters of a = b = c = 4.178 Å, α = β = 90°. Actually, medical masks are usually tailored by three layers of different fibers (Fig. S5, Supporting Information). Both of outer layer and inner layer are non-woven cloth. The middle layer is woven by ultrafine polypropylene fibers, which is also named as melt-blown fabric. It can be seen from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. S6 (Supporting Information) that each layer of MFs is composed of uniformly distributed and columned fibers with diameters of about 11.2, 5.7 and 24.0 μm for inner, middle and out layer, respectively. Then roughly hydrothermal reactions were carried out to identify whether MFs could be acted as the substrate for nucleation of NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O precursors. According to the corresponding SEM characterizations in Fig. S7 (Supporting Information) and Fig. 2 a-b, all layers of MFs are uniformly and densely covered with a layer of precursor nanosheets, indicating that MFs are indeed proper substrates except the different size. In order to study the whole details of electrocatalysts preparation and tests, the inner layer of MFs is chosen as the typical example for further experiments. Meanwhile, in order to obtain clear surface with excellent absorbability and hydrophilicity, MFs are repeatedly treated with 70 % ethanol, 1.0 M HCl, acetone, and deionized water to remove adsorbed bacteria, virus and residues [11]. Then transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) tests were carried out to characterize the detailed structure of NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O precursors. Obviously, the 2D NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O nanosheets have a pleat-like structure of graphene with uniform elemental distribution, as shown in Fig. 2c-d. Further enlarged images (Fig. 2e-f) show that NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O precursors are actually stacked by ultrathin nanosheets with about 15 layers [12]. Meanwhile, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) spectra (inset of Fig. 2e) are composed of several concentric rings, indicating that NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O has typical polycrystal structure. In order to explore the most proper synthesis method, further calcination was carried out at 800 °C for different time with normal and rapid heating and cooling rate. After calcination, the samples present remarkable different morphology. The SEM images in Fig. 2g-l show that both Ni-5-N and Ni-5-R have microtubular structure composed of nanosheet arrays. What’s different is that a large number of coarse grains can be obviously observed on the surface of nanosheets for Ni-5-N. Meanwhile, Ni-1-N, Ni-1-R, Ni-30-R, Ni-60-R, Ni-120-R and Ni-240-R (Fig. S8, Supporting Information) also keep the similar nanosheet-array-like and microtubular structure. While for other samples (Ni-30-N, Ni-60-N, Ni-120-N and Ni-240-N), the nanosheet-array-like structure on the surface of microtubes has been completely broken with a large number of anomalously grown grains on the surface. In addition, all of the EDS (Fig. 2i, l, Fig. S9, Supporting Information) show the presence of C and Ni elements as the main components, indicating that NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O precursors have been completely decomposed and reduced into Ni by carbon in MFs as reducing agent. Meanwhile, there still exists some O, which comes from oxygen-containing functional groups of carbon sheets. Then TEM characterization was conducted to compare the crystal structure and grain size of samples. As shown in Fig. 3 a-b, an ultra-small average grain size of ∼ 12.8 nm can be obtained in Ni-5-R. Notably, there is a large number of grains in Ni-5-R, which shows the characteristic of stripes with alternate bright and dark contrast, as highlighted by the red circles. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization was further conducted to make it clearer. As shown in Fig. 3c, the lattice fringes exhibit clearly mirrored orientation relationship along {111} crystal plane under 〈011〉 zone axis, and these stripes are found {111} twins in fcc Ni crystal. The (11 1 ¯ ) twin boundaries (TBs) are marked by white lines, and (1 1 ¯ 1) planes are labelled by cyan line and red line in twin and matrix, respectively. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) is shown in Fig. 3d. The streaking (elongation line near diffraction spots) is related to stacking faults (SFs), as also indicated in Fig. 3c and Fig. S10a (Supporting Information) [13]. It is worth noting that the twins take habit plane of {111} and they can only be apparent when the zone axis is close to 〈011〉, which bring huge challenge for TBs observation. Undoubtedly, the actual twin quantity for Ni-5-R is believed higher than the current observed quantity. In comparison, Ni-5-N sample possesses significantly larger grain size of ∼ 43.3 nm, as shown in Fig. 3e-f. It is well known that the ratio of surface to volume of particles is negatively related with the radius according to Equation (1). (1) Surface Volume = 4 π r 2 4 3 π r 3 = 3 r here r is the radius of sphere mode. Namely, the surface-to-volume ratio of Ni-5-N is significantly lower than Ni-5-R samples. The twin quantity of Ni-5-N is also obviously lower than that of Ni-5-R. Moreover, most of twinning occurs in coarse grains for Ni-5-N, in which the twinning habit planes are not uniform. Therefore, high-fold twins (even penta-twin) are more prevalent. The HRTEM and corresponding FFT in Fig. 3g-h demonstrate a typical penta-twin twin in a coarse grain. It is noticed that the conjuction of penta-twin is located at the corner in most of grains (Figs. S10b-c, Supporting Information), namely, inspite of the high-order twining, the overall TB density is rather low. From the above analysis, the heat and cool shock calcination mode adopted in present investigation successfully brings in high defects density. It is reported that TBs play a significant role in catalysis fields due to that they can expose a large number of atoms with high surface energy, which effectively improve absorption ability and increase active sites of catalysts [13-16]. More significant, introducing TBs into nanomaterials is also an important way to tune and control the surface strain of catalysts, which has been proved as an effective way to control the downshift of d band center closely related with the weakening of interaction [5]. As shown in Fig. 3i-k, the geometric phase analysis (GPA) images show the obvious existence of compressive strain caused by lattice distortion, especially along the interface of TBs and SFs. Meanwhile, a large number of surface defects, including grain surface, periodical lattice mismatch, surface steps, corners, edges and jaggies induced by ultrafine grains, TBs and SFs (just shown in HAADF-STEM images of Fig. 4 a-b), are also helpful to expose more atoms with high surface energy, which means that the potential barriers of electrocatalytic reactions can be further reduced and the active sites can be further increased through defect engineering [5,17,18]. As a contrast, both the surface-to-volume ration and TB density in Ni-5-N are greatly lower than that of Ni-5-R, which means the lower exposure ratio of defects for Ni-5-N, directly leading to a poor HER efficiency (as discussed below). The same trend can be observed in samples with different heating insulation time, i.e. Ni-X-R has obviously smaller average grain size and more TBs than Ni-X-N (Fig. S11, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. S12a (Supporting Information), the average grain size is roughly positively correlated with heating insulation time. As the typical representative of main defects, a rough quantity statistics of TBs in TEM images with the same scale bar have has been carried out (Fig. S12b, Supporting Information). Obviously, the quantity of TBs is roughly negatively correlated with heating insulation time (besides the inadequately decomposed Ni-1-R). As can be seen, the density of defects is successfully controlled by different heating and cooling methods and different heating insulation time. In addition, the HAADF-STEM images of Ni-5-R (Fig. 4c, d, f) clearly show that ultrafine Ni grains are uniformly distributed in carbon sheets of carbon microtubes without any agglomeration, proving the effective wrapping and fixation of carbon layer to Ni. Meanwhile, the EDS elemental mapping images (Fig. 4e, g-k) also prove the characterizations of uniform composition and integrated structure. Further analyzing the grain surface of Ni-5-N and Ni-5-R in Fig. 3 and Fig. S13 (Supporting Information), it can be clearly seen that Ni nanocrystals have been wrapped by few-layer graphene and fixed on the surface of carbon sheets. That is due to the fact that amorphous carbon can easily transfer to order graphene layers with the catalysis of metallic Ni [9]. Then Raman spectra were obtained to deeply investigate the carbon structure. As can be seen in Fig. 5 a-c, both Raman spectra of Ni-5-N and Ni-5-R can be well fitted into four Lorentzian-shaped bands (G, D1, D2, D4) located at about 1585.3, 1337.2, 1619.3, and 1181.7 cm−1, respectively, as well as a Gaussian-shaped band (D3) located at about 1500.6 cm−1 [19]. The D-band corresponds to the carbon (C-sp2) atoms in the rings, which indicates the disorder within graphitic lattice. And the G-band indicates the in-plane bond stretching motion in C–C sp2 atoms, which reflects the ideal graphitic lattice [19,20]. Especially, the ID/IG ratio is often used as an indicator reflecting the graphitization degree. Obviously, Ni-5-R has lower (ID1 + ID2 + ID3 + ID4)/IG ratio and higher FWHM of G-band than those of Ni-5-N, indicating its higher graphitization degree. The more ordered carbon structure could undoubtedly provide more superexcellent conductive-network for electrocatalysts. This conductive network is especially useful to Ni-5-R, which has the finest Ni grains and can maximize the advantages of carbon layers. If further processing Raman curves just according to the ratio of two peaks intensity (ID/IG) to reflect graphitization degree as reported in many references about carbonization of biomass materials, the graphitization degree of Ni-5-R is clearly superior to that of references (Fig. S14 and Table S1, Supporting Information). Similar carbon sheets can be also seen for Ni-X-N and Ni-X-R (Fig. S11, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, Ni-X-R has lower ID/IG ratio and higher FWHM of G-band (Fig. S15, Supporting Information). Therefore, it can be concluded that this heat and cool shock method is indeed benefited to optimize carbon structure. In order to deeply study the formation mechanism of TBs, further theoretical analysis has been tentatively made for the typical Ni-5-R and Ni-5-N. During calcination, NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O precursors are firstly pyrolyzed into NiO and then NiO will be reduced into Ni by carbon decomposed from MFs. While, different samples with different heating and cooling modes will undergo remarkable different reaction process. For Ni-5-R, all reactions occur too quickly and fiercely, leading to that almost all reactions, including the carbonization of MFs, the decomposition of NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O precursors into NiO and the reduction of NiO into metallic Ni, mainly occur in high temperature range. During the heat shock process of Ni-5-R, the oxygen-rich surface of NiO will be firstly reduced by carbon and transform into oxygen-poor surface. Whereafter, the O atoms of inner NiO will consecutively diffuse onto the surface of NiO to combine with C atoms driven by the oxygen gradient between inside and surface, as well as the faster diffusion rate and the smaller atomic radius of oxygen than nickel, which can be interpreted by Kirkendall effect [21,22]. As a result, the inside of NiO will gradually transforms into metallic Ni and large lattice mismatch will be produced at the interface between Ni and NiO. So it is very necessary to calculate the strain state at the interface. According to the standard PDF card in Tables S2 and S3 (Supporting Information), the strongest diffraction peaks of metallic Ni and NiO are Ni (111) and NiO (200), which have lattice distance of 2.035 and 2.089 Å, respectively. So the theoretical lattice strain for Ni and NiO to suffer on the interface can be calculated according to Equations (2) and (3): (2) ε 1 = d 1 - d 2 d 1 (3) ε 2 = d 1 - d 2 d 2 Here, ε 1 represents the strain for metallic Ni suffered at the interface, d 1 represents the crystal distance of metallic Ni, ε 2 represents the strain for NiO suffered at the interface, and d 2 represents the crystal distance of NiO, respectively. After calculating, the theoretical lattice strain for Ni and NiO suffered is 2.7 and 2.6%, respectively. Generally speaking, the elastic limit of most crystal alloys is less than 1.2% [23]. Even for metallic glasses, which have the highest reported elastic limit for bulk metallic materials, they have only 2% of elastic limit [23]. Meanwhile, it is also reported that the elastic limit of Al alloys, Ti alloys and steels, is usually less than 2% [24]. What’s more, it is well known that NiO, which is a kind of ceramic materials, has significantly higher elasticity modulus than metallic Ni. So it can be speculated that metallic Ni, rather than NiO, will unavoidably suffer from plastic deformation under so high lattice strain at the interface. Consequently, a large number of defects, including twins as main defects along with minor presence of lattice distortion, surface steps, SFs etc. will generate. Meanwhile, cool shock, which could cause huge temperature difference between external and inside of grains and has far from enough time for inner stress release and grains growth, is helpful to remain the strain state of Ni-5-R under high temperature, as well as introduce surface steps and keep ultrafine structure of Ni. While, for Ni-5-N with normal heating and cooling rate (3 °C min−1 heating rate and cooling with tubular furnace), almost all reactions begin to occur at temperatures far below 800 °C, which means that there is enough time for grains to grow and release inner stress. Consequently, the grains of Ni-5-N can naturally grow to rather big size. In addition, TBs in Ni-5-N are relatively less and mainly found in bigger grains. The corresponding formation mechanism can be interpreted just as other references reported [25]. Briefly, initial Ni nanoparticles tend to move together and aggregate into bigger particles to decrease high surface energy of boundaries and release inner stress during calcination. Among them, some grains with similar lattice structure will share the same crystal planes driven by elimination of strain, which directly contributes to the formation of high-fold twins (even cross-link twins, penta-twins etc.) [25]. Meanwhile, the choice of reducing agent (here, with MFs as the reducing agent) is also a key factor closely related to the structure and composition of Ni-X-R and Ni-X-N. In comparison, the pure NiⅡ x NiIII 1-x (OH) a (NO3) b (CO3) c ·nH2O precursors without MFs template were calcinated at 800 °C in atmosphere of Ar/H2 (95: 5) for 5.0 min with normal heating and cooling rate. As shown in Fig. S16 (Supporting Information), Ni has undergone significant grain growth and aggregation. The corresponding average grain size is about 3.5 µm, even bigger than that of Ni-240-N, let alone Ni-5-R. That is due to the fact that the reducibility of H2 is too strong and the corresponding crystal growth dynamics is too fast. In stark contrast, the samples reduced by carbon in MFs have obviously smaller grain size due to the more gentle reducibility of carbon. To confirm the accurate content of Ni and C in Ni-5-R, TG test was performed up to 900 °C in air atmosphere as shown in Fig. S17 (Supporting Information). Obviously, the residue after TG test is composed of NiO, which has a mass content of 69.28%. After calculation, the atomic ratio of Ni: C in Ni-5-R is 19.65: 80.35 and the corresponding mass ratio is 54.44: 45.56, as given in Table S4 (Supporting Information). Then, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further performed out to study the difference of surface atomic composition and bonding state between Ni-5-R and Ni-5-N. The full-range XPS spectra of both Ni-5-R and Ni-5-N in Fig. 5d show the presence of C as the main components along with the minor presence of O and Ni peaks (the total surface atom contents summarized in Table S5, Supporting Information), which is significantly different from the results of TG. Since the detecting depth of XPS is just about 2 nm, which mainly reflects the surface composition of wrapped carbon rather than that of Ni nanoparticles. Moreover, the content of O also increases with the carbon content increasing. Meanwhile, the high-revolution XPS was carried out to detailedly investigate the chemical state of single element. As shown in Fig. 5e, it can be seen that Ni 2p spectra of both Ni-5-R and Ni-5-N can be best fitted with two pairs of spin–orbit doublets and two shake-up satellites using a Gaussian fitting method. The most obvious fitting peaks at binding energy of 852.9 and 870.2 eV are ascribed to Ni0 [26,27]. Meanwhile, the other two shake-up satellites located at 859.0 and 875.2 eV belong to multi-electron excitation [28]. In addition, a small amount of Ni3+ and Ni2+ located at 856.4, 873.9 and 854.4, 872.4 still can be detected out due to the slight oxidation of Ni during preparation. As can be seen, both Ni-5-R and Ni-5-N have metallic Ni as the main component, just consistent with the results of XRD and wide-scan XPS. According to the high resolution C 1 s spectrum in Fig. 5f, the peaks of both Ni-5-R and Ni-5-N located at 284.8, 285.1, 286.3 and 288.1 eV are attributed to sp2C, sp3C, CO and CO bonds, respectively [29,30]. According to the chemical bonds content in Table S6 (Supporting Information), both of Ni-5-R and Ni-5-N have obviously higher content of sp2C, which directly reflects the quantity of CC/CC bond related with the ordered and graphitized C. The other minor presence of carbon peaks can be assigned to the defects and oxygen-containing functional groups in carbon. Notably, the major presence of ordered C structure can improve the efficiency of electron transfer and the minor presence of defects and functional groups can promote the hydrophilicity of electrocatalysts to electrolyte. Lastly, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and desorption pore curves were further carried out to investigate the specific surface area and pore properties of Ni-5-N and Ni-5-R, as shown in Fig. S18 and Table S7 (Supporting Information). Obviously, both of these isotherms can be described as type IV isotherms with an obvious hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.45–1.00, typical for mesoporous inorganics with good pore connectivity. It has been widely proved that pore property is closely related to the grain size. As expected, Ni-5-R (175.30 m2 g−1) even exhibits triple higher BET surface area than Ni-5-N (57.12 m2 g−1), as well as double higher desorption cumulative volume of pores (0.1730 m3 g−1) than that of Ni-5-N (0.0843 m3 g−1), indicating that the heat and cool shock technology is indeed beneficial to significantly optimize pore property, consistent with the trend of grain size. The superior surface properties could help to expose active sites and increase contact area between electrolyte and electrocatalysts during HER process, which lays an excellent structure foundation for the following electrochemical tests."
4,Electrochemical characterization,"3.2 Electrochemical characterization The HER electrochemical performance of Ni-5-N and Ni-5-R was systematically investigated and compared to that of commercial Pt/C (the Pt mass loading is 20 wt%) and CC (Carbon Cloth, the substrate for loading electrocatalyst) with the same preparation method. It can be seen from Fig. 6 a-b that CC almost has no HER electrocatalytic activity and commercial Pt/C has the highest activity, just as other references reported [31-34]. Obviously, Ni-5-R possesses high electrocatalytic activity for HER with an overpotential of 68 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Table S8, Supporting Information), significantly lower than that of Ni-5-N, which has an overpotential of 127 mV at the same current density. Meanwhile, Ni-5-R has remarkably lower onset potential with just about −0.0305 V. The slope of Tafel curve is another key kinetic parameter, which directly reflects the changes of potential when current increases 10 times. It is closely related to the rate determining step of HER, including the adsorption of H2O molecule, the electrochemical reduction of adsorbed H2O into adsorbed OH– and H atom, the desorption of OH– to refresh the surface and the formation of H adsorbed intermediate for H2 generation [2,35,36]. It can be calculated according to Equation (4). (4) η = a + b l o g j here η represents the overpotential (mV), a and b represent the constant and j represents the corresponding current density (mA cm−2). Obviously, η and logj should have linear relationship and b is the Tafel slope. After fitting the linear range of Tafel curves (Fig. 6c), there is no doubt that the commercial Pt/C has the lowest Tafel slope while CC has the highest one. Meanwhile, the slope of Ni-5-R is only 104.6 mV dec-1, obviously lower than that of Ni-5-N (Table S8, Supporting Information), suggesting its more favorable reaction kinetics for HER. According to the mechanism of HER in alkaline media, all processes during HER can be concluded in two principal steps: Volmer-Heyrovsky or Volmer-Tafel pathways [37,38], as shown in Equations (5)-(8). (5) H2O + e- → ads + OH– (Volmer) (6) Hads + Hads → H2 (Tafel) (7) H2O + e- → Hads + OH– (Volmer) (8) H2O + e- + Hads → H2 + OH– (Heyrovsky) It is reported that the theoretical Tafel slopes of Equations (5), (6) and (8) are 2.3RT/αF, 2.3RT/(1 + α)F, 2.3RT/2F, which have values of 120, 30 and 40 mV dec-1, respectively [39-41]. According to the detailed mechanism of HER in Fig. 7 , the Volmer process and H2O adsorption can be significantly accelerate by the extensive existence of surface defects. In addition, it has been reported that Ni(OH)2 is easily formed through self-construction on the surface of metallic Ni especially in alkaline circumstance [42,43]. Fortunately, this component is of high significance due to the fact that the high-value Ni can be preferentially attached by the OH– generated by H2O splitting, which will avoid blocking of the nearby Ni active sites, directly promoting Heyrovsky process [44]. Moreover, the process of water dissociation (Volmer process) can be also promoted by Ni(OH)2 [45]. Meanwhile, this process can be also accelerated by the strain of defect-rich Ni since this strain can weaken the interaction between catalysts and adsorbates, accelerate the desorption of adsorbate and refresh the active surface of electrocatalysts [5]. Consequently, the Tafel slope of Ni-5-R in the present work has declined lower than 120 mV dec-1 and the activity has been also improved. Although the activity of Ni-5-R is lower than that of commercial Pt/C electrode, it still can be comparable with other reported HER electrocatalysts (Fig. 6d and Table S9, Supporting Information), including the recently revealed Ni-based electrocatalysts (Ni/CeO2/CNTs [46], NiO/Ni-CNT [44], NiP2 [47], NiS2 [48], NiMo [49], Ni0.89Co0.11Se2 [50]), and other transition metal-based electrocatalysts (Co/Co3O4 [51], MoP/CC [52], WCx [53]), as well as some noble metal-based electrocatalysts (Ni(OH)2/Pt [44], Co(OH)2/Pt(111) [54], Pd, Ru-MoS2-xOHy [55]). This work has an obviously lower overpotential, suggesting that Ni-5-R is indeed a promising candidate as an efficient HER electrocatalyst in alkaline solution. What’s more, the main active component of this electrocatalysts (metallic Ni nanoparticles) only has about 19.7% of atoms content. Meanwhile, the same electrode preparation process and electrochemical tests were performed out to further compare the electrocatalytic activity between Ni-X-R and Ni-X-N, as shown in Fig. S19 (Supporting Information). Clearly, Ni-X-R has obviously lower overpotential and smaller Tafel slope than Ni-X-N, indicating the significantly higher HER electrocatalytic activity of Ni-X-R. Moreover, Ni-5-R has the lowest overpotential and the smallest Tafel slope among all samples. In addition, for all samples except Ni-1-R and Ni-1-N, the crystal size has a roughly positive relationship with the overpotential of 10 mA cm−2 as shown in Fig. S20 (Supporting Information). The difference of overpotential with same grain size between Ni-X-R and Ni-X-N is mainly caused by the significantly different quantity of defects, especially TBs. As can be seen, the heat and cool shock calcination combined with proper insulation time is undoubtedly beneficial to improve the HER activity of Ni. Then CV curves at different scan rate were tested to investigate the influence of heating and cooling mode of calcination to the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Ni-5-N and Ni-5-R (Fig. 6e and Fig. S21, Supporting Information). The detailed value of ECSA can be calculated according to the following Equations (9) and (10): (9) C DL = Q U = i c × t U = i c v (10) ECSA = C DL C 0 here C DL is the double-layer capacitance at the liquid/solid interface; Q is the quantity of electric charge at the interface; i c is the non-Faradaic capacitive current; υis the scan rate of CVs; U is the potential range of CVs; C 0 is the capacitance of ideal oxides, which has a value of 60 μF·cm−2 [56,57]. Obviously, the tested current is positively related to the potential scan rate and the slope corresponds to the value of ECSA. After testing CV curves for a plurality of samples and fitting these plots, the mean values of C DL for Ni-5-N and Ni-5-R are 10.1 and 21.7 mF, respectively. After referring the surface capacitance of ideal and smooth oxides, the corresponding ECSA of Ni-5-N and Ni-5-R are calculated to be 168.6 and 362.0 cm2, respectively. Undoubtedly, Ni-5-R has a significantly bigger ECSA than Ni-5-N, which is caused by the smaller grains and more defects of Ni-5-R than Ni-5-N, further confirming the unique superiority of this heat and cool shock technology. What’s more, the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was performed out to investigate the charge transfer kinetics of Ni-5-N and Ni-5-R at a potential of −100 mV (vs. RHE). As shown in Fig. 6f, both curves only have a semicircle in the whole frequency region and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) can be directly calculated from the diameter of semicircle. Obviously, Ni-5-R shows 5 times lower of Rct than Ni-5-N, indicating its far faster electron transfer kinetics (Table S10, Supporting Information). It is due to the fact that the smaller grain size of Ni in Ni-5-R can provide abundant conductive sites for electron exchange (it can be also proved by the high ECSA of Ni-5-R (Fig. S21, Supporting Information)) and the superior carbon network of Ni-5-R can promote efficiency of electron transfer. Besides, Ni-5-R has 14 times higher capacitance value (CPE-T) than Ni-5-N, further revealing much more electrochemical active sites existed in Ni-5-R. Last but not least, the long-term stability is another key parameter to evaluate HER performance. However, the choice of substrates for loading electrocatalysts is primary factor directly related to stability, especially during violent bubbles evolution, which is always neglected. In this work, chronoamperometry tests were performed out to record the current changes of Ni-5-R loaded on CC and carbon paper (CP) at a high potential of −0.5 V (vs. RHE). As illustrated in Fig. 8 a-b and Fig. S22 (Supporting Information), Ni-5-R loaded on CP shows obviously more superior long-term stability and only degradation ratio of about 18.90% (with current density declining from −176.12 mA cm−2 to −142.82 mA cm−2) is observed after applying a so high potential for about 20.0 h. In contrast, Ni-5-R loaded on CC suffers from significant performance degradation of about 42.08%, especially initial 4.0 h stability test with keeping only about 69.84% of current (the current density has declined from −167.76 mA cm−2 to −117.16 mA cm−2). Theoretically speaking, both of the conductivity and the electrocatalytical performance for CC are superior to that for CP, which are in agreement with the experimental results shown in Figs. S23-S24 and Table S11 (Supporting Information). Meanwhile, after loading with electrocatalysts, Ni-5-R/CC also shows smaller Rct than Ni-5-R/CP (Fig. 8c and Table S12, Supporting Information), indicating its more superior charge transfer property. After continuous H2 evolution under this high potential for 20.0 h, the changes of Rct value for Ni-5-R/CP (Fig. 8c and Table S12, Supporting Information) almost can be ignored (just with increase of 2.0%), significant lower than that of Ni-5-R/CC, which even has changes of 849.8%. Meanwhile, the double electric layer capacitance of Ni-5-R/CP has just decreased from 30.5 mF to 25.6 mF after stability test and the corresponding ECSA has declined from 508.3 cm2 to 426.2 cm2 (Fig. S25 and Table S13, Supporting Information), which also exhibits the high stability of Ni-5-R/CP and the advantage of CP substrates. The significant higher stability of Ni-5-R/CP is mainly caused by the difference of mechanical property between CC and CP. It is well known that CC has rather flexibility and CP is rigid without any flexibility. As shown in Fig. 8f, during long-term HER process, the flexible CC will continuously and automatically vibrate with a high frequency under the impact of violent bubbles evolution, which may directly lead to the peeling of electrocatalysts from CC, especially under high current density. As a result, Ni-5-R/CC electrode has been destroyed before showing its inherent stability. In contrast, the rigid CP, which has significantly higher elastic modulus than CC, can always keep originally stable state during all HER process (Fig. 8e), directly avoiding the effect of peeling off. As expected, Ni-5-R well show its inherent stability. This vibration model can be proved by the first order differential curves of current in Fig. 8d and Fig. S26 (Supporting Information). As can be seen, the differential value of Ni-5-R/CP almost has no changes during all test process. While, Ni-5-R/CC exhibits significantly more obvious fluctuation of differential than that of Ni-5-R/CP, especially during initial 0.5 h stability test. Besides above electrochemical characterizations, a series of physical characterizations were also carried out to investigate the structure and composition evolution of electrocatalytic materials after long-term stability tests at an applied potential of 0.5 V (vs. RHE) for 20.0 h. As shown in the TEM image of Fig. S27a (Supporting Information), Ni-5-R still keeps the defective structure with largely existing stack faults. Meanwhile, Ni nanoparticles still keep the uniform distribution with slightly increased average grain size of about 14.4 nm (Figs. S27b-d, Supporting Information), which may be caused by the self-construction of catalysts in electrolyte. In addition, it can be clearly seen that Ni nanocrystals are still wrapped by few-layer graphene and fixed on the surface of carbon sheets, further confirming the important role of carbon materials in stable HER processes. Meanwhile, XPS characterization was also carried out. Unfortunately, the mass loading of Ni in electrode is too low, leading to rather low peak intensity of Ni. What’s worse, the addition of Nafion into catalysts slurry can form a layer of film on the surface of Ni nanoparticles and thus blocks the photoelectronic signal of Ni nanoparticles, as well as introduces a large amount of F. According to the BE Lookup Table for signals from elements and common chemical species (Table S14), the auger spectra of F are so close to Ni 2p, making it difficult to distinguish them. In order to overcome above limits of signal weakness and signal disturbance, Mg-Al double targets were applied with continuous 100 times scans. As shown in Fig. S28a (Supplementary information), after stability test for 20.0 h, the main elements composition of Ni-5-R has no change. According to the high-resolution Ni 2p spectra of Fig. S28b (Supplementary information), the chemical bond species of Ni also have no changes. However, it can be obviously observed that the peaks of Ni0 decrease while those of Ni3+ and Ni2+ increase after continuous HER. In consideration that XPS is a surface sensitive technology, it can be clearly concluded that the surface high-value Ni is transformed from low-value Ni, further confirming the rationality of self-construction process for Ni nanoparticles in electrolyte. Combining with the analysis of Tafel kinetics, the partial high-value Ni on the surface actually helps to improve activity, which could make up for the degradation of HER performance caused by detachment of electrocatalysts during continuous HER process. In addition, the rational design of electrode structure with fluent diffusion channel and uniformly distributed Ni is another key advantage for Ni-5-R/CP to keep high stability. It is well known that the generated H2 can easily adsorb on the surface of electrocatalysts and even prevent the access for electrons of electrocatalysts to electrolyte because of excess accumulated H2 during long-term HER. What’s worse, large shear stress produced by strong H2 bubble evolution will bring severe influence to the interface between electrolyte and electrocatalysts especially at higher current density. The worst consequence is that electrocatalysts are directly peeled off from the substrate especially for electrocatalysts composed of nanoparticles. In the present work, Ni-5-R has been successfully synthesized with microtubular carbon as robust structure support, which can provide enough pores and short path channels for H2 to fluently diffuse. Meanwhile, the Ni nanoparticles are wrapped by few-layer graphene and fixed on the surface of carbon sheets. Undoubtedly, this conductive carbon network can effectively improve the conductivity and avoid these active nanoparticles coming off under the turbulent flow of bubbles. Finally, the active sites can always be in a state of exposing during long-term stability test. Owing to all of these superior composition and structure, the bubbles evolution of Ni-5-R/CP electrode is still rather violent even applying a so high potential for 20.0 h, as shown in Video S1."
5,Conclusion,"In summary, a new kind of electrocatalysts with microtubular structure composed of Ni nanoparticles and ultrathin carbon sheets has been innovatively synthesized with MFs as templates, carbon resource and reducing agent. Meanwhile, a large number of defects (TBs, SFs, surface steps, lattice distortion et al.) has been successfully introduced in Ni particles by heat and cool shock technology. The synergistic effects of strain induced by TBs, exposed Ni atoms with high surface energy, the wrapping of few-layer graphene, the supporting of conductive carbon network, abundant diffusion channels of microtubular structure and CP as substrates enable Ni-5-R to have high activity and excellent stability for HER. This research could not only provide a new kind of electrocatalysts with innovative structure and composition, which possesses great prospect in applications of hydrogen energy, but also find a heat and cool shock technology for growing ultrafine nanoparticles and introducing defects."
