0,Introduction,"Pyrolysis gasoline is very valuable as byproduct obtained from steam cracking of ethylene together with alkadienes and alkynes impurities, which is unstable and poisonous to downstream catalysts for further polymerization in industry [1,2]. Selective hydrogenation of the highly unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkadienes and alkynes) to olefin is an effective solution in steam cracking to avoid the poison and deactivation of those catalysts [3–5]. Pd-based catalyst is the most preferable choice for such catalytic reaction [5–7]. However, Pd catalysts usually exhibit limited selectivity and poor long-term stability, despite their high activity can be achieved [6,8]. To date, more and more attention has been paid to improve the efficiency of supported Pd-based catalyst to achieve a high yield of target product. The classical strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) was mostly reported in the encapsulation of the metal by an overlayer of the reduced oxide support, which is uncommon in the electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) since the active sites are still exposed to adsorbates [9]. EMSI is mainly featured with the charge transfer between metal and the support [10], which provides a direct way to modulate the performance of catalysts. As one of these catalysts, MgO- and TiO2-supported Au nanoparticles have been extensively studied. For instance, the enriched electrons on Au have promotive effect on the activity for CO oxidation. While combining Pt-TiO2 with MgO enhances reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4, as MgO sites promote adsorption of reactant by interacting with basic site, and the electronic structure of active metal phases can subsequently favour the formation of CH4 [11]. To improve the hydrogenation selectivity of supported Pd catalysts, one strategy is to modify the electronic and geometric structure of Pd catalysts [12,13]. Peng et al. found that the electronic interaction between Pd and MgO-ZnO support results in an electron rich surface of Pd NPs, which would enhance the activity and stability of catalyst [14]. Therefore, a small portion of MgO distributed on the support surface, which displays a great potential for the enhancement of catalytic performance over supported Pd catalysts. However, there is a lack of detailed elucidation of the interfacial structure and EMSI between Pd metal and non-reduced oxide. It is, therefore, nontrivial to experimentally explore the potential of utilizing EMSI to improve catalysis for challenging reactions, we believe it is of paramount importance to rationally design and controllably synthesize metal/oxide interface nanostructures and probe the roles played by EMSI in catalysis. In this work, we aim to create high performance catalytic metal/oxide interfaces with EMSI by growing MgO flakes on MgAl2O4, and shed light on the EMSI effect of Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst in catalyzing isoprene hydrogenation. The characterization results clearly evidenced the existence of negatively charged Pd nanoparticles because of electron donation from MgAl2O4@MgO support to Pd metal. The 3D flower-like hierarchical structure can hinder the atomic metal species migration and the grown MgO flakes modulate the electronic structure of Pd simultaneously owing to the EMSI, therefore, enhancing the hydrogenation activity and stability."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Materials Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, aluminium isopropoxide, hydrochloricacid, palladium chloride and ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company (China). Commercial Al2O3, MgO and MgAl2O4 were supplied by Fushun Research Institute of Petroleum and Petrochemical (China). All of the above chemicals were used as purchased without any further purification. 2.1.2 Preparation of supports In a typical synthesis, 10.21 g aluminium isopropoxide and 6.41 g magnesium nitrate hexahydrate were mixed in 150 ml ethanol to form suspension under vigorous stirring. After stirring for 2 h, the mixed solution was transferred into Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 150 °C for 12 h. After that, the ethanol was evaporated and the resulting product was dried at 90 °C overnight. Finally, the obtained sample was calcined under air at 800 °C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 5 °C/min. The product was labelled as MgAl2O4@MgO. 2.1.3 Synthesis of supported Pd catalysts All catalysts were prepared via the co-impregnation method. Stoichiometric palladium chloride was added to deionized water and the final pH value was adjusted to be around 2 with hydrochloric acid. After that, the MgAl2O4@MgO was added into the solution and then dried at 100 °C for 12 h. Finally, the impregnated sample was calcinated at 350 °C and would proceed to Pd oxycholoride species during calcination in air [15,16], the as-obtained catalyst with Pd loading of 0.2 wt% was denoted as Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO. For comparison, commercial MgAl2O4, Al2O3 and MgO were calcined in muffle furnace at 800 °C for 4 h and used as supports to prepare 0.2 wt% Pd catalysts by using the same impregnation method. The resultant catalysts were denoted as Pd/MgAl2O4, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/MgO, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was measured on a Japan Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer (Cu Ka radiation, λ = 0.15406 nm) operating at 35 kV and 15 mA. The surface area measurements were conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP 3020 nitrogen adsorption instrument (USA) using N2 adsorption isotherms and BET analysis method. Prior to adsorption, the sample was degassed under vacuum at 200 °C for 2 h. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of the Pd catalysts was conducted using a Perkin-Elmer ICP Mass Spectrometer. SEM images were obtained on a Zeiss Sigma SEM microscope. The size and the morphology of the Pd particles were studied and recorded by TEM performed on a FEI Tecnai 30 electron microscope, which equipped with a high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) detector. CO2 and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were measured on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. 100 mg of sample was loaded in a quartz tubular microreactor with He gas flow at 300 °C for 1 h, then cooled down to 50 °C and adsorbed of CO2 or NH3 for 1 h. The desorbed products were monitored by an on-line mass spectrometer with the temperature increased from 50 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was measured on a quartz reactor for each test. Before experiment, the samples (200 mg) were oxidized at 300 °C with 20% O2 for 1 h. After cooled to −10 °C, the catalysts were heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min with H2–Ar mixture (5 vol% H2). H2 consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In situ infrared spectra of CO adsorption (CO-IR) were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus infrared spectrometer. The catalysts were pressed into thin wafers and placed in a reaction chamber with two CaF2 windows. Prior to adsorption, the catalyst was pretreated at 120 °C with H2, then CO was introduced for 5 min after vacuuming at 30 °C, and the CO adsorption spectra were recorded after degassing under vacuum. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations were measured on a Kratos Axis Supra instrument using Mg Kα radiation. The catalysts were treated in H2 stream at 120 °C for 2 h and collected under nitrogen flow before test. The spectra were calibrated using C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as internal standard. Pd dispersions were acquired by CO pulse chemisorption at 40 °C. Before the chemisorption, the catalysts were reduced in H2 stream at 120 °C for 2 h and cooled down to 40 °C in He."
4,Catalytic reactions,"2.3 Catalytic reactions The selective hydrogenation of isoprene was carried out at 1.0 MPa in a fixed bed flow stainless steel reactor, using 10 wt% isoprene in n-heptane as a model reactant. For each reaction, the catalysts (0.10 g) were pre-reduced with high-purity H2 at 120 °C for 2 h, and then cooled down to reaction temperature of 60 °C. Subsequently, liquid and gas feed were adjusted to achieve a H2/n-heptane volumetric ratio of 200, and a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 20 h−1. After a steady state had been reached, the effluent including isoprene, 3-methyl-1-butene (3M1B), isopentane (ISO), 2-methyl-1-butene (2M1B) and 2-methyl-2-butene (2M2B) were collected and detected by a gas chromatographer (GC-9560) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The concentration of the reaction products was calculated from response area of the GC-FID peaks and calibrated against n-decane as an internal standard. All the collected products were evaluated three times, and the accuracy of the concentration was estimated as below 3%. Isoprene conversion (X) and isopentenes selectively (S) were calculated as following: (1) X = ∑ i = 1 5 x i - x 4 ∑ i = 1 5 x i × 100 % (2) S = x 1 + x 3 + x 5 ∑ i = 1 5 x i - x 4 × 100 % where x i represents the molar concentration of the products, i = 1,2,3,4,5 denotes the 3-methyl-1-butene (3M1B), isopentane (ISO), 2-methyl-1-butene (2M1B), isoprene and 2-methyl-2-butene (2M2B), respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared MgAl2O4@MgO, MgAl2O4, Al2O3 and MgO supports were observed in SEM images, as shown in Fig. 1 . The Al2O3 and MgAl2O4 showed a blocky structure with clean surface, while the MgO was composed of microspheres with a few interparticle macropores. In contrast to other supports, the as-prepared MgAl2O4@MgO presented significant difference in morphology. MgO flakes grew out of the original MgAl precursor as the Mg ions exsolved to form MgO phase on the surface during calcination. Such a calcination and exsolution process led to the formation of hierarchical MgAl2O4@MgO materials. SEM images showed that the hierarchical MgAl2O4@MgO was composed of MgO flakes with a roughly geometric size of 200 nm that tend to be vertically oriented and randomly distributed on the entire surface area. This structure feature of MgAl2O4@MgO was favorable for a higher specific surface area (170 m2.g−1) relative to that of MgAl2O4 (66 m2.g−1) and MgO (22 m2.g−1), as listed in Table S1. Accordingly, N2 adsorption isotherms in Fig. S1 showed the characteristics of mesoporous structures, which were in good agreement with the SEM images. Moreover, the synthesized Pd catalysts had almost identical surface area and pore size as compared to the unloaded supports (Table 1 ). Before and after the loading of Pd, there was no significant change in nitrogen adsorption and pore size distribution, as shown in Figs. S1 and S2. These results indicated that we effectively exsolved MgO flakes through calcination procedure on the surface of MgAl2O4. The special structure of MgAl2O4@MgO could facilitate mass-transfer during selective hydrogenation of isoprene and improve the dispersion of supported metal particles during high-temperature treatment. The as-prepared composite oxide supported Pd catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method followed by calcination and reduction. EDS spectra of the Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO sample showed the presence of O, Mg, Al and Pd with a Mg/Al atomic ratio about 1:2 and Pd loading of 0.4 wt% (Fig. S3). The actual content of Pd in the catalysts determined by ICP-MS ranged from 0.182 wt% to 0.199 wt%, which was close to theoretical content (0.20 wt%), as shown in Table 1. HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 2 displayed the distribution of Pd particles over the supported Pd catalysts. Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/MgAl2O4 catalysts both showed a Pd particle size ranging from 1.0 to 14.0 nm with a mean diameter of ca. 5.7 and 5.5 nm, respectively, while larger Pd particles (~13.7 nm) were observed on the Pd/MgO catalyst. Fig. 2(e, f) clearly showed Pd nanoparticles with diameters of 1.0–5.0 nm, even some Pd clusters less than 1.0 nm in diameter, distributed on the surface of MgAl2O4@MgO, resulting in a mean size of 3.7 nm. These observations were highly in line with the dispersions determined by CO chemisorption (Table 1). The surface of MgAl2O4@MgO gave well-dispersed Pd particles with a dispersion of 56.2%, which was about three times that of Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/MgAl2O4, while the Pd/MgO had the lowest Pd dispersion. The difference of Pd dispersion in the reduced catalysts clearly indicated a smaller Pd particle on MgAl2O4@MgO as compared to that on other supports. Because of the unique flake-like architectures of magnesium oxide on the surface of Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst, the support could effectively prevent the aggregation of active metal during high-temperature treatment and generate EMSI effect, which was conducive to the improvement of Pd dispersion and the active sites for hydrogen activation. Therefore, Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst exhibited superior activity and stability in selective hydrogenation of isoprene. To further investigate the structural properties, XRD patterns of the supported Pd catalysts were shown in Fig. 3 a. Intriguingly, the as-prepared Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst presented varying amounts of MgO (JCPDS 45-0946) and MgAl2O4 phases (JCPDS 21-1152) simultaneously. The flake-like MgO randomly distributed on the entire surface area of MgAl2O4, which was confirmed by the SEM and XPS. Except for the corresponding Al2O3, MgAl2O4 and MgO phase over Pd/Al2O3, Pd/MgAl2O4 and Pd/MgO, respectively, no other species were observed in all samples. While diffraction peaks for Pd were not detectable in all catalysts due to the relatively low Pd loading (0.2 wt%). In order to gain insights into the interactions between Pd and supports, H2-TPR experiments were carried out. Before measurements, the catalysts were oxidized at 300 °C with 20% O2 for 1 h. Two well-defined hydrogen consumption peaks could be observed in Fig. 3b. The first peak at low temperature corresponded to the reduction of PdO phases, while the other peak at high temperature was associated with the reduction of small PdO particles finely dispersed on the support [17,18]. In the case of Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO, the reduction peak shifted toward a higher temperature, indicating the forming of highly dispersed Pd species that interacted with support. Meanwhile, H2 consumption on Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO was much higher than other catalysts due to more palladium oxide on the surface of support. It had been reported that supported Pd catalyst with high Pd dispersion and more active sites was in favor of isoprene adsorption, thus resulting in a high isoprene conversion [19]. Next, in situ DRIFT spectra was employed to explore the surface chemical properties of Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO, Pd/MgAl2O4, Pd/MgO and Pd/Al2O3 by using CO as probing molecule. As shown in Fig. 3c, supported Pd catalysts show four different adsorptions of CO on different sites, which could be attributed to linear sites, compressed-bridge sites, isolated-bridge sites, and threefold-hollow sites from high to low wavenumber [20–23]. As for Pd/MgO, the bands at 1950–1900, and 1900–1800 cm−1 could be assigned to isolated-bridge-bonded CO and threefold-hollow-bonded CO on Pd ensemble sites, respectively, while Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/MgAl2O4 presented similar CO adsorption peaks. In contrast to these three catalysts, the intensity of the peaks at 2100–2000 cm−1 and 2000–1900 cm−1 increased evidently over Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst, assigned to CO linear adsorption and bridge adsorption on the atop sites of zerovalent metallic Pd atoms. The increased intensity and the red-shifted peak position of CO adsorption indicated that Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst had negatively charged Pd surface atoms, which could shift the stretching frequencies to the red side [20,24]. Moreover, the peaks of the threefold-hollow sites-bonded CO at 1900–1800 cm−1 were visible on Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst. The additional CO adsorption could only arise from the interaction between Pd nanoparticles and MgAl2O4@MgO whereas Pd/MgO, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/MgAl2O4 had less CO adsorption at 1900–1800 cm−1 under the experimental conditions. These observations were consistent with HAADF-STEM and TPR results. Additionally, apart from the effect of the electronic properties of supported metal on the shifts in CO stretching frequency, it also had been reported to be caused by the changes in crystallite size [9]. Such EMSI effect between small Pd nanoparticles and support on Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst is potentially ideal for the hydrogenation reaction. To investigate the acidity and basicity of different supports [25], NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) experiments were carried out over the as-prepared supports. As shown in Fig. 4 a, Al2O3 showed peaks in ranges of 100–300 °C and 300–500 °C, which were assigned to weak and strong acidic sites, respectively [26]. Both MgAl2O4 and MgAl2O4@MgO presented NH3 desorption peaks in range of 100–300 °C from weak acidic sites, and the MgAl2O4@MgO provided highest intensity, while no peak could be distinguished on MgO. CO2-TPD profiles in Fig. 4b showed two main peaks, the higher desorption temperature around 400 °C could be interpreted as the higher strength of basic centers. The peak intensity of MgAl2O4@MgO was much stronger than those of MgAl2O4 and Al2O3, suggesting that the hierarchical structure composing of flake-like MgO on the MgAl2O4 surface exposed more basic sites. The enhancement of basicity was a key reason for high stability due to the inhibition of oligomer during reaction. It was well known that MgO was a basic oxide, the most basicity was observed especially in Lewis basic sites [14]. The electronic properties of Pd could be influenced by the basicity of the oxide support. The EMSI effect of the Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst could be related to higher level of weak acidic sites and the enhanced basicity. XPS was performed to investigate the chemical nature of the catalyst surface. The samples were reduced in H2 stream and collected under nitrogen flow before the test. The wide-scan XPS survey spectra of the reduced Pd catalysts indicated the existence of Pd, Mg, Al, C, and O (Fig. S4). Pd 3d XPS spectra in Fig. 5 a showed two main peaks at around 335.2 and 340.4 eV, which could be ascribed to Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 of Pd0, respectively [20,27]. The intensity of Pd0 over Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO was much higher than the other catalysts, which revealed that the number of exposed surface atoms was much larger for Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO owing to the nature of the support, while the surface Pd atoms were relatively less for Pd/MgO, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/MgAl2O4. More importantly, it was worth noting that the peaks shifted to lower BE with the elevation of magnesium. The result indicated that the electronic density of Pd increased since magnesium oxide was a good electron donor [14], leading to a weak adsorption strength between isopentenes and Pd particles. Such a change in electronic structure over Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst could be responsible for the selectivity to isopentenes. The flake-like hierarchical structure of MgAl2O4@MgO could hinder the migration of Pd species and modulate the electronic structure of active Pd phases simultaneously. Additionally, Al 2p and Mg 2p XPS spectra for the reduced catalysts were shown in Fig. 5b and c, detailed parameters were summarized in Table 1. The peaks corresponding to Al3+ and Mg2+ were located at 74.3 ± 0.1 eV and 49.8 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. It was found that Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst exhibited larger Mg/Al ratio than other catalysts, mainly due to the flake-like MgO that cover the entire surface of MgAl2O4."
7,Catalytic activity and stability,"3.2 Catalytic activity and stability Selective hydrogenation of isoprene over the supported Pd catalysts were carried out at a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 20 h−1 and a low temperature of 60 °C. The conversion of isoprene and selectivity toward semi-hydrogenation products over different catalysts were shown in Fig. 6 . Semi-hydrogenation products including 2-methyl-1-butene (2M1B), 3-methyl-l-butene (3M1B) and 2-methyl-2-butene (2M2B) were detected along with isopentane (ISO) in this reaction. 2M2B as a main product was formed by the 1,4-addition reaction of isoprene, which was similar to the previous studies [19,28,29]. As shown in Fig. 6, the Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO showed the highest activity over those supported Pd catalysts, and the total selectivity of isopentenes could reach 99.5% with an isoprene conversion of 96.2%. When the reaction was conducted over Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/MgAl2O4 at 60 °C, the alkene selectivity decreased with more saturated alkanes generated. The Pd/Al2O3, Pd/MgAl2O4 and Pd/MgO exhibited an isoprene conversion of 53.0%, 76.1%, 24.7% and a total isopentenes selectivity of 92.1%, 95.9%, 99.5%, respectively. While the isopentenes selectivity improved with the increase of surface MgO. It was also demonstrated that Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst with a lower Pd loading (0.2 wt%) showed a much better performance under lower reaction temperature (60 °C) and higher LHSV (20 h−1) than the typical reported catalysts (Table S2). To better understand the difference of catalytic activity, the reaction rate (k) was evaluated and TOF was determined as the number of converted isoprene molecules per hour and per surface active Pd atom. As shown in Fig. 6b, Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst showed a hydrogenation rate of isoprene as high as 0.39 mol·g−1·h−1. For those supported Pd catalysts, the reaction rate sequence was in the following decreasing order: Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO > Pd/MgAl2O4 > Pd/Al2O3 > Pd/MgO. Interestingly, the introduction of magnesium increased TOF as compared to Pd/Al2O3, while Pd/MgO afford an extremely high TOF due to the low Pd dispersion. These results reflected that the adjustment of electronic state by Pd-MgAl2O4@MgO interaction enhanced the reactivity of Pd catalysts. Tsang group [6] reported that a strong electronic interaction between Pd and the supports dramatically attenuated the absorptivity of Pd surface to achieve ultra-selectivity in partial hydrogenation of alkyne. In this case, a similar electronic effect could be attributed to more efficient activity of Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO. Combining CO-IR and XPS results, the generated EMSI on Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst with flake-like hierarchical structure resulted in enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. The addition of magnesium increased the electron density of metallic Pd, which promoted the dissociation of H2 and weakened the adsorption energy of semi-hydrogenation products thus improved the selectivity of isopentene [30]. Therefore, Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic performance due to the unique hierarchical structure. On the basis of the above discussion and some previous reports [28,31], the reaction process could be well explained by the mechanistic scheme via radical intermediates over Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst composed of MgO flakes (Scheme 1 ). Initially, H2 activation and dissociation occurred at the electron-rich Pd metal sites to form adsorbed H atoms [32], which reacted with isoprene molecule exclusively at a terminal carbon atom and formed corresponding π-allylic radicals. This terminal regioselectivity was ascribed to hydrogen diffusion in the reaction environment [33]. Subsequently, the addition of second H atom occurred at either end of this species, which formed the three isomeric isopentene (3M1B, 2M1B and 2M2B). For achieving high conversion of isoprene but preventing over-hydrogenation, the catalytic performance of Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst was further evaluated at different temperatures, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) and hydrogen/oil ratio. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the conversion of isoprene continued to increase from 83.4% to 97.1% within the temperature range of 40–70 °C, while negligible ISO was detected when the reaction was carried out below 70 °C. At an elevated temperature of 70 °C, the total selectivity toward isopentenes decreased slightly. Maximum yield of isopentenes was obtained at the temperature of 60 °C. The isoprene conversion and product selectivity as a function of LHSV at 60 °C were shown in Fig. 7b. The conversion of isoprene decreased slightly with increasing space velocity, whereas the selectivity toward isopentenes always remained stable. With regard to the influence of hydrogen/oil ratio, it was important to know that a minimum amount of hydrogen was necessary for hydrogenation reaction, however, greater hydrogen excess promoted over-hydrogenation with isopentane becoming major product. Fig. 7c exhibited no significant change both in isoprene conversion and total isopentenes selectivity with the hydrogen/oil ratio ranged from 100 to 300, which indicated the high activity and selectivity of Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst. To further investigate the catalytic stability of the Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst, the selective hydrogenation of isoprene was evaluated for 80 h under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the isoprene conversion (~95%) and selectivity toward isopentenes (~98%) remained almost constant during long-term test, indicating the excellent stability of the catalyst. SEM image of the Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst reacted for 80 h in Fig. 8b also indicated that the unique flake-like architecture of MgO on the MgAl2O4 surface was very stable and similar to that of fresh catalyst (Fig. 1b). MgO aggregation on the catalyst surface was not observed for the whole test of isoprene conversion. The used Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst was also examined by HAADF-STEM, as shown in Fig. 8, most of the Pd particle size ranged from 0.5 to 5.0 nm with a mean size of 3.6 nm, suggesting that there was no obvious aggregation of Pd particles during reaction. One reason could be that the isoprene hydrogenation conducted at relatively low temperature led to very limited sinter of Pd."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, hierarchical MgAl2O4@MgO support with unique flake-like architecture of MgO on the MgAl2O4 surface had been synthesized successfully. As compared with those of Pd/Al2O3, Pd/MgAl2O4, and Pd/MgO, the as-prepared Pd/MgAl2O4@MgO catalyst showed more excellent catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation of isoprene, including higher conversion (96.2%) and selectivity (99.5%) of semi-hydrogenation products at 60 °C under an LHSV of 20 h−1, which maintained over 80 h during a long-term test. The improved catalytic activity and stability originated from the electronic and geometric interaction between Pd and MgAl2O4@MgO, which was known as the EMSI effect. In fact, high specific surface MgAl2O4@MgO exceptionally helped to disperse and stabilize Pd particles, while the MgO flakes on the surface increased the electron density of active Pd, resulting in weak adsorption energy of semi-hydrogenation products. These promising results may also guide the rational design of other potential catalysts with enhanced activity and stability for selective hydrogenation."
