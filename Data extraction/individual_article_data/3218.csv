0,Introduction,"The conversion of synthesis gas (syngas, CO+H2) into valuable products is currently considered a major scientific target [1,2]. Higher alcohols (C2+OH) synthesis (HAS) stands out as a catalytic route of significant interests because of its potential application as fuel blends or value-added chemicals in fine chemical synthesis [3,4]. Currently, Cu-contained catalysts for higher alcohols synthesis from syngas are mainly alkalis-modified methanol synthesis catalysts [3–6] and Cu-modified Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis catalysts [7,8]. Alkalis can neutralize the acid on the catalysts surface and are considered to be indispensable for higher alcohols synthesis from syngas on alkalis-modified methanol synthesis catalysts [9]. For Cu-modified F-T synthesis catalysts, F-T (Fe, Co and Ni) elements function as CO dissociation and carbon-chain growth, the synergistic effect of Cu and F-T elements plays a key role in determining the catalytic performance [8,10]. The liquid products will mainly compose of methanol if alkalis and F-T elements are absent in Cu-based catalysts. As well known, the catalytic conversion of syngas to methanol over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts is an established, large-scale industrial process with the yield of methanol over 99% [11,12]. Nonetheless, in our previous study, it is found that the syngas could be catalyzed to ethanol and higher alcohols over CuZnAl catalyst by a complete liquid-phase method [13]. However, the catalyst is unstable and the higher alcohols selectivity gradually decreased to 5% after 120 h reaction [14]. Recently, phosphorus has attracted wide attention as a catalyst promoter due to its abundant valence electrons which can modify the electronic environment of metal, resulting in high catalytic property and stability [15–17]. Aboulayt et al. [18] found that the introduction of phosphorus would generate stronger acid site which was a key factor to make the catalyst very active. Therefore, in this study, a series of P-modified non-noble metal Cu-based catalysts were synthesized using a complete liquid-phase method, aiming at improving the catalytic stability for the synthesis of C2+OH from CO hydrogenation. As comparison, Cu-based catalysts without the addition of P was also prepared and tested. The effect of phosphorus on the performance of non-noble metal Cu-based catalysts was characterized comprehensively by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Solid-state 27Al NMR spectroscopy (27Al-MAS-NMR), N2 adsorption-desorption, H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalysts with Cu:Zn:Al:P molar ratios of 2:1:0.8:0.05, 2:1:0.8:0.1 and 2:1:0.8:0.2 (denoted as P0.05, P0.1 and P0.2), were prepared by a complete liquid-phase method developed by our group [19]. The method consisted of two steps: precursor preparation and liquid phase heat treatment process. First, aluminum isopropoxide [(C3H7O)3Al] was added into an aqueous solution of citric acid and (NH4)2HPO4 to hydrolyze at 50°C for 3h, then the hydrolytic temperature was raised to 95°C and kept for 0.5h. Next, solutions of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in glycol were added dropwise to the above mixture. At last, the resulting solution was stirred at 95°C until a homogeneous sol was obtained. After aging for 10days, the sol was dispersed in liquid paraffin, heated under N2 atmosphere from room temperature to 300°C at a ramping rate of 5°C/min and maintained at 300°C for 8h, thus, the slurry catalyst was subsequently obtained. The catalyst without phosphorus was also prepared as reference and named as P0."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Before characterization, the slurry catalysts were centrifuged, extracted by petroleum ether to remove the liquid paraffin and dried at room temperature to obtain the solid samples. XRD measurements were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15418nm), operating at 40kV and 100mA. 27Al-MAS-NMR measurements were recorded on a Bruker Avance DSX 500 spectrometer with a 27Al frequency of 130.4MHz. The textural properties of samples were carried out by N2 adsorption at −196°C on a Micromeritics Quanta chrome instrument. H2-TPR tests were performed on TP-5000, using 5% H2/N2 gaseous mixture, and the hydrogen consumption was recorded using a thermal conductivity detection (TCD) device. NH3-TPD experiments were measured using the same apparatus as TPR. The samples were saturated with pure NH3 for 30min and then flushed with a He flow. A AMETEK mass spectrometer was used to monitor the desorbed NH3. XPS was carried out using an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer equipped with Al Kα radiation (hυ=1486.6eV, 150W)."
4,Catalytic activity test,"2.3 Catalytic activity test CO hydrogenation to C2+OH reaction was performed in a 0.5L continuous slurry reactor with continuous mechanical agitator. The catalytic evaluation was carried out in the reactor by introducing the syngas (H2/CO=2, V/V) under 4.5MPa, 250°C with a feed flow rate of 150mL/min. All activity data were collected after at least 24h from beginning of reaction. The outlet gas H2, CO, CH4, CO2 and C1–C5 hydrocarbons were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph with a TCD detector (TDX-01 column) and FID detector (PLOT/Q column), respectively. The liquid products were collected daily and analyzed offline using the same device."
5,Results and discussion,
6,XRD characterization,"3.1 XRD characterization Fig. 1 showed the diffraction patterns of the fresh catalysts. It could be seen that P0 and P0.1catalysts showed weak peak at 2θ=36.3° assigning to ZnO. The strong peaks at 2θ of 43.3°, 50.4° and 74.1° were corresponded to the (111), (200) and (220) reflections of Cu0 crystalline phase (JCPDS card No. 04-0836), respectively. No CuO and Cu2O were found. This was probably due to the partly decomposition of liquid paraffin, which resultantly produced the free carbon, and then subsequently caused the reduction of CuO [20]. In addition, no P crystal phases were detected, indicating that P species in these samples existed in an amorphous state or were below the detection limit of XRD."
7,Nuclear magnetic resonance,"3.2 Nuclear magnetic resonance Since the diffraction peaks of the Al species also could not be detected using XRD. Thus, the phases of the Al species of the fresh catalysts were confirmed using 27Al-MAS-NMR. It could be seen from Fig. 2 that the resonances were at approximately +8ppm, which was attributed to octahedral AlO6 sites of AlOOH [21,22]."
8,Textural properties,"3.3 Textural properties The N2-physisorption isotherms of fresh catalysts with different P content were shown in Fig. 3 . According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification, the isotherms were type IV. Type H1 hysteresis loops were observed in all catalysts. This type of hysteresis loop could be assigned to the mesoporous material with cylindrical particles and a uniform size. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model was used to estimate the mesopore size distributions of the catalysts. The P0 and P0.05 catalysts had two kinds of mesopores, whereas P0.1 and P0.2 catalysts possessed only one kind of mesopore and the pore size distribution tended to become wider with the increase of P content. More detailed textural analysis was shown in Table 1 . It could be seen that the BET surface area increased, whereas pore volume and average pore diameters decreased after reaction for all catalysts. This might probably due to that the catalyst was prepared by complete liquid-phase method, which caused a small amount of liquid paraffin adsorbed in the pores of catalyst, the adsorbed liquid paraffin was then gradually removed out during the reaction. However, we could not find any correlation between the physical properties of catalysts and their catalytic activities."
9,XPS investigations,"3.4 XPS investigations The chemical state and surface components of catalysts with different P content were characterized by XPS. Fig. 4 showed the Cu2p XPS spectra of fresh catalysts. The Cu 2p3/2 XPS peaks were around at 931.5–932.0eV (BE) with no shake-up satellite peaks in the range of 940–945eV existed, indicating that copper species were present as Cu0 or (and) Cu+ [23,24]. The Zn2p3/2 BE of the four catalysts was located at about 1021.5eV, suggesting Zn species were present as ZnO [20]. The Al 2p BE value was about 74.2–74.5eV, corresponding to Al-OH bonds, which was in agreement with Al in AlOOH [25]. These results were consistent with the XRD and 27Al-MAS-NMR analysis. The P2p BE was located at about 133.6eV, due to P5+ species [26]. In addition, it could be observed that the BE of Cu2p3/2 increased, whereas the BE of Al 2p decreased after the addition of P (seen in Table 2 ), suggesting that the addition of P changed the chemical surroundings of Cu and Al species. Moreover, as observed in Table 2, the surface Cu/Al ratio increased with the increase of P content, suggesting that the introduction of phosphorus would increase surface Cu content, which might promote the hydrogenation in C2+OH synthesis."
10,The reducibility of catalysts,"3.5 The reducibility of catalysts To investigate the reduction behavior of the catalysts, TPR measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. 5 , all catalysts showed two reduction peaks in the range temperature, suggesting two kinds of Cu species existed on the catalysts surface. The first peak was due to the reduction of dispersed Cu+ according to XPS analysis, whereas the higher temperature was attributed to the reduction of Cu+ species which had strong interactions with zinc or aluminum oxide [14]. It could be found that the first peak area of the P-promoted catalyst was smaller than that of P0 catalyst, suggesting that the introduction of P could reduce a part of Cu+ to Cu0, while excess P could cause more reducible Cu+ which had strong interaction with support. In addition, compared with the TPR profiles of P0 catalyst, the first peak of these P-promoted catalysts shifted to lower temperature, indicating that dispersed Cu+ could be reduced more easily to Cu0 after P added, which suggested that the incorporation of P could improve the copper reducibility. It was reported that ethanol synthesis from syngas over Cu/SiO2 catalysts required synergistic effects of Cu+-Cu0 sites, in which Cu+ mainly acted as the stabilizer of the methoxy and acyl species [27,28]. Combined with the following activity performance results, these P-promoted catalysts exhibited relatively stability toward CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols, which suggested that improving the copper reducibility might beneficial to improve the catalysts stability."
11,The surface acidity of catalysts,"3.6 The surface acidity of catalysts NH3-TPD experiments were conducted to analyze the surface acid property which was considered to influence the efficiency of CO hydrogenolysis [29,30]. As seen in Fig. 6 , The NH3-TPD profiles showed a single peak of NH3 desorption at about 400K for all catalysts and this weak acid site could be attributed to weak interactions that occurred between the OH groups of the oxides and NH3 [31,32]. Herman et al. [33,34] reported that OH and Cs+ could activate CO to form formyl and formaldehyde intermediates, which inserted into lower alcohols to form corresponding higher alcohols. Lu et al. [35] studied the effect of OH groups on the SiO2 in C2+ oxygenates synthesis from syngas, results showed that hydroxyl-metal interaction was the crucial factor to obtain higher CO conversion and C2+ oxygenates selectivity. In this study, based on the amount of weak acid in consistent with C2+OH selectivity well, while AlOOH had abundant OH groups on the catalysts surface and was considered as the main reason for surface weak acid formation. Thus, we supposed that AlOOH played a key role in higher alcohols synthesis."
12,Catalytic performance,"3.7 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance of P-promoted catalysts was studied and compared with that of P-free catalyst. The average data for 120h were presented in Fig. 7 . One can see that the CO conversion gradually reduced from 19.8% for P0 to 11.7% for P0.2 with the P content increasing from 0 to 0.2. However, the C2+OH selectivity increased from 36.0% to 52.9%, and further decreased to 43.5% with increasing phosphorus content, which suggested that there existed an optimal P content in C2+OH synthesis and an excess of P would promote the formation of methanol. In addition, as shown in Fig. 8 , the yield of each alcohol and hydrocarbon overall decreased with the increase of carbon number except for alcohol distributions of P0 catalyst, which was similar to conventional CuFe and CuCo based catalysts, indicating that they had the same reaction mechanism in C2+OH synthesis. Therefore, we speculated that these non-noble metal Cu-based catalysts possessed active site, similar with F-T elements, which functioned as CO dissociation and carbon-chain growth. An example of such distributions was displayed in Fig. 9 for the P0.05 catalyst, it was observed that the carbon number distributions of alcohols and hydrocarbons were in good agreement with the ASF rule and the chain growth probability α could be calculated as 0.331 and 0.522, respectively. The α value was even bigger than some of Cu-modified F-T catalysts [36–38]. Till now, to our best knowledge, no relevant researches achieved such high selectivity of C2+OH over non-noble metal Cu-based catalyst without alkalis and F-T elements. Fig. 10 presented the stability of different catalysts with time on stream. It could be observed that incorporation of an appropriate amount of phosphorus into the non-noble metal Cu-based catalyst not only increased the C2+OH selectivity significantly, but also dramatically improve its stability towards C2+OH formation. The CO conversion of P-free catalyst P0 first increased and then gradually decreased as time on stream, the C2+OH selectivity also first increased and then sharply decreased to 17% after 120h. However, compared with P0 catalyst, these P-modified catalysts showed relatively long-term stability toward both CO conversion and C2+OH selectivity during the lifetime test of 120h."
13,Discussion,"In the process of higher alcohols synthesis from syngas, a bifunctional (dual site) center of catalysts was necessary for all types of catalysts. CO was firstly dissociated on the one site and hydrogenated to produce alkyl species (CHx). Then the non-dissociated CO was adsorbed on the other site and inserted into CHx to form acyl species (CHxCO∗), and further hydrogenation to produce higher alcohols, the synergism between the two sites was benefitted to the formation of higher alcohols [39,40]. In this study, based on the above characterization analysis, Cu species was reduced to Cu0 and Cu+, Zn species and Al species were presented as ZnO and AlOOH, respectively. As we discussed above, the distribution of alcohol and hydrocarbon over this kind of catalysts was similar to conventional CuFe and CuCo based catalysts. Thus, there might have active site, similar with F-T elements, which functioned as CO dissociation and carbon-chain growth. Meanwhile, AlOOH had abundant OH group which was believed the crucial factor to form hydroxyl-metal interaction and produce higher alcohols [35,41]. Thus, we speculated that AlOOH favored CO dissociation in higher alcohols synthesis. In addition, it was reported that surface Cu0 sites acted dissociative adsorption of H2 and promoted the hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis reactions, while Cu+ sites could function as stabilization of the intermediates in ethanol synthesis from DMO [12,28,42]. Thus, it was conclude that Cu0, Cu+ and AlOOH were all necessary and the synergism of these species was beneficial to the formation of higher alcohols. The incorporation of suitable amount of P into the catalysts could increase the amount of weak acid and improve the Cu+ reducibility, which promoted the synergistic effect between Cu and Al, resulting in better catalytic performance."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, we have demonstrated that alkalis and F-T elements were not indispensable for direct synthesis of C2+OH from syngas over non-noble metal Cu-based catalyst. The production of alcohols and hydrocarbons over this kind of catalyst followed A-S-F distributions, similar with conventional CuFe and CuCo based catalysts. The incorporation of suitable amount of P into the catalysts could increase the amount of weak acid and improve the Cu+ reducibility, which promoted the synergistic effect between Cu and Al, and thus enhanced the catalysts stability as well as the higher alcohols selectivity. It was speculated that AlOOH favored CO dissociation, and the synergism of Cu0, Cu+ and AlOOH was beneficial to the formation of higher alcohols. This work introduced a new insight into the C2+OH synthesis over non-noble metal Cu-based catalyst."
