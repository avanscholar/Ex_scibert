0,Introduction,"Aqueous alcohol solutions are extensively used in many different applications from everyday life to science. To name but a few, it is worth mentioning their role in the efficient exfoliation of inorganic graphene analogues [1], in the synthesis of polydopamine nano-spheres [2]), as disinfectant [3], or in solar energy devices [4]. Obviously, they are at the core of the bioethanol industry [5,6]. Additionally, research on alcohol solutions has a potential impact on biological investigations. The amphiphilic character of alcohols turns them into the simplest laboratory model to analyze the behavior of more complex biological macromolecules: hydrogen bonding, hydrophobicity and non-polar interactions are all at play in alcohol solutions, and these effects are a key to understand the behavior of biomolecules in water. From a more fundamental point of view, the thermodynamic behavior of these systems exhibits a series of anomalies, closely connected with those of water [7,8], in particular at low alcohol concentrations. Thus, small amounts of alcohol in solution induce large increases in the heat capacity, or contrary to the effect of most solutes, the temperature of maximum density of water is slightly augmented for alcohol mole fractions of the order 10−3. This can qualitatively be interpreted as a result of these solutes making water even more anomalous. Already back in the forties, Franks and Evans [9] suggested that these anomalies could be explained in terms of the so-called “iceberg model”. According to this model, the alkyl tails of alcohols (and other hydrophobic solutes) tend to enhance the tetrahedral structure of surrounding water molecules [10]. From the experimental point of view, the full microscopic picture of water/alcohol mixtures is still far from being completely understood [11]. From all the thermodynamic anomalies of alcohol aqueous solutions it is worth stressing the very singular effect of short-chain alcohols on the temperature of maximum density (TMD) of water. Wada and Umeda [12] have shown that the addition of small amounts of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and tert-butanol (TBA) raises the TMD, in contrast with the effect of other organic solutes [13] and electrolytes [14]. This increase of the TMD is only visible in a small concentration range (typically for alcohol mole fraction x less than 0.01). For higher concentrations the TMD decreases as in regular solvents, until the density anomaly disappears. As a consequence, the change in the TMD of the mixture with respect to pure water exhibits a maximum at low alcohol mole fractions, a feature that is unique to short-chain alcohols. Qualitatively, one can interpret this effect in terms of the balance between the high density and low density (tetrahedral) structures present in liquid water. The low density structure reminiscent of ice dominates right after melting. As temperature increases, H-bonds break and a more compact high density structure occurs giving rise to the presence of a maximum (TMD). Small amounts of alcohol are fully soluble (with the hydroxil group taking part in water's H-bond network), but the alkyl groups reorganize surrounding water molecules (iceberg effect) enhancing the tetrahedral structure in the same way as other hydrophobic solutes do [10]. This promotion of the low density water structure then increases the TMD. Nonetheless, a quantitative picture of this phenomenon in terms of intermolecular interactions is still lacking [15]. Molecular simulation [16,17] is a powerful technique to establish a correspondence between the macroscopic behavior of a system and its intermolecular interactions. In classical simulations, it is usual to describe the molecules as a set of sites whose interactions are defined through analytic functional forms, such as springs for bonded interactions, or Lennard-Jones and/or Coulombic potentials for nonbonded interactions. The model parameter values are commonly fitted to a set of target macroscopic properties of the substance to be simulated at a given temperature and pressure. Sometimes vapor-liquid equilibrium curves are also used in the fitting procedure and in some other cases ab initio data are used to define the effective potential parameters. In any case, the question of parameter transferability remains open, when conditions away from the fitting range are to be simulated. Pure substance parameterizations can be straightforwardly applied to mixtures by defining the cross interactions between sites of different species using combining rules. In fact, it is also customary to use combining rules to define interactions between sites of different type even when they belong to the same molecular species. The limitations of this approach in the latter instance are in most cases subsumed by the fitting procedure in pure substances. In the case of mixtures, however, the use of combining rules is merely an educated guess, and sometimes it is completely inappropriate. The best option then is to fit the cross interactions parameters to yield a reasonable description of the mixture thermodynamics. Given the large amount of cross interaction parameters to be fitted even in the simplest binary mixtures, this approach has not been widely exploited in the literature. A considerable body of work has addressed the study of aqueous solutions of methanol [18–31], ethanol [18,21,26,30,31–44], 1-propanol [18,21,31,45,46], 2-propanol [18,41,46–51], and tert-butanol [22,23,34,41,52–66] using molecular simulation, in most cases Molecular Dynamics (MD). A variety of molecular models have been employed, in most of the cases resorting to simple combining rules to define cross interactions. These investigations are mainly focused on structural properties (and to a lesser extent on transport and excess thermodynamics properties). Aside from our recent simulation and experimental study on the TMD for the {methanol+water} system [67], to our knowledge, no other work has focused on the anomalous effect of short-chain alcohols at high dilution on the TMD of water using molecular simulation with realistic models. In order to investigate further the effects of the alkyl chain length and shape of short-chain alcohols on the TMD of water, we have performed an extensive simulation study of aqueous solutions of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and tert-butanol. Alcohols were described using flexible OPLS-AA force fields as proposed by Jorgensen [68] and water by the TIP4P/2005f model of González and Abascal [69]. A first goal of our work has been to produce a new reliable parameterization of these systems valid over the whole composition range at ambient conditions. To that aim, and in order to reduce the computational complexity of the problem, all LJ cross parameters were set to values given by the geometric combining rule, except those between the oxygen of water (Ow) and the oxygen of the alcohols (OOH). These were fitted to reproduce the experimental excess enthalpy, h E, and the excess volume, v E, at 298.15 K and 1 bar. Then, we have tested the ability of our mixture model to describe the changes in the TMD of water induced by the addition of small amounts of these short-chain alcohols."
1,Models and simulation details,
2,Models,"2.1 Models Alcohols are modeled using the OPLS-AA force field proposed by Jorgensen [68] and water is described by the TIP4P/2005f proposed by González and Abascal [69]. The potential energy U in a {alcohol+water} binary mixture is the sum of three contributions: alcohol-alcohol U A, water-water U W, and alcohol-water U AW. In what follows explicit details of these three contributions are presented. {Alcohol-Alcohol}. In the OPLS-AA force field, each atom in a molecule is considered as an interaction site. The potential energy, U A , consists of two terms, a bonded, U bonded A , and a non-bonded contribution, U nonbonded A . The bonded contribution comprises energy terms stemming from bond stretching, angle bending and torsional intramolecular potentials, as follows (1) U bonded A = U bond A + U angle A + U torsion A (2) U bond A = 1 2 ∑ a , b k a b ( r a b − r a b 0 ) 2 (3) U angle A = 1 2 ∑ a , b , c k a b c ( θ a b − θ a b c 0 ) 2 (4) U torsion A = ∑ a , b , c , d ( ∑ n = 0 5 C n ( ϕ a b c d − 180 ∘ ) n ) where a, b, c, d, denote atoms in the molecule, k the spring constant, r the distance, θ, the bond angle, ϕ, the dihedral angle, Cn , the Ryckaert-Bellemans constants, and the superindex 0 denotes the corresponding equilibrium values. The functional form of the non-bonding term is (5) U nonbonded A = ∑ a , b f a b [ 4 ε a b [ ( σ a b r a b ) 12 − ( σ a b r a b ) 6 ] + 1 4 π ε 0 q a q b r a b ] , where fab = 1.0 when a and b atoms belong to different molecules, fab = 0.0 when they belong to the same molecule but are separated by less than three bonds, and fab = 0.5 when the site separation is three bonds, and again fab = 1.0 for larger intramolecular separations. The Lennard-Jones parameters are denoted by ε and σ, partial charges by q, and ε0 denotes the vacuum relative permitivity. The Lennard-Jones cross parameters between atoms a and b are computed in the OPLS-AA force field from the atom characteristic atomic values (εa, εb ) and (σa , σ b ) using the geometric combining rule (6) ε ab = ( ε a ε b ) ; σ ab = ( σ a σ b ) The OPLS-AA model parameters for the atoms of the alcohols of this work are given in Tables 1–4 . Alcohol sites will be hereafter denoted by HOH (hydrogen of the hydroxyl group), OOH (oxygen of the hydroxyl group), C (carbon site), and H (hydrogen linked to a carbon site). Note that the partial charge assigned to each carbon site depends on its bonding environment, i.e., it will differ according the number of H, and O directly linked to it. {Water-Water}.The TIP4P/2005f is the flexible version of the well-known TIP4P/2005 model of Abascal and Vega [70]. It is known to reproduce correctly the experimental temperature of maximum density of water, as well as many other structural and thermodynamic properties. Preliminary calculations carried by us have shown that it is more suitable than its rigid counterpart to reproduce the pressure dependence of the TMD. Like the TIP4P model, it consists of four interactions sites, three representing the atoms of the water molecule (OW for the oxygen and HW for the hydrogen), and an auxiliary fourth site (M-site) along the bisector of the bond angle, θ = H w − O w − H w ^ . The OW site consists of a Lennard-Jones center with ε O W / κ B = 93.2 K and σ O W = 0.31644 nm, the HW is a bare point charge with q H W i = 0.5564 e , and finally, the auxiliary M-site is also a bare point charge, q M = − 1.1128 e with a variable separation from the OW site, given by r O W − M = 0.13194 ( z O W − H W 1 + z O W − H W 2 ) with z O W − H W i = r O W − H W i cos ( θ / 2 ) , where r O W − H W i is the bond distance between the OW and HW sites. The bonded contribution to the potential energy U bonded W consists of two terms (7) U bonded W = U bond W + U angle W (8) U bond W = ∑ i = 1 2 D r [ 1 − exp ( − β ( r O W − H W i − r O W − H W i 0 ) 2 ) ] (9) U angle W = 1 2 k θ ( θ − θ 0 ) 2 where Dr = 432.581 kJ·mol−1, r O W − H W i 0 = 0.9419 nm , kθ = 367.810 kJ·mol−1·rad−1, and θ 0 = 107.4°. The non-bonded interaction between water molecules U nonbonded W is given by eq. (5) with the corresponding Lennard-Jones and partial charges of the TIP4P/2005f model. {Alcohol-Water}. The non-bonded interaction between alcohol and water molecules, U nonbonded AW ,follows also Eq. (5) with the Lennard-Jones cross parameters between OW and the corresponding LJ centers of the alkyl group atoms of alcohols calculated using the geometric combining rule – Eq. (6)–. As mentioned, the cross terms between the OW sites and OOH site of alcohols are fitted to reproduce the experimental excess properties, following the procedure described below."
3,Fitting procedure,"2.2 Fitting procedure Both ε O w − O OH and σ O W − O OH , were optimized to obtain the best fit of the experimental excess enthalpy, h E, and the excess volume, v E, at 298.15 K and 1 bar over the whole composition range following the scheme: i) Initial guesses for ε O w − O OH and σ O W − O OH are set using the geometric combining rule – Eq. (6)–, denoted as ε O w − O OH GM and σ O W − O OH GM . A series of molecular simulations from low to high alcohol concentrations were run and both the excess enthalpy and excess volume are evaluated at specific alcohol mole fraction, x, denoted as h E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM , σ O W − O OH GM ) and v E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM , σ O W − O OH GM ) . ii) The same type of molecular simulations were also run changing the parameter values by finite differences as ε O W − O OH GM ± Δ ε and σ O W − O OH GM ± Δ σ in order to evaluate the series of excess properties at each alcohol mole fraction, x, h E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM ± Δ ε , σ O W − O OH GM ) , v E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM ± Δ ε , σ O W − O OH GM ) , h E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM , σ O W − O OH GM ± Δ σ ) , and v E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM , σ O W − O OH GM ± Δ σ ) . iii) These quantities are used to evaluate the derivatives of the h E and v E with respect to ε O W − O OH and σ O W − O OH at mole fraction x by using centered differences, e.g. (10) ( ∂ h E ( x ) ∂ ε O W − O OH ) = h E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM + Δ ε , σ O W − O OH GM ) − h E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM − Δ ε , σ O W − O OH GM ) 2 Δ ε iv) Using a first order Taylor expansion around ε O W − O OH GM and σ O W − O OH GM one obtains a first approximation to the functional dependency of the h E and v E on ε O W − O OH and σ O W − O OH as (11) h E ( x ; ε O W − O OH , σ O W − O OH ) = h E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM , σ O W − O OH GM ) + ( ∂ h E ( x ) ∂ ε O W − O OH ) ( ε O W − O OH − ε O W − O OH GM ) + ( ∂ h E ( x ) ∂ σ O W − O OH ) ( σ O W − O OH − σ O W − O OH GM ) (12) v E ( x ; ε O W − O OH , σ O W − O OH ) = v E ( x ; ε O W − O OH GM , σ O W − O OH GM ) + ( ∂ v E ( x ) ∂ ε O W − O OH ) ( ε O W − O OH − ε O W − O OH GM ) + ( ∂ v E ( x ) ∂ σ O W − O OH ) ( σ O W − O OH − σ O W − O OH GM ) v) A least squares residue is constructed using the expressions above and the experimental values for the set of mole fractions under consideration. Then a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to determine the optimum values of ε O W − O OH and σ O W − O OH that minimize the objective residue function (13) Φ = ∑ x = 0 1 [ h E ( x ; ε O W − O OH , σ O W − O OH ) − h exp E ( x ) ] 2 + ∑ x = 0 1 [ v E ( x ; ε O W − O OH , σ O W − O OH ) − v e x p E ( x ) ] 2 where subindex exp refers to experimental values. vi) Molecular simulations are performed with the values resulting from the fit in step v), ε O W − O OH and σ O W − O OH . If the new simulated excess properties are not satisfactory when compared to the experimental values the procedure returns to step ii) using now the results from the fit as initial estimates, and the scheme is repeated until the desired convergence is attained."
4,Simulation details,"2.3 Simulation details NpT molecular dynamics simulations in a cubic box under periodic boundary conditions were performed with a time step of 1 fs using GROMACS/2018.3 software package [71]. Temperature and pressure were fixed using the Nose-Hoover thermostat [72,73] and the isotropic Parrinello-Rahman barostat [74,75], with relaxation times of 2 ps. Coulombic interaction contributions were evaluated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method [76] using a 0.1 nm mesh and a fourth-order interpolation for the Fourier component of Ewald summations. The real part of the Ewald sums and Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated at 1.0 nm; standard LJ long-range corrections were included. The initial configuration was built using the insert-molecules module of GROMACS/2018.3 with the initial molecular structure of alcohols and water generated with the MOLDEN package [77]. Three series of simulations were performed in order to obtain an equilibrated configuration at each thermodynamic state (T, 1 bar, x): an initial NVT run using as starting point the initial configuration, a second NpT run at 100 bar, and finally an expansion NpT run at 1 bar. The initial configurations in the last two steps were the final configurations of the previous steps. Each of these simulations were 1 ns long. At each thermodynamic state (T, 1 bar, x) one production run 10 ns long was carried out using the equilibrated configuration as starting point. The averaged enthalpy and the volume were computed for subsequent calculations. Statistical uncertainties were estimated using the block average method obtaining averaged values of 0.02 kJ·mol−1 and 0.02 cm3·mol−1. Excess enthalpy h E and volume v E (section 3.1) were computed from the simulated enthalpy h and volume v through the following relations (14) h E = h − x h A − ( 1 − x ) h W (15) v E = v − x v A − ( 1 − x ) v W where A and W denote pure alcohol and water respectively. Excess properties were computed from runs of 500 molecule samples at alcohol mole fractions x= 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, in addition to runs for the pure substances, all at 298.15 K and 1 bar. For the calculation of the TMD (section 3.2) we have used 2000 molecule samples at alcohol mole fractions x= 0.005, 0.015, 0.025, and at temperatures 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, and 330 K, and with the pressure set to 1 bar."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Excess properties: Lenard-Jones cross parameters determination,"3.1 Excess properties: Lenard-Jones cross parameters determination 3.1.1 A worked example: {methanol + water} Excess molar enthalpies h E, and excess molar volumes v E, for the {methanol+water} binary system at atmospheric pressure and 298.15 K were experimentally determined by Lama and Lu [78] and by Benson and Kiyohara [79], respectively. These data are plotted in Figure 1 as full lines. Both excess properties take negative values over the whole composition range; the h E – x curve displays a minimum at low mole fractions, whereas in the v E – x curve the minimum appears close to the equimolar composition. Experimental data are compared in Figure 1 with simulation results obtained using the geometric combining rule for all the LJ cross parameters (results of step i of the fitting procedure). The standard uncertainties in simulated h E and v E were estimated around 0.03 kJ·mol−1 and 0.03 cm3·mol−1, respectively. As it can be seen, v E is well described by simulations, but the simulated h E deviates considerably from the experimental data, with the minimum shifted towards a much higher mole fraction. Clearly, there is room for improvement, so then we move to the fitting procedure. Starting from the geometric mean estimates, the different stages of the first iteration of the optimization procedure are illustrated in Figure 2 . After a couple of iterations the optimal values obtained were ε O W − O OH = 0.96970 kJ·mol−1 σ O W − O OH = 0.31118 nm, which now lead to accurate h E and v E values, as illustrated in Figure 3 . 3.1.2 Other {alcohol+water} systems The same procedure described above for methanol aqueous solutions was used to obtain the fitted LJ cross parameters between water's oxygen OW and that of the hydroxyl group OOH for {ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and tert-butanol + water} binary systems. Experimental excess enthalpies h E were reported by Lama and Lu [78] (ethanol, 2-propanol solutions), by Davis and Ham. [80] (1-propanol), and by Koga [81–83] (tert-butanol). Experimental excess molar volumes v E were measured by Benson and Kiyohara [79] (ethanol and 1-propanol), Davis and Ham [80] (2-propanol), and Kipkemboi and Easteal [84] (tert-butanol). The final values of ε O W − O OH and σ O W − O OH are reported in Table 5 . Figure 4 shows the h E values obtained by simulation using parameters of Table 5 plotted as a function of alcohol mole fraction x for all binary mixtures under consideration, and compared with experimental data. As it can be seen, the shape of the experimental h E-x curves is well described by these simulations, exhibiting a proper location of the minima and maxima at low and high alcohol concentrations, respectively. A good quantitative agreement is found in all cases. Figure 5 collects all the simulated v E data compared with experimental results. In this case, a very good description is also attained for systems containing ethanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol. In contrast, simulation v E results for aqueous solutions of tert-butanol are consistently above the experimental values for x>0.2 . Further iterations of the fitting procedure did not improve the results, which seems to suggest that other cross LJ interactions (e.g. OW-C) might have to be included in the optimization procedure in order to fix this shortcoming. Exploring the possibility of defining a common set of LJ parameters for short-chain alcohols,we found ε O W − O OH = 0.7 kJ · mo l − 1 ; σ O W − O OH = 0.317 n m . These values were determined after observing that similar simulation results are found if the fully optimized LJ parameters are slightly modified by decreasing ε O W − O OH and increasing σ O W − O OH , simultaneously. Simulation results using these LJ parameters were found to lie very close to those obtained from the optimized parameters for all alcohols mixtures with the sole exception of the excess enthalpy of methanol/water (with slightly higher values), as can be seen in the Supplementary Material. For the sake of simplicity and without a great loss of precision, these values can be alternatively used instead of those given in Table 5 for aqueous mixtures of ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol and tertbutanol."
7,Temperature of maximum density,"3.2 Temperature of maximum density Densities ρ obtained by isothermal-isobaric simulations using the model parameters of Table 5 at atmospheric pressure for our binary systems at alcohol mole fractions x= 0.005, 0.015, and 0.025 and for pure water are plotted in Figure 6 as a function of temperature T. Black circles in the upper part of each graph correspond to pure water results (TIP4P/2005f model) which follow very accurately the experimental ρ -T curve (also shown as a black line [85]), as was previously found by González et al. [69]. Addition of small amounts of alcohol reduces the sample density to different degree depending on the type of alcohol, shifting the TMD to values lower than that of pure water. A quantitative estimation of TMD was performed by fitting the ρ -T data to a third degree polynomial ( ρ = A + B · T + C · T 2 + D · T 3 ) and solving d ρ / d T = B + 2 C · T + 3 D · T 2 = 0 . The resulting TMDs are presented in Table 6 . The standard uncertainty of the TMD evaluation was estimated in 1 K. Figure 6 also shows experimental density values [79,80,84] at x = 0.025 and 298.15 K for all the systems. As can be seen, a good agreement was found compared to the simulation results except maybe for the 2-propanol mixture. The change in the TMD of water due to the addition of alcohol, ΔT = TMD (mixture) -TMD (pure water), is plotted in Figure 7 as a function of alcohol mole fraction, x, for all the systems under study. Experimental data from Wada and Umeda [12] are included in the figure for comparison. One immediately appreciates that the simulated ΔT exhibits a monotonic decrease considerably more pronounced than that of the final section of the experimental curves. In all instances, the maxima in ΔT vs x for very dilute solutions present in the experimental results, is missing in our simulations. This is in agreement with the findings of previous works [67,86] where we observed the same behavior for diluted aqueous solutions of methanol [67] and amino acids [86]. Thus, the “structure maker” character experimentally found for these short-chain alcohols is not captured by our models. This means that even potential models able to capture the experimental behavior of molar excess properties over the whole concentration range, fail to account for the subtle effect that these short chain alcohols have on the structure of water. One must however stress, that, despite being subtle, this effect leads to a qualitatively different behavior of the TMD curves. All simulated ΔT data are plotted together in Figure 8 as a function of alcohol mole fraction, x,(left) and mass concentration, c, –mg alcohol/gram of water– (right). The variation of ΔT vs x presents a strong correlation with the alcohol molar mass (methanol, 32.04 g, ethanol, 46.07 g, propanol, 60.09 g, and tert-butanol, 74.12 g); in other words, the higher the molar mass the stronger the change in ΔT with x. This molar mass effect is no longer visible if ΔT is plotted against mass concentration, c (left graph of Fig. 8). As can be seen, all data approximately collapse into the same curve. This actually means that, in the simulated results, the only factor that determines differences in the behavior of different alcohols is the size of the alkyl chain, and actually, the dependence of ΔT on its molar mass is linear. A quantitative assessment of this effect can be attained by fitting the ΔT data to the Despretz equation [87], ΔT = Ky·y, where K y is the Despretz constant, and y can be either the alcohol mole fraction, x, or its mass concentration, c. Results are collected in Table 7 . The Kc values are lying in the interval (-0.015, -0.013) K·mg−1·g, and are rather similar to those previously obtained for aminoacids in water [86] (-0.012, -0.010) K·mg−1·g, which were also determined using the OPLS-AA force field. These results suggest a slightly stronger change of ΔT with concentration for short chain alcohols as compared to aminoacids solutions, which contradicts the experimental results [12,86]. Somehow, in contrast with the experimental behavior, our OPLS-AA models overestimate the “structure breaker” character of short-chain alcohol, and miss completely the “structure maker” effect experimentally found at very high dilutions."
8,Conclusions,"Extensive NpT MD simulations of aqueous solutions of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and tert-butanol at atmospheric pressure and at 298.15 K were performed. Alcohols were modeled using the OPLS-AA force field and water was described by using the flexible version of the TIP4P/2005 model. The Lennard-Jones cross interactions between alcohol and water sites were defined using the geometric combining rule except those between the oxygen sites of water and alcohols which were fitted to reproduce the experimental excess enthalpy, h E, and excess molar volume, v E. Simulation results with the proposed parametrization yield an accurate description of h E and v E for all systems, with only some discrepancies for the v E of aqueous solutions of tert-butanol. Interestingly, for alcohols with alkyl chains longer than that of methanol, ε O W − O OH = 0.7 kJ · mol − 1 ; σ O W − O OH = 0.317 nm lead to very similar simulation results compared to those obtained with the fully optimized parameters. These values should be a better choice than the use of plain mixing rules. The effect of the addition of small amounts of these alcohols on the temperature of maximum density of water was studied using this parametrization and compared with experimental data. Simulations were performed at atmospheric pressure and in the temperature interval (250-330) K. The experimental increase of the TMD at very low alcohol concentrations was not reproduced by the simulation results. Consequently, our model fails to properly capture the experimental “structure maker” character of short-chain alcohols. In all the cases, simulated TMDs decreases strongly with concentration, overestimating the experimental Despretz constants, Kc. These are very similar with values lying in the interval (-0.015, -0.013) K·mg−1·g. Despite the good quality of our models for the excess thermodynamics of mixtures over the whole composition range, they cannot account for the subtle influence of the presence of small amounts of these alcohols solutes on the TMD of water. The inclusion of flexibility in our models does not improve the results when compared with those previously obtained for rigid models [64]. Clearly, one needs to consider most likely non-additive effects such as those of polarizability and/or charge transfer, and produce a more accurate representation of the peculiar nature of hydrogen bonding in order to overcome the shortcomings of the present models."
