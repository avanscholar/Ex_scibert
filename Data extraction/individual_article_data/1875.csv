0,Introduction,"Environmental issues, for instance, air and water pollution, directly affect people's lives, which are driving the demands for renewable energy and environmental purification. As known to all, using the semiconductor photocatalysts to degrade organic pollutants seems to be the most prospective environmental purification techniques, since this can directly absorb sunlight to induce free electrons and holes for generation of hydroxyl radical (·OH) or reactive oxygen species (·O2−) making pollutants become small molecules that are environmentally sound [1–3]. As far as materials and structures are concerned, the design and fabrication of TiO2-based heterostructural photocatalysts still remain one of researching hotspots currently. Up to now, researchers have adopted many measures to improve TiO2-based heterostructures photocatalysis activity, and acquired some substantial progress [4–9]. But it is not enough, we still need to continue exploring highly active, multi-functional, chemically stable and low-cost TiO2-based heterostructural nanophotocatalysts [10–13]. In our previous work, we selected a p-type compound semiconductor NiS with narrow band-gap (1.2 eV) to embellish TiO2 nanoflowers with exposed {001} facets for constructing NiS/TiO2 3D nanoflower-like p-n heterostructures [14]. Different from other works elsewhere reported [15–17], that's structure acquired high photodegradation efficiency for removal of methyl orange (MO) under visible light. With in-depth study, we find that as-prepared NiS/TiO2 p-n heterostructure photocatalyst can accomplish the goals for increasing light absorption in the visible spectral range, enhancing separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and conducting photocatalytic redox reaction with reactive radicals [18,19]. But the excessive potential energy difference between the valence band (VB) edges of TiO2 and NiS will inhibit the holes transfer partially, leading to the problem of imbalance of charge carriers transport. Clearly, this is a worthwhile problem in design and preparation of high efficient photocatalysts, and further inspires us to seek a suitable p-type assistant catalyst for modifying the NiS/TiO2 heterostructure that would enhance the holes transfer for charge carriers transport balance in the oxidation-reduction process. Recently, we noticed that Ni(OH)2, as a p-type compound semiconductor with wide band gap (3.7 eV), was used in very early water decomposition, given its proper straddled conduction and valence band positions relative to the water reduction and oxidation potentials [20]. And Ni(OH)2 also has excellent electrochemical activities for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors [21–23], revealing its good retention capacity and stability. Even more interestingly, Ni(OH)2 can be oxidized by the photoexcited holes (h+) generated in process of degradation and hydrogen production, generating NiOOH [24–26], which is a very active catalyst for the reaction of oxidation of organic pollutants [27]. Many studies have reported that the active phase β-NiOOH can be easier to convert from β-Ni(OH)2 each other through the addition irons [28] or through oxidation-reduction reaction (OER) [29]. That suggests introducing moderate β-Ni(OH)2 into NiS/TiO2 p-n heterostructure may be a viable option to further improve its photocatalytic activity. Herein, aiming at the photo-generated charge carriers transport balance problem, we attempt a new way, using β-Ni(OH)2 as modifier to design and construct a new 3D flower-like p-n-p heterostructural photocatalyst β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 through a facile two-step hydrothermal and chemical bath deposition methods. The results show that the obtained samples have superior photocatalytic activity for removal of anionic dye MO under visible light, much better than that of the NiS/TiO2 p-n heterostructure. And not only that, we find this new nanostructure can produce hydrogen from the pollutant solution synchronously. So in this paper we will discuss the sample's structure design, morphology and structural phase characterization, performance comparison and evaluation, function analysis in detail, and also propose a possible reaction mechanism. This study would offer a new idea for design and construction of new kinds photocatalytic devices that can not only degrade pollutants but also produce hydrogen in them."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers,"2.1 Preparation of β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers Shown in Fig. 1 , in simple terms, 0.2 g 0.001-NiS/TiO2 nanoflowers that were prefabricated by two-step hydrothermal method [14], were added into secondary water (60 mL), and stirred well with 300 rpm for 30 min by using a magnetic stirrer. Then to modify β-Ni(OH)2 of different quantity onto 0.001-NiS/TiO2 nanoflowers, different amount of hydroxide containing nickel acetate (Ni(CH3COO)2 (mole ratio x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (mole ratio 0.02) were in turn added into above pale grey solution, which was stirred with 600 rpm for 1 h. Finally we obtained a series of β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 3D flower-like p-n-p heterostructural nanocomposites, the corresponding samples were respectively marked as x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 (mole ratio x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02). Next, the x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 nanoflowers were washed and dried to remove the absorbed water for subsequent characterizations."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations The surface morphology and nanostructure of the synthesized samples were observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6701F, 5 kV), transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai-G2-F30, 300 kV) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-2400, Cu Kα1, 0.154056 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA) was employed to determine the sample's crystal phases. The chemical composition and chemical states of the material were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5702) using Al-Ka monochromatic radiation. The absorption speciality of the samples were test with an Ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 900 spectrometer). Photoluminescence spectra (PL, PerkinElmer LS-45) were measured by 290 nm line of Xe laser. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was made at the Autolab electrochemical workstation using three-electrode cells in the frequency range of 0.000 Hz–1000 Hz. Keithley 4100 digital source (LDCNW-White (nature), 700 mA, 690 L m) was used to measure the photocurrent response curves."
4,Photocatalytic activity measurement,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity measurement Photocatalytic degradation performances of as-synthesized samples were assessed via photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) solution that has very low self-degradability, with a concentration of 10 mg/L under simulated sunlight at room temperature. The reactor with 30 mg of prepared photocatalysts in 30 mL MO aqueous solution was irradiated under an energy density of 100 mW cm−2 by using 500 W Xe lamp (CHF-XM500, Beijing Trusttech Co, Ltd) as simulated solar light source with a certain time interval. Before degradation, the solution was left in the dark for 30 min to achieve an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and MO solution, at this point it was considered to be the initial concentration (C 0). After then the MO concentration at different irradiation intervals was tested as the concentration (C) of the degradation process. The photocatalytic experiments for hydrogen evolution were performed in a quartz glass reactor (total volume 250 mL) coupled to gas chromatography by using a 300 W Xe lamp. The reaction mixture was cool downed to 20 ± 2 °C by using an extrinsic water cooling system. For a typical reaction, 100 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed with stirring in 100 mL aqueous solution or MO aqueous solution containing 10% (v/v) methanol as a sacrificial reagent."
5,Results and discussion,"Fig. 2 shows the FESEM and TEM photographs of morphologies for the as-prepared TiO2 nanoflowers, 0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n heterostructural nanoflowers, and x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers. Clearly, the apparent morphologies of obtained samples basically keep their flower-like shape from the initial TiO2 nanoflowers formed with {001} facets (see Fig. 2a–b) to the precursor 0.001-NiS/TiO2 (see Fig. 2c), and even to the x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 (see Fig. 2d–f), which are desired structural morphologies that can offer more active sites for photocatalytic reactions. But upon closer inspection, you can see in Fig. 2d–f that the precursor 0.001-NiS/TiO2 nanoflowers are modified and gradually covered over by the stacks of the β-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates with increasing the molar ratio of Ni source from 0.005 to 0.02 in the precursor solution, suggesting there should be an optimal value for the modifier. The TEM images of the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 in Fig. 2g–h and inset also show that about 6–8 nm thick β-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates are indeed decorated on the 0.001-NiS/TiO2 surface. The HRTEM image (see Fig. 2i) further verify that the lattice fringes with interplanar distances of about 0.230, 0.258, and 0.235 nm are consistent with their fringe spacing of the (110) plane of β-Ni(OH)2, (101) plane of NiS, and (001) plane of TiO2, respectively. And the overlap of corresponding SAED pattern (see inset of Fig. 2i) among β-Ni(OH)2, NiS and TiO2 would indicate the β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 heterostructures have successfully formed in the samples. The above results of Fig. 2 are also validated in part by the XRD data as shown in Fig. 3 , such as the {001} facets of TiO2 are dominant in the obtained flower-like samples, including TiO2, 0.001-NiS/TiO2 and x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2. In which the major diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.3°, 36.9°, 37.7°, 38.5°, 48.0°, 53.8°, 55.0°, 62.7°, 68.7°, 70.2°,75.0° and 76.0° can be assigned to the (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), (215) and (301) planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDF card No.84–1285), respectively. And the modifier β-Ni(OH)2 phase can be observed at 2θ = 33° and 59° when its molar ratio is higher than 0.01, which correspond to the reflection from (100) and (110) planes (JCPDS card No.14–0117), respectively [30]. In addition, the diffraction maximum of NiS do not appear in Fig. 3, due to its very low molar ratio in the sample. Next, with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique the sample's surface chemical compositions and chemical states were further investigated as shown in Fig. 4 . Here the full-scale XPS spectrum for the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 heterostructural nanoflowers is presented in Fig. 4a, in which C, Ti, O, S and Ni elements are spotted, and no other impurities were observed. The 6 eV peak separation of the Ti 2p spectrum in Fig. 4c appearing at 458.86 eV (2p3/2) and 464.54 eV (2p1/2) can be put down to the existence of Ti4+ [31,32]. In Fig. 4d, the first peak, about 530.1eV, is assigned to the lattice oxygen (Ti–O) in TiO2. Other high resolution O1s XPS spectrum is deconvoluted into two peaks at 531.8 and 533.1eV. The former is ascribed to hydroxyl oxygen (Ni–OH), whereas the latter is associated with adsorbed molecular water [33–35]. In the S 2p spectrum of Fig. 4e, the peak seated at about 160.98eV is assigned to S 2p3/2 states, which can be attributed to the anionic S2−, confirming that S species in the sample are exist as S2− ions [36]. In Fig. 4f inset, the deconvolution of the spectrum shape in the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 regions reveals the two main stronger peaks at 855.8 (its satellite at 861.6eV) and 873.6eV (its satellite at 879.9eV). Among them, broad satellite peaks appearing in 861.6 and 879.9 eV (FWHM ~5.5 eV–6.5 eV) can be well indexed to the shakeup satellite peaks of Ni2+ ions in Ni(OH)2 [30,37,38], the main peak spin-energy separation is also computed to be 17.7 eV, corresponding to the characteristic of Ni(OH)2 [39–41]. Therefore, combined with XRD data, these results indicate the prevalence of the β-Ni(OH)2 phase. In enlarged image of Fig. 4f, the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin-orbital electrons of Ni in NiS are mainly located at binding energies of 853.6 and 870.6 eV, respectively, which are assigned to a Ni2+ ion [42]. Based on the above XRD and TEM data analysis, it can be confirmed that the β-Ni(OH)2 phase is embedded in the 3D TiO2 nanoflowers modified with a small amount nickel sulfide. For comparative analysis of optical and electrical properties of different samples, Fig. 5 presents the relevant test data. Fig. 5a shows the UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra spectrum of the TiO2 nanoflowers, 0.01-NiS/TiO2 p-n and x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers (x = 0.005, 0.01 and 0.02). It can be seen that in the visible light region of 390–700 nm, the absorption intensity of the x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers have been enhanced obviously, compared with the pure TiO2 nanoflowers. However, the absorption intensity of x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 are slightly decreased with the increases of modifier β-Ni(OH)2 M ratio x, compared with the 0.001-NiS/TiO2. This means that in β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 system the component that dominates visible light absorption is NiS with a narrow band-gap (1.2 eV), rather than β-Ni(OH)2 with a wide band gap (~3.8 eV). Actually, the role of the modifier β-Ni(OH)2 in the β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 system is to help light-induced charge carriers separation and effective transfer, which are supported by the data in Fig. 5b–d. The photoluminescence (PL) quenching spectra in Fig. 5b clearly show the emission peaks from the TiO2 nanoflowers, 0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n and x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers (x = 0.005, 0.01 and 0.02), respectively. It is quite evident that the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers have the lowest PL intensity, that means the lowest radiative recombination rate, imply the molar ratio of 0.01 is an optimal value for the modifier β-Ni(OH)2. The reason of decrease of PL intensity would owe much to the fast charge transfer due to well matched energy band structures of the β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2, as shown in Fig. 9. This inference will be further authorized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) decomposition in Fig. 5c, in which the Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra are for the TiO2, 0.001-NiS/TiO2 and 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 nanoflowers, respectively. Obviously, the charge-transfer impedances determined by radius of the semi-circle at high frequency region change in the order of 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 < 0.001-NiS/TiO2 < TiO2, indicating the photo-generated charge carriers transport across the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 is more excellent. This conclusion is directly supported by the photocurrent responses of the above samples, which were performed under simulated sunlight irradiation with light-on-off cycles, as seen in Fig. 5d. Apparently, the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflower presents larger photocurrent response than that of the pure TiO2 nanoflower and 0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n heterostructural nanoflower, because of its superior photoelectric performances including such as higher light harvesting, minimum radiative recombination rate and charge transfer impedance. In short, above the data of optoelectronic properties test confirm each other and further show that the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers would effectively promote photo-generated charge carriers separation and balance transport, which is more conducive to improve the photocatalytic activity. On the basis of the above discussion, we will contrast and assess the photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared samples by testing degradation degree of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution under simulated sunlight, as shown in Fig. 6 . The testing results in Fig. 6a show that the degradation efficiency of the x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers first increases and then decreases with the increase of the β-Ni(OH)2 M ratio x. And the optimal degradation efficiency is obtained from the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 nanoflowers, as high as 98.3% within 15 min. The result is very exciting, better than expected. In comparison, the testing results also reveal that here only the right amount of β-Ni(OH)2 to modify the precursor 0.001-NiS/TiO2, the x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers can gain a higher photocatalytic activity [43], Otherwise, excessive β-Ni(OH)2 will greatly weaken the light absorption of NiS/TiO2 in Fig. 5a and cause sample agglomeration in Fig. 2f, thereby reducing photocatalytic activity. Simultaneously, too little β-Ni(OH)2 will become the carrier recombination center and increase the annihilation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in Fig. 5b, reducing photocatalytic activity. In order to compare the photodegradation kinetics of the pure TiO2 nanoflowers, 0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n and x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers intuitively and clearly, through a linear transform relationship of ln (C0/C) = Kt, we find that the transformation results follow the pseudo-first-order reaction model. Fig. 6b presents the calculated degradation rate constant (K) of the above samples, where the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers possess the maximum K value of 0.2015 min−1, approximately 2 and 12 times higher than that of the 0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n heterostructural nanoflowers (0.1146 min−1) and the pure TiO2 nanoflowers (0.0163 min−1), respectively. In addition, the effect of pH values on photodegradation kinetics in the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 photocatalytic system was investigated, as shown in Fig. 6c–d. It can be seen that with the increase of pH values (3, 5, 7, and 9), the MO's photodegradation rate shows a trend of first increase then decrease, and gains the maximum of 0.2015 min−1 at pH 7, suggesting that overly acidic or basic conditions are unfavorable for bringing into full play the role of photocatalytic degradation [44,45]. So, it can be said that the prepared 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers has higher photocatalytic activity under neutral pH condition, which is conducive to practical applications and cost savings. In order to find a scientific evidence for the reaction mechanism of MO degradation in the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers photocatalytic system, the experiments for exploring the dominant effects of radical scavengers were implemented to make sure the leading role of the active species. In which the potassium dichromate (PD), ammonium oxalate (AO), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were used as the radical scavengers for the electrons (e−), holes (h+), and hydroxyl radicals (·OH), respectively. As seen in Fig. 7 a, the different radical scavenger plays different role in the MO photodegradation. No radical scavengers, the degradation efficiency of the MO can get as high as 98.3%, and once adding the radical scavengers PD, AO and IPA, respectively, the MO degradation efficiencies decrease in different degrees, and reduce to 24.5, 92.3 and 62.4%, in turn. Based on the experimental results, we can tell that the active species e− and ·OH play dominant roles, while the holes (h+) have a weak effect on the MO degradation in this photocatalytic system. Then Fig. 7b gives the facts of cycle degradation MO experiments in the photocatalytic system under the same conditions. After four recycles, the degradation rate of the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 shows a negligible decrease, implying its good stability during the photocatalytic processes under neutral pH conditions. Finally, a comparative investigation on the hydrogen production performances of the as-prepared samples was made. Fig. 8 shows the time courses of photocatalytic H2 production and rates of H2 evolution in turn in the TiO2 nanoflowers, 0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n and x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers photocatalytic systems with pure water or MO aqueous solution without the need for using noble metal adjunction. It can be seen from Fig. 8a and b that photocatalytic H2-production activity of the x-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers first increases and then decreases with the increase of the β-Ni(OH)2 M ratio x. And the optimal H2 evolved rate reaches 18.782 μmol h−1 is from the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers, more than 2 times of the 0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n heterostructural nanoflowers. This shows that introducing right amount of β-Ni(OH)2 will be greatly improved the photocatalytic H2-production activity. Interestingly enough, Fig. 8c and d shows the same change trend for the same experiment carried out in the pollutant MO aqueous solution, that is the optimal H2 evolved rate reaches 7.282 μmol h−1is from the 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers, well above 4.216 μmol h−1 of the 0.001-NiS/TiO2 p-n heterostructural nanoflowers. The whole decline of H2 evolved rate can be attributed to the consumption of degrading MO. Although the photocatalytic H2-production rate is not high, the new 3D flower-like p-n-p heterostructural photocatalyst β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 is not only ideally suited for removal of anionic dye methyl orange (MO), but also release of hydrogen from the MO solution driven by photoelectric conversion without the need for using noble metals. On the basis of the above experimental consequence and analysis, in order to comprehensively understand the enhancement principle of the β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructural nanoflowers photocatalysts, we present a schematic diagram for qualitative explanation of the possible photocatalysis mechanism. As shown in Fig. 9, the energy band structure of the β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructure are illustrated, which gives out the values of the band gap (Eg) of β-Ni(OH)2, NiS and TiO2 (3.7, 1.2 and 3.2 eV), the positions of their valence band (VB) top edges (1.9, 0.8 and 2.9 eV), along with the location of their conduction band (CB) bottom edges (−1.8, −0.4 and −0.3 eV), respectively. Here the electrons excited onto the CB of NiS by visible light can be spontaneously inject into the CB of TiO2 due to well matched CB energy structure (with 0.1 eV negative offset). And the holes transfer would be inhibited partially from the VB of TiO2 to the VB of NiS due to the excessive potential energy difference (with 2.1 eV positive offset) between their VB edges, bringing to the problem of imbalance of the photoexcited charge carriers transport. Fortunately, it could be settled by using p-type β-Ni(OH)2 to modify NiS/TiO2 heterostructure in order to unblock holes energy transport channel for the charge carriers equilibrium transport, because its VB top edge (1.9 eV) is just in between the VBs of TiO2 (2.9 eV) and NiS (0.8 eV), as seen in the plot of energy band structures. Obviously, the experimental results above-mentioned have proved the effectiveness of the design of the energy band structure, which could not only furnish an internal electric field to promote photogenerated charge carriers efficient separation, but also provide an effective energy channel of equilibrium transport for them. In real space, the electrons (e−) accumulated in the CB of TiO2 will spontaneously transfer to its low-energy {101} crystal planes from the high-energy {001} crystal planes, and a part of these active electrons directly react with absorbed oxygen on the surface to produce ·O2− radicals, and another part of electrons react with H+ to produce H2 [46]. And the equivalent holes (h+) accumulated in the VB of TiO2 will smoothly transfer to the β-Ni(OH)2 surface, and a part of holes directly react with approached H2O molecules to produce ·OH radicals, and another part of holes plus OH− can directly oxidize β-Ni(OH)2 (holes collector) to generate β-NiOOH radicals that also can be reduced to β-Ni(OH)2 and keep working in the dynamic process of redox [30,47]. Thus, the series of active groups such as ·O2−, ·OH, NiOOH will play important roles in the process of degrading MO dye solution and releasing hydrogen, and the principal reaction processes involved in this system can be depicted by Eqs. (1)-(6) as below."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, aiming at the photo-generated charge carriers transport balance problem, a new 3D flower-like p-n-p heterostructural photocatalyst β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 is designed and prepared by a facile two-step hydrothermal and chemical bath deposition methods. The special nanostructure is ideally suited for both removal of anionic dye methyl orange (MO), and release of hydrogen from the MO solution driven by photoelectric conversion without the need for using noble metals. And the removal efficiency for the optimal molar ratio of 0.01-β-Ni(OH)2/0.001-NiS/TiO2 can reach as high as 98% within 15 min and its production of hydrogen is about 7.2 μmolh−1 from the MO solution in visible light radiation. The outstanding performances should be ascribed to the synergistic enhancement effect of the β-Ni(OH)2/NiS/TiO2 p-n-p heterostructure on two aspects. One is the effect of high efficiency charge separation and transfer driven by an internal electric field at the interfaces between NiS/TiO2 and exposed high energy {001} facets of TiO2. The other is the influence of the modifier β-Ni(OH)2 as an assistant sacrificial agent can play an important role of the holes transfer for charge transport balance in the oxidation-reduction process, and the generated active species NiOOH also has a beneficial effect on degrading MO and releasing hydrogen. From research on this p-n-p heterostructural photocatalysts, we will be inspired by new ideas for design and construction of new kinds of photocatalytic devices that can not only degrade pollutants but also produce hydrogen from the pollutant solution synchronously."
