0,Introduction,"To globally reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and gradually resolve the derived environmental issues, the catalytic conversion of renewable lignocellulosic resources to bio-fuels and chemicals has received worldwide attention [1–5]. In recent years, pentosan-derived furfural (FF), a versatile platform compound, has been intensively studied [6]. Because the catalytic activation of different functional groups in FF would produce various high-valued fine chemicals with wide applications in polymer, energy, pharmaceutical and flavor industries [7,8]. As shown in Scheme 1 , hydrogenation is the dominant upgrading route for FF but would create a complicated network of products due to the addition reactions on different unsaturated bonds, yet furfuryl alcohol (FA) is no doubt the most valuable product and is also a hub to obtain the downstream products [9–11]. Currently, about 65% of the global FF is consumed to produce FA that represents a sustainable precursor for manufacture of resins, lubricants and fibers. Therefore, the precise control of product distribution is critical for valorization of FF, and to achieve this objective relies largely on developing highly selective catalysts and technologies. The selective reduction of CO bond of FF in water medium using molecular H2 as hydrogen donor remains challenging in fundamental research due to the lack of an effective adsorption and dissociation of H2 on a metal surface, even though this process is environmental-benign and cost-effective. For industrial manufacture of FA, Cu as inexpensive catalyst has been used. However, Cu–Cr industrial catalyst causes severe environmental issues and also requires rather high hydrogen pressure (≥7 MPa) and reaction temperature (≥200 °C) [12]. Up to date only a few traditional hydrogenation catalysts including supported Ir [13], Pd [14], Pt [15] and Ru [16] noble-metal nanoparticles have been reported for conversion of FF to FA in water (Table 1 ). On the other hand, supported-Co as non-precious metal catalyst was recently described to be able to cleavage H2 and to hydrogenate FF to FA [17,18]. Nonetheless, most of them still afford insufficient yield to FA and must work with pressurized H2 and long time, which results consequently in potential safety hazard and formation of over-hydrogenated by-products. Thus a heterogeneous catalyst to work under ambient H2 pressure with rapid respond is highly desired. Recently, the structure-dependent product selectivity over cobalt oxides in FF hydrogenation was studied [19]. Interestingly, it was disclosed that Co3O4 and Co phases promoted preferential hydrogenation of CO group of FF to FA whereas CoO phase induced a further hydrogenolysis of FA by selective production of 2-MF. This inspires us that the structural evolution of Co catalyst by various pre-treatments may play a crucial role in tuning products distribution. Cobalt and cobalt oxides are renowned as an important class of magnetic catalysts [20]. The magnetic materials usually present high mechanical and thermal stability. And moreover, the unique magnetism and inherent insolubility of Co-based nanoparticles are highly preferable for liquid-phase organic reactions, because minimal energy and chemicals are needed to effectively recover the solid catalyst by an external magnetic field compared to the traditional filtration or centrifugation [21]. However, only a few magnetically recoverable catalysts merely due to Co magnets have been reported so far, mainly including Co/C nanocatalyst for alkylation of various carboxylic acids [22], Co@CoO core–shell nanocrystals for photocatalytic water splitting [23], and Co3B nanoparticles for oxygen evolution [24]. In this work, we intended to design a magnetic Co-based catalyst to selectively convert FF to FA at ambient H2 pressure using molecular H2 as hydrogen donor. In order to enhance the activity of Co catalyst we introduced the less expensive Ru noble metal to construct a bimetallic RuCo active site. We proposed a facile one-pot synthesis of RuCo catalyst by hydrolysis of the metal precursors with NaBH4 solution, during which uniform dispersion and strong interaction of components can be obtained. We considered the Ru/Co ratio and H2 pre-treatment to be the critical factors and systematically studied their influences on the structural evolution and metal interaction of RuCo catalysts. Besides, we investigated the main reaction parameters including reaction temperature and time, catalyst mass and solvent effect, as well as catalyst separation and reuse. Based on that, we finally discussed the active site modeling and the plausible reaction mechanism."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O (98%) from Alfa Aesar, RuCl3⋅xH2O (>38% on Ru basis) from Innochem, and NaBH4 (98%) from Acros Organics were used for catalyst preparation. Furfural (FF, 99%), furfuryl alcohol (FA, 99%), 2-methylfuran (2-MF, 99%), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA, 99%), furan (99%), and isopropanol (i-PrOH, 99.9%) from Acros Organics were used for catalytic reaction and quantitative analysis."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation A series of RuCo composites with different Ru/Co molar ratios (i.e., 1/100−4/100) were synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrolysis method, as illustrated in Scheme 2 . Typically, a certain amount of Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O and RuCl3⋅xH2O were dissolved in 250 mL deionized water. And then, a freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (4 mg mL−1, n(NaBH4)/n(Ru + Co) = 5) was slowly added to the above metal solution under mechanical agitation (350 rpm) at room temperature for 2 h. The blackish green suspension was filtered and washed by excessive deionized water to remove Na+ and Cl− ions. The obtained filter cake was dried at 100 °C for 12 h to obtain the RuCo composite named as Ru X Co100 (x = 1, 2, 3 and 4). Co(OH)2 as reference was prepared by this protocol. Finally, the magnetic RuCo catalyst was obtained by reduction of the Ru X Co100 composite in H2 flow (20 mL min−1) typically at 350 °C (5 °C min−1) for 0.5 h (Scheme 2). The magnetic catalyst was named as (tH2)Ru X Co100, where t represented the reduction temperature, i.e., 200–450 °C with a step of 50 °C. The reference Co(OH)2 was reduced at 350 °C and named as (350H2)Co(OH)2."
4,Catalyst characterizations,"2.3 Catalyst characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Rigaku TTR III Diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a beam voltage of 40 kV. The patterns were recorded with a 2θ range of 10–90° and a measured speed of 0.1° s−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG) was carried out on a SDT Q600 thermal controller. The TGA curves were recorded in a range of 30–800 °C (heating rate of 10 °C min−1) under air. The heat flow data were dynamically normalized using the instantaneous weight of the sample at the respective temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Philips-FEI TECNAI F30 field emission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The mean size of Ru nanoparticles was estimated by measuring fifty Ru particles from a series of high resolution TEM graphs. Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 (H2-TPR) was conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem II chemisorption analyzer. The profiles were recorded in 5% H2/Ar (in vol., 30 mL min−1) mixed gas in a range of 50–800 °C (heating rate of 10 °C min−1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi apparatus equipped with Al Kα radiation under ultra-high vacuum. The binding energy shift caused by the surface charging was adjusted by a reference of C 1s line at 284.6 eV. Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT-IR) spectroscopy of CO adsorption was performed on a PerkinElmer Frontier FT-IR Spectrometer equipped with MCT detector and 10-cm Demountable Gas Cell (resolution: 4 cm−1, scan number: 32). The sample was first pre-treated in H2 flow (20 mL min−1) at 350 °C (5 °C min−1) for 30 min and then cooled down to 30 °C. Afterwards the solid was purged with Ar at 30 °C for 20 min to collect the background spectrum. Finally the sample was treated in pure CO (99.99%) flow at 30 °C for 60 min and then purged with Ar to remove the free CO before the record of spectrum."
5,Hydrogenation reaction,"2.4 Hydrogenation reaction Catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA was carried out in a batch-type Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The volumes of the autoclave and the Teflon container are 50 mL and 40 mL, respectively. Typically, 1 mmol FF, 30 mg catalyst and 5 mL i-PrOH were sealed in the container followed by removal of air in vacuum and in Ar flow. Subsequently, H2 was pumped till the pressure was stable at 1 bar. And then the reactor was placed in the oil-bath pre-heated at 120 °C under magnetic stirring of 900 rmp. It is confirmed that external and internal diffusion limitations can be excluded. After 4 h the reactor was immediately put into an ice bath to stop the reaction. And then the used catalyst was separated by magnet and completely washed by ethanol and water several times followed by drying at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 h and H2 treatment at 350 °C for 0.5 h before the next use. The liquid reaction solution was analyzed on a Thermo Scientific Trace 1310 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with TR-5 capillary column (length: 30 m, inner diameter: 0.32 mm, film: 0.25 μm) and FID detector. External standard method was used to quantify conversion of FF and selectivity of products based on the following equations. Specifically, FF, FA, 2-MF, furan, 2-MTHF and THFF were calibrated on the basis of the standard solutions at different concentrations. The obtained R2 factors were all higher than 0.999. Carbon balance was monitored for each reaction and the values were of 97–100%, which indicated that the reported catalytic results could be reliable, thus the data was not reported. Each reaction was repeated twice at least to guarantee a reproducible result, and the error of the data must be no more than 2%. Conv . ( % ) = n FF , 0 − n FF , t n FF , 0 × 100 % Select .

6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural evolution of RuCo catalysts,"3.1 Structural evolution of RuCo catalysts The bulk composition and structure of RuCo catalysts are first analyzed by ICP-MS and XRD. The Ru/Co molar ratio in bulk is found very close to the theoretical values (Table S1), showing an effective preparation of RuCo composites. Fig. 1 A shows the XRD patterns of Ru X CO100 composites as well as Co(OH)2. Hydrolysis of Co2+ salt by NaBH4 generates a typical Co(OH)2 phase, presenting the (004) plane due to α-Co(OH)2 and the (001), (100), (011), (012), (110) and (111) planes due to β-Co(OH)2 (JCPDS #74–1057) [25]. After Ru is added, the typical Co3O4 phase emerges in the Ru X CO100 composites with the co-existence of Co(OH)2. The Co3O4 patterns exhibit the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511), (440) and (533) planes (JCPDS #42–1467) [26]. When Ru content increases, the intensity of Co3O4 peaks becomes stronger while Co(OH)2 diffraction peaks appear weaker and even invisible for the Ru4Co100 composite. This suggests that the growing content of Ru in Ru X Co100 composites might be related with the transformation of Co(OH)2 to Co3O4. Notably, no Ru-related diffraction peak can be detected probably due to the low content and/or the high dispersion of Ru in the composites. There is no peak shift upon the Ru content. Fig. 1B shows the XRD patterns of Co(OH)2 reduced in H2 at 350 °C and the representative Ru3Co100 composite reduced at different temperatures. (350H2)Co(OH)2 exhibits mainly Co and CoO phases. The typical (100), (111), (101) and (220) planes due to metallic Co are identified (JCPDS #89–4307) [27]. Meanwhile CoO presents the characteristic (111) and (200) planes attributed to the rocksalt CoO (nanocubic crystal) and the (102) and (110) planes attributed to the wurtzite CoO (hexagonal pyramidal crystal) (JCPDS #75–0419) [28], respectively. A small amount of Co3O4 can be observed in (350H2)Co(OH)2 but it becomes barely visible for all the (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts. This phenomenon implies that Ru species can promote the reduction of Co3O4 in the Ru3Co100 composite during H2 reduction, which is consistent with the literature [29]. On the other hand (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts also show metallic Co and CoO phases. However, the intensities of them vary upon the reduction temperature yet the peak positions maintain. As expected, the Co diffraction peaks intensify while the CoO peaks weaken, with increasing reduction temperature from 250 to 450 °C. Ru-related diffraction peak still cannot be observed. It has to be emphasized that whatever reduction temperature is the (111) plane of CoO vanishes from the (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalyst as soon as Ru is present. This indicates that the (111) plane of CoO in the Ru3Co100 composite may be reduced during H2 treatment in co-presence of RuCo components. The thermal stability of RuCo catalysts are monitored by TGA analysis. Fig. S1 displays the TGA-DTG curves and weight loss data of Co(OH)2 and the Ru3Co100 composite. Both solids mainly exhibit three weighless stages distributed at about ≤130 °C, 130–210 °C, and 210–330 °C. The first two weight loss can be related with the evaporation of water molecules that are adsorbed on the catalyst surface and located between the catalyst layers, respectively. The third weightless stage is ascribed to the transformation of Co(OH)2 to Co3O4 [30]. Based on the XRD patterns (Fig. 1A), the weight percentages of Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 in the Ru3Co100 composite can be approximately calculated by comparing the third weightless stages of Co(OH)2 and Ru3Co100 using the given formulas (Fig. S1). The Co3O4 wt.% is estimated to be about 70%, showing Co3O4 phase to be dominant in the Ru3Co100 composite. Thus TGA result is in agreement with the structural evolution shown by XRD patterns. Compared with Co(OH)2, the Ru3Co100 composite presents the higher thermal stability (i.e., a shifted curve toward higher temperature), which is certainly caused by a stronger interaction between Ru and Co in the composite material. The microstructure and morphology of RuCo catalysts are further examined by TEM. Fig. 2 a and b show the TEM images of the representative Ru3Co100 composite. The hexagonal thin-layer plate-like structure can be assigned to Co(OH)2 while the nanosphere structure can be ascribed to Co3O4. Ru nanoparticles with a mean size less than 3 nm can be observed to be highly dispersed in the composite (see experimental details). Some inter-planar distances can be measured from the HR-TEM image. The values of 0.248, 0.286 and 0.467 nm are identical to the (311), (220) and (111) planes of Co3O4 [31,32], while the value of 0.230 nm is characteristic of the (100) plane of Ru nanoparticles [33]. Fig. 2c and d display the TEM images of the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst. After H2 treatment at 350 °C the morphology of the Ru3Co100 composite has obviously changed. Typical nanocubic-like and hexagonal pyramidal particles are observed, which can correspond to the rocksalt and wurtzite CoO particles [28], respectively. Meanwhile Co3O4 nanospheres and Ru nanoparticles co-exist in the catalyst, and the latter one maintains the small particle size and high dispersion. HR-TEM image well shows the inter-planar distances of 0.203, 0.213 and 0.230 nm which are identical to the (111) plane of metallic Co, the (200) of CoO [34], and the (100) plane of Ru, respectively. Notably, the (111) plane of CoO is not found. The TEM inspection is well consistent with the XRD results, offering us the direct observation of the construction of (350H2)Ru3Co100 during catalyst preparation. One-pot hydrolysis of Ru and Co salts by NaBH4 at room temperature can synthesize Co(OH)2-Co3O4 composite supported Ru nanoparticles, and the subsequent H2 treatment leads to the formation of CoO–Co3O4 composite oxide supported RuCo bimetallic sites with the unique magnetic property. This preparation methodology allows Ru nanoparticles to closely interact with Co species in the final catalyst."
8,Strong interaction between bimetallic RuCo active sites,"3.2 Strong interaction between bimetallic RuCo active sites The reductive property of RuCo catalysts is carefully studied by H2-TPR. Fig. 3 A displays the TPR profiles of Co(OH)2 and the Ru3Co100 composite, while Fig. 3B reports the profiles of (350H2)Co(OH)2 and (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts. All the reduction curves can be roughly divided into three domains. The peaks located at ≤ 200 °C correspond to the reduction of cationic Ruδ+ to metallic Ru0 [35,36]. While the peaks located at about 210–400 °C and 400–600 °C can be due to the successive reduction of Co3O4 → CoO → Co [31,37]. The pristine Co(OH)2 presents two groups of reduction peaks at about 239, 268, 317 °C and 449, 505, 577 °C, related with the reduction of Co3O4 and CoO, respectively. These small deconvoluted peaks were attributed in literature to the reduction of Co species on the catalyst surface and/or shallower locations [38]. In the Ru3Co100 composite Co ions are found easier to be reduced. The reduction peaks of Co oxides shift to lower temperatures and the H2 consumption decreases to half of Co(OH)2 (Fig. S2). This phenomenon is thought to be due to the close interaction between Ru and Co. It was previously demonstrated for a Ru–Co/SiO2 catalyst that metallic Ru can effectively promote the reduction of Co2+ species via hydrogen-spillover effect [29]. (350H2)Co(OH)2 presents two peaks centered at about 390 and 530 °C related with the reduction of Co3+ and Co2+ ions, respectively. However, the temperatures are found higher than those usually needed to reduce the single-phase Co3O4 [31,37]. This reflects an influence of the hetero-structure of (350H2)Co(OH)2 as shown by XRD (Fig. 1B). As expected, the reduction temperatures for Co3O4 and CoO significantly decrease after the addition of Ru and H2 consumption during TPR dramatically drops (Fig. S2), which is due to an enhanced hydrogen-spillover effect. Meanwhile the reduction of Ruδ+ species and Co oxides in the (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts becomes gradually difficult as the temperature of H2 treatment increases. This indicates a growing interaction between Ru and Co. Notably whatever the H2 treatment is the reduction temperatures of Ruδ+ species and Co oxides in (tH2)Ru3Co100 are still higher than the typical values from the reference solids, showing a good retention of RuCo metal interaction. The surface composition and property of RuCo catalysts are analyzed by XPS. Fig. 4 shows the spectra of Ru 3p3/2 and Co 2p3/2 core levels for Ru X Co100 composites. The BEs at about 462.5 and 465.7 eV are consistent with Ru0 and Ruδ+ species reported in literature [33,39]. The BE and surface proportion of Ru0 shift to higher values with increasing the Ru content, and an optimum can be obtained on Ru3Co100 (Table S1). For Co 2p3/2 spectra the BEs at about 779.7 and 780.5 eV are identical to Co3+ and Co2+ species in Co3O4 [40] while 781.5 eV to Co2+ species in Co(OH)2 [41]. The characteristic satellite peaks due to Co2+ and Co3+ are also observed and consistent with the XRD patterns upon the Ru/Co ratio. Accordingly, surface oxygen species due to the typical lattice oxygen (ca. 529.5 eV), surface unsaturated oxygen (ca. 531.2 eV) and oxygen in OH group (ca. 533.1 eV) are present (Fig. S3) [42–45]. There is a shift to lower BE for Co peaks with increasing the Ru content (Table S1). Hence surface charge can transfer from Ru to Co in Ru X Co100 composites, leading to a stronger metal interaction in the Ru3Co100 composite. This is in agreement with the promoted reduction of cobalt oxides in presence of Ru as shown in H2-TPR (Fig. 3A). Fig. 5 shows the spectra of Ru 3p3/2 and Co 2p3/2 core levels for (350H2)Co(OH)2 and (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts. After H2 treatment the BEs of Ru0 species obviously shift to lower values (461.7–461.9 eV) with increasing reduction temperature and well correspond to Ru0 species in Ru supported on mixed oxides [35]. This reveals the formation of electron-rich metallic Ru site and the surface proportion of Ru0 as expected goes up to about 85% (Table S2). The Co 2p3/2 spectra present four peaks that can be respectively ascribed to metallic Co0 (778.0 eV) [46], cationic Co3+ (ca. 780.1 eV) and Co2+ (ca. 782.1 eV) species in the heterostructured CoO–Co3O4 nanoparticles [47], and the satellite peaks of Co2+ (in consistent with XRD patterns in Fig. 1B), which is in agreement with the O 1s spectra (Fig. S4). As expected, the surface proportion of Co0 increases from 1% up to 10% as the treatment temperature rises, while the BEs of Co ions are found shifting to higher values (Table S2). This can reflect the growing metal interaction between Ru and Co due to charge transfer from Co to Ru, also in agreement with the increasing reduction temperatures for Ru species and cobalt oxides in H2-TPR results (Fig. 3B). To be noted, Ru species are found to apparently segregate to the outer surface of RuCo catalysts due to the easier reduction of Ru in the reductive medium (Tables S1–2), i.e., NaBH4 and H2. The RuCo metal interaction is further studied by DRIFT-IR using CO as probe molecule on Ru3Co100 (350H2)Co(OH)2 and (350H2)Ru3Co100. This technique can provide informative and sensitive analysis on only the exposed surface Ru and Co sites. As shown in Fig. 6 , the H2-reduced (350H2)Co(OH)2 and (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalysts exhibit spectra analogue to that of the Ru3Co100 precursor, of which two intense adsorption bands at about 2120 and 2171 cm−1 are observed. The band at lower frequency is usually attributed to linearly adsorbed CO on Co2+ sites, while the band at higher frequency can be assigned to the linear adsorption of CO on coordinatively unsaturated Co3+ sites [48]. Moreover, the CO adsorption peaks of (350H2)Ru3Co100 slightly shift to higher frequency, which implies the charge transfer from Co to Ru. Interestingly, on the Ru3Co100 precursor two groups of adsorption bands are clearly observed, which can be due to the typical CO adsorptions on the surface OH groups and H2O molecules of the solid [49,50]. This is in good agreement with the feature of Ru3Co100. Although it was reported that Co may adsorb on the partially oxidized Ruδ+ sites through tricarbonyl species (i.e., Ruδ+(CO)3), the typical bands at 2074 and 2138 cm−1 cannot be identified due to overlapping by Co band [51]. To be emphasized, a very small peak at 2036 cm−1 can be extracted, which was ascribed in literature to CO adsorbed on metallic Co0 or Ru0 sites in a linear geometry [52]. But this peak cannot be found for the Ru3Co100 precursor. Therefore, XPS and DRIFT-IR results are well consistent and reveal the co-existence of metallic RuCo sites and Co2+/Co3+ species on surface of the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst, and Ru0 and Co0 nanoparticles are found in close interaction."
9,Catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA,"3.3 Catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA Fig. S5 shows the influence of Ru ratio in Ru X Co100 composites on their catalytic performances. Co(OH)2 in absence of Ru is found to be inactive for hydrogenation of FF while conversion of FF almost linearly increases (23 → 70%) in proportional to the Ru content up to 3 mol%, and then slightly decreases at 4 mol% Ru. Selectivity of FA is independent on the Ru/Co ratio and stabilizes at 100% without by-product formation. This indicates that Ru is the catalytic active component in Ru X Co100 composites for hydrogenation of FF to FA. Thereby, the Ru content is fixed at 3 mol%. Fig. S6 shows the influence of treatment temperature in H2 for (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts on their catalytic performances. The initial conversion rate of the (200H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst is about two folds than that of the untreated Ru3Co100 composite (5.0 vs 10.3 mmolFF h−1 gcat. −1). The reaction rate gradually increases (10.3 → 12.7 mmolFF h−1 gcat. −1) in proportional to the reduction temperature between 200 and 350 °C, followed by a quick decline from 400 °C. Selectivity of FA always retains at 100%. These results show the important roles of Ru content and H2 pre-treatment in determining the activity of RuCo catalysts, and the optimal (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst is obtained. It is disclosed that higher Ru content and reduction temperature may result in lower catalytic activity, probably due to the aggregation of active Ru and/or Co particles (Tables S1–2) to weaken the adsorption of FF [17,53]. However, it could be also assumed that Ru diffuses into the sublayer and therefore the catalyst is not so active. This can be supported by the TPR curve of (450H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst the reduction peak due to surface Ru becomes barely detectable. Notably, XPS technique detects not only the topmost layer but also the sublayer of a solid. Fig. 7 reports the time-course data and the Arrhenius plot of FF conversion for the (350H2)Co(OH)2 and (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts. A controlled experiment is performed on the optimal (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst in i-PrOH under Ar instead of H2, and no activity is obtained. This confirms that molecular H2 is the sole hydrogen donor for FF hydrogenation. Conversions over all the catalysts are found globally increasing during FF hydrogenation (Fig. 7a). Specifically, conversion over (350H2)Ru3Co100 and (250H2)Ru3Co100 reaches a plateau at about 92% and 84% after 4 h, respectively. While conversion over (450H2)Ru3Co100 and (350H2)Co(OH)2 presents slower and continuous increase during 6 h, reaching about 60% and 56%, respectively. Meanwhile, FA is observed as the main product and the selectivity can reach 98% and 91% for the (tH2)Ru3Co100 and (350H2)Co(OH)2 catalysts, respectively (Fig. 7b). With increasing conversion of FF and reaction time, the produced FA could be further transformed on the (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts to 2-MF (max. 2%) via hydrogenolysis (Fig. 7c). While the reference (350H2)Co(OH)2 catalyst shows a time-independent products distribution, i.e., FA (91%), 2-MF (6%) and unknown products (3%). These results indicate that Co in addition to Ru is also the catalytic active site in (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts for hydrogenation of FF to FA, and the bimetallic RuCo active centers show an enhanced activity and selectivity. Hydrogenation of FF to FA can be considered as the pseudo first-order reaction according to previous reports [54,55]. Hence the apparent activation energies (E a) of the (350H2)Co(OH)2 and (tH2)Ru3Co100 catalysts are calculated by the numerical regression by assuming a valid Arrhenius law (Table S3). The E a values of catalysts are well consistent with their catalytic performances. The reference (350H2)Co(OH)2 catalyst exhibits a highest E a of 80 kJ mol−1 whereas the optimal (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst presents a lowest one of 63 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 7d). This well shows that (350H2)Ru3Co100 is most active among the series catalysts, and the cooperative RuCo active sites are essential to effectively activate and convert FF to FA. Fig. 8 displays the solvent effect on the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst for FF hydrogenation during 2 h. Some typical organic solvents as well as water are investigated. It is shown that reaction solvents strongly affect both conversion of FF and distribution of products. For instance, the highest selectivity to FA is achieved in water (100%) and i-PrOH (98%) at moderate conversion of FF (48 and 59%). While moderate to high conversion of FF (ca. 60–80%) can be obtained in C1–C4 primary alcohols, but selectivity to FA is similarly of about 60% together with some unknown products (ca. 40%). The complex solvent effect on different catalytic performances is thought to be related with the solvent properties, such as polarity, reactivity of FF with solvent, capacity to dissolve H2 and so forth. It was demonstrated that due to a strong adsorption of FF on an α-MoC catalyst in H2O or i-PrOH higher conversion can be expected and the solvent restrained the hydrogenolysis of FA to 2-MF [56]. For the C1–C4 primary alcohols, it was disclosed on supported-Pt catalysts that selectivity to FA decreased with increasing solvent chain length, probably to yield the undesired acetal side product [57]. Low-to non-polar solvents such as dioxane, octane and toluene either lead to very low conversion or poor selectivity, which was previously attributed to the poor hydrogen solubility under ambient pressure in those solvents [15,57]. Thus i-PrOH and water are suitable solvents for the present catalytic system, yet i-PrOH offers higher activity by compromising slightly of FA slightly down to 98%. Following that the influence of reaction temperature and catalyst mass is investigated on the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 9 . Both parameters are found to mainly affect the activity of catalyst. Conversion of FF almost linearly goes up from about 30% to 93% at 100–120 °C while selectivity of FA retains at 98% (Fig. 9a). By further raising the temperature to 140 °C the conversion is stabilized at 93% but selectivity of FA declines to 94% with a growing formation of 2-MF (6%). It has been disclosed in literature that a high reaction temperature may induce over-hydrogenation of FA to by-products [13,18]. Similarly, the increase of FF conversion is observed strongly dependent on the catalyst mass used (Fig. 9b). This can reflect a relatively uniform distribution of active sites in the catalyst and also an effective mass transfer in the reactor. Notably, minor 2-MF (2%) can be generated with adding more catalyst (i.e., conv. FF ≥ 50%), as already observed in the time course tests (Fig. 7). Therefore, the developed (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst can reach 98% yield to FA in i-PrOH under ambient H2 pressure at 120 °C within 4 h, and even achieve 100% yield in water by simply adding more catalyst (40 mg). Compared to Ru and Co benchmark catalysts reported in literature (Table 1), the present (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst is the only one that can achieve 100% yield of FA at ambient H2 pressure with fast respond and stable activity. Fig. 10 a shows the recycling test of the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst during hydrogenation of FF in water. The used catalyst (see experimental details) exhibits an excellent stability under the optimized reaction conditions during three consecutive recycling uses. The leaching tests for both (350H2)Co(OH)2 and (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalysts after hot filtration show unchanged activities (Fig. S6). This suggests no loss of Co or Ru active component from the catalyst into the reaction mixture. This observation is directly supported by ICP-MS analysis on the post-reaction solution. To rationally avoid the possible saturation of catalytic activity when conversion and selectivity reach 100%, the recycling test within the kinetic-controlled region is conducted (Fig. 10a). The result confirms the considerable stability and reusability of the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst. More importantly, the used catalyst can be easily and completely separated from the reaction solution by a magnet (Fig. 10b). The magnetic hysteresis loops of the catalysts at room temperature are displayed in Fig. 11 b. The specific magnetization is measured to be 66.0 and 100.7 emu g−1 for (350H2)Co(OH)2 and (350H2)Ru3Co100 respectively, which confirms the good magnetic property at room temperature and the ease in physical separation by external magnetic field. The magnetism of (350H2)Ru3Co100 is originated from (350H2)Co(OH)2, but of which specific magnetization can be promoted by RuCo metal interaction."
10,Discussion on active site modeling and plausible reaction mechanism,"3.4 Discussion on active site modeling and plausible reaction mechanism Fig. 11 compares the catalytic performances of various Co-based and RuCo catalysts. The pristine Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 are found inactive. While the pure CoO only affords a very low selectivity of FA (6%) at 20% conversion of FF. The main products include the over-hydrogenated compounds (2-MF + THFA: 52%), decarbonylated compound (furan: 27%) and other unknown products (15%). However, H2-treated (350H2)Co(OH)2 can provide a much higher selectivity of FA (91%) at also a higher conversion of FF (34%). Other products are 2-MF (3%) and THFA (6%). Thereby, it can be deduced that metallic Co is the active site for FF hydrogenation to FA. It has been shown for supported-Co catalysts that Co0 nanoparticles are responsible for hydrogenation of FF to FA [17,18]. Meanwhile, Ru3/Co3O4 and Ru3/CoO reference catalysts are also investigated. Rather low conversion of FF at 4% and 7% is measured respectively, whereas selectivity of FA can reach 100%. This indicates that the co-presence of Ru and Co oxide is critical to achieve an excellent selectivity of FA, but the form of combination is decisive for conversion of FF. On the other hand, the Ru3Co100 composite enables to selectively convert FF to FA without any by-product at an obviously higher conversion of FF (70%), and more, the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst can further promote the conversion up to 93% with formation of FA (98%) and 2-MF (2%). This well demonstrates that Ru0 in addition to Co0 can be the major active site for highly active and selective conversion of FF to FA, the small amount of 2-MF can be related with the CoO phase in catalyst and/or the solvent effect. It is well known that metallic Ru nanoparticles show high activity for hydrogenation reactions and its superior performance for FF hydrogenation has been reported [7,16]. Moreover, only after H2 treatment the (350H2)Co(OH)2 and (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalysts exhibit magnetism. Based on the catalyst characterizations and catalytic results, the active site modeling of the RuCo catalyst (e.g., (350H2)Ru3Co100) and the reaction mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation of FF can be illustrated. XRD, TEM, TPR and XPS show the co-existence and high dispersion of Ru0 and Co0 nanoparticles on CoO–Co3O4 composite in the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst. It is reasonable to propose the bimetallic Ru0–Co0 centers to be the catalytic active sites, as shown in Scheme 3 . TPR, XPS and DRIFT-IR reveal the strong metal interaction between metallic Ru and Co centers due to a charge transfer from Co to Ru. Such induced electron-rich Ru0 sites have been reported highly efficient to adsorb and activate CO group [58], while Co0 sites are renowned for the high capability of H2 adsorption and activation [17,47]. It was recently demonstrated for a Co/ZrLa0.2O Y catalyst that selective hydrogenation of FF follows the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism [17]. In this work, the controlled experiment confirms H2 to be the sole hydrogen donor, hence catalytic hydrogenation of FF requires the adsorption and subsequent activation of H2 on the Ru0–Co0 active sites. Meanwhile DRIFT-IR shows strong adsorption of CO bond on both Ru0 and Co0/δ+ sites. Therefore, it can be deduced that catalytic hydrogenation of FF over the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst also undergoes the L-H mechanism, in which FF and H2 are simultaneously adsorbed on the free Ru0–Co0 active sites, as illustrated in Scheme 3. This is then followed by the actual surface reaction between the neighboring chemisorbed FF and H2 molecules to produce FA, adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The cooperative Ru0 and Co0 active sites can synergistically enhance FF conversion by significantly lowering the apparent E a of hydrogenation. Moreover, the co-presence of RuCo metals may facilitate a complete reduction of the (111) plane of CoO in the catalyst to the active Co0 (111) sites during H2 treatment, as shown by XRD and TEM. It was observed that FF exhibited a strong adsorption on the (111) plane of CO, resulting in over-hydrogenation of the produced FA to by-products [19]. Notably, the magnetism of the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst is also originated from the heterostructure of (350H2)Co(OH)2 after H2 treatment, and the strong RuCo metal interaction can further strengthen the specific magnetization. In the final step the produced FA is desorbed from the catalyst surface and the Ru0–Co0 active sites can be regenerated by post-treatment."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, the magnetic RuCo bimetallic active sites were rationally constructed for the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol under ambient H2 pressure. One-pot hydrolysis of Ru and Co salts by NaBH4 solution may prepare the RuCo composite material, and further treatment with H2 can yield the RuCo magnetic catalyst. The Ru/Co molar ratio and H2-treatment temperature were found to be critical factors to modulate the structural evolution and RuCo metal interaction that were decisive for furfural conversion and products distribution. The optimal (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst achieved full conversion of furfural and 98–100% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol using i-PrOH or water as solvent at 120 °C and 1 bar H2 after 4 h. Bimetallic Ru0–Co0 centers were the catalytic active sites for selective conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol using molecular H2 as hydrogen donor. The electron-sufficient Ru0 sites were induced owing to the strong metal interaction between Ru0 and Co0 centers, such active sites enabled to efficiently adsorb and activate carbonyl group of furfural and H2 molecule via low activation energy. The synergistic Ru0–Co0 active sites in close interaction realized an obvious enhancement in furfural conversion and furfuryl alcohol selectivity, and eliminated from the catalyst the CoO (111) sites that were responsible for over-hydrogenated side reactions. More importantly, the (350H2)Ru3Co100 catalyst showed considerable stability and can be rapidly separated from reaction solution by an external magnetic field. This work would shed a light on developing new magnetic catalysts for selective hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds."
