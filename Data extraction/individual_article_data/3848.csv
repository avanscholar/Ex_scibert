0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production from water attracts significant attention of researchers working to transform solar energy into chemical energy of fuel [1–3]. After the work of Fujishima and Honda [4], studies on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water have been actively performed. To achieve this goal, scientists create new catalysts and new photocatalytic systems. Nowadays there are many photocatalysts for hydrogen production under ultraviolet and visible light [5–10]. Among them, TiO2 is the most studied and used photocatalyst because it is photostable, harmless to the environment, active and cheap. Therefore, TiO2-based photocatalysts are promising for hydrogen generation from water [8]. Platinum co-catalyst is usually required for hydrogen generation under UV irradiation. There are two major problems in photocatalytic water splitting: low quantum efficiency and separation of oxygen and hydrogen products. The first problem is approached by creating efficient charge separation and highly active H2 and O2 evolution co-catalysts. Separation of products generated in the oxidation and reduction stages requires physical separation of the centers of reduction and oxidation. Z-scheme mimicking is often used for this purpose [5,7–12]. The Z-scheme of photosynthesis includes two photosystems, for water oxidation and CO2 reduction, located in different places on lipid membrane. The Z-scheme for water splitting consists of two photocatalysts both absorbing light and driving oxidation and reduction reactions on their surfaces. Redox couple is used for charge transport between the photocatalysts. The water splitting reaction requires eight quanta to evolve 2H2 and O2. Another possible way for separating gaseous products consists in using membrane photocatalytic systems (MPS), which carry out the processes of oxidation and reduction over different sides of membrane on the same photocatalyst. Thus the electrons must travel from one side of the membrane to the other side, and four quanta are needed to evolve 2H2 + O2. The photocatalytic system should also have a path to equalize the charges. Examples of such systems are very scarce. Anpo et al. [13–15] carried out photocatalytic water splitting on the layer-by-layer membrane system consisting of vis-TiO2 thin film, Ti foil substrate and a layer of Pt particles. The charge equilibration occurred by proton transport via a Nafion film. Another approach was implemented using Nafion film as a platform for hydrogen generation [16]. Pores of Nafion contained charge carriers, which transferred electrons from an EDTA solution on one side of the film to the platinum particles located at the ends of pores on another side of the film. Thus, hydrogen generation with sacrificial donor EDTA was observed. Another type of membrane system described in the literature is represented by microheterogeneous structures such as micelles, vesicles and micro-emulsions. They mimic natural cell and chloroplast conditions which realize charge separation across membranes and the possibility of decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. However, these systems are difficult for practical applications [17,18]. The last found system contained microcrystals of CdS embedded in polyurethane film [19]. The microcrystals pierced the film and formed contact with the solutions on sides of the film. Unfortunately, all MPS proposed so far are not efficient for practical water splitting due to low quantum efficiencies and necessity to apply external voltage or chemical bias. So the study of this subject should be continued together with the development of photocatalysts for visible light to produce an efficient photocatalytic system, which generates pure hydrogen from water under solar light. In the present work, we propose a MPS based on a porous polymeric membrane as the substrate for impregnation of active components. Fig. 1 presents the basic idea of the MPS being developed. The membrane is impregnated with TiO2 photocatalyst and with reduction as well as oxidation co-catalysts deposited on different sides of the membrane. Efficient separation of photogenerated charges and water splitting products on the different sides of the membrane should be achieved in this way. This article only describes the first stage of MPS development giving TiO2-loaded membrane with reduction co-catalyst Pt. The goal of this study was to develop preparation methods and study the MPS for hydrogen production from water on the basis of porous polymer membrane using sacrificial electron donor and TiO2 photocatalyst. The composition of Pt/TiO2 composite was optimized, methods of its attachment developed and kinetics of hydrogen evolution measured in a created two-compartment membrane photocatalytic reactor. The results demonstrate good promise for development of this type of MPS."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials For MPS preparation, TiO2 Hombifine N (H–N, Sachtleben Chemie GbmH, 100% anatase, primary particle size about 5–10 nm), and Degussa P25 (DP25, 75% anatase, 25% rutile, primary particles size about 35–50 nm) were used. Acetone and hexane were “Reachim” products and used as received. The following chemicals were used: TiOSO4 from “VEKTON”, H2SO4 from “ANT” and H2PtCl6 from “Aurat”. Pt/TiO2 (1%, SR) was prepared by soft chemical reduction of H2PtCl6 in TiO2 suspension as described in [11]. PTFE filter MFFK-3 (NPO ""Technofiltr"") with reinforced polypropylene support was chosen as a substrate. This membrane consists of a small pore Teflon filtering layer with the declared characteristic penetration particle size of 450 nm and a reinforcing polypropylene fiber layer. Hydrophobic membranes MFFK-3 with diameter 47 mm and thickness of about 125 μm were used for MPS preparation. The PTFE filters have good chemical resistance and UV light stability [20]. The reinforced membrane support gives good mechanical durability to MPS."
3,MPS preparation,"2.2 MPS preparation 2.2.1 Impregnation of membrane with TiO2 photocatalysts The photocatalysts DP25, H–N, Pt/TiO2(1%, SR) were loaded on MFFK-3 membrane by vacuum filtration using a specially crafted filtering attachment. The attachment is a Teflon Buchner funnel equipped with gaskets and screw for fixing the membrane. The attachment is connected to a water-jet vacuum pump. The photocatalyst suspension for coating to the membrane was prepared by mixing the photocatalyst with distilled water for 20 min followed by ultrasonic treatment for 5 min. Ultrasonic treatment was carried out in an ultrasonic bath E15 (Elmasonic). After preparation of the photocatalyst suspension, the coating was carried out by three different ways: 1) the suspension was under continuous influence of ultrasound and was moved bottom-up to the filter placed (method BUU); 2) the suspension was moved to the filter bottom-up without ultrasound (method BU); 3) the suspension was moved to the filter top-down (method TD). Before filtration, the membrane was wetted with ethanol (96%) to impart hydrophilic properties. Uniformity of membrane loading with TiO2 by BUU filtration procedure depends strongly on position of the filtering attachment in the ultrasound field. It was important to keep the membrane away from strong cavitation part of ultrasonic field to avoid removal of TiO2 from the membrane by ultrasound. After filtration some membranes were scraped from excess of titanium dioxide by a rotating stir bar on the membrane surface. In order to do this, the membrane was placed on the bottom of a petri dish with sufficient amount of water to cover it. After the procedure, the membrane surface was washed by distilled water to remove TiO2 suspension. As a result of many experiments it was observed that the coating of catalysts (H-N and DP25) by BUU often gives membrane weight change higher than amount of TiO2 added. However, the coating by BU and TD does not give higher values of weight change. Hence, we can conclude that the increased weight change was due to the impact of ultrasound. One would think that water remains inside the pores of the membrane, but drying in an oven at 80 °C for 5 h had to remove the water. It is assumed that ultrasound destroys the filtration attachment and the resulting Teflon particles are deposited on the membrane. 2.2.2 TiO2 chemical bath deposition and aging Two methods of chemical deposition of TiO2 on membranes were applied. The first method was hydrolysis of titanium (IV) tetrabutoxide (TTB) solution on the initial membrane without photocatalyst. The membrane was impregnated with TTB solution in different organic anhydrous solvents and then they were hydrolyzed by atmospheric moisture or by dropwise added water. The solvents used were acetone and hexane. Concentration of TTB ranged from 10% to 100% by volume. The experiments have shown loss of mechanical properties of membranes. After wetting the membrane with TTB solution in hexane or acetone and exposing it to ambient air or water it was gradually covered by TiO2 film. After drying, the membranes were covered with a white precipitate on both sides, but were deformed and decreased in size. The second method of TiO2 loading was chemical bath deposition (CBD) that was used for attaching TiO2 loaded by filtration to the membranes. Membranes were fixed to a Plexiglas support and dipped into the solution containing 0.1 M H2SO4 and various concentrations of TiOSO4 from 0.5 to 5.8 mM. The solution was stirred continuously and heated to different temperatures for various time periods. Five identical membranes loaded with 2 mg of DP25 by method BUU were chemically loaded with 3 mg of TiO2 method CBD and further used to investigate the influence of aging on the rate of hydrogen production. The aging was done in a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution during 0.5–8 h. 2.2.3 Photocatalytic deposition of platinum on TiO2 The membrane reactor shown in Fig. 2 was used for photocatalytic (PC) platinum deposition on TiO2. The reactor consists of two main parts with a membrane installed between the parts dividing the internal space into illuminated compartment (IC) with volume 60 ml and non-illuminated compartment (NC) with volume 80 ml. The two compartments served for separation of oxidation and reduction products. Quartz windows are attached to sides and gas tanks are attached to the tops of IC and NC. The light source was a DRSh-1000 lamp (NPP “Razryad”, Russia) and it was used with and without a cut-off filter BS-7(FGUPZ “Krasniy Gigant”, Russia) absorbing light with λ < 345 nm (Fig. 3 ). H2PtCl6 solution of different concentration was used as the Pt precursor and ethanol solution as the electron donor. pH of solution was adjusted by HCl addition, the IC was either purged with Ar or left without purging and NC was not purged. The experimental conditions of experiments for Pt photodeposition on TiO2 loaded membranes (TiO2/MFFK-3) are presented in Table 1 . In experiment #1, platinum was deposited everywhere in the IC of the membrane reactor. Such behavior is indicative of photolysis of H2PtCl6 under ultraviolet irradiation in ethanol presence [21,22] which completes with photocatalytic reduction reaction of H2PtCl6 on the TiO2 particles. To decrease absorption of light by H2PtCl6 at 262 nm and thereby increase the probability of the photocatalytic reaction, experiment #2 was performed under irradiation with λ > 345 nm but Pt was deposited everywhere in IC again. Thus, photochemical reduction of H2PtCl6 proceeds too. It is known that H2PtCl6 exists in Pt(OH)2Cl4 form at pH above 2, hydrolysis equilibration is accelerated by UV illumination [23] and this form can be photolyzed into Pt-containing deposites. Therefore, pH was decreased for all further experiments of Pt photodeposition. In experiment # 3, at pH 2 we obtained photocatalytic deposition of platinum because Pt was loaded on TiO2/MFFK-3 and the distribution of Pt corresponds to the light spot. However, some platinum was applied to the reactor walls as well. After experiment #4 at even lower pH 1.4, platinum was deposited on the membrane only and nothing was deposited on the reactor walls. In the experiment #5, ethanol solution was in the IC together with H2PtCl6. As a result, more intensive dark deposit on the membrane was obtained. Thus, photocatalytic deposition of platinum requires pH < 1.5 and presence of the cut-off filter BS-7. All further Pt photodeposition experiments were conducted with a uniform distribution of light. To do this, the light filtered with BS-7 filter was used with total incident radiant power 0.05 W on the membrane, and platinum was deposited uniformly on the membranes. To determine the dependence of the rate of hydrogen evolution on the platinum content, series of experiments were carried out using membranes prepared under different conditions of platinum photodeposition. Variable parameters were the illumination time and the H2PtCl6 concentration. Photodeposition of Pt on membranes with TiO2 loaded by CBD was carried out in the following conditions: IC content - 0.078 mM H2PtCl6, 6% (vol.) ethanol, 0.05 M HCl with pH = 1.3, NC – empty; atmosphere in IC and NC was Ar, irradiation with the BS-7 filter, the illumination time 40 min. These conditions were found to be optimal in the experiments of Pt photodeposition described above. The conditions provide a sufficient quantity of Pt for reaching high hydrogen production rate."
4,MPS characterization,"2.3 MPS characterization To assess and compare the composition of the surface of TiO2 and Pt loaded membranes, diffuse reflection spectra were recorded on a UV/VIS spectrophotometer Lambda 35 (Perkin Elmer) using a diffuse reflectance attachment. The spectra were measured using pure MFFK-3 membrane as the reference. Comparison of the surface content of TiO2 and Pt in membranes was carried out using diffuse reflectance at 300 and 1100 nm, respectively. The surface content of TiO2 was estimated applying the fact that at 300 nm the pure membrane reflection is 100% and the reflection of the membrane completely covered with TiO2 is 0%. The permeability of the prepared MPS was assessed by measuring the leakage time (LT) of a certain volume of water under vacuum created by a vacuum diaphragm pump. 54 ml were poured into the filtration attachment connected through a Bunsen flask to the pump. The platinum content in MPS was measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer Optima 4300 DV (Perkin Elmer). The layer of catalyst was scraped from the membrane and platinum was dissolved in nitrohydrochloric acid. The dissolved platinum solution was brought to 100 ml and used for measurement. The measurement error ranged from 3 to 9 rel.% depending on the Pt content. The morphology of the initial membrane and MPS created was studied with scanning electron microscopy. The loading of photocatalysts on the MPS was measured using balances AlC-320d3 (“ACCULAB”) and LV-210A (""SARTOGOSM"") with weighing error 0.001 and 0.0001 g, respectively."
5,Hydrogen production,"2.4 Hydrogen production Hydrogen production experiments were carried out in the membrane reactor shown in Fig. 2. Two ways of filling the reactor with the reagents were used for checking mass transport effects in hydrogen production. In the first way, the solution of 6 vol.% of ethanol in water was placed in both compartments. In the second way, IC was filled with the 6 vol.% ethanol solution while the NC was left empty. Before the experiments, both compartments were purged with Ar at flow rate of about 30 ml/min for 40 min. Analysis of H2 was performed using a gas chromatograph LHM-8 (USSR) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The error of hydrogen concentration measurement was about 5%. CO2 and organic compounds were analyzed on an activated carbon filled column attached to a methanizer and a flame ionization detector of the chromatograph LHM-8. The error of measurement was about 5%. The membrane reactor was irradiated from the irradiated compartment side. Two irradiation levels adjusted by the distance between the lamp and the reactor were used in hydrogen production experiments. In the first one, incident radiant power was 2.12 W for the full light, 1.34 W for the light with λ > 345 nm (filter BS-7), 1.20 W for the light with λ > 415 nm (filter ZhS-11 in Fig. 3, FGUPZ “Krasniy Gigant, Russia). In the second irradiation level, the incident radiant power was 0.76 W for the full light, 0.48 W for the light with λ > 345 nm (filter BS-7), 0.43 W for the light with λ > 415 nm (filter ZhS-11). The measurement of light intensity was conducted by the μV m F-136 (Russia) equipped with the semiconductor light intensity detector calibrated to the ferrioxalate actinometer. Quantum efficiency of hydrogen production was calculated by dividing the number of electrons in the produced hydrogen by the number of incident photons that have sufficient energy for the photoexcitation using the next equation. φ = 2 · N ( H 2 ) N ( hν ) · 100 % , where N(H2) is the quantity of hydrogen produced (mol), N(hν) is the quantity of photons incident during the reaction (mol). The number of such photons was estimated by assuming wavelength 365 nm which is a major emission line in UV region for DRSh-1000 lamp (Fig. 3) according to the following equation. N ( hν ) = P λ t hc N A , where P is the incident UV radiant power (W), λ is the main UV light wavelength (365·10−9 m), t is the reaction time (s), h is the Plank's constant (6.63·10−34 J s), c is the speed of light (3·108 m/s), N A is the Avogardo number (6.022·1023 mol−1)."
6,Results and discussion,"About 220 membranes were prepared during this research. The membranes differed in properties such as TiO2 deposition method, TiO2 type, weight of TiO2 loaded by filtration and CBD, photocatalyst aging time, platinum deposition conditions and content. The membranes were characterized and used for experiments on hydrogen production."
7,Characterization of membranes,"3.1 Characterization of membranes Membranes prepared were studied according to the following characteristics: mass of TiO2 loaded, mechanical strength, permeability to water, diffuse reflectance, platinum content, morphology and texture. The following sections describe the characteristics of membranes and the influence of preparation conditions on the membrane properties. 3.1.1 Amount of TiO2 in membranes The amount of titanium dioxide loaded on MFFK-3 membrane was calculated as the difference between the mass of membrane after and before the deposition by filtration with drying. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that an amount of TiO2 loaded equal to 2 mg is adequate for covering the pores of the membrane almost completely. Diffuse reflection spectra of such TiO2 loaded membrane show about 10% reflection in the UV region, which means that about 90% of the membrane surface is covered with TiO2. As will be noted later, vacuum filtration did not allow loading of TiO2 layer stable to scratching. Therefore, additional layer of TiO2 was loaded by CBD and the amount of TiO2 added was calculated from weighing results before and after CBD. During CBD, TiO2 layer is deposited by thermal hydrolysis of TiOSO4 + H2SO4 solutions over TiO2 seeds previously loaded by filtration. For efficient hydrogen production, it was important to optimize the quantity of TiO2 loaded by CBD. Fig. 4 shows how the concentration of titanyl sulfate influences the amount of titanium dioxide loaded during a constant deposition time. Addition of H2SO4 was important to decelerate the deposition of TiO2. Without sulfuric acid, deposition proceeds not only over TiO2 seeded in the membrane but also over the whole reaction vessel as we observed cloudy deposits on the vessel's walls. Fig. 4 shows that within the TiOSO4 concentration range from 0 to 2 mM, the increase in the mass of precipitated TiO2 is very small. Then, above the 2 mM TiOSO4 concentration, a proportional TiO2 mass increase with increasing concentration was observed. The character of the mass vs. concentration dependence can be explained by a classical nucleation theory [24]. The concentration from 0 to 2 mM is insufficient for the heterogeneous formation of TiO2 during the experiment because the curvature radius of the forming particles does not reach a critical value for heterogeneous nucleation over TiO2 in the membrane. At TiOSO4 concentration in excess of 2 mM, intensive precipitation starts and this may mean that the value of the radius exceeds the critical one. However, as the concentration increases further, the radius reaches a value for homogeneous nucleation in the bulk of the solution, and the homogeneous deposition start to compete with the heterogeneous one over TiO2 in the membrane. Membranes with different kinds of TiO2 loaded by different filtration methods were used for CBD. Membranes covered by filtration with TiO2 H–N gained less TiO2 in CBD than membranes with TiO2 DP25. For example, in the same experimental conditions (0.0042 M TiOSO4, 0.1 M H2SO4, T = 70 °C) CBD resulted in weight change of 3 and 5 mg for membranes preloaded by BUU method with 2 mg TiO2 H–N and DP25, respectively. Commercial TiO2 H–N is prepared by precipitation from titanyl sulfate while TiO2 DP25 is prepared by flame synthesis. The surface of the latter TiO2 is more stable to chemicals [25]. Possibly, TiO2 H–N consisting of smaller primary particles is partially dissolved during the CBD procedure, which results in smaller weight change compared to DP25. The second reason for smaller loading for H–N could be poorer access of CDB solution to TiO2 seeds in membranes since smaller particles can penetrate deeper into the membrane pores and smaller pores in TiO2 itself. This is indirectly confirmed by the fact that CBD over membrane preloaded with TiO2 H–N with TD filtration method resulted in larger loading of 3 mg. The possible partial dissolution of TiO2 H–N is supported by the fact that the CBD solution becomes turbid much earlier and stronger than the solution in an experiment with DP25 preloaded membrane. This means that a high concentration of TiO2 is achieved much earlier in the experiment with the H–N preloaded membrane. 3.1.2 Mechanical properties of membranes The MFFK-3 membranes used for all experiments consist of a small pore Teflon filtering layer with the declared characteristic penetration particle size of 450 nm and a reinforcing polypropylene fiber layer. Therefore, it has greater mechanical strength in contrast to membranes composed of pure PTFE. The filtering process and wetting with ethanol does not affect the mechanical properties of the membranes since they did not change their size and lamination was not observed. Soaking in certain organic solvents such as acetone and hexane, which partially dissolve the reinforcing layer and disrupt the binding strength of polypropylene with Teflon, reduces the membrane size, causes its deformation and losing of its original shape. The layer of Teflon is easily removed away from the layer of polypropylene fibers by pressing. Heating to above 100 °C also causes deformation of the membranes. Next, we consider the strength of the photocatalyst layer attached to the membrane. It is very important for the durability of the operating MPS. As a result of TiO2 loading by filtration we found that application of the BUU procedure provides a more durable layer of TiO2 than that of the TD procedure. A TiO2 particle redispersion in the reaction solution was not observed during hydrogen generation over membranes prepared by the BUU procedure but was observed for membranes prepared by the TD procedure. The different binding durability of photocatalysts in the membrane can be explained by several reasons. The first reason is that ultrasound crushes the TiO2 particles agglomerates on the membrane surface contributing to their further movement into the pores in the membrane. Thus, more dense packing and durability of binding of the particles is achieved. The second reason could be the difference in movement of suspension across the membrane. When the suspension moves upward in the BUU procedure, particles that are poorly attached can easily fall away under the force of gravity. When the suspension moves down in the TD procedure, even poorly attached particles stay in their place under the forces of gravity and viscous flow. Thus, less compact TiO2 particles structure is formed that is prone to suspending. The TiO2 layer formed during filtration is unstable towards scratching and touching. Deposition of the additional TiO2 layer by CBD resulted in strong fixing of photocatalyst which was resistant to abrasion. The CBD procedure provides binding of the TiO2 particles together and to the membrane due to the TiO2 layer grown over the preloaded seeds. The increase in mechanical strength of TiO2 layer was obtained in all series of CBD experiments. 3.1.3 Permeability of membranes The low level of MPS permeability is important to provide efficient separation of the products of oxidation and reduction that take place on the different sides of the membrane. The MFFK-3 membrane pores are plugged by loading a layer of TiO2 with limited thickness in order to ensure efficient electron transport across the layer. The research on the dye-sensitized solar cells demonstrated that the thickness of TiO2 deposited on an electrode should be limited to approximately 10–20 μm [26,27]. The thinnest layer can be obtained by loading TiO2 inside the membrane's pores near its surface. This is achieved by removing an excess of titanium dioxide from membrane surface by scrape with magnetic stir bar. The main method of loading the membranes was filtering by BUU procedure because TD and BU procedures give smaller leakage time (LT) and poor mechanical properties. Table 2 gives the results of membrane loading by this method. One can see that single step loading from single component suspension gives LT below 1 min. Scrape with stir bar always decreases LT to below 30 s due to partially removing the pore plugs. Two step coating allows obtaining small permeability and large LT of above 1000 s. The idea was to plug large pores in the first step with larger particles of DP25 and plug smaller ones in the second step with smaller particles of H–N. An increase in concentration of TiO2 DP25 suspension from 1 to 6 mg/L did not affect strongly the LT. On the contrary, increase in concentration of H–N led to a decrease of LT presumably because large agglomerates at higher concentration do not plug pores efficiently. Drying of membranes decreased LT for membranes without scrape but did not change it for membranes after scrape. Cracks are formed during drying and thus permeability increases. Application of two-component suspension in experiment 4 allowed obtaining somewhat larger LT equal to 108 s directly after the single step possibly because the different particles of DP25 and H–N plugged pores of different size. Applying even larger quantities of photocatalyst up to 20 mg did not increase LT above 100 s. Thus, the two-step deposition is a prerequisite for low permeability. As it was already mentioned, drying of the membranes increased their permeability strongly. Thus, storage of membrane in water instead of drying was tried. However, it was found that storage in water also leads to a strong decrease in the LT. Probably, the increase of the permeability is associated with relaxation of the membrane and cracking of the layer of TiO2 nanoparticles. It is also worth mentioning that comparison of membranes with a high LT was hampered by long time to reach steady LT results. So, membranes with a high LT were compared using the first two portions of water after wetting the membrane with alcohol. However, reproducibility was poor. To improve membrane reproducibility, mechanical properties and obtain low permeability, loading of TiO2 on membranes by CBD method was applied. Several membranes preloaded with TiO2 by filtration were used for loading TiO2 by CBD. It was found that CBD increases LT and membranes with initially higher LT give higher LT after CBD under the same conditions of application. The effect of the mass of CBD loaded TiO2 on membrane permeability is demonstrated in Fig. 5 . One can see that LT increases with the amount of TiO2 loaded. Unfortunately, drying of CBD loaded membranes led to a decrease in the LT. For example, drying of membranes with 4 mg TiO2 loaded by CBD produces a decrease in LT from about 120 s to 60 s. The chemically loaded membranes were further aged to improve their photocatalytic properties. Hydrothermal treatment is known to increase the crystallinity of TiO2 and improve its photocatalytic activity [28]. This aging did not change the membranes permeability. 3.1.4 Membrane diffuse reflection The values of membrane reflection taken in the UV part of spectrum where TiO2 absorbs all incident light, e.g. at 300 nm, provide information about coverage of membrane with TiO2-based photocatalyst. Since the spectra were taken using bare membrane as the 100% reflection reference, the coverage should be directly connected with reflection. Table 2 gives reflection for few membranes prepared by single and double filtration. Many more membranes were prepared and it was found that scrape with stir bar after TiO2 deposition with BUU filtration gives reflection at 300 nm from 15 to 25%. Thus, the effect of TiO2 concentration, amount of photocatalyst or number of successive loadings on reflection for scraped membranes is small. Correspondingly, the fraction of membrane surface coated with TiO2 layer of thickness high enough for complete absorption of UV light remains equal to 75–85%. This value of reflection should correspond to almost completely filled surface pores and the rest of the PTFE membrane surface is thought to be occupied by bridges between the pores. Experiment 1 in Table 2 demonstrates that loading 4 mg TiO2 without scrape decreases reflection of the membrane to about 6% and the corresponding fraction of the completely coated surface is about 94%. Loading 12 mg TiO2 without further scrape decreases reflection to about 4%. Therefore the increase in weight of TiO2 on the membrane has little influence on surface coverage with TiO2. This shows that further increase in the weight of TiO2 only leads to thickening of the photocatalyst layer on the membrane rather than to an increase in surface coverage. The reflection after Experiment 4 equals to about 40%. The value suggests that the use of joint suspension of DP25 and H–N provides very loosely clogged pores of the membrane. It is well known that small platinum particles absorb incident UV, visible and infrared light. The amount and state of platinum on the surface are connected with the shape of the UV–Vis reflection spectra. Fig. 6 demonstrates the spectra for membranes loaded with different amount of Pt nanoparticles. The parameters of the membranes are given in Table 3 . One can see that reflection of membranes decreases with an increase in the mass of photoloaded Pt in the near-infrared part of the spectra. Fig. 7 reveals the interdependence of the reflection and platinum content in membranes. There is a close to linear fall in the reflection with the rise of photodeposited Pt mass. Therefore, the platinum particles are mainly deposited in the surface layer of TiO2 which is accessible to most of incident near-infrared radiation. Scratch tests of the membranes with photodeposited Pt corroborated this hypothesis since no dark deposits were discovered in the deep layers of loaded TiO2. The correlation of the diffuse reflection of membranes spectra and amount of photodeposited Pt can be used for qualitative estimation of the mass of Pt in membranes. 3.1.5 Platinum content Two parameters were varied during platinum particles photodeposition on membranes - the initial concentration of H2PtCl6 and the time of photocatalytic deposition. The photodeposition conditions and the resulting membrane characteristics are listed in Table 3. The photodeposition was performed using MFFK-3 membranes preloaded with the same amount of TiO2 DP25 (12 mg). Both parameters affect the content of Pt deposited. The dependence of the mass of platinum on initial concentration of H2PtCl6 is plotted in Fig. 8 for 40 min photodeposition time. We see that the amount of Pt linearly increases with concentration of H2PtCl6 in the range of 0–130 μM. Further increase in the H2PtCl6 initial concentration did not increase the amount of platinum and it remained at approximately the same level and even some decrease is observed at concentration 260 μM. The linear increase at low initial concentration of H2PtCl6 is probably associated with an increase of the quantity of adsorbed molecules of H2PtCl6 on the TiO2 surface and the corresponding rise of photoreduction rate. At higher initial concentration of H2PtCl6, the quantity of H2PtCl6 at the TiO2 surface does not limit any more the rate of photoreduction and it is determined by the rate of generation of electrons at the surface. Previously the influence of the H2PtCl6 concentration on the photodeposition rate was studied in [29]. The rate was almost independent on the initial concentration of H2PtCl6 though the concentrations were larger. The effect of the H2PtCl6 concentration is explained by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model. Fig. 9 shows the dependence of the amount of photodeposited platinum on the time of irradiation at three different levels of H2PtCl6 initial concentration. The figure shows that for lower concentrations, there is an induction period during which a small amount of platinum is photodeposited. This induction period was observed previously [30]. Possibly this period is connected with formation of seed platinum particles on the surface of TiO2. The induction period time decreases with an increase in initial concentration of H2PtCl6. After the induction period, the amount of photodeposited Pt rises linearly with the irradiation time. Thus, one can conveniently vary the initial concentration of H2PtCl6 and the photodeposition time in order to obtain the needed loading with Pt on photocatalytic membranes. 3.1.6 Textural characteristics of membranes The morphology of clean membranes and membranes loaded with TiO2 was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 10 shows that the front side of the membrane consisting of the PTFE filtering layer is covered with a network of pores with the diameter from 0.2 to 3 μm. The pores have variable diameter and shape as they protrude through the membrane. Thus, the effective size of the particles retained by this membrane is maintained by the effective diameter of their pores. The reverse side of the membrane is formed by polypropylene fiber substrate, consisting of bonded fibers with the diameter of about 20 μm. Fig. 11 shows SEM micrographs of several membranes loaded with TiO2 DP25 by filtration and CBD. Fig. 11A shows a membrane loaded with TiO2 and treated by stir bar. The picture shows that large pores are clogged with photocatalyst but some small and medium size pores remain open. This is in agreement with diffuse reflectance data that about one quarter of the membrane surface remains uncovered with TiO2 after scrape. Fig. 11B shows the front side of the membrane loaded with 2 mg DP25 by filtration. One can see that the membrane is covered with a layer of TiO2 which still has pores for permeation of gases and liquids. After loading this membrane with TiO2 by CBD the pores became less pronounced as Fig. 11C demonstrates. Fig. 11D and E show a membrane loaded with a thicker layer of TiO2 P25. Fig. 11D reveals numerous cracks of up to 2 μm thickness. Fig. 11E demonstrates that these cracks became filled with titanium dioxide as a result of CBD. Therefore, SEM images demonstrate the positive effect of loading TiO2 by CBD procedure on the formation of compact layer of photocatalyst at the MFFK-3 membrane surface."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production 3.2.1 Products of ethanol dehydrogenation Among the large quantity of MPS prepared in this study, only MPS with good mechanical stability were tested in the reaction of hydrogen production from aqueous ethanol solution under inert atmosphere. A large set of products of this reaction has been detected by means of gas chromatography in the liquid and gas phase. The target products of ethanol photocatalytic decomposition in anaerobic conditions are hydrogen and carbon dioxide according to the following equation. CH 3 CH 2 OH + 3 H 2 O + 6 hν → Pt / TiO 2 6 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Six electrons should be theoretically transferred from ethanol molecule to three water molecules to drive this reaction and therefore six photons at a minimum participate in it. Strictly speaking, the above reaction cannot be called dehydrogenation of ethanol because hydrogen is extracted from both ethanol and water molecules. However, we call the reaction of photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous ethanol in anaerobic conditions dehydrogenation for bare simplicity reason. The real dehydrogenation proceeds with formation of methane and ethane along with H2 and CO2 in the gas phase. In the liquid phase, products of incomplete oxidation of ethanol were found such as acetic acid and acetaldehyde. Therefore, overall reaction can be summarized in the following scheme. CH 3 CH 2 OH + H 2 O → hv Pt / TiO 2 H 2 + CH 3 COOH + CH 3 CHO + CH 4 + C 2 H 6 + CO 2 The stoichiometric coefficients in this and the following scheme are not indicated because the ratio between different products depends on the experimental conditions. This course of reaction is confirmed by the authors of [31]. Methane and ethane can be formed by the photo-Kolbe reaction from acetic acid according to the following scheme. CH 3 COOH → hν Pt / TiO 2 CO 2 + C 2 H 6 + CH 4 In some experiments, the amount of ethane was as large as the amount of CO2 formed. Fig. 12 shows how the concentration of gas phase products changes with irradiation time in the IC and NC of the membrane reactor over two types of MPS. Fig. 12A shows that the amount of produced CO2 is less than that required by Kolbe reaction stoichiometry, i.e. amount of CH4 + double amount of C2H6. Apparently, other reactions of production of methane and ethane occur. In other experiments, the amount of methane was close to the amount of emitted CO2 (Fig. 12B). Table 4 demonstrates the relation between quantities of gas phase carbon containing products formed. One can see that the amount of methane and ethane exceeds photo-Kolbe reaction stoichiometry in many cases but in several cases, they are evolved in very small fraction. In experiments 1–4 with membranes loaded with Pt/TiO2 (1% SR), the amount of evolved ethane was close to the amount of CO2. In experiments with chemically deposited TiO2 under conditions of both compartments filled with aqueous solutions, very small amount of ethane was released compared to the main products CO2 and CH4. The ratio of amount of CO2 to CH4 was 1 for membranes with LT < 300 s and 1.5 for membranes with LT ≥ 300 s. When only IC was filled with reaction solution, the situation is quite different (Experiments 5–9). At low mass (m < 2 mg) of CBD TiO2, the fraction of CO2 in products is very high, and the fraction of ethane and methane is small. At higher mass (m > 2 mg) of CBD precipitated TiO2 the ratio of amount of CO2 to methane is about 2, while the production of ethane was not observed. The distribution of products with IC filled with liquid and NC empty can be explained by the fact that almost all the products come through the layer of photocatalyst containing platinum. In such experiments for MPS made with Pt/TiO2(1%,SR), hydrocarbons can be produced from CO2 and H2 during their contact with Pt particles while passing from IC into NC. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 during hydrogen production was suggested in [31]. In contrast to Pt/TiO2(1%,SR) loaded MPS, the membranes with photodeposited platinum contain only a surface Pt reach layer. Thus, the formed products did not have enough contact time for reduction because platinum was not distributed in the photocatalyst layer. The differences in the distribution of carbon-containing products in the experiments with filled IC + empty NC and with filled both compartments may be explained by the fact that the products have small permeability through the membrane if liquid phase fills both compartments. Hence, the products located inside the MPS between two “liquid walls” have the opportunity to take part in further reduction reactions, in contrast to the situation with one “liquid wall” when all products are free to go to the gas space of NC. 3.2.2 Influence of photocatalyst mass on hydrogen evolution rate Efficient utilization of incident light requires its complete absorption by the layer of photocatalyst in MPS. To find out how much TiO2 photocatalyst is necessary for total absorption of light, experiments were carried out with varying amount of Pt/TiO2(1%,SR). Kinetic curves of hydrogen concentration were measured for a series of membranes with different amount of photocatalyst deposited by BUU filtration. The initial rate of hydrogen formation as a function of the mass of the photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 13 . The experimental points were approximated by the function W = a ( 1 − e − bm ) The fit produced parameters a = 15.78 ± 6.12 and b = 0.055 ± 0.032. The measured velocities have a large scattering due to the low stability of photocatalyst application and possible hydrogen leakage from the reactor. However, using the large number of points we can conclude that the rate of hydrogen production increases with the mass of TiO2 till about 12–15 mg. Application of photocatalyst mass in large excess of 12 mg gives an unstable layer and very small increase in activity. Therefore, further experiments employed 12 mg of TiO2-based photocatalysts. The efficiency of catalyst utilization can be expressed as the rate of hydrogen formation per unit of photocatalyst mass. Fig. 13 shows that the efficiency has a maximum for MPS containing 3 mg of Pt/TiO2. Therefore, we can conclude that the first 3 mg of photocatalyst is most effective in production of hydrogen in the whole photocatalyst layer. 3.2.3 Influence of platinum content on the rate of hydrogen evolution Obtaining the highest rates of hydrogen production requires determining the optimal composition of the photocatalytic layer of MPS. To investigate the influence of platinum content on the activity of MPS, experiments were carried out with different amounts of photodeposited platinum at a fixed mass of titanium dioxide DP25 equal to 12 mg. The results are shown graphically in Fig. 14 . One can see that at low quantity of platinum, the increase in loading leads to a linear increase in activity. Thus, more active sites for hydrogen evolution result in higher rate of hydrogen evolution. After Pt loading reaches about 0.06 mg, further increase in Pt loading leads to only small growth in activity. The highest rate of H2 evolution was about 15 ml/h which corresponds to quantum efficiency of about 13% under UV light. Increase of the amount of platinum causes increased light absorption that reduces the flow of photons on the particles of TiO2 and decreases the reaction rate. Another reason for leveling of the rate vs. Pt amount dependence can be that high amounts of Pt increase the rate of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers [8]. Since Pt is an expensive material, minimal quantity should be used that provides acceptable activity. Thus, 0.06 mg loading was chosen for preparation of further MPS and studying their activity peculiarities. 3.2.4 Influence of the mass of CBD loaded TiO2 on hydrogen evolution CBD of TiO2 leads to a well stabilized photocatalyst layer on a membrane. However, it can change the activity of MPS for hydrogen evolution. In order to investigate the influence of this factor, MPS samples containing from 0.5 to 7 mg of CBD precipitated TiO2 were prepared. Before CBD, the membranes used in these experiments contained 2 mg TiO2 DP25 deposited by filtration BUU. After CBD and photocatalytic loading with platinum in the same conditions, they were tested in evolution of hydrogen from aqueous ethanol solution. For the hydrogen production experiments, IC was filled with aqueous ethanol and NC was filled with water. Hydrogen production rate and total amount of other products generated in both compartments of the membrane reactor are given in Table 5 . The results in this table show that different amount of H2 and carbon containing products are produced in the different reactor compartments for different CBD TiO2 contents. In general, the increase in mass of CBD precipitated TiO2 leads to a decrease of the rate of hydrogen evolution calculated as a sum of the rates in both reactor compartments. In order to characterize the separation of hydrogen and other gaseous products over the membrane, separation coefficients KH2, KC and Kcom were introduced. There is a significant scatter of the separation coefficients for different membranes listed. The general outlook is that the separation coefficients decrease with an increase in mass of CBD loaded TiO2. Thus, higher amount of gaseous products remains in the IC that is an expected outcome since the membrane permeability decreases. The first two membranes demonstrate that due to the high permeability of membranes and high mobility of hydrogen, it is accumulated predominantly in the NC. Interestingly, CO2 and organics are distributed about equally among the IC and NC. The MPS 102 showed anomalously high LT and high rate of hydrogen evolution. Other experiments with 3 mg TiO2 deposited by CBD showed LT equal to 120–150 s. Thus, flexibility of membranes again caused poor reproducibility. Membranes with 5 and 7 mg TiO2 demonstrated KH2 and KC below 1. Thus, the membrane with a decreased permeability prevents movement of products to NC. The fact that even for membranes with high LT, products stand out in NC can be due to poor wetting of the reverse side of the membranes by water. Apparently the membrane contains gas phase to which the products diffuse easier than they pass through a layer of fluid in the IC. Hence, we can suppose that if we take an ethanol solution of sufficient concentration for wetting of the reverse side of membranes with a high LT, products will be evolve mainly in the IC. Separation of the target reaction product hydrogen from other products over different sides of the MPS is characterized by Kcom. Kcom is KH2 divided by KC. The highest value of this coefficient was observed for MPS containing 3 mg of CBD loaded TiO2. Taking into account that this MPS also demonstrated the highest activity, this loading was chosen for preparation of further membranes. It was interesting to compare the kinetics of hydrogen production for the two configurations, with both IC and NC filled with liquids and with only IC filled with liquid as described in section 2.4. Aqueous ethanol solution was placed in the IC in the both configurations. Table 6 shows the results of this comparison. One can see that experiments with the second configuration provide a markedly higher rate of hydrogen formation. The increase in the rate varies between 1.6 and 3.3. Such an increase of the rate may be due to the facilitation of the hydrogen transport into the gas phase via membrane to the gas-filled NC. The residence time of hydrogen in the three-phase system: the reaction solution in IC side – solid Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst on the membrane - gas phase in NC side – is significantly lower compared to the liquid-filled NC configuration. Hydrogen produced can participate in CO2 hydrogenation reaction to a larger extent for the liquid-filled NC configuration leading to a lower H2 generation rate. Fig. 15 shows the dependence of the rate of hydrogen evolution on the mass of TiO2 deposited by CBD for the case of only IC filled with liquid phase. The graph reveals that increasing the mass of TiO2 loaded by CBD leads to a nearly linear decrease in the activity of the MPS. It implies that the activity of CBD loaded TiO2 is smaller than the activity of DP25 in hydrogen production. It is generally confirmed in both configurations of compartments filling, though the data scattering was much higher for the configuration with both compartments filled with liquid phase. The higher fraction of CBD loaded TiO2 in MPS results therefore in decrease in activity. Further efforts were devoted to improvement of the activity of the chemically loaded photocatalyst. 3.2.5 Influence of the aging time of CBD loaded TiO2 on hydrogen evolution Previous results demonstrated that hydrothermal aging is ineffective if performed in water but gives good results if performed in sulfuric acid solutions for moderate time. Thus, it was important to find optimal conditions of hydrothermal treatment for improving the low photocatalytic activity of MPS with chemically loaded TiO2. For these experiments, five membranes were prepared with 3 mg of CBD loaded TiO2. The membranes were subjected to heating in aqueous solution of 0.1 M sulfuric acid for different time and after washing were loaded with platinum by photodeposition. The prepared MPS were tested in hydrogen production when the reaction solution was only in the IC. Fig. 16 shows the rate of hydrogen evolution on MPS aged for different time. It is seen that even a short 0.5 h aging increases the activity of MPS sharply. Eight hours aging increased the activity by 1.8 times. The maximum achieved reaction rate after 8 h aging was about 5.1 ml/h. The maximum obtained quantum efficiency of hydrogen generation was 12%. Unfortunately after drying, aging and the photodeposition of platinum on the membranes, their LT did not increase and remained in the range from 60 to 80 s though before drying it was 120–150 s. For this reason we did not carry out experiments to determine the distribution of reaction products with both compartments filled with liquids."
9,Conclusions,"A method of preparation of a stable photoactive layer based on TiO2 over the porous polymer membrane MFFK-3 has been developed. The method consists of the following steps: filtration of suspension through the membrane, chemical bath deposition of TiO2, aging of TiO2 in solution of H2SO4, and photocatalytic deposition of platinum. Relationships were established between the conditions of preparation of the membranes (concentration of precursor, application method of TiO2) and their properties (mass of deposited TiO2, mechanical strength, reflection, permeability, and morphology). Ethanol dehydrogenation products produced under UV light irradiation of photocatalyst loaded membranes were identified. The influence of platinum amount, mass and composition of the applied layer of TiO2 and aging time on the rate of hydrogen evolution was determined. The maximum achieved quantum efficiency of hydrogen generation was about 13%. The major findings of this study are the following. 1. The filtration of TiO2 suspension through the membrane under ultrasound can provide low permeability of the membrane. 2. Mechanical stability of the photocatalyst layer on the membrane surface can be provided by chemical bath loading of an additional layer of TiO2. 3. Membranes with pores highly clogged by photocatalyst in produce higher amounts of gaseous products in the irradiated compartment of the membrane reactor. This gives hope for the achievable separation of the reaction products in the membrane system. 4. The rate of hydrogen production is higher in the liquid-membrane-gas configuration compared to the liquid-membrane-liquid configuration."
