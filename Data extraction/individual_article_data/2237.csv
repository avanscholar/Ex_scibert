0,Introduction,"The 2018 World Health Organization report indicates that alcohol abuse resulted in more than 3 million deaths, which represents 1 in 20 deaths and is more than 5% of the global disease burden [1]. Long-term alcohol abuse can specifically result in Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD), which includes fatty liver (steatosis), alcoholic hepatitis, and alcoholic cirrhosis. Alcohol is metabolized inside the intestine and liver hepatocytes by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and inducible cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), both of which catalyze the conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) inside the mitochondria then converts acetaldehyde to acetic acid [2,3]. Alcohol metabolism produces toxic metabolic intermediates and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play pivotal roles in cell and tissue damage. Apart from ALD, alcohol toxicity is also associated with several tissue-specific cancers, diabetes, modulation of immune response, pneumonia and healing defects following injury [4]. CYP enzymes belong to a multigene family of heme proteins, which metabolize various substances including lipids, toxic chemicals, xenobiotic compounds and play an important role in modulating the pharmaco-kinetics and pharmacogenetics of various pharmaceutical drugs [5,6]. CYP2E1 is a member of this family, which is induced to 5–15 fold following alcohol consumption and produces ROS due to its poor coupling with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase [7–11]. We have previously shown that CYP2E1 is bimodally targeted to both mitochondria and microsome [12,13] and that the mitochondrial CYP2E1 drives alcohol toxicity by increasing ROS within the mitochondria (mtROS), leading to the selective degradation of CcO subunits I, IVi1 and VB [13–15]. Studies from our laboratory and others have used different cell lines overexpressing human CYP2E1 to demonstrate the toxic effects of alcohol metabolism [13,16,17]. Although these studies provided valuable insight into the role of CYP2E1 in alcohol liver toxicity, they fail to recapitulate the inducible upregulation of CYP2E1 that occurs in hepatocytes in vivo following alcohol consumption. In the present study, we utilize HepaRG, a human hepatic cell line, that when grown at low density, expresses markers of hepatic bipotent progenitors, but after complete confluence and DMSO treatment, differentiate into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells [18,19]. Differentiated HepaRG cells retain activities of phase I, II, and III enzymes, and various nuclear receptors at levels more comparable to primary human hepatocytes than any other established hepatic cell lines [20]. Prior to differentiation, HepaRG cells express very low to undetectable levels of CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 mRNAs, but their expression increases dramatically after complete differentiation [18]. In vitro organoid models have been a major breakthrough for translational studies, as these near physiological 3D models more accurately represent in vivo biological processes like tissue renewal as well as tissue responsiveness to drugs, toxins, and mutagenesis [21]. Relative to conventional monolayer cultures, 3D liver spheroid/organoid cultures are better models for studying hepatic toxicity. Specifically, 3D cultures of HepaRG cells show increased production of albumin, urea and glucose, and also maintain higher levels of drug transporter (MRP2) expression and CYP activities compared to monolayer cultures [22–24]. In the present study, we used both monolayer and 3D cultures of HepaRG cells to determine the role of CYP2E1 in alcohol-induced hepatic damage. Alcohol treatment of differentiated HepaRG cells induced CYP2E1 expression, increased ROS production, impaired mitochondrial function, and induced mitophagy. Besides, we find that alcohol treatment of 3D organoid cultures increased superoxide levels, induced mitochondrial stress signaling and also markers of hepatic steatosis, demonstrating the usefulness of the 3D culture for accurately predicting alcohol toxicity in an ex vivo system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,HepaRG monolayer culture,"2.1 HepaRG monolayer culture HepaRG cells were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (HPRGC10), and maintained in a growth medium composed of Williams’ E medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no: 12551–032) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, cat. no: SH30070), 100 units/ml penicillin (GIBCO), 100 g/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma, cat. no: I05-16), 2 mM l-glutamine (GIBCO, cat. no: 25030), and 50 μM hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (Sigma, cat. no: H0888). After complete confluence, cells were treated with a culture medium supplemented with 1.7% DMSO (GIBCO) for two more weeks to obtain differentiated HepaRG cells."
3,HepaRG organoid cultures,"2.2 HepaRG organoid cultures Differentiated HepaRG cells were trypsinized, and suspended in Williams' E medium with GlutaMAX™ containing general-purpose additive (HEPARG750; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were seeded at a density of 3000 viable cells per well in a 96 well U-shaped bottom, Ultra Low Attachment (ULA) plates (Corning, cat. no: 4515). After 5 days, the medium was replaced and the organoids were maintained in William’ E medium supplemented with serum-free induction additive (HEPRG650, Thermo Fisher Scientific), with 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 ng/ml hepatocyte growth factor (Gibco by Life Technologies), and 0.5% DMSO [25]. Spheroids/organoids were grown in an AggreWell™800 plate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stemcell Technologies, cat. no: 34815). Briefly, plates were prepared by coating with Anti-Adherence rinsing solution (Stemcell Technologies, cat. no: 07010) for 2 h, centrifugation at 1300×g for 5 min, aspirating rinsing solution and washing with culture medium. Differentiated HepaRG cells (9 × 105/well, which corresponds to 300 organoids, with each organoid containing approximately 3000 cells) were plated in a 24 well plate and centrifuged at 100×g for 3 min to uniformly distribute cells at the bottom of wells. Medium was changed every three days and organoid culture conditions were followed as mentioned for ULA-plates. HepaRG monolayer or organoid cultures were treated with 100 mM ethanol for up to 72 h. To avoid evaporation of alcohol, plates were wrapped with Parafilm."
4,Light and fluorescence microscopy,"2.3 Light and fluorescence microscopy Phase contrast images were captured using a Nikon Cool Pix S10VR (Nikon, Japan) fitted to the microscope eyepiece. Organoid sizes were measured using Image J. Mitochondrial mass was analyzed by staining cells or organoids with 100 nM MitoTracker Green™ (Invitrogen, cat. no: M7514) and mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed by incubating organoids with 150 nM MitoTracker Orange™ (Invitrogen, cat. no: M7511) for 1 h. Live organoid imaging was carried out using a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal microscope at 20× magnification. Fluorescence intensity of organoids was calculated using Image-J and expressed as corrected total organoid fluorescence (CTOF). CTOF was calculated by subtracting integrated density value with area of selected organoid multiplied by mean fluorescence of background readings. For live and dead cell imaging, organoids were stained with Calcein-AM (Abcam, cat. no: ab141420) (25 μM final concentration) and propidium iodide (10 μg/ml), and live images were captured using a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal microscope. For organoid ROS imaging, we used the ROS-ID Total ROS/Superoxide Detection kit from Enzo Lifesciences (ENZ-51010) as per manufacturers’ instructions. The kit includes two fluorescent dyes, the Oxidative Stress Detection Reagent (Green) for total ROS/RNS detection and the Superoxide Detection Reagent (Orange). Oxidative Stress Detection Reagent is cell-permeable non fluorescent ROS detection dye reacts directly with a wide range of reactive species, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxynitrite (ONOO‾), hydroxyl radicals (HO), nitric oxide (NO), and peroxy radical (ROO), yielding a green fluorescent product and has low affinity for superoxide. Briefly, organoids were treated with cell-permeable ROS detection dyes provided in the kit (2 μM) and Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) (Sigma, cat. no: B2261) for 1 h and images were captured using spinning disk confocal microscope."
5,Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence,2.4 Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence Organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. Organoid sectioning and H&E analysis were carried out at UPENN histology core. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 μm thick sections using antibodies to Parkin and DRP1. F-actin was visualized using Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin. Confocal fluorescence imaging was performed using a Leica Sp5 FLIM microscope at 40 × magnification.
6,RNA isolation and RT-qPCR,"2.5 RNA isolation and RT-qPCR Total RNA was extracted from approximately 300 organoids using TRIzoL™ (Invitrogen cat. no: 15596018) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, cat. no: 18080044). RT-qPCR analysis was performed with a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System using an SYBR Green mix (Applied Biosystems, cat. no: 4309155). Primers used in the study are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using 2−ΔΔCt method using GAPDH as reference gene."
7,Metabolomics analysis,"2.6 Metabolomics analysis Alcohol treated and untreated organoids were collected in a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube, washed with ice-cold PBS, and snap frozen using liquid nitrogen. Frozen organoids were homogenized in 300 μL acetonitrile/0.3% formic acid in the Precellys Homogenizer. The resulting homogenate was aliquoted for the assay of organic acids, amino acids and acylcarnitines using Agilent 1290 HPLC/6495 triple quadrupole MS. The raw data was normalized from μM to pmol/300 organoids (UPENN metabolomics core at Perelman School of Medicine)."
8,Isolation of mitochondria,"2.7 Isolation of mitochondria Mitochondria from differentiated HepaRG cells were isolated as described previously [26]. Briefly, cells were homogenized with a Dounce glass homogenizer in H-medium (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA–containing 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain) and the homogenate was centrifuged two times at 145×g for 10 min to pellet nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant from this step was centrifuged at 9200×g for 20 min to pellet the mitochondrial fraction. The pellet was reconstituted in H-medium and pelleted through a 0.8 M sucrose layer to minimize microsomal contamination. Protein concentration was determined by Lowry's method."
9,Seahorse platform measurements,"2.8 Seahorse platform measurements Simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of HepaRG 3D organoids was performed using a Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XF) Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Culture plates (24 well) were coated with growth factor reduced matrigel matrix (1:10 dilution) (Corning, cat. no: 35420) and 150–200 organoids were plated per well after the completion of the experimental period. We measured OCR and ECAR before and after the sequential injection of different inhibitors, oligomycin (4 μg/ml), FCCP (1 μM) and rotenone (1 μM). After completion of the assay, readings for each well was normalized by total protein content, as assayed using Lowry's method."
10,Assay of electron transport chain complexes,"2.9 Assay of electron transport chain complexes Assays for mitochondrial complex I and CcO were carried out as described by Birch-Machin and Turnbull [27] using a Cary 1E UV–Vis Spectrophotometer. Briefly, complex I activity (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) was measured by incubating 20 μg of mitochondria in 1 ml of assay buffer containing 25 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM NaCN, 2.5 mg/ml BSA, 130 μM NADH, 65 μM ubiquinone and 2 μg/ml antimycin A, and measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm to monitor NADH oxidation. CcO activity was measured by incubating 10 μg of mitochondria in 25 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.45 mM dodecyl maltoside and 15 mM reduced cytochrome c and following the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm to measure cytochrome c oxidation."
11,ROS analysis using HPLC and amplex red methods,"2.10 ROS analysis using HPLC and amplex red methods After treatment, organoids were treated with 20 μM hydroethidine (HE) for 1 h in a fresh medium. Cells were washed with ice cold PBS, pelleted into 1.5 ml tubes, and centrifuged at 2500×g for 2 min. The cell pellets were snap frozen using liquid nitrogen. The products of HE oxidation were extracted with 200 μL of acetonitrile per pellet and profiled and quantitated by HPLC using the authentic standards for 2-OH-E+, E+ and E+-E+, as previously described [28]. 2-OH-E+ was used as a marker for superoxide radical anion. The values provided represent the concentration of the probe and products in the cell extract. Amplex UltraRed™ is a fluorogenic substrate for horseradish peroxidase (HRP) that reacts with H2O2 to produce a fluorescent resorufin derivative, with excitation and emission maxima at 568 and 581 nm, respectively. Differentiated HepaRG cells were plated on 96–well plates, and after alcohol treatment, cells were treated with Amplex UltraRed™ (50 μM), HRP (0.2 U) and incubated for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C. The resulting fluorescence was measured using 50 μL of cell suspension in a Chameleon plate reader (Hidex, Finland) at 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission."
12,Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential,"2.11 Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured by staining cell with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, 1 × 106 live cells were washed with PBS at room temperature and resuspended in phenol red-free medium without FBS and stained with 100 nM TMRE and incubated in the dark for 10 min at 37 °C. As a positive control, cells were treated with Carbonyl Cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). Fluorescence intensity of TMRE stained cells were measured using Cellometer Vision CBA (Nexcelom Biosciences, Lawrence, MA) by setting the filter at 595 nm emission and excitation at 530 nm."
13,Nile Red and oil O red staining,"2.12 Nile Red and oil O red staining The Nile Red lipid stain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. no: sc-203747) used for assaying total lipids in organoids using a fluorescence confocal microscope. Organoids were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution (Affymatrix, cat. no: AAJ19943K2) at room temperature for 1 h and washed three times with PBS. Washed organoids were incubated with 2 μM Nile Red stain in PBS together with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) overnight in the dark at room temperature. Before imaging, organoids were again washed three times with PBS. Imaging was carried out using a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal microscope at 20× magnification. Oil O Red staining of organoid sections were performed by UPENN histopathology core."
14,"Quantitation of NAD, NADH levels and ADH, ALDH2 activity assays","2.13 Quantitation of NAD, NADH levels and ADH, ALDH2 activity assays Differentiated HepaRG cells in monolayer cultures were treated with 100 mM ethanol for 72 h and cell lysates were prepared according to manufacturer's recommendation for ADH, ALDH2 and NAD, NADH quantification assays. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was measured using the standard kit (Sigma, cat. no: MAK053). ADH activity measured using ethanol and NAD+ as the substrates, and the resulting colorimetric product is proportional to the amount of NADH formed, and thus to enzymatic activity. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) activity (Abcam, cat. no: ab115348) measured according to the manufacturer's protocol. ALDH2 activity is measured using acetaldehyde, NAD+ as substrates, and the NADH produced determines its activity. NAD+ and NADH were extracted and quantified from cell lysates using a specific kit (Abcam, cat. no: ab65348) following the manufacturer's instructions. The levels of total NAD (both NAD+ and NADH) and NADH are measured using colorimetric readings at 450 nm, and the level of NAD+ calculated by subtracting NADH from total NAD."
15,Statistical analysis,"2.14 Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in biological triplicates. Statistical significance was calculated by Student's t-test for comparing two groups (Microsoft Excel). Multiple comparisons were done using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test. (Graph Pad PRISM program, La Jolla California, USA). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant (*p-value<0.05, **p-value<0.01, **p-value<0.001). Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation or standard error of mean."
16,Results,
17,Alcohol-induced CYP2E1 expression and ROS production in differentiated HepaRG cells,"3.1 Alcohol-induced CYP2E1 expression and ROS production in differentiated HepaRG cells In the present study, we used HepaRG cells, a human hepatoma cell line that when differentiated to hepatocytes, closely resemble primary human hepatocytes [18,19]. Only after differentiation into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, we observed positive PAS staining (indicative of glycogen storage), increased albumin expression, and nuclear localization of HNF-4α in HepaRG cells (Fig. 1 A and B, Sup. Fig. 1A). Furthermore, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels were induced >100 fold after differentiation (Fig. 1B). Initial time course experiments indicated a further increase in CYP2E1 mRNA by alcohol treatment for up to 48 h and a subsequent reduction at 72 h; however, we observed a time dependent increase in CYP2E1 protein levels (Fig. 1C and D). Total cellular H2O2 was measured using the Amplex UltraRed™ assay, which showed a significant increase in probe oxidation, as measured by fluorescence intensity, after alcohol treatment (Fig. 1E). Further, diallyl sulfide (DAS), an inhibitor of CYP2E1 partially decreased fluorescence levels, supporting a role for CYP2E1 in H2O2 production (Fig. 1E). The specificity of fluorescence signal was tested by the addition of membrane permeable catalase (PEG-catalase) which reduced the fluorescence signal (Fig. 1E). Although, DAS treatment significantly reduced AmplexRed fluorescence, it was less effective compared to membrane permeable catalase and may require higher concentrations to completely inhibit H2O2 production. These results indicate that differentiated HepaRG cells express major hepatocyte markers including CYP2E1, and that alcohol treatment further increased CYP2E1 levels and H2O2 production."
18,Alcohol increased mitochondrial CYP2E1 levels and induced mitophagy,"3.2 Alcohol increased mitochondrial CYP2E1 levels and induced mitophagy We and others have shown that, in addition to its established location in the ER, CYP2E1 localizes to mitochondria where it plays an important role in cellular toxicity [9,13,16,29]. We assessed levels of CYP2E1 in mitochondria isolated from control and alcohol treated HepaRG cells. Western blot analysis showed a 1.5-fold increase of CYP2E1 protein levels in mitochondria from alcohol treated cells (Fig. 2 A). Immunofluorescence analysis further confirmed mitochondrial colocalization with mitochondrial marker ATP5B (Sup. Fig. 1B). As reported before, alcohol treatment reduced the levels of CcO subunits IVi1 and Vb (Fig. 2A) and also activity (Fig. 2B). Results also show that complex I activity was not affected by alcohol treatment. (Fig. 2B). Treatment with the CYP2E1 inhibitor diallyl sulfide (DAS) partially prevented alcohol-induced loss of CcO activity (Fig. 2B). Using live cell imaging of cells stained with MitoTracker™ Green, we observed a decrease in total mitochondrial mass after alcohol treatment (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, decrease in MitoTraker™ Green fluorescence intensity observed exclusively in differentiated hepatocyte colonies but not in surrounding cholongiocytes, indicating CYP2E1 induction and associated alcohol metabolism takes place inside the hepatocytes. Similarly, alcohol treatment significantly decreased membrane potential (ΔΨm), and treatment with DAS (diallyl sulfide) partially prevented the loss of membrane potential (Fig. 2D). Since we observed increased ROS (H2O2), compromised CcO activity and decreased ΔΨm, we analyzed mitochondrial turnover by assessing mitophagy markers LC3-B, Parkin, and mitochondrial fission marker, DRP1 using immunofluorescence and Western blot methods. We observed that alcohol treatment of HepaRG cells induced Parkin, DRP1, and LC3-B levels, all indicative of increased fission and mitophagy (Fig. 2E and Sup. Fig. 1C & Sup. Fig. 2A). Further, we analyzed mitophagy flux by treating cells with chloroquine and observed increased flux after alcohol treatment (Sup. Fig. 2B). Besides, immunofluorescence analysis of alcohol treated HepaRG cells show that DRP1, and Parkin are explicitly increased in hepatocytes, not in the surrounding cholangiocytes (Sup. Fig. 1C & Sup. Fig. 2A). Similarly, increased accumulation of autophagosomes as evidenced by increase LC3B staining was seen only in hepatocytes (Sup. Fig. 2C). Phalloidin staining was introduced in chloroquine experiments to clearly visualize individual cells and appreciate LC3B specific increase in hepatocytes. These results indicate that alcohol treatment increased CYP2E1 in hepatocytes and affected mitochondrial mass and increased mitophagy flux. Alcohol treatment also increased mRNA levels of IGF1-R, TGF-β, and TNF-α (Fig. 2F), indicative of a stress response. These genes were previously shown to be mitochondrial stress-responsive genes [30–32]. These results indicate that the treatment of differentiated HepaRG cells with alcohol increased mitochondrial CYP2E1 levels, loss of mitochondrial mass, decreased ΔΨm and reduced CcO activity and all these changes associated with alcohol metabolism were restricted to hepatocytes."
19,3D organoid cultures of differentiated HepaRG cells,"3.3 3D organoid cultures of differentiated HepaRG cells Induced differentiation of HepaRG cells in monolayer cultures results in the generation of hepatocytes that are phenotypically similar to primary human hepatocytes and cells that resemble biliary epithelial cells. However, several studies indicate that culturing differentiated HepaRG cells in 3D organoids enhances hepatocyte differentiation and maturation with increased albumin secretion [33] and induces the expression of CYP 2E1 and 3A4 enzymes [22,34]. As 3D organoid cultures are thought to more closely recapitulate organs in vivo [35], we reasoned that they may be more useful for studies on alcohol liver toxicity. We tested three different methods for generating 3D organoid cultures: (1) a Matrigel encapsulated format in which cells are cultured inside a matrigel matrix (with or without FBS), (2) a 96 well U-shaped ultralow attachment (ULA) plate format, and (3) an AggreWell™800 plate format. Although we tried different combinations of cell density and culture media conditions, differentiated HepaRG cells failed to form organoids inside matrigel scaffolds (Sup. Fig. 3A and B). However, when differentiated HepaRG cells (3000 cells per well) were plated in U-shaped ULA plates or 9 × 105 cells per well in 24 well of an AggreWell™800 plate (which corresponds to approximately 3000 cells per organoid), these cells started forming compact organoids starting from day 5 (Fig. 3 A & Sup. Fig. 3C). We did not see a notable difference in organoid size throughout the culturing (Fig. 3B). H&E staining indicates that 14- and 17-day organoids have a compact structure with a clear outer border (Fig. 3D). We observed a time-dependent increase in albumin, HNF-4α and CYP3A4 mRNA levels (Fig. 3C) and immunofluorescence analysis showed abundant albumin expression and nuclear localization of HNF-4α, indicative of functional hepatocytes throughout the organoid (Fig. 3E). H&E analysis indicate no notable difference between ULA and Aggrewell culture methods (Sup. Fig. 3D). We adopted the AggreWell™ 800 plate method for further analysis because of the higher number of organoids per well, allowing for more uniform alcohol treatment."
20,Alcohol-induced CYP2E1 expression and mitochondrial stress in 3D hepatic organoids,"3.4 Alcohol-induced CYP2E1 expression and mitochondrial stress in 3D hepatic organoids Similar to HepaRG cells in monolayer cultures, 3D organoid cultures of HepaRG cells upregulate CYP2E1 expression in a time dependent fashion in response to alcohol (100 mM) treatment for 48 h and 72 h, but at levels higher than the 2D cultures (Fig. 3F). Immunofluorescence analysis (IFC) of HepaRG organoids indicates a significant increase in CYP2E1 protein after alcohol treatment for 72 h (Fig. 3G). H&E staining shows that alcohol treatment affected organoid integrity (Fig. 4 A). Live-dead cell imaging by calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) staining, indicated that alcohol treatment induced cell death inside the organoid (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescence staining of control and alcohol treated organoid sections with phalloidin shows disrupted F-actin cytoskeletal distribution and integrity in alcohol treated organoids (Fig. 4C). ROS from control organoids or organoids treated with alcohol alone or a combination of alcohol and membrane permeable superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) were analyzed to quantify O2 •–-specific product of HE oxidation, 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-E+) using HPLC method. Alcohol treatment significantly increased 2-OH-E+ and E+-E+ products (Fig. 4D). SOD treatment decreased the level of the oxidation products (both 2-OH-E+ and E+-E+) to the control level. Probe uptake was also increased after alcohol treatment, but after normalization to intracellular HE level, there is a small, but statistically significant increase in 2-OH-E+/HE ratio, and SOD brings the ratio back to the control level (Fig. 4D). Also, E+-E+/HE ratio increased in ethanol treated group (data not presented). Alcohol treatment resulted in increased formation of superoxide in 3D cell culture. Increased formation of E+-E+ may also implicate the involvement of other, one-electron oxidizing species. We also measured total ROS from control and alcohol treated organoids using a live cell imaging method by staining with ROS-ID, a total ROS detection Kit (Enzo Life Sciences). The reagents in this kit (whose identity is not disclosed) responds to different cellular oxidants with an increase in green fluorescence intensity. Alcohol treatments increased the fluorescence intensity of organoids, consistent with increased oxidant production (Sup. Fig. 4A). Treatment with membrane permeable catalase decreased fluorescence intensity of alcohol treated cells, indicating that H2O2 may be involved in the mechanism. However, NAC (5 mM) treatment was less effective in reducing fluorescence intensity, possibly because of concentration effects or permeability. Live cell imaging of organoids using MitoTracker™ Green or MitoTracker™ Orange indicates both mitochondrial mass and transmembrane potential are significantly decreased (Fig. 4E). As observed in monolayer culture, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IFC) analysis on control and alcohol treated organoid sections showed increased levels of Parkin, DRP1, and LC3-B, indicative of active mitophagy (Sup. Fig. 4B and C). Thus, alcohol treatment of 3D hepatic organoids induces CYP2E1, affects organoid ultrastructure, and increases ROS production, resulting in reduced mitochondrial mass, membrane potential and activated mitophagy."
21,"Alcohol treatment of hepatic organoids alters metabolism, activates mitochondrial retrograde signaling and induces steatosis","3.5 Alcohol treatment of hepatic organoids alters metabolism, activates mitochondrial retrograde signaling and induces steatosis Seahorse XF24-based extracellular flux analysis of hepatic organoids indicated that alcohol treatment decreased overall respiration and increased extracellular acidification rates (Fig. 4F). The respiratory parameters indicate that alcohol treatment significantly decreased basal respiration and maximal respiration and moderately affected proton leak, ATP linked respiration and spare respiratory capacity (Sup. Fig. 3E). These differential effects seen in derived parameters maybe due to slow uptake of inhibitors by hepatic organoids during the assay. Metabolomic analysis indicated altered TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism in 3D organoids treated with alcohol (Sup. Fig. 4D and E). Mitochondrial retrograde signaling (MtRS) is a pathophysiological response of mitochondria under stress that affects the nuclear gene expression profile [36,37]. In the case of Ca2+/calcineurin mediated MtRS, we showed that nearly 120 genes involved in different aspects of cell metabolism, proliferation, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms were induced [36,37]. These genes were induced in response to mtDNA loss, defects in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex proteins, all of which cause loss of ΔΨm [32,38]. Disruption ΔΨm and impaired mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ causes a higher leakage of ER calcium due to overexpression of RYR1 channels (Roy Chowdhury et al., 2020, in press) resulting in activation of a cytosolic protein phosphatase, calcineurin and downstream activation of a number of genes [30,31,39]. Next, we assessed the expression of genes known to be upregulated in different mitochondrial stress models, that we consider as marker genes of MtRS [39]. Notably, mRNA levels of these marker genes, including RYR1, TGF-β, Cn-α, GLUT4, IGF1-R, and HNRNPA2/B1 are increased by different levels in 3D organoids following alcohol treatment (Fig. 5 A), as are TNF-α mRNA levels. Interestingly, RYR1 and Cn-α are not induced in monolayer culture following alcohol treatment (data not presented), further supporting differential signaling in 2D vs. 3D cultures. Finally, immunofluorescence analysis of control and alcohol treated hepatic organoid sections indicated increased levels and nuclear localization of retrograde transcription factors C/EBPδ and HNRNPA2/B1 (Fig. 5B). Chronic alcohol consumption promotes hepatic steatosis, an early marker of hepatic damage, proceeds to fibrosis and cirrhosis in ALD patients. Altered hepatic lipid metabolism, mainly due to compromised beta oxidation and increased lipogenesis leads to hepatic lipid accumulation causes steatosis [40,41]. The physiological relevance of HepaRG organoids was further substantiated by the alcohol-induced increase in Oil O Red staining on organoid sections and Nile Red staining of organoids, both indicative of lipid accumulation, which is a marker of early steatosis (Fig. 5C). Further, a number of metabolic genes that play important roles in steatosis such as SREBP1, PPARγ, FASN, and ACC1 are upregulated (Fig. 5D). Alcohol treatment also increased total triglyceride levels inside the hepatic organoids (Fig. 5E). Metabolomic analysis indicates that alcohol treatment significantly increased levels of C3 and C4 acylcarnitines inside the organoids (Fig. 5F). MYCN (n-Myc) is a Myc family of helix-loop-helix-zipper transcription factor and highly induced in hepatocellular carcinomas, specifically in a subpopulation of cancer stem cells, and plays an essential role in cancer progression [42]. Interestingly, alcohol treatment increased mRNA levels of n-Myc (Sup. Fig. 4F) (an early marker of hepatic stem cells) and also increased its nuclear localization (Fig. 5G) [42]. Together, these results indicate that mitochondrial stress induced by alcohol treatment of HepaRG organoids activates retrograde signaling, affects overall metabolism, and induces steatosis."
22,CYP2E1 knockdown in HepaRG cells alleviates alcohol-induced MtRS and steatosis in organoids,"3.6 CYP2E1 knockdown in HepaRG cells alleviates alcohol-induced MtRS and steatosis in organoids To understand the role of CYP2E1 in alcohol-induced hepatic damage, we used three different shRNAs directed against the translated region of CYP2E1 mRNA and cloned them into the pLKO.1 vector. We transfected these shRNA constructs into COS-7 cells overexpressing human CYP2E1 and observed that shRNA2 was most effective in knocking down the mRNA levels (Sup. Fig. 5A). We generated stable cell lines expressing either pLKO.1shGFP (shGFP ctrl) or pLKO.1 2E1-sh2 (2E1 KD) (Fig. 6 A). We treated shGFP ctrl and 2E1 KD cells both in monolayer and 3D organoid cultures with alcohol and observed that alcohol treatment did not increase CYP2E1 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 6B and C and Sup. Fig. 5B) in 2E1 KD cells. Alcohol treatment caused a moderate effect on ADH and ALDH2 enzyme activities both in shGFP control and 2E1 KD HepaRG cells (Sup. Fig. 5C). The NAD+/NADH ratio significantly decreased in shGFP control cells after alcohol treatments, whereas in 2E1 KD cells, alcohol treatments significantly increased NAD+/NADH ratio (Fig. 6E). As shown in Fig. 6D, the organoid morphology was not affected in 2E1 KD cells, as evidenced by H&E or immunofluorescence staining (Sup. Fig. 5D). Notably, CYP2E1 knockdown in HepaRG organoids prevented the alcohol-induced increase in expression of retrograde signaling marker genes GLUT4, Cn-α and RYR1 and also significantly affected the increase of TGF-β, IGF1-R and TNF-α mRNA levels (Fig. 6F). Importantly, alcohol treatment of 2E1 KD organoids failed to show increased Nile Red staining (Fig. 7 A). We also observed a marked induction of hepatic steatosis genes, namely, SREBP1, PPARγ, FASN and ACC1 that were induced by alcohol treatment but markedly reduced in CYP2E1 mRNA knocked down organoids (Fig. 7 B1 and B2). Finally, alcohol induced n-Myc mRNA and protein expression which was significantly alleviated by CYP2E1 mRNA knock down (Fig. 7C and D). Although, n-MYC protein in 2E1 KD organoids after alcohol treatment is moderately increased but is not statistically significant (Fig. 7D). Alcohol treatment induced the expression of mitochondrial fission protein DRP1, both in monolayer and organoid cultures, indicating increased mitochondrial fission. Recent studies show that mitochondrial dynamics plays an essential role in metabolism and associated stress signaling (reviewed in ref. 43). We further investigated the possible connection between mitochondrial dynamics and MtRS by treating 3D organoids with either Mdivi-1 (DRP1 inhibitor) or FK506 (a calcineurin inhibitor) 24 h after commencement of alcohol treatment. Results of quantitative PCR presented in Fig. 8 A show that almost all of the MtRS markers tested, including TNF-α, IGF1-R, RYR1, hNRNPA2/B1, and Cathepsin-L were significantly reduced by both Mdivi-1 and FK506 treatment at different levels. These results support the previously suggested link between mitochondrial dynamics and MtRS [43]. Notably, alcohol-induced expression of hepatic steatosis markers, PPARγ, FASN, and ACC1 was also impacted by both inhibitors (Fig. 8B), suggesting that alcohol-induced steatosis may also be modulated by mitochondrial dynamics and MtRS. These results indicate a direct role of CYP2E1 in alcohol-induced mitochondrial retrograde signaling in HepaRG 3D organoids. Further, Mdivi-1 and FK506 treatments implicated MtRS signaling proteins as possible molecular targets for ALD pathologies."
23,Discussion,"Alcohol toxicity is considered to be a major cause of liver disease in many parts of the world. Although alcohol toxicity is multifactorial, the metabolism of alcohol by alcohol dehydrogenase and/or CYP2E1 is the initial step in the conversion of alcohol to toxic acetaldehyde. CYP2E1 mediated alcohol metabolism produces elevated levels of ROS and play a major role in cell and tissue damage. Several studies have shown that alcohol toxicity is associated with multiple signaling cascades and epigenetic control of gene expression that contribute to alcohol liver disease (ALD) [44–46]. Previous studies from our and other labs showed that mitochondria-targeted CYP2E1 induces alcohol toxicity by causing CcO disruption, mtDNA depletion and affecting respiration in treated cells. In this study, we have used the human HepaRG hepatic 3D organoid culture, which closely mimics the hepatic tissue, to show that alcohol induces CYP2E1 dependent disruption of ΔΨm and mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling (MtRS), resulting in altered nuclear gene expression program that leads to hepatic steatosis. Although originated from the liver tumor [18], undifferentiated HepaRG cells represent an ideal model to study alcohol toxicity since they can be fully differentiated into functional hepatocytes [20] and used for developing 3D organoids. The 3D organoids of epithelial cells from the intestine, esophagus, pancreas, and other tissues have provided excellent near in vivo models for various metabolic and genetic studies. Here we show that 3D organoids of differentiated HepaRG cells respond to alcohol treatment in a manner that recapitulates the pathophysiological conditions observed in human ALD and alcohol treated rodents. First, under both 2D and 3D culture conditions, alcohol treatment induces the expression of CYP2E1, similar to what is observed in vivo in the liver. Second, alcohol treatment induces autophagy markers (PARKIN, DRP1, and LC3-B), similar to what was shown in hepatic tissue of alcohol fed rats [47,48]. Third and most interestingly, alcohol treatment induces markers of hepatic steatosis, which is an early indication for ALD. Thus, the response of 3D organoids of HepaRG cells largely recapitulates the in vivo hepatic system and represents a valuable model in which to asses alcohol toxicity. Our metabolomic and functional extracellular flux analyses of alcohol treated hepatic organoids showed marginally higher citrate levels, with compromised oxygen consumption rates (OCR), increased extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) and induced expression of GLUT4 mRNA levels, suggesting glycolysis as the main source of ATP production. Besides, reduced OXPHOS complex CcO activity and decreased ATP-linked respiration also support that alcohol treated HepaRG cells depends on alternate pathways of ATP production and we do not exclude other possibilities for increased ECAR. It is noteworthy that GLUT4 is classical MtRS response gene based on transcription analysis of promoter elements in a number of cell lines including C2C12 myoblasts, A549 lung carcinoma cells, HCT116 colon carcinoma, RAW macrophages and murine esophageal cells [39,49–51]. Induction of GLUT4 gene expression in response to alcohol treatment is consistent with our previous results. Further, alcohol treatment significantly decreased NAD+/NADH ratio and increased mRNA levels for TNF-α, FASN, ACC1, and SREBP1, important genes upregulated during fatty acid biosynthesis. These alcohol mediated metabolic and gene expression changes suggest that fatty acid synthesis will supersede its degradation by β-oxidation, an indication for hepatic steatosis [40]. Besides metabolic changes, reports indicate alcohol treatments inhibit Rab7 activity, resulting in the impaired fusion of the lipid droplets with the autophagic machinery, resulting in hepatic lipid accumulation and steatosis [52]. Further studies are required to understand the role of these pathways of hepatic steatosis in these hepatic organoids. In our study, alcohol treatment significantly increased the accumulation of short chain acylcarnitines (C3 and C4) in hepatic organoids. These results are consistent with those of Fuller and Hoppel, who found that alcoholics with liver disease have significantly higher levels of plasma short-chain acylcarnitines compared to control and alcoholics without any liver disease [53]. Similarly, patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis have higher short-chain acylcarnitine levels [54]. Even defined nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients show a specific increase in short-chain acylcarnitines (C3, C4, and C5) [55]. Our results, therefore, show that alcohol treated 3D organoids closely recapitulate the human ALD disease phenotype. In previous studies, we showed that CYP2E1 was bimodally targeted to mitochondria and that mitochondrial localization was enhanced by PKA mediated phosphorylation of Thr at position 128 of the nascent chain (12). Notably, the mitochondrial CYP2E1 mass in human liver samples ranged from 1% to nearly 60% of the total tissue mass [12–14]. Mitochondria targeted CYP2E1 specifically induces alcohol mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in vitro in transduced cells [13,15]. We observed that alcohol treatment of differentiated HepaRG cells significantly reduced NAD+/NADH ratio, possibly reflecting CYP2E1 mediated alcohol metabolism in cells. Furthermore, alcohol treatment did not show increase in ADH and ALDH2 activities in HepaRG cells, whereas CYP2E1 KD HepaRG cells showed significantly higher NAD+/NADH ratio, with marginally higher ADH and ALDH2 enzyme activities. CYP2E1 is significantly increased in binge alcohol treated BL6 mice, but alcohol treatment failed to increase ADH and ALDH2 protein levels [56]. Similarly, alcohol treatments of isolated rat primary hepatocytes show reduced NAD+/NADH ratio [57]. We believe rapid induction of CYP2E1 by alcohol treatment has different cellular metabolic and toxic effects compared to metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase. Our results also showed that differentiated HepaRG cells in monolayer treated with alcohol showed markedly reduced CcO IVi1 and Vb subunits, reduced CcO activity, and disruption of ΔΨm. Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis of differentiated HepaRG cells in monolayer cultures also indicated cell type differences of alcohol toxicity between hepatocytes and cholongiocytes. Alcohol treatment of 3D organoids showed increased superoxide levels, reduced respiratory parameters, modulated metabolism, and induced mitochondrial retrograde signaling (MtRS). These alcohol-mediated effects were ameliorated in organoids with shRNA-mediated CYP2E1 mRNA knockdown. These in vitro studies indicate the important role of hepatic CYP2E1 induction in alcohol liver toxicity and for the first time suggest a role in metabolic shift. Furthermore, Mdivi-1, a potent and specific inhibitor of mitochondrial fission, also alleviated alcohol-induced expression of markers of hepatic steatosis, suggesting a major role for mitochondrial dysfunction in alcohol-induced toxicity. Studies show that higher concentrations of Mdivi-1 (50–100 μM) is deleterious to cells and showed that it affects mitochondrial complex-1 activity, respiration and produces higher ROS [58]. In the present study, we used suboptimal concentrations (10 μM) of Mdivi-1. At similar concentration, Mdivi-1 inhibited DRP1 in MPV−/− esophageal cell organoids as shown in our previous study [51]. The dose dependence of Mdivi-1 effects is controversial and we cannot exclude any other side effects of Mdivi-l. More importantly, alcohol treatment of 3D organoids induced mitochondrial retrograde signaling (MtRS), a nuclear response to mitochondrial DNA/membrane damage designed to cope with altered metabolism and pro-apoptotic signals. We showed in multiple cell lines (C2C12, macrophages, A549, MCF7, MCF11A, HCT116, and primary esophageal cells (from MPV17 −/− mouse model of mtDNA depletion) that decreased membrane potential due to mtDNA depletion or CCCP treatment or defects in OXPOS complex proteins (CcO), induce MtRS. Activated Calcineurin in turn activates a number of downstream calcium dependent transcription factors (NFAT, CEBP, ATF, and CREB) which form enhanciosome complex with HNRNPA2/B1 and alters gene expression of different genes. We observed consistent pattern in number of genes up-regulated in various cellular and mouse models, and we believe up-regulation of these genes shapes metabolism and make cells adapt to stress conditions [30–32,49,51,59,60]. Specifically, we observed the induction of IGF1-R, TGF-β, Cn-α, RYR1, GLUT-4 and cathepsin-L mRNAs and nuclear localization of CEBPδ, HNRNPA2/B1, all markers of MtRS. In support of a previous study from our laboratory [43], present results with 3D hepatic organoids suggested a possible connection between mitochondrial fission and activation of MtRS since both Mdivi-1, and FK506 inhibited alcohol-induced toxicity, retrograde signaling and induction of hepatic steatosis markers. Together, these data identify a novel connecting link between CYP2E1 function, MtRS, alcohol-induced toxicity and steatosis in an in vivo-mimic 3D organoids. These data also shed light on several new therapeutic targets for treating alcohol toxicity and possibly reversing ALD."
