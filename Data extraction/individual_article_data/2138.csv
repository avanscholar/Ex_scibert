0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2), a clean and high energy carrying resource is considered to be an efficient energy alternative for the future, which can be fed into the fuel cell systems for efficient conversion of chemical energy to electricity (Rosenbaum et al., 2005). Microalgal systems are emerging as promising H2 producers of the future (Benemann, 2000), which show direct involvement of nitrogenase and hydrogenase enzymes. To deal with the oxygen sensitivity of these enzymes, indirect biophotolysis involving separation of H2 and O2 evolving reactions into separate stages, coupled through CO2 fixation has been explored (Song et al., 2011). Efforts are underway to increase H2 production by manipulating various physico-chemical conditions including composition of buffer or nutrient medium and entrapment of the cells in different matrices (Burgess et al., 2004; Davila-Vazuez et al., 2011; Kaushik and Anjana, 2011). Besides aiming to increase hydrogen production, it was proposed by Benemann (2000) that efforts should be made to integrate H2 production by the microalgae with wastewater treatment to reduce overall cost. Very little work has been done on this aspect and we have come across one preliminary batch study by Shah et al. (2001) using a marine species for H2 production and dye removal. A recent study reports H2 production by Clostridium in toxic wastewater (Ho and Lee, 2011). This is the first lab-scale study reporting possible integration of continuous hydrogen production by a fresh water cyanobacterium in photobioreactors and biosorption of some toxic and carcinogenic dyes and metals from simulated textile wastewater in continuous system. Keeping into consideration the need of the small scale textile units to have economically and environmentally sustainable treatment techniques, the aim was to explore a system integrating energy production and upgradation of the wastewater. This industry contributing largely to the national economy, is however, decentralized as small scale cottage industry in most of the developing countries. Several synthetic dyes, heavy metals and other chemicals are used by textile and dyeing industries, many of which reach the waste stream (Jacob and Azariah, 2000). Reactive dyes with azo-based chromophores combined with different reactive groups are much in use in textile industry (Aksu and Tezer, 2005) and azo dyes are known to release toxic amines due to reactive cleavage of azo groups (Joshi et al., 2004). However, one of the recent findings indicates that aromatic amines could also slightly stimulate the biodecolorizer Aeromonas hydrophila in the presence of azo dyes (Chen et al., 2009). Many triphenyl methane dyes, also used extensively in textile dyeing, are also hazardous due to their carcinogenic nature. Reactive red 198 (RR 198) dye and Crystal violet (CV) dye, a triphenyl methane dye widely used by textile mills were selected for bioremoval in this study. Besides dyes, textile wastewaters also contain several heavy metals that are constituents of metallized dyes or are used as binding agents. Cr(VI) and Co(II) selected in the present study, exist in the textile wastewaters causing several adverse impacts on aquatic systems and human health. While use of low cost adsorbents for biosorption of dyes and heavy metals has been widely studied and reviewed (Crini and Badot, 2008), there has been increasing interest on exploring various microbial systems for wastewater treatment, considering the environmentally safe, toxic sludge-less process in contrast to the conventional methods (Forgacs et al., 2004). We have used, an indigenous strain of cyanobacterium isolated from contaminated textile mills sites, suited to the sub-tropical climatic conditions, for the dual purpose of hydrogen production and biosorption of some toxic dyes and heavy metals present in textile wastewaters. Since metals and dyes coexist in the textile wastewaters, and their co-existence change the biosorption pattern (Sadettin and Donmez, 2007), we have used simulated textile wastewater in the present study. After exploring the hydrogen production and biosorption potential of several native cyanobacteria and green algae (Anjana et al., 2010; Mona et al., 2011a), we selected Nostoc linckia HA-46, a promising strain for the study. H2 photo production by the cyanobacterium was investigated in photobioreactor (PBRs) both in free (PBRFr) and immobilized (PBRImm) forms. Immobilization matrices being natural, non-toxic and cheap are not only suitable for industrial use (Karube et al., 1986), but also the enzyme system and pH inside the matrix are more stable (Kosourov and Seibert, 2009). Prevention of clump formation and filament breakage add to its merits. Spent biomass from PBRFr was dried and immobilized prior to its use as a biosorbent, while that from PBRImm was used as such. Since biosorption could be metabolism dependent or independent based on the fact whether the cells are live or dead/dormant, hence it was hypothesized that overall functioning of the two types of integrated systems using different forms of biomass would vary."
1,Methods,
2,Cyanobacterial strain and growth conditions,"2.1 Cyanobacterial strain and growth conditions Nostoc linckia HA 46 strain isolated from a textile mill oxidation pond was selected as a model system. Identification and culturing details of the organism are described in our earlier report (Mona et al., 2011a). The cells were harvested in late logarithmic phase (7d) by centrifugation at 1200g for 15min and used for hydrogen production studies in free or immobilized forms."
3,Immobilization of Nostoc for hydrogen production,"2.2 Immobilization of Nostoc for hydrogen production Nostoc linckia (7d stage) were immobilized by entrapment method using different matrices. A dense 7-mL cell suspension (containing 0.1g dry wt. of the cyanobacterium) was re-suspended in double distilled water and mixed thoroughly followed by immobilization. Entrapment of Nostoc in alginate gel was done using sodium alginate as described elsewhere (Kiran and Kaushik, 2008). Immobilization in carrageenan gel was done following the procedure described by Karube et al. (1986) and in agarose gel following Aksu (1998). Entrapment of Nostoc biomass in Poly vinyl alcohol alginate (PVA–A) gel and Polyvinyl alcohol alginate cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (PVA–A–G) gel was done following the methods described by Bagai and Madamwar (1998). The cyanobacterium immobilized in various matrices was in the form of small beads (3±0.1mm) and the rates of hydrogen production were expressed in nmol/h/mg dry wt. for batch studies."
4,Hydrogen assay and hydrogenase activity,"2.3 Hydrogen assay and hydrogenase activity H2 production experiments in batch mode for the immobilized N. linckia beads were performed in triplicates in sealed vials (15-mL) under conditions of continuous stirring (100rpm). Immobilized cyanobacterial beads entrapped in different matrices were incubated for hydrogen production and hydrogenase activity with BG-11 medium (2mL cyanobacterial beads+1mL culture medium). All the air in the vial was replaced with argon to provide anaerobic conditions. Hydrogen assay was carried out at 18h light (3000l×)/6h dark, 31°C temperature and pH 8.0, based on our earlier study (Mona et al., 2011a). Hydrogen production by the immobilized Nostoc cells was estimated after 24, 48, and 72h of incubation. In vitro hydrogenase activity of the immobilized cyanobacterium was estimated following the method of Kosourov et al. (2002) using methyl viologen that was reduced by sodium dithionite in dark anaerobic conditions and the rates of H2 production were estimated on a calibrated gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a 13× molecular sieve column, thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using nitrogen as the carrier gas as described in our earlier paper (Mona et al., 2011a). Hydrogen production rates were expressed in nmol/h/mg dry wt."
5,Optimization of cell dose in alginate immobilized beads,"2.4 Optimization of cell dose in alginate immobilized beads After obtaining results on hydrogenase and hydrogen production in different immobilization matrices, alginate was found to be most efficient and hence used for further studies. Effect of cyanobacterial dose (0.1–2.5g) in the immobilized beads on H2 production was studied during 24, 48, and 72h of incubation."
6,Photobioreactor (PBR) studies for hydrogen production,"2.5 Photobioreactor (PBR) studies for hydrogen production Photobioreactors (1-L) made up of borosilicate glass with a working volume of 0.9L were used for continuous hydrogen production at 31°C. The reactors contained either free or immobilized biomass of N. linckia, referred to as PBRFr and PBRImm, respectively. Alginate immobilized Nostoc (1.1g), in the form of beads, filled 0.6L of the reactor (PBRImm) while the rest was occupied by BG-11 medium. In PBRFr 0.6L of concentrated 7d culture of Nostoc (containing 8.5g dry wt.; 5.1μgChl a/mL) was suspended in 0.3L of BG-11 medium. The reactors were stirred intermittently. Argon was sparged in the beginning (for 10min) to replace all the air in the reactors. Illumination (3000l×) was done from three sides with white fluorescent light and a light/dark cycle of 18/6h was maintained. Each bioreactor was connected to a vessel containing 50% KOH solution for absorbing CO2 produced by the cyanobacterium in the gas phase. The CO2 free hydrogen was further passed through a vessel (fitted with septum) containing NaCl and a few drops of HCl to absorb any moisture or alkaline vapors (Pandey and Pandey, 2008). After every 24h gas sample was withdrawn through a gas tight syringe from the head space of the vessel to analyze the concentration of H2 produced. Additional glucose (20mM) was added after 5d and a mixture of CO2 +Ar (02:10 v/v) were sparged for making the environment anaerobic at 10d when the rates of hydrogen production started declining. Different concentrations of exogenous glucose added to the culture were earlier tried in batch mode and 20mM concentration gave the best results for hydrogen production (detailed results not included here). Previously, we studied the effect of different combination of inert gases on rate of hydrogen production by N. linckia and CO2 +Ar (02:10 v/v) was found to be most suitable (Mona et al., 2011a) and was therefore used in the present photobioreactor studies. Changes in chlorophyll a of the cyanobacterial beads for immobilized system and that of the cyanobacterial culture for free system were studied every 24h by estimating the pigment concentration spectrophotometrically by hot extraction method using methanol at 60°C. Hydrogen production rates were expressed in μmol/h/mg Chl a for the PBR studies. In case of immobilized cells it was not possible to determine dry wt. of the cyanobacterium at each sampling day, hence hydrogen production was expressed per unit of the chlorophyll a as μmolH2/h/mg Chl a in both the photobioreactor studies. The experiments were terminated after 15days, when rates of H2 production declined by about one third the initial rates. The spent biomass after 15days of hydrogen production was used for biosorption of metals and dyes from simulated textile effluent."
7,Biosorption experiments with spent biomass,"2.6 Biosorption experiments with spent biomass 2.6.1 Preparation of simulated textile effluent Trade effluent was collected from three textile mills of Northern India and quantitatively analyzed for important parameters. Based on their characteristics, simulated wastewater was prepared with the following characteristics and composition: pH 8.0, electrical conductivity 5.0dSm−1, total dissolved solids 1500mg/L, total hardness 500mg/L (as CaCO3), chloride 1500mg/L, phosphate 2.0mg/L, Cr(VI) 5.0mg/L, Co(II) 2.5mg/L and Crystal Violet+Reactive Red dye (100mg/L) in 1:1 ratio. Chromium, cobalt, RR 198 dye and CV dye were the major content in textile wastewaters of Northern India, hence selected for simulated wastewater. The simulated effluent was used for the continuous mode biosorption studies. 2.6.2 Column studies for biosorption Spent biomass from PBRFr was immobilized in alginate matrix for biosorption studies, while the immobilized spent biomass from PBRImm was used as such. Biosorption of two heavy metals (chromium and cobalt) and dyes (Crystal Violet+Reactive Red) from the simulated textile effluent was studied using glass column (2.5cm i.d.) provided with glass wool at the bottom and glass beads at top (2cm layer) to allow a uniform inlet flow to the column. A known quantity of the biosorbent was placed in the column to obtain 25cm bed height, while flow rate of the simulated textile effluent was maintained at 3mL/min (already optimized). Samples at the outflow were collected at regular time intervals and analyzed for the dye and metal concentrations. The operation was carried out in down flow mode using peristaltic pumps. All the experiments were conducted at ambient temperature (28±3°C). With the movement of adsorbate, adsorption zone also starts moving and after some time the effluent concentration starts rising, known as breakthrough point. The time required to reach a specific break through concentration is referred as breakthrough time (t b). In the present study breakthrough time has been taken as the time up to which 100% removal of initial concentration of the two dyes and metals from simulated wastewater was achieved. The filtrate was analyzed for residual metals Cr(VI), Co(II) using atomic absorption (Shimadzu AA 6300) and dyes (RR 198+CV) using UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 531nm (λ max for the mixture of dyes). Breakthrough capacity of the column was calculated for dye/metal adsorption as follows: (1) Break through capacity ( mg / g ) = break through time × Flow rate × Initial dye / metal conc . Mass of adsorbent in the bed The flow of wastewater through the immobilized beads from PBRImm was hampered after one cycle while the spent biomass from PBRFr immobilized before biosorption could be used for three adsorption–desorption cycles using 0.1N HCl as a desorbing agent (flow rate 5mL/min). Regeneration efficiency of the beads (PBRFr) was calculated as follows: (2) Regeneration efficiency,RE ( % ) = q reg / q org × 100 where q reg is the adsorptive capacity of the regenerated column and q org is the original capacity (mg/g) of adsorbent."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of immobilization on Hydrogenase activity and hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of immobilization on Hydrogenase activity and hydrogen production Hydrogenase activity was influenced by the type of the immobilization matrix in which the cyanobacterium was entrapped (Table 1 ). It was the highest in alginate matrix (2116.8nmol/h/mg dry wt.) followed by that in PVA–A–G (966.5nmol/h/mg dry wt.), agarose (862.4nmol/h/mg dry wt.) and PVA–alginate (802.7nmol/h/mg dry wt.), while it was minimum in carrageenan gel (444.4nmol/h/mg dry wt.). Hydrogen production rates were closely related to the hydrogenase activity of the cyanobacterium in different immobilization matrices. Hydrogenase has been found to be the major enzyme responsible for H2 production in the present cyanobacterium (Mona et al., 2011a). The rates of production were maximum at 24h and gradually declined over the passage of time till 72h. At 24h, the rate of production by Nostoc cells was the highest (41.3nmol/h/mg dry wt.) in alginate immobilized beads, followed by that in PVA–A–G (39.2nmol/h/mg dry wt.). Rates of hydrogen production by Nostoc cells were found minimum in carrageenan beads (30.8nmol/h/mg dry wt.). Hydrogen production by N. linckia in batch mode is much higher than that reported (1.0–35.0nmolH2/h/mg dry wt.) for many other cyanobacterial strains, including species of Nostoc, Anabaena, Cylindrospermum, Scytonema, Aulosira, Oscillatoria and Spirulina (Kumar and Kumar, 1992). Kosourov and Seibert (2009) also observed that alginate entrapped cells of Chlamydomonas could produce H2 even in the presence of air, though the final H2 yields were lower than that in argon atmosphere. Since, hydrogenase activity and hydrogen production by N. linckia were maximum when immobilized in alginate matrix, and it was therefore, used in further studies."
10,Optimization of cell dose for enhanced hydrogen production in alginate beads,"3.2 Optimization of cell dose for enhanced hydrogen production in alginate beads In our earlier study various physico-chemical conditions for higher rates of hydrogen production were optimized (Mona et al., 2011a), which have been used in the present study. The effect of cell concentration, an important variable of the bound cell system was studied here. H2 production efficiency of the immobilized system as a function of cell density, with the inoculum size varying from 0.1 to 2.5g is shown in Fig. 1 . An inoculum of 1.1g was most favorable producing 50.1nmol of H2/h/mg dry wt. using alginate beads. A decline in hydrogen production observed beyond the inoculum concentration of 1.3g may be due to the fact that higher inoculum results in cell density high enough to decrease mechanical stability, leading to increased porosity allowing easier diffusion of O2 into the matrix. Oxygen diffusion is known to inhibit O2 sensitive hydrogenase enzyme, thus decreasing hydrogen production (Kosourov and Seibert, 2009). Photoproduction of hydrogen in the bioreactors was carried out using 18h light alternating with 6h dark period thus allowing the photo-produced carbohydrates to undergo fermentation evolving hydrogen during the dark period. Fast consumption of fermentation products from the medium by high density cells lead to high hydrogen yield (Ho and Lee, 2011). In the present system photosynthesis and hydrogen production by dark fermentation have been temporally separated thereby addressing the above problem."
11,Hydrogen production in photobioreactors using immobilized or free cyanobacterium,"3.3 Hydrogen production in photobioreactors using immobilized or free cyanobacterium Alginate bound cells of Nostoc were used in the photobioreactor, PBRImm. Under the optimized conditions of light, temperature, pH and anaerobic conditions described earlier, the cyanobacterium produced H2 at a rate of 154–171μmol/h/mg Chl a for 3days (Fig. 2 ), but thereafter, the rate of production declined to 116μmol/h/mg Chl-a at 5th day. The indigenous strain of Nostoc used in this study showed distinctly higher hydrogen production rates as compared to that by Nostoc flagilleforme and Anabaena variabilis (84.2 and 4.2μmol/h/mg Chl-a, respectively) reported by Lichtl et al. (1997) indicating better utility of the present strain. Rates of H2 production in PBRFr, the photobioreactor containing free cells of N. linckia increased from 68μmol/h/mg chl a at 1st day to 101.2μmol/h/mg chl a at 2nd day and gradually declined to 65.3μmol/h/mg Chl a at 5th day. This seemed to be due to depletion of the endogenous carbohydrates. At this stage, therefore, a glucose supplement (20mM) was given exogenously which resulted in recovery of hydrogen production (141 in PBRImm and 93.7μmol/h/mg Chl-a in PBRFr on 6th day). It is known that certain microalgal species can utilize reduced organic compounds via heterotrophic metabolism (Rashid et al., 2009). Since the level of hydrogen production by the microalgae with CO2 as sole source of carbon may be low, exogenous carbon sources can be helpful in increasing hydrogen production (Rashid et al., 2009). Hydrogenase-dependent H2 evolution in cyanobacteria is reported to be supported in the dark by endogenous substrates (Ho and Lee, 2011). Addition of exogenous carbohydrate substrate acts as an intermediary metabolite that may be assimilated by respiration as source of carbon and electrons for H2 production (Won and Lau, 2011). In a related study, addition of glucose to the medium increased total volume of hydrogen produced by the algae, but as the glucose was consumed, hydrogen production declined soon (Rashid et al., 2009). In the present study also the production rates could not be sustained very long at the same level and gradually declined to 115.6μmol/h/mg chl-a in PBRImm and 78.3μmol/h/mg chl-a in PBRFr by 10th day (Fig. 2), when sparging with anoxic gas-mixture of Ar+CO2 was done. Alternate light and dark conditions provided to the photobioreactors permitted photosynthesis by the cyanobacterium during the light period. During light period, cyanobacterial photosynthesis produces oxygen that could be one of the reasons for inhibiting oxygen sensitive hydrogenase leading to reduced hydrogen production. In the present study, we could not measure the levels of dissolved oxygen, though that could have helped in better interpretation of our observations. However, when we used a mixture of the anaerobic gases, CO2 +Ar (2:10, v/v), for sparging the photobioreactor at 10th d stage, there was a sharp increase in H2 production (232.8μmol/h/mg Chl-a in PBRImm and 179.7μmol/h/mg Chl-a in PBRFr) on 11th day. The anaerobic condition created by the sparging of these gases, on one hand, seems to facilitate the activity of hydrogenase enzyme, and on the other hand, the CO2 in the headspace could be helpful for the cells, serving as a raw material for photosynthetic production of carbohydrates. The use of CO2 as anaerobic gas for increasing and sustaining hydrogen production in the photobioreactor is of particular interest, since it suggests a way of utilizing the major greenhouse gas involved in global climate change. Production of H2, however declined to 148μmol/h/mg Chl-a in PBRImm and 106.3μmol/h/mg Chl-a in PBRFr by 15th day, when the experiments were terminated and the spent biomass was used for biosorption studies. Hydrogen production by immobilized cyanobacterium was much higher than that by the free cells throughout the 15d study. Average rate of hydrogen production over 15d incubation by immobilized Nostoc was 151μmol/h/mg Chl-a in PBRImm whereas it was 101.5μmol/h/mg Chl-a by free cells in PBRFr. Cell immobilization has been reported to provide protection to enzymes (hydrogenase) mediating metabolic activities against environmental disturbances, thus resulting in higher production rates and enabling the cells to be used for longer duration (Rashid et al., 2011). Besides this, immobilization effectively separates the cells from the liquid phase, significantly increases the cell density and as a consequence, allows for more efficient light utilization on a per unit area basis (Kosourov and Seibert, 2009). Effect of immobilization on facilitated hydrogen production has been reported mostly in unicellular microalgae (Laurinavichene et al., 2008), with fewer reports on cyanobacteria (Dickson et al., 2009). Hydrogen production with the alternating light/dark cycle was helpful in allowing generation of hydrogen without hydrogenase inactivation by N. linckia. Immobilized cells in alginate seemed effective in accomplishing condition changes between photosynthesis and hydrogen production, utilizing both endogenous carbohydrate storage (up to 5th day) and externally added glucose, under anaerobic conditions. A similar behavior by immobilized cyanobacterium Microcystis aeroginosa, in a two-stage hydrogen production process under S-deprived conditions has been reported by Rashid et al. (2009)."
12,Continuous mode biosorption studies using spent biomass in packed bed column,"3.4 Continuous mode biosorption studies using spent biomass in packed bed column Packed bed column of the spent biomass from PBRImm (taken as such) and PBRFr (after drying and immobilizing in alginate) were used for biosorption of two metals (chromium and cobalt) and dyes (Reactive Red 198+Crystal Violet) from simulated textile wastewater. Packed bed column is simple to operate, has high efficiency and permits cyclic sorption and desorption by making use of concentration difference, which allows more efficient utilization of the sorbent capacity and can be easily scaled up (Aksu and Cagatay, 2006). Removal of the sorbates were studied in columns with bed height of 25cm, flow rate of 3mL/min as a function of time for 17.5h the authors have earlier optimized biosorption parameters for removal of the dyes (Mona et al., 2011b,c) and metals (Mona et al., 2011d,e) using statistical models and reported biosorption kinetics and adsorption capacity of the biosorbent. Although the optimum pH for maximum removal of the two dyes and the metals were found in our earlier batch studies to be 2.0 for Cr and RR 198 dye, 3.5 for Co, and 8.0 for CV, in the present column studies, biosorption was carried out at pH 8.0, the actual pH of the trade effluent. This was done to explore the efficiency of our biosorbent in treating the textile wastewater at its existing pH. Variations in the removal of dyes and metals by the spent biomass of PBRImm (taken as such) are shown in Fig. 3 and that by the dried and freshly immobilized spent biomass from PBRFr (3 sorption/desorption cycles) as a function of time are shown in Fig. 4 a–c. Effluent and influent concentrations of the metals and dyes in the wastewater gradually became equal with passage of time in the biosorption column. The time taken for this was achieved much earlier for the metals (10.5 and 15h) as compared to the dyes (17.5h) when spent biomass from PBRImm was the biosorbent (Fig. 3). Similar trend was observed when spent biomass from PBRFr was used as the biosorbent for three successive sorption–desorption cycles (Fig. 4a–c). The breakthrough time decreased sharply in the second and third cycles. For the C out/C in ratio to be 1.0, the time taken was maximum for the dyes (31–33.5h), followed by chromium (25–25.8h) and was minimum for cobalt (22–23.7h) in the three sorption–desorption cycles as evident from Fig. 4 and Table 2 . Adsorption capacity of the column (from PBRImm) for 100% breakthrough concentrations was found to be 1.75mg/g for the mixture of the two dyes at an initial concentration of 100mg/L, while it was 0.23 and 0.18mg/g for Cr(VI) and Co(II), at initial concentrations of 5.0 and 2.5mg/L, respectively (Table 2). The exhaustion time of the bed was found to be influenced by the initial concentrations of the dye mixture and metal ions. The exhaustion time was maximum (17.5h) for the mixture of dyes which had highest initial concentration among the sorbates. Breakthrough time also seemed to be concentration dependent and was maximum in case of cobalt (28min) that had lowest initial concentration. However, this biosorbent could be used for a single cycle only and after that flow of the wastewater was hampered due to compaction of the column bed. This seemed to be due to partial loss of mechanical integrity of the beads after 15d incubation in the hydrogen producing photobioreactor with intermittent stirring. The biosorption parameters for the spent biomass from PBRFr (immobilized in alginate just before use as a biosorbent) are also included in Table 2. Adsorption capacity of the column in the first cycle was found to be 15, 1.0 and 1.41mg/g for the dye mixture, and the two metals (Cr and Co), respectively. The breakthrough time and bed exhaustion time were more in case of the freshly immobilized spent biomass from PBRFr as compared to the spent biomass used as such from PBRImm. In the three sequential cycles it was observed that breakthrough time declined and bed exhaustion time increased. A similar trend was observed earlier while using the fresh immobilized biomass of Lyngbya putealis for removal of a metal (Kiran and Kaushik, 2008). The breakthrough curves approached the ideal sigmoid shape and the steepness of the curves indicated that the biosorbent used is more efficient for removal of two heavy metals, Co and Cr, which are present in quite low concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0mg/L, respectively as compared to the mixture of the dyes that are of a higher concentration of 50+50mg/L in the effluent. Using a biosorbent in wastewater treatment is not only important from the point of view of its biosorption capacity, but, also how well the biomass could be regenerated and reused. For examining the possibility of repeated use of the biosorbent, the dye and metal ions were desorbed. About 90–96% of the adsorbed dyes and the metals could be desorbed from the biosorbent. The regeneration efficiencies (RE) calculated for the three cycles of sorption–desorption are also included in the Table 2. RE was about 45% for the two metals and 37% for the dye mixture after the second cycle, which declined to 7 and 20% in the third cycle. It was also observed that breakthrough time and uptake capacity at breakpoints decreased and exhaustion time increased with each successive cycle. This may be due to some possible adverse effect of the desorbing agent on the binding sites of the biosorbent. The dye/metal uptake by the biosorbent in successive cycles is reported to be dependent on the desorption process, as prolonged desorption can destroy the binding sites or inadequate time for desorption might allow the dye/metal to remain onto the biosorbent (Kiran and Kaushik, 2008). The bed length also decreased in each successive cycle, indicating dissolution of some soluble constituents during desorption. Shortening of breakthrough time in second and third cycle reveals gradual loss of biosorption performance of the column. Since the breakthrough capacity decreased significantly after the third cycle, it was not tried for further applications. On comparing the output of the two types of the PBRs and biosorption columns utilizing the spent biomass, we find that although hydrogen production rates are relatively better in PBRImm with immobilized cyanobacterium, but at the end of 15d of PBR operation, the spent biomass is not very efficient as a biosorbent to be used in continuous column, as evident from our results on bed exhaustion time and adsorption capacity. It is therefore proposed to use free biomass of the cyanobacterium in PBR for biohydrogen production for 15d and then the waste biomass is collected, so that up to three cycles of sorption–desorption could be run efficiently. The dual application of the cyanobacterium for continuous hydrogen production and removal of some pollutants from textile wastewater as an integrated lab-scale system is depicted schematically (Fig. 5 ). Sufficient biomass of N. linckia is produced in the illuminated growth chamber (A), which is used at late logarithmic phase of growth (7d) for hydrogen production in the bioreactor (B) fitted on three sides with fluorescent lights (L) and gently stirred on magnetic stirrer (MS). The bioreactor (B) is attached to two vessels B1 and B2 containing an alkali solution for absorption of any CO2 produced and NaCl+few drops of HCl for absorbing any moisture or traces of alkali vapors. Hydrogen collected in the headspace of the vessel B2 is quantitatively estimated at regular intervals. The spent biomass is transferred to immobilization unit (C) and immobilized cyanobacterial biomass (CB) constitutes the biosorption column (D) through which the wastewater (influent) flows through a peristaltic pump (PP) at a constant rate. Residual concentration of the metals/dyes is quantified in the effluent and the biosorbent is regenerated after each cycle by passing a suitable eluent through the column at a constant rate."
13,Conclusion,"It is possible to integrate hydrogen production in photobioreactor with a packed bed biosorption column on lab-scale for removal of certain pollutants. Sustained and enhanced hydrogen production at average rates of 101μmol/h/mg Chl a for 15d was achieved by glucose supplement and anoxic gas sparging using free cyanobacterial biomass. The spent biomass from the photobioreactor dried and immobilized prior to its use as a biosorbent effectively removed some toxic metals and dyes in three adsorption–desorption cycles. Further, multiple sets of the PBRs coupled to biosorption reactors need to be carried out before scale-up of the system."
