0,Introduction,"Fuel cells are one of promising candidates for generating clean energy. Fuel cells utilize hydrogen or hydrogen rich gas as fuel. In order to make the fuel cell technology more available and widespread, it is essential to develop reliable technologies which ensure a steady supply of hydrogen as fuel. Therefore, there have been intensive research activities aiming for producing hydrogen through the processing of hydrogen rich fuels. For example, hydrocarbons [1–6], alcohols [7–9], and biomass have been studied as hydrogen source. Dimethyl ether (DME) has been also recognized as a potential hydrogen source for power generation. DME has many advantages as a hydrogen source such as high hydrogen to carbon ratio, non-toxic and non-corrosive nature, high energy density, no carbon–carbon bond, low reforming temperature (200–400°C), and similar physical properties to LPG that possibly enable adoption of LPG infrastructure to process DME. Furthermore, DME can be easily synthesized from natural gas, coal, crude oil, and biomass [10–16]. For hydrogen generation using DME, steam reforming [15–20], and partial oxidation [12–14,21,22] have been investigated extensively using conventional pack bed type reactors. For these reactions, catalyst particles are dispersed on metal oxide carriers, typically on alumina powder. In practice, these metal oxide catalyst carriers are press formed in a ball shape and those balls are packed into pack bed reactors. Catalyst particles, usually precious metals, are impregnated on those metal oxide balls. During the impregnation, excessive amount of catalyst materials are impregnated deep into the metal oxide balls and not all of the impregnated catalyst particles may participate in the reaction, wasting expensive precious metals. Also, as PO of DME is exothermic, and the reaction could form hot spots in the reactor, leading to deactivation of the conventional pack bed catalyst. Metallic catalyst supports with thin layers of metal oxide carriers could be a solution for those problems by reducing excessive impregnation as metallic supports will not be impregnated and dissipating reaction heat through metallic support. However, it is not easy to have a good adhesion between metallic catalytic support and metal oxide carriers coated onto it due to the big difference between their thermal expansion coefficients. In order to overcome this problem, for example, anodization of aluminum plate was tried and successfully demonstrated. This one-body metal (aluminum)–metal oxide (alumina) structure could be successfully implemented as plates for microreactors [23–25]. However, reaction temperature of this structure is limited up to 600°C because the alumina structure cannot be maintained at higher temperature. Recently, we have demonstrated that the adhesion between metallic support and metal oxide carriers could be adequately strong to endure repeated thermal shock up to 700°C by using FeCrAl foam as metallic support and making the support surface rough [26]. As metallic support can be planar, it is ideal to be used in a microreactor. Microreactor technology is attracting more and more interest for hydrogen production reactions for their small volume, excellent mass and heat transfer properties, controllable short residence times, uniform flow patterns, and safe operation in explosive regimes [27]. Most importantly, high mass and heat transfer rates in microreactors lead to development of more efficient and compact fuel processing systems compared to conventional pack-bed systems [24,25]. The objective of this study is to demonstrate a microreactor system with a metallic catalyst support as an efficient and sustained source of hydrogen fuel using Rh catalyst materials for PO of DME at reaction temperature up to 750°C. We investigated the efficiency and the amount of the catalyst needed for the reaction in our microreactor and compared them with those of a conventional pack-bed reactor. By coating a thin layer of alumina on metal foam with good adhesion strength, we aimed to reduce the amount of precious metal impregnated on the alumina in the microreactor, while keeping the reactor efficiency as good as or better than conventional pack-bed reactors. Long term stability of the reactor was also compared to that of pack-bed reactor."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst support preparation,"2.1 Catalyst support preparation We used FeCrAl alloy foams as metallic catalyst support (Alantum). Their composition was 20wt% Cr, 6wt% Al and Fe balance. Average pore size of the foam was 800μm with 90% porosity [26]. The foam was cut 2cm×4cm in size (Fig. 1 ). It has specific surface area (SSA) of 8.7m2/L. Macroscopically porous metal foams are ideal for maximizing exposed surface area to the reactant gases. The sample pieces were cleaned in acetone bath under ultrasonic vibration for 10min and in distilled water for 10min. γ-Al2O3 powder was from AEROXIDE (AluC) and had SSA of 107m2/g. Washcoat suspension was prepared with a standard composition of 70g of γ-Al2O3, 90g of distilled water, and 1ml of nitric acid. γ-Al2O3 slurry was prepared by vigorous stirring of the suspension for 90min in an attrition mill. Desired solid content in the slurry was controlled by regulating the ratio of the amount of γ-Al2O3 to that of distilled water. Acidity (pH value) of the slurry was adjusted using nitric acid (HNO3). FeCrAl alloy foams were coated with the prepared washcoat by dipping the foams into the washcoat solution for 10s. As our previous research [26], the amount of γ-Al2O3 incorporated to FeCrAl foam was approximately 20wt% of FeCrAl foam. In a typical case, the weight of FeCrAl foam (2cm×4cm) used for microreactor was about 1.6g and loading of γ-Al2O3 was about 0.32g. After washcoat, they were dried by air blowing (20psi) to remove residual slurry. The washcoated FeCrAl foams were then dried thoroughly in an oven at 120°C for 1h, and subsequently calcined at 750°C for 3h. Heating and cooling rates of calcination were 3°C/min and 5°C/min, respectively [26]. Detailed analysis on the adhesion strength of γ-Al2O3 layer on FeCrAl foam under thermal and mechanical stresses was reported elsewhere [26]. In short, γ-Al2O3 layer on FeCrAl foam showed excellent adhesion under repeated thermal shock between room temperature and 700°C. When the temperature was held at 700°C for 1000h, there was no noticeable damage to the coated γ-Al2O3 layer. Under mechanical stress of ultrasonic vibration in petroleum ether, weight loss of γ-Al2O3 layer coated FeCrAl foam was negligible compared to other previous similar studies. It was thought to be due to minimal interfacial force built up by thermal and mechanical stress at the interface surface with thin ligaments in the metal foam in the order of 10μm [26]."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation RhCl3·xH2O (45.5% Rh content, Alfa aesar) was used as precursors for catalyst. Our previous study showed that metal concentration of 0.5wt% Rh had a good efficiency for PO of DME [24]. Considering this result, γ-Al2O3 washcoated FeCrAl foams were impregnated with Rh catalyst with 0.5 (1.8mg Rh), 0.1 (0.36mg Rh), and 0.05wt% (0.18mg Rh) of Rh loading (to the weight of γ-Al2O3 washcoat) as follows. Rh precursor was dissolved with stirring in required amount of water. γ-Al2O3 washcoated FeCrAl foams were dipped in the solution for 1min and dried at room temperature for 24h. In order to remove water and chloride, impregnated samples were further dried at 120°C for 1h and calcined at 750°C for 3h. For comparison, Rh catalyst were impregnated in spherical γ-Al2O3 balls (1.7–2.0mm, SSA 300m2/g) by the same method mentioned above with the same loading ratios. Rh-impregnated γ-Al2O3 balls were used in conventional pack bed reactor. The amount of γ-Al2O3 in the microreactor was the same with that in the pack bed reactor. For this reason, actual amount of Rh added to γ-Al2O3 washcoated FeCrAl foam was the same as that in γ-Al2O3 balls in the pack bed reactor for the same Rh loading wt%."
4,Surface area and pore size of prepared γ-Al2O3 supports,"2.3 Surface area and pore size of prepared γ-Al2O3 supports The BET method was used to measure specific surface area (SSA) and the BJH method was used to measure average pore size of prepared γ-Al2O3 supports (γ-Al2O3 washcoat on metal foams and γ-Al2O3 balls before and after Rh impregnation) by nitrogen sorption (ASAP 2000, Micromerities). Specific surface area (SSA) of γ-Al2O3 balls we used in a fixed bed system was 315.5m2/g. After Rh impregnation, the value was reduced to 164.2m2/g. SSA of γ-Al2O3 washcoat on FeCrAl foam was 102.3m2/g. After Rh impregnation, the value was 97.4m2/g. Average pore size of γ-Al2O3 balls was 44.9Å and that of γ-Al2O3 washcoat was 208.7Å, respectively."
5,Evaluation of catalytic activity in PO of DME,"2.4 Evaluation of catalytic activity in PO of DME Evaluation of the catalytic activity was carried out using a microreactor. Microreactor assembly with a Rh/γ-Al2O3 washcoated FeCrAl foam is shown in Fig. 2 . Laser welding was applied to seal the reactor for preventing gas leakage at high temperature. The gap where a metal foam is positioned was 1mm. Prepared microreactors were inserted in a parallel furnace. For comparison, pack bed reactors were prepared by inserting Rh impregnated γ-Al2O3 balls in a quartz tube (inner diameter 8mm, outer diameter 10mm). Gas analysis was carried out by gas chromatography (GC, CP3800 Varian) in TCD mode. Flow rates of nitrogen, oxygen, and DME were controlled using mass flow controllers (MFC, Kofloc). Before flowing into the reactor, all the reactant gases were well mixed by quartz fragments in a stainless tube. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) at the microreactor was 4376h−1 (based on the volume of washcoated γ-Al2O3) and that of pack-bed reactor was 3200h−1, where the flow speed of DME and oxygen were 6 and 5ml/min, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with 20ml/min. For catalytic efficiency calculation, both hydrogen yield and DME conversion rates were obtained using the following formula: H 2 Yield % = H 2 ( mol ) DME i ( mol ) × 3 × 100 % DME conversion % = 1 - DME f ( mol ) DME i ( mol ) × 100 % where DMEi =initial amount of DME, DMEf =final amount of DME after reaction. Heating rate for the reactor was 2.5°C/min and contact time of the reactant gases with catalyst was 2min. Resultant gas analysis was done at every 50°C beginning at 200°C up to 750°C. For long term efficiency tests at high temperature, reactors were kept at 700°C and reactant gases were supplied continuously for 10h. For quantitative GC analysis, standard gas with a composition of 20.9% H2, 14.8% CO, 19.9% CO2, 14.9% CH4, and 29.5% N2 was used as reference."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Performance of a Rh/γ-Al2O3 washcoated FeCrAl foam in a microreactor,"3.1 Performance of a Rh/γ-Al2O3 washcoated FeCrAl foam in a microreactor In order to evaluate our metal support-microreactor system, we prepared four kinds of samples as follows; (a) 0.5wt% Rh impregnated γ-Al2O3/FeCrAl foam/microreactor, (b) blank γ-Al2O3/FeCrAl foam/microreactor, (c) 0.5wt% Rh impregnated γ-Al2O3 balls/pack bed reactor, (d) blank γ-Al2O3 balls/pack bed reactor. Then we compared their efficiency for DME conversion and hydrogen yield between 200 and 750°C. Fig. 3 shows DME conversion rates of each reactor types. All the reactor types began the DME conversion at 250–300°C and the conversion rate reached 100% at around 500°C. However, among the reactor, (a) showed the best overall conversion rate between 300 and 500°C. Note that reactor (b) and (d), which are blank without catalyst particles, showed almost exactly the same conversion rates throughout the reaction temperature. In spite of lower surface area of the metallic foam/microreactor system than that of the pack bed system, this is thought to be due to better heat and mass transfer of the microreactor system than that of the pack bed system. Also, this observation suggests that, after catalyst particles dispersion, the better performance of the reactor (a) than that of the reactor (b) came from efficient dispersion of Rh particles on γ-Al2O3 layer coated on metal foam than on γ-Al2O3 balls. DME conversion rates were saturated when the reaction temperature was over 500°C (Fig. 3), and it was difficult to compare the performance of the reactors in terms of DME conversion at T >500°C. However, for hydrogen yield, difference was more dramatic and the reactor (a) shows the best overall performance again (Fig. 4 ). In addition, we could observed that hydrogen yield fluctuated more severely in the reactor (a) at high temperature (T >450°C). The yield reached the maximum at 450°C, then had a dip as reaction temperature went up, and it recovered the maximum yield at T >700°C again. This feature indicates that reaction kinetics of a system with metallic support in a microreactor is much faster than that of a pack bed reactor. This feature will be analyzed in detail in the next section. On the other hand, reactor (c) showed a plateau in hydrogen yield between 400 and 550°C, and the yield increased monotonically up to 750°C. Note that the experiments were done with a short exposure time of reactant gases to the reactor as described in the experimental section. As PO of DME is exothermic, it is believed that the metallic support/microreactors had a better thermal conductivity with better dissipation of reaction heat, leading to a better catalytic efficiency than that of pack-bed reactors at T =400–600°C. Conventional pack bed reactor (c) showed comparable hydrogen yield to that of the microreactor only at high temperature >650°C. Blank reactors ((b) and (d)) without Rh particles showed similar hydrogen yield up to 750°C and the yields were constantly lower than reactors with Rh particles. In order to investigate reaction mechanisms of PO of DME on 0.5wt% Rh impregnated γ-Al2O3/FeCrAl foam/microreactor, carbon containing species such as CO, CO2, and CH4 were analyzed at the same time with hydrogen yield measurement (Fig. 5 ). It is well known that the main reaction path is PO of DME in Eq. (1): (1) CH 3 OCH 3 + 1 2 O 2 → 2 CO + 3 H 2 However, depending on reaction temperature and gas ratio, other reactions such as complete oxidation in Eq. (2) can also occur. When the DME:oxygen ratio increases, the carbon in DME is not fully oxidized. On the other hand, when the DME:oxygen ratio decreases, full oxidation into H2O and CO2 can be promoted. In this study, the ratio was fixed at 6:5 [24]: (2) CH 3 OCH 3 + 3 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 3 H 2 O As CO yield (in Fig. 5) had almost the same trend as that of hydrogen yield (Fig. 4(a)) as reaction temperature went up, CO is thought to come from the reaction in Eq. (1). At the same time, Fig. 5 shows that CH4 formation occurred at T >350°C, reached the maximum at T =550–650°C, and decreased at T >650°C. Note that the increase in the CH4 yield was directly correlated with the decrease in the yield of hydrogen and CO. CH4 was thought to be created by methanization shown in Eqs. (3–5): (3) CH 3 OCH 3 → CH 4 + CO + H 2 (4) CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O (5) CH 3 + H → CH 4 As the reaction paths in Eqs. (3–5) consume CO and hydrogen, it is natural that hydrogen and CO yield had a dip at T ∼550°C, where CH4 production was high. When reaction temperature was over 650°C, hydrogen and CO yield increased again up to 750°C. This is because wet and dry CH4 reforming shown in Eqs. (6) and (7) began to occur in this temperature range. In other words, additional hydrogen from the reforming of CH4 is added at high temperature reaction (>750°C) as was shown in Fig. 4: (6) CH 4 + CO 2 → 2 CO + 2 H 2 (7) CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + 3 H 2 CO2 and H2O are thought to be produced by the complete oxidation of DME shown in Eq. (2). In Fig. 5, CO2 yield was high at low temperature (T <350°C) and decreased as temperature went up. Regarding the ratio of reactor diameter/particle diameter of our pack bed reactors, it was low (4–4.7) compared to most recommended ones (>10). These low ratios are usually used for lab-scale reactors or highly exothermal reactions [28]. Also, as we used low space velocities for our reaction (3000–4000 GHSV), we believe that the reactor efficiencies presented here were not limited by internal transport speed. Regarding our microreactor design, stagnant areas in the flow could exist in the reactor. However, as our space velocity is low, this should not be a problem to check the efficiency of our microreactor. In summary, overall reaction paths in our reaction condition could be summarized as follows. In the beginning at low temperature, complete oxidation of DME was more prevalent (T <350°C). As temperature went up, the reaction rate of complete oxidation of DME decreased and PO of DME developed. At T =450–650°C, methanazation of DME reduced the hydrogen and CO yield of PO of DME, but at T >650°C, reforming of produced CH4 with produced CO2 and H2O from complete oxidation of DME helped to increase hydrogen and CO yield."
8,Long-term stability of metallic support/microreactor system at high temperature,"3.2 Long-term stability of metallic support/microreactor system at high temperature As we observed in the previous section, hydrogen yield at T ∼450°C was similar to that at T ∼700°C for our metallic support/microreactor system (Fig. 4(a)). Still, hydrogen production at high temperature (T >700°C) is beneficial compared to that at low temperature (T ∼450°C) because there are much less CO2 and CH4 produced at high temperature. On the other hand, hydrogen yield of our metallic support/microreactor system was similar to that of conventional pack-bed system at high temperature (Fig. 4(a) and (c)). Note that results in the previous section were from reactions with a short time exposure of reactant gases to the reactors as described in the experimental section. Therefore, we investigated long time exposure and long term stability of our metallic support/microreactor system and compared the performance with that of conventional pack-bed rectors. In doing so, we also compared the amount of Rh used for our metallic support/microreactor system with that of conventional pack-bed reactors. At first, hydrogen yield of a 0.5wt% Rh impregnated γ-Al2O3/FeCrAl foam/microreactor was compared with that of a 0.5wt% Rh impregnated γ-Al2O3 balls/pack bed reactor at 700°C for 10h (Fig. 6(a)). As expected from the short exposure time experiments, over 90% hydrogen yield was reached for both of the reactors within about 30min and the yield was maintained for 10h. As the Rh content was thought to be enough to achieve high hydrogen yield, we reduced the wt% of Rh for the both reactors and repeated the long term exposure experiments. With 0.1wt% Rh, pack-bed reactor showed a little bit inferior hydrogen yield to that of metallic support/microreactor system (Fig. 6(b)). With further decrease of Rh content to 0.05wt%, the difference was more dramatic (Fig. 6(c)). Comparison in Fig. 6 (c) shows that for our metallic support/microreactor system, 0.05wt% Rh was already enough to maintain a very high hydrogen yield close to 100%, while that kind of hydrogen yield could be achieved with 10 times more Rh content for a pack-bed reactor (Fig. 6(a)). From this comparison, we can estimate that the effective depth on the skin of γ-Al2O3 balls and of the γ-Al2O3 layers on FeCrAl foams where the reactions actually occur would be at most a few tens of μm. This is because the thickness of γ-Al2O3 layer coated on FeCrAl foam in our microreactor was 20–40μm range (not shown) [26]. Rh particles imbedded deeper than that thickness in the γ-Al2O3 balls of the pack-bed reactor were practically not participating in the reactions. With 0.05wt% Rh content, we continued to evaluate long term stability of the reactors. Fig. 7 (a) shows hydrogen yield of the conventional pack bed reactor up to 150h of continuous running of the reactor at 700°C. After running for about 100h, hydrogen yield decreased down to about 10% within 30–40h. This was due to severe carbon coking of the γ-Al2O3 balls in the reactor (shown in figure). On the other hand, Fig. 7(b) shows stable hydrogen production at around 90% up to 1200h, about 10 times longer than that of the pack bed reactor, for our metallic support/microreactor system. After this long running time, our metallic support/microreactor system did not have any severe carbon coking. We believe that this absence of carbon coking was due to complicated and turbulent gas flow through the metal foam in the microreactor with more open space than that of conventional pack bed reactors densely packed with γ-Al2O3 balls."
9,Conclusion,"In this study, we prepared a microreactor system with metallic catalyst support and compared its catalytic efficiency and long term stability with those of a conventional pack bed reactor using partial oxidation of DME for production of hydrogen. The microreactor system had a thin layer of γ-Al2O3 on FeCrAl metal foam as catalyst support. The pack bed reactor had γ-Al2O3 balls densely packed in a quartz tube. With enough catalyst materials (0.5wt% Rh), both of the reactors showed good hydrogen yield higher than 90% at reaction temperature up to 750°C. However, with decreasing Rh content, the pack bed reactor showed deteriorating reaction efficiency while the microreactor maintained the efficiency. In the end, it turn out that 10 times more Rh content was necessary for the pack bed reactor than that needed for the microreactor in order to maintain similar reaction efficiency for long term hydrogen production. Regarding long term stability of the reaction, the pack bed reactor maintained hydrogen production only up to about 120h, while the microreactor maintained hydrogen production up to 1200h, about 10 times longer than that of pack bed reactors. This comparison shows superior reaction efficiency and stability of metallic support loaded microreactors over conventional ceramic support loaded pack bed reactors for exothermic and high temperature reactions."
