0,Introduction,"Water our gift of nature, is a valuable resource but nowadays it has been polluted by various organic and inorganic pollutants present in the industrial effluent which is of major concern [1]. Among the various pollutants, the heavy metals such as Pb, Cd, Hg, Cr, Zn etc. are in priority list of various environmental protection agencies. The toxic heavy metals are the main pollutants in environment especially in air, soil, and water which is producing objectionable effects, impairing the environmental welfare, reducing the quality of life and growing threat to humanity that may eventually cause death too. There are hundreds of sources of heavy metal pollution, including the coal, natural gas, paper, chlor-alkali industries and the untreated effluents from the industries leads to severe water pollution. The toxicological criteria and bioaccumulating tendency of heavy metals from industrial wastewater end up as permanent additions to the environment which poses a serious threat to human health and ecosystems [2]. Lead (Pb), is one among the non-physiological common environmental toxic heavy metal pollutant discharged into the natural waters from various industrial activities such as metal plating, oil refining [3]. Exposure of Pb(II) is recognized as major risk factor to human population since it causes clinical effects of toxicity due to its accumulation in bone and in some soft tissues, liver, kidney and brain leading to the serious health disorders such as encephalopathy, seizures, mental retardation, anemia and nephropathy [4]. Even at very low concentration in water, these toxic heavy metal Pb(II) ions are very harmful not only to the human beings but also for animals and hence the removal of Pb(II) is mainly concentrated in this study. The removal of heavy metal ions existed in water is always an issue because they cause a serious biological danger. Due to these toxic and adverse effects of heavy metals, most industries are advised to treat waste waters systematically so that the metal contents can be minimized their wastes. Numerous research efforts were done to develop methods such as precipitation, adsorption [5], ion-exchange [6], chemical oxidation [7], coagulation [8], flocculation[9], reverse osmosis, membrane filtration etc. to remove heavy metal ions, particularly in industrial waste streams and to subsequently reuse them. Unfortunately, all the above techniques have drawbacks including sludge production, cost and maintenance problems. When compared to all other methods, the most promising method for toxic heavy metal ion removal is the adsorption process which is producing superior effluent suitable for reuse without other pollutants, flexibility in design and operation, effectiveness, regeneration easiness and inexpensive nature [10]. Due to these advantages, the adsorption process is utilized in this study for the treatment purpose. Many materials have been evaluated as adsorbents for the heavy metal removal such as corn cob [11], saw dust [12], plant biomass [13], rice bran [14] and so on. However, these adsorbents possess low adsorption capacities, low efficiencies and large cost of post-processing and hence tremendous effort has been made in recent years to seek new adsorbents and develop new techniques. In recent years, the biopolymers have been considered as most promising materials for heavy metal ion removal purpose as they exist abundantly and may form a cost-effective end product. Natural polymers, especially polysaccharides that are readily available, inexpensive and biodegradable, possess numerous reactive groups able to participate in metal ion adsorption [15]. Chitosan based composites are being widely studied for water treatment and purification processes [16]. Chitosan based adsorbent materials are also characterized by certain limitations such as swelling, slow adsorption rate [17] and decreased adsorption capacity after several runs [18]. Hence in order to overcome limitations the different forms of chitosan has been introduced by many researchers. Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is a water soluble polysaccharide mainly obtained from the partial hydrolysis of chitosan consisting of 2 and 10 glucosamine units bounded via beta-1, 4-glycoside linkages [19]. Chitosan oligosaccharide have received much more interest since it possess distinctive physiological activities such as antifungal and antibacterial activity, immuno-enhancing effects, antitumor effects and have potential applications in the food, pharmaceutical, agricultural and environmental industries [20]. PVA is a synthetic hydrophilic polymer widely used as emulsificants, adhesives, in textile and paper industry applications and in the attainment of amphiphilic membranes for enzyme immobilization due to its excellent properties such as non toxic, bio-compatible, biodegradable, good mechanical properties, tensile strength, good fibre and film forming ability and flexibility [21]. The purpose of using polyvinyl alcohol in heavy metal removal is that the PVA has unpaired electrons while the heavy metals have valence shells and hence by the 18-electron rule the unpaired electrons of PVA will bond with the heavy metal ion valence shells resulting in the easy removal of heavy metal ions from water [22].Comparative studies on the removal of Zn (II) from wastewater using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofiber and (PVA) nanofiber/hydroxyapatite (HA) nanofiber has been investigated by Abd El-aziz and his coworkers [23]. The PVA-immobilized cells have been also proven to be efficient in the biodegradation of hazardous contaminants, including crystal violet [24], aromatic compounds [25], phenolic compounds [26] and as well as in the uptake of heavy metals by immobilized fungal biomass [27]. Silk fibroin, a naturally occurring protein produced by the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori [28] has been recognized as a potentially useful biomaterial due to its excellent long term biodegradability, chemical reactivity, mechanical properties, minimal flammability, and impressive biocompatibility. The silk fibroin possesses beta-sheet structures consisting of short side chain amino acids in the primary sequence which permit tight packing of piled sheets of hydrogen bonded anti-parallel protein chains. Chang Seok ki and his coworkers reported about the excellent performance of silk fibroin and Wool keratose/Silk fibroin blend nanofibrous membranes as a heavy metal ion adsorbent prepared by electrospinning process [29]. The adsorption capacity of the polyethyleneimine coated nanofi-brous SF nonwovens were also examined using copper ions as a model heavy metal ion [30]. The formations of more number of reactive groups on the polymer chains by chemical modifications on adsorbents have shown great promise in improving their adsorption capacity, selectivity and physicochemical properties [31]. The blending and grafting of synthetic polymers are the convenient method to add new properties to a natural polymer with minimum loss of the initial properties of the substrate. Maleic anhydride has been used recently for the functionalization of polyolefins due to the higher reactivity of the anhydride group toward successive reactions and ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) is an efficient oxidizing agent that can create free radicals capable of initiating graft copolymerization of vinyl monomers onto polysaccharides [32]. Hence in the present work initially the graft copolymerization of maleic anhydride onto chitosan oligosaccharide was carried out using ceric ammonium nitrate as an initiator followed by the blending of the prepared COS-g-MAH copolymer with PVA and Silk fibroin. The PVA and silk fibroin strengthens chitosan oligosaccharide by forming H bonds with the amino group of the COS molecule and by introducing additional active sites for adsorption. Based on the literature review an attempt has been made to utilize an inexpensive adsorbent system (chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/silk fibroin composite) for the removal of toxic heavy metal lead (II) from aqueous solution using batch reaction approach as a function of various parameters such as pH, adsorbent dose, contact time and initial metal ion concentration. The adsorption isotherms such as Langmuir and Freundlich models were used to fit with the adsorption equilibrium data and the adsorption kinetic models such as pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models were investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The chitosan oligosaccharide was kind gift from India Sea foods, Cochin, Kerala. Cocoons of Bombyx mori were obtained from the sericulture farm in Vaniyambadi, Vellore District. The chemicals namely the polyvinyl alcohol and maleic anhydride was purchased from Merck, Mumbai, India and Thomas Baker Chemicals Private Ltd, Mumbai. The initiator ceric ammonium nitrate (Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6) was procured from Thomas bakers chemicals and all the reagents used in the present research work were of analytical grade."
3,Preparation of silk,"2.2 Preparation of silk In order to remove the sericin, the Bombyx mori silk was boiled in 0.5% wt of Na2CO3 aqueous solution for 40min, then rinsed three times successively in distilled water and soaked in distilled water over night. The degummed silk was dried in an oven at 600°C for 7h."
4,Preparation of chitosan oligosaccharide-g-maleic anhydride,"2.3 Preparation of chitosan oligosaccharide-g-maleic anhydride About 5g of chitosan oligosaccharide was dissolved in 30ml of water and stirred well to form a homogeneous solution. 2.5g of maleic anhydride monomer dissolved in 30ml of water was then added to the above prepared homogenous (COS) solution. In order to initiate the polymerization process in the above mixture, the initiator ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) (0.5g of CAN in 10ml of 1N HNO3) was added and after all the addition was over, the above mixture was heated to 70 ∘C and simultaneously the stirring of that mixture was performed for a period of approximately 30min using a magnetic stirrer. After a time period of 30min, the above solution was poured into excess sodium hydroxide (2N) solution to precipitate the graft copolymer. Finally, the obtained graft copolymer precipitated was then filtered, dried and weighed."
5,Preparation of chitosan oligosaccharide-g-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin (1:1:0.25) composite,"2.4 Preparation of chitosan oligosaccharide-g-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin (1:1:0.25) composite About 1g of the above prepared chitosan oligosaccharide-g-maleic anhydride copolymer (COS-g-MAH) was dissolved in minimum amount of water. A required amount of polyvinyl alcohol (1.0ml) dissolved in minimum amount of hot water was added to the above prepared COS-g-MA copolymer solution which was then kept under constant magnetic stirring for about half an hour. After this process is over, the required amount of silk fibroin (0.25g) prepared in the above manner chopped into fine pieces of around 0.1cm was sprinkled over evenly onto the COS-g-MAH copolymer/PVA solution mixture followed by the effective blending process using the magnetic stirrer for a period of 30min and then finally poured into petri plates, allowed to dry for few hours."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization 2.5.1 Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy studies The FT-IR spectrum of the prepared samples was recorded by Perkin Elmer 200 FTIR spectrophotometer instrument operated in the wave number range from 4000cm−1 to 450cm−1 during 64 scans, with 2cm−1 resolution. 2.5.2 X-Ray diffraction studies The X-ray diffraction patterns of COS-g-MA/PVA/SF composite was measured using X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD- SHIMADUZ XD-D1) with Ni filter Cu Kα radiation source (λ=0.154nm), set at scan rate=10°/min, using a voltage of 40kv and a current of 30mA. 2.5.3 Biosorption experiment Batch equilibrium technique was implemented to examine the applicability of COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite for the uptake of Pb(II) from aqueous solution by varying different parameters such as pH, adsorbent dose, contact time and initial metal ion concentration. The synthetic lead (II) solution (200mg/L) was initially prepared by dissolving 0.3197g of lead nitrate in 1000ml of deionised water. The metal ion adsorption experiments was carried out by soaking 1g of COS-g-MAH/PVA/Silk fibroin composite in 100ml of the above prepared specified lead (II) solution (200mg/L). The adjustment of the initial pH of the sample solutions was accomplished with 1M HCl and 1M NaOH. This solution mixture was then equilibrated in orbital shaker at a speed of 200rpm for about 60min at 30°C. After the shaking process is over, the solution mixture was filtered using Whattmann filter paper and the supernatant was taken for AAS analysis of metal ion concentration. A similar procedure was carried out by varying the adsorbent dose, pH and time of contact. The metal ion removal percentage (%) and the adsorption capacity (mg/g) was calculated based on the following equations Removal ( % ) = Initial metal ion con c − Final metal ion conc Initial metal ion con c × 100 Adsor ption capacity ( qe ) = ( C o − C e ) × V m where Ce (mg/L) is the liquid phase concentrations of metal ion at equlibrium, Co (mg/L) is the initial concentration of the metal ion in solution, V is the volume of the solution (L) and W is the mass of dry adsorbent (g)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Mechanism,"3.1 Mechanism The newly functionalized chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin (COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF) is regarded as a composite of different functional groups that are expected to form various coordination complexes with metal ions. The functional groups responsible for binding with heavy metal ions are generally in the form of amine (-NH2) and hydroxyl (-OH). Based on the results obtained by various researchers [33] the following mechanism was proposed for the formation of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer (Fig. 1 (a)). In addition, the mechanism of formation of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/sik fibroin composite and the binding of Pb(II) ions onto chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin composite was also represented in Fig. 1 (b) and (c)."
9,FT-IR spectral analysis,"3.2 FT-IR spectral analysis FT-IR spectroscopy is one of the most important and widely used analytical techniques available for scientists [34] to identify organic, polymeric and in some cases, inorganic materials. The FTIR spectrum of the pure chitosan oligosaccharide, chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer and chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin composite was represented in Fig. 2 (a)–(c). The FT-IR spectrum of pure chitosan oligosaccharide presented in Fig. 2 (a) shows the prominent peaks at 3410.15cm−1 and 2926.01cm−1 which was assigned to OH, NH stretching [35] and aliphatic asymmetrical CH stretching vibration in methylenic group [36] respectively. The peaks which were observed at 1631.78cm−1, 1516.05cm−1,1433.11cm−1 and 1253.73cm−1 show the presence of CO stretching, NH bending in amines, OH in plane bending in alcohols and COC linkage respectively. The CN stretching and NH wagging vibration corresponds to the peaks at 1083.99cm−1 and 775.38cm−1 respectively. Fig. 2(b) displays the FTIR spectrum of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer. The broad FTIR peak obtained at 3332.99cm−1 indicate the presence intermolecular hydrogen bonded OH stretching and NH stretching respectively. Doublet appearing at 2929.87cm−1 and 2870.08cm−1were assigned to aliphatic asymmetrical and symmetrical CH stretching in methylenic group [37]. Certain strong peaks obtained at 1658.78cm−1, 1548.84cm−1 and 1402.25cm−1 was attributed to the CC stretching in alkenes, NH bending in amines and COH bending in acids. Peaks located at 1344.38cm−1, 1149.57cm−1, 1076.28cm−1, 1018.41cm−1, 941.26cm−1 and 644.22cm−1 belong to CO stretching in acids, COC linkage, OCC band of esters of primary alcohol, CO stretching in alcohols, out of plane bending of bonded OH group and NH wagging respectively. The FT-IR spectrum of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silf fibroin composite was represented in Fig. 2 (c). Several characteristic peaks appeared at 3419.79cm−1 and 3159.40cm−1 was mainly due to presence of different symmetrical stretching of different types of amine (NH2), hydroxyl (OH) functional groups [38] in acids and alcohols. The strong peak observed at 2927.94cm−1 may be attributed to the CH stretching in methyl group. Certain strong peaks obtained at 1641.42cm−1 (amide-I) and 1560.41cm−1 (amide-II), corresponding to the silk II structural conformation (β-sheet) [39]. The intense transmittance bands at 1384.89cm−1, 1311.59cm−1, 1145.72cm−1, 1078.21cm−1, 900.76cm−1 and 848.68cm−1 are due to the specificity of the deformation band of the hydroxyl group in alcohols, stretching band of CO group in acids, stretching band of CO group in esters, COC linkage, stretching band of CC group and NH wagging respectively. On comparing the FT-IR spectral details of pure chitosan oligosaccharide with the chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer it was observed that certain new peaks appeared at 1658.78cm−1 and 1402.25cm−1 corresponding to the presence of CC and COH bending in acids. The observance of these new main peaks suggests that the maleic anhydride monomer gets grafted effectively onto the chitosan oligosaccharide polymer which demonstrates the favourable grafting process. The comparison of FT-IR spectrum of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer with pure chitosan oligosaccharide and chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin composite reveals that extra additional peaks were appeared due to the presence of CH stretching in methyl group, amide-I and amide-II stretching due to the silk fibroin in case of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin composite and in addition, the position of certain peaks appeared due to the presence of NH, OH and CC stretching was also shifted to the various wavenumbers. These new peaks, shifting of peak positions and change in the intensity of the characteristic peaks may be because of the decrease of intermolecular hydrogen bonding of chitosan oligosaccharide[40] and forming new hydrogen bonding between chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer, silk fibroin and polyvinyl alcohol molecules. This observed new peaks and the shift in peak positions suggest that the silk fibroin and polyvinyl alcohol gets blended effectively with the chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer and it was also reported that all of these binding groups have high efficiency for adsorption of heavy metals ions from wastewater."
10,X-ray diffraction studies,"3.3 X-ray diffraction studies The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) is a rapid analytical technique primarily used for phase identification of a crystalline material and can provide information on unit cell dimensions. The X-ray diffractogram details of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer and chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin composite was represented in Figs. 3 and 4 . The X-ray diffractogram of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer presented in Fig. 3 shows large number of sharp peaks at various 2θ values such as 11.5°, 14.3°,17.4°, 20.0°, 22.4°, 25.9°,33.9°,40.2° and so on. From the increase in the number of peaks, it was concluded that the crystallinity of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer was found to be increased. The addition of maleic anhydride monomer to the chitosan oligosaccharide polymer increases the crystalline nature of chitosan oligosaccharide. The XRD pattern of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin composite (Fig. 4) showed a wide band at 2θ: 40.297° and 46.657° which indicated the presence of an amorphous phase. The shifting of crystallographic peaks obtained at around various 2θ values in case of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer to higher values 2θ: 40.297° and 46.657° conclude that there is a strong interaction [41] occurred between chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride with polyvinyl alcohol and silk molecules. The diffraction peaks were observed with either shifted towards higher angle or with small broadening and decreased intensity.The limitation in crystallization of the prepared composite is possibly due to hydrogen bonded interactions between silk fibroin, polyvinyl alcohol with chitosan-graft maleic anhydride copolymer chains thus stabilizing the silk fibroin molecular structure [42,43]. The broad amorphous peak indicating that there was a molecular miscibility and an interaction between the three components such as chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride, polyvinyl alcohol and silk fibroin. The deformation of the crystalline regions (disruption of amino, carbonyl group, hydroxyl groups) happens by the increased packing of chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol and silk fibroin. The XRD results proved the interaction among three added polymeric components and the calculated lower percentage degree of crystallinity values showed that the prepared composite has highly amorphous nature suitable for the adsorption process"
11,Batch adsorption studies,"3.4 Batch adsorption studies 3.4.1 Effect of pH A well characterized important factor is the pH of the aqueous solution which plays a vital role in metal ion adsorption process. Since the pH of the solution controls the surface charge of the adsorbent and the degree of ionization of the adsorbate it has a major impact on the lead uptake amount. The contribution of pH on the metal ion uptake properties of COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite toward Pb(II) ions were studied in pH 3.0-8.0 at room temperature and the results of this study was represented in Fig. 5 . From the results presented in Fig. 5 it was evident that the percentage of lead (II) sorption process were found to gradually increase from pH 1.0 to pH 4.0 followed by a significant increase to a maximum value at pH 6.0 and thereafter it declines. The maximum percentage removal of Pb(II) and the maximum adsorption capacity observed at pH 6 was found to be 82.06% and 16.412mg/g respectively. The obtained lesser removal efficiency at low pH was mainly due to the partial protonation of the lone pair electrons of N and O atom and a competitive adsorption between H+ and metal ions which hinders the corresponding COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite–metal complex [44]. The significant increase in Pb(II) uptake in the range of pH 3.0-6.0, is mainly due to the decreased competition between the H+ and Pb(II) ions and the decrease in the positive charge of the functional groups [45].The lesser uptake of Pb(II) beyond optimum pH (pH=6) might be due to the deposition of lead as lead hydroxide species. The formation of these hydroxylated complexes of metal ions hindered the metal-binding capacity. 3.4.2 Effect of contact time The contact time is an effective factor in a batch process. The effect of contact time was evaluated by changing the contact time from 60 mins to 300 mins by keeping all the parameters such as initial concentration of lead ions (200ppm), adsorbent dose (1g/l), pH (6) as constant. The effect of contact time on the adsorption of Pb(II) onto COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite was investigated using the batch technique and the obtained results was represented in Fig. 6 . The result outlined in this study (Fig. 6) concludes that at the initial stage, the adsorption process was however very rapid but as the reaction approached the equilibrium stage, it slows down. The reason behind the fact is that the sorption processes of Pb(II) ion by COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite sorbent was found to follow two successive steps. The first step involves a rapid increase in the percentage removal of the Pb(II) ion owing to the abundant and availability of active binding sites on surface which permits the rapid accumulation of Pb (II) ions on the pore sites of the COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite [46]. The second step is that beyond a certain contact time (180min), due to the complete saturation of the sorbent surface with the metal ions i.e. the active sites occupation the equilibrium is reached [47] and hence it shows a constant percentage removal. The maximum percentage removal and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 93.18% and 18.64mg/g respectively. 3.4.3 Effect of adsorbent dose In order to determine the effect of the biosorbent dosage on the biosorption efficiency of COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite, the amount of biosorbent added into the biosorption medium were varied from 1g to 5g/100ml by keeping other variables such as initial concentration of lead ions (200mg/L), contact time: 60mins and pH (6) as constant. Fig. 7 represents the effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption behavior of Pb(II) onto the COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite. The results of this study indicate that upon increasing the adsorbent dosage, it shows an increased percentage removal of Pb(II). With increase in the biosorbent dosage, from 1g to 5g/100ml, the percentage removal of Pb(II) increased from 82.06% to 93.75%, which is the maximum value obtained as the number of possible binding sites increased [48]. From the results presented in Fig. 7 it was evident that the optimum adsorbent dosage was found to be 4g/100ml. Upon increasing the adsorbent mass, the availability of active sites for coordination and binding with the target metal ion was increased and hence it shows an increased percentage removal but beyond optimum adsorbent dosage (4g/100ml), due to the overlapping or aggregation of adsorption sites the total adsorbent surface area available to the metal ions decreases and hence it leads to the equilibrium situation resulting in the constant Pb(II) percentage removal [49]. 3.4.4 Effect of initial metal ion concentration The accumulation of metal at the interface between the solid/liquid phases is generally termed as the metal adsorption which is a mass transfer process. The initial metal concentration is an important factor in determining the adsorption potency of a biomass. The influence of metal ion concentration on the adsorption behavior of Pb(II) ion onto COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite was investigated by varying it in the range of 1000, 750, 500, 250 and 125mg/L, while keeping the other parameters at a constant value. Fig. 8 shows the equilibrium adsorption uptake of the sorbent at different initial heavy metal ions concentrations. The results presented in Fig. 8 reveals that the percent adsorption decreased with increase in initial lead (II) ion concentration. At lower metal ion concentration, the ratio of the initial number of lead ion to the available surface area is low [50] and hence it shows an increased percentage removal. At higher initial metal ion concentration, the available binding sites for adsorption becomes lesser when compared to the Pb(II) ions, saturation of the adsorption sites of the adsorbent happens by the metal ion[51] and hence it results in the decreased percentage removal of Pb(II). The decrease in percentage of adsorption with an increase in initial metal ion concentration might also be due to the increased driving force which develops the concentration gradient between the bulk solution and surface of the COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite adsorbent [52]."
12,Adsorption isotherms,"3.5 Adsorption isotherms Equilibrium adsorption isotherm models were mainly employed to describe the equilibrium distribution of sorbed molecules between the solid and liquid phases [53] and also help in determining the capacity of the adsorbent, affinity of adsorbent and the surface properties. This equilibrium adsorption isotherm is essential to determine the capacity and mechanisms to optimize the design of the sorption system. The thermodynamic equilibrium between the specific amounts of metal ions adsorbed onto the surface of a solid (native or functionalized) and the metal ion concentration remaining in solution was understood by the adsorption isotherms. Several adsorption isotherm models such as Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Sipps, Dubinin Radushkevich, Toth, Redlich Peterson etc. are available for evaluation of the experimental sorption equilibrium data which have been mainly used to fit the adsorption equilibrium [54]. Among the various adsorption isotherm models, in the present work, the most widely used two models namely Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm were utilized to describe the reaction of Pb(II) ions with COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite surface. 3.5.1 Langmuir adsorption isotherm In Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, reversible monolayer adsorption process takes place on a homogenous surface with uniform sorption energies onto the surface without interactions between the adsorbed species. The linearised form of Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was expressed as follows Ceq/Cads =bCeq/KL +1/KL Cmax =KL/b where, Cads =amount of metal ion adsorbed (mg.g−1) Ceq =equilibrium concentration of remaining metal ion in solution (mg.dm−3) KL =Langmuir constant (dm3.g−1) b=Langmuir constant (dm3.mg−1) Cmax =Maximum metal ion to adsorb onto 1g adsorbent (mg.g−1) The Langmuir adsorption isotherm plot of Ceq/Cads vs. Ceq for Pb(II) ions onto COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite was represented in Fig. 9 . The shape of the Langmuir isotherm was predicted by the seperation factor RL, which is a dimensionless constant mainly helps in predicting the favourability of Langmuir isotherm for equilibrium data. The separation factor RL can be calculated using the following expression [55]. RL =1/1+bCf where b (L/mg) refers to the Langmuir constant and Cf is denoted to the adsorbate final concentration (mg/L). Four different values of RL, the equilibrium parameter like RL =1, RL =0, RL ˃1 and 0˂RL ˂1 was reported by many researchers [56]. These four values symbolize linear adsorption, irreversible adsorption, unfavourable and favourable adsorption process respectively. The calculated values of the separation factor (RL) were shown in Table 1 . In the present study since the calculated values of RL (Table 1) was found to be greater than 0 and less than 1 (0<RL < 1), it was concluded that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite was considered to be favorable and the adsorption process would be spontaneous. 3.5.2 Freundlich isotherm model Freundlich model describes the distribution of solute between solid and aqueous phases at the point of saturation. This model mainly assumes heterogeneous surface with a nonuniform distribution of biosorption over the surface and the site energies of biosorbent vary exponentially. The linearised form of Freundlich isotherm is as follows [57]: log qe =logKf +1/n log Ce where Kf and 1/n are Freundlich isotherm constants related to adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively. The adsorption isotherm, Kf is the indicator of the adsorption capacity and n is the heterogeneity factor representing the deviation from linearity of adsorption and is also known as Freundlich coefficient [58]. The Freundlich adsorption isotherm plot of lead (II) onto COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite was represented in Fig. 10 . Table 2 shows the Langmuir constants (KL, b and C max) and freundlich constants (Kf and n) calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of Ceq/Cads Vs. Ceq and loq qe against log Ce. The calculated higher Cmax values from Langmuir plot suggest that the prepared COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite has more potential to remove Pb(II) from aqueous solution. In Freundlich adsorption isotherm model, the prediction of 1/n values indicate the type of isotherm to be either irreversible(1/n =0), favorable(0<1/n<1), unfavorable(1/n>1) [59]. From Table 2, it is evident that the value of n of freundlich model falling in the range of 1–10 and hence the calculated results suggest that the adsorption of metal ions onto COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite biosorbents was found to be highly favourable suggesting multilayer phenomenon. Based on the higher R2 values it was concluded that the Langmuir isotherm was the most suitable for the absorption of Pb(II) onto chitosan oligosaccharide-graft/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin composite suggesting that the monolayer chemisorption process takes place effectively."
13,Biosorption kinetics,"3.6 Biosorption kinetics Kinetic investigation was performed to determine the suitable model for the reaction rates and mechanism based on the optimum conditions developed throughout the experiments. In the present work, the controlling mechanisms of biosorption process, chemical reaction, diffusion control and the mass transfer process [60] was examined by utilizing several kinetic models namely pseudo first order, pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion model. 3.6.1 Pseudo first order kinetics The pseudo-first-order kinetic model is given by following equation: log ( q e − q t ) = log q e − k 1 t 2.303 where qe and qt (mgg−1) are the adsorption capacities at equilibrium and at time t (h), respectively, k1 is the rate constant of the pseudo first-order adsorption process (min−1).The different kinetic parameters for the pseudo-first-order model can be obtained from the slope and intercept of plot of log (qe-qt) versus t. The pseudo first order kinetic plot obtained for the removal of lead(II) ions by COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite was represented in Fig. 11 . 3.6.2 Pseudo second order kinetics When compared to the pseudo first order kinetic model, the pseudo-second order model is generally more appropriate to represent kinetic data of heavy metals biosorption [61]. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model is given by following equation: t q t = 1 h + t q e where h=k2 qe 2 (mgg−1 min−1) usually described as the initial adsorption rate as t approaches 0 and k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second-order adsorption (gmg−1min−1). Plotting t/qt versus time (t) enables determination of the pseudo-second-order kinetic parameters. Fig. 12 represents the pseudo second order kinetic plot for the removal of lead (II) ions by COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite. 3.6.3 Intraparticle diffusion kinetics In order to understand the mechanism of the adsorption process, Weber and Morris [62] proposed an adsorption model, which is renowned as intraparticle diffusion model. The linearized form of this model is expressed as follows qt =kid t1/2 +C where C is the intercept which represent the boundary layer effect and kid is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant (mg/g min1/2) respectively. The values of kid and C were evaluated from the slope and intercept of the second linear portion of the plots of qt versus t1/2.The intraparticle diffusion kinetic plot for the removal of lead (II) ions by COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite was represented in Fig. 13 . The three linear portions present in the curve (Fig. 13) indicate that more than one process is responsible for adsorption. The first sharper portion signifies boundary layer diffusion process of metal ions whereas the second and third portions denote the gradual adsorption of metal ions onto COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite and equilibrium stage which represent the intraparticle diffusion process[63]. Since the equilibrium plots do not pass through the origin, it concludes that the intraparticle diffusion is not only the rate limiting step but some boundary layer effect is also responsible [64] in this case. Respective parameters and correlation coefficients derived from pseudo first order, pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetic plots are summarized in Table 3 . The results presented in Figs. 11–13 and Table 3 reveals that the linear regression indicates an excellent statistical validity for the pseudo-second order kinetics, as shown by the statistical parameters. The correlation coefficients obtained were close to one (R2 =0.9995) for Pb(II) adsorption onto COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite in case of pseudo second order kinetics and hence from the obtained higher R2 value it was evident that the biosorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model when compared to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and intraparticle diffusion kinetic model. In addition to this, the excellent agreement of theoretical loading capacity (qe) values derived from pseudo second order plots with the experimental values (qe) calculated from kinetic experiments also agrees with the applicability of pseudo second order kinetic model for COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite. The above observations conclude that the adsorption of lead (II) ions onto COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite follows pseudo second order kinetic model. Sudha and his coworkers reported about the prepared chitosan-g-maleic anhydride-g-ethylene dimethacrylate copolymer to remove the heavy metals chromium from aqueous solutions. The calculated results revealed that the maximum amount of Cr(VI) adsorbed was found to be 141.46mg/g, the adsorption favours Freundlich isotherm and follows pseudo-second order kinetics [65]. The removal of copper ions from aqueous solution by adsorption onto novel polyelectrolyte film-coated nanofibrous silk fibroin non-wovens has been carried out by Weitao Zhou and his coworkers. The maximum milligrams per gram of copper ions adsorbed reached 59.7mg/g when the SF substrate was coated with 5 bilayers of SF-PEI. However, the copper ions adsorption capacity had no obvious change as the number of PEI continued to increase. These results suggest potential for PEL film-coated nanofibrous nonwovens as a new adsorbent for metal ions [66]. The comparison of the adsorption capacity values with the reported literature reveals that this prepared chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride(COS-g-MAH)/Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/silk fibroin (SF) composite is found to be a better adsorbent with higher adsorption capacity (>150mg/g) in removing heavy metals."
14,Thermodynamic parameters,"3.7 Thermodynamic parameters The thermodynamic parameters were mainly calculated to analyze thermodynamic feasibility, spontaneity and thermal effects of sorption. The thermodynamic parameter (change in the free Gibbs energy (ΔG)) is calculated from the Langmuir constant using following equation as follows ΔG=−RT ln KL where R is the universal gas constant (8.314J/molK),KL is Langmuir constant and T is the absolute temperature. For Pb(II) the KL value was calculated to be=0.8460(dm3/g) and T=25°C and hence based on the above equation, the calculated change in free energy (ΔG) value was found to be 417.12 KJ/mol. From the obtained positive value of ΔG, it is evident that the adsorption of Pb(II) ions by chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride (COS-g-MAH)/Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/silk fibroin (SF) composite had shown the non-spontaneous nature of the adsorption process [67]."
15,Conclusion,"In this research, a novel chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin (COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF) composite was synthesized and evaluated for the removal of Pb(II) from aqueous solution. The characteristics of COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF composite were studied using the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and XRD, which confirmed the successful modification process. The results of this investigation showed that the chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin composite has the effective biosorption capacity for the removal of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions under optimum conditions. The optimum adsorption parameters were found to be given as follows: pH: 6; contact time: 180min, adsorbent dosage: 4g/100ml and initial metal ion concentration: 125mg/L. With the increase of adsorbent dosage, contact time and the decrease of initial metal concentration, the removal efficiency increased. The experimental results were analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich models and kinetic models. The obtained results indicate that the Langmuir equation show a better fit and biosorption kinetic studies of Pb(II) was found to conform to pseudo-second-order model. The results of this research indicated that the novel chitosan oligosaccharide-graft-maleic anhydride/polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin (COS-g-MAH/PVA/SF) composite could be employed as an efficient and cost effective biopolymer for the removal of heavy metals from effluents."
