0,Introduction,"Irreproducible fossil fuel combustion produces carbon dioxide and other waste gases causing environmental problems. The development of alternative energy resources is desired. Molecular hydrogen (H2), with its high conversion efficiency, recyclability and environment friendly nature, is an excellent alternative energy in future for human beings [1]. Microbial hydrogen production process is environment friendly and less energy intensive compared to chemical processes [2]. Microbial hydrogen production is classified into two categories. One is hydrogen production by photosynthetic microorganisms such as algae [3] and photosynthetic bacteria [4]. The other is that by fermentative hydrogen-producing microorganisms such as facultative anaerobes [5] and obligate anaerobes [6]. Compared to photosynthetic microorganisms, fermentative hydrogen-producing microorganisms are more preferred as hydrogen can be produced in reactor continuously without extra supply of light. During the fermentation by hydrogen-producing microorganisms, organic acids are produced as by-products, while the accumulation of them will result in the decrease of pH and inhibit hydrogen production by bacteria correspondingly. Thus, to attain higher hydrogen yields, near neutral or weak acidic pH control according to the variation of fermentation broth will be the best way out. However, pH control is an uneconomical operation considering the large amounts of alkali needed for a large-scale process to maintain effective and stable hydrogen production. Therefore, it might be cost-effective to utilize aciduric microorganisms whose lower limit of pH for hydrogen production could reduce the alkali consumption to the highest degree. Therefore, if hydrogen-producing bacterium and aciduric microorganisms are cultured in the same reactor for hydrogen production, it is assumed that stable and high-yielding hydrogen production will be performed under low pH conditions. To date however, there are few reports about the isolation and application of such an aciduric facultative anaerobe in hydrogen production [7]. In our previous paper, a bioflocculant-producing strain named Enterobacter aerogenes W-23 was isolated [8], which also exhibits a high-producing hydrogen ability. In this paper, the isolation of an aciduric yeast which can produce hydrogen under acidic pH was performed, and the capability of stable hydrogen production by a mixed culture of this aciduric yeast and E. aerogenes W-23 and the optimum conditions for hydrogen production were further investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Screening for aciduric hydrogen-producing microorganism,"2.1 Screening for aciduric hydrogen-producing microorganism Microorganisms with ability to produce hydrogen under acidic pH condition were screened from active sludge from Jizhuangzi Sewage Farm using a basal medium A (pH 4.0) consisting of 2.0% glucose, 1.0% peptone, 0.05% MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 0.1% KH2PO4 and 0.05% (NH4)2SO4. 5ml of the active sludge with optical density of 0.5 was inoculated into the 100ml serum bottle containing 50ml of the above basal medium A and sealed with rubber tap. Cultures were incubated anaerobically in a rotary shaker at 120rpm for 24h at 35 ∘ C . After an anaerobic enrichment culture in the basal medium, facultative anaerobes were obtained by aerobic streak-plate culture on an agar basal medium at 35 ∘ C . The isolated microorganisms were cultured again in the basal medium (pH 4.0) anaerobically. The gas production was collected and analyzed, and the hydrogen-producing microorganisms were selected based on the hydrogen yield."
3,Hydrogen production by monoculture,"2.2 Hydrogen production by monoculture Aciduric microorganisms was precultured anaerobically in the basal medium A at 35 ∘ C for 14h. After centrifugation of the precultured broth at 8500 × g for 10min, harvested cells were washed with a physiological saline and suspended in the saline to get a cell suspension (optical density 1.0). 30ml of the cell suspension was inoculated into a 2l flask with 1.5l basal medium A, and the gas phase was replaced with nitrogen gas. The cultivation was conducted anaerobically at 35 ∘ C with stirring speed of 180rpm. Bacterium was precultured anaerobically in a rotary shaker at 35 ∘ C for 12h in the basal medium (pH 6.5) B consisting of 0.5% glucose, 1.0% peptone, 0.02% MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 0.4% K2HPO4, 0.6% KH2PO4, 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.2% (NH4)2SO4. The precultured broth was centrifuged at 8500 × g for 10min and the harvested cells were washed with a physiological saline. After centrifugation, cells were suspended in the physiological saline to get a cell suspension (optical density 1.0). 30ml of the cell suspension was inoculated into a 2l flask with 1.5l basal medium B, and the gas phase was replaced with nitrogen gas. The cells were cultured anaerobically in a rotary shaker at 35 ∘ C with stirring speed of 180rpm. In these two cultivations, gas produced was collected and the volume was measured in an inverted measuring cylinder over a 5mol/l NaOH solution, respectively. The gas yield and the hydrogen production rate were periodically measured, respectively. The gas volumes were corrected to normal conditions: 25 ∘ C ; 1atm."
4,Hydrogen production by mixed culture,"2.3 Hydrogen production by mixed culture 20ml of the cell suspension of E. aerogenes W-23 and 10ml of the cell suspension of Candida maltosa HY-35 with both of the optical density 1.0 were inoculated into a 2l flask with 1.5l basal medium B, followed by the replacement of the gas phase with nitrogen gas. The cells were cultured anaerobically in a rotary shaker at 35 ∘ C with stirring speed of 180rpm."
5,Analyses,"2.4 Analyses Hydrogen was determined using a Kechuang GC9800 gas chromatograph (Shanghai, China) equipped with stainless steel column ( 3 mm ∅ × 2 m , TDX-01 as the carrier) and TCD thermal conductivity detector. Carrier gas was nitrogen, and column temperature was 80 ∘ C . Glucose and lactate concentration in culture broth were determined by a SBA-50 glucose-lactic acid biosensor analyzer (Shandong, China). Cell concentration in culture broth was determined by measuring the optical density at 600nm. The concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols in the culture broth were analyzed by the gas chromatography of the same model equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 10 m × 0.53 mm HP-FFAP fused-silica capillary column. The VFA analyzed included acetate and butyrate, whereas the alcohols included ethanol and 2,3-butanediol. Samples were first filtered through a 0.2 μ m membrane, acidified by formic acid and measured for free acids. The initial temperature of the column was 70 ∘ C for 3min followed with a ramp of 10 ∘ C / min and a final temperature of 180 ∘ C for 4min. The temperature of the injector and detector were 200 and 250 ∘ C , respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25ml/min. A reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of succinate in the broth was developed. Eclipse XDB-CB8 column ( 4.6 mm i . d . × 150 mm , 5 μ m ) was used and the mobile phase was 0.005mol/l sulfuric acid solution (pH 2.5) with flow rate of 1.0ml/min. The detection was conducted with variable wave detector at 210nm at room temperature."
6,Statistics,"2.5 Statistics All experiments were repeated three times. The data shown in the corresponding tables and figures of the Results and Discussion section were the mean values of the experiments, and it was indicated that the relative standard deviations were all within ± 4 % ."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Screening and identification of aciduric hydrogen-producing microorganisms,"3.1 Screening and identification of aciduric hydrogen-producing microorganisms Among the isolated hydrogen-producing microorganisms, a yeast strain HY-35 having a high ability for hydrogen production in an acidic medium was obtained. The yeast cell was 3.6– 7.2 μ m × 3.6 – 7.9 μ m with pseudohypha, and the reproduction mode was budding. The biochemical and physiological experiments were conducted according to the method of Du [9], and the results were summarized in Table 1 . Based on these taxonomic properties, this yeast was considered to be C. maltosa according to the taxonomic methods of Barnett et al. [10] and Rij [11]."
9,The aciduric and hydrogen-producing properties of C. maltosa HY-35,"3.2 The aciduric and hydrogen-producing properties of C. maltosa HY-35 Effects of pH of basal medium on hydrogen production by C. maltosa HY-35 was investigated in a batch culture, as shown in Fig. 1 . Hydrogen yield was measured periodically until termination of gas production. Hydrogen production rate was determined by a slope of the tangent to a hydrogen production curve at the early stage of culture. C. maltosa HY-35 can grow under acidic pH of 1.3, although the optimum pH for cell growth was around 3.0, which indicated that this yeast was an aciduric microorganism. As shown in Fig. 1, hydrogen yield increased with a rise of pH and remained relatively steady at pH of 2.5–5.0. Although the optimum pH range for hydrogen production was 2.5 to 5.0, C. maltosa HY-35 could produce hydrogen even at the acidic pH of 1.3. Hydrogen production rate also increased with a rise of pH and reached the highest value at pH of 3.5. There were few reports on facultative anaerobes which can produce hydrogen at the acidic pH of 4.0–4.5. E. aerogenes strain HO-39, well-known to have aciduric hydrogen-producing properties, hardly produced hydrogen at pH below 4.0 [7]. Acidic pH of 3.8–6.0 was usually suitable to yeast growth, and there were few reports on yeast to grow at pH below 2.0 [12]."
10,Hydrogen production by mixed culture of E. aerogenes W-23 and C. maltosa HY-35,"3.3 Hydrogen production by mixed culture of E. aerogenes W-23 and C. maltosa HY-35 The effects of synergistic process and fermentation conditions on hydrogen production were evaluated using the hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate as indicators. The time profiles of hydrogen production in 2l flask in basal conditions by E. aerogenes W-23, C. maltosa HY-35 or their mixed culture were shown in Fig. 2 (a). The maximum hydrogen yield was 1735ml by mixed culture, which was 17.15% and 119.90% higher than those of the monoculture of E. aerogenes W-23 and C. maltosa HY-35, respectively. Fig. 2(b) showed that the maximum hydrogen production rate reached 261.1ml/l/h at 18h, which was 7.85% and 146.23% higher than those of the monoculture of E. aerogenes W-23 and C. maltosa HY-35, respectively. The downtrend of hydrogen production rate by mixed culture was slow than that of monoculture. The results suggested that there was synergistic effect between these two strains on hydrogen production. The optimization of fermentation conditions for hydrogen production by mixed culture of E. aerogenes W-23 and C. maltosa HY-35 were reported in the following text. Table 2 showed the amounts of the products per 100mmol of consumed glucose measured after 26h of cultivation by monoculture of E. aerogenes W-23, and mixed culture of E. aerogenes W-23 and C. maltosa HY-35. The main metabolites of E. aerogenes W-23 by monoculture were ethanol, acetate, succinate, 2,3-butanediol, butyrate and lactate. Compared to the products amounts by monoculture, the amounts of succinate and lactate decreased, while the neutral ethanol increase by mixed culture. The probable reason for this was that the succinate and lactate produced by E. aerogenes W-23 were consumed by the yeast when mixed culture was conducted. E. aerogenes, as well as C. maltosa can utilize citric acid [8], so the fermentation medium includes proper concentration of sodium citrate. In order to examine if the C. maltosa or/and E. aerogenes could produce hydrogen from citrate, the monoculture and mixed culture were operated in the Medium B free of glucose, and the hydrogen could not produce. It was confirmed that C. maltosa and E. aerogenes produce hydrogen from glucose, not from citrate. The detail mechanism of hydrogen production by the mixed culture was a subject for further investigation."
11,The conditions optimization of hydrogen production by mixed culture,"3.4 The conditions optimization of hydrogen production by mixed culture 3.4.1 Effects of inoculation ratio on hydrogen production The total seed inoculation quantity was selected as 2%, and the effect of ratio of E. aerogenes W-23 to C. maltosa HY-35 in total seed on hydrogen production was shown in Fig. 3 . The results indicated that the ratio has an important effect on hydrogen production. The hydrogen yield increased with a rise of ratio of the bacterium to the yeast, and the highest yield reached 1789ml/l when E. aerogenes W-23 was at a percentage of 65. So 65:35 was selected as the optimum ratio of E. aerogenes W-23 to C. maltosa HY-35 at the total seed inoculation quantity of 2%. 3.4.2 Effects of glucose concentration on hydrogen production In the experiments, glucose was found to be the optimum carbon source than other carbon sources, such as starch, maltose, dextrin and sucrose (data not shown). Fig. 4 (a) and (b) showed that hydrogen yield and cell mass increased with a rise of glucose concentration, and hydrogen yield remained stable when glucose concentration was higher than 11g/l. Hydrogen production rate profile varying with initial glucose concentration was shown in Fig. 4(c). Hydrogen production rate increased with a rise of glucose concentration at the range of 5–11g/l, and it decreased when glucose concentration was higher than 11g/l. Glucose was utilized completely when initial glucose concentration was less than 11g/l, as shown in Fig. 4(e). Glucose utilization rate by mixed culture of E. aerogenes W-23 and C. maltosa HY-35 was higher than that of monoculture (data not shown). 3.4.3 Effects of nitrogen sources on hydrogen production Fig. 5 exhibited the effects of nitrogen sources on hydrogen production and cell growth. The higher hydrogen yield and well cell growth were obtained when peptone and yeast extract were used, respectively, so yeast extract and peptone were selected as the complex nitrogen sources for hydrogen production. Effects of complex nitrogen sources on hydrogen production and cell growth were shown in Fig. 6 , and the hydrogen yield and biomass were higher when complex nitrogen sources was used other than single nitrogen source. The total nitrogen sources concentration at 0.04mol/l (conversion to the concentration of nitrogen element) was more beneficial for hydrogen production and cell growth, and the optimum molar ratio of yeast extract to peptone was 8:2. The suitable complex nitrogen sources content was calculated as follows: yeast extract 3.2g/l and peptone 8g/l. 3.4.4 Effects of inorganic salt on hydrogen production Fig. 7 (a)–(c) showed the effects of FeSO4, NiCl2 and MgCl2 on hydrogen production, respectively. These three inorganic salts can improve the production of hydrogen, and the optimum concentration of FeSO4, NiCl2 and MgCl2 was 50, 9 and 60mg/l, respectively. Our results were in accordance with the conclusion of Gray et al., who observed that hydrogen could not produce without Fe 2 + [13]. The effect of metal on the hydrogen production can be interpreted by the fact that suitable metal content can improve the activity of enzyme, which is responsible for hydrogen production (e.g., Ni, Fe for hydrogenase and Fe for nitrogenase) [1]. The mechanism of positive effect of Mg 2 + on hydrogen production was not clarified. 3.4.5 Effects of initial pH on hydrogen production It is well known that pH has an important effect on hydrogen production [14,15]. In our research, pH was confirmed to be a critical effect factor during fermentative hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 8 . It showed that pH 5.8–6.2 was advantageous to hydrogen production, and initial pH 6.0 was selected as the optimum initial pH. It might be explained that at early stage of mixed culture, hydrogen production was mainly by E. aerogenes W-23, so relatively higher initial pH was beneficial. The results of direct viable counts periodically of E. aerogenes W-23 and C. maltosa HY-35 from the mixed culture broth, respectively, confirmed such hypothesis (data not shown)."
12,Time-course of hydrogen production by mixed culture,"3.5 Time-course of hydrogen production by mixed culture Fig. 9 showed the typical time profiles of hydrogen production in 2l flask in optimum conditions by mixed culture of E. aerogenes W-23 and C. maltosa HY-35. The pH value of the fermentation broth decreased along with the production of hydrogen and reached 3.3 at 20h, which was due to the production of organic acid. Under the optimized conditions, the hydrogen yield approached to the maximum 2074ml/l at 26h, which was 19.54% higher than that of the basal conditions. The concentration of carbon source glucose was used up at about 26h, therefore, it is suggested that the carbon source should be fed to maintain continuous hydrogen production."
13,Conclusions,"An aciduric hydrogen-producing yeast HY-35 exhibiting excellent hydrogen production efficiency was successfully isolated from anaerobic active sludge, and it was identified as C. maltosa. C. maltosa HY-35 can grow and produce hydrogen at pH of 1.3. A mixed culture of C. maltosa HY-35 and E. aerogenes W-23 was conducted, and a higher yield of hydrogen was observed than that of the monoculture by C. maltosa HY-35 or E. aerogenes W-23. The optimum conditions for hydrogen production by mixed culture were investigated. The suitable inoculation percentage of E. aerogenes W-23 in total seeds was 65%. The presence of Fe 2 + , Ni 2 + and Mg 2 + in the culture medium all appeared to be critical to hydrogen production. The performance of hydrogen production was also influenced by the initial pH, glucose concentration and nitrogen source. Hydrogen yield were higher when the mixed culture was conducted at initial pH of 6.0. Hydrogen production was perfect when initial glucose concentration was 11g/l, and the complex nitrogen composed of yeast extract 3.2g/l and peptone 8g/l was advantageous to hydrogen production."
