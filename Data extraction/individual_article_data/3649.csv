0,Introduction,"Due to the incessant growth of population and economy around the globe as well as urbanization and increasing demand for energy in industrialization and transportation sectors, various energy sources such as crude oil are considered a promising candidate for the enhancement and development of human life standard level with an elevated cost, while they are generally affected by global economic activity [1,2]. As hydrocarbon fuels result in considerable environmental pollution, the utilization of eco-friendly and reproducible fuels such as biomass, solar cells, wind power, and hydrogen has attracted considerable attention [3]. On the other hand, widespread fossil fuel consumption results in reservoir depletion and leads to air pollution and its consequences such as ozone depletion, global warming, climate alteration, and human and animal health-related problems as considerable environmental issues [4]. Due to availability and convenient utilization, fossil fuels contribute to almost 65% of global energy demand [5]. Despite a substantial escalation in petroleum price and limited fossil fuels reserves [5], the transport sector generally relies on fossil fuels, and it is reported that greenhouse gases resulting from transportation contribute to almost 28% of emissions in the world, followed by hazardous carbon emissions and climate change [6,7]. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a new policy against finding an alternative to oil and fossil fuels. In this regard, energy consumption reduction and utilization of renewable and sustainable energy have gained considerable attention among academic and industrial authorities. Overall, an ideal replacement should take advantage of being renewable, sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective with a lower emission rate [4]. Alcohols such as ethanol and methanol, hydrogen, compressed and liquefied natural gas, soil and palm oil, propane, and biodiesel are considered promising candidates to substitute oil-based fossil fuels. Besides, several alternative fuel sources, including electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, and algae-based fuels, significantly affect the fuel industry, while they suffer from issues, including the technology of production and distribution phase as well as energy supply [8]. Hydrogen energy is a promising candidate as an energy carrier for fuel cell vehicles and can be produced from renewable sources through nontoxic, non-corrosive, environmentally friendly, and high-efficiency techniques [9]. Overall, fuel cell vehicles operate with insignificant noise and low greenhouse gas emissions [10]. It is expected that hydrogen consumption worldwide is almost 45 million tons per year and will increase soon [11]. Hydrogen, as colourless, odourless, and flammable gas, is known as the most abundant element, and it is generally present in water and organic compounds [12,13]. In a confined space, it is detonable attributed to a wide explosion range, while the possibility of a hydrogen explosion in an open space is significantly reduced because of the rapid diffusion and upwards stems with lower density than air [14]. Hydrogen, as a clean energy carrier, takes advantage of various benefits, including no air pollution, zero-carbon impact in usage, being storable, transportable, and utilizable [15]. Thus, it can be considered for decarbonizing transport, residential, commercial, and industrial sectors [15]. It is generally produced from natural gas (48%), oil (30%), coal (18%), and electrolysis (4%) [16]. In terms of safety, hydrogen is non-toxic and lighter than air, and due to its immediate dissipation, which leads to a rapid fuel dispersal through leakage, is it safer than split fuels [17], while undetected leakage followed by ignition and explosion is a vital concern [18]. Also, it has a wide range (4%–75%) of flammability in air and lower ignition energy of ~0.1 than the gasoline one [19]. In addition to electricity, hydrogen plays a vital role in the low-carbon economy with the ability to produce heat, transport, and power system services [20]. Due to low energy density by volume of hydrogen gas compared with hydrocarbons, large storage tanks are required [21]. Meanwhile, small molecule size leads to escaping through materials, destructive ability results in mechanical degradation and failure followed by leakage [19,22]. Overall, various technical issues such as hydrogen generation, maintenance, transportation, and ignition should be taken into consideration to make hydrogen an alternative energy source [23]. In the case of safe hydrogen storage for mobility and transport applications on a large scale, fuel cell technology is a promising way to utilize renewable and sustainable energy sources [24,25]. A fuel cell efficiently converts chemical energy to electric type with hydrogen as a common energy storage substance and oxygen as an oxidizer in which water is produced as a by-product [26]. It consists of an anode, a cathode pillars, as well as an electrolyte that is located between them [27]. Generally, pure hydrogen is fed to the anode as fuel, while air/pure oxygen enters through the cathode. Electrons are separated on the anode, hydrogen ions pass through the electrolyte, followed by mixing with oxygen atoms on the cathode and producing H2O [28]. The following are the reactions that take place in a hydrogen fuel cell [26,29]: (1) A n o d e : H 2 ( g ) → 2 H ( e q ) + + 2 e − (2) C a t h o d e : 1 2 O 2 ( g ) + 2 H ( e q ) + + 2 e − → H 2 O ( e q ) It is predicted that in the near future, hydrogen will be widely used in transportation and industry as a fuel [11]. The hydrogen fuel cell is considered an eco-friendly technology with high energy efficiency and an alternative to internal combustion engines [30] (Fig. 1 ). Also, they can be used as power sources in automotive and as a backup for generators and small power plants [31]. In terms of transportation, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are promising candidates because of the emission of no carbon dioxide [32]. Meanwhile, for the adequate driving range, low energy-density results in difficult enough hydrogen storage in a small and lightweight vessel. Generally, hydrogen storage techniques are summarized as following [27]: • Pressurized tank storage • Metal-based compounds • Cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage Despite the importance of future energy supplies, safety concerns against hydrogen leakage from a damaged vehicle are vital [32]. In tandem with this, to prevent the explosion risk, hydrogen applications must be monitored according to the following criteria [31]: • No response delay time and sensitivity against water vapor should be detected for the hydrogen sensor devised in the anode loop. • Fuel oxidant outlet emissions should be controlled to prevent the explosion. • Ventilation areas in hydrogen fuels cell should be monitored to trace hydrogen leakage [33]. • The 0–4% H2 should be accurately detected without any sensitivity to other gases. • In terms of hydrogen sensor utilization, the main requirement is to hold up 100% condensing humidity, immediately reach ambient temperature, and keep operating at temperatures below ambient. Fast response time and operation in a wide range of temperatures (-40-400 °C) is also of considerable importance. • In terms of solid-state sensors, water resistance is a vital property. • In terms of passengers' safety, hydrogen leakage should be promptly detected and monitored. Most of the aforementioned risk mitigative measures confirm the significance of the sensing and monitoring techniques in the field of hydrogen applications. In safety terms, various issues, including hydrogen permeation, embrittlement, leakage, ignition, and explosion, have been taken into consideration [31]. Meanwhile, it is depicted that hydrogen leakage monitoring is vital for the evaluation of accident prevention and the determination of safety guidelines and standards [31]. However, it is depicted that widespread utilization of fuel cell vehicles has been limited due to on-board hydrogen storage challenges such as finding a proper vessel that meets requirements, appropriate storage methods, and refuelling procedure [34]. Overall, safe, high-quality, and efficient hydrogen infrastructure is vital for widespread hydrogen usage in the consumer sector (Fig. 1) [35]. In terms of hydrogen usage as a fuel in hydrogen infrastructures and vehicles, safe development should be considered. To this end, the installation of sensors to detect and monitor unexpected hazards, such as leakage, is an essential element of hydrogen safety [36]. So, this paper focuses on the utilization of hydrogen as an alternative fuel in fuel cell vehicles. This will begin with a brief description of hydrogen characteristics and safety issues with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, including safety in usage and refuelling as well as the introduction of hydrogen storage systems. Subsequently, different techniques applicable to risk analysis of hydrogen storage and fuel cell applications and the monitoring requirements, including regulations, codes, and standards, will be discussed. Sensor types and performance will be considered next, followed by prospects of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles."
1,Safety issues with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles,"The utilization of cleaner fuels and drivetrain technologies in motor vehicles has been considered a promising technology to protect the environment through petroleum usage and subsequent noxious tailpipe emissions reduction [37]. Although hydrogen generally is stored in the gaseous, liquid, and solid-state, compressed gas storage with high pressure (35 or 70 MPa) is considered the most efficient way for transportation attributed to its technical simplicity, promising reliability, elevated energy efficiency, and availability [34,38]. Despite the advantages, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles face several weaknesses, including limited range, storage and safety issues, high cost, and less popularity [39]. On the other hand, refuelling with high-pressure hydrogen usually results in an instant increase in storage cylinder inner temperature, decreasing the state of charge (SOC), damage of vessel walls, and safety challenges [34]. Also, as hydrogen is an odourless and colourless gas, it is indispensable to design sensors that can sufficiently detect leaks [40]. Besides, due to flammability and low ignition energy [41], it has not been considered a popular fuel. But, it has been widely used in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles around the globe and especially in Korea [3]. Also, low gravimetric and volumetric densities of hydrogen fuel are considered shortcomings of fuel cells [42]. In terms of the utilization of hydrogen as fuel in vehicles, the safety issues in usage should be monitored accurately to evaluate and plummet the possible hazards. Overall, due to a separated energy source and converter, a fuel cell system is relatively complex; thus, the assessment of safety and reliability issues is vital for portable applications [43]."
2,Safety in usage,"2.1 Safety in usage Generally, hydrogen is not an explosive and reactive substance, and a reactant agent is always required [44]. Table 1 depicts some of the hydrogen-combustion characteristics compared to other conventional gases [45]. Hydrogen is 14 times lighter than air, and due to its low density, it is buoyant and safer than other fuels in an open atmosphere followed by immediate dispersion in a ventilated area and releasing less energy during the explosion [40]. Due to the buoyancy, hydrogen would immediately disperse in an open area to below its flammability limit, while in a given volume, hydrogen explosion releases less energy compared to other fuels such as gasoline and natural gas [46]. Moreover, hydrogen severely interacts with various surfaces, shows high solubility, and simply diffuses through almost all materials at ambient temperature [47]. In terms of non-metals, hydrogen can diffuse as a molecule and results in non-reversible damage in elastomers during supersaturation [48]. Besides, hydrogen dissociates on metal surfaces followed by diffusion into metal as a single atom. As a fuel, various properties (ductility, fracture, and fatigue) of materials used to handle and deliver gaseous hydrogen would degrade through hydrogen exposure [47]. Also, hydrogen leaks faster than other gases and would detonate in case of mixing with air in certain circumstances [19]. Hence, safety considerations are essential to avoid hydrogen escape. From an engineering point of view, suitable materials used in hydrogen service should take advantage of properties related to the following criteria [47]: • Material parameters: strength and microstructure • Mechanical parameters: integrity of the structure including static and fatigue stresses amount in addition to size, distribution, and structural defects congestion • Environmental parameters: pressure, ignition (induction) time (a common measure of the ignitability of a mixture) [49], temperature, and gas purity In terms of the transportation of gaseous hydrogen, standard transportable gas vessels are generally fabricated from Cr–Mo steel. Although the growth rate of the fatigue crack for Cr–Mo steels is escalated under special loading conditions compared with rates air, they are considered an efficient candidate for high-pressure hydrogen applications [50,51]. For steel pipelines, fracture resistance declines while the fatigue crack growth rate soars into a gaseous hydrogen environment [52]. 2.1.1 Flammability The flammability of hydrogen is considered the most danger-related property compared to its other chemical or physiological properties [44]. Generally, hydrogen flammability is attributed to the energy carrier characteristic, and it is verified that a mixture of flammable gases with air would explode in sufficient concentration and energy required for reaction initiation [44]. According to Table 1, the minimum ignition energy for hydrogen is lower than that of others. Also, it can be seen that a weak spark would ignite any gas/air mixture, and a fire could be started easily [19,44]. Due to the significantly broad flammability range compared to other fuels, hydrogen ignites much easier, and transition to detonation happens more readily [49]. Meanwhile, the wide flammability of hydrogen compared to diesel, gasoline, and methane results in the application of lean-burn combustion strategies with hydrogen as a fuel [11]. It is declared that the most significant drawback of hydrogen usage is low initiative energy as well as a wide flammability range, which causes early ignition of hydrogen mixture [53]. Thus, regarding hydrogen consumption in the fuel cell, care must be taken because hydrogen burns with an invisible flame during ignition [19]. 2.1.2 Leakage due to small molecules Hydrogen is the smallest and lightest atom [19,44] and it can easily leak from sealing regions, including valves and flanges [54]. Therefore, safety aspects should be taken into consideration in terms of hydrogen usage in fuel cells. Due to their small size, hydrogen molecules can either diffuse into materials impermeable to other gases or dissociate on the surface [19]. It is depicted that the diffusion of atomic hydrogen into material would weaken its mechanical integrity and internal blisters result in crack promotion [19]. Also, low viscosity and small molecules necessitate a gasket of fuel tanks [11]. Hydrogen with the unique nature (high pressures and its small molecules) severely weakens most materials [55]. In terms of carbonaceous metals, entrapped methane bubbles generated by hydrogen and carbon reaction cause fissures, cracks, or blisters in the steel due to gas pressure in internal voids through ‘hydrogen embrittlement’ phenomena [19]. Nowadays, it is depicted that chromium-rich steels, chromium-molybdenum alloys, and composite reinforced plastics resist against hydrogen embrittlement [19]."
3,Safety in refuelling,"2.2 Safety in refuelling Safe and fast refuelling is one of the significant challenges of the large-scale application of fuel cell vehicles [34]. Gas temperature rise through high-pressure refuelling leads to a failure in the storage tank [56]. Apart from that, hydrogen density would decrease through temperature escalation and results in final mass delivery reduction followed by driving range decline, while cooling the gas before injection can be a promising method to meet safety requirements [34]. Hence, GTR-HFCV, SAE-J2579, and ISO-15869 have limited the maximum temperature of the wall inside the hydrogen tank and fueling pressure to <358 K and <125% of determined pressure, respectively [34]. Also, it is reported that the initial pressure in the cylinder significantly affects temperature [34]. More hydrogen is typically stored in a tank at higher pressures, and the lower ratio between final and initial pressures decline temperature rise through refuelling [57]. On the other hand, an increase in the filling rate results in final temperature escalation [58]. Three main thermodynamic phenomena, including heat generation by the kinetic energy of the fast-flowing hydrogen converted into the internal energy gas, hydrogen expanding through a throttling valve (Joule-Thomson effect), and compression of hydrogen in the tank through filling, cause an increase in temperature [59]. Overall, temperature raise reduces the state of charge (SOC) of the vessel which causes safety hazards [34]. So, fast charging should be considered seriously to reduce related risks. To this end, multi-stage filling combined with pre-cooling has been recently utilized to decrease temperature rise [34]. In terms of cylinder dimension, it is illustrated that large length/diameter results in local temperature aggravation [9]. Considering the ambient temperature, it is inferred that less heat release at high temperatures [57]. Especially, maximum temperature exceeds safety limits when the temperature of initial gas and wall elevates [34]. So, to ensure safety, fueling parameters including initial gas temperature and pressure, ambient temperature, filling rate, and vessel's dimension should be well monitored [34]. Also, there are outstanding hazards related to hydrogen storage at high pressures [19]. So, a leak from a cylinder results in considerable forces through gas release followed by the infliction of significant damages as well as vessel fracture which is accompanied by auto-ignition of released hydrogen in the atmosphere and fire [19]. In tandem with this, it is verified that liquid hydrogen storing is the only method for substantial hydrogen quantities storage [19]. After filling the tank with liquid hydrogen and when fuel is being withdrawn, air must not penetrate the system due to the formation of an explosive mixture [19]. In terms of hydrogen fueling stations, which are considered essential elements for the operation of fuel cell vehicles [60], there are two safety issues, including elevated hydrogen pressure and the probability of explosion and fire attributed to hydrogen properties (such as low density which results in leakage, vast flammability range, low minimum ignition energy, and hydrogen embrittlement) [61]. A case study in Japan, using data reported in the High-Pressure Gas Safety Act Database, resulted in incidents analysis through the classification method, which is considered as an efficient method with the ability to categorize causes of incidents such as material damage, sealing parts problems, human errors, etc. [60,61]. However, due to regulatory differences in hydrogen fueling stations situated in different areas and the difficulty of comparing accidents, there is no consistency in the evaluation of hydrogen fueling stations around the globe [60]. Sakamoto et al. [60], investigated common causes of incidents and accidents related to hydrogen fueling stations using damages involving Japan and the USA stations available in the High-Pressure Gas Safety Act Database and HIRD. Also, referred to the incident response manual of the High-Pressure Gas Safety Act, they classified the incidents and accidents into six categories as follow [60]: • Type I: Leakage attributed to damages and fractures of bodies apparatuses and pipes such as welded parts • Type II: leakage from flanges valves and seals • Type III: Leakage related to miscellaneous factors such as human error or external impact • Explosion and fire • Burst and fracture According to the results, the main causes of Type I, Type II, and Type III were design error, screw joints, and human error, respectively. Kuroki et al. [62], developed a dynamic simulation method to evaluate optimal hydrogen refuelling technique through the simulation of a transient temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate of hydrogen circulates inside filling apparatus during refuelling. According to the results, good accordance was obtained between simulated values and corresponding experimental data. 2.2.1 Hydrogen storage systems The storage vessel is considered the critical technology for widespread utilization of compressed hydrogen [34], and the most prevalent methods to store hydrogen are compressed hydrogen storage, a cryogenic liquid, and metal hydride [63]. To this end, materials used in vessels should be safe, reliable, cost-effective, and without any strong interaction or reaction with hydrogen [34]. According to Table 2 , hydrogen vessels are generally categorized into four types [34,64]. Generally, hydrogen cylinders are pressurized up to 25, 35, or 70 MPa, while 70 MPa is the most economical pressure for onboard storage related to the driving range and limited space in vehicles [65]. Also, it is reported that Type III and IV are suitable for use in the fuel cell vehicle industry, whereas the other types cannot be deployed in vehicles due to low hydrogen storage density and hydrogen embrittlement drawback [66]. However, early failure and permeation problems are appeared for type III and IV, respectively, through their subjection to cyclic pressures [67]. Among various physical/chemical hydrogen storage techniques (including high-pressure hydrogen storage, metal solid hydrogen storage, and complex hydride hydrogen storage), high-pressure hydrogen storage is the most common method attributed to low-cost, maturity, and feasibility [69]. Composite high-pressure hydrogen storage vessels categorized in type III and IV consist of a liner as well as a carbon fiber wound layer, which acts as a barrier between hydrogen and the composite layer to avoid leakage from micro-cracks and provision of stiffness and strength, respectively [70]. Charging and discharging cause various mechanical stresses to the structure. For instance, burst, fiber damage, and fatigue life are investigated failures of type III, while type IV vessels are usually subjected to collapse and blistering of the liner, burst, and damage [71]. In type III failure terms, progressive failure analysis models composed of explicit finite element method, noninteractive micromechanical failure (MMF) theory, etc. are mainly utilized. Besides, various researches about type IV vessel failure have focused on establishing and verifying burst pressure prediction models as well as damage state identification [71]. Nowadays, type IV vessels are considered promising candidates for compressed hydrogen storage to be utilized for broad applications [72]. Sapre et al. [72] evaluated the mechanical and thermal response of a vessel type IV made from carbon fiber/epoxy composite with high-density polyethylene liner at various refuelling conditions. Results depicted that the tank presented excellent resistance to fatigue and corrosion. Moreover, it was verified that failure at various pressures up to maximum was restricted by the high tensile and compressive strength of high-density polyethylene. Halm et al. [21] proposed that the type IV composite pressure vessel may burst in fire conditions due to the degradation of the outer layer, while the leak is observed when inner pressure is lower than a critical value which stems from heat transfer through the composite shell and liner melting. To this end, a pressure vessel was subjected to fire as a representative of an accidental situation. In practice, compressed-hydrogen vessels used in vehicles are subjected to fatigue through repeated filling and consumption processes [73]. Pressure tanks are exposed to extreme pressure and temperature. Typically, the temperature is escalated through the filling process, followed by a decrease during gas consumption. So, the thermal fluctuation leads to severe thermal stress stems from a mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficient of adjacent plies with different fiber orientations along with internal pressure, which results in lamination damage in the form of micro-cracks in the resin, and then lead to the composite material failure [34]. Also, temperature alteration influences the mechanical characteristics of epoxy resin and carbon fibers by decreasing fracture toughness at low temperatures and interlaminar shear strength of the composites at high temperatures [74]. After an accident, hydrogen leakage is considered the most severe problem [32]. It has been illustrated that the hydrogen concentration leaked through an accident reaches up to >4% mole fraction in the air (considered as flammability limit) and results in serious explosion hazards [32]. In terms of continuous hydrogen leakage, immediate ignition would occur followed by the formation of a jet flame, and when it hits obstacles or agglomerates in a restricted volume, a flammable gas cloud can be made [14]. Once there is an ignition source in the flammable gas, the explosion would happen, and overpressure harms people and equipment [35]. Generally, hydrogen release from high-pressure gaseous storage vessels occurs when a heat source, which acts as an ignition source that burns the released gas and forms a jet flame, exists and starts the thermal pressure relief device (TPRD) [75]. Hence, hydrogen concentration should be reduced to certify the safety of drivers and passengers [32]. Overall, several experiments have been performed to investigate the physics of hydrogen leaks and effective factors and models and methods devised to diminish hydrogen concentration around a leak [32]. Li et al. [16] established a diffusion model of high-pressure hydrogen leakage in a fuel cell ship using the component transportation and chemical reaction modules. Using transient numerical simulations of hydrogen leakage, hydrogen concentration distribution after the leakage was obtained. Besides, various ventilation conditions which efficiently affect hydrogen diffusion trend were considered, and the optimum locations of hydrogen sensors and ventilation system were predicted. Results depicted that in terms of natural ventilation, the hydrogen concentration in the cabin would surge rapidly. At the same time, it would decline to 4% and 0 in control and passengers’ cabin, respectively, for positive ventilation. After leakage, the walls and corners of the fuel cell cabin would immediately be filled with hydrogen. Also, vents in the passenger cabin would increase the accumulated concentration of hydrogen. The best way to avoid hydrogen accumulation would be devising a mechanical vent in the fuel cell cabin. It is believed that the evaluation of hydrogen safety using experimental procedures is not economical and safe related to dangerous nature and costly experimental procedures [40]. Thus, simulation tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are considered an efficient alternative method. Dadashzadeh et al. [40] used the CFD to predict hydrogen gas behaviour after an accidental release. This study reveals the CFD application in presenting the hydrogen concentration profile considering various effective parameters such as ventilation, obstacle configurations, and ignition sources. According to results, a combination of mechanical and natural ventilation (such as opening windows and using fans in the compartment) led to a 93% decrease of fuel inside the compartment. In terms of the rescue of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles accidents, Yu et al. [76] simulated various scenarios with accidental leakage, including the opened sunroof, opened door windows, opened sunroof and door windows, and the opened sunroof, door windows, and rear windshield using CFD tools including pseudo-source approach, velocity, and concentration decay validation, physical and numerical models. Also, according to the ambient wind's effect, they evaluated hydrogen concentration inside the vehicle and the distribution of flammable areas. It was verified that hydrogen distribution inside the vehicle would be strongly affected by ambient wind speed during the convection process between outside and inside of the vehicle through hydrogen mole fraction reduction to <4%. Malakhov et al. [77] utilized CFD to evaluate hydrogen leakage in a semi-closed ventilation instrument by applying numerical simulations, verifying hydrogen distribution, and comparing simulation results with experimental data. Results depicted that performed simulations were applicable to the development of mitigation strategies for hydrogen safety issues. Kobayashi et al. [78] performed experiments on cryo-compressed hydrogen leakage diffusion to enhance safety regulations for fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen infrastructures. Results delineated that the hydrogen leakage flow rate increased by decreasing the supply temperature. Also, a decrease in hydrogen injection temperature resulted in hydrogen concentration enhancement. Hussein et al. [79] investigated unignited hydrogen release and dispersion from 700 bar onboard vessels in a covered car park with natural ventilation using CFD. According to the results, a constant mass flow rate release led to the formation of a larger flammable cloud in the car park compared to blowdown release from the same Thermally Activated Pressure Relief Devices (TPRD). Also, it was depicted that smaller flammable clouds were produced by TPRD with a smaller diameter. Thus, the diameter should be reduced as much as possible. Besides, a downward release contributed to the formation of a larger flammable envelope near doors and rear. But, the average hydrogen concentration in the flammable cloud was lower than the cloud appearing through upward release. On the other hand, a greater flammable envelope was formed beneath the ceiling in the upward release. Hussein et al. [80] evaluated overpressures resulting from an immediate ignited release of hydrogen in space. Results delineated a complex relation between vent size and release rate as well as the significant overpressures caused by pressure peaking following an ignited release in space. Also, they declared which are currently utilized in hydrogen-powered vehicles can lead to a dangerous situation unless the TPRD diameter decreases to mm. It was depicted that the reduction of the TPRD diameter results in the reduction of overpressure and duration of pressure peak. A previous study proposed that pressure peaking phenomena resulted from a release from hydrogen storage through a TPRD in a confined space [81]. They inferred that the resultant overpressure would destroy the garage in a fraction of a second. Makarov et al. [82] evaluated the main unresolved safety issue related to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, such as fire resistance of onboard hydrogen storage. Also, the fire-resistance rating of high-pressure hydrogen vessels was calculated through numerical analysis. It was verified that the fire-resistance rating of the carbon-fibre plastic tank was enhanced using epoxy-based intumescent paint as thermal protection solution. Thus, increasing fire resistance rating significantly affect the safety design of vessels as well as range of hazards in case of accidents such as fire. Hydrogen with the highest energy content by weight can be stored in either small or large amounts through various methods. Generally, hydrogen storage is considered a vital factor in hydrogen energy systems, and it can be categorized into two groups, including stationary and mobile applications. Due to low energy density (9.9 MJ/m3) [83], hydrogen storage requires large storage vessels. Several features include high storage pressure, low storage temperature, and the materials attracting larger amounts of hydrogen to meet large vessel requirements [84]. Generally, hydrogen storage technologies are categorized into physical-based and material-based groups [84]. The former consists of hydrogen storage compressed gas, cold/cryo compressed, and liquid hydrogen. The latter is comprised of chemical sorption/chemisorption and physical sorption [85]. Compressed hydrogen storage includes four types of vessels: a fully metallic pressure tank, a steel pressure tank with a glass fiber composite, a full composite wrap with a metal liner, and a composite [63]. Liquid/cryogenic hydrogen storage is considered the most common method for large-scale storage and delivery. A cryogenic tanker would carry 5000 kg hydrogen (equals five times the compressed hydrogen gas tube trailer) [84]. Due to high storage density, fast and efficient refuelling, and a vacuum enclosure, cryo-compressed hydrogen (supercritical cryogenic gas) storage is a promising method for storage and safety levels [84,86]. It is proposed that the ideal storage is determined through qualifying/quantifying the system characteristics [87]. More detailed information can be found on [84,87]."
4,Quantitative risk assessment (QRA),"2.3 Quantitative risk assessment (QRA) A combination of frequency and consequence of an accident is called risk analysis. Risk mitigation strategies are defined by decreasing the likelihood of failure and/or the associated consequences [3]. Active and passive systems are usually utilized for protection from potential impacts of hydrogen release. Passive safety systems are utilized in various applications, such as building structures. At the same time, various pieces of equipment that measure material concentration are applied in active safety systems [3]. Generally, QRA is known as an essential technique for feasibility analysis and safety assessment of hydrogen applications in transportation systems. Using this technique, engineering models and data lead to developing the codes and standards, in addition to providing facile design and permitting process for hydrogen fueling stations. In terms of hydrogen safety, fundamental scientific theories should be translated into practical and user-friendly tools. Overall, QRA methods take advantage of probabilistic and physical models to evaluate likelihoods and effects of release and ignition related scenarios which result in thermal and overpressure hazards [47]. Hydrogen leakage leads to the subsequent ignition. Exposure to thermal effects from jet fires and deflagrations as well as exposure to overpressures from deflagrations and detonations are considered as the main hazards affecting human health, assets, structures, and the environment. Also, the physical effect of hazards is typically characterized using various models with data linkage [47]. Despite the applicability of QRA methods to hydrogen systems, their widespread utilization for code revisions has been limited due to various gaps in data and available models to achieve the final QRA [47,88]. Although it is at a very early stage compared to many other processes such as the oil and gas industry, the risk assessment and management frameworks have been established by different researchers to investigate the impacts of hydrogen release in various accident scenarios. Liu and Christopher [32] investigate the utilization of a portable blower devised to disperse hydrogen around a leaking vehicle. It was also illustrated that a ground effect blower equipped with a diffuser flush to the floor effectively removes hydrogen to form a safety envelope around the vehicle. To assess a method to rescue people safely according to the sound of hydrogen leakage, Maeda and Tamura [89] evaluated the properties of hydrogen leakage sound stems from a hydrogen leaking vehicle according to noise at the crossing with much traffic. It was verified that hydrogen leakage sound shows directivity as well as height and distance dependence. Dadashzadeh et al. [90] utilized a quantitative risk assessment related to the onboard hydrogen-powered vehicle tank which is exposed to fire. Hazard distances were measured using validated engineering tools for blast wave and fireball. Besides, to monitor fire and prevent tank rupture, a vulnerability probit function was performed to measure the probability of emergency operations’ failure. It was declared that the assumed thermally unprotected composite vessel was prone to the human life risk lost in an accident resulting in a fire and vessel rupture. 2.3.1 QRA methodology and tools Hydrogen QRAs, generally consist of an identical series of modelling steps depicted in (Fig. 2 ) with critical differences in models and data gathering and utilization in each step [47]. According to the previous studies, traditional QRA techniques such as Event Trees, Fault Trees, parts counts, etc. [47,91] and more advanced QRA techniques such as Bayesian Networks are commonly utilized [92] to simulate scenarios and root causes of accidents. Moreover, diverse reduced-order models, as well as CFD ones, have been applied to estimate the consequences [47]. In tandem with this, fast-running behaviour models such as dynamic probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) have resulted in the emergence of advanced QRA methods such as Event Sequence Diagrams [93], Discrete Dynamic Event Trees in addition to sampling and simulation-based QRA and PSA models [94,95]. Various international research institutions, including Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), streamlined and standardized the methodologies applicable for hydrogen QRA through developing the software tools to make access to state-of-the-art models more convenient [47,96]. For instance, Hydrogen Risk Assessment Models (HyRAM) [97] are developed as a QRA tool to assess the risk for defensible and science-based codes and standards by SNL [98]. Using HyRAM, relevant behaviour models and probabilistic models are integrated into an individual analysis framework that results in access to state-of-the-art models and a framework required for risk assessment of hydrogen transportation infrastructure [47]. Therefore, industry experts such as codes and standard developers, as well as station designers, take advantage of this tool in terms of fast running and high-level insights [47]. Overall, the expertise of the international hydrogen safety research community collected using HyRAM tool (includes generic hydrogen data, behavior models, and harm models for thermal and pressure effects as well as molecular configuration for adopting additional hazard models) can be considered a great way to guarantee the safety of the hydrogen industry [47]. Besides, hydrogen-specific behaviour and probabilistic models/data for the QRA approach are combined using HyRAM by incorporating the traditional QRA technique with embedded simulation [47]. Gye et al. [3] presented a high-pressure hydrogen refuelling station QRA in an urban area. According to the results, leaks emitted from the tube-trailer and dispenser, in addition to the potential explosion of the tube-trailer, are considered as the main contributors to the risk. It was proposed that implementing an additional safety barrier system on the compressor and dispenser to prevent the continuous release of hydrogen during accidents is required. Low probability and significant consequences of the scenarios lead to unacceptable results of the applied QRA method, such as consequence and frequency analysis. So, mitigation and safety barrier systems, including detectors such as Emergency Detection System (EDS) were utilized, leading to an immediate shutdown and decreasing the frequency and amount of hydrogen leakage from equipment. Liang et al. [14] used FLACS software based on the computational fluid dynamics method to simulate and analyze the hydrogen storage system's leakage and explosion in a renewable hydrogen refuelling station. Also, they evaluated the effect of wind speed/direction and leakage direction on the consequence of accidents. Results inferred that leakage accident of the 90 MPa hydrogen storage vessel results in the biggest harm in a hydrogen explosion. Also, 35.7 m and 18.8 m are considered the farthest harmful distance originated from the explosion and the farthest lethal distance, respectively in case of the same wind and leakage direction. Besides, in terms of sufficient amount of hydrogen, they proposed that the hydrogen tube trailer ought not to be parked in the hydrogen refuelling station. In quantitative risk assessment terms, reported studies combined the likelihood of leakage in different equipment, ignition probability, and accidents impacts hazard [99]. 2.3.1.1 Probability data and models Accident scenarios and root causes related to hydrogen releases are simulated using probabilistic models and data [47]. Besides, a study about the ignition probability of a released flow has been recently considered, and it is depicted that usual ignition probability models are look-up tables, assigning immediate and delayed ignition probability as a function of hydrogen release rate [100]. Meanwhile, physical modelling would improve ignition modelling [101]. 2.3.1.2 Consequence and harm models Generally, behaviour models would enable quantification of hazards and consequences, and they are efficient for evaluating risks associated with a specific scenario [47]. To this end, considerable progress has been made in fast-running behaviour models such as plume/jet model, flame model, and overpressure models, which can form functional consequence models required for modelling detonations as well as jet fires and deflagrations as primary hazards of hydrogen systems [47]. Also, it is reported that harm models and criteria or thermal and overpressure events as main damaging physical impacts of hydrogen have been established [47]. LaChance et al. [102] proposed that specific, deterministic harm criteria and probit functions that regress the harm probability against a physical effect magnitude are the most prevalent models. Overall, thermal impacts stem from radiative heat flux of flames, including jet fire and deflagrations, are addressed using these models, and thermal effects resulting from conduction are presumed to result in maximum harm [47]. Also, harms attributed to overpressure effects are usually modelled as a function of peak overpressure a swell as impulse originated from a deflagration or detonation [47]. Overall, according to the literature, it is conspicuous that various studies have been concentrated on the assessment of the risk and safety of hydrogen stations, including quantitative methods [99], qualitative methods [54,103], integrated techniques [94,104], and safety distance of hydrogen refuelling stations [105]. In terms of failure prediction and analysis, crucial parameters, including burst pressure, damage state, and fatigue lifetime, are considered for vessels’ failure analysis [71]."
5,Hydrogen monitoring requirements in different regulations,"Nowadays, the world deals with energy and environmental crises due to the shortage of conventional energy resources like fossil fuels and the greenhouse effect, spelling disaster for the environment. To remedy this issue, introducing new alternative fuels seems to be more necessary and vital than ever. Among different alternatives, hydrogen is considered one of the most promising ones [106]. Employing hydrogen as a successful fuel requires the development of hydrogen infrastructure and vehicle safety [107]. Using sensors for detecting and monitoring hydrogen release is an effective element for a hydrogen safety system. Undoubtedly, like any other technology, the development of international and national regulations and standards for risk assessments is a vital requirement for hydrogen-fuelled vehicles. Accordingly, different laws and regulations have been imposed in most countries to address the safety and palatable performance of commercial products in the system by meeting all applicable codes and standards [108]. In this section regulations and safety standards in hydrogen monitoring will be reviewed."
6,Hydrogen sensor requirements,"3.1 Hydrogen sensor requirements Regarding the increasing use of hydrogen in the hydrogen economy, generic requirements for hydrogen detectors need to be identified. Hydrogen detectors can be applied to sense release and shut down systems automatically, make alarms and ventilation systems activated, and warn emergency responders. Using hydrogen sensors in the atmosphere, which have the potential to explode, must comply with proper regulations, codes, and standards, establishing essential health issues and safety requirements. Moreover, the application of sensors in those areas requires the consideration of the three main facets in terms of requirements and standards: • The sensor needs to be protected against explosion, based on the series of standards IEC60079. • The hydrogen sensor must meet performance requirements to monitor hydrogen as flammable gas, according to IEC 60079-29-1:2007 and ISO 26142:2010. • Hydrogen sensors should be in compliance with performance safety as it is generally stated in the series of standards IEC 61508 for electrical, electronic, and programmable electronic safety-related systems. Briefly, based on the final application of hydrogen (hydrogen production, storage, and transportation), four essential factors must be noted: • Performance: Sensors must be applicable to different environments including air, nitrogen, and inert atmospheres, and be sensitive under the lower explosion limit (LEL), 4% H2, in air. Besides characteristics related to the chemical parts of sensors, physical features have to be also noted. In this regard, T90 is a variable to be considered, in addition to temperature, pressure, and the ambient humidity range based on the application of sensors. • Lifetime: It is another parameter identified based on a particular application of the sensor. Generally, based on the application, the range of hydrogen sensors lifetime can be established as less than 10 years for stationary power systems, 3–5 years in industrial processes, and more than 10 years for transportation purposes (15 years for hydrogen safety sensors would be preferable for automobile manufacturers which are out of reach today). In this period, sensors should be operational without the need for replacement, cleaning, or persistent calibration. • Reliability: to be reliable, false alarms should be prevented to ensure the stability and safety of hydrogen usage. Moreover, responses must be accurate and sensitive. Sensors should be functional in high hydrogen concentrations regardless of their integrity, and their evaluations must be approved and certified based on international standards. • Cost: Sensors need to be cost-efficient in terms of purchase, installation, and maintenance. In general, costs are related to applied technologies and expectedly, as new developments are being achieved, the ratio of cost/technology changes constantly."
7,"Regulations, codes, and standards","3.2 Regulations, codes, and standards For better understanding, we must be aware of the differences between the concept and the importance of Regulations, Codes, and Standards. Briefly, A standard is composed of technical definitions and guidelines functioning as directions for either designers/producers or operators/users of the equipment. These instructions are not mandatory, while codes are enforceable by law and are defined as a set of regulations or rules adopted by one or more governments. Finally, a regulation is a rule coping with procedure details or instructions issued by the government and imposed by law; regulations are typically safety-oriented [109]. The hydrogen community aims to provide vital information for codes in recent code cycles and educate the industry. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes and the International Code Council have been coordinated, leading to the provision of selected numbers of codes dealing with hydrogen to remove conflicting requirements in the two documents. NFPA 2, the Hydrogen Technologies Code, is one of the two basic documents to maintain hydrogen facilities, which is involved in general requirements for fire Safety and hydrogen requirements. The other document, the International Fire Code (IFC), has been harmonized for hydrogen usage. However, NFPA 1 is preferable in some states and jurisdictions, which points to NFPA 2 instead of the IFC. Many governments and local authorities have their codes or modified codes in addition to the mentioned documents. When it comes to confirming a plan, although all of these documents offer valid and safe infrastructure design methods, finally, the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) is the organization that approves and enforces codes. H2tools.org provides a thorough list of all codes & standards related to hydrogen infrastructure [110]. The NFPA 2 Hydrogen Technologies Code, the NFPA 853 Standard for Fuel Cell Energy Systems, is considered another critical document in hydrogen technology. At the next level, these documents contain references to component standards that are enforceable. Moreover, using hydrogen safety sensors in hydrogen fueling operations is mandatory in the National Fire Protection Associations and Vehicular Fuel Systems Code [111]. However, NFPA 52 code has no specifications for sensor performances or deployment parameters. In terms of addressing the performance of hydrogen sensors, many codes and standards have been presented by various national [112] and international [113] Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs). The requirements recommended by these national and international standards are far more comprehensive, which covers a broader specification range of hydrogen detectors in terms of analytical and deployment targets compared to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) specifications."
8,"International collaborations and formal agreements (DOE, NREL, JRC, and FCH-JU)","3.3 International collaborations and formal agreements (DOE, NREL, JRC, and FCH-JU) Different organizations and committees are collaborating globally to address the safety issues of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. To use hydrogen as a beneficial fuel, the development of safety issues of a hydrogen infrastructure is necessary. Generally, sensors perform a vital role in the hydrogen safety system due to the detection and monitoring of unexpected hydrogen release. In this regard, to support the development and usage of hydrogen sensors, different organizations have established sensor test facilities independently. The two main superior organizations involved in hydrogen sensor research are the European Joint Research Centre (JRC) at the Institute for Energy and Transport in the Netherlands [114] and the Safety Codes and Standards Sub-Program Office within the Department of Energy and Fuel Cell Technologies Office (DOE-FCTO) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the U.S [115]. Each facility aims to ensure stakeholders' needs. The sensor laboratories endorse hydrogen consumption through direct cooperation with the hydrogen community and the following activities: • Supporting sensor developers and producers for the independent verification of sensor performances [116]. • Helping end-users (stationary and vehicular) through the selection, qualification, and implementation of the sensor [117]. Sensors might be selected according to the requirements of the specific applications. • Dealing with hydrogen safety panels, and code and standards development organizations. In this regard, document development [118], pre-normative research [119], verification technology [36], and expert guidance have been performed to support this activity. • Making an effort to inform and educate the hydrogen community about the appropriate usage of hydrogen sensors. With relatively the same goal, the NREL and JRC sensor laboratories have been working collaboratively since 2008. This collaboration was made official under a Memorandum of Agreement signed in 2010 to provide facilities for sensor tests to guarantee, firstly, the availability of required hydrogen sensors for hydrogen infrastructure and secondly, the education of the hydrogen community to use the sensors appropriately [120]. Furthermore, DOE FCTO and the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH-JU) of the European Commission later reached a formal international agreement in which their collaboration activities on hydrogen sensor research programs began to analyze gaps of hydrogen technologies and to facilitate the availability of efficient and budget-friendly sensors. The European engaged in an action under the auspices of H2Sense, which is the European sensor consortium for producers and research laboratories funded by FCH-JU [121]. The NREL Sensor Test Laboratory led the U.S. side. These days, the NREL-JRC sensor collaborative activity is under the auspices of the program-level agreement between the DOE and the JRC, which has been recently implemented to encourage energy research and development [122]. This collaboration was planned to conduct hydrogen sensor research and determine gaps in current sensor technologies besides other purposes. In 2007, the FCTO requirements for the Hydrogen, Fuel Cells & Infrastructure Technologies Program Multi-Year Research, Development, and Demonstration Plan (the Multi-Year Project Plan, or MYPP) was published [123] and then updated in 2012 [124]. Moreover, in 2007, a shortlist of essential parameters of hydrogen detectors with target specifications was determined [125]. 3.3.1 DOE and NREL The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is dedicated to hydrogen development as an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels in vehicles amongst six alternatives that have been defined in the DOE Vehicle Technologies program. The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) [126], National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and DOE have been collaborating with SDOs and Code Development Organizations (CDOs) to establish proper codes and standards and provide the tools of essential hydrogen infrastructure. To make hydrogen deployment safe and efficient, one crucial element would be applying chemical sensors to address the required performance characteristics of developing hydrogen infrastructure [127]. In 2008, the NREL Hydrogen Sensor Test Laboratory was established to provide an independent and unbiased resource for stakeholders to assess hydrogen sensors in terms of critical performance metrics defined by national and international standards, as well as DOE requirements. In this regard, this laboratory has been collaborating globally with different international test laboratories like the JRC-IET and Transport and the Federal Institute for Materials and Testing (BAM) [128]. Moreover, the NREL laboratory has performed the project in support of the GTR No. 13 (an analyzer to meet Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) exhaust requirements of the GTR No. 13) [36] and other organizations involved in the standard developments like the SAE Technical Information Report TIR J3089 (“Characterization of On-Board Vehicular Hydrogen Sensors”, NFPA 2); the activities of the NREL Hydrogen Sensor Test Laboratory are as follows [115]: • Evaluation of hydrogen sensing performance parameters, sensors, and analyzers under various environmental conditions. • Performance measurements of available hydrogen sensors in markets according to national and international standards and DOE requirements. • Development support and performance evaluation of novel and emerging sensor technologies. • Support for the improvement and updating codes and standards dealing with hydrogen detectors. • Provision of facilities for hydrogen deployment using presenting expert instructions for the use of hydrogen sensors. • Education of the hydrogen community on the appropriate usage of hydrogen sensors. As none of the available sensors in the market is useful for all kinds of applications and meets all the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements, selecting a suitable sensor depends on the target application. To guide sensor developers to satisfy the requirements of hydrogen safety sensors, the Department of Energy (DOE) in The United States provided a shortlist (Table 3 ) of target sensor performances; however, discrepancies are apparent in characteristics of sensor performances based on the targeted application. Also, Table 4 lists the most important requirements for the utilization of hydrogen sensors in vehicles. The table contains information and reports from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Department of Energy (DOE) in the United States, and automotive manufacturers as part of the EU's Sixth Framework Program Integrated Project – StorHy. In general, hydrogen sensors should depict high sensitivity, fast response time, wide dynamic ranges, high selectivity and immunity to common interferences (for instance, humidity and other gases), stability, long durability with acceptable low false-positive responses, operation near room temperatures, and low-cost sensor networks (for widespread commercial sensors) [31]. 3.3.2 JRC–IET Hydrogen sensors have been used to detect hydrogen during production, storage, distribution, or usage. There is an increasing number of available hydrogen sensors in the commercial market. In terms of performance, each type of hydrogen sensor holds its own merits and shortcomings; for instance, some sensor types have extreme sensitivity while others have a wide range of measurements. An appropriate sensor must be selected for a particular application according to environmental conditions. The European Joint Research Centre (JRC) is one of the science-based organizations working on hydrogen technology programs. The Institute for Energy and Transport (IET), scientifically and technically, supports energy issues relating to policymakers of the European Union (EU). The IET, which is one of the seven Institutes of the Joint Research Centre, more specifically focuses on energy supply security to ensure the production of energy in a more sustainable, safer, and cleaner way. Indeed, the JRC serves as a reference center of technology and science for the EU. The JRC/IET activities emphasize pre-normative and underpinning research which deals with developing and improving approaches of performance characterization for hydrogen storage, monitoring, and safety. These activities are endorsed by various state-of-the-art facilities and laboratories [72]. • Performance Tests of Sensors at the JRC-IET The JRC-IET has the cutting-edge testing facility allocated to characterizing the performance and reliability of the hydrogen sensor independently. Regarding the future worldwide use of hydrogen sensors, the assessment of their performances is imperative to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of their operation. The JRC-IET plays a role as a European scientific and technical reference centre and conducts unbiased and trusted research supporting the Community policies about energy. It fulfils the common interest of the Member States and the European citizens regardless of commercial and national interests. Besides other activities, the JRC-IET also communicates with sensor developers and producers, leading to cooperation in the development of hydrogen sensing technologies. Moreover, this centre provides scientific support for international standardization authorities and sensor end-users to improve hydrogen detection gadgets for using hydrogen safely. • Capacities of sensor testing facility In an environmental chamber, up to six sensors can be mounted with a variable composition of temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas to evaluate their influences on the sensor output. The routine hydrogen concentration in air mixtures can be prepared (concentrations in the range of 100 ppm to 2 vol% hydrogens). The range (±2 °C) of −40 °C to +130 °C can be controlled for temperature. The pressure range is 50 kPa up to 250 kPa for the facility. In terms of humidity, possible proportions are 10% at −10 °C and 100% at 60 °C; at lower or higher temperatures, the achievable relative humidity will experience an increase and decrease, respectively. To assess hydrogen sensor cross-sensitivity to other species like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, ammonia, and sulfur-containing compounds, a new dedicated facility has been developed. Moreover, further facilities allow the evaluation of sensor response and recovery time."
9,Global technical regulation (GTR) number 13,"3.4 Global technical regulation (GTR) number 13 One of the noticeable and main documents involved in the regulation of safety requirements of hydrogen vehicles, and particularly, fuel cell electric vehicles is the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Global Technical Regulation (GTR) Number 13 (Global Technical Regulation on Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles). This document, which is considered a formal basis for national regulations for FECV safety in different nations including North America (led by the United States), Japan, Korea, and the European Union, aims to address the existent technological barrier to improve and facilitate hydrogen vehicle marketing and trade by providing a plan for the international harmonization of FCEV safety requirements. The GTR includes various requirements for FCEV safety, namely, electrical, pressure, mechanical, and other ones. When it comes to hydrogen monitoring requirements and safety standards, this regulation focuses on permitted hydrogen emission levels in vehicle enclosures (whether in-use or post-crash test conditions) and in-vehicle exhausts throughout specific modes of regular operation. In terms of incorporation into national regulations, some methods must be adopted to confirm the agreement. Thus, via a collaborative program, sensor laboratories at NREL in the United States and the European Joint Research (JRC) in the Netherlands have been developing analytical methods to meet the GTR hydrogen emission requirement compliantly [36,70]. Based on this regulation, vehicles should be equipped with on-board hydrogen detectors to monitor a hydrogen leak and warn the driver, starting at very low hydrogen concentrations (approximately 0.4% hydrogen in air, or 10% of the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) of hydrogen, 4.1%). Provided that the leak continues and the hydrogen level reaches 25%–50% of the LFL (1–2%), the vehicle will isolate the fuel into the Compressed Hydrogen Storage Systems (CHSS) through closing in-tank solenoid(s), preparing enough battery power to stay safe. Accordingly, based on safe design, the vehicle will shut down and cannot be restarted. Moreover, in the case of airbags are utilized in a collision, the fuel will be isolated. Like gas sensors and through the same mechanism, collision sensors activation will lead to the shutdown of the hydrogen supply. Furthermore, the vehicles permanently monitor pressure as part of onboard detection [110]. In terms of hydrogen monitoring, the GTR has defined two requirements for hydrogen release which are stated in Section 5 of the GTR (Performance Requirements), including: • Vehicle exhaust system (GTR Section 5.2.1.3.2) As mentioned before, the hydrogen content in vehicle exhausts is important, and the discharge must be safe and non-ignitable. Accordingly, to address this issue and verify the safety of the exhaust system, performance-based tests have been designed. Based on the GTR, the allowable hydrogen level in vehicle exhausts must be as below: ➢ Throughout moving and during normal operation (including start-up and not shutdown) with 3-s intervals, the hydrogen concentration must not exceed more than 4% of the volume by average ➢ Never exceed 8%. • The allowable concentration of hydrogen in enclosed space (Post Crash Test Integrity) (GTR Section 5.2.2) ➢ According to the GTR, the concentration of released hydrogen in the air after leakage must not exceed 3 ± 1.0% by volume in different compartments of a vehicle like a passenger, luggage, and cargo compartments."
10,An overview of technologies (expected to be) used in fuel cell vehicles for hydrogen detection,"Hydrogen sensors are the key components for the safety of hydrogen fuel-driven systems, in particular, hydrogen leak detection in the car. Regarding the detection of hydrogen in automotive, hydrogen sensing has faced some challenges relate to hydrogen specific properties. Generally, a few detection principles have been presented, and a few manufacturers able to fabricate the devices meeting the rigorous standards and requirements of automotive applications such as durability, service lifetime, and measurement reliability [133,134]. Hydrogen sensors are used in the fuel cell (FC) powertrain (anode hydrogen sensor, exhaust hydrogen sensor, and vent-line hydrogen sensor), and as a safety sensor in the vehicle (ambient hydrogen sensors in the passenger cabin and vehicle underbody/tank system) [134]. Besides, regarding several environmental loads, the relative concentration of hydrogen in a gas mixture within a range of 0–100 vol% and 0–10 vol% is measured by two types of sensors (anode and exhaust) [134] (Table 5 ). Fuel-cell electric vehicles demand various sensor types such as high concentration sensors as well as conventional ones utilized in combustion engine vehicles [135,136]. Although hydrogen is a clean fuel-producing no environmental contaminants in combustion reactions, careful consideration is required for its production, storage, and distribution attributed to an explosive reaction in the presence of oxygen [137,138]. Moreover, due to economic and safety aspects, the leakage of the gas should be detected by an appropriate sensor in these sorts of vehicles [139,140]. According to the literature, there are several technologies for hydrogen detection; the most common techniques are: catalytic sensors, electrochemical sensors, metal-oxide sensors, thermal conductivity sensors, optical sensors, palladium (alloy) films, and combined technology sensors. Based on the automotive standards relating to measurement reliability and service lifetime, as well as sensor durability, some of them are suitable for utilization in automobiles. Thermal conductivity technologies have evolved as the most promising alternative for automotive sensors due to promising advantages such as being inert to cross-sensitive effects as well as vulnerability to thermal changes of the device (which should be stabilized to meet the standards of sufficient long-term reliability and measurement accuracy in automotive applications) [134]. However, other kinds of technologies are also considered by researchers for use in automobiles. Boon-Brett and colleagues [114] assessed the performance of commercially available hydrogen safety sensors for automotive applications in typical conditions. It was concluded that catalytic sensors accurately measured hydrogen concentrations with a response independent of ambient factors. Nonetheless, there was considerable cross-sensitivity to carbon monoxide and significant power consumption. In terms of metal-oxide semi-conductive sensors, they suffer from low accuracy (which can be improved using nanomaterials and MEMS technology), strong reliance on environmental parameters, low detection limit, and low cross-sensitivity to carbon monoxide. Despite weaknesses, small size, low cost, and low power consumption make them appropriate for use in automobiles. Electrochemical sensors also exhibit low detection limits, high variation during ambient parameters alteration, cross-sensitivity, and accuracy tests. Even though thermal conductivity sensors, which are costly, illustrate a high detection limit and strong temperature reliance, they can be utilized as safety sensors in automobiles. In the following, among various technologies for hydrogen inspection, the ones (expected to be) employed in fuel cell vehicles so far and some of the newly developed ones will be discussed in short; for detailed information on the principles of hydrogen detection technologies, please, refer to Refs. [132,141–144]."
11,Catalytic hydrogen sensors,"4.1 Catalytic hydrogen sensors Catalytic sensors are composed of two thin platinum wires. Each is embedded in a ceramic bead (pellistor) and connected through a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3 ). One pellistor catalyzes hydrogen oxidation selectively; the bead is coated with a catalyst (platinum or other noble metals). When the pellistor is heated to ca. 500–550 °C, hydrogen is oxidized on the active bead surface, leading to an increase in temperature and platinum filament resistance. As a result, the Wheatstone bridge imbalance can be related to the concentration of hydrogen linearly. Catalytic sensors have some specifications; namely, they require oxygen for operation, are not completely hydrogen-selective, and considerable electrical power for operation is of necessity. It is worth mentioning that this kind of sensor is commonly employed in the petroleum industry. Similar to other solid-state sensors, Modern Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) can be used to improve the power requirements and response time [31]. For instance, in terms of catalytic type combustible gas sensors, Shin et al. [145] fabricated a thermoelectric gas sensor (TGS) based on a synergistic combination of catalytic combustion and thermoelectric conversion. Thermoelectric thin-film materials and processes, microfabrication technology for membrane structure, and the ceramic integration process of the catalyst combustor (a thick-film ceramic Pt/alumina catalyst combustor) on micro-device led to robust and reliable operation as well as wide-range and selective detection. The sensor was able to detect hydrogen at 0.5 ppm in air and depicted a long lifetime for practical applications. As mentioned earlier, according to reliability analysis of various hydrogen sensors conducted by Boon-Brett, Bousek et al. [114], catalytic sensors can be used in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in case their related problems, such as power consumption and cross-sensitivity, are solved."
12,Electrochemical sensors (EC),"4.2 Electrochemical sensors (EC) In these sensors, an electrochemical reaction is carried out between cathodes and anodes (hydrogen is oxidized by a catalyst like platinum coated on an electrode). Then, a signal (current or voltage) is produced through a non-linear relationship with hydrogen concentration [146]. Amperometric and potentiometric sensors (Fig. 4 ) are electrochemical sensors producing current or potential, in turn, proportional to the gas concentration. Despite promising advantages such as great sensitivity, a broad linear range, and low energy power consumption, there are some disadvantages, including a two-year lifetime, limited temperature range, moderate selectivity, sensitivity to environmental conditions (pressure), and a decrease in sensitivity attributed to deterioration of electrode catalyst. In comparison, the response from potentiometric sensors is logarithmic (lower accuracy at higher concentrations), while that of amperometric ones is linear (more sensitive) [141,142,147]. Totally, various types of sensors such as catalytic [137,148], thermal conductivity based [149,150], electrochemical [151,152], resistance-based [153,154], work function based [155,156], optical [157,158], and acoustic [159] have been fabricated for leakage detection. They indicate a detection range up to 4% and are limited in monitoring high-concentration hydrogen gas employed in fuel-cell electric vehicles [160,161]. Thus, the development of a wide-detection-range sensor is of necessity. Recently, Jung et al. [162] fabricated and characterized a high-concentration potentiometric hydrogen sensor for fuel-cell vehicles. Although hydrogen sensors have detected hydrogen concentrations less than the lower explosion limit (4% in air), this group created a cost-effective and wide-detection-range Nafion-based potentiometric hydrogen sensor. The detection concentration range was 20–99.99%, and response time was less than 5 s in various environmental conditions (relative humidity, pressure, and temperature), which made the sensor an appropriate candidate for practical applications. Also, due to the Nafion membrane dehydration (it can be protected by a sealing layer), the response altered when the sensor was soaked at 80 °C. According to Korotcenkov et al. [144], it was concluded that electrochemical sensors are stable, consume a small amount of power with a good signal/noise, and able to operate in the absence of oxygen. Moreover, they possess linear operating features, selectivity in practice, excellent repeatability, and accuracy in different designs; nevertheless, they are not completely specific, hold a limited temperature range of operation, and are sensitive to temperature changes. In recent years, electrochemical sensors have been utilized for various applications; however, the developers have not focused on automotive applications, in particular. For example, Mashao et al. [163] used Zinc-based zeolitic benzimidazole framework/polyaniline nanocomposite for hydrogen sensing with a fast steady-state response time of 4 s, and lower detection limit (5.27 μM). Li et al. [164] developed yttria-stabilized cubic zirconia (YSZ) based potentiometric sensor coupled with sensing electrode CdWO4, which indicated response to different concentrations of hydrogen in the 0.5–3 vol% range at 500 °C. Overall, various kinds of sensors with appropriate LODs, detection ranges, working temperatures, and operation in various conditions (for further information, please, refer to Ref. [144]) have been fabricated, while further developments are required for utilization in fuel cell vehicles."
13,Semi-conductive metal-oxide sensors (MOX),"4.3 Semi-conductive metal-oxide sensors (MOX) They comprise a metal-oxide layer with semiconductive characteristics (commonly, doped tin oxide), which is deposited on a heater raising the temperature of the layer to the operating temperature (500 °C). After the diffusion of hydrogen particles into the sensing layer and reaction with oxygen, they are adsorbed on the semi-conductive metal-oxide surface and the electrical resistance of the layer changes (Fig. 5 ). These sensors show adequate sensitivity for hydrogen safety applications. Although they are not selective, they are small, cost-effective, and can conveniently be mass-produced [132,141]. MOX sensors are fabricated using wide bandgap semiconductor materials. Regarding the disadvantages, although ambient temperature fluctuation does not influence MOX sensors, the calibration curve is affected by moisture variation. They also have long response and recovery time [165,166]. Moreover, they require oxygen for stable operation/response and should not be exposed to a high concentration of hydrogen [167]; however, the impacts of pressure and relative humidity on this sort of sensors as well as their selectivity and long-term stability are to be more evaluated [141]. Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) is a type of MOX sensors consisting of a metal layer, an insulator layer (usually made of an oxide), and a semiconductor layer. MOS sensors, which can act as capacitive sensors like MOSFET transistors or Schottky diodes, operate based on charge build-up and altering the function of the active layer (a noble metal or noble metal alloy like palladium-based alloys) [24,25]. The sensor can work properly in the absence of oxygen. MOX sensors are highly considered due to the simple structure, high sensitivity with a fast response, small size, and low cost [132,141]. In addition to various types of technologies applied, including electrochemical, catalytic, and thermo-conductive methods, conductometric sensors have gained a great deal of attention due to feasibility, low cost, and high sensitivity [168,169]. Amongst different semiconducting metal oxides as a sensitive layer to hydrogen [170,171], SnO2 with a wide direct bandgap (Eg = 3.6 eV at 300 K) illustrated high conductivity, tunable structure, and appropriate chemical stability. Also, both pure SnO2 and its composite (e.g. p-NiO/n-SnO2 heterojunction) nanomaterials (with various morphologies like nanorods, nanofibers, and nanowires) were broadly investigated for hydrogen detection [172,173]. Most of the hydrogen sensors show a lack of sensitivity to hydrogen, and there is possible cross-sensitivity leading to false warning and undetected dangerous situations. For instance, when an automobile is in a road tunnel or underground parking, in the presence of carbon monoxide as a result of exhaust pollutants with incomplete ventilation, there exists a possible interference in the hydrogen sensing process [174]. Thus, a sensitive and selective hydrogen sensor is required to reduce possible problems through detection. Several selective hydrogen sensors have been fabricated, which are insensitive to CO, CH4, etc. at low concentrations [175–177]. Moreover, some dopants, particularly noble metals as semiconducting metal oxides, were used for enhancement of sensor performance; nevertheless, noble metals are costly and sensitive to chemical poisons like sulfur species and carbon monoxide. To overcome these disadvantages, research has been focused on finding a cheap and sulfur tolerant dopant for SnO2 [174,178]. Lavanya et al. [174] developed a selective hydrogen leak conductometric sensor based on chemically (transition metal ion (Mn, Co)) doped SnO2 nanoparticles for automotive applications. While Mn has been less evaluated as a dopant material for SnO2-based gas sensors, Co showed its suitability for SnO2 hydrogen sensing enhancement. In comparison with pristine and Mn-doped SnO2, Co was able to improve SnO2 nanoparticle sensing. Regarding the sensor performance, it was assessed at various temperatures and hydrogen concentrations. The sensor selectivity was also assessed in the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) and proper response, suitable selectivity, and reproducibility (to 2000 ppm Hydrogen, RSD = 2.9%) were achieved at the working temperature of 250 °C. The response (Ra/Rg) and response/recovery time were 100 and 3/15s, respectively. Furthermore, there was no response fluctuation in the typical range of humidity (40–70% RH). All in all, the Co-doped SnO2 sensor could be promising for hydrogen detection in automobiles and stand out as a 10 wt% Co–SnO2 sensor amongst the best hydrogen leak conductometric devices. A vast majority of conductometric hydrogen sensors have used noble metals such as palladium and platinum, which are high in cost, because of their high catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation [131,179,180]. Thus, several sensors have been fabricated based on cheaper materials [175,181,182]. Metal-oxide semiconductors, for instance, SnO2, TiO2, ZnO, CuO, and Cr2O3, have been broadly utilized to sense various toxic and flammable gases [183–185]. Among them, SnO2 was highly considered due to its advantages such as bearing a bandgap of 3.6 eV and a high exciton binding energy at room temperatures as well as low cost, superior electron mobility, and proper thermal and chemical stability [186]. As SnO2 has some negatives, such as high operating temperature and poor selectivity/sensitivity, different strategies have been used to overcome the drawbacks. Several pieces of research suggest that the use of suitable dopant (between remedies such as metal nanoparticle-based decoration, the modification of surface morphology, the construction of the heterojunction, and the addition of the catalyst) would benefit the response, selectivity, optimum operating temperature, and response/recovery time of SnO2 based sensors [187,188]. Transition metal dopants, such as Zn, Mn, Co, Cu, and Cr, indicated their great results in the improvement of SnO2 sensors. Rare earth elements doping was also shown to significantly enhance the response of the sensors [187]. In this context, among various types of rare-earth dopants utilized [189,190], Er was selected for further investigation by Singh et al. Concerning the sensors capable of sensing hydrogen and ethanol in steam reforming systems combined with fuel cells, Singh et al. [187] developed a tunable dual selective sensor based on 3% Er-doped SnO2 nanoparticles with temperature-dependent selectivity to hydrogen (360 °C) and ethanol (240 °C) and the response/recovery time of 11/42s. Large surface area, huge oxygen vacancies, and increased surface basicity of doped nanoparticles result in an enhanced response of the sensor. All in all, the fabricated sensor was a perfect candidate for ethanol-hydrogen detection in ethanol steam reforming systems combined with fuel cells. Regarding semiconductor oxides, n-type ones (SnO2 and ZnO) have been more investigated compared to their counterpart (p-type). In recent years, new technologies have emerged to grow nanostructures made of p-type metal oxides [191,192]. Due to acceptable electrical features, chemical stability, and the relative novelty of its nanostructures, Tonezzer et al. [193] evaluated nickel oxide as a p-type semiconductor metal oxide for the fabrication of hydrogen sensors. Tonezzer et al. fabricated a nickel oxide (NiO) semiconducting nanowires (a low cost and low maintenance miniaturized sensor), performing properly with stability, response, and recovery time of 20s for hydrogen and 35–40s for ethanol at 350 °C, sensor response of 107% for 1000 ppm H2 at 250 °C and 136% for 500 ppm ethanol at 400 °C, and selectivity factors of about 2.5–3 for both. Overall, the fabricated sensor was ideal as a dual ethanol-hydrogen sensor in ethanol steam reforming systems. In terms of ethanol and hydrogen sensing, Krishnakumar et al. [194] fabricated ZnO-based sensors (they are amongst the first commercialized conductometric sensors [169]) for fuel cell cars, which are equipped with the ethanol steam-reformer, for the production of onboard hydrogen. ZnO-based sensors have been vastly assessed for ethanol and hydrogen sensing previously [195,196]. Krishnakuma and co-workers prepared, characterized, and investigated pure (ZnO) and doped-zinc oxide (Mo- and Cr–ZnO) samples to develop a conductometric sensor platform for hydrogen and ethanol detection. Concerning dopants, while Mo ions have been reported to raise thermal stability of ZnO, Cr was used to improve ethanol sensitivity of ZnO thin film based gas sensors [197,198]. The response of the sensor was affected by temperature, nature, and dopant loading. ZnO-based sensors indicated a response of R0/R = 10–2000 ppm hydrogen and response/recovery time of 5/7s at the operating temperature of 400 °C for hydrogen, which are acceptable properties for a hydrogen leak sensor. It was also shown that both sensors, ZnO and Mo–ZnO, can operate at 250 °C to detect both hydrogen and ethanol simultaneously. Based on these reliable sensors for the detection of hydrogen leakage as well as ethanol in fuel cell vehicles, they finally proposed a conductometric sensor platform. Recently, Li et al. [199] focused on the research progress of hydrogen gas sensors based on TiO2 as the most potential candidate for smart hydrogen gas sensors in the future. It is considered not only a wide bandgap n-type semiconductor with unique electrical, optical, catalytic, and gas sensing characteristics but also non-toxic, low-cost, and highly stable in hostile environments [200,201]. Apart from their unique specifications, it is inferred that there are some challenges relating to TiO2-based hydrogen gas sensors, namely selectivity (the most urgent challenge), surface poisoning (frequent calibration), and sensitivity to moisture; however, some solutions exist to overcome the shortcomings. To obtain detailed information about hydrogen sensing properties of various TiO2 based sensors with different structures like thin-film, nanotube, nanorods, pellet, nanowire, mesoporous, nano-powder, nanocomposite, nanoparticle, etc. with various sensitivity, concentration ranges, working temperatures, and reaction time, please refer to Ref. [199]. Besides, another review paper about hydrogen sensing based on noble metal doped metal-oxide semiconductors was authored by Luo et al. [202]. Noble metals such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), etc. are used to have the sensing performance of semiconductor hydrogen sensors improved through the reduction of the adsorption activation energy of gases on the semiconductor surface. After a comprehensive analysis of various types of sensors, it is implied that besides their advantages, they suffer from some shortcomings which should be solved, for instance, simultaneous palatable sensitivity and linear property, selectivity, and operation at high temperatures. Regarding the ability of metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors in working at/near room temperature, nanofibers, nanorods, or their arrays, porous structures especially mesoporous, and bimetallic doping of noble metals and combination of metal oxide semiconductors with inorganic materials like graphene or monolayer MoS2 would improve sensing properties. Detailed information of heated (SnO2, ZnO, WO3, TiO2, and other metal oxide-based hydrogen sensors) and room temperature (SnO2-based) hydrogen sensors are available on [202]. There are some developed sensors with appropriate response time, detection ranges, and operation temperature (RT), which can be further developed for automotive applications. Based on the literature focused on MOX, MOS, and FET type hydrogen sensors [203], metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors are being designed to overcome the traditional shortcomings. Also, novel metal oxides and noble metals, as well as nanotechnology, are highly considered to improve sensitivity, selectivity, response time, stability, detection ranges, and operation temperature (several research studies are focused on operation at room temperature). This might lead to the fabrication of novel sensors suitable for use in fuel cell vehicles; however, further studies are required for new materials and sensor structures to satisfy the standards and develop particular applications."
14,Thermal conductivity sensors (TC),"4.4 Thermal conductivity sensors (TC) TC sensors are based on a procedure in which the temperature of an electrically heated sensing element changes after exposure to a specific gas (Fig. 6 ). The sensor is heated to the temperature that the sensing element resistance deviates from the limit of Ohm's law (it is clear in the voltage-current plot). Concerning the advantages of these sensors, TC sensors are stable without oxygen requirement, less dependent on contamination, hold a wide detection range of <1–100% H2, and less electric power consumption in comparison with catalytic sensors (MEMS technology can be used to reduce the power requirement). On the other hand, they tend not to have selectivity, however, special coatings have been reported for improvement of this defect. Also, these sensors are sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. They are also combined with another sensitive sensor to measure very low concentrations of hydrogen [141,142,150]. The lower explosion limit has been set to 4 vol% hydrogen in ambient air by the German Federal Institute for Material Research and Testing (BAM) as well as by the DG Joint Research Centre of the European Commission [132]. To prevent an explosion hazard, electrochemical [144] and catalytic [148,205] sensors are broadly employed for monitoring hydrogen in the air. Despite their great sensitivity, chemical sensors have a short lifetime (catalytic ones are affected by P, S, and Si poisoning and cross-sensitive to carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons). On the other hand, thermal conductivity sensors hold the advantages of low power usage and fast operating time as palatable features for hydrogen detection in automobiles. In addition, these sensors indicate long durability and a large measurement range (<1%–100% hydrogen) as well as operation in the absence of oxygen [142,206]. As the thermal conductivity of hydrogen is about seven times higher compared with other gases, this type of sensor looks appropriate for hydrogen detection. The presence of CO2 and helium is negligible since their concentrations are only five and mostly below 5000 ppm (a mole fraction of at least 2% carbon dioxide is required for the compensation of 0.2% hydrogen), in turn [206]. Based on micro-hotplate technology, Berndt et al. [206] presented a thermal conductivity sensor with a lower detection limit of 2000 ppm for hydrogen detection in the laboratory atmosphere. Despite other gas sensors, concentrations below this limit were unable to be sensed [207], but the aim of the study was set on the detection of the 4% hydrogen explosion limit. Also, power consumption decreased by operation in a pulsed mode and hydrogen detection was carried out in the 0–4% range and -15-84 °C temperatures. Due to safety grounds, the assessment was not performed for hydrogen concentration >4%. Also, in terms of humidity, sensor was not affected by water vapor. On the other hand, a thermal conductivity sensor (model XEN-TCG3880, Xensor Corporation, the Netherlands) was fabricated by collaboration of NREL sensor test laboratory with FCH-JU-funded project H2Sense. The manufacturer claimed that response time was less than 250 ms and sensor responses were linear, repeatable, and fast [36,208]. It is clear from the previous literature that the thermal conductivity sensors are the most appropriate ones for automotive applications due to broad measurement range, insensitivity to carbon monoxide (a critical requirement for the hydrogen sensor operating in the automotive environment), immunity to hydrogen sulfide, and less-maintenance-required (they can meet the strict safety requirements in vehicles) [209]. Besides, they have been used in vehicle post-crash tests for hydrogen detection as well as helium [36]. These sensors should be further stabilized against any effective parameters to prevent any malfunction."
15,Optical sensors,"4.5 Optical sensors Sensitive optical sensors have been fabricated to detect hydrogen using optical changes. For instance, micro-mirror sensors sense reflected light alteration after hydrogen absorption, and optic-fiber hydrogen sensors (Fig. 7 ) might detect light transmittance change across the fiber, or employ Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (surface electromagnetic waves propagating along with a metal/dielectric interface in a parallel manner) [132]. Moreover, many devices utilize optical features of palladium films, many of which are not yet commercially available, while some use chemical mediators in the presence of hydrogen. Fiber optic-based devices and colourimetric indicators (requiring no electronic circuitry) are the types of chemically mediated optical hydrogen sensors. The colour of chemical coatings such as tungsten or molybdenum oxide applied on the tip of hydrogen-sensitive fiber optic sensors (with a hydrogen-permeable protection layer against chemical contaminant) alters upon exposure to hydrogen [141,143]. They take advantage of proper sensitivity to hydrogen, facile operation, and long-term stability. In contrast, the response time is relatively slow and its accuracy is less than DOE targets. All in all, optical sensors have gained considerable attention for safety applications [141,211]. Regarding colourimetric indicators, sensors utilized tungsten oxide or molybdenum oxide are being designed and produced for hydrogen detection. The system requires no electronic circuitry for operation or detection, complementing electronic sensor technology. These indicators have been made in various configurations such as hydrogen-indicating paints, tape, cautionary decals, and coatings for hydrogen storage tanks, which have been proved to be environmentally sustainable. The colourimetric sensor is low-cost and conveniently-implemented [212,213]. At last, different techniques are being applied for optical hydrogen detection, which has been described by Hübert et al. [142]. Overall, immediate leakage detection in vehicles besides hydrogen energy storage systems, appliances, and entire hydrogen distribution infrastructure is of great importance. Thus, a response time of 1 s at room temperature, and 0.1–10% concentration range are hydrogen sensor performance targets [214]. To meet the criteria, optical nanoplasmonic hydrogen sensors based on hydride-forming metal nanoparticles have emerged [215–217]. As optical signals produce no sparks and form through hydrogen species absorption into interstitial sites of the metal host, these sensors have gained a lot of attention to make them hydrogen-selective [218]. Due to its ability for efficient dissociation of hydrogen gas at surrounding conditions and a sizable optical contrast, Pd has been considered a functional material [218,219]. But, there exist some unsolved problems such as poisoning by gases like CO [142,220]. To overcome limitations, Nugroho et al. [214] combined Pd/Au alloy plasmonic nanoparticle signal transducers with thin polymer membrane layers. They developed an optical ultra-fast nanosensor encapsulated in a plastic material working based on an optical phenomenon (plasmon), in which metal nanoparticles are illuminated and receive visible light. Plastic, containing millions of metal nanoparticles of palladium-gold alloy, around the sensor prevents other molecules that might deactivate the sensor, and also, it accelerates the adsorption of hydrogen into metal particles for detection and results in an immediate response. This sensor can detect 0.1% hydrogen in the air in less than a second. The sensor was stable for more than 4 months without the risk of deactivation and frequent calibration (attributed to the presence of the plastic). After the evaluation of newly developed optical sensors and according to the review paper written by Zhang et al. [210] about recent advancements in optical fiber hydrogen sensors, it can be concluded that optical hydrogen sensors have performed a significant role in hydrogen measurement. It is predicted that better sensing features would be achieved through the development of thin-film deposition technology. Various types of optical fiber hydrogen sensors have been so far fabricated, including intensity-based, FBG-based, LPG-based, interferometer-based, and SPR-based sensors (detailed information can be found on [210]). Also, performance can be improved through using metals or alloys as sensitive films, or the utilization of advanced deposition techniques, and optimization of sensing head structures. In general, to optimize these optical devices for automotive applications, existing problems [210] relating to optical fiber hydrogen sensors such as nonlinear outputs, low-qualities of sensitive film, slow response rate, temperature disturbances, and humidity influences should be solved. However, promising performances (response time of ≤10s or detection limit of ≤100 ppm) have been reported in the case of Pd NPs utilization in optical hydrogen sensors (more information can be found on [131])."
16,Palladium (alloy) films,"4.6 Palladium (alloy) films The Pd-film technology works based on film resistance alteration through hydrogen adsorption (Fig. 8 ). Also, the film has been used in Field Effect Transistor (FET) devices and performance has been controlled through gate (palladium) sensitivity [221,222]. Generally, major categories of Pd-based hydrogen sensors can be classified as follows [141]: • Palladium resistor sensors (the most popular) • Palladium field-effect transistors (FETs) or capacitor sensors • Palladium optical sensors • Palladium meso-wire (nanowire) and nano-particle sensors • Palladium nanotube and nano-clusters sensors Palladium films are suitable candidates for utilization in mechanical device coating, namely Surface Acoustic Wave Sensors (SAW) or Quartz Crystal Microbalance Sensors (QCM), where palladium mass changes through hydrogen adsorption and resonant frequency alteration. Also, small changes in the frequency can be accurately measured and lead to the detection of lower limits of hydrogen [223,224]. In terms of weaknesses, palladium sensors require oxygen for operation, are dependent on chemical contaminants (mainly sulfide), their long stability has not yet evaluated, and they have shown slow response time (more than 30s) compared to TC sensors; however, some reports have indicated that chemical poisoning can be reduced using protective layers, while faster response time is achievable using MEMS platforms [141,143]. Conventional and commercial H2 sensors are developed mainly based on metal oxides, such as SnO2, TiO2, In2O3, and ZnO [225,226]. To overcome shortcomings of metal oxide-based sensors such as low selectivity and operation at high temperatures (in the 180–500 °C range), catalytic metal particles, like palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), gold (Au), and silver (Ag), were used to decorate not only metal oxides but also enhance sensors performance [142,227]. Pd itself is a sensing material with appropriate H2 sensitivity and based on its great features; it has been used for the fabrication of various sensors such as Pd-film sensors [228,229] and Pd-nanostructure sensors [230–232]. The former is costly, unstable, irreversible, unreliable for high hydrogen concentrations (more than 2%), and long response time for low hydrogen concentrations (less than 1%). On the other hand, the latter, including nanowires, nanochains, nanotubes, and nanocomposites, produces high electrical noise. Also, electron-beam lithography tools or complicated processes are required for single Pd nanowire fabrication [233]. In terms of palladium-based sensors, Hydrogen Sense Technology Co., Ltd 2 2 See www.h2sense.com. developed several commercial sensitive sensors for hydrogen monitoring. These hydrogen sensors operate based on palladium alloy thin-film solid-state hydrogen specific sensor technology. They comprise a hydrogen capacitance and hydrogen resistance sensor, a temperature sensor, a heater, and built-in software to receive a fast response (1–60s) with full range hydrogen detection (15 ppm–100%) in different conditions (high humidity, presence of acidic gases, and vacuum or high pressure) to operate for almost 10 years (for instance, the series 8 hydrogen sensor for hydrogen monitoring in the fuel cell industry). Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory [234] have fabricated a fast, sensitive, reliable, inexpensive, and tiny sensor (ANL-IN-04-077B) as the world's fastest and 2006 R&D 100 award winner outweighing current hydrogen sensor limitations such as cost, operation speed, susceptibility to other gases, and temperature range. In terms of design, a one-molecule-thick layer of siloxane was applied to a glass substrate. While the rest of the long-chain molecule remains slippery, the “sticky foot” of the siloxane molecule binds to the glass strongly. Onto slippery layer, an extremely thin blanket of tiny (2–10 nm) palladium beads was evaporated. The Argonne design utilized an ultra-thin layer of palladium beads, leading to more rapid hydrogen adsorption and better sensitivity because of palladium hydride beads mobility. In comparison with other available technologies in the industry, the sensor has some unique characteristics: • Demands no warm-up with a response time of fewer than 75 ms in a 2% hydrogen atmosphere. • Measures concentrations of hydrogen as low as 0.0025% (25 ppm) without amplification of intricate signals (minor leakage can be detected before complete shutdown). • Senses hydrogen repeatedly, even in the presence of oxygen, water vapor, and other gases. Also, there is no need for heaters or other supplementary power. • Works based on scalable processes are commonly employed to fabricate electronic components, which leads to minimizing the ultimate cost. It is estimated that only $50 worth of palladium is required for approximately 16,000 sensors. • Meets all six response-time and concentration criteria, which are set by the U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) for hydrogen sensors utilized in vehicles, process plants, or pipeline applications as well as personnel monitors. All in all, this sensor holds several potential applications such as auto safety installation, nuclear reactors, medical diagnostics, etc. Until now, bulk and nanostructured palladium with a higher effective surface for the interaction of palladium with hydrogen, have been used in electrical and optical detection techniques as well as less common techniques like gasochromic and surface wave acoustic sensors. Among various configurations employed for sensor fabrication, Pd nanostructures on Si-based substrates, metal oxide substrates or carbon materials, and NPs on Si-based substrates or the core of an optical fiber are more common for electrical hydrogen sensors and Pd NPs-based optical hydrogen sensors, in turn [131]. Despite Pd NPs electrical H2 sensors with a detection limit <5 ppm hydrogen concentration and response time <1 s, Pd NPs-based optical H2 sensors indicated excellent performances hardly (LOD < 10 ppm; response time < 1 s) Also, there exist risks of unguaranteed safety and sensor longevity issues for electrical sensors, while optical ones can overcome these problems. Moreover, the utilization of Pd NPs and bimetallic structures can be a promising method to optimize and improve the performance of optical sensors (please refer to Ref. [131] for detailed information). Moreover, the performance of hydrogen gas sensors based on Pd/carbon nanomaterials, Pd/semiconductor, Pd/metal oxide, and Pd/nanocomposite is also evaluated [235]. Final results revealed that the addition of Pd led to a fast response/recovery time of carbon nanomaterials, semiconductor, and metal oxide-based hydrogen sensors. It was also inferred that the use of different nanomaterials such as nanocubes, nanoparticles, nanowires, nanoclusters, nanoporous, nanotubes, nanorods, nanofibres, core-shell nanostructures, and nanosheets, resulted in the fabrication of high speed and novel hydrogen gas sensors. Nowadays, graphene has gained a great deal of attention due to superb features such as high surface-to-volume ratio (for detecting a single molecule), low electrical noise, and energy consumption [236,237]. Although pure graphene is chemically inert and depicts poor sensitivity to H2, Pd-decorated graphene indicates a promising sensitivity [233]. Recently, Ilnicka et al. [238] studied hydrogen sensors fabricated using graphene and its derivatives. They believe that although the use of graphene in hydrogen sensing is still in the experimental step, there are some negatives points such as lack of data on the chemical stability of graphene-based materials performed in particular conditions(i.e. strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen) and uncertain stability as well as positives points such as operating at room temperature (in some cases), hydrogen detection linearity, almost adjustable sensing range, cross-sensitivity limitation, and almost easy fabrication. Although graphene-based hydrogen sensors have a long way to compete with commercially available ones (mostly based on modified semiconductor metal oxides) [238], it needs to be highly considered by researchers. Regarding the use of nanotechnology in hydrogen sensing, Neo hydrogen sensors GmbH (also called Neohysens), as a part of the Neoxid group, produced several hydrogen monitoring sensors (not yet available on the market) in the automotive application (Table 6 ). For more detailed information, please refer to Ref. [239]. Overall, it is apparent that in recent years researchers have focused on the use of Pd nanomaterials, as well as graphene to improve hydrogen sensors performance; however, it is required to customize the developed sensors for automotive applications, meeting the strict automotive application standards."
17,Combined technology,"4.7 Combined technology Combined sensors are generally made through a combination of various sensing technologies makes. For instance, catalytic and thermal conductivity combination leads to detecting hydrogen in a wide range of concentrations. Several pieces of research indicate that a combination of several technologies would alter detection range (<500 ppm or 100–2000 ppm), operation temperature from 180 to 85 °C, and response time (50 times faster). Besides, the reliability of oxygen refers to the content of the combined sensor. As most research has been focused on sensors integrated with nanomaterials, it is verified that the utilization of nanomaterials in the fabrication of sensors would improve their performance [240,241]. A relatively small-sized H2-Semicon®-Detector (selective MOX gas sensor + thermal conductivity detector) [242] has been developed with promising properties such as highly selective measurement of hydrogen in the 0–10% range (optional up to 100%), high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and safety, with ≤1 s response time at 5.000 ppm (T60). Leakage monitoring, either in fuel cell systems or by mobile and stationary devices, in addition to chemical processes and equipment monitoring in the industry, are some of the applications [243]. Another example in this field is Cyber Genius (Sensitron S.r.L. 3 3 See https://www.sensitron.it/. ), which is developed through a combination of an electrochemical cell and a pellistor sensing platform (based on catalytic combustion in a single device) [244]. The HLS-440 sensor (Applied Sensor GmbH 4 4 See http://www.appliedsensor.com/. ) is another sample fabricated based on a field-effect sensing element combined with a thermal conductivity sensing element, a temperature sensor, and a heater. It can measure 100% of hydrogen, operates in a harsh environment, and holds response (t90) and recovery time (t10) below 5 s and 10 s, respectively [243,245]. Moreover, temperature and humidity sensors can be incorporated into hydrogen sensors. For instance, the XEN-5310 device (Xensor Integration BV), a thermal conductivity-based sensor, can measure 0–4% or 0–100% of hydrogen with a response/recovery time of 1 s [243,244]."
18,Comparison of different hydrogen sensor technologies,"4.8 Comparison of different hydrogen sensor technologies It is worth mentioning that 1s response time, which was an elusive target for DOE, has been met by high-tech manufacturing methods, such as microfabrication of miniaturized devices [130]. Each type of sensor is suitable for a specific application, and it is worthwhile to compare them to select the best one for the application of interest. Table 7 presents the advantages and disadvantages of different types of sensors aforementioned and also their possible applications."
19,Future perspectives,"To meet the energy requirements of increasing energy requirements, finding an alternative and sustainable energy source is indispensable. Among various renewable energy sources, hydrogen is considered a promising candidate due to its unique features such as storable, light, energy-dense, and no pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions. But hydrogen should be adopted in various sectors, including transportation, building, and power generation, to contribute to clean energy transitions. Despite multiple advantages, as an alternative fuel to fossil fuels, hydrogen production costs three times more than petroleum refining [246]. Thus, an efficient and sustainable way should be adopted to mass-produce hydrogen at a lower cost. On the other hand, compared to traditional fossil fuels, hydrogen cannot be easily stored because of its low density and compression and/or cooling are required in terms of storage [27]. It is depicted that the most efficient way for hydrogen storage would be physical containment, particularly in compressed tanks [27]. Also, due to the high cost of material and assembly, the wide-scale usage of compressed hydrogen tanks is limited [27]. Meanwhile, researchers have depicted that public concern of using high high-pressure vessels would be another setback in widespread hydrogen usage as an alternative fuel [247]. Finding an alternative, such as vessels with an internal skeleton, is still under research [27]. In terms of liquid hydrogen, energy efficiency would decrease through usage, storage system loses almost 1% of storage volume per day through boiling, and high refrigeration and insulation are required to adjust hydrogen at 20 K, resulting in additional costs [248]. On the other hand, liquid hydrogen is explosive through mixing with other gases. So, nitrogen gas should be utilized to drain other gases inside the tank [249]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that cryo-compressed vessels can be promising candidates. In tandem with this, more studies are required to determine the durability and public acceptance [27]. Due to high thermal, electrical, photonic, and biochemical energy consumption for hydrogen production from its associated elements, it can be produced from renewable sources without greenhouse gases emission [27,250]. In addition to high costs, it is verified that metal-based compound vessels are heavy and impose additional weight on vehicles [251]. As an alternative, it is suggested that related metal-N-H-systems can be taken into consideration in terms of finding practical pressure and temperature for hydrogen storage [252]. Also, to deem hydrogen an environmentally friendly fuel to propel machines, it is vital to produce hydrogen through alternative ways such as biotechnological processes [11]. Considering various sensor types, each one has several advantages and drawbacks, which have to be solved for adopting the utilization in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. Apart from their positives, Catalytic sensors suffer from high power usage and cross-sensitivity, which should be noticed, in particular, for automotive applications. Electrochemical sensors with appropriate LODs, detection ranges, working temperatures, and the ability to function in different environmental conditions should be further developed and optimized. In terms of metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors, different metal oxides and noble metals and nanotechnology are highly considered to add some advantages to this type of sensor. Among known sensors, thermal conductivity sensors are deemed the most appropriate for automotive applications to meet vehicles' strict safety requirements. Besides, Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based sensors such as piezoelectric [253] and piezoresistive [254,255] sensors offer interesting features such as small-size, low cost and high-accuracy which are highly desirable for hydrogen safety monitoring. Various methods such as artificial intelligence [256] and optimization algorithm [257,258] can be used for the decision-making process. After investigating optical fiber hydrogen sensors, the challenges mentioned above should be solved to optimize optical devices for automotive applications. Nonetheless, a response time of ≤10s or a detection limit of ≤100 ppm has been reported when Pd NPs were utilized. Moreover, researchers have recently concentrated on using Pd, nanomaterials, and graphene to enhance the performance of hydrogen sensors. Concerning Pd-based sensors with their great performances, it is required to customize the developed ones for automotive applications. In terms of advanced sensing technology, a trend exists toward combining several technologies as smart/intelligent detection devices, which can benefit hydrogen sensor development and lead to at least a wide measuring range and better response time. Thus, it is helpful to develop combined sensors in the foreseeable future. Another development in hydrogen sensor fabrication refers to microfabrication, by which submicron to millimeter-scaled devices are made, leading to lower costs and better performance. This fabrication method has been used in different sensor types such as catalytic, thermal conductivity-based, and metal-oxide sensors. Promising results such as a response time of 0.36s for miniaturization of hydrogen pellistor technology have been obtained [259]. Although hydrogen technology has been developed in recent years, several gaps in this field need to be filled in the foreseeable future [130]. Recently, the JRC [132] and NREL [129] developed a comprehensive review of sensor metrics and gaps [130]. As a result of remarkable variability in design from one producer to another, it is challenging to compare sensor performances even for different models of the same platform. A list of current issues on hydrogen sensors' performance has been developed by the NREL and JRC sensor laboratories in collaboration with the hydrogen community. Some performance gaps are discussed in the following [130]: In terms of general metrological metrics, the performance parameters of equipment are essential for a hydrogen sensor. These are metrics directly associated with the sensor capability of conducting the analytical evaluations dependent on the desired application. However, some metrics still are suffering from existent gaps: • Selectivity: False alarm prevention is considered one of the vital elements to ensure end-users' confidence in sensor technology. In this regard, it is necessary to determine potential factors that may result in a false alarm. Despite models not reacting to methane, catalytic hydrogen sensors, in the presence of other combustible gases, tend to alarm. Hence, it must be noticed that hydrogen sensors should not be employed in an atmosphere with an interferent, which creates a false response. Among hydrogen sensors, palladium-based ones bear almost ideal selectivity to hydrogen. • Lifetime/Sensor Stability (Impact of Environment): Regarding the importance of factors influencing long-term sensor stability under normal deployment conditions, this issue is required to be studied comprehensively. For instance, physical stressors like fluctuations in environmental parameters (temperature, pressure, relative humidity) can impact the sensor background signal, leading to an increase in the device degradation rate. On the other hand, chemical stressors (pollutants), even without a measurable signal, may also influence the functionality of catalysts during the time and cause sensor failure. • Deployment Metrics: Deployment parameters can be related to either the installation or incorporation of the sensor for a particular application and are generally one-time up-front considerations such as the sensor's up-front cost (for more information, refer to the list of logistic metrics in Ref. [129]). Furthermore, sensor placement is another noticeable factor concerning the optimization of the efficiency of sensors. Although there are typically suggested locations for the placement of sensors within a facility, they are often according to intuition. There are no official instructions on sensor positioning, and there is no instruction in documents such as the NFPA 2 or the IFC [260]. • Operational Metrics: Operational factors include the metrics related to the operation and maintenance of sensors after their installation. In contrast to deployment factors, these metrics include ongoing or recurring deliberations or activities. As an excellent example of operational metrics that includes calibration requirements of the sensor, the maintenance cost is deemed a significant barrier by many end-users (Also, Buttner, Burgess et al. have discussed other operational metrics [129]). • Maintenance Cost (including calibration cost): Two parameters influence the cost of a hydrogen sensor possession, including the upfront cost (e.g., the purchase price) and the maintenance expenditure. Regarding the need for regular calibrations, a considerable proportion of sensor owners' expense relates to maintenance. This requirement is deemed a major barrier to hydrogen sensor acceptance [129]. • End-of-life Indication: Normally, the safety sensor output is zero or at a baseline reading. Hence, a sensor's functionality is dealt with a challenge in terms of the need for a hydrogen test gas, which is limited to calibration procedures. Consequently, a non-functional sensor will result in a hazardous false negative."
20,Conclusion,"Due to natural sources and fossil fuels diminution and the demands on transportation and industry development, finding renewable energy sources is indispensable. Nowadays, the utilization of hydrogen as an alternative fuel has gained considerable attention due to emissions that can be minimized to zero. Despite promising advantages, the mass utilization of hydrogen for transportation suffers from weaknesses such as production from fossil fuels, a fast expansion leading to self-combustion, the flammable and explosive mixture in terms of combination with air, low combustion energy which results in combustion, low viscosity and small molecules necessitating gaskets of fuel tanks, undistinguishable leak, fast-spreading, and invisible flame. In summary, safety issues with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, including hydrogen leakage from vessels and subsequent consequences such as fire and explosion, are discussed in this paper. Also, leakage monitoring and control systems, including regulations and standards and various sensors applicable in this area, are taken into consideration.
