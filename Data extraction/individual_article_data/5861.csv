0,Introduction,"The new energy, especially, the regenerative hydrogen energy is one of the most promising alternative energy with significant influence on the socio-economic development in nearly future. With the development of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, the technology of hydrogen storage and release have received extensively attention [1–5]. Ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) is considered as a superior hydrogen storage material due to its properties of high hydrogen content (19.6 wt%), low molecular weight, environment friendly and high stability [6–8]. AB release hydrogen relative easily in the ambient temperature via AB hydrolysis catalyzed by suitable catalyst [9–11]. Therefore, the technology of AB hydrolysis can be applied in vehicle hydrogen production system for on-board fuel cell. Although many researchers have made unremitting efforts to improve the hydrolysis efficiency of AB, the hydrolysis rate of ammonia borane is still too low to meet the requirement of on-board hydrogen fuel cell. Recently, some researchers adopted the photocatalytic technique to photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen [12,13]. Pant et al. [14] synthesize CdS-TiO2 nanocomposite to photocatalytic ammonia borane hydrolysis for producing hydrogen, the results suggest CdS-TiO2 nanocomposite exhibit a strong activity for photocatalytic ammonia borane hydrolysis in visible light. Lai et al. [15], Song et al. [16] confirm that ammonia borane can be hydrolyzed to produce hydrogen via photocatalysis reaction. This provides a new way for improving AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen effectively. β-SiC is considered to be an excellent photocatalyst due to its nontoxic and plentiful characteristics, and as its suitable band gap and environmental friendly properties usually used for photocatalyst in producing hydrogen and treating pollutant [17,18]. However, due to the wider band gap and relatively low surface activity, the photocalytic activity of β-SiC is always unsatisfied to meet the requirement. The experimental and quantum mechanical calculation results of β-SiC catalytic reactions suggest that the catalytic reactions process always occurred in the surface of β-SiC refer to the Si sites or C sites. Therefore, modifying the activity of surface atom should be the effective means to improve the surface reaction rate. For this reason, many researchers have tried to modify β-SiC with different metal or nonmetal element. For instance, Da Wang et al. [19] prepared the photocatalyst of Au deposited on the SiC composite surface for hydrogen production via water reduction, and revealed the Au element modified the performance of SiC in efficient charges separation and accelerated water reduction rate on SiC surface. Wang et al. [20] investigate Pt nanoparticle-decorated SiC nanowire to enhanced photocatalytic activity for water splitting to produce hydrogen, and found photoelectrons of C atom can be rapidly transferred to Pt active sites in the water-splitting reaction. In this report, we present our research findings on visible light-induced photocatalyst to catalytic hydrolysis of AB. β-SiC(1 1 1) is the base plane of the β-SiC crystal, it have the preferable surfactivity compared with the other crystal face. β-SiC nanowires were prepared to ensure the catalyst β-SiC exposes more surfaces (1 1 1). In addition, due to the wide band gap of semiconductor photocatalyst β-SiC, some noble metal were deposited on the β-SiC to modified its band structure, and enhance its photocatalytic activity. In the basis of our previous research results [21], the deposited metal nanoparticles can catalytic hydrolysis of AB. Therefore, the deposited metal play two roles, the first function is modify the optical properties of semiconductor catalysts, which make the photocatalysis more efficient, the other is catalytic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen directly. In this study, we mainly focus on the photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen, conventional metal catalyzed hydrolysis of AB to produce hydrogen, and their synergetic effect on AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen. Finally, illuminate the nechanism of photocatalytic enhance AB hydrolysis efficiency for hydrogen production, and propose a high-efficiency way to produce pure hydrogen in the mild conditions."
1,Experiments and DFT calculations,
2,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts β-SiC nanowires is synthesized by the sol-gel carbothermal reduction method [22], the principle of reaction depicted in the Eq. (1). The details are depicted as follows: 50 mL of TEOS (AR) was mixed with 10 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol (AR) under magnetic stirring for 30 min, 30 mL of HCl was added into the mixed solution drop by drop. Then 4.8 g of expansible graphite was added into the mixed solution until it transformed into Sol form. the gel was dried at 95 °C for 10 h to dry it. Then, the graphite crucible with the xerogel was heated to 1200 °C and maintained for 4 h. Finally, the light gray β-SiC products were prepared. (1) Si O 2 ( s ) + C ( s ) → S i C ( s ) + C O 2 ( g ) Pt-Ru/β-SiC composites nanowires were prepared by liquid phase reducing method. Typically, 0.5 g prepared β-SiC nanowires was added to 30 mL anhydrous ethanol solution, sonicating mixed solution for 25 min to homogeneous dispersion. 19.8 mg H2PtCl6·6H2O or 19.3 mg RuCl3·3H2O were added to the above solution, stirred for 10 min by magnetic stirrer. Then adding into the NaBH4 (0.6 M, 5 mL) with violent shaking. The reaction persisted until no air bubbles produce. Finally, the final product was washed with ethanol and deionized water twice times, respectively, and then dried in inert atmosphere. Both metal loadings of Pt/β-SiC and Ru/β-SiC nanowires are about 5.5 wt%."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with a nickel filtrated Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on a SU8020 scanning electron microscope, operated at an accelerating voltage of 3.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken with a JEM 1200EX transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. UV/Vis absorption spectra were taken on the UV-3600 (Shimadzu Corporation) spectrometer at room temperature. Photoluminescence data (PL) were acquired using a FLS1000 (Edinburgh) spectrophotometer at room temperature. Xenon lamps are the light source used in photocatalytic reactions."
4,Computational details,"2.3 Computational details Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed using spin-polarization DFT/GGA with the PBE exchange-correlation functional as implemented in MS8.0 package. The convergence criteria were set to fine quality with a tolerance for self-consistent field (SCF), optimization energy, maximum force, and maximum displacement were set to the value of 10−5 eV, 1 × 10−5 eV, 0.03 eV/Å and 0.001 Å, respectively. Energy cutoff was set to the value of 375 eV, which meet the requirements of accuracy and convergence. Converged set of k-points were employed with a grid of 7 × 7 × 1 k-points for SCF convergence [23]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization supports of semiconductor photocatalysts,"3.1 Characterization supports of semiconductor photocatalysts To investigate the microscopic morphological of the prepared semiconductor photocatalysts, SEM and TEM were used to investigate the microscopic morphological of the Pt/β-SiC and Ru/β-SiC nanowire. Fig. 1 shows the prepared β-SiC nanowires are the light gray powder. Its diameter varies from 80 to 150 nm, the length ranges from 20 to 30 μm. Fig. 1(d)–(f) depict TEM of β-SiC, Pt/β-SiC and Ru/β-SiC. We can find the reactive metal Pt, Ru are dispersed on the β-SiC evenly, the particle size of Ru cluster is smaller than Pt cluster though they are prepared based on the same technical approach. This may be ascribed to the Pt aggregates more easily than Ru. Fig. 2 show EDS mapping images of prepared Pt/β-SiC and Ru/β-SiC NWs. Pt, Ru deposited on the β-SiC NWs successfully, and the contents of Pt, Ru in Pt/β-SiC and Ru/β-SiC NWs are 5.46% and 5.21%, respectively, which within the error allowed. Fig. 3 show XRD patterns of β-SiC, Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC composite nanowires, respectively. The obvious four sharp peaks located at 35.7°, 41.5°, 60.1°, 71.9°. Base on the ICDD Data, JCPDS Card (No. 29-1129), these diffraction peaks could be attributed to the diffraction of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1) planes of β-SiC NWs, respectively. The weak peak (2θ = 33.7°) marked with SF is ascribed to the stacking faults (SF). For the XRD patterns of the Pt/β-SiC NWs, three diffraction peaks appear at 39.8°(1 1 1), 46.3°(2 0 0), 67.5°(2 2 0), which are indexed to the phase of Pt crystalline (ICDD Data, JCPDS Card No. 87-0646). While the XRD patterns of the Ru/β-SiC NWs, no diffraction peaks relate to the phase of Ru crystalline, this may be ascribed to the high dispersion of active metal, and this is in accordance with the particle size of Ru is smaller than Pt. In addition, the height of Pt/β-SiC NWs, Ru/β-SiC NWs diffraction peak is lower than the β-SiC NWs. Combined TEM analysis, Pt and Ru nano-clusters successful coupled to the β-SiC NWs, and Pt and Ru nano-clusters deposited on the β-SiC NWs may suppress the diffraction intensity of β-SiC NWs."
7,UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra and photoluminescence (PL) analysis,"3.2 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra and photoluminescence (PL) analysis Generally, UV–vis absorption behavior is associated with the light absorb property and photo-induced electron excitation and transfer of a photocatalyst [24,25]. The optical property of β-SiC, Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC composite nanowires were investigated using UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. All the composite nanowires catalysts can absorb spectral region from ultraviolet light to visible light, shown in Fig. 4 (a). The light absorption intensity of Pt/β-SiC nanowires is obviously enhance in the visible region compared with the clean β-SiC nanowires, and the similar rules is also observed in the Ru/β-SiC nanowires, this suggests that the deposition of Pt, Ru nanoclusters make the photocatalyst β-SiC nanowires response spectral range redshift. To investigate the modification mechanism in optical property of Pt/β-SiC and Ru/β-SiC nanowires, the band-gap (Eg ) energies and band structure (ECB, EVB ) of β-SiC, Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC composite nanowire were calculated by the ‘Tauc plot’ and ‘Mulliken electronegativity’ method, respectively. The Tauc plot, Mulliken electronegativity calculation formula are shown in Eqs. (2)–(4). The calculation results depicted in Figs. 4(b) and 5. The band gap of β-SiC, Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC composite nanowires are determined to be 2.36 eV, 1.97 eV and 1.74 eV. The diminution of band gap make the required photon energy to excite electrons decrease, which is consistence with the red shift of the spectrum absorption edge. Base on the calculation results of the band structure, the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potentials of β-SiC composite nanowires are determined to be −0.21 eV: 2.15 eV (Fig. 5 ). β-SiC composite nanowires have a lower valence band position, so the photo-generated holes have the strong oxidation capacity. Meanwhile, photo-generated electrons also have the relatively strong reducing ability due to the higher conduction band position of β-SiC. Therefore, β-SiC composite nanowires have a suitable band structure in photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen. In photocatalytic reaction system, the photo-induced electrons was excited from the CB of Pt-Ru/β-SiC nanowires (Pt/β-SiC NWs, Ruβ-SiC NWs), and then photo-induced electrons was migrated to Pt-Ru, which transfer these photo-induced electrons to the surface active sites efficiently due to its excellent conductivity. In summary, Pt-Ru nanoclusters deposited on the β-SiC nanowires, which modified the band structure of the β-SiC nanowires. In a word, the deposited Pt, Ru nanoclusters not only act as an electron collector and a reduction site, but also the chemical modifier on the band structure of the β-SiC nanowires. Therefore, the Pt-Ru nanoclusters act two function, one is promote the generation of photo-induced electrons, the other is improve the charge separation by the means of transferring electrons to the reduction site, which is consistent with the Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC nanowires absorbed the wider spectrum than β-SiC nanowires. (2) ( α h ν ) 1 / n = A h ν - E g (3) E CB = X - E e - 0.5 E g (4) E VB = E CB + E g In the formula, α, h, ν, A, Eg refer to absorbency index, Planck constant, light frequency, constant, semiconductor band gap, respectively. E CB , E VB , X refer to conduction band, valence band, the electronegativity geometric mean of all the atoms, respectively. To further prove the vital role of the Pt-Ru nanoclusters in photo-induced electrons excitation and transfer of the β-SiC NWs, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments of β-SiC, Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC composite nanowires were performed. As shown in Fig. 6 , Apparently, Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC composite nanowires perform much lower emission intensity than β-SiC composite nanowires, According to the literature report [26], the intensity of the PL peaks is an important indicator for the recombination rate of electrons-hole pairs. Therefore, Pt-Ru nanoclusters doped β-SiC NWs can suppress the recombination of electron-hole pairs effectively, and elongate the lifetime of charge carriers, which is favorable for ammonia borane hydrolysis to produce hydrogen. Simultaneously, it is the reason for the perfect photoactivity of the Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC composite nanowires compared with the pristine β-SiC."
8,Catalytic activity and reusability of the prepared photocatalysts,"3.3 Catalytic activity and reusability of the prepared photocatalysts The prepared photocatalysts β-SiC, Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC composite nanowires are used to catalyze AB hydrolysis to hydrogen evolution. AB hydrolysis reaction is taken place in the aqueous solution. All catalytic reactions are conducted under the conditions of 50 mL H2O, the molar ratio of catalyst and AB is 0.30, room temperature. The light source is 300 W Xe light(CEL-HXF300). Fig. 7 presents the hydrogen production rates of the photocatalytic AB hydrolysis for producing hydrogen. As the Fig. 7(a) shown, without light irradiation, 1 mol AB photocatalytic hydrolysis completely can produce 3 mol hydrogen. In the Pt/β-SiC NWs catalytic AB hydrolysis reaction, the reaction lasts 7′35″ (7 min 35 s), while Ru/β-SiC NWs take 8′52″ (8 min 52 s), this suggest that the catalytic activity of Pt/β-SiC NWs is more effective than Ru/β-SiC NWs in AB hydrolysis reaction. Considering of control experiment of pure β-SiC NWs, the catalytic activity of pure β-SiC NWs in AB hydrolysis was not observed, and some results can be inferred that the Pt nanoclusters have the higher catalytic activity compared with Ru nanoclusters due to the Ru and Pt are the only active metal of the Ru/β-SiC NWs and Pt/β-SiC NWs. However, it is noteworthy that, under the light irradiation, Ru/β-SiC NWs presents the better catalytic activity than Pt/β-SiC NWs of the complete reaction time are 4′40″ and 5′09″, respectively. The results suggest that Ru/β-SiC NWs is the perfect photocatalyst in catalytic AB hydrolysis, and this because of the Ru/β-SiC NWs have the smaller band gap and a suitable band structure compared with the Pt/β-SiC NWs. The pure β-SiC NWs could not catalytic AB hydrolysis completely even the reaction lasted ten minutes under the light irradiation. Moreover, we can conclude that in the Ru/β-SiC NWs and Pt/β-SiC NWs catalyze AB hydrolysis reaction system, which have two reaction types of photocatalytic AB hydrolysis and conventional metal catalyze AB hydrolysis. This affords evidence to some extent for the synergistic effect of the photocatalysis and conventional metal catalysis. In order to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of Ru/β-SiC NWs and Pt/β-SiC NWs in catalyzing AB hydrolysis to hydrogen, TOF is calculated and the calculation method as shown in Eq. (5). The results are depicted in Fig. 7(c). Under the dark conditions, The TOF of the Pt/β-SiC NWs and Ru/β-SiC NWs catalyze AB hydrolysis to hydrogen are 18.0 min−1 and 14.0 min−1. While in the light condition, the TOF of Pt/β-SiC NWs and Ru/β-SiC NWs are 26.5 min−1 and 27.4 min−1, respectively, and the results are superior to the transition metal active component catalyst Ni/g-C3N4 reported in other literatures (TOF = 18.7 min−1). (5) TOF = P atm V g / R T n metal t In the formula, TOF is the turnover frequency, P atm is the standard atmospheric pressure, V g is the volume of the generated H2, R is the universal gas constant, T is room temperature (the value is set to 298 K), n metal is the mole number of the reactive metal, t is the reaction time. The reusability of a catalyst is one of the critical aspects besides catalytic activity. Therefore, reusability tests are conducted of Ru/β-SiC NWs photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to hydrogen evolution, depicted in Fig. 8 . Ru/β-SiC NWs can catalyze hydrolysis of 1 mol AB to produce 3 mol hydrogen even experiencing six cycles, and reaction time of catalyze AB hydrolysis from the initial 4′40″ to the 5′38″ of the tenth round of experiments. This suggest the photocatalytic activity did not decrease significantly after ten cycles. Therefore, the Ru/β-SiC NWs have the perfect reusability in photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to hydrogen evolution."
9,Modification mechanism of Pt-Ru nanoclusters and photocatalytic AB hydrolysis mechanism,"3.4 Modification mechanism of Pt-Ru nanoclusters and photocatalytic AB hydrolysis mechanism Pt-Ru nanoclusters deposited on the β-SiC nanowires can modify the band structure of the β-SiC nanowires. To interpret the modification mechanism of Pt-Ru nanoclusters modify the band structure and photocatalytic properties of the β-SiC nanowires, some theoretical analysis and calculation were conducted via DFT. Fig. 9 depicts the electron density difference of the β-SiC, Pt/β-SiC and Ru/β-SiC. Fig. 9(a) and (b) reveal that the electrons conveyed from Si atom to C atom and finally formed the stable structure of the covalent compound. Fig. 9(c) and (d) depict the electron density difference nephogram of Pt, Ru atom adsorbed on the top position site of the C site. As the electron density difference nephogram shown, the electrons conveyed from Pt, Ru to carbon atom due to its metallicity, the received electron will alter the electronic distribution properties of the β-SiC and further modify the band structure of β-SiC. Figs. 10 and 11 depict band structure, TDOS and PDOS of pure β-SiC, Pt/β-SiC and Ru/β-SiC, respectively. The band gap calculation results show the pure β-SiC is a wide band gap semiconductor catalyst, and the band gap of the Pt/β-SiC and Ru/β-SiC are less than the pure β-SiC, this is in good agreement with the experimental results of Fig. 4. In addition, TDOS and PDOS of the Pt/β-SiC, Ru/β-SiC are calculated. As for the Pt/β-SiC, the electron density distribution of valence band increase are mainly caused by the orbital hybridizations of Pt-3d-orbitals and 4s-orbitals to the β-SiC in the energy level of the −4∼−1 eV, −6∼−3 eV, respectively. The conduction band increase is caused by the orbital hybridizations of the Pt-4p and 4s-orbitals, which account for the band gap of Pt/β-SiC decreases. Similarly, as for the Ru/β-SiC, electron orbitals of Ru-3d-orbitals contributed to the orbital hybridizations of the β-SiC in the energy level of −4∼−1 eV of the valence band, and 4s-orbitals and 4p-orbitals refer to the energy level of 1–2 eV, 2–4 eV of the conduction band, respectively. Base on the above analysis and previous literature [28], we believe that the band gap reduction mechanism of β-SiC is attributed to the modification effect of electron orbital hybridizations in Pt-Ru/β-SiC. Through the above-mentioned experiment studies, two types of reaction including photocatalytic AB hydrolysis and conventional metal catalyze AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen in Pt-Ru/β-SiC NWs catalytic AB hydrolysis reaction system were verified. This synergistic reaction system could enhance the efficiency of AB hydrolysis to hydrogen production significantly, and this internal reaction mechanism account for the increase of AB hydrolytic efficiency. To address the reaction mechanism of the Pt-Ru/β-SiC NWs catalytic AB hydrolysis system, a large number of literature researches and some experiments were carried out. As for the conventional metal catalytic AB hydrolysis, many researchers have confirmed it via dozens of experiments [29,30], and the main mechanism equations are shown in Eqs. (6)–(10). However, the photocatalytic AB hydrolysis mechanism have not been fully addressed, some researchers [31,32] proposed a possible mechanism of the photocatalytic AB hydrolysis by reference to the photocatalytic RhB degradation mechanism: photo-excited electrons e− reacted with dissolved O2 to form *O2 − first, then *O2 − reacted with H2O generate *OH, and finally *OH reacted with AB and H2O to produce H2. This possible mechanism emphasize the dissolved O2 in the water is involved in the reaction. To verify this, a photocatalytic AB hydrolysis experiment under the condition of O2 absence is designed, shown in Fig. 12 . Dissolved oxygen in water can be separated base on the Henry’s law. Specifically, before the photocatalytic AB hydrolysis reaction starts, high-purity nitrogen is continued infusion for 55 min until the oxygen is completely released from the water. Photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen at different operating conditions including different oxygen and light conditions are shown in Fig. 13 . The experiment results show no matter O2 presence or not in solution, approximately equal reaction rate are observed in photocatalytic AB hydrolysis reaction, this indicates the photocatalytic AB hydrolysis reaction have no connection with the dissolved O2. To further confirm this rules, we adopted Ru/β-SiC NWs to photocatalytic AB hydrolysis at the O2 absence condition. The specific operating conditions are as follows: in the first 3′30″, the reaction take place in the dark. Subsequently, the reaction system is moved to the light condition. The results show the reaction rate of photocatalytic AB hydrolysis in the light apparently higher than in the dark though at the condition of the O2 absence condition. This further confirms that the photocatalytic AB hydrolysis reaction doesn’t need O2 presence.

Therefore, the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic AB hydrolysis is different from the photocatalytic RhB or organic pollutant degradation. Based on the physical and chemical characteristics of AB and its photocatalytic hydrolysis properties, we summarized some general rules and proposed a possible mechanism of photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen, which shown in mechanism Eqs. (11)–(13). AB can form solids due to six dihydrogen bonds of one AB molecule, which attraction between the opposite charges of H+(N) and H−(B), N of NH3 express electronegative, which take electrons from its adjacent H(N). Meanwhile, B of BH3 express electropositive, release its electrons to the adjacent H(B). However, the BN bond of H3N-BH3(AB), its electronic structure can be described in Lewis structure [33–35], in this structure, NH3 of AB express partial positive charge( H 3 N ∗ + 2 ), and H3B of AB express negative charge( H 3 B ∗ - 2 ). This type of bonds created by the Lewis electronic structure is vulnerable compared with the stable ionic or covalent bond. Specifically, H 3 N ∗ + 2 can receive two photo-induced electron from the surface of the Pt-Ru/β-SiC composite NWs, on the other hand, H 3 B ∗ - 2 can release two electrons to neutralize photo-induced hole, and produce target products-hydrogen. The final reaction mechanism equation can be inferred as Eq. (14). The synergistic catalysis mechanism of AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen is depicted in Fig. 14 . The semiconductor photocatalyst Pt-Ru/β-SiC NWs, which synergistic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen due to AB can be photocatalyzed by photocatalysts Pt-Ru/β-SiC NWs and conventional catalyzed hydrolysis by the Pt-Ru nanoclusters of the Pt-Ru/β-SiC NWs. In addition, in the photocatalysts Pt-Ru/β-SiC NWs, Pt-Ru nanoclusters plays two roles, which not only tuned band structure of photocatalysts β-SiC NWs but also catalytic AB hydrolysis to hydrogen.

10,Conclusions,"The present work demonstrates the feasibility of using synergistic photocatalytic and conventional metal catalytic AB hydrolysis to rapid produce hydrogen in ambient temperature. The theoretical and experimental results show Pt-Ru nanoclusters deposited on the β-SiC nanowires modified the band structure and enhance the photocatalytic properties of the β-SiC nanowires, the band gap value of 2.36 eV(β-SiC NWs) reduce to 1.97 eV (Pt/β-SiC NWs) and 1.74 eV(Ru/β-SiC NWs), and the orbital hybridizations of Pt-3d-orbitals, 4s-orbitals and Ru-3d-orbitals, 4s-orbitals and 4p-orbitals to the β-SiC are account for the variation of band structure and band gap decrease. In the reaction of catalytic AB hydrolysis under the light irradiation, both Pt/β-SiC NWs and Ru/β-SiC NWs exhibit higher activity compared with the pure β-SiC NWs. More importantly, Pt-Ru/β-SiC NWs both obtained higher catalytic acitivity in the light irradiation condition compared with reaction in dark condition, the complete reaction required time decrease by 2′26″ and 4′12″, this explicit indicate that Pt-Ru/β-SiC NWs catalytic AB hydrolysis reaction system exists synergistic photocatalytic AB hydrolysis and conventional metal catalyze AB hydrolysis. In addition, the previous mechanism of AB photocatalytic hydrolysis which believes the reaction is related to the dissolved oxygen in the solution have proved to be inaccurate via demonstration experiment, and have proposed a newly possible mechanism of photocatalytic AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen base on the especial Lewis structure of AB."
