0,Introduction,"Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals has greatly attracted attention for establishing the sustainable society because of the renewability, abundance, and inedibility of the lignocellulose [1–3]. For the production of valuable chemicals from cellulose and hemicellulose, the use of woody biomass is desired because it can eliminate the competition against food and it grows densely per unit area of land. However, the highly crystalline cellulose is encapsulated in hemicellulose–lignin matrix in woody biomass; thus, severe reaction conditions are required for the utilization of cellulose and hemicellulose. Enzymatic saccharification or acid hydrolysis with a main aim of bioethanol production has been developed [4,5]; however, the process has not been operated on a large scale because of low reaction rate and high cost for enzymatic saccharification and low yield and complicated separation for acid hydrolysis. Recently, catalytic cellulose conversion to sorbitol by supported metal catalysts with hydrogen has been reported by some research groups [6–13]; however, the pure cellulose is generally produced from lignocellulose using a strong base and strong acid catalyst to remove the lignin and hemicellulose components completely. Then, direct catalytic conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose in woody biomass to valuable chemicals is highly desirable to open new possibility for the use of lignocellulosic biomass. Palkovits et al. reported that sorbitol, sorbitan, and isosorbide could be obtained from spruce chips using supported metal catalysts and sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid with 55% yield of sugar alcohols based on cellulose unit [14]. The use of mineral acid could not avoid problems of corrosion of reactor wall or neutralization processes for the removal of hazardous acid; thus, environmentally benign techniques should be applied for the biomass transformation, in which no hazardous materials are used or produced. Sels et al. also reported that several lignocellulosic biomass could be converted into sorbitan and isosorbide using a combination of a supported ruthenium catalyst and heteropoly acids and that the total yield of sorbitan and isosorbide was at most 15% based on carbon atom of lignocellulose [15]. So far, the acid catalysts were required for the direct conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to sugar alcohols and the yield was low without strong mineral acids. It was reported that arabitol could be obtained from sugar beet fiber with 83% yield based on hemicellulose unit [16]; however, the direct catalytic transformation of cellulose in lignocellulosic biomass remains a challenge. In this work, we have succeeded in direct conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose in wood chips to six-carbon (C6) and five-carbon (C5) sugar alcohols by supported platinum catalysts in water without any acid catalysts (Scheme 1 ). Without a delignification pretreatment by inorganic acid, the cellulose and hemicellulose in the wood chips were mostly converted to sugar alcohols (conversion 94%, yield 62%) and lignin could be obtained as solid after the reaction. This technique will open up an opportunity to convert hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin into useful chemicals using supported metal catalysts in a step-by-step procedure. The conversion of lignin into useful chemicals such as aromatics is still challenging."
1,Experimental,"Catalyst preparation and characterization are described in the Supporting Information. The wood chips were made of Japanese cedar, which was a typical softwood in Japan. The chips were used as a reactant with a size less than 2mm (Fig. S1), which were obtained by a crushing apparatus (Kitagawa Iron Works Co., Ltd., KDS Micronex KSS-2), and denoted as untreated wood chips. A part of the untreated wood chips were pulverized with a ball mill at 60rpm for 48h (Fig. S1) and denoted as milled wood chips. The conversion of wood chips was carried out in a batch reactor, which we described in exact detail in the Supporting Information [6,7]. The milled or untreated wood chips (0.324g), Pt/C catalyst (0.1–0.3g, typically 0.2g), and water (40g) were loaded in the reactor, then hydrogen gas (5MPa) was loaded in the reactor. The reactor was heated to 463K. The quantitative analysis of water-soluble products in the liquid fraction was conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography. The other water-soluble (WS) products defined in this manuscript were calculated from the amount of total organic carbon in the liquid fraction other than the amount of total carbon in sugar alcohols. The conversion of wood chips was evaluated from the weight of recovered solid materials after the reaction. The amounts of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the wood chips were determined according to the literature [17]. Briefly, the amount of holocellulose, which was sum of cellulose and hemicellulose, was defined as the insoluble in NaClO2 aqueous solution with dilute acetic acid at 348K. Cellulose was defined as the insoluble of the holocellulose in NaOH aqueous solution at 293K. The hemicellulose content was determined by subtracting the amount of cellulose from that of the holocellulose. Lignin was defined as the insoluble of the wood chips in H2SO4 aqueous solution at 293K. The sugar content in the holocellulose was analyzed according to the literature [18]. Briefly, the wood chips were hydrolyzed by the H2SO4 aqueous solution to dissolve sugar content in the holocellulose. The hydrolyzed solution was neutralized and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (JASCO, LC-2000 Plus HPLC) equipped with a refractive index detector (JASCO, RI-2031 Plus) and an Aminex HPX-87P column (Bio-Rad)."
2,Results and discussion,"The amounts (weight percentage) of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the wood chips were 40.9%, 24.8%, and 33.4%, respectively. The sugar content in the holocellulose (weight percentage based on the wood chips) was glucose 46.5%, mannose 8.8%, galactose 1.8%, and xylose 5.7%, respectively. Table 1 shows the product yields obtained from the conversion of Japanese cedar chips with 2mm size at 463K over the 2%Pt/C catalyst with 5MPa H2 for 8, 16, and 24h (characterization results of the wood chips and the Pt/C catalyst are shown in the Supporting Information, Fig. S2). The conversion of wood chips was evaluated from the weight of recovered solid materials after the reaction. Carbon balance was more than 97% under the conditions of Table 1. The product yield was calculated based on sugar content in the reactant wood chips as follows: Yield for sugar alcohol % = each sugar alcohol in product mol / sum of sugar in introduced wood chips mol × 100 . C6 sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (2.8%), mannitol (8.5%), and galactitol (1.7%), and C5 sugar alcohols such as xylitol (6.5%) and arabitol (2.4%) could be obtained at 8h directly from the wood chips, indicating that a part of hemicellulose and/or cellulose in the wood chips were converted directly into the sugar alcohols by hydrogenolysis. The selectivity of each sugar alcohol in the product sugar alcohols was sorbitol 12.8%, mannitol 38.8%, galactitol 7.8%, xylitol 29.7%, and arabitol 10.9%. The conversion of the wood chips increased with increasing reaction time and consequently the water-soluble (WS) products increased; however, the yield of total sugar alcohols reached a maximum value in 16h and then decreased. The product yield of C6 or C5 sugar alcohols was also calculated based on hexose or pentose in the reactant wood chips, respectively, as follows: Yield for C 6 sugar alcohol C 6 % = each C 6 sugar alcohol in product mol / sum of hexose in introduced wood chips mol × 100 . Yield for C 5 sugar alcohol C 5 % = each C 5 sugar alcohol in product mol / sum of pentose in introduced wood chips mol × 100 . The yields based on hexose or pentose content at 16h were sorbitol 5.5 C6%, mannitol 10.8 C6%, galactitol 2.1 C6%, xylitol 69.9 C5%, and arabitol 21.2 C5%. The pentose (xylose 5.7% and no arabinose) contained in the wood chips could be converted into C5 sugar alcohols (xylitol and arabitol) with more than 90 C5% yield in 16h, indicating that hemicellulose content in the wood chips could be converted into sugar alcohols more easily than cellulose in the wood chips. The yield of the total sugar alcohols decreased from 16 to 24h; on the other hand, the other water-soluble by-products such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerin, and erythritol increased, implying that the sugar alcohols were converted into the other water-soluble products [19]. The sugars such as glucose and xylose were not detected in the recovered solution. The pH of the recovered solution was 6.9, indicating that any organic acids would not be formed. We confirmed the stability of sugar alcohols under the reaction condition (Fig. 1 ) by treating the 0.02moldm−3 sugar alcohol solutions over 2%Pt/C with hydrogen in water. From Fig. 1, the recovery percentages of the corresponding sugar alcohols were 71.9–79.6% and isomerization of C6 sugar alcohols or C5 sugar alcohols proceeded within a small percent. The degradation of sugar alcohols into the other water-soluble products occurred at the percentage of 11.8–19.1%, which clearly showed that the yields of sugar alcohols decreased and the other water-soluble products increased in the reaction of the wood chips from 16 to 24h (Table 1). Under the conditions employed, the conversion of the unmilled wood chips with 2.0mm size was low (29.9% at 24h) and the yield of C6 sugar alcohol from the cellulose part was also low. Table 2 shows the product yields obtained from the conversion of milled wood chips at 463K over the 2%Pt/C catalyst with 5MPa H2 for 8, 16, and 24h. Carbon balance, which was estimated from recovered solid materials and total organic carbon in the liquid fraction, decreased from 92% for 8h to 85% for 24h, indicating that a small fraction of wood chips was converted into gaseous products. Carbon dioxide could be detected by gas chromatography; however, quantitative analysis of the gaseous products could not be carried out because of major quantity of reactant hydrogen gas. Sugar alcohols of sorbitol (15.4%), mannitol (9.1%), galactitol (1.7%), xylitol (5.4%), and arabitol (2.1%), of which total yield was 33.7%, were obtained at 8h. The yield of total sugar alcohols increased to 40.4% at 16h and reached a maximum value in 16h. The ball-milling pulverization pretreatment of wood chips enhanced the total sugar alcohol yield from 26.4% to 40.6% where the sorbitol yield was also increased drastically from 4.9% to 23.1% by the ball milling and the other sugar alcohol yields did not change significantly. Also, the conversion of wood chips was increased from 29.3% to 60.7% at 16h by the ball milling. These results implied that the ball-milling pretreatment enhances the conversion of the cellulose part in the wood chips into sorbitol. Pulverization of lignocellulosic biomass by ball-milling has been applied for the decrease of crystallinity of cellulose part [17]. It was reported that the ball-milling pulverization of cellulose powder enhanced the yield of sorbitol during the hydrogenolysis reaction because of the decrease of cellulose crystallinity [20]. The peak of (002) diffraction of crystalline cellulose at 22.6° was broadened by the ball-milling treatment of the wood chips (Fig. S3), indicating that cellulose crystallinity in the wood chips was decreased. Therefore, improvement of the sugar alcohols yield is due to the decrease of cellulose crystallinity. The wood chips were composed of cellulose (40.9%), hemicellulose (24.8%), and lignin (33.4%). The conversion of milled wood chips at 463K for 16h was 60.7%. Under the same reaction condition for hydrogenolysis of the milled cellulose, the conversion of cellulose was 87.0% (Table S1). Hemicellulose could be converted into sugar alcohols by hydrogenolysis at milder condition (428K) [16]. When 87.0% of cellulose and 100% of hemicellulose in the wood chips was converted and lignin was not converted, the conversion of the wood chip was calculated to be 61.3%, which was the similar value as the observed conversion (60.7%). Thus, we concluded that the obtained solid after the hydrogenolysis of milled wood chips was composed of mainly lignin and small amount of the unreacted cellulose. It is noteworthy that without chemical pretreatments most of the cellulose and hemicellulose parts in the wood chips were converted to valuable sugar alcohols; on the other hand, the lignin part could be obtained as solid after the reaction. The conversions of the unmilled and milled wood chips to water-soluble species were investigated over the catalyst support, carbon black BP2000, without platinum with 5MPa H2 for 16h at 463K and also carried out without any catalysts to understand the effects of the catalyst support and platinum (Table S2). The conversions of the wood chips over the BP2000 support were almost the same as those without any catalysts, implying that hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose in the wood chips to water-soluble sugars was caused by high-temperature liquid water. The conversions of wood chips over the Pt/C catalysts were almost the same as those over the BP2000 support, implying that effect of platinum on the solubility of wood chips was small. The reaction would proceed via (i) hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose to soluble sugars by high-temperature liquid water and (ii) hydrogenation of sugars to sugar alcohols by platinum and hydrogen. Pt loadings and catalyst amounts were also important for the enhancement of the sugar alcohol yield form the milled wood chips (Table 3 ). The total yield of sugar alcohols was increased from 40.6% to 53.8% by an increase of 2%Pt/C catalyst amount from 0.2 to 0.3g. On the other hand, the sugar alcohol yield over 0.1g of 4%Pt/C (25.7%) was lower than that over 0.2g of 2%Pt/C (40.6%) despite almost the same amount of Pt surface atoms. The total yield of sugar alcohols over 4%Pt/C increased with increasing catalyst amount and reached 62.0% using 0.3g of 4%Pt/C, in which product yields based on sugar content were sorbitol 40.4 C6%, mannitol 14.1 C6%, galactitol 2.6 C6%, xylitol 61.1 C5%, and arabitol 36.0 C5%. The selectivity of each sugar alcohol in the product was sorbitol 58.0%, mannitol 20.3%, galactitol 3.7%, xylitol 11.1%, and arabitol 6.9%. This technique will enable conversions of all carbon contents in woody biomass such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin into valuable chemicals using a supported metal catalyst in water via stepwise conversions. We will investigate next the lignin conversion into valuable aromatics using supported metal catalysts in water, which are residual solids in this manuscript, at a more severe condition."
3,Conclusions,We have succeeded in converting cellulose and hemicellulose in the wood chips into sugar alcohols with 94% conversion and 62% yield by supported platinum catalysts in water without any acid catalysts. It has been demonstrated that the direct catalytic conversion of wood chips is a powerful technique to covert lignocellulosic biomass to useful chemicals.
