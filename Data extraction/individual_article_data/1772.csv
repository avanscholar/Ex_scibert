0,Introduction,"Nowadays, generation of electrical energy by using of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) has been significantly taken into consideration because of its very low damaging environmental effects. The lack of fossil fuel resources, increasing requirement to energy sources because of fast growth of population in recent years, and the concerns about environment pollution all over the world, are some of the important reasons which cause to finding and developing new neat resources and methods for energy production. As mentioned above, generation of electrical energy by using of membrane fuel cells is one of the most impressive methods in this area. Generation of electrical energy by PEMFCs can lead to very low release of harmful material into environment [1]. Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells use from pure hydrogen gas as fuel. Because of drastic obstacles of H2 saving and its transport, on-board generation of this gas by the help of reforming process of simple alcohols and hydrocarbons has been remarkably taken into consideration [2–4]. Methanol as simplest alcohol because of some particular properties such as inexistence of carbon-carbon bond in its chemical structure, low temperature reforming process and high ratio of hydrogen to carbon (4:1), has very good capability to produce hydrogen gas through reforming process [5–7]. The reforming process of methanol can be conducted through 4 different paths: methanol decomposition (MD) [8,9], partial oxidation of methanol (POM) [10,11], oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM) [12–14] and steam reforming of methanol (SRM) [15–17]. Among these four routes, hydrogen is generated with the highest yield through SRM process and also with the lowermost content of CO production [18–20]. The following three principal reactions occur in the SRM process. Eqs. (1)–(3) are the basic reaction of reforming, dissociation of CH3OH and water gas shift (WGS) reaction respectively [21,22]: (1) C H 3 O H + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H = 49.7 kj / mol (2) C H 3 O H ↔ C O + 2 H 2 Δ H = 90.2 kj / mol (3) C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 Δ H = − 41.2 kj/mol As seen in the above main reactions, the products of SRM reaction include hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) gases. The presence and production of carbon monoxide causes to unfavorable efficacy upon the performance of the fuel cells, and therefore the quantity of CO should be very low. Along SRM process, the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) (Eq. (3)), plays main role in carbon monoxide production. The WGS is exothermic and thus the reverse route cannot proceed at low temperatures and carbon monoxide generation is very low. Hence, in order to H2 gas generation with slight content of CO, the role of catalyst to represent high activity particularly at low temperatures, is very significant in SRM catalytic reaction. On the other hand, in addition to high activity at low temperatures, the catalysts of SRM reaction must be capable to decrease selectivity of CO gas, especially at high temperatures [23,24]. Catalysts based on Cu and metals of group 8–10, are basic categories of catalysts of SRM reaction. As mentioned above, the catalysts of SRM reaction should have high activity at low temperatures and also low selectivity into CO production at high temperatures and in this point of view the copper-based catalysts display better performance in comparison with another group. The most common and commercial catalyst for use in SRM reaction is CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA). By applying some special procedures such as addition of different promoters and alteration of synthesis method, the efficiency of CZA catalyst can be amended [25–27]. Texture, surface morphology and eventually catalytic efficiency can be modified through perceptible improvements in important catalytic properties such as specific surface area, interaction among different components along with improved distribution and scattering of active sites in the synthesized sample as a consequence of utilizing appropriate synthesis procedures. There are some conventional methods in order to synthesize of the catalysts of SRM reaction like hydrothermal, oxalate gel coprecipitation, impregnation, homogeneous precipitation, coprecipitation and sol-gel [28–30]. In addition to utilizing proper synthesis methods and also suitable promoters, post treatment process including glow discharge plasma treatment and various calcination conditions can significantly affect and improve catalytic properties of the fabricated catalysts. The non-thermal plasma has wide range of applications in surface treatment of materials [31,32], energy storage materials [33], hydrogen generation [34] and catalyst synthesis methods [35,36]. Glow discharge plasma (GDP) is a type of non-thermal plasma (NTP) which is applied as exquisite post treatment procedure for texture modification of the prepared catalysts before calcination [37]. Plasma is formed of many charged particles, free radicals, photons, electrons and atoms. In order to develop glow discharge plasma, two electrodes must be inserted into glass tube and then growing voltage difference should be applied across these electrodes. As a result, the current abruptly increments strongly and if the tube pressure is down enough about some Torrs as well as the outside circuit has great current resistance, glow discharge plasma develops. Crystallography properties, structure, surficial texture and morphology, particles size dispensation, surface elements scattering and eventually specific surface area of the prepared catalysts can be considerably modified by utilizing non-thermal glow discharge plasma (NTGDP) [38,39]. In the case of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts for SRM reaction, post treatment with NTGDP causes to superior scattering of various metallic crystallites, useful interplay among diverse metallic oxides, rather monotonous distribution of tiny particles, preferable scattering of different elements and eventually superior specific surface area in the treated catalysts. Such modifications and improvements in physicochemical specifications of the catalysts lead to superior activity of them in terms of higher CH3OH transformation at down temperatures in order to hydrogen gas production with little content of CO. In this research work, hydrothermal and oxalate gel coprecipitation preparation methods have been used to synthesize CZA samples with the purpose of comparison the influences of using various methods in the efficiency of the prepared samples in SRM reaction. After the comparison of two different synthesis procedures, the efficacy of NTGDP upon the physicochemical specifications and efficiency of the prepared sample via oxalate gel coprecipitation method has also been investigated in this work. Great difference of the performance of the nanocatalysts which are prepared via various fabrication procedures in the present work, and also the better efficiency of glow discharge plasma treated sample can be attributed to great improvements in physicochemical specifications of the nanocatalysts arising from the use of oxalate gel coprecipitation synthesis method and treatment by NTGDP. In this research, the physicochemical characterization of the prepared nanocatalysts are investigated via XRD, FESEM, PSD, AFM, TEM, EDX, BET and FTIR techniques. On the other hand, deactivation study of the used sample in SRM reaction which has been synthesized via gel oxalate precipitation method and modified via NTGDP, is performed through TG/DTG, SEM-EDX and AFM analysis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In the present research, the precursors of copper, zinc and aluminum, are analytical grade of copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu (NO3)2·3H2O), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn (NO3)2·6H2O), and aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al (NO3)3·9H2O), respectively. Likewise, NaOH and oxalic acid dihydrate (HO2CCO2H·2H2O) are used as precipitation and gelation agents in hydrothermal and oxalate gel coprecipitation synthesis methods respectively. Again, C2H5OH is applied as solvent for procurement of alcoholic dilution of materials and HO2CCO2H·2H2O. Furthermore, we use CH3OH as feed in SRM reaction. All mentioned substances are supplied and purchased from Merck. Moreover, Argon gas is used in order to formation of plasma. This high purity Argon is supplied from Technical Gas Service in Ajman, UAE."
3,Nanocatalysts preparation and procedure,"2.2 Nanocatalysts preparation and procedure Schematic fabrication steps of CZA nanocatalyst via hydrothermal method are depicted in Fig. 1S. As shown in this figure, there are three stages in hydrothermal preparation method. Firstly, 1 M aqueous solution of proper amounts of Cu, Zn and Al nitrate precursors is made to synthesize of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst. The weight percentages of CuO, ZnO and Al2O3 in the prepared catalyst are 45, 45 and 10, respectively. Also, in the first stage, an aqueous solution of NaOH is made. The content of NaOH is three times more than the nitrate ions. After the addition of aqueous solution of NaOH to 1 M aqueous dilution of nitrate precursors, the obtained solution is blended 20 min in 500 rotation per minute. At the next stage, hydrothermal synthesis is performed in a stainless-steel autoclave for 9 h at 180 °C. Post treatment process is the third stage of hydrothermal synthesis method. In this stage, firstly, the blend which has been obtained from prior stage is rinsed by deionized water till PH = 7. After that the blend is dried in the oven at 110 °C for 16 h in airstream. Then, calcination is done at 350 °C for 5 h in the same ambient. Eventually, in order to use of fabricated catalyst in the reactor of SRM reaction, the obtained powder is shaped via Plexiglas sheet. Dimensions of cylindrical catalyst are 3.5 mm in height and 1 mm in diameter. The CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst which is fabricated via hydrothermal procedure is denoted as CZA-HT. Moreover, synthesis process of CZA sample by oxalate gel coprecipitation and glow discharge plasma-assisted oxalate gel coprecipitation method is illustrated in Fig. 2S. As seen in this figure, there are three stages in gel oxalate precipitation synthesis procedure. Firstly, in order to preparation of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst, 1 M solution of proper values of nitrate precursors in C2H5OH is created according to weight percentages of CuO, ZnO and Al2O3 which are 45, 45 and 10, respectively. Furthermore, at the first stage, one Molal dilution of HO2CCO2H·2H2O in C2H5OH is also created. At the next step of this stage, 1 m dilution of HO2CCO2H·2H2O is appended dropwise to 1 M dilution of precursors under persistent mixing while the blend of precursors has been placed in ice water bath at 0 °C. Dropwise addition of 1 m dilution of HO2CCO2H·2H2O continues until a suspension is gained. At the second stage, prepared suspension is heated until 70 °C to vaporize additional ethanol and as a result of this process, mixture of oxalate salt of different precursors which is similar to gel-like blend, is obtained. But, about the final stage, three steps of post treatment process are done in this stage. Firstly, the obtained gel-like blend is dried at 110 °C for 12 h in air flow. Considerable volume of shrinkage is observed in the gel mixture during drying process. After this, the obtained nanocatalyst powder is located in the furnace at air atmosphere and programmed calcination is carried out. For the purpose of programmed calcination, the temperature is kept fixed for 1 h at 150, 200, 250, 300 °C and eventually 4 h at 350 °C. Increasing of temperature between each step is performed with fixed heating ramp (5 °C/min). On the other hand, the fixed cooling ramp with the rate of 10 °C/min is used to cool down the furnace at the end of calcination procedure. At the final step, shaping of the nanocatalyst powder to tiny cylindrical particles is done via reticulated Plexiglas plate in order to preparation of catalyst for use in the reactor of SRM reaction. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2S, in order to fabrication of plasma treated sample in the plasma route, dried powder of the nanocatalyst before calcination step, must be subjected under NTGDP. Treatment via GDP is repeated thrice for 15 min in 1000 V for the purpose of obtaining monotonous treated powder. A real image and a flow diagram of the experimental setup of NTGDP are represented in Fig. 3S in Supplementary material. Plasma treatment procedure begins via loading a slim substrate of the nanocatalyst with proximate weight about 0.2 g on a Quartz plate. The dimensions of this plate are 6 cm in length and 3.5 cm in width. After loading of sample, the mentioned plate is placed in plasma chamber in adjacency of anode electrode which the effective positive column zone of GDP is appeared in this area. The height and diameter of Pyrex plasma chamber are 20 and 5 cm respectively. After that, high purity Argon gas is used as plasma forming gas. Along the plasma treatment procedure, Apex mass flow controller is applied in order to inject Argon gas with fixed rate of 20 cm3/min into plasma chamber. Then the tube is discharged via Pfeiffer vacuum pump to a pressure about one Torr. Finally, voltage difference about 1000 V is exerted between cathode and anode electrodes with the help of high voltage DC generator, and in this way favorite NTGDP is appeared in the Pyrex tube. The CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst which is fabricated via oxalate gel coprecipitation synthesis procedure is denoted as CZA-OG and also the portion of this sample which is treated by plasma is defined as CZA-OG-P."
4,Nanocatalysts characterization techniques,"2.3 Nanocatalysts characterization techniques D-5000 Siemens X-ray diffractometer is applied in order to obtain X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and crystallography features of the prepared samples. Scanning of the synthesized nanocatalysts is performed in the range of 2θ = 20–90° by the mentioned instrument through Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154056 nm) joined to an X-ray tube which acts at 30 kV and 40 mA. Formation of various crystallite phases and the relation of them to the existence of different metal oxides, are confirmed via collation of acquired XRD diffraction patterns with standard diffraction peaks of compounds in JCPDS. Investigations about morphology, surface texture and particles size dispensation of the prepared nanocatalysts are done via Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) technique with the help of HITACHI S-4160 analyzer. In order to more accurate study with more details about surficial texture and morphology, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis is used with the help of JEOL‐JEM‐2010 (JEOL, Japan) device which operates at 200 kV. Dispersion on the surface and the properties of different surficial elements are specified by Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The instrument which is applied to accomplish EDX analysis is VEGA II, TESCAN, EDX analyser. In this research work, Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 analyser is used in order to measure the specific surface area of the synthesized samples through N2 gas adsorption technique. The specific surface area calculations are carried out by BET equation. On the other hand, Unicam 4000 FTIR spectrometer is applied to determine functional groups on the surface of various samples via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis in the wavenumber range of 400−4000 cm−1 with employing KBr plate. Finally, Thermo-gravimetric (TG) analysis is performed for used sample in SRM reaction utilizing Pyris Diamond analyzer in order to obtain graph of weight loss which relates to decomposition of water, coke and some other carbonaceous compounds."
5,Experimental setup for catalytic performance test,"2.4 Experimental setup for catalytic performance test The experimental setup which is shown in Fig. 4S in Supplementary material, is applied for evaluation the efficiency of fabricated nanocatalysts in SRM reaction. The U-shape catalytic reactor with 5 mm inner diameter is placed in the furnace with ability to provide different reaction temperatures from 160 to 300 °C. The value of nanocatalysts loading in the Pyrex reactor in order to start a batch is 400 × 10−3g. Before starting the process, the nanocatalysts which are loaded in the reactor are reduced with the help of gas stream with volume percent of H2/Ar 15 %. The flow rate of the reducing gas is 100 cm3/min and in this way, the reduction process is performed for 3 h at 300 °C. The blend of CH3OH and H2O with the ratio of (1:4) in the first saturator is used as feed of SRM reaction. This saturator is placed in water ice bath at 0 °C and a flow of Argon gas is arrived to this saturator and in this way, vapor mixture of CH3OH and H2O is transported to the second vacant saturator. At the next step, outgoing gas flow from second saturator is arrived into the reactor of SRM reaction. Within the test the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) should be constant and equal to 10,000 cm3/gcat.h, Therefore, with the help of MFC, flow rate of Argon is adjusted at 66.7 cm3/min. After the SRM catalytic reaction in fixed bed reactor, the composition of outgoing gas flow from the reactor which includes the residual CH3OH and produced H2, CO2 and CO gases is excavated via gas chromatograph apparatus (GC Chrom, Teif Gostar Faraz, Iran). PLOT-U column (Agilent) is utilized in GC due to the kind of feed and generated gases in SRM reaction. This column is capable to detach different produced gases in SRM reaction. The detection of various gases is carried out by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID) which are employed in gas chromatography apparatus. Hydrogen gas detection is done by TCD and on the other hand, the detection of CH3OH, CO2 and CO gases even with very low content, is performed via FID detector along with a methanizer reactor. Carbon balance calculations show that the quantity of this parameter is almost equal to 98 % or even more. The calculations for obtain the value of CH3OH transformation and selectivity into various products are performed through the following relations: (4) X C H 3 O H % = F C H 3 O H i n − F C H 3 O H o u t F C H 3 O H i n × 100 (5) S H 2 % = F H 2 o u t F H 2 o u t + F C O o u t + F C O 2 o u t × 100 (6) S C O % = F C O o u t F H 2 o u t + F C O o u t + F C O 2 o u t × 100 (7) S C O 2 % = F C O 2 o u t F H 2 o u t + F C O o u t + F C O 2 o u t × 100 Where Fi and Si are flow rate and selectivity of component i in the outgoing flow from the reactor respectively."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Nanocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Nanocatalysts characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD diffraction patterns of the prepared samples via hydrothermal and oxalate gel coprecipitation methods at 2θ = 20-90°. Also, the diffraction patterns of glow discharge plasma treated nanocatalyst which has been fabricated via gel oxalate precipitation procedure is displayed in this figure. The considerable diffraction peaks at 2θ = 35.5, 35.6, 38.8, 38.9, 48.8, 61.6, 68.2° are devoted to monoclinic phase of CuO (JCPDS 01-080-1268). On the other hand, hexagonal phase of ZnO (JCPDS 01-089-0510) demonstrates remarkable refraction peaks at 2θ = 31.8, 34.4, 36.3, 47.6, 56.6, 62.9, 68.0, 69.1°. Moreover, because of low loading, high dispersion or amorphous phase of Al2O3 which is an outcome of mild calcination conditions, there are no remarkable diffraction peaks for Al2O3. Also, as seen in the Fig. 1, it is clear that there are no recognizable diffraction peaks for ZnAl2O4 and CuAl2O4 spinels and this subject can be due to high formation temperature (above 500 °C) of these compounds. Overlap of CuO refraction peak at 2θ = 35.6° and ZnO diffraction peak at 2θ = 36.3° is clear in Fig. 1. As seen in the XRD diffraction patterns, the strong refraction peak at 2θ = 38.8° is assigned to CuO (1 1 1) crystallite plate. Investigations about the mechanism of SRM reaction demonstrate that Cu (1 1 1) is the most active copper crystallite facet to adsorb CH3OH and several other mediators [21,22,40]. In fact, Cu (1 1 1) facet as well as different ZnO crystallite facets play important role in SRM reaction. For instance, various compounds such as methanol, water, CO2 and CO can be adsorbed by ZnO (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) crystallite plates. So, on the basis of above explanation, improved catalytic efficiency of the catalysts of SRM reaction, can be obtained through high scattering of CuO and ZnO crystallite facets. More intensity of the same XRD diffraction peaks in CZA-HT sample compared with CZA-OG nanocatalyst can be seen in Fig. 1. On the other hand, it is clear that the width of the same XRD diffraction peaks which are related to identical crystallite facets of various metallic oxides, is broader in CZA-OG compared with CZA-HT catalyst. So, notable increment in crystallinity and crystallite size of different crystallite plates can be understood in the nanocatalyst which is fabricated by hydrothermal method compared with the sample which is fabricated via oxalate gel coprecipitation method, based on the comparison of intensity and width of identical XRD diffraction peaks in CZA-HT and CZA-OG samples. Low scattering of various metallic oxides crystallite facets, is the most important consequence of strong increment in crystallinity and crystallite size of different crystallite plates in CZA-HT sample compared with the CZA-OG nanocatalyst. The comparative discussion about XRD diffraction patterns of CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P samples indicates that lower intensity and broader peaks can be obtained through non-thermal plasma treatment of CZA-OG sample. Therefore, the being of the properties such as lower intensity and broader peaks in CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst which are the results of non-thermal plasma treatment, can lead to decrease in crystallinity and crystallite size of different plates of metallic oxides in this sample. So, higher scattering of various crystallite facets of metallic oxides can be obtained by applying NTGDP. Crystallographic features of the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalysts which have been fabricated via different synthesis procedures are demonstrated in Table 1 . Scherrer equation is applied in order to calculate the crystallite size of CuO and ZnO crystallite plates. Computed and presented crystallographic features in Table 1 corroborate the above qualitative statements about crystallinity and crystallite size of different metallic oxides plates. Table 1 shows that the lowest relative crystallinity and crystallite size of different facets are obtained for CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst. As mentioned above, higher and better scattering of various metallic oxides crystallite facets are the results of decrement in crystallinity and crystallite size. The performance of the catalysts in SRM reaction can be modified by using nanocatalysts with higher scattering of Cu and Zn oxides crystallite facets. Among various plates, CuO (1 1 1) which is converted to Cu (1 1 1) through reduction process is a very important crystallite plate and therefore, higher dispersion of this facet can lead to superior performance of catalyst in SRM reaction. So, considering the all above descriptions, better performance for CZA-OG in comparison with CZA-HT sample and also, the best efficiency for CZA-OG-P in comparison with the other nanocatalysts for provide higher transformation of CH3OH and superior selectivity to favorable products in SRM reaction, are expected. 3.1.2 FESEM analysis FESEM images of the prepared samples via hydrothermal and gel oxalate precipitation synthesis procedures are shown in Fig. 2 . Also, FESEM images of the sample which has been synthesized via gel oxalate precipitation procedure and modified via NTGDP are depicted in this figure. Research about morphology, surface texture and proximate evaluation of particles size dispensation for synthesized nanocatalysts are performed through FESEM analysis. A suitable catalyst for use in SRM reaction and also in the all other catalytic reactions should have some special surficial morphology and texture properties such as small particles size, low aggregation of particles, monotonous distribution of particles and narrow size dispensation of particles. The existence of above mentioned appropriate surficial texture features in the prepared catalysts can cause to facile attainment of various reactants to metallic active crystallite facets and in this way the transformation of CH3OH and selectivity to favorable products can be improved in SRM. The existence of particles with the size in nanometric scale in all three prepared samples is clear from FESEM images. As seen in the Fig. 2, CZA-HT sample has a lot of agglomerated particles. The comparison of FESEM images of CZA-HT and CZA-OG nanocatalysts demonstrates that applying oxalate gel coprecipitation synthesis method leads to lesser particles size, less aggregation and more monotonous distribution of particles in CZA-OG sample. Moreover, comparative discussion about surficial texture properties of CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P samples shows that NTGDP causes to superior surficial morphology and texture features in CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst so that this sample has the tiniest particles size, lowermost aggregation of particles, the most monotonous dispensation of particles and finally the narrowest size distribution among all three synthesized samples. Considering the all explanations, as mentioned above, better surficial texture properties in the prepared nanocatalyst can lead to extensive access of different reactants to metal active crystallite plates and this facile and extensive achievement of reactants, plays very important role in steam reforming of methanol reaction. Therefore, better performance for CZA-OG in comparison with CZA-HT sample and also the best performance for CZA-OG-P in comparison with the other two nanocatalysts in terms of higher transformation of CH3OH and premier selectivity to desirable products in steam reforming of methanol reaction, are predictable. A histogram of surficial particles size of CZA-OG-P sample is represented in Fig. 3 . Statistic dispensation, maximum, minimum and average particles size of CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst can be specified by using ImageJ software and FESEM image of this sample. It can be seen in Fig. 3 that minimum, maximum and average particles size of CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst are 6.3, 46.7 and 20.1 nm, respectively. Fig. 4 displays overview of 3D surface analysis of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst fabricated via various methods. Overview of 3D surface analysis of various prepared samples can be used in order to investigate about topography, roughness and some other special surficial texture properties such as pitches and protrusions of the synthesized samples. As seen in Fig. 4, root mean square (RMS), average height and maximum height of the fabricated nanocatalysts have been calculated and depicted in this figure. The RMS parameter is calculated and applied in order to demonstrate the surficial roughness of different samples. Based on the calculated parameters such as RMS, average and maximum height for different nanocatalysts and through the comparison of these parameters for three synthesized samples, it is determined that the sample which is fabricated via hydrothermal method has the most inappropriate and non-uniform surficial texture properties and topography among prepared nanocatalysts. Also, as can be seen in Fig. 4, average height, maximum height and RMS parameters for CZA-OG-P sample are 27.7, 50 and 14.3 nm, respectively. On the other hand, through comparative discussion about the results, it is determined that the CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst which is synthesized via gel oxalate precipitation procedure and modified via NTGDP, has the lowest average height, maximum height and RMS parameters in comparison with the two other samples and in this way the CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst possesses the most appropriate and uniform surficial texture features and topography among other samples. As mentioned about FESEM analysis, these appropriate and uniform surficial texture properties of the CZA-OG-P sample which are also approved via the results of 3D surface analysis, lead to extensive access of different reactants to metal active crystallite plates and in this way the best efficiency for CZA-OG-P in comparison with the other nanocatalysts in SRM reaction, is expected. 3.1.3 TEM analysis As said earlier in the outcomes of FESEM analysis, the CZA-OG-P sample which has been synthesized via gel oxalate precipitation procedure and modified via NTGDP, has the best surficial texture and morphological properties in comparison with the other two nanocatalysts, so that this sample possesses the tiniest particles size, lowermost aggregation of particles, the most monotonous dispensation of particles and finally the narrowest size distribution among all three prepared samples. In this way, TEM analysis is used in order to more accurate study and investigation with more details about surficial texture and morphology of the CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst. Fig. 5 represents obtained TEM images from CZA-OG-P sample. As can be seen in this figure, all above mentioned surficial texture and morphological properties for CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst are also approved by TEM images of this sample. The existence of these amazing surficial properties can cause to broad and wide access of various reactants to metal active crystallite facets. So, the best performance for CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst compared with the other two samples in SRM reaction, is predictable. 3.1.4 EDX analysis Fig. 6 displays the results of Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the fabricated samples via hydrothermal and gel oxalate precipitation synthesis procedures. Also, EDX analysis of the sample which is prepared via gel oxalate precipitation synthesis procedure and modified via NTGDP is illustrated in this figure. Dispersion on the surface and the situation of different surficial elements, surficial chemical analysis and finally the weight percentages of various surficial elements of the synthesized nanocatalysts are determined through EDX analysis. As mentioned in the description of XRD analysis, while Al (NO3)3·9H2O precursor has been utilized in the preparation procedure of the nanocatalysts but, there are no significant refraction peaks for Al2O3 in XRD diffraction patterns of all three prepared samples. In this special circumstance, the being of the all elements which have been used in previous stages on the surface of the prepared samples, can be confirmed via the results of EDX analysis. The absence of any sintering and agglomeration of particles as well as monotonous scattering of different surface elements in the fabricated samples can be understood from EDX dot-mapping micrographs. Fig. 6 also shows the comparison between the weight percentages of different elements in preliminary solution and the weight percentages of these elements on the surface of each synthesized nanocatalyst. More monotonous dispersion of different elements as well as less difference between weight percentages of various elements in preliminary solution and final sample for the nanocatalyst which has been fabricated by gel oxalate precipitation procedure are indicated through comparative discussion about EDX spectra and dot-mapping micrographs of CZA-HT and CZA-OG nanocatalysts along with the comparative study of weight percentages of various elements in preliminary solution and final sample for these two nanocatalysts. On the other hand, the comparison of the dispersion on the surface and the situation of different surficial elements in CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P samples through EDX analysis, demonstrates that NTGDP leads to better surficial elemental properties in CZA-OG-P sample. Therefore, this nanocatalyst possesses the most monotonous scattering of surficial elements and the least discrepancy between weight percentages of various elements in preliminary solution and final sample among all three fabricated nanocatalysts. Thus, considering all above descriptions, better efficiency for CZA-OG in comparison with CZA-HT sample as well as the best efficiency for CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst in comparison with the two other samples for supplying premier CH3OH transformation and superior selectivity into proper products in SRM reaction, are anticipated. 3.1.5 BET analysis Beginning step of every catalytic chemical reaction by heterogeneous catalysts, is the adsorption of various reactants on metal active crystallite facets and this phenomenon plays an essential role in all catalytic chemical reactions. In this regard, heterogeneous catalyst with higher specific surface area possesses more metal active crystallite plates in order to adsorption of diverse reactants. Dissociation of the chemical bonds of various reactants, is the next step in the path to perform catalytic chemical reaction. After adsorption of diverse reactants and dissociation of their chemical bonds, different mediators and eventually the final products of the chemical reaction are generated through formation of new chemical bonds. Specific surface area of the prepared nanocatalysts with hydrothermal and gel oxalate precipitation synthesis procedures is illustrated in Table 1. Also, measured specific surface area of the nanocatalyst which has been synthesized via gel oxalate precipitation synthesis procedure and modified via NTGDP is represented in this table. Nitrogen gas adsorption technique along with BET equation are applied in order to measure and calculate specific surface area of different samples. It can be seen in Table 1 that the measured specific surface area for CZA-HT, CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P nanocatalysts are 18.5, 63.8 and 84.3 m2/g respectively. The comparison between calculated specific surface area of CZA-HT and CZA-OG samples indicates that the sample which has been fabricated via gel oxalate precipitation procedure, possesses superior specific surface area. On the other hand, the comparison of the measured specific surface area of CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P nanocatalysts displays that NTGDP leads to higher specific surface area for CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst so that this sample has the greatest specific surface area among all three prepared nanocatalysts. As mentioned in FESEM analysis section, the properties such as smaller particles size, lower agglomeration of particles, more monotonous distribution of particles and narrower size distribution can lead to superior surficial morphology and texture features in the prepared sample. These better surficial morphology and texture properties can cause to higher specific surface area in the synthesized nanocatalyst. Thus, higher specific surface area for CZA-OG in comparison with CZA-HT sample as well as the highest specific surface area for CZA-OG-P among all three fabricated samples, are expected considering the results of FESEM analysis. So, the obtained results from BET analysis and the interpretations of FESEM images have good consistency together. Therefore, with regard to all above statements, better performance for CZA-OG in comparison with CZA-HT sample and also the best efficiency for CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst compared with the other two nanocatalysts in terms of premier CH3OH transformation and superior selectivity into desired products in methanol steam reforming reaction, are predictable. 3.1.6 FTIR analysis The results of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis of the synthesized samples via hydrothermal and gel oxalate precipitation procedures as well as FTIR spectrum of the nanocatalyst which has been fabricated with gel oxalate precipitation procedure and modified via NTGDP are illustrated in Fig. 7 . As seen in the figure, the spectroscopy of FTIR analysis has been performed in broad wavenumber range. Precise evaluation of the functional groups on the surface of the prepared samples is the most important reason for choosing a wide wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm−1. The being of approximately similar absorption peaks is obvious through the comparison of FTIR spectrums of CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P nanocatalysts. This is explicated via the being of the identical surface functional groups in the both NTGDP modified and unmodified samples. The vibration frequencies which are allocated to metallic oxides bonds are in the range of 400−900 cm−1. For example, the vibration bands of zinc and copper oxide can represent the absorption peaks at 460 and 495 cm-1 wavenumbers respectively. On the other hand, Al2O3 is distinguished via the characteristic absorption peak at around 550 cm−1. Moreover, aluminum-oxygen bonds in the prepared samples can display an absorption peak at around 700 cm-1 wavenumbers. The stretching vibration frequencies at 1430, 1590, 1660 and 3450 cm−1 are assigned to OH groups [41,42]. Additionally, the water molecules that can be remained in the various layers of the fabricated nanocatalysts during various stages of the preparation method can exhibit absorption band in about 1660 cm-1 wavenumber [35,43]. The water molecules which are adsorbed physically in the synthesized samples after calcination step, can show vibration bands at about 1430, 1590 and 3450 cm−1 wavenumbers."
8,Non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment mechanism,"3.2 Non-thermal glow discharge plasma treatment mechanism Various types of plasma commonly are categorized into high temperature or fusion plasma and low temperature or gas discharge plasma. Neutral species, electrons and ions which are the main components of high temperature plasma, are usually in thermal balance condition. But, about low temperature plasma, this kind includes thermal plasma (TP) and non-thermal plasma (NTP). Because of the existence of local thermal balance condition in thermal plasma, this kind is generally denominated as quasi-equilibrium plasma. On the other hand, non-thermal plasma is usually named as cold or non-equilibrium plasma. The difference between the temperature of bulk gas and the temperature of electrons can be mentioned as the most important difference between thermal plasma and non-thermal plasma. In order to clarify this issue, the temperature of bulk gas and the temperature of electrons has no sensible difference in thermal plasma. But, in non-thermal plasma the bulk gas is approximately at room temperature while the temperature of electrons is significantly higher than the temperature of bulk gas and can reach to 104–105 K. So, considering all above descriptions, low bulk gas temperature, non-balance nature from the point of thermodynamic and high selectivity are some of the special properties of non-thermal plasma which can cause to extensive use of this treatment process in a lot of various scientific fields. In the issue of heterogeneous catalysts, non-thermal plasma can be applied in order to improve surficial morphology and texture properties of the prepared nanocatalysts. Glow discharge is one of the most important and applicable kind of non-thermal plasma which is extensively used in plasma chemistry applications [44–46]. In this research work, improvement of surficial morphology and texture properties of the synthesized nanocatalysts is performed through NTGDP treatment, before applying them in SRM reaction. As already mentioned, a real image and a flow diagram of the experimental setup of NTGDP technology which is used in treatment process of the nanocatalysts, are represented in Fig. 3S in Supplementary material. Some dried powder of the prepared nanocatalyst is loaded on the Quartz plate and then this plate is located in the plasma tube in abutment of the anode electrode. After that, pure Argon gas is transferred to Pyrex chamber with fix injection rate of 20 cm3/min. Then the plasma tube is discharged via Pfeiffer vacuum pump to a pressure about 1 Torr. Finally, with the help of a high voltage DC generator, the voltage about 1000 V is exerted between cathode and anode electrodes and in this way favorite NTGDP is appeared into Pyrex tube. In this situation, density of current, electrical field and also the density of electrons and ions are constant in the positive column area which is generated in vicinity of anode electrode in the Pyrex tube. Because of the mentioned special properties of the positive column area, in order to treatment and improvement of the surficial morphology and texture properties of the fabricated sample, the Quartz plate with slim substrate of nanocatalyst powder is placed in this zone. Flow of electrons from cathode to anode electrode as well as an electrical field are formed as a consequence of exerting high voltage between these two electrodes. By locating nanocatalyst powder which is loaded on the Quartz plate, in the positive column zone of the plasma chamber, a lot of electrons can be captured by each nanocatalyst particle and in this way each particle of the nanocatalyst powder has the role of electron sink in this process. Trapping of the electrons in the nanocatalyst particles can cause to substantial decrement in the density of electrons in the environment of NTGDP. Formation of plasma sheath around the particles by the electrons which are trapped in particles of nanocatalyst can cause to potent repellent forces between the current electrons and plasma sheath. So, these powerful repulsive effects, exert strong forces on the plasma sheath which these forces are also transmitted to the particles of the nanocatalyst. The repulsive effects between the electrons which are trapped inside the structure of the particles can be mentioned as another repulsive forces alongside the repellent forces between current electrons and plasma sheath. Therefore, the bonds of precursors and clusters are elongated or distorted because of the impressive effects of the above mentioned inner and exterior repulsive forces. These events can lead to notable reduction of the amount of sintered and agglomerated particles in the samples which are modified by NTGDP [47]. Thus, improvement and modification of some special properties of the fabricated samples such as crystallography features, morphology, surface texture and particles size distribution, scattering on the surface and eventually specific surface area, can be carried out through NTGDP treatment."
9,Catalytic performance study toward hydrogen production from CH3OH/H2O mixture,"3.3 Catalytic performance study toward hydrogen production from CH3OH/H2O mixture 3.3.1 Methanol conversion The results of methanol conversion for various fabricated samples are demonstrated in Fig. 8 . As seen in this figure, the reaction temperature varies from 160 to 300 °C. It is obvious via the comparison of the amount of transformation of CH3OH for CZA-HT and CZA-OG nanocatalysts that the sample which is fabricated via gel oxalate precipitation procedure has significantly higher conversion of methanol in all various temperatures. Also, it can be seen that CZA-HT sample has no amount of methanol conversion at 160 °C while the value of methanol transformation for CZA-OG nanocatalyst at the same temperature, is about 40 %. On the other hand, it is evident through the comparison of obtained methanol conversion for CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P samples that NTGDP leads to higher transformation of methanol for CZA-OG-P sample so that this nanocatalyst possesses the highest CH3OH conversion at different temperatures among all three fabricated samples. It is obvious in Fig. 8, that the value of transformation of CH3OH for CZA-OG-P sample at 200 °C, is about 100 %. As mentioned in the results of various physicochemical analysis, because of better and more favorable physicochemical characterization of CZA-OG compared with CZA-HT sample in terms of higher and better scattering of different metallic oxides crystallite facets, smaller particles size, less aggregation of particles, more monotonous dispensation of particles, narrower size distribution, more appropriate topography and surficial texture features, more monotonous scattering of surficial elements and eventually superior specific surface area which are corroborated via XRD, FESEM, PSD, AFM, TEM, EDX and BET analysis, superior performance for CZA-OG compared with CZA-HT is expected in steam reforming of methanol reaction in order to supply premier transformation of CH3OH. On the other hand, forasmuch as CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst has the best and most favorable physicochemical characterization among all three fabricated nanocatalysts in terms of the highest and best scattering of different metallic oxides crystallite facets, the tiniest particles size, the lowermost aggregation of particles, the most monotonous dispensation of particles, the narrowest size distribution, the most appropriate topography and surficial texture features, the most monotonous scattering of surficial elements and eventually the highest specific surface area which are approved via XRD, FESEM, PSD, AFM, TEM, EDX and BET analysis, the best efficiency for CZA-OG-P sample compared with the other two prepared nanocatalysts is anticipated in SRM reaction to provide the highest conversion of methanol. So, with considering all above statements, the results of different physicochemical characterization analysis and the obtained amount for transformation of CH3OH for various fabricated nanocatalysts in methanol steam reforming reaction, have proper consistency together. 3.3.2 Products selectivity As seen in Fig. 9 , H2, CO2 and CO gases are the principal products of SRM reaction which are generated through using of different prepared nanocatalysts in this reaction. Moreover, the amount of generated H2, CO2 and CO for each sample in the temperature range from 160 to 300 °C are represented in this figure. It is obvious from Fig. 9 that among the generated products of SRM reaction, hydrogen gas has the highest amount at every temperature for all three fabricated samples and after that, CO2 is produced more than CO gas. As seen in the figure, forasmuch as CZA-HT sample has no methanol conversion at 160 °C, selectivity to different products is not reported for this sample at this temperature. It is mentioned earlier that generating gas product with high content of hydrogen and specially very little content of carbon monoxide, is the original goal of steam reforming of methanol reaction. Only if the generated H2 gas by methanol steam reforming reaction, meets the conditions stated above, it can be used as fuel for PEMFCs. As mentioned earlier, there are two main reaction pathways for carbon monoxide generation during steam reforming of methanol reaction: RWGS and direct dissociation of CH3OH. High temperatures remarkably lead to more CO production through RWGS due to this reaction is endothermic. Considering all above descriptions, based on the purpose of generating H2 gas with the least content of carbon monoxide, nanocatalyst which demonstrates great transformation of CH3OH specially at down temperatures or little selectivity toward CO production specially at high temperatures, is appropriate nanocatalyst for utilize in SRM reaction. According to literatures, the above-mentioned basic reaction pathways for carbon monoxide generation through SRM reaction, RWGS and direct dissociation of CH3OH, can progress on different active sites of copper. For example, RWGS reaction can be done on smaller copper sites and direct decomposition of methanol can be accomplished on bigger copper sites [48,49]. As can be seen in part (a) of Figs. 2 and 4, according to FESEM and AFM analysis, there are a lot of agglomerated particles in CZA-HT sample and such surficial morphology can cause to considerable carbon monoxide production via both RWGS and direct dissociation of CH3OH reactions. With considering this explanation, high value of carbon monoxide production is expected for CZA-HT sample even at low temperatures. As mentioned earlier, the comparison of FESEM images of CZA-HT and CZA-OG nanocatalysts demonstrates that applying oxalate gel coprecipitation synthesis method leads to lesser particles size and less aggregation of particles in CZA-OG sample. Moreover, comparative discussion about surficial texture properties of CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P samples shows that NTGDP treatment causes to premier surficial morphology and texture features in CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst so that this sample has the tiniest particles size, the lowermost aggregation of particles, and finally the narrowest size distribution among all three synthesized samples. Therefore, as mentioned above, lesser particles size and less aggregation of particles can cause to limited CO generation only via RWGS reaction and so, lower content of carbon monoxide formation is anticipated for CZA-OG sample in comparison with CZA-HT. Also, the lowest amount of CO production is expected for CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst compared with the other two samples. It is obvious from Fig. 9 that the obtained results of carbon monoxide selectivity for different fabricated samples have proper alignment with the outcomes from various characterization analysis techniques. As mentioned above, CZA-OG-P sample has the best physicochemical characterization among prepared nanocatalysts in order to use in SRM reaction. In this regard, it can be seen in Fig. 8 that the content of transformation of CH3OH for CZA-OG-P sample is approximately 100 % at 200 °C and the value of carbon monoxide production for this sample is only 0.6 % at the same temperature. Table 2 demonstrates comparative data of methanol conversion, carbon monoxide selectivity and temperature for some other catalysts available in literature. 3.3.3 Time on stream performance As previously explained, the nanocatalyst which is synthesized via gel oxalate precipitation procedure and modified via NTGDP, has the best physicochemical characterization among three prepared samples and this issue is approved by the results of different characterization analysis techniques. So, as mentioned in section of catalytic performance study toward hydrogen production from CH3OH/H2O mixture, the CZA-OG-P sample has the best efficiency in comparison with the other two synthesized samples in terms of the highest transformation of CH3OH and the lowermost selectivity toward CO production. Therefore, assessment of the performance of CZA-OG-P sample for long duration use in methanol steam reforming reaction is done and the outcomes of this evaluation experiment are displayed in Fig. 10 . As seen in this figure, the time on stream experiment is performed for 1400 min at 240 °C. It is obvious from Fig. 10 that the selectivity toward H2, CO2 and CO production and also the value of methanol conversion are almost fixed and without any tangible change within time on stream (TOS) efficiency test. So, considering the results of long duration use of CZA-OG-P sample in SRM reaction, it is determined that the performance of this sample is approximately stable in SRM reaction."
10,Deactivation study,"3.4 Deactivation study When the copper-based catalysts are used in SRM reaction, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes are less conducted compared with the case of applying metals catalysts of group 8–10 in this reaction. This issue causes to better selectivity toward preferable products through using copper-based nanocatalysts. But, extensive use of copper-based catalysts in SRM reaction is limited by some factors which lead to deactivation of them. There are three basic processes in order to deactivation of copper-based catalysts in previous studies: thermal sintering, carbon deposition and generation of formaldehyde, methyl formate and some other intermediates which are carbonaceous deposit. Among these deactivation processes thermal sintering occurs at the temperatures higher than 400 °C. But about carbon deposit, because breaking CO bonds to generate CC bonds and coke formation from hydrocarbons is not carried out on the copper-based catalysts unlike metals catalysts of group 8–10, Boudouard reaction is the only and the most important reaction route in order to coke formation at low temperatures through copper-based catalysts. In this section the deactivation study of the used CZA-OG-P sample in SRM reaction is studied through TG/DTG, SEM-EDX and AFM analysis of this nanocatalyst. 3.4.1 TG/DTG analysis Fig. 11 exhibits the graph of thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the used CZA-OG-P sample. The differential of the mentioned graph is also demonstrated in this figure. As seen in Fig. 11, by increasing temperature until 800 °C, the overall weight loss is about 5 %. As shown in the figure, there are two main zones in the TG graph of the used CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst. The weight loss at the temperature lower than 400 °C can be assigned to decomposition of physically and chemically adsorbed water molecules. The overall value of weight loss which is related to decomposition of water molecules is about 2.7 %. But about the weight loss at the temperature higher than 400 °C, it can be interpreted by decomposition of deposited coke and some other carbonaceous compounds. The overall amount of weight loss in the second zone which is related to decomposition of coke and carbonaceous compounds is about 2.3 %. As seen, in addition to TG graph of the used CZA-OG-P sample, the derivative of this graph (DTG), is also demonstrated in Fig. 11. The area under the derivative graph in each zone represents the value of decomposed compounds in that zone. It is obvious from figure that the amount of coke and carbonaceous compounds formation in used CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst during steam reforming of methanol reaction is very low and total weight loss which is proportional to decomposition of carbonaceous and specially coke compounds in TG graph, is only 2.3 %. As previously mentioned, coke and carbonaceous deposit formation on the nanocatalyst during a chemical process is one of the most important reasons in order to deactivation of it. So, the less formation of such compounds leads to more activity of the synthesized nanocatalyst and prevention of deactivation of it in chemical process. Therefore, considering all above descriptions, the results which are obtained from TG/DTG analysis of the used CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst have good and appropriate agreement with the outcomes from time on stream performance experiment. Regarding to the results of TG/DTG analysis, because of low coke formation on the CZA-OG-P sample during SRM reaction, good stability of this nanocatalyst in terms of constant selectivity toward H2, CO2 and CO generation as well as fixed value of methanol conversion in SRM reaction, is expected. 3.4.2 Morphology analysis SEM-EDX analysis of the used CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst in SRM reaction, which has been synthesized via gel oxalate precipitation procedure and modified with NTGDP is displayed in Fig. 12 . As it can be seen in the FESEM images of the used CZA-OG-P sample, morphology, surficial texture properties and particles size distribution of this sample are almost similar to primary CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst and the surficial morphology changes, are not noticeable. Also, about EDX micrographs of different elements for the used CZA-OG-P sample in steam reforming of methanol reaction, dispersion on the surface, the situation of different surficial elements as well as surficial chemical analysis of the used sample, are approximately similar to primary synthesized nanocatalyst. But, as a consequence of coke and carbonaceous compounds deposit, there are some carbon elements on the surface of used sample, which this issue is predictable from the results of TG/DTG analysis. As mentioned above, Boudouard reaction is the only and the most important reaction route in order to coke formation at low temperatures through copper-based catalysts. Hence, CO gas which has been generated through reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), can be converted to coke deposition via Boudouard reaction. The following two relations represent RWGS and Boudouard reactions, respectively. (8) C O 2 + H 2 → CO + H 2 O Carbon monoxide generation RWGS (9) CO + CO → C ( s ) + C O 2 Boudouard reaction Overview of 3D surface images of the used CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst in steam reforming of methanol reaction are illustrated in Fig. 13 . As seen in this figure, investigation about nanostructure of the used CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst in steam reforming of methanol reaction is carried out through study of overview of 3D surface analysis of this sample at 500 and 250 nm. On the other hand, overview of 3D surface analysis of this used catalyst at 2.5 and 1 μm, can be utilized in order to investigate about microstructure of the sample after long duration use in SRM reaction. It is obvious from the figure that the topography, roughness and some other special surficial texture properties such as pitches and protrusions of the used CZA-OG-P sample in SRM reaction are almost similar to primary synthesized nanocatalyst. In this regard, the amounts of average height and RMS parameters of the microstructure and nanostructure of the used CZA-OG-P sample in steam reforming of methanol reaction, are shown in Fig. 13. With the comparison of the amounts of these calculated parameters for primary synthesized nanocatalyst and the used sample, it is determined that there is no tangible difference between the amount of these parameters. Therefore, through this comparison, similar topography and roughness for the primary nanocatalyst and the used sample, is confirmed. Thus, the obtained results from morphology analysis of the used CZA-OG-P sample in SRM reaction, have proper agreement with the findings from TOS efficiency test. Regarding to the results of morphology analysis, because of no sensible changes in morphology, surficial texture properties, scattering of different surface elements, surficial chemical analysis, topography and roughness of the used CZA-OG-P sample during SRM reaction, it is anticipated that this nanocatalyst represents good stability in terms of constant selectivity toward H2, CO2 and CO generation as well as fixed value of methanol conversion in SRM reaction."
11,Conclusions,"The study of the characterization properties of the various fabricated samples was performed in different parts of nanocatalysts characterization section. As mentioned about XRD analysis, using of hybrid glow discharge plasma-oxalate-precipitation method led to the lowest relative crystallinity and crystallite size of different crystallite facets. Therefore, CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst had the highest and best scattering of various metallic oxides crystallite facets. Again, comparison of the surficial texture properties of CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P samples through FESEM and TEM analysis, showed that NTGDP treatment caused to superior surficial morphology and texture features in CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst, and thus, this sample had the tiniest particles size, lowermost aggregation of particles, the most monotonous dispensation of particles and finally the narrowest size distribution, among all three synthesized samples. Furthermore, the comparison of the dispersion on the surface as well as the properties of different surficial elements for CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P samples through EDX analysis, demonstrated that NTGDP treatment led to superior surficial elemental properties in CZA-OG-P sample, and so, this nanocatalyst had the most monotonous scattering of surficial elements and the least discrepancy between weight percentages of various elements in preliminary solution and final sample, among all three fabricated nanocatalysts. Finally, the comparison of the measured specific surface area for CZA-OG and CZA-OG-P nanocatalysts through BET analysis, indicated that NTGDP treatment led to higher specific surface area for CZA-OG-P nanocatalyst, and therefore, this sample had the greatest specific surface area, among all three prepared samples. Thus, considering all above descriptions about the outcomes of characterization techniques, it was determined that the nanocatalyst which was synthesized via gel oxalate precipitation procedure and modified via NTGDP, had the best properties in comparison with the other two samples. On the other hand, three prepared samples were used in SRM reaction, in order to assessment of the activity as well as the selectivity of them toward various products. In this way, it was determined that due to the best physicochemical characterization of CZA-OG-P sample, this nanocatalyst demonstrated the best efficiency in SRM reaction in terms of the highest transformation of CH3OH at down temperatures and the lowermost selectivity into CO production at high temperatures. Eventually, deactivation study was carried out for the used CZA-OG-P sample in SRM reaction and through this study it was determined that because of minimum changes in physicochemical characterization of the used sample, which was confirmed through TG/DTG, SEM-EDX and AFM analysis, the CZA-OG-P sample was stable in order to long-term use in methanol steam reforming reaction. So, this issue had good and appropriate consistency with the outcomes of TOS efficiency test for this sample."
