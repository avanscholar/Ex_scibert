0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) to benzaldehyde (BzH) over heterogeneous catalysts has attracted significant attention from the viewpoint of establishing green and sustainable chemical processes [1–16]. Several studies have been reported on the catalytic oxidation of BzOH to BzH with different catalysts and oxidants [1–3]. The main solid catalysts proposed for oxidation include metal, metal oxides and supported metals or metal oxides [4–10], heteropoly acids [11,12], carbon nanotubes materials [13,14], noble metals and their derivatives [15–17] and molecular sieves [18,19]. Among the various solid catalysts, manganese oxides are the most extensively studied metal oxides because of its strong oxygen storage/release ability, excellent redox properties and less expensive [20,21]. Moreover, the varieties of textural structure and oxidation state of Mn have important impacts on the catalytic performance. Such as a crystalline microporous manganese oxide, a cryptomelane octahedral molecular sieves (K-OMS-2) with a high surface area in the range of 20–135m2/g, was reported as a superior catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in liquid-phase in the presence of molecular oxygen as the oxidant [22]. It is observed that the polyvalent property of manganese seem to induce intricate effect on the activity. Kim and Shim [23] investigated the catalytic oxidation of toluene and benzene over commercial manganese oxides with various crystal phases, and found that the order of catalytic activity was Mn3O4 >Mn2O3 >MnO2. Garcia et al. [24] discovered that the Mn2O3 crystalline phase presents a higher intrinsic activity than MnO2 in the oxidation of naphthalene. Peluso et al. [25] studied the manganese dioxide catalyzed oxidation of ethanol, and suggested that a high concentration of Mn3+ could result in weak Mn–O bonds, which might ensure good catalytic activity. Su et al. [26] reported that the MnO2 catalyst showed a superior catalytic performance in the highly selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol as compared to other manganese oxide materials such as MnO, Mn2O3 and Mn3O4. Hu et al. discovered the amorphous MnO x has higher catalytic activity than OMS-2, Mn2O3 and γ-MnO2 in the aerobic oxidation of benzylic alcohols using molecular oxygen [9]. Above all, the morphologies of the manganese oxide has great effect on the performance of the activity. Even though manganese oxide is well known as an active metal oxide for oxidation reaction, the effects of different manganese precursors and preparation conditions on the textural structure and catalytic properties have not been explored enough. Potassium permanganate, nitrate and acetate precursors of manganese can generate different structures of manganese oxides and different manganese oxidation states. In addition, there is few work on evaluating the catalytic activity of MCM-41 supported manganese oxides for oxidation of BzOH with H2O2. This paper presents a comparison of three MCM-41 supported manganese oxides catalysts (MnO x /MCM-41) prepared from different manganese precursors (potassium permanganate, manganese nitrate and manganese acetate) and discusses the effect of calcination temperature on the manganese oxides catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All chemicals used were of AR grade. An aqueous solution of manganese nitrate (50wt%), potassium permanganate, sodium hydroxide, oxalic acid, hydrogen dioxide solution (30wt%) and BzOH were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company Limited. Siliceous MCM-41 (S BET =621m2/g) was purchased from catalyst factory of Nankai University."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts The MnO x /MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method using different manganese precursors (potassium permanganate, manganese(II) nitrate tetrahydrate and manganese (II) acetate). Nominal loading of catalysts was 10% based on mass of metallic manganese per mass of the catalyst (support plus manganese oxides). The preparation method of the samples prepared from KMnO4 and Mn(NO3)2 as follows. Typically, 1.0g of MCM-41 was added into KMnO4 or Mn(NO3)2 solution containing 0.1g of Mn under stirring, and then the slurry was stirred for 10h at 70°C followed drying at 100°C for 12h. The samples obtained were treated at different temperature in air for 3h. The Mn4+ can be readily reduced to Mn3+ and Mn2+ during the heat-treatments process in air, and resulting in the production of manganese oxides with mixed valence. The formed brown materials loaded on MCM-41 should be the mixed valence of manganese oxides such as MnO2, Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 [27–29]. These samples prepared from KMnO4 and Mn(NO3)2 solutions were denoted as Mn-1-x and Mn-2-x, respectively, where x represent the treatment temperature. The preparation method of the samples prepared from oxalic acid precursors of manganese as follows. Manganese hydroxide was prepared through dropwise addition of 1M NaOH solution at room temperature into a solution of manganese nitrate and the precipitate was formed. The resultant precipitate was filtered and washed. Acetic acid was added to the filter cake with an acetic acid/Mn ratio (molar) in all cases of 2.5 for consistency. Almost all solids were dissolved and the mixture stirred for 3h at 60°C. Then 1.0g of MCM-41 was added into the mixture under stirring and was stirred for 10h at 70°C followed drying at 100°C for 12h. The obtained samples were treated at different temperature in air for 3h and denoted as Mn-3-x, where x represent the treatment temperature."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the synthesised zeolite samples were recorded on an Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.54Å). The physisorption of N2 at 77K was carried out on a Quantachrome AUTOSORB-1-MP adsorption analyser. Prior to adsorption, the samples were outgassed at 300°C for 2h. The temperature-programmed reduction test was performed in hydrogen (H2-TPR) on Quantachrome ChemBET analyser in a quartz U-type tubular reactor. The hydrogen consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity detector. A 100mg of each sample was loaded into the reactor and purged with 40ml/min of argon for 2h at 200°C to eliminate contaminants, and then cooled down to 100°C. The temperature was increased to 650°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min with flowing of 10% H2/Ar and the results were recorded during the progress. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded in air on a SHIMADZU UV-2450 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Reference spectra were collected with pressed BaSO4 disks. The following parameters were used to collect data: 5.0 spectra band width, 0.5nm data pitch, 800–200nm measurement range, and 200nm/min scanning speed. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo Escalab 250 XPS system with Al Kα radiation as the exciting source. The binding energies were calibrated by referencing the C 1s peak (284.6eV) to reduce the sample charge effect. The deconvolution method of XPS spectra is fitted by Gaussian function."
5,Catalyst performance,"2.4 Catalyst performance Liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in magnetically stirred three necked round bottom flask (100mL) equipped with reflux condenser and a thermometer. The reaction temperature was maintained at 80°C by using oil bath. Typically, 0.3g of catalyst was stirred with a mixture of 0.1mmol BzOH and 0.16mmol H2O2 dissolved in 10mL toluene for 12h at atmospheric pressure. Then the catalyst was separated by filtration and the products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using an Agilent 6890 GC unit equipped with a HP-5 capillary column."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 XRD patterns of MnO x /MCM-41 catalysts The low-angle XRD patterns of MCM-41 and MnO x /MCM-41 treated by 300°C are shown in Fig. 1 . The intensive (100), (110), and (200) reflection peaks in the XRD pattern of MCM-41 associated with the hexagonal space group p6mm indicate a well-ordered mesostructure of the silica [30,31]. Compared with that of MCM-41, the intensity of diffraction peak of the MnO x /MCM-41 declined and the peak position has not shift obviously. This indicates the samples still maintain the well-ordered mesostructure when MnO x are introduced into the support. Fig. 2 shows the high-angle XRD patterns of the MnO x /MCM-41 prepared with varied manganese precursors and treatment temperatures. No obvious diffraction peaks are observed for all MnO x /MCM-41 catalysts but Mn-1-100. This indicates that no large crystals exist on the outer surface. This is probably due to the confined effect of the mesopore and the high surface area of MCM-41, leading to high dispersion of manganese oxide. Large manganese oxide crystals appear in the Mn-1-100 sample prepared from potassium permanganate according to the sharp diffraction peaks in the high angle XRD pattern. The sharp diffraction peaks almost disappear after treated at 200°C. According to the literature [32] and our XRD analysis, the Mn-1-100 sample might consist of a mixture that major include KMnO4 (PDF#07-0023), K3(MnO4)2 (PDF#21-0997) and K2MnO4 (PDF#12-0264). It is suggested that the components of Mn-1-100 sample was the salt of potassium permanganate rather than the manganese oxides. 3.1.2 N2 adsorption Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of MnO x /MCM-41 samples were measured to evaluate their surface and structural properties. Fig. 3 shows the nitrogen sorption isotherms of MCM-41 and MnO x /MCM-41 samples treated at 300°C. All samples exhibit isotherms of type IV with hysteresis loops, which are the characteristic of nanostructured materials with uniform mesopores. The adsorption and desorption isotherms show a large increase in the relative pressure (P/P 0) range from 0.2 to 0.4 for MCM-41 samples, due to the capillary condensation of nitrogen within the mesopores [33]. The sharpness of the inflection step reflects the uniform pore size distribution, and the P/P 0 position is clearly related to the diameter in the mesopore range. The second step in the isotherms at P/P 0 >0.9, which is observed for all samples, is attributed to the condensation of nitrogen in the depressions of rough surface or between small particles [34]. The surface area and pore parameters of different materials prepared with varied manganese precursors and treatment temperatures are listed in Table 1 . The surface areas are measured with BET method, and the pore volumes are calculated from desorption branch with BJH method, respectively. After addition the manganese oxide on supports, surface area and pore volume of catalysts decrease to some extent. The decrease of BET surface area is attributed to the incorporation of manganese oxide species. A certain amount of manganese oxide introduced into the pores occupied the space. In spite of the large amount of manganese species has been introduced, a relatively high BET surface area is still maintained, ranging from 621m2/g for MCM-41 to 554m2/g for Mn-2-400 sample. The decrease in pore volume is also found which agrees with the loss of surface area. 3.1.3 H2 TPR tests A change in the reductive properties is usually evaluated by the H2 temperature-programmed reduction, and the profiles can be differentiated both by the integral of the profiles and by the shift in the peak temperature. The former corresponds to the amount of H2 consumption, and the latter indicates the reducibility of the metal sites. The stages of the reduction have been interpreted as the phase evolution accompanied with valence evolution of manganese. The lowest temperature reduction process (<200°C) is usually corresponds to the consumption of structural oxygen close on the surface, without decomposition of the material (generation of oxygen vacancies) [35]. Then, successive manganese oxide reductions occur as follows: MnO2 →Mn2O3 →Mn3O4 →MnO [36,37]. Nevertheless, the attribution and analysis for the reduction peaks are different from previous literatures. For instance, two reduction stages of Mn x O were observed and the reduction stages were attributed to the conversion of MnO2/Mn2O3 to Mn3O4 and that of Mn3O4 to MnO, respectively [37–39]. In some reports, it has been shown that Mn3O4 also underwent a two-stage reduction instead of being reduced to MnO in one step [23,40,41]. In this work, the numbers and sites of the reduction peaks on the TPR profiles are obviously different for the MnO x /MCM-41 prepared from different precursors of manganese and treatment temperature (shown in Fig. 4 ). This suggests that the species and reducibility of the catalysts are direct correlation with precursors of manganese and treatment temperature. Total hydrogen consumptions together with those obtained for each transition are also shown in Table 1. The actual hydrogen consumption is calculated according to the areas of reduction peaks and CuO-based calibration. In the case of Mn-1 series catalysts, two mainly peaks in the range of 240–300°C (Low temperature peak, LTP) and in the range of 300–370°C (Middle temperature peak, MTP) are observed, which could be ascribed to the reduction processes of MnO2 →Mn2O3 and Mn2O3 →Mn3O4. In addition, a broad and low intense hydrogen consumption peak in the range of 400–450°C (High temperature peak, HTP) corresponding to Mn3O4 →MnO transitions can be observed. These results suggest that the potassium permanganate precursor forms mainly the mixture of MnO2 and Mn2O3, and small amount of Mn3O4. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4(a), the reduction peaks shift to higher temperature and the intense of HTP increases with increasing the treatment temperature. These changes suggest that the formation of MnO x is more difficult to be reduced under higher treatment temperature and the amount of Mn3O4 on the MCM-41surface increased. In the case of Mn-2 series catalysts, two peaks in the temperature range of 300–370°C and the other >370°C are observed, corresponding to Mn2O3 →Mn3O4 and Mn3O4 →MnO transitions, respectively [42,43]. The reduction peaks shift to higher temperature and the HTP broadens when elevate the treatment temperature. These data suggest that the nitrate precursor forms mainly mixture of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4, and the amount of Mn3O4 increases with increasing the treatment temperature. In the case of Mn-3 series catalysts, a strong and broad reduction peak in the temperature range of 300–370°C and a negligible peak at the temperature of >400°C are observed, which indicate that the acetate precursor produces mainly Mn2O3. In addition, there are slight shifts toward higher temperature for the reduction peaks and the amount of hydrogen consumption decreases with increasing the treatment temperature. 3.1.4 UV–Vis spectra Diffusion reflection spectroscopy of manganese catalysts is employed to study the state of the MnO x , and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . A wide absorption band which covers almost all the visible range of the spectrum is observable for MnO x /MCM-41. According to Table 2 , the band at ca. 255nm is associated with O2− →Mn2+ charge transfer transition [44,45], the absorption band near 350nm is assigned to O2− →Mn4+ [46], and the band between 400 and 550nm is assigned to O2− →Mn3+ [46]. Thus, MnO x /MCM-41 is made up of a mixture of mainly Mn3+ and Mn4+ oxo species and a small amount of Mn2+ oxo species. In the case of Mn-1 series catalysts, the absorption bands appear primarily in the range of 310–350nm, which indicates that the potassium permanganate precursor forms mainly the mixture of Mn4+ oxo species. The absorption band shift to high wavelength from 316°C to 333°C and then 341°C when elevate the treatment temperature from 100°C to 300°C. It indicates that the content of Mn3+ oxo species increases at the expense of Mn4+ oxo species. The absorption band for the Mn-2-200 sample appears at ∼340nm and declines slightly when treat temperature enhanced to 300°C and 400°C. However, the absorption band at 255nm increases slightly. Thus, it can be concluded that a certain amount of Mn2+ oxo species for Mn-2 sample produced by treated at 300°C and 400°C. A sharp band at 328nm for Mn-3-200 sample can be observed and assigned to the Mn4+ oxo species. This band shifts to high wavelength and the intensity significantly reduces with increasing the treated temperature. These changes suggest the Mn4+ oxo species translates to Mn3+ oxo species. Together with the H2-TPR data, it can be concluded that the potassium permanganate and acetate precursor of manganese can form the Mn4+ oxo species easily, whereas the nitrate precursors of manganese results in the Mn3+ and Mn2+ oxo species at low and high treated temperature, respectively. 3.1.5 XPS Characterization of chemical species located in the region near the catalyst surface can be carried out by XPS. The deconvolution of Mn 2p3/2 signal is known to be useful to distinguish the states of Mnδ+ and the results are recorded in Fig. 6 . The binding energies of Mn 2p3/2 in the intervals 639.9–640.3, 640.5–641.5, and 642.0–642.5eV can be ascribed to the presence of Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+ species, respectively [47,48]. The electron binding energy can be changed when presence of the supports or heteroatoms. Accordingly, the asymmetrical signal at ca. 641eV for the manganese oxide can be decomposed to three components in the intervals 639.9–640.3, 640.5–641.5, and 642.0–642.5eV. The detail information about the percentage contents of Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+ are recorded in Table 3 . In all cases the Mn 2p3/2 binding energies are slightly shifted to a higher binding energy for MnO x /MCM-41 with increasing treated temperature, implying the formation of Mnδ+ species with lower valence state. Take the Mn-1 series catalysts for example, the content of Mn3+ increases at the expense of Mn4+ with increasing the treated temperature, which indicates the partial MnO2 is transformed into Mn2O3 and Mn3O4. The peak at 647eV responsible for the Mn 2p3/2 of KMnO4 cannot be observed, which indicates that MnO4 − ions with higher oxidizability is reduced to the lower charge state manganese species loaded in the pores and on the outer surface [32]. Table 3 shows that the actual percentage of Mn4+ is 71.7% on the surface of Mn-1-100, and this value gradually decreases to 42.9% at treated temperature of 200°C and then arrives to the minimum (40.3%) at 300°C. The results suggest that low temperature easily obtain the high valence of Mnδ+, which could be reduced more easily. The results are in accordance with that from H2-TPR and UV–Vis. For Mn-3 catalysts, in spite of the fact that only one reduction peaks, Mn2O3, is detected by H2-TPR, the position of the XPS peaks seems to be located between the binding energies typical of Mn2O3 and MnO2. These observations most likely indicate a lower oxidation state of manganese on the surface than the Mn-2 catalysts. Fig. 7 shows the O 1s spectra of the studied materials. According to the peak positions, three types of oxygen species can be identified: the low binding energy peak, OI with binding energy from 529.2 to 529.8eV, is ascribed to lattice oxygen (O2−); the medium binding energy peak, OII with binding energy of 530.1–531.5eV, is assigned to surface adsorbed oxygen (O2− or O−), –OH groups and oxygen vacancies; and finally the high binding energy peak (ca. 533.0eV), OIII, is likely associated with adsorbed molecular water [49–51]. The peak positions and relative abundance of OI and OII species are listed in Table 3. As can be observed, the amounts of oxygen vacancies are identical and the amounts of lattice oxygen are different for all materials because their crystalline structures are different. The amounts of lattice oxygen for all samples increase gradually with increasing the treated temperature. The changes indicate that a certain amount of amorphous manganese oxide species are in the systems and transforms to crystalline phase when increases the treated temperature. The characteristics foretell the diversities of the catalytic activity are related to the lattice oxygen."
8,Activity of the catalysts,"3.2 Activity of the catalysts The reactivity of the MnO x /MCM-41 catalysts systems in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 is compared in Fig. 8 . The selectivity to BzH of all the catalysts are >99%, with a negligible amount of benzoic acid as byproduct, showing that the oxidation of BzOH to BzH has highly selective under the conditions in present work. The changes of conversion of BzOH versus reaction time for three series catalysts show same trend. At the beginning of reaction, the conversion of BzOH increases with increasing reaction time in ca 9h. The conversions increase slowly and even do not increase with a further increasing reaction time to 12h. Both the Mn-1 and Mn-3 systems exhibits an outstanding catalytic performance leading to a high conversion of alcohol to BzH (Con. >80% and Con. >90%) in ca 12h, while the Mn-2 catalyst prepared from nitrate precursors shows low active. Disclosing a direct relationship between activity and the species of active phase, these results indicate that the species of MnO x plays a vital role in oxidation of BzOH. In this study, both manganese precursors and treated temperature in air have important influences on forming the dispersed MnO x species for supported Mn catalysts. For the Mn-1 series catalysts, the sample treated at 100°C without calcination exhibits the highest BzOH conversion. There is a gradual loss of the catalytic activity when the calcination temperature increases to 200°C. No noticeable change in the catalytic activity is observed when further increases the calcination temperature. These results suggest that low-temperature calcination gives rise to the formation of highly active Mn oxide species for BzOH oxidation. At high temperatures, the decomposition of this particular active phase may occur. This result is in agreement with earlier reports by Tang [52]. Moreover, Schurz et al. [22] compared the catalytic performance of the octahedral molecular sieves of the type K-OMS-2 materials, crystalline manganese oxides, and amorphous MnO2 in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The K-OMS-2 materials showed high active than crystalline manganese oxides (MnO, Mn2O3, Mn3O4, and β-MnO2), but less active than amorphous MnO2. It indicates that the high catalytic activity is related to both the species of MnO x and the amount of amorphous MnO2. The Mn-2 series displays the lowest activity. The Mn-2-200 catalyst calcined at 200°C, exhibits a 55% conversion and drops to 38.5% and <10% when increasing the treated temperature to 300°C and 400°C. The Mn-3 series displays the best catalytic activity. The Mn-3-300 catalyst calcined at 300°C, exhibits a 94% conversion and >99% selectivity, whereas catalysts calcined at 200°C and 400°C shows a conversion of 81.8% and 47.6%. These catalytic performance results are correlated to the species of MnO x obtained from the H2-TPR, UV–Vis, and XPS analysis of the samples. The Mnδ+ with the higher valence state provides the higher catalytic activity because of its stronger reducibility. While the catalyst calcined at high temperature has a lower valence state of Mnδ+ and yields a lower conversion product. Hence it can be understood that the calcination temperature of the catalyst has profound influence on the catalytic performance. In order to further evaluate the performance of the catalyst, Mn-1-300 and Mn-3-300 were used repeatedly for 2 cycles under the same conditions to test their catalytic reusability as shown in Fig. 9 . The used catalyst were filtered and regenerated by washing it with toluene and drying at 100°C for 12h before using it in the subsequent runs. Clearly, both catalysts suffer from a severe deactivation. The adsorption of loosely bonded water, benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde on the surface of the catalysts is the obviously reason for deactivation. The treatment temperature here was too low for a complete regeneration of the initial catalyst activity. This is consistent with Son et al. [53], who mention a treatment at 80°C in air does not restore any catalytic activity and treatment at 300°C to completely restore the catalytic activity."
9,Conclusion,"Potassium permanganate, nitrate and acetate precursors of manganese generate different species of MnO x on the surface of MCM-41 supports. The potassium permanganate forms mainly MnO2 or Mn2O3 at low or high treated temperature, respectively. The nitrate precursor forms mainly mixture of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4, while the acetate precursor produces Mn2O3. The high valence of Mnδ+ oxo with super reducibility can be obtained at low treated temperature, which represents the high catalytic activity. The Mn-3-300 catalyst prepared by acetate precursors and treated at 300°C shows a high activity of 94% and selectivity of >99%. Considering all the characterization and reaction data reported in this study, it is concluded that manganese precursors and treated temperature affects the species of MnO x , thus plays the important role on the catalytic activity."
