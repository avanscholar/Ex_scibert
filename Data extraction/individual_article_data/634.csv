0,Introduction,"Nitrogen-containing compounds such as amines and amides constitute an important group of compounds that are of key importance in industrial chemical synthesis [1]. Among these nitrogen-containing compounds, secondary amines are of particular value. There are various methods to prepare them, including electrophilic alkylation [2], reductive alkylation [2] and amination of aryl halides [3,4]. The reaction of primary amines with alkyl halides in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of inorganic bases [5] is indeed the preferred laboratory method. Even though these protocols have often reached excellent yield levels, there are drawbacks associated with them, that is, low atom efficiency, high waste/by-products production and low selectivity toward the desired secondary amines because of the competing formation of undesired tertiary amines and alkylammonium halides. One approach could be the hydroamination of olefins and alkynes [6]. However, this method is severely limited by the availability of the corresponding olefin and the electrophilic character of the nitrogen reagent. Another promising protocol is the alkylation of amines by alcohols using a reaction sequence that has been variously termed “hydrogen autotransfer,” “borrowing hydrogen mechanism” or “self-supply system for active hydrogen” [7–12]. In this reaction, the alcohol is formally dehydrogenated on the catalyst and forms a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde from a primary alcohol), whereas the hydrogen is bound to the catalyst as a hydride species (Scheme 1 ). The carbonyl compound reacts with the amine under elimination of one molecule of water to form the imine. Hydrogenation of the imine with the abstracted hydrogen from the first step yields the desired amine. In summary, the catalyst “borrows” a molecule of hydrogen and “auto transfers” it to the intermediate imine to form the final product. There are several advantages to this N-alkylation method, such as the ready availability of the required alcohols and the high atom efficiency of the transformation where both products from the alcohol dehydrogenation (hydrogen and carbonyl compound) are used in the reaction and water is formed as the only by-product [13]. In addition, this process is highly selective to the desired amine as competing self-condensation of the carbonyl substrate is minimized due to its low concentration. Upon dehydrogenation of the alcohol, the carbonyl substrate reacts to form an imine. This N-alkylation reaction proceeds smoothly in the absence of an additional hydrogen source. In contrast, reductive amination requires high concentration of the carbonyl substrate and high pressure of hydrogen for good yields. Many homogeneous transition metal catalysts [14–17], especially based on ruthenium [18–22] and iridium [23–28], have been reported for this transformation. Watanabe et al. [18] used RuCl2(PPh3)3 as the catalyst in the alkylation of aniline derivatives by primary alcohols and obtained the corresponding N,N-dialkylated amines as the main product. Other examples include [Ru3(CO)12] and N-phenyl-2-(dicyclohexylphosphanyl)pyrrole [21], [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 with DPEPhos 60 as ligand [22] and [IrCp*Cl2]2 together with a base [23]. The high cost of the stabilizing ligands coupled with difficulties in the recovery and reuse is the drawback of these homogeneous systems. Hence, the application of efficient, easily recoverable and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts would be clearly advantageous. One of the earliest examples of a heterogeneous catalyst for N-alkylation is silica gel [29]. Since then, γ-alumina [30], solid acids [31,32] and transition metal-based catalysts such as Pd [33,34], Pt [35,36], Ru [37,38] and Ir [39] have been reported. Concerns about the cost and availability of Pt-group metals have spurred the search for alternative metal catalysts. He et al. [40] used Cu(OH) x /Al2O3 and Cu(OH) x /TiO2 for the N-alkylation of amines with activated benzylic alcohols. Although no cocatalyst was required, treatment of the precursor catalyst with NaOH was necessary for activity. Magnetite Fe3O4 also catalyzed N-alkylation, but only between activated substrates, for example, aromatic amines and benzylic alcohols [41]. Supported iron oxide nanoparticles are active when used with a base, for example, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) or potassium or sodium tert-butoxide under microwave irradiation where the temperatures are in the range of 150–170°C [42]. In general, the activity of these base metal catalysts is lower than that of precious metals. Silver is a feasible choice as it is less expensive than metals like Au, Pt, Rh, Ir or Ru. However, due to its lower activity for C–H bond activation, it is currently not as widely used in catalysis as the platinum-group metals. Shimizu et al. [43] showed that alumina-supported silver in combination with FeCl3 as a Lewis acidic cocatalyst formed an active system for the N-benzylation of anilines with alcohols at 140°C. The high catalytic activity with turnover number (TON) of 23 was attributed to a cooperation between coordinatively unsaturated sites on the very small silver particles (diameter below 2nm), acid/base sites on the alumina support and the Lewis acidic Fe(III) cation. The same Ag/Al2O3 catalyst was also active in the one-step synthesis of N-substituted anilines from nitroaromatics and benzyl alcohols under 0.2MPa hydrogen pressure [44]. However, more base (20mol.% KF) and a reaction temperature of 155°C were needed. Recently, Shimizu et al. [45] investigated alumina-supported copper–silver bimetallic catalysts for the N-alkylation reaction. They found that at 5 atom% Ag, this catalyst was highly efficient in the alkylation of anilines and aliphatic amines with benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The bimetallic structure was proposed to be crucial in the promotion of alcohol dehydrogenation as well as hydride transfer to the imines. The reaction was carried out without any cocatalyst although a high reaction temperature of 155°C was required. Cui et al. [46] combined the dehydrogenation ability of silver with the nucleophilic addition property of molybdenum. The hybrid oxide, Ag6Mo10O33, together with K2CO3 or potassium tert-butoxide gave product yields of 80–90% in the alkylation of amines, carboxamides, sulfonamides and ketones with aliphatic alcohols. The previous studies on supported silver catalysts [43–45] show that a close interaction between the support and the metal catalyst is important for the dehydrogenation step in the N-alkylation with alcohols. To facilitate this interaction, we prepared the catalysts following the procedure of Park’s group [47,48] where nanoparticles of the active metal are entrapped in an in situ – generated sol–gel alumina support. These authors have shown that such catalysts have excellent activities for a variety of reactions [47–50]. Due to the intimate mixing, the heterogeneous system is expected to offer a wide substrate tolerance and high catalytic activity."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of Al2O3-entrapped Ag catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of Al2O3-entrapped Ag catalysts Alumina-entrapped Ag catalysts were prepared with Ag loadings from 0.29 to 13wt.%. In a typical synthesis for a 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3 sample, AgNO3 (63mg/0.37mmol) and aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (8.32ml/32.4mmol) were dissolved in 2-butanol (1.98ml). The resulting gel was stirred at 100°C for 3h to give a yellow suspension, following by the dropwise addition of deionized water (4.5ml). After stirring for another hour at 100°C, the suspension was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The solid catalyst was washed with acetone, dried at 100°C and calcined for 1h at 600°C (10°Cmin−1 ramp). Prior to use, the catalyst was activated in flowing H2 at 300°C for 30min. The same procedure was used to prepare a 2.4wt.% Cu/Al2O3 catalyst except that copper acetate was used as precursor for the metal. For comparative purpose, a 2.4wt.% Ag sample was also synthesized by impregnating 0.976g of commercial γ-Al2O3 (Merck, 150m2 g−1) with a 15ml solution of silver nitrate (37mg). The suspension was stirred for 4h at room temperature before increasing the temperature to 90°C to evaporate the water. After drying overnight at 100°C, the sample, 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3–I, was calcined and activated as for the alumina-entrapped Ag samples. The metal content was determined by ICP-AES."
3,Procedure for N-alkylation,"2.2 Procedure for N-alkylation Typically, the catalytic N-alkylation of benzyl alcohol and aniline was carried out using 1.5mmol aniline and 3mmol benzyl alcohol in 5ml p-xylene. The reaction mixture was placed in a 25-ml round bottom flask equipped with a condenser. After heating to 120°C under N2, 0.165g catalyst and 0.1g base promoter were added. Aliquots were removed at regular time intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography. The products were identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). For lower boiling substrates, the reaction was carried out under He in a 50-ml Teflon-lined autoclave (Parr) equipped with magnetic stirring and sampling port. The reaction mixture consisted of 3mmol alcohol, 1.5mmol amine and 5ml p-xylene as solvent together with 0.165g catalyst and 0.1g Cs2CO3."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The textural properties of the catalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption (Micromeritics Tristar 2000). Prior to the measurements, the each sample was degassed under N2 at 300°C for 4h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured with a Siemens D5005 diffractometer equipped with variable slits and a copper anode (CuK α λ 1.54056Å). The diffractograms were recorded over a 2θ range from 30° to 95°. The samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 3010) operated at 200kV. The finely ground sample was suspended in 2-propanol, and a drop was placed onto a carbon-coated copper grid and dried before TEM measurements."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Textural properties,"3.1 Textural properties The textural properties of the catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The Ag/Al2O3 samples prepared by in situ generation of the support have high surface areas in excess of 250m2 g−1 even after calcination at 600°C. For example, the 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3 sample has a surface area of 281m2 g−1, which is almost twice that of the catalyst prepared by wet impregnation onto γ-Al2O3. The N2-sorption isotherms of Ag/Al2O3 samples exhibit type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop at P/P°∼0.6–0.9, indicative of the presence of mesopores (Fig. 1 ). As the Ag loading increased from 0.29 to 13wt.%, the mean pore diameter decreased from 14.5 to 5.4nm. The highly porous nature of the samples is reflected in the large pore volumes, which decreased from 2.2 to 0.54cm3 g−1 with higher Ag content. This can be attributed to partial blockage of the pores by the metal aggregates at higher metal loading. For samples with 0.29–2.4wt.% Ag, the powder X-ray diffractograms showed only the broad peaks of γ-Al2O3 support (Fig. 2 ). The absence of reflexes due to Ag suggests that the metal is well dispersed on the support and/or that the crystalline size of Ag nanoparticles is below the detection limit of X-ray diffractometry, typically less than 4nm. Indeed, transmission electron micrographs of 0.59 and 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3 showed that the Ag nanoparticles were smaller than ∼3nm (Figs. S1 and S2). Only at higher Ag loading, 6.2 and 13wt.%, did the reflexes of crystalline Ag appear in the X-ray diffractogram. This agrees well with a mean Ag particle size of 4.5nm observed in the transmission electron micrograph of 6.2wt.% Ag/Al2O3 (Fig. S3). In comparison with the alumina-entrapped Ag catalysts, the sample prepared by wet impregnation (Fig. S4) had bigger Ag particles. Here, the (111) reflex of metallic Ag could be clearly detected in the X-ray diffractogram even at 2.4wt.% Ag (Fig. S5). Using the Scherrer equation, the Ag crystallite size for 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3–I was estimated to be 5.4nm, which is larger than the mean Ag particle size of 1.7nm found in the alumina-entrapped 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3 sample."
7,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity 3.2.1 N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol The activity of the catalysts was tested for the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol (Scheme 2 ). Benzyl alcohol and aniline did not form any products in the absence of a catalyst (Table 2 , entry 1). Similarly, γ-Al2O3 synthesized from aluminum tri-sec-butoxide and that obtained commercially showed no activity (Table 2, entries 2 and 3). However, 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3 prepared from aluminum tri-sec-butoxide and hydrogen-activated before use gave 29% conversion after 19h (Table 2, entry 4). The intermediate imine, N-benzylideneaniline 1, and the secondary amine, N-benzylaniline 2, were formed in almost equal amounts (51:49). The addition of a base promoter, Cs2CO3, led to a tremendous increase in the activity, so that>99% conversion was obtained (Table 2, entry 5). Equally striking is the very high selectivity, >99%, to N-benzylaniline 2. Besides water, the only other product formed was the imine 1. No tertiary amine 3 was observed. Activation of the catalyst by pretreatment in a hydrogen flow is essential; without this activation step, the conversion was only 61% and the selectivity to N-benzylaniline 2 was reduced to 46% with N-benzylideneaniline 1 being the predominant product (Table 2, entry 6). The hydrogen pretreatment results in the formation of active metallic silver particles and the removal of any adsorbed oxygen. In order to verify whether the hydrogen incorporated into N-benzylaniline 2 comes from hydrogen adsorbed at the metal surface during the pretreatment or from the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol, the reduced catalyst was flushed with N2 at 300°C for 3h. The activity and selectivity of the reaction was unaffected by this treatment (Table 2, entry 7), indicating that the hydrogen incorporated into N-benzylaniline 2 comes indeed from the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. Comparing the activity of Al2O3-entrapped Ag catalyst with that prepared by wet impregnation, it was found that the conversion after 19h over the impregnated catalyst, 2.4% Ag/Al2O3-I, was only 45% (Table 2, entry 8), while 2.4% Ag/Al2O3 had>99% conversion. Furthermore, over 2.4% Ag/Al2O3-I, the major product was N-benzylideneaniline 1 (96% selectivity) and not N-benzylaniline 2. The predominant formation of the imine may be due to a poorer hydrogenation capability of the sample, possibly due to the lower reactivity of the atoms at the surface of bigger Ag clusters (mean size 5.4nm) as compared to that for 2.4% Ag/Al2O3 (mean size 1.7nm). Shimizu et al. [43] also reported a drop in turnover frequency and amine selectivity for Ag clusters above 2nm. As the addition of Cs2CO3 increased the activity significantly, other basic promoters were investigated (Table 2, entries 9–11). The results show that K3PO4 is also an effective promoter with 96% conversion of aniline and>99% selectivity to benzylaniline 2. The promotional effect of a base in the dehydrogenation of alcohols to form ketones and aldehydes has been observed in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems [16,51,52]. It is proposed that the base helps in the deprotonation of the primary alcohol to form an alkoxide and also facilitates the removal of a hydride from it. The catalytic activity of 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3 in the presence of the promoter is higher than that of 5% Ru/Al2O3 and 5% Pd/Al2O3. After 19h, full conversion was obtained for 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3, but the conversion was only 26% and 75% for 5% Pd/Al2O3 and 5% Ru/Al2O3, respectively. Comparing the activity on a molar basis, the intrinsic activity decreased from 41, 13 and 5mol aniline converted/mol metal for the alumina-supported Ag, Ru and Pd catalysts, respectively. For the Ru and Pd catalysts, the main product was the secondary imine 1, showing that these catalysts were not as efficient in hydrogenating the intermediate imine to N-benzylaniline as Ag. Surprisingly, the Al2O3-entrapped copper catalyst (Figs. S6 and S7) was more active (18mol/molCu) than the supported Ru or Pd catalysts. However, at 2.4wt.% loading, the selectivity toward the benzylaniline 2 was only 36% as compared to>99% for the silver-based catalyst. To optimize the N-alkylation of aniline by benzyl alcohol, the effect of silver loading on the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst was studied. The initial reaction rate (determined from conversion after 1h) increased steeply up to 2.4wt.% Ag before decreasing slightly (Fig. 3 ). The turnover frequency (TOF), calculated from the initial rate and based on the total Ag content, decreased by more than an order of magnitude, from 13 to 1.2h−1, as the Ag loading increased from 0.29 to 13wt.%. Similarly, the TOF based on the number of surface Ag atoms also decreased, from 15 to 7.5h−1 for the 0.59–13wt.% Ag/Al2O3 (Fig. S8). The number of surface Ag atoms was estimated based on the mean diameter of the silver crystallites obtained from TEM and XRD measurements [53,54]. The TEM micrographs show that as the Ag loading increased from 0.59 to 6.2wt.%, the mean crystallite size increased from 1.0 to 4.5nm. Smaller crystallites offer a higher density of coordinatively unsaturated sites. Such edge and corner atoms are often the active sites for reaction due to their higher reactivity. Furthermore, in the bigger crystallites, the number of Ag atoms adjacent to the support is reduced. The interaction of Ag with the acid–base sites of alumina, and the promoter plays a significant role in the catalytic cycle [43]. This explains the decrease in TOF with the increasing particle size, even in the case that the TOF is normalized to surface atoms only. The activity of our catalysts with 0.59–6.2wt.% Ag corresponds to turnover numbers (TONs) of 16–75. This compares well with the reported turnover numbers of 18 and 23 for 5mol.% Ru(OH) x /Al2O3 [37] and 5wt.% Ag/Al2O3 [43], respectively. Furthermore, the reaction temperatures for these catalysts were higher (132 and 140°C) than the 120°C used in this study. 3.2.2 Other substrates The N-alkylation of other substrates was investigated using the heterogeneous 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3 catalyst in an autoclave at autogenous pressure (plus 1atm He). The rate of N-alkylation of aniline increased with the chain length of linear alkyl alcohols (Table 3 , entries 4–7). In all cases, the main product was the secondary amine. With methanol, the reaction was sluggish, and less than 1% N-methylaniline was formed. With 1-butanol and 1-pentanol, 5% conversion and 25% conversion were observed, respectively, after 19h. 1-Hexanol (Table 3, entry 7) reacted with aniline to give a satisfactory yield of 69% N-hexylaniline. However, no reaction occurred when long-chained 1-octadecanol was used as the alkylating agent (Table 3, entry 8). Possibly, the long C18 chain poses a steric hindrance in the transformation steps to the amine, in addition to diffusion limitations due to its bulkier size. Indeed, the reaction between cyclohexylmethanol and aniline gave only 15% conversion after 19h. The predominant product was the imine, N-(cyclohexylmethylene)aniline (Table 3, entry 9) formed with the elimination of an equivalent of H2. Alkylation of secondary amines, 1-phenylethanamine and cyclohexylamine, with benzyl alcohol also yielded imines as the major product (Table 3, entries 10 and 11). These results suggest that hydrogenation of the imines could be rate-determining due to steric hindrance. Interestingly, the secondary amines, piperidine and pyrrolidine (Table 3, entries 12 and 13) formed tertiary amines as well as amides. The latter was the major product with 76–78% selectivity. The hemiaminal formed from the secondary amine and the carbonyl species preferentially undergoes dehydrogenation rather than dehydration. 3.2.3 Heterogeneity of reaction and reuse of catalyst In order to test for leaching and to confirm that the reaction is indeed heterogeneously catalyzed, the reaction was allowed to run initially in the presence of 2.4% Ag/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 4 ). After 2h, the catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture by centrifugation. The clear supernatant was again brought to reaction conditions. Over a period of next 16h, the conversion remained unchanged and no further reaction was observed. These experiments confirm that the active phase did not leach from the catalyst under the reaction conditions. The activity of 2.4% Ag/Al2O3 was tested for reuse. Following the batch reaction, the catalyst was recovered by filtration, washed with large amounts of 2-propanol, followed by acetone and reactivated in H2 at 300°C. The rate of reaction was very similar to the fresh catalyst, and N-benzylaniline was formed with 95–97% selectivity at>99% conversion (Table 3, entry 1). 3.2.4 Mechanistic studies In the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol catalyzed by 2.4wt.% Ag/Al2O3, only two products, N-benzylideneaniline 1 and N-benzylaniline 2, were detected. The reaction profile shows the consecutive transformation of aniline first to 1 and then to 2 (Fig. 5 ). The concentration of 1 increased to a maximum at 4h before decreasing with time as it transformed to 2. From the activity results with and without a base (Table 2), we postulate that a crucial step is the formation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol. We have previously reported that K3PO4 is a highly efficient solid base catalyst in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes using alcohols without needing a metal catalyst [55]. The low reaction rate when the catalyst is present without the base (Table 2, entry 4) as compared to the rate enhancement when present together (Table 2, entries 5 and 11) shows the synergistic effect of Ag/Al2O3 and Cs2CO3 (or K3PO4). However, without any hydrogen acceptor, for example, oxygen or imine, the presence of the catalyst and base promoter is not enough to catalyze the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. A low yield of<2% was recorded (Table 4 , entry 1). The addition of a hydrogen acceptor such as N-benzylideneaniline 1 is necessary for dehydrogenation to occur, and benzaldehyde was formed in 15% yield (Table 4, entry 2). The coupling of benzaldehyde with aniline yielded 100% N-benzylideneaniline 1 within 1h without needing any catalyst (Table 4, entry 3). Using gaseous hydrogen, N-benzylideneaniline 1 was readily reduced to N-benzylaniline 2 with a yield of 80% (Table 4, entry 4). In comparison, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1 with benzyl alcohol proceeded efficiently over the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst to give 61% yield of 2 (Table 4, entry 2). An inert atmosphere is essential to ensure that the reaction can proceed to the desired product 2 because under aerobic conditions, aniline and benzyl alcohol react to give exclusively 1 (Table 4, entry 5). Based on these observations, we propose that the reaction proceeds with the transitory formation of the Ag hydride species (Scheme 3 ). The role of the base is connected with the dehydrogenation step to form the carbonyl compound since the reaction of the imine to amine proceeds smoothly without base. Possibly, the base aids in deprotonation of the alcohol to form an alkoxide at a Lewis acid site of the alumina support. The removal of a hydride from the alkoxide by the Ag catalyst leads to the formation of the carbonyl compound. The carbonyl compound readily reacts with a primary amine to form the corresponding imine. Finally, the hydride and a proton from the alumina are transferred back to the imine to afford the corresponding secondary amine. Starting with a secondary amine, both the amine and amide can form. Due to stabilization by the electron donating alkyl substituents of the secondary amine, the hemiaminal intermediate has a longer life time than that formed from a primary amine. Hence, it can undergo further hydride elimination forming the amide. Imine-like intermediates are readily hydrogenated to the amine."
8,Conclusion,"Silver-based catalysts were generated by in situ precipitation of silver particles in an aluminum oxyhydroxide support followed by calcination at 600°C. The resulting Ag/Al2O3 samples were active for the N-alkylation of amines with alcohols with 2.4wt.% Ag being optimal. The higher activity compared to samples prepared by wet impregnation shows that an intimate mixing of silver and the support is important. The addition of Cs2CO3 or K3PO4 as a base promoter improved the activity and selectivity to amines. N-Benzylaniline was formed in>99% yield from aniline and benzyl alcohol. The base promoter is necessary for the efficient dehydrogenation of the alcohol to the corresponding carbonyl compound that then reacts spontaneously with the primary or secondary amine to form the imine. Hydrogenation of the imine to the desired amine takes place under an inert atmosphere using the self-generated hydrogen from the alcohol dehydrogenation step. In addition to the tertiary amines, amides were formed when piperidine and pyrrolidine were reacted with benzyl alcohols. The heterogeneous Ag/Al2O3 can be recycled and reused without loss of activity and selectivity."
