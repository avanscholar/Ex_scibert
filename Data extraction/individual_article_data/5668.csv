0,Introduction,"Hierarchical superstructures (HSs) are made up of nanoscale building blocks (nanocrystals, nanoparticles) that self-assemble to extend in more than one dimension, which results from the successful manipulation of materials from nano to meso and all the way up to the macroscale. They are characterized by the arrangement of the building blocks in a consistent fashion as to give a unique architectural and reproducible design. HSs exhibit unique and collective physical and chemical properties different from those of the monomorphological structures, for example highly effective transfer of both mass and charge, thanks to the long ways present in their interconnected nanostructure [1,2]. One of the most important advantages of hierarchical superstructures is their high surface area, which is important in electrocatalysis and other applications [3]. A range of hierarchical superstructures made of various materials, including metals, semiconductors, heterogeneous composites, hydroxides and organic materials have been successfully prepared [1,4–6]. However, new methods for the synthesis of metal nanostructures of different architectures are necessary. These methods are aimed at providing reproducibility and control over properties such as composition, size, shape and morphology, surface species, stability, and isolability, which are determinant for advanced applications of nanostructures [7]. Platinum, a precious transition metal with electronic configuration [Xe]4f 145d 96s 1, is considered to exhibit effective catalytic activity in alcohol oxidation reaction [8,9], fuel cells [10,11], petroleum cracking [12], and electron transfer reactions [5]. Platinum metals or bimetallic alloys with nanoarchitectural morphologies exhibit exceptional and unique properties, such as affinity for hydrogen, oxygen and various other molecules [13]. This extends their applications to heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis [14], and in particular fuel cells [15,16]. Electrochemical processes such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been widely reported and the use of Pt or Pt alloy nanomaterials as electrocatalysts for electron transfer and rapid kinetics has been well investigated [17]. The use of Pt and Pt-alloyed nanomaterials facilitate fast reaction rate in acidic media, possessing low Tafel slope, minimum onset overpotential and optimal hydrogen binding energy which helps to overcome the high energy barrier and kinetically sluggish reaction which is typical of HER [17,18]. Fabrication of Pt and Pt-based nanostructures are conducted to improve catalytic performance and reduce the usage of Pt. Nanoporous platinum structures [3,19], two- and three-dimensional platinum nanodendrites [20], Pt–Ru mesostructures [21], hierarchical porous platinum nanoflowers and assembly of platinum nanochains [8], have been reported as highly active. Thus, emphasis on the development of soft, facile, self-assembly routes for the formation of Pt HSs is paramount. Among reported methods are thermal vapor transport and condensation technique [22], liquid-liquid transfer method [23], chemical corrosion and electroless deposition [3], solvothermal method [24], and galvanic replacement reaction [25]. However, these methods present high-energy requirements, non-facile synthetic paths, and are inadequate for scale up. The fabrication of metal nanostructures using one of these methods over a large area with high uniformity remains a major issue. The use of microemulsion (ME) systems is an efficient alternative in the synthesis of nanostructures. ME have been applied as confined reaction media, and soft template, for the chemical synthesis of small nanoparticles, nanowires and nanorods [26–31]. ME are thermodynamically stable colloidal dispersions in which two immiscible liquids (typically water and oil) coexist due to the presence of a monolayer of surfactant molecules with balanced hydrophilic–lipophilic properties [32]. These colloidal systems are optically isotropic, with a very small characteristic size (2–50 nm). ME can exist as oil-swollen direct micelles dispersed in water (o/w ME), water-swollen inverse micelles dispersed in oil (w/o ME) or with both aqueous and oily continuous domains as interconnected sponge-like channels (BCME), depending on the oil/water ratio and the hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) of the surfactant. The surfactant-stabilized nanocavities provide a cage-like effect that limits particle nucleation, growth and agglomeration [33]. The controlled synthesis of Pt nanoparticles [34] and flower-like hierarchical nanostructures of crystalline ZnO and ZnO2 nanoparticles [35], were reported in o/w ME media; whereas the synthesis of iron oxide NPs [36], zinc oxide NPs [22], silver NPs [37,38], Pt, Au and Fe NPs [39] were reported using BCME. In such investigations, the synthesis in BCME mainly led to spherical nanoparticles as random agglomerates. However, the preparation of inorganic 3D hierarchical superstructures using BCME as confined reaction media has not been explored so far. The closest situation is when a monolithic, polymerized BCME is infiltrated with inorganic precursors such as tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) into its porous network, followed by calcination [40]. However, such approach has only been applied to the preparation of certain materials such as bicontinuous SiO2 and normally the characteristic dimensions of polymeric BCME are larger than those of conventional BCME. The channels of BCME have a thickness in the order of tens of nanometers. Both water and oil channels are continuous phases, having infinite lengths. Thus, it is feasible to imagine the growth of hierarchical superstructures inside them, as the narrow thickness of the channels will allow the formation of nanometric building blocks, whilst their interconnection will allow the self-assembly of these nanoparticles into 3D networks. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report on the synthesis of platinum hierarchical superstructures (PtHSs), and in general metallic HSs, in bicontinuous microemulsion media using lipophilic and hydrophilic platinum salts as the starting material. The crystalline structure, morphology, size of the novel PtHSs and the electrocatalytic activity towards HER were fully evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals (1,5-cyclooctadiene)dimethylplatinum(Ⅱ) 97% (C10H16Pt, Pt-COD), Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate ≥ 37.50% (H2PtCl6. 6H2O), Isooctane 99% (C8H18), Sodium borohydride 99.99% (NaBH4), Nafion 5 wt %, were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Synperonic™ 91/5 (C19O6H40) was purchased from CRODA. Nitric acid 69.3% (HNO3), Isopropyl alcohol 99.9% (C3H8O) were supplied by Fisher Scientific, Sulfuric acid H2SO4 (93–98%) was purchased from Fermont."
3,Formulation of bicontinuous microemulsion and synthesis of Pt hierarchical superstructures (PtHSs),"2.2 Formulation of bicontinuous microemulsion and synthesis of Pt hierarchical superstructures (PtHSs) The preparation of BCME was carried out in 20 mL glass vials. The proper amount of (1,5-cyclooctadiene)dimethylplatinum(Ⅱ) (Pt-COD) was weighed and dissolved in isooctane to give a final mixture containing 1 wt % of Pt in the oil phase. The BCME was then formed using 27.36% Synperonic™ 91/5, 20.64% Milli-Q water and 52% Isooctane (with 1 wt % Pt). The mixture was subjected to vortex agitation for few seconds, resulting in a transparent, fluid, optically isotropic liquid phase. Characterization of the microemulsion by electrical conductivity as a function of temperature is discussed in Supporting Information (Fig. 1S). The reaction vial was maintained at 22 °C. Thereafter, 1 mL of sodium borohydride solution with an appropriate concentration was prepared. 100 μL of the reducing agent was withdrawn (corresponding to a 2:1 NaBH4: Pt stoichiometry) and slowly added to the ME in a period of 2 s, and then vortexed. The final mixture was kept at 22 °C without mechanical agitation for 48 h (Fig. 1 A and B). The platinum hierarchical nanostructure (PtHSs) formed was denoted as PtH–O. The same procedure was followed using Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate as Pt precursor instead of Pt-COD. The platinum hydrophilic salt was dissolved in Milli-Q water. Final concentrations of 2 and 4 wt % of Pt in the aqueous phase of the BCME containing 20.64% aqueous phase, 27.36% Synperonic™ 91/5, and 52% Isooctane were prepared. PtHSs synthesized using 2 and 4% of the water-soluble Pt precursor are denoted as PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 respectively."
4,Recovery and isolation of PtHSs,"2.3 Recovery and isolation of PtHSs The microemulsion fraction containing the PtHSs was dissolved in isopropanol, while the other part free of PtHSs by visual inspection, was decanted and discarded. The precipitate was then washed with Milli-Q water and Isopropanol six times. An acidic solution containing HNO3: H2O at a 50:50 wt ratio was used to wash the obtained product. Additional washing was done using Milli-Q water until a neutral pH was recorded. The PtHSs obtained were then allowed to dry at 22 °C and used for further characterization as reported in this study."
5,Characterization of PtHSs,2.4 Characterization of PtHSs The morphological studies were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS). The shape and size analysis of PtHSs was examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The crystalline structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Surface analysis was carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Further details can be found in Supporting Information.
6,Electrochemical characterization of PtHSs,"2.5 Electrochemical characterization of PtHSs A three-electrode cell with glassy carbon as working electrode (GCE), counter electrode (platinum mesh) and Mercury/Mercurous Sulfate Reference Electrode, MSRE, (Hg|Hg2SO4) was used to carry out cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and impedance analysis. High-purity nitrogen gas was bubbled into the electrolyte for 15 min prior to electrochemical activities. This was done to remove dissolved oxygen. The cell was connected to a CH Instruments 760E Potentiostat/Galvanostat. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The working electrode was polished using alumina powder suspensions of different grades (1 μm, 0.3 μm and 0.1 μm). CV measurements were carried out in a range of −0.66 to 0.84 V vs MSRE in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. From the dry PtHSs samples, a separate dispersion of PtH–O, PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 in 150 μL final solution of isopropanol and water (2:1) was prepared and ultrasonicated for a few seconds. The dispersion was added to the glassy carbon surface of the working electrode and covered with a 5 μL of 0.05 wt% Nafion suspension, before electrochemical measurements were performed. Hydrogen evolution reaction activity of PtHSs was investigated by LSV, chronoamperometry test, both carried out in N2 saturated aqueous solution of 0.5 M H2SO4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out on a PARSTAT 4000A potentiostat with VersaStudio 2.60.6 software. All the potentials used in this work were converted to the potential relative to reversible hydrogen electrode [ERHE = EMSRE + 0.0591 pH + 0.641] [41]. iR correction (Ecorr = Emea -iRu) was done on all the potentials. Ecorr is the iRu-compensated potential, Emea is the experimentally measured potential and Ru is the resistance of the electrolyte obtained by the IR compensation function of the CHI 440C electrochemical workstation. LSV measurement was done at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 from a potential of −0.66 to −0.84 V vs Mercury sulfate reference electrode (MSRE). EIS experiments were performed at different potentials (−35 to −85 mV vs RHE), with the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 kHz and an amplitude of 5 mV."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Morphological and structural analysis,"3.1 Morphological and structural analysis The morphological, shape and structural arrangements of the three platinum hierarchical superstructures (PtHSs) synthesized in this work, PtH–O, PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 are shown. Fig. 2 and Fig. 2S show the SEM images based on the different magnifications used. This is helpful in understanding the relationship between the different lyophilic platinum precursors used and the resulting hierarchical structural arrangement. Bicontinuous microemulsion channels serve as an interconnected reaction nanocage for the nucleation, growth and structural arrangement of PtHSs [30]. Fig. 2a reveals the dense packing of continuous interconnected 3D-mesh nano-meso-macroarchitecture of PtH–O. This will facilitate easy transport of mass and electrical charge across the nanomaterial [42]. The SEM image of PtH–O at higher magnification (Fig. 2b) shows well-defined spherical shapes of around 20–95 nm leading to interconnected hierarchical 3D mesh arrangements. The spheres that formed the 3D mesh are made up of small nanoparticles, although these cannot be resolved by SEM. PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 also exhibited morphological superstructures that were hierarchically arranged as shown in Fig. 2 c-f. From the SEM images, it is observed that PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 have a unique 3D network of interconnected spheres (48–237 nm) made up of self-assembled nanoneedles forming a nanocoral shape, although this is more prominent in PtH-A4 (Fig. 2f). The inset in Fig. 2 e and f, accurately illustrates the shape represented by both nanostructures of PtH-A2 and PtH-A4. The different structures obtained from the PtHSs suggest that the type of Pt precursor (oil-soluble or water-soluble) had a direct effect on the morphology of the products obtained. The morphology of the materials synthesized in this work is in conformity with the inherent nature of the bicontinuous microemulsion in which both aqueous and oily continuous domains exist as interconnected sponge-like channels [28]. Schemes 1 and 2 illustrate that our reaction method was able to direct the nucleation, growth and self-assembly sequence of the materials. Also, since microemulsions can behave as nanoconfined reaction media [43], the growth of the nanostructures was tailored to conform to the BCME nanochannels. As long as the metal precursor is fully dissolved in the appropriate phase, reduction to the zerovalent state is facilitated by reactant diffusion within the channels [43]. Furthermore, the purity and elemental constituents of PtH–O, PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Identification as well as quantification of elements in nanomaterials is one of the main uses of EDX technique [44]. The EDX spectra displayed the Pt content in the nanomaterials as ranging from 87 to 100% (Fig. 3S). The absence of other elements showed that our synthesized PtHSs is without impurities nor residual surfactant from the synthesis procedure, aside the elemental carbon from the carbon tape used in the EDX measurement."
9,TEM analysis,"3.2 TEM analysis The TEM images provide deeper insight into the PtHSs nanomaterials nature, morphology, shape, size and d-spacing [45]. The latter is usually determined from high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image. The hierarchical and interconnected arrangement of nanospherical materials making up PtH–O, as well as the nanoneedle-like nature of both PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 were confirmed using the TEM micrographs (Fig. 3 A, C and E). High-resolution TEM images of the nanomaterials were recorded (Fig. 3B, D and F) and well-defined fringes were observed. The HRTEM micrographs indicated that PtHSs (PtH–O, PtH-A2 and PtH-A4) are crystalline and the interplanar distances were measured to be 0.2270, 0.2269 and 0.2261 nm for PtH–O, PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 respectively. This corresponds to the (111) interplanar distance (2.265 Å) of the face-centered-cubic platinum nanomaterials, obtained from the reference Pt XRD pattern of JCPDS File No. 04-00-0802. The TEM images showed that the PtH–O is made up of abundant continuous arrangement of nanomaterials exhibiting a 3D-mesh hierarchical morphology made up of primary spherical NPs with an average size of 6.52 ± 1.42 nm. PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 TEM images displayed interconnected needle-based nanocoral morphology. The average diameter and length of PtH-A2 was found to be 3.26 ± 0.92 nm and 5.82 ± 1.71 nm respectively, while PtH-A4 had an average diameter of 3.21 ± 0.85 nm, and an approximate length of 7.34 ± 2.41 nm (Fig. 3). The PtHSs are majorly pure Pt nanostructures, as confirmed by the EDX analysis (Fig. 3S)."
10,X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis,"3.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis Determination of the phase distribution, crystallinity and purity of synthesized PtHSs were carried out using an XRD diffractometer. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the different nanostructures (PtH–O, PtH-A2 and PtH-A4) synthesized in this work. The PtHSs patterns confirm the polycrystalline nature of the platinum nanomaterials. Diffraction peaks at approximate 2θ values of 39.81°, 46.28°, 67.61°, 81.40°, 85.97° were observed in all the samples. These are assigned to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) crystal planes which can be indexed to the face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure of Pt (JCPDF No: 00-004-0802) [10]. The peak at the (111) crystal plane has the highest intensity in all three platinum samples. This signifies that the growth of PtHSs is predominantly along the (111) plane directions. This is also confirmed by the HR-TEM analysis (Fig. 3). The XRD obtained for the 3 samples showed the same peak pattern, indicating that the two different platinum precursors (oil and water-soluble) produced crystalline platinum nanomaterials of high purity. The absence of other peaks in the XRD spectrum confirms this. We suggest that the bicontinuous microemulsion method is not only efficient in achieving nanomaterials of predictable shape but also highly crystalline and pure platinum samples. The crystallite mean sizes (d XRD) of PtHSs were estimated from the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of each peak (see Table 1S) using the Debye Scherrer equation (Eq. (1S)) [46]. PtH–O has the largest mean size of 6.5 ± 0.6 nm, followed by PtH-A2 with 4.8 ± 0.5 nm and PtH-A4 with the smallest size of 4.5 ± 0.6 nm. These values are in close agreement to the values determined from direct inspection of HRTEM images (summarized in Table 2S), indicating that the crystallite size reflects the building unit of the hierarchical structures, and demonstrating the potential of our bicontinuous microemulsion reaction method to assist in the synthesis of hierarchical nanomaterials with small size of primary particles. It has been reported that nanomaterials having crystallite sizes less than 20 nm exhibit non-bulk properties [47]. Therefore, PtHSs synthesized in this work will be suitable for various purposes."
11,XPS analysis,"3.4 XPS analysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to analyze the surface composition and oxidation state of the as-synthesized Platinum hierarchical superstructures (PtHSs). The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 4S) shows the chemical composition of the PtHSs, displaying pronounced peaks of C, O and Pt. The presence of O1s signal may be related to the PtOx species as well as the adsorbed oxygen on the surface of Pt hierarchical superstructures (by exposure to ambient air) [48,49]. The binding energy at 284.1 eV corresponds to carbon state having sp2 hybridization. The O1s peak at about 531 eV corresponds to OH groups. At 1200 eV a wide line was observed, this is the Auger electron emission passing between KLL levels for carbon [50]. Cl 2p peak was not detected in the survey. This is usually seen at binding energy of approximately 200 eV. This shows that no unreacted water-soluble precursor (chloroplatinic acid) nor by-products were left. This suggests that our washing procedure was effective in removing any excess reactant or the complete reduction of the chloroplatinic acid precursor was achieved. This same result was reported by Sherrel et al. [51]. The XPS measurements recorded for the three PtHSs show the Pt 4f high-resolution spectrum as being deconvoluted into two pairs of doublets (Fig. 5 ). The shape of each 4f signals recorded in the PtHSs has the expected 4:3 peak area ratio, with 3.3 eV peak separation similar to XPS spectrum of Pt (0) nanomaterials reported in literature [52]. The doublets were observed at 71.4 and 74.8 eV, which represent the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 for PtH–O, PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 respectively (Fig. 5). This confirms the conversion of the platinum precursors to metallic platinum species Pt (0) [52]. The doublet at around 72.1 and 75.4 eV are assigned to Pt (Ⅱ) species such as PtO. These can be a product of the surface oxidation of Pt (0), especially during the sampling procedure for XPS analysis [48,52]."
12,Electrochemical surface area of the synthesized PtHSs,"3.5 Electrochemical surface area of the synthesized PtHSs Fig. 6 presents the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of PtHSs obtained by bicontinuous microemulsion reaction method, in 0.5 M H2SO4. CV measurements provide information about the electrochemical reactions that occur on a working electrode surface [53,54]. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is commonly used as a characterization method in determining the active area of Pt catalyst [55]. The CV curves were obtained using a scan rate of 50 mV/s at room temperature in nitrogen purged H2SO4 (0.5 M) solution. The characteristic of the CV curves (the well-defined hydrogen adsorption/desorption, double-layer charge, and monolayer Pt oxide regions) obtained for the PtHSs were identical in shapes and positions to each other as well as to the peak shape of typical Pt black nanoparticles reported in literatures [13,56–58]. This confirms the polycrystalline surface nature of PtHSs. The peaks shown at the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region of the CV suggest the presence of different exposed crystallographic planes [58]. The hydrogen adsorption and desorption cycles were observed below 0.365 V (vs. RHE). Oxidation of PtHSs to Platinum (Ⅱ) oxide occurs above 0.82 V (vs. RHE) and subsequent reduction of Pt (Ⅱ) oxide to Pt0 in the potential range (vs RHE) 1.0 V–0.4 V. This is known to be characteristic of Pt oxidation and reduction in aqueous solution [3,59]. Pt nanostructures reported by Ref. [57] gave a less defined oxide reduction peak. However, all the measured voltammogram of PtHSs in this work, displayed a well-defined oxide reduction peak which indicates efficient reducing activity of our PtHSs. A careful look at the voltammogram of PtH–O (Fig. 6) shows that the potential of its Pt-oxide reduction potential (0.71 V vs RHE) was higher than in PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 which is 0.7 V vs RHE respectively. ECSA values of the platinum hierarchical nanomaterials was estimated using the formula below, (1) ECSA = Q H ad Q ref where Q H is the average of the integrated charge associated with the Hads from the voltammogram of the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen on the CV curve (mC) and Q ref = 0.21 mC/cm2, corresponds to the charge associated to the formation of a monolayer of adsorbed hydrogen. Q ref represents a surface density of 1.3 × 1015 Pt atoms per cm2, for a polycrystalline Pt electrode [60,61]. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) of PtHSs were determined by measuring the charge (Q H) associated with the adsorption of hydrogen monolayer ( H + + e − ⇌ H ads ) between 0.015 and 0.365 V RHE [58,60]. The ECSA values of PtHSs determined using Eq. (1), are shown in Table 1 . PtH–O had the lowest ECSA value (8.7 m2/g) amongst the three hierarchical nanostructures synthesized. PtH-A2 having a nanocoral morphology made up of interconnected sponge/needle-like nanomaterials as shown in Fig. 2c-f, gave the highest ECSA value (35.1 m2/g) which is 1.68 times of the value for PtH-A4 (20.9 m2/g), and 4.03 times that of PtH–O. The highest ECSA value recorded in this work is higher than Pt dendritic tubes (23.3 m2/g) reported by Zhang et al. [60]. As described further in the HER evaluation, the catalytic ability of the nanostructures synthesized using water-soluble platinum (PtH-A2 and PtH-A4) are highly desirable. The ECSA value of the PtHS–O (8.67 m2/g) is higher than the highest value (5.9 × 10−2 m2/g) recorded for Platinum flower-like hierarchical micro/nanostructured synthesized using solvothermal method [57]. Ooi and Aziz, suggested that the presence of adsorbed amine derivatives hindered the active site [57]. We inferred that the surfactant, which performed as a template, is not attached to our PtHSs and was removed in the washing and cycling processes. Fig. 7 shows HER catalytic performance of PtH-A4, PtH-A2 and PtH–O. The polarization curve showed that the PtHSs synthesized by bicontinuous microemulsion exhibited good stability during the HER, with only a minimal cathodic current loss, before and after 1000 cycles, as shown in Fig. 7A–C. The measured HER current density was obtained by normalizing the current to the geometric area of the working electrode. Fig. 7D represents the overlay LSV curves of the PtHSs. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE) without the PtHSs showed no significant HER activity. At the current density at 10 mA cm−2 the electrocatalytic materials evaluated had different overpotential values for the RHE. The overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η 10) is important because it is a relevant parameter to evaluate solar-to-fuel conversion at 10% efficiency [62–64]. At this current density PtH–O had an overpotential of 101 mV. An overpotential of 98 mV was recorded for PtH-A4, while a lower overpotential of 68 mV was needed to achieve the same 10 mA cm−2 for PtH-A2. The η 10 achieved by PtHSs had lower values when compared to some reported Pt and Pt-based nanomaterials (Table 2 ). Lower overpotential values indicate a better electrocatalytic activity for HER [65] which may result from the high active surface area (ECSA value of 35.1 m2/g) exhibited by PtH-A2. In order to elucidate the reaction mechanism involved as well as identifying the rate-limiting step in the HER by the PtHSs electrocatalysts, Tafel plots were constructed [65]. It has been widely reported that, in acidic electrolytes, the mechanism involved in hydrogen production through HER [18,66], involves a two-step process. The initial step (rate determining step) is the Volmer reaction ( H 3 O + + e − ⇌ H ads + H 2 O [ discharge step ] ) . In the Volmer reaction, the surface of the working electrode adsorbs a proton from the acidic solution and forms an adsorbed hydrogen atom [67]. The next step is helpful in the desorption of the reactive intermediate Hads either by Tafel reaction ( 2 H ads ⇌ H 2 [ recombination step ] ) or Heyrovsky reaction ( H 3 O + + e − + H ads ⇌ H 2 + H 2 O [ electrodesorption step ] ) . Each mechanism can be related to a given value of the slope obtained from the Tafel equation η = a + b log j, where η is the overpotential (V), j is the normalized current density (mA cm−2), a is the intercept and b is the Tafel slope (mV dec−1). Slope values close to 30, 40 and 120 mV dec−1 represent Tafel, Heyrovsky and Volmer steps respectively. A slope value of 30 mV dec−1 translates to Volmer-Tafel mechanism which suggests coupled discharge-electrodeposition process and at 40 mV dec−1, Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, which implies coupled discharge-chemical desorption. As shown in Fig. 7 E, the Tafel slopes of PtH-A4, PtH–O, and PtH-A2 are 73, 38 and 30 mV dec−1 respectively. PtH-A2 had the smallest Tafel slope (30 mV dec−1) when compared with PtH–O and PtH-A4. As explained above, this indicates that the HER by PtH-A2 will follow the Volmer-Tafel mechanism, while the rate-limiting step will be the Tafel reaction [65]. In this case, the hydrogen evolution reaction proceeds through the combination of two adsorbed hydrogen atom on the PtH-A2 modified GCE surface to form molecular hydrogen. Small Tafel slope value also underscores the efficiency of electrocatalysts to function in HER at low overpotentials [65]. The Tafel slope of 38 mV dec−1 obtained for PtH–O, revealed that either the Tafel or Heyrovsky step controls the rate-limiting step, while Volmer step governs the rate-limiting step in the HER on PtH-A4 electrocatalyst. The long-term stability of the PtHSs was evaluated using chronoamperometry as presented in Fig. 7F. The inset in Fig. 7F is representative of the hydrogen accumulation and release that occur on the PtHSs catalysts during the stability assessment. This affects the H+/H2 concentration ratio on the electrocatalysts surface [66]. A degradation of approximately 15% was observed for the PtHSs over a duration of 4000 s at a potential of −85 mV vs RHE. This shows better stability than 40% reduction reported by Pt/rGO/GCE [66]. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was employed in the study of the electrochemical kinetics to determine the transfer resistance at the solid-liquid interface. The Nyquist plots recorded at −65 mV vs RHE are shown in Fig. 8 A. For all the electrocatalysts, the Nyquist EIS spectra were fitted by ZSimpWin 3.60 software. The experimental data (symbols) and the fitted data (solid curve) are closely correlated, showing only a small deviation at low frequencies. This could be a result of complex mass transformation [41] due to HER process kinetics [76] accompanied by electron transfer processes. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 8A (inset) and the Nyquist plot had two different semicircles. Rs is the electrolyte resistance, the arc at high frequencies is ascribed to the resistance of the adsorbed hydrogen atom (Rads), while the arc in the low frequencies region corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) [77], CPE1 (constant phase element) is the capacitance at higher frequencies which is suggested to be due to the hydrogen atom adsorption process, CPE2 is the double layer capacitance, while n1 and n2 are normally between 0 and 1, which represent the deviation from the ideal capacitance. In EIS, the phase angle can be represented by θ = (n–1)π/2; for a perfect resistor θ = 0 (n = 1), for a perfect capacitor θ = –π/2 (n = 0), and for a diffusion-like process θ = –π/4 (n = 0.5) [64,78]. These values were measured for PtHSs (Table 3S). The CPE also helps to reduce the deviation from the non-ideality of the electrocatalyst surface. The electrochemical values recorded for PtH-A2 modified electrode which include Rs, Rads, and Rct at an overpotential of −65 mV are 1.16, 3.65, and 3.39 Ω respectively. These values, when compared with reported works (Table 2) showed that PtH-A2 is a better electrocatalyst. The resistance values of the electrocatalysts (PtHSs) at −65 mV are summarized in Fig. 8B, in which the diameter of the semicircle at low frequencies obtained by simulated electrochemical fitting revealed the charge transfer resistance Rct of PtH-A4, PtH-A2 and PtH–O to be 3.00, 3.39 and 8.54 Ω, respectively. Smaller resistance values for Rct implies higher electron transfer and faster electrocatalytic reaction rate, and a good correlation is found between the values and the ECSA values determined [41,65]. We can deduce that PtH-A4 and PtH-A2 have faster electron transfer capability than PtH–O. This also shows that the higher surface area (35.1 m2/g) and the lower Tafel slope (30 mV dec−1) of PtH-A2 are well supported by a rapid electron transfer rate. In summary, PtH-A2 was found to be a better electrocatalyst compared to the other two nanomaterials tested in this work. Aside the Nyquist plot obtained at the overpotential of −35 mV, two arcs are observed at all the overpotentials (Figs. 5S–9S) which also confirms that the equivalent circuit was characterized by two time constants (high and low-frequencies region) [64,76]. As shown in Figs. 7S–9 S, the semi-circle at the low frequencies region was observed to decrease with increase in the applied potential, while the high frequencies semi-circle is not affected by the applied potential, which implies that the impedance values by the electrocatalysts are due to ohmic process [79]. Fig. 8C displays similar trend in the impedance value revealing that similar electrochemical process is involved at all the overpotentials. The electrolyte resistance (Rs) is less affected by the varying overpotential as well as the structural changes between each electrocatalyst. This implies the catalysts access the reaction medium with no significant obstruction experienced between the solid (electrocatalyst) and the liquid (solution). This is also corroborated by the equivalent circuit which fits well at all the potentials (Figs. 5S–9S) [80]. At higher overpotential than −45 mV, hydrogen bubble evolution is more intense on the surface of the electrocatalysts. In Fig. 8D, two distinct peaks can be observed from the Bode plot at −65 mV vs RHE. The Bode plot of other overpotentials are shown in Figs. 10S–14S. Generally, one peak was observed at the high frequencies and the other at low frequencies, these are well related to the hydrogen evolution reaction, and to the behavior of the electrocatalyst as shown in the equivalent circuit [41]. The θmax obtained at high and low frequencies region, with the exception of Bode plot at −85 mV, showed that PtH–O had higher Phase angle compared to both PtH-A4 and PtH-A2, indicating that the rate of H2 generation on PtH–O will be slower when compared to the other two electrocatalysts. In all the electrocatalysts used, no broadening of the phase diagram was observed, which suggests high hydrogen production rate. We explain the variation in the electrocatalytic ability of PtHSs based on the shape and size they possess. Firstly, from the SEM images in Fig. 2a, we observed that the shape of PtH–O is different from the shapes of PtH-A2 and PtH-A4 (Fig. 2c and e). We identified PtH–O as an interconnected array of spherical solid nanostructure. There is a complete change to aggregated and interconnected sponge-like or needle-like nanostructure producing a unique nanocoral morphology, when water-soluble precursors were used. In concept, catalytic area is proportional to the exposed area of platinum nanomaterial to sulfuric acid as well as the number of active sites on the surface of the Pt nanomaterials for hydrogen adsorption/desorption. We suggest that this interconnected hierarchical structural changes greatly improved the surface area, electron transport and consequently the catalytic ability of our synthesized nanostructures. Similar observation was reported by Zhang et al. and Jiang et al. [60,81]. Secondly, determination of the size of PtHSs from the FWHM using Scherrer equation, Table 1S, shows that PtH–O had the highest crystallite size than the others. We suggest that the size of PtH–O might play a role in the lower ECSA value it exhibited. This was also observed in the ECSA values of Pt nanoflowers prepared with diethanolamine as reported by Ooi and Aziz [57]. The effect of crystallite size is directly related to the catalytic ability."
13,Mechanism of formation,"3.6 Mechanism of formation The mechanism of formation of the nanomaterials synthesized in this work can be illustrated using Schemes 1 and 2. In principle, BCME offer the possibility to incorporate precursors into either the water phase or the oil phase. The chemical reaction between the reducing agent (NaBH4) and the platinum precursor dissolved in the oil (Scheme 1) or water (Scheme 2) channels of the microemulsion (which serve as a nanocage) forms Pt monomers immediately upon mixing. The monomer concentration increases up to the point of spontaneous nucleation (primary platinum particles), which occurs over a critical supersaturation concentration [C]C, followed by diffusion-controlled particle growth [82]. Surfactants stabilize the particles formed and their morphologies are directed by the bicontinuous microemulsion channels. There is an important difference between the method using lipophilic precursor versus hydrophilic precursor: in the first case, the reaction must be initiated and propagated at the oil/water interface, since the precursor is dissolved in the oil channels and the reducing agent is dissolved in the water channels; whereas, in the latter case, both reactants are dissolved in the aqueous channels, resulting in higher mobility of the ions and easier contact. This creates the appropriate interactive medium between the metal ion and the reducing agent. Equation (2) represents the chemical reaction taking place. The morphological arrangement showed that the structure is of nanocoral shape, when the reaction is carried out solely in the water channels. In the case of the lipophilic platinum precursors, where the precursor and reducing agent are in different phase, the reduction reaction will not easily proceed. This means there will be gradual alignment and self-assembly of the platinum particles formed based on the rigidity of the BCME structure and interface. The morphology showed that the resulting material had a unique interconnected and continuous arrangements between each consecutive nanomaterials. Each nanomaterial exhibits a spherical shape. This led to the hierarchical nature of the PtH–O (Fig. 2 a – b). (2) 2 PtCl 6 2 − + BH 4 − + 2 H 2 O → 2 Pt + BO 2 − + 8 HCl + 4 Cl − Equation (2): Chemical reaction between chloroplatinic acid and sodium borohydride [83]. Considering the composition of the bicontinuous microemulsions from this study, 20.64% aqueous phase, 27.36% Synperonic™ 91/5 and 52% Isooctane, it is feasible to imagine that the water channels must be narrower than the oil channels. In addition, Synperonic® 91/5, being a nonionic surfactant with 5 EO units, has the ability to become highly hydrated. According to Garti et al. and other authors, nonionic surfactants can bound up to 3 water molecules per EO unit in similar ternary or pseudoternary systems [84]. In fact, according to the BCME composition used, our microemulsions have an H2O: EO molar ratio around 3 (3.03 for PtH-A2, 2.9 for PtH-A4, and 3.2 for PtH–O). This means that all the water present in the microemulsions must be bound to the EO units from the nonionic surfactant. Which implies that not only must the water channels be narrower than the oil channels, but also, the water inside the channels must be more restricted, more structured as compared to molecules in the oil channels, because the presence of “free” water is unlikely. The metal ions from the precursors, are also more restricted as compared to the situation where the precursor is in the oil phase. The restriction imposed by the bound water in the BCME channels leads to the formation of a favoured arrangement, where the primary particles are smaller and the surface area is larger, as compared to the situation when oil-soluble precursors are used. Thus, we can conclude that synthesis of Pt nanostructures in our nonionic bicontinuous microemulsion system leads to a template effect when the water-soluble precursors are used. Which is not the case when ionic surfactant-based microemulsions (AOT, CTAB based) are used, as isolated or randomly agglomerated spherical particles are obtained [39,85]. Furthermore, as opposed to other inorganic hierarchical superstructures synthesized using BCME, there is no need for templating with a polymerized oil phase followed by impregnation and calcination to remove the template [40]. On the contrary, our approach is one-pot, soft, there is no need for any special equipment, and the liquid BCME template is removed simply by washings with conventional solvents including water."
14,Conclusion,"In this study, we synthesized platinum hierarchical superstructures (PtHSs) in bicontinuous microemulsion reaction medium (BCME). This was achieved using two different precursors based on their solubility preferences. It was observed that PtHSs fabricated using lipophilic and hydrophilic platinum precursor exhibited different morphologies, namely 3D mesh and nanocoral shape. SEM, EDX, HRTEM, XRD, and electrochemical techniques were used to study the morphological variations, crystallinity and electrocatalytic properties of PtHSs. The crystalline platinum superstructures were connected together in a manner directed by the interconnected network structure of BCME, demonstrating for the first time the template effect for the direct synthesis of metallic materials in BCME. The electrochemical functionality of the PtH-A2 showed a higher activity than PtH-A4 and PtH–O. A Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 was recorded for PtH-A2, indicating that Volmer-Tafel mechanism was observed in the HER. The PtHSs were stable over a long polarization of 1000 cycles. In general, the hydrophilic platinum precursor exhibited better performance. It is therefore promising to know that these unique structures synthesized by BCME facilitate the platinum properties that are of technological importance as novel catalysts and electrocatalysts."
