0,Introduction,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a pleiotropic molecule that plays a key role in the normal endothelial functioning [1]. Among other physiological actions, NO is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle cells relaxation and blood flow [2,3], thrombus formation [4], angiogenesis [5] and cell proliferation [6]. This plethora of actions has led to the development of several strategies for delivering NO locally from biomaterials for therapeutic purposes [7]. Topical NO delivery has been used, for example, for accelerating wound healing [8,9], killing bacteria in infected wounds [10], controlling blood pressure [11] and enhancing skin blood flow [12]. In the last case, topical NO delivery may find application for treating ischemic diseases associated with the downregulation of endothelial endogenous NO production, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy [13] and Raynaud's syndrome [14]. In both cases, transdermal NO delivery may increase vasodilation and restore the normal skin blood flow (SkBF) in the microvasculature. In diabetic neuropathy, improved perfusion may prevent the development of neuropathy, decrease existing neuropathic pain, accelerate the healing of existing ulcers and prevent infections [15]. In Raynaud's syndrome, these same NO actions might prevent digital tuft ulceration and necrotic gangrene. However, the rates and doses of NO delivered to tissues in topical applications are critical for obtaining the desired results, since at low concentrations (<1 μM) NO acts as an intracellular signaling species, activating or inhibiting different proteins, while at high concentrations (>1 μM), NO may exert cytotoxic actions though S- and N-nitrosation, nitration and oxidation reactions [16]. Although several polymeric biomaterials have been developed for controlled NO delivery, strategies for modulating the rate of NO release, as well as providing a mechanism for triggering NO release at the desired moment, remain important challenges [17]. To overcome these challenges, many studies have explored distinct strategies over the release-system, including supramolecular hydrogels [18], NO-derived prodrug synthesis [19], and incorporation into nanoparticles [20] and hydrogels matrices [21]. Other methods of NO synthesis such as enzyme-prodrug therapies [22], including the localized conversion of endogenous NO donors [23], are powerful but not applicable in the case of topically applied biomaterials, due to restricted access of prodrugs from blood to the wound or skin surface. In this work, we designed a NO donor-terminated polymer which allows a controlled loading and release of NO for topical applications. We used poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), a water-soluble non-ionic polymer that gives rise to biocompatible hydrogels with diverse uses in biomedicine. Specifically, PVA hydrogels are used in tissue engineering, production of embolic bodies, and assembly of vascular grafts [24]. PVA is popular as a polymer for electrospinning from aqueous solutions to produce biomaterials [25], specifically for wound dressing. In our recent studies, we obtained PVA via the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization [26]. RAFT affords excellent control over the polymer molar mass, endows the polymer chains with terminal groups amenable for bioconjugation and functionalization and RAFT-derived terminal groups have previously been modified to serve as NO donors using polymers and micelles [27]. We hypothesized that this strategy is well suited for the design of NO-releasing biomaterials and investigated this opportunity by synthesizing the first S-nitrosothiol-terminated PVA (PVA-SNO), whose SNO ends are capable of releasing NO spontaneously upon hydration. Differently from previously reported crosslinked PVAs with pendant sulphydryl (SH) groups [9,12], the precursor SH-terminated PVA (PVA-SH) herein described, is water-soluble and allows blending with native PVA. Blended PVA/PVA-SH films, which can be converted into blended PVA/PVA-SNO films, emerges thus as a novel strategy for modulating the SNO charge and NO release profile of the films and, in turn, the SkBF response in their topical application. Herein, we present results of this study, including polymer synthesis, blending and characterization, and illustrate controlled loading and release of S-nitrosothiol (SNO) groups and the SkBF response ensuing from the topical application of PVA/PVA-SNO films. Results of this study broaden the use of an already well-established biomaterial, PVA, which was engineered to incorporate a NO-releasing functionality using readily available tools, without sophistication of design."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Vinyl acetate (MW 86, 99%), 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) 98%, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (nominal Mw 85,000–146,000, 99% hydrolyzed), acetone, methanol, n-heptane, hydrazine monohydrate 98%, O-ethyl xanthic acid potassium salt, N-(Bromomethyl)phthalimide, chloroform, n-heptane, methanol, hydrazine monohydrate, sodium hydroxide, anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), sodium nitrite (NaNO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl) 37%, 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride (≥98%), (5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), phosphate buffer saline, (PBS), pH 7.4, poly(ethylene oxides) (PEO), ninhydrin and deuterium oxide (D2O), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chem. Co. Ultrapure water (resistivity 18.2 MΩ cm), was obtained from a Milli-Q purification system and used in all procedures."
3,O-ethyl-S-(phthalimidylmethyl) xanthate synthesis,"2.2 O-ethyl-S-(phthalimidylmethyl) xanthate synthesis O-ethyl xanthic acid potassium salt (1.03 g, 6.4 mmol) was suspended in chloroform (20 mL) in a dry two-necked round-bottomed flask. N-(bromomethyl)phthalimide (1.00 g, 4.2 mmol) in chloroform (20 mL) was added dropwise under stirring. The solution became pale yellow and KBr precipitated as the reaction proceeded. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 18 h and the end of the reaction was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography, TLC (product Rf = 0.60, iodobismuthate detection), run on 5 × 5 cm silica gel 60G F254 plates (Merk) with acetone:chloroform 1:1 v/v as the eluent, using a 1.2 × 10-1 mol/L chloroform solution of the product [28]. Additional chloroform (20 mL) was added prior to washing with deionized water (2 × 50 mL) and brine (1 × 50 mL). The solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and the solvent was removed from the filtrate by rotary evaporation yielding O-ethyl-S-(phthalimidylmethyl) xanthate as a solid (yield = 98%). 1H NMR [400 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C] δH: 1.36–1.44 (CH 3 CH2-), 4.57–4.67 (CH 3 CH2-O), 5.26–5.30 (N-CH 2 -S), 7.66–7.72 (aromatic H), 7.78–7.84 (aromatic H) (Fig. S1) [28]."
4,Amino-terminated PVA (PVA-NH2) synthesis,"2.3 Amino-terminated PVA (PVA-NH2) synthesis Vinyl acetate (4.68 g, 54.4 mmol), O-ethyl S-(phthalimidylmethyl) xanthate (78.7 mg, 0.28 mmol), and AIBN (4.60 mg, 0.028 mmol) were mixed in an ampoule and degassed by five freeze-pump-thaw cycles. The ampoule was next flame-sealed under vacuum and incubated at 60 °C for 13.5 h. After incubation, the ampoule was opened and the crude PVA- O-ethyl S-(phthalimidylmethyl) xanthate (PVA-Phth) was dissolved in acetone and precipitated in n-heptane to remove the ethyl xanthate byproduct. The precipitate (3.35 g, yield > 80%, 1H NMR) was collected and dried under vacuum. The dry product (3.15 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of methanol and hydrazine monohydrate (0.37 g, 7.40 mmol) was added to remove the phthalimide group under stirring at 60 °C for 30 min, yielding amino-terminated poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc-NH2). The reaction was quenched with hydrochloric acid 1 M and the PVAc-NH3 + Cl− was precipitated in water, washed with water and vacuum-filtered. The removal of the phthalimide group was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. The saponification of PVAc-NH2 into PVA-NH2 was performed by dissolving the PVAc-NH2 in a mixture of methanol (3 mL) and NaOH 40% (1 mL) overnight, under stirring. The precipitated PVA-NH2 (1.83 g) was vacuum-filtered, washed with methanol and dried under vacuum overnight. The PVA-NH2 was further characterized by the ninhydrin assay. A ninhydrin stock solution was prepared by dissolving 17.5 mg of ninhydrin in 5 mL of milli-Q water (0.02 mol/L). Then, 50 μL of PVA-NH2 solution (160 g L−1) was mixed with 950 μL of ultrapure water and mixed with 1 mL of the ninhydrin stock solution. The solution was heated to 90 °C for 10 min and next cooled down to 25 °C. The blue ninhydrin chromophore formed, with maximum absorption at 570 nm, was characterized by UV–Vis spectrophotometry using a diode-array UV–Vis spectrophotometer (model 8453 Hewlett-Packard/Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA)."
5,PVA/PVA-NH2 blending,"2.4 PVA/PVA-NH2 blending Native commercial PVA and PVA-NH2 solutions were previously prepared by dissolving the polymers separately in water under reflux at 90 °C for 30 min. The PVA-NH2 solution (15 wt%) and native PVA solution (20 wt%) were mixed at PVA:PVA-NH2 volume ratios: 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 inside wells of a 24-wells polystyrene tissue culture plate (500 μL/well), homogenized by manual stirring and allowed to dry in an oven at 60 °C for 45 min, leading to thin films adhered to the bottom of the wells."
6,Sulphydryl-terminated PVA (PVA-SH) synthesis,"2.5 Sulphydryl-terminated PVA (PVA-SH) synthesis The blended PVA/PVA-NH2 films were converted into blended PVA/PVA-SH films (where PVA-SH represents 4-imino-4-amino-PVA-butane-1-thiol), through the heterogeneous reaction between the blended PVA:PVA-NH2 films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 prepared by casting on the bottom of the wells of the 24-wells polystyrene tissue culture plate, and aqueous 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride solution 20 mg mL−1 (500 μL/well) at room temperature, during 16 h. The blended PVA/PVA-SH films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 formed were further detached from the bottom of the wells with tweezers and abundantly washed with distilled water. The sulfhydrylation reaction was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and by the Ellman assay by incubating PVA-SH previously dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4, under reflux at 90 °C for 30 min, with DTNB (2 mM in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4), protected from light."
7,S-nitrosation of blended PVA/PVA-SH films,"2.6 S-nitrosation of blended PVA/PVA-SH films Blended PVA/PVA-SH films were S-nitrosated by immersion into nitrous acid (HONO) solution freshly prepared by the acidification of NaNO2 solution with HCl (final concentration 24 mmol L−1) for 5 min at room temperature. The films were subsequently rinsed with 30 mL of deionized water each to remove the HONO excess. The blended films of PVA with S-nitroso 4-imino-4-amino-PVA-butane-1-thiol (PVA-SNO) with mass ratios 70:30, 50:50, and 30:70, are designated as PVA/PVA-SNO films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70, respectively. The formation of SNO groups was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectrophotometry, based on the characteristic absorption band of the SNO group at 550 nm [12]. For the spectrophotometric characterization, PVA-SH was previously dissolved in water under heating at 90 °C for 30 min and molded by solvent casting on the cavity of a Hellma demountable quartz cell with detachable windows (0.2 mm pathlength). UV–Vis spectra of the PVA-SH film adhered on the cell were obtained before and after S-nitrosation in the 200–400 nm range."
8,Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,"2.7 Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 1H NMR and 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) spectra were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for hydrogen using 5 mm OD tubes. All samples were previously dissolved in D2O at 80 °C for 10 min, cooled down and analyzed at 25 °C. The HDO peak assignment was determined based on a standard calibration curve as described by Gottlieb et al. [29]. 1H NMR spectra were used to characterize the formation of PVA-NH2, PVS-SH, PVA-SNO and PVA-S-S-PVA (formed in the NO release reaction of PVA-SNO). To estimate the number-average molar mass (Mn) of the PVAcPhth, PVA-SH and PVA-S-PVA, we identified the end-group resonances of each sample that are not overlapped with the polymeric repeating units. The end-group resonance from 7.8 to 7.6 ppm were integrated as 1 for PCAcPhth, and the resonance at 2.72 ppm was integrated as 2 for PVA-SH and as 4 for PVA-S-S-PVA. The number of -CH2- repeating units of PVA group was then calculated based on end-group integration. We compared the peak areas of the end groups of the PCAcPhth (phthalimide aril-H) and PVA-SH (-NHC(NH2Cl)CH2CH2CH2-SH), and the protons of the head to head linkage -(NHC(NH2Cl)CH2CH2CH2-S-S-CH2CH2CH2 (NH2Cl)NH-) of PVA-S-S-PVA, with the those of the -CH2- repeating units of PVA."
9,Vibrational spectroscopy,"2.8 Vibrational spectroscopy Infrared spectra of dry native PVA and PVA-NH2 films were obtained in Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) mode on a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer Cary 630 (Agilent, Santa Clara CA, USA), fitted with a diamond crystal type II ATR accessory (penetration 2 mm, active sampling diameter 200 mm), in the range of 4000–400 cm−1."
10,Scanning electron microscopy,"2.9 Scanning electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for the morphological analysis of PVA/PVA-SH films. All samples were previously coated with a 5 nm carbon layer and examined with an electron microscope (Jeol JSM 6360 L V - Tokyo, Japan) operating at 2 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra and mapping were obtained at 5 kV, under 300× magnification, process time 4 s, dwell 80 μs, binning 4 and mapping speed 3 μs."
11,X-ray diffraction,"2.10 X-ray diffraction An X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu model XRD7000), operating at 40 kV with CuKa radiation (0.154 nm), was used to obtain diffractograms of dry PVA and PVA-NH2 films in the 2θ range of 5–50°. The films were prepared by casting as above described and further dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h, prior to X-ray analysis."
12,Differential Scanning Calorimetry,"2.11 Differential Scanning Calorimetry PVA-NH2, PVA-SH and PVA-S-S-PVA films, were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) using a TA Instruments calorimeter (model Q100, New Castle, DE, USA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, under argon atmosphere. PVA-NH2 and PVA-SH films were prepared by casting as above described. For obtaining a PVA-S-S-PVA film, a freshly S-nitrosated PVA-SNO film was irradiated for ca. 4 h with visible light using a 780 lumens LED lamp with fiber optic cable (Fiber Optic Illuminator model LMI- 6000, Dolan-Jenner Industries, Boxborough, MA, USA), for total photochemical NO release. All samples were previously dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h before DSC analysis. The thermograms were obtained in the range of 0 °C–200 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1."
13,Real-time NO release,"2.12 Real-time NO release Real time NO release from PVA/PVA-SNO films was monitored by chemiluminescence with a NO analyzer (NOA, Sievers 280i, GE Analytical instruments, Boulder, CO, USA) operating with 6.0 psig of O2 and 7.2 Torr of N2. Freshly S-nitrosated discs of PVA/PVA-SNO films (0.5 mm thick by 8 mm diameter) were put into a polypropylene mesh bag, which was immersed in 10 mL of PBS solution, pH 7.4 at 37 °C, contained in the reaction flask of the NOA, protected from room light. The real-time NO release curves were integrated and expressed as cumulative NO released over time. Chemiluminescence was also used to quantify the total amount of SNO groups per gram of freshly S-nitrosated PVA/PVA-SNO films (expressed as μmol g−1), based on the ascorbate method. In all measurements the NOA was previous calibrated using the NaNO2/KI/CH3COOH method [30]."
14,Laser Doppler flowmetry,"2.13 Laser Doppler flowmetry Volunteers of the laboratory served as subjects for the in vivo evaluation of local skin vasodilation obtained in topical applications of blended PVA/PVA-SNO films, by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The experimental protocol used was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical School of the University of Campinas (Study Number 789.838). Skin blood flow perfusion measurements were carried out using a dual channel laser Doppler perfusion monitor, model BLF21D (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA), composed by an infrared laser diode (wavelength 780 nm, optical power output < 2 mW) and a flow probe type D1. The subjects stayed in the supine position on a bed in a thermoneutral room (21–22 °C) during the measurements. SkBF measurements started 15 min after acclimatization in the same position. Freshly S-nitrosated discs (0.5 mm thick by 8 mm diameter) of native PVA and PVA/PVA-SNO films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 were topically applied on the ventral forearm of the volunteers and held in place with an adhesive tape for 10 min. The SkBF was monitored for 10 min on the same site of application, immediately after the removal of the discs. Before applying the NO-releasing discs, the basal skin blood flow was recorded for 10 min on the same application site."
15,Statistical analysis,"2.14 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistica 8.0 software (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK). The data were analyzed by two-sided Student's t-test, and a statistical significance was set at the level of p < 0.05."
16,Results and discussion,
17,PVA-NH2 characterization,"3.1 PVA-NH2 characterization The RAFT polymerization of vinyl acetate in the presence of O-ethyl S-(phthalimidylmethyl) xanthate to obtain PVAc-Phth, followed by reduction with hydrazine to remove the phthalimide group yielding PVAc-NH2 and saponification with NaOH to yield PVA-NH2, are represented in Fig. 1 A (steps i, ii and iii, respectively). The formation of PVAc-Phth and its conversion into PVAc-NH2 were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, through the disappearance of the phthalimide aromatic protons (Fig. 1B, Fig. S2). The PVA-Phth obtained displayed a number-average molar mass (Mn) of 18.5 × 103 g mol−1 as estimated by NMR analysis. The presence of terminal NH2 groups in the PVA-NH2 was confirmed by the ninhydrin assay, performed with aqueous PVA (control) and PVA-NH2 solution. The development of the intense blue color characteristic of the presence of NH2 groups in the PVA-NH2 solution is shown in Fig. 1C. The 1H NMR spectrum of PVA and PVA-NH2 were essentially identical, as expected (δH 3.8–4.0 (-CH-) and 1.4–1.75 (-CH2-) (Fig. 1D and S3). Fig. 1E shows the vibrational spectra of solid native PVA and PVA-NH2. Native PVA displayed the characteristic bands of O-H stretching (H-bonded) at 3000-3300 cm−1, asymmetric C-H stretching of CH2 at 2938 cm−1, CH2 bending at 1416 cm−1 and C-OH stretching at 1091 cm−1. In addition to these bands, PVA- NH2 displayed the two well-defined weak peaks due to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations at 3403 cm−1 and 3278 cm−1, respectively, and a third peak at 3161 cm−1 (possibly due to the interaction between an overtone of the 1580 cm−1 band with the symmetric N-H stretching band), along with the in-plane NH2 scissoring absorption at 1635 cm−1, the C-N stretching vibrations in the range of 1000–1250 cm−1, and the out-of-plane wagging vibration at 814 cm−1, which are all characteristic of primary aliphatic amines [31,32]. Fig. 2A shows the X-ray diffractograms of solid native PVA and PVA-NH2 films in the 2θ range of 5° to 50°. It can be seen that both materials have the same X-ray diffraction pattern, with an intense diffraction peak with maximum at 2θ ≈ 20° and a weak peak at 2θ ≈ 41°, which are characteristic of PVA crystals [32]. The main diffraction peak at 2θ ≈ 20° corresponds to an interplanar distance of 4.5 Å, which is the distance between the planes of adjacent PVA chains associated by hydrogen bonds. The preservation of these Bragg diffraction peaks in the PVA-NH2 shows that the terminal –NH2 groups of the polymeric chains do not affect the chain packing in the crystalline phase. Fig. 2 B shows a schematic 2D fringed micelle representation of the semicrystalline structure that can be devised for the solid PVA-NH2, with -NH2-terminated chain endings in the amorphous domains of the material, forming an intertwined network with the crystallites."
18,Blended PVA/PVA-SH films characterization,"3.2 Blended PVA/PVA-SH films characterization Films of PVA-SH with different contents of terminal sulfhydryl groups were prepared through the heterogeneous reaction of blended PVA/PVA-NH2 films 30:70, 50:50 and 70:30 with iminothiolane, yielding blended films of PVA with 4-amino-PVA-butane-1-thiol (PVA-SH). The reaction (Fig. 3 A) was performed using PVA/PVA-NH2 films previously prepared by casting on the bottom of the wells of a polystyrene culture plate. The conversion of PVA-NH2 into PVA-SH in this heterogeneous process highlights the versatility of PVA films for functionalization reactions. Since the spontaneous physical crosslinking of PVA and PVA-NH2 films after casting renders the films insoluble in water at room temperature, chemical modifications of chain ends can be achieved by incubating the films with aqueous solution of the reagent. In this condition, the diffusion of the reagent through the amorphous phase of the films during the swelling process, allows further chemical modification of the chain ends. An additional advantage of this strategy is the easiness of purification of the material by simple washing or dialysis, and the possibility of optimizing the reaction yield by using an excess of the reagent. The functionalization of the PVA-NH2 chain ends with sulfhydryl groups, according to Fig. 3A was confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. 3 B) which revealed CH2 resonances centered at (a) 2.72 ppm for –CH2CH2 CH 2 SH, (b) 2.12 ppm for –CH2 CH 2 CH2SH, and (c) 3.13 ppm for –CH 2 CH2CH2SH, in addition to δH 3.8–4.0 (-CH-) and 1.4–1.75 (-CH 2 -), corroborated by 2D COSY 1H-1H NMR (Fig. S4). These findings are consistent with the resonance of terminal methylene protons adjacent to thiol groups. The presence of free thiol groups in the PVA-SH was also demonstrated through the Ellman assay (Fig. S5). [33]. SEM analysis of the surface of the blended PVA/PVA-SH films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70, showed that the blends have a dense and nonporous morphology in the micrometric scale (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3C also shows representative EDS mapping of sulfur atoms on the surface of blended PVA/PVA-SH films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70. Although EDS analysis does not allow a precise quantification of surface atoms, the sulfur mapping suggests an increase in the density of surface sulfur atoms with the increase in the PVA-SH content of the blends and is corroborated by the sulfur content estimated from the mapping (Table S1)."
19,S-nitrosation of PVA-SH,"3.3 S-nitrosation of PVA-SH Films of PVA-SNO with different contents of terminal SNO groups were prepared through a second heterogeneous reaction of the blended PVA/PVA-SH films 30:70, 50:50 and 70:30 with HONO (prepared by the acidification of NaNO2), yielding films of PVA blended with S-nitroso 4-imino-4-amino-PVA-butane-1-thiol (PVA-SNO). The reaction (Fig. 4 A) was performed using PVA/PVA-SH films previously prepared by casting on the bottom of the wells of a polystyrene culture plate. The 1H NMR spectrum of the PVA-SNO obtained, showed a significant deshielding effect of the -SNO moiety on the methylene protons of the S-nitroso-4-amino-PVA-butane-1-thiol end, confirming the S-nitrosation reaction. The resonances closer to the S-NO group underwent more intense shifts: 0.1 ppm for (a) –CH2CH2 CH 2 SNO and 0.064–0.76 ppm for (b) and (c) –CH2 CH 2 CH2SNO, respectively (Fig. 4B and S6). S-nitrosation was also confirmed by the UV–Vis spectrum of the PVA-SNO film prepared by casting on a quartz cuvette, which showed the appearance of the characteristic absorption band of the SNO group with maximum at 336 nm, assigned to π → π* electronic transition (Fig. 4C). Fig. 4D shows the total SNO amount (measured by chemiluminescence) in blended PVA/PVA-SNO films, after S-nitrosation of the parent blended PVA/PVA-SH films. It can be seen that the total SNO charge correlates directly with the relative amount of PVA-SNO in the blends, indicating a quantitative conversion of the SH groups into SNO groups. This evidence is reinforced by the observation that S-nitrosation times longer that 5 min did not increase the total SNO charge of the films. This is an expected result, considering that the films are thin and highly hydrophilic, allowing fast diffusion of the aqueous nitrosating solution into their bulk and that S-nitrosation of sulphydryl groups by nitrous acid, at the pH 1.6 used, is a fast reaction, which is completed in a matter of seconds [30]. The total SNO amounts ranged from 2.6 μmol g−1 to 6.0 μmol g−1 (Table S1), while the detection of 1.3 μmol of NO per gram of PVA in the control native PVA film submitted to the S-nitrosation process can be attributed to NO released from residual HONO absorbed by the film. Therefore, the NO released by the PVA/PVA-SNO films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 has also a contribution from residual HONO. The possibility of obtaining different SNO amounts in PVA/PVA-SNO films through blending may allow for different biological actions in topical applications, since relatively low local NO concentrations (in the pico-to nanomolar range) are reported to stimulate cellular proliferation and migration [34,35], as well as wound healing [36], whereas higher local NO concentrations (in the μmolar range) are associated with cell growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest, being appropriate for exerting microbicidal actions [37,38]."
20,NO release and skin blood flow response,"3.4 NO release and skin blood flow response The NO release reaction of PVA-SNO, forming S-S-bridged 4-amino-PVA-butane-1-thiol (PVA-S-S-PVA) is represented in Fig. 5 A. The 1H NMR spectrum of the PVA-S-S-PVA film obtained after total NO release, showed a return of the peaks assigned to the methylene protons of the S-nitroso-4-amino-PVA-butane-1-thiol to the chemical shift observed for the PVA-SH (Fig. 5B, S7 and S8), in accordance with the loss of the deshielding effect of the -SNO moiety on these protons. The thermal and photochemical release of NO from PVA films impregnated with S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and functionalized with SNO groups have already been reported in other studies [39,40]. Although PVA films impregnated with GSNO (which release free NO as a result of GSNO dimerization forming oxidized glutathione, (GS-SG), allow using different GSNO charges, water absorption by the films may also lead to the diffusion of intact GSNO molecules to the outer medium. Therefore, this kind of material provides a dual NO/GSNO release, whose relative doses of free NO and GSNO released may be difficult to control. In turn, in completely amorphous films of PVA functionalized with pendant S-nitrosothiolactic and S-nitrosomercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) moieties, the charge of SNO groups may only be changed by changing the extent of functionalization of the native PVA. In addition, PVA crosslinked by MSA is insoluble in water and cannot be blended with other polymers [12,41]. On the other hand, the PVA-SNO herein described is a water-soluble polymer, which allows blending and undergoes physical crosslinking through crystallization. In this semicrystalline material, the SNO-terminated chains are located in the amorphous domains, where the NO release reaction leads to the formation of intra and intermolecular S-S bonds (Fig. 5C). This mechanism of NO release is in accordance with the observed increase in the average molar mass from Mn = 16 ± 1.0 × 103 g mol−1 for PVA-SH, to Mn = 28 ± 3.0 × 103 g mol−1 for PVA-S-S-PVA, after total NO release, as estimated from the 1H NMR spectra. The S-S bonding of the polymeric chain ends in the amorphous domains of the PVA-SNO was also reflected in the shift of the glass-transition temperature (Tg), from 79 °C for PVA-NH2 and PVA-SH to 89 °C for PVA-S-S-PVA, after total NO release (Fig. 5D). This shift is in accordance with the expected reduction in the chain mobility of the amorphous phase due to the increase in chain size and the consequent reduction of free volumes, associated with chain ends [42]. We used chemiluminescence NO detection, where free NO released by the SNO groups undergoing dimerization is dragged in real-time by an N2 flux to the chemiluminescence detector, and the 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM) assay (Fig. S9), to demonstrate the ability of PVA/PVA-SNO films to release NO after their immersion in PBS solution, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. The dose-response kinetic curves of cumulative NO released by the PVA/PVA-SNO films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 are shown in Fig. 6 A. It can be seen that all films displayed a brief (ca. 5 min) burst release of NO immediately after the immersion in the PBS solution. After this burst release phase, which is likely due to residual free NO trapped in the films after the S-nitrosation process, the films started releasing NO at slower rates, which were directly proportional to the PVA-SNO content of the PVA/PVA-SNO blends. The rates of NO release extracted from the slopes of the initial sections (5–50 min) of the curves of Fig. 6A, varied from 1 to 12 nmol g−1min−1 (Table S1). Moreover, from 50 to 90 min, the NO release rates of the PVA/PVA-SNO films 30:70 and 50:50 were reduced from 12 to 6.5 nmol g−1min−1 and from 5.8 to 1.3 nmol g−1min−1, respectively, while the rate of the PVA:PVA-SNO film 70:30 remained unchanged. The small amount of NO released at a constant rate of 0.4 nmol g−1min−1 by the native PVA film used as a control (lower curve in Fig. 6A), can be attributed to the slow decomposition of residual HONO trapped after the S-nitrosation process. These results show that the initial rate of NO release of PVA/PVA-SNO films can be modulated in a 10-fold range by using different PVA:PVA-SNO mass ratios, providing a range of NO release rates which may be appropriate for applications demanding low or high NO doses. This is an important possibility, since the biological actions of NO depend strongly on its local tissue concentration and may either stimulate cellular proliferation, in the pico-to nanomolar range, or be cytotoxic, in the micro-to millimolar range [43]. The NO release rates from 0.4 to 12 nmol g−1 min−1 obtained for the PVA/PVA-SNO films is more ample than the range of 0.7–2.0 nmol g−1 min−1, recently reported for a NO releasing supramolecular poly(acrylic acid)/F120 hydrogel, which was shown to enhance wound healing [9]. Therefore, PVA/PVA-SNO films have also potential for improving wound healing. Moreover, the total SNO charge measured in the PVA/PVA-SNO films (Table S1), allows estimating that after 90 min, the PVA/PVA-SNO films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 released 3.3%, 11% and 36% of their total SNO pool, respectively. Assuming that the NO release rates would remain constant at the values measured in the 5–50 min interval, these films would be capable of releasing NO continuously for total periods of 2.4 h, 6.2 h and 2.8 h, respectively, with the PVA/PVA-SNO film 50:50 being capable of providing the most prolonged NO release in this condition. These periods are comparable, or even longer, than the periods reported for the full release of NO from other polymeric materials which displayed wound healig actions, such as 1-substituted diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolates incorporated into Pluronic F127 and branched polyethylenimine (4.1 h) [44] and crosslinked PVAs with pendant S-nitrosomercaptosuccinic acid moieties (0.5–2.8 h in the dark), which were shown to enhanced SkBF in topical applications [12]. As a prove-of-concept for the topical NO delivery from PVA/PVA-SNO films, we evaluated their capacity of enhancing the skin microvascular blood flow, when topically applied on the healthy ventral forearm skin of volunteers. We used the non-invasive optical technique of LDF, which provides a continuous measurement of the skin microcirculation. This measurement is based on the light scattered from moving erythrocytes in the dermis, which lead to a Doppler shift in the frequency of light back scattered to the probe and reflects the blood perfusion in the dermal vascular plexus, including capillaries, arterioles and venules [45,46]. The skin vasodilation response obtained after the topical application of freshly S-nitrosated PVA (control) and PVA/PVA-SNO films 70:30, 50:50, 30:70 for 10 min, followed by removal of the films and SkBF perfusion monitoring for subsequent 10 min, are shown in Fig. 6B.While the basal SkBF was not altered by the control native PVA film submitted to the same S-nitrosation process, the freshly S-nitrosated PVA:PVA-SNO films 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 promoted a 2-, 3.6- and 8-fold dose-response enhancement of SkBF, relative to the basal level, respectively. After removing the films from the skin, the SkBF gradually returned towards the basal level over the following 7 min of monitoring. In the particular case of the PVA/PVA-SNO film 30:70, a mild erythema was observed 5 min after the topical application (Fig. 6C). The skin blood flow enhancement obtained with the topical application of the PVA/PVA-SNO films can be attributed their release of free NO gas, which crosses the stratum corneum and the epidermis, reaching the vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) of the capillary bed of the dermis (0.3–3 mm depth) [47]. In this bed, NO exerts its vasodilatory action on the SMC by activation of guanylate cyclase, which leads to the reduction of intracellular calcium concentration via a cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent pathway, as well stablished since the seminal discovery by Furchgott, and Zawadzki [48]. Given the fundamental role of NO in the protection of the endothelium against vascular injury, and the serious consequences of endothelial disfunction in the pathogenesis of diabetic macro-and microangiopathy and neuropathy [49], the possibility of delivering NO transdermally from PVA/PVA-SNO films to the microvasculature, represents a potential treatment to prevent diabetic foot ulcers. Moreover, the possibility of tailoring the doses and rates of NO released from PVA/PVA-SNO films by using blends with different PVSA:PVA-SNO ratios, may allow for other therapeutic applications such as the acceleration of wound healing and the killing of bacteria in infected wounds [50,51]. We have shown in a previous study [12] that crosslinked PVA functionalized with pendant SNO groups of nitrosomercaptosuccinic acid, if previously dried by freeze-drying and stored under activated silica gel, is thermally stable for 45 days at 25 °C. This result suggests that, for practical purposes, the present PVA/PVA-SNO films may remain stable at room temperature for at least a similar period, if previously dried and stored under dry condition. Storage in a refrigerator and protection from room light are recommended for increasing the stability of this material."
21,Conclusion,"RAFT polymerization offers a strategy for synthesizing amino-terminated PVA (PVA-NH2), which can be next functionalized with iminothiolane yielding 4-imino-4-amino-PVA-butane-1-thiol (PVA-SH), and S-nitrosated yielding S-nitroso 4-imino-4-amino-PVA-butane-1-thiol (PVA-SNO). Blended PVA/PVA-SNO films with different PVA:PVA-SNO mass ratios are capable of releasing NO spontaneously in a dose-response manner, at rates ranging from 1 to 12 nmol g−1 min−1. Topical application of PVA/PVA-SNO films on the healthy skin may lead to a 2- to 10-fold increase in the skin blood flow, opening a perspective for their use in the treatment of microvascular diseases associated with reduced endogenous NO production."
