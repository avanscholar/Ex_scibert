0,Introduction,"As cleaner technology becomes a research priority for industry and academia, ionic liquids (ILs), a class of salts that are liquid at room temperature, have aroused widespread concern for their intrinsic advantages over organics. ILs show many attractive properties including chemical/thermal stability, ability to be recovered, negligible vapour pressure and especially their ability to be tuned for a specific task based on their fundamental properties [1–4]. Ionic liquids can be used in many areas of science. Zhang et al. reported on their use as electrolytes for lithium ion batteries [5], Wasserscheid et al. explored the use of ILs for transition metal catalysis [6], Brandt et al. reviewed the application of ILs to the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass [7], and other scholars studied the application of ILs in azeotrope separation [8–15]. ILs show great potential in separating azeotrope. Methanol, methyl acetate are widely used solvents. Dimethyl carbonate is an important organic synthetic intermediate for the molecular structure contains functional groups such as carbonyl, methyl and methoxide. The (methanol + methyl acetate) [16] mixtures present in the industrial manufacturing process of vinyl alcohol and (methanol + dimethyl carbonate) [17] mixtures present in the industrial manufacturing process of dimethyl carbonate. The separation of these two mixtures is meaningful. However, the separation of these two mixtures is quite difficult due to the formation of an azeotrope. Ordinary distillation will consume a large amount of energy and cannot result in high purity. Special separation methods such as pressure-swing distillation [18], extractive distillation [19], liquid-liquid extraction [9,20], membrane separation [21], are needed to separate these azeotropic mixtures. Among the separation technology, liquid-liquid extraction is an energy saving and environmentally friendly method, which is widely used in chemical industry. Solvent selection is the main consideration in the design a liquid-liquid extraction process [22,23] and temperature may have an effect on the liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) behaviour [24–27]. In this work, the phase behaviour for systems of {dimethyl carbonate/methyl acetate (1) + methanol (2) + 1-methylmidazole hydrogen sulfate ([MIM][HSO4])} (3) was studied. The LLE data for the two systems obtained at 298.15 K and 318.15 K under atmospheric pressure. Two important parameters, distribution coefficient (β) and separation factor (S), were calculated to assess the separation performance of [MIM][HSO4] in the LLE. In addition, the experimental values for the ternary systems were correlated by the non-random two liquid (NRTL) and universal quasi-chemical (UNIQUAC) models [28,29]. The UNIFAC-Lei model [30–32] was used to predict the LLE data of the systems studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Dimethyl carbonate, methyl acetate and methanol were purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. with mass fraction purity of 0.995, 0.990 and 0.998, respectively. [MIM][HSO4] was supplied by Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (with a stated mass fraction purity of 0.98). The purities of all the organic reagents were checked by gas chromatography (GC-2014C) and all the chemicals were used without further purification. The detailed information including source, purity and suppliers of chemical reagents is shown in Table 1 . An additional experiment was done to determine whether methanol reacts with [mim][HSO4] to form [mim][MeSO4]. The pH of studied mixtures did not change over time, indicating that no reaction took place between methanol and [mim][HSO4](see Supplementary Information)."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure The LLE for the systems of {dimethyl carbonate (1) + methanol (2) + [MIM][HSO4] (3)} and {methyl acetate (1) + methanol (2) + [MIM][HSO4] (3)} was determined at 298.15 K and 318.15 K under atmospheric pressure. The experimental procedure for the measurement of the LLE was described in detail in our previous work [33,34]. The mixtures were prepared by mass using electronic scales (FA-1204B, purchased from Shanghai Tianmei balance instrument co., LTD), and then placed into a 30 mL glass equilibrium cell [33] carefully. The glass equilibrium cell, containing a water jacket, was connected to a low temperature thermostat (controlled to 0.05 K). The mixtures were vigorously stirred for 3 h (about 1000 r/min) to ensure a good contact, and then the mixtures were settled down for about 15 h to get a complete separation."
4,Samples analysis,"2.3 Samples analysis After the complete separation of the two phases (organic-rich phase and IL-rich phase), samples were taken out from the upper and lower layers, respectively. The composition for methyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate and methanol was analysed by gas chromatography (GC). The GC (GC-2014C, SHIMADZU) is equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a packed column of Porapak Q (3 m × 0.04 m), a pre-column was equipped to prevent ILs from entering the chromatogram column, the carrier gas is high purity helium (>99.99%).The operating conditions are as follows: the temperature of injector and detector was set to 475.15 K and 503.15 K, respectively. The temperature of oven was 493.15 K. The analyses were carried out at least three times for each sample. Due to the non-volatility of ILs, the composition of ILs cannot be analysed by GC. The composition of ILs was analysed by a mass difference method for each sample, the volatile organic compounds were evaporated by a vacuum drying oven (DZF-6020, Shanghai Boxun, China) and the weight of each sample was measured accurately before and after evaporation. GC analysis of the evaporated samples showed that no water or organic content residue in the samples."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Experimental results,"3.1 Experimental results The LLE results for the systems of methyl acetate/dimethyl carbonate (1) + methanol (2) + [MIM][HSO4] (3) were determined at 298.15 K and 318.15 K under atmospheric pressure. The experimental results are given in Table 2 , and the experimental data and tie-lines of the ternary systems are shown in Figs. 1–4 . The ternary phase diagrams provided an intuitive visual for the phase behaviour. All the systems studied show Treybal type I behaviour. Methyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate are partially miscible in [MIM][HSO4], while methanol is completely miscible in methyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate and [MIM][HSO4]. All systems show an ample size of the immiscibility region for liquid-liquid extraction and the size of the immiscibility region shows a slight decrease with increasing temperature. The extraction performance can be characterized by the two important parameters, viz. β and S. β. The β is defined by the ratio of the concentrations of methanol in the IL-rich phase and in the organic phase, and S is defined by the ratio of the β of methanol and methyl acetate/dimethyl carbonate. The values of β and S were calculated from the experimental results for each system. The equations are as follows: (1) β = x 2 IL - rich x 2 org - rich (2) S = ( x 2 IL - rich / x 1 IL - rich ) ( x 2 org - rich / x 1 org - rich ) where x presents the mole fraction, subscript 1 represents methyl acetate or dimethyl carbonate and subscript 2 presents methanol. Superscript org-rich present methyl acetate-rich phase/dimethyl carbonate-rich phase and superscript IL-rich represents IL-rich phase, respectively. The calculated values of β and S for the {methyl acetate/dimethyl carbonate + methanol + [MIM][HSO4]} systems are listed in Table 2 for both 298.15 K and 318.15 K. The graphical representations are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively. The values of β and S are greater than unity for all systems, indicating that methanol has a greater affinity for [MIM][HSO4] than for methyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate. The [MIM][HSO4] is a suitable solvent for extracting methanol from methyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate. The values of β and S show a decreasing trend with the increase of xIL-rich 2. As can be concluded from Table 2, Figs. 5 and 6, [MIM][HSO4] is suitable for extracting methanol from methyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate. And the values of β and S show a slight decrease with the temperature increase."
7,Sigma profiles,"3.2 Sigma profiles The conductor-like screening model COSMO-SAC [23,35–37] was used to calculate the sigma profiles, which is a descriptor for the local polarity of molecular surface and determines the interaction energies. The calculated sigma profiles for the pure components are given in Fig. 7 . Two important vertical dashed lines (σ = ±0.000082 nm2) divide the sigma profile into three areas. Between the two vertical dashed lines is the neutral zone. The left side of σ = −0.000082 nm2 is hydrogen donor zone and the right side of σ = +0.000082 nm2 is hydrogen acceptor zone. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that methyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate lie mostly in the neutral zone and a small fraction of the profile lies in the hydrogen acceptor. However methanol and the [MIM][HSO4] compound define a much larger fraction of the profile in the hydrogen donor zone and hydrogen acceptor zone, thus the extraction ability of [MIM][HSO4] may depend on the hydrogen bond donor or acceptor ability. The negative (positive) σ of [MIM][HSO4] forms hydrogen bonding interaction with the positive (negative) σ of methanol, that may lead to the high solubility of [MIM][HSO4] than methyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate. The strong interactions between [MIM][HSO4] and methanol indicate the feasibility of extracting methanol from methyl acetate/methanol and dimethyl carbonate/methanol mixture."
8,Calculations,"3.3 Calculations The UNIQUAC and NRTL models were employed to correlate the experimental LLE data for the systems {methyl acetate/dimethyl carbonate + methanol + [MIM][HSO4]} at two different temperatures, The values of r and q for UNIQUAC were from the literature [38–40] and are given in Table 3 . The root-mean-square deviations (rmsd) between the experimental and calculated values were determined. The, binary interaction parameters for both models and the calculated rmsd values are given in Table 4 , The objective function (OF) and the rmsd equations are expressed as follows: (3) OF = ∑ k = 1 M ∑ j = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 3 χ ijk exp - χ ijk calc 2 (4) rmsd = 100 ∑ k = 1 M ∑ j = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 3 χ ijk exp - χ ijk calc 2 6 M 1 / 2 here M indicates the number of tie-lines, the x ijk exp and x ijk calc represent the experimental and calculated mole fraction, respectively, subscripts i, j, and k indicate component, phase, and tie-line, respectively. The tie-lines determined the by NRTL and UNIQUAC models are shown in Figs. 1–4, accordingly. Satisfactorily correlations were obtained for all the systems. The rmsd values are smaller than 0.0148 for NRTL model and smaller than 0.0180 for UNIQUAC, which can be seen in Figs. 1–4. The UNIFAC-Lei model was used to predict the LLE equilibria. The binodal curves predicted by UNIFAC-Lei are shown in Figs. 1 and 3. The predicted results by UNIFAC-Lei are in good agreement with the experimental values in the dimethyl carbonate system, while the predicted values by UNIFAC-Lei have a greater deviation from the experimental values compared to the calculated data by UNIQUAC and NRTL."
9,Conclusions,"Experimental LLE data for the ternary systems {methyl acetate + methanol + [MIM][HSO4]} and {dimethyl carbonate + methanol + [MIM][HSO4]} were obtained at 298.15 K and 318.15 K under atmospheric pressure. The values of β and S were calculated from the experimental tie-lines. The values of β and S were greater than 1 over the whole concentration range studied. Therefore, [MIM][HSO4] is a potential solvent for extracting methanol from methyl acetate/methanol and dimethyl carbonate/methanol mixtures. In the comparison of the separation performance for the two systems at different temperatures, it can be concluded that the extraction ability for [MIM][HSO4] decreases with temperature increase. The NRTL and UNIQUAC thermodynamics models were adopted to correct the experimental tie-lines, and satisfactory results were obtained for all systems studied systems. The predicted results by the UNIFAC-Lei model are not reasonable indicating the necessity of LLE experiments."
