0,Introduction,"High-energy demand, depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution have become major global challenges in recent years [1–5]. The utilization of clean and inexhaustible solar energy is essential to avoid the effects of greenhouse gases and to secure energy supply for the future. Thousands of research articles are published every year on the subject of solar energy conversion techniques such as photocatalytic degradation of emerging organic pollutants, hydrogen (H2) production via photocatalytic water splitting, photovoltaics, and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The photoelectrochemical water splitting by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 is one of the most significant of these [6]. Since then, H2 production via water splitting has become the most promising clean energy technology with minimal impact to the environment [7–9]. Titanium oxide (TiO2) [10–12], graphitic-carbon nitride (g-C3N4) [13–15] and cadmium sulfide (CdS) [16–18] are three extensively studied photocatalysts for water splitting in recent decades. Among them, TiO2 is more superior, and a benchmark photocatalyst owing to its photostability, high efficiency, appropriate band edge positions, biocompatibility and non-toxic nature [19–24]. The molecular orbital interactions between titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 1 . The “d” orbitals of Ti and “p” orbitals of O are mainly contribute to the bonding and antibonding orbitals [25]. The energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (i.e. CB) and highest occupied molecular orbital (i.e. VB) is known as bandgap energy (Eg). The bandgap energy of TiO2 anatase is ∼ 3.2 eV. The photocatalytic mechanism of TiO2 water splitting is illustrated in Fig. 2 [26]. Three significant steps are involved [26]: (1) absorption of photons (λ ≥ bandgap energy) and generation of electron-hole pairs; (2) separation and migration of electron or hole from the bulk to the surface (or recombination of electron-hole pairs in the bulk material); (3) photo-reduction (H+ to H2) and photo-oxidation reactions (H2O to O2) at the surface. The activity of a photocatalyst is strongly ruled by the kinetics of these three steps. H2 production rate of TiO2 is proportional to the quantity of photo-excited electrons at the water/TiO2 interface. The overall quantum yield is estimated from the number of incident photons and the number of H2 molecules evolved [27]. To facilitate an efficient water splitting, the CB minimum (CBM) edge of a photocatalyst should be smaller than the H+/H2 reduction potential (0 V vs. NHE) and the VB maximum (VBM) edge must be greater than the H2O/O2 oxidation potential (+1.23 V vs. NHE), respectively. The overall water splitting of TiO2 is comprised of two half reactions: (1) H 2 O + h+ VB → 2H+ + ½ O2 (2) 2H + + 2e − CB → H 2 The overall reaction: (3) H 2O → H 2 + ½ O2 The timespan of reactive species produced during TiO2 photocatalytic reaction is shown in Fig. 3 [28]. Interfacial charge transfer, recombination and trapping are the important photo-induced reactions inside and on the surface of TiO2. The time-span of the reactions was predicted with the help of time resolved absorption spectroscopy. Interfacial redox reactions are commonly responsible for the photo-degradation of organic pollutants. For photocatalytic H2 production, the efficiency of TiO2 is mainly ruled by the surface trapping reactions. Fig. 3 shows that the time-scale of surface reactions is very low (in the range of picoseconds to femtoseconds). Hence, the photo-generated electrons should be effectively utilized on the catalyst surface to avoid its recombination with holes in the bulk. Photocatalytic water splitting is energetically an uphill reaction (Gibbs free energy ΔH0 = 286 kJ mol−1) [29]. Consequently, the experiments are carried out in the presence of electron donors (sacrificial agents) such as methanol [30,31] (commonly used for TiO2), tri-ethanolamine [32,33] (commonly used for g-C3N4), sodium sulfide/sodium sulfite mixture [34,35] (commonly used for CdS) to avoid a backward reaction. The schematic of photocatalytic water splitting in the presence of sacrificial agents is shown in Fig. 4 . The photo-generated holes can be easily consumed by the sacrificial agents, owing to their less positive oxidation potential when compared to H2O. This would lead to the accumulation of photo-generated electrons on the catalyst surface for its reaction with H+. The important reactions for the photocatalytic H2 production using TiO2 - methanol system are given as follows [36]: (4) TiO2 + hν → e − + h + (5) e − + h + → Calor (heat) (6) H 2 O a d s + h + → O H • a d s + H + a d s (7) C H 3 O H a d s + O H • a d s ( h + ) → C H 3 O • + H 2 O a d s ( H + a d s ) (8) C H 3 O H a d s + O H - a d s → C H 3 O - a d s + H 2 O a d s (9) C H 3 O • + C H 3 O - a d s + H + → 2 C H 2 O a d s + H + + e - (10) C H 3 O • a d s + O H • a d s ( h + ) → C H 2 O a d s + H 2 O a d s ( H + a d s ) (11) C H 2 O a d s + O H • a d s ( h + ) → H C O • a d s + H 2 O a d s ( H + a d s ) (12) H C O • a d s + O H • a d s → H C O O H a d s (13) H C O O H a d s + O H • a d s h + → • C O O H a d s + H 2 O a d s ( H + a d s ) (14) • C O O H a d s + O H • a d s ( h + ) → C O 2 a d s + H 2 O a d s ( H + a d s ) (15) 2 H + a d s + 2 e - → H 2 Quantum efficiency (Q.E) is the generally recommended parameter to perform a quantitative comparison of a photocatalyst with other literature [37–42]. Q.E. is the ratio of number of H2 molecules produced and the number of photons interacting with the photocatalyst. The quantum and photonic (also called as apparent quantum efficiency) efficiencies can be determined as follows: (16) Q u a n t u m e f f i c i e n c y ( % ) = 100 × n × r ( m o l m - 3 s - 1 ) e a ( E i n s t e i n m - 3 s - 1 ) (17) P h o t o n i c e f f i c i e n c y % = 100 × n × r m o l m - 2 s - 1 × V ( m 3 ) q E i n s t e i n m - 3 s - 1 × A ( m 2 ) Where, n is equal to 1 or 2 depending on the photocatalytic mechanism, r is the rate of reaction, e a is the local volumetric rate of photon absorption (LVRPA - for liquid phase), q is the incident radiation flux averaged at the light irradiated photo-reactor surface (A) and V is the volume of photo-reactor. In most of the works, the value of n is considered as 2 (i.e. transfer of two electrons is required to produce one H2 molecule). Nevertheless, there is a possibility of “current doubling effect” [36,43–45] during the photocatalytic H2 production. In this situation, the hole scavenger (e.g. methanol) is altered into a radical anion intermediate (Eq. (8)) and then it injects an electron into the CB of TiO2 (Eq. (9)). Only one photon is required (i.e. n is equal to 1) to produce one H2 molecule when the “current doubling effect” is considered. Alternatively, the hole scavenger radical anion could react with the •OH radical to produce H+ (Eq. (10)). The wide band of pristine TiO2 is not appropriate to receive the visible light for practical applications [46,47]. Moreover, the quantum yield of pristine TiO2 is not remarkable even in the presence of sacrificial agents, because the H2 production efficiency of pristine TiO2 is influenced by high or unavoidable electron-hole recombination process at the surface or within the bulk [23,48–51]. Various strategies have been reported to tune the bandgap and regulate the electronic properties of TiO2, such as sensitization with dyes [52,53] or graphene [54,55], use of nanocomposites [56–58], and doping of metals [59–62] or non-metals [63,64]. Among these different approaches, doping with metal ions (the introduction of foreign elements without affecting the original crystallinity of TiO2) is the most promising option, since it directly influences the surface electronic characteristics of TiO2. Dopants can act as systematic electron taps, upgrade the electron-hole transfer/migration/separation, red shift the bandgap absorption to visible light, provide additional active sites for the photochemical reactions (especially H combination) at the surface and minimize the over-potential required for H2 evolution reaction. The outer shell electronic configuration, distribution and concentration of the dopants are very important in amplification of the H2 production efficiency of TiO2. Both anionic (e.g: C, N, S, F) [63–74] and cationic dopants (transition and inner transition metals, noble metals, rare earths) [61,69,75–100] have been used to tune the optical and electrical properties of pristine TiO2. Fig. 5 shows the list of dopants studied to enhance the H2 production efficiency of TiO2. Pt [101–108], Au [59,109–116], Cu [117–128], and N [63,64,67–71] are the most widely studied dopants because of their high work function. Table 1 summarizes the key findings of metal-doped TiO2 developed in recent years for H2 production [62,67,68,86,87,129–146]. The results showed that maximum H2 production is achieved when Cu, Au and Pt are used as dopants in the range of 1% - 5%. Xenon (Xe) arc and high-pressure mercury (Hg) lamps were commonly used as light irradiation sources for visible/simulated solar light and UV light irradiation respectively. It is also noted that the efficiency of TiO2 is significantly enhanced when more than one dopant is used. Most of the review articles in photocatalysis highlight the applications of TiO2 for environmental remediation (air pollution, water pollution, and self-cleaning surfaces) and microbial disinfection [152–164]. Some insightful review articles have been published for photocatalytic water splitting in numerous aspects such as fundamental concepts, theoretical principles, nature of photocatalyst (composition, shape, dimension, surface features and light absorption capacity), role of co-catalyst, role of sacrificial agents, photocatalysis mechanism, etc [50,165–179]. There are no comprehensive review articles on metal-doped TiO2 for H2 production. The main aim of this article is to review the recent advancements, key findings, and photocatalytic mechanisms of metal-doped TiO2 for H2 production."
1,Mechanism of metal doped TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 generation,"A schematic illustration of H2 production via TiO2 water splitting is shown in Fig. 6 . H2 production is accomplished through three important steps: (i) Under light irradiation, TiO2 absorbs light with energy equal to, or greater than, the bandgap energy and the electrons are excited from the VB to the CB [8,158,159,180]. Consequently, electron and hole pairs are created in the CB and VB, respectively. (ii) The photo-excited electron and hole can easily migrate to the surface of TiO2 (iii) hydrogen (H+) ions are reduced into molecular hydrogen (H2) by the electrons in the CB; H2O is oxidized into oxygen (O2) by the holes in the VB. Owing to the less positive oxidation potential, the sacrificial agents can react more quickly with holes than H2O. This would lead to the accumulation of electrons on the TiO2 surface for the photo-reduction. The metal dopants are generally acting in the following ways to enhance the charge carrier separation and spectral response of TiO2 (Fig. 7 ): • Electron trap mechanism • Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect • Incorporation of new energy levels • Generation of gap states by interaction with TiO2 VB states"
2,Electron traps mechanism,"2.1 Electron traps mechanism The electron trap mechanism is organized through the Schottky barrier formation [167,173,175]. The photo-generated electrons from the CB of TiO2 can easily migrate to the metal via Schottky barrier (i.e. a barrier formed at the semiconductor-metal interface, Fig. 8 ) [26] and the metal can as an electron sink. The surface band bending can occur via electron transfer when the semiconductor contacts with the metal [181]. Band bending is called as the shifting of energy band edges of a semiconductor due to the electric field/charge transfer between the semiconductor and the metal [182]. Electrons are generally transferred from the material with high Fermi level to that of low Fermi level until the thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved between the two (Fig. 9 ). Fermi level of metal is lower than the n-type semiconductor. Therefore, the electrons could transfer from n-type semiconductor to metal. This causes the development of an electron depletion region, suggesting the surface upward-bent band in n-type semiconductor. Conversely, the Fermi level of metal is higher than the p-type semiconductor. Hence, the electrons could transfer from metal to p-type semiconductor. This results the creation of hole depletion region, indicating the surface downward-bent band in p-type semiconductor. VS or built in electric field is positive for p-type semiconductor and it is negative for the n-type semiconductor. Consequently, the surface has an upward-bent band for n- type semiconductor and it has a downward-bent band for p-type semiconductor. The band bending also relies on the work function of metal and semiconductor. Fig. 10 shows the band bending of an n-type semiconductor (i.e. TiO2) and metal with different work function. An upward-bent band occurs toward the metal-semiconductor interface when the work function of metal is higher than that of semiconductor. Likewise, a downward-bent band occurs, as the work function of metal is lower than that of semiconductor [182]. The energetics of a metal-semiconductor system could be improved by shifting the Fermi level closer to the CB. The Fermi level shift is influenced by the degree of electron accumulation and the particle size of the metal nanoparticles [183,184]. Subramanian et al. [183] studied the Fermi level shift of TiO2/Au nanocomposites. The experiments were carried out with Au of different particle sizes. The Fermi level of a semiconductor is calculated by the following equation [183]: (18) EF = ECB + kT ln nc/Nc Where nc is the accumulated electrons density and Nc is the charge carrier density of the semiconductor. The Fermi level of TiO2 is shifted to a more negative position if more electrons are accumulated in the TiO2/Au nanocomposites. Fermi levels values were found to be −230 mV, -250, -270, and −290 mV for pure TiO2, TiO2/Au (8 nm), TiO2/Au (5 nm), and TiO2/Au (3 nm), respectively. The negative shift of Fermi level is an indication of high degree of electron accumulation, which also suggests a high charge carrier separation and reductive power of TiO2/Au nanocomposites [183,184]. Fermi level shift also depends on the metal work function, which is more significant in facilitation of the electron transfer from metal to H+ to produce H2. Generally, a metal with a high work function is preferable to achieve maximum charge carrier separation. When the work function of a metal is higher than that of TiO2, the Schottky barrier can be formed between CB of TiO2 and fermi level of the metal. In this case, the injected electrons are unable to flow back to TiO2. The work function of Ag, Cu, Rh, Au, Pd, and Pt are 4.26, 4.65, 4.98, 5.10, 5.60, and 5.93, respectively [177]. Owing to its high work function, Pt can serve as an effective electron trap to suppress the charge-carrier recombination process. A schematic representation of the charge carrier separation and transfer via Schottky junction using Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 11 [185]. When Pt and TiO2 are in direct contact with each other, the electrons are diffused from TiO2 to Pt to create an equilibrium state between fermi level of TiO2 (EfTiO2) and Pt (EfPt). This charge diffusion process would create an internal electric field and cause upward band bending (from TiO2 to Pt). Therefore, the Schottky barrier is established between the TiO2 CB and EfPt. Consequently, the electron-hole recombination process is minimized and the H2 production efficiency is increased. The surface of TiO2 is not an active site for atomic hydrogen (H•) absorption, leading to H2 production. The metal can also function as an active catalyst site to reduce the over-potential of H2 evolution. In the recent years, most of the water splitting research studies have been carried out using Pt (Fig. 12 ) or Au (Fig. 13 ) as a co-catalyst or metal dopant [186–191]."
3,SPR effect,"2.2 SPR effect Surface plasmons are the collective oscillations of free electrons confined to a surface in a conducting material [196]. It can interact strongly with light. SPR occurs when the frequency of incident light is equal to that of surface free electrons oscillating against the restoring force of the nuclei. The photonic energy can be transferred into thermal or electronic energy via radiative (converting plasmons into photons) and non-radiative decay (creates electron-hole excitation) of surface plasmons. The frequency of the SPR can be modified by the size, morphology, proximity and nature of the metal nanoparticles. An intense local electric field (called as “hot spot”) is created near the metal surface when the metal nanoparticles are irradiated near its plasmon resonance frequency. The electron-hole generation rate in the hot spot region is 1000 times higher than the incident electromagnetic field. Consequently, a higher amount of photo-induced charge carriers is generated locally in TiO2 by the plasmonic metal nanoparticles [197,198]. The relationship between the spectroscopy and dynamics of metal nanoparticles for plasmon induced photocatalysis was comprehensively described a recent study [199]. The results showed that the hot electron (high energy electron) generation and coupling of plasmon-molecular interactions are controlled by the nature of the material and shape of the nanocrystal. The relaxation process in metal nanoparticles and its influence in the photocatalytic process were reviewed in detail. Two mechanisms such as (i) a sequential excitation − charge-transfer and (ii) direct excitation of an interfacial charge-transfer were used to explain the charge transfer mechanism from a metal to the semiconductor in a plasmon induced photocatalytic process. An efficient photocatalysis process is generally occurred via the direct excitation of interfacial charge-transfer transitions, which can be studied by perceiving how localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) line width varies in the presence of surface bound molecules. Rayleigh light-scattering and elegant single-particle absorption techniques could be used to measure the LSPR line width. The total LSPR line width (Γ) can be written as follows: (19) Γ = Γb + Γrad + Γsurf = Γb + 2 ħkV + A (ν F/leff ) Where Γb denotes the direct bulk-like decay of LSPR into electronic and phononic excitations; Γrad describes the radiation damping (energy loss through scattering a photon); Γsurf represents the damping by electron surface collisions; ħ, k and A are the constants; V is the volume; v F is the Fermi velocity; l eff is the effective path length of electrons. Γb has contributions from the inter-band and intra-band (“Drude model”) transitions (20) Γb = ΓDrude + Γinterband The key findings of this study are: hot electrons and holes are created through the quantum optical transitions near the surfaces; particles with small size can produce highly excited electrons (essential for photocatalysis via sequential mechanism) in large amounts; hot electron generation requires two major components (intensification of the magnitude of electric field in the hot spot and breaking of linear momentum of electron in the hot spot); and chemical interface damping could facilitate the establishment of productive plasmon-enhanced molecular photocatalysis reactions. Commonly, Ag, Au and Cu are used as dopants to induce the SPR effect. It is probably organized through two mechanisms, direct electron transfer (DET) and resonance energy transfer (RET) from metal to TiO2 [200]. If the photocatalyst is a physical mixture or the metal and TiO2 are not in direct contact with each other, RET mechanism occurs. DET mechanism takes place when the metal and TiO2 are in direct contact with each other. For example, the life-time of plasmon excited electrons on Au can be extended up to 1.5 ns via DET from Au to TiO2 when Au and TiO2 are in direct contact with each other [201]. Upon visible light irradiation, the electrons are photo-excited in Au or Ag via SPR absorption. The energetic electrons are then easily migrated from Au to TiO2. The electron transfer process from TiO2 to metal, or metal to TiO2, relies on the nature of light irradiation source. For example, the following electron transfer mechanisms are possible for Au-TiO2 under different light sources: TiO2 to Au (UV light); Au to TiO2 (visible light); Both, TiO2 to Au and Au to TiO2 (UV–vis light) [177]. To validate this, the H2 production efficiency of mesoporous Au-TiO2 was evaluated under visible/UV–vis light irradiation [201]. The photocatalyst was synthesized in the presence of a co-polymer to induce crystal defects or impurities in TiO2. The proposed photocatalytic mechanism of mesoporous Au-TiO2 is shown in Fig. 14 (a). The results revealed that the H2 production efficiency of Pt-TiO2 (300.63 μmol h−1 g−1) was much higher than Au-TiO2 (57.02 μmol h−1 g−1) under UV–vis light irradiation. The high efficiency of Pt-TiO2 is ascribed to the low over-potential and high work function of Pt as compared to Au. TiO2 can be easily excited by UV light and the photo-excited electrons are migrated from the CB to Pt or Au. Therefore, the charge carrier separation process and H2 production rate are enhanced on the catalyst surface. Nevertheless, the efficiencies of Au-TiO2 (7 μmol h−1 g−1) and Pt-TiO2 (2.3 μmol h−1 g−1) were reversed under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) (Fig. 14 (b)). The efficiency of Au-TiO2 is nearly three times higher than that of Pt-TiO2. This might be attributed to the following reasons: enrichment of visible light excitation of TiO2 by the strong localized electric field via the plasmon excitation of Au; the transfer of more energetic electrons from the plasmon-excited Au to TiO2 [202]. In another study, it was found that the H2 yield of Ag-TiO2 (8.1 μmol cm–2) under UV–vis light irradiation was higher than the sum of H2 yield of Ag-TiO2 (5.8 μmol cm–2) under separate UV (4.2 μmol cm–2) and visible light (3.9 μmol cm–2) irradiation [203]. H2 yield of Ag-TiO2 under UV light irradiation was almost doubled when the visible light was added. The enhancement in efficiency is attributed to the synergistic effect of Schottky barrier formation and SPR. Upon UV light irradiation, a Schottky barrier is formed between Ag and TiO2 to promote the migration of photo-excited electrons from TiO2 and Ag. Concurrently, SPR effect is introduced by the visible light, indicating the photo-excitation of electrons in Ag. A strong local electric field is also formed to enhance the energy of trapped electrons, suggesting the electron transfer and photo-reduction process (H+ to H2) occurs more easily. Most of the previous studies suggest the importance of Cu reduced states for the photocatalytic activity. Recently, MuÇoz-Batista et al. [38] studied the phase-contact engineering in mono and bimetallic non-noble metal co-catalysts (Cu-Ni) for photocatalytic H2 production using TiO2. They examined the variations in oxidation state, size and structure of the photocatalyst under operando conditions (measurements under working conditions). The new perspectives (light-matter interaction) of mono and bimetallic photocatalysts were unveiled by a combination of micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies at appropriate X-ray beam/light probe length (Fig. 15 ). The results testified that Cu showed a high response as compared Ni in the bimetallic photocatalyst under operando conditions. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity was facilitated by a core shell structure of Cu (Cu0 in the core and CuII in the outer surface (Fig. 15)).The electron handling property was enabled by Cu0 and the surface chemical role was facilitated by the oxidized Cu phase. The photocatalytic efficiency was further improved by the secondary chemical role of Ni in the bimetallic catalysts. XANES and EXAFS studies revealed that Cu0 is finely dispersed in the copper oxide matrix. Ni played a key role to shape the phase contact between the Cu rich phases and to govern the electronic or structural properties of Cu phases. Like noble metals, transition metal nitrides (TMN’s) such as titanium nitride and zirconium nitride nanomaterials have also been recently used as plasmonic materials for photocatalytic applications [204,205]. The optical properties of TMN are almost similar to that of noble metals. The plasmon resonance, stability (chemical and thermal), durability, and corrosion resistance of TMN are higher than that of noble metals [206–208]. TMN nanomaterials can inject more hot electrons into the CB of TiO2 as compared to Au nanoparticles. The cost of TMN are significantly cheaper when compared to Au or Pt nanoparticles. Naldoni et al. [204] reported the broadband hot-electron collection for solar water splitting using plasmonic TiN. The photocurrent response of TiO2/titanium nitride system is higher than that of TiO2/Au system for water splitting. This is ascribed to the following reasons: titanium nitride nanoparticles offer a broadband absorption over the wavelength range 500 nm–1200 nm and titanium nitride creates an Ohmic junction with TiO2 to facilitate the electron collection. This kind of Ohmic junction is beneficial for high conversion efficiencies through “downhill” hot electron collection into TiO2."
4,Incorporation of new energy levels,"2.3 Incorporation of new energy levels The charge carrier recombination process is suppressed by the metal dopants via introducing new energy levels in TiO2. Doping of metal cations can generate donor (above the VB of TiO2) or acceptor (below the CB of TiO2) energy levels (Fig. 16 ) levels [209]. Cation doping also influences the crystallinity and creates crystal defects in TiO2. Non-metal or anion doping (e.g. I, N, C, F) is commonly employed to increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under visible light [102,210–213]. It is predicted that non-metal doping is more beneficial than metal doping, because it will avoid the formation of charge carrier recombination centers when compared to cation doping [209]. In most of the recent studies, N was used as a non-metal dopant to improve the water splitting efficiency of TiO2 [145,214–216]. The bandgap energy of TiO2 is narrowed through the generation of gap states by the interaction of N 2p and O 2p states [217]. The mixing up of orbitals uplifts the VB level of TiO2 while the CB remains unaffected (Fig. 17 ). Consequently, the photo-reduction ability of TiO2 is unchanged; however, its oxidation capability is decreased. Co-doping (metal/metal [40,218] or metal/non-metal [97,219]) of TiO2 with two metals is also a promising way to narrow the bandgap energy, suppress the charge carrier recombination and maintain the charge balance. The photocatalytic mechanism of metal doped TiO2 from some of the recent research studies are highlighted briefly in the following section. We also identified that most of the recent water splitting studies have been performed with bimetallic dopants. The impact of Cu oxidation species on the H2 production efficiency of TiO2 was evaluated under UV–vis light irradiation [220]. It was found that the proportion of Cu/Cu2O/CuO species was mainly influenced by the differences in calcination temperature, time and atmosphere during synthesis. Cu/TiO2 was synthesized by impregnation method. The synthesized samples were initially dried at 110 °C overnight. Then, the dried samples were calcined separately in air and hydrogen atmospheres. The samples were further calcined at 300 °C for 0.5 h. Hydrogen treated samples were synthesized by the further calcination of the air treated samples using 10% of H2 in Ar atmosphere at 300 °C for 1 h, 2 h and 3 h. The colour of Cu/TiO2 samples was identified as dark grey and indigo for air and hydrogen treated samples respectively. XPS results (Fig. 18 (g) and (h)) revealed that Cu mainly existed in the form of CuO (Cu2+ state) with some Cu2O (Cu+ state) for air calcined samples, while it presented as a stable metallic copper (Cu° state) for the hydrogen treated samples. H2 production rate of hydrogen-treated Cu-TiO2 was 2.4 times faster than that of air calcined sample. DFT calculations of TiO2 anatase (101) slab with CuO, Cu2O and Cu° is show in Fig. 18 (a–e). The results testified that the reduction of Cu2+ or Cu+ is thermodynamically more favorable when compared to H+ (Fig. 19 (a)) reduction. Based on the experimental and DFT results, two different charge transfer mechanisms were proposed for the photocatalytic activity of CuO/TiO2 (Fig. 19 (b)) and Cu°/TiO2 samples (Fig. 19 (c)). For CuO/TiO2 samples, H2 is produced through the following steps: (i) At first, CuO is reduced to Cu2O using photo-generated electrons. This is further supported by an initial lag in H2 production efficiency from the reaction mixture. The samples were also analysed by XPS after the photo-reaction to confirm the oxidation states. The further reduction of Cu2O to Cu0 is considerably restricted by the band alignment of Cu2O and TiO2 (ii) Cu2O itself could act as a semiconductor and therefore electron-hole pairs are produced on both TiO2 and Cu2O (iii) Because of the band alignment, the electrons are quickly migrated from the CB of Cu2O into that of TiO2 [221,222]; (iv) H2 is produced by the electrons accumulated on the TiO2 surface. For hydrogen treated samples, Cu0 acts as a co-catalyst like Pt [223]. DFT results revealed that a continuum of Cu0 states is formed within the TiO2 bandgap. The photo-generated electrons from TiO2 were easily attracted and collected on the surface of Cu0 to reduce H+. Visible light-driven photocatalytic activity was also evaluated for CuO/TiO2, Cu2O/TiO2 (CuO/TiO2 after 0.5 h of UV light treatment) and Cu0/TiO2 samples. There was no H2 production from CuO/TiO2, indicating the photo-generated electrons from TiO2 are essential to reduce Cu2+ and display the photocatalytic activity. However, remarkable H2 production efficiencies are exhibited by Cu2O/TiO2 and Cu0/TiO2 after prolonged irradiation. The efficiency of Cu2O/TiO2 is ascribed to the band alignment of Cu2O and TiO2 for the effective charge separation. The efficiency of Cu0/TiO2 is attributed to SPR effect of Cu0 [224]. In a similar study [225], H2 production efficiency of bimetallic Cu-Pt TiO2 was evaluated in glycerol –water mixture under UV–vis light irradiation. H2 production rates were found to be in the following order: Cu-Pt/TiO2 > Pt/TiO2 > Cu-TiO2 > neat TiO2. Experimental and DFT calculations revealed that the photo-reduction of CuOx–PtO2 into metallic Cu and Pt deposits is thermodynamically more favorable when compared to H+ reduction. The schematic representation of charge transfer process in Cu-Pt/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 20 . H2 is produced by the following three steps: (i) at first CuOx and PtO2 are initially reduced into Cu0 and Pt0, respectively by the photo-generated electrons. (ii) Electrons are then easily migrated from the CB of TiO2 to the bimetallic surface (Cu-Pt). The suppression of electron-hole recombination is testified by the PL measurements of the photo-irradiated samples (Fig. 20 (d)) (iii) H+ is reduced into H2 on the Cu-Pt surface. The superior efficiency of Cu-Pt/TiO2 is ascribed to high electron density on the bimetallic particles (by the interaction of Cu and Pt) when compared to the single metal (Cu or Pt) doped TiO2. This was further evidenced by XPS, PL, Mulliken charges and DFT calculations. Clarizia et al. [226] also suggested that Cu° could absorb visible light and enhance the H2 production efficiency of TiO2 through SPR effect. H2 production experiments were carried out by in situ photo-deposited Cu°/TiO2 under UV–vis light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated in the presence of different sacrificial agents such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, formic acid, glycerol, glucose, isopropyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol. Among them, glycerol showed the best performance. The plausible mechanism of electron-hole separation in Cu0/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 21 (a). During light irradiation, Cu2+ and Cu+ were reduced first into metallic copper (Cu0). This was further confirmed by XRD analysis of the Cu/TiO2 after the photocatalysis reaction (Fig. 21 (b)). It was stated that both Cu0 and TiO2 are easily photo-excited under UV–vis light irradiation. The photo-excited electrons from Cu0 are quickly injected into the CB of TiO2, leading to H2 formation with H+. Hence, the photo-generated charge carriers are highly separated on the catalyst surface. Pérez-Larios et al. [227] evaluated the synergistic effect of Mn oxidation states on the H2 production efficiency of TiO2 using methanol-water system and UV light irradiation. It was found that the H2 efficiency of 5 wt% Mn-TiO2 (1736 μmol h−1 g−1) was ∼6.5 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (264 μmol h−1 g−1). This is attributed to the high charge separation efficiency of Mn dopant with various oxidation states. The ionic radius of Ti4+, Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ are 0.68 Ǻ, 0.80 Ǻ, 0.66 Ǻ and 0.60, respectively [228]. Therefore, Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions are interstitially incorporated into TiO2. The proposed charge separation mechanism of Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ doped TiO2 is shown in Figs. 22 and 23 . Mn dopant could act as an electron trap in the Mn4+/Mn3+ oxidation state or a hole trap in Mn2+/Mn3+ oxidation state. The electron trap mechanism of Mn4+/Mn3+ can be explained as follows (Fig. 22): The photo-excitation of methanol (sacrificial agent) under UV light irradiation [229,230] promotes an electron transfer from methanol to Mn4+ or Mn3+ on the catalyst surface. Hence, Mn4+ or Mn3+ ions are momentarily oxidized into Mn3+ or Mn2+ ions. The photo-generated holes from TiO2 can induce the recovery of Mn4+ or Mn3+ ions via oxidation reaction with Mn3+ or Mn2+ [231,232]. These reactions will avoid the charge carrier recombination process and the photo-generated electrons are easily accumulated on the catalyst surface to increase H2 production. The electron trap mechanism of Mn3+/Mn2+ can be explained as follows (Fig. 23): It was believed that oxidation state of Mn3+/Mn2+ ions into the TiO2 lattice are momentarily changed into Mn4+/Mn3+ through the reaction with photo-generated holes. In the meantime, the electrons from photo-excited methanol can induce the recovery of Mn3+/Mn2+ ions [233,234]. Therefore, the photo-generated electrons are quickly migrated to the catalyst surface to enhance H2 formation. The photocatalytic activity of 3D ordered macro-porous (3DOM) Fe3+ doped TiO2 was studied under visible light irradiation [235]. The photocatalyst was synthesized using PMMA as a template. It should be noted that the ionic radius of Fe3+ (0.64 Ǻ) and Ti4+ (0.68 Ǻ) are almost identical. Therefore, some of the Ti4+ ions in the crystal lattice of TiO2 can be easily substituted by Fe3+ ions during calcination [236,237]. They also found that the photocatalytic activity of 3DOM Fe3+ doped TiO2 was higher than that of Fe3+ doped TiO2 (Fig. 24 (a)). This is attributed to the readiness of additional optical absorption active sites for photon trapping and bandgap narrowing. The closely packed 3D morphology (Fig. 24 (b)) enhances the visible light absorption by extending the path length of light. Also, the high active surface area of 3D network can provide more interfacial active sites to simplify the mass transfer. The electron-hole separation process is promoted by the creation of an impurity level below the CB of TiO2 via Fe3+/2+ doping (Fig. 24 (c)). It is believed that Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions located below the CB of TiO2 can act as photo-generated electron acceptor (e− + Fe3+ → Fe2+) and electron donor (Fe2+ ↔ Fe3+ + e−), respectively to promote the electron-hole separation process. Fe2+ ions are typically not stable, and they obviously release free electrons to yield Fe3+ (Eq. (1)–(3), Fig. 24 (c)). The excess electrons can directly migrate into the CB of TiO2. Therefore, the H2 production efficiency is enhanced through the availability of more electrons and the superior electron hole separation process. Recently, Patra et al. [200] studied the H2 production efficiency of plasmonic Ag-Au bimetallic TiO2 photocatalyst. Au and Ag were utilized to expand the visible light absorption through plasmonic nano-antenna (SPR effect). Moreover, both Au and Ag have similar lattice constants (2.3 Ǻ for the Ag (111) facet and 2.4 Ǻ for the Au (111) facet) [238]. Because of this identical lattice constant, they can easily interact with each other to form bimetallic nano-composites. HRTEM (Fig. 25 (A)) and PL (Fig. 25 (B)) results revealed that the Au-Ag and TiO2 are in direct contact with each other, supporting the direct electron transfer (DET) mechanism from metal to TiO2. Ag is deposited on the surface of Au, indicating core shell morphology. Au (111) facet is determined as 0.24 nm at the center of the nanoparticle while Ag (111) facet is calculated as 0.23 nm at the edges. The low PL intensity of Ag-Au/TiO2 is ascribed to high charge carrier separation on the photocatalyst surface through the Schottky junction. The detailed photocatalysis mechanism is shown in Fig. 25 (C). The plasmonic metal nanoparticles are excited to its SPR state during visible light irradiation. DET occurs from the metal SPR state to the CB of TiO2, when the energy level of CB is lower than that of metal SPR state. Moreover, the electron transfer process of Ag-Au-TiO2 is higher as compared to Au-TiO2 or Ag-TiO2. The photo-reduction and oxidation reactions occurred at the CB of TiO2 and Au-Ag surfaces, respectively. In another study, the synergistic effect of SPR and Schottky barrier was examined using Ag-Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst in water-ethylene glycol mixture [239]. It was found that Ag doping did not induce any colour change, however the catalysts were grey in colour after adding Pd. The electron-hole transfer process in Ag-Pd/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 26 . An increase in the electric field and electron injection into the TiO2 are achieved via the partial overlap of SPR (Ag) with the bandgap of TiO2. It was expected that the bimetallic nanoparticles could improve the efficiency through DET [240], RET [241] and field effect [242,243]. Among the different bimetallic compositions, only two catalysts (0.6Ag-0.4Pd/TiO2 and 0.2Ag-0.8Pd/TiO2) showed high efficiency. The results indicated that a balance between SPR effect (due to Ag) and Schottky barrier mechanism (due to Pd) are required to achieve maximum efficiency. Similarly, the synergistic effect of Ni and Au nanoparticles on the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 was evaluated [244]. The H2 production efficiency of x-Ni/TiO2, x-Au/TiO2 and x-Ni-Au/TiO2 were 31 μmol h–1, 58 μmol h–1 and 157 μmol h–1, respectively. The efficiency of x-Ni/TiO2 is increased five times in the presence of a small quantity of Au (the atomic ratio of Au: Ni was 1:5 in Ni-Au/TiO2). This is attributed to the electronic and geometric effects of both dopants. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the photocatalysts is in the following order: Ni-Au-TiO2 > Ni/TiO2 > Au/TiO2 > TiO2 (Fig. 27 (a)). The high AQE of Ni-Au/TiO2 is attributed to the low charge carrier recombination (time resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) signal) rate. A proposed photocatalytic mechanism is shown in Fig. 27 (b) and (c). Ni is distributed in the form of NiO clusters and metallic nickel (Ni (0)). An ohmic junction is formed by Ni(0) between the interphase of TiO2 and NiO. TRMC results suggested that both NiO and TiO2 are photo-excited simultaneously under UV-light irradiation. A small amount of photo-generated electron from the CB of TiO2 is recombined with the holes in the VB of NiO via the ohmic junction. Nevertheless, TRMC results revealed that the availability of photo-generated electrons in TiO2 and Ni-TiO2 is identical. Therefore, the ohmic contact is beneficial to avoid the photo-generated electron-hole recombination. Finally, H2 is formed on the surfaces of Au and NiO via H recombination. The bimetallic nanoparticles acted as superior H bonding sites when compared to monometallic nanoparticles. Metal (Sn) and non-metal (N) dopants were utilized to substantially raise the visible light absorption and charge separation efficiency of TiO2 [245]. UV-DRS results (Fig. 28 (i)) affirmed that the absorption edge of TiO2 is completely extended into the visible region after doping with Sn and N. This is attributed to the construction of O2p–N2p and O2p–Sn5s energy states (i.e. new VB edge) near the VB edge of TiO2 (Fig. 28(iii)). XPS results also indicated that the electronic structure of TiO2 is altered significantly via TiOSn and TiON linkages [246,247] (Fig. 28(ii)). The mobility, transfer and consumption ratio of photo-generated charge carriers are greatly improved by the incorporation of new energy levels. The H2 production efficiency of Sn-N-TiO2 (2.81 μ mol h−1 g−1) was higher than the sum of N-TiO2 and Sn-TiO2 efficiencies under simulated solar light (i.e. UV–vis light) irradiation. In another study [248], the effect of Mg doping on the inter-band defect states (formed by oxygen vacancies) of anatase TiO2 was examined under UV light irradiation. The photocatalytic experiments were carried out in the presence of Pt as co-catalyst and methanol as sacrificial agent. For photocatalysis, the defects play a major role in the formation of charge carrier recombination centers. Two different kinds of defects, shallow (below the CB minimum) and deep (above the VB maximum) defect states, were identified for TiO2 (Fig. 29 (i)) by the transient IR absorption excitation energy scanning spectroscopy (TIRAEESS). The results revealed that the shallow defect states are minimized, and the deep defect states are eliminated by Mg doping (0.5%) (Fig. 29 (ii)). The photocatalytic efficiency of Mg/TiO2 was also compared with Ni/TiO2 and Cr/TiO2 to evaluate the role of d-orbital. Mg/TiO2 displayed the highest H2 production efficiency and there was no H2 production using transition metal doped TiO2. This is attributed to the formation of new defect states in the bandgap of TiO2 by the d orbital of Ni or Cr. The ionic radii of Mg2+ (65 pm) and Ti4+ (68 pm) are almost identical. The calculated total density of states (DOS) of pure TiO2, Mg-TiO2 and Ni-TiO2 is shown in Fig. 29 (iii). The results clearly showed that there are no defects introduced by Mg doping (Mg do not have d orbital) in the bandgap of TiO2. Moreover, the intrinsic defects of TiO2 are quenched by Mg doping. Because, the Mg 2p orbit is far away from the CB and VB of TiO2. However, new defect states are created in TiO2 and the intrinsic defects are strengthened by the Ni dopant (due to the interaction of d orbital of with oxygen vacancies)."
5,Kinetics of H2 production using metal doped TiO2,"Published reports on the kinetics of H2 production rate using metal-doped TiO2 are limited. Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) was the model used by most of the researchers to express the rate of H2 production with respect to sacrificial agent concentration or photocatalyst loading [249–253]. In a recent study, Clarizia et al. [250] investigated the kinetic model for H2 generation on Cu/TiO2 via photo-reforming of methanol and glycerol. The mass balance equations of the main reactive species were considered to develop the kinetic model. The model was verified to establish the H2 production rates for experiments with various concentrations of methanol and glycerol. Five important photocatalytic steps were considered to develop the kinetic model for H2 generation: Step-1: Light absorption and charge-carrier generation (21) C u ( s ) / T i O 2 → h v e − + h + (22) R a t e o f t h e r e a c t i o n : G = ɸ U V V · Q a , U V + ɸ V I S V · Q a , V I S The rate of the charge carrier reaction is mainly governed by the quantum yield (ɸ) and average volumetric rate of photon absorption (Qa). The total volume of photo-irradiated solution is expressed as V. Step-2: Charge carrier recombination (23) e − + h + → k r H e a t a n d l i g h t (24) R a t e o f the r e a c t i o n : k r · [ h + ] · [ e − ] The charge carrier recombination reaction is ruled by the second order kinetics and kr is the electron-hole recombination constant [251]. Step-3: Adsorption of sacrificial agent on the catalyst surface (25) S + ∴ * → ⟵ S * (26) [ S * ] = C T K a d s [ S ] 1 + K a d s [ S ] [S*] is the concentration of adsorbed sacrificial agent, [S] is the concentration of sacrificial agent and CT is total concentration of active sites on the photocatalyst surface. Step-4: Reaction of sacrificial agent with holes (27) S * + h + → k h + S • * + H + (28) R a t e o f the r e a c t i o n : k h + · [ h + ] · [ S * ] (29) S • * + H + → H • / f a s t ∴ * + S o x + 2 H + The direct (or) indirect reaction of sacrificial agents is ruled by its adsorption behaviour on the photocatalyst surface [4]. Step-5: Photo-reduction of H+ with e (30) H + + e − → f a s t H • → H • / f a s t H 2 These five chemical reactions were used to develop the mathematical model (31) d [ S ] d t = − k h + · [ h + ] · [ S * ] (32) d [ h + ] d t = G − k r · [ h + ] · [ e − ] − 2 k h + · [ h + ] · [ S * ] (33) d [ e − ] d t = G − k r · [ h + ] · [ e − ] − 2 k h + · [ h + ] · [ S * ] (34) d [ H 2 ] d t = k h + · [ h + ] · [ S * ] (35) G = G U V + G V I S GUV and GVIS values were calculated from the irradiance of the lamp and extinction co-efficient of photocatalyst under UV and visible light. The possibility of using this kinetic model is a result of the availability of parameters such as ɸUV, ɸVIS, kr, kh+ and Kads. Among these parameters, Kads was directly determined from the experiments using LH model. Kads values were calculated from the plot of 1/rH2 vs 1/[S] (Fig. 30 ). (36) r H 2 = k ′ K a d s [ S ] 1 + K a d s [ S ] The results showed that the electron hole recombination rate (kr) of Cu/TiO2 is four times lower than that of TiO2 P25, confirming the suppression of electron-hole recombination through Cu doping. The quantum efficiency of Cu/TiO2 is higher than that of TiO2 P25, suggesting the effective utilization of adsorbed energy. Moreover, the equilibrium adsorption constant of glycerol is higher than that of methanol. CT of TiO2 is not significantly affected by Cu doping. In another study, the rate of H2 production rate of Au/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 was explained using LH model [252] (Fig. 31 ). The effect of initial glucose concentration (sacrificial agent) was studied on the H2 production rate using Au/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 under visible light irradiation. The rate of the reaction can be expressed as: (37) R a t e = k K [ s a c r i f i c a l a g e n t ] 1 + K [ s a c r i f i c i a l a g e n t ] Where K is the adsorption coefficient of sacrificial agent on the photocatalyst surface and k is the pseudo first order rate constant. It was found that the rate of H2 production is constant (Rate ≈ k ; K[glucose] >> 1) at high glucose concentration, indicating zero order kinetics. At low glucose concentration, the rate of H2 production is directly proportional to the concentration of glucose (Rate ≈ k K[glucose]; K[glucose] << 1), resulting in first order kinetics. In a similar study [254], the effect of Cu and Cu-Pt nanoparticles on the H2 production rate of TiO2 was investigated using methanol (20 vol %) photo-steam reforming. It was found that the H2 production rate was constant and the reaction followed pseudo zero order kinetics. The reaction intermediates and kinetics for the vapour-phase photocatalytic methanol reforming was studied using noble metal (Au) modified TiO2 [255]. The oxidation path of methanol photo-reforming proceeds through the following ways: (i) indirect OH –mediated route (ii) direct h VB + -mediated route (iii) water assisted direct way. The proposed mechanisms were evidenced by H2O/D2O isotopic exchange experiments. In this reaction, methanol and water can act as electron donor (ED) species whereas the proton acts as electron acceptor (EA) species. The important steps after the generation of electron-hole pairs are the following: (i) Adsorption of ED and EA species on the cathodic and anodic active sites of the photocatalyst (38) E A g ⇆ E A a d s (39) E D g ⇆ E D a d s (ii) The reaction of photo-generated electrons and holes with EA and ED at the catalyst surface (40) E A a d s + e C B - → P 1 , a d s (41) E D a d s + h V B + → P 2 , a d s Release of heat (Q) from the electron-hole recombination process (42) e C B - + h V B + → k r e c o m b T i O 2 + Q (iii) Desorption of products from the photocatalyst surface (43) P 1 , a d s ⇆ P 1 , g a n d P 2 , a d s ⇆ P 2 , g The reactions involved in the photocatalytic vapour phase oxidation of methanol under steady state conditions is schematically shown in Fig. 32 . The intermediates and products generated from the stepwise oxidation of surface adsorbed water and methanol are given as follows: (44) H 2 O g ⇆ k w k - w H 2 O a d s (45) C H 3 O H g ⇆ k m k - m C H 3 O H a d s (46) H 2 O a d s + h V B + → k 1 • O H a d s + H a d s + (47) C H 3 O H a d s + • O H a d s o r h V B + → k 2 C H 3 O a d s • + H 2 O ( o r H a d s + ) (48) C H 3 O a d s • + • O H a d s o r h V B + → k 2 ' H 2 C O a d s + H 2 O ( o r H a d s + ) (49) H 2 C O a d s → k d e s , H 2 C O H 2 C O g (50) H 2 C O a d s + • O H a d s o r h V B + → k 3 H C O a d s • + H 2 O ( o r H a d s + ) (51) H C O a d s • + • O H a d s → k 3 ' H C O O H a d s (52) H C O O H a d s → k d e s , H C O O H H C O O H g (53) H C O O H a d s + • O H a d s o r h V B + → k 4 • C O O H a d s + H 2 O ( o r H a d s + ) (54) • C O O H a d s + • O H a d s o r h V B + → k 4 ' C O 2 , a d s + H 2 O ( o r H a d s + ) (55) C O 2 , a d s → k d e s , C O 2 C O 2 , g (56) 2 H a d s + + 2 e C B - → k r e d H 2 Methanol (CH3OH) is oxidized into carbon dioxide (CO2) via formaldehyde (H2CO) and formic acid (HCOOH) intermediates. Each oxidation step may progress through the direct reaction of surface adsorbed species with holes (h VB +) or indirect reaction with hydroxyl radicals (•OH). The concentration of the adsorbed species on the photocatalyst surface is constant under steady state conditions. The kinetic rate expression for the products or intermediates are given as follows: (57) d [ C H 3 O a d s • ] d t = r 2 - r 2 ' = 0 (58) d [ H 2 C O a d s ] d t = r 2 ' - r 3 - r d e s , H 2 C O = 0 (59) d [ C H O a d s • ] d t = r 3 - r 3 ' = 0 (60) d [ H C O O H a d s ] d t = r 3 ' - r 4 - r d e s , H C O O H = 0 (61) d [ H C O O a d s • ] d t = r 4 - r 4 ' = 0 (62) d [ C O 2 , a d s ] d t = r 4 ' - r d e s , C O 2 = 0 The overall rate of CH3OH conversion is equal to the sum of the rates of H2CO, HCOOH and CO2 formation. (63) r d e s , H 2 C O + r d e s , H C O O H + r d e s , C O 2 = r 2 The rates of H2CO, HCOOH, and CO2 production are equal to: (64) r d e s , H 2 C O = r 2 ' - r 3 = r 2 - r 3 (65) r d e s , H C O O H = r 3 ' - r 4 = r 3 - r 4 (66) r d e s , C O 2 = r 4 ' = r 4 Based on the proposed scheme, the rate of each oxidation step is the sum of the rates of direct and indirect reactions by h VB + and •OH, respectively. (67) r 2 = k 2 O H θ O H θ C H 3 O H + k 2 h [ h V B + ] θ C H 3 O H Where k OH 2 and k h 2 are the rate constants of the •OH -mediated and h VB + -mediated reactions, respectively. The surface concentration of holes is denoted as [h VB +]. θ is the fraction of surface active sites enclosed by the respective adsorbed intermediate species. k OH 2 and k h 2 can be calculated from the sum of rate constants of the three products such as H2CO, HCOOH and CO2 formation. (68) k 2 O H = k H 2 C O O H + k H C O O H O H + k C O 2 O H = ∑ k i O H (69) k 2 h = k H 2 C O h + k H C O O H h + k C O 2 h = ∑ k i h θOH and [h VB +] under steady state conditions can be calculated as follows: (70) d [ O H a d s ] d t = k 1 h V B + θ H 2 O - θ O H k 2 O H θ C H 3 O H + ∑ k j O H θ i = 0 (71) θ O H = k 1 h V B + θ H 2 O k 2 O H θ C H 3 O H + ∑ k j O H θ i [h VB +] depends on the light irradiation conditions (Ia ) and the photocatalyst intrinsic properties (krecomb and Φ). (72) d [ h V B + ] d t = I a ϕ - k r e c o m b h V B + e C B - - h V B + ( k 1 θ H 2 O + ∑ k j h θ i ) = 0 The charge recombination process in TiO2 is much faster than the electron/hole transfer process. (73) I a ϕ ≅ k r e c o m b h V B + [ e C B - ] Under steady state conditions photogenerated electrons are equals to that of holes ([hVB + ] ≈ [eCB − ]). Therefore, (74) h V B + = I a ϕ k r e c o m b By substituting the values of [hVB + ] and θOH (75) r i = I a ϕ k r e c o m b k i O H k 1 θ H 2 O θ C H 3 O H k 2 O H θ C H 3 O H + ∑ k j O H θ i + k i h θ C H 3 O H According to the Langmuir model: θi = Kipi / (1+Ʃ iKipi ). Ki and pi are the adsorption equilibrium constant and partial pressure of the “ith” product under light irradiation. (76) r i = k i ' O H K H 2 O p H 2 O K C H 3 O H p C H 3 O H k 2 O H K C H 3 O H p C H 3 O H + ∑ k j O H K i p i 1 + K H 2 O p H 2 O + K C H 3 O H p C H 3 O H + ∑ K i p i + k i ' h K C H 3 O H p C H 3 O H 1 + K H 2 O p H 2 O + K C H 3 O H p C H 3 O H + ∑ K i p i Where ki ′OH and ki ′h are the constants. K H 2 O and K C H 3 O H are the adsorption equilibrium constants of H2O, CH3OH on the photocatalyst surface. “i” is the intermediate species. p H 2 O and p C H 3 O H (partial pressures of H2O and CH3OH) values are negligible with respect to their vapour pressure. Thus, Ʃk jKipi and ƩKipi term can be neglected. According to the non-ideal behaviour of liquids (77) p H 2 O = γ H 2 O 1 - x p H 2 O ° , x (78) p C H 3 O H = γ C H 3 O H x p C H 3 O H ° Where po is the vapour pressure and x is the mole fraction of the liquid. The equation for ri can be modified by substituting the activity coefficients (γ) of H2O and CH3OH. (79) r i = k i ' O H γ H 2 O A ( 1 - x ) 1 + γ H 2 O A + x ( γ C H 3 O H B - γ H 2 O A ) + k i ' h × γ C H 3 O H B x 1 + γ H 2 O A + x ( γ C H 3 O H B - γ H 2 O A ) Where (80) A = K H 2 O p H 2 O ° , B = K C H 3 O H p C H 3 O H ° , k i ' O H = k i O H k 1 k 2 I a ϕ k r e c o m b (81) k i ' h = k i h I a ϕ k r e c o m b The rate of the reaction is equal to zero (0) when x becomes 0 (i.e. pCH3OH = 0). The contribution of OH –mediated reaction quickly increases with increasing of x until it reaches a maximum and then decreases. The contribution is faster when B is higher than A. The contribution of h+ VB–mediated reaction increases with increasing of x and it reaches the maximum value when x = 1 (B/(1+B)). Nevertheless, H2CO was detected as the only product as the reactant was pure CH3OH. The overall formation rate of HCOOH and CO2 was decreased to 0 when x = 1. Therefore, k h HCOOH and k h CO2 are 0. k h 2 = k h H2CO. Besides as the source of •OH, water can act as a reactant to provide an oxygen atom during the oxidation of H2CO to HCOOH. Another significant role of water is a diffusion medium for protons (H+) formed during each oxidation step at the photocatalyst surface towards the noble metal. Reaction sites situated at the TiO2-noble metal interface (site 1) are different from that of TiO2 surface far from the noble metal (site 2). CH3OH adsorbed on site 1 can directly transfer H+ to the noble metal during the oxidation reaction to H2CO via reaction with h+ VB. CH3OH adsorbed on site 2 can transfer H+ to the noble metal through the water assisted path, suggesting the transfer H+ with the help of nearest OH. Consequently, the rate-determining step of any h+ VB – mediated oxidation reaction on the TiO2 surface sites far from the noble metals is envisaged to involve with H2O molecules. The kinetics of water assisted path (ri,wa ) relies on the concentration of H2O and CH3OH adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. (82) r i , w a = k i , w a h V B + θ C H 3 O H θ H 2 O The equation for a bell shaped curve as a function of x (ri,wa = 0 when x = 1 or x = 0 and a maximum) can be written as follows: (83) r i , w a = k i , w a ' γ H 2 O A γ C H 3 O H B x ( 1 - x ) [ 1 + γ H 2 O A + x ( γ C H 3 O H B - γ H 2 O A ) ] 2 (84) k i , w a ' = k i , w a I a ϕ k r e c o m b In a recent study, Escobedo et al. [193] established a kinetic model for the photocatalytic H2 production using Pt/TiO2 and ethanol (as a sacrificial agent) in a photo-reactor with H2 collection tank (Photo-CREC water II Reactor). The experiments were carried out with acidic pH, near UV irradiation and optimum Pt/TiO2 loading. An “In series parallel” kinetic model was used to describe the conversion of ethanol during photocatalytic H2 production. LH equation for the photocatalytic conversion of ethanol is given by: (85) r i = L V R P A f H + k i I K i A C i 1 + ∑ j = 1 n K j A C j = k i * K i A C i 1 + ∑ j = 1 n K j A C j Here, the local volumetric rate of photon absorption is denoted as LVRPA (it can be experimentally measured via the irradiation light intensity macroscopic balance inside the photo-reactor), the effect of pH on photocatalytic reaction is described as f[H +], the adsorption constant (L/mol) is represented as Ki A , the apparent reaction kinetic constant (mol/gcath) is represented as ki *, and the concentration of chemical species (mol/L) is indicated as Ci . The rate of electron-hole generation highly relies on the LVRPA. Moreover, LVRPA could be used to determine the optimum photocatalyst loading required for a photo-reactor. The average local volumetric rate of photon absorption (ea ) can be calculated by the radiative transfer equation (RTE) [36,37,40,256–258].

(87) σ λ = β λ * ω λ (88) κ λ = β λ - σ λ The scattering phase for TiO2 based photocatalysts can be determined by the Henyey and Greenstein phase function [256,258]. (89) p Ω _ ' → Ω _ = 1 - g λ 2 ( 1 + g λ 2 - 2 g λ u 0 ) 3 / 2 Here, g2 λ is the asymmetry factor and u0 is the director cosine between incoming and outgoing radiation at each point of the space. RTE can be solved with the help of discrete ordinate method (MOD) in a rectangular spectrophotometer cell (the detailed calculations are given in the original literature [36,37,40]). ea could be calculated after measuring the optical properties of the photocatalyst as follows: (90) e a = ∫ λ κ λ • ∫ Ω = 4 π I λ , Ω _ ( x _ ) d Ω d λ The Photo-CREC water II Reactor was operated in the batch mode. Accordingly, the rate of the reaction can be written as follows: (91) r i = 1 W i r r , c a t d N i d t = V W i r r , c a t d N i V d t = V W i r r , c a t d C i d t where Wirr,cat describes the weight of irradiated photocatalyst in grams, V denotes the total volume of reactor in litres, Ni represents the moles of “i” species and t indicates the irradiation time in minutes. (92) r i = d C i d t = W i r r V k i * K i A C i 1 + ∑ j = 1 n K j A C j The above can be expressed further using an apparent rate constant (93) k i = W i r r V k i * K i A (94) d C i d t = k i C i 1 + ∑ j = 1 n K j A C j Langmuir adsorption isotherm for the chemisorption of chemical species/intermediates can be described as follows: (95) θ A = Q e q , a d s Q e q , m a x = K e q A C e q ( 1 + K e q A C e q ) Here, θA is the dimensionless surface species concentration, Qeq,ads is the current equilibrium adsorption surface concentration (mol/gcat), Qeq,max is the maximum equilibrium adsorption surface concentration (mol/gcat), KA eq indicates the adsorption equilibrium constant (L/mol) and Ceq represents the gas phase concentration of the species at equilibrium (mol/L) The linear representation of Langmuir adsorption isotherm is (96) 1 Q e q , a d s = 1 Q e q , m a x K e q A C e q + 1 Q e q , m a x There is no remarkable change of adsorption constants with respect to light irradiation. Hence, it is concluded that the adsorption parameters established without light irradiation (dark) are sufficient for the kinetic modelling during the light irradiation experiment. The results revealed that equimolar concentration of hydrogen (H ) and hydroxyl ( OH) radicals were produced during the photocatalytic hydrogen production (a detailed analysis and calculation is given in the original literature [193]). The proposed mechanism of “In Series–Parallel” reaction network for the ethanol conversion during photocatalytic H2 production is schematically shown in Fig. 33 . The main assumptions for the kinetic model are (a) ethanol and other intermediate species could be adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface (b) ethanol and other intermediate species are not influenced by photolysis, and (c) adsorption is a dynamic equilibrium process. The following conditions are also considered to develop an “In Series–Parallel” kinetic model: (d) 0.15 g/L of 1 wt % Pt-TiO2 (Degussa P25) as photocatalyst in the slurry phase (e) pH 4 (f) utilization of near-UV photons (λ < 410 nm) to promote the oxidation/reduction at the photocatalyst surface (g) ethanol initial concentration 2 v/v %, and (h) h+ reacts with –OH to produce OH radicals and e– favours the formation of H radicals. The photo-conversion of ethanol through OH radicals leads to the formation of H2, methane (CH4), ethane (C2H4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetic acid (CH3COOH) (i) the formation of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) intermediate is neglected (j) formation of H2 via steps 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 33), and (k) formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through step 5. LH rate equation for the ethanol conversion during the photocatalytic H2 production can be described as: (97) r E t O H V L = d N E t O H d t = - V L C E t O H ( k 1 + k 2 + k 4 + k 5 ) 1 + K E t O H A C E t O H + K A A A C A A + K E t O H A C E t O H + K H 2 A C H 2 + K C O 2 A C C O 2 + K E A C E + K M A C M Where CAA , CE and CM are the concentration of acetic acid, ethane and methane, respectively. The above Eq. (13) can be considered, as the concentration of ethanol is higher with respect to other intermediates in the liquid phase. The experiments revealed that ethanol is the superior adsorbed species as compared to other intermediates. Therefore, KA EtOH CEtOH >> KA H2 CH2 + KA CO2 CCO2 + KA E CE + KA M CM . The ordinary differential equations for the changes in concentration of the intermediates can be described as follows: For CH3COOH (AA) (98) d N A A d t = V L ( k 2 C E t O H - k 3 C A A ) 1 + K E t O H A C E t O H For CO2 (99) d N C O 2 d t = V L [ k 1 + k 4 C E t O H + k 3 C A A ] 1 + K E t O H A C E t O H For C2H6 (E) (100) d N E d t = V L C E t O H ( 1 / 2 k 4 + k 5 ) 1 + K E t O H A C E t O H For CH4 (M) (101) d N M d t = V L ( k 1 C E t O H + k 3 C A A ) 1 + K E t O H A C E t O H For H2 (102) d N H 2 d t = V L C E t O H ( 2 k 1 + 2 k 2 + 2.5 k 4 ) 1 + K E t O H A C E t O H The proposed kinetic model was predicted well the experimentally perceived quasi-linear trend of H2 production under light irradiation (Fig. 34 ). Nevertheless, there was around 35% of difference between the model predictions and experimental results. This was ascribed to the following reasons: (a) reaction temperatures are higher than the supercritical temperature of CO2 (29.14 °C), and (b) solubility of CO2 at pH 4. Therefore, the equation for the concentration of H2 was revised with a term α (0.65). Fig. 35 , clearly shows that the experimental data fits well with the revised kinetic model. (103) d N H 2 d t = α V L C E t O H ( 2 k 1 + 2 k 2 + 2.5 k 4 ) 1 + K E t O H A C E t O H In a very recent study, novel concepts such as initial rate of photon absorption (IRPA) and boundary layer of photon absorption in dimensionless form were established to evaluate the impact of photocatalyst dosage on the total rate of photon absorption (TRPA- overall radiation absorbed in the entire photo-reactor volume) [259]. A six-flux absorption scattering model (SFM) [260,261] was utilized to study and model the solar/light radiation transport through the slurry photocatalyst suspension (TiO2 P25 and goethite (α-FeOOH) were used as photocatalysts). According to SFM approach, LVRPA can be calculated as follows: (104) e a x = I 0 τ a p p ω c o r r 1 - γ L [ ω c o r r - 1 + 1 - ω c o r r 2 e - x τ a p p L + γ ω c o r r - 1 - 1 - ω c o r r 2 e x τ a p p L ] Where a, b, ωcorr and γ are SFM parameters. τapp is the apparent thickness. L is the length of the extinction of light inside the photo-reactor. (105) a = 1 - ω p f - 4 ω 2 p s 2 1 - ω p f - ω p b - 2 ω p s (106) b = ω p b + 4 ω 2 p s 2 1 - ω p f - ω p b - 2 ω p s (107) ω c o r r = b a (108) γ = 1 - 1 - ω c o r r 2 1 + 1 - ω c o r r 2 e - 2 τ a p p (109) τ a p p = a τ 1 - ω c o r r 2 For a planar geometry, τ = σ * + κ * C c a t L (110) I R P A = - [ d d x e a ( x ) ] | x = 0 (111)The following equation can be obtained by applying the values of (ea(x)) (112) I R P A = - I 0 ω c o r r 1 - γ τ a p p L 2 [ γ ω c o r r - 1 - 1 - ω c o r r 2 - ω c o r r - 1 + 1 - ω c o r r 2 ] By introducing the values of τapp and τ, it was found that the IRPA was related to the photocatalyst concentration or loading (Ccat ) (113) I R P A = - I 0 C c a t 2 ψ Where ψ is given by (114) ψ = β * 2 a 2 ( 1 - ω c o r r 2 ) ω c o r r 1 - γ [ γ ω c o r r - 1 - 1 - ω c o r r 2 - ω c o r r - 1 + 1 - ω c o r r 2 ] (115) β * = σ * + κ * The differences in the rate of photon absorption should be considered when comparing the efficiency of different photocatalytic materials in a slurry suspension. The results showed that the extinction of light follows a second order dependency on the photocatalyst loading. The findings of this study would be beneficial to design and scale up various types of photo-reactors (solar, slurry, planar, etc.) with improved optical properties."
6,Photo-reactors design for H2 production,"Researchers studying H2 production most commonly use custom-made photo-reactors. The photoreactors are made up of quartz or pyrex with 50 ml–100 ml capacity. The reactions are carried out with 50 ml–70 ml of empty gas phase. The reactor should be a tightly closed setup to avoid any gas leakage during the photocatalysis reaction and it should also have the required gas inlet and outlet. A Xenon lamp with 300 W to 500 W is commonly used as light irradiation source. The activity of a photocatalyst is examined in the presence of either UV light or visible light or simulated solar light (without any optical filters). Visible light experiments are performed using appropriate UV light filters. The light source may be placed on either inside (Type I) or outside (Type II) the glass reactor (Fig. 36 ). In type I photoreactors, a portable light irradiation source is placed inside at the centre of the reactor. While in type II, the light irradiation source is placed at a particluar distance from the reactors. The distance between the light source and the reactor is predicted by measuring the light intensity using a Lumen meter. Type I reactors are more convenient for the effective ultilization of photons because the light can spread to the reaction mixture from all the directions, hence more active surface area of the catalyst will be exposed to light. The reactor should be vacuumized first to remove the air and the reaction mixture is purged with Ar or N2 gas for 30 min–60 min before the light irradiation. A mass flow controller should be used in the purging process for the uniformity and repeatability of the experiments. In both cases, a magnetic stirrer is placed at the bottom of reactor to continously stir the slurry to prevent the deposition or accumulation of photocatalyst. Under prolonged light irradiation, the temperature of the reaction mixture will raise. At high temperatures, the H2 production efficiency is decreased because of the de-trapping of photo-generated carriers. The exothermic adsorption of reactants to the catalyst surface will also be hindered. Hence, it is very important to keep the temperature of the reaction mixture constant throughout the entire course of the photoreaction. This will be achieved through a proper water-cooling system and ventilation fans [262]. The reactions are carried out under prolonged light irradiation for 6 h – 10 h. The evolved H2 gas is analyzed peroidically using gas chromatography (GC) with a thermal conductivity detector. A moleuclar seive or carbosphere packed column is used commonly to analyze the gas samples in GC. In most of the cases, the evolved H2 was injected manually into the GC using a gas tight syringe. In recent times, some researchers are also using an online GC. However, it is very expensive when compared to the normal GC. Muñoz-Batista et al. [263] suggested that the photo-physical events are particularly important to rule the photo-chemical activity of the system. A radiation model was studied for the lamp (both UV and visible) emission properties and the radiation field interaction with the catalyst inside the photo-reactor. The parameters such as radiation incidence efficiency (ηI ) and radiation absorption efficiency (ηA ) could be used to compare the configuration of photo-reactors and the photocatalytic activity of the samples in terms of its efficiency to utilize the light. ηI could be enhanced when the lamp is positioned at the central axis of the annular reactor [264]. Using of reflecting mirror is also beneficial to improve this parameter. ηA is related to the superficial rate of photon absorption (e a,s) with the incident radiation flow at the photocatalyst surface/film. Moreover, ηI and ηA are independent of the operation conditions and reaction parameters. ηI values can be calculated as follows (116) η I = ∫ A ∫ λ q λ d λ d A ∑ L = 1 L = 7 ∫ λ P λ , L d λ × 100 ηA values can be calculated as follows (117) η A = ∫ A ∫ λ e λ a , s d λ d A ∫ A ∫ λ q λ d λ d A × 100 The photocatalytic activity under light irradiation can be calculated in terms of quantum (ηq) and photonic (ηp ) efficiencies. (118) η q = r A e a , s A × 100 (119) η p = r A q A × 100 Where A is absorption, λ is wavelength, p is emission power, L is a factor relative to lamp, r is superficial reaction rate, ea,s is the local superficial rate of photon absorption (calculated from transmittance and reflectance spectra of the sample), and q is local net radiation flux. Preethi and Kanmani [265] examined the performance of four different (Type I, Type II, tubular type with outer irradiation (Type III) and trapezoidal type with outer irradiation (Type IV)) photo-reactors for H2 production using sulphide wastewater and (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 photo-catalyst. The schematic and photographs of the four photo-reactors are displayed in Fig. 37 . All the photo-reactors have different dimensions, but the capacity of the reactor was fixed as 500 ml. Type I reactor was made of borosilicate and the other three types were made of acrylic. In each case, the experiments were carried out for 1 h and the suspension was purged with N2 for 1 h before starting the light irradiation. The operating parameters such as light intensity, pH, photocatalyst loading and sulphide/sulphite concentrations were optimized. The achieved H2 production rate of Type I photo-reactor is very high (7857 μmol/h) when compared to the other configurations (Type II = 938 μmol/h; Type III = 580 μmol/h; and Type IV = 1116 μmol/h). Maximum H2 production efficiency was attained in a reactor with an inner light irradiation source. This is ascribed to the photocatalyst being able directly absorb more photons in type I reactor, whereas, the distance between the light source and suspension was 30 cm in the reactors with outer light irradiation, and hence the photocatalyst could not absorb more photons. Among the three outer irradiation type reactors, Type IV with trapezoidal configuration showed good efficiency. This is attributed to the reactor with flat surface being able to absorb more light when compared to tubular and cylindrical reactors. The pilot scale studies will be conducted with Type IV reactor in the future because the cylindrical Type I reactors are considered not feasible for practical applications. Even though, the direct water splitting reaction can be executed in a single reactor, one of the main disadvantages is the necessity of separating H2/O2 during the process. The continuous irradiation of the reaction mixture without removing the formed products can lead to a photo-stationary state. In this state, the forward and backward reactions attain equilibrium because the catalyst for water splitting can also act as favorable catalyst for H2 and O2 recombination. This problem can be resolved via cycling the reaction mixture in a transparent semipermeable polymer pipe which separates H2 and O2. The molecular sieving effect (H2 = 2.9 Å; O2 = 3.5 Å) of the polymer membrane is utilized for the effective separation of H2 and O2 gases [266]. H2 can be easily diffused through the polymer membrane owing to its small atomic size. The formed H2 and O2 gases are stored in separate tanks. The scale-up process of photocatalytic water splitting has many complications in terms of dispersion, separation and collection of photocatalyst. Highly active, stable and inexpensive materials are required to design a cost effective photo-reactor. Jing et al. demonstrated the feasibility of a natural solar light driven photo-reactor using the solar light concentrator (compound parabolic collector (CPC)) to receive maximum light intensity [267] (Fig. 38 ). It is a double bed photo-reactor where H2 production occurs in one bed and the sacrificial agent is regenerated in another. This reactor is kept under direct sunlight and the aperture of CPC is placed perpendicular to the incident light. The reaction parameters (tube radius, flow velocity, photocatalyst loading and sacrificial agent concentration) were optimized. The flow of the slurry was adjusted to Reynolds number between 10000 and 50000 to avoid the sedimentation and accumulation of photocatalyst. The maximum hydrogen production rate was 1.88 L/h using 1 g/L of TiO2. However, the achieved quantum efficiency of the reaction was very low (0.47%). This might be attributed to the difference in the slurry pressure gradient in the reactor. Moreover, it is found that the catalyst is deposited at the bottom of reactor tank. Due to the bed formation of the catalyst, excess pressure is dropped in the system and it leads to a decrease in effective surface area for the photocatalysis reaction. In another study, the photocatalytic H2 production was investigated using a propeller-fluidized photo-reactor (PFPR) under UV and natural solar light irradiation [268]. A solar telescope was used as an alternative to CPC for solar light experiments. The reactor was made up of quartz with a stainless steel flange and a motor in the bottom. The total volume of the reactor is 210 ml. The photocatalytic H2 production experiments were conducted using 100 ml of reaction mixture (0.025 M of oxalic acid in Milli-Q-water and 100 mg of photocatalyst) and 110 ml of gas headspace. Pt-C3N4 and NaTaO3.La were used as photocatalysts for UV and solar light, respectively. The fluidization was achieved via the rotation of a 38 mm 4-blade SS 316 propeller placed at the bottom of the reactor. The propeller was operated by a 12 dcV motor to attain a rotation speed in the range of 0–1730 rpm. The reaction mixture was initially purged with Ar for 30 min at 289 rpm before the light irradiation. The rotation speed was increased to the desired level during the light irradiation. The reactions were carried out for 6 h and the H2 production was analysed periodically using a GC-TCD. UV light irradiation was provided through four 36 W compact non-integrated fluorescent lamps with nine air blow fans. The schematic of the photo-reactor and the photographs of UV lamp set up are displayed in Fig. 39 . The photo-reactor was placed at the centre. A George Ellery Hale solar telescope with a series of angled mirrors and illumination shafts (Fig. 40 ) was used to concentrate the natural solar light. For UV light, the H2 production rate is increased (at 0 rpm and at 1035 rpm) with increase of propeller speed from 0 rpm (24 μmol h−1 g-1) to 1035 rpm (89 μmol h−1 g-1) (Fig. 41 ). This is ascribed to high mass transfer, cavitation of the aqueous medium, strong light penetration and conversion of laminar to turbulent flow. The cavitation process was started at 289 rpm. The major limitation of this design is low levels of H2 production under dark conditions because of stainless steel corrosion by oxalic acid. (120) Fe→Fe2++ 2e (121) 2H++ 2e→H2 H2 production efficiency under natural solar light is lower (5 μmol h−1 g-1) than the efficiency under artificial light. This is attributed to the weather, exposure of light to various contaminants (the light path length is approximately 40 ft) and variable nature of solar light. Baniasadi et al. [269] reported the exergy (energy available to be used) and environmental impact assessment of solar photo-reactors. The schematic of photo-reactor setup for water splitting and methanol reforming systems is shown in Fig. 42 . A detailed schematic of a hybrid photo-reactor is displayed in Fig. 43 . The continuous operation of photo-reactor was analysed for the water splitting and methanol steam reforming systems under large-scale process conditions. An exergy-environmental analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of these two photoreactions based on the operational conditions. Electrodes were used to consume the photo-generated holes and transfer the photo-induced electrons for H2 production. Both the solar light concentrator (CPC was used to concentre the natural sunlight) and UV–vis lamp (500 W high pressure Hg lamp) were placed at the reactor. An anion exchange membrane was used to separate H2 and O2 gases. The turbulent flow was fixed through the Reynolds number between 10,000 and 50,000 to avoid the sedimentation and accumulation of TiO2 photocatalyst. 10 L of water was used to recirculate in the hydraulic loop. For water splitting, the photocatalyst was suspended in water and it was circulated through the hydraulic loop. For methanol steam reforming, the photocatalyst was immobilized in a packed tubular bed. The main findings of this study are described briefly. The exergy efficiency of water splitting system was increased nearly 15% by conducting the experiments at 15 °C as compared to 25 °C A maximum H2 production rate (2 L h−1) was attained at a flow rate of 6 L min−1 and the light intensity was the key parameter to influence the H2 production efficiency. An optimum water-methanol mole ratio was 1.5–2 for methanol steam reforming. The exergy efficiency and CO2 emission (nearly 1 kg kWh−1 of CO2 emission at a solar intensity of 3000 W) of the methanol steam reforming system was increased by increasing the intensity of solar light. The physical and chemical exergy losses of methanol steam reforming system were higher than that of water splitting system. The optimum light intensity range of methanol steam reforming system was 530 W m-2 < J < 600 W m-2 to avoid high CO2 emission."
7,Recent innovations in water splitting,
8,2D photocatalysts,"5.1 2D photocatalysts When metal dopants are used to enrich H2 production, the interfacial charge transfer process is restrained by the small area of point contact between the zero-dimensional (0D) metal dopants and TiO2. To address this problem, two-dimensional (2D) photocatalysts have widely been employed with metal dopants in recent years [270–276]. The electronic and physical properties of 0D (e.g. nanoparticles), 1D (e.g. nanotubes or nanowires) and 2D (e.g. nanosheets) nanomaterials are shown in Fig. 44 (a) [277]. The low dimensional nanomaterials could be easily assembled into various hetero-structures (Fig. 44(b)) such as 0D–1D, 0D–2D, 1D–2D and 2D–2D via strong van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The light absorption capability of these hetero-structures is intensified through high charge transfer, field effect, metal doping, SPR, defect density and strain [277]. Among the various low dimensional materials, 2D materials possess some unique features, such as morphology with maximum photo-induced charge transfer, promising electronic/optical properties and high specific surface area with abundant active sites [278]. The schematic for the screening of 2D photocatalysts for H2 production is displayed in Fig. 45 . For effective water splitting, the 2D materials must satisfy significant characteristics such as thermodynamically stable, insoluble in water (materials with formation energy below 200 meV/atom), possess bandgap energy > 1.23 eV and appropriate band edge positions for water splitting. The electronic properties of 2D materials are directly connected to its phases, edges and composition. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) are commonly used 2D photocatalysts for water splitting because the crystalline phases and edges of TMD can be easily tuned [279,280]. The sulphur rich materials can preferentially absorb the reactants at the edges [281–283]. Moreover, 2D TMD absorbs photon in the range of 0.5–2 eV [284,285] whereas the bulk TMD only absorbs photon up to 1.4 eV. TMD are mainly composed of d-block (transition metal) and p-block (anion) elements. They are generally synthesized by sol-gel, physical vapour deposition, chemical vapour deposition, liquid phase exfoliation and atomic layer deposition techniques. MoS2 is the most widely studied 2D TMD for TiO2 in photocatalytic water splitting. A schematic of recently studied TiO2/MoS2 hetero-structures are shown in Figs. 46–48 . In all cases, H2 production efficiencies of 2D TiO2/MoS2 hetero-structures are higher as compared to usual metal-doped TiO2 and 0D TiO2/MoS2. This is ascribed to the availability of large contact area in the 2D hetero-structures. A higher number of transparent channels is provided by the large contact area for effective charge transfer and migration. Liu et al. [276] suggested that MoS2 sheets could create a conductive superaerophobic surface to reduce gas bubble adhesion, offering a constant active surface area. H2 production efficiency of TiO2 with octahedral phase MoS2 (TiO2/1 T MoS2) is 8 times higher than that of TiO2 with trigonal prismatic phase MoS2 (TiO2/2H MoS2). The high efficiency of TiO2/1 T MoS2 is ascribed to the availability of additional active sites on the basal plane. The probability of electron-hole recombination is minimized due to the short path length of the electron (Fig. 48). The photocatalytic activity of symmetric MoS2 tipped CdS nanowires (2D MoS2@1D CdS) was studied for H2 production under visible light irradiation [274]. The efficiency of 2D MoS2@1D CdS (12.6 mmol h−1 g−1) is superior as compared to Pt@CdS (2.6 mmol h−1 g−1). This is ascribed to the availability of more catalytic active sites at the MoS2 tip and CdS stem. (0001) crystal plane of CdS is tipped with (001) crystal plane of S through Cd-S-Mo chemical bond (Fig. 49 (b)). The energy barrier (Fig. 49(c)) for the electron transfer from the chemically bonded 2D MoS2@1D CdS interface is lower (0.58 eV) than that of the physical mixture (6.82 eV). DOS results (Fig. 49 (d)) revealed that the fermi level of 2D MoS2@1D CdS is located above the Fermi level of MoS2@CdS physical mixture. Hence, the electron injection form CdS into MoS2 is progressed via the chemical bonds. The light absorption property of TMD could be easily tuned by changing the number of layers [287]. The VB maximum (VBM) and CB minimum (CBM) of TMD with different layers were determined using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation function. The band edge positions of MoS2 and other TMD are varied with respect to the number of layers (Fig. 50 ). For example, the bandgap energy of MoS2 is increased from 0.9 eV to 1.6 eV when the number of layers are decreased from the bulk to monolayer. This might be attributed to the quantum confinement effect, d-orbital splitting and p-d orbital interaction. The VBM and CBM positions of TMD are dominated by the d orbitals splitting [288]. The incompletely filled d orbitals of transition metals could be easily interacted with the p orbitals of anions. The CBM of TMD mainly originates from the antibonding states of M-dz 2, P-px and P-py orbitals while the VBM is ruled by the bonding states of M-dx2-y2 and M-dxy orbitals (Fig. 51 ). The d-orbital splitting energy is higher when the electronegativity difference between transition metal and anion is higher. In addition to that, the d-orbital splitting is also changed when the co-ordination environment is different. The H2 production rate of 2D materials also relies on the interface area between the photocatalyst and co-catalyst [289]. An interface with high contact area could offer appropriate trapping and charge transfer channels for effective electron-hole separation. Using of 2D-2D interfaces could accelerate charge transfer and separation when compared to 0D-2D and 1D-2D interfaces. Two methods such as inter-plane and intra-plane are used to construct 2D-2D interfaces (Fig. 52 ). The photo-generated electron-hole separation process is promoted through Z-scheme and Schottky barrier mechanisms. The photocatalytic H2 production activity of 2D-2D g-C3N4 nano-sheets/ZnIn2S4 nano-leaves was examined under visible light irradiation [290]. The efficiency of g-C3N4 nano-sheets/ZnIn2S4 nano-leaves (2D-2D) is ∼8.2 times higher than that of g-C3N4 nano-sheets/ZnIn2S4 micro-spheres (2D-0D). This is ascribed to the 2D-2D interface providing more contact area and high speed charge transfer channels as compared to 2D-0D interface (Fig. 53 )."
9,Perovskites for H2 production,"5.2 Perovskites for H2 production Perovskites are one of the most promising set of photocatalysts owing to their tolerance to defects, unique characteristics, compositional and structural diversity [291]. The physicochemical properties of perovskites can be easily tuned via replacing the cation or anion in the skeleton. Most of the perovskites are wide bandgap semiconductors and the general molecular formula of perovskites is ABO3. Wherein, “A” (e.g. rare or alkaline earth metals) and “B” (e.g. first row transition metals) are occupied by the large and small cations, respectively. The photocatalytic properties of perovskites are mainly originated form their exceptional crystal structure [291]. Generally, perovskites have a cubic structure (Fig. 54 ) with a corner-connecting network of BO6 octahedral (“B” is positioned in the centre) and 12 oxygen coordinated “A” cations (“A” is located between eight BO6 octahedral at the middle of the cube). “A” site is weakly bonded with oxygen while the “B” site is strongly bonded to oxygen. The lattice distortion (via tilting of octahedra) of ABO3 relies on the ionic radii and electronegativity of “A” and “B” cations [292]. The crystal structure of various perovskite oxides are displayed in Fig. 55 . Different crystalline phases such as rhombohedral, monoclinic, triclinic, orthogonal, and tetragonal are formed through the lattice distortion and the modification of cations [292]. The crystal structure is strongly influenced by the synthesis method. Hydrothermal method is most commonly used to synthesis perovskites due to its less complications and cost effectiveness [294,295]. Titanates with a molecular formula of ATiO3 are widely used as photocatalyts for water splitting reaction. The crystal structure of ATiO3 are modified by replacing the A cations. The rotation of oxygen octahedra has a significant impact on the dipole and electronic band structures of titanates, influencing photo-generated charge carrier separation, migration and transfer [301]. The octahedra rotations directly influence the TiO bond length and TiOTi bond angle due to the relocation of oxygen atoms from the edges [301]. Consequently, the photocatalytic performance of ATiO3 are mainly controlled by Ti 3d orbital and O 2p orbital hybridization. SrTiO3 [302], BaTiO3 [303], CaTiO3 [304], MgTiO3 [305]and NiTiO3 [306] were reported for the photocatalytic H2 production activity. Various dopants and narrow bandgap semiconductors were coupled with these titanates to improve the electron-hole separation process and extend the light absorption. Some of the key findings of recently reported titanates for H2 production are presented briefly in the following section. La and Cr (La/Cr) doped hollow CaTiO3 cubes were examined for photocatalytic water splitting [307]. The H2 production efficiency of La/Cr doped CaTiO3 cubes is higher than that of pure CaTiO3. The peculiar cube morphology of CaTiO3 shortens the charge migration pathway and improves photon-matter interaction (Fig. 56 (a) and (b)). Also, Cr doping induces the formation spin polarized VB inside the original bandgap of CaTiO3 (Fig. 56 (c)). Meng et al. [308] reported the H2 production efficiency of a tri-phase (MgTiO3/MgTi2O5/TiO2) hetero-junction with nano-belt morphology under UV light irradiation. H2 production efficiency of MgTiO3/MgTi2O5/TiO2 (356.1 mol·g0.1gcat h−1) is two times higher than that of pure TiO2 nano-belts. This is attributed to the maximum light utilization, more active sites, special 1D belt morphology, and high electron-hole separation on the tri-phase hetero-junction (Fig. 57 ) In another study, the photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3-Ba2FeNbO6 perovskite was evaluated under visible light irradiation [309]. Perovskites with narrow bandgap is constructed by the two different metal cations on the “B” site of ABO3. It is predicted that Ba2FeNbO6 has a similar cubic crystal structure (Ti4+ is substituted by Nb5+ and Fe3+) like BaTiO3 (Fig. 58 (a)). Moreover, Ba2FeNbO6 is a narrow bandgap (2.29 eV) photocatalyst with appropriate band edge positions for water splitting. The results also suggested that the elements on the “B” site have a strong influence on the bandgap energy. UV–vis results revealed that Ba2FeNbO6 could absorb maximum visible light when compared to BaTiO3 (Fig. 58(c)). The highest H2 production efficiency is shown by the nanocomposite of SrTiO3-Ba2FeNbO6 with a molar ratio of 10:0.5 (bandgap = 2.92 eV). In addition to the 2D materials and perovskites, some other novel photocatalysts have also been developed in recent years [187,218,310–340] for H2 production. The activity of the photocatalysts is enriched by tuning the crystal structure, morphology and electronic properties. The crucial findings of selected TiO2 photocatalysts are highlighted briefly. The photocatalytic activity of hierarchical CdS/mesoporous TiO2/graphene ternary nano-composite (CdS/m-TiO2/G) was studied under visible light irradiation [341]. The photocatalyst was synthesized through an electrostatic assembly (negative-positive-negative) technique (Fig. 59 (i)). H2 production efficiency of CdS/m-TiO2/G is two times higher than that of pure CdS or TiO2. The electric tri-layer (m-TiO2/Cd2+/GO) is highly favourable for the photo-stability, uniform dispersion of CdS in the core-shell structure (Fig. 59(ii)) and the strong interfacial binding of CdS/m-TiO2/G. The photocatalytic activity and charge carrier separation process (Fig. 59(ii)) are enhanced by the atomic-scaled heterojunction. Moreover, nearly 82% of the initial photocatalytic activity is retained after 15 recycle experiments during 80 h of visible light irradiation (Fig. 59(iii)). In another study, the charge separation and transfer of mesoporous carbonate doped TiO2 nanotubes (C/TiO2 NT) was examined for the photocatalytic H2 production [342]. The photocatalyst was synthesized via an olive oil-assisted electrospinning technique. The efficiency of C/TiO2 NT is six times (6108 μmol g−1 h−1) higher than that of TiO2 P25. The effect of carbonate doping on the electronic structure of TiO2 was studied by DFT calculations (generalized gradient approximation with a Hubbard parameter (GGA + U) model). New energy levels are introduced near the CB and VB of TiO2 by carbonate doping, indicating the bandgap energy is reduced (Fig. 60 (a) and (c)). Electron difference density maps suggest that σ bonds are mostly formed through the interaction of C 2p and O sp orbitals in the deep valance region (Fig. 60(b) and (d)). The porous architecture is beneficial for effective mass transfer, supply of more active sites and absorption of more light. The optical path length of incident light is increased via the multiple reflection effect of the porous architecture (Fig. 60(e)). The transfer and separation of photo-generated charge carriers in the nano-composite are improved by the close homo-junction between anatase and rutile phase TiO2 (Fig. 60 (e)). The photo-generated electrons on the surface of TiO2 are rapidly transferred into the active sites via the electrostatic force of carbonate dopant. In another study, the H2 production efficiency was examined on gradient ternary TiO2-Au-CdS photonic crystals (materials that can block the light of certain wavelengths/frequencies from propagating any number of polarization directions inside the material) with three dimensionally ordered macro-porous (3DOM) network under visible light irradiation [343]. 3DOM of TiO2 is beneficial for the strong light penetration and effective mass transfer whereas CdS is responsible for visible light absorption and Au is accountable for the constructive electron transfer. The enhanced H2 production efficiency of TiO2-Au-CdS is attributed to the slow photon effect (a structural effect that could generate more charge carriers) of photonic crystals (Fig. 61 ). Slow photon effect is achieved by tuning the macro-pore size of the 3D skeleton to match the photonic bandgap (energy at the blue-edge and/or red edge) of TiO2-Au-CdS with the electronic bandgap energy of CdS. The optical path length of photons is increased when the blue edge or red edge photons overlap with the electronic bandgap of CdS. The slow photons at the blue edge (higher frequency edge) display maximum H2 production efficiency, compared to that of red edge (lower frequency edge). This indicates that photons with high energy are required to increase the formation of charge carriers. Zhang et al. developed a Ruddlesden-Popper compound Sr2TiO4 (layered semiconductor) co-doped with La and Fe for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production [344]. The effect of doping was investigated on the crystal structure, morphology and optical properties. H2 production efficiency of Sr1.9La0.1Ti0.9Fe0.1O4 is five times (∼106.2 μmol/h) higher than that of pristine Sr2TiO4 under UV–vis light irradiation. The unit cell of Sr2TiO4 is slightly expanded after doping with La and Fe. The lattice fringe (∼6.30 Ǻ) of Sr1.9La0.1Ti0.9Fe0.1O4 is matched well with the (002) plane along ‘c’ direction (Fig. 62 (a) and (b)). DFT calculations reveal that two spin-polarized bands are introduced in Sr2TiO4 by Fe doping. DOS results show that the CBM and VBM of Sr2TiO4 are dominated by Ti 3dxy and O 2 pz /2 px orbitals (Fig. 62(c)). The VBM and CBM of Sr2TiO4 are exclusively concealed (Fig. 63 ) in the TiO6 octahedron layer, which can provide 2D or anisotropic charge transportation properties to Sr2TiO4. This is highly effective in prohibiting the photo-generated charge carrier recombination process."
10,Summary and outlook,"In this review, we summarize the significant perspectives of metal-doped TiO2 for photocatalytic H2 production. Loading of metal dopants on TiO2 is shown to be a promising route to enhance the charge-carrier separation on the catalyst surface and red shift the absorption maxima to the visible region. The outer shell electronic configuration and atomic radius of metal dopants should be considered for selecting the dopants. Pt (via Schottky barrier formation), Au and Cu (via SPR) have proved as effective electron traps to amplify the H2 production efficiency of TiO2 owing to their high work function. H2 production yield and the electron transfer mechanism of dopants are strongly ruled by the nature of light irradiation source such as UV, visible and UV–vis or simulated solar light. The kinetics and mechanism of metal-doped TiO2 have been reviewed in detail. Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) is the most widely used model to express the rate of H2 production using metal-doped TiO2 photocatalyst. It is noted that most of the recent studies for TiO2 water splitting have been performed using bimetallic dopants. Simulated solar light or UV–vis light with bimetallic dopants (metal/metal or metal/non-metal) are the foremost choice to achieve maximum H2 production efficiency for TiO2. Also, 2D materials and perovskites have been used as photocatalysts in recent years to improve the H2 generation rate. Feasible photo-reactor designs for the lab scale and piolet scale for H2 production are discussed. However, there is still no clear information on the design of a photo-reactor to evaluate the H2 production efficiency. Almost all the research studies have been executed at laboratory scale using custom-made micro reactors in the range of 50–100 ml with various headspace volumes. There are no transparent knowledge on data (efficiency) interpretation from the GC measurement during the experiments. The efficiency may raise if we use more headspace volume in our reactions. Several investigations need to be carried out in the future to enrich the photocatalytic H2 production at the pilot scale under natural sunlight. Steps should also be taken for commercialization of this technology. Numerous metal and non-metal dopants have been reported to amplify the H2 production efficiency of TiO2. Conversely, there are no suitable alternatives still today to replace the very expensive Pt and Au dopants to achieve maximum quantum efficiency. From the economic point of view, the development of cost effective photocatalysts is still a great challenge. Because very expensive dopants and toxic sacrificial agents (e.g. alcohols, amines, sulphides) have been used in ultrapure water to produce H2 gas in the range of μL to mL. There is no standard rule available to select a sacrificial agent and fix its concentration for an oxide, carbon and sulfide photocatalyst. Future studies in water splitting should be focused on the following aspects; thermally stable photocatalysts, use of inexpensive materials, non-toxic/in-situ sacrificial agents, non-sacrificial H2 production and using of industrial effluent/wastewater/seawater. More studies should also be carried out to understand the kinetics of metal-doped TiO2 for water splitting. Standards such as ISO, ASTM, and JIS to validate the H2 production efficiency of photocatalysts should be developed. In the current scenario, theoretical or computational modelling (e.g. DFT) is a mandate to fabricate a photocatalyst with more active sites, utmost light harvesting property, sufficient crystal defects, required crystalline phases, suitable electronic properties, high surface area, and limited charge carrier recombination centres. Therefore, the combination of theoretical and experimental studies will be the optimal approach to understand the basic principles behind the H2 production efficiency of metal-doped TiO2."
