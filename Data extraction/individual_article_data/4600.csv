0,Introduction,"Patulin is a toxic mycotoxin produced by certain species of fungi belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium and Byssochlamyss mold species that are commonly found on fruits (Anene et al., 2016). Its IUPAC name is lactone (4-hydroxy-4H-furo [3,2-c] pyran-2 [6 H] -one). Patulin is formed in many vegetables, fruits and grains that are especially affected by decay, but it has been reported to occur mostly in apple based products (Oroian et al., 2014). In the 1940s, patulin was considered to be antibiotic. However, several studies showed that patulin had toxic effects on both fungi/bacteria and animals/plants (Kharandi et al., 2013). It is also reported that health problems such as agitation, convulsions, congestion, ulceration, oedema, hyperemia, intestinal inflammation, epithelial cell degeneration, immune-toxic, neuro-toxic, hepato-toxic, geno-toxic, teratogenic and carcinogenic effects may occur depending on the intake of excess patulin in the body (Song et al., 2014; Moake et al., 2005). For these reasons, some international agencies have introduced legal limits for patulin in fruit and vegetables. For instance, according to the European Union (EU), the acceptable level of patulin is 10 μg kg−1 for infant apple juice and 50 μg kg−1 for non-infant apple juices (Commission Regulation, 2006). In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have reported a maximum level of patulin in apple juice ingredients at 50 μg kg−1 (FDA, 2003). Therefore, it is of great importance to develop new, selective and inexpensive analytical methods for the determination of patulin in fruit juices. Therefore, different detection techniques such as micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) (Víctor-Ortega et al., 2013), injection-port derivatization coupled to gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) (Marsol-Vall et al., 2016), capillary electrophoresis (CE) (Ibáñez et al., 2016), ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (UPLC-PDA) (Maragos et al., 2015), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) (Li et al., 2018) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) (Chanique et al., 2013) have been used and suggested by chemists and food engineers for determination of patulin in fruit juices, beverages and foods. these techniques are sensitive, but have disadvantages such as high cost and require expert-user. Especially in studies, where the appropriate selective chemical medium for the analyte is formed, spectrophotometry stands out for its simplicity, cheapness and fast (Altunay et al., 2018a; Altunay, 2018). However, accurate and reliable determination of trace amounts of patulin is often difficult due to insufficient sensitivity of this technique and the complexity of matrices of real samples. Sample preparation procedures are the first step for the separation and preconcentration of the analytes from the sample matrix. Moreover, sample preparationis one of the important steps affecting the sensitivity and selectivity of an analytical method (Cui et al., 2015). If the analyte is separated from the sample matrix well, sensitivity and selectivity increase. Before the spectrophotometric analysis, the application of liquid phase microextraction (LPME) (Dadfarnia and Shabani, 2010) for the analyte can make the method more attractive (Abdolmohammad-Zadeh, & Sadeghi, 2010). For this purpose, several extraction procedures including vortex-assisted liquid–liquid microextraction (VA-LLME) (Abu-Bakar et al., 2014), ionic liquid-based dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (IL-DLLME) (Mohammadi et al., 2013), binary solvents-based dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (BS-DLLME) (Maham et al., 2013), solid-phase extraction (SPE) (Yu and Fan, 2017), magnetic solid phase extraction (mSPE) (Wang et al., 2017), and liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) (Beltrán et al., 2014) were developed for separation and preconcentration of the patulin from different samples. Although the above extraction methods were widely used, they have limitations in terms of organic solvent and cost. Therefore, When developing a new method according to the scientific community, it is strongly recommended to consider “green chemistry” characteristics for the environment and human health.So, studies using organic solvents have decreased (Tang et al., 2015). In this sense, green solvents, such as supercritical fluids, and ionic liquids (ILs), have replaced the organic solvents over the last two decades. The ILs have negligible vapor pressure, re-usability and high viscosity (Altunay et al., 2018b). And these properties facilitate the separation of the analyte from sample matrix. Despite these properties, the anions and cations of the IL have been reported to be highly toxic and poorly biodegradable (Xia et al., 2015). In addition, the synthesis of ILs is quite expensive. For this reason, chemists have been directed to the synthesis of novel, cheap and non-toxic solvents. As a result of these studies, a new ionic solvent known as a deep eutectic solvent (DES) has emerged (Bi et al., 2013). DESs are an advanced class of solvents with properties such as biodegradable components, non-flammability due to none measurable vapor pressure and sustainability with respect to environmental and economic benefits, in addition to the interesting properties of ILs (Cunha and Fernandes, 2018). These features make DES preferable over the conventional solvents (surfactants, organic solvents etc.) used in microextraction procedures. In addition, the properties such as viscosity, density and melting point have a great influence on how and where DES can or cannot be used. Due to increasing interest, there is a proliferation of studies focusing on the physical properties of DES such as density, viscosity, ionic conductivity and pH (Taysun et al., 2016; Yusof et al., 2014). Furthermore, preparation of DESs are very simple, and easily obtained by mixing of a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) such as choline chloride (ChCl), tetrabutyl ammonium chloride (TBACl), trioctyl ammonium chloride (TOACl), with a hydrogen bond donor (HBD), such as urea, amines, carboxylic acids, alcohol, sugars, and carbohydrates at known mole ratios (García et al., 2016). Due to the superior properties of the DES solvents, they are increasingly used in different fields including, extractions (Panhwar et al., 2018), functional materials (Shishov et al., 2017), electrochemistry (Bagh et al., 2015), organic synthesis (García-Álvarez, 2015), and catalysis (López-Salas et al., 2015). DES-based extraction studies (Bağda et al., 2017; Kanberoglu et al., 2019; Yilmaz and Soylak, 2016) are widely used in analysis of inorganic/organic species such as manganese and quercetin from food, vegetable and fruit samples. In the present study, a new, simple and green ultrasound-assisted emulsification liquid phase microextraction procedure (UA-ELPME) based on alcohol-based deep eutectic solvent (DES) was developed for the extraction of the patulin from fruit juices prior to its spectrophotometric determination. As far as we know, this study is the first description of combining alcohol-based DES-UA-ELPME and spectrophotometry for the patulin analysis. Alcohol-based DES (TBACl and 2,3-butanediol, 1:3, mol ratio) and Mg(II) were chosen as the extraction solvent and complexing agent, respectively. The DES based UA-ELPME procedure was eco-friendlier, low cost and faster than many other extraction methods (SPE and LLE). Critical parameters were investigated and optimized thoroughly. After comprehensive validation studies, the method was successfully applied to the determination of trace patulin in the selected samples by matrix-matched calibration curve to control the matrix effect."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Instrument and apparatus,"2.1 Instrument and apparatus A double beam UV–vis Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800 PC model, Kyoto, Japan) including micro-volume cuvette system was used for the determination of patulin in fruit juices. An ultrasonic bath (UCS-10 model, Seoul, South Korea) was used to facilitate the extraction of patulin from sample solution to the DES phase. A centrifuge (Universal Hettich model, London, England) was used in sample preparation studies and extraction experiments. A pH-meter (pH-2005, JP Selecta, Barcelona, Spain) combined with a glass-electrode was used for pH measurements of the sample solutions. Ultra-pure water was obtained by using a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, USA)."
3,Reagents and solutions,"2.2 Reagents and solutions All the reagents used were of analytical reagent grade and no need to additional purification. Stock solution of patulin (1000 mg L−1) (≥98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared by dissolving its appropriate amount in mixture of acetonitrile (Sigma) and water (1:4, v/v). 500 mg L−1 of Mg(II) solution was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of solid Mg(NO3)2 (Sigma) in water. Working solutions were daily prepared by step-wise dilution in water/acetonitrile. All solutions were stored at 4 °C in the dark until used. Choline chloride, ChCl (Sigma), tetrabutyl ammonium chloride (TBACl), trioctyl ammonium chloride (TOACl) as a quaternary ammonium salts and ethylene glycol (>99.8%, Sigma), glycerol (>99.5%, Sigma), 1,3-butanediol (>99.0%, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1,4-butanediol (>99.0%, Merck) and 2,3-butanediol (>98.0%, Merck) as hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) were used for the formation of alcohol-based DESs. Analytic grade ethanol, methanol, acetone, acetonitrile and THF were obtained from Merck. Tris buffer solution of pH 8.0 was prepared by mixing 100 mL of 0.1 mol L−1 tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane solution and 58.4 mL of 0.1 mol L−1 HCl solutions. Before starting the experiments, all experimental materials were washed with dilute HNO3 solution (5.0%, w/v), and then rinsed three times with water and used after evaporation of the water in the oven."
4,Samples collection,"2.3 Samples collection Fruit juice samples were purchased from a local market in Sivas, Turkey. According to the labels, they were sequentially consisted of apple juice, orange juice, peach juice, apricot juice, grape juice, kiwi juice, cherry juice and mango juice. All the samples were stored at 4 °C, and brought to room temperature before analysis."
5,Sample preparation,"2.4 Sample preparation The sample preparation steps were carried out with minor modifications in the previously reported method (Ji et al., 2017). Fruit juices (5.0 mL) were added to a centrifuge tube of 50 mL with 10 mL water, along with 75 μL pectinase (Merck). The tubes were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath at 30 °C for 1 h to provide enzymatic reaction. In addition, 5.0 mL of fruit juices were added to other tubes of 50 mL without pectinase treatment. The remaining steps for fruit samples were as follows: 20 mL of extraction solvent (acetonitrile) was added to the tubes, followed by vortexing at room temperature for 2 min. The supernatants obtained after centrifugation (at 4000 rpm for 3 min) were taken into another centrifuge tube of 50 mL containing a mixture (2.0 g) of N-propylethylenediamine (PSA) and MgSO4. The tubes were shaken for 2 min at 3000 rpm with vortex. 4 mL of the obtained extracts were transferred to a test tube and dried at 45 °C under nitrogen flow at rotary evaporator. The obtained residues were dissolved with 1.0 mL of mixture of acetonitrile-water (1:1, v/v). Finally, pH of residual solutions adjusted to 7.0 using the diluted HCI or NaOH, and the solutions were filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane."
6,Preparation of alcohol-based DESs,"2.5 Preparation of alcohol-based DESs In the preparation of DES solutions, first of all, hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) and hydrogen-bond donors (HBDs) chemical species were mixed in known molar ratios in a beaker. The mixture was then heated in the changing temperature range (in range of room temperature, 20–80 °C) in the ultrasonic bath until the clear solution was obtained (Tang et al., 2015). ChCl, TBACl and TOACl were used as the HBAs. Alcohol-based chemicals like ethylene glycol, glycerol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol and 2,3-butanediol were selected as the HBDs. Several alcohol-based DESs with different the HBDs were prepared, including DES-1 (ChCl/ethylene glycol at 1:2 mol ratio), DES-2 (ChCl/glycerol at 1:3 mol ratio), DES-3 (ChCl/1,3-butanediol at 1:3 mol ratio), DES-4 (TBACl/1,4-butanediol at 1:2 mol ratio), DES-5 (TBACl/2,3-butanediol at 1:2 mol ratio), DES-6 (TOACl/1,3-butanediol at 1:3 mol ratio) and DES-7 (TOACl/glycerol at 1:3 mol ratio). The details of the work carried out were given in Table 1 ."
7,The DES based UA-ELPME procedure,"2.6 The DES based UA-ELPME procedure The obtained alcohol-based DESs as an extraction solvent were used to test the extraction of patulin from fruit juices by ultrasound-assisted emulsification liquid phase microextraction (UA-ELPME). The DESs-UA-ELPME procedure was continued as follows. First, 3 mL of the prepared sample solution including 100 μg L−1 of patulin was added to a 15-mL centrifuge tube. Then, the pH of the sample solution medium was adjusted to 8.0 by 1.2 mL of 0.1 mol L−1 tris buffer, followed by 75 μmol L−1 Mg(II) solution to the tubes to form the patulin-metal complex. After complexation (patulin-Mg), 750 μL of mixture containing extraction solvent (500 μL of DES-5) and emulsifier solvent (250 μL of acetone) were quickly added to the tubes. In order to provide the clouding event and to pass the patulin-Mg complex into DES phase, ultrasonic extraction was applied to the mixture at a frequency of 40 kHz for 12 min at room temperature. The centrifugation was carried out at 4000 rpm for 5 min for separation of the aqueous phase and the DEs phase. The DES phase was collected on the upper surface of the water and taken from the aqueous phase by using syringe. The same procedure was also applied to the blank solutions without analyte."
8,Spectrophotometric analysis,"2.7 Spectrophotometric analysis Under optimal conditions, the analysis of samples and sample blanks were performed at 304 nm using micro-volume UV–vis spectrophotometer. For this purpose, a suitable volume of the diluted sample extract was positioned to the sampling path of the instrument, and detected at 304 nm by spectrophotometer. The net signal difference between sample and blank signals was used as analytical signal. The spiked patulin standard solutions in the calibration range were processed in the same way for calibration where the known standard solutions of patulin were externally spiked to sample extracts before the extractive preconcentration."
9,The method validation,"2.8 The method validation Due to lack of a suitable certified sample for detection of patulin in the selected sample matrix, the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) steps were performed to test the reliability of the measurement results in terms of validity of the method. All individual uncertainty sources were estimated based on the Ishikawa diagram (Konieczka and Namieśnik, 2010). The uncertainty of the results was determined according to Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM) (ISO and OIML, 1995). The expanded uncertainty was calculated using the following equation (Borecka et al., 2013). (1) U = k u r ( s a m p l e ) 2 + u r ( c a l ) 2 + u r ( t r u e ) 2 + u r ( r e p ) 2 + u r ( L O D ) 2 x 100 (2) u r ( L O D ) = L O D c d e t (3) u r ( c a l ) = S D x y b . X s a m p l e 1 p + 1 m + x s a m p l e - x m 2 ∑ x = 1 n x i - x n The explanation of symbols contained in the above equation were shown as follows: U was the expanded uncertainty, k was the coverage factor (95% confidence limit, k was 2), ur(sample) was the uncertainty associated with amount of the sample, ur(cal) was the relative uncertainty associated with calibration curve, ur(true) was the uncertainty associated with recovery of the complex, ur(rep) is the uncertainty of precision, ur(LOD) was the uncertainty associated with determination of LOD, cdet was the amount of patulin, SDxy was the standard deviation. p was the number of repetitions, m was the total of standard samples used for plotting the calibration curve, Xsample is the amount of sample, Xm is the average of all the amounts of a model solution, Xi was the amount of model solution and b was the slope of the calibration graph."
10,Results and discussion,"When developing a new spectrophotometric method, at initial it is necessary to determine the measurement wavelength because it directly affects the selectivity and sensitivity of the method. Therefore, studies were conducted at wavelength ranges ranging from 250 nm to 500 nm to determine the measurement wavelength. First of all, a serial spectral scans for patulin at pH 8.0 were made in presence of extracting solvent, DES with and without patulin at concentration levels of 10, 50 and 100 μg L−1. From the studies, a characteristic absorption of patulin in absence of Mg(II) and DES-5 was obtained at 280 nm with a shoulder of low sensitivity at 301 nm. In other studies, Mg(II) solution at fixed concentration of 75 μmol L−1 was added to the aqueous solution to form a pH dependent extractable chelate complex or nucleophilic addition adduct with patulin via hemiacetal functional groups, the C-6 and C-2 of its unsaturated heterocyclic lactone, including donor heterocyclic oxygen, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, because of electrophilic property. From preliminary experiments, a good absorption peak, which is linearly in relation with increasing patulin concentrations was observed at 304 nm with red shift of 24 nm, so as to give a complex formation between patulin and Mg(II) in presence of nucleophilic tris buffer at pH 8.0. Moreover, it was observed that the absorbance increased in parallel with increasing patulin concentrations in this wavelength. These findings as a result of concentration dependent absorbance increase at 304 nm are also supported with results of other studies in literature where absorption wavelengths of adducts of patulin in presence of thiol containing nucleophiles such as glutathione (GSH) and l-cysteine are ranging from 301 nm to 337 nm (Tannous et al., 2017) Therefore, it was adopted as the working wavelength of 304 nm to achieve high sensitivity and good reproducible/stable results. The detailed results were displayed in Figs. 1 (a)."
11,Optimization of the DES based UA-ELPME procedure,"3.1 Optimization of the DES based UA-ELPME procedure To choose the optimal extraction conditions, each variable for triplicate measurements of 100 μg L−1 patulin was investigated and evaluated by recovery studies. Furthermore, the recovery % of patulin was calculated according to Eqs. (1), (4) Recovery %= C x - C y C x where C x and C y are the amounts of patulin in aqueous phase before and after the DESs-UA-ELPME procedure, respectively. 3.1.1 Effect of pH The primary goal of our study was to obtain an extractable complex depending on patulin concentration. The pH directly affects the structure of the chemical species. Therefore, complexation may increase or decrease depending on the pH of the medium. This can affect all the experimental steps if an extractable stable complex cannot be obtained. For all these reasons, the effect of pH on the complex formation and recovery was investigated in the pH range 3–10 using different buffer solutions (citrate, phthalate, Britton–Robinson and Tris buffers). As can be seen from Fig. 1(b), the recovery at low pH values was very low, the main reason for this is the further protonation of patulin in the acidic region (<pH 5.0), decrease in complex formation as a result of electrostatic repulsions between Mg2+ ions and the protonated functional donor groups on lactone structure. In addition, in basic regions (>pH 8.5), the recovery was reduced because the formation of the complex between patulin and Mg(II) was insufficient due to the formation of undissolved Mg(OH)2 and degradation of patulin with increasing pH. Consequently, the pH of the samples solution was adjusted to 8.0 with optimal 1.2 mL of 0.1 mol L−1 Tris buffer (in range of 0.2–2.0 mL) as nucleophilic metal chelating buffer to provide high separation and effective extraction, due to a stable and selective complex addition adduct(s) formation in presence of Mg(II) (Guo et al., 2018). 3.1.2 Effect of metal type and concentration A series of metal ions (Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II), Mn(II), Cu(II), Fe(II) and Sn(II)) in presence of tris buffer at pH 8.0 were tested for the creation of the extractable patulin-metal complexes. As a result of the conducted studies, the most effective complex formation was patulin-Mg (83.2%) > patulin-Fe (67.9%) > patulin-Mn (61.3%) > patulin-Ca (56.3%) > patulin-Zn (48.5%) > patulin-Cu (42.7%)> patulin-Sn (30.4%) depending on the recovery values. In the studies, all metal ions were used at equal concentrations. After Mg(II) was selected for complex formation or nucleophilic addition adduct with patulin, the effect of concentration of this metal ion on the recovery of the patulin-Mg was investigated in the range of 5–250 μmol L−1. As shown in Figs. 1(c), the best recovery were achieved at 75 μmol L-1 of Mg(II). Quantitative recovery was not achieved in lower concentrations than 75 μmol L−1, because the Mg(II) amount for complexation was insufficient. Consequently, a 75 μmol L-1 of Mg(II) solution was optimally used in all of the subsequent studies. 3.1.3 Selection of alcohol-based DES type The choice of the alcohol-based DES was a preliminary parameter for the extraction of the generated complex from the sample solution. Therefore, seven alcohol-based DESs (DES-1, DES-2, DES-3, DES-4, DES-5, DES-6 and DES-7) were prepared, with differing mixing ratios of different alcohols to ChCl, TBACl and TOACl. Each DES solution was applied to the extraction of the complex from the sample solution with three replicates. Equal volume (300 μL) of DESs solution was also added to each sample solution. As a result of the studies, the best recovery was obtained as DES-5 > DES-1 > DES-7 > DES-2 > DES-4 > DES-3 > DES-6, respectively. The DESs contents and molar ratios were given in detail in Table 1. 3.1.4 Effect of molar ratio of HBAs to HBD After determining the appropriate DES solution (DES-5), the appropriate mole ratio of the chemical species (TBACl as HAs and 2,3-butanediol as HBD) should be determined. Different mol ratios of TBACl and 2,3-butanediol were investigated for the extraction of the complex from the samples solution. As shown in Figs. 1(d), the recoveries of the complex were dramatically increased with decreasing TBACl and 2,3-butanediol ratio from 2:1 to 1:3 mol ratios due to the decrease in viscosity. Then, the recovery of the complex was obviously decreased from 1:3 to 1:5 mol ratios due to the decrease in the TBACl amount, which decreased the interactions between the complex and chloride anion. Therefore, the mole ratio of TBACl and 2,3-butanediol (1:3) was optimally chosen to ensure effective separation of the complex. 3.1.5 Effect of alcohol-based DES volume The lowest volume of DES-5 required for effective phase separation of the complex should be determined. If the excessive DES-5 was used, an additional dilution step was required since it would increase the volume of DES-5 in the supernatant phase prior to analysis. For these reasons, the effect of DES-5 vol on recovery of the complex was investigated in the range of 100–1000 μL. It is seen (Figs. 1(e)) that the recovery of the complex increases in proportion to the increase of the DES-5 vol from 100 to 500 μL, while there was no significant change in recovery of the complex at higher DES-5 vols. Consequently, 500 μL of DES-5 solution was used as the optimum volume in subsequent studies. 3.1.6 Effect of emulsifier solvent An aprotic solvent (as emulsifier agent) does not contain OH or NH bonds. This means that the aprotic solvent cannot form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, but can accept H-bonds from other molecules. These solvents were generally used for the self-aggregation of DES molecules in the aqueous phase. As a result, these aggregates become insoluble in the aqueous phase and separated as an immiscible liquid. The experiments were carried out in range of 50–500 μL for different aprotic solvents such as THF, acetone, acetonitrile, and dimethylformamide (DMF). As can be seen from the results in Fig. 1(f), the best recovery of the complex was obtained when 250 μL of acetone was used. Consequently, 250 μL of acetone was used as the optimum emulsifier solvent volume in subsequent studies. 3.1.7 Effect of temperature After completing the optimization of chemical reagents, sonication time and temperature studies were performed in ultrasonic bath to accelerate the mass transfer of the complex to the DES phase. The effect of temperature on the recovery of the complex was investigated in the temperature range from room temperature to 80 °C. Fig. 1(g) shows that increasing the temperature of the solution medium does not significantly affect the recovery of the complex with slight decrease up to 40 °C, but there is a significant decrease in recovery in higher temperatures than 40 °C. So, room temperature was concluded to be optimal for quantitative recovery in subsequent studies. 3.1.8 Effect of sonication time The ultrasonic effect provides rapid clouding of the DESs and, as a result, phase separation is facilitated. Therefore, the effect of sonication time on the recovery of the complex was investigated at a time interval ranging from 1 min to 20 min. The results were given in Figs. 1(h). It was observed that the recovery of the complex linearly increased up to a sonication time of 12 min, and accessed to a plateau with a slight reduction in longer periods of time. So, a sonication time of 12 min was found to be enough for quantitative recovery in subsequent studies."
12,The analytical figures of merit of the method,"3.2 The analytical figures of merit of the method The critical analytical parameters of the method were determined under the optimum conditions. These critical factors include linear regression equation, linearity, detection limit (LOD), sensitivity enhancement factor (EF), repeatability, reproducibility, and recovery. These parameters were obtained as a result of the implementation of the following experimental design. Firstly, the studies were performed on matrix-matched calibration solutions. Different amounts of standard patulin solution were added to 3 mL of the prepared sample solutions before preconcentration, and then the recommended method was applied. The analytical parameters were calculated by using absorbance values obtained from studies. The linear regression equation obtained for the proposed method was Abs = 2.85 × 10−3Cpatulin + 9.0 × 10−4 with satisfactory regression coefficient (r2: 0.9941). The linear working range of the method ranges from 7.5 to 420 μg L−1. The LOD, which is based on three times the standard deviations of the replicate measurements of the blank solution (3σ), without analyte were found as 2.2 μg L−1. The sensitivity enhancement factor (EF), which is defined as the ratio of the slopes of the calibration curves obtained before and after the DESs-UA-ELPME, was calculated as 88. The good recoveries were observed in range of 90.2% to 106.9% for five replicate measurements of patulin spiked at 50 and 200 μg L−1. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for repeatability and reproducibility as a measure of intra-day and inter-day precision were lower than 4.2%."
13,The matrix effect,"3.3 The matrix effect Patulin is a heterocyclic lactone with low volatility. It is resistant to heat and quite stable in aqueous media at 105–125 °C in the pH range from 3.5 to 5.5. However, it is much less stable in lower and higher pHs (Silva et al., 2007). In this sense, the method selectivity in presence of the matrix components is one of the most important factors affecting the detection sensitivity of the analyte and reliability of the results. In order to increase the selectivity of a method, it is very important to apply the analyte-specific soft sample preparation/extraction steps before analysis. For this purpose, the selectivity of the method was investigated by recovery of patulin at fixed concentration in the presence of different interference species. The tolerance limit and recovery values for each interfering species were determined in the study. Also, the patulin-like chemical species were selected. A change on the recovery higher than ±5.0% at three replicate measurements of 50 μg L−1 patulin was considered as interference ion. When the results in Table 2 were examined, it can be concluded that the alcohol-based DES has an excellent selectivity for the extraction of patulin in presence of Mg(II) and nucleophilic chelating tris buffer at pH 8.0 under the selected conditions. This selectivity may be due to strong interactions (like hydrophobic and intermolecular H-bond) between the complex or addition adduct(s) and other solvent/reagents present in extraction process by donor-acceptor mechanism, so as to protect the complex and/or analyte in absence of Mg(II) ions from further reactions."
14,The method validation,"3.4 The method validation From replicate analysis of quality control samples based on expanded uncertainty after spiking with 10, 50 and 200 μg L−1, the results obtained were statistically represented in Table 3 . The precision of the method was tested with intra-day and inter-day studies. In addition, recovery of the samples spiked with 10, 100 and 300 μg L−1 was found with standard addition and the accuracy of the method was tested. All the results were presented in Table 4 . The validation parameters were assessed by five replicate measurements of patulin samples spiked at low, middle and high quantification amounts on the same day (intra-day) and four different validation days (inter-day). Accuracy and precision were defined as relative error (RE%) and relative standard deviation (RSD%), respectively. The results showed that the RE% and RSD% were in range of -1.96-4.13% and 3.62–5.21%, respectively. Also, the recovery values of patulin were quantitative. Thus, the recommended method was suitable for analyzing toxic patulin levels in fruit juices."
15,Samples analysis,"3.5 Samples analysis After the optimization and validation studies were completed, the method was applied to the determination of patulin in fruit juices. The patulin levels of samples were calculated from the linear regression equation based on the matrix matched calibration curves going through the proposed method. The RSDs% and the recoveries for the spiked samples were listed in Table 5 . The recovery and RSDs% were calculated for each spiked sample and ranged from 90.2% to 106.9% and from 1.8% to 4.2%, respectively. The amounts of patulin in all fruit juice samples were ranged from 9.2 to 139.7 μg L−1 without spiking. The high patulin levels in some fruit juice (apple juice, apricot juice and mango juice) may depend on pesticides, storage conditions, and poor agricultural and manufacturing practices."
16,Method comparison,"3.6 Method comparison It was necessary to express the positive aspects that the method provided to the literature. Therefore, the analytical parameters of the method were compared with those of some methods reported for the extraction of patulin in literature. The results were given in Table 6 . The advantages of the method can be shortly summarized as follows: (i) It is simple and fast. (ii) It has a high selectivity and low LOD. (iii) There is no need to use expensive equipment and chemicals. (iv) The method exhibits short extraction time and wide linear working range. (v) The method has low consumption of reagents and minimum waste production."
17,Conclusions,"In the present study, a new, simple and green UA-ELPME using alcohol-based DES was developed for the extraction of patulin from fruit juices. The use of alcohol-based DES instead of conventional solvents has greatly improved the main parameters of microextraction procedure such as simplicity, quick, low cost and environmental safety. Moreover, the mixture of TBACl as HBA and 2,3-butanediol as HBD leads to preparation of hydrophobic DES via strong π–π interaction and hydrogen binding capacity with the target analyte. The DES based UA-LPME in combination with spectrophotometry provided wide linearity, low detection, good precision and recoveries. The proposed method was successfully applied to determine patulin in selected fruit juices, and levels of patulin detected in samples were in range of 9.2–139.7 μg L−1. When considered a maximum permitted limits of 10 and 50 μg L−1, respectively, according to the EU; it is clear that it will pose a threat in infants and children often periodically consumed these beverages in terms of food safety. Therefore, the DES-UA-LPME procedure is suitable for the analysis of patulin in fruit juices, and can be reliably used in analysis and quality control of the unprocessed- and processed-food and beverages. There is no doubt that the application of green DES solvents in food and environmental analysis will increase in the near future."
