0,Introduction,"Recently, the number of reports on reductive conversion of organic compounds by using photogenerated electrons has been increasing [1–5]. The most popular application of photocatalytic reduction is conversion of nitrobenzenes to aminobenzenes [6–17]. Our research group has explored photocatalytic reductions other than nitrobenzene reductions and has reported 1) deoxygenation of epoxides [18] and sulfoxides [19], 2) conversion of aldehydes to alcohols [20,21], and 3) hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds [22,23] and carbon-nitrogen bonds [24]. Since a reduction reaction occurs on a co-catalyst loaded on TiO2, a suitable co-catalyst is different depending on the substrate to be reduced (hydrogenated). For example, a copper co-catalyst works effectively for semihydrogenation of alkynes [25,26] and palladium (Pd) acts as co-catalyst for hydrogenation of benzonitrile to benzyl amine [24]. In other words, co-catalyst widens the possibility of photocatalytic reduction. In addition, various alcohols and organic acids can be used as electron donors. This means that hydrogenation of various compounds can be achieved without the use of hydrogen gas (H2), which makes it possible to perform hydrogenation safely. Very recently, we succeeded in H2-free ring hydrogenation of benzoic acid (BA), i.e., conversion of BA to cyclohexane carboxylic acid in an aqueous suspension of a rhodium (Rh) co-catalyst loaded on a titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2) photocatalyst in the presence of oxalic acid as the hole scavenger (electron donor) [27]. Our results indicate that aromatics can also be regarded as target compounds for photocatalytic hydrogenation without the use of H2. It is scientifically important to make the expandability clear. Among the various aromatics, we have been interested in phenols as the next target in the photocatalytic ring hydrogenation under an H2-free condition. Catalytic ring hydrogenation of phenol is carried out in the chemical industry to produce cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, which are very important compounds as intermediates for fabricating nylon 6,6 and nylon 6. Ring hydrogenation of phenol has been performed over various metal catalysts such as Rh, Pd and platinum (Pt) under a high pressure of H2 at an elevated temperature [28–32]. Recently, it has been reported that some catalysts work under an ambient pressure of H2 at room temperature; however, the active catalysts do not produce fully hydrogenated cyclohexanol and an H2-free process is preferable from the viewpoint of green chemistry [33]. In this study, we examined H2-free ring hydrogenation of phenol in suspensions of metal-loaded TiO2 photocatalysts, and we report here (1) the effects of co-catalysts and reaction conditions on the phenol hydrogenation and (2) the expandability and results of a mechanistic study to understand this reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of TiO2 having co-catalyst,"2.1 Preparation of TiO2 having co-catalyst Ishihara ST-01 was used as TiO2 photocatalyst. Loading of co-catalysts (Cu, Ag, Au, Ru, Ir, Pd, Pt, Rh) on TiO2 was performed with the photodeposition method reported previously [23,27]. Details of the photodeposition were described in supplementary information."
3,Photocatalytic ring hydrogenation over TiO2 having co-catalyst,"2.2 Photocatalytic ring hydrogenation over TiO2 having co-catalyst Photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of phenol in water over TiO2 having co-catalyst was carried out in a similar way reported previously [23,27]. Details of the photocatalytic reaction and product analysis were described in supplementary information."

5,Action spectrum,"2.4 Action spectrum Action spectrum in photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of phenol was determined based on the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) recorded on a multi-wavelength irradiation monochromator (MM-3, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). Details of the methods of experimental procedure and calculation were described in supplementary information."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of metal co-catalysts on hydrogenation of phenol,"3.1 Effect of metal co-catalysts on hydrogenation of phenol Fig. 1 shows the effects of co-catalysts (1 wt%) on the yields of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol formed in the ring hydrogenation of phenol over TiO2 having co-catalyst. No ring hydrogenation of phenol occurred over bare TiO2 and the color of TiO2 changed from white to blue just after photoirradiation (Fig. S1). The color change shows that Ti4+ in TiO2 was reduced to Ti3+ by photogenerated electrons. No products were formed when Au-, Ag-, Cu-, Ru- and Ir-loaded TiO2 samples were used. These results indicate that bare TiO2 and these metal-loaded TiO2 samples were inactive for ring hydrogenation of phenol. In contrast to these samples, Pd-, Pt- and Rh-loaded TiO2 samples were active for hydrogenation of phenol and yielded hydrogenated products, i.e., cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. Rh-TiO2 showed much larger yields of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol."
8,Ring hydrogenation of phenol in an aqueous suspension of Rh-TiO2,"3.2 Ring hydrogenation of phenol in an aqueous suspension of Rh-TiO2 Since Rh exhibited an extraordinary co-catalyst effect on ring hydrogenation of phenol, Rh-TiO2 samples having various Rh contents were prepared and characterized. X-ray diffraction patterns of Rh-TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. S2. Peaks assignable to anatase-type TiO2 were observed, while peaks due to rutile phase were not detected. With an increase in Rh loading, the peak due to Rh metal (41.1 °) gradually increased. Fig. S3 shows a TEM image (a), an HAADF-STEM-EDX image (b), EDX line scans (c) and EDX mapping images (d: Rh-L, e: Ti-K and f: reconstructed overlay image) of an Rh-TiO2 sample. These results indicate successful loading of Rh nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface. These Rh-TiO2 samples having various Rh contents were used for ring hydrogenation of phenol and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . With an increase in the amount of Rh up to 6 wt%, the yield of cyclohexanone decreased, whereas the yield of cyclohexanol increased. Cyclohexanol is formed by hydrogenation of cyclohexanone as discussed later. Therefore, these results indicate that an Rh co-catalyst accelerates both ring hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone and the subsequent hydrogenation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol. Fig. 3 shows the results of ring hydrogenation of phenol over 6 wt%Rh-TiO2. Cyclohexanone was observed as the hydrogenated product just after photoirradiation. After the yield of cyclohexanone reached the maximum at 30 min, the yield gradually decreased and the yield of cyclohexanol increased at around 30 min. These behaviors of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol indicate that stepwise hydrogenations, i.e., phenol to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol, occur (discussed later). Phenol and cyclohexanone were almost completely consumed after 45 min and 60 min, respectively. After consumption of phenol and cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol was obtained in a high yield (79%). As far as we know, this is the first report on the production of cyclohexanol from phenol without the use of H2 and at room temperature. Material balance (M.B.) was calculated using Eq. (1): (1) M . B . = n ( C y c l o h e x a n o l ) + n ( C y c l o h e x a n o n e ) + n ( P h e n o l ) n 0 ( P h e n o l ) where n(phenol), n(cyclohexanone) and n(cyclohexanol) are the amounts of phenol, cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol during the photocatalytic reaction, respectively, and n0(phenol) is the amount of phenol before the photocatalytic reaction. As shown in Fig. 3, the values of MB decreased in the early stage of the reaction until 30 min and were almost constant at ca. 0.8 after 30 min. The former result suggests that another product was formed in the early stage of the reaction. However, products other than cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol were not detected in the reaction mixture, and a small amount of a water-soluble by-product(s) might have been produced. As also shown in Fig. 3, CO2 continuously evolved during photoirradaition, indicating that oxalic acid continuously worked as a hole scavenger. On the other hand, the behavior of H2 evolution was different from that of CO2 evolution; H2 evolution was negligible for 90 min, during which time hydrogenation was observed, and was then predominant after consumption of phenol and cyclohexanone. These results indicate that hydrogenation of phenol and cyclohexanone occurred before H2 formation over the Rh co-catalyst. In other words, photogenerated electrons are selectively used for hydrogenation over the Rh co-catalyst as long as phenol and cyclohexanone are present in the reaction system. The high selectivity toward hydrogenation of phenol and cyclohexanone suggests a strong interaction between Rh species and the substrates (phenol and cyclohexanone), which will be discussed in Section 3.4. We also noted an important feature of this reaction system; cyclohexanol was not consumed after complete consumption of phenol and cyclohexanone (Fig. 3). Since an excess of oxalic acid was used, the oxalic acid remaining effectively consumed positive holes and eliminated the possibility of re-oxidation of cyclohexanol. This feature is practically important because there is no need for careful observation of the reaction to avoid consumption of cyclohexanol formed."
9,Effects of reaction conditions on ring hydrogenation of phenol and expandability,"3.3 Effects of reaction conditions on ring hydrogenation of phenol and expandability Table 1 shows the effects of the hole scavenger and solvent on the ring hydrogenation of phenol over 6 wt%Rh-TiO2. First, the effect of the hole scavenger on ring hydrogenation of phenol in an aqueous solution was examined. A high yield of cyclohexanol (79%) was obtained after 60 min in water in the presence of oxalic acid (Entry 1) and the hydrogenation was completed by 120-min photoirradiation (Entry 2). Durability tests showed that 6 wt%Rh-TiO2 could be used at least three times (Entries 3 and 4). However, we noted that H2 yields gradually decreased in the second and third uses, suggesting that Rh-TiO2 was gradually deactivated. Strong adsorption of phenol is eliminated from the reason for the deactivation because the photocatalyst was washed with water and water-soluble phenol can be removed from the catalyst surface. One possibility for the deactivation is deposition of oligomerization/polymerization products. No hydrogenated products were obtained in the absence of Rh-TiO2 in the dark (Entry 6), indicating that no homogeneous thermal reaction of phenol and oxalic acid occurred. Photochemical ring hydrogenation between phenol and oxalic acid did not occur in the absence of Rh-TiO2 under light irradiation (Entry 5). We also confirmed that H2 in the gas phase did not contribute to ring hydrogenation of phenol in the presence of oxalic acid and Rh-TiO2 in the dark (Entry 21). The use of sodium oxalate instead of oxalic acid resulted in a large decrease in the reaction rate (Entry 15). This drastic change suggests that pH of the reaction medium greatly affects the catalytic performance. In the case of formic acid, a large amount of H2 evolved instead of the formation of hydrogenated compounds (Entry 14). The use alcohols (methanol and 2-propanol) as hole scavengers resulted in smaller rates of phenol conversion (Entries 12 and 13). When acetonitrile was used as the solvent, no hydrogenation of phenol occurred even in the presence of oxalic acid and a large amount of H2 evolved (Entry 20). When alcohols were used as the solvents, the alcohols simultaneously acted as hole scavengers for the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, effective hole-scavenging is expected because a large amount of the alcohol is adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. However, cyclohexanol yields in alcohols were smaller than that in water in the presence of oxalic acid (Entries 16–19). These results mean that the reaction medium is also an important factor for driving the ring hydrogenation of phenol and that an aqueous medium and oxalic acid as the hole scavenger are a suitable combination for efficient hydrogenation of phenol. Based on results of adsorption experiments, the importance of simultaneous adsorption of phenol and a hole scavenger will be discussed in Section 3.4. The expandability of ring hydrogenation over Rh-TiO2 was also examined under the best condition obtained, i.e., in water in the presence of oxalic acid. When 2-, 3- and 4-methyl phenols (cresols) were used, the corresponding methyl cyclohexanols were obtained and the reaction rates were dependent on the position of the methyl group (Entries 7–9). 3-(Trifluoromethyl)phenol and 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol were hydrogenated to the corresponding cyclohexanols in high yields (95% and > 99%) (Entries 10 and 11). The large rates of product formation and large yields of phenols having an electron-withdrawing group suggest that this reaction proceeds through a negatively charged transition state and that the electron-withdrawing group suppressed a side-reaction(s)."
10,Adsorption experiments,"3.4 Adsorption experiments Fig. 4 shows the results of some adsorption experiments to clarify the effects of hole scavengers and solvents on the photocatalytic reaction. A large amount of oxalic acid molecules was adsorbed on 6 wt%Rh-TiO2 in water in the absence of phenol (Entry C). A certain amount of phenol was adsorbed in competitive adsorption with oxalic acid in water (Entry A). The amount of phenol adsorbed on Rh-free TiO2 decreased to ca. two-thirds (Entry B), indicating that ca. one third of phenol was adsorbed on Rh metals. A large amount of oxalic acid adsorbed on the surface of Rh-TiO2 and a certain amount of phenol adsorbed on Rh metals greatly contribute to effective hole-scavenging and ring hydrogenation of phenol under light irradiation (Entry 1 in Table 1). When sodium oxalate was used instead of oxalic acid, the value of pH of the aqueous suspension increased to 7.2 and the amounts of oxalate and phenol adsorbed drastically decreased (Entry D). Entry D explains the small reaction rate of ring hydrogenation of phenol in the presence of sodium oxalate (Entry 15 in Table 1). This result also means that an acidic condition is indispensable for efficient ring hydrogenation of phenol. The adsorption behavior of phenol in non-aqueous conditions was also examined (Entries E and F). When acetonitrile was used as the solvent in the presence of oxalic acid, a large amount of oxalic acid was adsorbed; however, only a small amount of phenol was adsorbed (Entry F). A negligible reduction of phenol and a large yield of H2 (Entry 20 in Table 1) are attributed to the characteristic adsorption behaviors of oxalic acid and phenol in acetonitrile. In other words, in acetonitrile, decomposition of oxalic acid ((COOH)2 → H2 + 2CO2) only occurred on Rh metal. In methanol solvent in the absence of oxalic acid, only a small amount of phenol was adsorbed on Rh-TiO2 probably because most of the surface was covered with methanol (Entry E). The small rate of hydrogenation in methanol solvent (Entry 16 in Table 1) can be explained by the small amount of phenol adsorbed in methanol. We also confirm that phenol adsorbed onto 6 wt%Rh-TiO2 in water (Entry A) was almost quantitatively recovered by washing with methanol (Fig. S4). Table 1 and Fig. 4 indicate that most of the photocatalytic reactions were controlled by the amount of phenol adsorbed and that the adsorption of phenol was affected by the solvent and pH of the suspension."
11,Mechanistic studies,"3.5 Mechanistic studies Fig. 5 shows an action spectrum in ring hydrogenation of phenol over Rh-TiO2 together with absorption spectra of TiO2 and Rh-TiO2. AQE in ring hydrogenation of phenol showed the same tendency as that of photoabsorption of TiO2, indicating that ring hydrogenation of phenol was induced by the photoabsorption of TiO2. Fig. 5 also shows that the ring hydrogenation of phenol occurred with high efficiency of photon utilization (14% AQE at 335 nm). The time courses of phenol and products (Fig. 3) suggest that hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol proceeded via cyclohexanone. To confirm this, we examined the reactivity of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol in aqueous suspensions of 6 wt%Rh-TiO2 in the presence of oxalic acid. Fig. 6 shows the results of the reaction of cyclohexanone. Just after photoirradiation, the amount of cyclohexanone decreased, while cyclohexanol was formed. Cyclohexanone was almost completely consumed and cyclohexanol was obtained in a high yield (98%) after 15 min. Fig. 7 shows the results of the reaction of cyclohexanol, indicating that no dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohenone occurred in the presence of oxalic acid. These results (Figs. 3,6 and 7) show that hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol proceeded via cyclohexanone under the present conditions. Formation of cyclohexanone from phenol cannot be explained by a simple hydrogenation mechanism. Based on the results obtained in this study, we propose the following processes of conversion of phenol to cyclohexanone over an Rh co-catalyst (Scheme 1 ) hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexadienol and then to cyclohexenol and 2) transformation of cyclohexenol to cyclohexanone by keto-enol tautomerism. Cyclohexadienol and cyclohexenol were not detected in this study, indicating that these compounds are unstable and their transformation to cyclohexane occurs rapidly. Fig. 8 shows the expected reaction process of ring hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol over Rh-TiO2: (1) photogenerated electrons (e−) and positive holes (h+) are formed in the conduction and valence bands of TiO2 under UV light irradiation, (2) H+ is reduced by e−, resulting in the formation of an active hydrogen species over Rh particles, and oxalic acid is oxidized by h+, (3) two CC double bonds of phenol are hydrogenated and thus-formed cyclohexenol is rapidly converted to cyclohexanone, and (4) cyclohexanone is hydrogenated to cyclohexanol."
12,Conclusions,"We examined photoinduced ring hydrogenation of phenol over a metal-loaded TiO2 photocatalyst without the use of H2 gas and the effects of various parameters, including metal co-catalysts loaded on TiO2, solvents and hole scavengers, on the ring hydrogenation. The combination of an Rh co-catalyst, water and oxalic acid is suitable for ring hydrogenation of phenol. The yield of cyclohexanol increased with an increase in the Rh content, and the apparent quantum efficiency reached 14% at 335 nm over 6 wt%Rh-TiO2. Phenols having methyl and trifluoromethyl groups were converted to the corresponding cyclohexanols over the Rh-TiO2 photocatalyst. Adsorption experiments showed that the most of the photocatalytic reactions were controlled by the amount of phenol adsorbed and that the adsorption of phenol was affected by the solvent and pH of the suspension."
