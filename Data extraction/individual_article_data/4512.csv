0,Introduction,"Amongst the latest non-thermal methods of food treatment, ultrasonication has gained considerable importance in the inactivation of microorganisms (Gao, Lewis, Ashokkumar, & Hemar, 2014). It is a non-toxic and eco-friendly system used for enhancing shelf-life of fruit and vegetables in industries (De São José & Vanetti, 2012). Since cavitation is the primary mechanism of ultrasound, which is greatly depending on its frequency, attention is now focused on the application of multifrequency ultrasound as a solution to the setback encountered with the mono-frequency ultrasound. Recently, the application of multi-mode frequency ultrasound has gained interest in food preservation (Adingba, Ma, Harrington, Akomeah, & Zhou, 2020; Mustapha et al., 2020; Otu, Haonan, Cunshan, & Hongpeng, 2018). This has been attributed to the enhanced cavitation characterized by the multifrequency, which leads to the enhanced microbial inactivation. Like any other treatment method, multifrequency ultrasound has its own advantages and disadvantages to the treated food products. An enhanced and faster inactivation has been reported with the application of the multifrequency ultrasound as a postharvest treatment to tomato, cherry, Chinese cabbage, apple juice, and orange juice (Alenyorege, Ma, Ayim, Harrington, & Chen, 2018; Alenyorege, Ma, Ayim, Zhou, et al., 2018; Gabriel, 2012, 2014; Mustapha, Zhou, Sun, et al., 2019). On the other hand, some detrimental effects were observed on some physicochemical properties (texture, lycopene content and microstructural integrity) of multifrequency ultrasound treated tomato and cherry tomato (Alenyorege, Ma, Ayim, Harrington, & Chen, 2018; Mustapha, Zhou, Sun, et al., 2019). Volatile compounds are the main determinants of flavor in tomatoes and are therefore imperative for acceptance by consumers. Volatile organic compounds (VOC) play a vital role in the flavor, as they describe not only the aroma, but also adjust other discernments related to taste, like sourness or sweetness. The flavor has been the object of several studies, which is primarily the interaction of aroma and taste, in combination with other sensory responses such as texture and mouthfeel (Viljanen, Lille, Heiniö, & Buchert). The attributes of flavor are usually affected by various factors, which include fruit maturity and ripeness, postharvest handling, and storage temperature (Adingba et al., 2020; Viljanen et al., 2011; Wahia et al., 2020). Despite the increasing researches in the application of ultrasound for food treatment, they are mainly focused on the microbial effect and some physiochemical properties, with little or no concern for certain quality factors. Using the assisted and unassisted multifrequency sonication technique, this research aimed to investigate the efficacy of the treatments on concentrations and compositions of the volatile compounds and sensory attributes of a cherry tomato exposed to the washing treatment. Additionally, the relative odor contribution (ROC) and odor activity values (OAV) of aroma-active compounds (AACs) were explored."
1,Material and methods,"Cherry tomatoes (cv. Jutou, red round-like) was obtained from a local market in Zhenjiang city, China). The tomatoes were then properly sorted to have a similar weight and sizes (11–13 g per one tomato) and also to select those free from damages. They were refrigerated for 24 h (4 °C) before experiments."
2,Postharvest washing process,"2.1 Postharvest washing process Generally, for each washing treatment, cherry tomatoes (~100 g) were immersed in 1500 ml of distilled water or chemical (depending on the washing method). Samples treated in water (distilled) without any other processing were regarded as the control. A single (40 kHz) and dual-frequency (20/40 kHz) ultrasound generator (developed in Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China) were used for the ultrasound treatment (UT1 and UT2, respectively) operating at a constant power of 300 W, a temperature of 23 ± 2 °C, pulsation on and off time of 10 s each and treatment time of 10 min. The thermosonication treatment (20/40 kHz, TT) was also carried out under similar conditions except for the treatment temperature and time of 50 ± 2 °C and 6 min, respectively. As for the chemical washing (PT), peracetic acid containing 5% hydrogen peroxide (40 mg/L) was used. While the aqueous ozone washing (OT) was done with the aid of an ozone generator (JY-TL series, Xuzhou, China), set to deliver around 0.85 ± 0.2 mg/L aqueous ozone in the washing beaker. The hurdle for the combined treatments of ultrasound and chemical (UPT) or aqueous ozone (UOT) were carried out, as explained in our previous works (Mustapha et al., 2020; Mustapha et al., 2020). Each washing treatment was carried out for 10 min and at 23 ± 2 °C unless otherwise stated (Fig. 1 ). All the washing process conditions were chosen based on the optimized conditions from our previous studies (Mustapha et al., 2020; Mustapha, Zhou, Sun, et al., 2019; Mustapha, Zhou, Wahia, et al., 2019)."
3,Enzyme activities,"2.2 Enzyme activities The extract used for the activities and the analysis was obtained and carried out, as explained in the work of Mustapha, Zhou, Sun, et al. (2019). The enzyme activities were evaluated using peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) assays. Briefly, PPO assay was determined by measuring the absorbance of a prepared mixture {0.1 mL enzyme extract, 2 mL of 0.1% catechol, and 2 mL of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)} at 540 nm using a UV spectrophotometer. The POD activity was determined, on the other hand, by taking the absorbance of a mixture (0.5 mL enzyme extract, guaiacol (0.20 mol/L), 1.00 mL of phosphate citrate buffer (pH 5.0), and 0.10 mL of H2O2 (0.3% v/v)) at 470 nm. The mean of the triplicate analysis was recorded in U/g."
4,Respiration rate,"2.3 Respiration rate The respiration rate was determined as CO2 production (Wang et al., 2015). Air-tight containers containing 100 g of cherry tomatoes (treated or control samples) were held for 1 h at 20 °C, and then the CO2 concentration was evaluated with 1 mL of gas taken with a syringe from the container headspace using a gas chromatograph (GC). The CO2 concentration was calculated using the peak area obtained from a standard gas mixture of 15.0:2.5% O2:CO2. Helium was used as the carrier gas, flowing at 20 mL/min. The temperatures for the injector, oven, and thermal conductivity detector were 100, 60, and 200 °C, respectively. One milliliter of 1.0% CO2 gas was used as the calibration for the external standard (Albornoz, Cantwell, Zhang, & Beckles, 2019). Means of triplicate CO2 samples measurement were recorded (mL/kg/h)."
5,Ethylene production,"2.4 Ethylene production Similar to the respiration measurement, ethylene content was determined by putting about 100 g of treated and control samples of cherry tomato (triplicates) into glass containers covered tightly with plastic films for 1 h at 20 °C (Guo et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). Then, from each container, 1 mL head-space gas was taken and injected into the GC using a syringe. The oven, injector, and detector, were set at 90, 110, and 140 °C, respectively. One milliliter of ethylene gas (10 L/mL) was employed as an external gas standard for calibration. The results were recorded in μL/kg/h (fresh weight)."
6,Headspace-solid-phase micro extraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of volatile compounds (VC),"2.5 Headspace-solid-phase micro extraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of volatile compounds (VC) Extraction and analysis of the VC of the cherry tomato were performed as described by Viljanen et al. (2011) with modifications using HS-SPME. For the extraction procedure, a grinded sample (3 g), homogenized with 30 μL of 500 μg/L nonyl acetate (internal standard) and 2 mL of saturated sodium chloride (200 g/L) was placed in a phial (15 mL), followed by incubation and shaking (200 rpm) for 20 min at 40 °C. A fibre was inserted to the headspace for 30 min while the phial is still under incubation at 40 °C until equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the fibre was returned back to the needle and injected into the port of the GC at 250 °C for 5 min for the desorption phase of the absorbed analytes. For gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, the VC were alienated on a column of DB-WAX capillary with helium (the carrier gas [1 mL/min]). Samples were then injected into the GC column in split-less mode, with the temperature of the oven set from 35 °C for 2 min. It then followed with an escalation of temperature from 3 °C/min to 130 °C, then increased to 140 °C at 0.5 °C/min and further increased to 250 °C at 25 °C/min; then held continuously for 4 min followed by cooling to 35 °C. The mass spectra were recorded in electron ionization mode (70 eV), within 40–450 m/z. The temperature of the detector and MS ion source were respectively 230 °C and 250 °C. The identified VC were carried out by comparing their retention times and mass spectra with the database from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, 2005; V 2.0), WILEY library, and comparing fragmentation pattern of mass spectral data. For quantification of the VC, a chromatographic grade nonyl acetate was used as an internal standard without taking into consideration the response or calibration factors; therefore, the factors were all taken as 1.0 (Adingba et al., 2020). While the concentration of the VC was evaluated via Eq. (1). 1 V C ( n g g ) = p e a k a r e a r a t i o x 30 μ L ( I S D ) x 0.5 ( n g μ L ) ( I S D ) 3 g ( c h e r r y t o m a t o ) The odor activity value (OAV) for the detected and quantified individual VC was evaluated as a ratio of the calculated VC concentration to its odor thresholds as found in literature (Adingba et al., 2020). The odor thresholds are the lowest concentration of the odor of a compound that is capable of producing an olfactory sensitivity (Viljanen et al., 2011). The ratio of the individual OAV of a compound to their total OAV gives the relative odor contribution (ROC) (Adingba et al., 2020)."
7,Electronic nose (EN) analysis,"2.6 Electronic nose (EN) analysis An electric-nose (Airsense, PEN3 Analytic, Germany) was used in evaluating the influence of the various washing techniques on the sensorial qualities of the sample. EN analysis and sensor data acquisition were monitored by a personal laptop (Intel®, Core (TM) i7, X64, 2.6 GHz) with Airsense software by the manufacturer. It is equipped with ten sensors (metal oxide) of various chemical features enabling selectivity with respect to VC. They include; S1 (W1C; aromatic), S2 (W5S; broad-range), S3 (W3C; aromatic), S4 (W6S; hydrogen), S5 (W5C; arom-aliph), S6 (W1S; broad methane), S7 (W1W; sulfur-organic), S8 (W2S; broad-alcohol), S9 (W2W; sulph-chlor) and S10 (W3S; methane-aliph). A 5 mL of ground tomato from each treatment group was poured in a lidded 50 mL of the E-nose glass tube, subsequently, agitated for 30 min at 30 ± 0.5 °C for a good headspace circulation. The analysis began with the elimination of any VC in contact with the glass vessels and the sensors by purging with air, directly inside the sensor point via a Teflon tube fixed to a needle for 60 and 150 s, respectively. Finally, the sensor head was exposed to the tomato volatiles by inserting it into the glass vessel for 100 s. Based on the sensor matrices, the data were collected and processed during the E-nose analysis (Wahia et al., 2020)."
8,Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminative analysis (LDA),"2.7 Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminative analysis (LDA) The data from the E-nose analyses were further analyzed using PCA and LDA with the aid of a WINMUSTER software (Airsense analysis, Version 1.6.2.23, 2019). This was done to distinguish the variations in the different flavors’ profile of the treatments and also to reduce the dimensionality of the matrix of the data and identify the correlations with individual composition while maintaining most of the original data information (Wahia et al., 2020)."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis The results were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) of Minitab software (17, Minitab Inc.). A Tukey pairwise test (p < 0.05) was used for the comparison of the means of the data, which were given in the form of mean ± sd."
10,Result and discussion,
11,"Efficacy of the washing treatments on enzyme activity, respiration rate, and ethylene production","3.1 Efficacy of the washing treatments on enzyme activity, respiration rate, and ethylene production The effect of the various washing processes under study on microbial safety and some physicochemical qualities of cherry tomato has been reported in our previous study (Mustapha et al., 2020; Mustapha et al., 2020; Mustapha, Zhou, Sun, et al., 2019; Mustapha, Zhou, Wahia, et al., 2019). These treatments lead to a significant reduction of the pathogenic microorganisms, thereby guaranteeing the microbial safety, enhance and maintain the quality of the fruit. However, postharvest treatments have been reported to affect the metabolic activity of treated fruit and vegetables; therefore, it is necessary to determine the effect of these treatments on some metabolic activity like enzymes, respiration rate, and ethylene production. A scavenging system of reactive oxygen species such as PPO, POD, and other enzyme activity helps in the protection of plants from oxidative stress (Wang et al., 2015). The determination of the effects of the various washing methods under study on the enzyme activity of the tomato samples is therefore important. It can be depicted from Table 1 that the PPO and POD activities are higher in the treated samples than the control samples, which can be attributed to the beneficial effect of the treatment on the cherry tomatoes. Nevertheless, comparing the treated samples, the activities were greatly affected under TT, which can be related to the detrimental effect of the high temperature. Ultrasound has been stated to have a positive effect on the enzyme activity, which thereby led to their inactivation (Wang et al., 2015). Table 1 also represents the result obtained for the respiration rate and ethylene production of the cherry tomato under various washing processes. There exist no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the control and treated samples. However, reduced production was observed with the treated samples, UOT showing the least value. The reduced ethylene production might be due to the ultrasound process that reticent the enzyme activities, which are responsible for ethylene synthesis. Also, ozone has been reported to cause a high and rapidly selectivegene activation that is involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene resembling plant-pathogen interactions (Tzortzakis, Singleton, & Barnes, 2007). Also, there exists no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the respiration rate of the treated and control samples; however, the treated samples showed a lower respiration rate than the untreated samples. In addition, treatments UT1 and TT showed higher values compared to other treated groups, which can be due to the damages induced by the cavitation and high temperature during the respective treatments. Postharvest ultrasound and ozone treatments have been reported to reduce the respiration rates of fruits (Chen & Zhu, 2011; Wang et al., 2015; Ya-xia, Zuo-shan, & Xue-wen, 2007). Similarly, ozone-treated or other chemically treated fruit and vegetables individually, or in combination with other techniques reported similar trends (Kying, Ali, Alderson, & Forney, 2014; Svoboda et al., 2016; Vivek, Subbarao, & Srivastava, 2016; Wang et al., 2015). However, there exist some reports that ozonated water in combination with other treatment techniques did result in a significant effect in the reduction of ethylene production and respiration (Huyskens-keil, Hassenberg, & Herppich, 2011; Martinez-Sanchez, Allende, Cortes-Galera, & Gil, 2008; Tzortzakis et al., 2007). The differences might be due to the different processing conditions or concentrations."
12,Consequence of the treatments on the VC of the sample,"3.2 Consequence of the treatments on the VC of the sample Aroma or odor is an essential non-visual quality, which influences the acceptance of fruits and vegetables by consumers (Owusu, Ma, Wang, Afoakwah, & Amissah, 2014). The effect of these various washing treatments was further evaluated by the GC/MS for the purpose of identifying the volatile odor compound responsible for the changes in the odor of the cherry tomatoes after treatment. The tomato odor consists mostly of different aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and some other VC (Viljanen et al., 2011). The identified VC under different washing conditions is represented in Table 2 . The SPME–GC/MS method is appropriate for analyzing odor compounds of tomato due to the need for no further extraction or derivatization of analytes. However, a major disadvantage of this technique, is that different analytes can be absorbed during the various extraction phases, thereby making the used fibres in the analysis affect the array of the discovered compounds (Viljanen et al., 2011). Forty-four (44) compounds were identified as shown in Table 2, in which 32, 31, 36, 23, 30, 33, 29, and 22 were obtained in the CS, UT1, UT2, TT, UPT, UOT, OT, and PT samples, respectively. For all the treated and the control samples, ten (10) volatile compounds were detected, i.e., 1 ketones (6-methyl-5-Hepten-2-one), 2 aldehydes (hexanal and (E)-2-hexenal), 2 furans (2-methyl-Furan, and 2-pentyl-Furan), 1 alcohol (Nonanol), 3 esters (Octyl acetate, Methyl nonanoaate, and n-Nonyl acetate) and 1 aromatic hydrocarbon (Toluene). This might be due to the resistance established by these compounds to the effect of the washing process (Adingba et al., 2020). Slight variations were found in the identified compounds compared to those found in some literatures (Owusu et al., 2014; Viljanen et al., 2011). The variation might be due to differences in the varieties of tomato, postharvest processing, as well as the methodologies used for volatile analysis. Z-3-hexenal has been reported as a major odorant in fresh tomato, though, it is very unstable (Buttery, Takeoka, & Ling, 1995). In this study, Z-3-hexenal was not identified; however, its isomer, E−2-hexenal, was identified. Also, 6-methyl-5-Hepten-2-one is one of the important aroma components of tomato, though Guadagni, Buttery, and Venstrom (Guadagni, Buttery, & Venstrom, 1972), stated that it has no important effect on the aroma of tomato; however, it was considered a vital aroma compound in fresh tomato (Dirinck, Schreyen, & Schamp, 1977). In this study, the compound was greatly affected (reduced) by treatment TT and OT, and enhanced under treatment UOT. Furthermore, the concentrations and the amount of these compound detected in this study as shown in the table were found to change due to the washing processing. Comparing with the control samples, there exist no significant difference between almost all the volatiles concentrations of the various treatment except for treatment UOT. This similarity is expected, since similar samples are analyzed, and it indicated that all the treatments had closely similar effect on the VC of the sample. Nevertheless, in comparison with the control, the treatments caused an increase/decrease in the volatile concentration and the amount of the volatiles present. The highest compound concentration was n-nonyl acetate and seemed not to be affected by any of the treatment, as there exists no significant difference between them and the control samples except for UPT, which was found to be predominantly low. Hexanal, one of the important aroma components of tomato (Turza, 2009), was found to decrease in the treatments TT, OT, and PT. The nonexistence of some volatiles compounds in some treated samples such as 2-Hexenal, 2-Pentenal, (E)-, Cyclopentanol, tetradecane, and so on may probably be due to degradation of the compounds either as a result of the cavitation effect of ultrasound or chemical reactions of the treatments (Adingba et al., 2020)."
13,Effect of the different treatments on aroma-active compounds (AAC),"3.3 Effect of the different treatments on aroma-active compounds (AAC) The influence of VC on the aroma of food is best recognized with the knowledge of their odor activity values (OAV). The effect of a VC to the specific aroma depends on its concentration and the odor threshold of the compound in the food material (Adingba et al., 2020). A VC will be regarded as a great determinant to the final aroma if its odor threshold is less than its concentration (Kwaw et al., 2018). Theoretically, volatiles having high OAV values contributed significantly to the aroma profile of the cherry tomato. Nevertheless, compounds having OAV values in the ranges of 0.2–1 may also influence the aroma of the food material due to the possible interactions (synergistic) (Adingba et al., 2020). The OAV of the cherry tomato under different treatments (Table 3 ) indicated that out of the 44 identified compounds, only 1 compound, an aldehyde ((E,E)-2,4-Decadienal) could be described as aroma-active compound (AAC) because it is with OAV > 1, which indicated that it contributed greatly to the aroma profile of the tomato. Thus, it can be deduced that the variances in the composition of the VC seemed to be quantitative instead of qualitative (Liu, Qin, Song, Tao, Y., Sun, & Liu, 2015). Aldehydes have also been reported to contribute significantly to the aroma profile of some fruits and vegetables (Adingba et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the treatment with the highest OAV is UOT followed by UT1. Based on the result, it is difficult to conclude that the treatment caused the loss or the degradation of some of the volatile compounds, as it is also found on the control samples. However, UOT seems to be best treatment that retains and enhances most of the volatiles, which can be due to the beneficial efficacy of ozone on the samples. Furthermore, the effect of these two treatments (UT1 and UOT) on the relative odor contribution (ROC) to the AAC were further estimated based on their OAV, as shown in Table 4 . UOT showed the highest ROC of the (E,E)-2,4-Decadienal, with the value of 81.52% of the contribution to the aroma of the cherry tomato. This further proves the advantage of the combination of ultrasound with aqueous ozone as a postharvest washing treatment."
14,Sensorial analysis using E-nose,"3.4 Sensorial analysis using E-nose The result from the E-nose analysis (Fig. 2 ) demonstrated that all the sensors, especially S2, S6–S9, were quite profound with the sampling gas. Treatment with mono-frequency (UT1) showed higher sensitivity to S6, S7, S8, and S9, which can be attributed to the prolonged treatment time. The sensitivity of these treatments on the sensors' arrays can be attributed to the chemical modification that took place during the treatment of the samples. That is the increase in the aromatic, alkanes, and less polar compounds during the treatment. Furthermore, there exist no significant differences between the CS, OT, and PT samples for almost all the sensor arrays, which indicated that the treatments had a similar effect on the samples. Nevertheless, all the treatments showed different sensitivity to the S6 arrays of the cherry tomato. There exist a significance difference (p < 0.05) between the sensitivity of the treatment groups on the S6 arrays especially for the ultrasound treated samples (UT1, UT2 and TT). This enables the clear discrimination obtained by the PCA analysis. It has been reported that a similarity in the recognition of the sensor arrays might lead to misclassified point and poor discrimination by the PCA (Wahia et al., 2020)."
15,Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminative analysis (LDA),"3.5 Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminative analysis (LDA) The PCA was implemented to distinguish the variations in the different cherry tomato treatments' flavor profiles and establish patterns of association with individual components while retaining much of the original data information (Boateng & Yang, 2021a; Granato & Ares, 2014; Wahia et al., 2020). In Fig. 3 A–C, PC 1 accounted for 51.287%, PC 2 had 24.40%, and PC3 had 13.16%. The first 3 PC accounted for 89.38% of the dataset. According to Boateng and Yang (2021b), a cumulative PC > 85% indicates the methods' viability. Therefore, the cumulative PC (89.38%) is high enough to explain the dataset's total variance. The UPT, CS, UOT, and PT appeared on the negative side of PC1, as seen in the biplot (Fig. 3A), whereas the UT1 and UT2 and TT appeared on the positive side of PC1. This indicates that different treatments induced an apparent shift of volatile components and a common development of volatile components at various concentrations. The UPT, CS, and UOT closeness (Fig. 3A) indicates that there could be similarities amongst these samples, which corroborates the radar fingerprint (Fig. 2). The biplot (Fig. 3A–C) demonstrated that PC1 was moderately contributed by S1 (0.423) and S6 (0.429), PC2 was primarily by S3 (0.405), S4 (−0.5073), and S5 (0.588). In contrast, PC3 was contributed by S10 (0.529) based on their Eigenvectors (Table S1), and this was visualized in 3-dimension as shown in Fig. 3D. The S7 and S9, and S1 and S6 were correlated to each other (Fig. 3D and Table S2), signifying the close connection between the terpene and aromatic components among cherry tomatoes and validating their resemblances. Such distinct discrepancies can be generated by the compositions of volatile compounds between various treatments. PCA showed that the processing methods had an influence on the various flavor indexes, and it is per the fact that different treatments had a noticeable effect on the flavor intensity of cherry tomatoes. For further discrimination analysis, linear discriminative analysis (LDA) was used, as shown in Fig. 2b, representing 51.44% of the whole data set. LDA explicitly attempts to model the differences between the classes of data. Though this analysis also showed discrimination between the aromas of the samples (control and treated), there exists an overlap. This might be due to the similarity in recognition of the sensors (S7, S8, S9). This similarity and overlapping can be due to the fact that a similar sample (cherry tomato) was being analyzed, and the treatments caused a little effect on its aroma properties. Generally, it was observed that, alcohol, terpenes, and some aromatic compounds, are the core indicators of the significant sensors (S6– S9) and could be the effect of the treatments on the produced metabolites during the treatment. This discrimination is similar to what was observed during the GC/MS analysis in the section above."
16,Conclusion,"The treatments, in addition to the guaranteeing the safety and enhancement of the quality properties of the tomato, also enhanced the enzyme activities and inhibit ethylene production and respiration rate. The treatment showed a slight effect on the volatile compound of the cherry tomato when compared with the control samples. Furthermore, the results indicated that the treatment of the tomato with 20/40 kHz and aqueous ozone (0.85 ± 0.2 mg/L) for 10 min enhanced and maintained the volatile compounds. The major volatile compounds found on the cherry tomato in this study are 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, hexanal, E)-2-hexenal, 2-methyl-Furan, 2-pentyl-Furan, nonanol, octyl acetate, methyl nonanoaate, n-nonyl acetate, and toluene). From the E-nose analysis, alcohol, terpenes, and some aromatic compounds, are the core indicators of the significant sensors. PCA showed that the processing methods had an influence on the various flavor indexes, and it is per the fact that different treatments had a noticeable effect on the flavor intensity of cherry tomatoes. The result obtained in this study further verified the application of these washing treatments as postharvest techniques for preserving the quality of cherry tomatoes."
