0,Introduction,"Today, plastic is considered the most widely used polymers in our daily life which offers a broad range of functionalities optimized for each type of application from simple packing materials to complex engineering components (Philp, Bartsev, Ritchie, Baucher, & Guy, 2013). This is mainly due to its low price, lightness, strength, stability, flexibility, impermeability, and durability (Siracusa, Rocculi, Romani, & Rosa, 2008). However, the non-degradable nature of plastic leads to generate extensive volumes of post-consumer waste over the years and serious environmental issues (Hosseini, Rezaei, Zandi, & Farahmandghavi, 2015). Annually, more than 350 million tons of plastics are produced in the world (Haghighi et al., 2020). It is estimated that 85% of trash in the oceans is made of plastics and most of them are disposable items. According to a report from World Economic Forum in partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, there will be more plastic material than fish in terms of weight in the world's oceans by 2050 (Elias, 2017). Therefore, significant research has been proposed concerning the utilization of biopolymers as an alternative for partial replacement of conventional plastics (Abdul Khalil et al., 2016; Brinchi, Cotana, Fortunati, & Kenny, 2013; De Leo et al., 2018; La China, Zanichelli, De Vero, & Gullo, 2018). In this sense, gelatin (GL) has been widely used for the development of biodegradable packaging thanks to its abundance, availability, and low cost (Etxabide, Uranga, Guerrero, & de la Caba, 2017). GL is a natural water-soluble protein, obtainable from the partial hydrolysis of collagen which is one of the most abundant proteins present in the skin, bone, and connective tissue of both land and marine animals (Chang, Chen, Lin, & Chen, 2012). GL films have good barriers to oxygen, light, UV rays and can prevent photo-oxidation and lipid oxidation, thus allowing food quality preservation and shelf life (Rezaee, Askari, EmamDjomeh, & Salami, 2018). However, films made from GL have poor mechanical, thermal, and water barrier properties leading to a shorter food shelf life compared to conventional plastic materials (George & Siddaramaiah, 2012; Haghighi, Biard, et al., 2019). Blending GL with synthetic but biodegradable polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is purposed as a simple and effective way to overcome these limitations and to reduce the cost as well (Mendieta-Taboada, Sobral, Carvalho, & Habitante, 2008). PVA is a synthetic, non-toxic, water-soluble polymer, commercially obtainable from hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate (Shahbazi, Rajabzadeh, Rafe, Ettelaie, & Ahmadi, 2016). PVA has been evaluated for safety by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2003 (WHO, 2004) and it has also been approved for packaging meat and poultry products by the USDA (Bellelli, Licciardello, Pulvirenti, & Fava, 2018; Kanatt, Rao, Chawla, & Sharma, 2012). Despite its synthetic character, this polymer is biodegradable, and it shows high tensile strength, flexibility, and gas barrier properties (Aloui et al., 2016). The GL and PVA are highly miscible and compatible due to the presence of multifunctional groups in their polymer backbone. Films based on GL/PVA blend have been extensively studied as potential biodegradable packaging materials (Bergo, Moraes, & Sobral, 2012; Carvalho et al., 2009; Kanatt, Jethwa, Sawant, & Chawla, 2017; Kariminejad et al., 2018; Mendieta-Taboada et al., 2008; Pawde & Deshmukh, 2008). However, the hydrophilic nature of GL and PVA leads to the formation of films with poor water vapor permeability and high sensitivity to water (Cazón, Velazquez, & Velazquez, 2019). This represents a major limitation for their industrial applications when applied to high moisture food products because these films may dissolve, swell or disintegrate upon contact with water (Gómez-Guillén et al., 2009; Suderman, Isa, & Sarbon, 2018). Recently, reinforcement of the polymer matrix with nanomaterials (i.e., bio-nanocomposites) has been proposed as a promising approach to optimizing the functional properties of packaging materials (Arfat, Ahmed, Hiremath, Auras, & Joseph, 2017). Uniform dispersion of nanomaterial leads to a very large interfacial and surface area (Dufresne, 2006; Hosseini et al., 2015). The ability to form a dense three-dimensional nanoscale network plays a critical role in changing molecular mobility, thereby leading to reinforcement and improvement in mechanical, optical, thermal, and water barrier properties (Follain et al., 2013; George & Siddaramaiah, 2012). Among nanomaterials, cellulose nanostructures (cellulose nanocrystals - CNC and cellulose nanofibers - CNF) have been widely studied as thin-layer coatings (Li, Biagioni, Bollani, Maccagnan, & Piergiovanni, 2013) and as reinforcement agents in different biopolymers such as alginate (Abdollahi, Alboofetileh, Behrooz, Rezaei, & Miraki, 2013), chitosan (Khan et al., 2012; Pereda, Dufresne, Aranguren, & Marcovich, 2014), gelatin (Santos et al., 2014), pullulan (Trovatti et al., 2012), PVA (Asad et al., 2018; Cho & Park, 2011; Gonzalez, Ludueña, Ponce, & Alvarez, 2014; Spagnol et al., 2018), chitosan/PVA blend (Li, Chen, & Wang, 2015) and starch/PVA blend (Noshirvani, Ghanbarzadeh, Fasihi, & Almasi, 2016). In this sense, cellulose nanostructures produced from bacteria (mainly Komagataeibacter species) have advantages over plant cellulose because they are free from hemicellulose and lignin, thus, reducing purification costs and environmental concerns derived from using harsh chemicals (Azeredo, Rosa, & Mattoso, 2017; Gullo, La China, Falcone, & Giudici, 2018; Stasiak & Błaejak, 2009; Vasconcelos et al., 2017). Besides high purity, bacterial cellulose has been reported to have a high degree of polymerization, high crystallinity (70–80%), biocompatibility, high water uptake capacity (up to 100 cc/g), excellent mechanical properties (very high elastic modulus and tensile strength) and outstanding oxygen barrier properties in medium to low relative humidity conditions (<50% RH) which makes it a unique reinforcement nanomaterial in biopolymer matrix. (Gabr, Elrahman, Okubo, & Fujii, 2010; Marins et al., 2011; Wang, Chen, Wang, Gardner, & Tajvidi, 2020). Blending GL with PVA to form a composite film could combine the advantages of the base polymers into a film with higher mechanical performances compared with those of each constituent. Besides, reinforcement of the GL/PVA film matrix with bacterial cellulose nanowhiskers (BCNW) has been proposed as a promising approach to enhancing the water barrier properties and further improvement of mechanical properties of packaging materials (Wang et al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, literature about GL/PVA blend film reinforced with BCNW is not available. Therefore, the purpose of the present work was to characterize microstructural, physical, mechanical, optical and water barrier properties of GL/PVA blend films reinforced with different amounts of BCNW produced by a selected acetic acid bacterium strain for food packaging applications."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents PVA with a molecular weight of 27 kDa and 98% degree of hydrolysis was purchased from Fluka (Steinheim, Germany). GL (bloom 128–192°) was purchased from AppliChem GmbH (Darmstadt, Germany). Glycerol (≥99.5%) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Sulfuric acid (≥99.99%) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA)."
3,Bacterial strain and bacterial cellulose nanowhiskers (BCNW) production,"2.2 Bacterial strain and bacterial cellulose nanowhiskers (BCNW) production The strain K2G30 belonging to Komagataeibacter xylinus species was used to produce bacterial cellulose (Gullo et al., 2017). The strain is deposited at Unimore Microbial Culture Collection (UMCC) under the collection code UMCC 2756 and handled according to the standard procedures of the Microbial Resource Research Infrastructure-Italian Joint Research Unit (MIRRI-IT) (De Vero et al., 2019). The strain was cultivated in 1 L flasks (working volume 300 mL) using the standard Hestrin-Shramm (HS) medium (Hestrin & Schramm, 1954), inoculated with 5 wt% of preculture. The incubation was conducted at 28 °C in aerobic conditions for a total of 7 days. The obtained bacterial cellulose layers were collected washed and dried as previously described (Gullo, La China, Petroni, Di Gregorio, & Giudici, 2019). Dried bacterial cellulose was subjected to acid sulfuric hydrolysis (64 wt%) to break the hierarchical structure into rod-like crystalline structures called bacterial cellulose nanowhiskers (BCNW) (Vasconcelos et al., 2017). Briefly, 0.6 g of dried bacterial and 60 mL of acid solution (1:100 ratio, w/v) were mixed at 45 °C for 60 min with magnetic stirring (500 rpm). Hydrolysis was stopped by diluting with cold deionized water (15:1 ratio, v/v). The BCNW were then washed with deionized water using 3 repeated centrifuge cycles (6000 rpm for 20 min at 20 °C). The resulting suspension was ultrasonicated (180 w) by an ultrasound (Argo Lab DU45, Italy) for 3 min after each washing cycle. The BCNW suspension was dialyzed in deionized water to reach neutral pH. Finally, the BCNW powder was obtained through freeze-drying with a yield of ~70 wt%."
4,Preparation of film-forming solutions and nanocomposite films,"2.3 Preparation of film-forming solutions and nanocomposite films Preparation of films was adapted from the procedure of (Alves et al., 2011) with slight modifications. Five GL/PVA blend films reinforced with different concentrations of BCNW (1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt% of biopolymer) were analyzed. Besides, GL/PVA blend without BCNW was used as control. The GL film-forming solution (FFS) (3 wt%) was prepared by hydrating GL in distilled water for 30 min and subsequently dissolved at 55 °C for an additional 30 min. The PVA FFS (3 wt%) was prepared by dissolving PVA in distilled water at 90 °C for 30 min. Unplasticized GL and PVA films are very brittle and the resulting cast films are very difficult to peel off. The addition of a plasticizer such as glycerol improves film flexibility, through the weakening of intermolecular interactions in the polymer network, also causing a reduction in tensile strength and thermal stability. Glycerol (25 g glycerol/100 g dry polymer) was then added as into both FFSs, followed by additional stirring for 30 min. The GL/PVA blend FFS was prepared by mixing GL and PVA FFS at a 1:1 ratio. Different amounts of BCNW (1–10 wt%) were added to the GL/PVA blend. All FFSs were degasified with a vacuum pump (70 kPa) for 15 min to remove bubbles. Films were obtained by casting 20 mL FFS into Petri dishes (14.4 cm in diameter) and drying at 25 ± 2 °C in the chemical hood overnight at 45% relative humidity. The morphology and size of BCNW were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (Section 2.5)."
5,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"2.4 X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD patterns of BCNW were recorded in an X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert Pro, PANalytical, Eindhoven, Netherlands) using Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. A pure BCNW film was examined with a scanning angle of 2θ from 5 to 50 at a rate of 2.45°/min at room temperature. The crystallinity index was calculated by Eq. (1) as described by Segal, Creely, Martin, and Conrad (1959): (1) Crystallinity index (%): (Icry-Iam / Icry) × 100 Where Icry is the maximum intensity of the diffraction peak in the crystalline region at an angle of 2θ ~ 22.5°, and Iam is the minimum intensity in the amorphous region at an angle of 2θ ~ 18°."
6,Transmission electron microscopy (TEM),"2.5 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) TEM images of BCNW were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (Talos F200S G2, Thermo Scientific, Brno, Czech Republic) operating at a 200 kV acceleration voltage. A small quantity of the freeze-dried BCNW was dispersed in pure water with ultrasonication for 20 min. BCNW suspension was deposited on a formvar/carbon-coated copper (200-mesh) TEM grid. The average length and width of 100 randomly selected BCNW were measured by the ruler tool in TEM images using ImageJ software (v. 1.53a, National Institutes of Health, USA)."
7,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The surface and cross-section images of films were obtained using SEM (Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI, USA). Film samples were fixed on stainless-steel support with a double-sided conductive adhesive. The analysis was conducted in a low vacuum (80 KPa) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV."
8,Attenuated total reflection (ATR)/fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,"2.7 Attenuated total reflection (ATR)/fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy Infrared spectra of the different films were recorded in the ATR mode with a FT-IR spectrometer (type Alpha, Bruker Optik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). Spectra were collected from two different locations from the top and bottom side of the same samples in the 4000–400 cm−1 wavenumber range by accumulating 64 scans with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1."
9,Thickness and mechanical properties,"2.8 Thickness and mechanical properties Film thickness was measured with a digital micrometer (Model IP65, SAMA Tools, Viareggio, Italy) at five different positions (one at the center and four at the edges). The means of these five separate measurements were recorded. The tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (E%), and elastic modulus (EM) were determined using a dynamometer (Z1.0, Zwick/Roell, Ulm, Germany) according to ASTM standard method D882 (ASTM, 2001a). The films with known thickness were cut into rectangular strips (9.0 × 1.5 cm2). Initial grip separation and cross-head speed were set at 70 mm and 50 mm/min, respectively. Measurements were repeated 10 times from each type of film. The software TestXpert® II (V3.31) (Zwick/Roell, Ulm, Germany) was used to record the tensile strength curves. The tensile strength was calculated by dividing the maximum load to break the film by the cross-sectional area of the film and expressed in MPa. The elongation at break was calculated by dividing film elongation at rupture by the initial grip separation expressed in percentage (%). The elastic modulus was calculated from the initial slope of the stress-strain curve and expressed in MPa."
10,"UV–vis light transmittance, opacity value, and color","2.9 UV–vis light transmittance, opacity value, and color The barrier properties of films against UV and visible light were determined at the UV (200, 280, and 350 nm) and the visible (400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 nm) wavelengths. This optical characteristic was estimated by a VWR®Double Beam UV × VIS 6300 PC spectrophotometer (China) using square film samples (2 × 2 cm2). The opacity of the films was calculated by Eq. (2): (2) Opacity value = -Log T600 / x Where T600 is the fractional transmittance at 600 nm and x is the film thickness (mm). A larger opacity value represents lower film transparency. For each film, three readings were taken at different positions and average values were determined. The color of films was measured with a colorimeter (CR – 400 Minolta, Minolta Camera, Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at room temperature, with D65 illuminant and 10° observation angle. The instrument was calibrated with a white standard (L* = 99.36, a* = -0.12, b* = -0.07) before measurements. Results were expressed as L* (lightness), a* (redness/greenness) and b* (yellowness/blueness) parameters. The total color difference (ΔE*) was calculated using the following Eq. (3): (3) Δ E* = [ ( Δ L ∗ ) 2 + ( Δ a ∗ ) 2 + ( Δ b ∗ ) 2 ] where ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb* are the differences between the corresponding color parameter of the samples and that of a standard white plate used as the film background. For each film, five readings were taken at different positions and the average values were determined from the top and bottom sides."
11,Moisture content and water vapor transmission rate and water vapor permeability,"2.10 Moisture content and water vapor transmission rate and water vapor permeability Moisture content (MC) of the films (2 × 2 cm2) was determined as the percentage of weight loss upon drying to constant weight (Md) in an oven at 105 ± 2 °C and the initial weight (Mw) according to the following Eq. (4): (4) MC (%) = (Mw-Md / Mw) × 100 Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of the films was determined gravimetrically according to the ASTM E96 method (ASTM, 2001b) with some modifications. Films were sealed on top of glass test cups with an internal diameter of 10 mm and a depth of 55 mm filled with 2 g anhydrous CaCl2 (0% RH). The cups were placed in desiccators containing BaCl2 (90% RH), which were maintained in incubators at 45 °C. WVTR was determined using the weight gain of the cups and was recorded and plotted as a function of time. Cups were weighed daily for 7 days to guarantee the steady-state permeation. The slope of the mass gain versus time was obtained by linear regression (r2 ≥ 0.99). WVTR (g/day m2) and WVP (g mm/kPa day m2) were calculated according to the following Eqs. (5) and (6): (5) WVTR = ΔW /Δt × A (6) WVP = WVTR × L / ΔP Where ΔW/Δt is the weight gain as a function of time (g/day), A is the area of the exposed film surface (m2), L is the mean film thickness (mm) and ΔP is the difference of vapor pressure across the film (kPa). All measurements for MC, WVTR, and WVP were made in triplicate."
12,Statistical analysis,"2.11 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis of the data was performed through analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS statistical program (SPSS 20 for Windows, SPSS INC., IBM, New York). The experiment was performed in three replicates and the number of repeats varied from one analysis to another and was reported in each subsection. The differences between means were evaluated by Tukey's multiple range test (p < 0.05). The data were expressed as the mean ± SD (standard deviation)."
13,Results and discussion,
14,Bacterial cellulose production and characterization of bacterial cellulose nanowhisker,"3.1 Bacterial cellulose production and characterization of bacterial cellulose nanowhisker Bacterial cellulose was successfully produced in a static regime of cultivation by the strain K2G30, belonging to the species K. xylinus. This strain (originally isolated from Kombucha tea) was selected for its ability to produce bacterial cellulose from a variety of carbon sources. Previous studies showed high bacterial cellulose production yield from strain K2G30, especially growing on glucose and mannitol as carbon sources (Gullo et al., 2019; Gullo et al., 2017). In this study, the ability of K2G30 to efficiently produce bacterial cellulose was confirmed. The morphology and size of BCNW were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1 a). The TEM image showed needle shape morphology with an average length of 600 nm (ranging from 300 to 900 nm) and an average width of 30 nm (ranging from 15 to 45 nm) corresponding to an aspect ratio of 20 (Vasconcelos et al., 2017). The XRD pattern of neat BCNW film is shown in Fig. 1b and is characterized by three main peaks at 2θ = 14.19, 16.63, and 22.5° (Salari, Sowti Khiabani, Rezaei Mokarram, Ghanbarzadeh, & Samadi Kafil, 2018). Our previous studies showed that bacterial cellulose had a crystallinity index of 80% (Gullo et al., 2017). The crystallinity index of BCNW synthesized in this study was 94.7% which was greater than neat bacterial cellulose. This might be due to a reduction of the amorphous content in BCNW after sulfuric acid hydrolysis. A similar result was reported by Vasconcelos et al. (2017)."
15,Surface and cross-section morphology characterization by SEM,"3.2 Surface and cross-section morphology characterization by SEM The surface and cross-section images of films based on a GL/PVA blend as control and those reinforced with BCNW (1–10 wt%) are presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 , respectively. The surface of the control film was smooth and homogenous without pores or cracks indicating good compatibility between GL and PVA (Fig. 2a). This can be explained by a strong intermolecular association between the functional groups of GL and PVA (Ghaderi, Hosseini, Keyvani, & Gómez-Guillén, 2019). Addition of BCNW up to 7.5 wt% did not affect the surface morphology indicating a uniform distribution of BCNW in the film matrix (Fig. 2b, c, 2d, and 2e). However, a rough surface with small particles and aggregations were observed in GL/PVA/BCNW 10% (Fig. 2f). This effect is mainly due to the strong interactions between the hydroxyl groups of the BCNW at the highest loading level (10 wt%). At this condition, the nanowhisker–nanowhisker association becomes predominant over the nanowhisker–biopolymer interaction (Chang, Jian, Zheng, Yu, & Ma, 2010; El Achaby et al., 2017; Reddy & Rhim, 2014). A compact and continuous structure without irregularities such as air bubbles or pores and no evidence of phase separation can be observed in the cross-section of the control film (Fig. 3a) indicating excellent structural integrity and compatibility between GL and PVA (Ghaderi et al., 2019). The cross-section of films reinforced with BCNW up to 7.5 wt% showed a similar morphology (Fig. 3b, 3c, 3d, and 3e) suggesting a good level of miscibility between the components and homogeneous dispersion of BCNW up to 7.5 wt% (Yadav & Chiu, 2019). The film containing 10 wt% BCNW showed irregular and sponge-shape structures (Fig. 3f). This might be related to the agglomeration of BCNW in the film matrix at high concentrations mainly due to the poor interfacial bonding which resulted in disrupted structures (Ghaderi et al., 2019)."
16,Attenuated total reflection (ATR)/fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,"3.3 Attenuated total reflection (ATR)/fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy ATR/FT-IR spectroscopy was performed to characterize the structural and spectroscopic changes due to the incorporation of different amounts of BCNW into the GL/PVA film matrix by measuring the spectra in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1 at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. The spectrum of pure GL, PVA, and BCNW, respectively, are shown on top of Fig. 4 in order to separately assign their specific absorption band. Comparison with the absorption bands observed in the GL/PVA blends with different amounts of BCNW then allow to draw conclusions regarding the interaction between GL and PVA and the incorporated BCNW. These interactions can result in peak shifts and intensity changes of existing peaks in the blend (Xu, Xia, Zheng, Yuan, & Sun, 2019). The spectrum of the pure GL film (Fig. 4a) revealed the characteristic peaks at 1630 cm−1 (amide-I) (typical signal for GL coil structure), 1544 cm−1 (amide-II), 1236 cm−1 (amide III), 3292 cm−1 (amide-A), 3080 cm−1 (amide-B) and the peak doublet at about 2935/2877 cm−1 which can be assigned mainly to νas(CH2)/νs(CH2) and ν(CH) stretching vibrations. Similar results have been reported (Haghighi et al., 2019); . The spectrum of the PVA film (Fig. 4b) revealed a broad absorption band between 3000 and 3500 cm−1 centered at 3264 cm−1 which corresponds to ν(OH) stretching vibrations (Alves et al., 2011). This is mainly due to the presence of many hydroxyl groups on the PVA backbone which can form intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Mansur, Oréfice, & Mansur, 2004). The peak doublet at about 2938/2910 cm−1 can be assigned to νas(CH2)/νs(CH2) stretching vibrations. The small bands around 1720 cm−1 belong to ν(CO) stretching vibrations of residual poly(vinylacetate) (≤2%) units due to the preparation of PVA from the hydrolysis of poly(vinylacetate) (Rouhi, Razavi, & Mousavi, 2017). The peak at 1416 cm−1 belongs to the δ(CH2) bending vibration. The peak at 1237 cm−1 is due to CH2 wagging vibrations. The peak at 1142 cm−1 is assigned to a coupled ν(CC) and ν(CO) stretching vibration. This peak is related to PVA crystallinity (Castro et al., 2014). Characteristic peaks between 1089 and 1040 cm−1 belong to ν(C–O) stretching vibrations, and that at 918 cm−1 assigns to a CH2 rocking vibration (Haghighi, Leugoue et al., 2020). The spectrum of pure BCNW is reproduced in Fig. 4c. The characteristic peaks at around 3343 cm−1 (ν(O–H) stretching vibrations in different hydrogen bonding states), 2894 cm−1 (νCH2) stretching vibrations), 1640 cm−1 (δ(O–H) deformation vibration), 1427 cm−1 (δ(CH2) bending vibration), 1360 cm−1 (angular deformation of C–H bonds), 1314 cm−1 (ωs(CH2) bending vibration, assigned as a crystallinity-sensitive band of cellulose), 1162 cm−1 (νas(C–O–C stretching vibrations of β-(1 ̶ 4) glycoside bonds), 1107 cm−1 (ν(C–O) stretching vibrations). The strongest peaks across the BCNW spectrum at 1054 and 1031 cm−1 are assigned to ν(C–O) stretching vibrations of aliphatic primary and secondary alcohol of cellulose (Voronova, Surov, Guseinov, Barannikov, & Zakharov, 2015). The peak at 812 cm−1 corresponds to a symmetric vibration of C–O–S bonds associated with C–O–SO3 − groups due to sulfuric acid hydrolysis during BCNW production (Agustin et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2014). From the multiplicity of ν(O–H) absorption bands around 3350 cm−1 in the BCNW spectrum, it can be inferred that the hydroxyl groups in BCNW contribute to the formation of various kinds of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Chi & Catchmark, 2017; Vasconcelos et al., 2017). Comparison of the spectra of the GL/PVA blend film (Fig. 4d) and the pure GL film (Fig. 4a) showed, that the amide-I peak of GL shifted from 1630 cm−1–1637 cm−1 in the blend indicating the interactions between the CO groups of GL and the OH functionalities of PVA (Kariminejad et al., 2018). This change can be interpreted as a conformational change of the secondary structure of GL. The amide-II peak slightly shifts from 1543 to 1549 cm−1 in the blend and also indicates changes in hydrogen bonding. Thus, our spectroscopic data showed that GL and PVA were miscible and blending GL and PVA resulted in conformational and hydrogen bonding changes. Similar results were reported by Silva et al. (2008). The incorporation of BCNW into the GL/PVA blend caused some changes in the shape and intensity of the main peaks (Fig. 4e and 4f). These changes were minor in films containing BCNW up to 7.5 wt% (see for example Fig. 4e) (Khan et al., 2012). The GL/PVA blend film matrix containing 10 wt% BCNW (Fig. 4f) showed shifts relative to the peaks between 3500 and 3000 cm−1, 1637 cm−1, and 1549 cm−1 of GL/PVA only. Moreover, new peaks at 1054 cm−1 and 1031 cm−1, corresponding to the C–O–C pyranose ring stretching vibrations of aliphatic primary and secondary alcohols of BCNW, were observed (Huq et al., 2012). These results suggest that hydrogen bonding takes place between hydroxyl groups of BCNW and carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of the GL/PVA matrix resulting in additional conformational changes (Cazón et al., 2018)."
17,Thickness and mechanical properties,"3.4 Thickness and mechanical properties Adequate mechanical strength and extensibility are required to maintain the integrity and properties of foodstuff inside the packaging during processing, transportation, distribution, retailing, and storage. The thickness and mechanical properties including tensile strength (TS), elongation at break percentage (E%), and elastic modulus (EM) of films based on a GL/PVA blend as control and those reinforced with BCNW (1–10 wt%) are presented in Table 1 . The thickness of the investigated films varied between 42 and 48 μm. The GL/PVA blend showed the lowest thickness value while the incorporation of BCNW above 2.5% significantly increased the thickness (p < 0.05). The GL/PVA/BCNW10% film showed the highest thickness (p < 0.05) due to the increase in the solid content (Pereda et al., 2014; Reddy & Rhim, 2014). The TS increased from 21.8 MPa in the control film to 26.5 MPa by incorporation of BCNW up to 7.5 wt%. This behavior may be attributed to a strong interfacial interaction between BCNW and the GL/PVA blend film matrix (Agustin et al., 2013). A large number of hydroxyl functionalities are available on the surface of the BCNW to interact with the GL/PVA blend film matrix to form hydrogen bonds, resulting an increase in TS (Wang, Shankar, & Rhim, 2017). However, this reinforcement effect of the BCNW was reduced in GL/PVA/BCNW10%, which scored TS as low as the control film, probably due to the agglomerations of BCNW, as observed in the SEM analysis (Fig. 2f). At the highest amount of the BCNW (10 wt%), the nanowhisker– biopolymer matrix interaction may be partially replaced by the nanowhisker–nanowhisker associations with a consequent drop in TS (Khan et al., 2012). The TS for the films containing BCNW up to 7.5 wt% were comparable with those of plastic films that are used widely in the market, such as high-density polyethylene (22–31 MPa) but slightly lower than that for polypropylene (31–38 MPa). The E% also significantly increased by the addition of BCNW up to 7.5 wt%, while further incorporation of BCNW into the film network resulted in a decrease of E% which can be explained by the restrictions to the consecutive motion at the filler–biopolymer interface (Yadav & Chiu, 2019). Aloui et al. (2016) and Rescignano et al. (2014) also reported that the addition of cellulose nanomaterial up to 5 wt% to PVA film caused an increase in E%. Similar behavior was observed for EM values. The significant decline in mechanical properties of the GL/PVA/BCNW10% film is also consistent with the SEM observation that the agglomeration of BCNW resulted in disrupted cross-section morphology. Similar mechanical performances have been reported for the addition of nanocellulose to other biopolymers such as agar, starch, and PVA (Agustin et al., 2013; Aloui et al., 2016; Reddy & Rhim, 2014; Rescignano et al., 2014). In contrast to these results, Khan et al. (2012) and Pereda et al. (2014) reported that the incorporation of nanocellulose to chitosan films significantly reduced the E%. Authors concluded that the strong interactions between nanocellulose and chitosan film matrix may limit the motion of the matrix and consequently cause a decrease in E%. Overall, the literature data regarding reinforcement effect of nanocellulose on elasticity values are partially controversial and are influenced by various factors such as types and concentration of the biopolymer and nanocellulose, the degree of dispersion, and interfacial interactions (Wang et al., 2017)."
18,Color,"3.5 Color The color parameters (L*, a*, and b*) and total color difference (ΔE*) of films based on a GL/PVA blend as control and those reinforced with BCNW (1–10 wt%) are presented in Table 2 . The values inside this table can be compared with commercial food packaging material and give a hint to the producer about the visual appearance, commercial success, and acceptability of products by consumers (Luzi et al., 2017). The L* value, indicating lightness, was 99–99.2 without significant variations among treatments, showing that all films were highly clear irrespective of the incorporation of BCNW into the GL/PVA film matrix (p > 0.05). Shankar and Rhim (2016) also reported that the incorporation of cellulose nanofiber up to 10 wt% into the agar films did not significantly change the lightness. The a* value, expressing the green-red color component, was negative for all films and did not show significant changes among different treatments (p > 0.05). The b* value, measuring the blue-yellow color component, slightly increased upon the addition of BCNW (p < 0.05), reflecting a slight yellowish color in bio-nanocomposite films. ΔE* measures the overall color variation of a sample compared with a standard color. The ΔE* value varied from 0.92 in the control film to 1.6 in GL/PVA/BCNW10%. The addition of BCNW to the GL/PVA film matrix increased the ΔE* value (p < 0.05) and the observed change can be attributed to the change in the colorimetric coordinate b* and increase in film thickness upon addition of BCNW. Overall, the ΔE* value of the films under investigation was comparable with commercial plastic films (perceptibility threshold of ΔE* ̴ 1) available in the market (Thakhiew, Devahastin, & Soponronnarit, 2013). Moreover, ΔE* = 2 is the limit for the human eye perception, hence consumers shall not be able to perceive any color difference in the developed films by the naked eye (Luzi et al., 2017)."
19,"UV barrier, light transmittance, and opacity value","3.6 UV barrier, light transmittance, and opacity value UV–Vis light barrier property is one of the key features in the development of films for the packaging of specific food categories since it allows to avoid or retard the oxidation of lipids, pigments, proteins, or vitamins. This feature is directly related to the food shelf life by preventing undesirable flavors, color, odors, loss of nutrients, thus preserving organoleptic and nutritional properties of the packed food (Cazón et al., 2019). The UV–Vis light transmittance and opacity value of films based on a GL/PVA blend as control and those reinforced with BCNW (1–10 wt%) in the wavelength range between 200 and 800 are presented in Table 3 . The control film was completely transparent with transmittance between 85.3 and 90.8% in the visible wavelength range (400–800 nm). Both GL and PVA films are well known for their transparency and their blends also showed transparency mainly due to their high homogeneity and the compatibility of the components. Films containing BCNW up to 7.5 wt% also showed the same level of transparency, indicating a good dispersion of BCNW into GL/PVA blend film matrix, as observed by SEM images (Figs. 2 and 3). Light transmission was slightly reduced and ranged between 81.3 and 84.5% in the film containing 10 wt% BCNW. All films exhibited lower transmittance values at UV light (200–350 nm) than at visible light. Addition of BCNW into the GL/PVA film matrix did not affect the UV transmittance and all films showed similar values. Similar results were reported by Xu et al. (2019). Opacity value of the films was calculated by measuring transmittance at 600 nm. Incorporation of BCNW into GL/PVA blend film up to 7.5 wt% did not affect the opacity value and these films showed a high level of transparency indicating the good interfacial adhesion between the BCNW and GL/PVA film matrix suggesting that the BCNW was dispersed homogenously at the nanoscale (Aloui et al., 2016). However, a higher opacity value was observed at GL/PVA/BCNW10% (p < 0.05) mainly due to the hindrance of light passage by agglomerated BCNW particles (Reddy & Rhim, 2014). Overall, all films can be considered as highly transparent due to the opacity value lower than 2. This is important for consumer preference to see the food items inside the packaging. This result was also in accordance with L* value that showed all films were clear with L* value above 99."
20,"Moisture content, water vapor transmission rate, and water vapor permeability","3.7 Moisture content, water vapor transmission rate, and water vapor permeability The moisture content (MC), water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), and water vapor permeability (WVP) of films based on a GL/PVA blend as control and reinforced with BCNW (1–10 wt%) are presented in Table 4 . The MC values ranged from 15.5 to 18%. The control film showed higher MC values than films containing BCNW (p < 0.05) and by increasing the BCNW content, the MC value in the film was reduced (p < 0.05). This might be attributed to the high surface area of BCNW and its strong interaction with GL/PVA chains leading to lower availability of free hydroxyl groups and, consequently, a reduction in hydrophilicity and MC value (Soykeabkaew, Laosat, Ngaokla, Yodsuwan, & Tunkasiri, 2012; Yadav & Chiu, 2019). One of the main drawbacks of GL and PVA films for packaging applications is their strong hydrophilic character causing poor moisture resistance. The hydroxyl groups in the polymer backbone make them polar substances able to attract water molecules from the surrounding environment. Reducing WVTR and WVP plays an important role in increasing the shelf life of packed foodstuffs (Del Nobile, Fava, & Piergiovanni, 2002). The WVTR of the control film was 1795.7 (g/day m2). With the increase in BCNW content up to 7.5 wt%, the WVTR values decreased and reached 1403 (g/day m2), corresponding to a decrease by about 22%. This is probably due to the impermeable crystalline structure of BCNW, which results in a slower water transmission rate (Xu et al., 2019). Further addition of BCNW caused an increase of WVTR in GL/PVA/BCNW10% (p < 0.05) back to values similar to the control film. This effect can be attributed to the disrupted microstructure as it was observed in the SEM images (Fig. 3f). The WVP value of the control film was 8.7 (g mm/day kPa m2). The WVP values decreased with the increase in BCNW content up to 7.5 wt% reaching 7.5 (g mm/day kPa m2), corresponding to a decrease by about 14%. Further addition of BCNW caused a WVP increase in GL/PVA/BCNW10% (p < 0.05). Addition of BCNW is an effective way of decreasing the film sensitivity to moisture. The improvement in WVP by addition of BCNW might be attributed both to the decreased hydrophilicity, resulting in turn from the lower availability of free hydroxyl groups, and to the tortuous network formed by the homogenous dispersion of BCNW in GL/PVA film, leading to slower diffusion of water molecules (Reddy & Rhim, 2014; Singh, Gaikwad, & Lee, 2018). Moreover, BCNW is less hygroscopic than GL/PVA blend due to a higher degree of molecular order (Ghanbari, Tabarsa, Ashori, Shakeri, & Mashkour, 2018). Huq et al. (2012) reported that the addition of 5 wt% of cellulose nanocrystals into alginate-based films was effective to decrease WVP up to 31%. In contrast to these results, Wang et al. (2017) reported that addition of cellulose nanowhiskers to alginate-based films caused an increase in WVP mainly due to the stronger hydrophilic nature of the cellulose nanowhiskers compared to the polymer matrix. Overall, barrier property to water is an important feature to protect packaged products from the environment and maintain their quality for longer storage times in particular for moisture-sensitive foods. This feature is important for both fresh products such as fruits and vegetables, to avoid dehydration, and for dry foods such as bakery products (bread, biscuits, crackers, etc.) to avoid moisture uptake from the environment (Cazón, Velazquez, Ramírez, & Vázquez, 2017)."
21,Conclusion,"In this study, BCNW were synthesized from K. xylinus (strain K2G30 = UMCC 2756) using sulfuric acid hydrolysis and incorporated into GL/PVA blend to form bio-nanocomposite films. SEM images showed homogenous dispersion of BCNW in GL/PVA film matrix up to 7.5 wt% while above this concentration agglomeration of BCNW occurred. All microstructural and physical characterization analyses proved that incorporation of BCNW up to 7.5 wt% determined significant improvement in the film properties of interest for food packaging application. This concentration can be suggested as a threshold level for the incorporation of BCNW into the GL/PVA film matrix, since a significant deterioration of mechanical, optical, and water barrier properties occurred above this level, consistent with ATR/FT-IR observation highlighting band shifts and intensity changes. Total color difference of films was not detectable by the naked eye and the developed films showed high lightness and transparency values, comparable to synthetic plastic films available on the market. Overall, the present study demonstrates the reinforcement effect of BCNW on GL/PVA films and proposes such bio-nanocomposite as an effective and sustainable route to improve mechanical and water barrier properties of GL/PVA films, which are especially critical for food preservation, thereby widening the potential range of application."
