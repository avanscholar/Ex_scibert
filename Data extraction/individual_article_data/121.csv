0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting is considered as one of the promising pathways to convert solar energy for the production of clean and renewable chemical energy [1,2]. Most H2 production studies have focused on the reduction reaction, but paid less attention to the oxidation half-reaction [3,4]. Coupling oxygen evolution with the hydrogen production is the ideal reaction. However, O2 formation has rarely been reported because of the need for 4 h+ per O2 molecule and its difficult desorption. [5–8] To solve this issue, sacrificial reagents such as lactic acid (LA) are commonly employed to trap holes to improve the reaction efficiency, which however undesirably wastes the energy of holes, brings along useless oxidation products [9–11]. In this context, to construct a dual-functional photocatalytic reaction system pairing selective oxidative organic synthesis and H2 production in a cooperative manner would enable sufficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes to meet the economic and social sustainability goal. Biomass from raw materials to intermediates is the most renewable earth-abundant source, which can be used as ideal sacrificial reagents [12]. Exploiting biomass derivatives (such as alcohols, amines, and sugars) to consume holes, while leaving electrons for the proton reduction to H2, significantly contributes to affordable and renewable energy production [13]. Benzyl alcohol (BA) is important platform compound that can be derived from various biomass resources. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to either carbonyls or C–C coupled products and its derivatives is a route to produce useful value-added chemicals [14–16]. To date, most reports are primarily focused on the oxidation of BA to benzaldehyde (BAD). Recently, the progress of C−C synthesis from BA has been reported [17]. For example, the visible light-driven transformation of benzyl alcohol to C−C coupled products on zero-dimensional (0D) CdS quantum dots has been reported, however featuring a poor selectivity with mixture of hydrobenzoin, deoxybenzoin, and benzil [18]. The co-production of benzyl alcohol to its C−C coupling products (benzoin or deoxybenzoin) and hydrogen (H2) has been achieved on ZnxIn2S3+x, [19] but still suffering from the low selectivity of each C−C coupling products. Notably, the C−C coupled products from BA, such as hydrobenzoin (HB) and benzoin (BZ), can be used as versatile structural motifs in fine chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates that have a broad range of applications in chiral and synthetic chemistry [20,21]. In this work, we report Mn0.3Cd0.7S nanorods modified with synergistic dual cocatalysts CoPi and Mo2N bifunctional reaction system enabling efficient visible-light-driven H2 production and simultaneous transformation of BA to value-added C–C coupled products in one redox cycle. The results demonstrate that the CoPi can be an oxidation active site to accumulate photo-generated holes, while the Mo2N can capture and transport the photo-generated electrons and provide the active site for H2 production. Due to such synergetic effect of CoPi and Mo2N cocatalysts, the photo-induced carriers can be efficiently separated, leading to a higher performance for photocatalytic H2 production and effectively tunes the product selectivity of BA oxidation. In addition, the in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic measurements show that the Cα radical is an important intermediate for BA oxidation, proving that the C–C coupling occurs through a free radical mechanism. It is hoped that this work could open a new horizon for designing novel heterogeneous photocatalysts based cooperative photoredox systems toward simultaneous use of photogenerated electrons and holes pairs for solar-to-chemical energy conversion to value-added fuels and organic chemicals."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2), ethylenediamine (C2H4(NH2)2), cadmium acetate dehydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O), sodium phosphate monobasic ((NaH2PO4·2H2O), manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O), disodium hydrogen phosphate ((Na2HPO4·12H2O), cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), molybdenum (> 99% purity), H2O2 (> 30%), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) and chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 37.5% Pt basis) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Materials synthesis,"2.2 Materials synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of Mo2N nanoparticles (NPs) Mo2N NPs was synthesized by calcining MoO3 in NH3 atmosphere. In detail, 1 g molybdenum powder was dissolved into 15 mL of H2O2 (30%) under constant stirring. After stirring for 45 min, transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180°C for 48 h. The samples were cooled down to ambient temperature, and the precipitate was separated by filtration by washing with DI water. The as-prepared molybdenum trioxide nanowires (MoO3 NWs) were obtained after freeze-dried. The molybdenum nitride nanoparticles (Mo2N NPs) were obtained by calcining the MoO3 samples in NH3 for 6 h at 750°C. The XPS result (Fig. S1) shows that passivation layer is formed on the surface of the synthesized sample, and the surface molybdenum is mixed with Mo6+, Mo4+ and Mo3+, and the stoichiometric ratio of molybdenum to nitrogen in the samples determined by ICP-AES and elemental analysis is about 2:1 (Table S1). 2.2.2 Synthesis of Mn0.3Cd0.7S nanorods (NRs) The Mn0.3Cd0.7S NRs were prepared by a solvothermal method. Detailed preparation process was demonstrated in supporting information. 2.2.3 Preparation of Mo2N/Mn0.3Cd0.7S (Mo/MCS) composites A certain amount of the Mo2N (2 mg/mL) suspension was added to MCS aqueous suspension (2 mg/mL). The mixture was stirred vigorously for 2 h without light, washed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C to obtain aMo/MCS samples (a = 5, 7 and 10, the mass percentage of Mo2N to MCS). 2.2.4 Preparation of Mo2N/Mn0.3Cd0.7S/CoPi (Mo/MCS/Co) composites Cobalt phosphate cocatalyst was loaded on the Mo/MCS sample by photodeposition method. Typically, 40 mg 7Mo/MCS was dispersed in 50 mL 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.0), a certain amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O is added, then the composite is obtained by centrifugation and washing after stirring for 2 h under irradiation, and denoted as 7Mo/MCS/bCo (b = 1, 2 and 3, the mass percentage of CoPi to MCS). The blank CoPi and MCS/Co composite were prepared by the same procedure without adding 7Mo/MCS and replacing 7Mo/MCS with MCS."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The instrument model used for characterization was demonstrated in the support information, which was reported in our previous works [9]. Detailed experimental process was demonstrated in supporting information."
5,Photocatalytic Testing,"2.4 Photocatalytic Testing The photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production integrated with hydrobenzoin (HB) synthesis was performed in a double-walled quartz reactor and the temperature of the solution was maintained at 25 °C by a flow of circulating water. Typically, 10 mg samples were added into 10 mL of CH3CN containing 50 μL (0.48 mmol) of BA. The reaction suspension was purged with Ar gas for 30 min. A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300D, Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd.) was used as the light source (λ ≥ 420 nm), and the light power density is 300 mW cm−2 measured by a photoradiometer (PL-MW2000, Beijing Perfectlight Co.,Ltd.). The evolved H2 was quantified by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A 2014 C). The liquid products were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (Shimadzu HPLC-LC20AT), which also were monitored by gas chromatography−mass spectroscopy (Shimadzu GC−MS QP 2020, Q-Exactive)."
6,Charge Flow Tracking by Photo-deposition,"2.5 Charge Flow Tracking by Photo-deposition Photo-deposition of 1.5 wt% Pt and PbO2 on the surfaces of 7Mo/MCS/2Co was carried out using H2PtCl6 and Pb(NO3)2 as precursors, respectively, which was reported in our previous works [9]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Morphology analysis,"3.1 Morphology analysis The overall fabrication procedure for Mo2N/Mn0.3Cd0.7S/CoPi (Mo/MCS/Co) composite is schematically pictured in Fig. 1a. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows the obtained MoO3 sample (Figs. S2a and 1b) is a 1D nanowires (NWs) structure, after the NH3 reduction process, the obtained black sample is Mo2N nanoparticles (NPs) (Figs. S2b and 1c). Subsequently, the Mo2N/Mn0.3Cd0.7S (Mo/MCS) composites were prepared by electrostatic self-assembly method. The opposite charged surfaces of Mo2N and MCS (Fig. S3) result in them assemble into Mo/MCS composites driven by the forces of electrostatic attraction. Finally, the cobalt phosphate (CoPi) have been deposited on the Mo/MCS composites through a photodeposition method. Co2+ ions can be oxidized into Co3+ by photogenerated holes of MCS NRs and the Co3+ has limited solubility at aqueous buffer solution with pH = 7, cobalt phosphate (CoPi) will deposit on the surface of Mo/MCS composites [22]. To check the microscopic morphology and structure information of the dual-cocatalysts composite, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been executed. As revealed in Fig. 1e, the 7Mo/MCS/2Co composite shows 1D nanorod morphology, with Mo2N or CoPi nanoparticles dispersed on its surface. The lattice fringes with a distance of 0.295 nm matches the (211) plane of Mo2N well. The pronounced lattice spacings of 0.287 and 0.241 nm correspond to the (201) and (110) plane of hexagonal phase MCS, respectively. The lattice fringes with a distance of 0.344 nm matches the (210) plane of CoPi. These results illustrate the successful combination of MCS and Mo2N/CoPi. In addition, energy-disperse X-ray mapping (EDX-mapping) (Fig. 1f–k) show that the Mo2N and CoPi nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of MCS."
9,Structural characteristics,"3.2 Structural characteristics The crystal structures of these synthetic samples have been employed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 2a, the diffraction peaks located at 24.9°, 26.6°, 28.5°, 44.2°and 52.5° correspond to (100), (002), (101), (110) and (112) crystallographic planes of hexagonal solid solution Mn0.3Cd0.7S [9]. The diffraction peaks of CoPi are in a good agreement with those of monoclinic Co3(PO4)2·8H2O (JCPDS NO. 33-0432) [23]. The diffraction peaks located at 37.1°, 42.9°, 62.4° and 74.9° are assigned to (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystallographic planes of cubic Mo2N (JCPDF 25-1366), respectively. After loading of Mo2N or/and CoPi on Mn0.3Cd0.7S, the XRD patterns have no obvious changes for 7Mo/MCS, MCS/2Co and 7Mo/MCS/2Co. No diffraction peaks of Mo2N and CoPi are observed in these composites, and this phenomenon could be ascribed to the lower Mo2N and CoPi content. Fig. 2b shows the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) of the as-obtained samples. The absorption band edge of CoPi sample locates at around 280 nm, and the optical absorption in the range of 400–700 nm corresponds to the d-d electron transition of Co (II) [24]. The bare Mo2N presents a broad and intense absorption in the range of 250–800 nm, which is consistent with its black color [25]. The band gap of blank MCS is determined to be of 2.44 eV based on its UV–vis DRS with the Tauc plot (Fig. S4). Compared with the blank MCS NRs, a red shift of optical absorption was observed over all the 7Mo/MCS, MCS/2Co and 7Mo/MCS/2Co composites. N2 adsorption-desorption tests are conducted to gain information about surface properties of the sample. As listed in Table S2, it can be seen that compared with MCS NRs, the BET specific surface area of 7Mo/MCS, MCS/2Co and 7Mo/MCS/2Co increase from 22.99 m2 g −1 to 34.84, 33.17, and 35.02 m2 g −1, respectively. The increased surface area may offer abundant exposed catalytic-active sites and improve the photocatalytic activity. X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) provides valuable chemical composition and binding states of elements on the surface of 7Mo/MCS/2Co composite. As compared with bare MCS NRs, the peaks in both Cd 3d region (411.2 and 404.4 eV) and Mn 2p region (651.8 and 640.8 eV) shifted towards higher binding energy (Fig. 2c, d). As shown in Fig. 2f, the peak at 226.7 eV verified the formation of Mo-S bond, and the existence of Mo-S bonds facilitates the transfer of photo-generated charges [26]. Compared with Mo2N, the binding energy of Mo 3d and N 1 s of 7Mo/MCS/2Co are negatively shifted, suggesting the existence of interaction among Mo2N and MCS in the composites (Fig. 2f, g) [27]. In the case of Co 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2h), the peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 are located at 781.87 eV, 797.99 eV, 785.52 eV and 801.97 eV (satellite peaks at 788.38 eV and 805.08 eV), which proves the composition of Co2+ and Co3+ [28]. The P 2p peak at 133.1 eV (Fig. 2i) is indicative of PO4 3- in the CoPi phase [22]."
10,Photocatalytic performance,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance The dehydrogenative C−C coupling of benzyl alcohol (BA) into hydrobenzoin (HB) and H2 performance was evaluated over the as-prepared samples under visible light. It was found that the production rates of H2 and HB are calculated to be ca. 1.0, suggesting a stoichiometric dehydrogenation reaction. Only relatively low activity for converting BA to benzaldehyde (BAD) appears on MCS ( Fig. 3a). Notably, the introduction of Mo2N and CoPi onto MCS can not only improve the H2-generation rate, but also tune the selectivity for BA oxidation (Fig. S6). The as-prepared 7Mo/MCS/2Co shows an optimum performance among the investigated samples (Fig. 3a). The average H2-generation rate of 1.83 mmol g−1 h−1 was obtained after 12 h irradiation, which is around 8.71, 2.20 and 2.73 times than that of blank MCS, single cocatalyst loading MCS/2Co and 7Mo/MCS, respectively. Meanwhile, the conversion of BA improves from 6.05% to 35.78%, 29.68% and 90.20%. Specifically, over 7Mo/MCS/2Co, a HB production rate of 1.79 mmol g−1 h−1 can be obtained with a yield of 89.45% (12 h reaction time) and a high selectivity of above 98.24% (Fig. 3b-d). The wavelength-dependent HB produced from C−C coupling and AQE measurement of 7Mo/MCS/2Co composite have been performed. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for the 7Mo/MCS/2Co composite, calculated as the number of charge carriers (holes) used for the HB production divided by the number of incident photons, depends strongly on the light wavelength and well matches the DRS spectrum for the 7Mo/MCS/2Co composite, as shown in Fig. 3e. The corresponding AQE at 420 nm reached 2.71%, which is significantly higher than that of the MCS NRs, 7Mo/MCS and MCS/2Co composite. Moreover, as shown in Supplementary Table S4, it can be found that the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of 7Mo/MCS/2Co composite in BA conversion has exceeded that of most recently reported catalysts. The efficacy of the 7Mo/MCS/2Co composite was also tested for recyclability of three successive runs. No obvious loss of the activity is observed after 3 cycles over a total reaction time of 36 h (Fig. 3f), suggesting its high stability during photocatalytic H2 evolution and C−C coupling organic synthesis process. The used 7Mo/MCS/2Co sample was further examined by XRD and XPS, and the unchanged XRD pattern and XPS spectrum of the composite are observed (Fig. S7). The results indicate that the 7Mo/MCS/2Co photocatalyst possesses good structural stability in the photocatalytic system."
11,Discussion of the photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Discussion of the photocatalytic mechanism Photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were carried out over MCS, 7Mo/MCS, MCS/2Co and 7Mo/MCS/2Co. As shown in Fig. 4a, MCS NRs show the lowest photocurrent density, while the introduction of Mo2N or CoPi obviously raises the current density. In particular, when CoPi and Mo2N are loaded onto MCS NRs simultaneously, the 7Mo/MCS/2Co composite shows the highest photocurrent density. The EIS of 7Mo/MCS/2Co shows the smallest semicircles among the four investigated samples (Fig. 4b), suggesting a most effective electron-hole pairs separation and transport over 7Mo/MCS/2Co. PL spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) have also been performed. As shown in Fig. 4c, the PL emission intensity decreases in the following order: 7Mo/MCS/2Co < MCS/2Co < 7Mo/MCS < bare MCS. And the TRPL spectra (Fig. 4d and Table S3) show that 7Mo/MCS/2Co has the longest charge carrier lifetime among the four samples, indicating that charge recombination can be better suppressed after loading Mo2N and CoPi. To reveal the reaction mechanism of HB formation in the photo-redox catalytic system, we conducted a series of control experiments, as disclosed in Fig. 4e. Removing the catalyst or light irradiation, no product was detected, indicating that the reaction is a photocatalytic process. The introduction of a hole scavenger (TEOA) into the system retarded the HB and BAD formation, whereas the formation of H2 ceased after the addition of an electron scavenger (NaIO3), showing that both photogenerated electrons and holes participate in the formation of H2, BAD and HB on the 7Mo/MCS/2Co photocatalyst. In addition, BAD is always kept at a very low concentration during the reaction (Fig. S8), the production rate of HB matches the production rate of H2 very well, indicating the BAD is not an intermediate product but a by-product [16]. Furthermore, it is noted that the addition of the radical scavenger 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) also significantly inhibited the production of HB (Fig. 4e), indicating that the formation of HB is through radicals intermediates [29]. To gain more hints on radical intermediates mechanism, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique using DMPO as a spin-trapping regent is utilized to detect the carbon-centered free radicals in this reaction. Fig. 4f shows six characteristic signal peaks belonging to the DMPO-Cα radical adduct under light irradiation for both MCS and the 7Mo/MCS/2Co composite, indicating the existence of carbon-centered radical intermediate in this photocatalytic system. [30] Furthermore, a quantitative analysis has been performed to measure the hydrogen and nitrogen hyperfine plittings (αH, αN) for the nitroxide nitrogen. The result suggests αH = 21.9 and αN = 16.1, which are similar to the reported values for DMPO-CH(OH)Ph in the previous literature [14]. In addition, the signal intensities of DMPO-CH(OH)Ph radicals over the 7Mo/MCS/2Co composites are stronger than that for MCS, indicating that a larger amount of such •CH(OH)Ph radicals can be photogenerated in a 7Mo/MCS/2Co-catalyzed system, which is consistent with the photoactivity trend. Consequently, the 7Mo/MCS/2Co photocatalyst markedly favors the C−C coupling of as-obtained •CH(OH)Ph radicals. The work function (WF) of MCS and Mo2N were measured by Kelvin probe. As demonstrated in Fig. 4g, the average contact potential difference (CPD) of Mo2N and MCS are 760 and 420 mV, respectively. Accordingly, the WF of Mo2N and MCS are calculated to be 5.86 and 5.52 eV, respectively, which indicates that the Fermi level of Mo2N is more negative than that of MCS (Fig. 4h). The formation of the Schottky junction at the interface of MCS and Mo2N makes the electrons transfer from MCS to Mo2N until equilibrium is reached. And a built-in electric field, with positively charged MCS and negatively charged Mo2N, is thus formed. The value of standard potentials of E(Co3+/Co2+) and E(O2/H2O) are + 1.74 and + 1.23 V (vs NHE), respectively, indicating that it is thermodynamically favorable for the photogenerated holes to oxidize Co2+ of CoPi to Co3+, and Co3+ then oxidizes water to oxygen and returns to Co2+ [31,32]. It was further supported by the cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV of 7Mo/MCS/2Co shows two pairs of reversible redox peaks (Fig. 4i), which are assigned to the redox couple of Co3+/2+ and Co4+/3+, respectively [33,34]. In contrast, no redox peaks are observed for MCS and 7Mo/MCS. To verify the photogenerated charge transfer route, the photo-deposition of 7Mo/MCS/2Co with Pt or PbO2 probe was carried out. As shown in Fig. 5a, b, Pt particles are clearly deposited on Mo2N, while no Pt are observed on MCS or CoPi (Fig. S10), implying that the photogenerated electrons in the 7Mo/MCS/2Co sample transfer from MCS to Mo2N [9]. As shown in Fig. 5c, d, PbO2 particles deposited on CoPi, while there are no lattice fringes of PbO2 on MCS or Mo2N (Fig. S11), implying that the photogenerated holes of MCS NRs transfer to CoPi [35]. These results convincingly verify that Mo2N mainly serves as active sites of reduction while CoPi serves as the oxidation sites. Based on the results presented above, a mechanism for photocatalytic hydrogen production by water spitting over the Mo/MCS/Co composites is proposed in Fig. 5e. Under irradiation, the photoexcited electrons on the VB of MCS NRs are excited to the CB, then transferred to Mo2N through a interfacial Mo-S bond, and the protons denoted by BA are reduced to H2. In the meantime, the photoexcited holes on the VB of MCS NRs migrate to CoPi and the Co2+/3+ of CoPi is oxidized to Co4+. Then Co4+ first oxidize the C−H bond of BA, affording •CH(OH)Ph radicals and returns to Co2+/3+, which promotes the separation of photogenerated holes through the cycle of Co2+/3+→Co4+→Co2+/3+. Then, the •CH(OH)Ph radicals can either be further oxidized by holes to generate BAD or combine with another •CH(OH)Ph radical to form HB. Therefore, there is a mutual promotion between the CoPi-mediated hole transfer and the Mo2N-mediated electron transfer, greatly improving the charge separation efficiency, leading to an enhanced photoactivity and selectivity of C−C coupling products compared with MCS."
12,Conclusions,"In conclusion, a Mo2N/Mn0.3Cd0.7S/CoPi composite with spatial separation of oxidation and reduction sites was fabricated by electrostatic self-assembly and photodeposition method. The Mo2N/Mn0.3Cd0.7S/CoPi composite exhibits remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activities and selectivity of C−C coupling products than that Mn0.3Cd0.7S loaded with single cocatalyst. The excellent photocatalytic activity of Mo2N/Mn0.3Cd0.7S/CoPi composite can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the Mo2N and CoPi dual cocatalysts. In particular, the cage-like hole cocatalyst CoPi can be used as the Cα radical intermediates recognition active site to control the adsorption-desorption behavior of the substrate molecule and enhance its interaction with the photocatalyst, thereby exhibiting a superior selectivity of C−C coupling products. The interfacial Mo-S bond formed between Mo2N and MCS creates direct electron transfer channels and further improves the photocatalytic activity. This work provides a promising route to engineer efficient synergistic dual cocatalysts modified photocatalysts for visible-light-driven cooperative photoredox-catalyzed production of solar fuels and selective organic synthesis of value-added chemical feedstocks. Moreover, to advance the practical applications of such a dual-functional photocatalytic system, besides the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient photocatalysts, it is also an important direction to rationally design continuous flow photoreactor, which can not only increase the interfacial interaction between catalysts and organic substrates induced by the enhanced mass-transfer abilities, but also separate the reactants and target products in time."
