0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde is an essential intermediate and widely used in perfumes, agrochemicals, dyestuffs, and pharmaceutical industry [1–3]. Traditionally, the production of benzaldehyde includes the toluene chlorination and hydrolysis processes, which brings a large amount of hazardous and acidic wastes [4]. In accordance with sustainable development, the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with green oxidants (such as O2 and H2O2), is considered as a feasible and eco-friendly way to produce benzaldehyde. To activate O2 and improve the yield of benzaldehyde, high temperature and high pressure are usually required due to its inert triplet ground state structure. Different from O2, H2O2 is a promising alternative for the benzyl alcohol oxidation under mild conditions, it can release active oxygen species and generate water as the sole by-product during the reactions [5,6]. On the other hand, tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing heterogeneous catalysts for this transformation due to the easy recovery characteristic, but these catalysts usually suffer from several problems concerning relatively low selectivity and poor activity [7,9,10]. In addition, the aggregation of the metal nanoparticles and the leaching of metals usually occurred during the reaction process due to the weak interactions between metals and supports [11,12]. Thus, it is urgent to develop a catalyst with good activity and stability for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol under mild conditions. Supported metal/metal oxide catalysts have proved to be an effective strategy for hindering the agglomeration of metal nanoparticles during the liquid-solid phase oxidation reactions [13,14]. In heterogeneous catalysis, metal nanoparticles are usually immobilized by different supports (such as Al2O3, TiO2, MgO, silica, carbons) [15–17]. It was reported that coupling metals with the catalyst supports was able to modulate the electronic states of metal nanoparticles, thus leading to a better catalytic performance [18,19]. Among various catalyst supports, N-doped carbon has attracted widespread attention because the nitrogen species among carbon matrix can provide abundant active sites and also bring some preferable structural advantages [20]. Meanwhile, the N-doped carbon material possesses some other characteristics, such as high specific surface area, good chemical stability and low cost [21]. In this case, it is reasonable to believe that coupling metal nanoparticles with N-doped carbon could bring more probability to improve the catalytic performance for benzyl alcohol oxidation. To date, noble metals (such as Pd [22–24], Ru [3], Au [10,25]), non-noble metals/metal oxides and the composites (such as Pd/Mn5O8 [1], ZnTi-LDH [4], PW-based [6], ZnO [7], Bi2MoO6 [26], Sn-W oxide/RGO [27], Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 [28], BiFeO3/CNTs-PPy [29], Co3O4/RGON [30], Co2.91Fe0.09O4 [31]) have been extensively explored for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. For example, Hu et al. [32] prepared a series of ternary Pd/CeO2-nitrogen-doped graphene catalysts for the solvent-free aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and the composite exhibited good catalytic activity with turnover frequency (TOF) of 30.74 s−1. Wang et al. [33] reported the Au-Pd core-shell bimetallic catalysts for this transformation, and 94% conversion of benzyl alcohol and 88% selectivity of benzaldehyde were achieved over the prepared catalyst within 6 h. Though the Au- and Pd- based catalysts displayed satisfactory catalytic performance, the scarce reserve and high cost still impeded their large-scale applications. In this context, it is highly desirable to develop an efficient and cost-effective catalyst for this transformation. In this work, the N-doped carbon supported WO3 composite catalysts were prepared via a hydrothermal and subsequent calcination method and used for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with a green approach. The composite catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, N2 adsorption-desorption, TGA, and XPS, and the intrinsic correlations between catalytic behaviors and structural properties were investigated. The effects of different reaction parameters (such as reaction time, reaction temperature, H2O2 dosage and catalyst amount) were also studied. Besides, a possible reaction mechanism for the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was proposed. This work developed a green and efficient catalytic system for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol over a robust WO3/N-doped carbon composite catalyst."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Starch, melamine, urea, Na2WO4•2H2O, hydrochloric acid (37 wt.%), benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, H2O2 (30 wt.%), benzoic acid, benzyl benzoate, and ethyl acetate were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China), and all the chemicals were used as received without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Typically, 6 mmol of Na2WO4•2H2O was firstly dissolved in 60 ml of deionized water, and then 37 wt.% HCl solution was dropwise added until the pH value of the resultant mixture was 2. The mixture was kept stirring vigorously for another 3 h, and then transferred into a 100 ml of Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave to undergo a hydrothermal process at 160 °C for 15 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solid sample was collected and rinsed with deionized water thoroughly and then dried in an oven for the next use. For the preparation of WO3/N-doped carbon composites, the obtained 0.5 g of WO3 was mixed with 1 g of starch, 0.5 g of melamine and 0.5 g of urea in 50 ml of deionized water, and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 4 h. Afterwards, the temperature was increased to 90 °C to remove the excess water under continuous stirring. The resultant sample was transferred into a crucible and calcined at a given temperature (T = 400, 500, 600 and 700 °C, respectively) under N2 for 3 h with a ramping rate of 10 °C min–1, and then ground into powder. The composite catalysts were denoted as WO3/NC-x, in which x indicates the calcination temperature of samples. In addition, the bare WO3 and bare N-doped carbon were also prepared via the above process for comparison (both of the two samples were calcined at 600 °C for 3 h)."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations X-ray diffractions (XRD) patterns were measured by a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å). Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi SU-70) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, Oxford Instruments) was used to investigate the morphology and chemical composition of the catalysts. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples were dispersed in ethanol ultrasonically and then dropped onto the carbon-coated copper grids prior to the TEM observations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer by using Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV), and the binding energies were calibrated with C 1 s at 284.6 eV. N2 adsorption-desorption measurements were performed at –196 °C with a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument. Before the measurement, the catalysts were degassed under vacuum at 150 °C for 6 h, and the surface areas and pore size distributions were determined by the BET and BJH methods, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TGA/DSC 3+ apparatus (Mettler Toledo Corp., Switzerland), and the experimental temperature ranged from 50 to 800 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min–1 under air flow."
5,Catalytic activity test,"2.4 Catalytic activity test The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with H2O2 as the oxidant was used to evaluate the activity of the prepared catalysts. To accord with the development of green chemistry, no non-green basic additives and organic solvents were used in this reaction, and water was used as the solvent. In a typical experiment, 0.5 mmol of benzyl alcohol, 0.75 mmol of H2O2 (30 wt.%), 1 ml of water, and 5 mg of catalyst were added into a customized glass reactor with vigorous stirring at 80 °C for 4 h. After the reaction, the solid catalyst was recovered from the reaction mixture via simple centrifugation, and the oxidized products and reactant in the filtrate were extracted by ethyl acetate. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity of benzaldehyde were quantified by gas chromatography (Agilent 6820, FID, hp-5 column) with external standard method. The reaction products were determined by comparing the retention times of the known reference samples, and also identified by GC–MS (Agilent 6890–5973). It should be noted that the carbon balance in this reaction was calculated to be around 100%, carbon balance (%) = (moles of all the products formed)/(moles of the benzyl alcohol converted) × 100%, the products included the main product (benzaldehyde) and the by-products (benzoic acid and benzyl benzoate). Moreover, each reaction result was repeated at least three times to ensure the reproducibility of the data."
6,Results and discussion,"The crystalline structure of the prepared WO3/N-doped carbon composite catalysts was investigated by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of bare WO3 indicated that it was attributed to orthorhombic phase (JCPDS No. 20–1324). The characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ = 26° of bare N-doped carbon was observed, corresponding to the (002) plane of carbon materials [34,35]. It was interesting to find that, as regards the several WO3/NC composites, the crystalline structure of WO3 was changed from orthorhombic to hexagonal phase (JCPDS No. 33–1387) when N-doped carbon was incorporated into the composite catalysts. Such a phenomenon suggested that the addition of N-doped carbon or the calcination process could induce the phase transformation of WO3 crystals among the WO3/NC composites. In addition, when the calcination temperature was increased to 600 °C, the (201) plane of hexagonal WO3 became the dominant exposed crystal plane and other diffraction peaks conversely became inconspicuous (as for WO3/NC-600 and 700). However, no obvious XRD patterns of N-doped carbon could be found among the composites, thus, XPS and EDS were used to investigate its presence among the WO3/NC composite catalysts. The chemical composition and elemental valence states of the prepared catalysts were studied via XPS. The full XPS spectrum of WO3/NC-600 in Fig. S1 clearly showed the presence of elements C, N, O, and W, confirming the existence of N-doped carbon among the composite. Additionally, the C 1s XPS spectra of bare N-doped carbon and WO3/NC-600 in Fig. 2a could be divided into three peaks at 284.6, 285.9 and 288.3 eV, corresponding to the C–C/C=C, C–N/C–O and O–C=O groups, respectively [36,37]. It should be noted that the content of oxygen/nitrogen-containing functional groups (C–N/C–O and O–C=O) of bare N-doped carbon decreased from 42.1% to 34.9% for the WO3/NC-600 catalyst, implying that the introduction of WO3 into WO3/NC-600 composite had consumed some oxygenous and nitrogenous groups of N-doped carbon. As for WO3/NC-600 in Fig. 2b, the fitted peaks of O 1s XPS spectrum at 530.0 and 531.8 eV were respectively ascribed to W–O/C=O and C–O/N–O groups [38], and only one peak at 531.8 eV (assigned C–O/N–O groups) of N-doped carbon was observed. In Fig. 2c, N 1s XPS spectrum of N-doped carbon revealed the presence of pyridinic N (398.2 eV), pyrrolic N (399.5 eV) and graphitic N (400.5 eV) species [39,40], demonstrating that N atoms were incorporated within the carbon internal structure through the heating treatment process. It is noteworthy that the pyrrolic N and graphitic N peaks of WO3/NC-600 both exhibited a positive shift by 0.3 eV compared to those of N-doped carbon. Moreover, two obvious peaks at 37.9 and 35.8 eV in Fig. 2d were assigned to the characteristic W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 of W6+, respectively [41,42], and the doublet peaks of WO3/NC-600 shifted to the lower binding energies compared to those of bare WO3. Combined with the positive shift of N 1s peaks, such results revealed the existence of electron transfer between N-doped carbon and WO3 among the composite, and the electronic interaction between the two components probably gave a reasonable explanation for its robust stability during the recycle experiments. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. It was found that the samples both displayed type IV isotherms with an obvious hysteresis loop (caused by capillary condensation of N2), indicating the existence of mesopores among the prepared catalysts [43]. It could be found from the pore size distribution curves that coupling WO3 and N-doped carbon led to some small mesopores (at around 2 nm), which might result from the intra-particles voids of WO3 nanoparticles on N-doped carbon among the composite [30]. In addition, the specific surface areas were calculated to be 44.5 m2 g–1 for WO3 and 63.1 m2 g–1 for WO3/NC-600 composite, respectively. Similar trend with the pore volume was also observed, and the WO3/NC-600 composite exhibited a larger pore volume (0.117 vs. 0.104 cm3 g–1). The higher specific surface area and larger pore volume could provide more exposed active sites, benefitting to achieve better catalytic activity. Furthermore, the morphological structure of the prepared catalysts was also investigated by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 4a and d, the bare WO3 displayed a typical rectangular nanoplates with an average size of 200 nm, and the WO3 nanoparticles would aggregate into large clusters inevitably due to the high surface energy. As for bare N-doped carbon, the wrinkled and laminar graphitic nanosheets with numerous pores and cavities were observed in Fig. 4b and e, providing abundant sites for the distribution of WO3 nanoparticles on its surface. In Fig. 4c and f, it was seen that the WO3 nanoparticles were supported on carbon nanosheets, promoting the stabilization of metal oxides onto the surface of N-doped carbon support. Fig. 4g shows the HRTEM image of WO3/NC-600, a lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 0.246 nm was observed, corresponding to the dominant exposed (201) plane of hexagonal WO3 among WO3/NC-600. The SAED pattern in the inset of Fig. 4f indicated the polycrystalline characteristic of WO3/NC-600 composite. Fig. 4h shows the elemental mappings of WO3/NC-600 by EDS, demonstrating the presence of elements C, N, O and W, and no other impurity elements were introduced into the catalyst during the preparation process. In addition, TGA was performed to investigate the actual mass content of WO3 among the WO3/N-doped carbon composites. As shown in Fig. 5, bare WO3 was stable and displayed negligible weight loss though the temperature was up to 800 °C, and the bare N-doped carbon started to decompose at around 450 °C and burnt out at around 670 °C. It should be noted that the burnout temperatures of N-doped carbon among the WO3/NC composites were around 550–600 °C, lower than that of the bare N-doped carbon (670 °C), indicating that WO3 could act as a catalyst and facilitated the combustion of N-doped carbon among the composites [44]. Based on the remaining weight after heating the samples to 800 °C, the actual mass contents of WO3 among the composites were calculated to be 38.4, 43.7, 56.5 and 60.8% for WO3/NC-400, 500, 600 and 700 catalysts, respectively. The higher calcination temperature of catalysts led to a decrease of N-doped carbon content among the composites, and a balance between the WO3 and N-doped carbon content was essential to achieve higher catalytic activity. On the other hand, the effects of the different reaction parameters (such as reaction time, reaction temperature, oxidant dosage and catalyst amount) on the catalytic performance were also studied. It should be noted that in this reaction, benzaldehyde was the main product and also the target product (as shown in Fig. S2), and meanwhile, a small amount of by-products (benzoic acid and benzyl benzoate) were also formed due to the over-oxidation of benzaldehyde and other side reactions. Fig. 6a shows the influence of reaction time on the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde at a reaction temperature of 80 °C, it was found that the conversion of benzyl alcohol significantly increased, and then reached a plateau with the reaction time of over 4 h. Conversely, the selectivity of target product would gradually decrease after the reaction proceeded for 4 h, indicating that the optimum reaction time would be 4 h, at which the highest yield of benzaldehyde could be obtained. Fig. 6b shows the catalytic activity as a function of reaction temperature, poor conversions of benzyl alcohol were observed when the reaction temperature was less than 50 °C, but a sharp increase of benzyl alcohol conversion from 15.5% to 96.5% was found when the temperature was increased from 50 to 80 °C. That indicated the endothermic nature of this oxidation reaction, and relatively high temperature was able to facilitate the reaction process. However, higher temperature (over 80 °C) could result in the drastic self-decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which was unfavorable for this reaction process. Fig. S3a shows the effect of oxidant dosage on the catalytic performance, it could be found that the addition of excess H2O2 decreased the selectivity of benzaldehyde, and the optimum H2O2 : benzyl alcohol molar ratio was determined as 1.5 : 1. In addition, as shown in Fig. S3b, a blank experiment (no catalyst added) verified that the catalyst played a crucial role for this oxidation reaction, and nearly no benzyl alcohol conversion was observed in the absence of catalyst. When the catalyst amount was increased to 10 mg, no obvious improvement in catalytic activity was observed, and thus 5 mg was determined as the optimum catalyst amount for the present catalytic reaction system. Overall, the satisfactory catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde could be achieved over the prepared catalyst under green and mild reaction conditions. Besides, as shown in Table 1 , the several WO3/NC composite catalysts exhibited much better catalytic activity compared to those of bare N-doped carbon and bare WO3, directly demonstrating the promotional synergistic effect of the two components for this reaction. For comparison, a controlled catalyst prepared by a simple physical method (that was by mixing WO3 and N-doped carbon mechanically) was also tested for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, and the result of catalytic activity was presented in Table 1 (Entry 7). It was found that the controlled catalyst (denoted as WO3/NC (phys.)) only afforded 46.8% conversion of benzyl alcohol and 88.5% selectivity of benzaldehyde, much lower than that of the WO3/NC-600 catalyst with strong electronic interaction (as verified by XPS), indicating that the present preparation method was more beneficial to improve the catalytic activity compared to the simple physical method. In addition, the results in Table 1 indicated that 600 °C was the optimum calcination temperature for the preparation of N-doped carbon supported WO3 catalysts, the highest yield of benzaldehyde could be obtained as 94.6% with 96.5% conversion of benzyl alcohol and 98.0% selectivity of benzaldehyde with TOF of 9.9 h−1. TGA results in Fig. 5 suggested that high calcination temperature would decrease the content of N-doped carbon support among the composite catalysts, and meanwhile, the WO3 nanoparticles would agglomerate into bigger clusters when the calcination temperature was up to 700 °C (as shown by the SEM images in Fig. S4). Thus, an optimum balance between N-doped carbon content and WO3 content could be achieved among the WO3/NC-600, finally leading to the highest yield of benzaldehyde among the several prepared WO3/NC composite catalysts. On the other hand, a comparison of the present catalytic system with the other published works was shown in Table 2 , it was found that the catalytic activity of the prepared WO3/NC-600 catalyst was competitive (even superior) compared to those of the other heterogeneous catalysts. In consideration of the good result for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the substrate scope of the prepared WO3/NC-600 catalyst for the selective oxidation of other alcohols was also expanded. As shown in Table 3 , benzyl alcohol with different substituents (Entries 2−4) could be selectively oxidized to corresponding aromatic aldehydes within 5 to 6 h, and the obtained yields of all target products were over 90%. Additionally, as a typical secondary aromatic alcohol, 1-phenylethanol was readily converted into corresponding ketone with 97.0% yield under mild reaction conditions (Entry 5). Besides the aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols were also used to evaluate the catalytic activity of the prepared catalyst (Entries 6−8). However, compared to that of aromatic alcohols, the selective oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to corresponding ketones/aldehydes was more challenging, it was found that only acceptable to good yields of the target products were achieved though increasing the reaction time and oxidant dosage. Such results can be ascribed to the easier adsorption of aromatic alcohols via π-π interaction between the aromatic ring of reactants and catalyst surface compared with aliphatic alcohols, which facilitated the reaction process and thus improved the catalytic performance [46]. In general, the present catalytic system was applicable for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with different substituents and some aliphatic alcohols to corresponding ketone/aldehydes under mild conditions. The recycle stability of the prepared composite catalysts was also investigated with WO3/NC-600 as the representative catalyst. The catalyst was recovered from the reaction mixture via simple centrifugation, followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol thoroughly and then dried in an oven overnight. The filtrate was transferred to inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Varian 730-ES) for analysis, and the result indicated that no metal species was dissolved during the reaction process. As shown in Fig. 7, the catalytic activity of WO3/NC-600 was almost unchanged during the seven recycles, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity of benzaldehyde both maintained at above 95% and no significant activity loss was observed. A hot-filtration test during this reaction process was also performed (Fig. S5), it was found that when the catalyst was removed from the reaction system at reaction time of 2.5 h, negligible increase of benzyl alcohol conversion was observed though the reaction time was extended, verifying the excellent leaching resistance capability of the prepared catalyst. Additionally, the structure of the catalyst after seven runs was also studied, and the XRD pattern of the used catalyst was similar to that of the fresh one (Fig. S6). The above results indicated that the prepared catalyst possessed an excellent long-term stability, making it a highly potential alternative in the future industrial catalysis applications. In addition, a possible reaction mechanism for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 over the WO3/NC-600 composite catalyst was proposed (Scheme 1 ). The reaction pathway mainly includes the following steps: adsorption of reactants on catalyst surface, generation of metal-peroxo complex intermediate, dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol and the formation of benzaldehyde [47,48]. One the one hand, N-doped carbon possesses a graphene-like structural matrix, making the benzyl alcohol molecules can easily get access to the surface of the supported catalyst due to the π-π interaction [49]. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide molecule is activated by the distributed WO3 to generate a metal-peroxo complex intermediate, which is generally considered as an active reaction oxygen species during the liquid-solid phase oxidation reaction with H2O2 as the oxidant [50,51]. Subsequently, the metal-peroxo complex attacks the benzyl alcohol molecules and the hydrogen atoms would be removed to yield the target product (benzaldehyde). Moreover, the N-doped carbon support can provide active sites for the immobilization of WO3 nanoparticles induced by the electronic interaction between them. The increased specific surface area of the WO3/NC composite catalyst was also beneficial to the reaction system. Finally, these results collectively contribute to the enhancement of catalytic activity of the prepared composite catalyst for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, a series of N-doped carbon supported WO3 composite catalysts were prepared for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The WO3/N-doped carbon composites exhibited markedly improved catalytic activity due to the synergistic effect between WO3 and N-doped carbon, as well as the larger specific surface area of the composite catalyst. The XPS binding energy shifts of W 4f and N 1s indicated the existence of electronic interaction among the composite, probably contributing to the excellent recyclability of the prepared composite catalyst. In addition, the distribution of WO3 on N-doped carbon increased the exposed active sites and also promoted the accessibility of reactant molecules to the catalytic sites. Besides, the present heterogeneous catalytic system matched well with the development of green chemistry, 96.5% conversion of benzyl alcohol and 98.0% selectivity of benzaldehyde can be achieved within 4 h under mild and green reaction conditions, higher than those of the most recent published works. Besides the benzyl alcohol, the present catalytic system was also applicable for the selective oxidation of various aromatic and aliphatic alcohols to corresponding aldehydes/ketones with satisfactory yields. Finally, this work might provide a feasible way for the design of high-performance N-doped carbon supported WO3 composite catalyst, and also expanded its practical application in the area of heterogeneous catalysis."
