0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, in its molecular form, is quite abundant in nature and, compared to other fuels, it has the highest specific energy and energetic density [1]. It is indeed considered a viable alternative fuel and the “energy carrier” of the future since it is the most environmentally friendly fuel, generating zero emissions when burned for energy recovery [2,3]. Among various hydrogen production processes, the biological methods are less energy intensive, since they can be carried out at ambient temperatures and pressures [4]. Biohydrogen can be produced by both light-driven and dark fermentation bioprocesses. Dark fermentative processes, compared to the photosynthetic processes, have the advantages of high hydrogen efficiency, simplicity of control, low production cost and no dependence on light [5,6]. Moreover, a variety of renewable biomass types, such as wastes and energy crops can be used as feedstock, while metabolites of commercial interest, such as organic acids and solvents, are also generated [7]. Metabolites in which glucose is degraded under anaerobic conditions are mainly organic acids, such as lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric or alcohols such as butanol and ethanol. A highest theoretical yield of 4 mol H2 per mole of glucose is produced during acetic acid fermentation [8], while the production of other organic acids and/or alcohols lowers the yield of H2. For example, the conversion of 1 mol of glucose into butyrate is accompanied by the production of only 2 mol of H2 while glucose conversion into propionic acid and ethanol leads to negative and zero yields of hydrogen, respectively. Moreover, the metabolism of glucose toward acetate may occur via a non-hydrogen yielding pathway where one molecule of glucose is converted to three molecules of acetic acid [9]. In mixed acid fermentation processes, the involved microorganisms typically produce a spectrum of metabolic products rather than only acetic acid, and this consequently leads to hydrogen yields lower than the maximum possible. The predominance of different fermentative pathways for sugars degradation is mainly due to different environmental and/or operating conditions (pH, Hydraulic Retention Time, substrate concentration, temperature, etc) [10,11]. Although the qualitative importance of each parameter for fermentative hydrogen production is known, little has been done in determining the optimum conditions. It is true indeed that the optimum values of the determinative parameters depend on the feedstock, the inoculum used and the prevailing conditions under which the experiments are carried out [12]. Among the various factors that determine process performance, the substrate concentration is especially important. According to Yu and Fang [13] the influent organic concentration influences the distribution of metabolic products during fermentation. Up to now, the majority of studies report the influence of substrate concentration on fermentative hydrogen production in batch systems [14–17]. Although batch mode fermentative hydrogen production is frequently carried out for research purposes [18,19], industrially feasible processes would most likely have to be performed on a continuous or at least semi-continuous basis [20]. So far, the effect of substrate concentration on fermentative hydrogen production has not been addressed adequately, even though this is a very important parameter in determining the economic and technical feasibility of the process [8]. To date, most successful continuous fermentation studies have been performed at constant feed carbohydrate concentrations of 10–20 g COD/L [21,22]. Some studies have also been reported dealing with higher initial feeding concentrations such as 40g COD/L [23,24]. To our knowledge, only few studies investigated the effect of initial COD concentration on continuous fermentative hydrogen production using pure substrates – such as glucose or sucrose [25–27] or wastewaters such as rice winery wastewater [28] as feedstocks. In the present study, the effect of feed carbohydrate concentration on the continuous hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract is presented. Sweet sorghum is an annual plant of tropical origin, well adapted to sub-tropical and temperate regions, highly productive in biomass and rich in readily fermentable sugars [21]. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of fermentative hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract at different HRTs [21] and pH values [20]. Having extracted the readily dissolved carbohydrates in the form of an extract, one may vary the feed concentration to a hydrogen-producing reactor arbitrarily. In the present study, the influence of substrate concentration on the hydrogen production rate and yield was investigated and the possibility of high hydrogen yields using more concentrated or more diluted sweet sorghum extract was explored. In general, the use of more concentrated sweet sorghum extract has the advantage of reduced consumption of water during the extraction process, contributing significantly to the total cost of the process. However, the cost assessment of each parameter should be determined and taken into account in a thorough sustainability analysis of the process of fermentative hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract [29]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Analytical methods,"2.1 Analytical methods Determinations of chemical oxygen demand of the mixed liquor (TCOD) or of only the soluble part (SCOD), total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were carried out according to Standard Methods [30]. For the quantification of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ethanol (EtOH), 1 mL of filtered sample acidified with 30 μL of 20% H2SO4 was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (VARIAN CP-30), equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (Agilent technologies, INC. 30 m × 0.53 mm). The oven was programmed from 105 °C to 160 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min, and subsequently to 235 °C (held for 3 min) at a rate of 20 °C/min for VFA analysis and from 60 °C (held for 1 min) to 230 °C (held for 0.5 min) at a rate of 45 °C/min for ethanol analysis. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 15 mL/min, the injector temperature was set at 175 °C and the detector at 225 °C and 200 °C, for VFA and ethanol determinations respectively. The concentration of lactic acid was measured on a liquid chromatograph (DIONEX DX300), equipped with an electron conductivity detector and a Dionex IonPac column (AS11-HC, 4 × 250 mm Analytical). The eluent (sodium hydroxide solution) flow rate was 1.5 mL/min and the analysis was carried out at 30 °C. The produced gas composition in hydrogen and methane was quantified with a gas chromatograph (VARIAN STAR 3600) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a packed column with nitrogen as carrier gas. The injector, column and detector temperatures were set at 70 °C, 80 °C and 180 °C respectively. The measurement of the produced gas volume was based on the displacement of acidified water. For the determination of carbohydrates, a colored sugar derivative was produced through the addition of l-tryptophan and sulfuric and boric acids and subsequently measured colorimetrically at 520 nm [31]. The measurement of the pH was done using a HANNA (pH 211) pH-meter with a HANNA (HI 1230) electrode."
3,Extraction of sweet sorghum biomass,"2.2 Extraction of sweet sorghum biomass Sweet sorghum biomass (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) used in the present study was produced in field experiments through biological farming techniques according to European Regulation EC 2092/91 [21]. After plant harvesting, the fresh stems were stripped from the leaves and the stalks were chopped to a size of 20 cm, stored in the freezer at −20 °C and milled by a laboratory grinder to an average particle size of 1–2 mm. The main sugars contained in its stalks are sucrose and glucose [32] that can be removed either as juice, using mechanical pressure [33,34] or as an extract solution using hot water extraction [35]. Extraction of free sugars of the sorghum biomass was done in batches as proposed by Antonopoulou et al. [21], where the standard sorghum extract containing almost 17.5 ± 2.0 g soluble carbohydrates was obtained. The standard sorghum extract was used in the experiments which were carried out so far. In this study, the different concentrations of carbohydrates were achieved through changing the ratio of water and sweet sorghum biomass. By mixing 2.5, 5 or 10 kg of milled sorghum stalks with 30 L of tap water for 1 h, at 30 °C and separation of the solid fraction, the concentration of the carbohydrates in the liquid fraction in g/L glucose equivalents was 9.89 ± 0.30 (diluted sorghum extract- DSE), 17.5 ± 2.0 (standard sorghum extract-CSE) and 20.99 ± 1.00 (concentrated sorghum extract-CSE), respectively. The main characteristics of the each sorghum extract used for fermentative hydrogen production in this study are shown in Table 1 ."
4,Experimental setup and operation,"2.3 Experimental setup and operation A double walled stainless steel, cylindrical CSTR-type reactor with a working volume of 0.5 L was operated under mesophilic (35 °C) conditions. Two different series of experiment were carried out, so that the influence of both lower and then higher carbohydrates concentration was investigated. For both series, during start-up, the reactor was filled up with 500 mL sweet sorghum extract supplemented with 2 g/L urea (NH2CONH2) and a buffer solution consisting of 2.24 g/L NaOH and 6.8025 g/L KH2PO4 and operated anaerobically at a batch mode at 35 °C for 24 h in order to activate the indigenous microflora contained in sweet sorghum extract [21]. Following start-up, the operation of the hydrogen-producing reactor was subsequently switched to a continuous mode at an HRT of 12 h and with a loading rate of 1L/d. At both series of experiments, the reactor was initially fed with sweet sorghum extract which also contained urea and the buffer solution. When the reactor reached steady state, sorghum extract was replaced with diluted sorghum extract at the first series of experiments and with concentrated sorghum extract at the second series, respectively. Diluted sorghum extract was supplemented with 1.17 g/L urea and a buffer solution consisting of 1.32 g/L NaOH and 4.00 g/L KH2PO4 while concentrated sorghum extract was supplemented with 2.29 g/L urea and a buffer solution consisting of 2.57 g/L NaOH and 7.81 g/L KH2PO4 in order to maintain the pH culture at the desirable pH levels which allow hydrogen production. In both cases, the reactor was operated anaerobically and was under steady state at an HRT of 12 h which was found to be optimum when fermentative hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract was studied at HRTs of 24–4 h [21]. The reactor was stirred periodically for 15 min, 2 times per hour. It was fed intermittently, every 3 h with sweet sorghum extract kept at 4 °C. Feeding was programmed always with the stirring on. Simultaneous flow of the effluent occurred during feeding by liquid overflow, in order to maintain constant reactor volume. As a result, a portion of the feed was removed with the effluent and the initial concentration of carbohydrates for every feeding cycle could be calculated using the following equation: (1) S = S 0 − ( S 0 − S in ) × e − ( Q / V ) ×t where S is the resulting concentration when feeding was completed, S0 is the influent concentration, Sin is the concentration when feeding started, namely the concentration measured at the end of each cycle, Q is the volumetric feeding rate, V is the reactor volume and t is the duration of feeding. Gas and liquid samples were collected 10–15 min before the start of a feeding, once a day. In all experiments, the reactor performance (biogas production and composition in H2, pH, carbohydrates, soluble COD, ethanol, butanol, lactic acid and VFAs concentration) was monitored daily. Gas samples were also analyzed for methane daily, in order to monitor whether methane production occurred. Complete characterization was made once a steady state was reached. By steady state, it is meant, that the variation of the monitoring parameters in time was less than 10%, at least for 5 successive measurements (usually more than 6 HRTs)."
5,Stoichiometric analysis of the products and biomass yields,"2.4 Stoichiometric analysis of the products and biomass yields Volatile suspended solids (VSS) measured at each steady state did not represent microbial biomass concentration since sweet sorghum extract contained already some VSS as shown in Table 1. However, estimation of biomass yields at each steady state was done using stoichiometric calculations based on products yields and calculation of the glucose electron equivalents been partitioned between energy production (catabolism of glucose to various products) and biomass synthesis [36]. Stoichiometric analysis was feasible because all products have been identified and measured as proved by the COD analysis (see ‘results and discussion’ section, Fig. 3). Assuming glucose as the sole electron donor in our experiments and calculating the fraction of electron equivalents found in each one of the products the theoretical energy reaction was constructed (see ‘results and discussion’ section, Table 5). The fraction of the glucose electron equivalents used for energy production (f e) was calculated from the difference between the product yields predicted by the theoretical energy reaction and the actual measured yields. The fraction of the glucose electron equivalents used for cell synthesis (f s) was then calculated using the Eq. (2). (2) f s + f e = 1 Subsequently, the microbial biomass yield was calculated using Eq. (3) and the microbial cell synthesis reaction (4) with glucose as carbon and energy source, NH3 as nitrogen source (urea was added as nitrogen source) and C5H7O2N used as empirical formula for microbial cells. (3) biomass yield in g / mole glucose = f s · 24 20 · 113 where 113 is the molecular-weight of the empirical cell formula in g/mole and 24 and 20 are coefficients derived from Eq. (4). (4) 1 24 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 1 20 NH 3 → 1 20 C 5 H 7 O 2 N + 3 20 H 2 O"
6,Results and discussion,"There was no seed sludge used for the inoculation of the bioreactor. The bioreactor was filled with sorghum extract during start-up and left to operate in batch mode until the hydrogen-producing bacteria, already present in the microflora of sweet sorghum biomass, were activated [20,21]. This practice was also applied in cheese whey wastewater [9,24] but is not frequently applied since the most common strategy is to subject the seed to heat treatment in order to inactivate the hydrogen-consuming bacteria [37]. However, using the indigenous microbial population of the feedstock without any pretreatment allows for the natural selection of the desirable species depending on the operating conditions. Two different series of experiments were carried out. After start-up, at both cases, the reactor was fed with standard sorghum extract, at an HRT of 12 h, with an influent flow rate of 1 L/d. This HRT value corresponded to a carbohydrates loading rate of 194.4 mmol/L reactor/d. After that, diluted (at the first series of experiment) and concentrated (at the second series of experiment) sorghum extract was fed into the reactor. Diluted sorghum extract contained 9.89 ± 0.30 g carbohydrates/L while the concentrated sorghum extract contained 20.99 ± 1.00, respectively. As it was anticipated, diluted sorghum extract contained almost the half of the carbohydrates concentration which was contained in the sorghum extract, since the half of sweet sorghum biomass quantity (2.5 instead of 5 kg) was used during extraction process. However, the concentration of the soluble carbohydrates which was contained in concentrated sorghum extract was not, as it was anticipated, two-fold higher, compared to the respective contained in standard sorghum extract. This means that the liquid fraction of the extraction process was saturated in sugars and no more sugars could be extracted from sweet sorghum biomass. The saturation concentration seems to be close to 17.5 g/L, which implies that the extraction process as proposed by Antonopoulou et al. [21] was most effective in terms of water and biomass use regarding the maximum soluble carbohydrates extraction efficiency. This is beneficial for the economy of the process, since the use of 5 instead of 10 kg of sweet sorghum biomass for the extraction of only 20% less soluble sugars (17.5 ± 2.0 instead of 20.99 ± 1.00 g/L) means a 50% reduction of the cost of the raw materials. Sweet sorghum is an energy crop which has a high cultivation cost [38], contributing significantly to the total cost of the process. From the other side, the use of more concentrated extract has the advantage of reduced water need during the extraction process, since the ratio of water/biomass is lower. In Fig. 1 (a and b), the content of hydrogen in the gas phase and hydrogen production rate during the experimental period, is presented. It should be noted that during the operation of the hydrogenogenic reactor, no traces of methane were detected at any time, indicating lack or suppression of methanogens in the microbial consortium. In general, the composition of hydrogen in the gas phase was between 37 and 38% when the reactor was fed with standard sorghum extract and concentrated extract and decreased to 25% when the reactor was fed with diluted sorghum extract. The mean values of the corresponding hydrogen production rates and hydrogen yields in each steady state are presented in Table 2 . It is obvious that the main characteristics of the reactor, when it was fed with standard sorghum extract were very similar for both series of experiments, verifying the repeatability of the experimental results obtained. Diluted sorghum extract, which contained half of the carbohydrates concentration than the standard sorghum extract, produced only 0.34 ± 0.03 L H2/d or 0.68 ± 0.06 L H2/L reactor/d while standard sorghum extract produced approximately 1.47 ± 0.1 L H2/d or 2.94 ± 0.2 L H2/L reactor/d. However, the concentrated sorghum extract which contained 20.99 ± 1.00 g/L carbohydrates reached almost the same rate of hydrogen evolution (1.35 ± 0.1 L H2/d or 2.70 ± 0.2 L H2/L reactor/d) with the standard sorghum extract (1.40 ± 0.1 L H2/d or 2.80 ± 0.2 L H2/L reactor/d). The pH of the microbial culture remained at 5.7 ± 0.1 when diluted sorghum extract was fed into the reactor while it decreased slightly to 5.5 ± 0.1 with the addition of the concentrated sorghum extract. TSS and VSS concentration decreased from 3.86 ± 0.34 to 3.21 ± 0.26 g/L and 2.89 ± 0.22 to 2.40 ± 0.27 g/L respectively, with the addition of diluted sorghum extract while increased with the addition of concentrated sorghum extract, from 3.83 ± 0.36 to 4.40 ± 0.39 and 2.85 ± 0.26 to 3.22 ± 0.33 g/L, respectively. The efficiency of total carbohydrates consumption in glucose equivalents (Table 2) was greater than 98.5% at all steady states. The hydrogen yield along with the hydrogen production rate decreased significantly, with the reduction of the influent carbohydrates. Specifically, the addition of the diluted extract in the hydrogenogenic reactor resulted in a hydrogen yield of 0.28 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol glucose consumed or 4.07 L H2/kg sweet sorghum instead of 0.74 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol glucose consumed or 8.81 L H2/kg sweet sorghum, when standard sorghum extract was fed into the reactor. When concentrated sorghum extract was added to the reactor, the obtained yield of hydrogen decreased by 15% and was 0.59 ± 0.04 mol H2/mol glucose consumed which corresponded only to 4.05 L H2/kg sweet sorghum, given that the double quantity of sweet sorghum biomass, was used during the extraction process. In order to decide for the optimal substrate concentration value within the range tested for a full-scale plant, it is necessary to take into account both economic (based on water and biomass cost) and technical (based on hydrogen yield) aspects. At the concentration values of 9.89 ± 0.30 and 20.99 ± 1.00 g/L, the hydrogen yields were significantly lower and taking into account the most effective extraction efficiency that probably took place at the carbohydrates concentration of 17.5 ± 2.0 g/L, it can be concluded that the optimum, within the range tested, value for hydrogen production was close to carbohydrates concentration of 17.5 ± 1.0 g/L. From the experimental results obtained, it is obvious that increasing substrate concentration in an appropriate range, the ability of hydrogen-producing bacteria to produce hydrogen could increase; but increasing substrate concentrations to higher levels could cause a decrease of the obtained hydrogen yields and rates. The experimental results obtained are in agreement with the results from other studies using different substrates and substrate concentrations. Kim et al. [26] who studied the effect of initial sucrose concentration (10–60g COD/L) in continuous fermentative hydrogen production from sucrose reported that the hydrogen production was higher at a sucrose concentration of 30 g COD/L while the specific hydrogen production rate decreased at sucrose concentrations over 35 g COD/L, which implied that hydrogen production activity was inhibited within this range of sucrose concentrations. Lay reported that hydrogen production was significantly inhibited, when microcrystalline cellulose exceeded 25 g/L, when batch fermentative hydrogen production from cellulose was studied at initial cellulose concentration of 12.5–50 g/L [14]. In addition, other studies in batch systems reported that an initial substrate concentration of 20 g COD/L for xylose [39], 10.7 g COD/L for glucose [40], 9.8 g COD/L for starch [41], 6.4 g COD/L for food waste [42] and 5.9 g COD/L for rice slurry [43] was optimum for hydrogen production. Nevertheless, there are also studies reporting different initial substrate concentration values as optimum which could be attributed to the differences in terms of inocula, substrates, reactor configurations and pH range studied [12]. For example, Lee et al. [16] reported that the initial concentration of 32g COD/L was optimum for hydrogen-producing bacteria in a batch reactor using starch at a range of 8-32g COD/L, while Zheng et al. [44] reported that maximum hydrogen production rate using glucose in a batch reactor was observed at a substrate concentration of 1.1 g COD/L. The concentrations of the main metabolic products versus time are presented in Fig. 2 while Table 3 contains the yields of the main metabolic products, produced at steady state, at both series of experiments. Butanol, valeric, isovaleric and isobutyric acids were not detected during the experimental period. It is obvious that the distribution of the main metabolic products is different at each steady state. Acetic acid reached the highest concentration of 1.36 ± 0.20 g/L when sorghum extract with a carbohydrates concentration of 17.5 ± 2.0 g/L was fed to the reactor while its concentration reduced to 0.73 ± 0.10 g/L when the reactor fed with the diluted sorghum extract. Propionic acid concentration was high during the operation of the reactor and was favored at low initial carbohydrates concentrations reaching a value of 1.8 ± 0.2 g/L. As presented in the Fig. 2, the dominant metabolic product during the operational period was butyric acid. Its concentration was 4.49 and 4.86 g/L at 17.50 and 20.99 g/L carbohydrates concentration, respectively. Its concentration decreased, as anticipated, to approximately 2.01 g/L when the carbohydrates concentration of sweet sorghum extract was low (DSE). At the high carbohydrates concentration, the dominant metabolic product along with butyrate was also ethanol, with a concentration of 4.86 g/L. Similar results were also obtained by van Ginkel et al. [45] and Okamoto et al. [46] reporting that at higher initial substrate concentration, the process favored alcohol production rather than acids. Thus it is concluded that a higher production of hydrogen occured with increasing carbohydrates concentration from 9.89 to 17.5 g/L, but there was an upper threshold where the bacterial metabolism shifted to the production of alcohols and beyond which, the production of hydrogen decreased. In general, mixed acid fermentation producing butyrate in excess of acetate occurs upon biological degradation of glucose by clostridia-type microflora [47,48]. In addition, a number of species of clostridia have been found to be involved, in alcohol production [49]. For example Clostridium acetobutylicum shifts its metabolism from VFAs to alcohol production as an adaptive response of the cell to inhibitory effects produced by low molecular-weight VFAs [49,50]. This shift appears to act as a detoxification mechanism which allows the cell to avoid the inhibitory effects that would occur when low molecular-weight VFAs, reach toxic levels. It has also been reported that alcohol production doesn’t initiate until acetate or butyrate concentration reaches a level of 0.4–0.6 g/L [49]. This provides the explanation for the phenomenon that a shift from VFA to alcohol production is often carried out at high-strength wastewaters rather than at mid-strength wastewaters [13], corroborating the experimental results obtained for the higher substrate concentration at the present study. Since the distribution of metabolic products was different at various substrate concentrations, the yield of hydrogen produced, exhibited the same behavior. The higher hydrogen yields were associated with the production of butyric acid, while low hydrogen yields were observed at higher carbohydrates concentration values where the production of reduced end products, such as ethanol, occurred. In the case of diluted sorghum extract, the lower hydrogen yields are associated with the lower butyric acid production. The hydrogen yield can be correlated stoichiometrically with the final metabolic products, through the reactions describing the individual processes of acidogenesis: (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (6) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O The predicted hydrogen production rate, based on the above equations, was calculated as the sum of 2 mmol of hydrogen per 1 mmol of acetic acid produced and of 2 mmol of hydrogen per 1 mmol of butyric acid produced, minus 1 mmol of hydrogen per 1 mmol of propionic acid produced. The mean values of the production yields and rates of acetic, propionic and butyric acids and the theoretically calculated hydrogen production rate based on the measured concentrations of acids at steady state, compared to the experimentally measured hydrogen production rate, at different substrate concentration values are shown in Table 4 . It was observed that the measured hydrogen production rate was much lower than the predicted hydrogen production based on the metabolic products measured. An explanation could be that a considerable amount of the produced hydrogen is probably consumed by hydrogen-consuming microorganisms such as homoacetogenic bacteria which may be establish in the reactor, producing acetic acid reaction (8). Another possibility for the discrepancy between the predicted and measured hydrogen production rates could be that part of the acetic acid may be produced through reaction (9) where no hydrogen is produced via glucose degradation. (8) 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O (9) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 3 CH 3 COOH In Fig. 3 the mean values of the measured and calculated soluble COD (SCOD) concentrations of the reactor content at each steady state are presented. Calculated SCOD concentration represents the sum of the calculated chemical oxygen demand of different products (ethanol, butyric, propionic and acetic acids) as well as the calculated chemical oxygen demand of non-consumed carbohydrates measured as glucose units. The remaining SCOD value after subtracting the calculated SCOD from the measured SCOD concentration corresponds to non-identified metabolic products during glucose fermentation. As presented in Fig. 3, at all steady states the remaining SCOD represented only a very small fraction of the SCOD measured, and thus it can be assumed that the main metabolic products of sweet sorghum sugars fermentation were accounted for."
7,Stoichiometric analysis and biomass yields,"3.1 Stoichiometric analysis and biomass yields The stoichiometrical energy reactions for the four steady states are presented in Table 5 along with the calculated f e and f s values, biomass yields and estimated biomass concentrations in the reactor. It is obvious that higher hydrogen yields (Table 2) in the mixed microbial consortium were accompanied by higher microbial biomass yields under anaerobic conditions. This is consistent with the study of Chen et al. [51] on glucose metabolism by Clostridium butyricum, a strictly anaerobic bacterium, where it was shown that the more hydrogen was produced the more microbial cells were synthesized."
8,Conclusions,"In this study, the effect of substrate concentration on continuous fermentative hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract was investigated. The process was carried out at an HRT of 12 h under mesophilic conditions and at initial carbohydrates concentrations of 9.89–20.99 g/L in glucose equivalents. Maximum hydrogen efficiency (production rate of 2.93 ± 0.09 L H2/L reactor/d and yield of 0.74 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol glucose consumed) was achieved at the concentration of 17.5 g/L. This yield corresponded to the production of 8.81 ± 0.02 L H2/kg sweet sorghum biomass. Butyric acid was the main metabolic product at all steady states while at high substrate concentration the concentration of ethanol was also high. This indicated that the production of hydrogen increased with increasing carbohydrates concentration from 9.89 to 17.5 g/L, but there is an upper threshold where the bacterial metabolism shifted to the production of alcohols and hydrogen yield decreased."
