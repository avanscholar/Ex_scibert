0,Introduction,"Research on renewable energy has consistently addressed energy and environmental problems [1–3]. Among the renewable energy sources, hydrogen is considered as one of the most promising ecofriendly sources because of its high energy density and carbon-emission-free system [4,5]. Hydrogen can be produced by electrochemical water-splitting, which converts water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules, in the presence of electrocatalysts [6–10]. In this technology, it is well-known that platinum-based compounds are the most active electrocatalysts for HER [11,12]. However, their high-cost and scarcity are limitations to their extensive utilization and large-scale application [13]. Therefore, it is significantly beneficial to investigate the noble metal–free electrocatalysts exhibiting high electrocatalytic performance toward HER. However, the development of these electrocatalytic materials remains a challenge. As potential HER electrocatalysts, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are considered to be promising alternatives because of their high electrocatalytic activity and stability [7,14–16]. Among the TMP electrocatalysts, molybdenum phosphide (MoP) is a suitable HER electrocatalyst because of its electronic structure, which is similar to those of the platinum-group metals, as well as its high electrocatalytic activity and stability over a wide pH range [17–19]. Particularly, nano-sized MoP can significantly increase the number of exposed active sites, and well-defined MoP nanostructures, with large surface areas, can promote the reaction kinetics [18–20]. However, the synthesis of MoP nano-electrocatalysts suffers from the inevitable severe particle aggregation and non-uniform distribution of the Mo-based nano-precursors, owing to the high reaction temperature (generally over 600 °C), leading to few electrochemical active sites and low electron transfer, which in turn, resulted in degraded HER performance [21–25]. Hence, many researchers have attempted to develop strategies to inhibit the aggregation of MoP by either introducing other components or by combining them with support components. For example, Z. Pu et al. synthesized MoP nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon, where the nitrogen-doped carbon inhibited the aggregation of MoP NPs, resulting in higher electrocatalytic HER activity compared to that with bulk MoP [26]. Further, Y. Teng et al. synthesized MoP nanowires (NWs), which maintained their original morphology after thermal phosphidation on the carbon cloth (CC), by the phosphidation of an iron molybdenum oxide (Fe2Mo2O9–12) NW precursor on CC and a subsequent acid treatment [27]. Based on the foregoing, in this study, we propose the novel strategy for the synthesis of MoP nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on porous carbon cloth (MoP@PCC) for efficient HER electrocatalyst in a wide pH range. So, we developed a facile method of fabricating MoP NPs supported on a MoP@PCC electrode as an active and stable HER electrocatalyst with a wide pH range, in which MoP NPs were uniformly distributed on PCC. For the fabrication of MoP@PCC, ultrafine MoO2 NPs, which were obtained from electrical explosion of Mo wire, were coated on PCC [28], followed by the thermal phosphidation of the molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) NPs anchored on PCC (MoO2@PCC). For comparison, MoP NPs cast on CC were also prepared. Benefiting from the reduction of aggregation between MoP NPs and their uniform distribution on PCC, the MoP@PCC electrocatalyst exhibited good performance in HER over a wide pH range, especially in alkaline and neutral solutions. Furthermore, its long-term stability was identified by the microstructural and chemical analyses after the electrocatalytic tests."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of MoO2 NPs and the MoO2 nanoink,"2.1 Synthesis of MoO2 NPs and the MoO2 nanoink MoO2 NPs were synthesized by electrically exploding a Mo wire in deionized water, using electrical pulse equipment (NTi–10C, Nano Technology Inc.), as described in our previous reports [28]. Thereafter, the MoO2 colloidal solution was passed through Millipore filters and lyophilized to obtain MoO2 NPs. The MoO2 nanoink was prepared by dispersing MoO2 NPs (1 g) over deionized water (10 mL) for 40 min with ultrasonication."
3,Fabrication of MoO2@PCC,"2.2 Fabrication of MoO2@PCC PCC was fabricated by the thermal etching of bare CC, which was described in our previous report [29]. A piece of PCC was dipped into the MoO2 nanoink for 5 min with ultrasonication. After that, PCC was removed and dried overnight at room temperature."
4,Syntheses of MoP NPs and MoP@PCC,"2.3 Syntheses of MoP NPs and MoP@PCC MoP NPs and MoP@PCC were synthesized by phosphidation, through a solid/gas phase reaction process. MoO2 NPs (0.5 mmol) or MoO2@PCC were placed in an alumina boat and placed in the heat zone of a tube furnace. NaH2PO2·2H2O (10 mmol) was placed in an alumina square dish and placed in the upstream of the furnace. The samples were preheated at 400 °C for 2 h with flowing Ar/H2 (5%) gas. After preheating, the temperature was raised to 500–700 °C, after which the tube was slightly moved, to generate PH3 gas, and held for 1–2 h."
5,Characterization,2.4 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was conducted with a JEOL JEM-2100 F microscope. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping were conducted on a Hitachi SU-70. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed by K-alpha+ and a Thermo Fisher Scientific was employed for the surface chemical analysis.
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements The electrocatalytic performance toward HER was evaluated in a three-electrode cell configuration using a potentiostat workstation (Ivium Technologies). The MoP NPs catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the catalyst (20 mg) in a water/isopropyl alcohol solution (750/200 μL, respectively) with Nafion solution (5 wt%, 50 μL), followed by ultrasonication for 30 min. Thereafter, the catalyst ink (50 μL) was dropped onto the PCC and dried to obtain MoP NPs cast on PCC (loading mass: 1 mg cm−2 GSA). MoP@PCC was directly employed as the working electrode (average loading mass: 1 mg cm−2 GSA). A Hg/HgO or saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode in the alkaline, neutral, or acidic solution. A graphite rod was employed as the counter electrode. Further, 1 M KOH (pH 14), 1 M PBS (pH 7), and 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH 0.3) were utilized as the electrolytes. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (at least three times) to ensure the reliability of the results. All the potentials were converted to RHE using the following equation: EHg/HgO + 0.0591 × pH + 0.098 or ERHE = ESCE + 0.0591 × pH + 0.241. The EIS measurements were performed at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 100 mHz."
7,Results and discussion,"Prior to fabricating MoP@PCC, we explored the synthetic condition of MoP NPs, employing ultrafine MoO2 NPs as precursors. MoO2 NPs were prepared by the electrical explosion of Mo wire, which is a suitable and effective approach toward synthesizing well-defined nanoparticles [28]. After exploding the Mo wire in deionized water (2000 times), the colloidal solution was filtered and lyophilized to obtain MoO2 NPs (Fig. 1 a). The XRD patterns of the acquired sample showed that all the reflected peaks were well consistent with those in the MoO2 reference data (lower graph in Fig. 1b). Further, it was reasonable to expect that ultrafine nanocrystals would be formed by considering the broad XRD peaks. Indeed, the TEM image revealed that as-exploded MoO2 possessed an ultrafine morphology, which its size was below 20 nm (Fig. S1a). However, the FE-SEM image showed that the primary MoO2 NPs were severely agglomerated to form secondary particles of larger sizes (than MoO2 NPs) of 100–150 nm (Fig. 1c). Next, MoP NPs were synthesized by a thermal phosphidation process, employing the MoO2 NP precursors. Phosphidation was carried out at various temperatures between 500 and 700 °C for 1–2 h. The MoP phase began to form at temperatures over 600 °C, but a small amount of the MoO2 phase could still be observed (Fig. S2). However, phase-pure MoP was synthesized at 700 °C for 2 h (upper graph in Fig. 1b). Although the MoO2 precursors were small, the high temperature was required to completely transform them into MoP NPs. For this reason, the MoP NPs synthesized at 700 °C exhibited particle sizes over 100 nm and they were severely aggregated (Fig. 1d and S1b). Despite the ultra-small sizes of MoO2 NPs, severe agglomeration occurred during high-temperature thermal treatment, resulting in large particle sizes and the severe aggregation of MoP NPs. To inhibit the increase in the particle size and aggregation between the particles, as-exploded MoO2 NPs were uniformly coated on the conducting substrate by a dip-coating process, followed by thermal phosphidation to fabricate the MoP NPs–coated freestanding electrode. PCC, which was modified by the thermal etching of bare CC, was utilized as the conductive substrate (Fig. S3a) because CC possesses excellent electrical conductivity and chemical stability [30–32], and its high porosity would increase the contact area between MoO2 and CC [29]. After PCC was dipped in the MoO2 nanoink, the rough surface of PCC became smooth (Fig. S3b), implying the uniform coating of MoO2 NPs on PCC, i.e. MoO2@PCC. MoO2@PCC was thermally treated by the same phosphidation process at various temperatures to synthesize MoP@PCC. Notably, there were some differences between the synthesis of MoP NPs and that of MoP@PCC, where the phase-pure MoP could be synthesized at a lower temperature of 600 °C (Fig. 2 a, denoted as MoP@PCC-x after phosphidation at x °C). The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image clearly elucidated the lattice fringes of 0.26 nm corresponding to the (100) plane of MoP (Fig. 2b), thus revealing the synthesis of the MoP phase. Further, the EDS elemental mapping of MoP@PCC-600 revealed that MoP was well-attached and uniformly coated on the surface of PCC (Fig. 2c). The atomic ratio of Mo to P by EDS elemental mapping was estimated at 0.499:0.501, which also demonstrated the formation of MoP. MoP NPs on PCC were further analyzed by TEM. Although the MoP NPs on the surface of PCC continued aggregating, their primary particle size was below 100 nm and smaller compared to that of the aggregated MoP NPs (inset of Fig. 2a). During the phosphidation of the undesirably agglomerated MoO2 NPs, the higher temperature was required to synthesize MoP because of the longer diffusion length of the P source to the inside of the particle. Contrarily, the thin and uniform coating of the MoO2 precursor on PCC only required a low energy barrier of P diffusion to form MoP. As a result, MoP with smaller particle sizes could be synthesized at a lower temperature (Fig. 2d). The electrocatalytic performance of as-synthesized electrocatalysts toward HER was evaluated in a wide pH range. To demonstrate this, MoP NPs cast on PCC and MoP@PCC (each exposed area: 1 × 1 cm2), were employed as the working electrodes. All the potentials were corrected with iR compensation, after which they were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potentials. Before evaluating electrocatalytic activity of MoP, we investigated the electrocatalytic performance of MoO2@PCC in wide pH range, but it did not show electrocatalytic activity toward HER (Fig. S4). The electrocatalytic performance in HER was firstly tested in an alkaline environment. Fig. 3 a shows the polarization curves of MoP NPs, MoP@PCC-600, and MoP@PCC-700 in a 1 M KOH solution. MoP@PCC-600 outperformed MoP NPs in all the tested potential ranges, in terms of their electrocatalytic activities. MoP@PCC-600 required low overpotentials of 122, 164, and 174 mV at current densities of −10, −50, and −100 mA cm−2, respectively, while MoP NPs required the higher overpotentials of 192, 250, and 274 mV to achieve the same current densities. Moreover, the electrocatalytic activity of MoP@PCC-700 was evaluated to further investigate the effect of the uniform distribution of MoP NPs on PCC toward HER activity. MoP@PCC-700 also exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity than MoP NPs synthesized at the same temperature (700 °C), demonstrating the superiority of the freestanding MoO2@PCC electrode fabricated through the dip-coating process. However, MoP@PCC-700 exhibited lower electrocatalytic properties than MoP@PCC-600 synthesized at the low temperature due to severe aggregation (Fig. S8). Double-layer capacitance (Cdl), proportional to the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), was determined based on the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test (Fig. S5), in which Cdl of MoP@PCC-600 (24.7 mF cm−2) was larger than that of MoP NPs (2.6 mF cm−2), suggesting a much larger ECSA of MoP@PCC-600 (Fig. 3b). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at an overpotential of 120 mV. MoP@PCC-600 exhibited a lower charge-transfer resistance (0.6 Ω) than MoP NPs (3.2 Ω), as shown in the Nyquist plots (Fig. S6), indicating the fast charge transfer with MoP@PCC. This means that the uniform coating and reduced aggregation of MoP NPs would improve their electrocatalytic activity for HER. Additionally, when the polarization curves were normalized to ECSA, MoP@PCC-600 also exhibited higher intrinsic electrocatalytic activity than MoP MPs (Fig. S7). The Tafel slope of MoP@PCC-600 (60 mV dec−1), derived from the polarization curves, was much smaller than that of MoP NPs (131 mV dec−1), indicating the faster reaction rate with MoP@PCC than with MoP NPs (Fig. 3c). We also prepared 10 MoP@PCC-600 samples by the same fabrication process and measured their electrocatalytic performances in HER (Fig. S9 and Table S1). All the MoP@PCC-600 samples exhibited consistent performance in HER and their average onset potential were 81 ± 5.3 mV, and overpotentials were 123 ± 1.9, 166 ± 3.0, and 178 ± 3.1 mV at current densities of −10, −50, and −100 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 3d). Noteworthily, a constant amount of MoO2 NPs can be coated on the surface of PCC through the dip-coating process. The MoP NPs were adequately attached to PCC after the heat treatment, suggesting the high reliability of dip-coating and the subsequent phosphidation processes in this work. Next, the long-term stability and durability of MoP@PCC-600 were analyzed. Fig. 3e shows the polarization curve of MoP@PCC-600, obtained before and after continuous CV cycles over a potential range of 0 to −0.2 V (vs RHE) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Compared to the initial curve, the polarization curve exhibited a slight shift after 10,000 CV cycles. Additionally, the chronopotentiometric curve of MoP@PCC-600 demonstrated its excellent long-term stability with continuous operation over 50 h at a constant current density of −10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3f), indicating the high durability of MoP@PCC for HER in an alkaline solution. The electrocatalytic performance of MoP@PCC for HER in a neutral solution was also evaluated. Fig. 4 a shows the polarization curves of MoP NPs, MoP@PCC-600, and MoP@PCC-700 in 1 M phosphate buffered solution (PBS). Likewise, the electrocatalytic activity of MoP@PCC-600 was superior to that of MoP NPs, as it was in the alkaline solution, in which the overpotentials were 161, 218, and 259 mV, at current densities of −10, −50, and −100 mA cm−2, respectively. The Tafel plots exhibited a lower Tafel slope of MoP@PCC-600 (68 mV dec−1), indicating faster reaction kinetics than with MoP NPs (123 mV dec−1) in a neutral solution (Fig. 4b). These values are comparable to those of state-of-the-art MoP electrocatalysts (Table S2). In neutral environments, MoP@PCC-600 exhibited low electrocatalytic activity for HER due to the inherently slow kinetics compared to in an acidic or alkaline environment. Furthermore, the utilization of a Nafion binder would hinder charge transfer, which would consequently degrade the electrocatalytic performance of MoP@PCC-600 [33–35]. However, this MoP@PCC electrode without any binder would result in excellent electrocatalytic activity in neutral solution. Indeed, MoP@PCC-600 intentionally coated with a Nafion binder exhibited lower electrocatalytic activity than binder-free MoP@PCC-600 (Fig. S10), demonstrating the advantage of a freestanding electrode. Additionally, Cdl of MoP@PCC-600 (12.8 mF cm−2) was also larger than that of MoP NPs (2.7 mF cm−2), and MoP@PCC-600 also possessed higher intrinsic electrocatalytic activity than MoP MPs (Fig. S11), indicating that MoP@PCC exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity for HER in alkaline and neutral solutions. The 10 MoP@PCC-600 samples exhibited consistent HER performance (Fig. S12 and Table S3) and their average onset potential were 107 ± 3.6 mV, and overpotentials were 161 ± 2.5, 218 ± 2.5, and 259 ± 4.6 mV at current densities of −10, −50, and −100 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 4c). As shown in Fig. 4d, MoP@PCC-600 demonstrated slight degradation in the polarization curves after the 10,000th CV cycle and in the potential profiles after the chronopotentiometric test over 50 h at a current density of −10 mA cm−2, indicating the high stability and long-term durability of MoP@PCC-600 for HER. Additionally, the electrocatalytic activity of MoP@PCC-600 for HER was investigated in an acidic solution (0.5 M H2SO4), and it was determined to possess a low overpotential of 161 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec−1 (Fig. S13), indicative of its good electrocatalytic activity in an acidic solution. The overpotentials of MoP@PCC in terms of different pH solutions are shown in Fig. S14. It can be seen that the HER performance of MoP@PCC showed lower overpotential in alkaline solution than acidic solution because more active sites of MoP@PCC are exposed due to the dissolution of the oxidized MoOx in the alkaline solution [36,37]. In addition, Tafel plots exhibited a similar tendency in alkaline and neutral solutions. MoP NPs showed high Tafel slopes of 131 (in alkaline solution) and 123 mV dec−1 (in neutral solution), while low Tafel slopes of 60 (in alkaline) and 68 mV dec−1 in MoP@PCC, which indicates that HER mechanism of MoP NPs and MoP@PCC is followed by Volmer and Heyrovsky reaction process, respectively [38]. It is known that the additional water dissociation process (H2O → H+ + OH−) is essential in the Volmer reaction step in alkaline solution [39]. In the case of MoP NPs, due to their severe aggregation of nanoparticles, it seems that there are insufficient active sites to induce water dissociation. But, MoP@PCC, which MoP NPs are uniformly distributed on the PCC, could retain enough active sites in order to induce water dissociation, thus MoP@PCC follows Heyrovsky reaction and rate-determining step (RDS) is an electrochemical desorption process. Likewise, the water dissociation process is also required in a neutral solution, so it exhibits a similar tendency as in alkaline solutions. On the other hand, both MoP NPs and MoP@PCC showed a similar Tafel slope of 65–75 mV dec−1 (Fig. S13), indicates that Heyrovsky reaction is RDS. Even if there are insufficient active sites on MoP, the electrochemical adsorption of hydrogen ion is not the RDS because the water dissociation process is not required in an acidic solution. We further investigated the stability of the MoP@PCC-600 electrocatalyst after the CV tests in alkaline and neutral solutions. As shown by the XRD patterns (Fig. 5 a), all the reflected peaks in the two patterns were consistent with the MoP reference data without any secondary peak, indicating the high microstructural stability of MoP@PCC-600 during the electrocatalytic tests in alkaline and neutral solutions. Moreover, the chemical states of the surface of MoP@PCC-600 were identified by XPS analysis. All the survey spectra exhibited Mo 3d, Mo 3p, P 2p, P 2s, and O 1s bands, corresponding to MoP (Fig. S15). Further, Mo 3d and P 2p XPS spectra were analyzed between 240 and 225 eV and between 140 and 125 eV, respectively (Fig. 5b and c). For the fresh MoP@PCC-600, the Mo 3d spectrum was deconvoluted into three pairs of core-level peaks at 230.9/227.8, 232.4/229.1, and 235.4/232.8 eV, corresponding to the Mo 3d5/2/3d3/2 of Mo–P, Mo4+–O and Mo6+–O bindings, respectively [40,41]. The P 2p spectrum of MoP@PCC-600 exhibited two peaks at 130.2/129.3 eV and one at 133.6 eV, corresponding to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of P–Mo binding and POx species, respectively [20,42]. The Mo–O and POx peaks were attributed to partial oxidation resulting from exposure to air [20,43]. Interestingly, there was no significant change in the chemical states after the electrocatalytic tests in the alkaline and neutral solutions. Mo–P binding peaks were clearly observed in the Mo 3d and P 2p spectra, while the intensity of the Mo–O binding peak did not significantly increase. Therefore, it can be said that the XRD and XPS analyses revealed the high electrocatalytic stability and durability of MoP@PCC."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, we have developed a new synthetic strategy for the fabrication of MoP@PCC electrocatalysts through the dip-coating of MoO2 NPs on PCC and the subsequent phosphidation process. The uniform coating and distribution of the ultrafine MoO2 NPs on PCC could inhibit MoP NPs from aggregating after thermal phosphidation. MoP@PCC exhibited good electrocatalytic activity toward HER over a wide pH range, especially in alkaline and neutral solutions because MoP@PCC possessed a larger ECSA and facilitated faster electron transfer, compared to MoP NPs. Furthermore, MoP NPs exhibited high microstructural and chemical stabilities while still agglomerating on the surface of PCC, even after continuous CV tests. This confirms its long-term durability after a chronopotentiometric test over 50 h. Therefore, this study offers a novel strategy for the design of noble metal–free nano-electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production in different pH environments."
