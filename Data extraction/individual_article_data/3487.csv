0,INTRODUCTION,"The future of chemistry involves environmentally friendly products, sustainable energy, and green and efficient chemical processes. Heterogeneous visible light photocatalysts play the main role in the present and the future due to having advantages such as being clean, cost-effective, efficient, and a power-saving ability [1–3]. In a common photocatalytic process, the generation of electron-hole (ē -h+) pairs by phenomenon irradiation on semiconductor materials is indispensable [4]. Photocatalysts have been designed for a variety of oxidation and reduction reactions under light irradiation owing to physicochemical, optical, and electrical properties [5–7]. Also, the photocatalytic technique is considered as a creative approach to convert and store renewable energy for numerous purposes ranging from producing sustainable and green energy to environmental applications [8–12]. As a phenomenal conjugated polymer, g-C3N4 has become a new field of research and attracted wide interdisciplinary attention. It is a well-known material in the arena of renewable energy, environmental protection, Friedel-Crafts reactions, oxygen reduction, and water splitting reactions [13–16]. This is due to its unique electronic structure, being metal-free, high physicochemical stability, and “earth-abundant” nature [17]. Extensive research on g-C3N4 emerged from Liu and Cohen’s prediction that carbon nitride can be a specific material [18]. Its distinguished stability and chemical resistance have been reported by Gillan [19]. Its preparation and applications have been summarized by Zhou in 2017 [20]. Nevertheless, because of the limited surface area and high recombination rate of electron-hole pairs, the application of g-C3N4 is not optimal. To tackle this issue, a nanocomposite of g-C3N4 and metal oxide can be employed to improve the surface area of the photocatalyst and modify the separation of electron-hole pairs. Among semiconductor photocatalysts, TiO2 is the most popular one which is utilized in heterogeneous photocatalytic processes due to its stable physicochemical property, nontoxicity, and low cost [21,22]. Selective oxidation of alcohols leads to greater value-added products such as aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids which is of paramount importance in laboratories and industries [23–25]. The study on benzaldehyde as one of the most valuable products for the industrial synthesis of bulk chemicals has been practicable in dyeing, perfumery, and pharmaceutical industries [26–29]. However, the common methods of commercial alcohol oxidation have obvious drawbacks including toxicity, corrosion, expensive oxidant, harsh reaction conditions (high temperature and high pressure), and using strong mineral acids [30–32]. Consequently, designing an efficient, environmentally friendly and safe method for the industrial production of benzaldehyde under moderate conditions is very important. In the present study, we have prepared a structurally optimized g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite using the spray-drying technique, which is an efficient industrial method for production of various nanocomposites with a spherical morphology and a narrow distribution of particle size [33]. Then, the nanocomposites were used as a photocatalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde for the first time."
1,EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS,
2,Characterizations,2.1 Characterizations See the Supporting Information.
3,Preparation of g-C3N4 Nanosheets,"2.2 Preparation of g-C3N4 Nanosheets Bulk g-C3N4 (CN) was synthesized by a simple pyrolysis method. At first, 30 g urea was placed in an alumina crucible with a lid, then annealed at 550 °C for 3 h at a ramp rate of 9 °C/min in air. The resulting pale powder was then dispersed in 50 mL ethanol under 400 Watt ultrasound for 4 h. Finally, the white color suspension was collected by centrifuge at 6000 rpm to remove unreacted chemicals, followed dried under vacuum to obtain g-C3N4 nanosheets."
4,Preparation of g-C3N4/TiO2 Nanocomposite,2.3 Preparation of g-C3N4/TiO2 Nanocomposite g-C3N4/TiO2 (TCN) nanocomposite was synthesized as follows: 1.5 mL TiCl4 was added to a flask containing 30 mL toluene and stirred for 15 min. 1 g of g-C3N4 was then added to the solution and sonicated for 2 h. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 110 °C for 8 h. The prepared nanocomposite powders were washed three times with EtOH to remove the unreacted organic residues prior to drying at 70 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven.
5,Preparation of Spray-Dried g-C3N4/TiO2 Granules (TCNg),"2.4 Preparation of Spray-Dried g-C3N4/TiO2 Granules (TCNg) A mixture of the nanocomposite, deionized water, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 2 wt% to nanocomposite weight) was stirred for 3 h. The resultant suspension was spray-dried using inlet and outlet temperatures of 180 and 150 °C, respectively. To remove the PVA content, the obtained powder was calcined at 550 °C in air. (see Scheme S1 in the supporting information)"
6,Experimental Procedure for the Photocatalytic Oxidation Reactions,"2.5 Experimental Procedure for the Photocatalytic Oxidation Reactions The photocatalytic oxidation reaction was carried out with an O2 atmosphere under visible light irradiation as follows: 1 mmol benzyl alcohol, 10 mL acetonitrile, and 50 mg photocatalytic (TCNg) were mixed in a Pyrex reaction cell. The reaction was performed at ambient pressure under different reaction conditions including reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, solvents, and catalyst loading using a 400 W Xe lamp without a cut-off filter. After the irradiation, the suspension was collected, centrifuged, and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. Finally, the conversion and selectivity of each reaction were estimated by GC-MS."
7,RESULTS AND DISSCUSION,
8,IR Spectroscopic Study,"3.1 IR Spectroscopic Study The FTIR spectra of all samples are shown in Fig. 1 . The absorption bands between 1200-1650 cm-1 are attributed to the vibrations of the C–N and C = N bonds as reported earlier [34]. Additionally, the band at 808 cm-1 shows the out-of-plane breathing modes of triazine rings [35]. The nearly similar IR spectra in Fig. 1 indicate that the surface functional groups of g-C3N4 are well maintained even after the spray-drying and calcination processes. The FTIR spectra of TCN and TCNg also show the broad absorption bands at 400–700 cm−1 related to the stretching vibrations of Ti–O–Ti and Ti–O in the anatase crystalline phase [36]. As mentioned above, the bands in the region 1150 − 1650 and 808 cm-1 are attributed to the stretching vibration modes and out-of-plane bending modes of triazine. The broad bands between 3100-3450 cm-1 are assigned to the N–H stretches which originate from the efficient hydrogenation of the nitrogen atoms in the nanosheets [37]. The results indicate the main characteristic bands of g-C3N4 and TiO2."
9,Photoluminescence analysis,"3.2 Photoluminescence analysis The photoluminescence spectra of CN, CNg, TCN, and TCNg are shown in Fig. 2 . To record the emission spectra, the samples were excited with 325 nm wavelength. It is found that the photoluminescence signals of the prepared nanocomposites originate from electron-hole charge recombination in g-C3N4. As expected, the pure g-C3N4 sample exhibited strong photoluminescence signals ranging from 400 − 600 nm. The maximum emission intensity was observed at 458 nm which is because of the rapid recombination rate of the photo-generated electron and hole in the irradiated g-C3N4 sample. The photoluminescence signal position of the g-C3N4 nanocomposites depends on the synthesis conditions [38]. Furthermore, the lower peak intensity of the photoluminescence emission is originated from the electrons-holes transfer between TiO2 and g-C3N4 [39,40]. A significant decrease in the photoluminescence intensity of g-C3N4 was observed with increasing the TiO2 loading [41]."
10,XRD analyses,"3.3 XRD analyses The X-ray diffraction patterns of CN, CNg, TCN, and TCNg are shown in Fig. 3 . The CN and CNg diffraction patterns display two peaks corresponding to the similar atomic structure of g-C3N4. Both CN and CNg samples show a diffraction line at 2θ = 13.1° corresponding to the crystal plane (100) of tri-s-triazine [42]. The strong picks at 2θ = 27.38 and 27.73° are attributed to the (002) plane of the inter-planar stacking of the aromatic systems CN and CNg, respectively [43,44]. The presence of the anatase phase of TiO2 in the XRD patterns of TCN and TCNg can be confirmed by the peaks at 25.2, 36.95, 37.85, 38.35, 48.1°,54.1, 55.2, 62.7, 69.4, 70.5, and 74.9° corresponding to the crystal planes (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (206), and (116) [45]. The results reveal that the added g-C3N4 does not influence the configuration of TiO2. Due to the widening and overlapping of the main peaks, the XRD pattern of g-C3N4 is not distinguishable. The average crystallite size was calculated using the Debye-Scherrer formula, which is 32 nm for TiO2 on the spray-dried g-C3N4 granules [46]."
11,Electron microscopy studies,"3.4 Electron microscopy studies To investigate the nanocomposite structures, SEM images of CN, CNg, TCN, and TCNg, as well as TEM images of TCNg were recorded. The SEM image of the pure CN (Fig. 4 a) consists of measurable stacking sheets in the nanometric scale. Fig. 4b and c, show the structure of the CNg sample, which is achieved by the spray-drying technique. The sheet-like morphology has become spherical and according to the particle size distribution histogram (see Figure S1 in the supporting information), most of the particles are 4 μm. As shown in Fig. 4d, the surface morphology of the TCN sample has not changed. Due to Fig. 4e and f, it is possible to infer the spherical and uniform distribution with certainty for the TCNg sample. Additional SEM images of the nanocomposites are available in the supplementary information, Figure S2. To confirm that the TiO2 is firmly fixed on the surface of g-C3N4, element mappings of the TCNg nanocomposites were taken and the results are demonstrated in Fig. 5 . The elemental mappings of pure g-C3N4 are shown in Figure S3 in the supporting information. The results indicate that the N, C, O, and Ti atoms regularly distribute on the surface of the nanocomposite, which strongly confirms the uniform distribution of TiO2 and g-C3N4 even in the outer edge of the nanocomposite. Also, due to the limited magnification of SEM, the TEM images and the histogram of the TCNg particle size distributions are presented in Fig. 6 . The particle size of TiO2 on the spray-dried g-C3N4 granules is about 30 nm. Moreover, the mean particle size is close to the average particle size of the XRD pattern. Similar results can be proved by comparing these figures with the SEM images. The g-C3N4 sample is composed of stacking thin sheets with a smooth surface. Therefore, it is obvious that the surface of g-C3N4 is full of ultra-small TiO2 nanoparticles. The TEM image of g-C3N4/TiO2 is shown in Figure S4 in the supporting information."
12,Nitrogen adsorption analysis,"3.5 Nitrogen adsorption analysis The specific surface area, pore size, and pore volume of the photocatalysts were determined using BET analysis by nitrogen adsorption-desorption at 77 K. The adsorption-desorption isotherm of CN, CNg, TCN, and TCNg are presented in Fig. 7 , which the insets present the result of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) analysis of the pore distribution in the samples. The hysteresis loop at a relative pressure from 0.4 to 0.8 is associated with the aggregated pores of g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposites, while the hysteresis loop in the high-pressure region from 0.8 to 0.95 is closely related to the larger pores in the structures [47]. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (SBET), pore sizes, and pore volumes of the samples are summarized in Table 1 . According to the IUPAC classification, the isotherms of all samples are type IV, which are related to the mesoporous solids [48]."
13,Optical properties,"3.6 Optical properties The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were carried out to measure the electronic band gap by converting reflectance to absorption. As shown in Fig. 8 , the absorption edge of TCN, TCNg, CN, and CNg are found at 410, 418, 456, and 465 nm, respectively. The CN and CNg photocatalysts exhibit natural semiconductor-like absorptions in the blue region (visible light). After combining g-C3N4 with TiO2, the optical absorption of the composite samples is slightly decreased [49]. The decrease in the band gap caused by carbon doping extends the absorption to a longer wavelength [44]. Furthermore, the band gaps of the samples were obtained by the utilization of the Kubelka-Munk algorithm [50]."
14,Photocatalytic oxidation activity,"3.7 Photocatalytic oxidation activity The visible-light photocatalytic activity of as-prepared photocatalysts was evaluated for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAL). The photocatalytic reactions were run in a Pyrex reaction cell under the irradiation of a 400 W Xe lamp in the presence of molecular oxygen as the oxidant. The reaction conversion and selectivity were monitored by GC-MS. The oxidation reaction conditions were optimized by the investigation on the influence of reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, solvent, reaction time, and catalyst loading. The summary of the results is shown in Table 2 (also see Figure S5 in the supporting information for more details). Furthermore, TCNg was reused for five consecutive cycles in the catalytic oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol. The catalyst exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity and excellent recyclability and stability. The results show that the selectivity is constant, and the conversion is decreased by less than 7.0 % (Fig. 9 )."
15,Theoretical results,"3.8 Theoretical results To compare the energy gap of TiO2, g-C3N4, and g-C3N4/TiO2 systems with each other, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals were calculated for each system. To model the g-C3N4/TiO2 system, the TiO2 nanoparticles were considered as Ti6O8(OH)8 clusters immobilized on the surface of g-C3N4. A monolayer of g-C3N4 containing six heptazine units was selected to model the g-C3N4 layer. The density functional tight-binding (DFTB+) method implemented in the Material Studio software was used for the calculations [51]. The trans3d Slater-Koster library was used for all pair interactions in the systems [52,53]. The tolerance of the energy convergence was set to 0.01 kcal mol-1, 0.1 kcal mol-1 Å-1, and 0.001 Å-1 for displacement. The value of the self-consistent charge tolerance was 10-8 a.u elementary charge. The structures of g-C3N4 and Ti6O8(OH)8 cluster were separately optimized. The optimized structure of the selected g-C3N4 has a capacity for the immobilization of four Ti6O8(OH)8 clusters. The optimized structures of g-C3N4/TiO2 composed of four Ti6O8(OH)8 clusters interacting with the g-C3N4 layer, a clean g-C3N4 layer, and four Ti6O8(OH)8 clusters ((Ti6O8(OH)8)4) interacting with each other are shown in Fig. 10 . The calculated shapes of HOMO and LUMO of clean g-C3N4, (Ti6O8(OH)8)4, and g-C3N4/(Ti6O8(OH)8)4 are shown in Fig. 11 . The HOMO of g-C3N4/(Ti6O8(OH)8)4 is related to its g-C3N4 part because of the presence of the electron density on this part, while its LUMO is localized on (Ti6O8(OH)8)4 and causes a decrease of the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO in this system compared to the isolated g-C3N4 and (Ti6O8(OH)8)4. Therefore, the HOMO to LUMO electron excitation in g-C3N4/(Ti6O8(OH)8)4 is equivalent to the electron transition from the HOMO of g-C3N4 to the LUMO of (Ti6O8(OH)8)4. The calculated value of the energy gap of the isolated (Ti6O8(OH)8)4 and g-C3N4 is 3.4 and 2.78 eV, which is close to their experimental values (3.22 and 2.72 eV, respectively) obtained in this work [13,54]. The calculated energy gap for g-C3N4/(Ti6O8(OH)8)4 is 2.51 eV, which shows the effect of g-C3N4 as a substrate in reducing the energy gap in this system compared to the isolated (Ti6O8(OH)8)4 clusters. The localization of electron density in the LUMO of g-C3N4/(Ti6O8(OH)8)4 on its (Ti6O8(OH)8)4 part causes the decrease of the recombination of electron-hole compared to the pure g-C3N4 and (Ti6O8(OH)8)4 systems. This factor, along with the decrease of the energy gap of g-C3N4/(Ti6O8(OH)8)4, increases the photocatalytic activity compared to the pure ones."
16,CONCLUSIONS,"In this research, g-C3N4-based nanocomposites were synthesized from the simple pyrolysis process of urea and TiCl4 as the precursors. The nanocomposites were used for the selective oxidation of BA to BLA. The aim of the current study was to convert benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with a high conversion rate and high selectivity without the need to design a complex reactor system and without the use of high pressure O2. Among the photocatalysts, TCNg was used for the first time and the results indicated that TCNg has higher surface area, a spherical morphology, and narrower band gap in comparison with initial TCN. This photocatalyst also exhibits greater effectiveness, conversion (72%), and selectivity (100%) with a TOF of 550 h-1 for the oxidation of BA to BLA under visible light irradiation. The prepared photocatalyst, TCNg, is stable and can be reused up to 5 consecutive runs. The results indicated that the granulation process increases the efficiency and repeatability of the photocatalyst."
