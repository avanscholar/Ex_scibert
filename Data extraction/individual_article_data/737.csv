0,Introduction,"With the development of human society, environmental pollution and energy crises have become two major problems that must be solved immediately. Hydrogen energy is a clean energy that has been widely studied by researchers. Photocatalytic water splitting is considered to be one of the most promising green technologies for producing hydrogen [1,2]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely used in the study of photocatalytic hydrogen production because of its advantages, including its good chemical stability, non-toxicity and low cost [3–7]. Unfortunately, due to its large energy bandwidth (~3.2 eV), TiO2 can only be excited by ultraviolet light in solar energy, which greatly limits its practical applications [8,9]. Therefore, it is very important to broaden the visible absorption capacity of TiO2. Much research has been conducted on methods such as hybridization, recombination and others to increase the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 with visible light. Among them, building a heterojunction between TiO2 and other semiconductors with a low band gap is considered to be an effective method, and some of the progress has been made [10–12]. This progress has played a significant role in improving the visible light activity of and inhibiting the recombination rate of electron-hole (e−-h+) pairs in catalytic composite materials [12,13] and in promoting the commercialization of TiO2 photocatalysis. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted much attention because of its unique electronic structure and excellent catalytic performance [6,14,15]. The g–C3N4–based materials have been widely used in the field of photocatalysis due to their good chemical and physical stability, facile preparation, and wide resources [16,17]. It has a narrow band gap of ~2.8 eV with strong visible light absorption capability, resulting in a good photocatalytic performance driven by sunlight. This compound can form a composite with TiO2 to overcome the inherent weakness of TiO2. TiO2/g-C3N4 composite exhibits a better performance than the two individual materials as the e−-h+ separation is improved by the suitable coupling at the interface between TiO2 and g-C3N4 [18–20]. However, during the construction of heterojunctions of TiO2/g-C3N4, the surfaces of the TiO2 particles are often modified by g-C3N4 in a point-to-point (0d-0d) manner, or the particles are landed on the g-C3N4 with a lamellar structure (0d-2d) [21–23]. These effects could affect the proper interface contact between TiO2 and g-C3N4 for the construction type II or Z-scheme of traditional heterojunctions. These structures have longer paths for photogenerated charges to travel from the inside to the surface of the catalyst [24]. For achieving good catalytic performance for the composite catalysts, good interface contact between materials must be effective enough for good electrons transfer at the interface. The study of photocatalysts with 3D hierarchical structures has also attracted extensive interest. Due to the possible multiple light reflections and refractions within the intricate nanostructures, the light absorption efficiency can be improved [25–27]. Numerous of diverse morphologies have developed for the TiO2/g-C3N4 composite. The flower-like structure is considered to be the preferred framework with appropriate heterojunctions. It has not only the advantages of enhancing light scattering and absorption, but also a large specific surface area with high density of active sites [26,28,29]. Also, it is realityly easy to form the traditional type II heterojunction for most of TiO2/g-C3N4 composites. In this structure, photoexcited electrons are readily transferred within the CBs from g-C3N4 to TiO2, whereas the holes are automatically transferred in the VBs from TiO2 to g-C3N4 [30,31]. However, this type of heterojunction suffers from the decrease of the electron reduction potential once they are transferred cross the interface, determined by the energy differences of CBs. Using a Z-scheme heterostructure can overcome this problem, since it normally involves two photons in an excitation process absorbed between three materials. A direct Z heterojunction requires good interface contact to facilitate both the electron and hole transferring to different materials, which plays a crucial role in the improving of charge transfer and separation [32]. Although Z-scheme heterojunctions have many advantages over traditional heterojunctions, limited achievements have been made in the research process. Meanwhile, current heterogeneous junctions constructed by TiO2/g-C3N4 composite materials are focused in the structural design of 0D-0D and 0D-2D, which leads to insufficiently interface contact and inefficient in photoenergy conversion. Hence it is necessary to develop new composite nanomaterials to overcome the problems. In this work, a 3D camellia-like NH4TiOF3/TiO2/g-C3N4 heterostructure was constructed by a convenient method. The 3D hierarchical structure of the composite material and the rough surface of NH4TiOF3 enabled multiple refractions and reflections of light inside the catalyst, which greatly improved the utilization of sunlight. The Z-scheme heterostructures constructed from g-C3N4, NH4TiOF3 and TiO2 also enabled a better electron reduction performance. It was unexpectedly found that the nitrogen in g-C3N4 could be converted to the nitrogen in NH4TiOF3, and the possible reaction process for this change was discussed. The microstructure and physicochemical properties of the composite were studied. The results revealed a strong synergistic coupling effect at the interface. Photoluminescence, photocurrent and bandwidth studies indicated that the successful construction of the 3D camellia-like heterostructure greatly improved the utilization of light. The results provide an effective method for preparing high-performance photocatalytic materials for hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Urea (AR), isopropyl alcohol (AR), triethanolamine (AR) and hydrofluoric acid (40%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Tetrabutyl titanate (99%) and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (AR) were obtained from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. All the purchased chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Preparation of the photocatalyst,"2.2 Preparation of the photocatalyst A common method for preparing g-C3N4 was used. Briefly, 10 g urea was placed in a 30 ml alumina crucible, and the crucible was covered with aluminium foil paper. After placing it in a muffle furnace, the urea in the alumina crucible was heated from ambient temperature to 550 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and then kept at 550 °C for 4 h. Afterwards, the muffle furnace was cooled naturally, and g-C3N4 was obtained. The g-C3N4 prepared in the previous step (0.1 g) was weighed and ground into a fine powder using an agate mortar for 30 min. The ground g-C3N4 powder was added to a 40 ml isopropanol solution in a glass bottle, and the mixture in the glass bottle was ultrasonically dispersed in a 300 W ultrasonic cleaner for 4 h. A measured amount of butyl titanate (TBOT) and 0.5 ml of hydrofluoric acid (HF) were added to the mixture, which was then stirred for 30 min. The mixture was subsequently transferred to a 50 ml hydrothermal reactor to undergo a hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 12 h. After cooling and filtering, the sample was washed repeatedly with ethanol and deionized water. Finally, the washed product was dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 24 h to obtain the catalytic composite sample. The prepared NH4TiOF3/g-C3N4/TiO2 photocatalysts were named NTF/gCN/TO-X (X = 1, 2, 3, 4) according to the amount of TBOT added (0.35, 0.7, 1.05, 1.4 ml). For comparison, the samples were prepared without g-C3N4 by adding different amounts of TBOT (0.35, 0.7, 1.05, 1.4 ml) and 0.5 ml hydrofluoric acid (HF) to 40 ml isopropanol and following the same hydrothermal treatment procedure as described above. The samples were subjected to washing, filtration and drying. A titanium dioxide sample (TiO2) was only collected when 1.4 ml TBOT was added. The preparation process of the catalyst is shown in Fig. 1 ."
4,Characterization and photocatalytic activity analysis methods,"2.3 Characterization and photocatalytic activity analysis methods The crystal phases of the catalyst samples were identified using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (D/max2550pc, PIGAKV Co., Ltd.) at a scanning step length of 0.02 in the scanning range from 10° to 80° with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The surface morphology and chemical element distribution of the catalysts were characterized using a spherical difference transmission electron microscope (TEM, Titan G2 60-300, USA), scanning electron microscope (SEM, Helios Nanolab G3 UC, FEI) and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) attached to the SEM instrument. The chemical composition and bonding energy of the sample powder were measured using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (K-ALPHA, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Electrochemical analysis was performed using a CHI660C electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China) equipped with a three-electrode electrochemical cell. A catalyst sample with an effective area of 1.0 cm2 was used as the working electrode. A platinum wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was a 0.5 Na2SO4 (pH = 7) solution. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (f7000, Hitachi, Japan, EX WL 320 nm, EM start WL 350 nm, EM end WL 600 nm, EX slit 1.0 nm, EM slit 2.5 nm) was used to measure the emission intensity of the sample fluorescence. A UV–visible near-infrared diffuse reflection spectrometer (UV–vis–NIR DRS, Cary 5000, Agilent Technologies, Malaysia) was employed to measure the UV–visible spectra of the samples. The scanning wavelength was 300–800 nm. The photocatalytic activities of the catalysts were tested in a photocatalytic reactor (LABSOLAR-H2, Beijing Perfect Technology Co., Ltd., China). In each test, 13.5 mg of the catalyst sample, 8 ml of triethanolamine (TEOA) and 0.08 ml of an H2PtCl6 (25 mmol/l) aqueous solution were added to 72 ml of deionized water, and the mixture was then dispersed by ultrasound for 30 min using an ultrasonic bath. The mixture was kept at a temperature of 5 °C and irradiated with a xenon lamp (300 W), and the quantity of the escaping gas was measured by gas chromatography."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM were used to confirm the formation of heterogeneous structures and observe the morphological characteristics of the surfaces of the prepared catalyst samples. The XRD patterns of g-C3N4, TiO2 and NTF/gCN/TO-X (X = 1, 2, 3, 4) are shown in Fig. 2 . The diffraction pattern of g-C3N4 exhibits two diffraction peaks at 13.1° and 27.6°. The weak peak at 13.1° corresponds to the (100) plane, which is related to the in-plane structural stacking motif of the triazine unit with a crystal plane spacing of d = 0.645 nm [33]. The diffraction peak at 27.6° is related to the (002) diffraction surface of the material, which is attributed to the characteristic interlayer stacking structure of the aromatic segment with a distance of d = 0.323 nm. It is difficult to observe the characteristic peaks of the g-C3N4 (100) plane in the composite materials, which is attributed to its poor crystallinity. When the amount of TBOT is 0.35 ml, the characteristic absorption peaks of NH4TiOF3 can be observed at 13.7°, 23.6°, 27.5°, 33.8° and 41.9° and correspond to the (002), (020), (211), (220) and (025) crystal faces of NH4TiOF3, respectively. This result is consistent with data reported in literature [34]. With increasing TBOT, the diffraction intensity of NH4TiOF3 decreases, and the diffraction peaks of TiO2 increase. The enhancement in the peaks due to the (101), (004), (200), (211) and (204) crystal faces of anatase titanium dioxide are observed at 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.0°, 55.0° and 62.7° [35]. The formation process of the catalysts is described and understood as follows, (1) g-C3N4+12HF+4Ti(-OR)4+4H2O = 4NH4TiOF3+3C(-OR)4+4R–OH (2) NH4TiOF3+H2OTiO2+NH3+3HF where R = -C4H9. When the amount of TBOT is insufficient (e.g., X = 1, TBOT: 0.35 ml), the reaction between TBOT and g-C3N4 generates NH4TiOF3. The phase composition consists of the newly generated NH4TiOF3 and the incompletely reacted g-C3N4, which can be verified by the XRD pattern of NTF/gCN/TO-1. In this case, no TiO2 diffraction peaks are observed, indicating that the NH4TiOF3 generated by the reaction is a stable phase under this reaction condition. With increasing TBOT addition, some NH4TiOF3 is hydrolysed to TiO2, the intensities of the diffraction peaks of NH4TiOF3 become lower, and the characteristic peak of TiO2 appears and increases, as shown by the XRD results of the NTF/gCN/TO-2 and NTF/gCN/TO-3 samples. This change in the XRD intensity is consistent with the results of the comparative test and literature data [36]. The hydrolysis of NH4TiOF3 to form TiO2 reduces the amount of NH4TiOF3, as shown in equation. As TBOT continuously increases, the diffraction intensity of TiO2 also increases, and at the same time, the XRD intensity of NH4TiOF3 continues to weaken. This trend is clearly shown in the XRD pattern of NTF/gCN/TO-4 in Fig. 2. The continuous consumption of NH4TiOF3 promotes reaction 1, causing a decrease in the amount of g-C3N4 and therefore a reduction in its diffraction intensity. To further understand the chemical composition of the composite, a typical sample was analysed by XPS, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 a–f. As shown in the survey spectrum (Fig. 3a), only five chemical elements are detected in the representative NTF/gCN/TO-3 sample. These elements are C, N, O, Ti and F, and their contents (atomic %) are 24.46%, 11.60%, 37.01%, 15.34% and 11.58%, respectively. It should be noted that a considerable amount of F is observed on the sample surface. Fig. 3b shows the presence of three peaks in the C 1s spectrum positioned at approximately 288.6 eV, 286.4 eV and 284.8 eV. The characteristic peak with a lower binding energy at 284.8 eV is attributed to sp2 carbon in g-C3N4, which is consistent with data reported in the literature [37]. The two peaks at 286.4 eV and 288.6 eV are attributed to organic C–O and the sp3 carbon in the N–C–N chain [38]. Four characteristic peaks can be observed at 398.9 eV, 399.4 eV, 400.1 eV and 401.6 eV in the high-resolution N 1s spectra and are derived from the contributions of N–CN, N-(C)3, TiO–N and N-Hx [39]. The peak positions of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 in the high-resolution Ti 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 3d) can be determined. They are located at 464.7 eV and 459.0 eV, respectively. The 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks are separated by 5.7 eV, which is a feature of TiO2 that indicates the presence of Ti4+ [40]. The high-resolution O 1s peak at 530.2 eV is assigned to O1 in anatase TiO2, the second peak at 531.7 eV is identified as N–Ti–O or CO, and the peak at 532.4 eV is attributed to surface adsorbed water [41]. The contribution observed at 685.3 eV in the high-resolution F 1s spectrum corresponds to the Ti–F bond in NH4TiOF3, and that at 684.4 eV corresponds to NH4–F [42]. Fig. 4 shows SEM and elemental mapping images of the NTF/gCN/TO-3 sample. The micromorphological characteristics of the whole sample can be observed in Fig. 4a. The flower structure of titanium dioxide is formed by stacking the lamellar structure. The diameter of each flower is approximately 1–2 μm, and the surface of the petals is NH4TiOF3. This surface layer is clearly shown in Fig. 4b. The energy spectrum analysis also confirms that the whole sample is rich in Ti and O, has a uniform distribution of N and F and contains a small amount of C, indicating that the flower structure is mainly composed of TiO2 and NH4TiOF3, with NH4TiOF3 evenly distributed on the lamellar structure of titanium dioxide. TiO2 is formed from NH4TiOF3 by the hydrothermal reaction; therefore, NH4TiOF3 is evenly distributed around TiO2 and the surface becomes rough. The flakes of g-C3N4 can be seen in the gap between titanium dioxide and the gCN flowers and are identified by the carbon elemental distribution and XRD. The microstructure of the samples was characterized by TEM and HRTEM. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . In the camellia-like structure, TiO2 and NH4TiOF3 are successfully anchored to the g-C3N4 lamellar structure, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. The petals are mainly composed of titanium dioxide with the anatase structure, and the crystal plane spacing of d = 0.35 nm corresponds to the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2 [43], as shown in Figs. 4c and 5d. Fig. 5e and f shows that NH4TiOF3 is distributed in the upper part of the TiO2 laminar structure, and the crystal plane spacing of 0.38 nm corresponds to the NH4TiOF3 (020) crystal plane [44]. Due to the poor crystallinity of g-C3N4, the lattice fringes of g-C3N4 are not observed, which is consistent with the XRD results."
7,Optical absorption properties,"3.2 Optical absorption properties The photoelectric chemical characteristics of the composite were tested, as shown in Fig. 6 a g-C3N4 exhibits a high fluorescence emission peak at 350–600 nm, and the high PL strength indicates that the e−-h+ pairs have a fast recombination rate. The PL strength of pure g-C3N4 is the highest, which means that the e−-h+ pairs of g-C3N4 can easily and quickly recombine, which is unfavourable for the catalytic effect. When NH4TiOF3 and g-C3N4 are combined in the NTF/gCN/TO-1 sample, the photoluminescence intensity is weakened. Therefore, the introduction of NH4TiOF3 inhibits the recombination rate of the photogenic carriers. The PL spectrum of the NTF/gCN/TO-3 and NTF/gCN/TO-4 samples show that the PL intensity decreases further with the formation of TiO2. This result shows that the PL strength of the composite material is greatly reduced by NH4TiOF3 and TiO2. The presence of NH4TiOF3 and TiO2 effectively suppresses e−-h+ pairs in the composite material, leading to the more effective separation of photoexcited e−'s, which plays a key role in the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production. To determine the effect of the heteropair band gap formed by NH4TiOF3, TiO2 and g-C3N4, the UV-vis-NIR-DRS spectra of the composite materials were measured, as shown in Fig. 6b and c shows the results obtained by estimating the band gap of the sample using the Kubelka Munk function. The band gap width of g-C3N4 is approximately 2.8 eV, and that of TiO2 is ~3.2 eV. Only ultraviolet light, which constitutes a small portion of sunlight, can stimulate the electrons in TiO2 to transition from the valence band (VB) (O 2p) to the conduction band (CB) (Ti 3d). The formation of a heterojunction structure between g-C3N4 and TiO2 results in a bandwidth of 2.8–2.9 eV for the composite materials of NTF/gCN/TO-3, enabling light absorption further into the visible region. For a composite material, the narrower band gap indicates that the formation of heterojunctions enables electron excitation with lower energy and more visible light can be used in the reaction with much-improved efficiency of sunlight utilization. Such property is essential for composite photocatalysts. In the NTF/gCN/TO-4, excess TiO2 will affect the utilization of visible sunlight. Hence, the appropriate composition of g-C3N4 and TiO2 in the composite materials is necessary for the performance of photocatalysis."
8,Photocatalytic performance,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance To determine the effects of the composite heterojunction structure on the photocatalytic hydrogen production of the samples, the catalytic hydrogen production capacity of the samples was tested under simulated sunlight. For comparison, the g-C3N4 and TiO2 samples were also tested under the same conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 7 a g-C3N4 had a low hydrogen production rate of 0.9 mmol/g/h, due to the rapid combination of e−-h+ pairs. TiO2 also had a relatively low hydrogen production rate of 1.7 mmol/g/h, because TiO2 can only utilize ultraviolet light, which is less than 5% of sunlight. With increasing TBOT dosage, the hydrogen production rate of the composite samples improved greatly. For example, when the TBOT dosage was 1.05 ml, the hydrogen production rate of the NTF/gCN/TO-3 sample reached a maximum value of 3.6 mmol/g/h, which was 4.0 and 2.1 times higher than those of pure g-C3N4 and TiO2. This result was very exciting. This result can be explained by three main factors: first, the construction of the heterojunction can effectively prevent the rapid combination of e−-h+ pairs, as clearly observed in the PL test results. Second, the 3D camellia-like structure composed of NH4TiOF3 and TiO2, which is observed by scanning electron microscopy, can give rise to multiple reflections and refractions in the rough petals to improve the light utilization rate. Finally, the formation of a high-quality interface between NH4TiOF3, TiO2 and g-C3N4, as shown in the TEM image, facilitates efficient charge separation and transmission. However, with increasing TBOT, the hydrogen production rate of NTF/gCN/TO-4 decreased to 2.8 mmol/g/h, mainly due to the continuous consumption of g-C3N4 and therefore reduction in the utilization rate of visible light. At the same time, for the optimized reaction, NH4TiOF3 is basically converted to TiO2, and the interface effect of NH4TiOF3 is weakened. Therefore, it is important to construct composite materials with an optimized heterojunction, high-quality interface and appropriate phase proportions. Even the lowest hydrogen production rate of NTF/gCN/TO-4 is obviously better than those of pure g-C3N4 and TiO2, which further proves the effectiveness of the heterogeneous structure. As a photocatalyst, the composite materials must exhibit not only high catalytic activity but also good stability, especially in practical applications. The cycling stability of the composite material was tested five times under sunlight, and the results are shown in Fig. 7b. After 5 cycles, no significant decrease in the hydrogen production rate was observed for NTF/gCN/TO-3 after 25 h accumulation, demonstrating the excellent stability of the composite. The performance of H2 production over g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 photocatalyst was compared with the literature results, summarised in Table 1 . For instance, the 2D-montmorillonite-dispersed g-C3N4/TiO2 2D/0D nanocomposite offered 2213 μmol/g/h of H2 production rate from a glycerol-water mixture [24]. The addition of 1 wt % Pt to the g-C3N4/AuTiO2 composite generated a maximum of 1520 μmol/g/h H2 from photocatalytic water splitting [45]. The Ti3+ self-doped B–TiO2/g-C3N4 hollow core-shell heterojunction at nanoscale exhibited the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of 808 μmol/g/h [7]. The mesoporous ZnS-g-C3N4/TiO2 composite produced H2 at the rate of 422 μmol/g/h [46]. Finally, the C-dots modified g-C3N4/TiO2 gave a low H2 production rate of 210 mmol/g/h [47]. Therefore, it is clear that the g-C3N4/TiO2/NH4TiOF3 composite material reported in this work offers the best hydrogen production performance in comparison with those reported in the literature."
9,"Photocurrent response, EIS analysis and photocatalytic mechanism","3.4 Photocurrent response, EIS analysis and photocatalytic mechanism To understand the mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production, the EIS spectra of the catalyst samples were measured, as shown in Fig. 8 a. The composite material NTF/gCN/TO-3 has a small arc radius. The results show that the interfacial charge transfer on the surface of the composite material is faster, and the separation efficiency of the photoinduced e−-h+ pairs is higher, which proves that the heterostructure of titanium dioxide and g-C3N4 is conducive to the separation of e−-h+ and accelerates the charge transfer speed [48,49]. This structure is an effective way to improve the photocatalytic activity. Compared with TiO2 and g-C3N4, the composite material NTF/gCN/TO-3 enhanced the photocurrent signal and therefore exhibited better PC activity. Fig. 8f shows the ways of charge transfer Z-scheme heterojunctions involving g-C3N4 and TiO2. The CB and VB band edges of g-C3N4 are −1.22eV and 1.68eV, respectively, with respect to −0.29 eV and 2.91 eV for TiO2 [40]. Such band edge positions at the type-Ⅱ g-C3N4 and TiO2 heterojunction, electrons are transferred from the more negative CB of the g-C3N4 to the CB of the TiO2 and are enriched in the CB of the TiO2. The holes are transferred in the opposite direction, from the more positive VB of the TiO2 to the g-C3N4. The positions of the photoexcited electrons and holes were at the potentials of −0.29 and 1.68 eV respectively. The redox potentials from Z-scheme heterojunctions should be at −1.22 and 2.91 eV. Photocatalytically generated ·OH reacts rapidly with terephthalic acid to produce the highly fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid, which can be excited at 315 nm. Based on this mechanism, the alkaline solution of terephthalic acid was used to monitor the creation of ·OH radicals. From Fig. 8c, the signal of PL increases monotonously with the extension of photoexcitation time, indicating that ·OH radicals were continuously produced by the constant depletion of holes under illumination conditions. Meanwhile, DMPO, an ·OH radical capturer, was also used to verify the creation of ·OH, shown in Fig. 8d. Compared with the condition of in dark, there was obvious ·OH radical signal under the illumination condition. Meanwhile, when the illumination time was extended from 1 min to 10 min, and the ESR signal was also enhanced. It should be noted that the standard redox potentials of ·OH/OH− and ·OH/H2O are 1.99 and 2.68 eV [22,40] respectively. The semiquantitative observation of ·OH suggests that only the Z-scheme heterojunction mechanism produce the hydroxyl radicals, while the holes in the traditional type-Ⅱ heterojunctions only have the oxidation potential of 1.68 eV which is insufficient to produce the hydroxyl radicals. A similar situation can be applied to the production of superoxide radicals, shown in Fig. 8e. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Z-scheme heterojunction mechanism is necessary for the production of ·OH. From relevant literature and theoretical calculation [50], it is shown that there is a synergistic effect at the heterogeneous NH4TiOF3/TiO2 interface. There is an embedded electric field caused by the uneven charge distribution at the NH4TiOF3/TiO2 interface, which facilitates efficient charge separation and charge transfer. The average plane charge density in the interface region is positive, while the average plane charge density of the adjacent layers on the side of NH4TiOF3 is negative. This local electric field is strong enough to alter the kinetics of charge transfer. In this system, the NH4TiOF3 formed on the TiO2 surface forms a good contact at the interface, which improves the electron transfer capacity and helps to achieve rapid charge separation and charge transfer. This increases photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the 3D layered flower structures enable more efficient light utilization through the multiple refractions and reflections of light. Based on these reasons, the efficient photocatalytic activity of the composites is well established."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, NH4TiOF3 was synthesized by a simple and controllable method. The lamellar structure of TiO2 was obtained by the hydrolysis of NH4TiOF3. It was found that NH4TiOF3 was evenly dispersed on TiO2, and a 3D camellia-like Z-heterojunction was formed over the two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanochips. NH4TiOF3 improved the interface performance of TiO2 and g-C3N4 by hindering the rapid recombination of e−-h+ pairs. The formation of a high-quality interface between NH4TiOF3, TiO2 and g-C3N4 facilitates efficient charge separation and transmission. The results show that the photocatalyst composed of NH4TiOF3, TiO2, and g-C3N4 with a 3D camellia-like Z-scheme heterojunction can be used for high-performance hydrogen production. The progress in this work provides more opportunities and pathways for the design and synthesis of nanocomposites with much improved photocatalytic activities."
