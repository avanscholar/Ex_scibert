0,Introduction,"The photocatalytic water splitting process has been studied as an alternative way to yield hydrogen without negative impact on the environment, which is in contrast to that produced by burning fossil fuels, biomass or the electrochemical process [1]. Hydrogen production is highly effective by using nanoparticles of noble metals such as Pt, Rh or Au over TiO2 substrates [2]. Future trends in H2 production on a large scale should be considering low-cost metals like Ag, Cu, Ni, among others [3,4]. From them, copper seems to be a promising substitute of the expensive noble metals. In this sense, insights of the oxidation state of Cu for enhanced H2 photoproduction have been discussed in the literature [5]. Highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles can improve the behavior of the photocatalyst providing a lower charge carrier recombination rate in the semiconductor during the water splitting reaction. Tian et al., proposed the formation of Cu-Cu2O structures which can reduce the TiO2 structural defects, enhancing the charge transfer of the photocatalyst [6]. However, the interfacial charge transfer of the photogenerated electrons from the Cu nanoparticles to the electron acceptors is a very slow process in comparison with the charge transfer from TiO2 to the Cu nanoparticles. Therefore, these accumulated electrons may get confined to a reverse transportation process to the trap states of copper. Insights of the oxidation state of CuNPs to enhance H2 production have been discussed in the literature. Valero et al. have discussed that Cu2+species would be easily reduced during the reaction, forming CuO sites that would act as an effective cocatalyst for a water reduction reaction [7]. Cu-TiO2 impregnated with NPs can solve detrimental defects that favor the Cu charge, but cluster formation has been observed [8]. Photocatalytic hydrogen production by Cu/TiO2 has been assessed and compared with copper-impregnated TiO2 containing a similar copper load as high as 17% [6]. Photocatalysts prepared by the complex–precipitation method with a 10% copper load and calcined at 300°C have shown activity rates that have been higher than those obtained with wet impregnation catalysts, [9] although Cu nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface have been reported to be susceptible to partial photodissolution [10]. Cu photodeposition under UV irradiation can minimize this drawback, where copper leaching is marginal [11] comparing with impregnated materials; in brief, the advantages of preparing embedded CuOx into TiO2 photocatalysts for hydrogen production has been evidenced under different conditions: ethanol and glycerol water solutions or more elaborated Cu/CuO@TiO2 syntheses [12]. In the present work, the preparation of silver nanoparticles highly dispersed on the surface of Cu-TiO2 photocatalysts in order to reduce the surface backward reaction during the H2 photoproduction is reported."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts First, a copper diglycinate complex was prepared mixing Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Aldrich, 98%) and glycine (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) in distilled water at 90°C [13]. Then, an appropriate volume of the above solution and titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Aldrich, 97%) were simultaneously added dropwise to an ethanol-water solution at 70°C. The isopropoxide:ethanol:water molar ratio was 1:3:8, as previously reported [14]. The mixture was refluxed for 48h to obtain a colloidal solution and then dried in air at 70°C for 12h. The powder was calcined in air at 400°C for 4h. The copper amount was calculated in order to obtain loads of 1 and 5wt%. Pristine TiO2 was prepared under identical conditions and without the incorporation of the copper-glycine complex. The deposition of silver nanoparticles was performed through a photodeposition method [15]. An appropriate amount of the Cu-TiO2 photocatalyst was added to 50mL of an AgNO3 alcoholic solution. The slurry was irradiated with a 17-W-UV lamp (TecnoLite G15T8, 214nm) for 1h under stirring conditions. Finally, the powder was obtained by drying the suspension overnight in an oven at 100°C. The silver amount was calculated to obtain 0.5, 1, 2 and 3wt% of silver nanoparticles over the Cu doped TiO2. Cu-doped TiO2 samples were labeled as CuXTiO2, where X stands for the copper load. In the same way, the silver functionalized samples were labeled as AgY/CuXTiO2, where Y stands for the silver load."
3,Characterization of materials,"2.2 Characterization of materials X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained in the interval between 10 and 70° (2θ) using a D8 Bruker Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. BET surface area and porosity measurements were estimated from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms by using a Bel-Japan Minisorp II Surface Area & Pore Size analyzer. Prior to the N2 analysis, the samples were degassed at 200°C for 12h under vacuum conditions. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was performed by means of an Agilent Technologies Series Cary 5000 spectrometer with an integration sphere. Band gap data were estimated according to previous works reported in the literature [16]. Morphology of the photocatalysts was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a Tecnai FEI 300 microscope operated at 300kV."
4,Photocatalytic H2 production,"2.3 Photocatalytic H2 production The photocatalytic performance was tested using a home-made reactor containing 100mL of an isopropyl alcohol-water solution (1:10 v/v) and 100mg of the photocatalyst. The system was irradiated by means of a Hg pen lamp (254nm, 100W) encapsulated in a quartz tube and placed inside the reaction media. The H2 production was followed by gas chromatography (Varian CP-3800) using a thermal conductivity detector connected to a 5A column molecular sieve. The temperature of the reaction media was maintained at 25°C."
5,Results and discussions,"Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the CuXTiO2 samples annealed at 400°C. The main observed diffraction peaks can be indexed to the TiO2 anatase crystalline phase (PDF 21-1272) with a small diffraction peak corresponding to the TiO2 rutile phase (PDF 76-1940). According to the figure mentioned above, the rutile peak disappeared by adding Cu and the FWMH of the main peaks became broader than those displayed by TiO2. Diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic copper or their oxide compounds were not observed even at high concentrations (5wt%). The N2 adsorption-desorption measurements and pore size distributions are shown in Fig. 1b. These isotherms can be classified as type IV with an H2 hysteresis loop type, characteristic of pores with narrow and wide sections [17]. BET surface areas were estimated at 97.4, 92.5 and 51.3m2/g for the pristine TiO2, Cu1TiO2 and Cu5TiO2, respectively. As it can be seen, a considerable decrement was obtained for the sample with the highest copper amount. In addition, the pore size distribution exhibited a mean pore size of ~10nm, which was almost similar for all the samples (inset in Fig. 1b). The photocatalytic performance of the CuXTiO2 samples was tested through the H2 production under UV irradiation conditions. Fig. 2 shows the hydrogen photoproduction rates of the samples, where undoped TiO2 has a rate of 631μmolg−1 h−1 while the copper doped samples showed a higher production with rates of 3365 and 1690μmolg−1 h−1 for Cu1TiO2 and Cu5TiO2, respectively. These results confirm that the addition of Cu species substantially enhances the photoactivity up to 5 times the value obtained for bare TiO2. In this sense, Kubacka et al., reported that the addition of low amounts of copper species as doping agents to the anatase lattice would influence the charge handling properties within such a phase [18]. In order to reduce even more the surface backward reaction during the H2 photoproduction, several samples were prepared with different amounts of silver nanoparticles through a photodeposition procedure. In this case, only the Cu1TiO2 sample was used since it showed the highest photocatalytic behavior from the Cu-doped materials. The X-ray diffraction spectra of the AgY/CuXTiO2 samples do not show any peak corresponding to metallic silver or copper oxides as mentioned above for the Cu-doped samples (data not shown). Diffuse reflectance characterization was performed for the AgY/CuXTiO2 samples and the spectra are depicted in Fig. 3a. As it can be seen, a slight shift to the visible light region (corresponding to lower values of energy) occurred as the amount of silver nanoparticles was increased. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band located at ~2.65eV is clearly observed as it increases with the amount of silver nanoparticles (see inset of Fig. 3a). SPR is originated from the collective oscillation of electrons on the surface of the silver nanoparticles and it can be largely modified by the changes in the size and shape of the silver nanoparticles [19]. In our case, the position of this resonance band can be attributed to silver nanoparticles with sizes around 3nm anchored to the TiO2 surface [20]. In order to confirm the size and shape of the Ag nanoparticles, the samples were analyzed through transmission electron microscopy. Fig. 3b shows a representative image of the AgY/Cu1TiO2 samples where tiny spherical silver particles with sizes smaller than 5nm are observed attached to larger particles (≥20nm), which correspond to the TiO2 semiconductor, in Fig. 3c a representative HAADF-STEM image confirms the presence of AgNPs. Furthermore, there was no change in the BET surface area of Cu-TiO2 after the incorporation of silver nanoparticles, since they are present as nanoparticles attached to the photocatalyst surface. The hydrogen photoproduction rates of the AgY/Cu1TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 4. The results show that the incorporation of silver nanoparticles in the Cu-TiO2 samples provides an increase in the hydrogen production. A possible reason for this phenomenon is that the Ag nanoparticles can work as electron transfer agents forming a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor contact region [10]. In this way, negatively charged silver sites can react directly with the water molecules to provide the formation of hydrogen, reducing or retarding the recombination process of the charge carriers [21]. However, the increase in the H2 photoproduction was less pronounced when the amount of Ag nanoparticles was increased. This behavior can be explained because a high concentration of silver provokes a greater coverage of the surface and thereby a lower absorption of light and a decrease in the formation of the charge carriers in the photocatalyst. Doping with a copper complex has been pursued to diminish the recombination and also to create some defects such as oxygen vacancies. Loading with 1wt% of AgNPs allows to reduce the backward reaction on the Cu-TiO2 surface, where the H2 production rate was increased from 3477 to 3753molg−1 h−1. When the AgNP loading is increased to 2 or 3wt%, the H2 production rate is enhanced slowly due to the plasmonic effect that the bigger and closer AgNps provoke."
6,Conclusions,"An efficient Cu-TiO2 system was synthesized by means of a sol-gel method using a copper diglycinate complex as precursor. The obtained materials showed a good photocatalytic behavior through the H2 photoproduction reaction. Functionalization of the Cu-TiO2 photocatalyst with monodispersed silver nanoparticles provided a further increase in the hydrogen photoproduction rate. In this regard, the role played by the silver nanoparticles is to act as a sink of the photogenerated electrons through a Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor contact region providing a lower charge carrier recombination."
