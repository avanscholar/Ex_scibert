0,Introduction,"Selective aerobic oxidation reaction of alcohol to aldehyde is a significant process for the preparation of various chemical intermediates in pharmaceuticals, paints, plastics and fragrance industries [1,2]. The environmentally hazardous oxidants like chromates or permanganates have been used in the past by industries to carry out the oxidation reaction. Continuous efforts are being made in the direction of developing efficient and greener heterogeneous catalysts using hydrogen peroxide or molecular oxygen as the oxidant [3]. From the viewpoints of green chemistry, it is important to design and develop the catalysts which can function efficiently under milder conditions. The reported studies have revealed that the effect of support material, size of metal NPs and structural porosity play an important role in displaying the high catalytic activity [4–6]. TiO2 has been considered as the benchmark photocatalyst to carry out the oxidation reaction because of its stability and non-toxicity [7–10]. However, its light absorption in the UV-region limits its applicability in designing visible light responsive photocatalysts. The deposition of plasmonic metal NPs (Ag, Au, Cu) on TiO2 is one of the many alternative ways to extend its light absorption in the visible regime of the spectrum [11–13]. Amongst them, Au NPs has been researched and widely explored as a popular catalyst for the oxidation of alcohol, aldehyde, amines, sulfides and various hydrocarbons in milder reaction conditions [14–18]. The stability of NPs even under harsh conditions and strong visible light absorption band at 520 nm owing to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) phenomenon presents the opportunity to exploit the wider range of solar spectrum in the photocatalytic reaction [19,20]. The collective oscillation of surface electrons upon impinging light of suitable wavelength due to LSPR has recently been employed to carry out chemical transformation reactions, popularly known as plasmon-mediated catalytic reaction [21–27]. Such type of reaction can enhance the efficiency of overall photocatalytic process by generating hot electrons under visible light irradiation [28–31]. Gong and coworkers have reported the synthesis of high surface area plasmonic Au nanorod@TiO2 yolk-shell nanostructures for the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation reaction [32]. The catalysts consist of TiO2 as the hollow shell with Au nanorod in the internal part. The detachment between Au and TiO2 provides the active sites for catalytic reaction. Shiraishi et al. concluded that the diameters of plasmonic Au NPs < 5 nm immobilized on the interface of anatase/rutile TiO2 act as the active centre for oxidation reaction under visible light irradiation [33]. In another study, they reported the synthesis of 3.4 nm sized spherical Au-Cu bimetallic alloy NPs supported on P25 TiO2. The presence of SPR band at around 550 nm for Au/P25 and a less intense red shifted peak was obtained for bimetallic Au-Cu alloy NPs. Under visible light irradiation, the hot electrons generated by Au-plasmon reduces the surface oxidized Cu atoms to promote the aerobic oxidation of 2-propanol to acetone [34]. In the present research report, we have designed and synthesized three different types of Au/TiO2 plasmonic photocatalysts by tuning the morphology of TiO2 and tested in the controlled oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The effect of plasmonic Au NPs in enhancing the rate of catalytic reaction was studied under visible light irradiation. Different morphology of TiO2 support material was prepared by a simple hydrothermal treatment of Anatase TiO2 with different alkali hydroxide solution. The morphologies can be tuned and tailored to be tubule, rod and microporous particles upon employing NaOH, KOH and LiOH as the alkaline peptizing agents, respectively [35,36]. The observed porous structure and high surface area of prepared material can play a vital role in the photocatalytic application reaction. The decoration of TiO2 with plasmonic spherical Au NPs was carried out by impregnation-H2 reduction method. The catalysts Au/TiO2 nanotube, nanorod and microporous displayed different reaction rates under the continuous flow of O2 at 398 K for benzaldehyde production. The factors affecting the reaction rate can be explained due to morphological difference in the support material, size of Au NPs, surface area and their optical response in the solar spectrum. We have compared the catalytic reaction activities in dark (thermal) and under visible light irradiation (thermal and light) conditions. It is noteworthy to mention that this research study purely based on comparing the enhancement effects arising from plasmonic Au NPs and the effects arising from TiO2 absorption has been obstructed by using a cut off filter allowing the light of wavelengths greater than 420 nm. However, the effects arising from different morphology and textural properties of TiO2 has been taken into consideration. The observed enhancement under visible light irradiation has been discussed and a plausible reaction pathway has been proposed for the superior catalytic performances by Au NPs."

Aluminum oxide (α-Al2O3) and Iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification."
3,Synthesis of TiO2 support material,"2.2 Synthesis of TiO2 support material The support TiO2 material was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment as reported by Cho et al [35]. Anatase TiO2 with trace amount of rutile was used to synthesize the morphology-controlled structures. TiO2 was mixed with 10 M of basic MOH aqueous solution (M = Li, Na and K). The mixture was stirred for 30 min and then placed in the Teflon autoclave reactor at 400 K for 30 h. Subsequently, the mixture was filtered and then washed repeatedly with 0.1 N HCl solution until pH became equivalent to 1.5. The obtained solid powder was stirred again in HCl solution to leach out the excess of alkaline metal ions. The sample was then dried in oven at 330 K after filtration. The obtained TiO2 samples were named as TiO2 nanotube, nanorod and microporous obtained by the treatment of NaOH, KOH and LiOH aqueous solution, respectively."
4,Synthesis of Au/TiO2 catalysts,"2.3 Synthesis of Au/TiO2 catalysts 1.0 wt % of Au nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited on TiO2 support nanostructures (Nanotube, Nanorod and microporous) by simple impregnation and reduction process. The TiO2 nanotube support material (0.1 g) was dispersed in 100 mL ethanol and ultrasonicated until a uniform suspension was obtained. 0.5 mL of 10 mM HAuCl4 aqueous solution was added into the suspension and stirred continuously for 2 h. Afterwards, the solvent was evaporated by Rota vapor and the sample was dried overnight in air at 80 °C. The NPs were reduced by gaseous hydrogen at 573 K for 2 h. The obtained reduced sample was denoted as Au/TiO2 nanotube. The same process was followed for the synthesis of Au/TiO2 nanorod, Au/TiO2 microporous and for other metal oxide support materials (Fe2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 and CeO2) catalyst."
5,Catalytic reaction,"2.4 Catalytic reaction The controlled oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under the flow of O2 (5 mL min−1) is carried out as a model reaction to study the activity of the prepared Au catalysts. 10 mg of Au/TiO2 catalyst was weighed and added into the quartz glass reactor along with 1 mmol of benzyl alcohol and 0.5 mmol of K2CO3 to ensure basic medium of the reaction. To the same reactor, 0.25 mmol of an external standard reagent biphenyl was added for calibrating the concentration of reactants and products during the course of the reaction. Subsequently, 5 mL of toluene was added, and reactor was magnetically stirred at 373 K in an oil bath. The reaction was initiated by flowing atmospheric O2 at 5 mL min−1 through the reaction mixture. The time course of reaction products was analyzed by using GC-2014 SHIMADZU gas chromatograph with a column of TC-1 (100% dimethylpolysiloxane) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The reaction was carried out under thermal conditions (373 K) and under light irradiation conditions (373 K + visible light, λ > 420 nm) for 4 h. The reaction products were monitored at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h intervals of time."

BaSO4 was used as a reference solid and the spectra were collected by employing Kubelka-Munk function. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement was performed by using a BEL-SORP max system (Microtrac BEL) at 77 K. Degassing of the samples was done in a vacuum at 393 K for 4 h in order to remove the adsorbed impurities. TEM micrographs were obtained with a H-800 TEM operated at 200 kV. Shimadzu ESCA-3400 electron spectrometer was used to characterize samples for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Mg Kα X-ray radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV) was used as the excitation source. The binding energy of the spectra was calibrated using the C 1s core level peak at 284.8 eV. SAN-EI ELECTRIC Super Bright 500, Model XEF-501S Xenon lamp was used as light source to carry out reactions under light irradiation conditions.

7,Results and discussions,
8,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results 3.1.1 N2 physisorption analysis To study the porosity, surface area and textural properties of the catalysts, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was employed and the values obtained are summarized in Table 1 . The N2 physisorption analysis was measured for the morphology controlled TiO2 and Au/TiO2 catalysts and the obtained isotherms are shown in Fig. 1 . The BET surface area and pore volume did not show significant alteration and a correlation in the values before and after Au NPs deposition. The pore size of the material decreased after NPs synthesis except for Au/TiO2 microporous, where no change in the pore size of the material was observed. For example, TiO2 nanorod displayed pore size of 2.2 nm, whereas Au/TiO2 nanorod pore size reduced to 1.6 nm. TiO2 nanotube displayed pore size decrement from 2.3 to 1.6 nm after Au NPs deposition. It was also confirmed that the larger BET surface area Au/TiO2 microporous catalyst (125.3 m2 g−1) has the smallest sized Au NPs of about 4.1 nm and Au/TiO2 nanorod catalyst with least surface area of 73.2 m2 g−1 has the largest sized NPs of 6.2 nm. From the hysteresis curve, only TiO2 microporous and Au/TiO2 microporous showing microporous volume, conforming their structure whereas it was absent in nanorod and nanotube structures. Surface area of the material is an important factor in testing the activity of the oxidation reaction. It is expected that high surface area accelerates the consumption of electrons by promoting the adsorption of O2 (electron acceptor) and thereby increasing the overall rate of the reaction. However, in the present case it is difficult to derive conclusion on the basis of surface area values because of irregular variations. We predicted that other factors like size of NPs, light absorption ability and basicity of support material also play a key role in determining the efficiency of the catalyst as discussed in later section. 3.1.2 UV–vis absorption measurement The UV–vis absorption spectra were measured in order to quantify the extent of light absorption by the prepared catalysts and support materials. Fig. 2 summarizes the absorption spectra of TiO2 before and after the NPs deposition. Fig. 2 (B) inset also shows the magnified peak at approximately 540–560 nm owing to the Au LSPR effect. The LSPR peak of Au/TiO2 nanorod was observed at 540 nm and red shifted peak was obtained for Au/TiO2 nanotube and Au/TiO2 microporous at 552 and 556 nm respectively. The peak position and absorption intensity play an important role while studying and analyzing the results of plasmon mediated catalytic reactions. The obtained single broad peak was attributed to the spherical morphology of the designed NPs which was further confirmed by TEM. This plasmonic absorption peak enhances the overall visible light harvesting ability of the catalyst. The Au/TiO2 catalysts appeared purple-pink in color whereas the TiO2 samples were greyish-white in appearance. The effect of UV-light absorption by TiO2 was ignored by a cut-off filter in order to study the effects arising from the visible light absorption of Au NPs. The trend in the absorption intensity in UV regime remains the same for with and without Au NPs catalyst; microporous > nanorod > nanotube. However, the order of absorption intensities in the visible regime was found to be; nanorod > nanotube > microporous, arising due to LSPR charge oscillations within Au NPs. Interestingly, the order of catalytic reaction activity was found to be in correlation with the Au absorption intensity as discussed in later section. 3.1.3 TEM measurement The Au NPs were grown on the TiO2 by simple impregnation followed by H2 treatment at 573 K. This method proved to be effective in synthesizing nano-sized Au NPs with narrow size distribution. Au NPs in general have the tendency to form large clusters which was not observed in the present research study. Fig. 3 displays the TEM micrographs of the three Au/TiO2 catalysts along with their size distribution histograms shown in the inset. The average size of NPs obtained from the TEM micrographs was measured to be 5.7 ± 1.6 nm for Au/TiO2 nanotube, 6.2 ± 1.9 nm for Au/TiO2 nanorod and 4.1 ± 1.1 nm for Au/TiO2 microporous, also listed in Table 1. It was difficult to clearly see the NPs in the case of microporous support while clear and separated NPs were observed in the case of nanotube and nanorod support materials. We observed that the larger sized NPs in Au/TiO2 nanorod exhibited superior catalytic performance whereas the smallest sized NPs in Au/TiO2 microporous displayed poor catalytic performance in thermal and under light irradiation conditions. In all the cases, the catalyst was found to be stable even at higher temperatures and no leaching or aggregation of NPs was observed after the reaction. The catalyst could easily be collected and recycled by simple filtration. We did not see any significant change in the morphology and color of the catalyst before and after the reaction. 3.1.4 XPS analysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was studied to see the electronic structure, oxidation state and local environment around Au NPs supported on TiO2. Fig. 4 displays the Au 4f XPS spectra for Au NPs deposited on TiO2 nanotube, nanorod and microporous is shown in Fig. 4. The core level 4f spectra splits into doublet peaks; 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 which were separated by 3.7 eV. This confirms the metallic nature of Au NPs in the three catalysts. Au/TiO2 nanorod displayed the most intense peak with binding energy (B.E.) values centered at 86.7 and 83.0 eV ascribing to 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 core levels of Au. The doublet peaks for Au/TiO2 nanotube and Au/TiO2 microporous were observed at binding energies of (86.6, 82.9) and (86.8, 83.1), respectively. These values were plotted after calibrating the obtained values with respect to C1 s peak observed at 284.8 eV. The successive shift in the B.E. values by 0.1 eV towards higher numbers was observed for Au/TiO2 nanotube, nanorod and then microporous particles. This implies the most oxidized state of Au NPs in microporous support material. Further, a low intense peak was obtained for Au/TiO2 microporous, which might attribute to the poor distribution of NPs. The Ti 2p XPS spectra for TiO2 and Au/TiO2 catalysts is shown in Fig. S1. The spin-orbit coupling leads to doublet peaks (2p3/2 and 2p1/2) separated by 5.7 eV. After C1 s calibration, the B.E. values were observed at 458.6 eV (2p3/2) and 464.3 eV (2p1/2) for Au/TiO2 nanorod catalyst. Similarly, the values were obtained for all catalysts and plotted as shown in Fig. S1."
9,Catalytic reaction,"3.2 Catalytic reaction The prepared catalysts were tested in the model test reaction of controlled oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Many research studies report the importance of TiO2 as a support material in the oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde. In this study, we investigated the effect of different morphologies/texture of TiO2 material in the overall oxidation ability of Au NPs. The different catalytic activities can be attributed to various factors involved in the different catalytic activities of support materials such as surface area, pore volume, size of NPs in promoting the O2 adsorption to increase the rate of electron consumption and hence the oxidation activity. The catalytic reaction was carried out at 373 K and monitored continuously for 4 h under the continuous flow of O2 at 5 mL min−1 as shown in Scheme 1 . No product formation was observed in the absence of catalyst. Fig. 5 displays the reaction time profile for the benzaldehyde production in thermal and visible light irradiation conditions. We observed that the three catalysts exhibited TiO2 morphology-dependent catalytic activities in thermal and light irradiation conditions. Fig. S2 also compares the catalytic activity of three catalysts in thermal conditions. The most active catalyst for the benzaldehyde formation was found to be Au/TiO2 nanorod (33%) followed by Au/TiO2 nanotube (23%) and Au/TiO2 microporous (10%). The highest catalytic activity of Au/TiO2 nanorod was shown by the largest size Au NPs while the least active performance was shown by the smallest size NPs in Au/TiO2 microporous, also summarized in Fig. 6 . A similar trend with enhanced activities was observed when visible light (λ > 420 nm) was impinged in the reaction system at thermal conditions. A highest product yield of 55% benzaldehyde at 4 h was observed for Au/TiO2 nanorod. Au/TiO2 nanotube forms 46% of product whereas Au/TiO2 microporous produces least amount of 12% benzaldehyde at 4 h. Table S1 summarizes the conversion and selectivity of all the catalysts in thermal and light irradiation conditions. The screening of Au NPs deposited on different support materials (Fe2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, CeO2) was carried out and the obtained TEM images and UV–vis spectra of Au/MxOy is summarized in Fig. S3. The order of catalytic performances in dark and under light irradiation followed the order Au/TiO2 nanorod > Au/CeO2 > Au/ZrO2 > Au/SiO2 and Au/Fe2O3 is shown in Fig. S4. The catalytic enhancement results using Fe2O3 and SiO2 as the support material was found to be almost negligible, whereas ZrO2, CeO2 and TiO2 displayed significant enhancements under visible light irradiation. This increment is attributed to the LSPR effect and possible interactions of Au NPs with the support material, which was found to be highest for TiO2 NRs. The reaction yield on commercially available P25 TiO2 displayed a moderate catalytic performance of 30% product yield as shown in Fig. S5. The enhanced catalytic activities Au/TiO2 nanorod > Au/TiO2 nanotube > Au/TiO2 microporous follows the same trend of their absorption intensities in the UV–vis spectrum. The corresponding calculated External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) values were found to be 3.40, 2.84 and 0.74% respectively at λ ≥ 420 nm for a reaction time of 4 h as summarized in Table S2. Fig. 6 summarizes the product yield in dark (thermal) and under light irradiation conditions, further correlating the enhancements with the size of NPs. The rate of aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was significantly enhanced by the plasmonic excitation of Au NPs especially in the case of TiO2 nanotube and nanorod as the support material. The proposed reaction pathway for plasmon-mediated oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is shown in Fig. 7 . The LSPR excitation of Au NPs induces the hot electron and hole on the surface upon visible light irradiation using a cut off filter (λ > 420 nm). The generated electrons get transferred to the O2 molecule to form anionic oxygen moieties as shown in step II. The negatively charged O2 − species attracts the H atom from the benzyl alcohol to form the −OOH bond on the surface of Au NPs and the alcohol species get oriented to the positively charged hot hole sites (step III). Another H atom removal from the benzyl alcohol produces benzaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide as shown in step IV [32–34,37,38]. Hence, the charge separation effect arising from the LSPR excitation of Au NPs leads to the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of substrate (electron donor) and O2 (electron acceptor) at different sites. TiO2 surface can selectively adsorb benzyl alcohol and desorb benzaldehyde at hot electron and hot hole sites, which maybe resulted in the predominant formation of benzaldehyde without the over oxidation."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, we have shown the comparison of structural characterization and plasmon mediated catalysis of Au NPs deposited on morphology-controlled TiO2 catalyst. Amongst the three different catalysts prepared in this study; Au/TiO2 nanotube, Au/TiO2 nanorod and Au/TiO2 microporous; Au/TiO2 nanorod was found to display most active performance under the same reaction conditions. The significant enchantment effects were observed in the product yield under light irradiation conditions at 373 K under the continuous flow of O2 at 5 mL min−1. We observed a linear correlation between the catalytic performance under visible light irradiation and the LSPR absorption intensities of the prepared catalysts. We anticipate that such design and developments in the synthesis of plasmonic NPs and tuning of support materials will help in paving the path for designing visible light sensitive heterogeneous catalysts.
