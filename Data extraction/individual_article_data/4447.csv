0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2), an alternative clean energy source and an environmentally friendly fuel, could play an important role as a primary energy carrier in future by virtue of the fact that it can be produced from renewable sources. It is efficiently converted to electricity for zero-emission automobile applications by PEM fuel cells [1–3]. Although hydrogen is the most abundant element, high-purity hydrogen can be produced from a liquid hydrocarbon or/and alcohol fuel (such as methanol [4], ethanol [5], gasoline [6], and dimethyl ether [7]) reforming process as a practical option. Among all of these sources, methanol is preferred as a “hydrogen vector” [8] with abundant advantages, such as its low boiling point, high energy density as a liquid, high H/C ratio, which reduces soot formation [9], and no C–C bonds, hence minimizing the risk of coke formation [10]. The use of methanol also avoids the possibility of the appearance of many side products, compared with oxygenated compounds [11]. In addition, the methanol reforming process can be operated at moderate temperature (200–400°C) without causing a net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere [12]. Conventionally, steam reforming of methanol (SRM) and partial oxidation of methanol (POM) have been the most widely used processes. Along with higher hydrogen production with a lower amount of CO as a poisoning gas for PEM fuel cells [13,14], oxidative methanol reforming (OSRM)—the combination of SRM and POM, in the presence of steam and oxygen—is thought to be a promising way to achieve these goals with energy saving (by supplying the energy released from the POM to the SRM reaction), thus making it able to be run adiabatically at lower temperature [15,16], as shown in the following equation: (1) CH 3 OH + ( 1 - δ ) H 2 O + 0.5 δ O 2 → CO 2 + ( 3 - δ ) H 2 , Δ H 0 = 49.5 – 241.8 δ kJ mol - 1 where δ is the stoichiometric coefficient (0< δ <1). Agrell et al. studied the SRM, POM, and OSRM reactions and found that the CO levels decrease as a function of the H2 selectivity as per the following: SRM>OSRM>POM [17]. The catalysts for the OSRM have received much attention in recent years for their high activity at low temperature. The most suitable catalysts used are those based on Ni, Pd, and Pt supported on neutral or basic supports such as MgO, ZnO and CeO2. However, gold catalysts have been proven to be exceptionally active for many reactions, including low-temperature CO oxidation [18] and WGSR reactions [19]. Gold nanoparticles have been deposited on various supports such as Fe2O3 [20], CeO2 [21], MnO2 [22], MgO [23], TiO2 [24–26], Al2O3 [27], ZnO [28], and ZrO2 [29]. Among the effective supports, the ceria (CeO2) possesses many attractive properties according to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [30], which allows it to store and release active oxygen for specific reactions, such as CO oxidation and steam reforming [31]. It would, therefore, be beneficial for stakeholders who produce hydrogen by using Au-based catalysts in the process. The main purpose of this research was to investigate the catalytic activity of Au supported on CeO2 prepared by deposition–precipitation for the OSRM in the low temperature range. To our knowledge, it is the first time that Au/CeO2 was utilized as a catalyst for an OSRM reaction."
1,Experimental testing,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Au/CeO2 catalyst was prepared by the deposition–precipitation technique. For support preparation, CeO2 support was prepared by precipitation method with an appropriate amount of a 0.1M aqueous solution of cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate—Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Aldrich). The pH of the solution was adjusted to ∼8 by the addition of 0.1M Na2CO3 (Riedel–de Haen). Afterward, the sample was washed, dried, and calcined in air at 400°C for 4h in order to obtain a CeO2 catalyst support. For gold deposition, similar techniques have been reported elsewhere [25,26]. In this experiment, CeO2 support was suspended in an aqueous solution of HAuCl4·3H2O (Alfa AESAR) (0.005M). The pH of the suspension was adjusted to 8 at 80°C by 0.1M Na2CO3 (Riedel–de Haen). After the resulting solution was stirred for 1h and cooled to room temperature, the suspension was washed by warm deionized water to eliminate the residue ions. The deionized precipitate was dried at 110°C overnight and calcined in air at various temperatures for 4h. The Au/CeO2 calcined at each calcination temperature, was designated as iAu-(Y), where i and Y were Au loading (%) and calcination temperature, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) of the prepared catalysts was performed on a JEOL X-ray diffractometer system (JDX-3530) with a Cu Kα (1.5406Å) X-ray source operating at 40kV and 30mA. The size and distribution of the Au particles deposited on the supports were directly observed by a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM 2010) at an accelerating voltage of 200kV in bright field mode. Before being transferred into the TEM chamber, the samples were dispersed in ethanol and were then dropped onto a copper grid. The average Au particle size diameter (d TEM) was calculated from the following formula: d TEM =∑(nidi )/ni , where ni is the number of Au particles of diameter di . DR/UV–Vis spectroscopy experiments allow for checking the presence of different states of oxidation of the contained metals (which were here recorded on a Shimadzu UV spectrophotometer 2550). The measurements were performed on air-exposed samples at ambient temperature between 200 and 800nm. The absorption intensity was expressed using the Kubelka–Munk function, F(R∞)=(1− R∞)2/(2R∞), where R∞ is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer. An atomic absorption spectrometer (Varian/SpectraAA 300) was used to determine the actual Au metal content. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was utilized for the evaluation of the reducibility of the catalysts and was employed by using 10% H2 in Ar at 30mL/min as a reducing gas in a conventional TPR reactor equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The reduction temperature was raised from 30 to 850°C at a ramp rate of 10°C/min. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to determine the surface area and pore size of the catalysts by N2 adsorption/desorption at −196°C. Specific surface area was determined using an Autosorb-1 surface area analyzer. The amount of carbon formation of the spent catalysts was measured by means of temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). About 50mg of the powdered samples was packed in a quartz tube reactor before being heated from 100°C with a heating rate of 12°C/min to 900°C under a flow of 2% O2/He using a gas flow rate 30mL/min. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the samples were recorded using a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer in absorbance mode at 32 scans with a resolution of 4cm−1. The spectra in the frequency range of 4000 to 400cm−1 were obtained by using a deuterated triglycerinesulfate detector (DTGS) with a specific detectivity of 1×109 cmHz1/2 w−1."
4,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.3 Catalytic activity measurements The OSRM reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor containing 100mg of the Au/CeO2 catalysts of 80–120 mesh holes under atmospheric pressure with a reaction temperature of 200–400°C. A mixture of distilled water and methanol in a syringe was injected continuously by a syringe pump at a rate of 1.5mL/h to a vaporizer to produce a vapor of methanol and steam, which was mixed with the He carrier gas and oxygen before entering the catalytic reactor. The H2O/CH3OH and O2/CH3OH molar ratios were varied from 1/1 to 4/1 and 0 to 2.50, respectively. The Au content and calcination temperature were varied from 1 to 5wt% and 300 to 600°C, respectively. Finally, the deactivation testing of the prepared catalysts was done for 168h. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was kept at 30000mL/gcat h. The product gases (e.g. H2, CO, CO2, and CH4) from the reactor were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively by a Hewlett Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Methanol conversion (Xi ) was defined as (CO+CO2 +CH4)/CH3OH feed in, and the hydrogen yield was calculated from the product of multiplying the methanol conversion and the hydrogen selectivity. The selectivity of each product gas was defined by the mole percentage in the product stream. No methane formation was observed from this study."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The chemical compositions obtained by AAS and the BET surface areas of the CeO2 support and supported Au catalysts—with various Au loadings and calcination temperatures—are summarized in Table 1 . It can be noticed that BET surface areas notably decrease with Au content and decreased from 202 to 90m2/g after the Au loading. For the pore radius, the pore size of CeO2 support decreased from 44.2Å to 39.0Å after increasing the Au loading. It could be implied that the high Au content blocked the pores of the support. Nevertheless, the highest Au loading (5wt%) did not display the same trend as the other samples and was not in correlation with the surface area. The surface area of the 5wt% Au/CeO2 decreased progressively with increasing calcination temperature—from 126m2/g (300°C) to 69m2/g (600°C)—since the high calcination temperature strongly affected the sintering of the gold particles, resulting in larger particle size. As expected, the pore size of 5wt% Au/CeO2 increased from 41.6 to 62.2Å with increasing calcination temperatures from 300 to 600°C, suggesting that there was a significant effect of calcination temperature on the growth of Au particles and thus resulted in the decrease of the catalytic activity [32]. From Fig. 1 , it can be seen that the peak intensity of Au (111) at 38.5° became detectable when the Au loading was at 5%. Apparently, the diffraction of CeO2 presented a very strong peak at XRD 2θ =28.5°, which is characteristic of the fluorite structure. Similar to previous works, weak peaks were also detected, at 33.08°, 47.47°, 56.33°, 59.08°, 69.40°, 76.69°, and 79.07°, corresponding to (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), and (420) for the Cu Kα (1.5406Å) radiation, respectively [33]."
7,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity 3.2.1 Effect of H2O/CH3OH molar ratio For the catalytic performance of 1wt% Au/CeO2 (Fig. 2 ), the methanol conversion and hydrogen yield increased with reaction temperature at all H2O/CH3OH molar ratios since the addition of steam led to the SRM, which corresponded to an endothermic reaction. For the optimum conditions, the H2O/CH3OH molar ratio of 2/1 (compared to other molar ratios) gave the highest catalytic activity with the highest methanol conversion and hydrogen yield in the whole range of reaction temperatures. The water pressure was proven to contribute to the desorption of surface carbonates, which are very well-known poisoning by-products for CeO2 [34]. After increasing the H2O/CH3OH molar ratios to 3/1, the catalytic activity decreased significantly. This can be explained by the formation of hydroxyl groups, formate, and carbonate species—adsorbed reaction intermediates [35]—which block the active sites of the catalysts during the reaction with a high amount of steam in the feedstream, as confirmed by FTIR. When the H2O/CH3OH molar ratio was increased to 4/1, the catalytic activity increased dramatically because an appropriate amount of steam decomposed the carbonate species, which blocked the active sites. Then, the catalysts were reactivated again [36]. The FTIR spectra of the spent 1wt% Au/CeO2 catalysts with various H2O/CH3OH molar ratios (Fig. 3 ) illustrate both hydroxyl groups (a) and carbonate species (a and b). For the hydroxyl groups, a board transmission in the OH region can be observed in the range of 3200–3600cm−1, which follows the OH stretching mode of water molecules [36] while the carbonate species on the surface were clearly detected in many positions, including unspecified carbonate species in the range of 800–1800cm−1 and 2500–3000cm−1. Costello et al. (2003) proposed that a possible pathway of the carbonate formation at the active sites of Au/Al2O3 catalysts was the dehydration of the surface bicarbonate intermediate (–CO3H) and an adjacent hydroxyl (OH−) [37]. The associate mechanisms of formate formation, as the intermediate species on the ceria surface containing deposited precious metal (Rh/CeO2), was reported [38,39]. In addition, the formate species were found as reaction intermediates during the water gas shift reaction over Au/CeO2 using FTIR measurements [35]. All of these species were identified as the main cause of catalyst deactivation resulting from the blocking of the active sites [36]. Interestingly, the FTIR profile of the 3/1 H2O/CH3OH showed strong bands at 2853, and at 2924 and 2955cm−1, relating to the formate species on Ce3+ and Ce4+, respectively, which could also definitely block the active sites [35]. This was in agreement with the lowest methanol conversion and hydrogen yield. However, the formate species decreased significantly after increasing the H2O/CH3OH to 4/1 since the appropriate amount of steam might lead to the modified mechanism of formate decomposition on the active sites, as shown in Fig. 3a [35]. Consequently, the catalyst became activated again. From Fig. 3b, the carbonate species became lowest with the lowest catalytic activity at a H2O/CH3OH molar ratio of 3/1. It revealed the exchange of formate and carbonate species over the Au/CeO2 catalyst. It could be implied that the high amount of steam also reacted with the carbonate species and formed the less stable bicarbonate, and it was then converted to CO2 and H2O as the final products [37,40,41]. This explanation followed a potential mechanism for the decomposition of the carbonates—known as reverse carbonate formation—via the less stable bicarbonate, which had been proposed in Refs. [37,40,41]. However, the authors suggested that the catalytic performance might depend on the formate species more than on the carbonate species. After increasing the H2O/CH3OH molar ratio to 4/1, the carbonate species started to increase with a decrease in formate species. This was in line with Jacobs et al. (2004), where a high amount of steam could further convert the formate species to unidentate carbonate during the formate decomposition, leading to CO2 as the final product [42,43]. However, it was speculated that the formate species may be the main cause of lower catalytic activity and the schematic of the carbonate and formate species with different H2O/CH3OH molar ratios is shown in Fig. 3c. 3.2.2 Effect of O2/CH3OH molar ratio The effects of O2/CH3OH molar ratio of the feed on the methanol conversion and the hydrogen yield at a H2O/CH3OH molar ratio of 2/1 over the 1wt% Au/CeO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . The ratio of O2 to methanol varied from 0 to 2.5. The methanol conversion was enhanced greatly in the whole range of reaction temperatures with the addition of oxygen to the reaction, according to the combination between SRM and POM reactions. In addition, at an O2/CH3OH molar ratio of 1.25/1, methanol conversion was higher than 90% at a reaction temperature of 250°C, and continually increased to 98.63% at 400°C. A significant improvement of hydrogen yield was also observed at this ratio in the low temperature range (200–300°C). We suggest that the hydrogen yield became lowest with high oxygen—O2/CH3OH—content due to the shifting of the OSRM to POM. Patel et al. also achieved the same results, where the hydrogen production rate significantly decreased with increasing O2/CH3OH molar ratio because of the POM reaction, while the methanol conversion remained at 100% [10]. The selectivities of gas products for SRM and OSRM reactions were compared, as shown in Fig. 5 , it was found that the SRM gave much higher H2 selectivity than OSRM at all reaction temperatures. It agrees well with Agrell et al. that H2 selectivity follows the order SRM>OSRM>POM [17] in the low temperature range (200–300°C). Interestingly, the selectivity to H2 substantially decreases, whereas the CO2 selectivity increases considerably with increasing O2 content. These results infer that the existence of POM reaction is taking place at a significant extent. Both CO and CO2 were produced in noticeable amounts under POM reaction since the CO2 selectivity was increased to the maximum value when the highest O2/CH3OH was used, while the CO could not be produced via methanol decomposition, or possibly diminished by the CO oxidation."
8,Effect of Au content and calcination temperature,"3.3 Effect of Au content and calcination temperature As illustrated in Fig. 6 , methanol conversion increased with increasing Au content, and this tendency was observed at the high temperature range. The trends of methanol conversion and the reaction temperature cannot be explained by the Au loading because this reaction is a combination of steam reforming and partial oxidation. At low Au loading (1%), Au could be well dispersed and the Au crystallite sizes are small; thus the catalytic activity of the 1% Au/CeO2 was high. At 3% Au loading, opposite effects were observed in the low temperature range, and the 5% Au loading content exhibited the highest performance (100% methanol conversion), compared to the 1% and 3% loadings, while improvement in hydrogen yields was not observed. As reported in Fig. 7 , both the methanol conversion and the hydrogen yield of the 5% Au/CeO2 calcined at 300°C, were low while the highest catalytic activity—a methanol conversion of 100% and the highest hydrogen yield of 23.52%—was observed when the catalysts were calcined at 400°C. On the other hand, the catalysts calcined at high calcination temperatures (500°C and 600°C) exhibited lower catalytic activity since the catalyst underwent slight sintering. Based on the Scherrer equation, there was only a slight difference in crystallinity of the CeO2 with increasing Au loading. The crystallite size of Au(111) increased to 9.38nm, which is in agreement with many previous works where an increasing of the Au metal could enhance the crystallinity of the Au particles [44]. In comparison to Fig. 1, the appearance of the Au(111) reflection became more visible when the calcination temperature was raised, while there was no significant difference in the crystallite planes of CeO2. This is in line with Chang et al. (2007), where it was demonstrated that the crystallite size of Au increased with increasing calcination temperature [45]. Interestingly, the appearance of Au(200) and Au(220) reflections, which could be detectable at 2θ =44.4° and 64.6° [46], respectively, was also observed after calcination at 500°C, indicating that agglomeration of the Au particles occurred at that temperature. Eun and Jae (1998) studied the effect of calcination temperature on the Au particle size of Au/Fe2O3 and found that the catalytic activity decreased as the calcination temperature increased since the particle size of Au grew larger with increasing calcination temperatures [32]. Furthermore, the Au particle size was further confirmed by the TEM technique. From the TPR profiles (Fig. 8 ), the high surface area ceria presented a broader peak situated close to 486°C, which has been typically assigned to a surface reduction process [42,43] while the peaks at low temperature (113–158°C) correspond to the reduction of the Au x O y species (or Au hydroxide) to Au metal (Au0). As has been noted in previous experiments, the addition of metals can catalyze the surface reduction process, shifting the broad peak to lower temperatures, while not impacting the bulk ceria reduction [42,43]. Among the supported Au catalysts, the peak was found to shift toward lower temperatures over the catalysts with higher loading. It was noted that the maximum peak temperatures shifted to lower temperatures with the presence of Au, which weakened the surface oxygen of CeO2. This was consistent with a detectable metal–support interaction between Au and ceria, which has been shown to hinder the Au reduction at low loadings, where the interaction between metal and ceria would be stronger. To better understand, an increased Au loading could assist in decreasing metal–support interaction, suggesting that the large Au particle size with high Au loading was more easily reduced to lower temperature [42,43]. As a result, the OSRM activity of this catalyst could be obtained. In contrast, an increase in calcination temperature did not seem to improve the metal–metal interaction and the metal–support interaction of the 5wt% Au/CeO2 according to the slight difference in reduction temperature of Au x O y , which is approximately in the range of 133–112°C. From the UV–Vis spectra, the absorption band in the 500–600nm region could be assigned to the gold nanoparticles (plasmon) [47] or Au metallic (Au0) species while CeO2 also showed bands in the range of 200–350nm (Fig. 9 ). As can be seen, the plasmon band was more pronounced when the Au loading was increased to 5wt%. In fact, this evidence was in line with the trends of the XRD results, which showed the Au peaks at high Au loading. In addition, these results also supported the TPR results—with the strongest band at 550nm—where the highest Au loading represented the greatest metal–metal interaction, which led to the formation of larger Au metallic particles. The greater contact area between Au and CeO2 can account for its higher activity. Nonetheless, it could be seen that the high activity of the supported Au catalysts strongly depended on the nature of the active sites. Chang et al. (2007) found that the active Au catalysts always contain metallic Au particles, while the oxidic Au species are not responsible for steady-state high catalytic activity [45]. This could be an acceptable reason why the highest gold loading has the highest catalytic activity at a high temperature (⩾200°C), in this case. However, the state of the gold in active catalysts is still unclear and this behavior has not yet been elucidated. With different calcination temperatures (Fig. 9b), the catalytic activities of the catalysts calcined at 300 and 400°C and the presence of the Au metallic particle at 550nm could be related. The catalyst calcined at 400°C and the highest amount of Au0 species exhibited the highest catalytic performance. This may imply that more Au0 species played an important role in higher catalytic performance for the catalyst calcined at 400°C. Furthermore, the positive effect of thermal treatment may reduce the oxidation state of Au3+ to Au0 in the active sites [48]. Conversely, the amount of Au0 of catalysts calcined at 500 and 600°C did not follow the same trends since the intensities of the Au0 species decreased significantly. The reason for this phenomenon was unclear. Further investigation is necessary for the elucidation of the structure with high calcination temperature over Au catalysts. Fig. 10 (a)–(f) shows the TEM images of the Au/CeO2 catalysts. The Au particles can be seen as dark spots on the supports. The mean particle sizes of Au of 1, 3, and 5wt% were 2.82, 4.86, and 10.04nm, respectively. The results agreed with many previous characterization results, where the 5wt% Au/CeO2 catalyst has the largest Au particle sizes compared to other Au loadings. Additionally, the mean particle sizes of Au, with calcination temperatures of 300, 400, 500, and 600°C, were observed to be 43.30, 10.04, 44.85, and 51.93nm, respectively. The catalyst calcined at 600°C had the largest Au particle size, resulting in lower catalytic activity. On the other hand, the catalyst calcined at 400°C represented the optimum Au particle size for providing the highest OSRM activity. This indicated that the optimum Au particle size, in the range of 10nm, can be used to identify the most promising catalyst for OSRM."
9,Deactivation testing,"3.4 Deactivation testing As illustrated in Fig. 11 , the catalytic performance of the 5wt% Au/CeO2 catalyst, calcined at 400°C, was investigated at an O2/H2O/CH3OH molar ratio of 1.25/2/1 under atmospheric pressure at 300°C for 168h. The methanol conversion dropped rapidly to 88.8% after 40h (compared to 100% at the beginning of the reaction); the conversion and selectivity remained steady and the average trend of H2 yield was 16.12%. Nevertheless, the average values of H2, CO, and CO2 selectivity were presented at 17.85%, 12.57%, and 69.58%, respectively, while CH4 did not present in the outlet gas composition until the end of the experiment. It could be inferred, that the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface and sintering, could occur during the reaction. Formerly, the Au/CeO2 catalyst had been reported to be an efficient catalyst for WGSR, which resulted in a lower amount of CO. Nevertheless, the CO selectivity of Au/CeO2 in this study was much higher than that of CuZnAl(Zr)—oxide catalysts [49]. In order to check the Au particle size after the OSRM reaction, the XRD pattern of the spent catalyst was recorded and presented in Fig. 1(c) along with a fresh catalyst for comparison purposes. Based on the XRD patterns of the spent catalyst from the stability test, a significant improvement in the diffraction of each peak—including Au(111), Au(200), and Au(220)—was observed compared to the fresh catalyst. This revealed that the cause of catalyst deactivation was the sintering—the only possible reason for this appearance—and could take place on the gold particles resulting in larger particle size. Ho and Yeung (2006) also observed the same results on Au/TiO2 where the rapid growth of Au particles greatly diminished the catalytic surface area, resulting in the loss in catalytic activity during CO oxidation [26]. In testing the stability of the prepared catalysts, we analyzed the amount of coke deposited on the spent catalyst (the TPO profile of the spent 5wt% Au/CeO2 catalyst is shown in Fig. 12 . Two distinct peaks of coke—the first, a low-temperature peak with high intensity at 274°C, and the second, a high-temperature peak with low intensity at 502°C—imply the presence of at least two types of carbonaceous species. Guisnet and Magnoux (2001) proposed a classification, depending on the reaction temperature and the type of reaction, for the coke formation on a catalyst surface [50]. The types of coke deposited—polyaromatic and non-polyaromatic—relating to the reaction temperature were discussed [51]. In these experiments, the difference in peak positions indicated an interaction between each type of coke deposited on the surface of the catalyst and the support. The first type was assigned to the oxidation of the poorly polymerized coke deposited on the metal particles, and the latter represented the highly polymerized coke deposited near the metal–support interphase [51]. The amount of coke deposited on the spent catalyst was approximately 0.75wt%. Consequently, the rate of carbon formation could be calculated as 1.031E−09molC/s-gcat. It should be noted that the amount of coke deposited on the metal was higher than that on the support. Faungnawakij et al. (2006) reported that CO could be the source of coke formation or carbonaceous deposition [2]. To support this, Armor et al. (2008) proposed the major pathways for coke formation [52]; which were not discussed in this paper."
10,Conclusions,"The OSRM performance was determined using a series of Au/CeO2 catalysts prepared by deposition–precipitation, synthesized without pretreatment, with the H2O/CH3OH and O2/CH3OH molar ratios at 2/1 and 1.25/1, respectively. The catalyst exhibited high hydrogen yield and methanol conversion in the low-temperature range (200–300°C) and the main products of the reaction were CO2, H2, and CO. The highest Au loading (5wt%) and calcination at 400°C were considered to be the optimal conditions, which gave 100% methanol conversion and 24.5% H2 yield without a metal sintering effect. These catalysts, however, lost activity during the stability testing (168h) as a result of coke formation and the metal sintering effect."
