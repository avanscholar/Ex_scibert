0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been identified as an alternative energy carrier to generate power for domestic, industrial, and automotive purposes [1–5]. It has great potential to change the world's energy sector, similar to what the computer and the internet achieved in the modern information technology sector [6]. Hydrogen offers many advantages as an alternative energy carrier, one of which is the energy content of hydrogen (118MJkg–1 at 298K), which is much higher than that of most fuels (e.g., gasoline 44MJkg–1 at 298K) [7]. Furthermore, the use of hydrogen can mitigate the issues associated with the use of fossil fuels: CO2 and other greenhouse gases [8–13]. Hydrogen, in the form of hydrocarbons and water, is one of the most readily available elements on our planet. It can also be produced by various methods, such as thermal, electrolytic, and photolytic processes from fossil fuels, biomass, and water [14–18]. Water is considered a long-term source for the production of hydrogen due to its wide availability. The production of hydrogen from water can significantly reduce the depletion of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions [19–22]. Hydrogen can be produced from water by various methods, including water splitting and electrolysis. Water splitting can be carried out by a thermochemical process, chemical conversion of biomass, and photocatalytic water splitting [23]. In water splitting, the water is disassociates into hydrogen and oxygen by a series of consecutive chemical reactions. The conversion occurs in the temperature range 800–2000°C [24]. The heat required to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen may be generated by solar or nuclear power plants [25]. The major advantage of thermochemical method is that issues associated with various separation stages of the components can be avoided. Photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production is another promising method for the production of hydrogen from water [26]. Here, solar energy is converted into chemical energy, in the form of hydrogen, by using TiO2 as a photocatalyst [27]. In this technology, the oxidation and reduction reactions occur simultaneously. The major disadvantages associated with the use of TiO2 are wide band gap limits in the visible light region, frequent recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and higher overpotential for evolution [28]. Various steps have been taken to eliminate the disadvantages of TiO2; it has been coupled with a carbon material, surface modified with adsorbents, and TiO2 incorporated into nanoparticle [28]. Furthermore, an mesoporous TiO2 nanopowders has been prepared to enhance the catalytic activity, using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant-directing and pore-forming agent [27]. A metal-free, conjugated, semiconductor-based active polymeric graphitic carbon nitride g-C3N4 photocatalyst was developed for the photocatalytic H2 production [29,30]. The performance of g-C3N4 was enhanced by metal doping, metal deposition, and incorporation of a carbon compound [31] The photocatalytic performance was increased by an appropriate band structure formation at the heterojunction interface [32,33]. The modified Pt-loaded g-C3N4 exhibited a considerable improvement in the photoreduction [31]. Water electrolysis is a well-developed technology for the conversion of water into hydrogen and oxygen at low temperatures [34–37]. Electrolysis can be distinguished according to the type of electrolyte used in the electrolyzer. The two main water electrolysis technologies to produce hydrogen are alkaline electrolysis [38–42] and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis [43–45]."
1,Conventional electrolysis,"1.1 Conventional electrolysis 1.1.1 Alkaline electrolysis In alkaline electrolysis, the most commonly used anode and cathode materials are nickel- and cobalt-based oxides, respectively, and the most commonly used liquid electrolyte is 30–40% KOH [46,47]. The electrolyte is circulated through the electrodes to provide the alkalinity required by the system. The anode and cathode chambers are separated by a porous diaphragm which conducts hydroxyl ions but not hydrogen and oxygen [46,48,49]. The diaphragms are made of ceramic oxides such as asbestos and potassium titanate, or polymers such as polypropylene and polyphenylene sulfide [50–53]. Typical alkaline water electrolysis operates at a current density of about 400mAcm–2, at moderate temperatures of 70–90°C, with a cell voltage in the range 1.85–2.2V, and conversion efficiencies in the range 60–80% [54]. The advantages of alkaline electrolysis are that it does not depend upon a noble metal catalyst for the hydrogen production and handling is easy due to the relatively low temperatures [55]. 1.1.2 Proton exchange membrane electrolysis In PEM electrolysis, the anode and cathode catalysts are typically IrO2 and Pt black, respectively [56,57]. An acidic membrane is used as solid electrolyte (Nafion, DuPont) instead of a liquid electrolyte (The membrane conducts H+ ions from anode to cathode, and separates hydrogen and oxygen that are produced in the reaction. The PEM electrolyzer can operate at a current density of 2000mAcm–2 at 90°C, at about 2.1V [58]. The kinetics of the hydrogen and oxygen production reaction in PEM electrolysis are faster than in alkaline electrolysis due to the acidic nature of the electrolyte and the metal surface of the electrodes [59]. PEM electrolysis offers safety due to the absence of caustic electrolyte [60]. One of the advantages of PEM electrolysis is the possibility of using high pressure on the cathode side, while the anode can be operated at atmospheric pressure [61]."
2,Technology and cost problems associated with conventional electrolysis,"1.2 Technology and cost problems associated with conventional electrolysis During electrolysis, the oxygen produced at the anode is frequently in contact with the air. The liquid KOH electrolyte is highly sensitive to CO2 in the ambient air [62–64]; hydroxyl ions react with the CO2 and K2CO3 is formed [62,65]: CO 2 + 2 OH − → CO 3 + 2 H 2 O CO 2 + 2 KOH → K 2 C O 3 + H 2 O The formation of K2CO3 reduces the performance of alkaline electrolysis. This is due to several factors. 1. This reaction reduces the number of hydroxyl ions present in the anolyte that are needed for the anodic reaction [66]. 2. It also reduces the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte due to modification of the electrolyte composition [62]. 3. The K2CO3 precipitates in the pores of the gas diffusion layer (GDL), blocking ion transfer [67,68]. Therefore, the overall performance of electrolysis is reduced when using KOH liquid as an electrolyte. Furthermore, the hydrogen is stored at high pressure in the cathode compartment, which is not possible with liquid KOH [69–71]. On the other hand, although PEM electrolysis is efficient, the Nafion membrane, which is used in this type of electrolysis, is highly acidic (equivalent to 10–20% H2SO4) [72]; it therefore limits the choice of suitable catalyst material to the noble metals [73–75]. Nafion-based membranes that are commonly used in PEM electrolysis are very expensive. Furthermore, the conductivity of the membrane is reduced by the release of impurities from the feed water in the cathode compartment. Impurities bind to the active sites of the membrane in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) [76–78]. Furthermore, the stack materials are more expensive than the stack materials used for alkaline electrolysis [79]."
3,Polymeric anion exchange membranes,"1.3 Polymeric anion exchange membranes Over the past few years, polymeric anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have been developed for electrochemical system applications. They offer benefits for both PEM and alkaline electrolysis, and for fuel cells [80]. AEMs have been used for alkaline fuel cells but to date not for electrolysis [81–84]. The main difference between alkaline and AEM electrolysis is the replacement of the conventional diaphragm with an AEM in alkaline water electrolysis. AEM electrolysis offers several advantages. 1. A transition metal catalyst is used instead of a noble metal (platinum group metal; PGM) as catalyst. 2. Distilled water or a low concentration of alkaline solution can be used as electrolyte instead of concentrated KOH. 3. The quaternary ammonium ion-exchange-group-containing membrane that is used in AEM electrolysis is less expensive than the Nafion-based membranes. 4. The interaction between CO2 and the AEM is low due to the absence of metal ions in AEMs. 5. Furthermore, the absence of a corrosive liquid electrolyte in this technology offers advantages such as the absence of leaking, volumetric stability, ease of handling, and a reduction in the size and weight of the electrolyzer. Overall, AEM technology is low cost and highly stable for hydrogen production [85]. The specifications, advantages, and disadvantages of the major electrolysis techniques are summarized in Tables 1 and 2."
4,Anion exchange membrane electrolysis,"1.4 Anion exchange membrane electrolysis AEM electrolysis is a developing technology. Many research organizations and universities are actively involved in this research, largely due to its low cost and the high performance it offers [72]. However, compared to the other conventional electrolysis technologies, few research articles (<20) have been published on AEM electrolysis. AEM electrolysis still requires further investigations into the following, for example: power efficiency, membrane and catalyst stability, ease of handling, and reduction of cell cost [72,85]. Significant improvements are still required in the development of an AEM-based electrolyzer to ultimately contribute to a future hydrogen-based economy. Therefore, a thorough review of topics related to AEM electrolysis is considered necessary, for example: AEM electrolysis performance; operating parameters; and the components used for the electrolyzer, such as membranes, ionomers, electrocatalysts, and, overall, the MEA. This review of currently available literature identifies gaps that exist in the research, and hence areas in which further investigation and development are required."
5,Layout,"1.5 Layout This review article is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the theory of AEM electrolysis and the basic principles involved. Section 3 describes the components of AEM electrolyzers, including the membrane, ionomer, electrocatalyst, and the MEA. Section 4 describes the performance of the AEM electrolyzer, as characterized under various operating conditions. Section 5 addresses the modeling of AEM electrolysis. Section 6 presents a summary and outlook of the state of the art of AEM technology. Finally, suggested AEM electrolysis research areas, and suggestions for future research and development are given in Section 7."
6,Basic principle of anion exchange membrane electrolysis,"AEM electrolysis is the electrochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen with the assistance of an AEM. Fig. 1 illustrates the AEM process and its components. An external power supply is connected to the anode and cathode to provide a DC supply. The overall reaction consists of two half-cell reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Water is circulated through the anode side where it is reduced to form hydrogen and hydroxyl ions by the addition of two electrons. The hydroxyl ions diffuse through the AEM to the anode section by the positive attraction of the anode, while the electrons are transported to the anode through the external circuit. In the anode chamber, the hydroxyl ions recombine as water and oxygen by losing electrons. The oxygen forms as bubbles and is released from the surface of the anode. Both half-cell reactions require catalytic activity to form and release the respective gases from the electrode surfaces. The following half-cell reactions apply [72]: Anode : 4 O H − → O 2 + 2 H 2 O + 4 e − E 0 = 0 . 401 V Cathode : 4 H 2 O + 4 e − → 2 H 2 + 4 O H − E 0 = − 0 . 828 V Overall : 2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + O 2 E 0 = 1 . 23 V The overall reaction requires 1.23V theoretical thermodynamic cell voltage to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen at 25°C. However, in practice, the requirement of the cell voltage for efficient hydrogen production is >1.23V. The additional voltage is required to overcome both the kinetics and ohmic resistance of the electrolyte and components of the electrolyzer. Typical operational cell voltages for alkaline and PEM electrolysis are 1.85–2.05V and 1.75V at 70–90°C [86]."
7,Anion exchange membrane electrolyzer components,"Developments pertaining to the main electrolyzer components, such as the membrane, ionomer, electrocatalyst, and MEA, and their effects on electrolysis performance, are now reviewed. Table 3 shows the components of the MEA, the operating conditions, and subsequent maximum current density obtained at a particular voltage."
8,Anion exchange membranes,"3.1 Anion exchange membranes The AEM is one of the chief components that determines the performance of an electrolyzer. The function of the AEM is to transport hydroxyl ions from cathode to anode, and to act as a barrier for electrons and gases that are produced by the electrochemical reaction [85]. The AEM is composed of a polymer backbone coupled with anion exchange functional group. Generally, the polymer backbone is polysulfone (PSF) or polystyrene cross linked with divinylbenzene (DVB), and the ion exchange groups are –NH3 +, –RNH2 +, –RN+, =R2N+, –R3P+, –R2S+, or quaternary ammonium salts [85]. The desirable properties of an efficient AEM include high mechanical, thermal, and chemical stability, ionic conductivity, and barrier action with respect to electrons and gases. The polymer backbone is responsible for mechanical and thermal stability. The functional group is accountable for the ion exchange capacity, ionic conductivity, and transport number. Both the polymer matrix and the functional groups together determine the chemical stability [87]. The synthesis of an AEM with high mechanical stability and high ionic conductivity is challenging. The addition of excess ion exchange groups may increase the ionic conductivity, but it leads to loss of mechanical strength due to excessive water uptake. The AEM then becomes chemically unstable due to hydroxide attack on the fixed ion, which leads to poor ionic conductivity. Another major limitation of an AEM is degradation of quaternary ammonium groups by nucleophilic substitution and the Hoffmann elimination reaction (displacement of CH3 by OH–), which may reduce the conductivity of the membrane [85]. Alkaline polyelectrolyte membranes have recently been used in AEM electrolysis. The first DFT-principles of DFT calculations, development of these membranes, and their properties, such as ionic conductivity, stability, and degradation, are now discussed. 3.1.1 First-principles DFT calculations A comprehensive theoretical study of the hydroxyl ion (OH–) transport mechanism through an AEM was investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) by Yang et al. [88]. The study was carried out for the quaternary-ammonium-functionalized polystyrene (QAPS), coupled with OH−. The first-principles method based on DFT calculations was performed by using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs [89]. In an AEM electrolyzer, the hydroxyl ions are generated by the HER at the cathode, then diffuse through the AEM to the anode. In the AEM, the OH– ions are fixed on one side of trimethylamine through three bifurcated hydrogen bond between –CH3 and OH–. The binding energy of the hydrogen bond is 47.1kcalmol–1, which is very high, and it has strong interaction towards OH–. Hence, the OH– moves towards the hydrogen bond spontaneously due to the interaction. The authors explored the relationship between ion transport and rotation of C–CH2 bond linking with the QA groups. The transition state of the rotation minimum is around 180° between the potential energy barrier and QA groups. The calculated energy barriers are given in Fig. 4 of literature [88]. The OH– moved to between two QA groups due to the rotation of the C–CH2 single bond and transition state structure. The rotation energy barrier was 4.1kcalmol–1 when the system was under vacuum, which is lower than the water solution. However, the reverse rotation energy barrier in water solution (35.5kcalmol–1) was much lower than the vacuum. The authors concluded the above process is the rate-determining step of the OH– into the QAPS-AEM. The simulation results were in good agreement with the results of Takaba et al. [90] and Chen et al. [91]. According to Clark and Paddison [92], the side chain connectivity also plays an important role in the ion exchange process in the AEM. Therefore, three –CH2 units were added between the two side chains of –(CH3)3. The binding energy of a hydrogen bond between OH− and –(CH3)3 in the model was 41.9kcalmol–1, which was higher than the rotation energy barriers (10.9kcalmol–1). The OH– was traverse across the functional group following the rotation of the QA group by hydrogen bonding. When the length of the adjacent side chain was long, the hydroxyl ion transport was slow. This was due the lower degree of chloromethylation of the polymer matrix and the lower conductivity of the AEM [93,94]. 3.1.2 Alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes An alkaline polymer electrolyte membrane is generally composed of a polymer that conducts hydroxyl ions. Cationic functional groups are grafted onto the polymer backbone. Fig. 2(a) shows the quaternary ammonium group grafted onto a PSF backbone [95]. A commercially available polymer electrolyte that is commonly used in AEM electrolysis is A-201 (Tokuyama Corporation, Japan). Fig. 2(b) shows the structure of an A-201 membrane, with associated hydroxyl ions on the functional groups [96]. The backbone of A-201 is a linear hydrocarbon and the functional groups are quaternary ammonium groups. Besides the above, several other polymer backbones and functional groups for AEMs have been developed and tested for AEM electrolysis. The polymer backbones include PSF, chloromethylated low-density polyethylene (LDPE), methylated melamine, and poly(vinylbenzyl chloride). Functional groups such as 1-azabicyclo-[2.2.2]-octane and 1-methylimidazole have been investigated [97,98]. 3.1.2.1 Ionic conductivity The ionic conductivity of an AEM plays a significant role in the performance of the AEM. Higher levels of hydroxyl ion conductivity allow much higher current densities to be achieved. The ionic conductivity of A-201 in the HCO3 – form is 12mScm–1 at 25°C [96]. Parrondo et al. [99] developed and characterized AEMs with a backbone of chloromethylated PSF with various cationic functional groups: quaternary benzyltrimethylammonium (PSF-TMA+ OH–), quaternary benzyl quinuclidium 1-azaoniumbicyclo-[2.2.2]-octane (PSF-ABCO+ OH–), and quaternary benzyl-1-methylimidazolium (PSF-1M+ OH–). These cationic ion exchange groups are functionalized on the benzyl position of the PSF polymer matrix in the chloride ion form. The ionic conductivities were calculated and results for the three different exchange groups were compared. The ionic conductivities of the PSF-ABCO+ OH–, PSF-TMA+ OH–, and PSF-1M+ OH– at 60 and 80°C were 12, 15, and 16, and 5, 14, and 20 mS cm–1, respectively. Ionic conductivity of PSF-TMA+ OH– and PSF-1M+ OH– increased with increasing temperature, but that of PSF-ABCO+ OH– decreased. Membranes containing a PSF backbone with TMA+ OH– exhibited highest conductivity. Cao et al. [98] synthesized a methylated melamine grafted poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) (mm-qPVBz/Cl−) membrane. The melamine was used as an amination reagent. When the temperature was increased from 25 to 60°C, the ionic conductivity of the membrane increased from 16 to 27mScm–1, while the resistance of the membrane decreased from 0.62 to 0.37Ωcm2. Faraj et al. [97] prepared a LDPE-based AEM by a UV-induced grafting method. The quaternary ammonium sites with 1,4-diazobicyclo-(2.2.2)-octane (Dabco) were grafted on the LDPE backbone. The ionic conductivity recorded at 30, 45, and 60°C was 14, 19, and 25mScm–1 (in the form of HCO3 –/CO3 –). 3.1.2.2 Stability The stability of the membrane is one of the crucial factors that determine whether or not a membrane is suitable for AEM electrolysis. The stability of a membrane is commonly examined by keeping the current density constant for a particular period while the voltage is being monitored. Variation in the voltage reflects whether the membrane is stable or unstable; an increasing voltage indicates membrane instability. A possible reason for the instability of a membrane is degradation of the polymer backbone or the ion exchange groups. The commercially available Tokuyama A-201 membrane is reported to be stable for 600h at 100mAcm–2 at 50°C [100]. Parrondo et al. [99] reported PSF AEMs with quaternary benzyl ammonium and imidazolium groups to be stable at a constant current density of 400mAcm–2. The performance was then monitored over a period of 6h, during which time the cell voltage was increased from 1.6 to 2.4V. The increase in voltage could be the reason for the degradation of the polymer backbone or the loss of anion exchange groups. However, in post-mortem analysis, it was observed that no degradation of the ion exchange group had taken place. Degradation of the polymer backbone was subsequently cited as the possible reason for CO2 interruption. Faraj et al. [97] investigated the UV-induced grafting of vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC) with Dabco. They determined the stability by running the electrolysis at 460mAcm–2 for 500h. The cell potential increased by 6mV per day and the resistance increased from 0.30 to 0.43Ωcm2. A possible reason for the increase in cell potential was loss of the quaternary ammonium sites from the backbone due to the strong alkaline environment. Xiao et al. [101,102] also monitored the stability of a quaternary ammonium PSF membrane at 70°C. They found the cell potential to be stable (1.8–1.85V) over a period of 8h. Ayers et al. [103], using the Fenton's reagent test, observed the degradation of hydroxyl ions after 5h performance. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were also used to determine the stability of the polymer. The membrane was monitored over periods of 0, 2.5, and 5h. The membrane remained physically intact, but spectral analysis revealed signal losses associated with SO2, C–O–C, C–N, and HCO3 –. This provided an indication of the degradation of the polymer backbone of the membrane. Cracks, observed by optical microscopy, also indicated degradation. Nonetheless, the membrane survived for 5h in the aggressive alkaline medium. Faraj et al. [97] monitored the stability of the LDPE-g-VBC-Dabco membrane over a period of 500h and found that it exhibited better stability than some other membranes. The stability and ionic conductivity of the LDPE-g-VBC-Dabco membrane were reduced due to the alkalinity, the degradation of the polymer backbone or the ion exchange functional groups, or both. Parrondo et al. [99] confirmed the degradation of the polymer backbone; however they did not explain the mechanism of the degradation or the interaction between hydroxyl ions in the polymer backbone and the fixed cation exchange groups. Overall, the performance and stability of the LDPE-g-VBC-Dabco membranes were considered satisfactory. Although the hydroxyl ion conductivities achieved in some polymers are adequately high, the stability of the AEM is lower than the level required for the commercialization of AEM electrolysis. Further research is essential for the development of new polymers with more stable functional groups and with high ion exchange properties."
9,Ionomers,"3.2 Ionomers Ionomers are binders that assist in creating transport pathways between the membrane and the reaction sites in the catalyst layer. PSF is the most widely used alkaline ionomer due to its thermal and chemical stability [104]. The ionic conductivity of the ionomer can be improved by increasing the number of ion exchange groups in the polymer matrix. The main challenge associated with an increase in the number of ion conductive groups is that the water uptake also increases, which leads to dissolution of the ionomer in the solvent at elevated temperatures. The addition of cross-linkers to the polymer matrix may increase the strength of the polymer chain, but it may also reduce the chain mobility and void volume. However, the addition of an unsuitable cross-linker restricts the hydroxide mobility by forming short-chain cross-linking [105]. The stability and performance of the ionomers used in AEM electrolysis are now discussed. Wu and Scott [106] developed a hydroxide ion conductive ionomer for AEM electrolysis. They synthesized poly 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate; 2,2,2,-trifluoroethyl methacrylate; and butyl methacrylate (DMAEMA-co-TFEMA-co-BMA) by co-polymerization followed by quaternization and evaluated performance in AEM electrolysis. The mechanical properties of the MEA present in the ionomer were characterized. The Young's modulus and elongation rupture point were 0.229GPa and 48.6%, respectively. The conductivity of the quaternized poly(DMAEMA-co-TFEMA-co-BMA) membrane containing 26mol% DMAEMA increased from 15 to 25mScm–1 when the temperature was increased from 20 to 50°C. The membrane containing 41mol% DMAEMA exhibited higher conductivity than a membrane with 21mol% DMAEMA; conductivities as high as 59mScm–1 at 50°C were achieved with the former. The stability was examined at 100mAcm–2. The cell voltage was 1.9V and the voltage was reasonably stable over a period of 5h. Leng et al. [72] determined the stability of the MEAs with the AS-4 ionomer (Tokuyama Corporation, Japan) and the aminated Radel PSF (A-Radel) ionomer. The MEAs was prepared using the catalyst-coated substrate (CCS) technique. The maximum electrolysis performance achieved was 399mAcm–2 at 1.80V with high frequency resistance (HFR) of 0.23Ωcm2. The current density was constant for the A-Radel ionomer for up to 317h, whereas the current density of AS-4 ionomer was stable for only 40h. The lifespan of the MEA with the AS-4 ionomer was only 27h. Investigations were therefore carried out to determine the reason for the degradation. When the anolyte was changed from distilled water to 1M KOH, the cell voltage decreased significantly, from ~2.55 to ~1.58V, and the HFR decreased from 1.24 to 0.27Ωcm2. The most significant finding, however, was that the performance of the MEA recovered when changing from distilled water to KOH. This indicated that the degradation of the MEA was either due to membrane/ionomer or to the catalyst layer. The reason for the decrease in HFR remain unclear. In summary, the A-Radel ionomer exhibited much higher stability than the AS-4 and DMAEMA. Development of durable ionomers with high ionic conductivity is required. More detailed evaluation of performance and stability are also required, prior to wider application in AEM electrolysis."
10,Electrocatalysts,"3.3 Electrocatalysts The theoretical thermodynamic potential for water electrolysis is 1.23V [107]. However, both the OER and HER require an electrocatalyst to overcome the kinetics of the reaction. Selection of a suitable electrocatalyst is necessary to reduce the overpotential requirement of the electrolysis. Conventional PEM and alkaline electrolysis require noble metals (Ir, Ru, and Pt black) as catalysts, which increases the cost of electrolysis [43]. Therefore, the development of a non-noble metal catalyst is crucial to reduce the cost of AEM electrolysis. Attempts have been made to find less costly transition metal catalysts for AEM electrolysis [85]. Currently, IrO2, Ni, Ni-Fe alloys, graphene, Pb2Ru2O6.5, and Cu0.7CO2.3O4 are used as OER catalysts, while Pt black, CuCoOx, Ni-Mo, Ni/CeO2-La2O3/C, Ni, and graphene are used as HER catalysts. An electrocatalyst is expected to be stable in oxidative and reductive environments. Various techniques can be used to apply the catalyst to the membrane, gas diffusing layer, or current collector. Recently, Pavel et al. [85] developed and evaluated AEM electrolysis using low cost transition metal catalysts. The commercial catalysts Acta 4030 (Ni/CeO2-La2O3/C) and Acta 3030 (CuCoOx) (Acta SpA, Italy) were used as HER and OER catalysts. The loadings of the HER and OER catalysts were 7.4 and 36mgcm–2, respectively. These catalysts were designed to withstand relatively mild alkaline conditions (pH 10–11). The authors explained the effect of HER loading on the kinetic contribution and performance of the AEM electrolysis. The catalyst loading range selected for HER was 0.6–7.4mgcm–2. The OER catalyst loading was kept constant at 36mgcm–2. The results obtained for different catalyst loadings are presented in Fig. 3 [85]. The resistance recorded for the catalyst range 0.6–7.4mgcm–2 was 0.218–0.136Ωcm2. This study revealed that the HER catalyst loading strongly affects the cell potential. The peak potential varied from 2.1 to 2.4 for the catalyst range 0.6–7.4mgcm–2. The peak area and the peak time were linearly related to the catalyst loading. In a study carried out by us [108], we made use of the commercially available catalyst Acta 3030 (CuCoO)x for the electrochemical characterization. The electrocatalytic activity was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in an inert atmosphere. Thin film RDE (rotating disc electrode) measurements of the ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) in an O2-saturated electrolyte were performed at different rotation rates for different catalyst loadings. The results were normalized to the amount of catalyst on the electrode and the surface area of the electrode in order to calculate the catalyst mass and specific activities, which are the accepted measures of true ORR catalytic activity. Koutecky–Levich analysis of data obtained from RDE experiments was also performed in order to determine the kinetic parameters of the ORR number of electrons transferred and the heterogeneous rate constant. The mass activity and specific activity were high in the catalyst loading range 0.05–0.1mgcm–2. The Koutecky–Levich plot was a straight line, which indicates first-order rate kinetics. The 2e– pathway electron transfer was more predominant than the 4e– at lower catalyst loading. The catalyst was moderately stable in alkaline conditions. The reaction rate constant was high, at 0.05mgcm–2. Parrondo et al. [99] studied AEM electrolysis with low cost OER electrocatalysts. PGM catalysts such as Pt black and Ru perchlorate were used as HER and OER catalysts. Lead-ruthenium oxide pyrochlore was selected as the OER catalyst instead of the conventional IrO2 because the cost was only 8% of that of the IrO2. The catalyst ink Pt black was applied on the carbon paper (CP). Ru was deposited on the porous media electrode as a gas diffusing electrode (GDE). The loading of both catalysts was around 2.5mgcm–2. Xiao et al. [101] used electrocatalysts such as Ni-Fe and Ni-Mo complexes for the HER and OER to fabricate MEAs. Ni-Fe complexes are known to be the best non-noble metal catalysts for the OER in alkaline media [109]. The Ni-Fe catalyst was uniformly spread on a hot porous electrode. Specifically, a solution containing Ni and Fe nitrates was sprayed onto the hot porous electrode substrate by the electrochemical codeposition method. A negative current was applied to the substrate to achieve uniform distribution of catalyst. Here, the porous electrode was made entirely from Ni-Mo, instead of coating a Ni-Mo layer for the HER. The reason for this is that a thick Ni-Mo layer can lead to high ohmic potential loss. The Ni-Mo solution was filled in the stainless steel skeleton at 500°C under a H2 atmosphere. The loading of both the catalysts was 40mgcm–2. The electrocatalysts were stable for 8h. Ayers et al. [103] characterized AEM electrolysis technology for low cost electrolysis. One of the main objectives of their work was to understand the possibility of using non-noble metal complexes as catalysts. They studied the ternary catalysts 30% Ni-Fe/C, 30% Ni-Fe-Co/C, and 30% Ni-Fe-Mo/C. Their results are presented in Fig. 4 [103]. The 30% Ni-Fe/C catalyst showed the best results. They then compared their results to results for the conventional catalyst IrO2 and found that the cell voltage was much higher than with IrO2. The electrolysis performance with non-noble metal catalysts was significantly lower than with noble metal catalysts. Ahn et al. [110] used Ni particles as HER catalyst. The Ni particles were deposited on CP using cathodic electrodeposition at the optimized conditions of 95V for 50s to obtain high electrochemical activity. Extremely small quantities of Ni were used (8.5μg Ni cm−2). Evaluation of the HER and OER electrocatalytic activity of the Ni/CP showed that the CP without Ni was inactive in the KOH electrolyte. The HER and OER characteristics were then evaluated by CV. It was concluded that the electrochemical activity was affected by the electrochemical surface area and structural defects. Wu and Scott [111] evaluated a CuxCo3O4 nanoparticle OER electrocatalyst for AEM electrolysis. The catalyst was prepared by thermal decomposition. They investigated the catalyst reaction mechanism, stability, and electrolysis performance. The HER and OER catalysts were Pt/C and nano-size CuxCo3O4 with loadings of 3 and 2mgcm–2. The catalyst ink was prepared and coated on both sides of the membrane. The stability of both the catalysts was evaluated using CV; the initial and 200th cycles were compared for CuxCo3O4. Only insignificant differences were observed after the 200th cycle. The CuxCo3O4 was considered more stable than the other compound (Co3O4) in the catalyst. It met the requirements for an OER catalyst in AEM electrolysis. AEM electrolysis in which CuxCo3O4 was used showed better performance than when Co3O4 was used. The resistance for Co3O4 was 0.23Ωcm2, whereas the resistance for CuxCo3O4 was 0.3Ωcm2. The authors suggested that the overall resistance was due to lack of contact of catalyst layer and catalyst membrane interface. Recently, graphene has attracted much attention due to the absence of noble metals in the conventional catalysts. Graphene-based catalysts were developed to replace the conventional noble metal catalysts [112]. The former offer high specific surface area, chemical and electrochemical stability, high conductivity, and low cost [113]. Nitrogen atom doping of graphene, induce the changes in the asymmetry spin density of the carbon lattice and local charge density [114]. Recently, nano-ribbon network doped with nitrogen, dual-doped graphene-carbon nanosheets as a sandwiched graphene, combination of a graphene oxide (GO) and copper-centered metal organic framework were found to be active for both OER and HER [114–116]. Yang et al. [115], developed a metal-free three-dimensional graphene nano-ribbon network doped with nitrogen. The fast electron transport between the reaction sites was attributed to interconnected graphene networks. Zhang et al. [117], worked on mesoporous carbon foam co-doped with nitrogen and phosphorus. The activities of the OER and ORR were examined, independently, in a three-electrode configuration. DFT calculation confirmed that the N and P co-doping and graphene edge effects are essential for the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. Li et al. [114], developed nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped graphene-carbon nanosheets as a sandwiched graphene, a few layers thick. The excellent bifunctional catalytic performance is attributed to the synergistic effects between the doped N and P atoms and the high conductivity of the incorporated graphene. Johan et al. [116], investigated the combination of a graphene oxide (GO) and copper-centered metal organic framework. The catalyst showed a superior trifunctional catalytic activity for the OER, ORR, and HER. The power density attained by the catalyst was 76% that of the commercial Pt catalyst. Liang et al. [118], reported a hybrid material constituting Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on reduced GO as a high-performance bifunctional catalyst for the both the ORR and the OER. However, the catalytic activity was surprisingly increased by the nitrogen doping of graphene due to the coupling of CO3O4 and graphene. All of these graphene-based electrocatalysts showed excellent catalytic activity and superior stability in alkaline conditions. Velan and coworkers [119] and Joe et al. [120] also investigated AEM electrolysis; they used the graphene oxide-(GO-)modified platinum-free metal electrode. Graphene was adopted for AEM electrolysis because it had already been used effectively in Li ion batteries and many electrochemical systems [121,122]. The electrochemical activity of the electrode was examined by chronoamperometry for the OER reaction at 30°C. The activity of the electrode was compared to that of the bare Ni foam, NiO foam, and the GO-coated NiO foam. It was observed that the graphene-coated NiO foam provided a higher current density for the OER reaction due to an increased contact area. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies also confirmed that the GO-coated NiO showed better charge transfer and ion diffusion characteristics. It was also found that the contact resistance was a function of temperature; there was a decrease in resistance with an increase in temperature, due to the hinting improvements in electrochemical properties. The stability of the electrode was monitored continuously for 24h at 80°C in 5.36M KOH at 1.9V; the change in voltage appeared to be insignificant. In conclusion, the GO-coated electrode showed a higher current density and better performance than a non-GO-coated electrode. In summary, both the HER and OER are sluggish under alkaline conditions with the non-PGM catalysts that have been studied to date. Two types of non-PGM catalysts were evaluated, Acta 4030 and Acta 3030, and the Ni alloy catalyst. The Acta 4030 and Acta 3030 exhibit better performance than the Ni alloy catalyst. The 30% Ni-Fe alloy catalyst exhibits better performances than the other Ni alloy compounds. Most of the research to date has focused on the OER electrocatalyst. The activity, stability, and low cost offer promise that this graphene-based catalyst could be alternative to the conventional AEM electrolysis catalysts. Further research into the catalytic activity kinetics, and the stability and use of both the OER and HER electrocatalysts is required."
11,Membrane electrode assembly and electrolyzer performance,"3.4 Membrane electrode assembly and electrolyzer performance The MEA is the core of AEM water electrolysis. The MEA comprises the AEM, ionomer, anode and cathode catalyst layers. The MEA is generally fabricated by the catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) method or the CCS method [123,124]. In the CCM method, the homogeneous ink is a mixture of an electrocatalyst and a binder, such as a PTFE solution and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The ink is applied to both sides of the AEM (e.g., by spraying) and dried. It is then placed between the GDLs and subjected to mechanical or hot pressing. On the other hand, in the CCS method, the electrocatalyst ink is directly deposited on the GDLs and then sintered to form the electrode (GDE). The AEM is housed between both the GDLs or GDEs and hot pressed to form the MEA [72]. The MEA is the chief component that determines the performance of the electrolyzer. The electrolyzer performances, based on the MEAs used by various researchers, are now discussed. Pavel et al. [85] fabricated the MEA by the CCS method. The A-201 was used as AEM. The Acta 4030 and the Acta 3030 were used as the HER and OER catalysts, with loadings of 36 and 7.4mgcm–2, respectively. The membrane was placed between the catalyst-coated GDLs and mechanically pressed with a filter press to form the MEA. Electrolysis experiments were carried out at 43°C and 0.1MPa. The maximum performance achieved by the cell was 470mAcm–2 at 40°C with voltage ranging between 1.9 and 2.01V. Leng et al. [72] developed and evaluated AEM water electrolysis in a solid state cell. The MEA was fabricated using both the CCS and CCM methods. An A-201 AEM and conventional OER and HER noble metal catalysts such as IrO2 and Pt black were used to improve the reaction kinetics. The OER and HER catalyst loadings were 2.6 and 2.4mgcm–2, respectively. The catalyst-coated AEM was held between Ni foam and carbon cloth and mechanically pressed to form the MEA. MEAs were prepared using two different ionomers (AS-4 and the A-Radel) and the performances evaluated. The flow fields were single serpentine flow channels on graphite end plates on the cathode side and titanium parallel channel end plates on the anode side. Deionized (DI) water was used as electrolyte at a flow rate of 3mLmin–1. The experiments were carried out at 50°C. The maximum performance of this electrolysis system was 399mAcm–2 at 1.80V with a high frequency resistance of 0.23Ωcm2. Parrondo et al. [99] prepared a MEA using an inexpensive PSF AEM membrane and an inexpensive OER electrocatalyst. A PGM catalysts, such as Pt black and Ru perchlorate, were used as HER and OER catalysts. The catalyst, Pt black ink, was applied on CP. Ru pyrochlore was deposited on the porous media electrode as GDE. The loading of both the catalysts was about 2.5mgcm–2, with about 30wt% binder. The membrane was sandwiched between the two electrodes, no mechanical and thermal pressing was applied. Electrolysis experiments were carried out at 50°C. The absence of CO2 was maintained by bubbling with N2. The ultrapure water was supplied as anolyte and catholyte at 400mLmin–1. Xiao et al. [101] used an alkaline polymer electrolyte (self-cross-linking PSF) for AEM water electrolysis. Electrocatalysts such as Ni-Fe and Ni-Mo complexes for HER and OER were selected for fabrication of the MEA. A Ni-Fe catalyst was uniformly spread on the hot porous electrode by the electrochemical codeposition method. The porous HER electrode was made entirely of Ni-Mo, instead of only coating with the Ni-Mo. The loading of both the OER and HER catalysts was 40mgcm–2 and the achieved current density was 400mgcm–2 at 1.7V. Ahn et al. [110] prepared a MEA using the A-201 AEM with an extremely small amount of Ni catalyst (8.5μg Ni cm–2). The catalyst was deposited on CP by a direct electrodeposition method and it was sandwiched between CPs. When a 1.0M KOH solution was supplied to the cathode, the performance of the electrolyzer was 150mAcm–2 at 1.9V. Faraj et al. [97] prepared a MEA using the LDPE-g-VBC-Dabco membrane for AEM electrolysis. Acta 4030 and Acta 3030 were used as HER and OER catalysts respectively. The membrane was housed between the anode and cathode GDL. The electrolyzer performance was 460mAcm–2 at 2.1–2.2V. The membrane was stable over an observation period of 500h; there was no significant change in voltage at 460mAcm–2. Wu and Scott [111] prepared a MEA using a membrane (50µm) with quaternary ammonium functional groups for the OER, nano-size CuxCo3O4 for the HER, Pt/C, and catalyst. The catalyst loading was 2 and 3mgcm–2. The catalyst ink was prepared and coated on both sides of the membrane by the CCM method. The performance was 100mAcm–2 at a voltage of 1.8V. In another study, Wu and Scott [106] used a catalyst that they had used in previous work (Cu0.7CO2.3O4 and Co3O4) and nano-size Ni. The current collector meshes were covered by the catalyst ink. The loading of the anode and cathode was 2 and 3mgcm–2, respectively. The MEA was soaked in 1M KOH solution to convert the chloride form to the hydroxyl form. Experiments were carried out at 20–30°C. The performance of the electrolyzer was very poor; the current density achieved was 100mAcm–2 at 1.9V. In our work, the MEA was prepared by the CCS method. The Acta 3030 and Acta 4030 were employed as OER and HER catalysts. The anode catalyst layer was prepared using homogenous inks composed of Acta 3030, DI water, IPA, and I2 ionomer solution (Acta SpA, Italy) The cathode catalyst ink was a mixture of Acta 4030 and IPA, amorphous fluropolymer (AF) solution (DuPont, USA), and DI water. The well-dispersed anode catalyst ink was brush coated on Ni foam. The cathode catalyst ink was sprayed on the microporous CP with a spray gun (Iwata, Japan). Both the GDEs were dried at 80°C for 2h. The anode GDE was sintered at 340°C for 30min and the cathode GDE was sintered at 300°C for 2h, simultaneously. The catalyst loadings for the OER and HER were 30 and 7mgcm–2, respectively. The AEM used in the electrolyzer was A-201. The membrane was pretreated by soaking overnight in the 1M KHCO3, then rinsed with water to remove any residue. The membrane was sandwiched between both the anode and cathode GDEs. The MEA was housed between the single-path titanium and graphite serpentine flow channels. The entire cell was mechanically tightened to ensure intimate contact between with the MEA components. The effective area of the MEA was 5cm2. Experiments were carried out at 60°C. The performance of the electrolyzer was comparable with results of Pavel et al. [85]; the achieved current density was 500mAcm–2 at 1.89V. Recently, Zeng and Zhao [125] carried out pioneering work in AEM electrolysis. They introduced a new method, referred to as I2MEA (integrated inorganic membrane electrode assembly), for AEM water electrolysis. They elected to use an inorganic material containing a Mg-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH), which contained a combination of inorganic ions and fixed cations. The I2MEA method was chosen for two reasons. The first was to avoid using the conventional AEM preparation process. Conventional AEM synthesis typically includes chloromethylation, bromomethylation, quaternizataion, and alkalization, but these processes are time consuming, chemicals are highly toxic, and cryogenic conditions are required. Second, in conventional AEM, the cationic functional group in the polymer matrix is degraded by nucleophilic substitution and Hoffmann elimination. The LDH offers higher hydroxyl ion conductivity and stability under alkaline conditions. The Acta 4030 and Acta 3030 catalysts were used as HER and OER catalysts respectively with a loading of 40mgcm–2. The catalyst slurry was coated on the LDH, then sandwiched between Ni foam and CP. This was followed by hot pressing at 120kgcm–2 for 15min 70°C. The flow rate of the electrolyte was maintained at 2mLmin–1. Using this new I2MEA method, the maximum current density achieved was 205mAcm–2 at 2.2V and 70°C. The stability was monitored at 80mAcm–2 for 600h. There was a slow decay rate of 100 μV h–1. This means that the hydroxyl ions were moving by a structural diffusion mechanism, assisted by the carbonate ions in the interlayer region. The conductivity was stable for about 200h. Pandiarajan et al. [126], fabricated MEA with Fumasep® (FAA-3-PK-130; Fumatech, Germany). The catalyst loadings of the anode and cathode were 3.5mgcm–2 of Ce0.2MnFe1.8O4 and Ni powder, respectively. The performance achieved by the system was 300mAcm–2 at 1.8V. The stability of the MEA was estimated under a current density of 200mAcm−2 at room temperature for 100h. The cell voltage increased with time. The stability of the Ce0.2MnFe1.8O4 and MnFe2O4 was investigated by running chronoamperometric responses at 2V (vs. RHE) by circulating DI water. There was no significant voltage drop observed in the performance of Ce0.2MnFe1.8O4 electrodes after 100h of operation. Electrolyzers with the I2MEA feature were studied under various operating conditions, specifically, at different temperatures, using different electrolytes, and employing membranes of different thicknesses. For membrane thicknesses of 300, 500, and 700µm, the corresponding internal resistances were 3.27, 5.11, and 7.39Ωcm2, respectively. The increase in thickness reduced the performance of the electrolyzer but increased the mechanical strength. Fig. 5 [125] shows the polarization curves of an AEM water electrolysis cell based on I2MEAs for membranes of various thicknesses. In summary, the cell performances and stabilities of various MEAs have been discussed. The MEA comprising an A-201 and LDPE-g-VBC-Dabco membrane with the Acta 4030 and Acta 3030 HER and OER catalysts exhibited the best performance. Introduction of the new I2MEA method by Zeng and Zhao [125] offered a great improvement; the performance of electrolyzer was comparable to that of the A-201 AEM. Nonetheless, further research into the characterization of the MEA is required, including analysis of impedance, determination of the transport mechanism, and degradation analysis, towards, ultimately, the development of new MEA systems."
12,Operating conditions,"The performance of an AEM electrolyzer is strongly dependent on the operating conditions. For AEM electrolysis, the operating parameters are cell voltage, current density, temperature, pressure, and choice of the electrolyte, all of which are now discussed."
13,Current density,"4.1 Current density In electrolysis, the cell voltage and the current density are critical operating parameters. The cell voltage determines the energy requirements and efficiency of the cell. The current density is the result of the hydrogen production. A higher current density implies a faster electrochemical reaction. An AEM electrolyzer operates in the current density range 100–500mAcm–2. One of the challenges that running at a higher current density presents is bubble formation on the electrode surface. This is because it increases the overpotential required. Therefore, the most suitable operating current density must be between the optimum hydrogen production and electrical energy efficiency."
14,Operating temperature,"4.2 Operating temperature The operating temperature is another important operating parameter. The AEM electrolyzer is designed to operate at temperatures between 50 and 80°C. An increase in temperature increases the rate of the electrochemical reaction and reduces the overpotential. Pavel et al. [85] investigated the effect of temperature on electrolysis performance; studies were carried out at 30, 40, and 50°C for a current density of 470mAcm–2. Fig. 6 [85] shows the polarization curves recorded at the different temperatures. As expected, the cell potential decreased with increasing temperature. This data was comparable with the data of Leng et al. [72]. Leng et al. and Ahn et al. [72,110] carried out investigations in the temperature range 50–70°C. As expected, cell voltages gradually decreased with increasing temperature. Furthermore, the calculated activation energy from the Arrhenius equation compared well with literature values. Scott et al. [98] reported the electrolyzer performance for temperatures of 25, 40, and 55°C. As expected, the performance increased with increasing temperature due to the lower activation overpotential. The starting potential was 1.5V at a current density of 250mAcm–2, but it decreased to 100mAcm–2 at 1.9V. The large overpotential was due to the membrane and the electrode resistance. Zeng and Zhao [125] also investigated the effect of temperature on the electrolysis performance at 50, 60, and 70°C. They used the I2MEA. Fig. 7 [125] shows the effect of temperature based on the I2MEA. The performance significantly increased with increasing temperature, as expected, due to the increased hydroxyl ion conductivity and activity of the catalyst."
15,Operating pressure,"4.3 Operating pressure An AEM electrolyzer generally operates at pressures up to 3MPa [85]. At higher pressure, the ohmic potential is reduced due the gas bubbles generated during the electrochemical reaction. However, the pressure does not significantly affect the performance of the electrolysis cell. Ahn et al. [110] investigated the effect of compression pressure on the cell voltage. The electrolysis cell was compressed by tightening the screws. The applied pressures were then 3.5, 4.1, 4.8, and 5.5MPa. Chronoamperometric experiments were carried out and the current–voltage data recorded after 1min, for a constant current density of 20mAcm–2. The cell voltage initially decreased due to the reduction of the contact resistance and then it increased drastically. The authors suggest that this may have been due to poor transport of the hydrogen and oxygen in the electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, the highly compressed CP might not allow a path for the escape of the hydrogen and oxygen. Both the hydrogen and oxygen might be trapped inside the MEA and block the active sites of the catalyst. This behavior has been reported elsewhere in the literature [127,128]. On the other hand, at the low pressure of 3.5MPa, the cell showed poor performance due to poor transportation of hydrogen and oxygen. For the Ni/CP system, the authors identified the optimal compression pressure that yielded the highest cell performance to be 4.1MPa."
16,Electrolyte,"4.4 Electrolyte The electrolyte plays a vital role in electrocatalytic activity and largely determines the performance of the electrolyzer. An electrolyte that has a high concentration provides good ionic conductivity. Conventionally, a 30–40% concentration of KOH is used as electrolyte. In AEM electrolysis, DI water, ultrapure water, 1wt% K2CO3, 1wt% K2CO3/KHCO3, and 1M KOH have all been used as electrolytes. Pavel et al. [85] compared the performances of electrolyzers of different electrolytes: 1% K2CO3/KHCO3, 1% K2CO3, and 1M KOH (pH values 11.2, 10.2, and 14). Fig. 8 [85] shows the polarization curves for the various electrolytes. The cell potential was 1.79V at a constant current density of 470mAcm–2, and the resistances were 0.152, 0.132, and 0.087Ωcm2. The resistance for 1M KOH was lower than for the other electrolytes. Zeng and Zhao [125] also evaluated the performance of an electrolyzer, based on their I2MEA, with various electrolytes: 0.1M NaOH, 0.1M Na2CO3, 0.1M mixture of 0.08M Na2CO3 + 0.02M NaHCO3, 0.1M NaHCO3, and DI water. The pH values ranged from 12.63 to 8.51. The voltages obtained using the different electrolytes, at 208mAcm–2, were 1.725V, 1.845V, 1.944V, 2.099V, and 2.5V, respectively. Fig. 9 [125] shows the polarization curves for the various electrolytes based on I2MEAs. The internal resistances were 3.27, 4.36, 5.44, 8.39, and 17.92Ωcm2, respectively. The results suggest that the internal resistances are a strong function of the pH value. It was also observed that the rate constant of the OER decreased with decreasing hydroxyl ion content. Hence, it appears that both these observation reduce the performance of the electrolyzer. Faraj et al. [79] carried out experiments at 460mAcm–2 current density; the voltages of the electrolytes 1M KOH, 0.1M K2CO3, and KHCO3 were 1.78, 1.88 and 1.9V, respectively. DI water has been used as electrolyte by several researchers. Leng et al. [72] ran experiments at 399mAcm–2 and obtained a voltage of 1.8V. Scott and coworkers [111] ran experiments at 100mAcm–2 and obtained a voltage of 1.9V. Sivakumar and coworkers [120] ran experiments at 90mAcm–2 and obtained a voltage of 2V. Parrondo et al. [99] and Xiao et al. [101] used ultrapure water as the electrolyte at 400mAcm–2 and recorded cell voltages of 1.8V and 1.85V. In other studies, Wu and Scott [106] and Ahn et al. [110] used 1M KOH as the electrolyte at 100 and 150mAcm–2 and recorded cell voltages of 1.8V and 1.9V. In summary, the operating conditions of AEM electrolysis, including current density, temperature, operating pressure, and electrolyte, have been discussed. The lowest voltage was obtained at 400mAcm–2 when 1M KOH was used at 80°C, with a screw pressure of 4.1MPa. The corrosive nature of 1M KOH and the chance of interaction between KOH and CO2 in ambient air are very high. The voltage difference between 1M KOH and 0.1M K2CO3 was found to be 0.07V at 40°C. Indications are therefore that the 1M K2CO3 electrolyte is the best option for AEM electrolysis. The voltage difference in the 40–60°C range is only 0.09V. Much heat energy is required to run at higher temperatures. Therefore, the optimal operating conditions at 400mAcm–2 are 0.1M K2CO3 electrolyte at 50°C, with screw pressure 4.1MPa."
17,Modeling of AEM electrolysis,"Zeng and coworkers [129] modeled AEM electrolysis. Because AEM electrolysis involves many physicochemical processes, including electrochemical reactions, and mass and charge transport, understanding the process through experimentation alone is challenging. Zeng and coworkers [129] therefore developed a mathematical model to investigate the mass transport, charge transport, and electrochemical reactions. They determined the voltage loss and performance of AEM electrolysis by applying the effects of the current density, membrane thickness, and liquid saturation. For their modeling, they made the following assumptions: 1. Experiments are carried out under steady state and isothermal conditions. 2. The cathode layer is treated as a thin interface layer, since it is much thinner than the diffusion layer. The electrochemical kinetics are derived from the Butler–Volmer equation: OER: j a = i o , a { exp ( α a nF RT η a ) − exp ( − ( 1 − α a ) nF RT η a ) } HER: j c = i o , c { exp ( α c nF RT η c ) − exp ( − ( 1 − α c ) nF RT η c ) } where, i 0 , a is the anode exchange current density and η a is the anode overpotential ( 0 . 37 A m − 2 ) , i 0 , c is the cathode exchange current density and η c is the cathode overpotential ( 0 . 43 A m − 2 ) , E 0 is the standard voltage ( 1 . 229 V ) , α a is the anode transfer coefficient ( 0 . 5 ) , α c is the cathode transfer coefficient ( 0.5 ), R is the universal gas constant ( 8.314J mol − 1 K − 1 ) , and F is the Faraday's constant ( 96 , 485 . 3 A s mol − 1 ) . All the physiochemical and operating parameters were carefully selected and the model was validated experimentally. The membrane selected for use in their experiments had a PSF backbone with quaternary ammonium functional groups. It was sandwiched between the Ni-Fe and Ni-Mo electrodes. The experiments were carried out at 70°C. The effect of current density on the voltage is shown in Fig. 10 [129]. The efficiency decreased with increasing current density. This is because the total voltage loss comprises the activation loss of the two electrodes and the ohmic loss, and it is proportional to the current density. To achieve an optimal rate of hydrogen production and efficiency, the operating current density must be optimal. The higher exchange current density resulted in a reduction in voltage and higher efficiency. The authors suggest that at higher exchange current densities the reaction kinetics are fast and, consequently, the activation loss may be low. Yet another important parameter of AEM electrolysis is the thickness of the membrane because it controls the hydroxyl ion transport. Fig. 11 [129] shows the effect of different membrane thicknesses on the current density (performance). The thickness of the membrane was increased from 35µm to 140µm. It is evident that the cell voltage increases with increasing thickness and, therefore, the overall efficiency of the electrolyzer is reduced. The explanation presented is that the thicker membranes has higher transport resistance. On the other hand, the thinner membrane shows lower transport resistance but it offers low mechanical strength. Therefore, the thickness needs to be optimized to achieve the best balance between good hydroxyl ion conduction and mechanical strength. Another study of Zeng and coworkers [129] addressed the effect of liquid saturation on the electrolysis performance. The liquid saturation strongly influences the physical parameters such as electrode porosity, wettability, permeability, and surface tension. The liquid saturation level was varied in the range 0.95–0.5. Fig. 12 [129] shows the effect of different saturation levels on the current density. The cell efficiency decreased with increasing cell voltage. This is because lower saturation reduces the number of active sites, thereby increasing the loss of catalytic activity. Studies carried out by Zeng and coworkers. [129] were particularly valuable; they modeled and then validated AEM electrolysis, for the first time. The numerical and experimental data matched within 2% error. They recommend that further developments in the areas of active electrocatalysts and highly conductive hydroxyl ion AEMs are required. An increase in membrane thicknesses eventually results in an increase the resistance. Unfortunately, here, the authors did not provide much information of the increase in overall resistance."
18,Summary and challenges,"AEM electrolysis technology is still at an early stage of development. In this article we have presented an overview of the current state of low cost hydrogen production by AEM electrolysis. We have discussed the basic components of the AEM electrolyzer, such as the AEM, electrocatalyst, ionomer, and MEA, and electrolyzer performance. Recent developments (since 2011) have been critically reviewed. To date, the best performance achieved by AEM electrolysis is 500mAcm–2 at 1.8V, for the following system: A-201 membrane, and OER and HER catalysts such as Acta 3030 and Acta 4030. The optimum operating conditions of AEM electrolysis were identified as 0.1M K2CO3 at 45°C, with a screw pressure of 4.1MPa. Nevertheless, AEM electrolysis technology still faces some challenges regarding the achievement of improved low cost production of hydrogen; there are still many problems to be overcome in this regard. Specific features/weak points of the current AEM electrolysis technology that require attention/improvement include the following: • Degradation of the AEM due to nucleophilic attack and Hoffmann elimination on the fixed cationic groups on the polymer matrix • Membrane and electrode deformation due to degradation of the quaternary ammonium functional groups • Lower conductivity of the hydroxyl ion than the proton conductivity • Degradation of the ionomer in the MEA • The potential drop, due to the excessive loading of non-noble metal catalyst at the anode • Lower performance of the transition metal catalysts than the noble metal catalysts, and lower catalyst utilization • Sluggish OER reaction when the number of hydroxyl ions is reduced in the electrolyte • Blocking of active sites of the catalyst at high pressure by hydrogen and oxygen trapped inside the MEA • Performances achieved with AEM electrolysis are still lower than with PEM electrolysis due to the higher internal resistance of the MEA • Performances of electrolytes such as distilled water, ultrapure water, and 0.1% K2CO3 are lower than the performance of 1M KOH."
19,Recommendations for future research,"There are still several development challenges in AEM electrolysis that should be addressed prior to its general acceptance and future large-scale introduction. • Development of improved anion conductive polymers (membranes and ionomers) Development of anion conductive polymers (membrane and ionomers) with high conductivity, hydroxyl ion selectivity, and stability (mainly at temperatures >60°C), and lower gas crossover is essential. The following novel AEMs are suggested: radiation red – coli grafted AEMs [130], AEM blends with imidazolium-functionalized and sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) [131], AEMs cross-linked with polar electron-donating linkers [132], and an AEM made of styrenic diblock copolymer with a quaternary-ammonium-functionalized hydrophilic block and a cross-linkable hydrophobic block [133] can also be tried An understanding of the interaction between the hydroxyl ions, polymer backbone, and quaternary ammonium functional groups is necessary in order to avoid undesirable nucleophilic attack and Hoffmann elimination. Furthermore, characterization of the properties of AEMs under AEM water electrolysis conditions, by means of polarization, EIS, chronoamperometry, and gas crossover analysis is required. • Development of improved hydroxyl ion conductivity The hydroxyl ion conductivity could be increased by the addition of nanoparticle fillers and blends [134]. However, the development of ionomers may be slow, largely due to the toxic nature of many ionomers. A non-toxic, high ionic conductivity, thermally and chemically stable ionomer should be developed for AEM electrolysis. • Development of the OER and HER Most of the OER catalysts are based on the composition of Ni and a rare earth metal. Use of Ag-alloy-based and Ni-Cr-based catalyst may be considered for the OER [135]. New, highly efficient electrocatalysts, such as nanorod-shaped Co3O4 anchored on multi-walled carbon nanotubes should be developed and be used together with diethylenediamine as OER catalyst [136]. Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on reduced GO were found to be a synergic catalyst for OER [118]. This could perhaps also be considered for use in AEM electrolysis. The development of HER catalysts also requires attention. Low cost HER catalysts with enhanced catalytic activity, catalyst utilization, and stability are required for the HER. • Physical and electrochemical characterization of the MEA Physical and electrochemical characterization of the MEA should contribute to a better understanding, and later the enhancement of, hydroxyl ion transport through the MEA. The membrane degradation mechanism between the anode and cathode needs to be understood. Furthermore, interaction between the membrane and ionomer and cross-linking at the interface should be investigated. Development of a MEA with improved water management and thermal stability is also required. Development of advanced physical and electrochemical characterization tools, such as current interruption, current mapping, and EIS techniques is essential. Development of both empirical and physical predictive relations for operating parameters should also be addressed. • Industrialization and commercialization of AEM electrolysis AEM electrolysis is a developing technology for small-scale on-site hydrogen production. This small-scale AEM electrolyzer can produce hydrogen up to 1Nm3H2 h−1 [60]. Use of the AEM electrolyzer avoids the requirement of a compressed hydrogen storage cylinder (10Nm3 H2). Acta SpA (Italy) commercially launched a portable electrolyzer for rack-mountable applications. The high-purity hydrogen produced from this AEM electrolyzer can be used for various applications, such as fuel gas for flame applications, e.g., soldering and brazing metals, glass, quartz and crystal. Another major application is inflation of meteorological balloons. However, the electrical energy requirement for the small-scale electrolyzers are higher than the medium- and large-scale electrolyzers. This is because the auxiliary equipment, such as the pump, control panel, valves, etc., consume the major portion of the electrical consumption. The size of the electrochemical cell is less significant as regards electricity consumption. In spite of more efficient and reliable technology now being available, remains subject of further research and development, for commercialization and industrialization. To conclude, AEM electrolysis with non-noble metal catalysts will reduce the capital cost of the entire system. However, the overall performance of AEM electrolyzer must be increased to further reduce the total cost of hydrogen production."
