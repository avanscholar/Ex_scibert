0,Introduction,"With the aid of microfluidics tools, several advantages, performing the biodiesel synthesis in microscale have been reported by researchers, as compared to the conventional process, notably the short residence time to achieve high conversions (Rahimi et al., 2014; Santacesaria et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2010; Guan et al., 2009; Wen et al., 2009). Transesterification of vegetable oils (i.e., reaction between vegetable oils and short chain alcohols, methanol or ethanol, in the presence of catalysts) occurs typically with excess alcohol to shift the reaction balance towards the products. After reaction, this excess alcohol can be removed and recovered in order to be returned to the beginning of the process. In the macroscale, this procedure normally happens in evaporators or even in distillation columns. Also in microscale, current works focus on the synthesis of biodiesel in microreactors, and its purification is carried out in conventional laboratory equipment. In the microscale, due to the particularities of this scale, microchannels can be used to remove excess alcohol through its evaporation from the chain of transesterification reaction products. This evaporation process involves a transfer of heat to the product chain joined by a phase change of the alcohol from liquid to gaseous state. This change requires a great amount of heat added at a constant temperature (McCabe et al., 2005). In this sense, the use of heat micro-exchangers can be a viable alternative for the alcohol evaporation, since they allow a large amount of heat to be indirectly transferred, and that this transference is almost constant during the process (Wibel et al., 2011; Schurbert et al., 2001). Heat micro-exchangers are defined as devices that contain two systems of microchannels, in which there is the passage of hot fluid in one system and cold fluid in the other. In each passage, there is an indirect transfer of heat from the hot to the cold fluid, i.e. without fluid contact. Research studies demonstrates the effectiveness of using heat micro-exchangers in the cooling of electronic components (Zhang et al., 2014; Oueslati et al., 2008; Gillot et al., 1999), air conditioning systems (Han et al., 2012), evaporation of R134a refrigerant (Wibel et al., 2011), oxidation of carbon monoxide in synthesis gas (Delsman et al., 2004), fractional crystallization (winterization) of biodiesel (Kerschbaum et al., 2008), among others. Normally, the fluid that provides heat to the cold fluid is water. In the case of evaporation of alcohol, the function of this hot fluid is to provide energy for the liquid alcohol molecules to turn to gaseous state. However, this energy can be supplied to the system in another way, with Peltier modules. These modules are composed of thermoelectric pairs that are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel, integrated between ceramic plates (Rowe, 1995). The thermoelectric pairs are formed by doped semiconductor materials, of the n-type (excess of electrons) and the p-type (shortage of electrons). This junction enables the Peltier modules to be used for heating or cooling, thanks to the combination of four effects: Seebeck, Peltier, Thomson and Joule effect (Rowe, 1995; Chávez et al., 2000). The Seebeck effect occurs when an electric potential is generated within a semiconductor material subjected to a temperature gradient. The Peltier effect consists of the release or absorption of heat when an electric current passes through two different conductors. The Thomson effect happens when the amount of heat within a conductor in a temperature gradient changes with the passage of an electric current. Finally, there is the Joule effect, which is basically a heating in a conductor by the passage of an electric current. The combination of these effects allows the construction of modules (herein called Peltier modules or Peltier plate) which present the following characteristics: they do not have moving parts; they can be used in applications that require little physical space; they can be used for heating or cooling according to the direction of the electric current; and, they require no fluids for this heating or cooling process. Peltier plates have been applied in the areas of neuroscience (Morizane et al., 2012), agriculture (Muñoz-García et al., 2013), energy (Najafi and Woodbury, 2013; Casano and Piva, 2011), among others. Maltezos et al. (2005) reported the use of Peltier plates in the cooling and heating of water nanoliters and the possibility of producing chemical reaction systems with individual temperature control. In that study, they managed to change and control the temperature in the system within a range of −3 to 120°C, with good thermal stability. Given this, this article reports the development of a microchannel heat exchanger, which allows the separation of excess alcohol from the biodiesel chain, using a Peltier module as a source of thermal energy. The microdevice was designed using the AutoCAD software and built using the soft lithography technique. Before the tests of alcoholic evaporation in microchannels, we developed a heating system based on Peltier module that allowed us to obtain the thermal energy and to control the temperature in the microdevice. This system was used to study the evaporation of excess alcohol from biodiesel in microchannels. Three variables were assessed in the process: temperature, fluid flow rate in the microdevice and the alcohol/biodiesel molar ratio. The temperature range was 80–120°C, which is above the boiling point of ethanol (78°C) and below the flash point of biodiesel (i.e., lowest temperature at which biodiesel releases vapor to become a flammable mixture) (ASTM D6751-15, 2015). The flow rate was specified between 0.1mLmin−1 and 1.2mLmin−1. The molar ratio of ethanol was specified according to the stoichiometric ratio of the transesterification reaction, which indicates that it takes three moles of ethanol for one of oil, but as this reaction is typically carried out with excess ethanol we used a range of 2–11moles of ethanol/biodiesel molar ratio, which would correspond to a 5–14 ethanol/oil molar ratio."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials For the tests of evaporation of excess alcohol from biodiesel, ethyl alcohol (Dynamic >99.5%) was used. We use a pure biodiesel (B100) donated by the Federal University of Amazonas’ Laboratory of Fuels (LAPEC)."
3,Production of devices,"2.2 Production of devices Fig. 1 shows the microdevice used in the experiments. It has longitudinal length of 30mm and 210μm in height. The number of channels was equal to 15 and the width of each channel was 0.5mm, with a 0.5mm separation between them. The length of each channel was 20mm (Fig. 1a). The microdevices were manufactured in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) using the soft lithography process in the Microfabrication Laboratory (LMF) of Brazilian Nanotechnology National Laboratory (LNNano – Campinas/SP, Brazil) (Moreia et al., 2009). The heat micro-exchanger produced (Fig. 1b) has one input and two outputs (upper and lower Output) located in the same longitudinal position (Fig. 1c). This setting allows the output of the gas and liquid phases through different places."
4,Experimental system,"2.3 Experimental system The experimental system developed for the heating of the microdevice from a Peltier plate consists of a voltage source, which provides a potential difference (V), a temperature sensor (located on the upper surface of the microdevice), a digital controller for the temperature (model MTB48, LOTI – accuracy ±0.5% F.E. and ±1 digit) of the microdevice and of the Peltier plate (model HTC-50-12-15-4) and a syringe pump (model 74905-54, Cole-Parmer – accuracy of ±0.355% and reproducibility of ±0.05%). The experimental system is presented in Fig. 2 . Temperature control and adjustment were carried out using a thermal power station, which contains the digital temperature controller, an input to power the voltage source and an output to power the Peltier plate. The temperature sensor used allowed to measure the temperature on the entire upper surface of the microdevice. Thus, the temperature measured and considered in the tests was a mean of the temperature of the microdevice. This measured temperature was used by the controller to perform the process control. The controller compared this temperature to the desired temperature (temperature of the evaporation process). If the measured temperature were below the desired temperature, the controller sends a signal to the voltage source to send more current to the Peltier plate and in that way the temperature rises to the full extent of the Peltier plate. Likewise, if the temperature of the microdevice exceeded a specified value, the temperature controller acted at the source to reduce the temperature. 2.3.1 Temperature variation as a function of the voltage To assess the heating efficiency of the Peltier plate, we obtained a temperature distribution as a function of time in the voltages from 1 to 6V. Each measurement was performed for 50min. This temperature distribution was assessed for the Peltier plate and for the microdevice/Peltier plate set. 2.3.2 Temperature variation in the system as a function of the flow After the temperature behavior analysis, we observed the temperature variation in the microdevice with flow rate. The fluid used was ethyl alcohol, which was pumped through a syringe pump at 1.2mLmin−1. The temperatures assessed were 35, 50, 67 and 100°C using a voltage of 9V."
5,Experimental procedure,"2.4 Experimental procedure To study the evaporation of ethanol from the biodiesel, 50mL of the ethanol/biodiesel mixture were pumped to the microdevice previously heated at the temperature specified using the syringe pump at a constant flow rate. Samples of liquid ethanol were collected at the output (both, out-up and out_down) of the exchanger in a glass flask and were immediately weighed on an analytical balance. This collection prevented possible drops of liquid from being drawn by the vapor and interfering in the measurement of the tests. The analysis of the efficiency of the process was determined through a material balance of the system, as shown in Fig. 3 . According to Fig. 3, the material balance for the mass that enters and leaves the system boundary can be written as follows: (1) m = m V + m ′ where m is the total mass that enters the system, mv is the mass of the ethanol vapor (considering that under the conditions studied only ethanol evaporates) and m′ is the liquid mass of ethanol and biodiesel. The total mass (m) that enters corresponds to the sum of the mass of ethanol (me ) and biodiesel (mB ) on the ethanol/biodiesel molar ratio: (2) m = m e + m B In the lower output, the material balance is equal to: (3) m ' = m e l + m B l where mel is the mass of liquid ethanol and mBl is the mass of biodiesel. As we are considering that biodiesel does not evaporate under the conditions studied (80–120°C), the mass of biodiesel in the input is equal to the output: (4) m B = m B l In the upper output, Eq. (5) gives the vapor mass generated in the system: (5) m V = m e − m e l Rearranging Eqs. (2) and (3), using the equality of Eq. (4) and substituting in Eq. (5), we have: (6) m V = m − m ' which is equal to Eq. (1) and tells us that the vapor mass is obtained from subtracting the mass that leaves through the lower output from the total mass that enters the system. Therefore, the process efficiency was evaluated from the mass loss: (7) M a s s l o s s ( % ) = m − m ′ m"
6,Design of experiments and statistical analysis,"2.5 Design of experiments and statistical analysis A central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was used to analyze the effect of the variables in the ethanol evaporation process. The values of the variables were chosen considering the boundaries of the process and are presented in Table 1 . The experiments performed using this approach had a central point that was performed in triplicate that allowed an estimation of the error and axial points that determine the quadratic terms of the mathematical model used in the data modeling. The experimental data on the efficiency of evaporation were modeled by a second degree polynomial equation: (8) Y ′ = β 0 + β 1 x 1 + β 2 x 2 + β 3 x 3 + β 12 x 1 x 2 + β 13 x 1 x 3 + β 23 x 2 x 3 + β 11 x 1 2 + β 22 x 2 2 + β 33 x 3 2 where Y’ is the response (Mass Loss), β 0 is the average of the data, β i and β ii are the linear and quadratic regression coefficients, β ij are the second interaction coefficients and x1, x2 and x3 are the factors (variables). The program used for the treatment of the data was Statistica 7."
7,Results and discussion,"The process of evaporation of the alcohol from biodiesel in a heat micro-exchanger can be influenced by the temperature of the system, the fluid flow rate and the ethanol/biodiesel molar ratio. The heating system in heat exchangers is usually done with the aid of hot fluids that exchange heat with the fluid to be heated. Here, we developed a thermal source based on a Peltier module allowing us to perform the separation of alcohol from biodiesel using the evaporation process in heat a micro-exchanger without the use of hot fluids."
8,Peltier module as heat source,"3.1 Peltier module as heat source To assess the temperature variation as a function of time, we measured the temperature for various voltages in two settings: for the Peltier and for the microdevice/Peltier plate without internal flow. These results are shown in Fig. 4 . In Fig. 4 we can observe a relationship between the applied voltage and the maximum temperature achieved, and the higher the voltage the greater is the temperature measured in the two settings. This behavior is to be expected and is in accordance with the work of Maltezos et al. (2005). We can also note that there is a loss in relation to the maximum temperature measured when we assess the temperature distribution in the two systems. When the system comprises only the Peltier plate, the maximum temperature achieved was 153°C, and in the microdevice the temperature was 92°C for the voltage of 6V. This difference is associated with the different thermal resistance of the materials. In the microdevice/Peltier plate assembly, the continuous heat flux that is emitted by the plate passes through the glass of the microdevice (sealing material) and by the microchannels composed of PDMS. Despite the reduced thickness of the materials, the different conductivities reduce the obtained temperatures. This means that the greater the thickness of the microdevice, the greater must be the voltage provided so that high temperatures can be achieved. To analyze the stability of the temperature when there is a fluid flow in the microdevice, we analyzed different temperatures at a flow rate of 1.2mLmin−1. Fig. 5 shows the variation of the temperature as a function of time in a voltage of 9V. The results indicated temperature stability at the range of time studied; for low temperatures (35°C) there were practically no variations, and for 50 and 67°C there were minor variations around the specified values, especially in the early moments. This may be related to the fact that in the initial time, when the fluid flow starts, there is a disturbance in the microdevice, causing the decrease of temperature in the system. The controller, then, needs to provide more energy to the system at that time, in an attempt to stabilize the temperature specified. This process increases the temperature of the system, which is then corrected by the controller. At the temperature of 100°C, the system could only keep the temperature in the microdevice in the first minute and after this time the temperature was approximately 90°C. This is related to the energy supplied to the system. As shown previously, the voltage influences the heating directly, thus the voltage applied was not enough to keep the temperature at 100°C."
9,Alcohol evaporation in the heat micro-exchanger,"3.2 Alcohol evaporation in the heat micro-exchanger To assess the effect of the variables of temperature, fluid flow rate and ethanol/biodiesel molar ratio in the evaporation process, we used a CCRD (23), with 6 axial points and 3 repetitions at the central point, which amounts to 17 tests. Table 2 presents the responses of the mass loss (%) for the variables assessed. We can see that in the studied conditions in the evaporation process, the mass loss ranged from 9.89% to 82.16% and the central points indicate a small variation among themselves. From these results we calculated the effects of each variable in the ethanol evaporation process. The regression coefficients are presented in Table 3 . From Table 3, we can observe that the linear terms of temperature (x1), ethanol/biodiesel molar ratio (x3) and the interaction between them (x1×3) were statistically significant (p <0.05). The flow rate variable (x2), the quadratic terms and the interactions x1×2 and x2×3 were not statistically significant at the 5% significance level. In Table 4 we show the ANOVA calculations, in which we incorporated into the residues all statistically not significant terms but not the linear term of flow. Table 4 indicates that Fcalc for regression (3.68) is greater than the tabulated (3.2) and the percentage of variation explained by the model considering the linear terms of temperature, flow rate, ratio and the interaction of temperature and ratio was 80.59%. The model adjusted with these coded terms (x1, x2 and x3) is presented in Eq. (9). (9) Y ′ = 39.00 + 14.87 x 1 − 6.26 x 2 − 35.69 x 3 − 14.28 x 1 x 3 From the data presented above we can conclude that mass loss is strongly influenced by temperature and molar ratio. The increase in temperature results in greater mass loss of ethanol. The increase in the molar ratio has an opposite effect on the temperature, which means that with an increase in molar ratio there is a decrease in the efficiency of evaporation. This same behavior is observed in the variable flow rate, but the effect of the increase of this variable is lower when compared to the other variables. The influence of temperature on ethanol evaporation can be analyzed from the relationship between mass and heat of vaporization: (10) Q = m Δ H v a p → m = Q Δ H v a p where Q is the amount of energy related to the phase change (kJ), ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization of the ethanol at the system temperature (kJkg−1) and m is the mass of the substance vaporized (kg). From Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook (Perry, 1997), the enthalpy of ethanol vaporization is given by: (11) Δ H v a p = 5.69 × 10 7 ( 1 − T T c ) 0.34 where T is the temperature in Kelvin and Tc is the critical temperature (516.2K). In Eq. (10), we can observe that the evaporated ethanol mass presents a ratio inversely proportional to the enthalpy of vaporization. From Eq. (11), as the temperature is increased, the enthalpy of vaporization is reduced, as the critical temperature remains constant. Thus, with the decrease in enthalpy, we have an increase in evaporated mass, which might explain the increase in the efficiency of evaporation in relation to the increase in temperature for our system. To understand the relationship between flow rate and efficiency of evaporation, we can use Newton’s law of cooling/heating: (12) q s ″ = h Δ T ↔ Δ T = q s ″ h where q s ″ is the surface heat flow of the system (Wm−2), ΔT is the variation of temperature and h is the heat transfer coefficient (Wm−2 K−1). In Eq. (12), the heat surface of a system is proportional to the heat transfer coefficient, and the temperature variation (i.e., difference between the surface and the fluid temperatures) is inversely proportional. The relationship between heat transfer coefficient and fluid velocity can be expressed using the Nusselt number: (13) N u = h D k where D is the hydraulic diameter (m) and k is the thermal conductivity (Wm−1 K−1). Kalaivanan and Rathnasamy (Kalaivanan and Rathnasamy, 2011) investigated the heat transfer in microchannels using ethanol and methanol. They presented a correlation for the Nusselt number involving the Reynolds number (Re) and the Prandtl number (Pr): (14) N u = 0.949 R e 0.06 P r 0.4 Equating Eqs. (13) and (14), we can relate h with the Reynolds number. This tells us that for a Reynolds variation from 1 to 100, Prandtl number equal to 1, thermal conductivity of 0.18Wm−1 K−1 and hydraulic diameter of 2.96×10−4 m (smaller channels) the heat transfer coefficient ranged from 577 to 760Wm−2 K−1. This variation in the value of h, could explain why the flow rate variable was not statistically significant in the efficiency of evaporation in the range of values considered, as, with increased h, the variation in temperature would decrease (Eq. (12)), thus increasing the temperature of the fluid, considering that the surface temperature remains constant. The variation of h may not have been enough for a significant change in the temperature of the fluid. However, as we can see in Table 3, the flow rate has a negative effect on the efficiency of evaporation, which leads us to consider that another factor is involved in the process in addition to the variation of the heat transfer coefficient. From Eq. (10), we have that the evaporated mass is directly proportional to the amount of energy in Watt (W) in a second (s). With increasing flow rate, there is a decreased residence time of the fluid within the heat exchanger, which means that the fluid receives less power at a constant temperature, thus reducing the amount of energy related to the phase change and therefore interfering with the evaporated mass of ethanol. This is probably the best explanation for the effect of flow rate on the evaporation of alcohol. The most influential variable in the process was the ethanol/biodiesel molar ratio, and an increase in that variable significantly reduced the alcoholic evaporation. Moharana et al. (2017) studied the conversion from liquid to vapor of the ethanol/water mixture in microchannels for hydrogen production. An interesting result shown by the authors was the variation of the heat transfer coefficient as a function of a temperature difference for various volume fractions of ethanol. From the results presented, we can observe that the heat transfer coefficient decreases as the volume fraction of ethanol is increased. If we used Eq. (12), we would see that the variation in temperature would increase, thus increasing the difference between the surface and the fluid temperatures, which would interfere in the process of phase change. If this same behavior occurs in the ethanol and biodiesel mixture, with the increase in the amount of ethanol, the mass evaporated will be lower. In terms of heat transfer, the reduction of the heat transfer coefficient explains the behavior of the molar ratio with the efficiency of evaporation, if the ethanol/biodiesel mixture presents behavior similar to the ethanol/water mixture. We can analyze the nature of these mixtures through the thermodynamics of the mixture of non-ideal liquids. It is known that the ethanol/water mixture (as well as the ethanol/benzene and the ethanol/chloroform mixtures) presents a positive deviation from Raoult's law (Ball, 2014). Raoult's law says that the partial vapor pressure of a component in the mixture is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component at a given temperature multiplied by the mole fraction in the mixture. A positive deviation of this law tells us, in general, that the vapor pressure of the mixture is greater than that expected for an ideal mixture. This characteristic means that the molecules are more easily separated in the mixture than when they are in pure liquid. The molecular forces are more intense between equal molecules than between different molecules. In the case of evaporation of the ethanol/water mixture, analyzing a phase diagram containing the liquid and vapor phases as a function of temperature and pressure, as the concentration of liquid ethanol is increased (mass percentage, volume fraction, etc.) the concentration of vapor is increased. However, if we increase the concentration of liquid ethanol to above 95.6% of mass, the reverse behavior happens. With increased concentration of liquid, there is a reduction in the concentration of vapor, because of the increased energy required for the separation of molecules. Guo et al. (2007) studied the influence of the addition of ethanol in the vapor pressure of biodiesel from sunflower oil. They concluded that the biodiesel/ethanol mixture showed a positive deviation from Raoult's law. Thus, we can conclude that the ethanol/biodiesel mixture exhibits similar behavior to the ethanol/water mixture and, as Moharana et al. (2017) showed, the heat transfer coefficient decreases as the amount of ethanol is increased, thus increasing the variation in temperature between the surface and the fluid temperature. In addition to this fact, we can assume that the greater the amount of ethanol, the greater must be the power supplied to the fluid so that the molecules can go from liquid to vapor. As the energy remains constant, there is a decrease in the concentration of vapor when we increase the amount of liquid ethanol. This is more apparent when examining Fig. 6 ."
10,Comparison between the evaporation process in traditional equipment and microchannel heat exchanger with Peltier module,"3.3 Comparison between the evaporation process in traditional equipment and microchannel heat exchanger with Peltier module From the results presented, the microchannel heat exchanger with Peltier module showed a efficiency of 82% when an ethanol/biodiesel mixture is pumped at a flow rate of 0.6mlmin−1, temperature of 100°C and a molar ratio of 2 with a single passage through the microdevice (i.e., there is no reflux of any of the components in the microchannel). But how does this results compare with the traditional processes in the removal of alcohol from biodiesel? And why using Peltier module is more important to this process than an ordinary heat exchanger? First, let us take a little look at the process of separating alcohol from a mixture. The separation of the excess alcohol in biodiesel (i.e., the ethanol evaporation process) on a laboratory scale usually occurs in rotavaporators, e.g., Rotavapor R-300 from Cole-Parmer. On industrial scale this process is performed on distillation columns, e.g., methanol recovery column from Koch Modular Process Systems, LLC. The evaporation process in a distillation column occurs as follows: the mixture, in which the components to be separated, is introduced into one point of the distillation column (feed stage). The mixture will descend to the base of the column where it is heated by a heat exchanger, normally heated by water, to its boiling point. The resulting vapors of this process will rise in the column in feeling contrary to the mixture of the feed. These vapors will reach the top of the column and through a condenser, they are condensed and recovered and can return to the initial process or leave the column. Thus, it is observed that for the process of evaporation of a mixture to occur in a column the mixture needs to be heated, there must be an intimate contact between the ascending vapors and the descendent mixture (which occurs at defined height of the column – plates/stages) and the condensed vapors, which return to the column in the form of reflux. Dhar and Kirtania (2009) conducted a study on excess methanol recovery in continuous biodiesel production process using a distillation column. The results showed that it is possible to recover more than 80% of excess methanol. The mixture was fed at a temperature of 80°C in stage 5. The column had 10 stages and showed higher efficiency in a reflux ratio of 1 and methanol/oil molar ratio of 6. The authors concluded that the most important variable in this process is molar ratio, because the necessary energy increases with the increase of the molar ratio. This same behavior was observed in the microchannel heat exchanger with Peltier module. Santana et al. (2010) using the HYSYS simulator investigated the design of a biodiesel production plant using castor oil as feedstock and ethanol. The recovery of the alcohol was carried out in a distillation column under vacuum (reflux ratio equal to 2, number of stages of 3 and molar ratio of 12) to prevent biodiesel degradation. The recovery percentage of the unreacted ethanol was 79% in the second stage of the column and the ethanol was the top product with 99.88% purity. From these studies, it was concluded that high alcohol removal efficiencies can be obtained in these columns, but this occurs with reflux of the components in large columns that require considerable amounts of energy for the evaporation of the mixture and high contact between the liquid and gaseous phases. Using the characteristics of microdevices, e.g., high surface/volume ratio – approximately 20000m2 m−3, high heat and mass transfers among others (Whitesides, 2006; Wirth, 2013; Fogle, 2006), it is possible to obtain high efficiencies of the evaporation process even with a single passage by microchannel heat exchanger. The other advantage of our microdevice is the presence of the Peltier module. As previously mentioned, this plate can be used for heating and/or cooling or both. This means that microdevices can be developed in the future to allow the evaporation and condensation of fluids using the same Peltier plate, instead of using an evaporator and a condenser. In this lies the advantage of using Peltier plates rather than ordinary heat exchanger, such as electrical resistors."
11,Conclusion,"In this paper, we have shown the possibility of using heat micro-exchangers with a Peltier module on the separation of excess alcohol in biodiesel. Peltier modules were applied as thermal source instead of hot fluids and this enabled us to achieve different temperatures in the micro-exchanger. We assessed three variables in the evaporation process: temperature, fluid flow rate and alcohol/biodiesel molar ratio. The temperature positively influenced the evaporation/separation of alcohol; with an increase of this variable, the separation is greater. The flow rate and the molar ratio have an opposite effect on evaporation; their increase reduced the efficiency of the process. Thus, we have shown the possibility of using heat micro-exchangers on the separation of excess alcohol in biodiesel."
