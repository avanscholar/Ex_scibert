0,Introduction,"Due to limitation of fossil fuel sources and global warming, hydrogen is introduced as an alternative renewable energy. Use of hydrogen, as the lightest chemical element, offers ways to minimize greenhouse emissions, reduce air pollution, diversify energy supply, and reduce noise [1]. Large amount of hydrogen is being used as a basic raw material in the petrochemical industries. Especially, hydrogen has recently drawn tremendous attention as a green energy source in areas such as fuel cells. The hydrogen industry has aimed the diversification of feedstock and hydrogen production processes. Gaseous hydrocarbons such as methane, butane, kerosene, alcohols (e.g., methanol and ethanol), ketones and ethers (e.g., dimethyl ether) are the main feedstock in hydrogen production processes such as reforming reactions, partial oxidation reactions, and decomposition reactions. These reactions occur in the presence of a steam or carbon dioxide which is obtained through separation and purification processes [2–4]. According to international union of pure and applied chemistry (IUPAC), membrane reactor (MR) comprises of a reaction chamber along with a membrane to add reactants or to remove products of the reaction. MRs are examples of combining two processes, such as membrane separators and a chemical reactions in one stage [5,6]."
1,Scope of the current review,"1.1 Scope of the current review The main purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive research area encompassing hydrogen permselective membrane reactors with particular focus on palladium-based membranes. This review is divided into several sections including palladium membrane reactors, reactor types, classification of various reactions for hydrogenation, and Pd-alloy based on deposition methods. Introducing important parameters that can affect permeation rate and Sieverts’ law validity and an overview of the last decade researches on Pd-based membrane reactors are of other issues we have covered in order to shed light on the current trend of research. Finally, some new ideas are proposed to improve the performance of permselective membrane reactors for further investigations."
2,Evolution of membrane reactors,"1.2 Evolution of membrane reactors Fig. 1 (a) shows all the cited publications used in the present work by the years 2000–2017 and 34 publications before that period. Fig. 1(b) demonstrates the trend of all publications on Pd-based membranes for hydrogen purifications during the same period (there are also 119 publications before 2000). As can be seen, tremendous amount of research work has been carried out since 2000. In this paper, most of the work related to membrane reactors for production of hydrogen was done starting in 2004."
3,Membrane reactors,"1.3 Membrane reactors In 1784, the word “membrane” (meaning pellicle, capsule, diaphragm and thin parchment in Latin) was proposed by Nollet for the first time. He applied membrane for separation of liquid mixtures such as alcohol and water [7]. The first successful application of polymeric membrane systems for separating hydrogen from ammonia purge gas streams was conducted in 1970’s. Nowadays, application of hydrogen permselective membrane systems are widely developed in various industrial processes, involving reforming, gasification, or petrochemical processes [6]. For efficient use of hydrogen permselective membranes, a high hydrogen permeation flux should be allowed with a high selectivity. Resistance against temperature degradation and poisoning as well as sufficient sealing in the reactor are two other important features that a membrane should possess [8]. In highly supercritical gases (i.e., carbon monoxide, nitrogen and methane), hydrogen can be separated easily using polymeric membranes owing to its extremely high diffusivity to all other molecules except helium. When hydrogen solubility factor is not so significant, the diffusion contribution overcomes and overall high selectivity will gain. For instance, in some polyimide and polyaramide membranes, hydrogen/methane selectivities of about 200 have been reported [9]. In spite of the fact that membranes are widely used in industries in low temperature conditions for many years [10], the high temperature stability can be considered as an obstacle that limits the application of these membranes in hydrogen production reactors. However, there are several methods and figures in the literature [11–13], that apply membranes in high temperatures with some modifications. For industrial scale in high temperatures, long time thermal stability of membranes is vital, especially in steam methane reforming processes [11]. Membrane reactors are superior to conventional reactors (CRs) for the following reasons [9]: – High conversion of equilibrium limited reactions. – The possibility of controlling the interaction between two reactants using membrane. – Reduction of capital cost by combining two units (catalytic reactor and down-stream separation processes) into one. – Easy maintenance of the stoichiometry of the reaction. – The possibility of dividing the reactor and membrane into two individual segments for individual reactions (i.e. oxidative and hydrogenation reactions)."
4,Membrane types,"1.4 Membrane types Membranes are categorized into three main groups including hybrid, organic and inorganic membranes. Organic membranes are classified into polymeric and biological membranes, while inorganic membranes are subdivided into metallic and ceramic (porous and non-porous) ones. Moreover, from porosity viewpoint, membranes are classified into non-porous and porous groups, the latter of which is divided into micro-porous or molecular sieve (pore sizes<2nm), meso-porous (2–50nm) and macro-porous (>50nm) membranes [14]. Hydrogen separation membranes can be categorized into the following classes: polymeric, porous and dense metal membranes such as palladium based membranes (extremely high hydrogen permeable with infinitely selective toward hydrogen) and proton conducting membranes [15]. Porous membranes for hydrogen separation can be divided into meso-porous ceramic membranes and micro-porous ones. For meso-porous ceramic membranes, the main feature is the low selectivity with Knudsen diffusion as its dominant transport mechanism. The separation mechanism for micro-porous ceramic membranes is more complex and is prevailed by selective adsorption and molecular sieving at low and high temperatures respectively, with a complex mix of two processes at intermediate conditions [14,16,17]. Proton conducting membranes as one of hydrogen separation membrane categories, are subdivided into dense ceramic and composite ceramic metal (cermet) membranes. Although dense ceramic membranes are low permeable, they can give an extremely high purity of H2 stream at temperatures as high as 1173K, because of proton transport mechanism. To gain a high hydrogen flux, it is essential to have high values for electronic and protonic conductivities. Perovskite and non-perovskite membranes are two different types of dense ceramic membranes [14,15]. There is no need to an external electrode for perovskite type membranes due to the mixed ionic and electronic conductivity of these materials. However, limited permeability and low thermal and chemical stability are considered as the most common defects of dense ceramic membranes [18]. The overall classification of membranes based on their material and different types of hydrogen separation membranes are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively."
5,Palladium membranes,"Dense metal membranes have potential to transport hydrogen in a dissociative form, and consequently give a theoretically unbounded selectivity [19]. Numerous studies have been done on various metals as candidates for hydrogen permeable membranes. The following trend in decreasing order of hydrogen permeability through various metals is reported in Fig. 4 . Generally, metals such as vanadium, niobium, and tantalum are called refractory metals with an order of magnitude higher permeability in comparison with palladium at lower temperatures. These metals are more inexpensive and possess greater tolerance at high temperatures compared with palladium. Nonetheless, fabrication of these metal membranes (as single components) has been stopped, because in the exposure to hydrogen, they lose flexibility in the presence of 6.9bar hydrogen at room temperature, a process named hydrogen embrittlement. In addition, poor surface properties of the metals (i.e. creation of surface oxide layers), which decreases hydrogen transport, is another factor limiting their use [21–23]. Among these, palladium (Pd) membranes has recently received considerable attention for the following reasons: excellent permeability, high tolerance to hydrocarbon flows and self-catalyzing the H2 dissociation reactions. Another important feature of Pd membrane is its excellent resistance to hydrogen embrittlement and catalytic ability for hydrogen recombination [19,24]. Hydrogen diffusion through Pd lattice is fast due to its capable for hydrogen dissociation into monatomic hydrogen [25]. Also Pd absorbs approximately 600 order of magnitude hydrogen per its volume, while Pd structural integrity as well as its physical properties remain unchanged [26]. Palladium has the atomic number 46 and [Kr]4d10 electron configurations. Pd density and its melting point are 12.023gcm3 and 1828K respectively [25]."
6,Pd-alloy membranes,"2.1 Pd-alloy membranes Although palladium is the best candidate for fabricating hydrogen separation membranes, its use is limited by some major drawbacks; pure Pd is likely to embrittle at temperatures and pressures below 573K and 2MPa, respectively [19,27]. Furthermore, palladium is subjected to deactivation by deposition of carbonaceous impurities (temperatures higher than 723K) and to irreversible sulfur poisoning. High cost of commercial Pd foils (>25μm in thickness) is another limiting factor that affects pure palladium usage [19,28]. As an efficient membrane requires a long lifetime under operating conditions and pure palladium cannot satisfy this requirement, it should be alloyed with other metals, including aluminum, copper, indium, molybdenum, nickel, platinum, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium, silver, titanium and tungsten [19]. Pd alloy with these metals possess a lower critical temperature. Consequently they can operate at lower temperatures without hydrogen embrittlement (embrittlement occurs in pure palladium by repeated hydrogen sorption and desorption cycling). Pd alloys have also indicated higher catalytic activity than pure palladium. Moreover they are resistance to H2S poisoning and thermal cycling. Literature showed that some Pd alloys such as 23% Ag, 6% Ru, 40% Cu, 5% Au are more permeable than pure Pd [29]. In the study of Sakamoto et al. Pd95-x(Y(Gd))x Ag5 with x=6.3 were found to be the most permeable to hydrogen with the permeability of 2–2.5 times higher than Pd-24%Ag [30]. Pd-based membranes technologies are currently developed based on high hydrogen permeability, reasonable thermal stability, and proper mechanical strength [31]."
7,Composite Pd-based membranes,"2.2 Composite Pd-based membranes Hydrogen separation membranes are commonly made of thermally stable inorganic compounds, which can be categorized into two types based on their structures: (1) self-supporting Pd-based membranes, and (2) composite Pd-based membranes (made of a thin selective layer) deposited on porous supports composed of ceramic or stainless steel [32]. The first group gives a very high selectivity for hydrogen, however shows low hydrogen fluxes due to small diffusion coefficients for gases in solids. Moreover, for mechanical stability of these membranes, higher thickness (in the 100μm range) is needed which subsequently results in an expensive noncommercial membrane [32–34]. Although, porous membranes offer less operating cost with high fluxes, they exhibit relatively low hydrogen selectivity [32]. This is due to hydrogen separation is mainly controlled by Knudsen diffusion [34] and hence it is only on the influence of molecular size [35]. Table 1 shows different Pd-alloy composite membrane efficiencies for hydrogen separation. The main development in the membrane technology was production of composite membranes made of a thin metallic film with thickness in the ranges of 1–10μm deposited on porous substrates [32] providing both high flux and mechanical strength of support [19]. Fig. 5 demonstrates hydrogen partial pressure distribution along the structure of the composite membrane (a three layer membrane support) [51]. In the following sections, porous membranes as palladium supports will be discussed and then two major porous supports, (porous ceramic supports and porous metallic supports) will be explained in more details. 2.2.1 Porous supports For porous membranes, the gas transport mechanisms depend on pressure, temperature, pore size to mean free path length ratio and the membrane surfaces [52]. As a result, to describe gas transport behavior, the following diffusion mechanisms are used: Knudsen diffusion (mesopores), surface diffusion (mesopores and micropores), capillary condensation (mesopores), laminar flow or viscous flow (macropores and mesopores) and molecular sieving (macropores and mesopores) [18,53]. The gas transport mechanism in a commercial porous membrane (pore sizes>4nm) at elevated temperatures and low pressures is primarily governed by Knudsen diffusion [34]. When temperature is high, permselectivity increases by reduction of pore sizes and transportation through the membranes can be controlled by pressure with macropores or big mesopores, because under these conditions adsorption is not significant, capillary condensation and surface diffusion do not participate [18]. When membrane pore sizes is much greater than gas molecules, Molecular sieving cannot be accomplished. In this case, the portion of viscous flow, consequence of the difference in pressure across the pores is negligible [34]. 2.2.1.1 Ceramic supports Non-metallic substrates with pore size ranges of 5–200nm are placed in a broad group named, porous ceramic supports. Alumina is commonly used as a ceramic material in the preparation of Pd composite membranes for the following features: reasonable mechanical and thermal stability, widespread usable in different compositions and modifiable by using intermediate layers [54,55]. In general, ceramic supports is divided into a supporting, a middle layer and a top layer. Supporting layer as composition of large ceramic grains exhibits a good mechanical strength with a low resistance to gas transport. The top layer offers a smaller grains to approach a relatively smooth surface. For reduction of gas transport resistance, a sufficiently low thickness of top layer is required. For this purpose, an intermediate layer with middle size grains is employed to join the supporting and top layer [56]. A homogeneous surface features, particles with a diameter less than the top layer thickness and a monotonic pore size distribution are accounted as a proper support characteristics. The underlying support with a relatively surface roughness provides a good mechanical stability without any cracks formation [54]. In the study of Pereira et al. on Pd–Ag based membranes on ceramic supports (α-Al2O3), the gas permeation test indicated that the membrane is selective toward H2. A schematic of their experimental apparatus for hydrogen permeation test is shown in Fig. 6 [57]. 2.2.1.2 Metal supports Porous metal supports have a pore size in the ranges of 0.2–100μm. As the thermal expansion coefficient of these substrates is close to palladium [58], less stress in thermal processes is applied to them. Therefore it is recommended to use them as a support material [59,60]. Non-monotonic pore distribution and non-homogeneous surface of porous metal supports are two obstacles to gain a thin Pd film on the surface [22], which cause defects or pinholes on Pd alloy membrane surfaces. Therefore to have defect-free selective layers, much thicker palladium films is required for porous metal supports in comparison with ceramic supports [21]. Among different porous metal supports, stainless steel is the best candidate for the development of commercial filters, owing to its good weldability, high physical strength and cracking resistance, accessibility, and cost effectiveness [32,61]. Pd–Ag metallic supported membranes for high temperature applications was experimentally investigated by Fernandez et al. The results indicated significantly high permselectivity of H2/N2 at 673–873K [12,57]"
8,Preparation methods for composite membranes,"Numerous studies have been devoted to alternative methods of Pd and Pd-alloy deposition on different materials. Film porosity, grain size and adhesion controlled by film deposition methods, can effect on hydrogen permeability, membrane life time and permselectivity [22]. A variety of techniques such as electroless plating (ELP) [62], physical vapor deposition (PVD) [15], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [41], pyrolysis [34], micro-emulsion technique, pore plugging by liquid impregnation [8], electroplating [16], solvated metal atom deposition and high velocity oxy-fuel spraying (HVOF) [22] are available for Pd deposition. The main methods to date which have produced satisfactorily composite membranes include electroless plating, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and PVD magnetron sputtering [8] which would be explained specifically in the following sections."
9,Electroless plating (ELP),"3.1 Electroless plating (ELP) Electroless plating (ELP) is a heterogeneous oxidation-reduction reaction (known as autocatalytic deposition process) [62], involving metal deposition at the solid-liquid interface without using electrical energy [63]. ELP reduces metallic salt complexes on a support material surface [27]. An activation step is provided by seeding the surface with metal crystallites to initiate plating and to warrant the adherence of the film. The electroless plating is initiated by metal nucleation sites through accelerating of reducing agent decomposition in the plating bath [22]. Conventional electroless plating consists of: (a) seeding a support surface with Pd fine particles via sensitization [64] (e.g. with stannous chloride [34]) and activation [64] (e.g., with palladium chloride [34]), and (b) Pd layer plating on top of the activated surface. The initial rough surface of support can be smoothed by the deposition of intermediate layers (Fig. 7 ) [64]. Successful electroless plating cannot be simply attained by adding a reducing agent to metal ion solution. In practice, the pH of the solution alters during plating and thus will affect the rate of deposition. Hence, a buffer needs to be added in the plating bath to stabilize the pH of solution. The temperature of plating bath is also an important operating parameter that can extremely affect the rate of deposition [62]. Pd alloys synthesis by this method leads to disparate reduction potential of the metallic ions and subsequent of uneven deposition. This occurs for Pd-Ag alloys where dendritic growth is observed. However this challenge can be prevailed by adjusting reactant concentrations [65]. An interesting adjunct to the electroless plating method is the plating with osmosis. Essentially this method involves electroless plating on the outside surface of the membrane, by simultaneous circulating of a high osmotic pressure solution through the tube-side of the membrane. By osmotic pressure, the water in the plating solution permeates into the high osmotic pressure solution. This increases the concentration of Pd complexes in the substrate pores, leading to denser films of Pd. This has been shown to be capable of repairing pinholes in the Pd layer, which may appear after the first electroplating deposition [66]. 3.1.1 Advantages and disadvantages of electroless plating Electroless plating is rather low cost due to the simple equipment required and the absence of electrical source. It also supplies monotonic dense coatings on both conducting and non-conducting surfaces. Moreover, it has the ability of covering supports with complex geometries [15,16]. Also, this method performs the co-deposition of Pd and Ag through simple preparation processes. Hence, the alloying can be conducted at low temperature during annealing process [67]. ELP is more complicated and takes more time because there are several pre-treatment stages such as activation and sensitization before accomplishment of final plating of the desired metal [65]. Using of extremely poisonous chemicals and formation of hazardous liquid wastes are another drawbacks of ELP [22]."
10,Chemical vapor deposition (CVD),"3.2 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), is a process using thermal decomposition of one or several volatile precursors to create thin films on a substrate [68]. The chemical reaction is an essential characteristic of the method. Within obtaining composite metal membrane, the organometallic substance is generally sublimed in a separate vessel, swept using an inert gas and reacted with a gas such as hydrogen or thermally decomposed on the desired surface [69]. The MOCVD process can be affected by the following parameters: substrate quality (defects) and temperature, precursor quality, hydrogen content in the deposition atmosphere, precursor amount loaded in the MOCVD reactor and sublimation temperature [70]. 3.2.1 Advantages and disadvantages of chemical vapor deposition Adjusting the film thickness (generally>3μm) and providing high film quality and reasonable adhesion on the membrane substrate are some particular challenges in electroless plating. Therefore, there is a considerable interest focused on advancement of dense supported Pd membranes by vapor phase processes, such as CVD [41]. In spite of CVD technique can be applied to fabricate thin films, it requires costly Pd precursors (i.e., Pd(C3H5)2, Pd(C3H5)(C5H5) and Pd(C5H5)2) of good thermal stability and high volatility. In addition, high purity constituents and high-vacuum (<0.1mmHg) conditions are required in this method [71]. Another drawback of the method is that CVD tends to give lower fluxes and also produces smaller values of the H2/N2 selectivity in comparison with electroless plating [8], and also the film may be polluted with organometallic elements such as carbon [41]."
11,Physical vapor deposition (PVD),"3.3 Physical vapor deposition (PVD) PVD stands for physical vapor deposition as a coating method. In this technique, the solid source is vaporized by gaseous plasma or a high temperature vacuum. Then the target atoms are bombarded with energetic particles to coat the entire substrates with thin films through condensation [34,72]. PVD and CVD are the same techniques except that in PVD the precursors are generally in the elemental state (as a pure metal), so chemical decomposition reactions do not occur in the surface while in CVD, the precursors are in the vaporized state (as a chemical compounds) [70]. Representative techniques in PVD are thermal evaporation, pulsed laser evaporation, magnetron sputtering and also sputtering with an electron beam, laser or ion gun [8,15,70,73,74]. Pereira et al. employed MS (magnetron sputtering) as a type of PVD method for the Pd-Ag thin film membrane synthesis. In this technique Pd and Ag targets are bombarding with energetic argon particles and then neutral metal atom species are repulsed, which consequently condense on the support. The support is heated and rotated between both inclined magnetrons during the process (see Fig. 8 ) [57]. 3.3.1 Advantages and disadvantages of physical vapor deposition PVD is superior to ELP, because of its environmentally friendly nature, no liquid waste from chemical baths is produced [75]. Although PVD are implemented to coat thin, uniform metal and metal alloy films, it is unable to easily coat the interior part of tubes [22,76], and thus this method can be applied only for supports with a flat substrate geometry. This shortcoming severely limits the range of practical applications [27]. Also, it suffers from low efficiency and high cost due to the expensive high vacuum equipment required [16]."
12,The effect of various parameters on permeation rate,"Mass transfer in Pd membranes is a complicated process, can be affected by many factors. In order to verify the behavior of palladium membranes under different conditions, it is essential to demonstrate the effect of various parameters on these membranes. Some of the key factors such as operating conditions, thickness of the membrane, direction of the permeation and air pre-treatment will be discussed in the following sections. In addition, the effect of gases presented in the feed mixture on permeation rate and the mechanisms will be covered in more details."
13,Operating conditions,"4.1 Operating conditions Wei et al. showed that in the absence of chemical reactions, pressure is likely to increase hydrogen flux and decrease its selectivity, while augmentation of temperature leads to an increase in both hydrogen flux and selectivity. However, from the durability point of view, too high temperatures can shorten the membrane life [61,75]. Yolcular also observed the same result for Pd/TiO2 composite membranes [31]. The results of Wei et al. experiments are shown in Fig. 9 (a and b). The influence of sweep gas on hydrogen permeation was verified by Li et al. [51] and Didenko et al. [77]. Sweep gas reduces the hydrogen partial pressure on the permeation side by dilution, which causes increasing of Н2 transport rate. Although sweep gas improves the membrane performance, additional cost associated with its operation must be justifiable. Minimum sweep gas flow rate should be capable to enhance at least 10% augmentation in average H2 flux with reasonable operational cost [51]."
14,Thickness of the membrane,"4.2 Thickness of the membrane Generally, to obtain high hydrogen separation flux, the Pd membranes are desired to be as thin as possible to speed up the diffusion step [61]. However the thin membrane thickness should guarantee a reasonable sufficient mechanical strength to be self-standing [31]. However, the preparation of a thin defect free Pd membrane is still a concern. Many investigations have been devoted to find more efficient ways of membrane preparation. As previously mentioned, it is beneficial to apply a substrate as a mechanical support with the ultimate goal of producing a thin film of Pd with sufficient mechanical strength [22,32]. It is necessary to mention that the surface roughness of the support must be reasonably small. Hence, ceramic supports with smaller surface roughness in comparison to porous metal supports are advisable to be applied [21,22]. In addition, CVD and PVD techniques are among preparation methods with the highest capability of producing a thin Pd based membrane [22,41]. Moreover, a thin layer coating of Pd provide an unreactive surface and as an efficient catalyst dissociates hydrogen into the atomic form [22]."
15,Direction of hydrogen permeation,"4.3 Direction of hydrogen permeation Goto et al. surveyed the effect of hydrogen diffusion direction on permeation rate of a composite palladium membrane under two ways, namely ‘CP mode’ and ‘PC mode’. In the ‘CP mode’, hydrogen direction is from the ceramic support to the palladium film, while in the ‘PC mode’ hydrogen direction is in the reverse way. The results demonstrated higher permeability rate for the CP mode [78]. Liang and Hughes showed that hydrogen permeation direction is strongly as a function of feedstock. Higher permeability rate for pure hydrogen is from the support to metal film, while a hydrogen/nitrogen mixture, the opposite results was achieved [79]"
16,Air pre-treatment,4.4 Air pre-treatment The influence of air pre-treatment on the membrane performance was investigated experimentally. It was found that the oxygen pre-treatment activates the Pd-Ag surface and eliminate carbonaceous surface impurity by oxidation reactions which can directly affect hydrogen permeability [56].
17,The effect of various impurities,"4.5 The effect of various impurities In this section, the effect of various impurities on the performance of palladium membranes will be explained in details. H2S as highly corrosive gas can react with pure Pd to form a thick Pd4S film on the Pd surface by the following reaction: (1) 4 P d + H 2 S ↔ P d 4 S + H 2 Although hydrogen can be decomposed by Pd4S surface, it severely retards hydrogen permeation [16,80] and also reduces the mechanical strength of the membrane [81]. Another mechanism regarding H2S presence is the adsorption of its molecules on the surface of palladium. For steam reforming of methane or methanol the fractional surface coverage of H2S depends on the ratio PH2S/PH2. So the removal of produced hydrogen will be in favor of the H2S adsorption, and thus affect the catalytic activity of palladium. For this case the effect of low amounts of H2S can be minimized at a higher temperature or using a platinum protective layer [8]. For the Pd-alloy membranes, although H2S reduces the hydrogen flux, the mechanism is completely different. For example, the Pd47Cu53 alloy creates an extremely thin Pd-Cu-S layer which is impermeable to hydrogen [16], but its impermeability is lower than that of pure Pd owing to lower H2S binding tendency of Cu than Pd [82]. In order to investigate the capability of Pd alloys in controlling the effect of H2S on permeability, O’Brien and Howard designed an experiment with PdCu other than pure Pd. The results indicated that PdCu membrane loses its permeability towards hydrogen within about 5min, while pure Pd is still active for six hours [81]. For N2 mixtures, Pizzi et al. recognized that the absolute value of H2 permeance is certainly lower with respect to pure H2 permeation [56]. This is mainly because of the dilution of the feed mixture that further results in lower driving force exerted on the system [83]. Hence, purifying the feed mixture from inert component of nitrogen can greatly improve the efficiency of palladium membranes. Carbon monoxide blockage includes two main mechanisms: (1) CO molecules are adsorbed at the same sites of metal surface for hydrogen atoms, consequently H2 adsorption would be directly blocked [83,84]. In this case, even a small amount of CO can affects the hydrogen permeability [85,86]. (2) CO adsorbed on the membrane surface influence on transition state energy of hydrogen dissociation [83]. The adsorbed CO can then decompose to carbon atoms which can diffuse through Pd to produce palladium carbide [87]. When Pd is heated in the presence of oxygen or air in temperature ranges of 673–1123K, a dense PdO film is created. In this case, increasing temperature can cause an increase in PdO layer thickness which results in even lower permeation rate [35]. Also, water formation in the presence of oxygen coverage for adsorbed hydrogen is possible which subsequently reduces hydrogen permeation rate caused by small hydrogen coverage [86]. The effects of individual components of CO and O2 have been discussed above. However, the co-adsorption of both molecules has not been considered. In this situation, carbon dioxide formation reaction in the presence of CO is replaced with water formation reaction. Based on the ratio of CO/O2 and the temperature, the blocking caused by CO+O2 can be either higher or lower than that caused by pure O2 [86]. According to Gielens et al. [87] a considerable decrease in hydrogen flux is expected in the presence of steam. This is due to a competitive adsorption would be arises between water and hydrogen molecules which leads to decreasing the number of active sites and further reduction of H2 flux [87,88]. However, this phenomenon is reversible. Moreover, it was shown that hydrogen fluxes in the mixtures of H2/H2O is lower than H2/N2 mixtures at the same operating conditions [87–90]."
18,Sieverts’ law,"Hydrogen permeation through Pd membranes is described by a solution-diffusion mechanism. Hydrogen diffusion from a high to a low pressure zone occurs in the following steps (Fig. 10 ) [24,91,92]: – Transferring of H2 molecules to metallic membrane surface – Reversible H2 chemisorption on the metal surface – Reversible atomic hydrogen dissolution at the membrane surface – Atomic hydrogen diffusion within metal lattice (generally rate limiting step) – Atomic hydrogen association at the metal surface – Hydrogen molecular desorption from the surface of metal – Transferring of H2 molecules from the membrane surface If atomic hydrogen diffusion through the metal lattice is the rate controlling step, and H/Pd <1, Sieverts’ law would be applied [93]. This law which is only valid at low pressure hydrogen, thick membranes and moderate temperatures is given in following equation [94]: (2) J H 2 = π H 2 ⌊ ( P F e e d H 2 ) 0.5 − ( P H 2 P e r m e a t e ) 0.5 ⌋ Where JH2 is the hydrogen flux through the membrane, πH2 is the proportionality factor and P is the hydrogen partial pressure either on the retentate side or on the permeate side [6]. In the above equation πH2 can be evaluated from Arrhenius law, which is bounded to high temperatures [94], and can be described as below [61]: (3) π H 2 = π ( 0 ) H 2 exp ( − E a / R T ) Where π H w ( 0 ) , EA, R and T represent the pre-exponential factor, the apparent activation energy, the universal gas constant and the absolute temperature respectively. For estimation of hydrogen flux even for the case when hydrogen diffusion within metal lattice is not the only rate-limiting step, the following modification is suggested [93]: (4) J H 2 = π ( n ) H 2 ⌊ ( P H 2 F e e d ) n − ( P H 2 P e r m e a t e ) n ⌋ Where n is an empirical exponent, which can be obtained by a nonlinear regression. This parameter has its own physical meaning that represents the rate determining step in the permeation process of hydrogen through Pd-based membranes. Pure H2 flux in Fig. 11 proves the validity of Sieverts’ law, which means that diffusion of hydrogen atoms through Pd-Ag membrane is the rate limiting step. However, in the presence of N2, hydrogen flux confirms Sieverts’ law only at low pressures and deviates at high pressures [56]."
19,Damkohler-Peclet product design parameter,"There are two main factors affecting the performance of plug flow reactor (PFR): reaction rate and the rate of the reactants fed per catalyst volume. Their ratio gives the so-called Damkohler number (Da) [95]: (5) D a = ( r e a c t o r v o l u m e ) × ( m a x i m u m r e a c t i o n r a t e p e r u n i t v o l u m e ) ( i n l e t f l o w r a t e ) For membrane reactor, another rate (the permeation rate of the fast gas) is also added, which can be termed as the Damkohler-Peclet product: (6) D a × P e = ( m a x i m u m r e a c t i o n r a t e p e r u n i t v o l u m e ) ( m a x i m u m p e r m e a t i o n r a t e p e r u n i t v o l u m e ) It is explained that if the permeation rate is too low (i.e., the product Da×Pe is very high), the membrane efficiency is low and the reactor performs like a PFR with the feed gas as reactant. On the other hand, if the permeation rate is too high (i.e., the product Da×Pe is very low), the shell and tube sides will equilibrate rapidly [96], and no driving force results for permeation. In practice, the latter is unlikely to occur with selective membranes such as Pd-Ag because of the dense non-porous nature of the deposited layer. It has been noted that for optimum performance of a membrane reactor, the product Da×Pe should lie between 0.1 and 10 [8]. The effect of catalyst activity as an important factor is reflected in the Da value. In the low reaction rates, equilibrium is not achieved and product removal by the membrane will not change the ultimate reaction yield. In other words, slower reactions are not helped by membrane reactor as they are kinetically limited (lowDa) [96]. The Damkohler-Peclet product can be used as a design parameter. In order to change Da×Pe, without simultaneously changing Da, the membrane area can be changed while holding the reactor volume constant. Thus to increase the Da×Pe, the membrane area must be decreased. Alternatively, to decrease Da×Pe, the membrane area per reactor unit volume must be increased. To achieve the latter, the use of multi-tubular membrane systems is appropriate, while for the former the use of single tube membranes with catalyst in the annular space is more suitable [8]."
20,Membrane reactor configurations and process classification,"Integration of reaction and separation processes in one unit is able to cope several problems arising in chemical reaction engineering, [95] however the operating conditions of membrane reactors are relatively complicated due to combination of chemical reactions with membrane permeation process [96]. The membrane reactors can be categorized into two basic categories according to the catalytic behavior of membrane. Membranes can be inert or they can act as the reaction catalyst (they can be either inherently catalyst or impregnated by catalyst). The former is called inert membrane reactor (IMR) and the latter is named catalytic membrane reactor (CMR). Both IMRs and CMRs can be either packed with catalyst or the catalyst can be fluidized in the tube side. This results in different membrane reactor configurations including inert membrane packed bed reactor (IMPBR), inert membrane fluidized bed reactor (IMFBR), packed bed catalytic membrane reactor (PBCMR), and fluidized bed catalytic membrane reactor (FBCMR) [18,34,67]. The abovementioned reactors are used in a variety of membrane geometries. Currently planar and tubular membranes are commonly used for gas separation process. In research and development, planar membranes are frequently used, while tubular membranes are the most preferred choice for industrial applications because of their high surface area-to-volume ratio [15]. In the last decade, researchers have focused on reactors including H2 permselective palladium membranes [2,6,9,23,97–105], polymeric catalytic membranes [106], auto-thermal membranes [107], zeolite membranes [108], ceramic membranes [109,110], carbon membranes [111,112], inert membranes [112], and dense membranes [41]. Fixed bed, packed bed, fluidized bed and slurry membrane reactors are four major types of hydrogenation reactors, which will be discussed in the following sections."
21,Fixed bed membrane reactors,"7.1 Fixed bed membrane reactors Currently chemical process researches are concentrated on the conducting hydrogenation or dehydrogenation reactions in the membrane reactors which fixed bed membrane reactor (FMR) is the simplest one among them. This type of membrane reactor, two main operations are simultaneously performed: the reactions are shifted toward the desired products and one or more reactant(s) or product(s) are removed from the reaction side [35]. Fixed bed membrane reactors are considered as units consisting of large cylinders as well as jacketed or shell and tube reactors in which a membrane or a hollow tube is located. The reactions take place on the catalyst surface packed in the annulus [113]. Finding a proper configuration for augmentation of desired products has been studied widely. The enhancement of operating condition for hydrogen separation from the reaction mixture was always the main concerns of the researchers. Several types of reactor with various modes of operation (i.e., lower pressure drop configurations, coupled reactors, etc.) have been recommended. Before investing in development of a pilot plant stage, complicated mathematical models are used essentially to describe the basic parameters of such novel configurations. In addition in order to save time and money, successful commercialization of such novel configurations will be achieved through exploration of pilot plant optimal conditions by model development. Based on feedstock flow pattern and the reactor structure, fixed bed reactors are categorized as below: – Axial-flow, tubular reactor – Radial-flow, tubular reactor – Axial-flow, spherical reactor 7.1.1 Axial-flow, tubular membrane reactor Fig. 12 shows an axial-flow, tubular membrane reactor configuration for simultaneous dimethyl ether (DME) and benzene synthesis. This system has three concentric tubes in which DME synthesis and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane occur in the inner (first) and outer (second) tubes respectively. A hydrogen permselective membrane is located as the wall between second and third tubes to remove hydrogen from the second one. Sweeping gas flowing through permeation side transmits the permeated hydrogen. A palladium-silver alloy with the thickness of 6mm deposited on a thermo stable support is employed. Hydrogen flux permeated through membrane obeys half-power pressure law (Sievert’s law). Hydrogen recovery yield as well as cyclohexane conversion were obtained 2.86 and 99.9% respectively. The results indicate the feasibility of thermally coupled membrane reactor for both DME and hydrogen production [114]. Thermally coupled reactors are multifunctional reactors in which exothermic reaction, as a heat source, provides the required heat of endothermic one in a single vessel. Synthesis of multiple products, improvement of productivity, decreasing the reactor size and beating the thermodynamic limitation of the reactions are all the advantages with coupling reactors [115]. However, experimental studies under common operating conditions are required to prove the accuracy of the model used to describe these configurations. There are several studies in the literature focused on axial-flow, membrane reactors [116–125]. Fig. 13 shows a membrane dual-type reactor configuration for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS). The first reactor is called water-cooled reactor and the second one is referred as the gas-cooled reactor. Synthesis gas is first preheated in tube side of the second reactor and then enters the first reactor to convert partially into hydrocarbons. The outlet gas of the first reactor is sent to shell side of the second one to complete the reactions. In order to gain relatively high conversion of synthesis gas to light hydrocarbon, a Pd membrane coated the wall of the tubes of the second reactor is used to permeate hydrogen from the reaction side since there is difference in hydrogen partial pressure. In extremely high exothermic reactions such as FTS, a temperature jump may occur in the first part of reactor. Membrane dual-type reactors are more able to control temperature compared to conventional one. This is due to the inlet feed in the second reactor has lower hydrogen, because of hydrogen permeation through the membrane. As a result, heat of reaction will reduce and a lower temperature peak with a better products distribution will be achieved. In this membrane reactor, C5+ selectivity increases and undesired products (i.e., methane and carbon dioxide) are reduced. The results also indicated higher hydrogen permeation rate in counter-current mode of operation compared to co-current one [126]. Rahimpour et al. [127] considered a conventional two-stage methanol synthesis reactor using a hydrogen-permselective membrane. Syngas partially converts to methanol in the first reactor while in the second one the reaction heat is used to preheat the feedstock of the first reactor. A Pd–Ag membrane was employed in the wall of the tubes of the second reactor in order to improve the overall CO conversion to methanol. Rahimpour and Bayat [128] considered a cascade membrane methanol reactor in the presence of catalyst deactivation. The wall of tubes in the both reactors were coated with Pd-Ag membrane. The results showed 4.7% increasing methanol production yield during 1400days of operation in this configuration compared to conventional dual type methanol reactor. 7.1.2 Radial-flow, tubular membrane reactor Radial-flow, reactors have the advantage of low pressure drop across the bed and high reaction yield. The design of radial-flow, tubular membrane naphtha reactor is shown in Fig. 14 . In this configuration, for a uniform flow distribution the naphtha feed and sweep gas predominately flows radially in tube and shell sides. There is a collector pipe consisted of two concentric cylinders. The inner tube is used to collect the sweeping gas while the outer tube collects the final products. The cross-section area of this configurations is divided into some subsections. Pd–Ag membrane layer used as the walls of the gaps between these subsections, permeates hydrogen from the reaction side. Permeated hydrogen in the shell side is carried by the sweeping gas. Sweep gas pressure, membrane thickness, length to diameter ratio, the ratio of permeation angle to the reaction angle, etc. were chosen as decision variables to increase aromatic and hydrogen yields. In optimized conditions, hydrogen and aromatic yields were enhanced 11.60% and 8.90% respectively. Although reaction yields significantly increase in this reactor, the cost evaluation needs to be verified [129]. Iranshahi et al. [130] studied an optimized radial-flow moving bed membrane reactor for catalytic naphtha reforming process. Insertion of hydrogen permselective membrane in this configuration in the optimal conditions, increases aromatics and hydrogen production rates, and reduces light end products respect to the conventional process. Farsi et al. [131] proposed radial flow moving bed hydrogen-permselective membrane reactors for isobutene production. Compared to conventional configuration, isobutene production rate was enhanced about 3.7%. 7.1.3 Axial-flow, spherical membrane reactor The advantages of this configuration in comparison with tubular reactors are significantly lower pressure drop, lower manufacturing costs owing to small wall thickness, higher production capacity and lower recompression cost [132,133]. Implementation of a membrane layer for hydrogen removal was investigated in spherical reactors. A spherical membrane reactor (SMR) for naphtha reforming process is illustrated in Fig. 15 . There are two concentric spheres in SMR configuration. The inner sphere is covered with a Pd-Ag membrane layer. Feed and sweeping gas enters axially through the inner and outer sphere respectively. Hydrogen produced during the reaction permeates to shell side and then is carried by the sweeping gas. Based on Le Chatelier’s principle, the equilibrium is shifted toward the desired products, hence, higher products’ yields will be achieve in this configuration compared to conventional one [134]. Iranshahi et al. [135] proposed a combination of tubular membrane and spherical reactors for conventional naphtha reforming process. The results indicated a remarkable increase in aromatic (8.01%) and hydrogen (9.81%) production rates in this optimized configuration."
22,Packed bed membrane reactors,"7.2 Packed bed membrane reactors Numerous studies have been carried out on palladium based permselective membranes along with a packed bed of catalyst [6]. The most common configuration of packed bed is tubular. Catalysts can be packed either in tube (Fig. 16 (a)) or in the shell side (Fig. 16(b)), whilst the sweep gas flows on the other side of the packed catalysts [136]. Fig. 16: Packed bed membrane reactor with catalyst packed (a) in the tube and (b) in the shell side [136]. The transport process through packed bed membrane reactors is because of considerable difference in partial pressures of hydrogen between the reaction and permeation sides [6], resulting in less membrane surface area required for hydrogen separation [15]. The mass transfer driving force is caused by two factors: use of vacuum or sweep gas [6,22,34]. Vacuum industrial applications would be too costly, and although using a sweep gas requires a further separation step, it is of great interest among researchers [137]. The sweep gases can be either reactive (e.g. carbon monoxide, air or oxygen) or inert (e.g. N2, steam or helium), based on their chemical nature with respect to the reaction [6,8,138]. Among these, steam has the superiority of being available on-site and can be easily separated from the permeated hydrogen. Use of air or oxygen as a reactive sweep gas produces water as a product on the permeation side, and although it may facilitate the permeation of hydrogen, it produces a byproduct of little value [8]. Along with advantages that this type of membrane reactor possesses, there are also some disadvantages that must be considered. One defect of hydrogen permeation through the membrane is the bed-to-wall mass transfer limitations (a phenomenon called concentration polarization), which is possible in packed bed membrane reactors (PBMRs), as it specifies the membrane area needed for a certain hydrogen recovery. Lower selective layer thickness increases transmembrane flux (due to reduction of resistance), however the external mass transfer would be one of the slowest elementary steps, subsequently concentration polarization occurs. Concentration polarization phenomena can severely influence the membrane performance in a way that the Sieverts’ law cannot be applied for prediction of hydrogen permeation. For that reason, a systematic approach is needed to find the polarization level for accurate design of membrane equipment [139]. Caravella et al. [139] showed that the concentration polarization is reduced with membrane thickness, upstream hydrogen mole fraction, turbulence and downstream total pressure, while augments with upstream total pressure and temperature. Nakajima et al. indicated that increasing feedstock gas linear velocity and decreasing the reactor diameter vessel makes the flow boundary layer on the membrane thin, which subsequently reduces the concentration polarization [140]. The second important drawback of PBMRs is the pressure drop along the reactor, which bounds the size of catalyst particle to be used. To decrease the pressure drop, particles with large sizes are required, but this hinders the intra-particle mass transfer, which is manifested as increased membrane area needed for a certain conversion/recovery [15]. Temperature control is another limiting factor in association with PBMR. Reduction of temperature on the membrane surface results in a lower hydrogen flux through the membrane [61,75], while temperature increasing leads to membrane surface cracking and subsequently reduction of permselectivity [15]. In order to overcome deterioration and detachment of the Pd-based layer from the support, the membrane material must sustain a large axial temperature gradient [141]. PBMRs also possess some disadvantages including radial concentration and temperature gradients, difficulties in the removal of reaction heat, low specific surface area of the membrane and inflexibility with respect to the arrangement of membranes and cooling tubes [75]."
23,Fluidized bed membrane reactors,"7.3 Fluidized bed membrane reactors Another kind of membrane reactor for hydrogenation is fluidized bed membrane reactor (FBMR), in which a bundle of hydrogen-selective membranes is placed in a catalytic bed, operating in the turbulent, bubbling or fast fluidization regime (Fig. 17 ). However, most of the experimental work on FBMR were conducted in the bubbling flow regime [15,108–113,136,137,139,141–146]. The application of vertical tubes in bubbling fluidized bed is more common in comparison with horizontal tubes due to its considerable impact on the bed hydrodynamics, ease of construction and its wear-decreasing impact. However more selective removal of product can be achieved in the horizontal arrangement of membranes [8,75]. FBMRs have the merit of isothermal conditions along the tube due to the movement of catalyst particles [8,118,145]. This possibility of isothermal operation avoids strain on the membrane, produces uniform permeation rates [8], and allows the reactor to operate autothermal reforming (ATR) of hydrocarbons. Methane autothermal reforming in a packed bed membrane reactor is actually difficult because of hot-spots creation at the reactor inlet which may result in melting the membrane. This problem often occurs in fluidized bed assisted membrane reactor [145]. In these types of reactor, bubble-to-emulsion phase mass transfer is considered as an important mass transfer limitation which affects the reactor performance. As the mass transfer coefficient between emulsion and bubble phases decrease, a larger gas slip via the bubble phase as well as less conversion would be achieved. As a matter of fact increasing the reactor length can increase bubble diameter, which results in an increase in bubble-to-emulsion phase mass transfer limitation and consequently a decrease in the reactant conversion. A method to overcome this problem is reduction of the bubble diameter by inserting stagers at different reactor heights (i.e., staging the fluidized bed reactor) [141]. Great tube-to-bed heat transfer in FBMRs provides a safe operation even for extremely high exothermic reactions [75]. FBMR offers the advantages of both membrane and fluidized bed reactor, including isothermal operation, negligible pressure drop, flexible arrangement of membrane package, improved fluidization behavior owing to compartmentalization, reduction of average bubble size, small internal spacing, and optimal concentration profiles due to controlled dosing or withdrawal. On the other hand, FBMRs suffer from disadvantages including the erosion of reactor internals and catalyst attrition due to vigorous particle motion created by gas bubbles in the bed and difficulties in reactor construction and membrane sealing at wall [75,146–151]. A fluidized-bed membrane reactor for production of methanol and hydrogen is depicted schematically in Fig. 18 . This configuration consists of three concentric tubes. Methanol synthesis occurs in the inner one as a fluidized-bed reactor and also as a heat source of the endothermic side. Cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene is carried out in the second tube coated by a Pd-Ag membrane layer. Hydrogen produced by dehydrogenation of cyclohexane diffuses into the permeation side (outer tube). The performance of this configuration was also compared with thermally coupled membrane reactor at the same operating conditions. The results demonstrate that the hydrogen recovery yield and benzene production of FBMR increases about 5.6% and 8.52% relative to that of thermally coupled membrane reactor. This is because of low pressure drop and negligible mass and heat transfer limitations in fluidization processes. The results demonstrate the advantages and the feasibility of this novel configuration for pure hydrogen production [1]. Fig. 19 demonstrates a cascading fluidized-bed membrane methanol reactor (CFBMMR) configuration. Both reactors are fluidized-bed using small catalyst size. The outlet gas from the first reactor (water cooled) is sent to the bottom of the second one (gas-cooled reactor) to fluidize the catalyst bed. Also the synthesis gas leaving the second reactor enters the bottom of the first reactor. A hydrogen permselective membrane is used in the second reactor as the walls of tubes. The performance of CFBMMR was compared with an industrial dual-type methanol reactor and the results showed 9.53% in methanol production yield in the proposed configuration. [152]. Rahimpour et al. [153] and Bayat and Rahimpour [154] simulated a cascade fluidized-bed membrane reactor for FTS and methanol synthesis respectively."
24,Slurry bubble column membrane reactor,"7.4 Slurry bubble column membrane reactor The slurry bubble column membrane reactor suggested here consists of a water-cooled (a fixed-bed reactor) and gas-cooled reactor (slurry bubble column reactor). In a gas-cooled reactor, an inert liquid is used to absorb and transfer heat of reaction. Dispersed catalyst particles flow upward through the liquid phase. A schematic of this configuration is presented in Fig. 20 . The tubes wall of slurry bubble column reactor is coated with a Pd membrane to add hydrogen to the reaction side in order to gain a higher conversion of synthesis gas. This configuration is an appropriate reactor type for high temperature process relative to conventional and membrane FTS reactors [155]. The work presented is still theoretical in nature but does show some potential for application. Practical design, implementation and fabrication of such a reactor will present a range of challenges which a developer will need to recognize and acknowledge."
25,Classification of alternative reactions for hydrogen production using Pd-based membranes,"There are a great number of reactions to generate hydrogen in membrane reactors including water gas shift, autothermal reforming, steam reforming, partial oxidation and dehydrogenation reactions. Lack of adequate research on various aspects of these chemical reactions and their influence on permeation parameters necessitates more attention. In the following sections, some aspects of the two main hydrogen production reactions will be discussed."
26,Water-gas shift process (WGS),"8.1 Water-gas shift process (WGS) Water gas shift (WGS) reaction occurs in some industrial processes, such as catalytic steam reforming of hydrocarbons, coal gasification, and production of ammonia. In accordance with Eq. 7, WGS is an exothermic reaction with no change in the number of moles. The forward reaction is favored in low temperatures and is not affected by the pressure changes. But in Pd-based MR, operating in high pressure leads to increasing of hydrogen permeation rate and since the reaction is shifted towards products formation, the bed temperature would be reduced. Moreover, the amount of required catalyst for a certain conversion decreases and the blocking effect of the Pd membrane surface sites at T<623K is reduced [23,53,156–158]. (7) C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 Δ H 298 k = − 41.1 k j . m o l − 1 Higher feed space velocities which provide a lower residence time, negatively affect CO conversion as well as H2 permeation through the Pd membrane. For more permeation through membrane, a sweep gas is often applied. However additional separation stage downstream would be required [157,159,160]. In water gas shift membrane reactor (WGSMR), the co-current mode of operation reduces the thermal effects in membrane reactor through declining temperature rise in the reaction side. This occurs as a results of heat transferring with the permeation side as a cooling medium of the reactor. In the countercurrent scheme, the reaction ignition is facilitated because of preheating effect of permeated stream, however a high temperature rise may occurs in reactor bed which is a source of instability [159]. In Fig. 21 , production and purification of hydrogen based on WGSMR is shown [161]. Hydrogen is produced via steam reforming, partial oxidation, and autothermal reforming of fossil fuels (including natural gas, naphtha and light oil) and alcohols with a high level of energy conversion [162]. Among these, the steam reforming of hydrocarbons, which supplies the half of hydrogen produced in the world, requires more attention. In steam reforming of methane following reactions occurs [138]: (8) C O 4 + H 2 O ⇔ C O + 3 H 2 Δ H ∘ 298 k = 206 k j . m o l − 1 (9) C O + H 2 O ⇔ C O 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H ∘ 298 k = − 41 k j . m o l − 1 These reactions are highly endothermic equilibrium limited. Therefore for higher methane conversion, the process is required to perform at high temperatures, which means high energy consumption and a costly external high temperature heat exchange equipment [8,138,163]. Practitioners and researchers have shown that fabrication of metal membrane reformer for both hydrogen separation and production in only one unit particularly in steam reforming process must be considered as an imperative task for highly pure hydrogen generation [164–168]. Steam reforming of methane (SRM) is considered as the most important chemical process for hydrogen production and it can operate with stability even at low hydrogen partial pressure [8,22,138,141,169,170]. In the steam reforming of heavier hydrocarbons such as liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, and kerosene, the performance of membrane reformer may decline due to carbon deposition on the catalyst and/or palladium membrane [171]. Traditional SRM process includes of several steps such as primary and secondary reformers, feed gas preheating and pretreatment, high and low temperature shift converters, CO2 removal and methanation units. Also a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit is required to gain a high hydrogen purity [88,171]. By combination of hydrogen perm-selective membranes and steam reformer, the number of process units as well as the total reactor volume are decreased. Moreover under conditions of low temperatures, a higher hydrogen yields and methane conversions would be achieved [141,172]. In addition in order to change the operating temperature is offered for shifting WGS reaction towards CO2 and H2 production, hydrogen removal from the reaction side also facilities the equilibrium shifting of the reaction [87,138]. As can be seen in Fig. 22 the membrane reactor can integrate these steps in only one reactor [2]. In autothermal reforming process, methane is partially oxidized in the presence of air or pure oxygen to provide the required reaction energy for in situ steam reforming [151,164]. The possibility of performing of methane ATR in packed bed membrane reactors in isothermal and adiabatic mode of operation was investigated. The energy consumption by the reforming reaction in isothermal operation may be balanced by heat generated during combustion and water gas shift reactions, while in adiabatic operation, incredible high temperature gradients appear [151]. Fig. 23 shows a membrane reactor for autothermal methane reforming [173]."
27,Dehydrogenation process,"8.2 Dehydrogenation process Selective unsaturated alcohols dehydrogenation is the main process in the production of fine chemicals (i.e., unsaturated aldehydes in the synthesis of fragrances and pharmaceuticals). Selective dehydrogenation of hydroxyl groups in the presence of hydroxyl groups and carbon-carbon double bonds as reactive chemical structures bonds in unsaturated alcohols is too difficult because it leads to hydrogenation of both hydroxyl groups and carbon-carbon double bonds [174]. Hydrogen perm-selective membrane reactors such as Pd membrane reactors are interesting candidates for applications in dehydrogenation reactions, because the reaction shifts in favor of hydrogen production, which is withdrawn from the reaction side to permeation side [6,175–181]. Palladium membrane reactors have the capability to promote dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene [182], propane [77,178,179,182] and isobutene [36,183] and n-butane [77] and methylcyclohexane [31]. Hydrogen permeable membrane reactors have shown to be useful in the selective dehydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols to unsaturated aldehydes, due to the removal of produced hydrogen during dehydrogenation, which results in more progress of the reaction. Table 2 presents some theoretical and experimental investigations on Pd-alloy membrane assisted in different types of reactor configuration."
28,Recent development by research groups and companies,"Recently, Italian groups have been at the forefront of research into membranes for hydrogen separation, particularly on thin film Pd-based alloy membranes. Angelo Basile is a senior researcher at ITM of the Italian national research council (CNR). His research area includes membrane for gas separation [50,229–231], inorganic membrane reactors [232–236], modelling and simulation aspects [237–240]. Adolfo Iulianelli, as a researcher at the ITM-CNR works on membrane reactors [240–242], fuel cells [243–245], gas separation [246,247] and hydrogen production from reforming reactions of renewable sources through inorganic membrane reactors [234,248,249]. Naotsugu Itoh at Utsunomiya University works mainly on functional membranes [250–252] and innovative chemical and separation processes [197,253–256]. J. Douglas Way in Colorado University focused on application, study, and synthesis of new materials such as metals, microporous oxides and ionic polymers for use in novel separation processes include inorganic membranes and catalytic membrane reactors for fuel cells, applied to energy, environmental and chemical processing applications [21,257–259]. The world’s pioneering pilot scale membrane reformer (MRF) had built by Tokyo Gas and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries [260]. A very high purity hydrogen (99.999%) can be produced in this reformer with a production capacity of 20Nm3/h of H2. Tokyo Gas then developed the first 40Nm3/h-class MRF system in 2003 and then modified it for higher efficiency. The improved system with a high efficiency of 81.4% higher heating value in hydrogen production proves the great potential of the MRF system for hydrogen production on a practical scale. Moreover, the purity of hydrogen produced was over 5N, as required for hydrogen refuelling stations [261]. Another pioneering work had started since 1990 in Canada at the University of British Columbia and the University of Calgary for H2 production by Pd based membrane reactors. Adris et al. constructed a pilot scale using a fluidized bed membrane reactor to maximize pure H2 production with a capacity of 6Nm3/h [262]. The common projects between Calgary and UBC have resulted to the foundation of Membrane Reactor Technologies Limited (MRT), which focuses on the commercial development of reformers [263]. Kinetics Technology reformer and membrane module (KT RMM) pilot plant was constructed in 2009 in Italy and the objective is studying the integration of hydrogen membranes in a real steam reforming environment. Generally, steam reforming processes are run at 850–900°C, which are above the working temperatures for Pd alloy membranes. So the pilot plant was built with two stages reformers and membrane separation units for a capacity of 20Nm3/h of pure hydrogen [264]."
29,Overview of recently researches on Pd membrane reactors,"In this section, the outlook of researches done in 2004–2016 is presented. Despite numerous publications in these years in the Pd membrane reactor field, there is no opportunity of describing all papers. Therefore, it is sufficient to mention only two or three of the most important papers published per year. In 2004, a novel Pd-membrane reactor configuration for methanol production was proposed by Rahimpour and Ghader [202]. Their study indicated that decreasing the feed flow rate, as the most important parameter, led to increasing the methanol production. In 2005, Schmidt et al. [265] carried out an experimental investigation on the selectivity of partial hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates in a membrane reactor. Abasharand Al-Rabiah [195] simulated a bench-scale membrane reactor for ethane dehydrogenation using a Pd-based membrane. Fig. 24 shows a schematic of the composite Pd–Ag membrane reactor for this process. Aparicio et al. [196] designed and sized a palladium membrane reactor for H2 production via dry reforming of methane. 95% H2 production yields and a lower carbon deposition in the catalysts were achieved by the membrane reactor operation. In 2006, Basile et al. [266] studied pure hydrogen production of in methanol steam reforming (MSR) reaction by a flat Pd-Ag membrane reactor. Tosti et al. [267] produced a Pd-Ag thin wall tubes with 10mm diameter and 150mm length for application in both permeators and membrane reactors in order to produce highly pure hydrogen. In 2007, Sato et al. [197] conducted an experimental study about selective dehydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols via a hydrogen permeable Pd membrane reactor. Gallucci et al. [198] surveyed the dependency of temperature and hydrogen flux pressure on methane conversion and hydrogen recovery through the dense palladium membrane reactors. In 2008, Tosti and coworkers [268] performed an experimental investigation on palladium-silver thin wall tubes produced via diffusion welding. The results demonstrated the capability of these thin wall tubes for ultra-pure hydrogen production though the production rate strongly depends on the mechanical design of the membrane modules. Barbieri et al. [269] had an experimental investigation on an innovative Pd-alloy membrane reactor in order to analyze WGS reaction. Rahimpour et al. [98] investigated the removal of ammonia from purge syngas of an ammonia plant using a double pipe Pd-Ag membrane reactor. Chiappetta and coworkers [99] developed a two-dimensional mathematical model for WGS reaction. It was found that choosing appropriate values for sweep gas flow rate, feed temperature and pressure has a positive influence on hydrogen permeation, conversion and temperature distribution. In 2009, Parvasi et al. [187] investigated Pd-Ag membrane methanol loop reactors by a set of ordinary differential as well as auxiliary correlations to evaluate the overall processes efficiency. Some advantages of catalytic membrane reactors were described by Lukyanov et al. [14] as below: – Catalytic membrane reformers have the merits of high energy efficiency (≥80%), good dynamic behavior, compact dimensions, and low temperature requirement of carbon reforming. – Combination of catalytic membrane reactors with autothermal reforming are suggested due to their lower complicated heat supply at the reforming zone. – They operation life of the reforming catalysts is high compared with catalytic membranes. Brunetti et al. [100] studied improving features of a simulated reformate stream using a Pd-alloy membrane reactor and showed that the Pd-based membrane reactor can successfully overcomes the thermodynamic constraints of a traditional reactor. Khademi et al. [33] investigated methanol and benzene production in a hydrogen-permselective membrane reactor. Westermann and Melin [270] presented a completed review on flow-through catalytic membrane reactors. In 2010, Tosti et al. [199] carried out an experimental study on a membrane process for pure hydrogen production in ethanol steam reforming. In the study of Bernardo et al. [200] on methane steam reforming with hydrogen permselective Pd-membrane reactors, the results indicated that in situ separation of H2 in the reaction side using steam as sweep gas and retentate stream as a heating utility leads to energy saving and clean technologies. Chiappetta et al. [271] evaluated the feed pressure and studied the effect of catalyst volume, gas hourly space velocity, membrane surface area and methane loading in feed on the membrane reactor performance. Tosti [105] presented an overview of Pd-based membrane for pure hydrogen production. Pd-based membrane synthesis methods, design of membrane reactor modules and the various processes for pure hydrogen production by alcohols and hydrocarbons reforming were described in his paper. In 2011, Rahimpour et al. [191] studied a novel application of Pd-based membrane for hydrogen production in a wastewater treatment loop of urea plant. The effect of pre-reforming on the performance of Pd-alloy membrane reactors was investigated by Miyamoto et al. [2]. Santucci and coworkers [103] focused on the capability of a Pd-Ag membrane reactor in oxidative steam reforming of ethanol for ultrapure hydrogen production. In 2012, Mardanpour et al. [194] developed a numerical solution for the enhancement of dimethyl ether synthesis using a hydrogen permselective Pd-based membrane in fluidized bed reactors. In 2013, Wei et al. [61] prepared a 4μm thickness Pd/Ag/PSS membrane by suction-assisted electroless plating technique. The permeation tests were conducted at 623, 673, 723 and 773K and at the presence of pinholes at 773K, the membrane became unstable. In 2014, Straczewski et al. [272] developed a thin Pd membranes supported on large porous tubes for a steam reformer. In their work, the concept of coupling membrane tube with the reformer-burner-unit (Fig. 25 ) was designed and tested. The burner was placed in the centre, surrounded by the 1st reformer stage. This stage was in contact by the 2nd reformer stage, enclosed by the porous support tube with the membrane coating. There is a permeate chamber between the membrane and the outer housing. Abo-Ghander et al. [273] considered dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in a palladium hydrogen-selective-membrane reactor. The results indicated that intraparticle diffusion resistances were significant, as they not only retard the chemical reactions, but also the driving forces for permeation, as well as the heat transfer. In 2015 Hani et al. applied Pd-Ru composite membrane to perform SMR upon a catalyst with base of Ni in high temperature [11]. Al-Mufachi et al. improved the hydrogen permeability by deposition of Pd thin film on to both feed and permeate sides of Pd-Cu membrane as illustrated in Fig. 26 [274]. Piskin et al. used a third element (Ti) into Pd-Ag membranes to check whether a reduction in their Pd content was possible or not. The results showed reduction of Pd in this three-component membrane Ag-Ti-Pd [275]. In 2016 Wang et al. investigated H diffusion through Pd-Y alloy membrane. They found that in the case of increasing atom fraction Y, H permeability is increased due to the effect of H2 solubility increasing is more than reduction of diffusion constant [276]. Dias Silva et al. developed a dynamics mathematical model for steam reforming of methane process in both types of conventional and membrane reactor. 12.35% increasing of conversion in much lower temperature was obtained in the membrane reactor compared to the conventional one [277]."
30,Future work,"Numerous researches in the field of catalytic membrane reactors have presented in the literature providing useful information. But as the membrane reactor technology is not yet well commercialized, there is no comprehensive information on the cost of this technology. More researches must be conducted on finding an alternative membrane with higher permeability and selectivity during a long period of time at harsher operating conditions. In order to improve membrane technology, some essential investigations will be alluded in following lines: – Fabrication of a thin defect free membrane with high flux and long term stability in various ranges of operating conditions – Investigation of membrane permeability for hydrogen removal from potential coal gas contaminants such as HCl, NH3 and trace metals – A more detailed economic analysis of the membrane reactors – Reduction of required membrane area and pressure vessel size by increasing the efficiency of membrane modules – Optimal use of membrane reactors for minimization of catalyst and hardware cost – Maximization of hydrogen recovery by a membrane with high separation factor – Development of a process technology for hydrogen separation in the presence of a mixed gas feed stream for carbon capture – Energy penalty minimization for CO2 capture via process integration – Use of high stable palladium alloys to tolerate severe process conditions, abrupt startups and shutdowns, and contaminants in feed streams – Investigation on a less expensive and high stable alternative membrane material instead of palladium – Improvement of the durability, reliability and stability of the membrane tubes at common operating conditions – Investigation on the operating parameters such as feedstock composition and flow rate, pressure and temperature on hydrogen production reactions. – Taking into account the impact of inhibitors and poisons on reaction rate modelling."
31,Conclusion,"This review paper deals with catalytic membrane reactors in order to combine the catalytic reaction and down-stream separation for ultrapure hydrogen production from hydrogen gas streams using palladium based membranes. Due to some disadvantages of the pure Pd-membrane, it is recommended to alloy palladium with other metals, particularly with silver to enhance hydrogen permeability. Also, Pd-alloy membranes supported on stainless steel are more superior to other metals for hydrogen separation from the reaction side, owing to their high permeability and 100% selectivity for hydrogen transport. In order to maximize Pd-based membrane efficiency, some useful suggestions are listed in the future work section. A great deal of studies has been reported during 2004–2016 with the concept of membrane reactor. Augmentation of product yield/selectivity and thermodynamically shifting the reactions are the main superiorities of the membrane reactors. This work emphasizes on various hydrogen generation reactions and different types of Pd-based membrane configuration as an appropriate reference for authors."
