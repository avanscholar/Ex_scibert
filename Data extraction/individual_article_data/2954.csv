0,Introduction,"The conversion of biomass to hydrogen is a carbon-neutral process. Produced through photosynthesis, biomass can serve as a crude feedstock to produce lignin, oil, fiber and various forms of cellulose, the latter having promising applications in electrode materials for energy storage [1–3]. Because of the complexity in the biomass structure, a wide range of low temperature and high temperature processes have been studied for the production of chemicals (Scheme S1-1) [2,4]. Metal-organic frameworks have been studied in a number of cellulose and hemicellulose conversion reactions including hydrogenation of furans into fine chemicals (e.g. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA)) and dehydration of sugars into furans [5,6]. Lignin, a recalcitrant biomass, has received attention for two reasons: (i) its potential as a CO2 neutral source for value-added chemicals, and (ii) its abundance as a waste material from the pulp and paper industry [1]. The complexity of the chemical structure of lignin presents challenges in the utilization of lignin. Lignin is a biopolymer composed of three monomeric units: coniferyl alcohol, synapyl alcohol, and ρ-coumaryl alcohol linked together through carbon‑oxygen (C-O-C), and ether linkages [2,7–9]. Cleaving these bonds in lignin can yield valuable feedstocks and chemicals. A number of studies have reported on using electrolysis, hydrolysis, and photocatalysis to convert lignin to hydrogen [10], carbon dioxide [10,11], polyols [12], and various hydrocarbons in the forms of methanol, ethanol, and aromatics [11]. Electrolysis operates at temperatures above 100 °C and high current densities in an acidic solution [10]. Base-catalyzed hydrolysis of lignin requires strong bases like NaOH or KOH at temperatures above 200 °C [13]. Photo-conversion of lignin has been widely studied with various catalytic systems [2,11,14–16] or direct exposure to UV light [17]. Lignin photo-conversion studies showed that lengthy reaction times were required to achieve appreciable yields [17], a high external bias is needed to improve conversion rates [16] and conversion through photoelectrochemical cells are limited by low electricity production [18]. These various processes for lignin conversion are generally characterized by low conversion, low reactivity, and high energy demand due to the heterogenous nature of lignin [1]. Despite the capability of simultaneous generation of electricity and H2, PEC conversion of lignin has not been studied in a two-compartment system employing acidic and basic solutions separated by a proton exchange membrane. The operating principle of a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell in Fig. 1 consists of multiple steps: (1) generation of electron-hole pairs through the excitation of a photoanode by UV light, (2) movement of electrons from the photo-anode to the cathode through an external circuit, (3) reaction between the electrons with hydrogen ions at the cathode to form H2 and lastly, (4) oxidation of biomass by photogenerated holes to form intermediates and CO2 [19–26]. Step (4) is equivalent to the donation of electrons from biomass to the photoanode to consume the photogenerated hole. The performance of a biomass PEC cell is expected to depend on efficient charge separation in the anode, the capability of biomass to donate its electron to the anode, and ion transport through the electrolyte. This work presents the results of a study on the PEC conversion of kraft lignin to hydrogen using a TiO2 electrode. TiO2 is selected because we have carried out extensive studies on TiO2 since Chuang joined Professor Goodwin's group in the early 1980s [27]. We found that photo-saturated currents, which were achieved at zero voltage, increased with UV light intensity, demonstrating the feasibility of simultaneous generation of electricity and hydrogen from kraft lignin. Characterization of the reaction products via FTIR spectroscopy showed the OH functional group in lignin served as an electron donor, to initiate the PEC cycle."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials preparation,"2.1 Materials preparation Dyesol TiO2 glass electrodes and Pt/FTO were used as the anode and cathode, respectively, without further preparation. Lignin (kraft, alkali, Aldrich), potassium hydroxide (KOH, Fisher Chemicals), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Acros), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95%–98%, J.T Baker) were used as received. Electrolyte solutions were made by dissolving the reagent (KOH, NaOH, or H2SO4) into deionized water to make 0.1 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 0.1 M KOH. Lignin solutions were prepared by dissolving lignin into 1 M KOH to make 3 wt% and 33 wt% lignin solutions. Perfluorosulfonic acid membrane (PFSA, 3 M, 20 μm) were used as the proton exchange membrane. The PFSA membrane was pretreated with the following procedure: (1) 1 M H2SO4 for 1 h at 80 °C, (2) 5 wt% H2O2 for 1 h at 80 °C, (3) 1 M H2SO4 for 1 h at 80 °C, lastly, (4) DI water for 1 h at 80 °C. After treatment, the membrane was stored in DI water."
3,Fabrication and operation of the photoelectrochemical cell,"2.2 Fabrication and operation of the photoelectrochemical cell Fig. 1 illustrates the PEC cell with two compartments separated by a proton exchange membrane. The anode compartment consists of the Dyesol TiO2 electrode exposed to a solution of 3 wt% lignin in 1 M KOH or 0.1 M KOH. The cathode compartment consists of a Pt/FTO electrode exposed to 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. The PEC cell was left open to atmosphere during the long-term (15 h) studies under a constant light intensity of 120 mW cm−2 at an applied voltage of 2.3 V to produce a sufficient quantity of liquid products for analysis. Samples were extracted at three time points during the long-term study: 3, 6, and 15 h. The PEC cell is operated at 25 °C to determine if either photo or electric energy and their combinations are needed to drive the lignin reactions. The pH was recorded at each extraction. To determine gaseous products, the anode compartment and the cathode compartment were enclosed and connected to a mass spectrometer (OmniStar™ GSD 320 Gas Analysis System) to monitor CO2 and O2 formation from the anode compartment and H2 from the cathode compartment in the short-term (2 h) experiments. PEC reactions were initiated by exposing the TiO2 electrode to UV light at variable light intensity using an Oriel 6286 Hg Lamp."
4,Apparatus and accessories for PEC,"2.3 Apparatus and accessories for PEC The light intensity was measured with a Newport Power Meter (Model 1918-C). Electrical measurements, including I-V scans, and current measurements under constant voltage were performed with LabVIEW. Gas analysis was performed with Omnistar™ GSD 320 Gas Analysis System using purged gas as a carrier gas. pH measurements were performed with Milwaukee MW102 pH meter. Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, with a germanium (Ge) window situated in a VeeMax III (Pike Technologies) accessory, was used to analyze the dried extracted samples from the anode and cathode compartments. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping was performed on the liquid samples using a Shimadzu Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer. The qualitative XRF analysis shows the 3 wt% lignin solution contains sulfur, suggesting that our initial reactant contains CS bonds and the structure of kraft lignin could be in the form illustrated in Fig. 1 [28]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of light intensity,"3.1 Effect of light intensity Fig. 2 presents the J-V curves of the PEC cell with 3 wt% lignin in 1 M KOH at light intensities 0, 25, 50, 80, and 120 mW cm−2. The J-V curves show two features: the saturated current density around zero volts and a further gradually increasing current density above 0.7 V. The former manifests an attractive key feature of this PEC process: the direct production of electricity and hydrogen from photo energy without assistance from electric energy. The PEC at zero voltage is governed by a rate-limiting step – the step for generation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The rate of this rate-limiting step increased with UV intensity as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The observation of a further increase in the current density above 0.7 V indicates the external electric potential began assisting the PEC process, shifting the rate-limiting step. The role of lignin in serving as an electron donor can be elaborated by a number of steps. First, UV irradiation generates electron-hole pairs through eq. (1). (1) Ti O 2 + hv → e − Ti O 2 + h + Ti O 2 The electrons are excited to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. These photogenerated electrons travel through the external circuit to the Pt cathode to reduce H+ to hydrogen, H2, leaving the holes in the valence band (VB) to react with the adsorbed lignin molecules. Kraft lignin consists of aliphatic, aromatic phenolic and methoxy-phenolic functional groups containing OH and CH bonds, illustrated in Fig. 1. Many studies have shown that CH and OH bonds in organic molecules can serve as electron donors to consume photogenerated holes, producing protons, H+, through eq. (2) and (3), ROH and ROCH3 represent the lignin structure depicted in Fig. 1. . (2) h + TiO 2 + ROH → H + + RO · (3) h + TiO 2 + ROCH 3 → H + + ROCH 2 · RO∙ could further react with another RO∙ to move the electrons from the aromatic ring to produce 2R=O [29]. ROCH2∙ could further decompose through CH bond breaking, producing CO2 and H2O [30]. Hydrogen produced from H+ and e− on the cathode was detected by mass spectrometry, but not quantified (see SI). The organic products analyzed by infrared spectroscopy will be further discussed. Fig. 2 shows the onset of photocurrent began at a negative voltage and nearly reached a saturation level at 0 V. The photocurrent rapidly increased beyond Jsat as the voltage increased above 1.23 V where the electrolysis of H2O is the dominant reaction. The inset in Fig. 2 also shows the effect of light intensity on the IPCE % for the PEC cell with 3 wt% and 33 wt% lignin in 1 M KOH. Previous studies have found that there is a linear relationship between photo-current density and light intensity for the photoelectrochemical oxidation of water [31]. Increasing the concentration of lignin from 3 wt% to 33 wt% led to a drastic decrease in Jsat. This inhibitory effect is a result of aggregation of lignin in a highly concentrated solution. Fig. S2 shows the J-V curves of the PEC cell with 33 wt% lignin in 1 M KOH at various light intensities. For 33 wt% lignin, the relationship between light intensity and photo current density is not linear because diffusion effects limit the adsorption of aggregated lignin on the surface of TiO2 electrode. It is worth noting that the J-V curve from the voltage scanning from −1 to 3 V laid above that from 3 to −1 V. This hysteresis is a result of low rate of ion transfer and long distance between electrodes, resulting in polarization near the electrode surfaces."
7,Effect of pH on long-term currents,"3.2 Effect of pH on long-term currents Fig. 3 shows the current density and pH of the PEC cell with 33 wt% lignin as a function of time under 130 mW cm−2. An initial rise and decrease (overshoot) in current density suggests that the PEC process could be inhibited by its products. Further study is required to unravel this overshoot behavior. The current density decreases within the first 100 min, reaching a plateau of ~0.1 mA cm−2. The pH of the anode compartment decreases with time as the pH of the cathode compartment increases with time. The extreme pH difference across the membrane could cause the leakage of OH− ions. The performance behavior for the PEC cell with 33 wt% lignin under 2.3 V and 130 mW cm−2 is shown in Fig. S3-1. The most drastic changes in pH occurred in the PEC cell with a thin PFSA membrane, shown in Fig. S3-2, the current-time data for a 15 h performance study of the PEC cell with 3 wt% lignin solution. The pH of the anode electrolyte increased from 1.74 to 13.36 within the first three hours of experimentation because the degradation of the PFSA membrane allowed the mixing of OH− and H+. The use of a thick membrane with 3 wt% lignin in 0.1 M KOH solution slowed down the changes in pH, as indicated in Fig. S3-3 and S3-4. Thus, further improvement in the stability of the PEC system using kraft lignin as an electron donor requires either decreasing the pH difference across the membrane or increasing the thickness of PFSA membrane."
8,Photodegradation product analysis,"3.3 Photodegradation product analysis Fig. 4 shows the ATR spectra of the reactant/product mixture extracted from the anode compartment at 3, 6, and 15 h during the PEC study with 3 wt% lignin solution. The decline in the OH intensity in the broad band around 3300 cm−1 indicates the consumption of the OH functional group of kraft lignin molecules, a manifestation of OH involvement in consuming photogenerated holes in Eq. (2). The formation of oxygen-containing free radical species, Eq. (2) and (3), could further react with other OH groups, resulting in the formation of CO bonds or ether bonds. The latter could be related to an increase in the intensity of the IR bands at 1130 cm−1 for aromatic C-H deformation as well as 1426 and 1367 cm-1 for O-CH3 [7–9,17,32]. The lack of significant variation in CH intensity indicates that the involvement of the CH bonding in lignin, Eq. (3), is less obvious than that of the OH bond. Results of XRF analysis, listed in Fig. 4, Table S3 and Table S4, shows the sulfur content increased with the decrease in OH IR intensity, indicating that the CS bond in kraft lignin remains intact. The variation in sulfur content between the sample extracted at 6 h and 15 h is due to the high concentration of lignin in the 3 h and 6 h samples as a result of evaporation. The overall trend, based on the sulfur content of the 3 wt% lignin solution and the 15 h extracted sample, shows an overall increase of sulfur content."
9,IPCE correlations,"3.4 IPCE correlations Table 1 compares IPCE % values which are obtained through Eq. (4). The IPCE values calculated in this work are significantly low compared to that of ethanol due to the wide wavelength range covered by the UV lamp used in the study, whereas the IPCE values in literature are calculated based on a monochromatic UV light. IPCE decreases with increasing light intensity and voltage, suggesting that the PEC process is limited by the number of active sites on the TiO2 electrode. A decrease in the concentration of H2SO4, corresponding to pH in the cathode compartment, led to a decline in IPCE value. At the same level of pH, the PEC of lignin was about 1/3 less active than that of ethanol, reflecting the recalcitrant nature of the CH bond in lignin. The long-term study presented in the SI shows a gradual decrease in IPCE with time as the pH difference decreases. In addition to the potential deactivation of TiO2 anode, the durability of proton exchange membrane should be considered in the design of a PEC process. (4) IPCE λ = ∣ J ph mA cm 2 ∣ × 1239.8 V × nm P mono mW cm 2 × λ nm"
10,Conclusion,"This study demonstrated recalcitrant kraft lignin is able to serve as a reactant to produce electricity and hydrogen in a PEC cell at 25 °C with photo energy without assistance by electricity. Lignin served as an electron donor through OH bond breaking, producing protons and consuming photogenerated holes. The effect of concentration of lignin and light intensity on the PEC cell performance indicated better performance at lower lignin concentrations, exemplified by the linear increase of the saturated current density with UV light intensity for 3 wt% lignin. Long-term studies indicated large pH differences between the anode compartment and the cathode compartment cannot be maintained across a thin PFSA (i.e., 20 μm). Further improvement of PEC of lignin requires employment of visible light anode and improvement of membrane durability."
