0,Introduction,"Hydrogen as clean, renewable energy can be considered as an energy source of the future to replace fossil fuels [1]. Currently, the main path for hydrogen production is water electrolysis, which can meet our requirements [2]. In particular, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a key process in energy conversion of water electrolysis [3,4]. Up to now, noble metals like platinum [5,6] or palladium [7,8] and their alloys electrocatalysts showed high catalytic activity for HER, which can be ascribed to their unique electronic structure. Nonetheless, the widespread application of such noble metals electrocatalysts was restricted by their high price and very limited resources. Thus, extensive studies of alternative non-noble electrocatalysts with inexpensive have been conducted to overcome the above barrier. Nowadays, transition metals (e.g., Fe, Ni, Co, Mo and W) based nitrides [9,10], sulfide [11,12] and phosphides [13,14] have been prepared and used as useful electrocatalysts for HER. Specifically, Ni-based phosphides [15,16] as promising candidates have been attracting much attention due to their remarkable activity and low-cost. Nevertheless, Ni-based phosphides have their disadvantages of low electrical conductivity and relatively inferior stability, which result in limited catalytic performances for HER. Fortunately, carbon materials (e.g., carbon fiber paper [17] and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [18]) were used to resolve above-mentioned problem due to their electrochemical activity, outstanding electrical conductivity and good corrosion resistance. For example, NiP2 nanosheet arrays were constructed on carbon cloth and exhibited excellent performance for HER with good durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions [19]. Dravid et al. reported that a carbon-coated nickel phosphide nanosheet array electrode was obtained by using glucose as carbon source, which exhibited overpotentials of 144 mV at -10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH solution electrolyte [20]. Liu et al. fabricated CP@Ni-P as efficient HER electrocatalysts, which showed an overpotential of 117 mV at -10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 85.4 mV dec-1 in 1.0 M KOH solution [17]. Meanwhile, nitrogen (N) doped carbon materials with high HER activity were demonstrated [21], because the doped N atoms can provide additional active sites for HER and create anchorable sites for metal deposition and coordination [22]. Moreover, the doped N atoms can adjust the surface chemistry and intrinsic electronic performance of carbon structure to make the inert electrons active to HER [23]. As we all know, electroless deposition of nickel is a significantly low-cost method to prepare Ni-based phosphides. Electroless Ni coatings, acquired by autocatalytic chemical reduction with good corrosion protection and high hardness, have been used in many industrial areas [24,25]. In addition, the combination of Ni coatings and CNTs can further improve the performance of corrosion resistance and electrical properties [26]. However, conventional electroless deposition of nickel requires the pretreatment process of sensitization and activation for samples, which undoubtedly increases the workload and cost of catalyst preparation. Here, a simplified electroless deposition without sensitization and activation was used to prepare an amorphous nickel phosphorus on pristine CNTs (aNi-P/CNTs). It is worth mentioning that the pristine CNTs were used directly as raw material without any pretreatment steps, such as purification and functionalization. This is because the trace metal in pristine CNTs replaces the metal palladium obtained from the activation and sensitization stages to induce the occurrence of electroless deposition of nickel. Therefore, multiple intermediate steps were reduced during the overall preparation of aNi-P/CNTs. Then nitrogen-doped CNTs modified by nickel oxide and nickel phosphide (NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs) were obtained via heat-treating the aNi-P/NCNTs."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Multi-walled CNTs (diameter: 60−100 nm; length: 5−15 μm) were provided by Shenzhen Nanotech Port Ltd. Co., China and used without any further purification. Vulcan XC-72 carbon black was received by Cabot Corp. Nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4⋅6H2O), sodium citrate dehydrate (C6H5Na3O7⋅2H2O), sodium acetate trihydrate (CH3COONa⋅3H2O), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2⋅H2O), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), sodium dodecyl sulfate (CH3(CH2)11OSO3Na), chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6⋅6H2O), melamine, potassium hydroxide (KOH), ethyl alcohol, N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and Nafion were purchased from Aladdin Co. Ltd."
3,Preparation of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs,"2.2 Preparation of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs 0.75 g of NiSO4⋅6H2O (25 g L−1) as Ni precursor was added to a certain amount of water and stirred. Then, 0.3 g of C6H5Na3O7⋅2H2O (10 g L−1) as complexing agent and 0.3 g of CH3COONa⋅3H2O (10 g L−1) as pH regulator were sequentially added. Finally, 0.6 g of NaH2PO2⋅H2O (20 g L−1) as reducing agent was added to prepare 30 mL of electroless plating solution. The pH of the electroless plating solution was then adjusted to 4.5 by 10 wt% H2SO4 solution prior to use. In addition, 1.5 mg of CH3(CH2)11OSO3Na as surfactant was added to the plating solution to disperse the CNTs. Moreover, the presence of surfactant can prevent the agglomeration of Ni-P compound [27,28]. It is worth noting that the electroless deposition of Ni does not require the conventional process of activation and sensitization, reducing the cost of production. Simply, 20 mg of CNTs was put in 30 mL electroless plating solution, and mixed uniformly via ultrasound for 30 min. Then, Ni plating was carried out under vigorous magnetic stirring at the operating temperature of 90 °C controlled by water bath for 30 min. The deposition reactions for the Ni and P are presented as follows [28]: (1) H2PO2 − + H2O → HPO3 2- + H+ + 2Hads; (2) Ni2+ + 2Hads → Ni + H2; (3) H2PO2 − + Hads → P + H2O + OH− in which Hads is the hydrogen atom absorbed on the surface of CNTs. From Eq. (1), it can be concluded that H2PO2 − in the plating solution is dehydrogenated and oxidized to HPO3 2- on the catalytic surface. Then the Hads and Ni2+ undergo oxidation-reduction reaction to form Ni and H2 in Eq. (2). At the same time, a part of the H2PO2 − in Eq. (3) is reduced to P by Hads and enters the plating layer. At last, P and Ni form a Ni-P compound [28]. The as-prepared Ni plated CNTs sample was filtered and washed with water until free of impurity and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The obtained sample was denoted as aNi-P/CNTs. After plating, aNi-P/CNTs were heated with melamine at 600 °C for 1 h in a tubular furnace under an Ar atmosphere to produce NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs. The corresponding Ni content determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical spectrometry (ICP-OES) was 4.12 wt%. Pt supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (Pt/C) was prepared using a microwave-assisted reduction polyol method in our previous literature [29,30]."
4,Catalyst characterizations,"2.3 Catalyst characterizations X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the crystal phases and structure of samples. The chemical structure of samples was conducted by X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Model D8 Avance) at 40 mA with Cu Kα (λ =0.154059 nm) radiation. The morphology of samples was characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Perkin-Elmer PHI5300, monochromatic Al KX-ray) was used to determine the surface properties of samples. And ICP-OES was carried out to analyze metal content of samples."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical tests were conducted by an AUTOLAB PGSTAT302 N electrochemical workstation (Metrohm, Switzerland) and a three-electrode system consisting of working electrode, an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode and carbon rod counter electrode. Potential E in this work was referred to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Eq. (4): (4) Evs RHE = Evs Ag/AgCl + (Eo Ag/AgCl + 0.0591 × pH) V = Evs Ag/AgCl + (0.1989 + 0.0591 × 13) V = Evs Ag/AgCl + 0.9672 V The working electrode was prepared as follow: 10 mg of samples was dispersed homogeneously in 1 mL DMF containing 50 μL Nafion solution (0.5 % Nafion in ethanol) under ultrasonication for 30 min. Subsequently, 5 μL of the above suspension was loaded onto the surface of the pre-treated glassy carbon electrode (3 mm in diameter) through a pipettor and dried naturally at room temperature, and the mass loading of samples was 0.71 mg cm−2. In all experiments, 0.1 M KOH solution was purged with N2 for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen. Polarization curves [31] were carried out by sweeping the potential from 0.2 to -0.6 V (vs. RHE) with a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1 to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the samples for HER. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [30] measurements were conducted on -0.2 V (vs. RHE) from 105 Hz to 0.01 Hz with an AC voltage of 5 mV. The electrochemical stability of the samples was performed at room temperature by accelerated durability test (ADT) between -0.3 and 0.2 V (vs. RHE) for 10,000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1. For comparison, samples of pristine CNTs, aNi-P/CNT and Pt/C were also measured under the same conditions."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of samples,"3.1 Characterization of samples The crystal structure characteristics of CNTs, aNi-P/CNTs and NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs were investigated by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1 . The pristine CNTs showed characteristic diffraction peaks at ca. 26.3°, 42.7° and 44.5° corresponding to the (002), (100) and (101) reflection planes of hexagonal graphite (PDF#41-1487), respectively [32]. The diffraction peak of aNi-P/CNTs was similar with pristine CNTs after the process of electroless deposition, indicating that the synthesized nickel phosphorous layer was amorphous. However, except the peaks of CNTs, the other diffraction peaks of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs were well matched with the phases of crystalline NiO (PDF#44-1159) and Ni12P5 (PDF#22-1190) [33], implying phase transformation from amorphous to crystalline occurred after heat treatment [34,35]. More detailed and clear XRD pattern of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs is shown in Fig. S1. The crystalline sizes of NiO and Ni12P5 calculated by Scherrer equation [30] using the diffraction peak at 37.35° and 49.09° were 15.6 and 15.4 nm for NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs, respectively. The surface chemical states of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs were investigated by XPS, as shown in Fig. 2 . The survey XPS spectrum (Fig. 2a) exhibited C, O, N, P and Ni coexist in NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs, indicating the N atoms were doped into CNTs. The C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2b) was well fitted with three characteristic peaks, in which 284.8, 285.8 and 289.7 eV can be ascribed to the CC, CN and OCO [36], respectively. And the appearance of CN further confirmed that N atoms were effectively doped into the CNTs. The O 1s spectrum in Fig. 2c showed three peaks located at 530.7, 531.7 and 533.2 eV, which were attributed to NiO, CO and CO, respectively [30]. The three peaks of high-resolution N 1s at 398.8, 400.1 and 405.2 eV in Fig. 2d were corresponding to the pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and oxidized N [36,37], respectively. Commonly, pyridinic N and pyrrolic N can enhance the catalytic activity for HER by interacting with H+ [38]. For the spectrum of P 2p (Fig. 2e), three doublets at 129.6, 131.8 and 133.5 eV were observed. Among them, the peak at 129.6 eV is close to that of P° (130.2 eV), thus the P in Ni12P5 has a partial negative charge (Pδ+, 0 < δ < 1). The peak at 133.2 eV in P 2p is the oxidation state of phosphorus formed on the surface of Ni12P5 [39]. For Ni 2p 3/2 spectrum (Fig. 2f), the peak located at 853.5 eV was close to Ni° (852.8 eV), indicating that the Ni in Ni12P5 had a small partial positive charge (Niδ+, 0 < δ < 2) [40]. And peaks at 856.7 and 861.6 eV might be originated from NiO and NiO satellite, respectively [30]. The positive shift of Ni and negative shift of P indicate that Ni donates part of its electron to P [41]. The atomic percentages of NiO, Ni12P5 and CNTs in NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs calculated from XPS analysis was 1.48 %, 1.034 % and 85.14 %, respectively. The morphology of samples was characterized by FESEM and TEM. As the FESEM images show in Fig. 3 a, pristine CNTs (Fig. 3a) with a smooth surface were about 60−100 nm in diameter size. The FESEM image of aNi-P/CNTs (Fig. 3b) indicated that a coating was successfully formed on the surface of CNTs after electroless deposition. Compared with aNi-P/CNTs, as shown in Fig. 3c, nano-sized particles were formed on the surface of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs. Fig. 4 depicts TEM and corresponding HRTEM images of CNTs, aNi-P/CNTs and NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs. Typical CNTs with hollow tube structure and smooth surface were shown in Fig. 4a and b. For aNi-P/CNTs (Fig. 4c and d), it is found that CNTs were covered by amorphous coating. In Fig. 4e, nanoparticles were observed grown on the outer surface of CNTs. In addition, HRTEM images (Fig. 4f) showed that the formed Ni12P5 and NiO with lattice parameters of 0.216 and 0.208 nm corresponded to (400) of Ni12P5 and (012) of NiO, respectively. This point was further confirmed by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Fig. S2. The SAED pattern of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs showed the presence of crystalline NiO (PDF#44-1159) and Ni12P5 (PDF#22-1190), in accordance with the XRD data (see Fig. 1). Based on the above data, it was confirmed that NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs hybrid electrocatalysts were successfully synthesized."
8,Electrocatalytic performance toward HER,"3.2 Electrocatalytic performance toward HER To investigate the electrocatalytic performance of samples, the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) was studied. The Cdl value of samples was the linear slope by plotting the current density differences Δ j j anodic − j cathodic / 2 at vs. RHE against the scan rate, in which janodic and jcathodic are anodic and cathodic current densities, respectively [42]. Fig. 5 shows the CVs of pristine CNTs, aNi-P/CNTs and NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs with different rates from 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140 mV s−1 in 0.1 M KOH solution. The corresponding capacitive current at 0.15 V (vs. RHE) plotted against scan rate for pristine CNTs, aNi-P/CNTs and NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs was displayed in Fig. 5d, in which a straight line was obtained [43]. Apparently, the Cdl value of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs (14.94 m F cm−2) was 2.1 and 4.2 times larger than those of aNi-P/CNTs (7.10 m F cm−2) and CNTs (3.58 m F cm−2), respectively, indicating that NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs possessed more exposed active sites and thus better electrocatalytic performance for HER. This is because a large number of crystal defects such as grain boundaries and phase boundaries are generated on the surface of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs due to the precipitation of Ni coating during the heat treatment. The HER electrocatalytic activity of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs was evaluated in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. For comparison, pristine CNTs, aNi-P/CNTs and Pt/C were also performed at the same catalyst loading. In the LSV polarization curves (Fig. 6 a), the NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs exhibited a good electrocatalytic activity with a more positive onset potential (determined at j = -1 mA cm−2 in the polarization curve) than those for pristine CNTs and aNi-P/CNTs. Although the onset potential of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs was inferior to that of Pt/C, a sharp cathodic current rise of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs was observed beyond -0.15 V (vs. RHE). In addition, the polarization curve of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs exhibited a small overpotential of -0.17 V (vs. RHE) with a current density of 10 mA cm-2 (a typical reference metric for comparing catalysts for hydrogen production), which was far better than pristine CNTs and aNi-P/CNTs (Fig. 6b). Apparently, the HER performance of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs was much better than that of aNi-P/CNTs, indicating the important role of the process of heat treatment. This is because the Ni coating was changed from amorphous to crystalline after heat treatment, which can largely enhance the HER performance [44]. Furthermore, the overpotential of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs was even slightly lower than the similar Ni based catalysts at the same current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Table S1). The high performance of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs for HER may be attributed to the synergistic effect between NiO and Ni12P5. The Ni-P bond in Ni12P5 has a weak ligand effect, in which the hollow sites of Ni work as strong hydride acceptors and the P with negatively charged can capture protons [44]. In addition, N dopants in CNTs can increase the electron density of CNTs, which further enhances the HER activity [45]. The kinetic behavior of samples was studied by Tafel plots. And the Tafel slope was obtained according to Tafel equation (η = b × logj + a, where b is the Tafel slope, j is the current density, and η is the overpotential) [46,47]. The Tafel slopes of 214, 142, 75 and 46 mV dec−1 were obtained for CNTs, aNi-P/CNTs, NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs and Pt/C, respectively. According to the classical theory in alkaline electrolyte, the rate-limiting step can be analyzed by Tafel slope values. Corresponding Tafel slopes are given in Eqs. (5)–(7) [4,48]: (5) Volmer reaction (120 mV dec−1): H+ + e- → Hads; (6) Heyrovsky reaction (40 mV dec−1): H2O + e- + Hads → H2 + HO-; (7) Tafel reaction (30 mV dec−1): Hads + Hads → H2 in which Hads is the hydrogen atom absorbed on the active site of electrocatalyst. According to the Tafel slope values in Fig. 6c, the rate-limiting step of samples for HER changed from Volmer reaction for aNi-P/CNTs to Heyrovsky reaction for NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs. For CNTs (214 mV dec−1) and aNi-P/CNTs (142 mV dec−1), the higher Tafel slopes suggested hydrogen evolution occurred through a Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction pathway, in which Volmer reaction was the rate-determining step [49,50]. The relatively low Tafel slope of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs can be ascribed to a strong electronic coupling between Ni coating and CNTs. The exchange current density (j0) [49] was calculated to be 0.049 mA cm-2 from Tafel plot by extrapolation method. Furthermore, the electron transfer kinetics of samples was probed by EIS measurements. Fig. 6d shows the Nyquist plots acquired at -0.2 V (vs. RHE) for pristine CNTs, aNi-P/CNTs and NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs. The equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 6d) consisted of a solution resistance (Rs), a constant phase element (CPE) and a charge transfer resistance (Rct) [51,52]. The semicircular diameter of the NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs was much smaller than those of CNTs and aNi-P/CNTs, suggesting a smaller Rct (ca. 6 Ω cm2) and a faster electron transfer at the interface of electrolyte and NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs electrode. As stability is an important criterion to evaluate the performance of electrocatalyst, the accelerated durability tests (ADT) of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs for HER were carried out. The catalytic stability of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs was conducted by continuous CV sweeps for 10,000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Fig. 7 depicts the polarization curves of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs and Pt/C for HER before and after ADT. For NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs, a slight deterioration of onset potential was observed after ADT. By contrast, Pt/C showed a serious activity fade under the same test condition. To further verify the durability of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs, chronopotentiometry [53] was performed at -0.17 V (vs. RHE) for 20 h, as displayed in the inset of Fig. 7. The fluctuation of the curve is attributed to the generation, accumulation and desorption of H2 [54]. It can be seen that the NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs showed a slight change over the operation for 20 h, indicating a steady HER activity. After the stability test, we examined the morphology change of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the morphology was well retained, indicating the good structural stability. In addition, the surface chemical states of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs were further studied by XPS. As shown in Fig. 7b, the area ratio of NiO/Ni12P5 in Ni 2p 3/2 increased from 1.4 to 2.5. This is because that a small amount of Ni2+ is hydrolyzed to form Ni(OH)2 adsorbed on the surface of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs. Moreover, the Ni content of NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs after the ADT tested by ICP was 3.75 wt%. The amount of Ni attenuation in NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs was small, indicating that it had a high stability during the process of HER. This is because the content of polar functional groups on the surface of CNTs can be significantly increased during the ultrasonic treatment before simplified electroless deposition, and the bonding of carboxyl groups on the surface of CNTs with hydrated nickel ions can be promoted to form CNTs−COO−Ni−. Among them, the formation of CNTs−COO−Ni− enhances the bonding strength between the Ni-P plating and CNTs [55,56]."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, the non-noble metal NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs nanocomposites electrocatalysts were fabricated through a two-step electroless deposition and heat treatment method for efficient HER. The obtained NiO-Ni12P5/NCNTs exhibited good HER performance with a low overpotential of -0.17 V (vs. RHE) when the current density was 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH and maintained high stability of over 20 h without obvious attenuation. Such enhanced HER performance can be attributed to the unique Ni coating and NCNTs. It is believed that the two-step method in present work would be further improved to fabricate promising non-noble electrocatalysts for water splitting and other energy storage application."
