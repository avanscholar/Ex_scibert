0,Introduction,"Dark fermentation is a modified version of the classic anaerobic process to preferentially produce hydrogen (H2), while suppressing methane production. Biological H2 production utilizes organic wastewater or other wastes as raw materials, which contain a variety of organic substrates [1]. Sulfate is a common constituent of many industrial wastewaters, such as an acid waste stream of a synthetic drug plant, yellow ginger processing wastewater, and the pulp/paper, seafood processing and alcohol fermentation industries. These wastewaters typically contain high sulfate concentrations (>20,000 mg/L) [2,3]. The high sulfate content in these wastes has been found to adversely affect anaerobic digestion, and hence, the fermentative H2 production [4,5]. Treatment of sulfate-containing wastewater by anaerobic fermentation results in sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) proliferation [3]. The operational pH value is an important parameter in the anaerobic process, influencing on the activities of SRB and their metabolic pathways [6]. The fermentation process can cause a drop in the pH value in the fermentation reactor; thus base buffer is added to wastewater treatment plants to avoid excessive drops in pH [7]. In a previous study, H2 production and residual sulfate level were decreased with increasing pH from 5.5 to 6.2 [8]. Another study showed that increased H2 production at high sulfate concentrations (3000–5000 mg/L) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 h at pH 5.5 occurred due to increasing concentrations of Fe(II), added to the reactor which improved the bioactivity of hydrogenases resulting in higher H2 production. Therefore, proper sulfate, control and low pH are desirable for better performance of fermentation reactors. Little is known about sulfide toxicity for acidogens during the acidogenic phase while sulfate reduction is highly associated with the amount of H2 production at short HRT [9]. Sulfate is reduced to sulfite and then to sulfide by SRB, which can compete with H2-producing acetogens (HPAs) for the same electron donors such as acetate and hydrogen. The competition leads to the H2 transversals among the microbial species under anaerobic environment [10]. Fe(II) clusters play significant role in electron transfer between the H-cluster and the external electron carrier. Fe(II) not only plays an important role in increasing hydrogenase activity but also enhances the synthesis of H2 contained cells [11]. It can be suggested that processes were accelerated by improving the cell metabolism [12,13]. The decreased H2 production at pH 6, as compared with pH 5.5, was attributed to the increase of SRB activity, which competed against the activity of H2-producing bacteria (HPB) [8], reflecting a complex interplay of various parameters, including SRB, COD/SO4 2− ratios, Fe(II), SO4 2− concentration and pH, in the fermentative reaction. COD/SO4 2− ratios is available for the effect of high sulfate concentrations on microbial hydrogen production [1,8]. The relatively invariant hydrogen production with varying COD/SO4 2− ratios was presumably due to low pH (5.5) at which the activity of SRB was significantly suppressed [12]. In order to obtain an appropriate fermentation system from sulfate and ferrous-enriched wastewater, it would be beneficial to quantitatively predict SRB activity during the H2 fermentative process for optimizing substrate utilization in the H2 reactor. The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of SRB activity on fermentative H2 production in synthetic wastewater enriched with sulfate and ferrous under controlled pH conditions (5.8–6.2). Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis was used to identify and monitor the changes in fermentative microbial populations and allow for quantitative interpretation of SRB in the bioreactor."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge Sludge used in this study was collected from the anaerobic digesters of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Wonju, Water Supply and Drainage Center, South Korea). The pH, carbohydrate and volatile suspended solids (VSSs) were 6.8, 1.1, and 4.8 g/L, respectively, in the seed sludge. Glucose (15 g/L) was used as a substrate. Iron sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) solution was used as iron and sulfate source with concentrations ranging from 0 to 11,600 mg Fe(II)/L and 0 to 20,000 mg SO4 2−/L. Control experiments (without the addition of FeSO4·7H2O) were also conducted. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alkalinity of the sludge were 410 and 2180 mg/L, respectively. The sludge was acclimatized to a synthetic medium (glucose 10 g/L) for 1 month in an anaerobic chemostat reactor. Synthetic medium and the acclimated sludge was mixed in 1:1 ratio (v/v) and added to 4-L reactor, which was operated in chemostat mode at 35 °C with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 h for one month. The mixture was continuously fed to the reactor using a micro-tube pump (EYELA, MP-3, Japan). Prior to cultivation, the reactor was flushed with N2 gas for 15 min to ensure anaerobic conditions."
3,Medium composition and experimental batch setup,2.2 Medium composition and experimental batch setup The medium used for H2 fermentation consisted of glucose as the sole carbon substrate [12]. The medium was prepared daily and stored in a substrate reservoir maintained at 4 ± 1 °C. Hydrogen production experiments were performed using sulfate and ferrous-enriched synthetic wastewater. The experiment was carried out in triplicate using 120 mL serum bottles with a working volume of 80 mL. The inoculum from the 4-L fermenter in chemostat mode and the synthetic wastewater were transferred into a serum bottle (40 mL) in an anaerobic chamber with the flushing of N2 gas. The serum bottle was sealed tightly with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum cap. The pH was adjusted using 1 N HCl and 1 N NaOH. The bottles were placed in a water bath shaker at 120 rpm and 35 °C during the experiment.
4,Analyses,"2.3 Analyses Mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (VSS) were analyzed according to standard methods [14]. The H2 gas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC-14, Japan), using a stainless steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A and Ar as a carrier gas. The operational temperatures of the injector, detector, and column were 80, 110 and 60 °C, respectively. CO2, CH4, and H2S were measured by the same detector, using a 2.5 m stainless column packed with Hayesep Q (80/100) and helium (He) as a carrier gas. Ethanol and VFAs were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu Co., Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a glass column packed with 10% REOPLEX 400. The temperatures of the injector port, detector, and column were 240, 240, and 140 °C, respectively. The pH was measured by a pH meter (Thermo Orion 290A, Orion Corporation). Sulfate concentration was analyzed by an ion chromatography (DX-120, Dionex Corporation, USA) equipped with an analytical column (Dionex Ionpac AS14–4 mm) and a guard column (Dionex Ionpac AG14–4 mm) after pretreatment with 0.45 mm GF/C (Glass fiber filter, Type C). Total sulfide (TS) was determined by iodometric methods [14]. Carbohydrate concentration was analyzed using the anthrone-H2SO4 method [15]. Cumulative H2 production was obtained over the course of the batch experiment, and was analyzed using the modified Gompertz equation [16–18]. SRB concentration was calculated as: (1) Total microbial community (mg/L) × quantitative SRB (%) The specific sulfate reducing activities (SSRA) was calculated from the total sulfide concentration and SRB concentration. For quantitative analysis of the FISH images, specific probe hybridized cell areas were measured by scanning the FISH images, and then used for the analyses of the proportions of Desulfovibrio spp. and Desulfobulbus spp. relative to the total bacteria specifically hybridized to an Eubmix probe. The average fraction was determined from about 10 confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images from image-processing software (IMT i-Solution, version 3.0). The FISH technique with 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes was employed to monitor the changes in the microbial community in the batch reactor system [19]. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and fluorescently labeled with a hydrophilic sulfoindocyanine dye (Cy3) and/or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and/or 6-carboxy-fluorescein (6-FAM) at the 5′ end (Bionics, Seoul, South Korea). The oligonucleotide probes used in this study are specific for phylogenetic groups of HPB and SRB, as listed in Table 1 . Anaerobic samples were recovered from the reactor and fixed in 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution for 3–4 h at 4 °C. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to rinse the anaerobic samples. Each fixed sample was placed in a small aluminum cup overnight at room temperature to allow the Jung OCT compound (Leica Int., Germany) to penetrate the anaerobic samples. Anaerobic samples were frozen at −20 °C and coated with 0.1% gelatin in the presence of 0.01% chromium potassium sulfate and dried overnight at room temperature (25 °C). The specimens were dehydrated by successive 50, 80, and 98% ethanol washes (3 min each) followed by air drying and stored at room temperature until further use. In situ hybridization was performed in a hybridization incubator using formamide at 46 °C for 2 h. Hybridization was followed twice by a stringent washing step at 48 °C for 10 min with 50 mL pre-warmed washing buffer (20 mM Tris hydrochloride [pH 7.2] and 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate). The washing buffer was removed by rinsing the slides with distilled water, and the slides were air dried. The slides were mounted to avoid bleaching and examined with an Axioplan epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) and an MRC-1024 (Biorad, U.K.) CLSM equipped with Kr/Ar lasers (excitation wave length 494 nm and 650 nm) and HeNe lasers (550 nm)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Effect of SO4 2−, Fe(II), and pH on H2 production","3.1 Effect of SO4 2−, Fe(II), and pH on H2 production Hydrogen production and SRB growth at pH values (5.8 and 6.2) and different concentration of SO4 2− (0–20,000 mg/L) and Fe(II) (0–11,600 mg/L) during H2 fermentation process are shown in Fig. 1 . H2 production was observed at lower pH conditions (e.g., pH 5.5), irrespective of the variation in SO4 2− concentration. The maximum H2 production (3300 mL/L) was observed at pH 5.8, and 3000 mg SO4 2−/L, while the minimum H2 production (2175 mL/L) was obtained at pH 6.2 and 20,000 mg SO4 2−/L. Declining H2 production was attributed to the gradual acclimation of microflora to the sulfate reducing environment in response to increased sulfide levels [12]. H2 production increased from 2964 to 3262 mL/L when the sulfate concentration was increased from 0 to 1000 mg/L at pH 5.8. The marked increase in H2 production might also be due to the simultaneous increase of Fe(II) concentration (2900 mg/L) at high sulfate concentrations (1000 mg/L). Iron was especially beneficial for bacterial growth, but an excess amount of Fe(II) (ca. 3000 mg FeSO4/L) could be unfavorable for microbial activity, leading to reduced H2 production [20]. An inhibitory mechanism involving iron oxyhydroxide coatings on a cell surface was also reported by Liu [9], who observed the formation of iron mineral coatings on Shewanella putrefaciens after the exposure of cells to Fe(II). Growth rates of SRB were negligible in sulfate concentrations under acidic condition (pH 4–6), indicating that their growth was not evident at pH lower than 6 [21]. This result implies that SRB could not survive and active at low pH where H2-producing bacteria was dominated. It was also observed that the increase in pH at varying SRB growth rates influenced H2 yield and H2 content in the biogas [8]. The H2 yield, H max, and gas composition under varying pH and sulfate concentrations are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 . The average H2 yield at 1000 mg SO4 2−/L was 1.9 and 1.8 mol H2/mol glucose at pH 5.8 and 6.2, respectively (Table 2). The H2 content was 51, 48 and 46% at pH 5.5, 5.8 and 6.2, respectively. The H2 content reached a maximum of 53 and 52% when sulfate concentration varied between 1000 and 3000 mg/L at pH 5.5. High sulfate concentrations up to 20,000 mg/L at pH 5.5 did not affect H2 production, suggesting that SRB in the culture were not active at such conditions, and H2 production was not influenced by high sulfate concentrations [4,12]. However, H2 content (51 and 50%) was maintained relatively constant at pH 5.8 and 6.2, irrespective of the SRB community, up to 400–510 mg/L at various sulfate concentrations (500–1000 mg/L). Similar results have been observed where SRB metabolic activities did not inhibit H2 production in a fermentation reactor with concentrations under 30 mg/L of dissolved sulfide [13,22]."
7,FISH image analysis of HPB and SRB,"3.2 FISH image analysis of HPB and SRB The FISH images of fermentative microorganisms in the anaerobic reactor are shown in Fig. 2. The presence of Clostridium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens and Ruminococcus flavefaciens as HPB were detected under all experimental conditions. The FISH image showed that Clostridium spp. and Desulfovibrio spp. accounted for 42% and 14% of the total microflora, respectively, at pH 5.8 and a sulfate concentration of 1000 mg/L, based on the Eubmix calculation (see Fig. 2). The hybridization images revealed that the SRB members were increased from ca. 5%–17% in wastewater with the increase of ferrous ion concentrations (580–11,600 mg/L). FISH images showed the ca. 14% increase in the SRB quantity by enriching the sulfate concentration at pH 5.8. Quantitatively, the SRB (Desulfobulbus and Desulfovibrio) in total microbial community was remaining constant between 10 and 16% at the pH 5.8–6.2 even though the sulfate concentration increased. The FISH images revealed that the increase of the feed pH and sulfate concentration leads to increasing the SRB quantity which subsequently consumed more COD and caused the drop in H2 production. This was one of the critical features indicative of a typical acidogenic sulfate reducing reactor, because HSRB acts as a consumer of hydrogen [23]. This is probably due to the fact that SRB tend to grow in small “pockets” at elevated pHs. This unfavorable condition did not encourage the growth of SRB, despite the high sulfate concentration. Therefore, SRB cells were not detected by FISH analysis at pH 5.5. pH increase from 5.5 to 5.8 and to 6.2 lead to an increase of SRB fractions, with an average of 0, 10 and 16%, respectively, at 5000 mg SO4 2−/L. The marked increase in pH at sulfate concentrations from 1000 to 5000 mg/L might be also due to the simultaneous increase of SRB. The remaining fraction of the SRB community in the fermentation reactor is believed to be heterotrophs, which likely offered the potential for sulfate reduction supported by organic carbon [24]."
8,Effect of sulfate reduction on the activities of SRB in the H2 fermentation reactor,"3.3 Effect of sulfate reduction on the activities of SRB in the H2 fermentation reactor Specific sulfate reducing activities of Desulfovibrio spp. and Desulfobulbus spp. were calculated by multiplying MLVSS with the fraction of SRB found in the total bacteria from the quantitative FISH image analyses (Fig. 3 and Table 3 ). The SSRA were plotted against the ratio of Desulfovibrio spp. to the total amount of SRB (Desulfovibrio spp. and Desulfobulbus spp.). Specific sulfate reducing activities increased as the Desulfovibrio ratio (1-Desulfobulbus spp.) increased. Significant variations of SSRA (0.06–0.21 g TS/g SRB h) were not observed under all experimental conditions. However, specific sulfate reduction did not influence H2 production to a great extent at sulfate concentrations from 1000 to 5000 mg/L and from 500 to 3000 mg/L at pH 5.8 and 6.2, respectively. Further, regardless of sulfate concentrations, there was a little difference in the specific activity, with an average of 0.07 g TS/g SRB h at pH 6.2 and with sulfate concentrations of 300–3000 mg/L. This might be attributed to the Fe(II) concentration added to the reactor [19]. The competitive relationship between microbial Fe and SO4 2− reduction is presumed to prevail and that Fe reduction may deplete any available substrate below the threshold level for utilization by sulfate reduction when sufficient Fe(III) is available [25,26]. The relatively invariant H2 production with a varying SRB community was presumably due to a specific condition (≤0.1 g TS/g SRB h), for which the activity of the SRB was significantly suppressed. The presence of SRB with high specific activity (>0.1 g TS/g SRB h) influenced H2 production. This observation is confirmed by the H2 content in our study."
9,Conclusions,"The presence of SRB had little influence on H2 production (1.7–1.9 mol H2/mol glucose) at SSRA (0.1 g TS/g SRB h) or with the variations in pH (5.8–6.2). Increased H2 yield (1.9 mol H2/mol glucose) occurred due to the presence of 580–1750 Fe(II)/L added to the reactor, which enhanced the activity of hydrogenases for higher H2 production. Biohydrogen fermentation could be successfully operated in wastewaters enriched with high concentrations of sulfate and ferrous ions, with little variance in H2 yield (1.6–1.7 mol H2/mol glucose), whereas more variance in sulfate reducing activity."
