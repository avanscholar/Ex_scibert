0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, as a clean and high-grade energy resource, will play an important role in the future energy structure. Biomass is an abundant and renewable resource, which can be a source of hydrogen via thermochemical utilization. Biomass gasification with steam is favorable for producing hydrogen of high concentration [1] and has been studied extensively over the past decades [2–9]. However, hydrogen yield from this conventional biomass gasification with steam is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, and the maximum experimental hydrogen concentration ranged from 40 vol.% to 60 vol.% (dry basis) in the gasification temperature between 700 °C and 900 °C, which is definitely insufficient for industrial applications. In order to stimulate hydrogen production, SEG of biomass with steam was proposed, in which calcium oxide was added based on conventional biomass gasification with steam to capture the released CO2. Calcium oxide can break thermodynamic equilibrium constraint and enhance hydrogen yield in gasification system of biomass. On the other hand, heat released from reaction between CO2 and CaO contributes to energy needed for biomass steam gasification, making the whole gasification system exothermic. Moreover, hydrogen can be separated from carbon dioxide during the process of CO2 capture by CaO. Recently, many researchers have investigated sorption enhanced gasification of biomass with steam. Experimental research on hydrogen production from SEG process has been carried out using a fixed-bed [10–12], moving bed [13] or pressurized reactor [14,15]. Considering realistic applications, fluidized-bed [16] or dual fluidized-bed gasifiers [17,18] were adopted in an attempt to investigate the relationship between hydrogen yield and key parameters, such as temperature, steam to biomass ratio and CaO to biomass ratio. It was found that the addition of calcium oxide made great contribution to the improvement of hydrogen yield from sorption enhanced gasification, and the maximum hydrogen concentration obtained in different studies was from 50 vol.% to 80 vol.% (dry basis) in the gasification temperature range between 600 °C and 700 °C. Obviously, SEG of biomass could operate at lower temperatures and produce hydrogen of higher concentration compared with the conventional biomass gasification with steam (Fig. 1 ). Despite the above significant advantages, less attention has been paid to carbon conversion efficiency in SEG process which is an important indicator used to represent the percentage of carbon in biomass gasified to gas. It is worth noting that some of CO2 was solidified by CaO through carbonation reaction in SEG process, therefore this part of carbon should be considered in calculation of carbon conversion efficiency in addition to carbon in product gas. The maximum carbon conversion efficiency in SEG of biomass was approximately 80% according to previous research [11,15,19]. Hanaoka et al. [15] carried out biomass gasification with steam in the presence of CaO in an autoclave. Results showed that carbon conversion efficiency was dependent on temperature (T), pressure (P) and the molar ratio of calcium to carbon in biomass ([Ca/C]), and the maximum carbon conversion efficiency was up to 79.4% at T = 923 K, P = 0.6 MPa and [Ca/C] = 2. Xu et al. [19] reported the maximum carbon conversion efficiency of 75% at 1068 K from biomass gasification with CaO under atmospheric pressure. CO2 absorbed by CaO was not included in the calculation of carbon conversion efficiency in the research of Mahishi and Goswami [11], and the highest carbon conversion efficiency was merely 63.8% at T = 773 K and [Ca/C] = 1. Nevertheless, in conventional biomass gasification process, carbon conversion efficiency was defined as the molar ratio of carbon in product gas to carbon in supplied biomass, and carbon conversion efficiency up to 90% or higher was realized [6,20]. Apparently, carbon conversion efficiency in SEG of biomass is not comparable to that in conventional biomass steam gasification. One of the most effective methods is to make use of catalysts in order to improve carbon conversion efficiency by enhancing gasification of carbon with steam. It has been accepted that alkali metal catalysts are active for gasification of carbon with steam. And the most effective catalysts are generally the carbonates, oxides and hydroxides; other salts can be activated via converting to these species under certain gasification conditions [21]. The effect of alkali metals catalysts on gasification of coal char with steam was investigated by Veraa and Bell [22] in an attempt to clarify the catalytic mechanism of various alkali metals, and K2CO3 appeared to yield the greatest catalytic activities in terms of a constant metal loading. A possible cyclic catalytic mechanism of K2CO3 was proposed, in which potassium carbonate was first reduced to elemental potassium and then elemental potassium was oxidized to potassium carbonate again. In contrast, Saber et al. [23–25] came up with a different catalytic mechanism, in which two kinds of complicated potassium intermediates (K2O–C and K2O2–C) dominated the catalytic process. Potassium acetate can be activated under heat treatment through converting to K2CO3 [26]. However, the effect of alkali metal chlorides on gasification of carbon with steam remained uncertain. Biomass is characterized by the presence of large amounts of K species, which mainly exists in the form of inorganic salts (such as K2CO3 and KCl) and organic salts (such as carboxylates, –COOK) [27,28]. It remains unknown whether all these potassium species can be active for catalysis in SEG process, which is particularly important for biomass fuels rich in potassium. Bearing in mind what was mentioned above, potassium catalysts were rarely used in SEG process. The objective of this study is to clarify whether potassium catalysts can enhance carbon conversion efficiency in SEG of biomass on the premise of high hydrogen yield. Three potassium salts (K2CO3, CH3COOK and KCl) were used as catalyst precursors in the experiments. The hydrogen yield and carbon conversion were studied as functions of gasification temperature, catalyst type and loading."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation Tobacco stalk, a kind of agricultural waste abundant in China, was chosen as the model biomass to investigate biomass steam gasification. The tobacco stalk sample was dried at low temperatures (<45 °C) and then crushed and sieved to obtain a raw sample with particle size between 150 and 200 μm, which was termed as “RS”. Afterward, the tobacco stalk samples were demineralized to eliminate the effect inherent potassium in biomass particles on hydrogen production. The detailed method was as follows: 1) ten grams of tobacco stalk samples were mixed with 500 ml of 2 M HCl and vibrated for 24 h; 2) filtered and washed by large amounts of deionized water until the filtrate was free of Cl− checked by 0.1 M Ag(NO3)2 solution; 3) dried at 60 °C overnight in an oven under N2 atmosphere [29]. The demineralized tobacco sample, designated as “DS”, was used for all experimental runs and its property was shown in Table 1 . Catalyst precursors used in this study were potassium carbonate (K2CO3, analytical reagent grade) and potassium acetate (CH3COOK, analytical reagent grade) and potassium chloride (KCl, analytical reagent grade). The carbon dioxide absorbent was calcium oxide (CaO, 74–100 μm). During the biomass gasification process, potassium containing compounds catalyzed biomass gasification and CaO absorbed CO2 released during biomass gasification."
3,Experimental apparatus,"2.2 Experimental apparatus As is known, fluidized-bed reactors are more preferable to fixed-bed reactors in terms of maximizing hydrogen yield and continuous hydrogen production for industrial applications. Nevertheless, the aim of this study is to understand whether the selected potassium precursors can enhance the carbon conversion to gas, which can be achieved by using a fixed-bed reactor. Therefore, biomass steam gasification experiments were carried out using a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure, as schematically shown in Fig. 2 . The experimental apparatus consists of five parts: a steam generation system, an electrical furnace, a fixed-bed quartz reactor, a cold bath for tar collection and a gas bag for sampling syngas. Accurately controlled and long-term stable vapor are extremely important, which depends on an excellent steam generation system. The steam generator used in this study is a controlled evaporator mixing (CEM) system provided by Bronkhorst High-Tech. The defined quantity of deionized water and carrier gas (N2) are mixed and vaporized in the CEM mixer. This method is straightforward, and virtually the desired steam can be made in a matter of seconds with high accuracy and stability. The fixed-bed quartz reactor (1.3 m in length, 40 mm I.D.) for biomass steam gasification was placed in an electrical furnace. The cold bath for tar collection comprises three washing bottles filled with some amount of PTFE chips and a cold box filled with ice water. The gas product during biomass gasification was collected in a gas bag."
4,Gasification,"2.3 Gasification Experiments in this study were conducted on the demineralized tobacco sample (DS) of 0.5 g. Meanwhile, the molar ratio of calcium oxide to the carbon ([Ca]/[C]) in “DS” sample was kept constant as 1.0 and the steam flow rate was 0.4 g/min for all experimental runs. Each potassium catalyst precursor was physically mixed with biomass sample (DS) and calcium oxide in three different proportions (5.0 wt.%, 10.0 wt.% and 20.0 wt.%). The catalyst loading refers to the mass ratio of potassium atoms to biomass, which was adjusted to obtain the same concentration of potassium atoms in each experimental sample regardless of catalyst types. As reported by Florin and Harris [30], the capacity of CaO for CO2 capture was relatively high at temperatures from 450 °C to 750 °C. Besides, tar reforming and char gasification was enhanced and their onset temperatures were lowered as well due to the application of CaO in SEG process [31]. It was claimed that the addition of CaO to biomass steam gasification at 650 °C resulted in hydrogen content comparable with that at 800 °C without CaO [10]. It was also found that hydrogen yield from biomass gasification with CaO at lower temperatures (500 °C and 600 °C) was even higher than that without CaO at 700 °C [11]. Consequently, gasification experiments in this study were conducted at moderate temperatures from 600 °C to 700 °C with the interval of 50 °C. In order to investigate the effect of temperatures on hydrogen production, biomass samples were subjected to isothermal heating instead of temperature programmed heating. During the gasification in the fixed-bed reactor, biomass particles were heated with the heating rate around 10–20 °C/s [32], which is a much slower heating rate compared to that in a fluidized-bed reactor (103–104 °C/s) [28]. Therefore, most of the added potassium were retained in the solid phase to catalyze biomass gasification when a low heating rate was used. For the sorption enhanced steam gasification, the mixture of demineralized tobacco sample (DS), the potassium catalyst and CaO were loaded in a quartz crucible, and then gasified in the fixed-bed reactor. Before each experiment, the three-way valve was connected to the atmosphere and the quartz crucible was placed close to the left inlet of the reactor. Then the reactor was heated with a heating rate of 30 °C/min to the desired temperature. Nitrogen was used to flush the reactor in order to eliminate the air in it. After the temperature reached the desired level, the vapor flow containing N2 (1 L/min) and steam was introduced from the CEM mixer into the reactor. When the temperature was stable, the crucible was rapidly pushed to the center heating zone with a quartz rod and the three-way valve was immediately connected to the cold bath in order to obtain the syngas. The gas sample was collected in a gas bag and the sampling time was 20 min. When the test was over, steam was cut off and the three-way valve was connected to the atmosphere again. The solid residue was cooled down under N2 and kept for the follow-up analysis."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis The potassium content in the sample “RS” and “DS” was determined by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, ELAN DRC-e, PerkinElmer, USA). The results showed that the potassium content decreased significantly from 3.98 wt.% in RS to a nearly negligible level in DS, which revealed effective elimination of potassium through the HCl acidic treatment. The major gas products, including H2, O2, N2, CO, CO2, CH4, C m H n (mainly C2H6 and C2H4), were determined by a gas chromatograph (Agilent Micro 3000 micro-GC). Ca(OH)2, CaCO3 and unreacted carbon contained in the solid residue were quantified by a method mentioned by Lin et al. [33]. The solid residue placed in the TGA was heated in two stages: in the first stage it was heated with a heating rate of 20 °C/min to 850 °C under N2 atmosphere. With the increasing temperature, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3 decomposed and lost weight according to different decomposition temperatures. When the temperature reached 850 °C, some amount of O2 was supplied to burn the unreacted carbon contained in the residue. In addition, considering that some unreacted CaO may remain in the residue, which could not be determined by the above TGA analysis, hydration of calcium oxide was taken into account for determination of CaO content in the residue. The carbon conversion efficiency (η) was defined as the ratio of the sum of moles of carbon absorbed in the residue and moles of carbon in the gas to the moles of carbon in the supplied sample: η = ( M r + M g ) / M s × 100 where M r is the moles of carbon absorbed in the residue, M g is moles of carbon in the gas and M s is the moles of carbon in the supplied sample. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, MULTILAB2000, VG, USA) was used to determine the chemical state of carbon in the sample [34]. The BET surface area of the samples after gasification was determined using N2 as the adsorptive at 77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Calcium compounds in the solid residue were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO, PANalytical B. V.)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of temperature on hydrogen production in SEG process,"3.1 Effect of temperature on hydrogen production in SEG process Gas composition and hydrogen yield in SEG process without catalysts were investigated as base cases at three different gasification temperatures from 600 °C to 700 °C with 50 °C as the interval, and the results were demonstrated in Fig. 3 a. As can be seen, gasification temperature has an obvious influence on product gas composition and hydrogen yield in SEG process. H2 concentration increased from 50.7% at 600 °C to 61.1% at 700 °C, which was a 20% of the increase. In the meantime, with the increasing temperature the concentration of CO, CO2, CH4 decreased by 14.0%, 9.8% and 39.5%, respectively. Hydrogen yield was 369.5 mL/g-biomass at 700 °C and 267.1 mL/g-biomass at 650 °C, which were almost 2.7 times and 2.0 times as much as that at 600 °C (136.9 mL/g-biomass). Hanaoka et al. [15] conducted experiments in an autoclave and observed that hydrogen yield increased from about 500 mL/g-wood at 600 °C to 900 mL/g-wood at 700 °C. Han et al. [16] carried out biomass gasification with added CaO and found that hydrogen yield increased from 45 g/g-biomass at 600 °C to 68 g/g-biomass at 700 °C. Furthermore, Thermodynamic analysis was made to investigate the effect of temperatures on hydrogen in SEG process [35]. Results showed that the mole value of hydrogen in the product gas increased with increasing temperature from 600 °C to 700 °C. The increment of hydrogen yield could be attributed to the steam reforming of tars and hydrocarbons [11], which was proven by less amount of tar and other hydrocarbons in the experiments. On the other hand, the efficiency of CO2 absorption by CaO was improved as well within the experimental range [36], which favored hydrogen from water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O = CO2 + H2) due to CO2 removal by CaO. Consequently, the thermodynamic equilibrium of the water gas shift reaction was inclined to move towards the right side, resulting in more hydrogen and less CO and CO2 at a higher temperature. Evidently, for each potassium salt, increasing temperature was also in favor of hydrogen production. When K2CO3 was adopted with a 5 wt.% K loading (Fig. 3b), H2 concentration increased from 53.3% at 600 °C to 68.8% at 700 °C, and hydrogen yield of 669.2 mL/g-biomass obtained at 700 °C was 3.4 times as much as that at 600 °C (197.8 mL/g-biomass). When the loading of 5 wt.% K in the form of CH3COOK was used (Fig. 3c), H2 concentration was found to increase monotonically with temperature from 55.3% at 600 °C to 65.0% at 700 °C, and hydrogen yield of 631.0 mL/g-biomass obtained at 700 °C was 2.7 times as much as that at 600 °C (230.4 mL/g-biomass). In the case of the loading of 5 wt.% K with KCl as a catalyst precursor (Fig. 3d), a mildly ascending trend was observed for H2 concentration and hydrogen yield with increasing temperature from 600 °C to 700 °C. In the meantime, the amounts of CO, CO2, CH4 decreased with increasing temperature from 600 °C to 700 °C for any of the three potassium salts. So it can be inferred that the increase of hydrogen yield was caused by a combination of temperature and potassium salts when potassium salts were used."
8,Effect of catalyst type on hydrogen production in SEG process,"3.2 Effect of catalyst type on hydrogen production in SEG process Experiments were conducted to gain insights into the effectiveness of various catalyst precursors during the SEG process. Considering a more reasonable comparison of reactivity of different catalyst precursors, a loading of 5 wt.% K was chosen for these experiments, and the results were also shown in Fig. 3. Discrepant activities were revealed among the three different catalyst precursors in the SEG process. Firstly, when K2CO3 or CH3COOK was introduced, hydrogen yield were promoted from 600 °C to 700 °C compared to that in the base cases without any catalyst. At 600 °C, hydrogen yield for adding K2CO3 and CH3COOK respectively were merely 45% and 68% higher than that without catalysts. While the temperature reached 700 °C, hydrogen yield for adding K2CO3 and CH3COOK were approximately 1.8 and 1.7 times as much as that in the base case. Nevertheless, hydrogen production was inhibited to some extend due to the addition of KCl. The potassium catalytic mechanism of carbon with steam was extensively studied [22–24,37]. Veraa and Bell [22] claimed that the catalytic mechanism of K2CO3 can possibly be described by reactions as follows: (1) K 2 CO 3 + 2 C = 2 K + 3 CO (2) 2 K + 2 H 2 O = 2 KOH + 2 H 2 (3) CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 (4) 2 KOH + CO 2 = K 2 CO 3 + H 2 O Mckee and Chatterji [37] put forward a similar mechanism of K2CO3 catalysis in gasification of carbon with steam as well. It was noted that production of one mole of H2 was accompanied by one mole CO without any CO2, which was inconsistent with the existence of some amounts of CO2 in the product gas in this study. More importantly, reaction (1) is decisive in the mechanism, and it was found that the free energy of reaction (1) was still positive even at 1300 K [22]. Besides, thermodynamic study showed that reaction (1) would be possible at temperatures above 700 °C [21]. Freriks et al. [38] investigated the mechanism of carbon–steam reaction catalyzed by K2CO3 via TPD and in-situ FTIR, and it was observed that the formation of elemental potassium would not take place below 1100 K. Accordingly, the reduction of potassium carbonate to elemental potassium seems unlikely within the temperature range from 600 °C to 700 °C used in this study. Whereas the decomposition of K2CO3 to K2O was proven to be feasible in the presence of carbon at temperatures about 500 °C–600 °C [39,40]. A redox cycle mechanism concerning potassium catalyzed gasification of carbon with steam was proposed by Saber et al. [23], and probably applied here in this study. The following reactions described the mechanism. Catalyst oxidation: (5) H 2 O + K 2 O – C = H 2 + K 2 O 2 – C Catalyst reduction: (6) α K 2 O 2 – C + α C = α K 2 O – C + α CO (7) ( 1 − α ) K 2 O 2 – C + ( 1 − α ) CO = ( 1 − α ) K 2 O – C + ( 1 − α ) CO 2 The overall reaction is the sum of the above reactions (8) α C + H 2 O = H 2 + ( 1 − α ) CO 2 + ( 2 α − 1 ) CO As can be seen, there were two kinds of complicated potassium intermediates (K2O–C and K2O2–C) dominating the catalytic process. K2O–C formed during heating and oxygen was extracted from steam by the K2O–C intermediate (reaction (5)) and then partly transferred to the carbon in an active form of K2O2–C (reaction (6)). The redox cycle promoted the carbon conversion to gas and hence enhanced hydrogen production. Additionally, Rivera et al. [41] found that CH3COOK decomposed to K2CO3 at 873 K in N2 and catalyzed the gasification process according to the same mechanism as K2CO3. In order to confirm whether the gasification of carbon with steam was promoted by adding K2CO3 or CH3COOK, carbon conversion efficiency was calculated. Fig. 4 shows the results of carbon conversion at different temperatures during the SEG process with and without catalysts. The results showed that increasing gasification temperature was beneficial for carbon conversion. For K2CO3 and CH3COOK catalyzed gasification with 5 wt.% K loading at 600 °C, carbon conversion efficiency of 47.8% and 59.3% were obtained, a little higher than that (45%) without catalyst. At 700 °C, carbon conversion efficiency was increased to 80.7% and 78.5% for K2CO3 and CH3COOK catalyzed gasification respectively, which was improved significantly in comparison with the carbon conversion efficiency of 60% in the base case. Besides, since CaO was used in these experiments, CO2 produced in the catalytic process (reaction (8)) would be absorbed. In particular, when K2CO3 or CH3COOK was used as catalyst precursors, more CaO was transformed to CaCO3 compared to the base case without catalyst, as evidenced by XRD analysis of solid residue samples after SEG process (Fig. 5 ). Consequently, both K2CO3 and CH3COOK can act as catalysts and promote carbon conversion via the gasification of carbon with steam (reaction (8)), resulting in more hydrogen production. The conversion of alkali metal chlorides to the corresponding carbonates (2MCl + H2O = M2O + HCl; M2O + CO2 = M2CO3) seems unlikely owing to the positive standard free energy change. Meanwhile, alkali metal chlorides were experimentally proven to act as inhibitors during the early stages of gasification [22]. In addition, previous study showed that the addition of inorganic additives such as KCl lead to higher char yields, which was ascribed to recombination of decomposition products during pyrolysis [42]. In the light of the above reason, KCl hindered the carbon conversion (Fig. 4) so as to further reduce the hydrogen yield (Fig. 3d). Moreover, it's also worth noting that different catalytic activity in hydrogen production was shown between K2CO3 and CH3COOK throughout the experimental temperature range. The catalytic performance of CH3COOK was superior to that of K2CO3 at 600 °C and 650 °C, which was entirely different from the observation that K2CO3 showed better catalytic activity than that of CH3COOK at 700 °C. There may be another mechanism that CH3COOK catalyzed the gasification in addition to decomposition to K2CO3. It was speculated that part of the added CH3COOK reacted with the carbon matrix (-CM) of biomass during heating through complex routes and formed potassium carboxylate (-COOK). Potassium carboxylate might be reduced on the surface of carbon matrix, producing new forms of potassium compounds. On the other hand, the newly formed potassium compounds would be oxidized to potassium carboxylate [43]. It's evident that the catalyst reduction–oxidation cycle (reaction (9)–(14)) produced some oxygen-containing gases such as CO, which would make contribution to hydrogen production via water–gas shift reaction. Catalyst reduction: (9) ( – COOK ) + C = ( – CK ) + CO 2 (10) ( – COOK ) + C = ( – COK ) + CO (11) ( – COK ) + C = ( – CK ) + CO (12) ( – CK ) ( s ) = K ( g ) Catalyst oxidation: (13) ( – CK ) + CO 2 = ( – COK ) + CO (14) ( – COK ) + CO 2 = ( – COOK ) + CO In order to figure out whether –COOK groups formed during heating CH3COOK and biomass, four char samples were prepared though heating DS without catalyst at 600 °C or the mixture of DS and CH3COOK with 5 wt.% K loading at 600 °C, 650 °C and 700 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the chemical state of carbon in the samples. The peak of C 1s was fitted by four peaks (Fig. 6 ), which were assigned to chemical states of carbon with four different binding energies [34,44,45]. Quantification of functional groups on the basis of peak area ratio was obtained (Table 2 ) according to the curve fitting of C 1s. It was indicated that carboxylic group in the acid form (–COOH) was only 0.32% for char sample at 600 °C without adding potassium catalyst. However, increased amounts of carboxylic groups in the potassium cation form (–COOK) was observed for char sample by adding CH3COOK with 5 wt.% K loading (2.14% at 600 °C, 4.24% at 650 °C and 5.31% at 700 °C) (Table 2). Hence, CH3COOK could possibly catalyze carbon gasification to yield more gas, which would be transformed to hydrogen. Thus, CH3COOK catalyzed biomass gasification according to two mechanisms via transforming into –COOK groups and decomposing into K2CO3, and the former mechanism may occur more easily in terms of lower onset temperature [46]. Consequently, the catalytic performance of CH3COOK was superior to that of K2CO3 at 600 °C and 650 °C. However, some pores might be blocked at 700 °C (Table 3 ) during CH3COOK decomposition [41] so that K2CO3 showed better catalytic activity than that of CH3COOK at 700 °C."
9,Effect of catalyst loading on hydrogen production in SEG process,"3.3 Effect of catalyst loading on hydrogen production in SEG process Fig. 7 depicts the effect of catalyst loading on gas composition and hydrogen yield in SEG process, and the experiments were carried out at 700 °C. For cases catalyzed by K2CO3 and CH3COOK, the amounts of CO, CO2, CH4 were slightly cut down with increasing K loading. H2 concentration and hydrogen yield initially increased rapidly when a 5 wt.% K loading was used, and then leveled off as the potassium loading reached up to 10 wt.% and 20 wt.%. The maximum H2 concentration and hydrogen yield was 73.0 vol.% and 767.7 mL/g-biomass when K2CO3 was used with a 20 wt.% K loading. However, H2 concentration and hydrogen yield dropped slightly with the potassium loading varying from 0 to 20 wt.% when KCl was used as a catalyst precursor. The results imply that 5 wt.% K loading in the form of K2CO3 or CH3COOK can be good enough for improving carbon conversion efficiency during hydrogen production from SEG process in practical applications. The concentration of catalytic sites on char surface increased with increasing the K loading until the surface became saturated when few catalytic sites generated [47]. Consequently, the maximum carbon conversion efficiency for catalytic gasification process were 88% and 85% when 20% K loading in the form of K2CO3 and CH3COOK were added respectively. This explained why H2 concentration and hydrogen yield initially increased rapidly and then leveled off for K2CO3 or CH3COOK catalyzed gasification."
10,Conclusions,"The present study investigated the catalytic effect of three potassium compounds on hydrogen production in SEG process of biomass at temperatures from 600 °C to 700 °C. Hydrogen yield and carbon conversion efficiency would be affected by adding different types and loadings of catalyst precursors. The following conclusions can be drawn from the study: 1) Increasing temperatures was beneficial for improving hydrogen yield in the absence and presence of catalysts, which was attributed to the enhancement of steam reforming of hydrocarbons and the improvement of the reactivity of CaO for CO2 absorption; 2) Compared to gasification without catalyst, K2CO3 and CH3COOK can be activated to form catalytic compounds, resulting in more hydrogen yield from SEG of biomass. However, KCl can hardly be activated under the experimental conditions and can lead to higher char yield, and therefore hydrogen yield was inhibited by adding KCl; 3) Below 650 °C, CH3COOK can be partly transformed into –COOK groups in addition to decomposition into K2CO3, which will catalyze biomass gasification more effectively than K2CO3. As the temperature reached 700 °C, some pores might be blocked during CH3COOK decomposition, which led to lower catalytic activity than that of K2CO3; 4) The enhancement of hydrogen yield and carbon conversion efficiency was realized by increasing the catalyst loading of K2CO3 or CH3COOK, but not for KCl. The maximum carbon conversion efficiency of 88.0% was obtained at 700 °C when K2CO3 of 20 wt.% K loading was used."
