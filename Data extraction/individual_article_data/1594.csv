0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of human society, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels has led to serious environment pollution and climate change [1–4]. To upgrade the energy sector and slow down the global warming, hydrogen exhibits promising potential as a clean, abundant and efficient energy source. The present industrial production of hydrogen, however, is not environmentally benign. Generating hydrogen from water splitting is recognized as the next-generation approach to produce hydrogen at large scale, such as photocatalytic or electrical water splitting [5–8]. The electrochemical water splitting is considered as an ideal and sustainable way to produce hydrogen, which involves two half reactions, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [9–14] and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [15–20]. In practice, the HER needs an overpotential to take place, due to the sluggish kinetics [21–24]. To reduce the overpotential and save electrical energy, the application of effective electrocatalysts is highly desired. Up to now, the most effective electrocatalysts for HER are based on noble metals [25–29], such as Pt, Ir and others, which are featured with excellent intrinsic catalytic activity. However, the high price of noble metals has hindered their applications. Taking Ir as an example, it exhibits high activity for both HER and OER [30–33], however, with price hundreds times higher than Fe. Alloying noble metals with cheap metals like Fe, Ni, Mg, etc. is a natural attempt to lower the cost while sustaining their high activity. Lots of efforts have been dedicated to the exploration of appropriate alloys for HER [34–36]. For example, FeIr alloy have been fabricated and reported by some groups as electrocatalyst for HER. Shen et al. prepared FeIr alloy nanoparticles on Ni foam and used it for bifunctional catalyst for HER and OER [37]. Most recently, Chen et al. fabricated volcano-line FeIr alloy supported by Ni foam for electrical water splitting at high electrical current [38]. Although these findings have proved the high activity of FeIr, the FeIr was supported by Ni foam in these studies, making the intrinsic activity ambiguous. Therefore, the preparation and characterization of pure FeIr alloy nanoparticles are needed to illustrate its intrinsic activity. In this work, to demonstrate the inherent HER activity of FeIr alloy, we prepared the self-supported FeIr alloy nanoparticles taking advantage of solid-state synthesis method. The as-prepared FeIr alloy possesses a novel morphology of pollen, which consists of smaller FeIr nanoparticles. This novel morphology increases the area for active sites loading and is suitable for HER to take place. Through theoretical calculation, it is found that the adsorption of active H species for Ir is too strong, while the adsorption of active H for Fe is too weak. Thus, the combination of Fe and Ir not only effectively reduces the cost, but also can achieve more adequate adsorption of active H species. Taking advantage of the pollen morphology and the improved adsorption ability, the as-prepared FeIr alloy nanoparticle exhibits superior HER performance with an overpotential of 19 mV at a current density of 10 mV/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 32 mV/dec, when tested in 0.5 M H2SO4, better than pure Ir and Pt/C."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis,"2.1 Synthesis Fe powder and Ir powder in nominal atomic proportion are mixed and pressed into ingot in the glove box. Put the ingot into a crucible in a vacuum-sealed quartz tube. Put the quartz tube into furnace, heat to 850 °C, keep it warm for 48 h, and then cool to 25 °C within the furnace at a rate of 5 °C/h. The cooled quartz tube was transferred to a glove box and knocked out. Then smash the obtained sample and grind the sample into powders."
3,Characterization method,"2.2 Characterization method SEM (scanning electron microscopy) was characterized on Hitachi S-4800. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were collected on a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-ARM200F working at 200 kV), equipped with a probe spherical aberration corrector. XRD (X-ray diffraction data) was conducted on Bruker-D8 Advance with Cu K α radiation. XPS (the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) was analyzed on Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250 Xi using Al K α radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV)."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements The entire electrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, Chenhua) using a standard three-electrode system. A glassy carbon electrode (3 mm diameter) was used as a working electrode. The counter electrode was a graphite rod, and an Ag/AgCl electrode was selected as a reference electrode. The as-prepared 5 mg sample, 750 μL of alcohol, 250 μL of isopropanol and 50 μL of a 5 wt% Nafion solution were blended and ultrasounded for half an hour to form a homogeneous suspension liquid. After polishing, drop the 5 μL of the suspension on the cleaned electrode and let the suspension on the glass electrode dry naturally. The electrocatalytic HER performance was tested in a N2 saturated 0.5 M sulfuric acid solution. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted with a scanning speed of 5 mV/s and all potentials were calibrated by Ir. The Tafel slopes were further inferred from the measured LSV. Relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode, the range of measurement of cyclic voltammetry (CV) was from 0.1 to 0.2 V, and the sweep speed was gradually increased from 40 to 200 mV/s."
5,Calculation method,"2.4 Calculation method The first principles calculations were carried out with the density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). We adopted the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) for the exchange-correlation potentials. The projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were used with a plane wave energy 500 eV. To simulate mixed occupation of Fe and Ir, we build a 2 × 2 × 2 superlattice with Fe and Ir randomly distributed. In the calculation stability of hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of FeIr, we cleaved (111) surface with a vacuum layer 20 Å. Atomic positions and lattice parameters were relaxed until all the forces on the ions were less than 10−2 eV/Å for the surface layer atoms and fixed the remaining layer atoms. Only Γ point was used in the Brillouin zone sampling. The stability of hydrogen adsorbed on the surface was described by calculating the hydrogen adsorption energy ΔE H as follows: (1) Δ E H = E s u r f + H - E surf + 1 2 E H 2 , where E(surf +H) is the total energy for the slab with hydrogen atom adsorbed on the surface, E(surf) represents the total energy for the slab model, and E(H2) is the energy for a hydrogen molecule in the gas phase. The Gibbs free energy ΔG H is defined as (2) Δ G H = Δ E H + Δ E Z P E - T Δ S H , where Δ E Z P E is the correction of zero-point energy (ZPE) and TΔS H is entropy contribution. At T = 300 K, Δ G H could be calculated by using the following equation: (3) Δ G H = Δ E H + 0.24 e V ."
6,Results and discussion,"To obtain the morphology and structure information of the prepared FeIr alloy, we performed SEM and TEM measurements. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1(a and b), the as-prepared FeIr alloy exhibits a morphology of pollen, where tremendous small FeIr particles combine together loosely to form a larger pollen. Same morphology can be confirmed in the TEM image, as shown in Fig. 2 (c). Fig. 2(d) displays the STEM image of a separated FeIr nanoparticle, with a representative size of ∼75 nm. The HAADF-STEM image of FeIr alloy is shown in Fig. 2(e), with distinct atomic resolution. One can see the crystal structure of the as-prepared sample matches well with that of FeIr compound, indicating the successful synthesis of the target sample. The atomic plane demonstrated in Fig. 2(e) corresponds to the (001) facets of FeIr, with a cubic symmetry. Another HAADF-STEM image is shown in Fig. S1 with a corresponding line profile shown in Fig. S2. The measured average atomic separation of 0.18 nm matches well with the (002) plane distance of FeIr, which confirms again the high quality of our prepared sample. The element mapping of the as-prepared sample is also measured, with the distribution of Fe and Ir elements shown in Fig. 1(g and h), respectively. One can see that Fe and Ir are uniformly distributed in the nanoparticle. The as-prepared FeIr alloy was further characterized by XRD and XPS technologies. The powder XRD pattern of the as-prepared FeIr alloy is demonstrated in Fig. 2(a). Meanwhile, the peak positions of standard PDF cards of Fe, Ir and FeIr alloy are also indicated in Fig. 2(a) and Table S1 for comparison. Fe and Ir crystals both possess the cubic structure with a space group of Fm-3 m, which suggests that Fe and Ir exhibit similar XRD patterns. Due to the larger atom radius of Ir than Fe, Ir possesses larger crystal parameter and the patterns of Ir shift toward lower angles than Fe. As for FeIr alloy, the XRD patterns should locate between those of Fe and Ir. One can see from Fig. 2(a) that the XRD pattern of the as-prepared sample matches well with the standard PDF card of FeIr alloy (65–4170), which suggests the successful synthesis of the FeIr sample. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe and Ir elements are shown in Fig. 2(b and c), respectively. The XPS full survey of the as-prepared sample is shown in Fig. S3. All the peak positions are calibrated by C 1s peak (see Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. S3, only Fe, Ir and C elements are observed, indicating the high purity of the as-prepared sample. The presence of O can be attributed to the low vacuum. The peaks located around 64 and 61 eV in Fig. 2(b) are the Ir 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 orbitals, respectively, in consistence with the former reports [38]. On the other hand, the peaks located around 725 and 712 eV correspond to the doublets of Fe 2p 1/2 and Fe 2p 3/2 orbitals, respectively [38]. The XPS spectra reveal the metallic states of Fe and Ir in our FeIr alloy sample. The HER performance of the as-prepared samples is evaluated on an electrochemical workstation with a three-electrodes configuration. All the measurements are performed in 0.5 M H2SO4. The HER activity of the measured samples is summarized in Fig. 3 . The LSV curves are shown in Fig. 3(a), where one can see both FeIr and Ir perform better than Pt/C electrode. Specifically, Ir, FeIr and Pt/C exhibit an overpotential of 31, 19 and 52 mV at a current density of 10 mV/cm2, respectively, revealing the extremely high activity of as-prepared FeIr alloy. The Tafel slopes of corresponding samples are shown in Fig. 3(b). Ir, FeIr and Pt/C exhibit a Tafel slope of 36, 32 and 58 mV/dec, respectively. Again, the FeIr alloy performs the best when evaluated from this parameter. The overpotential and Tafel slope of some typical HER catalysts including alloys in acid electrolytes are compared in Table S2 to highlight the excellent performance of our prepared sample. The double layer capacitance is usually used to evaluate the electrochemical active area, which can be derived from CV. Fig. 3(c) compares the double layer capacitance of Ir and FeIr samples. The CV curves at different scan rates are shown in Figs. S5 and S6, respectively. As one can see, the FeIr exhibits larger double layer capacitance, indicating more active sites loading. The electrochemical impedance spectra of corresponding samples are shown in Fig. 3(d), which are fitted using an equivalent circuit shown in the inset. The fitted charge transfer resistance for FeIr is 3.54 Ω, while that for Ir is 12.5 Ω. One can see the FeIr exhibits lower charge transfer resistance. The LSV curve after 2000 CV sweeps is shown in Fig. S7, along with the stability test for 12 h (Fig. S8). The XRD, XPS, and TEM measurements of the as-prepared sample are demonstrated in Figs. S9–S12, respectively. These results indicate the FeIr alloy sample possesses good stability. To further understand the HER performance of the FeIr alloy, density function theory (DFT) calculations were performed to assess the HER activity of Ir, FeIr and Fe, respectively. According to the Sabatier principle, there must be a subtle balance between the adsorption and desorption of active H species to achieve ideal HER process. Therefore, a universal descriptor, the change of Gibbs free energy ΔG features with the thermo-neutrality to represent the superior HER activity. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the optimized crystal structures of Ir, FeIr and Fe with adsorbed H atom are presented for the DFT calculations. The red, blue and white spheres stand for Ir, Fe and H atoms, respectively. The calculated free Gibbs energy changes during HER of Ir, FeIr and Fe are illustrated in Fig. 4(b), with red, blue and green colors, respectively. We can see the free Gibbs energy change of Ir is quite negative, which means the adsorption of H for Ir is too strong. Therefore, it is hard for the desorption of generated H2 for pure Ir. As for the case of Fe, the free Gibbs energy change exhibits a positive value, which means the adsorption of H is too weak to adsorb H effectively. Therefore, alloying Ir and Fe is a possible way to achieve more neutral energy change, which is crucial for HER. The free Gibbs energy change of FeIr alloy is presented in Fig. 4(b) with blue lines. One can see the energy change is indeed more neutral with largely reduced absolute value, which is suitable for the HER. To elucidate the deep physics of the free energy change, the partial density of states (DOS) of the d-band in both Ir and FeIr alloy are shown in Fig. 4(c and d), respectively. One can see the d-band of FeIr alloy can be well regulated by the interaction of Fe and Ir atoms. Thus, the optimized free energy change can be attributed to the movement of the d-band of FeIr alloy."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, we prepared the self-supported FeIr alloy taking advantage of solid-state synthesis method. The electrical catalytic activity for HER of the as-prepared FeIr alloy nanoparticle was tested in 0.5 M H2SO4, with Ir metal and Pt/C as references. The electrochemical data reveals that as-prepared FeIr alloy exhibited high performance for HER, even superior to Ir and Pt/C, which indicates that the FeIr alloy possesses both higher activity and lower cost. The DFT calculations were conducted to explorer the superior performance of FeIr. Theoretical analysis proves that the adsorption of active H for Ir is too strong, while that for Fe is too weak. The combination of Fe and Ir achieves more adequate adsorption of active H species, which accounts for the origin of the high performance of FeIr."
