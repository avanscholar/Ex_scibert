0,Introduction,"Energy crisis and environmental problems have become more severe over recent years due to the decreasing availability of nonrenewable fossil fuels resources, and the greenhouse effect as a result of the uncontrolled CO2 emission and releasing of large quantities of air pollution gases annually, which cause severe health problems for humans and global climate change. Recently, oil remains the world's primary fuel, comprising 32.9% of global energy demand, followed by coal (29.2%) and natural gas (23.8%) in 2015 [1]. It is of the utmost urgency to identify carbon–neutral alternative energy sources to tackle this issue [2]. Among various renewable energies, solar energy is the most abundant and providing about 120,000 TW annually to the Earth. Therefore, the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy (hydrogen energy) can be a powerful approach to mitigate the future energy crisis and environmental pollutions [3–5]. Another process called photoreduction of carbon dioxide or artificial photosynthesis focused on synthesizing hydrocarbon molecules such as CH4, CH3OH, and CO from CO2 which acts as the natural photosynthesis in green plants (Fig. 1 (a&b)) [6], wherein sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll in plants promotes starch and oxygen production from carbon dioxide and water. Furthermore, Photogenerated charge carriers formed upon excitation of the photocatalyst by the absorption of solar energy can also be used to induce the photodegradation reaction of different organic pollutants and dyes in the marine environment (Fig. 1c) [6]. In addition to solar energy, to produce hydrogen, water should be required as the second element in photocatalytic water splitting. Hydrogen production using this green technology is, therefore, a fully environmentally friendly process using renewable and non-toxic photocatalysts, solar energy, and water. In contrast, it doesn’t produce any harmfulordangerousatmosphericgasesorpollution. Therefore, this green technology will be expected to cover the need for energy demand shortly. Hydrogen can be a promising choice for future energy demand because it is storable, renewable, a green source of energy with no CO2 emissions and can easily be used in fuel cells for the generation of electricity. Hydrogen has higher energy content per unit of weight (120.7 kJ/g), compared to any of the known nonrenewable hydrocarbon fuels and is considered to be the major energy source for the future [7,8]. Furthermore, Hydrogen is a gas at ambient conditions that can be used like gasoline as a transport fuel [9]. It can be easily stored as pressurized gas and liquid compounds and easily distributable through the pipeline [10]. Currently, the main hydrogen storage technologies are classified into the physical and chemical methods; compressed, liquefied are related to the physical methods, whereas solid-state and chemical hydrogen storage technologies are chemical methods of hydrogen storage. Although both methods are widely used in hydrogen storage technologies, still they are facing some challenges, for example, in compressed hydrogen storage, high energy, and high-pressure tank require for this method. These storage tanks are manufactured from carbon nanofibers, which is very expensive. High energy and super insulation tank are demanded the liquefaction of hydrogen, which is not easy to eliminate all heat by the insulation that leads to losing some hydrogen to keep the pressure in the tank at a safe level. Solid-state storage materials refer to the storage of hydrogen in metal hydrides are allocated into two: reversible hydrides and physisorption (porous) materials. Reversible hydrides need relatively high temperatures (>100 °C) to operate, and they suffer from reversibility issues. Besides, reversible hydrides suffer from degradation over cycles. Additionally, during hydrogen discharging from hydrides, it’s possible that some toxic gases (NH3) can be produced, which can be detrimental to the operation of a fuel cell. Porous materials operate at cryogenic temperatures (77 K) to store a significant amount of hydrogen, and their drawback is the cost associated with cooling. The problem is that high-surface-area porous materials tend to have low material densities and therefore only modest volumetric hydrogen storage capacities. For the chemical hydrogen storage, no onboard regeneration is possible and a heat management system is required, and the regeneration itself is a costly process.Thus, energy-efficient and inexpensive regeneration processes have to be developed. However, most annual hydrogen production (44.5 million tons) is used for the production of ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH), and a very small amount of it is used for energy purposes [11,12]. Many clean and sustainable solutions to synthesize hydrogen and avoid using fossil fuel as the key source of energy have been established in recent years. For instance, Naseri et al. [13] reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of the current nonrenewable methods used for hydrogen production. Nowadays, 95% of global hydrogen production comes from nonrenewable fossil fuel [14]; photocatalytic hydrogen production via water splitting using renewable solar energy and photocatalyst is the most attractive and renewable approach among all the traditional hydrogen production technologies. Fig. 2 [15] displays a schematic diagram using sunlight, photocatalyst, and water to produce photocatalytic hydrogen in the hydrogen energy system."
1,TiO2 photocatalyst,"1.1 TiO2 photocatalyst Titanium dioxide (TiO2) or titania is a very well-known and researched material due to its high photostability, photocatalytic activity, non-toxicity, and availability [16]. Up to now, TiO2 nanoparticles have been applied in photocatalytic hydrogen production via water-splitting [17,18], degradation of organic pollutants in the wastewater [19,20], photocatalytic self-cleaning [21], bacterial disinfection [22,23], photo-induced super hydrophilicity [24,25] as well as in photovoltaics [26,27], and photosynthesis [28]. TiO2 crystallizes in three common phases; anatase, rutile, and brookite phases (Fig. 3 ) [29]. Anatase type TiO2 has a tetragonal crystal structure each octahedron shares corners to form (001) planes and is used mainly in photocatalysis. Rutile type TiO2 also has a tetragonal crystal structure consists of edge-sharing octahedrons forming the (001) planes and is mainly used as a white pigment in paint. Brookite type TiO2 has an orthorhombic crystalline structure that is made up of both corner and edge-sharing octahedral. Anatase TiO2 is more favorable than rutile and brookite as it has better performance for photocatalytic H2 production [30] due to the faster charge carrier separation, higher kinetic stability, and suitable bandgap energy [31]. Titanium dioxide usually exists as an n-type semiconductor (electrons are the majority charge carrier) [32]. Crystalline TiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles (<10 nm) show higher photocatalytic activity performance than amorphous due to the reduction of the photoexcited electron-hole recombination and quantum size effect, respectively [33–35]. However, titania still has drawbacksforbroad-scale photocatalysis that attributed to the large bandgap energy, which cannot be excited under visible irradiation that occupies 46% of the solar spectrum as well as fast charge carriers recombination [36,37]. Nevertheless, TiO2 nanomaterials remain the most studied nanomaterials for hydrogen generation is shown in Fig. 4 [38]. To enhance the performance of photocatalytic activities particularly for visible light irradiation, numerous methods have been developed to increase the photocatalytic efficiency, such as metal and nonmetal ion doping, noble metal loading, semiconductors coupling to TiO2, and dye sensitization, which will be discussed in more details in the second part."
2,Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting,"1.2 Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting H2 is an ideal clean fuel of the future because it can be produced from renewable energy sources and causes no pollution, thus the whole production process is green and renewable [39,40]. Photocatalytic hydrogen production via water-splitting using renewable sources, such as water and solar energy is widely accepted as a possible solution to solve the global energy crisis [41] since the feasibility of producing H2 using UV light in a photoelectrochemical cell was first illustrated by Japanese scientists Fujishima and Honda in the year 1972 using the semiconductor material titanium dioxide (TiO2) (Fig. 5 a) [42], but the development of high efficient photocatalysts for solar energy induced hydrogen production via water splitting still have some challenges and is, thus often mentioned as a “holy grail” in photocatalysis [43,44]. Especially, most oxide and mixed oxide photocatalysts are able to split water are only active under UV irradiation, which occupies around 4% of the total solar energy. Therefore, it is very important to search for photocatalysts that are active under sunlight energy, efficient, thermal and chemical stability, low-cost, and non-toxic. To date, various semiconductors have been explored to split water under light irradiation with suitable cocatalysts loaded on the surface; such as metal oxide, nitride, and sulfide [45–47]. Unfortunately, the relatively low quantum yield efficiency and high expensive noble metal-containing materials (cocatalyst) of these systems make them unfavorable for practical usage. In typical photocatalysis processes, semiconductor photocatalysts, such as TiO2, ZnO, and ZnS, are initially activated by incoming photons provided by either ultraviolet (UV) or visible-light irradiation. When sufficient photochemical energy is applied, electrons can be excited from the VB to the CB of the semiconductors, leaving positively charged holes in the VB. After that, electrons and holes should be separated and transferred to the surface of the photocatalyst to initiate the redox reactions to produce H2 (Eqn: (1)) and O2 (Eqn: (2)), respectively. (1) Photoreduction: 4H + 4e_ → 2H2, E0 = 0 V vs. NHE (2) Photooxidation: H2O + 2 h+ → O2 + 2H+ + 4e_ , E0 = 1.23 V vs. NHE A schematic diagram of the fundamental principle of photocatalytic water splitting is shown in Fig. 5b [48]. However, photocatalyst should lower bandgap energy (3.0 e.V > Eg > 1.23 eV) to be active under visible light irradiation. For thermodynamic reasons the CB has to be more negative than H+/H2 0 V, whereas the VB has to be more positive than O2/H2O 1.23 V. Overpotentials due to kinetic limitations require band positions for the CB more negative than about −0.3 V and the VB more positive than about 1.5 V. On the other hand, photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC) follows the same principle described by Fujishima and Honda. In Principle, the photoelectrochemical cell has two electrodes, TiO2 and Pt electrodes. Under light irradiation of TiO2, electron and hole pairs are generated, the holes oxide water at TiO2 electrode, whereas, the photogenerated are transferred to the Pt electrode to reduce water to hydrogen gas [49]. In the PEC technique, the photoactive semiconductor (photocatalyst) should be attached to the conductive substrate, which acts as electrode and a small bias was applied to achieve the water splitting. Additionally, the charge separation of this technique was attained at the semiconductor/liquid interface. The advantage of this techniques compared to the photocatalytic system is that no need for gas separation because the generated oxygen and hydrogen are formed on different electrodes. Fig. 6 [50] shows the bandgaps and the VB and CB positions of the three commonly known polymorphs of TiO2: anatase (tetragonal), rutile (tetragonal, the most thermodynamically stable phase), and brookite (orthorhombic) relative to the redox potential of water at pH = 7. As presented in Fig. 6, the low activity of the rutile TiO2 is mainly assigned to the position of the flat band potential, which locates at almost a similar level to the reduction potential of the proton, whereas that of anatase TiO2 is shifted negatively by ca. 0.2 eV (Fig. 6). Thus, the electrons of the conduction band energy of anatase TiO2 would be higher than that for rutile TiO2. A more cathodic conduction band potential energetically favors proton/water reduction to hydrogen, explaining the higher activity of the former toward hydrogen production. Furthermore, it is important to arrange the photocatalytic system e.g. by the addition of suitable cocatalysts, such that the photo-induced charges are separated efficiently in order to suppress bulk/surface electron/hole recombination as much as possible. Previous studies were carried out on some narrow bandgap semiconductors such as CdS [51,52] and WO3 [53,54] with band gaps around 2.4 eV. However, the fact that serious photocorrosion was observed for CdS and that WO3 is like Fe2O3 (bandgap of 2.2 eV) not able to form H2 directly, limits their applicability [55]. In addition, several studies were reported on common metal oxides, such as TiO2 [56], ZnO [57], and ZrO2 [58] for hydrogen production activity, but their large bandgap energy leads to them being inefficient in sunlight. To overcome these obstacles, many efforts have been made to develop new visible-light-driven photocatalysts with high water-splitting activity [59,60]. Several common approaches [61,62] have been adopted (1) metal or/and nonmetal ions doping for bandgap narrowing; (2) developing solid solutions to control the band structure; (3) dye sensitization to make UV-light-active photocatalysts harvest visible light; (4) developing novel single-phase Vis-active photocatalysts through bandgap engineering. Binary metal compounds, such as BiVO4 [63], have emerged very recently as the state-of-the-art solar absorber material with a bandgap similar to that of Fe2O3."
3,Factors affecting the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts and modification techniques used to improve the efficiency of TiO2-Based photocatalysts,
4,Factors affecting the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts,"2.1 Factors affecting the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts 2.1.1 Surface area and particle size of the photocatalysts The photocatalytic activity of a catalyst is highly correlated to the specific surface area and the particle size of the catalyst because a catalyst with a higher specific surface area and small particle size possesses more surface active sites and possibly promotes the interfacial charge separation [64,65]. It has been reported that TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit higher photocatalytic activity performance compared to the TiO2 microparticles that ascribed to the small diameter, in which the charge required the minimal effort to reach the surface and initiate the redox reaction [66]. Therefore, with decreasing in particle size, the travel distance needs for the photogenerated charge carriers is reduced, thus, reducing the charge recombination. However, achieving a high specific surface area with a smaller particle size photocatalyst is heavily dependent on the temperature used in the synthesis process, which is why applying the sol–gel approach to the photocatalysts synthesis is considered a promising route to obtain materials with these characteristics compared to the solid-state reaction. Several studies have reported that photocatalysts in the form of nanoparticles are more effective than bulk powders [67,68]. For instance, Chiarello et al. [69] designed and prepared a set of Au-modified TiO2 photocatalysts by flame spray pyrolysis, accompanied by remarkably enhanced performance for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. The Au deposited on TiO2 surfaces in the Au-TiO2 is beneficial for enlarging the surface area and improving crystallinity, which can strengthen the charge separation in space. Porosity has a great influence on enlarging the specific surface area of the photocatalyst. For instance, nanocrystalline TiO2 particles on porous hosts (SBA-15 and ZSM-15) were fabricated via a sol–gel impregnation method by Jiang et al. [70].The porous TiO2 particles (TiO2/ZSM-5 and TiO2/SBA-15) show a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen production under full arc (Fig. 7 a&b), which could be ascribed to the smaller TiO2 particle size and higher surface area providing by the porous structure of the obtained photocatalyst. For instance, Xu et al. [71] constructed (CuO-TNT, TNT: nanotubes) by introducing highly dispersed CuO into TiO2 nanotube by hydrothermal method or wet impregnation process. Results showed that the visible-light performance of H2 production for CuO-TNT photocatalyst is significantly improved compared to a single semiconductor. The tubular structure, large BET surface area, and high dispersion of copper components are responsible for the higher H2 production. El-Maghrabi et al. [72] reported a simple method for the synthesis of mesoporous core–shell CdS@TiO2 photocatalysts for enhanced H2 evolution under solar irradiation in the presence of a sacrificial agent and Pt as cocatalyst (Fig. 8 a). The mesoporous core–shell structure of the synthesized photocatalyst leads to an increase in the specific surface area, which facilitates the charge transport and separation confirmed by photocurrent and electrochemical impedance measurements (Fig. 8b&c) and inhibit charge recombination in visible light (Fig. 8d). Sreethawong et al. [73] investigated N-doped mesoporous-assembled TiO2 and N-doped nanocrystals in photocatalytic H2 production.The results indicated that the mesoporous structure of the photocatalyst is responsible for enhancing the photocatalytic activity by increasing the specific surface area. Meanwhile, Martha et al. [74] fabricated a series of novel V2O5/N, S-TiO2 composite photocatalysts by a solid-state reaction route. The photocatalytic applications of the composite materials were evaluated for visible-light hydrogen production and direct sunlight phenol degradation. V2O5/N, S–TiO2 activated at 500 °C showed the highest activity for the two photocatalytic reactions that mainly ascribed to the enhancement of the surface area and charge separation. In another interesting study, Chaugule et al. [75] significantly obtained a novel catalyst system composed of Sm and Ni oxide doped titanium oxide nanofiber with enhanced photocatalytic activities for visible fuel production using NaBH4. The enhancement could be attributed to the higher surface area and pore size of Sm-Ni oxide of the doped TiO2 nanofiber (Fig. 9 a&b) [75]. Rungjaroentawon et al. [76] used Eosin Y-sensitized mesoporous-assembled TiO2–SiO2 photocatalyst for hydrogen production. Mixed oxide photocatalysts were synthesized via the sol–gel method using the structure-directing agent. Results indicated that the 97:3 TiO2 to SiO2 ratio exhibited the highest activity, which can be ascribed to the high surface area and small crystalline size. Moreover, Parayil et al. [77] successfully obtained TiO2 aerogel using the high-temperature sol–gel method. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 aerogel was investigated for hydrogen production. Among all prepared photocatalysts, TiO2-6 h shows superior activity without using Pt due to increased surface area and reduces particle size. Furthermore, particle size and surface area of nano-TiO2 powders can also be affected by precursor concentration, and calcination temperature [78]. Puskelova et al. [79] also successfully obtained TiO2/Pt aerogel nanocomposites by a combined sol–gel-supercritical drying strategy, and firstly utilized this nanocomposite in visible-light photocatalytic H2-production containing aqueous ethanol solution. The highest activity was obtained for the photocatalyst with smaller particle sizes (Fig. 10 a) and a high specific surface area (Fig. 10b). In another study, Qiu et al. [80] prepared TiO2 hierarchical/nanowires junction using a combined hydrothermal and calcination method for the determination of hydrogen production in the presence of Pt as a cocatalyst. Photocatalyst calcined at 450 loads 0.5 wt% Pt exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen activity (Fig. 11 a) that attributed to the large surface area (Fig. 11b). Monoclinic phase and anatase phase composite loaded with CuNi alloy nanoparticles in the presence of ammonia borate was used as photocatalyst and tested for hydrogen production reported by Wang et al. [81]. Photocatalyst was synthesized using combined hydrothermal and impregnation methods. The highest photocatalytic hydrogen production was obtained for a photocatalyst calcined at 700 °C (Fig. 12 a&b) containing 36% Cu and 64% Ni, which was mainly assigned to the role of CuNi alloy nanoparticles in enhancing charge separation efficiency (Fig. 12c) as well as for the high surface area (Fig. 12d). In another study, Liu et al. [82] studied the influence of particle size on the photocatalytic hydrogen production of Ba/SrTiO3 cores/TiO2 shell heterostructure prepared using the facile sol–gel method. The maximum hydrogen production activity was observed for the photocatalyst calcined at 600 °C with 100–150 nm thick in presence of 1 wt% Pt as cocatalyst. The work of Chen et al. [83] for example, demonstrated that Nanorod-like TiO2 photocatalysts were successfully achieved by simple hydrothermal and ion-exchange methods, showing highly effective visible-light performance concerning bare TiO2 (P25) that ascribed to the high surface area and better crystallinity. Furthermore, Yang et al. [84] successfully constructed a core–shell structure containing carbon-doped TiO2 and metallic TiC. The photocatalytic activity of the core–shell photocatalyst was tested for hydrogen production in presence of aqueous methanol as a sacrificial reagent. Results have clearly shown that the core–shell structure exhibited higher photocatalytic performance compared to pure TiO2, which may be assigned to the large surface area and efficient charge transfer. 2.1.2 Calcination temperature Calcination temperatures have a prominent effect on the prepared photocatalysts morphology, surface area, pore-volume, crystallinity, crystallite size, and phase structure, and these influences have also impacted their evolutionary photocatalytic behavior. Wu et al. [85] studied the effect of the thermal treatment on the photocatalytic activity of the well-crystallized titania nanorods thin film toward degradation of RhB. Their study showed that the highest activity of the thin film was achieved when the film was thermally treated at 450 °C. At higher thermal treatment, the photocatalytic activity was decreased due to the reduced specific surface area. It has been observed that the anatase phase of TiO2 obtained at lower temperature shows better photocatalytic hydrogen production activity than the rutile one [86]. Thus, the synthesis method and calcination temperature should be optimized to obtain the high active anatase phase of TiO2. For instance, Naik et al. [87] prepared free-template mesoporous Bi2O3/TiO2-xNx nanocomposites via simple co-precipitation technique at different calcination temperatures for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. Inspiringly, the photocatalyst sample calcined at 400 °C showed the highest activity, which can be assigned to the enlargement of the surface area and high crystallinity. Similarly, Parida et al. [88] prepared hierarchical and fibrous meso-macroporous N-doped TiO2 without using templates at different calcination temperatures (300–800 °C). The result indicated that the photocatalyst calcined at 400 °C presents the highest hydrogen production activity (Fig. 13 a). Moreover, the crystalline anatase phase (Fig. 13b), optimized visible light absorption (Fig. 13c), and the improvement of the charge separation provided by the special morphology and porosity of the catalyst (Fig. 13d), are the key factors for the enhanced photocatalytic activity. Besides, calcination temperature, crystallinity, surface area are strongly affected hydrogen production activity. Herein, the sample calcined at 400 °C has good crystallinity compared to that calcined at 300 °C, it has a high surface area and pure phase titania compared to that photocatalysts calcined at the higher temperature (500–800 °C). Thus, it shows the highest activity. To investigate the effect of calcination temperature on the morphology of the obtained photocatalyst, Wei et al. [89] loaded Pt nanoparticles (using H2PtCl6 as a precursor for the cocatalyst, Pt oxidation number is 4 + ) over TiO2 microspheres by impregnation reaction combined hydrothermal method. The highest photocatalytic hydrogen production was obtained for the photocatalyst loaded with 1.2 wt% Pt and calcined at 500 °C (Fig. 14 a&b). The sol–gel process was used by Wu et al. [90] to decorate Pd-calcined black TiO2 nanoparticles in an argon atmosphere. The photocatalyst obtained was checked at various calcination temperatures for hydrogen production. For the photocatalyst calcined at 400 °C, the maximum behavior was recorded. (Fig. 15 a&b). Also, the highest activity was attributed to the enhancement of light absorption (Fig. 15c&d). Long et al. [91] fabricated CdS/TiO2 composites by wetness impregnation at different calcination temperatures (300–500 °C) for the determination of hydrogen production activity. Photocatalyst calcined at 500 °C presents the highest activity due to the excellent crystallinity. In order to investigate the influence of calcination temperature on the phase formation of titania, Qiu et al. [92] showed that mixed-phase consisting of 67 wt% anatase and 33 wt% rutile exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen production activity that attributed to the high stability and good crystallinity. In another study, Hui et al. [93] prepared nitrogen-doped SrTiO3/TiO2 composite employing solid-state reaction and sol–gel method. Photocatalytic hydrogen production of the obtained photocatalyst in oxalic acid solution was evaluated under visible light at different calcination temperatures (350–550 °C). Photocatalyst calcined at 400 °C and loaded with 2 wt% Pt shows the highest activity. Moreover, Huang et al. [94] studied the effect of post thermal temperature on photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2 film. Results showed that the TiO2 thin film calcined at 500 °C exhibited higher hydrogen and oxygen production activity as well as higher photocurrent intensity compared to that calcined at 700 °C. Photoelectrochemical cells consisting of TiO2 nanotube photoanode and Pt/C cathode were constructed by Li and coworkers [95]. TiO2 nanotube was calcined at different calcination temperatures. The photocatalytic activities of photocatalysts were assessed for hydrogen production in the photoelectrochemical cell. Results showed that the TiO2 nanotube photoanode showed the best activity. Peng et al. [96] prepared Be2+ doped TiO2 photocatalysts using combined impregnation and coprecipitation method. The highest hydrogen production activity was obtained for the doped photocatalyst calcined at 400 °C for 1 h. at this calcination temperature, the doped photocatalyst shows the best crystallinity. Li et al. [97] successfully constructed a g-C3N4-TiO2 heterojunction for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. A g-C3N4-TiO2 heterojunction calcined at 600 °C exhibited the highest activity. The composite formation between the two semiconductors and the nanosheet structure of graphitic carbon nitride facilitate charge transport and separation. Interestingly, Reddy et al. [98] designed CaFe2O4/TiO2 composite using titania nanosheet and low bandgap calcium ferrites. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples was investigated for hydrogen production. 1% wt calcium ferrite over titania calcined at 400 °C exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen activity (Fig. 16 a&b). Chang et al. [99] studied the hydrogen production activity of gold doped-TiO2-MO x photocatalysts calcined at different calcination temperatures. Importantly, Au/TiO2-Fe2O3 photocatalyst dried at 373 K in the air without calcination showed the best hydrogen production activity in the presence of methanol. In another study, Lee et al. [100] synthesized TiO2/CuO composite nanofibers using the electrospinning method. The photocatalytic activity of the composite was tested for hydrogen production in an aqueous solution containing methanol as a sacrificial reagent. Results show that 6 mol % Cu, calcined at 450 °C exhibited the highest activity. Recently, Vásquez et al. [101] hydrothermally synthesized a nanostructured material composed of Fe2O3 and TiO2 oxides. After that, the samples were calcined at 400, 700, and 1000 °C. Their findings showed that the sample calcined at 1000 °C has the highest activity attributed to the transformation of magnetite into more active photocatalytically phases (hematite) driven by the changes in surface morphology. Besides, surface area and particle size, and calcination temperature, bandgap energy of the photocatalyst are also a very important parameter that affects its light absorption. To make a photocatalyst visible-light active, bandgap energy should be narrowed. Various bandgap engineering techniques are developed by the researchers across the globe mentioned in Section 2.2.1, 2.2.2, and 2.2.3. Besides, several approaches used to enhance the charge separation efficiency of TiO2-based photocatalysts were described in details in sections 2.2.4., and 2.2.5. The morphological architecture and the defect engineering tactics and their influence on the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 were highlighted in sections 2.2.6., and 2.2.7."
5,Modification techniques used to improve the efficiency of TiO2-Based photocatalysts,"2.2 Modification techniques used to improve the efficiency of TiO2-Based photocatalysts Doping has been frequently applied to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 catalysts by optimizing their optical properties by narrowing their bandgap energy. Besides, dopants have a great influence on the enhancement of the charge separation efficiency of the catalysts. The applied dopants can be classified into three categories, metals, such as transition metals, or nonmetals (like N, S, and C), and noble metals (such as Au, Pd, and Pt). Commonly, noble metals such as Au and Ag have a great ability to absorb visible light owing to the surface plasmon resonance, but they are very expensive materials, which restrict their application as efficient dopants in photocatalysis. Due to their low price and availability, the transition metals can be an alternative to the noble metals and also have the ability to enhance the photocatalytic activity. However, their leakage activity contributes to the rapid deactivation of the catalyst and produces a second source of contamination that allows dissolved metals to be removed from treated water. Hence, doping with nonmetals (mainly group P-block elements) has advantages compared to the metal dopants. Besides the effective sensitization of TiO2 toward the visible through narrowing of the bandgap energy, charge separation, cheap, abundant and environmentally-friendly materials appear as interesting landscapes. More details about these three categories of dopants materials will be explained in more detail in the following sections. 2.2.1 Metal ion doping TiO2 doping by a heteroatom is an important means of extending light absorption and influencing the band edge positions to boost the photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst. [102]. Recently, Ismael et al. [103] reviewed the effect of dopants on enhancing the hydrogen production activity of TiO2. In general, doping of transition metal cations decreases the bandgap of the semiconductor by creating an impurity energy level (donor level or acceptor level) in the forbidden band of TiO2 semiconductor making the photocatalysts visible light active (Fig. 17 a&b) [104] and may as well change the crystallinity of TiO2, resulting in the creation some lattice defects, which diminish in electron/hole recombination centers [105]. Besides, the creation of donor or acceptor level in the forbidden band of TiO2 and generation of gap state through the interaction with the TiO2 VB state, which improves the spectral response, enhanced charge separation efficiency can be also achieved through the formation of Schottky barriers formed at the semiconductor–metal interface or through the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the noble metal or metal ions. Herein, the doped metal can act as an electron sink site, trapping electrons from the CB of TiO2, indicating improved charge separation efficiency. The overall effects of metal dopants on enhanced light absorption and charge separation of TiO2 are displayed in Fig. 17c [106]. Among different metals used as dopants, copper (Cu) is the most promising metal dopant due to its availability, and superior work function [106]. However, cation doping amounts or concentrations should be carefully controlled to reach the optimum. Otherwise, in the case of high dopant concentration acts as a recombination center and may reduce the photocatalytic performance. Therefore, regulation of the appropriate amount of dopant with improved charge trapping and separation efficiency is very critical.Fig. 18. For instance, Ismael et al. [107] recently reported Ru doped TiO2 for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation, their results show that 0.1 wt% Ru is the optimum amount for the highest hydrogen activity; increase amount of the Ru shows a decrease in the hydrogen production activity. For another metal dopant, Singh et al. [108] tested iron-doped TiO2 thin film for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Doped thin films were successfully synthesized using the sol–gel spin coating method. Compared to pure TiO2, the higher activity for the obtained thin film was ascribed to the extension of light absorption toward the visible region. Sun et al. [109] successfully manufactured deposited metallic silver and nanoparticles Fe3+/TiO2 for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation through the solvothermal process. In all TiO2 tested photocatalysts, 4.5 wt% was optimum and displayed the highest hydrogen production activity. Enhanced light absorption and reduce charge recombination were responsible for its higher photocatalytic performance are shown in Fig. (18(a&b)). Dholam et al. [110] successfully fabricated Cr doped TiO2 thin film using the different concentrations of Cr and different numbers of ITO/Cr-doped-TiO2 layers via the RT magnetron sputteringmethod. Interestingly, a thin film with the highest concentration of Cr and 6 layers thickness shows the highest photocurrent and hydrogen production activity. Another work related to the same group, Dholam et al. [111] synthesized multilayer films ITO/V-doped TiO2 using the same method. 6 wt% of V with 6 layers shows the highest activity toward hydrogen production. Herein, enhanced light absorption by V ions and reduce charge carrier recombination providing by the 6 layers thickness responsible for the higher activity. Agegnehu et al. [112] hydrothermally prepared V-doped TiO2/reduced graphene nanocomposite for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. Compared to pure TiO2, nanocomposites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity due to the narrowing bandgap energy and efficient charge separation offering by the graphene sheet and the metal ion dopant. Cerium doped titania is synthesized through a facile sol–gel method was studied by Bharatvaj and his co-workers [113]. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts was assessed to produce hydrogen in the sulfide solution. 0.4 wt% Ce3+–TiO2 shows the highest activity due to the reduction in the bandgap energy. In another related study, Fan et al. [114] successfully deposited Ag nanoparticles in Fe/TiO2 nanotubes via microwave-assisted chemical reduction. Ag-Fe/TiO2 NTs showed higher visible light hydrogen production performance, which attributed to better light absorption behavior and high charge carriers separation. Cobalt also was used as a dopant metal for the photocatalytic enhancement of TiO2 activity. For instance, Sadanandam et al. [115] prepared Co/TiO2 photocatalysts by impregnation method and tested for hydrogen production employing glycerol as a sacrificial reagent. 1 wt% cobalt/TiO2 and 5% glycerol was optimum and demonstrates the highest hydrogen evolution rate. Similarly, Le et al. [116] used a simple physical absorption method to prepare effective RhB dye-sensitized Co/TiO2 material for the overall splitting of photocatalytic water under visible light. The catalyst RhB-Co/ TiO2 effectively splits water into a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen and oxygen (Fig. 19 (a-c)). Coupling effects between the dye and the doped photocatalyst is the key factor for enhancing the hydrogen production activity compared to Co/TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. 19(d)). Furthermore, other transition metals such as Ni and Cu act as dopant metals on TiO2. For instance, Jing et al. [117] successfully obtained Ni-doped mesoporous TiO2 photocatalyst. The results also indicated that the amount of hydrogen generation is strongly correlated to the concentration of Ni dopant and 1 wt% presents the highest hydrogen production activity due to the efficient charge separation and narrow bandgap energy. The bimetallic structure shows also an enhancement in photocatalytic hydrogen production. For instance, Mohamed et al. [118] studied the difference between monometallic and bimetallic doped titanium in photocatalytic action. In this analysis, the nanostructured bimetallic copper/nickel doped TiO2 photocatalytic activity was contrasted with monometallic and also with undoped photocatalysts of TiO2. The results indicated that 5% of CuNi-doped-TiO2 achieved the highest photocurrent density (Fig. 20 (a)), and photoconversion efficiency (Fig. 20(b)) that was attributed to the efficient charge separation provided by the two metal dopants. Recently, Gogoi et al. [119] used a simple chemical reduction method for the synthesis of Ag/TiO2 photocatalyst. Among different Ag-doped TiO2, 1.5Ag/TiO2 exhibited the highest activity toward hydrogen production in the presence of different sacrificial reagents (Ethanol, and a mixture of Na2S and Na2SO3). The highest activity of 1.5Ag/TiO2 could mainly be attributed to the existence of oxygen vacancies and the Ti - Ag - O phase, reduction in the bandgap energy due to surface plasmonic resonance (SPR), and efficient charge separation. In another interesting work, Zeng et al. [120] constructed a novel, unassisted, hybrid tandem photocatalytic fuel cell by adhering to a silicon solar cell to the back of a highly-active silicon-doped TiO2 nanorod array. In this study, a silicon-doped TiO2 nanorod array was hydrothermally synthesized and the hybrid tandem photocatalytic fuel cell was tested for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production from organic compound degradation under solar light irradiation. Compared to conventional fuel cells, hybrid tandem photocatalytic fuel cells have improved light absorption and charge transfer, owing to the synergistic effect between silicon solar cells and a highly-active silicon-doped TiO2 nanorod array, resulting in enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Copper is also an efficient dopant for TiO2 can increase its activity by narrowing the bandgap energy and shifting the absorption edge toward the visible region. For instance, Udayabhanu et al. [121] successfully deposited CuO on Cu-TiO2 nanoparticles not only tested for hydrogen production activity (10,453 mmol h1 g1 of the catalyst which is 21 fold higher than pure TiO2 nanoparticles in the aqueous solution containing glycerol as a sacrificial reagent), but also for the degradation of MB and photoreduction of toxic Cr6+. The results investigated that 3% mol of CuO on Cu-TiO2 nanoparticles showed the highest hydrogen production under visible and solar light irradiation (Fig. 21 a&b), which was mainly ascribed to the enhanced light absorption through narrowing the bandgap energy (Fig. 21c) and efficient charge separation (Fig. 21d). Interestingly, Park et al. [122] investigated hydrogen production from water by applying liquid plasma to the photocatalytic splitting of water over Ag-doped TiO2. The photocatalytic hydrogen production was enhanced for the doped TiO2 in the presence of methanol as an additive. The enhanced activity was attributed to the wider visible light absorption of Ag-doped TiO2 as well as to the optical generating of OH radicals and the role of methanol as an electron donor. Niobium (Nb) is one of the most promising dopants which can enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2 by modifying the surface structure and crystalline structure of TiO2 and acts as an electron sink and inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs. For that, Ravishankar et al. [123] used an ionic liquid (IL) assisted hydrothermal method for the synthesis of Nb/TiO2 nanoparticles at 140 °C in one day. Their findings showed that 0.3% Nb exhibited the highest visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity in an aqueous solution containing ethanol that may be assigned to the synergistic effect between Nb and TiO2. Besides, Mn-doped and Mo-doped TiO2 were also developed for enhanced photocatalysis [124–126]. Besides the mono-doping, co-doping (metal/metal [127] or metal/non-metal [128]) of TiO2 with two metals is also a promising method to enhance their photocatalytic activity performance through reconstruct the conduction and valence band of TiO2 simultaneously reduce the bandgap energy, suppress the charge carrier recombination and maintain the charge balance. For that, Lai et al. [129] synthesized W, N co-doped TiO2 nanobelts films via a facile method and tested for photodegradation under both UV and visible light irradiation. Their investigation showed that the nanobelts structure along with the co-doping effect assured an excellent performance of TiO2. 2.2.2 Non-metal ion doping Nonmetal ion doping (anion doping) is s novel and attractive approach for shifting light absorption of TiO2 into the visible region by an upward shift of its valence band without any effects on the CB of TiO2. Unlike metal ion or cation doping, Nonmetal ion doping cannot for an impurity energy level (donor level) in the forbidden band of the TiO2 semiconductor [130]. According to this process, the photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalysts will be improved by reducing their bandgap gap, which can only be accomplished by moving the valence band upwards (Fig. 22 ) [131]. Various nonmetal ions, such as C, N, and S were commonly used to dope TiO2. For instance, Luo et al. [132] reported that B and N dopants enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of TiO2 in the presence of oxygenated hydrocarbon and water. Similarly, Ramalingam et al. [133] compared photocatalytic hydrogen production of Pd deposited B, N-doped TiO2 photocatalyst to SrTiO3. Photocatalysts were prepared via the sol–gel method. In another study, Pd/B9/N5-doped TiO2 photocatalyst shows higher activity that may be attributed to the higher stability of the deposited-doped photocatalyst. Yuan et al. [134] successfully fabricated N-doped TiO2 by a simple heating method of the precursors. The photocatalytic activity of the doped materials was tested for hydrogen production. The results show that the phase transformation (anatase to rutile), enhanced light absorption, and enlarged surface area are responsible for higher hydrogen production. In another interesting study, Ilie et al. [135] compared the photocatalytic hydrogen production from sugar solution of TiO2/SiO2 photocatalyst modified by different metal and nonmetal elements. Results showed that non-metals present higher hydrogen production, which may be ascribed to less formation of the recombination centers compared to the metal ions. S-doped porous anatase TiO2 is synthesized through a facile thermal method by Xing and his co-workers [136]. High hydrogen production activity was obtained for the sample calcined at 700 °C that assigned to higher crystallinity, porous structure, and the role of the S atom in enhancing charge separation. Sang et al. [137] studied the efficiency of photoelectrochemical H2 evolution for the nanotubular N/C-TiO2 electrode. C doped-TiO2 showed higher activity than C-doped TiO2, which is mainly attributed to the defect state, and more negative flat band potential caused by C. Shaban et al. [138] synthesized carbon-doped TiO photoelectrodes by flame oxidation for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. This modified CM-n-TiO2 photoelectrode is capable of producing hydrogen by splitting water with a conversion efficiency of 9.02% under white light. Results show that the higher hydrogen production efficiency of CM-n-TiO2 photoelectrodes was assigned to narrow bandgap energy and create new mid-band energy provided by carbon as anion dopant. In another study, Liu et al. [139] synthesized carbonate-incorporated TiO2 microspheres via the facile solvothermal method for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production and degradation of MO, showing highly effective visible-light performance with respect to bare TiO2 that ascribed to the smaller pore size and high specific surface area. Similarly, Zhou et al. [140] demonstrated that nanostructured C doped TiO2 thin film was successfully achieved by pulsed laser deposition, presenting higher photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance and photocurrent response than bare TiO2. Owing to its stability, comparable atomic size, low ionization energy, and efficient trapping center, nitrogen was widely used as a nonmetal dopant for the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of TiO2. For instance, Babu et al. [141] prepared a rice grain morphology nitrogen-doped TiO2 and the photocatalytic activity was assessed for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. Nitrogen-doped TiO2 showed higher hydrogen production activity compared to that of pure TiO2 that may be ascribed to the efficient charge separation and a higher specific surface area of the doped photocatalyst. Wang et al. [142] mounted N-doped TiO2 film by sputtering RF reactive magnetron in a gas mixture. The reduction of N doped TiO2 bandgap energy was responsible for the enhancement of hydrogen activity relative to bare TiO2. Likewise, Wang et al. [143] deposited N-doped TiO2 film with preferred (211) orientation using the same approach, the photocatalytic activity of the deposited film was evaluated for hydrogen production. Herein, (211) facets show the highest hydrogen evolution rate. Recently, Sun et al. [144] synthesized Au/N-C/TiO2 photocatalysts by combining the pyrolysis of the Ti-containing metal–organic framework and photoreduction. The photocatalytic activity of the novel Au/N-C/TiO2 photocatalysts was tested for hydrogen production under simulated sun-light illumination for 1 h. Importantly, the composition and interface sequence of the N-doped carbon layer and Au nanoparticles were carefully engineered and showed a great influence on the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. Their findings indicated that the photocatalytic H2 production efficiency of N-C/Au/TiO2 is higher than that of Au/N-C/TiO2 due to the synergistic effect that occurred with a controlled cocatalyst interface (Fig. 23 a-c). Furthermore, the improved light absorption of Au/N-C/TiO2 photocatalyst is a second cause for the activity enhancement (Fig. 23d). Furthermore, Qin et al. [145] successfully engineered a novel CdS/Ti3+/N-TiO2 using combined evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) and hydrothermal methods. Among different synthesized photocatalysts, 10%CdS/N-TiO2 exhibited the highest activity, which ascribed to the broaden the absorption range of visible light provided by nitrogen dopant and to the reduction of the activation barriers due to the presence of Ti3+ that act as a hydrogenation shell at the interface of TiO2. Recently, 2D MXenes, consisting of transition metal cabide or nitride, have shown excellent electrical performance and have been applied in catalysts [146,147]. For instance, Kong et al [148] used a simple and low-cost route for the first time synthesis of nanolayered photocatalyst of N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and N-doped C derived from layered N-Mxene. The as-prepared N-TiO2/NC nanocomposite displayed higher activity toward hydrogen production via water splitting under visible light irradiation, which assigned to the enhanced visible light absorption and efficient charge separation ability. Sulfur ion is also used as a nonmetal dopant. For instance, Yang et al. [149] successfully constructed core–shell nanostructured S-doped rutile TiO2, the presence of sulfur on the surface of the rutile TiO2 was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 24 (a)). As a result, sulfur-doped titania boosts the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate assigned to enhance light absorption (Fig. 24(b)). In another study, Vorontsov et al. [150] showed that the doping of TiO2 anatase by substitution of Ti with cationic sulfur S6+ and S4+ is energetically unfavorable for the bulk and favorable for the surface. Their results showed that the doped TiO2 with S4+ resulted in lattice distortions comparable to that for S6+, resulting in the introduction of an uncompensated charge for neighbor Ti atoms and induce visible light absorption and visible light photocatalytic activity through narrowing the bandgap energy. Furthermore, plots of frontier orbitals for S4+-doped nanoparticle presented that holes and electrons have distinctly different localizations which mean effective separation of photogenerated charges and expected small rate of recombination. Moreover, their findings showed that structural effects have a profound influence on photocatalytic properties of S-doped TiO2. Fluorine anion was also used in the literature as a dopant for the improvement of hydrogen production activity of TiO2 [151]. Furthermore, Liu et al. [152] also stated that good bandgap narrowing, better distribution, and valence band elevation can only be accomplished if the anion has less electronegativity than oxygen. 2.2.3 Noble metal/ cocatalyst loading Various metal nanoparticles or cocatalysts, such as Pt [153], Pd [154], Au [155], Cu [156], Rh, Ru [157] and Ag [158] are very active cocatalysts for improving TiO2 photocatalysts by suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Noble metals are commonly used as cocatalysts have lower Fermi energy levels than that of TiO2. Thus, when they were loaded onto the surface of the TiO2 photocatalyst either by situ photodeposition or impregnation method, the Schottky barrier can be formed at the interface between the two (Fig. 25 (a)) [159,160]. The photogenerated electrons are therefore passed through the Schottky barrier to the host photocatalysts surface and captured by the cocatalyst, which serves as a hydrogen evolution site. (Fig. 25(b)) [161]. Thus, electrons are efficiently separated from the VB holes, resulting in improving hydrogen evolution activity. Furthermore, the work function of the metal plays a key role in controlling the electron-hole separation [162]. Additionally, when noble metal such as Au and Ag are decorated on the surface of TiO2, there is an additional effect, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which contributes to a strong absorption of the visible light and thus enhanced the photocatalytic performance under the visible light illumination [163]. However, noble metals like gold (Au) and platinum (Pt) are the most widely studied dopants for TiO2, owing to their superior work function [106]. Recently, Beasley et al. [164] studied the influence of the work function of the common noble/metal ions on the photocatalytic hydrogen production over TiO2. Their findings investigated that the hydrogen production activity is strongly correlated to the work function of the metal ion and increased with the increasing the work function of the metals. Different metals were used in this study such as Pt, Pd, Cu, Ru, and Ag with their work functions are 5.93, 5.60, 5.10, 4.71, and 4.26 eV, respectively. Pt/TiO2 showed the highest activity for hydrogen generation from water due to its larger work function and upward-bent band causing the photoelectrons to be trapped in those metal sites that are eventually consumed during water reduction, therefore, enhance the charge separation efficiency. Whereas, other metals such as Ag, Ru, and Cu were less effective towards hydrogen production due to downward-bent band gaps that allow the photoelectrons to return to TiO2 from the metal which leads to faster charge recombination. Generally, the enhanced photocatalytic of TiO2 due to the presence of these cocatalysts can be attributed to the role of the cocatalyst in trapping electrons and thereafter enhanced the charge separation, surface plasma resonance effect of the metal, creation of the new energy levels, and generation of gap state due to the interaction between these metals and the VB of TiO2. For instance, Yu et al. [165] hydrothermally synthesized Pt deposited on TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets for hydrogen production in ethanol solution using as a sacrificial reagent to trap holes. 2 wt% of loaded Pt nanoparticles displayed the highest photocatalytic activity that may be ascribed to the efficient charge separation provided by the cocatalyst. In another study related to the same cocatalyst, Zhu et al. [166] used the simple sol–gel method to successfully grow Pt deposited TiO2 hollow sphere. 1 wt% Pt charged TiO2 was optimum and demonstrated the highest production rate of hydrogen and long-term stability. In another study, Sosa et al. [167] synthesized a series of Pt doped mesoporous titania using the sol–gel technique employingPluronic F127triblock-copolymer. 2.50 wt% was optimum and shows the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, due to the efficient charge separation and narrowing the bandgap energy. Sun et al. [168] successfully synthesized different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol PEG-modifiedTiO2 photocatalyst via the sol–gel method. Among different synthesized photocatalysts, Pt/PEG6000-TiO2 demonstrated the highest hydrogen production activity that may be assigned to the large surface area and efficient charge separation providing by PEG and Pt nanoparticles, respectively. Tristantini et al. [169] studied the role of nitrogen and platinum as dopants in enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production over anatase TiO2 nanotubes in the presence of glycerol. The photocatalytic activity of Pt-N-TiO2 was 13 times higher than the bare P25, which ascribed to the role of Pt to stabilize N in the crystal lattice of TiO2 by minimizing N leaching into solution. Furthermore, Pt nanoparticles can also trap electrons and enhance the charge separation efficiency of N-TiO2. Yang et al. [170] reported that both Pd/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 anatase photocatalysts have higher activities toward hydrogen production in the presence of ethanol than Rh/TiO2, which ascribed to the poor contact between the metal particle (Rh) and the titanium oxide support. Furthermore, the formation of the surface ethoxide and hydroxyl formed by dissociative adsorption at the interface between the Pt (or Pd) metal particles and TiO2. Thus electrons of metal ion reduce the hydrogen atom in the hydroxyl, in the meantime, ethoxide species acts as a hole scavenger, resulting in enhancing the charge separation of the photocatalytic and improving the photocatalytic performance. Pd as a cocatalyst can also enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of TiO2. For instance, Ye et al. [171] sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays by palladium quantum dots. Compared with undoped TiO2, the photocatalytic activity of Pd/TiO2 was sharply enhanced toward the production of hydrogen, which may be attributed to the smooth charge separation provided by the coupling effect between TiO2 nanotubes and Pd quantum dots. Au as a noble metal cocatalyst was also reported in the literature as a promising metal in enhancing the hydrogen evolution activity of TiO2. Priebe et al. [172] stated that the increased activity in the production of hydrogen in an aqueous methanol solution of Au deposited TiO2 catalysts depended on the formation of plasmonic Au particles and the efficiency of Au cocatalyst charge separation. Furthermore, Ortiz et al. [173] compared the photocatalytic activities of undoped and doped TiO2 synthesized via two different methods. The photocatalyst sample prepared by the sol–gel/solvothermal/thermal exhibited the highest activity for hydrogen evolution for 4 h was ascribed to the reduction of the bandgap energy (Fig. 26 (a&b)) and enlarged the specific surface area (Fig. 26(c&d)). Although noble metals modified TiO2 are particularly stable under light irradiation and effective for H2 production, however, due to their high price, alternative low-cost transition metal cocatalysts have to be investigated [174]. Ag2O also could be used as a cocatalyst. For instance, Lalitha et al. [175] successfully deposited Ag ion on TiO2 using the impregnation method. Among the different amounts of Ag loading, 0.5 wt% shows the highest hydrogen evolution activity in an aqueous solution containing methanol. Herein, Ag deposited on the surface of TiO2 plays an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity. However, metallic Ag usually shows a far low H2-evolution rate due to its serious capacitive property and poor H2-evolution activity for Ag-modified photocatalysts compared to the common noble cocatalyst like Pt. For that, Gao et al [176] boosted the photocatalytic hydrogen activity performance of Ag by generating core–shell Ag@Ni cocatalysts. All the as-synthesized Ag@Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts displayed a markedly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate, which attributes to the presence of both Ag and Ni metals, which act as an electron sink and interfacial active hydrogen site, respectively. In another study, Wu et al. [177] synthesized Ag/TiO2 NTs(NTs: nanotubes) photocatalysts using the microwave-assisted chemical reduction method and tested their activities for hydrogen production. Their results revealed that the Ag/TiO2 NTsexhibited 3.3 times higher than pure TiO2, which mainly attributed to the surface plasma resonance effect of Ag metals and the role of Ag nanoparticles in restraining the charge recombination. Copper nanoparticles are also could be used as an alternative to the expensive noble metals-based systems due to their availability, cheap, and narrow bandgap energies (1.4–2.3 eV) [178,179]. Ravi et al. [180] synthesized CuO@NiO core–shell structures used a chemical reduction method. This novel cocatalyst was deposited over TiO2 nanoparticles to enhance hydrogen production generation. Among differently prepared photocatalysts, CNO1-10 T (10% wt TiO2) presented the highest activity (Fig. 27 (a&b)). Enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was attributed to improved light absorption (Fig. 27c). Additionally, this novel photocatalyst showed obvious stability after 3 days (Fig. 27d). In another related study, Wang et al. [181] decorated CuO quantum dots on TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets using the hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated for hydrogen production in the presence of methanol under light irradiation. 5% CuO/TiO2 showed the highest activity (Fig. 28 a), which attributed to the efficient charge-separated revealed by the transient photocurrent measurements (Fig. 28b), and improved charge absorption (Fig. 28c) caused by the reduction in the bandgap energy (Fig. 28d). The work of Wu et al. [182], for example, preferentially demonstrated that the impregnation/calcination method was successfully applied to prepare Cu nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2. Results showed that Cu can facilitate the charge transfer, thereafter, enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2. Kumar et al. [183] illustrated that the improvement in the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of CuO/ TiO2 is due to the quantum size of CuO and increased photo-excited electrons and hole separation efficiency. This charge separation improvement was attributed to the formation of Cu2O, which facilitates the interfacial electron transfer to generate hydrogen. Similarly, Nie et al. [184] fabricated Cu/TiO2 as a highly efficient visible-light photocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Enhanced hydrogen production activity was mainly attributed to the Cu-SPR effect. The electrons generated from TiO2 upon illumination can easily reduce the Cu2+/Cu+ species to Cu0, which in turn promotes more electron-hole pair generation. Furthermore, copper nanoparticles act as a cocatalyst to trap the generated electron from TiO2 and transfer them to the protons for more hydrogen generation. Enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2 by grafting of Cu2S on its surface is documented by Guan et al. [185]. Herein, the photocatalytic activity of Cu2S/ TiO2 was greatly enhanced compared to bare TiO2, which ascribed to the visible light absorption property of Cu2S, efficient charge separation and transfer provided by the formation of the interfacial Schottky barrier, and the ability of Cu2S in lowing the activation energy or overpotential for the proton reduction. It was demonstrated by Yoong et al. [186] that copper doping onto TiO2 semiconductor photocatalyst has enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2. Different amount of the dopant loading varied from 2 to 15% was synthesized via combined calcination and wet impregnation methods. Among the different amounts of Cu dopants, 10 wt% Cu/TiO2 calcined at 300 °C showed the highest hydrogen production activity in the presence of methanol as an electron scavenger. Reduction of the bandgap energy of TiO2 and improving the charge separation performance due to the presence of Cu ions are believed to be responsible for enhanced the photocatalytic performance. Xu et al. [187] also studied the effect using different synthesis methods on the production of hydrogen over Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts. Among the four different synthesis methods used in the study, the sol–gel method exhibited the highest activity even more than the Pt/Au loaded TiO2 that ascribed to the high stability and efficiency, low-cost and high stability. Furthermore, this study showed that the distribution of Cu over TiO2 and the chemical states of Cu are strongly affected by the applied synthesis method. Active and cheap Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts were synthesized by the photodeposition of Cu on the surface of TiO2 supports was documented by Montini et al. [188]. Importantly, the photocatalytic activity of Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts is strongly dependent on the TiO2 supports. Two types of supports were used in the study; titanium isopropoxide and titanyl sulfate. Interestingly, a sample containing 2.5 wt% Cu and prepared from titanium isopropoxide support TiO2 exhibited the highest activity. This could be ascribed to the longer lifetime of the electron/hole pair of multiphasic TiO2 materials. Table 1 listed various doped TiO2-based photocatalysts and their photocatalytic hydrogen activity performance. 2.2.4 Semiconductors combination The semiconductor combination between TiO2 and other semiconductors to construct a heterojunction structure is another significant technique to harness visible solar radiations by reducing the bandgap energy and promote charge separation for enhancing hydrogen evolution. [209], in principle, when the semiconductor photocatalyst with a higher conduction band is combined with the semiconductor having a lower valence band, electrons are moved from the higher CB semiconductor (semiconductor I) to the lower VB semiconductor photocatalyst (semiconductor 2), while photogenerated holes migrate in the opposite direction. This way of charge separation is called type II heterojunction and is the most typical heterojunction system used for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 to produce hydrogen. Therefore, effective charge separation is observed as shown in Fig. 29 [210]. Besides, type II heterojunction, the holes and electrons transfer in the type I heterojunction in one direction; from semiconductor 1 to 2, leading to accumulation of the charge carriers in one semiconductor (B), which is negative for e-/h+ separation. Due to the mismatching between the band positions of the two semiconductors, as a result, there is no charge transfer and separation of electrons and holes between the two semiconductors that usually happened in the type (III) heterojunction. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a robust metal-free photocatalyst has been widely used as a promising candidate for different applications in photocatalysis [211–215]. Ismael et al. [216] recently reviewed several applications of g-C3N4 in photocatalysis. Due to its suitable band position (CB and VB position), it is considered to be a promising candidate for the heterostructure composite formation with TiO2. Recently, Lv et al. [217] in their work – a 3D camellia-like NH4TiOF3/TiO2/g-C3N4 heterostructure was constructed by a convenient method with higher photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. They observed that there was a great deal of enhancement in the hydrogen production, which is ascribed to the multiple refractions and reflections of light within the catalyst, which greatly improved the efficiency of light absorption. Furthermore, the coupling of NH4TiOF3 and TiO2 also effectually reduced the electron-hole recombination in the g-C3N4. Ti3+ self-doping black TiO2/g-C3N4 hollow core–shell nano-heterojunction was reported by Pan et al. [218]. The nano-heterostructure was synthesized using the hydrothermal method and tested for hydrogen production. Enhanced photocatalytic activity of B-TiO2/g-C3N4 nano-heterojunctions was attributed to the efficient charge separation revealed by the transient photocurrent, PL, EIS experiments. Nasir et al. [219] prepared a 1D branched TiO2 loaded Au/g-C3N4 QDs hybrid and analyzed its photocatalytic hydrogen activity under visible light. Authors found that the hybrid exhibits an obvious activity owing to the efficient charge separation and improved light absorption offered by the type II heterostructure system and the presence of plasmonic Au, respectively. Likewise, Nasir et al. [220] synthesized the same hybrid without loading of Au over g-C3N4 quantum dots. The activity was enhanced compared to the pure TiO2 or g-C3N4 but less than that with Au nanoparticles, confirming the role of Au in enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Geng et al. [221] noted that the construction of Ag/TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunction nanocomposite by self-assembly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. The higher activity of the nanocomposite is due to the formation of the active site through the coordination of Ag+ ions with the g-C3N4 and the distribution of the TiO2 nanoparticles forming the heterostructure. Moreover, Chai et al. [222] synthesized (g-C3N4)-Pt-TiO2, showing highly effective visible-light hydrogen production activity performance for bare g-C3N4 and TiO2. A well-aligned band position for the formation of the heterostructure together with the role of Pt in enhancing charge separation is responsible for the enhancing activity of the composite. In another study, Yan et al. [223] reported the synthesis of visible-light TiO2-g-C3N4 composite material for hydrogen production activity in aqueous methanol solution using a sacrificial reagent. The improved composite activity has been allocated to improve the absorption of visible light. Recently, Ramos et al. [224] prepared type II g-C3N4 coupled TiO2 heterojunction photocatalyst using the hydrothermal method. The highest hydrogen production activity was achieved with the heterojunction structure containing a high amount of TiO2 (1:4). The higher activity of the composite compared to that of pure g-C3N4 or TiO2 is assigned to the reduced bandgap energy, large pore size, enhanced charge separation, and suitable band positions of both semiconductors forming the composite. Similarly, Cheng et al. [225] prepared TiO2 graphene nanocomposite by the solvothermal reaction, followed by a remarkable increase in photocatalytic efficiency in hydrogen production using CH3OH as an electron donor and Pt as a cocatalyst (Fig. 30 (a)) 10 wt% GR-P25 was the optimum and presents the highest activity, which attributed to the light absorption enhancement ability and charges separation efficiency confirmed by the photoluminescence and the UV–Vis and experiments, respectively (Fig. 30(b-d)). Likewise, Zeng et al. [226] hydrothermally constructed graphite oxide (GO)-TiO2 nanocomposite for H2 production at the light of λ ≥ 420 nm irradiation and 2 wt% GO-TiO2 exhibited the highest activity. Shifting the light absorption into the high wavelength region is believed to be the responsible factor for enhancing hydrogen production activity. Interestingly, Corredor et al. [227] synthesized rGO/TiO2 composites with different ratios of reduced graphene oxide and tested them toward hydrogen evolution in the presence of methanol. Their study compared the photocatalytic activity of pure TiO2 and 2% rGO. Importantly, they showed that applying argon in removing hydrogen from the reaction mixture has shown effective in recovering the hydrogen generation rate over TiO2 for long operation times, while rGO is reduced due to the increase in the defects in its structure. A novel PANITiO2/rGO photocatalysts (PANI: polymerized aniline) was synthesized by the ultrasonic method reported by Ma et al. [228]. PANITiO2/rGO photocatalyst exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen activity compared to that of TiO2/rGO and pure TiO2 photocatalysts (Fig. 31 a&b). Furthermore, Enhanced activity was attributed to the enhanced light absorption and the reduction of the bandgap energy (Fig. 31c&d). Besides the π conjugated structure of graphite and graphene, other oxides and sulfides with suitable redox potential can combine with TiO2. For instance, Miwa et al. [229] prepared various primary oxide binding nanocomposites TiO2, such as ZnO, SnO2, CuO, Al2O3, and CuO/Al2O3/TiO2, using a hybrid high-temperature mixing/solid-state reaction process. Results indicated that ternary composite displayed higher activity than binary composite, and 0.2 wt% CuO/0.3 wt% Al2O3/TiO2 received the highest activity. Due to their ability to harvest visible light, Bi-based semiconductors are widely studied in photocatalytic water splitting. Among them, BiYO3 was widely owing to the suitable bandgap energy (2.6 eV) that can utilize visible light [230]. Nevertheless, as a single semiconductor, BiYO3 has some limitations in practical applications in photocatalysis, such as efficiency of charge transport and light absorption capacity. For that reason, Qin et al [231] recently synthesized TiO2/BiYO3 photocatalysts by a facile sol–gel method. Charge separation efficiency provides by type I heterostructure between the two semiconductors is responsible for the enhancement of its photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. In another study, Zhao et al. [232] reviewed TiO2/CdS nanocomposites with different microstructures for different applications in photocatalysis and photovoltaics. Alenzi et al. [233] decorated Ag+ nanoparticles over TiO2 to form Ag/TiO2 film for hydrogen production in the presence of methanol. This study clearly showed that the hydrogen production activity is enhanced in the presence of silver ions, which is related to the efficient charge separation. Similarly, Zhao et al. [234] compared two synthesis methods used for the preparation of Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite. Interestingly, photocatalyst prepared by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis shows higher photocatalytic hydrogen production and CO2 photoreduction than that prepared by the wet impregnation method. Authors claim that better distribution of the silver ion and large surface area of the nanocomposite synthesized by the second route is responsible for high activity enhancement. Yu et al. [235] successfully fabricated CuO/CF/TiO2 nanocomposite using combined impregnation and calcination approaches. Among different weight ratios of carbon fiber used, 1 wt% shows the highest activity that may be ascribed to the decrease charge recombination. She et al. [236] modified TiO2 nanosheets by Cu(OH)2 and their activities was evaluated for hydrogen production. 2% Cu(OH)2 was optimum and reaches the highest activity. This remarkable enhancement in activity was attributed to the efficient charge separation offered by the composite formation. In another study, Pei et al. [237] prepared an N-doped TiO2/graphene nanocomposite for the determination of hydrogen activity. Results indicated that nanocomposites exhibited higher activity due to the decrease in bandgap energy and suitable band matching between the two semiconductors lead to smooth charge transfer and separation. With MWCNT-TiO2 composites loaded with different contents of CNT, Reddy, and co-workers [238] studied their hydrogen production performance in glycerol aqueous solutions. 0.1 wt% CNTpresented the highest activity due to the enhancement of light absorption efficiency. The AgIn5S8/TiO2 composite photocatalysts were studied by Li and co-workers [239] for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. Encouragingly, the resulting g- AgIn5S8/TiO2 heterojunctions prepared by the ultrasonic-deposition method showed higher activity than that prepared via the hydrothermal method. This superior activity may be ascribed to the better dispersion of AgIn5S8 over TiO2. Moreover, Yermokhina and his group [240] systematically studied the mesoporous Ni/TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalyst for improved H2 evolution. Results demonstrated that doped materials showed higher photocatalytic activity than that of pure TiO2, which is attributed to the high surface area. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with a narrow bandgap energy of ∼ 1.29 eV is considered as a promising catalyst to extend the sunlight absorption range and improve hydrogen production activity by edge S - Mo - S active sites [241]. Liu et al. [242] proposed that eosin-sensitized Au/Cu nanoalloy/TiO2/MoS2 ternary hybrid led to high quantum efficiency for photocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen. This remarkable improvement is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the Au/Cu nanoalloy and TiO2/MoS2, which facilitate the charge separation and improve the light absorption efficiency. Afanasiev and co-workers [243] combined MoS2 “inorganic fullerenes” with high surface area TiO2 to achieve enhanced hydrogen generation rate in water-methanol slurries. Interestingly, Enhanced hydrogen production MoS2 inorganic fullerenes/TiO2 composite was mainly ascribed to the transfer of long-live photogenerated stored electrons (accumulated) electrons from the TiO2 to MoS2 inorganic fullerenes, the contact between the MoS2 and TiO2, and excellent dispersibility of MoS2/ inorganic fullerenes and stability of its colloidal suspensions in water-methanol mixtures. Anatase/Rutile biphasic TiO2 nanoparticles@MoS2 nanosheets heterojunctions were reported by Zhong et al. [244]. Photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction was assessed for hydrogen production under solar irradiation. Effective charge separation between the titania phases as well as between them and the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles@MoS2 nanosheets heterojunctions was responsible for the photoactivity enhancement of the system. Other semiconductors with an appropriate band position could be considered as promising candidates to couple with TiO2, such as Fe2O3 [245], Bi2O3 [246], and In2S3 [247]. The composite formation between the semiconductors was reported to play a key role in the inhibition of the charge recombination rate. Nonetheless, this technique has some drawbacks, such as photocorrosion in the aqueous phase of some composite-forming semiconductors affecting their stability [248,249] and also finding suitable couples of semiconductors with band alignment to facilitate the separation of the charge carrier. Table 2 listed different TiO2-based photocatalysts and its composites with different morphology and photocatalytic hydrogen activity performance. 2.2.5 Dyes sensitization Besides metal and nonmetal ion doping, noble metal loading, and composite formation, dye sensitization is another significant technique to harvest visible solar radiations for enhancing hydrogen evolution. Several dyes such as safranine and others are considered to be promising candidates for visible light sensitivity. Fig. 32 shows the most common dyes used to sensitize TiO2. They can be successfully utilized in solar cells as well as photocatalytic systems to sensitize TiO2. According to this method, electrons were injected from the excited dyes that adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2 to the CB of TiO2, where they were used to reduce water and produce hydrogen as illustrated in Fig. 33 [274]. For instance, Jin et al. [275] sensitized that eosin dye CuO incorporated a TiO2 catalyst for photocatalytichydrogen production at light irradiation of λ > 420 nm in the presence of different electron donors. Enhance photocatalytic activity of the sensitized photocatalyst was ascribed to efficient electron immigration between the dye molecule and the composite. Ru-complexes are the most popular used dyes in photosensitive TiO2 owing to the suitable energy bandgap and absorption, excellent stability in aqueous solutions, and relatively high efficiency [276]. For instance, Zhang et al. [277] achieved highly visible-light photocatalytic hydrogenproduction over a TiO2 system sensitized by binuclear RuII bipyridyl (bpy) complex [Ru2(bpy)4(BL)](ClO4)2 (BL = bridging ligand) without using cocatalyst, accompanied by a remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic capability and stability in hydrogen production. Abe et al. [278] evaluated sensitized visible-light Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts over different dye for H2 production from a water-acetonitrile containing iodide. Decreased bandgap energy and charge transfer between Pt/TiO2 and dye are believed to be responsible for the higher hydrogen production activity of the sensitized photocatalyst. Likewise, Park et al. [279] sensitized Pt/TiO2 with Ru(bpy)3 2+ without anchoring groups in the presence of different anions. PO4 3– was most efficient and facilitated stable H2 production. This could be attributed to the role of PO4 3– in changing the charge of platinized TiO2 under the acidic condition from positive to negative, which allowed the Ru(bpy)3 2+ to adsorb to the surface of Pt/TiO2, facilitating electron transfer from the photosensitizer to the conduction of TiO2. Nevertheless, Ru-complexes are expensive materials, toxic restrict their widespread practical application. Therefore, looking for novel metal-free organic dyes that could extend the light absorption to the NIR region is crucial for improving the H2 production activity of dye-sensitized TiO2. Recently, Ding et al. [280] sensitized platinized TiO2 with two indeno[1,2–b]thiophene-based organic sensitizers to significantly enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production by extending the spectral response to the near-infrared-light region. Results indicated that S5@Pt/TiO2 blue dyes (S5: D-A-π-A: donor–acceptor-π-acceptor) exhibited higher photocatalytic hydrogen activity than S6@Pt/TiO2 (S6: D-π-A). 2, 3-diphenylquinoxaline of S5 has great influence in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of S5 due to disperse donor electron, improve stability, and enhance the light absorption. Correspondingly, Lai et al. [281] used multicarbazole-based organic dyes to sanitize Pt/TiO2 for the determination of hydrogen production activity under visible light irradiation. Authors have synthesized three different multicarbazole-based organic dyes named 2C, 3C, and 4C according to the amount of the dyes used. They investigated that 3C@Pt/TiO2 revealed the highest activity for 3 h irradiation. After 3 h irradiation, the activity was decreased due to the removal of electron acceptor cyanoacrylate moiety from the multicarbazole-based organic dyes molecule during the photocatalytic process. Also, there are numerous ways used to attach dyes with semiconductor surfaces, such as electrostatic interaction, hydrogen, and covalent bonding, and many more. Among them, electrostatic interactions are more effective in the improved photosensitization process [282]. For instance, Choi et al. [283] explored the applicability of visible-light organic dye-sensitized TiO2 particles in the production of hydrogen and the degradation of organic pollutants. Anchoring groups and electron donors have a great effect on hydrogen production activity. Porphyrin and their metallic derivatives with conjugate structure have gained more attention due to their intense and efficient light absorption ability in the panchromatic region, strong S and Q-band, electron transfer ability, high fluorescence, thermal and chemical stability, and appropriate energy levels for the photosensitization of different semiconductors. Therefore, they have been widely applied in the field of dye-sensitized semiconductors for red/near-IR-light persuaded H2 production and DSSCs [284]. Moreover, Due to its unique macrocycle structure, the photo-electronic properties can be easily modified by introducing diverse metal ions. Thus, porphyrins are considered to be suitable candidates for designing functional nanomaterials. The study of Banerjee et al. [285] indicated that the hydrogen production activity of porphyrin-based porous polymer and their composites, which were synthesized using the ball-milling method, was better than the parent precursor under the exposure of visible light. Their results showed that the highest activity was ascribed to the role of porphyrin in enlarging the surface area and promoting the charge separation efficiency. Liu et al. [286] tested a series of Sn-porphyrins with different functional groups and Pt nanoparticles as a sensitizer for Pt/TiO2 and tested for the H2 evolution activities. Enhanced the photocatalytic activity of Sn-porphyrins sensitized Pt/TiO2 was assigned to the synergetic effect between the sensitized TiO2 and the Q-band of Sn-porphyrins. Interestingly, Gonuguntla and co-workers [287] sensitized TiO2 photocatalyst with a panchromatic Zinc-porphyrin sensitizer and checked for hydrogen production in the presence of TEOA or glycerol as sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation. They have observed that the highest activity of Zinc-porphyrin sensitized TiO2 is due to the effective charge transfer from porphyrin to the CB of TiO2. Recently, Huang et al. [288] prepared meso-tetra(4-hydroxyphenyl) porphyrins sensitized TiO2 by the sol–gel method. The photocatalytic activity was greatly influenced by changing the central metal ions of the porphyrin ring and the Pt/meso-tetra(4-hydroxyphenyl) porphyrins -Pd-TiO2 exhibits the highest activity. The authors claimed that high surface area and efficient charge separation were responsible for enhanced the photocatalytic performance. Moreover, zinc-5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10, 15, 20-tri (3-pyridyl) porphyrin) sensitized Pt/g-C3N4 reported by Wang et al. [289] generates an apparent quantum yield of hydrogen up to 25.1% under visible light irradiation, which ascribed to the efficient charge separation between the sensitizer and the g-C3N4. Kim et al [290] successfully produced hydrogenunder visible light irradiation in atin (Sn) porphyrin(P)-sensitized TiO2 system in the pH range of 3–11.The special structure of porphyrin and its connection with tin facilitate the electron injection process to TiO2. Lee et al. [291] studied the effect of Pt/TiO2 grafted in visible light irradiation by dyes R-groups (hydrophilic or hydrophobic). The results showed that moderately hydrophilic R-anchoring groups exhibited greater sensitization activity than hydrophobic (Fig. 34 ). However, instability because of light or thermal degradation of dye molecules and the formation of intermediates during the reactions has been reported as major drawbacks associated with dye sensitization [292,293]. 2.2.6 Modification of the morphological architecture of TiO2 Enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-based semiconductors could be also achieved through the synthesis of TiO2 with specific morphology. Fig. 35 summarizes the most common morphological architecture of TiO2, which they have great influence on enhancing the photocatalytic activity [294–299]. For example, mesoporous titania (TiO2) seems to be the most promising candidate as a highly photocatalytically active photocatalyst because it has a high surface-to-volume ratio and offers more active sites at the surface of the photocatalyst to initiate the redox reaction, unique electronic structures, excellent ability for light absorption, and sufficient electron transport properties [300]. For instance, Huang et al. [301] fabricated mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers by a facile vapothermal-assisted topochemical transformation of preformed H-titanate nanobelts. It was found that the hydrogen production activity was 2 times higher than that of P25. The oriented alignment, suitable mesoporosity, high surface area, and efficient charge separation are crucial in enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Rusinque et al. [302] synthesized Pd-doped mesoporous TiO2 by the sol–gel method. Among differently doped Pd photocatalysts, 0.25 wt% Pd-TiO2 exhibits the best activity under visible light in the presence of ethanol as a scavenger. Hence, apart from the high surface area, porosity reduction of bandgap energy, the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs is another factor responsible for high photoactivity. Guan et al. [303] obtained a novel oxygen vacancy and S-doped hetero-nanostructured TiO2/Cu2S photocatalyst by NaBH4 reducing Cu doped TiO2 using a sol–gel method. Importantly, this novel hetero-nanostructured photocatalyst exhibits improved H2 generation rate from an aqueous solution containing 0.35 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 without noble metal. This markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the efficient charge separation provided by the formation of the composition system, and extend the light absorption range. Furthermore, mesoporous materials possess a versatile defective structure as well as a large exposed surface, which are particularly important in photocatalysis [304]. It has been reported that mesoporous materials with pore size in nanoscale can provide a surface defect for photocatalytic surface reaction, ensuring good accessibility during photocatalytic [305]. These defects should carefully control because excess defects could reduce photocatalytic activity [306]. Thus, excess defects site should be removed to develop an efficient defect site for charge separation enhancement. In this regard, Li et al. [307] carefully controlled the concentration of defects (lattice distortion or point effect) by improving the crystallinity of mesoporous-structured anatase TiO2, resulting in increasing the charge transfer resistance, which is unfavorable for the photocatalytic performance. The photocatalytic hydrogen production was enhanced by the introduction of Ti3+ atomic defect, which plays a key role in enhancing the charge separation as well as the hydrogen generation. Additionally, Due to their high surface-to-volume ratios, efficient charge transport and separation, and enhanced light harvesting, nanorods as 1D nanostructure are widely used in photocatalytic applications [308]. Recently, Bashiri et al. [309] decorated Fe2O3 on the surface of one-dimensional TiO2 nanorods for the determination of photoelectrochemical hydrogen activity. Enhanced hydrogen evolution activity, as well as the photocurrent density of the 1D TiO2@Fe2O3 nanorods photocatalyst, is due to the low charge transfer resistance, long lifetime of the electrons, and negative flat band potential, which they proofed using EIS, and Mott-Schottky plots, respectively. Moreover, the authors claimed that increasing the hydrothermal time up to 24 h can improve the crystal growth of titania and the length of the nanorods. Similarly, Bashiri et al. [310] decorated TiO2 nanorods with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using the hydrothermal method for the determination of hydrogen production in the photoelectrochemical cell (PEC). A maximum hydrogen activity of 1200 mmol/cm2 of TiO2nanorod@rGO compared to that of TiO2@rGO is attributed to the synergistic effect between the two phases of titania (anatase and rutile), the high surface area of TiO2 nanorods, and the high electron mobility of rGO. Zeng et al. [311] constructed a novel hybrid tandem photocatalytic fuel cell by attaching a silicon solar cell to the back of a silicon-doped TiO2 nanorod array for the determination of hydrogen production coupled with organic pollutants degradation. Enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of the silicon-doped TiO2 nanorod array was attributed to improving charge transport efficiency, which proofed by The EIS and IMPS experiments. Chen et al. [312] use a photodeposition method to decorate Co on TiO2 nanorods to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. The 2.0 wt% Co/TiO2 nanorods photocatalyst exhibits the highest activity, which can be attributed to the role of Co metal in reducing the H2 overpotential as well as in facilitating the charge separation efficiency. In another study, Huang et al. [313] prepared Rh/Nb codoped anatase TiO2 nanorods by a sol–gel-hydrothermal and solid-state phase transformation method using Ti(OC4H9)4, RhCl3·3H2O, and NbCl5 as precursors for determination of hydrogen production. The Rh/Nb codoped anatase TiO2 nanorods (Ti0.996Nb0.002Rh0.002O2) showed an obvious increased in the hydrogen production activity in methanol solution (7.85 mmol g-1h−1) (Fig. 36 a), and pure water (0.99 mmol g-1h−1) (Fig. 36b) under simulated sunlight, far higher than that for pure TiO2 nanorods and Pt-loaded P25, respectively. This higher activity was mainly attributed to the improved visible light absorption and efficient charge separation as shown in Fig. 36c&d, respectively. Importantly, Enhanced charge separation efficiency due to the presence of Nb that introduces an extra electron into Rh-doped TiO2, which maintains the charge compensation, suppresses oxygen vacancies, and avoids Rh4+ species. Furthermore, this study showed that the presence of Nb shifts the CB edge of Rh-doped TiO2 toward vacuum energy, make them thermodynamically satisfied for the water reduction reaction. Other micro-nano structures such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanosheets, can improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by providing sufficient specific surface area for increasing the photocatalytic active sites [314]. Ou et al. [315] fabricated 2D ultrathin MoS2-modified black Ti3+-TiO2 nanotubes using an electrospinning–hydrothermal treatment–reduction method. The obtained nanotubes photocatalyst was tested for hydrogen evolution reaction and exhibited 15 times higher than that of bare TiO2 nanotubes, which recognized the role of 2D MoS2 in enhancing the electron diffusion and a unique structure of MoS2/Ti3+–TiO2 nanotubes. In another work, Tian et al. [316] synthesized mesoporous carbonate-incorporated phase-junction TiO2 nanotubes by olive oil-assisted electrospinning. The outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen production performance (6108 μmol h−1 g -1), which is about 6 times higher than that of the commercially available P25, was endorsed to the enhanced light absorption and charge separation due to the refined porous structure and the presence of double phase (anatase–rutile) of TiO2, respectively. Reddy et al. [317] prepared reduced graphene oxide and TiO2 nanotubes composites photocatalysts by a hydrothermal method. The optimized 5rGO-TiO2 showed higher capacitance (160F/g specific capacitance), and also higher hydrogen production (24,880 μmol/g/h) under natural sunlight. This remarkable activity is due to the accelerated separation of electron-hole pairs and inhibited their recombination. Gao et al. [318] synthesized Bi/Bi2MoO6/TiO2 nanotubes photocatalysts using the solvothermal method and tested not only for hydrogen production activity but also for degradation of organic dyes and removal of Cr (VI) metal ion. The highest hydrogen production rate reached 173.41 μmol·h−1.cm−2. The synergistic effect between Bi2MoO6 and TiO2 nanotubes is responsible for the charge separation enhancement. Moreover, the surface plasmon resonance effect of Bi also has a great influence on enhanced photocatalytic performance. Pan et al. [319] prepared the Z-scheme CdS quantum dots/Ni2P/Black Ti3+-TiO2 nanotubes through the growing of 2D Ni2P lamellas on the surface of TiO2 nanotubes. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained photocatalyst was evaluated for hydrogen production. A noticeable enhancement of around 3303.85 μmol/g h of H2 was mainly ascribed to the role of 2D Ni2P and Ti3+ in facilitating the electron diffusion, Z-scheme mechanisms in enhancing the charge separation efficiency, and improving light absorption and utilization through the formation of nanotubes structure and oxygen vacancy. Furthermore, the fabrication of TiO2 hollow-sphere has been extensively reported as an effective way to enhance its photocatalytic activity because it can offer large specific surface areas and improve the light scattering properties of TiO2 [320]. For instance, Jiang et al. [321] boosted the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 hollow sphere for hydrogen production under solar light irradiation by dual cocatalysts (Ag and RuO2). Their findings revealed that hydrogen production was enhanced due to the spatial charge separation offered by the presence of the two cocatalysts. Recently, Seadira et al. [322] loaded different metal ions on nanostructured TiO2 hollow spheres to enhance their hydrogen production activity in the presence of glycerol. Among different metal ions loaded, Cu showed the highest activity, which was assigned to the enlarged surface area, reduced bandgap energy, high crystallinity, and the spatial morphology of the hollow sphere TiO2 that enhanced the charge separation efficiency. Hollow TiO2 anatase spheres with Au and RuO2 dual co-catalysts were documented by Rahman et al. [323]. Au nanoparticles were coated on the surface of TiO2 using Polystyrene by the sol–gel method, whereas, impregnation and calcination methods were used to load the Ru to form the desire photocatalyst. The highest hydrogen evolution activity was obtained for the photocatalyst with two dual cocatalysts (3165 mmol g−1), which much higher than that of using one cocatalyst. This enhanced activity was attributed to the role of both cocatalysts and the special structure of the photocatalysts in increasing the charge separation efficiency. She et al. [324] designed a hollow-structured TiO2 sphere with dual cocatalysts (MOx and Pt), where M is ultrasmall metal nanoparticles. MOx was firstly introduced into zeolite and Pt was decorated on the outer shell. PdO x @TiO2@Ptexhibits the highest hydrogen production activity (0.45 mmol h−1) that ascribed to the role of PdO x @TiO2 and Pt that act as a hole scavenger and electron trapping sites, respectively. Besides, the activity of modified hollow spheres in hydrogen production, there are also tested for degradation of organic pollutants (RhB) [325] and removal of antibiotics [326]. Additionally, three-dimensional (3D) photocatalysts have been widely studied in the field of photocatalysis due to their high surface area, facilitating the movement of charge carriers, and enhancing the light-harvesting [327,328]. Lately, three-dimensional ordered macroporous materials with a certain ratio of TiO2 and g-C3N4 were reported by Liu et al. [329]. The photocatalytic activity of the 3D-CN/Ti was evaluated for hydrogen production under simulated sunlight. Among different CN/Ti ratios, the 3D-25CN/Ti exhibits an excellent hydrogen production rate and stability, which is mainly ascribed to the efficient charge separation provided by the formation of the heterostructure and the special morphology of the three-dimensional ordered macroporous. Furthermore, the Authors demanded that the optical property of the 3D-25CN/Ti was also enhanced by extending the range of light response to the visible region. Zhang et al. [330] synthesized 3D flower-like TiO2@Ni(OH)2 core–shell heterostructure by solvothermal approach for determination of solar hydrogen production. The improved photocatalytic performance of the unique p-n heterostructure was attributed to the promotion of the charge separation and the presence of more surface active sites. Hu et al. [331] deposited different noble metals nanoparticles on defective 3D TiO2 hierarchical spheres. The solvothermal method was applied to the synthesis of 3D TiO2 hierarchical spheres with oxygen vacancies, and then a direct redox reaction was used to deposit the noble metals on porous 3D TiO2 hierarchical spheres. The photocatalytic activity of M/TiO2 (M: noble metal) was tested for hydrogen evolution. Pt/3D defective TiO2 showed the highest activity under full arc spectrum, whereas Au/3D defective TiO2 showed the highest activity under visible light irradiation. Their investigations indicate that the oxygen vacancy and the noble metals have a great influence in enhancing the light absorption, while the deposited noble metals have a main role in promoting the charge separation. Yan et al. [332] designed and fabricated hydrogenated 3-dimensional branched TiO2 nanorod arrays via a three steps method. CdS were deposited on the hydrogenated 3-dimensional branched TiO2 nanorod arrays. In this photocatalytic system, a Pt wire was used to connect conductive substrate FTO of the CdS/ hydrogenated 3-dimensional branched TiO2 nanorod arrays to form a high active CdS/Hydrogenated-3D-TiO2/Pt photocatalyst. This novel photocatalyst has higher photocatalytic hydrogen production activity than that without Pt-wire, confirming the role of Pt-wire in enhancing the hydrogen production of the whole photocatalytic system. Recently, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have gained great attention due to their low-cost, water-solubility, superior stability, distinct optical and electronic properties, environmental friendliness, and size-dependent photoluminescence [333]. Thus, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have attained increasing attention for photocatalytic hydrogen production applications [334]. Genc et al. [335] synthesized carbon quantum dots from Gingko Biloba using the microwave method. The carbon quantum dots was used as a sensitizer of TiO2 and tested for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation in the presence of TEOA as a sacrificial reagent and Pt nanoparticles as a cocatalyst. Enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of TiO2 is due to the role of CQDs in enhancing the charge separation efficiency. Similarly, Sargin et al. [336] obtained green carbon quantum dots (CQDs) from edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus (as a carbon source) by facile microwave irradiation. The CQDs were used to sensitize the TiO2, and their activity was evaluated for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. CQDs/TiO2 showed hydrogen production of 472 mmol g-1h−1, and the activity was furtherly enhanced by the addition of Pt (1458 mmol g-1h−1). Promoted charge separation efficiency in the CQDs/TiO2 photocatalytic system is the main reason for enhanced hydrogen production activity. In another related study, Sui et al. [337] prepared CQDs/TiO2-001 with remarkably enhanced hydrogen production activity. Their results revealed that the higher activity of CQDs/TiO2-001 even higher than that of TiO2-001 and CQDs/P25, which is mainly ascribed to the efficient charge separation offered by the formation of synergistic effect between the two semiconductors. Additionally, Yu et al. [338] hydrothermally synthesized CQDs/P25 and tested for hydrogen production under UV and visible light irradiation. Based on the photocurrent and the photovoltage measurements, CQDs play an important role in enhancing the charge separation efficiency and responsible for the enhancement of hydrogen production activity of TiO2. Pan et al. [339] synthesized carbon quantum dots (CQDs) modified porous g-C3N4/TiO2 two-dimension (2D) nano-heterojunctions via a simple method. Porous g-C3N4 photocatalyst was prepared by a thermal polycondensation, afterward; a hydrothermal method was used to introduce the TiO2, and then CQDs were added to graphitic carbon nitride and titania. After irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp, the obtained heterojunction (CQDs/C3N4/TiO2) showed an obvious hydrogen production activity, which implied the dual function CQDs with high catalytic activity in decomposing H2O2, which improve the water-splitting reaction and reducing the poisoning the photocatalyst. In addition, the up-conversion fluorescence could improve light utilization. Other reasons, such as the porous structure of g-C3N4 and heterojunction formation also have a great influence on improving the photocatalytic performance by promoting the charge separation efficiency. The as-obtained CQDs/hydrogenated TiO2 nanobelts heterostructures revealed increased visible-light absorption and extended its photoabsorption region to near-infrared were prepared by Tian et al. [340]. The improved photocatalytic activity of the CQDs/hydrogenated TiO2 nanobelts heterostructures can be attributed to improved optical absorption, charge carrier trapping, and enhancement of the photogenerated electron-hole separation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ ions in TiO2 nanobelts formed by hydrogenation. In another work, Liu et al. [341] designed and fabricated direct Z-scheme Cd0.5Zn0.5S/CQDs/TiO2 nano-film composites via a reflux process in aqueous using 3-mercaptopropionic acid as a stabilizer. The ternary system shows excellent hydrogen production activity higher than that of pure TiO2 and CZS/TiO2, which mainly implied the role of carbon quantum dots in enhancing the optical properties and charge separation efficiency of the ternary photocatalyst. Zhou and coworkers [342] used the photodeposition method to sensitize the Pt/TiO2 nanocomposites with the carbon quantum dots. CQDs-sensitized TiO2/Pt nanocomposites exhibit greaterhydrogen productionactivities, which can be ascribed to the efficient charge separation between the quantum dots and the TiO2 that improve the hydrogen production activity. Further TiO2 photocatalysts with different morphological structure and their enhanced hydrogen production are summarized in Table. 3 . 2.2.7 Defect engineering to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 Apart from the above-mentioned strategies, defect engineering is an effective approach to promote the photocatalytic performance of TiO2. In particular, recent studies have revealed that semiconducting properties such as light absorption, selectivity, and the photoactivity of TiO2, etc., can be modulated by its defect disorder [352,353]. Among different kind of defects, Point defects including oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ interstitials are two probable defects in the reduced-rutile and -anatase structures have attracted attention to promote the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 [354–356]. These defects have a great influence on improving the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 for hydrogen production [357]. Reduced TiO2, which contains Ti3+, has been demonstrated to extend the light absorption to visible light and increase the charge mobility [358–360]. While, other photocatalytic properties, such as the electronic structure, charge transport, and surface properties of TiO2 are closely related to oxygen vacancies [361–363]. Furthermore, oxygen vacancies are carefully investigated by theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, which revealed that they can act as adsorption and active site, and believe to impact the charge recombination process in photocatalysis [364,365]. Since Mao et al. [366] reported that the high-performance TiO2 with a surface disorder or defects can be achieved by hydrogen reduction treatment, this hydrogenation method has gained great attention for improving the photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO2 nanostructures by creating defect disorders on their surface [367,368]. For instance, Liu et al. [369] obtained black titania from TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays by applying high-pressure H2 treatment and showed an obvious activity for hydrogen production without using any cocatalyst. Interestingly, normal treatment (atmospheric H2/Ar annealing) does not cause this conversion. Ti3+ defect-structure created in the anatase nanotubes and responsible for the highest activity and revealed using the electron spin resonance (EPR). In another study, Tian et al. [370] used NaBH4 to reduce pure TiO2 nanobelts to the reduced TiO2 nanobelts. The high hydrogen production activity and degradation activity of the reduced TiO2 nanobelts were mainly ascribed to the creation of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy, which can ascribe to their role in increasing the visible light absorption, promoting charge carrier trapping, and hindering their recombination, thus improved the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, this study showed that the ratio of Ti3+ was optimized (55.8%) and presented the best activity. Wu et al. [371] created titanium vacancies (acceptor/donor) that were incorporated in the ultra-small yellow TiO2 and tested for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation (Fig. 37 a) without using any dopants or cocatalysts. The improved activity of the yellow TiO2 compared to the normal TiO2 is due to the role of the acceptor–donor defect in enhancing the charge separation efficiency (Fig. 37b), and improving the light absorption (Fig. 37c&d). Furthermore, Wei et al. [372] successfully prepared self‐doped TiO2 by a simple hydrothermal method employing Ti and H2O2 as precursors. Ti3+ species as well as the formation of oxygen vacancies are strongly affecting the hydrogen production of the self‐doped TiO2 photocatalyst. Importantly, the concentration of H2O2 and the hydrothermal reaction time have a great influence on the Ti3+ species and the oxygen vacancies. Their findings reveal that the optimum oxygen vacancy is contributed to the efficient photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalyst. In another study, Song et al. [373] fabricated a composite titania thin film consisted of quasi-aligned single-crystalline rutile nanorods embedded in sol–gel derived anatase aggregates. Controlled reaction between Ti and hydrogen peroxide was responsible for the deposited of the single-crystalline rutile nanorods on the Ti substrate. The photoelectrochemical behavior of the composite film was studied in details and represented that the presence of the anatase/rutile couple can improve the charge separation, resulting in enhancing the a steady-state photocurrent density more than double the simple sum of those generated by the two components alone. Similarly, Wu et al. [374] prepared Large-area films with ordered titania nanorods on titanium substrates through direct oxidation of Ti with hydrogen peroxide. The obtained nanorods was thermally treated at 450 °C and tested for photodegradation of RhB. The thermally treated nanorod film exhibited a stable and high crystallinity, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity. It has been reported that nanotube titanic acid (NTA) was used as a layered TiO2-based material due to its advantages such as large surface areas, strong absorption ability, and unique structure [375]. For that, Xing et al. [376] applied a simple calcination method to synthesize BCN-TiO2 nanocomposites. A hexagonal boron carbon nitride (BCN) semiconductor and nanotubular titanic acid (NTA) were used as precursors and the activity obtained nanocomposites were tested for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. Their characterization results confirmed that heating the NTA to a high temperature can create a single electron oxygen vacancy, which is very beneficial in enhancing the photocatalytic activity through enhancement the charge separation and improvement of the light absorption. Zhang et al. [377] hydrothermally synthesized C–N self-doped TiO2 photocatalysts for determination the hydrogen evolution activity. The creation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ during the synthesis process were determined using the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) andX-ray absorption near-edge structurespectroscopy (XANES) and believed to be responsible for enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the C–N self-doped TiO2 photocatalysts through improving the optical properties. Hou et al. [378] demonstrated that the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 can be affected by both the surface and bulk oxygen vacancies. In their study, nanotube titanic acid was annealed at different temperatures possesses different types and concentrations of oxygen vacancies. The authors claimed that different types of oxygen vacancies will be obtained through different calcination conditions (in air, single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancies, whereas, in bulk and surface oxygen were produced in a vacuum). Both types of oxygen vacancies show hydrogen production activity under different light illumination. Nanotube titanic acid–air (400 °C) exposed a higher hydrogen evolution rate under UV light, whereas nanotube titanic acid-vacuum (400 °C) revealed a higher hydrogen evolution rate under visible light. Cao et al. [379] recently demonstrated that the oxygen vacancies in TiO2 nanoparticles enhanced their photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. Furthermore, they also obtained the optimum quantity and distribution of the oxygen vacancies in TiO2 nanoparticles. Enhanced hydrogen production activity was mainly assigned to the improved electronic structure and light absorption capacity. Cai et al. [380] improved the photo splitting of H2S into H2 evolution of the anatase TiO2 with active {001} facet through the oxygen defect strategy. The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was improved due to the role of oxygen vacancy in inducing an intermediate energy level and reduces the bandgap energy, which is revealed by the UV–Vis (DRS) measurements. Consequently, the charge separation efficiency was also enhanced and observed from the PL spectra. Greatly important, the adsorption ability of H2S was also improved by shifting the adsorption energy to a more negative value. Zhang et al. [381] examined the role of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ defects in enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Au@TiO2 photocatalyst in the presence of ethanol. The Au@TiO2 photocatalyst was prepared in the presence of different concentrations of NaBH4 as a reducing agent. Their investigation exhibited that the concentration of oxygen vacancy, the Ti3+, as well as the number of electrons on Au were increased with increasing the concentration of the reducing agent, which lead to an increase in the selectivity and photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. Kong et al. [382] successfully synthesized g-C3N4/Ti3+-doped TiO2 composite by polycondensation of urea followed by hydrogenation treatment to create Ti3+ defects. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained g-C3N4/Ti3+-doped TiO2 composite was tested for hydrogen production and showed an obvious enhancement, which is attributed to the critical role of the Ti3+ defects in the construction of the Z-scheme pathway for efficient charge transfer and separation. In another study, Mohajernia et al. [383] enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the reduced TiO2 nanostructures through the introduction of point crystal defects. Different types of defects were obtained under different applied conditions and characterized using the EPR. Results obtained from the EPR analysis showed that the presence of two types of defects, mainly surface-exposed Ti3+ and lattice embedded Ti3+ centers, and are responsible for optimizing the hydrogen production activity of the reduced TiO2. Yu et al. [384] synthesized defect-rich TiO2 mesocrystals with the mesoporous structure using a hydrolysis method and tested for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. The presences of Ti3+ species, as well as the mesoporous structure, are responsible for the photocatalytic activity enhancement. Ti3+ species can improve the visible light absorption and prolong the lifetime of the charge carriers, while mesoporous structure can enlarge the specific surface area of the defect-rich TiO2 mesocrystals. Xu et al. [385] prepared N doping in TiO2 by a mild thermal method involve the flowing of gaseous Ar-NH3-Ar (AN) at 450 °C. Ti3+/oxygen vacancy pairs were formed under these thermal conditions and revealed by the EPR, XPS, and EDS analysis. Enhanced photocurrent density around 5 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 was mainly ascribed to the enhanced light absorption capacity proofed by the UV–vis absorption spectra, and for increased the charge density and reduced the flat bandgap energy proofed by the Mott-Schottky plots. Xu et al. [386] introduced defects based on lattice distortion in TiO2 microspheres for visible light photocurrent generation enhancement. Enhanced photocurrent generation of the TiO2 microspheres was mainly attributed to the combined effect of lattice distortion and defects. Defects lead to narrow bandgap energy by elevating the valence band; on the other hand, lattice distortion enhances the charge migration. Thus the existence of both Ti3+ defects and lattice distortion is contributed to the highest photocurrent generation. Wen et al. [387] applied strain engineering to tune the lattice parameters of anatase TiO2. Their results showed that the elongation of lattice parameter a of anatase TiO2 leads to the shift-up of the conduction band bottom and can thus accelerate the reduction reactions of O2, which is responsible for the photocatalytic enhancement of the anatase TiO2 for degradation of toluene and photoreduction of Cr3+. Lan et al. [388] developed defective mesoporous TiO2 microspheres with excellent mesoporosity and stable defects through a reductant co‐assembly approach. A maximum H2 evolution rate of 19.8 mmol g−1 h−1 was obtained due to the critical role of mesoporous structure in enlarging the specific surface area and the role of both mesoporous structure and atomic vacancy in effective charge transportation and enhanced the light-harvesting."
6,Different operating parameters affect the photocatalytic hydrogen production process,"In photocatalytic hydrogen production, the following are operating parameters that affect the process: surface area and particle size, pH, sacrificial agent, Amount of cocatalyst loading, calcination temperature, photocatalyst load, light source and intensity, and cocatalyst deactivation. These factors are discussed in detail in the following sections."
7,Influence of pH,"3.1 Influence of pH It can be considered that the development of hydrogen through the splitting of water depends on the concentration of protons reduced by the photogenerated electron into hydrogen molecules that are greatly affected by the solution pH. It is one of the most important parameters that mainly affecting the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production by changing photocatalyst agglomeration and controlling the substrate adsorption on the photocatalyst surface [389]. Furthermore, pH is strongly dependent on the characteristics of photocatalyst and substrate and is always changing during the reaction [390]. Additionally, the pH of the suspension may have a profound impact on the characteristics of the photocatalyst, such as functional groups [391], particle size dissemination [392], and surface charge [393]. Alternatively, pH affects the dissociation of the substrate (sacrificial reagents) [394] and their interactions with the surface of the catalyst [395]. Nevertheless, the study of the influence of the pH effect on the photocatalytic system is a big challenge because it strongly depends on the characteristics of photocatalyst and substrate, and the continuous variation of the solution pH during the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in continuous formation and depletion of hydronium cations and hydroxide anions according to the following equations: [396]. (1) TiOH + H+ = TiOH2 + (2) TiOH + OH− = TiO- + H2O Generally, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a two-electron transfer reaction and can occur in both acidic and basic medium as represented in equations 1&2, respectively. Normally, active catalysts in the electrochemical process are required to overcome activation energy barriers (overpotential). (1) In acidic media: 2H+ + 2e- → H2 (2) In neutral or alkaline media: 2H2O + 2e- → H2 + 2OH- These reaction mechanisms can be achieved through either the Volmer–Heyrovsky or the Volmer–Tafel mechanism [397,398] as shown in Fig. 38 [399]. Volmer reaction is the first common step, in which electron reacts with proton gathered on the surface of the catalyst to give an intermediate adsorbed hydrogen (H*) atom. After that, the adsorbed hydrogen intermediate is consequently accompanied by either amalgamation of an adsorbed H* atom with an electron and a proton (Volmer‐Heyrovsky pathway) or a combination of two H* atoms (Volmer‐Tafel pathway) and can be described according to the following equations: In acidic solution, the HER is considered as a multi-step reaction (Eqn (1)–(3)): (1) H+ + e− + * → H∗ (Volmer) (2) H∗ + H+ + e− → H2 (Heyrovsky) (3) H∗ + H∗ →H2 (Tafel) In alkaline solution, the reaction formula for the HER is represented as: (4) H2O + e− → OH− + H∗ (Volmer) (5) H∗ + H2O + e− → OH− + H2 (Heyrovsky) (6) H∗ + H∗ →H2 (Tafel) Moreover, the pH of the prepared solution has a great influence on the final size of TiO2 nanoparticles. Additionally, their small size raises the conduction band and lowers the valence band, resulting in changing the band structure of TiO2. This band shift affects the catalytic properties and splits the bandgap of the semiconductors because of a quantum confinement effect [400–404]. Bahnemann et al. [405] have already reviewed that acid-base properties of the metal oxide surfaces can have considerable have a great influence on their photocatalytic activity. Recently, Estahbanati et al. [406] performed a kinetic study on photocatalytic hydrogen production from different alcohols in a pH range of 2–12. Results indicated that the maximum hydrogen production rate was obtained at a pH of 8 due to the interaction effect and TiOH group dissociation (Fig. 39 ). It has been proofed that TiO2 particles tend to agglomerate under acidic conditions resulting in reducing the surface area, which has an important role in photon absorption and improvement of photocatalytic hydrogen production [407] With Cd0.5Zn0.5S solid solutions prepared by hydrothermal method and co‐precipitation method, Peng and coworkers [408] studied their visible-light hydrogen evolution from aqueous solutions of glycerol. Zn0.5Cd0.5S‐G exhibited higher photocatalytic activity due to the higher surface area. Importantly, the basicity that affects the redox potential of glycerol influences the rate of hydrogen evolution. In another study, Wu et al. [409] systematically studied the efficiency of H2 evolution for CuO x species over TiO2. Interestingly, the positive charge in the CuO x center and weak basic pH (ca. 10) affect photo-induced charge transfer and hydrogen production rate. Changing pH will affect the band edge of the semiconductor and the surface properties of the photocatalyst (Fig. 40 ). CuAlO2/TiO2 heterojunction photoelectrodes are studied by Brahimi and coworkers [410] for H2 evolution under visible light using S2− and S2O3 2−. The highest activity was obtained at pH ∼ 11. Furthermore, the adjustment of pH has a great influence on the bandgap of the catalyst. Nada et al. [411] constructed a TiO2/RuO2 semiconductor containing methyl viologen as an electron donor. The enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen production was obtained in acidic media because of the higher availability of H+ ions. Similarly, the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production over Pt/rutile/TiO2 can be obtained at pH 5.5 [412]. Zhou et al. [413] investigated the influence of different glucose on photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of Pt deposited TiO2. This study indicated that pH has a great influence on the rate of hydrogen production over Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst and clearly showed that the highest activity was obtained under weakly basic conditions. Moreover, Zou et al. [414] successfully loaded Cu ions on the surface of rutile TiO2 via the solvothermal method for the determination of hydrogen activity performance. At pH = 6, the photocatalyst shows the highest activity, further increasing pH, the activity decreases. Alkaim et al. [415] obtained TiO2 nanoparticles via a facile hydrothermal method, which showed high performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The study shows that TiO2 nanoparticles loaded with 0.4–0.5% Pt and pH = 5 in the presence of EDTA show the highest activity. Importantly, by increasing pH, the activity decreases that may be attributed to the charge similarity of TiO2 and EDTA. Cross-linked the hierarchical sulfonated graphene oxide (SG)–TiO2 composites nanocomposites with tunable band structure were synthesized by Gao et al. [416]. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts was evaluated for hydrogen production in a wide pH range. Photocatalyst with 2% graphene oxide at pH = 11 shows the highest activity (Fig. 41 a) due to efficient charge separation, high surface area, and more light absorption (Fig. 41(b-d)). Moreover, Yin et al. [417] developed a hydrothermal method for the synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride sensitized TiO2. After that, the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was enhanced by loaded Cu(OH)2 cocatalyst. Importantly, Cu(OH)2/g-C3N4/TiO2 exhibited the highest photoactivity at pH = 8. In another study, Badawy et al. [418] studied the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of mesoporous TiO2 prepared via a simple sol–gel method at a wide range of pH. Mesoporous TiO2 at pH = 3 showed the highest activity. Herein, pH value has a great influence on the band position and charge surface of mesoporous TiO2 that affects their photocatalytic hydrogen production. In another study, Fu et al. [419] prepared noble-metal-loaded TiO2 photocatalysts. Their photocatalytic activities were evaluated in the production of hydrogen in the presence of glucose. Maximum hydrogen production was observed at pH = 11, then the photocatalytic activity decreases at higher pH. This study shows that the photocatalytic behavior is strongly dependent on the pH, and the weak basic condition is favorable for the highest activity. However, in general conclusion, based on the previous research, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is enhanced in the basic media for the reasons mentioned above. Recently, Song et al. [420] studied the hydrogen evolution rate over four different BaTiO3/TiO2 core/shell photocatalysts. Importantly, at intermediate pH and 600 °C, the BaTiO3/TiO2 core/shell photocatalysts showed the highest activity that ascribed to the effect of pH on the surface potential, more negatively charged species adsorbed on the surface and draw more holes to the surface and the oxidation half-reaction. Fu et al. [421] sensitized Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts over a series of Keggin-structure heteropoly blue anions (PW12O40 -3, phosphotungstic blue, and others) and tested for hydrogen evolution activity under visible light activity at different pH (1–5), and observed that the maximum hydrogen production was obtained at pH = 1, with increased the pH, the hydrogen rate was sharply decreased. The explanation of these results that when the pH > 3, fewer photoactive materials were formed (PW12O40 -3). Furthermore, at high pH, H3PW12O40 was completely decomposed."
8,Sacrificial reagents,"3.2 Sacrificial reagents As mentioned earlier, the overall water splitting is a very challenging reaction to conduct as it is an energetic uphill reaction and followed by a largely positive Gibbs free energy (H0 = 286 kJ mol−1). Recently, many review articles have also been published describing the various properties of the photocatalytic water splitting process, including fundamental principles, nature of the photocatalyst, the role of sacrificial reagents, cocatalyst, and photocatalytic mechanism [422–441]. The sacrificial agents act as electron donors, consuming photogenerated holes in the TiO2 valence band, whereas, the metal co-catalysts loading on the surface of the photocatalyst act as hydrogen evolution sites, which act as electron sink and accept the photogenerated electrons from the TiO2 conduction band. Thereafter, the addition of sacrificial agents (typically electron donors such as different alcohols, ethylene glycol, or glycerol) with oxidation potentials lower than water further enhances electron-hole pair separation in TiO2. In such systems, hydrogen can be produced either through water splitting (H2O → 1/2O2 + H2) or alcohol photoreforming (e.g. CH3OH (methanol) + H2O → CO2 + 3H2 CH3CH2OH (ethanol) + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2, C3H8O3 (glycerol) + 3H2O → 3CO2 + 7H2). The role of the sacrificial reagent is shown in Fig. 42 [442]. Glycerol, ethanol, and methanol are the most common alcohols, which are widely used as sacrificial reagents in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Glycerol is produced in a large amount (10%) as a byproduct of the biodiesel production process [443]. Ethanol is the most common simple alcohol which can be produced by the fermentation of saccharides [444]. Another simple alcohol is methanol, which can be produced by direct pyrolysis of raw lignocelluloses [445]. Also, methanol was found more promising in a gas phase system because here the boiling point and the ability of vaporization are the key factors controlling the performance of alcohol as a sacrificial reagent in the gas phase. In principle, when the photocatalytic reaction is carried out in aqueous solutions containing electron donors, photogenerated valence band holes irreversibly oxidize the electron donor and can enhance e-/h+ separation. This improves the H2 evolution reaction (Fig. 42a). On the other hand, in the presence of an oxidizing agent or electron acceptors such as silver or iron ions, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band are taken by them and an O2 evolution reaction is improved (Fig. 42b). Galinska et al. [446] in their work - Pt-TiO2 catalyst with higher activity in photocatalytic processes, reported on the effect of different sacrificial reagents on photocatalytic hydrogen production under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Among different sacrificial reagents used, methanol (CH3OH) shows that the highest hydrogen production activity. Lin et al. [447] reported on the influence of different sacrificial reagents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production over N-doped TiO2 supported on Pt powders. Photocatalysts were synthesized by the two-microemulsion technique. Among the sacrificial reagents used in this study, the methanol solution exhibited the highest hydrogen production activity. Guzman et al. [448] also found that in the presence of methanol aqueous solution as a scarifying reagent and D2O over a Cu/S-TiO2 catalyst under UV illumination, the hydrogen evolution was enhanced. The increased activity in hydrogen evolution was largely due to the presence of methanol that acts as an electron donor. The role of sacrificial reagents as an electron donor or acceptor is reviewed by Schneider et al. [449]. Wang et al. [450] fabricated CuS/TiO2 nanocomposite by hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite photocatalyst was assessed to produce hydrogen in a methanol aqueous solution. 1% CuS/TiO2 showed the highest activity (Fig. 43 a) due to the efficient charge separation provided by composite structure and methanol (Fig. 43b). Umer et al. [451] noticed that carbon nanotubes modified TiO2 heterojunction dispersed in montmorillonite nanoclay prepared by combined sol–gel and impregnation approach. The visible-light photocatalytic activity of the synthesized photocatalyst was studied for H2 evolution with different sacrificial reagents. Among different sacrificial reagents used in this study, glycerol has the highest activity (Fig. 44 a) and the optimum amount was 5% (Fig. 44b). Tahir et al. [452] successfully constructed La modified TiO2 embedded over carbon nanotubes nanocomposite for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in the presence of aqueous glycerol as a sacrificial reagent. Enlarged the surface area, and enhanced charge separation provided by suitable band structure in the composite are responsible for the hydrogen production activity enhancement. Moreover, It is well known that the use of hole scavengers remarkably enhances TiO2-photocatalyzed H2 evolution in which the VB holes are consumed instead of water, making the system electron-rich and promoting hydrogen evolution reaction. For instance, Yasuda et al. [453] reviewed sacrificial H2 production in the presence of different sacrificial reagents, such as polyols, carboxylic acids, and saccharides. Similarly, Lopez et al. [454] synthesized Pt deposited TiO2 photocatalyst using a sol–gel method for the production of hydrogen. Methanol has produced better results because it more efficiently traps holes. Fajrina et al. [455] fabricated montmorillonite dispersed g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite via sol–gel/hydrothermal method for photocatalytic hydrogen production in the presence of aqueous glycerol. Hindered charge carriers recombination offered by the composite structure and the role of sacrificial reagent, bringing an excellent performance. Moreover, Liu et al. [456] studied the overall water-splitting of Pt/TiO2 using different sacrificial reagents. Among various sacrificial reagents studied, CH3OH and Fe(NO3)3 were the most efficient electron donor and acceptor, respectively, for the photocatalytic generation of hydrogen and oxygen over Pt/TiO2 catalyst. In another study, Madhumitha et al. [457] successfully constructed the core–shell TiO2/Fe2O3 photocatalysts via precipitation method using different sacrificial reagents. Results showed that TiO2/Fe2O3 photocatalysts present the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution when EDTA is used as a sacrificial reagent. Kumari et al. [458] successfully prepared the TiO2/carbon nanotube nanohybrid using the impregnation method for determining the hydrogen production activity in the presence of glycerol as a sacrificial reagent. Results clearly have shown that glycerol enhanced the hydrogen production activity compared to the methanol solution. In another study, Wang et al. [459] compared different sacrificial reagents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2. Among different sacrificial reagents used, TiO2/methanol shows the best hydrogen evolution activity. Chung et al. [460] enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen activity of Ni-loaded TiO2 using ethanol and methanol. Results indicated that sacrificial reagents greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity because they could capture the photogenerated holes and enhanced the charge separation. Slamet et al. [461] studied Pt-loaded TiO2 nanotube arrays for hydrogen production activity in the presence of glycerol as a sacrificial reagent. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalyst was improved in the presence of glycerol due to its obvious role in charge separation efficiency. Furthermore, Yan et al. [462] used sodium sulfide/sulfite as a hole scavenger for hydrogen production enhancement in the presence of CoO x -loaded TiO2/CdS photocatalyst. The role of sacrificial reagents and cocatalysts was believed to be responsible for the higher activity. Recently, modified modification of Pt/TiO2 with Nafion (Nf) to obtain Nf/Pt/P25 photocatalyst for determination of the hydrogen production was documented by Wu et al. [463]. Their study showed that the replacement of EDTA as a common sacrificial widely used in the literature with TEOA lead to enhance the hydrogen production activity in the presence of RhB that act as a sensitizer. TEOA exhibits much higher activity mainly due to its effective coupling with RhB and high dielectric constant, which are both favorable for the rapid regeneration of RhB molecule, confirming the high activity of RhB-Nf/Pt/P25-TEOA system compared to other photocatalysts (Nf/Pt/P25, Pt/P25, and P25). In another interesting study, Tahir et al. [464] embedded Cu nanoparticles over 1D/1D In2O3/TiO2 NRs/NWs heterojunction to enhance hydrogen production activity in the presence of different sacrificial reagents. Interestingly, among all, glycerol emerged as the best candidate in terms of holes scavenger, owing to its lowest oxidation potential. This is because less energy is required to oxidize glycerol for hydrogen production, followed by ethylene glycol, methanol, and ethanol. Also, glycerol has extra hydroxyl groups compared to other alcohols (methanol and ethanol have monools, ethylene glycol is diols, and glycerol has three hydroxyl groups). In the same research group, Tahir et al. [465] Fabricated montmorillonite dispersed Ag/pCN-TiO2 heterojunction for stimulating photocatalytic H2 evolution using two/three phases of photo-reactor systems. In a slurry system, using glycerol as a sacrificial reagent gives higher activity. The α-H atom and OH group present in alcohol structures define the amount of H2 production in a liquid phase photocatalytic system [466]. Similarly, Dosado et al. [467] studied the effect of different sacrificial reagents on hydrogen production over a series of titania nanorods prepared by calcination of hydrogen titanate nanotubes at different calcination temperatures and supported with gold nanoparticles. A 0.5 wt% Au/titania nanorods calcined at 600 °C photocatalysts demonstrated the highest H2 production activity in the presence of glycerol as a sacrificial reagent. The highest activity for glycerol is attributed to the numbers of the hydroxyl group, which influences alcohol polarity, alcohol adsorption strength and binding mode on TiO2, and also the oxidation potential of the alcohol. Moreover, several studies were also reported on the effect of different sacrificial reagents on the activity of TiO2 support for H2 production. Wang and co-workers [468] studied the correlation between the different aliphatic alcohols as sacrificial reagents and the hydrogen production rate over Pt/TiO2 nanotubes. Among different alcohol tested in the study, methanol exhibited the highest activity. Bowker et al. [469] studied the hydrogen production rates of Pd/P25 photocatalyst in the presence of different alcohols under UV light irradiation. Their results revealed that Pd/P25 photocatalyst in the presence of glycerol showed the highest activity. In another study related to the same group, Bowker et al. [470] investigated that the highest hydrogen production activity was obtained for Au/P25 photocatalyst in an aqueous solution containing methanol. Bahruji et al. [471] studied the effect of 20 different alcohols on the hydrogen production activity of the Pd/P25 system using 20 different sacrificial reagents and observed that triols (alcohol with three OH groups) presented the highest activity. Their results investigated that the electron donor alcohol must have a-H adjacent to the OH group(s), which affects the polarity, adsorption strength, and binding mode on TiO2. Furthermore, Li et al. [472] reported that the hydrogen production activity of Cu2O/P25 photocatalysts under UV irradiation is strongly related to the polarity of the sacrificial reagent. Their study connects the relation between the polarity of the alcohol and the hydrogen production activity and observed that Cu2O/P25 photocatalysts showed the highest activity in the presence of methanol. Su et al. [473] demonstrated that the high hydrogen production activity of the Pd(shell)–Au(core) nanoparticles deposited on TiO2 was obtained in an aqueous solution containing methanol. Further studies were also reported on applying different alcohols with different concentration for photoreforming production of hydrogen [474,475] The sacrificial reagent was mainly used for most of the research done on the overall water splitting. Nevertheless, if H2 is produced by a photocatalytic process using solar energy and sacrificial agents supplied by biomass; it will be a most promising sustainable energy source."
9,Amount of cocatalyst loading,"3.3 Amount of cocatalyst loading In heterogeneous photocatalytic systems, cocatalysts were mainly used to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen activity performance of the photocatalyst by improving the charge separation efficiency. Noble metals are commonly used as cocatalyst because their Fermi energy level is usually lower than that of TiO2 [476], making them a suitable candidate to form a Schottky barrier at the metal/TiO2 interface. It’s widely accepted that the amount of cocatalyst has a great influence on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance by providing more active sites for hydrogen production at the surface of the photocatalyst. However, depositing more cocatalyst above the optimum value, the hydrogen evolution rate decreases due to the occupation of the surface-active site lead to the reduction of the surface area. Furthermore, the higher dose of the cocatalyst prevents the light to reach and activate the TiO2 for charge carrier production, and therefore decreasing the H2 production. Besides, the excess amount of cocatalyst loading can act as a recombination center [477,478]. Therefore, the amount or concentration of the cocatalyst should be optimized to obtain the maximum hydrogen production activity under light illumination. For instance, Lv et al [479] compared the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the graphene loaded by Cu and Pt acts as cocatalysts. Cu-graphene performed higher activity than that of a pure graphene cocatalyst but still lower than the robust Pt cocatalyst (Fig. 45 a). The optimum amount of Cu and Pt was 1.5% (Fig. 45b). In another study concerning other cocatalysts, the work of Wu et al [480] for example successfully fabricated Bi2O3-TiO2 composite photocatalysts by the simple impregnation-calcination method. The results indicated that the optimum amount of the Bi2O3 cocatalyst loading was 0.89% mol shows the highest hydrogen production activity in aqueous glycerol solution due to the facilitated separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. It is well-documented that MoS2, a famous cocatalyst, was widely used in constructing heterojunctions with TiO2 in photocatalytic utilizations. For instance, Xiang et al. [481] synthesized TiO2/MoS2/graphene composite by two-steps hydrothermal method for hydrogen evolution activity. The higher activity of the composite photocatalyst was attributed to the efficient charge separation providing by the composite formation and the presence of a cocatalyst. Herein, the cocatalyst traps electrons and provides more surface active sites for hydrogen reduction. Furthermore, Ni(OH)2 could be used as a cocatalyst for the enhancement of hydrogen production over TiO2, For instance, Wang et al. [482] fabricated TiO2-Ni(OH)2/carbon nanotubes (CNT)/CdS hybrid photocatalyst, presenting a dramatically improved photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution. The optimum amount of 11.87 wt% of both cocatalysts (CNT and Ni(OH)2) (Fig. 46 a&b) present the highest activity due to the efficient charge separation by the two cocatalysts. Wang et al. [483] systematically studied the efficiency of the H2 evolution of TiO2 loaded with two cocatalysts (CuS and NiS) constructed by a simple hydrothermal approach. The optimal ratio was 5 wt% for both cocatalysts show the highest activity (800 mmol h−1). They found that the reduction in the bandgap energy, more visible light absorption, and efficient charge separation by cocatalysts are responsible for enhancing photocatalytic performance. Yang et al. [484] enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of TiO2 using MoS2 and g-C3N4 as cocatalysts and the optimal was 1.0 wt% for two cocatalysts. The efficient charge separation provided by two cocatalysts is responsible for higher activity. Zhang et al. [485] used a solvothermal synthesis technique to prepare TiO2 photocatalysts with NiS cocatalyst. 7 wt% NiS was optimum and displayed the maximum level of activity. Sreethawong et al. [486] compared the photocatalytic hydrogen production of Cu-, Pd-, and Au-loaded mesoporous TiO2. Photocatalysts were prepared by the sol–gel method. 2 wt% Au photocatalystexhibited the highest activity. Moreover, Chen et al. [487] successfully loaded different weight ratios of CuO cocatalyst over TiO2 for hydrogen production determination in the aqueous solution containing ethanol. 1.25 wt% CuO exhibited the highest activity. New non‐noble‐metal co‐catalyst Mo2C used in combination with CdS for hydrogen production enhancement was reported by Ma and co-workers [488]. 2.0% Mo2C/CdSwas optimum and shows higher activity than Pt/TiO2 and even much higher than pure CdS. Zong et al. [489] successfully loaded MoS2 over CdS photocatalyst for hydrogen production enhancement. MoS2 was used as a cocatalyst and the optimal was 0.2 wt% shows the highest activity even more than noble metals. Herein, the role of MoS2 in the enhancement of charge separation plays a key role in improving hydrogen production activity. Wang et al. [490] modified TiO2 by Ti(IV) and Ni(OH)2 that acts as the hole and electron scavengers, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of the modified TiO2 photocatalyst was tested for hydrogen production. 1 wt% of Ni(OH)2 and 0.1 wt% Ti (IV) show the highest activity. Efficient charge separation providing by the presence of the two cocatalysts is responsible for the higher activity of TiO2. Mahadik et al. [491] hydrothermally prepared Ni(OH)2/CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterostructure film on the FTO substrate. A Photoelectrochemical property of the prepared film was investigated for hydrogen production. Ni(OH)2 as a cocatalyst plays an important role in the enhancement of their activities. Chen et al. [492] enhanced the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 photocatalysts by loading them with CoSx. The highest hydrogen production activity was obtained when the amount of catalyst is 10 wt% (Fig. 47 a&b). CoSx as a cocatalyst enhanced charge separation (Fig. 47c), and light absorption (Fig. 47d), resulting in enhancing the hydrogen production. Moreover, Shen et al. [493] studied the effect of catalyst loading on the hydrogen production activity of TiO2. CuO and Co3O4 were used as dual-cocatalysts in this study and show that these cocatalysts enhanced the photocatalytic performance of TiO2. Both cocatalysts are beneficial in improving interfacial charge transport and separation, resulting in high photocatalytic performance. Tin diselenide (SnSe2) is an n-type semiconductor with a narrow bandgap of about 1.37 eV with a CdI2 type layered structure [494] can also be used as a catalyst to enhance the hydrogen production activity. For instance, Nasir et al. [495] recently coupled low-cost and available tin diselenide with TiO2 fiber and g-C3N4 quantum dots to improve its efficiency for photocatalytic water splitting. Their results showed that the loading of SnSe2 has a great influence on enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen production through improving the separation of charge. Li et al. [496] distributed a highly conductive Ti3C2 MXene and MoS2 rich in molybdenum vacancies on the TiO2 nanosheets through a two-step hydrothermal method. Then, a unique structure of MoxS@TiO2@Ti3C2 composite with molybdenum vacancies containing double cocatalysts is achieved. MAX phases, the precursors of MXenes, have the general formula of Mn+1AXn, where M is an early transition metal, A is a group IIIA or IVA element, X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and n = 1, 2, or 3 [497]. Besides MoS2 is an abundant and low-cost cocatalyst and can be easily used as an alternative to the high-cost noble metal cocatalyst [498]. The obvious hydrogen production activity of the new composite containing double cocatalysts was ascribed to the role of molybdenum vacancies in the suppression of the charge recombination as well as in the role of the double cocatalysts in enhancing the charge separation efficiency. Other cocatalysts can be used to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2, including cobalt sulfide quantum dots [499], Co(OH)2 [500], and Ni(HCO3)2 [501]. However, the optimum amount of the cocatalysts, and their cost remaining big challenges."
10,Photocatalyst load,"3.4 Photocatalyst load Previous studies have shown that the amount of photocatalyst has a significant influence on H2 production [502]. Generally, Maximum hydrogen production was obtained at the optimum photocatalyst concentration, above this optimum value, hydrogen production was usually decreased due to the photons cannot be continually injected, which leads to the recombination of electrons and holes [503] Besides, an excessive amount of catalyst in aqueous solution shields the incident light, and further prevents the generation of electrons from the catalyst. Furthermore, heavy loading of catalysts leads to the agglomeration of the photocatalyst particle, thereafter, the surface of the catalyst is unavailable to absorb photons and generate electrons/holes pairs. For instance, Nada et al. [504] studied the effect of different catalyst concentrations on the photocatalytic activity of RuO2/TiO2 photocatalyst. Different concentrations of the RuO2/TiO2 photocatalysts were tested and revealed that 2gL-1 has the maximum hydrogen production activity. Daskalaki et al. [505] obtained the maximum hydrogen production under simulated sunlight in the presence of glycerol as a sacrificial reagent over 2.66 g L-1 0.5%Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst. Besides, their results showed that the amount of Pt content and glycerol concentration have a detrimental effect on photocatalytic performance. Salgado et al. [506] also reported an enhanced hydrogen production rates for optimum Au/TiO2 catalyst loading up to 0.2 g/L-1. The photocatalytic activity was tested under simulated sunlight in the presence of different sacrificial reagents. Alkaim et al. [507] hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles with high surface area and their photocatalytic activity was evaluated for hydrogen production in the presence of EDTA as a sacrificial reagent. Different photocatalyst concentrations were loaded in this study (0.2–2.5 g/L-1), and they observed that the highest hydrogen production activity was observed for the photocatalyst concentration of 1.0 g/L-1, Further increase the catalyst content in the suspension leads to decrease the hydrogen production activity, which is mainly ascribed to the shielding effect. In another study related to the same group, Alkaim et al. [508] applied a hydrolysis method to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles with a high surface area. Photocatalytic hydrogen production was evaluated from the biomass-derived compound (citric acid) as well as in the presence of TEA. The optimum amount of photocatalyst loading was a critical factor in enhancing the photocatalytic activity, and it was 1 g/L-1 in the presence of citric acid and 2 g/L-1 in the presence of TEA. An increase in the amount of photocatalyst leads to a decrease the activity, which may ascribe to the agglomeration and shielding effect. Naffati et al. [509] synthesized hybrid photocatalysts containing different amounts of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and TiO2 by a one-pot oxidation/hydrothermal route. The photocatalytic activity of CNT/TiO2 hybrid was tested for hydrogen production in an aqueous solution containing methanol and glycerol as sacrificial reagents and Pt nanoparticles as a cocatalyst under UV-LED irradiation. Their results showed that 1%CNT-Pt/TiO2 displayed the highest activity (Fig. 48 a&c) and the activity is highly dependent on the carbon nanotubes content in the hybrid (Fig. 48b&d). Madhumitha et al. [510] synthesized the core–shell nano TiO2/Fe2O3 photocatalyst via coprecipitation method in the presence of different sacrificial reagents and tested doe hydrogen production. 0.2 g TiO2/Fe2O3 catalyst dosage in the EDTA as sacrificial agent exhibited the highest activity. The authors claimed that efficient charge separation was the key factor in enhancing photocatalytic performance."
11,Light source and intensity,"3.5 Light source and intensity The light source and intensity is an important parameter because it can control the amount of electron/hole pairs generated on illuminated photocatalyst [511]. Madhumitha et al. [510] studied the effect of the light irradiation on the hydrogen evolution rate of the core–shell nano TiO2/Fe2O3 photocatalyst using three different visible lamps of 47, 74, and 96 W/m2 light irradiances. They found that irradiated TiO2/Fe2O3 photocatalyst with 96 W/m2 exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution that may be attributed to the generation of more electron and holes pairs, which are used to reduce the water of hydrogen ion. Stelmachowski et al. [512] noted the influence of light power on the efficiency of hydrogen production of the Pd-TiO2 photocatalyst. They irradiated the Pd-TiO2 photocatalyst with two different power of Xe-arc lamps (225, and 300 W), and they observed that the hydrogen evolution rate was sharply decreased with 225 W irradiation, whereas, with a 300 W power source leaving the system as a gas with more stability. Xing et al. [513] found that light intensity plays a critical role in the photocatalytic reaction rate of Au/TiO2 photocatalyst. The catalyst was prepared by the photodeposition method, and its photocatalytic activity was checked for hydrogen activity at different light intensities of 0–7 kW/m2 and has a super-linear law dependence on the light intensity (Rate α Intensity, with n > 1). However, at a light intensity of 7–9 kW/m2, the dependency becomes sub-linear (n < 1), which means that increase in the light intensity above 7 kW/m2 showed a slight increase in the hydrogen production (Fig. 49 a-d). The explanation of the results is at the light intensity of 7 kW/m2, the surface plasmon resonance of gold was the critical factor in the super-linear relationship, whilst, for the light intensity of the range 7–9 kW/m2, the faster recombination rate of electrons and holes limits was the main reason. Yoshida et al. [514] produced hydrogen from the reaction of methane and water over Pt/TiO2 at nearly room temperature. The apparent quantum yield of the hydrogen production rate was obtained from the high light intensity (60 mW cm−2) compared to that of lower intensity (2 mW cm−2). Authors claimed that the formation of surface organic species and intermediate were influenced by the high light intensity. Kumar et al. [515] dispersed Ag2O nanoparticles on TiO2 nanotubes to form nano-heterojunction. They studied the influence of light intensity on the photocatalytic hydrogen production over Ag2O/TiO2 nano-heterojunction., and they observed that the highest hydrogen production activity (55.8 mmol h-1g-1 cat) was obtained in the summertime with a light intensity of 1358.8 W/cm2, on the other hand, the hydrogen production rate was 24.8 mmol h-1g-1 cat that achieved in the wintertime with a light intensity of 790 W/cm2). Wang et al. [516] fabricated a novel Cu2O/Au/TiO2 photocatalyst composite film using combined of three synthesis methods and tested for hydrogen production under UV light, visible light, and solar light. The Cu2O/Au/TiO2 photocatalyst composite exhibited the highest hydrogen production activity under solar light illumination. Authors believed that under solar irradiation, the charge separation was efficient due to the presence of the surface plasmon resonance of Au and the formation of the composite structure. Nomikos et al. [517] studied the effect of incident light intensity on the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate over Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst in the presence of methanol as a sacrificial reagent. The effect of incident light intensity was studied in the range from 0.5 to 3.0 mWcm−2 and observed that the light intensity of 2.3 mWcm−2 exhibited the highest activity. Further increase in the light intensity up to 3.0 mWcm−2 does not companied with an increase in hydrogen production activity. Importantly, the authors thought that under weak light illumination, band bending is relatively high for efficient charge separation, and the rate is the first-order kinetics. While, with increasing light intensity, the band bending decreased and the surface reactions strongly compete with processes involving electron-hole recombination. the rate becomes half order."
12,Catalyst deactivation,"3.6 Catalyst deactivation Up-to-date, most of the published studies are concentrated on photocatalytic hydrogen production using methanol as a sacrificial reagent in a process called methanol-reforming [518,519]. During this process, some physical and chemical changes on the catalyst occur because of their exposure to light irradiation. Due to the relatively small surface area of most photocatalysts, charge carriers require more time to separate, thereafter can recombine easily on the surface of the catalyst, thus these charges could reduce or oxidize the catalyst causing deactivation [520]. For example, cadmium sulfide is one of the most common in photocatalysis technology due to its low bandgap energy, which can be activated under visible light. Nevertheless, these materials can be easily subjected to photocorrosion during the photocatalytic reaction under the illumination of light, restrict its wide applications [521,522]. For instance, Villa et al. [523] demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of N-doped TiO2 for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. They noted that there is a clear deactivation of the catalytic activity between the first and the second experiment, which due to the nitrogen leakage to the solution in the form of NH+4 that revealed by the total organic carbon experiment (TOC). Recently, Huang et al. [524] found that the Pt-loaded TiO2 photocatalyst suffers from a deactivation problem. They observed that the formation of intermediates such as formaldehyde and formic during the methanol-reforming over Pt/TiO2 plays a major role in the deactivation of Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst. The gas pressure of generated H2 through the photocatalysis process, structural change, and phase transition have revealed by the TEM, XRD, Raman spectra, and UV–vis spectroscopy are not changed and are not responsible for the deactivation process. On the other hand, XPS proofed the presence of the intermediate such as formaldehyde and formic acid on the surface of Pt/TiO2 during the photoreforming of methanol, and these intermediate are responsible for the deactivation of Pt/TiO2 toward hydrogen production (Fig. 50 a-d). Chang et al. [525] fabricated a nanocomposite comprising gold (Au) nanodisks and TiO2 nanophases sandwiched between zeolite nanosheets and tested for hydrogen production through photoreforming of methanol. They observed regular deactivation during methanol photoreforming because of the formation of an intermediate. This deactivation process was attributed to the chemisorbed CO accumulated on Au in the absence of oxygen. Due to its higher affinity to be adsorbed on metallic Au, when the oxygen is absent, the CO is accumulated and does not convert to the CO2, which leads to blocking the surface of metallic Au, resulting in the deactivation of the photocatalyst. Lopez et al. [526] tested the Pt-modified TiO2 for hydrogen production in presence of different alcohols. Authors thought that several intermediate such as formaldehyde, formic acid, and carbon dioxide could be formed through methanol-reforming, causing deactivation of the photocatalyst. Haselmann et al. [527] investigated a sudden deactivation of Pt/P25 during the initial stages of photocatalytic H2 evolution from aqueous solution in the presence of methanol. They suggested that the CO generation through the decomposition of methyl formate is responsible for blocking the active sites on the noble metal co-catalyst and thus result in significantly slower reaction kinetics, resulting in deactivation of the photocatalyst. Chung et al. [528] used a one-pot synthesis method to prepare Pt functionalized TiO2 and evaluated it for H2 production. Authors appealed that slow CO-poisoning and metal encapsulation might also initiate the deactivation of the materials. Most importantly, the presence of sodium ions used in the synthesis procedure can strongly affect the hydrogen production activity, and the photocatalytic materials should be carefully washed before running the experiment. Besides, the above-mentioned parameters, the duration of the photocatalytic reaction can affect the total photocatalytic performance [115,395]."
13,Conclusion and future perspective,"With this review, recent progress in TiO2-based photocatalysts, and the development of modification techniques for photocatalytic H2 production have been systematically discussed. More important, this comprehensive review briefly explained the influence of the operation parameters on the photocatalytic hydrogen production over TiO2-based photocatalysts. In future research and development on photocatalytic hydrogen production via water splitting can be focused on the next aspects: • Low cost and effective preparation method: synthesis methods are very important that directly affect the whole photocatalytic hydrogen production process. Researchers in the future should focus their work on the development of the new synthesis methods using cheap, environment-friendly, and non-toxic precursors for the synthesis of the nanoparticles materials. Nevertheless, the sol–gel method remaining the promising method in the preparation of TiO2 nanoparticles because it’s performed under mild conditions. Furthermore, the obtained nanoparticles have good crystallinity, high surface area, and small particle size. • Enhancement of visible light absorption: visible light absorption is the first step in the photocatalysis process, more light absorption means more charge carrier generation on the photocatalytic surface, resulting in the enhancement of the whole photocatalytic hydrogen process. Thus, the improvement of this process is a critical step in hydrogen production activity. Several approaches need to be developed in the future, including the doping of metal and nonmetal elements. The big challenge in this step is to reach the optimum concentration of the doped materials either in the lattice or in the interstitial part of the TiO2. However, more dopant concentration can act as recombination centers that lead to a decrease in the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2. • Improvement of charge separation efficiency: charge separation is also an important step in the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2 nanoparticles. After the charge excitation step, the electron-hole pairs should be efficiently separated and transferred to the surface of the photocatalyst to initiate the redox reaction. If this step is not occurring as fast as possible, the charge carriers will be recombined either in the bulk or on the surface of the TiO2 photocatalyst. Cocatalyst loading and composite formation were developed to be promising methods to inhibit the charge carrier's recombination. But these two methods have some limitations and need to be developed. Most of the published studies used noble metals as a cocatalyst, these metals are very expensive. Thus, searching for other cheap transition metals should be researched. In addition, composite formation between two semiconductors with suitable band position is also not an easy task process, since not all semiconductors can couple with TiO2. • Sacrificial reagents (electron donor or acceptor) and the design of novel photocatalytic system for overall water splitting Using sacrificial reagent to trap the photogenerated valence band hole is commonly used in photocatalytic hydrogen production over TiO2-based materials. Alcohol, like methanol or ethanol, is commonly used in this process. However, it will be very beneficial for our environment if we could replace these sacrificial reagents with other waste products chemicals from the industry like glycerol as a by-product of the biodiesel industry. Researchers should focus on finding more sacrificial reagents as waste products from the industry. If that will be done we will kill two birds in one stone. It will be mostly important to produce hydrogen from water without using sacrificial reagents. Therefore, the big challenge for the photochemists is to design a photocatalyst for overall water splitting. Appropriate cocatalysts such as Pt for H2 evolution and Co(OH)2 for oxygen evolution could be used to split pure water and to suppress thermodynamically favored back reaction. Further research should be done to replace the high cost Pt with other low-cost transition metals. In this photocatalytic system, the photogenerated holes are used in a productive half reaction, rather than quenched with a sacrificial donor. • Controlling the morphology of TiO2 photocatalysts: it’s widely accepted that the synthesis of the porous materials has a great influence on the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2. Porosity increases the specific surface area of the photocatalyst by providing a more surface-active site for water reduction and facilitates the charge transfer. Thus, developing synthesis methods for preparing high surface area materials is still a difficult task because some of the methods require chemicals for synthesis that are toxic to our environment and the template used for some synthesis is also expensive. • Stability of the photocatalyst Cost-effective photocatalytic H2 producing systems should focus on the use of visible-light active and stable photocatalyst in order to allow their practical deployment. The stability of the photocatalytic activity is one of the most important aspects in a photocatalytic process because the stable photocatalysts have longer lifetime, easy to reuse or recover, leading to simplify the whole process and decrease the overall cost. Thereafter, clear challenges related to system stability must be overcome and the prepared photocatalyst should be chemically and thermally stable against photocorrosion and under light irradiation during the photocatalytic reaction. • Hydrogen transport and storage: Due to its high inflammability, special safety rules should be taken in dealing with hydrogen. However, hydrogen can be easily stored as pressurized gas and liquid compounds and easily distributable through the pipeline. It can be concluded that photocatalytic solar hydrogen generation using TiO2-based photocatalyst is an effective and economical way for sustainable energy production. In summary, we can say: (i) Metal and non-metal doping can enhance photocatalytic performance due to narrow the bandgap energy. (ii) Cocatalyst loading, composite formation, and dye sensitization improve photocatalytic activity by facilitating charge transfer and separation efficiency. (iii) Defect engineering is also a promising method to enhance the photocatalytic properties of TiO2-based photocatalyst by modulating photocatalyst properties. (iv) The pH has a thoughtful impact on the characteristics of the photocatalyst, such as particle size dissemination, surface charge, the dissociation of the substrate. (v) Polarity and the number of hydroxyl groups present in the sacrificial reagent also have a critical role in enhancing photocatalytic activity. (vi) An optimum amount of catalyst loading has a high activity, while with high concentration; the activity is decreased due to the shielding effect, the same is true for the cocatalyst loading, with heavy loading, the activity is decreased owing to the formation of the recombination center. (vii) Light intensity is an important parameter because it can control the amount of electron/hole pairs generated on illuminated photocatalyst. (viii) Hydrogen production through methanol-reforming can cause catalyst deactivation through the formation of intermediate through the photocatalytic reaction."
