0,Introduction,"Traditional fossil fuel shortage and environmental pollution due to the burning of fossil fuels have drawn the widespread concerns [1]. As a result, various alternate energies have been explored and utilized in modern transportation, including kerosene blending [2], emulsification [3], alcohols blending [4], etc. Methanol is regarded as one of the most promising alcohols since it can be produced from rich storage coal. Methanol is an oxygenated fuel, which is conducive to reduce the CO [5] and HC [6] emissions. Charging coefficient as well as the performance of the engine have been improved owing to the higher latent heat of evaporation of methanol, which also helps reduce the NOx emissions [7]. In addition, methanol also can be derived from biological sources and agricultural wastes, which makes methanol a renewable alternate fuel [8]. However, the trouble in cold start [9] and the problem of unregulated emissions (CH2O) [10] caused by methanol's high latent heat limit the promotion of methanol-fueled engine. In view of the rapid flame propagation [11], wide ignition limit and low ignition energy [12], hydrogen, which is generally realized to be another environmentally friendly alternate fuel, has the potential to mitigate the cold start and emission problems of methanol engine [13]. In fact, some relevant researches have confirmed the positive impact of blending hydrogen on methanol combustion. Sporadic researches on methanol-hydrogen mixed fuel have been performed based on the engine or by kinetic method. Gong et al. [14] studied the influence of hydrogen blending on the engine performance based on a methanol engine. The results showed that the engine performance was improved when the hydrogen was added, especially under high engine speed. Based on a hydrogen-enriched methanol engine, Zhang et al. studied the engine performance after blending hydrogen under cold start [15], different loads [16] and spark timings [17], and they found the addition of hydrogen was beneficial to raise indicated thermal efficiency, advance combustion, and reduce the emissions. In terms of numerical simulation, Gong et al. [18] studied the hydrogen blending effects on laminar flames of methanol-air mixtures, and the results showed the methanol oxidation was accelerated with hydrogen added. Also, CH2O and NO were decreased when hydrogen was added. Gong et al. [19] and Ji et al. [20] numerically studied the influence of hydrogen blending on the performance of a DISI and SI methanol engine respectively, and they found the flame propagation speed, brake thermal efficiency, maximum cylinder pressure, and highest cylinder temperature were increased, while CO, formaldehyde and the unburned methanol were decreased when hydrogen was added. However, the positive effect of blending hydrogen on laminar burning of methanol has been rarely studied, especially under various initial pressures. The flame propagation speed is related to knocking phenomenon which usually reduce the thermal efficiency [21], and sometimes deteriorate reliability of engine [22]. The study of laminar burning characteristics is of great significance and value for the application and control of fuel on engines [23]. For the laminar flame propagation, the combustible mixture is ignited by electric spark, and the flame front propagates to the unburned area, followed by the high-temperature combustion product. The chemical reaction is concentrated in the flame front. As a result, a large temperature and concentration gradient is generated in the flame front, resulting in a strong exchange of heat and mass, which in turn causes the chemical reaction of the adjacent unburned mixture. Laminar burning velocity (LBV) is an important fundamental combustion characteristic. Laminar burning velocity is an indispensable parameter for the verification of the reaction kinetic mechanism and the establishment of the turbulence model [24]. In the SI engines, the laminar flame propagates at the initial stage. The laminar flame then develops into the turbulent flame quickly, which is the high-wrinkled laminar flames [25]. For the situations with the same turbulent intensity and intake mode, the turbulent flame speed depends on the chemical and physical properties of different fuels, that is, the laminar combustion characteristics [26]. Therefore, the study of laminar flame is the basis of turbulent flame. Laminar burning velocity has a profound influence on flame stability, combustion duration and flame propagation distance in the engines [27]. There are various devices and methods to study laminar flames, such as planar burner method, stagnation surface method, and Bunsen burner particle tracer method [28]. Because of the clear definition of flame stretch rate and the ability to withstand high combustion pressure, the spherical constant volume chamber (CVC) has been used to study the laminar flame widely. In fact, a large number of studies have noticed and confirmed the positive impact of blending hydrogen on the laminar combustion of various fuels. There are numerous investigations involving hydrogen's positive influence on the laminar flames of alkanes, alcohols, and alkynes, so the laminar flame of the methanol-air mixtures with different hydrogen fractions should be payed attention. Tang et al. [29] reviewed the investigation progress of the premixed laminar flame of hydrogen-enriched combustion by 2015. Song et al. [30] studied the laminar flames of natural gas affected by hydrogen addition and they found the stretched laminar propagation speed was increased when more hydrogen was added or the initial pressure was decreased, and the flame stability was decreased. Huang et al. [31] demonstrated an exponentially increasing in laminar burning velocity along with the increasing of hydrogen in the natural gas-hydrogen mixed fuels. To describe the same observation, Hu et al. [32] divided the methane-hydrogen fuel blends into three regimes according to the hydrogen fraction, and result of kinetic study also showed the reaction was accelerated by blending hydrogen, which was caused by increasing of H, O, and OH free radicals. Tang et al. investigated the premixed laminar flames of propane-hydrogen-air mixtures experimentally. They found the hydrodynamic instability was increased when increasing initial pressures [33], and the effect of hydrodynamic and diffusional-thermal instability was related to equivalence ratio and hydrogen fraction [34]. The hydrodynamic instability is crucial when involving the oscillations of flame [35] and flow [36]. Li et al. [37] investigated spherical flame propagation of iso-octane-hydrogen-air mixtures numerically, and the results showed a nearly linear increasing was presented as the mass ratio of hydrogen increasing. Al-Hamamre et al. [38] investigated hydrogen addition influence on the laminar characteristics of the acetylene and ethanol, and the positive influence of hydrogen on both fuels was observed. Based on the above mentioned works, it is found that the kinetical and experimental study of the laminar methanol-air flames blending hydrogen is lacking and necessary. In this study, the laminar burning velocity and Markstein length, which are known as the most significant parameters, are obtained from experimental spherical flame images under various initial pressures. The initial moment means the start of ignition. According to the flame expanding images and related parameters, the flame instability is discussed. The CHEMKIN is used to analyze chemical reaction and interpret the flame performance under different initial pressures, equivalence ratios, and hydrogen fractions."
1,Experiment setup and computational specification,
2,Experiment setup,"2.1 Experiment setup The experiment is performed on the constant volume chamber. The process of flame expansion is recorded by schlieren system. Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic diagrams of the experiment setup, which includes 5 sections: the CVC, intake and exhaust system, data acquisition system, schlieren system, and ignition system. The chamber is 33.5 L, which is designed to keep the constant pressure during experiments. The diameter of glass is 76 mm, and the glass is mounted on each side of the chamber to form optical access. Some electric heating wires are wrapped around the chamber to heat it uniformly. The vacuum pump extracts the exhaust three times to realize the clearance of burned gas and vacuum state before injection of methanol. The combustible mixtures are prepared according to Dalton's law. The methanol is injected by a GDI injector. After the injection of methanol, 5 min wait for the complete vaporization of methanol, and the mixture is reheated to the set temperature because of the temperature drop caused by the gasification of methanol. Hydrogen and air are then added into the chamber according to the equivalent ratio and ideal gas state equation. For the test condition of low initial pressure and small hydrogen fraction (X h = 0.2 and 0.4), the partial pressure of hydrogen cannot be accurately measured due to the limitation of pressure gages accuracy. Therefore, hydrogen is mixed with nitrogen with the volumetric ratio of 1/9, and the mixture of hydrogen-nitrogen is added into the chamber to satisfy the accuracy of pressure gages; then, nitrogen and oxygen are added into the chamber. When adding a large amount of hydrogen, hydrogen and air are added into the chamber separately, and the accuracy of pressure gages is sufficient. The mixtures are centrally spark ignited by a pair of electrodes. The flames with the radius greater than 6 mm are chosen due to the independence of igniting energy. The fuel and environmental parameters are listed in Table 1 . A set of reflectors is utilized to realize optical pathway of “Z” shape. The two main parabolic mirrors are 100 mm in diameter with the focal length of 1000 mm. A blade is placed near the camera to realize the schlieren. The high-speed CMOS camera, Phantom V7.3, is used to record the flame expansion and operates at 10000 fps, 512 × 512 pixels, and 40 μs exposure time."
3,Theoretical framework,"2.2 Theoretical framework The LBV and Markstein length are calculated as follows. For the spherical flame, the rate of flame surface propagating towards the combustion chamber wall is the laminar flame speed [39]. According to the geometrical characteristics of the spherical laminar flame, the flame propagation speed, S n , is defined as (1) S n = d r u d t . Here t = 0 is referred to the start of ignition. r u is the flame radius. S n is measured under the effect of stretch and is named as stretched laminar flame speed. To obtain the unstretched laminar flame speed, it is necessary to reasonably quantify and remove the stretch effect. At any point of the flame surface, the stretch Includes the comprehensive strain effect due to curvature and flow field aerodynamic and is represented by stretch rate, α , which is calculated by Ref. [40]. (2) α = d ( l n A ) d t = 1 A d A d t . At any point of the flame surface, stretch rate is the time rate of change of the infinitesimal small surface element of area A , surrounding the point, normalized by that area. For the spherical flame, in combination with Eq. (1), stretch rate is deduced as [41]. (3) α = 1 A d A d t = 1 4 π r u 2 d ( 4 π r u 2 ) d t = 2 r u d r u d t = 2 r u S n . Then, to remove the stretch effect and calculate the unstretched laminar flame speed, a linear relationship at early stage of flame expanding was demonstrated by the previous study [42]. (4) S l − S n = L b ⋅ α . Here, S l is the flame speed removing the stretch effect. Burned gas Markstein length L b is obtained to reveal the stretch influence on flame propagation. For a spherical flame, laminar flame speed is equal to the sum of laminar burning velocity and flame expansion speed, and laminar burning velocity can be calculated from laminar flame speed. According to mass conservation, LBV u l is calculated by Ref. [43]. (5) A ρ u u l = A ρ b S l . The ρ u and ρ b are unburned and burned gas density. Moreover, flame thickness δ l is an essential parameter indicating the stretch and hydrodynamic instability, which is defined as (6) δ l = T a d − T u ( d T / d x ) m a x . Here T u is the initial temperature of the unburned gas, and T a d is the adiabatic combustion temperature."
4,Chemical kinetics mechanism and computational methods,"2.3 Chemical kinetics mechanism and computational methods Chemical reaction mechanism containing the essential elementary reaction is used in chemical kinetic simulation to describe an overall chemical reaction and its connection with the elementary reactions. An accurate chemical mechanism is the key to ensure the reliability of chemical kinetic analysis. The methanol oxidation process is calculated based on Mech15.34, which is a newly developed kinetic mechanism by NUI [44]. The mechanism includes the detailed hydrogen combustion reactions, and consists of 1011 elementary chemical reactions and 173 species. It is validated by newly measured ignition delay time and species concentration under various equivalence ratios (0.2–2.0), pressures (1–50 bar), and temperatures (800–1650 K). For methanol-hydrogen mixture, the chemical kinetic mechanism is regarded to be accurate for both pure methanol and methanol-hydrogen mixtures. The validation in current work is shown in Fig. 2 . The calculation result well agrees to recorded experimental data, which assures the accuracy of Mech15.34 on methanol-hydrogen burning kinetical analysis. A premix module in CHEMKIN, premixed laminar flame-speed calculation, is utilized to investigate the laminar methanol-hydrogen-air flames. The chemical kinetic calculation is based on the energy and mass conservation laws and the continuity equation. Different from the some other simulation software, the CHEMKIN used the adaptive grid to obtain satisfactory convergence [45]. First-order upwind difference scheme on convection and diffusion terms is used. The domain of calculation is from −2 cm to 10 cm, which is long enough to achieve the adiabatic equilibrium and zero-diffusive-flux conditions. To control the adaptive mesh, the curvature and gradient are set to 0.5 and 0.2 respectively. Initial temperature and mass flow velocity are set to 375 K and 0.04 g/cm3 respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Experimental results analysis,"3.1 Experimental results analysis 3.1.1 Laminar flame speed (LFS) and burning velocity (LBV) As the basis of LBV, the unstretched LFS, S l , is the main manifestation of spherical flame expansion. Extrapolating stretched laminar flame speed, S n , to α = 0 , LFS is obtained. Fig. 3 presents the LFS under various hydrogen fractions, equivalence ratios, and initial pressures. LFS is monotonically increased with the equivalence ratio for conditions in this study. Improving the hydrogen fraction is beneficial to accelerate the propagation of methanol flame due to the rapid flame propagation speed of hydrogen, especially for the mixtures blending more hydrogen, which is consistent to the previous study on other fuels with hydrogen blended. In addition, laminar flame propagation is inhibited by increasing the initial pressure. LBV is the essential parameter of the validation of chemical mechanism and prediction of practical combustion and emission in real engines. LBV, u l , is derived from S l according to the mass conservation. Fig. 4 gives LBV of mixtures with different initial pressures, hydrogen fractions, and equivalence ratios. Similarly, the burning velocity is increased monotonically when the mixtures move to the rich side for this study. Similar to the situation of flame speed, LBV is increased when blending more hydrogen and improving the initial pressure. According to the explanation from Law [46], burning flux f = ρ u u l ∼ ( λ c p ) b ⋅ exp ( T u T a d ) , here λ is the thermal diffusion coefficient of burned gas, c p is specific heat, and T u T a d is the ratio of unburned gas temperature and adiabatic flame temperature. All of above parameters are insensitive to the change of pressure. Therefore, the decreasing of laminar burning velocity and flame speed caused by increasing of initial pressure results from the increasing of density of mixtures. 3.1.2 Flame stability The practical flames endure stretch as well as the hydrodynamic and non-equidiffusive instability, especially propagating in the nonuniform and unsteady flow fields [46]. Markstein length, L b , is extracted to denote the influence of stretch, both produced by aerodynamic strain and flame curvature, on LFS and the instability mentioned above. Fig. 5 plots the Markstein length of flames under various initial pressures, equivalence ratios, and hydrogen fractions. Markstein length is decreased when enhancing the initial pressure and blending more hydrogen, meaning the destabilization tendency. When more hydrogen is added, the mixtures with the larger Markstein length move to the slightly rich side, which is due to the non-equidiffusive influence of reactants. Especially, the Markstein length turns to be negative when adding more hydrogen and improving the initial pressure. For flames with positive Markstein length, indicating the stretch inhibited the flame expanding, the protuberances at flame front tends to be restrained by stretch and thus a stable flame is realized. Conversely, the flame with negative Markstein length demonstrates the spontaneous instability. To understand the stability of flames deeply and intuitively, the flame developing morphology is presented in Fig. 6 . The images in the figure reveal the flame development of various hydrogen fractions and equivalence ratios. When blending less hydrogen in Fig. 6 (a), the behavior of flame is affected mainly by methanol. The unstable cracks appear earlier at flames of the slightly rich mixture. The flame thickness and density ratio, σ = ρ b ρ u , tend to be decreased when mixtures move to the rich side, which implies the exposure of the hydrodynamic instability. When adding more hydrogen, Fig. 6 (b), the flame is dominated by hydrogen. The cellular structure is presented for the slightly lean mixtures. The flame thickness and density ratio are decreased when the mixtures move to the rich side, which is synchronous with the flame speed, stressing the influence of hydrodynamic instability. When the deficient reactant is more diffusive in the mixture, the diffusional-thermal instability is highlighted. Therefore, the prominent diffusivity of hydrogen, which is the deficient reactant for the lean mixture, makes the flame more unstable [47]. Overall, the hydrogen blending in the mixtures generally destabilizes the flames. For a given hydrocarbon fuel, the thermal-diffusive instability is basically able to be neglected over various initial pressures [42]. The flame propagation process under various initial pressures is presented in Fig. 7 . When improving the initial pressure, the density ratio keeps almost unchanged and the flame thickness is decreased, giving a prominence of the influence of hydrodynamic instability. The less flame thickness implies larger density gradient in the flame sheet, where intense chemical reaction happens, and flame are more prone to be hydrodynamically unstable due to the nonuniform and unsteady flow field. Hydrogen fraction is a significant incentive for flame instability due to the light molecular mass, and hence the prominent diffusivity, especially in the lean-fuel mixtures. Fig. 8 presents the development of spherical flames with different hydrogen fractions and in slightly lean mixtures. Blending more hydrogen definitely destroys the stability of methanol-air flames, and the cellular instability clearly emerges for flames with less radius. The flame thickness is decreased, indicating the enhancement of hydrodynamic instability, while the density ratio is increased, which means the downturn of hydrodynamic instability. For methanol-dominated mixtures, methanol with a slightly low diffusivity compared to the oxidizer is the deficient reactant, who determines the burning speed and progress. The heat produced from combustion reaction is less than heat release by thermal diffusion, leading to a lower temperature than adiabatic flame temperature and a slow and stable combustion. The striking crack at the flame front is mainly due to the hydrodynamic instability. In contrast, for the hydrogen-dominated mixtures, the violent and instantaneous cellularity appears on the flame sheet. Referring to the moderate flame behavior caused by hydrodynamic instability, the excellent diffusivity of hydrogen, which plays as the deficient constituent, contributes to the intense unstable cellularity."
7,Kinetics analysis,"3.2 Kinetics analysis Reaction pathway analysis is performed to provide visualization and fundamental understanding of inner workings of the chemistry model and the relative importance of each reaction. Fig. 9 gives the reaction pathway analysis of mixtures under various hydrogen fractions and initial pressures. The methanol is mainly consumed by dehydrogenation, and CH2OH is the primary fuel-derived species. Most CH2OH is then further dehydrogenated and forms formaldehyde and hydroperoxyl. Subsequently, further hydrogen abstraction is continued and gives rise to HCO, while the hydroperoxyl is finally converted into water. HCO presents as the precursor of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. When more hydrogen is blended or the initial pressure is improved, the more H atoms are formed, and the importance of R5 is enhanced, which is capable of notably promoting the chemical reaction. Furthermore, when blending more hydrogen or increasing the initial pressures, the formation of CO2 is advanced. To ascertain rate-limiting reactions and thus realize the combustion process more deeply, the first-rate sensitivity analysis for reaction rate of combustible mixtures is conducted. The sensitivity coefficient, κ i , is defined as (7) κ i = ∂ l n S l ∂ l n α i . Here α i is the pre-exponential factor in Arrhenius expression of reaction i [48]. In Fig. 10 , the sensitivity analysis of reaction rate under different hydrogen fractions and initial pressures is plotted out. The reactions with positive sensitivity coefficient (positive reactions) promote the advancement of combustion. The reactions involving active free radicals and light intermediate species, instead of fuel special reactions, show the most influence on the combustion process. The chain branching step R5 contributes most to the propagation of flame due to the geometrical multiplication of free radicals. The free radicals then attack the large hydrocarbons and achieve the decomposition of fuel molecules, and a larger radical pool is established, which in turn promotes the chemical reactions. The elementary reactions, R3, R36, and R163, is in favor of the combustion due to the production of H, which enhances the intensity of R5. The positive effect of R27 is owing to the production of the more active radicals OH, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation of methanol. The chain termination reactions who consume the free radicals have the negative sensitivity coefficient (negative reactions) and inhibit the combustion process. Almost all of the reactions become more sensitive by improving the initial pressure, yet laminar flame propagation is restrained due to the further promotion to negative reactions than to the positive reactions [49]. The more hydrogen addition, on the other hand, enhances the effect of positive reactions and lighten the negative reactions, which is beneficial for the laminar flame propagating. The decomposition of methanol is of great significance in the reaction process, especially during the initial period. The blending hydrogen is significant in the dehydrogenation of methanol. Fig. 11 presents the consumption rate of methanol under various hydrogen fractions and initial pressures. The main consumption pathways of methanol are R115: CH3OH + HCH2OH + H2 R119: CH3OH + OHCH2OH + H2O The dominated consumption of methanol is the dehydrogenation reactions caused by H and OH, forming the fuel-derived radical CH2OH. Both the two consumption reactions of methanol are advanced by increasing hydrogen fraction and initial pressure. The flame under the higher pressure is compressed, which is in consistent with the experimental result. The starting point of methanol consumption is brought forward due to the hydrogen addition, reflecting the enhancement to the combustion process. The rate of production of R119 exceeds R115, which is attributed to the multiplication of H atoms produced by blending hydrogen. As a main intermediate species and harmful unregulated emission during the combustion of methanol, formaldehyde is supposed to be controlled seriously by emissions regulation. The rate of production (ROP) of formaldehyde is shown in Fig. 12 . The main consumption reactions of formaldehyde are R155: CH2O + HHCO + H2 R156: CH2O + OHHCO + H2O The main formation reaction of CH2O is R130: CH2OH + O2 CH2O + HO2 The consumption and formation of CH2O are accelerated when more hydrogen is added or initial pressure is improved. The rate of R155 and 156 keep almost the same for the certain initial pressure. Otherwise, the enhancement of R155, which is due to the abundant of H derived from hydrogen addition, keeps pace with the advancement of R130, increasing the whole reaction rates and promoting the flame propagating. In light of the sensitivity analysis and previous studies [50], the free radicals, OH and H play an essential role in the combustion process. Therefore, the ROP and mole fraction of OH and H radicals are performed here. ROP of OH and H radicals is presented in Fig. 13 . The dominated elementary reactions producing H radical are R2: H2+OH + OH R3: H2+OHH + H2O R36: CO + OHCO2+H R163: HCO + M=H + CO + M The main consumption reactions of H radical are R5: O2+HO + OH R27: HO2+HOH + OH R155: CH2O + HHCO + H2 The main formation reactions of OH radical are R2: H2+OH + OH R5: O2+HO + OH R27: HO2+HOH + OH The primary consumption reactions of OH radical are R3: H2+OHH + H2O R36: CO + OHCO2+H R119: CH3OH + OHCH2OH + H2O R156: CH2O + OHHCO + H2O When blending more hydrogen and enhancing the initial pressure, ROP of OH and H are accelerated. With the increasing of hydrogen fraction, R3 replaces R163 to be the dominated reaction of producing H and consuming OH. For the same reason, R2 turns out to be an important reaction producing H and OH. The obvious enhancement of R5, which is reasonable due to the multiplication of H brought by blending hydrogen, remarkably promotes the flame propagation and combustion process. For the comprehensive realization of free radicals during the combustion process, a necessary study on the mole fraction of OH and H in the flame is plotted in Fig. 14 . The slopes of curves for both H and OH increase when adding more hydrogen and improving initial pressure, indicating the more rapid multiplication of free radicals, which is consistent with the result of ROP of OH and H. For flames under various initial pressures, the dominated free radical is OH. Furthermore, the amount of H and OH is decreased when initial pressure is enhanced, which is responsible for the deceleration of burning velocity. With the increasing of hydrogen fraction, both OH and H are increased, leading to the enhancement of LBV and combustion process. In addition, for flames with high hydrogen fraction in mixtures, the H turns out to be the dominated radical."
8,Conclusions,"This study focused on laminar flame characteristics of methanol under various hydrogen fractions and initial pressures. The promotion of blending hydrogen on the combustion of methanol was confirmed, the experimental data can be used for the verification of the reaction kinetic mechanism, the establishment of the turbulence model, and the development of predictive engine code. The main conclusions of the experimental and computational studies are summarized below. 1. When blending more hydrogen, the laminar burning of mixtures is accelerated. Compared with the laminar methanol flame, when X h = 0.8 (P = 1.0 bar, Φ = 1.2), LBV increases from 0.65 to 2.35 (m/s) (a threefold increase). The enhancement in initial pressure has an inhibitory effect on flame propagation. When more hydrogen is added or the initial pressure is increased, Markstein length is decreased. 2. For the rich methanol-dominated mixtures, the hydrodynamic instability tends to be more apparent. For the lean hydrogen-dominated mixtures, the thermal-diffusion instability is prominent, embodying in the intrinsic cellularity of flames. When the pressure increases from 1 to 3 bar (X h = 0.2, Φ = 0.8), the flame thickness decreases from 0.37 to 0.16 mm. For the mixtures under high pressure, the hydrodynamic factor contributes mainly to the unstable flames, which is reflected by decreasing flame thickness. 3. The active free radicals have the largest influence on the dehydrogenation of fuel and fuel-derived species. Compared with laminar methanol flame, when X h = 0.8 (P = 2.0 bar, Φ = 1.2), the peak value of H mole fraction increases from 0.9% to 2.5%. The amount of free radicals is decreased under the higher pressure, which is responsible for the deceleration of laminar burning velocity. When the initial pressure increases from 1 to 3 bar (X h = 0.4, Φ = 0.8), the peak value of mole fraction of H + OH decreases from 1.52% to 1.01%. 4. The chain branching reaction R5 (O2+HO + OH) is demonstrated to have the largest positive sensitivity coefficient due to the geometrical multiplication of free radicals. Both the negative and positive reactions are promoted by increasing the initial pressure. The positive reactions are enhanced and negative reactions are weakened after blending hydrogen."
