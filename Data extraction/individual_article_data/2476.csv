0,Introduction,"The increasing threats of global climate change and energy crisis have prompted the urgent establishment of a clean and sustainable energy system [1,2]. Hydrogen, free of carbon footprint in the environment, is an ideal alternative to fossil fuels [3,4]. Water electrolysis is a well-known process for making pure hydrogen but requires active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at cathode to overcome the large water-splitting overpotentials [5–8]. Current benchmarking OER (IrO2 and RuO2) [9] and HER (Pt) [10] however suffer from scarcity and high cost. Alkaline water splitting has found commercial application [11] and bifunctional catalysts for both reactions can simplify the system and lower the cost. As such, considerable recent effort has been put to develop earth-abundant such catalysts, including alloys [12,13], oxides [14–16], hydroxides [17,18], chalcogenides [19–21], phosphides [22–24], and nitrides [25,26], etc. Despite such big progress, all reported bifunctional catalysts-based water-splitting systems suffer from high energy consumption with the requirement of cell voltages larger than 1.49 V for 10 mA cm−2 water-splitting current and thus are economically unattractive. The efficiency of electrolytic hydrogen generation is largely dependent on the anodic OER with high activation energy barrier for O-O bond formation [27–29]. Recent studies demonstrated that electrochemical reforming is a promising way to meet this challenge by replacing water oxidation at anode with oxidation of much more readily oxidizable species like alcohol, urea, and ammonia [30–33]. These electrolytic processes simultaneously generate chemicals at anode and hydrogen at cathode, allowing a much more electrical power saving than conventional water electrolysis. Compared with above oxidizable species, hydrazine has a pretty low oxidation potential of −0.38 V. Moreover, its anodic oxidation only gives N2 and water, free of environment pollution and catalyst poison [34–36]. These advantages point out that hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is an ideal alternative to OER. However, only transition metal phosphides nanostructures have been reported as bifunctional catalysts for both HzOR and HER toward energy-saving hydrogen production [37–39]. In this work, we report that NiS2 nanosheet array on Ti mesh (NiS2/TiM) behaves as a high-performance HzOR electrocatalyst with the need of potential of 218 mV to drive 300 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine. Its bifunctional nature of NiS2/TiM for HzOR and HER leads to the establishment of two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer toward energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen production. This system is durable and only demands a cell voltage of 0.59 V to drive 50 mA cm−2, 1.34 V less than that needed by hydrazine-free water electrolyser, with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency (FE) for hydrogen evolution."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials N2H4·H2O (80%), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, NH4F and CO(NH2)2 were purchased from Beijing Chemical Corp. RuCl3•3H2O was purchased from Aladdin Ltd (China). S powder was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ti mesh was provided by Baoji Yunjie Metal Production Co., Ltd. (China). All chemicals were used as received. The water used throughout all experiments was purified through a Millipore system."
3,Preparation of Ni(OH)2/TiM,"2.2 Preparation of Ni(OH)2/TiM A piece of Ti mesh (2 cm × 3 cm) was carefully pre-treated with concentrated HCl for 15 min to remove impurity of surface, and then deionized water and ethanol were used for several times to ensure the surface of the Ti mesh was well cleaned. After drying, the weight of each treated Ti mesh was recorded. The Ni(OH)2/TiM was prepared as follows. Firstly, a solution was prepared by sonicating the mixture of 2 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 4 mmol NH4F, and 10 mmol CO(NH2)2 in 40 mL water. Then the solution was transferred to a 50 mL teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, into which the pre-treated Ti mesh was immersed. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 6 h. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the resulting Ni(OH)2/TiM was taken out and washed with water and ethanol several times, followed by drying at 60 °C for 12 h."
4,Preparation of NiS2/TiM,"2.3 Preparation of NiS2/TiM To prepare NiS2/TiM, Ni(OH)2/TiM was placed in the hot centre of a tube furnace, and an alumina boat with about 2 g of S powder was placed at the farthest upstream location within the tube furnace, and then the tube furnace was heated from room temperature to 400 °C for 60 min with a heating speed of 5 °C min−1 in Ar atmosphere, then naturally cooled down to ambient temperature. The loading of NiS2 was evaluated by a high-precision analytical balance instruction and was determined to be 1.2 mg cm−2."
5,Preparation of RuO2,"2.4 Preparation of RuO2 1 mL KOH (1.0 M) was added to a solution of 0.01 M RuCl3·3H2O in 100 mL deionized water and stirred for 45 min at 100 °C. Then the resulting precipitate was washed with deionized water three times and dried in the oven at 60 °C. Finally, the obtained product was calcined in air at 300 °C for 3 h to afford RuO2 for further use."
6,Characterizations,"2.5 Characterizations Powder X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data were collected on Bruker D8 ADVANCE Diffractiometer (λ = 1.5418 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a XL30 ESEM FEG scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a HITACHI H-8100 electron microscopy (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired on a Thermal ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV photons)."
7,Electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Electrochemical measurements A three-electrode system was used throughout the electrochemical experiment with a CHI-760D electrochemical workstation (CHI Instruments, Shanghai, China) at room temperature. The as-prepared TiM-based electrodes were used as the working electrodes. A graphite plate and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively. In all measurements, the SCE reference electrode was calibrated with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 1.0 M KOH: E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 1.068 V. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted in 1.0 M KOH with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1."
8,Determination of faradic efficiency,2.7 Determination of faradic efficiency The generated gas was confirmed by gas chromatography (GC) analysis and measured quantitatively using a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure change in the cathode compartment of an H-type electrolytic cell. The Faradic efficiency was calculated by comparing the amount of measured hydrogen generated by electrolysis with calculated hydrogen based on passed charge. GC analysis was carried out on GC–2014C (Shimadzu Co.) with thermal conductivity detector and nitrogen carrier gas. Pressure data during electrolysis were recorded using a CEM DT-8890 Differential Air Pressure Gauge Manometer Data Logger Meter Tester with a sampling interval of 1 point per second.
9,Results and discussion,"NiS2/TiM was derived from Ni(OH)2/TiM via sulfidation conversion reaction. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for NiS2/TiM (Fig. 1 a) confirms the formation of cubic NiS2 phase (JCPDS No. 11-0099). Fig. 1b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of bare macroporous TiM with smooth surface. After hydrothermal treatment, TiM is fully covered with Ni(OH)2 nanosheet array (Fig. 1c). After sulfidation, the resulting NiS2 still maintains its nanoarray nature (Fig. 1d, Fig. S1). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1f) taken from one NiS2 nanosheet (Fig. 1e) shows well-resolved lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.28 nm indexed to the (200) plane of NiS2. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1g) shows discrete spots indexed to the (200), (210) and (211) planes of the NiS2 phase. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum in the Ni 2p region (Fig. 1h) exhibits two spin-orbit doublets and two shakeup satellites (identified as “sat.”). The binding energies of Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 appear at 872.2 and 854.1 eV, respectively [40]. In the S 2p region (Fig. 1i), the component at 164.2 eV is typical of metal-sulphur bonds [41], and the peak at 163.0 eV is attributed to the sulphur ion in low coordination at the surface. The peak at 169.7 eV is assigned to oxidized S species arising from superficial oxidation of NiS2 due to air exposure [21]. We examined the electrocatalytic HzOR activity of NiS2/TiM (catalyst loading: 1.2 mg cm−2) using a typical three-electrode setup with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The ohmic potential drop losses from the solution resistance were applied to all initial data [42] unless specifically stated and all potentials were reported on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. Fig. 2 a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of NiS2/TiM toward different concentrations of hydrazine. NiS2/TiM shows no voltammetric response in hydrazine-free solution. In contrast, there appears a sharp anodic current with the presence of 0.1 M hydrazine and an increase of hydrazine in concentration leads to further increased current density. These observations suggest efficient HzOR electrocatalysis on NiS2/TiM electrode. Fig. 2b compares the HzOR activity of bare TiM, Ni(OH)2/TiM, NiS2/TiM, RuO2/TiM and platinum foil (Pt). Both bare TiM and Ni(OH)2/TiM show negligible HzOR activity in the measurement potential range. Remarkably, NiS2/TiM electrode is highly active toward HzOR with onset potential of 40 mV and drives 300 mA cm−2 at a low potential of 218 mV which is much lower than that of Pt (E 300 mA cm −2 = 289 mV) and RuO2/TiM (E 100 mA cm −2 = 220 mV), implying NiS2/TiM is a superior HzOR catalyst. The HzOR kinetics was also studied by comparing their Tafel plots (Fig. 2c). Tafel slope of 22 mV dec−1 for NiS2/TiM is much lower than that of Pt (56 mV dec−1), implying the favorable catalytic kinetics for HzOR. A 24-h bulk electrolysis at 100 mA cm−2 manifests the superior durability of NiS2/TiM toward HzOR (Fig. 2d). The performances of the NiS2/TiM electrode for HzOR and HER were evaluated in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine. For comparison, we also examined the performances of this electrode for OER and HER without hydrazine. As shown in Fig. 3 a, this electrode needs a potential of −0.38 V for 200 mA cm−2 toward the HER process with 0.5 M hydrazine, only exhibiting a small cathodic shift of 0.06 V compared to the HER process without hydrazine (E 200 mA cm −2 = −0.32 V). For OER, NiS2/TiM drives 200 mA cm−2 at 1.65 V. With sharp contrast to this value, in the presence of 0.5 M hydrazine, it only demands 0.17 V for the same current density. This observation demonstrates that hydrazine is much easier oxidized than water. Beyond that, catalyst nanoarray on current collector favors more efficient electrocatalysis because such configuration exposes more active sites, and facilitates diffusion of electrolyte and gas. As expected, with hydrazine assisted, NiS2/TiM exhibit high catalytic activity. Fig. 3b presents the LSV curves for NiS2/TiM at different scan rates. This NiS2/TiM electrode only shows slight changes with the increase of scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1, suggesting efficient charge and mass transport for both catalytic processes [29,32]. To evaluate the stability of the NiS2/TiM electrode, accelerated degradation studies were performed in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine. The polarization curve overlays almost exactly with the initial one after 1000 continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) (0.40 ∼ −0.40 V, scan rate: 100 mV s−1) cycles (Fig. 3c). It is worth mentioning that this catalyst electrode also shows a good performance comparing with other HER catalyst [43–46]. SEM images (Fig. S2) suggest that this catalyst electrode still maintains its morphology and XRD analysis further confirms its NiS2 nature (Fig. S3) after 1000 cycles. The time-dependent current density curve under a static overpotential of 200 mV (Fig. 3d) demonstrates that this electrode maintains its HER activity for at least 50 h. Considering the excellent activity of NiS2/TiM toward both HzOR and HER, we made a two-electrode electrolyzer using NiS2/TiM as anode to generate nitrogen and cathode to generate hydrogen (NiS2/TiM‖NiS2/TiM) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine. For comparison, overall water splitting was also tested for a NiS2/TiM catalyst couple in the absence of hydrazine. As shown in Fig. 4 a and b, in the absence of hydrazine, NiS2/TiM‖NiS2/TiM needs cell voltages of 1.68, 1.79 and 1.93 V to afford 10, 20, 50 mA cm−2, respectively. With the presence of 0.5 M hydrazine, however, the cell voltages to reach the same current densities are dramatically reduced to 0.34, 0.43 and 0.59 V, respectively. Fig. 4c presents the chronopotentiometric curve for NiS2/TiM‖NiS2/TiM. As observed, a cell voltage of 0.49 V is required to deliver 30 mA cm−2 at the beginning and maintained stable around it for 10 h. At a cell voltage of 0.9 V, vigorous gas evolution occurs on both electrodes (Movie S1). The amount of generated H2 was further measured quantitatively using a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure change in the cathode compartments of an H-type electrolytic cell according to our previous report [10]. As shown in Fig. 4d, the generated H2 at cathode roughly matches the calculated one based on passed charge, suggesting nearly 100% FE.

10,Conclusion,"In summary, NiS2 nanoarray has demonstrated high catalytic activity toward HzOR with strong durability in alkaline media. Its high HER activity enables it as a superior bifunctional catalyst for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation by replacing OER with HzOR. The two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer demands a cell voltage of only 0.59 V to offer 50 mA cm−2, which is 1.34 V less compared to hydrazine-free counterpart, with nearly 100% FE for hydrogen evolution. This work not only provides us an efficient catalyst material toward hydrazine electro-oxidation, but opens up new avenues to explore the use of transition metal nanoarrays as an attractive 3D material for other catalysis and sensing applications [47–50]."
