0,Introduction,"Biodiesel has lately emerged as an alternative fuel with wide acceptance because of its reduction of most exhaust emissions, improved lubricity, higher flash point, improved biodegradability and reduced toxicity over conventional diesel fuel (CDF) (Christos et al., 2010; Knothe, 2006; Moser et al., 2007). It is usually produced by the transesterification of vegetable oil or animal fat with short-chain alcohols (Su et al., 2010). The vegetable oils being exploited commercially constitute the edible fatty oils derived from rapeseed, soybean, palm, sunflower, etc. Owning to the high price and a big gap in demand and supply of such oils, it is not feasible to produce biodiesel in developing countries such as China and India. This highlights the need for the development of technologies allowing the use of non-edible vegetable oils. More than 350 oil-bearing crops have been identified (Dorado et al., 2004); oils from 75 plant species have been converted to biodiesel and iodine value (IV) and cetane number (CN) varied from 4.8 to 212 and 20.56 to 67.47, respectively (Azam et al., 2005). However, regardless of the raw materials used, biodiesel marketed for consumption must comply with specifications mandating biodiesel quality, most notably EN 14214, which contains a specification for iodine value (IV; 120g I2/100g maximum) and cetane number (CN; 51 minimum), which eliminates the highly poly-unsaturated oil as a potential feedstock. Biodiesel properties included as specifications in standards were determined by the nature of the biodiesel components. As biodiesel consists of fatty acids esters, not only the structure of the fatty acids but also that of the ester moiety derived from the alcohol can influence the fuel properties of biodiesel. These structural features include degree of unsaturation, chain length, and branching of the chain (Knothe, 2005), and degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids is the most important factor. The properties of a biodiesel fuel, including iodine value, oxidative stability, cetane number, cold-flow properties, viscosity and lubricity, are directly determined by the degree of unsaturation of its component fatty esters (Knothe, 2008). Iodine value and cold-flow properties increase as the number of double bonds in the fatty acid molecular increases (Moraes et al., 2008; Imahara et al., 2006), while cetane number and the oxidative stability decrease with an increasing degree of unsaturation in the fatty acid chain (Knothe, 2005). Thus, only through modifying and keeping a proper degree of unsaturation can biodiesel obtained from starting materials of high degree of unsaturation can meet the specifications. Several approaches are possible to modify the fatty acid composition of biodiesel. A first approach is the use of oils with inherently modified fatty acid profile by genetic modification giving advantageous fuel properties (Knothe, 2008). A second approach is the fraction distillation obtaining biodiesels with different fatty acid compositions of fatty acids esters (Falk and Meyer-Pittroff, 2004). However, when the good distillates were selected for biodiesel fuel, the problem of application of the left ones occurs. A third approach is the catalytic hydrogenation of the feedstock and/or the fatty acids esters. In order to use fatty substances having iodine values greater than 120g I2/100g, more preferably greater than 150g I2/100g, for the production of biodiesel, selective hydrogenation is essential and practical, which reduces the degree of unsaturation without increasing the stearic acid content and limiting cis–trans and positional isomerisation as much as possible (Federico et al., 2006). Past attempts to reduce the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids in the highly ploy-unsaturated fatty substances using partial hydrogenation over conventional catalysts, lead to derivatives that were unsuited to the manufacture of biodiesel. In deed, the selectivity for biodiesel production in partial hydrogenation is difficult to achieve with the nickel (Moser et al., 2007) and noble metal-based catalysts like platinum (Nohair et al., 2005), rhodium (Nikolaou et al., 2009) and palladium (Fernandez et al., 2005; Pérez-Cadenas et al., 2006), resulted in the formation of significant quantities of high melting point saturated fatty acids, which prejudice the cold-weather behavior of the product obtained (Federico et al., 2006). On the contrary, copper catalysts were found to have good catalytic activity and selectivity in the selective hydrogenation of highly unsaturated vegetable oils. Cu/Al2O3 (Federico et al., 2006) and Cu/SiO2 (Nicoletta et al., 2002) possess high selectivity for hydrogenating linolenate C18:3 to oleate C18:1 with oleate C18:1 unreduced, therefore, the percentage of saturated is scarcely changed during the hydrogenation process. However, it should be pointed out that these previous researches applied two separate processes, i.e., the hydrogenation of triglycerides or esters and transesterification for biodiesel production. The employment of different catalysts and equipments for the separate processes could increase the cost for large-scale biodiesel production. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), an annual herbaceous plant, has been grown agriculturally for many centuries for its bast fiber and hempseed oil. (Oomaha et al., 2002). Due to the increasing demand for hemp fiber for clothing and paper and the development of technologies for hemp fiber processing, the cultivated area of hemp increases remarkably. China currently cultivates hemp over an area of around 20 thousand hectare, which will increase to about 670 thousand hectare in 2020 (Jie, 2009). In the processing of hemp fibers, the hempseed becomes an interesting byproduct. Hempseed contains 25–35% oil, 20–25% protein, 20–30% carbohydrates, and 10–15% insoluble fiber and a rich array of minerals (Oomaha et al., 2002), which could be expressed and refined to obtain the hempseed oil. Using hempseed oil as raw materials for biodiesel production is one of an important application of hempseed oil. Hempseed oil is a typical highly poly-unsaturated vegetable oil with an iodine value of 164g I2/100g, which is eliminated by a specification for iodine value (IV; 120g I2/100g maximum) of EN 14214 as a potential feedstock for direct transesterification to produce biodiesel. Therefore, the present paper establishes a one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation for biodiesel production from the highly poly-unsaturated oil of hempseed. Alkaline earth metal oxides and alkaline earth oxides supported copper oxide are prepared and examined as catalysts, and cetane numbers and iodine values of selective hydrogenated methyl esters of hempseed oil were also investigated."
1,Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Refined hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) seed oil, obtained from Xishuangbanna Dai autonomous prefecture, Yunnan province, was used as the starting material since it had an iodine value of 164g I2/100g which was higher than 120g I2/100g required by EN 14214. The acid value was less than 0.1mg KOH/g. The compositions of hempseed oil were analyzed in our laboratory through transesterification at 65°C for 3h with methanol using 1wt.% NaOH. According to GC analysis, the fatty acid consisted of palmitic acid 6.64%, stearic acid 2.76%, oleic acid 10.12%, linoleic acid 54.31%, linolenic acid (C18:3) 23.76%, and traces of other acids. All chemicals used were of analytical grade, which were purchased from Beijing Chemical Co., Ltd., China."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO, and CuO catalysts were prepared by the conventional precipitation method from Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, Sr(NO3)2, Ba(NO3)2, and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O using ammonium bicarbonate as precipitate. The catalyst preparation was attempted into a three neck flask equipped with mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel. Two aqueous solutions were first prepared. For a typical catalyst preparation, the first was a solution of 25.6gMg (NO3)2·6H2O, (0.10mol) in 100ml distilled water. The second was a solution of 9.6g ammonium bicarbonate (anhydrous, 0.10mol) in 100ml distilled water. The first solution was put into the flask where the second one was added under vigorous stirring at ambient temperature. After that, the mixture was stirred for 4h to form precipitate. The precipitate was washed with distilled water, dried under vacuum at 120°C, and then calcinated at 1000°C in vacuum for 5h. Alkaline earth oxides loaded with copper oxide were prepared by the chemisorption–hydrolysis (CH) method (Nicoletta et al., 2002). The support was added to a (Cu(NH3)4)2+ solution prepared by adding NH4OH to a Cu(NO3)2·3H2O solution until pH was 9. After 20min under stirring, the slurry was slowly diluted in order to allow hydrolysis of the copper complex and deposition of the finely dispersed product to occur. After that, the solids were separated by filtration, dried overnight at 120°C. Prior to each reaction, the as-prepared catalysts were calcined at 1000°C in vacuum for 5h. The loading amounts of copper oxide were calculated on the basis of the amounts of the initial materials."
4,Base strength determination,"2.3 Base strength determination Basic strengths of the catalysts (H−) were determined using Hammett indicators (Kawashima et al., 2009). About 25mg of the catalyst sample was shaken with 5mL of a solution of Hammett indicator diluted in methanol and left to equilibrate for 2h. After the equilibration, the color of the catalyst was noted. The following Hammett indictors were used: neutral red (pKBH+ =6.8), phenolphthalein (pKBH+ =9.3), 2,4-dinitroaniline (pKBH+ =15.0), 4-nitroaniline (pKBH+ =18.4) and 4-chloroaniline (pKBH+ =26.5). The base strength is quoted as being stronger than the weakest indicator which exhibits a color change, but weaker than the strongest indicator that produces no change."
5,Reaction procedure,"2.4 Reaction procedure The catalytic performance of alkaline earth metal oxides and alkaline earth metal oxides supported copper oxide were evaluated in the one-pot process combining transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol and selective hydrogenation of methyl esters. For a typical reaction, 100±0.01g of hempseed oil and 50±0.1mL of anhydrous methanol (molar ratio of methanol to hempseed oil=12:1) with 3±0.01g of catalyst immersed (weight ratio of catalyst to hempseed oil=3%) was charged into a 500mL stainless steal autoclave, which equipped with a stirrer and a cooling jacket surrounded by a heating mantle controlled by a proportional Integra derivative (PID) temperature controller. The autoclave was purged with nitrogen, and the last traces of N2/air were removed by a number of pressurizing/depressurizing cycles with H2 before the reaction and then the autoclave was pressured and the contents were heated to 180±1°C with a rate of 5°C/min, constant in all the experiments with constant stirring at 1000rpm. The one-pot process was carried out at 3.0±0.01MPa for 3h. At the end of reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, vented of H2 and the product mixture was removed. The catalyst was separated from the reaction solution by filtration. The alcohol phase (glycerin and methanol in excess) was separated from the organic phase (methyl esters) by decantation, and finally the residual methanol in the methyl ester phase was eliminated by distillation."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis The products collected were immediately analyzed by a SP-3420A gas chromatograph from Beijing Beifen–Ruili Analytical Instrument (Group) Co. Ltd., equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a BFSP-0677-02 capillary column (2m×0.32mm×0.25μm). Methyl heptadecanoate was used as the internal standard to determine the amounts of products. The injector temperature was 240°C and the detector temperature was 250°C. The analysis of biodiesel for each sample was carried out by dissolving 1mL of biodiesel sample into 5mL of acetone and injecting 1μl of this solution in GC. The yield of biodiesel (FAME) with respect to hempseed oil was calculated from the content of methyl esters analyzed by GC with the following equation: Yield = Amount of biodiesel(mol) 3 × Charge amount of oil(mol) × 100 ( % ) Cetane numbers of biodiesel samples were determined in the Waukesha A111462B, which was calibrated with hexadecane and 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane (HMN) as primary reference fuels, according to GB/T386 method (China-GB/T386, 1991). Iodine values of biodiesel samples were determined by AOCS Official methods Cd 1-25 (AOCS, 1089). Density, kinematic viscosity at 40°C, flash point in open vase, and pour point were evaluated according to American Society for Testing and Materials standard methods: ASTM D1298, ASTM D445, ASTM D92, ASTM D97, respectively. The acid value was determined according to the International Organization for Standardization ISO 660."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalytic activities of transesterification and hydrogenation in the one-pot process,"3.1 Catalytic activities of transesterification and hydrogenation in the one-pot process Alkaline earth metal oxides, including MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO, used as heterogeneous basic catalysts for the transesterification of triglycerides with methanol have been published. The obtained results revealed that alkaline earth metal oxides became active for transesterification after a thermal pretreatment and the catalytic activities were predominant upon their alkalinities (Helwani et al., 2009; Patil and Deng, 2009; Singh and Fernando, 2007). As the basic strength increased in the order of MgO<CaO<SrO<BaO, which was attributed to the decrease of electro-negativity of the conjugated metal cation of alkaline earth metal oxides, the catalytic activities of transesterification exhibited in the same sequence. SrO had basic sites stronger than H− =26.5 and gave a biodiesel yield in excess of 95% at 65°C within 30min in the transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel (Liu et al., 2007). MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO were also reported to show catalytic activity for hydrogenation of olefins. The alkaline earth metal oxides became active on evacuating above 600°C and showed maximum activities in the order of MgO<CaO<BaO<SrO when evacuated around 1000°C (Hattori et al., 1975). It is suggested that alkaline earth metal oxides evacuated at high temperature showed catalytic activity for transesterification of triglycerides with methanol or hydrogenation of olefins. In this paper, therefore, alkaline earth metal oxides were investigated for a one-pot process combining transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol and hydrogenation of hempseed oil methyl esters. Basic strengths and catalytic activities in terms of biodiesel yields and the compositions of biodiesels of alkaline earth metal oxides were listed in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, the basic strength of alkaline earth metal oxides, which were determined using Hammett indicators, increased in the order Mg<Ca<Sr=Ba. The SrO and BaO samples owned the highest basic strength with H− >26.5 and gave high activities for transesterification, whereas the MgO and CaO samples possessed weaker basic sites with H− <26.5 and performed lower biodiesel yields. It seems that such catalytic activities for transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol at a hydrogen pressure are dependent upon the basic strengths of alkaline earth metal oxides which are consistent with those reported by Patil and Deng (2009). Compared with the biodiesel obtained through transesterification by NaOH at 65°C (see Table 1), the biodiesels obtained by alkaline earth metal oxides showed no obvious differences of iodine value and the amount of un-saturates such as linolenate (C18:3), linoleate (C18: 2), and oleate (C18:1), indicated that alkaline earth metal oxides gave poor activity for hydrogenation. It is likely that alkaline earth metal oxides are effective catalysts for transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol but can not efficiently catalyze the hydrogenation of fatty acid esters. Alkaline earth metal oxides are active catalysts for the transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol at a hydrogen pressure, as discussed above, while copper catalysts were reported to be active in the hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl esters and triglyceride and selective for the reduction of linolenate (C18:3) to oleate (C18:1) leaving stearate (C18:0) unaffected (Federico et al., 2006; Nicoletta et al., 2002). A series of alkaline earth metal oxides loaded with 10wt.% CuO were prepared and tested in the one-pot process to examine the influence of the support on the catalytic performances of transesterification and hydrogenation. Basic strengths and catalytic activities in terms of biodiesel yields and the compositions as well as iodine values were also listed in Table 1. As can be seen, MgO loaded with copper oxide exhibited the same basic strength as MgO with H− in the range of 9.3–15, whereas CaO, SrO, and BaO loaded with copper oxide showed a lower basic strength with H− in the range of 15–18.4 compared to those of the pure alkaline earth metal oxides. It suggested that the loading of copper oxide led to decreases of basic strengths of alkaline earth metal oxides. With the reduction of basic strength, thereafter, the biodiesel yields decreased slightly. The as-synthesized biodiesels by alkaline earth metal oxides loaded with copper oxide showed lower amounts of methyl linolenate (C18:3) and methyl linoleate (C18:2), and higher amount of methyl oleate (C18:1), resulting in lower iodine values, which indicated that alkaline earth metal oxides loaded with copper oxide showed higher activities toward hydrogenation and higher selectivity for increasing methyl oleate (C18:1) than alkaline earth metal oxides. Among the catalysts tested, SrO loaded with copper oxide gave the highest decrease of iodine value from 164g I2/100g to 113g I2/100g and presented the lowest methyl linolenate (18:3) and methyl linoleate (C18:2) contents and the highest amount of methyl oleate (C18:1) with the methyl stearate (C18:0) and methyl palmitate (C16:0) unchanged. It seems that alkaline earth metal oxides loaded with copper oxide were both active for the transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol and selective hydrogenation of methyl esters and Cu/SrO catalysts exhibited the best catalytic performance of transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol and selective hydrogenation of methyl esters under the experimental conditions used. The influence of the copper oxide loading in Cu/SrO catalysts on the activities for transesterification and selective hydrogenation was further investigated and the results are also listed in Table 1. As shown in this table, SrO with copper oxide loadings ranged from 1% to 30% showed the same strength of basic sites with H− in the range of 15.0–18.4 and exhibited high activities for transesterification with biodiesel yields ⩾90%. When the CuO loading increased from 1% to 10%, methyl linolenate (18:3) and methyl linoleate (C18:2) decreased gradually and methyl oleate (C18:1) increased considerably. A further increase of the CuO loading, from 10% to 30%, resulted in increases of methyl linolenate (18:3) and methyl linoleate (C18:2) and a decrease of methyl oleate (C18:1). As a result, the copper oxide loading amount of 10% is the optimum loading for Cu/SrO catalyst for the selective hydrogenation under conditions employed in our study. Actually, the amount of methyl linolenate (18:3) has been lowered to less than 0.5%. The total amount of poly-un-saturate fatty acid methyl esters (PUFA) was reduced to 42.22%, which was lower than that of hempseed oil methyl esters (HSME) (78.07%). The overall amount of saturates vs. un-saturates was essentially unchanged from hempseed oil methyl esters (HSME) to selective hydrogenated hempseed oil methyl esters (SHHSME) because the amount of mono-un-saturates has increased from HSME (10.12%, 18:1) to SHSME (46.65%, 18:1). Those results of hydrogenation selectivity are in perfect agreement with those obtained by Nicoletta et al. (2002) who performed the selective hydrogenation of soybean oil methyl esters using CuO/SiO2 as catalyst. The high selectivity towards the methyl linolenate and non-existing formation of saturates of Cu/SrO catalysts are in accordance with the mechanism proposed by Dijkstra (2002). Copper catalysts only hydrogenate double bonds in methylene interrupted poly-unsaturated fatty acid derivatives. And thus the copper-catalyzed reaction stops when the fatty acid derivatives present in the reaction mixture are only monounsaturated fatty acids and poly-unsaturated fatty acids in which the double bonds are separated by more than one methylene group, allowing copper catalysts to exhibit very high oleic acid selectivity (Dijkstra, 2002). It is noticed that the amount of methyl linoleate (C18:2) was only reduced from 54.31% to 41.73% and the remaining di-un-saturates may be further hydrogenated to mono-un-saturates by increasing hydrogen pressure or extending reaction time or using a pre-reduced copper catalyst (Nicoletta et al., 2002). This optimum loading for Cu/SrO catalysts would originate predominantly from the evolution of the morphology and structures of Cu/SrO catalysts with the increase of the loading of copper oxide, which were suggested for further work and to be a part of a future full paper. Comparatively, 10%Ni/SrO and 10%Ni–10%Cu/SrO catalysts were also performed in a one-pot process combining transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol and hydrogenation of hempseed oil methyl esters. Their basic strengths and catalytic activities in terms of biodiesel yields and the compositions of as-synthesized biodiesels as well as iodine values were also showed in Table 1. It can be seen that Ni/SrO and Ni–Cu/SrO catalysts presented basic strengths with H− in the range of 15–18.4 and exhibited biodiesel yields higher than 94%. The biodiesel obtained by Ni/SrO showed a lower iodine value of 121g I2/100g, suggesting that Ni/SrO were also active for the hydrogenation of hempseed oil methyl esters. However, the observation of a large amount of methyl stearate confirmed the poor selectivity for limiting saturates of biodiesels, which are similar to those already reported by authors Moser et al. (2007); Karabulut et al. (2003) who found that Ni catalysts showed rather low diene:monoene selectivity and gave early formation of saturated compounds in the oil hydrogenation. In contrast to Ni/SrO, Ni–Cu/SrO presented lower content of C18:0 and higher content of C18:1, suggesting the addition of Cu promoted the selectivity for methyl oleate and prevailed over the selectivity for methyl stearate. Ni-based catalysts presented a significant amount of methyl stearate, which has a much higher melting point than unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters, thereafter, the obtained biodiesels could suffer from bad cold-flow properties (Imahara et al., 2006; Knothe, 2005). Copper-based catalysts have long been known in edible oils hydrogenation as the most selective ones for the reduction of linolenate C18:3 to oleate C18:1 without increasing of stearate C18:0, thus, the degree of saturation is scarcely changed during the hydrogenation process (Federico et al., 2006). Copper catalysts were usually charged into the oil as divalent oxidic compounds, which were partly reduced to metal during use (Johansson and Lundin, 1979). Thus the active phases of copper catalysts must consist of Cu+ compounds and/or Cu0 (Johansson and Lundin, 1979; Nicoletta et al., 2002). It can be speculated that the catalytic activity for hydrogenation was first obtained from the catalyst subjected to reduction and then eventually from the metal-reduced form of catalyst. When the experimental Cu/SrO catalysts prepared by the chemisorption–hydrolysis (CH) method were charged into the oil in the oxidized form, the Cu/SrO catalysts was first reduced and showed high catalytic activity for transesterification and hydrogenation and hydrogenation selectivity toward the methyl linolenate without rising of methyl stearate (C18:0) in the one-pot process under the employed conditions. Compared with a reaction time of about 0.5h for completing the transesterification over SrO (Liu et al., 2007), the hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl esters over copper catalysts required much longer time (Nicoletta et al., 2002) since the copper catalysts should be reduced by hydrogen gas and the H2 molecular adsorbed by the copper site required to dissociate as well. Moreover, CuO also showed catalytic activity for transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol in the hydrogen atmosphere (see Table 1). So the catalytic actions of one-pot process combining the transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol and hydrogenation of hempseed oil for Cu/SrO may be rationalized in the following manner. The transesterification of the hempseed oils firstly took place on the mixed oxides of strontium and copper, producing methyl esters of hempseed oil, thereafter the selective hydrogenation of methyl esters occurred on the reduced copper species, obtaining selective hydrogenated hempseed oil methyl esters."
9,Fuel properties of hydrogenated methyl esters,"3.2 Fuel properties of hydrogenated methyl esters Biodiesel properties were largely determined by the composition of biodiesel, mainly including oleate (C18:1), linoleate (C18:2), linolenate (C18:3), stearate (C18: 0) and palmitate (C16:0) (Knothe, 2008). The relative rates of oxidation of oleate (C18:1), linoleate (C18:2), linolenate (C18:3) are 1:40:100, thus the decrease of linoleate (C18:2), linolenate (C18:3) and the increase of oleate (C18:1) will lead to a significant improvement of oxidative stability. Cetane number increases and NO x emissions decrease with decreasing degree of unsaturation (Mccormick et al., 2001; Frankel, 2005). On the other hand, a high content of fully saturated compounds (stearate (C18: 0) and palmitate (C16:0)) has a very negative impact on the cold properties of the fuel (cloud point, pour point and low-temperature filterability) (Knothe, 2008). So the decreases of poly-un-saturates such as linolenate (C18:3) and linoleate (C18:2) and the increase of oleate (C18:1) by the above selective hydrogenation will inevitably change the properties of biodiesel. Before and after selective hydrogenation, the fuel properties of hempseed oil methyl esters were determined with standard methods and compared to ASTM D 6751, EN 14214 and GB/T20828-2007 biodiesel standards, and the results are listed in Table 2 . The methyl esters and hydrogenated methyl esters showed a density of 0.872 and 0.876g/cm3, which are within the specification limits. The kinematic viscosity of methyl ester and hydrogenated methyl esters were found to be 4.23 and 4.31mm2/g at 40°C which met the requirements of biodiesel standards. The flash points of the biodiesel and hydrogenated biodiesel are 131 and 137°C, meeting specified limit of min. 130°C of ASTM D 6751 and GB/T20828-2007 and min. 120 of EN 14214. The acid numbers of the biodiesel and hydrogenated biodiesel of hempseed oil were 0.01mg KOH/g, well within the maximum limit of 0.5mg KOH/g biodiesel standards. With lower concentration of poly-unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters, the hydrogenated methyl esters of hempseed oil showed a lower iodine value (113), a higher cetane number (55.8), and a higher pour point (−12°C) with respect to iodine value of 164, cetane number of 44.0, and pour point of −15°C of methyl esters of hempseed oil, respectively, and these three fuel properties of hydrogenated methyl esters meet the responded specifications of biodiesel standards. Through the one-pot process, all of these tested parameters of hydrogenated biodiesels comply with the limits established by ASTM D 6751, EN 14214, and GB/T20828-2007. Moser et al. (2007) have evaluated a number of fuel properties of partially hydrogenated soybean oil methyl esters, including oxidative stability, low-temperature performance, lubricity, kinematic viscosity, and specific gravity. They found that partially hydrogenated soybean oil methyl esters had better oxidative stability, similar specific gravity, but inferior low-temperature properties, kinematic viscosity, and lubricity compared to conventional soybean oil methyl esters. The experimentally hydrogenated hempseed oil methyl esters obtained over Cu/SrO catalysts were evaluated as biodiesels by measuring the iodine values and cetane numbers. The hydrogenated hempseed oil methyl esters presented different amounts of monounsaturated, di-unsaturated and tri-unsaturated fatty acids methyl esters, which can be expressed by a degree of unsaturation (DU) parameter that was calculated from the following equation: DU = ( monounsaturated C 18 : 1 ; wt . % ) + 2 × ( di-unsaturated C 18 : 2 ; wt . % ) + 3 × ( tri-unsaturated C 18 : 3 ; wt . % ) The correlation between the iodine value, cetane number and the degree of unsaturation of the experimental hydrogenated hempseed oil methyl esters obtained over Cu/SrO catalysts was showed in Fig. 1 . As can be seen, the iodine value and cetane number fit linearly with the degree of unsaturation. The iodine value increases and the cetane number decreases with the increasing of degree of unsaturation. The iodine values of biodiesel largely decreased to lower than 120g I2/100g due to saturation of double bonds when the degree of unsaturation was reduced to lower than 138, making the biodiesels prepared meet the requirement of iodine value by EN 14214. Moreover, a proper degree of unsaturation with iodine value >113 could ensure proper cold-flow performances of biodiesels prepared, which can be supported by Federica et al. (2009) who presented pour point of −13°C for hydrogenated hempseed oil methyl esters with iodine value of 118I2/100g. The cetane number achieves 51 when degree of unsaturation decreases to 136, meeting the specifications of USA (ASTM D 6751), China (GB/T20828-2007) and European Organization (EN 14214), which set the minimum cetane number for biodiesel as 47, 49 and 51, respectively. The increased cetane numbers are associated with the rising of methyl oleate and the decreasing of poly-un-saturates such as methyl linolenate and methyl linoleate (Table 1). In a word, biodiesels prepared by one-pot process combining transesterification of hempseed oil and selective hydrogenation of hempseed oil methyl esters with a lower degree of unsaturation than 138 can meet European regulation as far as both iodine value and cetane number are concerned. It can thus be concluded that one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation is a feasible and effective method for the production of high quality biodiesel from hempseed oil which is a typical oil of high degree of unsaturation. The biodiesel from hempseed oil could be a competitive alternative to conventional diesel fuel."
10,Conclusions,"A one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation was developed for biodiesel production using hempseed oil having iodine values greater than 150g I2/100g as starting material. Strontium oxide supported copper oxide was demonstrated to be an effective bi-functional catalyst for the transesterification and selective hydrogenation to produce selective hydrogenated methyl esters as biodiesels meeting EN 14214 as far as IV and CN are concerned. This one-pot process gives the opportunity to extend the high un-saturate materials for biodiesel production, thus making a wide portfolio of raw materials available without interfering with the food market."
