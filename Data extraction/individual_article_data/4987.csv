0,Introduction,"Inexpensive feedstock containing sufficient organic material is essential for making H2 fermentation feasible [1]. Organic solid waste is a major environmental burden due to growing environmental awareness and public health concerns. It has the potential to be a plentiful and negative-value feedstock for H2 production. In recent years, successful continuous H2 production from various types of organic solid waste has been reported [2–7]. However, the design parameters for a continuous flow organic solid waste reactor have yet to be clearly defined. The solids retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) are important design parameters in biological processes. The SRT determines the substrate uptake efficiency, microbial population, and metabolic pathway. In H2 fermentation, it is generally assumed that a high SRT causes the growth of H2 consumers, including methanogens, and competitors for substrates, such as non-H2-producing acidogens [8]. Therefore, an SRT in the range of 8–12h is considered the general operational condition for continuous H2 production from glucose or sucrose [9]. On the other hand, a low SRT may reduce substrate uptake efficiency, active biomass retention, and therefore, the overall process efficiency [10]. Furthermore, in the case of complex substrates such as organic solid waste, a higher SRT may be required due to the slowly degradable organic compounds [3,7,11]. However, little is known about the effects of SRT on H2 fermentation of organic solid waste independent of HRT, because most previous studies used continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) systems [2–6]. HRT determines the economics of the process, independent of SRT. For a given volume of waste, a lower HRT means a smaller reactor and therefore decreased cost. If the optimum level of SRT could be provided at a low HRT, it would enhance the productivity and technical feasibility of the H2 production process. This aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SRT on the continuous H2 fermentation of organic solid waste, independent of HRT. Food waste, which accounts for 26.8% of the municipal solid waste in South Korea [12] amounting to about 12,977tonnes/day—was used at the feedstock. Four anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs) were operated for 84–130 days, with the SRT and HRT controlled in the ranges of 24–160h and 24–42h, respectively. The possibility of using H2 fermentation as an organic solid waste treatment process was also evaluated."
1,Material and methods,
2,Seed sludge and feedstock,"2.1 Seed sludge and feedstock Seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester at Daejeon municipal wastewater treatment plant in South Korea. The digester was operated at 35°C at an HRT (SRT) of 25 days, and fed a mixture of primary and secondary sludge. The pH, alkalinity, and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentrations of the sludge were 7.6, 2.83gCaCO3/L, and 5.5g/L, respectively. The sludge was heat-treated at 90°C for 10min to deactivate any bioactivity of H2 consumers. Food waste was obtained from a cafeteria at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. Analysis conducted after the bones and clamshells were removed showed that on a total solids (TS) basis, it was composed mainly of grains (36.3±1.8%), vegetables (45.8±2.7%), meat (12.2±2.3%), and fish (4.6±0.5%). After grinding in a garbage disposal unit (Waste King Gourmet model 1001; Anaheim Manufacturing), we found that about 96.4% of the dried ground particles could pass through US sieve #8 (2.38mm). The concentration of volatile solids (VS) in the ground food waste was 16.1±0.9%. We adjusted the pH to 12.5 using 6M KOH (average 3.0mmolOH−/g of VS) and agitated it at 30rpm for 24h under anaerobic conditions to enhance the hydrolysis of particulate organics and reduce the potential propagation of H2 consumers [13–15]. Then, we added enough tap water to maintain the carbohydrate concentration at 27.0g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L (average VS 4.4%) [16,17]. We added iron in the form of FeCl2 4H2O to maintain a level of 10mgFe/L [18]. The resulting feedstock characteristics were as follows: TS 4.6±0.3%, VS 4.4±0.2%, VSS 20.6±1.5g/L, total COD 44.2±2.3g/L, soluble COD 21.9±1.3g/L, soluble carbohydrate 12.6±1.0gCOD/L, total Kjeldahl nitrogen 1.1gN/L, total organic acid 3.6±0.5gCOD/L, total alcohol 0.4±0.1gCOD/L, pH 11.8±0.3, and alkalinity 4.8±0.3gCaCO3/L."
3,Reactor operation,"2.2 Reactor operation We constructed four identical ASBRs each with a working volume of 4.5L (liquid depth of 200mm and inner diameter of 170mm), operated in a room where the temperature was maintained at 35±1°C. Each ASBR was connected to a water displacement unit filled with acidified-saturated salt solution to measure biogas production. Two of the four reactors were inoculated with 1.35L of the heat-treated sludge, and filled with the feedstock to the working volume. The headspace of the reactors was flushed with N2 gas for 1min, and then the reactors were agitated at 200rpm. When cumulative H2 production was equivalent to 0.5molH2/molhexoseadded, the reactors were put into sequencing batch feed mode, going through three 8-h batches per day of feeding, reaction, and drawing phases. The feeding and drawing were controlled by an automatic pump. As the volume of biogas in the water displacement unit was maintained larger than the drawn volume, the gas phase of the reactors was kept anaerobic. The HRT (reactor volume divided by influent flow rate) was maintained at 24h in reactor 1 and at 30h in reactor 2. The reactors were agitated continuously at 200rpm without settling before the drawing phase to maintain the SRT equal to the HRT. The pH of the mixed liquor was maintained at a level greater than 5.3±0.1 by adding 3M KOH [18]. After a start-up period, the mixed liquor from reactors 1 and 2 was used to seed reactors 3 and 4 with designated HRTs of 36 and 42h, respectively. We operated all four reactors for at least 20 days, and then conducted further runs with increasing SRTs up to 120–160h independent of the HRT. In these cases, a settling phase was introduced between the reaction phase and the drawing phase to allow separation of the liquids and solids. We stopped the agitation and pH control during the settling and drawing phases. As there was no waste sludge, the SRT is defined as (1) θ c = θ X X e where θ c is the SRT, θ the HRT, X the VSS in the mixed liquor, and X e is the VSS in the effluent. As the concentrated solids often floated during the settling phase due to internal gassing, a higher operating SRT than HRT was maintained by adjusting the settling time and the drawing level by changing the relative height of the drawing port with respect to the depth of mixed liquor. The settling time and the drawing level were readjusted three times per week. In most cases, the target SRT was reached within 7 days with a margin of error of ±20%. Table 1 summarizes the phase cycle times and the drawing level for each operating condition. In all cases, the operating period was greater than 20 days, and steady (±10%) H2 production was maintained for at least 3 consecutive days before measuring the performance data."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The measured biogas production was corrected to standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (760mmHg) (STP). The H2, CH4, N2, and CO2 contents of the biogas were determined using a gas chromatograph, while the organic acids and aliphatic alcohols were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography [17]. The solids, COD, VSS, Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia, and alkalinity were quantified according to standard methods [19]. Total and soluble carbohydrates were determined using the phenol–sulfuric acid method [20]."
5,Results,
6,Production of hydrogen,"3.1 Production of hydrogen Production of H2 reached steady-state (±10%) within 22 days in reactor 1 (24h HRT) and reactor 2 (30h HRT). Reactor 3 (36h HRT) and reactor 4 (42h HRT), which had been seeded with the mixed liquor from the other two reactors, also showed stable H2 production within 10 days. When the SRT was the same as the HRT, the maximum H2 production (0.91LH2/(Ld) or 25.8mLH2/gVSadded) was observed at an HRT of 30h (35gVS/(Ld) organic loading rate). However, the maximum yield was lower than the maximum H2 production potential of the same food waste (60.1mLH2/gVSadded) using non-acclimated inoculum in a previous batch test [16]. Furthermore, the H2 production based on hexoseadded was 0.36molH2/molhexoseadded, which was lower than the typical reported potential of organic solid waste materials (0.6–2.3molH2/molhexoseadded) [21]. Therefore, we conducted further runs with increased SRTs. Table 2 shows that this attempt was successful. In all of the reactors, H2 production increased where the SRT was higher than the HRT. The methane content of the biogas was below the limit of detection (0.06%). To evaluate the influence of SRT and HRT on the production rate of H2, the data in Table 2 were subjected to response surface methodology (RSM). The following regression equation was obtained with a regression coefficient of 0.9366 by removing an insignificant term (P >0.01): (2) H 2 production rate = − 7.2239 + 0.0495 ( SRT ) + 0.4654 ( HRT ) − 0.0002 ( SRT ) 2 − 0.0079 ( HRT ) 2 The calculated values of F (44.2961) were greater than F 0.01,4,12 =5.41 (first kind risk α =1%), which meant that this was a statistically significant regression model [22]. The contour plots described by the regression model are shown in Fig. 1 (a). The maximum H2 production rate (2.73LH2/(Ld)) was found at an SRT of 126h and HRT of 30h (35gVS/(Ld) organic loading rate). The calculated maximum value was very close to the observed maximum of 2.72LH2/(Ld). The maximum H2 production rate was comparable to other reported maximum values (0.42–5.40LH2/(Ld)) in continuous H2 production using organic solid waste, as shown in Table 3 . The high H2 production rate was due to achieving the optimum SRT at a relatively low optimum HRT. Furthermore, Fig. 1(a) illustrates that the H2 production rate for an HRT in the range 24–35h was higher than 2.2LH2/(Ld) (equivalent to 80% of the maximum value) with the corresponding SRT in the wide range of 90–160h. In a practical field application, the precise control of SRT may be difficult due to the fluctuation of waste flow and the waste characteristics. However, the results shown in Fig. 1(a) suggest that only moderate control of SRT is necessary to achieve a high H2 production rate. In a similar way, we performed RSM to evaluate the effects of SRT and HRT on the H2 yield, and obtained this equation with a regression coefficient of 0.9310: (3) H 2 production yield = − 294.4371 + 1.4008 ( SRT ) + 17.6722 ( HRT ) − 0.0055 ( SRT ) 2 − 0.2724 ( HRT ) 2 The calculated values of F (40.4969) were larger than F 0.01,4,12 =5.41 (first kind risk α =1%). The contour plots described by the regression model are shown in Fig. 1(b). The maximum H2 yield (80.9mLH2/gVSadded and 1.12molH2/molhexoseadded) was estimated at an SRT of 126h and HRT of 33h (32gVS/(Ld) organic loading rate). The calculated maximum was near the observed maximum of 81.1mLH2/gVS. The optimum HRT of 33h for the maximum yield was slightly higher than optimal HRT of 30h for the maximum rate. However, the optimum SRT was the same for both. The maximum H2 yield was comparable to the reported maximum values (22.6–189.5mLH2/gVS) in continuous processes fed with organic solid waste (Table 3) and even the reported maximum values (0.7–2.5molH2/molhexoseadded) from a continuous operation fed with glucose or sucrose [8,17,18]. Fig. 1(b) also shows that the H2 yield for an HRT range of 27–38h was greater than 65mLH2/gVS (equivalent to 80% of the maximum value) with the corresponding SRT in the wide range of 90–160h."
7,Production of soluble byproducts,"3.2 Production of soluble byproducts Organic matter in food waste was converted to H2, soluble byproducts (organic acids and alcohols), and biomass through H2 fermentation. The conversion of food waste to organic acids and alcohols would enhance the reduction of waste volume and production of methane in a subsequent methanogenic stage [2–4]. Organic acids and alcohols also have great potential for use as a readily biodegradable carbon source for denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment [13,23–25]. Furthermore, they could also be used as liquid fuel, a high-value product [26]. Table 4 shows that total organic acid concentration after fermentation and the conversion efficiency corrected with influent organic acids were in the range of 15.6–22.4gCOD/L and 29.6–46.3% on a COD basis, respectively. The organic acid conversion efficiency was comparable to the values reported for the non-H2-producing acid fermentation of food waste (20.4–32.0%) [13,24,25]. The total alcohol concentration and conversion efficiency were in the range of 2.2–9.3gCOD/L and 4.1–14.6%, respectively. Another useful parameter for evaluating solid waste fermentation is the VSS removal efficiency, because hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step in the degradation of insoluble substrate. The VSS removal efficiency in this study was in the range of 54.9–75.8%, which was comparable to the reported values for the non-H2-producing acid fermentation of food waste (49.3–60.8%) [13,24,25]. This implies that continuous H2 fermentation could be a substitute for the conventional acidogenic reaction with the additional benefits of H2 production. Soluble byproducts in the effluent were composed mainly of acetate, propionate, n-butyrate, lactate, ethanol, and isopropanol. Trace amounts of formate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, n-caproate, n-propanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, and sec-butanol were also detected [each trace byproduct <1% of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD)]. Among these, n-butyrate has been reported as the most important indicator of H2 production [18]. However, the distribution of byproducts for high SRTs in this study showed an unusual trend. As the H2 production increased under SRT control, the n-butyrate concentration decreased in all the reactors, although it was the most abundant organic acid in all conditions. The concentration of acetate did not show any consistent relationship to SRT in our experiments. Furthermore, it was almost impossible to estimate the contribution of acetate production to the production of H2 due to reductive acetogenesis from H2 and CO2 [27,28]. Instead, isopropanol concentration increased with H2 production at high values of SRT in our experiments. At an SRT greater than 60h, the isopropanol concentration was in the range of 2.7–7.3gCOD/L. Unlike other alcohols such as ethanol and butanol, 1mol of isopropanol could be produced along with 3mol of H2 from 1mol of hexose as shown in Eq. (4) [29]: (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 4 H 2 O → C H 3 CH ( OH ) C H 3 + 3 HC O 3 − + 3 H + + 3 H 2 , Δ G 0 = − 200 kJ / mol Isopropanol is a useful and biodegradable chemical as are the other byproducts [30]. Carbohydrate catabolism to isopropanol has been reported in clostridial fermentation, although the frequency was lower than for n-butyrate, acetate, lactate, and ethanol [29,31]. The feedstock characteristics or the increased SRT used in this study may contribute to the mechanism of H2 production. The concentration of propionate, a product of H2 consumption, was kept below 2.3gCOD/L. The increase in lactate, a reduced end product, was observed at high values of SRT. However, the decrease in ethanol, another reduced end product, had a compensatory effect."
8,Discussion,"Although an increase in SRT could enhance biomass retention and provide sufficient time for hydrolysis of insoluble substrates, this has not generally been used as an operational strategy in H2 fermentation of organic solid waste, due to the possibility of the prevalence of methanogens and non-methanogenic H2-consuming or non-H2-producing acidogens [8,9]. However, this study demonstrated that a high SRT using internal sludge retention would be beneficial to H2 fermentation without the unwanted microbial reactions. Methane was not detected at high SRTs up to 160h. Table 4 also shows that the increase in SRT did not cause the prevalence of non-methanogenic H2-consuming or non-H2-producing reactions, such as the production of propionate, reduced end products (lactate, ethanol, and butanol), and acetate (via reductive acetogenesis from H2 and CO2). Using an ASBR facilitated internal sludge retention. The reactor configuration is also suitable for treating organic solid waste, unlike other high-rate configurations, such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. Some previous researchers have considered ASBRs inappropriate for H2 production because the low substrate concentration near the end of a cycle in sequenced batch operations could cause a population shift to non-H2-producing acidogens [32]. It has also been reported that the substrate affinity of H2-producing bacteria was lower than those of other anaerobic bacteria [33]. However, Table 2 shows that carbohydrate concentration just before the decant phase was no less than 3.6gCOD/L when the H2 yield was higher than 25.8mLH2/gVSadded. This was sufficiently high to prevent the population shift to non-H2-producing bacteria [17]. The low pH was regarded as another inhibitor of methanogens, propionate production, and reductive acetogenesis from H2 and CO2 [20,27]. As the feedstock had its pH initially adjusted, the pH value at the start of the sequencing cycles was in the range of 6.3–6.6. However, organic acid production decreased the pH to 5.3±0.1 within 1h. As shown in Table 2, the VSS in the mixed liquor increased as SRT increased, which may have been related to the enhanced H2 production through retention of active H2-producing bacteria. In H2 fermentation using mixed cultures, the increase in total biomass does not always accompany the increase in H2 production due to microbial population changes [8,10,20]. However, in this study, appropriate operating conditions, including pH and carbohydrate concentration, suppressed these unwanted phenomena. The increase in SRT also enhanced the VSS removal efficiency, as shown in Table 4, which confirmed that high the SRT provided sufficient time for hydrolysis of insoluble substrates. This study showed that achieving high SRT rather than HRT by internal sludge retention could be a useful operational strategy for the H2 fermentation of organic solid waste."
