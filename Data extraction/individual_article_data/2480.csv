0,Introduction,"Currently, it is essential to develop clean and sustainable energy systems in order to overcome the issues, and it is expected that hydrogen energy will play a key role to meet the demands in the future energy requirement [1]. Hydrogen is an ultimate clean energy and can be used directly or indirectly like conventional fuels or fuel cells powered energy conversion [2,3]. At present, hydrogen is mainly produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas by steam reforming [4–6]. As fossil fuels are depleting rapidly, it is indispensable to find an alternative system to meet the energy demands. The photocatalytic water splitting using solar light energy is one of the best alternatives among the available methods due to abundant water sources and unlimited energy from sunlight [7–11]. However, the photocatalytic performance is mainly dependant on the physicochemical properties of a photocatalyst, nature of active sites (cocatalyst), and the reaction conditions, etc [12–15]. So far, variety of materials such as transition metal oxides, metal sulfides, mixed metal oxides, metal-free semiconductors, and doped semiconductors have been explored as photocatalysts for hydrogen production [8,12,16–18]. But, achieving the desired efficiency in photocatalytic hydrogen production is challenging due to undesired photoexcited charge recombination. For improving the charge separation, noble metals, non-noble metals have been used as cocatalysts, recently composited materials such as core-shell materials, quantum dots, binary, ternary composites, and non-metal semiconductors such as g-C3N4 based materials have got much attention [19–22]. However, the resulting efficiency is still inefficient for large-scale applications. To find an efficient and durable photocatalyst, so far, our group has designed and worked on different types of systems [23–27]. Recently, it is reported that the interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) and multicharge transfer will suppress the charge recombination and improves the activity [20,28,29]. Rao et al. illustrated the importance and effect of Cu-based semiconductors in the photocatalytic water splitting process. Especially, cupper (CuO, Cu2O, CuS, Cu2S, and CuSe2, etc.) based composites have got attracted much due to their tunable optical properties. Here, Cu is an earth-abundant material, and its oxides and chalcogenides will greatly affect the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors. Among them, Cu2S is potential material to absorb visible light as it exhibits a bandgap of 1.5–2.1 eV [26,30–32]. On the other hand, CdS and Ta2O5 are well-attracted materials for photocatalytic applications in which CdS will have a narrow bandgap of 2.2–2.7 eV, and Ta2O5 will exhibit a wide bandgap (3.4–3.9 eV). Especially CdS got much attention due to its favorable band positions (VB and CB) to produce hydrogen via photocatalytic water splitting reaction [8,14,31,33]. And the Ta2O5 is highly stable and has remarkable usage in gas sensors, photovoltaic devices, and electronic industries because of its high dielectric and refractive coefficient. Recently, Ta2O5 has been regarded as a typical active photocatalyst for photocatalytic water splitting reaction. But its wide bandgap limits its conversion efficiency [34,35]. Moreover, the formation of ternary composite got much attention due to the existence of interfacial charge transfer. Liu et al. illustrated the design and working mechanism of ternary composites g-C3N4/CdS/NiS and g-C3N4/CNT/NiS [36], in which the activity of the binary systems has been gradually increased with the addition of NiS as electron sink via interfacial charge transfer process. Younis et al. demonstrated an improved photocatalytic activity by constructing a ά-MoO3–WO3/CdS ternary nanocomposite [37]. Very recently, Tang et al. established rationally designed CdS/TiO2 coupled with 1T-MoS2 [38], in which 1T-MoS2 introduced to form a novel ternary heterojunction with CdS/TiO2 and displayed a 35-fold better rate of H2 production compared to binary system CdS/TiO2. In addition to this, the morphology of materials will greatly influence the performance of photocatalysts due to their unique properties like the flow of electrons along the 1-D axis due to confinement effect, the number of available active sites, and effective charge separation of electron/hole [39–42]. Several reports undoubtedly proved that 1-D and 2-D materials would show a higher rate of hydrogen production compared to other morphologies. Ogale et al. described the enhancement of H2 evolution using the morphology-controlled ternary nanocomposite g-C3N4(2D)/CdS(1D)/rGO (2D) [43]. Here, due to the 1D morphology, the activity of 1D-CdS is higher than spherical CdS, and it was further increased by coupling with 2D-g-C3N4 and 2D-rGO. Based on the reports, the integration of exceptional properties of Cu2S, Ta2O5, and CdS by formation of ternary nanocomposites can provide a novel heterojunctioned photocatalyst. And, it is presumed that the energetically matched band–band phenomenon with exceptional photostability of the ternary photocatalyst will help to achieve the target application. Here, we synthesized the six petals structured Cu2S using a solvothermal method with slight modifications from the report, which stated that the amine-based solvents would drive the morphology of nanomaterials at various concentrations with a prolonged reaction time effectively. Parallel to the same, 1D-CdS nanorods and Ta2O5 nanoparticles were prepared for nanocomposite formation, followed by a series of CdS/Ta2O5 composites that were prepared to investigate the rate of hydrogen evolution and noted that the performance of CdS NRs was improved with Ta2O5 heterojunction. Here, the Ta2O5 plays a role as an electron sink for the photoinduced electrons transferred from the conduction band of CdS under visible light irradiation [35,35,44,44]. Thereafter, the prepared CdS/Ta2O5 binary composite has been sensitized by coupling with six-petal Cu2S to scrutinize the influence of Cu2S over the CdS/Ta2O5 composite and found that the rate of hydrogen generation was greatly triggered by Cu2S. The observed amount of hydrogen produced is about 131 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat that is threefold better than pristine CdS NRs (46 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat) and twofold higher than CdS/Ta2O5 (65 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat) composite. The calculated visible light to hydrogen conversion efficiency for the optimized system is 5.6%. The morphology of Cu2S and CdS might be playing a critical role in the enhanced rate of hydrogen generation. The structural and chemical stability of the recovered catalyst after five cycles of activity was also studied using HR-TEM and XPS analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research about the synthetic strategy for such ternary photocatalyst till now. Therefore, the combinatorial rational design is an effective strategy for the development of a novel heterostructure composite consisting of Cu2S, Ta2O5, and CdS nanomaterials for solar harvesting. The reaction variables such as weight loading and sacrificial system with pH were scrutinized and optimized to achieve better photocatalytic performance and durability."

3,Synthesis of CdS nanorods,"2.2 Synthesis of CdS nanorods The CdS nanorods were synthesized using the hydrothermal method [45,46]. In a typical synthesis, 0.8 mmol (4.39 gm) CdCl2 and 0.8 mmol (1.8 gm) CH4N2S were dissolved in 30 mL of DI water in two separate beakers. After the dissolution at room temperature, the thiourea solution was added dropwise to cadmium chloride solution followed by 35 mL of ethylenediamine (En) was added into the mixture and transferred into a 100 mL capacity Teflon-lined autoclave. After the reaction at 180 °C for 12 h, the obtained products were washed several times with deionized (DI) water and ethanol, followed by drying in a hot air oven at 80 °C for 12 h."
4,Synthesis of six-petal structured Cu2S nanoparticles,"2.3 Synthesis of six-petal structured Cu2S nanoparticles We adopted the hydrothermal method to synthesize the six-petal structured Cu2S nanoparticles [47]. Herein, 2:1 M ratio of thiourea (4.86 g, 1.06 M) and copper chloride dihydrate (5.64 g, 0.53 M) was dissolved in 30 mL of ethylenediamine separately and sequentially added together under constant magnetic stirring (20 min) at room temperature. The resultant solution mixture (60 mL) was transferred and sealed in a 100 mL capacity Teflon lined autoclave and subjected to heating in an electric oven under vacuum at 180 °C for 18 h. The resultant precipitate was collected and washed with DI water and ethanol for few times. Finally, the obtained black-colored material was dried in a hot air oven at 80 °C for 12 h."

TaCl5 (1.8 g, 0.5 M) was dissolved in 10 mL of absolute ethanol followed by drop-wise addition of 1 mL diethanolamine (1 M) as a hydrolysing agent. The solution was magnetically stirred continuously for 24 h and left as such for 5 h to form the two layers (supernatant and precipitate). The supernate was discarded, and the precipitate was washed and dried at 80 °C. The obtained powder was calcined at 700 °C for 4 hunder Argon gas flow."
6,Preparation of Cu2S/Ta2O5/CdS photocatalyst,"2.5 Preparation of Cu2S/Ta2O5/CdS photocatalyst Step-1: Preparation of CdS/Ta 2 O 5 photocatalyst. The composited photocatalyst was prepared using the impregnation method [28,49]. In a typical process, the calculated amount of (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 wt%) Ta2O5 with respect to CdS NRs weight were weighed and dispersed in 20 mL of an ethanol-water mixture (10 mL each) and subjected to 90 °C under constant stirring. The obtained composited photocatalysts were labeled as CT-5, CT-7.5, CT-10, CT-12.5, and CT-15, corresponding to 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 wt% of Ta2O5, respectively. Step-2: Preparation of Cu 2 S sensitized CdS/Ta 2 O 5 photocatalyst (Cu 2 S/Ta 2 O 5 /CdS). The optimized binary composite photocatalyst (CT-10) consists of 90 wt % CdS and 10 wt % Ta2O5 was chosen to design ternary nanocomposite photocatalysts. The calculated amount of CT-10 and (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 wt%) Cu2S were mixed using mortar and pestle by simple physical mixing and labeled as CT-10/CS-5, CT-10/CS-7.5, CT-10/CS-10, CT-10/CS-12.5, and CT-10/CS-15."
7,Characterizations,2.6 Characterizations The details of analytical techniques employed to characterize the prepared ternary nanocomposite materials were described in supporting information (SI).
8,Solar photocatalytic activity,"2.7 Solar photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic experiments have been carried out in a Kjeldahl flask-shaped reactor made up of quartz (Volume 185 mL), having a single port for charging and discharging the reaction components and sealed with specially made rubber septum to ensure that gas was leak-proof. In a typical experiment, 20 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed into 50 mL of the reaction mixture consists of 45 mL DI water and 5 mL of lactic acid as a sacrificial agent. In order to ensure the effective dispersion of the catalyst and to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium, the reactor charged with reactants were subjected to ultrasonication and magnetic stirring under dark conditions for 30 min. Further, the reactor was sealed with a rubber septum and evacuated, followed by purging with N2 gas to provide a hydrogen/oxygen-free atmosphere. Now, the quartz reactor was illuminated with 250W QTH lamp, which produces high-intensity visible light (quartz tungsten halogen, Oriel corporation model 66183) under constant stirring. The evolved hydrogen was quantified at 1-h regular interval using Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2014) equipped with TCD detector and molecular sieves 5 Å column with N2 as carrier gas. In order to study the durability of photocatalyst, the experiments have been continued up to 5 cycles duration of 20 h. The effect of catalyst loading and the role of different sacrificial reagents have been studied."
9,Results and discussions,
10,Methodology for the synthesis of shape-controlled nanostructures,"3.1 Methodology for the synthesis of shape-controlled nanostructures 3.1.1 Formation mechanism of cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanorods Generally, the solvent-assisted hydrothermal method is a well-known process for the preparation of nanostructures with controlled morphologies. Ethylenediamine has been widely used as a capping ligand for the synthesis of CdS nanostructures with various morphologies such as nanoflakes, nanowires, nanorods, and nanospheres. From the reports, it is evidenced that the variation in the concentration of ethylenediamine in water influences the growth mechanism of CdS nanostructures [45], and thus, we have employed a 50% of ethylenediamine in water media at high temperature with prolonged reaction time to prepare cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanorods. The formation mechanism is as follows. At the initial step, Cd2+ ions in the solution react with ethylenediamine to form its complex ions [Cd (en)]2+ in the existence of H2O. (1) C d 2 + + 2 e n + 2 H 2 O → [ C d ( e n ) 2 ( H 2 O ) 2 ] 2 + (2) S C ( N H 2 ) 2 + 2 H 2 O → S 2 − + 2 H + + C O 2 ↑ + 2 N H 3 ↑ (3) [ C d ( e n ) 2 ( H 2 O ) 2 ] 2 + ↔ C d 2 + ( l o w c o n c e n t r a t i o n ) + 2 e n + 2 H 2 O (4) C d 2 + ( l o w c o n c e n t r a t i o n ) + S 2 − → C d S ( n a n o r o d s ) With the increase of temperature up to 12h, the reaction between water and thiourea generates S2− and bubbles of CO2 and NH3 as shown in Eq. (2), which makes the complex [Cd (en)2(H2O)2]2+ become highly stable, with the result that Cd2+ concentration in the solution will be lowered (Eq. (3)). In the bubble-liquid interface, the decreased Cd2+ ions can induce the quasi-equilibrium growth of CdS nanorods on the surface of spherical nanoparticles (Eq. (4)). 3.1.2 Preparation of six-petal structured Cu2S nanoparticles A copper precursor was dissolved in ethylenediamine (En), which forms complex via chelation with the bidentate arms of En as shown in Scheme-1 . At a higher temperature and pressure, a major part of Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+ [47], and it is important to note that the stability of the complex [Cu(en)n]+ is also very high [k = 1010.8]. After a certain time (18 h) of reaction at elevated temperature and pressure, the stability of the complex decreased, and the dissociation of thiourea produces S2− by releasing the by-product gases as discussed in the above synthesis. Generated S2− immediately reacted with the Cu+ ions to form six-petal structured Cu2S nanoparticles via a diffusion-limited monomer-cluster aggregation [50]. However, at various concentrations, with time, the morphology tuner ethylenediamine plays a key role in tuning the shape of prepared nanostructures."
11,Characterization of photocatalysts,"3.2 Characterization of photocatalysts The XRD pattern of prepared materials and nanocomposite photocatalyst are shown in Fig. 1 . The high-intensity peaks shown in Fig. 1(a) at 25, 26.6, 28.2, and 43.7° are correlated with the (100), (002), (101), and (110) planes of CdS nanorods, respectively, and which are well matched with JCPDS No: 077–2306. In Fig. 1(b), the peaks located at 32.3, 46, and 54.7° are corresponding to (200), (110), and (111) planes of six-petal structured Cu2S, respectively, which are in good agreement with JCPDS No: 003–1071. Fig. 1(c) depicts the (001), (110), and (111) planes of Ta2O5 NPs corresponding to the 2θ values of 23, 28.5, and 36.7° (JCPDS No: 018–1304). Fig. 1(d) shows the diffracted pattern of CT-10/CS-10 composite where it could be clearly seen that XRD lines corresponding to CdS are very predominant, and the lines corresponding to Cu2S and Ta2O5 are feeble. Here, It is important to mention that due to the presence of very low proportion and uniform distribution, few major lines corresponding to Ta2O5 and Cu2S are only identified [51]. However, the presence of Cu2S and Ta2O5 in the ternary nanocomposite was confirmed using SEM-EDX and TEM elemental mapping analysis. Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology of prepared photocatalysts. Fig. 2(a–b) clearly confirms the six-petal structure of Cu2S nanoparticles. The observed surface morphology strongly proved that the ethylenediamine played a key role in the six petals formation [45,47]. On account of this type of morphology, the active surface area and migration of charged species of Cu2S is gradually increased, which can influence photocatalytic activity. Fig. 2(c) confirms the rod-like structured CdS nanoparticles, and this 1-Dimensional structure will differ the photocatalytic performance from other forms of CdS [52]. Fig. 2(d) shows the surface morphology of Ta2O5 nanoparticles. Fig. 2(e–f) demonstrates the SEM morphology and SEM-EDX of composite photocatalyst (CT-10/CS-10), which confirms the presence of Cu2S and Ta2O5 branched with CdS NRs. For further confirmation, we recorded HR-TEM images at different locations that confirm the uniform distribution of Ta2O5 and Cu2S nanoparticles and branched with pristine CdS nanorods (Fig. 3 (a–b)). In Fig. 3(c), the calculated d-space values of 0.19, 0.33, and 0.54 nm from the SAED pattern of the ternary nanocomposite were correlated with the values obtained from the X-ray diffraction pattern of Cu2S, CdS, and Ta2O5, respectively. From the results, it could be concluded that the marked planes (220), (002), and (111) are in good agreement with the planes that exist for Cu2S, Ta2O5, and CdS in the XRD pattern, respectively. Fig. 3(d) shows the HAADF image of CT-10/CS-10, in which we can clearly notice the presence of composited materials at the appropriate locations. Fig. 4 (a–f) depicts the individual elemental mapping of Cu, Cd, S, Ta, and O, which are uniformly present in the photocatalyst (CT-10/CS-10), and it clearly confirms the presence of Ta2O5 and Cu2S together branched with CdS nanorods. Consequently, the optical properties and transient photocurrent responses of the prepared materials were recorded and described in supporting information Fig. S1, S2 and S3. The chemical states of the prepared CT-10/CS-10 ternary photocatalyst displayed in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5(a) shows the full survey spectrum of the optimized photocatalyst CT-10/CS-10. In Fig. 5(b), the two major peaks at 405.2 and 412.0 eV attributes to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2. Fig. 5(c) shows two peaks at 932.4 eV and 952.2 eV that correspond to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, which confirms that the copper existed in the +1 oxidation state. In addition to this, a weak satellite peak around 140 eV confirms the existence of Cu in the +1 oxidation state. Fig. 5(d) reveals S2p spectrum and the two major peaks observed at 160.4 and 161.6 eV are the representations of S2p3/2 and S2p1/2, which confirms the existence of sulfur in S2− form. These binding energy values will strongly confirm the existence of Cu2S and CdS [26,30]. The peaks at 26.2 eV and 28.1 eV in Fig. 5(e) attributed to Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2 evidences the presence of Ta in +5 state. Finally, the peaks at 529 and 530.3 eV corresponding to O1s reveal the existence of O2− valence state, as shown in Fig. 5(f). The binding energy values of the elements (Cd, Cu, S, Ta, and O), which are present in the optimized photocatalyst are in good agreement with the standard values [53]."
12,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity,"3.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity To evaluate the photocatalytic performance, optimum catalyst dosage with a suitable sacrificial system is essential. Various types of sacrificial reagents such as alcohols, sulfur-based inorganic compounds, amines, and acids were usually added in optimum quantities into the water to improve the H+ generation [54,55]. Hence, the different sacrificial systems and catalyst loading have been evaluated with the CdS NRs photocatalyst for better hydrogen production. Fig. 6 shows the performance of pristine CdS NRs with lactic acidic triethanolamine (TEOA), 1:1 M of Na2S and Na2SO3 sacrificial systems, and effect of catalyst loading to the solution. In Fig. 6(a), the lactic acid-based sacrificial system showed better hydrogen evolution compared to amine and sulfur-based systems. However, the rate of H+ generation will influence the rate of hydrogen evolution during reaction [55]. The detailed thermodynamic process of the photocatalytic reactions with different sacrificial solutions has been clearly discussed in the supplementary information. Hence, we concluded that, compared to TEOA and sulfur-based sacrificial reagent systems, the lactic acid system could deliver a better rate of H+ generation that leads to enhanced hydrogen evolution. On the other hand, the pH of the solution also affects the rate of hydrogen production. Here, the pH of the solutions at the same experimental conditions has been measured and noted as approximately 3.5 for lactic acid, 8 for TEOA, and 12 for (Na2S + Na2SO3), which are indicated in Fig. 6(a). In the acidic media at pH = 3.5, the photocatalyst surfaces carry a positive charge, which electrostatically attracts negatively charged species generated by scavengers [56,57]. Thus, more efficient hole trapping by the electron donors should increase the photocatalytic activity. In order to optimize the amount of catalyst loading to the sacrificial reagent system for a better rate of hydrogen generation, the pristine CdS NRs performance was studied by loading 5, 20, 50, and 100 mg of catalyst (Fig. 6(b)). A high rate of hydrogen evolution about 46 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat was observed for 20 mg of catalyst. At the minimum amount of catalyst dosage, the observed rate of hydrogen production is low, which is proportional to the number of active sites, and while increasing the catalyst dosage, the hydrogen evolution was increased up to optimum level and then decreased. On further increasing the amount of catalyst loading, the hydrogen production activity lowered due to poor light penetration by the suspended particles since 20 mg catalyst is optimum for these experimental conditions. In consequence of the above optimization, the performance of CdS/Ta2O5 heterojunction has been studied. Fig. 6(c) shows the influence of Ta2O5 nanoparticles on improving the photocatalytic performance of CdS NRs. A high rate of hydrogen production of about 65 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat was observed for 10 wt% of Ta2O5 loaded photocatalyst. Here, due to the wide bandgap (3.52 eV), Ta2O5 is UV light active material, but it can play a cocatalyst role by forming a heterojunction with CdS, and triggers the charge transfer process and reduces the H+ into H2. Li.et al. reported that Ta2O5 will act as a cocatalyst under visible light irradiation due to the heterojunction formed between g-C3N4/Ta2O5 and will reduce the accumulation of electrons at the conduction band of CdS. Then the collected electrons are utilized to reduce the H+ into H2 molecules [35]. Moreover, owing to the 1-D morphology of CdS, the flow of electrons will be driven in one direction helps to suppress the photoexcited charge recombination, and due to the variation in the morphology, the observed rate of hydrogen production was too high compared to the same system reported by Gaun et al., [44]. However, the activity of CdS/Ta2O5 composition was linearly increased with increasing the wt% of Ta2O5 up to 10 wt% and decreased on further increment. It is due to the creation of more external surface states that will act as recombination centers, and a large amount of Ta2O5 NPs on the CdS surface will reduce the light absorption capacity of CdS, which results in lower hydrogen production [58]. Furthermore, the effect of six-petal structured Cu2S over the photocatalytic activity of optimized photocatalyst (CT-10) was studied in detail to understand the interfacial charge transfer process. Cu2S is a visible light active material due to its lower bandgap (1.5 eV), possesses high surface area because of the six-petal morphology, and it can affect the performance of photocatalyst greatly [30]. The conduction band of Cu2S is more negative than the conduction band of CdS and can act as a photosensitizer. Thus, owing to the addition of photosensitizer to the CdS/Ta2O5 nanocomposite, the number of photoexcited charge carriers will be increased, and their migration takes place due to the p-n junction formed at the interface of Cu2S and CT-10. Cu2S injects electrons to CdS/Ta2O5 and accepts holes generated at the valance band of CdS, which strongly suppresses the charge recombination in the ternary system and increases the rate of hydrogen generation. Parallel to this process, Ta2O5 readily takes the electrons from CdS, which reduces the accumulation of electrons at the conduction band of CdS, and leads to avoiding the recombination of photoexcited charged species, which results in a high rate of hydrogen evolution. Fig. 7 (a) displays the influence of Cu2S over the photocatalytic performance of CT-10 with the time of irradiation. A constant high rate of hydrogen evolution about 131 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat was noticed by making ternary composite with Cu2S. At the minimum loading (5 wt%) of Cu2S, the observed rate of hydrogen evolution is 108 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat that is significantly higher than that of CT-10 (65 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat), which reveals that the injection of photoexcited electrons from Cu2S to CdS/Ta2O5 taking place. On increasing the weight loading, the observed maximum rate of hydrogen evolution is 131 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat for 10 wt% Cu2S loading, which is higher than the rate (85 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat) observed for the binary nanocomposite made of CdS loaded with 10 wt% of Cu2S denoted as CC-10, and which evidences that the ternary composite made of Cu2S/CdS/Ta2O5 readily delivers the higher rate of hydrogen evolution successfully. In this scheme, the heterojunctioned ternary coupling leads to narrowing the charge transfer bandgap energy by splitting the whole band edge into several subedged constraints. On further increment of Cu2S, the rate of hydrogen evolution was decreased to 120 and 118 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat for 12.5 and 15 wt% of Cu2S, respectively. This may be ascribed to slow charge transfer between the Cu2S to CdS, and accumulation of excited electrons at CB of Cu2S will occur, which leads to an increase in the photoexcited charge recombination within Cu2S resulting in a lower rate of hydrogen evolution [59]. However, at the optimum loading of Cu2S, the rate of H2 evolution was more for the ternary composite (CT-10/CS-10) made of Cu2S/Ta2O5/CdS compared to binary composites CT-10 (CdS/Ta2O5-10 wt%) and CC-10(CdS/Cu2S-10 wt%). From Fig. S4, it is clearly noticed that the rate of hydrogen evolution for individual materials was minimum but nanocomposites showed a huge acceleration in the rate of hydrogen evolution, which clearly demonstrated that the photoinduced charge recombination was highly suppressed due to the multicharge transfer process that occurred at the heterojunctions [60]. The durability of the photocatalyst was examined using the optimized composite (CT-10/CS-10) under the same experimental conditions for five cycles (Fig. 7(b)). The hydrogen evolution rate was constant for the first three continuous cycles further moving to the fourth and fifth cycles, a slight decrease in the rate of hydrogen evolution is noticed. However, a 95% rate of hydrogen evolution was retained even after the fifth cycle. It is known that on the prolonged photocatalytic process, the saturation of active sites takes place and leads to lowering the rate of hydrogen evolution [61]. In addition, during the long-term continuous photocatalytic water splitting process, the depletion of sacrificial reagent concentration will also lower the rate of hydrogen production [23]. Finally, the obtained results revealed that the prepared ternary nanocomposite is photocatalytically stable and effective for enhanced hydrogen evolution."
13,Visible light to H2 conversion efficiency calculation,"3.4 Visible light to H2 conversion efficiency calculation The visible light to H2 conversion efficiency is measured for all the ternary nanocomposites and pristine catalysts using the following equation [62].

Consequently, the conversion efficiency of the proposed ternary nanocomposite is compared with a few same state of art composites ( Table 2 ), which clearly evidences that the rationally designed ternary nanocomposite made of Cu2S/Ta2O5/CdS have the ability to deliver a better rate of H2 production. Moreover, the morphology of insisted materials also encouraged the rate of hydrogen production by increasing the active area towards hydrogen production."
14,Morphological and chemical analysis of used catalyst,"3.5 Morphological and chemical analysis of used catalyst The photocatalytic stability of prepared nanocomposite has been analyzed successfully and explained in detail in the above discussions. But it is essential to prove the designed nanocomposite is stable chemically as well as structurally. In the continuity of the above statement, the recovered samples have been examined using HR-TEM and XPS techniques displayed in Figs. S5 and S6 & S7, respectively. From Fig. S5 it was strongly evidenced that the surface morphology of the components such as Cu2S, CdS, and Ta2O5 present in the nanocomposite is highly stable even after the five cycles of experiments. And the uniform distribution of materials in the composite did not get disturbed and which is proved by analyzing elemental mapping of the used catalyst, as shown in Fig. S6. In addition to this, the evidence which can justify the chemical stability of the recovered sample is displayed in Fig. S7. Here, the survey spectrum and high-resolution deconvoluted peaks with corresponding binding energies of the existing elements (Cu, Cd, S, Ta, and O) in the nanocomposite are almost the same as freshly prepared ternary composites (Fig. 5). From this, we could conclude that the ternary nanocomposite prepared via solid-state approach possesses stability, physically as well as chemically."
15,Plausible reaction mechanism of Cu2S/Ta2O5/CdS ternary nanocomposite photocatalyst for hydrogen production,"3.6 Plausible reaction mechanism of Cu2S/Ta2O5/CdS ternary nanocomposite photocatalyst for hydrogen production Based on the results obtained from the UV-DRS, VB-XPS, and photocatalytic experiments, the projected plausible mechanism to produce the hydrogen from Cu2S/Ta2O5/CdS ternary composite is displayed in Fig. 8 . From the UV-DRS absorption spectrum, it is clear that CdS and Cu2S were active in visible light, whereas Ta2O5 will not be active due to its wide bandgap. Whole experiments were carried out under a 250W QTH (Quartz Tungsten Halogen) lamp that can produce only visible light. Whenever the photocatalyst gets illuminated by the visible light, the visible light active semiconductors in the system such as Cu2S and CdS get excited and produce electrons and holes (Eq. 5). Due to the formation of external energy levels and the variation in band edge potentials, the electrons from the conduction band of Cu2S will be migrated to the conduction band of CdS via interfacial charge transfer mechanism and subsequently transferred to the conduction band of Ta2O5. Parallelly, holes will be collected at the valance band of Cu2S. Here, due to the wide range bandgap, visible light energy is insufficient to excite the Ta2O5 semiconductor, but can be used as an electron sink for the excitons, which are collected via interparticle charge transfer, as shown in Eq. 6. (5) C u 2 S / T a 2 O 5 / C d S + 2 h v → → C u 2 S ( 2 h + + 2 e − ) + C d S ( 2 h + + 2 e − ) + T a 2 O 5 ( d u e t o V i s i b l e l i g h t u n a b l e t o g e t e x c i t e d s p e c i e s ) (6) C u 2 S ( 2 h + + 2 e − ) + C d S ( 2 h + + 2 e − ) + T a 2 O 5 ( P o s s e s s l o w e r C B p o s i t i o n ) → C u 2 S ( 4 h + ) + C d S ( 2 e − ) + T a 2 O 5 ( 2 e − ) The sacrificial reagent added to the solution reacts with the holes remains at the valance band, which hinders the charge recombination in the system (Eq. 7). (7) C u 2 S ( 4 h + ) + C H 3 − C H ( O H ) − C O O H + H 2 O → 4 H + + C O 2 + C H 3 − C O − C O O H On the other hand, electrons at the conduction band of CdS and Ta2O5 reduces the generated H+ ions into H2, as shown in the Eq. 8. (8) C d S ( 2 e − ) + T a 2 O 5 ( 2 e − ) + 4 H + → 2 H 2 In such a way, Cu2S injects electrons to CdS and collects holes from the same, which suppresses the photoinduced charge carriers recombination to a greater extent, and the accumulation of photoexcited electrons will be readily reduced by Ta2O5 results in a gradual increment in the hydrogen production rate. Finally, the observed photocatalytic performance of the prepared photocatalyst clearly proves the above-proposed mechanism."
16,Conclusions,"CdS NRs and six petal structured Cu2S materials were synthesized successfully via solvent mixed hydrothermal process. The photocatalytic studies for all the prepared catalysts carried out under the QTH (Quartz Tungsten Halogen lamp), which can readily illuminate visible light effectively. The six-petal structure of Cu2S and 1-Dimensionality of CdS nanoparticles were confirmed using SEM and TEM analysis. The uniform attachment of Cu2S, CdS, and Ta2O5 was scrutinized with the help of High-resolution TEM elemental mapping. The sample of CT-10/CS-10 shows better photocatalytic performance than CT-10 and CC-10 binary composites under identical experimental conditions. It can be ascribed as follows: Shape-controlled nanostructures (six-petal Cu2S and 1D CdS) has huge advantages over 0-D nanoparticles as they improve the active surface area and flow of electrons. In addition to this, Ta2O5 reduces the accumulation of injected electrons at the CdS conduction band, and the developed interfacial contact among the composites will increase the charge carrier transfer. A high rate of 131 mmol.h−1.g−1 cat hydrogen evolution was achieved with the light energy to the H2 conversion efficiency of 5.6%. This superior performance was obtained due to step-wise interfacial charge transfer within the ternary composite, which can greatly suppress the photoinduced charge recombination. Moreover, the resultant Cu2S/Ta2O5/CdS ternary nanocomposite showed well durability against recycling performance and which displayed physicochemical stability also."
