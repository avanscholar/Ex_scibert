0,Introduction,"The development of industrialization has caused a series of environmental problems. Heavy metal pollution is the most common in the water system. Especially, the direct discharge of acidic wastewater without treatment has aggravated heavy metal pollution. The acidic wastewater from the battery, printing, mining, and metallurgical industries contains various heavy metal ions, such as Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) (Zhang et al., 2019; Godiya et al., 2018; Gu et al., 2020). The heavy metal ions possess the nature of toxicity, bioaccumulation, and non-degradability (Li et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). As a highly toxic metal ion, Pb(II) would damage the brain, kidney, nerve, and immune system (Karmakar et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2018; Usman et al., 2021). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stipulates that the maximum contaminant level for Pb(II) in drinking water is 15 ppb (United States Environment). In industrial production, the neutralization treatment of acidic heavy metal wastewater will produce a large amount of heavy metal sludge, and post-treatment is difficult. The best way is to remove heavy metal ions under acidic conditions. Over the past few decades, various technologies for heavy metal ions removal have been developed, including chemical precipitation, electrolysis, solvent extraction, membrane separation, and adsorption (Panja et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021). Compared with other methods, the adsorption process has the advantages of no chemical sludge, no secondary pollution, low energy consumption, low costs, and easy operation (Zhao et al., 2019a). Numerous adsorbent materials have been developed for the removal of Pb(II). Citric acid functionalized bougainvillea spectabilis can adsorb Pb(II) with a maximum capacity of 67.11 mg/g pH = 6 (Nazir et al., 2019). Biochar-orthophosphate composites adsorb Pb(II) about 323.02 mg/g at pH = 5.0 (Gao et al., 2019). Modified hydrochar removes Pb(II) at pH = 5.0 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 92.80 mg/g (Xia et al., 2019). An agro-based adsorbent Sorghum bicolor L. biomass shows the maximum adsorption capacity of 6.289 mg/g for Pb(II) at pH = 5.0–6.0 (Salman et al., 2013). PAN/chitosan nanofibers adsorb Pb(II) about 441.2 mg/g at pH = 6 (Jamshidifard et al., 2019). A crofton weed adsorbent can adsorb Pb(II) about 234.60 mg/g at a pH = 5 (Cheng et al., 2021). Magnetic Fe3S4/reduced graphene oxide composites remove Pb(II) about 285.71 mg/g at a pH = 6 (Kong et al., 2017). The common feature of these materials is that they are rich in hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amino groups, which provide abundant coordination sites for Pb(II). It is worth pointing out that most reported adsorbents tend to adsorb Pb(II) under neutral conditions (pH about 5–6) because H+ competes with metal cations under acidic conditions (pH about 1–4) (Zhang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018). Few adsorbents have been reported to adsorb Pb(II) efficiently under acidic conditions. This dramatically limits the practical application of adsorbents in acidic wastewater, such as the millions of tons of lead ore wastewater (pH about 3) per year. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop adsorbents that can remove Pb(II) under acidic conditions. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a hydrophilic polymer containing a large number of hydroxyl groups. The non-toxicity and biocompatibility of PVA make it widely applied in the biomedical field (Ali and Shahid, 2019). However, the obstacles of dissolution and limited adsorption capacity restrict the application of PVA in water treatment. Many researchers modified PVA to improve adsorption performance by cross-linking, electrospinning, pelletizing, or filming. Huafeng Tian fabricated PVA electrospun nanofiber films crosslinked by glutaraldehyde to adsorb Cu(II) and Pb(II), and the adsorption equilibrium time of Pb(II) and Cu(II) was 10 h and 5 h, respectively (Tian et al., 2019). Yun Zhang prepared macroreticular PVA beads to selectively remove Pb(II) in an aqueous environment, and the adsorption reached equilibrium after 2.5 h (Zhang et al., 2010). Jian Hua Chen reported Cu(II)-imprinted porous film adsorbent Cu–PVA–SA, and the adsorption for Cu(II) obtained equilibrium within 120 min (Chen et al., 2011). Dong Wang synthesized cellulose nanocrystals/chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol (CNC/CS/PVA) composite nanofibrous films to adsorb Cu(II) and Pb(II), and the adsorption equilibrium time exceeds 24 h (Wang et al., 2018). P. Ajitha designed chitosan oligosaccharide-graftmaleic anhydride(COS-g-MAH)/Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/silk fibroin (SF) composite for removing lead (II) ions from aqueous solution, and the adsorption equilibrium time was about 180 min (Ajitha et al., 2017). ZHANG Dong used butyraldehyde to cross-link water-soluble phosphorylated polyvinyl alcohol for the first time, and the prepared P-PVB adsorbed rare earth ions (Eu(III) and Am(III)) in 2 h (ZHANG et al., 2003). PVA materials have the potential to adsorb heavy metal ions, but there is a general problem of slow adsorption rate. Superabsorbent polymer is functional polymer materials with a lot of hydrophilic groups, which can imbibe water about a hundred times their dried weight and exhibits extraordinary water retention ability (Khan et al., 2018; Mehra et al., 2021). The superabsorbent polymer can absorb water and swell into a hydrogel (Wei et al., 2021). The buried water in hydrogels provides hydrogen bond sites and nanometer channels for the adsorption of pollutants, which is beneficial for the free diffusion of water-soluble molecules and the exposure of active sites (Ma et al., 2017). However, the defect of most superabsorbent polymers is the slow swelling, which lasts a few hours, and even days, resulting in slow adsorption and desorption kinetics (Wang and Wang, 2016; Dong et al., 2018; Perumal et al., 2019). Therefore, constructing a superabsorbent polymer with rapid swelling ability is essential for achieving ultrafast adsorption. Phosphate groups have been found to possess the excellent ability to complex with the heavy metal ion (Wang et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015; Costa et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017), and the structure of -P(OH) is easy to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond. Phosphorus pentoxide is commonly used as a phosphorylation agent in industrial production. It reacts with alcohol to obtain a mixture of phosphate monoester, phosphate diester, and a small amount of phosphate triester (Ba et al., 2005). Inspired by this, we synthesized the polyvinyl alcohol phosphate ester (PVAP) by the facile one-pot method. The polyvinyl alcohol was cross-linked by the phosphate ester to form a superabsorbent polymer. The PVAP exhibited ultrafast water swelling ability. The characterization of PVAP involved the analysis of the functional groups, phosphorus content, surface morphology, and swelling degree. The adsorption performance of PVAP for Pb(II) under acidic conditions was investigated in detail by the batch method. The effects of pH, time, initial concentration, temperature, and ionic strength on the adsorption of Pb(II) were studied systematically. To explore the practical application value of PVAP, recycling experiments and purification experiments on simulated water samples were carried out. In addition, the removal effect of PVAP on various mixed metal ions was researched. The adsorption mechanism was revealed by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 98–99% hydrolyzed, low molecular weight) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (China) Chemical Co., Ltd. Phosphorus pentoxide (≥98.0%), N, N-Dimethylformamide (99.8%, HyDry, with molecular sieves, Water ≤ 50 ppm), ethanol absolute (AR, ≥ 99.7%), lead nitrate (AR, ≥ 99.0%), copper nitrate trihydrate (AR, 99.0–102.0%), cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (AR, ≥ 99.0%), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (AR, ≥ 98.5%), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (AR, ≥ 98.0%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (AR, ≥ 99.0%), potassium nitrate (AR, ≥ 99.0%), sodium nitrate (AR, ≥ 99.0%), calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (AR, ≥ 99.0%), sodium hydroxide (AR, ≥ 96.0%) and nitric acid (GR, 65.0–68.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used as received. All aqueous solutions were prepared with deionized water."
3,Preparation of PVAP adsorbent,"2.2 Preparation of PVAP adsorbent Dried PVA particles (2.00 g), N, N-Dimethylformamide (80 mL), and phosphorus oxide (1.61 g) were added in a two-necked flask in turn. The mixture was heated slowly to 130 °C with magnetic stirring and kept for 4 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then the red and sticky solid was filtered from the solution. The obtained red solid swelled and washed in deionized water until neutrality. Next, a large amount of ethanol was added to dehydrate the red hydrogel until the hydrogel lost almost all water. Finally, the red solid was filtered and dried overnight at 50 °C under vacuum to obtain PVAP (2.21 g). Elemental analysis: C 34.71%, H 6.94%, P 13.40%, O 44.95%."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations Infrared spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer 2000 FT-IR spectrometer. The morphology and element distribution of the adsorbent was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse spectrometer (EDS) (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Germany). The adsorbent samples were pretreated by microwave digestion equipment (MARS6, CEM), and then the phosphorus content was measured by an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (iCAP6300, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The content of C, H atoms was measured by the elemental analyzer (vario EL cube, Elementar). The metal ion concentration of the samples was quantified by the inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Adsorbent aqueous solutions with different pH values were treated with an ultrasonic homogenizer (SCIENTZ-IID), and then the zeta potentials were measured using ZETA SIZER NANO (Marven). The surface element composition was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, smartlab SE, Rigaku)."
5,Determination of swelling ratio,"2.4 Determination of swelling ratio The gravimetric method was applied to investigate the swelling ratio of samples in deionized water at 25 °C. Deionized water with pH = 3 was continuously added to 0.5 g dried adsorbent until the adsorbent no longer swelled, and the equilibrium time was recorded. Deionized water with different pH values was added to a series of 0.5 g dried samples until the samples no longer swelled. Then water on the surface of the samples was wiped off with filter paper, and the wet weight of the samples was weighed. The swelling ratio (SR) was calculated with the equation (1): (1) S R % = W s − W d W d × 100 % where W s and W d are the weight of swollen and dried samples, respectively."
6,Metal ions adsorption experiments,"2.5 Metal ions adsorption experiments The adsorption for Pb(II) in an aqueous solution was carried out in batches. After the adsorption experiment, the adsorbent was separated with filter paper, and the concentration of metal ions was measured by ICP-OES. Every adsorption test was repeated three times, and the average value was taken as the result. A series of Pb(II) solutions (100 mg/L) with different pH values were prepared to study the pH effect. The pH values of the solutions were adjusted using 0.1 mol/L HNO3 or 0.1 mol/L NaOH solution. Different concentrations of Pb(II) solutions (10–1000 mg/L, pH = 3) were prepared to investigate adsorption isotherm. The adsorption was investigated by adding 10 mL solution and 10 mg adsorbent in a 15 mL oscillation tube. The oscillation tubes were shaken for 20 min in a thermostatic water bath oscillator. The adsorption kinetics experiment lasted for 20 min in the same Pb(II) solution (100 mg/L, pH = 3), and samples were taken out at different time intervals. For regeneration, 0.1 g adsorbent and 0.1 L Pb(II) solution (100 mg/L) were added into a beaker under stirring at 25 °C for 20 min. The used adsorbent was eluted with 1 M HNO3 (10 mL) for 40 min and then washed with deionized water to neutrality. The desorbed adsorbent was dried in an oven at 80 °C for the next adsorption. The subsequent cycle experiment was followed by the procedure described above. 20 mg adsorbent was added to a mixed solution of Pb(II), Cu(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Co(II), and Ni(II) (20 mL, pH = 3, 10 mg/L for every metal ion) for the multiple metal ions adsorption studies. 0.1 g PVAP was added into 100 mL of simulated water sample for purification. Equilibrium adsorption capacity and the percentage of removal for metal ions were calculated with equations (2) and (3). The distribution coefficient of metal ion was calculated using equation (4). (2) Q e = ( C 0 − C e ) × V m (3) R = C 0 − C e C 0 × 100 % (4) K d = Q e C e where Q e is equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg/L), C 0 and C e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the solution respectively (mg/L), V is the volume (L), m is the quality of the adsorbent (g), R is the percentage of removal, and K d (mL/g) is the distribution coefficient."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The FT-IR spectrum of raw material PVA and adsorbent PVAP is shown in Fig. 1 a and b. The broad absorption peak at 3445 cm−1 is attributed to the O–H stretching vibration. The typical peaks at 1213, 1080, 937 cm−1 are assigned to PO, P–O–C, and P–OH, respectively (Xu et al., 2018), which proves PVA has been successfully phosphate esterified. The result of element analysis reveals that the mass percentage of phosphorus is 13.4%. The structure of the adsorbent is shown in Fig. S1. Part of the phosphate diester cross-links polyvinyl alcohol chains to form a network structure. The surface morphologies of PVA and PVAP before and after water adsorption were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2 a shows PVA is solid with a relatively flat surface. After modification, PVAP is solid with many folds and voids (Fig. 2b). The PVAP swelled by absorbing water was freeze-dried for morphology observation. As shown in Fig. 2c, the adsorbent exhibits interconnected macroporous sponge structures after absorbing water, which further demonstrates that PVA has been cross-linked to be a three-dimensional network structure. The EDS elemental mapping testifies the uniform distribution of phosphorus on the adsorbent (Fig. S2). The adsorption of Pb(II) greatly changed the surface morphology of PVAP, as shown in Fig. 2d. The macroporous network structure of PVAP disappeared and became a stone-like structure with a large number of small particle protrusions on the surface. The corresponding EDS elemental mapping revealed the uniform distribution of Pb(II) on the surface of the adsorbent (Fig. S3)."
9,pH effect on swelling ratio,"3.2 pH effect on swelling ratio The pH of a solution is one of the important factors affecting the swelling ratio of superabsorbents. As shown in Fig. 3 , swelling ratio of PVAP was measured at different pH values ranging from 1.0 to 7.0. The swelling ratio of the adsorbent is almost constant in the pH range of 3–7 (~1900%) and drops to 1294% and 914% at pH = 2 and 1, respectively. In contrast, the swelling ratio of PVA does not exceed 26% in the pH range of 1–7. The excellent water adsorption capacity of PVAP can be ascribed to two aspects: (1) The introduction of phosphate groups adds a large number of hydrogen bonding sites, which improves the affinity of PVAP for water molecules. (2) The cross-linked network structure provides favorable spatial positions for the complexation of water molecules, which increases the water storage capacity. The decrease in swelling ratio is attributed to the protonation of P–O-, which makes it difficult for the adsorbent to form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules. Compared with PVA, the PVAP not only exhibits remarkable water adsorption capacity but also shows rapid water adsorption kinetics. The dried PVAP reaches the water adsorption equilibrium within 30 s (see details in the ESI, Movie Ⅰ), which is much faster than most superabsorbents (Mahida and Patel, 2016; Ni et al., 2018)."
10,Pb(II) adsorption,"3.3 Pb(II) adsorption 3.3.1 Effect of adsorbent dosage The effect of adsorbent dosage on the removal of Pb(II) was researched (Fig. S4). The removal ratio increases from 87% to 99.9% when the adsorbent dosage changes from 0.2 g/L to 1.6 g/L. However, the removal ratio is almost unchanged when the adsorbent dosage continues to increase from 1.0 g/L to 1.6 g/L. Considering the treatment effect and economic cost, the optimal adsorbent dosage is set as 1 g/L. 3.3.2 Effect of solution pH The pH of the aqueous solution is an essential factor for the adsorption process. The ideal adsorbent should be capable of adsorbing heavy metal ions in a wide pH range, especially in acidic wastewater. The Pb(II) starts to precipitate at pH = 5.8 in 100 mg/L aqueous solutions, simulated by Visual MINTEQ 3.1 software. Hence, the removal ratio of PVAP for Pb(II) was investigated in the pH range of 1–6. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the removal ratio for Pb(II) can reach 93.7% at pH = 2 and is more than 99.9% in the pH range of 3–6. Even under strong acid conditions of pH = 1, the removal ratio still reaches 18.9%. To further explore the essence of the abovementioned result, the zeta potential of PVAP at different pH values was monitored (Fig. 4b). The Zeta potential is less than −29 mV in the pH range of 2–7, indicating that the adsorbent can provide a large number of negatively charged binding sites for Pb(II) in this range. In addition, the zeta potential sharply decreases from −29.7 mV at pH = 2 to −17.0 mV at pH = 1 due to the protonation of the P–O- at lower pH values, which indicates fewer sites were available at pH = 1 for adsorption of Pb(II). So far, most of the reported adsorbents tend to adsorb Pb(II) under near-neutral conditions (pH = 5–6). The degree of protonation of functional groups increases with the increase of acidity when pH ranged from 5 to 1, and the removal ratio of the adsorbent for Pb(II) decreases gradually. Table S1 lists the removal ratios of various adsorbents for Pb(II) at pH = 3 and pH = 5. The removal ratio of almost all adsorbents at pH = 5 is more significant than that under the condition of pH = 3, and the removal ratio is quite unsatisfactory at pH = 3. Unexpectedly, PVAP can achieve a removal ratio of 99.9% at pH = 3, which is beneficial for treating acidic wastewater. 3.3.3 Ultrafast kinetic adsorption The rapid removal of pollutants from wastewater has always been the research goal of scientists. A large number of adsorbents have been reported so far for the adsorption of Pb(II). However, adsorbents with the ability to remove Pb(II) in a few minutes under acidic conditions are rare (Table S2). Fig. 5 a shows the adsorption curves of PVA and PVAP for Pb(II) at pH = 3. The removal for Pb(II) by PVAP reaches 85% in 1 min. The adsorption can reach equilibrium in only 5 min, and the removal ratio is more than 99.9%. By contrast, the removal ratio of Pb(II) by PVA is only 34% in 20 min. The ultrafast swelling kinetics and high swelling ratio of PVAP render the adsorption site adequately available at the initial stage (Pan et al., 2016). As a result of electrostatic interaction, lead ions quickly anchor onto the surface of the adsorbent to reach electrical neutrality. Therefore, the PVAP exhibited ultrafast kinetic adsorption for Pb(II). The adsorption of Pb(II) considerably changes the surface morphology of PVAP. The porous, spongy structure disappears, and the adsorbent surface is full of many small particle protrusions (Fig. 2c and d). The reason for this phenomenon is that lead ions have replaced the position of water molecules to complex on the surface of the adsorbent, causing the swollen adsorbent to lose water. It is visible to the naked eye that PVAP loses water after adsorbing lead ions (Fig. 5b). To further determine the adsorption kinetics mechanism of PVAP, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models are applied for the adsorption process of Pb(II). The pseudo-first-order model assumes that ionic diffusion is the rate-controlling step of the adsorption process. The pseudo-second-order model believes that chemical adsorption is the rate-controlling step involving electron transfer and sharing between the adsorbate and the adsorbent (Fan et al., 2016). The expressions of models are as follows. The pseudo-first-order model: (5) log ( Q e − Q t ) = l o g Q e − ( k 1 2.303 ) t The pseudo-second-order model: (6) t Q t = 1 k 2 Q e 2 + 1 Q e t where Q e (mg/g) is the adsorption capacities at equilibrium time, Q t (mg/g) is the adsorption capacities at a specific time t, and k 1 (min−1), k 2 (g·mg−1·min−1) are the adsorption rate constants. The fitted equilibrium absorption capacity Qcal using the pseudo-second-order model is 104.82 mg/g with a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.9997 (Table S3), close to the experimental result Qexp = 99.9 mg/g (Fig. 6 a and b). The result demonstrates the chemical interaction process is the rate-controlling step (Zhao et al., 2019b). 3.3.4 Effect of initial concentration The removal ratio of heavy metal ions at different initial concentrations is an important indicator for evaluating adsorbents (Ali et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. S5, the equilibrium adsorption capacity continues to increase to 553.75 mg/g when the initial concentration changes from 10 mg/L to 1000 mg/L. In particular, the Pb(II) removal ratio is more than 99% when the initial concentration is in the range of 10–200 mg/L. In the initial concentration range of 200–400 mg/L, the removal ratio is still above 90%. The excellent removal ratio in a wide range of initial concentrations under acidic conditions is very effective for the actual treatment of wastewater. While the initial concentration gradually increases in the range of 400–1000 mg/L, the removal ratio gradually drops to 55.3%. The declining removal ratio is attributed to the gradual saturation of the binding sites. 3.3.5 The adsorption isotherm and thermodynamics The influence of temperature on the adsorption capacity of Pb(II) by PVAP was studied at 298, 308, 318 K (Fig. S6). At a relatively low initial concentration (10–300 mg/L), the equilibrium adsorption capacity at different temperatures is almost identical. And the equilibrium adsorption capacity decreases with increasing temperature when the initial concentration is greater than 300 mg/L. The results indicated that the adsorbent is less favorable for the adsorption of Pb(II) at a higher temperature when the initial concentration is greater than 300 mg/L. To explore the adsorption behavior of Pb(II) on the surface of the adsorbent, the adsorption isotherm data are fitted with the Langmuir and Freundlich models. Langmuir isotherm assumes that the adsorbent has a homogeneous adsorption surface, and Freundlich isotherm assumes heterogeneous adsorption (Wang et al., 2016). The linear equations of the Langmuir model and Freundlich model are described as follows: (7) C e Q e = 1 Q m K L + C e Q m (8) l o g Q e = l o g K F + 1 n l o g C e where C e (mg/L) and Q e (mg/g) are the equilibrium concentration in the solution and the equilibrium adsorption amount in the adsorbent, respectively. Q m (mg/g) is the maximum adsorption amount. K L (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant. K F (mg/g) is the Freundlich constant, and n is the adsorption intensity index. The linear fitting curves and parameters are shown in Fig. 6c and d and Table S4. The correlation coefficients of the Langmuir model are all higher than the Freundlich model, and the calculated maximum adsorption amount from the Langmuir model (Qcal = 558.66 mg/g) is very close to the experimental value (Qexp = 553.75 mg/g). The result indicates the adsorption process can be well fitted by the Langmuir model. In other words, the adsorption of Pb(II) by PVAP can be described as monolayer adsorption. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated to further analyze the properties of the adsorption process (Table S5). The related equations are as follows: (9) l n K d = − Δ H R T + Δ S R (10) Δ G = Δ H − T Δ S where K d (mL/g) is the distribution coefficient. R (8.3145 J mol−1 K−1) is the ideal gas constant. ΔG (kJ·mol−1), ΔH (kJ·mol−1), ΔS (kJ·mol−1·K−1) are Gibbs free energy, enthalpy change, and entropy change, respectively. The negative values of ΔG and ΔH suggest the spontaneous and exothermic nature of the adsorption process (Jamshidifard et al., 2019). The negative value of ΔS indicates that adsorption is a chaos-reducing process. The reduction of chaos can be attributed to a large amount of freely moving Pb(II) being fixed on the surface of the adsorbent. 3.3.6 Adsorption mechanism The results of adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics, and isotherm show that the adsorption process of Pb(II) is spontaneous monomolecular chemisorption. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were performed to further analyze the adsorption mechanism. The survey spectrum and high-resolution spectra of the adsorbent before (PVAP) and after the adsorption of Pb(II) (PVAP-Pb) are shown in Fig. 7 . A new Pb peak appears in the survey spectra of PVAP-Pb, and it can be deconvoluted into two peaks, 4f5/2 at 143.76 eV and 4f7/2 at 138.96 eV (Fig. 7b), which further confirms the adsorption of Pb(II) on PVAP. The high-resolution O 1s spectra of PVAP can be split into three peaks, P–O/PO at 533.55 eV, C–OH at 532.74 eV, and C–O–P at 531.95 eV (Fig. 7c). The binding energy decreases to 533.26 eV, 532.06 eV, and 531.86 eV, respectively, after the adsorption of Pb(II) (Fig. 7d). The above results demonstrate the complexation of Pb(II) with the phosphate ester group and the hydroxyl group. The high-resolution P 2p spectra of PVAP (Fig. 7e) presents two peaks at 134.52 eV and 133.65 eV, corresponding to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively (Yuan et al., 2017). After the interaction with Pb(II), the binding energy shifts to lower values (134.21 eV and 133.31 eV) (Fig. 7f), which proves the chelation between Pb(II) and phosphate ester groups. FT-IR spectra were also used to explore the adsorption mechanism. After the adsorption of Pb(II), the peak of O–H stretching vibration shifts from 3445 cm−1 to 3437 cm−1, and the peaks of PO, P–O–C, and P–OH shift from 1213, 1080, 937 cm−1 to 1198, 1063, 924 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 1b and c). The results further indicate that the phosphate ester group and the hydroxyl group chelate with Pb(II). In summary, the adsorption mechanism is surface complexation (Scheme 1 ). The Pb(II) rapidly chelates with the structure of P–O- to achieve electric neutrality. The oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups and other oxygen atoms in the phosphate group also participate in the complexation of Pb(II), making it a stable coordination structure."
11,Evaluation of the adsorbent,"3.4 Evaluation of the adsorbent 3.4.1 Competitive adsorption Industrial wastewater often contains soluble salts, which has a significant influence on the adsorption of heavy metal ions (Lei, 2000). Coexisting cations, such as Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), can compete with Pb(II) for the available adsorption sites. Therefore, a competition experiment was performed to evaluate the influence of coexisting cations. From Fig. 8 , it can be observed the low concentration (0.001 M) of Na(I), K(I), and Ca(II) has little effect on the adsorption. Na(I)and K(I) still have a slight effect when the concentration of competing ions is 0.01 M, while Ca(II) can obviously hinder the adsorption of Pb(II) (decrease about 53%). A higher concentration of competing ions (0.1 M) has a significantly inhibiting effect on the adsorption. This phenomenon can be attributed to two aspects. On the one hand, the existence of a large number of cations in the solution, especially in the swollen adsorbent, hinders the diffusion of Pb(II) to the surface of the adsorbent. On the other hand, cations occupy part of the complexing sites of the adsorbent. In contrast to Na(I) and K(I), Ca(II) exhibits a stronger competitive role because of the higher charge. 3.4.2 Reusability The reusability is a significant indicator to evaluate the practical application of the adsorbent. Here, 1 M HNO3 is used as an eluting agent for generating PVAP-Pb. As shown in Fig. 9 , the removal ratio shows a slight loss (within 1%) after ten continuous recycles. The excellent reusability with facile work-up procedure makes PVAP a remarkable adsorbent for the treatment of Pb(II) pollution. 3.4.3 Simultaneous removal of various heavy metal ions Polluted wastewater often contains multiple metal ions. The removal effect of adsorbent on multiple metal ions reflects its application value in practical wastewater treatment. Therefore, a mixed solution of Pb(II), Cu(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Co(II), and Ni(II) with the initial concentration of 10 mg/L for every metal ion was prepared at pH = 3 to investigate the adsorption ability of PVA and PVAP (Fig. 10 ). The removal ratio of PVA for each metal ion does not exceed 10%, while the removal ratio of PVAP for each metal ion exceeds 97%. This result fully shows that PVAP has a better adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions than PVA. Although PVAP had a high removal ratio for various mixed metal ions, the slight difference in removal ratio illustrates the difference in affinity for different metal ions. The distribution coefficients are calculated for the comparison of ionic affinity (Table S6). The affinity order of PVAP for metal ions is Pb(II)＞Cd(II)＞Cu(II)＞Co(II)＞Zn(II)＞Ni(II). The adsorption affinity of adsorbents to different ions is related to various factors, such as ionic radius, electronegativity, the stability constants of associated metal hydroxides, electrostatic repulsion among metal ions, and so on (Ma et al., 2019). 3.4.4 Adsorption behavior in simulated wastewater The simulated wastewater was employed to evaluate the applicability of PVAP. In this work, we simulated some heavy metals in a water sample from a mining area (Zhao et al., 2014). The wastewater composition and purification results are given in Table 1 . The content of Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) after purification is in line with EPA drinking water standards. Therefore, PVAP is promising to be a good treatment agent for acidic heavy metal wastewater."
12,Conclusions,"A new superabsorbent, polyvinyl alcohol phosphate ester (PVAP), was prepared using a facile but effective one-pot method. A few interesting results and findings can be demonstrated below: i. The PVAP exhibits ultrafast adsorption kinetics for water and reaches equilibrium quite fast (~30 s). The swelling ratio of PVAP for water is around 1900%, much higher than that of PVA (only 26%); ii. The PVAP shows excellent adsorption capacity and ultrafast adsorption kinetics for Pb(II). The calculated maximum adsorption capacity for Pb(II) is 558.66 mg/g at pH = 3, and the adsorption reaches equilibrium within 5 min; iii. The adsorption conforms to the pseudo-second-order kinetics model, which indicates that the chemical interaction process is the rate-controlling step. The Langmuir model can fit the experimental data well, which demonstrates the adsorption of Pb(II) is a monolayer. The thermodynamic parameters suggest that the adsorption is a spontaneous and exothermic process. iv. The adsorption mechanism is surface complexation. The oxygen atoms of the phosphate group and the hydroxyl group are involved in the complexation of Pb(II). v. Adsorbent evaluation results show that a high concentration of salt is not conducive to Pb(II) adsorption. The PVAP is reusable, and the removal ratio is still maintained above 99% after ten recycles. Meanwhile, PVAP can realize the simultaneously effective adsorption for many metal ions (Cu(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Co(II), and Ni(II)). The PVAP can also purify the simulated acid mine heavy metal wastewater to meet EPA drinking water standard. In general, the above results suggest that the PVAP is an outstanding adsorbent for heavy metal ions and hopeful to be applied in acidic wastewater treatment in practice."
