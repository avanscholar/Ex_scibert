0,Introduction,"Lignin, as the protective cell wall of plants, is the second most biopolymer in lignocellulosic biomass followed by cellulose, whose content varies from 11 to 40 % [1,2]. It is widely accepted that lignin was defined as an amorphous polyphenolic material, which can be formed from an enzyme-mediated dehydrogenative polymerization of three phenylpropanoid monomers (coniferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl alcohols) [3]. Considering that, lignin could be an attractive starting material to produce hydrocarbon and aromatic chemicals. Simultaneously, the unregular-repeat units and complex three-dimensional structure are still the major challenges for utilization of lignin. Even though various depolymerization technologies have been of interest in the last a few decades, the major technology is still limited to combustion for providing heat. Pyrolysis is a relatively mature thermochemical process, and widely used for the industrial processing of organic materials to obtain oil product or valuable chemicals. However, as for lignin, its cross-linked structure is prone to repolymerization during the thermochemical conversion, resulting in more than half yield of char [4,5]. And the selectivity of pyrolytic products is also relatively low. Currently, catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) is one of technologies to improve the selectivity of products, especially olefins and aromatics. Fe-loading zeolite catalysts [6,7], La-loading HZSM-5 [8] have been checked, even increased the production of light olefins to 8.6 C-mol.%. Indeed, light olefins regarded as the intermediate products during fast pyrolysis, are hard to be selectively produced [9]. The types of feedstock have larger influence on the yield of olefins compared with temperature, residence time even catalysts, due to its internal structure and chemical properties [8]. Thus, modification of lignin seems a potential strategy to make a better use of lignin and achieve higher olefin and aromatics yield from fast pyrolysis. Hydrogenation is used to tailor the functional groups, improve lignin’s property and control product's distribution. According to the previous reports [10–12], hydroprocess is a common technology for depolymerizing lignin, in which hydrogenolysis is the main reaction on lignin. Meanwhile, lignin also suffers from the hydrogenation, hydrogen atoms transfer into the free radicals of lignin fraction [13]. Hydrogenation not only saturates lignin molecule but also suppresses the recombination of internal free radical and formation of more stubborn char [14,15]. More hydrogenation researches were conducted on model compounds of lignin [16–18]. Noble metal catalysts (Ru, Rh, Pt and Pd) shows a significant catalytic activity for hydrogenolysis of CO ether bonds and hydrogenation of aromatic rings [19,20]. Although model compounds can illustrate basic units and linkage types in the lignin, it cannot substitute the actual folded structure of lignin in the usual sense. There are limited research groups focusing on the solid residue from lignin hydrogenation [21,22]. Most of studies give more attention on liquid products, use high temperature and severe pressure to improve the liquefaction rate. However, Chio et al. mentioned that the temperature above 240 ℃ could enhance the repolymerization of intermediates of lignin molecule [23]. Shen et al. reported that the partly degraded lignin containing abundant aliphatic C–H bonds, and thermal decomposition started to occur even in the low-temperature range(200–280 ℃) [24]. Long et al. investigated the properties of recovered lignin after catalytic decomposition with the synergic function of NaOH and Ru/C. The recovered lignin possessed lower molecular weight and lower degree of unsaturation [25]. The lignin's solubility in various solvents is also one of the major factors that profoundly affect the product distribution of the lignin other than temperature. The solubility of lignin depends on the source of the lignocellulose biomass and the isolation methods. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) shows significant solubility for most types of lignin, which has been commonly used as eluent for GPC (Gel permeation chromatography) measurement. Long’s group compared the depolymerization behavior using THF and aqueous alcohol solvents, and obtained a higher conversion rate in the THF due to its excellent capability of dissolution [26]. So THF was used as a solvent in this work to make sure the totally dispersion of lignin compounds and prevent the alcoholysis effect of alcohols. It is reasonable speculation that lignin can suffer from hydrogenation at such mild temperatures under suitable catalysts, since a mild condition is proved to result in a significant conversion of lignin and suppressed repolymerization [27]. The pretreated lignin having been reduced is a promising feedstock for producing hydrocarbon chemicals through fast pyrolysis. Therefore, in this paper, we constructed a novel and integrated process: catalytic hydrogenation of lignin and subsequent fast pyrolysis of hydrogenated lignin at H2 atmosphere for obtaining more light olefins. This process is dedicated to modify lignin and improve selectivity of pyrolyzed product."
1,Material and methodology,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials THF (99.5 %, with stabilizer), ethanol (99.5 %), acetone solvent and DMSO-d 6 (99.9 %, 047-29071) were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation. Ruthenium on activated carbon (Ru/C, 5 wt.% Ru loading, 908045-10 G), Rhodium on matrix carbon (Rh/C, 5 wt.% Rh loading, 680710-5 G), Chromium (III) acetylacetonate (99.99 %, 574082-5 G) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich, which were vacuum-dried prior to use. KBr powder was obtained from Pike Technologies. Ethanol organosolv lignin (EOL) was extracted through a methodology followed by Cho et al. [28], details shown in supplementary material."
3,Hydrogenation of EOL and separation method,"2.2 Hydrogenation of EOL and separation method Hydrogenation of EOL was carried out as follows. EOL (100 mg), the catalyst (50 mg), and THF solution (20 mL) were mixed and charged into the batch reactor (Parr 4590 Micro Bench Top Reactor, 100 mL) equipped with a four-blade stirrer, pressure and temperature controllers. The reactor was sealed and purged with H2 several times to ensure the absence of oxygen, and then pressurized up to 3 MPa at ambient temperature. The mixture was mechanically stirred at 400 rpm at elevated temperature for a designated time. The temperature and pressure were continuously monitored. After the completion of the hydrogenation, the reactor was quenched with a water bath and rapidly cooled down to room temperature. The procedure was performed with care in order to minimize experimental errors, and reproducibility was confirmed by duplication each run at least two times. The products after hydrogenation were separated by the following procedures (Fig. 1 ). The gaseous products were collected by the syringe while releasing the pressure in the reactor and analyzed by GC-TCD/FID. The catalyst-coke mixture was separated from the solution by centrifugation with 6000 rpm for 10 min and then washed by THF. The solid mixture was vacuum dried at 60 ℃ for 24 h. The filtrate was evaporated to remove all reaction medium. The retained product was named hydrogenated lignin (H-EOL), and then dried in the same manner as above. The yield of H-EOL was calculated as a percentage by weight of EOL fed. The weight difference was caused by coke formation. The unrecovered fraction corresponded to the complement of 100 wt.% of the initial lignin, including oil phase, water, some volatile, and trace gaseous product. Therefore, the yield of products was calculated by the following Eqs. (1–4). (1) C L wt . % = W L - W H / W L * 100 % (2) Y H wt . % = W H / W L * 100 % (3) Y C wt . % = W C / W L * 100 % (4) Y R wt . % = W L - W H - W C / W L * 100 % where, C, Y, and W are respectively the conversion, yield, and weight, and the subscripts L, H, C, and R denote EOL, H-EOL, coke, and the rest products (liquid and gas), respectively."
4,Characterization of products and catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of products and catalysts The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to illustrate the weight loss of lignin by TG curve and revealed the corresponding decomposition rate by DTG (derivative thermogravimetric) curve, which was carried out in Netzsch STA 2500 Regules. Around 5 mg of the sample was loaded on a crucible. The temperature was first raised from room temperature to 100 ℃ with a rate of 5 °C/min, and maintained at 100 ℃ for 30 min. After that, it was heated to 1000 °C at the same heating rate. The thermal decomposition was performed at a constant N2 flow rate of 50 mL/min. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) was used for investigating the internal functional groups of solid samples, employing the Bruker ALPHA Ⅱ. 1 wt.% of lignin in 50 mg of KBr was prepared. The samples were recorded between 400 and 4000 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the absorbance mode. The weight ratio of elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen contained in organic compounds was quantified by elemental analyzer (2400ⅡCHNS/O type manufactured by Perkin Elmer Co., Ltd). The analyzing process was conducted by the column separation method (frontal chromatography) and tested by a TCD. Around 2 mg of samples were detected each time with helium as a carrier gas. The internal structure of lignin samples was determined by 13C and 1H NMR spectra (Bruker AS300). The details and parameters were following the literature [29]. Sample tubes (OD: 5 mm) was running for concentration of the samples 100 mg dissolved in 0.5 ml of DMSO-d 6. 0.01 M of Chromium (III) acetylacetonate was added to the lignin solution as relaxation reagent. The quantitative 13C NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier transformation (FT) mode at 125.7 MHz. The inverse gated decoupling sequence, which allows quantitative analysis and comparison of signal intensities, was used with the following parameters: 30° pulse; 1.4 s acquisition time; 2 s relaxation delay; 64 K data points; and 8000 scans. 1H NMR spectrometer was operated at 500 MHz in FT mode, data acquisition time of about 3.3 s and the number of scans being about 16. Other selection of the operational parameter depends on the nature of 1H NMR spectrometer. The hydrogenation gaseous product was analyzed by GC 2014 (Shimadzu) equipped with TCD (Thermal Conductivity Detector) and FID (flame ionization detector) detectors. The gaseous product mainly composed of CH4 and CO, and trace amounts of CO2 and C2 compounds as well. The total weight of these gaseous compounds was however less than 1 % of the feedstock. The yield of gaseous products was thus neglected. And the volatiles from fast pyrolysis were also detected by the same GC-TCD/FID equipment with same program. Catalysts’ characterization. The crystalline structures of catalyst were detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of a Bruker AXS-D8 X-ray diffractometer for the crystalline structures. A target of Cu Kα radiation was equipped in 2θ range of 10−90° with 0.02°/step. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption was carried out on the BELSORP-Minix analyzer to determine the specific surface area the catalysts. The samples were degassed ahead at 623 K for 3 h in a vacuum to remove surface adsorbed species and moisture on the catalysts. The specific surface area was determined by the adsorption isotherm of nitrogen in the relative pressure range of 0.05 < P/P0 < 0.3, where p is the partial pressure of nitrogen, and p0 is the saturation pressure at the experimental temperature. The specific surface and pore structure characteristics of the catalyst were calculated by the Brunauer − Emmett − Teller (BET) formula and the Barrett − Joyner−Halenda (BJH) formula, respectively."
5,Fast pyrolysis,"2.4 Fast pyrolysis A two-stage tubular reactor (TS-TR), made of quartz with an inner diameter of 4 mm, was used for the fast pyrolysis of lignin. More details about experimental procedure were shown in elsewhere [30,31]. Briefly, about 1 mg of lignin was wrapped every time by a sheet of wire mesh (10 × 10 mm, SUS316 stainless, 45 μm mesh opening), and the wrapped sample was held by a steel wire hook, so that the sample can be located at the upper part of reactor with the help of a magnet on the outside of reactor during installing the experimental setup. The furnace was insulated before increasing the temperature and verified that the entire system was sealed. After the temperature stabilization, the sample was dropped into the bottom of the reactor, where the preliminary reaction of fast pyrolysis happened. The nascent volatiles were swept into the secondary section by a carrier gas, of which the residence time can be controlled by changing the position of the reactor in the furnace. The actual flow rates of helium and hydrogen were 68.2 and 68.5 mL/min, respectively, so that the corresponding gas residence time of 0.45 s was kept constant. The TS-TR was connected with the GC-TCD/FID. The volatiles released from the lignin were immediately blown into a packed column (Gaskuropack 54), after that carried through the TCD and FID sequentially. The quantifications of the products were conducted and calculated based on the external calibration method, the standard gas consisted in CO (1.0 %), CO2 (0.978 %), CH4 (1.01 %), N2 (balance gas). The conditions for TCD and FID were shown in Table S1 [32]. It should be noted that C2H2 and C2H4 are not separated by the column and the yield of C2H2 is included at the olefin yields. The reproducibility was examined, which revealed that the relative errors of the product yield generally within ±5 wt.%."
6,Results and discussion,
7,The feature of feedstock and catalysts,"3.1 The feature of feedstock and catalysts EOL extracted were determined by elemental analysis and fast pyrolysis. The elemental composition of EOL is shown in Table 1 . The obtained values, 68.42 wt.% of carbon and 5.94 wt.% of hydrogen are consistent with reported ones in the literature [33]. The trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen were presented in EOL structure, only 0.12 wt.% and 0.18 wt.%, respectively. And the oxygen content of 25.34 wt.% was estimated by the difference. Figs. S1 and S2 illustrate the GC-TCD/FID chromatograms of volatile products derived from EOL at 850 ℃ with helium and hydrogen as carrier gases. Comparing the chromatograms, it can be visualized that H2 atmosphere has a higher selectivity for low hydrocarbons (C1-C2) and aromatics compounds. And C3-C5 hydrocarbons were further decomposed in the presence of hydrogen. The results of EOL fast pyrolysis are showing in Table 2 . Under helium atmosphere, CO, CO2, and H2O are the leading products within incondensable volatiles, which are caused by the high content of oxygen in the EOL. The yield of methane and ethylene was also high at this condition, caused by immediate breakage of side-chain groups at high temperature [9]. It is worth to notice that only around half of EOL was converted to value-added volatiles, the char yield remained 44.74 wt.% of EOL after pyrolysis. The content of ethylene, propylene and butylene are only 2.94 wt.%, 0.1 wt.% and 0.06 wt.%, respectively. The undetected compounds including condensed liquid products and having longer retention time, account for only 15.82 wt.% of EOL. Xue et al. performed co-pyrolysis of lignin with tetralin and thought that tetralin was used as a hydrogen donor to provoke the decomposition of the lignin and suppress the recombination [34]. Thus, here we changed pyrolysis atmosphere to hydrogen gas to check the product distribution (showing in Table 2). With the stimulation of activated atmosphere, more volatiles were released and recombination was suppressed during the pyrolysis process. Only 17.24 wt.% of EOL remained as char. The yield of CO, H2O, C1-C2 aliphatic compounds and benzene has been enhanced obviously under hydrogen atmosphere, while some trace amounts of products (alcohols, C4H10, acetic acid and toluene) also have slight increasing. The undetected compounds had slightly decreased to 13.51 wt.%, which might be caused by the tar reformation with hydrogen at the secondary reaction. The yield of methane gained a remarkable increase from 6.21 wt.% under helium atmosphere to 21.16 wt.% under hydrogen atmosphere. These are on account of two reasons. One is hydrogen atoms can severely react with free radicals from the cleavage of side chains at high temperature. Another is that char gasification cannot be avoided during the first seconds of fast pyrolysis period, so that conversion rate can be improved with hydrogen. Accordingly, hydrogen can intensely enhance thermal degradation, especially promote further thermal cracking of heavy compounds and formation of light gaseous products. Three commercial catalysts (Raney Nickel, Ru/C, and Ru/C) for the hydrogenation pretreatment were characterized basically (shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2 ) to explain the results of hydrogenation. The specific surface area and pore structure characteristics of the catalysts are illustrated in Table 3. Raney Ni has the smallest specific surface area within them only 0.668 m2/g, while contains 0.02 cm3/g of macro-pore. The properties of large pore size and low pore volume mean that Raney nickel is not a porous structure, and only some large pores formed bumpily on the surface, no internal meso-pore and micro-pore structure formed. The specific surface area is too small may lead to diminish of catalytic activity. On the contrary, Ru/C and Rh/C both contain large specific surface area and same pore volume, which may play a positive role on lignin hydrogenation. As far as the pore structure, it could be observed that the larger pore size of Ru/C contains slightly lower surface area than that of Rh/C. However, a relatively large pore size catalyst is required in this work, so that the lignin molecules can contact the internal catalyst surface for reaction. Fig. 2 shows the XRD profiles of the three catalysts. In Fig. 2(a), Raney Ni shows many crystalline peaks which are including both Ni2Al3 and NiAl3 phase. So, the nickel-aluminum alloy particles are attached to the macroporous surface as crystalline particles. In Fig. 2(b), the diffractograms of Ru/C and Rh/C shows no obvious crystalline peak, which proves that Ru/C and Rh/C are amorphous. The peaks (2θ is around 43°) is corresponding to the Ru-containing and Rh-containing phases respectively. These spectrums of Raney Ni, Ru/C and Rh/C are in agreement with the results in the literature [35,36]."
8,Catalytic hydrogenation of EOL,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of EOL The product distribution after catalytic hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 3 . The influence of catalysts (non, Raney Ni, Ru/C, and Rh/C) on hydrogenation has been observed and shown in Fig. 3(a). The products from hydrogenation without catalysts showed almost no liquefaction occurred, around 98.5 wt.% of the product remained as solid product. EOL partially underwent thermal decomposition and hydrogenation under Raney Ni which has been proved being a good catalyst for hydrogenolysis. Low conversion and less coke formation were observed in the results of hydrogenation under Raney Ni, which is caused by low reactivity of Raney Ni. Hydrogenolysis or hydrogenation can occur only on the macropore surface of Raney Ni, which reduced the catalytic reactivity of hydrogenation and eliminate coke formation. Yet, Ru/C and Rh/C both have high capability toward depolymerization of lignin, recovered 74.85 wt.% and 76.21 wt.% of hydrogenated lignin respectively. The active sites in the large surface area of the catalysts were supplied for hydrogenation [19]. According to the BET results, both Ru/C and Rh/C contain a large surface area, while Ru/C has a relatively larger pore. So that, the conversion rate under Ru/C is slightly high but not obvious. Fig. 3(b) depicts the influence of different solvents (THF, ethanol, acetone) used in the hydrogenation. The solubility is the key factor in this research. Ethanol being widely used for hydrogenolysis of lignin [37,38], from which the H-EOL’s yield was lower than that in another two types of solution due to the alcoholysis of ethanol. Since the increasing dispersion is beneficial to prevent the occurrence of repolymerization, EOL completely dissolved in acetone, has less coke formed and more liquid products obtained. It is consistent with the conclusions of Liu's group [39]. As for THF solvent, the excellent dissolution capacity of THF can facilitate the occurrence of hydrogenation. The coke also accounted for relatively high percentage, because of the recombination of intermediates. Repolymerization of intermediates occurs in parallel with cleavage of lignin connection bonds. In Fig. 3(c), the H-EOL’s yield slightly increased from 74.85 wt.% to 87.11 wt.% with increasing of the reaction time from 1 to 7 h. That is consistent with the conclusion in the literature that increasing simply the reaction time is insufficient for obtaining high yields of monomers [40]. The coke yield also rose significantly when prolonging the time to 7 h. Long reaction time causes condensation of lignin-derived molecules, which is also observed in other literature [41]. The plausible reasons for the high yields of coke are the recombination of intermediates or oligomer compounds which are not stable and easy to form the coke products. As shown in Fig. 3(d), less H-EOL was recovered after increasing the temperature. It is widely accepted that the depolymerization of lignin was the first priority to occur, the internal alkyl-aryl ether bonds suffered from the cleavage, especially under high temperature [14]. Temperature must be the main factor contributed to depolymerization of lignin. Fig. 3(d) shows the depolymerization of EOL is drastically enhanced above 250 °C, only 47.99 wt.% of the H-EOL can be recovered after the reaction."
9,Characterization of H-EOL,"3.3 Characterization of H-EOL In hydrogenation, EOL underwent the decomposition of macromolecular structure and hydrogen transfer, and then converted into H-EOL samples, liquid products, and coke. In order to reveal the effect of hydrogenation on chemical structure of lignin, the characterization of EOL and H-EOL samples obtained under different conditions were studied. Table 4 shows the elemental analysis of EOL and H-EOL samples. The percentages of carbon and hydrogen both increased after the hydrogenation with and without the catalysts. At the same time, the yield of oxygen severely reduced, which means the pretreating process is effective for lignin to increase the hydrogen content and reduce the oxygenated compounds. The hydrogen to carbon atomic effective ratio (H/Ceff ratio) and degree of unsaturation (Ω) were calculated and shown in Table 4. H/Ceff ratio was introduced by Vispute and his groups [42], which is related to the yield of aromatic and olefins. Catalytic hydrogenation can significantly raise H/Ceff ratio of lignin to 0.70 and decrease Ω to 3.37 under the function of Ru/C catalyst, even higher under Rh/C. Pan and co-workers also found that in a course of preheating Hami sub-bituminous coal, the addition of hydrogen sources achieved to raise the hydrogen-to-carbon ratios and the thermal reactivity of solid residue [43]. Ru/C and Rh/C both exhibited the excellent performance for hydrogenation with high activity. FTIR spectroscopy of EOL and H-EOL samples are shown in Fig. 4 . According to the FTIR spectra assignment (Table S2) [44], the peak in the range of 3000−3600 cm−1 is assigned to the OH stretching in phenolic and aliphatic groups. The decreasing of OH group proved that the hydrodeoxygenation reaction took place. The ether linkages (β-O-4, α-O-4 and 4-O-5) are weaker and easier to be cleaved than CC bonds (β-1, α-1 and 5’-5) considering the bond dissociation enthalpies [45]. Thus, the peaks of CO ether (1212−1224 cm−1), hydroxyl group, and carbonyl group (1674−1709 cm−1) obviously decreased after hydrogenation. And aliphatic (−CH3, −CH2, CC) group was the only functional group increased after hydrogenation, which is in agreement with the conclusion of Iretskii’ s group [13]. They suggested that the elevated number of aliphatic groups means ring alkylation may occur concurrently with the reduction. It reveals the occurrence dominate of alkylation, which was proved to be produced even in oil phase [46]. Elemental results in this work are consistent with the above descriptions. As observed in Fig. 4(a), compared with non-catalyst, the synergetic effects of Ru/C catalyst and THF might suppress the depolymerization of lignin and improve the stretching vibration of aliphatic groups, which proved well the occurrence of alkylation [47]. Reaction time shows less effect on the functional groups than catalysts (in Fig. 4(b)). Slightly reduction of oxygenated groups has been observed on H-EOL when increasing the reaction time. The reaction time longer than 3 h could result in the slightly grown-up of aromatic group’s and aliphatic group’s vibration. Chemical assignments for major peaks in 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra are according to the literature [29], showing in Tables S3 and S4 respectively. Figs. 5 and 6 are showing 1H NMR patterns of EOL and H-EOL, respectively. The 1H nuclei in lignins present in similar but not identical, and chemical environments give rise to intensive overlap of signals in a spectra, so that the presence of carbohydrates would make the spectra even more complex [48]. According to Table S3, the signals in the range of 2.2–2.5 ppm, 3.5−4 ppm, and 6.1–8.0 ppm are assigned to aromatic acetate, hydrogen in the methoxyl groups of aromatic acetylated substructures and connection bonds (β-O-4, β-β, β-1and C-α), as well as aromatic region, respectively. It is apparent that the intensity of above signals has a sharp decrease after hydrogenation, especially the intensity of the peak for hydrogen in methoxyl groups and connection bonds. The reason might be related to the cleavage of ether bonds and demethoxylation reaction of syringyl (S) type units and guaiacyl (G) units during this process. Combined with above characterization, the content of aliphatic −OH diminished, while −COOH group (2.5−3 ppm) increased during the depolymerization. The decrease of aromatic region and no change of aliphatic region (0.7–2.2 ppm) maybe due to the following reasons: (1) hydrogenation of raw lignin also formed cyclohexanes, which also decrease aromatic region and generate signal of aliphatic; (2) side chains in lignin cleaved and/or rearranged under the hydrogenation process. The 13C NMR spectra of EOL and H-EOL are demonstrated in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. Generally, DMSO-d 6 is acquired at around 40 ppm of 13C NMR spectra. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the 13C NMR intensity of H-EOL is stronger than that of EOL, which might be attributed to the sensitivity of 13C NMR is too low for macromolecular cross-linked compounds. So that, the peaks of spectroscopy (Fig. 7) are limited, even preparing high concentration of lignin solution for detection. However, it can be seen that the spectrum of H-EOL shows many peaks, which should be due to partial depolymerization of lignin through pretreatment, and the structure of H-EOL becomes more obvious and detectable. The signals in the range of 60−72 ppm, 110−120 ppm, and 145−152 ppm appear apparent spectral peaks, which all represent carbon in G type units. It is probably attributable to the fact that S type units were more susceptible to perform demethoxylation reaction than G type units [24]. Furthermore, the aliphatic region (15–29.1 ppm) also shows significantly in H-EOL’s spectra, in agreement with the corresponding FTIR spectroscopy. Thermal degradation of lignin is mainly related to its inherent structure and the internal functional groups. Further characterization of lignin samples after hydrogenation is presented by TG and DTG curve. As shown in Fig. 9 , the TG and DTG curves of H-EOL samples were totally different from those of EOL. For the DTG curve of EOL, the main degradation process can be clearly seen occurred in the wide range of 200–600 ℃. But for H-EOL, the DTG curve was separated into three stages. The first stage was 100–150 ℃, which was attributed to the dehydration of inherent moisture or the cleavage of hydroxyl groups [49]. When the temperature increases to 150–300 ℃, there is another small peak showed, which is different from the EOL. This is attributed to the occurrence of catalytic depolymerization and presence of lignin fragments during hydrogenation. According to the modification scheme proposed by Hrutfiord [50], hydrolysis and thermolysis reactions are the initial step that partially break down the lignin into fragments. The third is the major decomposition stage in the range of 300–600 ℃, which is severe than that of EOL. In Fig. 9(a), the DTG curves of H-EOL samples with and without Ru/C have similar decomposition period. However, the peaks’ intensity of the H-EOL obtained with catalyst were higher than that without catalyst. From the TG curve, the yield of char residue decreased from 50 wt.% of EOL to 32 wt.% of H-EOL after hydrogenation with Ru/C. After pretreating the lignin samples with hydrogenation process, fewer residues were remained in the thermal depolymerization process. Owing to the catalyst, lignin oligomers formed which can be easily suffered from thermal decomposition at lower temperature. The influence of reaction time on thermal degradation of lignin samples is shown in the Fig. 9(b). Further increasing reaction time to 7 h has limited effect on the TG and DTG curves of H-EOL. The reaction time does not dramatically change the decomposition properties of H-EOL samples, which is in accord with above characterization of H-EOL samples."
10,The pyrolysis properties of H-EOL,"3.4 The pyrolysis properties of H-EOL Under different hydrogenation conditions, the chemical properties and molecular structure of solid products are various. The pyrolyzed products from EOL and H-EOL were detected by GC-TCD/FID, shown in Table 5 . Fast pyrolysis of EOL and H-EOL samples were all performed at 850 ℃ under hydrogen atmosphere. H-EOL1 recovered from the hydrogenation in the absence of catalyst mainly suffered from depolymerization of side chains. Therefore, less yield of CO, CO2, H2O and CH4 than that of EOL and obviously yielding the char to 25.24 wt.% have been observed here. Compared with H-EOL1, the other H-EOL samples had higher thermal activity after hydrogenation, the char yield of both H-EOL2 and H-EOL3 even decreased to around 10 wt.%. The inorganic oxygenated products (CO2 and H2O) from H-EOL2 and H-EOL3 decreased lower than that from H-EOL1. The C1-C3 hydrocarbons, benzene, and toluene from H-EOL2 and H-EOL3 have further increased to a similar percentage. Ru/C and Rh/C has similar catalytic function on hydrogenation, which is in accordance with the elemental analysis and FTIR spectra of H-EOL. When further increasing the hydrogenation temperature to 250 ℃ (H-EOL4 and H-EOL5), the char yield increased to 14.29 wt.% and 15.38 wt.%, respectively. It proves that the H-EOL samples have being pretreated under higher temperature suffered from more cleavage of functional groups and became more stable. The yield of hydrocarbon compounds from H-EOL4 has increased after pretreating at 250 ℃ for 3 h, and has slight further increase with increasing the reaction time to 7 h (see the results of H-EOL5). Jongerius et al. also got conclusion that higher amounts of deoxygenated products could be obtained with the increase of hydrogenation time and temperature [41]. The total olefins’ yield went up to maximum value (9.94 wt.%) from H-EOL5, mostly composed of ethylene whose selectivity went to 97.08 %. It is thus suggested that the hydrogenation can increase the thermal reactivity and selectivity of hydrocarbon products. It is possibly attributed to the increasing of H/Ceff ratio in the lignin molecules, proposed by Vispute’s research group [42]. However, the further severe condition will enhance the liquefaction of lignin and the formation of coke. Therefore, appropriate hydrogenation conditions should be designed to well pretreat raw lignin. A more intuitive comparison is shown in Fig. 10 . Considered about solid yield from hydrogenation and olefins yield from fast pyrolysis, H-EOL4 recovered from the hydrogenation condition (250 ℃, 3 h, THF, Ru/C, 3 MPa H2) was chosen to compare with EOL here. The yield of alkanes and olefins has been found to increase simultaneously and obviously, methane and ethylene are the main compounds in these two groups respectively. Caballero et al. also claimed that the formation of ethylene is linearly correlated with that of methane, and methane formation is favored at low yields of CO and CO2 [51]. Except that, the aromatics (benzene and toluene) yield also increased from 5.85 wt.% of EOL to 7.81 wt.% of H-EOL4. The inorganic compounds, including CO, CO2 and H2O, had a sharp reduction after hydrogenation due to the cleavage of side chain groups. Formation of the oxygenated compounds (CH3OH, C2H5OH, iso-propanol, acetic acid) is mainly attributed to the increased carbonyl groups, and reacted with hydrogen atoms in subsequent fast pyrolysis process. There (in Table 6 ) listed some recent literature about using catalytic fast pyrolysis to improve the selectivity of products, where zeolite-type catalysts proving to be the most selective for olefins and aromatic hydrocarbon products. We can see, without catalyst (Entry 1), only trace amount of olefins can be obtained and 56.4 wt.% of kraft lignin was transferred into useless char. With HZSM-5 catalyst (Entry 7), the olefins and aromatics yield slightly increased to 1.3 wt.% and 0.78 wt.%, while char yield also increased. In these literature, the highest olefins’ yield is 5.3 wt.% and yield of benzene and toluene is 2.23 wt.%, which is catalyzed by 6 wt.% La/HZSM-5 (Entry 2). In this work, the lignin pretreated under hydrogenation can produce 9.94 wt.% of light olefins and 8.39 wt.% of benzene and toluene. The hydrogenation process as a pretreatment, changes the structure of the lignin, and partial depolymerization as well as reduction makes the H-EOL more suitable as a pyrolysis feedstock. Low polymerization and high H/Ceff ratio allows to produce more olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons. This method seems to be more efficient than catalytic fast pyrolysis to obtain olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons."
11,The proposed reaction pathways,"3.5 The proposed reaction pathways Combination of above findings, the proposed reaction scheme of lignin hydrogenation is illustrated in Scheme 1 . There are three kinds of parallel process for catalytic hydrogenation of raw lignin. Hydrogenolysis predominately happened on the ether bonds (β-O-4, α-O-4 and 4-O-5), the hydrogen atoms were then added into free radicals [55]. In this process, phenolic intermediates were formed, which was subsequently followed hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Hydrogenation might happen on aromatic rings or CO groups through catalysis of Ru/C, the extent of which is dictated by the free energy barrier for this pathway and the availability of catalyst’s active sites on the surface. It should be noted that the occurrence of hydrolysis or hydrodeoxygenation is the main reason for decreasing of oxygen, like, −OH group and −OCH3 group especially in S type units. Nevertheless, higher bond dissociation energies of Caryl-methoxyl bonds than those of CO bonds in aryl ethers makes the rate of demethoxylation slower than decomposition of connection bonds [14]."
12,Conclusions,"Hydrogenation is a promising technology to change the structure and modify the chemical properties of lignin. The present study checked characterization of the H-EOL under different hydrogenation conditions, and investigated the thermal decomposition properties of H-EOL. The following conclusions were drawn. (1) The yield of H-EOL showed a direct correlation with catalysts, solvent, time, and temperature. Among them, temperature was a crucial parameter for yielding the solid product. The H-EOL yield sharply decreased from 87.11–47.99 wt.% when the hydrogenation temperature increased from 200 to 250 ℃, which signifies higher temperature encourages more cleavage of internal linkages and functional groups. (2) Compared with EOL, the H/Ceff ratio of H-EOL samples has an increase. The content of oxygen and sulfur significantly decreased after pretreatment due to the thermal decomposition of ether bonds and side chain groups. The vibrational stretching of OH groups CO, and CO of H-EOL becomes weaker, while the aliphatic group is the only functional groups increased after hydrogenation. This phenomenon can be more pronounced in response to higher temperature and longer reaction time. Hydrogenolysis of ether bonds, hydrodeoxygenation of hydroxyl group, demethoxylation and alkylation happened in the hydrogenation process successively (3) EOL can produce more light hydrocarbons through the fast pyrolysis at hydrogen atmosphere. Activated atmosphere can promote the thermochemical decomposition. Almost all compounds except CO2 detected by GC-TCD/FID were intensively yielded. Less char was remained after pyrolysis under hydrogen atmosphere, since the hydrogen can react with the intermediates and suppress the repolymerization. (4) The TGA results signify that H-EOL samples have higher reactivity which can be easily decomposed at relatively low temperature. At the same time, fast pyrolysis of H-EOL samples has been checked, in which the maximum yield of light olefins is 9.94 wt.% from H-EOL5. Moreover, the yield of methane, alkane, benzene, and toluene also has a marked increase after hydrogenation pretreatment. The effective hydrogenation pretreatment can valorize lignin sample. More than 85 wt.% of H-EOL can be converted into volatiles. (5) Considering about the H-EOL yield of hydrogenation and the product distribution of fast pyrolysis, the hydrogenation condition for H-EOL4 is considered as a picked condition. When time was further prolonged (H-EOL5), only around half of feedstock can be recovered as solid product from hydrogenation. Thus, more effective pretreatment conditions are required. Suppressing liquefaction of lignin and modification of lignin structure would be further looked forward. That should be the outlook of future work for this integrated process."
