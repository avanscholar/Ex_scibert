0,Introduction,"Over the past few decades, development of the automotive industries leaded to a sudden increase in number of vehicles which faced the human society with problems such as air pollution, the gradual completion of fossil fuels, and the effect of rising greenhouse emissions from vehicles [1,2]. Therefore, finding proper alternatives for the combustion engine has become to an interesting research subjects [3–5]. Among many new suggested technologies for abatement of vehicles emissions, fuel cell is known as a promising solution. The major problem for the application of fuel cells especially for vehicles is the supply of hydrogen as their feed [6,7]. Due to safety issues of hydrogen storage in cars, the best solution for its supplement seems through a reaction with liquid feed [8–10]. Steam reforming of hydrocarbons such as natural gas, alcohols and gasoline is a promising pathway for production of hydrogen [11–14]. Conversion of alcohols and hydrocarbons, facilitate the production of on board hydrogen [15–17]. Although, for industrial production of hydrogen, methane is used as the main fuel, but considering mobile vehicles prefers liquid fuels. Compared to other liquid fuels, methanol has attracted attention due to its several advantages [18–23]. Methanol as the simplest alcohol, has no carbon–carbon bonds in its molecular structure which makes its conversion possible at lower temperatures and less coke formation [24]. Moreover, its other advantages can be nominated such as biodegradable, high ratio of hydrogen to carbon, low boiling point, low hazardous level, and inexpensive [25,26]. Production of methanol from synthesis gas is the most common method of manufacturing methanol. Methanol can be converted to hydrogen through partial oxidation, steam reforming, decomposition and autothermal reforming reactions. Among these, the steam reforming of methanol reaction (SRM), due to its higher yield of hydrogen and lower generation of CO that know as the poison of the fuel cell catalysts is the best way for producing hydrogen [27–32]. The SRM Reaction (R1) take place along with two possible side reactions, methanol decomposition (R2) and water gas shift (WGS) Reaction (R3). (R1) CH3OH+H2 ↔CO2 +3H2 ΔH298 =49.4KJ/mol (R2) CH3OH↔CO+2H2 ΔH298 =90.4KJ/mol (R3) CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2 ΔH298 =−41.4KJ/mol The SRM catalysts can be classified into two major categories based on their active phase: copper based catalysts and the 8–10 group catalysts. Copper-base catalysts, because of their high activity and selectivity, are the common catalysts for SRM process [33–36]. As the SRM is a catalytic adsorption reaction, preparation of catalysts with high surface area and Cu species dispersion as well as fine particle size to improve the reaction activity has been taken into account. The commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) catalyst which contains high loading of Cu and ZnO and relatively lower amount of Al2O3, has been used most widely in SRM [37]. Parameters such as synthesis method as well as suitable promoters can efficiently influence on physicochemical and catalytic properties of synthesized catalysts. Zinc oxide is known as an effective promoter for Cu based catalysts that can effect on dispersion and redox properties of the copper species and is responsible for strong metal support interaction. Alumina is the most common structural promoter for increasing the surface area and preventing Cu sintering, but its small amount is usually recommends because higher values can promote the production of formaldehyde as the by-product. Moreover, other promoters are suggested for improvement of CZA catalysts such as ceria, zirconia, lanthania, magnesia and etc. Addition of ZrO2 to the conventional CZA catalysts improved the SRM activity [19]. It also promoted the reducibility and dispersion of copper and had similar effects on ZnO [38]. In terms of synthesis methods, the precipitation method is the most common pathway for synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts [39]. But, aggregation of precipitated particles due to their uncontrollable size is one of its major drawbacks. This problem can be overcome by some modification in synthesis procedure such as application of ultrasonic irradiation during the coprecipitation method [40]. The advantages of nanocatalysts prepared by the Sonochemical coprecipitation method are enhancement of the specific surface area, metal dispersion lead to better catalytic performance. Moreover, it can be performed fast and facile without any complicated facilities. Acoustic cavitation phenomena is the major reason for interpretation of chemical effects of waves created by ultrasound irradiation. High local operational conditions (high temperatures up to 12,000°C and pressure about 10,000atm) are achieved by the collapse of cavitation bubbles due to several acoustic cycles. Such high temperatures and pressures can facilitate the proceeding of the reaction by breaking the chemical bonds [41]. Bursting of bubbles occurs in less than a nanosecond, so this sudden changes in temperature prevents the agglomeration of particles with high purity in complex metal oxides [42]. According to the literature, the application of ultrasound energy during coprecipitation of CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 catalysts for SRM has not been yet studied comprehensively. Therefore, this study is discussed the effect of sonication power on properties of CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 nanocatalysts. Characteristic analyses such as XRD, BET, FESEM, FTIR and EDX were used to investigate the physicochemical properties of synthesized nanocatalysts. Finally, the prepared nanocatalysts were tested in a fixed bed reactor system for evaluation of their catalytic performance."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Raw materials used in the preparation stage, great influence on the final properties of the nanocatalysts are synthesized. Copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Merck, extra pure), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn (NO3)2·6H2O, Merck, extra pure), zirconium nitrate hexahydrate (Zr (NO3)2·6H2O, Merck, extra pure) and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al (NO3)3·9H2O, Merck, extra pure) as a precursor of the metal and sodium carbonate as precipitation alkaline purchased from Merck and without any preparation, have been used in the synthesis catalyst. At all stages of the synthesis, distilled water is used as the synthesis environment. All materials without any additional purification operations have been used."
3,Nanocatalysts preparation and procedure,"2.2 Nanocatalysts preparation and procedure Fig. 1 illustrates schematically the procedure used for preparation of the CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 nanocatalyst which can be divided to three main steps: precursor preparation, ultrasound-assisted coprecipitation synthesis method, heat treatment and catalyst forming. At first step, 1M solution of metal nitrate precursors with an atomic ratio of Cu/Zn/Zr/Al=50/30/10/10 and 1M sodium carbonate solution in a gutter were mixed, while the pH and the temperature were kept in the range of 7–8 and 70–80°C, respectively. The resulted solution was mixed under ultrasound with different powers for 45min (Fig. 2 ). A SONOPULS HD 3200, 130mm diameter Ti horn was applied for the sonication treatment. The Ti horn was inserted 1cm below the slurry to apply high intensive irradiation to the solution. Precipitates were separated from the slurry by filtration and washed to assure the absence of interfering ions like Na+. The resulted precipitate was dried for 12h at 110°C. The prepared powder was calcined at 350°C for 5h. Before loading in a fixed bed reactor, the synthesized catalysts formed as tiny cylindrical shapes. Fabricated nanocatalysts were named as CZZA-P0, CZZA-P30, CZZA-P60, and CZZA-P90 in which to describe the ultrasonic power was applied in synthesis procedure."
4,Nanocatalysts characterization techniques,"2.3 Nanocatalysts characterization techniques The crystallography of samples was investigated by application of a D5000 Siemens X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Its working voltage and the current were 30kV and 40mA, respectively. The Scherrer equation was used to calculate the average crystallite size of samples by following equation: D =0.90λ/β cos θ where λ, D, β and θ are the wavelength, the crystallite size (nm), the corrected full width at half maximum (radian) and the Bragg angle (radian), respectively. Microstructure, particle size and morphology of CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 composite were analyzed by a HITACHI 4160-s Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). The elemental analysis of samples was performed by EDX-dot mapping (VEGA II, TESCAN). The specific surface area of samples were measured by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique (Quantachrome ChemBET 3000) by using nitrogen adsorption at 77K and desorption at room temperature. Before measurement, the samples were degassed at 200°C for 30min. The functional groups of synthesized nanocatalysts were identified by a Unicam 4000 FTIR spectrometer using KBr plate."
5,Experimental setup for catalytic performance test,"2.4 Experimental setup for catalytic performance test Fig. 3 illustrates the experimental setup for catalytic tests of synthesized nanocatalysts which consists of feed gas cylinders, mass flow controllers, a saturator, a reactor, an electrical furnace and a gas chromatograph system. A U-shape Pyrex fixed bed reactor (5mm i.d.) was loaded with 400mg of fabricated nanocatalysts to evaluate their catalytic performance over a temperature range of 160–300°C and at atmospheric pressure. At first, nanocatalysts should be reduced by a 100ml/min stream of 15% vol of H2 in Ar mixture flowed at 300°C for 3h. A saturator contained methanol and water (MeOH/H2O=1.5) solution was used to feed the reactants vapour into the fixed bed reactor. The saturator was kept in an ice-water bath at 0°C. An argon stream was injected to the saturated to carry the feed into the reactor. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was fixed at 10,000ml/ gcat h by mass flow controller (MFC) in the argon stream. A gas chromatograph apparatus (GC Chrom, Teif Gostar Faraz, Iran) was applied to measure the composition of the reactants and products. It was equipped by a Plot-U column (Agilent) as well as TCD and FID detectors. The conversion of methanol and selectivity of the products has been defined as follows: (1) X CH 3 OH % = F CH 3 OH i n − F CH 3 OH o u t F CH 3 OH i n × 100 (2) S H 2 % = F H 2 o u t F H 2 o u t + F CO o u t + F CO 2 o u t × 100 (3) S CO % = F CO o u t F H 2 o u t + F CO o u t + F CO 2 o u t × 100 (4) S CO 2 % = F CO 2 o u t F H 2 o u t + F CO o u t + F CO 2 o u t × 100 where Fi is the flow rate of component i in the gaseous effluent."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Nanocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Nanocatalysts characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis Fig. 4 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of CZZA nanocatalysts synthesized by the sonochemically assisted coprecipitation method by different ultrasonic irradiation powers. Significant peaks of monoclinic CuO (JCPDS 01-080-1268) can be observed at 2θ=35.5, 35.6, 38.8, 38.9, 48.8, 61.6 and 68.2°. The main characteristic peaks of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS 01-076-0704) appear at 2θ=31.7, 34.4, 36.2, 47.5, 56.5, 62.8, 67.9 and 69.0° and a weak peak at 2θ=30.2 is related to ZrO2 (JCPDS 01-080-0784). As can be seen in Table 1 , the crystallite size of CuO specie is reduced from 22.8 to 7.9nm by increasing the power of ultrasound while the size of ZnO is measured about 20.6nm. It can be noted that alumina phase cannot be detected, because of its small quantities or amorphous phase. This analysis proves that different ultrasonic power clearly influence on crystallites size of synthesized nanocatalysts. Copper oxide has sharper peaks in CZZA-P0 sample. Enhancement of ultrasonic power can reduce the peak intensity and leads to homogeneous nucleation and prevents the growth of the crystals and aggregations. Application of sonication led to decrease of CuO crystallinity by increasing ultrasonic power. So, it describes that CuO crystal size decreases while its dispersion improves at higher irradiation powers. Dispersion of active metals on nanocatalyst surface is a key parameter for catalytic performance. According to the above mentioned analysis, CZZA-P90 sample seems to have the highest activity due to its high Cu dispersion. The literature [43] states that CuO and ZnO interaction play an important role on the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts. Copper oxide crystals become smaller at high ultrasonic powers, so their interaction with ZnO crystals becomes stronger. Due to low calcination temperature or good dispersion, the ZrO2 species had low crystallinity which is in good agreement with previous works [44]. No diffraction peaks ascribed to ZnAl2O4 or CuAl2O4 spinels were detected, because of the moderate calcination conditions. According to the results of XRD analysis, due to the smaller crystals of copper in the sample CZZA-P90, it may show better catalytic performance. 3.1.2 FESEM analysis Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images illustrate the morphology of synthesized catalyst surface. Furthermore, the surface size distribution study was applied by ImageJ software. Particles agglomeration can be nominated as the main reason for deactivation of copper based catalysts. On the other hand, the size of particles can influence efficiently on the catalytic activity of Cu based catalyst for steam reforming of methanol. To discuss the effect of utilization of ultrasonic power on decrease of agglomerates and particle size, Fig. 5 shows the FESEM image of CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 catalysts were fabricated by the sonochemically assisted coprecipitation method at different powers. At first, it can be concluded that the formed particles in all samples are nanometer. But the particles of samples prepared by ultrasound assisted coprecipitation method are smaller and more homogeneous than CZZA-P0 sample. In this situation, the nucleation and growth of particles can be taken place in a uniform environment provided by the synergistic effect between sonication and coprecipitation. This positive effect can simultaneously prevent the particle agglomeration on the surface of catalysts. Moreover, enhancement of ultrasonic power led to more uniform morphology as well as highly dispersed particles. This is because of higher nucleation rates during precipitation. The FESEM micrographs of the CZZA-P90 indicate that their particles are tiny spheres due to high nucleation rate. It was expected that nanocatalysts synthesized by conventional coprecipitation has broader particle size distribution with drastic agglomeration of particles which was modified by application of sonochemistry method. It seems that applied power (90W) is high enough to prevent formation of agglomerates and hence increase the dispersion of particles which can cause better catalytic performance. Fig. 6 illustrates the surface size distribution histogram and TEM image for the CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 nanocatalyst synthesized by the ultrasound coprecipitation method at 90W and 45min. This surface analysis is prepared by applying FESEM images and using ImageJ software. The result shows that the nanocatalyst particle size is mostly (82%) smaller than 100nm. Moreover, the average particle size is about 77.3nm. The minimum and maximum size of nanocatalyst particles were 37.6 and 164.7nm, respectively. So, it statistically proves our claims about influence of enhancement of ultrasonic power on decrease of particle size which was mentioned above. Furthermore, TEM micrograph proves the claim about nanometric particles formed in the CZZA-P90 sample. Also, large and long grains were not seen and aggregation of small particles was not seen in the TEM image of CZZA-P90. The composition comparison between point 1 and 2 illustrates that darker point has more CuO species than light ones. So, it can be concluded that copper based active phase in nanometer scale is found in nanocatalyst prepared at maximum irradiation power. Moreover, these nanoparticles are completely dispersed on fabricated nanocatalyst surface. On the other hand, no individual separated oxide particles can be easily distinguished and all metal oxides are partially embedded in the oxide matrix which indicates the good interaction between metal oxides especially CuO and ZnO species. Consequently, TEM micrograph confirms nanoscale structure of CZZA-P90 with appropriate interaction of components which predicted this nanocatalyst with high active phase dispersion may indicate good catalytic activity in the SRM process. 3.1.3 EDX analysis Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is applied to analyze locally the distribution of elements on the catalysts surface in Fig. 7 . As can be seen every elements were used in the initial solution is existed according to EDX analysis. In addition it shows that, although other analyses such as XRD could not detect the presence of alumina or zirconia properly, their existence can be proved by the EDX analysis. Its results show that alumina and zirconia element on the surface of metal oxide well spread. The good dispersion of active phase can be impressively detected in CZZA-P90 sample which Cu and Zn species were homogeneously dispersed on catalyst surface. Fig. 8 shows the comparison of the primary solution and the nanocatalyst surface composition by EDX results. The surface composition of fabricated samples is similar to the primary solution. So, it can be demonstrated that the active phase of Cu and Zn and Zr are suitably dispersed on the surface of the nanocatalysts according to the calculations preformed for the primary solution. 3.1.4 BET analysis The steam reforming of methanol is a surface adsorption reaction which is mainly dependent on the specific surface area of the nanocatalyst. The specific surface area values of synthesized nanocatalysts are listed in Table 1. High ultrasonic power enhances nucleation rate and subsequently prepared smaller and highly dispersed particles and consequently higher surface area nanocatalysts. Therefore, it can be predicted that CZZA-P90 sample has the highest surface area among other nanocatalysts. Small size of the copper oxide crystals, homogeneous morphology and no agglomerate, as well as nanometer particles of the CZZA-P90 catalyst are the main reasons to expect higher surface area than other samples. So, the results of BET analysis is in accordance of FESEM analysis. Therefore, it is expected that CZZA-P90 sample, with the highest effective surface area, shows better catalytic performance in the reactor tests. 3.1.5 FTIR analysis The functional groups of nanocatalysts were identified by application of FTIR analysis which its results are shown in Fig. 9 . The behaviour of all samples is similar and notices that their functional groups are same. Usually, the peaks in the range 400–675cm−1 can be study for identification of metal oxides existence. In details, the peaks at 500 and 1384cm−1 correspond to the presence of OCuO while alumina existence causes appearance of peak near 582cm−1 wave number. The peak demonstrated at 2350cm−1 can be related to absorb CO2 [1,45,46]. More precisely, the bands near 435cm−1 are related to existence of ZnO species. In addition, bands at 1400, 1600 and 3450cm−1 can be assigned to hydroxide group which is absorbed from the atmosphere or the water in the structure of the catalyst [41,47,48]. Interlayer water molecules are also detected by bands at 1640cm−1 which may be remained from synthesis stage [49–51]. In none of the samples detected peak for zinc hydroxide and copper impurities cannot be seen."
8,Reaction mechanism of nanocatalysts formation,"3.2 Reaction mechanism of nanocatalysts formation Coprecipitation is the conventional method for preparation of heterogeneous catalysts. Its main problem is the agglomeration of precipitated particles which is resulted of weak control on formed particles size. So, application of sonochemistry is suggested in this work to reduce grained nanocrystalline size. Fig. 10 shows the suggested a route for synthesis of CuO in CZZA by the sonication assisted coprecipitation process. The pathways for the ZrO2 and Al2O3 species are the same. After irradiation with the sonicator, precursors decompose and water radicals like H and OH produce which can easily react with substrate. For example, OH radicals can react with metal cations and produces metal hydroxides. These metal hydroxides can convert to metal oxides during thermal treatment. On the other hand, in the coprecipitation route sodium carbonate as the precipitant reacts with metal nitrates and metal carbonates are synthesized. Ultrasound irradiation can improve the coprecipitation method through four ways: (1) OH radicals that produce from the sonolysis of water can independently convert metal nitrates to metal oxides apart from the coprecipitation reaction. (2) In the normal synthesis situation different phases of nanocatalysts fully dispersed by the cavity collapse nucleation happened by sonication. (3) The size of the particles is so smaller than the simple coprecipitation because of the irradiation cycles. (4) Particles agglomeration was banned by application of ultrasound irradiation. Generally, by increasing ultrasonic power, higher temperature and pressure leads to increase cavities that produce more OH radicals that accelerate synthesis of reactions and synthesis yield."
9,Catalytic performance study toward methanol steam reforming,"3.3 Catalytic performance study toward methanol steam reforming 3.3.1 Methanol conversion Fig. 11 depicts the methanol conversion of synthesized CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 at different temperatures ranges of 160–300°C. On the whole temperature ranges, nanocatalyst synthesized at 90W was more active in converting of methanol and shows the best performance. As illustrated in this figure, CZZA-P90 which synthesized by higher ultrasonic power has higher methanol conversion. This result is because of its better physicochemical properties of CZZA-90 sample such as small particle size, good dispersion of active sites, high specific surface area and homogeneous morphology with no agglomerates. 3.3.2 Products selectivity Fig. 12 shows the product selectivity of fabricated CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 nanocatalysts with different ultrasonic power. It can be seen that almost all prepared catalysts, have high ratio of hydrogen to carbon dioxide. But the most important note is their capability of producing carbon monoxide as the undesired product. The CZZA-P30 sample had the considerable amount of carbon monoxide which gradually decreased by enhancement of ultrasonic power. The main factor in the production of carbon monoxide in the steam reforming of methanol reaction is the reverse water- gas shift (RWGS) reaction. In addition, in some cases the direct methanol decomposition reaction can also facilitate the production of carbon monoxide. According to Zuo et al. direct methanol decomposition on a clean Cu(111) facet can be described as follows: C H 3 O H → C H 3 O → C H 2 O → C H O → C O [52]. This pathway is quite similar to SRM mechanism till the formaldehyde production from methoxy species. But, it is important to notice that the suitable active sites for direct methanol decomposition and RWGS reactions are different in their size. This means that the suitable active sites for the reverse water gas shift reaction are smaller than the direct methanol decomposition ones [53]. On the other hand, smaller Cu based sites are more appropriate for dissociative adsorption of water molecules which facilitates existence of hydroxyl and atomic oxygen species on the nanocatalysts surface [54]. Presence of hydroxyl and atomic oxygen on Cu(111) facets improves the reaction of formaldehyde and hydroxyl species to form hydroxymethoxy species followed by its dissociation to CO2 [52]. Therefore, by applying the power of 30W for the ultrasound irradiation, proper copper sites for the direct methanol decomposition reaction were prepared as well as low formation of hydroxyl and atomic oxygen species as promoters for production of hydroxymethoxy species. It should be noted that in addition to production of CO from direct decomposition of methanol this was also formed from the RWGS reaction. Thus, the production of carbon monoxide was driven in these two ways. But, gradually by increasing ultrasound power the active sites become much smaller which are not suitable for the direct methanol decomposition and therefore, production of carbon monoxide carried out only by the RWGS reaction. So, the CO amount decreased significantly in these nanocatalysts. 3.3.3 Time on stream performance Catalyst stability test was taken place, at 200°C and atmospheric pressure, space velocity 1000cm3/gcat h and the water to methanol ratio of 1.5. Zirconia as promoter increased ability to adsorbed methanol and stabilize the catalyst. Fig. 13 shows the methanol conversion and selectivity of H2 and CO2 and CO for 24h. This figure clearly proves the good stability of nanocatalysts which fabricated by ultrasound assisted coprecipitation method for production of hydrogen from methanol during long time. As can be seen, the methanol conversion of CZZA-P90 nanocatalyst did not decrease and remained 100% after 24h. Addition of zirconia to the nanocatalyst CZZA due to surface oxygen sites in the oxidizing properties of zirconia fleas, improved catalyst stability as well as active phase dispersion and prevent agglomeration of the active phase."
10,Reaction mechanism of methanol steam reforming,"3.4 Reaction mechanism of methanol steam reforming Fig. 14 shows the proposed reaction mechanism for the steam reforming of methanol on the CZZA catalyst surface. The reactions start by adsorption and decomposition of methanol and water on the catalyst surface. Adsorption and decomposition of the methanol on the crystal plates Cu (1 0 0) and Cu (1 1 0) leading to produce the methoxy species. The adsorbed sites of oxygen on the catalyst surface, increases the possibility of methoxy groups. Based on the type of active site, the reactive path to become more methoxy recommended, both of which ultimately lead to the production of formate species. Formate can pass two different reaction pathways. In one way formate decomposed to CO and OH that CO reacts with the oxygen site and produced CO2 or formate directly decomposed to CO2 and hydrogen surface sites that in here we show the first path. With the reaction between surface hydrogen, hydrogen gas as the main product and our desired level is released from the surface. Due to the fact that copper-based catalysts exhibit high activity for the water gas shift reaction, CO2 is produced on the catalyst surface again from the reveres water gas shift reaction is converted to CO. Boudouard reactions as adverse reactions of coke, produced a non-activated catalyst. In this mechanism the formaldehyde and methyl formate are the key intermediates formed in the reaction on copper catalysts."
11,Conclusions,"The effect of ultrasonic power on physicochemical and catalytic properties of nanocatalysts fabricated by the ultrasound assisted coprecipitation synthesis method were studied. XRD results proved the effect of enhancement of ultrasonic power on decrease of copper and zinc oxides crystallinity. Also, BET analysis confirmed the surface area enhancement. The FESEM images described that the nanocatalysts had nanometer particles which became smaller by increasing the ultrasound power. Enhancement of sonication power increased the rate of production of cavitation sites and more particle nucleation production occurred. CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 nanocatalyst synthesized at power of 90W, due to mentioned favorable structural properties is more active and produced higher percentage of hydrogen than the same nanocatalyst synthesized in the lower power."
