0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the development of smart packaging films based on natural pigments (e.g., chlorophyll, carotenoids, curcumin, betalains, and anthocyanins) has received increasing attention in food packaging field (Alizadeh-Sani, Mohammadian, Rhim, & Jafari, 2020; Bhargava, Sharanagat, Mor, & Kumar, 2020; Halonen et al., 2020). Among different natural pigments, anthocyanins have been most widely used in smart packaging films (Roy & Rhim, 2020). Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds that present purple, blue and red colors in vegetables and fruits (Cortez, Luna-Vital, Margulis, & de Mejia, 2017). Notably, anthocyanins are pH-sensitive substances that can change their molecular structures and colors with pH variation. The pH-sensitivity of anthocyanins makes it possible to real-time monitor food quality. Meanwhile, anthocyanins are active components with antioxidant and antimicrobial abilities, which are benefit to prolong food shelf-life (Roy & Rhim, 2020; Yong & Liu, 2020). In spite of numerous advantages of anthocyanins-based smart packaging films, their applications are hindered by the low stability of anthocyanins. In general, anthocyanins are easily degraded when they are exposed to harsh conditions, such as light, temperature, oxygen and enzymes (Tarone, Cazarin, & Junior, 2020). Therefore, it is essential to increase the stability of anthocyanins in order to extend the applications of anthocyanins-based films in smart packaging. In recent years, several micro-/nano-encapsulation techniques including emulsions, liposomes, complexes, coacervation, molecular inclusion, freeze-drying, spray-drying, and electro-spraying have been demonstrated as effective ways to elevate the stability of anthocyanins (Sharif, Khoshnoudi-Nia, & Jafari, 2020; Tarone et al., 2020). Encapsulation can not only protect anthocyanins from external harsh conditions but also provide a sustained release of anthocyanins under specific conditions (Sharif et al., 2020). Among different encapsulation techniques, nanocomplexes are especially useful to stabilize anthocyanins by entrapping them in nano-sized complexes (Wang et al., 2019). Nanocomplexes are normally formed from two oppositely charged biopolymers (e.g., proteins and polysaccharides as well as their derivatives) via electrostatic interactions (Tarone et al., 2020). The charge density, the molecular weight and the ratio of biopolymers along with the environmental conditions (e.g., ionic strength, pH, temperature, and pressure) are key factors affecting the formation of nanocomplexes (Ghasemi, Jafari, Assadpour, & Khomeiri, 2017). Till now, only few studies have focused on improving the stability of anthocyanins-based packaging films by using encapsulation techniques, such as molecular inclusion, freeze-drying, and spray-drying (Nogueira, Fakhouri, & de Oliveira, 2019; Nogueira, Fakhouri, Velasco, & de Oliveira, 2019; Stoll, Costa, Jablonski, Flôres, & de Oliveira Rios, 2016). Moreover, the development of smart packaging films by using anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes has been rarely investigated (Wang et al., 2019). Recently, Wang et al. (2019) prepared antioxidant packaging films based on gelatin and cranberry anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes and found the obtained films could be used to protect olive oil from oxidation. However, the impact of encapsulation on the stability and pH-sensitivity of the films with anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes is still unclear. Lycium ruthenicum is a nutraceutical food with a high content of anthocyanins (Wang et al., 2018). Previous studies have shown L. ruthenicum anthocyanins can be directly integrated with different biopolymers (e.g., κ-carrageenan and starch) to prepare smart packaging films (Liu et al., 2019; Qin et al., 2019). In this study, L. ruthenicum anthocyanins were encapsulated in chitosan hydrochloride (CHC)/carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) nanocomplexes. The positively charged CHC and the negatively charged CMC are two different water soluble chitosan derivatives. It has been demonstrated that the positively charged ‒NH3+ on CHC can establish electrostatic interactions with negatively charged COO− on CMC with the formation of CHC/CMC nanocomplexes (Ge, Yue, Chi, Liang, & Gao, 2018). Moreover, CHC/CMC nanocomplexes create a hydrophobic core that can prevent the hydration of anthocyanins and maintain the stability of anthocyanins (He et al., 2017). The obtained anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes were mixed with starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix to develop smart packaging film. The functionality and stability of the film containing anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes were compared with those of the film containing free (un-encapsulated) anthocyanins. Finally, the developed films were applied to package and indicate the freshness of refrigerated largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) fillets."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Lycium ruthenicum anthocyanins mainly composed of pelargonidin-3-O-acetylglucoside (10.50%) and dimmermalvidin-3-O-glucoside- petunidin-3-O-glucoside (80.11%) were obtained from a previous study (Qin et al., 2019). Chitosan hydrochloride (CHC, deacetylation degree of 85%), O-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC, O-substitution degree of 90%), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, polymerization degree of 1750 ± 50) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were obtained from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Cassava starch was provided by Ganzhiyuan Sugar Industry Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China). Fresh largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) was acquired in the local market (Yangzhou, China)."
3,Preparation and characterization of anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes,"2.2 Preparation and characterization of anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes To prepare L. ruthenicum anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes, 3 mL of anthocyanins solution (2 mg/mL) was mixed with 7.5 mL of CMC solution (pH 6.0, 5.75 mg/mL). Then, 15 mL of CHC solution (pH 4.9, 2 mg/mL) was added dropwise to anthocyanins/CMC mixture and further stirred at 20 °C for 30 min (He et al., 2017). The final pH value of the nanocomplex suspension was 5.62. The blank nanocomplexes without anthocyanins were prepared and used as the control. The average particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index (PDI) of nanocomplexes were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique via Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). Average particle size was recorded as the hydrodynamic diameter of sample. Zeta potential was determined from the electrophoretic mobility of sample. PDI was measured by monitoring the size distribution and dispersion homogeneity of sample. The morphology of nanocomplexes was recorded by Tecnai 12 TEM (Philips, Amsterdam, NL). The encapsulation efficiency of anthocyanins in nanocomplexes was measured by the method of He et al. (2017)."
4,Development of the films,"2.3 Development of the films The films were prepared by solvent casting method (Wang et al., 2019). Firstly, 6.8 g cassava starch and PVA with a weight ratio of 1: 1 were dissolved in 200 mL of distilled water with continuous stirring at 100 °C for 90 min. After the solution was cooled to 40 °C, 289 mL of anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes solution (containing 68 mg anthocyanins) and 30 wt% glycerol on starch basis were added into starch/PVA solution. The solution was thoroughly mixed at 40 °C for 90 min. Finally, the film was formed by solvent casting in a self-designed Plexiglas mold (24 cm × 24 cm) at 30 °C for 48 h. The obtained starch/PVA film containing anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes was termed as SP-AN film. Meanwhile, starch/PVA films with and without free anthocyanins (containing 68 mg un-encapsulated anthocyanins) were prepared and termed as SP-FA film and SP film, respectively. All films were balanced at 20 °C and 50% relative humidity for 48 h before testing."
5,Structural characterization of the films,"2.4 Structural characterization of the films 2.4.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The cross-section of the films was observed by Gemini SEM 300 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Prior to observation, film sample was immersed in liquid nitrogen, manually cryo-fractured, fixed on aluminum stub using double-sided tape, and finally sputter-coated with thin-layer of gold. 2.4.2 Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy The FT-IR spectra of the films were recorded by Varian 670 FT-IR spectrometer in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. For each film sample analysis, 32 scans were recorded at the frequency range of 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1. 2.4.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The crystallinity of the films was determined by AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) with Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The XRD pattern was collected at 2θ range of 5–80°."
6,Determination of the physical properties of the films,"2.5 Determination of the physical properties of the films 2.5.1 Color and light transmittance The color of the films (expressed as L, a, b and ΔE values) was determined by a SC-80C colorimeter (Kangguang Instrument Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) with a white standard color plate to calibrate the instrument (Qin et al., 2019). The light transmittance through the films the films was determined by Lambda 35 UV–vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Inc., MA, USA) at 200–800 nm. 2.5.2 Thickness The thickness of the films, taken at ten random locations, was measured by Mitutoyo No. 293–766 digital micrometer (Tester Sangyo Co., Ltd., Japan). 2.5.3 Moisture content and water vapor permeability (WVP) The moisture content of the films was determined by drying film sample at 105 °C to a constant weight (Yong et al., 2019). The WVP of the films was determined by gravimetric method according to ASTM method E96-05 (ASTM, 2005). Briefly, film sample (6 × 6 cm) was sealed on top of a centrifuge tube with an internal diameter of 4 cm and a depth of 8 cm filled with thoroughly dried silica gels. Then, the centrifuge tube was placed in a desiccator at 20 °C containing distilled water. The centrifuge tube was weighed every 12 h for 3 consecutive days. 2.5.4 Mechanical property The mechanical property of the films was determined by TMS-Pro texture analyzer (Food Technology Co., VA, USA) according to ASTM method D882-09 (ASTM, 2009). Briefly, film sample (6 × 1 cm) was fixed between two grips of the texture analyzer with initial separation of 4 cm. The cross-head speed of the texture analyzer was set at 1 mm/s."
7,Determination of the antioxidant activity of the films,"2.6 Determination of the antioxidant activity of the films The antioxidant activity of the films was determined by DPPH radical scavenging test (Yong et al., 2019). Briefly, film samples were immersed in 4 mL of 100 μM DPPH methanol solution with film equivalents of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 mg/mL. The reaction was conducted in the dark for 1 h at 20 °C and the absorbance of reaction solution was determined at 517 nm."
8,Determination of the pH-sensitivity of the films,"2.7 Determination of the pH-sensitivity of the films The pH-sensitivity of the films was determined by immersing film sample to different buffer solutions (pH 3–12) for 1 min, and the color changes of the film sample were recorded."
9,Determination of the stability of the films,"2.8 Determination of the stability of the films To determine the stability of SP-FA and SP-AN films, the films were placed at 35 °C and exposed to light radiation (Philips TL5 28W/865 lamp) for 30 days. The antioxidant activity and pH-sensitivity of the 30-day treated films were further evaluated."
10,Application of the films,"2.9 Application of the films The effect of film package on the quality of refrigerated largemouth bass fillets was determined. First, live largemouth bass acquired from the local market was slaughtered in the laboratory and cut into small fillets after removing its innards, head, tail and fins. Then, the obtained bass fillets were immediately transferred into four plastic boxes (containing 50 g bass fillets each box). The plastic boxes were individually sealed with commercial polyethylene (PE) film, SP film, SP-FA film, and SP-AN film. The thickness and WVP of PE film were 0.020 mm and 1.2 × 10−12 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1, respectively, as provided by the manufacturer (Jieda Chemical Plastic Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China). The bass fillets were stored at 4 °C for 10 days. The weight loss, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and total viable count (TVC) of bass fillets were tested according to the method of Kaewprachu, Osako, Benjakul, Suthiluk, and Rawdkuen (2017) every 2 days. Meanwhile, the color changes of SP-FA and SP-AN films were recorded every 2 days."
11,Statistical analysis,2.10 Statistical analysis Duncan test and one-way analysis of variance were used for multiple comparisons by SPSS 13.0 software package. Difference was considered to be statistically significant if p < 0.05.
12,Results and discussion,
13,Characterization of the nanocomplexes,"3.1 Characterization of the nanocomplexes In this study, nanocomplexes were prepared based on electrostatic interactions between positively charged CHC and negatively charged CMC. Till now, CHC/CMC nanocomplexes have been used in the encapsulation of anthocyanins from different sources, such as blueberry (Ge et al., 2018; He et al., 2017) and cranberry (Wang et al., 2019). He et al. (2017) revealed the ratio of CHC, CMC and anthocyanins was the key factor affecting the formation of nanocomplexes. They found the formulation of 29.4 mg CHC, 42.9 mg CMC, and 5.97 mg blueberry anthocyanins produced ideal nanocomplexes (He et al., 2017). In the present study, the similar formulation was used to prepare L. ruthenicum anthocyanins-loaded CHC/CMC nanocomplexes. CHC/CMC nanocomplexes with and without anthocyanins were compared in terms of average particle size, zeta potential, and PDI. As shown in Table 1 , the average particle size of anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes (242.1 nm) was a little higher than blank nanocomplexes (233.5 nm), indicating that the addition of anthocyanins slightly increased the dimension of nanocomplexes. The enhanced dimension of anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes was also confirmed by TEM image (Fig. 1 ), where the core-shell structure was clearly observed in the nanocomplexes containing anthocyanins. The similar phenomenon was documented by Ge et al. (2018) in blueberry anthocyanins-loaded CHC/CMC nanocomplexes. The stability of the nanocomplexes was reflected by their zeta potential. Zeta potential is a parameter reflecting the repulsion strength between nanocomplexes (Weiner, Tscharnuter, & Fairhurst, 1993). The addition of L. ruthenicum anthocyanins made the zeta potential of nanocomplexes increased from +24.33 mV to +28.13 mV, which was attributed to the cationic character of anthocyanins. Ge et al. (2018) suggested that CHC/CMC nanocomplexes with higher zeta potential were more stable. Therefore, L. ruthenicum anthocyanins-loaded CHC/CMC nanocomplexes were more stable than blank nanocomplexes. PDI value (0–1) reflects the size distribution of nanocomplexes. A small PDI value indicates a homogenous size distribution of nanocomplexes, whereas a large PDI value shows a heterogeneous size distribution of nanocomplexes. The PDI of nanocomplexes decreased from 0.237 to 0.186 after the incorporation of anthocyanins, indicating anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes had more homogenous size distribution than blank nanocomplexes. The encapsulation efficiency of L. ruthenicum anthocyanins in the nanocomplexes was 68.4%. He et al. (2017) demonstrated the average particle size and encapsulation efficiency of blueberry anthocyanins-loaded CHC/CMC nanocomplexes were 219.53 nm and 63.15%, respectively, when CMC/CHC ratio was fixed at 1.46. Ge et al. (2018) found the average particle size, zeta potential, PDI and encapsulation efficiency of blueberry-loaded CHC/CMC nanocomplexes were 178.1 nm, +25.6 mV, 0.315, and 44%, respectively, when CHC/CMC ratio reached 1.2. Above results suggested the character of anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes was influenced by the ratio of CHC and CMC as well as the source of anthocyanins."
14,Structural characterization of the films,"3.2 Structural characterization of the films Free anthocyanins and anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes were individually added into starch/PVA matrix to prepare smart packaging films. As presented in Fig. 2 , the microstructure of SP film was changed by adding free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes. The blank SP film exhibited a two-phase microstructure because starch and PVA were incompatible and had different densities (Qin, Liu, Zhang, & Liu, 2020). Meanwhile, starch/PVA blend tended to phase-separate because of the small contribution to mixing entropy in these two kinds of unlike polymers (De Gennes & Gennes, 1979; Flory, 1953). Free anthocyanins only slightly elevated the compatibility of starch/PVA blend. By contrast, anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes made the cross-section of film become uniform without phase separation. It has been demonstrated that the miscibility of unlike polymers can be enhanced by adding polyelectrolyte because of the contribution to mixing entropy by the counterions (Khokhlov & Nyrkova, 1992). Since CHC/CMC-nanocomplexes are basically polyelectrolyte complexes, they might act as the compatibilizer for the non-ionic polymers (starch and PVA). Thus, the anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes were evenly distributed in the film and significantly promoted the compatibility of starch/PVA blend. However, Wang et al. (2019) observed the homogeneous surface of gelatin film became heterogeneous after adding free cranberry anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded CHC/CMC nanocomplexes. Different from starch/PVA blend, gelatin is a single polymer and a polyelectrolyte by itself. In this respect, no phase separation took place when gelatin was used as the film matrix. However, the addition of anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes (polyelectrolyte complexes) could hamper the formation of a homogeneous structure. Above results suggested the microstructure of the films containing anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes was influenced by the nature of film matrix. FT-IR spectrometer can be not only used to determine the functional groups of film components but also applied to evaluate the intermolecular interactions between film components (Yong & Liu, 2020). As shown in Fig. 3 , blank SP film presented the vibration of starch (O–H stretching vibration at 3279 cm−1, C–H stretching vibration at 2927 cm−1 and glucose pyranose ring vibration at 993−1079 cm−1) and the vibration of PVA (basic skeleton vibration at 1079 and 1413 cm−1) (Pereira, de Arruda, & Stefani, 2015). Obvious position shifts were observed for O–H and C–H stretching vibration after free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes were added into the film. The O–H stretching vibration shifted from 3279 cm−1 to 3290–3291 cm−1 while the C–H stretching vibration shifted from 2927 cm−1 to 2923–2924 cm−1. Meanwhile, the O–H stretching vibration intensified after free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes were added into the film (Fig. S1). This was because free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes formed hydrogen bonds with starch/PVA matrix. As compared with blank SP and SP-FA films, SP-AN film exhibited stronger vibration at 1015 and 3291 cm−1 (Fig. S1), indicating anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes had stronger intermolecular interactions with film matrix. This result was consistent with SEM observation that anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes greatly improved the compatibility between starch and PVA (Fig. 2). Till now, the formation of intermolecular interactions between starch/PVA matrix and free anthocyanins from different sources has demonstrated by many researchers (Zhai et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhang, Huang, Yan, Hu, & Ren, 2020). Recently, Wang et al. (2019) also verified the interactions between gelatin matrix and anthocyanins-loaded CHC/CMC nanocomplexes by using Raman spectral analysis. In this study, our results further suggested anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes produced stronger interactions with starch/PVA matrix than free anthocyanins. As shown in Fig. 4 , blank SP film exhibited a single diffraction peak at 20°, which corresponded to PVA molecules (Deghiedy & El-Sayed, 2020). Free anthocyanins and anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes had different impacts on the crystalline character of the film. Free anthocyanins slightly reduced the crystalline degree of the film, which was because the intermolecular interactions between anthocyanins and starch/PVA matrix affected the crystallinity of PVA. Zhai et al. (2017) also found the crystalline degree of SP film decreased after adding free roselle anthocyanins. Since anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes had stronger interactions with film matrix as compared with free anthocyanins (Fig. 3), SP-AN film exhibited lower crystalline degree than SP-FA film. In addition, SP-AN film showed a new diffraction peak at 17.8°, corresponding to CHC in the wall of nanocomplexes (Liang et al., 2017). Based on SEM, FT-IR and XRD analyses, it could be concluded that anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes had stronger interactions with starch/PVA matrix and were more benefit to improve the homogeneity of the films."
15,Physical properties of the films,"3.3 Physical properties of the films As smart packaging films, anthocyanins-rich films can reflect the freshness of foods by the film color. Therefore, the color of anthocyanins-rich films is an important factor affecting the application of the films (Prietto et al., 2017). As presented in Fig. 5 A, blank SP, SP-FA and SP-AN films were visually transparent. Different from colorless SP film, SP-FA and SP-AN films were bright purple and dark purple, respectively. Other researchers also documented SP films became colorful after anthocyanins were incorporated (Zhai et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020). In this study, SP-AN film was dark than SP-FA film because anthocyanins were encapsulated in CHC/CMC nanocomplexes. As a result, the innate color of anthocyanins was partially masked by the nanocomplexes. Effects of free anthocyanins and anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes on the color values of the films were summarized in Table 2 . After free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes were incorporated, the lightness (L value) and yellowness (b value) of the films decreased whereas the redness (a value) and total color difference (ΔE) of the films increased. A similar trend was reported by Wang et al. (2019) in gelatin-based films containing free cranberry anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes. The light transmittance reflects the light blocking ability of the films. As shown in Fig. 5B, blank SP film exhibited a high light transmittance. However, the addition of free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes significantly decreased the light transmittance of the films. SP-FA and SP-AN films had nearly zero transmittance at the UV light range of 200–320 nm, indicating that these two films had potent UV light blocking ability. This strong UV light blocking ability of SP-FA and SP-AN films was attributed to the presence of chromophores (e.g., CC and CO) in anthocyanins. Many researchers also found the films containing free anthocyanins had strong UV light blocking ability (Ge et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). In the visible light range, SP-FA film had lower light transmittance than SP-AN film; which was because anthocyanins were encapsulated in CHC/CMC nanocomplexes and their light blocking ability was masked by the nanocomplexes. In addition, anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes might act as the compatibilizer for starch and PVA, thereby reducing the phase-separation and crystallization of the films (as shown in Figs. 2 and 4). Wang et al. (2019) also observed gelatin-based film containing cranberry anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes had lower light blocking ability than the film containing free anthocyanins. Thickness is an important factor affecting the WVP and mechanical properties of food packaging films. As presented in Table 3 , the thickness of SP, SP-FA and SP-AN films was in the range of 0.086–0.087 mm. However, no significant difference was observed for the thickness of different films (p > 0.05). This indicated that the incorporation of free or nano-encapsulated anthocyanins did not significantly change film thickness. Wang et al. (2019) also reported the thickness of gelatin-based film was not altered by incorporating free cranberry anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes. The moisture content of SP, SP-FA and SP-AN films is summarized in Table 3. SP film exhibited the highest water content due to strong interactions between water molecules and hydrophilic hydroxyl groups in starch/PVA blend (Zhai et al., 2017). The moisture content of the film decreased significantly after the addition of free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes, which was because the free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes formed strong interactions with starch/PVA blend. As a result, the available number of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups in the film matrix was greatly reduced and the films showed decreased moisture content (Huang, Chen, Zhou, Li, & Hu, 2020). In addition, some water molecules in the films were replaced by free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes or anthocyanins molecules (Alizadeh-Sani, Tavassoli, McClements, & Hamishehkar, 2020). Notably, SP-AN film showed lower moisture content as compared to SP-FA film. It was probably because anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes had stronger interactions with starch/PVA blend, which was more benefit to reduce the hydrophilicity of the films. Wang et al. (2019) also observed gelatin-based film containing cranberry anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes had lower moisture content than the film containing free anthocyanins. WVP represents the moisture blocking ability of the films. As shown in Table 3, the incorporation of free anthocyanins or anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes decreased the WVP of the films. This was consistent with the results of other researchers who found free anthocyanins could enhance the moisture blocking ability of the films (Qin et al., 2019; Yong et al., 2019). Anthocyanins could form stable hydrogen bonds with the hydrophilic groups in starch/PVA blend, and thus the hydrophilicity of the film was reduced. Notably, SP-AN film exhibited a much lower WVP than SP-FA film. This was because anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes were evenly dispersed in the matrix and act as the compatibilizer for starch and PVA (as shown in Fig. 2). As a result, the interfacial zones of starch and PVA disappeared in SP-AN film, making SP-AN film become more compact than SP and SP-FA films. Therefore, it was more difficult for moisture to permeate through SP-AN film. As presented in Table 3, the tensile strength (TS) of the film was not influenced by free anthocyanins but was slightly elevated by anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes. On the other hand, the elongation at break (EB) of the film was slightly increased by free anthocyanins and was remarkably elevated by anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes. Above results indicated anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes significantly increased the flexibility of the film, which was mainly because the nanocomplexes had strong interfacial interactions with film matrix (as shown in Fig. 3). Besides, anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes improved the compatibility of starch/PVA blend (as shown in Fig. 2), making starch and PVA chains well interact with each other. Thus, SP-AN film showed higher EB than SP and SP-FA films. Recently, Wang et al. (2019) found free cranberry anthocyanins and anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes significantly improved the TS and EB of gelatin-based film. However, they did not observe significant differences in the mechanical properties between the film containing free anthocyanins and the film containing anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes (Wang et al., 2019), which was mainly because the nature of gelatin was different from starch/PVA blend (as explained in section 3.2). Therefore, the mechanical property of the film might be influenced by the source of anthocyanins and the nature of film matrix."
16,Functional properties and stability of the films,"3.4 Functional properties and stability of the films Antioxidant activity is important for active packaging films. The antioxidant activity of the films, determined by DPPH scavenging test, was shown in Fig. 6 . Free anthocyanins and anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes remarkably elevated the antioxidant activity of the films. This was mainly because anthocyanins could eliminate free radicals through forming phenoxy groups (Zhang et al., 2019). Many researchers documented that free anthocyanins could endow excellent antioxidant activity to the films (Ge et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yong et al., 2019). Notably, SP-FA film showed stronger antioxidant activity than SP-AN film, which was because the antioxidant activity of anthocyanins was masked by CHC/CMC nanocomplexes. Meanwhile, the encapsulated anthocyanins were slowly released from the film into external environment (Yan et al., 2018). Nonetheless, the controlled release of anthocyanins inhibited fast depletion of antioxidant capacity of the film, and thus SP-AN film could exhibit a long-term antioxidant capacity in practical application. Nogueira, Fakhouri, Velasco, and de Oliveira (2019) also found arrowroot starch-based film with un-encapsulated blackberry pulp powder showed higher antioxidant activity than the film with encapsulated blackberry pulp powder. The spoilage of protein-rich food normally generate a huge amount of volatile nitrogen compounds, resulting in an alkaline micro-environment in the package. Thus, the pH-sensitivity of the films under alkaline conditions is a key property for smart packaging films. As shown in Fig. 7 A, SP-FA and SP-AN films both significant color changes under alkaline conditions (pH > 7). The color changes of the films were resulted from the structure transformation of anthocyanins, which was demonstrated by other researchers (Mei et al., 2020; Prietto et al., 2017; Yong & Liu, 2020). However, the color changes of SP-AN film were somewhat different from those of SP-FA film. This was because anthocyanins encapsulated in CHC/CMC nanocomplexes were difficult to contact and react with buffers. To evaluate the impact of nano-encapsulation on the stability of the films, SP-FA and SP-AN films were subjected to heat (35 °C) and light radiation treatments for 30 days. Since free anthocyanins were sensitive to heat and light radiation, SP-FA film faded and turned caffeic color after 30 days (Fig. 7B). By contrast, SP-AN film almost maintained its original purple color after 30 days, indicating CHC/CMC nanocomplexes had protective effects on anthocyanins against heat and light treatments. The antioxidant activity and pH-sensitivity of the treated films were also evaluated. After 30-day heat and light treatments, the DPPH scavenging activity of SP-FA and SP-AN film was reduced by 48.69% and 17.45%, respectively. Meanwhile, the pH-sensitivity of SP-FA film significantly weakened, whereas the pH-sensitivity of SP-AN film was not remarkably changed by heat and light treatments (Fig. 7B). All above results suggested SP-AN film was more stable than SP-FA film under heat and light treatments. Wang et al. (2019) also found gelatin-based film containing cranberry anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes had higher stability than the film containing free anthocyanins."
17,Application of the films,"3.5 Application of the films Since SP-FA and SP-AN films possessed strong antioxidant activity and were sensitive to alkaline conditions (Figs. 6 and 7), these films were further used to package and indicate freshness of largemouth bass fillets at 4 °C for 10 days. As presented in Fig. 8 A, the weight loss of bass fillets in all treatment groups increased with prolonging storage time. PE film, due to its hydrophobic property and strong moisture blocking ability, effectively prevented the transmission of moisture generated from the evaporation of bass fillets. However, bass fillets packaged by blank SP film showed the highest weight loss, which was because SP film had the highest WVP (Table 3). By contrast, bass fillets packaged by SP-FA and SP-AN films exhibited moderate weight loss. SP-AN film, due to its relatively lower WVP, was more effective in preventing the weight loss of bass fillets as compared to SP-FA film. TVB-N, mainly composed of nitrogen-containing compounds, reflects the sensory rejection and off-flavor of spoiled fish (Moradi, Tajik, Almasi, Forough, & Ezati, 2019). TVB-N is normally used to indicate the spoilage degree of fish and its value increase is related to the function of spoilage microorganisms and endogenous enzymes (Ju et al., 2018). As presented in Fig. 8B, the TVB-N value of bass fillets in all treatment groups increased with the extension of storage time. Bass fillets packaged by PE film showed the highest TVB-N. By contrast, bass fillets packaged by SP-FA and SP-AN films had the lowest TVB-N. The TVB-N limitation value for edible fish is 20 mg/100g based on Chinese standard GB 2733-2015. In this respect, the TVB-N of bass fillets packaged by PE and SP films exceeded the limitation at the 5th day. The TVB-N of bass fillets packaged by SP-FA and SP-AN films exceeded the limitation at the 8th day. The better preservation effect of SP-FA and SP-AN films was mainly because anthocyanins in the films could effectively inhibit the growth of spoilage microorganisms (Yong & Liu, 2020). The auto-oxidization of lipids inevitably occurs during fish storage. TBARS value is often used to reflect the auto-oxidization degree of fish (Wang et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. 8C, the TBARS value of bass fillets in all treatment groups gradually increased during whole storage period. When the storage time exceeded 4 days, the TBARS value of bass fillets in different treatment groups decreased in the order of PE film > SP film > SP-AN film > SP-FA film, which was consistent with the order of antioxidant activity of the films (Fig. 6). Ruan et al. (2019) found consumers felt unpleasant odors when the TBARS value of fish exceeded 0.6 mg MDA/kg. In this respect, the TBARS value of bass fillets packaged by PE, SP, SP-AN and SP-FA films exceeded the limitation at the 4th, 6th, 9th and 10th day, respectively. Our results suggested that un-encapsulated and encapsulated anthocyanins in the films could effectively retard the auto-oxidization of lipids during the storage of bass fillets. TVC is frequently used to indicate microbial growth status during fish storage (Jamróz, Kulawik, Guzik, & Duda, 2019). As shown in Fig. 8D, the initial TVC value of bass fillets was 3.69 lg CFU/g, which was consistent with the result of Ju et al. (2018). The TVC of bass fillets packaged by PE and SP films increased rapidly and exceeded the limitation of 6 lg CFU/g for aquatic product (Kulawik et al., 2016) at the 5th and 6th day, respectively. In contrast, the TVC of bass fillets packaged by SP-FA and SP-AN films exceeded the limitation of 6 lg CFU/g at the 8th day. However, when the storage time of bass fillets was lower than 8 days, no significant differences were observed between SP-FA film and SP-AN film treatment groups. The better preservation effect of SP-FA and SP-AN films could be explained by the antimicrobial activity of anthocyanins (Yong & Liu, 2020). Therefore, it could be concluded that SP-FA and SP-AN films effectively prolonged the shelf life of bass fillets to 7 days during storage at 4 °C. The application of anthocyanins-based colorimetric films in indicating fish freshness was reported by many researchers (Moradi et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2017). In this study, the color changes of SP-FA and SP-AN films during refrigerated storage of bass fillets were recorded. As presented in Table 4 , distinct color variations were noted for SP-FA and SP-AN films with the extension of storage time. The color changes of SP-FA and SP-AN films were caused by the production of TVB-N from fish spoilage. Based on the result of TVB-N test (Fig. 8B), bass fillets packaged by SP-FA and SP-AN films exceeded the limitation value (20 mg/100g) at the 8th day. Notably, SP-FA film changed from initial bright purple to dark purple at day 6 and to atrovirens at day 8, while SP-AN film changed from initial dark purple to dark blue at day 6 and to aqua at day 8. Along with the color changes of SP-FA and SP-AN films, the ΔE value of these two films gradually decreased in the first 6 days and increased afterwards. Huang et al. (2019) suggested the color change of the films was detectable by naked eyes when the ΔE diversity of two films was larger than 5. In this respect, the ΔE value diversity of SP-FA and SP-AN films changing from day 6 to day 8 was 8.08 and 5.20, respectively. This indicated the color changes of SP-FA and SP-AN films were detected by naked eyes when bass fillets spoiled."
18,Conclusions,"Free anthocyanins and anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes were individually used to develop smart packaging films in this study. By contrast, anthocyanins-loaded nanocomplexes effective promoted the miscibility of SP film matrix. The resultant SP-AN film presented higher moisture blocking and mechanical properties than SP-FA film. However, SP-FA film showed higher light blocking and antioxidant properties than SP-AN film. Although SP-FA and SP-AN films were both pH-sensitive, SP-AN film was more stable than SP-FA film. SP-FA and SP-AN films could effectively prolong the shelf life and indicate the freshness of largemouth bass fillets. Considering SP-AN film had relatively higher stability, the film was more suitable to be used in smart packaging."
