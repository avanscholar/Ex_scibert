0,Introduction,"In an effort to reduce society’s dependency on oil as a feedstock, conversion of biomass into chemicals and fuels continues to be a promising route towards feedstock sustainability [1]. Different challenges emerge in biomass refining compared to petroleum refining due to the over-functionalized and highly oxygenated compounds derived from common forms of biomass such as lignocellulose [2,3]. Furfural, which can be produced through the dehydration of xylose or via fast pyrolysis of biomass, is a lignocellulose derivative that can be converted into a wide variety of chemicals and fuels [4,5]. Some of the important chemicals include furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, furan, and 1,5-pentanediol (Scheme 1 ). Typically, furfural conversion utilizes heterogeneous catalysts due to the higher stabilities and ease of separation of these materials compared to homogeneous catalysts [6]. Industrially, chromium based catalysts have been heavily used for conversion of furfural to various chemicals. However, due to the environmentally hazardous nature of many oxidized chromium species, other metals may be preferred [7–11]. To date, many studies utilizing catalysts derived from a single metal species supported on a relatively inert material such as silica have been reported for furfural reduction. Specific examples include reports utilizing a variety of different transition metals, including Pt, Pd, Ir, Ni, and Cu [12–20]. Unfortunately, many monometallic catalysts suffer from lack of selectivity and therefore, the addition of a secondary metal has been used to greatly improve the properties of the first metal. One particularly successful approach has been to combine a reducible metal with a more oxophilic metal to create catalytic domains that offer the potential for multi-point interactions with the oxygenated furfural molecule [21–25]. The degree of reduction of the metal(s) plays a key role in creating a bifunctional catalyst surface with the reducible and oxophilic metal pair [2]. Among the array of bimetallic/bifunctional catalysts used for furfural hydrogenation, Ir-ReOx catalysts have demonstrated high selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol, with some authors proposing that the ReOx orients furfural on the surface, while Ir subsequently hydrogenates the aldehyde [26,27]. Since typically these bifunctional catalysts contain precious metals that may not be economically attractive for large scale use, we sought to utilize non-precious metals to create mixed metal-oxide domains similar to those mentioned above. More specifically, Ni has previously been shown to be a good hydrogenation catalyst for furfural [14]. To this end, Ni was chosen as the reducible metal, and other oxophilic metals were included into the support matrix. Most studies conducted with two metal systems for furfural conversion containing Ni have focused on bimetallics or alloyed catalysts including NiFe, NiPd, and NiSn systems [12,28,29]. Two recent reports have shown the promise of Ni bifunctional catalysts by demonstrating that both Ni phyllosilicates and Ni-Al mixed metal oxides conduct CO hydrogenolysis of HMF due to acid sites adjacent to Ni nanoparticles [24,25]. In this work, nickel-containing layered double hydroxides (LDH) derived from hydrotalcites have been used to create highly dispersed, porous, and thermally stable mixed metal oxides. LDH derived mixed metal oxides provide useful characteristics in the field of catalysis due to their wide versatility [30–33]. LDH materials derived from hydrotalcite structures have a balance of M3+ and M2+ cations, which allows for a variety of metals to be incorporated into the structure while maintaining high metal dispersity, high thermal stability, and sufficient porosity. Few studies have been conducted to investigate furanic compound hydrogenation utilizing LDH derived catalysts, and no in-depth spectroscopy has been reported [23,25,34]. In this study, two other metals, Co and Mg, were mixed with Ni and Al through a co-precipitation method. Two recent studies reporting catalysts with Co in the metallic phase have shown that the catalysts are effective in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol in liquid phase batch reactions [35,36]. Thermodynamically, Co and Mg oxides have vastly different reduction energies, with Co oxide being more reducible than Mg, which causes varying interactions with Ni during the reduction phase of catalyst synthesis. In this work, an in-depth investigation was conducted on the metallic and oxide species present after reduction, which gives insight into the catalytic behavior of the materials in the gas phase hydrogenation of furfural."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Furfural (99% purity, ACS Grade) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and stored in inert N2 atmosphere to limit its polymerization. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99% purity), Na2CO3 (99.5% purity), and ethylene glycol diethyl ether (98% purity) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O were purchased from Alfa Aesar (98–102% purity). NaOH (97% purity) was purchased from EMD. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis Ni-M-Al (M-Co, Mg) mixed metal oxides with varying Ni:M ratios of 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, while trying to maintain (Ni+M)/Al=0.25, were prepared in the following manner. Solution A contained 0.6M of the metal nitrates corresponding to the molar ratio of metal cations. Solution B contained 1M solution of NaOH, and solution C contained 0.3M solution of Na2CO3. Using a peristaltic pump Solution A and Solution B were added dropwise into Solution C, contained in a flat-bottom flask, at approximately 5mL/min under vigorous stirring and room temperature. A pH meter was placed in the solution, and a Labview program maintained the pH at approximately 10 by adjusting the flow of Solution B. Once Solution A had been fully added, the mixture was heated to 60°C, and it was aged under vigorous stirring for 48h. After, the precipitant was filtered and washed with distilled water until the wash solution was at about pH of 7. The recovered solid was dried in an oven at 100°C overnight, and then it was calcined at 400°C with 50mL/min flow of air with a ramp rate of 10°C/min and a hold time of 4h."
4,Characterization techniques,"2.3 Characterization techniques Nitrogen physisorption was performed in a Micromeritics Tristar II at −196°C after the samples were pretreated at 200°C (150°C for uncalcined LDH materials) under vacuum for 12h. Chemisorption experiments including temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and pulse CO chemisorption were conducted on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. For each TPR experiment, approximately 50mg of sample was placed on top of a small bed of quartz wool in a quartz U-tube. In regards to the TPR experiment, the mixed metal oxide was pretreated in 20mL/min of He (Airgas, UHP) at 200°C for 2h to remove preadsorbed species. The sample was then cooled to 50°C and the gas was switched to 20mL/min of 10% H2/He. The furnace was heated to 800°C at 5°C/min while under the flow of 10% H2/He. The outlet gas passed through a liquid acetone/nitrogen trap, and then passed through a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD). Pulse CO experiments were conducted in a similar fashion with a few minor changes. Approximately 20mg catalyst sample was diluted with 80mg of SiC, and placed in the quartz tube held in place by quartz wool. During the reduction step the sample was heated to 500°C at 5°C/min and held for 1h. The sample was then cooled to 400°C where He began to flow for 30min to remove all adsorbed species. Afterwards the sample was cooled to 30°C to begin pulse CO testing. Doses of 10% CO/He (Airgas) were passed over the sample and analyzed in the TCD. Once saturation was reached, He was flowed over the sample for 60min to remove physisorbed species. Finally a second round of pulses was conducted to verify if there were any physisorbed species adsorbed, which was taken into consideration when calculating the active metallic surface area. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected using a Philips X-pert diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted using a Thermo K-Alpha spectrometer employing monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The pressure inside the analytical chamber was approximately 5×10−8 Torr. The binding energies (BE) of all elements were tuned to the Ag 3d peak (368.2eV) with an uncertainty of ±0.2eV. Samples for scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging were prepared by dropping a methanol-catalyst mixture on a lacy carbon-coated Cu grid and allowing the methanol to evaporate. Images were collected on an aberration-corrected-Nion UltraSTEM100 at 100kV and aberration corrected JEOL 2200FS STEM at 200kV. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was performed on the Nion while energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on the JEOL. Elemental analysis was conducted at Georgia Tech Renewable Bioproducts Institute utilizing inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) by PerkinElmer OPTIMA 7300 DV after dissolving the metal oxides by caustic fusion and acid digestion. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) was conducted at the Advanced Photon Sources (APS), Argonne National Lab (ANL), at beamline 12-BM. The data were obtained in transmission mode at the Ni K-edge (8333eV) in the range of 8130–9190eV, and the Co K-edge (7712eV) in the range of 7510–8260eV, both with a spot size of 0.5mm×1.2mm. To perform the in situ reduction XAS experiments, the catalyst sample was diluted and ground with boron nitride, and then ∼1mg sample was loaded into a 1/16″ quartz tube held in place by quartz wool. The quartz tube was secured in a sample holder with a gas inlet and outlet, and a coil heater was centered along the catalyst. An XAS scan was taken before reduction at room temperature. Next the catalyst was heated to 500°C at 5°C/min and held for 1h, all while under a 10mL/min flow of 4% H2/He. Transient scans were collected during the reduction. After the reduction was complete, the sample was cooled in He, and a final scan was collected at room temperature. The XAS data were processed and analyzed with Athena software including background removal, edge-step normalization, and Fourier transform."
5,Reaction studies,"2.4 Reaction studies Vapor phase reactions were performed in a ¼″ tubular stainless steel reactor located inside a furnace. The catalyst was pelletized (120–170mesh), diluted with SiC (200–400mesh) and loaded into the reactor between layers of SiC (46mesh) and quartz wool. The catalyst was reduced in situ under 60mL/min H2 (Airgas, UHP) to 500 °C at 5°C/min and held for one hour. Once the reduction was completed, the bed was cooled under N2 (Airgas, UHP) to reaction temperature. Unless stated otherwise, reactions were conducted in a flow of 60mL/min of H2. Furfural was pumped into the vaporization zone at a rate of 5.5mmol/h (∼2.5mol% ethylene glycol diethyl ether as internal standard). The furfural flow met heated H2 (H2/furfural approximately 25) in the vaporization zone, which was heated to approximately 165°C. The vapor flowed through the catalyst bed at temperatures fixed in the range of 155°C–175°C, and then it flowed into an online Agilent 7890A GC through lines heated to approximately 180°C to minimize condensation. Selectivity and conversion were determined by the internal standard method, and carbon balances closed within 5% unless stated otherwise. After the reaction or reduction was completed, the catalyst was passivated for one hour at room temperature under 1% O2/N2 (Airgas) before removal from the reactor, separated from SiC, and stored under argon for further characterization studies."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization LDH materials were synthesized as the precursors to the mixed metal oxide catalysts due to the large variability of metal cations that can be introduced during synthesis. LDH precursors allow for synthesis of materials with fairly consistent physical properties even when various metals and metal ratios are used. Once these materials are calcined there is an emergence of high porosity and surface area, and additionally, high dispersion of metal oxides can be achieved. This suggests the potential for high interaction of the metallic species with oxide species once the mixed metal oxide is partially reduced compared to catalysts prepared by traditional wetness impregnation techniques. The physical properties of the catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The catalysts are named according to their metal molar ratio determined through ICP-OES, normalized to Al content. As shown in Table 1, the LDH derived synthesis yielded porous mixed metal oxides with relatively high BET surface areas ranging from 150–300m2/g. In general, calcined Co samples had lower surface areas than Mg samples, and Co-Al had the lowest surface area of all the catalysts, which may be due to the larger ionic radius of Co2+ over Mg2+ and the potential for Co2+ to oxidize to Co3+ [30,37]. According to ICP-OES results, the synthesized Co catalysts did not reach the target molar ratios. Since Co has the ability to oxidize to the 3+ oxidation state, the presence of large amounts of Co may have caused a charge imbalance that did not allow its full incorporation into the precursor hydrotalcite structure [38]. XRD patterns obtained for the uncalcined samples showed characteristic layered structures such as the (003) and (006) peaks (Fig. S1), whereas the XRD patterns of the calcined catalysts shown in Fig. 1 above, lack such sharp crystalline peaks. Interestingly, as the Co content increased, the intensity of the peaks decreased, which is similar to the phenomenon observed upon incorporation of Co into Mg-Al LDH materials [39]. Once the samples were calcined in air, the crystalline layered structures vanished and the XRD patterns contained only small, moderately broad peaks (Fig. 1). The lack of sharp peaks in Fig. 1 suggests the absence of large crystalline domains or clusters of metal oxides, which may help promote metal dispersion when reducing the catalysts. The three diffraction lines approximately at 37.5°, 42.5°, and 62.5° are difficult to conclusively assign since various metal oxides and spinels in the compositional system have reflections that overlap with the broad peaks (Fig. S2). The intensities of the Co sample peaks were severely diminished compared to the Mg samples, suggesting smaller domain sizes or a more amorphous structure. The absence of specific metal oxide domains may be explained by the homogeneous mixing of oxides that created a solid solution [23,40,41]. These solid solutions caused reduction of nickel to be significantly more difficult than for samples containing large nickel oxide domains, such as those often prepared by impregnation methods, due to the dispersion of the NiO domains and intermixing with other oxide species. Therefore, H2-TPR was a useful tool in determining the reduction profiles of the mixed metal oxides. The reduction behavior of each mixed metal oxide is displayed in Fig. 2 , and the total hydrogen uptake is given in Table S1. The TPR profiles contained many different features due to the compositional complexity of the mixed metal oxides. Under these conditions, MgO and Al2O3 are unreducible, but Ni2+, Co3+, and Co2+ are reducible. Starting with the more complex TPR profiles, the Ni-Co-Al catalysts displayed larger hydrogen uptakes as the temperature increased. The addition of Co resulted in the emergence of a peak at lower temperatures (∼250°C). This suggests that during calcination in air, Co3O4 domains evolved, and at lower temperatures, Co3O4 was reduced to CoO [42]. The very broad uptake could result from a mixture of many different oxide species being reduced, including Ni2+ and Co2+. According to prior literature, the low temperature shoulder is due to the reduction of surface Ni2+ to Ni°, which is followed by the reduction of bulk Ni2+ to metallic Ni [23,25,43]. Although XRD does not provide evidence for any spinel structures (NiAl2O4 or NiCo2O4), as the temperatures rise above 600°C, the reduction of more recalcitrant (perhaps highly embedded) Ni or Co species clearly occurred [44,45]. As the Ni content was increased, the apex of the broad peak shifted slightly to lower temperatures, confirming that Ni oxide species required less thermal energy to reduce. Along with the shift in the broad peak, the Co3O4 peak shifted towards lower temperatures as well, which alludes to the potential of Ni assisting in the reduction of Co. Similar to the addition of Pt to Co/Al2O3, the more easily reducible Ni may assist in the reduction of cobalt oxide through H2 dissociation and spillover [42]. Therefore, not only does NiO reduce to metallic Ni, but it is possible that CoO is reduced to metallic Co under specific reduction conditions. Unfortunately, these TPR profiles cannot give a detailed depiction of the reduced species. Consequently, spectroscopic studies were conducted to probe this, as discussed further below. Unlike the Co samples, the Ni-Mg-Al catalysts showed significantly less hydrogen uptake due to the unreducible (under these conditions) MgO. Similar to the Co samples, there was a shift of the main peak to lower temperatures as the amount of Ni in the catalyst increased. The Ni-Mg-Al profiles displayed a prominent lower temperature shoulder, suggesting that more NiO had segregated to the surface from embedded NiO species. The potential for more segregated surface species allowed for production of larger Ni domains during reduction (see below). Overall, these mixed metal oxides derived from LDH precursors create highly embedded oxide species, which yields higher reduction temperatures compared to samples prepared by wetness impregnation. For the vapor phase reaction studies, 500°C was chosen as the pre-reduction temperature to create a bifunctional catalyst with the partial reduction of the reducible oxide species. Metallic Ni or Co is expected to act as the hydrogenation site, while the hydrophilic oxide support would facilitate adsorption of the highly oxygenated furfural molecule."
8,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance Initial high furfural conversion testing (90–99.5%) was completed using all the catalysts to compare selectivities and activities under conditions relevant to practical application. Further studies on several catalysts at low conversion proceeded the initial high conversion tests to compare intrinsic activity. Reactions were conducted at 155°C, a pressure of about 1atm, and a H2/furfural molar ratio of 25. The major pathway for all reactions was hydrogenation of the aldehyde to produce furfuryl alcohol, followed by side or sequential products yielding products such as THFA, furan, and 2-methylfuran. The major product obtained for each catalyst was furfuryl alcohol, which resulted from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde of furfural to an alcohol. In prior literature, it has been established that bifunctional catalysts that contain a reduced metal and an oxide such as Ir-ReOx/SiO2 are highly active and selective towards unsaturated aldehyde hydrogenation [26]. The oxide is suggested to adsorb the oxygen of the aldehyde and the zero valent metal hydrogenates the carbonyl over the “bifunctional” catalyst. The Ni mixed metal oxides reduced in situ may create similar bifunctionalities due to the formation of Ni and/or Co metallic phases embedded in a solid solution metal oxide support. The oxide support may allow for strong interaction of the aldehyde with the catalyst, while the reduced metal hydrogenates the carbonyl species. Furthermore, the LDH synthesis method allows for strong interactions between the oxide and the reduced metal due to the relative homogeneity of the starting mixed metal oxide. In general, the Ni-Co-Al catalysts produced slightly more furfuryl alcohol than the Ni-Mg-Al materials, and the major outliers were 2Ni-Al and Co-Al due to the large amounts of side products or sequential products formed. Other products were formed through hydrogenation, decarbonylation, and hydrogenolysis pathways. Further hydrogenation through ring saturation occurred in all catalysts except Co-Al, potentially due to reduced Ni allowing for flat adsorption of furfuryl alcohol at low temperatures, leading to reduction of the olefinic bonds [14]. The second major side product was furan, resulting from decarbonylation of furfural, which has been shown to form over Ni catalysts at high temperatures [13]. Prior studies revealed that furan production is due to the strong η2(C,O) adsorption of the aldehyde, which seems to be more predominant over the Mg catalysts [13]. When Co was incorporated into the Ni mixed metal oxide, 2-methylfuran production increased slightly; moreover, Co-Al, which contained no Ni species, produced a significant amount of 2-methylfuran. Additional, minor ring-opening products were formed, including 1-butanol and 1,2-pentanediol, but were in insignificant amounts. Activities per gram of catalyst are displayed in Table 2 , and it can be seen that the 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al catalyst showed the highest activity per gram. Further investigation at lower furfural conversions of 1.9Ni-Mg-Al, 1.4Ni-1.4Mg-Al, 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al, 0.7Ni-1.1Co-Al, and 2Ni-Al were conducted to compare catalysts with various metal ratios under conditions that reduced side reactions and sequential reactions. Table 3 displays the activity per gram and per active site, as estimated by CO chemisorption (for chemisorption data, see Table S2). Due to the potential for multiple CO species forming on the metallic surfaces, including monodentate and bidendate CO, it was assumed that each adsorbed CO corresponded to 1.5 active sites [46–50]. The active site estimation by CO chemisorption may be slightly overstated for each catalyst due to potential titration of Lewis acid sites with CO, but previous literature has used CO adsorption to estimate metallic sites on similar catalysts based on LDH derived mixed metal oxides [30,51,52]. The 1.4Ni-1.4Mg-Al catalyst gave slightly higher CO adsorption than both the 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al and 2Ni-Al materials. Even though the dispersion and estimated particle size ranged between approximately 2.5–5.5% and 18 nm–38nm, respectively, these values are likely not a good representation of the morphology (Table S1) of the metal species. Mixed metal oxides derived from LDH precursors yield highly embedded metallic species after reduction, which can yield lower exposed metallic surface areas [53]. Consequently dispersion will be understated in such materials, while particle diameter will be overstated. Others have reported the use of base metal catalysts for furfural hydrogenation as well. Reduced Cu impregnated on SiO2 was employed for vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural and displayed high selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol (99%). Similarly, Ni impregnated on SiO2 showed high selectivity towards THFA at a low temperature of 130°C (94%) [14,15,54]. For furfural conversion to furfuryl alcohol, Tomishige et al. reported a TOF of 130h−1 at 130°C using a 10wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst, and Mérida-Robles et al. reported a TOF of 9.6h−1 for an 8wt% Cu/SiO2 catalyst at 170°C. Although these studies were conducted at different temperatures, the site-time-yields (STYs) of both 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al and 2Ni-Al demonstrate these materials to have promising activity for furfural hydrogenation (Table 3); however, improvements in selectivity by reducing formation of decarbonylation products are needed to compete with the best catalysts. Low conversion testing also supported the observation at higher furfural conversions of higher activity (per gram catalyst) associated with the 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al compared to all other catalysts tested at low conversion. Also, both Co catalysts showed higher activity per site compared to both Mg samples. The activity per site, as measured by CO chemisorption, showed an almost three times higher activity of the 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al catalyst compared to 1.4Ni-1.4Mg-Al and 1.9Ni-Mg-Al samples. The 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al catalyst had more than a 50% site-time-yield than 2Ni-Al, suggesting the addition of Co had a positive effect on activity, unlike Mg addition. In terms of selectivity, very little difference was observed compared to high conversion tests except for slightly higher furfuryl alcohol selectivity due to reduced sequential reactions. The 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al catalyst was used at low conversion to investigate the effects of temperature on the reaction rate, with the results displayed in Table 4 . Increasing the temperature increased the activity, as expected, while also changing the product distribution. Slightly greater amounts of furan and 2-methylfuran were produced with the increase in temperature, which has been noted in a previous report utilizing Ni catalysts [13]. The use of TPR and XRD together did not allow for sufficient insight into the nature of the reduced metallic species. To this end, XAS and XPS were applied to further elucidate the states of Ni and Co. In situ XAS under reduction conditions similar to the reaction pretreatment was utilized to give insight into the bulk characteristics of the 1.4Ni-1.4Mg-Al and 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al catalysts (Figs. 3 and 4 ). XAS was conducted in a quartz tube that was heated to 500°C at 5°C/min and held for 1h, all while under 10mL/min 4% H2 (balance He). Scans were taken throughout the reduction process, but only pre and post reduction conditions are presented here. The quality of the EXAFS spectrum can significantly diminish as temperature rises, especially temperatures above 600K, due to significant changes in the Debye-Waller factor, which adjusts for the thermal vibration effects [55–57]. For this reason, room temperature spectra were used to allow for ease of EXAFS processing and comparison. Both the Ni K-edge and the Co K-edge were interrogated to determine if Co also reduced under the pretreatment conditions employed in this work. Fig. 3 displays the Ni K-edge XAS results for both the 1.4Ni-1.4Mg-Al and 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al samples at room temperature before and after reduction at 500°C. Qualitatively, both XANES spectra showed a shift in the white line to lower energies as well as a decrease in the intensity; however, the Mg catalyst showed a much more significant shift and reduction in intensity, suggesting larger amounts of NiO reduced to Ni° in this catalyst [53,58]. The pre reduction spectra for both the Co and Mg containing samples mimicked the NiO spectrum due to the presence of the pre-edge feature at 8333eV and the major peak at 8352eV. After reduction for an hour at 500°C, the pre-edge feature disappeared for the Mg catalyst and the appearance of a second edge started, similar to that of Ni foil [59,60]. Moreover, when examining the derivative norm(E) (Fig. S5) there was an increase in the peak at 8333eV and a decrease in peaks at 8342eV and 8346eV, which was more characteristic of Ni foil reference. The Co catalyst displayed a smaller shift in the white line of the Ni K-edge, suggesting a simultaneous reduction of both Ni and Co. The Mg samples do not have that reduction competition since MgO and Al2O3 are not reducible under these conditions, allowing for significantly more reduction of the NiO species. In terms of the Co catalyst, there were still strong characteristic NiO features after reduction, including the small pre-edge feature at 8333eV; therefore, there was clearly less reduction of Ni in the Ni-Co-Al catalyst, relative to the Ni-Mg-Al catalyst. Overall, both catalysts did not have 100% reduction of Ni2+ to Ni°, possibly due to the large amount of imbedded Ni2+ species in the well-mixed oxide as well as strong interactions with the oxide support, as supported by TPR results, unlike traditional impregnated Ni catalysts [14]. EXAFS spectra displayed significant changes between the pre and post reduction catalyst samples, especially with the first two major scattering peaks. For both pre-reduction samples, two major peaks were present: a first peak at ∼1.5Å and a second peak at ∼2.5Å, corresponding to Ni-O and Ni-Ni (or Ni-Co) scattering, respectively [61,62]. After pretreatment, each catalyst showed a large increase in the Ni-Ni (Ni-Co) peak, which suggested an increase in the coordination number and formation of metallic Ni particles or Ni-Co alloys. Although both samples showed an increase of the metal-metal peaks after reduction, the Mg sample also showed a slight shift to lower atomic scattering distances, suggesting a larger degree of agglomeration of the Ni atoms. This larger agglomeration was potentially due to the larger amount of Ni atoms present on the surface of the mixed oxide, as shown by the larger shoulder at lower reduction temperatures in the TPR data. Even though there was a large increase in the magnitude of the second peak of the Co sample, there was no shift in the second peak, which suggests less Ni agglomeration due to the Co addition. From TPR, it was suggested that Co begins mainly as a Co3O4 that was reduced to CoO at low temperatures. However, from the TPR data over these samples, at higher temperatures it was uncertain when CoO reduction began. The in situ XAS spectra of the Co-containing sample at the Co k-edge before and after reduction, as shown in Fig. 4, do not display characteristics of significant metallic Co, as the post reduction white line mimics CoO from prior literature [63]. However, the EXAFS spectrum showed a small increase in the second scattering peak corresponding to Co-Co (Co-Ni), suggesting a slight increase in the coordination number, which could result from total reduction of some Co oxide species to metallic Co or development of alloyed, metallic CoNi domains [64]. XPS spectra of the catalysts before and after reduction in hydrogen further support the hypothesis that some Co oxide species were reduced to metallic Co, which may contribute to increased activity (Table 3) of the catalyst. XPS spectra shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate the partial reduction of CoO to metallic cobalt. Peak deconvolution of the spectra, including multiplet splitting and Auger peaks, was conducted similar to prior literature using standard references analyzed on the same instrument [65–68]. The experimental conditions were slightly different than those for the XAS experiments, since post-reduction XPS was conducted after the catalysts were passivated in 1% O2 (balanceN2) for one hour, which was necessary to transfer the sample from the reactor to the XPS instrument. Deconvolution of the Co region revealed that the main species present before reduction was Co3O4, which was reduced to Co2+ and Co° after reduction. This was noticeable mainly through the increase in the 2p3/2 satellite peak (786.7eV), since many of the Co3O4 and Co2+ 2p3/2 peaks were similar. After reduction at 500°C and passivation at room temperature, the major species present was CoO, with a quantifiable amount of Co° that caused the shoulder at lower binding energies. Even after passivation, by analyzing the 2p3/2 deconvolution, approximately 15% Co° species remained on the surface of the catalysts, hence adding to the metallic surface area of the catalyst. XPS conducted around the Ni binding energy region displayed reduction results that were consistent with those gleaned from the previously mentioned characterization techniques (TPR, XAS). After passivation of the 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al sample, the amount of Ni° on the surface was approximately 19% compared to the 1.4Ni-1.4Mg-Al sample, which had 14% Ni°. Although this may at first glance appear to differ with the results from XAS, which showed more extensive reduction, the post-reduction XPS results were from a sample that experienced a passivation step, which reoxidizes some of the reduced metal in the catalysts. When considering the combined results, the XPS and XAS of the 1.4Ni-1.4Mg-Al catalyst gave evidence of significant agglomeration of Ni, likely due to the presence of more Ni species on the surface after calcination compared to the 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al sample. This would yield more accessible Ni° species, which after passivation yielded less Ni°, as observed in the XPS results. The combined spectroscopic studies demonstrated that there was the emergence of metallic Ni in the Ni-Mg-Al catalyst and both metallic Ni and Co species in the Ni-Co-Al sample. However, these techniques were unable to determine the interactions between the two metallic species in the Ni-Co-Al catalyst. Aberration-corrected STEM allowed the morphology of both the reduced and unreduced catalysts to be probed, and EDS and EELS were conducted to complement the imaging. Fig. 6 displays a HAADF-STEM image of a nanoparticle approximately 5nm in size on the reduced 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al sample, which had been reduced at similar conditions and then passivated for 1h in 1% O2 (balance N2) for sample transfer to the microscope. Two major domains can be distinguished in the nanoparticle through fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis: the center domain contains either Ni and/or Co and the outer edge contains either NiO and/or CoO. Lattice analysis cannot discern if the particle is a mixture of Ni and Co or just an individual species; therefore, EELS and EDS were used to probe the compositions (Fig. S8, S9, and S10). Both methods provide evidence that suggests a random mixture of Ni and Co species, which hints that upon reduction, NiCo alloys were produced when both metals were present in the sample. This EELS and EDS certainly support the emergence of NiCo alloys previously observed by the other techniques. The hypothesis that bimetallic nanoparticles emerge after reduction may offer an explanation for the enhanced catalytic activity in the 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al compared to both 2Ni-Al and 1.4Ni-1.4Mg-Al, where no bimetallic particles can be formed under the reduction conditions employed. The intimate mixing of each metal species may facilitate hydrogen spillover to CoO, which may allow CoO to reduce simultaneously, ultimately being a factor in the increase in activity. From XAS, XPS, and STEM results, the oxide species present after reduction were a mixture of NiO, CoO, and Al2O3, which may have been a more useful combination than NiO, MgO, and Al2O3. Lastly, it is interesting to note that the metallic species do not seem to significantly change the overall fufuryl alcohol selectivity, but the nature of the oxide species does produce changes in the nature of the different side products observed."
9,Conclusions,"Porous nickel mixed metal oxide catalysts were synthesized by calcination of LDH derived materials to investigate the effects of various oxophilic metal additions to the structure and reactivity of the Ni metal particles. LDH derived mixed metal oxides allowed for the comparison of various metal additions to Ni based catalysts on the conversion of furfural under vapor phase hydrogenation conditions. In the calcined mixed metal oxide materials a homogeneous solid solution was formed with no observed separation of oxide domains as shown by XRD, suggesting close interactions between the Ni and other metals. TPR profiles suggested complex reduction behavior in the materials due to the various reducible species present in the mixed metal oxides including surface NiO, bulk NiO, Co3O4, and CoO species. Under the reduction conditions employed, neither Ni nor Co were fully reduced, which is attributed to metallic particles embedded in an oxide structure, likely with strong metal-support interactions. At high furfural conversion in a flow reactor, furfuryl alcohol was the major product produced. The inclusion of different oxophilic metals (Co vs. Mg) in varied amounts influenced the product distribution (mildly) and activity (more significantly) of the catalysts. In general, Mg catalysts showed less activity per site and slightly higher furan production, while the Co catalysts showed higher activity per site and slightly higher 2-methylfuran production. At low conversions, the STY of the 1.1Ni-0.8Co-Al was more than three times that of the 1.4Ni-1.4Mg-Al catalyst and 50% greater than the catalyst with no metal addition (2Ni-Al). Through extensive spectroscopic characterization by XAS and XPS, the increase in activity was attributed to the increased homogeneity of the Ni-Co catalysts, which gave metallic domains associated with both Ni° and Co°. STEM and EELS characterization supported the hypothesis that NiCo alloys may have formed in the catalysts containing both metals. Further studies varying the calcination temperature and reduction temperature could potentially allow for tuning of the nature of the reduced species in the NiCo catalyst, further influencing the activity and product distribution."
