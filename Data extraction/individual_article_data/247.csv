0,Introduction,"Treatment of phenolic wastewater with high non biodegradable toxic organic pollutants has increasingly become a bottleneck that restricts the development of pharmaceutical and chemical industry, it is considered one of the key problems which need to be solved primarily in the control of water pollution. As a typical phenolic wastewater, coking wastewater is contaminated with phenol, ammonia, cyanide, PAHs, as well as certain concentration of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds [1,2]. The treatment issue is always a sore point within the coke and coal gasification industry. The high phenol content is one of the most challenging industrial effluents for biological treatment due to its toxic and biorefractory nature [3,4]. Considering the high toxicity and pollution of the series of benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and phenolics, some biochemical methods are used to treat coking wastewater, such as activated sludge method [5], Fenton oxidation [6], chemical coagulation and flocculation techniques [7], adsorption [8], membrane separation technique [9]. However, the degradation of substances with benzene rings is still a problem that industry community, coking wastewater treatment cannot be solved by any single technology. Therefore, new methods for coking wastewater treatment are urgently required. In the absence of sufficient oxidant, supercritical water partial oxidation (SCWPO) could rapidly and efficiently convert organic compounds to fuel gases [10–12]. Organic molecules react in and with water to form the main gaseous products, CH4, H2 and CO2 [13]. The green technology has been widely concerned in the treatment of high concentration organic wastewater and wet organic solid wastes [14–16]. Economical alkali addition is an effective method of H2 production enhancement, which is the main target of SCWPO of biomass. NaOH and Na2CO3 are compared commonly used alkali catalysts to enhance significantly H2 yield via the water-gas shift reaction acceleration [17]. Due to the nature of CO2 capture and increasing alkalinity, NaOH addition is better able to improve biogas yield and H2 purity than Na2CO3 addition [18]. Many reactive metal catalysts are also available to improve the gasification reaction in sub- and supercritical water [17]. Ni catalyst has been widely applied due to its relatively low cost, the conversion of biomass to H2-rich gas can be accelerated noticeably [19,20]. In order to further tap potential of H2 production, combined alkali addition and metal catalysts were proposed to enhance H2 production during SCWPO process, H2 yield was higher than the theoretical sum from the combined catalytic SCWPO by 10–33% [21]. In previous work, catalytic SCWPO achieved higher hydrogen gasification efficiency (HGE), but it also brought more dimers generation, which are the main precursors of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [22]. Through more oxidation involved in SCWPO reaction, PAHs formation was effectively inhibited at the sacrifice of H2 production [23,24]. Theoretically, the oxidation coefficient (O/C) value of 1 represents complete oxidation demand for SCW reaction. But in actual applications, the excess oxygen has to reach 300% before there is enough oxidant capacity to achieve the complete destruction of pollutants [25]. SCWPO technology is an efficient and environment friendly that using supercritical water as reaction media to degrading refractory organic compounds completely with excessive oxidant [26], while it aims to generate H2-rich biogas in the absence of enough oxidant [27]. To some extent, the Ni-H2O2 additive mixture achieved the enhancement of H2 production and the inhibition of PAHs formation considerably compared with either single additive [28,29]. Combined addition could be a solution for energy recovery and pollutants control during SCWPO process. Commonly used alkali additions or metal catalysts played a role in promoting hydrogen production from different gasification pathways [21], NaOH and Ni catalysts were chosen as combined catalysts due to their economy and efficiency. In this study, the SCWPO of coking wastewater using H2O2 as oxidant in the presence of combined NaOH-Ni catalysts was investigated to enhance H2 production and phenolics degradation: (i) the effect of OR on the removal of volatile phenol, phenol, TOC and HGE and gasification efficiency; (ii) the effect of alkali addition and Ni catalyst on the removal of volatile phenol, phenol, TOC and HGE and gasification efficiency; (iii) the effect of combined NaOH-Ni catalysts on the removal of volatile phenol, phenol, TOC and HGE and gasification efficiency; (iv) the effect of combined NaOH-Ni catalyst on the transformation of cyclic compounds; and (v) the corrosion performance of Ni catalyst during SCWPO process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The coking wastewater sample used in this case was collected from a coal coking plant in Maanshan city, Anhui province, whose characteristics are shown in Table 1 . 30 wt% H2O2 solution served as the oxidant. NaOH and Ni were applied to catalyze SCWPO reaction of coking wastewater, which were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., which were of analytical reagent, HPLC/ACS grade methanol (CH3OH, purity ≥ 99.9%) purchased from ANPEL Laboratory Technologies (Shanghai) Inc."
3,Experimental setup and procedures,"2.2 Experimental setup and procedures Experimental setup and procedures follow the previous work [22]. The reactions were constructed by quartz tubings of 2 mm internal diameter. 60 μL coking wastewater sample was injected to maintain reaction pressure of 23 MPa when the temperature rose to 400 °C. NaOH addition was proportionately dissolved with a certain amount of coking wastewater feedstock in advance, and Ni catalyst was directly added into quartz tubes in certain preset ratio of Ni amount to the 60 μL coking wastewater samples. After samples loading, the quartz tubing was sealed to keep an internal volume of 0.47 mL by an oxyhydrogen flame sealing machine (OKFKJ-300, Walker Energy Co., Ltd.). The temperature was preheating up to 400 °C with a constant heating rate of 20 °C min−1, before the sealing tube reactor was put into the muffle furnace. The timer was started when the temperature of the muffle furnace rose to 400 °C again. After set reaction time of 900 s, removed the reactor from the muffle furnace and allowed it to cool down naturally to room temperature. The cooled quartz tube was put in a special polyethylene pipe collector, and the valves were closed when nitrogen gas completely evacuated the residual air. A syringe was used to collect a 2 mL gaseous sample from one port of the pipe collector after the destruction of the inside quartz tube. Meanwhile, another parallel quartz tube reactor was cut for preparing the liquid phase, which was extracted using a microliter. The experiments were repeated three times for each parameter variation."
4,Analysis methods,"2.3 Analysis methods Gaseous composition were analyzed using a gas chromatography (GC1690, Shimadzu Japan) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The volatile phenol was detected by 4-AAP spectrophotometric method (HJ 503-2009). The phenol content was detected using a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UFLC-2010 Plus, Shimadzu Japan) with a C-18 reverse column. Total organic carbon (TOC) content was also analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-VCPH, Shimadzu Japan). The organic intermediates were extracted from the liquid phase by liquid-liquid microextraction, and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS QP2010 Plus; Shimadzu Japan) with a HP-5MS capillary column. The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the liquid phase was also performed on an ELEOS System GPC instrument (Wyatt, USA) with THF as the eluent. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of raw and used Ni catalyst were recorded analyzed using a D/max-Ultima IV instrument at room temperature with Cu Kα radiation. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were also analyzed using the KBr pellet method by a FT-IR spectrometer (6700, Nicolet USA) at the tested wavelength of 4000–50 cm−1."
5,Data interpretation,"2.4 Data interpretation The oxygen ratio (OR), carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) and hydrogen gasification efficiency (HGE), the degradation of volatile phenol (RVP), phenol (RP) and TOC (RTOC) were respectively defined as follows: O R = [ O 2 ] 0 [ C O D ] 0 where, [O2]0 is the oxygen formed from release of H2O2 addition. [COD]0 is is the initial COD of feedstock. H G E ( % ) = [ H ] b i o g a s [ H ] r a w f e e d s t o c k × 100 % C G E ( % ) = [ C ] b i o g a s [ C ] r a w f e e d s t o c k × 100 % where, [H]biogas, [C]biogas, [H]raw feedstock and [C]raw feedstock are mass fraction of hydrogen, carbon in gaseous products and raw coking wastewater, respectively. R V P % = [ V P ] i n f - [ V P ] e f f [ V P ] i n f × 100 % R P % = [ P ] i n f - [ P ] e f f [ P ] i n f × 100 % R T O C % = [ T O C ] i n f - [ T O C ] e f f [ T O C ] i n f × 100 % where, [VP]inf, [P]inf and [TOC]inf are the initial influent volatile phenol, phenol and TOC concentration of raw coking wastewater, [VP]eff, [P]eff and [TOC]eff represent the remained effluent concentration in the liquid products, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of oxidation condition on SCWPO of coking wastewater,"3.1 Effect of oxidation condition on SCWPO of coking wastewater The oxidant dosage is a key aspect in SCWPO process of high strength coking wastewater considering organic pollutants degradation and H2 production. From Fig. 1 a, it was found that higher OR was advantageous for phenolics and other organic pollutants converting to gaseous products from SCWPO without any catalyst addition. The actual oxidant consumption of complete oxidation was measured to be far more than its theoretical value in supercritical water. The removal percentages of volatile phenol, phenol and TOC were respectively 51.00%, 43.59% and 68.08% at 1.0 OR. Complete degradation of organic pollutants was obtained within 300% excess oxygen at 650 °C, 25 MPa and 24 s [25]. And the destruction of N-containing heterocyclic compounds in coking wastewater can generate stable intermediate compound ammonia [30,31], which manifests as high NH3–N concentration residue in effluent. Combined with a large amount of remained volatile phenol, phenolic compounds may well combine with ammonia to form toxic and stable aniline compounds. Apart from phenolic compounds, even in case of not enough oxidants involving small molecular organic matters in coking wastewater would have been able to degrade into H2-rich gas. H2 production peaked at 0.5 OR, 24.66% of HGE was sharply limited as oxidant dosage increased. 0.5 of OR was an advantageous condition for energy recovery from SCWPO of coking wastewater. However, the remained organic pollutants leave much to be desired in this system."
8,Effect of separate and combined catalyst on SCWPO of coking wastewater,"3.2 Effect of separate and combined catalyst on SCWPO of coking wastewater 3.2.1 Effect of separate NaOH or Ni addition In this section, the influence of alkali addition was examined in order to improve process efficiency. All experiments were carried out with a reactor configuration at 400 °C of reaction temperature, 23 MPa of pressure, 900 s of time, 35 °C/min of heating rate and 0.5 of OR. From Fig. 2 a, it was found that the efficiency of TOC removal in NaOH addition obviously inhibited by near 30%, high content of phenol and volatile phenol remained in liquid phase. While the high expectations for alkali addition were not met, we think organic substances removal in alkali catalytic SCWPO could be effectively improved. More dimers formed from the combination of phenol with a phenoxy group and subsequent dehydration under high NaOH addition [22]. NaOH addition displayed an obvious impact on the reaction rate and priority shift. A reversible dimerization of phenol and gasifiable organics to dibenzofuran becomes the dominant primary reaction during alkali catalytic SCWPO (Huelsman and Savage, 2013). As is illustrated in Fig. 2b, alkali addition promoted the water-gas shift reaction in favor of H2-rich syngas production [18]. Furthermore, alkali chemicals addition can also facilitate CO2 capture and carboxylic acids neutralization, especially acetic acid, in solution at low temperatures. HGE were raised to 75.68% at OR of 0.5 and NaOH addition of 3.0%. NaOH addition synchronously improved the enrichment of C in liquid products and the enrichment of H in gas phase during alkali catalytic SCWPO process of coking wastewater. But from a gasification enhancement and organic pollution control point of view, the continuous enrichment of C was not always desirable. Naturally finding a new composite catalyst and an effective method to strengthen SCWPO technology to achieve gasification efficiency enhancement and organic pollution control becomes the focus of this thesis. Fig. 2c illustrates the effects of different separate Ni catalyst amount on TOC and phenolic substances removal from partial oxidation of coking wastewater at 400 °C for 900 s. The separate Ni catalysis of on gasification efficiency of coking wastewater is shown in Fig. 2d. When the amount of Ni catalyst was increased from 0 wt% to 3 wt%, the TOC and volatile phenol removal had improved remarkably, CGE increased from 52.24% to 75.36%, the phenol removal and HGE stayed relatively steady. NaOH addition showed its superiority in improving HGE as result of enhancing the water-gas shift reaction, while the CO and CH4 yields increased with Ni addition due to the methanation and steam reforming reaction [20,32]. This effect of Ni addition on methanation and steam reforming reactions could be explained by interaction between hydrogen and Ni and could be understood on the basis of a reaction scheme where H2 was adsorbed and dissociates on the Ni surface, providing atomic hydrogen that combines with carbon supplied from the glucose. Meanwhile, steam reforming reaction was also simultaneously brought a modicum of enhancement via the formate formation during Ni catalytic SCWPO [33]. In contrast to NaOH addition, Ni catalyst had obvious results in terms of phenolics degradation. So combined NaOH-Ni catalyst might be an effective means of phenolic wastewater treatment to help meet the simultaneous demands of hydrogen production and phenolics degradation. 3.2.2 Effect of combined NaOH-Ni catalyst Both separate NaOH and Ni catalyst could favorable improve H2 production. Metal catalysts were mainly useful in steam reforming and methanation reaction, while alkali addition showed a positive effect on the water-gas shift reaction. Effects of combined Ni and NaOH addition on SCWPO reaction were illustrated in Fig. 3 . Comparing to separate NaOH addition, the combined NaOH additive and Ni catalyst obviously promoted the degradation of volatile phenol, phenol and TOC, as well as separate Ni catalyst. The removal percentages of volatile phenol, phenol and TOC were respectively 55.24%, 72.55% and 85.24% at 1.0% NaOH + 2.0% Ni addition and 0.5 OR. Under this condition, the HGE reached an all-time high of 86.39% and the CGE was comparatively high of 60.34%. As the share of NaOH addition in the combined NaOH-Ni catalyst rose, more C content occurred in liquid products in form of inorganic carbonates by the capture of excess hydroxide and the transformation of the water-gas shift reaction. The combined NaOH-Ni catalyst played integration advantages of the H2 enhancement of NaOH addition and the organic pollutions control of Ni catalyst."
9,The reaction mechanism of combined NaOH-Ni catalyst,"3.3 The reaction mechanism of combined NaOH-Ni catalyst 3.3.1 GC-MS analysis GC-MS was used to separate and identify the compounds extracted from the liquid products of separate NaOH and combined NaOH-Ni catalytic SCWPO process. Fig. 4 showed the observed tentative identification of compounds from comparison with NIST-98 standard MS library. Only those compounds with peak area percentages over 1.00% were counted. 12 products were observed in the raw coking wastewater. Of these, the major products were phenolic substances with a benzene or double rings molecular structure, including methyl carbonate, m-cresol, quinoline, indol(e), phenylamine and o-cresol. The nitrogenous monoaromatic hydrocarbons remained fine stability of thermal process during the pyrogenic production procedure, which accounted for 80.04% of the total identified amounts. The percentages of the major six products were decreased slightly from SCWG process without any addition, which illustrated all of the original phenolic composition were potentially involved in SCWG reaction. There’s only 1,3-Diphenylguanidine appeared in the SCWG liquid products. The boiling point of 1,3-Diphenylguanidine illustrates that the generated nitrogenous monoaromatic hydrocarbons doesn’t fall into the category of volatile phenol. With connection to Fig. 1a, 14.30% of volatile phenol degradation was basically anastomotic with the percentage reduction of the major six products and the peak area of 1,3-Diphenylguanidine. SCWG was able to oxide gasifiable organic substances into H2-rich syngas, but in absence of sufficient oxidants it’s difficult to provide enough oxidizing power for complete oxidation of monoaromatic hydrocarbons with a closed cyclic conjugated system. Only 74.4% of phenol conversion achieved from SCWG of single phenol solution [22]. The coupling reaction of aryl compounds provided the corresponding symmetric 1,3-Diphenylguanidine [34]. With more H2O2 oxidant involved in SCW reaction, the determining amount of volatile phenol residue in liquid products was reduced to a considerable extent. SCWPO process facilitated the ring opening of monoaromatic hydrocarbons, and effectively promoted carbon migration from liquid products to syngas. However, the species of residual aryl compounds had increased from levels of SCWG liquid products of coking wastewater. There was even a certain amount of new tricyclic PAH radical group appearance. At 0.5 OR, the ring opening of monoaromatic hydrocarbons resulted in more species of incomplete oxidative intermediates involving in substitution reaction and addition reaction, which leaded to more species of aryl compounds appearance. Took the case of quinoline, it consists of a benzene ring and a fused pyridine ring with a nitrogen atom inside. The benzene ring would be vulnerable to be oxidized in SCWPO process due to its low electron cloud density in the pyridine ring [35]. A possible mechanism was illustrated as quinoline → secondary components → volatile species → gaseous products [36]. With insufficient active oxidizers, the first opening benzene ring and a little slower opening pyridine ring only happened at the beginning of SCWPO progress. Active oxidizers were basically consumed by the secondary components and the volatile species of reaction. More new aryl compounds generated from the reaction of the remaining quinoline, secondary components, volatile species and the other remaining quinoline and its derived secondary components, volatile species. Alkali addition, freely soluble in water, had been thought to promote the reaction between free radical and organic matters by providing extensive hydroxyl radical in SCW environment. The ring opening of monoaromatic hydrocarbons, however, had not been matched by increasing HGE from alkali catalytic SCWPO of coking wastewater. High NaOH addition served as the donor of the abundant hydroxyl radical for the water-gas shift reaction to enhance H2 production, but it could also lead to the coking and deposition of the phenolic compounds. The contact reaction between hydroxyl radical and gasifiable intermediates would be blocked, leading to lower processing efficiency. In contrast to NaOH addition, the species and quantities of organic intermediates in liquid products collected from separate Ni catalytic SCWPO of coking wastewater decreased significantly. N-containing and S- containing heterocycles were not detected any longer. Isopropyl acetate and 4-(hydroxymethyl)-7-methyl-1,3-dioxepane-5,6-diol were only detected in liquid product from combined NaOH and Ni catalytic SCWPO reaction. Not only was the organic intermediates free of N- or S- containing heterocycles compounds, but there was no trace of the benzene ring. 3.3.2 Molecular weight distribution MWD analysis was further performed to observe the polymerization and oxidation for coking wastewater. The liquid samples were obtained from raw coking wastewater and liquid products after partial oxidation. As shown in Fig. 5 , the MWD of raw coking wastewater was mainly concentrated in 5k-10 kDa, the similar results appeared in the liquid products after SCW processing expect NaOH SCWPO, which accounted for nearly 100%. Experiments of NaOH addition on polymer formation with phenol as a model compounds also validated the enhancement of hydrogen production and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation [22]. Combined with GC-MS analysis of raw coking wastewater and liquid products, the intermediates molecules of different molecular weights were basically composed of short chain compounds (including organic acids, alkanes, alcohols, esters, etc.), aromatic compounds and their derivatives, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic substances, and polycyclic alkenes substances. The molecular structure of the intermediates at molecular weight level >30k was mainly a macromolecular cyclic space structure with benzene ring, hydroxyl group, carboxyl group, methyl group or other functional groups. The molecular weight level of 10k–30k were mainly in long chain structure with benzene rings, hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups or heterocyclic nitrogen atoms. The intermediates with molecular weight level of 5k–10k were mainly relatively simple structures, which had probably benzene rings with nitrogen atoms, small molecular chain hydrocarbons or N-containing groups. Smaller molecular weight of about 5000 Da or less were probably cyclic compounds including MAHs, PAHs and heterocyclic compounds, with the aromatic hydrocarbons being the majority [37]. Table 2 listed the weight-average molecular weight, number-average molecular weight, and polydispersity index of the liquid samples. The GPC results showed that raw coking wastewater was a complex mixture with a relatively high average molecular weight. A sustained decrease was observed in Mn and Mw after SCWG and SCWPO treatment, the polymers with long chain structure and PAHs were partially converted into gasifiable products with smaller molecule weight. During NaOH catalytic SCWPO reaction, Mw is increased markedly from 5.36 × 103 Da to 222.40 × 103 Da. Larger Mw of the intermediates from check may possibly due to compounds with big size resulted from more polymeric reactions or the incomplete oxidation of macromolecules. As with low temperature hydrothermal liquefaction, SCWPO could be also effectively promoted by alkali catalyst, but the prevent of condensation reactions was exactly the opposite [38]. Effect of separate Ni addition on Mw of SCWPO liquid products was relatively lower than separate NaOH addition. Molecules with extremely large Mw disappeared, and PDI of 1.02 had also expressed a relatively concentrated molecular weight distribution. Under combined NaOH-Ni catalytic SCWPO, PDI of 3.16 had expressed a huge polydispersity, which represented a more complicated reaction system than separate addition catalytic SCWPO. Overall, the combined NaOH-Ni catalyst were favorable for hydrogen production and polymer inhibition. 3.3.3 The reaction mechanism of combined NaOH-Ni catalyst Based on the analysis of the effect of separate addition and combined NaOH-Ni catalyst on volatile phenol removal efficiencies, TOC, HGE, CGE, GC-MS and MWD, the possible catalysis mechanism was illustrated in Fig. 6 . The NaOH catalytic mechanism was mainly to generate NaCOOH which could react with water to form both H2 and NaHCO3, and to promote the water-gas shift reaction for enhancing H2 production [39]. Meanwhile, CO2 capture was favorable for H2 yield and purity by alkali addition [17,18]. Most of incomplete gasification intermediates and chemical groups were gathered into char or tar via the condensation reaction. Ni catalyst could significantly increase H2 production mainly via promoting the steam reforming reaction and methanation reaction [40]. The pathway of the condensation reaction could also be prevented during Ni catalytic SCWPO process. The incomplete gasification intermediates and chemical groups mainly existed in simple structures of 5k–10 k Da molecular weight. During combined NaOH-Ni catalytic SCWPO reaction, there wasalso a certain synergybetweenNaOH addition and Ni catalyst to enhance HGE and CGE [21]. The possible pathway was that NaOH addition was able to exert its influence on the water-gas shift reaction of gasifiable intermediates and Ni catalyst was additional to play its advantage in improving type and amounts of reaction of gasifiable intermediates. Therefore, when combined NaOH-Ni catalyst was involved in SCWPO reaction, H2 production was effectively enhanced while the polymer and its ring functional groups were also gradually inhibited. Overall, this effect of NaOH on H2 and CO2 generation as well can be explained by catalysis water-gas shift reaction via the formate formation. High H2 yield is obtained by reacting of formate with water. The catalytic cycle is completed by the formation of CO2 and Na2CO3. A disadvantage of the use of alkali addition is an increased phenol content, while Raney nickel decreases the phenols’ yield [33]. Phenolics, as the main precursors of PAHs and coke, has been identified experimentally that the reaction pathways influenced by the presence of a metal catalyst [41]. Ni catalyst obviously enhanced the ring opening and hydrolysis of phenols, cresols, polyphenols, benzene, while the reaction products such as alcokols, carboxylic acids, aldehydes and ketones provides the gasifiable intermediates for alkali catalysis water-gas shift reaction."
10,The corrosion of combined NaOH-Ni catalyst,"3.4 The corrosion of combined NaOH-Ni catalyst Compared with separate NaOH or Ni catalyst, combined NaOH-Ni could collaborated and integrated the advantages of gasification efficiency promoting and coking inhibition. The corrosion performance was often used to express the inactivationI of the heterogeneous catalyst after SCW reaction. The oxidation and corrosion of Ni catalyst surface was an urgent problem that an heterogeneous catalyst would be used multiple times before regeneration. It was important for characterizing the catalytiic efficiency of the repeated use of the Ni metal catalyst. Thus, in order to evaluate the efficiency of combined NaOH-Ni catalyst, the paper paid great attention to the corrosion performance of Ni catalyst with and without NaOH addition. Regardless of whether or not NaOH addition participated in the SCWPO reaction, the SEM results showed that there were significant difference in the surface appearance of the Ni catalyst. The nickel powder used in the test was of less than about 10 μm in diameter. In applications, the nickel powder possessed high specific surface area, and it expressed certain congeries behavior rather than separate particles morphology. Angular plateaus on its surface has replaced regular curved sphere in the routine realizes. After SCWPO reaction, no obvious angular plateaus retained on the surface as the nickel powder was covered with membrane. As illustrated in Fig. 7 , energy spectrum analysis was conducted to explore the composition of the surface membrane and evaluate the catalytic efficiency of the reusable Ni catalyst. Ni is the only detected element in the raw Ni powder. S, O and Si elements were found depositing on the surface of Ni powder as the SCWPO reaction progress with separate Ni catalyst, and the contents decreased in an order. Ni still remained the main element of the surface membrane. When NaOH involved in catalytic SCWPO reaction, O wasn’t found in the surface membrane of Ni catalyst, and more content of Ni atom was detected than separate Ni catalyst. The results shows that combined NaOH-Ni catalyst also has advantages in the resistance to oxidation and corrosion of Ni catalyst. XRD and FTIR analysis were conducted to compare the difference of Ni catalyst from combined NaOH-Ni catalytic SCWPO and separate Ni catalytic SCWPO. From Fig. 8 a, nearly consistent crystal type remained on the Ni powder surface from separate Ni catalytic SCWPO reaction. It's most likely hydrophobic organic matters covered on the surface membrane of Ni catalyst. Particulate char/coke bind to the active site of Ni catalyst, even larger-sized chunks of char/coke appeared on the surface [42]. Four significant spectrum peaks were collected from FITR analysis. The peaks and absorption bands were assigned according to infrared absorption characteristics of common groups of organic compounds. The 1068 cm−1 of absorption peaks location might represent the stretching vibration of CO functional group. The 1645 cm−1 of absorption peaks location most probably represent the stretching vibration of CC functional group on the aromatic rings. The 2929 cm−1 of absorption peaks was weak, which most likely represent the asymmetric stretching vibration of CH2 or CH3 on the aromatic rings. The 3496 cm−1 of absorption peaks was strong and wide, which most likely represent the OH functional group in alcohol and phenol with hydrogen bonds. Although Ni catalyst effectively enhanced the production of the gasifiable intermediate, higher Ni catalyst addition actually promotes more residual TOC in the liquid phase. Thus, more of substance was left behind on the surface of Ni powder during separate Ni catalytic SCWPO reaction, the catalysis reaction for hydrogen production, phenolics degradation was inhibited to a certain extent by cover of the active site of Ni catalyst. These hydrophobic compounds was isolating Ni catalyst from organic pollutions in coking wastewater. The Ni catalysis was blocked, leading in turn to a weakening of catalytic efficiency. However, the notable changes occurred in the crystallographic structure and surface property of Ni powder surface from combined NaOH-Ni catalytic SCWPO reaction. There were some new generated crystal structure appeared on the surface besides original Ni lattice. Compared with the hydrophobic char/coke, combined NaOH-Ni catalyst suffered slight effect from these inorganic matters."
11,Conclusions,"The effect of separate NaOH addition and Ni catalyst and H2O2 on the SCWPO of coking wastewater for H2 production and phenolics degradation has been examined. Results show that separate NaOH addition has more efficiency to generate hydrogen from coking wastewater than separate Ni catalyst. However, the addition of separate Ni catalyst exerts more advantages in phenolics degradation and polymer inhibition. Combined NaOH-Ni catalyst shows a certain synergy for H2 production and phenolics degradation during SCWPO reaction process. The best efficiency of catalytic H2 production and phenolics oxidation is achieved at a NaOH/Ni ratio of 1:2. Under the condition of 1.0% NaOH + 2.0% Ni addition and 0.5 OR, the HGE reached an all-time high of 86.39% and the CGE was comparatively high of 60.34%, and there are only isopropyl acetate and 4-(hydroxymethyl)-7-methyl-1,3-dioxepane-5,6-diol residueinthefinalliquid products.NaOH addition was able to exert its influence on the water-gas shift reaction of gasifiable intermediates and Ni catalyst was additional to paly its advantage in improving type and amounts of reaction of gasifiable intermediates. In terms of hydrogen production, phenolics degradation and Ni catalytic activation, combined NaOH-Ni catalyst could be an additive feasible for the degradation of the phenolics as the industrial application. Here further investigations on the relationship of wastewater properties with the addition ratio and amount are also necessary and desirable to pay close attention and study this theme intensively during combined NaOH-Ni catalytic SCWPO reaction."
