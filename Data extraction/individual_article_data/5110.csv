0,Introduction,"Polymeric matrix nanocomposites (PMNC) are polymer based composites which have nanosized fillers in their matrixes [1]. Nanofillers modify and improve properties of the polymer such as physical, mechanical and thermal properties [2]. This change in the polymer properties is occurred because of the unique high surface-to-volume ratio of the nanofillers [3]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a water-soluble, biodegradable polymer that has exceptional optical and physical properties and chemical resistance resulted in its use in the various applications such as biomedical devices [4], drug delivery [5], membrane technology [6] and fuel cells [7]. One of the main problems in the using of PVA films is the weak mechanical properties as compared to other petroleum-based polymers [8]. In the recent years, two types of nanofillers. i.e. organic types and mineral ones have been used to improve and reinforce the polymer properties. Among organic nanofillers, CNTs appear to be very effective reinforcement for the preparation of polymer nanocomposites [9]. However, CNTs as nanofillers have drawbacks such as high production costs and difficulty dispersion in polymer matrices due to the hydrophobic nature of them [10]. Also, in the graphene-based polymer nanocomposites, van der Waals interaction between graphene sheets prevent good graphene dispersion in the polymer matrices that causes low compatibility with PVA as a polymeric matrix [11]. Because of this problems, the functionalization of organic nanofillers and derivation of graphene such graphene oxide (GO)/ reduced graphene oxide (RGO), is considered to disperse this kind of nanofillers homogeneously in the hydrophilic PVA matrix [12]. However, functionalization suffers from additional chemical treatment on the primary organic nanofillers [13]. On the other hand, mineral nanofillers include different clays [14], metal nanoparticles (e.g. Ag, Au) and metal oxide nanoparticles (TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3) is being viewed depend on the final application of the prepared nanocomposite [15]. However, the most mineral nanofillers are limited in their biocompatibility and degradability features [16]. ZrO2 NPs are biocompatible and stable nanoparticles with an excellent refractoriness, chemical resistance, mechanical strength and low thermal conductivity. These features were caused to consider them as a suitable nontoxic inorganic nanofillers [17]. Up to now, numerous methods have been developed to synthesize ZrO2 NPs such as laser ablation [18], ball milling [19], spray pyrolysis [20] and sol-gel method [21]. The sol-gel process is a versatile solution process that possesses an advantage including low-temperature reaction, fine nanoparticles production and compositional control [22]. However, this method usually used an alkoxide precursor that has some drawbacks such as high cost of precursors and toxicity [23]. A non-alkoxide sol-gel process is a kind of sol-gel process that used a metal salts precursors along with in situ polymerization route that can form a stable complex [24]. The metallic cations immobilization in such branched polymer can limit the cation mobility during the heat treatment, causing the formation of fine nanoparticles [25]. Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) is a typical domestic herb and its extract has mainly consisted of phenolic compounds like rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid that could consider as a good candidate for chelating and stabilizing zirconium cations in this kind of sol-gel process [22,26]. Fig. 1 shows a the schematic of rosemary plant and the main polyphenolic compounds exist in the rosemary extract [27]. This method synthesized zirconia nanoparticles greenly using plant extract that minimizes the amounts of hazardous chemicals in the production process. This is the first report on the synthesis of ZrO2 nanoparticles using rosemary extract as a natural and non-toxic material. Then, a series of ZrO2-PVA nanocomposites films with various amounts of nanosized reinforcement was prepared by an ultrasonic assisted solution mixing method. The solution mixing method has advantages such as a simple, fast and cost-effective way to achieve nanocomposite films compare with other nanocomposite preparation method [28]. In addition, the use of sonication helps to better disperse nanoparticles in the PVA matrix [29]. Finally, the effect of zirconia addition on the mechanical property of prepared ZrO2-PVA nanocomposites is investigated. The purpose of this study is the preparation of eco-friendly PVA base nanocomposite base on zirconia nanofillers."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of ZrO2 nanoparticles,"2.1 Synthesis of ZrO2 nanoparticles Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaves were collected from a local garden in the Isfahan University of Technology and then were dried, powdered and treated with ethanol. Then, the prepared solution was cleaned and the solvent evaporated at 50 °C. After that, 300 mg of zirconium oxychloride octahydrate was dissolved in 30 mL of ethanol and the extracts were in 1: 1, 1: 2, 1: 3, 1: 4 and 1: 6 wt% was slowly added in a stirring condition at 70 °C/1h to obtain a clear solution. By adding 10 mL of distilled water to the solution and heating it for 12 h under a temperature of 120 °C a green gel was achieved. The green-synthesized gel was annealed for at 600 °C/2h. For comparison, 300 mg zirconium oxychloride octahydrate was dissolved in 30 mL of ethanol and 10 mL of distilled water was added and other steps were repeated again."
3,Preparation of PVA/ ZrO2 nanocomposites thin film,"2.2 Preparation of PVA/ ZrO2 nanocomposites thin film PVA nanocomposites were prepared in a series of plastic Petri dishes (100 mm Dia x 15 mm Deep). Typically, 600 mg PVA powder was added to 50 mL mixture of water/ethanol in a ratio of 2:3 and the pH value were adjusted to 8. Then, the as-synthesized ZrO2 nanoparticles were added to that solution and the mixture ultrasonicated again for 30 min. The resultant was decanted into Petri dishes and was dried at 60 °C/2h. The film thickness was controlled by using a similar amount of initial materials and the same sized petri dish (d = 0.4 mm). The amount of ZrO2 nanofiller into PVA polymer was varied between 0 and 5 wt%. Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram of the PVA/ZrO2 nanocomposites thin film preparation."

5,Results and discussion,
6,Zirconia nanoparticles analysis,"3.1 Zirconia nanoparticles analysis 3.1.1 Thermogravimetric analysis Fig. 3 shows TGA analysis of the as-prepared Zirconia gel before calculation step. The gel exhibits about 5 wt% weight loss at about 100–120 °C probably due to the dehydration step. A large weight loss of about 60 wt% for the thermal decomposition of organic compounds was observed at 385–530 °C [30]. According to the thermal analysis results, the temperature of 600 °C was elected for the calcination of zirconia gel. 3.1.2 FESEM analysis Fig. 4 shows the FESEM images of all prepared zirconia particles. As it can be seen in Fig. 4a, the sheet-like microparticles were obtained in the absence of rosemary extract. Fig. 4(b-e) shows the sample synthesized using the zirconia salt to the rosemary weigh percent equals to 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 and 1:6, respectively. It was noticed that in the case of using a low amount of rosemary extract, (Figs. 4b, 4c), the particle size of the sample was higher than 50 nm with some agglomerated. The smallest and spherical particles (about 12–17 nm) was obtained in Fig. 4d by using the salt precursor to rosemary of 1:4 wt%. The particle size was increased to about 25–30 nm by using 1:6 wt% of zirconia salt to rosemary extract. As noted in the introduction section, Rosemary extract is known as a rich source of polyphenols nutrients, including Rosmarinic acid and Carnous acid molecules. Here, it was assumed that these compounds act as stabilizing agents that inhibit the zirconia particles to be grown by the chelate bond between Zr+4 –COOH of rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid molecules. In addition, the high-temperature calcination of as-synthesized particles resulted in the decomposition of these compounds and produced large amount of gaseous like CO2 that helped in the formation of non-aggregated particles [31]. The green synthesized nanoparticles with the smallest particle size as compared to other samples (zirconia salt precursor to rosemary extract = 1:4 wt%) was chosen and more characterized. 3.1.3 FT-IR studies Fig. 5 shows the FTIR of sample before and after the calcination step at 600 °C. The decrease in intensity of organic compound peaks (the bands at 11,630 cm -1 and 1710 cm -1 due to vibrations of COOH group and 2922 cm -1 and 2854 cm -1 correspond to C-H vibrations [32]. The organic compounds peaks disappearance in the calcined zirconia nanoparticles reveals that the calcination has successfully removed the organic compounds from the as-prepared zirconia gel. Also, a new peak located at 490 cm -1 was attributed to Zr-O vibration. 3.1.4 XRD analysis The XRD pattern of as-synthesis zirconia nanoparticles that was prepared using zirconium salt to a rosemary extract 1:4 wt% calcined at 600 °C is shown in Fig. 6. According to this pattern, a cubic zirconia phase was obtained (JCPDS card number 27-0997). The crystallite size of ZrO2 nanoparticles is calculated using the Scherer formula [33]. The average crystallite size of the ZrO2 sample was approximately 16 nm."
7,ZrO2-PVA nanocomposite characterization,"3.2 ZrO2-PVA nanocomposite characterization 3.2.1 Mechanism of formation of ZrO2-PVA nanocomposite The first step of preparation of ZrO2-PVA nanocomposite was occurred by the dispersion of zirconia nanoparticles in the PVA media using ultrasonication method [34]. The next step is the hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups on the zirconia nanoparticles and the hydroxyl functional group of PVA molecules. The -OH group in PVA framework could have hydrogen interaction with the surface of zirconium oxide as filler. This hydrogen bonding could stabilize the nanocomposite and prohibited it from phase separation ( Fig. 7) [35]. 3.2.2 Mechanical measurements Fig. 8. Shows the strain-stress behavior of the pure PVA and PVA-ZrO2 nanocomposite films with different ZrO2 contents. A significant change in the stress-stress behavior of neat PVA is observed by the addition of the zirconia nanoparticles. Table 2 shows the tensile properties of as-prepared ZrO2-PVA nanocomposite as a function of zirconia content. The results show that tensile strength increased by addition of zirconia nanoparticles, particularly nanocomposite with 1 wt% of ZrO2 has a strength that is 2.4 times greater than the strength of the neat polymer. The improvement is mainly due to the reinforcement gained by the good dispersion of the ZrO2 NPs in the polymer matrix and their strong interaction and the good interface between the polymer matrix and ZrO2 NPs surface through hydrogen bonding [36]. As ZrO2 NPs is more increased the number of defects existing in the nanocomposite increased due to bubbles trapped during the sample preparation and weak interaction between the particles at high content [37]. The measured initial modulus of the pure PVA is about 169 MPa, but, nanocomposite film with 1 wt% zirconia reinforcement shows the elastic modulus 5.5 times higher than the pure matrix polymer. The reason for the observed properties is due to the high volume to surface ratio of the nanoparticles, as well as the good interface of PVA chains to zirconia surface. This binding allowed the force loading from the matrix to the zirconia nanoparticles and enhanced the elastic modulus. At high ZrO2 content, the stress field in the neighbor of the aggregate will be increased, causing in the easier crack initiation and propagation and decreased in the tensile module. The fracture toughness could be proportional to an area below the stress-strain curve. The fracture toughness value is a quantitate that shows the type of fracture [38]. The fracture toughness values slowly decreased by increasing the ZrO2 content indicate the features of nanocomposite change from ductile behavior to brittle one. As the polymer chains were immobilized on zirconia nanoparticles, these particles confined the movement of polymer chain resulting in a brittle behavior [39]. The elastic modulus and tensile properties value of some other prepared PVA base nanocomposite by various nanofiller has been shown in Table 3. It could be seen that the synthesized PVA/1 wt% ZrO2 NPs have proper mechanical properties as compared to other reported nanocomposites."
8,Conclusion,"Zirconia nanoparticles were green synthesized using rosemary extract as both template and stabilizer agents. The results showed that a sample of zirconium salt to rosemary extract 1: 4 wt. ٪ small-fine particles between 12 and 17 nm. These nanoparticles were selected and the effect of nanosized zirconia addition on the PVA polymer matrix was investigated. According to observations, the PVA elastic modulus increases with the addition of zirconia nanoparticles and decreases with increasing content of zirconia nanoparticles. The sample with 1 wt% ZrO2-PVA showed the best elastic modulus as compared to polymeric matrix."
