0,Introduction,"With the increase in the utilization of fossil fuels as a primary source of energy generation and its economic as well as environmental consequences, the production of green fuels has been the topic of much interest for quite a long time now. In light of the increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel depletion, many countries have focused on formulating environmentally friendly energy policies. Moreover, various research organizations have turned towards the development of such innovative systems that are capable of utilizing renewable sources for generating power and fuels. Of course, the choice of renewable energy has plenty to do with this research as each source, its availability and its capacity of power generation and fuel production vary in context of the energy demands which need to be met. Scientists and engineers across the globe have been making immense efforts to somehow exploit renewable energy sources most efficiently and economically for decades. However, various challenges need to be addressed to utilize these green energy sources. One of the fundamental amongst them is their intermittent availability. This inconsistency in the presence of such sources has been the greatest hurdle in the way of realizing the objective of a green economy. Having said that, amongst all renewable energy sources, the most compelling choice has always been the solar energy. Relative to other competing sources, solar energy has been the most promising option as far as its availability and the potential to produce energy. Around 30% of the solar energy which strikes the surface of the earth gets reflected and the remaining of that incident solar energy per year (3.9 × 1024 MJ) is approximately 10,000 times more compared with the global energy consumption at present (Joshi et al., 2011). This is an authentication to the aforementioned claim about the ability of solar energy for meeting the energy generation demands as well as fuel production. Solar fuels, such as hydrogen, have been a topic of much interest among the scientific community and there is plenty of literature available on various ways of solar hydrogen production. Hydrogen is not only utilized as a fuel itself but also helps in the generation of synthetic fuels, in production of ammonia and various fertilizers, in upgrading heavy oils such as oil sands and synthesis of other chemicals (Dincer, 2012). In light of these utilities of hydrogen, especially as fuel, several countries are trying to shift towards the hydrogen economy. According to Monica Nagashima Pereyaslovska, a researcher at the Institute of Energy Economics Japan (IEEJ), the Japanese government has dedicated nearly $1.5 billion over the last six to seven years towards technology R&D and subsidies for supporting the achievement of zero-emission low-cost hydrogen production through fossil fuels or renewable energy electrolysis, infrastructure development of import and domestic hydrogen distribution and scaling up hydrogen utilization across different sectors (Nagashima, 2018). Some of the European Horizon 2020 projects target at the development of solar thermochemical technology as a promising fuel production pathway at a large scale as well as competitive costs (“Sun-to-liquid project pr, 2019). Soon the whole world will eventually have to follow this line of action for meeting the ever-growing energy demands while preserving the environment at the same time. Numerous review articles are being published regarding solar hydrogen production in which various options have been discussed. Steinfeld (2014) discussed the solar thermochemical ways of hydrogen production. He reviewed the fundamental concepts and technological advancements in the domain of solar hydrogen production via concentrated solar energy serving as a source of providing high-temperature process heat. Moreover, he economically assessed several routes of solar thermochemical processes for producing hydrogen. According to his assessment, hydrogen generation by water electrolysis through solar-generated power can be competitive. Yadav and Banerjee (2016) performed a very comprehensive review that was aimed at the developments in the area of solar energy aided thermochemical processes based on experimental studies, cost, lifecycle, and thermodynamic analyses. Based on their analyses, they observed that thermochemical cycles had lower efficiencies and higher cost of hydrogen production than processes for solar upgrading. Moreover, they claimed that solar energy-based methane reforming and lime production methods showed greater experimental efficiencies in comparison with other solar thermochemical processes. Said et al. (2016) reviewed various solar reforming systems. They discussed the four variations of the reforming process namely, steam methane reforming (SMR), autothermal reforming, partial oxidation, and dry reforming. According to them, SMR using Nickel-based catalyst showed much promise with regards to cost-effectiveness and efficiency in hydrogen and synthesis gas (syngas) production when compared with other processes. Apart from SMR, they claimed that the rest of the reforming technologies were not suitable for producing hydrogen at bulk level. Moreover, they indicated in their review that solar energy was capable of providing the necessary heat required for the reforming process using facilities such as solar towers and parabolic dishes. Acar et al. (2016) reviewed various photocatalytic water-splitting approaches for hydrogen production where they analyzed photocatalysis as a green energy solution for addressing global climate change and environmental sustainability challenges. They comparatively assessed various photocatalysts available in the literature via visible light-based water splitting for hydrogen production based on quantum yield, bandgap, rate of producing hydrogen per unit mass of catalyst and rate of producing hydrogen per unit surface area of the catalyst. They reported that cadmium-sulfide based catalysts on average showed better performance characteristics for all assessment criteria except for quantum yield. On the other hand, zinc oxide/sulfide performed better as far as the quantum yield was concerned. Numerous studies related to various solar-driven hydrogen production methods have been performed and published in the open literature. Alzahrani and Dincer (2016) conducted a study in which they designed and analyzed an integrated system where a solar tower was utilized for harnessing thermal energy for high-temperature electrolysis to produce hydrogen. Their proposed system consisted of a solar tower and a thermal energy storage system with a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle and a high-temperature solid oxide steam electrolyzer (SOSE). Their study demonstrated that the integration of solar tower technology with high-temperature SOSE has great potential for hydrogen production. Moreover, the authors concluded that system optimization based on the thermal energy storage size could realize a continuous generation of hydrogen with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of around 12.7% which could rise to 56.8% if the heat provided to the thermal energy storage is taken into consideration. Hinkley et al. (2011) studied the prospects of a hybrid sulfur cycle (a hybrid-thermochemical cycle) solely based on solar operation in which thermal energy was supplied by concentrated solar energy and PV system was incorporated for providing the electrical input. Based on their study, they claimed that when it comes to large scale production of hydrogen, the hybrid sulfur cycle proves to be one of the prime candidates among the various thermochemical water-splitting cycles. Moreover, using sulfur-dioxide in the electrolyzer resulted in substantial electrical energy demand reduction in comparison with the orthodox alkaline process. One of their main conclusions was that using only solar energy for thermal and electrical energy input has the potential of zero emissions. Joshi et al. (2011) studied solar thermal and photovoltaic (PV) systems. They examined the performance of these systems based on energy and exergy analysis as well as the sustainability index. They rated the exergy efficiency of the solar collector as a significant factor for evaluating the solar thermal hydrogen generation system’s exergy efficiency because of its fluctuations with solar radiation intensity. Moreover, they concluded that the exergy efficiency of the PV panel also experienced variations with solar radiation intensity as well as ambient temperature. They further concluded that both these routes of solar hydrogen production were environmentally friendly and the systems’ energy efficiency was higher than their exergy efficiency. They further added that higher exergy efficiency of the systems ensured a higher sustainability index. In comparison between the two systems considered in their study, they reported the sustainability index of the solar thermal energy-based hydrogen production system to be higher than PV based hydrogen generation system since the former had a higher value of exergy efficiency than the later. Ozalp et al. (2018) conducted a study in which they assessed the viability of solar thermal cracking of natural gas as an alternate option for solar hydrogen production. They concluded that with the amalgamation of Hydrogen Fuel Cell (HFC) and Carbon Fuel Cell (CFC), solar natural gas cracking offers an encouraging alternative of conventional power generation cycles. Furthermore, they added that solar natural gas cracking for energy production through both CFC and HFC to charge the battery of an electric vehicle demonstrates way higher well-to-wheel efficiency in comparison with solar thermochemical cycles and solar reforming for syngas generation followed by a synthetic liquid fuel process. Acar and Dincer (2014) conducted a study in which they conceptually developed and performed thermodynamic analysis on a continuous type hybrid photoelectrochemical (PEC) system for hydrogen generation. The hybrid system consisted of PV panels with a PEC system and a dielectric mirror was placed such that it would allow a specific solar spectrum to the PEC cell for photocatalytic water-splitting and the part of the spectrum which could not be exploited for photocatalysis was sent to the PV panels for electricity generation which ultimately aided the electrolysis. During the presence of sunlight, the system took advantage of both photocatalysis as well as photoelectrolysis while when there was no sunlight, the system was only electricity dependent for producing H2 gas along with Cl2 gas and NaOH. One of the major advantages of the proposed system as reported by the authors was that it could effectively neutralize hydroxyl ions into useful commodities for industries. Moreover, by converting such by-products into NaOH and chlorine gas, the system enhanced its utility and efficiency. According to the literature review, various reviews regarding solar hydrogen production have been published. Most of those reviews were focused on particular pathways of generating solar-based hydrogen such as thermochemical, photocatalytic and fossil fuel reforming, etc. Some reviews were performed considering all renewable sources (including solar energy) for producing hydrogen. However, there has been no review available in the open literature focusing on all possible ways of exploiting solar energy for hydrogen production. Such a review and comparative evaluation is very essential for providing useful recommendations about future research directions for sustainable and environmentally friendly hydrogen production. This paper comprehensively reviews all routes of solar hydrogen production. The main objectives of this particular study are to (a) identify potential solar hydrogen production methods for application in various sectors, (b) categorize these potential methods for various applications and possibilities under various conditions, (c) discuss the challenges and opportunities as well as future directions of the considered methods, and (d) comparatively evaluate several solar energy-based hydrogen production processes based on two sets of criteria. Criteria set 1 include environmental impact and cost comparison while criteria set 2 include efficiency, sustainability index, and hydrogen production rate comparison. Methods assessed through criteria set 1 are: PV-electrolysis, photoelectrolysis, biophotolysis, photofermentation, high-temperature electrolysis, S–I, and Cu–Cl thermochemical water-splitting methods, fossil fuel reforming, biomass, and coal gasification processes. Methods evaluated through criteria set 2 are: solar thermal power generation and electrolysis, solar high-temperature electrolysis, solar water-splitting thermochemical and hybrid thermochemical cycles, photocatalytic or PEC process, biophotolysis, artificial photosynthesis, photofermentation, solar thermochemical H2S splitting, anaerobic digestion and solar thermal fossil fuel cracking. In the following section, we provide an overview of the various processes and available technologies of solar hydrogen production. Section 3 presents some of the novel techniques employed for generating hydrogen through solar energy. Section 4 discusses the factors which influence the cost of hydrogen production by considering plant data for various methods. In section 5, we comparatively evaluate the considered methods based on several factors. Section 6 provides a discussion regarding the potential of commercialization of the various processes of solar hydrogen production. In section 7, we briefly discuss some of the necessary global sustainability measures and efforts. Section 8 provides the conclusion of this paper."
1,Methods of solar hydrogen production,"Hydrogen production methods have been classified into four categories based on the option of solar energy being utilized as shown in Table 1 . These categories are listed as: (1) thermal energy-based methods (2) electrical energy-based methods (3) photonic energy-based methods and (4) hybrid options which include electrical with thermal energy, electrical with photonic energy, biochemical with thermal energy and biochemical with photonic energy-based methods. The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies of the various methods are also comparatively presented in Table 1. All the routes included in the thermal energy option utilizes the thermal potential of the solar irradiation entering the Earth’s atmosphere. As mentioned in the introduction section, the thermal energy of the sun can be exploited for various heat-driven processes without depleting fossil fuels and also avoiding the resulting GHG emissions. These thermal energy-based methods are further divided into two groups. The first group comprises of all those methods which utilize solar thermal energy for either water or hydrogen-sulfide splitting/cracking to produce hydrogen. The second group consists of those processes in which solar heat is employed for hydrogen production involving the utilization of fossil fuels. In electrical energy option, solar energy is first converted into electricity. This electricity is then supplied in an electrolyzer where water is electrochemically split into hydrogen and oxygen gases via electrolysis. The routes considered in the photonic energy option utilizes the photo-effect of the Sun which drives many light-dependent processes resulting in hydrogen production. Several methods fall under the category of hybrid options. Methods that use a combination of electrical and photonic energies work in a way that they utilize photonic energy for electrolysis by incorporating certain materials for electrodes that are photosensitive and undergo certain changes when a specific wavelength of sunlight falls upon them to eventually produce hydrogen. Electrical and thermal energies are used together where the process involves electrolysis as well as heat for either driving thermochemical reactions or a heat engine which converts a part of the provided thermal energy into mechanical work that is transformed into electricity and then supplied to an electrolyzer. The synergy of biochemical and thermal energies is realized such that biomass digestion is carried out through low-grade heat energy to produce hydrogen. Methods that use biochemical and photonic energies together work in various ways such as induction of microbes and bacteria for photo-generation, light assisted fermentation process and bio-imitation of natural photosynthesis for the generation of hydrogen. The various technological pathways undertaken for the solar energy exploitation routes for hydrogen production are summarized in Tables 2–4 . Table 2 presents the technologies in current use for realizing the thermal energy-based processes of hydrogen production. In Table 3, the available technological pathways are presented with respect to electrical and photonic energy routes. In Table 4, the technologies for exploiting several hybridized routes of solar energy are presented for hydrogen generation."
2,Novel techniques of producing solar based hydrogen,"Recently, there has been some very interesting research going on which is focused on novel approaches of producing hydrogen. Some of those techniques will be discussed in this section. Heremans et al. (2017) for the first time demonstrated a vapor-fed solar generator with KOH doped poly-vinyl-alcohol anion exchange membrane (AEM). The vapor-fed-based electrolysis device is coupled with silicon solar cells. In their system, lower current densities were generated (10 mA cm−2) resulting in low Ohmic losses in the electrolysis device under direct illumination. According to them, the water-vapor content in air is adequate for feeding such solar-based hydrogen generator with water molecules even through natural convection. The authors claim that their device and technique is capable of producing hydrogen with a STH efficiency of 15.1% over 1500 s at room temperature and a relative humidity of 95%. Along with better efficiency, their device is capable of producing hydrogen at a better cost since it employs earth-abundant catalysts. Segev et al. (2018) proposed a new category of devices classified as the hybrid photoelectrochemical and -voltaic cell (HPEV) for simultaneous direct production of hydrogen and electricity. The HPEV cell has the potential to avoid the issue of mismatched tandem component performance through the addition of a third electrical terminal at the bottom junction which allows photogenerated charge carriers, which are not consumed during the reaction, to get collected as electric current. As a consequence, electricity is generated simultaneously with hydrogen. Moreover, the amount of required output products between hydrogen and electricity can also be tuned/controlled i.e. when the demand for the electricity is high, the hydrogen output can be conveniently reduced to provide more supply of current to be harvested as electrical power. As per the authors’ claim, the proposed device has the promise of drastically augmenting the energy return on the supplied energy for PEC systems. Tembhurne et al. (2019) presented a concept in which a PEC device was operated using concentrated solar thermal energy for hydrogen production through thermal integration, optimization of mass transport and a close electronic integration between the electrocatalyst and the photo absorber. According to the authors, the proposed concept can achieve high current densities while simultaneously maintaining high energy conversion efficiency, which is a fundamental challenge that the PEC method faces to improve its competitiveness. An irradiation concentration of around 474 kW/m2 for attaining high current densities of up to 0.88 A/cm2 was used by the authors along with an efficient thermal management for ensuring better resistance towards degradation and high energy conversion efficiency. They employed active thermal management technique to facilitate conduction as well as forced convection for cooling the photo absorber and providing thermal energy to the catalytic sites to enhance the overall performance. Based on their study, they claim that this approach has the capacity of producing hydrogen at costs that seem to be competitive with those of traditional fuels thereby providing an encouraging route for a renewable hydrogen-based future."
3,Factors influencing the cost of hydrogen,"Various processes of solar hydrogen production using different solar energy sources have been discussed in this section. The data for production capacity, STH efficiency and cost of hydrogen is taken from reference (El-Emam and Özcan, 2019) and presented in Table 5 . From the table, we can see the two fundamental factors which have been observed to influence the cost of hydrogen production i.e. plant production capacity and solar technology incorporated. The higher the capacity, the lower was the cost. Among all the processes considered herein, overall, the hybrid sulfur thermochemical water-splitting method produces the most cost-effective hydrogen while the algal method, which is a hybrid (biochemical and photonic) method, results in the most expensive hydrogen. Even though, the concentrated solar thermal energy-based considered HyS plant had smaller capacity, it resulted in lower hydrogen production cost. Moreover, for other routes as well, when concentrated solar thermal energy was employed for providing heat like in high-temperature steam electrolysis, the hydrogen production cost was minimum. Furthermore, when considering the systems using the same sources, the plants having higher production capacity demonstrated to have lower hydrogen costs per kg."
4,Comparative evaluation of methods,"The comparative evaluation is performed using two sets of criteria. Criteria set 1 comprises of cost and environmental impact comparisons. Criteria set 2 consists of exergy and energy efficiencies, sustainability indices and rates of hydrogen production comparisons. The methods included for comparative evaluation in criteria set 1 are PV-electrolysis, photoelectrolysis, biophotolysis, photofermentation, steam or high-temperature electrolysis, S–I thermochemical cycle, Cu–Cl thermochemical cycle, fossil fuel reforming, biomass, and coal gasification processes. In criteria set 1, the thermochemical, reforming and gasification processes discussed are not solar-based due to lack of data availability of these methods. However, the data gives an insight into how these values would vary if these routes are solar energy driven. The methods selected for comparative evaluation in criteria set 2 are PV-electrolysis, solar thermal power generation and electrolysis, solar steam or high-temperature electrolysis, solar water-splitting thermochemical and hybrid thermochemical cycles, photocatalytic or PEC method, biophotolysis, artificial photosynthesis, photofermentation, solar thermochemical H2S splitting, anaerobic digestion and solar thermal cracking of fossil fuels."
5,Environmental impact and cost comparison,"5.1 Environmental impact and cost comparison CO2 emissions, due to their deleterious environmental impact, are considered the most fundamental of the GHGs and their minimization is an issue that is supposed to be addressed by the future energy carrier (Dincer and Acar, 2014). Methods such as CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) or utilization of the carbon dioxide as a commodity or waste in any industrial process have been widely known to manage the GHGs in an effective way (Acar and Dincer, 2015). The Global warming potential (GWP) and acidification potential (AP) are the selected environmental impact categories according to the operational guide of the ISO standards to define the Life cycle assessments (LCA) procedures (JB, 2001). GWP is the measure of CO2 emissions and AP represents the SO2 discharge on soil and into water (Ozbilen et al., 2011). In criteria set 1, the AP and GWP LCA results presented in (Bhandari et al., 2014) and (Ozbilen et al., 2013) are utilized as the foundation of comparing environmental impact. Among the various methods considered, fossil fuel reforming, coal, and biomass gasification are the three hydrogen production processes with the highest AP and GWP while biophotolysis, photoelectrolysis and photofermentation exhibit the lowest GWP and AP based on the data reported in references (Bhandari et al., 2014) and (Ozbilen et al., 2013). Thus, it can be concluded that photonic energy-based methods are the most environmentally benign processes to generate solar hydrogen. On the contrary, gasification, and fossil fuel-based methods are of more harm to the environment. As stated previously, the data considered for reforming, thermochemical and gasification processes are not solar-based due to limited data availability. However, if solar energy is utilized for supplying the required process heat, the environmental impact of the reforming and gasification processes will significantly reduce. With regards to the production cost of hydrogen, there are always certain ambiguities and uncertainties associated as it is influenced by various parameters and factors such as the cost of feedstock to be used as an input, the advancement or maturity level of the production technology and the availability of current infrastructure (Acar and Dincer, 2015). Based on the data presented in Table 6 , coal and biomass gasification, S–I and Cu–Cl thermochemical cycles and biophotolysis are the most economical methods of producing hydrogen whereas PV-, photo- and high-temperature electrolysis are the most expensive routes of solar hydrogen production. As future work, plenty of research is required for bringing down the cost of hydrogen through water electrolysis with respect to the exploitation of solar PV/T. The cost of material (PV cells and electrolyzer), installation and maintenance all contribute towards the overall cost for generating hydrogen."
6,"Efficiency, sustainability index, and production capacity comparison","5.2 Efficiency, sustainability index, and production capacity comparison This section compares and discusses the energy and exergy efficiencies, sustainability indices and capacities of hydrogen production of the various methods considered in criteria set 2. Efficiency, as defined in reference (Dincer and Acar, 2014), is the beneficial output by consumed input. The following equation is used to express the energy efficiency of a hydrogen generation process: (19) η = m ˙ L H V E ˙ i n where m ˙ represents the mass flow rate of hydrogen produced, LHV abbreviates the lower heating value of hydrogen which is 121 MJ/kg and E ˙ i n is the input energy rate. Similarly, the exergy efficiency is represented by the following equation: (20) ψ = m ˙ e x c h E x ˙ i n where e x c h is the chemical exergy of hydrogen and E x ˙ i n is the input exergy rate. Based on the data presented in reference (Dincer and Zamfirescu, 2012), amongst the methods selected for criteria set 2, solar thermal energy-based water-splitting thermochemical cycles, hybrid thermochemical cycles and solar fossil fuel cracking show the highest exergy and energy efficiencies. On the other hand, PEC or photocatalytic methods are the least efficient methods of hydrogen production. The sustainability index (SI) is used for determining the sustainability of the considered routes of solar hydrogen production based on exergy efficiency and is defined as: (21) S I = 1 − ψ The data used for exergy efficiencies (based on reference (Dincer and Zamfirescu, 2012)) are used here for comparison of the SI. According to the data, processes having higher exergy efficiencies result in lower SI values. Amongst the methods considered, photocatalysis or PEC and PV-electrolysis have the highest SI values whereas, solar thermochemical and hybrid thermochemical cycles exhibit the lowest SI values. The hydrogen production capacities in MW for various methods considered in criteria set 2 are based on the data reported in reference (Dincer and Zamfirescu, 2012). According to the data, methods that utilize the solar thermal energy results in a much higher yield (except for solar cracking) in comparison to the photonic energy and biochemical energy-based methods, which have extremely low rates of hydrogen production due to their lower STH conversion efficiencies. Amongst the solar thermal-based methods, thermochemical water-splitting processes stand out as they have the highest hydrogen production capacities. The solar HTSE also exhibits high production capacities as well as solar thermal power generation and electrolysis. With further efforts, these values have the potential to jump further up as well. Overall, the processes which utilize high thermal energy demonstrate higher efficiencies in producing hydrogen in comparison with the low-temperature methods. The photonic and biochemical methods of hydrogen production are more sustainable but have lower efficiencies. Moreover, the solar thermal methods are more suitable for hydrogen production at higher capacities since they have much higher yields of hydrogen. Plenty of research is required for increasing the yield of these low temperature photonic and biochemical processes."
7,Commercialization potential in the near future,"In this section, we will discuss about the current stage of technological development of various solar based hydrogen production processes and the potential of their commercialization in the coming future. Various factors play their part when it comes to the commercialization of sustainable energy sources among which the globally implemented energy policies play a vital role. Over the past decade, sustainability and environmental preservation have moved up the priority list in the context of policy formulation among the developed countries. Such policies help in regulating the costs associated with the commercial implementation of these sustainable energy sources such as hydrogen. Another important factor is the technological and infrastructural readiness and process efficiencies of such systems having the potential and promise of replacing conventional methods. As discussed in the earlier sections of this paper, some of the methods of solar hydrogen production are more efficient (thermochemical cycles, HTSE, etc.), some are more environmentally friendly (artificial photosynthesis, photocatalysis, etc.) and some are more cost-effective (reforming, gasification, etc.). Photonic energy-based routes are the most environmentally benign ways of producing hydrogen however, they have lower production rates and conversion efficiencies which is why they are not a feasible option to be implemented for commercial purposes as of now and in the near future. However, among all photonic routes, PV electrolysis is a method having much higher STH efficiency and is technologically mature as well. If the cost of the material associated with this method is regulated properly, it can be commercialized soon for production at higher capacities. Within the methods exploiting solar thermal energy, solar and hybrid thermochemical water-splitting processes have the most potential of commercialization readiness. They have been studied extensively in the open literature. They have higher energy (38%) and exergy (35%) efficiencies as well as better STH efficiencies (18%), better SI values (0.65) and can produce hydrogen at capacities ranging between 75 and 400 MW. Since this method has relatively lower thermal energy requirements, the material selection and cost are also not a big constraint in its commercialization. Moreover, a wide range of solar thermal options can be considered for exploiting heat energy. However, material, installation and maintenance cost of components associated with harnessing solar thermal energy may result in increasing the cost of per kg hydrogen produced. Hence, the regulation of all these costs is an essential part of commercializing solar thermochemical processes. SMR, as mentioned earlier, is the most commonly utilized method of hydrogen production industrially since it produces hydrogen at higher efficiencies and capacities. At the same time, its increased rate of methane utilization for providing process heat and as a feedstock makes it a non-sustainable and non-environment friendly method of producing hydrogen. However, modification in this process by using concentrated solar thermal energy instead of methane combustion can certainly make this method more sustainable and environmentally benign than its conventional version. Solar driven HTSE has also demonstrated technological maturity and commercialization potential based on various investigations in open literature and data provided in Table 5. Due to its higher STH efficiency and lower electrical power consumption, it is one of the most promising green methods of hydrogen production and a prime candidate for large scale commercial implementation."
8,Global sustainability measures,"Each of the methods considered for solar hydrogen production in this study possesses the capability of contributing towards achieving sustainability through the generation of hydrogen as a sustainable and cleaner fuel. However, other measures for sustainable development are also required to be taken in this regard. According to reference (“The future of hydrogen:, 2019), the cost of hydrogen production using electricity from renewables (including solar energy) could reduce by around 30% by 2030 due to the cost declination of renewables. Components such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, and refueling kits could benefit if manufactured in bulk. As one of the leading options for energy storage, hydrogen has the potential to become a low-cost pathway of storing electric power for longer durations. This potential of hydrogen could be exploited only through collaborative global efforts for ensuring the convenient transportation of hydrogen (as a fuel) from regions of abundant solar resources to energy scarce parts of the world. Moreover, the price of hydrogen for consumers is a function of hydrogen delivery per day and its utilization frequency. Regulating its price would require long term planning and strong collaborations between industry, investors, and governments to present hydrogen as an attractive alternate fuel for consumers to ensure sustainability. Furthermore, the implementation of effective global carbon taxing could greatly reduce GHG emissions (Metcalf, 2019) and could help support the cause of achieving sustainability on a large scale. Some useful recommendations for scaling up hydrogen according to reference (“The future of hydrogen:, 2019) include establishing the role of hydrogen in long-term energy policies and strategies, stimulating commercial demand of green hydrogen, supporting R&D for bringing down costs and eliminating redundant regulatory hurdles."
9,Conclusions,"This review discusses the different options and routes of solar hydrogen production. Some literature review has been presented with their key results, conclusions, and recommendations. Several methods and routes of solar hydrogen production are presented along with the available technologies for their realization. Moreover, some novel techniques and recent advances in solar-based hydrogen generation are presented. We also discussed some plant configurations taking various ways of harnessing solar energy as well as different routes. A couple of factors that seem to influence the cost of hydrogen production are the plant capacity to generate hydrogen and the solar technology incorporated for supplying either thermal, electrical or photonic energy. Based on the data and configurations considered, the hybrid sulfur thermochemical water-splitting cycle stands out as the most cost-effective methodology of obtaining hydrogen by employing concentrated solar thermal energy. The prime objective of this review is to comparatively evaluate the various processes of solar hydrogen production. Two sets of criteria have been considered for evaluating those methods. Criteria set 1 include environmental impact and cost of production. Criteria set 2 include exergy and energy efficiencies, sustainability index and hydrogen production rate. The methods selected for criteria set 1 and 2 are different based on the available data. According to the overall comparison of criteria set 1, photonic energy-based methods and thermochemical Cu–Cl and S–I water splitting cycles are the most environmentally benign (GWP ranging between 0.4 and 2 kg CO2/kg H2 and AP ranging between 0.8 and 2.5 g SO2/kg H2) whereas coal gasification is the most cost-effective. However, if coal gasification is provided solar thermal energy as heat input, its cost-effectiveness and environmental impact could improve much more. Moreover, high-temperature processes have a more detrimental effect on the environment due to higher GHG emissions. From the overall comparison of criteria set 2, high thermal energy-consuming processes are more energetically and exergetically efficient, however, at the same time, less sustainable in comparison to the lower efficiency photonic and biochemical energy-based processes. Furthermore, solar thermal routes of hydrogen production are more suited for large scale production due to their higher hydrogen production rates. As a recommendation for future work, further investigations with regards to solar-based SMR, solar biomass gasification and solar coal gasification systems need to be performed along with cost analysis so that realistic data can help compare these processes with and without solar thermal energy. This would help in a more accurate comparative evaluation of these methods based on the overall cost, capacity, and efficiencies of hydrogen production of such systems employing solar energy."
