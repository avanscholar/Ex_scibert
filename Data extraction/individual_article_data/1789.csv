0,Introduction,"Nowadays, hydrogen is being considered as a strategic fuel to be used in fuel cells. These cells could replace the current combustion engines in which diesel and gasoline are utilized as fuel. Hydrogen cannot be considered as a renewable fuel since it has to be obtained from other primary energy sources. So, the development of procedures for its obtaining is deserving much effort [1–3]. At present, two major technologies are being used to produce this fuel at large scale: the catalytic route through the water gas shift reaction and the electrolytic decomposition of water [4,5]. Plasma technology is very promising for hydrogen production from methane, ethanol and hydrocarbon conversions. Plasma processes combine high chemical reactivity with low operational cost, and appear as an interesting alternative to the conventional methods named above. Among different plasma types, non-thermal plasmas are considered the most effective medium for this purpose because the electron temperature (energy) is higher than the gas temperature (of heavy plasma particles) and the energy supplied to the plasma is not used to heat discharge particles. This non-equilibrium property results in lower power requirements for creating and maintaining the discharge and increase the plasma capability to induce physical and chemical reactions within gases at relatively low temperatures [6]. Surface wave discharges (SWDs) generated at atmospheric pressure are a special kind of microwave plasmas [7]. These discharges are non-thermal plasmas and offer several advantages over microwave discharges such as a) the lower power required to obtain similar values of electron density and electron temperature, b) high stability and reproducibility within a wide range of experimental conditions, c) large plasma volume from the excited region, which is directly related to the power supplied to the plasma, and d) enough residence time to break down the bonds of the molecules introduced into these discharges. Moreover, the generation of them at atmospheric pressure simplifies implementation on an industrial scale which is just the opposite of what happens with discharges at reduced pressure. In a previous work, the capability of SWDs at atmospheric pressure to produce the decomposition of various alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol) in order to obtain molecular hydrogen was studied [8]. In such a work, a method called bubbling was employed to introduce the alcohols into the plasma. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was utilized to know at real-time the species formed from the alcohols without disturbing the plasma. It was observed that the plasma broke the chemical bonds of alcohol molecules thus leading to the appearance of emission molecular bands corresponding to C2 and CH species. Besides, an increase in the intensities of both the OH radical band and the Hα hydrogen line when alcohols were introduced into the plasma was also detected. Here, we present a specific study on the ethanol decomposition by a surface wave plasma at atmospheric pressure for obtaining molecular hydrogen at the discharge exit. Among the four alcohols studied in [8], ethanol was chosen because it can be obtained by fermentation of starch, sugar and crop wastes. The plasma was a gas mixture of argon and ethanol. The influence of the Ar flow for a constant amount (g/h) of alcohol on produced H2 was analyzed. The success of both the dissociation and excitation processes of molecules by the plasma particles depends on the electron density and the energy available in the discharge. This energy is mainly provided in the form of the kinetic energy of plasma particles (electrons and heavy species). OES techniques were used to determine two plasma parameters-gas temperature and electron density-, which are considered the key features to induce the internal chemistry reactions in non-equilibrium plasmas. Furthermore, a discussion on the chemistry during ethanol decomposition by the plasma is also presented."
1,Experimental-setup,
2,Plasma system,"2.1 Plasma system The experimental setup used for the plasma generation is shown in Fig. 1 . Microwave power from a 2.45 GHz SAIREM microwave generator (GMP 03k/SM) was supplied for plasma creation in continuous mode and a surfatron [9] was used as the energy coupler device [10]. The incident power utilized to create and maintain the plasma was of 200 W. A triple stub impedance matching was used to minimize the power reflected from the applicator back to the generator. This reflected power was less than 5% of the incident power. Argon gas (purity ≥ 99.999%) flows of 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25 and 1.50 L/min were used for generation of plasmas created in a quartz tube of 1.5 mm and 4 mm inner and outer diameter, respectively. Straight after plasma ignition with the Ar gas, an ethanol flow of 0.22 g/h was added to the plasma by using a gas-phase liquid delivery system (CEM system from Bronkhorst). Unlike the bubbling system, in which argon was bubbled through ethanol thus resulting in the saturation of the gas in the reactant, CEM system allows a more precise control of ethanol concentration. The bubbler system requires optimum pressure and temperature control and the response time and the absolute accuracy are low. Moreover, it exhibits poor long term stability. On the contrary, in the CEM system, the chosen concentration of ethanol is mixed with the carrier gas and vaporized in some seconds with high accuracy and repeatability. The flow values were chosen considering both the small dimensions of the tube in which the plasma was generated and the ethanol amount that was introduced into the plasma. The ethanol vapor/argon mixture was led to the plasma through a steel tube heated at 110 °C to maintain its temperature over the ethanol boiling point so as to avoid alcohol condensation which could produce plasma extinction. Due to the plasma high temperature, the quartz tube was externally refrigerated by an air flow from a high-pressure air tank at room temperature."
3,Analysis techniques,"2.2 Analysis techniques Two types of analyses were carried out. On the one hand, the plasma capability of inducing the decomposition of ethanol molecules was analyzed through the radiation emitted by the plasma. This radiation was collected perpendicularly to the discharge tube at 2 cm of the end of the plasma column (in all cases) by a PCS 1000 optical fiber with a silicon core of 1000 ± 40 μm diameter and guided to the entry slit of a Czerny-Turner monochromator (Jobin-Yvon Horiba) with 650 cm of focal distance and holographic gratings of 1200 and 2400 lines/mm. A Hamamatsu R928P photomultiplier (PMT) and a Symphony charge-coupled device (CCD) were used as the radiation detectors. Recorded spectra allowed us to gain information about the different species existing in the plasma and to estimate the gas temperature (CCD camera) and the electron density (PMT) in the discharge. On the other hand, a quadrupole mass spectrometer (PT M63 112, mod. Omnistar) was placed on line to the discharge tube to detect the produced molecular hydrogen. In order to prevent potential solid by-products from entering into the mass spectrometer, a 45 cm3 basket type filter (retention of particles ≥0.1 μm and a efficiency of 99%, with a maximum operating temperature of 200 °C, re. 33127-201 from Iberfluid, Spain) was placed at the exit of the discharge tube (see Fig. 1)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Plasma morphology,"3.1 Plasma morphology The introduction of ethanol in argon SWD induces changes in the plasma morphology as evidenced by the length reduction of the plasma column and the color change of the light emitted by the plasma. Fig. 2 shows pictures of plasmas generated at different Ar flows before (Fig. 2a–e) and after (Fig. 2f–j) the entrance of alcohol into the plasma. As can be seen, addition of alcohol to the gas results in a shortening of plasma length more evident for low Ar flows (plasma lengths of 3.4 cm and 1.8 cm for 1.25 and 0.50 L/min, respectively). On the contrary, pure Ar plasma lengths remain constant (ca. 9 cm) irrespective of the flow. The axial variation of electron density along the plasma column constitutes a specific characteristic of a surface wave plasma. This parameter decreases from the position next to the energy coupler device up to the end of the plasma column, where electron density reaches a specific value (critical density) below which plasma cannot exist. Thus, there is no plasma beyond this point and plasma length is determined. Shortening observed in ethanol-argon plasma columns is due to collision of the electrons belonging to the bulk of the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) not only with the atoms of the Ar gas but also with alcohol molecules, thus producing dissociation/excitation processes in these molecules [11]. Therefore, the stepwise formation of free electrons in the plasma from Ar atom decreases, critical density is reached in positions closer to the energy coupler device (surfatron) and the argon-ethanol plasma reaches a lower length than pure Ar plasma. Moreover, pure-Ar and Ar-ethanol plasmas can be observed to differ in color. Ar plasma is nearly white, as Ar emission lines are distributed within the visible spectrum. On the other hand, Ar-ethanol plasma is green and its emission is mainly located within a specific region (see next section)."
6,Plasma parameters: gas temperature and electron density,"3.2 Plasma parameters: gas temperature and electron density Radical-controlled plasma processing combined with in situ monitoring are a key technology to realize industrial plasma applications. In this sense, process optimization requires the measurement of some plasma internal parameters. In this particular case, in order to understand the processes in the plasma leading to ethanol decomposition and hydrogen generation at the discharge exit, gas temperature and electron density in the plasma were measured. The gas temperature is a measure of the energy of the heavy plasma particles which can participate in the excitation process of the radicals generated into the plasma. So, this temperature is considered a key parameter in the decomposition processes of substances for generation of molecular hydrogen [12,13]. As for the electrons, they are the particles that control the reactions in plasmas at atmospheric pressure [14,15]. They are responsible for the first step of the decomposition processes through the production of reactive species in the discharge via different types of collisions with the gas atoms and molecules [16]. The gas temperature in plasmas is usually measured from the Boltzmann-plot method applied to the relative intensity distribution in the rotational spectrum for molecular species in the discharge such as OH species [14,17], N2 + [18], CN [19] and C2 [20]. In plasmas under atmospheric pressure condition, the exchange between the translational energy of molecules and their internal ro-vibrational states is very efficient [21]. Therefore, in this case, the rotational temperature (T rot ) determined from the Boltzmann-plot can be considered equal to the gas temperature (T gas ). Molecular C2 and OH bands were observed in the spectra (see Section 3.3). However, the intensity of the OH band was too weak in comparison to the C2 Swan band system as to enable sensitive measurements of the rotational distribution, and hence of the gas temperature. Thus the C2 (0,0) Swan band at 516.5 nm, which does not overlap with any other rotational bands, was chosen. The C2 lines utilized are shown in Table 1 and rotational temperature was calculated from the following equation [18]: (1) log ( I A ) = − 1.090 T r o t B + C o n s t Fig. 3 shows the C2 spectrum registered for Ar flow of 0.75 L/min and 0.22 g/h of ethanol in the mixture whereas Fig. 4 depicts the corresponding Boltzmann-plot. The variation of the gas temperature with the Ar flow in the argon-ethanol mixture is shown in Fig. 5 . As can be observed, the gas temperature tends to decrease as the Ar flow increases from 0.50 to 1.25 L/min. The Stark broadening of the Hβ line (ΔλS(Hβ)) is the most frequently used Balmer series line to measure electron density (n e ) due to the negligible dependence of its Stark broadening on electron temperature (T e ) and the slight and negligible effect of the ionic dynamic phenomena on its profile [22]. Unfortunately, it is not always detectable, as it is the case under the experimental conditions of the present piece of research. For this reason it is necessary to calculate n e value from the Stark broadening of Hα line (ΔλS(Hα)). For this purpose two possible spectroscopic methods can be used: (i) the Gigosos and Cardeñoso computational model [23] and (ii) the so-called ΔλS(Hα)–ΔλS(Hβ) calibration method [24].Gigosos and Cardeñoso [23] proposed a computational model, which use a Lagrange twofold-entry interpolation to calculate n e from the Stark broadening of the Hα line (ΔλS(Hα)) and the electron temperature, including the effect of the ionic dynamic phenomena. On the other hand, the indirect ΔλS(Hα)–ΔλS(Hβ) calibration method is a simple way to obtain n e without the knowledge of electron temperature value taking into account the effect of ionic dynamics on the Hα profile. In this sense, from ΔλS(Hα) broadening, the corresponding ΔλS(Hβ) width can be obtained from the calibration curve given by [24] and the electron density value is derived from the expression that appears in [25]. In plasmas at atmospheric pressure the spectral profiles can be approximated to a Voigt function resulting from the convolution of both, Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles. So, a deconvolution process (based on Lavenberg-Marquardt non linear fitting algorithm for minimum squares) was used to obtain the Lorentzian width of the Hα line. Estimations showed that resonance and natural broadening were negligible under the used operation conditions and, consequently, the Lorentzian width of the profile could be considered as a contribution of the Stark and the van der Waals effects. The measured gas temperature was used to estimate van der Waals width and it was substrated from the Lorentzian broadening of the Hα line in order to get its Stark broadening [26]. The values of the electron density from the two procedures described above were approximately equal to 1.4 × 1015 cm-3 for all Ar flows considered in the current study."
7,Ethanol decomposition,"3.3 Ethanol decomposition Two examples of the optical emission spectra of an Ar pure plasma and an Ar-ethanol plasma are given in Fig. 6 a and b, respectively. In both cases, the Ar flow was 0.75 L/min. In Fig. 6a, the emission lines of ArI system corresponding to 4p, 5p and the higher excited levels can be seen. The strong emission around 700 nm is related to the characteristic violet color of the Ar plasmas. When alcohol molecules were introduced into the plasma, emitted spectrum was that presented in Fig. 6b. There was a strong emission from C2 molecules corresponding to Swan system (A3Πg → X3Πu) with band-heads at 436.5, 473.7, 516.5, 563.5 and 612.2 nm, located within the spectrum's green region, thus in agreement with the color shown by plasma and the Deslandres-D’Azambuja system (339.8, 360.7 and 385.2 nm, c3Πg → b1Πu) which appears in alcohol-containing discharges. Other molecular species such as CH (314.3 nm system, C2Σ+ → X2Π) together with an increase in the OH (306.4 nm system, A2Σ+ → X2Π) band intensity when alcohol is present in the discharge were also detected. Moreover, other atomic species such as C I, H I (Hα line) and O I were observed. The hydrogen Fulcher band emitting in the 560–640 nm interval, corresponding to the hydrogen molecule (H2) at the excited level, was not observed under our experimental conditions. Comparing Fig. 6a and b, the CH and C2 bands only appear if the alcohol is introduced into the discharge which indicates the existence of dissociation reactions of the ethanol molecules. Furthermore, the intensity of the Hα line, corresponding to atomic hydrogen, increases after the ethanol introduction; this also implies that atomic hydrogen production occurred through the decomposition of ethanol molecules. Fig. 6b also shows the emission of ArI lines corresponding to 4p and 4p’ levels while the higher levels (≥5p) were not detected. In plasmas at atmospheric pressure, the upper levels (≥5p) are mainly populated by electrons of low energies (≈4–5 eV) from the Ar metastable levels [27]; besides, the energy of the C–H and C–C bonds are 4.3 and 3.6 eV, respectively. This suggests that a great number of electrons collide with ethanol molecules instead of Ar atoms inducing the dissociation of ethanol molecules and providing excited-states of the formed radicals. Consequently, the populations of Ar upper levels (≥5p) are not high enough as to be detected in the spectrum. Table 2 and Table 3 summarize, respectively, the band heads of the molecular and the atomic species which were observed in the emission spectra for discharges generated with the Ar flows utilized in the current work. For a possible industrial application of the procedure described for hydrogen production, it is important to make sure that plasma is stable with time in order to ensure that, in turn, decomposition of ethanol and, consequently, hydrogen production are as constant as possible. In this sense, plasma emission spectra were registered at different time intervals through the 200–950 nm range. As shown in Fig. 6b, the main species detected were in all cases C2, Hα and atomic Ar. Fig. 7 shows the evolution of intensities of C2 band-head corresponding to (0,0) transition in Swan system, hydrogen Hα line at 656.3 nm and atomic Ar at 696.5 nm for an Ar flow of 0.75 L/min. Furthermore, Fig. 8 represents the calculations of gas temperature and electron density in the same time interval considered in Fig. 7. These results reflect a non-modification of the generated species from the ethanol decomposition in the plasma with time, which is related to the stability of decomposition/excitation kinetics of ethanol molecules by the plasma species."
8,Products at the plasma exit: hydrogen production,"3.4 Products at the plasma exit: hydrogen production In order to identify the main gaseous products obtained at the discharge exit after ethanol decomposition, a mass spectrometer was utilized (See Section 2.2). 2 mL/min of the gas exhaust stream coming from the ethanol pyrolisis inside the plasma was extracted directly for on-line gas analysis and frequent peaks from 0 to 100 a.m.u. were recorded. Fig. 9 shows a typical mass spectrum in the 0–100 a.m.u. range before and after switching on the Ar-ethanol plasma, for an Ar flow of 0.75 L/min whereas Fig. 10 represents a zoom of some selected regions. The most abundant peaks correspond to Ar+ and Ar++ (with m/z 40 and 20, respectively). Moreover, Ar isotopes with m/z 36 and 38 are also evident. Fig. 11 shows the NIST electron impact spectra (70 eV) corresponding to some of the products which could be formed in the plasma. As can be seen (Figs. 9 and 10d), switching on the plasma results in the complete disappearance of ethanol (100% conversion) as evidenced by the sharp decrease in m/z 31, the base peak of ethanol corresponding to hydroxymethyl cation, +CH2OH. The reactant is mainly transformed into molecular hydrogen (m/z 2), carbon monoxide (m/z 28) and acetylene (m/z 26). One could think of the possibility of ethane contributing to m/z 28. However, 28/29 relative intensities ratios (Fig. 10c) are quite close to 100/1.2 typical of CO whereas for ethane they should be ca. 100/21 (see Fig. 11f). Furthermore, the low intensity of m/z 29 and m/z 27 allow us to rule out the formation of acetaldehyde or ethylene, respectively (compare Fig. 10c with 11 g and 11 h). As regards the peak of m/z 26, it can be ascribed to acetylene. In fact, intensity of m/z 26/25/24 follows a typical 100/20/5 ratio (Figs. 10c and 11c). Relative intensities of m/z 16 and m/z 15 also suggest the presence of methane at trace levels. Similarly, traces of diacetylene (m/z 50), benzene or 2,4-hexadiyne (C6H6, m/z 78) and C6H2 species (m/z 74) are also present (see general mass spectrum in Fig. 9 and zoom in Fig. 10d and e). Water signal (m/z 18) does not change much with the switching on of the plasma (Fig. 10b). Finally, some carbon deposits were obtained in the filter placed before the mass spectrometer probe. The study was then extended to other Ar flows in the 0.50–1.50 L/min range. Mass spectra from 0 to 100 a.m.u. were registered in all cases (not shown). Results confirmed full conversion of ethanol in the whole flow range and suggested that increasing Ar flow resulted in a progressive decrease in hydrogen production, whereas carbon monoxide remained constant. As regards acetylene and methane, they presented and opposite trend: acetylene decreased whereas methane increased with increasing Ar flows. Finally, higher Ar flows led to a decrease in peaks appearing at m/z 50 and m/z 78 whereas m/z 18, assigned to water evolution, remained constant. Specific characteristics of microwave plasmas at atmospheric pressure could account for the limited extent of formation of large molecules. It is well known that the use of this plasma type yields small and simple molecules. This feature results from the large number of electrons (≈1015 cm−3 in our case) colliding with heavy particles which contributes to break molecules thus limiting the size of by-products. In order to better quantify the main gaseous reaction products (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, acetylene and methane) their corresponding m/z ratios (2, 28, 26 and 16) were monitored while keeping the different Ar flows constant for ca. 70min each (Fig. 12 ). Moreover, for each Ar flow carbon deposits were recovered from the filter and weighted. From Fig. 12 it is evident that evolution of the gaseous products is quite stable for the same Ar flow. This is consistent with the plasma stability observed from the constant intensities registered for C2, Hα and Ar species (Fig. 7). Consideration of the corresponding response factors allowed us to calculate the molar production (mmol/h) of each chemical as well as their volumetric composition in the carrier gas (Ar) (Fig. 13 ). Fig. 13a confirms that unlike methane, hydrogen and acetylene production as well as carbon deposits decrease as Ar flow increases, especially for Ar flows over 1.00 L/min. For the two extreme Ar gas flows (0.50 and 1.50 L/min), stoichiometry of the reaction can be expressed as (2) C2H5OH → 2.5H2 + CO + 0.40C2H2 + 0.05 CH4 + 0.15 C Ar flow = 1.50 L / min (3) C2H5OH → 2.1H2 + CO + 0.35C2H2 + 0.275 CH4 + 0.025 C Ar flow = 0.50 L / min These results suggest that ethanol conversion proceeds through two main reactions (4) C2H5OH → 2.5H2 + CO + 0.5C2H2 (5) C2H5OH → H2 + CO + CH4 No steam reforming seems to exist under our experimental conditions since as stated above, m/z 18, associated to water, does not change as the reaction proceeds at the diverse Ar flows. This suggests that water content detected by mass spectrometry correspond to some humidity in the system. Apparently, reaction (4) is the main process throughout the whole Ar flow range, though for high flows (i.e. lower residence times) process (5) becomes more important, thus resulting in the increase in CH4 production at the expense of both acetylene and hydrogen. In fact there is an inverse linear relationship between methane and acetylene (Fig. 14 a). The possibility of a transformation of methane into acetylene at low flows (i.e. higher temperatures in the plasma) cannot be ruled out. Therefore, modification of the methane/acetylene ratios with the Ar flow could be partly interpreted in terms of stability of both chemicals at the different plasma temperatures [12]. In fact, Fincke et al. [13] studied the plasma thermal conversion of methane to acetylene finding that for temperatures ca. in the 2000–3500 °C range such a process is favored whereas higher temperatures favor carbon gas production. In our case, as shown in Fig. 5 plasma gas temperatures for the different working flows were below 3000 °C except for experiments at 0.5 L/min in which case ca. 3500 °C was reached. This could explain that even though carbon formation increases as Ar flow becomes lower (as a result of higher plasma temperatures) such an increase is particularly significant when passing from 0.75 to 0.50 L/min resulting in carbon production being doubled (0.33 mmol/h and 0.65 mmol/h, respectively, Fig. 13a). Carbon could also be formed directly through the process: (6) C2H5OH → C + CO + 3H2 which has been described to occur in ethanol plasmas[28,29]. In fact C2 bands were clearly evident in Fig. 6b. It is also possible that carbon deposits have some soot contribution. Two main routes have been described in the literature for soot formation in the combustion and thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons: the acetylene route (whose thermodynamic stability as well as that of higher polymers C2nH2 increases with increasing temperature) and the aromatic route (which considers that primary soot particles are the result of the coagulation of bulky polycyclic aromatic molecules). Detection of acetylene, diacetylene (its primary intermediate [29,30], Fig. 14b) and traces of C6H2 evidence the acetylene route. Benzene (or 2,4-hexadiyne) could also come from acetylene. In fact, there is a linear relationship between m/z 78 and m/z 26 (Fig. 14c). Finally, Fig. 14d shows a linear relationship between m/z 50 (diacetylene) or benzene/2,4-hexadiyne (m/z 78) and carbon deposits which corroborates the formation of soot."
9,Conclusions,"A study on production of hydrogen through ethanol decomposition by a surface wave plasma at atmospheric pressure has been conducted. The plasma gas was a mixture of argon (0.50–1.50 L/min) and ethanol (0.22 g/h) which ensured full conversion throughout the whole flow range. The spectra recorded by using a monochromator as optical device showed the formation of radicals (CH, C2 and OH) and atomic species (C and H). A mass spectrometer was utilized to identify the gaseous by-products obtained at the plasma exit. Under all operational conditions, the main products were hydrogen (2.1–2.5 mol per mol of ethanol), carbon monoxide, acetylene and methane. Heavier organic compounds were just detected as traces (e.g. diacetylene). The characteristics of microwave plasmas at atmospheric pressure (in particular large number electrons thus resulting in continuous collisions of particles) could account for that. Some carbon deposits were also obtained whose amount increased with the decrease in Ar flow (i.e. longer residence times in the plasma and higher temperatures). Furthermore, a linear relationship between both benzene or diacetylene and carbon deposits was found which suggests that carbon deposits could have some soot contribution. All in all, the optimum conditions for hydrogen production corresponded to the lowest Ar flow (0.50 L/min)."
