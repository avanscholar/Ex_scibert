0,Introduction,"The actual significence of the catalytic reduction of carboxylic acids to alcohols has been surveyed in the previous paper [1] wherein the applicability of Ni/Al2O3 with co‐catalyst In2O3 was discussed. Indium doped Ni/Al2O3 catalyst proved to be highly efficient for directing the hydrogenation of fatty acids to aliphatic alcohols opening a novel route for catalyst development. Copper catalysts enable the selective addition of hydrogen to carbon–oxygen bonds but are relatively inactive in the hydrogenolysis of the carbon–carbon bonds unlike nickel catalysts [2]. From the early 1930s it is recognised that the chromium promoted copper catalysts show much higher activity and selectivity for alcohol formation than unpromoted ones [3]. Due to what happened the promotion effect of indium for copper catalyst can be also similarly efficient as for nickel and may substitute the chromium promoter applied in copper catalysts. Highly dispersed copper particles were generated on special aluminosilicate supports formed by destructive hydrogen reduction/dehydration of Cu zeolites. These samples have the lowest Si/Al ratios and consequently the highest cation content of quite homogeneous distribution. They show high activity and selectivity in the catalytic hydroconversion of carboxylic acids [4]. The activity and the selectivity to alcohols over these specially supported Cu catalysts can be effectively increased by In2O3 doping [4] similarly to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst [1]. Indium (III) oxide supported on zeolite or alumina has been found to be a suitable catalyst for the de‐NOx reactions [5], for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide [6,7]. However such supported In2O3 based materials have received limited attention as hydrogenation catalysts, where indium can be present in metal phase. Cu or Cu2In catalysts supported on destructed zeolites (zeolite structures collapsed in consequence of unstable H‐form formation, during reduction of charge compensating cations) having less than 30m2/g specific surface area, depending on the type of zeolite precursors [4]. Alumina support has more than six times higher surface area and its structure is well definied compared with the collapsed zeolite structures becoming X‐ray amorphous and containing small islands of unknown different phases. Indium doping to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst cannot give reliable information on indium doping to copper oxide since these two metals differ, e.g., the nickel oxide is partly reduced in hydrogen at the usual pretreatment temperature 450°C whereas copper oxide is fully reduced to metal (see later). The aim of present research is to learn more about influences of indium metal for the different active metals in the selective hydrogenation of carboxylic acid to alcohols."
1,Experimental,"The catalytic reduction of octanoic acid (OA) (Aldrich) as a model reactant with medium chain length, octanal (C8AL) (Fluka) as intermediate compound, and catalytic conversions of octanol (C8OL) (Fluka) as product are also investigated under similar conditions as in ref. [1] (in general at 20bar hydrogen, 1bar octanoic acid partial pressures in the temperature range of 240–360°C. Catalyst pretreatment was carried out in hydrogen flow in situ in the reactor at 450°C, 21bar for 1h). Product analysis as well as representation of results in stacked area graphs is similar as in ref. [1], i.e. the distance between two neighboring curves represents the concentration of a given product at a given temperature in weight percent. γ‐Al2O3 (Ketjen CK 300, Akzo‐Chemie, BET: 199m2/g) activated at 550°C was impregnated with NH4OH solution (Reanal Finechemical Co.) of Cu (acetate)2 (Merck) applying incipient wetness method, dried, and calcined at 550°C. After impregnation the specific surface area changed to 180m2/g, corresponding to 207m2/g alumina. The samples contained 3, 9 and 20wt.% copper designated as 3‐, 9‐, 20Cu/Al2O3. Composite catalysts were prepared by adding indium (III) oxide powder to the Cu/alumina samples and grinding the mixture in agate mortar. 159m2/g was the specific surface area of the composite which is equal to 203m2/galumina. X–ray patterns were recorded and evaluated as in ref. [1]."
2,Results and discussion,"NiIn/Al2O3 catalyst is more active in octanoic acid hydroconversion than CuIn/Al2O3 since the conversion and octanol yield curves are shifted by 20–30°C to higher temperatures for Cu,In/Al2O3 (Fig. 1 ). However, the product distributions are the same on the two bimetallic catalysts. Hence similarity of catalytically active phases seems probable. For 9Ni/Al2O3 catalyst at the routine pretreatment temperature, at 450°C only a small part of NiO is reduced and a complete reduction can be attained only at 650°C [1]. Contrarily, in 9Cu/Al2O3 catalyst copper oxide is already fully reduced at 200°C forming small copper particles of ~20 nm average diameter (∇ in Fig. 2a). These particles do not change up to 650°C (and not only up to 450°C as shown in Fig. 2a). Reduction of admixed In2O3 can be observed at much higher temperature, i.e., between 350 and 450°C (see Figs. 2b and 3a, b, c) detected by disappearence of In2O3 diffraction lines (*). This process is completed up to 450°C on all 9Cu/Al2O3 samples (see Fig. 3) but not on 3Cu/Al2O3 sample mixed with 10wt.% In2O3 (see Fig. 2b), where trace indium (III) oxide can be alone detected. This sample of the lowest copper content can already form copper–indium alloy directly with the generated indium metal atoms (•) above 350°C. In the case of this composition copper particles cannot be detected below the reduction temperature of In2O3 indicating either the formation of too small Cu0 nanoparticles not detectable by XRD method. More probably, the alloying of the low concentration Cu0 with small amount of reduced In2O3 as shown by the appearance of a new phase (marked with • in Figs. 2 and 3) which can be assigned to some kind of CuIn alloy. Mainly Cu2In phase, but Cu4In and Cu9In4 phases may also be present in lower concentration. These phases were determined based on ICDD database [8], the corresponding ICDD numbers are Cu2In: 42–1475, Cu4In: 42–1477 and Cu9In4: 42–1476. After treatment at 450°C for half an hour the 3Cu/Al2O3 sample mixed with 10wt.% In2O3 and cooling down the composite sample to R.T. the presence of excess solid metallic indium phase (+) can be also detected (see Fig. 2b) similarly to diffractograms of 9Cu/Al2O3 sample admixed with 20wt.% In2O3 containing also excess indium beyond the amount needed to alloy formation (Fig. 3c). Frozen indium particles with average sizes of ~130 nm are larger than copper particles indicating higher mobility of indium atoms above the melting point (156.4°C) than that of copper atoms. The 9Cu/Al2O3 +10wt.% In2O3 composite contains Cu and In nearly in 2:1 atomic ratio, so all amounts of two metals are consumed in formation of the alloy phase (Cu2In) having average sizes of ~10 nm (Fig. 3b). At lower In2O3 admission Cu and Cu2In phases are present altogether (Fig. 3a) and in composites containing indium in excess to the composition of Cu2In alloy phase, indium can also appear as distinct pure metal phase (see Figs. 3c or 2b), but it can only be detected below its melting point 156.4°C. The admitted In2O3 contains crystals with particles of ~70 nm average diameter (*) however it can form much bigger aggregates and the poor method applied for admission cannot result in homogeneous distribution, which can be true for CuO, too. A not uniform distribution can explain the presence of In2O3 near 3Cu/Al2O3 at 450°C in Fig. 2b and In detected at 25°C after admission only 3% In2O3 to 9Cu/Al2O3 (Fig. 3a). Formation of Cu and/or Cu2In alloy nanoparticles, and appearance of metallic indium on the support is evident on the basis of HT–XRD results. In view of catalytic properties complete understanding of the multiple behaviors over such a complex ensemble of active sites requires comprehensive catalytic investigations. On adding a large amount of In2O3 (10wt.% In2O3 of the mass of monometallic 9Cu/Al2O3 catalyst) as a co‐catalyst, the activity significantly increases and the selectivity changes strikingly by suppressing of the consecutive octanol dehydration side–reactions (cf. Fig. 4c and d). In Fig. 4 the catalytic properties of a commercial, conventionally used Adkins catalyst (consisting of 72wt.% CuCr2O4 and 28wt.% CuO, Fig. 4a) and our composites (mono‐ (Cu/Al2O3, Fig. 4c) or bimetallic alumina supported catalysts (CuIn/Al2O3, Fig. 4d)), and an In dopped destructed CuP zeolite (Fig. 4b) are compared along with the increasing reaction temperature under identical conditions. All the samples are able to produce alcohol from fatty acid with high selectivity, but the chromium free samples are able to give good selectivity in narrower temperature range than the Adkins catalyst. The novel CuIn/Al2O3 catalyst seems, however, to be more active: 80% overall conversion of OA on 9Cu/Al2O3 catalyst doped with 10wt.% In2O3 is attained at 310°C while on copper chromite at 350°C. Dioctyl ether ((C8)2O) formation in bimolecular octanol dehydration on CuIn/Al2O3 sample becomes significant only at high octanol yield above 310°C (Fig. 4). Monomolecular dehydration of octanol to octene (C8=) appears only above nearly full conversion of OA to octanol. Both acid catalysed side reactions may be attributed to alumina. However, these undesirable reactions can be highly mitigated on highly active and stable 9Cu/Al2O3 +10wt.% In2O3 catalyst composite, using lower reaction temperature and higher space velocity. Use of indium as efficient promoter with Cu/Al2O3 catalyst turned out also to be a success (Fig. 4) similarly to In2O3 doped Ni/Al2O3 samples [1]. However, for In2O3 doped Cu/Al2O3 samples at constant indium content (10wt.% in Fig. 5 ) the conversion and the octanol yield (the product distribution) is hardly influenced by the Cu–content between 3 and 20wt.%. Similar behavior can be observed at a fixed Cu‐loading (9wt.%) changing the amount of added indium oxide in 3–20wt.% range (see in Fig. 6 ). Hence it seems likely to apply in low concentration the expensive, but strongly efficient In2O3 co‐catalyst. It can be estimated that both active metal components can be used in about 10wt.% to attain high carboxylic acid conversion with high and stable octanol yield (fauling of these catalysts was not observed). The weak influence of the concentration changes of both active metals in a wide range can be explained by supposing the most efficient active sites on the surface of the Cu2In alloy. This phase surpasses the activity of copper or mainly indium metal surfaces while the composition and the mass of bulk phase inside the metal particles does not affect significantly the surface reactions (Figs. 5 and 6). Beyond the metal phase which is active in hydrogenation, the support applied and its interactions with the In2O3 co‐catalyst may be of importance to ensure the advantageous catalytic properties. Fig. 7 demonstrates the catalytic effects observed for alumina support and the copper free composite interacting with the reactant OA (Fig. 7a, A), with the intermediate product aldehyde (Fig. 7b, B) and with the desired final product alcohol (Fig. 7c, C). The support has no activity contrary to the presumably well dispersed indium metal (working highly above its melting point), which shows some hydrogenating activity producing mainly octanal and less octanol. The intermedier octanal is extremely reactive in aldol type condensation leading to formation of 2‐hexyldec‐2‐enal /(C8)2ALD/ in high concentration mainly on alumina (Fig. 7b). Furthermore aliphatic octyl aldehyde can easily be reduced to octyl alcohol in presence of indium, as reflected in Fig. 7B. Octanol then can be dehydrated to octenes over the naked alumina support, as confirmed in Fig. 7c using octanol as reactant. At lower reaction temperature, the dominant reaction route of octanol transformation is the bimolecular dehydration which forms dioctyl ether. Increasing the temperature, monomolecular dehydration becomes the main reaction pathway resulting in olefin formation. Probably this change of dehydration pathway is essentially affected by the decreasing alcohol coverage on the surface controlled by the increasing temperature. Using octanal as reactant, dioctyl ether yield is very low because the alcohol formation is suppressed by competing aldol condensation on the alumina surface (Fig. 7b). Comparison of the two sides of Fig. 7 gives some insight to the role of indium: i., OA can be reduced although with much lower rate on indium (Fig. 7A) than on copper particles (squares in Fig. 6); ii., aldol condensation of octanal and octanol dehydration are greatly suppressed by indium (Fig. 7b–B) and iii., the secondary reactions of octanol are suppressed as well by indium suggesting that indium can cover at least partly the surface of the alumina support (Fig. 7c–C). However the low, but significant production of ether and alkenes from octanol indicates that the missing components: copper or octanoic acid should have some influence on suppressing the dehydration of alcohol. Fig. 8b proves that the presence of fatty acid plays an important role to poison the active centers of dehydration together with indium, because octanol can be highly dehydrated over CuIn/Al2O3 catalyst, i.e., in presence of copper and indium on alumina, but in absence of the organic acid reactant. Fig. 8a shows that copper and indium can promote the reduction of the aldehyde with hydrogen at a much lower temperature than indium alone (Fig. 7B). The octanoic acid conversion to octanol over the 9Cu/Al2O3 catalyst doped with 10wt.% In2O3 similarly increases roughly linearly with increasing hydrogen partial pressure between 4 and 18bar (Fig. 9 ) and inversely with octanoic acid partial pressure (Fig. 10 ), i.e., to the coverage of active sites by adsorbed fatty acid seems to suppress hydrogen as in the case of Ni,In/Al2O3 [1]. Both observations are in accordance with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics. Unlike indium doped Ni/Al2O3 catalyst [1] the lower activity of CuIn/alumina composite is reflected in the dependence on octanoic acid partial pressure, too. At lower coverage of the carboxylic acid, where hydrogen coverage may be higher resulting in higher OA conversion, the yield of octanol is lower, but the less reduced intermedier, the octanal is higher. This finding opens a way of aldehyde production instead of alcohol broadened the list of available products."
3,Conclusions,"Indium doping has been discovered to be highly efficient in reduction of fatty acids with hydrogen, opening a novel route for catalyst development. Hydrogenation of carboxylic acid of medium chain length resulting selectively in alcohol production can be increased by In2O3 doping similarly over both Cu or Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Presence of metallic indium or rather alloying copper particles supported on alumina can effectively stop the step by step catalytic hydrogenation of fatty acids after alcohol formation inhibiting the following mono‐ or bimolecular dehydrations. High conversion with high level of octanol selectivity can be attained in a wide loading range of Cu and In on alumina support. Copper oxide can be more easily reduced to metallic nanoparticles at lower temperature than indium (III) oxide, but equally below the pretreatment temperature (450°C). This difference is not reflected by any change of catalytic behaviour in a wide range of Cu and In content. Appearance of Cu2In alloy phase on the surface of metal particles results in significant increase of hydrogenation activity, beyond this, the presence of well‐dispersed indium atoms or clusters in liquid state on the surface of alumina support seems to be decisive in selective poisoning the alcohol dehydration capability of the support. The activity dependence on the reactant partial pressures reveals Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics with rate controlling surface reaction over a CuIn/Al2O3 composite catalyst."
