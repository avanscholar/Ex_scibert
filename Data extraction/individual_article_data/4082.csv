0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of economic and society, energy shortage, environment pollution and climate change issues have become severe in recent years. Hence, the development and utilization of renewable energy attract more and more attention (Ellabban et al., 2014). Because of the high heat value (55 kJ/g and 143 kJ/g, respectively) of methane and hydrogen, and the advantage of non-pollution release after utilization, they are widely used in chemical and process industries. Considering that methane has more application method and hydrogen has highest heat value (Roy and Das, 2016). Hythane, a hydrogen-methane blend with hydrogen concentration between 10% and 30% by volume (Bolzonella et al., 2018), has been developed to maximise the heat recovery and expand the use of hydrogen. Hythane does not require major changes of the storage system of compressed natural gas (CNG), and can reduce the air pollutants emission while maintaining the energy efficiency (Mishra et al., 2017). Hence, more and more attempts of bio-hythane production from renewable sources by anaerobic digestion (AD) have been conducted (Liu et al., 2018; Lunprom et al., 2019). As a complex process, AD can be divided into four steps: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanation. Each step has a dominating metabolic group of microorganisms (Mathew et al., 2014). Two-stage AD consists of separating the biological chain of acetogenesis and methanogenesis into two different bioreactors (Luongo Malave et al., 2015), which reduce the inhibitory effect of the inhibitors generating from the other step. Hence, two-stage AD for bio-H2 and bio-CH4 production has been considered superior to single-stage AD biogas production because of the higher substrate conversion efficiency (Si et al., 2020; Chatterjee and Mazumder, 2019). Algapani et al. (2019) investigated the effects of digestate re-circulation on energy efficiency and process stability. Maximum H2 production of 3L H2 L−1d−1 were achieved for a recirculation ratio of 0.3, which also showed best potential for CH4 producing. The substrate conversion efficiency was around 70% under this integrated two-stage digestate recirculation system. Another innovative two-stage anaerobic digestion reactor was developed by Petracchini et al (2018), a stable long-term run was found due to the reactor configuration and the digestate post-treatment with natural zeolite. The biogas production was very stable and high with 75% soluble COD removal efficiency. In the previous studies, bio-hythane production focuses on the combination of dark-fermentation bio-H2 production and bio-CH4 production (Luo et al., 2011; Hans and Kumar, 2019). The hydrogen yield is much lower than photo-fermentation bio-H2 production (PFHP). However, it is still not clear whether the latter would show a satisfactory performance in the process of bio-hythane production. Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) can utilize various feedstock, such as agricultural waste (Garcia-Pena et al., 2013; Arimi et al., 2015). After photo-fermentation, fatty acids and alcohols are generated, which inhibit the bio-hydrogen production process while can be digested by methanogens (Zhang et al., 2011; Mamimin et al., 2017). Hence, the cohesive strategy of two-stage bio-hythane production through photo-fermentation bio-H2 production followed by bio-CH4 production was investigated. For the whole AD process, the cohesive strategy of coupling time node (CTN) will help to control the compositions in the effluent. Given that the two-stage AD approach adopts effluent of PFHP, this paper investigates the effects of diverse CTN, in order to maximum the energy conversion efficiency and maintain the suitable H2 content of the bio-hythane."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrate and microorganisms,"2.1 Substrate and microorganisms Substrate preparation: 15 parts of 5 g corncob powder (particle size range of 80–120 μm, moisture content of 8.3%, volatile solids (VS) of 96.7%, total solids (TS) of 91.7%, cellulose content of 36.1%, hemicellulose content of 39.6%) were put into 250 mL conical flasks respectively. Then each flask was added 100 mL 0.5 M citric acid-sodium citrate buffer and 0.75 g cellulose (enzymatic activity of 30 units per mg). Shaken well before sealed, all flasks were seated into a constant temperature oscillator for 48 h enzymatic hydrolysis at 50 °C and 150 r/min. The enzymatic hydrolyzates of corncob powder were taken as substrate. Strains and medium: Hydrogen-producing photosynthetic bacteria (PSB): PSB HAU-M1 was provided by key laboratory of new materials and facilities for rural renewable energy. It contained Rhodospirillum rubrum, Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (Zhang et al., 2017). Growth medium and hydrogen production medium for the PSB HAU-M1 were listed in the previous study (Zhang et al., 2017). Methane-producing bacteria: Bacteria were obtained through the fermentation of a mixture of cow dung and straw in an anaerobic environment and subsequent filtration through a 0.5 mm sieve."
3,Procedures of the two-stage bio-hythane production,"2.2 Procedures of the two-stage bio-hythane production The first procedure is PFHP stage. After enzymatic hydrolysis, corncob powders were degraded into reducing sugars with low-molecular weight. The hydrolysate mixture was titrated to a neutral pH with 50% KOH solution, and then hydrogen production medium was added according to the preset ratio. Strains (mostly is the 2nd-3rd day after subculture) were added at 30% inoculation. All the conical flasks with the reaction mixture were placed in a constant-temperature incubator at 30 °C for hydrogen production with a light intensity of 3000 lx. Tests were divided into five levels, and the corresponding variables were the coupling time nodes of the two-stage AD process, which were 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 60 h, respectively. With different CTN, the fermentation process shifted from bio-H2 production to bio-CH4 production. Each level was conducted triple time. The second procedure is bio-CH4 producing stage. Effluents from bio-H2 production stage with diverse coupling time node were titrated to a neutral pH with 50% KOH solution in this batch experiment, which can be replaced by digestate recirculation or additive buffer to provide stable pH when conduct scale up test. Biogas slurry with the highest methane yield was selected and inoculated into the effluents at a 40% ratio, then, placed into dark condition with 35 °C constant-temperature incubator for methane production."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The total solids and volatile solids were determined according to Standard methods (APHA, 2005) Samples for the determination of volatile fatty acid (VFA) were centrifuged at 10,000 r/min for 15 min. pH was tested by a pH meter. Composition analysis of biogas was detected using the Agilent 6820 GC-14B gas chromatography equipped with a 5 A molecular sieve for column packing. Nitrogen was carrier gas with a flow rate of 45 mL/min. High pure hydrogen (99.999%) was used as a standard gas. Temperatures of the inlet, column oven and TCD were of 100 °C, 800 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Sample volume was 500 μL with 2 min retention time. Fermentative broth compositions were analyzed with Agilent 6820 GC-14B gas chromatography equipped with a DB-FFAP (30 m × 0.323 mm × 1.00 μm). The column had an initial temperature of 60 °C, ramp 4 °C/min to 100 °C (5 min hold time). Temperature of the injector and detector were 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively. Sample volume was 1.0 μL, working with a pressure of 0.05 MPa and a gas flow rate of 30 mL/min."
5,Kinetic parameters of PFHP process,"2.4 Kinetic parameters of PFHP process A modified Gompertz model was employed to fit the experimental data from the bio-H2 production tests (Zhang et al., 2017), the kinetic parameters were determined by the following formula: (1) P H 2 t = P max exp - exp r m e P max λ - t + 1 where, PH 2 (t) is cumulative hydrogen yield (mL), Pmax is the maximum hydrogen yield potential (mL), rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is lag time (h), t is fermentation time (h), e is 2.718."
6,Energy conversion efficiency evaluation,"2.5 Energy conversion efficiency evaluation Maximum the recovery of the energy from agricultural waste is the essential target, hence, the energy conversion efficiency in the process of bio-hythane production need to be evaluated. The energy conversion efficiency of bio-hythane was defined as follows: E = V H 2 · Q H 2 + V C H 4 · Q C H 4 Q corncob · m corncob × 100 % where, E is the energy conversion efficiency, %. VH 2 and V CH 4 is the volume of bio-H2 and bio-CH4, respectively, mL. QH 2 is the heat value of hydrogen gas, 12.86 J/mL. QCH 4 is the heat value of methane gas, 35.82 J/mL. Qcorncob is the heat value of the corncob powder, 17752.20 J/g. mcorncob is the weight of the corncob powder, g."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Performance of bio-H2 production stage in the two-stage fermentation process,"3.1 Performance of bio-H2 production stage in the two-stage fermentation process The first stage of experiments was carried out at same condition, while ended at diverse times to determine the composition of the fermentative broth, and taken the different effluents as substrate for the second stage. The fitting results and kinetic parameters are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 . Demonstrated by a modified Gompertz equation, the fitting of hydrogen yield achieved a correlation coefficient (R2) value higher than 0.99, suggesting that the data was fitting well. Except for the CTN of 12 h and 36 h, the actual volume of hydrogen produced by photo-fermentation was similar to the predicted hydrogen yield. The special performances illustrated the importance of the selection of CTN. When the CTN was 12 h, just one data was obtained. Given that the lag phase time is around 10 h, which meant bio-H2 production stage just began, the curve cannot be drawn to predict the hydrogen yield under that situation. When the CTN was 36 h and the lag time was 23.78 h, highest predicted hydrogen yield and hydrogen producing rate were obtained. The reason of the discrepancy may because that the hydrogen producing peak appeared around 36 h. Hence, the ceasing of hydrogen production stage may cause powerful influence on the microorganism metabolism and the liquid environment. Besides these two exceptional cases, hydrogen production process conducted stably with tiny distinguish of the lag time. Lag time is a key parameter during the AD, especially in the two-stage fermentation process, because that the lag phase time can express the start-up performance in terms of biogas production, and can provide reference about the selection of suitable CTN (Fabrícia et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2017). Based on the obtained lag time above, the CTN should be greater than 10 h at least. Fig. 2 illustrates the evolution of the pH during the PFHP stage and the organic matter in the fermentative broth with diverse CTN. Results showed that pH decreased dramatically in the first 12 h, varying from 5.36 to 5.73. After 12 h, pH decreased to around 5.5, while acidogenic system remained stable in the whole bio-H2 production period by the narrow range of pH values, which demonstrated that the hydrogen production process was going on smoothly. pH values within 5–6 are often considered ideal to enhance bio-H2 generation and avoid methanogenesis (Guo et al., 2010). Compared with the hydrogen yield, results clearly showed that pH can indicate the hydrogen yield potential. When pH is higher than 6, the hydrogen yield decreases. Different CTN led to different organic compounds, which were mainly soluble metabolic products. Same results were obtained previously (Cooney et al., 2007). Longer the first bio-H2 production stage was, higher the contents of ethanol and propionic acid were. Acetic acid and isobutyric acid cumulated over time. Given that the organic matter contents were not fully degraded, a subsequent bio-CH4 production stage was feasibility to further convert the substrate and to exploit the energy potential."
9,Performance of bio-CH4 production stage in the two-stage AD process,"3.2 Performance of bio-CH4 production stage in the two-stage AD process After different period of incubation, bio-H2 production process ceased. The effluents acidified from the acidogenesis stage were used as substrate for methanogenesis. The optimum pH value of methanogens is 6.8–7.2, therefore it was necessary to monitor the pH of methanogenic stage. The fluctuation of pH during the methanogenic stage is shown in Fig. 3 (a). The results showed that the pH of the diverse CTN groups in the methanogenesis stage had the same changing trend. pH changed obviously in the first 10 days. It decreased in the first five days, then increased rapidly from 6th days to 10th days, and gradually stabilized at around 7.5 after 10th days. The reason maybe that the concentration of organic matter in the initial fermentative broth was high, which provided sufficient nutrition for the growth and metabolism of acidogenic bacteria. At this time, acidogenic bacteria decomposed the substrate to produce acid, so the pH of solution decreased. The activity of methanogens was low under the pH of between 5 and 6, so the acid consumption was small and resulted in an accumulation of acids. After the eighth day, for the activity of methanogenic microorganisms recovered and the substrate was sufficient, the stage reached the peak period of gas peak. pH tended to be stable after the tenth day, the rate of acid production and consumption gradually reached a dynamic equilibrium, indicating that the peak period of gas production is winding down. Related phenomenon was observed in Fig. 3(b) and (c). The bio-CH4 production rate was slow in the first 5 days. Owing to the enough organic matter in the fermentative broth that could be utilized by methanogens, the bio-CH4 production began to increase from the 6th day. The fastest bio-CH4 production rate was shown during 8th–14th days. After 14th days, the cumulative methane production was still increasing, but the rate of methane production decreased slowly. Cessation of methane production appeared during the final 24–30 days except that the methane production stopped at 14th day when CTN was 60 h. The reason maybe that organic matter was pretty lack after 60 h bio-H2 production, so the second stage was very short. While, organic matter was sufficient and the fermentative broth was suitable for bio-CH4 production under other cohesive strategy (CTN of 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h), hence, the second stage of bio-CH4 production last longer. Results showed that methane yield was relatively high when the CTNs are 12 h, 24 h and 48 h, which were 684.1 mL, 677.3 mL and 647.8 mL, respectively. The highest methane production rate of 3.7 mL/h appeared at eighth day when the CTN was 12 h. Given the changes of the organic matter in Fig. 4 , the cumulative of acetic acid and isobutyric acid in the first 5 days explained the sharp decrease in pH in the methane production stage, which also displayed negative effect on the bio-CH4 production. After 5 days, decreases in the organic matter content until the end of the experiment were noticed for all the groups. In the second stage of bio-CH4 production, ethanol consumed quickly, and couldn’t measure in the following reaction no matter which CTN was. Highest initial acetic acid content of 690.11 mg appeared when the CTN was 24 h. Comparing the CTN of 36 h, 48 h, and 60 h, in which the content of acetic acid and isobutyric acid rise in the first 5 days and then gradually dropped. The findings suggested that acetic acid was fully obtained after 24 h PFHP, hence, there was no acetic acid produced in the second methane production stage. In the beginning of the second stage, further digestion was going on, showing increase of acetic acid and isobutyric content, which were the main substrate for the methanogenic bacteria. Results showed that cohesive strategy had significant influence on the end-products. Overall, the results demonstrated the feasibility of using the effluents from the photo-fermentation bio-H2 production process for bio-CH4 production, and showed excellent organic matter removal efficiency."
10,Assessment of the two-stage AD system: bio-hythane yield and energy conversion efficiency,"3.3 Assessment of the two-stage AD system: bio-hythane yield and energy conversion efficiency According to the results above, diverse CTN led to different biogas production performance, for acidified effluent sample resulting from the bio-H2 production stage was different. An overview of the bio-H2 and bio-CH4 yields in the two-stage anaerobic digestion system under diverse CTN is shown in Fig. 5 . The highest bio-CH4 yield occurred at CTN of 12 h, while the bio-H2 yield was pretty low. When the CTN grew bigger, bio-H2 yield increased and bio-CH4 decreased, which caused the changes of content of hydrogen and methane in the biogas. Results showed that when the CTNs were 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 60 h, the hydrogen contents in the bio-hythane were 1.9%, 4.6%, 13.4%, 13.6%, and 18.3%, respectively. Among of them, considering of the demand of the bio-hythane composition, the suitable percentage of hydrogen was found to appear when the CTN was bigger than 36 h. Though hydrogen has higher heat value, the hydrogen offers less energy per volume. Therefore, it can be stated that bio-H2 generation is not competitive with bio-CH4 yield (Zhu, et al., 2008). Hence, based on the bio-H2 and bio-CH4 yields obtained in the two-stage AD under diverse cohesive strategy, the energy conversion efficiency was calculated to evaluate the energy recovery from the raw material. The energy conversion efficiency of the five groups was 27.8%, 27.8%, 23.5%, 27.6%, and 23.7%, respectively. The results indicate that bio-hythane is efficiently produced in two-stage AD due to the better degradation of substrate under these coupling time nodes. Moreover, suitable CTN can produce bio-hythane with proper hydrogen content directly, no additional processing is required. Taking all the results into account, the optimal cohesive strategy was found to be the CTN of 48 h. Under that situation, bio-H2 yield and bio-CH4 yield were 22.29 mL/g TS and 141.14 mL/g TS, respectively. The hydrogen concent in the bio-hythane was 13.64%, and the energy conversion efficiency was 27.6%."
11,Conclusions,"The utilization of effluent of bio-H2 production process for bio-CH4 production was investigated under diverse coupling time node. The effluents contain large number of VFA and ethanol, and show diverse bio-CH4 yield potential. Cohesive strategy significantly affects the bio-hythane production performance. When the CTN is 48 h, the two-stage anaerobic digestion system displays higher energy conversion efficiency and suitable hydrogen content. These results show that the cohesive strategy adopted in this study by control the CTN can realize the directional generation of bio-hythane, and improve the energy conversion efficiency of the co-generation anaerobic digestion system."
