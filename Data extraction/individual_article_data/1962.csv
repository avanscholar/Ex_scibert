0,Introduction,"In the field of fuel cells, the selection and the development of an efficient catalyst is very vital, and therefore, the controllable production of catalysts with variety of size and shape has attracted extensive interest in this area [1,2]. Even though the DAFCs (Direct Alcohol Fuel Cells) are known as the promising energy source for fulfilling the inevitable energy demands especially in portable electronic devices, the efficiency of catalysts is still not satisfactory [3–6]. Until now, Pt has been viewed as the most efficient catalyst for anode reaction [7,8]. But, the expensive and limited supply of Pt extremely interrupted the large scale manufacturing of DAFC [9-11]. As of now, Pd is considered to be the appropriate alternative of Pt owing to exhibiting similar properties with Pt [12,13]. Meanwhile, it is 50 times abundant, and relatively cheaper than Pt [14–16]. Eventually, Pd exhibits an outstanding activity and stability in alkaline medium [17–19]. However, it is indeed necessary to reduce the amount of Pd owing to its very high cost, and simultaneously, the activity also need to be improvised. In this view, one of the highly rated strategies developed is combining the transition metals with Pd to obtain an alloy. Incorporation of Ni, Cu, Ag, Fe, Au, etc. with Pd is observed to influenced the catalytic activity and improved the efficiency through bi-functional mechanism [20–24]. The particle morphology is one of the crucial factors upon which the catalytic active sites are highly dependent [25–28]. Therefore, development of various catalysts with fascinating morphologies having high surface area has become another crucial strategy for enhancing the catalytic efficiency [29,30]. Recently, one dimensional nanostructure is emerged as the new class of material in various fields including catalysis, optoelectronics, nano science, sensing, biological applications, etc. [31,32]. The unique structural features with high aspect ratios hold the key for its fascinating optical and electrical properties. The specific architecture possesses advantages like structural anisotropy, large surface area, high flexibility and high conductance [33,34]. The common issues associated with nano particles include dissolution, aggregation and Ostwald ripening, which can be controlled to an extent. The peculiar structure can able to promote the electron transport characteristic due to the path directing effect of structural anisotropy. The easy transport of electrons associated with the 1D structure also favor the enhancement of catalytic activity [35]. The structural robustness provides more active surface area to take part in the reaction and in turn boost the activity. Gold is known as an amazing element owing to its unique properties including its inert nature. Most interesting fact is when size is reduced to nano level, gold show tremendous changes in its physical properties, and its activeness enhanced significantly from its bulk state owing to which it is much more reactive in its nanostate [36–40]. This unique feature encouraged the researchers to apply gold in the field of catalysis and sensing [40,41]. The gold nano particles are observed to be very active towards CO oxidation which is highly encouraging factor to apply gold nano particles in CO oxidation at ambient temperatures [42–47]. The combination of Au with Pd can effectively promote the oxidation of the adsorbed intermediate CO species on Pd. Several studies have done in the field of electrochemistry using Au and Pd. Luo et al., developed PdAu nanocatalyst with variable atom ratio for methanol oxidation [48]. Caglar and Kivrak reported carbon nanotube supported PdAu alloy catalyst for ethanol oxidation [49]. Au@PdAg core shell nanotubes were used for the oxidation of methanol and Au@PdAg NSs decorated rGO was used for ethanol oxidation [50,51]. Liu et al., synthesised AuPd alloy on graphene for ethanol oxidation [52]. AuPtPd nano dendrites performed as excellent catalyst towards hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction and AuPd nano alloys reported as good catalyst for hydrogen peroxide oxidation [53,54]. Meanwhile, the nano porous AuPd showed better activity for alcohol oxidation. Lu et al. reported porous Pd Au films for methanol oxidation [55]. Au decorated Pd cubes were also reported for methanol oxidation [56]. Very few efforts have made in synthesizing AuPd alloy nano wire for electrocatalyst application so far. Zhu et al. prepared PdAu alloy nano wire through a template assisted method for sensing nonenzymatic glucose. The synthetic protocol involves complicated and relatively time-consuming processes [57]. Wang et al. synthesized PdAu nano wire for methanol oxidation, where the adopted method was simple, though the consumption of hazardous aminopyridine makes the preparation non-reliable [58]. In addition, no attempts have done in the direction of reducing the amount of Pd. Here we demonstrate an extremely rapid synthesis ( ̴ 5 min) of ultrathin PdAu nano wire with high aspect ratio without utilizing any complicated synthetic strategy. The as prepared catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic activity towards alcohol oxidation. In this work bimetallic PdAu nano wires having diameter of 5 nm was synthesized by a simple and rapid method. The Pd incorporated Au wire was obtained through a simple reduction method there by eliminating the carbon corrosion problem. Morphology, chemical composition and purity of the prepared catalysts were analyzed in detail. The electrocatalytic properties of the samples were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometric measurements."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chloroauric acid, Palladium (II) chloride, ά-naphthol, Sodium borohydride, Potassium hydroxide, Methanol and Ethanol. All chemicals were purchased from Merck chemicals and utilized as obtained."
3,Preparation of PdAu nano wire,"2.2 Preparation of PdAu nano wire A mixture of 4.5 ml 0.05 M HAuCl4 and required amount of 10 mM H2PdCl4 were heated to 60°C under water bath. Subsequently added 0.5 M α-naphthol ethanol and 0.2 M NaBH4 solution. The pale yellow color of the solution immediately changed to black. The obtained product collected by centrifugation and washed well using ethanol solution [59]. Different composition of PdAu nano wire was synthesized by varying the quantity of precursors. The simple and rapid synthetic procedure was elaborated schematically ( Scheme 1 ) . Required amount of gold and palladium precursors were mixed with α-naphthol ethanol solution and sodium borohydride at moderate temperature followed by aging for a very short span. The oxygen ligand in the α-naphthol coordinates with Au (III) and form metal complex. The π-π interactions between the rings in the α naphthol may lead to self-assembly of complexes in to one dimensional gold wires [59]. Therefore, α-naphthol functioned as coordination agent, reducing agent and structural directing agent simultaneously. By varying the quantity of precursors, 5, 10, 15% Pd containing Au rich PdAu nano wires were prepared, which are designated as 5% PdAu NW, 10% PdAu NW, and 15% PdAu NW, respectively. Pure Pd nanoparticle catalyst was prepared by the reduction of Pd precursor using NaBH4 reducing agent, for the comparative analysis of the catalytic activity of prepared PdAu NW catalyst. The compositions of the prepared samples were analyzed using SEM-EDS (Fig. S1)."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization X-ray diffraction pattern was collected using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), (Philips X'pert Pro) equipped with Cu Kα (λ = 0.154060 nm) radiation over 2θ ranging from 10 to 90˚ with a step size of 0.08˚. The microstructures of the prepared samples were examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). X-ray photoelectron study was conducted on X- ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), (PHI 5000 Versa Probe II). The obtained spectra were referenced to the C 1 s binding energy of 284.8 eV. The oxidation states of the metal in the sample were analyzed using XPS."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical work station Autolab (M204) was utilized to perform the electrochemical measurements. In a standard three electrode system a catalyst modified glassy carbon electrode, a double junction Ag/AgCl electrode and a platinum wire were served as the working, reference and counter electrode respectively. Catalyst ink prepared by dispersing the catalyst in distilled water, were dropped on the cleaned glassy carbon electrode surface. Subsequently added 3 µl 0.5 wt% Nafion solutions using a micropipette. The catalyst loading was 0.225 mg/cm2. Cyclic voltamograms were recorded in N2 saturated 0.5 M KOH solution at scan rate of 50 mV/s. CVs of Methanol Oxidation Reaction (MOR) and Ethanol Oxidation Reaction (EOR) were obtained in N2 saturated 0.5 M KOH solution containing 0.5 M methanol and ethanol respectively at a scan rate of 50 mV/s."
6,Results and discussions,"Morphology of the prepared catalysts monitored by TEM and depicted in Fig. 1 , showing well defined uniform wires having the diameter of ~ 5 nm, and length up to several hundreds of nanometers. Thus, the as synthesized nano wires possess high aspect ratio. Higher resolution images presented in Fig. S2, shows crystalline lattice fringes in 10% PdAu NW. The interplanar spacing has also been calculated and indexed (Fig. S2c). The lattice spacing calculated for the prepared PdAu nanowires is 0.232 nm, which is observed in between the Pd (111) lattice spacing (0.225 nm) and Au (111) lattice spacing (0.236 nm). The result indicates the PdAu alloy formation [50,51,60]. The higher resolution images of 5% PdAu NW and 15% PdAu NW are depicted in Fig. S3 and S4 the values of inter planar spacing are also indexed. Fig. S5 shows the TEM images of highly interconnected pure Pd nanoparticles with an average particle size ~20 nm. Phase purity of the prepared catalysts has been examined using X-ray diffractometer, and the obtained pattern is depicted in Fig. 2 . The peaks observed for pure Pd are well matched with the standard cubic structure of Pd (JCPDS 46–1043). The diffraction peaks at 2θ, 40.33˚, 46.93˚, 68.29˚, 82.27˚, and 86.92˚ are corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) planes of Pd. Au shows peaks at 38.56˚, 44.76˚, 64.92˚, 77.87˚, and 82.06˚ which are ascribed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) miller planes of cubic Au structure (04–0784) [52]. As shown in the Fig. 2 a, Pd incorporated Au nano wires exhibited a shift in XRD peaks to lower diffraction angle from that of Au and Pd. The observation clearly designates the successful formation of PdAu alloy NW and suggests an expansion in the lattice parameters. However, the extent of lattice expansion tend to decrease on varying the alloy composition from 5, 10 and 15 wt%, since the diffraction peaks have shifted to higher 2θ angle, Fig. 2 b. Moreover, crystallinity of the prepared NW catalysts found to decrease from that of pure Pd and Au, understood from the decrease in diffraction peak intensity and increase in FWHM. The calculated crystallite size using Scherrer formula of each alloy compounds are 16.64, 14.49 and 11.97 nm for 5, 10 and 15 wt% PdAu NWs, respectively. Further, based on Vegard's law alloying degree of the prepared catalysts have calculated to be 6.4, 12.6 and 17.2% for 5, 10 and 15 wt% PdAu NWs, respectively [61,62]. The surface chemical composition and oxidation states of the elements present in the developed PdAu NW catalyst are determined by conducting X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, which is also helping to understand the existence of Pd and Au. Fig. 3 a and 3 b display the deconvoluted spectra of Au and Pd, respectively. The binding energy values at 84.0 and 87.7 eV, as illustrated in Fig. 3 a, assigned to Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states of indicative of Au(0). As exposed in Fig. 3 b, Pd deconvoluted spectra has been fitted to four peaks. The peaks located at binding energies 335.6, 340.9 eV attributed to Pd 3d5/2, 3d3/2 corresponds to Pd(0). The small peaks at 337.8 and 343.1 eV assigned to Pd2+ [63]. The small shift in the binding energy values from the reported values of pure Pd (335.0 and 340.3 eV) and Au (83.8 and 87.4 eV) implies a strong electronic modification between the metals Pd and Au [48,64]. Thus the alloy formation is confirmed from the XPS technology. The electrochemical properties of the samples are studied using cyclic voltammetry. Fig. 4 a represents the respective CV curves recorded in N2 saturated 0.5 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. The potential range −0.8 to −0.4 V in the forward scan correspond to hydrogen adsorption and oxidation of Pd to PdO was observed at higher positive potential range. Further, reduction of PdO in the backward scan potential range −0.1 to −0.6 V resulted in the regeneration of Pd. [65,66] The parameter associated with the active sites of the catalysts, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is calculated by integrating the charge required for the reduction of PdO. ECSA estimated using the equation, ECSA = Q 0.405 × l Where ‘Q’ represents the PdO reduction charge and ‘l’ indicates the catalyst loading. The value of charge is assumed to be 0.405 mC /cm2 for the PdO monolayer reduction [67]. The ECSA for the catalysts 5, 10, 15% PdAu NW and pure Pd are calculated to be 74.8, 115.7, 96.8 and 11.2 m2/g, respectively. The unique morphology attributed to the improved ECSA. The one-dimensional wire type morphologies usually provide more active sites to take part. The remarkably higher activity of 10%PdAu NW is evident from the ECSA. Electrocatalytic activity of the prepared catalysts towards methanol oxidation is evaluated by performing the CV in N2 saturated solution containing 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M methanol at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. Typical cyclic voltammograms of different Pd Au NW catalysts are depicted in Fig. 4 b. Mass activities obtained for the catalysts are tabulated in Table 1 . Even though all the prepared catalysts imparted improved activity than the pure Pd, 10 wt% PdAu NW showed superior catalytic activity than others in terms of onset as well as peak potential and mass activity. Ten times increment in the mass activity is observed even after reducing the amount of Pd to 90% ( Fig. 4 d). Bifunctional effects of Pd and Au along with the one-dimensional morphology of the catalyst could be attributed to the considerable enhancement in the activity of the catalyst. The problem of carbon corrosion can be eliminated. The 1D morphology reduces the aggregation, dissolution and Ostwald ripening of Pd particles and improves the activity of Pd. The anisotropic morphology also imparts better electronic transportation which in turn increases the performance. The mechanism of methanol oxidation is given below [68,69]. The outstanding catalytic property of gold towards CO oxidation significantly helped to remove the CO molecules adsorbed on the Pd surface there by facilitating the reaction kinetics. The CO tolerance of Pd gets enhanced by the presence of Au. The released active sites have been proceeded further via the following reactions. (1) Pd+ CH3OH → Pd-(CH3OH)ads (2) Pd-(CH3OH) ads →Pd-(CO)ads + 4H+ + 4e (3) Au + H2O → Au -OH ads + H + + e ̄ (4) Pd-(CO) ads + Au -OH ads → Pd + Au +CO2+ H + + e ̄ Stability studies of the prepared catalyst are done by Chronoamperometric measurements at a potential of −0.4 V for 4000 s in an N2 saturated solution containing 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M methanol. Due to the formation of the intermediate CO, current value decreases after some times. As shown in Fig. 4 c the slow decay value indicates the 10 wt% PdAu NW possesses a better stability than the other catalysts for methanol oxidation. Stability studies are further conducted by performing the cyclic voltammetry analysis for 500 cycles. Fig. 5 depicts the corresponding cyclic voltammograms. Decay rate of current in the case of 10% PdAu NW catalyst is better than that of pure Pd. In the case of 10% PdAu NW the initial current value 2253.34 mA/mgPd reached 1753.48 mA/mgPd whereas for pure Pd the current value 193.4 mA/mgPd reduced to 99.86 mA/mgPd, almost half of the initial value. The onset potential for 10% PdAu NW is deviated by less extent −0.39 V to −0.37 V. For pure Pd the onset potential shifted from −0.38 to −0.31 V. A higher deviation has been observed in the case of pure Pd. The catalytic activity towards electro oxidation of ethanol has also been carried out in an N2 saturated solution containing 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M ethanol at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. Similar results are observed in this case also. Developed PdAu NW catalysts exhibited increased activity than that of the pure Pd catalyst. Among them 10 wt% PdAu NW showed supreme catalytic activity than others. A mass activity of 2137.9, 2960.40, 2724.4 mA/mgPd are obtained for 5, 10, 15% PdAu NWs, respectively, and the activity for pure Pd is calculated to be 522.8 mA/mg. The respective CV curves are depicted in Fig. 6 a. Chronoamperometric measurements performed at a potential of −0.4 V for 4000 s in an N2 saturated solution containing 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M ethanol ( Fig. 6 b) reveals the stability of the catalyst 10% PdAu NWs. Stability studies are further confirmed by performing the cyclic voltammetry analysis for 500 cycles ( Fig. 7 ). There is not that much reduction in current value and change in onset potential in the case of 10% PdAu catalyst. The current value 2960.40 mA/mgPd reached 2548.88 mA/mgPd and onset potential remained 0.51 V. But for Pd the current value reached almost half of the initial value and the onset potential also shifted to higher value. The initial current value 522.8 mA/mgPd reduced to 274.74 mA/mgPd and onset potential deviated from −0.52 to −0.45 V. Thus, stability of the 10% PdAu NW catalyst has been confirmed. Table 2 displays the catalytic activity of various Pt and PdAu catalysts towards alcohol oxidation. The as synthesized NW catalyst exhibited better activity than that of other different PdAu catalysts [70–78]. The tabulated results on analysis clearly marks that the combination of Pd and Au metals with NW morphology could substantially improve the catalytic activity of Pd due to the superior CO tolerance of Au. One dimensional nano wire with ultrathin diameter and high aspect ratio greatly influenced the catalytic activity. The prepared PdAu NWs have exhibited superior activity than that of pure Pd. The properties associated with the characteristic structure helped to enhance the performance. Blending Au with Pd would facilitate the catalytic activity of Pd. Release of the intermediate CO from active sites of Pd due to the presence of Au can enhance the kinetics of methanol oxidation. Experiments performed revealed the superior catalytic performance of 10% PdAu NWs towards methanol as well as ethanol electro-oxidation. The catalyst is able to perform ten times better activity towards methanol and six times higher activity towards ethanol than pure Pd even by reducing the amount of Pd to 90%. Bifunctional effects of Pd and Au along with the one-dimensional morphology of the synthesized catalyst attributed to the increased catalytic activity towards alcohol oxidation. Alloying of Pd with Au may boost up the kinetic reaction towards the intermediate poison, leading to an enhanced poison tolerance. The unique one-dimensional structure reduces the agglomeration and dissolution of particles and provides large surface area. The improved electron transport characteristics due to the structural anisotropy have facilitated the catalytic efficiency."
7,Conclusions,Au rich PdAu nano wires with different compositions were prepared by simple and speedy method. Well defined ultrathin nano wire morphology was analyzed by TEM analysis. The XRD and XPS analysis was employed to examine the incorporation of Pd and Au. The synthesized catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and stability towards methanol and ethanol oxidation. The catalytic performance shown by 10% Pd incorporated Au wire was superior to other catalysts and pure Pd catalyst. The efficiency of the catalyst enhanced significantly even by reducing the amount of Pd to 90% owing to the unique structural features and bifunctional effects between Au and Pd. Ten times increase in the mass activity towards methanol and six times increment in the mass activity towards ethanol was observed.
