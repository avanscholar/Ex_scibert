0,Introduction,"The lignin-first strategy is currently revisiting the biorefinery concept by maximizing the valorization of lignin in lignocellulosic biomass to obtain valued-added aromatic chemicals and phenolic-rich bio-oil (Li et al., 2015, 2018). Lignin accounts for 20–25 % in lignocellulosic biomass and is a renewable, abundant source of aromatic compounds (Ha et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020). However, a large percentage of lignin is currently burned for the generation of heat, which accentuates the social burden on the environment (Pang et al., 2020; Wang and Wang, 2019). The conversion of lignin derived from the agricultural and industrial wastes into high-value phenolic compounds could both mitigate environmental issues and support the establishment of a biorefinery (Liao et al., 2020; Samec, 2018). Lignin is made up of up to three phenylpropane units, p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units linked together by COC or CC bonds (Rinaldi et al., 2016). The relative amount of these units varies among hardwoods, softwoods and herbaceous biomass (Ragauskas et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014). Due to the recalcitrant structure of technical lignin (e.g. Kraft lignin), high temperatures are often applied for the depolymerization of lignin to obtain phenolic monomers, leading to condensation reactions and the deactivation of catalysts (Dong et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018). In 2015, an emerging “reductive catalytic fractionation” (RCF) strategy based on the “lignin-first” principle was proposed, which could produce a high yield of phenolic monomers and retain carbohydrates in the solid residue simultaneously via a one-pot method (Bosch et al., 2015b; Yan et al., 2008). Microwave heating reduces reaction times and minimizes undesired side reactions compared with conventional heating, hence, has been widely applied in chemical analysis and organic synthesis due to its lower energy-consumption and higher heating efficiency (Fan et al., 2018; Lam et al., 2019a). Despite extensive studies using microwave heating for biomass pre-treatment, there are limited examples of microwave-assisted fractionation and depolymerization of lignin (Rivera et al., 2012). In 2016, Milovanović et al. reported the microwave-assisted deconstruction of lignin using NiO/H-ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts and obtained a highest bio-oil yield (20 wt%) with formic acid as hydrogen-donor and solvent (Milovanović et al., 2016). Duan et al. explored the alcohol-assisted liquefaction of lignin using sulfuric acid as catalyst under microwave conditions. Among these, methanol and ethanol showed higher conversion rates (>80 wt%) when compared with butanol, ethylene glycol and isopropanol (Duan et al., 2018). However, the addition of mineral acids caused equipment corrosion and reduced the carbohydrates retention (Shao et al., 2018; Tayier et al., 2018). Microwave heating takes place via dipolar polarization and ionic conduction, thus an additional microwave receptor should be utilized for the efficient depolymerization of lignin due to its low microwave absorption capacity (Lam et al., 2019b; Zhou et al., 2018a). Alcohol solvents possessed higher microwave absorption abilities than water due to its high polarity (Zhang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018b). Moreover, it was reported that the addition of molecular hydrogen could add to the cost and danger of the process (Jiang et al., 2019; Toledano et al., 2013). As a consequence, the use of polar hydrogen-donating solvents (MeOH, EtOH, iPrOH, BuOH) would be potentially safer and more cost-effective (Cheng et al., 2019; Shafaghat et al., 2020). Birch sawdust (BS) is considered as an industrial and municipal waste mainly from wood processing factories, which was generally discarded and incinerated, thereby posing a high risk of fire and severely contaminating the environment (Yamada and Ono, 1999). Birch wood is widely utilized in making plywood, floor and wooden furniture due to its rigid and robust qualities (Stasiak et al., 2015). However, a large amount of woody wastes are by-products from furniture factories and directly burnt for disposal, which both underutilises its potential high-value of BS and causes severe air pollution (Malins, 2017). Lignin accounted for 16−24 wt% in birch wood and the efficient valorization of the lignin component in BS wastes to obtain value-added phenolic chemicals provides a promising biorefinery strategy (Galkin and Samec, 2016). Furthermore, the separated phenolic monomers could be applied for manufacturing phenol-formaldehyde (PF), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and other phenolic-derived rubbers (Pang et al., 2017). Besides, the defunctionalization and funnelling of phenolic mixtures could produce single phenols, which served as a precursor for the synthesis of industrial products and intermediates and utilized in the domain of industry, pharmacy and agriculture (Ouyang et al., 2020). The further hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived phenols could produce drop-in chemicals (eg. xylene, toluene and benzene), replacing petroleum-based chemicals in modern industrial market via a more sustainable and environmental benign way (Liu et al., 2016). A comparison of reductive catalytic fractionation of lignin in BS was summarized in Table 1 to highlight this study. It has been reported that 23 wt% yield of 4-propenyl guaiacol and 49 wt% yield of 4-propenyl syringol could be obtained from pine and birch wood without external hydrogen in H2O/ethanol co-solvent by Galkin et al., respectively. As discussed by the authors, the hydrogen from the decomposition of formic acid which was generated during the pulping process could promote the hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 bond but not sufficient to hydrogenate the propenyl group (Galkin and Samec, 2014). The same group also explored the hydrogen-free catalytic fractionation of lignin from birch with high S unit content and propyl-G/S were the major products. Hemicellulose was proposed to act as a hydrogen donor for the reductive cleavage of β-O-4 ether bond (Galkin et al., 2016). Klein et al. achieved 32 wt% yield of phenolic monomers from birch with saturated propyl phenols occupying 87.5 %, whereas the detailed mechanism for the production of in-situ hydrogen was not elucidated (Klein et al., 2015). Recently, Ouyang et al. achieved 49 wt% yield of phenolic monomers under a hydrogen-free condition in the mixture of methanol/H2O (1/2, v/v) (Ouyang et al., 2019). However, the high ratio of water and the use of acidic catalyst support (γ-Al2O3) undesirably lowers the retention of hemicellulose. In this work, an appreciable yield of phenolic monomers was obtained at relatively mild conditions (190 °C) whilst simultaneously achieving well retained carbohydrates to promote an integrated biorefinery strategy. Besides, the chemoselectivity of phenolic monomers tuned by varying reaction temperature, reaction time, solvents and catalysts were demonstrated. Overall, the microwave-assisted catalytic reductive depolymerization of lignin in birch sawdust in hydrogen-donor medium could unlock new technology capability and prevent an economic penalty to produce well-defined alkyl or alkenyl phenols from agro-industrial wastes."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Birch wood sawdust was obtained from Weihua Manufacturing Factory in Guangdong Province, China. The birch sawdust used in this work consisted of 37.7 wt% of cellulose (determined as glucan), 16.6 wt% of hemicellulose (determined as xylan, arabinan and galactan), and 23.3 wt% of Klason lignin (acid insoluble lignin). 5 wt% Ru/C, 5 wt% Pd/C, 5 wt% Pt/C catalysts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methanol (HPLC grade), ethanol (HPLC grade), isopropanol (HPLC grade), dichloromethane (HPLC grade), and all phenolic monomers of analytic grade (AR) were obtained from commercial suppliers and used as received."
3,Microwave experiments,"2.2 Microwave experiments The microwave-assisted depolymerization of lignin was performed in a Milestone Flexiwave MA 186 microwave reactor. For each experiment, 1.0 g birch sawdust, 0.1 g catalyst (5 wt% Ru/C, 5 wt% Pd/C, 5 wt% Pt/C) and 40 mL co-solvent (H2O/MeOH, H2O/EtOH, H2O/iPrOH; 3:7, v/v) were added into a 100 mL PTFE (Poly tetra fluoroethylene) vessel, then the vessel was sealed. The mixture was heated with a temperature ramp of 15 min from ambient temperature to desired temperature (150−210 °C) under continuous stirring and a maximum microwave power was 1800 W. After the reaction completed, the vessel was cooled to ambient temperatures, then the vessel was washed with corresponding solvents and the reaction liquid together with the washing solvent was filtered to separate the liquid products and reaction residue. The residue was dried in an oven (105 °C) for 24 h and kept at room temperature for further composition analysis. The aqueous liquid fraction was extracted by dichloromethane (DCM) before GC analysis. The gas was analysed for a given number of experiments detailed as follows: on using a Milestone Synthwave microwave rector, 5.0 g birch sawdust, 0.5 g catalyst (5 wt% Pt/C) and 200 mL of methanol/water (7/3) were added into a 1 L vessel. The microwave reactor was then sealed, purged with nitrogen (3 times) and pressurized to 5 bar. Gas was collected after reaction completion using a gas sampling bag (Supel™). The solid residue and liquid fraction were separated using the work-up procedure mentioned above."
4,Composition analysis of birch sawdust and reaction residues,"2.3 Composition analysis of birch sawdust and reaction residues The composition of birch sawdust and reaction residue was determined according to the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) method “TAPPI T222-om02: acid insoluble lignin in wood and pulp and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) protocol NREL/TP-510−42618: determination of structure carbohydrates and lignin in biomass” (Li et al., 2016). The moisture content of birch sawdust was measured by placing the raw material in an oven at 105 °C until it reached a constant weight. The ash content was obtained by placing the raw material in a muffle furnace, which heats up to 625 °C with 2 h holding time (APHA, 2005). For the analysis of solid residues, 100 mg of raw material was weighed in serum bottle and 1 mL of 72 wt% (w/w) H2SO4 was added. The mixture was placed at 40 °C for 2 h, followed by the addition of 28 mL deionized water. The serum bottle was heated in the autoclave at 121 °C for 1 h and cooled down before the hydrolysate was filtered on porous crucible, which was dried in oven at 105 °C overnight and then weighed. Finally, the crucible was calcined at 500 °C for 6 h to determine the ash content. The Klason lignin (acid insoluble lignin) was calculated by subtracting the weight of ash from the oven-dried solid residue. The hydrolysate was analysed to determine the amount of sugar-derived products. The monosaccharides (glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose), organic acids (acetic acid, formic acid) and carbohydrate degradation products (HMF, furfural) in the hydrolysate were determined on Agilent HPLC and their amounts were converted to equivalent glucan, xylan, arabinan and galactan by multiplying the anhydro correction factor. Cellulose was defined as the total amount of glucan and hemicellulose was regarded as the combination of xylan, arabinan and galactan. Two replicates were performed for each sample with averages and standard deviation determined. (1) Solid residue yield (wt%)= weight of solid residue weight of initial birch sawdust × 100 (2) Conversion of birch sawdust wt % = 100 -solid residue yield (3) Conversion of lignin (wt%)= content of lignin in birch sawdust - content of lignin in solid residue × solid residue yield content of lignin in birch sawdust × 100"
5,Characterization of liquid products,"2.4 Characterization of liquid products The DCM-extracted phase was identified and quantified by GC–MS and GC-FID. The column of GC–MS instrument is a Phenomenex ZB-5MSplus with dimension 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness and the flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The injector temperature was 280 °C and 1 μL of DCM-extracted phase without dilution was injected, and the oven temperature program started at 60 °C for 1 min and increased up to 300 °C at 8 °C min-1. The phenolic monomers in the DCM extract were quantified using Hewlett Packard GC 6890 equipped with Restek Rxi-5HT (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) column and flame ionisation detector. The oven temperature program started at 60 °C for 1 min and increased up to 340 °C at the rate of 8 °C min-1. Injector and detector temperatures were both set at 340 °C. The benzyl alcohol was used as internal standard. The column and refractive index detector temperatures were set at 60 °C and 55 °C, respectively. The yield of phenolic monomers and the selectivity towards specified monomers were calculated by the Equation: Yield of phenolic monomers wt% = weight of phenolic monomers weight of lignin in birch sawdust × 100 Selectivity towards specified monomer % = yield of specified monomer yield of total phenolic monomers × 100 SEC (Size Exclusion Chromatography) was carried out using a set (PSS SDV High) of 3 analytical columns (300 × 8 mm, particle diameter 5 μm) of 1000, 105 and 106 Å pore sizes, plus guard column, supplied by Polymer Standards Service GmbH (PSS) installed in a PSS SECurity SEC system. Elution was with THF at 1 mL/min with a column temperature of 30 °C and detection by refractive index (RI). 20 μL of a 1 mg/mL sample in THF, with a small quantity of toluene added as a flow marker, was injected for each measurement and eluted for 45 min. Calibration was carried out in the molecular weight range 400–2 × 106 g/mol using ReadyCal polystyrene standards supplied by Sigma Aldrich and referenced to the toluene peak. The 1H NMR and two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence (2D HSQC) NMR analyses were conducted to determine the molecular-scale structure of lignin samples. For each test, 50 mg lignin samples were dissolved in 0.5 mL DMSO-d 6. The NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm double resonance broadband BBI inverse probe. The experimental parameters used were 160 transients (scans per block) acquired using 1 K data points in the 1H dimension for an acquisition time of 151 ms and 256 data points in 13C for an acquisition time of 7.68 ms for a total of 16.5 h. For ESI-MS analysis, an aliquot (0.1 mL) of liquid product was diluted further in methanol (1 mL) and injected (1 μL) into an Agilent 1260 infinity liquid chromatograph with a 50:50 methanol/water mobile phase. The analyte was detected using a Bruker Compact time of flight mass spectrometer with internal calibration using sodium formate."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Screening of solvents and catalysts,"3.1 Screening of solvents and catalysts As shown in Fig. 1 , both solvents and catalysts have significant effects on the microwave-assisted depolymerization of lignin. For the control experiment, the highest yield (11.6 wt%) of phenolic monomers was achieved in H2O and methanol co-solvent, with Cγ−OH methylated sinapyl alcohol (S5) being the major product. 4-Propenyl syringol (S4), sinapic aldehyde (S6) and sinapyl alcohol (S7) could also be observed as the minor products, which could be possibly explained by the cracking of Cγ−OH and the oxidation of sinapyl alcohol in this catalytic system with some air present. Besides, the distribution of phenolic monomers could be explained by the etherification of Cγ−OH predominated the reaction pathway over the cleavage of Cγ−OH via hydrogenolysis under catalyst-free conditions, which further substantiated the previous reported works (Huang et al., 2017; Kumaniaev et al., 2017). In the presence of a catalyst, the highest yield of phenolic monomers (28.6 wt%) was achieved in H2O/methanol co-solvent over Pt/C, with 4-propyl syringol (S2, 11.7 wt%) and 4-propenyl syringol (S4, 7.4 wt%) as the major products. 4-Propyl guaiacol (G2, 4.0 wt%) and 4-propenyl guaiacol (G3, 2.4 wt%) were the main products derived from guaiacyl units (Fig. 2 a and Table S1). The lignin component in birch wood, which is a hardwood, contains mainly syringyl (S) units and a small quantity of guaiacyl (G) units, explaining the higher yields of syringyl type units and the absence of p-hydroxyphenyl type units (Bouxin et al., 2015; Jastrzebski et al., 2016). With Pt/C used and H2O/methanol as co-solvent, the selectivity towards propyl-substituted phenolic monomers (G2 + S2) was 54.9 % due to the hydrogenation of the unsaturated side-chain. On the other hand, the Ru/C catalyst gave 20.4 wt% yield of monomers with only 6.4 % selectivity towards G2 (4-propyl guaiacol) and S2 (4-propyl syringol), which implied the lower hydrogenation activity of Ru/C compared with Pd/C and Pt/C in this solvent system. In H2O and ethanol co-solvent, the Pd/C catalyst provided a higher yield of phenolic monomers (22.8 wt%) than Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts (both at 16.9 wt%). Moreover, higher selectivity (60.1 %) towards (G2 + S2) was obtained compared with that of Pt/C (56.8 %) and Ru/C (1.9 %) (Fig. 2b and Table S2). However, only unsaturated 4-propenyl syringol was obtained with Pd/C used from birch in Samec’s work, which was different from the monomer distribution in this work (Galkin and Samec, 2014). In H2O and isopropanol co-solvent, the lowest yield (11.8 wt%) of phenolic monomers was obtained for Pd/C catalyst. More surprisingly is the absence of hydrogenation activity of the Pd/C catalyst in isopropanol leading to low selectivity (1.7 %) towards saturated propyl-substituted phenols (Fig. 2c and Table S3). On the other hand, the Ru/C catalyst only showed hydrogenation activity in the presence of H2O/isopropanol co-solvent. Compared with the work conducted by Schutyseret al., propanol-substituted guaiacol/syringol were the major products with external hydrogen (30 bar) added (Schutyser et al., 2015). The exact reason for the discrepancies between this study and the work reported by Schutyseret al. could be ascribed to the fact that high pressure (>10 bar) of hydrogen favour the hydrogenation of side-chain double bond while inhibited the hydrogenolysis of Cγ−OH (Renders et al., 2018). To conclude, the Pt/C catalyst can effectively promote the hydrogenolysis of lignin-derived oligomers and the hydrogenation of unsaturated side-chain to obtain propyl-substituted phenolic monomers in the three H2O-alcohol co-solvents; the Pd/C catalyst could facilitate the hydrogenation of side-chain propenyl in H2O/methanol and H2O/ethanol co-solvent; whereas, the Ru/C catalyst could only promote the hydrogenation of propenyl side-chain to obtain propyl-substituted monomers in the presence of H2O/isopropanol. The differences of interactions between catalysts and solvents needs to be further elucidated in future work. The molecular weight could be used to determine the depolymerization degree of lignin, which was shown in Table 2 and Fig. S1. In the three co-solvent system, noble metal supported on activated carbon catalysts (Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C) could reduce the weight-average molecular weight (Mw), among which Pd and Pt showed the most prominent molecular reduction to 536 and 586 g/mol in H2O/MeOH co-solvent. For H2O/EtOH and H2O/iPrOH co-solvents, the liquid products showed higher weight-average molecular weight and number-average molecular weight than that of H2O/MeOH under the same catalytic conditions, which agreed well with the higher monomer yield in H2O/MeOH co-solvent. The elution curves (Fig. S1a-c) of catalytic liquid products exhibited a shift to low-molecular weight oligomers and monomers. The 1H NMR spectra of liquid products obtained with or without catalyst was shown in Fig. 3 , which can be divided into side-chain (0.5−3 ppm) and aromatic regions (6–7.5 ppm). For the blank liquid, the main signal was from the methoxy group at 3.7 ppm. The peaks observed at 2.45 and 1.1 ppm in the liquid catalyzed by Pt and Pd catalysts could be attributed to the Hα and Hβ in the ethyl-substituted phenolics, which accords with the ethyl guaiacol (G1) and ethyl syringol (S1) products in the Pt and Ru-catalyzed liquids (Raikwar et al., 2019). The peaks at 2.41, 1.5, 0.9 ppm assigned to Hα, Hβ and Hγ of propyl-substituted phenolics were observed in liquids with Pt and Pd used, which also confirmed the production of 4-propyl guaiacol (G2) and 4-propyl syringol (S2) (Bosch et al., 2015a). In the aromatic region, more intensive peaks associated with G2,5,6 and S2,6 at 6.6 and 6.4 ppm could be observed in the liquids with Pt and Pd applied (Singh et al., 2014). To summarize, all the proton signals of 1H NMR spectra corresponded well with the distribution of phenolic monomers. The side-chain region (δ C/δ H 50–90/2.5–5.0) and aromatic region (δ C/δ H 100–150/6.0–8.0) in the 2D HSQC NMR spectra of liquid products with and without catalysts were depicted in Fig. 4 . In the aromatic region, signal peaks assigned to S2,6 (104.0/6.7), S’2,6 (106.3/7.3), G2 (110.8/7.0), G5 (114.5/6.7), G6 (119.0/6.8) could be clearly observed for the control liquid products (Wen et al., 2013). These signal peaks associated with G and S units became more intense with the catalysts used due to the release of the guaiacol and syringol-derived monomers from the oligomers. In the side-chain region, the methoxy group at 56.4/3.7 could be clearly observed for the liquid products with and without catalysts. The other signals could be ascribed to the four main substructures of lignin in birch wood, including β-O-4 (A), phenylcoumaran (B), resinol (C) and cinnamyl alcohol (I). The signal assigned to Aγ (59.9/3.4–3.8) decreased with the catalysts used, while the cross peaks of Aα (71.8/4.9) and Aβ (85.8/4.1) totally disappeared, which collectively confirmed the effective cleavage of β-O-4 linkages with the three catalysts (Río et al., 2012). No significant changes for the signals assigned to B (Bβ, Bγ) and C (Cα, Cβ, Cγ) structures was observed, possibly due to the higher bond dissociation energy of β-5 and β-β bonds in B and C structures (Lou et al., 2017). Besides, the absence of cinnamyl alcohol (I) substructure could explain the formation of propyl-substituted monomers via the breakage of Cγ−OH and the hydrogenation of Cα=Cβ bonds. In order to get some insights into the molecular weight distribution and the molecular weight of monomers and oligomers, the ESI-MS spectra were shown in Fig. 5 . For the m/z range of 150–300, the main peaks can be ascribed to the hydrogen and sodium adducts of phenolic monomers. For the control experiment, the most intensive peak at m/z of 247.06 was ascribed to [S5+Na]+, and the other three peaks assigned to the hydrogen or sodium ion adduct of S4, S6 and S7, in agreement with the distribution of phenolic monomers detected by GC. For the Pd and Pt-catalyzed liquid products, the strongest peak at m/z of 219.09 was assigned to [S2+Na]+; whereas the most intensive peak corresponded to [S4+Na]+ was at m/z 217.08. To summarize, the mass peaks in the range of 150–300 are in accordance with the hydrogen or sodium adducts of phenolic monomers. The oligomers (mainly dimers, trimers, tetramers) could be observed in the mass range of 300−1000. The significant changes for the catalytic liquid products was the decrease of signal assigned to oligomers compared with control liquid, which further confirmed the efficient depolymerization of lignin. The proposed depolymerization mechanism of lignin-derived oligomers will be discussed in 3.4."
8,Optimization of reaction parameters,"3.2 Optimization of reaction parameters After comparing the effect of solvents and catalysts, the H2O/methanol co-solvent and Pt/C catalyst were chosen to further optimize other reaction parameters (reaction temperature, time, solvent ratio, catalyst loading). The degree of delignification increased from 2.3–29.1 wt% when the temperature increased from 150 to 170 °C (Fig. 6 a). However, a 1.1 wt% yield of phenolic monomers was obtained at 150 °C and only 4.5 wt% of monomers yield at 170 °C, suggesting that most of the extracted lignin fragments remained in an oligomeric form. At 180 °C, the delignification only increased to 32.3 wt% while phenolic monomer yield increased to 20.0 wt%, showing that the kinetics of lignin depolymerization significantly increased at 180 °C. The monomer yield continued to increase at 190 °C, reaching 28.6 wt% while the delignification increased to 43.8 wt% However, the monomer yield grew steadily to 30.1 wt% when the temperature reached 200 °C with only a slight increase of delignification to 46.9 wt.%. The selectivity towards propyl-substituted phenols (G2 + S2) hovered around 15 % in the temperature range of 150−180 °C, and surged to 54.9 % at 190 °C, reaching the maximum at 67.4 % when the temperature increased to 200 °C, which suggested increasing to 190 °C could highly promote the hydrogenation of unsaturated side-chain in the phenolic monomers. The phenolic products shifted from propenyl-substituted phenolic monomers to propyl-substituted monomers at 190 °C (Fig. S2), which was also observed in the work conducted by the group of Hensen and Samec (Galkin et al., 2016; Ouyang et al., 2019). The effect of reaction time on the delignification and distribution of phenolic monomers was also investigated, as shown in Fig. 6b and Table S5. Both the yield of phenolic monomers and selectivity towards (G2 + S2) increased steadily over prolonged reaction time from 0.5 h to 6 h. The delignification of lignin initially increased from 22.8 wt% to 44.5 wt% during 0.5–2 h with the yield of phenolic monomers increasing from 5.4 wt% to 16.7 wt%, which indicated that the lignin dissolution and extraction mainly occurred during the first 2 h. This could also be confirmed by the increase of molecular weight from 602 to 662 g/mol during 0.5−2 h (Table 3 ). The yield of phenolic monomers grew significantly to 28.6 wt% at 3 h though the delignification degree slightly decreased, demonstrating that the stage (2−3 h) was dominantly the depolymerization/hydrogenolysis of the lignin-derived oligomers released from the first delignification process, which agreed well with the decrease of molecular weight after 2 h. The conversion of lignin slightly decreased for 3–6 h possibly due to the condensation of some unstable and reactive intermediates, whereas the yield of phenolic monomers increased steadily to 36.9 wt%. It is surprisingly observed that the selectivity towards propyl-substituted monomers (G2 + S2) rose constantly from 22.2 % to reach a high point of 90.0 % during 2–6 h. which indicated that the hydrogenation of side-chain propenyl group was favourable at longer reaction time. It can be induced that the in-situ hydrogen produced first promote the hydrogenolysis of inter-unit linkages of lignin and then hydrogenate the unsaturated side-chain of phenolics. The solvent ratio also influenced the delignification degree and distribution of phenolic monomers, as shown in Fig. 6c and Fig. S3. The yield of phenolic monomers was only 1.1 wt% and 8.4 wt % in pure H2O and pure methanol solvent with the low delignification degree of 6.7 wt% and 14.7 wt%, respectively. The yield surged to 28.6 wt% with the volume ratio 3/7 of H2O/methanol (Table S6), where the delignification was 43.8 wt%. This is consistent with the previous work reporting the effect of solvent ratio on the delignification and depolymerization of lignin (Kumaniaev et al., 2017; Renders et al., 2016). Though the ratio 1/1 of H2O/methanol could achieve slightly higher conversion (46.3 wt%) of lignin, the yield of monomers was 22.8 wt%, which was conversely lower than that at the ratio 1/1. The addition of more water (H2O/methanol ratio of 10/0 and7/3) decreased both the delignification degree and the yield of phenolic monomers. Fig. 6d depicted the effect of catalyst loading on the yield and distribution of phenolic monomers. The yield of phenolic monomers increased substantially from 10.3 wt% to 28.6 wt% when the loading of catalyst (5% Pt/C) grew up from 0.05 g to 0.10 g (Table S7). When catalyst was further added to 0.15 g, the yield levelled off around 29.0 wt%. However, the yield dropped to 21.3 wt% as the catalyst amount reached 0.20 g, signifying that the excessive amount of catalyst could partially inhibit the hydrogenolysis of lignin. In order to collect and analysis the gas composition and increase the temperature to reduce reaction time, the microwave depolymerization was also conducted on Synthwave reactor. As shown in Table 4 , an increase of reaction temperature to 210 °C (29.2 wt%) for 1 h gave an equal yield to that at 190 °C (28.6 wt%) and 200 °C (30.1 wt%) for 3 h. The selectivity towards propyl-G/S (G2 + S2) at 210 °C (23.5 %) was much lower than that at 190 °C (54.9 %) and 200 °C (67.4 %), which indicated the shorter reaction time (1 h) could not achieve more hydrogenation of the side-chain of phenolic monomers. This further substantiated only unsaturated propenyl syringol was achieved under the similar reaction condition (195 °C, 1 h) (Galkin and Samec, 2014), which could be explained by the hydrogenation of side-chain of phenolics was more time-dependent due to the slow decomposition of methanol (this work) /ethanol (Samec’s work) to produce in-situ hydrogen or the priority of H2 consumption for the hydrogenolysis reaction at a low pressure (Bernas et al., 2008). The gaseous products were analysed on GC-TCD, as shown in Fig. 7 and Table 5 . No hydrogen were detected in the solvent system without Pt/C catalyst. Small amounts of CO2 were measured and could be explained by the decarboxylation of the biomass (Chen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). However, H2 could be detected in the gaseous products of H2O/methanol co-solvent catalyzed by Pt/C. The volume percentage of H2 was 6.6 % without birch sawdust, which was five times larger than that (1.3 %) with birch sawdust. It can be deduced that the hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation of lignin in birch sawdust consumed the hydrogen produced in this catalytic co-solvent system or the presence of biomass could inhibit the catalytic activity of Pt/C. The decomposition of methanol could produce H2 with or without H2O via two different routes (shown in Scheme 1 ) (Bossola et al., 2019; McClelland et al., 2019). However, only a tiny amount of CO or CO2 were observed, indicating that H2 produced was mainly from the decomposition of methanol instead of methanol reforming which could be thermodynamically favourable at higher temperature (250−320 °C) (Barta et al., 2010; Bernt et al., 2018)."
9,The fate of carbohydrates during RCF of lignin,"3.3 The fate of carbohydrates during RCF of lignin As shown in Table S12, the birch sawdust is mainly composed of glucan, xylan and lignin, while arabinan, galactan and acid soluble lignin are only present in small quantities. After the pre-treatment in H2O/alcohol co-solvents, more than 90 wt% of cellulose could be retained in the reaction residues (Table 6 ). The effect of reaction temperature and time on the conversion of birch sawdust and three components were also investigated in H2O/methanol (3:7; v/v) (Table S13-S14). The conversion of birch sawdust, cellulose and hemicellulose all increased as the temperature increased from 150 to 200 °C, with the removal of hemicellulose reaching 46.9 wt% at 200 °C (Fig. 8 a). The conversion of cellulose hovered around 10 wt% though the temperature increased. The removal of cellulose was below 10 wt% at different reaction time, while that of hemicellulose constantly increased to 51.0 wt% at 6 h (Fig. 8b). For H2O/methanol co-solvents, 42.7 wt% of hemicellulose could be converted. After treatment in H2O/methanol co-solvent, the amount of glucan increased from 37.7 wt% to 55.4 wt% due to the removal of lignin and hemicellulose. As shown in Fig. 8c and Table 6, only 6.7 wt% of lignin could be removed in pure H2O solvent, however, high conversion of hemicellulose (91.4 wt%) could be achieved due to the cleavage of ether and ester linkages between lignin and hemicellulose (Yu et al., 2020). As for pure methanol, only 1.5 wt% of hemicellulose could be removed. Overall, the conversion of hemicellulose decreased as the volume percentage of H2O dropped. The sugar-derived products were also analysed by HPLC (Table S8−11). For the liquid products under different reaction times and temperatures, the mass of acetic acid constantly increased due to the deacetylation of acetyl groups of hemicellulose. No formic acid was detected, possibly due to its decomposition in this catalytic system. It has been reported that acetyl groups accounted for 3−5 wt% while the formyl groups rarely exist in hardwood’s composition (Graça et al., 2018), whereas the formic acid could be produced from the decomposition of hemicellulose-derived furfural products. As the effect of solvent ratio on the distribution of sugar-derived products, the acetic acid showed a decreasing trend due to the lower conversion of hemicellulose. For pure methanol, no glucose and xylose were detected, which further confirmed that the removal of (hemi)cellulose could be highly promoted by the addition of H2O (He et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2018). The catalyst loading showed less effect on the distribution of sugar-derived products, which could explain that the removal of (hemi)cellulose was mainly influenced by the solvent system."
10,Proposed depolymerization mechanism,"3.4 Proposed depolymerization mechanism As shown in Fig. 5, the mass peak of monomers and low-molecular-weight oligomers could be observed, therefore a possible catalytic hydrogenolysis mechanism of four typical oligomers to produce major propyl- and propenyl- substituted phenols was proposed (Fig. 9 ). Trimer OG-3 (m/z=552.23) was degraded to a dimer (OG-1, m/z=360.15) and Cγ−OH etherified coniferyl alcohol. The dimer OG-1 suffered difficulty from further depolymerization due to high bond dissociation energy of β−5 bond (125.2–127.6 kcal/mol) (Mei et al., 2019), while γ−OH etherified monomer underwent hydrogenolysis to produce monomer G3, which was further hydrogenated to obtain G2 with saturated side-chain. A trimer (OG-4, m/z=610.24) with α-O-4 and β-5 intramolecular linkage was observed to go through a similar hydrogenolysis pathway. Trimer OG-5 (m/z=626.27) with β-O-4 linkages was depolymerized to monomers S5 and G4, which further experienced the hydrogenolysis of γ-OMe and γ−OH and side-chain hydrogenation to obtain monomers S2 and G2. Tetramers OG-6 with m/z of 722.33 also showed the cleavage of β-O-4 bonds, hydrogenolysis of γ−OH and selective hydrogenation of side-chain."
11,Practical implications of this study: challenges and recommendations,"3.5 Practical implications of this study: challenges and recommendations (1) Since this work was conducted in a laboratory-based microwave reactor, the heat and mass transfer in the application of a substantially larger microwave reactor should be considered to unlock the potential of industrial scalability. (2) The catalyst and solvent screening for tuning the chemoselectivity of phenolic monomers was observed in this work, which could be further elucidated to better illuminate the catalytic transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis mechanism in future work. (3) The catalytic hydrogenolysis of lignin promoted by the in-situ hydrogen from the decomposition of alcohol solvents should be highly prioritized due to its economic benefit and low risk since hydrogen transportation and storage increased the economic costs and risk of hazards. (4) The carbohydrate retention should be equally considered with the yield of phenolic monomers in terms of an integrated biorefinery strategy. To achieve the fullest utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, both appreciable yield of phenolic monomers and high carbohydrates retention should be desirably achieved based on “lignin-first” biorefinery protocol."
12,Conclusions,"The microwave-assisted depolymerization of lignin in birch sawdust to phenolic monomers without external hydrogen has been developed. 65.3 wt% yield of phenolic monomers was obtained based on the delignification degree (43.8 wt%). 42.7 wt% of xylan could be extracted in H2O/MeOH (3:7, v/v) co-solvent, while 92.0 wt% of glucan were retained. The distribution of phenolic monomers could be tuned by varying different catalysts and solvents. In-situ hydrogen from the decomposition of methanol promoted the catalytic hydrogenolysis of lignin and selective hydrogenation of unsaturated side-chain in phenolic monomers. Molecular weight variations substantiated the excellent catalytic ability for the hydrogenolysis of lignin to low-molecular weight oligomers and monomers. 2D HSQC NMR confirmed the breakage of β-O-4 linkages and the more stable C-C (β-β, β-5) linkages in resinol and phenylcoumaran structures. A possible catalytic hydrogenolysis mechanism was also proposed based on ESI-MS spectra."
