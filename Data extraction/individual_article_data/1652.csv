0,Introduction,"Biotechnological processes offer an economic and versatile way to transform resources from wastewater into valuable products, which is a prerequisite for the development of a cradle-to-cradle bio-based economy [1]. Several technologies are considered to convert organic matter to bioenergy, such as biohydrogen, biodiesel, bioethanol, and microbial fuel cell technology. Hydrogen as a clean energy carrier is receiving much attention nowadays due to the depletion of natural resources, particularly fossil fuels. Although the current biohydrogen yields are low, recent achievements in biotechnology and genetic engineering allow us to expect a rapid increase in amount of generated H2 [2]. Biological H2 production can be both autotrophic (biophotolysis) and heterotrophic (dark and photofermentation). Dark fermentation of wastes with concomitant H2 production has been reported for a long time and is quite topical (see for example, [3,4]). Photofermentation is carried out by purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB), 1 1 PNSB, purple nonsulfur bacteria; DWW, distillery wastewater; BOD, biochemical oxygen demand; COD, chemical oxygen demand; VFAs, volatile fatty acids; BChl, bacteriochlorophyll; PhBR. photobioreactor. which use light as an energy source and various organic compounds as electron and carbon sources. There are numerous examples of their application in treatment of various wastewater (domestic, sago starch processing, sardine processing, production of tofu, soybean, olive mill etc) reviewed by Keskin et al. [5]. The growth of PNSB resulted in the improvement of wastewater quality and even in H2 production thus providing the cheap energy source [5,6]. One of the most abundant organic containing wastes is the distillery wastewater (DWW) generated from alcohol distilleries. Ethanol distillery is a very energy consuming process. Besides, an estimated 8–15L of DWW is generated per 1L of alcohol produced [7]. The increasing generation of DWW brings about the environmental pollution problems. Thus, the treatment of DWW with a possibility of energy recovery is a vital task. DWW is characterized by high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at 50–60g/L and chemical oxygen demand (COD) at 110–190g/L. It also contains inorganic N, P, K, Ca, and S compounds [8]. A number of physicochemical and biological approaches (or their combinations) to address this issue was reviewed by Mohana et al. [8].The possibility of DWW processing with simultaneous H2 production appears to be particularly promising. The dark anaerobic DWW fermentation was studied in several works. Mixed microbial cultures at mesophilic temperature of 37.5°C were used in fermentation of DWW in sequential batch cycles [9]. Vatsala et al. [10] demonstrated dark fermentation of DWW by mixed culture of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Rhodopseudomonas palustris in large-scale (up to 100m3) process. The reported H2 yield was 2.76mol/mol glucose [10]. DWW was also used in light-dependent growth of PNSB or even H2 production [11–14]. To meet the requirements for nitrogenase synthesis, the C/N ratio in DWW must be appropriate. However, the complex nature of wastes does not allow to estimate this parameter because it is difficult to reveal all the particular C- and N-compounds utilizable by purple bacteria. The necessity to dilute DWW before processing depends on initial COD. Most often, 5–50% DWW concentration was used in batch process. Apart from monocultures of PNSB, there is a study with hybrid one-stage photofermentation where inoculum contained both anaerobic and photosynthetic consortia [12]. This process was performed as a cyclic one with a regular substrate addition. The cumulative hydrogen production was∼1.5L/L of reactor, the removal of COD and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was 56 and 63%, respectively. Unfortunately, there was a need to replenish PNSB at regular intervals. Photofermentation as a second step, after dark fermentation, in sequential process of different wastes treatment was explored quite extensively (see for example, [15,16]). In this case the by-products of the first stage become substrates for the second stage and in total, it is possible to get the theoretical value 12mol H2 per mole of glucose with simultaneous waste purification [17,18]. The key point is that each stage can be performed at a highest rate under specific optimal conditions. The application of this method for DWW treatment has not been reported yet. A goal of the current study was to estimate the microbial treatment of distillery wastewater by dark fermentation, photofermentation, and integrated two-stage process in terms of energy production (as H2) and concomitant waste purification."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacteria and media,"2.1 Bacteria and media The dark anaerobic saccharolytic consortium was obtained from silage pit liquid and cultivated at 37°C as described before [19,20]. The purple non-sulfur bacteria Rhodobacter capsulatus B10 and R. sphaeroides B-3059 (previously described as strain N7 [21]) were grown on Ormerod medium with ammonium sulfate and lactate at 30°C, light intensity 30W/m2. For the short-term experiments, bacteria were grown on lactate-containing Ormerod medium with ammonium limitation (2mM NH4 +)."
3,DWW treatment,"2.2 DWW treatment The samples of DWW were supplied by distillery plants in Kashira and Vladikavkaz (Russia) (Cristall OJSC). DWW pretreatment included neutralization to pH 6.7 with KOH, centrifugation at 5000rpm and sterilization. Then, DWW composition was analyzed and samples were tested as substrates for photofermentation or dark fermentation."
4,Dark fermentation of DWW,"2.3 Dark fermentation of DWW Dark anaerobic fermentation of DWW (0.25L) was carried out under batch operation in 0.50-L capped glass vials under N2 gas phase at 37°C using above mentioned consortium (inoculum volume 0.5%). The pH value was maintained above 5.0 by daily titrations with 50% KOH. Gas production was measured manometrically. When gas production stopped, the culture medium was treated similarly to initial DWW. The resulting effluent was further utilized as pre-fermented DWW (DWWf)."
5,Photofermentation of DWW or DWWf,"2.4 Photofermentation of DWW or DWWf Photofermentation of the initial DWW or pre-fermented DWWf was also referred to as long-term H2 photoproduction (5-7days). It was carried out in vials of total volume 30 or 500mL (10 or 250mL of culture, respectively) under the Ar gas phase with mixing. The 300-mL vials were also referred to as photobioreactors (PhBRs). Cultivation temperature was 30°С, incident light intensity 30W/m2. Two species of PNSB, R. capsulatus B10 or R. sphaeroides B-3059, were used as an inoculum (5%). The gas production in PhBRs was recorded by gas-water displacement. The gas production in 30-mL vials was measured manometrically. The H2 percentage in gas was determined by GC [22]."
6,Short-term H2 photoproduction,"2.5 Short-term H2 photoproduction Short-term (≤2h) H2 production from DWW was performed in 15-mL vials (2mL of culture) under Ar gas phase at 30°С, incident light intensity 30W/m2. H2 production was followed by GC as described above."
7,Other analytical methods,"2.6 Other analytical methods The concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate and isobutyrate were determined by gas chromatography as described earlier [22]. Lactate concentrations were determined by an enzymatic method [23]. Bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 772nm after extraction in 7:2 (v/v) acetone:methanol mixture [24]. The total content of soluble saccharides was measured using anthrone reagent after hydrolysis by sulfuric acid and presented as glucose equivalents [25]. The ammonium content was analyzed by microdiffusion method [26]. Protein concentration was estimated according to Lowry method. COD was measured by potassium dichromate method. All results represent the mean value of three experiments±95% confidence interval."
8,Calculation of H2 production efficiency,"2.7 Calculation of H2 production efficiency The efficiency of hydrogen production (VFAs and glucose transformation into H2) was calculated as the ratio of the actual H2 production to the theoretical hydrogen production. The latter was calculated assuming that all utilized VFAs (acetate, lactate, butyrate) and glucose can be converted to H2 according to known stoichiometry: C2H4O2 +2H2O→4H2 +2CO2 C3H6O3 +3H2O→6H2 +3CO2 C4H8O2 +6H2O→10H2 +4CO2 C6H12O6 +6H2O→12H2 +6CO2."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Some properties of two DWW samples,"3.1 Some properties of two DWW samples Two samples of DWW were supplied from different distillery plants (Section 2.2). The composition of these samples was similar: soluble saccharides (glucose residues) ∼5–6g/L, protein ∼3–5g/L, total VFAs∼19–24mM (mainly lactate) (Table 1 ). There were only traces of ammonium but perceptible amounts of protein. Excess of ammonium is often a problem for photofermentation of different wastes if the process aims to H2 production [5], but it was not a case when using DWW. However, the presence of proteins (amino acids) and some other N-compounds could influence nitrogenase expression as well. COD in DWW2 was about 40g/L. Given the data in Table 1, one can estimate the theoretical H2 production (yield) by PNSB on the base of known stoichiometry (see Section 2.7). The theoretical H2 production from VFAs is 2.4 or 3.5L per 1L of DWW1 or DWW2, respectively. In addition, glucose equivalents could provide 8.2 or 9.5L per 1L of DWW1 or DWW2, respectively. However, the precise chemical composition of anthrone-reactive substances (glucose equivalents) in DWW is unknown. It is unclear whether they are suitable as electron donors for H2 production by PNSB. Besides, some other VFAs (not detected by our method) could play role. Thus, the efficiency of DWW utilization should be estimated by experimental tests on short-term and long-term H2 production."
11,Growth of R. capsulatus B10 using DWW1,"3.2 Growth of R. capsulatus B10 using DWW1 The preliminary screening demonstrated that R. capsulatus B10 was able to grow over the wide range of DWW1 concentrations from 20 to 100%. Even the 100% DWW1 did not arrest the growth. Thus, DWW1 contained all the necessary macro- and microelements for PNSB growth. However, when using diluted 20% DWW1, some growth stimulation was observed on addition of Mg, Fe and phosphates (not shown). Cultivation of purple bacteria on DWW has already been demonstrated at low DDW concentration: growth of R. sphaeroides O.U.001 was maximal at 10% DWW with COD 19.8g/L after dilution [11], Rhodopseudomonas HY21 could grow using DWW with COD 2.6g/L without dilution [13]."
12,Short-term H2 production using DWW1,"3.3 Short-term H2 production using DWW1 For short-term experiments (<8h) we used R. capsulatus B10 preliminary grown under NH4 + limitation (Section 2.1). Bacteria were capable of H2 production during growth but H2 production rate gradually decreased to zero due to exhaustion of lactate. This point on growth curve was chosen for the start of short-term experiments, which demonstrated the restoration of H2 production after DWW1 addition. It means that DWW1 appears to be a suitable substrate for H2 production. The initial rates of H2 production were maximal even at 0.5% DWW1, so this concentration was saturating (Fig. 1 , Curves 1, 2). The specific H2 yield in short-term experiments amounted to 7.5-8.5L/L of DWW1 at concentrations 1–5% DWW1. This yield was higher than theoretical H2 yield expected from utilization of VFAs (Section 3.1). Thus, some other substrates were used for H2 photoproduction in addition to indicated VFAs (Section 3.1). The H2 production from DWW1 was characterized by lag-period increasing with DWW1 concentration (Fig. 1A, Curve 3). At >20% DWW1 the complete inhibition of H2 production was observed (during at least the 1.5h period). This lag-period was probably conditioned by reversible inactivation of nitrogenase similar to switch-off by ammonium [27]."
13,Utilization of non-treated DWW1 for long-term Н2 photoproduction in batch PhBR with R. capsulatus B10,"3.4 Utilization of non-treated DWW1 for long-term Н2 photoproduction in batch PhBR with R. capsulatus B10 Experiments were done as described in Section 2.4. DWW1 was diluted with distilled water and supplied with MgSO4, FeSO4 and K-phosphate buffer (See Section 3.2). Unlike to short-term experiments, at 5% DWW1, H2 production was not observed. At 10–60% DWW1 the H2 yield per 1L of culture amounted to 1.2L which equaled to ∼2L per 1L of non-treated DWW1 (Fig. 2 A). This was far below the H2 yield in short-term experiments. To characterize the growth of R. capsulatus B10, the BChl and dry weight concentrations were determined at different DWW1 concentrations (Fig. 2B). The growth was linearly dependent on DWW1 concentration over the range 10–40%. Above 40% DWW1, the BChl and dry weight concentration did not increase further. It should be emphasized that H2 yield in long-term experiments in PhBR was far below than in short-term experiments: 2 and 8L/L DWW1, respectively. It was conditioned by inevitable expenditure of substrates for bacterial growth along with H2 production (Fig. 2B) [see also reference 28]. However, there is a way to improve H2 photoproduction by preliminary transformation of glucose equivalents during dark fermentation stage into utilizable VFAs. Furthermore, to have a chance of processing the high-concentration DWW, we searched for more tolerant PNSB strain. As it was shown earlier, R. sphaeroides B-3059 was resistant to NaCl (up to 30g/L) and K-P buffer (up to 20g/L). Besides that, this bacterium has a high H2 production activity [21]. Hence, this strain was applied in the following study."
14,Utilization of DWW for H2 production in two-stage process consisting of dark fermentation and photofermentation,"3.5 Utilization of DWW for H2 production in two-stage process consisting of dark fermentation and photofermentation 3.5.1 Dark fermentation DWW was fermented by dark anaerobic consortium as described in Section 2.3. Gas production continued about 7days and the maximal rate of H2 production was observed at 2–3days (Fig. 3 ). The yield of H2 equaled to 0.8 or 1.6L/L DWW1 or DWW2, correspondingly (Table 2 ). During fermentation, the sugar was consumed completely, and VFAs were produced. Their concentration increased from ∼20 to 67–112mM (Tables 1, 2). The main VFAs were butyrate and acetate, which is in accordance with stoichiometry of butyric acid fermentation: 1 glucose→2–4H2 +0-1 butyrate+0-2 acetate. However, when using bacterial consortia, a competition is possible between various metabolic routes hence several fermentation types take place simultaneously. For example, in our study the DWW2f showed unusually high lactate content (Table 2). The concentration of protein in both DWWs after dark fermentation (DWWf) decreased compared with initial DWW (Tables 2 and 1). However, the NH4 + content slightly increased due to protein fermentation. Nonetheless, this concentration is quite low to cause a prolonged repression of nitrogenase synthesis. Dark fermentation was carried out both with addition of main macroelements or without it. Results were close in these experiments (not shown). It means that DWW contained all the necessary elements for fermentation process. The DWWf was treated as above mentioned (Section 2.2) and then was used as a substrate for H2 photoproduction by PNSB. COD in DWW2f was∼37g/L. According to Chandra [12] dark fermentation of DDW showed COD removal efficiency of 18% at the 12th h, which increased further with each working cycle and amounted to 56.8% at 60th h, i.e. adaptation of culture led to improvement of results. COD reduction by 40% was demonstrated in 100m3 dark reactor, but the COD in the final effluent was still as high as 58.9g/L [10]. 3.5.2 Photofermentation In short-term experiments with DWW1f, the H2 production by R. capsulatus B10 increased from 8L/L (Fig. 2A) to 10–12L/L (not shown). However, the inhibition of growth and hydrogen production in long-term experiments took place at 20% DWW1f and higher (not shown). Another strain, R. sphaeroides B-3059, grew well over a wide range of DWW2f concentrations (Table 3 ). The biomass dry weight and BChl concentrations increased linearly over the range 10 − 40% DWW2f. Further, the dependence became non-linear, and at 100% DWW2f, the growth was partly inhibited though still possible. The theoretical H2 yield calculated on the basis of VFAs available appeared to be 12.6 or 20.9L per 1L of fermented DWW1f or DWW2f, respectively. Thus, this parameter increased 5–6 times due to fermentation. The real long-term photofermentation by R. sphaeroides B-3059 at low-scale level gave H2 yield up to 3.1L/L of culture (at 40% DWW2f) or up to 12L/L of DWW2f (at 20% DWW2f) (Table 3). At DWW2f concentration above 40% the H2 yield decreased due to possible light limitation [28]. To choose the optimal dilution of DWWf, we must take into account another important factor besides H2 yield, namely the residual concentration of VFAs and other components in the effluent, i.e. purity level. In our experiment, we observed the lack of sugars in the effluent at any concentration of DWWf (not shown). At DWW2f ≤40% the residual concentration of VFAs was negligible (Fig. 4 A), which means the complete consumption of VFAs. At >40% DWW2f the residual VFA concentrations increased, and the percentage of VFA utilization decreased (Fig. 4A, B) thus decreasing purification level. The maximal efficiency of VFA transformation into H2 (calculated in accordance with description in Section 2.7) amounted to 60% when using 20% DWW2f. At higher concentration of DWW2f, the efficiency dropped down to 12%. This means that at higher DWW concentrations VFAs were predominantly used not for H2 production but for biomass/biopolymer synthesis. Similar observation was made in photofermentation of potato fermentation effluent and discussed earlier [28]. 3.5.3 The upscaling of photofermentation step To approach the practice, laboratory studies should provide the high H2 yield and high purification efficiency in large-scale reactors and in long-term processes. The example of large-scale (100m3), dark fermentation of DWW with H2 yield 2.76mol/mol glucose, was presented by Vatsala [10]. However, it was a batch process, which continued ∼40h. In contrast, the cyclic, prolonged (∼25days), one–stage photofermentation by mixed culture, was reported by Chandra [12]. In this case, the volume of culture was 180mL, the H2 yield 1.5L/L culture. The pivotal factor for such a mixed culture was pH value. The pH maintenance is necessary to provide a high H2 yield in mixed cultures as it was shown recently [29,30]. We tried to scale up photofermentation stage by changing the total volume of vials from 30mL to 500mL as a first upscaling step. The volume of culture increased from 10 to 250mL (25 times). The light path was quite similar (4cm) in both cases. However, the surface-to-volume ratio decreased from 2.2 to 0.8cm−1. In 500-mL vials, the H2-production phase continued ∼5days (Fig. 5 ), thereafter the H2 consumption was observed. The maximal rate of H2 production at ∼2nd day was 28mL/hL of culture. Note that in this case the diluted DWW2f was supplied with some macroelements (see Section 3.2). In low-scale experiments, we showed that these additions improved H2 yield to 16L/L DWW2 and the efficiency of VFAs to H2 conversion by ∼25% (Table 4 ). On the upscaling step, the H2 yield was 2.0L/L of culture or 9.9L/L DWW2f (Table 4). As compared to low-scale photofermentation, after scaling up the H2 yield decreased by ∼38%. All the organic acids were consumed in both cases but efficiency of VFA conversion to H2 decreased from 74 to 49% (Table 4). The lowering of photofermentation indexes along with upscaling was apparently due to reduction of light availability: given the incident light intensities or light paths were equal in both cases, the light distribution in culture might be different due to particular geometry of working vials or different mixing intensities. Some decrease of dry weight yield and increase in the relative BChl content (Table 4) supports this assumption indirectly. Thus, in our study the hydrogen production per 1L of culture was 1.6 and 3.2L during dark and photofermentation, correspondingly. It is somewhat higher than 1.5L in combined process reported by Chandra [12]. The total H2 production per 1L of DWW2 amounted to 1.6+16.0=17.6L. That means that 1L of DWW could produce ∼205kJ of energy. The big scale production of ethanol requires app. 38.4MJ per 1L [31] and produces 8–15L of DWW [7]. Based on these data, the recovery of energy with simultaneous DWW treatment using our method might be 1.6-3.1MJ per 1L of produced ethanol, or 4–8% of total energy consumption. Taking into account that big distillery plant produces 20,000–30,000L of ethanol daily [31], this energy recovery might be significant. Two-stage process including dark anaerobic fermentation and photofermentation was explored earlier in treatment of various wastes [15–17]. However, DWW has not been treated this way yet. Our results prove the feasibility of such a strategy. However, the obvious drawbacks should be mentioned. The first one is requirement for dilution of effluents from the 1st stage before photofermentation. It resulted, on one hand, in additional expenditure of freshwater, and on the other hand, in increasing final effluent volume. The latter causes the increase of PhBR volume and, correspondingly, its illuminated surfaces. Second, we must keep in mind that the direct coordination of two stages is not so simple because much higher rates of dark fermentation (as compared to photofermentation) should determine the much higher volume of PhBR. We showed earlier, that if we used the same sized bioreactors for both dark and light fermentations, ten PhBRs would be required to utilize the products of a single dark fermenter [16]. Some simplification of technical procedure still could be kept in mind. Our previous study demonstrated that the two-stage process operated in long-term without centrifugation or sterilization of the 1st stage effluent before feeding the PhBR [32]. Another cost-effective approach, namely the outdoor cultivation of purple bacteria in an 8L flat plate solar bioreactor, was tested by Eroglu [33]. Biohydrogen, polyhydroxybutyrate and carotenoid were produced from diluted olive mill wastewater in this study. The one-stage DWW photofermentation with mixed culture reported earlier seems to be promising, but, apparently, it still needs some improvements because purple bacteria did not survive under acidic pH conditions [12]. Recently, the effective cooperation between bacteria in starch-degrading co-culture was observed at controlled pH 7.0 [29]. In general, dark fermentation of DWW resulted in the COD decrease from 110–190 to 45–52g/L [8]. For example, during mixed culture dark fermentation the COD decreased from 101 to 43g/L in 100m3 reactor, and the VFA final concentration was∼6g/L [10]. A high COD decrease (81%) was demonstrated in a two-stage dark bioprocess including methane production [34]. The data on the purification indexes in photofermentation of DWW are quite scarce. Due to activity of Rhodopseudomonas HY21, the COD decreased from 2.6 to 0.3g/L [13], note that the initial COD was too low. In photofermentation by mixed culture, the COD decreased by 56.8% from initial 124g/L, VFA concentration decreased from 2356 to 880mg/L [12]. In our study, the major decrease of COD (from 7.46 to 2.2g/L) was observed during photofermentation of 20% DWW2f, and VFA content in the resulting effluent was about zero. So, photofermentation could be recommended as a final step for purification of preliminary treated wastes with reduced COD and high VFA content. Such an approach gives promising results for both H2 production and waste purification."
15,Conclusions,"To summarize, the sequential anaerobic scheme seems to be promising approach for both H2 production from such cheap source as DWW and purification of this hazardous waste. The dark fermentation stage provided sugar transformation into VFAs, partly utilized nitrogenous compounds, and produced H2 at 0.8–1.6L/L DWW. The photofermentation stage converted VFAs into H2 with optimal results at 20% dilution. The total H2 yield during two stages amounted to 17.6L/L DWW, which is equivalent to 205kJ/L DWW. It corresponds to recovery of 4–8% of energy consumed for ethanol production. The final effluent was free from VFAs and sugars. The first, 25-fold, working volume upscaling step resulted in ∼30% decrease of H2 yield and efficiency of VFA conversion to H2. That is why further efforts should be focused on optimization of the upscaling process."
