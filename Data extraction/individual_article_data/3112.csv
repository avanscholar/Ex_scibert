0,Introduction,"Nowadays, nanocomplexes are one of the most successful in stimulating features of nanotechnology due to its potentials and applications in almost any field [1–2]. In addition having a large surface-to-volume ratio relative to bulk materials make them so attractive and useful in comparison with conventional catalytic systems [3–4]. Several factors such as structure, morphology, shape, size, phase and arrangement of solid materials influence on the chemical and physical properties of this kind of organic-inorganic hybrid. In recent years, nanohybrids containing transition metal complexes have attracted increasing interest owing to many advantages and applications in catalysis, biological modeling, material chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and molecular magnets [5–7]. The transition metal complexes with Schiff bases as ligands are of paramount scientific interest [8–11]. These complexes play important role in the development of coordination chemistry related to catalysis and enzymatic reactions, magnetism and molecular architectures as well as for liquid-crystal technology and bioinorganic field and help to improve the quality of the life [12–15]. However, the major challenge is the discovery and development of new nanocomplex because of multistep synthesis, high cost, and potential side effect. In this regards, several physicochemical approaches for the fabrication the nanocomplex have been utilized such as solid-liquid discharge process and novel quick precipitation [16]. This kind of procedures are quite expensive and the using of toxic chemicals reducing various biological applications. Hence, bacteria, fungi, plant extracts and marine microorganisms have been performed as biological and eco-friendly systems for the green synthesis of nanohybrids [17,18]. In this regards, phytosynthesis of nanomaterials using the extraction of plants are the rapidly growing the green chemistry due to its simplicity, time saving, eco-friendliness, high rate and the possibility of obtained nanohybrids with different properties [19,20]. Ultrasound method as an agitator or homogenizer along with phytosynthesis of nanocomplex can be very interesting for industrial application [21–24]. In fact, chemical changes during ultrasonic irradiation can also be benefit many areas of chemical synthesis [25–27]. In continuing our work on the green synthesis of nanomaterials [28–36], molybdenum trioxide nanoparticles was synthesized from Sesbania sesban plant. Novel Schiff base ligand by the condensation reaction and its copper nanocomplex were obtained under ultrasonic irradiation. Nano-MoO3/Copper Schiff base complex was prepared and its catalytic activity was investigated in the green oxidation of alcohols."
1,Material and methods,"Sesbania sesban plants were collected from University of Jiroft. Vanillin and Cu(No3)2 and Ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Other chemical compounds such as 9-Aminoacridine and solvents were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Preparation of MoO3 was performed at furnace (FANAZMA GOSTAR). Thermostability of NMCS bio-nanocomposite was considered by thermo gravimetric analysis instrument (Shimadzu Japan, Model TG-50). FT-IR spectra of SL ligand, WSCS nanocomplex, and NMCS bio-nanocomposite were recorded by FT-IR spectrophotometer (NICOLET iS10). X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector (IE 300X, Oxford, UK) attached to the SEM was applied for analysis of the elemental composition of the synthesized NMCS bio-nanocomposite. To measure the size of nanoparticles, TEM microscope (Philips CM30) was used. Two-dimensional (top) and three-dimensional (down) AFM topography images of NMCS bio-nanocomposite were obtained by AFM (DME Model Igloo). An ultrasonic bath was used for synthesis of catalyst and oxidation reactions (Ultrasonic cleaner 5200i S3 model, SolTEC, Italy, frequency 40 kHz)."

3,Phytosynthesis of MoO3 nanoparticles,"3.1 Phytosynthesis of MoO3 nanoparticles The Sesbania sesban plant extract was prepared by adding 1 g of its leaves to 50 mL of Milli-Q water and heated at 80 °C for 1 h. After settling for 1 h, the extract was vacuum filtered. 100 mL of Ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (0.1 M) was added to 20 mL of the extract solution at pH = 3 within 15 min at room temperature, then the white precipitation was centrifuged and washed several times with distilled water. Finally, the as-synthesized sample was heated by the furnace at 700 °C for 3 h."
4,Synthesis of Schiff base ligand (SL),"3.2 Synthesis of Schiff base ligand (SL) Schiff base ligand was obtained by addition of a solution of Vanillin (5 mmol, 0.76 g) in ethanol (20 mL) to a solution of 9-Aminoacridine (5 mmol, 0.97 g) in 20 mL ethanol and the reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The obtained yellow precipitate was filtered and dried in air."
5,Synthesis of water-soluble copper Schiff base nanocomplex (WSCS),"3.3 Synthesis of water-soluble copper Schiff base nanocomplex (WSCS) A THF solution of of SL (2 mmol or 0.76 g in 10 mL THF) was poured drop wise under ultrasonic irradiation into THF solution of Cu(NO3)2 (2 mmol, 0.38 g in 10 mL THF). After 120 min, the obtained green precipitate was filtered, washed (ethanol and THF), and dried in the air."
6,Synthesis of nano-MoO3/copper Schiff base complex (NMCS),"3.4 Synthesis of nano-MoO3/copper Schiff base complex (NMCS) 200 μL of aqueous solution of WSCS (0.01 M) was added to 0.01 g of MoO3 nanoparticles in 10 mL of water under ultrasonic irradiation within 1 h. After that, the product was centrifuged, washed by water, and dried in the air."
7,General procedure for oxidation of alcohols,"3.5 General procedure for oxidation of alcohols To 0.1 mmol of alcohols (1.0 M) containing 0.007 g of NMCS bio-nanocomposite catalyst was added hydrogen peroxide (0.2 mmol 30%, 20 μL) under solvent free conditions, and the reaction mixture was stirred under air at 80 °C with a magnetic stirrer bar for 5 h or under US irradiation within 3 h (Table 1 ). The reaction progresses were monitored by TLC. Higher purification of products was achieved by chromatography over silica gel (n-hexane/ethyl acetate)."
8,General procedure for recycling of catalyst,"3.6 General procedure for recycling of catalyst 1 mmol of benzyl alcohol (0.1 mL) was added to 0.07 g of NMCS bio-nanocomposite catalyst and 2 mmol (40 μL) of H2O2 under solvent free conditions and ultrasonic irradiation at 80 °C within 3 h. After completion of the reaction ethyl acetate (2 mL) was added, and catalyst was filtrated and used for the next runs without any purification."
9,Results and discussion,"The ligand (SL) was obtained from condensation of Vanillin and 9-Aminoacridine and the water-soluble copper Schiff base nanocomplex (WSCS) was obtained (Scheme 1 ) by addition copper salt in tetrahydrofuran solution of SL under ultrasonic irradiation. Then, WSCS was added to MoO3 nanoparticles synthesized from Sesbania sesban plant to gain NMCS bio-nanocomposite. FT-IR spectra were recorded in solid phase using the KBr pellets technique in the range of 400–3500 cm−1. FT-IR spectra of synthesized SL, WSCS nanocomplex, and NMCS bio-nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 1 . In the free ligands (SL), the band of 3349 cm−1 was observed and assigned to ν(O–H) absorption. The strong band at 1615 cm−1 was related to streching vibrations of CN functional group, which was confirmed the presence of Schiff base. In metal nanocomplex (WSCS), azomethine band (vCN) was shifted to lower frequencies (1602 cm−1) after complexation. In fact, by the donation of electrons from nitrogen to the empty d-orbitals of the transition metal ions, this matter was happened [37]. The strong bands at 1298 and 1236 cm−1 in the free Schiff base ligands were due to the phenolic C-O stretching. On complex formation, these bands are shifted to lower frequencies (1196 and 1183 cm−1) indicating coordination through the phenolic oxygens [38]. The presence of the benzene ring conjugated to imine group in both the ligand and nanocomplex were noticed at 1589 and 1590 cm−1, respectively [39]. FT-IR spectrum of NMCS bio-nanocomposite exhibits one strong band at 579 cm−1 which can be attributed to the vibrations of metal-oxygen confirming the presence of MoO3 NPs. FT-IR of NMCS shows that amount of MoO3 are much more than WSCS nanocomplex in this NMCS bio-nanocomposite. This matter was considered by elemental analysis of this sample. The obtained results confirmed the high amount of molybdenum trioxide nanoparticles in NMCS bio-nanocomposite (Table 2 ). 6.82, 3.68, 73.00, 0.27 and 26.22% of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, copper and molybdenum was observed, respectively. The TEM and FE-SEM images of NMCS bio-nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 2 . The SEM image of this biohybrid shows the cylindrical nanocomposite with average size of 120 nm × 45 nm. The TEM image also confirms the cylindrical shaped of particles having the average crystallite size of 80 nm × 30 nm. Fig. 3 shows the EDAX spectrum of NMCS bio-nanocomposite, which can indicate the stoichiometric ratio and chemical composition of sample. The characteristic peaks relating to impurities or other precursor compounds are not observed. The thermo stability of NMCS bio-nanocomposite was also investigated. TGA was carried out between 25 and 900 °C under argon flow (Fig. 4 a). It is interesting that this bio-nanohybrid is stable up to 500 °C. However, by comparison with thermo stability of reported another copper nanocomplex (240 °C for [Cu(HL)NO3]n nanocomplex [13]), the excellent stability of NMCS bio-nanocomposite is its important feature for industrial applications. At higher temperatures, the decomposition of the compound was leaded to have MoO3 nanoparticles (observed mass 8.2%). DTA of sample also confirmed this two main weight loss stages (Fig. 4b). In continuing our characterization of NMCS bio-nanocomposite, its two-dimensional (Fig. 5 , a1 and a2) and three-dimensional (Fig. 5, b1 and b2) AFM topography images were used to determine its compositional information. Visualization of the morphology by AFM showed that NMCS bio-nanocomposite had cylindrical shape without aggregation [40]. According to AFM, the average size of this sample is 55 nm."
10,Oxidation of alcohols using H2O2 catalyzed by NMCS bio-nanocomposite,"4.1 Oxidation of alcohols using H2O2 catalyzed by NMCS bio-nanocomposite A catalytic activity of NMCS bio-nanocomposite was investigated for oxidation of alcohols (Scheme 2 ). Initially, oxidation of benzyl alcohol was selected as a model reaction, and solvent free conditions was applied as a standard green solvent. Knowing that H2O2 is unable to oxidize the benzyl alcohols in the absence of a catalyst under mild conditions, and the benzaldehyde was obtained in the presence of catalyst. According to obtained results, the reaction conversion and selectivity was affected crucially by the catalyst concentration (Fig. 6 ). With increasing catalyst amount up to 0.007 g, the yield of benzaldehyde increased significantly. Nevertheless, a further increase in this ratio diminished significantly the conversion and/or selectivity of the reaction. When the catalyst was replaced by MoO3 nanoparticles and WSCS nanocomplex, no oxidation product and 40% benzaldehyde were observed, respectively. The effect of different solvents and oxidants used on the conversion and selectivity of was studied. Dichloromethane, dichloroethane, ethanol, acetonitrile, distilled water and solvent free conditions was investigated in the process of reaction progression. 75%, 100%, 40%, 50%, 0% and 100% were the yield of benzaldehyde, respectively. The solvent free conditions were selected for further consideration. To consider the effect of amount of H2O2 on the conversion and selectivity of reaction, various H2O2/substrate molar ratios were studied in the presence of 0.007 g of NMCS bio-nanocomposite. The yield pattern changed with varying amounts of oxidant in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. With 0.2 mmol of H2O2, desired yields and selectivity of benzaldehyde was obtained (Fig. 7 ). On the other hand, 15, 30, 45, 50, 75 and 100% benzaldehyde were achieved by changing temperature from 25, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C (Fig. 9 ) (Fig. 8). To diminish the reaction time and accelerate reactions, ultrasound irradiation was used instead of magnetic stirring. In fact, ultrasound irradiation is a particularly important tool for meeting the green chemistry goals of minimization of waste and reduction of energy requirements [41]. The oxidation of benzyl alcohol under optimized conditions (0.007 g catalyst, 0.2 mmol oxidant and 80 °C) was performed under ultrasound irradiation. The use of ultrasound bath to reduce the time of reactions has proven to be a particularly important tool for meeting the green chemistry goals of minimization of waste and reduction of energy requirements [27]. It seems that the ultrasonic bath increased the rate of oxidation of alcohols and the high conversion and selectivity was achieved within 3 h. Improved contact of the catalyst as well as oxidant and substrate can be a good reason for enhancing the reaction rate in the title heterogeneous system [41]. However, ultrasonic bath could mix the reactants very well to have the good production. Seeking to expand the scope of methodology, various alcohols were selected for this heterogeneous reaction system in the presence of NMCS bio-nanocomposite using H2O2 under ultrasonic irradiations. NMCS bio-nanocomposite could oxide a wide range of primary and secondary alcohols to related aldehyde and ketone products with high conversion and excellent selectivity under optimized conditions using H2O2 at 80 °C under ultrasonic irradiations (Table 3 ). No ester or acid products were observed in this clean system (Table 3, entries 1–4). In addition, chemoselectivity of this clean system attract so much attention. The SH and hydroxyl group that are sensitive to oxidation remained completely intact under the influence of the catalyst. In fact, we have benzylic oxidation ketones product in the oxidation benzyl phenyl sulfide without formation of any sulfoxide or/and sulfone byproducts (entry 5). Primary substituted benzylic alcohols also were oxidized smoothly to their corresponding aldehydes using H2O2 (Table 3, entries 6–12). Electronic and steric demands of the substrate could effect on the conversion of reactions. In fact, aldehydes could be nearly stoichiometrically produced, and the generation of the corresponding ketones products was well controlled making this process a good alternative for this kind of production. Another advantage of this green system is that hydrophobic organic product could isolate easily by adding ethyl acetate as a safe solvent followed by evaporation at the end of the reactions. The solid catalyst in the oxidation reactions could also be washed by ethyl acetate as a green solvent and reused for the next run. The nanocatalyst could be reused at least six times without any significant loss of initial catalytic activity. After six run, the yield of benzaldehyde were 93% under ultrasonic irradiation at the desired times. It should be noted that ultrasonic irradiation diminishing the reaction times to even less than half did not change the selectivity of alcohols oxidation (Figs. 10 and 11 ). Finally, we compared the conditions of oxidation of benzyl alcohol this work and other reports. The superiority of biocatalyst is established with respect to solvent nature, temperature, oxidant, and reaction time (Table 4 ). Therefore, the use of eco-friendly oxidant, solventless of reaction, easy and safe work up procedures, cost-effective of the catalyst reusability, environmentally benign and using natural plants for catalyst preparation making title methodologies suitable for actual industrial goals."
11,Conclusion,"In conclusion, MoO3 nanoparticles were synthesized using Sesbania sesban plant. Novel Schiff base ligand by condensation reaction between Vanillin and 9-aminoacridine and its copper nanocomplex were prepared. For the first time, we synthesized MoO3/copper Schiff base complex based on Sesbania sesban plant. The catalytic activity of this bio-nanocomposite was investigated in the oxidation of alcohols under solvent free conditions and ultrasonic irradiation. Alcohols were transformed into desired aldehyde and ketone products with high conversion and excellent selectivity under optimized condition (0.007 g catalyst, 0.2 mmol H2O2 and 80 °C). This green oxidation strategy don’t need to surfactants, additives, toxic reagents, or solvents."
