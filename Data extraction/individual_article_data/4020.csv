0,Introduction,"Sanitary landfill is the widely accepted solid waste disposal mechanism everywhere in the world, because of its ability to dispose high quantities of waste at economical costs (Abu Amr and Aziz, 2012; Umar et al., 2010). When rain water infilters through the refuse in the landfill, contaminants are extracted into the liquid phase which forms highly contaminated wastewater known as leachate. Leachate migrations from the landfill or open dumping site to the surrounding soil poses environmental threat to the groundwater source and soil, if it is not properly treated (Foo and Hameed, 2009; Venu et al., 2016). Toxic matter and high COD values are the major problems in the management of leachate irrespective of the composition which directly depends upon a number of parameters like characteristics of waste dumped, depth of landfill, age of the landfill, climatic conditions, particle size, mode of operation, degree of compaction, and hydrology of site (De Morais and Zamora, 2005; Ehrig, 2015). The landfill leachate can be classified based upon the age, as young and matured, which determines the mode of treatment (Deng and Ezyske, 2011; Renou et al., 2008). Generally, high COD (>10,000 mg L−1), high BOD5/COD ratio (>0.6), and a high fraction of low molecular organics are the characteristics of leachate from young landfills (<1–2 years old) (Ehrig, 2015). Besides this large fraction of high molecular weight organics, low BOD5/COD ratio (<0.3), and moderate COD (<5000 mg L-1), are characteristics of landfill leachate from mature and old landfills (>10 years old) (Mandal et al., 2017). Removal of organic as well as nitrogenous matter from the leachate is efficiently achieved by the biological processes in the case of young leachate (Renou et al., 2008). But in the case of mature leachate, due to the low BOD5/COD ratio, the biological processes becomes less effective and physico-chemical treatment processes were adopted for the pretreatment or treatment of old leachate (Moradi and Ghanbari, 2014; Venu et al., 2014). Physico-chemical methods like coagulation and flocculation, adsorption and various membrane filtration are used for treating mature leachate (Deng and Englehardt, 2006; Renou et al., 2008). The main drawback of physicochemical process over leachate treatment is pollutant phase transfer rather than pollutant mineralization (Cortez et al., 2010). And also these conventional treatment methods (physicochemical or biological) are not enough to achieve level of purification as per the stringent effluent discharge standards followed by most of the counties. This reveals the urge for contemplating new alternative treatment methods. (Foo and Hameed, 2009; Mohajeri et al., 2010; Renou et al., 2008). The complete degradation of toxic, recalcitrant compounds and microorganisms can be achieved by the Advance Oxidation Processes (AOPs) which built its position in last decade. The mechanism of AOPs is the formation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as sulfates and hydroxyl radicals to oxidize contaminants to mineralized products: CO2, H2O and inorganic ions in short period (Chemlal et al., 2014; Primo et al., 2008). AOPs have considerable advantage over existing conventional treatment methods (Arslan-Alaton et al., 2017a; Babuponnusami and Muthukumar, 2014; Baiju et al., 2018) like (i) effective against low concentration of pollutants (ii) no chemical or biological sludge production (iii) non-selective (iv) complete mineralization can be achieved. However, energy resources like ozonizers, ultraviolet light and ultrasounds and high cost of reagent are the main drawbacks of advanced oxidation process (Azbar et al., 2004). Furthermore, toxicity of wastewater and water is increased by some intermediate oxidative products (Lin and Lin, 2016). These drawbacks could be overcome by application of the zero-valent metal such as zero valent aluminium (ZVAl) and zero valent iron (ZVI) (Bokare and Choi, 2009). The activation of oxygen to ROS by zero valent metals was extensively studied in recent years (Arslan-Alaton et al., 2017a; Bokare and Choi, 2009; Lien et al., 2002; Nidheesh et al., 2018). The ability of these metals to transfer the electrons to oxygen determines its efficiency to produce ROS and in turn the choice of zero-valent metal. The zero-valent aluminium (ZVAl) can give a more powerful force for the transfer of electron relative to ZVI due to its high dropping potential. ZVAl has attained increasing attention in current years and some studies suggest the potential of ZVAl to the decomposition of organic pollutants such as chromium (Jiang et al., 2017), bromate (Lin and Lin, 2016), dichloroacetic acid (Hrdlička, 2014), Phenol (Cheng et al., 2015), iopamidol (Arslan-Alaton et al., 2017b), acetaminophen (Zhang et al., 2012) and triton X-45 (Arslan-Alaton et al., 2017a); and treatment of textile wastewater (Khatri et al., 2018). These studies suggested that ZVAl exhibits its great potential as a promising material for the contaminant removal from the wastewater. In this study, the effectiveness of various ZVAl acid systems ie., ZVAl acid system without aeration, with aeration, with aeration and Hydrogen Peroxide (HP) addition, with aeration and persulfate (PS) addition and with aeration combined with hydrogen peroxide and persulfate (ZVAl/H+, ZVAl/H+/Air, ZVAl/H+/Air/HP, ZVAl/H+/Air/PS and ZVAl/H+/Air/HP/PS) was investigated for the elimination of organics from stabilized landfill leachate. The relevant reaction parameters such as acid washing time, contact time, initial pH, ZVAl dosage, hydrogen peroxide (HP) and persulphate (PS) dosage on COD, TOC and color removal was examined. It was also identified the contributing factors for organic pollutant reduction and to elucidate the reaction mechanisms."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Aluminium powder (analytical grade, 98% purity, 2.7 g cm−3) was purchased from LOBA chemicals. The sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8; purity > 99.5%) and analytical grade hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w) were purchased from Merck, which have been used without purification. Other chemicals which are included in this study are H2SO4, NaOH, HCl, ethanol (EtOH) and tertbutyl alcohol (TBA). All chemicals used in this study were analytical grade."
3,Leachate,"2.2 Leachate Landfill leachate was collected from Ariyamangalam municipal solid waste dumping yard, Tiruchirappalli Corporation for this study purpose. This 50 years old dumping site covers 47.7 acres with 400–600 tons of waste received per day This is located at latitude 10°48′ N and longitude 78°43′ E . The characteristics of leachate in Ariyamangalam municipal solid waste dumping yard was reported by Kanmani and Gandhimathi (2013). Based on this literature, the leachate sample was collected from drains located in old dumping area. The physico-chemical characteristics of leachate were analysed as per standard methods (APHA, 2012). Multiple samples were collected from same location to ascertain the classification of leachate. Leachate was collected in plastic cans of 5 L capacity. Nearly 15 L sample was collected for the present study which was preserved at 4 °C in refrigerator to cease biodegradation"
4,Experimental Procedure,"2.3 Experimental Procedure The batch experimental study was carried out using 200 mL stabilized leachate in 1000 mL borosil glass beaker. Leachate Sample was filtered before the commencement of each experiment. The initial pH of the leachate was brought to 2.5 by 1 N H2SO4 by dipping Procedure. A fixed amount of acid washed ZVAl which was established in advance was added to the leachate. The leachate was stirred continuously at 200 rpm over a magnetic stirrer and aeration given using fish aerator during the reaction time of 180 min. The Setup of the reactor is shown in Fig. 1 . Leachate samples were taken from the reactor at regular intervals (every 30 min), centrifuged at 6900 g-force for 3 min and 3 mL of supernatant was withdrawn for the measurement of COD. The COD of the landfill leachate sample was measured after dilution of leachate sample with distilled water. The dilution prevents the chloride interfere in the COD determination.These experiments were carried out at room temperature. The reaction was initially carried out for 180 min but the degradation reached steady state at 150 min so all the experiments were carried out for 150 min. The pH was varied by 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 7 and 8.3 to identify the influence of pH on COD removal efficiency. The ZVAl dosage was varied by 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12 g/L. Each experiment was carried out for three runs and mean was taken to avoid the error. Acid washing of ZVAl was carried out as follows: 1 g of aluminum powder was added to a conical flask which contained 30 mL of 0.1 M HCl and it allowed rotation at 200 rpm in orbital shaker for fixed period of time (1–30 min). Centrifugation collects the acid-washed ZVAl, washed with deionized water and dried at 50 °C in hot air oven."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The concentration of total organic carbon in the filtrates was analysed by TOC analyser (SHIMADZU, Japan) and the intensity of color was measured with the help of UV/Visible Spectrophotometer (Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer, USA) at a wavelength of 354 nm. The pH of the leachate was measured by Orion EA940 pH expandable ion analyser (Thermo electron corporation, USA). COD was measured using closed reflux method and sample was digested by HACH DRB 200 digester. Metals were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) (Perkin Elmer pinaacle 900 T). The TOC and COD exclusion efficiencies and color reduction were estimated using the following formulas: (1) C O D R e m o v a l E f f i c i e n c y = I n i t i a l C O D - F i n a l C O D I n i t i a l C O D X 100 (2) T O C R e m o v a l E f f i c i e n c y = I n i t i a l T O C - F i n a l T O C I n i t i a l T O C X 100 (3) C o l o r R e d u c t i o n = I n i t i a l A b s o b a n c e - F i n a l A b s o r b a n c e I n i t i a l A b s o r b a n c e X 100"
6,Characteristics of ZVAl,2.5 Characteristics of ZVAl Characteristics of ZVAl was studied before and after reaction. The X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku ultima III) was used to study the phase structure and nature of ZVAl. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was analysed based on 2θ degree diffraction between 10° and 90°. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is used for investigating the elemental composition of ZVAl before and after treatment. Binding energy (eV) peak indicates the electron state of aluminium. Surface morphology of the ZVAl was studied by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image (Vega 3 TESCAN).
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characteristics of leachate,"3.1 Characteristics of leachate The initial leachate characteristics are: pH 8.3, COD 4896 mg L−1, BOD 208 mg L−1, TOC 2747 mg L−1, Total hardness 3250 mg L−1 as CaCO3, Alkalinity 6750 mg L−1 as CaCO3, total dissolved solids 16440 mg L−1 and total suspended solids 2050 mg L−1. It was found that the BOD5/COD of leachate is 0.04 indicating the leachate is fully stabilized with low biodegradability (Abu Amr and Aziz, 2012b; Asha et al., 2017; Gandhimathi et al., 2015). Thus, AOPs are the best treatment method than biological treatment as it is stabilized."
9,COD removal by ZVAl/H+/Air system,"3.2 COD removal by ZVAl/H+/Air system 3.2.1 Effect of acid washing time and contact time As the removal of aluminium oxide layer turned out to be crucial for the effective utilization of ZVAl catalyst, the result of acid-washing time on COD elimination was first investigated. ROS was reported to be produced only after the native layer of aluminium oxide on the surface of ZVAl was removed (Cheng et al., 2015). This substantiates why an insignificant COD removal efficiency of 39.33% was observed in treatment with use of ZVAl catalyst in 180 min without acid washing. This indicates that the presence of Al2O3 layer retarded the transfer of electron within the aluminum powder (Lin and Lin, 2016). From previously published articles (Lin and Lin, 2016; Lin et al., 2017), HCl was determined to be efficient in elimination of aluminium oxide layer. Lower pKa(-6) value and lesser acid washing time of HCl makes it more appealing compared to other acids. Hence, in this study 0.1 M HCl was used for acid washing for different time ranges. The COD degradation efficiency was still insignificant when the time for acid washing was 1 min to3 min. However, a significant amount of COD removal (61.61%) was achieved once the time for acid washing was increased to 5 min. The removal became even higher to 75.48% because of the acid washing time was extended to 10 min, and the resultant COD reduced from 4896 mg L−1 to 1200 mg L−1. This shows that the acid-washing could remove layer of Al2O3, allowing ZVAl to degrade COD in leachate. With 20 min of acid washing, the degradation efficiency was additionally enhanced to 77.88%, while removal efficiency at 30 min acid-washing was almost same as at 20 min acid washing. This recommended that to maximize the degradation ability there exists an optimal acid-washing time to treat ZVAl and 20 min acid washing time was considered for further study. Fig. 2 (a) demonstrates COD exlusion efficiency with respect to various acid washing time against contact time. It clearly suggests that the COD removal increases with increase in contact time. The production of hydroxyl radical and simultaneous reduction happened at rapid rate for the first 150 min and equilibrium was reached after 150 min. Hence, in this work, 150 min was selected as the equilibrium time. A large area was available at the surface of the catalyst for the oxidation process and so higher degradation rate was observed at the beginning (Cheng et al., 2015). 3.2.2 Effect of pH Effect of pH was studied by varying the pH from 1.5 to natural pH. It was observed that at lower pH, COD removal efficiency was highest. As shown in Fig. 2(b), COD removal efficiency at 2.5 h decreased from 79% for the leachate with pH 1.5 to 65.9% for that with pH 4.5. When pH was increased to natural pH (8.3), very less COD removal (30%) was observed after 150 min of contact time. These results proved that acidic conditions are beneficial in treatment processes using AOPs and they are pH-dependent as reported (Bokare and Choi, 2009). The alkaline condition or normal pH restricted the removal of COD due to following reasons. (i) According to the Eq.(4) and Eq.(5), the condition of pH > 4.5 is not favorable for the contaminant removal as it has low concentration of H+ ions in solution at that pH. (ii) Increase in pH produces aluminium hydroxide precipitate (Al (OH) 3) during the reaction. (4) 2 A l 0 + 3 O 2 + 6 H + → 2 A l 3 + + 3 H 2 O 2 (5) A l 0 + 3 H 2 O 2 → A l 3 + + 3 H O . + 3 O H - The generation of ROS hindered by the accumulation of these precipitates on ZVAl surface and restrains the COD removal (Cheng et al., 2015). From previous studies it was found that degradation of pollutants and generation of H2O2 was higher in acidic pH of 2 (Khatri et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2012). In this study, the optimal pH was found to be 1.5 and no significant degradation was achieved at natural pH. 3.2.3 Effect of ZVAl dosage The higher aluminium loading increases the total surface area of aluminium and thereby more reactive sites are accessible at ZVAl surface to transfer the electrons to H2O2 (Liu et al., 2011). Due to this fact, the system achieves enhanced COD removal efficiency at higher aluminium loadings. As illustrated in Fig. 2(c), removal efficiency is increased with the increase in quantity of ZVAl dosage, varying from 68.27% to 83% within 150 min. As reported by Bokare and Choi (2009), the direct electron transfer from the surface of ZVAl to H2O2 in the ZVAl-acid system under constant oxygen supply produce the oxidant for the degradation of organic compounds. The optimum ZVAl dosage was 10 g/L as further increase in catalyst does not increase the removal efficiency since the removal of oxide layer and aluminium metal corrosion depletes the H+ ion (Liu et al., 2011)."
10,COD removal by ZVAl/H+ system,"3.3 COD removal by ZVAl/H+ system The role of aeration in the generation of hydroxyl radical was ensured by conducting the batch study without aeration and keeping all other conditions same as discussed above. The comparison of the treatment systems (with and without aeration) is depicted in Fig. 3 (a). ZVAl/H+/Air system with aeration achieved 83% COD removal from the leachate, whereas the system without aeration attained only 56.86% COD removal. The absence of aeration in the system made 1.45 times reduction in removal efficiency since hydroxyl radical production being slow as there is no sufficient oxygen for electron transfer. From the comparative study, it was found that the aeration plays a pivotal role in the production of hydrogen peroxide by the electron transfer and in turn hydroxyl radicals within the system. The oxygen supply for the electron transfer and for the mixing of the leachate was accomplished by the aeration."
11,COD removal by ZVAl/H+/Air/HP system,"3.4 COD removal by ZVAl/H+/Air/HP system Leachate contains numerous organic and inorganic compounds, the ZVAl/H+/Airsystem is inefficient and slow compared to most AOPs as these chemicals are anticipated to hinder pollutant degradation by competitive reactions (Yang et al., 2017). Hence, external incorporation of effective oxidants HP to the ZVAl acid system is expected to enhance COD removal rates. From Fig. 3(b), it can be witnessed that external addition of oxidant enhanced the COD removal efficiency. According to the Fig. 3(b), 0.25 mM addition of HP had no significant effect on the COD removal from leachate, whereas 0.50 mM and 1 mM addition brought 90% and 93% removal efficiency respectively with same trend of ZVAl/H+/Air system in removal efficiency as time increases. The profound effect of COD removal efficiency from 83% to 93% is mainly due to the enhanced hydroxyl radical production as shown in Eq.5. The degradation of organic contaminants from leachate increased almost 1.08 and 1.12 times with the addition of 17 mg L−1 (0.50 mM) and 34 mg L−1 (1 mM) hydrogen peroxide, respectively."
12,COD removal by ZVAl/H+ /Air/PS system,"3.5 COD removal by ZVAl/H+ /Air/PS system The time dependent change in COD removal in the system by the activation of persulfate (PS) is presented in Fig. 3(c). The exclusion rate increases as the dosage of persulfate and time increases but profound effect is observed at higher dosage after 90 min. The zero valent aluminium degrades the persulfate (Khatri et al., 2018). As a result, production of sulfate radicals occur rapidly and efficiency of removal increased from 83% to 94% with the introduction of 192 mg L−1 PS. The instantaneous formation of SO4 •− would occur with activation of PS with ZVAl as it facilitates the direct inception of Fenton-like reactions (Arslan-Alaton et al., 2018; Dogan et al., 2016) as illustrated in Eq. 6. (6) 2 A l 0 + 2 S 2 O 8 2 - + 6 H + + 1.5 O 2 → 2 A l 3 + + 2 S O 4 . - + 3 H 2 O The increased removal rate at higher dosage of persulfate is owing to the rapid production of sulfate radicals in addition to hydroxyl radicals and by hydrogen peroxide."
13,COD removal by ZVAl/H+ /Air/HP/PS system,"3.6 COD removal by ZVAl/H+ /Air/HP/PS system The zero valent aluminium acid system was activated with both hydrogen peroxide and persulfate at an amount of 1 mM to enhance the COD removal efficiency. The performance of the ZVAl based AOPs can be effectively enhanced by the external addition of oxidants and the pattern observed in the leachate treatment at pH 1.5 (optimum pH) and 3 (optimum pH for Fenton based AOPs) (Nidheesh and Gandhimathi, 2012) as depicted in the Fig. 3(d). The system with both HP and PS, at a rate of 1 mM, activated the system and achieved 90% and 96% COD removal efficiency at pH 3 and pH 1.5, respectively. The more acidic pH preferred for the ZVAl based AOPs than pH 3 is more preferable in Fenton based AOPs. COD removal efficiency of both combined system is high when compared to individual HP and PS system which showed efficiencies of 93% and 94% respectively."
14,Involvement of other metals,"3.7 Involvement of other metals Fe and Cu are metals that are present in stabilized landfill leachate which might take part in oxidization process. Experiments were performed to determine these metals involvement in the process. The elemental analysis for Fe and Cu were monitored with time for the following systems: H+/Al without AW/Air, H+/ZVAl/Air, H+/HP/Air, H+/PS/Air, with optimum operating conditions of pH 1.5, HP and PS 1 mM, catalyst 10 mg/L. Based on that, the involvement of iron and copper in the removal of COD were explored and the details are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). From the Fig. 4(a) and (b), it was found that involvement of Fe (13.905 mg L−1) and Cu (3.6 mg L−1) in the system H+/Al without AW/Air, H+/ZVAl/Air was negligible as there was no reduction observed along the process. COD removal efficiency of 35.5% and 83% was observed for H+/Al without AW/Air and H+/ZVAl/Air respectively. This results shows that Fe and Cu does not involve in generation SO4 •− and OH• radical and Al was responsible for the degradation of pollutant in Leachate. Whereas in HP and PS system consumption of these metals were witnessed as these metals are responsible for the activation of HP and PS to OH• radical and SO4 •− respectively. It was also found that usage of these metals was comparatively higher in PS system than HP. The Fe and Cu utilisation showed 23.8% of higher COD removal efficiency in HP than PS system and this is due to eq. (7) and (8). (7) Fe 2 + + H 2 O 2 → Fe 3 + + OH ° (8) C u + + H 2 O 2 → Cu 2 + + OH ° Lesser COD removal in PS system is due to insufficient metal content to activate 1 mM (238.03 mg L-1) PS as 1:1 oxidant to PS ratio is required to generate SO4•− efficiently (Asha et al., 2017), so addition of catalyst is mandatory to activate persulfate."
15,Synergistic effect,"3.8 Synergistic effect To study the Synergistic effect (SE) of ZVAl/H+ /Air/HP/PS system, 1st order kinetic rate constant for COD removal efficiency was determined. K value for ZVAl/H+ /Air/HP/PS system was 0.0243 min−1, ZVAl/H+ /Air/HP was 0.0208 min−1, ZVAl/H+ /Air/PS was 0.0218 min−1 and individual system were 0.004 min−1, 0.0017 min−1 and 0.0142 min−1 for HP, PS and ZVAl respectively. The SE determined by the following equation (9–11) (Frangos et al., 2016) (9) S E 1 = k ( Z V A l - H P - P S ) K ( Z V A l - H P ) + k ( P S ) (10) S E 2 = k ( Z V A l - H P - P S ) K ( Z V A l - P S ) + k ( H P ) (11) S E 3 = k ( Z V A l - H P - P S ) K Z V A l + k H P + k ( P S ) SE1 and SE2 compares efficiency of ZVAl/HP/PS with dual process and SE3 compares with individual process. The ratio of SE1, SE2 and SE3 are 1.08, 0.94 and 1.22 respectively. These results reveals dual processes are comparatively effective when compared to individual process for leachate degradation."
16,Aluminium release,"3.9 Aluminium release H+/ZVAl/Air system was performed with optimum operating parameters and samples were withdrawn to determine aluminium using AAS. It was found that there was aluminium release of 28.48 mg/L at 150 min reaction time. Al release along the treatment process is shown in Fig. 5 . The coagulation-flocculation process do not take place as the pH of leachate is acidic. The discharge of treated leachate as it is to the environment is dangerous as Al is toxic to the environment (Shen et al., 2018). So, in order to overcome this major drawback adjusting the pH with will precipitate the Aluminium hydroxide and treated effluent can be released to the environment (Arslan-Alaton et al., 2017b; Cheng et al., 2015)."
17,Biodegradability study,3.10 Biodegradability study The BOD5 was determined along the process. The Biodegradability increased along the process. The BOD5/COD ratio increased from 0.04 to 0.55 as shown in Fig. 6 . This increment in biodegradability and decrement in COD is due to the oxidation of pollutant by ZVAl system. This clearly explains that the further treatment of effluent by biological process can completely mineralize the pollutant.
18,ZVAl characterization,"3.11 ZVAl characterization The XRD pattern of ZVAl catalyst before and after reaction with leachate is shown in the Fig. 7 (a). The peaks of the curve at 38.520, 44.80, 65.160, 78.280 and 82.480 indicates the presence of crystalline Al as reported in various literatures (Fu et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2018) . The crystal phase of zero valent aluminum powder is stable in the whole reaction process as XRD patterns shows nearly same pattern before and after treatment (Fu et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2018). Debye-Scherrer formula was used to determine the size of the ZVAl (Eq. 12) (Nidheesh et al., 2014) (12) D = K λ β c o s θ Where D is the crystal size in nm, K is 0.9 (shape Factor), λ is 0.15405 (X-ray wavelength), β is FWHM and θ is half of diffraction angle. It was found that the particle size was 29 nm for fresh catalyst and it increased to 33 nm after use of ZVAl. Ren et al (2018) stated that the binding energy peak at 72.38 ± 0.20 in the XPS result indicates the presence of Al0. Here the XPS peak shown in the Fig. 7 (b) indicates the presence of Al0 in Fresh ZVAl and it was witnessed that the peak was reduced after reaction shows the consumption of ZVAl along the process. The percentage of Al0 in ZVAl before treatment is 20.8% and it reduced to 5.3% after treatment. The SEM image of fresh catalyst (Fig. 7(c)) has a smooth surface whereas after treatment (Fig. 7(d)) the image shows the deposition of particles. This indicates the lesser number of active sites for further reuse of ZVAl."
19,Comparison of treatment systems,"3.12 Comparison of treatment systems The color, TOC, and COD removal from the leachate which was treated in different systems (with aeration, without aeration, with HP, with PS) under optimized conditions of acid washing time of 20 min, pH 1.5, dosage of 10 g L−1 and reaction period of 150 min is demonstrated in Fig. 8 . This study postulated that the ZVAl/H+/Air/HP/PS system is more efficient than the other in the degradation of organic contaminants from leachate as it generated both OH and Sulfate radicals and it attained the effluent disposal standards. At the end of 150 min reaction period, 56.86%, 83%, 93%, 94% and 96% of COD removal was achieved by ZVAl/H+, ZVAl/H+/Air, ZVAl/H+/Air/HP, ZVAl/H+/Air/PS and ZVAl/H+/Air/HP/PS, respectively. Similarly, ZVAl/H+, ZVAl/H+/Air, ZVAl/H+/Air/HP, ZVAl/H+/Air/PS and ZVAl/H+/Air/HP/PS systems attained 30.42%, 77.18%, 78.32% ,82.07% and 83.52% total organic carbon degradation respectively. After the treatment, the dark black colour of the leachate was turned into light yellow color and the color absorbance measurement manifested that ZVAl/H+, ZVAl/H+/Air, ZVAl/H+/Air/HP, ZVAl/H+/Air/PS and ZVAl/H+/Air/HP/PS systems accomplished 31.27%, 51.27%, 61.70%, 62.64% and 63.71% respectively. As the comparative study demonstrates, the degradation rate in terms of COD, TOC and color in different treatment systems shows the following order: ZVAl/H+/Air/HP/PS > ZVAl/H+/Air/PS > ZVAl/H+/Air/HP > ZVAl/H+/Air > ZVAl/H+. The treated leachate quality after ZVAl/H+/Air system at optimized operating condition (acid washing time = 20 min, pH = 1.5, Dosage = 10 g L−1) is shown in Table 1 . The stabilized landfill leachate treatment based on various processes are shown in Table 2 . From Table 2 it is evident that ZVAl acid system is an effective system as the biodegradability of leachate is improved and shows high COD removal efficiency."
20,Scavenging experiments,"3.13 Scavenging experiments The scavenging experiment was focused on the H+/ZVAl/Air system to understand the reactive species involvement. In this system according to above said eqn. (4) and (5) the removal is due to OH radical generation. So to study the involvement of OH radical, alcohol is used as radical quenchers. The literatures thoroughly established that the ethanol (Zhao et al., 2010) and tertbutyl alcohol (Lien and Wilkin, 2002) have the ability to act as a quenching agent for hydroxyl radical. The reaction of hydroxyl radical with primary alcohol EtOH and tertiary alcohol TBA is shown in Eqs. (13) and (14). (Zhu et al., 2018) (13) O H ° + C H 3 C H 2 O H → C H C H 3 O H ° + H 2 O (14) O H ° + C H 3 3 C O H → C H 2 C H 3 2 C O H ° + H 2 O The earlier studies put forward that second order rate constant of above equations are 1.2–2.8 × 109 M−1s−1 for EtOH and 3.8–7.6 × 108 M−1s−1 for TBA (Arslan-Alaton et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018). The effect of these alcohol species in the treatment system as demonstrated in the Fig. 9 . proved the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in the degradation mechanism of leachate treatment using ZVAl-Acid system. 83% COD removal was obtained in the ZVAl/H+/Air system without any alcohol additive. But the presence of EtOH and TBA produces 50% and 66% drop in the removal efficiency, respectively. Addition of hydroxyl radical quenchers reduced COD removal efficiency of the process but not completely this is due to the presence of other organic compounds which reacts faster with hydroxyl radical than with alcohol."
21,Recyclability of ZVAl powder,"3.14 Recyclability of ZVAl powder The reusability and the easy recovery of catalyst from the treatment system in any process make the system more economical and promising technique. The ZVAl recyclability and its further treatments are depicted in Fig. 10 . The recovered ZVAl still had the capacity to degrade the contaminants from the leachate as it shows 54.24% after the 3rd cycle treatment. The degradation in the removal efficiency is due to decrease in the number of active sites and lesser surface area of the catalyst. A catalyst can be economically applied in treatment systems only if it has efficient means of recycling after its application in the treatment processes. The recovery of the aluminium from the system was easy as it involves only centrifugation, distilled water washing and oven drying at 50 °C. This acid washed zero valent aluminium can be up to three cycles for the leachate treatment as as it degrades almost 50% of pollutant at the end of third cycle."
22,Mechanism involved,"3.15 Mechanism involved The mechanism involved in the ZVAl acid system is shown in Fig. 11 . The aluminium powder was acid washed to remove the native layer of Aluminium oxide which hindered the generation of ROS. This was evident from the COD removal result before acid washing the removal was 39.33% and after acid washing it was 77.88%. ZVAl/H+/Air system under optimum operating condition exhibited 83% COD removal. The 83% COD removal is due to the generation of OH radical which was investigated by scavenging experiment i.e., indirect chemical probe method to identify the generation of OH radical. Aluminium leaching was identified which indicate the reaction has been carried out. To improve the removal efficiency, the study has been carried out with addition of external oxidants such as HP and PS under same operating conditions. 1 mM HP addition increased the COD removal to 93% with which is mainly due to the enhanced hydroxyl radical production (Eqs. (4) and (5)). Similarly, with addition of 1 mM PS the COD removal efficiency increased to 94% this is due to the formation of SO4 •− radical (Eq. (6)). The COD removal efficiency with addition of HP and PS separately is comparable as the process was performed in acidic pH of 1.5. The combined addition of HP and PS showed a removal of 96% at pH 1.5 which is due to the generation of both OH– and SO4 − radical which attacks the pollutant and mineralize to CO2 and H2O (Hilles et al., 2016, 2015)"
23,Conclusions,"The stabilized landfill leachate can be treated effectively by ZVAl based AOP. The ZVAl acid system exhibits COD, TOC and colour removal efficiencies in following order: ZVAl/H+/Air/HP/PS > ZVAl/H+/Air/PS > ZVAl/H+/Air/HP > ZVAl/H+/Air > ZVAl/H+. The highest COD, TOC and Colour removal efficiency of 96%, 83.52% and 63.71% respectively was obtained for the ZVAl/H+/Air/HP/PS system under optimum conditions of acid washing time of 20 min, ZVAl dosage of 10 g/L, pH 1.5, HP of 1 mM and PS of 1 mM. This system is superior as more ROS is generated compared to other systems. It was also found that ZVAl is recyclable up to 3 cycles making it more economical. These results reveal that the ZVAl acid system can be potentially applied for the stabilized landfill leachate treatment to degrade the pollutant completely. Residual Al will impose severe threat to environment while applying this treatment and it is recommended to remove Al before the discharge of effluent."
