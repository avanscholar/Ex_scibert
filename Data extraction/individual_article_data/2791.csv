0,Introduction,"Preserving the quality and safety of products from the time of manufacture to the time of consumption is the purpose of packaging. Over the years petroleum-derived plastics have been prevalent as packaging materials. The production and use of plastics in the world have increased enormously in the past decades (Avella et al., 2005). Most of synthetic polymers today are sourced from petrochemicals and are not biodegradable. This leads to its persistence in the environment, thereby leading to environmental pollution, harming wildlife when they are dispersed in nature (Avérous and Pollet, 2012). More than 500 billion plastic bags are distributed every year and less than 3% of the bags are recycled, while 40% of the plastics produced is discarded into land fill (Heap, 2009). Therefore, the great environmental concerns caused by non-degradable synthetic packaging has considerably favoured increased research on biodegradable materials. This is mainly due to the interest in minimizing the ecological impact caused by using synthetic packaging (Said, 2013). Biodegradable materials are materials which can be degraded by enzymatic action of living organisms, such as bacteria, yeasts and fungi. The use of biopolymers is a sustainable development approach that aids in environmental preservation and has gathered considerable attention in the last two decades. This is due to its several advantages including their non-toxicity, biodegradability, wide availability and biocompatibility, especially when compared with their synthetic counterparts (El Miri et al., 2015). It is estimated that the bioplastic material demand would reach 20% of synthetic plastic usage by 2020 (Niranjana and Prashantha, 2018). Besides their biodegradability, biopolymers have other characteristics such as air permeability, low temperature seal ability and low price compared with synthetic polymers. Biopolymers produced from various natural resources such as cellulose, chitosan, starch and various proteins from plant and animal origins have been considered as attractive alternatives to synthetic based plastic packaging materials (Sorrentino et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2012). These biopolymer-based packaging materials have beneficial properties in improving the quality of the packaged materials and extending their shelf-life (Han and Gennadios, 2005). Among the materials being utilized for production of bioplastics, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one of the most widely used. It is a non-toxic, transparent synthetic polymer with high biocompatibility and biodegradability. It is also water soluble, has good film forming properties, highly polar, and forms numerous positive interactions through hydroxyl groups (Naduparambath et al., 2018). Therefore, it shows a potential to interact and be blended with other polar polymers (Ismaiel et al., 2018). On the other hand, gelatin is also a soluble, edible and renewable material used in the production of biodegradable films. It is a protein of animal origin obtained from collagen through acid or alkaline hydrolysis, and it is widely used in both food and pharmaceutical industries (Alves et al., 2015). The use of gelatin in packaging is based on some particular properties such as cost, availability, functional attributes, flexibility, optical properties and barrier effect against gas flow (Ramos et al., 2016). Moreover, cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) is one of the most investigated bio-based fillers. They are cellulose elements with at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm (Habibi et al., 2010). The CNC is formed through the acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose fibres. They are used as reinforcements in polymer nanocomposites due to their unique properties such as high modulus, the ability to form a highly porous structure, large surface area, biodegradability and environmental benefits (Mariano et al., 2016; Ferreira et al., 2017). Cellulose nanocrystals can be isolated from various source of cellulose in nature. However, among these sources, plant biomass is the most abundant and available. Therefore, they offer the greatest potential for large scale production of CNCs. Though, it should be kept in mind that the properties of nanocellulose such as morphology, size and degree of polymerization also depend on the source from which they were isolated and not only on the isolation methods used (Habibi et al., 2010). One of the natural fibres containing cellulose is water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), which is a free-floating plant species that is found on water and considered as a weed plant in water environment. It is a natural fibre material which is not yet maximally utilized. They are considered as environmental nuisance due to their restrictions of movement on water ways, blocking irrigation channels and rivers, restricting livestock access to water, reducing infiltration of sunlight, changing temperature, pH and oxygen level of water, altering the habitats of aquatic organisms, reducing aesthetic value of water ways, and reducing water quality through decomposing plants (Burton et al., 2010). The isolation of cellulose (Mochochoko et al., 2013) and nanocellulose (Asrofi et al., 2018a, 2018b; Ewulonu et al., 2020) from water hyacinth has recently attracted researchers for its abundance cellulose (Pitaloka et al., 2013) and environmental nuisance (Asrofi et al., 2017). Although bioplastics are considered for developing eco-friendly packaging materials, they also have some limitations such as poor mechanical and barrier properties. However, these properties can be improved by blending two or more polymers with biopolymers. It is one of the most effective methods of creating new biomaterial with desired properties. Films produced through biopolymer blending usually exhibit modified properties (Sionkowska, 2011). The mechanical properties of some biopolymers have been found to increase through blending. The tensile strength and strain at break of starch was found to increase from 1.93 MPa to 4.2 MPa and from 55.62% to 64.7 3% respectively by blending with PVA (Noshirvani et al., 2018). In another study, the tensile strength of PVA was improved by blending with 25 wt% chitosan (Azahari et al., 2011). In addition, PVA as a biodegradable polymer has a very slow degradation rate and this property needs serious attention for PVA to find acceptable application for ‘on-the-go’ food wrappers. Blending PVA with biopolymers such as starch has been shown to improve its biodegradability by 60% after eight weeks burial (Choo et al., 2016). Therefore, since blending improves the properties of biodegradable polymers for packaging purposes, continuous improvement especially in properties such as water vapour permeability, biodegradation and mechanical properties is necessary. Some studies were also carried out to explore the material improvement of biofilms via crosslinking. This was achieved either through chemical or physical crosslinking (Alves et al., 2011; Rahman et al., 2011). A 46% increase in tensile strength was observed after gelatin based PVA underwent gamma irradiation (Rahman et al., 2011). However, the harmful effect of some crosslinking chemicals and methods is of serious concerns in packaging applications (Otoni et al., 2017). Therefore, bio-filler route of biofilm material improvement is under serious consideration. In the improvement of polymer properties to meet different packaging application needs, it has to be combined with other materials, often a filler to modify its properties. Besides, reinforcement with filler enhances the mechanical properties of biodegradable polymers and reduces their hydrophilic character (Chen et al., 2012). The use of bio-based and nanosized fillers have attracted considerable research interest in recent years. The mechanical properties of water hyacinth nanocellulose reinforced thermoplastic starch biocomposite showed a maximum tensile strength of 11.4 MPa and 443 MPa elastic modulus when ultrasonic vibration was employed during processing (Asrofi et al., 2018a). However, the tensile strength and tensile modulus of water hyacinth reinforced tapioca starch biopolymer were improved in another study from 1.03 MPa to 6.68 MPa and 19.66 MPa to 210.95 MPa respectively (Abral et al., 2018). In this study, cellulose nanocrystals were extracted from water hyacinth and used to reinforce PVA-gelatin films. The cellulose nanocrystals from water hyacinth fibre were prepared by acid hydrolysis using sulphuric acid. Little information of incorporating CNC to boast the properties of widely accepted film-forming blends like PVA-gelatin has been reported in literature. Therefore, this work is based on the hypothesis that value can be added to a nuisance weed (water hyacinth) for easy degradation and packaging of on-the-go foods. Expected results from this study would provide interesting application for water hyacinth and also contribute to finding solution to the pressing environmental issues on non-biodegradable and petroleum-based plastics films in food packaging applications especially for on-the-go foods."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Analytical grades of polyvinyl alcohol (molecular weight, 115 000 g/mol; degree of polymerization, 1700–1800), gelatin (bloom strength 185), glycerol (98%), sulphuric acid (99%), sodium hydroxide, sodium chlorite, acetic acid (98%), benzene (99%), ethanol (99%), calcium chloride (96%) and potassium sulphate (99%) were used as purchased from Onitsha Bridge-head Chemical Market, Anambra State, Nigeria. The water hyacinth plant was harvested from Onopa Town Stream in Epie Atisa III, Yenagoa L.G.A, Bayelsa State, Nigeria."
3,Cellulose pulp extraction,"2.2 Cellulose pulp extraction Cellulose was extracted from the water hyacinth stem fibre (WHF) using similar method by Zhou et al. (2017) with slight modification. The fibre was harvested, washed properly and dried. The fibre was cut to about 10 mm length, further ground into powder, and sieved to 150 µm before boiling it in a sodium hydroxide solution. This treatment was carried out for 1 h using 17.5% (w/V) sodium hydroxide at 80 °C. The resultant fibres were then washed thoroughly with distilled water and oven-dried at 100 °C to constant weight. The 1 g of the dried fibre was bleached with 0.6 g sodium chlorite, 0.5 mL acetic acid and 65 mL distilled water for 1 h at 75 °C in line with previous reported bleaching technique (Zhou et al., 2017). Additional bleaching solution was continuously added at 1 h interval and after 3 h the fibres turned white. The fibres were then washed thoroughly with distilled water and air dried to a constant weight. The water hyacinth fibres were characterized to determine its cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content. Concisely, the WHF were made extractives-free using ethanol-benzene according to Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) T204 cm-97 (Technical Association of Pulp and Paper Industry, 2007. Solvent extractives of wood and pulp. Available at: www.tappi.org.) after which the Wise chlorite method was used to delignify the fibres to obtain the holocelluloses (Wise et al., 1946). The holocellulose was used to determine the cellulose content according to the TAPPI T 203 cm-99 (Technical Association of Pulp and Paper Industry, 2007. Alpha, -beta, -gamma cellulose in pulp. Available at: www.tappi.org.) and the hemicellulose was gotten from the difference between the holocellulose and the cellulose. Finally, the lignin content was obtained according to TAPPI T 222-om 2 (Technical Association of Pulp and Paper Industry, 2006. Acid -insoluble lignin in wood and pulp. Available at: www.tappi.org.)."
4,Preparation of water hyacinth cellulose nanocrystals (CNC),"2.3 Preparation of water hyacinth cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) The CNC was obtained by controlled acid hydrolysis using 8.75 mL of 64 wt% sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and 1 g dried cellulose pulp. The mixture was vigorously stirred at 45 °C for 30 min in accordance to previous reports (Csiszár and Nagy, 2017; Kargarzadeh et al., 2017). At the expiration of the time, 10 folds of cold deionised water was used to quench the reaction. The cold suspension was centrifuged at 8500 r/min for 10 min and the supernatant liquid decanted. The solid content was continuously diluted and centrifuged until it became turbid. The turbid suspension was then dialysed (SpectraPor 4 dialysis membrane, 12–14 ku) against deionised water for a week till pH of about 6.8 was achieved. The collected suspension was stored in a refrigerator until use and the weight percent of CNC content in the suspension was determined using gravimetric method."
5,Nanocomposite film preparation,2.4 Nanocomposite film preparation The films were prepared by solution casting method similar to the method of Alves et al. (2011). A predetermined weight of PVA (as per the design of experiment) was dissolved in distilled water at 90 °C for 30 min with constant stirring until complete dissolution was obtained to make 100 g solution. A known weight (as per the design) of gelatin was also dissolved in separate distilled water at 60 °C. The PVA and gelatin were then mixed together with continuous stirring for 30 min at 90 °C. Required quantity of CNC was dispersed in glycerol (30 wt% of the total solid content of gelatin and PVA) at ambient temperature and added in drops to the PVA/Gelatin solution while stirring at 90 °C. The mixture was poured into a petri dish of 130 mm diameter after 30 min of stirring and air dried for 48 h to ensure slow evaporation of the solvent. Resultant films were peeled off the dish and stored in a desiccator until their evaluation. The possible reaction route for the formation of the biodegradable nanocomposite films is displayed in Fig. 1 .
6,Experimental design,"2.5 Experimental design Central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology was used to study effects of the concentrations of poly (vinyl alcohol), gelatin and cellulose nanocrystals as independent variables on the dependent variables (tensile strength and elongation). The factors and levels of the experimental design are displayed in Table 1 . The table also showed the unit of each factor where PVA and gelatin concentrations were obtained with respect to 100 g of the film forming solution, and the CNC reinforcement obtained with respect to the total solid content of the film forming solution (PVA and gelatin). Quantitative composition of the formulation was designed based on the expected contribution of each item on the general performance of the fabricated nanocomposite films in accordance with previous works (Salisu, 2012; Alves et al., 2015; Kargarzadeh et al., 2017). The 20 experimental runs were obtained using the CCD with alpha (α) value of 1.68. These formulations consist of six centre points, six axial points and eight factorial points. The experiments were conducted randomly and the data were analyzed by using Design Expert Software version 10."
7,X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of water hyacinth CNC,"2.6 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of water hyacinth CNC The cellulose nanocrystals were examined using Siemens D-500 diffractometer at 40 kV X-ray radiation. Scattered radiation was detected in the angular range (2θ) between 5° and 90° and was plotted as curve used to determine the crystallinity percentage of the CNC in accordance to method described in literature (Segal et al., 1959). (1) Crystallinity ( % ) = I 002 − I am I oo 2 × 100 % where I 002 is the peak intensity of the crystallographic plane and I am is the intensity scattered by the amorphous part of the sample, mostly around 2θ = 18°."
8,Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of water hyacinth CNC,2.7 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of water hyacinth CNC A drop of diluted CNC suspension deposited on a copper grid was allowed to dry and investigated using JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. The morphological image obtained was analysed for particle size of the cellulose nanocrystal sample using Image J 1.52 visualization software by measuring and averaging the size of over 100 CNC nanoparticles.
9,Morphological and chemical structural analysis of nanocomposite films,"2.8 Morphological and chemical structural analysis of nanocomposite films The dispersion of the CNC fillers within the polymer matrix was examined by scanning electron microscope on a VEGA 3 TESCAN at 5 kV. The film samples were dried overnight under vacuum at 40 °C and then prepared by cryogenically fracturing to expose their cross section for examination. To improve contrast in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), the samples were coated with 5-nm layer of platinum prior to analysis. The chemical structure of the films was studied using an Equinox 55 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer equipped with a golden gate single attenuated total reflection (ATR) cell. The FT-IR spectra was taken in the transmittance mode between the range of 4000–500 cm–1 with a 4 cm–1 resolution."
10,Thermogravimetric analysis,2.9 Thermogravimetric analysis The thermal degradation process of the cellulose nanocrystals and nanocomposite films were evaluated using SDT Q600 thermogravimetric analyser. The samples were heated from 0 °C to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere using approximately 3.8 mg of the samples.
11,Dynamic mechanical analysis,"2.10 Dynamic mechanical analysis The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was further studied using NETZSCH DMA 242 to determine the storage modulus, the tan δ peak, and the glass transition temperature (T g) of the nanocomposite films. Measurements were carried out from 30 °C to 200 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min with a fixed frequency of 2 Hz. The film cantilever mode used rectangular samples with dimensions of 80 mm × 20 mm."
12,Nanocomposite film behaviour to water,"2.11 Nanocomposite film behaviour to water The films properties in the presence of water were evaluated through their degree of water absorption, water vapour permeability (WVP) and total soluble matter. Films for water absorption were cut to 30 mm × 20 mm, weighed before being submerged in 100 mL of water and removed after 5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110 and 130 min for reweighing. The amount of water absorbed by each selected film at specific time interval was calculated from Eq. (2). The test was also repeated using a saline water (3.5 g of NaCl salt per 100 g distilled water) to determine the possible effect of sea water on the degradation rate of the nanocomposite films. The WVP determination was done by gravimetric method according to ASTM E96/E96M-05 (2005). Briefly, 4 g of anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2) was poured inside a glass bottle of known diameter and depth to maintain a relative humidity (RH) of 0. The glass bottle was covered with the nanocomposite film, weighed and inserted in a desiccator containing potassium sulphate (K2SO4) at relative humidity of 98% and temperature of 25 °C. The sample was weighed every 24 h to determine the weight change of the glass bottle as a function of time. Slopes were obtained by linear regression (weight change versus time). The water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) was determined as the slope of the straight line (g/h) divided by the area of the glass bottle mouth (m2). Finally, the WVP (g/(m•h•Pa)) was calculated as shown in Eq. (3). (2) Water absorption ( % ) = W b − W a W a × 100 % where W a is initial constant weight of film; and W b is final constant weight of the film. (3) WVP = WVTR S ( R 1 − R 2 ) X where X is the thickness of the film (m), S is the saturated water vapour pressure (Pa) at the test temperature (25 °C), R 1 and R 2 are the relative humidity in the climatic chamber and in the glass bottle, respectively. The film solubility in water was determined by drying the nanocomposite film (30 mm × 20 mm) in a desiccator containing calcium chloride until a constant weight was achieved. Afterward, the sample was immersed in 100 mL of water at room temperature for 24 h. The sample was removed from the water, patted dry with a lint free cloth and placed back in the desiccator to reach constant dry weight. The same procedure was repeated to obtain the percentage soluble matter (Eq. (4)) of the sample in saline water. (4) Soluble matter ( % ) = W a − W b W a × 100 % The moisture uptake was measured according to the method of Anglès and Dufresne (2001) as reported by Noshirvani et al. (2018). Dried films of 20 mm × 20 mm were first conditioned at 0% relative humidity using calcium sulphate for 24 h. After weighing the films were conditioned in a desiccator containing potassium sulphate saturated solution at 25 °C to ensure a 98% relative humidity. The films were later weighed at desired intervals until the equilibrium state was reached. The moisture uptake was then calculated according to Eq. (5). (5) Moisture uptake ( % ) = W t − W a W a × 100 % where Wt is the weight after t time at 98% relative humidity of the sample."
13,Tensile examination,"2.12 Tensile examination Tensile testing (Eq. (6)) was carried out with M500-25CT Universal mechanical testing machine according to ASTM Standard D882-09 (2009). The samples were kept in a desiccator containing calcium chloride desiccant for 24 h prior to testing. Films of 100 mm × 20 mm rectangular strips were used while thickness of the samples were measured by averaging 10 random points on the sample using a handheld micrometre with a precision of 0.01 mm. The thickness of the films was 0.21±0.03 mm. Tensile strength measurements were performed with 60 mm grip separation, pretension of 5 N and crosshead speed of 50 mm/min. The data for elongation at break were also calculated using Eq. (7) from the same procedure. (6) Tensile strength = Load ( N ) Thickness ( mm ) × Width ( mm ) (7) Elongation at break ( % ) = Displacement at break Guage length × 100 %"
14,Soil degradation of nanocomposite films,"2.13 Soil degradation of nanocomposite films The soil degradation test was conducted as reported by Salisu et al. (2012) with slight modification. The films to be tested were weighed and buried at 6 cm depth in a bin containing sand. The samples were carefully taken out from the soil in 4 days interval for 28 days, dried and weighed again to determine the weight loss."
15,Results and discussion,
16,Characterization of water hyacinth,"3.1 Characterization of water hyacinth The chemical composition of the water hyacinth showed a cellulose content of 45.52% with a low lignin content of 8.31%. The hemicellulose and extractive contents were found to be 21.76% and 5.84%, respectively. The cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content of water hyacinth in previous studies ranged from 25% to 49%, from 18% to 22% and from 3% to 26%, respectively (Nigam, 2002; Mukherjee and Nandi, 2004). This variation may be due to the different growing environment of water hyacinth. Besides, CNC obtained from the water hyacinth had a consistency suspension concentration of 4.16 wt% while yielding 33.69% CNC from the water hyacinth cellulose pulp. This is higher than that obtained from rice straw, 13%–18% (Lu and Hsieh, 2012) and lower than that obtained from sugarcane bagasse (45%) and cotton (42%) (Sorrentino et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2012)."
17,Crystallographic analysis,"3.2 Crystallographic analysis The crystallinity of the CNC from water hyacinth fibre was determined using the X-ray diffraction (XRD). The degree of crystallinity of natural fibres is improved by removing the non-crystalline constituents from the fibres through acid hydrolysis. Therefore, from the bleached water hyacinth fibre, only the amorphous cellulose was removed. The hydronium ions penetrate in these amorphous zones, promoting the hydrolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bonds releasing individual crystallites, whereas the crystalline zones are more resistant to the chemical attack (Agustin et al., 2014). Cellulose crystallinity is one of the key factors that determine its diffraction patterns. The diffractogram of cellulose nanocrystals from water hyacinth fibre is presented in Fig. 2 . The XRD pattern of the cellulose nanocrystals showed that the major intensity peak is located at the 2θ value of around 22.4°, which is related to the crystalline structure of cellulose 1 (El Miri et al., 2015). Additionally, it has been reported that the peaks observed at the 14.4° and 34.4° are also characteristics of cellulose 1 (Flauzino Neto et al., 2013). Crystallinity index of the CNC from water hyacinth was calculated to be 72% according to the Segal equation (Equation (1)). This is higher than that obtained by Agustin et al. (2013) from garlic stalk (62%) and that obtained by El Miri et al. (2015) from sugar cane bagasse (65%) but lower than that reported by Chen et al. (2012) from potato peel (85%). However, reported values for crystallinity ranged from 54% to 88% depending on the source of cellulose (Brinchi et al., 2013). The difference in crystallinity index could also be as a result of the hydrolysis conditions used in extracting the CNC (Flauzino Neto et al., 2013)."
18,Morphological analysis,"3.3 Morphological analysis The TEM micrograph of CNC extracted from bleached water hyacinth fiber is presented in Fig. 3 a to illustrate size and physical structure of the nanocrystals. The TEM image evidently shows that cellulose nanocrystals were extracted from the WHF by the presence of spherical-like nanosized cellulose particles. The strong aggregation ability of the CNC resulted in the parallel deposition of the spherical-like shaped particles. Additionally, it is also obvious that the CNC seen in Fig. 3a overlaps each other, a situation that leads to the creation of large aggregation in the aqueous suspensions (Csiszár and Nagy, 2017). It has also been reported that the aggregated particles could occur during the drying step while preparing specimen for TEM test (Ewulonu et al., 2019) or due to the strong hydrogen bonding of the nanoparticles (Habibi et al., 2010). Kumar et al. (2020) suggested that the compact aggregate of CNCs shows that CNC chains have intermolecular hydrogen bonding and a strong hydrophilic interaction in between the chains. The isolated CNCs were found to have diameters ranging from 20 nm to 50 nm with an average diameter of 31 nm. Though this is similar to the range obtained by Agustin et al. (2013) from garlic stalks (30–50 nm). Zhou et al. (2017) also reported values between 10 nm and 50 nm for CNC obtained from cotton stalk and Benini et al. (2018) recorded 10–60 nm for CNC from Imperata Brasiliensis grass. However, Kargarzadeh et al. (2017) reported lower diameter of 15–20 nm from rice husk fibre. There are wide ranges of values published for CNCs derived from various or similar resources (Dufresne, 2012). Since different extraction methods and analytic techniques are employed, comparison of data is difficult. Moreover, the visibly pronounced dark spot on the TEM micrograph could be as a result of impurities introduced during the course of preparation or testing or most likely derived from the non-cellulosic accompanying the water hyacinth fiber. On the other hand, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image showing the dispersion of CNC within the PVA-gelatin matrix is also presented in Fig. 3. The unreinforced film (Fig. 3b) showed some unbound granules in the micrograph with some discontinuous cracks which may have resulted from inadequate homogeneity during film preparation (Ma et al., 2017). Better interaction and cohesive structure between CNC and matrix were observed for the film reinforced with 5 wt% CNC (Fig. 3c). While the 10 wt% CNC (Fig. 3d) reinforced PVA-gelatin film exhibited some inhomogeneity and deep crack surface. This could be as a result of higher CNC reinforcement leading to a decrease in its dispersibility and more agglomeration."
19,Chemical structure of CNC and nanocomposite films,"3.4 Chemical structure of CNC and nanocomposite films The FT-IR analysis presented in Fig. 4 was carried out to determine the chemical structure of the nanocomposite films and the CNC. The broad peak around 3280 cm–1 in the nanocomposite films signifies the huge presence of hydroxyl groups corresponding to the polyvinyl alcohol. Linear C–H stretching of PVA and gelatin was identified at the 2933 cm–1 peak while peak around 1645 cm–1 may be primarily due to the stretching vibration of the C=O bond (amide I). The peak at 1543 cm–1 is due to the coupling of the –NH bond and the stretching of the C–N bond of the amide II group (Dey et al., 2014). The 1237 cm–1 is due to the –CH2 wagging or as a result of stretching of N–H and C–N of the amide III, 1032 cm–1 is ascribed to C–O stretching of the secondary alcoholic groups or as a result of CH2 bending vibration (Saurabh et al., 2016). The peaks at 920 cm–1 and 849 cm–1 may be due to the CH2 rocking and C–C stretching respectively. Furthermore, FT-IR spectra of the CNC also showed presence of OH group and stretching of –CH group at 3332 cm–1 and 2899 cm–1, respectively. The peak at 1427 cm–1 can be due to –CH deformation of cellulose (Rosa et al., 2010) while presence of peak at 1733 cm–1 though not very intense may correspond to C=O stretching of the acetyl group and uronic ester group of hemicelluloses. Absence of peaks around 1500 cm–1 (C=C aromatic skeletal vibration of lignin), 1400 cm–1 (C–H and O–H bending of lignin) and 1260 cm–1 (C–O stretching of lignin) indicates the complete removal of lignin from the CNC. The peak at 1051 cm–1 may be due to the CO bond stretching of the –C–O– group in the anhydroglucose ring while 849 cm–1 peaks may be assigned to the half-ester sulphate group produced by sulphuric acid during hydrolysis (Agustin et al., 2013)."
20,Tensile strength,"3.5 Tensile strength The tensile strength (TS) of PVA-gelatin reinforced with various contents of water hyacinth CNC was investigated and presented in Table 2 . Favourable interfacial interaction between the CNC and polymer matrix, along with homogeneous dispersion and distribution of the CNC are key points needed for enhanced tensile properties (Habibi et al., 2010). Comparatively observing Run 7 (unreinforced film), Run 1 (5 wt% CNC reinforced film) and Run 3 (10 wt% CNC reinforced film) shows that CNC improved the tensile strength of the films. However, a slight decrease was noticed when the CNC was increased from 5 wt% to 10 wt% which may have resulted from poor dispersion. Poor dispersion is mostly caused by aggregated particles which further creates stress points in the matrix thereby lowering the positive contribution of CNC to the tensile strength (Agustin et al., 2013). Furthermore, the contributions of PVA to the tensile strength of the nanocomposite were observed to be more than those of gelatin when the following runs; 20 and 16, 13 and 9, and 5 and 15 were closely evaluated. Similar observation was also made by Bahy et al. (2012) in their study on the preparation and characterization of polyvinyl alcohol/gelatin blends. Generally, the least strength was observed in Run 2, followed by Runs 7 and 14 having values of 7.35 MPa, 7.91 MPa and 8.47 MPa respectively. While Run 20 had the highest tensile strength of 13.83 MPa, followed by 11.75 MPa and 11.61 MPa of Runs 10 and 5 respectively. Low density polyethylene that is predominately used in film packaging applications has a tensile strength within 8–31 MPa (Mangaraj et al., 2009). Alves et al. (2015) reported the TS ranging from 10.91 MPa to 49.09 MPa for CNC/gelatin in corn starch plasticised films. The resultant effects of PVA, gelatin and CNC concentrations on tensile strength of the nanocomposite were further construed in the statistical analysis. Though improved tensile strength is a desirable property, the films application and end-life property need to also be considered when improving strength. The range of tensile strength obtained in this study falls within the range that can be considered for food wrapping application and also similar to the values obtained in other studies (Gonzalez et al., 2015; Kanatt et al., 2017; Kargarzadeh et al., 2017; Noshirvani et al., 2018). It is also important to note that strength of packaging materials needs to be weighed against its suitability for ‘on-the-go’ packaging which usually requires very limited lifespan to avoid environmental pollution."
21,Elongation at break,"3.6 Elongation at break Elongation is an important mechanical property for the application of polymers in packaging. This property is calculated as the percentage increase in length the film will be achieved before failure. Elongation at break (EB) of the water hyacinth CNC reinforced PVA/Gelatin film was investigated and presented in Table 2. Evidently, CNC decreased the elongation at the break of the films. For example, considering unreinforced film of Run 7 against Run 1 and Run 3 having 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforcements respectively shows that EB decreased from 70.3% to 55.4%. The reduction in EB is also reported (Fernandes et al., 2010) in chitosan films incorporated with nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC). The NFC made the films to be brittle at high load contents of 40%–60%. This behaviour of CNC nanofillers could have resulted from the stiffness introduced by the creation of three-dimensional network structure in the nanocomposite films (Noshirvani et al., 2018). Further observations from comparing Run 5 and 15, Run 20 and 16 show that PVA contributed more to the film's EB increase than gelatin. Similar observation has also been made by Dey et al. (2014) while investigating the influence of gelatin on PVA/Gelatin blends. Moreover, 81.2% is the maximum EB value obtained in this study with the least value of 45.56% corresponding to Runs 20 and 2, respectively. Though the packaging application favours higher values of EB, this must also be proportional to the films ability to withstand tensile stress required in carrying the packing load. The contributions of each component were further evaluated through statistical analysis to obtain the optimum performance of the nanocomposite films."
22,Statistical analysis,"3.7 Statistical analysis Multiple regression analysis was applied on the experimental data and quadratic model was selected as the appropriate model for analysing both the TS and EB as presented in Table S1. The variance of the independent variables was analysed using quadratic model with respect to the response variables in order to examine the data's goodness of fit. Besides, the quadratic model is the model that maximized the statistically adjusted R 2, predicted R 2 and R 2 values. Subsequently, a final model equation was obtained as shown in equations (8) (TS) and (9) (EB) for predicting the responses for a given level of each factor. Nonetheless, the positive coefficients show the positive effects of the factors on the responses while the negative signs indicate opposing effects on the responses. Consequently, it was observed that the coefficients associated with A (PVA), B (gelatin), C (CNC), AC (interaction between PVA and CNC), BC (interaction between gelatin and CNC) and A 2 are positive for the tensile strength response. However, PVA and gelatin only made positive contributions to the EB, while the interaction between them and CNC affected the EB negatively. Obviously, the highest regression coefficients are related to PVA and CNC for the tensile strength while the coefficients associated with PVA and gelatin are for EB. Therefore, it can be said that PVA and CNC had the greatest effect on tensile strength, whereas PVA and gelatin had the greatest effect for the EB. This is true because the CNC has the capacity to impart network structure in the matrix which strengthens the nanocomposite thereby increasing the TS. However, the networked structure inhibits molecular mobility which decreases the elongation of the matrix under stress. (8) T S ( MPa ) = 10.74 + 0.90 A + 0.30 B + 0.33 C − 0.66 A B + 0.60 A C + 0.29 B C + 0.58 A 2 − 0.70 B 2 − 0.64 C 2 (9) E B ( % ) = 61.56 + 6.86 A + 5.37 B − 3.57 C − 5.34 A B + 2.36 A 2 + 1.55 B 2 where A, B, C are the various coded values of the independent variables. Meanwhile, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the fitted quadratic model and the corresponding significant model terms for the responses are presented in Table 3 . The model F-value of 35.19 for TS and 50.94 for EB implies that the model is significant. Moreover, there is only a 0.01% chance that an F-value this large could occur due to noise. Additionally, P-values lower than 0.05 corresponds to significant model terms. Therefore, all model terms are significant for the tensile strength while A, B, C, AB, A 2 and B 2 are the only significant terms for the elongation at break. Furthermore, the lack of fit F-value of 2.55 and P-value of 0.16 implies that there is an insignificant lack of fit relative to pure error for the tensile strength. The elongation at break also presented an insignificant lack of fit, with an F-value of 2.3 and P-value of 0.19. This indicates that there is 16.38% and 19.12% chance that lack of fit this large could occur due to noise for the tensile strength and elongation at break respectively. This shows that the model is appropriate for the experiment. Accordingly, the R 2 is close to unity with a value of 0.9694 for TS and 0.9787 for EB. The predicted R 2 is also in reasonable agreement with the adjusted R 2, having differences lower than 0.2. In addition, the adequacy precision used to measure the signal to noise ratio is 25.267 for tensile strength and 26.31 for elongation at break and these values are higher than the least desired ratio of 4. Undoubtedly, the model can be used to navigate the experimental design space."
23,Response surface,"3.8 Response surface The statistically significant factors derived from the statistical analysis were used to construct the 3D plots displayed in Fig. 5 . The figure presented combined effects of the independent variables (PVA, gelatin and CNC) on the tensile strength and elongation at break. The responses were studied as a function of two factors while the third factor was kept constant. Fig. 5a shows that higher quantities of PVA and gelatin produced a corresponding incremental improvement on tensile strength reaching a moderate point of about 10 MPa. However, an optimal was observed with incremental quantities of PVA reaching its maximum while gelatin quantity could not achieve optimum at its maximum input. This is further collaborated in Fig. 5c where PVA was kept constant at its maximum input and CNC interaction with gelatin studied. Obviously, PVA and CNC are the major contributors to the tensile strength possibly because of their molecular structural configuration while gelatin simply acted as a plasticizer improving the film forming capacity of the nanocomposite. Plasticizers have been reported to decrease TS by interfering with the polymer molecular chain through the reduction of intermolecular forces which then soften the rigidity of the film structure and increase the polymer mobility (Qi et al., 2004; Ahmed and Ikram, 2016). This is true since Fig. 5b showed the nanocomposites reached an optimal TS of about 13 MPa when evaluating the contributions of PVA and CNC while leaving gelatin constant. This optimal was proportional to the gradual increment of the PVA and CNC input. Further evaluating the interaction between PVA and gelatin shows that the absence of CNC prevented the films from reaching optimal TS level (Fig. S1a) while optimal TS was achieved in Fig. S1b by incorporating the least amount of CNC. The behaviour of PVA in PVA/gelatin blend has been collaborated by Bahy et al. (2012) while Kumar et al. (2015) and Islam et al. (2014) showed that PVA and CNC combine to increase the TS of nanocomposites. Additionally, It was observed that increasing gelatin and CNC while leaving PVA constant led to an increase in strength before continous decrease was observed when above 7.5 g per 100 g of gelatin was used (Fig. S1c). Contrarily, high quantity of PVA makes films brittle and PVA above 5 wt% may pose a challenge to degradation (Kawai and Hu, 2009) and toxicity to fish in water (Kerfoot, 2012). Therfore, this work has shown that an optimal TS can be obtained with the incorporation of more CNC and perserving the degradability of the nanocomposite films. Though PVA contributes to the high TS of the films, its effect is mostly felt at high value as can be seen in Figs. S1e, S1f and 1c. Meanwhile, statistically significant factors from the ANOVA of elongation at break was PVA and gelatin, and were used to construct 3D plots of Figs. 5d, 5e and 5f. Fig. 5d showed that in the absence of CNC, PVA and gelatin achieved optimal EB with continuous incremental quantity in the nanocomposite. This is in agreement with the works of Bahy et al. (2012) while biodegradable films fabricated from starch/PVA composite exhibited TS and high EB of 16.22 MPa and 116.12%, respectively. However, with the gradual introduction of CNC in Fig. 5e (5%) and Fig. 5f (10%), the optimal EB disappeared to the side lines where individual contributions could only be felt. This further confirms the assertion that gelatin mainly contributed to the plasticization and film formability of the nanocomposite. It is also important to note that CNC networks the structure of the nanocomposite which is the reason for improving TS and reducing EB. In the case of EB, networked structures hinder molecular mobility which is the major attribute for increased elongation at break. Moreover, chitosan-gelatin biodegradable film prepared for food packaging showed higher TS of 28.87 MPa and lower EB of 17.99% respectively (Kumar et al., 2018). Similarly, TS of chitosan/gelatin biodegradable packaging film was also reported to be 20 MPa (Ahmed and Ikram, 2016). However, PVA-gelatin food packaging films containing tomato pulp showed TS of 6.86 MPa and elongation of 75.38% (Kanatt et al., 2017), while in another study, CNC reinforced starch films for food packaging showed an optimum TS of 4 MPa when 6% CNC was used for reinforcement (Kargarzadeh et al., 2017). Therefore, the nanocomposite films fabricated in this study falling within the range of 7–14 MPa for TS and EB of 45%–81% could be used for packaging application. It can be readily considered for packaging ready-to-eat food items where moderate EB is satisfactory."
24,Verification of experiment,"3.9 Verification of experiment The experimental design was used to optimize the concentration of the PVA, gelatin and CNC for the purpose of achieving the optimum value for tensile strength and elongation at break. The optimum values were obtained at PVA of 10 wt%, gelatin of 5 wt% and 7 wt% CNC for a corresponding predicted value of 13.57 MPa and 87.94% for tensile strength and elongation at break respectively at a desirability level of 99%. To test the models, the confirmation experiments were performed and their values compared to the predicted values. From the comparison, a good agreement was observed as the percentage error between predicted and experimental values was below 10% (Table 4 ). Therefore, the design models obtained in this study are important for the fabrication of CNC reinforced PVA-gelatin films for on-the-go food wrappings."
25,Thermal analysis,"3.10 Thermal analysis Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) were carried out in order to investigate the thermal properties of the CNC and nanocomposites. The results presented in Fig. 6 a shows that the nanocomposites were thermally stable in the region below 250 °C. Thus, both CNC and the nanocomposites were able to maintain more than 90% of their original weight at this temperature. Meanwhile, it is believed that the main degradation for CNC which occurred between 250 °C and 378 °C was due to the depolymerisation, dehydration and decomposition of glycosyl units. Zhou et al. (2017) reported an onset degradation temperature of 245 °C which is close to that obtained in this study. The CNC sample gradually lost weight in the early stage of the heating process due to free water present in the sample (Xu et al., 2017). The CNC reached its peak degradation temperature at 359 °C as seen in the DTG curve. Peak degradation temperature as high as 364 °C for CNC has been reported (Benini et al., 2018). This peak degradation temperature coincides with the widely accepted primary thermal decomposition of cellulosic materials which lies between 200 °C and 400 °C (Agustin et al., 2014). Beyond 400 °C, the loss in weight was relatively gradual and gave about 32% char residue. The sulphate groups from sulphuric acid hydrolysis may have contributed to the quantity of residue after the decomposition. The unreinforced and reinforced PVA-gelatin nanocomposite films exhibited similar curve pattern, though addition of CNC improved their thermal stability. The initial degradation temperature of unreinforced film was 204 °C while the 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced films were 207 °C and 209 °C, respectively. From the DTG graph, all decomposition peaks of the nanocomposite moved to a slightly higher temperature after the addition of CNC. The degradation temperature of the nanocomposite films slightly moved up from 380 °C for unreinforced film to 383 °C and 385 °C on addition of 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC, respectively. Indicating that CNCs slightly improved the thermal stability of the nanocomposite by acting as an insulator and mass transport barrier to the volatile products generated during decomposition (Benini et al., 2018)."
26,Dynamic mechanical analysis,"3.11 Dynamic mechanical analysis The storage modulus (E ’) and evaluation of the loss factor (tan δ) as a function of temperature for the unreinforced PVA-gelatin film, the 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced blends are shown in the Fig. 6b. In general, the storage modulus of the nanocomposites was observed to significantly decrease with increasing temperature, showing the main relaxation transition. In addition, the unreinforced film exhibited a steep decrease with increasing temperature while the reinforced films had less steep decrease when temperature was increased. This is likely due to the filler and polymer interaction, and also possibly a CNC percolation network within the films (Luo et al., 2017). Anyway, at 25 °C the 10 wt% CNC reinforced film has the least storage modulus of 2.25 GPa while the 5 wt% CNC reinforced film exhibited the highest storage modulus having a value of 3 GPa which is higher than those of the unreinforced film (2.5 GPa). An increase from 1.35 GPa to 1.5 GPa was reported for rice husk CNC reinforced starch films (Kargarzadeh et al., 2017). The tan δ curve exhibits relaxation peak corresponding to the glass transition temperature (T g) of the films. It was observed that the addition of CNC significantly shifted the T g of the nanocomposite films from 78 °C to 98 °C. Irrespective of the fact that 10 wt% CNC reinforced film had a lower initial storage modulus it was able to contribute to the increase in the T g of the nanocomposite film. A significant shift from 10 °C to 57 °C on addition of 6% CNC into starch matrix have been reported (Kargarzadeh et al., 2017). The increase in T g of the CNC reinforced PVA-gelatin film can be attributed to the higher surface area provided by CNC in the matrix which allows for good adhesion between the matrix and filler. This result indicates the good compatibility between the water hyacinth CNC and PVA-gelatin matrix as it acts as a good reinforcing particle to produce green composite films."
27,Effect of water on nanocomposites,"3.12 Effect of water on nanocomposites Hydrophilic materials absorb water molecules either by contact with water or from the environment. The PVA, gelatin and CNC are highly hydrophilic materials and that is one of their main disadvantages in packaging. However, this disadvantage is of great importance to facilitate the degradation of materials in an environmentally friendly manner. Their hydrophilicity is due to numerous hydroxyl groups which makes them highly polar and therefore sensitive to water molecules. The process in which water molecules are progressively mixed together with materials through chemical sorption, physical adsorption and multilayer condensation is known as water absorption (Popescu et al., 2017). The water absorption of polymer films is a vital property for evaluating their long-term performance. The water absorption results of unreinforced PVA-gelatin film and PVA-gelatin films reinforced with 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC were investigated and presented in Fig. 7 a. In the figure, where the water absorption was plotted against time, the nanocomposites absorbed maximum amount of water within the first 30 min. The unreinforced film did not exhibit any equilibrium absorption rather it gradually decreased its absorption with time. This behaviour can be attributed to immediate degradation on maximum water absorption. Unlike the unreinforced film, the 5 wt% and 10 wt% water hyacinth CNC reinforced film was able to maintain slight equilibrium water absorption for 30 min before degrading. However, after 70 min of absorption and degradation, the reinforced films maintained an equilibrium water content all through while the unreinforced film continued on its downward steep. Moreover, after 30 min the unreinforced film absorbed about 640% of its original weight while the 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced films recorded their maximum absorption at about 50 minutes absorbing 516% and 373% of their original weight respectively. Therefore, the incorporation of CNC into the blend limited its water absorption because of the formation of compact three-dimensional structure by hydrogen bonding between the polymeric matrix and the CNCs molecules. This phenomenon restricts the chain mobility, reduces the amount of free hydroxyl groups of the matrix and does not permit penetration of water through the molecular system (Belbekhouche et al., 2011; Popescu et al., 2018). It is also imperative to study the effect of saline environment on the nanocomposite films in order to observe its effect on the films for potential packaging purposes. Absorption property of the unreinforced film, 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced film in saline water were investigated and presented in Fig. 7b. The percentage absorption of the films in saline water were found to be far lower (less than 100%) than their absorption in distilled water. This can be attributed to the higher density of saline water which leads to lower absorptivity of water molecules into the matrix. In the first 5 min, the saline absorption was found to be 63%, 60% and 56% for unreinforced film, 5 wt% CNC reinforced film and 10 wt% CNC reinforced film, respectively. This lower absorption on addition of CNC also further proves that the formation of percolation network prevents swelling of the film which is accompanied by reduction in absorption. Generally, all the films reached equilibrium saline absorption within 20 min of immersion in the saline solution before inception of degradation at the 60th minute for the control sample. However, the 5 wt% CNC reinforced film sustained equilibrium for 90 min before degradation started while the 10 wt% CNC reinforced film did not show a sign of degradation within the studied period. This simply implies that the CNC reinforced films obtained in this study can be used to wrap wet saline foods for more than 2 h without its depreciation. However, the presence of ordinary water will facilitate its degradation which is an exciting attribute for environmental sustainability. In packaging application, films are expected to at least decrease vapour transfer between packaged product and surrounding atmosphere. This essential parameter is important to prevent the contamination of the packaged product or contamination of the environment by the packaged goods. The WVP of unreinforced PVA-gelatin film, 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced PVA-gelatin films were investigated and presented in Fig. 7c. The WVP of unreinforced PVA-gelatin film was found to be 2.35 × 10–6 g/(m•h•Pa) while that of 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced films decreased to 1.89 × 10–6 g/(m•h•Pa) and 1.64 × 10–6 g/(m•h•Pa), respectively. An indication that addition of CNC into the PVA-gelatin blend showed a positive effect on WVP of the resulted nanocomposite films. This decrease in WVP is attributed to the impermeable CNCs which were well dispersed in the blend matrix to form a tortuous path and to increase the effective diffusion path length for water vapour transmission (Kanmani and Rhim, 2014; Yadollahi et al., 2014; Bai et al., 2015). Interestingly, the WVP obtained in this study is slightly lower than that reported for PVA/CNC/Basil extract blend. Having WVP of 1.92 × 10–6 g/(m•h•Pa) for a blend containing 5% CNC (Singh et al., 2018). Surprisingly, this value was obtained for PVA/CNC/BE film with 1.78 mm thickness. However, the WVP value from this study is higher than that obtained by Noshirvani et al. (2018) as 15% CNC (6.79 × 10–7 g/(m•h•Pa)) was added to starch-PVA blend. Also, chitosan/gelatin plasticized with sorbitol or glycerol for edible packaging having a 0.8 mm thickness showed WVP of 3.7 × 10–11 which is far lower than values reported in this study (Arvanitoyannis et al., 1998). Moreover, thickness of films is considered to be independent of the WVP, but hydrophilic films often exhibit positive correlation relationships between thickness and water vapor permeability as a result of attractive forces between the films and water (Patricia Miranda et al., 2004). This study has shown that biodegradable films fabricated by reinforcing PVA-gelatin with water hyacinth CNC have good WVP for food packaging since convention food packaging films produced from synthetic polymers is reported to have WVP in the range of 2.3 × 1014–8.7 × 1014 g/(m•h•Pa) (Bastarrachea et al., 2011). The ability of a film to be moisture resistant is a vital property in packaging application especially food items for storage. However, the inefficient resistance to moisture is one of the weak points of PVA-gelatin films. Therefore, the addition of CNC is not only targeted at enhancing mechanical properties of the films but also to improve the moisture resistance and provide stability in high moisture environment. Moisture uptake of the films decreased with addition of CNC as illustrated in Fig. 7d. The unreinforced PVA-gelatin film had a moisture uptake of 22.50%, on addition of 5 wt% CNC, the moisture uptake reduced to 19.18% and 19.05% on addition of 10 wt% CNC. Moisture uptake has been reported to decrease from 13.8% to 10% on addition of 10% CNC to starch (Agustin et al., 2014). In another study the moisture uptake decreased from 17% to 15.7% on addition of CNC from garlic stalks into starch based biocomposite films (Agustin et al., 2013). This decrease can be attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonding between the CNC and the PVA-gelatin matrix. The formation of voids was prevented by this bonding making it difficult for moisture to pass (Cañigueral et al., 2009). A reduction in moisture uptake has also been noticed in CNC reinforced biopolymers (Agustin et al., 2014; Slavutsky and Bertuzzi, 2014). This reduced moisture uptake is advantageous for packaging ready-to-consume items since these items are mostly displayed for purchase in an uncontrolled humidity environment. The lower moisture uptake shows that the films are not hygroscopic and will be comfortable to handle by hand unlike PVA/gelatin/polyethylene glycol biodegradable films with moisture retention capability of more than 95% (Sajjan et al., 2020). The total soluble matter of the unreinforced PVA-gelatin and reinforced nanocomposites were monitored by investigating their total dissolved solid (TDS). The addition of CNCs to the PVA-gelatin matrix induced a decrease in the weight loss. The unreinforced film has a total dissolved solid of 71%, while the 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced films have 63% and 60% TDS, respectively. This reduction in film solubility can be explained by formation of strong hydrogen bond between the matrix and crystalline nanocellulose. The water sensitivity decreased, restricting the dissolution of polymeric matrix in water by forming a three-dimensional network (Islam et al., 2014). Film solubility of chitosan/PVA has been reported to be 75% which is in the same range with the control sample (Ghaderi et al., 2019). However, 30 wt% of chitosan led to 60% solubility in a similar chitosan/PVA formulation (Hajji et al., 2016), while 10 wt% CNC produced 60% solubility of the nanocomposite film. This implies that CNC may contribute more hydrophilicity to biodegradable films than chitosan since material solubility is related to its hydrophilicity (Jiang et al., 2010). Although this study is not comparing the properties of chitosan and CNC in biodegradable films, it is important to note that film formulation and composition can also affect its solubility. The stability of the films in saline water were also investigated, and the unreinforced film has a TDS of 66% in saline water while the 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced films have TDS of 42% and 40%, respectively. Solubility of the nanocomposite films are far less in saline water compared to ordinary water which means that the degradation of the films in saline environment may be reduced. It is noteworthy that the solubility of biodegradable films is directly proportional to their ability to degrade. It has also been noted (Firouzi and Nguyen, 2014) that presence of salts inhibits solubility and saline water has a high salt (NaCl) composition. Therefore, it can be inferred that these biodegradable films may take an extended period of time to degrade in sea water which is majorly saline in nature."
28,Soil degradation,"3.13 Soil degradation The conventional polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate are recognised for their persistence in the environment. Therefore, biodegradability has become an important quality when the environmental effect of polymer is considered in applications such as packaging. The biodegradation activities of the control sample, 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced PVA-gelatin films were investigated by soil burial method. The biodegradation was studied as a function of weight loss with time of burial in moist soil. Though complete degradation was not noticed within the studied time but the results obtained, presented in Fig. 8 show that the control sample degraded faster than other samples. The degradation of the nanocomposite was almost the same for the reinforced and unreinforced PVA-gelatin films after 28 d of soil burial. After the 28 d, unreinforced film had a higher degradability of 12.9% while the 5 wt% and 10 wt% CNC reinforced films recorded a biodegradation weight loss of 12.58% and 12.62%, respectively. It was observed that there was a rapid rate of degradation within the first 16 d, with the 10 wt% CNC reinforced film unexpectedly degrading more than the 5 wt% CNC reinforced film. Arguably, 5 wt% CNC may have dispersed better than 10 wt% CNC in the PVA-gelatin matrix forming a better 3-dimensional network structure. Poor dispersion leads to easy failure in the physical integrity of composites because of stress points created in their structure. However, incorporation of CNC may have slowed the biodegradation of the films but interestingly, an equilibrium degradation was not reached within the 28 d. All the films showed possibility of continued degradation if the degradation period was extended although the control film degradation rate slowed considerably falling within the same range as the reinforced films within the last 4 d. It has already been established (Goheen and Wool, 1991; Danjaji et al., 2002) that the rapid degradation of films during soil burial lasts for the first 30 d after which degradation proceeds slowly. Contrarily, projection of the chart will show that unlike the control sample that has the possibility of slowly degrading after 30 d, the reinforced films show high probability of continual rapid degradation. Though the degradation weight loss within 30 d is low, its high probability of completely biodegrading is an excellent attribute for packaging materials especially for on-the-go food packages that easily slip disposal points and litter the streets."
29,Conclusions,"Cellulose nanocrystals with 72% crystallinity and diameter ranging from 20 to 50 nm was prepared from water hyacinth fibre in order to produce and reinforce nanocomposite films using PVA and gelatin as matrix for potential packaging purposes. The central composite design was employed to study the contributions of PVA, gelatin and CNC on the mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation at break). The nanocomposite films have strength within 7–14 MPa and the elongation at break within 45%–81%. The PVA, gelatin and CNC had effect on the tensile strength while the matrices (PVA and gelatin) contributed greatly to the elongation at break. Furthermore, the thermal and dynamic mechanical properties showed improvement (increase) on addition of CNC into PVA-gelatin matrix. The thermal stability of the film was increased to 385 °C while a maximum storage modulus of 3 GPa was observed on addition of 5% CNC with a shift in the T g from 78 °C to 98 °C. The improvement in thermal properties indicates that water hyacinth CNC acted as an insulator and mass transport barrier to the volatile products generated during decomposition. Additionally, the water vapour permeability and moisture uptake of the films studied indicated a decrease in the water vapour permeability from 2.35 × 10–6 g/(m•h•Pa) to 1.64 × 10–6 g/(m•h•Pa) and the moisture uptake from 22.5% to 19.05% on addition of CNC to PVA-gelatin matrix. This improved water barrier property on the addition of CNC despite its hydrophilic nature is due to its ability to form a compact three-dimensional structure with the matrix which reduces the penetration of water molecules. Finally, the established results indicate that water hyacinth CNC reinforced PVA-gelatin films can be considered as a potential biodegradable packaging material especially for on-the-go food packages."
