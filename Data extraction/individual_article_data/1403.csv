0,Introduction,"Incessant increase in global energy consumption has raised alarms regarding demand and supply of energy resources accompanied by environmental concerns. The International Energy Agency has reported a hike of 47.7% in fuel consumption and 55.8% increase in CO2 emissions in the last two decades (IEA Statistics, 2016). Such startling statistics have driven the quest for sustainable alternative energy sources. One such prospective option is the use of biofuels such as ethanol and butanol. Simultaneous production of butanol and ethanol through fermentation is primarily carried out by the bacteria of genus Clostridium with C. acetobutylicum being the most widely used (Dürre, 2007; Lee et al., 2008; Jones and Woods, 1986). However, lower butanol titers with limited ethanol production and narrow substrate utilization range of the existing Clostridium strains have motivated the search for novel cell factories. In a recent study, the authors have reported substrate dependent modulation of butanol and ethanol production in non-acetone forming strain Clostridium sporogenes NCIM 2918 (Kaushal et al., 2017). It was shown that the changes in substrate combinations and variation in the ratio of concentration of the dual substrates has significant effect not only on the distribution pattern of butanol and ethanol, but also on total alcohol titer (Kaushal et al., 2017). Despite being extensively explored in the field of medical microbiology for therapeutic applications (Poehlein et al., 2015), exploitation of C. sporogenes in biofuel research is still at a very nascent stage. Moreover, the alcohol titers required to achieve industrial feasibility are not attained due to solvent toxicity and in part due to competition for electrons amongst the pathways for major reduced end products (Claassen et al., 2011; Kaushal et al., 2017). Therefore, understanding the modulation in its central metabolism when exposed to different carbohydrates will be helpful in finding targets for metabolic and process engineering strategies to direct carbon and electron fluxes towards the desired pathways. Fluxes, the outcome of non-linear interactions among genes, proteins and metabolite concentrations (Sauer, 2006) are considered to be the fundamental determinants of the metabolic phenotype under a given condition (Stephanopoulos, 1999). Therefore, while gene expression data or protein levels or metabolite concentrations alone cannot be the reliable indicators of metabolic phenotype (Sauer, 2006), quantification of carbon flux distribution in the metabolic network is crucial to understand the complex interplay between genotypic alterations and the corresponding phenotypic responses (Shastri and Morgan 2005; Boyle and Morgan 2009). Estimation of carbon fluxes by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is achieved by maximizing or minimizing a biologically relevant objective with pseudo steady state approximation for the metabolites (Orth et al., 2010). Since the first genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli appeared (Edwards and Palsson, 2000), similar reconstructions have also been carried out for six different Clostridium spp. namely C. acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. butyricum, C. cellulolyticum, C. ljungdahlii and C. thermocellum (Lee et al., 2008; Senger and Papoutsakis, 2008; Salimi et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2010; Cai et al., 2010; Milne et al., 2011; Nagarajan et al., 2013). However, as there are very few reports on C. sporogenes as a cell factory for biofuel production, there have been null attempts at modelling of its metabolism in this regard. In the present study, FBA was carried out for the strain to understand the modulation of carbon flux distribution towards alcohol biosynthesis with the change in type of carbon sources and their concentrations in a mixture. Further, a change in intracellular carbon flux distribution was predicted during metabolic shift from acidogenic phase to solventogenic phase. The analysis involved reconstruction of metabolic network followed by estimation of carbon fluxes via linear programming optimization. Validation of the model was carried out by comparing the experimental values obtained for specific growth rate or carbon flux towards butanol formation to the corresponding model predicted values."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Organism and cultivation conditions,"2.1 Organism and cultivation conditions C. sporogenes NCIM 2918 was procured from National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (NCIM), India and stored as glycerol stocks at −80 °C. Revival of glycerol stock and seed preparation was carried out as mentioned by Kaushal et al. (2017). The anaerobic condition was achieved and maintained by purging nitrogen (99.99% pure) prior to inoculation and at regular intervals respectively. Resazurin (1 g L−1), a redox indicator dye, was used to ensure anaerobicity throughout the fermentation. 6 h old 20% (v/v) seed culture was used as inoculum for batch cultivation of the organism. Experiments were carried out in P2 media (Monot et al., 1982) comprising of (in g L−1) instant dried yeast 56.6, K2HPO4 0.50, KH2PO4 0.50, CH3COONH4 2.2, para-amino-benzoic acid 0.01, biotin 0.001, MgSO4·7H2O 0.22, MnSO4·H2O 0.011, FeSO4·7H2O 0.011, NaCl 0.011. Carbon source blend was added to the media in six different glucose-glycerol ratios of 100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80 and 0:100 in such a manner that the total initial carbon content was equal to 2.26 M as prescribed for optimized media (Kaushal et al., 2017). Carbon source(s) were autoclaved separately and added aseptically in the desired ratio. Prior to inoculation, the seed culture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in order to remove any residual carbon which might alter the composition of carbon source(s). Batch fermentation was carried out at 37 °C in static condition and sampling was done at regular intervals for analysis of biomass, substrate utilization and product formation. All the experiments were conducted in duplicate and the values were measured as mean ± standard error."
3,Flux balance analysis,"2.2 Flux balance analysis The FBA involved reconstruction of metabolic network containing essential biochemical reactions followed by mathematical representation of the stoichiometric coefficients of each reaction in the form of a matrix termed as stoichiometric model. These coefficients impose constraints on the fluxes through the metabolic network. The stoichiometric model was then solved using linear programming (Muthuraj et al., 2013) with a suitable objective function. Mass balance was carried out for all the metabolites involved in various reactions with the exception of protons (Montagud et al., 2010) and water molecules. The FBA was based on pseudo steady state assumption (Manish et al., 2007) for the metabolites (Eq. (1)) where the metabolic model was converted to the stoichiometric model as follows (Stephanopoulos, 1999). (1) S · v = 0 S was the stoichiometric matrix of dimension m × n containing stoichiometric coefficient of m metabolites in n reactions. v was the flux vector that corresponded to the flux of n reactions (Orth et al., 2010; Hendry et al., 2016). In the present study, the dimension of the stoichiometric matrix was 152 × 206 with 54 (n-m) as the degree of freedom (f). Since the no unknowns are more then than the degree of freedom (n > f), system is underdetermined and hence necessitates the use of linear optimization for solving this matrix. Clostridium spp. are known to exhibit a biphasic fermentation comprising of an early acidogenic phase marked by faster growth rate of the organism and formation of acids predominantly, followed by a solventogenic phase marked with slower growth rate, re-assimilation of acids and subsequent solvent production. With the aim of capturing changes in flux distribution during this metabolic shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis, FBA was carried out at 7 h and 18 h of cultivation respectively. Flux analysis at 7 h and 18 h was performed using maximization of biomass (Mµ) and maximization of butanol (MB) as objective function respectively. For flux analysis in acidogenic phase, the model inputs were experimentally determined uptake rates for glucose, glycerol, acetic acid & butyric acid and formation rate of acetic acid, butyric acid, succinic acid, ethanol & butanol. For analysis in solventogenic phase, uptake rates of glucose, glycerol, acetic acid & butyric acid, specific growth rate and formation rate of acetic acid, butyric acid & ethanol were considered as model inputs. It is important to mention here that out of 15 exchange reactions, 10 were experimentally determined and these fixed flux values were used as input for the model. For other exchange compounds, lower and upper flux values were provided. The FBA was carried out for both acidogenic and solventogenic phase of the fermentation while grown on sole glucose, sole glycerol and mixture of glucose-glycerol at different concentration ratios. An inbuilt routine in MATLAB (MATHWORK, Natick, MA) ‘fmincon’ was used to solve stoichiometric model based on linear programming optimization."
4,Reconstruction of metabolic network,"2.3 Reconstruction of metabolic network C. sporogenes NCIMB 10696 genome annotated in KEGG database was used as the primary source for reconstruction of metabolic network for C. sporogenes. Nevertheless, other databases such as MetaCyc (Caspi et al., 2012) and SEED (Overbeek et al., 2005) were used for enzymes that were not annotated in KEGG. Finally, BLAST searches were undertaken for those enzymes which were not present in any of the above databases. In spite of yielding low scores, some of these enzymes were added to the network for gap filling. Schematic representation of the major pathways in C. sporogenes is shown in Fig.1 . In the present study, FBA was performed with glycerol as a sole carbon source or in combination with glucose. Therefore, the pathway for glycerol metabolism was also included in the metabolic network from the annotations given in MetaCyc database. C. sporogenes, like other clostridial spp. uses glycolytic pathway to catabolize glucose to pyruvate which is further converted into acetylCoA and CO2, a reaction catalyzed by pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Poehlein et al., 2015). This conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is also linked with hydrogen production which is significant in maintaining redox balance in clostridial spp. The enzymes involved are ferredoxin: NAD(P)H oxidoreductase and hydrogenase which catalyze the oxidation of ferredoxin coupled with reduction of NAD(P)+ and hydrogen production respectively (Jones and Woods, 1986). Although ferredoxin: NADH oxidoreductase is not annotated in clostridial genome databases, it is postulated to be one of the key enzymes of redox balancing pathway (Yoo et al., 2015). Therefore, this reaction was incorporated in the model and was considered reversible (Fig. 1) as evident from various experimental data (Gheshlaghi et al., 2009). Enzymatic analyses in C. pasteurianum, C. butyricum and C. acetobutylicum have reported activities of both NADH: ferredoxin oxidoreductase and ferredoxin: NAD reductase which catalyze reduction of ferredoxin by NADH and the reverse reaction i.e., the reduction of NAD by ferredoxin respectively (Gheshlaghi et al., 2009). Owing to the lack of oxidative phosphorylation pathway, it has been assumed that the main function of NADPH: ferredoxin oxidoreductase is to generate NADPH (Jungermann et al., 1973). Taking this hypothesis into account, along with observation of low specific activity of NADPH: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Gheshlaghi et al., 2009), the directionality of reactions involved in the oxidation of ferredoxin coupled with reduction of NADP+ was considered irreversible (Fig. 1). Solventogenic phase in clostridia encompasses solvent production and acid reutilization, which in case of C. acetobutylicum is coupled with acetone formation (Jones and Woods, 1986). Genome of C. sporogenes lacks the sequence encoding for both the enzymes, acetoacetyl-CoA: acetate/butyrate: CoA transferase and acetoacetate decarboxylase, which catalyze acid reutilization and acetone formation respectively (Poehlein et al., 2015). However, during batch fermentation acid reutilization was observed while acetone formation was not detected. It was hypothesized that in case of C. sporogenes, acetic acid and butyric acid reutilization take place only via phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (PTA-AK) and phosphotransbutyrylase-butyrate kinase (PTB-BK) mediated pathway respectively. Therefore, the enzymes for PTA-AK and PTB-BK pathway were considered reversible (Fig. 1). The final reactions towards alcoholic products were catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme though contrasting results have been put forth regarding its cofactor (NADH or NADPH) requirements (Gheshlaghi et al., 2009). Substrate requirement for NADH generation is equal to that for NADPH formation (Villadsen et al., 2011). Therefore, the overall substrate consumed for alcohol production using either of the cofactors is same. Considering this, for the purpose of simplification, we have considered only one common representative NADH for both of them. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is an important part of clostridial metabolism as it provides essential precursors such as ribose-5-phosphate and erythrose-4-phosphate for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis. Production of ribose-5-phosphate can be achieved via oxidative PPP from glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) or nonoxidative PPP from fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). 13C based studies carried out in C. acetobutylicum revealed that oxidative route of PPP is absent (Crown et al., 2011). Consistent with above results we also observed the lack of oxidative pentose phosphate pathway enzyme homologues in the C. sporogenes genome and hence the oxidative reactions were not included in the metabolic network. PPP is carried out through non-oxidative route catalyzed by transketolase and transaldolase enzymes. Clostridial energy generation takes place through substrate level phosphorylation as they lack electron transport chain. Therefore, absence of oxidative phosphorylation renders the main objective of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as production of precursors for amino acids. As observed in other Clostridium spp, C. sporogenes also exhibited a broken TCA cycle, which was evident from missing annotations for citrate synthase, succinyl-CoA synthetase and a fumarate reductase enzyme. The TCA cycle in the model was completed based on recent report of 13C experiments for C. acetobutylicum pointing towards existence of a bifurcated TCA cycle resulting in succinate secretion (Amador-Noguez et al., 2010; Crown et al., 2011). An ortholog (CAC0970) to a Re-face stereospecific citrate synthase of C. kluyveri was found in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (Crown et al., 2011) which catalyzes condensation reaction of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to citrate. BLAST search of C. sporogenes NCIMB 10696 genome with the nucleotide sequence of CAC0970 resulted in 74% similarity suggesting the presence of a similar ortholog in C. sporogenes (Locus tag CLSPO_c04550). Enzymes catalyzing subsequent TCA cycle reactions are annotated in the genome except succinyl-CoA synthetase and fumarate reductase and therefore, the reactions involving them were added in the model based on literature. Directionality of fumarate reductase catalyzed reaction was considered irreversible (Fig. 1) based on the study carried out by Crown et al. (2011). On the contrary, succinyl-CoA synthetase was considered reversible (Fig. 1) since the rate of succinate secretion in fermentation broth observed in the current study was very low and this could be attributed to the reconversion of succinate to succinyl-CoA (Senger and Papoutsakis, 2008; Au et al., 2014). The genes encoding CoA transferase catalyzing this reconversion is yet to be identified in clostridial spp. (Au et al., 2014). Beside TCA cycle, few more non gene associated reactions belonging to key biosynthetic pathways of amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids and carbohydrates were also included in the network. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is another important enzyme in folate cycle responsible for DNA synthesis but its sequence is not annotated in any of the three databases. DHFR gene sequence in C. botulinum showed a 91% similarity against the genomic DNA of C. sporogenes NCIMB 10696. Similar sequence hit was found for fatty acid synthesis enzyme phosphatidylglycerophosphatase. The key difference between the constructed model and the published models of other Clostridium species is that this is the first model mimicking BE (Butanol-Ethanol) fermentation. The earlier published models were for ABE (Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol) fermentation in case of C. acetobutylicum (Lee et al., 2008; Senger and Papoutsakis, 2008) and C. beijerinckii (Milne et al., 2011), ethanol fermentation in case of C. butyricum (Cai et al., 2010), C. cellulolyticum (Salimi et al., 2010), C. thermocellum (Roberts et al., 2010), and C. ljungdahlii (Nagarajan et al., 2013) and 1,3-propanediol fermentation in case of C. pasteurianum (Sarma et al., 2017)."
5,Biomass composition,"2.4 Biomass composition The biomass composition was based on optimized equation developed for C. acetobutylicum (Senger and Papoutsakis, 2008) and was assumed to constitute DNA, RNA, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid. The equation for protein, DNA and RNA composition was adopted from Lee et al., (2008). Lipid and peptidoglycan compositions were kept same as reported by Dash et al. (2014) for C. acetobutylicum with hexadeconic acid chosen as fatty acid representative (Senger and Papoutsakis, 2008). Carbohydrate composition was based on glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) which was assumed similar across species (Muthuraj et al., 2013) while equation for cell wall and lipoteichoic acid formation were adopted from McAnulty et al. (2012) and Senger and Papoutsakis (2008) respectively."
6,Measureable external fluxes,"2.5 Measureable external fluxes In order to simulate the microbial growth, certain additional constraints such as maximum nutrient consumption rate and product formation rate were included in the model. Biomass growth was measured in terms of optical density (OD) at 600 nm using UV–visible spectrophotometer (Cary 50, Varian, Australia) as described by Kaushal et al. (2017). The OD was converted into dry cell weight (DCW) using the calibration equation 1 OD = 0.328 g L - 1 DCW . The substrates, organic acids and solvents were measured in high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, LC-20AD, Shimadzu, Japan) as described by Kaushal et al. (2017). ATP utilization was considered in two forms: Growth associated (GA) and non-growth associated (NGA) maintenance energy. The GA maintenance energy, required during biomass synthesis, was kept constant as 40 mmol ATP g−1 DCW (Lee et al., 2008; Senger and Papoutsakis, 2008). Value for NGA maintenance energy was determined by fitting the model predicted fluxes to experimental data."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Substrate dependent modulation of butanol to ethanol ratio and total alcohol titer,"3.1 Substrate dependent modulation of butanol to ethanol ratio and total alcohol titer In our previous study, substrate dependent modulation of butanol to ethanol ratio and total alcohol titer was reported for the strain C. sporogenes NCIM 2918 when grown on glucose or glycerol as sole carbon source or in combination with varied glucose-glycerol ratio (Kaushal et al., 2017). Therefore, it was of interest to examine the flexibility of its metabolic network when grown on different carbon sources. This is particularly important in view of critical balance of the cofactor ratios such as that of NADH/NAD+, NADPH/NADP+ and Fdred/Fdox, as optimal allocation of these resources eventually ascertains the fate of the final products. To that end, batch fermentation was carried out with samples being drawn at shorter time intervals to capture the transient changes in the metabolism with the changes in metabolic phase of the fermentation. When grown on glucose as sole carbon source, production of butyric acid (6.9 g L−1) was found to be dominant, followed by butanol (4.6 g L−1) and ethanol (3.2 g L−1). Interestingly, a completely different product distribution pattern was observed when glycerol was used as the sole carbon source. Ethanol synthesis was found to be significantly elevated with a titer of 14.7 g L−1 followed by butanol (4 g L−1). It is important to note that supplementation of glycerol to glucose in different ratios resulted in significant variation of butanol and ethanol titer. For instance, with the increase in glycerol concentration in the sugar mixture, production of ethanol was found to be upregulated while, butanol titer increased up to glucose-glycerol ratio of 60:40 and decreased. Further, with the change in substrate composition the total alcohol titer was found to vary from 7.9 g L−1 to 24 g L−1, with maximum obtained for glucose to glycerol ratio of 60:40. These results point towards existence of inherent metabolic versatility and adaptability of the organism in response to the change in substrate composition. In order to understand the underlying regulation governing this metabolic flexibility we conducted flux balance analysis for different glucose-glycerol combinations."
9,"Flux distribution of C. sporogenes NCIM 2918 when grown on glucose, glycerol and glucose-glycerol dual substrate combination","3.2 Flux distribution of C. sporogenes NCIM 2918 when grown on glucose, glycerol and glucose-glycerol dual substrate combination FBA was performed to determine the distribution of intracellular carbon flux at 7 h of cultivation on glucose, glycerol and glucose-glycerol mixture (Fig.2 A, 3 A and 4 A). Among the different glucose-glycerol ratios studied, the highest individual and total alcohol titer was achieved for the ratio of 60:40. Therefore, in order to compare flux distribution under dual substrate to that of single carbon source, glucose-glycerol ratio of 60:40 was considered. Comparison of model predicted and experimentally obtained specific growth rates at 7 h of cultivation exhibited a similarity of 90.6%, 91.6% and 91.3% for glucose, glycerol and glucose-glycerol (60:40) mixture. In case of growth on glucose, the flux distribution in central metabolic pathway initiated with glucose uptake and first catabolic flux partitioning took place at G6P node. From G6P node while majority of the incoming flux (98.96%) was directed toward glycolysis pathway (Fig. 2A), remaining flux was channeled toward G1P, which was further bifurcated into major cell wall constituent lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and storage carbohydrates (Muthuraj et al., 2013). Next carbon flux partitioning occurred at the F6P node between glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Fig. 2A) which mostly provides biosynthetic precursors for the synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids. 13C metabolic flux analysis of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 showed similar flux bifurcations at the F6P node (glycolysis—98 ± 0.1% and PPP—0.9 ± 0.1%) for growth on glucose (Au et al., 2014). Flux distribution at 7 h of cultivation on glycerol started with fixing glycerol in the form of glycerone (GL) which was then converted into glycerone phosphate (GLP) (Fig. 3A). From GLP node, carbon flux was further diverted into three branches: glycolytic (via GAP node), lipid biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis pathways (Fig. 3A). During glycerol metabolism, of total flux at the pyruvate node (93.8%), 3.66% was streamed into the TCA cycle while remaining 86.25% towards the acetyl CoA formation node. Further from the acetyl CoA node (ACCA) maximum flux (48.91%) was diverted for ethanol synthesis, followed by 16.48% being dissipated towards butyryl CoA formation node. At the BUCOA node, flux was partitioned between butyric acid (9.87%) and butanol formation (6.6%). For dual substrate combination of glucose and glycerol, the total carbon uptake was divided into 34.61% glucose and 65.40% glycerol (Fig. 4A). Of the total carbon uptake, glucose flux was distributed between polysaccharide formation (0.66%), PPP (0.94%) and glycolysis (32.51%) while glycerol flux bifurcated into lipid formation (1.30%) and glycolysis (64.10%). The combined flux (128.19%) from both glucose and glycerol uptake coincided at the GAP node which was further streamed into the glycolysis pathway. Pyruvate metabolism had an input flux of 125.73% which fed the TCA cycle with 5.65% flux through the anapleurotic reaction while 115.11% was diverted to acetyl CoA synthesis. Further from the acetyl CoA node (ACCA) maximum flux (50.08%) was diverted for butyryl CoA formation node, followed by 23.29% being dissipated towards ethanol synthesis. At the BUCOA node, flux was partitioned between butyric acid (38.03%) and butanol formation (12.05%). This carbon partitioning observed at the ACCA and BUCOA node was similar to that seen for glucose. During glucose metabolism, 1.87% and 9.22% of the initial carbon uptake flux was fed into TCA cycle (Fig. 2A) via acetyl-CoA (ACCA) and pyruvate (anaplerotic reaction) node respectively. While both oxidative and reductive branch of the TCA cycle was found to be active, they were weakly connected as observed from insignificant flux (≤0.01) between α-ketoglutarate and succinyl-CoA or between succinate and fumarate (Fig. 2A). Fate of succinate, whether it will be secreted into media or will be converted into succinyl-CoA, depends upon succinyl-CoA requirement for growth as part of lysine and methionine biosynthesis (Au et al., 2014). During glucose metabolism, 1.53% flux was diverted towards succinyl-CoA while minimal carbon flux of <0.1% was directed towards succinate secretion (Fig. 2A), which is in consonance with the results of Au et al. (2014). Lack of oxidative phosphorylation (Crown et al., 2011; Amador-Noguez et al., 2010) narrows the role of TCA cycle as producer of precursors of biosynthetically important metabolites (Lee et al., 2016). This is achieved by independently operating oxidative and reductive branches (Au et al., 2014). In the oxidative branch, the key target metabolite is α-ketoglutarate, involved in the biosynthesis of various amino acids (Nelson and Cox, 1992). The reductive branch operates from oxaloacetate to fumarate via aspartate exclusively as part of arginine biosynthesis (Au et al., 2014). It is important to note that unlike glucose fermentation the reductive branch of the TCA cycle in case of glycerol was found to be connected with the succinate synthesis pathway with 0.23% flux contributing towards conversion of fumarate to succinate (Fig. 3A). TCA cycle flux distribution under glucose-glycerol dual substrate fermentation followed a similar pattern as glycerol metabolism with notable flux (>0.1) in all the branches with the exception of zero flux for the reaction catalyzing conversion of α-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA reaction (Fig. 4A). Presence of glucose as sole carbon source or in dual substrate mixture resulted in improved growth of the organism as compared to glycerol alone. This improved growth is linked to the elevated demand for ATP which in turn is satisfied by the upregulated carbon flux towards butyric acid synthesis pathway as an additional source of ATP along with glycolysis (Fig. 2A and 4A, Table 1 ). Interestingly, when grown on glycerol the organism showed distinct phenotypic response in terms of reduced growth and butyric acid formation (Fig. 3A). In a recent study, the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase was shown to be repressed in C. pasteurianum with the increase in glycerol concentration in a dual substrate combination of glucose-glycerol (Sabra et al., 2016). The anaplerotic reaction catalyzed by this enzyme acts as the supply line of carbon flux from glycolysis to TCA cycle. Therefore, downregulated expression of this enzyme in presence of glycerol results in downturn of carbon uptake flux towards TCA cycle which in turn negatively affects the growth of the organism. In the present study, a similar downregulation (Fig. 5 A) in carbon flux towards anaplerotic reaction was observed in case of glycerol (Fig. 3A and 3B) as compared to glucose (Fig. 2A and 2B) or mixture of glucose-glycerol (Fig. 4A and 4B). Further, a reduced butyric acid flux in case of glycerol may be attributed to this reduced growth resulting in lower ATP demand (Table 1). In all three substrate combinations, while ethanol flux was found to be substantial, flux towards butanol formation was minimal in the early phase (7 h) of the fermentation. Addition of acetic acid was reported to alter expression level or cause inactivity of the enzymes responsible for acetic acid production in C. acetobutylicum (Kumar et al., 2014). Hence, presence of acetic acid in the form of ammonium acetate in the production media might be the reason for early induction of acetic acid utilization with no flux in acetic acid production for all three substrate combinations (Figs. 2A–4B and Fig. 5G). Formation of acetyl-CoA via utilization of acetate is uncoupled with the formation of NADH unlike the acetyl-CoA generated through glycolysis. Hence, the organism chose to metabolize this excess acetyl-CoA to lesser reduced products such as butyric acid (in high glucose containing blend) or ethanol (in high glycerol containing blend) as compared to butanol (Jones and Woods, 1986). Metabolism of glycerol results in excess NADH pool as compared to glucose. Therefore, in case of glucose, the additional requirement of NADH was satisfied through NAD: ferredoxin oxidoreductase reaction (Fig. 2A, Table 2 ). While, in case of glycerol or glucose-glycerol mixture, NADH: ferredoxin oxidoreductase mediated transfer of electrons from NADH to reduced ferredoxin balanced the surplus NADH generated through glycolysis (Figs. 3A and 4A, Table 2). This reduced ferredoxin in turn was used to generate molecular hydrogen by action of hydrogenase. Whereas, during glucose fermentation, reduced carbon flux through NADH: ferredoxin oxidoreductase explains the decreased hydrogen flux compared to glycerol and glucose-glycerol mixture at 7 h of fermentation (Fig. 5H). This is in support of the study conducted by Trchounian et al. (2017) where an increase in specific activity of hydrogenase enzyme was reported when C. beijerinckii DSM 791 cells were grown on glycerol as compared to glucose, as the sole carbon source."
10,Changes in flux distribution during metabolic shift from acidogenic phase to solventogenic phase,"3.3 Changes in flux distribution during metabolic shift from acidogenic phase to solventogenic phase Changes in intracellular flux distribution during metabolic shift from acidogenic phase to solventogenic phase of the cultivation was captured by performing FBA at 18 h of growth and comparing with the flux values at 7 h. Model predicted flux towards butanol formation showed a reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental values at 18 h of cultivation. Unlike C. acetobutylicum, which exhibits typical biphasic fermentation, C. sporogenes NCIM 2918 showed mixed mode of fermentation without distinct acidogenic and solventogenic phase. However, the attribute, which differentiates 18 h of cultivation from that of 7 h, was different distribution pattern of carbon flux towards synthesis of alcohols and acids. For instance, while grown on glucose, cultivation at 18 h was marked with significantly elevated carbon flux towards butanol synthesis pathway with concomitant decrease in carbon flux towards production of ethanol, acids and growth as compared to 7 h. Similar results were reported by Amador-Noguez et al. (2011) during their study conducted on C. acetobutylicum where quantitative flux modeling was carried out to understand the transition from acidogenesis to solventogenesis. On the contrary, completely different product distribution pattern was observed during a metabolic shift from 7 h of fermentation to 18 h when grown on glycerol (Fig. 3A and B). At 18 h, the organism showed a divergence in carbon flux from growth to ethanol synthesis pathway without any significant difference in flux for butanol synthesis. In case of glucose-glycerol mixture, a significant upregulation in alcohol biosynthesis flux was observed at 18 h of fermentation as compared to 7 h (Fig. 4A and B). One of the most striking differences noted during metabolic shift from 7 h to 18 h of cultivation in case of glucose compared to glycerol and sugar mixture was the absence of butyric acid reutilization (Fig. 5F). In various Clostridium spp. anabolic reactions such as biosynthesis of lipids, amino acids, fatty acids and amino sugars are catalyzed by the NADPH dependent enzymes (Jones and Woods, 1986). In order to fulfill this requirement of NADPH, ferredoxin NADP+ reductase enzyme reaction was found to be highly active during early phase (7 h) of growth on all substrate combinations (Figs. 2A, 3A, 4A and Table 2). However, at the latter phase of fermentation (18 h), flux through this reaction decreased due to reduced growth (Figs. 2B, 3B, 4B and Table 2). Conversely, NAD+ reductase flux increased substantially (Table 2) which could be due to higher requirement of NADH towards elevated synthesis of butanol and/or ethanol mediated by NADH-dependent enzymes in the later phase of the fermentation. At 18 h of fermentation, a decreased hydrogen flux was observed as compared to 7 h for all the cases which could be attributed to increased alcohol formation flux as a sink for NADH and hence, eliminating the need of NADH: ferredoxin oxidoreductase pathway to balance surplus NADH. An increased NGA maintenance energy was observed at 18 h as compared to 7 h of growth for glucose, glycerol and glucose-glycerol. This requirement of higher NGA maintenance energy in the later phase of growth may be attributed to the various cellular maintenance operations essential for cell survival and adaptation to butanol stress (Muthuraj et al., 2013; Kaushal et al., 2017)."
11,Flux distribution under different glucose-glycerol ratio in dual substrate cultivation,"3.4 Flux distribution under different glucose-glycerol ratio in dual substrate cultivation Flux distribution for glucose, glycerol and glucose-glycerol (60:40) ratio is shown in Figs. 2–4 respectively. In the growth phase (7 h), with the increase in glycerol fraction in the mixed substrate, flux towards succinate secretion was found to increase linearly coupled with a downfall in butyric acid formation (Fig. 5B). This increase in succinate flux may be attributed to the reduced flux towards conversion of succinate to succinyl CoA, which in turn was a result of lower flux in lysine and methionine biosynthesis pathway owing to decreased biomass formation. As mentioned earlier, reduction in butyric acid flux (Fig. 5C) with the increase in glycerol concentration may be attributed to this reduced growth resulting in lower ATP requirement. At both 7 h and 18 h of cultivation, with the increase in glycerol contribution to the substrate blend, linear increment in flux diverted to ethanol synthesis was observed along with simultaneous decrease in butanol flux (Fig. 5D–E). Reduction in butanol flux at 18 h of cultivation is correlated to the decrease in flux towards butyric acid reutilization (Fig. 5E–F). Similar reduction in butanol flux at 7 h may be explained by the organism’s preference to metabolize excess acetyl-CoA as a result of acetic acid utilization (Fig. 5G) to a lesser reduced product such as ethanol (Fig. 5D) instead of butanol (detail in Section 3.2). This is in support to the study conducted by Wang et al. (2013) where supplementation of butyric acid to the culture medium resulted in improved butanol formation by C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. On the other hand, Kumar et al. (2014) noted that ethanol producing elementary modes in C. acetobutylicum were associated with acetic acid utilization and were independent of butyric acid consumption. Therefore, a decreasing butanol flux can be directly correlated to reduced butyric acid reutilization flux while increasing ethanol formation flux is a reflection of increased acetic acid consumption. This explains the selective upregulation of ethanol production over butanol during glycerol fermentation."
12,Conclusion,"FBA was performed for C. sporogenes NCIM 2918 to understand substrate dependent modulation of growth and alcohol biosynthesis while varying carbon source types and their concentrations in a mixture. Elevated ATP demand due to improved growth was satisfied by upregulated carbon flux towards butyric acid synthesis during glucose and glucose-glycerol fermentations. Possible repression of pyruvate carboxylase resulting in lower carbon flux towards TCA cycle through anaplerotic reaction may be responsible for reduced growth in glycerol fermentation. Ammonium acetate mediated induction of acetic acid utilization, during acidogenesis, led to excess acetyl-CoA generation and its subsequent metabolism to butyric acid or ethanol."
