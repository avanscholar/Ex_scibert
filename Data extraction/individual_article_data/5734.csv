0,Introduction,"Linear α-olefins (LAOs), which have double bonds at the end of a linear carbon chain, are useful raw materials for various petrochemicals such as co-monomers of polyethylene or poly α-olefin, synthetic lubricants, detergents, and drilling fluids. Hence, the demand for LAOs in the world market is steadily increasing [1]. The demand is especially high for 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene, which are used as co-monomers for linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and engineering polymers such as plastomers and elastomers [2,3]. LAOs in a wide carbon range (C4–C30) could be simultaneously produced through ethylene oligomerization reaction [4,5]. However, this so-called full-range LAO process has lower selectivity for products with a higher carbon number (C6+), thus it requires a complex rear separation process. As an alternative to the full-range process, the development of LAO production technologies through the on-purpose process has gained considerable attention. One example is producing 1-butene through C4-raffinate at the rear of the steam cracker, and some ethylene dimerization processes are commercialized. However, in the case of C6+ LAOs, the few commercial processes are still in the development stage [6]. 1-Hexene is produced by Chevron Phillips, Axens, and Lummus based on ethylene trimerization. The ethylene tetramerization process for 1-octene production is only commercialized by Sasol. In addition, Sasol produces octanol through hydroformylation reaction and hydrogenation reaction of 1-heptene extracted in the Fischer-Tropsch stream. The final step in the Sasol process is the dehydration of octanol to produce 1-octene. However, dioctyl ether (DOE) is also generated as a by-product, along with octene isomers having the double bond in the interior of the carbon chain. The separation of DOE from 1-octene is relatively easy, as their boiling points differ by more than 100 °C. On the other hand, the boiling point difference between 1-octene and its isomers (cis- and trans-octenes) is as little as 1–2 °C, and their other physical properties are also similar, which complicates the separation process. Therefore, new catalysts for 1-octanol dehydration with high 1-octene selectivity and less isomer production are strongly preferred. The catalytic reactivity in alcohol dehydration depends on the property of acidic sites as active sites. Kim et al. [7] reported that the acid site on the surface of Al2O3 catalyst was closely involved in 1-octanol conversion during its dehydration reaction. Previous studies reported similar effects of the acidic properties of Al2O3 and SiO-Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydration of isopropanol [8] and 1-butanol [9,10]. However, highly acidic catalysts such as SiO2-Al2O3 and zeolite generate a high fraction of isomers in alcohol dehydration, because the acidic sites re-adsorb the produced 1-alkene for further isomerization reaction [11]. Therefore, the key to high LAO selectivity in alcohol dehydration is controlling the acidic properties of the catalyst. According to the report by Davis et al. [12,13], there is an intimate correlation between the base strength of metal oxide and the selectivity for the 1-alkene (Hofmann product). They observed that compared to unmodified Al2O3, Al2O3 modified with alkali metal showed different ratios of cis/trans and 2-octene/1-octene in 2-octanol dehydration. The reason is that the basicity of metal oxide affects the tendency of OH dehydration. In addition, adding alkali metals (K and Li) to Al2O3 and ThO2 could change the acid properties in the catalysts and lead to higher 1-alkene selectivity [12]. In another study, γ-Al2O3 catalysts impregnated with Mg2+ and Na+ showed improved 1-alkene selectivity by reducing the intermediate acidity on the catalyst surface [9]. In this study, we investigated the effect of barium, another alkaline earth metal, on the acidic properties of Al2O3 catalyst, in the hope of inhibiting octene isomer formation during 1-octanol dehydration."
1,Experimental,
2,Ba/Al2O3 catalyst preparation,"2.1 Ba/Al2O3 catalyst preparation The spherical particles of Al2O3 (d = 1 mm, Sasol) contained the following elemental impurities: 0.020% Si, 0.015% Fe, 0.015% Ti, and 0.002% Na. After pre-calcinating the particles at 500 °C for 6 h in air, 0.5 – 3.0 wt% Ba was loaded by the incipient wetness impregnation method using barium nitrite (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) as a precursor. The prepared catalyst was heated overnight at 110 °C to remove water, and then calcined at 500 °C for 4 h in air."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, ELAN DRC II, Perlan-Elmer) was carried out to confirm the loaded Ba content. Each sample was pretreated in a mixed solution of 7 ml 70% HNO3 and 3 ml 35% HCl at 200 °C for 30 min using a microwave system (Milestone, Ethos 1). The crystal structure of the catalysts was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rimaxaku’s Dmax-2500pc, Cu Kα radiation) analysis. The 2θ measurement range was from 15° to 100° at a scan speed of 2°/min with a step size of 0.02°. The Al2O3 crystal phases were identified according to International Centre of Diffraction Data (ICDD). The surface areas and pore size distribution of catalysts were respectively examined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, using a BELSORP-max (BEL Japan, Inc.). CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) measurement was performed using a BELCAT-B (BEL Japan, Inc.) system to assess the basicity of prepared catalysts. The sample (50 mg) was preheated with 5 vol% O2/He gas at 300 °C for 3 h to remove adsorbed species from the catalyst surface, and then cooled down to 50 °C. CO2 adsorption was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min in 10 vol% CO2/He, and weakly adsorbed CO2 was removed by purging with He. Thereafter, the sample was heated from 50 to 500 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min under He gas, and the desorbed CO2 was quantified by integrating the profile recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Pyridine-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (py.-DRIFT) was performed to evaluate the acid sites on the prepared catalysts. Pyridine as a basic molecule was used as the probe gas, because it selectively adsorbs on the acidic site, and the strength of the acid site could be analyzed according to the bonding of adsorbed pyridine molecules. The data of py.-DRIFT were scanned at 4 cm−1 using a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and averaged over 128 scans. The spectrometer was equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector and a praying mantis DRIFTS diffuse reflectance attachment (Harrick) with a ZnSe window in the reaction chamber. The sample (20 mg) was pretreated in 5 vol% O2/He gas at 400 °C for 1 h to remove carbonyl compounds and water. Afterwards, pyridine adsorption was carried out with 1 vol% pyridine/He at 100 °C for 1 h, and the sample was purged to desorb the weakly bound pyridine. The background (without pyridine) and the pyridine-adsorbed catalysts were measured in He atmosphere at 100 °C for 30 min."
4,Catalytic reaction test,"2.3 Catalytic reaction test 1-Octanol dehydration over Ba/Al2O3 catalyst was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor system (Fig. S1). A quartz tube (9.5 mm diameter, 522 mm length) reactor was used, and the total length of the packed bed was 51 mm. SiC (2 g, 1 mm, Goodfellow Corp.) was loaded up and down the catalyst (0.6 g) bed for sufficient vaporization and uniform distribution of 1-octanol. The temperature of the catalyst layer was controlled with the thermocouple placed at the center of the catalyst bed. The reaction temperature was raised at the rate of 5 °C/min using N2 flow. After the injection of 1-octanol feed (99%, Sigma-Aldrich, used without further purification), the N2 gas was turned off. 1-Octanol was quantitatively supplied by an HPLC pump (NP-KX-201, NS), preheated to 300 °C, and then injected into the catalyst bed. The catalytic activity of Ba/Al2O3 and pure Al2O3 was evaluated at 300 – 400 °C and atmospheric pressure for 3 h with a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) = 7 – 56 h−1, which corresponds to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 996 – 7971 h−1. After condensation in a chiller, the products were collected separately and analyzed using a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID; Agilent 7980-B) system equipped with a 30 m HP-5 column (Agilent 19091J-413). The error of the measured catalytic activity was in the range of 4 – 5% (Fig. S2). The following parameters characterizing the catalytic activity (1-octanol conversion, 1-octene selectivity, 1-octene yield, 1-octene purity, and DOE selectivity) were calculated [7,14]: (1) 1 - o c t a n o l c o n v e r s i o n % = M o l e o f r e a c t e d 1 - o c t a n o l M o l e o f 1 - o c t a n o l i n i t i a l l y × 100 (2) 1 - o c t e n e s e l e c t i v i t y % = M o l e o f 1 - o c t a n o l r e a c t e d t o 1 - o c t e n e M o l e o f r e a c t e d 1 - o c t a n o l × 100 (3) 1 - o c t e n e y i e l d % = M o l e o f 1 - o c t a n o l r e a c t e d t o 1 - o c t e n e M o l e o f 1 - o c t a n o l i n i t i a l l y × 100 (4) 1 - o c t e n e p u r i t y % = M o l e o f 1 - o c t a n o l r e a c t e d t o 1 - o c t e n e M o l e o f 1 - o c t a n o l r e a c t e d t o o c t e n e s × 100 (5) D O E s e l e c t i v i t y % = M o l e o f 1 - o c t a n o l r e a c t e d t o d i o c t y l e t h e r M o l e o f r e a c t e d 1 - o c t a n o l × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization Table 1 shows the Ba content measured by ICP-MS, confirming that there was little loss of Ba during impregnation. The BET surface area, total pore volume, and pore size distribution of Ba/Al2O3 catalysts with various Ba contents were measured by BET-BJH analysis. In Table 1, the specific surface area and total pore volume were maintained up to 2.0 wt% Ba. However, at 2.5 and 3.0 wt% Ba, the BET surface area decreased due to the blocked pores after Ba impregnation. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and pore size distribution are illustrated in Fig. S3. The Al2O3 catalyst without Ba has the IV isotherm and H1 hysteresis loop (Fig. S3 (a)). Mesopore-containing materials present mainly IV isotherms, and the H1 hysteresis loops appear when there are relatively uniform mesopores with cylindrical pore geometry [15]. The pore size distribution in Fig. S3 (b) also shows a narrow distribution at 12.05 nm. Therefore, when 0.5–2.0 wt% Ba was impregnated into the Al2O3 catalyst, there was almost no change in the pore characteristics. When the amount of Ba was above 2.5 wt%, however, a reduced specific surface area and fewer pores sized around 12.05 nm were observed. In terms of the composition and crystal structure of Ba/Al2O3 catalysts, no significant change in the XRD peak was observed as the Ba amount increased (Fig. S4). In all catalyst samples, the main XRD peaks were assigned to γ- and δ-phase Al2O3. Meanwhile, characteristic peaks of Ba-containing compounds were not observed due to the low crystallinity of barium oxide [16]."
7,Acidic-basic properties of Ba/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.2 Acidic-basic properties of Ba/Al2O3 catalysts From the results of py.-FTIR (Fig. 1 ), the amount of Ba affects the acid site on the Al2O3 catalyst. The bands at 1621, 1614, and 1594 cm−1 are attributable to the bonds of pyridine with strong, medium, and weak Lewis acid site (LAS), respectively [17]. According to previous reports, Ba impregnated in Al2O3 preferentially bonds to penta-coordinated Al3+ ions acting as strong LAS [18,19]. When the amount of Ba increased, the strong LAS (1621 cm−1) was reduced. In addition, the intensity of the 1449 cm−1 peak, which is assignable to the bond between 19b orbital of pyridine and LAS, was decreased [20]. Finally, the peak intensity for weak LAS (1594 cm−1) increased with a Ba content at or above 1.5 wt%, in accordance with changes in the strong and medium LAS. Thus, the pyridine ion is adsorbed on weak LAS [21]. In summary, our results confirmed that the acidic properties of the Al2O3 catalyst were reduced by the addition of Ba, which is an alkaline earth metal. CO2-TPD analysis was used to characterize the surface basicity of the Ba/Al2O3 catalyst. The CO2 molecule only coordinates linearly with Ba, and is a suitable probe for the basicity of Ba since it selectively bonds with Ba between Al and Ba [22]. Fig. 2 (a) shows the result of CO2-TPD analysis of different Ba/Al2O3 catalysts. The CO2-TPD peak was observed at 150–200 °C, and its intensity and area rose with increasing Ba content. This agrees with the change in total desorbed CO2 amount calculated by integrating the TPD peaks (Table 1). In particular, when Ba ≥ 1.5 wt%, the total desorbed CO2 amount increased significantly from that of the pure Al2O3. It should be noted that the intensity of weak LAS increased rapidly, and that of strong LAS decreased at Ba ≥ 1.5 wt% according to py.-FTIR results. In addition, the basic site density is indicated in Fig. 2(b) in order to examine the correlation between the surface basicity and the specific surface area. The basic site density did not change much when Ba < 1.0 wt%, but at Ba ≥ 1.0 wt% it increased linearly with the impregnated Ba."
8,Catalytic test in 1-octanol dehydration,"3.3 Catalytic test in 1-octanol dehydration Fig. 3 shows the catalytic activity of Ba/Al2O3 catalysts with different Ba contents. At a low reaction temperature (300 °C), 1-octanol conversion was reduced with increasing Ba content. Especially when the Ba content was above 2.0 wt%, 1-octanol conversion declined greatly to less than 40%. Note that the 1-octanol conversion was inversely proportional to the basic site density (Fig. 2 (b)). In addition, the py.-FTIR result (discussed above) revealed that strong LAS was exposed on the catalyst surface with up to 1.0 wt% Ba, but was hardly observed when Ba ≥ 1.5 wt% whereas the peak intensity of weak LAS increased. Therefore, Ba impregnation affects the strong LAS that acts as the active site on the Al2O3 catalyst, resulting in reduced 1-octanol conversion [7]. However, Al2O3 catalyst with the highest 1-octanol conversion also had low purity of 1-octene (less than 80%) due to octene isomers formation by side reaction. As the reaction temperature increased, 1-octanol conversion over all the prepared catalysts was boosted. At 350 °C or higher temperatures, the catalysts with 0–1.5 wt% Ba showed similar 1-octanol conversion, while the Ba-promoted ones showed higher 1-octene selectivity and 1-octene purity than the pure Al2O3. At 400 °C, where most of the reactant was converted, the 1.5 wt% Ba/Al2O3 catalyst showed 1-octene selectivity of 63.9% and 1-octene purity of 64.1%, while those for pure Al2O3 were 34.4% and 34.5%, respectively. According to previous studies, the octene isomers are mainly generated by dehydration-hydration-dehydration after the newly produced 1-octene is re-adsorbed on the strong LAS of Al2O3 catalyst without Brønsted acid site [7,23]. However, the dehydration of 2-octanol, which is produced through hydration of olefin, showed high 1-octene selectivity over Ba-impregnated Al2O3 catalysts. The reason is that 1-alkene production through anti-Saytzeff elimination is dominant over weakly basic metal oxide catalysts. That is, as the basicity of the catalyst increases, the OH group prefers to combine with the terminal H atom than internal H atom in the hydrocarbon chain of octanol [12]. Fig. 4 plots the mole fraction of products in 1-octanol dehydration reaction versus the Ba content in the catalyst. In Fig. 4(a), the mole fraction of 1-octene and its isomers decreased with increasing Ba content at 300 °C, while that of DOE increased. At Ba ≥ 2.0 wt%, only 1-octene and DOE were formed without any isomers, thus the 1-octene purity approached 100%. When the reaction temperature was increased, the fraction of isomers increased for all catalysts while the DOE fraction decreased. Ba/Al2O3 (Ba = 0–1.5 wt%) all showed similar 1-octanol conversion at above 350 °C, as the Al2O3 catalyst rapidly enhanced the isomer fraction and reduced those of 1-octene and DOE. On the other hand, the Ba-promoted Al2O3 catalysts had higher 1-octene fraction and lower isomers fraction than Al2O3. As mentioned above, the increased amount of weak LAS after Ba addition promoted DOE production through etherification rather than isomerization by 1-octene re-adsorption. In addition, ether products are generated from alkoxide species via two different paths: direct formation at the Lewis site and reaction at the nucleophilic surface base site according to a prior paper [24]. In the latter case, it is considered to interact with the hydroxide, which is a poor leaving group, with the adjacent acid site. In other words, there are more protonated H in the OH group of alcohol after the basic site is formed on the catalyst surface by Ba impregnation. As the Ba content on the catalyst surface becomes higher, DOE production is enhanced because there are more surrounding nucleophilic alcohol molecules. Thus, the change in basic site density after Ba impregnation had a major influence on the product distribution. It is intriguing that when Ba ≥ 2.0 wt%, the 1-octene fraction was enhanced significantly with a declining DOE fraction at elevated reaction temperatures. Alcohol dehydration is controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium. As the complete dehydration to alkene and partial dehydration to ether compete with each other, the preferred reaction depends on the catalytic properties and operating conditions. Because the dehydration reaction is endothermic, complete dehydration is favored at high temperatures [25]. Thus, at a high temperature, 1-octene production via complete dehydration seems to be dominant over DOE generation through intermolecular dehydration [26,27]. According the report by Turek et al. [28], the activation energies for the dehydration to olefins are higher than those of dehydration to ether. So, the reduced DOE formation over all catalysts is at least partly due to the elevated temperature. The catalytic activity at 400 °C, which is the temperature with nearly 100% 1-octanol conversion, was examined at different LHSV (Fig. 5 ). Unlike the pure Al2O3 catalyst, Ba/Al2O3 showed reduced 1-octanol conversion as LHSV increased above 21 h−1. In the case of 2.0 wt% Ba/Al2O3 catalyst, 1-octanol conversion shrank drastically at rising of LHSV. We attribute the reduced 1-octanol conversion to the decline of the strong LAS, as confirmed by the py.-FTIR. In Fig. 5(b) and (d), 1-octene selectivity and 1-octene purity increased in a similar manner with rising LHSV. The Al2O3 catalyst with a large amount of strong LAS on the surface had the lowest 1-octene purity. It is remarkable that the Ba/Al2O3 catalysts maintained their good 1-octene selectivity and purity even when the LHSV increased to above 21 h−1. After the strong LAS was covered by Ba, the catalyst showed high 1-octene purity without producing isomers. In addition, the 1-octene selectivity for the 2.0 wt% Ba catalyst decreased as LHSV increased because of the byproduct DOE, not due to isomer formation in Fig. 5(e). In fact, the production of DOE was enhanced by Ba impregnation, since the LAS and the alkaline earth hydroxide acted simultaneously as the active sites for the self-etherification of 1-octanol. Therefore, it is important to optimize the Ba content for the production of 1-octene, the target material in this study. Over the pure Al2O3 catalyst, we observed high 1-octanol conversion at different LHSV values, but the 1-octene selectivity and yield were low due to isomer formation. When Ba, an alkaline earth metal, was impregnated into Al2O3, the 1-octene selectivity was improved and the isomer formation was suppressed. However, the 1-octene selectivity declined again due to DOE when the Ba content exceeded 2.0 wt%. Therefore, 1.5 wt% Ba/Al2O3 is the most suitable catalyst for 1-octene production through 1-octanol dehydration, by displaying the highest 1-octene purity among the tested Ba/Al2O3 catalysts without DOE production."
9,Conclusions,"Impregnating Al2O3 catalyst with Ba affected the LAS on the surface of the catalyst and consequently changed the product composition in 1-octanol dehydration. In terms of the acid site distribution, a higher Ba content preferentially reduced the strong LAS, and the content of weak LAS started to grow after the Ba content exceeded 1.5 wt%. Thus, Ba influences the performance in alcohol dehydration by affecting the composition of LAS on Al2O3 as active site. Under the condition of 400 °C and LHSV = 7 h−1, the catalysts showed similar 1-octanol conversion but different product fractions according to the Ba content. At a higher Ba content, the strong LAS was suppressed, which decreased octene isomers production through 1-octene re-adsorption and anti-Saytzeff elimination. However, 1-octene selectivity decreased at higher Ba loading (2.0 wt%), because of DOE formation through self-etherification and more protonated H in OH group of 1-octanol at a high LHSV (21 h−1). Therefore, 1.5 wt% Ba/Al2O3 catalyst was found most suitable for 1-octene production by 1-octanol dehydration."
