0,Introduction,"According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy demand almost doubled from 2011 (188 Mtoe) to 2019 (357.52 Mtoe), and 80% of the world energy consumption in 2019 was still provided by non-renewable fossil sources (coal, oil and gas) [1]. Production of chemicals and biofuels from renewable carbon resources are therefore an important topic in sustainable chemistry, and it is one of the core categories of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [2]. Lignocellulosic biomass has been considered to be one of the most promising replacement or complementary sources of fossil fuels due to its renewability, low cost and carbon neutral property [3]. Lignocellulosic biomass is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and all of these components can be converted into chemical building blocks [4], which can further be upgraded to downstream fine chemicals and biofuels [4,5]. One such chemical building block is levulinic acid (LA), which has been listed as one of the top 12 most valuable biomass-derived platform chemicals [6]. LA has shown great potential to synthesize diverse fine chemicals such as 1,4-pentanediol [7], succinic acid [8], diphenolic acid [9], as well as fuels such as alkyl levulinates [10] and methyltetrahydrofuran [11]. Conventionally, LA is synthesized from cellulose via a series of acid catalyzed reactions (hydrolysis-dehydration-rehydration) [12], this route however, would compete with the well-established bioethanol process [13]. Hemicellulose, which accounts for 20–30% of the total lignocellulose [14], is also reported to have the ability to produce LA [15,16]. As shown in Scheme 1 , hemicellulose (mainly xylan) is first hydrolyzed to furfural via dehydration by acid catalyst, and then the furfural is converted to furfuryl alcohol (FAL) by hydrogenation with metal catalyst. Finally, LA is formed from FAL via acid hydrolysis. Among them, hydrolysis of hemicellulose to furfural and hydrogenation of furfural to FAL have been extensively studied. The last step of acid hydrolysis of FAL to LA in aqueous solution is challenging since the acid-catalyzed polymerization of FAL to undesired by-products (i.e. humins) is easy to happen at the same time, leading to low yield and selectivity of LA. For instance, 100% conversion of FAL with only 32% yield of LA was achieved in water with H2SO4 (1 mol/L) [15]. Therefore, synthesis of LA directly from FAL is limited to few literatures so far. Some researchers have chosen to synthesize levulinate esters from FAL first in alcohol solvents like 1-butanol [17,18] and methanol [19]. If LA is the target product, however, extra hydrolysis of levulinate esters to LA is required such that this zigzag route to produce LA via two-step methods is energy- and time-consuming. Direct conversion of FAL to LA in high yields and selectivities would be preferable to two-step methods if methods are available. Synthesis of LA from FAL is an acid-catalyzed process and mineral acids such as H2SO4 can be used as homogeneous catalyst [15]. Homogeneous acid catalysts, however, impose issues of equipment corrosion and recycle of catalysts and spent solutions. High catalytic activity of the homogeneous mineral acid is usually accompanied by low selectivity, which increases the possibility of unwanted polymerizations of FAL to by-products [20]. Replacement of liquid mineral acids with solid acids that can avoid the above issues is one of the important research topics for sustainable lignocellulosic biomass valorization. Traditionally, acid catalytic sites (usually –SO3H) are introduced into solid supports by sulfonation with concentrated sulfuric acid [22,23] or with fuming sulfuric acid [21–23]. Although high density of SO3H sites can be obtained by these protocols, the use of strong corrosive liquid acids is dangerous and the residual waste acids require safe disposal. In this work, silica nanoflower (SiNF) was prepared in a microemulsion system by a soft template method, in which cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the template and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the source of silica were used. The SiNF was employed as the catalyst support and –SO3H groups were introduced by grafting of –SH groups via reflux, followed by oxidation of –SH to –SO3H with H2O2 at room temperature. The use of concentrated sulfuric acid and fuming sulfuric acid were avoided by the protocol introduced in this work. The obtained solid acid (SiNF–SO3H) materials were highly uniform nanospheres with diameter around 200 nm and they resembled dandelions in appearance. The solid acid SiNF–SO3H was applied to the synthesis of LA from FAL in γ-valerolactone (GVL)-H2O mixed solvent, to obtain 100% conversion and 90% LA yield, which is much higher than that reported in other studies. Properties of the solid acid catalyst were studied. The role of organic solvent additives in H2O for selective conversion of FAL to LA was investigated."

3,Synthesis of sulfonated silica catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of sulfonated silica catalyst In the typical protocol, 1.0 g CTAB, 1.0 g n-butanol, 12.0 g cyclohexane and 30.0 g urea aqueous solution (0.4 mol/L) were added into a 100 mL round-bottomed flask, and the mixtures were stirred vigorously at room temperature to form a homogeneous microemulsion. Then, 2.0 g TEOS was added dropwise to the above reaction system and stirred gently at 70 °C for 20 h. After that, the formed solid products were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. The solid was subsequently refluxed for 24 h in an ethanol solution containing 10.0 g/L NH4NO3 to remove the template CTAB. Finally, the material was washed three times with deionized water and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. The obtained silica material in this step was denoted as “SiNF”. Next, the thiol groups-containing MPTMS was grafted on the SiNF by reflux in which 100 mL toluene was loaded into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask, then 1.0 g SiNF and 1.0 g MPTMS were added and refluxed at 110 °C for 24 h while stirring. After that, the mixtures were centrifuged and the solid material was washed several times with methanol to remove the unreacted MPTMS, then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The SH-modified silica material obtained in this step was denoted as “SiNF-SH”. Finally, the SiNF-SH was oxidized by H2O2 at room temperature to convert the –SH groups to –SO3H. Typically, 1.0 g SiNF-SH was added into 35 mL H2O2 (30% concentration) and 5 mL ethanol, and then the mixtures were stirred at 300 rpm for 15 h at room temperature. After that, the mixtures were centrifuged and the solid product was washed three times with ethanol-water mixtures (v:v = 1:1), and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain SO3H-functionalized silica nanoflowers which was denoted as “SiNF–SO3H”."
4,Characterization of the samples,"2.3 Characterization of the samples Morphologies and particle sizes of the materials were observed by high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM). Texture properties and sulfur (S) content of the materials were characterized with N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and elemental analysis, respectively. Total specific surface areas were calculated with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Valence state of S in the materials was characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with mono Al Kα."
5,Catalytic reaction and product analysis,"2.4 Catalytic reaction and product analysis In a typical catalytic reaction, 0.2 mol/L of furfuryl alcohol (FAL) with 0.049 g of SiNF–SO3H catalyst were added into 5 mL GVL-H2O mixed solvent (4.5:0.5, w/w) in a 20 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave. The closed autoclave was heated to 120 °C and kept for 150 min under magnetic stirring. After reaction, the autoclave was rapidly cooled to room temperature with cold water, and the reaction mixture was centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was diluted ten times with ultrapure water and subjected to analysis with HPLC (Waters Acquity UPLC H-Class) equipped with an RI detector and a Shodex SH1011 SUGAR column. The temperature of the column and the RI detector were 50 and 35 °C, respectively. A dilute 5 mmol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was used as the mobile phase.

6,Results and discussion,
7,Preparation and characterization of the solid acid,"3.1 Preparation and characterization of the solid acid Morphology and size of the synthesized silica materials before and after –SO3H modification were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1 a and (c), SiNF particles were uniform nanospheres with diameters around 200 nm. TEM image shows that the silica nanoflowers had open-framework channels which were vertical to the spherical surface, and the radial shape appeared as a dandelion (Fig. 1c). After modification of SiNF with –SH groups by reflux at 110 °C for 24 h and oxidation with H2O2, the morphologies and sizes of the obtained SiNF–SO3H were well maintained (Fig. 1b and d), indicating high stability of the silica nanoflower as a catalyst support. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the silica nanoflowers before and after functionalization showed that both of the materials (SiNF and SiNF–SO3H) had type-IV curves with a hysteresis loop in the P/Po range of 0.7–1.0, indicating the mesoporous structure of the silica materials (Fig. 2 ). The mesopores are formed by the removal of CTAB which is widely used as a soft template for the synthesis of mesoporous materials [24,25]. The calculated textural parameters of the synthesized silica materials are summarized in Table 1 . The total specific surface area of SiNF was 645 m2 g−1 in which 97.8% comes from mesopores (637 m2 g−1). Similarly, the specific surface area of SiNF–SO3H was mainly from presence of the mesopores, but had a slight decrease in total surface area compared with the SiNF sample (605 m2 g−1 vs 645 m2 g−1). The total pore volume of SiNF–SO3H (1.4 cm3 g−1) was a little lower than that of SiNF (1.7 cm3 g−1). The decrease of total surface area and pore volume may be caused by the grafting of –SO3H-containing silane chains in the mesopores. The content of S in the silica nanoflower before and after –SO3H modification was measured by elemental analysis. The results showed that negligible S could be found in the SiNF sample, and the 5.2 wt% of S content corresponded to 1.63 mmol/g of –SO3H that was grafted onto the SiNF–SO3H sample (Table 1), which is the main Brønsted acidic center in the SiNF–SO3H catalyst. XPS analysis of SiNF-SH and SiNF–SO3H was performed to study the valence state of S in the silica nanoflowers. As shown in Fig. 3 , sulfur in the SiNF-SH sample mainly exists as –SH with a binding energy of 163.8 eV [26,27]. After oxidation by H2O2 at room temperature, the peak at 163.8 eV shifted to a higher valence state (169.0 eV) that can be attributed to –SO3H groups [28,29]. Therefore, it could be confirmed that the –SO3H groups were incorporated into the silica nanoflowers and that they are the key catalytic acidic sites for conversion of FAL to LA. The proposed mechanism for the formation of porous silica nanoflowers is illustrated in Scheme 2 . First, microemulsion system (O/W) is formed through addition of surfactant CTAB (dissolved in n-butanol) into the mixture of aqueous urea solution (water component, W) and cyclohexane (oil component, O). After that, the TEOS was added into the solutions which disperses in both the water phase and the oil phase. The TEOS goes through hydrolysis and condensation reactions with urea and then assembles on the surface of the micelles to form silicon oxide. Porous silica nanoflowers (SiNF) were obtained by removing the template CTAB with NH4NO3–CH3OH solutions [30,31]. SiNF was then modified with thiols groups (-SH) by grafting of MPTMS onto the SiNF through co-condensation [32]. Finally, SO3H-functionalized silica (SiNF–SO3H) was obtained by oxidation of SH groups with H2O2 at room temperature [26]."
8,Effect of solvent system on catalytic conversion,"3.2 Effect of solvent system on catalytic conversion Effect of solvents and solvent-mixtures including polar protic solvents (water), nonpolar aprotic solvents (1,4-Dioxane), and polar aprotic solvents (e.g. DMSO, GVL and THF) on the conversion of FAL to LA was investigated. It was found that the yield of LA increased apparently after addition of all organic solvents, whereas GVL showed the best performance, followed by dioxane, THF and DMSO (Fig. 4 a). Solvent effects are possibly due to water-organic solvent systems (e.g water-DMSO, water-GVL and water-THF, etc) that inhibit FAL polymerization (e.g. humins) through organic solvent interactions with products [33]. Moreover, the additive polar aprotic solvents (GVL and DMSO) into water which has high dipole moment and high dielectric constant (Table S1) can easily absorb energy and create hot spots that could lead to high reaction rates [34]. Among all the additive solvents, GVL is most favorable as a renewable solvent, because it is the hydrolysis-hydrogenation product of lignocellulosic biomass [35], and is regarded as a nontoxic and eco-friendly solvent [36,37]. In previous studies, the GVL has been shown to have advantages compared with petroleum-derived organic solvents (e.g toluene, hexanol, butyl alcohol) for the synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) from glucose and cellulose [38]. Hence, GVL was selected as the solvent additive to water for the synthesis of LA from FAL catalyzed by the SiNF–SO3H in this work for further study. To further understand the organic solvent effect on FAL conversion into LA, various ratios of water-GVL were studied. Initially, along with adding water from 5% to 10%, the LA increased from 38% to 78% (Fig. 4b), which can be explained by not only due to water being necessary for hydrolysis, but also due to the dipolarity/polarizability (π∗) of the mixed-solvent increasing which results in stabilization of intermediates and products [39]. However, further increase of water content (15% and 20%) led to a decrease of LA yield to 72% and 50%, respectively, under the same reaction conditions, which might be explained by the high water content resulting in an increase in hydrogen bond donor (HBD) acidity of the reaction system, which promotes the formation of humins."
9,Effect of reaction temperature and time,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature and time Effect of reaction temperature and reaction time on the catalytic performance of the SiNF–SO3H catalyst for the production of LA from FAL in GVL-water (4.5:0.5, w:w) was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5 a, reaction temperature and time have a significant effect on the catalytic conversion of FAL. When the reaction was performed at 100 °C, FAL conversion reached 82% to afford 63% LA yield. The FAL conversion and LA yield increased to 98% and 78%, respectively, as the reaction temperature increased to 120 °C. Further increase of the reaction temperature to 140 °C gave an FAL conversion (98%) that was the same as that at 120 °C, but less time was needed (90 min vs 150 min). However, the yield of LA decreased from 78% to 74% when the reaction temperature increased from 120 °C to 140 °C. The decrease in the yield can be attributed to FAL polymerization reactions that are promoted at high temperatures [40]. Fig. 5b shows that the LA yield increased gradually with an increase in reaction time until a maximum value, and decrease of LA yield was not observed with prolonging of reaction time for all reaction temperatures. The above results indicate that the product LA is relatively stable in the reaction system."
10,Effect of catalyst dosage,"3.4 Effect of catalyst dosage Effect of SiNF–SO3H catalyst dosage on the LA production from FAL was investigated. The initial FAL loading was fixed at 98 mg and the catalyst dosage was changed from 24.5 mg to 49 mg and 98 mg, corresponding to catalyst/substrate mass ratios of 0.25:1, 0.5:1 and 1:1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6 , the maximum FAL conversion and LA yield were all greatly improved as the catalyst/substrate ratio increased. When the catalyst/substrate mass ratio was 1:1 in the reaction system, the LA yield reached 88% at 120 °C for 150 min with 100% FAL conversion. These results can be attributed to an increase in the amount of Brønsted acidic centers in the reaction system with an increase in catalytic dosage, ensuring sufficient catalytic sites for the conversion of FAL to LA. In addition, adverse effects of increasing catalyst dosage that promote side reactions was not observed in this work. The above results demonstrate that the prepared SiNF–SO3H catalyst has good selectivity and high activity for LA synthesis from FAL."
11,Effect of initial FAL concentration,"3.5 Effect of initial FAL concentration The effect of initial FAL concentration on its conversion and LA yield catalyzed by the SiNF–SO3H in GVL-water (4.5:0.5, w: w) was studied. As shown in Fig. 7 , 90% yield of LA with 100% conversion of FAL could be achieved at 120 °C for 150 min when the initial FAL concentration was 0.1 mol/L. At FAL concentrations of (0.2, 0.4, 0.8) mol/L, the maximum FAL conversion varied from 95% to 100%, whereas the maximum LA yields decreased from 78% to 66%–45% for the respective FAL concentration under the same reaction conditions (120 °C, 150 min). The decline of LA yield with increase of initial FAL concentration may not be induced by insufficient acid sites of SiNF–SO3H catalyst, since the FAL conversion was up to 100% for 0.2 mol/L, 0.4 mol/L and 95% for 0.8 mol/L FAL. Therefore, the lower yield of LA at higher initial FAL concentrations are attributed to side reactions of FAL polymerization at high initial concentration, leading to the generation of humins. An et al. [20] also observed the same phenomenon and they reported that the formed soluble humins are mainly furan resins including 2,2′-difurfurylmethane, 2,2′-difurfuryl ether, and 4-hidroxy-2-cyclopenteone. The formation of water-insoluble humins could be observed from the color change of the catalyst after reuse (Figure S1)."
12,Comparison with literature results,"3.6 Comparison with literature results The yield of LA from FAL with the SiNF–SO3H obtained in this work was compared with values obtained with other catalysts reported in the literature (Table 2 ). As shown in Table 2, the LA yield of 90% obtained in this work was much higher than the other reported values. LA with 72% yield could be obtained from FAL in SBP/H2O (1:1) mixed solvent using H2SO4 catalyst, which is widely used for the acid hydrolysis of biomass to chemicals. However, separation of the LA and recovery of the homogeneous acid requires much energy and has environmental issues. Although ArSO3H–Et–HNS, a SO3H-containing organosilica solid acid, showed LA yields of 83%, the use of acetone [41] has safety and health issues. H-ZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 23 was also employed for the catalytic conversion of FAL to LA in THF/H2O (4:1), whereas the LA yield (74%) was much lower than that obtained for SiNF–SO3H and ArSO3H–Et–HNS (83.1%). Other solid acids such as Amberlyst 35, heteropolyacid-type phosphotungstic acid (PTA-Z), p-toluenesulfonic acid (TSA) catalyzed FAL into LA in moderate yields (46%–62.4%). From aspects of renewability and sustainability of solvent and catalyst, the synthesis of LA from FAL by the SiNF–SO3H in GVL/H2O developed in this work shows good prospects for practical applications."
13,Recyclability of SiNF–SO3H catalyst,"3.7 Recyclability of SiNF–SO3H catalyst To evaluate the recyclability of the SiNF–SO3H, the catalyst was reused for three times. At the end of each catalytic reaction, the solid SiNF–SO3H catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, and washed with pure water three times and then washed with pure ethanol three times. After drying at 80 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven, the catalyst was reused for the next recycle experiment under identical reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 8 , catalytic activity of SiNF–SO3H decreased after the first recovery. However, LA with 59% yield was achieved after being used for three cycles. The drop of the LA yield can be attributed to generated humins that most likely deposit on the surface of catalyst, which can be observed from the color change of the catalyst after each recovery (Figure S1). Thermogravitmetric analysis of the fresh SiNF–SO3H and the spent SiNF–SO3H catalyst (Fig. 9 ) showed that total weight loss of the spent SiNF–SO3H after reuse for three times was 42%, which was much higher than that of the fresh SiNF–SO3H (26%) and indicates that by-products such as humins had been deposited on the surface of the spent catalyst after each use, thus leading to a reduction in FAL conversion and LA yield. Preliminary trials on the catalyst regeneration was conducted with H2O2 oxidation, but it showed that –SO3H groups were removed, so that reapplication of the protocol in some form is probably necessary for catalyst regeneration."
14,Conclusion,"Silica nanoflower (SiNF) materials were prepared by a soft template in microemulsion method and were used as support to synthesize SO3H containing solid acid (SiNF–SO3H) by grafting –SH groups on the prepared SiNF, followed by oxidation of –SH to –SO3H groups under mild conditions. The SiNF–SO3H catalyst has uniform-size, dandelion-like shape and porous structure, and exhibited high catalytic activity for conversion of furfuryl alcohol to levulinic acid in a GVL-water mixed solvent system for which a levulinic acid yield of 90% was obtained at 120 °C in 150 min. This work provides a sustainable and efficient strategy to convert furfuryl alcohol to levulinic acid, which is a key step for the valorization of hemicellulose."
