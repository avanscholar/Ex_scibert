0,Introduction,"The theoretical and practical problems faced during the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the anthraquinone method have prompted continuous research interest in developing new and improving presently known catalysts for this method [1]. H2O2 is an important chemical compound widely used in textile (cotton and wood fabric bleaching), chemical (reagents), pulp and paper (wood pulp bleaching) and food (sterilised packaging of milk and fruit juice and antiparasitic treatment of salmon) industries, in wastewater treatment and in silicon wafer preparation for the manufacture of printed circuit boards [2]. The application of H2O2 in the large-scale production of propylene oxide led to the second significant expansion of the market for H2O2 consumption (2008) [2]. Among the four methods of H2O2 production (electrolysis of sulphuric acid to peroxodisulphuric acid and its hydrolysis to H2O2 and sulphuric acid; synthesis of H2O2 from hydrogen and oxygen; liquid-phase oxidation of 2-propanol with oxygen from air; sequential hydrogenation and oxidation of alkylanthraquinones), the anthraquinone method is prevalent [2,3]. The global industrial H2O2 production by this method reaches 99%. The anthraquinone method involves catalytic hydrogenation of alkylanthraquinones (2-ethyl-, 2-tert-butyl- and 2-pentylanthraquinones) to alkylanthrahydroquinones and their subsequent mild oxidation with oxygen in the air. (1) The selective catalytic hydrogenation of alkylanthraquinones to alkylanthrahydroquinones is key stage of H2O2 production by this method. However, the hydrogenation of alkylanthraquinones is a complex series–parallel reaction, in which, along with reduction of the carbonyl group in 2-ethyl-9,10-anthraquinone (eAQ), side reactions occur [4]. These include, initially, saturation of aromatic rings of 2-ethyl-9,10-anthrahydroquinone (eAQH2) to 2-ethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-9,10-anthrahydroquinone (H4eAQH2), 2-ethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9,10-anthrahydroquinone (iso-H4eAQH2), and 2-ethyl-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-9,10-anthrahydroquinone (H8eAQH2) (eAQH2 → H4eAQH2 (iso-H4eAQH2) → H8eAQH2) and the hydrogenolysis of the COH bond in eAQH2 along with anthrone formation [5]. On an industrial scale, to reduce the contribution of side processes, catalytic hydrogenation of alkylanthraquinone is not performed until its complete transformation. Alkylanthraquinone conversion does not usually exceed 60% [1]. Therefore, developing targeted approaches to synthesising highly selective hydrogenation catalysts that reduce only the carbonyl group of alkylanthraquinones without accelerating hydrogenolysis of the CO bond in alkylanthrahydroquinones or affecting the aromatic ring remains an urgent problem [1]. Overcoming this is also essential for other practically important processes: synthesis of drugs (vitamins A, B, E and K), biologically active additives (dietary supplements) and intermediates for the perfume industry, including the semihydrogenation stages of acetylene alcohols, alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) and quinones [6,7]. Most studies in this area focus on palladium catalysts. Palladium is characterised by its relatively low reactivity in the hydrogenation of aromatic rings and hydrogenolysis of the COH bond. Depending on the carrier nature and texture, the modifiers and the palladium particle size, the selectivity of the deposited palladium catalysts varies from 50% to 93%–94% [8–10]. An increase in catalyst selectivity is usually accompanied by a decrease in their activity [11]. The traditional way to regulate the catalyst properties is by controlling surface properties (acidic/basic) and the structure of the carrier pores [12], and by modification [13–16]. The addition of ammonium formate or ammonium halogenides inhibits hydrogenation of the aromatic ring of eAQH2; the introduction of small amounts of amines accelerates the oxidation of H4eAQH2; the addition of activated aluminium oxide accelerates the dehydrogenation of H4eAQH2 [1]. For the first time, we have discovered that elemental phosphorus (P4) promotes the selectivity of palladium catalysts in the hydrogenation of eAQ [17]. The H2O2 yield increased from 69% (for the palladium–carbon (Pd/C) catalyst) to 96%–98% (for the palladium–phosphorus (Pd-P) catalyst, P:Pd = 0.3). However, phosphorus modification at the reduction stage of Pd(acac)2 by hydrogen reduced the catalytic activity of Pd-P containing particles by an order of magnitude in comparison with that of Pd-black [17]. To develop active and selective hydrogenation catalysts and determine the causes of phosphorus modification effect, the nature and properties of colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles and those of Pd-P particles deposited on a carbon support were studied."
1,Experimental,
2,General procedures,"2.1 General procedures The solvents (benzene, toluene, xylene, 1-octanol and 2-octanol) were purified by standard methods [18]. Pd(acac)2 was synthesised according to the reported procedure [19]. White phosphorus was mechanically purified from surface oxidation products immediately before use and washed in anhydrous benzene. A solution of white phosphorus in benzene was prepared and stored under an inert atmosphere in a Schlenk flask. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data: δ =−522 ppm (s)."
3,General hydrogenation procedure,"2.2 General hydrogenation procedure 2.2.1 Hydrogenation of eAQ and product analysis Hydrogenation of eAQ was performed in a thermostated ‘duck’ type glass vessel at 50 °C and an initial hydrogen pressure of 2 atm in the presence of in situ formed palladium catalysts. A solution of Pd(acac)2 (0.0152 g, 5 × 10−5 mol) in a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbon/octanol (ratio 7:10) solvents was reduced by hydrogen at 90 °C at 2 atm in the presence of white phosphorus at different P:Pd ratios (P:Pd = 0, 0.3, 0.7 and 1.0) for 30–45 min until the quantitative transformation of Pd(acac)2. The resulting black-brown suspension or ‘solution’ was cooled to 50 °C under hydrogen pressure of 2 atm; subsequently, 3 ml of eAQ solution in toluene (2.116 mmol, 0.4993 g) was injected using a syringe. Hydrogenation was performed with intensive mixing, excluding the reaction in the diffusion region. After absorption of 1.0, 1.2 or 1.4 mol H2⋅(eAQ mol)−1, samples were collected for analysis. To this end, an aliquot (5 mL) of the reaction mixture was filtered from the catalyst in an argon atmosphere. The aliquot of filtrate (5 mL) was taken and oxidised with oxygen in the air for 15–20 min. Subsequently, 30 ml of water was added and H2O2 was extracted from the organic layer (5 mL) into water (30 mL) by stirring. The amount of H2O2 extracted was determined by titrating an aliquot (10 mL) of the pre-acidified water layer with KMnO4 (0.1 N). The KMnO4 concentration was controlled using a primary standard of oxalic acid or ammonium oxalate. Hydrogenation of eAQ is performed in two stages: during the first stage, at a high speed, hydrogenation of eAQ to eAQH2 is predominant, while during the second stage, products of the conversion of eAQH2 are formed: H4eAQH2, H8eAQH2 and 2-ethyl-9(10)-anthrones at lower speed. Insignificant amounts of transformation products of eAQH2 are formed during the first stage of hydrogenation. Therefore, the reaction rate r (molH2 min−1) at each stage was determined from the kinetic curve (the dependence of the amount of hydrogen absorbed on the reaction time). The rate of hydrogenation of eAQ to eAQH2 (r1 ) was calculated based on the tangent of the angle of inclination of the straight sections of the kinetic curves in the absorption interval 0.1–0.5 eq. of hydrogen. The rate of conversion of eAQH2 (r2 ) was calculated using the slope ratio of straight-line sections of the kinetic curves in the interval of absorption 1.1–1.2 eq. of hydrogen. Since Pd-P catalysts are not individual substances, the catalytic activity (A) was used to compare their properties in eAQ hydrogenation. The activity of Pd-P catalysts in the first and second sections of the kinetic curve was calculated as the ratio of the reaction rate (r1 or r2 ) to the initial concentration of Pd(acac)2. The compositions of the transformation products of eAQ were analysed by GLC on a chromatograph (Chromatec-Crystal 5000.2; capillary column length: 30 m; phase: poly(5% diphenyl / 95% dimethylpolysiloxane)–(BPX-5); flame ionisation detector) under the following temperature programming conditions: 160 °C (3 min), 270 °C (20 min) and heating rate of 40 °C min−1. In parallel, intermediates and reaction products were identified using a GCMS-QP2010 Ultra Shimadzu gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (capillary column GsBP⋅5MS, length: 30 m, phase: poly(5% diphenyl / 95% dimethyl polysilphenylenesiloxane)). 2.2.2 Catalyst recycling The stability of the Pd-P/C catalyst in eAQ hydrogenation was studied in a 170 ml batch thermostated glass reactor (internal diameter 40 mm) at 50 °C, 2 bar hydrogen pressure and vigorous stirring using a magnetic stirrer (1000 rpm). The Pd-P/C catalyst (0.603 g, 2.87 × 10−5 mol Pd) was loaded into the reactor in an argon flow, purged with hydrogen for 15 min, then 32 ml of 1-octanol and 32 ml of eAQ toluene solution (2 g, 8.474 mmol eAQ) were added. The reactor was sealed and a hydrogen pressure of 2 bar was created. After uptake of 1.2 mol H2 (mol Pd)−1, the hydrogenation of eAQ was stopped. A clear emerald-colored solution was carefully decanted into a Schlenk flask in argon, and an aliquot of the solution (10 ml) was used to determine the yield of hydrogen peroxide. The catalyst in the reactor was washed with a mixture of toluene/1-octanol, dried in vacuum (50 °C/2 Torr) and tested in the hydrogenation of the next portion of eAQ without adding fresh catalyst. After five cycles of eAQ hydrogenation, the catalyst was washed twice with a mixture of toluene/1-octanol, then with toluene and dried in vacuum (50 °C/2 Torr). Data from ICP analysis after hydrogenation: Pd – 0.54 wt. %, P – 0.057 wt. %. 2.2.3 Preparation of the catalysts Preparation of the Pd-P catalyst for the TEM. The Pd-P catalyst for the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study was prepared in situ as done when studying its properties in the hydrogenation of eAQ. A 1 ml of phosphorus solution in benzene (1.5 × 10–5 mol relative to atomic phosphorus) was added dropwise to a solution of Pd(acac)2 (0.0152 g, 5 × 10–5 mol) in 7 ml of toluene, placed in a thermostated reaction vessel under hydrogen flow and then stirred at room temperature for 5 min. Subsequently, 1-octanol (10 mL) was added, the temperature was increased to 90 °C and the catalyst was formed with intensive stirring of the reaction mixture in hydrogen for 30–45 min until quantitative transformation of Pd(acac)2 occurred. The transformation of Pd(acac)2 was controlled by UV spectroscopy based on the absorption band at 330 nm (ε330 = 10,630 L⋅ cm−1⋅ mol−1). The resulting black-brown colloidal solution was cooled to 30 °C. A drop of Pd-P catalyst solution was applied to a carbonised copper grid (200 mesh) and dried at room temperature in a box under an inert atmosphere. Preparation of the Pd-P catalyst for the XPS and XRD. Preparation of Pd-P catalyst sample for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) studies: To a solution of Pd(acac)2 (0.4566 g, 1.55 × 10−3 mol) in 68 ml of toluene in a thermostated reaction vessel under hydrogen, 3.1 ml of phosphorus solution (4.5 × 10−4 mol, calculated relative to atomic phosphorus) in benzene was added dropwise and stirred for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 1-octanol (44.5 mL) was added, the temperature was increased to 90 °C and the catalyst was formed by intensive stirring of the reaction mixture in hydrogen for 30–45 min until quantitative transformation of Pd(acac)2 occurred. When the reaction was complete, the resulting catalytic system was cooled to room temperature and transferred in an inert atmosphere to a Schlenk flask. The solvents were then distilled under vacuum (2/3 of the volume), and diethyl ether was added to form a black precipitate. This was washed sequentially with benzene and diethyl ether in an argon atmosphere and dried under vacuum (50 °C/1 torr). The yield was 0.1090 g. Data from ICP analysis: Pd–90.32 wt. %, P – 8.27 wt. %. Preparation of the Pd-P/C catalyst. Preparation of Pd-P/C catalyst sample for XPS and XRD studies: Toluene (10 mL) and 1-octanol (10 mL) were added to a mixture of Pd(acac)2 (0.0152 g, 5.0 × 10−5 mol) and coal (0.2607 g, Sibunit type, fraction 0.2–0.4 mm, S = 450 m2 g−1) in a thermostated reaction vessel, in a hydrogen flow. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 60 min. Subsequently, 0.37 ml of phosphorus (1.5 × 10−5 mol, calculated relative to atomic phosphorus) solution in benzene under hydrogen was added dropwise to the reaction vessel and stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The temperature was then increased to 90 °C, and the catalyst was formed by intensive stirring of the reaction mixture in hydrogen for 45 min until quantitative transformation of Pd(acac)2 occurred. When the reaction was complete, the resulting catalytic system was cooled to room temperature and transferred in an inert atmosphere to a Schlenk flask. The liquid above the sediment was decanted, and the precipitate was sequentially washed with benzene and diethyl ether in an argon atmosphere and dried under vacuum (50 °C/1 torr). The yield was 0.2420 g. Data from ICP analysis: Pd – 0.46 wt. %, P – 0.66 wt. %."
4,Characterization techniques,"2.3 Characterization techniques UV spectra were recorded on an SF-2000 spectrophotometer (Russia) in quartz cuvettes having an absorbing layer thickness of 0.1 cm. The conversion of Pd(acac)2 was controlled using the absorption band at 330 nm (ε330 = 10,630 L⋅ cm−1⋅ mol−1). Additionally, the products of the interaction of Pd(acac)2 with elemental phosphorus were analysed on a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GCMS-QP2010 Ultra Shimadzu, capillary column GsBP⋅5MS, length: 30 m, phase: poly(5% dephenyl/95% dimethyl polysilphenylenesiloxane). Ionisation was initiated by electron impact, with an ionisation energy of 70 eV. The obtained mass spectra were compared with the reported data (comparison libraries, Wiley, NIST, NIST05). The Pd-P catalyst was analysed by XRD using a XRD-7000 S diffractometer (Shimadzu Co., Japan) (CuKα radiation, Ni filter, λ =1.5418 Å). TEM images were obtained using an electron microscope (Tecnai G2, FEI, USA) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The images were recorded using a CCD camera (Soft Imaging System, Germany). Local elemental analysis was performed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Phoenix) using a Si (Li) detector. The particle structure parameters in the images parameters were measured using iTEM 5.0 and DigitalMicrographs 1.94.1613 software. The analysis of structure periodicity and image filtration were analysed using Fourier methods, i.e. fast Fourier transformation and inverse fast Fourier transformation. The average size was determined by processing an area containing at least 100 particles. X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained using a photoelectron spectrometer SPECS (SPECS, Germany) equipped with a PHOIBOS 150 MCD 9 energy analyser, using monochromatised AlKα radiation (1,486.74 eV). A survey spectrum was recorded with a step of 1 eV at an analyser transmission energy of 20 eV, and high-resolution spectra (narrow scans) in steps of 0.1 eV and a transmission energy of 10 eV. The C1s carbon line (285.0 eV) was recorded for spectrum calibration. Non-uniform charging was compensated by flood the sample with low-energy electrons. The samples were etched for 2 min by Ar+ ions using a PU-IQE112/38 scanning ion gun (‘SPECS’) at an accelerating voltage of 2.5 kV and an ion current of 20 μA, which provided an etching rate of ∼1 nm min−1. The experimental data were processed using the CasaXPS program. The spin–orbit splitting of doublet lines Pd 3d 5/2–3/2 and P 2p 3/2–1/ 2 was approximated by two Lorentz–Gaussian curves with doublet separations of 5.26 and 0.84 eV, respectively, at an area ratio of 3/2 for Pd 3d 5/2–3/2 and 2/1 for P 2p 3/2–1/2. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of spectral lines was determined according to the reported data for similar substances and conditions for obtaining spectra ≤1.5 eV (up to 1.2 eV for phosphorus). It was presumed that if the FWHM exceeds 1.5 eV (1.2 eV for phosphorus), these lines should be approximated by several curves corresponding to different chemical forms of the element. Since the oxygen 1s spectral line heavily overlaps with the 3p 3/2 palladium line, the number of chemical forms of palladium and their line positions were coordinated with the second doublet line Pd 3p 1/2 in the survey spectrum. ICP analysis. The catalysts samples were decomposed in acidic solutions under heating in accordance with the procedure described in [20]. The solutions were analyzed on the Agilent 7500ce unit manufactured by Agilent Technologies with quadrupol mass analyzer (Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Measurements were performed under the following optimal conditions: plasma power 1550 W, reflected power 1 W, the carrying gas flow rate 0.8 L/min, auxiliary gas flow 0.13 L min−1, integration time 0.1 s, points on mass – 3, oxides (CeO/Ce, 156/140) = 0.3%. The device was tuned by Tuning solution with the concentration of 10 μg L−1 (10 ppb) Li, Co, Y, Ce, Tl. The calculation of elements concentrations was carried out by external calibration method using multi-element certified solutions 68A-A, 68A-C (High-purity Standards) containing all of the elements from Li to U. The calibration solutions were diluted with 2% HNO3 down to the concentration 50–200 μg L−1 (50, 100 and 200 ppb) of each element. The drift tracking of the device was carried out by internal standard In (10 ppb). Calculation of the concentrations was based on the most abundant isotopes, giving signals, free of overlapping or subject to minimum isobar and polyatomic disturbances. Elements detection limits are at the level of 1 ppt (Pd) and 50 ppb (P), determination errors are 5 and 20%, accordingly."
5,Results and discussion,"As noted above, modification of palladium hydrogenation catalysts with elemental phosphorus increases the H2O2 yield obtained by the anthraquinone method from 69% to 96%–98% [17]. However, colloidal solutions of Pd-P catalyst are almost an order of magnitude less active in eAQ hydrogenation than Pd black formed during reduction of Pd(acac)2 by hydrogen in the absence of white phosphorus. To optimise the conditions of eAQ hydrogenation catalysed by colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles, various reaction parameters were varied. The nature of the aromatic hydrocarbon (benzene, toluene and xylene) used as a solvent and higher alcohols (1-octanol and 2-octanol) did not affect the H2O2 yield (Table 1 ). As the temperature increased from 30 °C to 80 °C, the release of H2O2 in the presence of Pd-P catalyst (P:Pd = 0.3) decreased from 97% to 86% (Table 1). An active and selective catalyst for eAQ hydrogenation was obtained by Pd-P catalyst formation in the presence of a carbon support. The catalytic properties of Pd-P/C catalyst are presented in Table 2 . The activity of the Pd-P/C catalyst (P:Pd = 0.3) in eAQ hydrogenation increases fivefold on average in comparison with colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles (Table 2). The initial activity of the Pd-P/C catalysts (P:Pd = 0.3) depended on the palladium content on the carbon carrier. As the palladium content on the carbon varied from 2 to 0.5 wt. %, the activity of the Pd-P/C catalysts (P:Pd = 0.3) doubled (from 4 min−1 for the 2 wt. % Pd-P/C catalyst to 7–11 min−1 for the 0.25–0.5 wt. % Pd-P/C catalyst) without reducing the H2O2 yield (Table 2). The Pd-P/C catalyst (0.25–0.5 wt. %) formed in hydrogen is comparable in activity with the 2 wt. % Pd/C catalyst and is almost comparable in activity with heterogeneous catalysts described in the literature (for Pd/Al2O3, Pd/SiO2 and Pd/C, A = 12–16 min−1 at T =62 °C and P H2 = 1 atm [21]). Hydrogenation of eAQ in the presence of a 0.5 or 1 wt. % Pd-P/C catalyst (P:Pd = 0.3) ensures a H2O2 yield reaching 93%–94% (Table 2). To establish the stability of the Pd-P/C catalyst, five portions of the substrate were sequentially hydrogenated in a batch reactor. The experiments were carried out at 50 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 2 bar, without adding fresh catalyst to the reaction system. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the Pd-P/C catalyst is relatively stable after five eAQ hydrogenation cycles: the yield of hydrogen peroxide has remained almost constant. To determine the causes of the modification effect of phosphorus on the activity and selectivity of palladium catalysts in eAQ hydrogenation, their physical characteristics were studied. Based on TEM, colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles and Pd-P/C catalysts containing different palladium mass contents have differ catalyst particle size. In the Pd(acac)2-0.3P-H2 system, high-contrast particles with an average diameter of 34.4 ± 13.7 nm were formed (Fig. 2 a). The mean coherent domain size (CDS) of the Pd-P catalyst particles does not exceed 1.5 nm (Fig. 2b). The structural disorder of the Pd-P catalyst particles (P:Pd = 0.3) is verified by the electron diffraction data (Fig. 2a, inset) and XRD (Fig. 2c, inset). Diffuse Debye rings are observed in the electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 2a, inset), as well as significant broadening of diffraction maxima in the XRD curve (Fig. 2c). The CDS calculated using the Selyakov–Scherrer formula is 1.6 nm. The broadening of the diffraction peak may be due to both the small size of the CDS and crystal lattice defects. A large half-width of the diffraction peak at 71° (d/n =1.3241 Å) in the diffraction curve of the Pd-P catalyst in comparison with the half-width of the peak at 39.59° (d/n =2.2765 Å) indicates distortion of the palladium crystal structure. For palladium crystallites, d/n =2.2458 Å (111) and 1.37537 (220) Å (# 00-046-1043). Similar results were obtained for the Pd-P catalyst formed in the Pd(acac)2-nP-H2 system at the ratio P:Pd = 1.0 (solvent: toluene/1-octanol). Pd-P catalyst particles (P:Pd = 1.0) having a diameter of 25–70 nm are composed of smaller particles having a diameter of 7–10 nm (Fig. 3 a). The average particle diameter is 36.4 ± 21.6 nm. On the diffraction curve of the Pd-P catalyst (P:Pd = 1.0), two broadened maxima with d/n =2.2533 Å and 1.3547 Å, are observed; the half-width of the peak at 69° (d/n =1.3547 Å) also predominates over the half-width of the peak at 40.01° (d/n =2.2533 Å). The CSD calculated by the Selyakov–Scherrer formula is 1.8 nm (Fig. 3с, inset). Crystallinity disturbance in the palladium catalyst formed in the presence of white phosphorus is due to incorporation of phosphorus (metalloid) into the particles. EDX analysis of selected areas of a Pd-P catalyst sample (P:Pd = 0.3) indicate that it has a homogeneous composition; the P:Pd ratio for different sections is 0.23:1 (Fig. 2c). For the Pd-P catalyst (P:Pd = 1.0), the P:Pd ratio for different sections varies from 0.32:1 to 0.2:1 (Fig. 3c). Thus, the common features of Pd-P catalyst particles formed in toluene/1-octanol solution at different P:Pd ratios are the incorporation of elemental phosphorus, distortion of the palladium crystal structure and the formation of structurally disordered Pd-P solid solutions. As the P:Pd ratio increases, the size of the base particles decreases and the degree of polydispersity of the Pd-P catalyst increases due to diffuse aggregation of the catalyst particles (Figs. 2 and 3). For the Pd-P/C catalyst (0.5 wt. %, P:Pd = 0.3), the average particle size is 3.6 ± 0.9 nm (Fig. S1, SI2). For the Pd-P/C catalyst (2.0 wt. %, P:Pd = 0.3), the average particle size (6.5 ± 1.3 nm) is five times smaller than that of colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles (34.4 ± 13.7 nm) (Figs. 2a, 4a ). Particle size comparison confirms that the main reason for the increased activity of the Pd-P/C catalyst in eAQ hydrogenation in comparison with colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles is the increased dispersion. Based on the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) data, Pd-P/C catalyst particles are also structurally disordered. The CDS of the Pd-P catalyst particles does not exceed 0.6–1.6 nm (Fig. 4b). Due to the low palladium content in the Pd-P/C catalyst (0.5 wt. %; P:Pd = 0.3) and structural disorder of particles, XRD proved to be uninformative (Fig. S2, SI2). The diffraction curve of the 0.5 wt. % Pd-P/C catalyst (P:Pd = 0.3) showed only the reflexes of the carbon support (d/n = 3.5447, 2.0907, 1.7217 and 1.2137 Å) with relative intensities (I/I0 ) 100, 13, 2 and 2, respectively. To determine the state of the surface layer, the 0.5 wt. % Pd-P/C catalyst sample (P:Pd = 0.3) was studied by XPS. The surface composition of the Pd-P/C catalyst is represented by four elements: Pd, P, C and O (Fig. 5 ). The ratios of the contents of the chemical forms of elements are given in Table 3 . The X-ray photoelectron spectrum of Pd 3d is represented by three spin-orbit doublets, 3d 5/2–3/2, characterising the three chemical states of palladium (Fig. 5a). The binding energy of the photoelectrons of the high-intensity component Pd 3d 5/2, with a maximum of 335.6 eV, is close to that of palladium in the reduced state, Pd(0) [22]. The binding energy of Pd 3d 5/2, 338.0 eV, is characteristic of Pd2+ in Pd(acac)2 [23,24]. The Pd(acac)2 precursor content, among three chemical forms of palladium, does not exceed 15%. The high-intensity component with the binding energy Eb(Pd 3d 5/2) =336.0 eV corresponds to an electron-deficient form of palladium (Pdδ+) in palladium phosphides, solid palladium solutions with phosphorus (Eb(Pd 3d5/2 ) =336.2 eV) [25,26] and small palladium clusters on the carbon support (Eb(Pd 3d5/2 ) =336.1 eV) [27]. The P 2p X-ray spectrum contains a peak with a binding energy of 130.5 eV (Fig. 5c). The position of the P 2р3/2 level at 130.5 eV is characteristic of the phosphorus state in metal phosphides (Eb(P 2р3/2 ) = 128.5–130 eV) [28], elemental phosphorus (Eb(P 2р3/2 ) = 129.9–130.4 eV) [29,30] and phosphorus in metal alloys (Eb(P 2р3/2 ) = 130.1 eV). Considering the electron microscopy data (Fig. 2b, c) and P 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 5c), the Pd 3d 5/2 binding energy of 336.0 eV is related to palladium in structurally disordered solid solutions. The molecular formula of the surface compound (Pd19P) does not match the composition of any known phosphides (Pd15P2, Pd6P, Pd4.8P, Pd3P, Pd5P2 or PdP2 [31]). The composition of the surface compound (Pd19P) also indicates the formation of a solid solution between palladium and phosphorus during Pd-P/C catalyst formation by the low-temperature method due to phosphorus incorporation in the palladium crystal structure. The electron-deficient palladium form (Pdδ+) prevails in the surface layer of the Pd-P/C catalyst. The surface concentration of the Pdδ+ form (indicated as PdxP in Table 3) exceeds the Pd(0) concentration by 3.25 times (Table 3). Surface enrichment by the electron-deficient form of palladium is also characteristic of Pd-P catalyst particles obtained without a carbon support (Table 4 ). It should be noted that after Pd-P/C catalyst argon etching (2 min), the same four elements (Pd, P, C and O) again represent the surface layer composition. The ratios of the elemental concentrations (at. %) coincide (Table 5 ); however, in the near-surface layer, there is no Pd(0) (Table 5). The composition of the PdxP compound in the near-surface layer (Pd23.5P) is close to that of the solid solution in the surface layer. In the surface layer of the Pd-P/C catalyst, phosphorus is predominantly present in the oxidised state in the form of pentavalent tetracoordinated phosphorus: PO4 3− (Eb(P 2р3/2 ) = 135.0 eV) and R–O–PO3 2− (Eb(P 2р3/2 ) = 133.6 eV) [32] (Fig. 5c, Table 3). The presence of the oxidised phosphorus form (PO4 3−) is primarily associated with the oxidation of surface phosphides of transition metals or Pd-P solid solutions with oxygen at the sample preparation stage [33]. According to literature, phosphorus in alkyl phosphate attributes to one of the high-intensity components of phosphorus (Eb(P 2р3/2 ) = 133.6 eV). The presence of octyl phosphate on the surface of the Pd-P/C catalyst cannot be unambiguously confirmed based only on the XPS data (P 2p3/2 , C 1s, O 1s) for several reasons, including the low surface concentration of phosphorus and overlapping of the photoelectron spectra of the R–O–P fragments with that of the carbon support. Particularly, the XPS C 1s spectrum is decomposed into six components (Fig. 6 a) and the XPS O 1s spectrum is decomposed into five components (Fig. 6c). The components of the C 1s line correlate with graphite carbon (Eb(C 1s) = 284.7 eV), aliphatic carbon (Eb(C 1s) = 284.9 eV), carbon in alcohols, esters or COP fragments (Eb(C 1s) = 285.8 eV), carbon in carbonyl groups (Eb(C 1s) = 285.8 eV) and carbon in carboxyl or complex ester groups (Eb(C 1s) = 289.1 eV) [34] (Table 3, Fig. 6a). The carbon binding energy of the COP fragment coincides with that in alcohols and common ethers. The oxygen binding energy of the O 1s level of the OP bond (Eb(O 1s) = 533.3 eV) coincides with that in ethers (Table 3, Fig. 6c) [34]. Therefore, the formation of octyl esters of phosphoric acid in the reaction system Pd(acac)2-P in toluene/1-octanol medium was confirmed by additional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The presence of phosphorus on the Pd-P/C catalyst surface in the reduced and oxidised states is due to the following chemical reactions at the catalyst formation stage. Phosphorus introduced into the system as a modifier does not only react with palladium(0) atoms produced during the reaction (2) to form solid solutions of PdxP under mild conditions. (2) Pd ( acac ) 2 + H 2 → Pd + 2 Hacac (3) xPd + P → Pd x P With respect to Pd(acac)2, both phosphorus and hydrogen act as reducing agents [35] ( E H 3 P O 3 / P o = -0.502 V; E P d 2 + / P d o o = +0.99 V): (4) 3 Pd ( acac ) 2 + 2 P + 6 H 2 O → 3 Pd + 6 Hacac + 2 H 3 P O 3 Phosphorous acid formed and its salts also possess reducing properties with respect to Pd(acac)2 [36] ( E H 3 P O 3 / H 3 P O 4 o = −0.276 V; E P d 2 + / P d o o = +0.99 V). (5) Pd ( acac ) 2 + H 3 P O 3 + H 2 O → Pd + 2 Hacac + H 3 P O 4 Due to the neutralisation of phosphoric acids with 1-octanol (solvent), phosphoric acid octyl esters are formed. All the results of the kinetic experiments and physical and chemical analysis data for Pd-P catalyst particles and Pd-P/C catalyst allow us to determine the main causes of the effect of modification of phosphorus on activity and selectivity in eAQ hydrogenation. The formation of palladium catalysts in hydrogen in the presence of elemental phosphorus under mild conditions leads to the incorporation of phosphorus into palladium particles, the formation of structurally disordered solid solutions and the appearance of a partial positive charge on palladium. The hydrogenation reaction requires activation of molecular hydrogen and alkylanthraquinone. Pd catalysts having high electron density on palladium are more active in anthraquinone hydrogenation [37,38]. The appearance of a partial positive charge on palladium in Pd-P catalyst particles weakens the activation of molecular hydrogen and the HH bond break required for catalytic hydrogenation [39,40]. Thus, the predominance of electron-deficient palladium on the surface leads to the low activity of colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles during the hydrogenation reaction. Increased dispersion of the Pd-P/C catalyst (d = 6.1 ± 1.5 nm; P:Pd = 0.3) in comparison with colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles (d = 34.4 ± 13.7 nm) (Figs. 2a, 3 a) and the Pd/C catalyst (d = 14.1 ± 6.1 nm (TEM); 13.5 nm (CDS)) (Fig. S3, SI2) leads to an increase in its activity in eAQ hydrogenation and partially compensates for the negative effect of phosphorus on catalytic activity. Colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles and Pd-P/C catalyst are characterised by their high selectivity for active quinones. At least three factors define the promoting effect of phosphorus on selectivity. First, the incorporation of phosphorus into palladium catalyst particles reduces the concentration of so called ‘non-selective’ hydrogen in the near-surface layer [41] favourable for side processes. The solubility of hydrogen in palladium phosphides or solid solutions of palladium with phosphorus is lower than that in palladium crystallites [42]. The solubility of hydrogen is inversely correlated with the phosphorus content. Second, palladium solid solutions with phosphorus contain more strongly bound hydrogen [43], which is disadvantageous for hydrogenation of the aromatic ring [44]. Third, the formation of structurally disordered solutions is less favourable for adsorption of alkylanthraquinones by the plane of the aromatic ring for its subsequent hydrogenation [45]. Based on DFT calculations [45], palladium crystallites facetted by the (111) planes are most favourable for saturation of alkylanthraquinone aromatic rings."
6,Conclusion,"The properties of colloidal solutions of Pd-P particles and Pd-P/C catalysts in the hydrogenation of eAQ in toluene/1-octanol medium were studied. The results of catalytic experiments showed that phosphorus modification increases the selectivity to active quinones from 69% to 93%–97%. The deposition of Pd-P particles on the carbon support increases their activity fivefold with no drop in selectivity for the target product as a result of its increased dispersion. With its high selectivity, the 0.5 wt. % Pd-P/C catalyst activity is comparable with those of the heterogeneous catalysts described in the literature: Pd/Al2O3, Pd/SiO2 and Pd/C. Using EDX analysis, XRD, HRTEM and XPS, the composition, size and state of the surface layers of Pd-P catalysts were determined. During Pd-P catalyst particle formation by the low-temperature method in toluene/1-octanol medium, structurally disordered solid solutions are formed due to phosphorus incorporation into the palladium crystal structure. The surface of Pd-P catalyst particles is enriched with electron-deficient palladium. Surface enrichment by the electron-deficient palladium and structural disorder of Pd-P catalyst particles are responsible for the increase in selectivity for active quinones in H2O2 production by the anthraquinone method."
