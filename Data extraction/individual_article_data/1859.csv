0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has a variety of important uses in the chemical industry [1,2]. If it could be produced inexpensively on large scales it might be useful as a clean-burning high energy density fuel [3]. Today, hydrogen is primarily produced by reforming non-renewable fossil hydrocarbon feedstocks. Present production of hydrogen by reforming of natural gas will be difficult to compete with on a cost of production basis alone during the coming decades due to the expectation of low natural gas prices. Eventually, low cost fossil resources will be depleted and alternative means of efficiently producing hydrogen are desirable. Electrochemical production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water is not generally cost effective for fuel production due to the combined capital and operating expenses of electrolysis. Electrolysis of water requires a relatively high overpotential beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium cell voltage (∼1.23 V) largely due to the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution. Although electrolysis of water is relatively simple, efficient, and can make use of often-intermittent renewable electrical energy sources, to produce very high purity H2 the overall economics have not been shown to be economical for large scale production [4]. Alkaline water electrolysis in concentrated KOH is technologically mature with demonstrated conversion efficiencies of 64–70% (LHV) [5]. Although the fixed capital cost of the electrolyzer and power electronics is high, it is the variable cost of electricity that dominates the production costs for large scale facilities [6]. The total cost of the electrolytic process, Ct, can be expressed as a function of total cell voltage as (1): (1) Ct = ΔVtotiAetb+ a′Aet, where ΔVtot corresponds to the cell voltage, i - applied current density, Ae - the electrode area, t - electrolysis time, b - cost of the electrical energy and a′ - the ratio between the electrode price and its service life [7]. Due to the cost, today less than 5% of the hydrogen gas produced worldwide is generated using electrolysis of water [8]. From Eq. (1) can be seen that process variable costs can be significantly reduced and the overall economics improved if the power consumption per kg of hydrogen produced is reduced. Utilizing a feedstock which requires a lower oxidation potential that might be obtained at a lower cost than increasingly precious water could significantly reduce the variable cost of hydrogen production by electrolysis. Wastewater containing oxidizable organic species is one candidate feedstock. In general, wastewater has a negative economic value and there are costs associated with treatment or safe disposal that often involve oxidation of the organic components in traditional management. In certain instances, with difficult to treat wastewaters, the added benefit of cleaning up the wastewater stream would significantly impact the final economics of a hydrogen producing process that made use of the waste stream [9]. The chemical composition of wastewater is variable and generally extremely complex with a variety of biologically and industrially produced molecules. Organic species in wastewater include alcohols, glycerol, other polyols, carbohydrates, organic acids, aldehydes and ketones many of which have very low standard oxidation potentials (∼0.3 V). There have been many proposed uses of electrochemical, photochemical, and photoelectrochemical processes to oxidize these species [10–28] including several for the production of hydrogen [20–22,25,27]. Electrooxidation of organics with co-production of hydrogen has, in general, focused on low molecular weight compounds, such as methanol or formic acid, from aqueous organic solutions at relatively low voltages [29–32]. For more complex wastewaters two mechanisms of electrochemical oxidation have been identified [33]. The first is an indirect oxidation through the generation of strongly oxidizing species (e.g. Cl−, S2O8 2−, and Ce4+) on the anode which subsequently oxidizes the organics. The second is the direct anodic oxidation of organics at the anode often through the generation of physically adsorbed “active oxygen” or “chemisorbed oxygen”. The specific anode material used also depends on the organic compound itself and the interaction mechanisms between the organic and the anode. For example, oxalic acid is oxidized with increasing difficulty on electrode materials having high oxygen affinity [34] while glucose oxidation occurs at more negative potential on gold electrode surface than on any other, such as Pt, Ni, Cu and Fe [35]. The most extensively studied anodic materials are Pt, PbO2, IrO2, SnO2, and conductive diamond films [33]. Pt and Ir are expensive metals, while PbO2 is subjected to electrochemical corrosion and releases Pb2+. Undoped SnO2 is not conductive enough for use as an electrode. Our interest is in evaluating conditions for oxidation of typical wastewater constituents using at most 1 V. We want to identify readily oxidizable organic model compounds that are representative of those present in waste streams at reasonable concentrations, a suitable anode electrocatalytic material, and the composition, pH, and temperature for the supporting electrolyte to achieve high Faradaic efficiency low-voltage electrolysis. In this paper we address the following questions: 1) What are the relative low voltage electroxidation activities of Au, Pt, and stainless steel electrodes for series of organic compounds representative of wastewater? 2) How does the electrolyte pH affect the electrooxidation activity? 3) What is the dependence of electrocatalytic activity on temperature? 4) For the highest activity electrodes and optimal conditions, what is the Faradaic and hydrogen energy production efficiency?"
1,Experimental methods,
2,Electrolyte preparation,"2.1 Electrolyte preparation Electrolytes were prepared from deionized water and sodium sulfate (EMD Chemicals, 99% purity) as the supporting electrolyte with 100 mM concentrations of model organic molecules with functional groups characteristic of those found in typical wastewater. The model compounds investigated were methanol (BDH Reagents and Chemicals, 99.8% purity), ethanol (Gold Shield Chemical), glycerol (EMD Chemicals, 99.5% purity), isopropanol (Fischer Scientific, 99.5% purity), propanal (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥97%), d-(+)-Glucose (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5% purity), sucrose (EMD Chemicals), citric acid (Alfa Aesar, 99.5% purity), propionic acid (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5% purity) and EDTA (Disodium salt Fischer Biotech, 99% purity)."
3,Electrodes,"2.2 Electrodes Platinum wire (0.37 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode (WE) for cyclic voltammetry (CV) and a platinum wire, a gold rod (2.08 mm diameter) or a 308 stainless steel (SS) rod (2.40 mm diameter) were used as WEs in the chronoamperometry (CA) tests. Platinum mesh was used as a counter electrode (CE) in both CV and CA tests. A silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) cell was used as reference electrodes (RefE) as indicated. Platinum wire and platinum mesh were electrochemically cleaned in HNO3 (8.75 wt%) before each experiment. Before each measurement, gold was activated and stabilized in 0.25 M H2SO4 by CV scans at 100 mV/s between −0.4 and 1.2 V until stable voltammograms were observed. The SS rod was cleaned using EZ-Flex Metalite Cloth sheets (grit: 500-J). The working surface areas of the electrodes were 1.6 cm2 (gold rod), 0.28 cm2 (Pt wire), 1.8 cm2 (stainless steel rod)."
4,Electrochemical analysis,"2.3 Electrochemical analysis A BioLogic VSP potentiostat was used with EC-Lab software for the electrochemical analysis. Cyclic voltammetry was performed in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution containing 0.1 M organic species at pH 2, 7 and 12 using sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH (Accumet Excel XL50 dual channel pH/ion/conductivity meter). Each CV test was done using a three electrode system in a slowly stirred beaker containing 60 mL of electrolyte. Chronoamperometry was performed in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution containing 1 M organic species at pH 2, 7 and 12. A two electrode split-cell system (no reference electrode) was used with the two compartments separated by a glass frit and each compartment stirred. The WE and CE were placed in different compartments. The CE compartment was purged with argon starting 5 min before each CA test and continued through the experiment."
5,Efficiency measurements,"2.4 Efficiency measurements The Faradaic efficiency was determined by capturing the hydrogen produced at the cathode and measuring the hydrogen evolved in the sealed, argon pre-purged, split cell as a function of total charge supplied between the anode and cathode. The hydrogen was measured using a Hewlett–Packard 5890 Series II Gas Chromatograph calibrated using H2 gas from a Praxair Grade 5.0 hydrogen tank. The hydrogen production efficiency was calculated as the heat of combustion of the hydrogen produced divided by the electrical energy applied."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Electrooxidation of model compounds,"3.1 Electrooxidation of model compounds The voltage and peak currents for electrooxidation on a Pt working electrode were determined from cyclic voltammograms obtained from 0.1 M solutions of the individual organic species with 1 M Na2SO4 as a supporting electrolyte. Each CV data set was processed manually and oxidation peaks were identified. The results from all the model compounds at pH values of 2, 7 and 12, are shown in Fig. 1 (a–c), respectively. For several organic species multiple oxidation peaks were observed due to the multiple oxidation steps involved in oxidizing the organic compound. The results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that several species have relatively high oxidation currents at relatively low voltages: glycerol, propionic acid, propanal, ethanol and methanol at (pH 2), citric acid, methanol and propanal (pH 7) and glucose, glycerol and methanol (pH 12). The moieties involved in the low voltage oxidation were hydroxylic, acidic, and aldehydic functional groups, with alcohol group oxidation observed to be facile over a large range of pH values from acidic to basic. These alcohol groups will be prevalent in the carbohydrates of domestic wastewater which typically contains ∼50% proteins, 40% carbohydrates and 10% fats and oils [36]. In many industrial wastewater streams significantly greater concentrations of these groups are present such as those from the biodiesel industry which generates an aqueous glycerol and methanol mixture as a byproduct [37]. Our observations are consistent with a recent report showing that, for the alcohols tested using a Pt anode in alkaline conditions; glycerol and methanol had the highest electrooxidation current densities [38]. For all alcohols we investigated, the largest peak oxidation currents were observed between 0.8 and 1.0 V vs RHE, in agreement with the literature values summarized in Table 1 . A strong dependence on the electrolyte pH was observed for the electrooxidation rate. The electrode surface changes with pH and it is expected that this surface change will impact the kinetics. It was reported that the applied potential for glucose oxidation decreases with increasing pH [39]. This trend is also observed for all the hydroxylic group containing compounds shown in Fig. 1 with highest currents produced at 0.8–1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 2 and -0.3 to 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 12. These voltages are in agreement with alcohol photoelectrooxidation mechanisms compiled and reviewed by Lianos [28] where in basic medium reactive hydroxyl radicals would preferentially form to facilitate alcohol oxidation. Organic wastewater compounds were further investigated as potential electron donors via electrooxidation with simultaneous molecular hydrogen co-production using chronoamperometry at 1 V in 1 M Na2SO4 to establish the most effective electrode material. 1 V was selected as sufficient to oxidize wide variety of organic compounds while being lower than ∼1.23–1.5 V needed for water oxidation thus decreasing the total cost of the process. Platinum, stainless steel and gold electrodes were evaluated as anodes using a Pt mesh cathode and the data are displayed in Fig. 2 . Note that although the reference electrode in Fig. 2 is independent of pH, the counter electrode reaction when applying 1 V in a two-electrode system (H2 evolution) is dependent on pH. The highest initial currents generated were for propionic acid on stainless steel and ethanol on Pt electrodes at pH 2, methanol on Pt and citric acid on stainless steel at pH 7 and glucose on both Au and Pt and pH 12. The highest geometric current density and therefore highest rate of oxidation and (based on the assumption of a moderate Faradaic efficiency) hydrogen production was for the oxidation of glucose using a gold electrode at pH 12. The possible reasons for the decrease in current with time observed in Fig. 2 are (i) the electrode poisoning with intermediates from the oxidation, (ii) depletion of organic compounds near the electrodes due to not enough mass transfer and (iii) the double layer capacitance build-up indicative of a capacitor charging response. Higher current densities in 1 M Na2SO4 and 1 M glucose using a gold electrode were obtained at pH 12 compared to pH of 2 or 7, which is in agreement with the data reported by Vassilyev et al. [40]. The current density obtained at pH 12 for glucose oxidation was lower on Pt than in Au, most likely due to surface site blocking effects. Pt has a high energy of hydrogen adsorption relative to Au; hence, dehydrogenation of an organic compound followed by Pt–C bond formation [41] results in site blocking that prevents further organic oxidation [42], whereas the Au does not have this surface poisoning issue. Pt is also much more prone towards CO adsorption and poisoning, than Au [43], The intrinsic affinity of Au towards hydroxyl group formation coupled with the resistance to surface adsorbates blocking active sites makes Au a more effective electrocatalyst at pH 12 than Pt for glucose oxidation. Studies reported that saturated, but not unsaturated alcohols remain inactive in the absence of the adsorbed hydroxyl groups in acidic solutions at the Au/solution interface [44] which explains why in this work methanol and ethanol oxidation did not proceed rapidly on Au at pH 2. The stainless steel anode showed appreciable currents with propionic acid at pH 2 and citric acid at pH 7. However, based on previous reports which show that the stainless steel (W.Nr.1.4301) anode for maleic acid electrooxidation at an applied 1 V potential with respect to Au and Pt at pH of 2.9 and 7.1, respectively, was unstable with respect to dissolution of Cr and Ni [45], we can conclude that the current density observed for organic acids on stainless steel at pH 2 and 7 is most likely the convolution of currents due to both organic electrooxidation and electrode dissolution (corrosion). Thus stainless steel is not suitable for practical use at 1 V except under alkaline conditions. However, due to the low current densities seen even under alkaline conditions it is not a practical anode material. Slight discrepancies between the CA experiments in Fig. 2 and the CV data shown in Fig. 1 for the compounds that gave the highest oxidation currents were due to adsorbed intermediates on the electrodes which were able to build up during the CA experiments, and thus reduced the currents in the CA experiments relative to the transient CV measurements. Depending on the specific intermediate species and its adsorption energy, rate of formation, coverage, the rate (current) of electrooxidation at constant voltage may be limited by the accumulation of these adsorbed species. Most of these parameters will be affected by the temperature with a general trend of enhanced kinetics at elevated temperatures. Thus, in an attempt to understand the effect of temperature on the anode, the CA tests were repeated at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 75 °C (vide infra)."
8,Glucose oxidation on a gold anode: concentration and temperature effects,"3.2 Glucose oxidation on a gold anode: concentration and temperature effects Fig. 3 shows typical CV behavior observed from 0.1 M glucose in a 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution on a gold electrode at a pH of 2 and 12 using a scan rate 100 mV/s. Also shown are data from control experiments with no glucose present and at a lower (0.01 M) glucose concentration which was performed to allow a direct comparison with tests reported previously by other groups [40]. At pH 2, the anodic peak at 1.1 V (with glucose Fig. 3a) with reduction peak at 0.75 V in the cathodic sweep may be attributed to oxidation/reduction of the gold electrode surface itself [46]. Vassilyev et al. showed that glucose oxidation on gold electrodes in phosphate buffer solutions can proceed in very acidic pH values only on the oxidized surface of the gold electrode [40]; others [47,48] have suggested that the catalytic mechanism for glucose on gold oxide proceeds with a surface oxygen atom which induces glucose dehydroxylation followed by a rapid electrochemical regeneration of the surface oxide. It is possible that the current peak from glucose at pH 2 observed at 1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl is glucose oxidation that only can begin when a gold oxide film is formed which serves as the active site for electrooxidation of glucose. Although gold dissolution is possible at low pH [39], the relatively large charge associated with the reduction currents observed during the cathodic sweep are not consistent with Au dissolution in the stirred solution. The relatively large glucose oxidation peak at 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 12 (Fig. 3b) is in agreement with the literature data showing that glucose oxidation occurs at a more negative potential on Au than on Pt, Ni, Cu or Fe [35], and that glucose is easily oxidized under alkaline conditions [40,48,49]. Our observations of glucose electrooxidation on Au at pH 12 shown in Fig. 3b were compared to those reported in the literature. A large volume of work has been performed in the past to investigate transformation mechanisms of glucose on gold electrode surface due to the importance of glucose sensing in biological medium [50–52] as well as glucose oxygen fuel cells [53]; here, we will present our experimental results as well as revisit some fundamental aspects with respect to maximizing current by optimizing experimental electrooxidation parameters such as glucose concentration, pH, and temperature. Peaks identified at 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.5 V vs. SHE) during the positive sweep agree with previously reported values of approximately 0.5 V vs. SHE at identical sweep rates and sweep potentials [40]. The difference in the glucose oxidation peak positions and the general curve shape between 0.1 and 0.01 M solutions can be explained by the adsorbed intermediates formed at the surface. In the 0.01 M case, the voltage was swept down to −1 V whereas in the 0.1 M case the voltage was swept down to −0.5 V, yielding different reduced species on the electrode and slightly altering the position of the primary oxidation peak in the positive sweep. The electrooxidation of glucose in alkaline media is thought to proceed through partial dissociation of glucose and subsequent formation into the endiol form [40,54] (2) R–CH(OH)–COH + OH− → R–C(OH)=CO(−)H + H2O which then adsorbs on the surface metal sites forming Me–C bonds with the dehydrogenated carbon moiety, by analogy with ethylene glycol electrooxidation on Pt at alkaline pH [41]: (3) Au + R–C(OH)=CO(−)H → R–(Au)C(OH)–CO(−)H Hydroxyl ions, OH−, are required to neutralize the free protons generated during the dehydrogenation step; otherwise, the rate of dehydrogenation would decrease [49] thus explaining the low rate of oxidation of glucose in acidic solutions. The dehydrogenated molecule can then be transformed into gluconate via hydrogen elimination or dehydrogenate to gluconolactone [39]. Both gluconic acid and gluconolactone were reported as the final products of glucose oxidation in alkaline solutions on gold electrodes [40]. Second order effects, such as water and hydroxyl radical adsorption via (4) Au + OH− → Au-OHads + e− (5) Au + H2O → Au-OHads + H+ + e− would contribute to enhanced glucose oxidation currents [40]. Furthermore, adsorbed hydroxyl sites formed can interact with glucose molecules catalytically [49]. The remarkable reactivity of gold has been explained using the incipient hydrous oxide/adatom mediator (IHOAM) model of electrocatalysis [55] with high energy metastable metal surface (MMS) active site atoms (<1% of total surface sites) formed by energizing the surface using cathodic, abrasive or thermal pretreatment [56]. The defect sites formed contain partially filled d-orbitals which can stabilize free radical intermediates thus promoting reactions [56]. At acidic pH values, however, the loss of active sites can occur via selective dissolution, where only low energy sites (EMS, equilibrated metal surface sites) remain intact and result in an effective decrease in electrode surface area by smoothing and severe loss of electrocatalytic activity [57,58]. The current density dependence of 1 M glucose oxidation on the pH of the solution was further investigated at various alkaline pHs (pH 10–13.5). CA curves obtained are shown in Fig. 4 at an applied, two electrode voltage of 1 V. The initial current density (first 250 s) increases with increasing pH while the current at longer times increases linearly up to pH 13 and then decreases at pH 13.5, as shown in Fig. 4. The linear increase in the current with increasing pH can be related to the enhanced oxidation of glucose at high pH values facilitated by hydroxyl radical formation, as discussed previously [28]. Hydroxyl anions are efficient hole scavengers that can react to form hydroxyl radicals followed by the oxidation of glucose: (6) 6OH− + 6h+ → 6OH• (7) Glucose + 6OH• → xCO2 + yH2O At pH 13.5, however, the steady state current did not correlate with the linear increase with pH observed between lower pH values. A potential explanation may be that the glucose solution completely changed color at pH 13.5 to a dark brown with white particles precipitating out of solution (not shown) which is consistent with solution phase base catalyzed glucose reactions occurring in the bulk solution and not electrode chemistry, per se. It is generally known that glucose in solution can take on five different structures with more complexity introduced in alkaline pH values due to the possible formation of d-mannose and d-fructose [59]. Also, in alkaline medium glucose hydrolysis phenomena are likely, leading to the breaking of C–C bonds thus yielding short chain molecules. This change in the structure of glucose may be the reason for the different CA of pH 13.5 compared to the lower pH values. CA experiments were performed of 1 M glucose oxidation in 1 M Na2SO4 solution at pH 12 at room temperature, 35 °C, and 50 °C. These data are shown in Fig. 5 a. The glucose solution color was yellow at 35 °C changing to black at 50 °C suggesting thermal reactions in the bulk perhaps involving hydroxyl groups at pH 12. Yei et al. [59] performed glucose electrocatalytic oxidation experiments up to 40 °C due to the similar glucose degradation at higher temperatures. While the exact products of glucose degradation at temperatures higher than 40 °C in alkaline solution are not precisely known, they do not necessarily inhibit the electrooxidation current measured as shown in Fig. 5a after 1800 s. Because heating the sample requires external energy thus increasing operating costs, and the steady state current at 30–40 °C is quite similar to that obtained when the solution is heated to higher temperatures, we propose that an operating temperature of 30–40 °C is ideal for glucose electrochemical oxidation on a gold electrode in alkaline pH values. The effect of the glucose concentration on the current obtained was investigated and shown in Fig. 5b. Two regimes can be observed from the CA curves shown in Fig. 5b. Initially (first 400 s), larger currents are generated at lower concentration (0.1–0.5 M), rather than higher concentration (1–2 M) glucose solutions. In all cases, a transient current is observed which gradually decays to the steady state for concentrations higher than 0.1 M or close to zero for 0.1 M. Since the first step of the glucose oxidation on a gold electrode is its deprotonation, it is also possible that at 0.1 M (or lower) all of the deprotonation occurred by ∼1800 s yielding negligible current. High concentration (1–2 M) glucose samples have low initial currents possibly because the oxidation of glucose requires both hydroxyl sites and adsorbed glucose sites. With high local concentrations of glucose, there may be high coverage of adsorbed glucose without enough free sites to adsorb hydroxyls, or if the sites are saturated (56% [60]) there may be steric blocking from the adsorbed glucose oxidation products minimizing the ability of reactants to get to the surface, and thus minimizing the current. As the glucose is consumed near the electrode, this issue may become minimized, possibly why similar steady state current is observed after ∼1800 s for all concentrations, except 0.1 M, where the concentration of glucose may not be sufficient for maximum oxidation currents. To verify the production of hydrogen when applying the external voltage, the Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen production was estimated and found to be approximately 70% for a charge of 10 Coulombs (1 V applied for 140 min) while the hydrogen energy efficiency was determined to be 86%. Faradaic efficiencies for the production of hydrogen from organics have been measured for biocatalyzed cells where the efficiency for oxidation of acetate and formation hydrogen was found to be 53% [61] and for a microbial cell where the hydrogen yield was approximately 20%, mostly due to losses by diffusion [62]. Crossover of hydrogen and side reactions can be prevented using a membrane, and values of approximately 74% [63] or even 100% [64] have been found for the Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen production in microbial electrolysis cells and 100% for hydrogen production from methanol in a PEM electrolyzer [30]. For the methanol fuel cell, the efficiency of energy supplied to energy in the form of hydrogen ranged from approximately 100–120%, depending on the overpotential required at various current densities [30]. Finally, when compared to the water splitting using oxygen evolution as oxidation reaction, the most efficient experimental conditions observed here (3 mA/cm2 current density obtained for glucose oxidation on gold electrode at pH 12 at 1 V) would equate to ∼25% lower energy consumption assuming equal Faradaic efficiencies (1 V for organics oxidation vs. 1.35 V for water oxidation with 0.095 V overpotential for OER and 0.024 V for HER as extrapolated from the experimental data reported by Weber and Dignam [65])."
9,Summary and conclusions,"The electrooxidation of selected organic compounds was investigated to determine optimal process conditions for low voltage (∼1 V) electrooxidation. Under acidic conditions (pH 2) on a platinum electrode, ethanol oxidation gave the highest currents of the organics tested. At pH 7, citric acid had the highest electrooxidation activity followed by methanol and then ethanol. Under alkaline (pH 12) conditions, glucose was a superb reductant followed in reactivity by glycerol and methanol. These results imply that alcohol hydroxylic or organic acid group moieties commonly found in organic wastewater streams are suitable for low voltage electrooxidation. Gold proved to be the most active electrocatalyst for electrooxidation of 0.5 M glucose at pH of 13. While water is a relatively cheap resource, expensive concentrated hydroxide [66] is required to perform alkaline water electrolysis. Here we show that relatively low pH 12 is required for alkaline glucose electrolysis while more than 3 mA/cm2 current density can be obtained via electrooxidation of glucose under 1 V applied voltage at steady state conditions. Lower pH values resulted in lower currents for the electrooxidation of glucose. For the electrooxidation of glucose on a gold electrode the current increases as a function of temperature; however, at higher temperatures, non-electrochemical reactions proceed which inhibit sustained current production, resulting in a maximum steady-state current at 40 °C. The Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen production achieved was approximately 70% for glucose on the Au electrode."
