0,Introduction,"Fossil fuel is the main source of energy globally, and its overexploitation to fulfill ever-increasing demands will lead to its depletion and cause a serious threat to energy security and environments. According to a report, Middle Eastern countries' major exporters of oil and natural gas, will not be able to supply and meet energy demands by the next 50 years (Shields-Menard et al., 2018). Another concern is environmental pollution, as fossil fuel burning produces greenhouse gases (CO2, SO2, and NOx) and toxic pollutants (polycyclic hydrocarbons, mercury, and volatile chemicals) responsible for global warming and have multiple adverse effects on human health (Perera, 2017). Keeping in view all the challenges, there is a need to find alternative sources of energy that are ecofriendly, sustainable, and renewable and have the potential to fulfill future energy demands. Various renewable energy resources such as wind energy, solar energy, and hydro energy are in trends to fulfill the increasing energy demands. Benefits associated with these energy resources include low greenhouse gas emissions, reducing dependence on imported fuels, and contributing to economy improvement by providing job opportunities in manufacturing and installation (Karaca and Dincer, 2020). Although these technologies are mature enough to satisfy energy demands but these technologies have their own limitations. The main drawback related to these technologies is the geographical location as solar, wind and hydro energy are sporadic in nature, therefore, limits the people of such region from the use of these renewable sources of energy. Other barriers include a lack of policies and regulations favoring the development and adaption of these technologies (Kariuki, 2018). According to a report, renewable energy has the potential to reduce energy-related CO2 emissions by 90% (Darwish and Al-Dabbagh, 2020). Researchers are also making continuous efforts to explore other renewable sources of energy, such as biodiesel, bioelectricity, biohydrogen, and biohythane (Wong et al., 2020; Xin and Qiu, 2021). Biodiesel can be prepared using the esterification/transesterification reaction of oils (e.g., vegetable oils, waste cooking, and others) with alcohols using various catalysts (Godri Pollitt et al., 2019). Cultivation of energy crops also helps to improve soil quality with reduced need of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides and led to an increase in food yield and production which will strengthen food security. Due to food security issues, biodiesel production is not possible at a large scale. Biohydrogen is another source of renewable energy and can be produced using various technologies such as photolysis, thermochemical reactions (pyrolysis and gasification) of biomass, photo fermentation, and the dark fermentation process (Dauptain et al., 2020; Ergal et al., 2018). Although the conversion rate of thermochemical technology is higher but these processes are less specific and require high temperature input compared to other technologies (Parakh et al., 2020). Biological methods of hydrogen production require long reaction time and result in lower productivity (4 mol of H2 per mol of glucose), but this method is more selective towards the hydrogen production and these methods are environmentally friendly and less energy intensive. Among biobased hydrogen production methods (dark fermentation and photo fermentation) dark fermentation has gained significant attention due to high yield, limited reaction time and ability to utilize a wide range of waste organic material as raw material (Srivastava et al., 2019). In dark fermentation, anaerobic microbes (Enterobacter sp., Clostridium sp. and Bacillus sp.) produce hydrogen by utilizing organic waste and water. Amount of biohydrogen produced depends on the type of strain and affected by low disintegration rate of substrate and its consumption by methanogens and acetogens (Yang et al., 2020). Although pure culture results in higher hydrogen yield but utilization of mixed culture offers choice of broad substrate and easy to control (Mahata et al., 2020). Most of the hydrogen production processes are based on the utilization of pure sugars (glucose, xylose, sucrose, etc.) which make the process costly (Moradian et al., 2020; Tunçay et al., 2017). Lignocellulosic biomass is a cheap raw material present in an ample amount (Hazeena et al., 2020). It can be utilized to produce high energy-density ecofriendly biohydrogen using the dark fermentation process. The main disadvantage associated with biomass is its recalcitrant nature due to its complex structure and presence of lignin, which hinders the access of enzymes to hydrolyzable sugars (Millati et al., 2020). Biomass requires pretreatment before it can be subjected to fermentation (Abraham et al., 2020). Various pretreatment methods, both traditional (e.g., acids, alkali) and advanced (e.g., ionic liquid, supercritical), have been reported to decrease biomass recalcitrance (Haldar and Purkait, 2021). Dark fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass results in biohydrogen and other side products (e.g., acetate, butyrate, lactate, ethanol, CH4), which depends on microbes and operating conditions (Sikora et al., 2017). The pyruvate produced from glycolysis enters into the acidogenic pathway coupled with H2 production under anaerobic conditions. This results in the formation of volatile fatty acids and methane (Chandrasekhar et al., 2015). H2 yield is varied depending on fermentation products as shown in the following Eqs. (1)–(6). (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 acetic acid pathway (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O propionic acid pathway (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 butyric acid pathway (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → COOH CH 2 CH 2 OCOOH + 2 CO 2 mallic acid pathway (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 OH + CO 2 ethanol pathway (6) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 4 + 4 CO 2 + + 4 H 2 methane pathway Different strategies have been explored to make the dark fermentation process more effective and increase biohydrogen productivity and yield, such as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), and cell-free enzyme-based synthesis (Ren et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2013). Biohydrogen production is affected by the type of raw materials, available nutrients (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphate, sulfates), and other operational conditions, such as pH and T (Shahbaz et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2018). Researchers are introducing new techniques, such as the utilization of mixed substrates (to complement each other), mixed microbial culture, and use of nanomaterials and carbon-based biomaterials to support the microbial growth and improvement of the activity of enzymes involved in H2 production (Lopez-Hidalgo et al., 2018; Morales-Martínez et al., 2020; Srivastava et al., 2019). The objective of this article is to present the recent advances in pretreatment technologies with cost analysis comparisons, the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biohydrogen using different methods, effects of various operating conditions and factors, and recent strategies used to increase biohydrogen production such as co-substrate, coculture, the addition of supportive material and coproduction of other bioenergy products to improve the overall process economically."
1,Lignocellulosic biomass composition and pretreatment methods,
2,Composition of lignocellulosic biomass,"2.1 Composition of lignocellulosic biomass Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three main constituents of lignocellulosic biomass (Fig. 1 ). Cellulose, the most abundant polymer, is composed of d-glucose units, while hemicellulose is made up of d-xylose, l-arabinose, d-mannose, d-galactose, acetyl groups, and uronic acids (Vu et al., 2020). The lignin polymer is composed of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) subunits, and their ratio varies with the plant species. Different monomeric components are interlinked through (β-O-4) aryl ether bonds. In angiosperms, guaiacyl and syringyl are the major components, followed by p-hydroxyphenyl, while gymnosperm lignin is mainly composed of guaiacyl with small contents of p-hydroxyphenyl (Liu et al., 2019). The lignin components of biomass confine the enzyme availability to cellulose and hemicellulose. The influence of H-lignin on biomass recalcitrance is relatively less explored. Recent studies discovered that high H-lignin contained plants showed reduced biomass recalcitrance and exhibited increased sugar yields (Hirayama et al., 2019). The positive effect of H-lignin is due to reduced lignin molecular weight, decreased cellulose crystallinity via H unit-glucan bonding, and increased linkage activities between H monomer than G and S units in lignin. The alkaline extractability of lignin in transgenic Alfalfa containing 50–76% H had increased. The yield of hexose sugars was increased with H level in alkali pretreated Miscanthus. In addition, Arabidopsis mutant H-rich (89%) exhibited significantly higher sugar yield than G-rich (96%) and S-rich (92%) mutants without the pretreatment (Li et al., 2016). In the past decades, H2 production using various lignocellulosic materials, such as wheat straw, rice husk, rice straw, grass, softwoods, and woody raw materials, has been explored. The physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic biomass are vital parameters to consider prior to any thermochemical or biochemical processing method. These properties influence the supply chain network for biomass handling, transport, and process conversion performance. These properties include particle size, grind ability, density, flowability, moisture sorption, and thermal properties (Cai et al., 2017). The shape and size of lignocellulosic biomass particles affect the mass transfer and the mixing and flow behavior of particles. Cellulose and lignin are very fibrous and difficult to grind. The particle density and bulk density are two main characteristics of biomass. The mass of all particles divided by the volume that the particles occupy excluding or including the pore space volume in the particle density and bulk density, respectively. Flowability property measures the biomass flow from one point to another point. Moisture sorption of biomass is essential for biomass harvesting, handling, transport, and storage. Drying and storage processes are essential to preserve the quality of lignocellulosic biomass. Thermal conductivity and specific heat are two thermal properties that influence biomass thermochemical conversion (Cai et al., 2017). The fractionation process converts the lignocellulosic biomass into three fractions cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The cellulose fraction is used as a fiber or as a substrate to produce value-added fuels and chemicals. The lignin fraction has the potential as a substrate to produce specialty chemicals. The hemicellulose fraction is used to produce multiple products and industrial chemicals. The complex and recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic biomass is the main bottleneck to producing fermentable sugars for H2 production. Various pretreatment methods have been explored to maximize sugar release from lignocellulosic biomass."
3,Traditional pretreatment methods,"2.2 Traditional pretreatment methods Physical, chemical, physicochemical, and biological pretreatment methods have been used to remove the lignin content and increase the availability of pentose and hexose sugars (Amin et al., 2017; Baruah et al., 2018). Physical pretreatment methods include milling (to reduce the particle size), atmospheric and high-pressure microwave treatment, extrusion, and ultrasonication (Table 1 ). Chemical methods, such as alkaline and acid hydrolysis and organosolvent processes have been also explored by various research groups for biomass pretreatment. Alkaline hydrolysis pretreatment uses sodium hydroxide, calcium, potassium, and ammonium. These alkaline processes alter the lignin structure by degrading ester and glycosidic side chains of the biomass that leads to swelling as well as decrystallization of cellulose. In addition, they remove acetyl and various uronic acid substitutions on the hemicelluloses that restrict enzyme accessibility (Loow et al., 2016). Acid hydrolysis pretreatment uses both organic and inorganic acids, such as formic acid, maleic acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and phosphoric acid, respectively (Baruah et al., 2018). Multiple studies have shown that dilute acid hydrolysis caused swelling of biomass, formation of porous and distorted fibrils, forming an exposed zones or hollow areas with pores, and subsequently relaxing the structural linkages between xylan and lignin (Loow et al., 2016). The crystallinity index of the biomass solids was increased after the pretreatment process, demonstrating the exposure of the cellulose portion due to the elimination of amorphous material such as lignin and xylan. The internal surface area increased after the acid pretreatment is easily accessible to enzymes to produce more fermentable sugars. Steam explosion and ammonia fiber explosion are physicochemical pretreatment methods that use high-pressure steam at high temperature and liquid ammonia at high temperature and pressure, respectively. Hydrothermal pretreatment uses water at high temperature and pressure. The biological pretreatment methods are based on whole cell and enzymatic pretreatment. Lignocellulose-degrading bacteria or fungi secrete lignin peroxidase, laccases, cellobiose dehydrogenase, and manganese peroxidase to remove the lignin (Jönsson and Martín, 2016). Lignin degrading enzymes are divided into lignin degrading auxiliary (LDA) enzymes and lignin modifying enzymes (LME) (Janusz et al., 2017). LDA enzymes such as cellobiose dehydrogenase are unable to degrade lignin alone and required additional enzymes to complete the degradation process. Cellobiose dehydrogenase is identified as the first non-hydrolytic enzyme secreted by white rot fungi involved in the breakdown of cellulose. It can oxidize cellobiose, β-1,4-linked disaccharides, and oligosaccharides to their corresponding lactones using electron acceptors. LME or ligninolytic enzymes are categorized into laccase and heme-containing peroxidases. Laccase is a copper containing enzyme act on phenolic and non-phenolic compounds and plays a crucial role in the depolymerization of lignin and its derivatives for delignification. Lignin peroxidase is heme-containing enzyme that degrades phenolic compounds, lignin, and its derivatives via an oxidation process. Manganese peroxidase belongs to oxidoreductase family that catalyze oxidation of lignin and its derivative compounds, non-phenolic compounds in the presence of H2O2 as an oxidant. The drawbacks of most of the traditional methods are low sugar yield, higher processing cost, low selectivity, and the release of inhibitory products. Most of the pretreatment methods involving agricultural residues, hardwood, or softwood result in the production of phenolic and aromatic compounds. The concentration and type of the phenolic compounds produced is based on the substrate loading and biomass type (Basak et al., 2020). The pretreatment usually results in the production of guaiacyl and syringyl moieties from lignin residue. Polyphenolic compounds such as hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and rosmarinic acid), gallic acid, and tannins are released during biomass pretreatment. Pentose and hexose sugars present in the biomass form aliphatic acids and furan aldehydes. Also, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a hexose sugar degradation product that is found in the hemicellulose part of biomass (Fig. 1). HMF is further converted to formic and levulinic acid (Fig. 1). Similarly, xylose and arabinose degrade to form furfural and furfural further degrades to formic acid. Acetic acid, vanillic acid, benzoic acid, syringic acid are weak acids that have been found in pretreated hydrolysates. The ideal pretreatment methods are eco-friendly, low cost, and highly selective and release less inhibitory products."
4,Advanced pretreatment methods,"2.3 Advanced pretreatment methods The advanced pretreatment methods of biomass are ILs, supercritical fluid (SCFs)-based pretreatment, cosolvent enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation (CELF), and low temperature steep delignification (LTSD). 2.3.1 ILs and SCF-based pretreatment ILs are eco-friendly solvents with low toxicity and high thermal strength. ILs selectively eliminate the hemicellulose and lignin content of lignocellulosic biomass and release cellulose (Brandt et al., 2011). The complete or partial solubilization of lignocellulosic biomass has been achieved using acidic ILs. The four different strategies have been widely used to separate the dissolved and undissolved fractions upon complete (homogeneous) or partial (heterogonous) dissolution of the wood. The first strategy is mostly used when there is no need for biomass fractionation. The lignocellulosic biomass is partially or completely dissolved, and the reaction mixture is then fully regenerated using an anti-solvent without any fractionation. It is widely used for processing biomass into composites. In the second strategy, lignocellulosic biomass is dissolved completely and fractioned to lignin and polysaccharides factions by selective regeneration. The third strategy separates the dissolved biomass from undissolved using filtration or centrifugation prior to regeneration. In the fourth strategy, biomass is fractioned into three parts including, undissolved biomass, polysaccharide-rich fraction, and lignin (Abushammala and Mao, 2020). ILs are developed to dissolve the lignin and partial hemicellulose. Imidazolium-based ILs removed 15–92% of lignin from miscanthus, willow, pine, and switchgrass after pretreatment (Sun et al., 2017). ILs and enzymatic hydrolysis pretreatment released 90% of glucose content and 25% of hemicellulose from lignocellulosic biomass. The yield of reducing sugar was lower by the traditional acid and alkali pretreatment methods used for rice straw, barley straw, and wheat bran for the conversion, as compared to that by ILs method. The nature of ILs is basic, acidic, and near neutral in case of [Ch][Lys], [TEA][HSO4], and [C2C1Im] [OAc], respectively. ILs such as cholinium lysinate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, and triethylammonium hydrogen sulfate have been developed for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (Gschwend et al., 2018). Different ILs have been used to remove 15–92% of lignin from miscanthus treated for 2–22 h at 120 °C. In addition, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride treatment removed 17.4, 17.2, 65, 27, and 35% of lignin from willow, pine, switchgrass, maple wood, and oak, respectively. ILs tolerant enzymes have been developed for saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass in the consolidated process to decrease the process cost. The cost, recovery, and reuse of ILs are major considerations for the industrial applications of biomass pretreatment. The cost of raw material for ILs synthesis using biomass-derived material is 13.71$/kg; however, modification of the reductive amination step could reduce the raw material cost by up to 4$/kg as suggested by techno-economic analysis (Socha et al., 2014). SCFs have distinctive characteristics such as gas and liquid states and lower solvation power with tunable solvent properties. The lower critical temperature and pressure of CO2 make it a good solvent for the easy separation of monomers and non-polar materials from polymers and polar compounds, respectively. CO2 effortlessly enters through the biomass surface to decrease the resistance and increase cellulose penetrability (Relvas et al., 2015). Enzymes access cellulose and hemicellulose to produce maximum sugars. The high-pressure CO2/H2O process is combined with enzymatic hydrolysis of pine dust to achieve maximum reducing sugar production. Rice straw was pretreated using supercritical CO2 at 160 °C and 15 bar for 50 min, and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis produced 79% of the reducing sugar yield (Cha et al., 2014). Moreover, application of supercritical CO2 at 170 °C and 50 bar for 60 min, and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of switchgrass, mixed perennial grasses, mixed hardwood, and big bluestem produced reducing sugars at rates of 14, 15.7, 9, and 22.1%, respectively (Gao et al., 2010; Luterbacher et al., 2010; Relvas et al., 2015; Zhang and Wu, 2015). The applications of CO2 are not explored well in the direct hydrolysis of untreated lignocellulosic biomass, one-pot pretreatment and fermentation, and consortium solvents with CO2 for pretreatment. 2.3.2 LTSD and CELF LTSD is an efficient pretreatment method for lignocellulosic biomass conversion as it uses a low concentration of non-toxic chemicals, bases, and oxygen. It eliminates and retrieves 90% of the lignin from lignocellulosic biomass, including agricultural residues, softwood, and hardwood (Park et al., 2015). The LTSD process fractionates the biomass into lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose and allows the integration of enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, and distillation steps. The effect of LTSD was investigated for the conversion of hardwood chips using hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, and sodium chlorite, resulting in the whole conversion of the xylan part. After enzymatic hydrolysis, a 78% yield of glucan was obtained (Park et al., 2015). CELF uses a combination of organic solvent, water, tetrahydrofuran, and mild sulfuric acid to dissolve acetylated lignin from lignocellulosic biomass and stimulates cellulose hydrolysis in water to achieve the maximum reducing sugar yield at a low enzyme dose (Meng et al., 2018). CELF uses organic solvents, including methanol, ethanol, and acetone for lignin separation from biomass. In addition, co-solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and acetone are used for the lignin separation from the biomass. The CELF pretreatment method of biomass works at high temperatures (160–180 °C) and produces various byproducts, including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), furfural (FF), and levulinic acid. These precursors can be used to produce value-added products (Cai et al., 2013). Free sugar production using advanced methods is still a costly approach in comparison to traditional methods (Table S1)."
5,Biological H2 production methods,"Biological hydrogen production can be accomplished by direct photolysis using green microalgae, indirect photolysis using cyanobacteria, photo fermentation using photosynthetic bacteria, and dark fermentation using hydrogen-producing microbe. Purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacteria (PNSB) such as Rhodobacter species are used to convert glucose or organic acids to H2 and CO2 in anaerobic conditions as given in Eq. (7). (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 O + 12 H 2 O Light energy → 12 H 2 + 6 CO 2 Theoretical H2 yields from butyric acid, propionic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, and acetic acid in photo fermentation pathways are given in Eqs. (8)–(13). (8) CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 6 H 2 O → 10 H 2 + 4 CO 2 (9) CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 4 H 2 O → 7 H 2 + 3 CO 2 (10) COOH CH 2 CHOHCOOH + 3 H 2 O → 6 H 2 + 4 CO 2 (11) COOH CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 4 H 2 O → 7 H 2 + 4 CO 2 (12) CH 3 CHOHCOOH + 3 H 2 O → 6 H 2 + 3 CO 2 (13) CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 These bacteria capture light to convert organic acids to H2 using oxygen sensitive nitrogenase. The production of H2 is limited by low nitrogenase activity and suppression of their expression in the presence of NH4. The photofermentation process is conducted under light illumination. Low light conversion efficiency, C/N ratio, heavy metal ions, oxygen inhibition to nitrogenase, and toxicity to PNSB caused by high substrate concentration are the limiting factors to achieve optimum H2 yields (Mishra et al., 2019). In the dark-fermentation process, H2 yield is dependent on substrate type, inoculum, pH, and temperature. The formation of byproducts contributes to a low yield of H2 on substrates. In addition, oxygen is a strong inhibitor of hydrogenase. However, H2 production using a biological way of utilizing biomass as a substrate is mainly focused on dark fermentation. Therefore, we have reviewed the dark fermentation in detail with a focus on metabolic pathways."
6,Dark fermentation,"3.1 Dark fermentation Carbohydrates are hydrolyzed to reducing sugars and subsequently anaerobically degraded to H2, CO2, volatile fatty acids, and alcohols by different pathways (Fig. 2 ) (Xia et al., 2017). Hydrogenase catalyzes the reduction of protons coupled with oxidation of the electron donors, such as ferredoxin to produce H2. H2-producing bacteria belong to the families Clostridiaceae, Sporolactobacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Bacillaceae, and Thermoanaerobacteriacea (Pugazhendhi et al., 2019). Four moles of H2 can be produced from 1 mol of glucose. However, experimental H2 yields are mostly lower than theoretical yields because of the formation of acetate, propionate, lactic acid, and alcohol (Hay et al., 2013). The near-equilibrium conditions can be maintained by designing the reactor, optimizing the process, and modifying the native metabolism of microbes using metabolic engineering approaches to achieve the theoretical yield of H2 production. Pyruvate is a crucial metabolite formed by anaerobic glucose catabolism. The breakdown of pyruvate is catalyzed by either pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) or pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR). In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA and formate or reduced ferredoxin (Hallenbeck et al., 2012). H2 can be produced using formate and reduced ferredoxin by formate lyase and hydrogenase, respectively. Acetic acid and butyric acids are the main byproducts of anaerobic treatment, along with H2. In the NADH pathway, NADH ferredoxin oxidoreductase oxidizes NADH and reduces ferredoxin to produce H2. The highest specific H2 yield of 4 mol H2/mol glucose or 497.8 mL H2/g-glucose can be obtained via the acetic acid pathway (Xia et al., 2016). The butyric acid pathway produces a specific H2 yield of 2 mol H2/mol glucose or 248.9 mL H2/g-glucose. Ethanol and lactic acid pathways do not produce H2. However, −2 mol H2/mol glucose and −4 mol H2/mol glucose are consumed in glucose fermentation during the production of propionic acid and caproic acid, respectively (Angenent et al., 2004; Xia et al., 2016). Strict anaerobic homoacetogenic bacteria belonging to families Eubacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, or Veillonellaceae can convert H2 and carbon dioxide into acetic acid and water (Saady, 2013). H2 production and consumption pathways are thermodynamically favorable, but accumulated H2 improves the thermodynamic favorability of H2 utilization pathways. Carbohydrate monomers have a major contribution in producing H2. The H2 production potential of monomers is given in Table 2 . The theoretical specific H2 yields of glucose, fructose, and galactose are 4 mol H2/mol monomer, while for xylose, it is 3.33 mol H2/mol monomer. Mannitol has more reducing power and generates more NADH than glucose in dark fermentations. The theoretical specific H2 yields of mannitol and glycerol are 5 mol H2/mol monomer and 3 mol H2/mol monomer, respectively (Xia et al., 2015)."
7,Recent approaches for biohydrogen production from biomass,"3.2 Recent approaches for biohydrogen production from biomass Three approaches have been used depending on whether pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation are carried out in the same reactor or separately (Fig. 3 ). 3.2.1 Separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) Enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation are carried out sequentially under optimum conditions in the SHF method (Fig. 3a). An efficient pretreatment method and optimum hydrolysis conditions are essential for the maximum production of biohydrogen (Ren et al., 2016). Lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysate is composed of hexose and pentose sugars. Microbes that can ferment both sugars are essential to further increase H2 production. A list of microbes reported to produce H2 from xylose is provided in Table 2. Thermoanaerobacter mathranii A3N, Clostridium beijerinckii YA001, and Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 were reported to produce 2.5, 2.31, and 2.19 mol H2 mol/mol xylose, respectively (Ren et al., 2016). The detoxification step is necessary to remove the inhibitors produced by traditional and advanced biomass pretreatment methods. Biological pretreatment and saccharification method are reported to avoid inhibitor generation. A white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been used for cornstalk pretreatment and H2 production (Zhao et al., 2012). The crude cellulase from Trichoderma viride is used for enzymatic saccharification to release reducing sugars (Zhao et al., 2013). Fermentable sugars are used to produce biohydrogen by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16. Taken together, the enzymatic saccharification efficiency was 21% higher than that of the control, and H2 production was 80.3 mL/g-pretreated cornstalk. Chu et al. have investigated the effect of particle size to produce H2 from the wheat stalk using mixed cultures (Chu et al., 2011). Their results demonstrated that the reduced size of the wheat stalk can be used to obtain H2 yield of 28.72 mL/g-substrate. Steam-exploded switchgrass is used for H2 production and H2 yield at 99.8 mL/g-substrate was obtained using this hydrolysate (Reginatto and Antônio, 2015). The effect of acid and alkali pretreatments on saccharification of grass and subsequent H2 production has been reported. Acid pretreatment was better for increasing H2 production from grass. A maximum H2 yield of 72.2 mL/g-substrate was obtained from acid-treated grass (Cui and Shen, 2012). 3.2.2 Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) In SSF, saccharification and H2 fermentation are carried out in the same reactor using different microbes or enzymes (Fig. 3b). SSF can reduce the operation time and cost of the process and also eliminate product inhibition during hydrolysis of cellulose (Ibrahim et al., 2015). SSF is used to produce H2 from steam-exploded corn straw using Clostridium butyricum AS1.209. The influence of process parameters, such as pH, enzyme loading, and solid to liquid ratio on H2 productivity was examined. H2 production rate and H2 yields from corn straw were 126 mL/g VSS·d and 68 mL/g SECS, respectively. In another study, the effect of acetic acid and enzyme loading on H2 production was examined. Acetic acid steam-exploded corn straw was used in SSF with Ethanoligenes harbinense 49 for H2 production. The H2 yield was improved with increasing acetic acid concentration and enzyme loading. The maximum specific H2 production rate and the H2 yield were 103 mL/g VSS d and 72 mL/g-substrate, respectively (Ren et al., 2016). The fermentable sugars obtained from fungal-pretreated cornstalk were used to produce biohydrogen by SSF using crude enzymes from T. viride and T. thermosaccharolyticum W16. The effect of multiple process parameters on H2 production was studied, and the highest H2 yield of 89.3 mL/g-substrate was obtained (Zhao et al., 2013). 3.2.3 Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) Combined biomass hydrolysis and H2 production are performed through a single step in CBP (Fig. 3c). This process is a one-stage design, economically feasible, and highly integrated as compared to SHF and SSF for H2 production. In SSF and SHF method, enzyme production is a separate process that accounts for a major cost. In addition, optimum pH and temperature requirements of enzymatic hydrolysis are different from the optimum fermentation conditions. In addition, time and energy consumption are higher which increases investment costs (Nagarajan et al., 2019). The CBP operation process is simple, enzyme additions eliminated, the risk of contamination is low, less energy is required, and investment is highly reduced as compared to SHF and SSF methods. CBP can be performed using mixed culture or co-culture whose activity supplement each other and their synergistic action resulting in improved hydrogen production. The use of co-cultures in CBP method has advantages including, reducing the fermentation time, increasing H2 yield, improving process stability, increasing substrate conversion, sequential utilization of substrates, and removal of inhibitory compounds (Nagarajan et al., 2019). The specific microorganism or consortia is selected based on the capability of cellulose and hemicellulose degradation and H2 production. These microbes produce enzymes to convert pentose and hexose sugars to H2. Thermophiles such as Caldicellulosiruptor sp., Clostridium thermocellum, and Thermoanaerobacterium sp., and mesophiles such as Thermotoga sp. and Clostridium sp. have been explored for H2 production (Cui and Shen, 2012; Song et al., 2014). Thermophiles grow at an elevated temperature, which reduces the chance of contamination by other microbes. In addition, they favor the thermodynamics of stoichiometric H2 yields at elevated temperatures. However, their slow growth rates and lower cell densities lead to lower volumetric rates of H2 production. Metabolic engineering approaches have been used to increase H2 production. Cha et al. studied the application of anaerobic thermophilic bacteria Caldicellulosiruptor bescii for CBP because they can grow on biomass without pretreatment (Cha et al., 2013). C. bescii produces H2, acetate, and lactate. Desulfovibrio species can grow on lactate as the sole energy source (Smith et al., 2019). Conversion of lactate to acetate, CO2, and hydrogen proceeds via pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and acetyl phosphate as intermediates. The reaction for lactate conversion is as follows, (14) CH 3 CHOHCOO − Lactate + 2 H 2 O → CH 3 COO − Acetate + 2.5 H 2 + HCO 3 − The effect of deletion of the l-lactate dehydrogenase gene from C. bescii was examined to increase the H2. The production of H2 is increased by 34% relative to the wild (C. bescii) type strain because of the redirection of electron flow from lactate to acetate and H2. The average yields of H2 were lower in raw biomass compared with those of pretreated biomass, indicating that the pretreatment step is essential to increase the final H2 production. It is challenging to compare the different H2 production processes because the reported studies were carried out using different substrates and operating conditions."
8,Cell-free synthetic pathways for H2 production,"3.3 Cell-free synthetic pathways for H2 production Cell-free systems are an emerging powerful technology focused on harnessing the potential of natural biological systems without using whole cells. Cell-free systems eliminate genetic regulation to enable a deep level of control of the design. Cell-free systems have many benefits over whole-cell biosystems, including no byproduct formation, fast reaction rates, easy separation of the target product, great engineering flexibility, metabolic load balancing, wide reaction conditions, and reduced toxicity effects (Sharma, 2019). The development cost of cell-free systems mainly depends on the carbohydrates, coenzymes, and enzymes used to produce H2. The development of stable enzymes may reduce the H2 production cost by up to $1.30/kg H2 (Zhang, 2011). Cell-free biology has been applied in H2 production by the biosynthetic multi-enzyme pathway. Rollin et al. purified >10 enzymes and combined them into the synthetic enzymatic pathways to demonstrate H2 production from glucose and xylose (Rollin et al., 2015). The maximum possible yield of H2 from glucose and xylose was achieved using this method. A kinetic model was designed to enhance the reaction rate and H2 yield. Diluted acid pretreatment to pretreat corn stover and lignocellulosic fractionation using organic solvents were used to release glucose and xylose. The efficiency of dilute acid pretreatment is affected by multiple factors, including reaction temperature, reaction time, acid concentration, and solid to liquid ratio of biomass and acid solution (Gonzales et al., 2016). The concentrated acids at low temperature or dilute acids at high temperatures used in acid pretreatment. The concentrated acid pretreatment cost is higher due to acid toxicity, corrosiveness, and neutralization of the pretreated slurry. In addition, acids cause sugar degradation to release the inhibitory byproducts including, furfurals, 5-HMF, phenolic compounds, and aldehydes. Pretreated biomass was hydrolyzed using a commercial mixture of cellulase and hemicellulase to enhance the release of sugars. An in-vitro artificial enzymatic pathway was designed to produce H2 from biomass. A four-module artificial enzymatic cascade was used to produce H2 at high yields. The volumetric H2 productivity increased by 3-fold after optimizing the enzyme loadings. Optimization of enzyme concentrations and reaction conditions further increased the H2 productivity to 54 mL H2/L/h. Cellobiose at 11.2 mol of H2/mol was obtained when cellobiose is used as a substrate (Ye et al., 2009)."
9,Cost and environmental impacts of H2 production methods,"3.4 Cost and environmental impacts of H2 production methods The cost of H2 production strongly depends on feedstock price, advancements in production technology, and availability of existing infrastructure. Steam methane reforming, coal, and biomass gasification methods are financially profitable for hydrogen production, while nuclear thermochemical cycles also appear to be economical to fossil fuel and biomass prices. The highest production cost per kg of H2 is for wind and solar electrolysis. The cost ($/kg) of different hydrogen production methods such as methane pyrolysis, biomass pyrolysis, biomass gasification, direct bio-photolysis, indirect bio-photolysis, dark fermentation, photo-fermentation, solar thermal electrolysis, and photo-electrolysis is 1.59–1.70, 1.25–2.20, 1.77–2.05, 2.13, 1.42, 2.57, 2.83, 5.10–10.49, and 10.36, respectively (Dodds, 2015). There are multiple environmental impacts associated with different H2 production methods. In the steam methane reforming method natural gas is used as feedstock, burning of natural gas adds to global warming. In addition, extracting and transporting natural gas could damage sensitive landscapes. Large carbon emissions occur while making H2 from coal or heavy oil in the gasification of coal and other hydrocarbons method. Also, coal mining can damage land and water quality. Global warming emissions are less in the gasification of biomass if feedstocks are sustainably cultivated. However, the production and transport of feedstocks may raise air, land, and ecosystem concerns (Dodds, 2015)."
10,Factors affecting H2 production,
11,Feedstock and inoculum type,"4.1 Feedstock and inoculum type The microbial conversion of biomass is affected by the lignin component. Therefore, pretreatment and hydrolysis are the necessary steps to release reducing sugars prior to fermentation for producing H2. The production of H2 is affected by the composition of the biomass, concentration of the biomass, and the pretreatment method used for the biomass. In dark fermentation, the theoretical maximum yields of hydrogen from hexoses and pentoses were 32% and 30–33%, respectively (Patel et al., 2018). Pure sugars such as glucose, xylose, mannose, cellobiose, fructose, galactose, maltose, and agricultural waste biomass such as wheat straw, rice straw have been used for biohydrogen production (Kothari et al., 2017). The optimum substrate concentration increases the hydrogen production in the dark fermentation process by minimizing the substrate inhibition, while high substrate concentrations cause unfavorable conditions including, variation in volatile fatty acids leading to change in pH, which inhibits the growth of H2 producing bacteria. Multiple substrates at 10 g/L concentrations were tested individually or a mixture of sugars for hydrogen production by Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27/Δldh using a modified MTC medium (Lai et al., 2014). H2 productivities were determined by comparing with glucose as a control. The SCUT27/Δldh strain produced H2 from glucose, xylose, mannose, cellobiose, fructose, galactose, maltose, beechwood xylan, and dextran. Among tested sugars, mannose and cellobiose showed the highest hydrogen production. SCUT27/Δldh converted xylose, mannose, and galactose to H2 with 70% relative hydrogen productivity compared to that using glucose. The maximum H2 yield of 1.86 mol H2/mol total sugar and a hydrogen production rate of 0.52 L/h were obtained. A pure single culture or mixed culture is used to produce H2 by dark fermentation. Strict anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, and aerobic bacteria have been used to produce H2 (Sołowski et al., 2018). Two moles of H2 per mole of glucose and 4 mol of H2 per mole of glucose were produced by facultative anaerobic bacteria and strictly anaerobic bacteria, respectively. H2 production is cost-effective using facultative anaerobic bacteria, including Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Escherichia coli, and Rhodopseudomonas. Clostridia are strictly anaerobic bacteria used in monocultures or mixtures for H2 production with good efficiency. Clostridium sp. produced 1.61 to 2.36 mol H2/mol glucose. The yields of H2 from Bacillus licheniformis were 0.37 and 1.1 mol H2/mol glucose in semi-continuous and batch mode, respectively (Bartacek et al., 2007). Bacillus coagulants produced H2 yields of 5.6, 1.9, and 1.2 mol H2/mol cellobiose, l-arabinose, and xylose, respectively. The highest H2 yields were 3.9 and 1 mol H2/mol glucose using Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter intermedium, respectively (Sudheer et al., 2020). Pure culture gives higher H2 production rates and H2 yields. However, sterile conditions are required to avoid contamination, which increases the operation cost. Mixed culture has more practical applications for full-scale industrial applications to produce H2 from complex organic substrates. However, a mixed culture can contain the substrate or product consuming species."
12,Temperature and pH,"4.2 Temperature and pH Temperature affects the growth rate of microbes, substrate hydrolysis and consumption, mass transfer rate of H2, and metabolic enzyme activities. Mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic bacteria have been used for H2 production (Pawar and van Niel, 2013). Thermophilic bacteria were reported to achieve a higher yield of H2, while mesophilic bacteria were reported to attain higher volumetric H2 production because of lower cell density. The optimum temperature for H2 production is dependent on the bacteria and substrate. Multiple studies have reported that the optimum temperature ranged from 28 to 82 °C. H2 production from rice bran, rice husk, and rice straw has been reported in mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyper thermophilic bacteria, respectively, at pH 7–7.5 (Shahbaz et al., 2020; Waheed and Williams, 2013). The H2 production potential of these bacteria was improved at temperatures ranging from 37 to 55 °C for all substrates. Variation in temperature affects the utilization of substrate, H2 yield and production rate, and formation of metabolites. Thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic bacterial cultures are preferred for higher hydrogen production as compared to mesophilic bacteria. The reported highest H2 yield from thermophile Thermoanaerobacterium sp. is close to the theoretical yield of 4 mol H2/mol glucose. pH affects the metabolism and hydrogenase activity of the bacteria. Hydrogenase activity is inhibited at low pH, resulting in a longer lag phase and inhibition of the dark fermentation process. Acidic pH favored the pathway to produce acetic acid and butyric acid, while higher initial pH favored the production of ethanol and propionate (Sołowski et al., 2018). At pH 5.5–7, higher specific H2 production rate was observed. Mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic bacteria have been used to produce H2 from rice straw and rice bran at pH 6–7, while in the case of rice waste, at pH 4–5.5 (Soares et al., 2020). The highest yield of H2 was 117.24 mL/g consumer sugar from rice bran at pH 5.5, while the highest volume of H2 was achieved at pH 6.5 (Azman et al., 2016; Sołowski et al., 2018). The highest H2 production was 509.2 mL/g consumer sugar from wheat straw hydrolysate at pH 6.5. The conversion of glucose and xylose to H2 was investigated with or without pH control and different dilution rates in Clostridium sp. strain No. 2. The maximum H2 production rates of 21.03 and 20.4 mmol/h/L were obtained from xylose and glucose, respectively."
13,Metal ions,"4.3 Metal ions Biohydrogen production process requires metal ions, including Fe, Ni, and Mg (Yang and Wang, 2018b). These are cofactors for enzymes involved in the metabolic and transport processes of microorganisms. Hydrogenases are divided into three different types based on the presence of active site metal including, iron-iron (FeFe) hydrogenase, nickel-iron (NiFe) hydrogenase, and iron (Fe) hydrogenase (Greening et al., 2016). Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular H2. In hydrogenase active sites, carbon monoxide and cyanide groups are bound to the iron ions, and exists as an ordered [4Fe-4S] subcluster linked to a 2Fe subcluster unit through a bridging cysteine thiolate which provides an organometallic character (Lubitz et al., 2014; Peters et al., 2015). Catalytic mechanism of NiFe-hydrogenases in the direction of H2 oxidation is divided into six steps including, a diffusion of H2 molecules from protein to active site, splitting of H2 after binding to the metallic active site, hydride oxidation to H+ , transfer of H+ from the bimetallic active site to water solvent, electron transfer to the redox cluster from the active site, and intermolecular electron transfer to redox center form the cluster (Rodríguez-Maciá et al., 2019). The higher concentration of metals decreases the availability of nutrients and roots the destruction of membrane function. The concentration of Ni and Fe greatly influences the fermentative biohydrogen production process. Mass transfer limitation was observed at a higher concentration of Fe by forming cell clumps (Kothari et al., 2017). These metals affect the activity of hydrogenase. The high concentration of nickel promotes fermentative H2 production by inhibiting the activity of nickel-iron hydrogenase. Clostridium pasteurianum was found to produce lactate as a major product at low Fe concentration (<10 mmol/L), while C. acetobutyricum was found to produce H2 as a major product at high Fe concentration (<up to 25 mmol/L) during glucose fermentation. Nickel-iron (NiFe) hydrogenase is activated by the addition of Ni. The maximum H2 production of 296.1 mL/g-glucose was achieved at 0.1. mg/L of Ni2+ concentration. The optimum concentration of these metals depends on the bacteria and temperature used for operations. The optimum concentration of iron ion was 20 mg/L to achieve a yield of 3.31 mol H2/mol glucose. Moreover, a yield of 232 mg H2/g glucose was obtained at 0.1 mg/L Ni2+ ion concentration."
14,"Nitrogen, sulfate, and phosphate","4.4 Nitrogen, sulfate, and phosphate The growth of H2-producing bacteria requires inorganic and organic nitrogen sources, including ammonium chloride, urea, and ammonium bicarbonate as well as yeast extract, peptone, and corn steep liquor, respectively. Organic nitrogen sources in fermentation were reported to produce a higher yield of H2. Nitrogen-limiting conditions are inhibitory for H2 production using dark fermentation (Kargi et al., 2012). The inorganic components like nitrogen, sulfate, and phosphate are essential macronutrients for the growth of microbes but they can cause inhibitory effects to reduce the H2 production. The dark fermentation process is inhibited at high ammoniacal nitrogen concentration and high C/N ratio in the feedstock. High ammoniacal nitrogen concentration hinders with intracellular pH and inhibits the enzymatic activity. Balancing of appropriate C/N ratio is highly required to avoid nitrogen induced inhibition in dark biohydrogen fermentation (Kothari et al., 2017). H2 production did not increase regardless of the concentration of sulfate used. The limiting concentration of sulfate decreased the optical density and H2 production. Phosphate is required to maintain the buffering capacity of the medium. An intermediate limiting concentration of the phosphate increases the yields of H2 in bacteria. The highest H2 production was achieved using 600 mg/L of phosphate in the form of N2HPO4, while 40% reduction in hydrogen production was observed at 30% lower concentrations of N2HPO4."
15,Biomass derived inhibitors,"4.5 Biomass derived inhibitors Various inhibitors get produced during the pretreatment of biomass as discussed in Section 2.2. Due to the small size, inhibitors can enter though cell membrane easily and damage the cell's internal structure, and change its cell morphology, inhibiting RNA and protein synthesis (Basak et al., 2020). Penetration of weak acids penetrates through cell membrane disrupt ion and sugar transport, resulting in the inhibition of cell growth. Weak acids also act as energy drainers by inhibiting ATP regeneration and glycolytic enzymes. These inhibitor compounds decrease the production of the target product by affecting the cell growth and decreasing the sugar uptake rate. The higher toxicity of furfural inhibits the central carbon metabolism, and the furan derivatives affect amino acid biosynthesis and result in cell organelles damage. The toxic byproducts formation leads to a significant reduction in H2 yields from pretreated lignocellulosic substrates. The H2 production using corn stover hydrolysate by Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 was significantly inhibited by 5-HMF, furfural, vanillin, and syringaldehyde (Lin et al., 2020). At 1.0 g/L, higher inhibition was observed in presence of 5-HMF than furfural (50.2% and 17.9% reduction in relative H2 production respectively), whereas syringaldehyde resulted 54.3% reduction in relative H2 production. Any significant inhibitory effect was not observed in presence of vanillin. Fascinatingly, 5-HMF showed stimulation in H2 production as compared to the control by a mixed culture at a comparatively low concentration (0.6 g/L) with an increase in H2 yield and production rate by 26% and 4% compared respectively (Anburajan et al., 2018). Siqueira and Reginatto assessed the individual effects of 5-HMF (0.1–1.0 g/L), furfural (0.25–2.0 g/L), vanillin (0.25–2.0 g/L), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (0.15–1.0 g/L), and syringaldehyde (0.25–2.0 g/L) on H2 production in a mineral medium with glucose and trace elements by an anaerobic sludge mixed culture (Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). Opposite to the common hormesis observation, even at lower concentrations (0.25 and 0.1 g/L) furfural and 5-HMF were found to be inhibitory for H2 production. A significant decrease in H2 yield (down to zero) was observed when furfural and 5-HMF concentration was increased above 2.0–2.5 g/L (Siqueira and Reginatto, 2015). It is noteworthy that, the concentration of lignocellulosic inhibitor determines its antagonistic or toxic effects as at higher concentration, the inhibitor will be more toxic. According to Lin et al., vanillin, and syringaldehyde showed higher inhibitory effects than 5-HMF and furfural when the mixed culture was used as an inoculum (Lin et al., 2015). A significant decrease in H2 yield was observed using E. aerogenes and E. coli co-culture system by Sharma and colleagues after addition (2.0 g/L) of syringaldehyde (42.26%) and vanillin (49.40%). Whereas the addition of furfural and 5-HMF resulted in 27.0% and 37.2% reduction in H2 yield, respectively (Sharma and Melkania, 2017). The effective degradation of furan derivatives over phenolic compounds at lower concentrations using mixed or co-cultures of H2 producing microorganisms, justifies the lower toxicity of furan derivatives than phenolic compounds (Sharma and Melkania, 2017). Giraldeli and colleagues studied the effects of mixtures of levulinic acid (2.1 g/L), 5-HMF (0.6 g/L), and formic acid (0.8 g/L) on hydrogen production by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and Clostridium beijerinckii Br21 (Giraldeli et al., 2018). The Mixture is reported to inhibit H2 production by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 by 89% and C. beijerinckii Br21 by 83%."
16,Methods to enhance hydrogen production,
17,Co-cultivation,"5.1 Co-cultivation Biohydrogen production using pure culture is the preferred process, but its main limitations are substrate availability and the requirement of a sterilization process. The presence of both obligate and facultative anaerobic microbes can help to improve the biohydrogen process when organic wastes are used as a carbon source. In this type of co-culture system, some microbes hydrolyze complex raw materials into free sugars, while others utilize these to produce free sugars without competing with each other (Fig. 4a) (Cárdenas and Zapata, 2019). Clostridium is unable to produce cellulolytic enzymes and to utilize complex substrates. Morales-Martinez et al. used bovine ruminal fluid (containing cellulolytic degrading bacteria) to improve the hydrolysis of agave biomass and provide free sugars to Clostridium for H2 production (Morales-Martínez et al., 2020). Zhang et al. studied Enterobacter cloacae for H2 production and reported 1.5 mol of H2/glucose with acetic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol as other side products (Fig. 4b) (Y. Zhang et al., 2017). Rhodobacter sphaeroides HY01 has the ability to utilize volatile fatty acids and produce H2. To improve H2 production, Zhang et al. co-cultured E. cloacae with R. sphaeroides HY01 using cornstalk as raw material, and the process resulted in 226 mL of H2/g of cornstalk, which was 170 and 38% higher compared to that by dark fermentation and photofermentation alone, respectively (Y. Zhang et al., 2017). Photosynthetic bacteria Rhodopseudomonas palustris is not able to hydrolyze and utilize cellulose. Hitit et al. co-cultured Cellulomonas fimi and R. palustris, where the first performed cellulose hydrolysis and provided fermentable sugar to R. palustris for growth and H2 production (44 mmol H2/L) (Hitit et al., 2017). Hasibar et al. explored coculture (E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum) inside a microbial fuel cell (MFC) where a voltage of 0.8 V is applied and cellobiose was used as a carbon source and process resulted in 0.93 mmol/L/h H2 production (Hasibar et al., 2020)."
18,Mixed substrate,"5.2 Mixed substrate The utilization of pure substrates (glucose, xylose) for biohydrogen production is not a feasible and economic approach. Integration of the waste treatment process with biohydrogen production is receiving attention. The use of co-substrates having complementary characteristics can provide complete media for hydrogen production (Pachapur et al., 2015). Co-digestion of mixed substrates leads to an increase in biohydrogen production due to better nutrient balance, dilution of toxic compounds, helps to maintain the pH level (without additional alkali), and omit the requirement of an external nitrogen source (Fig. 4c, d) (Lopez-Hidalgo et al., 2018). Wheat straw hydrolysate, which lacks nitrogen content, and its co-fermentation with cheese whey (act as nitrogen source) was studied by Lopez-Hidalgo et al., 2018, and the process results in improved hydrogen production rate i.e., 66.6 to 89.5 H2/L/h (Fig. 4c) (Lopez-Hidalgo et al., 2018). Pachapur et al. studied co-fermentation of apple pomace hydrolysate with crude glycerol using co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. butyricum to increase H2 production (26 mmol H2/L) with reduced byproducts (Pachapur et al., 2015). Li et al. increased H2 production from sugarcane molasses by 28% by using Ginkgo biloba leaves as a co-substrate and reported that GB alters the metabolic flux of Ethanoligenes harbinense Yuan-3 from the ethanol pathway to the acetate pathway (Fig. 4d) (Li et al., 2020a). H2 production from cellulose using mixed microbial consortia is challenging as it requires pretreatment at a higher temperature (90 °C) to suppress the H2-consuming bacteria, and during this process, Clostridium forms spores. To overcome this, Zagrodnik et al. used starch as an additional substrate to support the growth of Clostridium, and the process resulted in increased H2 production from 0.3 H2/Lmedium to 1.2 H2/Lmedium (Zagrodnik and Seifert, 2020). Yang et al. studied co-fermentation of sewage sludge and grass residue, analyzed the effect of various substrate concentration on H2 production, and reported that high substrate concentration caused the accumulation of metabolic products (acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate, and ethanol) with a significant decrease of pH which resulted in inhibition of microbes metabolic activity and decrease in hydrogen production efficiency (Yang and Wang, 2019a, 2019b)."
19,Pathway engineering,"5.3 Pathway engineering Different metabolic engineering strategies have been reported to improve H2 production, such as engineering of microbes, engineering of existing H2 production pathways, and engineering of new pathways (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2012). Cha et al. engineered the C. bescii strain, an anaerobic thermophilic bacterial strain able to grow on biomass without the requirement of any pretreatment and produce lactate, acetate, and H2 as the main fermentation products. Cha et al. engineered C. bescii by deleting the l-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldh), and the resulting strain failed to produce lactate, with an increase of 21–34% in H2 production being reported from cellobiose (Cha et al., 2013). The NADH-dependent reduced ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (nfnAB) complex catalyzes electron transfer between reduced ferredoxin and NAD(P)+, which is critical for the production of NAD(P)H-dependent products such as H2 and ethanol. Yang et al. studied the effect of nfnAB deletion on Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27 and reported that the mutant strain had a higher ratio of NADH/NAD+, which resulted in increased production of H2 by 41% when glucose was used as a carbon source (Li et al., 2019). The majority of H2 production occurs through the breakdown of pyruvate formed during substrate catabolism. During glycolysis, the conversion of glucose to pyruvate produces ATP and reduces NAD into NADH. To maintain the glycolysis process continuously, oxidation of NADH, which is achieved by the production of various reduced products, is necessary. Two pathways are involved in pyruvate breakdown: in facultative anaerobes (E. coli), pyruvate breakdown to formate and acetyl-CoA by catalytic action of pyruvate formate lyase (pfl) and ethanol, with lactate and acetate being the main products, while in strict anaerobes (Clostridia), pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase is involved and produces acetyl-CoA and CO2, while ethanol, butyrate, butanol, and acetone are the other products (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2012; Mudhoo et al., 2011). Zhang et al. overexpressed formate lyase activator (fhlA) in Enterobacter cloacae. A significant enhancement in cumulative H2 production, i.e., 188%, from corn stalk hydrolysate in 24 h was reported for the recombinant strain (Q. Zhang et al., 2020)."
20,Addition of supporting material,"5.4 Addition of supporting material Theoretically, 4 mol of H2 can be produced using 1 mol of glucose while only 2.42 mol H2/mol of glucose can be obtained by dark fermentation (Srivastava et al., 2020). Hydrogenase is the main enzyme involved in H2 production during dark photofermentation. Usage of various materials such as gold, copper, silver, hydrotalcites, and activated carbon has been reported to promote H2 production (Fig. 4e, f) (Table 3 ). Activated carbon acts as anti-acid, which allows microbes to immobilize on their inter-laminar structure, while metal ions (Zn, Mg, Na, Fe) provide micronutrients to microbes for growth (Sybounya et al., 2019). The addition of various nanomaterials, such as nickel, iron, gold, silver, copper, and titanium oxide has also been reported to increase H2 production, as these may act as oxygen scavengers or as cofactors at the active site of hydrogenase and nitrogenase, enabling rapid e− transfer from the electron donor to its respective e− acceptor (Fig. 4e). Biological H2 production using lignocellulosic biomass by dark fermentation resulted in a lower yield due to poor utilization of acidic metabolites produced by microbes during the fermentation (Srivastava et al., 2020). Various volatile fatty acids (VFAs), i.e., acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid, produced during the fermentation caused a drop in pH and affected microbial growth; hence, there is a need to maintain culture conditions to promote H2 production. Immobilization of microorganisms on nanomaterials improved pH and thermal stability of microbes and reduced the lag phase, which resulted in increased growth and H2 accumulation (Engliman et al., 2017). Further, the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biohydrogen using dark fermentation pretreatment of biomass is required. Nanomaterials have the potential to enable the pretreatment process under less extreme conditions, increase the thermal and pH stability of cellulase enzyme, speed up the process, reduce chemical usage, remove lignin, and increase fermentable sugar yield. Li et al. studied the effects of Fe3O4 nanomaterials on lignocellulose degradation by Phanerochaete chrysosporium and reported that nanoparticles participated in the Fanton reaction and affected biomass degradation by regulating enzyme secretion (Huang et al., 2019)."
21,Integrated approach for other bioenergy resources along with hydrogen,"During dark fermentation, various byproducts, such as lactic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol are produced along with hydrogen. To make the process more economical, recovery of these products from the fermented broth is desirable."
22,Coproduction of bio alcohols and volatile fatty acids,"6.1 Coproduction of bio alcohols and volatile fatty acids Lignocellulosic biomass is a complex substrate, and to make the process environmentally friendly, biomass treatment using enzymatic methods is preferred. Aerobic bacteria secrete extracellular enzymes and act together to degrade cellulose while anaerobe bacteria produce an extracellular complex cellulosome to hydrolyze cellulose effectively. Mixed culture can be utilized for simultaneous production of alcohols, VFA, and H2 (Fig. 5a). Pang et al. isolated a cellulolytic E. coli from the bovine rumen, which could produce ethanol (0.36 g/L) and hydrogen (4.41 mL/g hydrogen from corn straw) (Pang et al., 2017). Thermophiles have a higher growth rate and are able to degrade a wide range of substrates and produce few undesired products compared to the mesophiles (Sigurbjornsdottir and Orlygsson, 2012). The thermophile Thermoanaerobacterium AK54, isolated from a hot spring in Iceland, was able to utilize a wide range of carbon sources and produce various end products (hydrogen, ethanol, lactate, acetate, and carbon dioxide). Sigurbjornsdottir and Orlygsson et al. reported that lowering the hydrogen partial pressure at the end of glucose degradation can direct byproduct production away from lactate and towards hydrogen, acetate, and ethanol. Thermoanaerobacterium AK54 could produce ethanol (24.2 mM) and hydrogen (6.7 mol H2/g TS) from cellulose hydrolysate (Sigurbjornsdottir and Orlygsson, 2012). Lopez-Hidalgo et al. explored E. coli WDHL for bioethanol and biohydrogen production using wheat straw hydrolysate as a substrate and reported 8.9 g ethanol/L and 3277 mL hydrogen (Lopez-Hidalgo et al., 2017). The acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation pathway is well known for its butanol production, which requires butyric acids to induce solvent production genes. The addition of external butyric acid adds to the cost and reduces sugar utilization. To overcome this issue, Li et al. used a two-step approach for butanol and H2 production from rice straw, without the involvement of any enzymes. In the first step, lignocellulosic biomass was converted to volatile fatty acids (VFA) using the carboxylate platform. Carboxylate platform was achieved by performing fermentation of peptone cellulose medium (PCM) and 20 g/L rice straw with consortium DCB517 in a 500 mL capacity serum bottle. VFA was further used as a substrate for ABE fermentation with Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052; the process resulted in 5897 mL/L H2 and 13.8 g/L butanol, respectively (Li et al., 2018). Coproduction of volatile fatty acids along with H2 as the main product from lignocellulosic hydrolysate has also been studied by many researchers. Some plant biomass (sweet sorghum stalk) is composed of non-structural sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) and structural (hemicellulose and cellulose) carbohydrates and affects hydrogen production. Sucrose can be directly converted to hydrogen by anaerobic microbes by fermentative butyric and acetic acid pathway resulting in a theoretical yield of 2–4 mol of hydrogen per mol of hexose sugar utilized, respectively (Hussy et al., 2005). Morsy et al. engineered E. coli HD701 by heterologous expression of invertase from S. cerevisiae and recombinant strain able to produce 0.48 mol H2/mol of reducing sugar (Morsy and Ibrahim, 2016). NiFe-hydrogenase receives excess electrons from reduced ferredoxin and produces hydrogen, and the presence of exogenous reducing sugar provides a reductive environment to the cells and there is a possibility to increase hydrogen production by supplementation of reducing sugars (Chongsuksantikul et al., 2014). Chongsuksantikul et al. studied the effect of additional fructose on Synechocystis sp. Strain PCC 6803 dark fermentation and reported an increase in hydrogen production (0.025 to 0.092 mmol/L/h). Islam et al. used a two-step dark fermentation approach to utilize structural and non-structural carbohydrates of sweet sorghum stalk for VFA and H2 production using Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum. In the first step, C. thermosaccharolyticum utilized nonstructural sugars and produced H2 (3.27 nmol/g substrate), acetic acid (1.18 g/L), and butyric acid (0.97 g/L). Residual lignocellulosic waste was pretreated with dilute sulfuric acid and used again for C. thermosaccharolyticum fermentation, with the process resulting in 2.5 nmol H2/g substrate, acetic acid (0.99 g/L), and butyric acid (1.09 g/L) (Islam et al., 2018)."
23,Coproduction of methane and hydrogen,"6.2 Coproduction of methane and hydrogen Hydrogen has a high energy density (142 kJ/g) and is followed by CH4 (55.5 kJ/g) (Kumari and Das, 2018). The mixture of H2 and CH4 is called hythane, and when produced using the biological route, it is called biohythane. Lignocellulosic biomass is first hydrolyzed into free sugars, and then the hydrolyzed material is used by acidogenic microbes for CO2, H2, and VFA production. CO2 and H2 are dissolved in the medium and utilized by hydrogenotrophic methanogens to produce CH4, while acetogenic bacteria transform acetic acid into methane and CO2. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens scavenge H2 and reduce H2 production. The anaerobic process can be shifted to dark fermentation to inhibit methanogens and methane production as well as accelerate H2 and CO2 production (Sikora et al., 2017). Cheng et al. first used cassava residue pretreated with microwaves for H2 production, and then the residual media after dark fermentation were used for methane production. Dark fermentation resulted in 102.1 mL H2/g TVS and 75.4 mL methane/g TVS (Cheng et al., 2015). Kumari et al. used sugarcane bagasse and water hyacinth biomass for biohythane and produced H2 (303 mL/g COD) and methane (142 mL/g COD), respectively (Kumari and Das, 2018). Sugarcane bagasse is processed using different pretreatment methods including, microwave assisted acid and alkaline (NaOH) conditions, ball milling and wet disk milling, ethanosolvent pretreatment, using 3-N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO). Microwave assisted pretreatment was more efficient than conventional heating pretreatment to produce 4-fold higher reducing sugar in less time (Zhu et al., 2016). Glucose and xylose hydrolysis yields were higher in ball milling pretreatment methods (Kumar and Sharma, 2017). Alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment reduced the lignin content to produce H2 yields of 303 mL/g COD and increased substrate conversion efficiency close to 86% (Kumari and Das, 2019). The four different engineered bacteria overexpressing hydrogenase were used to produce H2 using a water hyacinth pretreated with microwave-aided dilute acid pretreatment. Among them, E. cloacae/HPP showed the highest hydrogen yield of 74.9 mL/g-total volatile solids from pretreated water hyacinth (Song et al., 2017). The recirculated two-phase anaerobic digestion system (R-TPAD) combines the dark fermentation and methane production processes in which (a) H2 production is performed in the first stage; then (b), in the second stage, spent media with by-products from the first stage are subjected to CH4 production, and after methanogenesis (c), alkaline media with microorganisms (methanogenesis effluent) recirculate back into the dark fermentation unit (Fig. 5b). Qin et al. studied co-digestion of paper waste and food waste using R-TPAD and produced 79 NL-H2/kg-VSfed and 329 NL-CH4/kg-VSfed (Qin et al., 2019). Biohydrogen and methane production potential also depends on lignocellulose composition and structure. Monlau et al. studied 20 lignocellulosic residues and developed a partial least square model (PLS) to predict the effect of lignocellulose composition and structure on biohydrogen and methane production. According to this model, only sugars have a positive role in H2 production, while in case of methane-soluble sugars, protein and amorphous hemicellulose showed a positive effect, while lignin and crystalline cellulose showed negative effect (Monlau et al., 2012)."
24,Techno-economic analysis,"Economic viability plays a crucial role in the commercialization of lignocellulosic bio-hydrogen. Many biofuels and lignocellulosic-based bio-products suffer in regard to commercialization due to their reduced energy production in comparison with fossil sources. Economic viability identifies bottlenecks at an early phase, which helps to conserve resources (Kadhum et al., 2018). Typically, the feasibility assessment happens in the pilot phase of a project. However, for renewable-energy systems, performing an economic assessment at the pilot-stage might be bereft as large-scale involves a complete end-to-end solution. Most research work is performed at the micro-level for understanding the basic phenomenon and smaller-systems; however, understanding the industrial-world and its functionalities needs an eagle-eye perspective and is essential for researchers. Process simulators such as AspenPlus or the Superpro Designer program help in carrying out techno-economic analysis. The first step in the techno-economic analysis is to add the components necessary to run the simulation, such as carbohydrates, any vented gases, chemicals, and solutions. Next, the estimation of physical properties of the added components identifies any missing parameters that are critical for running the simulation. Later, stream level information is fed to the simulation for unit operation. Flowsheet development is performed by combining information of different streams and unit operations (Fig. S1). A completed flowsheet mimics the real-world operating scenario. The next step is to assess the flowsheet for mass and energy balances (Schefflan, 2016). Afterward, economic evaluation is performed to identify key parameters, such as capital cost, operating cost, and payback period. Flowsheet development is data-driven, where unit-operations need information, such as operating conditions. In situations where there is a lack of information, assumptions based on the literature are used. There are various costs associated with biohydrogen production from lignocelluloses, including the cultivation and harvest costs of biomass. The cost of lignocelluloses varies between 22 and 85 $/t, depending on the type and availability of biomass (Karkee, 2016). There is a positive linear correlation between the cost of biomass procured to the production cost of biofuels (Rajendran and Murthy, 2017). The biomass cost increases annually, due to an increase in the cost of fertilizer, labor, inflation, and interests, and lack of support to farmers. In addition to cultivation and harvest, transportation costs are associated with the biomass. Transportation of biomass via ship within the EU region costs approximately 0.001–0.013 $/dry t-km. The transportation costs of biomass via truck for a distance of up to 35 km is 0.42 $/t-km (Labriet, 2013). The next associated cost in biohydrogen production is for its processing within the plant. This includes the capital and running expenses of the plant. The capital expenses include site development, equipment purchasing and installation, and the working capital. The running expenses include the cost associated with the functioning of the plant, such as raw materials, labor, utilities, and taxes. Capital expenses are a one-time investment, while the operational expenses recur annually (Turton et al., 2008). These expenses vary depending on the biomass, type of pretreatment used, operating conditions of the reactor, and the H2 yield and productivity. The Table S2 outlines the technical and economic summary of biohydrogen production, which were reported in the literature. Ljunggren et al. (2011) studied the effect of combining dark- and photo-fermentation of barley straw to H2 in comparison with bioethanol production. The ethanol production cost was 23.2 $/GJ (energy basis), while that of biohydrogen was 502.10 $/GJ. H2 production was 20 times more expensive than producing ethanol from barley straw. Lower productivity, decreased energy efficiency, and buffer costs contribute to the higher production costs of H2. Photo-fermentation and its associated unit operations alone contribute to 90% of the production costs. This shows that photo-fermentation is not a feasible method for H2 production. H2 obtained from a combined process of bio-oil and fast pyrolysis resulted in production cost of 45.24 $/GJ. These are one-tenth of the costs using the combined process of the dark- and photo-fermentation (Sarkar and Kumar, 2010). Other estimates on the production cost of hydrogen by a two-step process (hydrogen and methane) varied between 59.5 and 404.8 $/GJ (Ljunggren and Zacchi, 2010). Several factors affect the profitability and production cost of H2. H2 productivity, efficient conversion of sugars, and acetic acid concentration are some of the key parameters that are sensitive to production cost. An increase in H2 productivity by 20% decreases the production cost by 8% (Grabarczyk et al., 2019)."
25,Future perspectives,"Renewable H2 is the cleanest energy source available on the planet as it releases only water vapor upon combustion. Commercializing H2 on a large- and wide-scale would not only mitigate emissions but also improve environmental sustainability. Lignocellulosic biomass for ethanol and other products has been in research for several decades now, and the rate of commercialization is not promising. The slow rate can be attributed to the lack of proven technologies in pilot/pre-industrial scales, support by governmental policies, and scientific advances that did not reduce the gap between research and implementation. Enhanced molecular and fundamental approaches have helped in further understanding lignocelluloses; however, various segments have been understood minimally. For instance, economic analyses of lignocellulosic ethanol and H2 were reported only after the 2000s. Similarly, studies on the logistics of biomass supply chain and availability are infrequent in the literature. Such studies are necessary to complement laboratory-driven pretreatment systems and processes. The feasibility of lignocellulosic biohydrogen production needs a radical approach where integrated biorefinery platforms provide the possibility of a viable solution (Valdez-Vazquez and Sanchez, 2018). One of the key hindrances in lignocellulosic H2 production is productivity, i.e., the yield reported in the literature (Grabarczyk et al., 2019). Significant improvements are necessary to increase the productivity and the possible practical yield derived from the biomass. From an economic perspective, the use of multiple unit operations reduces the profitability of the process. Recently, combined bioprocessing/single pot biorefinery shows promising trends on the technical front; however, detailed economic analyses are necessary to understand whether this approach is feasible (Zhao et al., 2014). Finally, coupling H2 production with carbon capture reduces the biogenic emissions. This acts as a cleaner energy system with negative emissions (Anuar et al., 2020)."
26,Conclusions,"Despite considerable technological advancements in biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass, there remain challenges in industrial scale implementation of this technology. Pretreatment methods are not efficient and economic, as most of the methods result in the production of by-products which affect microbial growth and reduce hydrogen yield. Utilization of pure culture results in high biohydrogen yield but most of the microbes lack the ability to utilize complex substrates. There is a need to search for microbes that have the potential to produce biohydrogen using a consolidated process. To make biohydrogen production practical more attention should be paid to metabolic engineering to shift carbon flow towards hydrogen production with a minimum synthesis of reduced by-products."
