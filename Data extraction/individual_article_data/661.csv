0,Introduction,"Enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones is an important organic transformation since the enantiopure secondary alcohols obtained are often employed as intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals, argochemicals and advanced materials. 1 Among the different catalytic methods, the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation is of great interest. It avoids the use of flammable hydrogen as a reducing agent, representing a mild, practical, and safe alternative to catalytic hydrogenation. 2 In 1990s, Noyori et al. found that a ruthenium η6-arene complex in combination with monotosylated diamines could serve as efficient catalysts for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones. 3 This significant development has led to the intense exploration of the Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation with substantial emphasis on the use of new chiral ligand scaffolds, of which chiral amino alcohols are arguably among those with the greatest utility. Noyori et al. reported that a Ru-catalyst bearing some simple amino alcohols such as ephedrine 1 showed high catalytic activity and enantioselectivity (95% yield and 91% ee) in the reduction of ketones. 4 Andersson et al. have developed 2-azanorboronyl based amino alcohol 2, which displayed good to excellent enantioselectivities (85–99% ee) in the Ru-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation. 5 Wills et al. used (1R,2S)-cis-1-aminoindan-2-ol 3 as a ligand in the Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, achieving good to excellent enantioselectivities (see Fig. 1 ). 6 Besides these representative ligands, there are a number of chiral amino alcohol ligands that were reported to be efficient for the Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. 1,7 A structural analysis disclosed that most of these ligands belong to 1,2-amino alcohols in nature, and few other types of amino alcohols, such as 1,3- or 1,4-amino alcohols have been used in the Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. With this background, we report herein the rapid synthesis of a new type of amino alcohols 4 having a 1,4-amino alcohol structural feature from readily available (S)-1-phenylethylamine (Scheme 1 ) along with results concerning their use as ligands for the Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. It has been demonstrated that these new amino alcohol ligands were efficient for this transformation, displaying good to excellent conversions (71–100%) and moderate to good enantioselectivities (67–95% ee) for a variety of aromatic alkyl ketones."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Synthesis of chiral amino alcohols 4a–d from (S)-1-phenylethylamine,"2.1 Synthesis of chiral amino alcohols 4a–d from (S)-1-phenylethylamine These chiral amino alcohols can be prepared from commercially available (S)-1-phenylethylamine through a one-step transformation as outlined in Scheme 1. 8 The treatment of (S)-1-phenylethylamine with n-BuLi at −35°C, followed by a slow addition of neat Me3SiCl, generated the monosilylated product, N-(trimethylsilyl)-1-phenylethylamine in situ. 9 The latter was dilithiated by further addition of 3equiv of n-BuLi at −35°C and then quenched with a variety of carbonyl compounds including formaldehyde, acetone, cyclohexanone, and benzophenone. Following work-up and crystallization, amino alcohols 4a–d were produced in 11.9–37.9% yields. Although relatively low yields were obtained in this transformation, few by-products besides the starting material, (S)-1-phenylethylamine 5, were detected. Most of the unreacted (S)-1-phenylethylamine 5 can be recovered by column chromatography."
3,Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aromatic alkyl ketones,"2.2 Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aromatic alkyl ketones With these newly developed amino alcohol ligands in hand, we then investigated their efficiency in the Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone, and the results are summarized in Table 1 . In a typical experiment, ruthenium complexes were prepared in situ by refluxing 0.5mol% of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 in combination with an appropriate amount of ligand (S)-4a–d in 2-propanol for 0.5h. The resulting solution was then used for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone in the presence of 10mol% of KOH in 2-propanol at ambient temperature for 1h, using a substrate/catalyst ratio of 100. Initially, the ratio of ligand to [Ru] was examined. The results indicated that the ratio of ligand to [Ru] had some influence on the enantioselectivity, and increasing the ratio of ligand to [Ru] tended to promote the enantioselectivity (entries 1–3). We next evaluated the effect of the ligand structure on catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. As presented in Table 1, the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation proceeded smoothly with all amino alcohol ligands 4a–d, giving conversions of 98% (entries 3–6). However, the enantioselectivity dramatically changed with these ligands, ranging between 54% and 86% ee. Among these amino alcohol ligands, the simplest member, 4a bearing a primary hydroxyl moiety gave the best ee-value of 86% (entry 3). These results suggested that the structure of these newly developed amino alcohols significantly affects the enantioselectivity, and that less sterically demanding ligands seem to be more favorable for achieving high enantioselectivity. The reduction proved to be highly sensitive to the catalyst precursors (entries 3, 7 and 8). Comparison of the results obtained with various catalyst precursors clearly showed that high conversion and good enantioselectivity were obtained only when [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 was used (entries 3, 7 and 8). Further work on the screening of various bases indicated that KOH was a better choice (entries 3, 9 and 10). The reduction can be completed in 5min when it was performed at reflux temperature (entry 11). However, the enantioselectivity was reduced to 76% ee. Lowering the reaction temperature to −10°C resulted in decreased reaction rate but increased enantioselectivity (92% ee) (entry 12). Having identified the best amino alcohol ligand and established the optimal reduction conditions ([RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 as the catalyst precursor, 4a as chiral ligand, KOH as base, performed at −10°C), we then undertook studies on different aromatic alkyl ketone substrates (Fig. 2 ). The results are summarized in Table 2 . As in the reduction of acetophenone 6a, all of the substituted acetophenones 6b–6i were also reduced smoothly in high conversions (91–100%) and moderate to good enantioselectivities (69–94% ee) (entries 1–9). The substrates can be grouped based on their electronic and steric properties. Substrates bearing electron-donating substituents generally gave better enantioselectivities, but a lower reaction rate in comparison with their counterparts. For example, substrate 6e with a 4-methyl group on the phenyl ring was reduced in 86% ee and 93% conversion after 5h (entry 5); while the reduction of 6h with a 4-Cl group on the phenyl ring gave only 77% ee but 99% conversion in a shorter reaction time (2h) (entry 8). On the other hand, the substrates with an ortho-group on the phenyl ring gave substantially higher enantioselectivity and activity than those bearing a para-substituent. Thus, the substrate 4b bearing a methyl group on the ortho-position was reduced in 94% ee rapidly (entry 2), in contrast to 86% ee with its para-substituted analogue (entry 5). The reduction of 1-acetonaphthone and 2-acetonaphthone was also performed, and both of them gave high conversions and good enantioselectivities (entries 10 and 11). In particular, the best performance (99% conversion and 95% ee) was obtained in the reduction of 1-acetonaphthone (entry 10). The reduction of linear aromatic alkyl ketones 6l–m proceeded smoothly to give the corresponding chiral alcohols with good enantioselectivity (88% ee) (entries 12–13). However, the reduction of aromatic ketones with a branched alkyl group such as an isopropyl tended to give lower conversion and enantioselectivity with a longer reaction time (entry 14)."
4,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we have prepared a new family of chiral amino alcohol ligands from commercially available and inexpensive (S)-α-phenylethylamine through a one-step transformation. These amino alcohols have been successfully employed in the Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of various aromatic alkyl ketones, providing optically active secondary alcohol with 71–100% conversions and 67–95% ee. Ligand-screening disclosed that less sterically demanding ligand 4a tended to give higher enantioselectivity Furthermore, in comparison with the traditionally used 1,2-amino alcohol ligands in the Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, these newly developed amino alcohols had a 1,4-amino alcohol structural feature. Further application of these new amino alcohols in asymmetric synthesis is in progress."

6,General,"4.1 General All reactions were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere. All solvents were purified by a standard procedure, and commercially obtained reagents were used without further purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400MHz spectrometer in chloroform-d 1. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm with the internal TMS signal at 0.0ppm as a standard. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 100MHz spectrometer in chloroform-d 1. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm with the internal chloroform signal at 77.0ppm as a standard. GC analyses were performed on a HP4890D equipped with a chiral column (Supelco Astec Chiral Dex™ G-TA column, 30m×0.25mm×0.12μm, HP-Chiral column or a Supelco β-DEX 120 column, 30m×0.25mm×0.12μm) using hydrogen and nitrogen as the carrier gas, respectively. HPLC analyses were performed on an Agilent 1100 series instrument with a chiral column (Chiralcel OJ-H) with hexanes and 2-propanol as solvents. Optical rotations were recorded on a Jasco P-1020 polarimeter. The absolute configurations of the known products were determined by comparing the specific rotation with the reported data."

The resulting solution was stirred at −35°C for 30min, and then 7.0mL (55.0mmol, 1.1equiv) of Me3SiCl was added slowly at the same temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1h and then 60mL (150mmol, 3equiv) of a 2.5M solution of n-BuLi was added dropwise. After the addition was completed, the reaction mixture was stirred at −35°C for 4h. The reaction mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was cooled to −35°C again, and an appropriate carbonyl compound (55mmol, 1.1equiv) was added slowly over 0.5h. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 3h at the same temperature, and then warmed to room temperature. After stirring for another 10h, a solution of 1M aqueous HCl was added slowly until the reaction mixture became clear in both phases. The aqueous phase was extracted with ether (3×50mL). Combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/acetate/triethylamine, 4/1/0.4) to give the targeted amino alcohols 4a–d and recover the unreacted (S)-1-phenylethylamine 5. 4.2.1 {2-[(S)-1-Aminoethyl]phenyl}methanol 4a Prepared as a white solid from paraformaldehyde in 16.1% yield.
