0,Introduction,"Energy consumption around the globe is on the rise due to the exponential population growth and urbanization. Most of the energy currently used is produced from non-renewable fossil fuels. This has not only decreased the reserves of fossil fuels, mainly crude oil, but has also produced severe environmental contamination. Therefore, there is a need for alternative and non-conventional energy sources, with high energy efficiency and which would produce less environmental pollution. In this sense, intense research efforts are being made to develop alternative renewable energy sources [1,2]. It is expected that in the near future, hydrogen will be used, to a large extent, as a secondary energy carrier for the production of electricity for mobile and small-to-medium scale stationary applications [3]. Hydrogen can be used in fuel cells to produce electricity very efficiently and cleanly, since the only by-product is water. Additionally, hydrogen is utilized in many processes in the chemical, food, metallurgical, and pharmaceutical industries and it is also a valuable reactant in many reactions (e.g. refineries). Non-renewable resources have been the major feedstock for H2 production for many years. At present, ~50% of H2 is produced via catalytic steam reforming of natural gas followed by various down-stream purification steps to produce ~99.99% H2, this process being highly energy demanding. Therefore in order to support a sustainable hydrogen economy, it is crucial to produce hydrogen from renewable resources [2]. The catalytic steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) has been considered as an alternative to traditional methods due to the fact that bio-alcohols are easy to reform at low temperatures with high hydrogen selectivity, thus improving energy consumption and environmental performance. However, this process implicates many reaction intermediates and unstable products, especially at low temperatures [4]. The metal active sites play an important role in the activation and breaking of C-C and C-H bonds in the ethanol molecule [5]. Many noble metal-based catalysts have been tested in SRE under different reaction conditions [4–6]. These catalysts are promising due to their low selectivity to the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Rh based materials have been reported as active and selective catalysts in the SRE reaction at low temperatures [6,7]. However due to their high cost, noble metals are not so widely chosen for industrial applications. Therefore, many researchers are presently working on non-noble metal catalysts like Ni and Co due to their lower costs [8,9]. Although these metals are active and selective, they have severe deactivation problems [10] due to metal sintering and carbon deposition. Several authors studied catalysts based on Ni and Co supported on different oxides, such as SiO2, Al2O3 CeO2, MgO, CeO2, TiO2, ZrO2 and ZnO [11,12]. There is an agreement that the support could play an important role during the SRE reaction, especially at low temperatures. The use of basic supports was proposed to minimize carbon deposition under these conditions [9,13]. In a previous publication [6], we studied the effect of the La2O3 load in Rh (0.6%)/La2O3(X)-SiO2 catalysts on the catalytic properties for the ethanol steam reforming reaction. The catalyst with 15 wt/% of La2O3 was the most active, stable and selective to H2. On the other hand, in order to minimize the formation of carbonaceous deposits and improve the stability of the catalysts, Zhang et al. [14] studied the effect of the addition of La to Ni catalysts supported on Al2O3-SiO2. They reported that a low amount of lanthanum (5 wt%) was needed to constrain the crystal growth of nickel and promote the reduction of nickel oxide. Cerdá et al. [15] studied Co catalysts with different loads of metal (5, 10, 20 and 30 wt%) supported on Zn-hydrotalcite. They found that the addition of 1 wt% of lanthanum to the more active catalyst with 20 wt% of Co had positive effects on the catalytic stability. However, they suggested that a more detailed catalyst characterization is necessary before and after the reaction measurements using different lanthanum loads. On the other hand, Bueno and coworkers [16] using in situ XANES measurements as a function of temperature, studied the change in the oxidation states of Co supported on Al2O3, La2O3/Al2O3, CeO2/Al2O3 and CeO2/MgAl2O4. The authors claimed that the support could influence the degree of Co reduction and this, in turn, the carbon deposition. Noronha and coworkers [17] studied the effects of cobalt size on the catalytic performance in the steam reforming of ethanol using carbon nanofibers as a support. The authors calculated the fraction of cobalt surface atoms with coordination number of 4–7 (corner and edge atoms) and 8–11 (terrace atoms) as a function of the Co particle size. They concluded that by minimizing the fraction of terrace sites, through the optimization of the metal particle size, it is possible to decrease the deposition of amorphous carbon and increase the catalyst stability. With the aim to produce hydrogen with a high degree of purity, several authors studied the application of membrane reactors (MR) based on H2 selective membranes [18–22]. In these systems, both catalyst and membrane play an important role to achieve high ethanol conversion, hydrogen yield, and hydrogen recovery, being it necessary to study their joint effect in order to obtain a maximum MR efficiency and performance. Most of the studies reported in the literature were conducted using catalysts based on noble metals [19,22,23]. However, during the last decade some works have investigated the application of Co supported and structured catalysts in Pd based membrane reactors [19,24]. The scaling up of this technology should require the use of catalysts based on non-noble metals coupled to H2 selective membranes. In this work, we study how the Co loading in catalysts supported on a La-Si binary system affects performance in the ethanol steam reforming reaction in a conventional reactor. In order to identify the Co species and their influence on the catalytic activity, the solids were characterized by XRD, XPS, in situ Raman Spectroscopy and TEM. The best catalyst was used in a membrane reactor built with a commercial Pd-Ag membrane to study the performance of this stable and low-cost catalyst when is coupled with a high selective membrane."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Co catalysts supported on La2O3(15)-SiO2 were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation technique. SiO2 (Aerosil 200, calcined at 900 °C) was successively impregnated with La(NO3)3.6H2O and Co(NO3)2.6H2O as precursors. These precursors were dissolved in distilled water and the solution was added to the calcined SiO2 support. The lanthanum content in the support expressed by La2O3 weight percentage was equal to 15 wt% and the loading of Co was varied between 5, 10 and 15 wt%. The Co catalysts supported on La2O3(15)-SiO2 were denominated Co(5%), Co(10%) and Co(15%), respectively. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 80 °C overnight and they were later calcined at 550 °C for 6 h in air flow. The catalyst surface areas were 155, 137 and 128 m2g−1, respectively. The La2O3(15)-SiO2 support was used to check lanthanum re-dissolution during metal impregnation. The same amount of water was added to the calcined La2O3(15)-SiO2 support performing similar catalyst preparation steps. This sample was used as reference sample (La2O3(15)-SiO2R). The Co content of the prepared catalysts was measured through X-ray Fluorescence analyses employing a Shimadzu spectrometer, equipped with an energy dispersive system (Model EDX-720) with a high detection range (from Na11 to U92). In all catalysts, the Co contents were similar to the nominal values."
3,Catalytic tests,"2.2 Catalytic tests The catalytic tests were carried out at 500 °C and 100 kPa in a fixed-bed reactor using 20 and/or 136 mg of catalyst diluted in inert quartz (with a ratio 1:3) in order to avoid internal thermal gradients. The catalysts were heated up in Ar flow to the reaction temperature in 1 h and then they were reduced in pure hydrogen flow for 2 h, at the same temperature. The reactant mixture was fed in a pre-heater (220 °C) using a syringe pump, and the vaporized reaction mixture was fed to the reactor with Ar as the carrier gas (60 mL min−1). The mixture was prepared by weight, using anhydrous alcohol and deionized water. Two different contact times, defined as the weight of the catalyst divided by the total feed flow rate (W/F), were employed (3.3 × 10−2 and 4.9 × 10−3 g h L−1). The water/ethanol molar ratio (R) was equal to 5, with an ethanol molar content in the reactant flow of 2.0%. This ratio was taken from the energy efficiency study of the complete ethanol steam reforming process, including hydrogen purification and the PEM fuel cell, performed by Aguirre and co-workers. The authors concluded that the optimum value for the water to ethanol molar ratio is between 4 and 5 [25]. The membrane reactor was built with a palladium‑silver membrane with a diameter of 0.31 cm, provided by R&B Research and Consulting, and a catalyst bed (136 mg) diluted with quartz chips to obtain a bed height of 2.5 and 5.0 cm corresponding to a membrane area of 2.5 cm2 and 5.0 cm2, respectively. The hydrogen selectivity of the membrane was equal to 100%. A sweep gas flow was employed to increase the driving force for H2 permeation. More details were given in a previous work [23]. The feed and product streams were analyzed on-line with a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector and a 10 m long HayesepD® packed column. All pipes and valves were maintained at 200 °C in order to avoid reactant and product condensation. The absence of a homogeneous reaction was verified at 500 °C. The reaction temperature was chosen looking for a compromise between the kinetics of the reaction and the stability of the Pd-Ag membrane. The catalytic performance was analyzed through ethanol conversion (Xethanol), product distribution, H2 yield (RH2) and H2 recovery for the membrane reactor. (1) X Ethanol = 100 ∙ F Ethanol int − F Ethanol out F Ethanol int (2) W F = m c F T 0 (3) R H 2 = F H 2 F Ethanol int (4) H 2 recovery % = H 2 permeated H 2 produced x 100 where Fin ethanol and Fout ethanol are the molar flow of ethanol at the reactor inlet and outlet, respectively; mc is the catalyst mass and Fo T is the total flow [mL min−1] in the inlet (including Ar); RH2 is the hydrogen yield and FH2 is molar flow of hydrogen produced. It is important to note that the product distribution excludes water, ethanol and argon species from the calculations."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The XRD patterns of the calcined samples were acquired with an XD-D1 Shimadzu instrument, using Cu-Kα radiation in the scanning angle between 2θ = 10° and 70°. The scan rate was 1°min−1 at 30 kV and 40 mA. 2.3.2 Raman spectroscopy The Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRam spectrometer (Horiba–Jobin–Yvon) coupled to an Olympus confocal microscope (a 100× objective lens was used for simultaneous illumination and collection), equipped with a CCD detector cooled to about −70 o C using the Peltier effect. The excitation wavelength was in all cases 532 nm (diode-pumped solid-state laser). The laser power measured above the sample cell was 5 mW, with a collection time = 10 s and 10 accumulations. In situ Raman Spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Linkam high temperature cell. The catalyst (20 mg) was loaded in powder and the feed flowed through the samples. Subsequently, the catalysts were exposed to 5% H2/Ar flow at 25 °C; then, they were heated up until 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The Raman spectra were taken every 50 °C. 2.3.3 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) The reducibility of cobalt species was determined by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) using a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 unit equipped with a TCD detector. TPR profiles were obtained under a 5% H2/Ar gas stream, from room temperature to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Before the TPR tests, the catalysts were treated in situ at 600 °C for 30 min in an Argon flow. 2.3.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) A multi-technique system (SPECS) was employed to carry out XPS measurements. The analyses were performed on the reduced solids after treatment with H2 at 500 °C in a conventional fixed-bed reactor and at 400 °C in the reaction chamber attached to the spectrometer. All spectra were referenced to the C 1 s binding energy at 284.6 eV. The spectral regions corresponding to La 3d, C 1 s, O 1 s, Si 2 s and Co 2p core levels, were recorded for each sample. The data treatment was performed with the Casa XPS program (Casa Software Ltd., UK). The peak areas were determined by integration employing a Shirley-type background. Peaks were considered to be a mixture of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions in a 70/30 ratio. For the quantification of the elements, sensitivity factors provided by the manufacturer were used [6]. 2.3.5 Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) The catalysts, used during 25 h in the steam reforming of ethanol at 500 °C and a contact time of 4.9 × 10−3 g h L−1, were exposed to a mixture of 20% O2 in Ar at increased temperatures, from 20 to 800 °C, with a rate of 10 °C min−1. The gas flow rate was 30 mL min−1 and the reactor outlet was fed into a methanation reactor. The resultant stream was analyzed in an on-line FID detector (Shimadzu GC-8AChromatograph). 2.3.6 Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of carbon dioxide Prior to the TPD analyzes of the supports (SiO2 and La2O3 (15%)-SiO2), the samples were purged under Nitrogen flow (50 mL min-1) from room temperature up to 200 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The samples were then cooled to room temperature and reduced under flowing H2 (30 mL min−1) up to 500 °C (10 °C min−1) and then kept at this temperature for 2 h. After purging with N2 for 30 min, the flow was switched to CO2 for 30 min, next the samples was cooled to room temperature under CO2 flow, and after sweeping the lines for 1 h in N2 flow, the temperature was increased at 10 °C min−1 from 25 to 700 °C, keeping samples at this temperature to 1 h. The desorbed CO2 was monitored using the same analytical system used in the TPO experiences. 2.3.7 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) TEM specimens were dispersed onto a lacey carbon grid without ultrasonic dispersion. Selected area electron diffraction patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired using a Tecnai F20 G2 transmission electron microscope operated at room temperature and 200 kV. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of selected regions was used for determining the different phases present in the sample. The Digital Micrograph program was used for the analysis of diffraction patterns and images (Gatan Microscopy Suite®)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of calcined and reduced catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of calcined and reduced catalysts Based in the SRE results previously obtained for Rh catalysts [6], the La2O3(X)-SiO2 system with a La2O3 load equal to 15 wt% was employed as support for the Co catalysts. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1 ) exhibits a broad signal at 2θ =21.5° related to the amorphous SiO2. The broad shoulder at about 2θ =29° and a low-intensity reflection at 2θ =45° are symptomatic of the presence of amorphous lanthanum disilicate (La2Si2O7) since both features appear in the main peak region given for this compound (JCPDSNo.21–1014) [6]. The basicity of SiO2 and La2O3(15)-SiO2 support was studied by CO2-TPD measurements. For the La2O3(15)-SiO2 support, the TPD profile shows two signals at low temperature: a signal below 100 °C corresponding to physisorbed CO2 and another signal at 140 °C corresponding to weak adsorption sites. While the signal at high temperatures (625 °C) could be attributed to the decomposition of lanthanum oxycarbonate. Note that in the case of SiO2, no CO2 desorption was evidenced (Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material). These results indicated the presence of basic sites with different strength in the lanthanum based support. XRD patterns of the calcined and reduced catalysts are also shown in Fig. 1. In the calcined catalysts with higher Co load, reflections related to cobalt oxides were detected at 2θ = 31.29°, 36.94°, 44.97°, 55.91°, 59.32°, and 65.43°. These reflections correspond to the Co3O4 spinel structure (PDF 74–2120). The crystallite size was estimated from the reflection located at 2θ = 36.9° using Scherrer's equation, and values of 13 nm and 7 nm were obtained for the catalysts with 10 and 15 wt% Co loading, respectively. After the reduction in H2 flow, the reflections assigned to Co3O4 disappeared and peaks at 44.2o and 51.5o were observed which corresponded to metallic Co (JCPDSNo.15–806). Note that the catalyst with the lower Co load (5 wt%) showed only XRD peaks related to the support (Fig. 1). The Raman spectrum of the calcined Co(15%) catalyst (Fig. 2 ) reveals bands located at approximately 200, 484, 622, and 693 cm−1 that correspond to the F2g, Eg, F2g, and A1g modes, of the Co3O 4 phase, respectively [26]. Furthermore, the spectrum show not clearly defined bands centered at 263, 927 cm−1, and a broad band in the 400–700 cm−1 range. The spectrum corresponding to the calcined Co(5%) catalyst presents only the signal at 260 cm−1 and a broad band in the range of 400 to 700 cm−1 centered at 600 cm−1 (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Material). These results are consistent with those observed by XRD. Note that the La2O3(15)-SiO2R reference sample did not present Raman bands, suggesting that the support was not modified during cobalt impregnation by incipient wetness. A broad band in the range between 450 and 600 cm−1 was previously assigned to CoO [27,28]. However, the position of these bands differed from what we observed when Co is supported on the La2O3(15)-SiO2 binary system (Fig. S2). To identify the Co species, in situ reduction studies were carried out using a high temperature cell coupled to the Raman spectrometer. Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra for the Co(15%) catalyst measured at different temperatures when a H2/Ar mixture was fed to the cell. All Raman bands exhibit low intensity, the broad band between 400 and 700 cm−1 disappears at 300 °C, while the Co3O4 bands start to decrease at 350 °C and they disappear at 450 °C. This suggests that the low-intensity signals at 260 and 923 cm −1 and the broad band between 400 and 700 cm−1 are due to more reducible Co species or hydroxides like CoO(OH) and Co(OH)2, which are thermally unstable. Switzer and coworkers [29] characterized electrodeposited Co(OH)2 films by Raman Spectroscopy. They followed the transformation of Co(OH)2 to CoO(OH), assigning the band at 260 cm−1 to the Eg mode for Co(OH)2. This observation also supports that Co(OH)2 is the Co species detected in our catalysts since the band at 260 cm−1 is always present. On the other hand, when the Co(5%) catalyst was heated in flowing Ar, the broad signal completely disappeared at 500 °C (not shown). Note that no reflections were observed from crystalline Co hydroxides in the XRD pattern of Co(5%). Therefore, the broad Raman band between 400 and 700 cm−1 could be assigned to amorphous Co(OH)2 [29]. Fig. 3 shows the temperature-programmed reduction profiles for all catalysts. They show peaks of hydrogen consumption in the 200–500 °C temperature range attributed to the reduction of Co3O4 to Co0 and another peak at temperatures above 750 °C. Those cobalt species more difficult to reduce could be assigned to Co that strongly interacts with the support. When increasing the cobalt content, the intensities of low temperature peaks increase, indicating a higher fraction of easily reducible species, while in the high temperature region the hydrogen consumption decreases. Rodrigues and Bueno [30] studied the effect of the interaction of silica-supported CoOx catalysts obtained by changing the impregnation conditions and the calcination temperature. They reported that by employing a calcination temperature of 400 °C, different CoOx species can be formed, depending on the Co loading. The sample with a Co loading of 13 wt% showed CoOx species reducible at the low temperature (LT) region (<550 °C) and high temperature (HT) region (>550 °C). The TPR profiles at temperatures <550 °C showed peaks characteristic of the reduction of Co3O4-like particles in two steps (Co3O4 → CoO → Co), while peaks at the HT region were assigned to the presence of cobalt hydroxysilicate-like species or of surface cobalt silicate species. In addition, for the sample with the lowest Co loading (8.6 wt%), the main Co species were reduced at temperatures higher than 550 °C. From these results, the authors concluded that a low Co loading favored a high interaction between CoOx species and silica. In addition, Ernst et al. [31] reached similar results studying Co/SiO2 catalysts with higher metal loadings (between 20 and 64 wt%). For our Co catalysts supported on the La2O3(15)-SiO2 binary system, we found results comparable to those previously described by Rodriguez and Bueno [30]. The low Co loading catalysts presented a lower fraction of easily reducible Co species. The surface properties of the calcined and reduced catalysts were studied by XPS. The calcined catalysts were reduced ex-situ at 500 °C, followed by a treatment in the load-lock chamber of the spectrometer at 400 °C in flowing hydrogen. Fig. 4 shows the Co 2p spectra of the calcined (A) and reduced (B) solids. As observed, the Co 2p spectra of the calcined catalysts show different shapes depending on the cobalt load. For the Co(5%) solid, a peak located at 781.6 eV can be observed, which could be related to Co oxidized species. Additionally, a broad satellite peak at higher binding energy (785.9 eV) can be seen. The satellite to the Co 2p3/2 main peak intensity ratio (ISAT/IPP) for this sample was 0.91. As it has been reported, the Co+2 and Co+3 species show Co 2p peaks with similar binding energies [32]. However, Co+2 show a clearly defined shake-up satellite located at ~6 eV from the main peak with a ISAT/IPP of about 0.9 [33]. This feature indicates that cobalt is mainly like Co+2 at the surface of the Co(5%) catalyst. On the other hand, the catalyst with a higher Co loading presents a Co 2p3/2 peak at 780.9 eV and a shake-up satellite with very low intensity (ISAT/IPP = 0.54). These features are similar to those reported for Co3O4. The La 3d spectra (not shown) were similar to those previously reported for the La2O3(15)-SiO2 support [6]. They presented a main peak located at 835.4 ± 0.1 eV with a 3d5/2-3d3/2 spin-orbital splitting of 16.5 ± 0.3 eV and a shake-up satellite located at 3.5 ± 0.1 eV from the main peak. For the O1s region, the Co/La2O3(15)-SiO2 catalysts showed two contributions: one peak located at 532.1 ± 0.1 eV, related to the SiO2 support, and a shoulder at lower binding energies (529.9 ± 0.1 eV) which could be assigned to CoOx species. The surface properties of the catalysts after calcination and reduction are summarized in Table 1 . For the reduced solids, two peaks were observed in the Co 2p3/2 region, one located at a binding energy of 778.1 ± 0.1 eV, assigned to Co0, and the second at 781.5 ± 0.3 eV, related to Co+n species. Besides, the shake-up satellite was detected with different proportion between the samples. The surface metallic cobalt/total cobalt atomic ratio (Co0/CoT) was equal to 0.12 for the Co(5%) and Co(10%) solids; and for the Co(15%) catalyst, the Co0/CoT ratio was 0.2 (Table 1), in agreement with the higher reducibility observed in the TPR results. Note that the ISAT/IPP ratio for the reduced Co(5%) and Co(10%) samples was 0.92 and 0.94, respectively, suggesting that Co appears mainly as Co+2 at the surface. However, for the reduced Co(15%) catalyst, the ISAT/IPP ratio increased from 0.48 to 0.80, indicating that the Co3O4 species present in the calcined solid were reduced to Co+2 and Co0 surface species. Fig. 5 shows TEM images of the reduced catalyst with a different Co loading, 5 wt% and 15 wt. A careful local phase composition analysis of the HRTEM images and electron diffraction patterns reveals that cobalt is present as Co0 and CoO or Co3O4 oxides [34]. For the case of Co(5%), the higher contribution corresponds to Co(OH)2 with a minor proportion of metallic cobalt [35]. In this catalyst, crystalline nanoparticles of about 6 nm were detected, easily observed in the inset. The FFT of the particle in the inset shows the (001) reflection of Co(OH)2. The catalyst with a 15 wt% of Co presents a more uniform distribution of Co species over the support. The regions of the image with a darker contrast correspond to a higher degree of coverage by crystalline nanoparticles. In the FFT are shown the spacing's corresponding to (002,101) reflections of Co. Reflections with spacing's close to these ones can be distinguished and measured for identification of the different phases. These results are in agreement with the TPR and XPS data, in which a higher reducibility was observed for the catalyst with higher Co loading (15 wt% Co)."
7,Catalyst evaluation in a conventional reactor,"3.2 Catalyst evaluation in a conventional reactor Fig. 6 shows the ethanol conversion as a function of time on stream during SER using Co catalysts with a W/F = 4.9 × 10−3 g h L−1. All catalysts showed a similar behavior of the ethanol conversion. In the first reaction hour, the conversion was close to 100% and a slight deactivation was observed, reaching values of 60–70% after 25 h on stream. On the other hand, all catalysts showed the presence of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane and also acetaldehyde formation. However, there was no ethylene formation. The catalyst with the lower metal load presented a different product distribution in comparison with the other catalysts studied in this work. Co(5%) was more selective to the acetaldehyde formation (Fig. 7A) during all the time on stream. The high proportion of acetaldehyde in the product stream suggested that this catalyst was active for the ethanol dehydrogenation reaction, presenting low formation of other secondary products (CO, CO2 and CH4). On the other hand, the catalysts with higher cobalt load (10 and 15 wt%) were more selective to H2 production (Figs. 7B and C). Therefore, it could be inferred that with the increase of cobalt content, the catalysts are more selective to hydrogen production. This is evidenced by the increase in the CO and CO2 proportion and the decrease in acetaldehyde. According to what is said above and to what was reported for catalysts based on cobalt [17,36], it can be proposed that the reforming reaction would be given via the dehydrogenation reaction of ethanol to acetaldehyde and hydrogen. In this sense, Cerdá et al. [15] studied Co catalysts supported on a Zn hydrotalcite. The authors found that due to the combination of small Co crystals and a high degree of reduction of the solids with a higher Co loading (20 and 30 wt%), the solids presented higher hydrogen selectivity compared to the catalysts with 5 and 10 wt% cobalt. Greluk et al. [37] also suggested that the performance of Co catalysts supported on CeO2 in the SRE at 500 °C depends on cobalt content and cobalt crystallites size. The catalyst stability is probably the most important issue during ethanol steam reforming for hydrogen production. Most authors in the literature report that carbon formation is the main cause of catalyst deactivation, and that carbon deposition depends on the reaction conditions, the active metal, the crystallite/particle size and the support employed [6,38]. 3.2.1 Effect of contact time (W/F) Most of the literature reports employing Co catalysts for the steam reforming of ethanol carried out stability tests during almost 25 h at low space velocity [17,36,39–41]. In order to improve catalyst stability and H2 production, the W/F was increased from 4.9 10−3 g h L−1 to 3.3 10−2 g h L−1 employing only the catalysts with higher and lower load of Co (5 and 15%). Under these conditions, Fig. 8A and B show the ethanol conversion as a function of the reaction time. Both catalysts presented a similar activity during the first hours of reaction. However, the Co(5%) catalyst exhibited a slight deactivation after 5 h on stream reaching a conversion of 96% after 24 h (Fig. 8A). In the case of the catalytic measurements with lower contact time, the most significant difference between both catalysts was observed in the product distribution (Fig. 8A y B). When the contact time increased, the acetaldehyde decomposition, water gas shift and steam methane reforming reactions were favored. The Co(5%) catalyst produced between 20 and 30% of acetaldehyde in dry basis and a CO2 formation similar to CO (Fig. 8 A), while for the Co(15%) catalyst, an increase of the selectivity to H2 with respect to the test with lower contact time can be noticed. This catalyst did not present acetaldehyde formation showing a hydrogen composition of 74% (Fig. 8 B). Note that in this solid the CO2 formation was higher than that of CO. These results were close to those predicted by the thermodynamic equilibrium reported in our previous work [6], using the same reaction conditions. Note that the catalyst with lower Co loading showed low H2 selectivity and deactivation under reaction conditions (Fig. 8A). Therefore, it could be inferred that with the presence of a high cobalt content, the catalyst became more active for the breaking of the C-C and C-H bonds producing hydrogen and C1 compounds, which led to an improvement in the reforming activity of the catalysts. The increase in the contact time produced a change in the selectivity improving the hydrogen yield from 0.5 to 1.2 and from 1.7 to 3.4 for Co(5%) and Co(15%), respectively (Fig. 8 C). With the increase of Co content (active sites) and contact time, the decomposition of acetaldehyde to methane and CO and other reactions such as methane reforming and water gas shift would be favored, thus increasing the production of H2 and CO2. Llorca and coworkers [42,43] studied the effect of the contact time using Co3[Si2O5]2(OH)2 as catalyst in the ethanol reforming reaction, the authors determined a higher CO production in the case of lower contact time, in agreement with our observations."
8,Characterization of used catalysts,"3.3 Characterization of used catalysts To study the catalysts after reaction, HRTEM, Raman Spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation measurements were performed on the catalysts used in reaction during 24 h at 500 °C, with a water/ethanol molar ratio of 5 and W/F = 4.9 10−3 or 3.3 10−2 g h L−1. The cobalt species present in the catalysts after reaction and the formation of carbonaceous deposits were studied by HRTEM. Fig. 9 A shows one image of the Co(5%) catalyst from which we can observe the formation of multiwall carbon nanotubes. The Co nanoparticles of about 7 nm could be responsible for the formation and growth of the nanotubes, detaching from the support during nanotube growth. The Co encapsulation (see inset) with carbon explains the lower selectivity of the catalyst to hydrogen production and the stability for ethanol conversion. In the case of the sample with higher Co loading (see Fig. 9 B), we can observe the formation of bigger crystalline particles of about 30 nm and the formation of disordered graphitic carbon material which both covers the support and encapsulates the Co containing nanoparticles without modifying the electronic environment, thus allowing a constant hydrogen yield during the time on stream. In the Raman spectra (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Material) of the used catalysts, only the signals corresponding to the carbon species were detected [44,45]. However, in the catalyst with 15 wt% of Co used with longer contact time, a weak signal appears at 680 cm −1 which can be assigned to the Co3O4 spinel. Fig. 10 shows the TPO oxidation profiles for the Co(5%) and Co(15%) catalysts after being used in the steam reforming of ethanol. For both catalysts, two peaks are observed, indicating the contribution of at least two carbonaceous species. In the case of the Co(15%) catalyst, the burning of the carbonaceous deposits begins at around 300 °C, presenting two signals at 450 and 560 °C, completing the oxidation at 650 °C. After the TPO measurement, no carbonaceous deposits were detected by Raman spectroscopy. For the Co(5%) catalyst, the carbon oxidation begins at about 400 °C. In this case the TPO profile presents two peaks, the first centered at 465 °C while the low intensity (shoulder) peak is centered at 550 °C. The carbonaceous deposits removed at lower temperatures could be responsible for the deactivation of the catalysts. It has been reported [46] that the TPO peaks at low temperature (<450 °C) correspond to the combustion of amorphous carbon, which is activated by the metal site in contact with the carbonaceous deposit. Nevertheless, the oxidation of filamentous carbon could occur above 450 °C, and the higher temperature peaks correspond to the combustion of carbon deposits with different graphitization degrees. The HRTEM results are in agreement with the TPO data, where the occurrence of two oxidation peaks suggests the formation of carbon deposits with a different chemical environment. From the TPO measurements, it was also possible to quantify the amount of carbon deposited; 1.29 10−4 and 1.39 10−3 g carbon g cat−1 h−1 were formed for the Co(5%) and Co(15%) catalysts, respectively. These values are lower than those reported in the literature for other cobalt catalysts [41,47]. On the other hand, Palma et al. using Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2-SiO2 in the oxidative steam reforming of ethanol reaction, studied the dependence of the formation of carbon with the size of Ni crystallites. The authors determined that the catalysts with the smallest particle size presented less carbon deposition [48]. Our catalyst with the low Co loading and smallest particle size (Co 5%) showed lower stability and H2 selectivity and also less carbon formation. However, according to the TPO results, the higher proportion of amorphous carbon would block the active sites, influencing the stability and selectivity under reaction conditions. Note that in the literature, the ethanol steam reforming reaction is usually studied operating at higher reaction temperatures and higher water/ethanol ratios, conditions in which carbon formation would be more disadvantaged. Table 2 summarizes the carbon formation results for several Co-based catalysts supported in different oxides. The temperature employed in those studies varied over 400 and 550 °C and the water/ethanol ratio between 3 and 12. Note that the catalysts studied in this work presented carbon formation of the same order in comparison with other materials evaluated in more favorable conditions, high water/ethanol ratios [37,41,49]. Furthermore, the surface properties of the catalysts after reaction at 500 °C were studied through XPS without previous treatment in the load lock chamber of the spectrometer. Table 3 shows the data obtained for the solids after reaction at 500 °C, R = 5, and two different W/F. The Co 2p region of the Co(5%) solid after 24 h of reaction shows two main contributions, one assigned to Co0 at 777.4 eV and the second one to Co2+ at 781.4 eV, and the shake-up satellite exhibits a ISAT/IPP ratio equal to 0.96. Comparing with the reduced sample, the used catalyst shows a lower proportion of Co0 determined by XPS, decreasing from 12% to 5% (Tables 1 and 3). As seen from the data summarized in Table 3, the O530/O532 ratio increased from 0.09 to 0.11 and the ISAT/IPP ratio increased from 0.92 up to 0.96, respectively, while the surface Co/La ratio decreased from 1.15 to 0.99. Varga et al. [47] reported that Co+2 species have activity towards the ethanol dehydrogenation reaction and that the Co0 species are responsible for the occurrence of the reforming reactions. This could explain the low production of secondary products as well as the high proportion of acetaldehyde in the Co(5%) catalyst which mainly presented Co+2 species with very low reduction degree. The XPS spectra of the Co(15%) solid after being used employing different contact times, did not show significant differences. In both cases, the Co 2p3/2 region showed signals at 778.1 ± 0.1 and 780.9 ± 0.1 eV, with a shake-up satellite at 784.0 ± 0.3 eV. The ISAT/IPP ratio was 0.87 and 1.02, for the used catalyst with lower and higher contact time, respectively. These data could indicate that the surface species on the used catalyst are Co0 and Co2+. The Co0 proportion decreased from 20 to 14.9% after reaction; however, the surface Co0 is still higher than in the used Co(5%) solid (Table 2). The XPS results are in agreement with previous reports [15] about the relation between the activity for the steam reforming of ethanol and the presence of Co0 and Co+2 species on the catalyst surface [47]. Llorca and coworkers [52] studied by means of in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, catalysts based on Cobalt–silica aerogel coatings. The authors reported the presence of metallic Co in the catalysts evaluated in the SRE reaction at 375 and 450 °C. They argue that the Co+2 species would participate in the ethanol dehydrogenation reaction into acetaldehyde and hydrogen, while metallic species would catalyze the reforming reaction of acetaldehyde to H2 and CO2. In this sense, Bayram et al. [53] also studied the variation of the cobalt oxidation states on Co/CeO2 catalysts during steam reforming of ethanol, using different in situ characterization techniques. The authors determined that at 500 °C, in the case of the calcined catalyst, the reforming reaction begins to be favored by the presence of Co+2 and Coo species obtained from the reduction in reaction conditions of the Co3O4 species. On the other hand, for the reduced catalyst, part of the metallic Co would be oxidized to Co+2. This would further indicates the importance of having a balance between Co0 and Co2+ species in order to favor the activity and stability of the catalysts. For the Co(15%) catalyst, the Co/La and O530/O532 surface ratio were 1.28 and 0.18 in the reduced solid (Table 1) and decreased to 0.9 and 0.07 in the used one (Table 3). This decrease could be due to the preferential deposition of small amounts of carbon on the surface of the Co species. The C 1 s peak at 283.6 eV was assigned to the carbon deposited during reaction [54]. The surface C283/La intensity ratio was equal to 51 for the high Co loading catalyst used at two different W/F. After being exposed at W/F = 4.9 10−3 g h L−1 the low loading catalyst showed a slightly lower amount of surface carbon (C283/La = 44). This result would be in agreement with the TPO data where the catalyst with lower Co content and small particle size exhibits a lower amount of carbon deposited."
9,Catalyst evaluation in a membrane reactor,"3.4 Catalyst evaluation in a membrane reactor Both catalyst and membrane play an important role to achieve high MR performance in terms of ethanol conversion, H2 yield and recovery. In this work, we reported that the catalyst with the highest Co content presented high stability and hydrogen selectivity with low carbon deposition. Therefore, the Co(15%) catalyst was a good candidate to be evaluated in a membrane reactor built with a well-known and highly selective commercial membrane. The effect of the sweep gas ratio (Ar flow/Ethanol flow fed) and the membrane permeation area on the hydrogen recovery and H2 yield is shown in Fig. 11 . In all cases, the conversion of ethanol was 100%. It is observed that for the different permeation areas, the hydrogen recovery increased with the sweep gas ratio, reaching 54% when the permeation area was equal to 6.2 cm2. The effect of the sweep gas was related to the increase of the driving force between both sides of the membrane. This increase produced a better selectivity towards CO2 and CO and decreased that of CH4, due to H2 separation, which favored WGS and methane reforming, producing a change in the distribution of products in the reaction side (Fig. 12 ). Therefore, the total hydrogen production slightly increased in comparison with the value obtained in the conventional reactor. The hydrogen yield increases from 3.2 to 3.65 (15%), due to the water-gas shift reaction could be favored by removing H2 from the reaction side. Table 2 also shows the carbon formation under the conditions imposed by the membrane reactor. Note that when H2 is extracted from the reaction zone, the atmosphere is less reducing (Fig. 12) and could increase the carbon deposition. However, in this case, the amount of carbon deposited was in the same order as that observed on the catalyst evaluated in the conventional reactor. Besides, the membrane stability was verified through selectivity and H2 permeation measurements. The obtained results suggested that the carbon formation did not affect the life-time of the commercial membrane after being used in the membrane reactor. In recent years, several studies of the ethanol steam reforming have used different types of membranes and catalysts [19,20]. Some of them focused on theoretical studies [55–57] while others used relatively high water/ethanol ratio. Due to the different experimental conditions employed (temperature, pressure, driving force, permeation area, and catalysts), it is only possible to compare some trends related to the operation of membrane reactors for the production of H2. Some reports analyzed the effect of pressure on H2 permeation performing theoretical and experimental studies in membrane reactors. [58–63]. Papadias et al. [58] through a theoretical study of the steam reforming of ethanol reaction indicated that at high pressures, the hydrogen production is inhibited. However, they concluded that for the process to be efficient to high pressures, it is necessary to operate at relatively high temperatures (750 °C) using high permeation membranes. Llorca and coworkers through different experiments studied a cobalt hydrotalcite structured catalyst coupled with a composite Pd-Ag membrane operating at high pressures (7 to 18 bars) and a wide temperature range (350–600 °C). Under these conditions, they reported that operating at 500 °C and 12 bar a decrease in H2 yield compared to the system evaluated at a lower pressure was observed [24,60]. Goldbach and coworkers [62] studied the H2 production using and Ir/CeO2 catalyst in a Pd membrane reactor. The authors concluded that at temperatures lower than 500 °C, the partial pressures of H2 in the reaction side were relatively low. Therefore, under these conditions, they reported that a driving force for hydrogen permeation must be established by using sweep gas flow, avoiding the negative effect of pressure on hydrogen yield. In addition, these authors claimed that an excess of steam decreased the H2 partial pressure and increased the external mass transfer resistance on the reaction side, reducing the H2 separation efficiency. To obtain a high-performance membrane reactor system, it is important to have a highly hydrogen perm-selective membrane coupled with an active, selective and stable catalyst. In the present work, we analyzed a low-cost Co based-catalyst, which showed high activity, hydrogen selectivity, and stability under the reaction conditions. The catalyst was packed in contact with a commercial Pd-Ag membrane with 100% H2 selectivity, operating at 500 °C and 1 bar. This catalyst present low carbon deposition that did not affect the properties of the membrane. In this condition it was possible to obtain a H2 recovery comparable to those reported in the literature (54%) working at higher pressures between 6 and 8 bar. However, using a thinner membrane could also increase the hydrogen yield and hydrogen recovery."
10,Conclusions,"Co catalysts supported on La2O3(15)-SiO2 with different metal content and particle sizes were tested in the ethanol steam reforming reaction for hydrogen production. When increasing the cobalt content, a higher fraction of easily reducible species was observed from TPR and XPS results. It was observed that the higher Co0 species content increased the activity of the catalyst towards the hydrogen producing reactions, with a significant increase in hydrogen yield. This suggests that the cobalt metal species could be the active species for most of the hydrogen producing reactions that occur in ethanol reforming. In the solid with lower Co loading the formation of nanotubes produced a slight decrease in ethanol conversion and a change in selectivity. On the other hand, in the catalyst with higher cobalt content the carbonaceous deposits were of the amorphous type and did not modify the electronic environment, which allowed maintaining both the ethanol conversion and also the hydrogen yield constant over time on stream. The Co(15%) catalyst that presented the best catalytic properties with low carbon deposition was evaluated in a membrane reactor. Operating at 500 °C with a permeation area of 6.2 cm2, it was possible to obtain a hydrogen recovery comparable to the values reported in the literature. The use of the membrane reactor built with a highly selective membrane allowed to obtain a CO-free hydrogen stream."
