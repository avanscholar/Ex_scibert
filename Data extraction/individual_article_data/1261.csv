0,Introduction,"In the last decades in connection with the depletion of natural reserves of hydrocarbon raw materials, the need to implement intensive technologies and solve environmental problems, the urgency of the problem of a more complete and effective chemical processing of oil and gas components sharply increases. High importance is the searches for fundamentally new ways of involving hydrocarbons in chemical transformations. There is growing interest in new catalytic systems capable of efficiently and selectively functionalizing alkanes under mild conditions. The study of the mechanisms of oxidation reactions is of great importance for finding the most affordable and economical catalysts in order to obtain the compounds we need from hydrocarbon feedstocks. Such mechanisms may include the formation of free radicals, for example, hydroxyl radicals [1]. Certain complexes of transition [2–21] and non-transition metals [22–29] are known to catalyze reactions of hydrocarbons and alcohols occurring with functionalization of CH bonds. Hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides are often used as oxidants in these processes. All these reactions lead to the production of extremely valuable chemical substances. New catalytic systems based on metal complexes have been discovered, which allow us to introduce various groups into aromatic and saturated hydrocarbons, as well as other CH compounds (see, for example [30–33], and oxidize alcohols into aldehydes, ketones and acids. The selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes and ketones has become an important study due to the widespread use of these products in organic synthesis. Copper complexes have found high activity in these oxidation processes. Copper derivatives bearing various nitrogen-containing ligands are among the most active catalysts [34–40]. Recently, we have found a few copper complexes exhibited high efficiency in oxidation of organic compound with peroxides [41–52]. In the present publication we describe a new method for the synthesis of copper complexes containing N-ligands and oxidations of some organic compounds catalyzed with these complexes."

A mixture of Cu(OAc)2*H2O (30 mg, 0.15 mmol) and 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (32 mg, 0.15 mmol) was heated in 3 mL of ethanol at 50 °C until the dissolution of solid material.

4,The structure of complex 5,"2.3 The structure of complex 5 Crystals of 5 were grown by a gas-phase diffusion of the diethyl ether in acetic acid solution of 5. Crystals of 5 (C25H21CuN3O6S) are triclinic, space group P-1, at 120 K: a = 9.2356(14) Å, b = 10.6358(14) Å, c = 13.3800(19) Å, α = 68.175(3)°, β = 85.416(3)°, γ = 76.287(2)°, V = 1185.3(3) Å3, Z = 2 (Z’ = 1), d calc = 1.555 g cm − 3, μ(MoKα) = 10.57 cm−1, F(000) = 570. Intensities of 11,742 reflections were measured with a Bruker APEX2 DUO CCD diffractometer [λ(MoKα) = 0.71073 Å, ω-scans, 2θ < 52°], and 4673 independent reflections [Rint = 0.0808] were used in further refinement. Using Olex2 [57], the structure was solved with the ShelXT structure solution program [58] using Intrinsic Phasing and refined with the XL refinement package [59] using Least-Squares minimization. Hydrogen atom of OH group of the solvent molecule was located from difference Fourier synthesis while positions of other hydrogen atoms were calculated. All hydrogen atoms were refined in the isotropic approximation within the riding model. The refinement converged to wR2 = 0.1660 and GOF = 1.061 for all the independent reflections (R1 = 0.0684 was calculated against F for 3040 observed reflections with I > 2σ(I)). CCDC 1,979,320 contains the supplementary crystallographic information for 5. See Fig. 1 ."
5,Oxidation of alkanes,"2.4 Oxidation of alkanes The oxidation reactions were typically carried out in air in thermostated Pyrex cylindrical vessels with vigorous stirring; total volume of the reaction solution was 5 mL (CAUTION: the combination of air or molecular oxygen and H2O2 with organic compounds at elevated temperatures may be explosive!). Initially, a portion of 50% aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide was added to the solution of the catalyst and substrate in acetonitrile. The reaction solutions were analysed by GC (the instrument 3700, fused silica capillary column FFAP/OV-101 20/80 w/w, 30 m × 0.2 mm × 0.3 µm; helium as a carrier gas. Attribution of peaks was made by comparison with chromatograms of authentic samples.). Usually samples were analyzed twice, i.e. before and after the addition of the excess of solid PPh3 (see. below Fig. 2 in Section 3.3) This method was developed and used previously by Shul’pin [60–67]. Alkyl hydroperoxides are transformed in the GC injector into a mixture of the corresponding ketone and alcohol. Due to this we quantitatively reduced the reaction samples with PPh3 to obtain the corresponding alcohol. This method allows us to calculate the real concentrations not only of the hydroperoxide but of the alcohols and ketones present in the solution at a given moment."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis of complexes 1–9,3.1 Synthesis of complexes 1–9 Phenanthroline complexes 1–4 and 6 were synthesized according to the general method which involve interaction of copper(II) halides with phenanthrolines in ethanol solution. If two equivalents of a ligand used bis-phenanthroline complexes could be obtained. In that case one halogen atom still coordinates to copper. When three equivalents of phenanthroline used reaction proceeds with the formation of tris-phenanthroline complex due to the substitution of coordinated halide ions by nitrogen contained ligand. Interaction of dmphen with copper(II) acetate followed by addition of HQSA to the reaction mixture affords new mixed ligand complex 5. Bis-phenanthroline copper(I) complexes 8 and 9 were synthesized by a simple one pot method based on interaction of copper(II) nitrate with phenanthrolines in presence of ascorbic acid as reductant.
8,The structure of complex 5,"3.2 The structure of complex 5 The single crystal of complex 5 suitable for X-ray diffraction study was grown by a slow gas-phase diffusion of the diethyl ether in acetic acid solution of complex. The chemical structure is shown on Fig. 1. Copper (II) atom binds both dmphen and HQSA ligands forming a distorted square-pyramidal structure. 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid acts as a dibasic tridentate ligand, and coordinates to copper through the nitrogen and two deprotonated oxygen atoms. Dmphen and HQSA are essentially planar and planes of aromatic ligands are almost orthogonal forming an angle 79.4°. The distance Cu1–O4 (1.998 Å) with phenolate oxygen atom is less than Cu1–O1 (2.097 Å) with sulfonate oxygen, moreover, complex crystallises with one molecule of acetic acid with a hydrogen bond with phenolate oxygen of oxyquinoline ligand which is in agreement with a better electron-donating properties of phenolate oxygen if compared with sulfonate oxygen."
9,Oxidation of alkanes with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by compounds 1–9,"3.3 Oxidation of alkanes with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by compounds 1–9 Copper derivatives are known to efficiently catalyze the oxidation of hydrocarbons and alcohols with peroxides [34–41]. Alkyl hydroperoxides, alcohols and ketones (aldehydes) are the main products in such reactions. In the present work, we have found that specially synthesized compounds 1–9 (see scheme1) catalyze the oxidation of alkanes with H2O2 in acetonitrile. We investigated oxidations of alkanes at various low temperatures (40–60 °C). The reactions in the presence of the most active Complex 1 were studied in more detail. Complex 1 turned out to be the most active and stable, in comparison with other compounds studied here. For example, complex 1 leads to the formation of oxidation products with a yield of 27% and TON = 250. Parameters for other catalysts are given in the captions in Figs. 7–14 . For example, catalyst 9 leads to the formation of oxidation products with the yield of only 2.5% and TON = 22 (see Fig. 14). The results of our investigations of some oxidation reactions catalyzed by Complexes 1–9 under various low temperatures 40–60 °C are summarized in Figs. 2–14. The kinetic curve of the formation of the cyclohexane oxygenation product obtained at 40° C (see Fig. 3) has an accelerating character, i.e. the reaction rate increases as it proceeds. This indicates that during the reaction a catalytically more active form of the catalyst is formed than the initial one. The formation of the active form of the catalyst accelerates with increasing temperature and at 60° C the kinetic curve does not show an accelerating character. The observed decrease in the yield of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, after reaching its maximum concentration, indicates its decomposition either thermal or under the influence of a catalyst. A decrease in the yield of the alkane oxidation product upon the introduction of phenanthroline into the solution (see Figs. 3 and 4) means that the most active complexes in the catalysis are copper compounds containing a smaller number of phenanthroline molecules in the coordination sphere, probably the most active compounds contain one phenanthroline molecule per copper atom. Therefore, the accelerating nature of the kinetic curve in Fig. 3 can be logically associated with the loss of the phenanthroline molecule by the initial complex, in particular, due to its oxidation by intermediate particles that arise during the decomposition of peroxide. The oxidation of phenanthroline is also evidenced by the fact that a solid (copper hydroxide) precipitates at the deep stages of conversion. W 0 is the initial rate of formation of oxygenates, i.e. the rate at t → 0, when the concentration of the reagents remained practically unchanged, the concentration of the resulting products was small, and the concentration of the active form of the catalyst reached a maximum value. The definition of the initial reaction rate is included in the text. The analysis of the kinetic scheme, as indicated in the text, was carried out under the assumption that the concentration of X is quasistationary, i.e. the rate of change of its concentration is much less than the rate of reaction. The dependence of the reaction rate on the concentration of the catalyst is consistent with the assumption that the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of a homogeneously dissolved catalyst, and its solubility under the conditions of Fig. 5 reaches a limit value of 6.10−4M. The effect of cyclohexane concentration on the rate of formation of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide is shown in Fig. 6A. Further, we observed a decrease in the rate of oxidation of cyclohexane in the presence of n-heptane additives. In the experiment, the total concentration of alkanes (cyclohexane + n-heptane) was 0.46 M, while the concentration of cyclohexane was 0.06 M and the concentration of n-heptane was 0.4 M. It was found that under these conditions, the initial rate of formation of the total concentration of peroxides from cyclohexane and n-heptane (5 × 10−5Ms−1) was close to the rate of formation of peroxide from cyclohexane in an experiment with cyclohexane alone at a concentration of 0.46 M (5.5 × 10−5Ms−1). This means that the efficiency of accepting oxidizing species is the same in both cases. On the other hand, the cyclohexane oxidation rate in experiment [CyH] = 0.06 M and [n-C7H15] = 0.4 M (W 0 = 0.25 × 10−5Ms−1) was significantly less than in the experiment with cyclohexane [CyH] = 0.06 M (W 0 = 0.7 × 10−5Ms−1) in the absence of n-heptane additives, which means the competition of two alkanes for the oxidizing species arising from the decomposition of peroxide. In this regard, the dependence observed in Fig. 6A can naturally be explained on the basis of the assumption of competitive interaction of acetonitrile and cyclohexane with an intermediate species X of an oxidizing nature that arises during decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. (1) H 2 O 2 + compound 1 → X (2) X + CH 3 CN → … → products (3) X + RH → … → ROOH Here, stage (1) is the effective reaction of generating oxidizing species X at a rate of W 1; stages (2) and (3) are the transformations of CH3CN and RH with the formation, in particular, of alkyl hydroperoxide ROOH, induced by interactions that limit their speed with X. The rate constants of these interactions are k 2 and k 3, respectively. Assuming that the concentration of species X is quasi-stationary, we obtain the following expression for the initial rate of formation of ROOH: (4) d ROOH d t 0 = k 3 RH 0 W 1 k 2 CH 3 CN 0 + k 3 RH 0 Let us present equation (4) in the form of expression (5), convenient for the analysis of experimental data: (5) RH 0 / d RH / dt 0 = W 1 - 1 RH 0 + k 2 CH 3 CN 0 / k 3 It follows from Fig. 6B, that the experimental data shown in Fig. 6A, satisfy equation (5), which indicates the validity of the model of competitive interaction of species X with CH3CN and RH. As follows from Fig. 5B W1 = 2.1 × 10−4 M s−1, and k 2/k 3 = 0,075. The obtained value (k 2/k 3) is very different from the 0.006–0.01 ratio characterized the reactions involving hydroxyl radicals [49]. This is precisely the reason to believe that the hydroxyl radical is not a species that induces the oxidation of alkanes. The selectivity data (see the data in Table 1 below) shows that the oxidizing species has a slightly higher selectivity than the hydroxyl radical arising from the photolysis of hydrogen peroxide and in the Fenton reaction when catalyzing the decomposition of peroxide by vanadium salts [48]. Accordingly, it can be accume that the oxidizing species X is an ion of efficiently trivalent copper (CuOH+2 or CuO+) which differs little from the hydroxyl radical in terms of selectivity for linear alkanes, but differs significantly from it in terms of reactivity with respect to acetonitrile and alkane. We believe that CuO +, in reaction with alkanes, accepts a hydrogen atom, forming a copper hydroxo complex CuOH + (CuOH + ↔ Cu2 + + OH−) and a C-centered radical that interacts with molecular oxygen to give RO2 •. The latter is further reduced to the hydroperoxide ROOH (RO2 • + e- + H+ → ROOH. In addition, the formation of dimeric species of the type (CuO)2 2+ , cannot be excluded. In the article [51], very similar structures are described. Moreover, while alkanes can only be oxidized with this X-species, acetonitrile can additionally be hydrolyzed. Copper(III) can contribute to this, since it must be a fairly strong Lewis acid. We measured regio-, bond-, stereo-selectivity in oxidations of various alkanes. The obtained results for complexes 1, 3 and 4 are summarized in Table 1. The low values of these parameters in the oxidation of alkanes with X species obtained in the present work, is close to the selectivity found for reactions involving hydroxyl radicals (Entries 4–9) in Table 1, see also Refs. [49,51]. Catalyst 2 exhibits a bit higher activity in comparison with of complex 1, however at the same time, this catalyst is apparently faster in complete deactivation, since the concentration of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide after 4 h at 60 °C was not changed. See Fig. 7. Complexes 3 and 4 are characterized by a high decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide and either a high rate of their deactivation or a low rate of interaction with the resulting alkyl hydroperoxide. See Figs. 8 and 9. The catalytic activity of complexes 5 and 6 is less than the activity of complex 1, although the maximum alkyl peroxide yields are similar. See Figs. 10 and 11. The activity of complex 7 is close to activity of complex 1. A slightly lower alkyl hydroperoxide yield is probably due to a higher rate of interaction of 7 with the resulting hydroperoxide in comparison with the situation found for the complex 1 or the dimeric complex 7 effectively decomposes hydrogen peroxide via a catalase pathway that is not associated with the generation of intermediate species of an oxidizing nature, and therefore the yield of oxidizing species decreases. (See Fig. 12). Catalytic activity of 9 (see Fig. 13) is significantly lower than activity of complex 1 due to the presence of two donor methyl groups which stabilizes lower oxidation state of copper atom and obstruct the attainment of higher oxidation states that are actually work in the catalytic cycle. Moreover, steric effect of methyl groups results in a diminished ability of a copper atom to interact with coming ligands (H2O2 and acetonitrile)."
10,Conclusions,"Phenanthroline complexes were synthesized according to the method which involve interaction of copper(II) halides with phenanthrolines in ethanol solution. Same copper complexes (especially 1, 2 and 3) efficiently catalyze oxidation of alkanes with hydrogen peroxide in acetonitrile at mild conditions. Alkyl hydroperoxides are primary products which can be reduced to corresponding alcohols by the action of solid PPh3. The oxidizing species X generated from hydrogen peroxide is an ion of efficiently copper (CuOH+2 or CuO+), which differs slightly from the hydroxyl radical in terms of selectivity to linear alkanes, but differs significantly from it in terms of reactivity with respect to acetonitrile and alkane."
