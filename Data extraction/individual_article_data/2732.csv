0,Introduction,"Biomass is a renewable and extensive source of molecules for producing food ingredients, various chemicals and fuels. (Biomass Sugars for Non-Fuel Applications, 2015) In addition, utilizing renewable raw materials is becoming a trend in large-scale chemical technology. As such carbohydrates are the main source of renewable biomass and important target in green chemistry. Controlled catalytic hydrolysis of starch, cellulose and hemicelluloses results in simpler carbohydrates (e.g. mono-and disaccharides), which can be valorized to components of practical importance by numerous processes, such as isomerization, hydrogenation and oxidation. Hydrogenation of sugars to sugar alcohols is a good example of such a process (Biomass Sugars for Non-Fuel Applications, 2015). The hydrogenation process can be intensified using structured catalysts. Several types of structured catalysts have been developed over the last twenty years including monoliths, fibres, micro-structured catalysts and open foams. (Cybulski and Moulijn, 2005; Vergunst et al., 2002; Boomsma et al., 2003; Giani et al., 2006; Twigg and Richardson, 2007; Glenk et al., 2010; Wenmakers et al., 2010; Knorr et al., 2014; Lali et al., 2015; Genna et al., 2019; Monno et al., 2018; Stemmet et al., 2006; Saber et al., 2012; Zapico et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2019) By using structured catalysts, the benefits of traditional slurry and packed bed technologies can be combined. Structured catalysts have very thin layers of the porous catalyst material, which suppresses the internal mass transfer resistance in the catalyst pores and gives high effectiveness factors and, structured catalysts have open structures which minimize the pressure drop. (Cybulski and Moulijn, 2005) With structured catalysts, both continuous and discontinuous technologies are enabled, whereas slurry technology is in practice limited to batch and semibatch reactors. Packed beds represent a very proven technology, but they often suffer from internal mass transfer resistance in the catalyst pores which impairs the effectiveness factor. Diminishing the particle size is a remedy, but it has a limit: with small particle sizes the pressure drop in the bed becomes too high and the operability is lost. Open foam catalysts represent avant-garde in catalysis and reactor technology with several benefits including simple preparation, randomization of gas and liquid flows in the open cell structure, high effectiveness factor, low degree of backmixing and low pressure drop. (Cybulski and Moulijn, 2005; Vergunst et al., 2002; Boomsma et al., 2003; Giani et al., 2006; Twigg and Richardson, 2007; Glenk et al., 2010; Wenmakers et al., 2010; Knorr et al., 2014; Lali et al., 2015; Genna et al., 2019; Monno et al., 2018; Stemmet et al., 2006; Saber et al., 2012; Zapico et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2019) In this article, the modelling of open foam catalyst structures in a tubular reactor is described and discussed. The chemical system is hydrogenation of sugars to sugar alcohols on a ruthenium catalyst. Sugar alcohols have many practical applications, such as sweeteners, anti-caries and anti-inflammatory substances, additives in alimentary products and platform chemicals. From chemical and physical viewpoints, ruthenium is a superior catalyst compared to sponge nickel in sugar hydrogenation, because ruthenium is active, selective and durable, whereas sponge nickel is poisonous, pyrophoric and subject to deactivation. (Hoffer et al., 2003; Mikkola et al., 2000; Sifontes Herrera et al., 2012; Déchamp et al., 1995; Eisenbeis et al., 2009; Kilpiö et al., 2013; Aho et al., 2015; Sifontes Herrera et al., 2016; Najarnezhadmashhadi et al., 2020; Mikkola et al., 1999; Kuusisto et al., 2006; Kuusisto et al., 2008; Sifontes et al., 2010; Sifontes, 2012). Hydrogenation of sugars in continuous devices has been previously reported, for example by Déchamp et al. (Déchamp et al., 1995), Eisenbeis et al. (Eisenbeis et al., 2009), Kilpiö et al. (Kilpiö et al., 2013), Aho et al. (Aho et al., 2015), and Sifontes et al. (Sifontes Herrera et al., 2016), but they mainly used catalyst particles, monoliths, fibres, cloths and washcoated steel structures, but not open foams."
1,Experimental section,"Hydrogenation of arabinose and and a mixture of galactose and arabinose were successfully carried out in a laboratory-scale screening equipment, with six continuously operate parallel reactors, in which the foam catalysts were placed. An example of an open foam catalyst structure is shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor system is shown in Fig. 2 . Parallel reactors were used to enhance the experimental work: with the reactor system designed at our laboratory it is possible to carry out experiments simultaneously, for example, at six different temperatures, six different flow rates or with six different catalysts. The experiments were conducted under isothermal conditions and under a constant hydrogen pressure at 20 bar. The flow rates of aqueous sugar solutions were 0.5–2 mL/min, the hydrogen flow rate was 25–100 mL/min and the temperature interval of the experiments was 90–120 °C. The inlet sugar concentrations were varied between 0.13 and 0.66 mol/L. The isothermal reactor system was operated in a continuous mode and samples were withdrawn at the reactor outlet. The concentrations of the reactants and products were analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, HP 1100 Series LC). The catalyst turned out to be active and selective and the sugar alcohols were the only products detected. The experimental details are reported in a previous study of our group (Najarnezhadmashhadi et al. (Najarnezhadmashhadi et al., 2020)."
2,Kinetic model,
3,Hypotheses on reaction mechanisms,"3.1 Hypotheses on reaction mechanisms The kinetic model was based on the hypothesis of a plausible reaction mechanism on the surfaces of ruthenium nanoparticles on the active carbon support. The following hypotheses were assumed to be valid for the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. Sugar hydrogenation is known to be an irreversible reaction in practice; complete conversion of the reacting sugar to the corresponding sugar alcohol is reached, showing that the reaction time is long enough. This has been experimentally evidenced for the hydrogenation of glucose, arabinose, galactose, maltose, xylose, lactose and rhamnose. (Mikkola et al., 2000; Sifontes Herrera et al., 2012; Mikkola et al., 1999; Kuusisto et al., 2006; Kuusisto et al., 2008; Sifontes et al., 2010; Sifontes, 2012). Thus the aspect of the overall thermodynamics of the hydrogenation process is not an important issue and is discarded here. In previous research, (Sifontes Herrera et al., 2016; Mikkola et al., 2000; Sifontes Herrera et al., 2012; Mikkola et al., 1999; Kuusisto et al., 2006; Kuusisto et al., 2008; Sifontes et al., 2010; Sifontes, 2012) it has been suggested that the adsorption of sugar molecules on the catalyst surface is rapid compared to the hydrogenation step on the surface. This hypothesis has been used to describe the hydrogenation kinetics of individual sugar monomers and sugar mixtures on nickel and ruthenium surfaces (22–26). The surface reaction between adsorbed sugar and hydrogen is presumed to be the rate determining step in the process, whereas desorption of the sugar alcohol from the catalyst surface is assumed to be rapid compared to the surface reaction step. The details of the hydrogen and sugar adsorption on metal surfaces is still a matter of debate. Both dissociative and non-dissociative adsorption of hydrogen has been proposed, and the adsorption of the sugar molecules has been assumed to be either competitive or non-competitive with hydrogen. Competitive adsorption might be the first obvious hypothesis. On the other hand, the size difference between a sugar molecule and hydrogen is huge, suggesting that after the adsorption of the sugar molecule, some interstitial metal sites remain accessible for hydrogen adsorption. Based on this hypothesis, Mikkola et al. (Mikkola et al., 2000) and Salmi et al. (Salmi et al., 2004) have proposed a semi-competitive adsorption model for sugar molecules and hydrogen. The fundamental idea of the model is that the maximum coverage of the sugar molecule on the metal surface is θmax < 1, whereas hydrogen molecule or hydrogen atom can reach full coverage (θmax = 1) on the surface. The ultimate limit of the semi-competitive adsorption model is non-competitive adsorption, where the sites for the adsorption of the sugar molecule and hydrogen are regarded to be completely separate. For the sake of simplicity, the non-competitive adsorption model is used in the present work. Dissociative adsorption of hydrogen is presumed, but hydrogen is assumed to preserve its molecular identity in the surface reactions, so that two hydrogen atoms react with adsorbed sugar in the rate-determining surface reaction. This kind of adsorption behavior has been proposed, for example, for the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds on metal surfaces (Salmi et al., 1997). The adsorption of the reaction product, the sugar alcohol is neglected. This hypothesis has been confirmed by the previous work of Sifontes et al. (Sifontes, 2012): the adsorption affinity of the sugar monomer is clearly higher than that of the corresponding sugar alcohol. The catalyst surface is assumed to be ideal in the sense that the adsorption isotherm of Irving Langmuir can be applied. In case of sugar mixtures, the adsorption of different sugar molecules is assumed to be competitive, but the mutual interaction between the adsorbed sugar molecules is neglected. The adsorption and hydrogenation of two sugar molecules (A = arabinose, G = Galactose) to sugar alcohols (A’= arabitol, G’=galactitol) are considered."
4,Reaction mechanism and rate equations,"3.2 Reaction mechanism and rate equations Based on the hypotheses presented in the previous section, the mechanism of sugar hydrogenation can be written as follows; * denotes an active surface site for sugar adsorption and *’ is a site for hydrogen adsorption: A + * = A* A + * = A* H2 + 2*’ = 2H*’ A* + 2H*’ → A’ + * + *’ G* + 2H*’ → G’ + * + *’ Application of the quasi-equilibrium hypothesis on the adsorption steps and assuming that the hydrogenation steps are rate-determining, the rate expressions become for arabinose (I) and galactose (II) hydrogenation (see Appendix), (1) r I = k I c A c H ( 1 + K A c A + K G c G ) ( 1 + K H c H ) 2 (2) r II = k I c G c H ( 1 + K A c A + K G c G ) ( 1 + K H c H ) 2 where k I = k 1 K A K H c 0 c 0 ′ 2 and k II = k 2 K G K H c 0 c 0 ′ 2 For constant hydrogen pressure Eqs. (1) and (2) are simplified to (3) r I = k I ′ c A 1 + K A c A + K G c G (4) r II = k II ′ c G 1 + K A c A + K G c G because the term c H/(1 + K H c H)1/2) is constant during the experiment. Based on the reaction stoichiometry, the production and consumption rates of the compounds are obtained as follows, (5) r A = - r I (6) r A ′ = r I (7) r G = - r II (8) r G ′ = r II (9) r H = - r I - r II"
5,Mass transfer effects,"Very thin catalyst layers are used in solid foams (≪100 µm) and – in relative sense – sugar hydrogenation belongs to the category of slow reactions, (Mikkola et al., 2000) which implies that the internal mass transfer in the catalyst pores is rapid compared to the hydrogenation kinetics. The Thiele modulus is small and the effectiveness factor is high, in reality very close to 1 for thin catalyst layers as confirmed by numerical simulations of the reaction–diffusion model by Sifontes et al. (Sifontes Herrera et al., 2016; Sifontes et al., 2010). Therefore, the reaction–diffusion model for the catalyst layer is not needed, because the concentrations of hydrogen, the sugar and the sugar alcohol inside the catalyst pores of the open foam are equal to the concentrations at the outer surface of the catalyst layer. The external mass transfer from the liquid bulk to the catalyst surface causes a complication on the interpretation of the experimental data obtained with the parallel tubular reactor system. In order to reach sugar conversion, the residence time should be long enough, which means that low liquid velocities are used. The consequence is that the Reynolds number (Re) is low, and the Sherwood number (Sh) is also low (Salmi et al., 2019); low Sherwood number implies low values of the liquid–solid mass transfer coefficient. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 3 . Because of the relatively low sugar conversions and high hydrogen flow rates, the gas–liquid mass transfer is of secondary importance. All the experiments were conducted at a relatively low sugar conversion level under a high hydrogen flow, so it is reasonable to assume that the longitudinal gradient of dissolved hydrogen in the liquid phase was minor. A local mass balance for an organic component in the vicinity of the solid catalyst surface can be written as (10) r i Δ m cat + N i Δ A P = 0 where m cat is the mass of catalyst in the infinitesimal reactor volume element (ΔV). The catalyst mass in the volume element can be expressed with the catalyst bulk density (ρ B) and the volume of the volume element: Δmcat = ρ BΔV. The outer surface area of the solid catalyst (ΔA P) in the volume element is expressed by ΔA P/ΔV = a P, where a P denotes the surface area-to-volume ratio. The mass balance can be written as (11) r i ρ B + N i a P = 0 The flux (N i) is expressed with the simplest possible expression based on the film theory and the law of Fick: (12) N i = k Li ( c Li - c i ) where c i denotes the concentration at the outer surface of the catalyst material and c Li is the measurable concentration in the liquid bulk. After inserting Eq. (12) in Eq. (11), the mass balance takes the form: (13) c i / c Li - r i ρ B / ( k Li a P c Li ) = 1 which is valid for all the components in the system (i = H2, A, G, A’, G’). The non-linear equation system (13) is solved iteratively with respect to the surface concentrations (c i). The bulk-phase concentrations (c Li) are locally known, because they are obtained from the bulk-phase mass balances as will be described in section 5.1."
6,Reactor modelling,
7,Axial dispersion and plug flow models,"5.1 Axial dispersion and plug flow models The liquid-phase mass balances for the tubular reactor is based on the assumption of axial dispersion and plug flow in the open cell system in the foams, which was confirmed by studies of the residence time distribution in the reactor system. The dynamic form of the axial dispersion model was used to facilitate a robust numerical solution. Consequently, the mass balance for an arbitrary component (i) in the liquid phase can be written as (14) n i , i n ′ + ( - D i d c i dl A ) in = N i , Δ A P + n i , o u t ′ + ( - D i d c i dl A ) out + d n Li dt which after introducing the differential elements becomes (out-in = Δ) (15) Δ ( D i d c i dl A ) - Δ n i ′ = N i , Δ A P + d n Li dt The cross-section area of the liquid phase is A = ε LπR 2, where ε L is the liquid volume fraction of the open cell structure. The surface area-to-reactor volume ratio (a P) gives for the available surface area for mass transfer, Δ A P / Δ V = a P . The volume element is Δ V = π R 2 Δ l Furthermore, assuming that the liquid flow rate is virtually constant, the molar flow can be expressed by n i ′ = c Li w L π R 2 , where w L denotes the superficial velocity of the liquid. The amount of substance in the volume element is n Li = c Li ε L Δ V . After combining this information and inserting the corresponding expressions in Eq. (15) and letting the length element Δl → 0, the parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) is obtained (z = l/L), (16) d c Li dt = - w L ε L L d c Li dz + D i L 2 d 2 c Li d z 2 - N i , a P / ε L Eq. (16) assumes that the axial dispersion coefficient is locally constant. After introducing the Péclet number and the residence time of the liquid phase, the final form of the model equation is obtained, (17) d c Li dt = - 1 ε L τ L d c Li dz + 1 Pe τ L d 2 c Li d z 2 - N i , a P / ε L The model equation (17) is valid for both reactive and non-reactive conditions: for step-change experiments with inert tracers the interfacial flux (N i) is set to zero. The initial condition of the differential equation (17) is (18) c Li = c Li ( 0 ) i.e. the concentration profiles inside the reactor tube are known in the beginning of the experiment. For the reactor inlet and outlet, the closed boundary conditions of Peter Danckwerts (Danckwerts, 2013) are applied, (19a) c 0 L i = c Li - 1 Pe d c Li dz at z = 0 (19b) d c Li dz = 0 at z = 1 For high Péclet numbers, plug flow conditions are approached, and the dispersion term in Eq. (18) becomes negligible and the boundary conditions (19a) and (19b) are replaced by the initial condition c Li = c 0Li at z = 0. For steady-state conditions, the time derivative in Eq. (17) becomes zero and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is obtained."
8,Residence time distribution and Péclet number,"5.2 Residence time distribution and Péclet number The residence time distribution (RTD) in the reactor system and in the solid foam structure was studied with step response experiments, which gave the cumulative distribution function F(t). For a measurement signal s(t) which is directly proportional to the tracer concentration (s = a 0 + a 1 c), the distribution function is calculated from (20) F ( t ) = s ( t ) - s 0 s ∞ - s 0 where s 0 corresponds the signal for zero concentration of the tracer and s ∞ is the asymptotic value of the signal. Numerical differentiation of the experimental data gives the density function of the RTD, (21) E ( t ) = dF ( t ) dt From E(t), the mean residence time of the liquid (ε L τ L) and the dimensionless variance (σ 2) are obtained as follows, (22) ε L τ L = ∫ 0 ∞ E ( t ) t d t (23) σ 2 = ∫ 0 ∞ ( t / ( ε L τ L ) - 1 ) 2 E ( t ) d t From the variance, the Péclet number is obtained as an iterative solution of the equation: (24) σ 2 = 2 P e 2 ( P e - 1 + e - P e ) For large values of the Péclet number, the exponential term in Eq. (25) is negligible and a second-degree equation with respect to the Péclet number is obtained. The solution is straightforward, (25) Pe = 1 + 1 - 2 σ 2 σ 2"
9,Summary of the general model – Numerical aspects,"The model consists of the rate equations (rI and rII, Eqs. (3) and (4)). The generation rates (r i, Eqs. (5)–(9)), the mass transfer model (Eq. (13)), as well as the reactor model with the initial and boundary conditions (Eqs. (17)–(19)). The following numerical strategy can be applied. The system of parabolic PDEs (Eq. (17)) was discretized with finite differences for the dimensionless length coordinate (z). Backward differences should be used for the convection (plug flow) terms, the first derivatives, while central differences are used for the dispersion term, the second derivatives. The PDEs are in this way transformed to a large system of ODEs, an initial value problem, which is solved with an algorithm for stiff ODEs, the backward difference method of Henrici (Henrici, 1962). Inside the subroutine of the ODE solver, at each length coordinate, the mass transfer model (Eq. (13)) should be solved iteratively to obtain the concentrations on the outer catalyst surface, which are needed in the calculation of the reaction rates. During the estimation of the flow, rate and adsorption parameters, the ODE solver is operated under an optimization routine to find the optimal parameter values which minimized the objective function, i.e. residual sum of squares (Q), (26) Q = ∑ ( c Li - c Li , exp ) 2 where the subscript ‘exp’ refers to the experimentally recorded concentrations. A hybrid simplex-Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used to minimize the objective function. The model was implemented to a modelling, simulation and estimation software ModEst (Haario, 2011)."
10,Modelling results of residence time distribution studies,"The RTD measurements were carried out to determine the flow pattern. The structure of the reactor system was the same as in the hydrogenation experiments. To determine the RTD, step response experiments with two different liquid volumetric flow rates were carried out. A KCl standard solution as an inert tracer and de-ionized water were used to perform the experiments. The liquids were fed to the reactor system using a HPLC-pump (Knauer Smartline 100) and hydrogen was fed using a mass flow controller (Brooks Delta Series). During the step response experiments, the concentration of the tracer was recorded every 2 s by a conductivity meter (Radiometer CDM210, Radiometer Analytical)) at the outlet of the reactor. The step response experiments were carried out in the following way: de-ionized water was pumped through the reactor at 0.5 and 1 mL/min together with a hydrogen flow at25 mL/min at atmospheric pressure. After attaining a steady state, the pump tube was suddenly shifted from water to the KCl standard solution and at the same time thedata logging of the conductivity was commenced. Fig. 4 illustrates the F(t) curves. By numerical differentiation of the F(t) curves, the E(t) functions were obtained. The E curves at gas superficial velocity 0.004 m/s are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Eqs. (22), (23) and (25) gave the mean residence time, the variance and the Péclet number, respectively. The results of the calculations are summarized in Table 1 . Even though a signal broadening is visible in the density function curves in Fig. 5 so the variances are small, and consequently, the Péclet numbers are high, for the highest liquid flow rate (1 mL/min) the Péclet number exceeds 100. For the sake of comparison, the parameters of the axial dispersion model were determined by numerical simulation of the model, Eq. (17) where the flux term was set to zero (N i = 0) because the inert tracer did not interact with the foam. Similar results were obtained from the numerical simulation and the primary parameter estimation. The simulations with the experimental steps responses are compared in Figs. 6 and 7 demonstrating the excellent fit of the axial dispersion model to the reactor system. A further investigation of the flow pattern in the foam structure was performed by comparing two experiments: step responses from the entire reactor system (inlet region, feed section, foam and outlet region) with a stripped system, from which the foam was removed. The step responses from these experiments were almost identical, except a time delay obviously caused by the foam structure. The result implies that the signal broadening originates from the surrounding structure, whereas the foam itself provides almost plug flow conditions."
11,Modelling results of hydrogenation kinetics and mass transfer,
12,From the general model to simplifications,"8.1 From the general model to simplifications Because the RTD measurements indicated very high Péclet numbers, the estimation of kinetic parameters was done with the plug flow model (Pe →∞). Moreover, the reaction dynamics was rather slow and most part of the experimental data was recorded under stationary conditions. Therefore the steady state version of the general model Eq. (31) was adopted. The rate Eqs. (3) and (4) were the basis of the parameter estimation. The strong mutual correlation between the pre-exponential factor and activation energy is a serious problem in kinetic parameter estimation. This dilemma can partially be surmounted by an orthogonal transformation of the Arrhenius equation (i = A, i = G), (27) k i = k 0 e - E a i / R ( 1 / T - 1 / T 0 ) where T 0 is the reference temperature (often the average temperature of the experiments) and k0 is in fact the value of the rate constant at the average temperature. For the sake of simplicity and to avoid overparameterization of the estimation problem, the adsorption equilibrium parameters (K A, K G) were assumed to be independent of temperature. After inserting the rate equations in the local balance equation at the catalyst surface (13) for arabinose and galactose, the following expressions are obtained, (28) c A c LA + α A c A e - E a A / R ( 1 / T - 1 / T 0 ) c LA ( 1 + K A c A + K G c G ) = 1 (29) c G c LG + α G c G e - E a G / R ( 1 / T - 1 / T 0 ) c LG ( 1 + K A c A + K G c G ) = 1 where the merged parameters, the dimensionless moduli are (30) α A = k 0 A ρ B k LA a P and (31) α G = k 0 G ρ B k LG a P However, parameters α A and α G are related. The liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient (k Li) depends on the diffusion coefficient (D i), typically k Li is proportional to D i,γ where γ = 0.5…1. The film theory predicts γ = 1, whereas the surface renewal theory of Danckwerts predicts γ = 0.5. In many semi-empirical correlations values between 0.5 and 1 appear. Common correlations relate the Sherwood number to the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers (Salmi et al., 2019), giving the proportionality of the mass transfer coefficient k Li to the diffusion coefficient D i 2/3. The very frequently used correlation for the liquid-phase diffusion coefficient is the equation of Wilke and Chang (Salmi et al., 2019); (32) D i = ω ( ψ M ) 1 / 2 T V mi 0.6 μ The symbols in Eq. (32) are defined in Notation. As the other parameters except the molar volumes at normal boiling point (V mi) depend on the solvent only, the ratio of the diffusion coefficients of arabinose and galactose is easily obtained, (33) D G D A = V mA V mG 0.6 Consequently, assuming that k Li is proportional to D i 1/2…2/3, we get (34) k LG k LA = V mA V mG 0.3 . . . 0.4 The molar volumes of arabinose and galactose are calculated from the atomic increments of Le Bas according to the recipe provided by Reid et al. (Reid et al., 1987). The molar volumes, and ratios of diffusion and mass transfer coefficients are listed in Table 2 . The result implies that the mass transfer coefficient of galactose can be expressed with that of arabinose, (35) k LG = λ k LA where λ = 0.95.0.0.93 for the exponents 0.3…0.4 in Eq. (34) (Table 2) and Eqs. (28) and (29) become after introducing the dimensionless concentrations y A = c A/c LA and y G = c G/c LG, (36) y A + α A y A e - E a A / R ( 1 / T - 1 / T 0 ) 1 + K A c LA y A + K G c LG y G = 1 (37) y G + α A y G e - E a G / R ( 1 / T - 1 / T 0 ) κ λ ( 1 + K A c LA y A + K G c LG y G ) = 1 where κ = k 0A/k 0G. The numerical solution of Eqs. (36) and (37) gives always y-values ≤ 1. The simplified mass balances assuming plug flow and stationary state is for arabinose and galactose, (38) d c LA dz = - k 0 A ρ B c LA y A e - E a A / R ( 1 / T - 1 / T 0 ) 1 + K A c LA y A + K G c LG y G τ L (39) d c LG dz = - k 0 G ρ B c LG y G e - E a G / R ( 1 / T - 1 / T 0 ) 1 + K A c LA y A + K G c LG y G τ L The model used for the estimation of kinetic parameters comprises Eqs. (38) and (39). During the parameter estimation, the dimensionless surface concentrations (y A, y G) of arabinose and galactose were solved iteratively from Eqs. (36) and (37) and inserted in the differential equations (38) and (39), which were solved numerically with a backward difference algorithm of Henrici for stiff differential equations (Salmi et al., 2004). The objective function defined by equation (26) and the software ModEst was used in all the estimations (Haario, 2011)."
13,Hydrogenation modelling results of sugar mixtures,"8.2 Hydrogenation modelling results of sugar mixtures The parameter estimation results are summarized in Tables 3-4 and the model predictions are compared with experimental data in Figs. 8-9 . In order to elucidate the effect of external mass transfer and to obtain the optimal model fit, the value of αA was fixed to different values and the kinetic parameters were estimated by regression analysis. Then the degree of explanation (R 2) of different regression runs were compared. The results are shown in Table 3. The conclusion is that the optimal α-value is around 10, which confirms the presence of external mass transfer limitation – an α-value 0 would imply intrinsic kinetic control. On the other hand, as the α-value vas increased, the degree of explanation started to decrease confirming the existence of an optimum. The final parameter estimation results along with the estimation statistics are presented in Table 4. The errors of the parameters were obtained from the variances of the parameters, According to the table, the parameters are reasonably well estimated, most of them having the relative error less than 20%. The activation energies for arabitol and galactitol formation were 87 kJ/mol and 102 kJ/mol, respectively indicating that galactitol formation is favored at higher temperatures. The adsorption parameter was higher for arabinose than for galactose, which is expected because arabinose is a smaller molecule than galactose. The difference in the adsorption affinities of arabinose and galactose has previously been confirmed by Sifontes et al. (Sifontes, 2012), who carried out experiments with finely dispersed Ru/C slurries in a batch reactor. An inspection of the numerical values of the dimensionless concentrations y A and y G (Eqs. (36) and (37)) gives information on the role of the external mass transfer resistance: in the absence of the mass transfer limitations, the y-values become 1 but in the presence of profound mass transfer limitations the value approach zero. This is clearly visible in the data provided in Table 5 . At 90 °C, the lowest experimental temperature, the y-values are around 0.8, but as the temperature increases the y-values are low, below 0.1. The retarding effect of mass transfer increases with temperature. The simulations confirm that neglecting the mass transfer effect would have given erroneous values of the activation energies. From the value of the αA parameter (Table 3) and the kinetic parameter k 0A ρ B (Table 4), the liquid–solid mass transfer parameter k LA a P can be calculated using Eq. (30). According to Table 3, the optimal value of αA is within the interval 1…10, which gives values k LA a P = 0.11…1.1*10-3 s−1. In the literature references (Stemmet et al., 2006; Saber et al., 2012; Zapico et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2019), values of gas–liquid mass transfer coefficients for solid foam structures are given and the orders of magnitude of the gas–liquid mass transfer coefficient for most of the previous literature discussed in ref. (Nguyen et al., 2019) are similar to our estimate of the liquid–solid mass transfer coefficient. It should however be emphasized that the comparison is not straightforward, because the solid foams are not exactly the same. To obtain a value for the gas–liquid mass transfer coefficient for our system, separate measurements under inert conditions, in the absence of chemical reactions would be needed."
14,Conclusions,"A kinetic model for sugar hydrogenation was fitted to the experimental data obtained from open foam ruthenium catalysts. The model was applied on the hydrogenation of arabinose, galactose and glucose in a laboratory-scale open foam catalyst bed. The non-competitive adsorption model was used for the adsorption of sugars and hydrogen. A mathematical model for the open foam structured catalyst was developed based on the concept of axial dispersion as flow pattern. The effect of external mass transfer was included in the model, because it is in practice impossible to completely eliminate the external mass transfer limitations in continuous operation of the shallow foam bed: in order to obtain a high enough liquid residence time, low liquid velocities were used. To confirm the flow pattern of the foam structure, step change experiments were conducted. The model was able to reproduce the main features of the experimental observations, both for the flow pattern and the experimentally observed hydrogenation kinetics. The general principles of the model can be applied on other systems consisting of three-phase reactions in solid open foam catalysts. However, in case of gas–liquid mass transfer resistance, the model should be extended to comprise the gas-phase mass balances, too."
