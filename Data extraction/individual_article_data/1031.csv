0,Introduction,"Rapid intoxication, which has long been an important factor affecting alcoholic beverage consumption, has seriously restricted development of the huangjiu industry. Higher alcohols, which are present in huangjiu at concentrations as high as 500 mg/L, are the main compounds that accelerate the intoxication caused by huangjiu. These higher alcohols are by-products of alcoholic fermentation, so they occur naturally in beverages like beer (Missbach et al., 2017), grape wine (Sun et al., 2018) and distilled liquor (Gerong et al., 2019). Higher alcohols also have a significant impact on the taste and aroma characteristics of alcoholic beverages. Moderate amounts of higher alcohols increase plump, round and coordinated flavors, but excessive amounts impart varied flavors, are strongly intoxicating, and are responsible for the cerebral paralysis of alcoholic beverages (Chen et al., 2013). As the length increase of higher alcohols carbon chains, the effects of higher alcohols on the body last longer which will result in hangover (Greenberg, 1970). Over the last few decades, more and more studies have demonstrated that higher alcohols are the most intoxicating compounds in huangjiu, and that huangjiu consumption causes greater negative physiological effects than the consumption of brandy, red wine, rum, whisky or vodka (Sun et al., 2020). Therefore, achieving an appropriate level of higher alcohols is required to ensure huangjiu quality. Yeasts (primarily Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are the microorganisms most responsible for the biosynthesis of higher alcohols during fermentation. The S. cerevisiae genes responsible for the production of higher alcohols have been identified, and their deletion or overexpression can alter the production of higher alcohols. Overexpression of the branched-chain amino acid transaminase genes BAT1 and BAT2 increases the higher alcohols content (Li et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2017). Increasing the expression of ARO10, which encodes phenylpyruvate decarboxylase, the key enzyme in 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis, increases the concentration of 2-phenylethanol (Bolat et al., 2013). The overexpression of KDC (which encodes 2-ketoacid decarboxylase), ILV2 (acetolactate synthase), ILV3 (dihydroxyacid dehydratase), ILV5 (acetohydroxyacid reductoisomerase), and ADH6 (alcohol dehydrogenase) along with the deletion of PDC1 (pyruvate decarboxylase 1) significantly increases isobutanol production in S. cerevisiae (Kondo et al., 2012). Thus, regulating the expression of key S. cerevisiae genes is a proven strategy for reducing the production of higher alcohols during huangjiu fermentation. Because of controversy surrounding the use of genetic engineering techniques to modify the microbial strains used to make wine, other methods for regulating the expression of genes responsible for higher alcohols production must be used to decrease the higher alcohols content of huangjiu. The term yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) refers to the nitrogen that is preferentially utilized by S. cerevisiae during the fermentation process. Studies have shown that both insufficient YAN during S. cerevisiae fermentation and YAN supplementation have nonnegligible impacts on cell growth and higher alcohols formation. Insufficient YAN reduces the rate and yield of fermentation, and YAN deprivation can slow or block fermentation (Varela et al., 2004). Adding ammonium salts, such as diammonium phosphate or ammonium chloride, to the fermentation can decrease the risk of YAN deficiency and slow the formation of undesirable volatile compounds, including higher alcohols (Clement et al., 2013). Previously studies found that the higher alcohols content was inversely proportional to the initial nitrogen concentration of the fermentation broth, within the appropriate nitrogen source range. For example, ammonium sulfate addition reduced the higher alcohols content of a synthetic fermentation medium (Hernández-Orte et al., 2005). Finally, studies have shown that the YAN level regulates higher alcohols synthesis by affecting expression of the genes responsible for higher alcohols production (Arias et al., 2007; Rollero et al., 2015; Ugliano et al., 2011). Thus, controlling the YAN concentration during the huangjiu fermentation process will be of great value in efforts to decrease the higher alcohols content of huangjiu. The aims of this study were to: (1) investigate the effect of YAN concentration on expression of the genes responsible for higher alcohols production under different growth conditions and during different Saccharomyces cerevisiae HJ growth stages, and (2) the effect of the YAN concentration on the production of higher alcohols during huangjiu fermentation. The results are expected to provide a theoretical basis for the use of nitrogen in regulating higher alcohols production during huangjiu fermentation, with the goal of improving huangjiu quality."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Media and reagents,"2.1 Media and reagents Polished rice was purchased from local rice markets, and wheat qu samples were obtained from huangjiu factories in Shanghai, China. Amylase (35,000 U/mL) and glucoamylase (500 U/mL) were obtained from Suzhou Hongda Enzyme Co., Ltd. (Taicang, Jiangsu Province, China). Saccharomyces cerevisiae HJ (S. cerevisiae HJ) used in this study was stored on YPD slopes (Glucose 20 g/L, peptone 20 g/L, yeast extract 10 g/L, agar 20 g/L). All chemical reagents were analytically pure."
3,Preparation of rice saccharification liquid and huangjiu fermentation,"2.2 Preparation of rice saccharification liquid and huangjiu fermentation Rice soaking and steaming were carried out as described in our previous report (Wei et al., 2017). For liquefaction and saccharification, the steamed rice was mixed with liquifying enzyme (700 U/(g rice)), glucoamylase (5 U/(g rice)) and wheat qu (0.1 g/(g rice)) and kept at 60 °C. After saccharification, the rice saccharification liquid was packed and sterilized for 20 min at 115 °C. The sterilized mixture inoculated with S. cerevisiae HJ was used for the studies in parts 3.1 and 3.2. Diammonium phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4), ammonium hydrogen carbonate (NH4HCO3), ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), urea ((NH2)2CO), phenylalanine (Phe), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), and glutamic acid (Glu) were used as YAN sources. They were added as a solution at a concentration of 200 mg/L, no YAN source was added to the control group. The primary fermentation was conducted at 28 ± 1 °C for 4 days with stirring once a day, and the post fermentation was conducted at 15 ± 1 °C for 15 days with stirring once every two days. To prepare yeast starter for huangjiu brewing, a YPD culture containing S. cerevisiae HJ was incubated at 28 °C and 180 rpm for 18 h, then it was used to inoculate the sterilized mixture described above, and the resulting culture was incubated at 28 °C and 180 rpm for 18 h. Huangjiu fermentation was carried out as previously described (Liu et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2017). The YAN source to be tested was added at a concentration of 0, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/L when the steamed rice, wheat qu and water were mixed. The primary fermentation was conducted at 28 ± 1 °C for 4 days with stirring once a day, and the post fermentation was conducted at 15 ± 1 °C for 15 days with stirring once every two days."
4,Gene expression analysis,"2.3 Gene expression analysis Yeast cultured in YPD was used to inoculate (at 5%) rice saccharification liquid containing 0, 200 or 400 mg/L YAN (calculated by nitrogen), and then this mixture was cultured at 28 °C. Samples were taken at the end of lag phase, the middle of exponential phase and the beginning of stationary phase for subsequent RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Cat. No B610409; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) according to manufacturer's protocol. RNA quality was estimated using agarose gel electrophoresis and a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Q5000, Quawell, San Jose, USA). Target gene cDNAs were prepared through reverse transcription. Total RNA (10 ng–5 μg), Oligo (dT)18 primer (100 pmol) and RNase free dH2O (12.5 μL) were sequentially added to a sterile, nuclease-free tube. After incubating for 5 min at 65 °C, 5 × reaction buffer (4 μL), RNase inhibitor (200 U), dNTPs (10 mM), M-MLV reverse transcriptase (200 U), and RNase free dH2O (to 20 μL) were added and the resulting mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by heating at 70 °C for 10 min, and the reverse transcription product was stored at −80 °C. The relative expression levels of genes involved in higher alcohols production were assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Genes were amplified using the primers shown in Table 1 . After qPCR amplification using qTOWER3 G touch (Analytik Jena, Germany), the 2−ΔΔCt method of relative quantification (Kenneth, Livak, & Schmittgen, 2001) was used to quantify the relative expression levels of BAT1, BAT2, ILV2, ILV3, PHA2, LEU2, BAP2, AGP1, TAP2, GAP1, ARO8, ARO9, and ACT1 at different YAN concentrations and culture stages. The values represent the average, at the relative mRNA level, of three independent biological replicates with at least three technical replicates each."
5,Determination of fermentation parameters,"2.4 Determination of fermentation parameters The pH value was measured using a pH meter, total acid and amino nitrogen were determined by using titration (Gump et al., 2002). Reducing sugar content was determined by using the dinitro salicylic acid (DNS) method. Biogenic amines were determined using a previously described method (Papageorgiou et al., 2018). The ethanol concentration and higher alcohols content were determined as previously described (Vilanova et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2017). The HPLC conditions used to analyze amino acids was previously described by Wang et al. (2014). The content of volatile flavor compounds was measured by described (Liu et al., 2019), flavor compounds were quantified using external standards, and 2-octanol was used as the internal standard for semi quantitative analysis to eliminate variations in extraction efficiency. Analysis was performed using a Thermo Fisher Trace 1300 ISQ mass spectrometer. Separation was carried out on a TG-Wax (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) with 1.0 mL/min helium as the carrier gas. The program temperature was 40 °C for 2 min, raised at 4 °C/min to 240 °C and held for 10 min. The injection port was set at 250 °C in the splitless mode. Mass specta were acquired in the electron ionization (EI) mode at 70 eV and with a mass range of m/z 33–350. The transfer and ion source temperatures were 240 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The cell concentration was measured as the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) with a spectrophotometer (UV-2100 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer, UNICO Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai) after appropriate dilution."
6,Data processing,"2.5 Data processing Data processing and analysis were performed using SPSS Statistics 22.0 software. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in a completely randomized design followed by Tukey's test (p < 0.01) was used to determine the significance of differences between averages, and the results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed and plotted using SIMCA 13.0."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effects of NH4Cl supplementation on higher alcohol metabolism,"3.1 Effects of NH4Cl supplementation on higher alcohol metabolism The YAN concentration significantly influenced the expression of genes involved in higher alcohols production. As shown in Fig. 1 a, BAT1, BAT2, ARO9, LEU2, GAP1, AGP1, and BAP2 were up-regulated during lag phase at 200 mg/L YAN, while the other five target genes were down-regulated. During exponential phase, BAT1, ILV2, ILV3, LEU2, and BAP2 were up-regulated, and the other seven genes were down-regulated. During stationary phase, BAT1, BAT2, ILV2, ILV3, ARO8, LEU2, and BAP2 were up-regulated. BAT1, LEU2 and BAP2 were up-regulated during all growth stages at 200 mg/L YAN, while only PHA2 and TAT2 were down-regulated during all growth stages at 200 mg/L YAN. The relative transcription levels at 400 mg/L YAN (Fig. 1b) were quite different than those observed at 200 mg/L YAN. Expression levels of BAT1, ILV2, ILV3, ARO9, PHA2, LEU2 and GAP1 were elevated during lag phase, while expression of the other five genes was down-regulated. During exponential phase, only BAT1, PHA2, and GAP1 were up-regulated, and the other nine genes were down-regulated. These results indicated that the expression patterns of genes involved in higher alcohols production were affected by the YAN concentration at each stage. BAT1 and GAP1 were up-regulated during all growth stages at 400 mg/L YAN, and the other genes showed different trends during different growth stages. During lag phase, BAT1, ARO8, ARO9, LEU2, GAP1, and TAT2 showed the same trend with 200 mg/L and 400 mg/L YAN. BAT1, ARO9 and LEU2 were moderately up-regulated, whereas GAP1 was modestly up-regulated at 200 mg/L YAN and significantly up-regulated at 400 mg/L YAN. TAT2 was modestly down-regulated at 200 mg/L YAN but significantly down-regulated at 400 mg/L YAN. Thus, GAP1 and TAT2 were significantly affected by the change in YAN concentration, with opposite effects. During exponential growth, BAT1, BAT2, ARO8, ARO9, AGP1 and TAT2 showed the same trend with 200 mg/L and 400 mg/L YAN. BAT1, ILV2, ILV3, LEU2 and BAP2 were expressed at higher levels at 200 mg/L YAN than at 400 mg/L YAN, which suggests that the YAN availability during exponential phase may significantly change the metabolic flux in higher alcohols synthesis. During stationary phase, expression of ARO9, PHA2, GAP1, AGP1, and TAT2 were modestly down-regulated at 200 mg/L YAN. At 400 mg/L YAN, only PHA2 was down-regulated, and BAT1, BAT2, ILV2, ARO8, ARO9, GAP1, AGP1, TAT2 were significantly up-regulated compared with their expression at 200 mg/L YAN. This suggests that low YAN values are not conducive to gene expression during stationary phase. In S. cerevisiae HJ, BAT1 encodes a mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid transferase that catalyzes the biosynthesis of l-valine from α-ketoisovalerate, while BAT2 encodes a cytosolic branched-chain amino acid transferase that catalyzes the degradation of branched-chain amino acids to α-ketoacids through the Ehrlich pathway; thus, BAT1 and BAT2 have opposite effects on the production of higher alcohols (Colon et al., 2011; Picotti et al., 2013). In a previous study of must fermentation (Ma et al., 2017), overexpression of BAT1 (Ma et al., 2017)reduced the isobutanol and butanol concentrations by 39.14% and 37.18%, respectively, and reduced the total high alcohols content from 463.82 mg/L to 292.83 mg/L. Down-regulation of LEU2, which would decrease the production of α-ketoisocaproic acid (a precursor of isoamylol), reduced the isoamylol concentration by 11.82% and the higher alcohols content by 9.97% (Giudici et al., 1990). These results indicate that regulating gene expression can control the synthesis of higher alcohols. However, the amount of YAN added had unpredictable effects on the expression of different genes."
9,Effects of YAN type on S. cerevisiae HJ fermentation,"3.2 Effects of YAN type on S. cerevisiae HJ fermentation Nitrogen sources present in the raw materials (water, rice and wheat) could provide the nitrogen necessary for anabolism in S. cerevisiae HJ, but the addition of YAN would provide the yeast more options. S. cerevisiae HJ displayed similar growth trends when different YAN sources were added at the start of fermentation (Fig. 2 a). Cell density plateaued after approximately 25 h of fermentation in presence of all the YAN sources tested. S. cerevisiae HJ achieved the highest cell density plateau when urea was used as the YAN source, while its ethanol production was a litter lower. Ammonium sulfate showed a negative effect on the growth of S. cerevisiae HJ and ethanol production. These results were consistent with the report that different yeast strains have different nitrogen source preferences (Magasanik & Kaiser, 2002). The YAN source also had important effects on higher alcohols production (Fig. 2b). The addition of ammonium salts ((NH4)2HPO4, NH4HCO3, (NH4)2SO4, NH4Cl) substantially reduced the content of higher alcohols of the fermentation broth, while the addition of amino acids or urea, in most cases, had a much more modest lowering effect. S. cerevisiae HJ produced the lowest higher alcohols content (102 mg/L; 36% of the control value) when NH4Cl was the YAN source, while the highest total higher alcohols content (585 mg/L; 205% of the control value) was produced when Phe was the YAN source. When the concentrations of individual higher alcohols were assessed (Fig. 2b), the effect of the YAN source was not entirely consistent. The use of Phe as the YAN source dramatically increased the 2-phenylethanol concentration (to 490 mg/L), compared with the control, while the use of Leu increased the isoamylol concentration (to 153 mg/L). This may be due to the addition of specific amino acids that promote flux through the Ehrlich pathway. However, the use of other YAN sources did not result in an anomalous result for a single higher alcohol. Instead, the concentrations of each of the higher alcohols varied essentially in line with the results seen for the sum of the higher alcohol concentrations (the higher alcohols content) (Fig. 2b). In summary, the choice of YAN source had a measurable but not remarkable effect on the cell growth rate, final cell density and ethanol concentration of the fermentation. The main differences among the YAN sources were their effects on the higher alcohols content. Ammonium salts reduced the higher alcohols content more substantially than urea or amino acids, which is consistent with the finding that S. cerevisiae prefers inorganic nitrogen sources over amino acids (Bell & Henschke, 2005). In particular, the addition of NH4Cl decreased the higher alcohols content by 64.2%, while other ammonium salts had somewhat reduced abilities to lower the higher alcohols content. The effects followed the order (NH4)2HPO4 > NH4HCO3 > (NH4)2SO4. Addition of ammonium nitrogen also decreased the higher alcohols content during cachaca fermentation (Vidal et al., 2013). Similarly, Torrea and coworkers (Torrea et al., 2011) showed that ammonium nitrogen was more efficiently reduced the higher alcohols content of grape wine. Given these results, (NH4)2HPO4 and NH4Cl were selected for further experiments to study the effect of the ammonium salt concentration on higher alcohol formation."
10,Effects of ammonium salt concentration on S. cerevisiae HJ fermentation,"3.3 Effects of ammonium salt concentration on S. cerevisiae HJ fermentation Addition of (NH4)2HPO4 had negligible effects on the reducing sugar and ethanol concentrations, as well as the yeast content of the fermentation mixture (Table 2 ). The total acid content, however, increased and the pH decreased with increasing (NH4)2HPO4 concentration. In contrast to these relatively minor effects, (NH4)2HPO4 addition significantly reduced the higher alcohols content of the fermentation mixture. At the end of the primary fermentation stage (Fig. 3 a), the total higher alcohols content of the 300 mg/L (NH4)2HPO4 group (147 mg/L) was just over half (53%) that of the control group (280 mg/L). The isopropanol concentration was about 2-fold higher than that of the control group. The concentrations of isobutanol, isoamylol and 2-phenylethanol were lowered 43%, 46%, and 63%, respectively, compared with those of the control group. At the end of the post fermentation stage (Fig. 3b), the total higher alcohols content of the 300 mg/L (NH4)2HPO4 group (162 mg/L) was 37% lower than that of the control group (257 mg/L), although the higher alcohols content increased slightly during this period. During the post fermentation stage, the isopropanol concentration of the 300 mg/L (NH4)2HPO4 group decreased from 29 to 24 mg/L, the isobutanol concentration decreased from 15 to 13 mg/L, and the isoamylol concentration decreased from 54 to 51 mg/L, while the 2-phenylethanol concentration increased from 45 to 72 mg/L. Thus, the increase in 2-phenylethanol may be the main reason for the increased higher alcohols content of the 300 mg/L (NH4)2HPO4 group during the post fermentation stage. Addition of NH4Cl to the fermentation mixture had minimal effects on most of the fermentation parameters (Table 2), with only the pH showing an NH4Cl-dependent decrease from pH 4.47 (no-NH4Cl control) to pH 3.44 (400 mg/L YAN NH4Cl group). Increasing of the NH4Cl concentration decreased the higher alcohols content of the fermentation mixture. At the end of the primary fermentation stage (Fig. 4 a), the total higher alcohols content of the 300 mg/L YAN NH4Cl group (139 mg/L) was significantly lower (nearly 50% lower) than that of the control group (280 mg/L). The concentrations of isopropanol, isobutanol, isoamylol, and 2-phenylethanol were 19, 18, 44, and 50 mg/L, respectively. At the end of the post fermentation stage (Fig. 4b), the higher alcohols content of the 400 mg/L NH4Cl group (116 mg/L) was 54.85% lower than that of the control group (257 mg/L). However, the particularly low pH (3.44) of the fermentation broth during this stage and the NH4Cl concentration may have slowed the rate of fermentation. The higher alcohols content of the 300 mg/L NH4Cl and 200 mg/L NH4Cl groups were 154 and 161 mg/L, respectively, representing reductions of 37% and 40%, respectively, compared with the control group; the difference between these two groups was not statistically significant. Meanwhile, the addition of NH4Cl showed a more effective reduction on higher alcohol than that of (NH4)2HPO4 at the same YAN concentration. In summary, addition of 300 mg/L (NH4)2HPO4 reduced the higher alcohols content by 37% and addition of 200 mg/L NH4Cl reduced the higher alcohols content by 40%. Considering additional factors such as the pH, ethanol concentration and the total amount of nitrogen source required during the entire fermentation process, 200 mg/L NH4Cl was selected as the optimal concentration and YAN source for further experiments."
11,Effect of NH4Cl addition on huangjiu fermentation,"3.4 Effect of NH4Cl addition on huangjiu fermentation In this experiment, samples of huangjiu were brewed using either 200 mg/L NH4Cl as the nitrogen source (experimental group), or without added YAN (control group). As seen in Table 3 , addition of NH4Cl during the primary fermentation period had a significant effect on only the pH of the fermentation mash (3.51 vs. 4.14; p < 0.05). However, the pH difference was not significant (3.72 vs. 4.32; p > 0.05) at the end of the post fermentation period. Therefore, the use of 200 mg/L NH4Cl as the YAN source did not have a significant effect on the gross fermentation parameters. It did, however, have an effect on the production of higher alcohols. The higher alcohols content decreased by 24.63% at the end of primary fermentation (Fig. 5 a) and by 38.63% at the end of post fermentation. Among individual higher alcohols, the isobutanol, isoamylol and 2-phenylethanol concentrations decreased by 47.06%, 27.88% and 44.16%, respectively. A principle component analysis (PCA) score plot based on the peak areas of all of the volatile components (except higher alcohols), was constructed to visualize the effect of NH4Cl addition on the flavor compound profile (Fig. 5b). This plot reveals that the volatiles profile of huangjiu changed remarkably during the fermentation period and with NH4Cl addition. The variances of PC1 and PC2 were 38.3% and 27.2%, respectively, collectively representing 65.5% of the total volatile compounds variability. The loading plot of 52 major volatile compounds on PC1 and PC2, also shown in Fig. 5b, revealed the volatile compounds characteristic of each fermentation time. Compounds located on the left side of the plot contributed significantly to the separation of primary fermentation from post fermentation. Compounds in the top left quadrant, including isoamyl acetate, phenethyl acetate, glycerin, 2-ethylphenol, 2-nonanol, isobutyl acetate, nonanoic acid, linalyl iosbutyrate, and dodecanoic acid, were characteristic of primary fermentation with the addition of 200 mg/L NH4Cl. Compounds distributed within the lower left quadrant, including benzaldehyde, hexyl hexanoate and 2-undecanol, were characteristic of the primary fermentation control. Compounds at the top right, including acetyl eugenol, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl caprate, ethyl laurate, l-α-terpineol, hexanoic acid, 2-methylnaphthalene and others, were characteristic of post fermentation with the addition of 200 mg/L NH4Cl. Compounds distributed within the lower right, including 2-methylbutyl caproate, 1-octanol, 1-heptanol, 2-ethyhexanol, nerol, 2-phenylacetamide and others, were characteristic of the post fermentation control. This analysis suggests that NH4Cl addition causes fatty acid formation, which promotes the synthesis of esters such as ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl caproate, ethyl octanoate and ethyl decanoate. Of these, ethyl esters of short chain fatty acids, like ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl valerate, ethyl hexanoate have been reported to exhibit floral and fruity odors and are considered important contributors to the aroma of wine. Ethyl esters of medium and long chain fatty acids, including ethyl myristate, ethyl laurate, ethyl caprate and others, may impart highly desired fruity, candy, and perfume-like aromas to fermented beverages such as beer, wine, and Chinese baijiu (Hu et al., 2018; Pires et al., 2014). Amino acids are important flavor substances in rice wine (Botella et al., 1990) and play a well-known role in the biosynthesis of proteins and enzymes (Arrieta & Prats-Moya, 2012). Amino acids are also precursors for the biosynthesis of alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and ketoacids (Niu et al., 2012). The effect of NH4Cl addition on the amino acids content of huangjiu is shown in Fig. 6 a. The free amino acids content of the control group at the end of fermentation was 4.95 g/L, while that of the experimental group was 5.52 g/L. The reason for this may be that the NH4Cl provides added amino groups for the pyruvate-acetolactate system to synthesize amino acids, thus decreasing amino acid decomposition via the Ehrlich pathway. This is consistent with the conclusion that S. cerevisiae prefers inorganic nitrogen sources over amino acids (Bell & Henschke, 2005). The concentrations of leucine, valine and phenylalanine, the primary precursors for higher alcohols, were higher in the experimental group (109 mg/L, 194 mg/L and 658 mg/L, respectively) than in the control group (90 mg/L, 178 mg/L and 563 mg/L, respectively). The higher leucine content may reflect the strong dependence of amino acid degradation on the cytosolic availability of NADH and/or of the amino acceptor α-ketoglutarate (Vidal et al., 2015). Biogenic amines are formed via a combination of transamination reactions and the decarboxylation of precursor amino acids (Sebastian et al., 2011). NH4Cl addition apparently affected the amino acid composition of the fermentation mash, which subsequently affected the synthesis of biogenic amines. Biogenic amines are considered normal food ingredients when present at safe levels. However, excessive intake of biogenic amines, especially the most toxicologically important biogenic amines histamine and tyramine, can cause headache, impaired breathing, blushing, itching, skin irritation, tachycardia, hypertension and vomiting (Feddern et al., 2019). Fortunately, as seen in Fig. 6b, the addition of 200 mg/L NH4Cl did not significantly alter the biogenic amines content (experiment, 36 mg/L; control, 34 mg/L) (p > 0.05). This level is less than 50 mg/L, which is considered to be within the safe range (Anli & Bayram, 2009)."
12,Conclusion,"In an effort to decrease the higher alcohols content of huangjiu, the effects of different YAN sources on higher alcohols production by the huangjiu brewing yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae HJ were studied. The qPCR experiments demonstrated that the addition of YAN sources to the fermentation process significantly affected the expression of key genes responsible for higher alcohols production in S. cerevisiae HJ, which indicated proper YAN regulation could decrease higher alcohols production in huangjiu fermentation process. A YAN source suitable for yeast fermentation and able to reduce higher alcohols production during the fermentation process was identified, and a strategy for its addition to the huangjiu brewing process was optimized. Fermentation results showed that use of this YAN source reduced the higher alcohols content of huangjiu by a statistically significant 39%, and reduced the concentrations of isobutanol, isoamylol and 2-phenylethanol by 47%, 28% and 44%, respectively. PCA results showed that the types of ester compounds increased after adding assimilable nitrogen, which improved the flavor of huangjiu compared with the control group. Meanwhile, the amino acids content was increased, which improved the nutrient content of the huangjiu, while the biogenic amines content was not changed. These results provide positive guidance for the industrial application of a NH4Cl regulation strategy that will improve huangjiu quality and accelerate development of the huangjiu industry."
