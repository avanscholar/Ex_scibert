0,Introduction,
1,Biogas and biomethane,"1.1 Biogas and biomethane Biogas is a significant alternative source of energy in addition to water, wind and solar power plants. It is produced by anaerobic fermentation, which belongs to widespread biotechnologies in the field of wastewater treatment, sludge stabilization and organic waste treatment today. The energy contained in biogas in the form of CH4 is not yet fully utilized everywhere, particularly its heat component, which faces limits local conditions and the difficulty of distribution. Ensuring energy transport where it can be used completely needs a developed transport system that is currently only built for electricity and natural gas. In order to use the natural gas transport system, the low pressure and the presence of carbon dioxide in the biogas is in question, so it is an attempt to upgrade biogas to renewable natural gas (biomethane) by removing CO2 (Ryckebosch et al., 2011). The removal of CO2 is currently based on expensive physico-chemical processes (absorption, adsorption, membrane and cryogenic techniques) (Lombardi and Carnevale, 2013; Yousef et al., 2016)."
2,Problems of electricity from alternative sources,"1.2 Problems of electricity from alternative sources Solving the problem of global warming due to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion, especially in electricity generation, attracts more and more attention to the development and use of alternative, renewable energy sources (Starr et al., 2014). Nowadays, alternative sources of energy such as solar or wind powers are most widely used, but these technologies produce electrical energy intermittently and independently of the current consumption. Two main energy systems - the distribution and consumption of electricity and natural gas - differ fundamentally from one another in the possibilities of the conservation and storage of energy. Electricity cannot be stored, so it is necessary to look for the possibilities of using a power that exceeds a consumption, which causes problems with the overloading of the distribution grid. However, surplus electricity can be used not only in pumping power plants but can be stored, for example, in the form of H2 produced by the electrolysis of water P2G (power-to-gas system). Study of Gahleitner (2013) brings the overview of existing or planned pilot and full-scale P2G applications. The energy of hydrogen can be utilized directly in fuel cells or as a clean gas fuel. But the property of the hydrogen gas provides technical problems with transport and storage that demand high pressure, low temperature and therefore expensive materials (Niaz et al., 2015). This route redistribution of power is indeed environmentally friendly, but economically challenging (Gahleitner, 2013; Luo and Angelidaki, 2012)."
3,Biomethane from carbon dioxide,"1.3 Biomethane from carbon dioxide The production of methane from CO2 using hydrogen combines two solutions of environmental problems and fits into the recently developed area of carbon capture and utilization for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (CCU, carbon capture and utilization). Within this trend, the effort is to produce methane from CO2 with all benefits of its use, and this biotechnology is being promoted against chemical methods. Conversion requires cheap electricity to produce H2 and a suitable CO2 source to make the process economically viable (Starr et al., 2014). Capturing CO2 from flue gas and its methanisation is expensive; the cheapest source for biomethane is CO2 in biogas from anaerobic fermentation, when H2 is added from excess electricity. In the study of Ahern et al. (2015), for the energy balance of this process, the PLEXOS model was used. Their results showed that Ireland has the potential for biomethane production by upgrading biogas from full-scale applications of anaerobic digestion, accounting for 10.2% of gaseous fuel energy in transport. The use of further biomethane converted from CO2 in biogas would increase total biomethane in the transport of an additional 8.9%. Biofuel certificates contribute to the economic viability of the process. From a long-term prognosis and comparison of biomethane production from anaerobic digestion and biomass gasification and its impact on GHG (greenhouse gases) reduction, Koornneef et al. (2013) concluded, that in 2050 could be even negative GHG production. From CO2, biologically different types of microorganisms can produce not only CH4 but also utilizable organic substances or fuels such as alcohols, organic acids, and others. Producing microorganisms can be prepared by metabolic engineering for high yields and reaction rates (Woo, 2017). Cheah et al. (2016) summarized in their study the different methods of CO2 capture and utilization with an emphasis on bioconversion to CH4. The perspective alternative of the reuse of energy preserved in the form of H2 seems to be its biotransformation to biomethane by the reaction with CO2 and produced biomethane is subsequently injected into the existing natural gas grid (Leonzio, 2016). Reactions of the biological reduction of CO2 by hydrogen are able to carry out the hydrogenotrophic methanogens that are always present in many technical anaerobic cultures."
4,Microbiology of methanogenesis,"An anaerobic digestion is the complex process of decomposition of organic substances consisting of successive biochemical processes - hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis (Borja, 2011). The specific group of microorganisms is responsible for each phase - hydrolytic-fermentative, proton-reducing acetogenic, hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetoclastic methanogens, and their metabolic interaction is very important. Each of these phases takes place at different rates, with methanogenesis being the slowest. The balance between different stages of bioconversion is needed to achieve the process efficiency, which can be influenced by a number of factors (Ahring et al., 2001; Conrad and Wetter, 1990; Demirel and Scherer, 2011; Ju et al., 2008; Varel et al., 1980). The complex organic substrate is metabolized by the activities of all mentioned groups of microorganisms through series of intermediates, H2, CO2, alcohols and low fatty acids, especially butyric and propionic. Butyric and propionic acids are converted by syntrophic acetogens into direct precursors of methanogenesis - acetic acid, CO2 and H2. Methane can be formed by methanogens from a limited number of substrates, CO2 and H2, acetic acid, C1-compounds and methyl compounds such as methanol, methylamines and methylsulfides (Costa and Leigh, 2014). The concentration of dissolved hydrogen which is dependent on its partial pressure is a very important parameter. Homoacetogenesis or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis take place at high concentration (≥500Pa) of hydrogen, at low concentration, homoacetogenic oxidation of acetic acid takes place, hydrogen and CO2 being formed. All possible reactions of methanogenesis are given in Table 1 (Demirel and Scherer, 2008)."
5,Methanogenic Archeae,"2.1 Methanogenic Archeae Methanogens are microorganisms, which belong to domain Archeae. Their taxonomy and division into four classes are shown in Table 2 . Methanogens have highly specific substrate and living conditions requirements and they become often the limiting group of the whole anaerobic process. The basic characteristics of certain methanogens, specific substrates, and requirements for the cultivation conditions are given in Table 3 . From Table 3, it can be seen that methanogens are able to metabolize only limited types of substrates; hydrogenotrophic methanogens produce methane from a mixture of CO2 and H2 or formic acid, acetotrophic methanogens from acetic acid, and C1- and methylated compounds are substrates for methylotrophic methanogens (Demirel and Scherer, 2008). Methanosarcina spp. are the only methanogens, which are able to use all the substrates mentioned above and metabolize up to 9 different substrates. This genus is also very diverse in the terms of morphology (Galagan, 2002). The occurrence and activity of methanogens are affected by many parameters, the temperature is the most important from them (Conrad and Wetter, 1990; Tonouchi, 2002; Varel et al., 1980). Mesophilic methanogens have the optimal temperature range between 35°C and 45°C, thermophilic methanogens 55°C and hyperthermophilic species prefer temperatures up to 65°C (Ahring et al., 2001; Guneratnam et al., 2017). Other parameters influencing the activity of methanogens include pH (Ju et al., 2008), pH favorable for methanogens is neutral (see Table 3), narrower optimum depends on individual species (Varel et al., 1980). Concentrations and availability of macro– and micronutrients are also important (Demirel and Scherer, 2011). The individual metabolic pathways and their coupling are shown in Figs. 1–3 (Costa and Leigh, 2014; Galagan, 2002; Thauer, 2012). For the conversion of CO2 and H2, hydrogenotrophic methanogens are key microorganisms. 2.1.1 Hydrogenotrophic methanogens Hydrogenotrophic methanogens have been known for a long time and they are present in some amount in each microbial culture found in the anaerobic fermenters. The activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens is very important for the stability of the whole process because they metabolize hydrogen and CO2 to methane and thus maintain the hydrogen concentration at such level that allows stable acetogenesis resulting from the activity of syntrophic acetogenic microorganisms, which are very sensitive to higher concentrations of hydrogen (Eq. (1)) (1) CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COO – + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COO – + H + + 2 H 2 Δ G 0 ´ = 48.3 kJ / mol Thus, in order to produce acetic acid, it is necessary to keep the hydrogen pressure in the system at a low level (5.82Pa under standard conditions). To reduce CO2, not only hydrogen, but also formic acid and some alcohols are used as electron donors. CO2 reduction takes place as a so-called Wolfe cycle of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in several steps (Fig. 1) (Thauer, 2012). Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis starts with the reduction of CO2 to the formyl group of methanofuran (formyl-MFR), ferredoxin (Fd) as electron carrier is involved in following reactions (Eqs. (2)–(4)) (Kaster et al., 2011; Martin, 2012; Stojanowic and Hedderich, 2004). (2) CO 2 + H 2 + MFR → formyl − MFR + H 2 O Δ G 0 ´ = 20 kJ / mol (3) H 2 + Fd ox → Fd red 2 − + 2 H + Δ G 0 ´ = 16 kJ / mol (4) Fd red 2 − + 2 H + + CO 2 + MFR → Fd ox + formyl − MFR + H 2 O Δ G 0 ´ = 0 kJ / mol Subsequently, the formyl group is transported to the electron carrier tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) and dehydrated to methenyltetrahydromethanopterin (methenyl-H4MPT). The electron donor reduces the electron carrier F420 to F420H2 using hydrogenases, dehydrogenases and alcohol dehydrogenases. F420H2 then serves as a reductant for the second step – the reduction of methylene-H4MPT to methylene-H4MPT and further to methyl-H4MPT. The methyl group is then transported to the further electron carrier, sulfhydryl coenzyme M (HS-CoM), and reduced to CH4 with simultaneous oxidation of HS-CoM and HS-CoB to form CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfide. The subsequent electron bifurcation takes place in heterodisulfide reductase complex, reducing the CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfide to regenerated HS-CoM and HS-CoB and oxidized forms of Fdox to Fdred 2−, which is involved into the reduction of CO2 in the first step of the whole cycle. The reduction of CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfide to the regenerated HS-CoM and HS-CoB energetically compensates for the deficiency of energy in formyl-MFR formation reaction (Eq. (5)) (Kaster et al., 2011; Martin, 2012; Thauer, 2012). (5) H 2 + CoM − S − S − CoM → HS − CoM + HS − CoB Δ G 0 ´ = − 55 kJ / mol Hydrogenotrophic methanogens can use hydrogen not only to reduce CO2, but also to the utilization of CO. It is first oxidized to CO2, which is subsequently reduced in the presence of hydrogen to CH4 (Eq. (6)) (Guneratnam et al., 2017). (6) 3H 2 + CO → CH 4 + H 2 O For the rate of the methane formation from CO2, the H2 concentration, the activity and the number of hydrogenotrophic methanogens are important, which can be enriched by feeding H2 into the bioreactor and creating better conditions for their growth. The relationship of reaction rate with Gibbs energy and hydrogen concentration at Methanobacterium bryantii M.o.H. was investigated. Unlike previous work, it was found that the reaction is also going on at zero or positive ΔG and concluded that H2 threshold is controlled by a separate reaction other than methane production; electrons from H2 oxidation are bound to some solid part of the cell (Karadagli and Rittmann, 2005, 2007a, 2007b). 2.1.2 Acetotrophic methanogens Acetotrophic (acetoclastic) methanogens metabolize acetic acid to methane and carbon dioxide. The most abundant acetotrophs are microorganisms of the family Methanosarcinaceae and Methanosaetaceae. Their presence is negatively influenced among other by the concentration of NH3 and volatile fatty acids (VFA) (El-Mashad et al., 2004), an inhibition is caused by their non-dissociated forms. Methanosarcinaceae predominate at high concentrations of these compounds (manure digesters), but their number decreases with lower concentrations of NH3 and VFA (sewage sludge digesters), where Methanosaetaceae prevail. In general, filamentous acetotrophic methanogens are much more sensitive to ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and VFA concentrations than hydrogenotrophic methanogens or the acetotrophic family Methanosarcinaceae (Karakashev et al., 2005). Methanosarcinaceae occur in the form of irregular clumps that can protect them from unfavorable conditions. Methanosaeta spp. predominates at low concentrations of acetic acid and in granular sludge, whereas Methanosarcina spp. prevails at high concentrations of acetic acid and in flocculated sludge (Shin et al., 2001; Zheng and Raskin, 2000). Comparing the occurrence of acetotrophs under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, it was found that hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetotrophic methanogens of genus Methanosarcinaceae were predominant at higher temperatures, whereas Methanosaeta has not been observed under thermophilic conditions. Hydrogen concentration also plays an important role, as acetotrophic methanogens can compete with homoacetogens (Demirel and Scherer, 2008). The state of reactor operation is also a significant factor influencing the occurrence of individual acetotrophic methanogens. During the start-up procedure of the reactor for pig slurry processing, both genes were present, after reaching stable state the number of Methanosarcina reduced from 3.8% to 1.2% (expressed in % of 16rRNA), while Methanosaeta concilii remained at 2.2% (Angenent et al., 2002). The same change in microbial composition was observed during successful start-up of the reactor for OFMSW (organic fraction of municipal solid wastes) and activated sludge, Methanosaeta concilii became the predominant acetotroph (McMahon et al., 2001). Also in the reactor treating waste activated sludge (WAS) at 33°C and pH7 with the longer hydraulic retention time (HRT 28days) and low acetic acid concentration, Methanosaetaceae family predominated (Yu et al., 2005). In general, Methanosarcinaceae predominate in the flocs of acetotrophic methanogens, at high concentrations of acetic acid, under thermophilic conditions, and in the case of reactors instability. Methanosaetaceae, on the other hand, prevail under mesophilic conditions in the form of granular sludge at lower concentrations of acetic acid in well operated reactors (Demirel and Scherer, 2008). 2.1.3 Methylotrophic methanogens In the microbial culture of hydrogenotrophic methanogens catalyzing the reduction of CO2 to methane, the method of conservation of energy and electron fluxes has been recently specified and basic differences between two metabolic types of methanogens, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic are identified. These findings help to elucidate the metabolic versatility of methanogenic cultures and open the potential for engineering use of methanogens in new technologies (Costa and Leigh, 2014). Methylotrophic methanogens can metabolize C1-substrates. Metabolic pathways of methylotrophic methanogens are shown in Fig. 3. Besides methanol, formic acid, methylamines and methylsulfides, they can also metabolize some methylated ethanolamines (N,N,N-trimethylethanolamine and N,N-dimethylethanolamine). They are first demethylated by Methanococcoides spp. to ethanolamines, which are then used by some Clostridium spp. and sulfate-reducing bacteria, e.g., Desulfofrigus (Watkins et al., 2012). By the same way, it is possible to metabolize N,N,N-trimethylglycine by Methanococcoides spp. according to Eqs. (7)–(11) (Watkins et al., 2014). (7) 4 CH 3 3 N + CH 2 COO – + 2 H 2 O → 4 CH 3 2 NH + CH 2 COO – + 3 CH 4 + CO 2 − 721.7 kJ / reaction (8) 4 CH 3 3 N + CH 2 COO – + 6 H 2 O → 4 H 3 N + CH 2 COO – + 9 CH 4 + 3 CO 2 − 992.8 kJ / reaction (9) 2 CH 3 2 NH + CH 2 COO – + 2 H 2 O → 2 H 3 N + CH 2 COO – + 3 CH 4 + CO 2 − 135.5 kJ / reaction (10) 4 CH 3 NH 2 + CH 2 COO – + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 3 N + CH 2 COO – + 3 CH 4 + CO 2 − 157.7 kJ / reaction (11) 4 CH 3 NH 3 + + 2 H 2 O → 4 NH 4 + + 3 CH 4 + CO 2 − 172.1 kJ / reaction"
6,Homoacetogenic microorganisms,"2.2 Homoacetogenic microorganisms Homoacetogenic microorganisms can compete with hydrogenotrophic methanogens as they utilize hydrogen to reduce CO2 to acetic acid according to Eq. (12) (Demirel and Scherer, 2008). (12) HCO 3 – + 2H 2 + 0 . 5H + → 0 . 5CH 3 COO – + 2H 2 O When the system was not limited by hydrogen concentration, homoacetogenesis was observed mainly under psychrophilic conditions, because homoacetogens are better adapted to lower temperatures than the hydrogenotrophic methanogens and are able to use in addition to hydrogen the wide range of substrates (Kotsyurbenko et al., 2001). Under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, homoacetogens generated less energy (ΔG=−18 to −48kJ/mol) in comparison with hydrogenotrophic methanogens (ΔG=−67 to −98kJ/mol), making them unable to compete with methanogens on substrate H2/CO2 (Conrad and Klose, 1999). Under thermophilic conditions, homoacetogens can even change their metabolism and instead of forming acetic acid, they metabolize it to H2/CO2 that then serves as a substrate for hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which have more thermophilic homologs than the acetotrophic methanogens and therefore predominate in the culture."
7,Methods of biogas upgrading to biomethane,"Methods for increasing CH4 concentration in biogas to increase its calorific value or upgrading biogas to biomethane can be based on the following procedures: 1. Modification of anaerobic fermentation technology. 2. Removal of CO2 and other minor or trace biogas components (water vapor, siloxanes, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, oxygen, nitrogen). 3. Conversion of CO2 in biogas to biomethane that is possible to realize - by chemical reaction with H2 (Sabatier reaction), - by biochemical reaction with H2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens, - supplying electrons - bioelectrochemical systems (BES)."
8,Modification of anaerobic fermentation technology,"3.1 Modification of anaerobic fermentation technology Pressure anaerobic fermentation uses the fact that CO2 is much more soluble in liquids than CH4 at the given pressure. In the designed two-phase pressurized anaerobic fermentation technology, the activity of methanogenic bacteria increases pressure up to 100bar and produce biogas in almost natural gas quality that can be introduced into the grid. No additional chemicals or compression are needed. Research studies have achieved CH4 concentration of up to 85% at operating pressure of up to 10bar with continuous operation and 95% at the pressure of 90bar in batch tests (Merkle et al., 2015). By increasing pressure, the process of methanogenesis has not been inhibited, and it is obvious that increasing the pressure, higher CH4 concentrations in biogas can be achieved, thus replacing the biogas upgrading technologies used, but further research and optimization of the process are needed."
9,CO2 removal from biogas by physicochemical methods,"3.2 CO2 removal from biogas by physicochemical methods The result of biogas upgrading to biomethane by CO2 removal is the higher calorific value of the gas (Wobbe Index). During removal of CO2 also other pollutants in biogas are removed, especially H2S, and biomethane has no further harmful effects on the technological and distribution facilities. The undesirable minor components of biogas that need to be removed are mainly water vapor and hydrogen sulfide. Water vapor is mainly corrosive to the equipment by reaction with hydrogen sulfide, CO2 and ammonia. In addition to corrosive effects, hydrogen sulfide also has toxic effects not only on human health but also on anaerobic culture, mainly acetogenic microorganisms and methanogens. CO2 is not a minor component, depending on the substrate used; its content in biogas is 20–50%, so it decreases the calorific value of biogas. For the upgrading of biogas into biomethane and its injection into a natural gas grid or vehicle use, known methods are already widespread in practice. They are based on the physicochemical or chemical principles of CO2 removal – cryogenic separation, membrane separation, scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and high pressure water scrubbing (Yousef et al., 2016). Scrubbing with various washing liquids – water, glycols, amines etc. - has a high efficiency and, in addition to removing CO2, eliminates other minor components of biogas, methane loss is low (<2%) because of its low solubility. However, the investment and operating costs are very high. The use of molecular sieve or membrane technology, in addition to high investment costs, has the disadvantage of larger methane losses and in the case of membranes also low membrane selectivity. Cryogenic separation is not efficient enough and it is very expensive, but it does not require the excessive cost of biomethane compression. In general, physicochemical methods are very efficient but expensive technologies requiring complex technical equipment and showing some methane losses. Due to different requirements for these parameters, these technologies vary depending on the country that uses them. E.g. in Sweden it is preferred water scrubbing, in Germany PSA and in Denmark water scrubbing, PSA or membrane technology (Ryckebosch et al., 2011). In the effort to simplify and reduce costs of CO2 removal, pressureless water scrubbing was designed that use wastewater from the primary settling tank as the scrubbing liquid. The simultaneous removal of H2S and CO2 takes place in a counter-current, pressureless absorption column. There is no need pumping because of the gravity gradient of water flow through the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which, together with the omission of biogas compression, greatly reduces operating costs. The water used also contains no oxygen that would contaminate the biomethane. The efficiency of this process is based on the relatively high ratio of liquid to gas and low solubility of methane in water. No chemicals are needed and the installation can be easily integrated into the waterline of the WWTP. The absorption liquid does not require regeneration because flows to aerobic biological treatment, where H2S and traces of dissolved CH4 are degraded by aerobic bacteria (de Godos et al., 2015)."
10,Conversion of CO2 to methane,"3.3 Conversion of CO2 to methane Biogas contains such portion of CO2 that is given by a number of available electrons in the molecule of the organic substance in substrate (equivalent to an average number of oxygen to a carbon atom), so its production in anaerobic fermentation cannot be avoided. Converting CO2 to methane with hydrogen is possible to gain more energetically valuable gas, as the volumetric content of energy in hydrogen is low (10.88MJ/m3) in comparison to methane (36MJ/m3). If we want to convert CO2 into biogas to CH4 chemically, the supply of hydrogen, proper conditions of pressure, temperature, catalyst and relatively expensive equipment are needed. The advantage is output already compressed biomethane. For biochemical reaction further reduction equivalents are needed that can be delivered from different sources; either as gaseous electrolytic hydrogen, hydrogen can be directly electrolyzed in the system or electrons are directly supplied into the system. Reducing equivalents can also come from the gases from the thermic treatment of organic waste and biomass (gasification and pyrolysis)."
11,Bioconversion of carbon dioxide to methane using hydrogen directly,"Hydrogen is used by hydrogenotrophic methanogens for CO2 reduction according to the reaction (Eq. (13)) (Leonzio, 2016; Luo and Angelidaki, 2012; Wise et al., 1978). (13) 4 H 2 + CO 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O ΔG ° = − 130.7 kJ / mol By introducing H2 and CO2 into a methanogenic culture, its composition begins to change and hydrogenotrophic methanogens predominate. This change in the composition of the population was recorded by many authors in batch experiments (Szuhaj et al., 2016), pulsed hydrogen dosing (Agneessens et al., 2017) and continuous processes (Kougias et al., 2017). The stoichiometric ratio of H2:CO2 =4:1 may not be enough to convert all of CO2 from biogas to methane because inoculum may contain bicarbonates, and to the excess of CO2 can contribute also CO2 produced from the residual organic substances contained in the inoculum (Luo and Angelidaki, 2012). Advantageously, it is possible to biologically utilize H2 or CO2 generated in other industrial productions, for example in the electronics industry, where the valuable gaseous fuel as a product is produced from the waste streams H2 and CO2 (Kim et al., 2013b). The process for biogas conversion to biomethane can be implemented in two basic ways, either by hydrogen supplying directly into the anaerobic fermenter “in-situ” or by means of the external bioreactor with the enriched culture of hydrogenotrophic methanogens “ex-situ” (Burkhardt and Busch, 2013; Kim et al., 2013a, 2013b; Peillex et al., 1990). The advantage of these methods is the possibility to use the existing technological and energy infrastructure of biogas plants and WWTPs and their implementation can be very fast."
12,Direct supply of hydrogen to anaerobic fermenter “in-situ”,"4.1 Direct supply of hydrogen to anaerobic fermenter “in-situ” The supply of hydrogen into the anaerobic fermenter as the biogas conversion method has two major limitations of the process - metabolic and physico-chemical. 4.1.1 Metabolic limitation Hydrogen supply may cause some problems due to the inhibitory effect of increased hydrogen partial pressure on the metabolism of butyric and propionic acid by syntrophic acetogens. This could lead to reduced efficiency in the decomposition of complex substrates (Siriwongrungson et al., 2007). During CO2 consumption, pH may rise significantly above 8, which again slows down some microbial processes. The growth rates of acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms are particularly influenced (Luo et al., 2012; O'Flaherty et al., 1998). The solution is chemical pH adjustment during the process (Kim et al., 2013a) or cofermentation with the substrate with low pH (Luo and Angelidaki, 2013a). In the last mentioned study, pH in the thermophilic anaerobic fermenter with the direct dosing of H2 was maintained in the range 7.7–7.9 by utilizing whey as a cosubstrate. As a result, all of the hydrogen dosed was almost completely converted to CH4 and there was no accumulation of fatty acids in the effluent. The addition of hydrogen had a clear positive effect on methanogenesis and no negative effect on acetogenesis. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity as well as the concentration of F420 co-enzyme increased. In the microbial consortium, Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum became significant. Although the concentration of dissolved hydrogen was increased in the system, the decomposition of propionic acid was still thermodynamically viable (Luo and Angelidaki, 2013a). Efforts to reduce metabolic limitations in further research led to the use of a two-stage system. In a system of two connected continuously stirred reactors, biogas produced in the first reactor passed to the second reactor, which was fed with H2 (Bassani et al., 2015). The substrate to the reactors was raw cattle manure, operating temperature was maintained at 55°C. The residence time was 15 and 20days in the first and the second reactors respectively. The authors observed the change in the microbial population at steady state before and after the addition of hydrogen. The results from the microbial analysis for the archaeal community were consistent with the reactor operation and proved the initial hypothesis that the methanogenic pathway would shift from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic after the H2 addition. More specifically, the abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (i.e. Methanobrevibacter spp., Methanoculleus spp. and the archaea with similarity to Methanobacterium) increased after the H2 addition, with a concomitant decrease in the abundance of the acetoclastic Methanosarcina spp. H2 was not entirely consumed, about 8.3% remained in the enriched biogas. Incomplete utilization of H2 is apparently due to the imperfect and slow mass transfer from the gaseous to the liquid phase. Similar problems with hydrogen dosing are reported by other authors (Guiot et al., 2015). In a two-stage system, even in the case of complete utilization of H2, residual CO2 in biomethane appears to be derived from the additional CO2 that is produced from the remaining undecomposed organic matter in the first stage or from bicarbonates. In the second stage microbial consortium, which responded to the addition of hydrogen by the change in composition, the amount of Clostridium and Actinobacterium species increased, with methanogens predominantly hydrogenotrophic such as Methanobrevibacter spp., Methanoculleus spp. (similar to M. thermophilus) and Methanobacterium. At the same time, the amount of Methanosarcinae ssp. decreased (Bassani et al., 2015). 4.1.2 Physico-chemical limitation The main barrier to the application of the biological removal of CO2 from a biogas is the mass transfer rate from the gas to the liquid phase and the low solubility of H2. Mass transport of gas to a liquid is a very important parameter, because, for the use of hydrogen by microorganisms, it must be dissolved in the liquid phase (Guiot et al., 2011). The mass transfer coefficient, as well as the solubility of hydrogen, decreases with increasing temperature, which is a problem, especially in thermophilic reactor, because the hydrogenotrophic microbial consortia are the most active under thermophilic conditions. Mass transfer from gaseous to liquid phase is possible to control by the particular dose rate of gas, the type of dosing equipment and the intensity of mixing. Method for the conversion of hydrogen and CO2 to biomethane in situ is simple, effective, but it is necessary to compensate the negative effect of increasing pH and to secure distribution of required hydrogen feed so that it is all consumed."
13,Direct supply of hydrogen to external bioreactor “ex-situ”,"4.2 Direct supply of hydrogen to external bioreactor “ex-situ” Due to the metabolic limitations of the addition of hydrogen to the fermenter, further research has been focused also on external bioreactors, into which only CO2 or biogas is supplied as a substrate together with hydrogen and where special conditions can be created to necessary hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The rate of hydrogen transfer into the liquid phase again proved to be a limiting factor, this parameter can be expressed by Eq. (14). (14) r t = 22.4 k L a H 2 gTh − H 2 l rt is the rate of hydrogen transfer from gas to liquid - L/(L·d), H2gTh – theoretic value of hydrogen solubility by Henry's law, H2l – measured dissolved hydrogen, kLa – coefficient of hydrogen transfer to the liquid phase. The value of kLa is possible to increase by mixing and proper equipment for a gas introduction to the reactor. As demonstrated, the increasing of the agitation rate from 500 to 800rpm allowed to increase reactor loading rate from 6 to 24L/(L·d) and to achieve 90% methane content in biogas, maintaining pH7.8 (Luo and Angelidaki, 2012). Under thermophilic conditions (55°C), the conversion rate of CO2 and H2 to 320mL/(g·h) (CH4/VS) can be achieved, which is 60% more than in mesophilic conditions. A continuous supply of the mixture of biogas and hydrogen (6L/(L·d)) to the thermophilic reactor provided biogas with 95% CH4. To improve the transfer of hydrogen to the liquid phase and to prevent the presence of unused hydrogen in biomethane, membrane modules can be used for gas dosing. The use of hollow fiber membranes for hydrogen dosing was tested in the study of Wang et al., 2013 with maintaining the pH8.0, so there was no negative influence on the process. The gas permeation through the membrane can be decreased by biofilm growth on the membranes that consume from 22 to 36% of hydrogen; the rest is consumed in the liquid. In the culture, the homoacetogenic genus Treponema and the hydrogenotrophic genus Methanoculleus dominated, indicating both the direct conversion of H2 to CH4 by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and indirect conversion through homoacetogenic acetic acid formation (Eq. (15)) and its subsequent conversion to CH4 by acetotrophic methanogens. (15) 4H 2 + 2HCO 3 – + H + → CH 3 COO – + 4H 2 O Interesting is the dominance of acetoclastic Methanosaeta species in the biofilm on the membranes, where apparently prevailed indirect hydrogen conversion (Luo and Angelidaki, 2013b). The potential of the membrane hollow fiber bioreactor for the conversion of H2 and CO2 to CH4 was also evaluated in the study of Díaz et al. (2015). The bioreactor was operated at 55°C, the membrane module with 232 polymer hollow fiber had the area of 0.93m2. Biogas was recirculated from the reactor gas space to the membrane module, to reach adequate mixing also the recirculation of liquid was introduced. The efficiency of hydrogen conversion in the system depends on hydrogen loading rate of the reactor and intensity of both recirculations. The system was able to transform 95% of input hydrogen at loading rate 40L/(L·d) and thermophilic conditions with the production of 0.22–0.23L CH4 per L of dosed hydrogen. The concentration of dissolved hydrogen was under detection limit in all experiments, it means, all hydrogen crossing the membrane was consumed. For transfer of H2 from inner membrane space to the liquid phase, the mass transfer coefficient kLa 430h−1was found out. The simulated optimal capacity of hydrogen introduced to the reactor 25L/(L·d) was determined for the output biomethane quality of 95% CH4. The ratio of recirculation flow to input flow Qr/Qin 1.75 to 2.25 is needed to reach the concentration of 95% CH4 that is the maximum obtained in the study. Results proved the possibility of effective hydrogen dosing to liquid by means of membranes in pilot scale at the loading rate applicable even in full-scale operation (Díaz et al., 2015). VFA concentrations were low during the whole experiment and they are probably a result of decomposition of dead cells and endogenous activity or homoacetogenic production of acetic acid from indirect transformation to CH4, as was shown in a similar experiment (Wang et al., 2013). Due to the importance of hydrogen sufficient input into the reactor, further studies (Bassani et al., 2017) dealt with the comparison of different ways of the hydrogen dispersion efficiency in the system. Gaseous substrates were dosed to four thermophilic reactors by means of diffusers from stainless steel, ceramic sponge or ceramic membrane. The influence of different pore size (0.4–2μm), gases loading rates and gases recirculation rates to process efficiency was investigated. The large pore size in diffusors brings better kinetics, higher flow of recirculated gas also caused a positive effect, and biomethane reached the quality of 96% CH4. Microbial analyses show a remarkable increase in the occurrence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum being the most frequent. The growth of syntrophic bacteria Thermoanaerobacteriales and Syntrophomonadaceae or Anaerobaculum mobile proved selection effect of H2 to create microbial community preferring hydrogenotrophic metabolic pathway. The technology of CO2 conversion can be applied not only to biogas upgrade but also for biomethane production from different sources of waste streams of CO2. Authors (Savvas et al., 2015) investigated the efficiency of biomethane production and nutrition demand from CO2 and H2 in a mesophilic bioreactor with recirculation of biomass and no nutrient addition. During the experiment no decrease of activity was observed, the recycling and decomposition of unnecessary bacterial biomass provide the necessary nutrients needed to the maintenance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens during six months of the reactor operation. Seifert et al. (2013) tested the influence of the input gas composition and the occurrence of other gases besides H2 and CO2 on the efficiency of the conversion to biomethane. They investigated biogas, gases from ethanol fermentation, captured CO2 after removing by PSA. Experiments were carried out with the culture of Methanothermobacter marburgensis and no negative effect of accompanying gases was observed. Effects of gassing rate, the pressure in the reactor and its design on the efficiency of methanogenesis were also studied during continuous operation. The rate of gassing influenced mainly volumetric methane production; the pressure in the reactor controlled output gas quality. They demonstrated how the combination of increased gas supply and elevated pressure in reactor influenced volumetric output and the quality of biomethane. The maximum biomethane concentration was only 85% and further research should focus on the engineering design of the reactor. Another variant of biomethane production from biogas can be the removal of CO2 by washing, and only the scrubbing liquid is fed to an external methanogenic bioreactor with hydrogen supply. 4.2.1 Types and construction of external bioreactors In external bioreactors, substrates are only gases (H2 and CO2), which are often fed into the fermentation liquid by different gas distribution systems. It depends greatly on the type of diffuser and the size of pores and thus the size of bubbles, as well as the ascending bubbles velocity (Bassani et al., 2017). If the gas-liquid contact time is not sufficient to dissolve all input hydrogen, the problem is solved by recirculation of the gaseous effluent. Bioreactors are usually designed as a column with the high ratio of height and width and they can be operated as mixing reactors with a mixer and a diffuser near the bottom and as fixed bed reactors with different materials as packing. Fixed bed reactors can be used mainly as an immersed filter or a trickling filter. In this type of reactors is very important type of packing and its specific surface. In the thermophilic reactor with diatomaceous ceramics particles of diameter 2–3mm as packed bed and with the culture of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH the biofilm dry density of 30mg/cm3, the conversion efficiency of 80% and the volumetric production of biomethane 5.2L/(L.h) were achieved (Jee et al., 1988). A similar material with a high specific surface (granular perlite and vermiculite) for packing of two fixed bed reactors serially connected was used by Alitalo et al. (2015). At the temperature of 53–55°C, the biomethane yield was 6.35m3/(m3·d) with hydrogen reactor load 25.5m3/(m3·d) and 100% conversion of H2. Efficiency was promoted by nutrient supplements. During the experiment, the process liquid recirculation for each reactor was introduced, but intermittently and for only 3% of reactors volume. In the study of Burkhardt and Busch (2013) the innovative type of reactor - the trickling filter with immobilized hydrogenotrophic methanogens under mesophilic conditions, was investigated. The bed space is not submerged, but the fluid in the recirculated stream tricks the surface of the carrier immobilized with microorganisms and forms a three-phase gas-liquid-biofilm system. In this system, there is a much better transfer of gases to biofilm, because there is a higher concentration gradient as the driving force for mass transfer and a short diffusion path. The construction of a reactor with a large interfacial surface area of the polymeric carrier allows for the improved transfer of gases to biofilm with methanogens and to obtain a higher conversion efficiency, at the optimum of reactor loading the biomethane production reached 1.17Nm3/(m3·d) (CH4). The thickness of the water layer on the carrier particles with the bacteria, as well as the thickness of the biofilm critical for the efficiency of the system is small. But there is some limitation given by the different solubility of hydrogen and CO2 and different diffusion coefficients. Burkhardt et al. (2015) carried out experiments with the continuous operation of this type of mesophilic reactor with high quality output (CH4 98%) with the load of 6Nm3/(m3·d) of hydrogen (calculated on the volume of the packing). At pH range 7.2–7.4 an average retention time was 4h and the reactor exhibited a plug flow character. To determine the effect of the liquid film thickness, the process fluid was recycled in the range from 3.35 to 13.5m3/(m3·d). The ratio of H2 to CO2 required for complete conversion was 3.76: 1, the required excess CO2 can be explained by the demand for carbon in increased biomass production. Hydrogen utilization was always about 100%, even at the maximum load of 4.83Nm3/(m3·d), methane production was correlated with the theoretical value. Production of CH4 reached 1.49Nm3/(m3·d). The character of the gas flow through the reactor has ensured an efficient process even without gas recirculation that was used in other works. The reactor configuration allows apply considerably higher loading by hydrogen and therefore to get the results that exceed 13 times the potential of other types of bioreactors. The next phase of the experiment included the introduction of biogas (77% CH4) instead of pure CO2; the H2 dose was stoichiometric and resulted in almost complete conversion of CO2 from biogas to biomethane and methane production increased by 23%. Anaerobic fermenter, which supplied the biogas in experiments, was directly linked to the trickling filter for the biomethane production with hydrogen at the mesophilic temperature, was investigated by Rachbauer et al. (2016). Because of the mesophilic temperature of the process, they did not achieve such production as for thermophilic reactors but confirmed the suitability of this type of biogas upgrading to biomethane to be directly connected to the anaerobic fermenter. The quality of biomethane met the criteria for using the natural gas grid and the volume production of methane reached 2.52Nm3/(m3·d). The importance of this work is in the processing and upgrading of the real produced biogas. Gas recirculation is a significant means of increasing mass transfer and production of biomethane even at larger scales, it is a key parameter especially for bubbled reactors (Kougias et al., 2017). Efforts to increase the productivity of mixed or membrane reactors have led to the inclusion of intense mixing, which, however, consumes a considerable amount of energy and is only feasible on a small scale due to the limited technical capabilities of large propeller mixers. Four types of upflow reactors were used to compare the efficiency of the reactors: a column type upflow reactor with a diffusor at the bottom as a single-stage or two-stage reactor, where the process liquid and the gas from the first stage were recirculated to the second stage, further the intensively stirred reactor, and the high bubbled column (Kougias et al., 2017). Digestate was used as the source of nutrients. The concentration of CH4 in the output gas was the highest in serially connected reactors (>98%). The gas recirculation rate also has a positive effect on the efficiency of the process. 4.2.2 Bioreactors inoculation As inoculum to external bioreactors can be used pure cultures, enriched cultures or directly anaerobic sludge from fermenters from WWTPs where the presence of Methanococcus spp., Methanobacterium spp., Methanomicrobium a Methanosaeta spp. were confirmed. The culture from the biogas plant fermenter was used by Luo and Angelidaki (2013a). Adaptation and enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in reactors take place during the start-up procedure (Burkhardt et al., 2015). In the study of Díaz et al. (2015), the inoculation of the hollow fiber membrane bioreactor with thermophilic anaerobic sludge from WWTP was performed. The start-up procedure at 55°C with CO2 and H2 in the stoichiometric ratio at hydrogen load of 5m3/(m3·d) with recirculation of 0.1m3/d took 30days with the addition of micro and macro-nutrients and maintaining the pH at 7.2."
14,Bioconversion of CO2 to methane with other sources of reducing equivalents,
15,Conversion of CO2 from biogas to CH4 with hydrogen produced electrolytically directly in the fermenter,"5.1 Conversion of CO2 from biogas to CH4 with hydrogen produced electrolytically directly in the fermenter Tartakovsky et al. (2011a) tried to simplify electrolytic hydrogen gas dosing by performing the hydrogen production by electrolysis directly in the fermenter. Electrodes for hydrogen production by water electrolysis were installed directly into an anaerobic fermenter at the voltage of 2.8–3.5V without separating membrane, and simultaneous production of oxygen created microaerobic conditions for biogas desulphurization and hydrolysis support. Methane production from anaerobic wastewater treatment increased by 10–25% and the operational stability of the reactor increased. By optimizing the resistance in electrolytic hydrogen production, it is possible to significantly reduce the consumption of electricity (Tartakovsky et al., 2011b). In further research of Tartakovsky et al. (2014), the anaerobic co-fermentation of cattle manure and Panicum virgatum in a stirred reactor (CSTR) was electrolytically supported. Significant improvements in process efficiency and biogas quality were achieved at current densities of 20–25mA per L of reactor volume with a corresponding volume energy consumption of 0.07–0.08Wh. Methane production increased by 26% and H2S in biogas fell from 2500 to 3000ppm to <10ppm due to the microaerobic environment of the electrodes. Increased efficiency has been achieved by the production of methane from hydrolytic H2 and possibly increased hydrolysis of organic substrates. The bioelectrolytic process integrated into the fermenter, but with separate O2 production to limit O2 transfer, was compared to the fermenter with H2 dosing from an external electrolyzer, followed by the system of external biogas conversion to biomethane in a trickling biofilter inoculated with anaerobic sludge (Guiot et al., 2015). In the first two systems, output biomethane still contained 8% CO2 and 7% H2, but in the latter case, 100% conversion of CO2 and no hydrogen in effluent gas were achieved. Xu et al. (2014) investigated the comparison of electrolytic H2 production in situ and ex situ, and in this study, the process in situ has a better efficiency than ex situ. In both cases, the content of CO2 in biomethane was <10%. Molecular analysis of the microorganisms' composition in both systems showed the dominance of hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium petrolearium. The method of biogas upgrading to biomethane using electrolysis appears to be very promising with a wide potential for application. It is able to simply and efficiently use surplus electricity to form CH4 as a storable and transportable form of energy."
16,Conversion of CO2 in biogas by supplying electrons,"5.2 Conversion of CO2 in biogas by supplying electrons It has been found, that some methanogens, such as Methanobacterium palustre, are able to reduce CO2 to methane by direct electricity delivery. So, as the source of electrons to methanogens may serve not only hydrogen but these microorganisms can use electrons directly from an electrode to reduce CO2 to CH4 (Eq. (16)) (Cheng et al., 2009). (16) CO 2 + 8H 2 + 8e − → CH 4 + 2H 2 O However, the molecular mechanism of this reaction has not yet been fully elucidated. Although several studies have already illustrated that methanogens can directly use protons and electrons, there is still the possibility that this pathway is the rapid development of molecular hydrogen that is immediately consumed by hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Eq. (17)) to reduce CO2 (Sato et al., 2013). (17) 2H + + 2e − → H 2 Anaerobic decomposition of organic substances is their gradual oxidation with the simultaneous removal of electrons. The transfer of electrons takes place through the chain of redox reactions, which are mediated by redox enzymes – biocatalysts. Direct bioelectrocatalysis transfers electrons from the active site of the enzyme to the electrode without any mediators. The Bioelectrochemical System (BES) can be used either to produce electrical energy from the decomposition of substrates or to support biochemical reactions by supplying electricity (Karyakin, 2012). In dual chamber BES microbes in the anode space oxidize substrates and transfer released electrons to the anode, these are led to the cathode where they are used by other microbes to reduce CO2 to CH4, the process is called electromethanogenesis. Recent studies have dealt with electromethanogenesis in the biocathodes separately or as part of BES, but it has not yet been fully elucidated how biocathode and bioanode interact. In the study of Dykstra and Pavlostathis (2015), three cultures were tested in the BES: stored culture with the abiotic cathode, bioanode culture with the abiotic cathode, and bioanode with biocathode. Biocathode culture consisted of the enriched culture of hydrogenotrophic methanogens from a standard laboratory model fed with H2/CO2 (80/20) mixture, the biocathodes were working at the voltage of −1V. CH4 production in the biocathode is affected by the concentration of the substrate in the anode (CO2 production) and the availability of CO2 in the cathodic space. The effectiveness of a complete BES will depend on the CO2 flow that appears to be limiting for conversion to CH4. Guo et al. (2013) carried out batch tests in the single-chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) without a membrane to research bioelectrochemical support for the production of hydrogen and consequently methane in the anaerobic fermentation of sewage sludge. They compared the results with the same system without the power supply. Both hydrogen and methane were produced in both systems, but electrochemical support led to an increase in hydrogen production from 1.7 to 5.2 times, methane production from 11.4 to 13.6 times. They used Ti/Ru electrodes and voltages of 1.4 and 1.8V. The applied voltage increased the removal of organic suspended solids, promoted solubilization, accelerated the conversion of lower fatty acids and maintained optimal pH for methanogens. The reactor with microbial electrolysis cell represents the direct integration of bioelectrochemical systems into the fermenter. By connecting the microbial electrolysis cell to the anaerobic fermentation in a single-chamber reactor, methane concentration of 98% was achieved and the yield increased 2.3 times compared to the reference reactor (Booth, 2009; Kotsyurbenko et al., 2001; Tartakovsky et al., 2011a). Batlle-Vilanova et al. (2015) proposed promising option of conversion CO2 captured during the water scrubbing of biogas to CH4 by the bioelectrochemical system. BES uses less energy, preferably excess electrical energy than is consumed during regeneration of scrubbing liquid by air stripping. Biological electromethanogenesis is a promising technology that is also applicable to the conversion of geologically stored CO2 to CH4 using electroactive microorganisms as biocatalysts. To obtain the biocatalyst applicable to CO2 reservoirs, a microbial fuel cell (MFC) was used to enrich electrochemically active microorganisms from the sample of liquid from oil reservoirs. The maximum current density of the thermophilic MFC was about 1003mW/m2, higher than previously reported, suggesting that subsurface oil reservoirs hide highly active biocatalysts (Fu et al., 2013). Anaerobic fermentation at lower temperatures is an advantageous technology, especially in the mild climates. However, the low fermentation temperature is associated with low microbial activity and low methane production rates. Liu et al. (2016) investigated possible influence of the bioelectrochemical system on increasing the efficiency of the anaerobic fermentation at low temperatures. The electrodes were made from granulated activated carbon and the bioelectrochemical system at the cathode potential of −0.9V (Ag/AgCl) coupled to anaerobic fermentation at 10°C was able to increase methane production up to 6.6 times compare to the reference reactor, further accelerate methane production and acetic acid consumption. CH4 production at 10°C was only slightly lower compared to electrically unsupported the anaerobic fermentation at 30°C."
17,Reducing equivalents from products of gasification and pyrolysis,"5.3 Reducing equivalents from products of gasification and pyrolysis When listing the perspectives of new technologies using specific skills of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, it is necessary to mention also the possibility to couple anaerobic fermentation and treatment of gases from the thermic processing of biomass and hardly decomposable organic waste. Anaerobic fermentation and gasification with pyrolysis are two basic technology sectors that convert the energy of organic waste and various types of biomass into a more usable gaseous form. Both of these methods are similar in the fact that not all components of the product gases are energy carriers and the main contaminant is CO2. Both gases have local limitations as to the full utilization of energy potential. However, the gas from gasification or pyrolysis of biomass - syngas - has a slightly different composition than biogas and the energy carriers are mainly H2 and CO with CO2 as an accompanying component (Han et al., 2015). Of course, syngas can be used for direct combustion or in cogeneration unit and produce heat used for drying of input materials or heating the pyrolysis reactor, but local conditions are not always favorable for the full utilization of the energy potential same as for biogas. Syngas is not suitable for storage and is not compatible with the natural gas grid. For the possibility of converting syngas to methane, there are already procedures of thermal chemical synthesis, which are again challenging to the reaction conditions and the quality of the device. Chemical methanisation of syngas is based on reaction with water to increase the H2/CO ratio and nickel-catalyzed reduction of CO and CO2 to CH4. The reaction requires high pressures and temperatures, and the catalyst is prone to poisoning (Aresta et al., 2016). Disadvantages and demands of chemical conversion can be eliminated by using the biological conversion of syngas to methane using hydrogenotrophic methanogens and anaerobic fermentation technology. This method does not require high pressures and temperatures, or the expensive equipment of the chemical industry, and thus the refined biogas can already have, with or without modification, the quality of the biomethane with all the benefits of using the natural gas distribution system. 5.3.1 Biomethane from syngas Anaerobic technological culture has considerable carboxydotrophic methanogenic potential - the ability to consume CO as a substrate without special adaptations of the culture (Guiot et al., 2011). Syngas is fed into an anaerobic fermenter, where its components with reductive equivalents (H2, CO) are used in the biological conversion of CO2 from syngas and CO2 from biogas to other CH4. Other indirect reactions such as carboxydotrophic hydrogen production (Henstra et al., 2007) followed by methanogenic reduction of CO2 or CO, homoacetogenesis from CO followed by acetotrophic methanogenesis, oxidation of CO to formic acid followed by its reduction to CH4 are taking place in the mixed culture. Regardless of the type of specific reaction, the yield of methane is 0.25mol of CH4 per mole of CO, plus 0.25mol of CH4 per mole of H2. Based on the usual concentrations of CO and H2 in the syngas (CO from 30 to 60%, H2 from 25 to 60% and CO2 from 35 and 3%), 0.2 to 0.4Nm3/kg (CH4gasified organic solids) can be obtained, if syngas is fed into the anaerobic fermenter and effectively dissolved (Guiot et al., 2015). Anaerobic culture also has a certain tolerance to impurities commonly found in syngas such as HCN, NH3, H2S, aromatic hydrocarbons, however, depending on the syngas dose and the bioactivity of the culture. Significant negative effects do not occur to 500ppm for NH3, 1ppm for aromatics, 15ppm for HCN and 50ppm for H2S (Guiot et al., 2015). However, it is likely that in order to optimize the process, it will be necessary to partially purify the syngas before bioconversion. Its bioconversion can be carried out, just like with hydrogen, directly in the anaerobic fermenter or in external bioreactors whose utilization so far prevails. 5.3.2 Reactors for syngas conversion In the study of Guiot et al. (2015), the conversion of CO to CH4 and the mass transfer efficiency in three types of high performance anaerobic reactors - fluid bed reactor (FBR), the closed loop gas-lift reactor (GLR), and bubbling column (BCR) were investigated. With the active microbial culture in the reactor, the coefficient of gas transfer (kLa) from 1 to 6h−1 was found. For comparison, the mixed anaerobic reactor (CSTR) exhibited kLa of about 20h−1. The bubbled column inoculated with anaerobic granules was operated >189days with CO flow (100% CO, 164kPa) over 7L/d and gas recirculation rate above 1200L/d. The maximum volume activity of 62.4mmol/(L·d) corresponds to the specific activity of the culture of 10mmol/(g·d) (CO/VSS) and was achieved at the load of 22L/d at 85% CO transformation efficiency. The residence time of the gas was 1day and the average methane yield was 26±2% mol/mol (CH4/CO). The volume activity of CO consumption in BCR was double compared to GLR, which was also inoculated with anaerobic granules and has similar specific activities. Under the same conditions of CO loading rate (15–20mmol/(L·d)), CSTR was more limited, probably due to lower CO tolerance in a fine suspension culture than in a granular culture in BCR. 5.3.3 Combination of anaerobic technology and thermic processes – gasification and pyrolysis Some organic waste such as sludge, slurry or manure is only partially used in anaerobic fermentation and the unused portion of organic matter is 40–50%. If the digestate with remaining 50% of organic matter is dried and gasified into syngas which is reintroduced into the anaerobic fermentation, an increase in methane production of 20 to 50% can be expected depending on the efficiency of the anaerobic fermentation (Guiot et al., 2015). The aim of further studies was to explore the possibility of closer interconnection of anaerobic fermentation and pyrolysis and gasification not only for syngas but also other products of thermal processes to fully utilize the energy potential of agricultural waste and increase the sustainability of biogas plants (Henstra et al., 2007). In biogas plants, agricultural waste is converted to biogas and digestate, which is produced in large quantities. The results show that heat produced only from anaerobic fermentation can cover the consumption of digestate drying for consequently subjected to pyrolysis. Adding the energy of the syngas obtained (calorific value 15.7MJ/Nm3) and pyrolysis oil (combustion heat 23.5MJ/kg) it is obtained from the combined system 42% more energy than from the fermentation itself. To improve the process of pyrolysis even pelletizing has been included after drying of digestate caused 42% more power than the fermentation (Monlau et al., 2015). Anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW), which represents about 30% of municipal solid waste, can be improved by introducing gasification of the difficult degradable fraction and by the biomethanization of the produced syngas with the expected yield of 0.3Nm3/kg (CH4/gasified solids). The total methane production would be several times higher than only OFMSW fermentation. Moreover, the combination of anaerobic fermentation and gasification in one technological unit with the ultimate goal of producing biomethane brings savings in both investment and operating costs. For example, the anaerobic fermentation of a slightly decomposable part of OFMSW does not require intensive hydrolysis as a pre-treatment of the part that can be gasified without difficulty. Solid digestate, if it cannot be sold as a fertilizer, can also be processed in a gasifier yielding additional methane instead of being deposited. Anaerobic fermentation unit will make it possible to fully replace the chemical catalytic treatment of syngas to methane (Guiot et al., 2015). The combination of anaerobic fermentation of food waste and biomethanization of syngas has been studied in CSTR with the residence time of 28days and the organic loading of VSS from 1 to 2g/(L·d). The maximum conversion rate 12mmol/g (CO, VSS) was achieved with a gas residence time of 0.04d−1. The ratio of CO to waste expressed as COD is very important, it indicates the level of parallel decomposition of organic substances in wastes. The best CO/waste ratio was 0.4g/g with a CH4 yield of 0.5Nm3/kg of distributed organic waste (Guiot et al., 2015). Gasification and pyrolysis of biomass also produce liquid and solid components besides the gas, their proportions being dependent on the conditions of the thermal process. The solid component - biochar - contains mainly carbon and has the properties of the absorbent and can also be used in the anaerobic fermentation process. Gasification and pyrolysis technologies are applied to organic materials or wastes whose components are little or very difficult biodegradable. The integration of anaerobic fermentation and gasification is the simplification of the technological line able to process a wide range of waste with minimal residual material and it is in the scheme in Fig. 4 (Fabbri and Torri, 2016). The yield of pyrolysis depends on the nature of the feed material, the pyrolysis temperature, the heating rate and the residence time, and substantially on the type and construction of the pyrolysis reactor. Authors examined temperatures of 400, 500 and 600°C. By increasing the pyrolysis temperature the proportion of H2 and CO in the syngas and their ratio (H2/CO) increase. The calorific value of syngas is from 9.5 to 15.7MJ/Nm3 in dependence to pyrolysis temperature. Biochar can be used as an additional source of energy after burning, soil quality improvement and cheap adsorbent. Use in soil increases the retention of water and nutrients (Fabbri and Torri, 2016). Other authors tested pyrolysis of digestate from pig slurry with the addition of sawdust and pre-composting. Pyrolysis was carried out at 600°C. The addition of sawdust increased the calorific value of both the syngas and the biochar and reduced it in the liquid fraction. Composting increases the calorific value of bio-oil and lowers it in the biochar, and affects the yield only from digestate or with a small amount of sawdust added otherwise the overall energy yield decreases (Troy et al., 2013). 5.3.4 Biomethane from biochar The design of the process that produces the biomethane quality of natural gas by anaerobic thermophilic fermentation of sludge with the addition of corn stalk pyrolysis biochar is very interesting (Shen et al., 2015). Biochar has the high specific surface area (150m2/g) with high ash content (45.2% dry matter) and high concentration of potassium, calcium and magnesium (14.2% K2O, 3.9% CaO and 4.2% MgO in ash). The biochar enriched fermenter produces biomethane with >90% methane and <5ppb H2S and removes CO2 from 86.3%. The addition of biochar increases the total production of biomethane by 42% against the reference reactor without the biochar, increases alkalinity and reduces the inhibition of ammonia and ensures the stable operation of thermophilic fermentation. The biochar doses were from 1.82 to 3.64g/g of sludge dry matter. Digestate from fermentation with the biochar is enriched with nutrients (potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus) and is suitable for soil amendment. The proposed process is simple and efficient and biogas production and its treatment to biomethane take place in a single reactor at normal fermentation pressures. It reduces upgrading costs and in addition, produces usable high quality fertilizer and means to improve soil quality."
18,Conclusions,"Bioconversion of carbon dioxide to biomethane in anaerobic fermentation using electrolytic hydrogen or direct electric current actually combines current guidelines of Environmental Protection - treatment of organic waste, the use of CO2 captured and troubleshooting fluctuations in electricity production from alternative sources. In the microbial culture of hydrogenotrophic methanogens catalyzing the reduction of CO2 to methane, the method of energy conservation and electron fluxes has been recently specified and basic differences between two metabolic types of methanogens, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic are identified. These findings help to elucidate the metabolic versatility of methanogenic cultures and bring the potential for engineering use of methanogens in new technologies. Technological applications of carbon dioxide and hydrogen bioconversion to biomethane represent a wide range of different types of reactors, where the main problem is the transfer of gases into the liquid, ensuring a sufficient supply of substrates for methanogenesis. Different systems of dosing of gases in combination with the type of reactor have been tested which differ in both principle and efficiency, but further research is still needed in this respect. Although there are already several full-scale applications of anaerobic fermentation with CO2 conversion to biomethane, no complex technological solution yet can be considered as optimal. As a source of electron equivalents for hydrogenotrophic methanogens does not only hydrogen serve, but they can use electrons directly to reduce CO2 to CH4. Biological electromethanogenesis is a promising technology that is applicable to the conversion of CO2 to CH4 using electroactive microorganisms as a biocatalyst. However, the molecular mechanism of this reaction has not yet been fully elucidated. Utilizing the metabolic potential of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic cultures for processing and upgrading other gases such as syngas to biomethane is a promising prospect for increasing energy utilization from non-traditional sources."
