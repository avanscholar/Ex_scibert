0,Introduction,"Internal combustion engines (ICEs) have received extensive attention as a significant source of environmental pollution and energy consumption. It is therefore imperative to promote the combustion strategy innovation of advanced ICEs accompanied by the continuous development and effective utilization of biofuels [1]. Bio-alcohol fuels, as a renewable resource, possess the characteristics of self-supplying oxygen which have superiorities in low pollutant emissions, cost-efficiency and safe storage compared with conventional diesel and gasoline [2]. Alcohols, especially ethanol, are increasingly considered as a blending fuel component and alternative fuel for ICEs [3–5]. For alcohol fuel used in ICEs, it should go through a series of intertwined processes including atomization, gaseous mixing, evaporation and chemical reaction from fuel injection into the engine cylinder to combustion. In the processes, the collision between the fuel spray and the cylinder wall is almost inevitable. The dynamic behavior of the formed droplet group is closely related to the heat transfer in subsequent evaporation and ignition. The fuel droplets formed therein by injection exhibit a long ignition delay time (IDT) mainly due to the Leidenfrost effect during combustion and its high evaporation latent heat [1]. Leidenfrost effect is a common phenomenon that liquid droplets are suspended on their own vapor film when exposed to a hot surface. Of which, both factors severely weaken the combustion heat transfer [6–9]. In this case, evaporation disturbance will occur, and it happens to be one of the main driving factors for the formation of combustion instability in diffusion combustion [10,11]. As a consequence, reliable start-up and high-efficiency combustion of alcohol fuels under the engine-relevant low-to-intermediate temperature conditions are currently the major targets in the combustion-directional research. Nevertheless, the thermal efficiency of the overall combustion system induced by the relatively low calorific value of alcohols leads to temperature fluctuation during the physical mixing and chemical reaction in the early stages of combustion, which in turn causes the unreliable start-up and unstable combustion. Besides, the presence of amounts of unburned HC compounds in the cold start-up indicates incomplete combustion, bringing about the problems of fuel consumption and pollutant emission control [12,13]. In view of these, enhancing the heat transfer efficiency and combustion stability of ICEs have become a research hotspot to be solved. To a certain extent, traditional method of engine structural design can adjust the spontaneous ignition and heat transfer rate. Subsequently, it is conducive to improving energy efficiency and reducing pollutant emissions. However, the method is difficult, and it will also affect the performance and service life of the engine. By contrast, using hybrid fuel with reactivity modification is a preferable solution from the perspective of energy conversion and utilization, which is also in line with the development trend of low-temperature, high-efficiency and environment-friendly combustion technology. Energetic nanoparticles (NPs), as attractive additives, have been used in various liquid fluids because of their high volumetric energy density [14,15] and excellent thermal conductivity [16]. NPs with high energy release demonstrate the potential for improving the heat transfer [17], boosting the evaporation/burning rate [18,19], shortening the IDT [20] and adjusting the fuel reactivity [21] in combustion systems. In this regard, Jones et al. [19] found that the combustion heat release rate of ethanol with 10 vol.% aluminum nanoparticles increased by ∼15%, which in turn affected the IDT. Allen et al. [21] examined that the effect of 2 wt% Al NPs on the IDT of ethanol-based fuel was highlighted by its remarkable decrease compared with neat ethanol at the same conditions. Simultaneously, the benefit of increasing thermal conductivity to promote rapid evaporation and pre-ignition was emphasized. The effects of nano-additives including CNTs and silver (Ag) on the combustion characteristics of diesel and biodiesel were investigated by Najafi [22]. The results showed that the IDT was shortened and the rate of combustion heat release was increased by adding nano-additives. Pandey et al. [23] verified the interplay between combustion heat release rate and droplet vaporization rate in the research of the effect of nano-additive ceria on the combustion characteristics of ethanol-water droplets. The results showed that ethanol-based droplet exhibited continuous disruptive behavior with mild intensity, revealing the flame fluctuations resulted from the local ejection of droplets related to combustion instability, and such event was influenced by the heat release. However, it should be noted that the reduction of IDT of nanoparticle-laden fuels is limited and hardly reflects its effective control of the Leidenfrost effect during combustion. Javed et al. [24,25] conducted a series of studies on the effect of aluminum nanoparticles (Al NPs) on the evaporation, auto-ignition and combustion characteristics of kerosene droplets at intermediate-to-high temperatures. The results identified that the IDT of droplets decreased exponentially with the increase of temperature due to the reduction of the physical delay including heating-up and pre-ignition vaporization stages. While the influence of Leidenfrost effect at lower temperatures near the boiling point of fuel droplets can be speculated from variations in evaporation rates at different temperature regions, yet no relevant results involved. Taken all together, it only alters the Leidenfrost temperature but does not achieve inhibition if merely adjusting the evaporation or combustion characteristics by the addition of nano-additives. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new strategies to inhibit the Leidenfrost effect for the realization of stable combustion. Of interest, using reactive enhancers with improving ignition as well as combustion characteristics is a fine solution. In previous practice, silane was selected as a common additive to promote ignition under extreme conditions in a scramjet engine due to its pyrophoricity and high reactivity with oxygen [26,27]. Northam et al. [28] investigated the effect of silane concentration on the supersonic combustion of silane/methane blending fuels. The results showed that IDT can be shortened by an order of magnitude or more while the auto-ignition temperature of methane can be reduced to 370 °C by adding 10% and 20% silane. Besides, hydrogen enrichment is a method for solving the shortcomings such as lower energy density and high evaporation latent heat associated with alcohols for ICEs, thereby increasing combustion efficiency, expanding the flammable range of alcohols, and reducing pollutant emissions [12]. But hydrogen itself will produce the problems of cost-efficiency, low volume energy density and unsafe implementation. For liquid fuels, organometallic compounds have been proven to effectively extend the lower limit of the ignition temperature as well as reduce the IDT because of their high reactivity in contact with oxidants such as oxygen [29]. For instance, aluminum borohydride was originally considered as an ignition source for turbojet combustors [30]. Thereafter Ryan et al. [31,32] confirmed that the aluminum alkyl derivatives efficiently shortened the ignition temperature and the IDT of JP-10 in the constant volume combustion tester while enhancing the reactivity of JP-10. However, the following defects of above studies exist: (i) the fuel reactivity is not well regulated the excessive reactivity of additives and (ii) the excessive reactivity of enhancers makes themselves or the blending fuels prone to spontaneous ignition, leading to difficulties in implementation and storage. In prior studies, our team investigated a composite-fuel enhancer of methoxydiethylborane/tetrahydrofuran (MDEB/THF) for the low-temperature ignition promotion of kerosene [33]. Attributed to the relatively low activity of additive compared to others, the safety and usability of the hybrid fuel systems are outstanding. Importantly, the ignition temperature and IDT of kerosene-based fuels are significantly reduced. Noteworthy results indicated that the change of IDT with increasing temperature was non-monotonic, and essentially no solution was given. The essence of this negative growth behavior lies in the Leidenfrost effect resulted from the gaseous protective film formed during the evaporation and combustion, significantly reducing the efficiency of heat transfer. Whereas conventional heat transfer enhancement individually by increasing thermal conductivity hardly overcome the obstacle. Relevant combustion chemistry studies have shown that the enhancement of fuel chemical reactivity and the formation of active free radicals are beneficial to the promotion of heat release in the combustion system [34], which serve as bases for developing new strategies to achieve stable combustion of alcohol fuels at low temperatures with inhibiting the Leidenfrost effect. Unfortunately, fundamental research on reactive organometallic compounds additives applied to promote the ignition and combustion of the alcohols effectively has been rarely reported. Consequently, it deserves a comprehensive study to provide supplement to the optimal design of ICEs fuel. Inspired by the above, this study attempts to break through the barriers that traditional adjustments of combustion characteristics cannot essentially solve the combustion problems. Our main objectives are: (i) to explore the feasibility of inhibiting the Leidenfrost effect in the combustion of alcohols through fuel reactivity modification; (ii) to establish the regulation principle and method for the stable combustion of ethanol-based fuel in a wide temperature range. Atmospheric pressure, compared with the high pressure of traditional ICEs, a more severe operation condition is used herein, which is more convincing for verifying the availability of reliable startup and revealing the underlying mechanism of stable combustion enhancement. Specifically, methoxydiethylborane (MDEB) with excellent reactivity is preferred as a fuel modifier to regulate the physicochemical properties at low temperatures. Two distinct cases have been performed with the first focusing on the effects of various modifier ratios on the ignition and combustion of single base ethanol fuel, and the second being a comprehensive investigation of the combustion of binary base ethanol/n-decane fuel. Modification of the combustion heat transfer is realized by adjusting self-propagating oxidation exothermic accompanied by in-situ active radical generation, thereby suppressing the adverse influence of the Leidenfrost effect. Under the synergistic effect, the lower limit of ignition temperature of alcohol-based fuel is expanded and the overall IDT is significantly reduced at low temperatures. Finally, stable and efficient combustion of alcohol-based fuels can be achieved, which are expected to replace gasoline or diesel for ICEs."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Fuel specifications and preparations,"2.1 Fuel specifications and preparations The ethanol (CAS: 64-17-5, ≥99.8%) and n-decane (CAS: 124-18-5, > 99.9%) (CAS: 124-18-5, 》99.8%) used as the key basic alcohol and hydrocarbon fuel are supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Limited Corporation and Macklin Biochemical Technology Corporation, respectively. MDEB (CAS: 7397-46-8) that is dissolved in a biological solvent THF (CAS: 109-99-9) used as the fuel modifier is supplied by Sun Chemical Technology (Shanghai) Limited Corporation. The hybrid fuel investigated herein is a mixture of ethanol (or ethanol/n-decane) and MDEB. Because of its relatively high octane number flash point, ethanol has been widely regarded as a single biofuel candidate or a mixing component with conventional fuel for ICEs [1,35]. For reactive fuels, the key to modification technology lies in the choice of chemical ingredients. Thus, MDEB, as a reactive organometallic compound, is used to enhance the ignition at low-to-intermediate temperatures, considering the special radicals in the molecule. THF, a harmonious ignition auxiliary, is added to the fuel system because it is not only a potential biomass alternative fuel for ICEs, but also can stably dissolve various polar and non-polar chemicals [36,37]. Notably, the concentration of MDEB dissolved in the THF herein is 4 M and its effective specific gravity is calculated to be nearly 46%, which enables it to be stored stably and used conveniently. Table 1 shows the physical properties of these components in the hybrid fuels. Homogeneous hybrid fuels with various proportions of MDEB (4 M in THF solvent) (listed in Table 2 ) prepared by manual mixing under normal temperature environment were studied to obtain the appropriate ratio for promoting the stable combustion of ethanol-based fuel at low-to-high temperatures."
3,Experimental facility,"2.2 Experimental facility Fig. 1 illustrates a schematic of the droplet-hot plate collision experiment facility for the evaporation and ignition test [38]. The construction and operational principle of the device are described as follows: (i) three stainless steel heating tubes (each 500 W) are inserted evenly into a titanium alloy heater with excellent thermal conductivity, benefiting to obtain a uniform temperature; (ii) to maintain the droplet in the test and capture area, a hemispherical circular hole (r = 5 mm) is designed in the center of the heater surface; (iii) temperature sweeps are performed by setting the temperature of the PID temperature controller to the required surface temperature (with an accuracy of 1 °C), within which the surface temperature is measured by a K-type thermocouple located in the heater and the adjustable temperature is from room temperature to 700 °C. Fuel droplets with a uniform diameter of approximately 2.0 mm are produced by a medical syringe pump (needle length 80 mm, gauge number 9) at a vertical distance of 20 mm from the heater surface. Logically, the drop test would provide a practical condition for the repeatability of measurements. High-speed COMS camera (Phantom v6.2e) photography is employed to determine the experimental data acquisition of fuel evaporation, ignition and combustion on the hot-plate. A uniform front-to-back illumination intensity is provided by LED backlight and dynamic images with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels are captured at 1000 frames per second. Afterwards, the information related to the ignition of alcohol-based fuels can be extracted from the photographs. Under a wide range of temperature test conditions, the flammable temperature limits of pure alcohol-based fuel and alcohol-based reactive fuels with varied MDEB proportion can be determined, meanwhile, the ignition delay time is also determined by using a high-speed camera. Due to the uncertainty of the experimental facility, ten repetitive drop tests are performed for each case under the same condition, which can minimize the errors caused by the size fluctuation and randomness of the fuel droplet formation."
4,Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiment,"2.3 Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiment EPR technology is often used to detect free radicals and provides their structure information to determine the types of free radicals and study the free radical reaction kinetics of organometallic compounds. Herein, the in-situ free radicals produced by self-oxidation of MDEB and hybrid fuels with MDEB are determined by EPR (EMXplus-9.5/12, Bruker, Germany). 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine N-oxide (DMPO) (0.1 M), a widely used nitrone spin trapping reagent, was added in the test fuel samples due to its fast capture speed and sensitivity to alkyl and alkoxy radicals, which can not only trap carbon-centric free radicals generated in chemical systems, but also oxygen-centric free radicals [39]. The detailed measurement parameters of EPR are as follows: Sweep width: 199.714 G; Center field: 3510.21 G; Sampling time: 0.04289 s; Field modulation amplitude: 0.0002 T; Field modulation frequency: 100000 Hz; Microwave frequency: 9.888 GHz; Microwave power: 0.01002 W; Receiver Gain: 30; Receiver Time Constant: 0.02048 s."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Alcohol-based fuel evaporation and ignition behavior,"3.1 Alcohol-based fuel evaporation and ignition behavior 3.1.1 Evaporation characteristics of alcohol fuel droplet with Leidenfrost effect The droplet-hot plate collision device's ability to capture the evaporation characteristics for fuel droplets under variable temperature conditions. The measured evaporation time of the fuel droplets allow evaluation of the influence of Leidenfrost effect on the evaporation heat transfer performance, and consequently for revealing the essence of the low-temperature combustion problems. The measured peak of the evaporation time (t evap ) with the surface temperature (T s ) basically determines the Leidenfrost point (LFP), which also reflects the heat transfer rate. Temperature sweep of the evaporation time of pure ethanol is extracted as a comparative reference for enhancing reactivity requirements, as seen in Fig. 2 . Each point data obtained is taken from the average of at least five measurements, error bars are also used to represent standard deviations so as to ensure the reliability. Below 150 °C which is slightly higher than the boiling point of ethanol (78 °C), the droplet boils immediately after contacting the hot plate and t evap reaches the minimum of approximately 750 ms. At larger T s , t evap significantly rises up to the maximum (≈30 s) which defines the LFP (T L ≈ 200 °C). Above T L , t evap gradually decreases with T s , a classical presentation in the Leidenfrost regime: Vapor cushion insulates the droplet from the hot wall, thereby preventing boiling and impeding evaporation heat transfer. As a result, t evap is still an order of magnitude higher than the minimum at T s = 500 °C. This decrease is speculated that the endothermicity of ethanol dominated by the evaporation latent heat of ethanol shows a certain reduction with the ambient temperature increasing. Moreover, the similar Leidenfrost effect behavior of 10% ethanol/90% n-decane (E10/n-D90) is also emphasized in the supplementary materials (Fig. S1) for further verification. By contrast, with the addition of THF and MDEB, the evaporation rate of such hybrid fuels should be physically improved to a certain extent excluding the chemical effect of MDEB, based on the evaporation theory of multi-component liquids and the mechanism of multi-component effect [33,40–43]. Anyway, the Leidenfrost effect in the low temperatures region inevitably inhibits the rapid evaporation and prolongs the physical regime, which is detrimental to the efficient ignition and subsequent combustion. 3.1.2 Effect of MDEB blending ratio on ignition performance of ethanol-based hybrid fuel droplets To investigate the effect of MDEB addition on the ignition performance of ethanol, temperature sweeps of varied ethanol/MDEB mass blends are performed from 100 to 650 °C under atmospheric pressure. The ignition probability is a typical combustion parameter that reflect the reliability of ignition, and the transition from the lower limit of ignition temperature to complete ignition can be obtained. Since the ignition probability belongs to the category of statistical data, the measured value herein is obtained by calculating the ignition percentage of no less than ten ignition experiments at a specific surface temperature. Moreover, the ignition temperature is defined as the surface temperature with a 50% ignition probability, from which the flammable temperature limits of the test fuels can be determined. For ethanol and low MDEB concentration blends, ignition is achieved at a low temperature of approximately 250 °C compared to pure ethanol, whereas the ignition is not completely reliable as shown in Fig. 3 (A1-A4). It is noted that there is an obvious temperature transition (250–400 °C) for the overall ignition event and blending MDEB into ethanol improves the flammability of the hybrid fuels significantly. Different MDEB blend conditions are performed with various solid line colors, and the lower and upper transition temperatures and transition region are marked with dotted lines and dotted rectangle. The phenomenon is explicable because the chemical reactivity of fuel components is stimulated by the characteristic molecular structure of MDEB and its high reactivity, which promotes the occurrence of ignition. On the other hand, the high latent heat of vaporization of ethanol makes evaporation difficult and the Leidenfrost effect is exceptionally obvious, which in turn inhibit the ignition. Additionally, it can be observed that the negative growth of ignition probability in the transition temperature regime gradually narrows down along with the increasing MDEB content, and corresponds to the minimum value at 350 °C, as seen in Fig. 3 (A1-A4). When the MDEB content rises to a certain level, the phenomenon of negative growth behavior disappears, as represented in the data of 44% MDEB/ethanol in Fig. 3 (A5) and 48% MDEB/ethanol in Fig. 3 (A6), where the MDEB addition ratio includes THF. Simultaneously, the ignition temperature of the hybrid fuel with 48% MDEB further reduced to 225 °C, which is approximately 370 °C lower than pure ethanol (curve A0). The results imply that the self-propagating oxidation heat release caused by the increased reactivity enhanced the heat transfer of the combustion, which potentially improves the reliable ignition of ethanol in a wide range of temperatures. The ignition delay time (IDT) is an important evaluation parameter for the combustion performance of liquid fuels, especially reflecting the physical heat transfer efficiency (spray breakups, vaporization, gas-phase mixing) and chemical ignition delay (elementary reaction rate). The IDT here is expressed as the time interval between the droplet instantly collides with the hot plate and the instantaneous flame occurrence, which is obtained by using a high-speed camera to extract the corresponding time. Fig. 4 depicts the comparison of IDT for ethanol with different representative MDEB proportion and pure ethanol. As seen in Fig. 4 (b), pure ethanol tends to exhibit a long IDT at the initial high temperature of 100% ignition probability (2041 ms at T s = 600 °C). The addition of MDEB accelerates the ignition significantly: the IDT at a low temperature of 300 °C is reduced by an order of magnitude. This is straightforward because the more reactive MDEB rapidly self-oxidizes first under certain condition, accompanied by propagating into the fuel component and continuously releases heat, which produces a higher chemical reaction rate and accelerates the ignition of the less reactive ethanol. It should be noted that no valid data was obtained since ignition was not achieved at 350 °C when the MDEB concentration is 32% or lower, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). In addition, a typical negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior is observed in the total IDT, which has rarely pointed out in previous alcohol-based fuel combustion researches where (less or few efforts focused on the lower) mainly focused on the higher temperature conditions limited by reactivity. Moreover, the NTC regime of the IDT shifts to higher temperature (350–450 °C) relative to the transition temperature region of the ignition probability in Fig. 3 (A1-A4). Although the self-oxidation heat release of MDEB increases with increasing temperature, but the combustion chemical reactivity of ethanol and the tetrahydrofuran component of the modifier actually decrease with increasing temperature in the NTC. Thus, even if the heat release breaks through the inhibition of the Leidenfrost effect on the evaporation heat transfer to achieve ignition, but the overall heat accumulation rate and the chemical reaction rate for the combustible gas gradually decrease, which inevitably causes the IDT at higher temperatures to increase instead. As such the interplay between fuel combustion chemistry and the Leidenfrost effect on the ignition and combustion of ethanol needs to be further investigated in the future. Before and after the NTC regime, the IDT shows a regular Arrhenius trend with increasing surface temperature. Finally, the IDT of ethanol containing 32% and 48% MDEB are 38 and 28 ms at T s = 600 °C, respectively, which are two orders of magnitude lower than that of ethanol. The discovery of the above two different NTC regimes is important for understanding the low-temperature oxidation chemistry, Leidenfrost effect and overall ignition of alcohols, which would provide support for the development of advanced combustion control strategies for ICEs."
7,"Effect of MDEB blending on the evaporation, ignition and combustion performance of ethanol/n-decane binary fuel droplets","3.2 Effect of MDEB blending on the evaporation, ignition and combustion performance of ethanol/n-decane binary fuel droplets With the basic understanding of the single ethanol-based fuel ignition performance, it is then interesting to investigate the evaporation, ignition and combustion performance of binary ethanol/n-decane-based fuel which is not only a more reasonable practical choice for the development of advanced combustion control strategies for ICEs, but also aircraft engine. 3.2.1 Visualization of ethanol/n-decane-based fuel droplets dynamics behavior Fuel combustion is essentially a heat transfer process accompanied by physical mixing and chemical reactions, in which heat transfer is closely related to droplet dynamics in certain conditions. Understanding the effect of heat transfer on the droplet evaporation, ignition and combustion dynamics behavior is therefore of considerable scientific and practical significance. Fig. 5 Shows the dynamics comparison of E10/n-D90 fuel droplet containing 50% MDEB (calculated effective weight of 23%) at different surface temperatures around LFP (250 < T s < 350 °C), corresponding to different evaporation characteristics along with the ignition occurrence. As seen from Fig. 5 (a), the droplet can ignite at T s = 130 °C, which is lower than the boiling point of the primary component n-decane, but higher than the boiling points of the components ethanol, MDEB and THF. Three successive stages before the flame appearance obviously included: impact, extension, and vaporization. When the fallen droplet contacts the hot plate, it quickly extends (t = t 0 + 4 ms), vaporizes, and meanwhile the droplet internal temperature keeps rising. Components other than n-decane tend to undergo transition boiling and sputter daughter droplets outward, then convert to the slow evaporation of the component n-decane with liquid film formation (t = t 0 + 560 ms). Driven by the increased fuel reactivity and ambient temperature rise, the self-oxidation of MDEB releases heat and propagates to build a combustible atmosphere with the surrounding hot air. Additionally, the rapid vaporization of ethanol and THF also provide support for the heat transfer enhancement and the suitable equivalence ratio achievement, a flame then appears (t = t 0 + 1514 ms). As seen in Fig. 5 (b), when the T s rises to 200 °C above the boiling point of n-decane (174 °C), the droplet oscillates vigorously against the hole wall and vaporizes quickly (from 5 to 436 ms), which is clearly visible in the supplementary material (Video S2), and ignition occurs in the gas-phase combustible area diagonally above the hole (t = t 0 + 573 ms). As the T s rises to 400 °C above the LFP (Fig. 5 (c)), The classical Leidenfrost droplet evaporation occurs after spreading mainly including two stages: retraction and spherical evaporation (from 4 to 77 ms). Afterwards, a flame appears 10 ms later (t = t 0 + 87 ms) in the gas-phase combustible area slightly higher than the droplet core. It is clear that the self-propagating oxidation heat release of MDEB effectively breaks through the Leidenfrost effect and the endothermic induced by the evaporation latent heat of ethanol/n-decane in the vaporization phase. Thus, the droplet tends to oscillate slightly against the hole wall so that more heat and combustible gas are continuously transferred to the vaporized fuel, which facilitates effective heat transfer and heat accumulation of the ethanol/n-decane fuel system, thereby achieving rapid ignition and sustaining combustion. Comparison of fore-mentioned droplets dynamics videos are shown in supplementary material (Videos S1–S3). Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121248. The following are the supplementary data related to this article: Video S1 2 Video S1 Video S2 3 Video S2 Video S3 4 Video S3 In an actual combustion environment, short IDT and high-efficiency combustion heat transfer are essential for reliable ignition and stable combustion of alternative fuels. As illustrated in Fig. 6 (a), the representative combustion dynamics of 50% MDEB/E10/n-D90 hybrid fuel droplet at T s = 600 °C well confirms this statement. Specifically, the droplet collides with the hot plate to vaporize quickly and sputters out in a short time to produce numerous daughter droplets (t = t 0 + 24 ms). Under the conditions of rapid increase in combustible gas concentration and high ambient temperature, a flame therefore appears at region close the center of the hemispherical hole (t = t 0 + 27 ms). The flame continuously expands driven by the combustion heat transfer, subsequently forms a vigorous flame (t = t 0 + 1217 ms) and illuminates the entire plate surface. An obvious phenomenon worth noting is that the mother droplet in the flame intermittently burst out of the secondary flame and merge into the primary flame during the expansion to supplement energy and accelerate combustion (from 612 to 1008 ms). This demonstrates that the highly reactive MDEB of the droplet kernel continuously in-situ generate numerous active radicals when exposed to hot air. Thereafter, the flame gradually retracts accompanying by the droplet burning steadily in a similar region and fades away, indicating the excellent stability of the entire combustion event. By comparison, neat ethanol/decane ignites within a longer evaporation period dominated by the characteristic Leidenfrost effect and its low reactivity. The relatively low heat transfer efficiency and temperature rise in the evaporation directly causes the longer IDT (t = t 0 + 1546 ms) as shown in Fig. 6 (b). In the case where the ignition surface temperature is significantly higher than the Leidenfrost temperature, the vapors of ethanol/n-decane continuously and slowly generates in the spheroidal evaporation stage and diffuses into the hot atmosphere. After a period of heat accumulation, fire occurs far away from the contact location. At a slightly lower temperature, ignition of neat ethanol/decane no longer occurs, which indicates that the reliable ignition is almost independent of other factors but mainly related to the heat transfer and ambient temperature. Furthermore, MDEB/E10/n-D90 combusts at low temperatures with blue flame rather than the combustion of neat E10/n-D90 with yellow or red flame caused by soot formation, indicating the low-temperature stable and complete combustion of E10/n-D90 (Videos S4 and S5). This reflects the reduction in the production of unburned HC compounds during the low-temperature start-up of alcohol-based fuel for ICEs, highlighting the additional improvement in pollutant emission control. The comparison clearly shows that the combustion heat transfer rate increase with the introduction of reactive MDEB, thereby increasing the efficiency of heat accumulation. As a result, reliable ignition and stable combustion are observed in experiments with an extraordinary low IDT. Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121248. The following are the supplementary data related to this article: Video S5 5 Video S5 Video S4 6 Video S4 3.2.2 The effect of MDEB blending ratio on ignition performance Fig. 7 depicts the effect of surface temperature on the ignition probability of E10/n-D90 binary fuel with varied MDEB blending ratio. The ignition temperature corresponding to 100% ignition probability of MDEB/E10/n-D90 hybrid fuels are significantly lower than that of neat E10/n-D90 fuel from the ignition probability curves. The low reactivity of ethanol and n-decane determines the high ignition temperature of E10/n-D90, of which the minimum ignition temperature tested is 590 °C, corresponding to a 40% ignition probability. As shown in the figure, the reactivity of hybrid fuels increases with the increase of MDEB blending ratio. A MDEB mass fraction of 30% (calculated effective weight of 13.8%) effectively reduces the minimum surface temperature to 220 °C (gray curve). When the MDEB proportion reaches 50% (an effective weight of 23%), the minimum ignition temperature of the hybrid fuel can be reduced to 125 °C, which is 465 °C lower than that of neat E10/n-D90, as shown by the wine and dark gray curves in Fig. 7. Note that compared with the case of a higher MEDB blend ratio, the temperature zone between the minimum ignition temperature and the 100% ignition temperature at the lower ratio is significantly wider. For the 30% MDEB/E10/n-D90 hybrid fuel, although the reactivity increases with the increasing temperature, the widespread Leidenfrost effect and high evaporation latent heat of ethanol will inhibit the overall ignition, which leads to a long transition temperature zone. The IDT is critical to the advancement of fuel combustion process, reflecting the heat transfer efficiency and ignition reliability. As seen in Fig. 8 (a), the binary fuel of n-decane and low concentration ethanol exhibits a long IDT due to the low reactivity of the components (1584 ms at T s = 600 °C). The NTC regime exhibits a significant effect on the overall ignition and low-to-intermediate temperature oxidation kinetics of alkane fuels, as well as alkane-alcohol binary fuels. Fig. 8 (b) shows the effects as the MDEB mass concentration is increased from 30% to 50% with a noticeable NTC region from 300 to 450 °C observed for hybrid fuel with 40% MDEB or less throughout the ignition event, but no NTC behavior observed when MDEB concentration is 50%. The same IDT variation tendency as Fig. 8 (b) can be found more intuitively by Fig. S2 in the supplementary material. Remarkably, the IDT of MDEB/E10/n-D90 hybrid droplets drops a lot in a wide range of temperature compared with that of neat E10/n-D90 binary fuel. For the mass concentration of MDEB is 40%, at the lower temperatures (T s < 300 °C), ahead of the NTC region, the IDT gradually decreases and drops to 301 ms at 300 °C, which is significantly shorter than the lifetime of the hybrid fuel droplet. In the NTC region the extent of negative growth behavior in IDT corresponding to 40% MDEB is weakened, and compared to the lower concentration of MDEB at 30%, the IDT at 450 °C quickly drops below the corresponding value of 350 °C. When the MDEB proportion reaches 50% (an effective weight of 23%), the IDT shows a regular trends of increasing reactivity with the increase of surface temperature without local negative growth behavior, instead, with obvious Arrhenius behavior at such an appropriate improver concentration. This implies that there is a ‘transition’ region for the relationship between the NTC and the MDEB proportion when the proportion is beyond a certain value (in this case, nearly 50%). Particularly, the IDT of hybrid fuels with 50% MDEB is dramatically decreased to 27 ms at T s = 600 °C. Combined with the evaporation time scatterplot of E10/n-D90 in Fig. S1, the reasons for the change in NTC behavior should be twofold: firstly, E10/n-D90 blend gradually exhibits obvious Leidenfrost effect when T s > 250 °C and hence have low heat transfer efficiency for the droplet to evaporation and subsequent ignition; secondly, the yield of active radicals in oxidation of E10/n-D90 blends with lower MDEB proportion is relatively low due to the low temperature chemistry (LTC) reactivity of E10/n-D90 blend within NTC regime. It should be noted that these two effects are largely coupled and the high latent heat of evaporation of binary fuel components, especially ethanol, also inhibit the overall ignition. Therefore, combining the results of the negative growth degree in IDT decreases by approximately 100 ms from 30% to 40% and the monotonic change of IDT when MDEB concentration is 50%, it is highly suggested that the main reason for the disappearance of NTC is due to the sufficient reactive intermediates and heat released from the characteristic reaction pathways, which inhibits the Leidenfrost effect and enhances the LTC reactivity of E10/n-D90 blend as a whole. In this case, the low-to-high temperature ignition of ethanol/n-decane binary fuel is significantly improved. Moreover, the specific intermediates and reaction pathways will be described in detail in Section 3.3.1."

To be specific, the self-oxidation reaction of reactive MDEB preferred herein occurs at an instant of ∼100 °C, releasing a theoretical heat of 4488.3 kJ/mol that can be calculated by Eq. (1) according to Hess's law. (1) ΔH = ∑ E (Reactant)-∑ E (Product) As a fuel droplet containing MDEB collides with the hot surface from a finite height, the oxidation reaction and heat triggered by MDEB continuously propagate into the liquid droplet or fuel vapors which results in the increase of temperature and pressure to rise, and undoubtedly contributes to accelerating the generation of combustible gas and accumulation of heat. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the vapor temperature before ignition will decrease because of the evaporative cooling of the fuel droplet. Meanwhile, the higher the evaporation latent heat (L e ), the more significant the endothermicity becomes, which adversely affect the effective evaporation in the Leidenfrost regime. However, the L e of pure ethanol and n-decane are 43.8477 and 40.4461 kJ/mol obtained from the following Eq. (2) [44,45], respectively, which are two orders of magnitude lower than the heat released by MDEB. (2) L e = 1.093 · R · T c · T b c l n ( 10 · P c ) − 1 0.93 − T b c where R, T c , P c are the universal gas constant, critical temperature and critical pressure, respectively, and T bc refers to the reduced temperature that represents the ratio of boiling point to critical temperature. Based on the thermodynamic calculation, it is then reasonably considered that the self-oxidation exotherm of MDEB with a suitable concentration is sufficient to break through the inhibition of heat transfer caused by the adiabatic vapor cushion or fuel endothermicity. Ultimately, a strategy based on the reliable ignition of liquid fuels for ICEs at low temperatures is established by using the self-propagating oxidation reaction with significant heat release. 3.3.2 Identification of active radicals and role in accelerating the reaction To uncover the potential mechanism of low-temperature ignition with the function of inhibiting the Leidenfrost effect, it is important to identify the reaction pathways contributing to the active radicals generation. Regarding the detection of radicals, EPR seems to be the most appropriate technique. The technique is based on the detection of unpaired electronic transitions in a magnetic field by using a suitable spin trapping agent to combine with active radicals to form a relatively stable spin adduct [46]. The EPR results of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•) and DPPH•/MDEB are provided in the Supplementary material (Fig. S3), which is a preliminary verification that MDEB can self-oxidize at room temperature and generate active radicals. Subsequently, to determine the reaction pathways contributing to the low-temperature ignition of alcohol-based fuels, further EPR experiments are conducted by using DMPO. Fig. 9 shows the EPR spectra of DMPO and two sets of hybrid fuels measured exposed to the air for 1 min in an atmospheric environment, and the results of DMPO/ethanol and DMPO/E10/n-D90 are used for comparison. The EPR spectra of DMPO/ethanol and DMPO/E10/n-D90 show that there is no reaction between the DMPO and two sets of base fuels, which indicates that base fuels oxide slowly at room temperature and no active radicals generate, as shown by the black lines in Fig. 9 (a) and (b). The strong six-fold signal in DMPO/MDEB is obvious as shown by the same olive line in Fig. 9 (a) and (b), indicating DMPO capturing characteristic radicals well, which further proves that the self-oxidation of MDEB is indeed accompanied by the generation of alkoxy radicals, as proposed by Towell et al. [47]. Meanwhile, the discrepancy in peak intensities and magnetic field corresponding to the peak value of EPR spectra are observed between DMPO/MDEB and DMPO/MDEB/ethanol as shown by the olive and purple line in Fig. 9 (a). Similarly, the discrepancy also exists in DMPO/MDEB and DMPO/MDEB/E10/n-D90. The results indicate that radicals produced by self-oxidation of MDEB and the oxidation of two sets of hybrid fuel containing MDEB are not the same. It is supposed that the oxidation reaction of MDEB/ethanol and MDEB/E10/n-D90 produce other active radicals due to the change in fuel reactivity driven by the addition of MDEB to base fuels, especially alkyl radicals, as proposed by Guo et al. [39]. According to Sonnenschein's research on the reaction pathways of MDEB self-oxidation, it can be inferred that the measured active radicals released by MDEB correspond to alkoxy radicals (RO), including ethyoxy (C2H5O) and methoxy (CH3O) [48]. The specific reaction pathways are described as the following R1-R3. It is worth emphasizing that the energy of free radical products formed by the reaction of oxygen with MDEB is favorable, although R2 is considered a reversible reaction [48–50]. Moreover, RO generated in R2 and R3 are more involved in the subsequent oxidation reaction of the hybrid fuels, which drives the forward progress of these two steps. (R1) (C2H5)2BOCH3 + O2 → C2H5(C2H5OO)B(OCH3) (R2) C2H5(C2H5OO)B(OCH3) → C2H5(CH3O)BO + C2H5O (R3) 3C2H5(CH3O)BO → (C2H5)3B3O3 + 3CH3O Regarding the combustion chemistry of ethanol, its consumption is commonly triggered by hydrogen abstraction by radicals (including H, OH, HO2, and CH3), wherein the reaction pathway of HO2 attacking hydrogen at different sites in ethanol (R4-R6) is considered as the primary reaction, significantly affecting the overall IDT and global reactivity [51–53]. However, the formed H2O2 is stable at low temperatures (<1000 K) so that the rate of its subsequent decomposition into OH radical is relatively low [53]. Therefore, the deficiency of OH radical in ethanol combustion reveals the reason for its low-temperature reactivity. With the addition of MDEB, it is proposed that active radicals (RO) released by MDEB react with ethanol, converting the first step of ethanol consumption at low temperatures to the following pathway (R8) to a great extent. Similarly, changes also occur in the ethanol/n-decane binary fuel oxidation reaction, where the first step of n-decane component oxidation is changed from R9 to R10 [33,54]. Here, it is assumed that ethanol and n-decane have no significant fuel-to-fuel interaction based on relevant researches. (R4) C2H5OH + HO2 → CH2CH2OH + H2O2 (R5) C2H5OH + HO2 → CH3CHOH + H2O2 (R6) C2H5OH + HO2 → C2H5O + H2O2 (R7) H2O2 → 2OH (R8) C2H5OH + RO → OHCH2CH2OH + R (R9) C10H22 + O2 → C10H21 + HO2 (R10) C10H22 + RO → C10H21OH + R For the two groups of hybrid fuels studied here, the self-oxidation of MDEB releases a lot of heat and constantly propagates into the reaction. Meanwhile, the in-situ generated radicals accelerate the reaction as well as the formation of more active radical intermediates. Among them, the chain reaction initiated by the peroxy radicals (ROO), which formed by the reaction of R radicals and O2, is the key to conventional alkanes oxidation at low temperatures. Besides, ROO is easily isomerized into hydroperoxyalkyl radical (QOOH) [55,56]. Both ROO and QOOH then decompose directly or indirectly to produce OH radicals, as depicted in pathways R11 to R14. (R11) ROO → QO + OH (R12) QOOH → QO + OH (R13) QOOH + O2 → OOQOOH (R14) OOQOOH → QOO· + 2OH The aforementioned active species (R, RO, ROO, QOOH, OOQOOH and OH) and related pathways are identified to contribute to OH radical production and heat release, subsequent accelerating the oxidation reaction and combustion of hybrid fuels. The higher OH radical level further increases the system temperature by releasing heat, also provides an explanation for the low IDT. It should be noted that NTC behavior of ethanol ignition mainly caused by the Leidenfrost effect and high endothermicity at low temperatures is found, which is rarely observed in the previous studies over a wide temperature range. MDEB beneficially brings active radicals ROO and QOOH into the oxidation reaction of ethanol, which promotes the improvement of low-temperature reactivity and heat release. However, the reduced production of ROO and QOOH and its heat release in the Leidenfrost regime scarcely overcome the adiabatic barrier, making the overall ignition event of 50% MDEB/ethanol still exhibits NTC behavior. On the other hand, the yield of ROO and QOOH in oxidation of MDEB/E10/n-D90 is relatively high due to the primary formation generated by the oxidation of n-decane. This eventually enables E10/n-D90 binary fuel to achieve ignition and stable combustion without NTC behavior in a wide temperature range as MDEB concentration increases to the same value, compared to pure ethanol. The ignition characteristics of the hybrid fuels including low ignition temperature and low IDT mean the improvement of heat transfer efficiency, which is a reasonable basis for suppressing the heat insulation dominated by Leidenfrost effect despite the objective existence of such phenomenon. Based on the above analyses, a mechanism with inhibition of the Leidenfrost effect for reliable ignition and efficient combustion of alcohol-based hybrid fuels is therefore proposed, which is summarized as the self-propagating oxidation heat release accompanied by in-situ radical generation. For basic research and practical application in ICEs, the introduction of reactive MDEB improves the fuel reactivity and inhibits the Leidenfrost effect, achieving reliable ignition accompanied by the generation of blue flame in a wide temperature range, which implies excellent low-to-intermediate temperature cold start-up performance and combustion efficiency. This will also contribute to solve the problem of high evaporation temperature at the theoretical equivalence ratio caused by high evaporation latent heat of alcohols for ICEs, compared to traditional gasoline. As a result, key combustion characteristics such as the formation of combustibles, IDT, combustion heat release, etc. will be improved, which is conducive to effective energy accumulation and power acquisition."
9,Conclusions,"In this paper, a strategy of self-propagating oxidation heat release along with in-situ active radical generation is proposed to enhance the reliable ignition and efficient combustion of liquid alcohol fuels, e.g., neat ethanol and binary ethanol/n-decane over a wide temperature range, specifically achieving inhibition of the Leidenfrost effect during the combustion. The introduction of MDEB can provide heat supplementation and high temperature atmosphere for the combustion system through self-propagating oxidation heat release as suggested by thermodynamic calculations and EPR results. Driven by the generation of in-situ active radicals, the combustion chemistry of ethanol-based fuel at low temperatures is enhanced, which is more conducive to supporting oxidation and subsequent combustion. Measurements show that MDEB/ethanol hybrid fuels exhibit typical negative temperature behavior (NTC). With the increase of MDEB concentration, the overall reactivity increases so that the degree of NTC behavior is reduced in time and temperature scales. Similar consistency is observed with the measured overall IDT of MDEB/E10/n-D90, while the NTC behavior of E10/n-D90 with 50% MDEB no longer occurs. As a result, the ignition temperature and the overall IDT of the ethanol-based fuel significantly decreased to 125 °C and 27 ms, respectively. Moreover, hybrid fuels with MDEB combust completely at low temperatures with blue flame rather than generating soot during the combustion of neat ethanol or E10/n-D90 fuel, suggesting efficient combustion and effective control of pollutants. Therefore, our study provides a direct proof for enhancing the stable combustion of alcohol-based fuels at conditions associated with advanced ICEs, as well as enriching the scientific knowledge on solving the reliable start-up and low-pollution combustion at low temperatures."
