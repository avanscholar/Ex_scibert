0,Introduction,"The demand of energy increases over time due to the increasing world population, higher living standards and demands for better air quality. Currently, the primary energy requirement for transport and heating comes from oil or natural gas. These two fuels are generally preferred due to the ease of transportation of liquid or gaseous forms. Combustion of hydrocarbon fuels for transportation and heating causes amounts of air pollution. Therefore, the importance of alternative fuels is increasing. Among the various alternatives, hydrogen fuel offers the highest potential benefits both as a new resource and in terms of pollution reduction. Hydrogen is valued and supported worldwide as an alternative to gasoline, heating oil, natural gas and other fuels in both transportation and transportation applications. It is known that hydrogen exists in abundance on earth, but unfortunately most of the hydrogen on earth is in oxide form so it has no fuel value and naturally there are no desired molecular hydrogen sources. Hydrogen can be produced from both renewable and non-renewable sources in many different processes using a variety of starting sources [1,2]. Reformation method is one of the most common methods among these processes. Alcohols and hydrocarbons are the main starting sources which allow hydrogen production. Compared to other fuels, methanol offers several advantages for hydrogen production. Having only one carbon atom, methanol is the simplest form of the all alcohols. Methanol, which provides several advantages in terms of safety, is accepted as a good H2 carrier in H2 production [3]. The lack of strong CC bond facilitates reforming at low temperatures (200–300 °C). This temperature range is very low compared to other common fuels such as methane with a reforming temperature above 500 °C and ethanol with a reforming temperature of around 400 °C. With these advantages, methanol steam reformation is one of the promising hydrogen production methods due to its advantages such as low conversion temperature, low energy consumption and safety. Also, methanol can be obtained from the renewable sources [4–6]. Among the reactors for using the production of hydrogen, microreactors with microchannel structure in the micron level offer method advantages compared to traditional reactors such as high surface-to-volume ratio, concentrated heat and mass transfer and safe operation [7–9]. Microreactors can use methanol as fuel to produce hydrogen. A reliable constant source of hydrogen can be provided for fuel cells applications using the methanol for steam reforming reaction. Therefore, microreactors for hydrogen production have received considerable attention from many researchers [10–15]. As for the catalyst, the effect of catalyst element composition, some additives, preparation method and reaction conditions on catalyst performance has been studied in the literature [16–18]. Some studies are based on the addition of additives [19–21]. The others focus on the effect of the preparation method [3,22,23]. This interest highlights the importance of the catalyst in the reaction. Copper-based catalysts are the most commonly used for methanol steam reforming reaction due to their high efficiency and selectivity. It is known that the catalyst is quite stable and similar selectivity when compared with Cu-based catalysts with those of groups 8−10. However, regarding catalytic activity, other catalysts have the disadvantage as generating less hydrogen than copper-based ones. ZnO additives have conversion and selectivity enhancing effects for the steam reforming reaction on Cu [3]. Until now, common methods such as precipitation, impregnation, burning, sol-gel, polyol method have been used for the production of methanol steam reforming catalysts. When these methods are examined, complex structures are generally used in almost all of them, both as a precipitation and gelation agent. The obtained precipitates need to be calcined. Again, when obtained powders are coated on the plate with various methods, a homogeneous coating could not be obtained. In addition, the coating could not be durable. Apart from these methods, it is possible to realize the synthesis and catalyst loading in a single step with spray pyrolysis method directly on the reactor, which is an innovative approach. The coatings obtained by spray pyrolysis provide both homogeneous distribution and durable coating feature. Particle size is open to control by experimental conditions. Because of these advantages, spray pyrolysis is an interesting. Zheng et al. used copper foam as a microreactor to produce hydrogen by methanol steam reform. In order to distribute the catalyst homogeneously on the copper foam, they designed a new model by changing the feed pressure and flow rate of the catalyst precursor solution and allowing the copper foam to flow into the inner pore structures and interpreted the hydrogen production performance [24]. Kim and Kwon used the endothermic catalytic steam reforming method of methanol to produce hydrogen. They used a catalytic micro reactor for the reaction. They manufactured the micro reactor with the wet etching method. They prepared the Cu/ZnO catalyst by co-precipitation method and realized hydrogen production by methanol steam reform [13]. Kim and Kang synthesized Cu-Ti-P oxide catalysts using solvothermal method and investigated their effects on methanol steam reforming. They used y-Al2O3, Cu-Ti-P / y-Al2O3, Cu-Ti-P / y-Al2O3 as catalyst. They interpreted the performance of each catalyst structure [25]. Tajrishi et al. used a parallel type microchannel reactor for hydrogen production by methanol vapor reforming method. They studied the effects of several Cu-based nanocatalysts [26]. Liu et al. used copper foams with different types of hole arrays as catalyst supports to build cylindrical, micro-reactors. They used a laser processing method to produce copper foams with arrays of holes and a two-layer impregnation method to load Cu/Zn/Al/Zr catalysts. They studied the reaction performance of the micro reactor for hydrogen production with various hole size configurations [8]. There are many more studies on the reactor type and catalyst structure in the literature [15,27,28]. However, in the study, there is a new catalyst that is not found in the literature. Synthesis and reactor coating were carried out in a single step by spray pyrolysis method. In addition, this method makes it possible to produce homogeneous and durable coating. Manufacturing of the micro reactors are given in the 2.2. section of the article, the coating of the plates with two different catalysts and the durability tests are given in the 2.3. section. In the 2.4. section, the coating of the reactor with spray pyrolysis and the assembly stages are included. The last part of the study consists of establishing a methanol steam reforming system and conducting experiments in various process parameters. As a result, H2 content and methanol conversions were interpreted in the “Results and Discussion” section."
1,Experimental,

Merck NaCl was used for the electrolyte used during the etching. MCP M10-AD150−7 power supply was used as the power source. Merck Cu(NO3)2.3H2O, Zn(NO3)2.6H2O and Na2CO3 were used for the catalyst synthesis. Bruker AXS/Discovery D8 brand for XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) and Carl Zeiss/Gemini 300 SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) devices were used for the characterization. Merck methanol was used during the steam reforming. The obtained results were analyzed by GC-2014 Shimadzu with TCD detector. Helium was used as carrier gas in the device at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. Column temperature was used constant at 40 °C without ramp. Detector and injector temperature was set to 150 °C and 45 °C respectively. Samples were analyzed with stainless steel column (HAYESEP D100/120−10ftx1/8′'). The analysis was completed in 6 min. 3 mass flow controllers were used for gas calibration (CO, CO2, H2- Bronkhorst High-Tech/F201CM-40K-AAD-88-K). Methanol conversion was analyzed by Perkin Elmer FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy)."
3,Reactor design,"2.2 Reactor design Electro-etching method was chosen for the manufacture of the microreactor to be used in methanol steam reforming. First of all, vinyl mask was applied on the metal. The desired channel pattern is engraved on the vinyl mask by a laser marker. The following steps are schematized in Fig. 1 . Before manufacturing of the microreactor, a series of experiments were carried out. The effect of experiment initial parameters on the channel depth and width in the microreactor was investigated. As a result of the obtained data, 0.6 M NaCl(aq) electrolyte concentration was used and electrolytic etching was performed for 10 and 15 min at 15 V direct current with 10 cm electrode distance."
4,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.3 Catalyst preparation and characterization The catalyst content in methanol steam reformation was based on the Cu/ZnO catalyst that Kim and Kwon described as the best in their work [13]. Two different methods were followed for catalyst production. The first of these the spray pyrolysis method that allows the formation and coating of the catalyst directly on the surface of the micro reactor. The other method is the production by co-precipitation method and then the coating of the micro reactor with the dip coating method. In the spray pyrolysis method, 5.26 g Cu(NO3)2.3H2O and 2.28 g Zn(NO3)2.6H2O were dissolved in deionized water. The total solution was 40 g to synthesize the Cu/ZnO catalyst. The solution was left under vigorous stirring at room temperature. Completely homogeneous solution was taken into the solution tank in the system. The system setup is shown in Fig. 2 . The surface temperature was controlled by the PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controller and kept constant at 375 °C. The carrier gas flow to the system was provided by a compressor. The carrier gas pressure was set to 3 bar and the flow rate to 2.5 L/min. The diameter of the nozzle was chosen as 0.3 mm, and then the solution in the solution tank was sprayed onto the substrate. 0.49 g of catalyst coating was applied to the reactor as a result of the spray pyrolysis method. To obtain the same catalyst with the co-precipitation method, 1.8 M Na2CO3 solution were slowly added to 0.7 M Cu(NO3)2 and 0.3 M Zn(NO3)2 the solution mixture. During the precipitation process, the temperature was kept at 80 °C and the pH adjusted to 7.0. The resulting precipitate was washed with distilled water. The precipitate was then dried at 120 °C for 2 h and calcined at 350 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the obtaining catalyst was thoroughly dispersed in pure water. The sample plate was immersed in pure water dispersed catalyst using dip coating method. The surface contacting the catalyst was then kept at 300 °C. Thus, it was ensured that the catalyst was well fixed to the surface. This process was repeated 17 times until 0.49 g of catalyst weight obtained in spray pyrolysis was obtained. A comparison was made for the coating strength and durability of the catalysts coated substrates coated by different methods. For this purpose, the plates were immersed in a water and exposed to 200 W ultrasonic environment for 5 min for durability test. The weight of the spray pyrolysis and dip coating method applied plates was recorded before the ultrasonic tests. When the plates were dried and reweighed after the test, an average of 0.019 % change was observed in the plates treated with spray pyrolysis, while an average change of 0.51 % was observed in the plates applied with dip coating. The spray pyrolysis method was preferred over the dipping method with the advantage of coating strength as well as performing both synthesis and coating in one step. As seen from the Fig. 3 , while the plate coated with spray pyrolysis was still homogeneous after testing, the homogeneity of the plate coated with deep coating after co-precipitation decreased further. FTIR spectrophotometer was used to analyze the functional group of the CuO-ZnO nanocatalyst. The analysis of the functional groups of the nanocomposite was performed using the ATR technique in the frequency range of 4000−400 cm−1 and the results were shown in the Fig. 4 . Since the catalyst is obtained by spray pyrolysis, there are no −OH functional groups (3500−3000 cm−1), CO functional groups (1700−1600 cm−1) and C–H functional groups (2950−2850 cm−1) creating impurities for the present study. The Zn-O vibration of 432.05 cm−1 wavenumber is assigned to the Zn-O bond. The Cu-O vibration of 524.64 cm−1 wavenumber has also been assigned to the Cu-O bond [29]. The shift of wavenumber at a frequency of 750−400 cm-1 can be observed. The shifting of the wave number indicates that the composite formation can change according to the individual states of the structure. The Fig. 5 shows the XRD analysis results before the reduction of the CuO/ZnO catalyst structure prepared by the spray pyrolysis method. The XRD pattern of CuO-ZnO composite exhibits two main peaks of CuO and ZnO located at 38.8 and 47.5 degree corresponding to (111) and (102) planes, respectively. The broad and weak diffraction peaks outside of these peaks indicate small grain size and poor crystallinity [30]. ZnO in the structure is indexed as ZnO(100), ZnO(002), ZnO(101), ZnO(102), ZnO(110), ZnO(103), ZnO(200) at the peaks at 2θ = 32.5˚, 34.4˚, 36.3˚, 47.5˚, 56.9˚, 63.1˚, 66.8˚, respectively. Similarly, CuO in the structure is indexed as CuO(-111), CuO(111), CuO(-202), CuO(202), CuO(-113), CuO(-222) at the peaks of 2θ = 35.5˚, 38.8˚, 48.9˚, 58.5˚, 61.5˚, 75.25˚, respectively. CuO(220), ZnO(112) peaks are located at 2θ = 68.2˚, where CuO and ZnO structures are indexed at almost the same place [30–35]. In addition, since the catalyst is synthesized on the microreactor with spray pyrolysis, a weak aluminum peak is observed in the structure due to the reactor. The surface morphologies image of the nanoparticles on the coated surface characterized by SEM are shown in the Fig. 6 . Obtained coatings by spray pyrolysis appear very homogeneous. However, several clusters of cracks are also visible in the coating. These cracks arise from the presence of water in the precursor solutions used in the synthesis of the catalyst, and are caused by the effect of the water molecules removed from the system under the effect of heat. Therefore, removal of water or any other used solvent in thin film coatings occurs easily due to the thinness of the coating. Additionally, since the coating is very thin, the sintering conditions at all positions of the coating are similar. These cracks in the system also create a porous structure and increase the surface area of the coating."
5,Fabrication of microreactor,"2.4 Fabrication of microreactor Microchannels were formed on 5083 alloy aluminum plate by electro etching. Later, these channels were coated with the catalyst by the spray pyrolysis method. The bottom surface of the reactor is formed from the same unprocessed aluminum plate. The plates were combined in the last part of the production. The tightness test was carried out at 5 bar. The Fig. 7 shows the reactor used in the system."
6,Methanol steam reforming system,"2.5 Methanol steam reforming system Two plate resistances were mounted on both surfaces of the manufactured microreactor in order to provide different operating temperatures. In order to obtain the temperature, a signal the converter and a suitable thermocouple were used to control the reactor temperature. The plate resistances were mounted tightly to the reactor and a thermocouple was mounted between the reactor and the resistor. The system setup is given as in the Fig. 8 a syringe pump was used to provide feeding at different flow rates and S/C (Steam/Carbon) mole ratios. The reactor used in this study has 51 parallel micro channels. Reactor has a channel depth 0.29 mm, channel width 0.72 mm, surface area 143.39 cm2 and total channel volume 1.628 cm3. In addition, a reactor with a channel depth 0.23 mm, a channel width 0.56 mm, a surface area 121.05 cm2 and a total channel volume 1.099 cm3 was also used in a few preliminary trials. However, since the results were both better and more stable in the large-volume reactor, the experiments were carried out only with this reactor. In the study, the effect of reactor temperature, S/C ratio and feed rate on methanol conversion and H2% were investigated. The methanol-water mixture, which was not reacted in the reactor, was collected from the condensers. Afterwards, the unreacted methanol was found from the calibration graph obtained according to the related study [36]. The calibration graph is available in the supplementary. On the other hand, the gas mixture obtained was kept in a gas capturing bag. The mixture was then analyzed by a gas chromatography. Helium was used as a carrier gas in chromatography. The areas under the GC chromatogram were obtained by working at mass flow rates corresponding to different mole ratios. Separate calibration curves were then obtained for each compound. With the obtained calibration curves, the percentages of the components in the product were found from individual calibration curves and checked (total percentage must be 100) according to a similar study [37]. The calibration graph is available in the supplementary."
7,Results and discussion,"It is obvious that homogeneity of the coating is important for reaction reliability. As mentioned in ""Catalyst preparation and characterization"" of the study, a homogeneous coating was obtained with spray pyrolysis. Thus, similar conditions were achieved while the reaction took place at the catalyst surface throughout the reactor. The parameters studied for the reaction are described follows. As seen in Fig. 9 , the increase in reactor temperature at constant steam/carbon ratio and constant feed rate has a significant effect on the %H2 content and conversion. A significant increase in methyl alcohol conversion and H2 production rate was observed with increasing reactor temperature. It has also been obtained in similar studies in the literature that most of the methanol is converted to H2 with the increase in temperature [38]. This behavior is typical of the relationship between methanol conversion and reaction temperature. It is consistent with the well-known effects of temperature on reaction rates. It appears that the difference between methanol conversions produced at higher reaction temperatures and those obtained at lower temperatures is higher. This indicates a thermodynamic limitation in some role of the catalyst in the methanol-steam reforming reaction at low reaction temperatures. The results of the methanol conversion show that below the reaction temperature of 200 °C, the catalytic role of the catalyst is thermodynamically inhibited [39]. As a result, 94 % methanol conversion was obtained at 275 °C, while 9% methanol conversion was obtained at 175 °C. The methanol conversion and %H2 content measured as a function of feed rate are presented in Fig. 10 . More than 80 % conversion of methanol was obtained for a constant reactor temperature of 250 °C and a feed rate ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 mL/min at 1.2 steam/carbon ratio. As the feed rate increased, the residence time of the reactant in the reactor decreased. Therefore, as the contact time with the catalyst decreased, the methanol conversion decreased. The hydrogen production rate increased up to a point with the methanol feed rate. However, compared with the ideal hydrogen production rate, the slope of the actual hydrogen production rate decreased as the methanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity decreased with increasing methanol feed rate. The decrease in conversion also reduced the mass flow of the product. Fig. 11 shows the methanol conversion and H2 molar fraction at various steam/carbon molar ratios when the reaction temperature and feed flow rate are 250 °C and 0.02 mL/min, respectively. The methanol adsorbed on the catalyst surface is oxidized to generate species that later decompose into H2 and CO2 in the methanol reforming reaction. An increase in the S/C molar ratio at constant reactor temperature reduces the amount of methanol adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The heat in the reactor is given off with a small amount of methanol. Thus, it leads to an increase in methanol conversion. When the feed flow rate was kept constant and the steam/carbon ratio was increased, the CO2 and CO concentrations decreased. Thus, this situation increased the percentage content of H2 in the product. The S/C mole ratio was important for CO. This is because water plays an important role in the water-gas shift reaction. Enough water converted carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Thus, while the percentage of hydrogen increased, the percentage of CO decreased. In the kinetic study carried out on Cu-based catalysts, it has been shown that increasing the H2O/CH3OH molar ratio helps to reduce the CO2 and CO concentrations [40]. As a result, similar trends were observed in methanol conversion change and H2 content change with the increase of S/C mole ratio in the studied conditions. A significant reduction in carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide content was also observed. Considering the experiments, the best result was obtained in a reactor volume of 1628 cm3 with 94 % methanol conversion, the lowest CO (3%) content and the highest H2 content (69 %). The feed rate here is 0.02 mL/min, the S/C ratio is 1.8 and the reactor temperature is 275 °C."
8,Conclusions,"In this study, microreactors were manufactured by electro etching. Two different ways were followed for the catalyst preparation for coating the reactor. These methods were the production by co-precipitation method followed by conventional dip coating and the spray pyrolysis, which performed synthesis and coating in one step. In the ultrasonic durability test, it was determined that substrate was coated more homogeneously and spray coating did not deteriorate and showed a more robust coating feature. The manufactured reactors afterwards were coated with spray pyrolysis. Cu/ZnO structure was chosen as the catalyst. The effect of reactor volume, reactor temperature, S/C ratio and feed flow rate on methanol conversion and H2 mol % ratio was investigated for the spray catalyst coated reactors. As a result, an increasing in H2% and methanol conversion were observed with the increasing of the steam/carbon ratio and reaction temperature in the working range. An increasing in %methanol conversion was observed as the residence time increased with the decreasing in the feed rate. The methanol conversion and H2% content was found by the experiments under the various conditions. According to the obtained data, the best results; 94 % methanol conversion, 3% CO and 69 % H2 content, were obtained for the reactor volume of 1.626 cm3, reactor temperature of 275 °C, steam/carbon ratio of 1.8 and a feed rate of 0.02 cm3/min. These results obtained with a coating technique superior in terms of durability and homogeneity are in line with many good results in the literature [13,40–43]. In addition, as in traditional methods, long-term calcination times, the use of precipitation agents and coating equipment were not used, saving time and cost during the catalyst synthesis."
