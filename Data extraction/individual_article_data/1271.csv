0,Introduction,"As a result of intense economic development and urbanization, an increase in energy demand is inevitable. Many researchers have devoted their efforts to produce candidate renewable energy (Chandgude et al., 2021; López-Linares et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2014). Among the various energy carriers, butanol presents several advantages due to its higher energy density, lower corrosivity and lower solubility in aqueous phase (Ave and Adams, 2018). More importantly, butanol can be mixed with gasoline at any ratio without retrofitting the engine of vehicles, and it can also be transported through current pipelines (Luo et al., 2018; Raganati et al., 2014). Consequently, butanol is considered as an ideal candidate to substitute part of the current fossil fuel. Acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation is considered to be a promising technology for butanol production (Giacobbe et al., 2019). However, it is currently hampered by two bottlenecks: (1) the high cost of feedstock which accounts for 60% ~ 70% of the overall process cost; (2) the low butanol titer due to the strong inhibitory effect of products to cells (Claassen et al., 2000). To reduce the cost of feedstock, lots of waste biomass has been employed as substrate in ABE fermentation (Raganati et al., 2016; Khedkar et al., 2017; Procentese et al., 2019a). Among the waste biomass, food waste exhibits several advantages: (i) it is rich in starch and glucose which is essential to obtain high butanol titer (Kiran et al., 2014); (ii) the balanced nutrients of food waste favor the rapid growth of butanol-producing microorganisms; and (iii) it helps to reduce the cost of butanol (Huang et al., 2015). With these advantages, it is viable to develop an economically viable platform for butanol production. However, most of the organic substrates of food waste are in the form of macro fractions, such as rice and vegetables, which commonly result in a long lag phase of ABE fermentation (Zhang et al., 2013). To this end, it is essential to pretreat with food waste so that the macro fractions can be hydrolyzed into soluble monosaccharides. Previously, numerous pretreatment approaches had been developed to decompose cellulosic substrates, including physical, chemical and biological pretreatments (Wang et al., 2015a; Procentese et al., 2019b). However, most of the studies mainly focused on anaerobic digestion for the production of methane and hydrogen (Chen et al., 2020; Banu et al., 2020). Less was focused on butanol production from food waste (Liu et al., 2021). The influence of pretreatment of food waste on the ABE fermentation was unclear. ABE fermentation by solventogenic Clostridium species includes two distinct characteristic phases, acidogenesis and solventogenesis (Li et al., 2013; Raganati et al., 2014). The shift of the two phases is associated with many factors such as pH, temperature and acidity. Different strains response to these parameters in different ways. Moreover, the butanol-producing bacteria are not multifunctional, and can only use simple and easy-degradable carbohydrates as substrate due to lacking some key enzymes (Mai et al., 2017). Hence, most Clostridia are not capable of utilizing substrates directly when the organic wastes are used as feedstock (Jiang et al., 2017). The cooperation of different strain is deemed to be an effective way to overcome this problem (Wang et al., 2015b; Wu et al., 2019). To save the cost of downstream, it is extremely important to obtain high production of butanol, with half of the cost of product recovery saved if butanol titer increases from 12.0 to 19.0 g/L (Dürre, 2007). However, butanol is extremely toxic to cells due to its lipophilic property, preventing a high production of butanol (Xue et al., 2013). Several strategies have been proposed to overcome the inhibition issues, such as in-situ removing butanol through gas stripping, adsorption and extraction (Xue et al., 2012). A number of studies introduced that a butanol separation via in-situ extraction was an effective approach to obtain high ABE productivity (Cai et al., 2016, 2017). Particularly, liquid-liquid extraction has attracted lots of attention, because inhibitors could dissolve into the extracting agent with high partition coefficient. Among the tested agents, oleyl alcohol is a popular one due to its non-toxic property and high partition coefficient toward butanol. Most of the previous studies were conducted using the synthesized medium as substrate. However, food waste is a complex substrate where the inhibitors (such as oil) are always found. The influence of oleyl alcohol extraction on the alleviation of inhibitors during ABE fermentation was not yet studied. In this study, three technologies were therefore employed for the efficient butanol production from food waste, including substrate pretreatment, co-culture fermentation and in-situ oleyl alcohol extraction. The synergetic effect of these technologies on the improvement of butanol production was finally examined, so that the most favorable conditions can be selected in the future process scale-up. The objectives of this study were therefore threefold: (1) determine the optimum pretreatment method for food waste; (2) evaluate the performance of ABE fermentation using co-cultures; (3) assess the influence of oleyl alcohol extraction on ABE fermentation of food waste."
1,Material and methods,
2,Food waste and microbes,"2.1 Food waste and microbes Food waste was collected from the second student canteen of Jiangsu University at lunch time. The impurities of food waste, such as plastic and big bones, were removed manually. Then the food waste was ground into small particles (<3 mm) by a mill (SS3300, Waste King in USA). Thereafter, food waste was stored in a fridge with temperature of -20 °C. Two butanol-producing strains of C. acetobutylicum CICC 8009 and C. pasteurianum CICC 8017 were supplied by China Center of Industrial Culture Collection (CICC). The cultivation medium comprised of 60 g/L glucose, buffer (2.2 g/L ammonium acetate, 0.5 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L K2HPO4), vitamins (1.0 mg/L of p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.01 mg/L of biotin) and mineral salts (0.2 g/L MgSO4, 10 mg/L MnSO4, 10 mg/L FeSO4). The serum bottles with a volume of 100 mL were used for butanol fermentation. After addition of the nutrients except for vitamins, all the serum bottles were incubated in boiling water bath for 10 min. Then they cooled down to the room temperature under a 100% nitrogen gas atmosphere. The bottles were then sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminous caps to maintain an anaerobic environment. After autoclaving, the vitamin from an anoxic and filter-sterilized stock solution prepared under 100% nitrogen gas was injected into the fermenter. The pH was adjusted to 6.8 ± 0.1 before addition of 10% inoculum. The serum bottles were put on a shaker (HYLC, Qiangle Experimental equipment Co., Ltd., Taicang, China) with a speed of 108 rpm and constant temperature of 37 °C. The two strains were both cultivated for five generations before being used as inoculum. The final OD600 of C. acetobutylicum and C. pasteurianum was 1.9 ± 0.2 and 2.0 ± 0.2, respectively."
3,Experimental design and startup,"2.2 Experimental design and startup 2.2.1 Batch fermentation of pretreated food waste To investigate the influence of pretreatment of food waste on ABE fermentation, four different approaches were for the pretreatment of food waste: (i) ultrasonic pretreatment, where the food waste was put into an ultrasonic environment (20 KHz) for 20 min; (2) acidic pretreatment, where the pH of food waste was adjusted to 1.0 using HCl and then kept the low pH for 24 h; (3) enzymatic pretreatment. Two stages of enzymatic hydrolysis were applied. At the first stage, 400 U/g alpha-amylase was used to hydrolyze food waste after the pH was adjusted to 6.0 ± 0.1. Hydrolysis was conducted for 24 h at 50 °C. At the second stage, 150 U/g glucoamylase was employed for further hydrolysis of food waste with the pH of 4.0 ± 0.1. Hydrolysis was carried out at 60 °C for 12 h; (4) heat pretreatment. Boil the food waste for 30 min. After pretreatment, all the pH of the pretreated food waste was adjusted to 7.0 using NaOH solution (2 mol/L). All batch tests were carried out in 100 mL serum bottles using mono culture of C. acetobutylicum. For each bottle, food waste with a loading of 30 g volatile solid (VS) per liter medium was added into the fermenter instead of glucose. The concentration of buffer, vitamins and mineral salts were the same with the cultivation medium described in Section 2.1. After addition of food waste and nutrition, the distilled water was added into the serum bottles to make the medium of each bottle be the same (50 mL). The methods of creating anaerobic environment, vitamin addition, pH adjustment and inoculum amount were the same with cultivation methods described in Section 2.1. The total fermentative time for each group was designed as 96 h. To detect the concentration of ABE produced by microorganism, liquid samples were collected per 12 h during the fermentative process. All the groups were conducted in duplicate. 2.2.2 Influence of co-culture fermentation on ABE production using glucose as substrate To determine the optimum ratio of the two strains, the strain ratios of C. acetobutylicum / C. pasteurianum were designed as 1:9, 3:7, 5:5, 7:3 and 9:1, respectively. Fermentation by mono-culture was also conducted as control group, and their ratios were named as 0:10 (C. pasteurianum) and 10:0 (C. acetobutylicum), respectively. The medium was the same as that used in cultivation described in section 2.1. 2.2.3 ABE fermentation of pretreated food waste by co-cultures With the optimum pretreatment method and co-culture ratio, ABE fermentation of food waste was carried out to evaluate performance of co-culture fermentation. In addition, in order to determine the optimum loading of food waste, three loadings of food waste were designed, being 30, 60 and 90 gVS/L, respectively. The methods for fermentation (except for the loading of food waste) were the same with that of section 2.2.1. 2.2.4 Oleyl alcohol extraction for butanol improvement Based on the results of section 2.2.3, 20 mL oleyl alcohol was added into the serum bottle at the optimum load of food waste. During the whole fermentation process, the serum bottles were put on the shaker to achieve the in-situ extraction of butanol produced by co-culture. Liquid samples were only collected at the final of fermentation to determine the amount of ABE and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) distributed in organic and aqueous phases."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The VFAs of the liquid samples were measured by GC (GC2010 plus, SHIMADZU, Japan), using a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column (Agilent 1909/ N-133HP-INNOWAX 30 m × 0.25 mm). The temperatures of the injection port and FID were 240 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The temperature program of the column was: 60 °C for 3.0 min; increased to 90 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min and maintained for 1.0 min; increased to 165 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min and maintained for 2.0 min; increased to 230 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min and maintained for 2.0 min. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas. The flow rates of nitrogen, hydrogen and air were 35, 40 and 400 mL/min, respectively (Zhang et al., 2017). To determine the concentration of glucose, VFAs, and pH during dark fermentation, the liquid samples were collected in liquid phase. The pH value was measured by a pH meter (pHB-1, Shanghai Sanxin, China). The concentration of glucose was determined by the 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (Bao et al., 2012). Total protein was determined by Kjeltec Nitrogen Analyzer."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis The data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation. One-Way ANOVA for analysis of variance and Duncan test as post hoc was used with a confidence interval of 95% (p < 0.05). All analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS statistical package version 20.0 (IBM, New York, USA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characteristics of food waste,"3.1 Characteristics of food waste The characteristics of food waste are shown in Table 1 . The VS accounts for 96.7% of the total solid (TS), illustrating that most of the substrates of food waste can be decomposed by microorganism. Starch and glucose are largely present in food waste at concentrations of 41.9% and 5.7% (on dry basis), respectively. Both can be utilized as carbon sources by solvent-producing bacteria. Moreover, the high content of protein (12.3%) indicates that food waste is a resource which is rich in nitrogen source. Food waste exhibits acidic property due to the existence of VFAs especially of acetate. These characteristics demonstrate that food waste is an alternative substrate for ABE fermentation."
8,Influence of pretreatment of food waste on butanol production,"3.2 Influence of pretreatment of food waste on butanol production Fig. 1 shows the influence of pretreatment on food waste hydrolysis and butanol fermentation. Results showed that the ABE production was influenced by the pretreatment significantly (p < 0.05), and all the pretreatments helped to improve the hydrolysis of food waste. The highest glucose concentration (185.6 g/L) was obtained in the group with the enzymatic pretreatment. Correspondingly, the highest butanol production of 1.5 g/L was obtained in the same group. In contrast, no improvement on butanol production was observed in the group with acidic pretreatment. Thus, enzymatic pretreatment was the preferable approach for food waste hydrolysis. The mechanisms of different pretreatment are different, e.g., ultrasonic pretreatment utilizes the shear force generated by sonication and heat pretreatment depends on the high temperature (Kiyoshi et al., 2015). In this study, starch dominated the carbohydrate of the food waste. The glucose concentration of the control was 21.3 g/L. With ultrasonic and heat pretreatments, the release of glucose from the solid fraction to the liquid fraction may have occurred, resulting in the increase of glucose concentration. In contrast, starch was catalyzed by alpha-amylase and glucoamylase with the generation of glucose, where alpha-amylase cuts alpha-1, 4 - glucoside bonds of amylose or amylopectin and glucoamylase cuts alpha-1, 6 - glucoside bonds. The synergistic action of the two enzymes promoted the hydrolysis of starch. Unfortunately, the butanol production decreased in the group with acidic pretreatments. It was noteworthy that the concentration of sodium remarkably increased during pH adjustment. The high concentration of sodium might have negatively affected the metabolism of bacteria, resulting in low the butanol production."
9,Co-culture fermentation for the improvement of butanol production,"3.3 Co-culture fermentation for the improvement of butanol production Although the butanol production was enhanced by pretreatment of food waste, the production of butanol and total solvent were much lower than that reported previously (Qin et al., 2018). To improve the solvent titer, ABE fermentation by two cultures (C. acetobutylicum and C. pasteurianum) was conducted. Fig. 2 shows that the maximum butanol titers of mono-cultures of C. pasteurianum and C. acetobutylicum were 10.5 and 8.2 g/L, respectively. In contrast, the butanol production was significantly improved by co-cultures (p < 0.05). The maximum butanol production (13.2 g/L) was obtained with the microbial ratio of 7:3 (C. acetobutylicum /C. pasteurianum). Compared with the mono-cultures of C. pasteurianum and C. acetobutylicum, the butanol production of the co-culture was improved by 25.7% and 61.0%, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the results of solvent production during the ABE fermentation process. Sharp decrease of glucose was observed after the startup of fermentation. The glucose was consumed for the cell growth and the production of acetate and butyrate, resulting in the pH decrease. Although the lag phases of mono-culture and co-culture systems were both 12 h, the maximum butanol titers were different (p < 0.05), being 10.5 g/L for C. pasteurianum, 8.2 g/L for C. acetobutylicum and 13.2 g/L for co-cultures, respectively. Moreover, the highest solvent production of 23.0 g/L was obtained in the co-culture system. These fermentative data illustrated that the butanol and solvent titers were improved by co-culture fermentation. The improvement of solvent production caused by co-culture fermentation in this study was in agreement with the previous reports. Wang et al. (2015b) isolated two new strains (consortium N3 and C. celevecrescens N3-2) which use cellulose as substrate and produce a considerable amount of butanol. Thereafter they obtained a high butanol titer of 3.7 g/L using the co-cultures of new bacteria and C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (Wang et al., 2015b). Similar results were also reported by Kiyoshi et al. (2015), where a butanol production of 5.5 g/L was achieved by co-cultures (cellulolytic C. thermocellum NBRC 103400 and butanol-producing C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4) in converting rice straw to butanol. In this study, two butanol-producing strains were utilized. The butanol production of co-culture fermentation remarkably increased compared with mono-culture, proving that fermentation by co-cultures was an effective way for the improvement of butanol production."
10,Anaerobic fermentation of pretreated food waste by co-cultures,"3.4 Anaerobic fermentation of pretreated food waste by co-cultures To improve the butanol production of food waste, anaerobic fermentation of pretreated food waste was conducted using co-cultures, as shown in Fig. 4 . With the loading of 30 gVS/L, a butanol titer of 2.4 g/L (Fig. 4a) was obtained, which was 1.6 times higher than that of mono-culture (1.5 g/L, Fig. 1). These results further proved that co-culture fermentation was an effective way to improve the butanol production. The maximum butanol titers of 60 and 90 gVS/L were both 3.1 g/L, and the corresponding solvent titers were 5.1 and 5.3 g/L, respectively (Fig. 4b and c). These results indicated that the butanol production was not improved via increasing substrate concentration when the loading exceeded 60 g/L. With the increase of acetate and butyrate, the pH decreased from 6.8 to the value around 5.1. The high acetate and butyrate concentrations and low pH promoted the shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis phases. The produced acetate and butyrate were used by Clostridia to produce ABE, resulting in a sharp increase of solvent and butanol during hours 12-24 (Fig. 4). Acetate and butyrate were the main by-products (Table 2 ). The concentration of acetate and butyrate increased significantly (p < 0.05) with the increase of organic load. The high concentrations of acetate and butyrate agreed with the metabolic pathway of Clostridia (Zheng et al., 2015). However, this phenomenon indicated that a considerable amount of food waste was converted into VFAs rather than ABE. Hence, further measures need to be taken for the conversion of food waste to butanol."
11,Improvement of butanol production via oleyl alcohol extraction,"3.5 Improvement of butanol production via oleyl alcohol extraction Pretreatment of food waste and co-culture fermentation could remarkably improve butanol production. However, as an energy carrier, butanol should be produced in a cost-effective way with high productivity to compete with other commercial fuels. Although an improvement of the butanol production was achieved via pretreatment of food waste and co-culture fermentation, the butanol titer of food waste was still lower in comparison with the data reported previously (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, butanol is toxic to butanol-producing bacteria when its concentration increased to a very low level (<5 g/L) (Xue et al., 2012). Liquid-liquid extraction was an alternative approach to overcome the inhibition caused by butanol, because butanol can easily be dissolved in the extractant in comparison with aqueous phase (Lee et al., 2008). In this study, oleyl alcohol was applied as extractant to reduce the inhibition by butanol. Results showed that ABE and VFAs were observed in both the organic and the aqueous phases (Table 3 ). The practical distribution ratio of organic to aqueous (O/A) phases was 2.6 for butanol, illustrating that butanol exhibited a higher solubility in the organic than that of the aqueous phase. The corresponding total butanol and solvent titers were 12.5 and 21.7 g/L, respectively. Compared with the data of Fig. 4b, the butanol production was improved by three times. These results illustrated the inhibitory effect of butanol was remarkably alleviated through oleyl alcohol extraction. Moreover, the accumulated acetate and butyrate are toxic to microorganisms as well. With addition of oleyl alcohol, most of butyrate was synchronously separated from the aqueous phase, leading to the mitigation of the inhibitory effect caused by butyrate. It was therefore concluded that the extraction of butanol and butyrate was the main reason for butanol production improvement."
12,Discussion,"3.6 Discussion All the three technologies used in this study contributed to the improvement of butanol production. The enzymatic pretreatment improved the butanol production from 0.1 to 1.5 g/L. The production of 3.1 g/L was obtained when co-culture fermentation was applied. A final production of 12.5 g/L was achieved using oleyl alcohol extraction. Hence, the contribution on the butanol production of the three technologies could be listed in the order: enzymatic pretreatment > oleyl alcohol extraction > co-culture fermentation. The butanol production of food waste without co-culture and oleyl alcohol extraction was low, indicating it is essential for food waste to be hydrolyzed prior to ABE fermentation. Oleyl alcohol is an effective extractant for in-situ extraction to improve butanol production. The boiling point of oleyl alcohol is in the range of 205-210 °C, which is remarkably higher than that of butanol (117.5 °C), implying that the extracted butanol can be easily separated with oleyl alcohol using distillation. In the in-situ fermentation system, a large amount of oleyl alcohol was applied to extract butanol, where 20 mL oleyl alcohol was used per 55 mL broth in the serum bottle. From an economic point of view, it is essential to recover the oleyl alcohol to save the cost of extractant. Further studies need to focus on the technology of separating butanol from oleyl alcohol, and the economic performance of the extraction technology needs to be addressed. Food waste is a viable alternative substrate for butanol production not only due to the high content of carbohydrates but also because of its high concentration of protein which serves as nitrogen source instead of yeast extract, allowing the cost-effective way to produce solvent. However, food waste also contains high concentration of oil. The unsaturated moieties such as oleic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2) were found to perform negative influence on the growth of microorganism and product yield (Chatzifragkou et al., 2010). The inhibitory effect of oil is inevitable in the case that food waste is used as feedstock in ABE fermentation. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the oil from food waste physically before fermentation. Moreover, the oil in the fermentation broth would also dissolve into oleyl alcohol, resulting in a low concentration of oil in the fermentation broth. In addition, oleyl alcohol selectively extracts the butanol and butyrate in the in-situ extraction system, which will alleviate the inhibitory effect caused by butanol and butyrate. Thus, the extraction of inhibitors explained the high butanol production of the in-situ extraction fermentation. Application of advanced technologies is essential to improve the production of butanol because ABE fermentation can not only be influenced by the chemical composition of food waste but also by several environmental factors. For instance, Abd-Alla et al. (2017) studied the influence of strain type and substrate on ABE fermentation using food processing waste. They found that C. beijerinckii ASU10 could produce the highest butanol production (11.0 g/L), while C. chauvoei ASU12 exhibited a high capacity in producing acetate and butyrate. A shift from butanol to ethanol production was observed when whey was used as substrate. Huang et al. (2015) used food waste rich in carbohydrates such as potatoes, sweet corn and white bread, obtaining high butanol and solvent production of 12.3 and 18.9 g/L, respectively. In a study of Qin et al. (2018), a production of 5.2 g/L was obtained in batch test. To improve the solvent production, they added 3 g/L of CaCO3 and 0.5% Tween 80 in the fermentation broth, and moreover, the liquid-liquid extraction with biodiesel was also applied. A final butanol production of 35.6 g/L was achieved in fed-batch fermentation. These studies also verified that food waste is a potential substrate for ABE production, whereas the advanced technologies should be applied for the cost-effective butanol production."
13,Conclusions,"Butanol was successfully produced from the pretreated food waste with assistance of substrate pretreatment, co-culture fermentation and oleyl alcohol extraction. The butanol production of food waste was finally improved to 12.5 g/L. The contribution on butanol production of the three technologies was listed in the order: enzymatic pretreatment > oleyl alcohol extraction > co-culture fermentation. The alleviation of inhibition caused by butanol and butyrate explained the improvement of butanol production. This study illustrated that the combination of the three technologies were effective ways for the conversion of food waste to butanol."
