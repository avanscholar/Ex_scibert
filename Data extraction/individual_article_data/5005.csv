0,Introduction,"Present production of hydrogen in the large scale is based mainly on the fossil fuels and the steam methane reforming [1], which is at the moment justified economically. Amongst new methods based on “green technology”, hydrogen production in the biological processes can play a significant role in the near future. Here, the fermentative decomposition of organic compounds, biophotolysis of water with algae and cyanobacteria, application of photosynthetic bacteria as well as hybrid systems (dark fermentation + photofermentation) are considered as the most promising methods [2–4]. One of the advantages of these methods is a possibility of simultaneous hydrogen production and removal of the majority of organic wastes from e.g. food industry. The wastes from sugar industry, breweries, dairies and biofuels production (e.g. glycerol) as well as organic municipal wastes, can be applied as the source of organic carbon in fermentative hydrogen generation [5–7]. In sequential dark and photo-fermentation systems, metabolites formed in dark fermentation process can be further transferred into photobioreactors and used in photofermentation process. The application of hybrid systems significantly improves the yield of generated biohydrogen [8–10]. In the fermentative processes the conversion of simple organic compounds into hydrogen, carbon dioxide and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) occurs in the presence of anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacter [9,11], Clostridium [11] or Bacillus [12]. The theoretical yield of fermentative hydrogen from glucose, when it is completely converted into acetic acid, is 4 moL H2/molglucose [13]. This yield is low from economical point of view. Moreover, the yield would be even lower if wastes from food industry are applied, as they do not contain only simple sugars. On the other hand, the transformation of 1 mol of acetate in photofermentative process gives 8 mol of hydrogen. Thus, combination of these two kinds of fermentation could theoretically give 12 mol H2 per 1 mol of glucose [9,14]. Photoheterotrophic bacteria (e.g. R. sphaeroides O.U.001) require both light energy and the simple organic compounds for their growth and metabolism. Therefore, these bacteria under illumination efficiently transform metabolites of dark fermentation - simple organic acids and alcohols. Photofermentation process takes place in anaerobic conditions, in the absence of atmospheric nitrogen and/or ammonia ions, at pH close to 7.0 and temperature 27–35 °C. If molecular nitrogen is present in the environment of photofermentative bacteria, it could be reduced to ammonia by nitrogenase enzyme. Photoreduction of protons to molecular hydrogen occurs under nitrogen limitation conditions [15]. Simultaneously with the reduction of protons by nitrogenase, the hydrogenase enzyme acts as the hydrogen consuming (oxidation) catalyst. Finally, the amount of photogenerated hydrogen is the difference between H2 produced by nitrogenase and consumed by hydrogenase [2]. In order to increase the amount of microbiologically produced hydrogen, the hybrid systems were proposed [16,17]. In the first step, hydrocarbons are transformed during dark fermentation process into hydrogen, organic acids and alcohols. Afterwards, these compounds are further transformed by photosynthetic bacteria into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The consumption of confectionery products has grown tremendously in recent years. The global retail value sales of chewing gum in 2014 was 25 billion dollars [18]. Annually 1.74 trillion sticks of chewing gum are produced [19], which is associated with high production of waste. Large amounts of solid wastes originating from chewing gum production are at present burned. This paper shows that these wastes can be utilized in sequential dark and photo-fermentation for biohydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Microorganisms and culture media,"2.1 Microorganisms and culture media Anaerobic digested sludge from municipal purification unit (city of Poznań, Poland) was applied as the source of microorganisms (inoculum) for the first stage of fermentation. The sludge was boiled for 15 min to inhibit methanogenic activity [20,21]. Different amounts of solid waste from chewing gum production were placed in water and the suspension was heated at 60 °C with vigorous stirring for 5 min. The HPLC analysis indicated the presence of the following organic compounds in the solution after heating: xylitol (32%), talha gum (66%), glycerol (0.8%), aspartame (0.3%) and traces of maltitol and unidentified compounds. Each medium in the form of suspension containing 16, 33, 50, 67, 100 or 133 g/L of waste was enriched with the following compounds (per liter): 1 g NaHCO3, 0.5 g NH4Cl, 0.25 g KH2PO4, 0.25 g K2HPO4, 0.32 g MgSO4⋅4H2O and set of microelements − 0.005 g FeCl3, 0.0032 g NiSO4, 0.005 g CaCl2, 0.0007 g Na2B4O7⋅H2O, 0.0023 g ZnCl2, 0.0021 g CoCl3⋅H2O, 0.001 g CuCl2⋅2H2O, 0.003 g MnCl2⋅4H2O and 0.0014 g (NH4)6Mo7O24⋅H2O [20]. The photoheterotrophic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides O.U.001 (ATCC 49419) were applied in photofermentation process and cultivated in Van Niel's medium containing (per liter): 1 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g MgSO4, 10 g yeast extract. Activation was performed according to the procedure already described in literature [3]."
3,Fermentation conditions,"2.2 Fermentation conditions Hydrogen production tests in the dark fermentation process were performed in 60 mL glass vials with butyl rubber septa. The total working volume of enriched chewing gum waste was 30 mL. Three different concentrations of inoculum (2.5 or 6.4 or 11.8 g dry wt/L) were applied in three sets of the dark fermentation process. Initial pH was adjusted to 5.5. Samples after deaeration with argon were sealed and incubated with agitation at 37 °C until hydrogen evolution ceased. Photofermentation process was carried out in 25 mL vials made of sodium glass, with working capacity of 12.5 mL. Hydrogen production was performed at 28 ± 2 °C in modified Biebl and Phennig medium [3]. Here, malic acid (2 g/L) and sodium glutamate (0.36 g/L) were applied as the sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. Medium was inoculated with 30 vol% of R. sphaeroides bacteria (0.36 g dry wt/L). In experiments with chewing gum waste, the effluent originating from the dark fermentation process (after centrifugation at 12500 rpm) replaced malic acid in modified Biebl and Phennig medium. After sterilization of the medium all samples in photofermentation process were flushed with argon and sealed with butyl rubber septa. Initial pH was between 7.0 and 7.2. In all experiments, the mercury-tungsten lamps (Ultra-Vitalux 300W from Osram) provided light intensity of about 116 W/m2. During both dark and photofermentation experiments, each point was measured in triplicate (three separate vials)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Gas chromatography (Varian 3800 equipped with TCD and capillary column CARBOPLOT P7) was applied for measurements of hydrogen and carbon dioxide content. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 8.5 mL/min. Temperature of injector, column and detector were 115, 85 and 110 °C, respectively. Gases were collected over the surface of liquid and introduced onto TCD detector with gas-tight syringe. Liquid metabolites (mainly VFAs) were analyzed with HPLC (Ultimate 3000 from Dionex). Each sample before the HPLC analysis was centrifuged for 15 min at 12500 rpm. The consumption of organic compounds was monitored with chemical oxygen demand method (COD) [22], while total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) were measured in accordance with the standard methods [22]. Ammonium ions concentration was measured applying MERCK spectroquant method (ammonium test 1.14752, absorption measurements at 690 nm). The intensity of illuminance was measured at the external walls of glass vials with luxometer TES 1335 (in klx) and pyranometer CMP3 Kipp &Zonen (in W/m2). The modified Gompertz equation was applied for calculations of cumulative amounts of hydrogen and carbon dioxide [20,23]. H = H max exp { − exp [ R max , H 2 e H max ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where: H - cumulative hydrogen (L/Lmedium), Hmax – maximum cumulative hydrogen (L/Lmedium), Rmax, H2 –maximum rate of hydrogen production (L/L/h), t – fermentation time (h), λ – lag time (h). Gompertz equation was applied also for calculation of kinetic parameters of CO2 production."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrogen production in dark fermentation,"3.1 Hydrogen production in dark fermentation No difference in hydrogen production between centrifuged and not centrifuged suspension of waste was observed. Therefore in further experiments waste suspension used in dark fermentation was not centrifuged. Initially, experiments with three different concentrations of inoculum − 2.5, 6.4 and 11.8 g dry wt/L (10 vol%, 25 vol% and 50 vol%) and constant concentration of chewing gum waste (67 g/Lmedium) were performed. In this set of experiments the highest hydrogen production was achieved with 25 vol% of inoculum. Data presented in Table 1 show that in this case the volume of produced hydrogen was 0.36 L H2/Lmedium. Simultaneously, the COD removal was the highest, indicating almost 30% utilization of organic compounds. Moreover, an increase of TS (2.3 g/L) and VS (2.6 g/L) for 25 vol% inoculum was low compared to 50 vol% inoculum, what could indicate different metabolism of microorganisms. In consequence the specific yield of hydrogen (6.2 mmoL H2/g VS) and substrate yield (0.24 mmoL H2/g waste) appeared to be the highest. Other tests with systems containing different concentration of chewing gum waste (16, 33, 50, 67, 100 or 133 g/Lmedium) showed the highest production of hydrogen for sample containing 67 g waste per liter of medium (Fig. 1 ). Experiments with wastes at lower concentration showed it was not sufficient for efficient H2 production during fermentation process. When the waste in concentration of 100 or 133 g/L was applied the amount of produced hydrogen decreased to 0.18 and 0.12 L/Lmedium, respectively. This effect could be observed due to substrate inhibition. Kotay et al. observed the substrate inhibition studying dark fermentation of glucose by Bacillus coagulans [24]. They demonstrated a significant decrease of hydrogen production with glucose concentration higher than 20 g/L. Data presented in Table 2 show the yields of hydrogen at different concentration of waste (calculated for CODremoval, VS increase and weight of waste). Although our hydrogen yields are much lower than those obtained for glucose (2–14 mmoL H2/g) [25–27] or starch (7–12 mmoL H2/g) [4,10,28], our results should not be compared with these model compounds. However, when we consider other groups working with wastes, our system was of comparable efficiency. Studies by Fan et al. [29] with brewery waste water showed yield of 1.9 mmoL H2/g COD and this value is very similar to our results (e.g. 1.6–1.8 mmoL H2/g CODremoved). Mohan et al. [30] when studying combined mixture of different types of chemical wastewaters collected from a common effluent treatment plant obtained yields of 0.2–1.2 mmoL H2/g COD. A similar comparison can be performed for solid wastes. Earlier studies showed that household solid waste [31] or food wastes [32,33] can give yields of 1.9–2.0 mmoL H2/g VS and 3.6–5.6 mmoL H2/g VS, respectively. Data presented in Table 2 show that our yields are higher than those presented by other authors. The highest yields of hydrogen were obtained for experiments with concentrations of 67 and 100 g waste/L. For these two concentrations the kinetic studies were performed. Typical kinetic curves representing changes in H2, CO2 and pH values are shown on Fig. 2 . Results were modeled according to the Gompertz equation (see Table 3 ). Similarly to kinetic studies presented by other authors, we observed the typical relationship between concentration of substrate, maximum H2 production rate and lag time duration. The experimental results show that, the lower the lag time, the higher the H2 production rate and the amount of evolved hydrogen. Studies performed by Su et al. with raw cassava starch indicated H2 production rate between 0.018 and 0.021 L H2/h and lag time close to 11 h [4]. In contrast, dark fermentation processes performed with cellulose showed a low reaction rate but short lag time (4.6 h) [34]. Fermentation of organic wastes originating from rice and potatoes resulted in a very long lag time (54–100 h) and a very low H2 production rate (0.004–0.012 L/L/h) [23]. Comparing our results with those reported by other authors one can conclude that kinetic parameters in dark fermentation process strongly depend on the type and concentration of the substrate. Both the hydrogen production rate and the lag time obtained in our experiments were comparable with the values presented in other studies. Dark fermentation effluent can be applied as the source of organic carbon for photofermentation. Therefore, the detailed analysis of the filtered effluent from dark fermentation (at the end of the process) was performed by HPLC technique. Table 5 shows the concentrations of the basic components of effluent before and after dark fermentation when 67 g waste/L was applied. These results indicate that during dark fermentation a significant decrease in concentration of the Talha gum and glycerol took place. Simultaneously, such metabolites as acetic, propionic, butyric and lactic acids can be found in the effluent. However, xylitol concentration (the main component found in the solution of initial waste) after process did not change, thus it was not utilized by bacteria. The results showing the concentrations of metabolites in the effluents obtained at different concentrations of the waste are presented in Table 4. The concentration of VFAs increased in dark fermentation almost in all tested systems, whereas the amount of glycerol decreased. Our earlier studies [20] also showed that glycerol can be effectively applied in hydrogen production in dark fermentation process. Relatively high microbiological activity in dark fermentation towards hydrogen production from chewing gum industry wastes, as well as high concentration of xylitol and VFAs found in the effluents from dark fermentation, prompted us to apply a sequential dark and photo-fermentation system for hydrogen production."
7,Photofermentative hydrogen production,"3.2 Photofermentative hydrogen production Dark fermentation effluent, which contained mainly xylitol and VFAs, were studied in three series of photofermentation experiments. Data in Table 6 show the influence of initial medium concentration and the effect of its dilution on the yield of hydrogen and CO2 in photofermentation. High concentration of ammonium ions in the effluent (480 mg of NH4 +/Lmedium containing 67 g of waste/L) practically eliminated photoproduction of hydrogen (see Table 6). In all cases the dilution of the effluent resulted in significant improvement of hydrogen yield. This effect was caused by lowering nitrogen compounds concentration in photofermentation medium. The absence of molecular nitrogen or nitrogen compounds in photofermentation medium directed nitrogenase activity towards protons reduction, i.e. hydrogen production [15]. Argun et al. [8] in experiments with subsequent fermentation and photofermentation of wheat powder established that 6-fold dilution of the initial concentration of medium led to significant increase in hydrogen yield. In order to improve the hydrogen yield by removal of ammonia they also applied the overnight saturation with air. Kinetics of the photofermentation process for the most efficient concentrations of waste in dark fermentation (67 g/L and 100 g/L) are shown in Fig. 3 , whereas data in Table 7 present Gompertz kinetic parameters for different dilutions of dark fermentation effluent. Comparison of the kinetic results obtained for dark fermentation (Fig. 3) shows that photofermentation was characterized by higher hydrogen production than the dark process. Hydrogen production reached 0.8 L/L of diluted (1:8) dark fermentation effluent (for experiments with initial concentration of 67 g waste/L) (Table 6). This amount would correspond to a potential value of 6.4 L/L of non-diluted fermentation effluent. Thus, the total amount of hydrogen produced in the most efficient sequential dark and photo-fermentation experiment was close to 6.7 L/L of non-diluted waste. Initially, pH during photofermentation increased to 8.5. Then pH began to decline with simultaneous rapid production of hydrogen. After 19 h pH dropped to 6.2 and decrease of hydrogen production was observed. Cessation of H2 production was noticed after 40 h, even though substrate was present in the bioreactor and it was still consumed (Fig. 4 ). It could be related with utilization of part of the substrate for growth, maintenance or PHB (poly-β-hydroxybutyrate) formation [35]. Fig. 4 presents the changes in concentration of metabolites during photofermentation process with R. sphaeroides. VFAs produced in dark fermentation were completely utilized by photofermentative bacteria. It is worth noting that, R. sphaeroides preferred VFAs over xylitol for H2 production. However, xylitol was also slowly utilized and after 80 h it was completely consumed by bacteria. Results presented in this figure are in line with those obtained by other authors. Uyar et al. [36] studying the influence of VFAs on photofermentation with R. sphaeroides established that malate, propionate and lactate were suitable substrates for hydrogen production, whereas PHB was the main product formed from butyrate [32]. The ratio between butyrate and acetate in the medium (HBu/HAc) has a large influence on the hydrogen production process [13,37]. Changes of this value caused changes in the metabolism and in consequence influenced the microorganisms growth and products accumulation. When the concentration of acetate in the reaction medium was lower than 15 mM, the growth of bacteria prevailed over the hydrogen formation [4]. On the other hand, when concentration of butyrate was too high (>20 mM) the substrate inhibition occurred [4,38]. Data in Table 5 and in Fig. 4 show higher concentration of butyrate over acetate in the effluent originating from the dark fermentation. Thus, in our studies the high ratio of HBu/HAc could influence hydrogen evolution and decreased the amount of hydrogen produced by R. sphaeroides. Similar effect was observed by Ren et al. [37] when Rhodopseudomonas faecalis RLD-53 bacteria were applied. They demonstrated the drop of photohydrogen production for high concentrations of butyric acid."
8,Hybrid system,"3.3 Hybrid system In recent years the hybrid system for microbiological hydrogen production has been proposed. It appeared that combination of dark fermentation and photofermentation led to better yields of hydrogen. Hybrid systems can operate both in one-step or two-step (sequential) systems. In one step process both dark and photo-fermentation cultures coexist in one bioreactor with light transparent walls or optical fibers supplying light to the bioreactor. In two step systems, hydrogen and various liquid metabolites are initially produced during dark fermentation. Then the effluent containing mainly VFAs is directed to the photobioreactor containing appropriate photobacteria. In one-step hybrid systems a limited access of light, substrate inhibition, pH conditions or high concentration of ammonium ions can significantly decrease the amount of produced hydrogen [39]. Therefore, the two-step hybrid systems are often preferred. In our studies, the amount of produced hydrogen in sequential dark and photo-fermentation was three fold higher than in dark fermentation process. The substrate yield increased from 0.24 mM H2/g of waste to 0.77 mM H2/g of waste. The H2 production yield increased from 1.8 mM H2/g CODremoved to 4.7 mM H2/g CODremoved in experiments with waste containing 67 g/L. In this case the total volume of produced hydrogen for the most efficient sequential dark and photo-fermentation experiment was close to 6.7 L/Lmedium. Data in Table 8 present the results of H2 production in two-step hybrid systems for different wastes with various substrates. The final amount of hydrogen produced in hybrid system with chewing gum waste as a substrate, proved this waste can be efficiently applied in hydrogen production."
9,Conclusions,"It was established that wastes originating from chewing gum production can be efficiently applied in hydrogen production in two-step fermentative hybrid systems. Here, the suspensions containing Talha gum and small quantities of glycerol are efficiently transformed into hydrogen and liquid metabolites (VFAs) in dark fermentation process. Subsequently these metabolites and xylitol can generate additional amount of hydrogen in photofermentative process with R. sphaeroides. Total volume of produced hydrogen in both steps under optimized conditions reached 6.7 L H2/L of non-diluted waste. The loss of organic compounds (COD consumption) after dark fermentation was close to 30%, whereas in photofermentation it reached 50%."
