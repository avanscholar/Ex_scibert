0,Introduction,"Splitting water into stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and oxygen using sunlight is considered to be a promising strategy for renewable energy storage [1–3]. Despite enormous efforts have been devoted to overall water splitting, so far, no such a process has been commercialized for practical application due to the limited solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency and high cost. The water oxidation half reaction, which requires multiple proton-electron transfer processes, is believed to account for the low energy conversion efficiency [4–6]. Furthermore, the byproduct oxygen has limited practical applications, and the backward reaction caused by the interaction between the evolved oxygen and hydrogen is quite harmful to photocatalytic overall water splitting [7]. In addition to hydrogen production, the replacement of the water oxidation half reaction by novel value-added substrate oxidation reaction is an attractive way to generate useful oxidation products [8]. The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is a fundamental organic transformation both in laboratory synthesis and industrial production since benzaldehyde is widely used as intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fragrances [9,10]. However, current studies for benzyl alcohol oxidation usually require oxygen as an electron acceptor, and some of them are operated under extreme conditions [11–13]. On the other hand, the extensively reported photocatalytic hydrogen production in the presence of a sacrificial agent has an unclear prospect in practical application due to that the participation of a sacrificial agent will highly increase the cost for real production. As a consequence, solar-driven hydrogen production coupled with selective benzyl alcohol oxidation with highly improved atom economy is very interesting for sustainable energy conversion. Two value-added products including a solar fuel and a solar chemical can be simultaneously generated during this visible-light-driven catalytic process. In the past few decades, various photocatalysts with suitable bandgaps have been developed for hydrogen production [14,15]. Among them, CdS and ZnS have attracted much attention because of their intrinsic electronic and optical properties [16–18]. It is well known that CdS is an excellent photocatalyst with high activity for hydrogen production. However, fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and the lack of stability to resist undesirable photocorrosion limit the wide applications of CdS [19,20]. Meanwhile, ZnS is one of the widely used photocatalysts with a wide bandgap (3.6 eV) and highly negative reduction potential of photoexcited electrons [21]. Unfortunately, the bandgap of ZnS is too large to respond under visible light irradiation. As an alternative, high quality Zn1 − x Cd x S solid solutions with tunable compositions as well as optical and electric properties have great potential applications in photocatalysis, coloring, and optoelectronic devices [22–24]. Herein, we report that Ni-modified Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Ni/ZnCdS) solid solution can efficiently split benzyl alcohol into hydrogen and benzaldehyde with good selectivity under visible light irradiation. Compared with pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S (ZnCdS), the hydrogen production rate in this noble-metal-free photocatalytic system can be enhanced by more than 1000 times, which corresponds to a high apparent quantum yield of 52.5% at 420 nm. The close contact between Ni species and ZnCdS was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images. In addition, high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of Ni species proved the presence of metallic Ni (Ni0). A possible reaction mechanism is proposed based on the results."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All the chemicals, including benzyl alcohol (99.0%), benzaldehyde (98.5%), acetonitrile (99.0%), cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, 98.5%), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, 99.0%), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, 99.0%), and nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 98.0%), were commercially available and used without further purification."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation Zn x Cd1 − x S nanoparticles with diameters of approximately 15–25 nm were prepared according to a previous published procedure [25]. Since the ongoing studies in our group showed that the Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution (with x = 0.5) without Ni species exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production rate under visible light irradiation, this composition was selected in the present study. In a typically synthesis of Zn0.5Cd0.5S (ZnCdS), 7.59 mmol of Cd(OAc)2·2H2O and 7.59 mmol of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O were dispersed in 35 mL of deionized water to form a mixture solution. Then, 35 mL of 0.5 M Na2S aqueous solution was added dropwise at a speed of 0.5 mL min−1 under continuous stirring. After stirring for another 12 h, the resulting yellow slurry was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 16 h. The final product was collected by centrifugation, fully rinsed with distilled water and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. CdS and ZnS were prepared by a similar method in the absence of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, respectively. Note that pure hexagonal CdS was obtained by hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 48 h. Ni-modified ZnCdS (Ni/ZnCdS) was prepared by an in situ photoreduction method. Typically, 5 mg of ZnCdS and a certain amount of NiCl2·6H2O was dispersed in a round-bottomed flask with 20 mL of absolute benzyl alcohol, the suspension was degassed and then irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp, leading to the in situ formation of metallic Ni on the surface of ZnCdS. For comparison, NiO-decorated ZnCdS (NiO/ZnCdS) was prepared by a two-step method. First, Ni/ZnCdS was obtained by photodeposition for 3 h with the optimal amount of nickel salt added. The precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol. The resulting product was kept at 80 °C for 24 h in air to obtain NiO/ZnCdS. ZnCdS loaded with 0.5 wt% Pt was also prepared by in situ photodeposition while replacing nickel salt with H2PtCl6 as Pt source."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZnCdS nanoparticles were obtained from X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-TTR III) using graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation of 1.54178 Å at a scanning rate of 5° min−1 from 20° to 80° (2θ). The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 200 mA, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy-dispersed X-ray analysis were performed using a JSM-6700F field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained from a JEM-2010 electron microscopy, operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were carried out on a SOLID 3700 UV–vis spectrometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra for solid samples were investigated through a JY Fluorolog-3-Tou instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed in an ultrahigh vacuum ESCALAB 250 instrument."
5,Photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation,"2.4 Photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation To investigate the photocatalytic activities of Ni/ZnCdS nanoparticles for hydrogen evolution from benzyl alcohol, 5 mg of ZnCdS and a certain amount of NiCl2·6H2O were added into a 50 mL round-bottom flask contained with 20 mL of absolute benzyl alcohol at the ambient temperature and pressure. A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used for visible light irradiation. Before irradiation, the solution was bubbled with high purity nitrogen for 15 min to completely remove the air inside and ensure the system was in an anaerobic condition. The gas product hydrogen was measured by gas chromatography (GC, SP-6890, nitrogen as a carrier gas) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using methane as the internal standard. To evaluate the yields for benzaldehyde evolution over Ni/ZnCdS sample, acetonitrile was used as the solvent and other experimental conditions were the same as the above-mentioned conditions. After photocatalytic reaction, the mixture was centrifuged to remove the solid catalyst. Then, the supernatant liquid containing benzyl alcohol and its oxidation products were injected into gas chromatography (GC1690, argon as a carrier gas) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using a PEG-20 M 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm × 30 m capillary column. The temperature of column oven was initially kept at 60 °C for 3 min. Then, it was increased to 230 °C at a rate of 15 °C min−1. External standard method was used to quantitatively determine the yields of benzaldehyde, and the GC data along with standard curves for benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde production are shown in Fig. S6. Furthermore, the liquid products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Trace 1300, Thermo scientific). All the rates for the products are average values in the first three hours. Apparent quantum yield (A.Q.Y.) was measured using a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm band-pass filter and calculated according to the following equation. The reaction was carried out in a 50 mL flask with 5.0 mg of ZnCdS and 0.5 mg of NiCl2·6H2O dispersed in 20 mL of absolute benzyl alcohol solution. Before irradiation, the flask was purged with nitrogen to remove air, and then the flask was irradiated with an illumination area at about 6 cm2 for 2 h to induce the deposition of metallic Ni. After deposition, the illumination area was controlled to 1.2 × 1.2 cm2 to improve the accuracy of light intensity of the irradiation region. AQY ( % ) = number of reacted electrons number of incident photons × 100 % = number of evolved H 2 molecules × 2 number of incident photons × 100 % The conversion percentage of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity for benzaldehyde were defined as follows: Conversion ( % ) = [ ( C 0 − C BO ) / C 0 ] × 100 % Selectivity ( % ) = [ C BD / ( C 0 − C BO ) ] × 100 % where C 0 is the initial concentration of benzyl alcohol, C BO and C BD are the concentrations of the detected benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde after illumination, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,"The solid solution Zn x Cd1 − x S nanoparticles were prepared by a solvothermal method, according to a previously described procedure [25]. Decoration of Ni nanoparticles onto the surface of ZnCdS was achieved through in situ photodeposition, in which benzyl alcohol acts as the electron donor. Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared Zn x Cd1 − x S (x = 0, 0.5, 1.0) samples. The results show that the diffraction peaks of CdS (x = 0) and ZnS (x = 1.0) samples are well indexed as hexagonal wurtzite CdS (PDF#41-1049) and cubic zinc blend ZnS (PDF#77-2100), respectively. Compared to pure ZnS and CdS, the peaks in the XRD pattern of ZnCdS have obvious shifts, indicating the successful formation of a solid solution rather than a physically mixed compound. The relatively lower crystallinity of Zn0.5Cd0.5S can be attributed to the distortion of the crystal structure caused by the incorporation of Zn2+ into the CdS lattice [26]. However, no obvious peak attributed to Ni species is presented in the XRD pattern of Ni/ZnCdS after the deposition reaction, which could be caused by its low loading amount and uniform dispersion. The surface morphologies of ZnCdS and Ni/ZnCdS samples were first investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. S1 shows the nanoparticle morphology of ZnCdS, and no obvious morphology change is observed for Ni/ZnCdS. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum of Ni/ZnCdS confirms the presence of Ni, Zn, Cd, and S elements (Fig. 2 a). Fig. 2(b) and (c) is the TEM images of ZnCdS and Ni/ZnCdS, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(b), bare ZnCdS sample is composed of a large number of nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 15 to 25 nm, which is consistent with the calculated size (∼21.8 nm) from the XRD data. Furthermore, the enlarged TEM image reveals the relatively smooth surfaces of the ZnCdS sample. However, ultrafine nanoparticles with a size of ∼5 nm are emerged for Ni/ZnCdS, which are well dispersed on the surface of ZnCdS (Fig. 2c), indicating the successful deposition of Ni. In addition, the HRTEM image of Ni/ZnCdS shows a lattice fringe spacing of d = 0.341 nm (Fig. 2d), which is in good agreement with the interplanar distance of the (1 1 0) plane of ZnCdS obtained from the XRD result. The measured lattice spacing of the tiny nanoparticle is 0.239 nm, corresponding to the (1 1 1) plane of NiO [27]. The unsurprising presence of NiO probably results from the oxidation of the highly active Ni nanocrystals on the semiconductor surface, and this phenomenon has been observed in many other reported literatures [28–30]. To investigate the surface chemical composition and valance state, the XPS spectrum of Ni/ZnCdS was measured. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the XPS survey spectrum of Ni/ZnCdS confirms the coexistent of Ni, Zn, Cd, S, and O, which is consistent with the EDX result (Fig. 2a). The C element located at 284.8 eV was used to calibrate the binding energies. And the high resolution XPS spectrum of Zn 2p (Fig. S2a) located at 1021.8 eV and 1044.8 eV exhibits a peak separation of 23.0 eV, suggesting the existence of Zn2+ [18,31]. The Cd 3d spectrum (Fig. S2b) exhibits two peaks located at 405.1 eV and 411.8 eV, which are in good agreement with the reported data for Cd 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 XPS peaks of Cd2+, respectively [32]. Furthermore, the peak positions of S 2p (Fig. S2c) at 161.6 eV and 162.6 eV suggest the presence of S2−. As shown in the high resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p (Fig. 3b), the distinct peak at 852.6 eV is attributed to metallic Ni signal [28,33], and the peak at around 855.5 eV is assigned to Ni2+ [34], probably because of the oxidation of metallic Ni. Photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in pure benzyl alcohol under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the concentration of NiCl2·6H2O in the original solution has a great influence on the rate of hydrogen production. Pure ZnCdS without the addition of NiCl2·6H2O was used for comparison. The results show that pure ZnCdS has a very slow hydrogen production rate of 0.5 µmol h−1, indicating that ZnCdS itself is not a good photocatalyst for dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. In contrast, with the addition of a small amount of nickel salt, a significant increase of hydrogen production rate is achieved, suggesting that Ni plays an important role in splitting of benzyl alcohol for hydrogen production. The highest photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production is 666.3 µmol h−1 when 0.5 mg of Ni salt is added, which is 1000 times higher than that of pure ZnCdS. However, further increasing the amount of nickel salt resulted in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity, this phenomenon is probably caused by the following factors: (1) plenty of Ni nanocrystals loaded on the ZnCdS solid solution can shield the incident light, suppressing the generation of photoinduced electrons from the conduction band of ZnCdS; (2) excess metallic Ni deposited on the surface of ZnCdS reduce the active sites where the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol occurs. In contrast, Fig. S3 shows the photocatalytic activity of ZnS and CdS under the same reaction conditions. No hydrogen was detected for ZnS system because of its incapability for visible light absorption. And the activity of Ni/ZnCdS is 1.8 times higher than that of Ni-modified CdS, indicating that the energy band positions of ZnCdS are more favorable for dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. Besides metallic Ni, some other cocatalysts were also studied for comparison (Fig. 4b). It is well known that platinum (Pt) is a highly efficient cocatalyst for hydrogen evolution from water splitting [35,36]. Compared with Ni-modified ZnCdS, the optimal 0.5 wt% Pt-loaded ZnCdS sample shows a much lower hydrogen production rate of 52.7 µmol h−1 (Fig. S4), indicating that Pt could not function as an efficient cocatalyst for extracting hydrogen from benzyl alcohol, which is consistent with our previous study and other reported result [37,38]. Negligible hydrogen was produced when NiO-modified ZnCdS was employed, indicating the inactive nature of NiO as a cocatalyst for splitting of benzyl alcohol. Moreover, its catalytic activity is even lower than that of the bare ZnCdS, because of the shield effect of NiO. This observation further confirms that the metallic Ni functioned as the key cocatalyst in the present Ni/ZnCdS photocatalytic system for hydrogen production. Furthermore, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) for hydrogen production was measured under 420 nm monochromatic light (Fig. 4c). Initially, 5 mg of ZnCdS and 0.5 mg of nickel salt were added into 20 mL benzyl alcohol. Then, the AQY measurement was started after the photodeposition of Ni0 for 2 h. Remarkably, an extremely high apparent quantum yield of 52.5% was achieved after irradiation for 8 h. As far as we know, this is one of the highest AQY for splitting alcohols into hydrogen driven by visible light [8,37]. To investigate the stability of the Ni/ZnCdS photocatalytic system, long-term hydrogen production from absolute benzyl alcohol under 420 nm monochromatic light was performed (Fig. 4d). After illumination for 50 h, a total amount of 2.15 mmol hydrogen was evolved. It is worth nothing that no signal of decrease of hydrogen production rate exists during 50 h, indicating the high stability of the Ni/ZnCdS system. Benzaldehyde is not only an important intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals but also could be used in fragrance industries. To confirm the simultaneous generation of hydrogen and benzaldehyde within the Ni/ZnCdS system, photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol was examined in 20 mL of acetonitrile with different amounts of benzyl alcohol, and the liquid mixture after reaction were also quantified by gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). As shown in Fig. 5 , both hydrogen and benzaldehyde are simultaneously produced, and their production rates were both improved with increasing amount of benzyl alcohol. Specifically, when the initial addition of benzyl alcohol was 100 µL, 284.8 µmol of hydrogen and 223.8 µmol of benzaldehyde were simultaneously evolved after 3 h, corresponding to a conversion efficiency of 40.4% for benzyl alcohol, with a selectivity of 57.7% for benzaldehyde. Besides benzaldehyde, some other by-products such as hydrobenzoin and benzil were also emerged (Fig. S5), indicating the presence of intermediate carbon-centered benzyl radical [37,39]. To understand the mechanism for the excellent photocatalytic activity of Ni/ZnCdS for dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol, UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra were performed to explore the optical absorption properties of ZnCdS and Ni/ZnCdS (Fig. 6 a). A sharp absorption edge at around 480 nm is observed for ZnCdS, corresponding to the bandgap of 2.58 eV. Compared with ZnCdS, a broad background absorption from 500 nm to 1000 nm is appeared for Ni/ZnCdS. This is attributed to the dark color of Ni/ZnCdS, resulting in the enhancement of light absorption. Moreover, there is no significant absorption edge change after the photodeposition of Ni, indicating that Ni nanocrystals are just attached to the surface of ZnCdS rather than incorporated into its lattice. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was further employed to evaluate the separation and recombination of photoinduced charge carriers in the photocatalyst. Fig. 6(b) shows that the PL spectrum of pure ZnCdS possesses two emission bands with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. The minor emission band at 467 nm was attributed to excitonic band edge emission. A broad emission band at around 500–850 nm was also observed, which may be originated from the defect-mediated charge recombination on the ZnCdS surface, and the concave located at 650 nm is caused by the switchover of optical grating. Interestingly, these emissions were remarkably quenched upon photodeposition of Ni0, which can be attributed to the efficient transfer of electrons from ZnCdS to Ni0, leading to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, Ni0 nanocrystals have been reported to play an important role in activating the α-C–H bond [40,41], which is a kinetically key step toward dehydrogenation of alcohols. As a result, the highly improved separation of photogenerated carriers and the accelerated α-C–H bond cleavage by the photodeposited Ni0 nanocrystals should account for the greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity of Ni/ZnCdS photocatalyst. Based on the above results and analyses, a potential reaction mechanism is given in Scheme 1 . Initially, plenty of photoexcited electrons and holes are generated when ZnCdS are irradiated by the incident photons with energy larger than the bandgap of the photocatalyst. Ni0 nanocrystals are immediately generated and closely attached on the surface of ZnCdS by the electrons located at the conduction band. Then, Ni0 nanocrystals function as trap states to capture the electrons from the conduction band of ZnCdS. One proton is abstracted from the hydroxyl group of benzyl alcohol, and an alkoxide anion could be generated at the same time [42]. Subsequently, the alkoxide anion will react with the photogenerated hole from the valance band of ZnCdS [11], and the cleavage of α-C–H bond occurs on the surface of Ni0 sites [41], resulting in the formation of carbon-centered radical during this deprotonation process. Finally, the carbon-centered radical is further oxidized by the hole, leading to the formation of benzaldehyde, and the protons absorbed on Ni0 nanocrystals are reduced into hydrogen simultaneously."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, we have demonstrated the efficient hydrogen production from benzyl alcohol under ambient conditions without the use of any noble metal cocatalyst. An impressive apparent quantum yield of 52.5% for hydrogen evolution is achieved. The highly improved activity for hydrogen evolution is attributed to the intimate contact between metallic Ni nanocrystals and ZnCdS solid solution. Ni0 nanocrystals can highly accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and the subsequent bond cleavage of α-C–H during dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. The present study can be helpful to establish some other potential catalytic systems involved with value-added oxidation reactions as well as hydrogen evolution or CO2 reduction processes.
